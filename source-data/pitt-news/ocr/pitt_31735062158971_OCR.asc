hand glimpse into the smallness
of the so-called “big shot” who
turns out to be merely a weak
imitation of a ward-heeler.

Last week, West Park recre-
ational center, located in the
notoriously underprivileged
North Side, was padlocked be-
cause a couple of well-fed politi-
-cians couldn’t straighten out an
insignificant squabble. The whole
business was so very petty that it’s
a little bit humiliating to confess
that this city has in its employ
men who are not big enough to
arise above that pettness.

Let us uncover the facts. J. A.
MacGowan, federal co-ordinatorﬁ
for WPA recreational activities,
accused the city of slighting the
the WPA and ignoring the “good
work” it has done.

Closes Center

Louis C. Schroeder, city recrea-
tional superintendent, refused to
make an issue of it. He closed the
center instead.

We have almost resigned our-
selves to the status quo brought
about by the arguments of city
officials who attempt to run things
to suit themselves.

But why take it out on the
three hundred kids who are sorely
in need of a recreational program?

No one suffers from the closing
of a. playground or recreation cen-
ter except the kids who play
there. Leaders in recreational ac-
tivity should be the first to rea-
lize that fact.

According to MacGowan, Schroe-
der circulated a letter among
Northsiders urging them to visit
the center to see what it was do-
ing to develop their children. No
mention of the WPA was made,
although two of its supervisors
were in charge.

MacGowan said that after he
complained of the “sight," Schroe-
der closed the place for the win-
ter and placed the WPA workers
elsewhere.

Different Story A

Schroeder’s story differs. He
admitted signing the letter and of
making no mention of the WPA
although he meant no slight and
had no criticism of WPA work.

He had intended, he said, to
close the center anyway because
it is “not my policy” to operate a
center without city supervision.

If Louis Schroeder has a legiti-
mate reason for shutting down
the West Park Center, then the
parents, whose children have been
flipped the cards from the bottom
of the deck, ought to hear about
it.

If the center has been closed
for no better reason than we un-
derstand to be true, then certainly
that explains why Pittsburgh is
far behind the other cities in pro-
moting progressive recreation and
leisure-time activity program.

It does not matter to the child-
ren who pays the leaders that
guide their play, as long as those
leaders show intelligence in their
work. Essential is the fact that
we must keep the kids off the
streets.

We realize what vanity can do
to men, but come now Mr. Mac-
Gowan and Mr. Schroeder, bring
your dishes and come over and
play in our backyard.

‘Flower Ball’ Motif

Set For Junior Prom

Hoping to begin a tradition an-
alagous to that of the Ivy Ball at
Penn and the Ring Dance at Navy,
the Junior Prom this year will be
officially designated as the “Flow-
er Ball” and all parts of the dance
from the advertising posters to the
decorations will follow a primary
scheme of ﬂoral decoration.

The Prom, usually accepted as
the outstanding formal event of
the school year at the University,
will be held in the ballroom of
the William Penn Hotel on Friday
evening, January 14.

The ﬂower motif will be prin-
cipally displayed in a garland-
packed ballroom, its four walls
covered with thousands of ﬂowers
of all kinds to greet the dancers as
they enter. Corsages will be pre-
sented to each girl as she passes
the door.

Tickets and‘ the posters adver-
tising the Ball will all contain a
ﬂoral design to further carry out

the motif, while a proposed pro-
gram patterned after the idea of
Life magazine will also feature
the central theme.

The program will contain photo-
graphs of the committee and a
running story of the history and
procedure of the management of
the dance.

No orchestra has been chosen as
yet because, to quote Bud Mayer,
and Bob Dannies, BA, chairman
and business manager of the
dance, “We want to get the big-
gest name band available at the
time. The orchestra will be chosen
during the Christmas holidays and
will be announced at the resump-
tion of school in January.”

The price of the tickets has
been tentatively set at $4 per cou-
ple.

A meeting of the entire commit-
tee will be held this afternoon at
1:30 o’clock in 221 Cathedral. At-
tendance is compulsory.

Peace Policy
Of President

Censured

Teachers, Students
Criticize Roosevelt’s

International Stand

BY GERALD N. ZISKIND

President Franklin D. Roose-
velt’s international policy has
met strong criticism on the camp-
us, according to information from
student and faculty leaders inter-
ested in the peace movement.

Encountering the most stubborn
opposition in his emphatic demand
to the Mikado for personal apolo-
gy as a result of the Panay inci-
dent, he is charged with directly
endangering national peace.

SEEKS IMPOSSIBLE

‘ “The President may face a re-
sounding defeat in the eyes of fu-
ture historians,” said Dr. Benja-
min Williams, professor of inter-
national law, “if he pursues his
present militaristic attitude to its
ultimate conclusion. In his at-
tempt to force Japan’s Mikado to
apologize personally, he is fooling
around with dynamite. The Mika-
do, according to Japanese tradition,
is not a government official but a
god to be worshipped.

“By forcing this ‘god’ to make
reply, the President seeks the im-
possible. Japan has already made
adequate reparation by its agree-
ment to pay indemnity and punish
aviators responsible for the inci-
dent.

UNITED YOUTH

‘‘I’m afraid that we are now
witnessing another Wilsonian
practice of going to the extreme
in. demanding our rights,” Dr.
Williams added. “It would be a
calamity indeed, should the Pres-
ident plunge us into war because
of poor diplomatic tact.”

General concensus among stud-
ents ran high against the Presi-
dent’s demands. Miss Rosemary
Lutz, C39, president of Peace

Charity Drive
Exceeds Quota

Exceeding the quota by $94.10,
faculty and students of the Uni-
versity subscribed $10,094.10 to-
ward the 1937 Community Fund
drive.

This oversubscription, according
to J . G. Quick, registrar, made the
school “one of the few groups in
the Public Affairs Division to go
over its quota.” The 831 faculty
members gave an average of $8.84
each, contributing $51.40 more
than their quota of $7,300. Over-
subscribing by $42.70, the student
body of 2,833 pledged $2,742.70
for an average contribution of 97;
cents.

Alumni Group
Attends Rites
For Dr. Foster

Members of the University
Alumni Council will attend the
funeral of Dr. Charles R. Foster,
today at 1 o’clock in the Third
Presbyterian church, Fifth avenue
and N egley street. Dr. Foster died
Tuesday afternoon as he was en-
tering the Faculty Club dining
room in the Cathedral.

A national-known educator, he
had been superintendent of Pitts-
burgh public schools since 1936,
when, because of political pres-
sure, he resigned as president of
the State Teacher’s College at In-
diana, Pa., a post he had held
since 1927. He was an associate
superintendent from 1905/ to 1927.

Born in Oil City, Dr. Foster
graduated from Clarion State
Teachers college in 1896 and from
the University in 1911. He was
awarded a master’s degree in
1911 and in 1925 won the degree
of LL.D. He then began teaching
in North Versailles township and
later became a high school prin-
cipal in McKeesport.

Dr. Foster’s death came as a
shock to his associates as he was
believed to be in good health.
Tuesday, he had addressed a
meeting of principals of the 12
city high schools in the board of
education building and had dis-
cussed a new method of record
keeping for two hours.

With Dr. Foster when he col-
lapsed were Dr. Ben G. Graham,
superintendent of schools and Dr.
John F. Guy, associate superin-
tendent.

Designs Arrive
For Rumanian,

English Rooms

Monastery, Foreign
Universities Furnish
Motifs For Rooms

Plans for the Ruinanian
Room and the English Room,
two of the 19 nationality rooms
for the Cathedral, were re-
ceived this week.

Drawings for the limestone
doorway and the wood paneling
of the Rumanian Room came
to the Rumanian committee this
week from Bucharest. The de-
sign for the room was inspired by
the interior details of the monas-
tery at Horoz, built under the pa-
tronage of Prince Constantine
Brancovenaue, a contemporary of
Louis XIV of France.

In accordance with traditions,
the name of the architect, N. Ghi-
ca-Budesti, will be engraved in
the stone of the room.

Plans for the English Room,
designed by W. H. Godfrey, Eng-
lish architect, have recently been
forwarded from England, where
the English Room committee, un-
der Dr. Albert Mansbridge, head
of the World Association for
Adult Education, is working on
the project. Dr. Mansbridge vis-
ited Pittsburgh in 1934 and was
greatly impressed by the Cathe-
dral.

The design for the English
Room will resemble the collegi-
ate architecture of Oxford and
Cambridge, the broad essentials
of which are oak-panelled walls
and an oak-boarded ﬂoor.

Holiday Note

The Christmas recess in all
schools will begin Monday, accord-
ing to information released from
the office of the registrar. Classes
will be resumed on Monday, Jan-

Peace Council
Sends 350 Cards
To Washington

Over 350 students VVednes-
day sent in requests to Wash-
ington for the U. S. to take
steps to avoid Far Eastern “in-
cidents.”

The students obtained their
cards to mail to the capitol
from two booths that the Pitt
Peace Council set up on the
ground floor and eighth floor of
the Cathedral. Under the direction
of Rosemary Lutz, C39, the Coun-
cil attempted to register student
opinion in the recent developments
in the Far East.

STATE-WIDE CAMPAIGN

The Peace Council's work, ac-
cording to Miss Lutz, is part of
the state-wide Emergency Peace
Campaign activities this week.
Students were supplied with
sample messages addressed to
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
and to Secretary of State Cordell
Hull.

In approximately 175 messages
sent to the President and 185 to
Mr. Hull, students expressed their
opposition to the U. S. continuing
to keep ships in the war zone,
which, they said, might result in
“incidents” leading to participa-
tion in the war by the U. S.

At an intercollegiate meeting
held Tuesday, representatives of
peace groups from four Pittsburgh
campi discussed plans for launch-
ing an inter-campus peace move-
ment.

RADIO SYIVIPOSIUM

Ideas for a radio symposium on
peace to be conducted by repre-
sentatives from Pittsburgh univer-
sities and colleges in January were
considered at the meeting. Stud-
ents present also discussed plans
for a state-wide institute Febru-
ary 22 to form a college peace
platform for Western Pennsylvan-

1a.

Pitt Peace Council was repre-
sented at the meeting by Miss
Lutz. Other delegates at the
Tuesday meeting were Ruth
Brodie, Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology; Alvin Porsche, Duquesne
University; and Marie McConnell,
Mt. Mercy college.

Christmas spirit will invade
the Commons Room of the Cathe-
dral today during the activities
hour, when members of the Men’s
Glee Club, Women’s Choral, and
freshman women’s Glee Club
Unit gather to sing traditional
Christmas Carols.
Mr. Russel Wichmann, organist
from the Shadyside Presbyterian
church, will accompany the group
on the Hammond electric organ.
Mrs. Fred Lissfelt, director of
Women’s Choral, ,:and Theodore
Finney, director of Men’s Glee

Club, will lead the singers.

University Receives

One of the most complete col-
lections of musical recordings ever
compiled, arrived at the Universi-
ty this week, prepared by the
Carnegie corporation and donated
by the Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Teaching.

The collection is comprised of
recordings representing over 900
separate compositions for every
k n o w n musical combination.
Scores for all the works, musical
reference, and a catalog complete
the set.

FOR SFA PROGRAMS

The recordings will be used in
the SFA Concert Hour programs
and in the musical appreciation
classes of Theodore M. Finney,
lecturer in musical appreciation
and faculty adviser to the Con-
cert Hour committee.

“We will begin using the collec-
tion in the programs we have
planned for the rest of the year,”
stated Robert Brown, C39, head
of the committee. “With such a
comprehensive set of records, we
will be able to fill practically all
the requestspthat have been re-
ceived to play specific works on
the Wednesday afternoon pro-

‘Collection Of Records

A_
7

grams.”

Brown also announced the plan
of the committee to run special
programs for students who have
more than a lay interest in music.

“At monthly intervals we will
have fairly obscure periods of
musical history illustrated by
some of the recordings,” he stat-
ed.

SPECIAL CONCERTS

“For example, we could run off
a program on the early Italian
church music, or the development
of the song in the nineteenth cen-
tury. At these concerts, Mr. Fin-
ney, who possesses special knowl-
edge on these subjects through his
research into musicology, will
comment on the works to be
play .”

An idea of the extensiveness of
the collection may be gained by
the fact that the works of Johann
Sebastian Bach cover five pages
of the catalog. All of the Beethov-
en symphonies, most of Schubert’s
songs, and the complete pianoforte
works of Frederich Chopin are in-
cluded. Modern jazz is represented
by recordings of Duke Ellington
and Louis Armstrong.

Students Consider
War Inevitable

Fifth Poll Shows I
Campus Voters
  Desire Neutrality

By RAY C. MacINTYRE

Asserting by and large that
war is never desirable, but in
the sa.me ﬁgurative breath
sighing that mass warfare is in-
evitable, students at the Uni-
versity, in the ﬁfth Campus
Opinion poll conducted by The
Pitt‘ News last week, stamped
themselves as opportunists hoping
to avert immediate catastrophe,
but differing in their notions as
to how it could be done.

Students voted 83 per cent that
war is undesirable, but at the
same time 67 per cent to 33 per
cent that mass warfare can never
be eliminated.

U. S. NEUTRALITY

Offered three alternatives in
the matter of policy to be pursued
by the U. S. in time of armed con-
flict between foreign nations, the
majority of those questioned de-
clared by a vote of 80 per cent to
20 per cent that the U. S. govern-
ment should tend strictly to its
own business and preserve a dip-
lomatic neutrality.

Many students showed a lack of
comprehension of the problem,
when, given a choice between
three clearly defined policies,
they designated two, and in some
cases all three, to be followed
simultaneously. The choices of
general policy suggested were:

GENERAL POLICY

a. That the U. S. government
should endeavor to put a stop to
all wars, both present and future,
by co-operating with other peace-
ful nations in concerted economic
action to defeat aggressor nations.

b. That the U. S. government
should look to its own best in-
terests, and assist that nation
whose ends accomplished are most
likely to enhance and preserve
the strength and power of the U.
S. government in the international
economic field.

c. That the U. S. government
should tend strictly to its own
business, and preserve a diplomat-
ic neutrality in case of wars be-
tween foreign nations.

In the matter of more specific
economic measures to be taken on
such occasions, students plead
their ignorance. The majority did
not check this question, while
others answered it in flippant
fashion.

Worthwhile results, of course,
were not obtained. The only sig-
nificant fact brought out by the
query was that students simply
did not know, and in many cases
have not thought about the mat-
ter. Neutrality to them is a name
and a sentiment. A

ECONOMIC MEASURES

The following economic meas-
ures were suggested:

a. U. S. government should place
an embargo on all trade with be-
ligerent nations.

b. U. S. government should
carry on trade as usual with bell-
igerent nations.

c. U. S. government should only
refuse to deal in war materials
with belligerent nations.

d. The people, not the U. S.
government, should, through the
instrumentality of labor unions,
effect a boycott on aggressor na-
tion goods. _

A national referendum in the
event of a declaration of war be-
ing contemplated by the U. S.
government, proposed in the sev-
enth and last question of the poll,
sounded like a good idea to stud-
ents. They gave it hearty support

cent that this procedure should be
followed.

Laughing at the outmoded be-

E. A. Holbrook,
Dean of the

sciences and does not mind being
a part of the minority of her
classes, there is no reason why
she should not followthe exam-
ple of a few of her braver sisters
and study engineering.”

Indicating that the only limita-
tion to the study of engineering
by women is their own inclina-
tion, Mr. Holbrook revealed
that some women are most sus-
cessful technical secretaries to
industrial executives. Several
leading consulting industrial en-
gineers in the nation and a num-
ber of research engineers are
women.

“For at least 40 years there
have been a few women students
at the largest engineering schools
in the East,” continues Mr. Hol-
brook. “They have completed
successfully and without embar-
rassment, curricula in at least

civil, architectural, electrical,
chemical, general, and industrial
engineering.

“Girls entering college who dis-
like mathematics or science
should not enroll for an engi-
neering course,” advises Mr. Hol-
brook in conclusion. “Some who
do well in the early years of the
course become bored with the
frank, economic, or dollar-and-
cents applications of engineering
principles which go with applied
engineering subjects.”

Student Groups
To Take Social
Industrial Trip

Representatives from Pe nn
State and the University will start
the annual Social Industrial trip
by meeting Tuesday morning at 9
o’clock, at the Community Fund
building, 519 Smithfield street.

Sponsored by Penn State, the
Social Industrial Inquiry trip
takes students to places of social
and industrial interest.

At the Community Fund build-
ing, representatives will visit the
Social Security exchange to ob-
serve the intricate system of filing
social security cards. Then the
group will go to the downtown
YMCA to discuss with an Amer-
ican Federation of Labor leader
the labor situation.

Vocational Conference Series

A series of vocational confer-¢

cnces for sophomore women
sponsored by WSGA was con-
cluded Wednesday by Dr. Mary
Wargo, lecturer in physics at the
University.

October 15, the series opened
with a general survey of voca-

tional opportunities by Dr. Edwin
A. Lee, who spoke on “Getting
Ready for Your Job.” Dr. Lee,
director of the National Occupa-
tional Conference of New York
and past president of the Ameri-
can Vocational association, is a
recognized authority in his ﬁeld
and lectured in the Pittsburgh
public schools, under the sponsor-
ship of the Board of Education.

Subjects of the subsequent for-
ums were selected according to
the choices the sophomore wo-
men made on their enrollment



Since the most popular choice
was teaching, there were two
meetings on education: one by
Dr. Charles E. Prall, dean of the
School of Education, who spoke
on “Prospects in Teaching;” and

another by Theodore Siedle, as-
sistant dean of the School of Ed-
ucation, whose topic was “Per-
sonal; Qualiﬁcations in Teachers.”

These discussions were open to
anyone who wished to attend but
especially concerned sophomores
interested in elementary and sec-
ondary education.

Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean
of the School of Business Admin-
istration, and Marion Hathway,
assistant professor of social work,
addressed the third and fourth
forums.

These conferences were syon-
sored by the vocational informa-
tion committee of WSGA, work-
ing with Miss Frances McLaugh-
lin and headed by Dorothy Der-
ing, C39. ‘

The committee is planning fu-
ture forums for junior women,
similar to those just presented,
which will include information
on retail training and journalism.
They intend also to contain some-
thing helpful for the women who
will ﬁnish this year.

New ‘Bushel’
Answers

Tom Smith, C39, Panther edi-
tor, thought that at least once a
month, “he knew all the-answers”
—-—at least to the questions in his
“Under a Bushel.”

But a few minutes before the
magazine went to press, he dis-
covered that the writers of the
feature had neglected to give him
the answers. ~ .

Herewith are the belated
swers. “Maybe it wasn’t. so
at that,” Smith declared. “At
least the kids couldn’t cheat, and
then try to impress their friends
with their cleverness.”

Disappearance
  Of ‘Twelfth Tree’

Creates Enigma

Not only will Santa Claus have
a hard time ﬁnding the Cathe-
dral’s chimney this Christmas, but
the old gentleman will ﬁnd it im-
possible to visit all of the big
building’s Christmas trees.

Placed in the Cathedral are 15
Christmas trees. Eleven of these
are in the.Commons,Room, one in

After the trees were unloaded,
George counted twelve of them.

POSSIBLE CLUES

A short time later George count-
ed the trees, found only eleven.
After almost a week, no clues as
to the missing treefs whereabouts
have been found. The eleven
trees are spruces, tall dark green
and weighing about fifteen
pounds. ’

Meanwhile, the following clues

have turned up, which may or may
not have some bearing on the
Missing Twelfth Tree:

(a) There is a balsam in the li-
brary. Small, about three feet,
six; weight, oh, about four pounds;
color, green. Other data: decora-
tions by the library staff. Tree
has been sitting in same place
since last Saturday. It is too small
to be missing tree. .

(‘b.) The tree in Robert X. Gra-
ham’s office: Medium height,
weight, about ﬁfteen pounds, col-
or, dark green. Other data: tree
allegedly cut down by Bob Sepic,
C40, who single-handed, braved
last Saturday’s winds to obtain
the hemlock. (Hard, to blame for
the crime, since missing tree is
spruce. Master Sepic’s is a hem-
lock.) Tree decorations supplied
by secretary Maxine Christensen
and others. Among the others is
Bill Murray, C39, who unwrapped
some Murray heirlooms, dating
back to 1919.

It is taller than missing tree.
Weight—couldn’t lift it. Decora-
tions, very nice, thanks to the
Evening School Association offic-
ers under Paul Hanna. Other data:
nicest smelling tree around.

(d.) Final suspect in the mystery
is the Faculty Club’s tree. A tall
green balsam. Decorations, nice;
weight, heavy; has been standing
since early this week. Hard to ac-
cuse of the crime since faculty
members have good alibi: their
tree is of a different family than
the missing one.

Summary: The Missing Twelfth
tree is liable to go down in his-
tory as one of 1937’s unsolved

crimes.

The score keepers will earn

RAMS GOOD

New York basketball aggrega-
tions are always tough. And the
Rams are no exception. They
have hei.ght, speed, sharp h00P
eyes, deception, gameness, P355"
ing ﬁnesse, and the physical
stamina to back them up, and
what more can be said. They are
more consistent under the basket
on set-up shots than the district
teams.

Coach Carlson intends to open
with the same quint that started
in the three previous contests. He
will place Captain Johnson and
Zeleznik at forwards, Garcia at
the pivot spot, and Radvansky
and Spotovich at guards. R.
Johnson II, Wolbers, Lawry, Mc-
Cance, Scott, l\/Iendlow, and Sher-
er will comprise the reserve out-
fit.

SUGAR BOWL

Not content with just sizing up

1e eastern situation, the locals
turn to the south December 29.
Here the Panther floor players
will inspect New Orleans, and,

incidentally, meet Kentucky’s
court stars in the Sugar Bowl
classic.

Pitt’s basketball playing eco-
nomic specialists are not expect-
ing very cordial welcome in
the south. The lampoons hurled at
the south’s and west’s football
representatives lately, will end to
make N w Orlean’s citizens a lit-

tle hostile. Things will pop in
the Sugar Bowl-—besides the
basketball.

Boxers Punch

Under Their
Mistletoe

It may be the beginning of va-
cation to you, but to Jack Shrick-
er’s leather-pushers it still is the
punching bag instead of the mis-
tletoe.

Because of the proximity of the
ﬁrst match, January 15 with
Bucknell, Coach Shricker is anx-
ious that his proteges remain in
shape. He is fearful that the box-
ers, now in top condition, might
indulge in too much holiday feast-
ing and return a little overstuffed
as they did after the Thanksgiv-
ing vacation. ,

The practice dates announced
by the coach are as follows: Sat-
urday, December 22, Thursday,
December 23, Tuesday, December
28, Wednesday, December 29. The
time that practice will be held is
from 10 to 12 o’clock.

All members of the team are
requested to keep this practice
schedule and make it a point to
be punctual.

Coach Shricker seems to have
a well rounded out team for the
coming year.

He has such worthies as Du-
rand, 125-pound intercollegiate
champ, Curzi in the 145-pound
class, Johny Wargo and Ralph
Caruso battling for the right to
represent the 135-pound division,
Homer Livingston, Turner at 145,
Lynch at 118, and Conti.

of college hockey, but their ef-
forts fell short and in turn drew
howls of laughter and yawns
from the surprising turn out of
nearly a thousand fans.

REAL HOCKEY

Some where between spills and
sprawls‘, Kelly took the puck
from Keane for the ﬁrst Redcat
goal at 6:05 and Carron from
Sinclair tallied at 8:30. In the
second period Gorman ﬁltered
through Tech defense and slam-
med one home with the time 8:50
and again Keane shot the puck
from the second lue line at 9:55
that found its way between goalie
Barefoot’s skates.

In sharp contrast did Duke and
Pit give and take for honors in
their half of the bargain bill. If
the paid admissions thought they
were in for another laugh session
they must have been severely
jolted, for the first whistle start-
ed one of the slam»-bangest hockey
games the Garden ice has played
host to in a mighty long time.

1\/{ANY PENALTIES

From the time Bill Vance
bounced one into the nets at 2:15
the going took on the aspect of
real hockey at itshardest. Bob
Schooley spilled Dukes with se-
vere fore checking, time and
again, before McGill ﬁnally drove
through a tight Pitt defense to
ring up Dukes’ second score. The
time, 8:30. ‘

The second period opened with
ﬁreworks and wild hockey that
saw ﬁve men go into the penalty
box. Burge, of Duquesne, was
ﬁrst thumbed to the penalty box
with charging into the sideboards,
an ample excuse.

Referee McGovern next chased
McGill and Conick for ﬁghting
before the Pitt cage. Schooley
and Bill Vance were his next vic-
tims and cooled 0H for ﬁve min-
utes because of excessive rough-
ness. '

KENNEDY SCORES

It was at this stage that Paul
Kennedy dribbled the puck in,
unasssisted, for Pitt’s only score
of the game.

The third period was a mild
anti-climax with only three" pen-
alties handed out. McGill was
again assigned to the box and

8:38 while Friday was conﬁned

First Yuietide

 

W AA in the spirit of Christmas
recently held its ﬁrst Yuletide
Feast which, it is hoped, will be-
come an annual affair.

Ancient customs were carried
out, even to the extent of eating
porkchops, baked beans, and
cranberry sauce without forks.

Dinner was eaten by the light
of candles in apple candleholders.
Between courses, the guests were
entertained by a boar’s head and
yulelog procession. The boar’s
head, according to custom, is car-
ried in on a plater by a page boy.
For this ceremony, however, the
head. of the animal was composed
of paper mache.

Roberta Webb, Ed39, dressed as
page boy, acted as master of cere-
monies, and Ruth Burry, Ed38,
was in charge of the affair which
proved WAA can have a good
time even when the girls are not
swimming or playing basketball.

Taking somewhat of a respite
from the arduous football season
ust ﬁnished and the even more
birlng banqueting session that fol-
lowed, Dr. Jock Sutherland, the
.1ation’s best coach of the na-
.ion’s best team, is planning to
;pend his holiday
ziana.

Sutherland has made arrange-
ments to attend the annual con-
fave of the National Intercol-
egiate Football Co-ach’s Associa-
.ion in New Orleans.

This meeting is scheduled for
the last few days in December.
This will enable the mentors to
stay in the balmy southwest over
New Year’s day to watch the Su-
gar Bowl game.

Dr. Sutherland also expects to
attend this post season affair be-
tween Santa Cla' a, undefeated
Paciﬁc Coast outﬁt, and Louisiana
State, reputed to be the ﬁnest
team in the South. This game is
rated as the best of the holiday

Open Letter
To Mr. Claus

Dear Santa:
E’RE almost afraid that we’re being a bit
selﬁsh this year, but we think you’ll un-
derstand when we tell you that we’ve really
been asking for these things for quite‘ some
time now.
Sometimes, Santa, we wonder if you receive
our letters . . . or if you pay any attention to
them if you do. But this year, Santa, we’re-

going to take another chance. Just to see if
you really ARE.

We want you to understand these things
when you read our letter.

First of all, since we must‘ begin somewhere,

we’d like to ask you to bring us or tell us how

we can get a nice new student union. You’ve
probably heard that we’ve asked for this al-
ready, but We’d like to remind you anyway.

You see, We want‘ a place where we can eat,
without sitting on the steps in the Cathedral
or eating in the smoke-jammed rooms on the
eighth floor or cramming our way into the
Tuck Shop. And we want something better
to eat. We ’re getting a bit tired of sandwiches
and bottled milk . . . but don ’t get us wrong;
we appreciate, the improved quality of some of‘
the food in the Tuck Shop.

Along these lines let us add that we want a
place where we can dance and hold organiza-
tion meetings. VVe think you’ll understand
that. And herc’s a tip: If you can get us a
key to Foster Memorial, we’ll defer this re-
quest for a Student Union.

And then We’d like to ask for something for
a few friends of ours. It isn’t too much to
ask, we think. We want our professors and
instructors at the University to be given a
more deﬁnite policy of faculty tenure. Some
of them get disappointed at times when they
think that their jobs are relatively insecure.
In line with that, Santa, We’d like to get
back our recognition from the American Asso-
ciation of University Professors. Lots of peo-
ple tell us that We should have that recogni-
tion. Outsiders say we’ve been black-listed,
and that‘ a lot of college people throughout
the country don ’t think so much of us now.
After that we wish you’d bring us a. muffler
t.o stop all that rumbling-grumbling in the
Athletic Ofﬁce. We consider Pitt athletics on
a par with the best in the country, and we
think that all this unfavorable publicity We’ve
been having has merely been bungled into.
And there ’s one man up there, Santa, whose
name is Dr. Sutherland. In case you haven’t
heard of him, he’s one of the best football
coaches in the country, and We’d like to know
what is happening to him. We also think he
deserves a lot more consideration from the
athletic oﬁices than he’s been getting.

There are a couple more things We’d like to
mention. We’d like to see that SFA project
known as Eugenics-Euthenics course put into
the regular university curriculum, and we’d
like to see this done before we graduate, if
that Wouldn’t be asking too much.

And that reminds us of SFA. We’d like
you, if you possibly can, to get them something
more to do. There are a lot of members there,
we hear, whom they can’t keep busy. And,
Santa, if you possibly can, please do something
to take away the pessimism that student gov-
ernments are rather useless organizations.

We ’d like to suggest that you ﬁnd out for
us about the book store. Some of our friends
from other colleges have told us that they pay
a. good bit less for their texts than we do.
Maybe you can fix that.

Finally, Santa, we want to say just this:
we’d like to know deﬁnitely about these
requests of ours and if possible, before next
Christmas.

Some of these requests are so important
to us that We’d do anything to help you
bring them to us, if you’ll only let us know
what to do.

And don’t hunt for a. chimney on the Ca.-
thedral, Santa. Come right. in by the Fifth
Avenue entrance . . we’ll waive all those
rules about delivery dovmstairs.

With the very best seasonal greetings to
you, Santa, we remain,

II Duce Watches
World’s Reaction

By ferry Hahn

Mussolini spent last Sunday and Monday reading
summaries of foreign comments on his speech, Sat-
urday, in which he renounced any tie to the League
of Nations.

Before entering into the Spanish civil war as an
ally of the rebels, I1 Duce awaits the world’s reaction
of his break with the League.

Some diplomats point out that during the last
few months, Italy has reduced her commitments in
Spain. Mussolini hoped to establish a new basis for
Italo-British friendship around the Mediterranean.

New Policy

However, several developments have caused Il
Duce to institute a new policy. The Loyalists are
“taking heart” after receiving outside help, while
the insurgents have made little progress on the
battleﬁeld for a month. Great Britain has been
strengthening her political and ﬁnancial position
with the Rebels.

After wrecking any possibilities of Anglo-Italian
understanding, as a result of his League announce-
ment, Saturday, and his cry of deﬁance to the
“democracies,” Mussolini has decided upon outright
support of Generalissimo Franco’s Insurgents.

Mussolini will refrain from a major stand in
‘spam, until he has fully considered foreign reac-
tion; especially he awaits the effect of his League
denouncement upon Great Britain and France.

Articles Violated

In reality the League of Nations is dead. Presi- ‘

dent Wilson said that the heart of the Covenant
was Articles 10 and 16. Article 10 reads: “The
members of the League undertake to respect and
preserve as against external aggression the terri-
torial integrity and political independence of all

members of the League.” Article 16 deﬁnitely de- .

clares that an act of war against one member “shall
ipso facto be deemed . . . an act of war against all
other members.”

These two articles were violated first by Japan,
then Italy, who violated the pledge not to resort to
aggression. The other signatory nations have vio-
lated their pledges by disregarding Article 16, by
doing nothing about the aggression.

Therefore, Italy is not alone in the abandoning
of the original conception of the League. Neither
have Japan and Germany. France, Russia, and
United States have abandoned it too. The United
States is one of the guiltiest. We were one of the
ﬁrst to take the lead in organization; we were one
of the ﬁrst to throw it off. We wanted peace, but
we refused to share any of the risks or do any of
the work. i

Mussolini’s move is no more than to bring pressure
upon France, Great Britain, and other powers to
get what she wants, principally full recognition for
her new Roman empire.

Intercollegiate

Barbecue

Students at the University of Colorado think that
taking a live buffalo mascot to football games would
arouse school spirit and provide a good meal after
the game. ,

Maybe they’ll roast it on the gridiron.

In Self-defense

We see by the Kentucky Kernel that the girls
down in the Blue Grass region have formed a
Spinster Club, whose theme song is “Nice Work If
You Can Get It.” The ﬂower of the group is the
lily for some obscure reason.

We remember a fable about a. fox and sour grapes.

a lot of good it did then. I’ll grant
you that that spot news I picked
up on my antennae is rather ex-
citing. But there’s no reason to

think you’re going, to settle the is-
sue with snap judgments.”

“Well,” the Queen retorted,
“we’ve got to see which way the
wind blows first. And then we’ll
get it all worked out. Really,
though, I mean to find a solution
this time. We can”: fool around
any more. Got to be decisive.” She
began walking about in a circle.
“Say,” she said, “how about re-
viewing the whole business? Then
we can start with the facts.”

“Now you’re talking, your Maj-
esty. All right, then. This is the
whole story, according to the re-
ports winded to me this morning.
It seems that a handful of our in-
ternationally-minded W 0 r k e rs
were blown up. About fifteen of
them, I think it was. They were
floating about on a tiny timothy
blade in that stream over near the
buckeye tree.”

“Darn fools,” the Queen inton-
ated.

“Fools or not, there they were,
right in the middle of one of the
regular battles between the or-
ange and brown soldiers. And then
they were blown up.” Daphne
hesitated a moment, then Went on.
“The way I heard it, it seems that
the browns were warming up on
their target practice, and, by mis-
take, they let a piece of rice puff
and explode directly in front of
our worker’s timothy blade. Seven

She leaned over to Daphne, gesticulat.ii1gwildly.
“Just you listen to me.

Daphne looked at her sister with a sneer.

   

Editor, The Pitt News:

Think . . .

L otters

The article on the ‘Nationality! Lebanon’ Syria’ is like Saying

Rooms in yesterday’s issue of The
Pitt News makes an old grad
question the modern college gen-
eration. In our, day we believed
that the privileged few with a
higher education would become
the leaders, that we had respon-
sibility to be accurate, intelligent,
and observing.

Perhaps the reporter who wrote
the article has specialized and,
therefore, skipped, geography. In
that case, I suppose it is excusa-
ble if Czechoslovakia is called a
“Balkan country.” I feel quite
certain that the English Depart-
ment—it is reads The Pitt News
—would moan over the spelling
of Yugoslav: first “Yugos1ova-
kian,” and directly below, “Yugo-
slavonian.” But what would ex-
cuse misspelling the good old
English word “adviser?”

Mr. Dodge becomes Dr. Dodge
in the next line. Did The News
staff hold an election? I see
where Dr. Dodge is president of
the Beirut Committee. On the
list given to the reporter the
chairman of the newly-formed
Committee was Professor Khawli.
Of course, this is a slight error.

American University of Beirut,

University of Pittsburgh, Penn-
sylvania, Ohio, only worse.

This is merely a mild protest
against having to spend precious
time with three different report-
ers from The Pitt News on this
one article.

Writer Says Kaltenborn
Guilty Of Chauvinism

News Reporter Accuses Radio Commentator
Of Statements Revealing Shallow Jingoism

By Clarence Wible

Mr. Henry Kaltenborn, news commentator, is quite  patriot.
When he speaks, one can almost hear

the band playing. The

Hurray for Mr. Kaltenborn, and the

In a radio broadcast immediately after the bombing of
American ships in Chinese waters, Mr.
himself to convict the Japanese of%

Kaltenborn took it upon

the bombing before he actually
knew who was responsible or the
outrage. It so happened that the
Japanese were guilty of the latest
“mistake.” But the fact still re-
mains that Mr. Kaltenborn shout-
ed “Wolf"’, before he knew just
who the wolf was. It was a neat
bit of guessing, but mighty dan-
gerous prognostication under the
circumstances.

Mr. Kaltenborn also draws fur-
ther interesting conclusions from

this recent unpleasantness. Ac-
cording to this authority, the Pa-
nay and Standard Oil Company’s
late misfortune should show clear-
ly to the people of the United
States the necessity of combining
with Great Britain in an effort to
‘protect their community of in-
terests in the East. In other and
plainer words, let’s risk another
War with Great Britain as an ally
to protect the almighty dollar and
pound. It seems that lives do not
The Standard Oil Com-

pany’s millions must be protected.

In the heat of his oratorical and
patriotic fervor, Mr. Kaltenborn
further insists that neutrality and
withdrawal of citizens and ships
from troubled areas are cowardice.
The stupidity and shallowness of
this thought is so apparent that it
merits little consideration. Let it
be sufﬁcient to say that when we
in our country are bending over
backwards in an effort to stay out
of war, and to remain free from
entanging foreign alliances, such
a statement as lVIr. Kaltenborn
has made concerning neutrality
and withdrawal is undeniably
criminal.

Driving the ﬁnal spike into his
monument to jingoism, Mr. Kal-
tenborn rids himself of this happy
thought, “Our national prestige is
so important in the world that we
should not hesitate to sacriﬁce a
few lives, if necessary, to pre-
serve it.”

I wonder if Mr. Kaltenborn has
any stock in Standard Oil?

Painting ‘The Gossip’ g

Canvas Depicts
Typical Scene
Of Pittsburgh

With the purchase last week of
“The Gossips,” a painting by
Samuel Rosenberg, prominent
Pittsburgh artist, the Faculty Club
has taken its second step in the
acquisition of a group of paintings
to hang in the club quarters on
the seventeenth ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral.

PITTSBURGH ARTIST

Prerequisite of all paintings to
be considered is that they be done
by Pittsburgh artists. Rosenberg,
whose painting “Sunday After-
noon” was exhibited in the Inter-
national exhibit this fall at Car-
negie museum has been described
as “the most indigenous of Pitts-
burgh artists.”

“The Gossips,” a typical Pitts-§
burgh scene, is the painting of a"

railroad in one of
which divide the city, Viewed
from a street of shabby homes,
probably in the Bloomfield dis-
trict. In the distance can be seen
the Oakland section of the city,
with the spire of the Cathedral
silhouetted above everything else
in the leaden sky.

ONE IVIAN SHOVV

Noted for his realistic portrayals
of Pittsburgh scenes, Rosenberg
exhibited most of his paintings
in a “one-man-show” last April at
Carnegie Institute. He first ex-
hibited “The Gossips” at the
“Paintings by Pittsburgh Artists"
show in June at the Institute.

The other local artist repre-
sented in the Faculty Club’s art
collection is Christian J. Walter,
whose “Moonlight” was acquired
some time ago. Chairman of the
Faculty Club’s Library committee
which purchased the paintings, is
Dr. A. L. Robinson, assistant pro-
fessor of chemistry.

Dr. Robinson placed on exhibit
in the Faculty Club dining room
Monday a new painting by anoth-
er local artist, Alexander Kostel-
low of Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology. ’l‘o secure comments by
