“Devanath wins
graduate election

Graduate and Professional Student Assembly
holds vote, former SGB member wins presidency

Liz Navratil
News Editor

v.When most students were still
invbed Saturday morning, P] Dil-

lon was calling some of his fellow '

graduate students. 5
For some, the early morning
call brought good news. They had
won a place on the Graduate and
Professional Student Assemb1y’s
Executive Board. For others, it
brought some disappointment.
Dillon, the assembly’s current
vice president of communications,

arrivedin the GPSA office on the I

eighth ﬂoor of the William ‘Pitt
Union shortly before 10:30 a.m.
Saturday. . . .

He also called The Pitt News,’
conferencing’ us in on his calls
to the candidates for GPSA elec-
tions, which ended at 11:59 p.m.

Friday. His calls are part of a yearly

ritual in which the outgoing GPSA
members try to call the candidates
before posting the election results
online,- where all students can see
them. ‘ "

_ “I try not to think about it,”
Dillon said of his role in the calls.
“I guess that maybe I’m crushing

_ some people’s expectations and
then exciting otherpeople. I think
that’s just what’I have to do.”

Dillon’s ﬁrst callwas to Nila
Devanath, an undergraduate se-
niorand former Student Govern-
ment Board member who plans to

attend Pitt’s School of Medicine
next year. ‘

“You know why I’m calling,”
Dillon said. “I’m saying.congrat—
ulations. You are our new GPSA,
president.” . .

Devanath gasped for a moment.

“Qh my God, that’s awesome.-

Thank you,” she said.

The Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly is in charge of
administering half of the graduate
and professional students’ activity

' fee to provide programs for grad-

uate and professional students,
much like Student Government

Board oversees the undergraduate V

students’ activities fee. The presi-

dent oversees the vice presidents

and serves as a student represen-
tative,. delivering reports to the
University Senate and setting the
agenda for the year.

Devanath received 275 votes, _

whereas Dustin ‘McDaniel, a stu-

If dent in the law school and Gradu-

ate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs, received 159 and
candidate Joseph Pleso, who is

studying math in the School of

Arts and Sciences, received 53.
About 600 students voted in the
election, which was open to about
10,000 graduate and professional

. students. This turnout issimilar‘

to last year’s.

Within 20 minutes of Dillon’s
phone call, Devanath’s Facebook
status read, “can’t wait to get start-
ed learning the ropes of GPSA.”

Michael Macagnone

Senior Staff Writer .

Pitt wants you to <3 your computer.

Computing Services and Systems Develop-

planners focused the event on ‘safe computing,

Love Your Computer Week became LoveYour

Jinx Walton, Vice Chancellor and director of
CSSD, helped to plan this year’s Love Your Com-

department changed the event schedule to last
more than one week to accommodate more stu-
dents’ schedules.

questioned CSSD’s change of date. -

Elections 4 1

A day later, McDaniel and Pleso were
asking current GPSA members to clarify
the assembly’s bylaws, asking whether
Devanath was truly eligible to run for the
presidency because she is still an under-
graduate student.

~ Looking at the bylaws

The bylaws say that any graduate or
professional student who ﬁles a position
statement with the assembly by the required
deadline may run for office. They deﬁne
graduate and professional students as those
who are “currently, enrolled in a graduate-
level program and paying the graduate stu-
dent activity fee.’’ ‘ -

“What I want to ﬁnd out,” McDaniel said,
“is what the thinking about this is, Whether
it fell through the cracks or whether I’m
missing something. It appears to me as

__ though the GPSA bylaws would make Ms.
' Deva‘nath’s candidacy void, but I’m not sure

about that.”

David Givens, who heads the assembly’s
elections committee, said the elections com-
mittee met in January, before it had candi-
dates, to discuss its bylaws. After consulting
with the Provost’s Ofﬁce, the committee

their terms could run for GPSA election.
“We wanted as many people who‘ to be

said. “We. wanted to. make sure that we

Givens said he thinks the elections com-

Pleso in person to discuss their concerns.

said.

As of Saturday morning Dillon had no
idea this controversy would occur. His larg-
est problem with the elections was trying to
get in touch with the candidates.

The wake-up calls

When he ﬁnished his call to Devanath,
he called Melanie Rodrigues, who attends
Pitt’s medical school. Rodrigues ran unop-
posed for vice president of committees,
who is responsible for managing the gradu-
ate students’ representation on external
groups, such as the University Senate and
Board ofTrustees. I

“This is a formality, I guess,” Dillon
said. . '

Rodrigues didn’t pick up.

Dillon moved on.

“Next is Qing Hu, who won vice presi-
dent of communications,” Dillon said. “I’l1

In digital age, libraries should try and diversify

n the digital age, the future of the

written (and printed) word re-

mains shaky at best. And because
so much information is a mere click
away, the institution of the library in
its traditional role grows increasingly
obsolete.

Libraries have seen tough ﬁnancial
times. Take‘ the Carnegie Library of
Pittsburgh, for example. Last year,
the institution had to consider closing
four of its branches and merging two
others, according to the Pittsburgh
Post— Gazette. Pittsburgh’s'City Coun-
cil voted to grant the library system
$600,000 to help keepthe institution
aﬂoat and prevent closings. The plight
isn’t characteristic exclusively to the

Libraries shouldn’t have to keep
scrapingby on budget bailouts. Part of
their ability to stay relevant relies on
constantly updating their digital re--
sources. But is there another way?

Libraries both in the Pittsburgh
area and throughout the country have
begun lending some rather nontradi-
tional items. ' '

AlibraryinBaldwin Borough lends
marmequins for practicing CPR, the

The sarcasmwas searing, chronic, an-

Another essay talked about racial

Libraries are commonly regarded
as centers ofknowledge, and most of
that knowledge lies in their printed
resources. By no means should librar-
ies considerbooks and other printed
materials as secondary products in
their inventory — at least not at this
point — but bringing in other prod-
ucts could supplement their own
educational qualities. , .

importantly, is there not avalue in the

through which he learns‘.’

of course, often considered the oppo-

But video games are hardly tl1e most .

nontraditional products: A Califomia

- Even if the library attracts patrons

with an atypical inventory, there’s also
the possibility that it will lead to fur-

this case, rediscoveringwhat libraries

traditionally offer.

DJ artist mixes mash-

ups and‘ Lights’

DJ and producer Pretty Lights to bring Girl Talk—type mash—ups to Mr. Small’s Theatre.

Liz Keeney
Staff Writer

Depending on whom you ask, many
people will agree that in contempo-
rary music, any style that an artist
could take on to perform has been
nearly exhausted in terms of cre-
ative opportunity. When DJ and
producer Pretty Lights wanted to

do something new and progressive‘

with his music, he decided to look

Pretty Lights

to the past.

Pretty Lights, also known as
Derek Vincent Smith, is part of a
new movement in music known as
digital sampling, popularized by
artists like Aphrodite and Girl Talk.
It’s a way of making music by tak-
ing samples of popular and familiar

songs and juxtaposing them with

original beats and melodies. The
result is an experimental mix of
the past, present and future, that,
though maybe not to everyone’s
exact taste, is an intriguing and
developing genre.

Smith will perform on Tuesday,
April 6, at Mr. Small’s Theatre in a
show that will give listeners a taste
of this new genre.

Each sampler has his own style,
whether it is the loud, fast dance
hall of Girl Talk or the-hardcore
“jungle” style of Aphrodite —— and
Pretty Lights is no exception. Clas-

MOVIE ANALYSIS  

 

U.S. ratingssystem prefersviolence over sex

Andy Tybout
Columnist

This week in theaters, the violent

monster bash “Clash of the Titans” ,

has been deemed acceptable for
teenagers aged 13 and older. But
if kids under the age of 17 want to
check out the blatantly silly “Hot
Tub Time Machine,” they’ll have to
bring a parent or guardian —— the
ﬁlm is rated R.

It’s a well—established Holly-
wood double standard that a ﬁlm
can gorge itself on blood and guts
and remain suitable for young
teens, but drop more than one f-
bomb or show something more
than cleavage and it’ll be banished

to the morally bankrupt junkyard‘
of R or, in some extreme cases, »

NC-17.
It’s a ratings system unique to

American audiences, and one glee-
fully deconstructed in the 2006
documentary, “This Film is Not Yet
Rated.” In the movie, the Motion
Picture Association of America,
which oversees all American ﬁlm
ratings, is portrayed as an almost
cultish organization — an anony-
mous squadron of moral crusad-
ers bickering behind closed doors
which ﬁlms are worthy or unwor-
thy of a mainstream audience’s
attention. '

The board members, according
to the ﬁlm, are mostly older par-
ents. Their standards of evaluation,
or lack thereof, are kept secret.
Their suggestions for cuts, should
a ﬁlm be deemed too inappropriate
for a mainstream audience, often
undermine a ﬁlm’s most powerful
scenes — usually sex scenes.

From both an intellectual and
evolutionary standpoint, this

seems ridiculous. In most instanc-
es, sex is good and violence is bad.
But for the MPAA, this truism is
inverted. Sex becomes obscene,

while violence is accepted as com- »

monplace.

In spite of this, parents from
sea to shining sea take the current
rating system seriously. It took the
best of my fourth grade coaxing
abilities, for instance, to get my
parent’s permission to see the PG-
13 “Doctor Dolittle” (apparently
Eddie Murphy doesn’t tone down
his language for the animals).

Not to sound like a snob, but

Europe, that land of old churches
and Smart cars, has devised better
systems. The British Board of Film
Classiﬁcation, for example, ranks
ﬁlms based on their potential for,
“desensitizing a potential viewer
to the effects of violence, degrad-
ing a potential viewer’s sense of

' empathy, encouraging a dehuman-
ized view of others, suppressing
pro—social attitudes, encouraging
anti-social attitudes, reinforcing
unhealthy fantasies, or eroding a
sense of moral responsibility.”

Sounds a bit puritanical, but
their hearts are in the right place
-— the objectis to protect children
fromtlesensitization, particularly

' from desensitization of violence.
Which is how these ratings should
go: “the ‘birds and the bees” talk is
inevitable, butlthe “violence is a‘
part of life” talk should hopefully
be avoided. ‘ » , . .

If I were king of Hollywood
(and I’m working on it), theratings
would go as follows: give G ratings

to movies that couldn’t possibly"

damage a child’s psyche;(aka 90
percent of all G and PG movies), PG
to movies with a couple.f3‘bombs
and cases of slight nud

 

(because PG-13 seems too arbi-
trary) to movies with nudity, sex
and/or some — not excessive ——
violence, and ﬁnally, R to movies
with violence strong enough to en-
gender, in the words of the BBFC, a
“dehumanized-View of others.” '

This isn’t to say that Violence

' is inherently corrosive. The list
of blood—drenched classics is long ‘

enough to‘ﬁll plenty of movie col-
umns, and when examined with
maturity, ﬁlmic violence can teach

. us valuable lessons. It’s just that

onscreen gore seems much more
capable of inﬂicting mental or
emotional harmthan onscreen
sex does. ‘

Don’t get me. wrong, I’m not
suggesting that kids forgo “How
to Train Your Dragon” in favor of
“Hot Tub Time Machine,” but it’s

a if the battleﬁeld, not the bedroom,

that’s most likely to leave a scar.

Smith credits hismusical sensibilities in
part to growing up in the Midwest —+ Fort

“Basically, growing up in the middle of
the country in a small city in Colorado ex-
posed me to a bunch bf different scenes and
styles of music that all inﬂuenced me in one
way or another, and helped me develop the
current vision and sound of Pretty Ligh ,”

y Lights’ music ‘fresh’

According to Smith, the music scene in
Colorado gave him the chance to gethis foot
in the door to themusic industry.

‘ “I think it wasla cool place to grow up and .

develop a musical sensibility because I was
exposed to so many scenes and genres,” he
said. “I started _going to shows and playing

in bands when the punk scene was really _

popping off.”

‘When Smith was in high school and
college, the underground hip-hop scene
emerged in Colorado, and he had a chance
to see and even open for every hip—hop act
that came through to town, Smith said.
Sometimes they even partied at his house
after the show. i

“I remember slap boxing Murs in,my
backyard after a Living Legends show,” he
said. “I also remember kicking it with Aesop
Rock on the rocking chair on my front porch

_ until about 5:30 a.m.” When writing songs,

Smith samples many different artists, such

' as Wu—Tang Clan, Bonobo, Nate Dogg, Nina 4

Simone, DJ Shadow and Pink Floyd. In fact,
the name Pretty Lights stems from a poster
advertising a Pink Floyd concert and laser
show. However, Smith’s formula for picking
a sample "is tightly under wraps. '

“It depends what I’m looking for. I’ve de— V

iveloped a process that I use, but 'that’s super
top secret,” he explained. “Sometimes I start
with my Fender Rhodes and my synthesiz-

ers, sometimes I start with a fresh old vinyl .

sample, and then I build off that.” ,
Anotherimportant aspect of Pretty

Lights is the, live performance. Teaming

up with drummer Cory Eberhard, Pretty

. Lights’-shows apparently live up to its name.
I Coupled with loud music and stunning visu-

als, a Pretty Lights show is what Smith calls,
“interpretations of the album tracks with a
lot of other special unreleased tracks and
remixes.”

For now, Smith plans on keeping busy
by continuing to tour, as well as turning his
company Pretty Lights Music into a “new
style” record label. ' .

“I just want to continue making and re_—
leasing fresh music,” he said, “and continue
pushing the boundariesof ‘fresh.’”

TRACK AND FIELD

Pitt performs strong

Two pant-hers‘ qualify for IC4A Outdoor Championships.

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

The Pitt track and ﬁeld team had

some catching up to do.
“Essentially, this was our

ﬁrst outdoor meet,” Head Coach

Alonzo Webb said, of the Duke‘

Invitational, which was held over -
the weekend. “Some of the other
T tearns have been in three or four

competitions so far.”_' _

Despite this lack of exposure
to outdoor competition, Webb
noted that he was pleased with
the level of performance given
by both the men’s and women’s
teams.

“For a ﬁrst meet,'I saw a lot of
positive things that we can build
on as the season progresses,”
Webb said. “Overall, I would say
we were very competitive.”

_ Friday was the ﬁrst day of the

competition, and junior Teddy .

‘Miller and sophomore Folarin
Ijelu both qualiﬁed for the IC4A

. Outdoor Championships, which

take place in May.

Miller placed second in the
1o,o0o—meter run'by ﬁnishing
in 30 -minutes, 55.22 seconds
whereas Ijelu took second place
in the triple jump with a leap of
14.80 meters.

In addition, several other-

members of the men’s team earned
spots in the Big East champion-
ships based on their performance
at the Duke Invitational. '

NCAA should reseed

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ" Writer

As my Pittsburgh friend told me last week, “The
bracket needs tweaked.” _
Rumors have swirled recently about the

NCAA Tournament expanding to 96 teams. r

Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany said last
week that expansion for the 2011 Tournament
is “probable,” and The Pitt News’ Randy Lie-
berman recently wrote on the pros and cons
of such a change. ’

But I’m not here to talk about something
as drastic as expansion. I’m here to talk about
reseeding. ’

In a playoff structure that reseeds after

_ each round, the advancing teams are sorte_d

by their rank, and the highest seed plays the
lowest remaining seed, the second seed plays
the penultimate seed, and so on. .

The NHL, MLB and NFL all reseedaflzer each
playoff round. The NBA, meanwhile, does not,
and its system -— in which division winners
are de facto guaranteed no higher than a No. 5
seed, among other wacky features —— has been
criticized since it was instituted in 2006. -

Of course, the NCAA Tournament does not
reseed. After all,”that’s why bracket pools are
possible. .“~ -

The Tournament bracket nonetheless is set
up to function like reseeding if there are no
upsets. A No. 1 seed would play the No. 8, then
the No. 4 and then the No. 2. _

Upsets, though, ruin everything.

Check out Michigan State’s run to the Final
Four. The No. 5 Spartans played No. 4seed Mary-

land in the second round, but then played No. 9 -

seed Northern Iowa in the Sweet 16 because of
the _Panthers’ upset of Kansas. Tennessee’s win
over No. 2 Kansas State then set up an Elite Eight
battle between a No. 5 and a No. 6. _

- Had the Tournament reseeded, the Spartans
and the Volunteers would still have played — but
in the second round.

Though everyone loves a good upset, Michi-

gan State—Tennessee doesn’t sound like a mar-
quee rnatchup for-atrip to Indianapolis. In fact,
New York Daily News columnist Dick Weiss
wrote, “Thank heaven the_ Duke Blue Devils are
in the Final Four,” because without them the

Toumament’s conclusion would be atelevision

ratings disaster.

For proof on the need for reseeding, look
no ﬁirther than the Final Four itself. On one
side of the bracket, two of the top ﬁve teams in
the country battled. On the other side, two N o.
5 seeds played.

In a reseeded Tournament, Duke would
have played Butler, and West Virginia would
have played Michigan State. Duke—“West Vir-
ginia would have been a championship game
scenario. . T .

Reseeding helps provide the best matchups
between the best teams. Across sports, it’s all
aboutthe bignames. Since 2001,-the ﬁve World

. ' Series thathadthe Yankees orRed Soxinit drew

the ﬁve highest television ratings, and there’s a
reason NBC schedules Pittsburgh and Washing-
ton in its hockey coverage so often. .

’ In areseeded world, Kansas plays No. 14 seed

‘ Ohio and Northern Iowa plays Maryland.

Butthanks to the bracket, Ohio had the easi-

~ est second—round opponent of any underdog.

If a team wants a Tournament bid, it might

as wéll wish for low seed. It means an easier

second—round opponent should it get by the
ﬁrst round. ‘ .

Look at the South region of this year’s Tour-
namcnt. Because of upsets all around them,
Baylor made the Elite Eight without playing a
single-digit seed. ,

And reseeding doesn’truinthe possibility of
aCinderella— it just weeds out ﬂukes. Take the
Butler Bulldogs, adeservingFinal Four surprise.
The Bulldogs beat the top two seeds in the West,
although thanks to the brackefs setup they did
it in backward order. .

' Ifthe Tournament reseeded, every underdog
would have to takethis route. Forperspective, in
2006, George Mason’s easiest opponentwas in
the Sweet 16, when the Patriots faced No. 7 seed

qualiﬁying times.

“Cowsette performed very well,” Webb
said. “I was impressed with his qualify-
ing times, especially in the early start of
the season, I look forward to seeing his
improvement as well.”

The women’s team was also successful
at the meet and came away with multiple
Eastern College Athletic Conference and
Big East championship qualifying perfor-
mances.

Three such performances- also earned
first place at the invitational: senior Ka.et-
lyn Brown won the 400 dash finishing with
55.99, the relay team won in the 4X100
event with 46.41 and senior Brianna Broyles
won the'40o hurdles ﬁnishing with a, time
of 1:00.82.

The relay team consisted of freshman
Ashley Woodford, junior Da’Lynn Mills,
Broyles and sophomore Cambryajones.

“This relay team was strong,” Webb said.
“The first place finish and ECAC qualifica-
tion shows just how well the team is capable
of competing.”

-Webb also notedlthat Mills was worthy
of recognition for her 12.05 performance in
the 100 dash and 23.86 in the 200 dash.

‘EMills qualified for the ECAC in both
events and earned her personal best times
in those races,” Webb said. “It’s great to win
a race, but competing against yourself and
your times is just as important.” ’

Once again, the ﬁeld team succeeded in

surprising Webb. -. , V

“The women’s ﬁeld team was exceptional
at this meet,” Webb said. “Sarah Anderson
was especially dominant this weekend.”

Anderson, a junior, placed fourth in the
discus throw and earned a spot in the ECAC
Championship with a distance of 43.36
meters. ' _

Pitt’s dominance continued in the ham~
mer throw a_s Anderson’s third -place ﬁnish
(51.26) was joined by sophomore Kayla
Comrie’s eighth place performance (47.53)

~ and sophomore Robin Gilmore’s 11th place

throw (45.53). I
All three.members garnered Big East

championship marks for their perfor-

mances. - '

Webb knows that while his team com-,

peted at a high level, there is always room to
improve and prepare for the next meet. »
“At this meet, it was important to as-

sess where the teamlwas at, competitively }
speaking,” Webb said. “Now that the team ‘ '

has had the ﬁrst taste of the outdoor sea-
son, we can look to work on our weaknesses

"and come out withan even better perfor- _

mance at the next meet.” .

The men’s and women’s teams will both _

be split into squadsjthat will compete at the

Arizona St. Sun Angel Classic and the Buck- ,

nelllnvitational on_Friday and Saturday.

 

Reseeding will avoid flukes

Reseeding < 12

Wichita State. That doesn’t make sense.

The obstacles to the plan are obvious. First,
there’s the travel issue. The Tournament breaks
down each region into four locations. No reseed-
ed team wants to win in Milwaukee only to learn
it has to bus to Buffalo to play its second-round
game. The solution to this is simple, though:

one host city for each region’s ﬁrst two rounds.

Make itabig deal. _

Second, the NCAA can opt out of its cur—
rent contract with CBS after this year. If that
happens, ESPN will snatch up the Tournament

-— the one event it currently must talk about
against its marketing will — and persuade the
NCAA to expand to another round of revenue-
generating nationally televised Tournament
games, bracket intact. V

Third, when asked by USA Today about re-

" seeding, former NCAA committee chairman

Mike Slive said it won’t happen.

“I’m comfortable with the way it is,” he said.
“I don’t think tinkering is in the best interest
[of the event].” ' r

But they’re willingtoexpand.
