CHARTER DAY

To-day the University celebrates the
one hundred and twenty-sixth anniver-
sary of the granting of the charter to
the old Pittsburgh Academy, out of
which grew the present University of
Pittsburgh. In 1787 the Pittsburgh
Academy represente\d the highest place
of learning in the city, to-day _the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh holds -‘the same
high place in the educational life of the
city that the Academy held ‘in those
days. Pitt represents the highest seat
of classical learning in the city at the.
present‘ time. It offers to its students

Va variety of courses that’ cannot be

given. at institutionsthat specialize to
a large degree. It is the aim and the
desire of the University to grow as
the city grows, and to be able to sup-
_.ply-the demands of the city along edu-
cational lines.‘ . . -

-It is interesting to note the develop-
ment of the institution from the time
of its birth and to contract the condi-
tions at that_ timevvith those of the
present. When the charter of the Pitts-
b}1rgh Academy was granted to that in-
stitution Febrpary 28,_ 1787,Vthere. were
not as many people in the entire ‘Pitts-
burgh district as are now enrolled in
the department: of the University. In
the City of
Pittsburgh was only. 1,565, whilemthe en-
rollment of the University February 1
of the present year was 2,489, not in-
cluding over 100‘; "non-resident students.
In the year 1820, one year after the
granting of ‘the charter of t~he.Western
University of Pennsylvania, which pro-
vided forta much larger curriculum
than the old Academy, the population of
the city was but 7,248. '

The first class that graduated from
the Western-University of Pennsylvania
consisted of -only three persons-3.11
preachers, Thomas C. Guthrie, who re-
ceived t'he degree of Doctor of Divinity
from Franklin College, Rev. Alexander
Logan and Rev. Samuel Ferguson. The-

’ graduating class of t-he present year

\from the University -of -Pittsburgli will
have a membership of several hundred,
representatives of all ‘the departments
of the University- ,
From time to time as there was. de-

‘mand for certain additions to the cur-

riculum, they were' ma-de; and thus the
University kept pace with the demand of

the city. One feature in- all the charters
granted to the University has been
prominent,” and that is 1iber9».1I1eSS~

There was never , any discrimination
made in the student body as to creed
or color, while the faculty was selected
from men of teaching ability and high.
moral character. - '- .

Dr. S. B. McCormick, the present
chancellor of the University, was elected
to officein May, 1904. Since that time
-the University has made more rapid
progress, perhaps, than in any other
period of its history. In 1908 the name
‘of the institution was ‘changed from
that of” the Western University of-
Pennsylvania, to the University of Pitts-
burgh. Four ‘uildings of the proposed
group have been erected on the hillside
overlooking the Schenley Park district
and it is expected that several others
will be put up in the near future. The
City of Pittsburgh is growing and as
the city“ grows so is the University
growing and expanding, in order that it
may meet the’ demands that are placed

 

BURY THE. HATCHET

Now that the new league has been
formed with Pitt, w. & J. -and West
Virginia as the_char~ter.members, _Pitt
and our old rivals in Washington—the
Red and Black——sxhould bury the ‘hatchet
-once and for all. :There is‘plenty of
ro-om in this part of the'State for the
University of Pittsburgh and Washing-‘
ton and Jefferson. Each institution has
a great amount of work to do in its.
own sphere. Many have been the hard
fought games that have been played .on

the ‘gridiron and ‘on the diamond be-

resent Pitt, and this would be

tween teams that represented these two
institutions. Members of - both (teams
have always displayed a high ‘degree of
sportsmanship and any mudslinging
that has been done in the past has been
done on account of -the great rivalry
that existed between the students of the
two institutions and most of "the things
that have been said by the press of
either institution or by t-he students has
been said in a burst of temper. The
peop e that have been slinging the most
mud in the last few years are, most
likely, men that in their best moments
would not think of knocking a rival
college.

Let the watchwords of the .new league
be peace and good fellowship, the motto
willingness to see the good that is in
the other fellow and to overlook the
rough spots if there be any. There is
never any-thing much to be gained by
any institution by everlastingly having a
bitter feeling’ against another _ institu-
tion because they happen to be rivals in
football or some -other sport. It is far
better for every one to get together
and help each other, and -this is exactly
what themembers of the new league
have pledged themselves to do. ’

Much credit is due Mr. A. R. Hamil-
ton for the formation of the new league.
He brought the matter up and carried
it to a successful ﬁnish. This is but
another of the good things‘ that Mr.
Hamilton has d-one for the University
of Pitts-burgh. _ A -

DEBATING

Is debating given the proper emphasis
at the University is -a question that is
holding the attenti-on of many of the
students at the present time. It is only
two weeks until the intercollegiate de-
bates take place at Pitt and as yet
there has not been much interest mani-
fested eitheribly the University author-
ities or ‘the students in this ‘great event.
The debaters have entered 5' complaint
that there is -a basket ball game sched-
uled.for that night and that this fact
will do a.great deal to keep down the
crowd A at {the debate. Surely there
should be some ‘plan worked from year
to year whereby there would be no pos-
sible chance for a basket ball game to
conﬂict with the debaters. Debating’ is

.as'important to the University as any
other student activity and should be

given a fair show. At the .universi;tie~s
of the east,. great emphasis is put on
debate and capacity crowds turn out to
the debates. .

If possible the basket ball game that
is scheduled for the night of the debate
should be postponed to another time by

‘the management, or if this is not pos-

sible, step-s should be taken at /bnce to
see that a conﬂict nev_er happens again.

‘Debating must be given the proper en-

couragement at the University or soon
there will be no debating teams to rep-
great
disgrace to ‘the University.

Pitt Quarterback Takes Firsts
in S80-Yard Dash and Quarter
’M.ile—Re1ay Team Beats Op‘-

'ponents in Easy Sty1e—Can-
«didates Show Effect of Good

' Training. 8 ' g

The Gold and Blue track team made
a splendid showing at the bigmeet held
by the Y. M. C. A. last Saturday night
3 The Pitt athletes won
three ﬂrsts and one second place, scor-

' ing points in four out of seven events .
‘entered. oi  r ,
' . The 80-yard dash, handicap, proved

one ofthe most. exciting events of the
evening, as Liprpincott, of Olympic
fame; '-Carroll, the A. A. U. junior cham-
pion, and the cream of local college and
were

making in all some 50 competitors.

Harry Shof, the probable chauffeur of

Pitt football destinies next fall, brought
credit to the Gold, and Blue team by

‘ winning this event in handy style. He
' was given a four-yard handicap in the

sprint,.which aided him considerably in

‘taking over his speedy opponents. Shof

won his trial heat in 8 2-5 seconds, was
second in the semi-ﬁnal to Lippinco_t't
(scratch man) in ‘8 1-5 seconds, and In
the ﬁnal won from Lippinc-o.tt, Repper
and Carroll in 8 1-5 after the Olympic
st-ar had been set hack twice for break-
gl ' ‘ - .

The college‘ relay brought cheers from
the. large crowd, but‘ it was not as
thrilling as usual, owing to.Pi-tt’s big
lead throughout the‘distance._Matt M-ar-
shall ‘ran first for Pitt, and took a. lead

of at least 20 yards. He gave a splendid

exhivbiti-on, and will be a mainstay in
the half -and quarter to the Gold and
Blue“team. Considering the size of the
indoor track, his time, 52 4-5 seconds,

.was very. good, an-d Matt should run

the half in less than two minutes and
the quarter in close to 51 later in the
season. “Red” McDonald ran the next"
quarter and did even better than was
expected of him, as he equalled Ma-tt’s
time an-d- gained considerable distance
over the second man.’ This was “Red’s”
ﬁrst quarter mile dash as he‘-has always
entered the sprints and from his per-
formance‘ he will be hard to oust from
the relay: team that goes to the Penn
games in April. McKinney ran third

and didn’t let out as he seemed to be

saving for a later event. He ﬁnished
about -15. yards ahead of. his nearest
competitor. .Wal1-ace Thomas ran last
and was inst_ructed to l-oaf as-much as
Had the last two men run
their best race, Pitt would have estab-

‘ lishe-d a new Western Pennsylvania in-

door re ord, as the time’. was 3:37 3-5
with two men loaﬁng. Tech earned a

poor second and Indiana ‘Normal beat-

 & J. out for third place.

Shof,,who won the' 80, also took over
the. quarter. in 53 2-5 ‘ seconds. No
scratch man showed up, and all com-
petitors started from the 25 and 35-
yard line; Shof from the former.
m-ost pleasing part of his performan_ce

' was the heady work he did in passing

his cornpe-titons son the back stretch.
From the showing Shofmade in this
meet, we know he is good but jus-t how
good is hard to determine. He showed
c-onsiderable speedzin _the dash and fair.
stamina in the quarter, considering the
fact that he had run three he-ats "pre-
viously_ in the 80.
however, is not the 100-yard by any"
means, ‘and it is a fact that most of the
short dashes are won invthe last 10 or
20 ‘yards. ‘Also outdoor and indoor con-

.ditions,are very different and often a
’.-star outdoor man doesn't show ‘much

indoors and vice versa. Shof’s destines
lie with Shof——if. he trains hard he. may
be a collegiate star; if he loafs between

. times he will neverpass ‘the mediocre or

average stage. The day has ‘come when
only hard, consistent training‘ will earn

collegiate c-ompettti-on, he must con-

_,_ O.'_____‘____, .

‘Baseball Manager R. E. Grove, ’14,
has at last completed. his schedule and
sent i-t,in for publication. The high
calibre of—the teams onithe card show
the rapid advance of the national game
in. the University.’ Manager Grove has
done particularly well in arranging his
schedule, as several of the local col-

leges were affiliated until recently with

a league which practically barred its
members from competing with Pitt
team. This league is now broken up
and several open dates may be ﬁlled by‘
the former members if ‘they will consent
to play under the rules of the Triangu-
lar Intercolegiate Association.

The varsity baseball team had" a very
unsuccessful season last spring, due to
its reorganization, but with a good dia-
mond for practice, a good coach and a
-wealth of material, Pint should. make a
better showing this year. .“Tom” Mc-
Cree.', the former National League
player, who coached‘ the Pitt nine in
1912, -will not be a candidate for the
coachship again, as his position with
the American Sheet and Tin'Plate Com-
pany demands all his spare time.
Creery was up against a hard proposi-
tion last year, but did everything pos-
sible to put a good team on the ﬁeld. ,

The ﬁrst game of the season will be
played h Allegheny College at.Mead-
ville on April 19, and the ‘nine will
then meet a team composed of Pitt
Alumni at Trees’ Stadium to open the
local collegiate season. The card then
calls for a long western trip i.nto Ohio,

West Virginia and Michigan, for games -

with Bethany, Muskingum, Ohio‘ North-
ern, University of Michigan, and Mt.
Union. The six gamesto be played on
this trip will prove hard for the Pi-tt
nine as the season will be young. and
"the opponents of high calibre. Michigan
appears on our schedule ‘for the ﬁrst
time and this game should prove an
opening, wedge in all lines of athletic
.competition between Michigan and Pitts-

burgh. The ﬁve other teams on; the trip!

have been met before in baseball, basket
ball or football.

Return games will be played with
Bethany and Mt. Unionat Pittsburgh

early in May, and the nine will leave,

for Morgantown for two games with W.
Va. U. Pitt will then stackup against
W. & J.‘a.t Washington and then on
the-home ﬁeld for the championship of
VVestern Pennsylvania. The Red and
Black took both contests last year, but
.Pitt has a fine chance of retrieving her
standing next spring. '. ‘

Trees’ Stadium will be the scene of-

the following three games with Muskin-
gum, Bellefonte and "Allegheny late in
May, and a..few days later W. Va. Wes-
leyan will appear there for_ a: return
game. Pitt will take a trip into East-
ern Pennsylvania during the early part
of June, meeting successively Bellefonte
and Penn State, and will return to Pitts-

burgh to close the season with W. ,Va. .

University at Tree-s’ Stadium.

Manager‘ Grove had an
Barney Dreyfussf to match the Pirates
and Pitt, but the only date offered by
the baseball magnate conflicted with a
scheduled game, so
to decline the offer.‘ .

A call for battery candidates to re-
port at Trees’ Gym to-morrvow at 2 P.
M. has been issued by the manager.
The varsity men of last year» will elect
a captain at this time. -

BASEBALL IN SIGHT

 

Itwill not be long now until a call
will -be issued for baseball men. N0
deﬁnite date has been set as yet for
the ﬁrst call for candidates, but «it is
certain that the event is not far dis-
tant. It is altogether likely that Pitt
will have the fastest and best baseball
team this year .that it ever had. Man-
ager Grove is ‘planning to play some
of the best college and university
teams in this section of the country.

Last season was a very poor one
But there were »many things
that made it hard for a good team to
be developed. The new gymnasium
was not completed, so there ‘was no
chance for the battery candidates to
work out indoors for some time ‘be-
fore regular outdoor‘ practice "W.-an
started. Another great handicap to
the men was the fact that they had no
place to practice. One day they would
travel to the South Side for ‘practice
and the next "afternoon they would
be away out in the East End. They
went on their ﬁrst trip with hardly
any practice, and, d course,~made a
poor showing. However,~towardS the
last ofvthe season Pitt started to «play
real ball and defeated several teams
that hadqwon easily from them earlier

_ in the season. Itwas found*that there

was some real baseball material in the
University.

This season the players will be able
to have the gymnasium to practice In

' when the weather is bad, .and, further-
more, Pitt will have their own ibase-.

ball ﬁeld, so that the men will not
have to run all over the city tO,prac—
ticef Keeptyour eye on the Pitt nine
this season.
