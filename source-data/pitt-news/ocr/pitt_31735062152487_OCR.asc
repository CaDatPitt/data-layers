Elections Of Women’s
Organizations Set For

Next Wednesday

All major women’s organizations
on campus will take place Wednes-
day, April 8, in Alumni Hall, from
9:30 to 3:30. Oﬂicers. for nine or-
ganizations will be elected. Seventy
women will be voted upon.

Each voter will receive a printed
ballot containing the names of all
the nominees. Lists of members eli-
gible to..vote‘wil1 be kept at the vot-
ing tables. Every woman is eligi-
ble to vote for W. S. G. A., but only
members of the ‘other associations,
such as W. A. A., Panhellenic, Glee
Club and the various classes, can
vote for their respective nominees.

Senior Court will count the votes
and the results will be announced
Friday, April 10, in the Pitt Weekly.

The successful‘ candidate, along
with) Margaret Hall, Ed. ’31, pres-
ent head of - W. S. G. A., will at-
tend -a....eonvention -at..A.nn Arbor,
Mich., on April 24.

Installation of new officers will
take place May 7, Thursday noon,
at the Heinz House.

Seeing a. need for bringing the
constitution of W. S. G. A. up to
date, the organization has revised
the articles in seven places. These
changes are connected solely with
the methods of organizing W. S. G.

The ﬁrst change made is that of
adding to the executive board of the
W. S. GVA. commission a publicity
re resentative who shall automati-
sally be the women’s editor of the
Pitt Weekly. This change is a mat-
ter of convenience and safety. The
women’s editor has quicker access

to the press, and second-hand infor-

mation will be done away with.

Since there will be no Student
Council, the woman representative
to it has been eliminated.

The vice .president’s duties have
been cut down to the ordinary du-
ties. Formerly, the vice president
had’ charge of publicity. Special du-
ties may be assigned by the organ-
ization committee. . ‘

That Senior Court shall work in
conjunction with customs committee
important change. Senior
Court will have a representative at
every customs committee meeting.

Nominations for W. S. G. A. o_fﬁ-
cers, which are made by_ Senior
Court and one faculty adviser, are
to be delayed three weeks. The time
for nominations to go to the execu-
tive committee, heretofore, was on
the ﬁrst executive meeting in
March. The time is changed to the
second meeting. This gives Senior
Court three extra weeks to work on
nominations. ,?

Another change is the combining
of the decorations and property com-
mittees into one committee.

The last revision is that all com-
mittees shall be approved by the ex-
ecutive ‘board, including customs
committee.

Harrison and Sutherland
Praise Rockne

The unexpected death of Knute '

Rockne, Notre Dame football
coach, yesterday brought forth
words of tribute for the deceased
man from W. Don Harrison, di-
rector of athletics at Pitt, and
Jock Sutherland, viirsity football
coach.

“The death of Knute Rockne is
a blow to the world in general,”
commented Harrison. “He was
one of the greatest ﬁgures in the
country, and I, for one. feel his
passing keenly.”

Jock Sutherland was stunned by
the termination of his fi_-iend’s
career. “It is unbelievable; I can
hardly bear to think of it,” he la-
mented.

“Rockne was one of the greatest
friends football ever had. a man
whose place it will be impossible
to ﬁll. There has never been a
ﬁner leader or a truer sportsman.

“He helped build his boys into
the kind of men we all admire,
and as proof of that one only
needs to look at the quality and
calibre of teams he produced.”

MSGA Vote Practices
Broke Council Rule,
Asserts F ishkin

By EMANUEL FISHKIN
Head of MSGA Committee

To culminate a year of active
work a committee, composed of
representative studenots from
every campus school and every
major group. of activities,
drafted and adopted a much-
needed constitution for men’s
student ‘government; and I, as
chairman of that committee, do
not intend to see all that effort
wasted because of _ illegal and -
improper election tactics.

In the ﬁrst place the voting

for a long time an atrocious
practice was in this case a..di-
rect_.v.i9lat.ion of the .v9.tin;S.1>.r94._
ceedure established at a special
council meeting held on March
19.. If these illegally cast bal-
lots had been kept separate, in
accordance with the agreement .
of the elections committee to
keep the votes cast in each poll-
ing place separate and distinct,
. they could have _ been discarded
without injuring the validity -of
the ﬁnal results.

However, these ballots were
mixed indiscriminately with the
rest, and on this ground alone
a new referendum‘ must be held.
Furthermore, it was openly ad-
mitted by an official in charge
of the Thaw Hall polls that‘he
inﬂuenced all those securing
rballots to cast negative votes.
Is it possible that this may be
construed as a fair and legal
practice? '

The M. S. G. A. constitution
as planned gives every school
proportional representation and‘
every male student equal suf-
frage. This equitable arrange-
ment with the unanimous ap-
proval of the M. S. G. 'A. con-
stitution ‘committee, which, as
stated above, contained repre-
sentatives from every school. It
is evident that now certain
schools are placing their own
selﬁsh desires to get more than
they deserve above what is just
and desirable for the University
of Pittsburgh as a whole,-and
-are determined to get it by un-
fair means. The M. S_. G. A.
committee intends to see that
there is a just and legal refer-
endum.

Another Good Excuse Lost‘

New Mentors
Take Course

Dean Amos Gives Training to
Fifty Junior Women

 

 

The use of Senior Mentors for
freshman women is now-in its fifth
year at the University. Formerly,
“big sisters” wereappointed to the
charge of an individual freshman
woman, a ,“lit_t,le sister.” This ar-
1'9-nsement caused the incoming stu-
dent to become isolated from the
other members of the class, so the
custom of appointing one mentor to
a grou of freshman women was in-
stitutedp. ‘

Senior mentors are chosen from
the outstanding members of the
class who able’ to fulﬁll requirements
for the oﬂlce. Mentors are required
to have a “C" average in second se-
mester 1930-31 and must not be on

robation. Attendance; at training
ours _every . Friday at drill hour,
beginning March 27, is also required.

When the mentors-are chosen in
the latter partof May, the realdu-
ties of tbenvofllce wil begin. They
will be required to: attend training
and special events during Freshman
Week in the fall; to kee Friday
Dnll‘hou.1-s fr‘ee~for‘ work with fresh-
men during the six of eight weeks
of school in the fall; to have indi-
vidual conferences whenever neces-
sary with freshmcn in their group
-between mentor meetings; to ke-ep
weekly records. on ‘individual fresh-
_men in the group; do assigned read-
ing during the training, period and
summer vacation; file. a comprehen-
sive report of mentor work at its
close’; and to‘ have ‘conferences with

 Miss .A‘nws_vor‘ Miss Rush during the

first six weeks. of school on prob-
lem: of individual girls in the group.

The period of training for Senior
Mentors is under the. personal su-
pervision of Miss Amos, who gives
$110 8'i1"l_s a regular course of per-
sonnel work. . Beginning this year,
transfers from 1 other colleges will
also be assigned, to mentor groups.

-The list of Senior ‘ Mentors at
present ismcrely tentative; the ﬁnal
selection of ‘those girls who fulﬁlled
-requir.emsntg.i’ will 116 made during
the latter part. of May. The li-st ‘at’

feared the loss of their present
strangle hold of legislation, umhr
the proportional representation plan.

The dents now have five members
on Student Council; under the pro-
portional representation clause they
would have only one delegate. On
the. other hand, the engineers and
miners, taken as a unit, who at
present have only one member on
Student Council, would be entitled to
two representatives to M. S. G. A.

Perifano Talks

Perifano, chairman of Council’s
election committee and in charge of
balloting Monday, defended his ac-
tion in permitting the dental school
to vote en masse. He said:

“Inasmuch as it has been a cus-
tom in the past -for the dental school
to vote en masse, it was thought by
the election committee that the plan
should be carried out again at this
election. However, the committee
attempted to arrange for a semi-in-
dividual balloting system. Because,
this latter form of balloting would
cause much more confusion in the
Dental Inﬁrmary, it was thought
best by the dental faculty to vote in
the lecture room.

“The Engineerng School, as a
whole, did not favor the associa-
tion for various reasons, and the
fact that they showed sufficient in-
terest to display this disfavor in the
form of voting should be consid-
ered. A proportional representation
obviously is not the solution, ‘since
two schools with a. registration less
than that of the ‘college, were able
to defeat the measure. As for the
charges of fraudulent voting, I can
only brand that as false.” ’

“In regard to Fishki»n’s statement '

that the votes were‘ to be counted

by-schools, I had no previous lm~owl- .

edge that this was‘ the method of
counting agreed upon by Student
Council.” '

College Light

Voting in Alumni Hall where the
college and business administration
students cast most of their ballots
was light throughout the day. While
the vote in the dental school, be-
cause of the procedure of voting in
class, was said to be nearly a bun-
dred per cent. 1 The poll established
in Thaw Hall, where the engineers
and miners voted, was thronged dur-
ing the voting hours. Because of
the failure of the elections commit-
tee to keep a record of the vote
compiled at each of the polling
places, however, it is impossible to
determine just how many negative

votes were cast by the dents and by‘

the engineers. Statements of lead-
ers in these two schools indicated
that the negative vote was unusually
high, according to Perifano and
Sterling. -

Apparently stirred to action by
the ‘last minute changes in-the con-'
stitution, made by Student Council,
last Thursday,~the dents and the en-
gineers over the week—end busied
themselves with a campaign to de-
feat the measure. '

President Charles Edwards, him-
self a Dental student, has been ac-
tive in support of the plan as have
Lowman Lotta, James Perifano, J.
C. Donohue and J. K. Reeder, other
dental representatives - on Council.

The M. S. G. A. organization was
first proposed last spring and after
months of effort by the constitution-
al committee a draft providing for
an equal. member system of repre-
sentation from each campus, school
was passed by Council, last month.
Believing that a. proportional sys-
tem. of representation with each
school being entitled» to one repre-
sentative for each 300 male students
enrolled, and one representative for.
each fraction of more than one-half
of 300.1 This means that 8. school
with 450 men would have been en-
titled to two representatives.

The next move in the chaotic sit-
uation rests with Student Council.
If that group acts favorably nex)
Wednesday on the petition of ' the
minority faction seeking a _revote,
the proposal will probably be again
submitted to the men on April 10.
If Councilrefuses to recognize the
petition, that body will go serenely
on with internal elections and gen-
eral elections on May 8. Certainly,
if another, vote is taken, Council will
take elaborate precautions to avoid
the -unpleasant situation which has
arisen out of Monday’s balloting.

Tradition Of English Kings
Will ‘Relive For Women
-In Rooms Of Cathedral

Tie your curls up in a pink
ribbon, gently raise your hoop
skirt, smile naively, and step
into the Georgian Room. But
instead of entering an old Eng-
lish mansion, you'll be stepping
into the women’s lounge on the
Women's floor in the Cathedral.

Georgian furniture, which fea-
tures the lounge, has a histori-
cal tradition, for‘ our colonial
ancestors brought it over from
England. Although the whole
room will be in harmony, differ-
ent sections will set set off by
arches. There v"ll be an atmos-
phere of formality; no books,
pencils, or ink will be allowed to
be broughtinto the room. Bet-
ter brush up on Emily Post, or
even better, get a book on eight-
eenth century manners!

No meetings will be held in
the lounge, for each women’:
activity will have a conference.
Administration offices will also
be on the Women's ﬂoor. Con-
ference rooms and odices will
be furnished with Georgian fur-

Plans to bring delegates from a
number of Pennsylvania, Ohio and
West Virginia colleges to the Inter-,
collegiate Student Conference to be
held on the campus, April 17, 18
and 19 are well under» way, accord-
ing to S. Clayton Newman, Col. '31,;

Dr. Bruce Curry, professor at
the Uniorl" Theological Seminary,
and author of “Facing Student
Problems,” is the principal speaker
for the conference. Dr. Curry has
been much in demand throu hout
the colleges of the United tates
and Canada, and the local unit feels

that his appearance will add a great .

deal to the conference.

Out-of-town delegates have been

Interesting Surroundings
The Laurel Hill Mountains form
one of several dparallel ridges' of
mountains exten ing in a. northeast-
southwest direction in southwestern
and central Pennsylvania. As one

— travels east 1 from Pittsburgh, the

first of these ridges is encountered

' just east of Latrobe, where the gen-
eral land surface rises in a. broad’

fold to form Chestnut Rid e, which
in some places reaches an titude of
;2,400 feet or more above sea level.
Across the Ligonier Valley and about
eleven miles southeast, the land sur-

Hill Mountains, which parallel Chest-
nut Ridge and rise to heights of 2,-
600 to 2,800 feet. . ‘

Forbes ‘Forest is a part of the

and contains several thousand acres
of land on the western slope of
Laurel Ridge. Although somewhat

The steep-sided ravines afford ‘cool

by a northern type of vegetation
characterized by hemlocks, birchco,

to be found. 1 V

The region provides 0 rtunitics‘

  W'ant Stutden t- tten Play

 Alumni SponsorContest To Get Material For

1932 Cap-Gown Production

,. Next year’s show must be student writtenll This ultimatum was
issued by the Cap and Gown production committee. At a meeting of the
group held recently, it was decidedto sponsor a contest for all students

at the University. Any one may submit a book, lyrics, or music for next ‘
made in the past to have the stu- '

year’s production. Efforts have b

dents write the songs and music for the shows, but too little interest has
been shown by the student body. The call for student-written numbers fo

“What’s Up,” was issued. at the" hen?

ginning of the year, and resulted in
several numbers submitted by stu-
dents. John St. Peter, Col. '31, sub-
mitted a “hot number,” which was
accepted and has been worked into
“What’s Up?” .
= Interviews

William Marlatt, director of
“Manhattan Preferred,” the 1930
show, and,“What’s Up?” this year’s
vehicle, will interview all students
interested in submitting material for

, the 1932 Cap and ‘Gown production,

on Tuesday, April 7, in room 2,lAc-
tivities Building, from "12 p. in. un-
til 4 p. m. At this time he will in-

terview prospective authors and

composers.

Before the close of school in June,
students who have submitted the
best-ideas for music. a book" and lib-
retto will meet with members ofthe
production committee and will be
given detailed information on the
development of the material that

‘ they have submitted. The successful

students will then have all the sum-
mer vacation to ﬁnish up their work
and will submit it in ﬁnished form
at the opening of the September se-

mester.
Record ‘Music

All music that is submitted will
be recorded on phonograph records
and will be placed on’ ﬁle with the

roduction committee. This system
is at present widely used at the east-
ern schools, the Princeton Triangle
has already accumulated a ﬁle of
more than thirty recordingsvof stu-
dent musical numbers. “The songs
will be recorded by the original com-
poser and ﬁled away,” said Marlatt.
In this manner the committee will
have the opportunity of hearing the
song just as it was played by the
composer, thus eliminating the ne-
cessity of having it played by some-
one not familiar with the song, who
in the rendition might spoil it-”

“The Cap and Gown Club,” said
Walter Rome, chairman of the pro-
d-uction committee, “has been named
one of the seven best of its type
throughout the country. The other
organizations present student-writ-
ten productions, and it is up to Cap
and Gown to do likewise. The com-
mittee feels that the 1932 show
should be the product of the stu-
dents, and therefore it is sponsoring
this contest.” .

The other organizations and
schools considered the best by Col-
lege Humor are: Harvard, the Has-
ty-Pudding Club; Mimes of the Uni-
versity of Michigan; The Triangle
Club, Princeton; Haresfoot, Univer-
sity of _W1sc'onsin; Mask and Wig of
the University of Pennsylvania; Co-
lumbia. and The Black Friars of the
University of Chicago.

The committee which will select
the best books, li ettos and music
submitted by stucle ts includes Wal-
ter J. Rome, chairman; Dr. J. Ash-
lbrook, G. Norman Reis, Louis M.

Clinic Work
Nearing End

Expect Falk Memorial to Be
Completed In May

 

 

Work on the excavation for the
Presbyterian and Eye and Ear Hos-
pital will be speedcd up as soon as
the exterior driveway and parking
space plans are deﬁnitely decided
upon, and ‘the first foundation work
will begin about May 1, states A.
A. Lyness, superintendent in charge
of construction for the contracting
company.

To date, 42,000 cubic yards of
earth «have been removed by the
workmen on the job.

At about the time excavation
work on this site is completed, the
ﬁnal work on the interior of the
Fall: Memorial Clinic, the first
building to be constructed under the
plans for the University Medical
Center, will also be ﬁnished.

During the past week workmen
have been busy washing and polish-
ing the terrazzo ﬂooring and marble
wainscoting on all the up r ﬂoors
of the clinic building. Mil work for
all the ﬂoors is now being moved
into the building and the installa-

tion and ﬁnishing .’of all such work

is going forward rapidly.

Capacity Group Hears
Bucher Talk Thursday

A capacity group turned out last
Thursday afternoon in room 202
State hall to hear John Gorge Buch-
er, former newspaper correspondent
and soldier of fortune, describe life
in modern Germany with illustra-
tions. His talk, “Germany Today,”
was sponsored by the German Club
of the University, ~

With his camera, he brought au-
thentic information regarding Ger-
many, illustrating people and places
alive with motion and glowing with
color.

Bucher was with the American
army during the World War, and
after the Armistice was signed he
traveled widely in Europe.

Trip Through Store
In New York Offered‘

Invitation to all juniors and sen-
iors who are interested in depart-
ment store work to visit their store
duringthe spring vacation has been
extended by Macy & Co., of New
York, through Lester_ H. Perry, of
the employment bureau.

‘Those interested are instructed to
arrive at the store by 10 o'clock in
the morning. on any day during the
spring vacation, including Satur-
days, and should go directly to the
training department on the sixteenth
ﬂoor. They will then be conducted
on a tour through the various de-
partments of the store.

 

It ’s Vacation, Not Bunnies,
That Makes Happy Easter

 

Eostre or Ostara, the Goddess of
S ring, will smile upon the suffering

tt students this week and say, “Go
thee forward, mine slaves, and rest
ye from Thursday till Tuesda but
come thee back prepared, for Tina]
examinations are in the offing, also
Panhellenic Ball, Activities Day,
women’s elections and the Ohio Re-
lays.” Easter vacation, the profes-
sors call it. Then the students hie
themselves home to partake of the
fatted calf and fruit and nut choco-
late Easter eggs. . ‘

Easter, we are told, is on the first
Sunday after the full moon which
follows the vernal equinox. There-
fore, by subtracting the square root
from the third decimal point, the
cosine equals the tangent and there-
by hatngs a tale. Which means that
if it weren't for calendars and smart
people we wouldn?t know when Eas-
ter comes. But ask a. smiling coed
when the Panhellenic Ball comes
and she’ll blurt out “Why, April 24.”

What this article started out to
say was that starting tomorrow is
Easter vacation, and we'll come back
next Tuesday needing a rest. To
the French student it’ll be “paque,”
to the classical greek “pascha” and
to the Italian “pas ua,” but to the
ordinary student it’l be just plain
Easter with chocolate bunnies and
Easter baskets. . .

‘ 19-

Easter was made to come at the
end of Lent, or “lencten” as the
Anglo Saxon had it; but college
changed all that. Now Easter comes
at the end of the mid-semester
exams on the eleventh hour -—
eleventh day and eleventh second
after the month when all the ma-
chines are gone from University
drive and.Dental students no longer
hang around Upper Dental.

Of course. the young ladies will
expect Easter eggs this week with
their names emblazoned thereon.
And many a college Romeo has been
praying for the full moon to fall on
Sunday so that Easter would be a
week away. The origin of the Eas-
ter egg is uncertain. It brings us
back to the old question, “what came
first, the egg "or Easter?" Many a
young swain thinks that Easter this
year is too late, it should have been
ﬁve days earlier——on All Fools? day,
they think. And even Sunny Wes-
lager shook his head and quoth*“Oh,
thou wicked Vernal Equinox” when
questioned about the Easter eggs.

And to the survivors who have
endured this drivel thus far, may
We say, “A happy Sunday after the
full moon which follows the vernal
equinox and may the Easter bunny
be nice to you next Christmas.” Or.

Edith Raschen And Jean Davis, ,

W. S. C. A.

Emphasize Activities

Although they have not as yet
taken a deﬁnite stand upon the pro-
hibition question, nor mad-e stump
speeches to rally round the ﬂag, both
oandidatesfor the presidency of W.
S.‘G. A., for next year, have aims
which they will‘ carry forward if
elected.

The planks in the platforms of
Jean Davis and Edith Raschen be-
long to no party, radical or con-
servative, and come from ‘ neither
the soap box nor a convention hall.
They are expressions of the ideals
and ambitions of the individual
women. .

“I should like to carry on the tra-
ditions of the Women’s Self Govern-
ment Association in a manner wor-
thy of them and of the University.
I should like to encourage the par-
ticipation of every woman in activi-
ties with the aim that she may add
to the glory of the University and
by broadening out their acquaint-
ance form beautiful and lasting
friendships,” was stated by Jean
Davis as her purpose.

“My aim should be to bring all
the women in close contact with
some form of activity in which she
is closely interested and try to

bring about lasting friendslﬁ s and

a more complete University ife as
a result of these contacts. The
formation of valuable associations
offers much to a successful Univer-
sity career,” said Edith when asked
to express heraim. —

Candidates,

Both Jean and Edith have been
prominent in activities during their

three years at Pitt. Jean Davis, a-

member of Delta Zeta, acted as
treasurer of W. S. G. A., and hon-
orary usher in 1930-31. As a soph-
more, she was active in Cwens, Pitt
Players, Customs committee and
treasurer of W. S. G. A. As a seri-
ous-minded girl, exceptionally accu-
rate and neat in all that she does,
well liked by all who know her and

ranking high in her scholastic work.-

Jean qualiﬁes well for the responsi-
bilities which this oiiice involves.
Jean is the sort of person who is

As a feature of the Weekly’s participation in Women’s Activities
Day on Friday, April 10, the paper will be produced entirely by the cced

members of the staff.

Heretof-ore, the women have contented themselves with editing a
rival paper, last year's production being a pink Bolshevik sheet known
as the Belles’ Yell. This time, however, they have obtained a- monopoly

Debaters On

Eastern Tour

 

Team on Last Jaunt of
Season; In 8 Meet:

 

Two men debaters will leave
Pittsburgh tomorrow night at six
o’clock on the ﬁnal speaking tour
of the forensic season, meeting the
debate teams of eight eastern col-
leges and universities in discussing
the question, “Resolved: That the
Several States Should Enact Legis-
lation Providing for Compulsory Un-
employment Insurance.”

Edward T. Crowder Jr., Col. ’31,
and Jess Spirer, Col. '31, the student
team, accompanied by Professor W.
M. Parrish, debate coach and profes-
sor of public speaking, will be ab-
sent from the campus for ten days,
returning to Pittsburgh Monday
morning,» April 13. .

Friday of this week the men will
speak against a two-man team of
the City College of New York, in
New York. The following day, Sat-
urday, they are scheduled to meet
the representatives of New York
University in the second debate of
the trip. Easter Sunday will ﬁnd
the three men still in New York,
where they expect to attend church
irrthe morning, spend the remainder
of the day visiting friends in the

city.
Debate in the Hub

The third debate of the trip will
be held in Boston, where Crowder
and Spirer are to speak against the
team -of Boston University, which
debated in Pittsburgh several weeks

go. _

The next day, Tuesday, the Pitt
men will make history, at least, Pitt
history, for they are to take part
in a, formal split-team debate with

. two women representatives of Rad-

cliiie College, at Cambridge, Mass.
The split-team debate provides that

both teams exchange partners, one ,

speaker from each team going to
the other side. Thus, each Pitt man
will be allied with a Radcliffe wom-
an in the defense of their particu-
lar case, This is the first time that
the Men’s Debating Association has
taken part in a split-team debate
with any coed organization.

The University of.New Hamp-
shire, at Durham, N. H., are the
next opponents to be met on the
trip, the debate being held Wednes-
day, April 8. Leaving Durham, the
debaters will be forced to rise at 6
o’clock, so that they ma make con-
nections with a train t at will _en-.
able them to reach New Brunswick,
N. J., in time’ for the debate with

' Rutgers University that night.

Dear Old Rutgers

This will be the longest one-day
jump that will have to be made be-
tween engagements on the trip.
From Rutgers the debaters will go
to Philadelphia, where they meet
the forensic stars of both the Uni-
versity of-.Pennsylvania and Temple
University on Friday and Saturday,‘
April 10 and 11. 2

Coach Parrish and his charges
will spend the following Sunday in
Philadelphia, visiting points of in-
terest in the city and recuperating
from the strain of the constant
speaking before making the last lap
of the tour. They will arrive in
Pittsburgh some time early Monday
morning, with barely time to reach
their ﬁrst classes.

J Assembly Programs A  

. HE ASSEMBLY PROGRAM at the Uni-
, versity this year has been a haphazard
‘one. An irregular schedule, insufficient pub-
‘- licity, and failure to obtain,an interesting and
varied selection of speakers have been its prin-
’ cipal faults. -
Under the present arrangements whereby
the Administration, Student Council and the
' Y.‘ M. C. A. all have a hand in presenting pro-
grams, a hodgepodge set of conditions is the
result. This unsatisfactory circumstance is to
be avoided in the future.“
g. . What many persons conceive to be the ideal
.}' arrangements would be to have a deﬁnite pro-
'a_‘_-gram of ﬁve or six assemblies presenting an
. interesting and cultured group of personalities
 at regularly scheduled intervals throughout the
- school year. The programshouldbe completely
A‘ organized at the opening of , school inthe fall,
,  and a systematic method of securing publicity
_— _..__ for the assembly series should be adjusted. Lo-
? _cated in a district to which every week come
’ 7-It celebrities and countless well informed students
 .,..of contemporary problems,~Pitt should beable
 present an assembly schedule that few Uni-
‘ versities could rival. '
 The Twentieth Century Club, the new home
 of which is adjacent to the campus, the Hun-
gry.Club, and the Cham:ber of Commerce, are
}.;only a few of the civic‘ organizations that are
" bringing to Pittsburgh, a continuous list of
modern speakers and entertainers. Among the

Club programs during the past few months
":have been Sir Hubert Wilkins and Roy Chap-
man Andrews. _' '
These organizations are now planning their
 . programs for next year. Would they accept an
_ arrangement whereby the University might
75§"'_‘ co-operate with them in booking speakers?
,9” ‘With this plan in-effect it would, therefore, be
. ,'possible for a speaker such as Sir Hubert Wil-
V-kins to address the members of the Twentieth
. ~_g Century Club and the Pitt student body for a
 -charge that would be only slightly ‘higher than
§;;_'...1;-hat now paid by the‘ club. The expense would
“.:._.be_ borne partly by the University and partly
'_  the Club. ‘ -

.‘Campus Leaclers Comment
On Grading Question

Intelligence or _ actual ' work—-which should determine a student's
grade? Complementing the professors’ opinions on this subject that were

”  printed in the Weekly two weeks ago, these student opinions shouldgive

  
    

_a well-rounded view of the subject. The students quoted are all prom-
inent on the campus. It is interesting to note that the opinions of the
students and those of the professor are not contrasting but coincide in
the main. There is a slight tendency for the student to desire credit for

latent capacity, that unearned ad-0
vantage of superior intelligence.

Eddie Baker, captain of last
. year's football team, co-captain of
V the basketball team, and high honor
 student, sees a parallel in football:

“It’s just like in football; the re-
sults matter. One is judged by
what he does. He has to put his in-
- telligence to work. As a standard,
I favor grading a student on the
actual work done, keeping in mind
that the method of measuring what
a student has done might be inac-
curate. I think that allowance should
also be made for lack of interest or
., incentive.” '

Robert McEwan, Pitt’s candidate
for the Rhodes’ Scholarship, con-
siders “humoring” the instructor as
an important factor in determining
the grade: '

“Eminent educators to the con-
trary notwithstanding, there is no
direct correlation between the grade
' given and the student's ability or
knowledge. The grade is just as
much an indication of the student’s
ability to ‘impress’ as it is his abil-
 ity to master the facts of..the course.
 .Each professor is a different prob-
lem; the ‘technique uf manipulation’
 varies in each case. It is the stu-
_.dents who are able to adapt them-
, «selves to their individual instruc-

‘tors who as considered the ‘intelli-
gent’ ones.” _ ,

Hermine Ruoﬂ’, president of Mor-
tar Board and Chief Justice of Sen-
 ior Court, emphasizes the way the
, ‘ work is done:

' . “The originality and style, the in-
-. itiative a piece of work evidences

, should be the basis of the compari-
son of. students. Any one piece of
work might not truly express the
student’s capacity, but all his work
should yield a justifiable judgment
of him. I lay emphasis on the qual-
ity of the work. Speaking of qual-
ity, I am opposed to crammingvas

it is not a fair estimate of a stu-
p_.g_lent’s ability.” V

method. To quote from that" student paper:

“There is not an ideal si__tuati’on facing the
educational world today. The hampering in‘-
iluenceof the “four-year loaferf’ and misﬁt on

educational circles. ‘The need_ for a’ weeding-

has been ’invented_ to meet, - - ~ - 1 “

“Aside from, their value‘in_'this respect, ‘ex-
aminations perform " another function,
urge they develop for work by holding a threat
over the head of « the . undergraduate. Even
grades, however faulty and inexact they may
be, providea certain visible record‘ of achieve-
ment, which serves. as .a kind of compensation
for energyexpended. "It offers an opportunity,
of a sort for a man to —check.up on himself,_to
give directionto his efforts. Of course; ' too
often examinations bring, arigid limiting inﬂii-_
ence that makes for fact-cramming, but-that
type of test is here, at. least, happily tendingto
disappear, giving rise to questions demanding
more comprehensive,* integrated knowledge. ;A
third feature of e_xamination"s is the forced re-
view of the courseas aiwhole, which-they ne-

o‘ it. One's capacity, one’s ability
to handle, a situation is the thing

that counts.” . .

Theodore Savage, associate editor
of the Weekly and the‘ 0wl,'points
out that the emphasis of the Ameri-
can College System is on passing
the course rather than on mastering
the material: W --
'.“Intelligence is the main thing!
The really’ intelligent student who
doesn't need ‘to use the textbook but
who desires the diploma, resorts to
‘mental backslapping.’ His study
satisfies the teacher's grading stan-
dards, but itdoes not satisfy what
otherwise would be his desire to
master the course. The present
American .'system of grading, then,
does not apply to the really intelli-
gent student who does not need to
be coaxed along by the instructor.
By itscompulsions, it only succeeds
in curbing his desire to learn." The
tutorial system might remedy this
disadvantage.” " O‘ ‘ ~ ‘

Samuel Strauss, president of the
Men's Debating Association, A thinks
that the grade should be based upon
whata student does above the re-
quirements for passing the course:

“The minimum requisites of a
course determine. whether a student
passes. But the evaluation of stu-
dents above this should depend upon
that extra measure of thought or
attention a student accords the
work. Here is where the greater
abilityevidences itself, and itis this

Is nothing.”

-In a recent tissue-of -the Historical
.Outlook, .21 history journal, Dr. Al-

 

at the University, in an article en-
titled “A Stud in the Intellectual
Life of Colonial, America,” describes
the stimulus’ which led him to of-
fer a. courseat the University, and
traces its development and results.
Twenty years ago Professor
James, then a graduate student in
the University of Chicago, took
work with Professor Marcus Wilson
Jernegan in thesocial and economic
history of the American colonies.
“In lecture courses in this field" he
was a pioneer in", American universi-
ties,”- writes Professor James,‘ “His
outlines, lecture notes and methods
have been the foundation of a sim-'
ilar course which at intervals for
nearly a decade I have endeavored
to teach in the University of. Pitts-
burgh.” ‘ '

' History or Colonies

' ‘.‘In 1927 there came‘ from the
press a _ remarkable volume, ‘The
Colonial Mind, 1620-1800,’ by Ver-

Englishin the ‘University _of Wash-_
ington. The additional stimulus of
this book led me‘ to offer a course

‘_The Intellectual History of the
American Colonies,’ with it as a
guide and a point of departure.”
The course, highly’ experimental,
was tried’ out in three c asses. 0116
composed~'ojf day ‘students, another
of" night‘ students, largely, teachers,
and the third with Saturday stu-
dents, also largely teachers.
First_’of all, it was decided to
formulate in advance a list of the
ideas, opinions, be'li'efs;and attitudes
which had to be looked for in colo-
nial writiii-gs. This took from six
to eight weeks of reading and -dis-
cussion, with students and instruc-
torworking in collaboration. Each
student was re uired topread at this

material and hand in an analysis of
items of -thought discoveredin the
reading. , ‘ W . l . p

the article. » ’ .
This list was distributed to thé

all the items A. in

of excerpts to be taken from the
writings of3Am'erican ‘colonials. _A
list’ of colonia.l_ writers was drawn
up and individual assignments were
made. In the ﬁrst semester, the ‘ef-
fort’ was ‘made’ to study only the
writings falling’ within "the period
before 1750. I 5 .~ '
Professor James describes the
ﬁrst, report, doneby a-young lady,.a
graduate student teaching in the
public ‘schools, which was, in the
unanimous opinion’ of’ the experi-
enced teachers of the class,"‘a gem
of both’ science“ and art." ’
Professor James describes the
work during the ‘second semester, the
earnestness with which the students
worked on the experiment,~and com-
ments on some of the writers who
were reported by the students-
_“The whole question of the gene-
sis, background _and evolution of
American colonial thought proved
[from such an investigation tobe
worthy of « the greatest effort to
master it," Professor James writes.
“Professor Parrington’s volume in-
dicates the gold which may be mined
from? the mountains of existing lit-
erary remains. The ramiﬁcations of
‘such study inevitably ‘carry one off
into every aspect of American colo-
nial history.” ' - ‘
‘ An investigation which the in-
structor has in mind is~that of; the
collegiate and-‘post-collegiate educa-
tion abroad of men who came to the
colonies or went from the colonies
to Europe for" their education
abroad, and the inﬂuences thereby
transmitted to America. It is evi-
dentthat many general ideas came
from -Europe. How far did particu-
lar. ideas come". from European
schools?. ‘An "answer to this ques-
tion may. explain -much in Ameri-

season by tying Rankin High school.

Pitt Ninth Place
Nationally

The Pitt rifle team came through,
with a. fourth place in the champion- ;
ship shoulder to shoulder match of
the Eastern Division of the National
Riﬂe Association, held last Saturday
at the Annapolis range. Unoﬁicial-
ly, the Pitt score, which was 1.320.
will rank Pitt as ninth in the entire
country. i

The Pitt riﬂers, who made the
best record of any Pitt range team
in history. also took a higher place
Saturday than Pitt riﬂers have ever;
been able to cop before. _LaSt Year
Pitt ended up fourteenth in the East
and nineteenth in the country. This
year,‘ because of its record during
the latter part of the season and in
the championships, the Pitt team

Prone Scores Low

It-was the low scores in the stand-
ing position that pulled the Pitt total
down. If scores only comparatively
equal to those made in the prone po-
sition or even in the kneeling, had
been made in the prone. the Pitt

neighborhood of first. _ _

The total Pitt score in the prone
was 489. In the kneeling 447 was
aggregated and in the standing the

This gave a ﬁnal grand total of
1,320, which was less than the
scores of Navy, George Washington
College and University of Mary-
iand. Other teams who were ranked

ut whom Pitt beat out were Johns
Hopkins, Cornell, University of
Pennsylvania, Penn State, Columbus,
Brooklyn Polytechnical Institute and
Cooper Union.

McKinney, manager of the team,
rang up the highest t0l’.a.l‘.1I1d1V.ld-
ual score, one of 274. Captain Hem-
pel was second with a score of 2'71.
and Hodge took third with 264. The
highest total of any riﬂer in the
Eastern division was that of _25‘1
made by Barr of George Washing-

take second and Hunter and Moore,
both of Navy, each rang up 279 to

College Cynicism Appalling,
Says Assembly Speaker

 

“The lightness with which stu-
dents take world questions, serious
questions, in a.n atmosphere of so-
phistication and cynicism is appal-
ling,” Dr. Sherwood Eddy, nation-
ally known thinker and lecturer, told
students at a general assembly in
Memorial Hall last Monday noon.

After throwing direct challenges
to the students, Dr. Eddy cited his
visits to the leading ﬁgures in the
political and economic life of Eu-
rope and Asia. He was ﬁrm in his
demand for the declaration of a
principle on the part of the Ameri-
can student. “We're in the midst
of one of the greatest transitional
epochs in all history,” he declared.

“It is an epoch which is greater
than the Reformation," the Renais-
sance and the French Revolution.
Everywhere I went I saw signs ‘of
intellectual, political and economic
unrest. The people throughout the
world are demanding a basic eco-
nomic justice. The old status quo is
breaking up and we’re on the way,
we know not exactly where, but un-
doubtedly to a greater and better
day.”

D1‘. Eddy outlined the three great
experiments throughout the world,

Our ﬁrst Pitt co-eds——there were ' sleeves, high waist line, long skirt,

about 50 of them way back whenllow or high neck linercollar or no

this school first began-weren’t
afraid of rats, at least not in their
hair. And 2. college education taught
them a healthy fear of (what they
considered) excess clothing.

But they did wear
then. No decent girl would be
heard without one. Yes, I mean
heard, for they were made of taf-
feta which rustled when they
walked. The degree to which it
rustled must‘ ave determined the
quality. Or perhaps, the quantity.

Black was the color for footwear.
Black laced high top shoes and black
cotton stockings could be worn in
keeping with any dress for school.
Once a girl came out in tan foot-
wear. She was still accepted in
Pitt society, but undoubtedly she
had taken a risk. , .

The favorite dress in which to at-
tend classes was the “jacket sui .”
The “Norfolk” cut was ultra-colle-
giate, especially when it was dark
blue. - .

Imagine The Blush ,

Peek-a-boo waists and slit skirts
were born by the very nth degree
of “hot” 'women. No nice‘ young
male student would be seen on the
campus with a. coed so attired.
Peek-a-boo waists had holes in
them which enabled even professors
to see the skin over the arms and
shoulders. But that wasn’t the
worst. Slit skirts opened up when
a girl walked up. the landing steps
so that the whole extremity of the
limb could be seen, even up to the
knee! .

There was very little jewelry
worn. Rich steel magnates’ daugh-
ters sometimes could afford it, but
otherwise only heirlooms were worn
by students. I

The evening dress donned for the
college formals was identical with
that worn at present: short puff

collar.
And What Hats
Huge hats were worn at Pitt.
Once in a while they were taken off

._during a class, but most of the
petticoats,

time they were perched on top of
a mop of hair which stuck out from
the back of the hat. Long hat pins
and long hair pins were the vogue.
It was an unwritten law of State
Hal] that no girl walk  Oakland
without her hat on. Heinz H0050
might adopt this, _ .

No one smoked. This is a secret,
though. It was done at times when
boys bet real mone_v that a C084
wouldn’t. But ofcourse they would
have never bought their own cig-
arettes. Powder was used on the
sly. It was a “talc” or rice pow-
der. Every coed carried hey rice
paper. Rouge and lipstick were
banned.

Hungarian Students
Plan National Group

A movement is afoot to unite all
the many Hungarian clubs in the
colleges and universities overthe
country into one national organiza-
tion. At an open forum of» the loc
Hungarian Students’, Club‘ and the
Hungarian Reformed Church of Du-
quesne last Sunday, the possibility
of organizing was discussed.~

It was pointed out that there ex-
ists in American colleges" and uni-
versities many student's organiza-
tions whose members are of H_un-
garian extraction. A nation-wide
organization, embracing all. of these
various clubs, would be highly ad-
vantageous. It would bring about a.
closer relationship between college
students. A committee was formed
to study the matter minutely before
ﬁnal steps are taken. . '
