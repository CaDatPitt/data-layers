For eight tumultuous sea-
sons, the Pitt basketball pro-
gram has had its share of
pressing moments off the
floor. They can now expect a
few on the court as well.

With a Hair for the dramatic,
Pitt athletic director Oval
Jaynes yesterday announced
to media, former players and
Golden Panthers that former
Western Kentucky head coach
and Rick Pitino disciple Ralph
Willard will succeed Paul
Evans as the university’s 12th
basketball coach on, of all
days, Willard’s 48th birthday.

“I think we got the one we
wanted, and we’re extremely
pleased that Ralph Willard is
going to be our coach,” jaynes
said, presenting Willard with a
slew of gifts including an elab-
orately decorated birthday
cake. “The most important
thing we were looking for is
someone who would fit in at
Pitt and could relate to our
students. We just felt that
Ralph brought that type of
enthusiasm and could rally
our troops and get people
back into a positive vein.”

“This has been a very excit-
ing time for us —— we come

here with the intent of.contin-
uing the growth of this pro-
gram.” said Willard, whose
wife Dottie sat on the first row
of seats below him as he
spoke. “The program will be
based on one guiding princi-
ple: the total development,
academically, atlrletically and
socially, of our student-ath-
letes.”

Jaynes’ decision came after
an extensive interviewing
process where various athletic
directors, coaches and key
basketball people were con-
tacted, and only one coach -
Willard himself —— was for-
mally interviewed.

“During the last few weeks
we have conducted a nation-
wide search seeking out the
best candidates,” jaynes said.
“We have received valuable
input from top basketball peo-
ple across the country, and the
name Ralph Willard continued
to be on everyone’s list. He
has proven to be successful at
every level of coaching.”

The Brooklyn, N.Y., native

ago, a supposed lock to suc-
ceed Rick Barnes at

sent someone over. And they never fixed it
right.”

Student Government Board legal advisor
Mark Galzerano said about 75 percent of the
appointments made with him concern land-
lord/tenant complaints. Galzerano said the
best protection against problems such as
Taft’s is to talk to someone who currently
lives in the apartment.

“I found out later,” said Taft, “that this hap-
pened a lot of times before I moved into the
apartment.” He said he wished he knew
about the sewage problem beforehand.

Galzerano, who provides free 20-minute

ate student, said he receives two common
complaints. First, he. said, students often
complain when a landlord does not fix dam-
ages before the lease starts.

He said the second, “a big complaint in
Oakland,” is when a landlord refuses to
return the security deposit because of dam-
ages that existed before the tenants moved
into the apartment.

There are ways tenants can legally protect
themselves against such problems, according
to Galzerano. He said prospective renters
should carefully and thoroughly check the

research

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Citing excessive administra-
tive demands and insufficient
time, Dr. Bernard Fisher has
requested administrative leave
from the chair of National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project to continue his
investigations "which relate tc
breast cancer and which are so
important" to the women of this
country."

According to Pitts Health
Sciences News Bureau. Senior
Vice Chancellor of Health
Sciences Thomas Detre has
accepted Fisher’s request and
appointed Dr. Donald Tflllllj‘,
to chair the NSABBP. Trump is
a professor of medicine
and surgery and deputy director
of the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute.

The announcement came one
day after the I’ittsbz/rgb Post-
Gazetle reported that federal
officials asked Pitt to replace
Dr. Bernard Fisher, in light oi
more suspicious research used
in a landmark breast’ cancer

study conducted by the
NSABBP.

In his statement released
Tuesday evening, Fisher

said the published conclusions
of NSABBP’s breast cancer
studies remain valid and are not
compromised by any recent
developments.

He said he believes the

process will fully confirm this
fact.

Irony found its way to the William Pitt
Union last night, as Congressional
Representative William Coyne spoke
to the University Democrats about health
care, welfare reform and crime, just
one door away fronrwhere the Col-
lege Republicans were holding a meet-
ing.

Coyne, an Oakland native, credited
President Bill Clinton being in office as
a reason for change in this country.
“After 12 years of Republican vetoes and
gridlock, Democratic members of
Congress have welcomed the opportuni-

change.”

As example, Coyne gave the family
and medical leave bill. A bill, he said,
that first surfaced while President Bush
was in office, but was vetoed upon
reaching the White House.

“Contrary to the ‘Me Decade’ of
President Reagan, in which government
was viewed as a necessary evil, President
Clinton and the Democratic members of
Congress are committed to making gov-
ernment serve the common good,” said
Coyne.

As evidence, Coyne said the govern-
ment was funding research for AIDS and

Ideas for opportunity and reform in the
Mon Valley became the main topics for
three Congressional candidates in the 18th
district at last nights College Republicans
meeting. '

Third-year law student Matt Berger, rep-
resenting candidate John McCarty, came to
the meeting to inform the CR5 of McCarty’s
ideas for change in the Mon Valley.

Berger said environmental clean-up is
near the top of McCarty’s agenda.

“John feels there needs to be swifter
clean-up of the Mon sites,” Berger said,
“and under the Superfund lstrict environ-

efficiently and quickly.”
Berger said crime is by far the most

important priority on McCarty’s list, and he -

and McCarty have some “creative solu-
tions” to fix the problem.

“There’s a lot of abandoned mills and
buildings in the area [that can be used as
prisonsl,” Berger said. “We canrutilize
those resources and not shove the burden
on the taxpayers.”

McCarty would also push for a crime
victims’ reimbursement fund, according to
Berger, in which a criminal must forfeit a
percentageof his or her assets to pay for
the victim’s medical expenses or for darn-

cancer, providing grants for col-
lege students, and passing legis-
lation to promote economic
growth. ‘

On the topic of universal
health—care coverage, Coyne, a
strong supporter of reform since
the late ‘80s, said Congress was
working with President Clinton
to guarantee affordable insur-
ance for everyone.

But Coyne said, “President
Clinton’s [health-carel plan, as
introduced, will not be the final
product.”

The health-care plan that
will probably be passed will
contain elements from five dif-

ferent bills on health care
reform. --

Coyne also spoke about wel-
fare reform.

“I agree with President
Clinton that the time has come
to change the way welfare is
provided to people in this coun-
try.”

He said he believes the vast
majority of those on welfare
want to find a job, but do not
have the work experience or
skills needed to obtain employ-
ment.

“The best way to reform wel-
fare programs would be to pro-
vide those individuals with the
training needed to obtain a job,”

Coyne said. “lBut] it makes no
sense to talk about placing a
limit on the length of time wel-
fare benefits can be paid to
individuals unless there is a job
that can be done by the person
leaving welfaref’

Coyne said the federal
government should help states
train and educate welfare recip-
ients, and should avoid the
“one size fits all” approach,
because it deals with real
human beings.

On the crime issue, Coyne
said over the past few years
he has voted for anti-crime
legislation that has stiffened
penalties for the criminal use

of a gun, supported established
mandatory sentencing for
specific criminal acts, and voted
to make Carjacking a federal
crime.

“Every American should be
able to walk safely in his or her
neighborhood in this country,“
Coyne said.

“We should not have to barri-
cade ourselves in our homes
and isolate ourselves from our
community.”

On April 12, a representative
of Harris Wofford will speak to
the University Democrats on
health—care reform. Also, elec-
tions for next terrn’s officers will
be held.

caused damages and some-
times past—due rent."

Within 30 days after a
tenant moves out, the law
says the landlord must give
the tenant a written list of
any damages caused and a
refund of the deposit less
the costs of the repairs on
the list. If the landlord does
not do this, the tenant can-
not be sued for any dam-
ages the landlord claims.

In addition, if the land-
lord does not give the ten-

the lease. “When you
move out,” the agency said,
“such records will assure that

your security deposit will only

be applied to damages for which
you are responsible.”

Before worrying about an
unreturned security deposit,
Galzerano said tenants must still
face an entire lease term where
maintenance and damage prob-
lems may arise. ’

Sophomore Maureen Fox said
although she is happy with her
apartment, the landlord has
been slow to respond to mainte-
nance problems. “[The realty
company] gave us a list of emer-
gency things they would repair
right away,” she said, “and they
never handled it any differently
than any minor problems.”

Senior Michael Hedrick, who
once rented from a private
owner, said his oven never
worked and his ceiling col-
lapsed.

Galzerano said when non-ten-
ant-caused damages occur, the
tenant should notify the landlord
in writing and give the landlord
a reasonable period of time to
fix the problem.

Hedrick said he experienced
another problem in his apart-
ment. “The landlord hadn’t paid
his gas bill,” he said. “So lall the
tenants] got these notices from
the gas company saying our gas
would be turned off.”

After meeting with the other
tenants of the building, Hedrick
said he wrote to the landlord
and said the tenants would pay
for the gas to be turned on in the
building and have the expenses
deducted from the next rent bill.

Is this legal? Yes.

Galzerano.said that if the land-
lord does not respond to a com-
plaint, the tenant has the right to
notify the landlord again, in writ-
ing, and allot a reasonable peri-
od of time for repairs to be

Galzerano said there are a few
instances when tenants are legal-
ly able to withhold rent, but the
apartment must be classified as
“uninhabitable.” He said some
examples of uninhabitable con-
ditions include no heat, broken
sewage lines, no electricity or
major defects in the apartment.
Tenants experiencing these
problems must realize that with-
holding rent is a complicated
decision and should consult a
lawyer, according to Galzerano.-

When a security deposit is not
returned in full or at all, tenants

ant a 50-day notice or
return to deposit within that
period, the law permits the ten-
ant to sue the landlord for dou-
ble the amount of the security
deposit.

Galzerano said tenants who
pursue this line of action should
consult with a lawyer or read the
Landlord—Tenant Law to under-
stand the details of the proce-
dure.

landlord problems can contact

Candidate Bill Gallagher
also said he believes crime is
“an incredible problem" in
not just the Mon Valley, but in
all communities.

“"X/e’re all scared to death
that the country is headed in
the wrong direction,“
Gallagher said, “and were
afraid that by the time we
reach the age for social secu-
rity, there’ll be no country
left.”

All the candidates agreed
the proposed expressway
connecting the Mon Valley
to Pittsburgh must be built
to help the regions economy.

“The number one problem
in the area isn’t crime or
the environmental laws,”
argued candidate Alan
Wampler.

“It’s that you can’t get there,
and once you’re there, you
can’t get out.”

\Vampler added that his
relationship with the business
community will help build
the expressway directly into
Pittsburgh

McCarty would also push
for federal aid on Capital Hill
for the expressway, accord-
ing to Berger.

“The federal government
can help with maximum
funding," he said. “Its
absolutely critical for the peo-
ple in the area.“

Gallagher and \\7’ampler’
each said they had the best
qualifications for the congres-
sional position, but for differ-
ent reasons.

\Y/ampler said he has mod-
eled his campaign after 18th

“I started early, I knocked
on doors. I built a strong
coalition no one has
worked harde.r than me,“ he
said.

“Direct experience sets me
apart.“ Gallagher said. He
then told how he returned to
Pittsburgh to save his fathers
company.

“It’s extremely important to
have direct experience in
building up a community that
essentially was destroyed,” he
said.

Jaynes. “We started zeroing in

Jaynes offered him a contract

Willard said he would contin-

ue to follow the university’s
path of recruiting only players
who have the “desire and abili-
ty” to earn a college degree, and
added that that can be accom-
plished through the junior col-
lege ranks as well as with rook-
ies. .
“The best way you can build a
program is with freshmen, but I
think that there are quality stu-
dent-athletes out there that are
in the junior college ranks, and
there are times you have to turn
to them to fill a specific need,”
he said. “Certainly at Western
Kentucky we have recruited
both freshmen and junior col-
lege players and have had suc-
cess with both, both in terms of
graduation and in terms of their
input into the program.

“You don’t want to do any-
thing that is going to be stop-
gap. Youwant to do something
that will really build your pro-
gram. I wouldn’t sacrifice any-
thing.”

 
 
   

With his ties to New York —
Willard served as an assistant
with the New York Knicks for
three years and was an assistant
at Syracuse for one —— Willard
said they will recruit heavily,
but not exclusively, in New
York City.

He did, however, take full
responsibility for those players
who remained after Evans left,
and said, despite expectations
for future classes, these players
are “his.”

“[Because of the new system]
it’s going to be a period of
adjustment for the kids to
understand the system and to
go with it,” he said. “But the
kids that are in the program
right now are my kids  there’s
not going to be the attitude that
‘wait until I get my ‘kids’ -
these are my kids. We’re going
to build and we’re going to win
with them in the program.”

Willard attributed his success
at Western Kentucky — an 81-
42 overall record including a
pair of NCAA Tournament
appearances and a trip to the
Sweet 16 last year —- to a close-
ness amongst the team that he
wants to foster with future Pitt
teams.

things we will instill at Pitt. We

“There were a lot of hugs and
a lot of tears when I announced
on Sunday that I was leaving
the program. We had such qual-
ity kids that they wanted the
best for me and my family and
they understood that.” 0

and Willard and helped both in
the ﬁnal decision.

“We talked to John, and he’s an
excellent coach and certainly had
a lot to do with our process,”
Jaynes said. “I know John and
Ralph talked, and John was very
complimentary with Pittsburgh.
He has a good situation at UMass
and has done an outstanding job
there.”

Willard said in his conversa-
tions with Calipari, the UMass
head coach said that Pitt “was a
tremendous opportunity” and
that he was very positive about
its potential.

He also credits Pitino as a con-
siderable influence on his style,
but insists that Pitt basketball will
not become Kentucky-East.

“We’re dear friends, but we’re
competitive with each other.

health officials to Pittsburgh
to review cases used in
the study, leaving questions as
to whether the study will con-

tinue to be based in
Pittsburgh.
Two weeks ago the

NSABBP, of which Fisher is
chair, announced its support
of Fishers declaration that the
1985 breast study was valid
despite falsified data included
in the study.

The new suspicion revolves
around the research submitted
by a doctor in a Montreal hos-

pital, but not St. Luc Hospital
which was the origin of earlier
flawed data, according to the
Post—Gazette. The acknowl-
edged misconduct in the study
involved research submitted
by Dr. Poisson of St. Luc in
Montreal.

The study, published in Tbe
New England journal of
Medicine, concluded radiation
treatment of breast cancer
along with a lumpectomy is
just as effective as removal of
the entire breast in some
cases. The findings have led
several thousand women to

opt for the simpler radiation
and lumpectomy treatment
since 1985.

Because of the scope
of these findings, national
attention has been focused on
the Pitt-based NSABBP since
the revelation of possible
flawed data. National health
officials were critical of Fisher
for taking too long to show
the effect of the flawed data
on the conclusions of the
study.

Recently however, accord-
ing to the NSABBP, “multiple
reanalyses” have shown

that even without Poisson"s
falsified reports, there is
no change in the study’s find-
ings.

In addition, federal officials
commissioned three indepen-
dent statisticians to reanalyze
the ﬂawed data’s effect on the
study.

If suspicions are confirmed,
it would be the second inci-
dence of misconduct in
a study including more than
5,000 physicians and
484 medical centers and com-
munity hospitals in North
America.

It's time to set realistic goals

Last Saturday morning, Congress made a bold move
in elevating the standard of American education. They
finally approved the Goals 2000: Educate America Act,
which attempts to set out some concrete goals for what
every graduating high school senior should know
(Time). The goals are broken down into broad areas
and include the following intellectual achievements:

In the arts, students will be expected to know dances
and dancers’ from before the 20th century. They also
should be aware, at least according to Congress, of the
historical roots of American musical theater, and be
able to identify famous musicians.

In math, students will be expected-to be able to use
a calculator, and use charts, tables and graphs. Along
the same lines, in science, they will be expected to
know what matter is, to understand reproduction and
heredity and to define what a cell is.

Students will henceforth be expected to write clearly
and know how to use the thesaurus while doing so.

In history and geography, graduating seniors will be‘

expected to be able to know. how to use atlases, maps
and globes, and to explain how war, disease and
famine play a role in human migration. They must also
be able to identify the differences between the
Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and
the Magna Carta. While these goals are nice and may
in some areas lead to more highly educated graduates,
they seem to gloss over the real problems that the
schools face in terms of curricula.

If Congress really wishes to make a difference in
education, they should develop a realistic national cur-
riculum.

Instead of focusing on frivolities, such as the roots of
American Musical Theater, they should focus on impor-
tant issues in education such as basic literacy. The
United States needs to focus on having its students
being able to read at a 12th-grade level, something
we’re far from achieving seeing as there are still high
school graduates unable to function in the real world.

It is important to have a clear idea of the direction
that American education should take, however, identi-
fying dancers and dances of pre-20th century America
will not produce the necessary level of education
needed to move this country into the next century.

A useful national curriculum would be one that
focused on competency in mathematics, the ability to
speak and write English, as well as other languages,
clearly, science literacy and developing an understand-
ing of U.S. history and government.

This would go much further toward creating a solid
foundation that high school graduates could use in fur-
thering their education than a nebulous set of goals
about what students are supposed to know.

Students prove apathy myth Wrong

Students don’t care about anything but them-
selves. College students are only concerned with
where the next party is and how much beer will
be provided. Student apathy, student apathy,
student apathy. Sound familiar?

Pitt students are often criticized for their lack
of concern for the environment around them, by
not only those already involved and looking for
new members, but by the newspapers (includ-
ing this one) and by their own student govern-
ment board. Public Safety officers provide self-
defense workshops which, on a good day,
maybe two people attend.

By just looking at the many groups who place
ads begging for active members it is obvious
thereis much to be done on this campus and
not many people interested in making the com-
mitment to do it. On the surface it seems as if
only a handful of students care to recognize the
needs and even fewer choose to become

with their annual Greek Week. Over 2,000 stu-
dents participated in events raising over
$100,000 which was donated to Pennsylvania
Special Olympics. .

But it isn’t the money raised that sticks out in
my mind, it’s the time and effort of students try-
ing to make someone else’s life a little better.
Along with the fundraising activities, the Greeks
sponsored a carnival for Special Olympians and
included Special Olympians in their dance
marathon, once again trying to bridge a gap of
friendship to children often forgotten in activities
such as dances and carnivals.

In this microcosm we live in, it’s easy to forget
there are bigger problems around us than those
of getting an office in the union, where the
Student Government Board is taking their retreat
or whether or not the student press should be
permitted to cover events.

Battling bureaucracy often isn’t the fun it’s

involved in initiating change.

this one) and perhaps students

little happier while allowing

or do they simply not want to
join any of the 200-or-so clubs on campus?
Looking around campus it would be easy to
assume the great majority of Pitt students are the
epitome of laziness and possibly selfishness.A
few weeks ago, I would not have simply
assumed this, but would have gone so far as to
state this as an indisputable fact.
But after witnessing the events of the past two

weeks, ‘I was forced "to rethink my views and

surprisingly enough, I've concluded it's time, to
give Pitt students some credit.

At this weekend's Hand-in-Hand Festival, over
400 Pitt students volunteered their entire
Saturday to spend time with handicapped chil-
dren from Allegheny county. Students arrived by
9:30 to either meet the child they would be tak-
ing around for the day, or to set up a carnival-
style booth for the kids to win prizes at.

The entire first ﬂoor of Forbes Quad was filled
with children and college students playing
games together, laughing together, and most
importantly, gaining a better understanding of
one another while having fun.

The entirely student-organized annual event
once again united children and students in a day
both groups enjoyed. At three o'clock I realized
that all 400 students were still putting in their
full effort to make the day enjoyable for the chil-
dren. Hardly a demonstration of the student apa-
thy thought to run rampant on this campus.

This isn’t the only recent demonstration of Pitt
students reaching out to the community ‘on a
large scale for the sake of others.Despite the
negative stereotypes of the Greek system, _.Pitt
sororities and fraternities came through again

themselves to feel they made a
difference. In the past two weeks, over 2,500 Pitt
students volunteered their time to try and bring
a day of happiness and normalcy into the lives
of hundreds of handicapped children.

Although 2,500 is far from a majority of the
campus, in my three years covering events for
the newspaper I'm hard pressed to think of any
other set of events in which such a large num-
ber of students participated — all for the benefit
of others. .

I’m sure the headlines and complaints of stu-
dent apathy will most likely reappear, in fact, I’ll
probably write a few myself. I'm just as confi-
dent Hand-in—Hand and Greek Week festivities
will be forgotten as soon as no one attends an
open forum or public-safety seminar.

But for now, on the record, I think students
deserve to be recognized. Recognized for the
time, energy and effort they gave, not for them-
selves, but for the community, more specifically
for handicapped children who often are left out
of everyday activities. ‘

I'm not advocating ignorance or inactivity
towards campus issues in any way, rather I'n1
asking that we reconsider our perspectives eval-
uating what is important and what constitutes
apathy on campus.

Rather than constantly focusing on student
apathy regarding the “big campus issues,” it’s
timeto at least take note of the interest and
involvement Pitt students have shown in
improving the community as a whole.

Willard dis pl

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

In the middle of the media
iush that followed the hiring of
new Pitt basketball coach Ralph
Willard yesterday, two former
Pitt basketball stars tried to steal
a moment to offer the new
coach their support and good
wishes.

Jason Matthews and Curtis
Aiken approached Willard, and
when Aiken began to introduce
himself, Willard cut him off.

No introductions were need-
ed. Willard quickly let
Aiken know he already remem-
bered the former Panther point
guard.

Then Willard extended a
hand and a greeting to
Matthews. He told both of them
he wanted to “touch base” with
them when he settled in and the
dust settled.

It was a little moment that
points to what some people
down at Western Kentucky
University, where Willard was
the head coach for the last four
seasons, say about Pitt’s’new
main man — he treats people
with respect.

“He treats his kids and his
staff with great respect,” current
Western Kentucky assistant
coach Tom Crean said. “He is a
very demanding coach to play
for and to work for, but you
don’t have any problem doing it
because you know his loyalty is
so great.”

The basketball and foot-

oblivion.

The basketball program is
looking forward to a new
convocation center to play

program sees itself in a
rebuilding effort, with

improvements to its
weight room and study

It is no secret that lack of
athletic facilities at the
University of Pittsburgh has
been a concern for some
time.

Coaches, fans, athletes,
boosters, and some admin-
istration officials have not
been short on words when
talking about how athletic
facilities need upgrading
if Pitt is to recruit and
thus compete with the
other schools on its sched-
ule.

The following is an
excerpt from a confidential
correspondence submitted
by the athletic director to

Calls for facility upgrade

the chancellor:

“It appears from many
points of view that the com-

in the area of physical edu-

Therefore, your indulgence

several problems that exist,
and it is hoped that a good
understanding can be
accomplished to give guid-
ance to the future.

“Again, an obstacle to our
efforts in intercollegiate
athleticshas been the lack
of facilities.”

At first thought, the con-
notation of this letter may
not seem uncanny, if it
were not for one fact.

The letter was written in
February of 1954.

It seems that the athletic
director 40 years ago,
namely T.J. Hamilton, was
concerned with the plight
of this university’s athletic
teams not being provided
with adequate faclities
to compete at the
major—college level —— a
concern all too familiar to
followers of Pitt’s sports
teams today.

Willard’s impending arrival
leaked to the Pittsburgh media,
which tried to meet him at the

Willard referred to the attempt

should say is ‘no comment,’
because that is what I’ve been
saying.”

White Sox to walk to top of Central

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

Baseball has tampered with
tradition and created a third
division, the Central. The
product is perhaps the weak-
est division in baseball. With
the exception of the Chicago
White Sox, the AL Central con-
sists of refugees from the West
and East.

1 1) Chicago White Sox

The 1994 Division
Championship might as well
be served on a silver platter to
the 1993 AL West Champs.

The Sox have the total pack-
age: The 1993 MVP, Cy Young
and the Manager of the Year.
Although Manager Gene
Lamont’s award is arbitrary,
the other two were not. With
MVP Frank Thomas (.316 BA,
41 HR, 128 RBI) in the middle
of the lineup, Chicago will
always score runs.

Robin Ventura is a consistent
hitter who is getting better
each year, not to mention the
fact‘ that he won the last three
Gold Gloves at his position.
Tim Raines is the consummate
leadoff man who hits for aver-
age and has decent power (16
HR). His stealing capabilities
have diminished over __the
years, but that is where speedy
center fielder Lance Johnson
factors in.

The Sox also welcome two
new additions to their lineup.
Julio Franco’s unorthodox
swing might give hitting coach

Walt Hriniak a heart attack, ’

but Franco can hit with the
best of them. Also welcomed
is a rejuvenated Darrin
Jackson to fill the void created

by the departure of Ellis Burks

in right field.

Cy Young winner Jack
McDowell proved why he has
the most wins of any pitcher in
the ‘90s. He.also played an
important role in nurturing the

AL Central
Preview

best young pitching staff in the
AL. Alex Fernandez is a future
Cy Young winner, to go along
with Wilson Alvarez and Jason
Bure to make a tough nucleus.
The only big liability for the
Sox is their bullpen. Roberto
Hernandez is one of the best
clos_ers in the league, but next
to that the pen is barren after
the loss of Scott Radinsky.

2) Cleveland Indians

The Indians are undoubtedly
the team of the future. With
young stars christening their

lineup mixed with some off-
season pickups, Cleveland will
be a definite force in a year ‘or
IWO.

Three players posted MVP
numbers last year for the
Tribe. Albert Belle (.290, 38,
129) was the AL RBI king.
Carlos Baerga became the only
second baseman to have two
straight seasons of at least a
.300 average, 200 hits, 20
homers and 100 RBI. Kenny

Lofton led the majors in stolen ,

bases with 70. He also hit .325
and can cover all fields in cen-
ter.

Mix those stars with the off-
season acquisition of Mr.
Consistency, Eddie Murray,
and budding stars like Triple-A
International League Player of
the Year Jim Thome at third
and outfielder Manny Rameriz
(.340, 31, 115) -— the Tribe
will have their new stadium
rocking.

The only problem is that
opposing teams might feast on
Cleveland’s pitching. Manager
Mike Hargrove has to be con-
cerned about three things.
First, whether or not the aging
acquisitions of Dennis
Martinez and Jack Morris will
hold up and second if Charles
Nagy can become his old self
after having complete shoul-
der surgery.

Last weekend, the Pitt
women’s diving team .sent
two representatives to the
National Diving
Championships. at Indiana
University in Indianapolis,
and the men sent one swim-
mer and one diver respective-
ly to their national competi-
tion at the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis.

Sunday Lewandowski
shined for Pitt by placing
ninth in the one-meter dive,
14th in the three meter, and
10th in the platform-dive
competition. Lewandowski’s
performance was enough to
single—handedly place the Pitt
women ahead of all their Big
East competitors.

Those competitors include

teams like Villanova and the
powerful Miami team, which
did so well at the Big East
Tournament that it forced Pitt
to place fourth.

Her performance earned
her an All-American honor-
able mention for all three
events.

“It was a good feeling. I
knew I could do this well, but
it wasn’t my ultimate best,”
Lewandowski said. “I missed
two dives, but I was still
happy with what I did, and I
hope to do better in future
years.”

On the Inen’s side of things,
rookie diver John Soulakis
also earned himself an honor-
able All-American mention.
Soulakis placed 22nd on the
one meter, 52nd on the three
meter and 11th on the plat-
form. His 11th-place finish in

Pitt divers shine at nationals

the platform dive is what
earned him his honorable
mention.

“I was happy to finish well
on the platform, since my first
two events were not as good,”
Soulakis said.

To qualify for these meets,
both divers had to have quali-
fied on two of the dive
events. At the competition,
however, they perform in all
three events.

“It’s good to give Pitt the
national recognition.that it
deserves,” Soulakis said.

Speaking for the women’s
team, Lewandowski agreed.

“It’s nice to come back after
finishing fourth in the Big
East,” she said.

Both Soulakis and
Lewandowski will be compet-
ing this weekend in hopes of

Tornadoes cut Panther
tmc/e competition sborl

By Keith Pompey
Staff‘ Writer .

This past weekend, the
University of Pittsburgh’s men’s
and women’s track and field
teams found their efforts over-
shadowed by nature.

As the Panthers stood tall at
the seventh annual Alabama
Relays in Tuscaloosa, their domi-
nance was cut short due to a tor-
nado watch.

Pitt was competing only 15

minutes from Piedmont, Ala.’

where the Palm Sunday tornado
collapsed the Goshen United
Methodist church, killing at least
20 people and ‘injuring 90 wor-
shipers.

“Before the tornado watch,
everything was fine, we were
chilling,” first-year performer
Angie Martin said. “Everybody
started acting funny when they
heard of the tornado.”

In the moments preceding the
tornado, the Panthers gave the
rest of the nation a sample of
what to look for during the 1994
outdoor track and field season.
The men and women were both
tied for third place before the
disaster struck.

“One thing that this meet did
do was let everyone in the
nation know that you don’t want
to come anywhere near Pitt in
the hurdles,” assistant women’s
coach Keisha Dumas said. “We
made a statement in what they
can do and the chances they
have of winning the Big East.
And the Penn Relays, oh well.”

In the women’s shuttle hurdle
relay, Pitt delighted the crowd as
they entered not one but two
relay teams in the event. The “A”
relay team that featured senior
captain Kim Blair, grad student
Mary Allison William, All-
American Najuma Fletcher and
junior Staci Suggs ran away from
the competition as they shattered

the meet record with a time of
55.02 seconds. The  relay
team took third with a time
1:00.43.

“We can run a lot better than
that,” Blair said. “The wind was
strong, so going up against the
wind makes you run slower.

“I wasn’t surprised that we
broke the record under the cir-
cumstances. If it was very com-
petitive, we could have ran bet-
ter.”

While Blair wasn’t surprised
about breaking the record, the
crowd at‘Sam Bailey Stadium
was shocked by the extraordi-
nary perfomiance of Fletcher in
the heptathlon.

The sophomore outdueled
Rebecca Gnibe of Virginia by 22
points to break the meet record
with a score of 5,534 points.

The Lady Panthers also shined
in other events.

Williams placed fourth in the
100-meter hurdles with a time of
14.01.

Tonia Malloy overcame
Drake’s Trisha Allen for the
fourth place finish in the 800
meters with a time of 2:11.18.

Joanne Warner, just back from
an injury, took fourth in the
javelin with a throw of 140 feet,
10 inches.

In the 1nen’s events, a group of
young Panthers did the best they
could do.

“Under the circumstances we
did good, matter of fact we did
very, very good,” Pitt men’s
sprinting and hurdling coach
Steve Lewis said.

James Monk led the Panthers
with his fIrst—place finish in shot
put. Monk hurled the shot 53-5
3/4.

In the shuttle-hurdles relay,
Pitt’s foursome of Wes
Alexander, Orrel Green, Jerel

Alexander also ran a personal
best in the 400-meter hurdles
with a time of 52.47, giving the
junior sixth place.

“I felt decent,” Alexander, who
has just come back from an
injury said. “I am trying to get
back to were I was.”

Despite Anthony Dorsett’s
pulled hamstring, the Panther 4
x 100 meter relay team (Dorsett,
Jay Jones, Williams and Dietrich
Jells) showed signs of improve-
mentby finishing fourth with a
time of 41.09 seconds.

“Dorsett pulled up right in
front of Jones, and they just got
the stick off,” Lewis said. “The
second, third and fourth ran
very, very well. Two weeks from
now that same team will run one
second faster.”

“It could be a hard meet,”
Lewandowski said. “We are just
worn out since it is the end of
the season. I just hope to do
well.”

Looking past this coming
weekend, Soulakis’ plans for
the summer are to train up here
at Pitt and to repeat his solid
rookie campaign next season.

“We also hope to represent
[Pitt] in future years at different

Letter

Continued from page 7
qualms in expressing his
thoughts to the chancellor
at that time, Rufus
Fitzgerald.

Hamilton’s complaints
were being aired in an
era before millions and mil-
lions of dolla-rs rode on
success or failure of
football and basketball
teams.

Why were an athletic
director and a chancellor
concerned over 40 years
ago with athletic programs
when they did not have a
prayer in recouping all the
money spent to upkeep
them?

Hamilton answers that
question later in the letter:

“I believe this lack of
pride [with Pitt’s athletic
success] is having wide-
spread effect on the quality
of the work done at the uni-
versity, and the enrollment
is thus cut by the lack of
‘word of mouth’ advertis-
ing.”

A large number of stu-
dents do choose to attend a
certain university because
of its sports teams.Those
teams get the university's
name out to prospective
students.

These people bring
money into the university
that help support programs
and educational opportuni-

ties for all students ——
including students who
could care less about
sports.

There are major expan-
sion plans in the works for
the university, including
additions to Pitt stadium’s
weight rooms and expan-
sion to athletic study facili-
ties. -

On the horizon is a new
convocation center that will
double as a basketball
arena and also free up
Fitzgerald Field House for
enlarged intramural activi-
ties.

Are these improvements
to Pitt’s athletic facilities
deemed necessary just so
the sports teams can post
better records with
no benefit to the univer-
sity’s academic communi-
ty?

That question is best
answered by T .J. Hamilton
once again.

Hamilton said that his
aim was to attempt to better
the relations of the universi-
ty nationally, sectionally,
locally; and to provide
a morale—booster by better-
ing the university’s
sports programs so the
enthusiasm of its fans
would rub off on a great
deal of people -—- whether
those people are sports fans
or not.

3) Kansas City Royals

The George Brett era is over. Time for them to move on.
When you think of the Royals, no superstar comes to mind, but
they are solid at most positions.

Manager Hal McRae is banking on big numbers from his son
Brian, who is emerging as one of the top center ﬁelders in the
game. He is also hoping for Wally Joyner to be the impact he
once was.

The Royals dealt their only power source in Kevin McReynolds
for speedster Vince Coleman. Coleman reportedly has been
making a big bang in spring training.

The Royals’ strong suit is pitching. Kevin Appier was second
in voting for the Cy Young. David Cone is one of the best No. 2
starters in baseball, and they have one of the best finishers in
the game with Jeff Montgomery (45 saves).

4) Minnesota Twins

The Twinkies are past their prime. Kirby Puckett will always
be one of baseball’s best hitters, but he’s aging. Dave Winfield
keeps on going, but he’s aged. Kent Hrbek is still producing
when healthy, but he’s on his last leg. Blue-collar second base-
man Chuck Knoblauch is the only productive youth on the team.

The pitching is filled with should-haves and could-haves, but
for the moment the Twins don’t know what happened to Kevin
T apani and Scott Erickson — who coupled with Jack Morris to
win the 1991 World Series. You never know. Manager Tom
Kelley has been known to make miracles in the past.

5) Milwaukee Brewers

For all those cheese—heads out there, I’m sorry. This team has
nothing that resembles a contender. Therefore, -I won’t waste
your time.

Willard
Continued from page 7
Brooklyn, N.Y., responded by

saying, “Turnover.”

Upon inspecting the outﬁt, he
asked, “Why is it double-XI?”

Pitt also brought out a cake to
celebrate Willard’s birthday,
which was yesterday.

“Oh, that’s why if is double-
XL,” Willard said.

The combination of humor,
respect and winning earned
Willard plenty of fans back in
Bowling Green, Kentucky,
where the Western Kentucky
campus is located.

“We’ve lost our leader,”
Interim Western Kentucky

Athletic Director Jim
Richards told the College
Heights Herald.

“It"s.been amazing, some of
the phone calls that have come
in here today, from kids that
have played for us in the last
four years that are excited for
him,  Crean said yesterday. “I
don’t know if that happens in
every program.” I

Crean and another assistant,
Bobby Jones, would both join
Willard at Pitt if neither one gets
the head coaching job at
Western Kentucky.

“If I don’t stay here, I’m look—.

ing forward to it,” Crean said. “I
wasn’t there [at the press confer-
ence], but I’m sure the people
of Pittsburgh were fired up
today. They have no ideawhat
they have got.

"He is a tremendous coach
and a great human being. He

knows how to win. He knows

how to get kids to reach their,

potential.”

Willard stressed the impor-
tance of developing the individ-
ual skills of the players on his
teams.

“The thing that is going to be
exciting for the player is that he
makes them better,” Crean said.
“He improves people. You have
to be dedicated to play for him.
You have to be  a gym rat.
But if you do that, he gives you
the opportunity to go above
and beyond.”

Willard said that his 18-year-
old son Kevin, who walked on
with the Hilltoppers last season,
has not decided if he will follow
his father to Pitt.

There has been speculation
that other Western Kentucky
players might follow.

“I think all the players are
going to stay right here,”
Western Kentucky senior
Cyphus Bunton said.

In particular, Bunton added
that his roommate Chris
Robinson, who was an all—con—
ference selection for the
Hilltoppers last season as
a sophomore, was going to stay.

Willard insisted that the play-
ers currently at Pitt are part of
his plans.

“The kids in the program right
now are my kids,” Willard said.
“There is not going to be an atti-
tude of, ‘Wait until we get my
kids in the program.”

Willlard said he will instill a

family attitude, the kind of atti-
tude that he had at Western
Kentucky.

“He’s always having the kids
over to his home to watch a
fight on television,” Crean said.
“He realizes that when they are
away from their parents, then
he is the parent.”

Pitt is not the first school to
show interest in hiring Willard
for surrogate-father duties. He
has drawn interest from major
schools like Providence College
this season, the University of
South Carolina last year and
Baylor University two years ago.

“You’ve got one of the hottest
guys there is,” Crean said. “He
deserves everything he gets in
terms of accolades and
job offers.

"He’s a proven winner and he
does it the right way."

Before going to Western
Kentucky in 1990, Willard was
adding to his coaching knowl-
edge as an assistant to Rick
Pitino, first with the New York
Knicks (1987-89) and then at
the University of Kentucky
(1989-90).

He served assistant—coaching
stints at Syracuse (1986-87) and
Hofstra (1984-85).

Willard also coached his
high school alma mater,
St. Dominic High School,.in
Oyster Bay, New York, for 13
seasons.

Willard’s ties to New York p.

could be an edge in Pitt’s ability
to continue to tap the city’s
strong talent pool.

“It won’t hurt,” Willard said. ‘‘I
have great contacts, having
coached high school basketball
in the New York area for 13
years, but I don’t think we are
just going to recruit New York.

“My goal is  when you
mention college basketball, you
mention the University

of Pittsburgh as one of the
national powers. In order to do
that, you have to recruit nation-
ally.” ,

Willard ended his remarks to
the press with a promise.

“There won’t be many dull
moments.” ‘ I I
