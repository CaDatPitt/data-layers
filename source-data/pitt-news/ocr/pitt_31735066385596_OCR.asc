UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
Posvar leads Pitt into decade of international change

By Jenifer Crook
Asst. News Editor

When university President
Wesley Posvar came to Pitt from
an administrative job at the Air
Force Academy in 1967, he
brought along his good friend
Jack Freeman to serve as his
executive assistant. Freeman still
recalls their first day on the job.

“We both walked into his very
large office, which is a little
different now, and he said,
‘Well, Jack, how do you

Point class of 1946, Posvar went
on to become a Rhodes Scholar,
earn a Ph.D. from Harvard, and
teach at both West Point and the
Air Force Academy, where he
founded the school’s political
science department and served
as a test pilot.

And in 1967, Posvar stepped
into the role he still holds:
chancellor of the University of
Pittsburgh. Now, 22 years later,
although the office’s occupant

“I plan to stay as long as I’m
wanted and as long as I want to,”
he said. “There is no deadline or
set schedule, and whenever I
change positions I will just want
to do something else.”

This kind of ambition comes as
no surprise to Freeman.

“He still keeps a schedule that
would keep most people
exhausted, but he seems to thrive
on that type of activity. Even after
22 years he still comes to work
every day with lots of
energy and ready to go.”

that it’s hard because the
university is changing all
the time. And nobody really runs
a university, you just learn how to
get the most out of all the staff,”
said Freeman, who is now
executive vice president.

So who is this Wesley Posvar
anyway? Freeman says that he is
“a very intellectual person with
catholic interests. He is interested
in a number of regional and
international affairs: he is not a
person with a narrow focus.”

Scanning his track record, it
does appear that Posvar is as
diverse a man as the university
that he heads. Holding many

years, Posvar has accomplished

dream of.

has remained the same, little else
about the position has. The title
has changed from chancellor to
president, and these days the job
description is quite a bit different.

“The job has become much
more complex. The budget has
multiplied probably tenfold, and
therefore, it’s necessary much
more now to delegate power,
organize staff and use the latest
management techniques," said
Posvar.

But as complicated as it may
have become over the past few
decades, Posvar’s position .is
clearly one that he still enjoys.
The chief executive spoke with
an edge of determination when
he said he's not yet ready to
throw in the towel.

increasingly apparent
and will have a major
impact on the [United States].

This university is in a strong

position to be a principle actor in

the new global age of
interdependence. Political
barriers have been eliminated,
and trade passes through the
whole European system now.
That’s going to have a big impact
here. ‘International skills are going
to be very important to
Americans.”

As well as viewing it key to
Pitt’s academic growth in coming
years, Posvar also counts
international connections among
the university's greatest successes
of the ‘80s.

“This may be the most
comprehensive and dramatic
growth for an outside observer.

Pitt’s newest fraternity, Phi
Sigma Kappa, has recently broke
tradition by identifying
prospective brothers as associates,
rather than pledges.

“We are trying to lessen the
differences between the
candidates and the brothers. The
name change breaks down the
image of hazing within fraternities
and gradually brings a candidate
into the group so that by the time
the associate becomes a brother,
it’s kind of like the icing on the
cake, ” said Terry Brooks, adviser.

The change was voted on by
all undergraduate brothers and
was approved by 90 percent of
the members.

“It’s a hell of a lot harder for a S

brother to scream, ‘Hey, get over
here associate,’ than it is for them
to say, “Hey pledge, get yourself

over here, ‘ “ said Frank Pizano,
president.

Pizano said that it takes six to
eight weeks for an associate to
become a brother. Associates take
that time to learn about the
fraternity and its history.

“They need that period so that

they can really get to know the

brothers, and so that they can
learn about all of the traditions,”
Pizano said.

Phi Sigma Kappa began as
colony in October 1988. It was
approved by the national
association in one year and
received its charter at a banquet
on Saturday.

“The time during which we
were a colony was so that the
fraternity could prove itself and
[the members could] show
themselves capable of functioning
as a group,” said Pizano.

“We now have 54 brothers and

Jan. 24 —-A staff member stated
that an unidentiﬁed man came
into his U—Ride office at 209
Oakland Ave., and argued with
him about a van parked in the
driveway. The staff member said
that the unidentified man told
him that he was a policeman. The
man shoved the staff member
and told him that if he parked in
the alley again, he would have a
problem. The man threatened to
arrest the staff member. At that
time, he was asked for his police
I.D. The man hesitated and said
that he was a constable.

Jan. 24 — A student at the
William Pitt Union told campus
police that she noticed another
student’s ofﬁce door almost
closed, and she knew that the
other student never left her door
ajar. She opened the door and
saw a young man going through
what she thought looked like a
book bag. She asked the man
what he wanted, and he said that
he was looking for the lady whose

ofﬁce it was. She took the man to
the occupant of the ofﬁce and
pointed her out. The man asked
the office occupant if she was the
English teacher, to which she
said no, and the man left. The
occupant checked her ofﬁce and
found that $30 had been taken
out of her purse.

Jan. 25 — Campus police and
city ﬁre units responded to the
William Pitt Union to check on a
possible fire in the Schenley Cafe
kitchen. Upon arrival, the ﬁre
was determined to be in the

'service—elevator shaft. A pull

station was activated by one
policeman, and another used a
fire extinguisher directed into the
shaft. The ﬁre was caused by a
burning cigarette being dropped
into the shaft and igniting paper.

While the campus’ international
growth accelerates, Posvar said
its expansion here in Oakland is
essentially complete.

“I think that the campus is
where we want it to be. It’s about
twice as large as when I became
president, and it’s become very
stable in size. But we are very
deficient in dormitory space. We
have plans for a major 1,000—bed
dormitory which we hope to start
building next year,” he said.

Throughout the past decade,

Posvar has noted definite changes

‘in the students attending Pitt,

both academically and socially.
“Our applications have gone
up steadily, and we had
admissions fill up earlier with
higher SAT scores than ever this
year,” he said. “As for attitudes, I
think compared to the 1970s,
students are more serious about
their studies and future "careers.

with the classroom studies. I’m
glad to see the students concerned
about their future roles in society,
because that’s why they’re in
college."

Along with its student image,
Posvar feels that Pitt’s image
around the country has also
improved in recent years. .

“A dozen years ago we were
elected to the Association of
American Universities, which is
considered the Top 50 universities
in America. I think one of the
most pleasing reports is that we’ve
been identified as one of the
public Ivy League institutions.
That means we’re very highly
regarded and yet still have public
tuition."

In both past and present times,
ﬁnancial crunches have caused
serious dilemmas. In fact, Posvar
guided the university through its
most crucial monetary crises in
the late 1960s, a move that gained
him high regard. But problems
continue.

“The continuing need to deal

with scarce resources is still our
biggest problem, and tuition has
gone up more than we would
like,” he said.

Posvar’s personal life sounds
as busy as his professional one.
He married his high-school
sweetheart, Mildred Miller, who
also enjoys a ﬂourishing career.
The former opera star now serves
as artistic director of the Pittsburgh
Opera Theater.

Posvar’s diversity also shows
through in his interests, which
include “designing and building
buildings, playing tennis, skiing
and swimming. Mildred and I
also like to tramp around the
woods outside our home in the
country. I’m pretty busy.”

Indeed he is. After receiving a
phone call, the president seems a
bit antsy. When asked if there’s
anything he’d like to add, Posvar
smiles and says, “No, not really.
I’ve got the new coach waiting
outside.” And true to word, right
outside the office stands who
else but Paul Hackett?

Seminar opposes censorship 's banning’ of talent -—

By Jennifer Shusko
For the Pitt News

Activist song writer Anne
Feeney started off the “Speak-
Out” Against Censorship in__the
Arts Seminar with her song which
said, “Don’t say anything about
you—know— what.” She sang to an
audience of over 200 people in
the T eplitz Memorial Courtroom
at the Law School Building on
Friday evening.

Outside the courtroom, tables
of various organizations such as
CRY OUT! and the Socialist
Workers Party were set up.
Between tables a large sheet
decorated as the American flag
was laid out on the ﬂoor for
people to walk on and exercise
their freedom of expression.

Some of the groups that helped
to organize the seminar were the
National Lawyers Guild, the Gay
Rights Organization and the
Socialist\X/orkers Party. Speakers
such as Dennis Brutus, a South
African poet, and Tom Murphy, a
Pennsylvania state representative,
discussed the issue of censorship.

Rick Austill, a founding member
of CRY OUT!, had a slide
presentation showing black-and-
white photographs that had been
banned from display by right-
wing. conservatives. Austill
believes that these conservatives
are anti-gay bigots, and people
such as North Carolina Senator

Jesse Helms hide behind
Christianity to take away a lot of
gay and lesbian rights.

“Helrns’ views would put him
in a racist group, so he uses gay-
rights people to cloak what he is
trying to say about censorship,”
said Austill.

The overriding message of the
speakers at the seminar was that
censorship is banning the talent
behind the work itself. The
government has refused to
federally fund some controversial
art.

Tom Murphy compared the
movie Dead Poets Society with
censorship by equating
romance of ideas and imagination
in the movie to the freedom of
artists.

“Somehow we need to inform
people of content without
prohibiting it,” said Murphy.

Murphy opposes banning
performances, but said he can
tolerate labels on records and
warnings on exhibits that may
have shocking themes.

The master of ceremonies, poet,
journalist and broadcaster Moe
Seager, has had performances
interrupted and art censored. One
year he was asked to withdraw
something he wrote from the
Three Rivers Art Festival because
of “strong language.”

“Now is a time for artists to
come forth and wake up the
country,” exclaimed Seager.

Ret/am/emg U. 5. foreign aid
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole has designed a plan
aimed at responding to the desperate economic needs of
some of the w.orld’sV  ,’ ’derﬁoctacies, V  as
Poland, Hungary, Panama and “countless needy.countries
thatunder current allocations will receive not one penny

» of American aid.” ' . I

/ Dole’s proposal for doing this is to cut 5 percent of the
total aid given to five traditional U.S. allies. The five

. recipients he has targeted “are Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, the

'  Philippines and Turkey. Accordingly, Dole stated that a 5-

: percent cut in the current aid programs of these five
countries would produce about $330 million.

The proposal has met outrage and opposition among
lobby groups for these countries, which apparently seem

_ to be more concerned about minor cuts for themselves

than about advancing freedom and liberty in Eastern

. Europe or Panama.

Many Americans are opposed’ to giving any new aid to
any country (even though an economically strong Eastern

' Europe and Panama would have great economic benefits

forthe United States). But the countries that Dole is aiming
to help are making the type of historical transition from
communism to -capitalism that America has dreamed of in
Eastern Europe ever since the Marshall Plan was first

' enunciated. In fact, one of the premises of that plan was

that the money sent from the‘ United States would allow
the Western European economies. to inevitably blow
away the Eastern ones, leaving Eastern Europe thirsty for

‘free markets and hateful of communism. This has now

transpired, and we must at least furnish the necessary

funds to see this over 40.-year-old goal carried through.
Budget constraints prohibit the United States from

distributing any substantial» amounts of aid to these

, countries. Many congressional Democrats are pressuring

the Bush administration to raise taxes in order to generate
the money needed to aid these countries. But why should
the Bush administration raise taxes in order to help
another country along when the needed money is already
therewith our traditional allies?

We make fiscal adjustments within our own domestic
resources and budgets to help new domestic programs
and others when they are threatened or in crisis, so why

shouldn’t we do the same with our foreign-aid budgets

and policies?
There is no reason why the five specified allies should

receive so much U.S. aid, and the developing countries so

little when they’re the ones that need it most.

In a recent New Yorle Times op-ed piece on the subject,
Dole stated, “To me, it boils down to this: Are big gains
for freedom worth a small cut in a few huge foreign-aid
programs? I say yes.”

So do we.

“Drastic measures..."
Congratulations for writing the
most bigoted, sexist piece I’ve
ever read in The Pitt News. You
remind me of another pi g-headed

columnist, Phil Musick, when

you make a fascist statement and
then deny that it is fascist. It’s
outrageous that the brunt of the
responsibility for the decline of
civilization, as you see it, is placed
on women.
unaware thatmen and their sperm
assist women in becoming preg-
nant? You list all the categories
of incompetency represented in
these’ mothers‘ without applying
any “blame” to all the underage,

drug—addicted, demented, un-

.married, poor, buttheaded

(whatever that means) men out

there who are having sex with

these women. How would you

a ensure that Big Brother’s Minis-

try of Sex awarded reproductive

rights fairly? You clearly don’t .

think much of our present gov-
ernment’s social programs or
abortion laws. If you were truly
interested in enacting social
change, you would volunteer
time and money to the many

groups that, believe it or not, '

have also noticed these prob-
lems that you are ranting about:
Planned Parenthood, PAAR, etc.
How would you feel about hav-
ing some kind of implant in your
penis so you couldn’t get a
woman “illegally” pregnant? Who
do you trust to make decisions

about whether you want chil- C

dren or are ready for them, or are
able to care for them or are
worthy to have them? Not so
great if the one deciding sees
things differently from you. I
really hope you will rethink some
of your reactionary social pro-
grams.'

C.S. Starnton

I am bafﬂed that you would
print a piece as ridiculous and ill-
conceived as Mark Stafs “Drastic

never read a more outrageous,
senseless and poorly researched
essay in my life. Although I doubt
that he seriously thinks that the

his premise that overpopulation.
causes poverty troubles me.

There are’ many causes‘ of
poverty, but I'd like to focus on
the two that I ﬁnd most alarming:
our severely inadequate educa-
tional system and the" fact that
most of the available resourcesin
the country are concentrated in
the hands of a very small number
of people.

Mr. Staf should’ consider that
the liberals in the ’60s and '70s
“improved” our educational sys-

 

tem by loosening its structure,
making it free—form, non—authori—
tarian and goal—oriented. Today
we have public schools graduat-
ing illiterate students.

Even more frightening is the
fact that some 90 percent of the

' wealth in this country is in the

hands of only 10 percent of the

people. Do you know, Mr. Staf, ‘

that one of the largest controllers
of this wealth is the media? Con-
sider the power they have over
what issues we discuss and what
questions we ask. It’s really easy
for them to fog our views with
myths like overpopulation. They
don’t want us to know the wealth
they control and the power they
wield. How long will it be before
we can only read the USA Today?
What angers me is that there is
about as much relevant news
coverage in The Pitt News on our
campus scale, as there is in the
USA Today on a national level.
[...l
Finally, Mr. Staf, you don’t
sound at all like a fascist They
were completely opposed to any
and all forms of birth control. But
“darn it,” you really don’t sound
like a liberal. And incidentally,
we anarchists don’t run around
killing people, nor do we want to
judge whether or not they’re
worthy of having children and
preventing them from doing so if
we think not.

Khaddaﬁ still nuts

I would like to make a couple
of brief comments concerning
Jeff Tatusko’s column, “Military
Successes ...” The Pitt News, Jan."
17. For the most part, the edito-
rial is fair and refreshingly in-
formed on our recent martial
history, but I must disagree on

the point that the U.S. air raid on '

Libya in 1986 has silenced Col.
Khaddaﬁ’s terrorist activities. No
less an authority on the subject
than Oliver North has openly
stated that two British and one
American hostage were executed
in Lebanon by Libya’s military
attache to Damascus, one Major
Halifa. Several weeks later two
Americans were shot in Aden
and Khartoum in more retali-
atory attacks. In just two months
after the air raid on Libya, the
United States experienced 11

‘ terrorist attacks that have been

linked to our friend Moammar by

‘various intelligence sources in

the region. There is also some
speculation that the bombers of
the Pan Am massacre over Scot-'
land have ties to Tripoli. Can we
really say that the air raid has

quieted Col. Khaddaﬁ’s war of '

hate to any degree?

One last point on the subject of
the Libyan air raid deals withthe
manner in which the operation
was conducted. Huge _ numbers
of American aircraft were re-
quired to undertake this mission,
not even including the Air Force
F-111s used to bomb Khaddaﬁ’s
backyard. Needlessly these men
and women (yes, women ﬂew in
some of the tanker planes),-‘were
put in harm’s way simply be-
cause we do not currently have a
strategic bomber with sufficient

. range and defensive electronics
_ to do the job. But we could have

one soon if Congress isn't fooled
into thinking the world has sud-
denly become such a safe place.
Two B-2 “Stealth” bombers with
four crewmen could have easily
done the job that we risked over
100 to accomplish with mixed

' results. '

Homeless...
Orz the scene reporting provides writer with an eye-opertirzg experience

At about 8:30 last Wednesday
night in front of the William Pitt
Union, where a shanty demon-
strating the plight of the home-
less was being displayed, 1, as a
concerned student of the univer-
sity, approached the demonstra-
tors in hopes of learning more
about the homeless situation in
America. As a result of my initial
conversations with some of the
people involved and under the
advisement of my editor, I de-
cided to spend a night at the
union. I went in as an ignorant
reporter with many stereotypical
beliefs pertaining to the home-
less. I felt above the people at the
shanty. By the time I left the next
morning, I was much more in-
formed and actually felt lower
than some of the people I met.

I met Rocky first. He’s been
homeless for 21 years. About 20
of those years were dedicated to
alcohol. Just recently, he’s man-
aged to kick his drinking habit
and is on the road to putting his
life back together. Physically,
he’s not in the position to hold a
permanent job, but he manages
to ﬁnd odd jobs here and there.
He makes enough money to
afford shelter at Wood Street
Commons downtown,’ but one
day, he’d like to ﬁnd a place that
he can call his own.

At first, he didn’t want to talk to
me. Most people who are
homeless, if they’ve been around
as long as Rocky, are pretty
skeptical of strangers, especially
reporters. After I assured him
that my intent was to write an
informative and beneﬁcial article

and not a destructive one, he let
part of his guard down, and we
talked. He actually considers him-
self luckier than a lot of people
because of the fact that he has a
place to sleep at night and food
to eat. How many of us take that
for granted?

There was a handful of stu-
dents around also. Two of them,
graduate student‘ Bill Page and
senior Tracy Darin, stayed all
night. Most of the others stopped
by for a little while, talked to
some demonstrators, made a

donation, and left. Most students -

just walked by. I did get a chance
to talk to Bill and Tracy about
why they were there. They were
simply concerned enough to
make the effort. Bill has been
involved since the
started, and Tracy felt that if she
can help even one person be-
come more aware of what’s going
on, then that’s all that counts.
They were just two people who
cared enough to do what they
could to help their homeless
friends.

Everyone was concerned with
the government. Much of the
campaign was focused on the
fact that the government cut funds
for the homeless, and the dem-
onstrators’ goal was to reinstate

‘the 2 cents per dollar for the

homeless in the national budget.
Although they saw that public
awareness was most important,
they also stressed the need for
more government support.
Lastly, I met Batman and Robin,
or more speciﬁcally, Howard
Brown and Jim Rieger. Howard,

shanties A

of Pittsburgh Housing Now! and
the coordinator of the shanty
campaign, and Jim were home-
less in the past. T hey’ve man-
aged to rebuild their lives and
now dedicate practically their
entire lives to helping the home-
less. I call them Batman and
Robin because at one point in the
evening, as I watched them walk
toward the Cathedral, I didn’t see
them as two ordinary men. I saw
them as two heroes ﬁghting for a
cause that they obsessively be-
lieved in.

 

They were homeless. They
knew a feeling that most of the
people who might take the time
to read this article will hopefully
never know, and if it’s at all
possible, they’ll do anything in
their power to help destroy
homelessness as a problem for

anyone. To them, we are all

brothers and sisters, and we
should react to our natural in-
stincts to help our family when
need be.
The fictional Batman is whole-
heartedly against crime with a
passion. He’s not in it for the
glory. Howard Brown is whole-
heartedly against the existence of
homelessness. He’s also not in it
for the glory. He’s not gaining
any personal benefits from his
actions. Like Jim, he cares. They

believe that affordable housing is
an American right.

Not soon after I met our two
heroes, a villain appeared on the
scene. He arrived in the form of
a drunk student. If his remarks
and actions weren't completely
repulsive, he could have actually
been pathetically funny. (I
thought I was ignorant!)

Howard was sleeping in a box.

to demonstrate what conditions
are like for some people, and the
villain, (we’ll call him Snake),
started kicking the box. He actu-
ally had the nerve to display false
pity by saying things like, “Aw,
we should take this guy home
and give him a place to sleep.”

While his friend was the one
making a donation, Snake con-
tinued to ramble about all the
things he knew about the home-
less, “They could shovel drive-
ways for a living instead of being
no-good bums!’Why don’t they
get jobs?” I guess Snake doesn’t
realize that many homeless
people have jobs. I guess Snake
doesn’t realize that many of these
homeless people with jobs are
also single mothers with chil-
dren.

“If they’re under a roof, then
they’re not homeless.” I guess
Snake never met Rocky, who
doesn’t consider a shelter, where
you’re only welcome at certain
hours, a home.

Luckily, Snake eventually left,
but he served his purpose. He
made me aware of the fact that
some people are uneducated and
rude as hell. 7

Howard pointed out that the

disease of homelessness can at-
tack anybody. “One day you
leave your house at 131 America
Lane, and when you come back,
your house [has] burned down.
Or after you build your life up,
with a good job and a family, the
factory closes, and you lose
everything.” I rarely think about
the fact that this may happen to
me, but if it did, I wouldn’t be too
happy.

All they’re asking for is some
public awareness and govern-
ment support. They don’t expect
the whole world to devote their
lives to the cause. Just a little
educated awareness and maybe
a letter to your congressman
would help. A few minutes of
your time at most.

I guess I learned a lot after
spending a night at the shanty. I
didn’t learn many facts, but

Howard doesn’tbelieve in talk-
ing about facts anyway. He
believes in cause and effect.
“There are many causes, so let's
deal with the effect: homeless-
ness.” I learned that we’re all
human beings, no matter where
we live or don’t live, and that it
doesn’t take much to become
aware of the homeless situation.
It just takes a little time and
interest. If you ever decide to talk
to someone on the streets,
chances are that he’s a pretty
good guy.

I went home that morning, and
like I expected, I did appreciate
the lumpy bed I used to gripe

V about.

A miserable weekend in the dorms with the ﬂu

There is no such thing as a
“good time” to come down with
the ﬂu or a cold. Certainly it is not
advantageous during" the midst of
the school year to have your
temperature sprint past the 100
mark. This past weekend I felt as
if I was on the fringes of getting
the ﬂu, so I decided to stiﬂe it
immediately. Living in the 20th
century I did what any other man
of the '90s would do; I called my
mother.

“Hello, Ma? This is your son.”

“Son? I have no son. Oh, this
must be the one that the gypsies
brought: the one that never calls.”

“Yeah  listen, Ma. I have a
cold or ﬂu or somethin’. Maybe,
you could do me a favor and
crank up the chicken soup.”

“A cold,” she said. “Well, if you
would have listened to me in the
first place and wouldn’t have
played football in the snow  “

“Ma, that was a month and a
half ago!”

“Hey, don’t use that tone of
voice with me, or I’ll tell all your
friends that you still listen to that
song “Da Do Run Run.”
take for granted which you can-
not participate in because of
how you feel. You have a head-
ache, so reading is out, you’re too
tired to venture outside, and sleep-
ing is only pleasurable up to 12
consecutive hours. \

My next—door neighbor Mike
Van Auker just got over having
the ﬂu and, upon witnessing my
condition, offered this sage ad-
vice on being sick, “It is true. The
ﬂu haunted me; it will haunt you.
We all need to be haunted.” I
asked him what this had to do
with my request for two Tylenol
tablets. He just hasn't been the
same ever since he was forced to
read Immanuel Kant.

I thought about going to Stu-
dent Health Services, but I had
such a horrible experience when
I went there last year after bust-

ing my ankle that I thought it
would be a sounder idea to just
decompose in my own room.
As I lay in bed, shivering in
misery with an icebag on my

 

head and an i.v. needle splitting
open a vein, I kept repeating to
myself, “Do you feed a fever and
starve a cold, or is it the other
way around?”
ter, who is a nurse at Children’s
Hospital, and asked, “Mary, do
you feed a fever  ?” but she cut
me off, started to laugh and asked
me if I really liked Shaun Cassidy
singing, “Da Do Run Run.”

I hung up, leered at the Tup-

 

I called my sis- I

perware container of Christmas
cookies. sitting across, from me,
and decided to cowboy. I went
through the two dozen cookies
in about 10 minutes. Roughly 15
minutes later, I discovered that
whatever I had, it would have
been better if I starved it.

Sunday I was feeling a bit
better. My innards were no longer
made of liquid concentrate, and
my friends stopped frying eggs
on my forehead. I still felt as ifl
was ice skating when I attempted
to walk, but I no longer needed
to be within 15 seconds of the
bathroom.

The best part of being sick,
especially when it’s highly con-
tagious, is the revenge which
you can take on your peers. All
of my hallmates who gloated

about my illness will start to regret
it within 12 to 24 hours. It just so
happened that when we went to
dinner, I made the “mistake” of
drinking from their glasses when

they left the table for a few C

moments.

That may have been a callous
thing to do, but the pleasure it
afforded took my mind off my
hallucinations and delirious
mutterings. My friends told me
that on more than one occasion,
when it was past the midnight
hour, and the moon was just
right, I could be heard singing,
“Yeah, my heart stood still, yeah,
her name was Jill, and when she
walked me home, da do run run
run, da do run run."

IFC, Panhell 1990 officers sworn in

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

Inter-Fraternity Council and
Panhellenic officers were sworn
in at an installation service held
in the William Pitt Union on
Thursday evening. ,

After presenting their farewell
speeches, outgoing presidentsjim
Venturella and Missy DeMoss
installed Tony S pinola and Christy
Ifft into their respective offices as
presidents of IFC and Panhel,
respectively.

Ifft then swore in her executive

board consisting of Internal Vice
President Xana ‘Smith, External
Vice President Missy Driebink,
Treasurer Kim Crouse and
Secretary Colleen Higgins.

Ifft told those present that she
was going to use her year in office
to make a difference in Greek life.

“The challenge is not in
recognizing that there are
problems in Greek life; the
challenge is in the confrontation
of the problem,” she said.

Spinola swore in his officers for
the ensuing term: Brent Saunders,
internal vice president; Darin

McMu1len, external vice
president; Kurt Hirschenhofer,
secretary and Kirk Stark, treasurer

In Spinola’s acceptance speech,
he stated that he wants to strive
for a more unified Greek system
because “[Greeksl can accomplish
more as a whole.

“lThe ‘Animal House’ image of
the ’70s] is dying. It is dying
because of us. It is dying because
we are no longer the stereotypical
‘Animal House.’ We have made
our existence justified. Our
existence is not only justified, but
needed."

49ers buck Broncos, 55-10, for 4th Super Bowl win

“We'll show up,” the Denver Broncos
screamed at those who said they had no
chance to upend the 12 1/2 point favorite
San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV.

True to form, the Broncos showed up.
And then they were shot down.

San Francisco quarterbackjoe Montana
riddled the Denver defense for a record-
setting ﬁve touchdown passes and the
49er running game contributed three

more scores as San Francisco rolled over
the Broncos, 55-10, in the Superdome
for their second consecutive and fourth
overall National Football League
championship.

The 49ers tied the Pittsburgh Steelers
for most Super Bowl victories without a
loss, and Montana and his teammates set
single game and career records in nearly
every passing category. Denver also set

a Super Bowl record, losing its fourth
championship contest in as many attempts,
tying Minnesota for that dubious honor. It
was also the Bronco's third Super Bowl
loss in the past four years.

Montana, who was named Most
Valuable Player for the third time in his
four Super Bowls, completed 22 of 29
pass attempts for 297 yards without an
interception. Denver quarterback John

Elway was 10 of 26 for 108 yards and
two interceptions. _

Montana opened the scoring with
10:06 remaining in the first quarter,
hitting Jerry Rice with a 20-yard
touchdown pass. Denver answered with
a David Treadwell field goal 3 1/2'
minutes later. That would be the only
points Denver would score until late in

Pitt holds off Arizona; three Panthers score over 20

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

By the time the ﬁnal buzzer
sounded, the five mainstays of
the Pitt basketball team had done
everything but hip-check the
Arizona Wildcats out of bounds.
Darren Morningstar took care of
that. '

“Our two starting guys got
pushed all over the floor,” said

Broo/ez'n’s
return
adds spark
to lineup

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Rod Brookin missed his first

"couple three—point ﬁeld-goal

attempts in Pitt’s 100-92 victory
over Arizona on Saturday, but
what a feeling when one finally
went in. A big smile appeared on
his face, and he pumped his fist

in celebration.

But Brookin, who saw his first
substantial time since dislocating
his right shoulder in practice on
Jan. 13, admitted he was a little
rusty in the beginning.

“I wasn’t hitting my shots at
first," said Brookin. “But I felt I
wasn’t going to start hitting right
away, and I should get the ball
inside to the guys who could
score. I was trying to aim my
shots at the beginning instead of
just shooting. Then I just started
shooting instead of thinking
about it.”

Brookin gave Arizona Coach
Lute Olson plenty to think about,
scoring 21 points and grabbing
six rebounds. He was also 11-11
from the foul line.

“We watched him in the warm-
up, and it didn't appear that he
was stroking the ball well,” said
Olson. “That was probably the
biggest difference in the game,
because we had figured that we
could help [defensively] off
Darren Momingstar in the high-
post situation and try to get help
on the lobs and down low.”

See Brookin, page 14

Arizona Coach Lute Olson after
the Panthers bulled their way to a
100-92 victory over the 20th-
ranked Wildcats at the Civic Arena
Saturday before a crowd of 14,127
and a national television audience
courtesy of CBS.

Three Panthers —— Jason
Matthews, Brian Shorter and Rod
Brookin — scored 21 or more
points as Pitt improved its record
to 7-10, while the Wildcats, fresh

off Thursday's 68-61 victory over
PAC-10 rival Stanford and a 78-74
upset victory over third—ranked
Oklahoma on Jan. 20, fell to 12-
4.

Arizona’s two starting big men,
Brian Williams and Sean Rooks,
both 6-foot—1 1, were virtually
ineffective, contributing only 15
points and two rebounds, while
Shorter, 6-6, scored 23 points and
grabbed 11 rebounds, and Bobby

Martin added 17 points and nine
rebounds.

“Shorter is as tough on the
block as anybody we’ve played
all year long," said Olson. “If he
gets the ball down on the block,
he’s going to score down there a
very high percentage of the time.

“I don’t think our kids did that
bad a job keeping the ball from
him. Where he killed us was with
second and third efforts. I can’t

imagine anybody his size being
any tougher than he is,” Olson
said.

Shorter pounded the Arizona
defense’ for eight offensive
rebounds and went to the foul
line 14 times, hitting 11 free
throws. “I don’t know how many
of their putbacks were putbacks
with fouls,” Olson said.

“They weren't doing a very

Change
in lineup ,
leads to
Pitt win

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

Men’s swimming coach Dick
Bradshaw gave some people a
chance to swim different events
in the final regular-season meet
of the year. The result was a 166-
77 victory over Villanova.

Joe Kozlina swam the 200-yard
fly open for the first time this
season and took first place, while
teammates Eric Cornell and Kevin

McLaughlin finished second and .

third, respectively. Joe Kozlina
and McLaughlin were also
members of the victorious 400-
relay medley with Tim Adams
and Mike Kozlina. I

Mike Kozlina swam the 100-
freestyle open for the first time in
a while and took first place. He
was also part of both winning
relay teams, with the other one
being the 400-free open with Bill
Folger, Matt Porter and’ Eric
Cornell. “I was ready to swim
today, ” said Kozlina. With the Big
East Championships being two
weeks away, Kozlina prepared
all week as if this were a
championship meet. \

John Sharkey and Michael
Naylor finished ﬁrst and second,
‘respectively in both the 1- and 3-
meter diving events. Naylor, Phil
Cruz and Jacob Bourdeau all
joined Sharkey as invitees to the
NCAA pre-qualifying meet.

Pitt took first place in nine out
of 13. events with their other
victories coming from Eric Daum
(1000 free), Tim Adams (50 free)
and Dave Schepner in the 500
free. Bradshaw was especially .
pleased with the 500- and 1000-
free events in which Pitt took the
first three places in both events.
Russ Stockman of Villanova, who
placed in the ﬁnals at last year’s
Big East Championships, only
came in fourth in each event.

Some of Bradshaw’s lineup
changes were done to see who
will be ﬁlling in spots next season
after the departure of this year’s
seniors. He said sophomores
Porter and Cornell, who were on
the ﬁnal relay team, are doing
real well. I

The Panthers will be off next
week and then will host the Big
East Championships at Trees Pool,
Feb. 8-11. Pitt has won the Big
East all seven years they have
been a member of the conference.
The team is very confident they
will make it eight years in a row.
“Everything is so well balanced,"
said Bradshaw. He feels the battle
for second place will be between
Villanova and Syracuse.

Women's swim team wins close one over Nova

By Jim Lakely
Staff Writer

The women's swimming and
diving team hosted Villanova
on Saturday and set the
groundwork for Pitt’s defense

of the Big East Championship

with a 163-137 victory.

“We were shooting for first
andsecond in the 200-meter
relay, and we got it,” said Coach
David Belowich. Pitt’s first team
of Trina Thames, Karin Masal,
Laure Walczak and Christine
Gallagher won with a time of
1:49.50. Coupled with Sandy
Albright, Laura-Lee Sullivan,
Julie Rocks and Celeste Makiel’s
second-place finish, the first
team put the Wildcats in the
hole early.

One of . Villanova’s
weaknesses is in the backstroke
events. “We wanted to exploit
that and take an early lead,”

said Belowich. The Lady
Panthers did just that with a
clean sweep’ of the 100
backstroke, led by Thames’ time
of 59.13. Albright took second
(1:01.06), and Janine Atiyeh
placed third (1:03.84).

Villanova makes up for its
backstroke problems with very
strong freestyle swimmers.
Theresa Picklo, one of the Big
East’s best distance swimmers,
finished second in the 1,000 free.
Picklo stayed close in the 500
free andlfinished second. Jill
Cameau and M akiel finished third
and fourth, respectively.

In the 200 free, Villanova took
first and second, but Clare
McShane stayed close in a third-
place finish. She has a good
chance to pull off a surprise
upset in the Big East
Championships, according to
Belowich.

Masal and Sullivan proved that

they are two of the best
breaststroke swimmers in the
Eastern United States by ﬁnishing
first and second, respectively, in
the 100 breast. Masal said, “I’m
really pleased with how I swam.
I'm looking to make NCAA cuts
at [the] Big East [Championship]
or at Easterns.” Masal dominated
the 200 breast on her way to
victory.

“She maybe swimming as good
as she ever has here at Pitt,” said
Belowich. “She is peaking at the
right time.”

An interesting situation came
up during the 200 butterfly. Rocks
and Holly Dietrich of Villanova,
both transfers from Maryland,
competed against each other for
the first time. Rocks, who is
suffering from the flu, came in
second with a time of 2:07.76.
Revenge for Rocks came in the
100 butterﬂy when she beat
Dietrich to finish first (58.70).

Rocks has been swimming very
consistently and has a good
chance to make NCAA cuts.
Albright, usually a backstroke
swimmer, showed her
versatility by coming in fourth.
Kara Moxie finished fifth.

In the 50 free, the Wildcats
won again, but Pitt showed its
depth by placing second, third
and fifth. Senior Terri Ziegler,
who ﬁnished fifth, “swam the
best I’ve ever seen her,” said
Belowich. “She does a real
good job.” I

Pittswept both the 1-meter
and the 3-meter diving events.
Donna Flach won the 1-meter
event, and Nicole Bunker won
the 3 meter.

Gallagher was solid all the
way through as she came in for
a second-place finish in the
100 free. McShane finished
third, and Walczak ﬁnished
fifth.

good job boxing out on defense, ”
said Shorter.

The Panthers grabbed 41
rebounds, 19 of them offensive.
Even Brookin, who has been
nursing a dislocated shoulder
since Jan. 10, contributed six
boards. “It helped that he could
score, ” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans,
“but he didn't get six rebounds
most nights with two good arms,
and tonight he did with one.”

The Panthers also displayed an
offensive tenacity that has not
been evident since they scored
100 points in each of their first
two victories of the season. Five
Panthers scored in double ﬁgures.
Their 61 second-half points was
their best second-period effort of
the year, and after struggling at
the free-throw line for most of
the season,’ they hit 39 of 49
shots. '

Brookin, playing his first
extended time since the injury,
made 11 of 11 foul shots and
scored 21 points. Matthews led
the Panthers with 26 points, 20 of
them coming in the second half.
Matthews freed himself for ﬁve
three-pointers in the contest,
including three in the second
half and two during a run in

which the Panthers led 63-61 and
scored eight consecutive points
to take ; 71-61 lead with 8:41
remaining. Pitt’s lead was never
less than ﬁve after that.

Jud Bueohler, who led Arizona
with 28 points and 11 rebounds,
scored nine points in the ﬁnal
eight and a half minutes. Arizona
had four long-range shooters in
the game in the final minutes but
made only 8 of 23 shots from
beyond 19 feet, 9 inches in the
game.

The Panthers led 39-35 at
halftime, as Brookin and Martin
contributed 12 ﬁrst-half points,
and Matthews and Shorter six
apiece.

The win was Pitt’s second in

the past three games with 11
games remaining. “I think it’ll
help our confidence,” said
Shorter. “We’ve been in a slump
lately, and now we realize we

can play with anybody.”

NOTES: Pitt takes on Boston
College, the ninth—place Big East
team, Wednesday at Fitzgerald
Field House at 9 p.m. The game
will be televised nationally by
ESPN, although Pitt chose to have

the game blacked out within 35'

miles of the city.

Spindler
could keep
tradition
alive at Pitt

Should Pitt junior defensive end
Marc Spindler announce that he
is forgoing his ﬁnal season of
eligibility to pursue a professional
football career, he will likely
continue a Pitt tradition that was
in danger of ending this year.

Spindler is likely to declare

himself eligible for the National
Football League sometime this
week, and by all indications will
be a ﬁrst-round draft choice if he
does so. The Panthers have had
a first-round pick every year since
1983.
- Despite a large crop of
graduating seniors, the Panthers
were not expected to have
produced a ﬁrst-round pick this
season. At least 10 Panthers are
expected m be drafted or receive
free-agent tryouts. ‘

Spindler, 6-foot—5 and 270

pounds, was in Kansas City last

week to have his knee examined.
All reports said that it was graded
excellent and would pose no
problems should he go pro.
Spindler was tied for the team
lead in tackles last season with
73. He was angered when Pitt
football coach Paul Hackett ﬁred
defensive line coach Frank
D’Alonzo earlier this year.
D’Alonzo recruited Spindler and
was also one of his best friends.
Another defensive end,
freshman Keith Hamilton, ended
speculation by maintaining that
he would stay at Pitt after saying
that he might transfer. Hamilton,
6—foot-7 and 275 pounds, led the
team in sacks with nine. He was
also recruited and befriended by
D’Alonzo, and Hamilton was also
angered when the diminutive
coach was released from the
university.

Coleman backs attitude with action

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —- Call
Derrick Coleman a “probable”
player. The Syracuse senior
forward will probably be Big
East Player of the Year. He'll
probably be a unanimous All-
American, probably be the first
overall pick in the June NBA
draft, probably be a star in the
NBA. j

Does he feel any strain from
everything expected from him?
No. Basketball isn’t work for
Coleman; it’s fun, and he wants
to keep it that way.

A reporter asked him if he’d
begun to think of what NBA
team he’d like to play for next
year

“\What’s the NBA?” Coleman
asked before bursting out with
a laugh.

Another reporter asked him
what it was like to be mentioned
in the same company as Patrick

Ewing, whose Big East career
rebounding record Coleman
broke Tuesday night against Pitt.

“Patrick who?” he retorted,
again giggling.

On the court Coleman looks
for the alley-oop dunks, the big
block shots, the showtime plays,
the kind of plays that Dick Vitale
can yell, “Ooh, baby,” over.

Coleman only had a couple of
gorilla dunks last Tuesday night
against Pitt, but in the second
half he had four swats and nine
boards, helping Syracuse break
open the game.

But with the Panthers safely
put away and still two minutes
remaining, Coleman began
celebrating early.

Near half court he held the
ball by his hip with one hand
and gesmred with the other
hand to Darren Morningstar,
inviting Morningstar to come
and get him. Morningstar
refused, so Coleman dribbled
the ball between his legs over to

the referee to see if he would
guard him. Nope. So Coleman
just stood there smiling while
30,000 Orange fans went
bananas.

“lMorningstarl was beating me
up inside all game, I just wanted
him to come outside and guard
me. That's all," Coleman said,
smiling.

Coleman had to give, in order,
Tony Scott, Stephen Thompson,
Michael Edwards and finally,
Billy Owens high-fives before
he reached the other end of the
court. The Dome rocked.

His antics may wear a little
thin with his opposition, but at
least one Panther took it in
stride.

“I think if we were in the
same situation, we would have
done the same thing,” Pitt center
Bobby Martin said. “It’s part of
the game. You’ve got to take it,
and if you can take it, you can
dish it out.”

Coleman will end up as

Syracuse's all—time leading
scorer, rebounder and shot
blocker before the season ends.
This after being rumored to
leave early to the NBA since his
sophomore year because of
academic troubles even though
Syracuse hasn’t had an athlete
declared ineligible since  well,
since a long time ago.

Despite his arrogance,
however, Coleman does have a
soft side that comes out —
rarely, but it does.

“But seriously, when they
stopped the game and gave me
the ovation [after breaking the
record], it felt pretty good. It
was nice,” Coleman said without
a gleam in his eye. “I had
forgotten about the [rebound]
record until [Syracuse Sports
Information] told me right before
the game.” if

“He’s not always [arrogant]. ‘

He's a great guy to be around,
and I love him like a brother,”
Scott said.

the Pitt wrestling team.

Simply put, the Panthers are *
_sinking fast.

The 18th-ranked Navy

-Midshipmen scuttled the
Panthers on Sunday, 31-9,

B dropping the inexperienced '

Pitt squad to the murky depths
of a 3-5 season.

“Their experience was
matched against our
inexperience, and it proved to
be too much to overcome,”

said Pitt Coach Rande
Stottlemyer.
The Panthers found

themselves, in an early hole,

  sink Pitt wrestlers

11-0, after losing the first three
matches, but rebounded with
an impressive showing by
senior Alan Utter (142 pounds).
Utter dominated his match,
winning 16-6, and the victory
raised his record to 25-7-1.
The only other Panther win
belonged to sophomore Doug
Johnson (158).

Panther notes: Earlier in the
week, the Panthers lost their
second straight Eastern
Wrestling League meet to
Cleveland State, 21-9.
Stottlemyer credited Bill Lewis
(1779 and Joe Hilferty (190)
with wrestling tough matches.
-Pitt's next match is against
EWL opponent Bloomsburg on
Friday at Fitzgerald : Field
House.

49ers

Continued from page 10
the third quarter, when Elway
scrambled for one yard and dove
for a touchdown. ’

In between thosepoints, the
49ers put on an offensive show
that will not be soon forgotten.

Montana found Brent Jones in
the end zone for a seven-yard
touchdown with :03 remaining
in the first quarter. Mike Cofer
missed the extra point, giving
San Fran a 13-3 lead.

San Francisco fullback T om
Rathman dove into the end zone
for a one-yard touchdown in the
middle of the second quarter,
and Montana and Rice split the
Denver secondary for a 38-yard
touchdown pass with :34
remaining in the first half to give
the 49ers a 27-3 lead at
intermission. I ‘

San Francisco was forced to
punt after a stalled drive in the
opening moments of the third
quarter. On the Broncos ensuing
drive, 49ers linebacker Michael
Walter intercepted an Elway pass
and returned it to the Denver
one-year line. Montana
connected with Rice on the next
play for a touchdown, giving
Rice a record four career Super
Bowl touchdown receptions.

Elway was intercepted again
on the next" drive, this time by
safety Chet Brooks, and John
Taylor, who caught the winning
touchdown pass last year against
Cincinnati, caught a Montana pass

y to give the 49ers a 41—3 lead at

9:44 of the third quarter. It was
Montana’s fifth touchdown pass,
a Super Bowl record.

Bill Romanowski intercepted
Elway in the end zone on the
next drive, but the Denver was
awarded a first and goal from the

one-yard line after Romanowski '

was penalized for interference.
Elway plunged into the end zone
to cap the Bronco scoring.

But the 49ers were not yet
done. Rathman ran three yards
for a touchdown three seconds
into the fourth quarter and tailback
Roger Craig had a one-yard
touchdown run after Danny
Stubbs recovered an Elway
fumble and returned it to the
one-yard line with» 14:00
remaining to play.

Only Cofer’s missed extra point
kept the two teams from tying the
record for most points scored in
a Super Bowl. The Steelers beat
the Dallas ‘Cowboys 35-31 in
Super Bowl XIII. 5

5   Brookin-

Continued from page 10

Morningstar started the game
but was replaced by Brookin less
than three minutes into the game.
Brookin played 27 minutes in the
game to Morningstar’s nine. But
coming off the bench is the role
in which Brookin excels the most.
Last season Brookin was
considered one of the premier
sixth men in the nation.

“Coach [Paul] Evans wants me
to go in there and give a sparkto
the team. Then ﬁne, I'll go in and
try my best to do it. I wasn’t going
to try to rush anything today with
this being my real ﬁrst game
back,” said Brookin.

Brookin was two of six from
three-point land, a dimension to
his game that opponents must be
wary of. “Rod was very important
to us today,” said Pitt forward
Brian Shorter. “Some teams think
they can stop Jason [Matthews]
from shooting the thmes, but Rod
was there -toback him up and hit
threes.” ,

Brookin’s six  rebounds are
what impressed Evans the most.
“We hoped he could score, but

he didn’t get six rebounds when p

he had two good arms,” quipped

Evans. ‘
The shoulder didn’t really affect

his play on Saturday, said Brookin.

‘Right before halftime he tried to

block a shot and overextended
the shoulder, causing it to tighten
up. But the halftime break was
enough to loosen it back up for
the second half. However, foul

Brian Brush and Gilbert Johnson
each played four minutes subbing
for Brookin.

But according to Brookin, Pitt
had another important player on
the Panthers’ side: the fans.
Throughout most of the game,
the 14,127 people in attendance
at the Civic Arena were relatively
quiet. But down the stretch, a
steady roar echoed throughout
the building.

“Pittsburgh fans are the greatest.
They were behind us all the way
from start to finish,” said Brookin.
“They are sticking in there with
us, and hopefully they'll continue

to do that, because we need

them. They're like a sixth man
out on the court."

Another intangible factor in the
game was the national CBS
audience. Pitt is now 2-0 this year
when being televised on CBS,
including last Saturday’s 63-61
victory over Seton Hall. Despite
that, Brookin would rather not
play in front of a national
audience.

“It takes the pressure off when
you’re not playing on CBS
because if you have a bad game,
your friends back home can’t see
it.”

Brookin would have made his
friends proud on Saturday.

I R trouble kept Brookin on the bench ~ *
I for 11 minutes of the second half.
