Bowl-Off Fails

Harris Miller and Steve Cun-

ﬁr dra. the two combatants in the

/A inconclusive Student Govern-
ment election. attempted to set-
tle the still-raging issue with

a head to head bowling match-

last Saturday night. The victor
was’ to have been named SG
President. but the results of the
bowl—off are being hotly disput-
ed by both parties.
"The bowlioff was necessary.”

er’s manager.” since no one
knew exactly where he stood.
Bowling. of course. is hardly a
significant criterion for election.
but apparently, neither is get-
ting more votes then the oppo-
sition." . T
K .. Cundra strode into the Strand
 alleys shortly after midnight.
.nattily attired in a gold King
Louie bowling shirt with “Stev-
ie” written in silver‘ sequins ac-
ross the_back. Miller. arriving
ten minutes later than his foe.
was clad in a grimy blue work
shirt. "Har” was penciled in
barely visible letters across his
chest. Miller apologized for his

tardiness, relating that he ‘had -

'been caught unawares and need-
ed the extra time to dirty up a
shirt-"

Cundra and Miller agreed to a
one game, winner take all format.
’* Adler and John Cavaluchy, ‘Cun-
dra’s manager and erstwhile ele-
vator operator, acted as pin-set-
ters. Cundra won the coin" toss,
stepped up to the approach,
and launched an eleven-step de-
livery that propelled him half-
way down the alley. '

-While the crowd laughed, the
injured ;Cundra conferred with
his manager. "I can’t throw that
heavy thing" by myself. "whis-
pered Cundra.-The clever Cav-
aluchy scanned the faces in the
audience and spotted grid’ star

in Ralph’s hand and taunted.
"I’ll bet you can't knock those

Cundra fainted. but was quickly.
revived. and the match contin-
ued.

Burdened by the weight of the’
ball, Cundra was forced" to go
over the foul line repeatedly and
to little avail. Time after time,
he dipped into the pocket, only
to come up short. Miller, bowl-
ing steadily if unspectacularly,
rolled to an 83-68 victory.

Despite his apparent win.
Miller was denied the presiden-
cy by the Student Government
Elections Committee. which
ruled that an anemic total of 83
pins was not worthy of that
office. The SGEC was strongly
influenced by the whining and
crying of Cavaluchy and Cun-
dra, leading _the disgruntled
Miller to remark that he” . 
had won the bowling match but
lost the bawling match."

In the rematch ordered by the
SGEC. Cundra defeated the de-
moralized Miller. 72-65 and was
awarded the presidency. Adler
protested. saying that Cundra
had illegally overstepped the

foul line. The SGEC ‘decided.

however, that since Cundra‘s

fouls had gone ‘-unprotested in
the first game, they were per-
fectly legal thereafter.

That should ' have ended all

controversy. But an ‘alert Pitt ‘

series of H shots showing pin-
setter ' Cavaluchy kicking over
pins for Cundra. This most re-
cent revelation muddied -the is-

Due to inclement weather. the Spring Riot has been postponed.

SIR MICHAEL EDELSTEIN

Many moons ago. before even
the advent of other institutiona-
lized forms of exhibitionism and
voyeurism.‘ there dwelled in the
town of Pittzborg a highbrow
vassal who sold numbers tickets
on the side. termed by- all the
Chance. Seller. At least. legend
has it that his name thus be-
came so. despite rumors that he
really supplied local TV sta-
tions with Charlie Chan movies
and in that way became known
as the Chan Seller. '

KING RAYMOND Ia Chaffer of Har-
risborg in the process of signing the
College of Pittzborg’s appropriation
bill. He was heard to comment,
‘‘I’m as pleased as punch to be here
in Pittaborg . . .

Whatever the truth may be-
the Chance Seller once ruled
king .over his mighty land. rising
magnificent structures verily
unto the smog clouds. Especially
to be noted. the Cathedral of
Leaning. made so by a giant

searching for prey (and thus the
saying. “That's the sway the Bald

pounces.") But as his overhead.

grew lower. Calling upon his

friend Merlin the Magician.
at his home named Merlin
Squire. Chance called upon

Merlin to produce long promised
funds. but Merline refused unless
he. was to be allowed to make
the revered College of Pittzborg
disappear and pull from his mor-
tor board a new College bearing
the name Merlin College. Chance
thought the probability high that
further appendanges might be
so attached to the deal enough
to render it an albatross about
the neck or a. pain generally»
elsewhere.

Twas at this very same time
that a stated relation and king
of regions from a far entered the
picture bestriding. his noble
steed.’ Tax Wagon. Hitching the
abhorred beast to the College of
Pittzborg. ‘ King Raymond / la
Chaffer of. Harrisborg. after a

forth and drum beat fifth. "Hear

installed with doors which turn

Coup Usiirps Power

byBOB GING ” '

/ News Editor ‘
This weekend, while Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar was vacation-
ing in Africa. one of the most-

amazing and swift changes of
administration

in ' college his-
tory took place at the University
of Pittsburgh. A, coup detat. led
by Jack Freeman, (for so long
Dr. Posvar‘s right hand man.)
and backed by many of the
more liberal or conservative stu-
dents on, campus (usurped the
powers that be, and set them-
selves up‘ asa Coalition admin-
istration. "

Asked how the "coup came
about. Freeman referred the
News Pitt to his spokesman and
tactician Frank Donatelli. Dona-
telli stated that he and his gang
had decided that the adminis-

tration was predjudice and gave ‘

unfair advantages to left wing
radicals. He approached Free-
man-with the idea of a coup,
and’ Freeman, seeing his chance
to "stand in the spot light, was
quick to buy it.

Donatelli enlightened us as to
some of the problems that faced
the coup group. He explained,
"Ourhardest task in achieving
the coup was to win over Edison‘

Tonight should have been the

that we start the riot. They readi-
ly agreed.

Panty-Riot A Toss-Up 

for her to open her window and
throw an item of underwear out.
We would scream loudly. fight
over the garment. and the spring
riot would be catharsized.

Unfortunately, AIice’s room
borders Fifth Ave., not the quad-
rangle. As a result, when she toss-

‘ ed her underwear out the window,

rather than landing in the waiting
arms of George and me, it sailed
lazily out onto Fifth Ave., landing
on the head of a motorcycling
member of the Tactless Police
Farce.‘ -

Realizing her mistake. Alice
borrowed someone else's under-

.wear. ran into the room of a frined
’ and threw the underwear out the

window. High above our heads the
wind puffed the blooming. billow-

ing cloud of cotton. Gracefully it’

sailed down through the stratos-
phere. P .

I- was the first to sight it..Shov-

’ing George aside. I raced toward
the spot screaming. "Underwear. '

George chimedin. . _

I grabbed them at full run.
evading the tackle of 12 Pitt
men. But when I turned to trium-
phantly face them. there was no
one there. Except George. I did
notice one guy standing passively
b_v yawning. And a couple was
making out‘ in the corner. We had
failed.

Alice dropped a string, and we
were able to return the panties to

her. we waited a few minutes, and

then she again dropped the pan-
ties. Down came the prize,. sailing 
softly in the breeze. “Here comes
the underwear,” I screamed at a
volumeeasily discernible in the
Towers.

"Spring riot has begun." shout-
ed George. -A

"All the girls are throwing their
underwear," I added. .

_"‘How exciting,” said George
from beneath the flowered pan-
ties that had landed on his head.

Suddenly we sensed hundreds

Paris Watch Out:

Legmen Organize

Paris fashion designer, long
the dictators of skirt lengths,
may be in for trouble. Legmen
around the world are organiz-
ing. Soon the designers may
have to clear their proposed
skirt lengths with the Interna-
tional Council of Legmen be-
fore their new collections ever
go to market.

Sound unlikely?
Not if the worlds legmenghave
their way. The International

Council of Legmen. a dedicated
group of gam aficionados. has just
been formed in New York City.
One of its aims is to establish a
“unified voice on fashion deci-
sions relating to female leg ex-
posuref’

Barry V. Conforte, spokesman
for the Council, believes that de-
signers are paying too little atten-
tion to legmen. “We’re going to
change this situation, even if it
takes some high pressure lobby-
ing with the designers,” he said.

Mr. Conforte reports that the
Council doesn't endorse any par-
ticular skirt length. mini. maxi or
midi . . . all are in the news and
all flatter a pair of beautiful legs.

“We don,twant to see any par-—
ticular skirt length go the way the
dodo bird—even the maxi." he

said. “We want a return to nor-
malcy. The constant fluctuation in
skirt lengths creates problems
for the gals. and they interrupt
our legwatching patterns. The
women shouldn't be forced into
wearing one particular skirt
length. whch may or may not flat-
ter them. They should have com-
plete flexibility and freedom to
choose their own shirt lenghts. ac-

- cording to their fashion mood.

This gives us more variety too.
and makes our legwatching all the
more fun." ‘

What do the women think? Ma-
ria Marzan, female consultant to
the Council, believes that a radi-
cal move to the maxi could create
long term problems.

"From the feminine point of
view the mini was terrific. Men
started focusing on our legs. and
we loved it. If we see a blind rush
to the maxi. male interest will
wane. and their eyes will go else-
where. Each gal should be free to
choose skirt lengths that flatter
her most!

The Legmen’s Council activi-
ities. sponsored by Roman Stripe
Hosiery. will be responsive to
general developments in fashion.
According to Mr. Conforte. “Hem-
lines are one of our primary con-
cerns. but our efforts won’t be
limited to this one area."

. Students Tops
, Across Country

After the news last week that the State Department on the
information provided by a special Committee, called “All Stu-
‘dent Sacrifiées.Aiding South Asians Are Needed Soon” (ASSA-
T SAANS), had chosen the Pitt Student as “the best trained poten-
tial soldier in the country,” many students flooded the Univer-
sity Thymes with queries as to why they had received such an
« honor.

After each person on the staff had been checked by the
State Department and all Jewish, Black, and WASP-types-turn-
ed-freaks had been kicked off, they enumerated the reasons why
the Pitt Student had been singled out.

Lester Maddog explained to us that no where in the country
did students have the stomachs that Pitt Students had. He said,
“the very fact that your medical complex is not filled after every
. meal with students needing Exlax’s and Enemas. or suffering
from the dry heaves, is an uncanny circumstance.” Mr. Maddog,
a veteran of ,Viet Nam and otherlittle overplayed "differences of
opinion between the United States and foreign countries. and a
K-ration-eater from way back, explained the committee came to
_ its conclusion about Pitt stomachs after eating lunch in Tower C

_ cafeteria. Maddog told the University Thymes that the committee
was not certain, at first, about the idea that Pitt Students who
ate cafeteria food were masochists, but were thoroughly convinc-
ed after one extremely old member of the committee dropped a
fried potato from his fork into his lap; fracturing both his hips.

and throwing his spine out of place. “Anyone who can eat this
mess,” Maddog exclaimed “can surely eat the worst Army cook's
T meals, and probably come back for seconds.” 

Richard Daily of Chicago, commented that Pitt students
have to have the fastest reflexes in the country. He arrived at his
opinion after carefully studying students trying to get from the
Student Union to the Cathedral, from the Student Union to the
Common Facilities building, and from the Cathedral to Clapp
Hall. “Many students resemble super Gayle Sayers. in the way
they lithely and deftly avoid vehicles, seemingly hell—bent on
their destruction,” Daily said, “and the students who aren't on
crutches are even faster. He commented that watching students
going back and forth to classes across Forbes, and Fifth was like
going to a “bull fight.” Daily said that the U.S. armed services
had no physical training that could compare with the type got-
ten on the University streets. He had been reluctant to-make that’

‘last statement, but found himself duty bound to whisper it from
his hospital bed; where he ended up today because the matador
_ skills that he had received in the Army where not quite enough.
‘ to get him completely out of the way of. a charging Mack Truck
on Bigelow and Fifth, as he tried to get from the Cathedral to
the Student Union. '

“Never have I seen such perserverance and will power,”
little Spiro Agold, the hand puppet of Dr. Dickybird Nixoff. Dr.
' » Nixoff gets his jollies by seemingly having the puppet say any-
thing that he wants to say himself, or in other words “passing
the muck”. Little Spiro was of course speaking of the tenacity
that many Pitt students had which caused them to sit through
their classes day after day, without so much as raising their
hand to scratch their heads. '

ASSASAANS will present every student with a little button
saying: “My Country Right or Wrong at mass meeting tomorrow.
After the meeting a mock riot will be held, but weaponry will be

a limited to mortars, m-14s bayonets and policy tactical riot sticks.
The last student left standing will receive an all expense paid,
‘ four year visit, to Viet-Nam. ‘

The Left

by D.D. IRVING
Undercover Agent
Special to The Pitt News

It’s -a do-what-you—want gen-
eration. ‘

Be a Captain America with
long hair. A reefer here. and a
reefer there. Fight the fight

that’s never been won. To be
yourself in a world that tries to
make you everybody else can be
done. It’s .just that the answer
isn’t written on the wall.

JOHN_ ACAVALUCHY looking at the
flag, ‘‘I don’t like him,” D. C. Irving.

There are no ifs and buts in
freedom. There is no together-

dom in‘ that. Live in your own
skin. See the light. Watch the
light not reveal . . . . .

The answer is undercover;
that: is. under covers. Take off
your goddam clothes, get under
covers. and close both eyes. Make
all of the time Alice in Wonder-
land time. Be the first Rip Van
Winkle on your block. Aren’t
you hip. to time? -

A man has but one life to live.
One life to do what’s possible
to do. or to try to do what can’t
be done. On the one hand I ask:
If I have but one life. should I
not do what I want‘? And I ans-
wer: Yes. On the other hand I
ask: What if I can’t do what I
want’? And I answer: Shit!

"Eliminate Frustration." I say.

‘So I try. But even thatfs frus-
trating.

..In my frustration. I'm strong.
I stand alone. Or rather. I lie.
On a bed. I have butone life,
and so I try to do what I want.
Not worried about what others
might think. I'm not lazy. But
having one life. I choose to sleep
it away. 
Sleep. by definition. impeach-
es Richard Nixon. Sleep silences
the majority. Sleep puts an end
to unnatural deaths. And causes.
Like war. Sleep reduces tension.
and eliminates grades. instead
of visa versa. Sleep allows The
American Dream.

Sleep is what I want. A chosen
profession as a compromise to be
career oriented. I‘ am willing to
be called lazy._ Subversive. A
bum. A communist. Baffoon. You
nameit. If I sleep tight. I will
_not hear those fascists.

Yes. it‘s a do-what-you-want
generation. Or so it has been
said. Do what you want. a fight
that's never been won. But it
can be. In a bed. or in a couch.
On a chair. or on the floor. Up
against a door. Rain’ or shine.
Day or night. Under covers.
orjust in clothes. With only this
body of mine.

I hope to people that thirst.
or hunger. or ill health. or rest-

lessness. Does not wake me up.

by JOHN DOE
Special to the Pitt News

The far left and the far right
have been widely written about.
commented upon. criticized and
defended. Now it is time to

. speak in behalf of the people in

the middle. the great silent ma-
jority.

The silent majority has been
so silent that. until recently. its
existence was unknown to the
majority of the people in the
United States.

However, now that the spot-
light has been focused upon
the middle of the readers, I feel
obligated to speak in their de-
fense, as I find myself a mem-
ber of this vast throng.

We are silent because we are

content with the way things
stand. ‘

e We have no organizations.
no marches. protests. or causes

to march for or protest against.

The majority of our members

are not outspoken about their

membership in our group.

'ness in vanity. A vain man is . ' 
socialized. and there’s no free-.

JOSEPH BARR holding on'for dear
life. “He’s my hero,” John Doe.

When things» go ‘well, we are
content. When things go wrong
we are still content and confi-
dentin our leaders.

Though we are not exactly a
sensitive barometer of social un-

_ rest, we do influence the forma-

tion of most of the foreign and
domestic policies of this country.

The main question in the
minds of our leaders as they
make theirvdecisions is. “What
will the Silent Majority say
about this?"

Though‘ we are called wishy-
washy by the far left andvright
groups, we do not hold this
opinion of ourselves. \

The left feels that a change is
needed in our society. They are
of the opinion that our way of’
life. our morals. our government
and our most sacred institutions
are outdated and irrelavant. They’
have no faith in Our God or Our
Country.

The right. on the other hand.
is too“ afraid of change. They be-
lieve that our system is the best
possible. '

They are of the opinion That
reasonable change. can be achiev-
ed through the system. Howev-
er, they are too confined by
tradition, too stifled by morality
and too constricted by religion.

..The silent majority strongly
adheres to an opposite opin-
ion. However. it is not consis-
tent with our principles to

by SPIRO WELSH
Special to The Pitt News

With the ascendancy of the
vicious New Left. and their ob-
steperous over use of violent.
communistic rhetoric. its nice
to know that the people of the
United States. can sleep safely
at nights. -knowing that the
loyal. communist fighting right
wing is on their side.

If one thinks back over time.
it is plain to‘ see that our great
nation. founded on the precepts
of freedom and liberty for all.
would never have reached the
great heights that it so easily
reaches were it not for the tire-
less work of the dedicated right
wing. .

The truth is. however. that
there must be someway of keep-
ing tabs on the goings on of
those who wish to other things
than salute the flag and defend
our country in time of war.

One can even see that the reds
are trying to keep the Supreme
court to themselves. If there’s
anything that ‘makes a Commie
plain as day its the fact .that
they absolutely refuse to share,

But in an attempt to clean up

the "hotbeds" of Communism the ,

right has to embark on a program
of self 4 defense. If they don’t
have the arms to defend them-
selves. then the whole Wing
might just go to pot, —

It is therefore- necessary to
stockpile caches. of weapons
wherever possible. And when the
day comes that the Commies
try to take over. they’ll be

met. with the feircest resistance
theyever saw!

  

Georr BAUMAN “lighting up." I“:
don’t like him,” Spiro Welch.

_These dedicated men and wo-
men 'and children too (you nev-
er ‘can start too young) believe
in peace, but only if its to our
benefit; they believe in non-vio-
lence, but only if violence isn’t
needed. And what better morals
could be found in the alienated,
drug ‘using, free-love, pot-smok-
ing, loose living, pornography
reading and hypocritical mem-
bers of the “flower-child” gen-
eration.

And to answer those who say
-we need sex education in the
public schools. it is only neces-
sary to say. "weVshouldn’t teach
the kidshow its, we should teach\
them how it’ ought to be! "

The minority can do whatever I

they want! (Provided they stay
in_ their place.) And besides,
what’s good for most of us
should be good for all of us. If
they don’t like it here, why the
hell don’t they leave?

So. to all our white. angio-
saxon. prostestant friends who
think that the New Left is going
to sneak up‘ of them while
they're safe and warm in their
beds. just rememberthat you
have a friend who's constantly
watching you.

They‘ll get what‘s coming to,

them from all the god-fe’aring,k:‘.1 A

Editor. The Pitt News:

On the surface. the financial
problems of the University of
Pittsburgh are over. As students.
faculty and members of the ad-
ministration. we can be proud of
the common effort we produced in
order to allay the crisis.

It was remarkable to see Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar stand with
citizens of the student body. who
in the past has been relentless in
their criticism of himand unite
beautifully with a common goal.
Bearded and crew-cutted engi-
neer and philosopher, all banded
together. ’

But we must not delude our-
selves that the future holds no
more. problems; the University
continues to be in debt and consi-

A dering the magnitude of the inter-

est rates levied on the official
“borrowers,” we have a lot to

-worry about.

Chances are good that tuition
will be raised significantly, a sit-
uation that may contribute to the
decisions of many students not to

attend Pitt.

In the name of community
harmony and benevolence, I sug-
gest that all students with Univer-
sity and state scholarships and
loans formally renounce them
with the suggestion that the funds
be channeled into University bud-

get. -

Those interested can contact

my office within the week.

and a person thoroughly commit-
ted to” the cause, I pledge my serv-
ices in the compilation work.

A Pill-Cup
Cathedral

Editor. The Pitt News:

I just woke up and I thought of
something very interesting that I
thought you might like to know
about!

I’ve found a way to save the
University from a financial
crisis!

After sleeping for awhile, I be-
gan to dream about the cathedral.
And then it came to me! The ca-
thedral looks like a collapsible
thing, sort of like one of those little
cups that you carry around in your

pocket when you have to take pills

regularly. _

Wel-1. why not just remove those
poles, or whatever, and just col-
lapse the the cathedral, slowly,
until it’s only one story tall.

. Just think!

No more costly elevators. no
more heating pipes that have to
carry hot air up 38 stories. no
more steps to clean, no more win-
dows to clean, etc. Why having the
cathedral which was only one
story tall, would save the univer-
sity millions, upon millions of
dollars a year!

And would also save the jani-
tors the job of cleaning all those
steps and windows. Everyone
would benefit.

I was kinda worried at first
about telling you about, it, but
then I thought what better place to
get publicity than The Pitt News.
Besides you’d never laugh at me.
You never laugh at anything. -*

Johnny The Tike""' ’

L Legendary Man

Like the old calvary horse. an old man must someday face the day
when he is no longer a vivid memory to his contemporaries.
I To alleviate such a dreadful fate. this reporter was dispatched to
a snow-covered mountain peak in Appalachia's Connellsville area to
speak to a former hero. Johnny the Tike.

This lengendary man. Johnny
the Tike, once led Pitt to a victori-
ous football season. Such a state-
ment may seem ridiculously fic-

" titious. but ones ancestors could

verify the facts.

Today the Tike’s growl has mel-
lowed and his smile has brighten-
ed. Upon my arrival, the Tike hob-

. bled out of his cabin, pointed a
rifle, and holler-
ed into his fog-

horn, “Who goe ,

 

Immediately. ,
I w a v e d m y

Panther pen-
nant. The Tike  ,
then tossed his
coonskin cap to- THE "KE
L ward the heavens and screamed.
"Howdy!"

The Tike’s wife staggered from
the Outhouse. leaped across a
ditch «half-filled with empty whis-
key bottles». and then tied my
Pitt News mule behind the cabin.
(Note: In the old days before
state—relatedness. writers used
horses.» '

The tike was only too happy to
be interviewed. However, he in-
sisted that——in order to receive a
story—I accompany him into the
woods. He thrust an axe into my

. hand and we proceeded to chip _

firewood.

Once we were settled back in
the cabin. I realized that Johnny
was the same gentle person that
he had been when he had worn the
golden “P" upon his chest and
Cardiac Hil-l had been his domain.

"I figure I can make something
of myself up her_e. Golly. I've got
more firends now than I ever had
before." Johnny remarked as he
kicked off his moccasins. spread
his toes apart. and peeled a big
dirty scab off the underside of his
big toe.

The Tike blurted a series of un-'

connected phrases concerning his
old timers. As he mentioned
names like Bodle, Borghetti, Lee-
son, and Cunningham, I became a
bit wheezy, even dizzy.

However. when the Tike stuck
his pipe into his red-and-black-
checkered vest pocket, I again felt
somewhat down-to-earth. “I've
been trying _some new pipe tobac-
co. Best dang stuff I ever had!"
he snickered.

Finally. when his youngest boy
dragged in a freshly-killed pos-
sum our conversation ended. and
I hopped on my mule and ram-
bled down to the distant confines
of Oakland.

Someday soon a relative of the
Tike (Prince Carl) might climb

For Annual 500-Mile Classic

by CLAUDE HOPPER

Coach Jim Banners track squad
has been invited to participate in
the Annual Daytona Beach Clas-
sic. in which many of the top
speedsters in the nation will com-
pete.

Though most of the contestants
will be driving stock cars. Banner
doesn't feel handicaped.

"We don‘t mind giving them a
fighting chance.“ he stated mod-
estly. "Mike Schirko and Jerry
Richey will provide all the speed
we'll need."

Since most of his men ran cross-
country, the coach is certain that
the grueling distance will not
hamper his men.

"Five hundred miles is nothing

for our boys." he remarked. “We
have to speed up our pitt stops
though. We still take too much
time to change shoes.

The team will also enter a_num—

ber of field events. The main
event will be the broad jump. The
jumpers performed well in last
years‘ meet. with the exception of
one who was injured when the
broad became indignant.

In other events, Stan Wodowz-
ski is expected to take top honors
in the pole vault.

The high jump is another event
which the team dominated last
year.

“Some of our boys can get pret-
ty high." remarked Banner. The
thin clads are expected to excell
in the shot put. as Pitt students
can put away more shots than
most people.

Traclc Squad Invited to Daytona ’

 

LAST YEAR'S action in the Daytona Classic race. Jim Banner’s trackster’s
have been invited to this year's competition, despite their absence last
time. The thinclads didn't compete then, because of the unusual number

of “pitt” stops.

\ Sidewalk Will Pave Way For

by KIRBE C. MENT

With the addition of Tom Side-

for next fall. the list now has
climbed to 249. Sidewalk. who
is the cousin of James Street of
Texas. weighs 200 pounds at5‘4"

Among his highschool honors.
Sidewalk was all county. and also
won the all neighborhood trophy
for being the best player on the
block in Nome. Alaska. He also
earned Big  honors (one of
the “33" ‘players on the squad for
the Nome High Iceboxes. 1

"It wasn’t easy to get Tom."
said Coach Carl DePasqua. "He
had about two more offers to con-
sider besides us." It wasn’t easy
to put Sidewalk in Pitt‘s pocket-
book either. "They offered my dad
a job as a janitor as well as one
for my cuz with the Steelers."
said Sidewalk. "I wasn‘t going to
give my services away for practi-
cally nothing. ’
