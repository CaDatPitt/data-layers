Pitt Cops Terrned Racist

BY BILL MOORE

Campus police have been
harassing members of the black
community, black students and
personnel, a group of black leaders
charged last week.

Speaking at a press conference at
the Pittsburgh NAACP headquar-
ters, Assistant to the Dean of
Admissions Chentis Pettigrew Jr.
said he had been taken to campus

police headquarters last March for
' “stealing my own car.” Pettigrew

said police officers confronted him
in the parking garage where he
normally parks his car, frisked him,
handcuffed him and took him to
Varsity Hall. “I was intimidated
and embarassed by the whole
incident," the Pitt official said.

Pettigrew, NAACP local presi-
dent Leon Howard, Gloria Patter-
son of the American Friends
Service Committee and Executive
Director of Black Catholic Minis-
tries Bob Pitts accused the
University of harassing blacks on
and off campus, macing black
youths unjustiﬁably, hiring police
officers with past records of
“harassment and brutality of

students” and demanding identiﬁ-_

cation of only blacks on university
property.

Pitt alumnus Carlos Miyares said
that on January 12 of this year he
was arrested in the Student Union
for trespassing, even though he
had a University tI.D. and. was
visiting the University on business.

BAS Concert Requests

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Funds for a Black Week
concert and a Black Action Society
(BAS) spring concert were rejected
at Thursday's Student Government
Board (SGB) appeals hearing when
the Board voted to turn the
requests back to the Allocations
Committee for further review.

The Allocations Committee re-
commendation, which suggested

qr\..BAS and Student Government’s

‘Programming Committee co-pro-

duce the concerts, was turned back
by the Board after four hours of
debate between Board members
and six of the 25 BAS members in
attendance. ‘

Allocations originally recommen-
ded funds for the Black Week
concert be allotted to Programming
Committee although BAS would
choose the group. The recom-
mendation also called for funds for
a spring concert to be placed in the
Programming budget, and for the
groups to co-produce the concert.

At the appeals meeting, BAS
members were permitted to give
a 30-minute presentation explain-
ing their appeal of the recommen-
dations. Normally, groups appeal-
ing Allocations recommendations
do not have the opportunity to give
a presentation and are only
permitted to answer questions from
the Board.

BAS members claimed the Board
would not adequately understand
their position without an oral
presentation.

During a question and answer
session with Board members, and
throughout the presentation, BAS
members expressed opposition to
efforts by the Allocations Commit-
tee to have BAS work with

‘Programming.

“To compromise on this issue
would be placing us in a situation

where we could be compromising

‘Returned to Allocations

the needs of black students,” BAS
Chairperson Kevin Cooper said.

According to Cooper, the BAS
Programming Committee usually
polls black students to ﬁnd out
which groups they would like to
hear.

The Allocations recommendation
was part of an overall move by the
committee to provide a more
consistent programming policy,
according to Allocations member
Carol Thomas. She also said it was
an attempt to get both organizati-
ons to work together.

In the presentation to the SGB,
BAS member Bernie Payne said,
“Due to the inproportionate
number of black student represen-
tatives on the Programming Com-
mittee, we feel it is impossible for
black students to have equal input
upon the decision-making of the
committee."

In a cover letter for the BAs
appeal to the Board, BAS claimed
the recommendations supporting
mutual action for the groups wold
“serve the purpose of eliminating
the BAS Programming Committee,
a vital component in the total
operation of BAS."

BAS co-chairperson Doug Gluy
said BAS is also “expressing a
concern that this recommendation
was not presented to us in a more
negotiable fashion."

Guy charged the recommenda-
tion was not thoroughly examined
in terms of who would be
responsible for contracting and
negotiating with the group, and
who would be responsible for the
shows’ technical arrangements.

Programming Committee Chair-
man Bill Lureye also said Program-
ming would be unwilling to
co-produce the two concerts as
outlined in the recommendations.

According,to SGB President

Barry Weisband, Allocations mem- I
'(.'orztinuedJ_an-l;’age_Z) ., __ __ .

Miyares said he had to spendfa
night in jail for trespassing and

“disorderly conduct.

The black leaders acknowledged
the committees which the univer-
sity has" set up to review the
charges, but claimed the commit-

tees were ineffective and stacked
.against the black community. They

were also highly critical of campus
police Chief Curt Graham, charg-
ing poor supervision is the major
reason for the campus police
problems.

An ofﬁcial University response
pointed out the ad hoc task force ‘
formed by Chancellor
Posvar to review the situation and
make recommendations. The task
force, chaired by Dr. Barbara
Shore, professor of Social Work-
and director of the Doctoral
Program in the School of Social
Work, has sent a letter to black

Group Forfeits Ballot Position   .

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

It will be a choice between one
particular union or no union for
Pitt’s non-teaching professional
(NTP) when the date is set for the
NTP labor election scheduled to’
take place sometime this year.

The American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Em-
ployees (AFSCME) forfeited its
spot on any NTP ballot by failing to
appear at a pre-election confer-
ence, according to Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board (PLRB)
hearing examiner Sidney Law-
rence. ‘

With AF SCME’s forfeit, the field
consists of the Pennsylvania‘ State
Education Association (PSEA) afﬁl-
iate and the “No Representative”
option.

The situaiton is similar to the
recent support personnel elections
in which AFSCME attempted to
have its name removed from
balloting. The PLRB ruled the
request came too late and
AFSCME remained on the ballot,
netting 69 votes. ,

AFSCME’s exclusion from the
ballot was thefonly development in
yesterday’s pre-election confer-
ence, called to tag a date on a Pitt
NTP labor election. The Univer-
sity’s failure to provide an
eligibility list to the PSEA affiliate
resulted in postponement for the
hearings until Augsut 23, accord-
ing to Lawrence. On that date
attorneys will try to hammer out
agreements on election-related
matters such as eligibility, polling
places and other balloting proced-
ures.

In other union news, hearings an
unfair labor practice charges
against Pitt will be held in the
PLRB's Pittsburgh office, accord-
ing to PLRB spokesman Robert
Trump.

Parking Ticket Fines
Continue '75 Trend

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

Parking tickets amounting to
approximately $12,000 were hand-
ed out last year by the Campus
Police force and totals for the first

four months of this year are
about the same_ as last year's,
according to Pitt Campus Police
Chief Curt Graham. -

University police have the
authority to ticket illegally parked
cars in university parking lots only,

and landing three sharp rights.
The round was the challenger’s
best.

Ali knocked Dunn three times in
the fourth round, the first time with
a right-hand lead. The Englishman
went to his knees and then rose at
the count of nine. Ali blasted Dunn
with a right to the head that sent

.him staggering and knocked him

down for the second time with a
right to the head.

Dunn was up again quickly, but
went down for a third time from
another right, and the referee
counted to nine.

City Players’ Production

 j‘“Tuesday" Mimes City Life

BY DAVID ASHLEY

Marcel Marceau has said of mime
that it is “the art of expressing
feelings by attitudes and not a
means of expressing words through
gestures.” Abstracted, yet purely
human, mime, probably more.than
any other art, holds the mirror up
to nature. When exercised with
skill and imagination, few forms of

{jgxpression are more poignant.

The City Players’ production

I of “Tuesday” at the Allegheny

Community Theatre portrays and
parodies aspects of the inner life of
city habitants. Richly varied
enough to be reminiscent of as
disjunct a pair of inﬂuences as
“Under Milk Wood” and, on the
other hand, comic-strip literature,
“Tuesday,” created and directed

by Carnegie-Mellon professor Jew-
el Walker, is full of dramatic
surprises and so well paced that it
never drags. ,

The set consists of four adjacent
doors facing the audience.
Through, around and before
these, the inhabitants and passers-
by of this mythical street go about
their business. Hardhats and
white-collar workers alike tread
reluctantly to work; a trafﬁc cop
directs, or rather conducts, an
imaginary ﬂow of traffic with an
elan that could be matched only by
the indefatigable Snoopy; the local
wino is momentarily saved by the
Salvation Army; a father watches

his daughter courted for the first‘

time and we feel his sudden
awareness. of her maturing inde-
pendence.

There is an impressive rhythm and

. ‘('70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

  Eagerness or Racism?

Oakland is a strange place. Vvithin a few square miles, it contains
museums and classrooms; mansions and slums; art galleries and
hamburger havens. It is Pittsburgh’s cultural center, and at the same
time it is a  area. In the middle of all this is the University of
Pittsburgh. Pitt draws from both worlds. It receives the beneﬁts of
being situated in a cultural center; and much of the crime from the
surrounding area spills over into the Pitt campus.

Because of this, the University has _ a need for a competent,
professional police force that can operate in a high-crime area, as well
as a campus environment. Last week, representatives of the local black
community raised questions about the professionalism of the campus

police when they accused the police force of harrassing black students,
black Pittsburgh residents and black University personnel. 4
Since most campus crime is, in fact, committed by people not
associated with the University, it is understandable the campus police
are eager to keep unauthorized persons off University property. In
some cases, such as when they detained a black administrator for
i1'ying,_to steal his own car, they weretoo eager. At least, we hope it
was just that: eagerness and not racism. ,

In any event, the charges against the campus police" should be
investigated as quickly as possible. If some oﬁicers are guilty of
misconduct, they should be dealt with harshly. And if, as we hope, the

.campus police are wrongly accused, they should be shown to be
innocent as soon as possible so that they may operate with out the
 7 , stigma of racism hindering their performance. '

Those with jobs downtown know
the click of high heels, the “ ‘Scuse
me, ‘scuse _me," the jostling at bus

Men and women scurry along the

glitter-strewn sidewalks without

ever glancing at the trees in Mellon
Park or the fountain at the Point.
The other day, a man followed
one bustling crowd of people near
the Bell Telephone building.
His head was bare, the wisps of
light brown hair curling over his

I ears. He wore a green fatigue

jacket over dusty brown pants.

He wore thin socks with gaping
holes in the heels. Plastic thongs,
the five and ten kind, secured the
socks on his feet. _

He could have been a mill
worker, except for his feet.

The striking thing about the
man, however, were his eyes. They
were like Jack Nicholson's in “One

‘Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."

The man’s eyes were like bits of
glass that sent light twisting in
-several directions at once. They
darted and withdrew, then boldly

 stared straight ahead.

I Those eyes pierced the backs of
the people walking in front of him.
He followed them silently for

_several minutes, his lips twisting

occasionally. Then he yelled and
waved his arms, scaring a flock of
pigeons off the sidewalk.

‘_‘I_{“T1‘Yv hurry. hurry! Don’t wait
to join the human race! We’re all a

bunch of clowns. ha; just look at '

us!”

The woman nearest to him
jumped in alarm, and hurriedly
crossedthe street. Two men behind
him exchanged glances, and

' slowed to widen the distance. The

man yelled again, as Nicholson did
when he tried to put some life_ ir_i_t_o_.
the inmates of a mental institution.

“Whoooeee! Just look at us, will
you! Whoooo! We're all crazy,
know that?”

An old lady who probably hadn’t
even heard him clearly clutched her
purse against her chest and stared
at the street light on the corner, as
if ‘willing it to change so she could
get away from this man. ‘

The man slapped his sandals
hard against the sidewalk and shut
up. He crossed the street, oblivious
to the rush-hour trafﬁc bearing
down on him. He reached the other
side without ever having paused,
and walked further down the
boulevard.

The people who had heard him
kept walking, too. No one said
anything. Several boarded buses
on the corner. Everyone hurried.
No one looked at another.

Those who have seen Nicholson
in “Cuckoo's Nest," may know
what I'm talking about.

A person ‘with’ a bit of life scares
other people.

s

. have we heard these words as we sat back to watch

 the exploits of a band of 23rd century Wanderers.
‘E And yet, how often have we stopped to reﬂect on the

truth contained in them?» Space is_ indeed our last
frontier, one that will never be closed. It stands
timeless and majestic, challenging us to break loose
' from the bonds of gravity and soar unfettered among
the stars. It is the ultimate test of our
resourcefulness and humanity, holding the key to
many of our earthbound problems. Unfortunately,

our nation has for the most part refused to listen to its -

plaintive call, choosing instead to turn inward on
itself, burrowing its head in the sand of the third
planet. Indeed, history may yet prove this to be our
most fatal error as a people. _ -

Our space program has already yielded beneﬁts far
beyond any initial expectations. Monitoring systems
originally designed for astronauts are now used in
hospitals, saving hundreds of lives each year.
Various plastics and alloys developed for our
spacecraft have been translated for everyday use and
have revolutionized such vital processes as food
packaging and preservation. The telecomputer and
communications industries have also advanced at
anamazing rate due to space-related technology.
Meterologists routinely rely on reports from weather
satellites for their forecasts, something unknown
only a decade ago. And although they may not be
able to predict the sudden shower which spoils an
occasional picnic, they are able to track potentially
dangerous weather patterns such as hurricanes and
typhons, providing sufficient warning to prevent
massive losses of lives and property.

Satellites also are used to monitor potential crop
blights and forest ﬁres, and some scientists believe
that by keeping an eye on fault lines from space we
may ‘soon be able to predict devastating earthquakes.
And even- though we may not wish to think about it,
we are protected day and night from a surprise
nuclear attack by virture of the so-called “spy
staellites” which are in perpetual vigilance of Soviet
military installations. There are many more benefits
of the space program which we take for granted, too
numerous to mention, but our greatest harvest is yet

to be reaped. _ _ _ _ _
The reaches which await us just in this solar

system are almost beyond belief. Vast quantities of
important ores and minerals lie dormant and unused
on the moon and Mars, vitally needed on earth
because of our shrinking reserves. The asteroid belt
as ‘well is a veritable treasure trove of natural
resources. One might think these are forever
doomed to be beyond our reach, but in astronomical
terms they are a mere stone’s throw away.

Space may also prove to be the solution for other
ecological problems. The “energy crisis,” which, by
the way, is still with us, could be dealt with by chains
of orbiting satellites which would collect sunlight far‘
better than anything possible on earth and then beam
this solar energy to earth via microwaves. Nuclear
power plants also might be orbited to beam down
their energy in the same way, silencing the safety
critics once and for all. Industrial pollution could be

‘ dealt with in a similar manner. By placing basic

industrial factories in orbit, they would get unlimites

supplies of energy from the sun and vast quantities of
raw materials from the moon at a fraction of what it
would cost if brought from the earth because of the
lower gravity. Our cities would then be cleaner
places in which to live and raise our children. And

should our population ever become a problem, as ’
some doomsayerspredict, we could begin to colonize _

the nearer planets, and ultimately the stars.

Only by going beyond ourselves can we_ realize our
true potential.
Western man; to break loose rather than turn inward,
to free the spirit rather than enslave it. But we will
never do this completely unless we ﬁnd the resolveto
do so within ourselves. Our ﬁnal destiny awaits us
among the stars. Just like our ancestors, we must
meet the challenge of the “ﬁnal frontier" and in
doing so. enter the Golden Age.

Guest Column

Faculty

Radical change planned for the
University senate cuts signiﬁcantly
finto the opportunities of student
and staff at Pitt to participate in
university “governance.” Anybody
who carefully reads the report by
the faculty ad hoc committee on
governance will notice that the
proposed Faculty Assembly (FA)
would not be “coequal” to
University Council. This is in spite
of what chairperson Norman
Austern would have us believe in a
recent letter to this paper. The fact
is that FA would be autonomous
and have primacy over Council,

, especially in its relation to the
7 .a'nlVeI‘Slty bureaucracy.

Since the preliminary report of

other nonfaculty members» in
Council would be further curtailed.
They could not be ofﬁcers or
Chairpersons of standing Senate
committees. Contrary to current
practice these functions would be
reserved for FA members.
Secondly, Council in toto is
disempowered. Its functions are
taken over by the exclusive Faculty
Assembly. Council with its student
members is relegated, at best, to
being a debating club.

If a faculty assembly has the
purpose of giving to the faculty
rights already possessed by other
parties in, the Senate, then one
might expect that there would be
some correspondence between the‘
role of existing student and
administrative bodies and that

Assembly Considered

proposed for the faculty. _
Graduate students, for instance,
would have a Graduate and
Professional Student Assembly
(GPSA) that would be part of the
University Senate, and the ofﬁcers
of GPSA would be ofﬁcers of the
University Council. GPSA would
refer speciﬁc tasks to Senate
committees and would receive their
reports as well as autorize their
publication in the Senate Gazette.
GPSA would “recommend policy

on matters that effect the quality ,

and welfare of the university” and
“chairmen of standing committees
(would be) ex ofﬁcio members of”
GPSA, i.e., standing committees

.would be chaired by male graduate

students. The Chancellor would
regularly report to GPSA, as would

 

other administrative oﬁcers when-,
ever they consider changes in
certain predeﬁned areas. , GPSA-
resolutions would be published in
the Gazette and if a resolution is
addressed to a particular admi-.
nistrator, he would be required to
inform GPSA of the actions taken in
response. GPSA might send its
resolutions to Council for general
discussion. Graduate student _
members of Council could virtually
veto its deliberations by requesting
to take the issue back to GPSA.

Andy Warhol

BY MREA CSORBA
Andy Warhol once said we
have arrived at the age of “ﬂash
fame.” Each of us, he said, can
claim a moment in spotlight-but

'only’for ﬁfteen minutes. The rest

of the world, according to Warhol,
is catching up to the fast-paced
exchange typical of Hollywood
which allows stars but a brief ﬂash,
then trades them in for the newest
of public whim. (Burt Reynolds, I
hear, is on the out, while Margaux
Hemingway is trying to ‘catch all
the rays before her fade-out.)

In the pop art world this theory of
brief illumination seems especially
true. Where are all the superstar

' pop artists of yesteryear? Most of

them are still peddling their
breakthrough pieces of ten years
ago, but they now do it in
obscurity. Remember Clay Olden-
burgh’s “Soft” series? His plastic
typewriter that couldn’t stand up to

-- the experienced peck of a secre-

tary’s ﬁnger? Or his soft toilet that
would fold under the lightest
derriere? When was the last time
you read Roy Lichstehstein’s
mechanically produced take-offs on
heartthrob cartoon episodes?
Intriguing pieces of the licentious
’60s, these are now faded from
public consciousness.

But Andy Warhol was wrong

about his own impact. He—the .

boldest, the most versatile, the
most audacious of the ’60s art

crop-—is still very much in the

public ‘eye.

Perhaps it was his astounding
audacity that attached him so
ﬁrmly to us. He stamped out rows
of monotonously repetitive Coca-

Vtized, Coke-drugged society.

' I hadn’t heard much of Andy
Warhol as painter since“the start of
this decade. (Discounting, of
course, his frequent appearances
on Time’s society pages mingling
with the current vogue people.)
But, though other pop artists have
fallen by the wayside, if Warhol is
the classic we believe him to be, he
should be able to surmount the
changes of public sentiment and
ride with the current movement's
tide.

So thought I, and during last
term’s break decided to drop in on
our famed ex-Pittsburgher to
evaluate his staying power. I found
him at the “Factory,” his Union‘
Square emporium from which ﬂows
his monthly “Warhol’s Interview”.

Interview is the show-biz
jet-setters’ gossip page which
Warhol edits and graces with taped
luncheon chats with the Big
Apples” biggest apples, (Goldie
Hawn, Ginger Rodgers, _Gore
Vidal) The “Factory” also doubles
(quadruples?) as Warhol’s ofﬁce,
studio and apartment. It was there
that I was reassured of Warhol’s
ability to override the changing
tide. ,

The reassurance took the form of
a ﬁnished portrait whose coming
had been much heralded by the
press. A portrait swap between
two of America’s foremost artists
has been arranged, the stories
said, in which Warhol was to do'a
painting of Jamie Wyeth, the
painter-son of the’ famous Ameri-
can artist, Andrew Wyeth. In turn,
Wyeth was to do one of Warhol.
Well, there before me, sitting on
the ﬂoor of _Warhol’s huge, bare
ofﬁce, leaning against the wall
were, not one, but three freshly

dried acriyllics of the younger‘

Wyeth.

They were straight portrait
paintings with all the familiar
Warhol anecdotes screened out. .
There was not a trace of the
garrishness that marked many of
his billboard images of popular
culture in the past. In fact...dare I
say it...Warhol has ﬁnally let slip
sensitivity into his work. In the
three works Wyeth is portrayed as
a refined, handsome gentleman,
posed with hand under chin as if for
a sophisticated, classical album
cover. _ '

The three works are of the same
photograph, the only difference in
them is the different combinations
of ﬂat pastel colors. Warhol used on
the silk-screen image. The most
exceptional one has a green
background with Wyeth painted in
a delicate plum tone. Warhol is
studiously careless with his brush.

The technique gives a
three-dimensional effect as if
Warhol is suspending an incredibly
tight balance between photograph,
painting and collage a few inches
off the canvas. '

Without question, Warhol is an
artist who has not entered the wane
of his artistry. Though no longer
the vanguard of the artistic
movement, he demonstrates ability
to keep in touch with the change of
sentiment, integrating it honestly
with his own personal develop-
ment. But, oh yes, there are signs
the old .Warhol is (not completely
buried. Warhol is currently
working on a ﬁlm entitled “Bad,”
which he says should be good.-

Vivid WesternDrcimo

BY M. PATRICK M0_NAHAN
When a movie has two Oscar-

' winning actors as its stars, plenty is

expected and hype inevitable. But

once, the hype and hoopla is knifed

through, the movie must stand on
its own. “Missouri Breaks” does.

This brutal, realistic western
stars two of Hollywood’s illustrious
name actors, Marlon Brando and
Jack Nicholson. Both are superb in
their roles, and this, coupled with a

time-tested plot (men hired to kill .

other men), make for vivid owestern
drama.

Set in the Missouri territory of
the 1870's, Brando portrays Lee
Clayton, a sadistic Bohemian
regulator, hired by Braxton, a rich
cattle baron, to kill a gang of
‘rustlers headed by Tom Nolan
(Nicholson). The rustlers are
seeking revenge for Braxton’s
cold-blooded hanging (no trial or
jury) of one of its members.

The rustlers rob a train to get
enough money for a farm, which
they then use as an honest front for
their outlaw activity. Waiting‘ for
the proper moment to rob the cattle
baron, four of the members go
north of the border to steal horses
from the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. All except Nicholson. -He's
left alonepwith the gardening and
the cattle baron’s horny daughter.

Newcomer Kathleen Lloyd turns
in a sparkling performance in this
pivotal role. Torn between the
grimy Nicholson and her power-
crazed father, she supplies rich-
bitch snottines and, at times,
believable compassion.

About half way through the film,
Brando makeshis first appearance
on screen and immediately starts to
harrass Nicholson and feel out the

gang's operation. When the gang

ﬁnally returns from the unsuc-

cessful Canadian trip, Brando turns-

into a one-man execution squad.
His cold-blooded slaughtering of
gang members sets the mood for
the rest of the film.“ The youthful
Todd (Randy Quaid) is drowned
while crossing the Missouri River.
Three other members are done in

at even more bizarre locals. One is _
blown away in a poverty-stricken .

mining town's outhouse; another

while in the grasps of a meek.

farmer's wife; the third ina ﬁre set

While Brando is cruelly mocking

Dean Stanton), a twist of irony sets

in. Brando asks Stanton, “Wher ‘V

is Tom Nolan?” Cal points to the
blazing inferno before receiving a
well-placed hunting spike through
the nose. Thinking all the dirty
work is done, Brando relaxes for a
warm evening by the campﬁre.
Tension and audience disgust
build. Did Nicholson die in the
ﬁre? Is a diabolical stinker like
Brando going to get away with this
treachery?
, To the relief of the audience,
Nicholson turns up alive. With
Brando resting contently, thinking
he had done Nicholson in, the
screen goes blank for several

~ ‘T

seconds. When the picture returns;:_‘,

the audience is rewarded with a
ghastly eye-bulging closeup of the
demented Brando. Blood is

gushing richly and fully from his
mouth; suffering liked a gored pig.
, soon he'll be dead. Nicholson has
just cut his throat.

The villian Brando creates in his
portrayal of Lee Clayton makes
other western-badman portrayals

(Lee Marvin in “The Man Whd

Shot Liberty Valance“, and Jack

g Palance in “Shane" come to mind)

look ﬂimsy and gentle.

But Nicholson is no slouch of an
actor, either. As Nolan, he
effectively shows compassion for
his fallen comrades, intense rage
for both Branco' and the cattle
baron and a weird sense of ethics.

The final showdown is with‘
Braxton. Nicholson storms up to
the cattle rancher’s den with
intentions of murder. When he
sees‘ how far off the deep end
Braxton is (all his ranch hands have
quit, his ranch and mind are in a
shambles), Nicholson decides to
take off with his daughter instead.

Candyman Loses To Expos, 4-  

‘ BY GARY MIHOCES
AP Sports Writer

Tim Foli and Barry Foote hit
ﬁfth-inning home runs to lead the
Montreal Expos to a 4-2 victory

over the Pittsburgh Pirates last

night.

Foli’s homer, his fourth of the
season, came on Pirates pitcher
John Candelaria’s ﬁrst pitch after
he yielded a lead-off walk to Larry
Parrish. ‘

One out later, Foote hit his ﬁrst
homer of the year over the same
section of the left ﬁeld wall that
Foli”s shot cleared. o
A That staked the Expos to a 3-2

sixth in support of Woodie Fryman,
who raised his record to 6-2 with
eighth-inning relief help from Fred
Scherman.

“Candelaria was giving us a lot
of fast balls, and we just happened
to get two home runs off him,”
Foote said.

Fryman allowed the only two
Pirates runs in the second inning
on a pair of walks and three
singles. He held the Pirates hitless
over the next four innings before.
giving up a double in the seventh
and giving way to Scherman.

“I always had a soft spot for this
club—until we play against each
other,” Fryman said. “Then they
try to kill me and I try to get the
best of them.” Fryman, who
pitched on only three-days rest, left
the game after seven innings due to

a stiff shoulder. “He pitched the '

last three or four innings with just

guts,” said Foote, his catcher.’

The Pirates two-run, third-inning
spurt began with two outs when
Bob Robertson and Manny Sanguil-
len drew consecutive walks.

Tommy Helms then bounced a
single up the middle to score
Robertson before Candelaria beat
out an inﬁeld single that loaded the
bases.

  What Price Stadiums?  

BY TERRY KIRKPATRICK
Associated Press

The super stadiums of big time
sports in America are raising voices

;/‘\and tempers again this spring.

. p _‘p--

In Seattle, the Kingdome was
dedicated more than a year late

with a price tag $27 million over the 1

original estimate.

In New York, the facelifted
Yankee Stadium was unveiled, with
cost estimates ranging up to $50
million above initial projections.

And in . New Orleans, state
ofﬁcials learned that the Louisiana
Superdome would require $4
million more than appropriated for
expenses in its ﬁrst eight months of
o eration.

“I've had it up to my ears,” said
Kevin Reilly, a state legislator and

member of . the Superdome’s
commission. - ~
Reilly is chairman of the

appropriations committee of the
Louisiana House of Representa-
tives, which will‘be asked this
month to provide, $23.1 million for
operating costs and debt payments

for the stadium over the next year. __

Heated debate is expected. _V
Some legislators say the "Super-
dome’s public support extends only
30 miles from its home in New
Orleans.

“Public projects tend to generate
controversy in proportion to their
size and visibility,” the Arthur D.
Little management consulting firm

v/"".of Boston said this month in its

Nona

/‘F“V‘)

“\,

‘summary report on the Super-
dome’s management.

“Because the Superdome is very
large and very visible, it was
almost a foregone conclusion that it
would have been controversial,
even if its start-up had been
smooth and its financial perfor-
mance promising.”

Start-up was
smooth.

Promoters of what was billed as
the world’s largest indoor stadium

other stadiums were soon to
encounter: cost estimates render-
ed useless by inﬂation and design
changes, the opening delayed by
bad weatherand labor troubles and
ofﬁcial probes of misconduct.

The Superdome started a decade
ago when voters approved a $34
million rival to Houston’s Astro-
dome. Later, when the project

’ began, it was necessary to issue

$137.7 million in bonds to ﬁnance
it.
Adding tax and investment
revenues, the costrose to $_163.3
million. And other estimates have
gone as high as $178.3 million,
depending on what it counted and
who does the counting.

The King County Domed Stad-
ium in Seattle was approved by
voters in 1968 and $40 million in
bonds were issued in 1972. The
cost later jumped to_$67 million.

The ‘original cost estimate in
1964 for Veterans Stadium in
Philadelphia was $25 million.
When construction started in 1967,
the city had to ﬂoat a $42.7 million
bond issue.

The cost projection in 1971 for
the Yankee Stadium facelifting was
$24 million. The official price tag
letter was set at about $45 million.

But estimates of the ﬁnal cost
have ranged between $75 million
and $100 million.

The rising costs of labor‘ and
building materials were two rea-
sons the stadiums ended up costing
far more than projected.

Ofﬁcials in Seattle say construc-
tion costs soared 59 per cent after
the project was bid in 1972.

In San Francisco, an expansion
of Candlestick Park, com-pleted in
1972, cost $24 million. Construc-
tion of the stadium itself 12 years
earlier had cost $15 million.

Design changes along the way
added to the cost of the Harrv S.

City. The complex, completed in
1973, has a baseball stadium for
the Royals and a football stadium
for the Chiefs.

Jackson County voters
approved $43 million in bonds in
1967. Later, it was necessary to
issue an additional $13 million. The
Chiefs and Royals wanted such
items as computerized scoreboard,
fancy viewing and dining clubs,
and a spectacular water fountain.

The Chiefs ended up underwrit-
ing $4.5 million of the bonds, and it
is estimated that they put $10
million of their own money into the
project. The Royals spent an
estimated $9 million of their
money.

Four elevators left out of original
blueprints forthe Superdome were
later found to A be necessary and
contributed $8.2 million to the cost
overrun.

And a grand jury investigating

cost overruns in the construction of

Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia
said it had evidence of “extortion
and bribery and aiconspiracy to
cheat and defraud” the" city.

The jury said it found delays in
construction give taxpayers “less
than their money’s worth and
result in the stadium being built at
substantial variance from the plans
and speciﬁcations.”

The jury said’ changes in
structural supports cost an extra
$150,000 and that hydrants that
should have cost $72,000 were left
out of the original plans. They cost
$211,000 when ﬁnally installed.

No indictments resulted from the
jury’s investigation, and _no indict-
ments have been returned in New
Orleans, where a special legislative
committee and four grand juries
asked questions about the Super-
dome.

Hockey Complaints  
To Be Put “On Ice’’

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

It seems everyone has been bad-mouthing hockey lately. Even in
this column, you have seen some cutting remarks.

But if you get right down to it, as the vice-president of the National
Hockey League mentioned in a recent issue of Sports Illustrated,
hockey has some impressive credentials.

It has no drug users, gamblers, or, aside from a few guys who drop .

their gloves and raise their sticks, no shady characters as does football,
especially, and other sports.

Hockey is relatively free from scandal, and even when an -irate
Montreal fan stole the Stanley Cup from a display case in Chicago
Stadium its fans have been, for the most part,_well-behaved and loyal.
‘ Montreal fans live and die with “Les Habitants,” believing the

Stanley Cup belongs with their team and no other. They are also the 

most knowledgeable and critical, sitting through a game at the Forum
as one might sit through an opera.

Overall, hockey fans everywhere must be the most knowledgeable

fans. After all, if you go into a hockey arena deaf, dumb and blind, all - ‘

the enjoyment is lost. So, hockey fans come to the games prepared,
unlike baseball’s partisans, who sit with popcorn in one hand and a hot

dog in the other, interested more in the kids around them and the view ' A

one gets from the stadium than the action on the ﬁeld.

If the action in hockey doesn’t keep you on the edge of your seat,
those hard rubber disks richocheting into the stands will. And, of
course, everyone likes to see a little blood spilled once in a while, too.

There have been cases of fan unrest within hockey, such as the
swiping of the Cup, so I am not saying they are totally pure. Fans have
been known" to litter the ice and attack visiting players in the runways,

‘ but all because of their loyalty to the home team. ’ .

l have'seen many senseless incidents occurring at Three Rivers 1

Stadium that are considerably worse. In 1974, when the Pirates

clinched the pennant against the Chicago Cubs, fans were throwing,

bottles at outﬁelder Jose Cardenal. I was sitting next to these “fans,”’
who were ,drunk and not overdoing their support of the Pirates.

Incidents in hockey are very minor compared to this. Not everything

about the sport is barbaric (did you ever notice the pretty girls at the " ’’

Civic Arena?). It just has to be taken for, what it is--a fast-moving.
hard-hitting, temper-ﬂaring game. i 4

7 Sure, there'll be the Wayne Makis and the Dave Forbes,’ but the
incidents involving them evolved from the rugged nature of the game.

As for drug users and gamblers, I’d rather think of hockey brawlers,
who are hurting the reputation of the game far less than the others.

COURT OK‘S DRUG ADS

WASHINGTON (AP)—Drug-
gists were freed to advertise their
presciption prices by a Supreme
Court ruling Monday that consum-
ers have a constitutional right to
receive such information.

The court’s 7-1 decision aban-
doned a rule, laid down by the
justices in 1942, that the First
Amendment guarantee of freedom
of the press does not apply to
purely commercial advertising.

It also established a new doctrine; I‘:

that those receiving information, as
well as those conveying it, have a
right to challenge infringements of '
free speech. '

NEIGHBORHOOD NOISE

WASHINGTON (AP)—Amer-
icans’ biggest complaint about
their neighborhoods is noise,
according to a Census Bureau
study released Monday.

Census said the 1974 version of
its annual housing survey showed
49.2 per cent of American

households ‘feel their neighbor?

hoods are too noisy. By contrast,
about a third as many—12.1 million
compared to 34.9 million—feel
crime in their neighborhoods is
high enough to be considered an
undesirable condition.
