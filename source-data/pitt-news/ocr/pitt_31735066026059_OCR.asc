A feeling of dread came over Kristy
Howells last year when she saw her housing
lottery number.

"It was 2,300 or something," the sopho-
more said. "All my friends‘ numbers were
very high, also."

Such high housing numbers made their
on—campus living prospects dim, especially
since they wanted to live in a suite in either
Bruce or Brackenridge Halls.

The girls split up and lived in doubles in
Holland Hall, instead of begging to live with
any loser with a low lottery number so they
could get their suite.

As of tomorrow, students who want on-
campus housing for next year have to start
the process or lose their chance for sure.

In rr1id—J anuary, all students living on
campus received a packet of information
describing the housing process, which can
be complicated and confusing for some.

In mid—Februa1y, students received their
housing number and instructions for choos-
ing a room or suite for the following year.

Students must retum housing contracts
and their $200 housing deposit by tomor-
row, Thursday, Manch 12, if they want on-
campus housing for next year. _

"The most important thing for students
to remember is March 12," said Diane
Casile-Gross, Housing's room assignment
manager. "Don't let that pass by because you
will lose your opportunity."

When a student fails to pay a housing
deposit but still wants a room, he essentially
has to move to the back of the line behind all

Damon Hudac talked with numer-
ous students in Schenley Cafe and on a
Sutherland shuttle last evening about
health services, food services, and other
student issues.

While doing so, the Student
Government Board member also publi-
cized today's 8 p.m. SGB Town Hall
Meeting, where representatives of
Student Health Services, Food Services
and the Department of Housing will
ﬁeld any question students throw at
them.

"It's cool," said freshman Jon
Stadlin about Hudac's brief question and

Boulevard bus stop. "It's good that he
sees what interests people."

Hudac left last night's board meeting
around 8:45 and walked down the seven
ﬂights of stairs from the SGB's sixth-
ﬂoor ofﬁce to the Schenley Cafe, both
located in the Wﬂliain Pitt Union.

There he approached a few groups
of students to ask for their opinions
about selling text books, getting intem-
ships, food services, health services and
ﬁnancial aid.

After answering some students‘
questions about these topics, Hudac
handed out red slips of paper which
armounced the Town Hall Meeting and
who will be there to talk with students.

across Bigelow Boulevard to the shuttle
stop near Fifth Avenue and discussed the
same topics with a half dozen students
waiting for the Sutherland shuttle. He
also explained to them how SGB can

‘address some of their concerns.

He then hopped on the 9:40 shuttle
and talked with additional students while
handing out more Town Hall reminders.

Why is Hudac so interested in meet-
ing ’ with students face-to-face to
armounce a meeting and hear opinions?

"I regret that I haven't done the same
things I was doing during the cam-
paign," said Hudac, referring to his and
running mate Joe Gie1ata's tactics of rid-

Black History Month celebration before everyone left for Spring Break.

Drums, art, eats

Food services celebrates Black Hist. Mo.

Christal Hall

Staff Writer

The beat of African djembe drums
echoed off the walls in the Towers
lobby as the alluring smell of chicken,
the smell of greens and macaroni &
cheese greeted students at the door of
the Towers Cafeteria. b

Over 200 voices talking, laughing
and singing ﬂoated up the stairway
leading down to the cafeteria. Photos
of different Africans and African
Americans peppered the corridor at
the bottom of the steps.

Among the pictures was a photo
of a slave who was beaten so horribly
that the lash marks from the whip
never healed properly. You could
count the number of times his back
had been torn open.

Karin Harris, a local vender,
greeted students at the end of the hall
as they entered the cafeteria, offering
to sell renderings of famous African
Americans etched in marble, granite,
tile and fabric.

Beyond was Pitt Food Service’s
and the Black Action Society’s 9th
annual black history month celebra-
tion. It also served as a culmination of
the month's events.

The day's festivities included a
performance from student rap group
Third World Theory and a step show
from Delta Sigma Theta and Alpha
Phi Alpha.

Audience members danced to the

enthusiastic polyrhythms of a Kenyan
music group, J abali Afrika.

Darick Thomas, a Sodexho
employee, said the event was to focus
on the unity of African Americans in
the community through a better
understanding of black history.

Abdou Cole, the coordinator and
founder of the event, said the celebra-
tion was to honor all of Pitt’s African
Americans, from janitors to profes-
sors.

“I wanted to put their name and
pictures up,” Cole said, “but for secu-
rity reasons I was not allowed to.”

Cole said the event was to height-
en cultural awareness. He reminisced
about a girl who came to last year’s
event, saying she was a high school
student in a youth group, Inner Circle.

He said that when the girl came to
the event she didn’t want to go to col-
lege, but after seeing this celebration
of diversity she went home to her
mother, raving about how much she
really wanted to attend college
because of everything she saw at the
presentation.

Elementary and high school stu-
dents danced and clapped along with
the Pitt students.

JaNay Queen brought a youth
group that she mentors, Vision
Incentives, to see the performers.

“I wanted the kids to see their
people doing some positive, instead
of standing on the street corners,”
Queen said.

THE PITT NEWS

IFC and Pcmhel host
anti-alcohol party

Jason Galllnger
Staff Wrlter

Shilo Raube said she doesn’t
think there is a problem with alco-
hol at Pitt. '

So why were she and other
members of Delta Delta Delta
sorority at a party promoting ways
of having fun without alcohol?

“It’s always a good idea to do
these things to prevent there from
ever being a problem,” she said.

That was the prevailing theme
of the AAA/Pitt Greeks Mix—off
yesterday evening. It was sponsored
by the American Automobile
Association of Western
Pennsylvania and West Virginia and
Pitt Greeks.

Sororities and fraternities set up
tables in the ballroom of the
William Pitt Union where they
served non—alcoholic “mocktails.”
The drinks were judged on their
originality and taste while the
tables were rated according to how
much enthusiasm went into their
decoration.

Chi Omega, Phi Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Alpha Mu share the tro-
phy for best taste. The most spirited
drink award went to Delta Delta
Delta and Theta Chi. Most original
drink honors went to Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. And the tables with the
best themes were those of Alpha
Epsilon Phi, Delta Phi and Triangle.

More than 100 people turned

out for the party, including Pitt‘

Police Chief Deborah Furka.

Larry Geubtner of AAA agreed
with Raube that alcohol is not a
major problem at Pitt. Alcohol-
related problems at other schools,
however, prompted AAA to bring
its message here.

While it might have made more
sense to have the party closer to the
weekend to show how serious the
participants really were, Geubtner
said Tuesday was the only day the
room was available.

Brian Rakowiecki and Jeff
Riegelnegg served a drink they
called Fire and Ice, made with
peach sherbet and ginger ale, from
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s table. They
both heartily agreed that the event
was a good idea.

“People think of frats and they
usually think of ‘Animal House,”’
Riegelnegg said. “This event helps
to dispel that negative image.”

“This is the perfect environment
to show people that they don’t need
alcohol to have a good time,”
Rakowiecki said.

“We want to send the message
that you don’t need to put alcohol
into a drink to make it taste good,”
Valerie Peterson of AAA said.

And the message seemed to be
getting across.

“This event is awesome,” Raube
said. “It’s a lot of fun.”

Suite Retention
Students who want to retain the suite
they now occupy must return a Suite
Retention Form (available at the Housing
oﬂice in Towers Lobby) to Housing by next
Thursday, March 19. Students must attach to
that copies of their housing contracts, which
verify that they paid deposits by March 12.

On the following Tuesday, March 24,
one representative from the suite must stop
by the Tower A conference room between 1
and 4 pm. to verify their suite assignment.

Students can only retain a suite if half of
the current residents
plan to stay in the
suite and if those resi-
dents have found peo»
ple to occupy the
spaces of anyone
leaving. Casile-Gross
said Housing carmot
bend that rule and any
group who tries to
retain a suite with
fewer than half of the
current ' occupants
staying will not get to
live there.

"It comes to the
point where there's
nothing but gray and
the sky is the limit,"
she said. "You have‘to

through their junior year, Casile-Gross could
not speculate on the range of numbers that
could win the lottery for suites. She said she
has no idea how many current sophomores
will choose to stay on campus.

In all, housing has 162 suites available
for retention and bidding. A group who
wants a suite just has to ﬁnd one person with
a low number to live with them. The gullible
rich kid can pay for the TV and VCR.

Housing requires that students have
enough people to ﬁll the desired suite, a suite
representative responsible for processing the
bid, and, of course, Validated housing con-
tracts.

Students must submit suite bids no later
than next Thursday,
March 19. On the
following Friday,
March 27, the repre-
sentative will select a
suite at an appointed
time between 10
am. and 5 p.m. in
the Tower A
Conference Room.

Suite Selection —— requires the least

Students with
valid housing num-
bers who want to live
in a suite the follow-
ing year need to pick
up suite selection
packets in the
Housing oﬂice.

'Ihat packet con-
tains a suite bid form
that uses a point sys-
tem to evaluate who
qualiﬁes for a suite, as
well as a list of bed
conﬁgurations avail-
able in the residence
halls with suites.

Howells and her friends ruled out the
possibility of a suite last year because their
lottery numbers ranged from 1,000 up to
2,500. Housing denied their bid because of
the high numbers, so the four friends opted
for two doubles in Holland Hall.

"Brackenridge was the nicest of what
we heard," said the communication and
political science major. "Since Brackenridge
was the number one choice, we thought we
had a better chance of getting into Bruce.
[But] we never would have had a chance, so
we went with our second choice," Howells
said

Because this year, for the ﬁrst time, Pitt
has guaranteed housing to current freshman

work and prepara-
tion. Students can
retain their ' room
Tuesday, March 24
from 10 to 4 p.n1. in
the Tower A confer-
ence room. Those
who want a new
room must return
their housing con-
tracts and deposits
by March 12 and
then select rooms in
the Wrlliarn Pitt
Union Ballroom on
designated dates.

For instance, current sophomores with
numbers one through 500 will choose ﬁrst
on Tlresday, March 31, from 2:30 to 4 p.m.
Current freshmen will choose Wednesday,
April 8. The housing packet lists a full sched-
ule of times.

Because of their high lottery numbers,
Howells and her friends settled for commu-
nal kitchens and bathrooms on every ﬂoor
and no living rooms in Holland Hall. The
four girls currently live across the hall from
one another in the all—female dorm.

"It was a disappointment, but you do
what you can," Howells said

productive than I at effectively rep—?i
resenting the interests of the ‘Law
School within the University."

He said he will remain at Pitt as
a professor for the time being but
said he wouldn't rule out other pos-
sibilities.

"If there is another school
whose needs match my abilities,
then I could imagine being a dean
elsewhere," he said.

But for now, he will make
teaching his main objective. As
dean, Shane had time to teach only
one class each year, so he organized
"muffin and juice" breakfasts to
hear students‘ concerns about the
Law School to get to know the stua
dents. ’ 

He said that when it first startedi
out he met with students on a week— I
1y basis, but has since cut it down
to once or twice a month because
attendance is dwindling.

Shane said he will try to find
new ways to address student con-
cerns as a professor.

In the past, he said, he constant-
ly rushed to meetings or alumni
engagements and couldn't give the 5
students the attention he thought
they deserved. 5

"I hope that as a teacher I'll‘;
have a much deeper sense of the
students‘ needs," he said. 

He said he believes this will;
happen because he will be in?
greater contact with students?’
through ‘teaching class every day. 1

Shane is the fourth high—rank»— .
ing Pitt administrator to resign this 
semester. Pitt spokesman Ken;
Service said there was no connec— %‘
tion between this and the mid—§
February resignation of Lewis
Popper, general legal council; Paul ‘
Stieman, CIS director and Johnf
DeVitto, associate vice chancellor;
for business. All four administra-
tors will officially resign during the‘
summer.

In his Yellow Sheet message,
Shane outlined some of the Law;
School's accomplishments he was .9
proud of during his tenure as dean.

He said he leaves the job satis— f
fied with the sense of energy and?
growth the Law School experienced“?
through its new faculty, services,;:
technology and greater outreach to
the community. ll.

‘'1 am eager to get back to writ- 4
ing and teaching but do want myg

.i

professional life to involve some 
degree of public service," he said. 

In the conclusion of the Yellow 
Sheet letter, Shane pledged to 
strive to the best of his ability to 
improve the programs available to 
students, to increase opportunities 
and nurture a spirit of inclusive- 
ness where excellence thrives. '

He said he wants to communicate to
students what the SGB does, because he
doesn't feel enough of them know how his
group can help them. Hudac added that
there's no better way to do so than to talk
with students personally.

Hudac said he hopes to continue
meeting students on shuttles in the future
and to get other board members to join
him.

  

Tell the powers that

Somehow, Student Government Board man-
aged to convince three bigwig administrators to
listen to student concerns. In fact, they’re the
three administrators whose departments have the
most direct inﬂuence on students’ lives.

The heads of Student Health Services, Food
Services and Housing will all be present at
SGB’s Town Hall Meeting tonight to ﬁeld ques-

- tions and listen to students’ concerns.

SGB ought to be applauded for this achieve-
ment, because convincing administrators and
business people to listen to the public is no easy
task. But the battle is still only half won.

Students’ concerns will only be addressed if
students show up to present them. ’

The meeting will begin at 8 p.m. tonight in
the William Pitt Union Ballroom. It may be stu-
dents’ only chance to make their voices heard
and to get answers to serious questions, such as:

- If enrollment increases again next semester,
will the Department of Housing start cutting
beds in half to make room? Is Housing prepared
to deal with the real possibility that enrollment
will continue to rise? Will it continue to guaran-
tee students three years of campus housing?

0 What would it take to have a cafeteria besides
Schenley Cafe open for some reasonable length
of time on the weekends? How about keeping
something open all night through the week, like
Eddies’ or the cafeteria below Towers, so hungry
students cramming through all-nighters won’t-
have to live off candy bars from the vending
machines?

0 Speaking of 24-hour availability, what would
it take to have Student Health Services remain
open all night, or at the very least, on the week-
ends? The whole point of paying a student health
fee every semester is so that students can get
medical assistance when they need it while
avoiding expensive hospital bills. But that won’t
work for someone who sprains his ankle at 9
p.m. and has to either hike up the hill to UPMC
or call for an expensive ambulance ride.

These are only a few of the problems that
need to be addressed. Surely everyone has a
peeve they feel the University could fix. But
nothing will change unless students make an
effort to talk to the people in charge.

Fall of U.S.S.R. didn't leave U.S. invincible

Paul Clark
Columnist

An unfortunate fallacy that per-
vades popular thought is that only
the former Soviet Union and the
United States possess nuclear
weapons. A cursory Who’s Who
among nuclear nations should sur-
prise and scare some of you:

According to the International
Institute for Strategic Studies,
France holds 449 active nuclear war-
heads while the United Kingdom
has 260. A defected high-ranking
nuclear technician, Mordechai
Vanunu, testiﬁed that Israel has
manufactured 300 atomic bombs
and has color photographs to prove
it. South Africa, who has not signed
the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty), as of 1988 controls 20
nuclear bombs. One may not feel
especially endangered by this since
the above nations have been por-
trayed in the media as “good”
nations (in relation with the United
States and other “good” nations).

But what about these guys?
India bears between 12 and 20
nuclear warheads, while their neigh-
bor, Pakistan, competes with four. A
war and nuclear holocaust between
these two unfriendly nations remains
a distinct possibility. Both have been
in a mini-race for a decade, and now
India has the Prithvi missile, which
is capable of carrying a nuclear war-
head deep into Pakistan. Casualties,
even with such a small number of
bombs, would be tremendous (due
to the high densities of people) and
eventual United Nations involve-
ment would probably be necessary.
UN involvement means U.S. sol-
diers. Clearly, nuclear arms build-up
by these nations does not bode well
for their citizens or ours.

Most frightening of all may be
the current nuclear situation in com-
munist North Korea. While reports
from defectors have estimated the
DPRK’s stockpile as high as 50, the
CLA conﬁrms their possession of at
least 10 fully—operational nuclear
warheads, as of 1995, and this num-
ber may be growing. Combined, the
DPRK’s nuclear reactors have the
capacity to produce 45 nuclear
bombs a year.

Further, fully—operational
nuclear warheads mean that they are
ready to be ﬁtted on to nuclear-carri-
able missiles. The DPRK boasts a
plentiful supply of over 300
NoDong-l’s and NoDong-2’s with
ranges of 1,300 km and 1,500 km,
respectively. This makes Japan very
nervous. In addition, the DPRK has
thousands of short range Scud-B/C
missiles. This makes South Korea
very nervous. The U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) veriﬁes
that the DPRK also boasts a small
number of Taepo-Dong-2 ICBMs
with a maximum range of 6,200
miles (with a small nuclear warhead
attached). The missile could easily
reach all major west coast cities,
including Los

in the United States nervous yet?

Especially worrisome is that the
DPRK’s dictator Kim Jong II has a
vendetta against South Korea and its
allies (namely the US) and just isn’t
known to be a stable person. He, like
his father, has not allowed the
United Nations’ IAEA inspectors to
any nuclear reactor sites or suspect-
ed bunkers. Little wonder that we
are preparing to strike Iraq (with no
such capabilities) instead of anger-
ing the DPRK who could wipe out
LA.

Another remaining factor in our

THE PITT NEWS

Angeles, San I
Francisco and San Diego. Is anyone .

decision not to anger North Korea is
its alliance with communist China.
China wields over 2,350 fully—oper-
ational nuclear warheads. China also
possesses ICBMs — the ss18-class
DF—5, which are modiﬁed rocket
boosters normally used to launch
Chinese satellites. These have a
range of over 8,000 miles while car-
rying up to a 10-megaton atomic
bomb. Scared yet?

A few ﬁnal facts: Despite
promising otherwise, Russia has
continued testing its nuclear
weapons. Late last year, a seismic
tremor was detected in Russia — a
clear indication of underground test-
ing. The denials came swiftly while
Russian ofﬁcials blamed a small
earthquake. This earthquake just
happened to take place nearby a for-
mer Soviet nuclear test site, coinci-
dentally. Hmmm.

Articles from Russia boast of
new technology that they developed
to produce “miniature neutron
bombs no bigger than a baseball.”
The current lack of security in
Russia and the vast terrorist market
for such an item (IRA, Iraq, Iran,
Palestine, Hamas, etc.) holds
unimaginable consequences.

Simply put, when considering
only the vast nuclear dangers facing
this nation, the wrong answer to mil-
itary questions could translate into
millions of casualties. The United
States must keep the pace with rapid
technological advances in nuclear
weaponry and the changing nuclear
capabilities of nations. Blindly advo-
cating freezes and reductions in mil-
itary spending clearly represents the
wrong direction for defending our-
selves.

Paul Clark wonders, “Why must I
chase the cat?”

PoINr /COUNTERPOINT

Gates, Microsoft are pure evil

Michael Berquist

columnist

Bill Gates. No other man has dom-
inated the 19905 more than he. The
brilliant nerd computer wiz who
achieved the American dream: riches
beyond imagination (a little over $41
billion at last count). Now the empire
he created, Microsoft, is under attack
by the Justice Department’s antimono-
ply division for violations of United
States antitrust laws.

To give you an idea of just how
deep Microsoft’s dominance has been
in the increasingly important comput-
ing industry, consider this: Microsoft’s
Windows and DOS systems account
for 89 percent of the operating systems
sold in 1997. In the last two years,
Microsoft has s 
browsers sold in .-
from zero to ;

Electric and C

The adag
that what was
was good fo
might be g 0 - - V
is good for America.

History has shown that companies
insulated from competition tend to
ignore their consumers and begin to
produce inferior products. Microsoft’s
dominance of the computer market has

  

complacent’
1960s and very nearly allowed foreign
competition to ruin the company.

One can see the same sort of
smugness and se1f—satisfaction in
Microsoft’s leadership today. Gates
himself speaks wistfully of the day
when everyone in the world will own a
computer that uses Microsoft software.
It is as if Microsoft’s leaders are telling '
their consumers: “We know what is
best for you. You will do what we say.”

Some of Microsoft’s defenders
have argued that it is wrong to fault a
company for simply being too success-
ful. After all, since Microsoft domi-
nates the market, that just means they
make a really great product, right? It’s
too bad that is a badly ﬂawed pre-
sumption.

The idea that Microsoft’s domi-
nance over the computer industry is
due to the superior craftsmanship of
the products Bill Gates puts out is

  
 

  
 
 

  

 

ridiculous. Most industry analysts
agree that Microsoft has consistently
churned out inferior product after infe-
rior product.

One irrforrnation—systerris manager
complained, “I hate Microsoft because
I am frequently put in a position of
solving problems that would not have
come up if my customer had bought
software from another vendor.” An
MIT researcher noted in an interview
that the secret of Microsoft’s success
has been the, fact that its software is
plagued by bugs and limitations, mak-
ing it impossible for rivalsto duplicate
and improve upon their software. If
Microsoft turned out a good product,

. the researcher noted, its competitors

would actually have a shot at defeating
Gates.

altogether, a move which likely would
have fatally crippled sales of the com-
puter. That isn’t offering consumers a

hoice at

opinion in its favor. Considering the
fact that Microsoft is worth nearly
$160 billion dollars, it seems the com-
pany will likely be able to stave off the
Justice Departrnent’s attacks.

That is a shame, because it seems
fairly clear that Microsoft’s dominance
of the computer industry is probably
hurting the American computer indus-
try. In the final analysis, it is clear that
Microsoft isn’t remaining on top
because of its superior product or its
wise business strategy. Microsoft is
dominating the computer industry
because of its ruthless business tactics
and because Bill Gates has a phalanx
of lawyers standing ready to ward off
legal challenges against his company.

The time has come to break up the
evil empire.

the burgeoning Internet — the information

     
 

Oplnlons Editor

I have a dream that, one day, all comput-
ers will be made equal.

Well, maybe not equal, but at least com-
patible. Microsoft will be the company to
make that possible, unless its rivals succeed
with their unfair political strategies to gain the
upper hand.

Let’s look at the arguments in the air now:
Microsoft sells the Windows operating system
which runs almost 90 percent of the world’s
desktop computers. Recently, Microsoft began
to integrate its Internet software into the
Windows operating system, giving out the
software for free with Windows.

. Now, rival Intemet—software makers like
Netscape have taken their cause to Washington
and are trying to persuade the gov

 
   

 
  
 
      
   
 
 
  
    
  
 
 
      
    
    

superhighway that will connect all computers
together and form one huge computing

resource for everybody.
Nobody will buy CD-ROM encyclopedia
updates each year when bigger and better ones
2;, availab ‘ ‘

Computers will be, essenti ,
terminals to an endless stream of free infomia-
tion. They will slowly replace cable television,
trips to the bank or supermarket, and long dis-
tance phone charges.

Microsoft wants its operating system to
evolve into that fusion of operating system and
web browser. If Microsoft doesn’t achieve
that, somebody else will.

Somebody like Netscape.

James Barksdale, Netscape’s CEO, has
also known for a long time that browsers and
operating systems will evolve together. In an
interview with Barksdale two years ago, lime
magazine mentioned that his company’s web
browser — which dominated the browser
marketthen and still does today———-could even-
tually take the place of an operating system
like Windows. -

But you didn’t see anybody slapping him
with charges of monopolizing the market.

And Scott McNealy, from Sun
Microsystems, also seems to be well aware of
the inevitable future of computers. His compa-

ny created Java, a computer language which 
allows programmers to build software applica— l
tions that run from within a web browser, mak— ‘=
ing it even easier for a browser like Netscape
to replace Windows. Java runs on any com-
puting platform; not limited to just IBM com-
patibles like Windows applications are, appli-
cations written for Java will work on
Macintoshes, UNIX workstations and IBM 1
compatibles alike. }
But nobody is accusing Sun
Microsysterns of trying to monopolize the
market. '1

That’s bwause McNealy and Barksdale I

got to the politicians ﬁrst (as well as the obvi-

who made it rich). In fact, Senator Orrin Hatch,
who chairs the Senate committee investigating
Microsoft, represents Utah — home of Sun ,

Dig into those pockets; it's iuncirising season!

It’s about this time every year that
America falls under siege by a rather
surgically effective and unsurpassable
force: the Girl Scouts of America annu-
al cookie drive.

There is really no way for the aver-
age Joe to avoid this army of midget
beret-sporting warriors who attack with
precision and the most psychologically
overwhelming tactic known to mankind:
cuteness. This year, I have already fallen
prey to one of their soft—spoken
demands of unconditional surrender: the
classic, “You mean you only want two
boxes of Chocolate Thin Mints?”

How could I possibly turn down a
group of sweet little Girl Scouts with a
wide-blinking-eyed-cuteness-factor a
thousand times greater than that of
Bambi and Thumper combined? By the
time these pygmy tacticians turned
around and skipped away with my next
paycheck and an order for two metric
tons of cookies, I realized that I too had
become their victim.

Yes, how the mighty have fallen for
a case of Do—Si-Dos. (Oh, you sweet lit-
tle oatmeal peanut butter cremes, natu-
rally good with no artiﬁcial ﬂavors and
no artiﬁcial colors.)

The bottom line is that these little
girls could be selling arsenic pills and
most people would still end up buying
several packs “just to have around the
house.” The Girl Scouts of America is
an organization with a cookie—selling
public relations machine so strong that
they have even named their junior mem-
bers “Brownies.” And Brownies are

organized in
“troops.” And you
still think I’m
wrong about this
whole militant
cookie-sales phi-
losophy, folks?

But I don’t
want to pick on
just the Girl Scouts because many peo-
ple view those who do this in the same
fashion they do as, say, individuals who
club baby dolphins for fun and sport.

No matter who you are, you either
have been or will one day ﬁnd yourself
in an organized group. Once in such an
organization, you quickly realize that in
order to do anything more than meet in
the hallway of a McDonald’s every
Tuesday night and watch industrial
strength cleanser congeal, you need
money. This having been said, in every
group there is one person who eventual-
ly raises his hand and offers a suggestion
to the effect of “Hey, let’s sell candy as
a fundraiser. It will be fun!”

About the time this person starts
changing this motto to “Ve haf Veys of
making you sell candy,” he is henceforth
known as your group’s fundraising nazi.

The fundraising nazi makes sure
you sell, under penalty of severe casti-
gation involving a case of Skittles, no
clothes and a tennis ball pitching
machine. He soon hands you a case of
candy that comes in one of two easy—to—
sell forms: 1) brand name candy, but
comparable in si_ze and weight to that of
a small piece of hockey equipment or 2)

A MARC
Nuzzo

 

a generic brand undis-
tinguishable‘ from
everyday bathroom
grout. Needless to
say, these will both
sell for anywhere
from $1 to $2 per
ounce.

So there you are, stuck holding the
box. One part of you always wants to
leave it on the small dolly you use to tote
it around. The other half of you knows
that if you do this the fundraiser nazi
will make you fork out $354.23 for your
$25 ticket to this year’s national conven-
tion. So rather than ﬂee the country or
do something really difﬁcult like quit
the Webster’s Dictionary Fan Club, you
lash out at the people closest to you in a
formal social setting: your co-workers.

There are several ways in which to
try and sell fundraising candy at work.
The first, and least aggressive, is the
“spring trap” method. Using this
method, you set the box out in the mid-
dle of a table near a very public place,
such as a coffee machine or water cool-
er. During breaks, unsuspecting cowork-
ers wander in, see the box, and open it.
It is at this point that the trap goes off
and the prey is caught.

The ‘seller —- casually" and conve-
niently hanging around the box -
quickly chirps out something like, “Oh,
those are $2.50 each. Thanks so much,
Jimmy will be able to get his transplant
now.” At this point, the victim must
either shell out the cash or allow himself
to be categorized in the same group as

COLUMNIST

people who make fun of Girl Scouts.

Boom. Sale.

ﬁe next method is to actively walk
around and sell the items. Normally, the
higher up you are on the corporate food
chain, the fewer cubicles you’ll have to
walk to before you are sold out.
Whereas a gofer may have to walk
around the entire ﬂoor of the ofﬁce, a
manager normally need not walk any
further than his poop—listed employee’s
cubicles.

Ca-ching.

The ﬁnal way is the most aggressive
and risky. It involves opening the box
and pitching the candy at people in the
ofﬁce at the same velocity as a surface
to air missle. When the pack tears open
after bashing into their skull or ricochet-
ing off their elbow, you simply run over
and stemly say “Hey, look. You just
opened that. I hope you are planning to
pay for it.”

No matter what method people
choose to sell their fundraising products,
the ultimate goal is to return all money
to the fundraising nazi. Do not pass go,
but collect $200 so you can buy your
ﬁrst-bom back from the fundraising
nazi. Most importantly, don’t ever forget
that you’re in this organization because
you voluntarily want to be there.

Be there, that is, until next spring or
the Girl Scouts come around again ——
whichever comes ﬁrst. '

Comic strip is
improper means
to criticize a class

The Pitt News’ decision to run
the Feb. 26 installment of “The
Frosh Pitt” by Spencer Hindman was
just as irresponsible as his decision
to create it. If Mr. Hindman has an
issue with the format of the ‘Art of
Japan class, his first step should
have been to discuss it with the pro-
fessor. Using his comic to trash a
professor and his class is nothing
less than immature. Using the
teacher evaluations as a tool for
revenge is equally childish.

Furthermore, Mr. Hindman,
through his comic character, seems
distressed that a class on the art of
Japan would feature so many artists
with Japanese names. I am left won-
dering what he was expecting when
he signed up for the class. I suppose
he is disappointed that his semester
is not filled with images of Sailor
Moon and Speed Racer.

Before Mr. Hindman encourages

  

W 5 E
others to

avoid a class because it is
too difficult for him, I hope he
would follow the mature way of han-
dling such an issue. If he cannot find
a resolution to his problems the cor-
rect way, he always has the option of
withdrawing from the class.

Carrie Hager’s Feb. 19 column,
“Inmate rights mock legal system,”
is completely based on a false
assumption: “The entire idea of
prison is punishment.”

LETTERS

 

   
     
  

T h at
statement sums up the gen-
eral public’s opinion in this country,
and public opinion is to-blame for
the failure of the legal system.

Since A the original thirteen
colonies, prison has been, in addi-
tion to punishment, a form of reha-
bilitation and deterrence. But let’s
keep going with this punishment
angle.

Suppose I am arrested tomorrow
and sent to the Carrie Hager Jail as
an ultimate form of punishment. I’m
deprived of cable television, weight
lifting, education, conjugal visits
and whatever else ﬂoats one’s boat.

After twenty years in this isola-
tion, can you honestly believe that
I’m prepared to re—enter a society in
which I was deviant in the first
place?

For example, can you actually
expect a criminal mind not to rape

said you are no longer allowed to

after being deprived of sex for twen-
ty years?
Ms. Hager, what if your editor

write for The Pitt News because of a
mistake you made. You are given a
semester to improve your journalism
skills. Do you think being deprived
of paper_ and pencils will help your
improvement?

A team from the University of Pittsburgh tied for first place in the third annual
Student Simulation Contest, held in Miami Beach, Florida. The project involved
creating a computer simulation model of a real system (a bank, hospital, or

NEW YORK — From the very
beginning, this season was a
learning experience for the Pitt
men’s basketball team.

Ralph Wil1ard’s squad was
lined with a freshmen and sopho-
more core. They battled, win or
lose, to gain valuable Big East
basketball experience.

They have learned to play
through fatigue, while overcom-
ing a myriad of injuries, one of
which claimed redshirt sopho-

son is the way the season ended,
losing on a last—second shot by
Vrllanova in the first round of the
Big East Tournament, 96-93.

It was a game that had many
heroes, a game that needed two
overtimes to decide the outcome.
A game that went down to the
very last shot.

Unfortunately for
Vrllanova took the last shot.

The score was tied at 93,

stepped up and knocked down an
NBA—length three pointer at the
buzzer that set off a Vrllanova
celebration.

“You saw the beauty of col-
lege basketball tonight,” Pitt
Head Coach Ralph \Vrllard said.
“It’s a shame that someone had to
lose that game. But I told the kids
they left their hearts on the ﬂoor.
It hurts, but they [Villanova]
made the last great play to win
the game.”

Willard’s counterpart had a
similar message.

“We just didn’t win the
game, we got a heck of a memo-
ry too,” Vrllanova Head Coach
Steve Lappas said. “Something

special happened out ther

tonight.” I

As usual, Cummings — the
hero of regulation — did every-
thing right for the Panthers. He
ﬁnished with a career-high 37
points, the third highest total in
Big East Tournament history.

Cummings carried the
Panthers the entire game. One of
his heroic efforts came with only
1.2 seconds remaining in regula-
tion with the Panthers trailing 80-
77.

Cummings dribbled to the
top of the arc and attempted a
three—pointer. His attempt was
foiled by Celestand. However,
Cummings got the ball back and
drained a three pointer that sent
the game into overtime.

On the other hand,
Vr]lanova’s shooting beyond the
are almost put the game out of
reach in the ﬁrst half. Like the
ﬁrst meeting between the two
squads on Feb. 10, which
Villanova won, the Wﬂdcats hit

the teamis last .
game oﬁihe year.

The Wﬂdcats pounded Pitt’s
2-3 zone with their outside shoot-
ing, converting eight of 17 three-
point tries. As a result, they held
a 48-36 lead at halftime.

But as the Panthers switched

to a man-to-man defense in the_

second half, ‘Nova began to lose
their 12-point lead.

Attila Cosby scored on a
layup, and Cummings scored
Pitt’s next seven points during a
13-5 Pitt run to open the second
half.

Ricardo Greer, who ﬁnished
the game with Pitt’s only triple-
double of the season, pumped in
23 points, grabbed 12 rebounds
and dished out 10 assists.

Greer, like Cummings,
scored on very impressive plays,
one of which came when he

despite being fouled. He convert-
ed the three-point play, cleaving
Pitt down only one point, 57-56.
Teammate Cummings would
provide the tying heroics shortly
thereafter.

In the ﬁrst overtime, Pitt
built a four—point lead, but
allowed both Brown and
Celestand to hit three-pointers in
the closing seconds. Pitt could
answer with only one bucket,
tying the score and sending the
game into the second overtime.

But as time wound down in
the second overtime, Brown
came to V1]lanova’s rescue, hit-
ting the biggest shot of his life.

“It felt good when I shot it,

Lady Panthers ousted early by Wildcats  

Kevin Lilley

Sports Edltor

Last week “in New York,
the Pitt Panther men’s basket-
ball team dropped a close con-
test to Villanova in the first
round of the Big East
Tournament.

Last week in New Jersey,
the Pitt women met a similar
fate. Though they played with-
out an ESPN audience and fin-
ished up two overtimes earlier
than their counterparts, the
Panthers dropped a 56-51 con-
test to the Wildcats and ended
their ‘season with a 6-21
record.

“They were both pretty
good games,” Lady Panther
Head Coach Kirk Bruce said.
“Very entertaining, I thought.”

Unlike the back—and-forth
battle at Madison Square
Garden, the Lady Panthers led
for much of their contest,

   
   

building a nine-point lead by
the half and keeping a basket
or two ahead of Villanova until
late in the second period. But,
with just under three minutes
left in the contest, the Panthers
fell victim to a Villanova scor-
ing run, spearheaded by
Wildcat Jenn Beisel — the
game’s leading scorer with 19.

Monique Toney paced the
Panthers with 17 points while
Kenosha Chastang poured in
11 off the bench, and con-
tributed four rebounds and a
blocked shot.

Both leaders are freshmen,

‘which may be good news for

the Lady Panthers next season.
The only senior on the Pitt
team — forward Farrah Woods
— scored eight points and
pulled down nine rebounds in
her farewell performance.

As a team, Pitt outrebound-
ed Villanova 40 to 20. But,
instead of taking advantage of

the lopsided performance
under the boards, the Panthers
gave it away, committing 23
turnovers. The starting guard
tandem of Toney and junior
Gina Montesano committed
eight miscues between them ——
just one less than the Wildcats
as a team. Pitt forward Alecia
Balich added five turnovers,
and Woods committed four.

On the other side of the stat
sheet, Villanova managed 14
steals. Jenn Sliwa led the
Wildcats with four thefts,
backed up by,Beisel, Shanette
Lee and Jenny Higgins, who
had three apiece. The Panthers,
as a team, equaled S1iwa’s per-
formance.

“They started to press us
[in the second half], and we
started coughing it up on occa-
sion,” Bruce said, blaming the
high Wildcat steal total on
“sloppy passes” from the

If these three players had stayed in

. Lockhart and eight freshmen.

Considering ﬁve of these new recruits
were rated among the top 150 high school
seniors, Pitt should still have won at least 50
percent of their games, most likely more.

What should have been.

Two of these top recruits, power for-
ward Chris Seabrooks and point guard
Rashon Bumo, didn’t make the grades to
play in college right away and are attending
prep school to improve their marks.

Shooting guard John Finneman, one of
the top ﬁve recruits out of Virginia, was lost
for the year due to knee surgery. Power for-

   

wards Kevin Leslie and Michael Shin bat-
tled calf and knee injuries all season and
appeared in 33 combined games for a lim-
ited amount of playing time.

\V1th healthy freshmen, Pitt should
have  you get the point

On top of the two academic casualties
and the oft—injured freshmen, sophomore
Taylor broke his foot in October and
appeared in only 10 contests. Last season,
Taylor started all but three games as a fresh-
man and led the nation ir1 steals. In addition,
he was the third—leading scorer for the
Panthers. He alone could have helped Pitt
pull out three or four more victories.

None of these things happened,
though, and Pitt’s season ended last week in
the ﬁnal second of a double-overtime loss
to Villanova in the ﬁrst round of the Big
East Tournament. With more than seven
healthy players in the game, Pitt should
have won.

Panther baseball returns from Fla. trip with a 3-6 record 2

Matt Mento

Staff Writer

While much of the college sports
world was_ focused on the NCAA bas-
ketball championship last week, col-
lege baseball teams were competing
down south to prepare for their regu-
lartseason. ‘ -

The Pittsburgh Panthers baseball
team visited Homestead, Fla., over

up__to their regular season. The team
went 3-6 with impressive victories

and Chicago State (14-7).

Head Coach Joe Jordano com-
mented, “We learned a lot about our
team. It gave us an opportunity to
identify our strengths and weakness-
es.”

The Panthers began their week
well with an 8-3 victory over
Northwood. Catcher David Hoopes
had three hits with one run scored.
Left fielder Chris Delsignore had two
hits, including a double, two runs and
one RBI. Right fielder Jason Oliver
had three RBIs with one hit and one
run scored.

blast that added to the offensive
onslaught.

Starting pitcher Chris Gallick
picked up the win. Gallick threw for
eight innings and gave up only three
runs on six hits with two strikeouts.

Eastern Michigan handed the
Panthers a doubleheader sweep the
next day by scores of 4-3 and 15-12.
For the Panthers, designated hitter
Bill Brown had four hits, four RBIs
and scored three runs. Bob Balazentis
pitched seven strong innings while
striking out seven in the first game.

“Even though we lost we kept

ond baseman Harry Ciavarella each
had a hit and an RBI. Eric Rosing

“Our top strength is pitching,”
said Jordano of his pitching staff.

Lobaugh knew that the week was
tough for the team, but he said “it’s
early yet. It’s a long season and we
are still trying to work some things
out.” 3

Jordano commented on the
expectations of the team going into
this weekend.

“We played very poor defensive-
ly, and that is something that we have
to work hard on all season long. We
have to concentrate on the little
things, and they are working hard to
get there.”

The Panthers travel to Ohio State
for a three-game series this weekend.

Toney’s six turnovers led the
team. Prior to the tournament, Bruce
expressed concern over the freshman
guard’s ability to lead the team in
tournament play, and was hopeful
that junior backup LaTonya Blanton
would recoverenough from her knee
injury to play significant minutes
and give Toney periodic rest.

Blanton played seven minutes,
registering no points, no assists, and
no rebounds. Toney played 36 min-
utes before fouling out late in the
contest, thanks to her team—leading
scoring performance

“There wasn’t a whole lot of

opportunity to keep LaTonya for a
long period of time,” Bruce said,
because “Monique was playing so
well.” -
‘The Wildcats were eliminated
from the tournament the next day,
dropping a 56-48 decision to Notre
Dame. The Irish then fell victim to
Connecticut in the semifinals, mark-
ing the 30th win of the season for the
Lady Huskies. UConn,would pick up
win number 31 in the tournament
final, downing Rutgers 67-58 despite
the home-court advantage of the
Scarlet Knights.

The Pitt men’s and women’s track
teams went to their respective regional
championship meets last weekend, and
each came home champions.

The women went to the ECAC
championships in Boston. The top per-
formances at the meet came in the 4x800
meter relay team and Trecia Smith in the
shot put. The relay team of Joetta Purter,
Chantee Earl, Shauna McFadzean and
Tamika Dorin won first place and set a
school record of 8:54.33.

. Head Coach Steve Lewis had partic-
ular praise for McFadzean’s perfor-
mance.

“[McFadzean] had a personal record
twice, in the trials and in the finals. She
did a fantastic job,” Lewis said.

Unfortunately for the Panthers, the
4x800 meter relay is not run at the
national championship meet. However,

A Earl has qualified on her own in the 800

meters and will make the trip to the
national meet in Indianapolis next week-
end.

The only Panther athlete accompa-
nying her will be Smith. Smith won the
shot put at the ECAC meet with a throw
of 48- 1/2, her best ever.

THE PITT NEWS

Earl, Smith qualify for track nationals

And it’s not even her best event. She
earned a trip to nationals with perfor-
mances in the long jump and triple jump
earlier in the season.

Other top performances for the
women included Anna Kohler’s 2:52.23
in the 1000 meters, placing her third in
the East.

Ayana Coleman, who won the pen-
tathlon at the Big East championships as
a freshman two weeks ago, came back
with another strong showing, coming in
fourth in the region with 3462 points.
Kianga Lee, who was second behind
Coleman in the conference, finished
eighth with 3168. Teammate Gina
Bundy was 10th with 2801.

The men’s team, competing in the
IC4A championship meet at Cornell, got
a measure of revenge for a subpar per-
formance at the Big East championships
two weeks before. Despite having few
standout individual performances, the
team finished 11th out of 72 teams at the
meet. The Panthers finished higher than
several teams that beat them at the Big
East meet, including West Virginia and
perennial powerhouse Villanova.

Pitt did that without their top indi-
vidual performer, .hurdler Aranthes
Lewin. Lewin stayed out of the meet due
to a hamstring injury.

The only individuals to finish in the
top eight (and thus score points for the
team) for Pitt were Sekou Dilday and
Carl Taylor. Dilday was third in the 400
meters with a time of 48.36 seconds.
Taylor finished sixth in the 500 meters
with 1:04.23.

Pitt’s Tim Tyre also qualified for the
finals of the 400 meters but finished just
out of a scoring position in 10th place.

“Tim ran well in the trials, not so
well in the finals. Then he came back
and ran very well in his relay,” said Pitt
Assistant Coach Dave Sobal.

The mile relay team provided the
rest of Pitt’s points. Dilday, Tyre and
Taylor ran the final three legs. In the trial
heats, Jeremy Ward led off, but he was
replaced in the finals by Greg Blake.

“All five of those guys deserve cred-
it,” Sobal said. “The trials were tough.
The times were really close in there.”

In a photo finish, Taylor put Pitt in
first place ahead of Connecticut by .33
seconds. Pitt’s winning time was a track
record 3:13.36.

The indoor season for the men is
now finished, as no men have qualified
for the national championship meet. The
first meet of Pitt’s outdoor season for
both men and women will be March 26-
29 at Alabama.

Phi Beta Kappa——the national liberal arts honorary society founded by Thomas Jefferson
and colleagues in the eighteenth century~—seeks nominees (including self nominees) for the
annual Junior Prize.

The Phi Beta Kappa Junior Prize is awarded to an academically outstanding undergraduate
student who will ( a) graduate next year (Academic Year 1998-99) and who will (b) fulfill
the demanding breadth requirements for Phi Beta Kappa membership by the time of
graduation. The Prize consists of a $400 cash award and an inscribed medal to be awarded
at the Phi Beta Kappa initiation ceremony on Sunday, April 5, 1998.

Criteria for the Phi Beta Kappa Junior Prize are purely academic as evidence by scope and
attainment in the undergraduate curriculum of Arts and Sciences.

Are you a student who combines high achievement with significant curricular breadth
including two years (or equivalent) of college level language study? Will you graduate in
Fall Term 1998 or Spring Term 1999? Will you fulfill the relatively demanding Phi Beta
Kappa distribution requirements in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities? If
so, you may be a candidate for the Junior Prize. Additional information on Phi Beta Kappa

requirements or the Prize may be obtained from the University Honors College, 3500
Cathedral of Learning.

Please send or deliver names of nominees
(including self nominations) to:

Phi Beta Kappa Junior Prize Committee
Oﬂice of the Dean
