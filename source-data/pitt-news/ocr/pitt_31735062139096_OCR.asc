The‘ member-s ' of .the,'Owl Board
are ‘to be congratulated on the work
that they have done during the past

three_weeks. ’ A short time ago it

lookedas if. there would be_iio Owl
this year, but now‘ it is certain that
Members
of the Board decided so_me time ago
that they wouldjnot put out an Owl.
unless they saw theireway clear to pay
for the publication. They determined
that they would rather have no Owl
at all than to have one and leave a
big deﬁcit to be made up. ‘
It was decided. that
couldhave $1,000 on hand 'by Febru-
ary 18, it would be wise to go on with
Owl.
Onceit was decided that that amount

had to 'be forthcoming on ‘a certain.

date, every man on the staﬁ, whether
he was-elected to a -position‘ on the
editorial end of the -publication or was
elected-a buisness manager, got down
to work and did all in his power to
have t'he money‘ on hand.at ‘the ap-
pointed time. At ﬁrst the work went
a li-ttle slow for many of_the mem-
bers of_the'student body did not re-
alize that there would "be no Owl if
the‘-money was not forthcoming. But
the members of the board were not
discouraged and kept working away.
And on the evening ’.of. February 18
of“ the ’Owl
not only able to say that the needed
sum wason hand, but there was also
a considerable amount over the speci-

fied sum in the treasury. A
. ‘This -is the kind of work that coun s;_

It shows that the members of the Owl
board havethe rightespirit, andif the
workiof the board i-n getting -the
money together is to be takenpas a
criterion of the work that will be done
on the editorial side of the.public'a-
tion, we may rest assured that the

31914 Owl will be one of the -best‘ in

the history of Pitt.

' ; « THE PITT WEEKLY congratu-

lates themembers of the Owlgboard

on the great work they have done so’

far this year and onthe initiative that
they have shown, and wishes themall
success in the publication of the Junior

‘FOOTBALL SCHEDULE '

The football schedule of the Uh}

versity of Pittsburgh for next season
appeared in the last issue of THE
PITT WEEKLY. It is by all odds
the best schedule that was ever 3.1-
ranged, for the Blue and Gold. It 111-
cludes’ all the best games from last
season and in addition there 'have

4 been placed on» the schedule some of

the largest institutions in the coun-
try. Graduate Manager Karl E. Davis

is to be congratulated in it having se-. ~

cured such a favorable list of games
for the season._ ‘

The game with Lafayette is one
that will be of particular interest to
the members of the student body. For
several’ years the management has
been trying to have this team on the
sc'hedule. but 'up_'u,ntil this year- it
seemed that arrangements cou1d_not
be made for the University hf Pitts-
burgh and Lafaﬁtte to meet on the
gr-id-iron. . . _ ‘ _

If the Pitt team next season is as
satisfactory as the schedule, it should
not lose a game, and there will not be
a score made against it. In his ﬁrst
year as Graduate Manager Mr. Davis
has or :1’starter ‘arranged the best
schedule in football tha,t'we.ever had.
We hope that the good work that he
has done so far may keep up and .that
he,will be successful in everything
that he undertakes in behalf of Uni-

'v,e~r'sity athletics.

Paper by- Doctor‘ Rosenbloom.

The February number of” the

contains a contribution by Doctor’
Rosenblooni, in charge of’ Biological

Not on the Ballot.

Some alumni may think it strange
that names of men’
them do not appear on the ballot. It
may be well to state some of the

conditions which govern the election

oft officers and members of the Conn:
ci . - T '

First, only twi-ce the number to be
elected may appear on the ballot.
This eliminates a considerable num-
ber of nominees.

Second, it is necessary to ‘have the
consent of every one whose name ap-
-pears on the ballot before he can be-
come a cand~idate for election. A
number of alumni who were nomin-
ated have notvpermitted their names

to -be placed on the ballot; this ac-‘

counts for their absence.‘ / ~
