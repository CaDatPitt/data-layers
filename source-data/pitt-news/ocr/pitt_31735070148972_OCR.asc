Students observe SLeap Day

_ In an impressive display of creative lethargy, a select group of pitt students chose Wednes-
day to skip classes, citing the days rarely-occurring holiday as reason to shirk scholarlie
responsibilities. As part of the festivities surrounding the recently entitled “SLeap Day,”

the undergraduates took advantage of a once~every—four-years opportunity to avoid work
8: instead hibernated straight through the often-nonexistent calandar date. ‘ ’ " I

' ‘‘SLeap -Day was the best thing to ever happen to me. I slept, poured over Facebook

pages, and ate a lot of ice cream, sophomore Victoria Smith said; “It was much better then
sitting through myclasses;‘ which I do everyday.” , I ~ Q S '

ti; get out ofbed at all. .

Bythe time Mar. 1 arrived, however, both students were back to their normal levels of
productivity. But, the return to hardwork didn’.t’come without some added effort. ,
; , “I needed 3 Red Bulls in succession-to. wake up for classes today,” Smith said, “My usual

cup of coffee just wouldn’t foot" the bill.f’

"Because of the ( ad§_ective- _ ) work done by

so many, the University of Pittsburgh is mov— a
ing through what should be another banner ( I
amount oftime ), building on its enviable re- I

cord of impact and accomplishment in( norm,
),( noun ) and ( noun ). Pitt also is moving
through a historically ( atiiec rive ) year, with
nextweek bringing the 225th anniversary of (

event ), as a log—cabin academy situated at ( —

place ). Unfortunately, what almost certainly
will prove to be most memorable about 2012 is
that an already (:nel.odra.inat%c aclfective) bud-
getzyear has been made far worse by another
proposal for deep and disproportionate cuts.
To put that proposal in perspective:

It would take our cumulative two—year
cuts in state support to well in excess of ($1.112:
of .i’1“l{31“i€}7). .

- ’ It would reduce our state support, inab-
solute dollars, to levels that we have not seen
since the mid-( era ), more than a( amouzzt:
oftinie ) ago and when the state’s own budget
was about one-third its current size.

It would reduce our state support, if ad-
justed for inﬂation, to the lowest level since
Pitt became a state-related university.

In terms of proportionality, perhaps noth-
ing is more telling than the proposed general
fund budget’s bottom (_ A thing ). Overall
state ﬁinding would be reduced by less than
one-tenth of 1 percent, or $22.456 million.

' The cuts proposed just for Pitt are more than

( multiple ) that amount. -

~ To be fair, the budget pressures faced by
state government are ( achective ). Dealing
with them canlinvolve ( ovezfwrougiit ad_§eci:ive

) funding decisions, with success depending -

upon a spirit of shared ( noun ). And to
be clear, Pitt never has resisted doing its (

MAD LIBS

’ thing ). What we must resist —— not only for

ourselves, but for the many who depend upon
us — are disproportionately deep cuts that
threaten Pitt’s ability to continue making (
adjective ) contributions, either to deserving
individuals or to a vibrant, more productive

I (' place ).

It might be said, in fact, that our basic ac-

.V tivity is the ( ‘ - potentiai basic activity ).
I Pitt does that through the ipowerliof higher

education as we help position ( mnnber )
of students, each and every ( time frame ),
to more effectively ( verb ) the ( nouns
) that theyhave for their own lives. And we
do it, often more dramatiéally, through our
programs of ( tifzings ). Sixty years ago, all
of the United States was desperately dream-

ing about a cure for ( disease ’ ), and that,

dream became a reality through work done at
the University of Pittsburgh. Thirty years ago,
both physicians and patients were dreaming
about a time when ( §1‘i€:‘.€liCal proceztlure ’ )
might become a widely available treatment
for a range‘ of deadly diseases. That dream,
too, became a reality through work done, to a
large extent, at Pitt. Today, when people think
of a world without( thing ) or ( :12; ng )
or( tizing" ) or (- {mag ) they often look
to the work of Pitt researchers. The same also
can be said about dreams of a world made
betterby more accessible and less expensive (
thing ) or by. the miracles of ( thing ) or
( thing ) computing or by any of a number
of other advances.

In a very real sense, the ( politician )
perfectly deﬁned our challenge ‘—— not to let

. the debts of today crowd out the dreams of (

tinie ). However, the deep and dispropor-
tionate cuts proposed will not let us travel
to where we hope to be. In the weeks ahead,
then, we hope to work. with members‘ of the
legislature, as well as with the administration, «

to ﬁnd better ways to continue building the '

foundation for a strong Pennsylvania, which
should be our shared goal. I

News Editor

During aninspection on Sept. 16,

2o11,‘the Allegheny County‘ Health-

Department found several roaches

. in Market‘Central. ~

Pitt insists it was not a big deal.
After the department’s third in-
spection one month later, it did

not ﬁnd any more evidence_ of

roaches. ‘

Guillermo Cole, public infor-
mation '0ﬂlCeI‘ for the Allegheny
County Health Department, said
the department received an anony-
mous complaint on Sept. 13, 2011,
alleging a roach infestation in Mar-
ket Central. ,

The department conducted‘an

inspection on Sept. 16 and found-
both live and dead roaches, Cole

said. None of the roaches were o’n
food surfaces.

The report states the depart- 1
ment found “several large roaches ’

in bakery area near gas line, be-
hind the large oven, in soda syrup
room near office, under fruit stor-
age shelf and -near dish room back

‘ entrance.”

. When the department returned
on Sept. 23 to conduct a second
inspection, it foi1‘n'd “two baby
cockroaches in cut room near sink

pot” and one along the wall, the

report said. .
Cole said the department found

“considerable improvement.” He ~
-..also said an exterminator was
present during the inspection who‘

would be (in the premises every day

until the problem was rectiﬁed.
When the department returned

for a third inspection, on Oct. 19,

“[Roaches]
are not that
uncommon,
and we did

  take immediate

‘ steps.”  

-John Fedele  

it marked pest control as “satis—
factory.” ‘r

“We found absolutely no evi-
dence of any [roach] activity,” Cole
said. ‘

Health inspection report finds cockroaches in Market Central

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said that roaches are.“something
that all food service providers are
constantly on alert for.” .

After the department found the
roaches, an exterminator came out
seven days a week for six weeks
until the roaches were gone, Fe-

-dele said.

“[Roaches] are not that uncom-
mon, and we did take immediate
steps,” he said, stressing that
roaches are found in many eater-
ies. ' . P P ‘

Cole said that while it isn’t un-
heard of to see roaches in some
food facilities, the problem needs
to immediately be addressed
whenever its found. A

“It can’t be accepted and tol-
erated on a continuing basis,” he
said. . "
When the department does ﬁnd

roaches, Cole said it cites the op"-
erator of the facility and tells them
to clean the facility and take the
necessary steps to eliminate the
problem. * -

» “It’s not something wewalk
away from,” he said, noting that
the department wants to prevent

contamination of food from roach— -

es, which_could lead to illness.
“Normally we don’t ﬁnd [roach-

es] ,” he said. “But it’s not unusual

for particular facilities» to have a

problem atone time in its his— P

tory.” 5 » _, -
Cole said for facilities like Mar-
ket Centra1- that» serve a large vol-
ume of people, the department usu-
ally conducts routine inspections
twice a year, roughly six months
apart. He did not know thedate

, of the next inspection but said it’s

probably “pretty close.” I

Pitt researchers develop anti -theft

. By Aaron Stier-Cohen
_ Stajf Writer A

A Pitt researcher l1as developed’

technology that would allow a

‘person_to switch their credit

card on and off like a light.
Pitt professor Marlin Mickle,
the executive director for the

RFID Center of Excellence, de-"

veloped technology that blocks
unwanted scanners from lifting

credit card information without‘

the owner’s knowledge, making
credit cards more secure. H ”
Mickle said the scanners that

thieves use, called interrogators, ‘
send out radio signals that can.

read information on the credit
card and bounce it back to the
scanner.fThese scanners are
widely used legally to read credit
cards and track products. They
are even used on Port Author-
ity .buses to, read Pitt IDs when
cardholders, tap their cards to
get on the bus.

L

“The interrogator can [read a '

card]' anywhere from six inches
to a couple feet away, depend-
ing on the card’s orientation,”
Mickle said.

Currently, credit cards are
always ready to receive and
respond to a signal, making it
possible for tech-savvy thieves
to steal credit card information

from up to two feet away without

the victim’s knowledge. ' .

“I don’t know exactly what ‘
' kind o.f information is stored on

the reader,” Mickle said. “That’s
going to vary from company to
company.” ‘ ' I
With this credit card informa-
tion,-Mickle said that the thief
can make a duplicate card" that
emits the same radio signal as
the original credit card. This
would allow the thief to access
the victim’s funds through tap-
and—pay kiosks — like those
found~in CVS, Rite Aid and a
number of other businesses -

that allow users to simply tap

their cardlunder a scanner.
Mickle said he started de-
veloping the technology after
he was approached by a credit

dents of a well—known credit card
company came to me about se-
curity,” hqsaid.

Mickle had a simple solution _

for them: an “on”“switch.
He designed and produced
several prototype" creditcards

_ with broken circuits that essen-

tially shut the credit card off.

That could easily be completed .

with the push of a button on the

card, small enough that it could’-

be hidden. under a company sym-
bol or school coat of arms.
Once pushed, the button com-
pletes the circuit, readying the
card to receive a signal from a
legitimate inte.rrogato’r. When
customers want to use their
credit card for a purchase, they
would turn the card on. When the
card~is off, scanners cannot get

 

any information from it, making

it impossible for thieves to read

the inactive c-ards. ,
“[The.vice presidents] were

amazed by the simplicity of it,”-

Mickle said.
Because the University has a

‘patent, Pitt stands to proﬁt from-
"any company that licenses the

technology. Mickle gets 30 per-
cent of Pitt’s proﬁts, but he said

the cost will depend on a con- A

tract made for a company that
wants to license it. He has not
received any offers yet. _
However, Mickle speculated
that the new technology is not
cost-effective. He said credit card
companies may ﬁnd it easier and
cheaper to just pay customers.

stolen, rather than ﬁxing all of

Joseph Gallo, director at
Weber Shandwick — the pub-

credit card technolo

pany’s position on a product likee
Mickle’s. A «

' The website states that people
are not able to steal credit card
information that easily.

“The MasterCard PayPass
protocol only transmits informa-

tion over very short distances,
less than four inches, so consum- '

ers have some basic protection

unless someone gets very close

Mickle replied in an email
that ll/IasterCard’s statement

_ only applies to laptop scanners

that are within FCC regulations,
and that there are many illegal
ampliﬁers that can be put into
smaller, handheld readers.

“The solution works if the
perpetrators follow the law, in
this case the FCC'regulations.
However, distance is a function
of transmitted power and there
are many ampliﬁers available.
The people trying to gather the
information use readers e— not

. V Kelan Lyons
Columnist

In case you haven’t heard, Pitt is

facing severe budget cuts  again. ‘

Yes, Gov. Tom Corbett is poised to
further reduce our funding, this
time from $136 million to $95.2
million. A
Understandably, a lot of stu-
dents are stressed out about fur-
ther tuition increases. But fear

. not -—- below is a list of suggested

budget cuts that will ensure stu-
dents don’t have to take out more
bank—breaking loans;

Cut Professors’ Salaries

Let’s just ensure that profes-
sors earn less money so students

don’t have to pay more. Ideally, A

this willforce some professors to
leave, thus saving Pitt even more

‘ money. In fact, we shouldjust ﬁre

all professors and offer only on-
line classes. We’d save thousands
of dollars if we no longer had to pay
those pesky lecturers to share their
experiences and research with stu-

dents. Plus, we would never have to

go to class again! Maybe Corbett is
looking out for us after all.

Abolish University Housing

Forget Bruce, Brackenridge,
Lothrop, Towers, Center Plaza,
Forbes—Craig, Ruskin, Bouquet
Gardens, Amos, Holland, Suther-
land, Forbes, McCormick, Penn-
sylvania and_Panther Halls! First,

knock them all down and ﬁre the ~

How to hndl

staff. Then, allow ‘all the illustri-
ous South Oaklandlandlords to
move in and turn the former resi-
dence halls into oif—campus hous-
ing. Think of all the money Pitt

.. could save by not having to pay

security guards and janitors! Not to
mention the money it’ll save from
no longer having to heat and air-
condition the rooms‘. Sure,‘ Pitt’s

dorms provide a great wayfor ap-

prehensive underclassmen to make

friends and live close to campus, .‘

but remember: Students are here
to learn, not live comfortably.

Bye Bye, Meal Plans

If we’re getting rid of Towers,"
H we might as well get rid of Market

Central. In fact, let’s just abolish
meal plans altogether. Eradicat-
ing Sodexo’s on—campus presence
would save Pitt a tonof money,
which would in turn stimulate local

restaurants. Students shouldn’t be '

eating anyway. If they’re hungry,
they should seek intellectual nour-
ishment. At least Pitt can_afford to
provide that  for now.-

Get Rid of Research

It’s no secret that Pitt is a

research school. In fact, our re-
search expenditures, according
to Chancellor_Mark Nordenberg,

support ‘roughly 28,000 people

in the surrounding region. Then
again, research is a pretty bor-
ing endeavor and doesn’t really
teach us anything, so we should
probably cut its funding. I mean,
cancer research isn’t really helping

e Corbett’s budget cuts

- addictions isn’t making arly_prog—

ress and the Polio vaccine would
have been discovered without state
funding, right? I’

Nix Student Organizations

Every year, student organiza-
tions from Pitt Club ‘Baseball to
the Men’s Glee Clubrequest fund-
ing from the Student Government
Board. I.think we should get rid
of these organizations altogether.

' Why give money to fraternities and’

sororities, whose philanthropy
raises money for cancer founda-
tions and people in need? Or multi-
cultural clubs that enable students
to develop more well-rounded,

‘ tolerant world views? Students
‘should just pick up a few more

classes if they ﬁnd themselves

with free time, instead of trying

to develop leadership skills outside
of the classroom or raising money
for the less fortunate. _

In all seriousness, it would

make no sense to cut the above ele-
ments, and it would-make evenless
sense to force Pitt to again spike its
tuition. Sadly,-it appears that Nor-
denberg was right when he said, “It
is not possible for any university
to sustain public university tuition
rates if it is not supported like a
publicuniversity.” When a large
portion of Pennsylvania’s educated
youth is leaving the state, ensur-

ing that less students can afford ‘

to attend college here seems like
an unreasonable solution. I

After a grueling three months of
regular season men’s basketball in
the Big East, all 16 of the confer-
ence’s_ teams will do battle in the
Big East‘Tournament_ at Madison

Square Garden in New York City 3

beginning on Tuesday. _
While some of the Big East’s

i better teams will use the compe-

tition to prepare for the NCAA.
Tournament, teams at the bottom
of the conference standings — like
Pitt —— know the Big East Tourna-

ment is their last chance to earn a I

bid into the Big Dance. All-confer-
ence tournament champions earn
an automatic berth inthe NCAA,
Tournament. _

~ So heading into the much-an-
ticipated 2012 version of the Big
East Tournament —— .the 30th an-
niversary for the event at Madison

Square Garden — here are my con- V

tenders, pretenders and sleepers
for the ﬁve—day showcase of Big
East basketball. ‘ . -
Contenders:
Syracuse — After locking up
the Big East regular season title,

the Orange will enter Madison

Square Garden as the hands— down
favorites to bring home the tourna-
ment championship trophy. Syra-
cuse might have the deepest and
most talented team in the Big East,
but history has shown that being
the No. 1 seed doesn’t always lead
to success in the conference tour-
nament. The top seed has come
away with the trophy just twice in
the past nine years.

_ - Georgetown — Considering

ﬁve of the Hoyas’ six losses this

season came on the road, it might 1

be surprising to some to see them
listed as contenders in a tourna-
ment played, away from home.
However, Georgetown tradition-
ally plays well in the Big East Tour-
nament and has earned a spot in
the tournament ﬁnal in three of the

' last ﬁve years. Overlook the Hoyas
. at your own risk.

  Ben Howland .

By RJ Sepich
Staff Writer ,

Two former Pitt men’s basketball

players disagreed with a Sports Il-

lustrated story released this week .

that described former Panther head
coach Ben Howland as a hands-off

coach who doesn’t punish players ‘

who break team rules like partying
on nights before games and inten-
tionally injuring other players dur-
ing practice. G

Howland, the coach credited
with returning the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball program to prominence,
has been ‘the l3ruins’.head coach
for nine years. He appeared at the
center of a story that suggested that
UCLA men’s basketball, one of the
game’s most prestigious programs,
was spiraling out of control.

However, some of Howland’s

former Pitt players said they don’t ’

believe that Sports Illustrated’s por-
trayal of their former head coach
was accurate. _ G . I ‘ J

“You just don’t know what to
believe,” former Pitt guard Jaroh
Brown said. “That wasn’t the Coach
Howland I knew.”

Brown played for the Panthers
from 1999 to "2004.

One of Browr_1_’s former team-
mates,Julius Page, a guard for the
Panthers from 2000 to 2004; said
that Howland positively inﬂuenced
both Page and his teammates.

“I feel like Coach "Howland did

‘ a great job at doing everything in .

his power to make sure we were
doing the right things,” Page said.
“ t the same time, there are only so
many hours in a day he can coach. If

their 2010 heroics when they. lifted
the Big ,East Tournament trophy.
West Virginia’s 3-7 record in its last
'10 games is worrying, but past Big
East Tournaments have shown that
anything can happen when a tal-
ented and experienced team gets

. hot at the Garden.

Connecticut — For similar rea-
sonslto West Virginia, UConn_ could
be a scary team to face next week.
As defending Big East Tournament
champions, the underachieving
Huskies likely will need to win

l I ﬁve games in ﬁve days like they

did last season in order to earn
a NCAA Tournament bid and de-
fend their National Championship.
Last year’s savior Kemba Walker

isn’t walking through the door, '
but UConn still has the talent to .

the players are going to go out and
party at 11 o’clock at night, there

. isn’t much he can do.” -

Brown agreed withhis old team-
mate. . G ,
,“Coach Howland believed that
we were mature enough to handle
our own personal business,” Brown

said, “But when we were together as ,
ateam, he did everything he could,

to_ make sure we were all on the
same page and had team unity.”
Howland coached the Panthers
from 1999 to 20.03 and after two
years of rebuilding, led Pitt to back-
to—back trips to the Sweet Sixteen

round of the NCAA Tournament in‘

2-002 and 2003. After taking the
Panthers to the Sweet Sixteen for
the ﬁrst time since 1974, he was
named National Coach of-the Year
in 2002 by ﬁve major media out-
lets.

' After moving to UCLA in 2003,
Howland led the Bruins to three
consecutive trips tb the Final Four.
But the early success has been fol-

, lowed by recent struggles and the
A Sports Illustrated storyhas put

more pressure on Howland-

Page said that Pitt’s current head
coach Jamie Dixon, who came to
Pittsburgh as an assistant coach un-

,' der Howland, has a similar coach-

ing style to his predecessor.
“Coach Howland and Jamie

‘Dixon are. both what I would call
players’ coaches,” Page said. “They _

relate to their players, expect them
to be mature and allow them to po-
lice themselves, but that doesn’t

, mean I wouldn’t call them hands-

off coaches.
‘ “Both coaches really care about
their players.” I ‘

make some noise.

Pittsburgh — Wednesday
night’s victory over V St. John’s
showed that the Panthers still have.
the capability to ﬁnish this disap-

' pointing season on a high note. Pitt

has struggled_this season on both
sides of the ball,‘but the Panthers
have done welldufing the rare

~ occasions when the ‘entire team

is on the same page. If Pitt’s stars

.- all show up in New York City and
the Panthers get some favorable

match—ups, then a run to the semi-

ﬁnals isn’t too far-fetched. _ I

Students observe SLeap Day

In an impressive display of creative lethargy, a select group of Pitt students chose
Wednesday to skip classes, citing the day’s rarely occurring holiday as reason to shirk
scholarly responsibilities. As part of the festivities surrounding the recently titled “SLeap
Day,” the undergraduates took advantage of a once-every-four-years opportunity to avoid
work and instead hibernate straight through the often-nonexistent calendar. date.

“SLeap Day was the best thingto ever happen to me. I slept; pored ov_er Facebook pages
and ate a lot of ice cream,” sophomore Victoria Smith said. “It was much better thansitting
through my classes, which I do every day.” b ' '

Fellow sophomore Patrick Mallee was unavailable for comment that day, as he failed
to get out of bed at all. '

‘ By the time March 1 arrived, however, both students were back to their normal levels of
productivity. But the return to hard work'didn’t come without some added effort.

“I needed three Red Bulls‘ in succession to wake up for classes today,” Smith said. “My
usual cup of coffee just wouldn’t«work.” ' A
