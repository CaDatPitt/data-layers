nglish Dept. Chairman

Takes Position As Acting Head;
Former Head Dr. George Crouch
Accepts University Secretary Job

By NANCY FUCHS

Frederick P. Mayer, professor
of English, has been named act-
ing chairman of the English De-
partment. He will replace Dr. W.
George Crouch who resigned his
position as chairman to become
secretary of the University and
secretary of the Board of Trus-
tees.

Professor Mayer will assume
the duties of department chair-
man until a search committee of
English department members
ﬁnds a permanent replacement.
The department should have a
new head by next fall, accord-
ing to Dr. Crouch.

Dr. Charles Crow, professor of
English, is chairman of the search
committee. Other committee mem-

bers are: Associate Professors Dr.
Al.an Markman, Dr. Thomas Phil-
brick and Dr. Robert Whitman,
and Assistant Professor Dr. James
Simmonds. '

They will consult with the
other members of the English de-
partment and explore all possi-
bilities inside -and outside the
University. The committee will
work closely with Dr. Frank
Wadsworth, dean of the Division
of Humanities.

Dr. Crouch described Professor
Mayer as “largely a faculty
choice” for ‘the post of acting
chairman. “All the senior mem-
bers of the department were con-
sulted and agreed on him. He has
previously served as chairman
(1941-48) and knows the admin-

istrative aspects of the job. He is
an excellent teacher who has the
respect of everyone in the de-
partment.” '
Professor Mayer has been with
the English department for over
40 years. He received his bache-
lors and masters degrees‘ from
the University and since 1922
has served as student assistant,
graduate assistant,

sociate professor, and professor.

His major ﬁelds of interest
are the 18th century, literature
of the Bible, and the modern Brit-
ish novel. ‘

Dr. Crouch, who has served
ten years as chairman, will re-
tain his professorship in the Eng-
lish department.

Scalpers’ Prices

Cokes Cost ‘SO Cents
 At Pitt-Oregon Game

By HOBIE HARRIS
Cokes went for scalpers’
prices of 50 cents each on
the University side of the

Stadium at last Saturday’s
Pittsburgh —— Oregon game.

A-\<game. They usually sell for

"’ 2.5 cents.

The situation was the result of
90 degree temperatures during
the game which forced the fans
to buy Cokes at an unprecedent-
ed rate. By the end of the ﬁrst
quarter, many fans found it im-
possible to ﬁnd a vendor with
Cokes below the first few rows
of seats near the concessions
stands. Fans wanting Cokes had

‘{h‘\to leave their seats and walk to

the concession stands near the
exits. I

The stands became crowded be-
yond capacity, and vendors emerg-
ing from the commissary with
full trays of Cokes often found
themselves selling Cokes in the
rear areas because of the number
of peoplewho had come back in
search of relief.

The fans, in their eagerness to

get the Cokes, were in such com-
petition, that they began to bid
for Cokes and vendors were able

V to get almost any price they

wanted. This practice spread to
some of the vendors who were
able to get to the fans still in
their seats.

Myron O’Briskey, general man-
ager of Sports Service, said that
he was.“deep1y sorry” over" the
scalping, and promised to fire

.any vendors whom he could
prove were overcharging. As of 5

p.m. Wednesday, one man had»

 been fired, andthe other 12 work-

   

ing in his section were being in-
vestigated.

O’Briskey pointed out that it was

COKE CUP
Sutur(Iay’s Saga

hard to ﬁre men without deﬁnite
proof and that none of the many
complaints he received included
thevvendor’s badge numbers since
most of the scalpers took their
badges off. Sports Service keeps
12 to 15 men in the stands as
spotters, but none of them caught
any of the vendors scalping.

Several days before a game,
0’Br'.iskey gets a weather report
from the Weather Bureau and
an estimate of the crowd from
the Director of Athletics. From
this information, he estimates
how much Coke" he can expect
to sell, and orders that amount.

The estimate for Saturday’s
game was low. Sports Service
actually ran out of Cokes in sev-
eral areas, leaving the fans at
the mercy of the heat.

“We over-ordered, ‘we thought,"
Q’Bris_key said. “We hadpmore ice
than at any othergame.”

0’Briskey stated that he could

502 at Smoker Represent -   .
Large lncea in Fall Rush  

By FRED N. FRANK

The Greek system at the Uni-
versity looked strong Wednesday
night at the Interfraternity Coun-
cil (IFC) Smoker. Five hundred‘
and two men, mostly freshmen,
who signed ‘up for fraternity
rush packed the Student Union
ballroom.

With an increase of nearly 125
men over last year’s smoker, As-
sociate Dean of Men Parker F.
Enwright described this “as one
of the largest smokers since the
early ﬁfties.”

The number of men who sign-
ed up for rush at the smoker
was more than all of those who
signed up during last year’s' fall
rush. The increase in number at
the ‘smoker was more than pro-
portional to the increase in gross
enrollment from last -year, ac-
cording to Dean Enwright.

After the speeches in the Sup-
per Room, the rushees ﬁlled out
information cards and registered
with the central rush commit-
tee. .All men who want to parti-
cipate in rush and eventually ac-
cent a bid from a fraternity this
term must register at some point
with the Dean of Men's office, if
they didn’t do so at the smoker.

Once registered, the rushees

were free to travel from table to '

table in the Ballroom. The fra-
ternities set up a table where

their trophies, public.ations and
composite pictures were display-
ed. Five men from each of the
houses stood near their table to
meet the rushees. Rushees had
to take around a card to be signed
by representatives of four frater-
nities, to show they had talked to
men in more than one house.
Usually the fraternity repre-
sentatives have time to talk with
the potential members about the
rush affairs and answer any of

the rushees’ questions. Because

of the lack of Room, as men hud-.
— dled around the tables Wednes-

day, fraternity men were forced
to cut conversation to a minimum.
The rushees signed up for affairs-
and then went on to other tables.

Formal rush will extend until
Oct. 4 .and will be followed by a_
week of informal rush, where a
fraternity can bid a man at any
time. Any man who did not reg-

‘ister at the smoker can register

up until 5 p.m. next Thursday,

in the Office of the Dean of Men, .A

 S Coke Scalping
T71 Raises Protests

Editor, The Pitt News:
I [During the half-time perform-
:ance at the Pitt-Oregon game Sat-
-urday, several of my friends
braved the crowd and intense
‘heat to obtain Cokes directly be-
,‘ hind the student section. Much to
]their surprise, they found the 90
degree heat had placed an 'un-
usual demand for Coke, resulting
in sales of full carriers holding
:20-25 paper containers for $5-$6
{(25 cents each).
' I . In order to purchase two Cokes‘
.- from the full carriers, my friends
.were forced to pay a scalpers’
.'‘price or $1. '

Editor, The Pitt News:

I wish to refer to Dr. Berke-

usage of the Fine Arts Building
still owned by Miss Frick.

The whole affair is ridiculous.
If the University has no power

Last Saturday’s Coke crisis at the Stadium provides some interesting
‘insights on collegiate conduct and management of the Stadium.

,, Students acted like a crowd of wild Cannibals deprived of their daily
morsel of meat. They ‘crowded aisles, harrassed clerks, and blocked the
entrances to commissary stations.
A Not only were they creating-a ﬁre hazard, but they were preventing
.-theiilvendors access to their loading stations. Even if any extra amount of
Coke had arrived, the distribution would have been hampered by the Coke-

Of course, the Sports Service’s meager corp of vendors also hampered
-adequate service. Withthe Pittsburgh Pirates in fifth place, surely Mr.
3-O’Briskey could have shifted more men to the Stadium for opening day.

New Left Protest

Editor, The Pitt News?

Two comments occur to me as
_a result of the article on the first
meeting of the New Student Left.

It is disheartening to read that
one of our most recent graduates
would lead a’ picket against a

movie theater because of its price"

policy and its hiring practices.
On the issue itself, I think a
privately owned theater should
be allowed to set whatever prices
it feels are appropriate. I would
also oppose the forced use of only
union 1abor."What bothers me
most about Mr. Garﬁnkle’s pro-
posal does not involve the issue
itself, however. I have always
considered picketing and other
similar forms of social protest .as
a means of awakening the pub.

lie to the nature of,a great social

injustice andvasking the public’s

’ support in ﬁghting this injustice.

I question whether the average
Pittsburgher is vitally concerned
with this so-called problem. This
leads me to question Mr. Garﬁn-
kle’s real purpose in picketing

‘the King's Court. If overt pro-

............ s.....e...... e. 

Perhaps Mr. O’Briskey has a different view of the profit motive.
Perhaps customer satisfaction is secondary to profit. After all, ice is
cheaper than syrup. ’

 

His promises of ﬁring the irresponsible vendors are commendable.

But better service might be more appreciated. ~

issues and will become simply
an object for ridicule.

From time to time people have
questioned the motivation and
dedication of students who in-
volve themselves in protest ac-
tions. While willing to give any-
one the beneﬁt of the doubt, I
must question the dedication of
those who would join a “Perma-
nent Picketing Committee wheth-
er for the theater or Vietnam.”

These students will not think
through the rationale for each of
their protests but will picket
merely because someone says
that a condition exists which
should be picketed. This is pro-
testing for its own sake and not
something which. has received
consideration. ’ This
type of blind obedience can easi-

_ly. be diverted into something

which many of the students

sidered it more thoroughly.

It is one of the conditions of
being a student at a great Uni-
V€‘1‘SitY that the person be ex-
posed to new ideas which will
change his ways of thinking and
living. This‘ must be tempered
with responsibility, however. The
student must always think
through for himself the nature
and consequences of whatever he
is doing. Blind protest, without
thought and commitment, would
be worse, I believe, than no pro-
test at all.

Attendence at ‘SG
Meetings -Asked

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is time for the students on

unequivocally show the SG what
the student actually is on major

enough of inspired political chi-
canery that goes on each Thurs-
day night. We want an SG that

No longer can the students

News Coverage
Criticized

: Editor, The Pitt News:

The Monday edition of The
Pitt News is a typical‘ example

of “one of America’s Great Stu-x

dent Newspapers” losing contact
-with the student body, and there-
by failing to accurately record
the basic flow of student activ-
ity. »

Firstly, . the front page lead ~
article opened, “Student Gov,ern- .

ment 1 passed a bill creating a
Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee to allocate activities fee funds
. . .” This is not only totally false,
revealing .a lack of i1nderstand-
ing of Student Government pro-
ceedings, but also calls into ques-
tion “our” newspaper’s degree of
political sophistication. As a

Student Government Senator, I

would like to take this opportun-
ity to inform The Pitt News that

priations Committee to allocate

Secondly, in an article entitled
“Liberals Form New Organiza-

as advocating “A Permanent
Picketing Committee, whether ‘it
be the theatre or Vietnam.” What
I did call for was a “Permanent
Co-ordinating Committee" to

J deal with many of the vital is-

sues presented at that meeting.

Although a correction from The ‘‘

Pitt News appears in this edition
of the paper, -the inability to dis-
tinguish a fundamentals and re-
cord fact in the news colunms
is totally irresponsible.

This inability to record abso-
lute fact in the news columns is
appalling, especially at Pitt where
the student body must place
faith in The Pitt News as their
major source of information. The
Pitt News has constantly urged
for “responsible” action by stu-

dent organizations. The student

body is now asking The Pitt News

CORRECTION

The suggestion by John Rus-
kay, liberal’ arts sophomore,
that the New Student Left form
a “Permanent Co-Ordinating
Committee” was erroneously
reported in Monday"s Pitt News
as “Permanennt Picketing Com-
mittee.” A

“The impression‘ created by
the article," said Ruskay “was
that the sole function of the

committee would be picketing.‘

Educational and socially orient-
ed programs would be the
prime function of such a com-
mittee.”

Goon THINGS IN SMALL PACKAGES

Again’ Coach Michelosen wastold at the Weekly Foot-
6 ball Luncheon held for the beneﬁt of press and radio at Gus-

tines Tuesday, that his team was -favorite by one point.
Again he frowned, Michelosen hates to be favored.

The oddsmakers must have talked with Harold Keith,

Oklahoma Publicity director. His report at the luncheon

was the exact opposite of what Hal Childs said about O.e-
gon. Keith talked of the many sophomores that the Sooners
are going with this year.

One has to be dubious when he hears a report like this

if from Oklahoma because many of their sophomores are prep 0

school boys and_ red shirts. 'Red shirts‘ like Tom ,Tra.vato

ywere also present in the Oregon line-up, last Saturday. The

gridders discontinued this practice (of holding men for one
year so they can mature)’, as did the rest of the big inde-
pendent schools in the East. 0

The Sooners have a seventy man squad, and their is
safety in numbers. Although there are only 44 men travel-
ing the Sooners have twenty more men to chose from than

_ the Panthers whose entire squad is less than 50.

Among those making the trip, it is a safe ‘guess that ,
there will be some fast and good-blocking linemen. Head

Coach Gomer Jones was line coach for Bud Wilkinson and
a trademark for these “golden days” of Oklahoma football
was a small, quick line. '

This year is no exception. The Sooner line averages
around 210 pounds including a 190 pound guard. Michelosen
knows what is in store for his team. “We don't know too
much about Oklahoma this year, just that they have a lot
of line-up changes. Without. scouting. them we also know

-that their line will be small, but fast and hard hitting.”

0 The Oklahoma\ hard hitting line will have to contend
with the defensive stalwarts Jim Flanigan, Josh N ovogratz,
Bob Guzinsky, and Joe Pohl.~ All were cited by Michelosen
for their good performances in the Oregon game. Eric Crab-
tree was also mentioned for his offensive show. The coaches

are quite certain Ok1ahoma’s kick-off man would keep‘ the 0
i ball away from Crabtree. “ « ‘

West Chester

ny“GEoB.Gi-2 M. LIES
The soccer team meets West
Chester State tomorrow. West

Chester is a pressuring type of

team which makes their oppon-
ent play into their hands.

At 9:00 this morning, the boot-
ers___departed on their trans-Penn-
sylvania jaunt, arriving on the
Westchester campus, near Phil-
adelphia, just in time ‘for a late
afternoon workout. Coach Leo
Bemis wanted the boys to be
loose for the Saturday afternoon
battle, and so he planned to al-
low the players some free time
in town after supper. 0

West Chester in ﬁve meetings
with the soccermen have never
lost, but has been twice tied.
Last year, the Rams had one of
their poorer records, seven wins,
four losses, and two ties. They

edged the soccer team, 3-2.

“West Chester always plays
the toughest schedule in the na-
tion and they have a good, tough
ball club every year,” said Be-
mis. “Their players are in the
best condition; they do a lot of
running.”

This, the second game of the
year, is a big one for the booters.

First of all, Bemis can get a
better picture of goalie Ed Zel-
nick. “Besides formal and intra-
squad scrimmages, we -haven’t
seen enough of Zelnick to make
a judgement. In the Frostburg

, game, he had to stop only one

hard shot because our defense
protected him,” said Bemis.
Against the Rams, Zelnick may
make more than one save.
Secondly, West Chester should
give Bemis’ new defense a real
