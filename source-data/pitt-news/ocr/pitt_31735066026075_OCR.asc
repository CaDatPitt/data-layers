T a/ee caution when making spring break reservations

By Donna Pesansky
Staff Writer

For the pastltwo weeks the temperature has not
reached 40 degrees, you have 10 chapters of a book to
read that you have not picked up all semester, and the
paper you spent all night typing in the computer lab is
lost forever. —

Now stop, take a deep breath and kick back for a
moment and think about trading those pens and books
for suntan lotion and a bathing suit.

Spring Break 1993 is just around the comer, and if you
are thinking about heading to Florida, Cancun, Jamaica
or any other hot spot you better start planning now, said

Joanne Cosentino, a travel consultant with University
Travel Services.

“It’s important to book way in advance. After January,
air fare will start going up, and it gets harder to "get the
hotel and package you want,” Cosentino said.

No matter what travel service you choose you should
conﬁnn at which hotel you are staying and look for hid-
den costs. “When you’re in the Bahamas or Jamaica, the
hotels automatically include a 15 percent gratuity fee on
top of all prices that you thought were prepaid. All rep-
utable services will either include these fees in the price
or specifically warn you about them,” Cosentino said.

“Be careful of sleazy Spring Break companies; call the
‘company to make sure they are running the program,”

said Patrick Kandianis, director of regional sales for
Student Travel Services, a New York based travel whole-
saler. “Because if they work through a wholesaler, then a
company like STS will get the names of their customers
in February and we put them wherever there is room.”

“We charter our own planes and block the hotel
rooms ourselves. The exception is in Cancun where we
work with a land operator,” Kandianis said.

It is riskier to vacation in Mexico. Oftentimes contracts
are not honored so the land operators deal directly with
people right there in Mexico to make sure things run
smoothly,” Kandianis said.

“It is important to stay close to home and deal with

A man posing ‘as a ticket scalper threat-
ened to shoot and subsequently robbed a
basketball fan before last Saturday night’s
game, according to campus police.

The victim, who is unaffiliated with the
university, was parking his car on
Allequippa Street at 7:55 p.m. to go to the
Panthers’ basketball game when the suspect
approached him and asked if he wanted to
buy a ticket to the game. .

"The victim declined, and the" sus-
pect, whose hand was underneath his coat,
said, “Give me your money or I’ll shoot
you.” ' ‘

The suspect, who is described as a black
male, 6 feet, 2‘inches tall and 215 pounds,
did not show a weapon, but the victim
gave him $21.

This was the second gun—related. incident
on the upper campus this semester. On
Monday, Nov. 30, a 17-year-old male
allegedly beat a male student on the head
with a long-barrelled BB handgun near Pitt
stadium.

The suspect in Monday’s case offered to
sell the student some “stuff” and then
pulled out,the gun when the student
declined. Police arrested the suspect soon
afterward.

At 10:30 on the same night of the ticket-
scalper incident, an unidentified person
shot out the window of a female Lothrop
Hall resident with a pellet gun. The resi-
dent said that she was in the room at the
time.

Gene therapy
may help cure
Gaucher disease

By "Sandra M. O"I‘oole
For The Pitt News

The nearly 20,000 Americans affected by
Gauchendisease may be one step closer to
more effective therapy, as University of
Pittsburgh researchers have successfully trans-
ferred the gene needed to cure the disease in
laboratory animals.

“The results of this study strengthen the
rationale for gene therapy as a treatment for
Gaucher disease,” said John Barranger, M.D.,
Ph.D., professor in the Pitt departments of
Human Genetics and Molecular Genetics &
Biochemistry and leader of the research team.

Gaucher disease is a result of deficient

(GC). GC breaks down a fatty substance
which is produced when old blood cells disin-
tegrate. When it is not broken down, the fatty
substance accumulates in the spleen, liver and
bone marrow, causing‘ organs to malfunction.
“You can think of GC as the garbagemen of
the body. They see dead‘ red blood cells,
process them and get rid of them. When GC
is not functioning properly, these dead blood

havoc,” said Susie Hunt, University of
Pittsburgh Health Sciences News Bureau assis-
tant director.

If patients do not receive proper treatment
“the organs can’t function and become full of
this ‘trash,’ and people afﬂicted with Gaucher
may eventually die from liver malfunctions or
. related conditions,” Hunt said.

You may be getting a break at
the book store if a proposal which
will sponsor scholarships for Pitt
students goes through.

The money for these proposed
scholarships will come from
the University of Pittsburgh
Book Center. According to the
“Book Center Statement of
Operations Fiscal Year 1991,” it
listed a $527,000 net profit for that
year. _

The Graduate and Professional
Student Association has submitted
a plan that calls for 14 scholar-

between the Student Government
Board, the College of General
Studies and the Graduate and
Professional Student Association.
Each scholarship is worth $200
dollars of credit at the Book
Center for books.

“If a bookstore is going to make
over half a million dollars in profit
from students, then some of those
profits should go back to the stu-
dents,”. GPSA President Steve Parks
said.

Ross Pasquale, SGB member, has
been an enthusiastic supporter of
this plan and any plan that would
make more scholarships available.

glad that it’s come this far. I’ve
been working on [getting this
done] since March.”

Right now it has yet to be deter-
mined who will be in charge of
deciding which students get the
scholarships.

More than likely, Pasquale said,
it will be the Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid, since it is in the
best position to determine which
students need the money.

CGS has unanimously endorsed
GPSA’s plan. Marcie Roberts, pres-
ident of CGS Student Government,

transplantation, the enzyme was present in
the blood supply of the mice. In_essence, the
mice produced the human enzyme.

“The results provided by this study demon-
strate that macrophages, the cells produced by
the bone marrow, in the transplanted animals
repopulate the bone marrow, liver, spleen

and lung and manifest the human gene. This’

is an essential step toward testing gene trans-
fer in human Gaucher patients,” Barranger
said.

Currently, Barranger and collaborators at the
Pittsburgh Genetics Institute and the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are in
the review process to gain approval for a
human gene therapy trial involving Gaucher
disease patients to begin in 1993.

Golden Key
starts Project

TUTOR for

area children
By Todd Simmons ‘
For The Pitt News

Pitt students will be given an
opportunity next semester to do
some teaching of their own while
providing a needed service for a
Pittsburgh community.

Pitt’s Golden Key Honor Society
is gearing up for a program that its
is sponsoring called Project
TUTOR, or Teaching and
Understanding Through Out
Reach. The project will provide
funding for volunteer Pitt students
to tutor elementary and middle
school students in_Hazelwood.

“The projectis aimed at helping
students who arehaving difficulty
either at home or in school and
who also need some encourage-
ment and motivation to do home-
work,” said Tracy Clouse, presi-
dent of the honor society and
director of volunteer recruitment
for Project TUTOR

Clouse said the program is open
to any Pitt student interested in
tutoring children‘ in ‘kindergarten
through the ninthgrade.

“The project  unique"~~because
it’s receiving “from the uni-
versity for transportation and train-
ing,” Clouse said. “The university
typically leaves it up to the stu-
dents to be responsible for their
own transportation in projects like
The university,,wil_l"also sponsor
two two-hour workshops, includ-
ing a one—hour session at one of
the schools in Hazelwood
to help volunteers prepare for
tutoring.

Volunteers in the projects pilot
term next semester will concen-

.trate.on helping students with their

reading and writing skills, tutoring
students twice a week.

Pittsburgh Councilman Bob
O’Connor from Squirrel Hill is sup-
porting Project TUTOR and will be
speaking about the program at a
volunteer interest meeting to be
held the week of Jan. 11.

In January, all first-year students will be

receiving safety guides in the mail. Created by
four members of the Student Government
Board Public Safety Committee,
Committee chair Shahla Eberhardt said that
these booklets are targeted toward ﬁrst—year
students because that is when safety instruc-
tion is most important

She said that the idea is to teach
first-year students all aspects of safety so they
will keep the knowledge with them during
their next four years. The booklet will also be
available for upperdass students, Eberhardt
said

Included in this guide are many items that
can help students become aware of problems .

on campus.
There is a top—1O list of items that are most

often stolen on campus and a list of top—1O
places where those items are most often
taken from.

Eberhardt said this will heighten the aware-
ness of students about what they should look

.out for and might spur them to take extra

precautions.

There are a lot of littie facts added in the
guide that students are not aware of, she said.

For instance — Operation ID. This is
where students can go to the Department of
Public Safety and have them engrave social
security numbers on personal property, or
students can check out an engraver and do it
themselves, she said -

The guide also has sections dealing with
rape, sexual assault and safe sex. Many times
these issues are lectured to students, by adults
instead of being discussed student to student.
This is a more personal basis, she said

“Maybe [students] will be more likely to lis-

ten to what we have to say,” Eberhardt mid
“Or at least consider it a little more.”

Eberhardt said this guide is not meant to
preach but to open students’ eyes.

Also in the guide is a sticker with emer-
gency phone numbers, a phone list with
numbers dealing with safety issues and a
Community Observation fomr. This form is to
be filled out by students when they see suspi-
cious activity or a crime being committed,
then it is to be turned in to the Department of
Public Safety.

On the back of the guide is a safety map
that shows where the bike routes, the safe
walking routes and campus phones are
located.

The idea was created by SGB and then
passed down to the committee. Eberhardt
said that Lisa Raff, Holly Callender, Vonai
Shumba and herself began working on this
project last March.

By Sandra M. O’Toole
For The Pitt News

The sun’s morning light illuminates a white castle of
glass, inviting the sleepy-eyed patron to begin a peaceful
journey to faraway lands.

At’_the Phipps Conservatory Winter Flower SlIow,
cathedral ceilings echo songs of Christmas greetings
throughout a forest of palm trees reaching upward to
domes of glass touching the heavens.

“The conservatory is one of only three glass house
conservatories in the United States; they’re really a rare
and precious facility,” said Christine Kirby, Phipps
Conservatory development supervisor.

A maze of walkways leads as far as the imagination

‘will follow. A host of Christmas trees in colorful pinks,
purples and blues with a panda bear theme sparks
weary eyes and minds to life. The “Purple Panda” and
“Panda Tales” puppet shows will entertain and educate
the young at heart throughout December.

“The whole idea of the panda bears was that it is a
rare and precious creature, just like tlIe facility,” Kirby

University of Pittsburgh.

The Cathedral was not
opened until 1938, Bruhns
said, due to the fact that
during the Depression con-
struction stopped. A huge
steel skeleton decorated the
university skyline for at
least two years, but the
communities in and sur-
rounding Pittsburgh rallied
to finish the tower.

“Chancellor Bowman
wanted the people of the
community to take part in
the building of the
Cathedral and send their
children [to Pitt],” Bruhns
said.

However, the building of
the Cathedral was not easy.

said. “Our main concern is
conservation, people really
need to rally around these
ideas and institutions.”

One enters a room of light

and sound where droplets‘

falling softly from fountains
to a water garden of poinset-
tias and berries soothe the
ears. Reindeer of moss and
ivy peek out from the rich
greens of an African jungle.
Thick, moist air, the bright
hue of ﬂowers in bloom and
the sweet smell of orchids
intoxicate the senses.

“Really, it’s just a place
where you can escape the

cold weather and enjoy the..-

Originally, it was thought
that the 14-acre site that had
been chosen for the great
building was filled with
quicksand. Upon further
investigation, Bowman
stunned his opponents
with the news that core
drilling results had revealed
a 40-foot—thick layer of alu-
minum silicate under the
sand, which would easily
support the structure,
Bruhns said.

Delays did not stop there.
Bruhns explained, “Each
stone was cut and marked
as to which place it should
go during the construction,
such as A13. During the
Depression, when construc-
tion froze, the numbers

began to wear off  leaving
a huge puzzle.” Bowman
quickly remedied the situa-
tion as each number had to
be immediately repainted
with waterproof paint, she
said.

Through the setbacks,
Bowman remained ‘deter-
minedto solve the chronic
space shortage that Pitt
faced and increase the
enrollment of the university.
Bowman wished to make a
statement about Pittsburgh
and higher education.

go straight up, never reach-
ing a point,” she said. “This
was a symbol of Chancellor
Bowman’s belief that higher
education is a never-ending

process.”

The building of the
Cathedral was a process
which involved the entire
community. “Workers from
all over the city offered to
give up meat for a week
and donate the money to
the university. People said,
‘I won’t buy a new winter
coat this year,’ so they were
able to donate,” Bruhns
said. Bowman was even
chauffeured through the city
in a fire truck as the fire-
fighters whizzed through
red lights, sirens screaming
their devotion to the com-
pletion of the educational

tower.

“At least 97,000 school
children from the Pittsburgh

area donated 10 cents each
to buy a brick which would
be used in the building
of the Cathedral,” Bruhns
said. “The children had to
write a letter explaining
how they had earned the 10
cents, and in return they
received certificates,”
proclaiming them to be
builders of the Cathedral of
Learning.

From the ground floor to
the Babcock Room on the
-42nd floor, the Cathedral of
Learning houses more than
300 classrooms. According
to records, Chancellor
Bowman said that the “uni-
versity will express its ideals
with the building of this
cathedral.”

people you trust,” said T om
Misuraca, advisor to the Pitt
Program Council. PPC is run-
ning trips to Panama City and

Cancun this year.

-“PPC is one of Intercampus’
la travel wholesaler] biggest
Spring Break accounts in
Florida. We get what we ask
for,” Misuraca said.

“This year we are trying
something new by going to
Cancun,” Misuraca said. “This
is what the students are look-
ing for, so this is what we’ll
give them. We don’t make
any money on our trips.

“No matter where you go it
comes down to who do you
wanna give your money to.”

Tom Webster ,who went to
Panama City last year with
PPC, said “It was great. The
Holiday Inn was incredible
and was nice knowing there
was someone around in case
you needed help.”

PPC has at least one univer-
sity administrator on call at all
times in case of an emer-
gency, Misuraca said. “Not all
tours have.someone you can
turn to if you need help.”

Misuraca offered some
advice for traveling abroad.
First, make sure you bring an
original birth certiﬁcate and
second form of identification,
such as your driver’s license.
Second, no matter where you
are going, remember to bring
an insurance card, he said.

Jennifer Ames and Christy
Mascom, who went to
Cancun with a Canada based
company, found out the hard
way what can happen when
you travel. “We waited 17
hours in the airport, and our
[representative] kept giving us
the nm around,” Ames said.
“Then when we got there the
hotel was a hole,” Mascom
said. .

Although it is’ nice to go to
a faraway island or live it up
in a ﬁve star hotel in Florida,
that is not the only way to
have fun during Spring Break.

“This year, me and my
friends are going to get in a
van, throw some clothes and
a few cases of beer in the
back and head for a friend’s
house in Daytona. We’ll see
what happens when we get
there,” Ames said.

in just a few short years. It’s only logical that the conductor of
this downturn — Coach Paul Hackett — would be removed
for the troubles facing this dying program.

Immediately following Hackett’s ﬁring, the search started
for a replacement — but not just any replacement. This com-
mittee wants a coach who can win — and win big.
Coaching legends with names like Majors and Sherrill have
been tossed around daily and it’s literally a matter of hours
before Pitt names its new messiah.

While we hardly were fans of Hackett and agreed with his
ﬁring, the names being tossed around scare us even more.
For all of the non-football fans out there, the names men-
tioned are as synonymous with cheating as they are with
winning. The one good thing we can say about Paul Hackett
is that at least he realized that his players were students as
well as athletes.

We are doubtﬁil that these other coaches will be commit-
ted to maintaining the academic standards handedto them
from their predecessor. Andthey may even go so far as to
say that the academicstandards established during his tenure
Were at least in part responsible for the program’s. fall.

The fact is, however, that Hackett was a bad head coach.
There is no proof that shows that high academic standards
and a losing football program are one and the same.
Besides, once the NCAA raises its standards to the same level

ier time maintaining it. Other schools’ athletes, on the other
l1ar1'c;l:-',»““""inay ﬁnd themselves ﬂoundering to bring up their
QPAs to meet the new requirement.

In the end we have to ask, what is the purpose of this uni-
versity? While it would be nice to have a winning football
team it cannot be at the cost of the standards that the Pitt ath-
letic program has set for itself. Those higher standards not
only .reﬂect on the athletic program, but on the university as
a whole. Is a winning football team worth being associated
with a substandard university?

We don’t think that it is, and we hope that Chancellor
O’Connor will stick to his guns and override any decision
which places winning ahead of academic performance. A 2.3

‘ . j is not a 4.0, and a 750 SAT is not a 1600.'It only goes to

prove that Pitt wants to remain an above-average institution.
Teams like Duke, Stanford and Notre Dame have been win-.
ning with high standards for years. We wouldn’t mind ﬁnd-
ing ourselves mentioned in the same breath as those schools.
We have to start somewhere. How about right now?

Sexual harrasment on Capitol Hill

Now age 32, Tiffany Work
recalls her encounter with
sexual harassment at the age
of 13. In 1973, she was fon-
dled by the freshman senator
from Oregon, Bob Packwood.
Work joins the growing num-
ber of women coming for-
ward this year who are freely
discussing sexual advances of
the recently re-elected sena-
tor.
apparently still fresh."

Other allegations include
Packwood chasing a worker
around the office, as well as
grabbing and forcibly kissing
a lobbyist. In all, over 15
women have issued state-
ments concerning Senator
Packwo'0d’s sexual miscon-
duct.

‘After Anita Hill’s testimony
regarding then-Supreme
Court-nominee Clarence
Thomas’ behavior, sexual
harassment in politics is no
longer a taboo notion.
Women have gained the con-
fidence to come forward.
Although Hill was attacked,

her strength and integrity -

served as a role model for
women who no longer will
accept unwanted sexual
advances.

Currently the Senate Ethics
Committee is charged with the
responsibility to investigate
allegations of misconduct,
however, it hesitates to accept
this task. The committee’s
inquiry into the affairs of one
of its colleagues worries many
members of the old boys con-
gressional network.

Now the senators and repre-
sentatives may have to take
responsibilities for all of their
actions.

Starting off the 103rd
Congress are a number of
alleged ethics violations. For
example, Sen. Inouye of
Hawaii faces similar sexual
harassment charges, Texas
Sen. Phil Gramm, a high-rank-
ing Republican, supposedly

accepted favors from a con- g
tractor in return for help with ‘

The 24-year ‘incumbent

a failed Savings and Loan.
Inertia is unacceptable.
Public officials must be
accountable for their actions.
The Senate finds itself in a
difficult position. Political
constraints shape possible
action by the Ethics
Committee. For example,
political rivalries can unfold
during proceeding. Party affil-
iations could cloud judgment
against offenders. '
Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen
Specter demonstrated how

Mark Smith
  and

  Julie Sabol

political allegiance can inﬂu-
ence Senate proceedings.
Specter played a pivotal role
in discrediting Anita Hill. Now
that American allegiance has
shifted away from the
Republicans, Democrats are in
the position to exploit the
Packwood allegations.

Other constraints make
investigations difficult.
Senators and other public offi-
cials fall outside the rules
governing sexual harassment
in the federal government. By
their very nature, elected offi-
cials cannot be fired for
improper actions, including
those of sexual harassment.
This limits the Senate’s
options and public account-
ability. Sen. ‘Packwood will
most likely be representing
Oregon in the Senate until
1998. '

The Senate can reprimand
Packwood. This could run the
gamut from a formal censure
to an informal, inside slap on
the wrists. While censure
offers the harshest action pos-
sible, it is unlikely. And a slap
on the wrist will not discour-
age further misconduct by
other congressional represen-
tatives.

The committee should take

the initiative to create a new

would

policy to be followed by all
congressional members. A
definite statement of the intol-
erance of sexual harassment
and the procedure to be fol-
lowed for those violating it is

.a good start so that men such

as Packwood will not be in
office for over three decades
continually harassing women.
At this point, a greater
understanding of sexual

harassment is needed to craft.

a policy. Many women are
reluctant to come forward
because sexual harassment
has always been considered
part of the job description for
working women. ’

It was only in 1980 that the
Equal Employment Opportun-
ity Commission issued a state-
ment concerning sexual
harassment. Eleanor Norton
Holmes, Clarence Thomas’
predecessor in the EEOC, cre-
ated guidelines for the work-
place.

With the Clinton administra-
tion for ethics in government,
which has been missing for
the past 12 years, a solution
seems feasible.

Working with the Senate and‘

the EEOC, Clinton should take
the lead to create a govern-
ment where women can work
without the fear of unwanted
kisses and running around the
office.

As for Packwood, a new
sexual harassment policy
not affect him.
However, action can and
should be taken. Packwood
has checked himself into an
alcohol rehabilitation pro-
gram.’

This is good if he has a
drinking problem, but it
appears his problems extend
beyond alcoholism. Packwood
should accept responsibility
for his actions and resign.

dent in the school ofpuhlic

Pitt volleyball overcomes  

youth in strong season

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

Through the wreckage of the Stanford loss last Friday in
the NCAA Tournament, the Pitt volleyball team had noth-
ing to be ashamed of. Its season had been a success.

Losing six seniors from the 1991 squad, including cap-
tains and solid middle hitters Sue Zonneville and Dee
MacAulay, the 1992 season looked like a rebuilding year.

Then first—year recruit and sensational middle hitter
Jennie Driscoll went down with a shoulder injury and was
forced to sit out the entire ‘92 campaign. The season
looked bleaker. _

The only experience the Panthers possessed were junior
outside hitter Ann Marie Lucanie and sophomore setter
Annie Mernagh. The fall of ‘92 was not only a rebuilding
run or bleak compared to past years, it was going to be
the Lucanie and Co. show and the wizardry of head coach
Sue Woodstra.

The 1992 season in review:

A ROUGH SEPTEMBER.

Playing in Nebraska at any time of the year is tough, but
opening a season in Huskerland is suicide. The young
Panthers dropped all three matches in the Firstier
Invitational, but the experience may have done them
good. Tough opponents and a young team don’t mix. Pitt
0-3.

September continued with another tournament. This
time the opponents were easier, but the Panthers still
struggled. Winning over the likes‘ of Miami—Ohio and
Northern Illinois, Pitt had its first two wins of the season.
A crushing loss to Purdue gave Pitt the second place tro-
phy. Still struggling. Pitt 2-4.

After beating the less-talented teams of Duquesne and
American University, the Panthers made history in the
worst way — a loss. Against the Wildcats of Villanova,

Woodstralost her first Big East match ever. Pitt, however,

Paul couldn’t, Hack-ett. The
defense couldn’t stop it. The
special teams couldn’t return
it. The offense couldn’t put it
in the end zone
enough.

Not getting it done made
the 1992 Pitt football season
one to forget — so let’s have
one last review and be done
with it.

LIGHTS OUT.

September 5: The Panthers
snuffed out a lightweight
squad from Kent State. Alex

"Van Pelt began another sea-

son of stat—padding by com-
pleting 11 of 17 passes for
270 yards and three touch-
downs. Curtis Martin caught
one of those scoring tosses —

_a leaping 29-yard snag —— and V

ran for three more.

As they ran up the score
against a patsy, the Panthers
suffered one of their worst
losses of the season.

Linebacker Tom Tumulty tore _

a pectoralis muscle as he
tried to make a tackle in the

was a problem all year. (1-0)

BACKYARD BLOWOUT.
September 12: West Virginia ran over the
Panthers 44-6, the biggest blowout in the history

of the rivalry.

“They came into our house and kicked our
butts,” Pitt strong safety Doug Whaley said.”

Hoops visits Hoyas in Big East opener

By Rob Pugliese
Sports Assistant

For its earliest Big East
confrontation ever, Pitt
would probably rather go
somewhere else.

In fact, Pitt would gladly
go anywhere but the snake
pit it will enter tonight.

It seems

Nobody realizes all this
better than the Panthers,
who, at least on the surface,
appear excited about the
chaﬂenge.

“I think we were looking
at that from day one -— the
early matchup with
Georgetown,” forward
Antoine Jones said. “You

time to be hitting them
though. I don’t even know
where the school’s from that
they played today, other
than it’s from New Orleans. I
never heard of it. I don’t
think they’ve played any real
competition yet so that
might be a change for
them.”

BACK ON TRACK?

September 28: A fired—up
Panther team charged out of
the gate to a 31-3 halftime
lead and held on for a 41-33
victory over Minnesota.

The Panthers pounded
away for 596 total offensive
yards. Van Pelt threw for
364 of them and three
touchdowns —— one of them
an electrifying 58-yard
catch-and—run by sophomore
wide receiver Dietrich jells.
Another sophomore, tail-
back Tim Colicchio, rolled

yard effort in the place of a
beat-up Martin. (2-2)

SHELL-SHOCKED.

Quarterback John Kaleo

Van Pelt threw for 395

YAWN.

October 17: Van Pelt led
a masterful two-minute drill
for the winning score as
time ran out to give Pitt a
27-20 victory over Temple
in this matchup of strug-
gling teams.

Owl, kicker Rich Maston
tied the game at 20 with a
32-yard field goal with only
1:38 remaining. The
Panthers charged 80 yards
in nine plays for the win-
ning score — a one-yard
plunge by first-year fullback
Lyron Brooks with 13 sec-
onds left. A

Van Pelt completed six of
seven passes on the drive,
21 of 33 for 259 yards on
the day. (3-4)

UGLY. 1

October 24: Billy Davis
fumbled the opening kick-
off, and East Carolina scored
four plays later. That was
the fitting beginning for an
ugly 37-31 Panther loss.
The-pass-to—the-flat-inter-
cepted-and-returned-for—a-
touchdown bug bit Van Pelt
again. The defense played
relatively well against an
explosive Pirate offense, but
Pitt made enough mistakes

to lose one that was not as ‘

close as the score.‘ (3-5)
NIGHTMARE.-

October 31: A Halloween
visit to Syracuse turned
nightmarish as the
Orangemen ran all over the
Panthers 41-10. Two
Syracuse defenders made a
Van Pelt sandwich and
knocked him out inthe sec-
ond quarter. The Panthers
never stopped the Orange
running attack, and the spe-
cial teams were horrible.

“No question we fell apart
[on special teams],” Hackett
said. “The special teams
took us completely out of
the ballgame today.” (3-6)

GAVE IT AWAY.

November 14: Mistakes
— especially five Van Pelt
interceptions —— plagued the
Panthers as a 31-16 loss to
Louisville and the frigid
weather turned this into a
chilling day for Pitt.

“I let the team down
today. It’s the worst game I
ever played as a Panther,”
Van Pelt said.

With the score tied at 10,

that famous play — a Van
Pelt interception returned
for a touchdown — struck

again to give Louisville the
lead. Van Pelt also threw
interceptions to set up
scores on the next two
Panther possessions, and
the competitive part of the
game was over. (3-7)

opposition ranks among the weakest in all
of college basketball. This season was no
different. Saturday the Hoyas defeated
Southern of New Orleans 96-57.

First-year phenom Othella Harrington put
up the first of what will be many double-
doubles by scoring 23 points and grabbing
12 rebounds to go with five blocks and
three steals.

In their opener, the Hoyas demolished St.
Leo 88-49 riding the wave of Harrington’s
impressive debut. He led all scorers with 20
points while pulling down six boards,
blocking five shots and ripping off four
steals.

In recent seasons, John Thompson’s Hoyas
have been a serviceable lot of role-players
blended around dominating big men. In
1992 not much has changed.

It all revolves around Harrington, a 6—foot-
10-inch’ center out of Jackson, Mississippi.
Harrington brings a sculpted physique and
tough rebounding skills in his quest to suc-
ceed Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo and

Alonzo Mourning as the next great
Hoya center. All indications are that he has
the skills to continue that superstar tradi-
tion.

Joining him on the frontline is another
diaper dandy, 6’10” forward Duane Spencer
from Crescent City, Louisiana. Unlike
Harrington, however, Spencer is thin as a
toothpick and needs to bulk up. He pulled
down 10 rebounds against St. Leo and cur-
rently averages nine points per game.

The potential difference on this club is
perimeter play.

While Thompson lacks a real outside scor-
er, he does possess capable weapons in
Robert Churchwell and Church. Churchwell,
a 6’6” junior forward scored close to 10
points per contest last season and is off to a
solid start with a 12-point average through
two games. 1

Church gives the Hoyas their lone three-
point threat — nailing 52 treys a year ago;
but Brown is the real key." The 5’10” junior
floor general has developed nicely and

evened its Big East record.
After another win against
Akron, Pitt faced Providence.
Coming out on the wrong side

match skid. Slip sliding away.
Pitt 7-8, 1-2.

Not only did the ND tourna-
ment turn the Panthers
around, it made them do a fast
about-face. Whipping Hofstra,
Big East rival Syracuse and
Rhode Island, Pitt was getting
into the groove. After a tough
loss to Loyola-Chicago, the
Panthers bounced back to fin-
ish off the month by destroy-
ing Seton Hall. The Panthers
were making their Big East
move. Pitt 11-10, 3-2.

Player outlook — first—year
players Sara Mitchell (outside
hitter) and Sarah Mikla (mid-
dle hitter) improved consider-
ably while Pitt’s youth gained
experience.

A SUPERB NOVEMBER.

Keeping its Big East winning
streak going, Pitt won a
marathon match against
Connecticut. After beating
West Virginia, the Panthers
took it to an overwhelmed
Georgetown squad. That win

gave the Panthers their fifth
straight Big East regular sea-
son title. Pitt kept on rolling.
Pitt 14-10, 5-2.

Slipping a little in mid-
November, Pitt fell to
Maryland, Arkansas St. and
William and Mary but
rebounded back against
Memphis state to close out the
regular season. After winning
four Big East matches in a
row, Pitt headed into the con-
ference tournament seeded
No. 1. The Panthers gear up to
defend their title. Pitt 15-13,
5-2.

The Big East Tourney —
Whether it was bouncing back
from their mid—November
slump or the fact that their Big
East title was on the line, the
Panthers raised their game to
another level and made this
year’s ‘92 round robin a fiasco.

Hammering Boston College,
Syracuse and Providence in
succession, Woodstra’s war-
riors had battled back all sea-
son long to claim the tourna-

time. Peaking at the right
moment. Pitt 18-13, 5-2.

Player outlook — Mernagh,
who played well all season,
really turned it on in
November, and her setting
helped Pitt’s slow-starting mid-
dle attack as well as Lucanie
did. Melanie Gustafson and
Laura Horvath also stepped up
their play as the Panthers
made their run for the NCAAs.

DECEMBER FUN AND SUN.

The NCAAS — Going to
California any time to play
volleyball is not like the
Nebraska suicide the Panthers
faced early in the season,
rather it is mass murder. Out-
classed and out—pointed by the
Stanford super power, Pitt lost
in the first round of the 32-
team tournament. Pitt 18-14,
5-2.

As the season began, the Pitt

 

volleyball team was in dire
straits. They were young and
inexperienced. They were in
for a long season. But Sue
Woodstra turned back the
adversity. She turned her team
into Big East champions and
NCAA qualifiers.

This season saw Lucanie
collect award after award
while fine—tuning her skills
and becoming one of the top
players in the country.

Mernagh was steady and
solid all year. Her setting late
in the season allowed Pitt to
be successful. But it was the
development of fi_rst—year
players Mikla, Mitchell and
Yanik that allowed the
Panthers to improve as the
season went on. All three fac-
tors, plus Woodstra, provided
the basis for a victorious year
in 1993.

up the Panthers with a dev-
astating running game that
piled up 374 yards in a 57-

Pitt.

While All—American
ﬂanker O.J. McDuffie broke
four team records and tail-
back Richie Anderson ram-
bled for 131 yards, fullback

COULDN’T HACKETT.

“I think it is important that .

you have a balance, and

POST-MORTEM.

The Panthers finished the
season 3-9. There were
bright spots and some out-
standing individual perfor-
mances — special mention
to Jells and Conley.

Now all that remains is to
step out of the rubble into
the future of Pitt football.
Whether it is a Major move
to the past, a new Sunseri
rising or some other new
beginning, the Panthers’
place as a major college
football program hangs pre-
cariously in the balance.

should give Thompson stability. A
tenacious defender with nice ba1lhan-
dling skills, Brown uses strength to
wear other point guards down.

Although his numbers are not
huge, Brown does not make crucial
mistakes — especially down the
stretch.

The Panthers have played well in
stretches, but need more consistency
on both ends of the floor tonight.

Evans has used the early season to
try various combinations, and
Saturday’s win over Marshall marked
the first time this season which Evans
played his starting lineup extensive-
ly, with three starters seeing 32 min-
utes or more.

Despite its historical road woes,
Pitt appears confident and mentally
prepared headi .1g into this matchup.
Georgetown boasts Harrington, yet
the Panthers’ biggest advantage
could be on the boards.

“I think that’s a big plus,” forward
Chris McNeal said. “They only have
one big guy. We have three guys that
can go to theglass. I don’t know

what else they have at the other
positions, but I know Mobley can
handle Harrington.

“They’re gonna have to worry
about Jones and myself, and maybe
that will be an advantage for us. But
we’re still gonna attack the glass, and
hopefully-we can find some mis-
matches, and they can’t find anybody
to block us out.”

Point guard play could decide this
game. Sophomore Jerry “Ice”
McCullough is off to an impressive
start with 18 points and four—and—a-
half rebounds per game.

He needs another smooth floor
game against Brown for Pitt to pull
off the mild upset.

Evans is concerned about
turnovers, since Pitt had 24 against
Marshall and always. seems to strug-
gle with the Hoya press.

“We get 24 against these guys and
they don’t press you,” he said after
the Marshall game. “We could have
50 [Wednesday]. I thought Antoine
was gonna get a triple-double tonight
with turnovers.”

Jones did turn it over seven times,-

but also contributed a strong all-
around effort with 13 points, 10
rebounds and more outstanding
defense.

Jones cautioned that this must be a
solid team effort for Pitt and not
evolve into a giant confrontation
between two of the league’s best big
men. However, Pitt’s offensive
options flow much smoother when
junior center Eric Mobley is in the
flow. '

“It’ll be even better for us if he’s
playing well,” Jones said. “We can’t
really put all the pressure on E
[Mobley]. Everybody else has to do
what they have to do. We just have
to prepare as a team going into
Georgetown Wednesday, and every-
thing else will take care of itself.”

If it comes down to free throw
shooting, then Pitt must feel comfort-
able. The Panthers are just under 80
percent thus far as a team.

“It’s been good, really throughout
_,the preseason. It’s been good in
practice,” Evans said. “I think if we

just don’t talk about it we might be

alright.”
