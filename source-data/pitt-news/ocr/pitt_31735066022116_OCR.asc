By Stephanie Lyle

For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Crisis Center '

works 24 hours a day trying to
help suicidal teen-agers "cope
with their problems.

The 16-year-old crisis center i_s

the only crisis center in western .

Pennsylvania accredited and
recognized by the American Or-

- ganization of Suicidology. The

24-hour phone service empha-
sizes general, crisis and suicide
counseling and handles a rate of
20,000 calls a year.

Norma Coleman, the director
of the program said, ”Twenty

thousand calls a year is a definite —

increase compared to previous
years, but we can still accomo-
date many more. Because of the
recent attention being given to
' the problem of teen suicide, we
have been receiving an increase
in calls. These incidents have

Brutus receives Langston Hughesaward  

Dennis Brutus, chairman of
Pitt's department of black com-
munity-education research and
development, is to be awarded
the Langston Hughes Medallion
by The City College of New York.
The medallion, presented annu-
ally, will be awarded to Brutus
Wednesday, April 8 at the Col-
lege's 12th annual Langston
Hughes Festival.

Brutus, an exiled South African

A activist and political prisoner, will
be honored for his significant
contribution to the arts and letters
and for his diligent work to end
apartheid in South Africa.

The Langston Houghes Medal-

created more emotional upsets.” .

Coleman said, however, that
most of the calls have been from
a third party who is concerned
about a teen. ’ _

The 24-hour program is a
phone service run by trained
volunteers. ”The volunteers must
meet our specific criteria,” ex-
plained Coleman. ”The volun-
teers must go through a 50-hour
basic training program taught by
professionals and then. do a
24-hour internship under the
direct supervision of an ex-
perienced volunteer.”

The crisis center_ also offers a
referral service of self-help groups
and therapists. ",We look at our-
selves as a bridge between the
caller and the professionals,” said
Coleman. ‘ _

”Eight out of 10. suicide at-
tempts are successful, which is
considerably high,” explained
Coleman. ”So it is important to

Brutus graduated from Fort
Hare University in South "Africa
with a bachelor's degree in En-

glish and psychology. He taught ‘

for 13 years in South Africa and
has also taught at Northwestern
University and Swar_thn_1ore_Co_l-_

changes early on.” “

Some of these changes Cole-
man speaks of include: becoming
withdrawn or overly animated;
isolation from family and friends;
avoiding social events; giving
away possessions; academic
changes (ie. dropping grades or
lower attendance); drug or alco-
hol problems; lax- in personal
grooming; _taking unnecessary
risks; hostile attitudes and
depression.

”Some signs are not always

. clear,” points out Coleman. ”For

example, if someone who has
been severly depressed sudden-
ly becomes happy and optimistic,
he or she may be contemplating
suicide. Usually in the‘ height of

;a depression a plan cannot be for-
/

vmalized, but afterward, when

calmed, a plan may be conjured
up. These are things to be think-
ing about when. dealing with

University of Pittsburgh in 1986.

Brutus has been a main propo-
nent for excluding South Afr_ica

1964. He has testified before
Congress an_d the United Nations
on South Africa's racial policies
and human rights--violations and
on the effectiveness of sanctions
and divestments. ' ' ‘

depression.”

. Statistics show that the numbei
of successful suicides is highest
among young white males 15 to
19 years old, while teen-age girls
have the highest number of at-
tempts. For every completed

male suicide, there are three fe-

male attempts._ Studies show that

' females usually choose less effec-

tive means than males.

”The reason given for attempt-~

ed teen-age suicides vary,” said
Coleman. ”The -reasons we hear
most often are: a sense of rejec-
tion or failure; _drug or alcohol
abuse; and loss of a boyfriend or
girlfriend. ‘ _
”Rejection and failure are the
most frequent of the three,” said
Coleman. ”The Child may not
have failed at all, but the pressure
of keeping up good gradeslor ex-’

L The arrival of spring brings with

it not only the return of the robins _

and perfect weather but also the
return to Oakland of the teen-age

’ gangs that caused so much trou-

ble last fall.
This past Saturday night, the
gangs terrorized Oakland Avenue

and caused damage to one local 7

bar-. A
’’It was like nothing I've ever
seen,” said Bob Bonesso,
manager of Peter's Pub, 1-Tl 6~'Oak-
land,Ave. ”There was at least a
minimum of 1 50  kids from the
corner of Fifth and Oakland to the

corner of Forbes and Oakland/’_.

Bonesso said most of the kids

appeared to be 15- or.16-year-L" ‘

olds whom he did not recognize
as neighborhood kids.
”They [were] walking the

streets harassing people, mostly.
If a person -can't feel 

safe  why go out?

girls,” he added. .. 

Bonesso said he first_cal|ed the
Pittsburgh Police at 9:30 pm.

whenthere were about 30 teen- 
agers. The police came and,

chased them away.
By 12:30 a.m. Bonesso said

there were at least 150 teen-agers  "

on Oakland Avenue. ‘ ’

”We tried to get them away” L in

from our door and away from our

sidewalk, and before you [knew] «  f_’
it, from everywhere came full '  

cans of beer and bottles,” he said.

Peter's Pub sustained $70  
worth of damage to the front win—   ff‘.
dows, and Bonesso said one cus'-  ;  

tomer had to get four stitches in
the chin and another suffered a

-cut to the side ofhis head near, :

his ear.

Bonesso asked. -

thinks it is because-they were"

Opponents of Contra aid vow to fight filibuster

WASHINGTON — Senate op-
ponents of Contra aid lost another
battle yesterday but said they
would fight on to break a
filibuster and compel President
Reagan to account for millions of
dollars in previous assistance
they say has disappeared.

-The vote on ending the fili-
buster was an even 50-50, 10
votes short of the 60 required.

The filibuster is preventing ac-
tion on legislation to freeze Con-
tra spending for six months and
to order a full accounting of how
previous aid was spent.

A first attempt to choke off the
filibuster failed on Monday when
46 senators voted to end the de-
bate and 45 voted to let it
continue.

Senate Majority Leader Robert
C. Byrd (D—W.Va.) said yesterday
that a third attempt to end the
filibuster will be made on Wed-
nesday.

Byrd made clear, however, that
the real goal now is to produce,
not 60 votes but 51, the ”con-
stitutional majority” that will be
all that is needed to reject the

president’s request for $105 mil-
lion when it reaches the Senate
floor later this year.

Contract regulation is

way to reduce hassles

HARRISBURG — A state law-
maker, citing problems raised by
a highly publicized surrogate
motherhood case in New Jersey,
said Tuesday that he has pro-
posed legislation that would le-
gally recognize surrogate-
parenting contracts.

Rep. Robert D. Reber Jr. (R-
Montgomery) said the state
should strictly regulate the
parenting contracts. He said the
legal status of such contracts has
yet to be defined by any state.

”New Jersey's Baby M case has
brought to the surface the many
problems and potential for dis-
aster that can result from sur-
rogate parenting contracts not

_strictly regulated by law,” Reber

said.

Russians con tinue to

expand their defense

WASHINGTON — The Soviet
Union expanded virtually every
part of its military arsenal last
year, in the process deploying in-
creasingly advanced weaponry
that undercuts the West’s ability
to deter war, the Pentagon said
yesterday.

From nuclear missiles and sub-
marines to jet aircraft and attack
helicopters, the Russian build-up
throughout 1986 was unrelenting
and went ”far beyond legitimate
requirements for defense,” the
‘Pentagon asserted in its annual
written assessment.

Workers bubble over

Pepsi-Coke Io ve affair

NORTHAMPTON, Mass. — A
settlement has been reached in a
damage suit filed by a Coca—Cola
bottling company worker who
claimed she was fired ‘after falling
in love with a Pepsi employee.

Attorneys for both sides
declined comment on the details
of the agreement, except to say
the settlement was ”satisfactory
to all parties.”

Amanda Cronin, 30, of North-
ampton, who was then Amanda
Blake, sought $600,000 damages
from the Coca—Cola Bottling Co.
of Northampton in 1985.

She claimed in her Hampshire

pany told her she either had to
break off her engagement to
David Cronin, who had left Coke
to work for Pepsi, persuade him
to quit his job with the competi-
tor or quit herself. .

Sunscreen offers greaseless protection

By Daniel Q. Haney

_ Associated Press Writer

SAN DIEGO - A dry powder
made of microscopic sponges
should help people avoid skin
cancer by providing a goo-free,
once—a—day way to put on sun-
screen, researchers said.

See Looking Beyond, page 6 '

The new product, which de-
velopers said will be on the mar-
ket in a year or so, lasts 12 hours,
won't come off in water and
eliminates the greasy coating that
makes regular sunscreen a
nuisance.

”|t’s got important possibili-
ties,”said Dr. Albert M. Kligman

of the University of Pennsylvania. 2

Associated Press Writer

SAN DIEGO — A new form of
therapy is for the first time provid-
ing some hope for victims of the

most common form of brain_

cancer, which until now has been
quickly and relentlessly fatal, a
researcher says.

Among the 60 patients who
have received the experimental
therapy so far is Dick _Howser,
who resigned as manager of the
Kansas City Royals baseball team
after attempting a comeback fol-

sunlight is valuable/’,

He said many people are need-
lessly exposing themselves to
skin cancer, simply because they
can't stand sunscreen that is
”gunky, greasy stuff.” With the
new product, ”Nobody will say,
‘I won't use this because it's too
oily.’ ” ‘

The new approach was deve-
loped by Advanced Polymer Sys-
tems of Redwood City and was
demonstrated Monday at a meet-
ing of the American Cancer
Society.

Exposure to sunshine increases
the odds of getting skin cancer.
More than 500,000 people each
year get skin cancer, and most
cases are easily curable basal or
squamouscell cancers. President
and Nancy Reagan and Vice
President George Bush allhave
had basal cell cancer, the most

lowing surgery.

Doctors are unsure whether
they have cu red anyone with the
new approach, but some of their
patients are still alive long after
such victims usually die.

The patients were treated at an
advanced stage of their disease,
when the expected survival is 14
weeks. But some are apparently
free of disease more than two
years later. I

The therapy uses a newly de-
veloped technique to rally the
body's own immune defenses to
fight cancer. In this case, it's be-

common and most curable type.
But about 26,000 Americans get
malignant melanoma, a danger-
ous tumor that's fatal if allowed
to spread.

Advanced Polymer’s research
director, chemist Sergio Nacht,
said the secret to the new sun-
screen is tiny plastic sponges.

These are spheres about 16
one-hundredths of an'inch across.
When magnified 5,000 times,
they look something like golf
balls. Each one is covered with
250,000 little pores. The pores of
just one sponge, if laid back—to—
back, would measure 10 feet
long.

The sponges are soaked with li-
quid sun screen, which is slowly
released during the day as peo-
ple move about. -

”The mere movement of mus-
cles will tend to squeeze the tiny

ing used to attack brain tumors
called gliomas. About 15,000

sponges,” allowing the sunscreen
to ooze out, said Nacht.
I When applied to the skin in
powder form, the sunscreen
quickly disappears, leaving the
skin feeling dry but slightly slip-
pery. Nacht said the powder
could be added to many liquids,
so this form of sunscreen could
become a part of body creams,
eye makeup and aftershave lo-
tion, among other cosmetics.

”We have the technology to
entrap sunscreen, to put it on top
of the skin and to maintain it for
protracted periods of time and,
most importantly, to formulate it
into a very acceptable product
that will be cosmetically ade-
quate for children and adults,”
Nacht said.

In a separate report, Dr. Darrell
S. Rigel of New York University

" Medical Center said the melano-

ing the treatment in February
1985 at the Huntington Medical
Research Institutes in. Pasadena,
Calif. He described his results at
a meeting of the American
Cancer Society.

”|t’s not a panacea,” he said.
”lt’s highly experimental. But in
a disease that's heretofore been
100 percent fatal, at least for the
first time there's some hope for
these people.” '

The approach, called adoptive
Jmmunotherapy, uses’ the pa-
tient’s own white blood cells as
the primary assault against

ma rate is rising. He said the dis-
ease takes many years to develop,
and the jump probably results
from people's increased sun ex-

posure during the 1950s and‘

19605.

’’People wanted to look tanned
and beautiful,” he said. ”Hope-
fully, people are becoming more
aware, and we will see a
change/’

He said that currently, one in

135 Americans will get melano-
ma, a type of tumor, some time
during their lives. By the year

2000, he predicted that this

woLild increase to one in 90.
He also noted that people who

Drawing a line——

AIDS and ethics-

_ r

I g  T learn that humanists themselves

Recently, the question of whether an AIDS patient should
be given the same priority on the waiting list for organ dona-
tions as a patient without AIDS was raised. Thomas Starzl, a

' surgeon in the transplant unit at Presbytarian-University Hospital

in Oakland, stated that he felt AIDS victims should not be dis-
criminated against in such a manner. .

In the face of a disease with a nil cure rate, it could be as-
sumed that the disease should not be treated as a disability but

. as a fatal illness. Presently, an inescapably fatal illness.

» , At. some point in the ethical discussion at hand, someone is
=sure‘-to.raise-the point of the uselessness of keepinga patient
‘alive to suffer the pain of an AIDS-related deterioration. At this
point, keeping in mind that there is no cure for the disease,
it would make much more sense to award the organ to the per-
son most likely to survive the operation, both the actual proce-
dure and after release.

. The question of- ethics would seem to take the stage at this
point. If a surgeon decides not to award the transplant to a pa-
tient becauseof another disease, is he discriminating on the
basis of a handicap? Where should the line be drawn between
helping everyone and allocating the available resources,

._ markedly a scarse commodity.

In the event that there are two candidates for an organ, one
with «AIDS and one without, the healthier of the two should
be given the organ." It is not.an easy decision, or an enviable
one, but a necessary one in the light of the current fatality rate

Secular Humanism

In his March T8 column, Mat-

: thew Thornton questions the re-

cent Alabama_ court decision
ruling that humanism is a religion

I and suggests that humanists

themselves should decide
whether their system of beliefs is
a religion. .

He should have done a little

more research before writing his_

column. It may surprise him to

have indeed identified humanism
as a religion. I have before me a

1 copy of the first Humanist
Manifesto, published »in 1933,

which consistently refers to hu-
manism-as a religion (14 times by

; imylcount).

Perhaps’ Mr. Thornton feels that
an atheistic system such as hu-

I  manism cannot be a religion. I

could point to Unitarianism as a
legally recognized religion which
does not affirm the existence of
a deity. Indeed, denial of the ex-

istence of God is as much a state-. .

 

ment of faith as affirmation of

"God.

The signatories of the 1.933 Hu-
manist Manifesto were likewise
untroubled by a godless religion.
They offer a definition of religion
as a ”means for realizing the
highest values in life,’’ involving
a ’’world view, a sense of values”
and a method ”for realizing the
satisfactory life.” Later on, a
definiton is given: ”Religion con-
sists of those actions, purposes
and experiences which are hu-
manly significant.”

Mr. Thornton could have made
a short trip to Hillman Library, as
I recently did, to look over the hu-
manist publications. He would
have found many books and es-
says written by modern hu-
manists identifying humanism as

a religion (including a publication

by the Humanist Society of

Bully on the mental block I

American public education can
no longer be permitted to stag-
nate. The board of public educa-
tion and the teachers unions are
guided by slavish and historic
concepts that do not measure up
to the times. Confusion will ac-
cumulate under pressure of the
health care problem and the
budget cuts —— budget cuts that
feed the gun machines while
starving the minds of our coun-
try. This confusion will reinforce

the extremely weird politics of

the extremely shrill, among
whom I include Republican red-
baiters, LaRouche and Fun-
damentalists. These pressure
groups seize upon any fear, any
confusion, to advance their polit-
ics. Meanwhile, ‘I recommend
that the Pittsburgh Board of Edu-
cation take a reasonable look at
itself and try to undo its basic
quality of negligence.

There are several areas of negli-
gence. The absence of reasonably
involved sex education is one,
the incapacity to deal with drugs
is another. It is an older problem,
one linked to drugs, however,

‘which is at root the rot of the

schools. This is the manner in

JAMES cnAnv

which school teachers and ad-
ministrators deal with the bully of
the class. Due to their ineptitude,
children do not learn how to deal
with the bully. -

It will be ‘my opinion that our
educational policies are so back-
ward, arcane and ridiculous that
teachers are mainly hamstrung,
literally forced to be negligent. By
refusing to address the problem
of schoolyard bu|lydom,Iwhere
drug trade often originates, the
Board of Public Education literal-
ly dooms a sizeable number of its
random students to complete vic-
timization. Where do they turn?

A young _caller to Mike Royko
from the Chicago Tribune was
distressed to the point that she
wanted to end her life, and he
was so selfish and ignorant that
he couldn't even transfer her call
properly.

There are several ways that the
Board of Education reinforces the
violence in the schools, the most
obvious one being the stance
they take in order to disguise do-

is a religion, they

LETTERS

equate the teachings of human-
ism with science. I remind him
that the textbooks in question
_taught~students that morals were
subjective, that they should be
created by the students them-

-selves and that students should

avoid overly strict morals that
would make them uncomfortable
or unpopular.

By no stretch of the imagina-
tion can these statements be con-
strued as science. They are
clearly highly debatable, partisan
moral precepts that have no place
in a tax-s'upport"ed public school.
Teachings about the nature of
morals, the proper basis for
morality and the strictness of
moral codes belong in the home
and the religious institutions.

Hot I times

As I sit in Econ 110 class in the
Chemistry Building, whithering
away, the temperatures outside
are well above normal, up into
the 60s‘ and 70s as they have
been for the past several days.
Students are out on the lawns of
the Cathedral and Soldiers and
Sailors Hall like they were
beaches during the spring break
at Daytona, F|a,, but the univer-
sity fails to realize this. On the
other hand, the university fails to
realize when the temperatures
drop into the 20s and 305. This
refers to the ridiculous tempera-
tures which exist in the Chemis-
try Building, Forbes Quad and
other buildings throughout the
year. During the cold winter
months, the university seems to
enjoy freezing the students by
running the NC in some of the
buildings. Likewise, when the

This is not only camouflage, but
it is also the worst tact of all. By’
trying to rule with the threat of
punishment, rather than reasona-

ble efforts at reform, they are rein-

forcing the tactics of the bully.

The outcome is danger caused ‘by

ignorance and fear.

When gutted of its pretenses,
the overall standard set by the
public school system is one of
denial and negligence. The ad-
ministration keeps its problems in
the closet by telling them to

”Shut up, shut up.” The main _

force behind all this is dishonesty
and silence, reinforced by fear.
This is a silence which is
demanded by the bully of his vic-
tims, as well. Fear is the power
which forces this silence. This is
a silence which begins to yell in

the subconscious of those deter- _

comfortable and nearly impossi-

strange one in this aspect). After
four years of going to college
here, I would think that the
university would finally realize

THE PITTNEWS, Wednesday, March 25, I987

On beginning an ending

I go through this every year. I
should be used to it by now.
Whenever it gets close to gradu-
ation time, those of us who are
going to stick around have to start
making plans for next year.

You may have read in these
pages a few days ago that John
Enright has announced his
editorial staff for the 198 7-88 aca-
demic year. No doubt most other
campus organizations are similar-
ly preparing for '87-'88, electing

"new officers, making new plans.

It's a very optimistic time, when
we all tell ourselves, "This is go-
ing to be the best year yet!”

But into all the excitement and
optimism of this annual renais-
sance, a little trepidation must
fall.

For those of us who are left to
carry on the legacy of our gradu-
ating friends, certain doubts in-
trude upon the impending

transition like moths gnawing‘

away at our "best year yet”
bannen

Personally, I've been fighting
the desire to scream at the top of
my lungs, "But I don't want
everything to change!"

Of course, I don't mean that. I
do want things to change, to con-
tinue, to improve. People move
on, and others move in to take
their place. Throughout the
university, students are moving
into positions of added responsi-
bility within their respective or-
ganizations.

But challenges, while exhilarat-

ing, are frightening, and I think .

it's necessary to address that fear.

    

TERES
CANDO

What we're feeling is basically
stage fright. Any experienced per-
former will tell you, you can't
perform without it. It keeps you
alert and pushes you to perform
better.

When you take over a task
from someone else, there's al-
ways the possibility you won't do
it as well, that people willdismiss
what you're doing with "It'll
never be the same."

There's the possibility that
others will view you the way they
now view Saturday Night Live.
Whenever anyone watches ‘it
now, it's compared to the"'g|ory
days" of the original cast. Will
anyone ever do "Weekend Up-
date” the way Chevy Chase did
it?

Will the "glory days" of our
own projects end when we take
over?

My anxieties and insecurities
usually pass momentarily,'yie|d-
ing to what I think is a healthy

confidence. Of course "it’s never
going to be the same," but that
doesn't mean it's going to be
worse. ‘

Who among us is not reluctant
to relinquish the surety of the mo-
ment to embrace the uncertainty
of the future?

When a thought like that enters
my mind, I find a second later
that I want to slap myself in the
face; complacency lurks like a gi-
ant Venus’s-flytrap plant, ready to
grab hold the second our guard
is let down.

My fear of complacency out-
weighs my fear of the future, so
onward I go.

Remember, in high school,
when you cleaned out your lock-
er at the end of senior year? What
a melancholic moment that was.
Personally, it affected me more
than commencement. All the
cutesy notes and pictures hang-
ing up in there, the proverbial
month-old gym socks. No matter
who took over the locker after
you left, it would just never be
the same old locker.

I don't think you can ever out-
grow the cleaning—out—your—
locker syndrome. But the truth is,
if you went back and visited your
old locker, the kid who has it
now is probably a lot more im-
aginative than you ever were.
Though you probably wouldn't

- see it that way.

What we need is to go on be-
lieving that the "glory days" are
yet to come. ‘

Good friends can be selfish

If you have a..friend,'your life

may not be as hopeless as you »

think. . .

When we're confused, frustrat-
ed, scared or desperate,’we look
for a friend. This friend allows
him or herself to be subjected to
our intricate, illogical and un-
predictable behavior and
thoughts. .

You can fail out of school, lose,
your money, sleep on the side-

(walk or go insane, but your friend -

won't desert you. -

Why? What makes people
friends? -It's not their looks,
money or background. Hopeful-
ly, it's more significant than that.
Friendship aides in our survival
from the mental anguish of being
human beings.

Being a friend can give you
personal growth and support but,
most importantly, it gives you the
comforting knowledge. that
you're not the only one who can
be miserable.

I'm not saying friendship isn't’

a genuine relationship of helping
one another. However, in the
midst of one friend trying to help
another, the fact of the matter is,

' one has the problem, the other

doesn't. Therefore, the other is

safe and more secure. It's like —
, watching a good horror movie.

You don't. want to see your
favorite characters get hacked to
bits, but you're relieved that it's
happening to them, not you. One
simply appreciates life more
when another is miserable.

Friendship works somewhat the
__ _same_way., "'

  

 

MARC
  DIICI-IIN

Let's face it, we become friends ‘

not for others, but for ourselves.
Countless times we impulsively
act or fall into depression without
knowing why. "Spilling our guts”
to a friend usually helps to clear
our heads. No one can judge us
more harshly than ourselves. But
without a friend, who will tell us
that we're not all that bad?
Our desire to help is tied to our
nature. When we are faced with
any situation, we usually choose
the position giving us the most
satisfaction. In a friendship, that
position is one of helping the
other person. It is for our own.
fullfillment, or perhaps pleasure,
that we" choose to help.
Happily, in our society, with its
present moral standards, such a
path isnot only accepted, it is
celebrated. 4 ’
For us to survive as asa civi-

V lized society, we must under-

stand that healthy friendships are

the building blocks to peace. -

Peace of mind, and peace in our
less than perfect society. V

We can't classify friendship ac-
cording to social activities, such
as getting blitzed with "the gang”
on Saturday night, playing foot-
ball or double dating. These.
things can be done with
strangers, and one can still have
a good time. '

Your family loves you no mat-
ter what kind of a loser you are.
Friends feel no family obligations.
They accept you as long as you
accept them.

Most friends give and take. In
other words, they give so they
can take. It sounds realistic. AA
friendship is destroyed when no
one wants to give anymore.

We constantly make new
friends and lose old ones — it's
natural. But every friend serves a
purpose. As we grow old, we
think about past friends and
wonder where they are. We
remember them as the "good old
days," but we’ are unaware of
how they changed us and what
we've gained.

Where are those rare friends
who don't live by the age old
emotional contract? They're hard
to find. But if all else fails, buy a
dog. All you have to give is a can
of Alpo, some water and a pat on
the head, and your dog will be
your loyal friend for life, even
though you are only human.

He recalls a man

he couldn't know

Tony Adduci, 9, wrote a
story for his fourth-grade
class at Forest Glen Elemen-
atry School in Glen Ellyn,
Ill. The children in the class
had been assigned to write
about anything they
wanted. -

Tony Adduci's story was
titled "A Brave and Kind
Man." Here it is:

"This story is about a
good man who died too
young.

""John Adduci was born
on Nov. 28, 1947. John
grew up in Downers
Grove, Ill. He had a brother and a sister named Tony and Cathy.
He had a mom and dad named Isabelle and Joe. His dad died
when John was 7. .

"John’s favorite thing was baseball. He was on many cham-
pion teams. He loved the Chicago Cubs, too. .

"John's school years were great. He was very smart. In col-
lege, John had very bad trouble with his grades. He was draft-

ed by the Army. There was a terrible war going on in Vietnam. V

The Army needed young men.because many of the soldiers
were dying. '

"John was trained in California. He received an award for
good rifle aiming. .

"Then he was taken to Vietnam for one yearTEvery‘night, _

John and the other soldiers would go into the jungle and search
for the enemy. That was called a search-and-destroy mission.

Back at home, his mom was very worried. John wrote a letter '
saying,.al| hehad to do was guard a building. He lied to her i

so she wouldn't worry.
"John was wounded twice. He received two purple hearts

for heroism. But he never told his family about this. He didn't _

want them to worry. Every day he would see his friends die.
"John saw lots of sad things in Vietnam. For example, an

8-year-old orphan girl did his laundry and his friends laundry"

to survive. He asked his mom if she could send a doll for the

girl. While John was travelling with Army troops from one base I
to another‘, the roads were lined with orphan children beggingxw

F for food. John threw them candy from the back of the truck.
"John’s last assignment was to be the machine gunner in a
half-track truck. The three men who had been there before him-

were killed. John was killed there also on Nov. 24, 1969, four
days before his 22nd birthday and four weeks before he was
to go home. .
"John was buried with military honors beside his father.
"|'ve heard that a person never really dies if he is remem-
bered with love in someone’s heart. I never met John. But I think

about him a lot, and I think he was a brave and kind man. Even C" V
though he is with God, I can imagine what he would be like ‘

because everyone says he was just like my dad — his twin
brother. I
"I miss you, Uncle John."

I spoke to Tony's mother, Lynne Adduci. She said that writ- ‘ 
. ing the story was Tony's idea; she helped him by getting out . '

a big box of letters that John Adduci had ‘sent home during the

war. She and Tony went through the letters together, and they - ' ii  ll
discussed what had happened-to the uncle that Tony never _

knew. -

"Then Tony went off to write his story," Mrs. Adduci said. V

"He wrote it over and over. I think he rewrote it five times.
"John was killed in 1969, and Tony wasn't born until 1977.

But he is almost obsessed with the uncle he lost in Vietnam. . '

I cried when I read the story the first time. .
''I knew that Tony knew that the war had killed his uncle.

He knows that I won't even allow toy- guns in our house. He . ‘

knows that the death of his Uncle John is the reason why.

"When the children in school heard the story, they didn't
know what to expect. They are so used to television‘ shows, " , ,_
where there is always a happy ending. I think they were ex-  » ’ ' 
pecting Tony's Uncle John to come back and get medals and i

live happily ever after."
I spoke with Tony.

"I decided to write the story because my uncle was a very 

special man to me," he said. "My mom and dad have told me
about him a lot."

Tony said that the Vietnam War was "a long time ago —— part ’ 

of history." Buthe said that "all the kids in school know about
Vietnam. They all know that it was a -terrible thing."-

Tony said even though he never met his uncle, '’I think about
him a lot. I try to figure out what he was like. It's easy for me
to imagine because we have pictures of him, and he sort of looks
like me."

Sometimes, Tony said, he thinks about what it would be like
if his UncleJohn had come back from Vietnam alive and ifthe
two of them'could spend time together now.

"I think it would be fun," Tony said. "He was real good at
baseball..I think that'we would probably play baseball a lot."

They're back. Those sun—seeking, bikini-clad stu-
dents have returned to the shores of Fifth Avenue in
search of the one of the most respected physical
qualities of our time — the tan. —

It isn't quite April yet, and to think it would stay
in the 80s for any extended period of time right
now would make the sun god giggle. But it did
reach the 70s yesterday, thereby causing a great stir
in dorm room closets as beach towels everywhere
were snapped into duty on the lawn of Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall. '

It is interesting to think that when architects
designed the hall, they were probably thinking of
the lawn’s gentle slope down from the grandeur of
the building as beneficial to the beauty of the A
place. ' —

‘As the finished product stood before them in all
its wonder earlier this century, their sighs of con-
tentment were no doubt interrupted by the excited
shrieks of students in the background.

”Man, what a great place to get a tan! That lawn
is sloped almost perfectly toward the sun! Aaah!
Where is my |otion?!” _

The designers would walk away in bitter disgust.

T‘ Oh well.

As of yesterday, the lawn was filled again. Its al-
lure as a tanning mecca has remained —- not to

mention the fact that it is a much shorter walk than _

Park. There are a lot of Carnegie Mellon University
students over that way, and the boredom of reading
the poetry of Keats just isn't the same as a good,
trashy beach book by Judith Krantz.

It is the closest thing we get to spring break, and
it serves us quite well. There is something relaxing

about doing nothing more than sitting and squinting

a little bit as the glare of the sun bounces off the
pages, yellowing them in a cool sort of way.

Next year, when the official spring break is in-
stituted, it will be interesting to see what happens
on the lawn in early spring’. Those who are con-
cerned ehough with their bodies to sit out in 70
degree sunshine for the shot at a tan will no doubt
head for beaches in the warmer southern climates.

There are some people I know who can't wait for
the sun, no matter where it is. These folks will
head for tanning salons at the first sight of pale skin
on their person. I '

makes them feel better about themselves, and that's
always a good thing. A '

It's just that it's hard to look at someone with a
straight face knowing they've just spent 20 minutes
laying in this thing that closes around them like a
coffin. They lay on these glowing blue tubes that
emit enough infrared rays to toast them to a golden
brown and give them a better shot at acquiring
melanoma.

The word ”melanoma” is innocent enough. It
sounds like something one gets as part of a tran-
scendental state. '

”How was your meditation session today, Edith?”

”Oh, it was wonderful. I think I reached a state
of melanoma."

Unfortunately, what it really is is a form of skin
cancen

As far as I know, nothing that man creates is less
damaging to us than what nature has already given
us. Laying in the sun — while it feels good — in-
creases your chances of skin cancer.

Laying in a tube-lined box that looks like a coffin
cannot be much healthier.

So, welcome back. The threat of skin cancer
never stopped anyone from tanning before, so why
start now? I think the lawn looks better anyway, ar-
chitects be damned. Besides, it helps me forget
there are cannons pointed at me as I type here in

Newest trends in social work I

are featured at conference

By Brendan Walsh

' For The Pitt News

The undergraduate School of
Social Work sponsored its 15th
Bachelor of Arts Social Work
Spring Conference Tuesday at the
William Pitt Union.

The conference was held in ob-

servance of Social Work Month, .

the school's 50th Jubilee and
Pitt's Bicenentennial.

According to Mattie B. Addis,
Director of the BASW program,
the conference is geared towards‘
the interdisciplinary approach of
”issues, dialogue and new skills
that adhere to the needs of the
community.”

Field representatives from le-
gal, medical and leglislative or-

ganizations delivered lectures to
inform those in attendance of the
relational importance of social
work within the different fields of
work.

”Social workers are experts in
the boundary work,” Addis said.
’’In a sense, we bring systems
together.”

The conference was comprised
of various workshops designed
for those involved with social
work. Numerous representatives
from different counseling groups
and services were present for the
conference.

”People don't realize how
much we are tied in with other
professions,” said Julie Garcia,
BASW coordinating committee
member.

Another committee member,
Amy Cornell, agreed. ”There are
a lot of things people don't think
they [social workers] would be in-
volved in.”

The significance of the confer-
ence was that it enabled the
different professions to interact
and learn of the issues and of the
skills needed in everyday situ-
ations. -

”There’s an emphasis on what
role and function a social worker
plays on the team,” said Addis.

Often, social workers and other
professionals use similar ap-
proaches and techinques in han-
dling cases ”yet overlap into
distinct different boundary
works,” Addis said. ”But,
together we serve.”

Activists campaign for
LaRouche on local sidewalks

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
campus and surrounding areas
have always been a logical target
for activists. Now that the temper-
atures are rising, more and more
are setting up shop on Oakland
sidewalks. Thousands of students
are concentrated in a relatively
small area, and all of them must
walk somewhere, at some time.

Some of the most visible at-
tivists include the supporters of

referred to as ”Larouchies.”

on Atwood Street yesterday.

soliciting passersby.

One activist, who declined to
give his name, asked a woman,’

By Laurie Lehosky

For The Pitt News

In an effort tostimulate pub-
lic awareness of the dangers of
environmental pollution V in
Pennsylvania,the Clean Water
Organization held its second
annual" Clean Water Cam-
paign on Monday night in
Forbes Quad.

The program consisted of

ous water pollution topics.
David Hastings, program
director of Pittsburgh Clean
Water Regional, spoke on sav-
ing Lake Arthur located in
Butler County's Moraine State
Park; A

According to Hastings, acid
mine drainage has been iden-

four speakers discussing vari-

tified by the Department of En-
vironmental Resources as the

. major source of water pollu-

tion in the state. .

”-A million and ahalf people
from across the nation visit the
park each year. It would be

' ruined as a lake and as "a

residential area,’ he said.

According to Hastings, thou-
sands of petitions were sent in
to the DER from concerned
citizens. The DER released $1
million to reclaim numerous
surface mines that were harm-
ing the ecosystem of Moraine
State Park.

Dr. Edgar Berkey of the
Center for Hazardous Materi-
als Research spoke on drink-
ing water in the area and acid
materials.

Clean water a local issue

”We need to find less toxic .
ways to produce things in our
society,” Berkey said.

David Zwick, co-author of
the book Clean Water Action,
spoke on the organization and
enforcing laws to control pol-

. lution.

Closing the program, Dr. Jan
Sykora, Pitt's School of Public
Health, spoke on giardiasis.
According to Sykora, giardia-

sis is an organism that grows

as a cyst. ’Anima|s such as
beavers and cattle carry the
cyst. After rainfall, the cysts are
carried in sewage into the
rivers, streams and ground
water. Humans can get the dis-
ease if the cysts are present in
the drinking water.

PTL takeover begun by Swaggart

A By Jerry Schwartz I

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — TV‘ evangelist
Jim Bakker’s lawyer accused rival
preacher Jimmy Swaggart on
Tuesday of masterminding a bid
to take over Bakker’s $172 mi_l—
lion PTL empire.

”Last night Jim Swaggart came
out of his cave or the high grass
or wherever he was hiding and
identified himself to The

Charlotte Observer as the man «
that Roy Grutman had in his

mind,” Bakker’s lawyer, Norman
Roy Grutman, said at a news con-
ference in New York.

”Now that Jimmy Swaggart
identified himself, I will not deny
Jim Swaggart-was that man,” he
said.

When Bakker stepped down as
head of the 500,000-member PTL
ministry lastweek, he accused a
rival of seeking to usurp the or-
ganization by exposing the fact
that Bakker had an extramarital
encounter seven years ago and
paid blackmail to cover -it up,"

Swaggart, president of Jimmy
Swaggart Ministries in Baton
Rouge, Lag, was in Los Angeles

preparing’ for a crusade this

weekend and was not immedi-
ately available to comment on
Grutman’s latest accusations.

But in an interview with The
Charlotte Observer published
Tuesday he had said, ’’I’m total-
ly aghast because nothing like
that has ever been considered,
thought of or remotely engaged
in."

Swaggart, who has feuded in
the past with Bakker, denied any
attempt to take over the PTL.
”That would be the last thing in
the world I would ever want,” he
said. -

Both Swaggart and Bakker are
ministers of the 2 million-
member Assemblies of God,
based in Springfield, Mo., andthe
country's largest Pentecostal
denomination.

Grutman said at the news con-
ference that Swaggart had gone to
leaders of the Assemblies of God
on several occasions beginning

last summer, ”seeking some sort-

of sanctions” against Bakker.

’’In the course of time that I've
been dealing with this matter I
have seen. unmistakable evidence
that beyond simply going to the
Assembly of God, there was
clearcut evidence that Jimmy
Swaggart was attempting to or-
chestrate the ouster of Jim Bak-
ker,” Grutman said.

"Jerald Ogg, Swaggart’s attor-
ney, said before Grutman’s news
conference, that lawyers were
looking closely at some state-

ments made by Grutman on tel-
evision.

’’I assure you we're going to
look at taking action,” Ogg said
in Baton Rouge, La. ”You can
defame somebody without iden-
tifying them if it's clear who
you're talking about.”

a ”When people start question-
ing a minister's integrity that's just
a classy way of robbing and steal-
ing. We just can't-stand for that,”
Ogg said. ”|t’s no secret thatJim-
my doesn’t see things the way
they do, but this is'ridiculous.”

In another development, Jessi-
ca Hahn, a 27-year-old secretary
in Long Island, N.Y., confirmed
she had a sexual liaison with Bak-
ker in .1980 but denied that she
blackmailed him, according to a
report Tuesday in New York
Newsday. » , A

Hahn, who said she had spent
most of her adult life working for
the Massapequa Tabernacle
Church, said she later received ”a
few dollars” of the $1 15,000 that
PTL officials reportedly paid after

«she complained to them about

the incident, the paper reported.
A traveling evangelist, John
Wesley. Fletcher, who came to

_Massapequa occasionally‘ in the
1970s, setup the Dec. 6, 1980,

encounter between Hahn and
Bakker in a hotel room in Clear-
water Beach, Fla., Newsday said.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Ron-
nie DeSillers, the 7-year-old
Florida boy whose liver

. problems wbn President Rea-
gan’s attention, remained in
critical but stable condition
Tuesday as doctors continued
their ”urgent” search for a se-
cond donor liver. '

The Miami boy was report-
ed in the intensive care unit of
Children's Hospitalof Pitts-
burgh, where he received his
first new liver in a 12-hour.
operation Feb. 24.

Ronnie's condition was
downgraded from serious to
critical during the weekend

DeSillers’ condition is worsening  

when doctors said a virus,
called cytomegalovirus‘, at-
tacked his new liver. The boy
has been running a tempera-

-ture since last week.

‘Doctors said it is likely the
virus will damage the liver,
and a second transplant is
needed.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 25, I987

By Brandon Bentz
For The Pitt News

With the formation of the Pitts-

burgh Cancer Institute, cancer pa- —

tients in western Pennsylvania
may gain a new outlook on life.

”We are creating a new
specialty care unit [that] is a cross
between critical care, oncology
specialization and research,” said
Margaret (Marc) Irwin, R.N., clin-
ical director of Protocol Services
for the Cancer Institute.

Since July 1986, the clinic has

' offered outpatient’ clinical care

designed for the experimental ap-
plication of new cancer treat-

ments on people showing
advanced stages of the disease.

The institute also serves as an
information resource center for
western Pennsylvania area
groups actively involved in
cancer research.

Dr. Daniel Vlock, oncologist at
the Veterans Administration
Hospital, said, ”The Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute is sort of an um-
brella organization for a variety of

hospitals in. the area.”

Affiliates of the institute include
Magee-Womens, Montefiore,
Presbyterian—University, Chil-
drens, Eye and Ear and Veterans
Administration hospitals.

He added, ”We still have a lot
of groups out there that are pret-
ty much doing their own thing.
We're getting to a point where a
lot of that is being centralized
through us, through information
sharing.

”We feel we can offer a serv-
ice to the communities of western
Pennsylvania,” said Vlock. ”Phy—
sicians in outlying hospitals,
although not necessarily full-time
members of the Cancer Institute,
should have the ability to take ad-
vantage of what we are studying,
both in terms of their understand-
ing of what's‘ going on and in
terms of offering newer therapies
[that] may be-beneficial."

The institute will open an out-

patient clinic in Falk Clinic this.

month. Intensive one—day thera-
py, which will utilize experimen-
tal treatments, will be offered at
the clinic.

Within the institute’s affiliation
network, research groups! are
constantly looking at the various
aspects designed for the treat-
ment of cancer. »

”I think we are looking at this
[the treatments] on a variety of
kinds of levels, both in clinical
studies and in the laboratory as
well,” said Vlock.

One major point of scrutiny for
the institute is the immune sys-

9

Cancer Institute creating speciality care unit

tem’s ability to fight off cancer
cells and how this ability can be
clinically manipulated.

The broad category of agents or '

therapies, which can help the
host fight his cancer, is called Bi-
ological Response Modifiers.
Treatments that fall into this
category include compounds
such as Interferon, Interleukin—2
and Tumor Necrosis Factor.
”The most logical place to use
biologicals will be when the dis-
ease burden is small. Will it
replace chemotherapy? No, I
don't think so. Itwill in the future

be used in combination with _ ’

chemotherapies, more than like-
ly,” said Vlock.

Pregnant women urged to undergo test for AIDS

By Jerry Estill

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Any wom-
an who wants to have a baby
shouldbe tested for AIDS before
becoming pregnant,’ Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop said
Tuesday. . -

Koop’s advice came during a
question-and-answer period at
the National Press Club in which
he was asked about mandatory
AIDS-testing for people applying
for marriage licenses.

   

Othrs -

  

 

   

”I can't understand why it is so

controversial,” he said. ’’I would

think anybody who is getting
married today would want to be
tested and would want to know
whether his or her intended
spouse had the AIDS virus.
”One of the things I think is
most important about this  is
my great concern for the babies
who are born to  positive
mothers,” he said. ’’I think no
woman should contemplate a
pregnancy without voluntarily
wanting to be tested for the AIDS

Researchers say there is about
a 90 percent chance that a wom-
an infected with the virus will
pass it on to her newborn child.
It is not clear what percentage of

people with the virus ultimately

develop the disease itself.

Koop, a strong opponent of -

abortion, answered cautiously
when asked whether abortion is
an option for a woman who dis-
covers she has the AIDS virus af-
ter becoming pregnant.

”If you wanted to give her all

  
    
   
     
 

    
  

 

    
     
     
     
   

the possibilities that were availa-
ble to her, you would have to
mention abortion,” he said.

’’I can tell you what the prac-
tice is around the country at the
moment, anecdotal|y,” Koop
continued.

”These things are not reported
scientifically yet, but they will -be.
It is my understanding that in
major obstetrical clinics on the
East Coast, where the population

has a high incidence of the AIDS «

virus, that women who are preg-
nant under 13 weeks are being
advised to have abortions. And

about 50 percent of those, I un— '

derstand, "are -indeed having
abortions.” ,

Koop said he thinks the gener-
al resistance to AIDS testing for

marriage applicants is ”a han— '

gover from the old days of syphi-

lis” when a person with syphilis ’

could not obtain a license unless
undergoing treatment.

”But in those days our culture' T
was quite different,” he said. ”If'

NEW YORK —— Alexander M.
Haig Jr. entered elective politics
Tuesday with a bid for the
presidency, refusing to rule out a

‘tax increase and warning against

”arms control for arms controI’s
sake.” _
Declaring his candidacy for the

' 1988 Republican presidential

nomination at a news conference
in the Waldorf—Astoria Hotel,
Haig emphasized his experience
as a former secretary of state,
NATO commanding general and
White House chief of staff.

But he conceded he is a long-
shot in the political battle to suc-
ceed his former boss, Ronald
Reagan. '

Marlin Fitzwater, Reagan's
chief spokesman, reiterated that

”the president is neutral in the

primary contests for the Republi-

can nomination for president and
welcomes all candidates as being
healthy and constructive for the
party.” I

Haig and former Gov. Pete du
Pont of Delaware are declared
candidates for the GOP presiden-
tial nomination. Rep. Jack Kemp
of New York plans to join_ them
April 6.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday March 25, 1987

Also considered certain to
enter the race are Dole, Vice
President George Bush, the Rev.
Pat Robertson and former
Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld.

Following his announcement,
Haig flew to New Hampshire to
campaign in the state that will
hold the first presidential primary
next year.

The former guard was trans-
ferred from the Marine base at
Twentynine Palms, Calif.,. to
Quantico,—Va., Tuesday night and
will be held in confinement
pending an appearance before a
military magistrate.

Lt. Col. John Shotwell, a Ma-
rine spokesman, identified the
man as Arnold Bracy of Wood-
side Queens, New—York City, a
21-year-old corporal ”whose tour
of duty overlapped Sgt.
Lonetree’s at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow,”

Shotwell had said earlier Tues-
day the Marine Corps would not

release the man's identity before ’

Wednesday because it wanted to
make sure his next-of-kin had
been notified of his arrest and
transfer. The spokesman subse-
quently agreed to release the
man's name. 1

Bracy ”has been apprehended
for possible involvement in
espionage—re|ated activities [as a
result of] the continuing investi-
gation of the Lonetree case by the
Naval Investigative Service,”
Shotwell added.

Haigannounces presidential candidacy

gan’s first secretary of state was
marked by clashes between the
strong—willed retired general and
White House aides.

He made leadership the theme
of his campaign but offered few
specifics of how he would deal
with national problems or where
he would differ with‘ the Reagan
policies.

He cited the federal budget
deficit as the biggest domestic
problem and, when pressed on
whether he would rule out a tax
increase to help lower it, replied:

”No, I would not rule out a tax
increase. I would rule out going
immediately to a tax increase so
that the heavy—spending ways of
the Congress — the Democrati-
cally controlled Congress now —
can continue.”

Haig continually tried to walk
a narrow line between ‘criticism
of policies pursued by the Reagan
administration and praise for the
president.

Asked to cite. areas where he
would depart from Reagan poli-
cies, Haig said, ”I would seek a
number of changes. Here at
home, above all, fiscal responsi-

bility.”

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 25, I987

What me worry? I don’t care who gets elected

\.U

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, the time
has come for the presidential can-
didates to come out of the wood-
work with some fancy footwork,
fighting for the chance to clean
up_after Ronald the Forgetfull.

Look, over there, who do we
have? Why, it's George Bush.

‘ And a fine man he is.

_As you may remember, Bush
was Reagan's vice president
(president of vice? It's a thought.)
in a time when the twoworked
together. His chances, if they
should even be called that, are
minimal at best.

Let's face it. The guy took an in-
credible kick in the face at the
end of the president's last
press(ing) conference. He may be
hard-pressed to deal with the
pressure he now finds himself
unden

Bush is fast, he's chic, he's '80s,
but he's also a jerk. If you hap-
pened to catch him on 60
minutes, telling the world what a
great guy he is, and how he once
saved the whole world in some
war, you’ll understand what I
mean. If you didn't happen to

catch him, I

envy you.
Desperately.

N—e—e—e—xt. Alexander ”I’ve just
got to get back into politics”
Haig. Can you believe that? The
guy couldn't deal with the posi-
tion of secretary of state, and now
he wants to run the whole show.
I guess it couldn't get much
worse than the present presiden-
tial mess, and a good man is, ad-
mittedly, hard to find. Maybe a
hard man is good to find. Maybe,
just maybe, Haig would hardly

be a good man to find in the

White House.

Really, what has he done?
What have any of them done?

More than I have, it's true, but
I didn't ask to ride this herd of
American bull.

Haig, come on, you remember
him, that wonderful chief of the
staff infection under Nixon. Nix-
on? I am not a crook. Remember?
A fool maybe, but not a crook.
Does that sound at all familiar,
even a little bit?- Does that sound
like Reagan? I knew that selling
arms to our enemies was wrong,
but I really had good intentions.

COMMENTARY
MATTHEW THORNTON

 
The most powerful position in the
world, and the guy has good in-
tentions. Lovely.

So who else is out there in the
pre—presidential stew?

How could I forget. There's Pat

minute.

What does old Rat baby want
more than anything else? He
wants to spread the word of his
god. He's a preacher, that's what
preachers do. Now, through the
ages, preachers have always
wanted to find a way to spread
the word a little further, a little
thinner. ’

Pat's got a great idea. Get a job

themselves.”

Family situations also play a
role, especially single-parent
homes or economically hard hit
families in which the head of the
household is unemployed. These
situations place more responsibil-
ity on the teen.

”Dealing with teens is different
than dealing with adults,” ex-
plained Coleman. ”Teens see
everything in black and white;
they don't have experiences that
permit them to have a vision of
the future. They think there are
noother alternatives. That is why
having someone to talk to is so
important.” .

One of the key services provid
ed by the 24-hour program is

-listening. ”Listening to a teen is

very important,” said Coleman.
”Today, parents [especially single
parents] are not as available and
have less opportunity to commu-
nicate with their children.
Child/parent communication is

highly significant" in the teen

years.” v

Coleman suggests that parents
make time for their children and
keep the lines of communication
open. She also advises troubled
teens to find someone to talk to
— whether it be a relative, friend
or teacher. ”Sometimes talking
about a particular problem with

. someone who is sympathetic to
the situation can release some of ’

the underlying tension.”

Jacques said several of the pa-

long after the treatment. On CAT

there is often no sign of their

However, this does not mean
they are cured.

”One young man recurred
over two years later, when I
thought he was over the hump,”

Jacques said.

Of the 60 patients treated, 16
have died. He said everyone else
is alive and well with follow—up
times ranging from a week to 26
months.

Typically people with gliomas
live just "under a year from the
time their disease is first spotted.
And they survive 14 weeks from
the time of recurrence of their dis-

Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., direc-
tor of the National Cancer Insti-

Bonesso said he doesn't think
it is the responsibility of Oakland
merchants to provide their own
protection from the gangs.

”There are a lot of things that
we can do, but I don't thing it's
our position to take these matters
into our own hands,” he said. ’’If
they don't beef up security, espe-
cially on the weekends, this is go-

Police officials would not say
whether plainclothes patrolmen

THE ‘PITT NEWS

High recommen

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

. When Pitt offensive line coach‘

Mike Solari resigned in January to
go to the Dallas Cowboys, it
seemed as if yet another un-
needed thorn was put into Mike
Gottfried’s side. . I

A great recruiting class, sure,
but with ‘no one to coach the
offense, they wouldn’t be going
very far. I

_But now, with the hiring of Bill
Meyers, Gottfried has found his
Androcles to remove the thorn.

”In four weeks, we interviewed
15 people for the job,” said Gott-
fried. ”What we found in Bill
Meyers is basically what we've
been looking for all along."

Meyers’ most recent job was at
the University of Missouri, where
‘he was the assistant head coach ‘
and offensive coordinator under
former Pittsburgh Steeler assistant,
Woody Widenhofer. He said he '
comes to Pitt enthusiastic and
conﬁdent

’’I think I'll really be able to do
something with this already su-.
perb program,” said Meyers.
”I’ve gota lot of experience else-
where, and that, I hope, will
prove to be a major asset to our
plans."

One aspect of this is that Mey-
ers is not really a newcomer to
Pittsburgh. He spent one previous
season here as the offensive line
coach for Chuck Noll and the
Pittsburgh Steelers in .1984.

”|,’m really glad to get back
here to Pittsburgh because I real-

ly think it is a great American
town,” said Meyers. ”I have had
a lot of good times here that
mixed well with a lot ofhard
work, and that really can give you
a good feeling about a place. Be-
sides, Pittsburgh really likes its
football, and that part I really
like.” .

But Meyers’ football history just
doesn't start with Pittsburgh. In
1982 and 1983 he was the line
coach for the Green Bay Packers _
under Coach Forrest Gregg, from
1979 through 1981 for Notre
Dame and from 1977 through
1978 for California. .

”We received several high
recommendations for Bill,” said
Gottfried. “Many of them came
from former football stars such as
Bart Starr and Dan Devine, as
well as Chuck Noll. I think wefve
made a very good choice.”

The Panther offense has a repu-
tation of being a member of su-
perior ranks in college football.
Although during the past few sea-
sons this may not have been the
case, Meyers sincerely hopes he
can bring back this status to Gott-
fried’s ailing squad.

‘'1 do have my own p|ans,,but
what I've got to do is fit them _into
the framework of Coach Gott-
fried’s already superior formu-
las,” said Meyers. ”We hope to
keep things basically as they are,
but'with a few subtle changes.
Pitt has a traditionally great
ground game, and this isn't going

- to change much. The thing we're,

really going to try and improve
upon is the idea of punch and

Pittsburgh may see new football franchise J

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— Warm-
/ weather football may make a
comeback in Pittsburgh this year
with a,new idea in professional

. sports — arena football.

The Arena Football League,
which also plans franchises in
Denver, Chicago and Washing-
ton, D.C., will play up to three
games in Pittsburgh's Civic ‘Arena
in June and July, according to
league President Jim Foster.

”We’ve -made the decision,
basically, to go to Pittsburgh,”
Foster said. ”For all practical pur-
poses, we're there.” 7

Foster said the first season will

be a ”preview” for a hoped-for
expansion to eight or. 10 teams in
1988.

Arena football is to beplayed ‘

indoors on a 50-yard field, rough-
ly half the area of a normal foot-
ball field. Each side is to have
eight players, and all but the
quarterback play offense -and
defense. There are to be no punts,
and the football on-missed field
goals will bounce off a_net back
into play. '

. Foster said the league will own
 the franchises in the first year and

then sell them in 1988. He said
each team will play six games this

season, and the two teams with
the best records will play a one-
game championship.

Tom_Rooney, assistant general A

manager and marketing chief for
the Civic Arena Corp., said offi-
_cials are picking uniform colors
for the Pittsburgh franchise and
plan a contest to name the team.

Chuck Klausing, former foot-
ball coach at Carnegie Mellon
University and assistant coach] at
the University of Pittsburgh, is a
likely candidate to coach the
Pittsburgh franchise, according to
a published report.

Swimmers make

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swimming
team placed the highest of any
Northeastern team in the NCAA
Championships recently. The
women finished 27th out of 72

. teams.

Four Pitt swimmers qualified as
Honorable Mention All-
Americas.

’Pitt’s "200-yard free relay team,

consisting of seniors Traci Fister

and Sue Hickman,.junio.r Cindy
Rose and freshman Laurie Walc-
zak achieved Honorable Mention
All-America standing when they
tied for 15th place in the prelimi-
nary trials of the NCAA Champi-
onships.

The 200-yard free relay team
entered the preliminaries seated
17th. The 200-yard free relay
team went on to win the conso-
lation finals. V

”I’m very happy with the way

~ we placed at the NCAA Champi-
_ onships,” said Rose. ”I knew we

would accomplish something at
the championships. Even though

we were competing against some
swimmers who had been to the

Olympics, we were not intimidat— '

ed. We knew that if our time
wasn't good enough, that we
wouldn't have qualified for the
NCAA Championships in the first
place.”

According to Pitt women's
swimming coach David Bel-
lowich, this was a tough NCAA
Championship.

”This was the most compete-
tive NCAA Championship meet
I've ever seen,” said Bellowich.
”The times the swimmers had to
meet in order to qualify for the
championships were very fast this
year. The swims at the meet were
simply phenominal. There were
a lot of close races, aswell as
new U.S. and world records es-

Although the qualifying stan-
dards were tough this year, the

the 50-yard freestyle.

”I was very disappointed with

‘the outcome of the 50-yard

freestyle race,” said Hickman.
”What can I say? The race is only
23 seconds long. I'm not sure
what went wrong, only that I had
a bad race.”

Pitt freshman Sandy Albright
also qualified for the NCAA
Championships in an individual
event. Albright placed 24th in the
I00-yard backstroke. A _

”-I wasn't extremely pleased
with the way I swam at the NCAA
Championships,” said Albright.
”I know I could have finished
better if I hadn't gotten so over-
whelmed by the competition._I
feel that the exposure I gained

-from the meet this year will make
me more comfortable and give
me more confidence next year.”

Pitt's medley relay team, com— -

prised of Albright, senior Jodi
O'Neil, Walczak and Hickman,
finished 27th. .
”It is a good feeling to see"thé
swimmers I coach come through

under pressure," said Belowich. -

”It is great to see an athlete think
that they can do something. It is
even greater to see that athlete ac-
tually go out and do it.

”The pressure the athletes face
at the NCAA Championships is a
subtle pressure,” continued Be-

’ lowich. ”The pressure is different
’ from that they face at the Olym-
pic trials because at the NCAA .

Championships they are also
swimming for their team.”

Stottlemyer. ”He is a fifth-year
senior, and this was his first time
at the NCAAs. He worked hard
and wrestled his heart out; he just
couldn't pull it out.”

Teammate Bolin faired better at
150-pounds. In the first round, he
defeated Matt Toves of San Jose
State 11-7. Next up was Sean
Finkbiener of Penn State. Bolin
took this match 3-2. But in the
third round, Jeff Jordon of Wis-
consin was able to hold him Off
7-4.

The next match was a big one
for Bolin, as a win would earn
him All—America honors. Unfor-
tunately, he lost to Scott Cook of
Utah State 7-3.

”| feel bad for Gary,” said Stott-
lemyer. ’’I think that the injuries
he suffered at the start of the sea-

son still bothered him a little. It '

just wasn't his tourney.”

Santoro carried the flag for Pitt.
At the 142-division, he finished
second overall, collecting his se-
cond straight All—America honors.

Santoro totally dominated in
his first match, defeating Jim
Sloan of Central Conneticut 19-3
with only five minutes gone in
the match.

He took the next two matches
just as convincingly by defeating
John Parr of Virginia 12-4 and Joe
Hodge of PSU 12-7.

This left Santoro one match
away from the finals. In his path,
though, was the only wrestler to
defeat him this year, Nick Neville
of Oklahoma. It was a hotly con-
tested match, and Santoro was
able to pull it out 8-6.

’’I was excited going into this
match,” said Santoro. ’’It was a
tough one. It really felt great to
win that one.”

Shortstop Jeltz wants to do more with bat

A By Ralph Bernstein

AP Sports Writer

CLEARWATER, Fla. —— Steve
Jeltz has a dream.

”If I hit .280, 15 home runs,
knock in 60 runs, that would be
a year,” he said.

It would be a year like no other
for Jeltz, who makes a living with
his glove at shortstop, not with
his bat, which has left him with
a major-league average of only
.208.

In the minors, the best Jeltz
ever hit was .265 in 71 games at
Portland in 1983.

But the Phillies weren't con-
cerned with Jeltz’s bat when they
took him in the ninth round of the
June 1980 draft. And they're not
now.

All Manager John Felske asks of
the 180-pound shortstop is

defense. Felske has batters who
can produce hits and runs.

Hitters such as Juan Samuel,
Von Hayes, Mike Schmidt, Lance
Parrish, Glenn Wilson and Mike
Easler can carry Jeltz, but the
prospect makes him _grimmace.

Although the 5-11 Jeltz is
aware of Fe|ske’s outlook, he
works daily with hitting coach
Del Unser, who holds out hope.

The first goal, Unser said, is get-
ting Jeltz to stop undercutting the
ball.

”He’s got to put it on the
ground to be successful,” Unser
said as he watched the shortstop
in the batting cage.

Unser noted that Jeltz taught
himself to switch hit last season
and did increase his average from
.189 in 1985 to .219.

”It isn't beyond thinking that
we could get it up another 30 or
40 points this year,” Unser said.

”Just to make contact hitting
left—handed for the first time [last
season] was an accomplishment.
This year, with more concentra-
tion, he'll begin hitting instead of

filling space.”

Expressing the perennial opti-
mism of a hitting coach, Unser
won't buy the popular theory that
bad hitters tend to develop bad
habits that defy any attempt to

break them.

’’I remember when I was with
Washington and Ted Williams
‘ was the manager. He took Eddie
Brinkman, a .210 hitter, and

coached him to a .280 season.

”Brinkman later reverted some-
what, but never as bad,” Unser

said.

Meanwhile, Jeltz hasn't forgot-
ten what made him a major

league shortstop.

He wants to improve on his
22-error performance of 1986. Of

the seven shortstops who played
100 or more games, five made
fewer errors. Among the seven,
Jeltz had the fourth best fielding
percentage.

He hasn't forgotten that last
spring he came within someone
else’s broken bone of spending
the season in Triple A.

Jeltz was ticketed for Portland
in the Pacific Coast League last
March when Phillies shortstop
Tom Foley suffered a broken
wrist. I ‘

Felske handed the job to Jeltz,
and he played so well that Foley
eventually was traded.

Jeltz started in organized ball in
1980 with Spartanburg and has
been nurtured through the Phil-
lies’ system. He started the 1985
season as the Phillies’ regular
shortstop and went through an er-
rorless streak of 46 games cover-
ing 310.1 innings.

awarded the starting center field

Jeltz learned in '85 that success
can be brief. After the streak end-
ed, his fielding fell apart. The next
thing he knew, he was back, in
Portland.

”I can't be satisfied with any-
thing,” he said. ”I don't think in
terms of I have the job. I'm not
close to what I can do. I have a
lot more potential than I've
showed. I'm working hard."

Phillies’ Tekulvegetting better with age A

By Ralph Bernstein
AP Sports Writer

CLEARWATER, Fla. — Kent
Tekulve reached a magic number
for pitchers on March 5. He
turned 40, the age when the first
question asked is one of re-
tirement.

The word isn't yet in Teku|ve’s
vocabulary. He believes he is get-
ting better with age.

”From a pitching standpoint,”
said the veteran Philadelphia
Phillies’ reliever, ”my age is a
wash.” .

Tekulve admits he's not as fast

' as the pitcher who came to the

National League for good with
the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1975.
”Sure, I've lost a mile or two
per hour off my fastball,” he said
at the Phillies’ spring training
camp. ”But while I can't throw as
hard, I know much more about

- what I'm doing. So, onewashes

out the other.

”I throw a higher percentage of '

good pitches. I make fewermis—
takes. Iunderstand more and

more what I’m doing.”

Tekulve said he wonders if he's
not better off depending on con-
trol and knowledge more than
power pitching.

”More often I'm not in the
hole. I stay ahead of the hitters in
the count, don't walk people,” he
said. ”Hey, I might be better off.
I'll take the balance the way it is
now. All I know is that it works.”

It worked last year. He won 1 1
games, second best on the Phil-
lies’ staff. He pitched in 73
games, one under the club
record. .

Tekulve is coming off an ad-
venturesome season. He broke
Roy Face’s NL record July 20 for
games pitchedin relief at 819. He
now has 853. The 170-pound
reliever broke Face’s NL mark for
games pitched at 846 on Sept.
16. .

In his career, Tekulve never has
started a major-league game. He
started only 18 in seven minor-
league seasons. —

Tekulve pitched under some
personal pressure in 1986. He

worked under a contract that
renewed for this season at
$800,000 only if he pitched in 70
games or more. He finished with
73.

Only the New York Mets’
Roger McDowell with 14 had
more victories in relief than
Tekulve, and only McDowell
(128) and Ron Robinson (116) of
Cincinnati pitched more innings.

Tekulve pitched 110 innings,
more than any season since 128
at Pittsburgh in 1982.

He credits the heavier work
load for his comeback last season
after a 4-10 mark in 1985.

”Work is still the key for me,”
said Tekulve as he prepared for
another season of middle relief.

”The more I pitch, the better I
pitch.’’ .

He pointed out that he worked
only 75.2 innings the previous
year, the lowest for him in five

‘years. .

The 6-4 Tekulve still is so slim
that he looks like a strong wind
might blow him away. When he
unwinds with that patented sub-
marine pitch, he could be likened
to a soft pretzel unraveling.

Tekulve at Pittsburgh was one
of the bestshort relievers in the
game. He was given the middle
relief job here after the Phillies
aquired Steve Bedrosian as their
short ”hammer.” ,

”I could still be a short man,”
Tekulve insisted. ”But here the

whole [bullpen] unit works bet-
ter if I'm in the middle.

”The better I do, the better
Steve does. And if he needs a
breather as short man, I can fill
in. It gives us more flexibility.”

Tekulve said the pressure of
middle relief is as great as short
relief.

”You’re under the gun in both.
If the middle guy doesn't get
through the 5th, 6th, 7th or
whatever innings, there is noth-
ing for the short guy to save.

”And the satisfaction is the
same," he added. ”|’ve been on
the other end, which makes the
process easier to understand.
Steve and I, we double team
them.”

Stone  

Continued from page 17

Felske said he's put off talking
with Stone because he doesn't
know what to tell him.

The manager, however, admit-
ted he would try to trade Stone
or send him back to Triple-A if he

had to do something right now.
Stone has read the signs.
”There are too many out-
fielders in this camp,” he noted.
”I hope the scouts are watching.
”If I don't play here I hope it's
somewhere else.”

Stone believes he has matured

I personally aswell as profession-

ally. He doesn’t take things so
hard and serious as he once did.

”I’ve been through a couple of
years, and it's made me
stronger,” he said.

potential with veteran players like
Bill Cherpak, Chris Goetz, Tom
Ricketts, Chip Backauskas and

Dean Caliguire. Add to this some-

of the members of the incoming
recruiting class, and the line
should. prove to be like a
locomotive.

”Next year, we won't have the
label of being a young team any-
more,” said Stepnoski. ”Most of
us have the experience, and it
will definitely be to our ad-
vantage.

”Coach Meyers is bringing in
., different techniques which ‘we

' will be able to use differently

against any of the ‘teams we
play,” he continued. ”Our basic
strategies shouldn't change
much, but just how we're going
to use those strategies will change
week by week.”

”The one thing I've noticed
about his [Meyers’] style already

7 I is that he has a lot more intensi-

so

ty,” said Cherpak. ”What kind of
game ‘we'll be playing will de-
pend upon our quarterback situ-
ation, but it should change for the
better."

”What we've got already is a very
good pass-rush team which needs
a little more technique of its own
to be great. Weneed to find that
balance, and once we find it, we

ake one look at Lee Gutkind,
and it's hard to believe that
he once rode a motorcycle
across America so he could
write-a book called Bike Fever.

With his ever—present sport coat
and necktie and his graying — but
stylish — hair, one would expect him
to be driving a Mercedes—Benz and
writing about aspects of American
government instead.

It's just hard to picture Lee Gutkind
with long hair, a leather jacket, boots
and leather gloves.

Back then, he did something very
different so he could effectively por-
tray something very different. The Lee
Cutkind of today is not looking to be

_ differ_ent.'Thisis a refined Lee Gut-

kind. He speaks clearly, with the eyes
behind the dar_k—rimmed spectacles
often speaking a sentence of their
own. He is Lee Gutkind, I987. He is
not the same Lee Gutkind who rode
a motorcycle across America in 1970.

Bike Fever was the first book Lee
Gutkind ever published, close to 15
years ago. A lot has happened since
then. This native Pittsburgher, a
graduate of Taylor Allderdice High

I School, has written about a wide vari-

ety of topics. Besides describinglthe
life of your typical biker, he has
chronicled what it is like to be a
baseball umpire, and he has revealed
what living in backwoods America
entails. ,

Cutkind is a changed man.

”When_ it happened, I realized that

less than a year, when his most re-

effort to date, which gives him good

Lee Gutkind had a problem.

It was nearly four years ago. He
had just wasted six months trying to
infiltrate Lebanon so he could gather
information for his next book — a
work on the war between Lebanon
and Israel. After exhausting nearly ev-
ery resource he had trying to get into
the country, he gave up.

He decided to spend the rest of his
.vacation in Israel before returning to
Pittsburgh.

When he arrived home he saw a
stack of mail — eight months’ worth
— waiting for him. It was not an in-
viting sight. ’

But on top of the mail was an issue
of Newsweek magazine. On the
cover was a very inviting sight.

The cover story for that week was
”The Replaceable. Body.”

’fIt was the transplant story,” Gut-
kind recalled. :”I was leafing through

- it, and I kept seeing Pittsburgh, Pitts-

burgh, Pittsburgh  Starzl, Starzl,
Starzl [referring to Presbyterian-
University Hospital transplant pioneer
Dr. Thomas Starzl].

”I thought, ‘What am .I doing 6,000

miles away from Pittsburgh when the.

biggest story of the past quarter-
century is right_across the street from
where I work?’ ” '
And so the idea was born. This was

THE PITT .WRITElQS CONFERENCE, Wednesday, March 25, I987

Heller still working to iprove after Catch—22

By Christopher Sepesy
with Matthew Thornton
Contributing Editors

he publication of a first novel is a difficult and

harrowing experience for any writer. To that,

many accomplished authors will agree.
Joseph Heller is one of these authors.

To be published, it is usually necessary to be
known. To be known, it is necessary to be pub-
lished. To understand, it just might be necessary to
be crazy.

It is, according to Heller, ”better to get bad
reviews than no reviews, but sometimes it's even
hard to get bad reviews.”

Life, admittedly, is full of paradoxes, of Catch—22s
if you will. What man would know better the na-
ture of the catch than the man credited with its
conception. ’

Joseph Heller, as a special presenter at the Tenth
Annual Writers’ Conference, will speak of his life .
and writing. For the aspiring author, he is a model
of sucess, a best-selling novelist and ‘a profound in-
fluence on post—war literature.

Have you met all of your childhood dreams and
aspirations? According to Heller, he has.

”|’ve met them all, believe it or not. I'm one of
those grand people whose childhood daydreams
came true,” Heller said. "And I've done much bet-
ter than I thought I would." ‘

For a man who didn't have his first novel pub-
lished until he was 38, Heller has done remarkably
well in what many consider a fickle literary climate.
Why then did his first book, Catch—22 — one which
almost completely went against the normal literary
standards of its day — catch the public’s fancy the
way it did?

”I can only say that it is a pretty good book,”
chuckled Heller. ”But as far as it goes, I really don't
know,-just that at first, when it was in hardcover,

. there were obstacles. It was really only in paper-

back that it attracted such a large audience.

"With anyone’s first novel it is hard to attract a I
large audience. The second. thing is that it came out
at the time of the year just before the Christmas sea-
son. That makes book stores reluctant to stock
books by unknown authors. And then there's the
other factor, that Catch-22 is quite the unorthodox
book.” - ‘

Young writing students often ask how to write.
There seems to be a feeling that if one can emulate
the writing process of an accomplished author, the

Managing Editor

peaking with Bob
Greene over the phone,
‘one gets the impression
that though he is a
professional interviewer, he is
also quite accomplished at being
interviewed.

On this particular Wednesday
afternoon, he is on the road
somewhere in America —— as he
is on many days throughout the
year. His ”beat” as a columnist
for the Chicago Tribune often
takes him out of the Midwest and
anywhere between either shore
of the continental United States.
A veteran interviewer, he carries
no tape recorder and no list of
questions with him. His intention
in interviewing is simple — to
come away with a story to tell to
readers of over I 50 papers across
America. - .

Book promotion and television -
commentary, on the other hand,
have left him at ease as an inter-
view subject. Eight books, includ-
ing the bestselling Good
Morning, Merry Sunshine: A
Father's /ournal of His Child's
First Year and working as a con-
tributing reporter on ABC's
Nightline keep him well—trained
and comfortable.

The answer to this is obviously another question:
How does anyone write? They write, they sit and
sweat ideas. What else is there to say? But these

ideas, each separate and fresh in their own right,

work. . _

four published novels. Catch—22, Something Hap-
pened, Good as Gold, and God Knows; all best-
sellers, all brilliant and all different. Very different.

”I know I don't want to imitate myself. That would .

prove to me I've had a failure of inspiration," Heller
said. ”So what's happened, without me consciously
thinking about it, is that all my writing is different.

”Each book changes from its predecessor. I guess
you could say, in terms of a book's personality,
Good as Gold is closer to Catch—22, and God
Knows is probably closerto Something Happened.
But even there, there are big differences between
the pairs I've just mentioned.” ‘

With Catch—22, or any of his novels, Heller claims
to have found no obstacles. ”No obstacles, none -

whatsoever.” Hard to believe, buttrue, according to’

Heller.
”I just wanted to write the book,” Heller said. "I '
didn't do any in between writing. Writing the novel

was more of a hobby than a vocation. I did it in the.

evenings and on the weekends.
"And my work was by no means a fluke. You
never have a fluke. I wanted to write the book.
"I’m interested in doing work that ‘makes me hap-
py and that I really enjoy doing. Just so it's good.”

And good is something Heller has never seemed
to have trouble with. With most authors, the good
books are the high points of a literary terrain
marked clearly by valleys. Heller climbs. He, like
the mountain explorer, pushes always higher, rarely,
if ever, losing ground.

”_I like to think when I sit down that the work I'm
doing there is going to be better than any I've done
before,” he said. '’I'm constantly trying to
improve."

But doesn't it ever get hard, doesn't he ever falter,

' even just alittle?

"I really can't cope with the idea of somebody
who's stuck. .If I find myself in that position, it's
usually because I'm tired,” Heller said. ”I've never ’
really experienced what's been billed as the
‘writer's block.’ I always know what I want to write.

”I don't begin until I_ know there's an ending and.
a good sense of what goes in between.” 

Heller does have some advice — some pragmatic
and sound advice.

”The advice I give to anyone who wants to write ‘
is just to write — you have nothing to lose except

postage.”

School: A Diary of .1964, is based’
on that diary and the year he
describes as the last year of inno-
cence in American history. The

1964, he said, still had their feet
in the '50s. The strife and "inter-
nal conflict sparked by the civil

country.

Breaking barriers
  Reed: ’There is no such country as Whiteland’

THE PITT WRITERS CONFERENCE, Wednesday, March 25, 1937

By Teresa Candori
News Editor I "

All American literature is eth-
nic literature, Ishmael Reed con-
tends, and he is working to
eliminate the mindset that
separates the two classifications.

’’I can't think of anybody who's
not ethnic,” said Reed, presently
a visiting professor of literature at
Harvard University. ”There is no
such country as Whiteland.”

The author of six novels, four
books of poetry and two collec-

- tions of essays, Reed is a mem-

ber of the‘ faculty at the University
of California at Berkeley and the
Chairman of the Board of the Be-
fore.Columbus Foundation.
’/It's a foundation of writers

,.from different ethnic back-

grounds-— Italian, Irish, Asian,
Hispanic and Native American,”

. Reed said. ”We sponsor a multi-

cultural institute, where writers
from different backgrounds teach
prose and poetry.”

The Foundation, founded in
1976, has been picked up by San

‘ Jose University, which Reed said
"is the first American university to

run a mu|ti—cultural curriculum.
”We’re trying to create a multi-

. cultural university in this country
< because we don't see that the cul-

tural and educational establish-

ment recognizes the notion of

ethnicity," Reed said.

Reed contended th-at the

American cultural, educational
and intellectual establishment

 we don't see that

of ethnicity.
— Ishmael Reed

perpetuates the idea of white
supremacy.

”We don't see any difference
between the kind of attitude that
the [Ku Klux] Klan showed in For-
sythe County and the attitude of
someone who puts out an anthol-
ogy of poetry or prose in which
there are very few women, no
Hispanics, Asians, Native Ameri-
cans,” Reed said.

Reed is the co—publisher of
Quilt, an annual anthology of
short stories. Reed's publishing
company, I. Reed Books, recent-
ly published the first book of
poetry byran Eskimo woman.

When the cultural and educa-
tional establishment promotes
ethnic writers, they are promot-
ed as tokens, Reed said.

”What they do is deny that ta-
lent is common among groups
that are not white and male,” he
said. To promote one writer as a
token of ‘a certain‘ ethnic group
implies that the writer has tran-
cended his or her ethnic group.

Just as the goal of the Before
Columbus Foundation is to
change entrenched attitudes
about ethnic literature, the There
City Cinema is breaking out of
the cultural stereotypes that per-
vade motion pictures.

There City Cinema, of which
Reed is president, was named for
a famous quote about Oakland,
Calif., where the group is locat-
ed. Gertrude Stein, who lived in
Oakland, said, ”There’s no there
there.” ' .

There City Cinema conducts
multi-ethnic film festivals.

”|talian—Americans complain
about the ’Rocky’ stereotype,
Irish-Americans complain about
the stereotype of the Irish cop,”
he explained. 4

Though Reed has been called
”the most revolutionary black
novelist who has appeared in
print thus far,” he said the charac-
terization refers to his writing
style, not its content. Reed
characterized his style as ”a
hybrid of many different forms.”

' His latest novel, Reckless Eye— -
balling, is a send-up of the theat-
er scene. Reckless Eyeballing was
published last March by St. Mar-
tin’s Press. .

Reed was nominated for Na-
tional Book Awards for both
poetry and fiction in 1973 and

THE. PITT‘ WRITERS CONFERENCE, Wednesday, March 25, 1937

Hazo proliﬁc among poets in Pittsburgh

By Cathy Brennan

For the Pitt News

am Hazo, Pittsburgh's

premier poet and inter-

nationally known na-

tive, has done a great
deal to bring international pres-
tige to Pittsburgh as a literary
center.

In 1966, in a city that seemed
to have very little aesthetic qual-
ity, Hazo.founded the Interna-
tional Poetry Forum of Pittsburgh.
He picked Pittsburgh because it
was his home. V

’’Pittsburgh. is a ‘real’ city. 
The people here have an impa-
tience with sham,” said Hazo.

The Poetry Forum, which just
celebrated its 20th anniversary
season, is an organization that

' brings poets and writers from all

over the world who read their
work for Pittsburghers. -
In the beginning, Pittsburgh

was hardly considered to be fer-
tile ground for poetry, but the In-
ternational Poetry, Forum has
proved there is an audience for
poetry in Pittsburgh. The poetry
forum is now nationally and in-
ternationally known by poets and
writers as a world-class insti-
tution. ’

By bringing such greats as Ten-
nessee Williams, Kurt Vonnegut,
John Updike and even Princess
Grace of Monaco to Pittsburgh,
poets and people who love
poetry have come to know that
in Pittsburgh there is a ”confirm—
ing-presence for poetry and an
audience that is indispensable to
completing the poetic ex-
perience,” according to Hazo.

Hazo is a professor of English
at Duquesne University. He
works to be one of those ”good
teachers” like the few that in-
spired him.

Hazo is also very concerned

    

Sam Hazo

with student appreciation of
poetry. This concern has carried
over into the work of the poetry
forum. Itmakes a concerted effort
to reach students in high school
to enhance their appreciation of
poetry, by bringing poets into

their classrooms to read poems.

’’If the students can be reached
then,” said Hazo, "the chances
are good that they might learn
that poetry was not meant to be
intimidating but to be moving
and exciting andieven fun.”

Hazo attended the University
of Notre Dame, Duquesne
University and the University of
Pittsburgh, respectively. When he
started college, he didn't intend
to be a writer. He had his sights
set on being a lawyer. He be-
came interested in poetry_through
”a couple of good teachers and
reading the works of admired
poets.”

Hazo said that poetry is not just
another use for language. ’’It is
another language. Its only pur-
pose is to attempt to say what
cannot be said or what is best
said in silence.”

According to Hazo, poetry is
important now because we live

he rewrite. It is perhaps
one of the most difficult
tasks to accept as neces-
sary in writing. When

, surrendering to its necessity, the

author is accepting that an origi-
nal work — for all the hours and
sweat poured into it — just isn't
good enough.

It is also one ofthe most criti-
cal steps leading to a solid work,
according to William T. Gardner,
producing director of the Pitts-
burgh Public Theater.

Gardner is the first to accept the
need for rewriting in plays, but he
often finds the rewrite a difficult
thing to force a playwright into
doing. _ .

coined the phrase, ”Genius

ration.”

He wasn’t referring to theatrics,
but he easily could have been.
Broadway has contributed to the
writer's inspiration. But the
modern American playwright,
dedicated to the creation of art,

is no longer writing for
Broadway.
Arthur Giron, head of the

playwriting program at Carnegie
Mellon University,,said, ”With
the decentralization of theater,
non—profit companies offer the

‘writer a greater chance to be’

more artistic with his work. The

production involves being able to

~ work with the producer, director

and actors,” Gardner said. ”|t’s a
collaborative art, and those who
don't know howto rewrite will
have a difficult time making a
production,successfu|.” _ g

Gardner ‘came to Pittsburgh
from New York three years ago
and has made it his mission to im-
prove the reputation and follow-
ing in the theater of Pittsburgh.
For several years, ‘he served at
Chicago's Acadamy Festival
Theatre, producing many works
by Eugene O'Neill. A Moon for
the Misbegotten, in which Gard-
ner worked with Jason Robards
and Colleen Dewhurst,» received
four Tony Awards. A

He came to Pittsburgh after see-
ing the potential for great theater
in the city.

longer working with a studio sys-
tem. A Chorus Line is a good
example.” A . ,

A‘ native of New York City, Gi-
ron will be one of six writers fea-
tured at Pitt's Tenth Annual
Writers’ Conference. Although he
is based in New York, Giron
works out of Pittsburgh and quite
frequently writes in Los Angeles.

Scheduled to speak at 10 a.m.,

Saturday, March 28 at the Pitts-
burgh. Public Theater, Giron will
discuss the ”secret life of a

playwright.” Topics that will be

looked at include; how to support
yourself, family aspects and how
a play is created.

Giron noted that he didn't al-
ways want--to be a playwright.
Originally, he planned to be-

”The availability of quality ac-

he said. ”We’re trying to develop
a recognition for the city so that
more people will think of work-
ing here as a possibility.

”It’s very much a developing

his writing career was ”nipped in

Jewish philosopher martyred at

”I was simply fascinated with '

her. I-stopped acting in favor of

ever since,” he said.

His works include: Edith Stein,

he Tenth Annual Writers’
Conference feature’s distin-
guished literary figures

, such as Joseph Heller and
Bob Greene — it will also allow The

 

’ Pitt News alumni to gather for a re-

union dinner Friday night at the Wil-
liam Pitt Union Ballroom.

”It’s’the bicentennial conference,
and we've made some extra efforts,”
said Lee Gutkind, founder and chair-
man of the .Writers’ Conference. ”We
have Bob Greene and Joseph Heller,
two big-name people. This.is also the
first time we've tried to put The Pitt

J News together with the conference

through The Pitt News reunion.”
The careers of The Pitt News alum-

. ni. range from a former editor-in-chief

of The Pittsburgh Press — Leo Koe-
berlein ——- "to a historian for Westing— =
house — Charles A. Ruch. Alumni are
coming from all over the country as

A well as from overseas.

”The response from the alumnihasl
been very enthusiastic,” said Gutkind.
”I’m going to the whole confer-

‘ ence,” Toby Trosky, Pitt News editor-

in-chief in 1984-85. ”This is probably
going to be the best one they've
had.” '

Koeberlein, Pitt News editor-in-chief

in 1937-38 and former Pittsburgh
Press editor said, ”I’ve enjoyed the
last couple of Writers’ Conferences,
and I’m especially looking forward to
this one because I'll see old friends.”
”This weekend I'm coming for The
Pitt News reunion and for some of
the events of the Writers’ Conference.
I want to hear Joseph Heller and Bob

Greene,” said Jack Markowitz, who is

a former Pitt News managing editor
and is currently the business editor of
the Greensburg Tribune—Review.
Many alumni expressed the desire
to see ’’old friends" at the dinner.
Cindy Morgan, a former entertain-
‘ment editor who now works in New
York City in advertising and public
relations, said, ”I want to see every-
-“-‘one and how they turned out.”
”This particular year,” said Robert
Machesney, Pitt News editor-in-chief
in 1932, ”I am going to the confer-
ence because of the dinner. I'd like
to see who else will be there.”
Oscar Shefler, assistant editor from
the class of 1941 is also coming to”
the dinner to see ’’old friends.”
According to Shefler, alumni are
coming in fromCalifornia, Kansas
and possibly Paris to attend the
reunion.
During the alumni dinner, many of
the former staff members will
reminisce about their, experiences

A THE PITT WRITERS CONFERENCE, Wednesday, March 25, 1987

with The Pitt News. 1

According to Robert Machesney,
the Pitt News was called the Pitt
Weekly back in 1932. ”We published
eight pages, sometimes more, every
week. Our equipment consisted of a
few broken-down typewriters with
two or three keys missing in a
thrown-together office.”

”It was pretty raw and unfinished,”
said Shefler. ”We had manual type-
writers, and we used cheap copy
paper from the printer. We were up _
on the eighth floor of the Cathedral
of Learning. The walls weren't even
finished back then.”

Frank Davis, former news editor,
class of '47, said, ”In my junior and
senior year, we initiated The Pitt
News as a biweekly publication. It
was a social as well as journalistic
group. Tightly knit.”

”We had a lot of fun putting out
the paper” said Koeberlein. ”You
naturally gravitated to the other peo-
ple as college friends, even though
you may have had a great disparity of
interest.” ‘

Markowitz also said his staff be-
came very close. ”There were always
a few of us who were nuts enough to
be at the paper constantly. It got to
the point where classes became extra-
curricular activity.”

During recent interviews, many Pitt

A And youthought they would go away. . .

News alumni agreed the newspaper
was fun to work on, but it also
provided valuable experience for their
careers.

”I learned more from working for
The Pitt News than anything I learned
in my classes,” said Ruch, a former
editor and sports editor.

Morgan said, ’’It was a start. You
have to start somewhere. At least it

' exposed you to what you better learn

and better find out.”

Gutkind said the hardest part of the
dinner‘ was finding the alumni.

”The hardest thing about putting
this all together was that we didn't
have the names of anybody,” Gut-
kind said.

.Marcia Bionta, who has worked
with Gutkind organizing the alumni
reunion'and the writers conference,
said, ”We started with a list of all the

‘papers. We got the names off of the

mastheads. Then we started calling
them and asking for more names. We
started with almost 2,000 names and
found the addresses of about 700 and
invited them to the reunion.

”It took me from October to the
end of December to get all the num-
bers, but I was very pleased to see
the response I got. Now people are
calling me and telling me that they've
heard about the conference.”

reader on the basic level of a
storyteller. Often the curiosity of
and awe of a young boy are
found in the pieces he does. His
subjects are what he feels the
general American would be in-
terested in or fascinated by.

”In this case [Be True to Your
School], people are saying that
even though I'm writing specifi-
cally about myself and my friends

growing up in the middle of the
country in the middle of the cen-

tury, the emotions that come.

through are universal, and they're
seeing their own lives.
’’I think that's what it is —— peo-

ple read the stuff I write and see.

their own lives.”

The collections of columns that
have been gathered into books
such as American Beat in 1983
and Cheesburgers: The Best of

Bob Greene in 1985 do not leave
a reader with a feeling that the
writing of Greene is somehow as-

tounding. ‘What the reader is left .
with is the fact that America is‘

truly an amazing country — often
bizarre.

”The times are different. It used
to be that you'd go out to a murd-
erlscene or a fire scene and write
a sidebar about it for the next
day's paper that would be

startling information for the read-
er,” he said. ”Now, with the atl-
vent of the mini-cam, they see it
on the news.

”I think that column writing
has gone from being almost a
news sidebar to almost like letters
from home or getting letters from
a friend. One of the things I had
to take into consideration in 1976

V when the column went into na-

tional syndication is that frankly

a paper wouldn't be interested in

running my column if all I did ’

was sidebars on Chicago crimes.
”What I do is still reporting, but
it's reporting of a different kind —

it's reportingon the way people

live their lives.’’

Bob Greene will be speaking at

‘(I never wanted to be a doctor

A‘ -  when’I~was little, and I have no am-

bition to be one now,” Lee Gutkind

said with asmile. '
Regardless, Gutkind has spent a

large part of the mid-'80s hanging

‘V . around hospitals. He has talked with

surgeons, nurses and, of course, trans-
plant patients'— among others.

And it was during these prepara-
tions for Many Sleepless Nights,

when the changes in_Lee Gutkind the I

writer and Lee Gutkind, the perso
began taking place. . ‘

V ’’I was changed when I had to
spend days" and nights in the trans-
plant units with the patients, families,
and doctors,” he said. '

His somewhat laid-back approach
J. toghandling problems is very notice-
. able. Through studying transplant pa-
tients, Gutkind said he has learned

_ A - that there are people in the world i
'  ,with much more serious problems

than his.
”You learn to keep these things in

v A‘ perspective,” he said of the problems
1 he ‘faces, such as in organizing the

annual Pitt Writers’ Conference.
”There are more important things to

- worry about.”

He has also learned to prevent
-problems — such as his own health
problems. He willingly sold his
motorcycle, he said, because ofwhat
‘he saw in_ many hospitals across the

 world during his.research -— brain-
, dead"vic_tims of motorcycle accidents. -
’ He has also been equally in—.’; ‘V V.

fluenced as a writer. So ‘much so that

he will concentrate his writings in the

medical/transplant field in the future.

”I think even if I moved back to
fiction, the story would have a medi-
cal background,” he. said.

C
Lee Gutkind was not allowed to
.write for The Pitt News as an under-
graduate. The newspaper did not per-
mit night school students to write.

At that time, Pitt did not offer
journalism-type classes either.

Ironically, as a part-time instructor
in 1973, Gutkind agreed to teach a I
one-credit introductory course for
writers at The Pitt News. It was the \
beginning of a great relationship and
.what would be the many more
journalism-type classes at the
university.

In 1975, Gutkind invented the
Writers’ Conference, and has_or-
ganized it and run it ever since. He
also serves as chairman of the Stu-
dent Publications Board, in effect the
publisher of The Pitt News and Pan-
ther Prints, Pitt’s yearbook.

He said the Writers’ Conference is

" for the students. The Pitt News is for

the students, as is Panther Prints. In
effect, Lee Gutkind is for the students.
I ’ And perhaps it is only a matter of
time before national recognition will
take him away from the students.

Instead of organizing a writers’ con-
ference, perhaps he will be the key-
note speaker'at one. »
