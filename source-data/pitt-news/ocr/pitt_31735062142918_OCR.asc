I000 Prepare For Graduation

‘Greatest Reunion Yeti

Planned by

The Alumni association is planning what it conﬁdently expects
to be the “greatest reunion yet”--a homecoming celebration to in-
clude all members of the senior class, as well as alumni.

The program has been planned especially to dovetail in with sen- _
ior events and prevent conﬂicts i_n¢

the two schedules.
First on the list of events is the

‘Sunset dinner, sponsored annu-

ally for senior women by the
Alumni association. This year’s
dinner is scheduled for Monday,
June 9, in the University club at
6:30 p.m. Any girl who buys a

, $3.00 ticket for this affair auto-

matically receives a supporting
membership mthe association for
the following year.

All members of the graduating

class,‘ as, well as alumni, will be

admitted to the Reunion dance,
Tuesday, June 10, at the Hotel
Schenley from 10 to 1 p.m. Ad-
mission will be by the showing of
afmembership card in the Alumni
association, which is being sent
to all seniors. One member of each
couple must have one of these cer-
tiﬁcates.

' School dinners, open to all sen-
iors, too, are scheduled for, the
same night at 6:30 p.m. Reserva-

' tions must be made in advance.

Tuesday afternoon, while alum-
nae and senior women are attend-
ing the Coronation luncheon, al-
umni and senior men will meet
at a buffet luncheon in the Ca-
thedral cafeteria, beginning at
-12:30 p.m. Tickets for this lunch
are $1.00.

According to J. Clyde Barton,
secretary of the Alumni associa-
tion, all ‘graduates automatically
are members of the organization,
but a supporting member is one
who pays yearly dues. He em-
phasizes the fact that “All good
Pitt alumni become supporting

members.”

fDorts Phipps and Ed Lamb lead

Alumni

The first batch of 1947 Owls
—500 of them—will arrive at
the Owl office on June 2 or 3.
They will be distributed to stu-
dents on a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst serv-
ed basis. -

Owl printers further promise
that they will deliver the re-
maining 1000 copies of the year-
book by June 11.

All Students

The Pitt ROTC makes its post-
war social debut tomorrow night
at Syria Mosque when Cadet 1st
Lieutenant Edward J. Lamb and
his date, Doris Phipps, lead oﬁ the
Corps’ Military ball to the music
of Maurice Sp_italny’s orchestra.

At noon today, tickets for the
dance will be put on the block
to all students, thus refuting the
semi-closed affair originally plan-
ned. Each member of the Corps
was permitted to__ invite one addi-
tional guest. Tickets ar-e $3 per
couple. ,

In addition to the Pitt uniforms,
a large number of “service sacks”
should be in evidence as well as
the more conventional formal civ-
vies. Guests and other students
attending "may wear either their
service uniform or formal dress.

Dancing will be from 8 p.m. to
midnight, with tapping by Scab-
bard and Blade military fraternity
scheduled for the inter-mission,

One of the leading social events
on each year’s calendar before
the war, tomorrow night’s Mili-
tary ball represents an extensive
effort by the committees to re-

store the event to that same pre-

war level.

Chairman Edward Lamb has ~

been assisted by Bill Lytle as the
publicity chairman.

Of ‘Great

D.-. Farmer To Tell

Tradition’

Over ‘1000 seniors practice switching their tassel from right
to left in anticipation of the 1947 spring graduation that will
be held on the University campus between the Cathedral and
Heinz Chapel, Wednesday, June 11, at 10:30 a. in.

Dr. William R. Farmer, retiring chaplain of the University,
will deliver the commencement address, “The Great Tradition.”
Dr. Farmer is retiring from active campus activities this spring

Festival Results
In Lost Weekend,

‘Spring festival was a “Lost
Weekend” for three Pitt students.

Barbara Heinz lost a brown Cor-
da. bag, envelope type, with a
white plastic compact inside. John
Wright is missing one grey gab-
ardine topcoat, size 38, labeled
“Berkman’s-—Beaver Falls.” Both
articles were last seen at the Grand
Ball. ' '

A light tan covert cloth, top-
coat bearing a Kaufmann label
was lost by Milton Lebowitz at
the Tea Dance.

Those who found these articles
are asked to return them to the
lost and found booth, ground floor.

after serving the University as

‘chaplain for eight years.

This year’s commencement
marks the70th anniversary of Dr.
George H_ Clapp’s graduation. He
received the Doctor of Philosophy
degree from the Western Univer-

sity of Pennsylvania in 1877. Dr.
Clapp was elected a member of
the board of trustees in 1902, and
has served as president of that
board since 1907.

Ushers for the commencement’
have been announced by Chancel-V
lor Fitzgerald as:

Trefoil. ROTC members will act
as military aides at all entrances
to the commencement area. The
University ban-d will play the na-
tional anthem, alma mater, and
several other songs.

Graduation exercises will trans-
fer to Syria Mosque in case of in-
clement weather. Because the
space in the Mosque is limited,
only three rain tickets will be
provided each graduate. Other-
wise, ten tickets will be provided
each graduate for the use of their
families and friends.

Graduating seniors may apply
for tickets at the offices of their
respective schools, beginning May
26. Other interested persons may
obtain tickets, while the supply
lasts, by applying at the office of
the Chancellor.

Dr. Fitzgerald will present the
diplomas to the graduates. Degrees
will be conferred on undergradu-
ates, and candidates for masters
and doctors degrees.

School SpiritStruggles Thru Year for Recognition

Overall Analysis of Year’s Activities’

Reveals Strong and Weak Response

As the school year ground to a close it was evi-
dent that something was missing at Pitt this year.
Joe College was conspicuously absent, replaced by
grade-hungry education seekers who wanted no
part of campuslife in any shape or" form and made
their feelings on this matter known early and often.

. Everyone discussed tl1ese results and speculated
about the causes, trying tolpin it down to a single
reason. Some said the inﬂux of GI students brought
about the disinterest in student affairs; some in-
sisted everything, was attributable solely to the in-
creased enrollment; others averred it was a natural
letdown following the hectic war years; some cursed
the administration claiming the fault lay there._

Whatever the cause, the results were obvious;
Campus activities, with few exceptions, ﬂopped like
a sack of sand. ‘ _

Attempted revival of the cheering block suf-

rfercd a quick, but painful death. Lack of coopera-

tion among students who insisted on sitting in the
cheering section without the blue and gold rain

‘capes spoiled the overall effect. James Hagan and

his athletic ofﬁce squeezed the remaining life from
the block by banning use of loud speakers on the
basis that such speakers were annoying to the
“Paying” customers. Without the loud speakers to
cordinate maneuvers, the cheering block gave up
its ghost. » ~

Cap and gown club returned to campus life

 

momentarily to produce an original musical, “Kilroy

Is Here.” All agreed the, production was far be-

low the standards set up’
casts.

G-rover l\/IcCann, Owl business manager, pur-
chased two radios to give away with 1947 Owls.
Resultant Owl sales were up 90 per cent over. those
of 1946. The ’46 Owl, by the way, ﬁnally appeared
at the eighth ﬂoor office. As late as last week, peo-
ple were still tracking down Bill McElwa.in trying
to get their copies——12 months late.

Also tardy in arrival was the Cwen student di-
rectory which contained the usual misplaced names
andtelephone numbers when «it ﬁnally reached the
distribution stage in February. The Cwens tried
their best but couldn’t sell all their-directories. The
loss was absorbed by the University. ‘

We sold our Mines building with its antiquated
indoor track along with Trees Gym and the ad-
joining area to the Veterans administration as a
site for a proposed veterans hospital. Pitt News
was up in the air about the loss of the indoor
track. Students generally didn’t care. Most students
didn’t even know there was such a. place on the
campus.

The administration promised a new track house,
several new temporary buildings to house classes,
a hangar-type Air Corps building to serve as a ﬁeld
house, and ﬁnally a s'tudent union. Chancellor Fitz-
gerald stated he didn’t know where he’d get the
funds_or where he’d put the buildings or what kind
of bulldngs he would have, but assured all that’

faith would ﬁnd a way. Pitt students began to
wonder “When?”

The Panther crawled from its wartime lair to
publish three editions which showed promise of
regaining former Panther stature when discussing
campus life.

The wrath of the administration fell on the
heads of the staff when publibity posters were
placed throughout the campus bearing the inscrip-
tion “Vladimir Boobasmear buys the Panther -be-
cause it’s sexier.” The University received pub-
licity in downtown papers making the Administra-
tion’s Mid-Victorian attitude appear somewhat ri-
diculous. ~

More publicity of the same order followed
when all three downtown papers and several na-
tion-wide news‘ service grabbed the story about the
letter sent by the, dean of women banning displays
of affection on the lawns. _

Ursula Halloran was selected as the favorite
brunette of the University, later of the City of

Pittsburgh and we11t to Hollywood in a blaze of 0

publicity. The office of the dean of women opposed
the contest on the grounds that “Pitt women would
be judged in terms of their measurements” and that

a true representative of Pitt women might not be -

selected. The office had nolcomment on the choice
of Miss Halloran.

Department of “Lest We Forget.”

Back in December when snow
was whirling around our lime-
stoneimonument, a feminine News
photographer came charging into
the oﬁice with the revelation that
“there must be a locker shortage
because the Ground Floor ladies
room is full of coats.”

The editors assured her that she
was 013‘ her base, that a benevo-

would never inconvenience the
student body. Most of the editors
rejected the suggestion that we
investigate the situation.

It just couldn’t happen here!

Editor, The Pitt News

Today, I am sending to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette the fol-
lowing letter:

“In last Friday’s edition of your
paper there appears a picture of
me with three other students from
Pitt and under the picture a quote
that I was supposed to have made
about the way students dress.

I wish to deny this quote. I
was not interviewed. I was sim-

for the paper that was to be used
in an article on campus wear and
so far as opinions, I wasn’t asked
for one_

The quote was very unfair. I
did not say it and'I fully appre-
ciate the attitude of the veterans.
Hats oﬁ to them and I am glad
they are willing to sacrifice today
in order to have an ‘ educated
world tomorrow.”

I would appreciate the publica-
tion of this in the Pitt News as I
would like my position made clear.
Yours truly,

Festival Committee

Reveals Net Proﬁts
Tabulation from the Spring Fes-
tival comittee this week revealed
that the tremendous success of
the grand ball has scared the net
proﬁt for the week upward to
$2000.

All festival events realized a
margin of surplus. Attendance at
each activity was large enough to
cover expenses, and in most cases
-there was an appreciable proﬁt
gmade. Incomplete returns from
the grand ball reveal that there

were approximately 5500 dancing
people at the affair.

as the therapeutic team. Owing
to the wide interest and heavy
demand in such a program, Dr.
William Groves, director of the
Division of Psychological Services,
regrets to have to limit enrollment
to graduate students and practic-
ing professionals in the ﬁelds of
medicine and social work.

As there are no qualiﬁed in-
structors available from the over-

worked psychology department,
plans have been made to invite a
group of guest lecturers. Each
guest will handle the course for
one week, instructing on the spe-
cialized topic with which he is
most familiar. Included in this
group are Gregory Zilboorg, M.D.,

Raimy, Ph.D., of Ohio State Uni-

versity.

Somewhere along the line Jack Grimes resigned as presi-

Workmaster Worked for Vet club recognition by the adminis-

ﬁcial sanction late in the spring
semester.

Several members of the asso-
ciation’s board of governors re-
signed and were replaced in a
ﬂurry of name-calling, and loose-
ly thrown accusations against the
regime in power.

‘bit of money, and brought from
-the office of the dean of men the
deeply profound statement that
the $350 proﬁt meant either the
ticket price was too high or the
dancers did not get their money’s
worth.

I Other dances, notably the Stu-

money. The IF Snow and Spar-

In Successes

Pitt Players have taken their
ﬁnal curtain call for the 1946-47
season. ’ ' _

Reﬂecting on the success of
“Joan of Lorraine,” the student
dramats already have begun
plans-for an ambitious season next
year. A specialcommittee will
spend the summer perusing the
most successful Broadway plays.

According to Dr. George W.
Crouch, associate professor of
English, and Buell B. Whitehill,
assistant professor of speech,
“Joan of Lorraine” was one of the
best theatrical productions ever
staged at the University. Con-
scientious acting and skilled di-
rection, brought large crowds to
the Memorial for the s-how’s three-
night stand and better than $400

IS PEACE POWER

Reactivation of the Aviation Cadet program is typical
of the AAF’s continuing effort to provide selected young
men every opportunity to earn advancement. Cadets
who Win their wings as today’s pilots will be the same
kind of men who, in wartime, built and manned the

world’s mightiest air arm.

ing immediately after graduation, you can take your
qualifying examinations and enter the July 1st class,
or—if you want a summer vacation —you can take

class beginning October 15th. Further in-

A

 

formation is available ;at AAF Bases, U. S.

The twice-postponed intramur-
al track meet has been reschedul-
ed for Monday afternoon at 4:30
p.m. at the stadium. Entries are
still being accepted at the intra-
mural oﬁice. ,

Events to be run off include:
75-yard dash, 300-yd., 600=.yd, and
three—quarter mile runs, low and
high hurdles, shot put and high
jump. ,

Revamping of the stadium turf
prevented javelin and broad jump
events. ‘

Penn State rolls into town to-
morrow to help Pitt pull down the
curtain on its 1947 tennis and golf
seasons. The linksmen play host
to the Lions at Shannopin Coun-

'. try club while the tennis squad

goes against the Staters on the
Westinghouse courts.

The visiting Penn State tennis-
men have been having just about
the same trouble winning match-
es as Dr. O’Laughlin’s Panthers.

T.h.e opening match will pit
State star and captain, Walt Sten-
ger,. against Pitt’s Stan Weil.
Coach Fogg has been using Herb
Beckhard, Dick Greenawalt, Bob
Tuttle, Dick Clarkson, and Frank
Pessolano in recent matches. The
Panther mentors, O’Laughlin and
Artman are expected to counter

twice on foreign fairways, 6-3 at

For Future College Track Meets

By John Golightly

Carl Olson is a man with an idea and a lot of pride.
been the Pitt Track coach and Director of Intramural athletics and
required phys ed for the last 15 years. During that time, the idea

has grown and his pride has matched it all the way.

The pride: is all for “his boys” whose number runs into the

hundreds.

“T-heir loyalty is a source of
constant inspiration,” he conﬁded.
“They don’t have the proper train-
ing facilities, and the weather is
often bad. But I_never saw kids
who worked so hard.

“They just carry me right along
on their enthusiasm. Not only
that,” he continued, “but I don’t
know of a single boy who hasn’t
been a credit to the University.

They’re Students First

“They’re students and gentle-
men ﬁrst, and athletes second,”
he emphasized.

There was a quiet pride about
his feeling for ,the track perform-
ers, butlfor his idea, he expressed
ardent enthusiasm. “In compari-
son to football, track meets don’t
get much spectator response,” he
admitted. ’ V '

“But if we could put on a regu-
lar Intercollegiate or AAU Invi-
tational, I think We could come

is deﬁnitelyon the upswing.

“If you need any evidence on
that score, just check the attend-
ance at high school night track
meets.”

Mention of the high schools
brought to mind that two very
successful district mentors —— Al
Ferrara (Donora) and Dick Ma-
son (connellsville)-—-learned their
track savvy under Olson.

Two Big Moments

As a member of the Tri-State
Coaches association and as a fre-
quent speaker at high school ban-

quets, Mr. Olson has done much’

to further interest in the cinder
sport.

Of the many "memorable inci-
dents in his 15 years as track
coach, he selected two events as
the most satisfying.

“One was the Intercollegiate
meet in Boston in 1939,” he re-
called. “We didn’t win a single
ﬁrst place and yet, we won the
meet.

His other incident concerns the

now legendary long John Wood-
ruff who was the ﬁrst American
since 1912 tc win the 8-010 meter
event in the Olympics.
Woodruff Was Best

“That was in 1936,” he recol-
lected. “And I Was determined
that John wouldn’t make the same
error which others before him
had. I told him to take it easy in
the qualifying event. Johnny ran
nice and easy and ﬁnished third.

“Well, the Olympic committee
was all in a dither. They wanted
to know if he was overtrained,
sick, or what had happened. But
the next day they were silenced
when John speeded up and took
ﬁrst place in the semi—ﬁnals.

“And two days later, he won
the ﬁnals without too ‘much trou-
ble. He was my best,” Mr. Olson
concluded. ‘ ‘ _
