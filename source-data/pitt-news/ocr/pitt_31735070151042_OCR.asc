On the second ﬂoor of Trees Hall,
audible cheering emanates from

beyond a series of basketball‘

courts and behind a closed set of
double doors. Above the doors is
an iconic image of a gymnast in
mid-routine on a balance beam.
But does she stick the landing?
That question is all Pitt gym-
nastics head coach Debbie Yohman

' wonders about — not so much for

the girl on the sign, but certainly

‘for the team.

Yohman dubbed the Panthers’
2012-2013 season “The Year of the
Stick,” an abbreviated but powerful
reminder for the gymnasts to per-
fect their dismounts. If the audible
cheering from behind closed doors
is any indicator, Coach Yohman’s
message has, appropriately, stuck.

As Yohman described it, the
perfect dismount, a “stuck” land-
ing, involves three decisive points:

,acute levelness at and above the

shoulders, carefully bent knees
and holding the complete posi-
tion. Finish a ﬂawless routine with
those painstaking minutiae, and
the result should be an unblem-
ished score.

“We’re trying to clean up those
routines all the way through the

end by sticking every dismount,” '

Pitt’s LGBTQ advocacy group has

but their message of inclusion re-
mains the same.

For more than two decades,
the student group now known as

organization has its earliest roots in

greater interest in social activity —
a shift that has allowed the group to
connect with abroader swath of the
Pitt community. '
Although most universities
currently have some version of a

group supporting Lesbian-, Gay, Bi— a

sexual and Transgender students,
they are relatively new organiza-
tions that arose in the socio-political
atmosphere that pervaded America

only three decades ago. Pitt’s group _

was no exception. Earliest records
show a Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at the University of Pittsburgh in
1987, which quickly turned into the

STUDENT GOVERNMENT’

Club sports funding question

Mahita Gajanan
S tcyff I/I/rizfer

Pitt club golf team President David Uhrm-
acher urged the Student Government Board
to make changes to the Allocations process
during the open-ﬂoor session of Tuesday
night’s public meeting.

The problem, Uhrmacher said, is a feel-

' -ing among club sports teams that when it

comes to funding for competitions and
tournaments, the amount of money the
teams receive from SGB is not proportional
to the amount other student organizations
receive for their activities.

“They preach shared responsibility,” A

Uhrmacher said after the meeting. Yet,
as he sees it, the Board supports groups
who may not be providing their fair share
of the funds. '

The club,-sports funding question was
just one of the issues raised at the weekly
public SGB meeting held at Nordy’s Place
in the William Pitt Union. Outside of the
open-ﬂoor session, Board members updat-
ed the 30 or so meeting attendees on their
progress on their individual initiatives,
promoted upcoming events and reported
back concerning several members recent
lobbying trip to Washington, D.C.

The concept of shared responsibility

.-

that Urmacher referred to stems from
the Board’s tradition of allocating higher
amounts of money from the _Student Ac-
tivities Fund to campus organizations that
fundraise more within their groups.
According to Uhrmacher, many club
sports teams require a high out-of—pocket
fee from their members, and still receive
low funding from the Board. He cited the
club hockey team as an example, noting

that each member pays over $1,700 in team -

dues but receives only $500 per person
from SGB.

Uhrmacher offered a few suggestions
to address the inconsistency he percieved:
He said SGB could establish a club sports-
committee, assign a liaison to deal with the

. groups or revise the Allocations manual.

4 Board President Gordon Louderback
said he plans onmeetingjsoon with any
club sports team president who is con-
cerned about the Allocations process and
is willing to start a conversation about
the issue. i

“It would be a lotlmore constructive to
set up a meeting outside of public meet-
ing,” Louderback said. a

Louderback added, however, that he
did not have a strong sense that all of the
club sports teams were upset. Although
Uhrmacher, Louderback and the club

sports teams’ presidents were in email
contact to discuss Uhrmacher’s concern
prior to the meeting, Louderback said
some club sports teams were not aware
of Uhrmacher’s problem with the Alloca-
tions process. He added that some presi-
dents did not have any problems with the
way SGB allocated money toward the club
sports teams.

Louderback said he was looking for-
ward to what concerned club sports presi-

dents had to say and wanted to give them‘
the chance to voice their concerns and '

provide suggestions. , ,

Before the open-ﬂoor session Tuesday
night, Board members talked about their
accomplishments and what they would like
to see happen in the course of thisand the
next semester.

Board member Dave Rosenthal — who

I was recently named Ofﬁcer of the Month

for February — urged students to fill out

‘ a survey he passed around before the start

of the meeting to better understand how
students respond to the Collegiate Reader-
ship Program. , .

“We’re just trying to get feedback about
the Collegiate Readership Program,”
Rosenthal said.

ert Beecher spoke about the upcoming

Nourish International raises money, plans

Brett Wilson
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh has new clubs

popping up each semester, and one founded I

in the spring semester of 2012 is already at-
tempting to leaveeits mark on not only the
campus, but the world.

The Nourish International chapter at
Pitt is a club based entirely around college
students working in regions that have poor
sanitation and face many health issues. The

' mission of Nourish International is to com-

bat extreme poverty globally. The organiza-
tion has now raised more’ than $296,000
since 2006 to battle global poverty and

has extended to 24 college campuses in the a

United States.

And this summer, the students involved
in the club will be taking a six-week trip to
the Moche Valley of Peru to work on health
and sanitation issues faced by those living
in the region.

Alex Deuley, a sophomore business ma- '

jor, was one of the founders of Nourish In-

. ternational at Pitt.

“My sister at Ohio State is in Nourish,
and it seemed like a great program that I
really wanted to have at Pitt,” Deuley said.

Just one year after the foundation of
Nourish International at Pitt, the club al-

ready has about 20 to 30 members that are i

‘active within the club, and students are still
joining. Sophomore Rachel Marx joined only

v one month ago and said she already feels as

though she is in the Nourish International
family. ~ V -

“Itis_a great group of people who all have
a similar passion to help out those in need,”
Marx said. i i i P

This summer, Nourish club members i

embark on their six-week trip from May 30
until July 11. The trip coordinator, sopho-
more Ally Cross, has been eagerly awaiting
the trip since the group members chose their
destination in October. '

\ . “While there, we will be constructing

composting latrines for a region in Moche,”
Cross said. ' '
Composting latrines are vaults that ex-

. cretioncan be dropped into and, over time,

aerobically decomposed until the material
can be’used as fertilizer. .,
As Cross explained,'these composting
latrines are just a different style of toilet.
“Roughly 2.4 billion people lack access to
basic sanitation, and we may only be making

~- a small difference. But a lot of small differ-

ences can make a big difference,” Cross said.

Members of Pitt’s Nourish International
club will also run health and education cam-
paigns in M0 che to help improve sanitation
issues facing today’s world.

Cross also said that maternal mortality
is abig issuethey would like to ‘abate, as it
is a prevalentproblem in the Moche Valley
of Peru. ‘ V ' -  ’

While the club does not work ;with the
community of Pittsburgh, itself, itsihembers
are tryingto remind people here about the
issues faced by people all over the world.

“Theissues we are trying to combat can
be better done internationally, as the crises
they face are more severe when it comes to
an issue of sanitation and health,” Cross
said.

The Nourish International club at Pitt
also has exceeded many of its expectations
for the year. Originally, Pitt Nourish Inter-
national had hopes to raise $3,000 for the
people of Moche at the beginning of the
fall semester, but they have since doubled
that amount. -

The club hopes to continue raising money 
for its trip this summer and maybe even ap- .

proach a once-distant goal of $10,000. Pitt
Nourish International hopes to continue to

grow and take trips annually that help ﬁght .

records, homosexuals were nobetter or worse
than other soldiers.” _ '
Times were changing. The World Health

Organization removed homosexuality from ~

its International Classiﬁcation of Diseases
on May 17, 1990 — a daythat came to be
celebrated internationally by the LGBTQ
community.. '

All of these factors contributed to the rise
of groups such as BiGALA. Tricia Dougherty,
the current president of Pitt’s Rainbow Alli-
ance, remarked on the “interesting history”
of thegroup at Pitt. ' f ‘-1 ' ’

“It was political for a while, and then be-
came a social group, which may havevbeen
great and needed support for students,” she
said. 9

The early BiGALA started out big by focus-
ing on awareness andadvocacy. In April 1991,
the group began informing students of ROTC

V policies, which hadvexcluded homosexuals

fromjoining ROTC ranks sincejanuary 1943.
The group frequently“crashed‘ROTC events,
handing out pamphlets and informationon

-the discriminatory’ policy.

But BiGALA retreated from its politically
active side in 1993, restructuring itself as a
support group under the guidance of co-Pres-
ident Stacy Winters. According to a Pitt News
interview from that same year explaining her
rationale, Winters reasoned that the advocacy
group had isolated an entire population ,——— a
population much like Dobson had described,

one that needed a support network rather
than a group continually ﬁling lawsuits and
rallies.

Adam Dobson, 2011-2012 vicepresident of
Rainbow Alliance, said in an email that these
groups began as educational spots doubling
as safe havens.

“It became apparent that if the average
gay man was going to be seeking others like
them in- this heteronormative world, a safe
place to do this was needed,” Dobson said.

' “The gay organization could be mobilized

as a place of community, a place of safer—sex
awareness and apolitical force.”

Branching out _ P

The 1993 academic year culminated in a
BiGALA prom in late April. Before that event,
one of the revised BiGALA’s ﬁrst programs was
a safer—sex workshop and an AIDS—awareness
booth co—sponsored by Campus Women’s Or-
ganization, a long-time ally of BiGALA.

f‘Feminism and LGBTQA rights have
been intertwined for a long time,” Dobson

explained, regarding the strong friendship _

between CWO and Rainbow Alliance.

“This is largely due to’ how feminism has
changed, going from women’s rights exclu—'
sively to an emphasis on recognizing all the

normative stuff of theworld. This includes

sexism and misogyny, but also heteronor-
mativity, racism, etc. It’s no surprise, then,
that we’ve always had people in Rainbow who
overlap with CWO membership,” he said.

Bella‘ Salamone; current president of 1

Campus Women’s Organization, agreed with

Dobson on the membership overlap, adding
in an email, “I think we keep it strong be-
cause our organizations are both interested
in gender and sexuality, ways of expressing
gender and sexuality and how people (in our
case, women) face discrimination or sham-
ing because of how they present themselves.
We want Pitt to be a safe space for people to

express themselves.”

Dougherty said the group began in 1998 to

' become even more inclusive, and that the col-

orfully renamed organization made it “clear
that folks outside of bisexual, gay and lesbian
are also included and welcome.”

As a result, the club is no longer exclusively
focused on issues facing the Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian members of campus, but has

. expanded to include explicitly the participa-

tion individuals who identify as queer — a
broader term that encompasses a wide range
of non-heteronormative sexual orientations
— as well as friends and allies. As such, the
group often holds events that reflect its more
inclusive nature with prggraming geared to-

ward sexuality as a whole and human justice.

Michael O’Brien, a freshman German
and Russian double major, is grateﬁil for the
group’s efforts. Frequently found in the Rain-
bow Alliance’s oﬂice, he views it as a place

to hang out and relax. The ofﬁce is a homey‘

nook in the William Pitt Union plastered with
bright photos and drawings and containing
an inviting couch and table. ‘

“The closest friends I have right now are
from Rainbow, rather than some of the other
student groups I’m in, due in to the fact
that Rainbow members are very welcoming

and friendly.”

The welcoming environment exists for a
reason. For Dougherty, providinga “safe space
to be comfortable” is a primary mission of the
group. For that reason, she and the other eight
board members hold ofﬁce hours, ranging
from ﬁve to six hours per week each. ,

Dobson agreed, admitting that the office
provided a haven for “people who have no—
where else to turn to.” '

In his time at Pitt, Dobson said he’s seen
people approach the group who have faced
sexual abuse, been kicked out of their homes,
been disowned, felt trapped in abusive rela-

. tionships and faced discrimination inclasses,

dorms or elsewhere at Pitt. He said that Rain-
bow Alliance has also provided information
for issues such as hormone treatment for trans
people, local LGBTQ organizations and coun-
seling services.

“There hasn’t been a good resource for
this practical and emotional support outside
of Rainbow,” Dobson said.

Multi-faceted goals

While Rainbow Alliance’s constitution cites
creating a positive environment for LGBTQ

. students, facilitating dialogue and aware-

ness between members and the University
and providing “unwavering support for the
transgendered and gender-variant commu-
nities” as key goals, another purpose of the

organization is to “provide education and

“It’s a mix,” Dougherty said. “We have two
events aweek: One is social‘ or supptlrt, and
the other is educational and political.”

The club has not taken the trajectory of
several of Pitt’s largest clubs in becoming a
Student Aﬁ'airs—aﬂ"Iliated group — a special
designation that allows a group to receive a
portion of funding from the Student Activities

. Fund through SGB—approved budgets. This is

for many reasons, according to Dougherty.
“We wanted to be able to advocate on is-
sues we thought were very important Being a

’ Rainbow Alliance has a lot on its plate for

coming up is Rainbow Alliance’s March 20
hosting ofjimmy Lasalvia, the co-founder and
executive director of GOProud, a political-ac-
tion organization representing gay conserva-

tives and alli_es. Other upcoming programming
will feature speakers who willtalk about social
justice and being openly out, notably includ-

” ing Brian Sims, a former NCAA quarterback‘
«who became the ﬁrst openly gay ‘member of

the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
Dougherty believes that activism and
support will always be “intertwined” in the
group’s mission. While Pitt’s group seems to
have evolved from focusing primarily on advo-
cacy to also stressingsupport and education,
Dougherty said many groups experience the
opposite progression. Either way, LGBTQ stu-
dent groups across the nation promote crucial

_ issues of support and advocacy in University

environments that can then spread beyond
campus limits.

“Most LGBT groups start as a safe place

for students, a place where they can feel com-
fortable talking and sharing their stories,”
Dougherty said. “Out of that space, then,
comes advocacy, wanting to make changes

' to make life better for students on campus,

as well aslocally and nationally.” I

A er another le 'slative stalemate between President Barack Obama ‘

A TASSER’S TAKE
Pirates must win for general

   
 

Catcher Russell Martin was the Pittsburgh Pirates’ big offseason signing. MCT Campus

Donnie Tasser
Staﬂ’ W riter

The crack of the bat, the smell of pine
tar and the sight of the Pittsburgh Pi-
rate's at the bottom of the standings can
only mean one thing: It’s spring. Even if
there is still snow outside and the Buccos
haven’t left spring training in Florida, the
season is already beginning to worry me.
And I shouldn’t be the only one fretting.

This is now year six of general man-
ager Neal Huntington’s regime, and al-
though the Pirates have made obvious
strides from the bumbling mess of has-
beens and never—weres of previoustyears,
he has yet to produce a winning ball club.

Even last season’s team —— on the
brink of the organization’s first Win-

uning season in more than two decades

before its second-straight momentous
late—season collapse —-— was more of an
overachiever than a contender. But Hun-
tington — at the behest of owner Bob
Nutting —— attempted to produce wins
with zero actual expense and ended up
destroying the team’s chemistry, its best
attribute.

He traded away veteran ﬁrst—baseman

manager Neal Huntington’s sake if

Casey McGehee and relief pitcher Brad
Lincoln for “project players,’-’ buying low

on players with perceived potential in "

the hopes that they undergo a rejuvena-
tion in Pittsburgh..Huntington’s time in
Pittsburgh has been characterized by
many of these moves“,,ojnly one ofwh’ich
has worked — veteran starting pitcher
A.J. Burnett. But the fun, stress—free club-
house atmosphere that the team veterans
crafted was destroyed by Huntington’s
trades at the deadline, and the team’s
performance mirrored that.

This offseason, instead of trying to

bolster the team witlilegitimate play— __ V

ers, Huntington signed several veterans,
including third—baseman Brandonjinge,
relief pitcher Joisei’1»Cbnt'reras andfdn1-
ity player Brad Hawpe to minor-league
deals. Even though these deals carry very
little risk, the reward is equally non-

, existent — none of these playershas

produced adecent season in years, and
they further add to the glut of “maybe
they will be good players” such as Gaby
Sanchez, Travis Snider andjerry Sands.

But hey, at least they got rid of Rod
Barajas. — A ~  ' ..

seasons. “It’s an added reminder to the
kids on a daily basis of what we’re striving
for — that last bit of perfection.”

' Pitt also strives for an ideal season, one
that meets the team’s larger goals of win-
ning the East Atlantic Gymnastics League
(EAGL) Championship and qualifying for
NCAA Regional Championships.

Veteran coaching

Petite in stature but towering in terms
of presence, Coach Yohman keeps the team
level. with her experience and authorita-
tive demeanor. _~

Because of class-schedule conﬂicts,
some girls warm up before practice ofﬁ—
cially starts and begin rehearsing their rou-j
tines, prompting subsequent cheers from
other teammates who have just witnessed
a smooth run—through on the uneven bars.

The majority of the 17-gymnast team
arrives to practice just before its sched—
uled start at 1:30 p.m. They enter beaming
with smiles, many in mid— conversation and

donning either a pink or navy Pitt shirt. '

Junior Brittney Harris runs to switch on a
black radio that sits on a stand in front of
a wall consisting of ﬁve panels of mirrors.

Before Harris can return.to the cluster of
gymnasts sitting patiently on the center

' mat, Coach Yohman yells out, “Brit, why

don’t you turn that down for a second,

‘ please.” Harris obliges. ’

Yohman, her sandy-blonde straight
hair falling just pastthe shoulders of her
navy blue Pitt track jacket, commands the
quieted room as she begins reviewing the
itinerary for an upcoming weekend meet.

“My coaches have helped in-
still in me that hard work pays
off and I can do anythingl set my
mind to,” said Alyssa A-dri-
an, the team’s only senior.
“Through all the injuries,
pain and obstacles I have
encountered over the past
four years, [the coaches] kept
pushing me.”

Fighting through injuries I

That the EAGL’s Rookie of
the Year award has been handed
out to a Pitt gymnast three times
since 2009 should provide tan-
gible evidence of Yohman’s tu-
telage. Last year, sophomore
Haley Bodenheimer took home

i l’ the honor. Unfortunately for the

Panthers, an elbow injury kept
Bodenheimer from participat-
ing in this season.

’ The 2012 EAGL Rookie of
the Year is just one of many in-
jured gymnasts on Pitt’s roster.
But just like a gymnast’s knees
on the best of dismounts, the
Panthers are only slightly bent,
proving they are nowhere near
breaking.

In its second meet this season,
the team recorded the sixth-high-
est score in school history with a
total of 195.625.

cus in the gym led us to that
score,” Yohman said of the
conﬁdent home performance
that resulted in Pitt’s highest
score since 2004.
The attitude of a winning team
— especially one with the talent
to perform at a level compa-
rable to any other since the
beginning of the school’s
program in 1975 — is.

poise to recognize that a

uplifting of spirits
during practices

that is the reason why Harris and
others slide mats underneath an
airborne teammate practicing an
uneven bar routine. Or why assis-
tant coach Mike Rowe pushes —
sometimes literally, should she be
slipping —— a gymnast for her best
effort, and lets out an “Oh, yeah!”
with a corresponding high-ﬁve
when that upper limit is achieved.
Or even why sophomore Bri Ho-

When they ﬁnish [lifting], they go do ab

One Team, One Dream, One Heartbeat

Even the injured gymnasts —— all four of
them — stick together.

“Our workouts are modiﬁed because of
injuries, but we’re usually in here togeth-

missed this season because of torn anterior

cruciate and medial collateral ligaments, as
well as torn medial and lateral hamstrings.

Even if injuries kept the younger gym-
nasts out of the lineups at meets, a torn liga-
ment never prevented them from feeling like
members of the Pitt gymnastics team.

Just before coming to Oakland this sum~
mer, freshmanjacqueline Lucci tweaked her
elbow. She then sprained an ankle and, as
a result, limps around the Fitzgerald Field
House on crutches. Fellow sidelined fresh-
man Maebelle Pacheco came to Lucci’s aid,
though, to hold up her right arm and show
off a blue bracelet. The yellow letters spell
out the message “One Team, One Dream,”
while the reverse side reads “One Heartbeat.”

or if someone is struggling,” freshman Ellie
Pikula, who has been sidelined since De-
cember because of a badly tracking patella,
said about how the messages reﬂect Pitt
gymnastics. A

Adrian, who missed her freshman year
because of injuries, is simply passing the
torch by providing positive reinforcement.

“Since we had eight new freshmen, it was
important to bond together as a team early
in the weeks leading up to the start of pre-
season,” she said. “Team chemistry is one
area we wanted to improve this year.”

Before the season began, the Panthers
participated in Color Me Rad,'an event that
brought the whole team together.

Color Me Rad is a “5K of color bombard-
ment,” its site says. Throughout the race,
runners are drenched in powder of all col-
ors. At the ﬁnish line, the Color Me Rad site
explains, “Hugs are free and spectators are
welcome.”

“Color Me Rad was the perfect activity to
kick off the season,” Adrian said.

That camaraderie appeared to carry into
the season, helping the Panthers overcome
injury woes and adversity.

With two meets left — at home in the
Fitzgerald Field House against Michigan
State on Friday, March 8, at 7 p.m. and ver-
sus Auburn on Saturday, March 16, at 7 p.m.
—— the Pitt gymnastics team just needs to
stick its landing to ﬁnish a fantastic season.

The Panthers posted their third-best team
score in school history against North
Carolina this year. Courtesy Pitt Athletics
