Merchants File Claims L

For Blasting Damage

BY MREA CSORBA

Two Forbes Avenue busines-
ses. The Athletes Foot and
University Travel Services, are
ﬁling insurance claims against the
Joseph Graciano Corp., the com-
pany hired ‘by the University to
sandblast the exterior of Schenley
Quadrangle buildings, for alleged
damages ensuing from the cleaning
job.

Water and sand grit allegedly
leaked inside an Athletes Foot
display window and caused dam-
age to suede shoes and other
display items.

Store -manager Frances Lilli said
that because the restoration com-
pany failed to notify them as to the
speciﬁc»-date the sandblasting
wouldstart, Athletes Foot did not
pull the display merchandise from
the windows. Retribution for rug
shampooing and daily window
washings also is needed. Lilli said.

John Bohna of University Travel
Services said his agency wants
compensation for a torn awning,
the dry-cleaning soiled drapes and
for the services of a company hired
to wash sand grit from the office
interior.

Other stores along Forbes
Avenue suffered minor inconven-
iences but are not ﬁling claims.

“Sand leaks through air holes
are unavoidable even with the
windows taped and covered with

plastic, as those stores were,"
foreman Joe Stewart of the
Graciano Corp. said. “You can still
find sand inside the windows of the
Union Trust Building downtown
that we restored years ago."

Hunt Martin. Pitt's physical
plant director, said the job had to
be done for the structural security
Jfthe building. “The stones were
in dire need of being pointed-
patching up the surface cracks and
repairing the ioints.

"Cracks which put stress on the
strcture also accumulate water
causing the stone to expand and
contract with weather changes."
Martin said. “We can't find the
potentially dangerous stone rifts
until the encrustment of dirt and
pollution has been stripped away."

Sandblasting scours building
surfaces by shooting sand under
high pressure which removes the
outer 1/64-inch layer of crystal-
lized chemical particles. Such acid
deposits are harmful, also, because
they eat away at the stone. Once
the accumulated acids are remov-
ed, the cracks are revealed and can
be sealed with mortar, Martin said.

The sandblasting will continue
the rest of this week on Forbes
aVenue and then workers will
begin a two-week restoration job on
the Fifth Avenue side.

STUDENT SYSTEM

The Student Health Consumer
Board is examining complaints
about the newly instituted student
health fee.

The ll-member student board
has received numerous charges of
the fees duplication of coverage
under insurance programs.

The fee plan. in which all
full-tinie students pay $16 per term
for health coverage. will be
effective fall term.

Co~chairperson Russ Vogel said
the fee was not intended to replace
hospitalization insurance.

Its value lies in coverage of
services not normally carried in
standard health insurance pro-
grams. he stressed.

"There may be legitimate
exceptions to those who pay the
fee." Vogel admitted, “But the
board can't push for them this fall.
because. to do so might jeopardize
the funding base of the student
Health Service."

Vogel said the Health Service
must demonstrate it can achieve a
sound ﬁnancial position before a
rcdeterniination of student popula-
tions to be used in levying the fee
can be made.

Cop Report Termed Lacking

(Continued from Page I)

The important issue. Guy said.
was that “in the line of duty.
ofﬁcers were harrassing individu-
als. But I don't really think the
recommendations that are in the ad
hoe committee report are going to
be that effective."

The task force. created in May.
recommended the appointment of a
community relations unit within the
security force that campus police
jurisdiction be confined to Univer-
sity-owned property and that
ofﬁcers summon city police. when
practicable. for incidents that occur
off-canipus.

In addition. the task force report
calls for “consideration of the
eventual phasing-out of present
‘police-type’ uniforms except for an

number and for a new complaint

TEAM STUDYING QUASARS

A team of astronomers which
includes Arthur M. Wolfe. an
assistant professor of physics and
astronomy at Pitt. has “strong

Quasars look like stars and emit

extremely strong radio waves
believed to generate tremendous
amounts of energy

Pitt Student Is Carter Whip

When delegates at the Demo-
cratic convention are asked to
nominate Jimmy Carter by accla-
mation tonight, one of those voices
you'll hear screaming “Yea" will
belong to Joe Adamczyk.

Adamczyk. a P.H. history major.
got to New York by election via
Carter. He was an early supporter
of the former Georgia governor.
and says he is glad to see his fellow
Democrats in the Carter fold.

“There's a sense of purpose
that's almost a lust for the White
House.

"There are still Udall and Brown
supporters who don't like Carter."
he added. “but everyone seems to

be determined to have the White
House."

Adamczyk said he saw other
examples of unity in Madison
Square Garden. Delegates spent
I0 minutes standing and applaud-
ing Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas
after her keynote address Monday.
and Adamczyk said it was “a
moving sight to see middle-class
WASPs from Pennsylvania cheer-

ing a black from Texas."

cludes. among others. students

man William Keefe.

Adamczyk has the added re-

Pennsylvania's Carter delegation.

Security was tight at the
convention. if Adamc2yk's ex-
periences are any barometer. He
said his credentials were checked

Credentials were apparently as

As far as addressing charges that
blacks have allegedly been arrested
or harrassed consistently by some
officers. the report states: “If it
appears that too high a number of
arrests or complaints seem'to arise
when given ofﬁcers are assigned to
particular locations. a careful
guideline should be developed for
shifting and redeployment of those
officers."

The report states that for the
period of December 1975 through
May 26. I976, 418 arrests were
made by the campus police. Of
those arrests. blacks accounted for
295. or 70.7%. A total of 116
arrested persons were released or
chages dismissed after arrest.

“This may suggest that there
was no cause for the arrest. since
apparently there was no basis for

Powers said he feels the group
attained a settlement beneﬁcial to
all institutions involved.

“La Roche now hopes Pitt
students taking courses at the
North Hills extension also will be
tempted to take courses at La
Roche, since many of Pitt's night
classes will be taught at the La

Powers said Pitt has been trying
to establish a North Hills extension
for three years. Presently. South

detain ment of the arrestees beyond
the initial hearing." the‘ report
says.

Barbara K. Shore. chairman of
the task force and a Pitt professor
of social work. said arrest records
do not show reasons why charges
were dropped against some of
those persons arrested.

Both Guy and Sanford said the
community committee that lodged
the complaints in May. which
included the NAACP. the Ameri-
can Friend Service Committee. the
Black Catholic Ministries and
concerned citizens. probably will
draft a report of their own.

Guy added the complaint proce-

dure recommended by the task
force was adequately covered by
the p‘s report. The complaint
procedure includes a standardized
complaint form to be ﬁled with the
campus police chief. a monitoring
committee to review the complaints
and an appeals committee to
review decisions. The ﬁnal line of
appeal should be the Chancellor's
office. the report states.

Shore said she felt the task force
report is “an adequate beginning
of a process that should be formally
followed through the year."

Shore said the task force had
been charged to look at campus
security and make recommendati-
ons about policies and procedures
within the police force.

. “The charge was not to be an
investigative committee of speciﬁc
charges." Shore said. “I think
reaction to the report is going to be
very mixed. as there were mixed
reactions to the problems."

Student Government president
Barry Weisband. also a member of

' the task force. said he thought the

report was fair in that it looked at
the security force as a whole and
did not “become a witch hunt" for
individual ofﬁcers.

"We expect and hope ongoing
committees would look into speciﬁc
problems we have cited in the
report," Wcisband said. Both he
and shore added the task force was
limited by the June 30 deadline
imposed on them. The group
worked for six weeks,

Under “Training,” the report recommends: “Officers should have
practice in how to avoid arrests by quelling troublesome situations
before they escalate into negative interactions of a threatening sort
between the oﬂicers and the person or persons involved.’ ’ Behind the
big words, the sentence says in essence that officers shouldn’t make a
bad situation worse. That is common sense, and common training for
officers of all police forces.

Answering charges of racial bias by ofﬁcers, the report states: “If it
appears that too high a number of arrests or complaints seem to arise

when given oﬂicer are assigned to particular locations, a careful
guideline should be developed for shifting and redeployment of these

officers.”  in other words, if an officer arrests too many persons in
one spot, move him.

Stronger tactics than that are required.

Analyzing the data on black arrests, the report shows that in an
approximate six-month period, there were 418 arrests. Blacks
accounted for 295% of those arrested, or 70.7%.

A total of 116 arrested persons were later released or had their

charges dismissed after arrest. Ninety-six of that number were black,
while 20 were white. The report, says: “This may suggest that there
was no cause for arrest, since apparently there was no basis for
detaimnent of the arrestees beyond the initial hearing.”

That isn't saying much. The data is signiﬁcant, and makes a strong

case for bias. But the report fails to do much with the data but state
the painfully obvious.

One of the few real “innovations” offered by the task force is a

change in the color and style of campus police uniforms.

Six weeks ago the Chancellor decided it was about time something

was done about campus security problems. It is still about time.

Russ Arnold

“Government relations director” may have been a misnomer for
Russ Amold’s position at Pitt. .

He was more of a student liaison in matters emanating from the
state capitol. _ .

Arnold died Sunday. We will miss his ready deciphering of budget
bills and scholarship funds, his willingness to explain how a student
could get through to his legislator.

Arnold was accessible, one of few Pitt administrators who saw his.
job in the context of student cares.

Dan Meloro

It is unfortunate that Student Activities Director Dan Meloro must
leave. =
He has served well in his position, and his first floor Student Union

office has gained a reputation among student leaders for honesty. and
straightforwardness. Relatively few students at Pitt ever have direct

encounters with administrators, but all are affected by their decisions
down the line. The decisions made by Meloro’s office, and the actions
he has taken, have been both intelligent and fair.

As the nine-member screening committee searches for a
replacement, they should strive to ﬁnd a candidate with an irmovative
mind, and administrative skills to see the innovations implemented. .

Pitt's student activities—-including student organizations, services,
and events—are plentiful, and for the most par. quality. But, as
always, there is room for improvement. '

“AiBarbara Jordan” Speaks

BY BILL MOORE

This column is about the
Democratic National Convention.
Asleep yet?

Granted. there isn't much
excitement in the topic. David
Brinkley and Walter Cronkite are
trying. but it is a downhill fight.

The only point in the conventi-
on's opening night that spurred
even the slightest interest was a
keynote address by Barbara Jor-
dan.

Jordan. the Texas Congresswo-
man who first gained national
proininence as a member of the
House Judiciary Committee during
the 1974 impeachment hearings. is
the first woman and first black to
be elected to congress from Texas,
and one of the first black women
elected to congress from anywhere.

She has a reputation as an
eloquent speaker. and Monday
evening was no exception.

“One hundred and forty years
ago." she began. “members of the
Democratic Party met for the first
time in convention to select their
presidential candidate. Since that
time. Democrats have continued to
convene once every four years to
draft a party platform and
nominate a presidential candidate.

Our meeting this week continues
that tradition.

"'l'herc‘ is something different
and special about this opening
night. I. Barbara Jordan. am a
keynote speaker."

Indeed she was. And indeed it
was something different.

It would be easy to dismiss
Barbara Jordan as another in a long
line of tokens. The Democrats
were killing two birds with one
stonc——a black and a woman token.
She could be dismissed as a token.
except for two things.

The first is the reception she
received. It was Monday's only
floor demonstration, and a surprise
to most evervone.

But second. and more important.
was what Jordan said. Tokens do
not speak the way Jordan does. nor
do people listen so intently.

The usual mindless hacks still
murmured and shuffled through
aisles during Jordan's speech. but
most of the concerned delegates
listened for the first time all night.

“Many fear the futures uncer-
tainly. are distrustful of ‘their

leaders. and believe that their
voices are not heard. Many seek
only to satisfy their private dreams.

They ignore the common interest
-the common good.

"This is the great danger that .

America faces. that we will cease to
be one nation and become instead a
collection of interest groups. each
seeking to fulllill private dreams.
Each seeking to fulfill private
wants."

'l'lic thoughts have been expres-
scd before. but seldom so
eloquently. Jordan minces no
words. She digs into a complex
problem and pulls out the core.
Others have done the same. but not
at a Democratic National Conven-
lltin.

There is sigiiiftciiiice to the fact it
took a black woman to tell the white
male world of politics what people
are afraid of. Barbara Jordan is
a politician whose time has come,
and though Jiminy Carter is very
unlikely to choose her as a running
mate. the candidate after him ina_v.
Or at least the one after that.

The next few years will be
interesting.

A Different

View Of
Philadelphia

On July 7 the Pitt News
published a piece of anti-journa-
lism intended to defame the July
4th Coalition demonstration in
Philadelphia. lt seems‘ that the
philosophy of journalism held by
Cris Hall. who wrote the immature
and melodramatic opinion, is that
any lie. confusion. distortion or
vagueness is permissible in writing
that is clearly labeled as opinion.
The development of this nihilistic
philosophy is understandable, as
people are now taught by the power
of objective institutions in America
to hold personally arrived at
opinions as worthless. merely
subjective epiphenomena to which
the criterion of responsibility is
irrcvelant. “That's just your
opinion“ and “but that's a value
judgment" and more discussions
among the educated than do any
other put-down‘s.

But newspaper writers ought to
struggle against the premise that
opinions aren't accountable to any
standards of perception. reason, or
language usage. When, on the
contrary. they do indulge them-
selves by wrting any unsubstan-
tiated fantasy that pleases their
needs. a responsible copy editor

‘ should check out their assertions.

Unfortunately for the Pitt commun-
ity. the writer of the attack on the
July 4th Coalition is the Pitt News
copy editor. Readers who depend
on the University student new-
paper should consider the implica-
tions of Cris Hall's irresponsibility.

On his way to giving is opinion.
Hall claimed that we expected
200.000 demonstrators. thus con-
fusing us with the Washington
PBC. and claimed that we had a
press agent who inflated the
number of people who actually
were in Fairmount Park. One
individual. who was in no way our
ollicial spokesperson. said through
the microphone to the crowd that
we were 58.00()——whereupon other
demonstrators immediately chal-
lenged that number. We hoped for
:~0.()00 participants and by our
count we were about 30.000. Cris
Hall's tactic is to find one person

1 ing violence.

saying or doing what he wants to
use. and treat that as representa-
tive no matter ow unrepresentative
it is.

While it is true that no one knew.
in the Platonic sense of "know."
what to expect in Philadelphia. We
did not travel there. as Cris Hall
confesses to having done, expect-
Those who were
responsible for organizing the
demonstration brought medical
kits. but we did not alarm one
another about the possibility of
violence. We were wearing
sandals. not combat boots. A letter
to people who'd bought bus tickets
did advise us not to wear contact
lenses. That was in the context of
general precautions for comfort.
others being to avoid sunburn and
take a canteen. The mention of a
possible tear-gas attack was Hall's
()\\'il.

lhcre was no "violence between
dilleent groups of demonstrators"
as Hall asserts. Everyone we know

had with people we met. We heard

allcd violent. And “internal
security force" is certainly an
iiiappropriate term to use for our
parade marshals. who were neither
autliorized nor equipped to "put

dmm" anyone any way but
verbally.
Hall claims that because the

citizens of North Philadelphia took
pictures of our march. he can state
that they regarded it as a circus
parade. This is ridiculous: not
every parade is a circus parade,
’ iy more than every speaker is a

costumes made the political mes-
sage of our parade more colorful.
All along our march we felt
friendliness from the people who
sat in front of their houses to watch
us; we exchanged salutes. and saw
only two American flags, neither
one as large as the red. black and
green flag on one fam'tly's porch. If
Hall had taken a leaflet from the
Crispus Attucks brigade, he could
not have written that “the poor of

Wallace as he protests that his
Constitutional right to a fair trial
has been denied. An honest person
wotild have written that the import
ol the speech and the mimeograph
that was handed out is that Stanton
Story was in North Carolina when
l’atrick Wallace was shot in
Pittsburgh. and that Story was
denied at his trial the opportunity
to prove that.

Cris Hall shows throughout his
story that he is incapable of making
the distinctions that mature reason
requires. He obliviates the

distinction between the Coalition's’-

open appeal for money——we paid
lor our own demonstration—and
corporation executives’ expendi-
tures on bribes of money approp-
riated through dishonest account-
ing practices. He doesn’t even

recognize the distinction between
the confusions of his own miknd
and alleged contradictions in the
speeches he heard.

Hall didn't discover anything in
Philadelphia. He didn't see or hear

aiiytliiiig but his own disgust with
political dissent. It seems that he
didn't discuss his impressions with
aiiyoiie who would have tried to
correct them before they were
printed. The Pitt News needs a
copy editor.

Taking the
1776 Ideals

Seriously

I wasn't in Philadelphia on July
4. but I don't think it takes an
eyewitness to refute some of the
silly statements in Cris Hall's
column on the subject.

difference. as Mark Twain might
liayc said. is between the lighting
and the lightning bug. I wotild have
tliotiglit that a college edllcillloll
would teach students something
about orders of magnitude and
what they mean.

Perhaps it looks a little paranoid
to restrict photographers to distan-
ces greater than thirty feet. It
would look that way, as long as you
forget the massive spying atid
pryitig operations the government
has conducted on citizens suspect-
ed of holding the wrong political
views. Or didn't Hall know tht Paul

say that the prosecution played a
little loosely with the rules of
evidence at the trial. And if so. it
certainly wouldn't be the first time
an innocent person was convicted
for a crime someone else of the
same color had committed.

The niisfits are not those who
take the ideals of 1776 seriously.
The real niisﬁts are_ people like
Hall. in whom the two hundredth

can arouse no thought or emotion

Soaring Spaceship Concert

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

The Jefferson Starship may not
be as American as apple pie, but,
based on their performance last
Saturday night at the Civic Arena,
they may be the ﬁnest band in the
United States.

The Starship's core members,
Paul Kantner (rhythm guitar/vo-
cals), Grace Slick (vocals) and
Marty Balin (vocals/congas), are
former members of San Francisco's
most famous 1960s acid-protest
rock group, the Jefferson Airplane.
Their mature stage presence and
beautifully intertwining vocal har-
monies ‘were inspiring throughout
the evening, effortlessly captivat-
ing the Arena crowd.

The band opened loud and hard
with “Ride the Tiger," “Fast Buck
Freddie," “Hot Water" and “St.
Charles," immediately asserting
their new identity.

Most of the songs performed
were taken from the last three
Starship albums, Dragonﬂy, Red
Octopus and Spitﬁre.

Kantner’s love of the Orient,
science ﬁction and outer space was
displayed on “Dance with the
Dragon.” “Have You Seen The
Saucers" and “Song to The Sun.”
His vocals, although cold and
nasal, were strangely effective.

Slick is a complete loon, and with
the shedding of 30 excess pounds,
reigns again as a visually dynamic
stage ﬁgure. She provided gutsy
vocals on “Play on Love,"

“Sweeter than Honey." “Some-
body to Love" and one of the
encore tunes, the 605 drug song
“White Rabbit.”

But overlooking her vocal attri-
butes, old Grace sure knows how to
get an audience going. When she
told’ the audience to “go down on
the guy next to you," and began
snapping pictures of band mem-

On “Cruisin." “There Will Be
Love" and two of the encore
numbers. the hit single “Miracles"
and the rousing “Volunteers" jam,
he displayed a moody vocal style
that absorbed the audience.

As l said before. this is the
Starship, not the Airplane. The
drug-inspired stage performances

The Jefferson Starship ‘family portrait’.

bers and audience from a camera
heaved onstage. she ‘had the crowd
eating out of her hand.

Balin has been with the Starship
for just two albums, but their
soaring commercial success has
come since his return to the band.
He was relatively inactive for the
first half of the show, but really
turned it on toward the end.

Bluegrass Filled With

Energy and Desire

BY NORM MARTELLO

Country Cooking with the
Fiction Brothers, Flying Fish, 019.
“Pd like to be a small part of
life/ with some few things to

achieve.”

—Don stover, “Things in Life”

Some music will make you feel
sorry for yourself. Some music will
bring lonely memories to uselessly
batter your spirit. Some music will
fool you into thinking that the devil
has control of the world.

The latest release from Country
Cooking, a young bluegrass band,
recognizes loneliness, bad times
and injustice. Still, the music is
ﬁlled with optimixm and feeds off
this energy, like it tree drinks in the
bounty of the soil. It’s a strong
album and will lift your sagging
spirits in lonely times, but without
removing the loneliness. Only you
can do that.

“I guess I never knew what it
meant for me to go/I guess you
never know what lies in store”—
Howie Tarnower’s “Califomia
Song”

Some of the best new music is
clear-headed, strength-inducing
and eclectic. It takes the music of
old and adds the modem to it-—for
example, the electric blues made

new during the 19605 the tradition
of folk-song writing.

This music introduces aspects of
our own modern culture mingled
with those of our predecessors. It
may combine genres of music, such
as a fusion of jazz and bluegrass
Tony Trishka’s Light Bluegrass
into a music exciting to the
technical musician and a joy for the
listener. One label whose
recordings have fostered the new
and kept alive the old is Philo.
Another is Flying Fish.

Based in Chicago, Flying Fish is
a small label connected with
Boston's Rounder Collective, a
group that has been issuing new
recordings of country, bluegrass,
blues and‘ mountain music. -
Rounder has also been a distributor
for many small labels dispensing
music such as West African kora
music. calypso. reggae, Kenneth
Patchen's poetry and the Canter-
bury Country Dance Orchestra.

Flying Fish Records has released
its fair share of “new" music,
including duets and solos by
boogie-woogie piano players
Jimmy Walker and Erwin Helfer,
“Hillbilly Jazz" with David Brom-
berg and Vassar Clements, as well
as John Hartford's latest. “Mark

Summer Chuckles

Disappointingly Tired

BY M. C. PILECKI

Now it’s time for summer
chuckles: comedies, alleged
comedies and movies that are so
bad they’re laughable.

A couple of movies have been
put forth by established comed-
ians, and both have to be counted
as disappointments. Mel Brooks’
Silent Movie and Neil Simon's
Murder By Death both start
strong, have good premises, but
fall short in the follow-through.

The former is just what it says it
is—silent; that is without spoken
dialogue but with music and sound
effects. The plot—what little there
is—concerns the present-day ef-
forts of a washed-up movie
director, Mel Funn (Brooks), to
make a silent movie and save the
studio from the clutches of Engulf
and Devour, an evil conglomerate.

So far so good, and as far as
Movie goes, it's not all that bad.
-There are some brilliant scenes;
Anne'Bancroft (Mrs. Brooks in real
life) muggingwith Marty’Feldman,
who would ﬁnd it hard not to get
laughs no matter what he did; an
unlikely chase scene with Paul
Newman; a sick (depending on
your taste) bit of business with the
dying studio chief (Sid Caesar); and
the delivery of the one spoken
word.

The trouble is, the movie is
spotty. For every terriﬁc bit,
there's at least one very tired joke,
another of such questionable taste
it's difﬁcult to elicit a laugh, and
one that just simply falls ﬂat. Plus,
Brooks didn't exploit his material
far enough———not even to the point
of jazzing up his titles, a mainstay
of the original silent comedies.
After seeing what Brooks did in
earlier movies. Silent Movie is a
real comedown.

So is Murder By Death, Neil
Simon's attempt to be more like
Mel Brooks. Gone are the usual
slick urbanity and the one-liners.
Murder is a boffo farce, ﬁlled with
the "bathroom jokes” one expects
from Brooks and fantastic take-offs
of established characters.

ln this case, the characters are
the “world's greatest detectives,"
a collection of ﬁve famous ﬁctional
detectives whose names are slight-

ly changed. They are invited by a \

eccentric millionaire (Truman
Capote—an excellent choice for the
role) to a very suspicious-looking
house to solve a murder not yet
committed.

Part of the problem with Murder
is that it is in no way a murder
mystery, but rather a spoof of
murder mysteries. Attempting to
follow the plot (as one does with
mysteries) will lead one entirely
‘away from the comedy—what there
is of it.

In this respect. Murder just

doesn't make it. The charactrf ”~""

once their own little foibles-7%-.=.e
milked for laughs, become

collection of very dull people. A . S
of business '

the fantastic bits

The game was televised nationally
by ABC. while CBS and NBC
televised the Democratic National
Convention from New York.

The victory was the fifth straight
for the National Leaguers and their
13th in the last 14 years. The
National League leads 28-18-1 in
the series that began in 1933.

All-American Panther halfback Tony Dorsett and his teammates
could be looking forward to a national championship, according to two
leading pre-season publications. GamePlan magazine says Dorsett is
“the best running back in the nation this year,” and a member of the
“best rushing backﬁeld in the land.” Both GamePlan and Street and
Smith's college football yearbook predict Pitt will be one of the best

  

teams in the country this year.

GamePlan’s predictions are
made on the basis of a selection
system which rates separately a
team's offensive and defensive
capabilities. Pitt's attack is tied
with those of Michigan and
Nebraska as the national's best.

Panther Footballers--
  Don't Throw Stones!

BY TOM HALL

It is unfortunate. perhaps even disgraceful.

But the question of just exactly whom is to blame is a matter of
ethics. So the debate rages on.

One Monday. November 17. 1975, my parents returned from a
business venture to Chicago. My father brought me a copy of the
Sunday edition of the Chicago Sun Times.

“That was a helluva game Saturday, wasn’t it?” he questioned,
referring to Pitt’s 34-20 win over Notre Dame. “Look at this,” he said,
pointing to the Sun Times article on the game. There was even a
picture of Tony Dorsett. In the Chicago Sun Times!

“This is it,” he said, “big time football returns to Pitt.’’

1 went on to read the article. praising Dorsett in every manner
conceivable. But the story didn't stop with coverage of the game. It
even portrayed the post-game celebration.

Blow by blow.

Entitled “Good News, Bad News from Pittsburgh,” the story went
on to describe that rather eventful confrontation between Robert
Carey, a Langhorne, Pa. resident, and three Panther football players
outside the Wooden Keg later that evening.

Tom Perko, Dave Treiber and John Pelusi were later arraigned on "

charges of aggravated assault. The case was later dismissed.

But the story doesn't stop there.
players keeps growing. '

The list of malcontent football

Add to that list all-East candidate linebacker Arnie Weatherington.
On Friday, July 2, Weatherington voluntarily turned himself in to city
city police after a warrant had been issued for his arrest on charges of
theft and receiving stolen property.

And a few months ago, linebacker Al Chesley was charged with
breaking into a vehicle parked in the Towers garage, and attempting to
heist an auto tape player. .

This list could continue, but I won’t stretch the point in this column.

Getting back to the incident involving Treiber, Pelusi and Perko, the
team’s defense attorney, Samuel Sciullo, said before the trial that “the
charges were blown out of proportion.” Following their acquittal, the
presiding judge agreed with Sciullo’s assessment of the situation when

he said. “if these young men were not football players, this case would
never have come this far.” '

If indeed the charges were blown out of proportion. then the

question arises, just whom is out to get a majority of the Panther
football team behind bars?

Certainly, as in the case mentioned above, and as in the case of
Arnie Weatherington, these situations are receiving undue publicity. 4
These guys are getting second and third-page stories in the city’s
major newspapers. If you or I had committed an aggravated assault, or
allegedly stolen $699 worth of stereo equipment, would we make the
Pittsburgh Press? Would our names be much more than just a listing
under the daily city crim report?t‘

Perhaps the fault lies with the media. But news _is news. and reading
about Panther football players being arrested makes interesting
reading.

There is an old saying—“People who live in glass houses shouldn't
throw stones." "

The Pitt football team should take heed to such old sayings. It has
become evident that any misconduct will be picked up by the media.
When Tony Dorsett accumulates a bunch of parking citations, it
becomes a front page story in the Pittsburgh Press, or an added feature
at the end of the 11:00 news. '

It is unfortunate the wayward trodding of few must reflect on the
whole. 1 would go so far as to expect that the only time the “other 95%
of the Pitt football team’s members might have a run-in with the city
police is when the officers might be looking for autographs for their
kids after the game. i v

“I understand your football team is a bunch of convicts," a friend of
mine from another university asked me the other day. It is becoming
an extremely uncomfortable situation when the Chicago Sun Times
sees fit to run the Pitt football “Crime Report.”

Starship
‘Concert
Soars ‘

(Continued from Page 6)
Kaukonen, but much more melod-
ic; and perfect for the smoother
brand of hard rock the Starship is
now performing. Rotating bass
and keyboardmen Pete Sears and
David Freiberg have given the
Starship an electrified, spacey
sound with their tasty mellotron

ﬁlls and fast-ﬁngered bass work. -

Drummer Johnny Barbata accented
every song perfectly with his
powerful and versatile stickwork.

The Starship is America’s band
of the future. They are more
serious and relevant than the
surﬁng gospel of the Beach Boys
and the desert tales of the Eagles
and more realistic in light of the
pouty rock-star poses of younger
bands like Kiss and-Aerosmith.

Protest songs have taken a back
seat to love ballads and rocking
sci-ﬁ tunes with Oriental leanings,
but when the Starship ends the
show with “Volunteer,” damned if
you don't feel like getting up to join
in and shout for change.

The ’60s Airplane has turned
into a '70s Starship, and is ﬂying
higher than ever.

Ex-Sha Na Na lead guitarist
Henry Gross was placed in the
unenviable position of opening for
the Starship. A goofy-looking cross
between Rod Price of Foghat and
Donavanl, he performed a set of
solid hard rock (“Plug Me Into
Something"), and slower blues
ballads (“Simone," “Shannon”).
Gross is a fast and fluid guitarist
with a unique whining vocal style,
but his stage show lacked direction.
When he ﬁnds it, expect bigger

and better things from him.

FULLERTON, CALIF. (AP)-
A shocked university community
grieved for its dead, unable to
concentrate on exams Tuesday in
the aftermath of the slaying of
seven college employes in a school
library.

“Everybody seems to be walking
around in a state of shock," said C.
H. Jones, 23, a student at
California State. Fullerton, where
the shootings occurred. “No one's
going to classes...it's too hard to
concentrate.“

Allaway, 37. alleging that he
gunned down nine persons Mon-
day—-seven were killed and two
seriously wounded———in a library on

worked as a custodian.

"He had a problem," said one of
Al|away's fellow workers. “He
told me he had a family problem
and the last two days he worked, he
was awful hard to get along with.”

Police said they had been unable
to determine a motive for the mass
slaying. But witnesses to the
shooting say the defendant

screamed out references to his 
estranged wife as he opened ﬁre.  

Meanwhile. the flags ﬂew at half
