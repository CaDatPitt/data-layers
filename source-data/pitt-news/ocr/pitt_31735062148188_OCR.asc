ODK Chisels

Honor Seniors

0. Willy Diggs to Trace
Ancestry from Ninth

Did you ever hear of anyone chis-
elling an ODK key?

Well, that’s exactly what workmen
are doing on the much-talked-of
Senior Walk, which honors the out-
standing senior of each year’s grad-
uating class.

The engraving of the Omicron
Delta Kappa key, symbol of the na-
tional honorary activities fraternity
for upperclassmen, on the ﬂagstones
completes the work. With the key is
the inscription: “On this walk Omi-
crom Delta Kappa honors those per-
sons who, through intelligent leader-
ship, personal integrity, and intellect-
ual honesty, have served their Uni-
versity well.” _

The names of the outstanding hon-
ored have already been incised in the
border stones of the walk, beginning
at the Cathedral end of the North
Belleﬁeld walk.

If you are one of those strange
people who always counts steps or
telephone poles you’ll be glad to know.
that the last name will be chiseled
somewhere around. 2147 A. D.,‘ al-
lowingone stone for each year. The
walk will last about 208 years.

It means, assuming you are a male,
that when you are a senior, you’ll
have about one chance in 850 of hav-
ing dirt ground into your incisions.
There are about 850 men graduated
from the University each year.
four-hundred—odd women around are
not being chiseled yet.

The names are inscribed near the
tops of the blocks, so that there will
be plenty of space for some out-
standing descendant of yours in the
ninth generation hence to have the

stone that you occupied in 1940.
Besides, think of the fun they’ll
have tracing back their brainy an-
_cestry. Q. Willy Diggs, College
2139, will state no doubt, in an ex-
clusive interview: “My great—great-
great—great-great-great grandfather
was so bright and so outstanding he
was put on a slab when he ﬁnished
Pitt——-they chiseled him there.”

Whodunit?

Faculty Relaxes
With Detective Fiction

What do University professors do
to rest their weary brain cells?

They read detective stories for one
thing, according to Mrs. Helen H.
Downs, leading librarian whose fig-
ures on circulation reveal that pro-
fessors are among the most consistent
borrowers of detective stories. Many
students, the ﬁgures also reveal, are
readers of the “whodounit” thrillers.
C At present the great demand for
the detective story makes it the most
popular form of recreational reading
in the library.

Three favorite sleuths of faculty
readers are Nero Wolfe, Mr. Moto,
and Father Brown. The three favor-
ite authors are Dorothy Sayers, E.
Phillips Oppenheim, and Agatha
Christie.

British, Western Reserve Meets

Oxford Debate Squad
Loses Titled Colleague
In Call to Battle Front

Instead of crossing the Atlantic
ocean to participate in the interna-
tional debate between Oxford and
the University, the Honorable Hugh
Fraser, son of Baron Lovett, has
crossed the English channel to join
the Allied forces, according to offi-
cers of Men’s Debating Association.

The Honorable Mr. Fraser had
planned to debate in Foster Memorial
on November 8, at 8:15 o’clock. He
was ordered, however, by the British
war department to proceed immedi-
ately to a position in the Maginot
line.

In order that speaker of equal abil-
ity might be substituted, the British

war office recalled from France Peter

Street, who had been in line of duty
on the Western front, the University
debaters state. He holds the position
of second lieutenant in the Royal Air
force. _

Mr. Street’s colleaguewill be Ed-

warl R. G. Heath, -chairman of the

Federation of British University Con--
servative Associations.

The series starts tomorrow and
marks the return engagement after
the tour of Western Pennsylvania by
the Reserve university team. Topic
of debate will be the national high-
school question, “Resolved: tliat the
United States government shall own
and operate the railroads.” The Uni-
versity team will argue in the affirm-
ative, having taken the negative in
last week’s debate.

Three hundred high-school stu-
dents, representing 50 high schools,
attended the series which ended last
Saturday.

Peace Council

To Reorganise
Activities Plans

“Peace Council has a completely
new object,” said Alvin L. l‘/lalakoff,
C40, president of the Council, when
announcing the meeting to be held
today in 137 Cathedral at 2:30 o’clock.

“The Council,” Malakoff stated,
“will serve as a coordinating group
for peace activity among the various
peace groups and peace programs of
the student body, instead of attempt-
ing to form any separate peace pro-
gram of its own.”

“In the face of the present division
in the peace plans of various groups,
and since outside ties to programs
have proven stronger than any loyal-
ty to a middle-of-the road Univer-
sity group, Council members feel that
it should merely provide a common
meeting ground for those interested
in peace.”

There will be no membership re-
quirements, the council’s president
stated. Anyone interested in promot-
ing world peace, and who wants to
meet other University students in-
terested in the same subject, will find
Peace Council the place to d» it.

Membership is being recruited
from three sources: all individuals
interested in peace but previously
unaffiliated; delegates or members
of campus organizations interested
in coordinating peace activity be-
tween their own group and the other
campus groups; and ﬁnally, members
of outside peace groups who are Uni-
versity students and are interested
in meeting and cooperating with
others on campus having the same
interests.

“However,” Malakoff states, “Coun—
cil has not turned its back on an ac-
tive program. A program for Armis-
tice Day is being planned, as well
as other activities. The International
Relations Club, a study group for
world affairs, affiliated with the
Council will be completely re-organ-
ized in the near future.”

 

Choral Speaking Group
Sponsors First Meeting

Objectives and plans of the year
will be discussed at an organization
meeting of the choral speaking group
which will be held in 137 Cathedral
today at 3:30 o’clock.

The meeting will be under the di-
rection of Mrs. Mildred T. Evanson,
instructor in speech, who acted in an
advisory capacty to the group last
year.

All old members, as well as any
students hitherto unacquainted with
this group and interested in choric
_D°9t-1‘y are urged to attend this meet-

mg,

¢ground of the rug blends’ with the

ITurkey red and blue trimmings to
form the room’s color scheme.

Walls, of an old parchment color.
are plastered to give the effect of
age, and the dark ceiling, boldly
carved, is touched with old English
reds and blues to form the back-
ground for English style and genuine
hand—carved furniture,

Hand—carved tables serve as
counter over which Mrs. Anna Bess
Wilson, information room secretary,
and William Daufenbach, assistant to
the dean of men, expect to answer
all questions concerning the Cathe-
dral. ‘

Chandeliers are of the ball and
chain type with antique brass arms
and were favored in Europe in the
»eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Tapestry patterns in the drapes
also harmonize with the English fur-
niture. The furnture includes two
seventeen English tables, a sixteenth
century oak cabinet, two Elizabethan
Wainscot chairs, blue—ground wool
tapestry, and three three-legged
spindle design chairs with cushions
of yellow velvet, one English oak
settee with cushion in wool ‘tapestry,
four Knole type chairs, and four
stools.

This room was made possible by a
due bill against French and Com-
pany that the late Andrew Mellon
gave to Chancellor Bowman to es-
tablish the information room on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

Doors from the room will lead to
the University Post Office and the
Syria-Lebanon room which are now
under construction.

Goalposts, Trophies,
And Good Relations

Failure to return to Carnegie T8011 the 80"‘-vllﬁlégicms‘
which were taken by University students from in front
of Scobel Hall at Tech, is another indication that van-
dalism and “incidents” may be expected in the rela-
tionship between the two schools unless the plans of the

student committees are followed.

These goalposts are to be given annually to the win-

ner of the football” game between the University and

Carnegie Tech. A ceremony and a set of rules are being
‘arranged by the student committees representing both
schools. To prevent invasions, stealing of goalposts,
property damage or injury to students is the sole object
of the new plans. It’s not a goody-goody action, but
one that stems directly from preventing any more of the
unfortunate incidents that occurred here last week.

Despite (the ‘sincere desire of most University stu-
dents to maintain the best relations with our neighbors
across the plaza, there is still, as shown by the failure
to return these goalposts, a spirit thatwill, if allowed to
"go uncurbed, drive our relations with Tech to the point
where they were in 1920-21-22 when we ‘had to break
off altogether because of the rioting before and after
games. 1

It is pretty obvious to most of us, after the affair of
a week ago last Monday, that this spirit of mass inva-
sion and pranks is an infantile one. Since this new plan
has been set up to remove the desire for such aﬁairs,
we feel that we must call for complete cooperationby
the University student body in giving it a fair test. We
ought to grow up.

Colleginns Review
The Political Scene

Despite the fact that the eyes of the nation are on
the European" war and the congressional battle over
neutrality, many are taking quick side-glances at the
current political situation, and not the least interested
of these side-glancers are the nation’s collegians.

Although the national-party political activity is still
slight on most campuses, there are many indications that
collegians in 1940 will take an active part in what poli-
-tical experts predict will be the hottest campaign in
many a year.

At Indiana ‘University, alma mater of Paul V. l\/Ic-
Nutt, prominently mentioned as a democratic presiden-
tial nominee, the republicans have enrolled more than
500 students in a campus republican club. The group
is going in for both political and social functions, and
last week held a large dance at which a nationally
famous orchestra entertained.

The University of Kansas Daily Kansan sees the cur-
rent international situation as strongly affecting poli-
tics in 1940: “Party politics are still in existence at
least among the voters, and 1940 is becoming more than
‘the promise of a new calendar from the local grocery
store. If America should be dragged into a war before
next November, would it not be feasible to induce John
Gullible Public to avoid changing horses in the middle
of the stream? Many citizens wear blinders put on by
straight-ticket—voting forebears. They refuse to recog-
nize political trends that are obvious to the point of
alarm. The moon is made ofvgreen cheese; and the
Bremen has evaporated, but can one ﬁnd a handful of
experts who will sincerely prophecy ‘it can’t happen
here?’ »  ~

The University of. Iowa Daily Iowan sees the situa-
tion in this light: “The Roosevelt stock has gone up
tremendously since the beginning of the European con-
flict; Roosevelt cannot be blamed for that. It is natural
for the people in a time of strife to gather behind a
leader. It will be an interesting election—this coming
presidential race. The new deal will still be an im-
portant issue in the campaign, but the ﬁnal score will be
effected much by the support Roosevelt has won by his
wise guidance of the foreign policy.” ’

That’s the college opinion on politics this week. It
is certain to be more deﬁnite and more prominent as

the pre-nomination battle grows in intensity.

Author Sees Purpose
In ‘Fight for Broad’

By Marjorie Johns and Virginia Worck
“The ﬁght for bread is the most moral form of war-
fare, and that need is the spearhead of purpose.”

This is the belief of Pietro Di Donato, author of .

“Christ in Concrete,” who was interviewed by The
News during his recent visit to Pittsburgh.

The handsome 28-year-old author has one objective
in writing, “to awaken the minds and hearts of the la-
boring class.”

When asked why “Christ in Concrete” does not offer
a solution to the problems of the laboring class, Mr. Di
Donato smiled and said, “As a writer, I feel my work
is to paint the picture and stimulate the reader into
seeking for himself a solution to the problems pre-
sented.”

The idea of writing the book came to him in 1936,
when, unemployed, he worried over the welfare of his
seven younger brothers and sisters.

His father was killed while working on “the job,”
when the author was twelve years old. The young
Pietro then went to work in his father’s place, and now
boasts that he was the youngest bricklayer this country
ever had.

Mr. Di Donato gives encouraging advice to hopeful
young writers. “Life, with all its intensity and drama, _

is being enacted under our very noses . . Young-
writers should not be impatient . . Years season
our thinking and mature our viewpoints . . . During

our younger years, our ideals are threatened, and only
in the passage of time do we become adjusted to
changes in them . . . Then are we ready to write!”
Mr. Di Donato is planning to write a second book
and hinted that he may use Pittsburgh as a locale for
his new work.

Harriers Try

For Third

Win In Row; Race State

Cross Country Team Wins Twice In East;

Pitt Thinclads Contenders for ICAAAA Title

Bl Ben Foote
Victorious in both starts in the East last week, the Pitt cross
«country team this Saturday will attempt to make it three in a row,
when they race the Penn State Lions over the State College golf

course.

Stamped as a leading contender for the ICAAAA team title, the

Pitt squad will go into this meet

a slight favorite, their initial ex-

perience in this position against a
‘Lion pack.

Coach Warner’s outﬁt last lost a
decision to the locals in 1936, when
an underdog Pitt team upset them at
Schenley park. The 193'? meet found
the Nittany thinclads swamping the
locals, 15-40., Last year they barely
eked out a 26-29 victory over the
Panthers;

Smith Leads Lions

“Wild Willie” Smith, 1938 ICAAAA
individual champ, led the Lions to
victory last year, setting a Schenley
park record in the process. Mr.
Smith again appears on the scene for
the State harriers, but his record to
date is not nearly so impressive as
that of Captain Zeke Sterner, Coach
Carl Olson’s hill and daler.

The only common opponent the ,

two stars have faced this year is Roy
Fehr, Michigan State’s number one
runner. Fehr defeated, Smith, but
Captain Zeke defeated Fehr by 11
seconds. Comparative records usually
mean little, but a good day for
Sterner would speak well for them.
Boulanger vs. Maule

Another leading Penn ‘State run-
ner is Frank Maule, who may meet
a tartar in Al Boulanger, Pitt’s two-
miler deluxe. Boulanger missed
early practice sessions and is just be-
ginning to hit mid-season‘ stride.

If Sterner and Boulanger can score
ﬁrst and third places, Pitt chances
for victory are dependent on the
work of Frank McCabe, Lew Manu-
wal, and Bob Graham.

McCabe is the most consistent of
the trio, and is at his best against
stiff competition. Manuwal has wilt-
ed in all of his severe tests, but can
turn the‘ tide in a close meet if he
performs up to his capabilities. Gra-
ham, another sophomore, improves
every time out.

Panthers Down Rams

Results of the Fordham cross-
country fracas were much more en-
couraging than the football scores.
The Blue and Gold thinclads downed
the Rams 21-34, Sterner leading the
Panthers for the third successive
meet.

Art Schmidlein of Fordham follow-
ed Sterner to the wire, nearly a half-
minute behind the 27 minute, 44-2

Panther Cubs Drill
For Night Contest
With Tech Plebes

A dead-earnest Panther yearling
grid squad is drilling seriously this
week for the fracas with the Carne-
gie Tech plebes Friday night under
the lights at Greensburg, Pa.

Pitt’s local rivals have a weak team
this season. They were soundly
trounced by West Virginia two weeks
ago, 39-0. The little Panthers are
anxious to chalk up their ﬁrst vic-
tory of the current campaign at the
expense of the boys from the other
side of Oakland.

Coaches Raskowski and Shea have
been stressing offensive drill in re-
cent workouts. There is €\ possibil-
ity that the freshman Will ﬂash a
passing attack centeri; around
right-half Frank Saksa. ka is a
newcomer to the squad, having joined
the team only a few weeks ago.

Physically, nearly every man
should be in top shape. Marty Var-
daro’s injured knee is responding to
treatment, and the Meadville half-
back should be ready by game time.
Jack Heister re-opened the spike
wound in his hand in last Saturday’s
game, but will undoubtedly appear
in the Tech battle. '

Cwen Social Committee
Plans Sunday Program

Mrs. George Corchoran, Pittsburgh
pianist, will be guest soloist at the
party to be given next Sunday in the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house by the
University chapter of Cwens for the
Cwens of the Carnegie Institute of
Technology.

The program planned by the social
committee of Cwens under the direc-
tion of Norma Jean Wilkes, BA42,
will include vocal so-lo by Miriam
Goldstein, C41, and a reading by Vir-
ginia Porter, C42.

The party on Sunday afternoon will
replace the annual brunch which
preceded the Pitt-Tech game. The
social committee includes Nancy
Sundstrom, C42, and Jeannette
Thompson, C42.

Collembolae Members

Collembolae, honorary natural sci-
ence fraternity, will make a ﬁeld trip
Saturday and Sunday to Cook Forest
State park, under the leadership of
Dr. Warren ,,R...Wit§,. assistant pro-A
fessor ofbiology. ‘

AL BOULANGER
A Tartar

second time turned in by Sterner for
theiﬁve-mile route.

Boulanger and McCabe for third
place, several second ahead of Char-
ley George of Fordham, Graham of
Pitt turned in his best collegiate ef-
fort, placing sixth. Manuwal was
next in, with Clark, Dolan and Col-
lery of Fordham, in eighth, ninth,
and tenth places, respectively.

For the beneﬁt of those who have
never understood the scoring meth-
od in cross-country, it is added here.
First place is awarded one point, sec-
ond place two points, etc., up through
tenth place, which receives 10 points.

The ﬁrst 10 counting in a score are
selected by the respective positions
of the front ﬁve runners on each
team. Thus, the team with the least
number of points is declared the Win-
ner.

has been aided and abetted by the services of such stalwarts as Joe

Hamilton A
e Panthers and the Pitt Club have
the Punks. In the past their cause

and Joe Cyzewski.

For this coming struggle however,
the Newmans have dipped deep into
their well of reserves and come up
with a couple of new faces, namely
Charley Ptacek and Phil Lynch.
Ptacek is a basketballer scheduled to
see a lot of action this winter, and
Lynch’s name was linked with the
Gamma Gamma Woo outﬁt last year

A background of heavy scoring,
scores being 69-0, 45-7, and 28-6,
makes the Punk outﬁt a formidable
foe for any team. A strictly aerial
oﬁense has been the mainstay of the
trackhouse gang so far, but a running
attack evolving from reverses, fea-
turing Egan and Ohl, is the ace-in-
the-hole. t

“Lefty” Ziolokowski does the pass-
ing while a trio of basketeers race
down ﬁeld as potential receivers.
Larry Port, Sam Milanovich, and
George Kocheran usually make up
the trio. The blocking job is held
down by Larry Tregoning.

Defensively the Punks are built
around rugged Paul Josephs, the cen-
ter, and lineman “Rip” Collins.

Danny Vujnovic, Jim Egan, and
Jack Scherer serve as capable re-
serves.

The Pitt Club won an easy 18-0

l victory Monday _over an inferior Pitt

Rifle team. Ruskin and I-Iurwitz
shared the honors in scoring, while
Al Norbut pulled the prize play of
the day, the hidden ball trick.

Accurate passing gave the Oil and
Gassers the nod over a poorly drilled
AE and ME seven. Bielek, Arnold,
and Artz ﬂashed rare form at inter-
vals. The score was 25-0.

The Gamma Gamma Woo team
stayed in the running when they were
donated a forfeit by the Little Panth-

Jaﬁe, our football correspondent. Mr. Jaffe is going from bad to verse.

A
try to pick them, and all we get is
the razzberries. (We don’t pick the
winners, either).‘

A costly fumble cost Pitt the ball
game against Fordham and that ex-
plains one loss. Ditto for Carnegie
Tech.

South Carolina ran back a punt
for a touchdown in the dying seconds
of the game to tie West Virginia, and
the cannon back ﬁred.

In a game marked with home runs
with men on the bases, Washington
won its ﬁrst game of the year against
the Stanford Indians. And we thought
it would be ﬁve straight!

All is not lost. The Red Raiders
of Texas ended on the short end of
a 13-0 count with Duquesne. Will
Phillip Morris hand out any cigar-
ettes for hitting that one on the nose?

The Cornhuskers win again against
Kansas State. Thanks, Biff Jones.

Penn State almost conquered Sy-
racuse. The game ended in a 6-6
deadlock.

A highly touted Duke eleven had a
narrow escape in its game with Wake
Forest. Wes McAfee scored late in
the game for the only counter.

Goal Post Snatch Beisemhles
Theft of “Brown Jug”

V By Phil Lynch
Tradition is in the making. It all began when a hilarious group
of Tech students, wild with an unexpected victory, raided Pitt Sta-
dium last year and carried away the uprights as their reward.

One decisionhowever, that giving:

the uprights to the winner of the
annual Pitt-Tech classic, is not only
a ﬁne idea, but also links the rivalry
between the schools on a more sport-
ing basis. ,

Which brings into mind the old
“brown jug” episode. This oft re-
peated story is a sports writers de-
sert, a fable thathas as _much,glam-
our as the actual football playing it-
self. It all happened at a Michigan-
Minnesota skirmish in the days of
bright vests and tan shoes.

Michigan won one of its few vic-
tories that day from a superior Goph-
er eleven. The cops, with their han-
dle bar mustaches, and fans alike
were jubilant over such an important
victory, and one Michigan rooter
scooted over to the Minnesota bench
and swiped the “little brown jug”
which was used to carry Water at
that time.

It was put on display before an

appeased Wolverine crowd, with the
score painted on the side. Since that
memorable day, the jug is more
prized than Mrs. Asterbilt’s prize
pekineese. ~

Thus there is a remarkable parallel
between two situations. If you no-
tice, after the ﬁnal whistle blows, the
winning captain is awaraded the pig-
skin as a keepsake. There can not
be ten thousand footballs for the fans,
but there are goal posts.

Till bigger and better goalposts
are made , _ . we’ll be satisﬁed with
the original ones.

Gridders to Try

Against Temple

for Comeback

Owls Saturday

I With two losses in as many games chalked up against them for the ﬁrst

time since 1924, the Pitt Panthers are preparing to entrain for Philadelphia

and the Temple game tomorrow night.

Temple is in the midst of a mediocre season under its new coach, Fred

of Temple students.

Swan, but a victory over the Panthers will right many wrongs in the eyes

Starting the season without the¢

services of Johnny Berrier, ace back,
the Owls lost a close game to the
Georgetown Hoyas, 3-2. This was
followed by a courageous stand
against the Tech Tartans but a de-
feat also resulted when George Muha
lugged the leather over the goal line.
An about face by the Temple team
found them whipping a decidedly
weak T. C. U. aggregation, 13-11.

Boston College Was the opponent
for the Owls the following week, and
Temple again bit the dust by a 19-6
score.

This last Saturday Swan and com-
pany broke out in a scoring splurge
and tallied the amazing total of 16
points while holding Bucknell score-
less.

It is against this team that Coach
Bowser sends his charges on Satur-
day. Injuries suffered in New York
and Annapolis leave the Jungle Cats
with only two centers to rely upon.

Dick Fullerton left the melee last

 

brain and will be out the remainder
of the ’ season. Allshouse, fourth
string center, broke a ﬁnger in the
“B” squad game and can anyone im-
agine a center with a broken digit.

Ted Konetsky is back on the side-
lines due to his knee injury and Ernie
Bonelli is nursing a bruised jaw, but
the rest of the squad is in fairly good
shape.

Causes Leading to War

Director of Restoration Movement F orsees
End of Dictatorship, Civilization’s Continuation
By Edgar Beigel

Dr. Jan Papanek, director of the executive committee in the
movement for the restoration of the independence of Czechoslovakia,

and former Czechoslovak consul t

international history explained “Central European Currents that Led
to War” to University students, in Stephen Foster Memorial, Monday

afternoon.

Beginning with the vicissitudes’

that led up to World VVar I, Dr.
Papanek outlined the purposes of
the Versailles Treaty, and the League
of Nations; the role of nationalism in
directing world affairs since 1919; and
optimistically portrayed the interna-
tional world of tomorrow—a world
that will exist when “nations will
realize that the state is not the end;
that human rights are supreme.”

“The idea of collective security Wlll
come back; the idea of sovereignty
and national pride will be curbed.
Then dictatorship will disappear.
Then our civilization will continue
. . . for the better future of man-
kind,” he said.

“Currents that produced World
War II were fundamentally the same
as those responsible for the ﬁrst
World War: force by Germany and
Austria-Hungary in 1914 to domi-
nate Europe, plus cross—currents of
small—nation nationalism. German
characteristics are still the same to-
days as 1914—(1) drive for domina-
tion; (2) imperialism; (3) and glor-
iﬁcation of the state, with the ac-
companying extinction of personal
liberty.

Following World War I, an attempt
to stabilize world relations appeared
when “the League of Nations made
an honest effort to curb power poli-

“In My Mind There Is No

That Those Who Fight For Freedom Will Win”

“Nationalism did not play a domi-
nant part in world politics until it
became extreme in National Socialist
Germany in 1933.” In bitterly con-
demning Nazi Germany, the Czecho-
slovak diplomat demonstrated that
“continual demands have awakened
the peoples (of the world) to the
signiﬁcance of yielding. But force
has ﬁnally been met with force.
Germany will soon have to realize
that the German race is not superior
to others.”

Dr. Papanek was enthusiastic in
dealing with the question most perti-
nent to his official and unofficial posi-
tion: the place of the small nation in
Europe. “There has been a trend for
consolidation of small nations,” he
said.

“When the Little Entente (Ru-
mania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia)
was founded, it was thought that it
would be a bulwark against the Ger-
man thrust to the east, and a Russian
movement westward. But the small
countries themselves, with their po-
litical and economic nationalisms,
could not agree. Hungary did not
want to be independent; all political

Prophecy Last Year, Fact This Year . . . “The Bill
Czechoslovakia Paid Will Not Be For Peace”

At this meeting last year, Dr. Papa-
nek, speaking on “The European
Crisis,” predicted that “we will see
that the bill Czechoslovakia paid will

not be for peace, but merely for a
postponement of a later conflict.”
Last Monday, in a more optimistic
tone, he expressed his hopes and de-
sires, with a practical plan for solu-
tion, for the creation of a peaceful
Europe during the next “few months
or years” to come.

Before becoming special secretary
to Dr. Eduard Benes, former foreign
minister and second president of
Czechoslovakia, Dr. Papanek served
in the Czechoslovak Foreign Office, as
commercial attache in Budapest, and
Washington; in the foreign ministry
at Prague; and as consul in Pitts-

Presents

0 Pittsburgh, in a review of recent

tics. The secret system of negotia-
tion gave way to open discussion.
This new system failed only because
some members of the League refused
to take their obligations seriously.

“We must all agree that Versailles
was better than Brest-Litovsk; fur-
thermore, I do not think Versailles
was as bad as it has been painted.
It was‘ based on reason and was a
justiﬁed necessity in each case.” Con-
cerning two major problems that
have focused public interest, Dr.
Papanek justified reparation and the
Polish corridor, in reasoning that
reparation payed for harm done
France and Belgium during the course
of the war. This money in turn
came to the United States in pay-
ment of Allied war debts.

Dr. Papanek, quietly portraying the
ugliness of post-war Europe, (while
newspaper ﬂash bulbs vainly tried to
distract him), pointed out that, “when
the United States and Great Britain
refused to guaranty France’s posi-
tion in Europe, France was afraid to
strengthen the democratic Germany
by giving in on any of the conditions
imposed by the Peace Treaty.” Cer-
tainly “democratic Germany should
have been helped from the outside”
but it was such lack of cooperation
that forced the National Socialist
movement.

Doubt

parties in Austria at one time or an-
other wanted to unite with Germany.
But these small countries will soon
realize that only the closest collabor-
ation will restore the freedom of the
peoples of central Europe.

“Yet it is almost impossible to
eliminate the problem of minorities.
The exchange of populations advo-
cated for the settlement of this prob-
lem should continue.” (Germany is
now following this plan in the Baltic
countries) .

“In my mind there is not the slight-
est doubt that ﬁnally those who fight
for liberty, for freedom, and for in-
dependence must win,” he summarily
declared.

Speaking later at a Faculty Club
luncheon, Dr. Papanek revealed the
part of Czechoslovak people are play-
ing in support of the Allies in the
present war.

This was the fourth occasion that
Dr. Papanek has spoken at University
functions. Last October, he spoke be-
fore a meeting of district history
teachers, at the dedication of the
Czechoslovak nationality room in the
Cathedral, and at the opening dis-
cussion of the Inquiry Forum.

burgh—the seat of the World War I
movement for Czechoslovak inde-
pendence——since 1935.

Subsequent to his appointment last
November as Dr. Benes’ private sec-
retary, he has taken over the direc-
torship, under the leadership of Dr.
Benes, of the executive committee di-
recting the movement for Czecho-
slovak independence, a fundamental
principle in the Allied program fol-
lowing World War II. With head-
quarters in Chicago, Dr. Papanek has
traveled extensively throughout the
country, visiting Pittsburgh to speak
at a mass meeting of Pittsburgh
Czechoslovaks, last Sunday, commem-
orating the 21st anniversary of the
founding of the Czechoslovak repub-
lie and to deliver the address before
the University student body.
