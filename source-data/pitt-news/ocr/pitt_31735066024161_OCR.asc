7-Eleven Store on   Forbes Ave.

Expected to Opn

Chosen Because it Would  a ‘Convenient Factor’-O

3‘! By FREDERICK BEERS

 
 

Pitt News Staff Writer ,

The 7-Eleven food store, cur-
rently under construction on
Forbes Avenue, is targeted for a

Dec. ,1 opening, according to Herb '

Chavanne, vice-president of oper-
ations for 7-Eleven.

The tentative opening is due to -

the fact that 7-Eleven ran into an

“electrical problem waiting for a A

part,” Chavanne explained».

He added that this is the‘ only‘

thing holdingiup the opening, and
that hqfeels the target date is “still
a good one,” V‘ .

Curt Graham, director of pro-
perty management at Pitt, told The
‘Pitt News that astandard commer-

cial lease was drawn up between _,

Pitt and the'Hand‘y-Mart Corpor-
ation, the parent company”. of
7-Eleven, and that it runs through
April of 1982.

Explaining the way the univer-
sityhandles the ‘storefront property
Graham said they “look ﬁrst of all
at the value of the service to the
students and the university com-
munity, we consider what would be

convenient for the students.

“One thing that‘ was a ‘serious
consideration was the fact that

presently the students had to walk -

a long distance to get convenience

- items. We thought it (the 7-Eleven)

would be quite a convenient factor

for the students,” Graham said.
When the property became

available, the university advertised

in the. Pittsburgh: Press _and '

7-Eleven was one of the interested
parties, Graham said.

In outlining ,the ._procedu’re for
determining who gets space when
it becomes available in the

storefront; John Vrana, assistant

vice chancellor for business and

- ﬁnance, said theinterested parties

submit proposals-which are review-
ed by the ‘ofﬁces of property
i-management and’ business and
ﬁnance. J . - 4
The criteria for a decision,
according to Vrana, is “service to
students and to the_ university
community. .
“It certainly appeared that some
of the articles and items that
,/7-Eleven would sell would be a
direct" beneﬁt to students.”
Vrana also cited the fact that
7-Eleven is open 24 hours.
All" lease agreements V on the
Forbes storefront are the same

Vrana said, adding,’ “there is“

consistency in all the leases. . .in

the leases,
although “no one has made any-
lkind of decision,”
tennants would probably have an
option to renegotiate when their .3, service. of some i kind to the

serviced and the people behind the
counter.

“We want registration and
ﬂying your bill to be as easy as
possible,” he continued. “Your
time here is to study, not to follow
our bureaucratic process.”

Mervis Hall is the geographic
center of the campus, according" to
Dutton. Lothrop and Forbes resi-
dents and the commuting students
who park on the upper campus

“Cmust be accounted for, as well as

those students registering from the
schools of Pharmacy, Nursing and
Engineering. Dutton said he
recognizes that College of Arts and
Sgiences (CAS) students will be
inconvenienced during registration
by having to walk two blocks from
the Cathedral’s 9th floor advising
center to Mervis.

However, the time it‘takes to
travel the two blocks is less than
the time the student would have
waited in the long lines in the old
office, he asserted. He cited that
many students in the schools of
Pharmacy, Nursing, and Engi-
neering had to walk twice that
distance to register in the
Cathedral before the move was
made.

In another matter, Dutton said

' said he foresees a time when the

registration process will be com-
pletely computer-based. There is a

now in the Registrar’s Office, but
Dutton hopes to see a more
streamlined version by the 1990’s.
if not before. The offices in the
Cathedral could not accomodate
the system that the administration
hopes to implement, while the
offices in Mervis will provide the
necessary space.

The space vacated by the offices
in the Cathedral will be used for the
expanding Graduate - School of
Business. According to Frank
Reed, Pitt’s registrar, the School of
Business wasn’t moved to Mervis
because the building had been
occupied by aninsurance company
when the university purchased it
twelve years ago. It was a building
designed to accomodate ofﬁces,
and the expense of renovating the
building to house classrooms would
have been greater than the cost of
the move of the student service
offices to Mervis, he said.

“Some of the space we’ve
vacated will be better suited to

_what they’ll be using it for,” Reed

said.
Reed said he also feels that the
move, in terms of worker effi-
ciency, was a positive one.
“We were crowded, exceedingly

overcrowded,” he said. “Work had
to be stacked on the ﬂoor. Yes, I.
think that overall we needed more

space.” ‘
Reed said heﬂviews the narrow '

hallways of Mervis as the only
detriment to the students waiting
in line, but he claimed that worker
efficiencies will make up for this.
According to Reed, the average
wait for a student has been
approximately fifteen to twenty
minutes-. At the very worst times.
the wait has
twenty to twenty-one minutes.
Reed asserted’ that theneed‘ for
better working conditions is espe-

cially acute for the Registration

Office.

“One_of the things people don’t A

understand is the Registration
Office sees more people than the
other offices combined. We see
100,000 people a year through our
doors,” Reed said. .

He also explained that the
Registrar’s Office is doing as much
as possible to offset any problems
that students might encounter
during registration. In the case of
closed sections, Reed explained
that the office has increased _its
phone service to keep the advising
center updated.

“If we didn't anticipate the
problems in the beginning then
we’ve got to immediately come up
with a solution,” Reed said.

He also pointed out that it is the
adviser’s service to advise students
on closed sections, and to remind
them that registration for night
classes require cards from the

rarely exceeded ‘

(Continued from page I,‘

College of General Studies. But he
said that students with these types
of problems are not that numerous.

“Advisers tell them orthey know
themselves,” he said. “If not, we
pick up the phone and try to correct
the problems that way."

Babs Mowrey of the. CAS
advising center said. she has not
heard of complaints from students.

“The Registrar’s Office has been
helpful. They have extended

themselves trying to keep traffic at .

a minimum,” she siad. "Every-
body has tried hard so that the
student doesn't have to come back
and forth."

But concerning the strategic
location of Mervis Hall. she had no
comment.

Reed explained that an advan-
tage to the new location has been
relatively overlooked by critics of
the move. The advantage is‘ to
handicapped students and students
in wheelchairs. The entrances for
the handicapped in the Cathedral
are on the first floor levels while at
Mervis Hall, the ofﬁces of the
registrar and student’ loans and
special accounts are directly
accessible on the ground level from
the outside.

‘In response to the confusion
among students as to the location
of Mervis Hall, Reed explained that
the university was not certain that
the move was going to take place in.

the month of October. Outside
contractors had been brought in to
renovate the ofﬁces and the

administration could not be certain .'

that the move could be completed
by early November, when registra-

 

tion for Winter term would take

place. If the move could not be
completed by ,then, the offices
would have remained in the
Cathedral until February, the next
break in the registration process.

‘ ‘We had to be very careful about «
. making a grandiose announcement

and then having to retract it,
“Reed said. He added that there

had been an ad placed in The Pitt“ 
News for a week prior tothe move  
and signs posted in the Cathedral «

in the month of October.

_Reed emphasized that the move If

was made with the students in
mind.

“Any major reduction of services A ,_q
to students would've brought it to a "'

roaring halt.” he stressed. “Ser-

vices had to be equal or better to.-f,f ' ,
the move wouldn't even have been i 1 

considered.’ ’

However, Irwin Schulman, dean

of the College of Arts and Sciences,  

does not feel that the move was  

beneﬁcial to students.

“We who are the front line feel, 
that students interests were not  
properly consulted before this was 

done, ’ ’.J_i;e,~said. ”  A 1‘

  Opinion
' Crying Wolf

Pitt resident students have cried wolf one too many
times.

On November 15, four false alarms were pulled in
Bruce Hall. Since September, 20 false alarms have
been pulled in Pitt dormatories.

Also, fire equipment, hoses and fire extinguishers
have often been vandalized by students, according to
Health and Safety technician Terry Rapp.

Besides the obvious safety hazards posed by this

vandalism, Pitt dorm students are openly demon-
strating to Pitt administrators their irresponsibility

and immaturity.

These same students undoubtedly voiced their Op- -
position to the visitation policy last year because they
believed they were adults and could monitor their

own behavior.

The message students are giving
is clear: just the opposite is true.
Residents themselves hold the means of preventing

further vandalism.

Students should be quick to report to their resident
assistant, resident director, or other authority if they
_see or suspect another student of pulling fire alarms.

Or patrolling the hallways periodically may help to

deter further vandalism.

Why this is not already being done is not clear.

Office of Residence Life director JoAnn Woodson
made herself unavailable for comment on this mat-

ter.

The recent fire on Craft Avenue and the fire at the
MGM Grand Hotel can only serve as visible remin-
ders to Pitt students of the importance and
seriousness of fire prevention. V

If the problem of false fire alarms and vandalism
does not come to an immediate halt, all dorm
residents should realize they are placing themselves in

danger.

If you cry wolf one too many times‘, someday you
may need help and it won’t be there. T- F008 , ‘ _,

Two More Big Upsets Helpthe Panther Cause

sy JEFF nunosxo

Pitt News Spons Editor

_ It was another one of those
weeks in college football as ﬁve
teams ranked in the Associated

g Press’ top 20 went down to defeat.

‘Meanwhile, with Pitt and Penn
State both idle, and two teams
ranked ahead of them in the polls
losing, the Panthers and Lions
could go into this week’s contest
ranked fourth and ﬁfth, respec-
tively.

One of the biggest defeats was
21-17

The Sooners won it when freshman
Buster Rhymes took the ball into
the endzone on a one-yard run with

56 seconds to play. If Oklahoma can

defeat Oklahoma State next week,
head for the
Orange Bowl for the fourth straight
year for a rematch of last year’s

,game against Florida State.

Tenth-ranked Michigan did a
number on arch rival and fifth-
ranked Ohio State, winning 9-3 in a
defensive struggle. With the win.
the Wolverines clinched a berth in
the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day
against Washington. _

The only touchdown of the game
was scored on a 13-yard pass from
John Wanger to Anthony Carter in
the third quarter.

The Buckeyes will now look
forward to playing Penn State in

the Fiesta Bowl on Dec. 26 in
Tempe, Ariz. '
Other losers in the top 20

included 12th-ranked Southern
a 20-17 _ loser to
18th-ranked UCLA; 14th-ranked
South Carolina, which lost 27-6 to
Cross-state rival Clemson. and
20th-ranked Texas, which lost its
third game of the season, 16-0 to
number 11 Baylor.

 
 

UCLA’s Freeman McNeil caught.
a deflected pass and ran. 58 yards
for a touchdown with just over two
minutes remaining in the game to
give the Bruins an upset over the
12th-rated Trojans.

Pitt’s Gator Bowl opponent,
South Carolina, was embarrassed
by a 6-5 Clemson team as senior
safety Willie Underwood ran back
two interceptions for touchdowns to
pace the Tigers to an easy victory.
South Carolina’s Heisman Trophy
candidate George Rogers ran for
168 yards in that loss, which
dropped the Gamecock’s record to
8-3 and may knock them out of the
top 20. .

Texas, which was once ranked as
high as second, will almost surely
drop out of the top 20 after its loss
to Baylor. The Longhorns will face
15th-ranked North Carolina, a
44-21 victor over Duke Saturday, in
the Bluebonnet -Bowl while Baylor
will take its 10-1 record to the
Cotton Bowl to face eight-ranked
Alabama Jan. 1. ~

Top-ranked Georgia did.not play
this week, but the "undefeated
Bulldogs will face Georgia Tech
next week in that always ﬁerce
rivalry. Second-rated Notre Dame
had trouble with Air Force, but
pulled out a 24-10 victory over the
Falcons. Irish halfback Phil Carter
scored the go-ahead touchdown in
the third quarter, breaking a 3-3

_ tie. The Irish, headed for the Sugar

Bowl to face Georgia, must still
play USC in Los Angeles Dec; 6.

Third-ranked Florida State was
also idle, but the Seminoles will
face 19th-ranked Florida in a
nationally televised contest, Dec. 6.

In other top-20 action, 13th-
ranked Brigham Young trounced

The Panther football team stands a good chance of moving up to fourth in the
Associated Press poll this week after Nebrask

  Steelers Lose to Bills; Eagles Defeat Raiders W

 
 

By The Associated Press

ORCHARD PARK* N.Y. Joe
Ferguson threw three scoring
passes, two of them to Jerry Butler,

"and Curtis Brown raced 34 yards

"for another touchdown Sunday as
the Buffalo Bills handed the

‘defending National Football

League champion Pittsburgh Steel-
ers a 28-13 loss.

The victory kept Buffalo in ﬁrst
«place in the American Conference
East, one game ahead of New

England, with a 9-3 record. The
Steelers. 7-5, trail Houston and
Cleveland by one game in the
AFC’s Central Division.

Ferguson found Butler on a
29-yard pass with 4:06 to go in the
ﬁrst period to tie the score at 7-7,,
then put the Bills ahead to stay on a
10-yarder to the wide receiver 6:08
into the second quarter.

Matt Bahr’s 36-yard ﬁeld goal on
the ﬁnal play of the ﬁrst half cut
Buffalo's lead to four points, but

Brown widened it to 21-10 with his
sprint that capped a 92-yard,
eight-play march late in the third.
period. Then Ferguson wrapped it
up with a 2-yard touchdown toss to
tightend Reuben Gant ﬁve plays
into the fourth quarter.

Pitltsburghis lone touchdown
came just 3:43 into" the game on
Franco Harris’ 2-yard run. It came

two plays after linebacker‘ Robin,

Cole made the ﬁrst interception of
his four-year pro career and ran the

ball 24 yards to the Bill's 2-yard‘

Two more teams bitthe dust on Saturday as the_
Ohio State Buckeyes and Nebraska Cornhuskers
were added to the diminishing list of contending

By virtue of those two losses, the sixth ranked Pan-
thers stand an excellent chance of moving to the four-
' th spot in thelmajors polls. It will also make this
week’s Pitt-Penn State match—up even more enticing
as it will probalby be a game between the fourth and
fifth rated teams in the country.
The major bowls must be crying over the fact that
they blew a chance at the Pitt-Penn State winner, '
‘especially the Orange Bowl. Even though Oklahoma
defeated Nebraska, the Sooners must still defeat
Oklahoma State to get the Orange Bowl spot to play
Florida State. If that should happen, and there’s no
reason why it shouldn’t, that would give the Orange
‘Bowl a game they would like to have avoided. 0
I Nebraska has not beaten Oklahoma in seven ’years
and have not beeneto Miami on Near Year’s in four.

the Sooners. Try to imagine the Sooner offense (or
even the Nebraska offense if Oklahoma‘ should lose
their last game) against either Pitt or P_enn State’s
defense. That alone would be enough to sell the ball
game. And who knows, a matchup against a‘ major
Eastern team might _be the right enticementto bring ’
out the Sooner routers in big numbers.

But who ever accused the Orange Bowl committee,
orany major bowl committee for that matter, of
having even the smallest amount of farsight.

With Pitt almost guaranteed the fourth spot in the

. polls and Penn State the fifth spot, the Orange Bowl
really blew it‘ this time. Especially when - one can

' consider the fact that the three teams ahead of Pitt
and Penn State will also be susceptible to the loss as
Georgia plays Aubnurniand Notre Dame, Notre Dame
has to play USC and Georgia, and Florida State has
to play Florida and probably Oklahoma. _

that in mind, the Orange Bowl won’t make big
money on the game and willbe less of an attraction.

that Oklahoma ran over in last year’s Orange Bowl"
and a team that committee members said they didn’t

Dec. 2 1980

PHILADELPHIA Wilbert Mont-
gomery’s 3-yard touchdown sweep
with 2:56 remaining rallied the
Philadelphia Eagles to a 10-7
victory over the Oakland Raiders
Sunday in a bone-rattling National
Football League defensive strug-

gle.

The Eagles, who won their
eighth consecutive game and
boosted the best won-loss record in
the‘ NFL to 11-1, fell behind with
12:23 left in the fourth period when
Oakland scored on an 86-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback

(Continued from page 8)

Jim Plunkett to wide receiver Cliff
Branch.

The Eagles drove 71 yards on
eight plays for the touchdown that
snapped a six-game Oakland
winning streak and dropped the
Raiders into a tie for first place with
San Diego in the American
Conference West.

Quarterback Ron Jaworski, who
experienced one of his worst days
of the season, started the game-
winning drive with a 33-yard pass
to Leroy Harris for a ﬁrst down at
the Oakland 28. ‘

Wilbert Montgomery gained 9
yards and then 3 for a first at the
16.

On third down, Jaworski con-
nected with Harold Carmichael for
12 yards and a ﬁrst down at the 6.

Montgomery banged for 3 and then 7-

swept the ﬁnal 3 into the corner of
the end zone.

After a scoreless first half in
which there were eight sacks, two
pass interceptions and one lost
fumble, the Eagles took a 3-0 lead
on a towering third-period 51-yard
ﬁeld goal by Tony Franklin.
