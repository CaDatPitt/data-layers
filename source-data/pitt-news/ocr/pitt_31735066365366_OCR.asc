The marches and subsequent

drawal of American troops from

ing on a local level in conjunction

tions:' Peoples Coalition for
Peace and Justice tPCPJ) and the
National Peace Action Coalition

*" In ”7omen’s Liberation Debate

Feminist Robin Morgan and
Lucy Goldberg, co-founder of the
anti-women's liberation group.
the Pussycat League. will debate

women's liberation Wednesday at ,

3 p.m. in the SU Ballroom.

Morgan is the author of the tem-
inist- anthology. Sisterhood Is
Powerful, and has publicly stated
that she is “prepared to kill or
die" for women's liberation‘. Ac-
tively involved in the movement

’ since late 1967. she was the organ-

izer of the first Miss America
pageant protest and co-founder of
WITCH (Women's International

QTerrorist'Conspiracy from Hell). .

Ms. Morgan was fired from her
job in a book publishing house for
"union organizing and radical
feminism" and was arrested for
"criminal trespass and criminal
mischief” in a 1970 Grove Press
seizure and occupation of execu-

' tive offices.

At a recent Boston appearance,
she expressed dismay with some
of her fellow feminists, only a few
being committed to revolution,
and compared the situation to late

-tifteolonial America, saying, “There
were only 17 people at the Battle
of Concord . . ."

Morgan's articles appear fre-
quently in such publications as
The Rat, Liberation Magazine,
and New York Free Press.

Goldberg. currently news edi-
tor for the Women's News Serv-
ice. is the co-authorof Purr, Baby,
Purr—-The Case Against Women's
Liberation, and co-founder. with
Jeannie Sakol. of the Pussycat
League.

 “Freedom means freedom of
choice,” say the league’s found-
ers.“‘Every woman has the option
to lead her life as she sees it.”

"Noisy militants do not speak

for the millions of married wom-A

en who find home and motherhood
gratifying. nor for the millions of
single women who enjoy the chal-
lenge of taking care of them-
selves." say the founders.

GOLDBERG: Pussycat.

The leagues philosophy is stat-
ed in the claim. “The Lambchop

is mightier that the Karate chop." A

Booze Barred At Stadium,

Effectiveness Undetermined

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Fans at the l’itt-Navy game
Saturday may have been surpris-
ed to find a notable decrease in
the amount of drinking and horse-
play in the student sections.

The decrease may have been
the result of a tightening of se-
curity and an enforcement by the
Athletic Department of the rule

prohibiting alcoholic beverages‘

inside the stadium.

The enforcement of the alcohol
rule began at the gates. Bill Mark-
us,, director of Student Activities,
who worked with Athletic Direc-
tor Casimir Myslinski in planning
the enforcement policy, said that
signs announcing the liquor pro’-
hibition were “clearly posted out-
side the stadium.”

In addition. a city policeman

was posted outside each gate.

Inside. Markus said that Pink-
erton guards asked people to open
paper bags and to shake their
blankets. If liquor was found the
owner was given two options: to
check his liquor witlrguards or
to leave the game.

Bottles checked were tagged:'

they could be picked up at the
Field House today.

Markus reported a confiscation
of approximately 60 bottles; he

SA Questions C 

Oct. 11. 1971

.   i Pangborn $$

by MIKE MILLER

The Social Commission ruffled
a few feathers Thursday night
when it called for the review of
the allocation of one student or-
ganization and balked at funding
several others.

The Franklin Pangborn Film
Club came under fire when Social
Commissioner Lenny Klavonic
announced his desire to review
the clubs allocation.

Klavonic told the Pitt News.

_ that the club had been given

enough’ money to‘ fund its films
and was permitted to charge ad-
mission to Saturday night movies
in order to finance the club’s film-
making endeavors.

Tuesday and ' Thursday ‘films,
according to Klavonic, were to be
presented free. The club has been
charging a 50 cent admission fee

‘ for Thursday night films.

Pat O'Brien. president of the
club. said that the Allocations
Committee had refused to fund
all of the movies because of their
“limited appeal." He also claim-
ed that Programs Commissioner
Dennis Concilla told him. "You
can charge anything you want."

Klavonic stated. "I don‘t feel
that money should be made off of
the students.“ He said that stu-
dent activities fees should cover
the admission prices.

After a heated debate, the film
club’s allocation was returned -to
Allocations Committee with the
recommendation that the movies
be financed entirely from activ-
ities fees (eliminating admission

'charges) and that the c_lub be

funded for equipment and projects
described in a proposal to be pre-
sented to the Allocations Com-
mittee.

The committee will consider
the recommendation Thursday.
In the spring. the committee pro-

» posed a similar funding of the film

club which-was altered by the So- . .

cial Commission.

Following the decision O‘Brien
fumed.
right on schedule. That was no de-
bate. They didn‘t,let us talk and
they didn‘t ask questions."

HILL PROJECT QUESTION ED
A request for an emergency al-
location of $500 by the Hill Educa-
tion Project was also sent back to
the Allocations Committee.

The money was requested to
cover a $325.38 deficit incurred
by the Project and current oper-
ating expenses.

The Social Commission ques-
tioned the value of the HEP to the
University. The Project recruits
students to tutor underprivileged
children.

It was recommended that the
Allocations Committee fund the
Project to cover the deficit only,
and review the function of the
Project to determine its rele-
vance to the student body and to

investigate its fiscal responslbil- ,

ity.

A request for funds by the Black
Action Society News was recom-
mitted with the recommendation
that the Allocations Committee
meet with the Provost to deter-
mine the possibility of financing
the News from that source.

Previously, the committee had‘

made funding the paper condition-
al upon the release by the BAS of
its entire budget. The BAS would

submit only d/ollar projections for

the News.

The Commission acted favor-
ably on allocations for the Pitt

Table Tennis Club. the Pitt Bowl- -

ing Club, and the Student Associa-

I tion Medical Loan Fund.

The Rifle Club. the University

of‘ Pittsburgh Free Press. and the ’

Sen

ie

by MARY WELTY

The Faculty Senate rejected
Thursday a proposal to support

' -~the Oct. 13 Student Moratorium

and cancel classes.

However. the Faculty support-
ed a motion by Professor David
Bramhall asking the faculty not
to penalize students who; skip
classes to participate in the Mora-
torium.

The Moratorium is a national

I _day of protest supporting an end

to the war in Vietnam, penal re-

' form, an end to wage freeze. and
’ an end to unemployment.

Jack Matthews, president of the
Faculty Senate, interpreted the
second motion to say, “As a facul-
ty, we, too, are concerned with the
issues of this Moratorium. We
recognize the purpose of it to be
to call attention to the weaknesses
in the present society, and we
hope that repetition of these ral-
lies will cause a change in society.
We, therefore, recognize that
some students will not attend
class and urge our colleagues to
extend respect to them for their
beliefs by not penalizing them.”

Matthews stressed. however.
that the Senate has no control over
the individual faculty member
justas the dean cannot enforce a
similar control.

Other main issues on. the Sen-‘

ate’s agenda were the Chancel-
Iors report and the results of the
Faculty Senate elections.

have ceased as of July and that the
University was meeting with the
General State Authority, the city
and the community to try to work
out the problems.

He also said that he had been
receiving harassing phone calls
from community members.

Of the Forbes discussions thus
far, the Chancellor said. "The
city and the University view of
what we can do is very far apart."

The Nominating Committee re-

Parents Invade Campus

by LORETTA HORRELL

Having received invitations
from Chancellor and Mrs. Wesley
W. Posvar. parents arrived on
campus last Friday for the Uni-
versity's annual parents‘ weekend.

The weekend's events included a
reception held by the Chancellor.
discussion groups led by adminis-
trative personnel and faculty
members. and the Pitt—Navy foot-

‘ball game. '

Welcoming the large group of
parents- to the reception in the
Commons Room of the Cathedral.
the Glee Club's vocal presentation
included skits. with one setting in
a baseball teams locker .room.
and a film shown while the group
sang How to Handle a Woman.
The Glee Club concluded their
performance with a lively presen-
tation of The Rhythm of Life.

The Chancellor spoke briefly
about the innovations at the Uni-
versity. The main topics were the
environment and the students.
“Because the environment epito-
mizes the new role of college,” he
stated, “We’re going to establish
a comprehensive
program at the University.”

Posvar also told the parents
that students have been given a
larger role in operating and struc-
-turingprograms. “Students help
establish rules and regulations.
publish newspapers and maga-
zines. structure their social pro-

environment ,

grams." he explained.

Posvar said. "We want to help
contribute to the future by mak-
ing the students the best educated
adults of the future.“ He conclud-
ed. "Your children and my chil-
dren are going to be the leaders of
the 21st century."

Scheduledto last an hour, the
discussion groups were small
compared to last year’s large
turnouts. The parents appeared to
show more interest in touring the
Nationality Rooms.

Leading the discussion on "New
Pattern Changes in Education."
Dean Jerome Schneewind had the
parents reconstruct the formal
seating arrangement of the class-
room to form a circle. an act
which the group of 15 eagerly
performed. He explained that the
crude physical rearrangement
they had just made typified the

type of changes being made in the
curriculum.

."Our willingness to change
makes the difference." said
Schneewind. "The traditional ed-
ucation. elementary school. high
school. college. graduate school.
must change because I think that
stinks."

He outlined recent changes that
have been made to alter the “tra-
ditional education.” The changes
included a student-on-leave poli-
cy, delayed entry, and the drop-
ping of a required major (which is
to be voted on Oct. 23 by the fac-
ulty in an open meeting).

Other groups discussed "Uni-
versity Community Education
Programs." “Financing Higher
Education.“ "New Teaching’
Methods in Education." and “Col-
lege—What's the Payoff ’?“

Giuseppe Verdi‘s Aida has

' been a favorite with audiences

ever since it opened the Cairo
Opera House some one-hundred
years ago. Its production this
past week by the Pittsburgh
Opera was certainly no ex-
ception.

Besides all the glitter and
glory of Verdi’s conception of
the epoch of the pharaohs,
there was the glitter and glory
at Heinz Hall on an opening
night. Such a combination not
only tickles eye and ear but
heart as well.

The cast. although not mem-
orable, performed adequately.

Gabriella Tucci, who filled
the title role, displayed a rich

‘,3,/oice and, at the same time. an
"obvious lack of dramatic style.

Bianca Berini as Amneris was
not always in good voice, espe-
cially in one passage in Act Two
where she really struggled to
reach for a- high note.

Radames, played by Pedro
Lavirgen, fulfilled his role ad-
mirably and proved himself
"Man of the hour," although
his rendition of ‘Celesta Aida‘
was. not terribly brilliant.
Thomas Tipton, certainly a good
baritone and a good "ham" on
the stage, was the productions
Amanasro.

Nicolai Moscona as Ramfis
and Earl Gorwin as the King

’ ’rounded out the featured cast.
" Both were a bit muddy in the

operas opening scene but they
improved greatly as the action
progressed.

Act One opened with
mediocre -scenery,’ and.
have already mentioned,
mediocre singing. Its second
scene brought great improve-
ment in both scenery and voices.

Act Two, the so-called Trium-
phal Scene. Good scenery, good
costumes, and good stage direc-
tion made this scene a memor-
able one. Better choreography
and an acceptable chorus helped
immeasurably.

For me. there is nothing
more thrilling in all the reper-
toire than , the finale of this
scene as all the principals of
the cast express their individual
emotions against massed chorus
and orchestra. Bravos were cer-
tainly in order for all involved.

The Nile scene in Act Three.
although not a dramatic tour de
force. moved smoothly. Act
Four demonstrated the very
able off-stage effects of vocal-
ists and chorus as well, as the
very fine voices of the two prin- ‘
cipals in their final duet.

Richard Karp, general direc-
tor of the opera, conducted the
orchestra in the pit. Its sound.
although not as full and rich as
desired, was reasonably good.
The strings, however. were a
bit shaky in the operas closing

’Aida’ Spectacle Sparkles

moments.

There are, of course. the per-
ennial complaints to be men-
tioned: the very lax policy con-
cerning latecomers, the overa-
bundance of applause during the
‘course of the opera's action
and the -audacity of many in
leaving the hall in the middle
of the last act. I found it regret-
table that the intermission be-
tween Acts Three and Four
was omitted entirely. A time ‘sav-
ing device. no doubt. but one_
with which I do not agree.

My reactions to the entire
evening were mixed. but the
overall production was, in light
of my past Pittsburgh musical
experiences. impressive. The
new hall with its spacious stage

. and production facilities proved
and

itself both acoustically
aesthetically pleasing.

This production‘ certainly
gave us all renewed confidence
in our local opera company as
well as confidence in the suit-
ability of Heinz Hall for such
operatic ventures in the fu-
ture.

Did it not help that it was Mr. O‘Bri—
en himself who was ‘delaying the start of
Woodstock’? The film was on the pro-

But were these the real reasons. or was
there some hidden motive’?

_e Civil War. “Hallelujah” was one followed by “Dixie.”
ihereference to the Civil War was significant as I was re-
minded of the First Battle of Bull Run.

If my history books are correct, that was the clash, early
in the war, which brought Northern enthusiasts out to the
battlefields with picnic lunches and gay apparel. People,
,, essed in their ‘Sunday best, arrived at the scene of the bat-
tleas if they had come to watch a polo match. The South
was expected to be massacred and everyone was eager to

ready to lie down andplay dead. In fact they actually turn-
ed the tide and sent the spectators followedby, the soldiers
fleeingfor their lives. Many were killed and from that point

g_ Two days ago, in Pittsburgh, a large number of people
howed up at Pitt Stadium expecting to see another mas-
;_sac're. They had been told that Navy ‘was a team out of Pitt’s
lass. The Middies had been smashed in their last three games
_nd the Panthers were expected to make it four in a row. Un-
fortunately (again) somebody forgot to tell the Midshipmen.

. The picnic baskets were missing, but the cocky, over-con-
‘fident attitude was very apparent. The fans were so certain
_.of-their team’s victory that they forgot to cheer the Cats’
Lwhen their names were announced. Silently they watched the
;drama unfold, a drama that made many sick to their sto-
imachs before the first 30 minutes of the game were over.

The Panthers don't have to’ make excuses for the Pitt-
avy game now that it’s all over. Everyone breathed a sigh
of relief after they cheered their lungs out when Les Block
gathered in the game—winning touchdown pass with 34 sec-
’on‘ds left in the game. The humiliation was avoided.

No, the Panthers don’t have to make any excuses, be-
«-._ca,use they. won. But that doesn't erase the fact that they
spotted Navy, the weakest team on their schedule, five touch-
‘downs before they got their machine working. That doesn’t

ate the fact that they made costly mistakes and played
hoddy football for half the game. '

by STEVE ZYCH

Playing before a crowd of
about 1,000 (their largest crowd)
at Pitt Stadium the Pitt soccer
team hung on to defeat the Tem-
ple Owls 2-1. '

After failing to score in the
first period. Chu Cho Valencia
dented the cords twice within
five. minutes in the second
frame to make it 2-0. He was
assisted by Bill Rex and Denny
Kohlmyer.

The game remained that way
until late in the third period
when Temples Mickey Cam-
pion put in a, direct penalty
kick. The goal brought the
Owls to life as previous to Cam-
pion’s tally they had only man-
aged four shots on goal.

Sparks Offense)

   

do Carriquiry, Mike Pincus and
Denny Kohlmeyer and ‘goalie
Steve Fibel were constantly
pressured throughout the rest of
the game by the Ignited Temple
offense. That Temple failed to
tie the game is a testament ‘to
the defense’s ability to keep the
ball out of their own net. The
defense has only allowed six
goals in four games for 1.50
goals-against average.

Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis
tried to keep his starting eleven
in the whole game without sub-
stituting for them, but because‘
of injuries to Len Raffa and Gus
Theofilos, he was forced to use
two substitutes. Neither Raffa
nor Theofilos will miss the
Akron game this Wendesday at
1:30 p.m. at the Stadium.

Bemis expressed concern
about his offense. stating. “They
haven't found themselves, yet
and are overloading the right
wing. Bill Rex (outside left) and
John White (inside left) aren‘t
seeing as much of the ball as
I'd like them to."

Rex. a sophomore, assisted
Valencia on one of his two
goals while White, a junior,
despite some good shots, was
shutout by Temple’s goalie For-
rest Hartman. White has three
goals in four games while Rex
has one.

Bemis felt that “Temple play-
ed as well as I expected. They
were good at the stand and pass.
especially on crossfield passes.
and their defense was big and
‘tough but slow."

The veteran coach also felt

S that his .own team, “played

 

- to keeping

 

well and it was a good one to
win in spite of the low score."

Chu Cho Valencia who scored
the two goals also felt that
“Temple worked‘ well together
and I’m glad we beat them.”

‘AS to the teams overloading
his side, the amiable rightwing
said, “I wasn‘t aware that we
are ‘overloading my side. I
feel the left wing (Bill Rex)
gets the ball as often as I do."

Relating to the failure of the
offense to score more this sea-
son Chu Cho said that "we are
hot and cold. Sometimes we look
good other times we don‘t. Also
I think that our passing could
be better. especially in regards,
the" ball on the
ground."

Bemis
out that

concurred by pointing
“the guys are putting
the ball into the'air too often
and it’s being intercepted. It’s
easier to intercept in the air
than on the ground.”

This Wednesday will tell if
the team does favor one side
as Akron has an "excellent de-
fense" according to Coach Be-
mis and such a discrepancy
should manifest itself.

With 3-3 Tie In 0.T.

The Pitt junior varsity soccer
team saw plenty of action over
the past five days as they battled
Allegheny Community College to
a 3-3 tie in double overtime last

- Thursday and then went on to

swamp the University of Pitts-
burgh at Bradford 10-0 on Saturn -
day.

Of the two games. the contest
with ACC was the more important
—-Allegheny traditionally has an
outstanding soccer team. while
Bradford is a comparatively new
and inexperienced team.

Pitt forced the match against
ACC to go into overtime when
Panther Tony Bolea scored a goal
in the third period. tying the game
at 2-2.

In the first minute of overtime
play, ACC scored a goal but with-
in the next minute Pitt rallied to
tie the score again at 3-3 on a goal
by Jorge Guitierrez. This again
forced the game into the second
and final overtime period which
ended with neither team scoring.

“I felt they (Allegheny) thought
they would have an easy time of
‘it—they had been disappointed in
having to play us, they wanted to

play our varsity," related Pitt"

coach Dick Slutzky.

Pitt dominated the play in the
first period and during the whole
second half. The booters also had
twice as many shots on goal as
Allegheny.

them.’

Seeks More Recruit

Pitts coach Sandra Bullman is
finding it difficult to recruit play-
ers for the ‘71 womens varsity
volleyball team.

Already the team has been
practicing for about a week. but
Coach Bullman feels that to have
a good team or any team for that
matter you have to have players.

"Its, a question of letting them
(women within the University)
know that volleyball has started."
stated the coach. "When I know
what I‘ve got in the way of players
I'll be able to see what we can do
this season.

“With the players that I have
so far there is a lot of potential
and a lot of material to work with.
The problem so far is that the
girls are not playing power volley-
ball but instead have been play-
ing what they’ve been use to play-
ing—recreational volleyball.”
