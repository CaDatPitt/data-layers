  race, HPV
vaccination
rates -

Brett Sholtis
Stqff Writer

A recent study by researchersfrom vari-
ous departments at Pitt and a number
of area hospitals found that African-
American women are less likely than
white women to get vaccinated against
HPV, one of the most common sexually

transmitted infections. Such lower rates,

struckthe head of an advocacy group for
African-Americans on Pitt’s campus as
“not surprising.”

“Because people may not have as
much access to health care, we tend
to put our health on the back burner,”

Black Action Society President Chandel

Boozer said.

The study, published by the Journal
of Adolescent Health, used data" from
the National Survey of Family Growth to
analyze the relationshipvbetween race,
access to health care and the decision
to receive the human papillomavirus
vaccination. The team of six research-
ers reported that there are “signiﬁcant
racial/ethnic disparities in HPV vaccina-

a Community spirit prominent in Ethiopian new year

Laura Victorelli '
For The Pitt N efws

In Ethiopia‘ and Eritrea, the first day of
the year is not a time for a countdown
and watching a ball drop on TV.
Redeate Dessalegn, an Ethiopian
law student at Pitt, remembered sitting
in the backyard of her home in Addis

 

, Ababa. Her brothers and sisters sang
’ together, trying to get the neighbors to

come over and celebrate the new year,
called Enkutatash. '
“Enkutatash is traditionally more
for girls than boys, but the boys try to
compete for attention anyway, drawing
pictures to impress all of the neighbors,”

Dessalegn said.‘

Wednesday will mark the first day
of the Ethiopian month of Meskerem
and the start of a new year. Enkutatash,

which falls on Sept. 11 each year, is a”

major holiday in Ethiopia and Eritrea
that marks the ﬁrst day of spring; which
in the Horn of Africa coincides with au-

EN KUTATASH  

tumn in the United States and Europe.
Traditionally, Ethiopians celebrate the
holiday by-gatheringaround bonﬁres
and sharing.meals together.

While the teenagers spend time cre-
ating artistic or religious tokens, the

children seek the attention of the com- .

munity’s adults. Creativity is rewarded,
often with bread or money, according to
Dessalegn, who moved to the U.S. when
she was 11. I .

When Dessalegn celebrated Enku-

tatash with her ﬁve sisters and two
brothers, the holiday favored girls. Boys
were assigned chores like cleaning. On
Buhe, a religious holiday that falls on

 Aug. 21 in the Gregorian-, or Western,

calendar,'the boys’ and girls’ roles are
switched, according to Dessalegn.

But Dessalegn said that in her home
city of Addis Ababa, Ethipoia”— the larg-
est city. and capital of the African natio_n
— the government organizes a public
bonﬁre for citizens, many of whom do
not have the space or ﬁnancialméansl

to celebrate with their own ﬁres in the '

crowded city. _
Most Ethiopian people celebrate this
holiday at bonﬁres and spend time with

family and friends, according to Abigail

Salisbury, who spent time in Ethiopia af-
ter she graduated from Pitt’s':I}aw School
in 2007. , V ‘ ,
She said that traditional dancing is
also an important part of the celebra-
tions. . ‘  ‘

“Ethiopia has very distinctive mu-

sic and a special type of dagcing done _
mostly with the shoulders, there. was . .

a lot of that,” Salisbury said in an email. '
Although many people from.Ethiopia
also celebrate‘ the Western new year,
most consider Enkutatash to be the true
new year. The two different new years are

celebrated very differently in Ethiopia. . ‘

While Ethiopians typically stay at home
with theirfamilies du-ring Enkutatash,
many celebrate on Jan. 1 by spending
time with friends or attending parties.‘
Salisbury said that the way Enku-
tatash is ‘celebrated is fundamentally
different from the way Westerners cel-
ebrate, the first day of the Gfregorjan
calendar year.  V  '
“It is similar in that it marlis a cer-

tain special time of renewalaand it is ‘

celebrated communally,” Salisbury said.

~ “However, it also has ties to religion,

seasonal changes, and Ethiopian culture
thatmake it different from a secular

V Western new year.” ‘

 

Although she’s in Pittsburgh, Des-
salegn said she might tryto eat tradi-
tional Ethiopian cuisine at a local res-
taurant. The holiday features dishes such
as doro wat, a spicy stew with meat and
vegetables, and injera, a spongy bread

with a slightly sour taste. "

The Ethiopian cultural elements of
the. holiday continue throughout the

- _ year, including a focus on sharing, family

and community.

Seifu Haileyesus, who is originally
from Addis Ababa, owns Tana, an Ethio-
pian restaurant located in East Liberty.

"Instead of holdingany kind of special
celebration, Haileyesus said he’ll go to
church Wednesday and then head home
to spend the rest of the day with his fam-
ily_ . . 4 . 4 V

“My favorite part is seeing all of the
rebirth for the NewfYear,?’.he said. “Ey-

tion” between whites, Hispanics and
African-Americans.

According to statistics from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention,
HPV is linked to cancer of the cervix,

. vulva, vagina, penis, anus and orophar-

ynx and is the most common sexually
transmittedinfection. The CDC esti-
mates that vaccination could prevent
21,000 cases of cancer every year.
The study examined survey data on
2,168 women between the ages of 15 and
24, collected between 2oo8‘and 2o1o.

‘ Sociodemographic and health care‘
accessvariables explained the di:spari_-

. ties in Hispanics, but not thosefound
in Af_rican—Americans, according to the

study. . _ r
The researchers’ analysis suggested

that Hispanicsiwereless likely to get the "

vaccine because they often did nothave

‘access tohealth care.cIn contrast, Af-

rican-Ame’rica"ns with access to health
care remained less likely than white
Americans to get vaccinated. S ;
Boozer added that her organization
tries to raise awareness of the risks of

. sexually transmitted infections and the
actions that others can take to prevent -

contraction of them. .
The researchers concluded that neg-

ative attitudes toward the vaccination

among African-American women may

play a role inthe lower rates at which

they got vaccinated for HPV.-

’ Boozer said that she thought atti-

‘tudes played a role in‘ whether women

inthe study decided to ‘get, vaccine,

’ but described an attitude thaf_.was’more
;indifferent thafn .n'e‘gative.  V. '
“I’m riot’? gonna say I ‘hay.gn’t%;heard

sions. It becomes a matter ofpersonal
responsibility instead of an honest look
at the choices given.

Of course, attention should be paid
to scale. Small to mid—size corporations
are still somewhat vulnerable to the
actions of consumers, but corporate
giants such as Apple and Walmart won’t
miss your business. This is why boy-
cotting alone simply doesn’t work. In

fact, studies have shown that it has the

exact opposite effect. Take Chick—fil-A
president and CEO Dan Cathy’s 2012
anti—gay statements. Protests, boycotts
and badnpress caused their sales to soar
12 percent, up to $4.6 billion. Apple’s
outsourcing has never been a huge se-

' cret, yettheir sales continue to climb.

When corporations abuse power and
exploit_.other countries, they’re doing
exactly what would be expected under

. a capitalist system. So it goes beyond

thinking of Apple ‘as just one corrupt

player in the game. Especially when it .

comes to electronics, most products
come with a heavier price tag than the
one shown. Microsoft, Dell, Intel and
other major brands all come with their
own set of outsourcing scandals.

The truth is that you can’t, escape
from contributing to actions you don’t
support. I can’t rightly feel proud of my-
self for turning down corrupt corpora-
tions when my tax dollars have funded

. the murder of Pakistani children (see:

Drone strikes). A
I don’t want to be the person who
criticizes others for trying to do bet-

5

ter. As I mentioned above, sometimes
it just makes me feel better not to eat at
fast food restaurants. But whether you
abstain or not, the important thing is
to honestly evaluate the choices you’re
given and actively agitate for politi-
cal change. Recognize that the prob-
lem isn’t solved when H&M decides to
manufacture clothing in regions other
than Bangladesh.

So ifyou’re going to buy a MacBook,
remember to stay angry.I

University ArtVGallery rediscovers its own collection in new exhibit  

John Lavanga
A€9’E Editor

On the back wall of the University Art Gal-
lery rests Gino Severini’s “Nature Morte,”
a 1958 color lithograph characterized by

an abstract, highly angular array of col- A

ored shapes and playing-card symbols
that seemas though they are on the verge
of motion. Though Severini is best known

for his work as a painter and his integral »

"role in the Italian Futurist movement,
the clutterand clash of parts in this piece
evokes intrigue. Yet to the trained eye, it
becomes apparent that the piece isn’t per—
fect —‘ the colors show evidence of fading.

If a single piece could encapsulate the

intent of the University Art Gallery’s new— V

est exhibition, “Rediscover: The Collec-
tion Revealed,” .it would be this fascinat-
ing — albeit faded — lithograph.

The exhibition is an astonishingly
honest one, exposing attendees to the
incredible breadth of the gallery’s col-
lection as well as the issues that the gal-
lery faces in restoring these pieces from
their current’ conditions. Some of the
most damaged pieces in the collection are
displayed prominently, highlighting both
their incredible beauty and the extensive
conservation they need. By showing off

University Art Gallery hopes to open up
a dialogue about the current state of the
University’s art collection and encourage
students to become a part of the process

of restoration.

According to University Art Gallery
curatorlsabelle Chartier, the exhibit
was made possible by a grant given to
the University Art Gallery this summer
by Heritage Preservation. The organiza-
tion, which seeks to help preserve art and

_ historic artifacts through its Conserva-

tion Assessment Program, examined ‘the
condition of the gallery, its storage facili-
ties and the environmental conditions in

 which the collection was stored. Over

the course of two days, Chartier worked
with paper conservator and conservation

.assessor Wendy Bennett to examine the

collection and problems therein.

The results were illuminating. -

In a lecture open to members of the
University, Bennett highlighted some of
the problems that she saw during her brief
overview of the gallery. Among the issues
she saw were framed pieces with cracked
glass, prints that lacked glazing, rippling
on canvases and prints, fading of colors
in some prints and paintings placed in
il1—ﬁtting frames.

Now, it’s mostly the gay j okes that have

for just one moment: Comedy Central is not
the place to go for progressive, high—brow
humor. This is the same channel that con-
tinually renews contracts for shows such as
South Park and Tosh.0. The network has a
track record of ﬂagrantly not caring about
who they offend, so I think that the bigger
issue here might be the fact that these gay
— and Jew —— jokes just weren’t funny.

You'see, as a culture, we have collec-

Though burlesque has all but died out in
its traditional form as a humorous work of
caricature —'— and then as a gloriﬁed strip-
show —- the artform still survives in niche
shows and venues around the country. In its
current state, burlesque plays off all the old
tropes, providing a mix of the racy and the
tastefully theatric. “Burlesque: The Introduc-
tion” runs along these lines, giving watchers
a taste of American burlesque with a lightly
modem-twist. I L

ART GALLERY

Additionally, the environmental condi-
tions that the pieces were stored in was an
issue. The Frick Fine Arts Building, built
in the mid-1960s, is diﬂicult to keep at a
stable humidity level. It became clear that
the collection needed serious conserva-
tion to restore the pieces and prevent deg-
radation of the collection going forward.

Rather than keep the results of the as- I

sessment quiet and attempt to ameliorate
the situation on their own, however, both
Bennett and the University Art Gallery
saw an opportunity to engage the rest of

the University in the conservation efforts. ~

. This is made clear by the prominent
display of Emil Foerster’s “Portrait of

the Foerster Family,” an 1856 piece by a A

Pittsburgh—based artist that once hung in
the Cathedral of Learning as an example of
Pittsburgh’s aﬂinity for the ﬁne arts. Now,
the piece shows signs of wear, including
small tears in the canvas and a yellowing

of the painting. The painting will be at
the center of the gallery’s conservation
efforts, which may include using new

 techniques, such as crowd—sourcing, to

fund the restoration. A 
Exposing the problems in the gallery

to the public may be the best way for the

gallery to help its efforts. As Chartier puts

it, the University Art Gallery decided that

it “should show a fragment of what we
have in the permanent collection and
raise some issues that were brought into

. light with the conservation assessment.”

In doing so, the gallery hopes to create
an understanding of the impressive art
already in Pitt’s possession, and also in-
spire students to assist in the conserva-
tion effort.

Though the exhibition is but a small
sampling of the roughly 3,000 objects
in the University’s collection, the pieces
on display speak to the depth of the col-
lection and its captivating nature. Pieces

“vary greatly, includingjapanese and Ital-

ian abstract paintings, oil paintings that
date back to the height of Pittsburgh’s
industrial era, and 16th-century Italian
prints. The diversity of the exhibition
is incredible, and it immediately raises
questions about the full holdings of Pitt’s
art collection, some of which haven’t seen
the light of a gallery in decades -4- if ever.

Such questions are what the University
Art Gallery is hoping for, as the assess-
ment spurred the gallery toward becom-
ing a space for teaching and experiential

' learning. As Yesenia Perez, a senior art

history major at Pitt who volunteers at the
University Art Gallery, said, the exhibit is
about “encouraging student interaction
with the gallery.” Many of these pieces are
still shrouded in mystery, carrying ques-

_ tions about their origins, their arrivals at

Pitt and the stories they carry'with them.
“We want people to get inspired to fol-
low the [art] and be like ‘I want to research
that,”’ Perez said.‘ V
As the gallery focuses on making con-
servation and restoration efforts, it will
also attempt to use thecollection as a
place to train a new generation of'conser—
vators. Chartier says that the gallery’s arts
lab will serve as a teaching space for stu-
dents looking to gain more experiential
learning, and she hopes that this change
in approach will foster a new relationship
between the gallery and Pitt students.
Still, the path to restoring these pieces
will not be easy. Smaller galleries such as
the University Art Gallery generally don’t
have access to the same conservation re-
sources as those of a large museum, and
this, along with the difficulty of gaining

. funding, makes restoration an ongoing
’ challenge that will take more than an

exhibitionand student interest to solve.

As Bennett said it in her lecture,
“There’s not enough people and certainly
not enough money — [that’s] conserva-
tion in a nutshell.” ‘ﬂ

Pitt preps for

New Mexico

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

' Despite suffering a 41-13 loss at the hands

of Florida State on Sept. 2, Pitt head foot-
ball coach Paul Chryst said he was im-
pressed with the team’s attitude after the
game during a press conference Monday

morning at the team’s training facility on

the South Side. .
“Everyone owned that game,” Chryst
said. “I think if you do that, you have a

chance to move forward and get better.” .

After last week’s bye, Pitt (0-1, 0-1 ACC)
moves forward this week against the New
Mexico (1-1, 0-0 Mountain West) Lobos
as the programs face each other for the
ﬁrst time in their respective histories.
Although the 28-point loss to Florida State
in week one was an eyesore, the game
held value for Chryst and the Panthers
as they continue on their "path through
the 2013 season. I ' 1

“Some of our guys got valuable reps,-

and I’m not just talking about the young
guys getting their ﬁrst snaps,” Chryst said.
“Each player’s got some things that they
can build on.” b

Although a number of freshmen con-
tributed to Pitt’s efforts Sept. 2, and 11
are now listed. on the Panthers’ two-deep
depth chart, reps in game-action also held
value for players such as quarterback Tom
Savage and tight end Manasseh Garner.

“We’ve got redshirt freshmen who
didn’t play in games last year,” Chryst

said. “There are a lot of guys who getting '
i those snaps under their belts helps. Now
_ they need to get better.”

Savage took his ﬁrst live snaps since
the 2010 season, and Garner played for
the ﬁrst time after he sat out the 2012
season due to transfervrules and scored
Pitt’s lone touchdown to cap a nine-play
80-yard game-opening drive. . ‘

Pitt head football coach Paul Chryst was
impressed with the Panther Pitt student
section when the Panthers played Florida
State Sept. 2. When the team emerged for
pregame warm—ups hours before kickoff,
the seats of Heinz Field were barren, save
for one corner.

That corner, in stark contrast to a scene
predominantly colored yellow by roughly
60,000 empty seats just two hours before

kickoff, was ﬁlled with Pitt fans clothed and ’

painted in blue —- the ﬁrst of many fans to
‘arrive for Pitt’s sold-out inaugural game as
a member of the ACC. The Panther Pitt was
there in  force and made a strong ﬁrst
impressitineon Chryst and the Panthers. -

In hisllvll/Ionday media address and in
an exclusive interview with The Pitt News,
Chryst offered his thoughts on the Panther
Pitt’s ﬁrstishowing o_f2013. ‘ i -

On what the team saw from the Panther

Paul Chryst: “I thought there was a great
atmosphere, it’s our job to make sure guys
get excited, but we’re going to need all those
students. All the players were talking about

’ that: the student section, the Panther Pitt,

the energy they felt from that. And we’ve got
to pay them back for what they did. We’ve
gotta give them a good product.”

The Pitt News: “What were your ﬁrst
impressions of the Panther Pitt?” A

PC: “It was noticeably different, -and we
appreciate it. It’s our job now, we’ve got to
keep them energized and give them more
reason. It was pretty cool.  That’s what
stuck out, this is the group that’s in it.  The
energy of it was what guys talked about and
what guys fel ” .

g3I.n€- . “ A A»
PC: “I wasn’t surprised, you kind of envi-

. sion that and knew it, and certainly under-

stood all ofthe build-up to the game. Like

‘Pitt against Florida State. anything, maybe it’s kind "of like when you

have a young player and you see what can be,
you saw that and I think that we don’t want
people to give up on this team. It can be re-
ally, really good, and that was energizing.”
TPN: “Did you have a chance to catch up
with any of the recruits at the game, and what
were their impressions of the1Panther Pitt?”
PC: “I’m going more off of the guys on this

team right now. I know there was a good feel _

from the guys that came, and I’m sure the
Panther Pitt had alot to do with that. It was
good for me, I said, ‘Do you guys like that?
We’ve gotta hold up our end.”’ - I

TPN: “If you could give a message to the
students who leave after ‘Sweet Caroline,’
what wouldthat be?”

PC: “I’d tell our players to play better. Put’

it on us: It’s a two-way street. Obviously, if
you’re to target one group, that’s the one
thing we felt the most, their energy. It’s our
job to give them energy, our job to keep the
energy going and play off each other.” I

Savage ﬁnished 15-of—28 from the pocket
against FSU and threw for 201 yards and a
touchdown, but he was intercepted twice.

"‘I think it helps he has a game un-
der his belt now,” Chryst said. “It’s been

awhile since he’s gotten hit, made a .

throw on third-and-10 or managed the
play clock. I think all those things help

every guy.”

 

September 10, 2018 1 The Pitt News] \A'/wvv.pittnevvs.c0m

Beyond Savage, Chryst said that a
major issue for the Panthers was their
performance on ﬁrst and third downs..

- “If you look at it just plain and simple,
we have to do better on third down, of-
fensively and defensively,” Chryst said.

Offensively, Pitt hopes to sustain more
drives in order to get the running game

i going. Freshmanjames Conner and junior

Isaac Bennett each carried ninetimes for
36 yards but couldn’t establish a rhythm
with the ground game.

“We weren’t very good on ﬁrst down,

:2“

so if you can stay ahead of the chains,
that helps,” Chryst said. “We were bad on

. third down, so if you convert more than

25 percent of your third downs, you get
‘more kicks at the can.” -

As Pitt now begins preparation for its
matchup with New Mexico, the Panthers
face a Lobos team coached by former Pitt
linebackers coach Bob Davie that features
an option‘-based attack that will see the
ball stay mostly on the ground. I ‘

Fitzgerald
shines in
week one _

Sean Corrado.
Staﬁ’ Writer

Every Sunday, several Pitt alumni look
to find as much success in the 1§IFL as
they did when they ran around Heinz
Field dressed in blue and gold. Over
the years, former Panthers have proven
that the road to the NFL runs through
the University of Pittsburgh.
Larry Fitzgerald

Cardinals wide "receiver Larry
Fitzgerald (P_itt 2002-2003), who had
his college number retired by the Pan-
thers on Sept. 2, starred in his first
game since the ceremony over the
weekend. , ° . ,

Not even a single minute into the
season, Fitzgerald scored on a four-
yard lob pass from Arizona’s most
prized off—season acquisition, Carson
Palmer. V

The Cardinals struggled to ﬁnd a de-
cent quarte-rbackin 2012, resulting in
a down season for the highly—talented
Fitzgerald. But now, Fitzgerald looks
to have already built a strong rapport
with Palmer: He finished the afternoon
with eight catches for 80 yards and
two touchdowns. Despite his efforts,
Arizona fell to St. Louis, 27-24. S ‘

Fitzgerald, at age 30, is still onélof
the most feared receivers in the league
and appears to be ready to lead the

‘ Cardinals to their first win of the sea-

son next week against a_ weak Detroit
secondary. With -two touchdowns on
Sunday, he is already halfway to his
2012 total, though he only found the

‘end zone four times.

Darrelle Revis

Tampa Bay welcomed a healthy Dar- I

relle Revis (Pitt 2004-2006) to its de-
fensive secondary. Revis, who missed
14 games last season because of a torn
ACL, was traded to Tampa Bay in the
offseason after spending his first six
years in the league with the New York
Jets. I ' ._
