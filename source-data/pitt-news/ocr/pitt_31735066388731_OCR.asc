Jewish

settler
accused
of murder

By Mary Sedor

Associated Press Writer

JERUSALEM — Police detained
a Jewish settler accused of fatally
shooting a 13-year-old Arab girl
Tuesday in the occupied West
Bank, and troops shot and killed
a second Palestinian, the army
said.

An Arab teenager in the oc-
cupied Gaza Strip accused Israe-
li soldiers of burying him and a
companion alive on a beach near
the town of Khan Yunis last week.
The army said it was inves-
tigating.

It was the second alleged case
of live burial by soldiers. Four
Arabs from the West Bank village
of Kfar Salem said soldiers used
a bulldozer to bury them in mud
and sand earlier this month. The
army arrested two soldiers and
said more would be detained.

The latest deaths brought to 63
the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli gunfire since violence
began in the occupied territories
on Dec. 8, according to United
Nations figures.

P. Shultz leaves Washington on

A 9285 Porsche, under loan to former Pitt running back, Craig Heyward, sustained $5000 worth of damage on Saturday night.

By Jason Hillman and
Marc Hopkins
The Pitt News

Dr. Donald Bogle spoke in
the Assembly Room of the
William Pitt Union on Mon-
day night as part of the Black
Action Society's celebration of
Black History Month.

Bogle, a film historian and
the author of two prize-
winning books, spoke about
the roles blacks have played in
American films.

”There are a lot of people
who, when they go out to the
movies today, they just sit
back and relax and automati-
cally assume that black movie
history in this country starts in
the 19805 with Richard Pryor
in The Toy or Eddie Murphy in
Beverly Hills Cop," said Bo-
gle. "Nothing could be further
from the truth. Black movie
history is quite long and ex-
traordinarily extensive.”

Bogle focused on the stereo-
types of the black American in
Hollywood movies. "The
Hollywood movie was crucial
because it was the Hollywood
movie that went all over the
world,” said Bogle.

"And it was the Hollywood
movie, with its distortions, its
dishonesties, its myths, its mis-
conceptions, its outright lies, it
was that film that was often ac-
cepted as some sort of genuine

Hollywood film was taken as
the real thing not only by
white America, but by black
America as well.”

One of the stereotypes Bo-
gle mentioned was the ‘Tom’
character. "What were ’Toms’
in American movies? ’Toms’
were always good negro
characters. They were submis-
sive, stoic, passive, kind-
hearted, good-natured, always
supported the system and
never questioned or
challenged it."

Bogle described Uncle Tom
of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Bill
‘Bojangles’ Robinson and Sid-
ney Poitier as examples of ac-

statement of the black ex- Film historian and prize-winning author, Dr.
perience in this country. The spoke in honor of Black History Month.

Author criticizes Hollywood roles

tors or roles that portrayed this
‘Tom’ stereotype.

Bogle said that, although
black actors have had more
opportunities in the 19805,
"Black actors, such as Eddie
Murphy, have no control over
their characters. White actors
played in the leading roles in
48 Hours and Trading Places.”

Bogle has written articles for
Ebony and the Saturday
Review. His two books are
Toms, Coons, Mulattos, Mam-
mies and Bucks: An Interpreta-
tive History of Blacks in
America and Brown Sugar:
Eighty Years of America's
Black Female Superstars.

Car loaned
to Heyward
crashes in
Polish Hill

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

On Saturday night, police
reported a 1980, 928$ Porsche
with "extensive damage” at 28th
Street and Brereton Road in Pol-
ish Hill and found Craig Hey-
ward, former Pitt Panther
All-American running back, at the
scene.

According to police from Zone
2/Hill District, Heyward ap-
peared on the scene to have the
car towed. However, Heyward
would not tell police whether he
was driving the car prior to the
accident. Police also saidla guard
rail was damaged.

Heyward was unavailable for
comment.

The car was registered under
E&H Motors on Brownsville
Road, South Hills. According to
Howard Sams, owner of E&H
Motors, the car was loaned to
Heyward on Friday.

"On Saturday night, it got a lit-
tle icy,” said Sams. "It was just
an accident that happened. It
cou|d’ve happened to anyone.”

Sams said that he assumes Hey-
ward was driving the car at the
time of the accident, and that the
car suffered $5,000 worth of
damage.

''I don't make a regular practice
of it [loaning out cars]," said
Sams. "But I've known Craig for
a few years, and he's a fine young
man. As years go on, he will ma-
ture more."

According to Monday's Pitts-
burgh Press, Sams said that he ar-
ranged the car loan through Eric
Metz, a Pittsburgh insurance
agent who is also associated with
Heyward's agent, Bruce Allen, of
Phoenix. However, Sams told
The Pitt News that this was in-
correct.

"Eric [Metz] had nothing to do
with getting him that car,” Sams
said.

Sams also said that his insur-
ance will pay for all damages to
the Porsche, and that he hopes to
continue business with Heyward.

"At the moment, he [Heyward]
has no credit, but any smart
businessman would want to get
him as a purchaser. He'll soon
have money in a few months, as
far as professional football."

Heyward recently decided not
to return to Pitt to play during the
1988 football season and is peti-
tioning the NFL to be allowed to

Amal captures trio who helped kidnap Marine

LEBANON — The main Shiite
Moslem militia has caught three
gunmen who kidnapped a U.S.
Marine officer serving with the
United Nations, but not the
mastermind of the abduction,
security sources said Tuesday.

The United Nations has ap-
proached Iran, Syria and the
Palestine Liberation Organiza-
tion, which have inﬂuence in Le-
banon, seeking help in the search
for Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
U.N. spokesman Mario
Zamorano said in New York.

Zamorano said the contacts
were made by Undersecretary-
General Marrack Goulding, who
was in the region when Higgins
was kidnapped last Wednesday.
The 43-year-old Marine from
Danville, Ky., is a decorated Viet-
nam veteran and was an aide to
former U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger.

The relatively moderate Shiite
militia, Amal, has seized 42 sus-
pects in a clampdown on Shiite
fundamentalists since Higgins
was abducted near Tyre, 50 miles
south of Beirut, an Amal spokes-
man said on condition of

anonymity.

Amal has been the dominant
force in predominantly Shiite
south Lebanon but is being
challenged by Hezbollah, which
is loyal to Iran and believed to be
an umbrella for Shiite radical
groups that hold most of the 25
foreigners missing in Lebanon.

Nine Americans now are
among the missing foreigners.
The hostage held longest is Ter-
ry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated
Press, kidnapped March 16,
1985.

Ball selected to settle

budget cut dispute

WASHINGTON —- President
Reagan on Tuesday picked a
veteran Capitol Hill infighter,
William L. Ball III, to step into a
simmering dispute over Pentagon
budget cuts as his new secretary
of the Navy.

White House spokesmen said
the president will nominate Ball,
a former Capitol Hill aide who
has been chief lobbyist for both
the State Department and the
White House, to succeed James

Webb, who resigned as Navy
secretary on Monday with a blast
at Secretary of Defense Frank C.
Carlucci.

"We look to Will Ball to con-
tinue working aggressively for a
strong U.S. Navy,” White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
noting Webb's charge that Car-
lucci had needlessly sacrificed
the administration's goal of a
600-ship fleet.

Fitzwater said the administra-
tion still seeks a 600-vessel Navy
but now expects that the goal will
be reached in fiscal year 1992,
more than two years after Reagan
leaves office, rather than in fiscal
year 1989 as originally planned.

Government workers

feel sting of ruling

WASHINGTON —— The Su-
preme Court Tuesday limited the
job protection for government
workers fired for lacking security
clearances.

By a 5-3 vote, the justices
agreed with the Reagan adminis-
tration that the Merit Systems Pro-
tection Board lacks authority to
decide whether the denial of
security clearance is justified.

Justice Harry A. Blackmun,
writing for the court, said, ''It
should be obvious that no one
has a right to a security
clearance.”

He said judgments about who
should receive clearance "must
be made by those with the neces-
sary expertise in protecting clas-
sified information,” and he said
the board lacks that expertise.

The court ruled against Thomas
E. Egan, who was hired in 1981
as a laborer at the Trident Naval
Refit Facility in Bremerton,
Wash., on the condition he sub-
sequently receive a security
clearance.

The facility is used to test and
repair Trident submarines. All
jobs at the facility require securi-
ty clearance.

When he was denied the clear-
ance because of two past crimi-
nal convictions, Egan was fired in
1 983.

Kidnapped girl OK
after tearful ordeal

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.
—— A 5-week—o|d girl kidnapped
last week by a woman answering
a babysitter ad was found in ap-
parently good condition Tuesday,
and a woman suspected of ab-
ducting her was arrested, police
reported.

Police Lt. Joe Venier said
Rachael Ann White was found at
a north Colorado Springs resi-
dence. A woman was taken into
custody at the scene.

"We found her, and we reunit-
ed her with her parents  at the
detective bureau," said Venier.
”There were many smiles and
tears throughout the investiga-
tions bureau here.”

The child's mother, Cora Ab-
bott, 27, had issued a nationwide
plea Monday for the safe return
of her baby.

 

Clarification

It was incorrectly stated in yesterday's
editorial that the Office of Affirmative
Action had documented cases ofdis-
crimination against homosexuals.
The office has reports of discrimina-
tion, but has not investigated any at
this time. We apologize for the
oversight.

Former
governor
stresses
reform

By Patti Ellsworth
For The Pitt News

Richard Thornburgh, the last
governor of Pennsylvania,
spoke at the Pitt Law School
yesterday on judicial reform.

tle (lis(‘Lisse(l the partisan
elettion process of judges and
jtl(ll( ial ()lll( ials Wlll( h is (ur-
rently in effect in Pennsylva-

san piot ess.

llioi'nburgh said that his at-
tempt to aholisli the partisan
I piotess was "one of lll\‘
5 tailtiies in otfite.” He also said

last attempt at judicial reform
to Cus"ter‘s l.ast Stand. ”We
salvaged what we could. The
referendum proposed was‘ to
apply the merit pr()(‘ess to only
three statewide Courts”

"The specific problem,
Thornburgh said, ’’is in getting
voters to focus on instating a
different election proces.s‘.
They don't realize that the
elections concern not only
judges and lawyers, but have
an impact on all of us. In

The independent Haaretz daily
leaked details of the plan, saying
Shultz intended to give separate
letters to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and Jordan's King Hus-
sein apparently to allay misgiv-
ings about the initiative.

The letter to Shamir promises
that Israel would not have to
wi_thdraw to its pre—1967 borders,
guarantees there would be no
Palestinian state and pledges that
Jerusalem would not be divided,
the newspaper said. In the 1967
Middle East war, Israel seized the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and
annexed east Jerusalem.

The letter to Hussein would
guarantee land would be ex-
changed for peace, and a con-
federation would be formed
between Jordan and the West
Bank and Gaza, the newspaper
said.

The army's chief psychologist,
Shlomo Dover, said 75 percent of
the 800 soldiers he questioned
were not troubled by their duties
in the occupied territories, while
another 10 percent said they
were and found it difficult carry

Police detained an Israeli settler
in the shooting death of Rawda
Najeeb in Baqa Sharqiyah, about

said several other civilians were
questioned.

The spokesman said an Israeli
car had been inside the West
Bank village about the time of the
shooting. He would not e-
laborate.

The Palestine Press Service said
the shooting was carried out by
a car carrying Israeli civilians who
entered the village of 1,500 Arabs‘-
soon after midnight. It said vil-
lagers had blocked roads with
twisted metal and burning tires
following a demonstration.

Najeeb was shot while stand-

On Al Goreography

Albert Gore is a man with a plan. In the first part of the plan,
while the rest of the candidates were scrambling madly for a
piece of the spotlight, Gore sat back with a contented smile
on his face, talking about the unreliability of the the Iowa cau-
cuses as an indicator of the national Democratic voting pro-
file. lowa is nowhere near Tennessee.

For the second part of the plan, (ioie gave the voters in New
Hampshire only a sneak preview of his positions. As his oppo-
nents made last—ditch efforts to sway voters to their sides, predict-
ing ruin for themselves based on the poll returns, Core sat even
further back, his smile grew broader and his position in the polls
dropped. New Hampshire is nowhere near Tennessee.

Now, the day of reckoning is on its way. Gore has predicted
a big win for himself all across the South during that day's vot-
ing. His slightly right—of—center views appeal to the conserva-
tive Democrats in the Bible Belt. He has something like a
home-field advantage. He now has to shine his chestful of
southern mettle, dust off his campaign rhetoric and head for
the highways. Super Tuesday happens very near Tennessee.

lt’s disquieting to see a presidential candidate willing to ig-
nore voters because of the clout he perceives them to have.
But then, we have to remember that the Oval Office isn't very
close to Tennessee either.

In a nutshell 

He's flying around in his private plane
and he hasn't paid us since October.

Are the homeless the problem?

*\fter l’itt (l(‘(. ided to divest from
South Africa, I thought I would
never be l()l‘( ed to look at another
protest shanty again. l was wrong.
The New Student Network for
So( ial Change has decided to
raise my conscience (sic) and
have built a wooden but on the
Cathedral Lawn to make me feel
sorry for the homeless.

Well, l do feel sorry for them
(thehomeless, and the NSN). I
feel sorry for the NSN because
they really don't understand the
homeless and the hungry, and I
feel sorry for the homeless and
the hungry because there are ac-
tually people who will help them.

The reason there are all these
homeless and hungry people is
simple to find: They don't have
jobs. Groups like the NSN feel
guilty that there are people who
don't have jobs and have to
scrounge in garbage cans, so they
try to help them out by giving
them handouts.

The problem here is that every
time a group like the NSN comes

WILLIAM
YOUNG

along and tries to help the home-
less, they only make things
worse. By giving these people
help, we are only encouraging
them to remain in their present
condition. Essentially, we are say-
ing, ”Don’t go look for a job and
feed yourself, we'll take care of
you.”

Some people like to assert that
the homeless are in their condi-
tion because they can't find jobs.
Unfortunately, the homeless have
nowhere to live and nothing to
eat because they don't want jobs.
Sure, some homeless may just be
too old and unskilled to find a job
now, but what was their excuse
when they were young enough
or skilled enough? The excuse,
essentially, is: Why should they
be expected to make a living for

themselves when someone else
will supply them with what they
need?

That explanation is the root of
much of the problems America
has with its "poor” people. Not
that they aren't poor, but rather
that they have no incentive to try
to raise their standard of living. If
they can do absolutely nothing
and stay alive through the

auspices of the government, why _

should they go out and find a job
and earn their own living? The
reason, of course, is that any job
they would get would pay the
same amount as they already get
by loafing, so loafing is easier.

Something should definitely be
done about the homeless and the
hungry. But that something isn't
passing out money, food and free

Shelter‘ Perhaps the
NSN would better address the
problem if they compiled a list of
all the jobs available and
matched up the homeless people
with them.

The fat lady is singing in the halls of all-male clubs

Those who have never entered
the inner sanctum of an all-male
club are likely to envision it as an
exclusive, wood—paneled retreat

with the boys.

So, on Tuesday, the Supreme
Court is going to hear what might
be called the Last Bastion Case.

of the elite. There, the very late
George Apley and his cronies,
resplendent in tweeds, still sit in
leather wing chairs, puffing pipes,
rising occasionally to toast good
fellowship and lament the loss of
the gold standard.

But this vintage 19th-century
scene has l)(‘i"'ll updated. On any
given day, sut l‘. .i < lub is not just
hosting (ieorge and his unrecon--
structed pals. It's probably serv-
ing breakfast to the law firm of
Biddle, Biddle and Fiddle, lunch
to the monthly meeting of invest-
ment bankers and dinner to the
state insurance association.

In the twilight of the 20th cen-
tury, the most vaunted private
clubs are also in the business of
business. The women excluded
from membership or banned
from the premises, women who
aren't allowed to sit in the lobby
or walk through the front door,
are penalized for doing business

It is listed formally as the New
York State Club Association vs.
City of New York. It will be a test
of the constitutionality of a law,
already copied in at least half a
dozen other cities, that would
force these clubs to choose --
gasp ~— between admitting wom-
en or giving up money.

The choice is not just an ar-
bilrary one, your money or your
manhood. Under the Constitu-
tion, any group of Americans has
the right to private association. If
the blue—eyed, right—handed bird
lovers of Wisconsin want to form
an exclusive club for the purpose
of warbling, the government can-
not force them to open up the
premises to brown-eyed, left-
handed cat fanciers.

More to the point, any group of
males, young boys or old boys,
can freely build their plywood
clubhouse and post a sign: NO

GIRLS ADMITTED. Any group of

ELLEN
GOODMAN

girls can do the same thing. But
if a private club gets involved in
public, commercial activity, how
long can it go on claiming the
rights of ”private association”?

The New York law states that
a club stops being private and
starts being sul')ject to publit laws

including those against (lis-
crimination ~— if it has more than
400 members, provides regular
meal service and gets money
from non-members ”in further-
ance of business or trade.” Most
of the rich and famous clubs do
just that.

In 1980, 37 percent of the city
club income and 26 percent of
the country club income in
America came from member-
ships that were paid by business-
es. Companies paid men to
belong to clubs that barred their
female colleagues. It's estimated

that 85 percent of the money
spent at these same clubs was
treated as a business expense, so

‘that taxpayers also supported

”private clubs.”

Columbia Law Professor Jack
Greenburg, author of the law,
made this careful distinction: ’’If
it’s a club where people hang
out, are affable and drink port, it's
not covered. But if it's the Cen-
tury Club and assorted last bas-
tions of New York business, it is.”

The case goes to the Supreme
(ourt at something of an historic
mornent. Justice Blackmun re-
cently resigned from one all-male
club. The brand—new Justice
Kennedy resigned from another
all-male club. A third Justice,
()’Conner, was once barred from
an a|l—ma|e club.

It was Justice O’Conner who
wrote the decision that opened
up the Jaycees and Rotary:
”When a club enters the market-
place of commerce in any sub-
stantial degree, it loses complete
control over its membership that
it would othenivise enjoy if it con-

1

fined its affairs to the marketplace
of ideas.” Do I hear a bell tolling
over the Century Club door?

The issue of integrating clubs is
often seen as one of those elitist
matters of importance only to a
handful of already privileged
women like the late George
Apley’s granddaughter, a Prince-
ton graduate and corporate law-
yer. But as any woman who has
ever been exclutletl from a lunch
meeting or forced to go through
the side door to join her compan-
ions tan tell you. they are a real
part of the fabric of business in
America.

In that sense, it is not an attack
on single-sex associations, the
kind many of us choose for
friendship. They are all—male and
a|l—female environments,
segregated retreats, coffee
klatches and clubs, that sustain
many of us. But business is not
private and professions are not an
all-male club.

New man has woman questioning old relationship

' Q: I have put four years into
the relationship with my regular
boyfriend, and they have been
four good years — not as excit-
ing lately as in the beginning, but
comfortable and sustaining emo-
tionally. We have pretty good to
terrific sex. Recently, a very at-
tractive man has made several
very flattering moves on me, and
I have only taken them as pleas-
ing so far as he knows, but I am
really overwhelmed.

My friends say that I should try
going out with him a few times
and see what there is in this -
but not telling my steady, in case
it's just a flash in the pan. I am
really tempted to do this, but I
know I would feel guilty and ner-
vous about my regular boyfriend.
I wonder ifl could ask my steady
how he would feel about my dat-
ing this guy a couple of times?

A: Don’t go out with the new
man on the sly —— that would be
dishonest. And dishonesty is
quite bad enough. Your private

BL®M COUNTY

self—judgment about that would
be very troubling to you. He has
put four years on a woman who
asks to go out with somebody
else who is more interesting.

In your present state of mind,
there is only one thing to do -
simply regard the new man’s at-
tentions and compliments as
pleasing, and forget about him.
When you see him again, if you
are likely to in your work, show
that you are friendly, but that you
have a whole life that occupies
your time; don't talk to him too
long, and don't go with him for
coffee. You risk too much if you
do.

If, after giving this course of ac-
tion a good try, and I mean weeks
or months, if then you still feel
very strongly interested in the
other guy, you can think about
why you have this feeling when
you already have a relationship.
Maybe that established relation-
ship really doesn’t hold you.
Then you can, if you decide to,

separate from your steady
boyfriend and look around for
someone else —— including the
fascinator, if he is still making a
play or showing real interest in
you.

DR. RlJ'I'l-I
WESTHEIMER

It would be unrealistic not to
think that, in the end, you may
decide to go with the other man,
risking a good deal since you
have a steady thing, and the new
one may in fact turn out to be a
disaster. You may see signs on
the new man's side and on yours
that determine you on that course
of action. But don't ever ask a
man to hang around while you
try someone else. That is only a
graceless way of telling him to
move on.

He has had four years with
you, and all his life he will
remember them. Why spoil his

BRUSSELS, Belgium —
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said Tuesday the Soviet
Union has made a ”very
clear” commitment to with-
draw its troops from Af-
ghanistan, even though no
firm timetable has been an-
nounced.

-U.S. sources said the Red
Army had begun preparations
to leave. Soviet soldiers were
sent to Afghanistan in Decem-
ber 1979, and an estimated
115,000 are in the country
helping the Communist
government fight Moslem in-
surgents.

North Atlantic Treaty Or-
ganization officials who at-
tended a closed meeting with
Shultz described him as hope-
ful of a Soviet withdrawal but
said he did not mention specif-
ic evidence that preparations

were undenivay.

memory of you by showing such
selfishness as asking him to put
himself on hold while you try to
find your own inclinations? Or,
while you find out if the new guy
really wants you? At least let him
think he spent four years with a
woman who knew how to be dig-
nified and considerate and cour-
ageous.

Q: I am 20, and my fiance is
26. We tried having sex a few
times, but he always comes as
soon as he tries to enter. This is
no pleasure for either of us, and
it has bothered him a lot. I worry
what effect it will have on our fu-
ture relationship.

A: Take him by the hand and
lead him to a sex therapist, be-
cause if premature ejaculation is
the sole problem in your sex life
with him, that can be cured in a
short time, using exercises that
the therapist recommends. But
don't let the matter slide, because
this condition does not go away
of its own accord.

Real premature ejaculation is

not the same as initial excitement
and overenthusiasm, which often
makes bridegrooms finish before
they have begun. That kind does
stop happening before the honey-
moon is over. If your fiance's
problem persists, do find a ther-
apist through a local hospital or
sexuality clinic.

Q: My husband and I have a
great sex life, and I enjoy a vari-
ety of things with him —— except
for one thing. When my turn
comes to give him oral sex, I am
afraid he will ejaculate in my
mouth. He doesn't, but I am al-
ways afraid of it. Would it harm
me if he did?

A: Healthy ejaculation is harm-
less. But nobody has to do any-
thing sexually that goes against
the grain. Tell him that this prac-
tice puts you off, that there are
many other nice things to do, and
that maybe someday you will feel
differently. Or, you can go on do-
ing just what you do now but tell
yourself no harm can come to
you from it.

Women's track 3rd in Big East championship

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's track team
turned in a strong performance in
the Big East Track and Field
held last
weekend at Syracuse.

A young Lady Panther squad
with only three seniors was able
to finish a strong third (82%

points) to the defending Big East
champions Villanova (140) and
host Syracuse (86).

Championship performances
for Pitt were turned in by fresh-
man sensation Keisha Demas,
who ran a 55.09 in the 400—meter
run, and the mile-relay team of
Cynthia Randolph, Gloria Azeke,
Ardythe Hope and Demas, which
was timed in 3:47.77.

Clarissa Dudley, another of the
Lady Panthers’ freshman stand-
outs, turned in a strong perfor-
mance in qualifying for the finals
in the 55-meter dash as well as
finishing third in the 200-meter
run (25.19), fourth in the
55-meter hurdles (8.30) and fifth
in the high jump (5-feet-4) and tri-
ple jump (36-feet-10).

Lady gymnasts edged

by

Tarheels, rebound

against Lady Wolfpack

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers traveled to
North Carolina last weekend
where they competed in a tri-
meet at the University of North
Carolina with |.U.P. on Friday
night. They then competed in a
quad-meet at North Carolina
State University with l.U.P. and
Georgia College.

In the tri-meet at UNC, Pitt's
180.55 managed to slide by
l.U.P.'s 179.9, but failed to out-
score UNC’s 181.15. However,
Pitt's total team score of 180.55
is the season high for the
Panthers.

Along with attaining their
highest team score of the season,
Pitt reached quite a few season
goals throughout the weekend.
Pitt's uneven parallel bar line-up
consisted of seniors Kim Calder-
one and Cathy Coleman, sopho-
more Shelly Sleith and freshmen
Robyn Borchers, Jeannie Vec-
chio, and Kathy Wallish scored a
total of 45.45 points for their
highest total on the unevens this
season.

’’I was really proud of them"
said assistant coach Ben Ro-
vee.”This is the first time they
really hit their routines on bars,"
he added.

And their scores reflected their
performances. Sleith hit a season
high of 9.2 as did Coleman with
a 9.25. Vecchio went on to win
the event with a career high of
9.6.

She ran third in the 55-meter dash
with a 7.30 clocking, fifth in the
200-meter run (25.34) as well as
running the second leg in the dis-
tance medley relay race. The re-
lay team, which consisted of
Hannah Russell, Cupid, Robin
Hubauer and Cathy Chrissos,
finished fourth in their event,
clocked in 12:26.

The 2-mile relay team of De-

Perhaps the biggest highlight of
the evening was the. balance
beam. Sophomore Hope Celani
started the Panthers off with a
solid routine scoring a season
high of 8.7. Wallish and Calder-
one had some falls, but the next
three gymnasts really set the pace
for Pitt. Vecchio scored 9.25, fol-
lowed by junior Trish Aser’s 9.1
and Sleith’s 9.3.

Borchers, who performed exi-
bition on beam, really hit an ex-
cellent routine and scored 9.4.

Sleith topped her highest all-
around total with a 36.3, and
Wallish reached her highest all-
around with a 35.25.

On Saturday night, Pitt won the
entire meet with a total score of
179.0, followed by l.U.P.'s
176.05, NCSU’s 175.25, and Ge-
orgia College’s 165.75.

Calderone, who had some mis-
takes in Friday night's meet, came
back strong on Saturday and won
the all-around with a season high
of 35.85. Sleith followed, placing
second with a 35.7.

The uneven parallel bars
proved to be another exciting
event for the Lady Panthers at
NCSU. Coleman topped her
previous performance(9.25) with
a 9.45 (her highest colligiate
score). "I knew 1 could score
higher after the first day,” said
Coleman. ”Everyone was really
psyched and ready to win, espe-
cially since we hit seven for seven
bar routines.” she added.

BRADENTON, Fla. — Ray
Miller, fired as the Minnesota
Twins’ manager despite helping
build the team that stunned base-
ball by winning the 1987 World
Series, said Monday he's never
been bitter about his ouster.

The Twins’ swift ascent from
American League West doormats
to world champions proves he
did a better job in his nearly two
seasons as manager than many
fans credited him for, said Miller,
now the Pittsburgh Pirates’ pitch-
ing coach.

Miller, long considered one of
baseball's top pitching gurus, said
his reluctance to demand the
Twins trade for more pitching led
to his September 1986 firing.

”You learn by making mis-
takes, and I made some mistakes
 but I think the people in base-
ball know I set up a good pro-
gram there, even if the general
public doesn't know,” Miller
said. ”The people in baseball
know there was no program there

before I got to Minnesota.

"I had a little trouble with the
general manager [Howard Fox].
He fired me. They fired him. But
my people - my coaches — still
stayed there, and that's the big-
gest tribute to me. They called me
and thanked me last season after
they cashed those checks for
$81,000."

Miller said the Twins’ front
office never kept their promise to
improve what was once base-
ball's worst pitching staff. It
wasn't until Tom Kelly replaced
Miller as manager and Andy
McPhail replaced Fox that the
Twins traded for bullpen stopper
Jeff Reardon.

"We had no pitching,” Miller
said. ”We tried everybody in
triple-A, everybody in double—A,
but we had a couple of kids in
single-A who were setting all
kinds of strikeout records, and I
wanted to bring them up. Instead,
we called up two utility in-
fielders.

'’I sat in a meeting with the
general manager, and he said he
wasn't going to call up any young

pitchers at the end of the season
and start them toward their ar-
bitration.

”I said to him, ‘What you're
telling me is that I made 81 ap-
pearances for you last winter and
told everybody we were going to
do everything to win, but that
wasn't true. You're telling me
where I stand.’ And I walked out
of the meeting. The next day I got
my walking papers.”

Miller said the lack of pitching
forced him to go much too long
with the ineffective Ron Davis as
his short reliever. Davis was 2-6
with a 9.08 earned run average
and only two saves in 36 appear-
ances in 1986.

"My relief pitcher wasn't get-
ting it done, but they told me,
‘No, we're going to stay with
him,’ ” Miller said. ”I should
have been more forceful "about
getting him out of there. He
wasn't the answer. But the or-
ganization kept saying, ’Be pa-
tient, be patient.’

”The owner [Carl R. Pohlad] is
a good guy, but he didn't under-

Fisher finds pitching in Pittsburghrelaxing

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. —— Brian
Fisher's year of transition took
him from the New York Yankees
to the Pittsburgh Pirates, from the
bullpen to the starting rotation,
from being miserable to being

happy-

It’s amazing what escaping
George Steinbrenner’s team can
do for a bal|p|ayer’s frame of
mind, Fisher said Tuesday at the
Pirates’ spring training camp.

’’I had a lot more fun in Pitts-
burgh; I had a lot better time and
I learned a lot more,” Fisher said.
”The manager and coaches aren't
worried about their jobs or get-
ting fired; the front office people,
they don't have a maniac running

La Valliere
signs one-
year deal

(AP) — Mike LaValliere, the
National League's Gold Glove
catcher last year, agreed to a one-
year contract Tuesday, leaving 1 1
Pittsburgh Pirates unsigned for
the 1988 season.

LaVal|iere, 27, enjoyed the best
season of his four-year career in
1987, batting .300 with one
home run and 36 RBI in 121
games while leading major
league catchers in throwing out
runners attempting to steal.

Lavalliere, obtained in an April
1 trade with the St. Louis Cardi-
nals, had never hit higher than
.234 before in the major leagues.
Voted by fellow players as the
NL’s best defensive catcher, he
threw out 49 of 115 runners at-
tempting to steal.

Left fielder Barry Bonds, who
remains unsigned, was among
several position players who
worked out on their own Tues-
day, the day before all players are
due to report to camp.

Third baseman Bobby Bonilla,
who celebrated his 25th birthday
Tuesday, and infielders Rafael
Belliard and Al Pedrique were
among the other Pirates who
worked out at Pirate City in
cloudy, 65—degree weather.

around, firing you the minute you
drop a pencil.

”That’s why I think I pitched so
much better here. I was more
relaxed.  The coaches don't run
around here saying, ’We’ve got to
win, we've got to win, we've got
to win.’ ”

Fisher, obtained from the
Yankees in the Rick Rhoden deal
in November 1986, was expect-
ed to team with Don Robinson
and give the Pirates the solid bull-
pen they had lacked since Kent
Tekulve was traded away.

Instead, neither was effective,
and Fisher was converted to a
starter while Robinson was dealt
to the San Francisco Giants.

Fisher developed into one of
the National League's best start-
ers after the All-Star break, going
7-3 with a 3.98 earned run aver-

age and winning his last four de-
cisions. He had three shutouts --
including a September two—hitter
over the St. Louis Cardinals —
and finished 11-9 with a 4.52
ERA and six complete games.

Fisher wonders whether the
Yankees would have had the pa-
tience to steer him through his
move from stopper to starter.

”Nobody panicked in Pitts-
burgh, but in New York it would
have been, ‘Uh, oh, he hasn't
pitched well in two games,’ ” he
said.

”There’s not as much pressure
in Pittsburgh; there's not as many
reporters to answer to. It's a little
easier place to play than New
York. The media isn't as hyped
up as it is in New York. Now, I
enjoy every minute I'm at the
park.”

Julia Laird

Pirates Manager Jim Leyland
said the 6—foot-4, 210—pound Fish-
er became a success when he be-
gan using all of his pitches, not
just the 90-mph fastball that
helped him record 14 saves for
the Yankees in 1985.

”He’s not home free yet, but
now he's learning how to pitch,”
Leyland said. ”When he was a
reliever and the game was on the
line, he had a tendency to go just
a certain way. Now, he knows
when he's going to pitch; he
knows how to prepare himself,
and that's been beneficial.”

Early last season, Fisher said, he
was too concerned with making’
a favorable impression on Pirates
fans, with trying to prove he
could be an extinguisher of ral-
lies rather than an ignitor of them.

’’In the pen, you always want

that stopper job, but for me to get
that stopper job here, I had to go
through Donnie Robinson, and
that was a tough thing,” Fisher
said. ”I put a lot of pressure on
myself."

The acquisition of relievers Jim
Gott and Jeff Robinson from the
Giants relaxed all of the Pirates’
starters, accoarding to Fisher.

”When we got Jeff Robinson
and Jim Gott, it was the same
thing over here. That makes a big
difference to a starter, knowing
when you come out in the eighth
inning that you're going to get
that ‘W’. In the first half of the
season, guys saw me coming out
of the pen and they said, ’Oh,
no.’
”|t’s taken a while, but now the
Pirates are learning how to win
.. and it really is fun.”

Barkley hopes better

times ahead for team

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —~
Charles Barkley figures there's a
bright side to the Philadelphia
76ers’ 15-game road losing
streak, which tied the record skid
of the Sixers’ 9-73 club in 1973.

”At least we're not going to go
9-73,” Barkley said. ”You have to
look at it in a positive way. We're
at least going to double that.”

Actually, at 22-29 and in se-
cond place in the Atlantic Divi-
sion —- though 14 games behind
Boston —— the Sixers already have
more than doubled the wins of
their 1972-73 club.

Even so, a club that only a few
years ago could legitimately
challenge for the NBA title has
lost 13 of its last 17 games, is 2-6
under new coach Jim Lynam, is
5-22 on the road and has not won
as the visitor since beating New
Jersey Dec. 23.

In addition, the 76ers are 0-2
on a five-game road trip after los-
ing 119-106 to the Houston
Rockets Monday night, with San
Antonio next up on Wednesday

Continued from page 10
”Anything's possible," Barkley
said. "We possibly could win the
rest of our games, we possibly
could lose the rest. San Antonio's
no pushover, but they're the eas-
iest game we should have on this
trip.”
The Sixers can at least look for-
ward to the return of fon/vard Cliff
binson, who has been out for
onth with a lower back strain.

The club activated Robinson
Tuesday after two weeks on the
injured list. Robinson has missed
15 games because of the injury,
which also caused him to be
hospitalized for six days. During
that span, the 76ers won only
four of 15 games and none on the
road.

”When they get Robinson
back, when they have a little time
to play together, they have the

‘ossibility of a nice team,"

Houston coach Bill Fitch said af-
ter the Rockets' win Monday.

”I’ve looked at the teams
challenging them for the last
playoff spot (in the East), and I
don't think any of them can. The
Sixers have a chance to be the
best eighth-place seed in the
playoffs. Sometimes the last team
that gets in is a dog, but this is no
dog team. In fact, they're a lot
better than that.”

Center Mike Gminski, who
came to Philadelphia from the
last-place New Jersey Nets, said
the 76ers can't consider Robin-
son ”a cure-all, but I think we'd
like to see what we could do with
him here, with one more option

In the offense, one more big

body, one more rebounder."

’’I never get used to losing,"
Gminski said. ’’I never want to,
either. And it's not easier one
place, or harder in another. The
bottom line is, it hurts wherever
you are. But there's no com-
placency about it in our locker
room. None.”

Barkley said he's past frustra-
tion with the situation.

’’It isn't getting frustrating. It's
been frustrating," Barkley said.
”... Basketball is a legitimate job
now. It's not like it used to be. It's
not fun anymore. When you're
losing, it's not fun.”

Speedskater Brown
new US sweetheart

By Rick Gano

AP Sports Writer

CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -
America may have just found it-
self a new sweetheart: Bonnie
Blair.

The speed skater boosted the
U.S. gold-medal count and spirits
at the Winter Olympics, racing
away in the 500 meters in world-
record time.

And just as America fell for a
pint-sized gymnast named Mary
Lou Retton four years ago, her
agent is hoping the nation is
ready for another fling, this time
with the freckle-faced Blair.

Jim Fink, from Blair's
hometown of Champaign, |Il.,
couldn't put a dollar value on
Monday night's performance —
she won the race in 39.10 se-
conds, hopped atop the medals
podium and cried as she sang the
national anthem.

”She’s got everything that Mary
Lou Retton had," he said at a
news conference Tuesday. ”I
hate myself for making that refer-
ence but that's the nearest one
we have. She was the small per-
son who went out and beat the
big person, the David and
Goliath pe of thin. She is very

 

    

personable and accessible.”

That's pretty much what they
said about Retton, who won the
women's all-around gymnastics
gold medal at the 1984 Los An-
geles Games.

”Sure, it would be nice to get
a little something out of it, but it's
not something I'm relying on or
going to base the rest of my life
on,” Blair said. "I want to go to
school, get myself a degree and
get a job later in life.”

Blair, 23, is close to complet-
ing a deal with Disney World,
Fink said, whose campaign slo-
gan is ”Bonnie Blair, a woman
and a winner."

”Let them play with that for a
while on Madison Avenue,” he
said, adding that Blair also has
endorsement possibilities with
food, beer, cosmetics and wom-
en's clothing companies.

Blair's blistering time eclipsed
the 39.12—second mark put up
just minutes earlier by East Ger-
many's Christa Rothenburger,
who skated two pairs earlier.

Blair is the youngest child in a
large skating family. She has five
brothers and sisters who were
skaters, as were her father and
mother.
