s Restore F orte Pitt A

By TIIELMA SIPE
A Pitt professor, Dr. John W.
Oliver, is a key ﬁgure in. the cur-
rent redevelopment plans for Point
Park. A

' Dr. Oliver, head of the history‘

department, is chairman of the
committee on historical restoration
of old Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne.

Recognizing the need fora park
to commemorate the two famous
old forts and the era of history
they represent, Dr. Oliver has been
plugging for this restoration proj-
ect since he ﬁrst came to Pitt 29
years_ ago. ' I ' - ‘

Important Historically

“Fort Pitt,” Dr. Oliver says, “is
probably the most important his-
torical point west of the Appala-
chians. When our project is ﬁn-
ished, ‘we will, in part, have made
up‘ for the" slowness in getting
started”. .‘ _ -

According to Dr. Oliver, Pitts-
burgh seemed to have an- industrial
and cultural "awakening character-
ized by s'moke-clearance and slum-
clearance after the close of World
War II. ,.

And at the same time, Dr.‘ Oli-
v.er’s dream began to turn into a
reality. . ‘

The Pittsburgh Redevelopment
Program, conducted by the Alle-
gheny Conference, a voluntary

group of civic and industrial lead- ,

ers, began making‘ plans.

“This incident proved that we are
"working above the exact spot
where the old fort stood,” ‘Dr. Oli-
Pver commented.

Two of the original ﬁve bastions
(main sections of the tort: walls)
‘are being built ‘exactly as they
stood between 1764, when the fort
was built, and 1795, when it was
dismantled. These sections are
called Flag Bastion and Grenadier
Bastion. I , -

_ The other three bastions, Mon-

_be designated on the ground and
suitably marked. iv .

“We will not be able to recon-
struct the walls of the_fort,” Dr.
Oliver stated. “But we will have
located, marked off, and preserved
36 acres of land that once played
a decisive part in the history, not
only of. Pittsburgh, but of the na-
tion.” ' - '

Religion Mujorl Set  

F orPre-_Min Students

An inter-department major in religion has been estab-
lished under the auspices of*”Dr. Raymond Brittain, assistant
professor of history andhistory of religion. ’

Realizing the ‘need of an

organized program for minis-

terial students in the undergraduate school, the University

Board has approved the program.¢
L The major is composed of as many

courses relating to religion as
could be found throughout the
various departments, 9 including

such courses as psychology,‘ soci-
ology and public speaking.

The inter-departmental major
in religion will have special value
for students who plan to take pro-
fessional training in‘ the following:
m i n i s t r y , religious education,
church administration, s o c i a 1
work, or mission work.

More than 14 major coursesiare ‘

being offered including general
evolution, Roman religion, fun-
ders of the-‘ middle ages, litera-
ture of the bible, early Christian,
Byzantine, and medieval art, re-
ligion in American society, cultur-
al anthropology, and educational
values in the bible.

Through the religion major more
adequate preparation will_ be made

‘for the graduate program in re-

ligious education under the direc-
tion of Dr. -Lawrence C. Little in
the School of Education. Dr. Brit-
tain has expressed the hope that,
“The major will not only grow
with participating ‘students but

,in courses offered. I hope that

A group of high ranking Air Force officers are about to
“take-off” having almost completed their nine month course
of Air Force Advanced Management here'at Pitt.

Thirty-ﬁve majors, lieutenant colonels and colonels
chosen-on the-basis of past records and potentialities, have

a determination that would put
‘many students to shame. These
men were sent to Pitt to study Air
Force Advanced Management.

All of the ofﬁcers achieved
their high rank by distinguishing
themselves during the. war, aid
now the Air Force wants them
trained toltake over jobsdealing
with procurement, ﬁnancing, and
Air Force .management~,

Why Pitt Was Chosen

Pitt was chosen as the training
ground for these men for several
reasons, the ﬁrst, and most im-
portant, being Pitt’s academic rat-

advantage because it makes possi-
ble ﬁeld trips to such plants as

“I was stationed in western

There is only one thing John

Playhouse Review . . .

. By Henry Lange-
With the coming of May, the

Playhouse is staging its annual

spring musical frolic. Just as

. spring with all its varied sur-

prises busts forth, so does “Three
to-One” with its sketches and
musical numbers; it too, is a
bust. , —

The current .selection is an
omnibus affair, the gleaning of
three previous revues by Nancy
Hamilton and Morgan Lewis,
which hit Broadway ”.l2\ to 15
‘years ago. . They were- “One For
the Money,” “Two For the Show”
and

cal. sketches. In this play, these

emphasize desirable and sbcially

‘Bad’ Learning -Seeps In

Along with this type of learn-
ing, however, undesirable and
often disastrous learning seeps
into the pliable young "mind; In

Intelligence Insulted

When the trustees announced‘

a few weeks ago that they hoped
to change Pitt from a streetcar
school to a campus school, ‘they
said almost at the same time that

, no ‘more buildings would be built

‘on the lawn. The intelligence of

__the student body was insulted.

The reason they won’t build on
the lawn? Trustees claim new
buildings would ruin the 1awn’s
“beauty. A new building never
hurt any piece of property and
Pitt has plenty of property go-
ing to waste.
Practically everyone is ready.

available near the Cathedral for
any more buildings. The only

  Playhouse Bustin'   Out

saves the Playhouse from pro-
ducing another musical lemon.

Lots of Stamping

With several exceptions, the
musical numbers fail to achieve
anything but a lot of stomping

and shouting. Unfortunately the

exceptions are not enough of a

cover—up and the musical end of -

the production falls ﬂat on its
face‘.

However, with the humorous
sketches, it is just the reverse.
All but one or two are wonder-
fully done, poking fun at Amer-
ican society, wedded life, and
traditional institutions in a witty
and satirical manner.

As is the case with many of the

" Playhouse’s lukewarm‘ produc-

tions, the fault lies not with the
_talent but with the play. The‘
abundance of community talent

is evident inevery presentation. ‘

M“Brain Washing" Sinks In...

There is a great" possibility that
some of the propaganda would
seep in over _a period of time. I

Typical of the American atti-
tude of former years.were the
shouts of indignation by the pa-
tients. They; seemed to feel in-
sulted by ‘the statements of the
Army officials. Why? The fact
thatdhey might have fallen for
some of the Communist propa-
ganda does not imply weak minds

«or low I.Q.’s. It could happen to

anybody, as evidenced by the un-_

explained number of highly in-

telligent peoplewho have turned-

Communist.

Formerly Americans ‘thought
of mental ailments, « tuberculosis,
cancer, arid leprosy as topics for
Whispered discussion only. This
nonsense about physical diseases
has been cleared away, but
Americans are still‘ reluctant to
concede that mental illness_can
happen to anyone.

Ray of Hope . . . 7
A few psychologists and psy-
chiatrists are working to dispel

the old notions about mental ill- _

ness. One notable ray of hope in

"Pittsburgh, at least, is a new pro- ‘

gram -entitled “Your .Mental
Health” presented weekly by a
local radio station; By dramatiz-
ing case histories, the program
‘shows that many serious cases
were no more abnormal than the
listener. —

And that one building should

A “campus school” suggests
one that is compact, not one that
claims an entire metropolis as a
campus.
pose of any Student Union build-

-ing is to bring the student body

closer together. Here at Pitt, to
achieve that purpose, it must be

built very close to the Cathedral.

‘‘white elephant.” It is costly and " ‘

without purpose.

Before making the statement;, 

that ‘jno new buildings willever

can produce. such land, they have
no right to kill the chances ‘of
real student life at Pitt. ‘

All Over  

- William -‘Putch; last seen in “The

Royal Family.” Putch’s talent
for comedy is apparent in _the
sketches, “The Shoe On the Other

Foot,” a dainty incident in the
life of a shoe salesman, and “Cold

Water Flat,” a satire on the dan- _

gers ‘of bathroom plumbing. A
star in the dancing and singing
ﬁeld goes to Mel Davidson. ‘

In the female cast, two of local

television fame head the list—- i

Florence Sando and Helen Rauh.
Miss Rauh has not been seen at
the Playhouse for a decade,‘ but
her comeback is a hilarious suc-

cess. Both are excellent in such

sketches as “The Story of the

Opera,” “Matinee _Day” and “I -. 

Hate Spring.” _

Lucy Seibert does very well in
“The Christmas Tree Bauble’?
and with Mr. Putch in “Cold Wa-S‘

ter Flat,” perhaps the best sketch ,

of this semi—failure on Craft Ave-
nue. ‘

We don’t apologize for con-’
tracting pneumonia. Similarly,
th_ere’s no need to consider

mental disease a disgrace. When__ *
We all become convinced of this, - .

then we can start working in
earnest on the prevention of

mental disease. Our schools will
have _two purposes: promoting
healthy thought and preventing
unhealthy learning, with as much“
emphasis on the latter as on the
former. I

Senator McCarthy has been-
condemned heartily for his tac-
tics in connection with American
education. He has pointed out
one detail that would be good to,
remember, however. We can’t
depend on the human mind to
separate desirable from undesir-
able thought.

Here is where the true edu-
cator prives his worth. It's up to;

him to help the student decide on--. , .-

his own philosophies. The -in‘-
structor can best do this"by ex-
amining all viewpoints abouthis
subject, and then letting the stu-
dent decide on th‘e basis of ade-
quate information, instead of re-

“A small per cent of Pittsburgh’s
Working women are hired for non-

she said. ' V “ '

Sell Yourself

.‘‘The main thing the applicant
must do in seeking‘ work,” Miss
Jones explained, “is, to sell her-

self to the employer. She must
convince him that she offers ex-

actly what he’s looking _for. And,"
shemust remember that a college
degree isn’t everything. Education
is not job insurance,” she added.
“It’s to increase her effectiveness
as a ptrson and help her to learn
to analyze and criticize construc-
tively.” 

Miss Jones, who' also handles
women’s' housing, works on the
Vocational conference for women
each spring and sponsors a senior
placement seminar.” She has in-
terviewed over 100 girls for part-
time work this year and has been
directly responsible for placing

One Weak Spot

At present, "she feels that there
is, only one weak spot in'the de-
partment which could be strength-
ened. When the women she has
interviewed do ﬁnd jobs, they don't
let the placement bureau know
where they are and what they’re
doing.

If they would report"ﬁnding a
job or later changes in jobs, said

Miss Jones, it would -be much .

easier to,.keep the bureau’s ﬁles

"bureau effective,” she concluded.

Basketball players made a clean sweep of the three ma-
jor athlete-s_cholar awards presentedin today’s Varsity Day

‘ ceremonies.

The fourth. annual affair, held under Varsity Tree in the
shadow of the Cathedral, saw Mickey Zernich, Don Virostek,
and Art ‘Boyd receive honors for achievement as Pitt ath-
letes took the Spring Festival Week spotlight.

Virostek, a second-year dental’

student, received the Athletic
Committee Award, which is con-
ferred upon the
student main-
t aining the
highest . stand-
ards of schol-
arship, athletic
ability, sports
manship, and
aptitude. The
p r e s e ntation
was made by
Dr. Frank Fer-
raro.

Z e r n i c ,h ,
team captain and president of
the Panther Club, was presented
the Charles C. Hartwig Awa1‘d——
symbolic of the greatest success in
the promotion‘ and sponsoring of
the best interests of athletes.

Their teammate, Boyd, gained
this year’s Special Achievement
Award by compiling a 2.84 scho-
lastic average—-second highest in
his class. He is also a charter
member of the Pitt chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa. ‘

Both Zernich and Boyd will en-
ter medical school next Septem-
ber. , ‘

The cit-ing of the three basket-

Boyd

‘ ballers blossomed as a timely trib-

ute "to Dr. H. C. Carlson, their
coach, who stepped down this
year after 31 years on the Panther

‘ court scene. ‘

"Achievement was the by-word
of the colorful doctor as he sought
always to- infuse (athletic effort
with higher purpose.

Zernich led Carlson’s team in

"At least, that was the opinion of
Dawson, who will have to await

cover further evidence of the

I hav learned a few rules about newspaper writing
during my four years on‘ the ‘News. For one thing: People

“ ' love to _see their name in print. And _(2): If they aren’t lucky
 enough to spot their own name, they _frequent the pages
for names of friends. So, as’ a writer I try to’ follow the

rules. _ ,
But in this obituary of a college sports editor I’m not

quantity of readers but, rather,
in reaching only a few of them.
Let’s approach this piece differ-
ently than-a news’ story and men-
tion names.of those “steady cus-
tomers” who read the sports pages
It’s their business.

I hardly think’ that
Coaches Rex Peery, Carl 01- 
son, and Ben Grady are read- Carver
ing the -News ,.for the _ ﬁrst time. These gents scan - the sports
pages regularly for names of their athletes who they feel de-
serve publicity for outstanding accomplishments. I would like
to say that reporters Will Hlivko and Dave Mazer obliged by
printing their names, not because they ‘.‘are _nice guys,” but

'-because they performed in their respective ﬁelds as superior a.th- —

letes. I ' .1 _ ‘ —

y I thank these coaches for their cooperation and sincerity during

the past year. ' '

.Red Dawson and Doc Carlson~ didn’t have

for. names of their warriors. ~

to search very hard

news for our top stories’ of the year. ‘

The rise of the_ football team was a. great oneand the recog-
nition Pitt received as’ a result is a‘ tribute to Dawson. For us
it meant stories about the ‘Coach of the Year and ‘Oranges in
l_V.[iami. ’ V 1

Unfortunately, Carlson made many headlines as he departed
from" the basketball scene. He might be termed the dream of any
sports" writer because of his effervescence as a sports personality.
Carlson‘ workd under the difficult conditions, producing teams with
average material to match a top-ﬂight schedule. ,

He was quite proud of those boys, however, and as he so aptly
phrased it, “Sometimes you" get better performance from a 30 per
cent ballplayer who_ gives you 100' per cent output than from those
100 per cent boys.” But he was quick to add, “I sure‘ would have
liked a crack at some of those 100 per‘ centers.”

Pitt is fortunate to have had thesepmen ’ representing them A
in the world of sport. * __

From, point of service to the Athletic Department Frank Carver,
who: handles all sports publicity, is the oldest and most faithful em-
ployee. Since‘ dealing with Frank I have held only the highest re-
gard for his sincerity, opinions, and advice. ‘ . '

' _Rus_s Franke, who succeeds me, is an excellent reporter. Ath-
letes, coaches, and readers can be assured of good sports _cover-
age during his tenure. But if things go wrong, Mr. Franke can

- always count on the "‘_steac_ly customers” to frequent the sports
pages. -.

Meeting

You can bet that West Virginia “Coach Steve Harrick
won’t consider Saturday’s visit to Morgantown by the Panther
baseballtnine as being “just another game.” '

-_ That’s how the Mountie

coach labeled‘ the late April

meeting of the two teams. “I’m not offering any alibis,” Har-
rick remarked after the Panthers had copped a 7-1 decision,

“but this -was just another game to us.

We’re more con

cerned over Southern Conference: ’

games.”

Saturday’s game should have‘ at
least “face” value for the Moun-
taineers. Rated a ipre-season con-
ference favorite, they are now
completely eliminated since they
have managed to win only one of
six games. They‘ will be out to
improvethe seasorfs record at the
expense of the Mittmen.

State Sweep Helps

Coach Ralph Mitterling’s Pan-
thers, on the other hand, own a
10-3 record against college com-
petition. By virtue of their two
game sweep of Penn State, the
“Panthers remain in the running
for the District 2 NCAA represen-
tative. '

~ The double win over the ‘Nit-
tany Lions over the weekend was
the ﬁrst time in history that Pitt
has been able to beat the Lions
twice straight. Also, it was the

ﬁrst win for a Mitterling coached
team at New Beaver Field. .

The dual victory over the
Lions leaves Duquesne leading
contenders for the District 2 ti-
tle. A,Pittv win at Morgantown
and a win over the unbeaten
Dukes next week, would put the
Mittiren back in the running.

Batting Improves

Meanwhile, the batting aver-
ages of the Mittmen have shown
slight improvement. Sammy Rago
leads the club with a .307 mark
followed closely by Harry Little,
hitting .306. Biggest improvement
at the plate has come. from Ollie
Niemela and Milt Emery, both
swelling their averages with re-
cent hits.
