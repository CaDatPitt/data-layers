French tells
stories

By Cesca Antonelli
Staff Writer

He leans forward as he reads, his
hands grabbing each side of the
podium. He shifts, bringing one
elbow up to rest on the surface,
sliding a hand against his cheek.
Briefly, he removes his glasses and
pauses to explain a passage.

The audience sits patiently, com-
fortably, watching him attentively.
They find themselves shifting with
him, crossing legs and resting
faces against fi_sts. The faces do
not move from the podium.

Thursday night the Pitt’s writing
program brought Albert French to
Pitt to read from his first novel,
“Billy,” which is scheduled to be
made into a movie as early as
1996. French lives in Pittsburgh
and has published two novels, with
two more waiting in the wings.

French’s is one of three readings
scheduled by the writing program
this year. On Nov. 2, Maggie

. Anderson and Catherine Gammon

will be reading for $5 donations to
the Greater Pittsburgh Community
Food Bank in the ballroom of the
William Pitt Union. On Jan. 25,
poet Charles Bernstein will read at
the Pitt Theatre.

Both students and teachers agree
that attending readings is an
important opportunity for young
writers to hear new material from
professionals.

“Readings are for writers, espe-
cially, to be able to come and see
someone who has made his own
‘way and to hear stories -we haven’t
heard before,” said Toi Derricotte,

OJ. verdict sparks mixed feelings

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staﬂ’ Writer

A white Pitt student, while walking down
the street, was told by an African-American
man that “it was a great day to be a black
guy.”

Days later, an unnamed caller to FM radio
station WRRK asked how people would react
if white people started rioting and if a black
man was pulled from his truck and was beat-
en, like a reversal of what happened follow-
ing the Rodney King case.

These are some of the racial fallouts vocal-
ized by Pittsburghers following the contro-
versial O.J. Simpson verdict.

After nine months of saturated television
and media coverage of the case, it seems that
almost everyone has formed an opinion about
O.J., and it is hard to ignore race as a factor.

“People have made comments, but I
haven’t really seen any racial tension as a
result at first,” said Tanita Harris, chair of
Pitt’s Black Action Society. “Something may
happen, but not yet.”

Harris said tensions were high about the
case in general, and more people are divided
over the verdict itself instead of the racial
issues. .

Kevin Jordan, an African-American Pitt
student, said there were some deep feelings
about the case and there probably are ten-
sions, but most people are keeping their
opinions to themselves.

“You could see it in peoples’ faces in the
cafeteria who were happy after the verdict
came out,” Jordan says. “Some people also
looked like someone died.”

Jordan says he thinks most Pitt students

In front of the room, between the frieze and the chalk-
board is the Hungarian coat of arms. This seal is topped
by the crown of St. Stephen, Hungary’s first king and

turquoise-blue, green and white birds, hearts and tulips.
In the area between the wall and the ceiling on both the

front and back walls of the room, the first two stanzas of

the Hungarian national anthem are carved into an oak

(Editor's note:  is the third of an ongoing series
highlighting the nationality rooms. )

  
  
  
 
  
 

 

Oakland is filled with historical architecture. The
Cathedral of Learning is just one of the grand buildings
that make up the skyline. But the best parts of the
Cathedral are the surprises that are to be found within.

There are 23 nationality rooms in the building. One of
them is the Hungarian room.

Upon entering room 121, you are immediately greeted
by a door adorned with ‘seven elaborate panels carved in V
elegant dark—stained oak.

As you walk further into the room, your attention is
attracted to the ﬁve sky—blue stained-glass windows that
line the outer wall, depicting ﬁve different periods of
Hungarian history.

There is a heavy contrast between the blue windows
and the rich paprika-red ceiling. The ceiling is covered

Eighteen oak class chairs are centered in three rows
atop a parquet ﬂoor. Three blue-cushioned, armed seats
have their backs to the windows near the front of the
oom. The back wall is ﬂanked by ﬁve built—in cushioned
eats.

An oak podium and teaching desk in the front of the
oom round out the furnishings.

The nationality rooms as a whole are an ongoing pro-

 ject for Pitt. There is a committee that oversees the rooms
H and plans for events and additional projects.
Tours of the nationality rooms are given every-
day, including weekends and most holidays. To schedule

“Was it me, or when he

Grimes asked after French

French says that his writ-

and it has a rhythm that

have other things to worry
about. He thinks that people

 should accept what happened
5 and put it in their past.

Some students have made
overt comments in showing
their opinion.

Tiffany Truitt, a Pitt under-
grad. said a student who was
riding the Sutherland Express
shuttle asked his friend if he
had heard the verdict.

“He replied, ‘He’s guilty as
hell. the nigger,” Truitt said. “I

couldn’t believe he said that in

the middle of the bus. There

were a lot of blacks on the bus,
and nobody said anything to
him,” says Truitt, who is white.

Joy Titus, BAS programming

chair, said that although she has
not seen any rise in racial ten-

sion at Pitt since the case, there

are some important issues about
society itself that some people
are ignoring.

‘What gets me is how people

 can say that the jury, since they
were mostly black, can’t make
V a rational decision because of
their race,” Titus said. “I don’t
think that’s true at all, because
they had a job to do.”

There are students who say

that there is no rise in racial ten-
sions because of the Simpson
case..They say those tensions
have already been there.

One African-American stu-

dent who wouldn’t give his
name said that he has had two
or three run-ins with “skin
heads” on Forbes Avenue.

“I was walking down the

street, and this guy walked by
looking right at me. He was
singing about Hitler and
Nazis.”

The student said he feels that

these issues need to be
addressed by blacks and whites
together. He said the problems
are there and we need to deal
with it regardless of what hap-
pens to O.J. Simpson.

Judicial revenge?

Not guilty on all counts. That means O.J. walks out of the
courtroom a free man. But that does not mean 01. walks out
of a courtroom for the last time. In fact, O.J. is going to
become very familiar with another courtroom some time in
the near future if the Goldman family has its way.

Ron Goldman’s parents are currently initiating civil court
proceedings against O.J. Simpson for the wrongful death of
their son. Many people have questioned why the Goldmans
would bother to sueonce Simpson had already been acquitted
of the crimes. These same people also think the Goldmans are
only doing this for the money (they are suing Simpson for
$50 million).

However, the fact that Simpson was acquitted of murdering

-Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in criminal court

proceedings does not mean he will not be held liable civilly
for wrongful death. There are several major differences
between criminal and civil courts which make it possible that
the Goldmans will win their claim despite the acquittal.

First, in civil court the burden of proof is on Simpson. It is
up to him toprove he did not have a part in Ron Goldman’s
death. Wrongful death only requires that Simpson had some
part in Goldman’s death, not that he actually wielded the
knife. Civil suits also only require that nine members of the
l2—person jury agree. An unanimous verdict is not necessary
in a wrongful death suit. Civil court also will allow some of
the evidence which was excluded in the criminal trial to find
its way in front of the jury. The infamous Bronco chase might
be played in the courtroom, or all thirty-something of the
Fuhrman tapes might be played. Nothing will be ruled inad-
missible in a civil trial. Finally, Simpson cannot plead the
Fifth Amendment in civil court. If asked, he will have to
speak in front of the jury to prove he wasn’t involved.

The Goldmans are entirely justified in pursuing the wrong-
ful death suit in the civil courts.- They believe that O.J. was
involved in their son’s death, despite the acquittal of first
degree murder. (It is quite possible for O.J. to have been
involved in the deaths without having been convicted of first
degree murder.) In light of that belief, the Goldmans are tak-
ing a legal course of action, instead of resorting to hired hit-
"men of vigilante justice, to seek the justice they feel they
deserve. _

The Goldmans are asking a civil jury to award them $50
million. That seems like a lot, and it is. It also seems like it
might be a plot to get rich quick, but it is not. The reason
such a large sum is appropriate in this case is because any-
thing smaller would not make a dent in Simpson’s bank
account. The sales from Simpson’s book have already cov-
ered his legal expenses from the criminal trial:

The Goldmans are asking for legal revenge for the loss of
their son, and they deserve it.

Behind the Jane Roe switcheroo

ome-
timesl
wish

evangelical
Christianity
wasn’t so
closely con-
nected to the
anti-abortion

 

movement.
Rick B.“. ‘
Nowlin because It is,

the recent

Christian conversion of Norma
McCorvey looks and sounds
more like a political statement
than a spiritual one.

If the name doesn’t sound
familiar, you may remember
her better by her alias, Jane
Roe. That’s right, she was the
woman involved in the 1973
Supreme Court decision Roe v.
Wade, which legalized abortion
nationwide. She had been a
spokeswoman for the national
pro-choice movement for 20
years and more recently served
as marketing director for A
Choice for Women, a Dallas
abortion clinic.

So you can imagine the shock
waves when she called a press
conference on Aug. 9 to
armounce her decision to aban-
don her pro-choice activities,
including quitting her job.

What happened? Well,
according to an ABC News
story by religion correspondent
Peggy Wehmeyer, this change
of heart began with her view-

ing a number of aborted fetuses‘

in the clinic’s cooler and realiz-
ing that a daughter of hers (the
object of Roe v. Wade who was
born two years before the
Supreme Court, decision was
announced) could have been
among them.-Not long after
that, Operation Rescue, the mil-
itant anti-abortion group,
opened its national headquar-
ters right next door to the abor-
tion clinic. -Despite her initial
misgivings, Norma became

' friendly with OR’s national

director, a minister named
Philip “Flip” Benham.
Over time, she got to meet

with other believers, who may
or may not have been activists,
and she said they cared about
her as a person more than the
pro-choice folks she knew. She
said she decided to leave the
pro-choice movement in part
because she felt neglected, used
and abused by those who were
supposedly supporting her —
and that she was tired of being
a symbol. ,

Indeed, both sides of the
abortion issue were using her as
a symbol, as anti-abortion
groups often noted her savory

past. McCorvey had an alco-

holic mother; was in and out of
reform school by age 15; was
married at 16 and later
divorced; admitted that she had
lied about the circumstances
leading up to the Supreme
Court case (she initially said
she had been raped because she
erroneously thought that abor-
tion in that case was legal in
Texas); and at the time of the
story was involved in a lesbian
relationship. The obvious con-
notation is, of course, that
“we’re morally upright, and
they’re not.”

Needless to say, pro-lifers
hope that McCorvey’s defec-
tion to their side will give the
movement a public-relations
boost, as it has taken a number
of hits over the past seven
years. Consider the nationally-
publicized shootings of doctors
and clinic workers, its relatively
tepid denunciations of such and
OR’s formerly being sued into
bankruptcy when it was head-
quartered in Binghamton, NY.
On the other hand, attorney
Sarah Weddington, who argued
the case before the Supreme
Court, tried to downplay the
switch, noting that “[Roe v.
Wade] was a class-action suit,
anyway” — perhaps giving cre-
dence to McCorvey’s assertion
that she wasn’t important in the
first place. (Despite my own
pro-life leanings, I don’t think
it’ll make much difference.)

I can see now the parallels
that some preachers will make,

and probably have already
made, between McCorvey and
the apostle Paul, the most noto-
rious enemy of the then—ﬂedg—
ling church before his dramatic
conversion on the Damascus
Road. Therein lies my problem
with the church’s emphasis on
abortion (which, by the way, is
nowhere directly addressed in
the Bible). I wonder why peo-
ple prayed for McCorvey to
become a Christian: was the
concern for her eternal destiny
or was it so that she would join
their cause? If the latter, I
would say that their motives
were flawed.

And it wouldn’t be the first
time. A few years ago, a local
fundamentalist church publi-
cized a speech by Village Voice
columnist Nat Hentoff, a rela-
tively recent convert to the pro-
life cause. The trouble is that
Hentoff otherwise promotes
secular humanism, defined as
“the human race being the ulti-
mate master,” which that same
church probably condemns as
America’s biggest social and
moral problem. And what
about the politicians Christians
support simply because they
oppose abortion, disregarding
their ethical double standards?
Take (please!) Republican pres-
idential candidates Bob Dole
and Phil Gramm and Speaker
of the House Newt Gingrich,
pro-lifers, all of whom have left
wives at some point in their
lives; Gingrich even had the
audacity to serve his first wife
with divorce papers as she was
coming out of cancer surgery!

I’m not saying that the
church shouldn't take stands on
moral issues. However, in
doing so, it could very well
abandon its ultimate purpose, to
display God’s love for others
through the person of Jesus
Christ.

That’s why Norma
McCorvey became a Christian.

Pitt-BC:
o blissful
football

' well-designed
A college foot-
. ball teams go
at it. That’s
why I was in
. true and utter
bliss when I
spent three-and-a-half hours
last Saturday watching the
Pitt—Boston College game.
For those of you who missed

it, let me be the first to say that
it was a priceless treat for any

spectator.

The game had it all: fme-
tuned offensive attacks, gritty
defensive stops and nonstop
action.

The end product was a 17-0
BC shutout — which kept
44,500 raucous Eagle fans
clinging to the edge of their
seats up until the bittersweet
end. 5

The victory was sweet for
BC, as it snapped its two-game
losing streak and upped its
record to 2-3 and 2-0 in Big
East play. For Pitt it’s a differ-
ent story. The Panthers (2-4)
continued to struggle as they
dropped their fourth straight
game and, in the process, lost
their ninth consecutive road
game.

Despite the loss to a sub—par
BC squad, the Panthers proved
they can still move the ball on
offense without their top guns.
With running backs Billy West
(out for the season with a bro-
ken leg) and his trusty backup,
Demetrius Harris (sprained
toe), sidelined, Pitt amassed a
hearty -11 yards rushing. Yes,
that’s a negative sign in front
of that impressive number.

Vince Williams, fresh off a
hamstring injury, led the
depleted running attack with
14 yards on 8 carries. For
those math buffs out there,
that’s a hefty 1.8 yards per
carry. Chris Patton, still nurs-
ing a sore shoulder, added 5
yards on three carries; and
Harris, who had to leave the
game early, totalled one yard
on seven carries. Furthermore,
starting fullback Chris
Schneider, the only healthy
back of the bunch, notched
negative one yard.

But don’t let _those statistics
fool you. Pitt would have had

19 yards rushing if you were to -

omit quarterback John Ryan’s
stats. Ryan was sacked three
times for - 30 yards.

Ryan’s air attack was equal-
ly impressive. He completed
10 of 24 passes for a walloping
90 yards, while adding two

BC swamps Panthers

By Michael Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

On a rain-drenched ﬁeld last Saturday at
Boston College, the Pitt offense was splat-
tered by the Eagles, falling for the fourth con-
secutive game, 17-0.

In a game hailed as “Seasons on the Brink”
by the Big East Television Network, the Pitt
offense ﬁred blanks all aftemoon, totalling 94
yards, including a -11 yards rushing.

“This was not a very good ballgame,” Pitt
head coach Johnny Majors said.

The game started slowly as both offenses
appeared completely inept at moving the ball.
Both teams traded punts.

On Pitt’s second possession, after a holding
penalty and a Demetrius Harris self-recov-
ered fumble, Pitt faced a third-and-22 from
their own eight-yard line.

Not to the surprise of the Eagle defense,
Pitt called a draw play which failed when
Harris was unable to gain yardage.

Harris gained one yard on seven carries.

“Their defense can give you problems,”
Majors said '

On the following drive, Boston College
capitalized on the momentum. After a
lengthy drive, Boston College tailback Omari
Walker burstlthrough the middle of the Pitt
defensive line untouched for an eight-yard
touchdown run. Dan McGuire’s extra-point
gave BC a 7-0 lead with 2:40 left in the first
quarter.

Pitt opened its next series of downs at its
own‘ 30. After an offside penalty against the
Eagle defense, Pitt had its ﬁrst ﬁrst-down of
the ballgarne. With a series of John Ryan
completions to receivers Curtis Anderson,
Mark Butler and Vital Joseph, Pitt found
themselves in a ﬁrst-and-goal situation.

Volleyball
wins first
conference
battle

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

In its first bout against a confer-
ence foe, the Pitt volleyball team
beat Syracuse in four games last
Saturday, 9-15, 15-12, 15-2 and 15-
11.

“Syracuse is a very good team, we
were relieved to get the win,” coach
Cindy Alvear said.

After losing the first game, Alvear
decided to change the team’s look,
and replaced senior setter Stephanie

-Dufresne with freshman Tara

Haefner.

“We lost’ the first game with
Stephanie, so I decided to give them
a little jolt,” Alvear said. “I told
them, ‘I’m going to take away who
you know you can hit off of. Now
you have to do it on your own.”’

Both Haefner and the team
responded to the challenge, winning
the next three games. Haefner ended
with 38 assists.

Benefitting from the change were

who led- the Lady Panthers with 16
kills, a .237 hitting percentage and.

Ryan, who leads the Big East with 14 inter-
ceptions thrown, botched another Panther
scoring opportunity when he dropped back to
pass on a second—and—goal. After a fake draw
to Harris, Ryan found Matt Heff wide open in
the end zone. Unfortunately, Heff is a line-
backer for Boston College.

changed the game,” Majors said.

Boston College once again succeeded in
capturing momentum. A 41-yard ﬁeld goal

backs bounce off several Pitt tacklers for

“We probably killed ourselves in the ﬁrst
half, due to our alignments,” linebacker
David Sumner said. “We made some adjust-
ments for the secon .”

for the second half. After a sack by Jon

Tarara added 14 kills and led the
match for both teams with 20 digs.

“Tara is very emotional, the girls
respond well off of her,” Alvear said.
“After we knew we could win with
Tara, we played with a tremendous
amount of confidence.”

Although the team responded well
to this change, Alvear is still uncer-
tain about where the team stands.

“I was hoping by October we'd be
in a good rhythm, but that’s not
where we are,” she said.

The Lady Panthers have a home
match against Providence this Friday
night at 7:30 at the Field House.

BC backups

outrun Pi tf's

By Kevin Lilley

For The Pitt News

Boston College pitched a 17-0 shutout against the
Pitt Panthers this past Saturday, knocking Pitt down
to a 2-4 record and a tie for last in the Big East. The
Eagles did it without the big plays or special team
heroics that accounted for the previous losses; they
relied solely on a punishing running attack made up
of two second-string rushers. As for the Panthers,
their loss of Billy West had a much diﬁerent impact
on their running game.

The Panther defense came into Saturday’s contest
designed to stop the big play that has cost the team
its previous defeats. Chuck Dreisbach, Pitt’s defen-
sive coordinator, said in a pregame interview, “You
hate to say you’re going to take away your run sup-
port stuff, but sometimes you have to do that if
you’re giving up the deep ball.”

Thanks to this scheme, the Panthers stopped the
deep threat. What they didn’t stop was Omari
Walker, the Boston College backup "running back
who stepped in for Justice Smith and amassed 120
yards on 23 carries. He also scored untouched on an
eight-yard off-tackle run that typiﬁed the blocking
support he earned the entire game.

Adding to the BC rushing attack was Wa]ker’s
backup Mike Cloud, who ﬁrst began to see some
rushing action early in the second quarter. He
totaled 99 yards on 18 carries and also scored a
touchdown on an 11-yard sweep around the right
end

The Panthers-entered the game in a similar situa-
tion, starting Demetrius Harris in place of their
injured star Billy West. Harris, still nursing an
injured toe, was limited to one yard on seven carries
and left the game early due to his ailment. Smior

Flyers are tops

By Marc Rosenberg
For The Pitt News

After losing to New Jersey in
last season’s Eastern
Conference Final, the
Philadelphia F lyers are look-
ing to make a serious run for the
Stanley Cup this year. Although
the team still has a few ques-
tions on both offense and goal-
tending, Eric Lindros and com-
pany are ready to defend their
Atlantic Division Crown.

General Manager Bobby
Clarke felt the team needed to
make some improvements on
both offense and defense. They
did just that in signing former
Calgary center Joel Otto in the
offseason.,The ll-year defen-
sive forward should provide the
orange and black with some
more experience and hopefully
will take some pressure off the

“Legion of Doom” line. The -

front line blasted opponents last
season for 160 points in 38

games.

Although Clarke raised some

eyebrows by shipping 23-year-
old Dimitri Yuskevich off to
Toronto last month, he did steal
journeyman Kjell Samuelsson
from Pittsburgh over the sum-
mer. Playoff heroes Eric
Desjardins, Kevin Haller and
Karl Dykhuis all return this sea-
son. Clarke hopes Samuelsson
will bolster a Philadelphia
defense that was 18th last year
in penalty killing. Hopefully,
rookie Dan Kordic can make an
impact this year. The 6-5
defenseman added 30 more
pounds of muscle in the offsea-
son and is ready to rumble.
Goaltending, however, will
play a key role in Phi1adelphia’s
chances to make any run this
year. Ron Hextall looked great
last season, but that was last
year. At 31, Hextall’s days may
be numbered. The season could

ride on whether the nine—year _

veteran can harness the emotion
he carried last year and stay
focused between the pipes.

This could be the last shot in
the near future for the New

York Rangers to snag a Stanley
Cup. General Manager Neil
Smith made several changes,
including acquiring “Cool
Hand” Luc Robitaille and
defenseman Ulf Samuelsson
from Pittsburgh in exchange for
superstar defenseman Sergei
Zubov and 23-year-old Petr
Nedved. Other additions include
former Sabre Wayne Presley,
Islander canter Ray Ferraro, St.
Louis defenseman Doug Lidster
and, from across the river in
New Jersey, defenseman Bruce
Driver. The age factor could
play a problem, however. Other
than Robitaille, all of the afore-
mentioned players are over 31
years old.

The tea1n’s defense and goal-
tending remain relatively sharp.
Along with Brian Leetch and
Jeff Beukeboom, Samuelsson
and Lidster should solidify the
Ranger defense. Goaltenders
Mike Richter and Glenn Healy
should again provide solid goal-
tending as they have in the past.

This season is a critical one

 

The Pitt News, Monday, October 9, 1995

in Ilse Ailcmlic Division

for second-year head coach
Colin Campbell. Campbell, who
will be under the microscope,
needs to make sure his top per-
formers execute the way they
did two years ago. If the team
can recapture the magic of
1993-94, the Rangers will run
away with the cup this spring.
Although the Stanley Cup
champions New Jersey Devils
look as if they have a good shot
at defending their crown, it’s
going to be a tough road along
the way. However, when you’re
at the top, there is really
nowhere to go but down. For
the Devils, they only hope that
fall will be a short one.
Fortunately for New Jersey
coach Jacques Lemaire, few
changes were made in the off-
season. The team sent 1995
Conn Smythe MVP Claude
Lemieux to Colorado in a three-
way deal last week, getting for-
mer Isles winger Steve Thomas
in return. With the acquisition of
Thomas, it looks as if the Devils
won’t miss Lemieux much.

New Jersey shouldn’t worry
about the loss of defenseman
Bruce Driver either. The Devils
boast one of the best groups of
defensemen in the league. In
fact, due to the team’s plethora
of defensemen, future star Jason
Smith may start the season in
Albany.

The future couldn’t look any
brighter for the Washington
Capitals. The Caps have last
year’s Calder finalist in goal-
tender Jim Carey. The netmin—

. der was called up last season on

March 1st and turned ‘out an
2.13 goals against average in 28
games. ‘

Like New Jersey, Washington
is also solid on defense. The
Caps ﬁnally signed defenseman
Brendan Witt this past summer
after two years of negotiations.
The 6-2 rookie, who was the
team’s number one pick in
1993, is already being compared
to New J ersey’s Scott Stevens.

The Capitals could be better
off on the other side of the puck,
however. While they do possess
last year’s top scorer in Peter
Bondra, it pretty much stops
there. General Manager David
Poile traded left winger Dimitri
Kristich to Los Angeles in the
offseason for practically noth-

ing. Poile said it was the 29-

year-old’s attitude, not his
slump, that led to the trade.

Additionally, the Capitals lost
nine-year-veteran Michael
Pivonka and longtime veteran
Dave Poulin. Pivonka signed
with the Detroit Vipers of the
International Hockey League.
Poulin decided to hang up his
skates in exchange for the head
coaching job at his alma mater,
Notre Dame. The leadership of
the former Bruin and Flyer cap-
tain will be missed.

Whether the New York
Islanders will make the play-
offs or not remains a mystery.
Former ESPN analyst and
Boston Bruin head coach Mike
Milbury will take over behind
the bench this season. Milbury

McCray, BC was forced to punt Pitt rushed every-
body, and reserve fullback Kevin Romito nailed
BC punter Jason Malecki. The resulting 15-yard
penalty gave the ball back to the Eagles.

This time, BC was unable to capitalize on
Panther mistakes, as McGuire missed a 49-yard
ﬁeld—goal attempt

After some yawning, Ryan was roughed up, and
Pitt received a ﬁrst down on a 15-yard roughing-
the-passer penalty. Ryan then found Sadiq Durham
open for another apparent ﬁrst-down. But Durham
fumbled the ball, and the Eagles recovered. I

Boston College was forced to punt after another
Panther defensive stand. Durham redeemed himself
when he partially blocked McGuire’s punt with
4:15 left in the third quarter. It was his second
blocked punt of the year.

Faced with a ﬁrst-and-ten from midﬁeld, Pitt was
blessed with its best field possession of the day.
Much to the chagrin of Panther fans, Pitt gained no
yardage and was forced to punt again.

Pitt’s next possession started from its own 48-
yard line. After a sack, Pitt had to punt.

“Either team could have won this ballgame,”
Majors said. “We didn’t capitalize on our chances.”

With 11:10 remaining in the game, Boston
College embarked on what looked like the drive

that would put Pitt to rest peacefully. Pitt’s right
comerback, Anthony Dorsett, had different ideas.

Dorsett made an acrobatic interception in the end
zone, taking away any Eagle scoring threat.

After a holding penalty, Pitt faced a ﬁrst-and-25
from its own ﬁve—yard line. Ryan dropped back to
pass and was intercepted by Daryl Porter.

Shortly after that, BC running back Mike Cloud
went 15 yards, and the Eagles led 17-0 with 6:42
remaining.

Pete Gonzalez, who replaced Ryan for the sec-
ond time this season, followed in his teammates’
footsteps by tossing an interception of his own.

“To get a win when people think your on the way
downward is always good,” Eagles head coach
Dan Henning said. “It’s no good to continue the
way you were.”

Pitt falls to 2-4, with a 0-2 conference record.
This Saturday, Pitt travels to Philly to play the
Temple Owls. Kickoff is set for 6 p.m.

“The mood is still very positive,” Sumner said.
“We still played hard. We can win the rest of these
games.”

While there was once talk of a bowl game,
Majors might not have as much conﬁdence in the
Panthers as Sumner.

Majors said, “I’m sure Temple is thinking that
this is their best chance to win a conference game.”

Backups

°From page 7

Chris Patton stepped in, gaining just ﬁve yards on three canies.

Backup ﬁrllback Vince Williams got the call the most, carrying eight
times for 14 yards. Starting fullback Chris Schneider mustered negative
one yards rushing. Throw John Ryan’s sack total of -30 yards into the
mix, and the Panthers were left with -11 net yards rushing for the after-
noon.

The rushing problems also atiected the play calling, especially near
the goal line. When head coach Johrmy Majors was asked about the pass
play on second-and—goal that resulted in an interception, he explained
that it was the only alternative, that “all day our running game was just
basically nil  negligible.” He further said that “Boston College con-
trolled the ball too much” for the Panthers to win the ballgame.

That ball control came as a result of a very successful backﬁeld On
the 12-play, 72-yard drive that netted the Eagles a ﬁeld goal, nine of the
plays were runs, three of which were for 10 or more yards. In all, the
Eagles went three-and—out only three times the entire football game.

The Panthers, on the other hand, put together only four drives that last-
ed more than three plays and a punt. Seven drives lasted exactly that
long, and two others were out even shorter by interceptions. To make
matters worse, the two longest drives of the game were ended by costly
tumovers — one by Ryan’s goal—line interception and the other by a
Sadiq Durham fumble deep in BC tenitory.

Boston College head coach Dan Henning said after the game that “to
get a shutout for this defense was excellent.”

“We had no running game,” Majors said after the performance as an
explanation for the shutout, the short drives and the team’s fourth loss of
the season.

marching 61 yards to BC’s 4-

~ yard line in the second quarter,

Ryan faked a handoff and pro-
ceeded to ﬂoat a pass in the end
zone, right to the hands of
Eagle linebacker Matt Haff. Pitt
would never get that close
again. g _ V \

Despite being skunked for the
ﬁrst time since Notre Dame did
it in 1993, the Panthers still
managed to tally a handful of
impressive numbers.

Pitt’s offense notched an
astounding 94 total yards.
That’s 31 yards shy of BC’s
running back Omari Walker’s
game total. Consequently, the
Panthers hogged the possession
clock. Pitt had the ball for 22:34
of the game, as opposed to the
Eagles’ 37:26.

Pitt punted nine times, all of
which were successful, for 426
yards. BC punted seven times
for a measly 241 yards.

All in all, the two teams com-
bined for 397 yards. That’s only
50 yards short of what Pitt has
averaged for the year.

As you can see, this was
indeed a college football treat.

Sean Duncan is the managing
editor for The Pitt News.

Hockey

°Fr0m page 8

and Tommy Soderstrom were all unimpressive
last season. McClennan was sent down to the
minors last week. With Soderstrom’s lifelong his-
tory of heart trouble, he too is shaky. Salo, who
lost ﬁve games in six starts last season, may win
the job by default.

The Islanders can ﬁnally hold their heads high,
though, as Mike Milbury should permanently
guide this team in a direction it has not been in a
while — up._

The race for the playoffs is still on for the
NHL’s Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida
Panthers. Florida has missed the playoffs by one
point two years in a row. General Manager Bryan
Murray felt the only way to get his team over that
fine line was to get himself a new coach. Bye-
bye, Roger Neilson. Hello, Doug MacLean. Like

Murray, MacLean feels that a little youth can
make this team more successful.

Tampa Bay has never come close to a playoff
spot. This season, however, could be the one.
Thirty-year—old center Brian Bradley and goalie
Darren Puppa look to lead the Lightning in this
season’s playoffs. It can’t happen without them.

Moreover, they won’t have a prayer without
defenseman Roman Hamrlik. The number-one
pick in the 1992 draft is due for a breakout year.
In only his fourth season, he is close to blossom-
ing into one of the league’s best defensemen.

With Philadelphia, New Jersey and the Rangers
in the Atlantic, however, don’t look for the
Lightening or Florida to make the playoffs. The
“Thirtysomething” Rangers have too much talent
to play bad hockey. The increase of obstruction
penalty calls should not affect the Devils. Another
move by the Flyers General Manager Bob Clarke
will solidify Phi1ly’s reign in the Atlantic and,
possibly, a shot at the Stanley Cup.
