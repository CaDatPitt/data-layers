Seven Activist ‘Groups
Discuss Social Change

Seven activist groups will meet

‘ in room 524 SU at 7:30 tonight

in a coordinated effort to dis-
cuss “The New Movement for So-
cial Change.” The American
Friends Service Committee, in co-
operation with the Hill Education
Project, will bring spokesmen to-
gether in open panel discussion
from the following organizations:
CORE, SNCC, HEP, Students for
Peace, Students for a Democratic
Society, DuBoise Clubs, AFSC,
and, the Committee to End the

War in Vietnam.

These groups differ profoundly
in their areas of emphasis and.
in‘ their methods, but all have a
basic goal of social reform. The
purpose of the public blending
of these activist groups, said co-
ordinato-r Paul Le Blanc, is ‘to
“stimulate discussion and help
people’s' awareness of the real-
ities that we’re facing.”

IDEAS AND FIGURES

Ideas and Figures, magazine of
the Liberal Arts, invites all mem-
bers of the University community
to contribute short stories, art
work, poetry, essays and photo-
graphy for publication in the Jan-

5‘ 91..

guary viissue. If interested ’ ring »

When asked why the Society
for Conservative Studies had not
been represented in the group,
Le Blanc replied that the goals of
that society are not comparable
to the goals expressed by the
other organizations represented.
More programs of this nature are
planned for the future in this
"University and in others through-

‘ out the area.

Projected topics are: function
of a university, university reform
movement, and American labor
movements.

By DAN BOOKER 

Nineteen of the Studen
Government (SG) senator
missed the most excitin
meeting thus far in th’
Manning? administration. - 
bill urging removal of ‘th
out-of-state fee and a reduction
in out-of-state tuition ﬁnally pass]
ed the Senate but only after heat
ed discussion and personal hag‘
gling. '  "
Mainly because of sorority, an
fraternity rush, only 11 senator
attended Wednesday’s meeting
Since" no senator called for a
quorum, bills could, however,lbfi
considered. The senators present‘
plus a small audience, witnessed
Senator Ron Cowell introduce a
revised version of last weekls
measure on tuition reduction‘

drawn by Cowell after having
been attacked as a poorly d_raft5,-
ed piece of legislation.
The revised bill was introduced
by Cowell, along with Senators
Abe Singer and Jon Meyers;
While presenting the proposal;
Cowell was stopped twice
Vice-president Howard Ainismari
and warned to “keep discussion
germaine” and “leave personal‘-E
ities .out of your presentation.‘.’
Cowell had been defending the
bill he had withdrawn the pre-
vious week. He contended that
the bill had to be addressed tr!
the governor and state legisl
ture since they would have
provide money for any tuition
reduction for out-of-state stu-
dents. , T
During Cowell’s presentation”
Senator Loren Hershey, whol_1a_d
attacked Cowell’s bill, stated, 
this vengence?” Cowell’s heated
presentation also was interrupted;
when Sen. Singer declared, 
you want, I'll take my name off
the bill.” Finally, Senator Terry
Hyman congratulated Cowell fo,

   
   

 
    
   
 

  

Through this maze of backbit-‘-S
ing, Senator Dick Hulme com
mented, “It is irrelevant where:
the funds come from. What 
important is that the Senate take’
a stand on the issue and let-th
Chancellor ﬁnd funds to lowe
(out-of-state) tuition.” , 

,This position prevailed and the
bill was passed. One senate

    
   
      
 

 

    
   
      
  

   
 

    

  

        
     
 
  

   
  

the measure and voted “nay.”
Basil Zitelli felt that the state"
had no obligation to pay fo
reduction in tuition for out.’-o
state students. -

The bill provides for a petitio ,
to be circulated among stude 
during the next week. Thefpe‘

By ADRIENNE MILLER.

The Symphony is opening its
'",season with a salute to Virgil
Thomson on his 17th birthday
I with the composer’s Fantasy, his
~ . latest work. Thomson is spending
this year at Carnegie Tech as a
Mellon Professor.

In addition to teaching, he is
composing a new musical draina,
jointly commissioned by the Met-
" ropolitan Opera Company and the
V Koussivitsky Foundation. Thom-
son, formerly senior music critic
for the New York Herald Tri-
bune, describes Fantasy as “an,
offering of modern sounds and
,_ harmonies to the memory of Pur-

A. cell’s time, and to the. English

Baroque in general.”

It is impossible to predict how
future musicologists will View
Tnomson’s music, but future so-
ciologists may classify his opera
Four Saints in Three Acts with

. 'Hogarth’s painting “The Plow-
“man.” Written on a liberetto by
‘ Gertrude Stein and featuring an
.all Negro cast, Four Saints in
‘ Three Acts characterizes the Ne-

gro as a digniﬁed human being.

 

  

 

Following Fantasy is French
composer Arthur Honneger’s Sym-
phony No. 5. Honneger is best,
known for his orchestral, piece
Paciﬁc 231, a “tone portrait of a
locomotive.” The Fifth Symphony,
commissioned by the Koussevit-
sky Foundation was completed in
1950. It is an interesting and
'weil.constructed work.

Czechoslavakian pianist Hilde
Somer opens the latter half of
the program with Stravinsky’s.
second concerto, the Capriccio,,
which, according to Stravinsky’s
autobiography, was Written be-
cause he was sick of playing his
first. Capriccio, an extremely dif-
ﬁcult work, challenges both pi-

Oxford Grad

Receives
“Y” Position

As far as birth places go, Liv-
erpool is becoming as famous as
Brooklyn. The University YWCA
has recently acquired native Liv-
erpudlian, Catherine Briscoe, an
Oxford University graduate, to
become the new YWCA Campus
Director. .

Miss Briscoe, also starting this
term as a graduate student in
the School of Social Work, re-
cently left Canada where she
worked in a Toronto “Y” for the
past four years. Although her
college background centered
around social administration and
individual case work, she found
herself working with groups of
children, teenagers, young moth-
ers and adults.

The experience at the “Y” in-
terested her in social group work
and helped attract her to the
group work program of the GSSW.
For the next two years she will
be busily trying to do justice to
her classes and her job.

“Customs and student activ-
ities are to some extent quite
different,” _ said Miss Briscoe.
“when you compare English and
American universities. We did
not have “Y’s” at Oxford, and col-
lege classes were carried on with
a great deal of formality. Each
day we Wore robes to class.

that this discussion on the objec-
tives of an institute of higher

By ROBERT ZAVOS

Gertrude Stein is reported
to have said about the Oak-
land of the 30's: “Once you
get there, there’s no there
there.” Things haven’t changed
too much, at least for students
who brazenly venture into it
from the warm, moist protection
of the University campus. Oak-

_land just doesn’t offer much en-
tertainment for students.”

Fred Kahn, fourth year archi-
tecture student at Carnegie Tech,
and a small group of people
from the educational community,
are presently in the planning
stages of “a project to alleviate
the problem of where to go in
Pittsburgh to let loose, get tight,
and live in a Federico Fellini
world for a few hours.

The project is basically a club
for students from Pitt, Tech, and
Chatham. It will be located cen-
trally to the three campuses and
will be run by a committee of
faculty members and students
from the three schools.

According to Kahn, “the club
will be called ‘Zero for Conduct’

and will be primarily a diseothe-
que. We also plan to show under-
ground movies, have happenings,
and stage a lightworks.” Elabor-
ating further, Kahn said, “a
lightworks is a play of ﬁghting,
slides, movies and music design-
ed for experiment and entertain-
ing.

“We also, want to install in
special rooms a few pinball ma-
chines, a scopetone, a juke box,
and assorted home made devices.
Essentially, the club will be a.
place of constant change. The plan
will be ﬂexible; and self expres-

sion and experiment will be en-_

couraged. With strong student

support and a diversity of ideas
each weekend ‘Zero for Conduct’
will be a new experience,” re-
marked Kahn.

Students who are interested in
further information should con-
tact Kahn or Don Carter at 682-
8616.

In any one of these 44 offices therelare‘
usually three organizations which share one g

izations even have lights in their rooms; The
waste baskets remain unemptied for days at a

tions. ‘

place for women students to be working in late

Hall it is clear that this converted hotel is

We understand‘ that —mon-

and dormitories. The Univer-
sity is hindering a valuable
educational process. With
. less space provided there is
less opportunity for individ-

days the students have often
argued that we have no
voice in the course of devel-
V opment of the University.
The Student Union is an is-
sue which we can take into
our -own hands and work for
its solution. Yesterday, we
presented this University-
wide problem to Acting Chan-
cellor David H. Kurtzman. If

YOU HEARD it in dormi-
tories and private apart-
ments and fraternity houses
last ‘May. You heard it on
the streets and sidewalks
and you heard it across the
table in bars and restau-
rants.

YOU HEARD students
talking about beating the
draft by joining the nation-
al guard, by continuing on
the educational .nerry - go-
round in graduat- school, or
by being 50 pounds over-
weight in order to be classi-
ﬁed “4-F.” This talk was
everywhere and it wasn’t
only coming from “bearded
peaceniks.” It was coming
from the sons of war veter-
ans and the sons of low, mid-
dle and upperclass families.
But ._ their talk was notice-
ably hushed, perhaps for
fear of being branded unpa-
triotic, and from those hush-
ed voices came one unfalter-
ing theme: beat the draft.

But most of these students
were not draft dodgers, they

wanted to beat the draft so

they could stay out of Viet-

nam and the ugly war that is .

being fought there under the

. pretenses of being in the in-

terest of America’s national
security.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON
spoke to these students and
told them not to be disillu-
sioned by the difficulty of the
war. But they were not disil-
lusioned by his plea and
most important they were
not convinced that th e ir
country’s military actions in
the civil-war torn country
are justiﬁed or vital to
America’s national interest.
So this was the hidden
voice, the one that holds the

 

 

balance of public opinion. It
is the voice that agrees with
the super-patriots" in public
a.nd questions the U.S. poli-
cy in private, and it is the
voice that carries on a silent
debate in. the. conﬁnes of
one’s conscience. It is the
voice that begs to be heard
in public without fear of the
stigma that is attached to
people who harbor so-called
unpatriotic beliefs. _

These students were on
the horns of a dilemma. On
one side were the practical
issues and on the other side
the moral issues. Some slip-
ped through the horns and

some were caught. But stu-

dents are not the only ones
on the horns of a dilemma.

And furthermore, if you are
especially adept in a foreign
language, the National Security
Agency is ready to give

you immediate linguistic
assignments or may even train
you in an entirely new language.

Demonstrated ability in
language research can lead

to more complex and
sophisticated duties. The
systematic accumulation of
information, examination of
data and preparation of special
reports are important parts of
these assignments. And
scientiﬁc linguists will ﬁnd

~ nowhere else the opportunities

for practical applications of
their craft.

At NSA you will be joining
an Agency of national
prom_inence—a unique civilian
organization responsible for

what about the taste of Sprite? It's good. It's

Sprite is also very refreshing. "Tart and tingling,"

_ site of

Problem

The perrenial student problem,
“Where to park?” has now be-
come an acute faculty problem as

well. During late summer, when

campus construction went into
full swing, the University lost
more than 300 parking spaces.
The three largest unrestricted
lots—Y, across from Forbes Field,
the Common Facilies
Building; H, at the rear of Lang-
ley Hall, site of Stanton C. Craw-

New Project

To Aid Youth

The University YMCA will spon-1
sor the Red Triangle Project aim-
ed at developing the capacities
of children from underprivileged
neighborhoods. College and high
school students are wanted to
work with the youngsters.

The project will strive for mem-
t_al, recreational, and service im-
provement of. tutors as well as
tutees. Each student volunteer
will have the opportunity not
only to demonstrate his skills
and experiment with new tech-
niques, but also to help under-
privileged youngsters realize their
full potential.

The volunteers will team to-
gether with groups of about 10-15
children between 5-17 years of
age. The choice of the age group
will be left up to the preference
of the student volunteer.

The “target” children are rec-
ommended by school principals
on‘ the basis of their interest and
need for improving their capaci-
ties for academic skills and upon
the interest of their parents.

Each ‘group within the neigh-
borhood will function as a sep-
arate entity although inter-neigh-
borhood events will be planned.

Red Triangle Project will work
in cooperation with Neighborhood
Parent Councils, branch YMCA’s,
schools and school officials, block
clubs and VISTA Volunteers.

Also too emphasized by student
volunteers will be group partici-
pation and tooperation in rec-
reational activities and neighbor-
hood clean-up projects. V

Student volunteers should in-
dicate the time and day available
and youngsters will organize in
groups on that basis, although
Saturdays or weekdays after class-
es are suggested. The total num- _
ber of hours is left up to the
student leader and the group.

For further information, con- ’

tact the Pitt Y Corps Office, 212
SU.

Prevails  

. ford Hall; T, at Logan Armory,

side of the new Benedum Hall of
Engineering; and part of P, at
the Graduate School of Public
Health——-were closed to parking.

The night parking problem is.
even more serious, with less than
200 spaces available on the lower
campus. Big lots W, at the Mason-
ic Temple, and S, at Syria Mosque
are only available ‘during the day
to the University. At night these
are commercially run, and any
parker who stays overtime must
pay commercial prices.

The following lots on the low-
er campus remain unrestricted
for night parking: K, at Space Re-
search Coordination Center; M,
at Schenley Hal1;' HA, at Ruskin
Apartments; Q, at Forbes and
Craig; PL, at Prudential Life; SG,
at Schenley Garage; LG at Lang-
ley Garage; and A, at State Hall;

In an attempt to adjust the
number of assignments to the
number of available spaces, the
Security Department estimates
that they out each department,
division or office eligible for park-
ing spaces by 25 per cent. Des-
pite the general lack of space,
the Security Department has re-
ported very few violations. “We
allow a. -certain period of grace
during the first trimester to peo-
ple with third trimester stickers,”
Capt. Charles Ray explained. “A
few unstickered cars are being
towed, but very few.”

Until construction actually be-

gins in the Stanton C. Craw- .

ford Hall in the Langley Hot, H.
it is being used on a day to day
basis as an accommodation to
people assigned here last trimes-
ter and special cases approved by
the Security Department. This sit-
uation will be short-lived, how-
ever, and any day the “closed”
sign will go up.

 ‘Get the Bears’ Chant Trael1ingPnters

California Defense Poses Stiff Test
As James’ Boys Search For Gold

By GEORGE LIES

“California Dreaming,” won’t be the song on the lips of the Panthers‘ tomorrow
when they meet the University of California. It will be more like, “Get the Bear, get

the Bear.”

That was the theme song of practice this week. The offense sang it;. the defense
cried it out. Tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. (EDT), they will try to put words into action. D
And, riding the arm of quarterback Ed James, the Panthers may shoot down the

' Golden Bears. Ranked ninth over the country, James has completed 58% of his passes.

Last weekagainst Duke, James had plenty of time to select receivers, but it
may not be so tomorrow. “They’re awfully tough defensively,” head coach Dave Hart

said. Scouting coach Bill Lewis follows suit.

“California’s front four is big and strong,” he said, emphasising big and strong.

Lewis acclaimed Jim Fetherston, the Cal linebacker. “He pla

AND AGAIN’ Duke is thwarted. This time its safetyman Bobby Dyer.
On the last may of the ﬁrst half, Duke's Todd Orvald threw long to
split end Dave Dunaway, and Dyer broke up a sure touchdown. Inter-

ference was ruled against Dyer.

ys a flip-flop type of posi-
tion,” said Lewis. “He always
plays to the opponents’ strength.”
In two games, Fetherston was
credited with 42 individual tac-
kles and assists on tackles.

Although James may need to
work a little harder tomorrow,
his progress so far has been sur-
prising to Hart. “James has gone
beyond what we expected from
him.” James’ passing record
reads 30 completions in 52 at-
tempts for 342 yards.

Hart is hard pressed to ﬁnd
mistakes with James, but there
is one problem. Hart points out
that, “Eddie looks to Bob Longo
too much.”

For his performance last week
against Duke, Longo made -the
weekly All-East Team. Nationally,
he ranks third in total yardage
(254) and second in receptions
(19).

“Longo runs all the patterns
well,” Hart said, “but my only
worry is that he »isn’t catching
the bad passes good. A great
end’s gotta make a passer look
good.”

When James’ passes on the
rollout, however, Longo usually
is in the open. And not begrudg-
ing tight end Mickey Rosborough
any, James said, “I don't have a
chance to look to the other side
of the ﬁeld.”

After viewing game ﬁlms, Hart
also said he “found a good sopho-
more in (wingback) Skip Crszu-
la ',” who caught four passes for
83 yards against Duke. “In the
future we are going to run him
a little bit,” Hart said.

While practicing for this make
or break game, tailback Dewey
Chester tore ligaments in his leg
and did not go with the team. In
his place, fullback Joe Jones is
the probable starting tailback
with Mike Raklewicz at fullback.

DID, Lasers, Pikas Win
Fraternity B League Games

By DAN LICHENSTEIN
High scoring victories. paced action in fraternity B
League softball while all the dorm leagues ‘could offer for
the week were a couple of rained out games and a forfeit.

Among the fraternities, Delta
Iota Delta moved into ﬁrst place
with a 6-3 win over Phi Kappa
Theta as Lambda Sigma Rho
beat Theta Chi, 12-8, and Pi
Kappa Alpha crushed Phi Gam-
ma Delta, 9-1.

Poor base running in the ear-
ly innings and competent ﬁeld-
ing by the DIDs throughout the
game gave the win to the latter
team. The winners’ three runs in
the third inning broke a score-
less tie, and they held the lead \
for the rest of the game.

The Lasers’ 12 run attack was
the product of solid hitting and
poor Theta Chi ﬁelding. One
Theta Chi member said that his

‘team gave the game away, so

the true potential of the Lasers
remains unknown.

Pika pitcher Pete Demetski
held the  scoreless until the
ﬁfth inning while his own team

S was scoring at will. The high

spot for the winners was a four
run rally in the second inning as
Dave Sallach, with a two-run tri-
ple, led the attack. Sloppy ﬁeld-
ing by the losers was again a too
apparent aspect of a B League
game.

Mad House, thanks to a forfeit
by Litchﬁeld Manor on Tuesday,
has the opportunity to meet Ran-
dom in the semi-ﬁnals of dorm B
League play. -After their impres-
sive 9-5 Victory over Keystone
House, Random appears to be the
team to beat in the league.

‘In A League, Sutherland’s 15-3
win over a weak Panther House
makes them the power for the
present. They face the winner of
a Winbrook-Hawthom game, and
the subsequent winner will be
the heavy favorite to take the
league championship.

“We’re Only Number Two,” MSU;

Booters Travel There Tomorrow

MANNY RUSCHEINSKI
Spartan Halfback

  

and ‘Top Defender. .-

 

By MIKE BROURMAN

“Always a bridesmaid, and never a
bride,” is generally used in reference to
women. At Michigan State it is applied to
soccer. For the past two years, MSU has
been the bridesmaid in the, NCAA cham-
pionships, losing to Navy in 1964, and St.

Louis last year.

This year the Spartans are out to change all
that. And they think they have the material to
do it. The soccer team will be out to prove other-
wise tomorrow at MSU.

It may be a difficult task. In the ten years that
Michigan State has played soccer they have lost
only ten games. Furthermore, eight of these losses
have been to St. Louis.

This year the Spartans are determined to turn
in the bridesmaid gown. With nine returning let-
termcn and a host of promising newcomers, they
could do it.._ “This is more depth than we have

* ever had,” said coach Gene Kenney. “You can’t

reallysay that we will have a___starting 11. It will
  starting 14./,Il1“add,iAtii0l1_.-bﬁve or six

of these boys can play two or three different posi-
tions effectively.”

Sparking the Spartan attack will be All-Ameri-
can center-forward Guy Busch. Last year, as a
sophomore, he booted 24 goals, a MSU record.
Three other Spartan returnees earned All-Ameri-
can mention, fullback Terry Bidiak, halfback Peter
IV-lens, and halfback Manny Ruscheinski.

In addition, Kenney has two other starters
back, plus some outstanding sophomores, and a
transfer student from their nemisis, St. Louis.

But, if depth is Michigan State’s strongpoint,
it is also the booters’. Coach Leo Bemis is blessed
with a strong bench, which he has employed free-
ly thus far. Bemis points to ﬁve or six players he
can employ at various spots in the lineup.

Up front, he has used juniors Terry Weiler,
Gary Foertsch, and Shelton Zvoma to spell his
regulars. Foertsch has also been used at halfback,
along with junior Blaine Popp.

After the victory at Frostburg he said of them,
“I think our juniors, like Foertsch and Weiler
have improved 100 per cent over last year. They

, In one of the most profound
‘ decisions of this or any decade,
Tom “Alabama” Sacks has gone
against the Bear. Against the
Crimson Tide. “Alabama” has
"picked the Rebels of Mississippi
to whip Bear Bryant's factory.

“I’m trying to shake the ’Bama

place, it seems “Alabama” will
resort to heresy to get to the
leaders. .

the other hand, is so far behind

{J Philosophy S of ‘Science Series

 

   

Dr.ScrivenExposes‘Skeletons’

By JOSEPH A. DIVACK

Professor Michael Scriven of
Indiana» University was the ﬁrst
guest speaker of the year at the
lecture series sponsored annual-
ly by the Center for the Philoso-
phyof Science. Dr. Scriven’s lec-
tures carried the title “Skeletons
in the Scientiﬁc Closet; I. Value
Judgments in Science, and II. In-
sight and Understanding in Sci-

, ence.”

Monday night the speaker at-
tacked the notion that social sci-
ence should ideally be value-free.
Professor Scriven claims that not
only should values affect re-
search, in fact they must. He
went on to characterize the facts-
values distinction as a confusion.
Although Scriven recognizes some
difference between the two kinds
of language involved, he alleges
that we are able to proceed from
the vocabulary of description to
that of prescription via “plausi-
ble (though non-deductive) in-
ﬁuence.”

Professor Scriven’s general aim

. i in the lecture was “to provide

-» '\.
ei 

‘ \

   
  

‘ a sound understanding of val-

ue judgments, and to clear up
confusion concerning (their) re-
lation to science.” That a scienti-
ﬁc term is value-loaded, says Dr.

try major, will serve as Univer-

'sity editor. A former copy and
associate editor, Miss Rehns is a

Mortar Board, and member. of Pi.

 
  

Scriven, is in itself no cause for
alarm, since value judgments
have an indispensible function in
science. Alth ou g h emphasizing

the “messiness” of the entire is-‘

sue, the speaker attempted to
present a “more 'natural” classi-
ﬁcation of valu.e language, using
cases from economics.

Those who claim that value

‘judgments must be kept out of

social science usually cite as evi-
dence the alleged impossibility
of making scientiﬁc statements
including ethical terms. How-
ever, Dr. Scriven pointed out a
fallacy involved in this.

That social science should be

‘merely descriptive and not pre-

scriptive is completely “grotes-
que,” says Scriven. The social sci-
ences are in an excellent position
to make recommendations when
their descriptions are conjoined
with other data. In addition,
sometimes only the social sci-
ences can tell us how things
ought to be. Onelneed show only
that some set of value ‘claims is
true, not that it is right.

As an alternative to the usual
pyramidal mental picture of the
structure of valuation, Professor
Scriven offered a reticular model
which “stretches across the
ground of experience, tying ex-
perience together.” The mode1’s
looseness reﬂects the great com-
plexity of the.issue. .

The speaker stressed the nec-
essary inextricability of non-mor-
al value judgments with all sci-
ence. No exact qualitative meas-
ure of the worth of a theory is
possible, since evaluation must
play a role in the assignment of

"C Pittsburgh S
Will Host
Jazz Fest

Harold Betters, Johnny Costa,
Benny Benack and other well-,
known Pittsburgh jazz musicians

concert, titled “Jazz—Pittsburgh
Style.”

Phil Brooks will act as master
of ceremonies to these and other
artists, such as Joe Negi, Bobby
Negri, and Eric Kloss.

The Junior Section of the
Women's Club of Wilkinsburg is

burgh has produced such out-
standing artists” in the jazz ﬁeld.

Tickets for the show at Sol-
diers and Sailors Memorial Hall

Proﬁts from the concert will help

NIGHT SCHOOL
TECHNICAL STUDENTS

We are in touch with a number of
Pittsburgh area employers who frequently
express interest in hiring night school stu-
dents being educated in the technical ﬁeld.
These positions are full-time, and oﬂer
opportunities to acquire experience in the
student’s ﬁeld prior to the time he com-
pletes his education. Many companies offer
a school tuition aid program.

Metallurgical, Mechanical, Electrical,
Chemical and Civil Engineering students
are usually in some demand, and openings
often develop for Chemistry majors. A
number of positions exist for Draftsmen
and other men to function as Engineering
Assistants or Technicians. No fee of any
sort is charged until the time an applicant
actually receives _a job olfer and accepts
it. In the case of men who have already
acquired technical experience and are fairly
i well advanced toward their degree, our
service charge can sometimes be negotiated

with the ‘employer.

In the event no’ immediate opening
exists for a particular individual, his appli-
cation will be kept in our active files, at his
optionand without charge, until an appro-
priate job materializes. All applications are,
of course, kept conﬁdential.

YMCA Sponsors Workshop  

“Project , Amigos,” a summer
Mexico workcamp‘ project spon-_V
sored by the Pitt YMCA, will of-
fer University students an oppor-
tunity to help needy youngsters
in another country and at the
same time, beneﬁt from ﬁrst
hand experiences with people,
says Frank Watanabe, advisor to
the Y group.

From the end of April to mid-
June, University students will
work along with other Mexican
students, through the already
structured channels of the YMCA
of Mexico City and Torreon.
Some will teach swimming, crafts,
English or sports to the children.
As part of an effort to develop
the community, others may do

actual physical work such as
painting while others work in the
health departments or clinics.

“One of the objectives of ‘Pro-
ject Amigos,”’ stated Watanabe,
“is to help promote more interest
in Mexico at Pitt and to provide
programs and activities at Pitt
which will further general inter-
est there. Also, this project aims
at encouraging the means where-
by a greater inﬂux of Mexican
students to the Pittvcampus will
be possible and to generally fur-
ther better relations between the
U.S. and Mexico.”

Interested undergraduates,
graduate students, and faculty ad-
visors are encouraged to apply

in 212 SU or call ‘ext. 325. A

knowledge of the Spanish lan-
guage and previous experience
with young people would be help-
ful.

The experience to be gained,
by the student by working on
“Project Amigos” is invaluable to
him if he is interested in work-
ing with others and in further-
ing the understanding among
foreign countries.

To acquire preliminary experi-
ence, students may participate in
two of the Y-Corps’ current local
projects: Project Challenge and
Red Triangle Projects- Seminars
will begin in mid-October during
which participants will learn his-
torical and economic information
about Mexico and Latin America.
