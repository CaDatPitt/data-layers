PITT cmnmans EYE ursn 

OVER UNDEFEATED LIONS

By MYRON KOPELMAN

Penn State’s bowl-bound Lions will roll into Pitts-
burgh tonight to renew the biggest collegiate grid

rivalry in Pennsylvania.

They will be greeted by the news that tomorrow’s
game may be a sellout. At least 55,000 fans are expected
to jam the‘ Stadium, which holds 58,000.

Had the Athletic Oﬁice expected the surprise
rush for tickets, it would have arranged for several
thousand ﬁeld seats which would have been eaten
up by ducat seekers. Without these, the attendance
cannot possibly equal the 64,000 Notre Dame crowd._

Pitt’s 20-13 victory over Purdue, it appears, not
"only had the effect of skyrocketing the ticket sales, but
also has skyrocketed the hopes of Pitt fans for a win.

Panther partisans are turning psychologists in droves.
They will tell you that the ,Pitt team is reeking with

may prove more signiﬁcant than State’s cold, factual,

Of course, last year Pitt supporters said that they
would not surprised if the Panthers won, what with
the Lions not owning a victory over any foe of import-
ance and with the Pitts in a ﬁghting mood.

The ﬁnal score was 29-0 in favor of Penn State.

This season State includes the University of Penn-
sylvania among its victims. Although this has caused
the Pitt bandwagon to be less noisy, it is still highly

To University's.Bui|ding Fund

, United States Steel Corpora-
ion’s Pittsburgh subsidiaries add-
$300,000 to the University’s
owing building fund early this
eek.

Announcement of the contribu-
ion came from Alan M. Scaife,
hairman of the campaign execu-
ive committee. The gift is condi-
ional upon the cooperation of
ther major companies in and
around Pittsburgh with the build-
ing drive.

Campaign committeemen said
said that’ the $300,000 would be
put toward the construction of
two proposed buildings on the Ca-
zhedral campus -- the George H.
Zlapp Memorial Hall and the new

mately $6,200,000. Thie campaign
committee hopes to raise the full
amount through gifts from cor-
porations and business ﬁrms in
the Pittsburgh district.

Construction of the science hall
and the library have received top
priority from the building pro-
gram committee.

U. S. Steel’s gift is the second
from a large‘ corporation within
the past few weeks. Recently the
Corporation an-
nounced that it had given $200,-
000 to the building fund.

Helps‘ Assure Success

In releasing the news of the
steel company’s contribution, Mr.
Scaife said, “This pace—setting
contribution from the Pittsburgh
subsidiaries» of United States
Steel Corporation will help to as-
sure the success of Pitt’s plan to

  

provide adequate space for teach-
ing and research.”

Benjamin F. Fairless, president
of U. S. Steel, said that the gift
was made in consideration of the
fact that other companies in the
Pittsburgh area “are being solicit-
ed‘ for this vital purpose and are
responding in a generous man-
ner.”

He added, “Corporations and’
business ﬁrms depend upon the
University to provide, both
through graduates and through
special evening courses, the train-
ed manpower which is our most
valuable resource and to Carry
forward the" research our progress
demands?’

“United States Steel is happy to

have a part,in the University of

Pittsburgh’s’s vital_ program on

Obstacles to Overcome

Dr. Rufus H. Fitzgerald, Uni-
versity chancellor, acknowledged
the gift with the following state-
ment:

“Pitt has geared itself to be
helpful in every possible way to
business and industry in this area,
but our best efforts will not be
enough until the obstacle of space
and equipment is overcome.

“It is for this reason that Unit-
ed States Steel’s expression of
confidence is heartening to all of
us at the University.”

The total building program, an-
nounced last summer, calls for a
construction program costing $19,-
450,000. Included on the list are
several new medical structures.
athletic facilities, and a number
of buildings which will be used to

of the freshmen orientation per-
iod, highlights the work and pur-
pose of the guilds. Barbara Wolff,
guild chairman, will explain the
program and distribute brochures
listing the respective guild pas-
signments for each freshman coed.

Although the beginning of Guild
program officially marks the end
of the Mentor period, the ﬁnal
mentor meeting will be held for
freshmen during the week of
Nov. 22. ‘

Miss Wolff reminds freshmen
that their preferential choices
were the ﬁrst consideration in
making assignments. However,
correlation of the applicants’ free
hours with those of the guild ad-
visors may have caused some al-
terations in the assignments.

The Guild program was inaugu-

rated at Pitt some years ago by ~,

WSGA in an attempt to better
orient freshmen women to activ-
ities, and help them enter the
activity of their interest.

to all campus activities of major,
importance and are presided, over

    WORTH YOUR TROUBLE‘

At most large colleges there is some excuse for the stu-
dents being unacquainted with the president or chancellor. But
not here at Pitt.

Almost any day the students can see Chancellor Rufus
Fitzgerald——-walking through the halls, drinking coffee in the
Tuck Shop. And during the year a day is set aside for each class
so that the class members may meet, and talk with, the

chancellor. _
Next Monday Senior Court, sponsor of these “Open Hous-
4 es,” are inviting the University’s sophomores down to the chan-

ce1lor.’s office.

The Open House is scheduled for the entire afternoon on
Monday so that even the engineers up on the hill and the boys
at Ellsworth Center may have a chance to drop ‘in for a while.
, , There aren’t too many schools this size where the oﬁicials
would be interested enough to promote a program of this sort.
For a man as busy as the chancellor is at the present time
such a project entails a considerable investment of ‘time.

But,Dr. Fitzgerald considers it well wo'rth"‘his time. “We
think it would be well worth the students’ time, too.

 - r
 THE BEST MAN S HERE
 . Just recently some of the downtown sports reporters ini-
tiated a Frank Carver-for-Athletic Director boom in their
papers. The gist of their argument is that the athletic com-
, mittee would go a long way before it found a man better liked,
% C more respected, or as able. - ‘ '
‘ « '* We don’t know how closely the athletic committee is heark-
ening to the sports writers’ printed musings. We don’t even
know whether Frank is particularly interested in the job. .
But if he is interested, or if he can be persuaded to take
- the Athletic Director’s post permanently, we’re all for it.
‘ There isn’t any person inside or outside the University
that is better acquainted with the athletic situation than Frank.
There isn’t anyone who commands the respect from outsiders
dealing with the school that Frank does. _
All through the recent athletic investigations and upheavals
he is the one man who remained untouched by blame. .
Perhaps the athletic committee feels that it wants a man
who has no connection with the recent athletic past.
But competence to handle the job should be the ﬁrst con-
sideration. On that basis Frank would be at the top of the list.

By LES GALLAGHER

Last year, there was an election
to vote in the new members of
Studentcongress. I was nomi-
nated by one of the little political
cliques here at the University to
represent their interests. A sin-
gular honor and one of which I
was duly proud. The day of elec-
tion dawned clear and bright and

the voters trooped to the eighth
ﬂoor to cast their greasy little bal-
lots. Because of the voters’ stupid-
ity and my own likeable personal-
ity I was defeated. The nights
have been long and many and my
days ﬁlled with sorrow and shame
since I failed to accomplish that
greatest of all desires of any Pitt
student; since I failed to become
elected to that glorious and noble
character builder of college man-
hood, the Student Congress.

How I would have loved to have
had a consenting or dissenting
voice in the government which
shapes and moulds the paths of the
student here at the University.
The glow in my heart would have
been good and ﬁne to feel that I
was a representative voice of the
people. But instead my soul is
empty and a dull ache visits my
mind when I think back over all
of the miraculous changes insti-

tuted by the present Student Con- ~

gress of which I might have been
a noble part had I not been de-
feated.

The Frustration of HHAH

It is a fearful frustration to come ~

so close to greatness and live to see
it slip from your grasp. Oh, pagan
gods of the southern Orient, how
grand it would ‘have been to sit in
on the parliamentary procedure
which fought so valiantly to have
placed in the men’s lavatories the
necessary and . needed, modern
convenience called the coat hang-
er. Whether the coat hanger
amendment succeeded or failed is
not for us gathered here to decide.
It is the thought behind these
thinking men of Student Congress

.which we must praise. The inter-

est of you little students is next to
their heart, and rain nor snow nor
howling gale shall stay"them from
such meritorious service.

To tell the truth I’m not sure

whether it was this year’s Student '

Congress or last year’s which fear-
lessly tackled the coat’ hanger
problem but it makes no differ-
ence because gentle reader, it is
through such vital issues as this,
we are able to see the important
work being fostered by the afore-
mentioned group.

Another item worth a bit of
mention is the West Virginia rally
sponsored‘ by this year’s incum-
bents. This truly democratic or-
ganization, this ﬁne representative
body, sensing the will of the peo-
ple, the demands of the populace,
held a hurried victory _rally. Sol-
diers and Sailors Hall was ar-
ranged for, coaches and players
were rounded together, band mu-
sic supplied, mimeographed sheets
proclaimed the time and place and
a couple of hundred students at-
tended the dismal ﬂop.

All for Naughf

All of these hurriedly laid plans
went awry because a representa-
tive government answered the
voice of the people; the voice of
the people happened to be about
twelve jibbering idiots yelling
around the Commons Room for the
want of something better to do.
But readers of mine, no matter if
the members of Congress got the
greatest idea of the century it
wouldn’t do any good. Student
support and the university ad-
ministration would make them go
back to playing with coat hangers.
So, since it is impossible for Stu-
dent Congress to accomplish any-
thing, why not pay them and make
them real politicians.

Dear Progressive Party: That
slobby little mimeographed sheet
that you passed around the other
day, decrying the tuition raise,
pulls you down from your ques-

tionable status as a political party

to the level of a smelly, little rab-
ble-rousing mob. Please, Progres-
sives stay as sweet as you are,
you’re still good for laughs; 'don’t

Russell Smith
Art on Display

An exhibit of the work of the
late Russell Smith, a Pennsylva-
nia artist.of the 19th century, is
on display in the Fine Arts gal-

Heinz Chapel Passes

Decade of I

Heinz Memorial Chapel marks

nspiration

its ﬁrst decade tomorrow.

Ten years ago on Nov. 20, the chapel was dedicated to supply the
spiritual growth which, with intellectual growth, is education. A
It is the product of Henry John Heinz’ bequest to have a Univer-

sity building erected in honor of h

is mother.

6

Henry John Heinz’s childreh must have caught his sentiment, for

when the cornerstone was-« laid, it
both Mr. Heinz and his mother;

was for a building dedicated to

through the children’s addition to
the bequest.

Architecturally the Chapel is
based -on medieval French Gothic
and is built in such a way as to
suggest height.

Architect Charles Z. Klauder
planned the building in Indiana
limestone. It is as structurally
perfect as it is imposing and in-
spiring.

Incorporated in the outer struc-
ture of the Chapel are the seals of
European and American universi-
ties in the order of theirifounding,
centered by the lighted candle and
three rivers of the University of
Pittsburgh.

This is in keeping with the
Chapel’s dedication to the spiritual
values in education. ‘

Inside the Chapel are shields of
religious ﬁgures and events in the
Old and New Testaments along
with those representing the beati-
tudes and the seven liberal arts.

The stained glass windows are
unique in the fact that all 23 of
them were designed and executed

High Number  
0f Teachers
Paced in Jobs

Ninety-ﬁve per cent of last
year’s graduates of the School of
Education who made use of the
Teacher Placement Bureau were
placed in teaching positions.

This was revealed yesterday by
ﬁgures released by the bureau, di-
rected by George W. Hoffman.

Of a total of 225 education grad-
uates last spring, 130 were avail-
able for teacher placement, and of
these, 124 have already been
placed. From this number, 33 posi-
tions in elementary grades were
ﬁlled. The remaining placeements
were in secondary education, in-
cluding social studies, English,
Spanish, Latin, French, sciences,
speech, geography, and commer-
cial and physical education.

Ninety—ﬁve graduates were not
available for placement. Of this
number 44 were already teaching,
18 accepted work in the business
and industrial ﬁeld, and 14 en-
tered graduate school.

Three graduates were restricted
to their home area, nine got mar-
ried, and ﬁve did not intend to
teach.

The bureau had also prepared a
list of teaching vacancies reported
for 1948. A total of 1,355 vacan-
cies existed. Of this number, 271
were out of state and 157 were out
of the country.

Scrimmages
Out As Oops  
Guard Field

By BOB VAN ATTA

Precautions of all sorts were
taken this week at Pitt Panther
practice sessions within the semi-
privacy of the canvas-shrouded
practice ﬁeld.

Scrimmages were ruled out by
head mentor Mike Milligan to
guard against further injuries to
key personnel. Trainer Howard
Waite forbid practice for a num-
ber of linemen who are recuperat-
ing from a variety of hurts.

Two uniformed policemen kept
stragglers and visitors from any
interference with last-minute
strategy designed to surprise Penn
State tomorrow.

Bob Plotz' may miss the game
tomorrow. His knee has been re-
sponding slowly since it was in-

jured in the Ohio State slaughter. '

Wib Forsythe,’who started against
Purdue, will probably open at
right tackle again.
Coleman Doubtful

Ralph Coleman, another right
tackle is on the doubtful list.
Bernie Barkouskie and Mike Bol-
din, guards, are expected to be
ready. Jack Smodic, sidelined
since the (Western Reserve game,
will see action on pass defense.

Nine seniors will be in their ﬁnal
game for Panthers. Captain Bill
McPeak and Leo Skladany, ends;
Wib Forsythe and Ralph Coleman,
tackles; Don Fisher, center; Walt
Cummins and Pete Fuderich,
quarterbacks; and Jack Smodic
and Tony DiMatteo, halfbacks, are
bowing out. -

DiMatteo will be unable to play,
having joined Bill Bruno and Tony

Razzano on the “out-for-the—sea-'

son” list some time ago.
Panthers Leave Town

Two items receidéd a major
share of practice time. First was
the addition of attack versatility
that could gain against the im-
proving defense of the Nittany
Lions. 4'

Another, the erratic pass defense
the Panthers have shown, is of
primary concern since the Pitts
have seen Petchell perform in pre-
vious Pitt-State games.

Mike Milligan will take the Pan-
ther squad out of town tonight for

"rest and seclusion before return-

ing shortly before game-time.

Tuesday at Pitt Stadium,
afternoon’s Victor.
Based on past performances,
the Locals will enter the Pitt play-
off decided favorites.

Resistance Tough

Encountering more resistance
than they expected the Indepen-
dent titlists barely edged the sur-
prisingly t o u g h Professional
league entry Wednesday.

On the opening kickoff, Bob
Wicks, displaying the great run-
ning form which has sparked the
Locals all season, took the ball on
his own 15 and raced 65 yards for
a score. A Bob Badke-to-Gene
Gaugler pass early in the second
period gave the victors their sec-
ond touchdown.

Psi Omega came to life after
that score and battled on even
terms the rest of the game. Joe
Stewart passed to Bud Remaley to
climax a long drive just before
the half ended.

Both Teams Threaten

Both teams made scoring threats
in the second half but were un-
able to cross the goalline. The los-
ers were thwarted in the last
minute when Wicks intercepted a
long desperation pass.

In games last Tuesday, the L0-
cals defended their Independent
championship successfully, roll-
ing to an easy 46-0 win over the
YMCA, and the Psi Omegas up-
set the favored Resistance Block,
24-7.

Wicks again led his team, scor-
ing three times, but had to share
honors with Tommy Carr, who al-
so made three TD’s. The blonde-
haired Wicks tallied on scoring
jaunts of 35, 80, and 45 yards.

' Champs Block Superbly

Superb blocking by the champs
was best exhibited when Wicks
went the distance on the second-
half kickoff while his teammates
mowed down the opposition in
front.

Joe Stewart was the big gun in
the Omega victory, tossing three
touchdown ae‘ria1s, two of them
to Remaley, who scored a third

time on a pass from Dick Bar-
rickman. .

‘Mums‘ in Fall Flower‘ Show
Even Watch Football Game

By BILL SCRIVO
Mum’s the word at the ﬂower

' show.

Our neighbors who shouldn’t
throw stones — Phipps Conserva-
tory’s ﬂower experts—have pro-

. duced for their Fall ﬂower show

 

   
 

an interesting cafe-style display of
seasonable chrysanthemums.

If you should -happen to mean-
der, between now and Nov. 29,
across the hollow to the house of
glass, and you should, you will see
a variety of lovely “mums” bloom-
ing under the joint auspices of the

. city and the Pittsburgh Horticul-

tural Society.

To a program of dinner music
you can wander past many “mum”
sets~that are beautifully arranged
andprainbowed with color.

The petal-pushers have tacked
names on some of their display
pieces. Some of the cognomens,
such as Anaconda, do not seem to
apply to “mums,” but nevertheless
there_ they are.

Others includedin the show are
the yellow Oakwan, the maroon
Garnet King, and the white Silver
Lace and Frieda.

‘By far the most ingenious of the
displays is the football ﬁeld.

It features a turf of yellow

L

“mums,” yard-lines of white, a
large yellow “mum” football with
bronze laces and seams, and a host
of “mum” rosters. At the ends of
the ﬁeld pennants of Pitt, Tech,
Duquesne, and the Steelers are
hung on goalposts.

The football is no ordinary pig’s
hide. It was made by covering an
oval trame with damp moss and
pushing cut “mums” in the right
places.

A Pilgrim house and garden is
also included in the show. The
garden, beside being full of
“mums,” sports a wild turkey, a
squirrel, John with blunderbuss
attached, and Priscilla. The dis-
play commemorates Thanksgiving,
no doubt.

There are the usual ponds and
manila hemp—framed groves, ﬁlled

In fact the only aliens seem to be
those aristocrats of the conserva-
