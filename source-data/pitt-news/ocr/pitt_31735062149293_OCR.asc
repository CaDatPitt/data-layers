Delegates Vote Censure
Of Administration
Control, Hearst

By James Donoghue

In a series of resolutions adopted at
the Spring Convention held last week-
end at the University of Delaware, the
Intercollegiate Newspaper Association
went on record as condemning compul-
sory military training in land-grant
colleges, suppression of academic free-
dom, administration control of student
publications, and the “policies and
tactics” of William Randolph Hearst.

In condemning compulsory military
training the resolution stated that the
ROTC is “guilty of romanticizing the
horrors of war under a blanket of mili-
tary tactics, and keeping alive in the
minds of youth an anticipation for war
and a willingness“-to undertake organ-
ized warfare.” The'res_olut_ion further.
expressed approval of the'Nye-Kvale
Act‘, which is designed to lift the com-
pulsory military training classes in the
land-grant colleges. Immediate pass-
age of the act was urged, and copy of
the resolution forwarded to Congress.

The INA also went on record as ad-
vocating “academic freedom and de--
ploring student suppression in the uni-
versities of the United States. It
also charged that “numerous univer-
sities may be openly cited as places
which illegalize or refuse recognition
to student organizations because they
dare stand for academic freedom and
other liberal student interests.”

In line with the above resolution an-
other was adopted which recommend-
ed that ~the “editorial policy of the
member papers
their respective
tions.”

The convention next went on record
as being in favor of an investigating
committee being set up to interrogate
the possibilities of affiliation‘ with the
American Newspaper Guild.

A resolution was unanimously adopt-
ed by the delegates condemning Wil-

Students who have had no experi-
ence in the “African=Dodge-ball” game
will scurry for cover or rush to take
a few lessons in this side-show pas-
time when they hear the opening shot
of the Senior Ball “barkers” today
with the announcement that Charles
Ebert, Jr., chairman, is hot on the
trail of one Sammy Kaye or Tommy
Tucker. -

Either gentleman would provide any
Senior Ball cannon with a hefty wad
of gun-powder that would make
“dodging” well-nigh impossible. At
least so claims Ebert.

Tucker and Kaye, national band
leaders, were selected by the seniors
as the most popular choices for the
Ball.

At today’s committee meeting,
Ebert plans to organize the 23 com-
mitteemen into groups that will start
functioning immediately by making
deﬁnite plans for the Ball.

Appointments which will be made
oﬁicial at that time are: W’illiam
Hughes, chairman of publicity;

Charles Herald, ticket chairman; Mar-
garet Speer, chairman of decorations;
Frances Goodwin, chairman of pro-
grams and favors; George Harris-,
chairman of invitations; and Mar-
garet Lewis, orchestra chairman.

‘Working under Hughes are: Charles
Allcroft, Fred Edwards, Harry Robin-
son, and Morris Rosenbloom_ Assist-
ing Herald on the ticket committee
are: James Nicholas and Roberta
Nern.

Sidney Friedman, Joe Madden, and
0. Duncan Montgomery aid Miss
Speer with the decorations. Marie
Bryan and Eleanor Brown assist Miss
Goodwin in the selection of programs
and favors. Harris works with Jack
Bodkin and Anne June Elmer on the
invitations committee.

Maurice Fierman and Ed Durkin
aid Miss Lewis in the ﬁnal selection
of the orchestra. Today’s committee
meeting will be held in Room 821,
Cathedral, at 3 o’clock.

Social Aﬁairs Enliven
Week-End Parley ;
In Delaware 9

By William K. Trosen
Newark, Delaware—a little college‘
town of some 5,000 residents, where
we really know for a fact that the
streets are deserted at night—-—was the
1936 spring convention site of the In-
tercolleg'ate Newspaper Association.
It was also the site of a series of good
times for three “News” sports1ne_n,who
attended the convention. It wasalso
a “site.”
It’s a beautiful little col1ege—one
that reminds you of one you’ve seen
somewhere in the movies,

It was in Chambersburg that we stop-
ped for something to eat. ' 'We"sat
down at a clean little hotel table and
ordered up. The waitress asks, “How
do you want your steak?” and we
answer “In Ben Bernie style.” She
quivers, “How’s that?” and we say,
“Well done, my lads, well done.” We
certainly were feeling chip-pery that
day. .

One, of us didn’t like "Ben Bernie”
steaks so he outs and orders a “cir-
cus fortune teller.” Well, that sort of
stops the waitress until she under-
stands that the steak is wanted “me-
dium.”

In Newark at last, we stop off at
the Theta Chi house. It was 2 o’clock
in the morning but we found two
brothers up and about. One was ‘_a
darned nice fellow but the other
wouldn’t even move his eyelids in
greeting. .He stayed where. he was
ﬂopped on the couch and allowed the
other brother to entertain us. We
guessed afterward that the couch-
stricken one must have gone inactivée.

VVe learn here that there are 700 
dents at the university—and that the

‘girls’ a.nd boys’ colleges are separate

schools. «
Leaving the Theta Chis, we move
about to ﬁnd a place to sleep for the
night. We enter one of the two hotels
in ‘town, turn the lights on, and then

Playe rs-Announce
‘No Performance’

For ‘Cock Robin’

Pitt Players will not produce “Cock
Robin” this year.

The announcement came yesterday
from Carl B. Cass, faculty director of
Players. Cancellation was decided on
because the Community Playhouse,
where the performance was to be
given, was not available on a favora-
ble date, and because there was in-
sufficient time left before the close
of school for rehearsals.

First scheduled for March 18 and
19, the show was postponed until May
because of the ﬂood.

A reimbursement of 25 cents to
those who hold season tickets will be
made by Miss Mary Milburn, dean
of men’s office, this afternoon and Fri-
day from 2 to 5 o’clock. Refunds may
also be obtained from Eugene Cohen,
C36, and Jack Levin, BA39.

Pitt Players are planning to pre-
sent “Cock Robin” next fall in the
Stephen Foster Memorial.

‘Jobs’ Discussion

Education Head Of Westinghouse
Speaks Tonight In Cathedral

“Jobs” will be discussed this eve-
ning by Carl S. Coler of Westing-
house Electric Company, at a meeting
of Pitt Business Institute, student-
faculty organization of the School of
Business Administration. The meet-
ing will be held in Room 1309, Cathe-
dral at 8 o’clock.

Mr. Coler will discuss the subject of
jobs in relation to the student, the
country as a whole, a.nd to the elec-
trical industry. An open forum will
follow. .

Mr. Coler is in charge of the Pitt-

Westinghouse graduate cooperative
program. He graduated from Cornell
University, College of Engineering,
and then completed a graduate stu-
dent course of the Westinghouse Com-
pany, specializing in the ﬁeld of works
management. Since 1919, Mr. Coler
has been in charge of the Educational
Department of the company and the
president of the Westinghouse Tech-
nical Night School. His present posi-
tion is that of manager of office em-
ployment and training. He is a mem-
ber of the faculty of the University,
conducting a course in Personnell Ad-
ministration in the Downtown Divi-
sion, .

tion of officers for 1936-1937. Re-
freshments will conclude the meeting

ent school year.

Senior Announcements

Orders for senior announcements
should be placed at once, says Alfred
Dixon, C36, chairman of announce-
ments, if these orders are to be ade-
quately and quickly ﬁlled.

Sample covers are on exhibit on all
University bulletin boards. They are
available either with blue leather or
white cardboard covers. The leather
books are priced at 35 cents, and the

Hockensmith, McLeod
Elected Alumni Trustees

 

Wilbur D. Hockensmith, ’01.
and Norman MacLeod, ’17, were
elected to the University Board of
Trustees in the ﬁrst alumni elec-
tion of trustees in University his-
tory. Results of the mail election,
revealed Monday night, showed
Hockensmith leading the ﬁeld of
four candidates with 2,035 votes,

MacLeod drew 1,913 votes to give
him a wide margin for the second
position over Vvilliam S. Rial, with
1,281, and John R, Thompson, with
955. A “liberal” write-in slate, list-
ing the names of Al Tronzo and Dr.
John J. McLean, gathered only 701
votes for both candidates together.
More than 100 scattering votes
were also recorded in the election.

Barton Forecasts
More Employment

Placement Head Warns Graduates
To Avoid August Job Seeking

Graduates of colleges and univer-
sities will ﬁnd positions easier to get
this year, according to J. Clyde Bar-
ton, director of the University‘ Place-
ment Bureau, but they should shy
from seeking work in August. The de-
mand is greater for all types of grad-
uates this year, Barton says, and the
demand has been quite steady except
for the month of August,

The number of large companies who
have, through personal interviews and
letters, contacted University seniors
this year is three times greater than
it was last year, and 21 times greater
than in 1934, Barton indicates. So far
this year more than 40 companies
have interviewed University seniors,
and 25 companies have asked for
recommendations by mail.

Forty per cent‘ of this yea.r’s seniors
in engineering at the University have
already been placed, and Barton be-
lieves that before commencement in
June more than 80 per cent will have
been employed. The greatest number
of opportunities seem to come from
coinpanies looking forengineers with
technical training. The next in line
require a business training, especially
in sales. After that, those with train-
ing in accounting and general office
work have the best opportunities. But
the demand for college graduates with
various types of training is greater
than it has been in years, Barton
states.

Salaries being offered Pitt seniors
have been increased from 25 to.33 1/3
per cent. This, however, is only true
in the lower bracket. Salaries in the
upper bracket have not moved up to
any extent, Barton says.

Talkies ill End
Fine Arts Survey
0fAmerican Film

A program representative of the
talkies ends the series of “A Short
Survey of the Film in.America” which
the Fine Arts department sponsored
this semester. Including such hits as
“The Jazz Singer,” “All Quiet on the
Western Front,,” and “Steamboat Wil-
lie,” a. Mickey Mouse comedy, the
movies will be shown Monday evening
at 8:15 o’clock in the Falk School
Auditorium.

Tickets to this screen ﬁesta are
available today in the ﬁne arts office,
Room 109, State Hall.

An excerpt from “The Jazz Singer,”
the Al Jolson hit which is held re-
sponsible for the sudden spread of
sound pictures, will be shown.

“All Quiet on the Western Front”
includes in its cast such notables as
Louis Vvolheim, Lew Ayres, Slim Sum-
merville, and Beryl Mercer. This
present version contains only nine of
the original thirteen reels, but it is
as harrowing and contains as much
emotional intensity as did its prede-
cessor.

“Steamboat Willie” is the ﬁrst
Mickey Mouse to be shown publicly.

In addition to these the program
also includes a newsreel featuring
George Bernard Shaw, Mussolini, and
“Big Bill’ Tilden.

‘Back To Nature’ Movement Invades

Pages In May

With a green and yellow cover, a
set of articles on everything from fan-
dancers to the VVPA, sentimental
odes to spring, and the usual works
of art by the staff cartoonist, the
Panther is again being hawked from
hallways and street corners today.

Catching the spirit of the season,
two freshman nature lovers unburden
their souls and write of the beauties
of the waking year. One of these,
“Sog of Sprig” by Sam Williams,
treats the delicate subject of romance
in the spring, and a walk in Schenley
Park. Then there is a poem inspired
again by budding trees and blooming
ﬂowers, composed by William Murray.

Murray goes off on another tangent
with an article in defense of Sally
Rand. It all has to do with the re-
fusal of the dancer to_attend_a tea

Number Of Panther

party held by the fan dancers’ union,
and the subsequent picketing.

The fast-working WPA workers are
the subject of a satirical discussion
by Karl Punzak. He calls it “There’s
the Rub,” and comments on the Me-
morial Hall cleaning job.

Another freshman adds a psycholv
ogical touch to the spring fantasy edi-
tion. IHe’s Milton Lehman, who writes
the life history of a string-saver in a
story called “Insigniﬁcant Obsession,”

There is also a feminine touch to
the magazine, supplied by Irene Mat-
veak. -It is “A Key, a Watch Chain,
and You," and deals with the big cam-
pus activities men.

All the rest of the monthly features
are printed, including the snooping
Panther Prowler, Who’s Who, andthe
original and exchange jokes. ,

Education In Society

ISTORY BOOKS for centuries have pointed with a
H knowing ﬁnger at the new developments, new dis-
coveries, new inventions, new techniques; and science
has gone striding along toward civilization. But look
about you now and see how crippled are the legs Of
science with the crutches of a political system extend-
ing from Fascism to Communism with Democracy in the
middle, an economic system which plows under grain
when people are without bread, a soci-al system which
has lined up in a battle of two classes. This, your
teacher tells you, is what is known as a cultural “lag.”

The reason for this cultural “lag," we say, rests with
the school. The school, which was created to build so-
ciety_ andcivilization, has cut itself off from society. .It
has been content to transmit a body of doctrines and
ideas. handed down in straight-jackets from generation
to generation while the changing needs of society go un-
answered. It has been content to teach the Classics. and
a military-conscious history and the philosophy of the
ancients and the general interpretation of the “liberal
arts" as a body of knowledge designed to educate one
away from the common man and common society. It
has been content to leave. to chance and to the individ-
ual the achievement of its greatest purpose: an an-
swer to the present-day needs of society.

But the school must get back into motion. If unheed-
ed, the cultural “lag” (a lag not in ancient culture, but
in the modern socio-economic set-up) may operate as
fatal to our society now highly specialized as to its mal-
distribution of living necessities, highly scientiﬁc as to
its poisonous gases.

The Progressive Education Association, which will
hold its regional conference at the. Fort Pitt Hotel May
8. and 9, is a. step in the right direction. “The School
and the Problems of the Community” is to be the sub-
ject of the conference.

The various topics to be considered speak more spe-

ciﬁcally of a sincere attempt to face the problems of
today: “Our Joint Responsibility to Youth,” “The
Teacher as a Citizen," “Shall Teachers Indoctrinate?"
“Must Teachers Take Sides on Socio-Economic Issues?”
“Relating the Subjects to the Contemporary Social
Scene,” “The Handling of Controversial Issues in the
Classroom.” “Social Development and Character Building
in the Rural School," “The Progressive Curriculum,"
“The Challenge of the New Education," “Education and
Freedom."
p We suggest that you visit the Progressive Education
Conference to learn about some of the things which
might well be included in every student’s curriculum.——

l Among The Faculty

By Sally Beloastro

DR. JOHN OLIVER, head of the department of history
. comes from a. farm that has been called home by
six generations of Olivers since 1810 . . He attended
a country school in his early childhood . . . from there
he went to the Military Academy in Jackson, Missouri,
then to the Missouri State Teachers’ College . . . While
he attended this institution he won practically all the
medals that were offered—in debating, oratory, and dec-
lamation . . He taught history, and at the same time
coached basketball for three years at Bonne Terre in
east Missouri . . Went to Missouri University, where
he was tapped into Phi Beta Kappa . Dr. Oliver
is going back there this summer to teach a course, The
History of American Science and Technology . . He
developed this course himself and it has been recognized
by three large universities.

Dr. Oliver took his AB and his BS in education at
Missouri and won a scholarship in history . . After
receiving his Master's degree, he stayed as a graduate
assistant . . . At the end of one year he went to Wis-
cousin, where he received the American History Fellow-
ship and a PhD besides . . . His ﬁrst position following
the acquisition of his PhD was offered him by the Indiana
State Historical Society . . . After working as an assist-
ant director for this society, he returned to the Wis-
consin history staff.

His career was interrupted by the call of war in 1918

. Despite the fact that he received an officer’s com-
mission at Camp Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, he did
not go across.

He came to the University of Pittsburgh in 1923 and
has been here ever since . . His interests are of a
various assortment . . While in school he spent two
years in the University ba.nd as a clarinet player .

He was assistant manager of the school paper.

Farming and ﬁshing are his two big interests . . . He
is also fond of traveling . . Has been to Europe sev-
eral times . . . Prefers Scotland because of his Scotch
ancestry and Switzerland for her beautiful mountains

. And likes the Mississippi Valley. He feels that
this section of the Mississippi is more typical American
than either the East or the West.

In so far as music is concerned, he prefers choral
music . . He has no strong inclination towards the
movies although he admits that his two favorites are
George Arliss a.nd the late Will Rogers . . . One of the
biggest thrills that Dr. Oliver has ever experienced came
to him by way of radio . . He heard the announcer
state that the cattle from the Oliver farm in Missouri
were selling ﬁve cents above top per head.

Mellon Institute Concludes
25 Years Of Research Work

Rounding out its 25th year of research activity, the
Mellon Institute of Industrial Research this week pub-
lished the results of its work since its inception in 1911,
and particularly concerning the accomplishments of the
past year.

Outstanding in this year's work was the progress to-
ward the perfection of anti-pneumonia serum. This

 

. work, -under the department of pure research in chemis-

try, has led to the discovery of an organic material,
“ethylapocupreine,” which has been shown to have posi-
tive killing. effects upon the pneumonia coccus.

The only difficulty with this drug, according to the re-
port, is that it has a bad effect on the eyes. When
tested upon dogs, this extra.ct of quinine bark was said
to have.“deﬁnite visual effects.” Experiments lvith a
kindred compound, just as long-windedly named, “Hydro-
xyethylapocupreine,” have shown it to possess toxic ef-
fects upon the pneumonia germ without affecting the
eyes. The use of this latter drug upon clinical patients
resulted in a high percentage of recoveries from all
types of Pneumonococcic infections without any visual
harm.

A study in the technology and mechanics of shaving
was another work almost completed during 1935-36.
Investigation was made of the relative values of various
types of steel alloys to be used in blades, and‘ a new
alloy has been brought to the commercial stage. Sub-
sidiary reports have shown how best to sharpen the
blade, information which will be of value to manufac-
turers.

As an aid to this research, a shaving clinic was held
to determine just how the face should be prepared for
shaving and how the blade should be used. According
to report “there has come from these studies a sound
explanation of the effects of razor design upon the shape
of the hair shaft stump and upon the character of skin
eruptions caused by shaving.” This has enabled the
manufacture of a new razor with improved shaving
quality.

Other advances of the year have been in the ﬁelds of
steel production, the invention of a new type of safety
glass, the production of an improved jet black marble
and a translucent marble. This translucent marble, it
is said, has luminous qualities which will permit novel
architectural effects. In additon, fl; new specialty paper
made of sugar has been developed and patented, and
work has been done toward determining the value of
liquid butane as a solvent for vitamins, cacao fat, oil
from orange peel, and fat from wool.

The Mellon Institute was founded in 1911 by Andrew
VV. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon. It is managed under
the industrial fellowship system, whereby individuals
and companies may establish fellowships for speciﬁc re-
search projects. Over $600,000 was donated during the
past year for fellowships ,and the total for the past 25
years reaches $10,662,091. Since 1911, 1,085 fellowships
have been granted for study in 268 ﬁelds of technology.

ring the bell for some 20 minutes.

Finally we call the chairman of the
convention and he comes up in a blue
pajama suit to exclaim, “They can't
do this, there’s a law against it!" So
we ring the bell 20 more minutes, and
we wonder what kind of country this
is, with no law enforcement. Then
giving up, we all follow the chairman
to his fraternity, where we sleep.

At the ﬁrst convention meeting, the
president of the college gives us wel-
come and the keys to the city. wen,
after the president has given his ad-
dress he doesn’t sit down; he high-
balls for the exit. Ellis Tumpson,
president of the INA, in thanking the
college prexy for his ﬁne speech, sa-ys.
“We thank the fast-disappearing Mr.
Houlehen for his.we1‘come." Ellis, too.
was feeling pretty chippery that day.

After the ﬁrst convention meeting.
we adjourn to ﬁnd ourselves a- date
at the date bureau (coincidence)- for
the play that evening. It is. the only
thing w.e~are- ever “on time-" for, so we
all: get good dates. One of‘ us pulls
number 13, a. girl named‘ Virginia Pep-
per. ._.The- funny part came in when
we find her nickname is Ginger, Gin-
ger Pepper.

As we said», none of us could ﬁnd
fault with our dates. They were all
swell—a.-nd one nice thing, was that
they had more patience than a free

doctor. out of our four dates (welre
not‘ bragging-,_ either) we were late
‘four times. I

The-. ﬁrst. enter.ta.~inment we took
them. to. was.-. a college version of
-I'«bsen»'-s "Peer Gynt."

After the play, we took off to W_il- j

miﬂgton to the Cafe Grande—one of
the better night clubs——where if you
don't tip the waiter at least four bits,
you're not living up to the NRA,

On Saturday there were two more
long sessions at the convention. One
odd thing was that the Pitt boys
seemed to stand up more than they
sat down, They kept bobbing up and
down from the speakers’ ﬂoor like a
running rooster’s comb. In seven min-
utes ﬁve resolutions were passed,
three for thanks, one in regret, and
one to approve.

The only resolution to be defeated
was one offered by a Pitt delegate.
After it was defeated, the delegate
moved from place to place during the
meeting. changing other delegate-’s
minds. He was pardoned upon his ad-
mission of the fact to the chair.

At 6:: 30 Saturday night we‘ sat down‘
to a formal dinner, and at 9 we em-
barked for a formal dance- at Kent
Hall. Both were very nice but une-
ventful. That is, all except the re-
ceiving line at the dance. It" seems
the custom to line up; all the deans
in; the schools and have them shake
the hands of" everyone attending.
There were more handshakes. there
than at a. Democratic nominating: con.-
vention and so many “good-nights"
that we. began to wonder if it really-
was a good" night,

This brings us up to. Sunday morn-
ing-, the morning we were to have
dates at 7 o'clock with the girls. Well,

branded Hearstian journalistic tactics
as “un-American and potentially

Advocating an inquiry into the “ac-

McKay Estimates
Flood Damage

Reports concerning the damage
done to Pennsylvania public schools
in the recent ﬂood disaster set the
damage at over $800,000, announced
Dr. Marion K, McKay, professor of ec-
onomics and a member of the special
committee appointed by Governor
George H. Earle to investigate the ex-
tent of the damage.

“Appropriations are needed badly,”
stated Dr. McKay, “and will probably
become an important issue at the
special session of the Pennsylvania
State Legislature now in session in
Harrisburg.”

Further reports reveal that a ma-
jority of the estimated damage was in
the two counties of Cambria and Alle-

Pitt Jayvees Open Season
With Slippery Rock Today

Records Show Teams Split Even In Previous Competition;
Varsity Meets Penn State At Stadium Saturday

Pitt’s Jayvee trackmen have drawn a tough assignment in their
first start of the outdoor season when they stack up against the for-
midable Slippery Rock State Teachers’ squad at 3:30 o’clock today

on the Stadium track.

In the past two years, the two teams have split even in the dual

«competition.

Mike Sowiski and Ed Spitz weree

Thigh-point scorers for the Jayvees last
year with ten points apiece. How-
ever, it is unlikely that either of these
boys will compete, since both hold
down positions on the varsity.

The meet will get under way at
3:30 .o’clock. Jack Pfaif is student
coach of the squad that faces Slippery
Rock today.

On Saturday, Coach Olson’s varsity
will attempt to hit the winning trail,
after losing to Notre Dame, when
Penn State’s Nittany Lions invade the
Stadium for the third dual meet of
the outdoor season. In the ﬁrst meet
of the season, Pitt’s thin clads trav-
eled" to Philadelphia and returned
with a victory over the Temple Owls.

Penn State Out For Revenge

Penn State is reputed to have only
a fair squad of runners and jumpers,
with’ the exception of the hundred
and mile events. Last year, Pitt
romped to a 101-33 victory, with Arvel
Fleming scoring 18 points.

Art Thomas, sprint ace, who was
handicapped in the Notre Dame meet
with an ankle injury, may not com-
pete.

Notre Dame Trackers

Defeat Panthers

Led by Pete Bennett, who broke a
12-year-old University high jump rec-
ord, and ably seconded by Taano and
Fassinger, the Panther trackmen man-
aged to break three records before
succumbing to the superior resources
of the Notre Dame boys.

Final score of the meet, which was
held at the Stadium last Saturday aft-
ernoon, was 79 1-6 to 46 5-6. Al-
though the Ramblers proved their su-
periority in nine out of the 14 events,
they were able to produce an excep-
tional performance in only _-one in-
stance, the pole vault, in which‘Gibbs
tied" the meet record of'12' feet, 6
inches. Incidentally, the record was
made by another Notre Dame track-
man, Rohrbach, who established that
mark in 1932. In. 1934, another South

Bender, Edwards, tied Rohrbach's'

record. _
Bennett. Breaks Record-

After tying the meet record, Gibbs
made three attempts to smash it, but
he failed each time. A bit of excite-
ment was furnished‘, on his second. try
when his alumnium pole buckled» un-
derneath him, and. he narrowly missed
serious injury.

The high spot of the afternoon, of
course, was the sensational record-
breaking performance of Pete Ben-
nett. Clearing the bar at 6‘feet, 44;;
inches, he topped the previous Uni-
versity mark set bv W. Robusch back
in 1924. The old i==.cord was 6 feet,
2-75 inches.

In the javelin event, Gene Taano,
the little fellow with a man's-sized
.',1.I‘lll, broke the meet record with a.
throw of 202 feet, 11 inches, in spite
of the strong cross winds that blew
over the Stadium. A former McKees
Rocks high“ school boy-, Sowiski. of
Pi-tt took second place, and Lev-icki,
Notre Dame trackman, came in third."

Panthers Handicapped

Because of the loss of Andy Lasky
and Art Thomas, Panther track. aces,
Notre Dame had the drop on the
Olsonmen before the meet even start-
ed, taking six ﬁrsts in eight races.
Lasky, who was conceded an almost
certain ﬁrst in the high and low hur-
dles, pulled a muscle in the Central
Intercollegiate meet which was held
at South Bend recently. Thomas,
also picked as a probabe winner in
the 100, 220, and 440, sustained an in-
jury in the Penn Relays, which elim-
inated him from competition in Satur-
day's events.

The third Pitt record-breaker, Fas-
singer, broke his own record in the
discus throw, tossing the discus 137
feet, 91/2 inches, some four feet above
the 1934 record.

ing. grid classic once again between
the varsity and “old timers.”
Saturday's game is one of the most
ambitious ventures of the athletic de-

that the affair has been opened to the

public. Previously, only students and
guests during the spring festival week
were admitted.

track meet. The football kick-off‘ will
take place at 3:30 o'clock.

Plenty of lHeft

Coach Kern has rounded up no less
than 32 former “greats” for the
spring training ﬁnale. According
to the “weigh-in” reports as compiled
by Frank Carver, director of Stadium
publicity, the alumni squad‘ will have
plenty of" heft to toss at the 1936 var-
sity squad‘.

Stan Olejniczak and Tiger Wa:lton‘

pared‘ to Howdy O:’Del1’s 155 pounds.
Next in line-, according to beef, comes
Dr. Bobby Hogan, (remember his
boots, Notre Dame?), who tips the
scales at 230 pounds.

Muggsy Skladany, All-American
end, has added almost 30 pounds
since the days when No. 23 smeared
play after play of Pitt foes during the
1933 season- Tar Onder, former star
guard, hits Skladany’s 225-pound‘
mark, followed by Dick Matesic and
Bob Hoel at 215 pounds.

Other boys who hit the 200-pound
division are Nick Kliskey, Art Detzel,
Miller Munjas, “Pinny” Heller, Jess
Quatse, Bob Timmins, Paul Cuba,
John Love, Bob Ciper, Vin Sites, and
Len Rector.

In the ﬁfth and ﬁnal inter-squad

three individual matches, but the
Pitt boys took the three best-ball
events to ﬁnish out in front.

In the feature battle of the match
Pat Symonds, Panther No. 1 man,
dropped the opener of the day, going
18 holes before losing to the Geneva
captain, Tommy Weisltopf, one up.
Weiskopf had a medal score of 72,
while Symonds pulled a 73.

Johnny Wasco, playing the No. 2
position in Souchak’s absence, defeat-
ed Jones of Geneva, 3 and 2. The
other two Panther points in individual
matches came when Bob Baughman
defeated Stockton, 4 and 3, and Sam
Musico‘ whipped. Hlista, 7- and 6.

Dropping their matches to the Ge-
nevans were Pat Symonds, Bill Fol-
lette, who lost to Frazer of Geneva,
one‘. up, and Bob Mease, who was de-
feated by Fulton, one up.

 . Lose At Washington

While the linksmen’s showing 011
Friday and Saturday at Washington
doesn’t look so good on the record
books, their prestige didn’t suffer a
bit.

Losing 8-1 decisions to Princeton
and Georgetown on Saturday, the
Pitt boys now ﬁnd themselves in the
cellar position of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Golf Conference. How-
ever, the playing of Pat Symonds and
Frank Souchak in the trio of matches
stamped these gentlemen as two of
the ﬁnest collegiate golfers in the
country.

Playing at No. 1 post in the Prince-
ton match Souchak took Princeton’s
best, Billy Marks, 1 up on the 20th
green, and Symonds at the next posi-
tion carried his opponent, Malloy, to
the 18th hole before losing a 1 up
match. Malloy was runner-up in the
National Intercollegiate tournament
last summer. Souchak made a com-
plete sweep of his three singles’ en-
gagements, taking over his Hoya op-
ponent in‘ the afternoon. '

Tomorrow the team leaves for
Ithaca-, New York, where it will meet
two more conference foes in the semi-
ﬁnal round of the league’s schedule.
Cornell will form the opposition on
Friday and Penn State on Saturday.

Varsity Courtmen
Oppose Bethany

Meet This Afternoon At Stadium;
Tangle with W&J Tomorrow

, Panther netters will seek their third
straight court victory when they tan-
gle with the Bethany College "tennis
outﬁt this afternoon on the Stadium
rectangles. Tomorrow afternoon the
varsity meets the raqueteers from
W. & J. at the Stadium courts.

With hopes of surpassing last sea.-
son’s- record‘, when the team lost only
one match, Coach Dave O’Loughlin
will send his strongest lineup" against
the West Virginia collegians‘.

Bob Madden, university champion,
will be at his accustomed place in the
No, 1 job, and his perennial titular
nemesis, Ralph Bald, will take care of
the No. 2 post.

In No. 3 position will be Captain
Joe Madden, and probably Roy Heck-
ler will be found at the next post.
Irv Solow and John Mogan complete
the varsity sextet.

Experimenting with the doubles
pairings. in.. the Duke affair Coach
O’Loughlin found" a couple of likely-
looking twosomes in Bill McKenna
and Jim Thompson and Ed Helm and
Tom Locke. Both these teams came
through in ﬁne fashion against the
Hilltoppers, so it is likely that they
will see action today and tomorrow.

Thus far the Panthers have swamp-
ed all opposition, taking Grove City
by an 8-1 margin and administering a
9-0 shellacking to Duquesne. _ _

The good weather last week was a
boom to the tennis players, allowing
them for the ﬁrst time this year to
get some outdoor practice. Previously
the boys had to depend on the courts
in Duquesne Garden.

With the large number of promis-
ing varsity material available, Coach
O’Loughlin can afford to concentrate
on team strength in both branches of
match play. Heretofore he has relied
on his singles’ nominees to carry on
in the doubles play.

Mushball Teams

Independent League Nines Meet
In Intramural Openers

 

Competition in the Intramural
mushball leagues gets underway this
afternoon when. entries in the Inde-
pendent circuit battle on the Trees

Kappa Alpha Phis, champions in
their league last year, start the. de-

week.
the various houses. .

Memories of" last year's heated in-
terfraternity league
heard, so that another. good season
seems to be in the offing, Kappa- Sig-
ma won the cup and Phi Delta Theta-
got the runner-up award’, only after
a play-off with the Delts.

The mushball tournament was
scheduled to‘ have begun a- couple of?
weeks ago, but unfavorable weather
and the Spring Festival caused a post-

ponement.
Winners and runner-ups in each
league will meet in an elimination

tourney. Gold Panther medals will
be awarded to the champions with
silver and bronze medallions going
to the next two outﬁts.

Martin J. Feely, director of Intra-
mural athletics, hopes to have the
mushball leagues completed‘ in rec-
ord time because of the late start.
For this end, he has obtained the use
of three ﬁelds and ﬁve diamonds.
Three games can be played at one
time on Schenley Oval, and. the two
ﬁelds up at Trees Gymnasium will
be used.

“It is necessary for all teams to
show up at the scheduled time for
games or else forfeits will be dished
out,” adds Mr. Feely.

With the completion of softball, In-
tramural activities will come to a
close, and participants can get their
batting eyes trained on ﬁnal exams,
which sport is open to all students
who wish to take them.

‘Business Review’
Records Recovery

New Level Reached By Industries
In City Post-Flood Period

In the Bureau of Business Research
“Pittsburgh Business Review” for the
month of April 1936, business in the
Pittsburgh district is shown to have
recovered at an almost unbelieveable
rate since the ﬂood waters receded in
March.

Less than one week after the ﬂood
had started to recede business and in-
dustry were again in operation and
within the short period of four weeks
business activity in the Pittsburgh
district had reached its highest level
in the recovery period. The index for
this four-week period recorded a jump
of _more than 38 points, an increase
which the Bureau believes cannot con-
tinue.

Industrial production played a prom-
inent part in the sharp increase in
the index of business activity with the
iron and steel industry especially
helpful.

The Bureau points out in this re-
spect however, that the iron and steel
industry was damaged less than most
of the major lines of industry in the
district. Many of the plants were
shut down only a few days following
the ﬂood and working schedules were
increased substantially during the
ﬁrst half of April.

In the third week of the month, the
industry was operating at about 65
per cent of capacity, the highest rate
reported since the summer of 1930.
The Bureau states, moreover, that the
operating rate in the industry is near-
er the national average than it has
been in three years.

A further encouraging sign in the
industry is the increasing demand
coming from the capital goods indus-
tries, the branch of the industry that
has lagged behind in the recovery pe-
I'IIOd. I

A pronounced gain in polished glass
production for the ﬁrst three months
of this year as compared with the
same period of time last year was al-
so announced by the Bureau, as were

gains in the building industry and

industrial power.
Retail business in the district re-
ﬂected a drop of more than 12 per
cent in total retail sales between Feb-
ruary and March of this year. De-
spite this drop, aggregate retail sales
in the district were 2.2 per cent above
those in the ﬁrst quarter of 1935.
Though little freight moved on the
rivers in'the last half of March, total
tonnage in the month was considera-
lily larger than that in February.
River shipments of coal and coke were
especially heavy. In contrast, com-
bined rail -shipments in . arch took a
decided drop, ~ - . -- -

lStudents Confess
Extent Of Honesty
In Questioimaires

Is there cribbing. transfer of infor-
mation, and the like on examinations
in most of the classes which you now
attend?

Are such practices prevalent in this
particular course?

Have you any suggestions for im-
provement of the situation?

These, and similar questions are be-
ing answered anonymously by stu-
dents in eight departments who are
ﬁlling out the special honesty ques-
tionnaires prepared by the Committee
on the Improvement of Teaching. Co-
chairinen of the committee are Dr. 0.
 Blackwood, professor of physics.
and Dr. James S. Taylor, professor of
mathematics.

Circulated among classes in the
chemistry, physics, botany, zoology,
sociology, psychology, history, and
philosophy departments, the question-
naire includes the following explana-
tion:

“Certain instructors and students
believe that there is a considerable
amount of dishonesty in examinations
at the University, while others hold
that there is very little. All agree
that it is desirable to learn the facts
and to this end we ask you to supply
the following information.”

There follows space for checking
what particular types of cheating, if
any, the student has personally ob-
served in his classes.

Dr. B.1ackwood is not yet certain to
what" use information obtained by the
questionnaires will be put, but expects
to have deﬁnite data on the results
by the end of week.

 Digestion proceeds more smoothly. . .alkalinity is increased. ..when
you make Camels a pleasant interlude in dining

There is a delightful sense of com-
fort and good feeling that comes
after a good meal— and Camels.
Modern life hammers at your nerves
and digestion. ,Gen_tly, naturally,
Camels restore and increase the ﬂow
of digestive ﬂuids . . . alkaline diges-
tive ﬂuids...so vital to the enjoy-

ment of food...so necessary for

good digestion. And Camels never

jangle the nerves!

Smoking Camels is one of life’s
unfailing pleasures. So enjoy Camels
at wi1l—with meals—between "meals
—for a refreshing “lift”—for pure
contentment. Camels set you right!

AT THE COPLEY-PLAZA. Two of Boston’s recent
délmtantes and their escorts were snapped by a society
photographer in the gracious Louis XIV Dining Room
as they chose a tempting entre’e—then paused for their
Camels to set the proper key of enjoyment. As Louis,
maitre d’Ia6tel, says: “It goes without saying that Camels
are favored at the Copley-Plaza.”
