I Gardner Terms N

ews’ Criticism

Of Food Service a *iWitchhunt’

‘Student Congress late Monday
afternoon heard its vice president,
Robert Gardner, attack criticism
of the University Food Service
earlier this year as “a witchhunt
on the part of the Pitt News” in
his committee report to the school
governing body on the food situ-
ation. -

Gardner spoke as an individual
and not for Congress. He chaired
a committee investigating charges
that prices in the Tuck Shops and
cafeteria were way out of line
with those of other Oakland eat-
cries.

No Conclusion

The Congress VP said he had

come “to no signiﬁcant conclusion”

as to the quality, quantity, and
. gh ,, . ,

present committee," he said,
“have lost enthusiasm for the proj-
ect.”

The lack of information com-
piled to date prompted Congress
to invite the head of the Food
Service, Miss Ruth Cramblett, to
“answer any questions on the sub-
ject” at its next meeting Monday.

Get Discrimination Report

Congress also decided to spon-
sor a Brotherhood Week and heard
a report on the progress of Con-
gress’ Discrimination Committee.
The solons were promised atop
notch program of assembly speak-
ers and movies by Assemblies
Chairman Don Milletary. Sam

Shapiro called for more pep on the I

andthe

The Brotherhood Week proposal
was labeled “a waste of time" by
WSGA president Nancy Tear, who
explained that she thought it
would do no good.

After a short discussion the
Brotherhood m e a s u r e passed

easily. Bob Gardner commented
that Congress could not “under-
estimate the value of such a pro-
gram.”

The ﬁve months of suspense has ended. At 2 p.m. Monday
the Athletic Department announced that Lowell ‘Red’, Daw-
son would be the next Pitt football coach succeeding Tom‘

Hamilton.

Dawson accepted the position by phone on Monday, and.‘
will be signed to a three year contract when he arrives in’

Pittsburgh. I
Right now, he
composed of three girls, aged

sibility that he will arrive in Pittsburgh later
r .__... - -   ... ....

Salary Over $10,000

The terms of the contract have
not been disclosed; however Daw-
son’s salary will probably be one
of the highest paid at Pitt. Len
Casanbva’s $12,500 salary is the
highest as of now.

Dawson, reported to be the

highest paid assistant coach in
the country at $10,000 per year,
was Hamilton’s choice for the
post. After the Athletic Com-
mittee and Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald had approved
Hamilton’s selection, the Execu-
tive Board of the Board of
Trustees conﬁrmed‘ Dawson as
the new head coach. '

In a telephone conversation
with The Pitt News Dawson stat-
ed that he had no idea on assist-
ant coaches, but that “it is ab-
solutely not true that I will bring
Michigan State assistants with
me.” —

Coached Professionals

Hamilton says, “He has free
choice of who his assistants will
be. But we recommended our as-
sistants to him highly.”

In addition to Pitt, Dawson
was approached by Iowa, Indi-
ana, the Chicago Cardinals, and
the Washington Redskins for
their head coaching jobs. But
he considered Pitt as a challenge
and expressed his feeling to-
ward Pitt last fall when he said

tion.” « A ” r
Hamilton, in the official notice
of his termination as interim
coach, expressed regrets in not
coaching the Pitts next year. “II

She hopes/ to continue her

An interest in the culture and
history of Yugoslavia has always
been a hobby with her, Miss
Mravintz admitted. Her parents
were both born in’ that country,
then known as Austria-Hungary.

Her father first came to the
United States in 1889 at the age of
15. He later returned to Yugo-
slavia where he met and married
her mother. Neither parent, how-
ever, has returned there since 1907.

“So I’m very happy to have the
opportunity to visit there.”

Her position with the State De-
partment has no time limit on it.
“I do know that I get a month’s
vacation at the end of two years,”
she added:

Anxious To Start

“I’m anxious to get started. Al-.
though I’ve had a cultural tie with
the country through my parents

and what they have taught me,‘

there has really been no actual
contact.” '

“And,” she concluded, “on top
of all my other preparations for
the trip, I have to sell my car.
Do you know anyone who’d like
to buy a 1946eOldsmobile? I’m
selling it for $650.”

Oath Held Not Immediate Danger a

Professor Charles W. Taintor, of
the School of Law, last week‘told
a gathering of the local chapter of
the American Association of Uni-
versity Professors that the Loy-
alty Oath law “is much less a
practical danger than (it was) in
its initial form.”-

He pointed out that the act is
not “a source of immediate prac-
tical danger” and declared that the
University would not ﬁre anyone
“unless it is clearly proven that
he is a. subversive.”

Must Submit Reports

As the law stands Prof. Taintor
stressed that the immediate effect
on the faculty would be indirect.
It would come about because the
University might not satisfy the
governor with its report as called
for in Section 13 of the code.

Prof. 'Taintor explained that
Section 13'requires state-aided in-
stitutions to submit annualreports
on “what procedures the Univer-
sity has adopted to determine
whether it has. reason to believe
that subversive persons are in its
anploy; what steps, if any, have
been taken to terminate such em-
ployment; and it must speciﬁcally
out forth that the University has
no reason to believe that any. sub-
Versives are in its-«em‘ploy.” ' '

the natural way some people ac-
quire immunity early in life with-
out developing the disease.

In commenting on the project,
Dr. Salk explained: “The results
of animal experiments in this
and other laboratories indicate
the way in which this can be ac-.
complished. It is merely a mat-
ter of time before the most satis-
factory proceedure will be select-
ed as a result of laboratory inves-
tigations now in progress.”

. Vaccine Promising

The most promising possibility
is a vaccine containing three dif-
ferent types of polio virus. The
virus is treated to kill its disease-
producing qualities while leav-
ing an immunizing effect.

.The typing of the three polio
viruses has « been described ‘ by
the foundation as “an,essential
ﬁrst step toward the ~attempt to
produce a preventative vaccine.”

The three viruses have been nam-
ed Brunhilde: Lansing, and Leon.

which might lead to difficulties.
“1.) What can properly impel
the governor to -refuse to ap-
proye a report?

2.) How can the University re-
port at the same time what steps
are being taken to terminate the
employment of a subversive per-
son and that the University has no
reason to believe that any sub-
versive persons are in its employ?

_3.) -What sort of procedure

can and should the University
adopt to ﬁnd out whether it has
reason to. believe that any sub-
versive persons are in its im-
ploy? ‘

4.) Who are subversive persons?

5.) How about our foreign
teachers?” ,_

In "setting up a procedure for
examining. accused subversives,
Prof. Taintor held that “it is al-
most impossible to set up a pro-
cedure which gives too much pro-
tection to the individual.” He rec-
ommended that a committee
established to handle complaints
and to give accused persons ample
opportunity to defend themselves.

Dr. Martin said that Eisenhow-

bility for the nomination would
mark “the beginning of increas-

“The fundamental cleavage be-

Prof. Taintor stressed the im-

damage which. could be wrought
upon a man’s life by irresponsible
charges. He recommended that the
“accused person should be per-
mitted to represent himself, to be
represented by legal counsel, or
by any person he might wish.”

He warned that the law, while
not immediately dangerous, may
“lead us, and the public in gen-
eral, to acquiesce in another step
in the direction of bureaucratic
control of action and of thought.”

“The fact that we shall not be
hurt by this particular act should-
not make us forget that l'pberty’s
price is vigilance,” he declared.

Taft Organization Strong

As of now, Martin believes Taft
possesses the greater organization
strength in the GOP pre-conven-
tion skirmishing, , but Ike has
greater popular appeal.-

“A deadlocked convention,”
commented Martin, “might. well
result in a dark horse walking off

California is a possibility, but the
‘fourth GOP aspirant, Harold Stas-
sen, seems out of the running.”

Martin agreed that much crit-
icism of the General will center
.around his famous statement four
years ago in which Ike said pro-
fessional soldiers should abstain
from seeking political otﬁce.

Dimes Return
We should like to have been the ﬁrst to bring you the
gnews, that the March of Dimes fund~~had awarded Pitt
311,421 for infantile paralysis research. Like most students,
.-we take a great deal of pride in our University and when
‘Pippa tribute such as this is passed our way, we feel that our
pride is justiﬁed. ‘ .
1 ‘ The fact that the Dimes fund selected the University
or‘ such a large scale research job is an indication of our
T:.i,’c.reasing importance in the ﬁeld of medicine. If the day
-comes when this dreaded disease is conquered by man,

«If they place any faith at all in the Horatio Alger legend,

Bro tlrerliaml Okay

 There are some people on campus. who don’t think
oojmuch of the Student Congress brotherhood committee.

ey regard it as ]1.lSt another means of stirring up trouble
or as nothing more than a waste of time. We disagree. ..
, It is in the very nature of an investigation to stir up
trouble. The necessity of hearing testimony by an unselect-
ed “group of students will inevitably result in many loose
cusations and unsubstantiated rumors.
, _ s This committee will take these accusations and rumors.
and-show them for what they are worth. It will eventually
clear up many so-called facts which have long been in the
province of gossip. .

g That it is a_ waste of time is truein the historical sense
only. Everything from the standpoint of eternity is a
Waste of time. We would all probably. be much wiser if
‘Wefdevoted our energies to our own immediate affairs and
ignored the world. *

w_ A 5-Since we are generally unimpressed with eternity or
incapable of grasping its signiﬁcance, we might as well
turn our attention to the problems of today. We should
throw our whole—hearted support behind this worthy com-
mittee, which is in reality investigating the workings of
democracy in a so-called citadel of democracy. ‘

'Mutes' Not Tolking

In the first article in this series, the question

“Is birth control moral” was used as an example ‘

of an issue in which one side was endorsed by
casual acceptance in classes here., . i
The important fact which we tried to bring
out was that few students bother to challenge
a. teacher when they disagree on this or any
question. '

The apathy, this undemand-
ing attitude which brings us to
some classes to listen rather than
to learn, is carried to amazing
lengths.

One philosophy teacher (still
at Pitt) whose own philosophy
is best described as futility,
made a habit last spring of tell-
ing obscene jokes to a mixed
class. . _

Some students enjoyed this kind of “lecture,”
some didn’t but stayed mute, and some justhabit
ually cut his classes. *

The main complaint is against the mutes in
this class and every class who disagree but don’t
open their mouths. ‘ “

Concerning the‘ birth control example, for in-
stance, there are certainly strong opinions that
could be cited by anyone believing that it is fun-
damentally a -moral question.

The most recent systematiclist of moral objec-
tions to modern attempts to prevent the natural
consequences of the marriage act was an address
by Pope Pius XII last ‘October. A

The complete text of the address in a pamphlet,
titled “Moral Questions Affecting Married Life”
is available‘ from the National Catholic iWelfare
Conference,’ 1312 Massachusetts Ave., Wash. (5)
D. C., but the gist of it can be given quickly here:

Repeating the Roman Catholic ,Church’s age-
old teachings. he deﬁned the primary purpose of
marriage as‘ “the procreation‘ and education of
children.”.

' Important, but second to this, was placed the
personal satisfaction of the ‘marfied couple.

Outlining clearly the Catholic stand, the Pope
acknowledged that serious reasons—-medical, eu-

Coeds. ROTC  Wor of State

Penn State Collegian‘ '

Oﬂicials of Penn State’s Army ROTC were
blasted by a ‘group of jumpy coeds last week,_ who
were upset by riﬂe shots from the ﬁringxrange set
up in their dormatory basement.

' In a letter t.o the Daily Collegian, “The Girls
of the Ground Floor” of Atherton Hall complained
of the noise. Firing’ began_ in the Atherton base-
ment on Monday,.Jan. 7, when '
the range was opened for use
after a semester-long construc-
tion period. A’,

According to the Collegian,
the range was transferred from
the Armory when an increase in
the Air ROTC staff put space at
military headquarters at a pre-
mium. A

The decision to place the :;
range in the girls’ dorm, according to a State ad-
ministration spokesman, was the ,“only practical
solution” to the space problem. Realizing that the
site is not a completely satisfactory one, the
Collegian continues, College officials may rescue
the riﬂe-shy’ dorm residents by discontinuing use
of the range. A

Considering the rate at which the Atherton
range was built, the Penn State ROTC is going to

moral, including those made possible by modern
developments in biology.

Deliberate abortion was condemned because:

Temporary or permanent direct sterilization by

men or public authority, “depriving the organism’ W

was called a “grave violation of the moral law.” S

Against artiﬁcial insemination the objection was
thatthe factor of personal cooperation of husband.

Injury Hits Matmen
In Crucial Match

-1537 ._DON SCHURMAN
Lady Lucky executed a sudden reversal at the Field
House last Saturday, and Rex Peery’s wrestlers fell from
the undefeated elite, 16-14, to Michigan State.

With the meet apparently cinch- 6

ed for Pitt and only two minutes
remaining to the ﬁnal match,
heavyweight Joe Kane in an-odd
twist dislocated his elbow to lose
by default and give the Spartans
ﬁve decisive points.

In exactly the same way, Pitt
had defeated Michigan the week
before when a Michigan grappler
defaulted with an elbow disloca-
tion.

Face State Next

The peculiar loss brings Pitt’s
record to 3-1 as Peery prepares his
men for what promises to be their
stiffest assignment of the season
at Penn State this Saturday.

“Charlie Spiedel has one of the
best teams in the country at State
this year,” Peery reports.

Besides, Pitt will be minus the
services of Kane (1-3); “Joe will
be out for probably the whole sea-
son,” says Peery. “E1dred Krae-
mer and Don Anthony will com-
pete for the heavyweight post if
they're in condition yet.”

Gridders Take Up Mat Work

Both Kraemer and Anthony
were linemen on the football team,
and, because of their football
chores, were late in reporting for

, wrestling. V.

main intact. Hugh Peery and

Rivalry

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

Dr. H. C. Carlson’s cagers a

ren’t expecting Carnegie Tech

to roll over dead tonight but they do prophesize a more
enjoyable evening than the one West Virginia gave them

last Saturday.

The Panthers visit the Plaid tonight at 8330 at Skibo
gym following the preliminary game between the frosh-JV
squads of both schools at 7 p.m.

After a hectic week with twee
nationally rated teams-Syracuse
and West Virginia—-the Panthers
face the other extreme—Tech—
rated at the bottom of the district’s
Tri-state big ten. '

Pitt Favored

Pitt is favored to claim its sixth
victory in ten starts against the
Tech passers (4-6).

Penn State is the only common

foe that Pitt and Tech have met
so far this season. State easily
beat both of them, but Tech has
some consolation in losing to the
Nittanies by 18 points. Pitt was
humbled in the Steel Bowl ﬁnale,
62-40.

Tech coach Mel Cratsley ﬂoors
four experienced lettermen from
last year and one freshman, Fran-
cis K,uenzig of Homestead high
school.

Craig High Scorer

Last year the Tartans surprised
Pitt at Skibo, routing them, 66-42.
Of course, the humiliation was

avenged at the Stadium when Pitt
applied the polish, 70-45.

This year, Tom Craig, 6-1 junior
forward, is the top Tech scorer
with 131 points. Craig has dumped
49 ﬁeld giials and 33 fouls.

Against State Saturday Craig

totaled 15 points to lead the Tar- ’
tan attack. Hilary I-Iolste con-- ,

tributed 14.

Workman Scores Only 11

Dr. Carlson hopes his hoopsters
can bounce back-from their 79'-60
defeat to West Virginia and begin
another winning streak. On two
different occasions the Panthers
have scored successive victories,
only to forget their winning ways
in their third outing. .

After the West Virginia defeat
Carlson remarked that “the Moun-
taineers looked like the best team
we’ve -faced all year." As ' for
Mark Workman, well, Pitt’s,newly
installed zone defense kept the 6-9
marksman under temporary con-

trol (he scored 11 points) but his .

performance as a ﬂoor man was
invaluable to the Mounties.
Harry Moore destroyed all Pitt
hopes for an upset ‘ViCt0I'y,$di8¢
playing a terriﬁc tﬁrst-half shoot-
ing performance. Moore netted 22
points-—the game’s high point man.

Chorba was out of the Chem E
lineup.

The sloppily played game had
few thrills. The fracas never got
rough and no player left the
game on fouls.

It was a hard, clean basketball
game —— not very exciting —- but
played by sportsmen.

“Heinie,” 85 -Year Old Camp
Night Watchman, Retires 5

By DAVE VVINTER

Henry Mellon, a Pitt ﬁxture for more than a score of
years, severed his connection with the University last Thurs-

day

‘Despite the connotations of his famous name, Mr. Mel-

lon, or “Heinie” as most of his friends called him, was not a
very distinguished guy. He was not related to the family
which made his name famous, had no degrees after his name,
and he isn’t even listed in the University directory.

feel the warm sun on his face,
Heinie was Pitt’s night watchman
--an old fellow with a mustache
and a limp, so old that he seem-
ed not just small but almost
shrunken. '

‘Heinie was known best, but
mostly by sight, to the after-dark
segment of Pitt’s population. Few
knew his real name. They re-
membered him, if at all, because
of a oelligerence natural to his
job and because when he rode
the elevators, he rode them alone,
turning his key in the clocks

which recorded his nightly pro-
gress from basement to top ﬂoor.

He seldom voiced more than a
grunt, but when a point-blank
question forced him to string gut-
tural words together, the effect
was a startling series of deep bass
sounds vibrating like a voice from
a cave. ,
 85 Years Old

Heinie was 85 on his last birth-
day. Last summer when the Uni-
versity honored some of the faith-
ful, he got a pin for 20 years
service and had his picture in
