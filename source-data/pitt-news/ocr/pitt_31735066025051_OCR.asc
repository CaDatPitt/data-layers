It looks like WPTS, the campus-
run radio station, will no longer
be “98.5, your progressive FM” if
the Federal Communications
Commission has anything to say
about it.

On May 28, the FCC gave WPTS
a 60-day notice to change its
frequency from 98.5 because
WPTS was interfering with the
broadcast patterns of WESA in
Charleroi, a‘ town south of
Pittsburgh.

Two years ago the FCC allowed
certain radio stations to increase
their power where they couldn’t
before. One of those was WESA.

There was apparently no
complaint by WESA, according
to WPTS general manager Ron
Asbury. “They probably aren’t
even aware that we are interfering
with them. lt’s a very tiny overlap,”
Asbury said. “The reason the FCC
gave us the notice is because
they apparently caught it on their
computers and they wanted to
head offany confrontation before
it even began.”

“It’s a problem that had to

WPTS to change frequencies

happen eventually,” said station
manager John McDonald. “We
were put in the commercial band
by luck, I guess. We weren’t
supposed to be in the commercial
band in the first place. We’re not
a commercial radio station. Some-
one was going to boost their
power and shove us around.”

The FCC suggested 92.1 and
103.9 as new frequencies for
WPTS, which has been at 98.5
since 1984. 92.1 is probably the
more likely choice because 103.9
is well into the commercial band,
where several radio stations can
apply for power increases, and
WPTS, as a Class D non-
commercial station, would' be
forced to move again. 91.9 and
below are non-commercial radio
frequencies. , ~

Once the FCC approves the
new frequency, WPT S will ask
for a 30-day extension, or at least
until the fall term begins so that
returning students will know
about the change.

It is hard to tell when the actual
change will take place. “It may
be that they won't even OK the
change until six months from
now,” Asbury said.

WPT S, which broadcasts at 10
watts, will be technically
unaffected by the change. The
antenna will remain on top of the
Cathedral of Learning, and WPTS
will be as powerful as ever.

“It’s an annoyance. We've been
here for years. Everybody’s used
to 98.5,” Asbury said.

“It would have been nice if we
would have been given a bigger
field of choices. I understand the

FM dial is kind of cluttered and

it’s kind of hard to wedge us in
there somewhere, McDonald said.

WPTS will probably incorporate
the 30th anniversary of the

University of Pittsburgh radio this .

fall with a promotion to inform
listeners of the frequency change.
Pitt radio was started in the early
’60s by Adrian Cronauer of Good
Morning, Vietnam fame. The first
station was WPGH-AM.

According to Asbury, the WPTS
call letters will stay the same.
“Hold on to your WPTS 98.5 T-
shirts because they’ll be co1lector’s
items,” he said.

“It would have been nice if we
didn’t have to move from 98.5,
but there seems to be no choice
about it,” McDonald said.

is an expanded version of the original Presby ER.
The capacity was expanded from 19 to 29 rooms.

Plans for the consolidation started late last fall,
according to Vince Verdile, director of the
Emergency Department of UPMC. The physical
construction lasted from March 1 to July 1. “They
worked almost 18 to 20 hours a day to get it done,”
Verdile said. '

The construction was started because the UPMC
bought Montefiore in 1990. “The institution ended
up with duplication of many different services,”
Verdile said. “Operating rooms, cafeterias,
emergency departments, so there’s a variety of
different areas that are duplicated. Some of them
need to be essential parts of each hospital, and
some‘ could be best served by having uniﬁed
services. Emergency services was one of them.”

The emergency departments of both hospitals
needed renovation, Verdile said.

“Instead of rebuilding two emergency
departments, why don’t we continue to rebuild
one, but expand it to accommodate both patients?”
he said.

how it goes.”

Verdile said both hospitals are mirror images of
each other, but now all patients will funnel through
one entrance to get to those hospitals.

“I think it was common sense. We obviously are
saving money, and that is a big issue in health care
today. v

By having two hospitals maintain two fully
staffed emergency departments with doctors and
nurses and technicians and equipment, we’ve
taken that problem and solved it by putting them
all in one shop,” Verdile said

The Montefiore ER was shut down onJune 30 at
11 p.m. The long-range plans for the space are
unknown right now. Almost all the emergency
staff at Montefiore has come to Presby, according
to Verdile.

“Sure, it makes great financial sense  to have
one [ER]. But for me, the main driving factor was
to consolidate all the emergency services on the
campus and to bring the emergency expertise
under one roof and provide a very state—of-the-art,
high-quality facility,” Verdile said.

Baboon liver transpla

By Pete Kapustynski
Staﬂ“ Writer

The 35-year-old patient who received
a baboon’s liver is breathing on his own
and has been upgraded from critical to
serious condition. The liver is functioning
normally, and doctors as yet have found
no evidence of rejection, according to

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

A .

spokesperson Lisa Rossi.

“I think our chances of succeeding are
really quite good," said Dr. Thomas Starzl,
chief of Pitt’s Transplantation Institute, at
a news conference Monday.

According to Dr. Andreas Tzakis, a
member of the transplant team, the patient
has been awake and has sat in a c_hair and
watched television.

The first baboon-liver transplant into a

...,

human took place June 28 at Presbyterian
University Hospital. The operation took
11 hours.

The patient was suffering from chronic,
active hepatitis B, a disease that destroys
the liver and leads to the patient’s death.

Starzl said patients with hepatitis B are
not suitable transplant candidates for
human donor livers because there is a

high risk that the newly implanted human

—‘-«'12-'.A'-~'.y'.-.' .-'».—'-.---.'a.- . .1-‘AL s -_ .. -.1 -«

nt recipient's condition improving

liver will also become infected with
hepatitis B.

According to Starzl, baboons cannot be
infected with hepatitis B.

The next seven to 10 days are the critical
period in seeing how the patient
progresses, according to Starzl.

This is the period when rejection
involving antibodies could occur, he
said.

Chemistry Olympiad comes to Pittsburg

By Pete Kapustyns
Sta_ﬂ' Writer .

Chemists from around the
world will be gathering to do
more than experiment with test
tubes and beakers this weekend
as Pitt hosts the opening
ceremony of the 24th Inter-
national Chemistry Olympiad this
Sunday in the William Pitt
Union.

This is the first year that the
«olympiad will be held in the
United States.

A different participating country
organizes and hosts the event
each year. Last year, the olym-
piad was held in Lodz, Poland.
Next year, it will be held in
Italy.

“In the 23 Years preceding this,
the olympiad has never been
held outside of Europe. For it to
be held in the U.S. and then to be

A right here at Pitt is very
prestigious,” said W. Richard
Howe, director of the olympiad’s
Pittsburgh organizing committee
andassociate dean of academic

affairs in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences at Pitt.

The ceremony starts off a week
of competition among 136 high
school students from around the
world. Flags and standards of the
students’ 34 countries will be
displayed.

Pitt Provost Donald Henderson,
Carnegie Mellon Provost Paul
Christiano and Pittsburgh City
Council President Jack Wagner
will participate in the opening
ceremony.

Pitt and CM are hosting the
competition phase" of the
olympiad July 13 to 17 at the
Chevron Science Center. The
main academic competition of
the olympiad consists of 10 hours
of testing.

“It helped [us to be picked for
the olympiad site by] having two
major universities side by
side.

The adults from the
participating countries that write
and give the tests for the olympiad
have to be housed separately
from the students who are

competing. The adults are being
housed" in CM dormitories, and
the students will be in the Pitt
dormitories,” Howe said.

“I’ve always felt that Pittsburgh
is someplace special and also felt
it is someplace special for the
chemical community of Pitts-
burgh. This shows Pittsburgh is a
special place for chemists," Howe
said.

“Pittsburgh has historically been
a center for chemical education,”
Howe said.

After the academic portion of
the olympiad, the students will
compete in “Cooperative Team
Events.” .

These nine events are
academic-athletic, chemistry-
related sports events, according
to the American Chemical Society
News Service.

“Our [academic] Facilities were
described as outstanding.
However, they also looked at the
available sports facilities,” Howe
said.

The Cooperative Team Events
will be held July 17 at CM’s

Intramural Field. _ .

“This is not just a Pitt event, it
is a citywide event. We received
a lot of support from Pittsburgh
corporations both in cash
contributions and in kind
contributions.

I’m very pleased at all the
different parts of Pittsburgh that
pulled together for this unique
event,” Howe said.

The U.S. delegation consists of
Swaine Chen of O’Fallon
Township High School, O’Fallon,
Ill.;Jeffrey Chuang, Bellaire High
School, Bellaire, Texas;
Christopher Herzog, Highland
Park High School, Highland Park,
N.J., and Logan McCarthy,
Amherst Central High School,
Amherst, N.Y.

The four students in the U.S.
delegation were selected from
an original group of 10,000
students nationwide who took
qualifying exams, according to
the ACS News Service.

. “I’m just ecstatic,” Howe said.
“This is a very prestigious
event.”

Labor, business and the future
of Pennsylvania’s economy were
the topics of discussion at the
Pitt-hosted House Joint Policy
Committee open forum on jobs
yesterday in the William Pitt
Union.

“The focus of our hearing today
is to determine where we are as
a Pennsylvania business climate
today, and also where the
business management forces and
labor forces see us going 10 years
from now or 20 years from now,”
Democratic Co-Chair Rep-
resentative Greg Fajt said.

According to Fajt, the
committee is a bipartisan group
of 11 democrats and 11
republicans. The group will get
together as a caucus to formulate
legislation that will help
businesses plan for the future of
Pennsylvania’s economy.

The committee consulted
assorted experts on management
and labor from around
Pennsylvania to assess the current
and potential future employment
opportunities in Pennsylvania,
according to Fajt.

“We feel it’s incumbent upon
us as legislators and public
officials to get involved in the job
market, because after all that’s
what we’re all about. We have
got to provide a sound fiscal
environment for business and for
labor in Pennsylvania,” Fajt
said.

The House Joint Policy
Committee heard testimony from
a number of researchers on topics
such as agricultural and food
industry employment and high-
technology projects for
Pennsylvania.

Research Associate at Pitt’s
University Center for Social and
Urban Research Ralph Bangs

THE Pl'IT NEWS, Wednesday, July 8. 1992

House panel explores future of Pennsylvania economy

presented his report
“Employment Trends in the
Pittsburgh Region.”

The recession of the cou ntry in
general has affected employment
in the Pittsburgh region, but the
number of manufacturing jobs in
the Pittsburgh region has been
declining for 30 years, according
to Bangs.

“Demand for workers in the
nation and region is likely to
remain soft through the remainder
of 1992. There is no reason to
believe that 1993 will be much
better,” Bangs said.

Bangs made two recom-
mendations to improve job
prospects locally. First increase
support for entrepreneurial
endeavors in the form of both

start-ups and new products,

services or markets by existing
companies.

Second, reduce labor costs,
especially the large and growing

costs of health insurance and

worker compensation.
New jobs must be created

locally to improve long-term '

employment
according to Bangs.

“Do not expect manufacturing
to produce many new jobs even
though productionmay increase.
Do not expect many current firms
to expand jobs since they will be
cautious in the face of slow
growth and will emphasize
productivity and working more
hours rather, than hiring,” Bangs
said.

He also said not to expect
outside firms to create jobs in
Pittsburgh because this strategy
has not proven successful.
Advanced education and training
will not produce‘ jobs either,
Bangs said, because the
Pittsburgh region already has an
abundance of educated and
skilled workers for
professions.

prospects,

ITIOSL "

The effects of agriculture on
the Pennsylvania job marketwere
also discussed by the panel.
“Pennsylvania has outperformed
the U.S. in terms of recent growth
in food-processing employment.
In the U.S., in total, food
processing and manufactur-
ing grew at about the same
rate. I

When we look at
Pennsylvania however, the food-
processingesector has added jobs
at a higher rate than either food
processing in the U.S. in total or
manufacturing in Pennsylvania,”
Penn State Associate Professor of
Agricultural Economicsjill Findeis
said during her report on
agriculture and food-processing
employment in Pennsylvania.

According to Findeis, one of
the main problems encountered
by farmers in general is a lack of
market access.

However Pennsylvania farms
have good markets in areas such
as Philadelphia and New York,
according to Findeis.

“Farms without access to the
relevant markets and suppliers
will find it increasingly difficult
to survive in states that are heavily
dependent on their non-
agricultural districts,” Findeis said.

“The outlook for the food-
processing industry in
Pennsylvania, Ibelieve, is good,”
Findeis said.

High Speed Rail Association
President Dr. Robert Casey
testified on the results of research
done for the Pennsylvania High
Speed Intercity Rail Passenger
Commission.

‘The PHSIRC commissioned
hundreds of studies to determine
the practicality, benefits and costs
of a high speed rail or magnetic
levitation (maglev) train system,
according to Casey.

According to the PHSIRC
report, some of the benefits of

high speed rail transportation for
Pennsylvania would be a cross-

» state travel time of two to three

hours, as many as 25,000 jobs
during its construction and
approximately 12,000 permanent
jobs during its operation and
revitalization of downtown
areas in cities with rail
terminals.

“At the time it was pretty much
agreed by all parties that this
project was important because it
had the potential to be the greatest
generator of jobs and economic
development in the history of the
commonwealth.

Not just in the past 10 years,
and not 100 years, but the whole
history since Ben Franklin was
governor,” Casey said.

Martha Lester Harris, vice
president at the Technology
Development and Education
Corporation of Pittsburgh,
presented a proposal which
would help small and medium
sized manufacturing firms
become more competitive by
adopting new" manufa‘ctu»ring-‘

’ methods and technologies.

Designed to encourage and
motivate high school students to
graduate from high school and
pursue a secondary education,

. the Upward Bound Project at Pitt

helps area students from low-
income families further their
education.

“We provide the extra kick,”
said Dr. Renee Frazier, director of
the Pitt Upward Bound program.

According to Frazier, many
students have not challenged
themselves and buckled down.
“We are making a strong,
concerted effort to get the [proper]
attitude,” she said.

To be eligible for the federally
funded program, students must
be enrolled in Pittsburgh public
high schools, be from low—income
families or the first generation to
be college bound. They must
also demonstrate academic need,
Frazier said.

During the regular school year,
the Upward Bound Project
provides tutoring for its students

four days each week. The I
program provides seven to eight '

tutors that cover the entire gamut
of high school subjects. Those
students with a “C” or below in a
subject at school must come in
for mandatory tutoring.‘

During the summer, Upward
Bound has a mandatory ﬁve— to
six—week program at which the

students receive instruction for
the courses they will be taking in
the fall.

This summer, the Upward
Bound Project has 52 students. “I
think they are very excited to be
down here. They have that
anxious feeling,” said Sonya
Bundridge, head female tutor
counselor for the summer
program. “So far [this summer]
has been good.”

In addition to the summer
courses, there are a number of
college courses offered to recent
high—school graduates in the
program.

The Bridge Program allows
those between high school and
college to take University of
Pittsburgh courses which will
transfer to other colleges or
universities.

“The Bridge Program is good.
It is very helpful. It allows me to
take up to nine college credits,
for which the government pays.
It allows us to get ahead,” said

- Angela Hatcher, a current Bridge

student who is entering

« Duquesne University this fall.

Instructors benefit from the
program as well, according to

_African-American history and

English instructor Linda Bailey.
“It’s self—rewarding  It has

definitely been a positive.

experience. It gives me
encouragement to keep on
teaching. I feel like [the students]
are getting something from me,

said.

The program provides advising
and counseling for the students.

“I think [all the students] have
the potential to succeed. Listening
and advising is part of our job.
Sometimes [the students] just need
someone to listen to them,” said
ninth- and tenth-grade counselor
Charlotte McDonald.

The Pitt Upward Bound Project
currently recruits from Pittsburgh
public high schools and
designated non—pub1ic high
schools in the area.

“We’ve had numerous success
stories,” Frazier said. “[The
students] have understood what
they have learned.”

The city needs many more
programs like Upward Bound,
according to Frazier.

“There’s a need for more
programs in the city, ” Frazier said.
“Our youth need us desperately.
There are a lot of people doing
positive things in this city. In an
environment in which we are
being challenged and tested, we
need each_ other’s support.”

Knowledge
of self sought
at symposium

By Edward Goldhahn
saw" Writer

Looking for special individuals
who want to know more about
themselves, the Self ‘Knowledge
Symposium meets weekly to
discuss truth and knowledge,
according to group member
David Gold.

“Our meetings are like Weight
Watchers. If you come in here
and don’t put forth any effort,
you’re not going to lose any
weight,” Gold said.

The self-knowledge group
consists of a mixture of students
and non-students and provides
them with a meeting place to
discuss and share ideas about
various aspects of their lives.

“There’s no doubt that the better
you know yourself, the better
you’ll be able to interact with
others,” Gold said.

Since the group started in
Pittsburgh two months ago, it has

, attracted interested seekers of

knowledge of all ages, held
weekly meetings, sponsored
weekend retreats, hosted public
lectures and made “hard—to-find”
books accessible to group
members.

According to Gold, attending
the meetings is the first step in
“cleaning u p your act. The clearer
your thinking is, the clearer your
life is going to be,” he said.

City Council member, Oakland
Directions fight to clean up area

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

City council member Gene
Ricciardi’s quest to form a task
force to deal with South Oakland’s
problems ended as he joined
forces with an existing group.

Ricciardi proposed forming a
South Oakland Task Force to
Mayor Sophie Masloff. Many of
the issues Ricciardi wanted a task
force to address are already being
addressed by Oakland Directions,
Inc., according to Sandra Phillips,
vice president of ODI.

“ODI functions as the task force
[would havel,” Phillips said.

Ricciardi was not able to be
reached for comment on the
program. He did mention many
of the problems he wanted
addressed in a memo torMasloff.

“The Oakland neighborhood,
in particular South Oakland, is
experiencing unbearable
nocturnal disturbances such as
loud and crowded parties,
underage drinking, litter, and
graffiti," overflowing dumpsters,
and code violations,” Ricciardi
stated in his memo.

Ricciardi was invited to an ODI
board meeting June 25 to discuss
the proposed South Oakland Task
Force. Phillips said Ricciardi is
now coordinating his efforts with
those of ODI.

The code violations are the
main issues for Phillips. She

pointed to lax enforcement of
existing laws by the city and the
county as a major problem. She
said there is a need for city
building inspectors and county
health inspectors to start
enforcing those laws consistently,
not just when a public outcry or
pressure from government
officials forces them to do it.

“Getting those things taken care
of wouldbe a giant start,” Phillips
said. “If the citywould enforce
the laws, Oakland would function
better."

Substandard housing as ‘well
as truck route and parking
violations are specific issues that
Phillips wanted to address, she
said. The housing problems could
be solved by enforcing building

codes, especially in places with
absentee landlords, according
to Phillips. She also called for
the city to do something about
other abuses in Oakland.

"Trucks aren’t supposed to go
through a residential area of
Oakland, but they do," Phillips
said.

Phillips said ODI has been
working on many different
projects in order to improve
Oakland. “The post office on
Bouquet Street is causing terrible
traffic,” Phillips said. “Employees
aren't supposed to park there,
but they do.”

Neither the police nor the post
office will do anything about the
problem, according to Phillips,

Contract disputes between members of the Service Employees
International Union at Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic and
Presbyterian University Hospital have been amicably resolved,
according to union administrator Marty Cohen.

“We got 100 percent. There are virtually no changes in the ,

contract,” Cohen said.

The dispute began in May, four months after the three—year
contract was signed, when Presby attempted to limit sick days,
holidays and bereavement leave. “I think this is a testament to
what can happen when working people stand together,”Cohen
said.

The resolution was reached late last month. Cohen said
support from campus groups including the United Faculty,
Building Trades Council and the Pennsylvania Nurse Association

Forty-three percent of the

Photo exhibit
recalls life in
a Steel Town

By Megan Bertino
Editor in Chief

The cold remains of the giants
that once ruled western
Pennsylvania are showcased in
the ‘Prick Fine Arts Gallery's
exhibit Steel and Silver,
Photographers Commemorate
Homestead.

The retrospective explores the
remains of the fierce steel mills
that were once powerful enough
to blacken the afternoon sky but
now lie defunct in ruins
overgrown by weeds and covered
by _trash. It also examines the
people whose lives are and were
affected by the powerful but now
crippled steel monsters.

Photos by Lewis Hine, taken
during the first decade of the
century, remember the pain and
the pride of the steel mills. He
shows defeated men who had
lost a limb due to industrial
accidents and the proud faces of
immigrant steel workers. But the
most memorable photo in the
Hine series shows a proud, strong
man identified as “a genuine
American.”

William Wade’s series One
Night at a Mill Hunk Bar gives
the viewer a personal look at the
men who are desperately trying
to hold onto a vanishing way of
life. And Sue Wrbican shows
children and young adults who
will never experience life in a
mill town butwill only hear stories
of dark days and cloudy skies.

Pamela Bryan's photos breathe
a touch of life back into the mills
by coloring them with fiery reds
and fierce greens. But the viewer
is quickly reminded of the
passage of time and the mortality
of even the strongest structures
in Karen Kaighin’s photos, which
move with surprising and
unsettling energy.

But in direct contrast with
Kaighin’s work, Charlee Brodsky
shows a neighborhood time
forgot in his series Homestead
1987-1991. The photos show a
neighborhood caught in a
different generation, subject to a
way of life foreign to the new
yuppie generation evolving in
western Pennsylvania.

Planet of the apes

The successful transplant of a baboon liver to a human,
performed recently at Presbyterian University Hospital,
may motivate some entrepreneurial farmers to consider
raising baboons instead of cattle.

Transplant surgeons would be able to schedule their
operations if baboons are used instead of human donors.
Like most doctors, transplant surgeons prefer scheduling
operations at their convenience. Scheduling is one reason
obstetricians prefer Caesarean surgeries over vaginal
births for delivering babies, even when the mother can
deliver vaginally.

Many of the transplant patients who need a liver are
suffering from hepatitis B, which destroys human livers.
Baboons are immune to this disease, and a baboon liver
can survive longer inside a human with hepatitis B than
a human liver transplant. -

Members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
an animal-rights group, feel that raising baboons and
using them for human transplants is exploitative. PETA
members also believe that it is risky for baboon tissue to
be transplanted into human beings, and they question
how informed patients are about those risks. For once,
PETA seems to be almost as concerned about people as
animals. Six previous recipients of baboon livers have
died.

The quality of life of the liver-transplant patient is
questionable. Transplant patients must take a complex
combination of drugs to prevent their bodies from
rejecting the transplanted organ. These medicines often
have serious side effects. Transplant patients may live a
few weeks, months or years after their surgery, and the
stress of living in fear of an organ rejection takes its toll.

Thomas Starzl, the University of Pittsburgh surgeon
who performed the transplant, said raising baboons
would allow for “a predictable, ready supply of organs.”
He said fewer people would die waiting for operations.

It is still difficult to get people to agree to allow the liver
or heart of a dying relative to be used for a transplant.
Many people oppose removing body organs from a dead
person. Since baboons have no human voice, the PETA
group stands in as their nearest relative, joining the fray
shouting “No!” to transplants.

If baboons are raised for future transplants, their
caretakers should be strictly regulated to prevent the use
of fast—growth hormones or other drugs that may injure
the animal or the future organ recipient. The animals
should be raised humanely. ‘

Currently human organs are donated for free. The
medical costs of the operation exceed several hundred
thousand dollars. Although it will be convenient to have
baboons available, further costs will be incurred. The
medical system and federal regulatory agencies must
address who will be responsible for these costs. Therefore,
limits should be set on the profits so that the surgery does
not become completely unaffordable, just as it becomes
more available.

Anti-gay bigotry ,bolllute’s’Oregon

It was bad enough when on May 19 the citizens
of Springfield, Ore., voted to outlaw civil rights for
gays, but now a movement is seeking to invoke a
ban with an initiative on a statewide level.

Throughout the spring, gays in Springfield lobbied
for an anti-discrimination law but were granted the
opposite in one of the United States’ most oppressive
laws against gays.

The Springfield legislation prohibits the city from

Norman of Campaign for a Hate-Free Oregon said.

No local, state-or federal government has a right
to cast moral judgments on private matters. Declaring
homosexuality an “abnormal behavior” would not
only be wrong, the action would extend beyond
reasonable and constitutional authority granted to
government.

A person’s sexuality isn’t normal or abnormal —
it just is. If a man or woman desires to have sex with
another man or woman, it’s their

passing or enforcing any law “that
recognizes any categorical
provisions such as ‘sexual
orientation,’ ‘sexual preference’
or similar phrases  nor shall the
city of Springﬁeld, its agencies,

prerogative. Governmerit also has
no right to ban persons from
teaching or any occupation based
on their moral judgments.

departments, bureaus, properties -
or monies be used to promote, encourage or
facilitate homosexuality.”

This law legalizes discrimination against gays in
any area, including jobs, housing and education. It
allows any city agency to refuse services to any gay
political or religious organizations and non-gay
groups that openly support gay rights. It also
requires public libraries to remove any materials
that treat homosexuality in a positive or neutral
manner. The law is affirmative discrimin-
ation..

In an exit poll, voters said they did not want to
give gays special rights, but they used the “special
rights” rhetoric as a smoke screen to carry out their
prejudices against gays and anyone supporting
them.

Rather than conveying disagreement with being
gay, anti-gay groups gain support by deceiving
people into thinking gays want some type of
“special rights.”

Having a home, going to school and making
money are not special rights. These are human
rights, and every person deserves the freedom to
enjoy these without a hassle, which has become a
denied reality in Oregon.

Another extreme the to which Springﬁeld voters

have gone is the censoring of public libraries

concerning any gay material other than anti-gay
material. This is a clear violation of every American’s
constitutional right to free speech and privacy.

The city says it will not enforce the law, but this
seems untrue considering the current push for
deeper initiatives and state-wide discrimination
against gays.

Led by the Oregon Citizens Alliance COCA), there
will be a statewide ballot in November that, if
passed, would legalize discrimination against gays
on a statewide level, declare being gay “abnormal
behavior” and force public schools to discourage
homosexuality, including banning gay teachers.

The vote is expected to be close, but if it passes,
“We will be . the first state to change its state

-.const.itI4ti9n. to mandate ..dis.<=réItIir!'«!ti9!',” Psssv

Credit for the movement
to ban gays from teaching in Oregon lies in the
citizens’ homophobia, which manifests itself in
groups like the OCA. “As role models, they are too
influential,” Lon Mabon, chairman of the OCA, said.
Qualities like honesty, responsibility,
trustworthiness, motivation and fairness make up a
role model, and anyone can embody these. A
Despite what Mr. Mabon and his group of
oppressive homophobes think, being gay is not

contagious; it’s not going to rub off on Oregon’s

youth.

If kids had more exposure to gays and less
negative input from all the homophobic elements
in society, they would grow to be secure and
comfortable in their own sexuality and everyone
else’s.

Prejudice that is the product of distance and
dissociation displayed in people like Mr. Mabon
and the rest of Oregon’s anti-gay movement would
be absent.

A substantial part of the anti-gay movement's
ideology lies in its view that being gay is immoral.
It attacks gay people in an attempt, in its view, to
bring more morality to society. But even if being
gay was imnioral, the immorality of the homophobic
OCA would outweigh it dramatically. ,

Manipulation through “special rights” rhetoric,

censorship of libraries, oppression by restricting,

free speech and privacy and endangering thousands
of citizens by making it legal to ﬁre them, evict them
and deny them education are all immoral acts that
the anti-gay groups have implemented for the vain
sake of morality.

But that is not the worst of it. One act shows the
greatest morality‘ of all, one principle is most
important, and it would be logical to assume that
-the morality crusaders personify it.

Love and acceptance of all people, no matter
who they are and what they are like, is a principle
the anti-gay moral crusaders can't comprehend.

Their hypocrisy is shameful.

If Eddie Murphy’s ﬂorid ego is any
match for his sexual prowess in
Boomerang, then it’s nice to know that
Murphy has deﬂated his self—admiration
for more genuine qualities. And if Murphy
is indeed in his self-wont period, then his
latest cinematic offering may be the piece
that puts him back in touch with his
recently displaced fans.

Who can deny that the billion-dollar
man had slipped? “The No. 1 comedy star
in the world” boasts the press kit, but the
powerful urban comic sense that brought
Murphy to the top may have alienated his
followers, as he was railed and sued for
stealing the script for Coming To/imerica
and then blasted for another self—bow in
Harlem Nights.

, So, isn’t it interesting that Murphy
may be regaining his wider appeal (first-
week receipts of Boomerang have it
earning nearly $14 million. Not sensational,
but a welcome re-introduction) in an all-
black production? The film’s appeal lies
not in the colorization but in its universal
themes, all of which are addressed and re-
addressed with a well-crafted script.»

Marcus Graham (Murphy) is a suave,
slippery cosmetics company executive who
is a magnet for seductive, long~legged
women. He is the ultimate womanizer, at
least by male-fantasy standards, able to
pull and release females with quicktongue
and =:ro'§l;r1antic,§°(3tio5"r1, ’ -' "

In one hilarious interlude he chases
down an upscale female and her dog by
pretending he's lost his pooch. She (Lela
Rochon) is quickly enticed by Marcus’
charm, and later that evening he lies to
her, saying he's been hurt in a relationship
and hasn’t been with a woman for two
years. ‘

Ultimately, the plot must move from its
stereotyped views of females and the
playfully garnish doings of Marcus, for
Cupid must come for this film to work.

And does he ever, in the form of Robin

Givens (Jacqueline), who standsproudﬁas .

a bull asiwefﬁrst see her screen presence.

Quayle style:

By Michelle Kleinsak

Director Reginald Hudl_in -(left) and Eddie Murphy, laughing all the way to the bank.

Initially, she is just another conquest for
him, a “bad” woman with powerand an
abundance of sex appeal, but as the story
unfolds, it it is Jacqueline who is able to
put the devastating role—reversal effect on
Marcus, giving him a taste of his own
broken—hearted medicine. Herein lies the
film’s main themes, which harbor on love
and all that it takes to find it and keep it.

Marcus is soon trapped with an
overwhelming love — it’s no longer lust
— forJacqueline. But as she plays him, he
moves in with the lovely Halle Berry
(Angela), a top—notch artist at the
corporation, who happens to be

-.Jacqueline’s friend as well as an interest of .

Marcus’ buppie’ buddy, Gerard (David

Alan Grier).

The whole relationship thing is perfectly
realistic, although the psychological
makeup and analysis is left faintly in the
background, particularly in Marcus’
blossoming relationship with Angela.

The love and sex‘ are ‘dangerously
impulsive, from Marcus’ initial romp with
Jacqueline to his fresh-out—of—bed
encounter with Angela. -

As the film seems to lean toward the
eternal “love comes and goes, but you
always got your boys” theme (as evidenced
by Gerard’s willingness to forgive Marcus),
it shifts in definition to the all-encompassing
omnipotent love theme, which Marcus
can’t seem to avoid since meeting

   What comes around goes around for Eddie Murphy

Jacqueline and Angela.

All the intricacies are in place, right
down to the revenge motif, which is
parlayed in the back of the viewer’s mind
throughout the film, then given a subtle
treatment as Jacqueline and a bevy of
beautiful secretaries laugh at Marcus as he
enters his lavish New York office. The
scene doesn’t directly announce a female
rebellion againstMarcus, but the inferences
are enough to push the sex—drenched plot.

Directed by Reginald Hudlin (House
Party and the soon to be released Bebe’s
Kids), the screen is in rapid motion,
breaking only for more tender, or frustrated,
verbal jockeying. The sets, filmed entirely
in New York, are lavish as well as stylish.

Some of the true highlights are the film’s
outrageous props, like the royally French
decor of the mysterious Lady Eloise’s
mansion‘, which provides the setting for
one of the film’s classic Murphy skits. As
the Lady, complete with silk lingerie and
purring, entices Marcus, she sets the mood
further by retiring the lights courtesy of the
ever-handy Clap Off system.

The fun never ends, as Hudlin introduces
a litany of characters who act out their chic
gaiety with precision. Grace"Jones plays
the supermodel Strange with a cockiness
that is as bold and blatant as it is ego-
trippin’. She boasts that no man can resist

her and pulls off her panties in a bourgeois
restaurant hollering and openly fingering
out gay men in the audience.

Givens’ performance as Jacqueline is
barely acceptable, though. Her steamy

. looks and seductive appeal are all that she
has to offer. Her acting is pathetic, as she
emphasizes all her words with a sarcasm
that is out of place. But Halle Berry shines
as the humane female of the lot, full of
compassion, but with a mean streak that
even Marcus can’t deny. ‘

Murphy isn’t center stage in this one —
compared to past performances where his
ego ‘seems to control the screen —— and
much of that is due to the outstanding cast
and a plot that allows him to joke along
with his cronies, not upstage them. The
result is a perfect wiry to welcome Murphy
back from the mountain.

Sum Of Us and traditional family values

Stajf Wruer

Rarely in television and film do
we see parents portrayed as all-
accepting and all-understanding.
That's why there’s something
sweetly odd and beautifully
unnatural about David Stevens’s
play The Sum of Us, currently
running at the Pittsburgh Public
Theater.

The play centers around Harry
Mitchell and his son, Jeff. The
action takes place in Melbourne,
Australia, where they share a
house and the same feelings of
loneliness. Harry’s wife has
passed away, and Harry has taken
on the sole responsibility 0
rearing Jeff. "

The main value that Harry
instills inJeff is the importance of
love. He tells Jeff that “the worst
thing a human being can do is
forget how to love.” He
incessantly teases Jeff about
finding that certain someone and
settling down. Like most 24-year-
olds, Jeff often grows tired of

hearing it.

Sounds all too familiar, right? A
pushy widower and father tries to
pair off his only son, encouraging
him at every corner to stop
slacking around the house and
become an active participant in
life. The catch to all of this is that
Jeff is gay and Harry’s
straightforward acceptance of it
leads to some pretty comical
situations.

For instance, when Jeff brings
home a gardener named Greg
whose life’s dream is to plant a
forest, Dad interrupts a bit of
action and wants to know how
Greg likes his coffee in the
morning.

ButJefPs not the only one with
a love interest. Harry takes some
of his own advice and calls a
dating service, where he meets a
voluptuous, redheaded divorcee
named Joyce. Both father and
son are forced to make decisions
regarding their own happiness,
and both allow their judgment to
be clouded by how the outcome
will affect the other.

The message behind the title of
the play is that we are the sum of
all the generations that have come
before us. The play is loaded
with monologues about
loneliness, saying goodbye to
loved ones, and strange women
with “hair dyed colors God never
intended for human beings”
wailing about the agonizing pain
of it all on midnight trains. Most
of the characters ramble about
dead people whom the audience
never see. They are relevant to
the story, but talking about things
that happened 50 years ago
considerablyslows down the pace
of the play.

Marshall Mason's direction is
strikingly original right from the
start, when a girl dressed as an
Australian football referee blows '
her whistle and a pseudo-game
commences under a flood of blue
strobe lights. The effect of the
lights makes the players and the
cheerleaders move through space
in slow motion while the droning
beat of Queen's “We Will Rock

, CLO delivers an unﬂinching Superstar

By Lori M. Bossert
Sta_[)" Writer

Jesus Christ Superstar, by
Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim
Rice, has the distinction of being
one of theater's most controversial
musicals in history, largely
because of its sexual overtones
and a portrayal of Christ which
centers upon his humanity.

Superstars Jesus is doubtful
and tormented, unsure of the
path he is following and
shadowed by the knowledge of
his eventual fate. Director Charles
Gray and the Civic Light Opera
deliver a hard—hitting, unﬂinching
interpretation of the rock opera
which centers upon the conﬂicts
created by Christ’s dual nature -

—— the human and the divine.

The production draws its beauty
largely from its simplicity. Stage
effects are kept to a minimum
until the cataclysmic ending,
allowing the cast’s talents to shine
through. And shine they do; this
is a phenomenal show, resting

mostly upon the actors. Most of
the action takes place on a multi-
leveled stone platform, backed
by large projections of the sky,
clouds and stars.

Kim Strauss makes a haunted
Jesus, ridden with fear and
longing. His taut, focused
performance rarely breaks the
aura of tension which surrounds
his character. One of his best
moments occurs when a crowd
of grey—bandaged lepers

converges on Jesus. They wail
and writhe toward him, arms
outstretched, bandages trailing.
Strauss’s tormentedJesus huddles

at the center of this, moaning his ,

lyrics to the climactic cry of “HEAL
YOURSELVES!” which ends the
scene. The strain of his mission
overcomes him, creating one of
the show’s most striking
moments.

Strauss’s torment as Jesus is
echoed in Carl Anderson as Judas,
the show’s tragic hero. Anderson
gives an electric performance,
filled with raw energy and
frustration. Consumed by his
visions of what the Messiah was
to be and frustrated by Jesus’s
actuality, Judas is chased by two

‘faceless, demonlike “tormentors”

(Steve Geary and Thomas Terry)
throughout the play. T h e y
move sinuously about Judas as
physical representations of his
doubts, silently goading him into
his role as betrayer. Anderson,
who has played the role both on
Broadway and in the film version
of the musical. is the best actor in

a great show. His rendition of
“Damned for All Time” goes at a
fever pitch, reflecting the
indecision his character
experiences until his death.

Bertilla Baker, as Mary
Magdalene, is the calm center to
Jesus’s storms. Her tender,
melodious voice provides the
audience with a momentary
respite from the production’s
dominating tension. Baker
conveys Mary’s mixed feelings
forJesus well, expertly mingling
platonic, romantic and mystical
love. Excellent throughout the
performance, she shines
particularly on “I Don’t Know
How To Love Him” and the
lyrical “Could We Start Again,
Please.”

The various "Roman and
Hebrew officials are well-acted
and sung by William Parry
(Caiaphas), Gavan Pamer
(Annas), Scott Johnston (Pilate)
and Paul Ainsley (Herod). Parry
and Pamer are oily and officious
as the Hebrews, while Johnston
makes an apologetic Pilate.

NCAA eliminates coaching positions to cut costs

By Stephen Flinn
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

The happy-go lucky, wasteful, loose
attitude towards spending money which
took place in the "80s is over. The
buzzwords of the ’90s are attrition,
cutbacks, and spendthrift, just to name a
few. And universities around the country
are no different. The NCAA was quick to
recognize this, and thus adopted some
sweeping reforms involving all NCAA-
member sports teams. Among these
reforms come stricter limits on how many
coaches and assistants each sports team
may employ.

In January, 1991, the presidents of the
NCAA-member universities passed these
measures in an attempt to steer college
athletic department spending back toward
sanity. These changes were prompted by
both athletic budgets in some schools

spiraling out of hand, and some institutions
being concerned with losing control of
their own athletic departments. This

budgetary problem coupled along with '

the loss of revenue from decreasing TV
rights fees and booster donations started
to pose a real problem for all universities.

The cost-cutting measures were put
into place to “help keep a level playing
field among schools." as stated by Larry
Eldridge, Pitt’s Sports Information Director.
Eldridge goes on to say, “The [broadcasting]
rights fees which were the golden eggs of
the '80s are over. Everybody is being
pinched by diminishing revenues, so the
NCAA is just looking ahead in its efforts to
cut costs and raise revenue.”

Apparently, a great deal of schools
around the country are facing serious
budget problems in their athletic
departments and Pitt is no different.
Eldridge said that few schools make money
in athletics anymore.

One of the areas hardest hit by the new
coaching cuts is the graduate assistant
position which is virtually being eliminated.
The NCAA member schools took into
considerationthat a great deal of programs
already had contractual arrangements for
their coaching staffs and also, most graduate
assistants only serve a year or two in most
cases.

For these reasons, the reforms passed
January 1991, are going into effect August
1, 1992 to allow schools an opportunity to
simply phase out the graduate assistant
position as opposed to mass layoffs by the
universities.

However, at Pitt, the non-revenue sports
for the most part were already under the
newly—installed restrictions. One example
is baseball.

“Pitt’s baseball team did not have a staff
as large as some schools, and it was
already complying with the new
regulations” said Ron Wahl, Pitt’s assistant

sports information director.

However, a sport hard hit by the loss of
the graduate position is men's basketball.
As stated byJim Marchiony, NCAA director
of communications, beginning August 1,
1992, the Division I basketball coaching
staff is to be limited to a total of three
head/assistant coaches plus one limited
earnings coach. The salary cap put on the
limited earnings position is $16,000 per
year. The limited earnings coach is taking
the place of both a graduate assistant and
a part time assistant on a basketball
team.-

The graduate assistant is the ideal place
for someone with coaching aspirations to
recognize if coaching is indeed his calling
in life.

“When you are forced to cut the graduate
assistants, you also cut a lot of guys’ route
to coaching,” Larry Eldridge, Pitt’s Director
of Sports Information said a recent USA
Today article.

Gymnasts

big s/9 oes

By Laini Samuels
For T be Pitt News

' The recruiting class of 1995 has
“big shoes to fill,” according to
women's gymnastics head coach
Debbie Yohman. The team has
lost four experienced and
se_asoned leaders. Jennifer
Butkovich, Tracy Jung, Jeannie
Vecchio and Gina Venezia all
graduated this spring, but
Yohman remains optimistic about
the future.

Four freshman recruits for the
1995 gymnastics team signed
letters of intent to attend Pitt this
fall. Brenda Stevens signed in
November during the early
signing period. “Everyone with
the team is extremely excited
about these kids and looks
forward to working with them,”
Yohman said.

Stevens is from Boyertown Area
High School in Frederick, Pa.,
and has studied and competed
with Berks Gymnastics Academy.
In 1991, she won the state
championship on the beam.
Yohman is looking for Stevens to
compete as an all—around athlete,
with her strengths on the beam
and the uneven bars.

Joining Stevens are Deena
Daller, Tracy McKenna and
~Bethany Toellner.

Yohman is “looking forward to

that have this thing about
actually witnessing pro-
fessional baseball at its finest
— not Pittsburgh.

Here it’s all about having the
privilege to play in the city of

special.

To play in the same stadium
that once was home to the
dynasty Steelers of the '70s —
that’s enough honor as it is. For
Pirates to expect more— like,
say, 2.5 million fans— surely
you jest! A ‘ A

The formula is simple: lore

A of other sports precedes the

accomplishments of the
present—day Bucs.

Forget the fact that the Pirates
boast the best player in
baseball, the best defense in
baseball and the best manager
in baseball-.—— the Bucs need to
win Super Bowls or Stanley
Cups before realistic goals like
selling out playoff games can
be attained. '

The predictable monotony
of diving catches in left and
center field, the repetition of
weekend sweeps over rivals
like the Mets — it’s all too
much to comprehend
and appreciate in Pittsburgh,
Pa. .  
What ‘do you expect from
brainwashed citizens who still
have wet dreams about Super
Bowl X but can’t tell you who
plays third base for the
Bucs?

Now tberes a sight. Steve
Beuchele running around the

-bases with Lord Stanley’s Cup.

Maybe icing the Astroturf would
do it— that or leaving the goal
posts up all summer.

During the-wonderful 19705,
when the Pirates captured five

Too coincidental to be a fluke,

the game” clause, but he is
abusing that power. This comes
at a time when Vincent is still
under fire for reportedly telling
Yankee General Manager Bucky
Showalter and General Manager
Gene Michael they were ruining
their careers if they didn’t change
their testimony in the arbitration
hearing deciding the fate of
reliever Steve Howe. He simply
said it was a mistake. I doubt
it. 1
Vincent has the look of a man
who knows he is not long for his
job. He has little fear oflosing his
job, so he is doing everything he
can before leaving. A man with
the power he has and no fear of
retribution could do some serious
damage. I
One thing Vincent can’t change
is what the players do on the
field. The following is one humble
man’s opinion of the best and
worst of baseball’s first half.

Comeback player of the year:
Darren Daulton of the Phillies is
headed for the All—Star game
after hitting only .196 and
surviving a car wreck last season.
He barely edges out Cory Snyder’s
return from the dead for the
Giants.
Top rookie: Reggie Sanders has
gotten the attention, but Donovan
Osborne has been outstanding
as the No. 2 starter for St. Louis.
Top manager: With all due
respect to Bonds, Jim Leyland is
the reason the Pirates are still
contenders.
American League First Half
Awards:
MVP: Kirby Puckett and Roberto
Alomar are having great seasons’
on first-place teams, but McGwire

stolen bases, but shortstop Paul
Listach of Milwaukee gets the
nod. He has provided a spark as
the leadoff man for the resurgent
Brewers and has given them
decent play at a key position.

If that's not enough, here are a
few more awards for the true

Worthless trade of the year:
Mets trade has-been Tim Burke

Top free agent pick-up: Mike
Morgan finally has an impressive
record to go along with a low
ERA with the Cubs.

Free agent flop: Bobby Bonilla
hasn’t been terrible, but he isn’t
doing what was expected.

Dr. Strangegloye: The error
totals of Cleveland’s Mark Lewis,
18, and Jose Offerman of the
Dodgers, 17, are eye—catching,
but Howard Johnson has
embarrassed himself too many
times in centerfield to be ignored,

outfield is a candidate. So is Sandy
Alomar, who will be the AL
catcher ahead of sluggers Chris
- Hoiles and Mickey Tettleton.
The nod goes to San Diego’s
Benito Santiago. He has better
numbers than Alomar, but
Santiago still guns too many
throws into centerfield. Daulton
and Tom Pagnozzi are having
great years and should both be
there.
Managers who might be ﬁred:
Butch Hobson could be in trouble
in Boston. Injuries have ravaged
his lineup, but the team was
supposed to win and it isn’t. The
Mariners aren’t nearly as good as
they looked on paper, as usual,
so new skipper Bill Plummer
might be gone.
Manager who should be ﬁred:
Bobby Valentine of Texas has
been given far too many chances.
The Rangers have a devastating
offense and are getting solid
pitching, but they just can’t get it
all together.Cit_o Gaston of
Toronto is another guy who
should be replaced. The Blue
Jays win because they have an
obscene amount oftalent, but
Gaston can’t get them over the
hump to a world championship.
Leyland or La Russa would have
won the last two or three World
Series with this team.
Out of the blue: Mike Bordick
has gone from utility infielder to
.507 hitter for Oakland, finally
solving the long—standing
problem at second base.
But I thought he stunk: The ugly

twin of the “out of the blue”
award goes to Brady Anderson
of Baltimore. The once highly
regarded prospect was nothing
more than a strong defender with
a lightweight bat. Now he is
hitting .281 with 14 homers, 51
RBIs and 26 stolen bases.
Why should we care: So many
candidates, so little space. Why
does anyone care who leads the
National League in doubles?
Mariano Duncan of the Phillies is
doing it this year. Now you know
why I don’t care.

The Pirates traded for Alex
Cole and his .206 average to lift
their slumping offense. Well, at

least nobody has heard of the-

minor leaguers in the deal. so
that may be a good sign. ’
After all, the one thing that I
really don’t care about is the fact
that if the 1993 alignment for the
NL East, took effect now, the
Pirates would be tied for second

place, five games out ofﬁrst. And’

ifCole had been with the Bucs all
year it would have made almost
no difference at all, so who cares?
Out of control: Umpires are out
of control, taking on managers at
every opportunity, threatening
retribution if challenged" and
not throwing fans out of
games.

The sins of the umps pale in
comparison to Vincent’s recent
rampage. Forcing re—alignment
is just stepping on toes, but using
threats to manipulate testimony
in arbitration hearings borders
on criminal behavior.

Dream——

Continued from page 11

all the commercials and hype,
lighten up. For once, here’s a
squad that deserves every ounce
of hype it gets. It isn’t like the
commercials are weak either.
LarryJohnson’s latest grandmama
segment for Converse, the one
with Johnson telling little kids
about the Dream Team, is almost
as entertaining as the games
themselves.

This U.S. team isn’t about
revenge. It is not some criminal
plot by the U.S. Olympic
Committee to get the big payback
for 1972 and 1988. What this
team represents is pure
excellence, the American
excellence in basketball. It
boggles my mind that some would
rather send collegians to the
Olympics instead of this group.

Remember, in_ 1989 the
international basketball
committee voted yes to

professionals, and they gotexactly
what they asked for. The United
States voted against the idea.

The Olympic Games, like all
other sporting events, are held to
determine who is the best in a
‘ given competition. We have yet
to see Italy or Argentina send
their amateurs or second— or third-
line soccer players to the World
Cup Tournament. Does Germany
send its ninth- or tenth—best
bobsled team to the Winter
Games? They send their best and
build international powers in the
process. The U.S. has been on
the losing end in many other
sports, and nobody‘ has taken
pity. Basketball is the sport which
America owns.

Not a soul in the international
scheme of things has cried foul
on the Dream Team, just a few
annoying, unappreciative
Americans. There is nothing as
beautiful as ,watching a game
executed at its absolute highest
level. The 1992 U.S basketball
team is a once—in-a-lifetime thing.
People will be talking about this
team until the end of time. Let’s
just talk about their dominance
on the floor and forget everything
else.
