There is a refugee camp at
Carnegie Mellon University. ' '

A collection of tents, blankets and
one plywood shack has sprung up in
front of the famous CMU fence. But
the inhabitants are not ﬂeeing their
homelands or seeking cheaper on-cam-
pus housing. _ ,

The camp is an effort by the
Pittsburgh Anti-War coalition to col- ”
lect blankets for the refugees in 0

Afghanistan. Mark Egerman is a
CMU sophomore active in the
Pittsburgh Anti-War Coalition.

Egerman plans to spend four days (not

in preparation) in the makeshift camp, ' I 
until he takes it down on Wednesday.
The words “Refugee Camp” are
scrawled across the fence, adding ‘to
the huge peace sign blanket on the
ground and massive square banner that
reads, “Stop the bombing:'_7'.5 million
starving.” -

ASA holds
officer, chair
nominations

MELANIE DONAHOO
Staff Writer

As part of its ongoing effort to
become an official governance group,
Asian Student Alliance held nomina-
tions for officers and Chairpersons in
the William Pitt Union Monday night.

ASA Interim President Asish
Mitra explained that although Student
Government Board granted the group
governance status last spring with the
passage of Resolution 0002, the Office
of Student Activities is unwilling to go

bership is in place.

_ “We’ve received assurances [from
OSA] that our concerns will be met to
our satisfaction,” Mitra said.

Mitra said that ASA’s current offi-

further with the procedure until a .-
board of officers elected by the mem-

“If you spend the night, you get
painting rights to the fence,” Egerman

said. The fence and surrounding lawn '

are often the site of vigils and cam-
pouts, but this is the first time a
refugee camp has been set up there.

‘‘It’s usually the fraternities that
are out here, so it was great to have
something a little more meaningful,”
Egerman said.

The refugee camp began at 4 p.m.
on Saturday with a series of drum cir-
cles and sing—alongs that brought

images of other protest-filled decades
to mind. Since then, participants have
been collecting and sewing blankets to
send to Afghan refugees. ,

“The energy was so high that none
of us got to bed until very late,”
Egerman said. “It was a great feeling
because we’d had such a long day.”

‘Egerman, whose voice was already
showing signs of a cold on Sunday

morning,’ said that his constant pres-

ence is the exception. .
“We’re here 96 hours continuous-

ly, so people come and go, stop by for
a night or two,” he said.
He also said that the point of the

I camp was not to simulate refugee con-

ditions but to draw attention to a cause.

“We’re not trying to say that we
know what it’s like to be in a refugee
camp,” Egerman said, cradling his lap-
top and munching on a Powerbar.
“We’re’just trying to raise awareness.”

Egerman said that, among the

cers were not elected and are serving
as interim officers only.

According to Mitra, the new gov-
ernance status would give thealliance
more money to send students to lead-
ership conferences and implement new
programming.

“Govemance status will allow us‘

to put on more ‘diverse programming to
educate the campus and deepen the
understanding [of ASA],” Mitra said.

Israel strikes police building near Arafat’s headquarters

TRACY WILKINSON
Los Angeles Times

RAMALLAH, West Bank —— Israeli combat
helicopters Tuesday ﬁred missiles into a police
building 100 feet‘ from Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat’s headquarters while he was

' inside, part of an escalating military offensive

launched across the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Arafat wasn’t injured in the strike but abruptly
repaired to an underground bunker. The Israeli army

‘ said it wasn’t trying to hit Arafat, but the strike was

heavy in symbolic significance, in effect hitting the
Palestinian leader where he lives.

Elsewhere, Israel expanded its newly. declared
“war on terror,” launched in the wake of an espe-
cially devastating trio of Palestinian suicide bomb-
ings that killed 28 people in 12 hours over the week-
end. Tuesday"s strikes were wide in geographical
scope, with warplanes and helicopters bombarding
at least eight targets in five cities and towns.

In Gaza City, F-16 fighter jets reduced a police
headquarters to rubble, killing a policeman and a 15-
year-old boy, Palestinian residents said. Palestinian
hospitals. said more than ‘100 people were injured, 20
seriously, and that they included numerous school-

i children who were rushing home after the air raid

started.

The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
formally declared Arafat’s Palestinian Authority a
“terror-"supporting entity” earlier Tuesday, and
Sharon vowed to fight what Israel regards as Arafat-

sponsored terrorism “with all means at its disposal.”

Israel accuses Arafat of failing to rein in Islamic
militants who kill and maim Israelis.

In every case in 24 hours of raids, Israeli forces
attacked potent symbols of Arafat’s power or
Palestinian nationalism: police headquarters, his
personal aircraft, his airport.

Home runs to homework

‘The Old Lady of the Schenley’ ,

Though it was destroyed 30 years ago, Forbes
Field’s presence can still be felt in the area of
Oakland that is now Posvar Hall.

Go down there. Down the long corridor of
Posvar Hall you can find home plate laid into the tile.
Through the scratched Plexiglas cover you can see
the plate, tattered from cleats of numerous Hall-of-
Famers.

Go back outside. There is a line of brick in the
cement that demarcates the left-field wall. You can
follow it to a plaque of the exact spot where Bill
Mazeroski hit his historic World Series winning
home run in 1960. I

Cross the street and see the real beauty of what’s
left, the left-field wall. Behind the trees and the flag-
pole stands a part of a stadium once considered a
worldly marvel and the greatest in America. Feel that
old brick and rust posts, trace the numbers painted on
the wall that also watched Babe Ruth’s final home
run sail above.

This is the story of Forbes Field, and then Forbes
Quad, and now Posvar Hall. It is a microcosm of the
plight of the University throughout the last century.
How do you place a campus in the city and derive all
the benefits of a city, while at the same time remove
it from that city so that it is an entity all its own?

The answer, if there is one, is most certainly not
easy and is always controversial, and the story that
leads up to the University’s decisions in the late ‘50s
takes us all the way back to the turn of the 20th cen-

tury.

The Barney Dreyfus affair

In the early 1900s Barney Dreyfus was as vision-
ary as a baseball owner could ever expect to be.

By his 40th birthday, the Gerrnan-bom Jew ’had
already immigrated to America, owned two sports
teams, acquired a lasting friendship with Honus
Wagner, one of the" greatest second basemen
ever and, most importantly,
single-handedly invented the
World Series.

In 1899, Dreyfus
became the sole owner of
the Pirates when he left his
team of nine years, the
Louisville Colonels, with a boatload of dough and
some of his best players, and moved north to
Exposition Park on Pittsburgh’s North Shore.

In 1901 and 1902, his team was incredibly suc-
cessful, winning the pennant both times. When his
team did it again in 1903, he decided to up the stakes,
challenging the best team from the other baseball
league at time, the Boston Pilgrims of the new
American League. _

It was the first World Series.

And the Pirates lost.

But Dreyfus didn’t stop. In 1909, he decided to
build a new stadium for his team that would eclipse
anything this nation had ever seen in a sports facili-

Along with his wealthy friend, Andrew Carnegie,
Dreyfus decided on a location. Building would begin

of Schenley Farms. .

the land that was quickly being bought up for
University grounds. Dreyfus and Carnegie jumped
on the “land wagon,” if you will, and got
to work on plans for the first steel-framed,
three-tiered stadium. The ‘stadium was
named- after a British general from the
French and Indian War, John Forbes.-
. For more than 60 years, Forbes Field

stood in this area of rapid change and
1 growth, as a small college known ﬁrstpas
the Pittsburgh Academy and then the Western
University of Pittsburgh moved in right next door
with plans for the future.

Forbes Field and the World Series

In quantity and quality terms, Forbes Field went
up fast and beautiful. Construction crews began lev-
eling a ravine located smack in the middle of the site
on March 1, 1909, and the stadium seats were pol-
ished and ready for the first game on June 3, 1909.
That three-month construction periodis even more
remarkable when compared to the nearly two years it
took to erect PNC Park more than 90 years later.

It cost 25 cents to see a 3-2 opening ‘day loss to
the Chicago Cubs in what would become a sorry tra-
dition of losing stadium openers (decades later the
Pirates lost the opener of Three Rivers Stadium and
PNC Park as well). But while the fans were upset
about the loss, both they and the press marveled at

v - a . V . . . . . . . . . . .

The 1910 “Reach Guide”_ wrote, “For architec-
tural beauty, imposing size, solid construction and
for_public comfort and convenience, it has not a
superior in the world.” ' ‘

. ' Forbes Field had done more than create sporting
luxury — it had defined it. For the estimated $2 mil-
lion it cost to build, the ballpark offered elevators,
electric lights, telephones and maids in the ladies
room. It could hold more than 30,000 fans, and it had
box seats and grandstands. /

And yet it wasn’t all show. By the time the fall
classic rolled around, the Pirates were in ﬁrst place
again with a record of 110-42, and they were goir/1g"to
another World Series, this time against the American
League champion Detroit Tigers.

The series was a matchup, between two of the
best players the game had to offer — Honus Wagner
of the Pirates, and the smooth hitting but mean-as-
the—devil outﬁelder for the Tigers, Ty Cobb.

During that series, Cobb, who was known for
sharpening his cleats before sliding, was on first
base, staring down Wagner playing second when he
was recorded as saying, “Look out, Banjo, watch out,
you Krauthead, here I come, I’m coming down.”

When Cobb ran, Wagner caught the throw and
tagged Cobb right in the mouth. Cobb was safe, but
he was also sorry. ‘ 1

games (in earlier years it was the best

comfortably, and for the most part’
uneventfully, for the next 15 ‘years.

By 1925, the Pirates were 95-58,
and back on top, and Forbes Field
would host the World Series again. As

would face oneof the best players in
the game, pitcher Walter Johnson,
known as the “Big Train.”

As with the last series, this one
would go seven games. The Pirates

1 ‘went up against Johnson for the deci-

sive game, and they had already lost
twice to him this series.

V But the Pirates were on and

Johnson had to be taken out in the ﬁrst
. in what would end as a 9-7 win for the

Pirates. ,

Forbes Field saw its third series
two years later, when the Pirates (94-
60) took on what many sports histori-
ans refer to as the greatest team of all
time, the 1927 Yankees. The Pirates
were swept in four and. would not
return to this level for more than 30

years when the winds of_ change were '

already at hurricane status.

Harried students

get help from PPC

COURTNEY LYNN
Staff Writer

The room is crowded with people
covered in ﬂour. Someone yells from
the crowd,“Finals suck!”

Stress-free laughter ﬁlls the room as
students funnel ﬂour into balloons to
make stress balls at one of Pitt Program
Council’s Finals Survival Week events,
held in the Virilliam Pitt Union Monday

night. ‘

' PPC is holding a variety of events
this week that members say are guaran-
teed to help you relax. Throughout the
week, the organization will offer every-

’ 7 thing from tips to help students handle A

stress to free aerobics, movies, arts. and
crafts, and of course, food and drinks. .

All of the events are free to students
and are on a first-come, first-served
basis. The first 20 students to Thursday
and Friday’s events will receive a ﬁnals
survival kit ﬁlled with coupons, toys
and candy.

PPC will hand out rafﬂe tickets. at
every event, with the exception of
movies and the pie—eating contest. The

drawing will be held on Dec. 7 for a spe-
cial Finals Survival prize. Four winners
will receive free pizza, movie tickets or
a one—month membership to the X

. Shadyside gym.

Everyone is encouraged to check
out the events this week. But some stu-
dents need no encouragement.

, According to Leisure Learning
Director Jessy Pierce, some students

A were waiting to make a stress ball before

she even arrived at Monday’s event.
Freshmen Jasmine Pogue and

Shannon Spear attended that event.‘-

_Sitting at a ﬂour-covered table, Spear
said the event was messy. Pogue joined
in with a smile and said, “This is kind of
stressful.” _

Despite their playful complaints,
both agreed they had a good time and

plan on attending other events this

week, particularly the massage on
Friday.

PPC will also be holding study ses-_ ‘

sions in the William Pitt Union from
Dec. 9 through Dec. 11 from 10 p.m. to
2 a.m. Free food and drink will be pro-
vided.-

Bank offices in Ramallah, two
Israeli Cobra helicopters arrived
about 11 a.m. and hovered for a cou-
'ple of minutes. Guards at the com-
pound spotted the aircraft, a shout
went up, and men started pouring
out of the buildings.

Then, in quick succession, the
helicopters fired two missiles into a
police station at one corner of the
compound. A third -hit some distance
away. , .

Once the helicopters disap-
peared, wailing ambulances and sol-
diers in black ski masks ﬂooded the
scene to inspect the damage and
hunt for casualties. There were
none. The one-story stone police
station was left with a huge, jagged
hole punched in its side.

Arafat was meeting with aides
in his" headquarters about 100 feet
away when the helicopters
approached. Accompanied’ by- body-
guards, he took shelter in an under-
ground bunker, according to aides. ‘

A spokesman, Information
Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, said
Arafat took the attack‘. in stride.

Missileshit police station

“After all,” Abed Rabbo said, “he
endured three months of Israeli
shelling in Beirut.”

When Israel invaded Lebanon in
1982, Arafat, then based in‘ Beirut,
was repeatedly targeted by Israeli
forces — led then, .as now, by
Sharon. The two aging warriors
have always been bitter enemies.

Speaking a couple of hours after
the attack near his compound,
Arafat accused Sharon of sabotag-
ing the Palestinian leader’s tentative
efforts at cracking .down on
Palestinian terrorism. »

“Before this aggression started,
we had succeeded many had been ,
arrested,” ‘Arafat told CNN. “He is
escalating his military activities
against our people, against our
towns, against our cities, against our
establishments.”

At least 110 militants have been
arrested by Palestinian authorities,
according to both sides, but Israel
considers the arrests insignificant.

Also hit Tuesday were the
offices of Force 17, Arafat’s special
guard unit, which Israel has named

Sharon pressures Arafat

as a terrorist organization. And Israeli
tanks again entered Palestinian territo-
ry, coming to within half a mile of
Arafat’s compound in Ramallah.

Israel has embarked on what
Sharon describes as an unbridled ﬁght
for the country’s survival. The military
campaign was triggered by some of
the deadliest Palestinian suicide
bombings in years. More than retalia-
tion, Sharon’s ultimate goal may be to
marginalize Arafat once and for all,
many Israelis and Palestinians suspect.

Palestinian officials argue that
they had begun arrests of militants and
will now be hard-pressed to continue.
They charge that Sharon’s offensive is
destroying the very security forces and
infrastructure that must round up and
hold suspects. Plus, the Israeli military
actions make it even more politically
untenable for Arafat to arrest suspects
wanted by Israel.

“How can Israel expect us to take
measures to arrest people while they
are targeting our police centers?”
Abed Rabbo said. “This is not a war
against Hamas and terrorism. This is a
war against the Palestinian Authority,

a war to undermine President Arafat.”

"Israeli army spokesman Brig.'Gen.
Ron Kitrey said Hamas and’ Islan1ic
jihad targets weren’t attacked because
they have a “secret military structure”
that is difﬁcult to hit. Besides, he said,
the message is for the Palestinian
Authority.

“The purpose was to send a clear
military message:  ‘Friends, we’ve
had enough, take the responsibility
that you have and stop the terrorism,’”
he said.

The decision by Sharon’s Cabinet '

to expand and accelerate military
strikes on the Palestinians has placed
serious strains on the coalition govem-
ment. Sharon’s main coalition partner,
the center-left Labor Party, is consid-
ering quitting and. will meet
Wednesday to ﬁgure out its course of
action. ‘

“The prime minister and the radi-

cal right -believe that after they bring
Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to
their knees, they will succeed in
achieving an arrangement with other
Palestinians, on Israel’s terms,” said
Shlomo Ben-Ami, a Labor lawmaker

and a former foreign minister. “And ,

this is the terrible mistake.”

complaints he had received, many of
them dealt with the lack of realism. »

“We’re doing everything we can to
raise awareness without going to
extremes,” he said. “Personally, I don’t
think anyone in Afghanistan is going
to beneﬁt from me being a little colder
tonight.”

The refugee camp collected and
made a total of 25 blankets in its ﬁrst
24 hours, with several more awaiting
completion.

“What we hope is students, if
they’re on their way to class and they
have an extra ﬁve minutes, can tie

some of these up or do a little sewing.” _

Calling the camp a “humanitarian
effort,” Egerrnan said that it is not a
protest against the war, despite popular
perception. ,

“I don’t know who opposes aid to
refugee camps, but there are some peo-
ple who have misinterpreted us,” he
said, but later added, “if we care about
aid to the refugees, we have to stop the
bombing.” .

Greg Pason, a self-proclaimed
“outside agitator” from New Jersey,

related a story about a Vietnam veteran
he had met Saturday night who is now
collecting blankets at his store.

“It’s fascinating to see some of
this, and people who you wouldn’t
otherwise think would be supporting
us coming out to help,” Pason said.

Also present was Tim Vining,
executive director of the Thomas
Merton Center, who said that the
humanitarian cause was indistinguish-
able from the peace effort. 1

“A11 war causes a humanitarian
disaster,” Vining said, “and all war
causes suffering.” '

Egerman said that the opposition
he had received was largely respectful.

“Most people agree with what
we’re trying to do,” Egerman -said.
“They may not agree with our method-
ology, they may not agree with our
message, but they agree with our sen-
timent.”

Quinten Steenhuis, a CMU sopho-
more and campus representative for

the Green Party, also said that the

interactions had been productive.

“The great thing was how many
people came up to us and talked and
learned a little bit,” he said.

ASA elections will facilitate governance decision

ASA, page 1 I '

Shahrooz Bhopti, former president
of Asian Students Association, which
is different from the new alliance, said
he once joined SGB in order to help
realize some of the programming goals
of the association. Bhopti said it was
almost, impossible to get anything
accomplished.

“Within the first couple weeks
therewere a lot of walls smashing in
my face,” Bhopti said. “There was no

real avenue to get things done.”

The new governance status would
make the alliance the recognized gov-
erning body for Asian students, Mitra

_said. Other Asian student groups,

including Hindu Students Council and
Chinese American Student
Association, have already pledged
their membership to the alliance.
During the meeting, Mitra passed
around copies of the -alliance’s tenta-

tive_ constitution. According to Mitra,

the constitution, which explains the

goal of the alliance and the functions of
both the boards and the officers, is
undergoing some minor language
changes._

Mitra also explained the function-
ing of the alliance, and how the two
boards — the executive and member
boards, — would interact with one
another.

Although there were only about 20
students in attendance, Mitra explained
that the meeting was mostly in order to
accept nominations. I

Mitra said that after the election he

“Because we’re in a transitional
stage, most students don’t know what’s
going on and need a definitive

Elections for alliance officers will

Americans must learn about Islam

Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
Americans have discovered that we know
little about the Islamic world and the
Middle East. Perhaps some of you don’t
even know why we are using the terms
Middle East and Islamic world separately.

Every night for years we’ve heard on
the evening news about something happen-
ing “over there.” But now that it’s hit home
we’re ﬁnding ourselves challenged when it
comes to answering why.

Pitt and other universities _,are doing
something to alleviate this lack of inforrna-
tion. According to the Dec. 2 Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, Pitt and other schools are
adding several new courses "on the Islamic
world and the Middle East for the spring
semester.

For example, in the spring you can
now take Politics of the Contemporary
Middle East, which is cross-listed as HIST
1763, PS 1383 and JS 1383. Religion in
India 2'(I-HST 1758, RELGST 1510), a
course traditionally offered, focuses on the
Indian subcontinent, including Muslim
inﬂuences.

Several Jewish studies courses also
focus on Israel and the Middle East, and the
linguistics department even offers Arabic.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, the religious studies department is
considering adding a Koran as Literature
course to complement the already-popular
Bible as Literature.

A course on the Nationality Rooms,

focusing on the cultures the rooms repre-
sent, would also be valuable to add. This
course could give students a general under-
standing of many cultures that they would
not otherwise receive.

Our leaders continually emphasize to
us that we will be involved in the Islamic
world for a long time. To keep an informed
debate on this subject continuing,
Americans need to make an eﬁort to learn
more.- "
Students are in a privileged position as
our job, in essence, is to learn. We should
take advantage of this. Even if a course on
Islam ‘or the Middle East does not fulﬁll
any requirements for you, does not “count’ ’
if you will, you should still take it. It will
“count” in making you an informed person.

While the addition of some courses on
Islam and on the Middle East is a good
start, Pitt needs to add more. For example,
the Post-Gazette reports that West Virginia
University is adding 35 for next semester
alone. Pitt should make a comprehensive
effort to attract ‘faculty with expertise on
Islam and on the Middle East and add more
courses in this ﬁeld.

Pitt is renowned for its intemational
studies programs. Yet CAS students can
take very few international studies courses
to fulﬁll requirements, and business and
engineering students are required to take
even fewer. This should change. As our
society becomes more‘ international, so
should our education.

THE PITT NEWS -

Car1’t rent ‘Shrek,’ can buy beer?

Last Saturday, I became my own legal guardian.
That’s right, little Sydney grew up, turned 18, and now

resides in a mountain of porn, getting tattooed and hav- ‘

ing people bring her contracts to sign.

After shedding my status as a minor, I can now

without parental consent. “With the exception of voting,
I could do these things before the clock struck mid-
night Nightclubs and nose rings have been available to
me for years. Carding policies fail to draw fear or even
respect when bouncers and piercers alike are willing to
make the ‘law go bye-bye.

involved.

So when my birthday rolled around, I approached
the whole ordeal with some skepticism. Watching the
clock round the bend into the ﬁnal countdown of the

1 1:503, the arbitrary nature of this rite of passage struck 0

me. As the clock hit 12 am. and armounced a new day
and a new age, I realized how artiﬁcial the concepts of
time and age truly were. »
What made my 18-year-old self any wiser or more
prepared for the world than my 17-year-old incama-
tion? Can I ﬁll out tax forms with greater ease and
assurance? Can I decide ifI should order glow—in-the-
dark Better Blocks from an infomercial at 3

A few weeks ago, for instance, I felt
just how sporadically enforced these
age limitations are. While zipping
around D.C. with a few friends, the
issues of age-speciﬁc privilege decided
to smack me around for a while. In the
course of the evening, I managed to pro-
cure enough beer to drown several

Butlcould not rent a video. bizarre responsibility of taking care of

Before anyone leaps to conclusions, this was not
an adult-type movie involving anyone named Debbie
or a certain city in Texas that begins with a “D” and
ends with an “alias.” It wasn’t even a movie geared
toward adults. In fact, the movie in question-
“Shrek”— is about a grumpy cartoon ogre and his
wacky adventures. He even has a sidekick—— a singing
donkey sidekick played by Eddie Murphy.

Why, therefore, could I not rent this kid—ﬁiendly,
upside-down fairytale? Lacking both a Blockbuster
card and the ability to sign legally binding contracts,
filling out paperwork with one of those silly pens
chained to the desk would have left me ink-stained and
videoless. ,

Thus, I acquired more beer than John Belushi on a
bender, but could not get my grubby, minor hands on a
children’s video. The situation made no sense. It was a
Dadaist’s wet dream, a twisted instance of irony and
absurdity that just was not comprehensible to any party

myself. Given my legal independence I feel somewhat
set adrift, like a lone adventurer on a shoddy wooden
raft without even a painted volleyball named Wilson
for comfort.

Still, on my birthday I felt thankful. Beyond the
ability to buy porn, purchase lottery tickets with those
cool silver scratch-off sections and, as one of my
friends pointed out, “Wow, now you can sleep with 90-
year-old rich men legally!” (I think he forgot to consid-
er the “ic ” factor), I am my own person — at least in
the eyes of the law. ’ -

And despite the arbitrary nature of the time select-
ed — though in Hebrew, the alphanumeric value for
the word “ ' e” is 18 — it feels nice to know that after
18 years, society now trusts me to rent f‘Shrek” without
parental consent. '

Columnist Sydney Bergman does not want any icky 90-
year-old men to contact her at sbb23 @pitt.edu.

 

Living wage will not make life
easier

As a student from the state of Oregon, the
state with the highest minimum wage in the
country, I feel it is my duty to help sort through
the so—called “living wage” issue. Living wages
hold the myth that they better the lives of every-
one involved, but this is not true. A living wage
causes changes in the economy, and the proof
can be found in prices in Oregon.

The highminimum wage has caused a glut
of high prices that ‘would not be stood for in
Pittsburgh. Oregon has some of the highest gas
prices in the nation. .

We had them before the gas crisis of a few
years ago, and they are still there. On Saturday,
gas could be purchased in Oakland for $.97 a
‘gallon. As of a week from Saturday, gas cost

‘cents for milk or an extra $1.20 for cheese?

$1.57 a gallon in Oregon.
And gas is not the only highly priced item.
How would you feel about paying an extra 50

And how about if those cushy in-state
tuition waivers were revoked as they were at
Eastern Oregon University? How many of you
would still be in college if it cost the full
$22,000 a year?

You can call me a right-wing radical. You
can say I am crazy. But you can’t argue with the
facts. If you increase the wage for the thousands
of University employees, you can look forward
to contending with Oregon for gas prices and
with private universities for tuition costs.

So know what you are arguing for before
you go to the next living wage march.

measures, but completely inaccurate. In fact, they’re often neg-
atively representative of virtue. Judgmental labels perhaps are
inevitable, but to me are beside the point.

Don’t get me wrong — I love having money. And I»
absolutely understand wanting to live a comfortable life with-
out doing more work_than is necessary. But I still hate money
itself. I work hard, but I play hard too. Wanting more makes us
so blind to enjoying what we’ve acquired.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with living the cliched
professional life of a doctorf lawyer or corporate or ﬁnancial
executive. . .

Plenty of professionals work passionately to contribute to
fascinating and noble endeavors such as science, art and peace.
Vtrrthin the “professional” realm, those who actually do mean-
ingful work rather than seeking the least strenuous jobs for the
most money exemplify the true ideal.

But if you’re working in a ﬁeld that just perpetuates a sys-
tem of retaining and accumulating wealth with very little prod-
uct or useful service rendered, admit you’re not doing it out of
humanitarianism or because you’re interested in it. .

Admit. th‘at~ you’ve bought into white-collar elitism and
materialism, because people who are sincerely passionate
about their lives and anyone other than themselves do their
work without looking forward to a cookie. Or a Lexus, for that

And don’t expect me to buy that simple-rninded, nose-up
approach to superiority. We hippies have more meaningful
lives than your useless six ﬁgures will ever understand.

As home to such prodigious

CLARE PERRETTA
Contributing Editor

Fans of both Robert Plant and sexy
women won’t be disappointed when
Nikka Costa performs Thursday at
Club Laga — if Robert Plant were a
sexy woman, he would look and sing
like Nikka Costa.

The daughter of Don Costa, the
arranger for the “Rat Pack’? — the
nickname for the famous late ‘50s col-
laborations between‘ Frank Sinatra,
Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin and
Peter Lawford —— Nikka‘Costa had a

hit record in Central and South
America and Europe when she was 8
years old; _ 4 ’ 2

S Twenty years later, Costa debuted

.- h_er=.first_ album,...Everyb0dy Got "Their
 Something, in the United States in

C if; .'_'_i-~'I‘h'e. first single, ,“LikeT.‘a F_eather,’.’
‘was’ the ' sensuous" bass—heavy‘ sound-‘

track - for fa‘ ‘Tommy Hilfiger" commer-
cial last summer. Costa’s
steamy video for the" single
featured the singer wailing
away in a barely-there top and
performing James Brown—esque tricks
with her microphone stand. Her song
“Push .and Pull” was alsoifeatured on
the soundtrack for the ‘movie “Blow.”
A notable performer on the album
is Ahmir Thompson, better known as
?uestlove, the solid drummer of the
clever Philadelphiaghip-hop outfit The

Roots. He brings a gritty backbeat to

an otherwise smoothly produced
album. Costa penned all the songs on
Everybody and shares co—producer
credit.

PI band conjures Pink Floyd’s
‘  ~ expansive symphonic sound

Nikka’s not
afraid to show’
you her more

sensual side. .

.Costa draws .on the inﬂuences of
the biggest bands of her ‘70s child-
hood. Plant, the dramatic Led Zeppelin
frontman, is the most palpable inﬂu-
ence in Costa’s singing style —
Costa’s thick, sexy voice takes on a
melismatic howl and operatic over-

tones in the compelling track “Tug of-
' War,” an ode to indecision ’about

whether to follow one’s heart.

thumping bass funk up “Hope It Felt’

Good,” a scathing diss of a ‘former
lover. Her heartfelt lyrics and Beastie
Boys samples represent ‘70s soul and
‘80s hip-hop’.

A venue like Laga is a good one
for Costa to showcase her live perfor-
mance skills. She puts on an intimate
stage show, backed by a five—piece
band. With» the addition of a live horn
section, she’ll ‘work herself and the
crowd up into a sassy, fiery frenzy. I

LISTEN

Dummy smacks

Pity the Fool J p 
Mr. Len. ‘ ‘-

Matador
sﬁriktk

For those of you who’ve never
heard of Mr. Len, he’s the former DJ
and producer of Company "Flow, a
Brooklyn—based independent hip—hop
outlet that functioned during the last six
years. Over this period’ the group
released . two albums, l997_’s
Fimcrusher Plus and l999’s Little
Johnny from the Hospital, as well as a
slew of singles. A '

On Pity the Fool, which is his ﬁrst
release since Company Flow’s split, Mr.
Len offers “experiments in therapy
behind the mask of music while handing
out dummy smacks,” as stated in the
liner notes.

As a whole, this is a pretty dark
record, but it still manages to traverse a
number of different musical styles.
Between the tweaks and scratches, we
find traces of funk, reggae, rock, soul,
techno and old—school hip-hop. “Force
Fed,” the album’s most out-of-place

. song, sounds like an “80s death metal

band that hired someone to rap the last
verse. _ _ .

I Thecast, which includes more than 
° a dozen-guest MCs, for tIlC‘_IJ1OSt: part -'
. . compliments Mr. Len7s mastery of the '
 f‘wheels7’of steel —the turntables. ‘ . J

‘ ' Thesef’MCs include the Juggaknots-,
Massinﬂuence, Mr. Live, Chubb Rock‘
y and, most prominently, Jean Grae, ‘who

performs on three of the ‘album’s 16

tracks. On the Columbine-esque “Taco '

Day,” Grae is a troubled teen who kills
her parents and shoots up her°high
school, and on the militant “Love

Venom” she declares “a venomous-A

revenge for offendin’ a feminine.”
Indeed, much of the rhymes on this
record, especially Grae’s, are venomous

and angry, but that’s not to say this ,

record doesn’t know how to party.

The funky “Girl (Got to Give. It to .

Me)” is an ode to sex with fat girls,
while “What the F@$k?!?” celebrates

the versatility of “the only word that is I

referred to as V
the ‘F—word.”’ -

Pity the Fool isn’t the greatest hip-
hop record I’ve"ever heard. The rhymes
aren’t incredibly shaking, and neither
are the beats. \

‘ But the good part about-this record
is that it gets serious without losing its
sense of humor, makes you laugh with-

out losing its intelligence, but most of

all, it parties like it’s 1979. - o

David Axelrod

MoWax Records
7,} .

If you were to describe David
Axelrod’s self-titled release through a com-
bination of genres, you might come up with
something like “jazz hip-hop fusion.” These
are two genres of music that, although dis-
tantly related, typically don’t compliment
one another well, and the tracks on this

album exemplify this relationship relatively

accurately.
The album opens with a track titled

 “The Little Children,” where a spoken-word

rapper taunts and threatens listeners _— and‘
their respective children, should they have
any — from behind an awkward bassline
and orchestra] violin and oboe arrangement
Much to listeners’ relief, a bluesy saxo-
phone solo reminiscent of jazzrnan Sonny
Rollins silences the rapper. Unfortunately,
fans of bebop will feel abandoned because
this is one of the few truly jazz —— and musi-
cally coherent — moments on the album.
Following this ﬁrst track is “Jimmy T,”

‘where Axelrod lays a Booker-T style blues-
‘guitar run over’ a background loop that

sounds hauntingly familiar to Everytl1ing’s
“Who Got‘ the Hooch.” The lack of depth to
“Jimmy T” leaves listeners feeling like

they’ve missed something, and gives the

track a ﬂat sound.

What follows on the CD can best be
summed up as seven tracks that all mimic
the ﬁrst in the series. Tracks three through

nine all share the same up—down drum beat ’

and.headache—inducin'g trumpet that holds
one note for entirely too long. Other brass

and suing instruments add to the discord’

along the way, seemingly snuggling for
superiority. ‘ C

One or two sax or guitar solos stand out,
slugging their way out of the musical melee,
but their effectiveness is limited by the
repetitive t111mpet, organ or synthesizer blast
that makes you reach for the bottle. of

Thankfully, Axelrod had the presence
of mind not to attempt to ﬁt many lyrics over
the tracks, as they would probably only con-
fuse and bewilder listeners evenﬁmore.

Included on the CD is aninterview with

Axelrod himself, which you can play on ‘
your computer’s CD-ROM drive. Though it A

may be a cool feature in and of itself, the
rather vague interview is as diffuse and
obscure as the music and doesn’t shed light
on Axelrod’s musical aim or thought
processes. , V A

_ Axelrod would have done better to pick
one genre of music and stick with it, instead

of attempting to pioneer a new musical A

style. If it’s hip-hop you’re looking for, stick
with your traditional hip-‘hop artists. If you
like good jazz, you’re better off tuning in to
The Weathér~.Channel. ‘

RCA Records

"Many comedians, over the course
of their careers, release a live concert
CD. John Leguizamo joins the ranks
of his comic brethren with the
release of Live. '

Live is a recording of

Leguizamo’s act, which is a chrono-

logical retelling of his life, from his
childhood growing up in a multi-
racial home to having children in a
multi—racial relationship. Many peo-
ple who only know Leguizamo as an

-actor who starred in such films as

“Summer of Sam,” “Moulin Rouge”
and “Super Mario Brothers” may be
shocked by his crudeness and’vulgar-
ity. That initial shock will quickly
fade as his act picks up steam -into a
genuine-appreciation of how funny
the-man is. '

However dirty. the act may be, it
fits with his subject matter. When
you talk about growing up with a
younger brother, an important part of
the discussion is the cruel but hilari-
ous jokes you would play on one
another. Hence the track on the disc,
“Fart Asphyxiation.” Unlike most

dirty comedy today, Leguizamo’s
makes sense in the. context of his
material.

The only real problem with the
disc is the two—song “musical inter-

~ mission.” The two songs, “The Night

Before Christmas” and “Gotta Get
Some,” are good enough,’ but they
suffer from what nearly all comedy
discs suffer from: comedians who
think they are singers.

The songs are uninspired, espe-
cially when compared to his comedy.
They don’t further the comedy any
and the songs become a disruption.
At the “intermission,” the comedy
has picked up its pace and you just
want it to keep coming.

Live is a very funny disc but,
ultimately, it cannot escape the fate
that plagues all live comedy discs --
the physical aspect of the act cannot
be captured. The liner notes for the
disc offer many ’ pictures of
Leguizamo physically getting into
his "act. From those, it is clear that
the physical plays an integral part in

_ his comedy.

Despite the lack of seeing his
physicality, Live succeeds in bring-
ing Leguizamo’s act to stereos every-
where. He is a funny and talented
man, especially when his comedy is
compared to his dramatic acting, and
that shines through on the disc.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

  

Broken home and tough

streets couldn’t hold Page down  

NATALIE KRASMAN
Staff Writer

As a child, Julius Page never aspired to
play basketball.

He did not practice for endless hours and
he did not hang out at the courts in Buffalo,
N.Y., to watch how others played the game.

Nor did Page idolize any college or NBA

stars.

In fact, he is not even sure when he
acquired an understanding of the sport, and
explained that playing basketball was an acci-
dent. « '

“I wasn’t [any] good, just athletic, and
eventually I just started to like playing,” Page
said.

He paused for a moment, squinted with a
look of confusion and said, “You know, I just
don’t know when it happened.”

It possibly occurred when‘ Page was 12
years old. Pitt’s 6-foot-3-inch, sophomore
guard’s ﬁrst love was football, but his stepfa-
ther inﬂuenced him to take a new direction.
Page decided to hang up his football spikes to
play basketball for his stepfather, who ran a
summer league for boys between the ages of
13 and 15.

Page was not old enough for the team, but
having the inside family connection paid off,

and he was permitted to play.

Or at least be a member of the team.

“He let me be on the team but I sat the
bench — of course,” Page joked.

When Page reached high school, he met

Fajri Ansari, 'I‘umer-Carroll High School’s A

head basketball coach in Buffalo. Page boast-
ed that he was blessed with talent but he just
didn’t know what to do with it. He credits
Ansari with teaching him fundamentals, like
how to think in the game while utilizing all of
his athletic abilities. .
Despite his natural athleticism, Page
struggled through hardships growing up. His
biological father was absent from his home

life and from the time Page was 5 until he was ‘
-13, and his mother was addicted to drugs,

forcing Page to live with his grandmother in
Buffalo, a city that he dubs, “a ghetto, basical-
ly.”

A ghetto where Page claims he lost at
least ﬁve of his friends every year to violence.
A ghetto Page is grateful he escaped. A ghetto
he never wants to return to.

“It seems like there is nothing you can do
there,” Page said. “I’m just happy ‘I don’t have
to put up with that, and I can just focus on

1 school.”

A strained family life pushed Page to
strive for something better. He knew that

Tangerine Bowl was the
place the Panthers decided to sustain their earlier play.

Pitt’s Al Chesley sits on the bench, disgruntled, after
Pitt’s 30-17 Tangerine Bowl loss to the Wolfpack in 1978.

State Woljpack in the newly resurrected Tangerine
Bowl. These teams have met before in the postseason in
this very same bowl as the Wolﬁack defeated Pitt 30-17.
in the I 978 Tangerine Bowl. Current Steelers head

-coach Bill Cowher started at linebacker for the

Wolﬁyack. The article was printed in the Jan. 8, 1979
issue and was written by Bob Labriola.

“The ﬁrst offensive play was a sack, and it was
downhill after that,” Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill said in
the cramped quarters of the Tangerine Bowl interview
room. It was not simply downhill, it was downhill fast.

The Panthers, in the ﬁne tradition of Franz
Klammer, made it to the bottom of the hill in less than
25 minutes, and North Carolina State, which had post-
ed a 17-0 lead during that time, coasted to a 30-17 vic-

tory.

Theoretically, a bowl game is supposed to be the .

culmination of a team’s season. This year was one of
offensive and defensive shortcomings that Pitt exhibit-

The 31,356 saw offensive play reminiscent of the
Navy game, defensive play not unlike that shown in the
second half at South Bend and a kicking game that pro-
duced no net return yardage and allowed a Joe
Gasparovic punt to be partially blocked.

. Pitt showed the Wolfpack three-wide receiver for-
mation for a portion of the first half, but this confused
no. one wearing red that evening and the Papthers were
limited to 107 total yards in the ﬁrst half. The break-
down (48 yards rushing to 59 passing) proved that while
the offense was impotent, it was, at least, balanced.

“We couldn’t get anything established,” Sherrill
said. “We wanted to do some things early with different
formations and motion, but we couldn’t do it. After we
got behind, we couldn’t get back I the game.

“And then, we had trouble with turnovers,” Shenill
added. \ _

Indoor track gets off to fast start

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

First day jitters? If the freshmen on
the Pitt track team had any last weekend at
the West Virginia Holiday Classic in
Morgantown, W.Va., it didn’t seem to
slow them down.

The freshmen performed like veter-
ans and the veterans were their usual
selves as’Pitt dominatedvthe first meet of
the indoor season.

“We had a really good freshman
tumout,” head coach Steve Lewis said.

Many in the freshman turnout
secured spots at the Big East and the
regional championships at season’s end.

Among that large group was Tamara
McGill, who had a busy schedule at the
meet.

“Tamara probably had the toughest
weekend of her life,” said Lewis of the
freshman, who competed in seven events.

McGill took second in the pentathlon
with 3,392 points, a score that qualiﬁed
her for the Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Conference Championships. McGill also
did particularly well in the high jump,
fourth overall, and the 55—meter hurdles,
where she placed second overall.

The only person ahead of her in the
pentathlon was senior Nicole Kelly, who
Lewis said had one of the more impres-
sive performances he’s seen.

“Nicole’s fourth all-time [at Pitt] right
, now, and the two [ahead of her] were the

' best all-time in the East,” said Lewis of

Kelly, who won the competition with a
score of 3,653.

Freshman Amanda Walker did well
in the shot put, an event in which the
women haven’t had much success in
recent years. Walker took third and quali-
ﬁed for ECAC with a toss of 14.02
meters.

In the men’s event, senior Patrick
Harding won, tossing for a distance of
16.55 meters. He also placed second in the
weight throw.

Freshman Jeryl VV1lbom was placed
in a slower heat of the 500 but still took
third overall and qualiﬁed for the Big East
meet with a time of 1 minute, 5.21 sec-
onds. .

“I got out slow. Thewhole ﬁeld got
out slow,” said Wilbom, who also helped
the mile relay team win. .

Despite getting out slow, Wﬂbom
picked it up, and he credits the cross coun-
try season for giving him that strength.

“Cross country helped a lot,” Curtis
said. “I’ve never been in this good of
shape.”

As for other freshman highlights,
Kim Lyles took second in the 200 and
fourth in the 55 yard dash, qualifying for
the Big East in both. Courage Otaigbe

placed second in the long jump and 

in the 300. Lauren Shaffer placed sixth in
the mile. _ _
For the men, Darrell Curtis placed

5 fourth in the mile and Andrew Zang was

fourth in the 1,000.

, Maybe most impressive of all was the
women’s freshman mile relay team. The
four newcomers took second, beating out
last year’s national champion, Clemson.
Pitt’s “A” team won the event and quali-
ﬁed for ECAC with a time of 3:52.94.

The men’s mile relay won as well and

. will be sending a team to the Inter-

Collegiate Association I of Amateur
Athletes of ‘America, thanks to their time
of 3:20.27. ‘

As for the rest of the veterans, Beth

Rocks won the 1,000 with an ECAC time _

and took fourth in the mile. Amanda
Schmidt won the 3,000. Pitt swept the top
four spots in the _women’s 500 with
Elizabeth Bayne, Janine Jones, Trenace
Elliot and Mera Belisle ﬁnishing first
through fourth, respectively. -

This weekend, Pitt’s will be off to
Newport News, Va., and the Lid Lifter
Invitational at Christopher Newport
University. ’

“Our goal is to have 80 percent of the

team qualiﬁed all the way to the IC and '

EC meets,” Lewis said. “We’ve put a big
dent in [the qualiﬁcations] so far.”

' The Yankees go out and steal other teams’
top players by offering them more money.

An example of that is when they stole
Mike Mussina from my Baltimore Orioles
after the 2000 season.

Mussina wanted a little bit more money
than the Orioles were willing to pay. He didn’t
deserve it. He was coming off of his worst per-
formance as a major league pitcher. He contin-

I’m sick of seeing the Yankees in World Series every
. year. It was a relief to see somebody else win

, tl1eSeries——afreshteamthatthroughhard
work and determination beat a giant.

They relied on clutch hitting and on a nice
one-two punch in Randy Johnson and Curt
Schilling. That is much more refreshing to see,
asopposedtoateamthatis intheWorld Series
ﬁve times out of six years.

' There are plenty of teams that Giambi
would be a nice ﬁt for, such as ﬂre Boston Red
Sox. They already have Manny Ramirez in the
middle of that order, along with Nomar
Garciaparra Giambi could help the Red Sox to
have the best three, four and ﬁve threat in the

swooped him up, and now they are trying to do the same
with Giambi. ‘ ’

The Yankees would be perfectly ﬁne if they were to
keep Trno Martinez. Sure, it would be nice to have a left-
handed power hitter in their lineup who is more than likely
going to hit in between 35 and 50 home runs and drive in 100
runsormoreperseason,butifIhavetowatchtheYankees
dominate the American League one more year, I might boy-
cott the World Series nextyear.

' Theyneedtobreakupthatteam;themajority ofthem
have more World Series rings than most baseball players
ever see in their whole career.

The league would be a lot more exciting if other teams

Major Leagues.

Boston had Jose Olferman playing ﬁrst base last year.
This would have been a huge upgrade at the position. Boston
should have made a huge push to sign Giambi instead of set-
ﬂing on Tony Clark Clark is a reasonable ﬁrst baseman —
he is deﬁnitely a step up from last season, but I feel that
Giambi may have been the missing link

Giambi would give Boston what it needs to compete
with ﬂre Yankees, but he is interested in New York and St.
Louis. He hasn’t expressed any interest in staying in
Oakland. .

Oaklandisayotmg andrisingteamthathadtheYankees

on the ropes in the playoffs. The edition of Jermaine Dye was

a great move. They’ probably were one player away" ﬁom
being a better team than the Yankees. Now Giambihas to
tear down thiseﬂ°ort by going elsewhere. »

He has fallen prey to the Yankees, who offer him a big-
ger paycheck than the A’ s. ' -

I guess there is no loyalty in baseball or sports period, for
that matter. The highest bidder gets the ball player. Most of
these guys are set for life after a couple of years of playing in
the majors. And after players get established they become

, If was more loyalty to teams, the league would be
more competitive. Because of free agency, teams such as the
Yankees can take players from other teams and load up on
talent.

I understand that Giambi wants to win, but he should '

.Want to do it -with a team that is building a legacy. He is the
ﬁnal piece of the puzzle, much like Johnson and Schilling
were for the Diamond Backs. It may take a couple of sea-'
sons, butlthinkitwouldbemorefulﬁllingtowinwithan
up-and-coming team. . _ .

St. Louis ﬁts this mold ’—. with the retirement of Mark

' McGwire, they need somebody who can provideja big bat in
-their lineup. Adding Giambi to the Cardinals would again

make a very dominant middle of the battir_1g_ order, with
Giambi joining Jim Edmonds and Albert Pujols.

I would rather see Giambi go to_ an American League
team, preferably an American League East team The
Yankees must be stopped _ .

A lousy and proveda challenge to the old

saying, “Like father, like son.”

, “It was like a constant competition
between me and him because I think he
feared that one day I might be better than
him, and he couldn’t accept .that fact,”
Page said. “He used to put me down» like,
‘Yeah right, you ain’t never gonna be

, OK to play.”’

Page used the negativities as inspira-
tion at one point, but now approaches the
situation in a new way. The matured
Page dropped the contest because he
said, “You just learn how to move on.”

Since Page’s arrival at Pitt, his father
has only attended one game. But Page
remains nonchalant. ~

“You know the game goes on with
or without him here — so it ‘makes no
difference and it don’t even bother me
any more,” he said.. '

pA_n‘d ‘Page’s performance on the
court demonstrates no signs of a man
who is ; grieving his father’s absence.
Last year, Page made his debut as a
Panther, showing 1 the Big East
Conference his knack for ‘scoring on dri-
ves or from three-‘point range. He also
has the ability to stir up his team and
crowds with his dunking ability and
valiant defensive efforts.

- “He is good at being a pest,” head
Coach Ben Howland said. “He works
hard on the defensive side of the ball,
always guarding the opponent’s best
scorer.”

His freshman highlight reel is
packed with electrifying material, like
scoring a career-high 22 points in the
National Invitation Tournament against
St. Bonaventure, leading the team to a
84-75 victory.

He electriﬁed the Panthers Jan. 20
with A a game-altering dunk over
Georgetown’s 7-foot center Ruben

Boumtje Boumtje to help Pitt to a 70-66

win. The Hoyas were undefeatedjat the
time.

Against Seton Hall‘, Page con-
tributed to the Panthers’ 77-65-upset by
scoring 13 points and hitting a three-
pointer that rallied the team.

He finished last season notching 25
consecutive starts, scoring in double ﬁg-
ures 14 times and proving to be one of
Pitt’s perimeter threats, recording a
team-high 43 shots from behind the arc.

“I can bring excitement,” Page said.
“If our team is losing to someone and
needs a/big play to happen — I can. be
that big play.” ‘

Although Page will be the ﬁrst per- 1

son to brag about his good points, he is
not afraid to comment on his deﬁcien-

cies. He said bal1—hand1ing and unselﬁsh
play are the two aspects he is focusing
on for this season.

During the summer, repetition was
the key to his drills toward improve-
ment. Page practiced hundreds of jump
shots to get his jumper underway, while
also dribbling up and down the court at
full speed to develop his ball manage-
ment.

Page may implement ﬁnger weights
into his dribbling drills to aide him in
ball control. Geared at becoming a more
generous player, Page has been watching
the performance of a close friend as his
model.

“I have been trying to watch Brandin
[Knight] as much as I can because that is
a strong part of his game,” Page said. “I
can score points, but you can’t just
always score points to help your team.”

He added that a player must be a
complete unit on the court —— dominat-
ing in a game only comes when a player
demonstrates a mix of passing, shooting,
rebounding and defensive capabilities.

Page not only provides agitation on
defense and exhilarating offensive tal-
ents, but he also brings style to the court.
It is distinguishable in not only his per-
formance but through his attire as well.

Crowning his head, resting over the
top tips of his cars is the one article of

clothing children anticipate they will
receive after home games —— the “JP1”
headband. Page wears several different
headbands during the regular season, in
white, black or blue, embroidered with
the initials “JP1,” in reference to one of
his many monikers. .

In the preseason Page rests the “JP 1”
headband, replacing it with the tradition-
al Adidas logo because he claims the
“JP1” is for important matchups.

“’JP1’ is something me and my
friends put together. Then I got a ‘JPl’
headband, and it went from there,” Page
explained.

' JP is not his only nickname. He
joked that he is also labeled by his team-
mates as “the coach’s son,” “chip”
because he looks like a chipmunk, and
“Joey.” “Joey,” Page clariﬁed, is the
friend of Dennis the Menace and back-
court teammate Knight hails as “Dennis”
— the other half of the troublesome duo.

Page, although uncertain about
deciding on a major, choosing what
color headband to wear in games and
reaching the NBA, is sure about a few
things.

“I just don’t want to go back home,”
Page said. “And regardless ifI go to the
NBA, I know that my family will be
proud of me because I went to college,
and that is what is most important.”

Trocano and one by Lindsay Delaney)
directly accounted for 10 Wolfpack
points and stopped two Pitt drives head-
ed for apparent paydirt. Trocano also was
sacked five times, and each quarterback
received a sizeable share of physical
punishment from the North Carolina
State defense.

“N.C. State was the problem,” said
Trocano when he was asked to pinpoint
the reason for the defeat. “I got the wind
knocked out of me, I got intercepted and
I got sacked.”

“Put it this way,” the sophomore

THE PITT NEWS

continued, “they were ready for us. They
came ready to play.”

Whether the Panthers had made the
trip to Orlando with the same objective
in mind was the topic of much debate
since jai alai, Mickey Mouse, Shamu,
circus elephants, crippled children and
the Orlando night life crowded football
in the Pitt schedule.

While Shenill allowed, “We didn’t
play as well as we could,” he wouldn’t
blame it on the preparation.

“We went to the same places they
did and practiced the same time,” said
Sherrill. “If I had to do it over again,
we’d prepare the same way, just execute

better.”

Even the ‘defense, which had become
the stalwart of the alumni and fans, exe-
cuted poorly in Orlando. Ted Brown
rushed for 126 of the Wolfpack’s 207
yards on the ground, while an allegedly
weak passing attack burned Pitt on sev-
eral third downs, once producing a 55-
yard touchdown play.

“It was a play-action pass and the
back [Lynn Thomas] just got beat,” said
Sherrill. “They caught us in one—on—one
coverage and the kid [Buster Ray] just
ate us.”

Actually, Ray had little more ‘to do
than to catch John Isley’s pinpoint pass.

1978 Tangerine Bowl was one for Pitt to forget

“Our kids really wanted this one,”
said, Wolfpack coach Bo Rein. ‘They
made great preparation. Never underesti-
mate emotions in a football game. When
you whip a team that soundly, it’s a team
effort.”
