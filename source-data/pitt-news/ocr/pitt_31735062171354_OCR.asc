A gnew’s Visit Spurs

Violence,   A rres ts

by LENN Y KLAVONIC

What began as an orderly dem-
onstration at the downtown Hil-
ton Tuesday evening by members
of the Peace and Freedom Center
and rank-and-file workers. ended

in violence and the arrest of 32

,!

persons.

The protest. which began at 6:30
p.m., was against recent attacks
by Vice-President Spiro Agnew on
labor and youth. Agnew was in
Pittsburgh to deliver a speech at
a $150-a-plate dinner to raise
campaign funds for the Republi-
can Party.

Initially. the demonstration be-

I gan with 50 people. but by 7 p.m.

had grown with the addition of
sympathetic high school and col-

‘lege students. workers and some

‘.5’

members of the over-30 group.

The demonstration was orderly
until a little after 7 p.m., with
various groups chanting slogans
such as “Peace—Now,” “What
Do We Want-Non-Violence,” as
well as sporadic outbursts of pro-
fanity by isolated protestors.

Police were passive until a
group of ten people decided to
burn a flag_near the Liberty Ave.
side of the Hilton. Police proceed-
ed to the site arresting one youth
and a girl who attempted to aid
him. Demonstrators and news-
men rushed to see what was hap-
pening.

The reaction was swift. Assis-
tant Police Superintendent Rob-
ert O'Connell ordered the crowd
dispersed. According to police. a
number of warnings were issued
and when they were not heeded.
O'Connell ordered dogs and police
into action to "move the crowd up
the street."

Many demonstrators claimed
that the warnings were not heard

‘by all and felt that over-reaction

on the part of the police in a sit-

uation that was initially non-vio-
lent precipitated that insuing vio-
lence. Several participants were
clubbed alongside the Hilton Ho-
tel.

Approximately 150 officers.
TPF members. and 12 canine
units participated in the sweep.
driving the people to the corner of
Liberty Ave. and Stanwix St. Dur-
ing this time. several scattered
arrests were made.

Pitt freshman Bob Goodman
was clubbed while walking on Lib-
erty Ave. Goodman claims that
"a TPF stepped on my heel. tell-
ing me to move on. At the same
time he said this to me. he hit me
on the back of my head with his
billy club."

Within a half an hour, people be-
gan regrouping to return to the
Hilton Hotel. At this point, sever-
al police vans arrived at Stanwix
St. where the majority of the peo-
ple were located. Meanwhile,
O’Connel again ordered the police
to sweep the area clean of people.

Armed with clubs. the officers
drove those in front of the hotel
back to Stanwix St. People were
pushed by police units back to
Stanwix St. where a unit of po-
lice was already stationed.

The demonstrators found them-
selves caught between two units
of police. and it was here that
most of the violent incidents oc-
curred. According to Kathy Trist.
a Pitt junior. "They went abso-
lutely crazy. What the cops did
was such an atrocity. If a kid fell.
a bunch of them had to get him.“

One of the incidents cited by
Trist and Goodman was the ar-
rest of four youths, dragged from
an automobile by the police. Po-
lice claim that the car bumped a
TPF van and then attempted to
run down an officer. Goodman,

Huntley and Journalism

US Style

by JUDY VOLLMER

One-half of a nationally famous "gab“ team
proposed that the nation's journalists “are still
convinced that man is a noble being.“ '

Former NBC news correspondent Chet Hunt-
ley addressed an audience of over 1.000 in Law-
rence Hall (Common Facilities Building) Tuesday
night. Huntley's 50-minute talk focused on mass
media and its interpretations of major political
and cultural problems that confront the world.

Huntley introduced his topic of broadcast jour-
nalism by saying that “its challenges and effects
are real. There is no value in discussion of Viet-
nam. the cities, or racial change if we are confused
about the function of the free press."

Huntley emphasized that the free press is the
first institution to be shackled when authoritarian
influence rules. He feels that too many Americans
believe that censorship should be given “a chance.”

On the type of mood aroused when the news is
presented. Huntley commented. "Last spring it
was asserted that we don't print enough “happy
news." If shomehow. enough "happy news" had

 

1970

World’s Best 0

been available. the Huntley Report would have been
“The Happy Hour.“

Commending the American journalistic style,
Huntley explained. “Journalism American style is
still the best in the world. It seeks out the unusual,
the extraordinary.

“After this much injustice, this much cruelty,
bloodshed, and so many wars, we still hold that
these are extraordinary events.

"Journalists were never intended to be cheer-
leaders or leaders of national applause. A good jour-
nalist is a most critical and self-correcting worker.”

Referring to the war in Southeast Asia, Huntley
stated. “A complete understanding of the dilemma
requires a constant study of the war’s background
since World War II. There is a considerable amount
to be said about our motives. We heard a people
crying and we are fighting for their right of self-
determination.“

Huntley warned that as long as their remains a
communist menace. Southeast Asia and Korea are
strategically in danger.

Walgren Attacks "C0p” Excesses 

by TIM SNYDER

"We are close to wide-spread
repression.“ stated Doug Wal-
gren. Democratic candidate for
Congress from the 27th District.
Mr. Walgren spoke at an infor-
mal meeting held Wednesday in
the Pitt Student Union.

Speaking on repression and
other issues of his campaign he
noted that. “When the emotions of
society get high enough. the kinds
of privacy we rely on will go out
the window.“ He referred to Vice-
President Agnew and urged the
replacement of emotional reac-
tions with common sense.

“The people.“ he said. "are un-
der all kinds of pressure includ-
ing economic pressure and unless
we remove this we will have emo-
tionalism. and emotionalism
breeds repression."

A possible step against repres-
sion, he felt, would be a civilian
review board over the police
force. “We must realize that the
police are human beings also and
can make mistakes and therefore
we must demand self-control and
sensible actions from them.”
From reports he received, Wal-

     

gren feels the police have over re-
acted during the demonstration
against the Vice-President on
Tuesday.

When asked how the U.S. should
get out of Vietnam..he answered
simply. “We should just leave."
Walgren claimed that his oppon-
ent. Congressman ‘Fulton. had
been silent on the Vietnam war
until recently when the polls de-
clared that it was safe to oppose
it. “This kind of silence we don‘t
need in an elected office." he de-
clared.

\

"We must ask ourselves wheth-
er the 5000 young Americans who
will lose their lives this year un-
der President Nixon‘s gradual
“Vietnamization” will accom-
plish anything in the long run.. He
feels the answer to this question
is “no“ and therefore urges
prompt withdrawal.

According to Walgren, more al-
ternatives to the draft should be
made available to those who do
not wish to serve in military
forces. “Programs such as
VISTA should be optional to any-
one who wishes to serve their

country without bearing arms,’f

he noted. He also feels that abso-
lutely no draftees should be in
combat without a declaration of
war by Congress, which, he feels,

would prevent another Vietnam. i

When asked why he did not sup-
port an all volunteer army, he
stated that it would undercut the
basic check to military adven-
tures. “A total volunteer army,”
he said, “would exonerate the na-
tion from any military deaths and_

known for his candid analysis and interpretation of the news. On

‘ Mr.

‘3f_“}* .-Tuesday night, Mr. Huntley came to the University and proved to
, it , _—_be~as candid in person as he had been on the air. Never at a loss for
 ;~ words and able to handle all issues deftly, he spoke on a wide range
-.E'*:‘*"‘:~'j‘"f‘_ '-of:.topics, the first of which was ‘electronic journalism’.
'1, "" Huntley stated that advances in technology are opening
:= ' ‘many new fields of journalism, with news now traveling around the
 gfworld in fractions of a second. He also professed fear that this tech-
, l ‘nology may go to waste if Vice President Spiro T. Agnew succeeds
* . ; in having the press muffled.
;‘_   _ Huntley believes, as most people do, except the Vice President.
 ."'that journalism, American style, is the best in the world. Huntley

stated that “Journalists were never intended to be the cheerleaders

 ‘ 2 of the government.” He went on to defend his former profession by
7 saying that “Fortunately, newscasters are not accepted as little
‘, V household gods and what we say is not accepted as the Ten Com-

jrnandments. Some is accepted, some is discarded.” It appears that if
Mr.‘ Agnew wants to accept every word uttered by a newscaster.
’that’s, his problem. Newscasters are doing the best they can and it

is still the best in the world.

On the Viet Nam War, or conflict, Mr. Huntley warned the au-

..‘-ii’,-_;d,ience to “beware of anyone who oversimplifies this war.” He ex-
plained that he was not an early or premature dove and that he be-

 -lieves that the United States motives in South East Asia are not all
f?{_jbad.
 ‘Huntley felt there were two major reasons for U.S. involvement.

Mr. Huntley went on to say that the U.S. must find a way to get

 ~ based in bigotry to one based in equality. He stated that he thinks

The Harrisburg legislator
sympathized with students who
“are concerned about destruc-

His most immediate objective,
he said is ending the war in

would prefer June of next year
as the target date, but I’ll be
satisfied with December 1971 at
the latest.”

Press Conference

Huntley

by POHLA SMITH

Relaxing in a large green
chair in the living room of the

-Intercultural House, Chet Hunt-

ley answered questions on Am-
erican issues and problems in a
fashion reminiscent of the mild
manner by which he informed
millions of Americans of news
and crises during their evening
meals.

Huntley‘s press conference at
the University Tuesday was part
of a speaking tour he is taking
before returing to a ranch in
Montana.

After joking about the advan-
tages of pepole‘s coming to hear
himself instead of Vice Presi-
dent Agnew. who was also in
town Tuesday, ("Its free and
you don't need to bring a dic-
tionary") he spoke out against
Agnew's overheated rhetoric. He
believes there can be no doubt
that Agnew is the President's
spokesman and stressed that his
rhetoric is in no way fulfilling

Nixon‘s inaugural promise to
bring us all together.
The retured commentator

pointed to Agnew’s remarks on

Speaking of disarmament, the
Senator warned that “when peo-
ple live in a day-to-day situation
facing the threat of nuclear
warfare, the limitation of arms
is essential.”

He said he favors “more ef-
fective enforcement agencies.

example of the irrelevancy of
the Vice President’s rhetoric.
“I was nonplussed as to how
the Vice President extracted the
statement that the President is
responsible for campus unrest
. . . It makes me wonder if the
Vice President has read it.”

He later returned to the topic
of Agnew's vote-getting rhetoric
and announced. “Agnew‘s lang-
uage will not bring us together.
It is a’ gut language that ap-
peals to the common denomin-
ator in all of us. There‘s hate
in it.“ Huntley admitted that
he did not know what Agnew
meant by the term “radical lib-
eral" and declared it a cute ploy
to win votes in the November
elections.

Huntley viewed alramingly
the dangers of political com-
mercials. He expressed hope that
Congress would make some
ground rules on the amount of
money a politician would be
permitted. to spend. He mused,
“A person with the right tal-
ents and skills can brainwash
us in thirty seconds. They can
sell a candidate like a can of
beans.”

 

“gel 5/ all /age/ﬁe/z ”

 

torted the former candidate.
“His product is stale, he pro-
tects big business, he hides the
truth, be comes in a package
wrapped by his party, and he is
forced upon us."

“Sesler," Reece continued. "is
the mini-candidate. His approach
is youthful, he stands for the
average man, he is honest with
nothing to hide, he is indepen-
dent of party controls, and his
appeal os natural."

Huntley questioned the value
of political recesses on college
campuses. Despite the brief per-
iod following Kent State and
Jackson State when students
were politically active. “the
American youth has the poor-
est record of registration and
voting. Until that is changed.
"the former newsman explained.
"a political holiday is mean-
ingless.“

'Huntley‘s most eloquent state-

ment of the afternoon was mad€.I_r"~

in answer to a students ques-
tion as to the value of providing
separate states for blacks. Hunt-
1ey’s .voice tingled with emo-
tion as he explained that separ-
atism was not the answer to the
race problem.

“What we need,” he urged,
“is a fundamental change of at-
titudes and heart on the part of
the white majority.” Huntley
elaborated: “The whites have
got to realize that the minorities
are men with pride and sense
just like the rest of us.”

He appeared hopeful as he
pointed out, “The youth of
America seem to have made the
adjustment."

(Continued from Page I)

“The value of total victory has
been blighted." Huntley contin-
ued. “We must turn our full force
of diplomacy. Get out we must."

On the Middle East Crisis,
Huntley remarked, “Our princi-
pal adversary, the Soviet Union,
will negotiate when it is advan-
tageous for them. They are a
ruthless, always neurotic adver-
sary. The whole thing could flip
either way.”

Huntley offered an explanation
for American youth's behavior.
saying that. "We ‘oldsters‘ must
try to understand. not necessarily
sympathize or agree. but under-
stand youth.“

He proposed reasons for youth's
behavior as: a degree of permis-
siveness on the part of parents
who created a child-oriented so-
ciety since World War II; hypo-
crisy in the "older generation."
especially in institutions like the
Senate; and an increasing frus-
tration and a desire to simplify.
sometimes by tearing down. and
sometimes by well—reasoned in-
Volvement.

Huntley concluded his talk with
a chief emphasis on what he con-
siders America’s most serious
and long range problem—the poor
problem, the racial problem, the
inner city, the “White Problem."

Just What Do

/

To Believe In?

’ by DON MARBURY
Editor

I used to think that if the world had just one philosopher-king
governing it, all problems would be eradicated.

Imagine that will you?

I had this idea of some venerable old gentleman. who would take
each problem as it would come up, and quickly come up with a sol-
ution just by looking at it from the standpoint of "right" and

“wrong,” "good" or “bad."

I USED TO believe that there were basic truths in the world-
that every man when exposed to {these truths then became a ration-

 

. al being.

I actually used to tell people that once a person became know-
ledgeable of these somewhat ethere‘al concepts. he was on his way to

. becoming a human being; the only other step being the application

and experience of them.
But I was wrong. Man. I was badly mistaken.

I USED TO believe that to kill another human being was wrong.
It didn’t even occur to me. that you could say something like. “Kill-
ing is wrong, except“ or “Killing is wrong. and you only do it when. "

And then other little qualifications rg these truths start popping
up. “Oppression of anyone else is bad." I used to believe that to. But

' oppression is bad only if you

can’t rationalize it, and make
some excuse which will over-
shadow the quilt one must feel
in performing the act.

I used to believe the expres-
sion, “Do your own thing and
don’t keep anyone else from do-

The battles he must have

puffs of inconsequence.

I can't stretch my imagination

vocabulary. He was also illiter-
ate in his native tongue too. so it
was difficult even in the immi-
grant ghetto of New York.

1 SUPPOSE he was the essen- '

tial embodiment of rugged in-
dividualism. Faced with su-
premely powerful forces. he roll-
ed up his sleeves and survived—-
and not everyone survived.

_My world includes no taste of
crushing poverty. or even the
threat of it. My material life is
a dream world compared to the
best in my grandfathers time.
The challenges for me. and the
challenges are vast and threat-

 

ening. have none of that tangibil-
ity which forced my grandfather
into a race with survival.

Right now my sleeves are not
rolled up. I don‘t feel the cocki-
ness he must have felt. I cannot
stare my problems in the face as
he must have when he stepped
off the ship in Manhattan.

my grandfather met the enemy
—poverty—with such ideals. and
did finally. beat it down.

IT IS no longer the heartless

cynic who sees ideals in terms,

of illusions and disappoint-
ments. Bombarded by informa-
tion from around the globe it is
possible today to be aware of
hundreds of simultaneous catas-
trophes and to identify strongly
with them through television.
Given the leisure time of the stu-
dent. and the pounding attack on

our myths by bad news. it is in-_

creasingly difficult to not adopt
an attitude of cynicism.
Dissillusionment is the key-
note of the time from the top of
society to the bottom. and the
root of it is found in a combina-
tion of awareness and time to

that they could come from sub-
marines and end the earth vir-
tually in minutes. “My God!
Thats terrible!" she said. and
she was depressed and dis-
traught for days afterwards. I
genuinely envied her once-care-

free ignorance. and I hated my-
self for bringing her such ugly
news.

THE question: did my grand-
father think about the terrible
events of his day; the Indians
being massacred. corporations
attacking the countryside? Prob-
ably not. He was too busy trying
to get enough to eat. He had wor-
ries enough without a bunch of
Indians‘ problems cluttering his
mind. And. of course. electronic
broadcasting was not around to
expand his world.

It would be unfair for me to
see my granddad as a narrow
man. Cynicism is its own de-
fense to keep from suffering.

A friend of mine called me
not long ago. "Somebodys got
to help me. I‘m not in control of
my life!" he shouted frantically.
"The draft is gonna get me and I
don‘t want to be killed. They
want to kill me and I can't do
anything about it. I‘m so help-
less! What am I gonna do?
What?"

HE CAUGHT me in a not—too-
generous mood. I said. "Try not
to think about it." That was the
wrong thing to say; he almost
blew out of his skin.

But to blot out all the misery.
to work at forgetting what you
know is bad around you. that is
a full-time. debilitating job. It
takes great innovativeness to es-
cape what is all around you.
Kitchen table conversation of
revolution. casual comments
about the death of the planet

SEE HOW THE world has blown up? It is wrong to steal but if
greedy persons had not taken more than their share in the first
place. Or had they not rationalized what they knew was right. and
exploited people. making their very survival dependent on stealing.
it still would be totally wrong.

The point is. that the generations before us have made every-
thing so damn qualitative. that we can't come up with any real an-
swers anymore. Nothing is right or wrong. but semi-right or semi-
wrong. or sort of false or quasi-true. or half real or pretty humane.

And you sometimes wonder if those who feel we should just de-

Those “Ivory Tower” Notions’

by MARK COHEN
Staff Columnist

Recently the YAF started a national campaign
for peace on campus. Those students who desire
peace and non-violence are offered a blue button to
place on their clothing.

What kind of peace is the YAF offering‘?

, Stating that they abhor acts of violence. YAF
supports the Amerikan genocide in Southeast
Asia. Stating that the university must remain a
center of intellectual argument and inquiry. they
say the university is above the practice of the gov-
ernment and society in which it exists and serves.

TO SAY that the university is an apolitical in-
stitution is nonsense. The existence of ROTC. de-
fense research and the corporate control of uni-
versities. demonstrates the absurdity of the YAF
notion of the "ivory tower."

The YAF does desire quiet on campus. how-_

ever. For the university community has been a
major area of resistance of government policy in

Southeast Asia. Students have paid with their lives
at Kent State. Jackson State. Orangeburg. Berke-
ley and Kansas State for resistance to the govern-
ments‘ mass violence.

The YAF tells us that this is what happens
when people’ actively oppose government policy in
a “free society."

THE YAF wants domestic passivity and for-
eign plunder. "Peace on campus" in YAF terms
is not just opposition to violent protest but opposi-
tion to all protest. During the Grape Boycott the
YAF disseminated nationwide propaganda oppos-
ing the organizing attempts of Cesar Chavez and
the United Farm Workers of America. Chavez and .-
the Farm Workers Union are committed to non-
violence but this did not keep the YAF from sup-
porting the wealthy California landowners.

The YAF does not want peace but rather pas-
sivity. They want us to be "good Germans" while
our government commits abominable war crimes
abroad and intensifies domestic repression.

On Tuesday night. a tragic event occurred. Our
illustrious Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew came to
the city of Pittsburgh.

Being a symbol of the administration and the
administrations policies he brought many pro-
testors to the site of the Hilton Hotel where he was
speaking. These protestors demonstrated in a
peaceful manner by picketing around the building.

During this time an American flag. a symbol
of liberty. went up in flames. The next moment
two young adults were dragged off into the police
van. The picket line stopped. and as I heard from a
newsman later. we were told to leave the site. but
oh thing 

 

     
   
 

THE TACTICAL Police Force then appeared
in full riot gear with dogs. They moved forward
and people panicked and started to run. An obscen-
ity never hurt anyone. but the police did not feel
this way. They felt that this was the provocation
for beating kids heads. Some were bitten byithe
dogs. One girl near me fell down and a dog ripped a
chunk of flesh out of her leg.

Who was the aggressor? Anyone who saw what
happened knows full well that it was the police. ltm}
was a police riot. The same kind that happened in
Chicago in "68.“ at Berkeley's Peoples Park. and
at the court room trial in Pittsburgh last spring.

Now Pittsburgh goes on the list of police riots

An America
Spelled With ‘C’

Editor. The Pitt News:

It is obvious why Mark Cohen
has no intention of disputing the
conservative elements at Pitt. He
can neither establish a tenable po-
litical position nor defend the one
he takes. Marxism. as Marx de-
vised it. does not exist in the world
today. Does Mr. Cohen advocate
Soviet or Red Chinese Marxism as
a suitable alternative to demo-
cracy‘?

The American worker is far bet-
ter off. economically and socially.
than his counterpart anywhere in
the world. especially in the-Social-
ist countries. Strikes and protests
underscore freedom to express
dissatisfaction and to seek im-
provements. hallmarks of demo-
cracy.

Maybe Mr. Cohen can tell us
what might happen to Russians
who protest or strike‘? Observe
that Mr. Cohen can preach Marx-
ism in America. but Professor
Koehler was expelled from Russia
last summer because she spoke in
defense of America. It is far bet-
ter for Americans to correct
Americas faults than to revolt in
favor of a system which offers far
less than ours.

Since he deplores economic
strangleholds. Mr. Cohen will be
happy to know that Yugoslavia
(and to some extent Rumanial has
broken the Soviet grip over it. The
people of Yugoslavia are beginning
to experience a vibrant economy
and a marked improvement in
their standard of living due to cap-
italistic means. And just why did
the Soviet Union invade Czecho-
slavakia‘?

I do not believe that Marxism is
stupid. I do believe. however. that
it is very unrealistic. from Marx‘s
theory of simultaneous world rev-

olution to the maxim: "From
each according to his ability. to
each according to his needs! "

Marx's utopian concepts reach
far beyond those of Thomas
More's. Yet I find More's human-
istic approach to society sadly
lacking in Marx. We could all do
with a little less egotism and a lit-
tle more community spirit. but I
submit that any ideology which de-
nies the innate worth of the indi-
vidual cannot prove benevolent to
the masses.

In conclusion I offer Mr. Cohen
two suggestions: 1) establish uto-
pian Marxism as a viable way of
life before offering it as an alterna-
tive to democracy. 2» spell
America with a c not a k.

Marxists Try
To Re-Enslave

Editor. The Pitt News:

This is in response to Mr. Coh-
en's article. I am a brother. a black
man. a descendent of slaves.
Black people have fought for over
300 years to emmancipate them-
selves from slavery. The struggle
for freedom still continues.

However. the Marxists have en-
deavored to conspire to cast black
people back into slavery. only this
time under the name of socialism.

ism. or whatever you decide to call
it. In plantation slavery or Marxist
slavery. we work for the master.
The only difference is that in plan-
tation slavery. the master is a
white racist farmer and in Marx-
ist slavery the master is the state
that we must obey or else.

If socialism is so great then why

Marxists not only have a New Left
and a New Working Class. but they
also have a New Racism. Any
black man who supports socialism
is contributing to his own death.
We black capitalists are the field

is on fire. we hope that it burns
down. When the master is sick. we
hope that he dies.

I will fight to the death to avoid
being re-enslaved. I am not going

 —- I am basically satisfied with the direction in which the Pitt

‘.~\th_letic,Department is headed. the main reason I haven't been
_: very ivocal lately. Besides. I enjoy reading about other peoples
- y‘iew's—-people who really know about their sport. like players
»and coaches.

, But there are two matters that acquire some attention at
. the moment.

 First. Athletic Director Casimar Myslinski probably knows
 more about stadium seating than I do. but it is apparent that
.'many"students are unhappy with the arrangements provided for
them at Pitt Stadium for football games. Students simply don‘t
enjoysitting in end zone seats when better views are possible
f .when there is a low non—student turnout. The students enter end
 szoneiseating when the alloted sections. which were increased
_;..from four to six this year. begin to overflow. ’

 ~ A suggestion was made that students be permitted to oc-
f_:-scupy the better seats which are vacant at halftime.

 ,“We receive calls and letters from people who pay for
»_ tickets about the behavior of students in sections next to them."
i'-._\'lyslinski argues. "What would happen is we-mistakenly allow
;a.,,drunken student to sit next to someone who has paid six dol-
lars for his seat.“ ’ ’

’:'.fGranted. the suggestion is not the greatest of ideas. But
I perhaps giving the students better sections in the first place is
f the answer.

'  The_ Pitt students deserve consideration. According to
;'spo’r'ts publicist Dean Billick, 11,500 students attended the Pitt-
°‘UCLAlgame three weeks ago. The undergraduate enrollment at
 ‘_Pitt.-is,‘ 14,236.

"  The other problem concerns some student athletes.

  .. How would you like to get out of bed a 7 a.m. on a Saturday

 7That’s about what Pitt soccer players must do when they
 play.-at home on the week-end of a home football game. The team
plays. the early morning games on the Stadium’s AstroTurf,
 , which is great—but why so early?

., ,,.;[The original reason given for the early scheduling was the

PITT INJURY CHART

Carrying a squad riddled by
injuries, Coach Carl DePasqua
leaves for Annapolis, Md., to-
day.

Slighted to miss the trip will
be quarterback Dave Havern,
defensive end Hank Alford and
defensive end Jack Dykes.

Dykes, who is now in West
Penn Hospital, injured his right
knee in the Kent State game.
There is no bone damage but
he is out indefinitely. Alford in-
jured his right knee against
Baylor and will probably be
back after the Navy game.

Havern has not responded
sufficiently to treatment for his
back injury which he suffered
in the second quarter of the
Pitt-KSU game. Ralph Cind-
rich, Charlie Hall, and John
Hogan are okay for the contest.

i _Middies °Sky-High’ For Ailing Cats

Cindrich and Hogan
Set For Naval Battle

by JERRY MYERS

In his second year as coach of the United States Naval Academy.
Rick ‘Forzano is setting his sights more on “respectibility” rather than
on out and out victory when his Navy Middies take on the Pitt Panthers

tomorrow at Annapolis.

Faced with a mammoth rebuilding job. Forzano is aware of the diffi-
culties inherent in moulding a top football team. Stocking his team a
large number of sophomores. Forzano has been plagued with "sopho-
more mistakes" all through the first four games of the 1970 season.

He is also aware of the Pitt Panthers. “The Panthers are a fine
football team." Forzano said. “Carl‘s (DePasqua) done a fantastic job

with the team. They’re sound and
they run a pro-offense and a pro-
defense.“

Forzano then added, “I wish
they weren’t as improved as they
are.”

According to Pitt's assistant
coach. Bill Quinter. Navy won‘t be
the soft-touch they seem. “This is
a young team that has an awful lot
of good looking sophomores,“ he
began. “They make a lot of mis-
takes but one of these days they‘re
going to overcome their sopho-
more mistakesand win some foot-
ball games. "

Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua ech-
oes Quinter's concern. “Navy is
aggressive.“ DePasqua said.
"They're a typical Navy football
team. They're out to win and so
are we."

The Middies, who have gone
with their sophomore quarter-bac-
terback Ade Dillon for most of the
early games will have to turn to
senior signal-caller Mike McNal-
len. McNalleu had trouble moving
the ball against Boston College,
but Dillon hurt his leg in last
week’s game against Washington,
so Forzano will have to use Mc-
Nallen, a gridder who riddled the
Pitt secondary for 254 yards in
23 completions last year.

The Panthers will be entering
tomorrow’s contest slightly un-
dermanned. The quarterback
problem has been solved. “Dave
Havern doesn't look like he‘ll
make the trip.“ was the way
Coach DePasqua put it. He then
announced that both John Hogan
and Tom Hasbach will be ready
for action.

Ralph Cindrich has also indi-
cated that he is ready to play.
He’ll only see limited action.
though. “It would be bad to turn
me loose against West Virginia."
Cindrich said, “without any play-
ing time in the Navy game."

When asked whether he’s hav-
ing any trouble with his leg, he‘
mentioned that he couldn't turn.
“I’m gonna try to go through the
season with it and then I’ll get it
cut,” referring to a post-season
operation that will be necessary.

Forzano appears to have a
brighter attitude toward the fu-
ture now that he has developed a
strong sophomore team. “Last
year we were all seniors." For-
zano said. “This year we're a
sophomore team. There‘s a silver
lining now. Next year we'll be bet-
ter and in two years we'll be a
good football team."

Navy‘s Homecoming is this
week-end and the middies "are
sure to be sky-high as a result of
it." according to Quinter. But For-
zano is worried about being "out-
physicalled" by the Panthers, and
he is primarily concerned with his
"promising" sophomores.

“They‘ve been promising a lot,"
he concluded.

Harriers Compete In

ND Invitational Today  

by MARTY HELLMAN

V The first big test of the season for the cross country team comes
this afternoon at the Notre Dame Invitational meet. -

Over 20 of the best midwestern schools are entered in this year‘s
edition of the annual fall race at South Bend. Ind. ‘ ’

Last year the Pitt harriers placed third overall in the race. with
Jerry Richey taking individual honors for the squad by finishing fourth

out of over 200 runners.

At the time, Jerry was recuper-
ating from an operation and was
not up to full strength yet. Two of
the runners who beat him at Notre
Dame last year were Jerry Lieb-
enberg from Western Michigan
and Sid Sink from Bowling Green.

Both Liebenberg and Sink will
be competing again today. and
Richey regards them as stiff op-
position.

"I’ve beaten them off-and-on in-
termittenly through the years. but
I know that they both ran all sum-
mer." he said. "They‘re both very
good.“

Coach Jim Banner is‘ unsure of

the caliber of the“teamsin the .
meet this-year’,but- realizes that ’
'many;,;.of, thesguads may have-"a bit

“Most of the midwestern
schools start having their dual
meets earlier than we do.“ he
commented. “and therefore have
had more competition so far this
yearf‘

The course at Notre Dame dif-
fers from the course at Schenley
Park where the harriers train.

It is a five mile course as op-
posed to the four mile local one,
and whereas the Park path con-
tains many hills, Notre Dame’s is
mostly level.

“The guys like to go there for
that reason.“ Banner explained.
"At this time of the year. it can

“They’ll be able to see their I

competition all the way around
the race,” Banner continued.
“The boys will be able to see all of
the runners ahead of them.”

This will be the first big- race
for senior Mike Schurke as a
member of the Pitt squad. Last
week against Cleveland State. he
was part of the six-way tie for top
spot. in his first race here after
transferring from Penn State.

Coach Banner expects that
most of the team will finish the
race under 25 minutes. He
bases this prediction on the times
run against CSU last week.

In the final practice session be-
fore today’s meet, Banner gave
the team one of the highest com-
pliments a coach can bestow on
his team.

Booters Face  

Robust Temple

by MIKE MILLER

The soccer team will go up against an improved and rejuvinated
Temple squad tomorrow at Temple in the booters fifth match of the

season.

Coach Leo Bemis feels that Temple will exhibit a new style of play

this season.

According to the coach. the eastern part of the state is a “hot bed
of soccer." All of the high schools and junior high schools have fine soc-

blasting the Rockets’
winning streak.

Slippery Rock, Pitt's strongest
rival, bowed after a three hour
marathon match .

“It was a worthwhile win——the
most worthwhile win of the sea-
son." stated Dr. “Goldie" Ed-
wards. Pitt‘s coach. “They were
the toughest team we‘ve encoun-
tered. I’m delighted for the team.
Its a feather in their cap."

Eileen Surdoval dropped the
number one singles match to
Barb Drake, a veteran tourna-
ment player, 2-6, 7-9.

Barb, who was ranked fourth
in Western Pennsylvania last
year and 18th in among state J.
C. players, hit the ball unusually
hard. Once Eileen adjusted to
this. she set up her plays more.

Eileen commented, “I tried to
hit to her back hand a lot but

cer programs. There are also a
number of teams associated with
Boys Clubs and other organiza-
tion. L

Temple has recruited a number
of players from these teams who,
in addition to their soccer exper-
ience, have played together on
soccer teams.

Many of these freshmen and
sophomores have replaced return-
ing lettermen in the starting line-
up. In their first match only three
of the 15 returning lettermen
started.

Bemis feels that these younger
players will employ a more ag-
gressive style of play.

A scouting report from Rider
College, Temple’s last opponent,
revealed that in addition to
strength and aggressiveness the
squad has developed a fine mid-
field play.

They have two fine interior for-
wards through whom they work
long passes. One of these for-
wards is‘ an experienced senior.
while the other—a freshman—was
one of the best high school for-
wards in the Philadelphia area.

Bemis expects Temple to be
stronger physically, especially
with the half backs.

The booters are still hobbled by
injuries. Gary Midock, a full back,
aggravated an already injured
knee and his appearance is doubt-
ful.

Conference “Tsima“ will miss
at least another week due to a
knee injury sustained at the West
Chester match. The trainers re-
port that Tsima is responding well
to treatment despite the serious-
ness of the injury.

John White, who sustained an
ankle injury. is also a doubtful
starter. White is able to run in a
straight line but has difficulty
when he has to cut.

Temple lost its last match to
Rider, 4-2, but defeated Penn by
a score of 1-0.

The Pitt booters have maintain-
ed a 2-2 record for the season.

1 Girls Hockey Squad 
Evens Tally At 1-1-1 

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Pitt‘s Women‘s Varsity Field

Hockey Team defeated C-MU
Tuesday 2-0 and boosted their
season record to 1-1-1.

Pitt dominated the entire
game. Early in the first half.
though. Pitt had some problems
rushing. but with a minute and a
half left in the half center for-
ward, Lynn Collman. drove
straight down the firld to‘ score
Pitt's first goal of the game. also
the first of the season. C-MU
made two consecutive scoring
threats in the first few minutes.
but Pitt successfully fought off
both attacks.

Pitt came back with a quick
point in the second half. With
one minute gone. Lynn again
scored a goal for Pitt. Shortly
after obtaining the second goal.
Pitt scored a goal which was
later taken away as a penalty
was called on the play. and the
officials whistle had blown be-
fore the ball was shot into the
goal zone. C-MU attempted a
comeback in the middle of the

second half. but to no avail. Two
expert saves by goalie, Katie
Whiteman. cooled C-MU‘s at-
tack.

Coach De Burnstine was ob-
viously satisfied with the teams
performance. “We really played
well. Everythings finally start-
ing to click.“ The coach was
particularly pleased with the
performances of goalie Katie
Whiteman and center forward
Lynn Collman. "Katie really
made some tremendous saves
out there today and Lynn was
a real boost to our inexperienc-
ed forward line." Coach Burn-
stine said.

Asked what she felt was the
major reason for the win, the
Coach replied. “The defense
played well. as usual, but the of-
fense was greatly improved to-
day. Lynn Collman sparked drive
into the forward line. The two
wings were moving the ball
downfield, and the inners rushed
well.“

by MARK SIGMON

In a starling upset on Wednes-
day, Mad House nipped Delta Tau

mitory softball championship

game. Despite committing five

errors, Mad House handed Doug
Kennedy his first defeat of the
season. with a three-run assault
in the bottom of the fifth inning.

Mad House opened the scoring
with a run in the bottom of the

Midnite Hour

third inning. when catcher Tom
Williams punched a two-out. run-
scoring single to right. However.
the Delta came back to tally four
runs in the fourth. with the help of
three Mad House errors.

Jerry Nowak delivered a game-
tying double as Kennedy scored
from first base. Nowak then tal-
lied on Bob Loughery's single. Bob
Madtes‘ single drove in Loughery.
and Bob Lepore crossed the plate
on an error.

Mad House sliced the deficit to
4-2 in the bottom of the fourth

. inning when Jack Tighe’s base hit

Of 'Mad’ Men

“It's been a long time since a
dorm team has won the all—cam-
pus softball championship. and
were going to do it."

That‘s what Mark Anatole said
after Mad Houses impressive 9-2
victory over the House of the Mid-
night Hour for the Dorm League
championship on Tuesday. (Wed-
nesday. Mad defeated Delta Tau
Delta in an All-Campus playoff
game.)

Mad House jumped on losing
pitcher Walt Drawl for a run in
the first inning. four in the third.
and then scored three in the fifth
in the dorm title game. before the
inexperienced freshman house of
the Midnight Hour rallied for two
runs in their half of the fifth.

Singles by Jerome Pigza. Keith
Stuart and Jack Tighe gave Mad

their final run.
