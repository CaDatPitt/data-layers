Dorms
have new
sign—in
policy  

By Marc Duchin
Assistant News Editor

A new rule was established this
term for students living in Pitt
dorms in order to crack down on
violators of the guest policy.

Brackenridge, McCormick,
Holland North, Forbes, Bruce
and Amos Halls are using a new
guest policy designed to prevent
students from signing in bogus
names, according to Dave Taylor,
a desk clerk at McCormick Hall.

Taylor said the new policy re-
quires desk clerks to sign in stu-
dent residents and their guests
rather than students signing in
themselves. _

”The students don't like it;
that's the general opinion,” said
Taylor. ”|t’s difficult for us be-
cause we have to keep an eye on

E ' the door, and that's difficult when
_ you're writing in someone else’s

name-. People can slip in when
you're looking down at the
[guest] sheet.”

According to Taylor, the new
policy was created in response to
students signing in false names
and room numbers. ”When' we
would call to verify that a student
had a guest, they could just deny
it,” said Taylor. ,

’’I think it's ridiculous,” said
Luisa Posa, a resident at McCor-
mick Hall. ’’It [the policy] treats
us like children.”

’’I haven't really noticed a
difference,” said Mark Carroll, a
resident at McCormick Hall. ’’I
never really thought about it.”

’’I haven't seen a real problem
with it,” said Debbie Lucas, a
resident at Holland Hall. ’’It
doesn't really matter if the desk
clerk signs my name two seconds
slower than I do.”

”When you have a group of
people and I have to sign every-
one in, it can slow down things
a lot,” said Garry Lash, a desk
clerk at Holland Hall.

Francie Kern, a desk clerk at
Brackenridge Hall generally
agreed with the new policy.
”This policy probably keeps the
rules better,” she said. ”You’re
really going to be able to get
around any system.”

Kern said she was under the
impression that all Pitt dormito-.
ries switched to the new system.

Howard Webb, a desk clerk at
Tower C, said that he wasn't told
to use the new system and that he
allows the students to sign in their
own guests. ”This is my first year

The identities of those released

100th Labor Day parade.

From the pulpit at the Roman’
Catholic Church, the Baptist
minister led pre—parade worship-
pers, including many laid-off steel
workers, through a 10-point
”Workers’ Bill of Rights.”

Jackson said workers have
rights to a job, union representa-
tion, a living wage, a safe work
place and pension security. He
played to the local audience, say-
ing American steel workers
should not lose their jobs to for-
eign ”slave labor.”

”Let us fight together and not
one another,” he said.

TheJackson camp, with an offi-
cial, presidential exploratory
committee in place since March,
has placed new emphasis on or-
ganization, in contrast to the

I 1984 campaign that was notori-

ous for its chaotic pace and

minute-to-minute schedule‘
changes.
_ Jackson officials have a goal of

raising $5 millionby March. So
far, campaign staffers said, the
Jackson forces have brought in
around $1 million.

.‘ Can you imagine peace?

l3 The Program on’ International Peace and Security (IPS) at Carnegie Mellon
" Unviersity is running a competition to encourage individuals and small groups
(up to four) to develop realistic scenarios for peace (no big wars, near wars,
miracles or aliens.) Scenarios may, for example, describe how the U.S.A. and
the U.S.S.R. resolve the cold war, or how peace is achieved in a significant
regional conflict.

Your idea for a peaceful future could win you the chance to participate in a
unique academic experience. During the spring and summer semesters of 1988,
selected students will join ’’Imagine Peace” fellowship winners in a series of
workshops and seminars aimed at developing scenario proposals into
publishable products. Students will earn 3 or 4 credits while completing a
scenario in a form suitable for media use.

To become eligible, students should submit inital proposals by October 16th.
These should be 1500 words or less and should describe the scenario in detail
as well as plans for its development. Further information and applications are

/ackson: ’Back to work’

By Eric Poole
Staff Writer

Although it has been assumed
for months thatlesse Jackson will
run for the Democratic nomina-
tion for president, there was still
the matter of the time and place
for the official ”unofficia|” start-
up of the Jackson campaign.

The time was Labor Day, and
the place was Pittsburgh.

After disclosing his plans on
Good Morning America to offi-
cially declare his candidacy on
Oct. 10, Jackson attended mass
and gave a sermon at St. Benedict
the Moor church, then he went
to the Labor Day parade.

 

ANALYSIS,

The": theme for yesterday's
Labor Day parade was, ”Let’s Get
America Back To Work.” This
slogan is most likely one of the
reasons Jackson chose Pittsburgh
to kick off his campaign.

The sluggish, if not non-
existent, recovery of the Mon Val-
ley from the demise of the steel
industry stands as a symbol that
all is not well in Ronald Reagan's
America.

As a prospective presidential
candidate, Jackson promises to

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT -

be pro labor. Pittsburgh, along
with Chicago, is the birthplace of
the labor movement.

The link between Jackson and
labor could very well deliver the
Rust-Belt states into the Jackson
fold. ~

In 1984, Jackson had some
problems in the Northeast, fol-
lowing the well-publicized

9 ”Hymietown” faux pas.

The second reason Jackson
probably chose Pittsburgh for the

starting point for a presidential '

campaign that will last 13 months
is the politically aware black
population in Pittsburgh. »

Like it or not, Jackson is not
only a presidential candidate, but
a black presidential candidate,
and he will have to deliver the
black vote in force to win the
Democratic nomination for
president.

Jackson will also have to draw
the labor vote, which would not
be a surprise, as Jackson is, so far,
the only candidate to link his
campaign to the labor
movement. ’

Iflackson can bring these two
groups into the Rainbow Coali-
tion, he could wake up on New
Year's Day 1988 as not only the
most fiery speaker in the cam-
paign, but also as the front-

runner.

R Echo resounds; New Order stays silent

Echo and The Bunnymen, New
Order, Gene Loves Jezebel

‘ Civic Arena

Sept. 5

‘ By Michele Ki_raly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

It's odd that a teenie—bopper, pop movie
like Pretty In Pink would have a decent
soundtrack, boasting the names
Psychedelic Furs, Suzanne Vega, New
Order, Echo and The -Bunnymen and The
Rave Ups (even th'ough their ”Positively
Lost Me” was aired in the movie but
didn't make the soundtrack).

What's even more bizarre is the thought
that all of the above musicians passed
through the city sometime or another dur-
ing the two monthssince Vega was the
first of the pack to come in July.

To end the trend, Echo and the Bunny-
men and New Order teamed with Gene
Loves Jezebel, stopped in Pittsburgh this
past Saturday as part of their 22—city
’American tour.

Caine, Michael Caine, plays spy  

Gene Loves Jezebel opened the night
clad in their flowing outfits, dancing to

blinking lights in a closed-lid Civic Are-.

na. If it wasn't raining, the rumor was the
arena’s ceiling would have been opened
to enable a concert under the stars. Since
it was raining, the top was tight, but that
didn't matter. Who wou|d.want to look
up at the stars when they were right‘ on
the arena floor in a center-setlstage.

This band played favourites (note the
British spelling) like ”Desire” and ”Heart-
ache;” They also performed their newest
single, ”Motion of Love.” Gene et al. are
good performers; they danced around the
stage and kept the audience on their feet.

Next up was Echo. Their set opened
with some eerie—sounding, pipe-organ
church music and smoke from dry ice.
Lead singer Ian McCu|loch also played
guitar and rambled through such Bunny-
men classics as ”The Cutter” and ”Kil|-
ing Time.” An avid Doors fan, McCu|loch
did his version of ”Light My Fire.” The
band also does ”People Are Strange,”

New Order gave a concert that sounded like the studio recordings, even though they decided to give Pittsburgh the silent treatment between each song. .

which is included in the Lost Boys movie
soundtrack but wasn't on Saturday's
playlist.

The group bid welcome to all Pitts-

burghers and affectionately performed ’’I-
Can't Help Falling in ‘Love With You,” of .

Frank Sinatra fame. Yes, this band is
diverse. The name Echo came from the
nickname of.a drum machine that the
band used in the late—1970s.

Since then, drummer Pete de Freitas has
joined. The group recently released a self-
titled album and played some tracks like
the vibrant ”New Direction” and the
sultry ”Lips Like Sugar.”_

I expected Echo to play last since it was

the firstband listed for the concert,

However, the last shall be first (as was
Gene Loves Jezebel), and the first wasn't
last. New Order prowled‘ onto stage un-
der some really neat purple and green
lighting. ’

New Order began with ”Bizarre Love
Triangle” and followed with a new
release, ”True Faith.” Both tunes are syn-

   

By William Young
Staff Writer

When theopening credits have
finished rolling for The Fourth
Protocol, we are nicely present-
ed with a few sentences to read
about some secret nuclear ac-
cords signed in the late '60s by
the then nuclear powers. Then
we are told that these accords
contained four secret protocols

-and that only one remains.

That last protocol must state
that Russian spies don't get any
lines. '

Pierce Brosnan plays Major
Petrovsky, a top Soviet spy sent
to Britain to build a nuclear bomb
near an American air base. He's
to explode it in the hopes that
Western Europe will tell the Unit-
ed States to remove its nuclear
missiles.

The plot here closely resembles
that of Octopussy, in which a cra-
zy Russian general plans to ex-
plode a nuclear bomb in
Germany and only James Bond
can stop it. Funny, there's a cra-
zy Russian general in here, too.

Although thislis a spy film, it
isn't full of car chases and
elaborate fight scenes. Protocol is
a film with intrigue, not action

‘and acting, not combat.

Brosnan, however, isn’t'Bond
-— Michael Caine is, sort of. Caine
gets to do all the talking and, ap-
parently, all the thinking, as he
stumbles across a component of
a nuclear bomb after being
demoted by his boss to the Air-
ports and Ports division of the
British secret service.

Brosnan plays his character
flawlessly, proving that even
though he's not James Bond, he

can play a spy as well as any-
body. Caine is excellent as well.
He manages to bring a human
side to his character, while Bros-
nan (because of the script) is
merely an automaton carrying
out orders — without emotion,
without words.

Caine aptly displays his frustra-
tion with his superiors as well as
his love for his son.

The only really disappointing
part of this movie (and it's an ex-
cellent movie) is that the au-
dience is kept in the dark until the
very end. The trick ending,
despite the fact that it works
reasonably well, makes the entire
plot seem like a moot point, and
it appears as if the West and the
East really aren't enemies but
friends trying to outdo each other
in the Cold War game.

thetically endowed but also feature gui-
tar and Bernard Sumner’s vocals.

This band plays very good dance mus-
ic, but they aren't very personable. They
didn't introduce themselves or their mu-
sic. They came onto stage, did their thing
and left. This might piss off some of the
crowd but considering that New Order
rose out of the ashes of the angry and then

, younger members of Joy Division. We

were lucky to see their faces.

The band isn't without flair, though.
They did their idea of ”Take a Walk on
the Wild Side.” They also performed their
1983 dance hit ’’Blue Monday” and

played an extended version of ”Perfect

Kiss.” They left out the Pretty in Pink track
”Shell Shock,” as Echo and the guys left
out ”Bring On The Dancing Horses.”
New Order kept the crowd hopping ’til
nearly 11 p.m. if you were lucky or
danced crazily enough, you might have
been captured on film by a cameraman
roaming the concert. We'll have to wait

. for some new band videos to see if Pitts-
burgh fans made the concert reels.

weeks, that's 42 classes per term.
Now, every time the class meets,
I'm paying approximately $8.00.
I just went to my first class of the
term, and the professor never
showed up. Can I send Pitt a bill
for $8.00?

0 I saw an editorial cartoon
that posed this question: "If Presi-
dent Reagan wasn't lying about
his role in the Iran-Contra deba-
cle, why did hehave the end of
his nose cut off last month?"

’ 0| was walking through the '

Student -Union some time ago,
- and someone tried to hand me a

copy of the New Testament. Sor-
ry whoever you were, but I
managed to make it through 12
years of Catholic schools with my
atheism intact, and a grinning
Bible hander-outer just ain't gon-
na change that.

0 I recently went to a local state
park for a day of fun in the sun.
However, when I arrived, there
was a big sign that read: "No im-
moral conduct." Geewhiz, I was
ready to spend my day fornicat-
ing, making lewd suggestions to
passersby and reading Dr. Ruth,
but because of that sign, I
couldn't. As a result, I had a rot-
ten stay at the local state park.

0 Last year, I thought that the
Goldengirls were useless and that
they degraded themselves and
Pitt. This year, I still think the
same thing.

0 Come write for The Pitt
News, it really can become a
stepping stone to bigger and bet-
ter things. Just ask our newest
celebrity and golden boy of the
local media, Mark R. Brown. Be-
cause of his involvement with the
Afghan rebels, Mark has actually
been featured in an article in the
The Pittsburgh Press and been in-
terviewed on Phil Musick’s A
talkshow. ~

0 Last July, I saw the Grateful
Dead and Bob Dylan concert in
Philly. I was milling around the
stadium with some 80,000 other
fans and, judging from the clothes
people wore (or didn't wear), the
politics discussed and the trust-
‘ing, friendly nature of everyone
I met, I couldn't tell that this was
1987 and not 1967. How did we
get sidetracked? Why do the
young people of today view the
world with such complacency?

0 Snow White is on its way out
of the theaters, but fear not! Walt
Disney Studios is releasing Cin-
derella on Nov. 14.

0 Hey everybody! There's an

experimental newspaper that

Some questions for the dormant  

floats around here about every
two weeks called The Student
Union. If you see it, grab it. You
won't be dissappointed.

0 Back to complacency, why
don't we stage a protest? We'd
need a cause  how about pro-
testing the lines we have to stand
in by holding a "line—in"? We
could form one huge line that
snaked across the campus. We
could snarl some traffic, trample
some flowers, maybe even get ar-
rested. Protesting military inter-
vention abroad it ain't, but it's a
start. ’

0 While I was in the cafeteria
yesterday (the first time in two
years), I noticed what a nauseat-

ingly secure existence people‘

who live in the dorms lead — if
you can call it an existence. Evi-
dently, not having to deal with
slumlords, bounced checks and
long walks to school (through
eight feet of snow, uphill both
ways) makes one cliquey, petty
and superficial.

0 Gary Vincent played at Den-
ny’s last weekend. My, my, my,
my, my —- what a welcome back
to Pittsburgh. Thanks Gary.

0 Why do people have such
poor taste? In the last year, Bon
Jovi played at least three sold-out
concerts here. Next week, James
Taylor will play at the Syria
Mosque, and I'll bet you that only
half the seats will be occupied.

0 Somebody ought to put "In"
and "Out” signs on the Bigelow
entrance to the Cathedral. There
are people coming and going
through both sets of revolving
doors, and someone is liable to
get killed.

0 I was sitting on my front
porch last night. Two gentlemen
walked past, both of whom had

white canes. Since one was walk- i

I ing in front of the other, it could

very well be the first actual case
of the blind leading the blind.

. _ 0_‘l'he, _D__elts ;have_,_their, rush’

functions listed in the Pitt Pro-
gram Council's calendar this
term. If I were an active Greek,
I would scream "foul” at the top
of my lungs because it gives them
an unfair advantage. If I werehin

a bad mood and wanted to start

a very tasty rumor, I would say
that, because Phil Moyer is the
SGB president, the Delts got the
listings for free. I'm neither of the
aforementioned, so I will not say
anything. '

0 Just kidding fellows. You're
in the calendar because, well, be-
cause you guys are organized, I
guess.

0 Where can I find this Theta
Nu Gamma? Do they have a
house somewhere? Their rush
functions are alluded to in The
Pitt News, but they never include
their address. I hear that they are
exempt from dry rush, and rumor
has it that people go there, drink
beer and smoke cigarettes. Some
of them take drugs.

0 In the bathroom of a local
bar, someone has written on the
wall that his penis is pulchri-
duinous. Look it up. The word,
that is, notthe penis.

0Though it doesn't happen
very often, some people get the
security deposits on their apart-
ments back at the end of their
leases. Do you realize that if your
landlord chooses to return the
deposit, he/she/the multinational

conglomerate, is supposed to pay '

you interest?

0 My 83-year-old grand-
mother's comment on Jane Fon-
da: "If she had as manysticking
out of her as she's had stuck in
her she'd be a porcupine."

0 Attention freshmen, you're
going‘ to be faced with a lot of
pressures in the near future, but
remember to "just say no," and
you'll be fine. Sayvno to chastity
and sobriety, that is.

American prejudice; aliveand well

JAMES
CRARY

Here we are in the Persian
Gulf, maties. On your left is the
Ayatollah Khomeini. On‘ your
right are the flames. You've been
shot by your ally, the Iraqis.
Hell's bells, but damn those
tricky terrorists. Japanese freight-
ers are burning. Italians freighters
are burning. And suburban Amer-
icans yawn, take out the car keys,
hop in for a long cruise to work.
What's gas cost these days?

Islamic culture is beautiful.
Don't believe me? Take out a
book on their architecture. Try
matching their calligraphy. Listen
to one of their prayers without the
preconceptions and prejudices

haired, wide-eyed Italian girl
slowly walked through the white
doorway and stopped.

”Rae Ann?” she asked, her

slightly, ”I’m Rae Ann.”

”Harry talks about all the things
that could be,” she says. ”I can't
tell you how many of the things
he says once he gets to know you
are started with a ‘what if?’ ”

”Doesn’t his behavior surprise
you, his screaming?” Jerry sits for
a moment, waiting for an answer
she doesn't have. .

she sees him wince, and she
watches almost with interest as
he tries another track.

you've been programmed to as-
sociate with terrorists. It can be,
and often is, very beautiful. To
judge Islam on the basis of Iran
fundamentalism would be like
judging Christianity on the basis
ofjimmy Swaggart, orludaism on
the basis of Meir Kahane. You'd
think everything was brutal and
ugly, if you based your judge-

' ments of religion on the political

spokesman for the extreme. Islam
is beautiful, no need to be
anti-Arab. ‘

Now all this is pretty obvious,
‘but how does anti—Arab prejudice
fit into the practical situation. Af-
ter all, isn't the real reason we are
in the Persian Gulfto protect our
oil markets? Actually, America
has such‘ expensive military
equipment in the Persian Gulf be-
cause they want military
dominance of a region in which

social control is fast becoming an
issue of religious orientation. For
radical Moslem nations, America
isn't a commercially interested
entity, America is a ”Great Sa-
tan.” Should superstition and
money fornicate in this way?
America is letting her allies
down, no question. Our Nation-
al Security Council resembles
nothing so much as the Nazi
Party Gestapo apparatus. Their
tactics resemble the ”night of
fog,” where the military police
knocked down doors in Germa-
ny, to drag off the suspected
leftists to be shot or interned. as
sl-ave labor. Meanwhile, in the
Persian Gulf, we confront a cul-
ture we have prejudiced out of all
reason with military equipment
produced at nightmarish expense
which cannot even protect itself
from World War II floating mines.

Now, I don't mean to be nebby.
The basis for a future reconcili-

ation with Islam (which is inevita- -

ble, because they represent a fifth
of the world, and won't be killed
off by like AIDS — they're too

zealous for that particular brand 5’

‘of ”scourge of God" shampoo),

comes from an understanding
that privacy and individuality are
not threatened by the understand-
ing that we are one frail, blue
world, “revolving under a gener-
ous sun. I

This ”unity” is the basis, the
springboard, the point of depar-

ture in Islamic mysticism and is '

confirmed in the prayer, ”La Ila-
ha Illa ’L|ah.’ " No masked men,

She nodded, turned and slowly
walked out of the doorway and
then motioned her parents to

Little did I know at that
moment that this seemingly bash-

some of the best and most unfor-

After we lugged at least seven

Jerry looks at her with some-
thing less than interest. He thinks
for a while about the answers
she's given him", trying to find
some sort of pattern in them.

”It might help if you were to

”We’ve, been over that, I

next day.

We had a lot of fun that first
night. It was like we had known
each other for two years when it
had really been two hours.

I suppose that night was a
prelude to the next nine months
we would spend together as

roommates. Everytime I think

back to our freshman-year antics,
I just have to laugh.

We enjoyed many — too many
— good times together. The par-
ties. The bars. Forgetting our way
back to the dorms. Late night
winter sports. Tailgates  the
football games  although some
of the memories are vague. Hang-

ing in the Towers for whatever ,

reason. Hanging in the ”O” wait-
ing to watch the sun rise. All
those happy hours. Pledging.

Harry sits without ‘speaking. For
a moment, he feels as if the walls
are going to close on him, and he
considers killing the doctor to get
away. On the desk between the
two men, a tape recorder spins,
unaware that it records nothing.
‘Well, why don't you begin
with something about your life,’'
Jerry says. ”Tell me anything.”
”I rememeber one time, I was
hitchiking across the state with
Carla, we were going to the
beach, and some guy in a pick-
up truck gave us a ride. The cab
was full, and we had to ride in the

Panther
soccer
team
held in  
transition

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

If soccer coach Joe Luxbacher
expects a season similar to the
one last year, he'll have to expect
the younger members of the team
to deliver.

Last season the Panthers com-i
piled a 10-5-2 record en route to
one of their finest seasons in re-

" cent years.

The 1987 team will have only
three seniors in Mike Grimes,
Kurt Weber and Dave Moss, but
these are three good players
nonetheless. Luxbacher is tes-
timony to that theory, but admits
changes in defense will haveto
be made.

"We have a good nucleus of
players returning,” said Lux-
bacher. "We lost our entire
defense of last year, but we'll try
to get our defense situated.”

They'll have to. get their
defense situated and do it fast.
The Panther schedule is no easy
task, so every win they can garn-
er will be important.

A "The Big East conference
games are with tough teams,”
Luxbacher said. "We have games
with non-conference team_s like
Ohio State University, Bucknell
and West Virginia, but they're
still games, and these are im-
portant.

By Beth Froelich
and Sam Tallarlcgo
Assistant Sports Editors

The women's cross country
team will enter its third straight
season this fall with a mix of ex-
perienced veterans and promis—_
ing newcomers.

Last year, the Lady Panthers
finished 5th in the Big East with
senior outdoor 1.0,000 meter
champ Lori Wood leading the
way. Women's track coach, Steve
Lewis, hopes that sophomore
Robin Hubauer will fill that va-
cant No. 1 position.

’'It will hurt our team not hav-
ing Wood with us anymore,” said
Lewis. '’I'm hoping that Hubauer
will not only take over Wood's
No. 1 position, but will have the.
same impact in the East that
Wood did.” i

The Lady Panther’s will have
assistance from sophomore
Kristin Laskowski, junior Gloria
Azeke, and senior Debbie Riley

Tuesday, September 8, i987 

Soccer team guard Dave Moss attempts a pass in one of last season's games.

"It's a competitive schedule, so
we will have our hands full,” ad-
ded Luxbacher.

The team began training at
their preseason camp on Aug. 26
playing scrimmages (including a
scrimmage on Sept. 1 against

, Mount Union College). it may

take a little more time to develop
because of the loss of. players.

"We're at a point where we

still have a long way to go. They .
did some weight lifting in the off-

Crosscountry teams see

last year's squad.
Coach Lewis especially looks

for Azeke to bring experience,_

leadership and improvement to
the team. '

Joining the veterans will be five
new freshmen recruits: Sue Alli-
son, Christine Chad, Cathy Chris-
sos, Lisa Fujak and Beth Mueller.

"The details about the incom-
ing freshmen are sketchy, but I
definitely think some will fit into
the top seven somewhere,” said
Lewis. "Chrissos has especially
good credentials. We have great
hopes for her.”

"All and all this year I think the
nucleus of the team will be the
more experienced returning run-

ners," continued Lewis. "'The

freshmen will add a lot of depth
we were lacking last year. I think
they will serve to lessen the gap
between the top seven runners’
times." i '

season, but how we're running
with the ball, working on skill
and tactics. Practices ha_ve tailed
off.

"We’re working really hard,
and we're at a point where we
need to play a game,” Luxbacher
said. ~

Not only do the Panthers have
inexperience as a strike against
them, but some small, nagging in-
juries as well. Luxbacher,
however, doesn't feel those inju-
ries will cause any aggravation or

cross country. Coach Lewis feels
that considering Pitt's women's
team is only entering it's third
season they are doing well.
"This is only our third season
working with a full team,” said
Lewis. '’I feel we are getting bet-
ter every year. Now that we don't
have to worry about getting a full
team to compete with, we'll start

worrying about improving our-

Big East standing.”
Like the.women's team, the

men's cross country team’ will-

have to rely upon a blend of ex-
perience and incoming freshmen
if they plan on challenging for the
Big East title later this fall.

Seniors Bob Weiner and Joe
Daniels, junior Waddie Freeman,
and sophomores Paul Friedrich,
Glenn Rhines and Paul Malone

As for the incoming runners; if
their success in high school is any

squad has the makings for a fu-

West Allegheny High graduate
Jim Hamilton was the WPIAL AA
cross country champion last year.
Keith Dowling, from York Cathol-
ic, was the AA two—mile champi-

Craig Wosher, from Carrick

  Fegley proves himself    

L...

..-.‘.«_........._..a..__.__. _..a-

By Christopher Sepesy I

Sports Editor

Bill Fegley is one tough kid.

He was told by recruits while
he was in high school that,
although he was tremendously

quick and agile, he would prob-.

ably never have the chance to
play, as he calls it, "big-time"
ball.

But, at the moment, it seems
Fegley is desperately trying to
overcome those odds.

Weighing in at 185 pounds and
standing a mere 5—foot-7, Fegley
seems to think the confidence he
has in himself alone is enough to
carry him through. And, believe
it or not, it seems to be working.

"| just give it all I've got,”
Fegley said. "If the coach wants
anything from me, I give it to him
plain and simple. Or, at least I try
my hardest.” A

Fegley, a junior from Enola,
Pa., and a 1985 graduate of East
Pennsboro High, cites tailback as
his natural position. But as a
walk-on player who made the
travel squad last season, Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried seems to
think Fegley will work better for
the team at a fullback position
along with starter Nate Heyward.

Again, although it is not his
preferred position, Fegley said he
has no qualms about being a
fullback.

"Like I said, I'll do anything the
coach wants, just as long as I'm
able to play," he said. "And I
really think that I'll be able to do
It.

"|t's not that I'm not strong -
it's just that people sometimes
only judge me by my size.”

Well, one person who isn't
doing this is Gottfried. He plans
to give Fegley his best chance
throughout the season.

"Billy made it through last year
with luck because of numbers,”
said Gottfried. "But he's proven
himself to a point. He's a small
but tough kid, and one I think

-we'll be able to depend on in a

crunch situation.”

Gottfried went on to say that he
will be watching to see just what
Fegley has gained in terms of
experience and training since last
season.

”Our sights are set to see
whether or not he has improved
since he played last year,” he
said. "We're really anxious_to see
if he has elevated himself as a
player to the next level. Camp
was a proving ground for him.

"He's got great balance, good
quickness and terrific ball han-
dling abilities. His blocking needs
to improve, but this will come
with time. .

"He'l| definitely get a good
Iook." .

This "good look" is exactly

with no strings attached

what Fegley is looking for. But
there is also something else.
Because he is a walk-on, Fegley
is not on scholarship. His hope
this year is to play well enough
to win himself one.

"When I was_in high school, I
had a lot of AA schools looking
at me, but my main goal was
always to play big—time ball.
That's the main reason I came to
Pitt. They looked at me play, but
they told me they couldn't give
me any money. I said that was
OK, just as long as I would be
able to get a chance‘ to try out,"
said Fegley.

Now that he is officially a
member of the team and because
he has no problems with the
position in the backfield in which
he has been placed, just what
does Fegley think about his
chances of making it through the
season?

"Wel|, I've worked out all sum-
mer with a lot of running and lift-
ing, so I'm physically prepared.
The only thing I'll need to work
on really is blocking. And then
there's Nate [Heyward] 

"When it comes down to it, I
know I'm faster than’ Nate, and
therefore, I shouldn't have any
problem to fill the spot _alongside
him."

Somehow an argument to this
last statement would seem rather
hard to find.

Stee l e rs
By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

Defensive end Darryl Sims, a

i 1985 first-round draft choice who
managed only two quarterback
sacks in two seasons, was waived
Monday as the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers cut their roster to 45 players.
Steelers coach Chuck Noll,
who once projected Sims as a
' dominating pass rusher, said the

former all-Big Ten defensive line- -

man from Wisconsin ”has the
physical ability, but that didn't
translate on the field  he lacked
instinct.”

”He has strength and speed,

but it didn't show up on the field
the way we thought it would,”
Noll said at his weekly news con-
ference. "Did he try? I don't think
that was it at all. I don't question
his want to do it.”
' The Steelers, coming off their
first winless preseason in 22
years, also waived defensive end
Charles Buchanan, guards Randy
Rasmussen and Charlie Dickey,
running back Rodney Carter and
tight ends Chris Kelley and Dan-
zell Lee.

 

, ,,—_2/. ‘

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, 8, I987

trim roster to final 45  

Placed on the injured reserve
list were offensive tackles Jim
Hansen, Pete Rostosky and Jerry
Quick and wide receiver Lyneal
Alston. The Steelers said two

‘other roster moves would be an-
nounced after the players are
contacted.

Sims, warned last week by Noll
he was in danger of losing his
job, played poorly in the Steelers’
preseason-ending 26-20 loss to
the New York Giants, constantly
being overpowered at the line of
scrimmage.

Noll said Sims was beaten out
by 1981 first-round draft choice
Keith Gary, who was second on
the team with‘ 6 quarterback
sacks last season. Gary had one
of the Steelers’ three sacks against
the Giants.

”Keith has been hampered by
injuries, but he showed he can do
it and he wants to do it,” Noll
said.

Steelers’ coaches have com-
plained privately the last two
years that the 6-foot-3,
285-pound Sims reported to train-

ing camp out of shape, but Noll
said that wasn't a factor in his
release.

’’I don't think that affects your
instincts,” he said. '

Sims’ departure means the
Steelers will get no contributions
at the start of the season from two
of their last three No. 1 draft
choices. The Steelers have yet to
sign first-round pick Rod Wood-
son, and negotiations between
the team and the former Purdue
cornerback’s agent, Marvin
Demoff, broke down over the
weekend.

Rasmussen's release was con-
sidered somewhat of a surprise
since he was being used as a long
snapper. He was beaten out by
Paul Oswald, an 11th-round draft
choice from Kansas.’

Carter was used mainly as a
third-down receiver — a role
formerly held by the injured Rich
Erenberg — but lost his roster spot
to Dwight Stone, a free agent
from Middle Tennessee State
who has been timed at 4.3 sec-
onds in the 40-yard dash.

Kelley, a seventh-round draft
choice from Akron, and Lee, a
free agent from Lamar, were beat-
en out by Theo Young, a 12th-
round draft choice from Arkansas
who had three receptions for 38_
yards against the Giants.

Noll also said former starting
left guard Craig Wolfley, who
played left tackle for the first time
against the Giants, probably will
start Sunday's regular season
opener against the San Francisco
49ers. Wolfley was pressed into

his new job after injuries to Ray

Pinney and Mark Behning, who
is out for six to eight weeks with
an Achilles tendon injury.

”Wolf played well for us,” Noll
said. ”He doesn't have all the
subtleties of the position, but he's
the way to go right now.”

The Steelers were 0-4 and the
49ers were 3-2 in the preseason.
The Steelers haven't played the
49ers since 1984, when they
won 20-17 in San Francisco, the
only |oss’suffered by the Super
Bowl champion 49ers that
season. -
