Student group advocates
apparel oversight

Gideon Bradshaw .
Staff Wrz'ter

One student organization believes
that the University needs to rethink
where it gets its apparel. And it is win-
ning over other groups, as well.
Pitt’s chapter of-' Americans for an
Informed Democracy, an on—campus
political advocacy group, wants the
University to affiliate itself with the

Worker Rights Consortium, an orga— '

nization that monitors labor condi-
tions internationally. The University
is currently affiliated with the Fair
Labor Association, another organiza-
tion that monitors labor conditions
and serves as an avenue of complaint
for workers in the garment and other

‘industries. Both organizations are

headquartered in Washington D.C.
AIDemocracy co-presidentjoe
Thomas said the Fair Labor Asso-
ciation has displayed a track record
of favoring apparel companies. Un-

= like the Worker Rights Consortium,

unions and businesses can affiliate
with the Fair Labor Association.

Thomas respects the University’s
effort in joining with the Fair Labor
Association, but he believes Pitt was
ill-advised to rely -solely on the Fair
Labor Association’s approval of ap-
parel companies.

He said the initiative for the Uni-
versityto join the Worker Rights Con-
sortium will ensure that Pitt enters '
apparel contracts only with apparel
companies that uphold certain stan-
dards of treatment for the workers in
their factories.

University spokesman John Fe-
dele indicated that Pitt has no plans
of changing its policy.

“The University is satisﬁed with
the [Fair Labor Association] and its
work in this area,” Fedele said in an
email. “The correspondence received
by the Chancellor’s Office does not
alter this position.”

Scott Nova, the executive director
of the Worker Rights Consortium,
said the organization is the only in-
dependent monitoring apparatus
for labor conditions that operates
globally. A large part of its mission is
to ensure that universities get their
apparel from companies that uphold
its labor standards.

While looking into violations 
against workers all over the world
may sound like a hefty load, the
Worker Rights Consortium relies on
a global network of investigators.

“Most of our investigations are
launched in response to worker com-
plaints through groups they trust,”
Nova said. ~ ’

According to Nova, the organiza-
tion reports any violations it uncov-
ers.

He said that the Worker Rights
Consortium has secured the ﬁr-
ing of individuals responsible for a
campaign of threats and intimidation
against the leaders of a labor union
operating at a major apparel com-
pany’s factory in Honduras. .

Nova emphasized that the Worker
Rights Consortium has never ac-
cepted money from businesses or
labor unions._ Affiliate colleges and
universities, currently numbering
more than 180, pay a minimum of
$1,500 annually to the consortium
or one percent of the licensing fees
they receive for apparel sales. Pay-
ing the fee ensures that the Worker
Rights Consortium will contact Pitt
to inform them if an apparel supplier
violates workplace ethics. I

Heeral Coleman, the Fair Labor
Association’s director of outreach and
communications, addressed the al-
legations of those who, like Thomas,
say the Fair Labor Association may
favor the companies from which it

For the time being, students must
continue to stand at unmarked stu-
dent shuttle stops around campus,

. but with the impending success of

one Student Government Board
member’s initiative, confusion
about where shuttles stop won’t last
for long. .
Board member Halim Genus said
he’s been meeting with SGB Trans-
portation and Safety Chair Richard
White and Pitt Director of Parking,
Transportation and Services Kevin
Sheehy to discuss the ﬁnal stages of
the project, which aims to mark all
of the stops along the 10A shuttle
route. Genus said that as the project
stands, he has a “yes from,all sides”
to continue progress on the project.
Genus prefaced the sharing of
his initiative’s success with a light-

hearted joke to those gathered in

Nordy’s Place in the William Pitt
Union for the Student Government
Board—responsiblefor distributing

funds from the more than $2 million
Student Activities Fund -— public
meeting Tuesday night.

' “I was going to tell a joke about
pizza, but it was too cheesy,” Genus
said withasmile to the 30 or so peo-
ple gathered in the audience before
continuing to address the initiative’s
progress. “I wish I had a ‘mission ac-
complished’ barmer behind me — we
did it!” Constructing marked shuttle
stops around campus for shuttle
routes was one of Genus’ points on
his platform when he ran for Board
last year. ’

Genus said the project does not
currently have atimeline, but White,
who will design the shuttle stop signs,
said they hope to have the project
implemented by the end of this year
or early next year. '

Board President James Landre-
neau reiterated comments made in

_ previous public meetings in regard
to the national and SGB elections. ‘ ‘

Landreneau invited students‘ to

- attend a debate between the College

SGB encourages” election participation

College Libertarians, which will be
tailored to national issues concern-

ing students. The debate will be held .

tonight at9 p.m. inroom 120 ofDavid
Lawrence.Hall. ,

He also extended an invitation
to students for the presidential elec-
tion results watch party hosted by
the First Year Mentor Ofﬁce with
help from SGB on Nov. 6, at 4 p.m.
in Nordy’s Place. .

Elections Committee Chair Annie

’ Brown urged students considering

attending the results watch party to
attend activities throughout the eve-
ning, including an SGB presidential

_ debate co-moderatedby WPTS and

The Pitt News that will be held from
5:30 to 7p.m. leadingup to the results
announcement. .

But students are gearing up for
more than just the presidential elec-
tion. Campaigningfor this year’s SGB
election officially begins Thursday, at
which time candidates will be free to
visit with student groups on campus.

all affiliated companies to uphold the standards
laid out in the associat1'on’s code of conduct.
According to Coleman, companies affiliated
with the Fair Labor Association must conduct
internal monitoring of all facilities that supply
them. The association also makes independent
visits to inspect affiliates’ factories and check_
for violations of the code of conduct, which all

affiliates must agree to uphold.

The code instructs companies and other
organizations and affiliates to observe high
standards of treatment for its workers and to
pay them at least the legal minimum wage for
the country in which they work.

b Any risks to workers-are addressed im-
mediately through recommendations to the
company involved, and all reports on violations
are published on the organization’s website.

“One look at any [Fair Labor Association]
report proves the organization’s credibility and
independence,” Coleman said over email, add-

ing that assessments are conducted without any
involvement from companies.

The Fair LaborAssociation’s board of direc-
tors includes representatives from human rights
and labor organizations as well as universities
and companies," Coleman added.

But these statements on the Fair Labor As-
sociation’s behalf have not slowed the growth
of protest against the organization on campus.

Thomas, a junior who majors in biology
and political science, and Pitt alum Cory Rodg-
ers co—founded Pitt’s chapter of AIDemocracy
injanuary 2011. The Pitt chapter has become
more active duringthis semester, Thomas said,
estimating that at least 40 members attend the
weekly group meetings. 1 -

As part of its efforts, the chapter recently
teamed up with other campus’ organizations to

jointly sign a letter to Chancellor Mark Norden—
bergthat asks the University to join the Worker
Rights Consortium.

“University apparel is how we as a Pitt com-
munity represent ourselves, and we no longer
will be represented by clothing made in sweat-

shops,” states the letter, signed by almost 40

student groups collectively calling themselves

No Sweat: Pitt Coalition Against Sweatshops. .-

About a month ago, Thomas and other
members of AIDemo_cracy began dropping off‘
copies of No Sweat’s letter at the Chancellor’s
Office every week. '

Wasi Mohamed, a sophomore who serves
as executive board president of the Resident
Student Association, said that the RSA is among
the 40 groups who joined the effort.

, Thomas said that they have not received a
direct response yet from the University’s ad-
ministration.

Whentold about Fedele’s response regarding
Pitt maintaining its current affiliation, Thomas
said that he would continue his efforts, main-
taining that he considered the Fair Labor As-
sociation an insufficient safeguard for garment
workers’ rights.

“We will continue to work on this issue
because we, as Pitt students, believe that the
[Worker Rights Consortium] is in ourbest inter-
est as an institution,” Thomas said in an email.

Speaking after a joint Resident Student As-
sociation and AIDemocracy event held on the

  

evening of Oct. 11, Thomas said he believed
that students were capable of inﬂuencing policy
that couldimprove conditions in the garment
industry. '

“We have buying power,” Thomas said. “We
have massive buying power.” «

As a case in point, Thomas and Mohamed
cited labor-rights-friendly apparel company
Alta Gracia as a success story. The company
— named after the Dominican Republic village
in which its factory is located —— was founded

after Knights Apparel, the organizations parent '

company, asked students what changes they
wanted to see in the garment industry.

Rachel Taber, community education coor-
dinator for Alta Gracia, said that thanks to the
efforts of students, the factory adheres carefully
to safety measures such as adequate ventilation
and ﬁre  ’

Additionally, the company pays its workers
—who make T—shirts that are sold in more than
800 university bookstores in the U.S. — more
than three times the legal minimum wage inthe

and really competitive candidates, so it should
be an interesting fall,” Brown said. “Deﬁnitely
have the candidates come speak to yourclubs;
these are the people who will be deciding how
much money you will g .”

Brown said she can arrange to have can-
didates speak at club meetings at a group’s
request.

Board member Alex Murdoch agreed that
students should be open to meeting with the
candidates.

“Let these people come speak at your meet-
ing, because they are the people who will be us
in the coming months,” Murdoch said.

Students can vote for next year’s Board on-
line from the my.pitt portal-on Nov. 15.

Landreneau reminded students that they
have an opportunity to speak with the cur-
rent Board this weekend at an informal town
hall meeting, He said that the purpose of the
event, which will be held Sunday, Oct. 28, at 7
p.m. in Sutherland Hall lobby, is to present stu-
dents with the opportunity to approach Board
members, committee chairs and himselfabout
campus issues.

Landreneau said it will likely: be “the ﬁrst, l

and maybe only, town hall meeting” of the se-
mester.

arrived at this ﬁgure by examining a Worker
Rights Consortium reportthat detailed the living
wage, which she said is usually higher than the
legal minimum wage, for the country.

“It’s very impressive what that living wage
has allowed people to do,” Taber said, adding
that it has enabled manyfamilies to build multi-
room houses and obtain running water.

Knights Apparel could not be reached for
comment. . Z

Mohamed said that Alta Gracia, headquar-
tered in South Carolina, has served as an ex-
ample for those seeking social change. RSA pur~
chased this year’s T—shirts, which it distributes

paid $8 for each shirt and has distributed about

Rise of technolo   mandates
better education or everyone  

Daniel Okwaisie
Columnist

He pinch-zooms in on a dinner

menu on a sleek tablet at a restau- ’

rant table. They share a little joke
before he punches in their or-
ders on the tablet. He then scrolls
over the music playlist and selects
Peabo Bryson and Roberta Flack’s
“Tonight I Celebrate My Love”
before stowing the tablet away
to give them room on the table.
If Bryson’s song does indeed
live on to be a timeless classic,
I may have succeeded in de-
scribing a college _couple’s first
anniversary date 20 years from
now: a time when the iPad will
probably have succeeded in its
coup on waiters and waitresses
in restaurants on a large scale.
Technology has rapidly become
sophisticated enough to under-
take entire modes of production
with little human intervention
across economies in the devel-
oped world. This shift is a key
feature of what economists
have called the progression to
a “knowledge economy” — an
economy where repetitive skills
like taking orders will not suf-

fice because a machine can do
it faster, without asking for sick
days with pay.

Skill obsoletion is likely to be
the routine under rapid technol-
ogy growth. Thus, this knowledge
economy will thrive on innova-
tion, skill diversiﬁcation and the
utilization_of theoretical knowl-
‘edge that cannot be gained except

. through higher education. Unfor-

tpnately, in our discourse about
higher education today, it has be-
come somewhat of the norm that
“college is not for everyone,” and
in a stretch toward narcissism,
-some students, while shrouded in
their P_itt hoodies, are even will-
ing to go the extra mile to argue
that indeed some students in col-
lege now shouldn’t be here and
are a waste of resources. This
opinion is not only obtrusively
egotistic —-— because such people
never regard themselves as part
of the misfits —+ but also an un-
informed one. I
To be fair, a lot of these people
do use the term “college” rigidly
to refer to four-year institutions
.such as our own. And in doing
so, they are able to argue that,
indeed, not everybody is suited

to take on the rigors of college
and that such people should at-
tend technical institutions and
apprenticeship programs in-
stead. I agree that probably not
everyone is suited for the current
college environment, but I cannot
accept this prescription to solve
it. Instead of focusing on turning
such people away from colleges
to technical schools andthe like,
why isn’t the debate focused on
bringing the technicality of the

technical institutions into the

college? What’s wrong with Pitt
starting, for example, a carpentry
program, and linking it to a mi-
nor in the Katz business school?

It takes a gross underestima-
tion of the power of technology
to revolutionize entire industries
to ask one to study a monoto-
nous skill set like those learned in
technical and vocational schools
or apprenticeships. We may not
see the subtle similarity, but this
endeavor to push people to un-
dergo such training is like a young
man in the 1820s training to use
the sickle when the combine har-
vester was a decade around the

It is true that a lot of students walk out

MEN’S SOCCER

Pitt keeps it close a

It wasn’t too long ago that‘ the Pitt men’s
soccer team was undefeated and aspiring
to accomplish big things. But in the time
since then, the Big East season has gone
horribly wrong for the Panthers.

Following a 2-1 defeat to the University
of Connecticut Huskies,‘ Pitt is now 0-7 in
Big East play, with only one game left in
the season.

The night started out promising for the
struggling Panthers, who_ held a 1-0 lead

._,_’ going into halftime, something that only



 

one other team has been able to do all year
against the No. 4—ranked Huskies.

The lone Panthers goal came in the last
second of the 34th minute. Freshman Nick
Wysong sent a cross through the box that
UCOnn goalie Andre Blake deﬂected right
to Pitt senior Andy Clifford. Clifford then
sent the ball into the back of the net, giving
Pitt a 0ne—goal lead.

Wysong said the goal was a matter of
positioning and that Clifford scoring inhis
last home game was special.

“Cliff was in the right spot at the right
time, and it was great to see a senior score
on senior day,” Wysong said.

Former Panthers football players in the
NFL continued their collective streakfof
recording the most consecutive weeks with
a touchdown last week. .

_At 26, Pitt’s alumni hold the longest
active streak among all schools that have
players in the league.

With Eagles running back Lesean Mc-
Coy (Pitt 2007-2008) on a bye, the touch-
down production would have to come from
another Pitt alum to keep the streak alive
in week seven. McCoy has recorded a
touchdown in three of his last ﬁve games.

It was another running back, LaR0d
Stephens-Howling of Arizona, who man-
aged to extend Pitt’s scoring run when he
plunged through the Minnesota defense at
the goal line for the Cardinals’ first score of
their game against the Minnesota Vikings.

Stephens-Howling (Pitt 2006-2008)
broke out in his second start of the sea-

son. The “Hyphen”, as his teammates call

wling continues  touchdown streak

him, has competed with William Powell
for the majority of carries since starter
Beanie Wells was injured. He rushed for
a career-high 104 yards on 20 carries and
tacked on another 45 yards receiving with
four catches. Look for him to get just as
many touches next week against a tough
San Francisco defense.

Despite Stephens—Howling’s perfor-
mance,‘ the Cardinals lost the game'21-14,
and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald was
unable to surpass 60 yards for the first
time in five weeks.

° Fitzgerald (Pitt 2002-2003) only man-
aged four receptions for 29 yards from
backup qﬁarterback John Skelton. Regu-
lar starter Kevin Kolb looks to be out for
several more weeks with a rib injury, so
Fitzgerald and Skelton must ﬁnd a way to
connect quickly.

Andy Lee (Pitt 2000-2004) punted
strongly in a 49ers win against the Se-
ahawks. He pinned four of his season—high

. Unfortunately, the Panthers did not
hold the lead past halftime.
Just about 12 minutes after the break,

“ the Huskies (13—1-1, 5-1-1)‘ tied the game

with a simple exchange.

After receiving a nice long pass from
Max Wasserman, senior midﬁelder Carlos
Alvarez sent a blistering shot in from 35
yards out that left Pitt freshmangoalie Dan
Lynd helpless to stop it.

“That ﬁrst goal was a rip, so there really
was nothing I could do about that one,”
Lynd said after the game. i

Following the Huskies’ ﬁrst goal, the

, one for 66 yards. 0 .

Defensive end Jabaal Sheard (Pitt 2007-
2010) made a mere two solo tackles, as the
Browns fell to the Colts, 17-13. ‘

The Panthers in the NFL will look to
keep their streak going for a 27th con-
secutive week, but even if they succeed,
they are far, far away from the all-time
mark.:_Alurf1ni of the University of Miami
recorded touchdowns 149 weeks in a row
(a period of timeispanning from 2002 until
last year) relying on a nucleus of Clinton
Pbrtis", Edgerrin James, Andre Johnson
and Reggie Wayne.

Maybe" McCoy and Fitzgerald can carry
the team to match Miami’s count three
years from now. Perhaps even Lee could
get in this scoring mix on a fake punt. 1

‘Panthers (6-8-2, 0-7-0) had a golden op— .

portunity to retake the lead.

After receiving the ball off a deﬂection,
sophomore midﬁelder Matt Walbert took
control of the ball and made a run toward
the net. V

But he shot just wide, missing the net

' by a mere foot.

Following the near equalizer, UConn
scored the game—winning goal on a nice
play by Alvarez. ’ _

. Alvarez, who scored both of the UConn
goals, secured a nice through ball pass
from Adria Beso, and then eluded Lynd
to send the ball into the net for the game
winner. .

‘_‘I’m not really’ sure what_happened on

that second goal, but I heard someone say it
was a missed assignment. I know we didn’t
get the win, but I’m really happy with the
way we played,” Lynd said after the game.

Pitt head coachjoe Luxbacher, despite
the end result, praised the performance

‘ of his team’s backline, led by junior co-

captain A1ex.Harrison.

“We had a plan and we stuck to it to-
night. We knew that they would most likely
control the ball more than we would, but
we also knew that we needed to take advan-
tage of some chances. We had three or four
really good chances, including the one that
[Matt] Walbert should have scored. But it’s
still a loss and we’re certainly not happy
with that,” Luxbacher said after the game.

The set of missed chances really did
cost the Panthers, who could’ve very eas—
ily beaten UConn and, in doing so, would
have created a bright spot for the seniors
from this tough season.

After the game, Luxbacher spoke to his
team’s effort in the circumstances.

“We played a full 90 minutes tonight,
but we certainly missed some guys. We
don’t like to make excuses for these losses,
but when you’re playing top—ten teams ev-
ery game, those games become a lot easier‘?
if you’re at full strength. This year, we’ve
missed key guys at key points,” he said.

The Panthers’ ﬁnal game is away at Vil-
lanova on Saturday. Kickoff is scheduled
for noon. I
