City Halts SUAnnex Concert SGB Considers Revival 

Of Undergrad Review  

BY BILL MOORE

‘The Student Government Board
(SGB) evaluated, the goals and

purposes of the Undergraduate '

Academic Review (UAR) at their
Wednesday meeting in hopes of
reviving the publication in the near
future.

The UAR ceased publication last

‘year following disagreements be-

tween Student Government and the
UAR staff over the booklet’s
format. '

‘The Board’ members discussed.

possible questions to be included in
the revised UAR survey sheet and
argued the question of a pro-

-fessor’s right to withhold the

survey’s results from publication.

‘ ‘If a teacher withholds the results"
from his class, it should say so in
the book,” said SGB member
Bruce Keeler.

Other Board_ members agreed 1
with Keeler adding. that it should ,
also be. noted if a professor refuses ‘

to allow his class to be surveyed.

  /vleds, Dents RipSenate Bill

in Allegheny County, labeled the
bill a “deprivation of civil
liberties.”

“To point a finger at some poor
med student and say ‘Uncle Sam
Wants You’ sounds like involuntary

‘servitude to me,” said Carroll. He
was convinced it would be possible

to do voluntarily what the Senate
wants to do by force.

“It seems they could do some-
thing like establishing a loan
arrangement whereby the govern-
ment would provide students with
money to go through‘ school in
return for several years of service.
But the proposed method is un-
fair.”

However, Carroll expressed con-

fidence the bill would never pass
the House of Representatives.
“The US Seante is far more
irresponsible than the House,” he
explained. “Members of the
House really do their homework
before they vote. I’m sure the ﬁnal
compromise will be fine.”

Should the bill be put into law as it

is, Carroll simply stated “I’d hate
to be a patient for one of these
doctors.”

School were eager to share their
negative reactions to the Senate
measure. ~ -

complete corporate entity and the
Law School and the Medical
School, and the Graduate School of
Public Health are not separate
entities in themselves. ,

Faculty in those schools will later
argue that their respective faculties
should be separated from a large
all encompassing bargaining unit,
where they fear their special inter- ‘
ests will not be easily satisﬁed.

Dutton supported his claim by
explaining the faculty is governed
by one faculty handbook which sets
down one policy for the general
functioning of all faculty.

ments to the University, whether or

Because Lawrence does not be-

has asked all parties to inform him ~

of open dates in November when

After Dutton completes his testi-
mony today, his assistant Gene

stand and explain the standard
operating procedures of the Uni-

The six faculty organizations bid-

the Pitt faculty are: the American
Association of University Profes-
sors, the Pitt Professional Union,
the Pennsylvania State Educational
Association of the School of Medi-
cine, and the Faculty Association of
the v Graduate School of Public
Health.

Each of the groups maintain
different positions as to the proper
composition of a collective bar-
gaining unit. Once the labor board
‘makes a determination onga proper
unit, the members of that unit will

forced to pool their resources to
buy practice ice time. The annual
membership fees of $25 have

already been spent paying for a‘

month’s practice ice time, accord-
ing to the club’s advisor, Dr.
Michael Sherman.

The Allocations Committee grant-
ed only half of the requested $2340
September 18 after reviewing a
budget which included a debt
incurred by the club last year as
they operated on inadequate funds.

“We owed them $13,000,” said
“It was on our deﬁcit
sheet. We put it down as an
expense, so they took it off the
$2340. That's how we got the
$1040 ﬁgure. But Student Go-
vernment President Mike Furick
said .they could give us $100 for
campus advertisng, which brought
the total to $1140." _

Hockey Club Treasurer John De
F azio said, “If the budget" had been
properly arranged in the first place,
we’d have gotten the $2340. But
we had the debt and didn’t know
how to list it, so it went on the-
budget. Nobody corrected it, so
that’s how it went to the Alloca-
tions Committee.”

Assistant Director of Student-Ac-
tivities Lori Seman explained the
allocation procedure.’ “In the
Hockey Club's case, the Alloca-
tions Committee recommended

‘$100 to the Student Government

Board. The Board gave the club
$100 more, and now the budget is
technically dead. It’s been acted’
upon by the Board, and no more
requested revisions can be submit-
ted.“

Seman admitted, however, that
the club can submit an emergency
request to the Committee and ask

for things which were not included
on the original budget but are now
needed.” Seman said the emer-
gency request would probably be
-granted ifthe club cou1dn’t exist on
the present budget, but added,
“We can't give money we don’t
have."

DeFazio cited the. need for sub-
mitting such a request. noting,
"The orginal budget was stripped
down to operating essentials such
as arena dues and road transporta-
tion, which, incidentallly. is by
automobile and not by bus. We
didn‘t dare ask for practice ice
time, uniforms. or equipment.”
Hagins added, “The uniforms we
have now are pretty shabby, and
the skates and padding are from
last year, too."

“We’re going to be skating in a
lot of pr'e-NHL games, with up to
14,000 people watching. That’s
14,000 people watching the Uni-
versity of. Pitsburgh playing with
second-rate uniforms and equip-
ment,” DeFazio said.

"We‘ve already exhausted all the
ice time funds. We're paying out
of our own pockets," said Hagins.
"lfwe don’t get more money, we'll
have to cut practice to twice a
week, but that will affect our game
play." The club is presently
practicing three times weekly.

‘flf we want to get University top‘

dollar, we’re going to have to make
ourselves look good enough to
deserve it,” said Hagins. “We
don't have much money to work
with right now, but the right people
are here. It's a matter of organiza-
tion now. Up to now the club's
been a group of hockey players.
Now it's turning into a business,
just like footb_all or basketball, and
we need new ways to finance itz.
Progress is catching up to us.”

The Pitt Hockey Club is defending
the Western Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate ,Hockey ‘Association
championship for the fourth con-
secutive year.

He promised to “urge” ODI

he could not “force" them to meet. '

“We would like to have student

The two-block. committee deals
with .the two block area surround,-y
ing "the Stludent"Un-ion Annex,
according to Phillips.

“Historically speaking‘ the area
where the Annex is located has
long been an area of hostility
between the University and the
community. The University ﬁnally
agreed with the community to
make that area one which could
benefit both parties. The building

-was supposed to be shared,” said-

Phillips.

She explained ODI had envisioned
the Annex to be a building utilized
for meetings of student groups and
community organizations.

she stressed the fact these people
were not all Pitt students.
Apparently a “big party” held
during the first weekend of this
term as one of the problem-causing
events. “There was lots of trouble
there, even worse than last
Spring,” she said. .
ODI had tried all summer to
arrange a meeting with University
officials to discuss the problem,
and-according to Phillips nobody
responded to the invitation.
Phillips repeated an invitation for
students and faculty to become
involved in the community organi-
zation. “We know the students

grams of a controlled substance,
conspiracy, and possession with
intent to deliver were ﬁled in the

The six students were arrested
shortly before 10 pm Saturday

Two and one-half pounds of mari-

raid, with an estaimated street

school, said, “At first it’s 25% of
all graduates that have to serve.
Then they’ll say 50%, and pretty
soon the government will claim
they neediall of us. I’d say the plan
borders on socialism.”

Senior Paul Petrunak pointed out
there are very few areas in our
country, whether rural,. urban, or
slum, which aren’t in need of

dentists. “So I don’t see why they '

should tell us we have to jeopardize
our practices by working in under-
developed areas.”

Another senior, Jerry Petro, sug-
gested an alternative solution to
the problem. “The government
should air-lift tons of toothpaste

-and dental floss to any place that

needs the help that bad...and tell
them to 'watch between-meal
treats."

Rejecting Cooperation

SGAC: Anti-Progressivism

BY MICHAEL CLINTON

This is the third in a series of
articles on the Student Government
Allocations Committee.

As a recognized student
organization, the Pitt News must
submitan ‘annual budget for oper-
ating expenses to the" Student
Government Allocations Commit-
tee (SGAC).

Unlike most other student organi-
zations however, the Pitt News

receives only a small portion of its .

funds from the SGA‘C (approxi-
mately 23 percent). The newspa-
per’s major sources of income
result from local ‘and national
advertising and faculty and_ admin-

istration fees. ‘_ -

‘Although the Pitt News generates
most of its own income, it has been
customary that any surplus in the
paper’s account at the end of each
fiscal year be turned over to the
SGAC. The logic behind this action

has been that the Pitt News is a.

student organization, and that the
SGAC-’s-relatively small contribu-

"tion to the annual anticipated

income‘ is responsible for generat-
ing the large surplus usually re-
turned to them each year. This is a
somewhat naive understanding of
the financing of any newspaper,
including the Pitt News.

During contract renewal negotia-

- _tions' last summer, the Allocations.
Committee claimed they should

have direct control over all of the
paper’s expenditures--money they
deemed relevant to the operations
of a newspaper.

Three years ago an Allocations
Committee attempted to eliminate
funds,for an Associated Press Wire
Service which is an essential tool
for any business related to the

media. This year the committee
objected to the funding of an
additional compugraphic machine-.—
This machine is a copy typing
machine, which reduces printing’
costs, and allows for a more
professional product. '

Each student organization usually ,

knows its need best, yet the SGAC
seems to ignore this fact. Prior to
the beginning of contract negotia-
tions, the Pitt News management
reduced its allocations request by
$40,000 in order to cooperate with
SG and alleviate the committee’s
potential concerns.

Throughout the negotiations, the
Allocations Committee persistently
attempted to impose ﬁnancial con-
trols on the Pitt News and ques-
tioned every expense item on the
budget.

In an effort to respond even

‘further to the concerns of the

SGAC, Pitt News representatives
suggested the committee conduct.
monthly audits of the paper's
financial records, and asked the
SGAC to participate in the opera-
tional decision making processes of
the newspaper. The committee was
also assured that various financial
controls are in effect through the
jurisdiction of Student Affairs ad-
ministrators. V

Still unsatisfied, however, the
committee insisted upon the final
decision making power on all
expenditures of funds," insulting
the competence of both the Pitt
News staff and the administration.

Many of us at the newspaper were
disillusioned with the tactics of the
SGAC. We had entered the negoti-
ations with plans for expansion and
money-saving ideas for the Pitt
News. and Student Government 0
(SG) and hopeful of maintaining

scorn. The dominant question, thus, becomes one of credibility;

It is extremely

difﬁcult to accept Skrabut’s theory that three

' intelligent men, one a prominent Pittsburgh attorney, would author a

’ report so haphazaidly that “participles dangling” and correct syntax

would be reasons for not releasing the report.

And furthermore Skrabut claims this issue has become a controversy
only because “the report just happens to be in the limelight because
it’s security and concerns people's daily lives." This is exactly the
reason why the report should have been made public in the first place.
Quite clearly, the lives of students, faculty, and administrators are
more important than registration or student accounts, precedents
offered by Skrabut for the legitimacy of the report’s secrecy.

it is appalling anduncoriceivable that such an important document

the cooperative relationship be-
tween the paper and SG. Instead
we were confronted with pettiness.
One of the main "ideas that the
paper presented to the committee
was to allow the Pitt News toretain
its surplus.. With the proper safe
investments over a period of years,
equity could build eventually per-
mitting financial independence
from Student Government. _
Financial independence would
make it possible for the Pitt News
to become a daily publication with a
larger circulation, and give us the
opportunity to buy additional pro-

_fessional equipment without addi-
tional expense to SG. It would also

benefit Student Government and
the student body by allowing the
allocations funds to be channeled
into other student organizations.

” However, the SGAC refused to
discuss or even consider this
possibility. "

The final agreement between the
Pitt News and the SGAC was a
disappointment to the staff of the
paper, because no progressive
ideas were accepted or instituted
by the SGAC. Without the compro-
mising efforts of SG President
Mike Furick, perhaps no agree-
ment would have been reached at’
all.

Financial independence of the Pitt
News would take several years to
establish, but even the beginnings

of this goal seem unachievable this '

year. Until an enlightened Alloca-
tions Committee comes along and
recognizes the benefits for both
parties involved, the Pitt News will
not be able to expand, or grow in
business sense. ' ‘
It is unfortunate that such anti-
progressive and power-conscious
attitudes pervade‘ with this years’
committee. In this case, not only
one student organization is affected
but the total student body is being
deprived of a better product.

Letter to 

the Editor

Allocations  

Dear Editor;

' In two articles about the Student

Government Allocations Commit-
tee, Tom Smith has lambasted the
policies and practices of one of the
most important parts of the Student
Government process. Though, I
personally feel that most of what
Mr. Smith has written is pure crap,
I don't want to single out any
specific issue he has discussed at
this time. I do, however, question
the fact that in no place in either
article does Mr. Smith mention the
fact that he was a member of the
Alocations Committee last year.

It is possible that he used the very

tactics last year that he is— con- .

demning this year. When present-
ing what you believe to be the

truth. T0m, Why don't you present

the whol truth? _ ‘~

last week he assessed your

The MAC urges anyone between
the ages of 17 and 66, with no
history of jaundice or hepatitis, to
donate. The blood supply has been
at a critically low level recently,
especially following the Labor Day
weekend.

To put it simply, imagine your life
depending on a transfusion and
there simply being ,no blood
available to save you.

MAC members will consult with
resident assistants who will sign up
students a month ahead since the
Central Blood Bank, which pro-
cesses the blood, must know how
much equipment to bring.

A Red Cross Safety‘ course,
possibly for credit, may also‘ be
offered next term through MAC
efforts. -

Well, now that you’re in glowing

. health again, you might feel up to

an evening of entertainment.

The Student Programming Com-
mittee periodically features a wide
variety of quality entertainment,
most often of a musical nature,
though in the past guests like
Hubert H. Humphrey, and Erich
von /Daniken, have made appear-
ances as well.

According to Gary Kaboly, co-
chairman of the Programming
Committee: “Last year we took
suggestions from students but it
really didn’t work too well. Only a
small percentage responded, and
they often made impossible re-
quests for popular bands touring in
other parts of the world. Besides,
in View of the high attendance at
subsequent concerts, people ob-
viously havefaith in who we pick,”
said Paul van -Haute,. another
Programming co-chairman.

The coffee house circuit is where a
lot of big name performers got their
breaks, but due to the unavailabil-
ity of the Student Union Lounge
this year for these types of concerts
they have temporarily been sus-
pended. The Hunt and Pine rooms
should be renovated and ready to
book concerts later this year.

The events sponsored by the
Prgramming Committee range
in price from free to a maximum of
$2.50, and this money is invested in
future concerts.

Bantam [paper.], 151 pp., $1.65

Considering the unusually distinct
periods into which the life of.
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is broken,
there are various angles from
which one may research the Nobel
1aureate’s biography."

The most basic approach would be
to study his life as a whole, from
beginning to the "present day;

attanother biographer might center on

Solzhenitsyn’s years as a prisoner
and exile from his native province.
The years in the author’s life that
Zhores Medvedev concerns himself
with are those years that have been
the most crucial for Solzhenitsyn:
the ten-year span beginning with
the publication of his premiere
work, One Day in the Life of Ivan

u-q,.mDenisovich, and ending with the

publication of his consummate
achievement, The Gulag Archipe-

fellow exile of Solzhenitsyn, gives a
detailed account of an obscure
writer’s quest to publish what he

upward-bound artists often serve
as readings in inspiration, but
because of .Solzhenitsyn’s addi-
tional historic significance, Me-
dvedev is able to go far beyond
that.

He takes the reader slowly up the
steps ofSolzhenitsyn’s calvary and
he makes the reader bear the
visionary’s cross at each station:
the illegal confiscation of Solzhen-
itsyn’s second novel, The First
Circle; the black market entre-
preneurs who, with the covert aid
of the Soviet government, pirate
phony versions of the author’s
works in foreign countries in order
to discredit him; the politically
ﬁnanced look-alikes who display
incriminating behavior in public so-
that the press may seize upon such
“exposes” and show what a moral
“fraud”’ Solzhenitsyn really is-

But Medvedev does not neglect to
share the few intense joys either.
He focuses particular attention on
Solzhenitsyn’s 1973 Nobel Prize for
Literature, and reprints a sizable
piece of the writer’s intended
Nobel lecture. Though the address
was never given, its words, even
unspoken, contain such tremen-
dous force that they are the most
eloquent phrases this literary giant
has yet created. A ,

Medvedev is a scientist. His
writings almost always involve
scientiﬁc questions. His literary
depiction in this biography, there-
fore, is not that colorful, and when
a book is translated from Russian
into -English the dry becomes
drier. '

But there is no disputing
Medvedev’s information.- He
admires his courageous friend
enough to do Solzhenitsyn’s

movement justice: “Ten years ago’.

the author of Ivan Denisovicih made
his sudden, triumphant debut, and
it was the triumph of truth. The

enthusiasm with which. the new‘

writer was first greeted was not

just an expression of" delight at _

contact with genuine art...it was
delight that art could conquer
violence and the life.”

Not one of Solzhenitsyn’s mon-

given little mention in Medvedev’s
literary history, Candle iii the Wind
is a gripping drama that focuses on

‘mankind’s shaky defense against
the forces of government and-

technology.

Copyrighted in 1960, but pu-
blished in this edition only
recently, the play has an Orwellian

theme, even without jumping to a

futuristic time. Solzhenitsyn
creates a contemporary ‘setting in

Of a Russian Composer

and in English translation. without
which a full appreciation of the
world would not be possible.

The Fifth Symphony is a solid
piece of music which shows a
striking number of characteristics
of much older compositions of
earlier, more formal composers.
Its form is restrained, and closer to
the classical symphonic design, yet
it is a modernistic piece--certainly
not reactionary.

During the writing of the Fifth
Symphony, Stalin’s latest exten-
sion of the “five-year plan” was
dismally going down the drain.
The economy was in a hell of a
mess, ‘and everybody knew it.
Naturally, the governmental bur-
eaucrats frantically insisted that all
the arts portray only the good--the

- image of the archetypical Soviet

Man Triumphant, mastering the
elements and the enemies of the
people, stfiding conﬁdently for-
ward into the rosy future. The
Fifth does this, but with style!

On the other hand, the “Thir-
teeneth,” a much more recent
work, shows a completely different
mood. It uses Yevtushenko’s
poems of. social protest as a
springboard for powerful, tortuous,
almost grotesque music.

The poem from which the
symphony gets its title is named
“Babi Yar,” after a location where

Dorsett
vs.
  Davis?

BY BART MACK
_ ‘SPORTS EDITOR

Tony Dorsett versus Anthony Davis? '
Hardly. Don’t even.let the thought enter your mind. . .
It's no secret that both Dorsett and Davis will very likely be breaking

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

 

rushing record with 24 yards and Davis to break total points and career
touchdowns held by 0. J. Simpson with a touchdown, but it will take
more than one man on either side to wrap up any kind of a victory.

Even after Southern Cal’s opening loss to Arkansas, the Trojans are
not to be taken lightly. USC coach John McKay put it very plainly.

“We passed poorly, caught poorly, tackled poorly, blocked poorly and
coached poorly. Other than that it was a perfect day.”

The Trojans set up all 22 of the Razorbacks’ points via turnovers and a
general breakdown of executions on both units. To me, that doesn't
sound like a team that was given the nod by some” football

Cgpsplgnosticators to take the national championship.

w ith a week off to regroup and recouperate, youcan bet that McKay
will be opening the season all over again tomorrow at Pitt Stadium.
Despite the fact Pitt is ranked higher, USC was still made the favorite
by anywhere from three to 13 points.

That result can be derived from the mere facts in black and white--On
paper, the Trojans simply outclass the Panthers. ’

“There is no way we can physically match Southern Cal man for
man,” an every cautious Johnny Majors humbly stated, “We will
need a superior effort from every man on our squad.”

One factor that has darkened the Pitt picture in the past few days was
the appearance of both center Mike Carey and middle guard Gary
Burley traversing the practice field on Wednesday only with the aid of
crutches. Ankle injuries to both, and with Burley it was the same ankle
that required the removal of a bone spur over the summer.

Whetherornot both will start has been tabbed “doubtful? by Majors,

A but I’m confident that both will be ready for the opening kickoff quite '

is near 100% sound. -

HI?"

' I remember two years ago, Pitt was heading into a basketball game

against a supposedly NIT bound Penn State team with Billy Knight
boarding the team bus Friday evening on crutches. Knight, with his
knee wrapped at game time, barely looked strong enough-to sprint
' during warmups, but hit for 28 points to lead Buzz Ridl tc; one of the
most satisfying wins of the season. '

Coaches will tell you that the ﬁne art of turning bleak situations like
the pair heretofore mentioned is “getting the most\out of your
players.”. It can work two ways--by taking a dynamic individual and,
with some medical help making him forget about the “pain.” The-
other way is to just take a man of not superior talents and psyching him
silly out of his mind. _

The latter is also called making a team play “above their heads.”

Johnny Majors is a master at both. ' '

Granted, the Trojans may have beaten themselves in Little Rock but .

the 60,000 plus Razorback fans and the super-psyched Arkansas team
' ve to be given a little bit of credit for not handing the game right
ack to USC, right? I '

Exactly. Bill. Currie, in another one of his brilliant commentaries
before the Steeler-Broncos game, said that it didn't make one bit of
never-mind where the game was being played. When a team has the
powers to trounce another, it won't matter where they play.

Those of you that have been Pitt
football fans for more than a couple
of years should be able to remem-
ber the days when the Pitt team
was little more than a joke. In a
nine year span from 1964 to 1972,
the Pantherswon only 22 games
while losing 68. and coming up even
in two others. Four of those years
turned out to be one-win seasons,
and even the most fanatic Pitt fan
was left with a sickening feeling in
his stomach.

But the Panthers are no longer
anybody’s patsy going into tomor-
row’s game against Southern Cali-
fornia with a 2-0 record after
compiling their first winning record
in ten seasons one year ago. In the
immeidate past, the Trojans would
probably have been favored by at
least three touchdown and Pitt fans
would beforeed to suffer through

' an afternoon of ‘Panther Follies.’

However, the point spread for
tomorrow’s contestonly has USC
picked by apporximately one touch-
down, and the near capacity crowd

the Panthers put up a ﬁerce

struggle that would even make‘ K

Jock Sutherland proud.

Then again, it could turn out to be
a rout. Nobody really knows what
USC is capable of after Arkansas
upset the Trojans in their only
game of the season. One thing is
for sure, USC will be theitoughest
team Pitt has faced this season,
loaded with outstanding players
and hungry for their first win.

The USC offense will center
around the running of Anthony
Davis and the passing of Pat
Haden. Anybody who follows
college football knows about Davis,
the quick little tailback (5-9, 183)
who gained over 1000 yards in both
his sophomore and junior seasons.

Should Davis score a touchdown
against the Panthers, he will add
two more USC records ‘to his
already outstanding credentials.
Davis needs just four poin-ts to
become the leading scorer in
Trojan histroy and a touchdown will
tie"him is O.J. Simpson for most
touchdowns by a USC player.

Last’ season, USC coach John
McKay called Haden “the greatest
passer I‘VE EVER SEEN.“ But
against Arkansas Haden completed

‘just six of his 18 tosses while

throwing four interceptions. Never-
theless, coach Johnny Majors ex-
pects Haden to bounce back and
give the Panther defensive second-
ary their stiffest test of the season.
"I ‘don't think there's a better
quarterback in the country throw-
ing the ball than Haden," said
Majors. “Our secondary will need‘
good downfield coverage because

Booters-Edinboro  

In Crucial Game

BY JIM SPANOS\

In what can only be described as
an extremely crucial game, the Pitt
Soccer team faces the Edinboro
Scots tomorrow, at Edinboro. Last
year the tiny college in northern
Pennsylvania beat the Panthers
S-0, and that in itself should be all
the motivation Pitt will need. I

The Cats have only managed six
goals in their first three outings,
and this problem has prompted
Coach Leo Bemis to invoke a new
formation against Edinboro.

-“We're going to a four man

front,” Bemis said, “in order to

utilize our manpower better. We
have to improve our defense as well
as our offense. With the exception
of Tom Murphy our players didn't
use the three man front line in high
school."

Joe Luxbacher, Bemis’ assistant
coach, said, “Our halfbacks were
playing too much defense with the
three man front line. We've been
running drills in which the defense
‘passes the ball to the forwards.

‘ O.ur halfbacks have to control the

center of the field and link the
offense and the defense.”

In last Saturday’s rout dealt to the
Panthers by West Chesterstate,

the field, but Bemis and Luxbacher
refuse to use the field condition as
an excuse for the loss.

“We're at the point where we

have to work on fu11damentals...,.,.._

We're not going to do a lot of
things differently," noted Bemis.
Luxbacher conveyed the same feel-
ing: "All we need is a wing to get
back some confidence.”

The Edinboro team will be out to
prevent Pitt from obtaining con-
fidence, of course. They were
defeated by Lockhaven in their
opening game of the season, by a
3-0 score. — They also played
Gannon in their second game on
Wednesday evening. Edinboro will
short for another “upset,"‘but the
Panthers haven't forgotten last
year's game, and they'll be trying
for a convincing win: I

‘'1 really don't know what hap-
pened to us in last yéar’s"'game,"
said Luxbacher of last year's
shutout. “It was just one of those
days that we didn't have it. We'll

have to see if we can turn things

around on Saturday. The team is in
good physical condition right
now."

laughable nor sacreligious, and

.head coach Chuck Noll, for one, is

concerned about Sunday’s game
with the Oakland Raiders at Three
Rivers Stadium.

“We made a couple mistakes to
set them up,” Noll said, “but I
can’t be pleased when the defense
gives up 35 points. They put
together some good, strong
drives.”

Instrumental in those drives were
passes by ‘quarterback Charley
Johnson and replacement Steve
Ramsey to backs -coming out of the I
backﬁeld. Otis Armstrong and
Floyd Little combined for six

receptions, 104 yards and two
touchdowns.

But Noll refused to blame his
linebackers’ pass defense: “It was
mainly just great running by their
backsvafter they caught the ball. Of
course, we miss Henry Davis, but
Jack Lambert is doing well. He’s
gonna be a fine football player.”

Denver’s rushing attack hardly
faltered either as Armstrong
gained 131 yards on just 19
carriers. -

And if Denver’s offense was good,
Oakland’s will likel.y be better. The
interior line makes it go: center
Jim Otto, guards Gene Upshaw and
George Buehler, and tackles Art
Shell .and John Vella form about the

toughest unit in the league on both
runs and passes.

They were firing off the snap last
year, and led the Raider offense to
an average 378.5 yards in two
meetings with Pittsburgh. They
also controlled the ball, running an
average 78 plays to the Steelers’
51. If they accomplish the same
this time, it should mean victory.

“They ran it right down our’
throats last year,” Noll said. “I
don’t want to be specific too early,
but we’ll do a lot of things
differently on defense this time-- 
anything we think will screw theritgﬁwp

"1 BY STEVE SYBERT

For center Mike Carey and the
rest of the offensive line, last
weekend’s 27-17 victory over the
Ramblin‘ Wreck can be considered
the turning point of the season.
Only the second game of the
season, sure, but in the eyes of
Carey, one of the few veterans in
the offensive trenches, a young,
green line suddenly came of age.

Carey, a senior from Warrington,
PA, is the nucleus of the Panther
offensive line where the work is
aplenty but the glory is not.

(Continued from Page 10)

Oakland has a reputation as ‘a
bone-crushing ground offense, but
so far this year they have had the
closest run-pass balance. in the
NFL. They show abundant talent
at all the skill positions: Marv
Hubbard rushed for 903 yards,
Fred Biletnikoff caught 48 passes
for 660 and Mike SianiV45 for 742,
and Ken Stabler led the AFC in
passing, completing 62.72 in 1973.

They showed the kind of run-pass
balance against the Steelers. last

ear, and Noll expects more of the ‘

}ame: “They’ll go back to the
same things that’ve worked so well
against our club in the past.”

The Steeler defense’s reputation
was earned in more than one great
game. It’ll take more than one poor
one to destroy it, too and there’s no
team the Steeler would rather
reassert themselves against that
Oakland.

"My job is the most important on
the offensive line," Carey remark-
ed. “The runner is usually close to
the center."

There is no doubt that Carey does
hisjob,‘ he plays almost unnoticed,
as is the nature of his position, but
still gets satisfaction.

“Most offensive linemen don’t
get in the limelight,” explained
Carey. “What satisfied me is a pat
on the back by Dorsett, Daniels, or
Murphy.” g

The line as a whole has come a

Illustrated cover-man Joe Gilliam.
Another magazine, Pro Football
weekly, registered Denver coach
John Ralston’s high praise of the
Steeler QB: “That might've.been
the greatest performance by a
quarterback I’ve ever seen.”

Jefferson Street Joe completedf3l
of 50, passes for 348 yards in the
NFL’s first regular-season over-
time game. “You’ve got to be in
awe of his arm, but what really
impressed me was the poise that he
showed,” Ralston said.

Gilliam currently leads the NFL--
easily--in attempts with 81, in
completions with 48, and in yards
gained with 605, and the Steelers

-lead the league in total offense with ‘

438 yardsiper game. “But stats
don’t mean a thing,” Gilliam says.

As cool off the field as on, Gilliam
accepts the SI cover story matter-
of-factly. “It’s not that great a
thrill,”~he said, “and I didn’t like

i the article itself much. Theonly

thing that was great was that my
mom and dad .and wife and family

 

 

 

long way. A skeptical Coach
Johnny Majors said before the
season, "1 don't know what this
year's kids will do. I'm not
overawed by our offensive line by a
long shot."

After a shoddy performance a-

gainst Florida State, the line came
around to open big holes against
Georgia Tech and sprang Tony
Dorsett free for 168 yards rushing.
“We were the big workers on the

team,” said Carey. “Coach Joe
Avezzano (offensive line coach)

 Steelers Battle Raiders

got a big kick out of it.”

Against Oakland, Gilliam will face
one ‘of the NFL’s top defensive
backfields. Ageless Willie Brown
and George Atkinson are -crafty
veterans, Jack Tatum hits as
viciously as most defenders 40
pounds heavier, and competition
between Alonzo Thomas and
Nemiah Wilson has apparently
brought out the bestrin them both.

“It’ll be a real challenge for our
offense,” said Gilliam,_who doesn't
know exactly how his urfit will try, to
move the ball. “It’ll depend on
how they play us. I don’t care how
good they are, they can’t cover
everything. Nobody can. So we'll
just take what they give us.”

 

really worked us. We’ve really
improved as we showed last week.
The more we play together, the
better we’re going to get.

"ltytook a while to get used to
each other," he said. “Each game
we'll get closer and be able to pla
better together."

It will be up to Carey as the leader
of the offensive line to keep it
hustling and functioning as a
hard-working unit.

“The sophomores and juniors on .

the line look up to me for confi-
dence and reassurance,” Carey
said. “When you’re young you
make a lot of mistakes. I just tell
them to keep working.

“We feel we have worked hard
during the week so we go out there
Saturday and have fun," explained
Carey. “The atmosphere is very
loose on our football team. We try
to have fun on weekends."

Although he intends to have fun,
