First female provost prepped for new post

Michael Macagnone l Assistant News’Edit.or

Patricia Beeson moved about 30 feet from
her old oﬂice, where she served as vice pro-
vost for both graduate and undergraduate
studies, to her new one as Pitt’s full provost
and senior vice chancellor on Aug. 15.

Beeson is Pitt’s ﬁrst female provost. She
replaced former provost James V. Maher,
who retired to a faculty position in Pitt’s
physics department.

“I think it will be a huge move,” Beeson
said in the beginning of August. “Not so

much because of the hard stuff, like moving .

boxes. It will be the additional responsibil-
ity.”

Beeson worked at Pitt for 27 years before
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg named her to
the provost position". Before joining the Pitt
community, she earned her doctorate from
the University of Oregon, ﬁrst as an assistant
professor of economics, then as associate
and ﬁnally full professor in 2000.

She became an associate dean of the
School of Arts and Sciences in 2001, and
Maher named her the vice provost for gradu-
ate studies in 2004. .

Before moving into Pitt’s administration,
she balanced a schedule of research and
teaching, similar to many on Pitt’s faculty.

Mark Sniderman, the executive vice pres-

ident and chief policy officer at the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, conducted sev-
eral years of research with Beeson during the
’9oVs, focusing on mortgage denial rates.

He ﬁrst met Beeson “way, way back in the
distant past. Possibly in the ’80s,” and has
enjoyed working with her since.

Over the course of several years, Beeson,
Sniderman and Robert Avery, a reserch
economist in the federal reserve system,
published more than half a dozen articles
examining various factors that affect mort-
gage denial rates.

“She was very creative and very ﬂexible
in her thinking,” Sniderman said. “She likes
to think about problems from all different
angles.”

Beeson excelled at analyzing and making

. sense of large amounts of data, he said, a

skill that will help her perform well in the
top tier of Pitt’s administration.
Taking a break from research to teach

. “several University courses provided an op-

portunity for her to see things from a new
perspective. -

When Beeson taught courses in econom-
ics, she would explain subjects to her class
that previously seemed obvious to her, and
when the students asked questions it forced

her to re-think many points. .

She brought that type of multi-direction-
al thinking to her research, an approach that
allowed her to see problems from different
perspectives.

During her time as a member of Pitt’s
faculty she found that the whole process
can be a rich personal experience.

“When you are teaching or doing your
research, it is your activity,” Beeson said.
“The results are very intimate and imme-
diate.”

~ l “Rather than teaching
the class, you are setting
up‘ an atmosphere in
which faculty can teach A

their classes” A .
-- Patricia Beeson I T

For an administrator, the day-to-day
work has a different feel.
“Rather than teaching the class, you are

setting up an atmosphere in which faculty‘
can teach their classes,” she said. “You have _7

:4

  

to develop an atmosphere in which faculty
can excel in their research, rather than doing
‘the research yourself.”_ .

Her day-to-day activities typically go
like this: “Come in, look at the calendar, see
what meetings I have scheduled.”

And along with that, her schedule has
become more regimented since she became
an administrator. She said her job deﬁnitely
has more aspects of management than a
faculty position does-. '

“I’m making it sound like there are a lot
of meetings, and there are a lot of meetings.
I spend a lot of my time working with people,
but they are productive meetings,” she said.
“We actually get a lot of work done.”

She said that the past several years work-
ing in administratiorrhave given her experi-
ence in how the provost’s office works on a
daily basis.

That work with Maher gave her knowl-
edge of each schools and each department’s
progress and goals, which she said was likely
among the reasons Nordenberg choose her
as the next provost;

And when asked in the ﬁrst week of Au-
gust about the provost’smworkload:

‘ ,,.She laughed and said, “Yes, I’m getting

asense of that.’_’ I

Tuition rises for
undergrads at all campuses

Michael M_acagnone I Assistant News Editor

Pitt’s tuition increased this summer, and
so did the University’s salary pool.

Pitt’s Board ofTrustees approved a tu-
ition increase across all campuses, ranging
from 2.5 to 5.5 percent. The board also ap-
proved a $25 increase in Pitt’s computer and
network service fee, and raised the salary
pool for Pitt employees by 3 percent after
a year-long salary freeze. 4

The board cited increasing costs, stag-
nating investments and ﬂat-lining state

‘appropriations as the principle reasons

for raising tuition. t

Arthur‘ Ramicone, the vice chancellor " '

for budget and controller, said “the Uni-
versity cannot move forward by just cut-

ting costs” during the, Budget Committee _

meeting, at which members approved the
tuition increase. ’
Students at Pitt’s regional campuses will

have tuition increased 2.5 percent. For in-

state students, that’s an increase of about
$200 to $300, depending on their major.
For out—of—state students, prices will climb
about $500 to $600. ,

In—state students’. at Pitt-,’s main campus
will see the biggest percent tuition jump
this fall at 5.5 percent, about $600, from
$13,344 to $14,076. Out-of-state student
tuition goes up 3 percent, about $700, to
$23,732.

The most expensive .undergraduate
programs will be in the School of Nursing
and the School of Health and Rehabilita-
tion Sciences. Both will cost $17,720 for
in—state students and $30,162 for out—of-
state students. 1

Effective this fall, the computer and

"network service fee will increase by $25

to $175 for full-time students and $100 for
part-time students. 3 .

The per—semester fee, since its last in-
crease in 2006, was $150 for full-time stu-
dents and $75‘for part-time students.

As in the past, money generated by
the fee will pay for things like the main-
tenance of Pitt’s network infrastructure,
wireless network, student computing labs,
low-cost software for students and e—mail
services. 4 5 -

. The written proposal to the committee
cited network security and student software
cost increases of more than $1.3 million
annually that needed to be addressed. The
fee increase will bring‘Pitt an additional
$1.5 million per year from its more than
34,000 students.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg cited the
record number of applications the Univer-
sity received this past year to demonstrate
that students still view the University as a
high-value institution ‘and worth the ex-
pense. 6 A

Nordenberg said the University hopes
the tuition increase would “strike the best
possible balance” between cutting costs and
increasing the University’s revenue, and
would be “moderate in the marketplace.”

Pitt’s state appropriations, which have
increased by about $20 million overall since
2000, were cited as a large factor in the
decision to raise tuition. Pitt’s operating
budget has grown by more than $500 mil-
lion in that time.

.. " “As thejjlelvel of"st‘ate ‘
support goes down, the
level of tuition inevitably

goes up” .
A --Mark Nordenberg

  

“As the level of state support goes down,
the level of tuition inevitably goes up,” Nor-
denberg said. '

Part of the University’s $1.8 billion bud-
get will include a $6 million increase inthe
ﬁnancial aid. budget, which Ramicone said
was meant to reflect tuition increases.

The increases in the ﬁnancial aid budget
take shape in a mixture of need-based and
merit-based aid opportunities, Ramicone
said.

At the same meeting the board approved
a 3 percent salary increase for Universi-
ty employees, ending a year-long salary
freeze. V,

Ramicone said the University could not
maintain a salary freeze without losing key
staff to competing institutions.

Nordenberg said the University has yet
to see “out of the ordinary” staff losses.
He called the salary increase. “one of our
highest priorities in this budget.”

Research revenue, which represents
more than four times the state appropria-
tion for Pitt, is projected to rise again this
year, forming the largest portion of revenue
for the University at about $750 million.

The increase in research revenue, which
N ordenberg called “nothing short of stun-
ning,” came when Pitt’s endowment lost a
large portion of its value and fewer donors
than normal have helped the University.

The board approved a number of capital
projects, which include construction in
Benedum, Parran and Crabtree halls, as
well as in the Concordia Club and Barco
Law School. '

The $182 million capital budget would
help create jobs in the Pittsburgh region,
Ramicone said. ’ I A

“This is a very good news budget in
terms of the region,” he said. I ’

Pitt’s Honors College gets a new dean

Marissa Meredyth I Staff Writer

“Diet cherry cola— the official drinkofEcon
o5oo.” V

Ifyou’ve heard a phrase like this, most likely
you’ve taken aneconomics course taughtbysteve
Husted, professor of economics at Pitt.

Husted has a new position now, after tak-
ing ofﬁce Aug. 1 as the new interim dean of the
Honors College, though he still has his unique
sense of humor.

The recent appointment makes him only the
second clean the college has seen, appointed af-
ter Glenn Alexander “Doc” Stewart — founder
and ﬁrst dean of the Honor’s College — died
April 7-

“Alec always encouraged students to develop
their minds,” Husted said. “That’s something I’d
like to continue.”

Scott McEvoy, aPitt senior economics major,
met Stewarthisfreshmanyear. He described Hus-
ted’s predecessor with respect and admiration.

“He was my Honors College physics profes-
sor. He never followed a book but was like an
encyclopedia of lmowledge. It was like turning
on afaucet of information. His tests were irnpos—
sible,” McEvoy said. '

“But he always was there to help students
out. A leading nuclear physicist who worked
with the likes of Nobel Prize-winner Richard
Feynman, would still sit down with freshman
students for hours to explain simple mechanics.
When Husted steps in, he’ll have big shoes to ﬁll,”

McENoy said.

Over the summer, Husted spent a month in
Arizona with his wife, enjoying some time off
to golf. He recently returned from Hong Kong,
where he attended an economic conference.
While in China, he also visited Shanghai —where
he taught there 25 years ago —— to meet with a
former graduate student.

Husted began his college education as apoliti-
cal science major at Michigan State University. He

testedoutofalotofclasseshisﬁrstyea1;whichal— »

lowed himto ﬁnish the requirements ofhis major
early. Because Husted needed more classes, his
adviser suggested he take economics courses.

“Theywere hard atﬁrst. I didn’t dothat great,”
Husted said. , .

Despite their difficulty, the courses piqued
Husted’s interest, and he continued to take al-
mostall economics courses his senior year before

’ deciding to continue studying economics after

graduating. _
His specialization in international economics

I camefromdevelopingrelationshipswithhis early

economics professors and his interest in their
research at the time. _

Since 1986, Husted has taught in Pitt’s eco-
nornics department. From 1999 to 2005, he
served as dean of graduate research.

He will continue to teach while serving as
dean,‘ instructing an upper-level international
economics course in the fall and his honors in-

troductory macroeconomics course inthe spring,
both of which he designed.
“I’ve been here a long time and have really
developedanappreciation forhowgreatthis Uni-
_ versity is, especially through the opportunities it
provides to students,” Husted said. “My visionfor
the Honors College is aplace thattries to encour-
age and promote intellectual curiosity.”
In acouple weeks, the Honors Collegewill go

l-Ett professor-turned-interim-dean
Steve Husted poses in early Auguil

on a retreat, and one of Husted’s ﬁrst goals is to
drill into students the importance of getting to
know a new professor each semester.

“I’m.really good at remembering faces,” he
said. ,“I_ knew yours the moment you walked in.
Names I often don’t remember, unless they come
to my ofﬁce hours.”

Husted said he sees professors as a great re-
source for students, whether they give extrahelp
for a class, write recommendation letters or just
chat about life. '

“But students have to take the ﬁrst step and
walk into the office,” he said.

Husted said going in panicking around exam
time doesn’t count. He said he never has stu-
dents go into his ofﬁce just to talk, but that they
should. — .

James Maloy, alecturer who works in Pitt’s

, economics department with Husted, said, “The

Honors College has found an outstanding candi-

of replacing “Doc” Stewart. Husted has always
been dedicated to both the Honors College and
the University community as a whole — from
instructing courses to helping students achieve
their ﬁill potential both inside and outside the
classroom.” _

Speaking on behalfof the economics depart-
ment, Maloy said it is extremely pleased Husted
hasbeengiventhis opportunity, “while admitting
that his daily presence will be sorely missed.” I

The man responsible for making sure
6,500 students have ajhappy, healthy, safe
andproductive living experience on cam-
pus is just a kid at heart.

Since Shawn Brooks became the direc-
tor of Residence Life ﬁve years ago, his co-
workers and employees have been amazed
by his energetic persona on the job.

Rosey Natale, an administrative as-
sistant in the Residence Life office, said
Brooks clearly cares about every stu-
dent.

“He likes to get to know people and
really cares about an individual. He’ll sit
down and talk with you about anything,

an opinion,” Natale said.

Brooks’ path to Pitt began with an un-
dergraduate degree from Thiel College. He
earned his master’s in counselor education
with a focus in -student affairs at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania and his Ph.D.
in higher education and organizational
change at UCLA. —

‘ Before landing in Oakland, Brooks
worked at Georgia Tech as a residence
hall complex coordinator.

 

V’ “He’s inspiring in that

 sense. If you have a
passion, he_helps to
promote you” i

-- Rosemary Natale ’ -E

  

As the director of Residence Life, Brooks
is responsible for organizing programs and
services to entertain the more than 6,500
students living in residence halls.

Some of these programs include Living
Learning Communities, First Year Expe-
rience and the First Year Cup, designed
to foster freshmen’s relationships with

munity. , .

To make sure the residential facilities
meet all students’ needs, Brooks works
with Panther Central and Housing Services
to ensure everything runs smoothly. He
also serves as one of two residential ju-
dicial officers, overseeing the day-to—day
operations of the student conduct process
within residence halls.

Brooks said the chances any particular
student will have to meet him are pretty
slim. He said the resident assistants and
resident directors are the people residents
should know, he wants students to be able

.to communicate with him if they want or
need.

Natale said that although he is young
at heart, Brooks is the type of person who
truly cares about individuals and what
makes them happy. A

“He’s inspiring in that sense. If you have
a passion, he helps to promote you,” Na-
tale said.

It. is this care for students that has led
Brooks to institute new initiatives for the
2010-11 school year.

One of the main changes this upcom- _

ing school year is the implementation of
Freshmen Interest Groups in Lothrop Hall.
They are designed to make the dorm more
appealing. / "

With its single rooms and distance from
campus, Lothrop Hall can sometimes make

it difficultvfor students to form relation— '

ships, Brooks said. Freshmen Interest
Groups will bring together freshman stu-
dents with common interests.

Each group will fill a ﬂoor. Pilot groups
include Exploration of the Arts, Service to
Others, Leadership Development, Interna-
tional Issues, Healthy Living and Sports
Life. The programs will consist of about
30 students who participate in structured
programming and seminars built around a
common theme, "according to the Student
Affairs website.

The main goal of these floors is to help
freshmen in Lothrop develop a sense of
community and pull them out of their
single rooms, Brooks said.

In addition toithe Freshmen Interest
Groups, Lothrop will have a ﬁrst—year Liv-
ing Learning Community for freshmen
interested in medicine. Another Living
Learning Community is being introduced
to upperclassmen interested in studying
law. _

Brooks also helps operate Pitt’s Out-
side the Classroom Curriculum. Because
students spend 804 percent of their time
outside the classroom, Brooks continually
looks for ways to ensure that learning is
brought out of the classroom and into the
residence halls. He said employers and
graduate schools do not just look for the
4.0 GPA student.

“I want to develop programming that
will help students become more than just
a walking, talking intellect,” Brooks said.
“Employers and graduate schools are look-
ing for the education of the whole student
and how they are developing themselves
as a citizen of the world.”

Brooks’ personality helps him give
students the best residential experience.
He said it is both his patience and sense
of humor that help him get through each
day.  I l

Bike safety: more than wearing helmet

john Manganaro I Assistant News Editor

“I call it zoning. I quiet all the noise in
my head and focus on all the things going
on around me. Total focus.” .

That’s how bicycle safety advocate and
Bike Pittsburgh employee Lou Fineberg
describes the high he gets while riding a
bike. He says “zoning” is an-easy feeling to
achieve in the Steel City, whether barreling
down Grant Street or coasting on Schenley
Drive near Flagstaff Hill.

“We have an emerging bike community

that is changing the whole culture of Pitts-
burgh,” Fineberg said. “We’re saving energy
and really just enjoying the road.”

Thousands of other Pittsburghers share
Fineberg’s two—wheeled infatuation. But, as
with every high, there comes a low: More
than 700 bicyclists died on U.S. roads in
2008, and 52,000 more were injured, ac-
cording to the National Highway Traﬂic
Safety Administration. _

Oakland faced its own bicycle-related

)1

t Upstairs-

tragedy last year, when a driver of a Ford
pickup truck struck and killed a cyclist at the
intersection of Meyran Avenue and Louisa
Street. . '

Today a white “ghost bike” is chained
to a telephone pole on the corner to com-
memorate the life of former Oakland resi-
dent Ruihui Lin who died in the accident. For
riders like Fineberg, the specter cycle serves
as a poignant reminder that bike safety is a
prevalent Pittsburgh issue.

The dos and do nots

Not six blocks from the intersection of
Meyran Avenue and Louisa Street stands
Iron City Bikes, one of Oakland’s few full-

‘ service bike maintenance shops.

There is nothing casual about Iron City
Bikes or the four or ﬁve bearded, tattooed
men who run it. Inside the shop the walls
are lined with locks, chains, pumps and fully
assembled cycles. A brown-and—white pit
bull roams the tiny space, stepping around
the guts of bicycles and the tools used to
ﬁx them.

“Never ride on the sidewalk, and always,
always carry U-lock,” said Luke Mitchell
from behind the counter one afternoon
during July’s record—breaking heat wave.

_ An avid cyclist who commutes daily from

his South Side home to Oakland, he tries to
push safety tips on every customer.

“And if you’re riding at night, you better
have lights, and you better not be drunk,”
Mitchell said. “If you get into an accident
at night without carrying lights, even, if the

' accident is someone else’s fault, it’s still your

fault legally. It’s commonsense.”

From his own office across town,
Fineberg, too, discussed bike safety while
dodging the July heat. He thinks the most
dangerous mistakes riders make in Oak-
land are, unfortunately, also the most com-
mon. 1

“It is not at all safer to ride on the side-
walk than it is to ride on the road,” Fineberg
said. “That’s a big misconception. You need
to be on the side of the road for motorists
to clearly see.” 1 ‘

The dangers of sidewalk riding include
the obvious: pedestrians, curbs, crosswalks,
blind corners and a myriad of other obj ects.
But there are other dangers as well, includ-
ing broken glass, street signs, lamp posts
and parking meters.

“Almost every accident you‘ hear of in
town involves a rider mounting or dismount-
ing the sidewalk, ﬂying out from behind a
parked car or falling into the road while
dodging a pedestrian,” Fineberg said. “We
can’t protect bad cyclists.” I .

Fineberg’s last piece of advice is_so obvi-
ous that he sometimes forgets to mention

‘ it: “Wear a damn helmet.”

Saferiders 1

, More than 53,000 cyclists have died in
traffic crashes in the United States since
1932 — the ﬁrst year in which estimates
of bike fatalities were recorded. Since that
time,*the NHTSA estimates that cyclist

deaths have accounted for about 2 percent g
I of all traffic fatalities. 1

According to PennDOT, 16 bicyclists lost

C their lives in Pennsylvania last year, includ-
r ing four youths younger than 18.

Bus routes overhauled over summer

Leena Ketkar I Staff Writer

Students and commuters in Oakland
might have to wait longer or pay more at
city bus stops this fall.

This summer the Port Authority altered
route services as part of its 2009 Transit De—
velopment Plan. ,

Port Authority officials stressed that the
service changes enacted this summer were
not a result of the $47 million-budget shortfall
projected for next year. - - ,

The budget shortfall was because of a va-
riety of factors, including the rising cost of
fuel and the failure of Act 44, a Pennsylva-
nia legislation intended to provide funding
for transportation, Heather Pharo, a Port
Authority spokeswoman, said. The Act 44
funding was not keeping up the pace with
the rising inﬂation. ' r

The $330 million 2010-11 budget will
likely cause its own major shuffling and re-

duction of service, with a number of cuts
slated for next year.

. The original Transit Development Plan
was implemented in order to update the route
system, Pharo said.

“Some routes had not been changed since
the 1960s, and, of course, Allegheny Coun-
ty has,” she said. “A change was needed to
maintain efliciency and reﬂect the changing
demographics and commuting patterns of

   

 
 

residents.”

Oakland represents the second largest
employment area in Allegheny County and
enjoys one of the highest levels of service
currently, Pharo said.

“We recognize how important service in
Oakland is, and that’s something we took
into account when planning these efficiency
changes and route changes,” Pharo said.

A noticeable change to Oakland students
is the fragmentation of the 59U, a bus that
once ran from the Waterfront to South Side
Works, passing through Oakland and Squirrel
Hill. It has been split into the 75, which runs
from Bakery Square in East Liberty to the
South Side Works, and the 61D, which now
has service through the Waterfront.

Allegheny County towns and Pittsburgh
neighborhoods might experience a 35 per-

‘cent reduction in service and an increase in

cash fares, according to the Port Author-
ity website and the Authority’s most recent

. proposal.

“The Board [of Directors] will have to
vote on authorizing these [proposals] in the

fall, and they would take‘ effect in January,”

Pharo said. _
Many bus riders will pay at least 25 cents

. more for each trip, while those on the Port

Authority’s Light Rail'Transit line will pay
$4 each way. -

Pitt student Sidra Chavla, who works
Downtown,‘ said that the new bus routes
increased her commuting time, adding that
the change has forced her to walk farther to
catch a bus back into Oakland.

“The bus stops and buses are always re-
ally crowded, and I usually end up having to

- stand on my way home,” she said.

Students are not the only, nor the most

‘numerous, users of Pittsburgh public trans-

portation. Bloomﬁeld resident Sandy Miller
rides the bus daily," now having to make two
bus changes as a result of the route chang-
es.

“Riding the bus to work is the easiest op-
tion for me,” Miller said, “but I cannot afford
to spend over two hours in commuting time
per day.” 4 ,

Pitt graduate student Carey Kotulski —

who is studying special eduction —— said she ,
‘ has beneﬁted from the changes.

The addition of the 75, according to Kot-
ulski, goes to her two choice neighborhoods:
Shadyside and South Side._

“The changes to the routes are annoying

. because Iwas used to the old routes, but the-

75 is much more efficient,” she said.

Since Pitt has a contract with Port Author-
ity for the transit pass program throughjune
2012, an increase in fares would not imme-
diately affect students and staffon campus.

For an up-to-date list of changes and a
hearing schedule, see the Port’Aut_hori1;y

Pitt adds rules on Weights, recording class  

Augustrzg,» 291.0. mi The »Pitt~Nevv;s,l WWW,.pittneWs..c0m

Michael Macagnone | Assistant News Editor

Pitt students beware: University ad—-

ministration inked a few more rules into
the books this summer. If you dare to
break them, you could face action from
campus security and the University Ju-
dicial Board.

University administration enacted two
new rulesz the ﬁrst bans the practice of
“weight dropping” in campus gyms and

the other bans recording without consent
in classrooms. Both rules were drafted
after administrators faced new situations
with students that put strain on old prac-
tices.

Weight dropping involves lifting a bar-
bell to chest height or above and then
dropping the weight, rather than lower‘-
ing it for another rep. The technique is

considered the safest way to handle heavy
weights in some exercises, particularly
those that involve lifting a barbell above
the head.

The practice was banned after a student
group, Panther CrossFit, damaged the
Belleﬁeld heavy lifting gym by repeatedly
dropping weight. '

The ceiling of the Aerobics Room below

the workout room in Belleﬁeld was dam-
aged, and Marilyn Ross, Pitt’s directorof
intramurals‘ and recreation, quickly ruled
that Pitt didn’t have any venues that could
host weight dropping exercise.

“We don’t have a problem with Cross— .

Fit,” Ross said. “We just don’t have a place
on campus where we can put them. Belle-
field is a very old building. It just can’t
take heavy weight dropping. We’re hop-
ing they might be able to ﬁnd a site near
campus.” W

The Panther CrossFit club started
working out in Belleﬁeld Hall in January
after being moved out of Trees Hall.

Weight dropping could now put‘stu-
dents in front of the University Judicial
Board and could; result in a Pitt police
escort out of workout facilities,

' The recording rule requires professors
to give written permission for students
to record classes, whether through video
or audio. c

“We don’t have aproblem pi 

. with CrossFit. We just
don’t have a place where

we can ‘put them.”
A in ' -—  Ross

The University’s Staff Assembly passed
the rule in response to an incident where
a student videotaped a class and put the
video on«-Youtube —-— along with negative
commentary on the teacher and class.

The video has since been removed
from Youtube. Violating the policy could
put students in front of the Student]udi—
ciary Board, under the policy of creating
a “hostile learning environment” in the
classroom University Senate President
Michael R. Pinsky.said in May.

' The Staff Assembly is affiliated with
the University Senate. Theassembly, Pin-
sky said, actedto, protect the “sanctity of
the classroom” in making students get
written permission from faculty to record
in classes. ’ P j V

The University’s faculty handbook
mentions “creating a hostile work or
learning environment” as part of its anti-
harassment policy. V L ‘

To allow students to record “just be-
cause they want to is quite dangerous” to
the classroom, Pinsky said.

‘5Learning can be too easily bruised or
damaged,” he said. V .

Pinsky said that s_ome faculty were
concerned that recording in classrooms
would affect the class discussion, as stu-
dents might censor themselves if they
knew they were being recorded. I

completion of renovations in Amos Hall last year.

Gwenn Barney I Staff Writer

Vice Provost Kathy Humphrey
made her decision to become apart of
the Pitt community in much the same
way many freshmen choose Pitt.

“I came for a visit and fell in love
with the place,” she said. _

Humphrey, who just celebrated
her ﬁfth year at the University, said
she has only fallen more in love with
the blue and gold school over time.

As both vice provost and dean of
students, Humphrey plays a large
role_ in daily Pitt life. She supervises

1 all University organizations students

work with outside the classroom.

Humphrey has been notably de-
voted to campus diversity. She was
instrumental in the creation of the
cross-cultural leadership community
at Pitt. _

By her measure, most universities
that have similar leadership depart-
ments keep them segregated cultural-
ly, focusing on training leaders within
their own cultural context, instead
of across cultures.. Humphrey has
worked hard to make sure this is not

the case with Pitt’s community.

Most recently, Humphrey has
improved Pitt’s diversity by imple-
menting the “Cultural Assimila-
tion Program.” The program gives
students an opportunity to explore
other cultures through participation
in various ceremonies of other areas
of the world.

Humphrey is known by many for
her energetic demeanor. Director of
Communication for Student Affairs

. Shawn Aheam has enjoyed working

beside the high-spirited provost.

“I love working for her because
she b_rings such tremendous energy
each and every day. Her enthusiasm
is contagious,” he said.

Ahearn particularly remembers
the excitement Humphrey exhibited
during the annual Pitt Make a Differ-
ence Day, one ofher favorite projects.
The ﬁrst Make aDifference Day, when

students gathered to participate in an g

Oakland-wide community service
project, took place onacold and gray

Despite the less-than—ideal
weather, Humphrey brought her
usual excitement to the event. She
rolled up her sleeves and worked
along side students to clean up the
community.

“She’s just like this light on cam-
pus,” Ahearn said.

Humphrey makes apointto spend
as much time with the student popu-
lation as possible.

“I love the students here,” she
said. “In general, they’re bright, en-
gaging and really accepting of one
another.’’.

Once a month, Humphrey hosts
“dean’s hours,” during which she
meets and chats with students over
food andidrinks. At the most recent
dean’s hours this past spring, Hum-
phrey even took her indoor dean’s
hours outside, where she played corn
hole with students.

Before working with students,
Humphrey spent many years as
a student herself. When she was a
child, her parentsmoved to Missouri

Citizen Police Review
Board in spotlight

Michael Macagnone I Assistant News Editor

From the courts to the city council cham-
ber, the Citizens Police Review Board spent
most of this summer in the spotlight.

The Citizens Police Review Board began
investigating claims of police misconduct
directly after its establishment by a city
referendum in 1997. During thattime, the
claims often attracted media and local at-

A tentipon, but this ,summer’s controversy.
involves board members.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl swore in ﬁve new
board members on Aug. 3:»Donna Kramer,
Rev. Eugene Downing ]r., Diana O’Brien'
Martini, Deborah Whitﬁeld and Leshonda
Roberts, ending an almost two-month. long
controversy between the city council, the
mayor’s oflice and the board.

| “This administration has

taken an adverse posi-
tion to the board.” "

-- Doug Shields I A

' Ravenstahl reappointed two board
members: Richard Carrington and Debo-
rah Walker. 4 '

The newest conﬂict began on June 18,

when the CPRB was in court arguing a G-20 '

Summit—related case against the city. At the
highpoint of the related media attention,
Ravenstahl announced that he intended to
replace ﬁve of the seven board members
and reappoint two. ‘

The mayors move angered board mem-
bers and local citizens. Some suspect a con-
nection between the board’s protracted

' court battle over police documents and the
mayor’s decision. Some of the documents
were public records.

Beth Pittinger, executive director of the
board, said that the process of appointing
new board members would be “tainted” by
the mayor’s announcement.

“If [these events] happened in isolation
of each other, it would be a different story,”
she said. i

Initially, the "city’s attorneys claimed that
the CPRB was allowed to investigate only
individual complaints of police misconduct,
and that a general investigation exceeded
the board’s powers. They also argued that
some documents could endanger national
security if released. .

Allegheny County Court judge R. Stanton
Wettick refuted those claims and said that
it was within the power of the CPRB to in-

vestigate police conduct without individual.

complaints. ‘
The board does not have any punitive

r;’.;.:x.i¢‘-I

power. It makes recommendations to the
mayor’s oﬂice and the chief of police’s ofﬁce
concerning police training and tactics.

While this article was being reported,
the city had yet to elaborate on its opposi-
tion of the board’s investigation beyond the
reasons presented at the original trial.

Following Wettick’s decision, the city
providedmorethansoo pages of redacted
documents “covered in black magic mark-
er,” said Pittinger.

Since then, the board has moved that the
city, particularly police chief Nathan Harp-
er, should be held in contempt, because the
documents that the board received did not
satisfy the subpoena.

The board also launched an investiga- T

tion into the individual complaints that it
received in relation to the G-20 Summit.

The court’s latest hearing in relation to
the case was Aug. 20.

City Council also got into the mix in mid-
June, passing a resolution that encouraged
the CPRB to align its request for documents
with those of the pending lawsuits or to
wait until after the statute of limitations
expired. Either solution could long delay
the board’s investigation. »

Both councilmen Bill Peduto and Doug
Shields abstained on the vote, saying that
council had no say in the board’s activi-
ties.

Shields said that city lawyers encour-
aged council to pass the resolution.

Councilman» Patrick Dowd, who voted
for the resolution, said that the document
“suggested that it might be prudent to wait

- for the ‘documents from the federal law-

suits.” ,
But, in relation to documents for the 14
sworn complaints that the board received,

Dowd said “the city should comply in that

matter.” .

Shields was not sure why the city was so
adverse to releasing the documents or why
it tried to use a national security argument
in its defense. . _ »

‘.‘What happened in Oakland that Friday
night had nothing to do with national se-
curity,” Shields said.

The city’s insurance company has kept
a ﬁrm lid on the documents. Members of

_ council — basically the company’s clients,

as the company was hired by the city -

don’t have access tothe documents, Shields

said. ' J
Pitt spokesman John‘ Fedele said that

' Pitt handed over to the city all of its records

related to the G-20 Summit last fall.
“This administration has taken an ad-
verse position to the board,” Shields said,
referring to the mayor’s oﬂice and other
city offices. I

tition.

Philadelphiaboughtsoo solar—pow-

sidewalks in April 2009. The upgrade‘

from 700 standard, wire trash cans to
500 trash compactors translated into
fewer garbage pick—ups, which save on
ﬁiel and labor costs and will save the
city an estimated $13 million over 10
years.

News of the trash compactors’ ﬁ-
nancial and environmental beneﬁts

Pitt pickedup one of these BigBelly so-
lar-powered compactors as ademothis

Pittsburgh’s ﬁrst solar—powered

said Mark Roessler, area sales director
for Waste Management

The BigBelly machines, which are
distributed by Waste Management, can
hold as much as200 gallons of uncom-
pacted trash.

‘ The 250 non—solar receptacles
that Pittsburgh bought last year have
a36-gallon capacity.

Standing at just more than 4 feet
tall, the trash compactors have a
1,2V5o-pound maximum compaction
force, according to a report from the
City of Philadelphia that had many of
the compactor’s speciﬁcations.

There’s a hopper, like those on U.S.
Postal Service maﬂboxes, for safety and
cleanliness. The design also keeps out
pests, keeps inodors and makes dump-
ing residential waste difficult.

For safety reasons, the motor will
only run when the door is closed, but

Pitttaking more steps
to improve OCC  

Gwenn Barney I Staff Writer ‘ '

The OCC is evolving. -

Pitt’s Student Affairs will make several
changes to the Outside the Classroom Curricu-
lum including more marketing, removal of some
of the requirements in the check list and the
introduction of an electronic portfolio.

The electronic portfolio is perhaps the big-
gest of these adjustments, according to a number
ofPitt administrators, as itwill give students the
ability to add video recordings and documents
to their OCC transcripts.

‘ “With the e-portfolio,

students will be able
to clearly demonstrate
their skills”

Students will be able toinput picture and
word ﬁles to the portfolios, as well.

Administrators plan to select 300 students
to pilot the ?‘e—portfolios” this fall.

Vice provost and clean of students Kathy
Humphrey explained that, if a student par-
ticipates in a workshop or hears a well-known
speaker, they can take video or sound record-

ing of such memorable events in their college

careerand sin'iply“drop”tlie'recordingintheir

clearly demonstrate their skills,” she said. V

The OCC program was unveiled in 2007 as
a way for students to keep track of the many
activities in which they participate throughout
their time at Pitt. '

OCC creators estimated that, come gradu-
ation time, students will be hard~pressed to
remember each and every event they took part
in during their undergraduate career.

By keepingtrack ofthese events throughthe
OCC portfolio, students will be_ able to refer back
to descriptions of each event to jogtheir memory
for application and interviews. ‘ «
Students who successfully keep their port-

folios up to date and complete a ‘pre—assigned
number of events are rewarded at graduation
with a certiﬁcate and green cord.

Despite its intentions, the OCC has had its

fair share of road—bumps since its inception.
Though more than 9,000 students are
currently registered with the OCC program,

many students neglect to keep track of their V

OCC credit.

Another common problem is that students
“swipe in” at an event only to immediately
leave. ,

Humphrey said that the program’ is for the
beneﬁt of students, and exploitation by such
tactics as the svvipe—and-run only dilutes a stu-
dent’s individual portfolio. \

“The _OCC is not for the University, it’s for
the student,” she said f‘They’ve not stolen from
anyone but themselves.” , I

_ There are no plans to change the format
of the OCC to curb abuse of the program, but
coordinators do planto add greater incentives
for OCC participation this year. Plarmed incen-
tives include aweekly give-away of ﬁeld passes

‘ gagements. ’

Enhancements to the marketing of the pro-

gram by way of adding a text—messaging pro-

inthe works. ”

In the "ﬁrst two years since the program’s
inception, nearly 100 students have received
agreen chord. ‘

OCC coordinators are conﬁdent that ﬁgure
will improve betweenthis year and 2012, when
the ﬁrst students were introduced to the pro.-
gram as freshmen, current juniors or graduate
students. a _ ’

“I eventually want to move closer and closer
to having all our students participate,” said di-
rector ofResidence Life, Shawn Brooks. “I want
to get as many students as possible invested.”

Brooks said that students interested in par-
ticipating in the e-portfolio pilot program should
contact the Residence Life ofﬁce. [

Construc ion continues on 6 projects

Michael Macagnone I Assistant News Editor:  

Construction workers might be adding
to buildings all around campus, but they
won’t be trekking through dorm rooms come
the fall. .

Pitt commissioned more than half a
dozen construction projects this summer.
But the two in student housing — Lothrop
Hall and Bouquet Gardens — won’t affect
students.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said in ear-

ly August that the renovation of Lothrop
Hall’s ﬁrst floor would ﬁnish before students
moved in, and Pitt doesn’t anticipate any
disruption from the_ expansion of the Bou-
quet Gardens apartments.

An early August meeting of the Board of
Trustees Property and Facilities Manage-
ment Committeeapproved a series of con-
struction plans for this fall. Lothrop Hall’s
renovation was approved at a previous meet-

ing and cost more than $900,000.-

The Lothrop Hall construction will add
47 beds to the dormitory, bringing the build-
ing’s total to more that 700.
g The Bouquet Gardens project will add 155
beds tothe complex, in 48 new units. The
new buildings are stationed directly south
of the current complex, between Oakland
Avenue and South Bouquet Street.

The construction will cost Pitt about-

$17 million all told, including $2.8 million
that the committee approved at its Febru-
ary meeting.

Other construction projects include ren-
ovations in the Barco Law Building and the
Concordia Club. The Barco project will in-
clude a student lounge and space for offices,
and once the Concordia club is ﬁnished, it
will house new ofﬁces and meeting spaces
for student groups. v

Pitt also approved renovations to several
academic buildings, including laboratory
renovations in the Chevron Science Center
and work in Eberly Hall, which will get a
new laboratory. _

The Cathedral of Learning will receive a
new sprinkler system on someof its ﬂoors,
and the committee also approved a backup
electrical feed for Posvar Hall, costing $1.2
million and $2.5 million, respectively. 

The committee cited an electrical outage
in 2006 that caused a number of buildings
to shut down to keep a water cooling plant
in Posvar operational as the main reason
for the project there.

The total cost for all of the projects ap-
proved at the August meeting, which did
not include the cost for the Lothrop Hall
renovations —— which had already been ap-
proved — was more than $37 million.

City bike safety
improving

.< Bikes 16 <‘

Fineberg believes, accidents like these
can put a serious strain on rider-motorist
relations, furthercomplicating an already
sensitive issue. ’ ' — ‘ ‘

“Safe and conscientious driving by both
riders and motorists is the only way to build
a quality relationship,” he said. “In my expe-
rience, I would say there is ‘a great cohesion
in Oakland and-Pittsburgh, and that has
led to somethingbigger, almost a culture
change.” T - T s . . V H .

And while Pittsburgh has had a number
of bicycle-related tragedies, that culture
change isno endorphin-fueled delusion.
In May, the League, of American Bicyclists
presented Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and the

cycling community with a “bronze” bike-‘

friendly community award. « '

That is a huge turn around for Pittsburgh,
Fineberg said, because the same’organiza-
tion once ranked thecity the third-worst
bike-friendly community in the nation.

“When you look at the number of bike
racks in the city now and the sheer num-
ber of people you see riding, this is a way
of life.” I ' ' ”

Google to pick hi

Michael Macagnone I Assistant News Editor . -

One-gigabitlntemetspeeds mightbe coming
to Pittsburgh soon. The service is either coming
here or, one of about 1,100 other cities across
the country.

Google, the Internet search giant, announced
on its public blog earlierthis monththat it intends
to create a network with 1-gigabit—per—second
speed — several times what is available through
other companies—foraU.S. city. ‘

Pittsburgh and other cities across the country

jumped into the contest, “Google Fiberfor Com—

munities,” for a chance to win the high—speed .

network. How Google will choose it’s U.S. host
cityisunknown. _ v
Despite the mystery, the mayor of Duluth,
Minn., jumped into Lake Superior as part of the
city’s bid for the Google network. Topeka, Kan.,
renamed itself“Google, Kansas” for the month
of March. -
Jake Hubert," a Google spokesman, said the
company will announce its target communities
by the end of the year. Hubert directed further

questions to the company.’s website.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg spoke in sup-
port of Pittsburgh’s bid in late March. He posted
a message on my.pitt.edu and sent an e—mail en-
couraging students to recommend Pittsburgh
forthe network. I’ .

But Pitt provides the Internet access for the
dormitories and the University itself, so all of
that speed won’t be comingto aPitt dorm, even
if the city does win. .

Carnegie,-libraries still in trouble

john Manganaro I Assistant News Editor

Just how important are libraries in an age
dominated by Google, Wrkipedia and alingering
recession that has states scrambling for cash?

That’s the question asked these days by both
the Carnegie Library ofPittsburgh and the Penn-
sylvania General Assembly. To help ﬁnd an an-
swer, the Carnegie Library system has launched
a public outreach campaign called “Tell Us Your

Story.”

The library has received hundreds of letters ‘

since the campaign’s inception, said spokeswom-
ansuzanne Thinnes. All ofthe letters voice strong
support foraPittsburgh institution on the preci-
pice of what she called “a ﬁmding disaster.”

One ofthose stories, writtenbya y_oungwom—
an from Costa Rica identiﬁed only as Miriam,
captured the campaign’s spirit.

Miriam writes that she ﬁrst visited a Pitts-
burgh library when she was 9~years-old and a
new immigra.nt to the United States.

“I loved to read in Costa Rica, butl had never
seen a library My grandmother always sent us
books,” Miriam wrote in her letter, published in
part on the library’s website. ‘A couple of days
after we moved, my mother took me to get a li-
brary card. The ﬁrst book I took outwas 21 Nancy
Drew, ‘SuperMystery.’ Iwillneverforgetthatﬁrst
day.”

Miriam’s story is echoed by many others,
Thinnes said. She thinks the outpouring of

support stands in a strong juxtaposition to the
nearly $2 million operating deﬁcit the library
system faces under the 2010-11 Pennsylvania
state budget.

. That deﬁcit is what inspired the Tell Us Your
Story initiative, along with a score of other pro-
grams, including a burgeoning Facebook group
and a grassroots lobbying campaign.

Thinnes and company hope the measures
might convince the local and state government
to redirect more public funding into the ﬂoun-
dering libraries. More money, she said, could be
used to prevent potential branch closures slated
for 2011.

“We’ve seen huge cuts, unbelievablecuts inthe
pasttwoyears,”Thinnes said. “We lost $600,000
this year alone, includingalarge partofthe tund-
ing for the Library for the Blind and Physically
Handicapped. If we don’t see an upturn, we’re
going to have to enact the 2009 action plan.”

The 2009 plan, which was put on delay by

V the library’s board of trustees until 2011, in-

volves closinga number of underused branches
in Beechview, the West End, Lawrenceville and
Hazelwood.

’ A ferocious public outcry forced the library
system to delay the closures last year, Thinnes
said, though currentﬁmdinglevels makeclosures
next year seem all but certain.

To avoid that late, the library system estab-
lishedaTask Force for Sustainable Frmdingthat
is ‘aggressively  potential revenue
sources. - V

Options currently under investigation include
everythingfromvolunteer conuibutionprograms
to newtaxes and service consolidations. Library
ofﬁcials expect a ﬁlll report from the task force
by late September, when the group will present
its ﬁndings to the board of directors.

Throughout the summer, the task force
facilitated discussion between city residents
and lawmakers through a series of forums and
workshops designed to highlight the libraries’
ﬁscal cnmch.

- State Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Allegheny, showed
up to one of the ﬁrst forums in May. There he
said that, unlike some ofhis colleagues, he does
not View the library’s budget as a discretionary
item. .

“We need to ﬁnd a balance between ﬁscal

responsibility and generating additional rev- ‘
ienue. It’s not just about cutting spending all the

time,” he said.‘ T

Now that the budget has passed, library of-
ﬁcials and community members say Frankel and
his House colleagues should have considered
other options than the six—ﬁgure funding reduc-
tion in this year’s budget.

Forallofthese reasons, Thinnes saidthestate A

of affairs has gotten desperate. So in mid—]uly, the
libraryteam approached the local govemmentto
help ﬁllthe widening gap. _

“We ﬁled a budget request to our primary
ﬁ1nderaskingfora9.8 percentincrease,”Thinnes
said. “Wewon’tknowtill Septemberwhetherthat
will plug the gap.” I

Political showdowns in the Steel City

While Pennsylvania’s hotly contested U.S.
Senate and gubernatorial elections will likely
dominate the media spotlight this fall, a few
smaller elections are expected to have a more
direct impact on Pitt students.

Daniel Wiseman and Melissa Haluszczak V

are a pair of Republicans running largely
grassroots campaigns in Pittsburgh against
Democratic incumbents. Wiseman is takingon
state Rep. Dan Frankel, D~23, and Haluszcak is
challenging Congressman Mike Doyle, D—14.A

Together, their campaigns will seek to .

bring the nation’s strongly anti-establishment

attitude to Pittsburgh in an attempt to combat .

what Republicans across the country have
called the state and federal governments’ out-

Doyle has held his seat, which represents
Pittsburgh and parts of Allegheny.'_CoiVmty, for
the past 16 years. Frankel, who ‘represents

Missing receipts

mystery:

Marissa Meredyth I Staff Writer

Students who received a letter from
Pitt about missing credit receipts can
breathe easy. No one stole them; they
just got tossed in the trash.

On April 13, Pitt spokesman john
Fedele said that all students who used
Student Health or its pharmacy from
May 1, 2009, through Nov. 30, 2009,
were sent letters reporting that receipts
containing their names, credit or debit

card numbers, card expiration dates,

and transaction dates of purchases
made were missing. A

The letter, signed by Vice Provost
and Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey,
said the receipts did not have students’
medical information, security authen-
tication codes or other “identifying”
information.

Fedele recently said in an e-mail that
the Department of Health and Human
Services has released information sup-
plied by the University’s internal in-

solved

vestigation.

The update reports that the “docu—
ments containing protected health in-
formation were lost when an employee
of the covered entity (the University of
Pittsburgh) confiscated and eventually
destroyed them.”

According to the update, “The breach
affected approximately 8,006 individu-
als.”

The University, following the breach,
is said to have “reviewed its policies
and procedures for safeguarding the
physical security of paper records,” and
the employee who violated University
policies by stealing the records was
terminated.

While the investigation is_ still on-
going, Fedele said, “The University of
Pittsburgh Police and local Financial
Crimes Task Force has not found that
any case of credit card fraud resulted
from the theft of these receipts.” I

Living a life of faith at
school no easy task

Bethie Girmai I Staff Writer

Many students associate college with its pop
culture image: parties, drinking and sex.

And although some college students do drink
andpartyto celebratethe end oft;heirschoolweek,
Omar Ayash, a recent Pitt grad, abstained ﬁ'om
such activities since coming to Pitt almost four
years ago. J

The molecularbiology, neuroscience and eco-
nomics major explained that although the college
environment makes it especially diﬁicultto abide

» bytheIslamicbe1iefthatdrinkingisasin,he_man-

aged to ﬁnd alternative outlets for ﬁm.
“Because [drinking] issoprevalent, itbecomes.

tempting to also think, well, that’s the only way ,
to have ﬁm, but there’s other waysto have ﬁ1n,”.

Ayash said. “I’ve been abletohavefunforfouryears
without drinking and it’s worked out OK.”

The college life stereotype can make life dif-
ﬁcultfor st11dents like Ayash, who choose to reject
the aspectsof college thatmanyreligions classify
as sinﬁrl. Instead they rely on their faith to help
them navigate the stresses of student life.

Ayash said that, although the temptation is
thereto drink, the strength ofhis faith allowshirn
to reject the temptations.

“In myfaith, the greaterthe temptationtosin,
the more you are rewarded for not sinning,” he

— said. “IfI genuinely believe in this, then I’ll ﬁnd

alternatives and I’ll avoid those situations, and
if I can’t avoid them, then I’ll just weather the

storm. ‘
Ayashsaidhisfaithinlslamhasbeenasource

V of comfortthroughouthis college years. T

“The reasonlwould say [religion] is important
isthe same reasonpeopleﬁndcomfortinreligion,
in general, which is that faith and that rock help

iyouwhenthings gettough,” he said. '.

“In my faith, the greater
the temptation to sin, the
more you are rewarded
for not sinning’’

-- Omar Ayash l -

Ayash explained that, although"ﬁln,_djng, a
healthy balance between studentlife and religious
practices can prove diﬂicult, he has learned to
makehisfaithapriority. . « .

‘As astudent, every hour of the day becorn
accounted for, and even the hours that aren’t ex-
plicitly accounted forare implicitly accounted for,
because you need to relax your brain, you need
to notbe at ameeting, you need to notbetaking

r. atest,” he said.

Fatherjoseph Kibler, a Catholic priest at the
Ryan Catholic Newman Center near campus, be-
lievesthatstudents mustunderstandtheir religion
in orderto successﬁilly uphold its practices;

“Ifthe only reasonyou attend mass athomeis

topleaseyourparents, thenyou’re probablynotgo-

V alcohol tisé;'th6ugtr H

ingto see the beneﬁts ifyou go to masswhenyotfre
away from home,” Kibler said. “Students needto
remember the reason to go to mass is to receive
instruction and help in living your faith life.”

Kibler believes students must be able to pri-
oritize their activities, in order to ﬁnd a balance
between social life and faith

“’I‘here’s a saying: ‘Ifyou’re too busy to pray,
then you’re too busy?” he said. “It’s kind of like
askinghow do you ﬁtineating, or exercise or time

g with friends.’_’

One particular issue of contention, especially
for Muslim students, is drinking and drug use.
That does not mean that all students who identify
themselves as religious  from moderate

Although some religions classify drinking as

a sin, Becca Tanen, another Pitt student, believes
Judaism encourages it.

The Englishwriting majoris the currentpresi-
dent ofPitt’s branch ofHillel, ajewish organization
that seeks to enrich the lives ofjewish students.-

“We sanctify many holidays, prayers and -

blessings with wine, [so] it’s not uncommon to
 wine at a Friday night celebration if it is for
religious purposes,” she said. “Jews have never

a really felt guilty about [drinking] when they've

come to college because it’s  been part of
our all .” ’ if

Tanen also  the Jewish faith is "l

more concerned withthe observation of certain rit-
uals than it is with the taboo of pre—marital sex.
“When it comes to pre-marital sex, Judaism
does technicallyforbid it, but they’re not as strict
about itas theyare about interfaith  and
observing some of the laws, like keeping kosher,”
Tanen said. ‘ 1 . .
Tanen said that she believes keeping kosher

. is the most difﬁcult ritual forjewish students to

uphold.

. Rabbi Scott Aaron, the community scholarfor
the Agency forjewish Learning of Greater Pitts-
burgh, said the best way to learn to successfully
keep kosher and follow other faith-based laws is
to do it gradually.

‘ “Don’tworr'yaboutdoingeverythingthatyou
can or could do in your home with a real salary,
[but] do what you can until you can, or are ready
to do rnore,”said.“‘Ifyouaredoingthebest
you can, orwhatyouthinkis the bestforyou and
your religious outlook, then God will be honored
by your efforts and supportive of your choices.”
' Aaron, who practices post-denorninational
Judaism, encourages college students to examine
all aspects" of their beliefs. ' v ,
“Ithinkstudents should experirnentwiththeir
newfoundfreedomto seewhatworks forthemin
terms of all religious observance,” he said. ‘ ,
The rabbi believes students can use religion
to learn more about themselves and what they
ultimately want out oflife. . i I ‘
‘‘Itis part of determiningpersonal meaningin
daily life,” Aaron said. “You don’t know what you
truly believe until you explore and challenge it.” |

Two restaurants open, third planned

Estelle Tran I Senior Staff Writer

Oakland got a lot sweeter this
summer.

With the opening of a Dunkin’
Donuts on Forbes Avenue and a
Dozen Bake Shop on South Craig_
Street, students have more op-

' tions to satisfy their sugar crav-

ings. -

The spiking local glucose
levels seemed to raise one ques-
tion: Whose cream will reign
supreme?

In the blue corner, there’s the
Dozen Bake Shop at 417 S. Craig
St.

Manager Tanya Bielski—Bra—

T lhamlfsaid Dozen‘ is Pittsburgh’s

premiere cupcake shop, although
it’s also famous for its rice crispy
treats, pies and lunch fare. The
bakery brings 32 cupcake variet-
ies to our sugary bout.

In the orange corner, the new-
est Dunkin’ Donuts, located at
3907 Forbes Ave., will have the

most seating of any Dunkin’
Donuts in the area.

The student-friendly restau-
rant has about 60 cushioned
chairs, free Wi-Fi,'a downstairs
seating area called “the Panther
Den” and a midnight closing time
every day. I '

Robyn Frederick, vice presi-
dent of marketing and operations
for the Heartland Restaurant
Group, said the restaurant might
extend its hours around finals
week and offer beverage deals in
a “fuel for finals” program.

The new restaurant also fea-

tures a ﬁreplace‘; a small confer-”

ence room, two ﬂat-screen TVs
and a garage door that gives the
dining area an open—air environ-
ment. T V y .
Corrie Anderson, an applied
developmental psychology grad
student at Pitt, enjoyed her blue-
berry coffee and the feel of the
restaurant onyits opening day.

previously collected trash are now working on
recycling collection. ‘

“At the sametime thatwe broughtinthe Big-
Bellys,wewere expanding, workingon ourweekly
single~stream recycling collection. So instead of
having recycling collections every other week,
we now have recycling collection every week,”
she said. _ ’

Philadelphia bought 210 recycling units for
paper, glass, plasﬁc and aluminum recycling.

‘Rebecca Schroeder, co—president of Free the
Planet, a Pitt student environmental group, said
it’s difﬁcult to ﬁnd recycling in Oakland and in
many University buildings.

“There’s pretty much a trash can wherever
I need it, but there isn’t recycling in key places.
There’s recycling on every ﬂoor of the Union, ex-
ceptwhere food is,” she said. ,

Fedele said the University would consider
buying these non—compaction recycling units if
itpurchases the trash compactors. Theﬁnaldeci—
sion about whether to purchase the units would
fall on the University’s different administrative
sectors, including Housing, Food Services and
Facilities Management.

The staffers inchargeofthese sectors mightbe

inclir1edtobuytheunitsifthey“savetheUniversity ‘

moneyand makeusmore productive,” Fedele said.
He said the grounds division empties between 80

T In Philly’s footsteps

to1o0 trashcansdaily. D

“We are hoping that if this container is tested
successfully that it could reduce that to possibly
twice weekly, therefore allowing additional time
to be dedicated to the beautiﬁcation of tlie cam-
pus,” he said. -

Tolson said that Philadelphia received $2 mil-
lion in state grants and athree-year lease—to—own
programtobuythe BigBelly compactors. She said
the compactors will pay themselves off in three

years andplansareintheworkstobuy465 more

units with the city’s Recovery Act funding.
Philadelphia purchased the compactors for a
record—lowprice because ofthe quantity it ordered.
Tolson said the compactors cost the city $3,025
each, and the recycling units cost $776 each.
The compactors canalso befound onthe Uni-

versity of Pennsylvanias campus, Philadelphia l

University’s campus, Arizona State University’s
 and the cities of Boston, New York and
 A - l I

Though Schroederis pleasedto hearthatthese
universities and cities have reduced their carbon
footprint and saved money, she would prefer to
stop the problem at its source. ,  “

‘‘Ithinkit’sagreatI:hing,butobviouslywewant
to be focusing on minimizing trash production,”
she said. “Ithinkit’s goodifthey domakestudents

the city toplacethe network, he said.
Graham called Google’s contest a “last—mile

service” that would not necessarily add to Pitfs '

network. . -

. “Essentially it would be running alongside
a parallel network,” Graham said. “It wouldn’t
buyus much.” V

The technology for Google’s contest is similar
to Pitfs network, he said. Pitthas a10 gigabit-per-
second “backbone” to its networkthat is shared
across the campus, he said. The dormitories on
campus share asoo megabit-per-second connec-
tion, and the speed for‘ each Pitt student would
depend upon how many people were using the
network atthe time. . - '

’ CMU’s networkisinasimilar sitnationto Pitt's,
Phillip Leeman, associate dean of strategic initia-
tives for Carnegie Mellon’s Schgol of Computer
Science, said inApril. _

“We already have afairly fast connection,” he
said. “Students shouldthinkaboutthe contestas
citizens of tile city.” V

Off-campus students could see huge beneﬁts
ﬁ‘om’the contest, as could the city as a whole,
he said. ,

The contest, ashe understood it,was “focused
on homes, and most of the connections would
beat homes.” A A A

Leeman said  several CMU graduates
have been  into the Google office in
Pittsburgh, on Forbes Avenue. That office was
successﬁil enough, Leeman said, that it would

be movingtoalarger oﬂice soon. .

An e-mail from Minnie Ingersoll, a product
manager on Google’s alternative access team, did
notsaywhetherthe presence of a Google ofﬁcein
a city would heighten its chances of winning.

Ingersoll did not explain Google’s selection
process, sayingonly thatthe companyislooking
“for the right community partners.”

. Cities inthe contestinPennsylvania, accord-
ing to Google’s website, include Philadelphia,
Harrisburg, State College, Erie, Bethlehem and
nearbyvenango County. Morgantown, W.Va., and
Youngstown, Ohio, also entered thecontest.

Someoftheothercitiesthathaveenteredthe .

contest publicly include Topeka —— no longer

Peoria, HL; and Greenville, S.C.

Greenville’s public display — with a larger . .

crowd — was similar to Pittsburglfs. Hundreds
of people lined up with different colored lights

, at night to spell, “Google” on Main Street in

Greenville. ,

Leeman said Pittsburghs size, which the Cen-
sus Bureau estimated atabout3o0,o00 in2006,
put the city in “a sweet spot” for Google.

_ Googlewasalsolookingforacommunitythat

tion,”Leeman said. .

New dining options include cupcakes, donuts

< Restaurants 44 <

“I feel more likely to come to Dunkin’
Donuts vs. other chains because it seems
happy and bright,” she said. “I like the
open window. I’m sure it’ll be entertaining
on a Friday night.”

Onjuly 20, opening day, people waited
outside the door to get their coffee and
donuts. Stacked orange and yellow bal-
loons alerted passersby that the store had
ﬁnally opened. ‘ ,

The week before, the staff practiced
making about 250 dozen donuts per day
and gave them away to local businesses
and offices. Countless people pulled on

the store’s fuschia “D” door handle only '

to be denied doughy goodness.

Frederick said the store sold 300 dozen
donuts, 500 cups of hot coffee and more
than 600 iced beverages to about 1,800
guests on opening day.

Already a Pitt football and basketball
sponsor, Dunkin’ Donuts wants to play a
bigger role in the Pitt community, Fred-
erick said.

The Oakland restaurant offers a special
Pitt donut, which has white frosting and
blue and yellow sprinkles. The donut is
available every day, but the restaurant
will have special promotions for Pitt fans
on game days.

Each day of the week, a different cup-
cake is on the menu, so manager Bielski-
Braham said it’s hard to pick out a to
seller. , A

She said Dozen wants to get more in-
volved with the universities by offering
fundraising and catering. '

“We do great pies come Thanksgiv-
ing. We anticipate that faculty members
will buy the pumpkin pies and cinnamon
rolls,” she said. “Cosmo cupcakes and pina
colada cupcakes would be really good for
parties.”

Each day, the bake shops feature seven
cupcakes — six regular and one vegan.
They also offer two ﬂavors daily: the va-
nilla Vanilla cupcake and the milk choco-
late. Some other ﬂavors are key lime pie on
Tuesdays, peanut butter cup on Thursdays
and margarita on Fridays. -

Oakland’s Dozen Bake Shop is sched-
uled to open Aug. 12 in the former location
of Mark Anthony Beauty Bar.

Pitt Athletics donated jerseys that Pitt
basketball player Ashton Gibbs and Pitt
running back Dion Lewis signed. The jer-
seys will be displayed in the restaurant.

Four more~D_unkin’ Donuts restaurants
will open around the city this year —— in h
Pleasant Hills, West View, Greensburg and
Downtown on Grant Street.

‘ “I feel more likely to

come to Dunkin’ Donuts
vs. other chains because
it seems happy and
bright.”

-— Corrie Anderson '

Dozen Bake Shopon Craig Street has‘
also seen a recent and rapid expansion.
The Oakland location is the store’s sixth,
but like most of the other locations, bak-
ing will not take place there. All the cup-
cakes are made at the Lawrericeville loca-
tion in the morning and shipped to the
Dozen stores in Squirrel Hill, the South.
Side, Downtown and the Andy Warhol
Niuseum. - -

Schenley Plaza: the place for smiles.

Plans for the new Eat’n Park Hospitality
Group restaurant — which will not be an
Eat ’n Park — in Schenley Plaza are mov-
in-gforward. The group has been going

through the public process, clearing plans
with the zoning board and the Pittsburgh
Parks Conservancy. , -

Mark Broadhurst, director of concept
development, said the company hopes to
break ground on the grassy area close to
Hillman Library in November and open
in April or May.

“Our goal was to have as little impact on
the plaza when it’s being used,” he said.

The late start in construction could be_ a
gamble because if the construction work-
ers don’t startin November, the company
must wait until February or March to start
building.

Broadhurst said the company has yet ~

to choose a name for the restaurant. He

anticipates the food will be primarily '

American bistro food that can be made
quickly from scratch.

The restaurant will utilize a wood-
burning oven and a rotisserie to prepare
the food on the restaurant’s changing
menu. - V «

It will offer an on—the-go breakfast
menu, as well as late-night dinner options
with a beer and wine menu.

The restaurant design allows for about

‘ 140 seats inside, as well as a patio area for
outdoor dining. I

Will new

provost r p

bring fresh ideas?

hen selecting a new
W provost, Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg kept

it in the family by choosing previ-_
_ ous vice provost, Patricia Beeson,

for the job.

Out of six ﬁnal nominees for
the positions, Beeson was the only
applicant holding a current posi-
tion at the University. The other
ﬁve ﬁnal candidates came from
institutions and positions outside
of Pitt.

According to a 2009 Chief Aca-
demic Office national census by
the American Council on Educa-
tion, internal hiring for provosts
is not uncommon. Fifty-two per-
cent of CAOs are promoted to
their positions from within their
current institutions.

Beeson has replaced former
provost, James V. Maher, who is
returning to a faculty position
after 15 years of service.

Beeson, however, has been
employed by the University for
more than 27 years. Because there
is such an even split between the
number of internal and external
CAO hires according to the ACE
poll, it seems that the pros and
cons of hiring an insider like
Beeson are balanced. But after
such a lengthy career at Pitt, we
hope Beeson can still contribute

. new ideas and take a fresh per-
. spective so that she can properly

serve and excel as provost.

The results of the census also

show that the likelihood of a CAO
being promoted internally is de-
pendent on the length of time
that individual has spent at the
institution.

“Only 39 percent of CAOs three _

years or less on thejob have spent
their administrative careers at
one institution, compared with
47 percent of CAOs who have
served three to six years and 56
percent of CAOs withseven or

v ~ . - : : . . . _ . . . . . . _ . .

more years experience,” accord-
ing to the census.

Claire Van Ummersen, the vice
president of the ACE’s Center for
Effective Leadership, said there
are beneﬁts to both hiring inter-
nally and to bringing people in
from the outside.

“People from outside have a
fresh eye and new ideas, but they
have to learn the culture of the
institution,” Van Ummersen said.
“[When you’re hired internally],
you know the culture well. You
know the faculty. You have estab-
lished relationships and partner-

ships already. You know where ‘

there may or may not be prob-
lems, so you can hit the ground

. running.”

Beeson has certainly shown
a dedication to the University
through her long stay with Pitt,
and her familiarity of the school’s
workings should be advantageous.
But is it advisable to hire inter-
nally? Most likely, it will depend
more on the individual rather
than the ind_ividual’s previous
position.

“I know people who were very
successful who have been hired
internally and externally,” Van
Ummersen said. “It depends
more on the characteristics of
the person and the needs of the
institution.”

And although outsiders bring
a fresh eye and new ideas to an
institution, Van Ummersen added
that some people are “just good”
at coming up with ideas.

Let’s hope this is the case with
Beeson. Amid Pitt’s upcoming tu-
ition hike, funding issues with the
state and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl’s earlier proposal to
tax students their “fair share,”
Pitt’s seen no shortage of obsta-
cles in recent memory. We wish
Beeson the best, for her and all
of Pitt’s sake. I

Mark Kozlowski Columnist

In the last 120 minutes of a month-
long celebration of sport, Spain and
the Netherlands were locked in a tie

before millions on TV and millions ’

more awaiting news out of Sout
Africa. . . '
July 11, theﬁnals of the ﬁrst Afri-

can World Cup, was a day the earth ,

moved a little slower than usual.
With an estimated 240 million reg-
istered players worldwide and more
than a billion fans who might not be
registered, prettymuch‘ the whole
world loves soccer .+ except, of
course, some loud people. ,

In the United States at least, the
“Football is for fools” folks can be
heard on TV, in the sports sections
of newspapers and on blogs. We’ve
heard their usual complaints: Soccer
is boring, the scores are miniscule,

' \.

it’s just a bunch of people‘ running-
. around, and my kid can do that.

Besides, soccer is a girly sport in

V which real men would neverengage

—. unlike real sports, like football,

hockey. and baseball.

I realize there is no account-

, ing for taste, but there is plenty of
’ _ignorance tovaccount for in those
' expressing vehement distaste of

a sport they. clearly don’t under-

sense and arough idea of
where 22 players are at all

have a split second to
move to one of them.” .

I don’t intend to say soccer is bet-

All I’m saying is, the enthusiasm for
soccer is far from delusional.

It would seem a legitimate com-

'plaintto grumble that soccer is low-

scoring, but let’s consider an anal-
ogy —— a’ sport that is usually used
as something much more exciting
than soccer: American football.

SOME UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

Getting college right the5th year around

 

Jacob Brown I Columnist

College, you’re a masochist. Cru-
elly, you prod thousands of new
students into your depths every
year, comforting them, forcing
them into kinship with one an-
other. _

_ Incidentally, we the students
become pigeonholed into emo-
tionally involved pseudo—families
of our respective classes of insert
graduation year here.

But then toward the end of the
experience, college partners up
with reality to punch you in the
face. At least it did for me last
year when I realized that most
of my friends would graduate
long before I would, abandon-
ing me. A

See, I’m a ﬁfth-year student,
more than ready to move on —
mentally, but not quite as ready

academically. For a while, I
feared this new school year
would be one of loneliness and
boredom — never a good com-
bination. .
But thinking about it this
summer changed my perspec-
tive. This isn’t some slow and
painful ending — it’s a grown-

up’s version of freshman year, ‘

anxious excitement and all.
Reconciling the two polar out-
looks wasn’t easy for me, though.
When the late—April pomp and
circumstance cut ties between
me and a bunch of people with
whom I had spent about 20 per-
cent of my life, Facebook only
went so far to help me keep up
with them. -
According to CollegeResults.
org, just less than 75 percent of

August 2 5, 2010 I The Pitt News I WWW.pittnews.com

Pitt students graduate in ﬁve
years. But those numbers don’t
include students who trans-

ferred, skewing the statistic -

of just how many people cycle
through the school. -

just enough game, ﬁnd some new
friends or woo some freshman
girls, more power to you.

But if your name isn’t Rico
Suave, there are other ways to
make new friends, such as recon-

I “This isn’t some slow and painful ending -
it’s a grown-up’s version of freshman year,

anxious excitement and all.”

So how do you move on from

. old college friendships? You make
— new friends — that’s how.

Going to parties is one way to

. meet new people, but chances are

you will look awkward among the
underclassmen. If you can pull
off the naive freshman vibe with

_J

necting with old" friends and net-
working through them. That too
might initially be a bit awkward,
but for the ﬁfth-year student, it
has a signiﬁcant, positive side
effect: relearning people skills.
After cliquing with people in
clubs and.organizations for a few

years, I had some slight myopia
when it came to calling different.
friends to hang out. With moving
through the ranks over the years,
my later years in some clubs felt
like there was a generational dis-
connect between-me and some of
the newer members.

Maybe the lingering thought
of knowing some of them were
still in diapers when ‘‘Jurassic
Park?’ came out exacerbates that

rift. But hanging out with people >

my age has its advantages.
Makingyfriends with fresh-
men and sophomores won’t kill
me or any other soon-to-be-
graduating senior. But it won’t
help too many of us, either. See,
that thing after college — you
know, the real world — is ap-
proaching awfully quickly.

Found a job while in college? Don’t blow it

Ragini Grace Gupta | Columnist

Whether you’re looking for a
summer job, trying to turn your
summer gig into something more
long term or just trying to keep
your “day job,” now is as good a
time as ever to take a step back

- and really evaluate what kind of

employee you are.

It’s tough ﬁnding a job these
days. So when you do, make sure
you keep it. Yet there’s still one
thing to take solace in — there is
no’ substitute for honest and hard
work. In a boss’s eyes, there’s a
simple formula: If you’re worth
your pay, you can stick around.
He might even increase your
hourly.

But ﬁrst thing’s first if you ever
want to see that raise don’t try to
get paid for more hours than you

worked. It’s tempting and frankly
often easy to fudge the hours you

worked —— for example, saying.

you left at 5:30 p.m. but actually
leaving 10 minutes prior.

Businesses like expensive

things when their customers buy

them, not when the expensive
thing is an employee. If you’re ex-
pensive, employers start to ques-

l “As an employee, you have to be worth the

money you receive.” .

Don’t try to take extra long
breaks when no one is there
to know otherwise. As an em-
ployee, you have to be worth the
money you receive —— again, it’s
the golden rule of the working
world — compared to the work
you accomplish.

.J

tion your number of hours, salary ‘

and most importantly, their need
for you. A little extra dough is not
worth losing your j.ob. '

Even before you start a job,
honesty is worth keeping in
mind. It’s tempting to embel-
lish a flat resume with wonder-

College challenges
not all in coursework

I

 

Oliver Bateman I Columnist I

After a long summer of total inactivity,
returning to school requires readjusting
to the tedium of the academic routine.
Few experiences can equal the challenge’
of college, which requires an ability to
balance-the demands of sleeping in exces-
sively with the desire to eat ﬁve $5 pizzas
at 3 a.m. I
Studentsarebound to struggle with a

schedule that now includes slightly more

activity. Four classes per week is a burden,
and there is really no good way to ﬁt them
around nine hours of “Call of Duty 3” and
multiple viewings of the DVD outtake reel
from the latest hot college comedy.

' If you schedule your classes in the

morning, you have to ﬁght fatigue. Classes _
_scheduled after lunch will surely find you.

too stuffed with french fries and nacho
cheese sauce toconcentrate, and night
classes? Mygoodness, there’s no way you
can be expected to stay up so late.

You will also have_to reintegrate your- A

self into the social scene. Thanks to net-
working sites like Facebook, you prob-
ably have followed your friends’ goings-on
during the summer. But now that you are
back on campus, you need to make it to all
their big soirées and bashes — or at least
click on the “Attending” option on their
e-vites, which is pretty much the same as
attending the real event.

l “That \ eminently

quotable hot college
comedy. will become
the stuff of VH1’s ‘I,

Love the ..~.’ ‘seriesf’, ' I

Your college girlfriend or boyfriend will
require some attention, too. You might
have left your significant other in the lurch
while you were gallivanting around your
hometown, but now you will have to do
some serious relationship maintenance.

He or she will want time together, which ‘

means less “Call of Duty 3” and more long
walks through. museums, parks and con-

other will even request a meal that costs
more than a $5 pizza, which can be a real
strain on that beer budget.

If you worked ‘a job during the sum-
mer, you probably didn’t have to do any
homework. Fortunately, most homework

just consists of reading a bunch of pages in"

those expensiveitextbooks that Wikipedia
has made obsolete. If you play your cards
right, you can find almost everything you

«need toknow on Wikipedia, including the

answers to old tests and the truth about
Lady Gaga (spoiler alert: Lady Gaga is a
woman!). I -

If you are returning from a study abroad
program in some distant land, though,

,« your readjustment might -be a bit easier. '

You probably spent thesummer semes-
ter partying hearty, making occasional
appearances in your classes and taking
photos of historic buildings. In that case,
just cut out the part about taking photos

roll. I

. Of course, if this is your last semester,
all bets are off. You need to treat the ex-
perience like your farewell tour. Remind
your friends that you are about to enter
the “real world,” which-differs from school
or summer vacation in thatits duration is
indeﬁnite and its requirements for gradu-
ation are largely unknown. Mention fre-
quently that you feel very old and want to

"get started on the rest of your life, then

begin hurriedly applying to graduate and

‘ professional schools when hard economic

times postpone the rest of that life. I
I At the rate things are going, your col-

lege routine might last for five or six more I

years. During that time, clothing styles

will change and pop culture staples like -.

Lady Gaga and that eminently quotable

- hot college comedy will become__ the stuff

of VH1’s “I Love the  ” series. But pizza

will probably still ‘be available inrthe $5

price range, so don’t worry about going
hungry. , V -

August 25, 2010 I The. Pitt News I WWw.pittneWs.com

Iwill read the chapter before lec-
ture. I will go to every lecture this

my assignments.
Oh, the foolishness of it all.
Every year since the beginning
-of middle school, these prom-
‘ises circulate in my head as I at-
tempt a new era of preparedness
‘and responsibility. But like New
Year’s resolutions and opening

b ‘day promises of the Pirates, af-

ter two weeks these declarations
A become mere suggestions, the
suggestions become idealizations
and, ﬁnally, the idealizations be-
come broken promises. .
But why do we do this? Clearly,
based on our promises, we realize
«that working will make us hap-
‘pier, either through better grades
‘or self-satisfaction. We wouldn’t
‘make these commitments if we
felt otherwise. So by not follow-
ing through, we’re actively de-

year. I will not procrastinate with

ciding to decrease our personal
happiness. It doesn’t make sense.
Why would we choose to make
ourselves less happy?

The reason is that we don’t
have stablepreferences or stable

. beliefs that guide our happiness.

Sometimes we are clear thinkers
who can weigh risks and beneﬁts
to achieve our highest personal
happiness, and sometimes we’re
controlled by our “other self,” an

- impulsive Schmuck whose prefer-

ences are not for'long—term'hap'-
piness but short—term elation.

We’re all well acquainted with A

this other self: When faced with

a big bowl of ice cream, for in-
stance, he’s the guy forcing us
to continue gorging, despite

what the more rational self says. I

Continued eating makes us less
happy in the long run — feeling
bloated and stuffed - but we do
it anyway.

While the other self is prob— .

ably responsible for most of our
epic, frenzied college nights, al-
lowing it to control our lives can
lead to poor long-term decisions.
Be it bad grades, overeating or
national prosperity, it must be
controlledjor our future’s sake.

I say naitional prosperity be-

“Be itbad grades, overeating or national
prosperity, it must be controlled for our

l future’s sake.”

‘cause policy decisions are even

subject to the wrath of the other
self. More often than not, leaders
ﬁght more for tax cuts or entitle-
ment programs instead of longer
term,less-exciting infrastructure
and education programs. There
are myriad inﬂuences behind po-
litical decisions, but the other
self unfailingly creeps into po-
litical ﬁgures’ plans, leaving
them satisﬁed with a picture in
the paper and votes in the next

. election —— but too often with the

long-term health of the country

- suffering.

So what can we do about this?
First, we should acknowledge this
personal discrepancy, this human
ﬂaw, and make a conscious effort
to tame the other self, both in our
personal lives and_ our govern-
ment. There’s no magic ﬁx, but it
can be done. Dwight Eisenhower

Long-term happiness can be
achieved.

Summerﬂicks are lacking quality content?

 

by Steve Kaszycki I Columnist

A Each year, movie studios spend

I tens of millions of dollars pro-

‘ moting their batch of summer
' movies. But what does it mean
1 to be a “summer” movie?

It usually means having a
. very large budget with sub-

 stantial cash for special effects.

= The “Spider-Man” series, par-

 ticularly the latter two entries,

" illustrate this trend, as do the

“Jurassic Park” ﬁlms from a few.

years ago.

One major motivator behind

visual effects of the film than
the story and the quality of act-
ing.

Another reason might be the
cultural image of summer. It’s
a time to relax, a time to enjoy
the sun and the water and oc-
casionally hide indoors from
mosquitoes. Kids have a three-
month reprieve from homework
and tests. Heck, most college

students do, too, though I’ve

always found the prospect of
working full-time much less en-
joyable, paycheck aside, than
taking classes.

So who wants to tax his brain
with a challenging movie? Who
wants to watch heavy drama or
intellectual sci-f1?_ We all want
to see giant robots clashing into
each other and cars speeding

Winter is the fun movie-going season

Now, how do I put this politely? Both of my
sisters are extremely well endowed in the chest
region. What makes matters more difﬁcult is
that one of my sisters is three years younger
than I am. ‘

When she surpassed me in bra size, I didn’t
panic. Everyone always told me thatl would just
wake up one morning and BAM! I’d have boobs.
“ ust watch, Lexie,” they would say, “you’ll be
bigger than all of us.” V '

After about 12 years of waking up in the
morning only to ﬁnd that I hadrft magically
sprouted any melons —— or even grapefruits
would be nice — I’m ﬁnally giving up at the age
of 21. This is as big as they will get.

I’ll admit that my breastlessness wouldn’t
bother me so much if it weren’t for my sisters
and my constant comparison to them.

For years I’ve worn bras that are too big
for me, just to give the illusion that something
is there. That’s right — I live a lie. This ends
up being a cruel joke for boys who eventually
discover the truth. Their confusion and disap-
pointment are almost as bad as mine when I
contemplate my DNA. ‘ if

I’ve come to the conclusion that my sisters

rhoggedall the boob genes, alongwith the good

singing genes.

Other than living my lie, I have found I didn’t
have many options. Can you imagine my disap-
pointment when my boobs didn’t get bigger
afterlwent on birth control? ‘

Convinced that the hormones in cow’s
milk would make my boobs bigger, I started
drinking three glasses per day. This probably
wouldn’t seem so desperateif I wasn’t lactose
intolerant. A A V ‘ I " ‘ I

I also responded to a casting call for 1VI'I‘V’s
“True Life” to be on “-True Life:iI hate my small
breasts.” I thought some plastic surgeon might
take pity on me and give mean augmentation

for free. Unfortunately, I didn’t get cast.

But I had to wonder, would silicon make me
feel better? Sure, they would look bigger and
maybe fool other people, but they wouldn’t
fool me. They would still be a lie, just like my
oversized bras and the tubesocks I might shove
in them. Was‘ it even my small chest that was
making me upset, or justthe fact thatlhad been
genetically cheated?

Besides, what am I really missing out on?
Some might even consider me lucky. No com-
plications come with small boobs, except for
not being able to ﬁll out certain articles of

'- clothing;

Large breasts, on the other hand, can lead‘
to back problems and bad posture, in addition
to eventual unsightly saggage, not to mention I

will never have to worry about being slapped in .

the face by my own bosom while running.

I will undoubtedly be crept on far less by
men than women who have large chests, and
while my face has to be much nicer to com-
pensate, I luckily wasn’t swindled in the facial
region — this mugwas carved by angels.

If I’ve learned anything from having small
breasts, it’s the timeless lesson that life isn’t
fair. I might feel like I’m missing out on some
of the curvy glory of being a woman, but I will
never have to triple layer my sports bras before
Iexercise. While my boobswillnever get me out

4 of a speeding ticket or into a club, I luckily don’t
have that extra 10 pounds to carry around that
busty beauties do, . .

I’ve also been forced, through the negative

comments about my small breasts by others,

, to be conﬁdent and se_cure in myselfand other
. parts of my body. I might have a ﬂat chest, but

There are plenty of reasons to be worried
about starting college. But concerns about
making friends, ﬁnding your way around
campus and living away from home for
the ﬁrst time are nothing compared to:

,

the dreaded freshman 15.

You’ve likely heard the stories about
slim young people who go off to college
and return with some extra padding, and
you’ve probably even seen the Facebook

you can keep the weight off.

First, it’s important to avoid the temp-

want now that you aren’t having whole-

some home cooked meals. Chances are
if you’re a freshman, you’ll be eating the

‘majority of your meals at campus dining

halls like Marketscentral and The Perch or

using your dining dollars at the Union or
the Cathedral Café, where it’s easy to ﬁnd
unhealthy food. When you decide to treat
yourself to.something outside of your meal
plan, you’ll most likely be eating at one of
the relatively inexpensive chains close to
campus, like Chipotle or Five Guys. These
homes of delicious calorie bombs are not
exactly the best options if you’re looking
to avoid the freshman 15. W

But there are ways to eat nutritiously
on and near campus. Most of the campus
dining facilities offer decent salad bars as
well as stations where you can make your
own sandwich, which allows you to choose
the healthier ingredients you want.

But keep in mind the food you should
have available in your dorm room. Since
freshman housing isn’t normally equipped
with kitchen facilities, I recommend keep-
ing things like‘ fruit and yogurt in your

, room for breakfast or for when you need
a quick snack. ‘ 3 V _

Arguably the biggest culprit behind the
freshman 15, however, is late-night eating.
Your ﬁrst year of college, you’ll inevitably
end up staying out late with your friends,
gettinghungry and looking for something
to eat. And/with great late-night dealsat
pizza placesvlike Sorrento’s or Antoons on
Atwood Street or access to The Original
Hot Dog Shop and McDonald’s, you’re

T. likely to grab extra meals" you might net

‘otherwise eat during the day. ‘ F F; T‘ 
Clearly, the best option to avoid weight
gain is to forego the after—hours food bing-
A es entirely. But if you absolutely must

i — fulﬁll your .late night cravings, in order

. to avoid ending up stuffing your face_with
fried food,°’keep in mind that there are
other options. Places like Fuel & Fuddle
andjoe Mamas havelate-night half-price
menus, as well as options that are decid-

_‘ edly healthier than burgers and fries.

. And as much as you probably don’t
want to: hear it, exercise is another impor-
tant factor in avoiding the freshman 15.
However, it’s really not as much of a hassle
as you might think. There are exercise
facilities conveniently locatedfeither in-A

." ‘ side of or close to most of the on—campus

residence halls,a”nd Pitt shuttles will drop
you off right outside the doors. '_

Why is it that women don’t share this lack of
censorship when it comes to their sexual solo
sessions? Some ladies even seem appalled bythe
idea of female masturbation, as if it’s something
that’s OK for only men to do.

  

 “l/Vhy is it that women
don’t share this lack
of censorship when it _
comes to their sexual

solo sessions?” ‘

 

A female friend approachedme a few days
ago for advice, knowing I wouldn’t be ashamed
to speak my mind on the subject. She wanted to
surprise her longtime boyfriendin bed. Almost
jokingly, I nonchalantly replied‘f]ustl_ayinfront of

him and touch yourself.” Her facewas indescrib-
able. Itwas like amixuire of surprise, disgust and
horror. She returned the shockbytelling me that
she wasn’t sure she could go through with it, but
that she really wanted to.

Do reactions like this stem from the age-old *

societal pressures thatwomen must conform to
tradition and “act like a lady,” leaving things to
the imagination? '

One guy I asked explained that“whenwomen
admit to it, they tend to look as if they want to
ﬂaunt it, makingthem seem slutty and easy. But
they shouldn’t freak out and overreact about it.

‘ It’s natural.” Another one laughed and said, “I

wish girls talked about it more. I picture them
stereotypically turning off the lights, lighting a
hundred candles in their silk robes and getting
inbetween the sheetstodo itbecause no girlwill
actually say how it really goes down.”

The sadthingis thatmost girls even have the
nerve to reverse our sexual progress and cry out
withdisgust, “Ew, that’s gross! Iwould never do
that.” Women should do and saywhattheyplease

when it comes to their own sex life. Ifyou don’t
want to, then that’s your choice. But don’t make
comments against other women’s actions unless
you’ve tried at least once and can make a valid

argument. Hundreds of sex toys geared toward _

this purpose aren’t leaving store shelves daily
because women don’t do it.

So girls, if you do masturbate and want to
admit it, go right ahead. Don’t be aﬁaid. If you
haven’t ever tried it and have a bit of curiosity,
I fully encourage you to take 10 minutes out of
your schedule to relax and enjoy yourself 0
harmcan come from knowingwhat pleases you
in the bedroom.

is continuous for 45 minutes per half, plus
some additional time. Each team is allowed
only three substitutes for an 11—man side.
So the vast majority of the 11 starters must
run for 90 minutes with only a 15-minute
break between halves. Other than the goalie,

v players run anywhere from 9 to 13 kilometers

— or between four andsix miles —— and sprint
on average every 90 seconds.
A typical shot on goal at 18 yards away

  
 
  
    
      

from the goal travels at more than 60 miles

‘per hour, and the goal that the keeper must

protect is 8 feet by 24 feet, roughly the size
of a two-car garage.

It is perfectly legal to use your shoulder
to bump an opposing player. It is also legal
to conduct a baseball slide into the ball. If
another player happens to touch that ball
and gets sent ﬂying, play continues.

If a particularly nasty foul occurs, the
player is ejected. No penalty box, and no

substitution for thatplayer. You continue
with one fewer player than before. Oh, yes,
and faking an injury can, in theory, draw a
yellow card.

The other beauty of soccerlis that it re-
quires the peculiar combination of force
and ﬁnesse, power and playfulness, impro-
visation and instinct. For example,-a good
“through ball” or a forward pass that goes
past several defenders to its target requires
pinpoint accuracy, yet mustbe hard enough
to get through quickly.

A small tap of just a few feet might be fol-
lowed by a shot that is carefully.placed into an
area only a yard wide that is 18 yards away.

A good player has a sixth sense and a

rough idea of where 22 players are at all -'

times, and he might only have a split second
to move to one of them.

In short, those billion—plus people aren’t
foolish. With the sport catching on in the

‘ United States andwith the U.S. national
_ team’s strong performance, we can look for-

ward to less grumbling and more soccer. ,

MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

HeroesCon hoopla a superior comic convention

   

Oliver Bateman I Columnist

We hadn’t gone to a comic convention since
2006, but before that we went to them all the
time. It’s not that we liked spandex soap operas
or anything, because that would have meant we
were really nerdy and "pathetic. No, we went
because we were part of the hipster indieground

- —— whatever that means —— and we were obli-
gated to cover such things.

That’s right, we covered them all as serious
working members of the alternative press, in-
cluding the hugely popular Comic-Con in San
Diego.

Char1otte’s Heroes Convention is one of the
largest and longest—running independent comic

J conventions inAmerica. HeroesCon prides itself
on bringing togetherabunch of mainstream and
avant—garde comics creators without a lot of the
pop cultural foofaraw associated with massive
productions like Cornic-Con.

At this year’s convention, discussion pan-
els were hosted by industry insiders and, with
the exception 0 “30 Rock’s” Scott Adsit, the
show could boast of few celebrities from other
media.

Instead, HeroesCon focused on comics -

and in that respectwas quite satisfying. Among
other notables, Pittsburgh—based artistjim Rugg
was on hand to promote Afrodisiac, a blaxploi—
tation-inspired work that pays careful homage
to a variety of his creative inﬂuences.

Given the high quality of the small and inde-
pendent press material on display, we wasted
little time with better—known fare.

Featured guest Rob Liefeld — creator of
such titles as “X—Force,” “Youngblood,” and “Su—.
preme” — attracted long lines of adoring fans.
Since we had no desire to wait three hours to
shake hands with a manwho remains incapable
of drawingthem, we decidedtotake our business
elsewhere. Besides, we saw Liefeld several times
in the hotel ﬁtness center, where we did CrossFit
workouts and he did some routine that involved
quarter—motion movements with a dumbbell.

Liefeld distinguished himselfamong conven—
tion attendees partly because ofhis lack of mass.
Of the thousands who patrolled the convention
ﬂoor during HeroesCon’s three—day run, many

appearedtobewobblingontheirunsteadyland -

legs for the ﬁrst time inmonths. Pale, heavyset

men of indeterminate agewheeled around carts ,

containing boxes of action ﬁgures and comic
books. Quite a few engaged in multi—tasl<ing,
double—ﬁsting their nachos while negotiating
the price of a ﬁrst issue of “The Immortal Iron
Fist.” -

To our surprise, Liefeld wasn’t the only
person concerned with physical ﬁtness at He-
roesCon: Jamie Eason, full-time spokesmodel
for Bodybuildingcom, appeared in support
of an artist who sold airbrushed images of her
dressed up like Power Girl and various other
super heroes. We had no idea who she was, but
our traveling companion and de facto camera-
man informed us that she was some kind ofbig
shot in the exercise world.

Since Eason was at that point relatively un-
molested by fans — afact that struck us as odd,
given that tables staifed by elderly, unprepos-
sessing menwere drawing sizeable crowds —we
scored an exclusive interview. She demonstrated

g her deep understanding of real ﬁtness by know-

ing the components of various CrossFit work-
outs, then proceeded to tell us that we should
pursue a career in ﬁtness -modeling.

“Like we don’talread_ylmowthat”would have

been our elegant rejoinder ifwe were capableof
eitherelegance orarejoinder after several hours
spent wandering around 20,000 square feet of
comics paraphernalia.

Unfortimately, our interviewing skills had
become dull with disuse, and as a consequence,
we learned very little about what Eason actually
did. Bodybuilding.com is some kind of website
for and about bodybuilders, which was all the
research we were able to do on a tight deadline
like this one. We didn’t visit the site, though,
because this has been a really busy month for
us. Besides, what with the economy the way it
is, who has the time? -4‘

We had hoped that this column would captur
the essence ofHeroesCon, and nowwe realized
thatwe’ve succeeded. Allowus to summarize our
ﬁndings: There were some really good artists
there, as well as a bunch of obese people and
people in silly costumes. There weren’t as many
women as men. Finally, spokesmodeljamie Ea-
son was there and talked to us for a bit, which
was nice because we don’t get out as much as
we’d like anymore. '

 .lWayne Coyne, of the Flaming Lips, rides atop abear during the band’s concert at the Trib Total Media Amphitheatre on July 20, 2010.

Andy Tybout I Assistant A&E Editor ‘

Of all the acts to grace Pittsburgh
over the last few years, it’s a safe
bet that, before The Flaming Lips,
ﬁne had enlisted passing trains as
guest stars.

But during a July 20 perfor-

mance at the Amphitheatre at
Station Square, the ever—inventive
Lips did just that.
,3, Placing microphones along
the nearby tracks to create a bi-
zarre accompaniment to their hit-
tersweet psych-rock, it was, as is
always the case with the Oklahoma
quartet, strange, spontaneous and
somehow ﬁtting.

Lia’ The Pitt News called lead sing-
er Wayne Coyne before a show in
Lewiston, N.Y., to talk trains, art
and the meaning of life.

The Pitt News: Where did you
get the idea to set mics near the
gain? —

Wayne Coyne: (Laughs) Well,

you get the idea because there’s
a train going by all day, and I
thought, “Well, that never hap-
pens where there’s a train that
can be part of the show.” So I told
our engineers, “Let’s put some mi-
crophones out there and as it goes
by let’s see if it sounds like some-
thing.”  I think everybody that’s

~ at the show was kind of hoping that

we’d have a different thing than
just a normal concert or whatever.
I thought, “Maybe it’ll go by at a
time during the show where we
can all just sit there for a minute
and listen to this train.” You don’t
know if the train’s going to come
in 20 minutes or what. You don’t
know what’s really going to hap-
pen, but it ended up like a lot of
things: we took a chance — we do
that sometimes — and it worked
out pretty great. I thought it was
a great moment.

Conﬂict, culture and cuisine combine

Jamie Mrtina | Staff Photorapher

The Iranian front of the Kubideh Kitchen is the ﬁrstof many cultural facades the Conﬂict Kitchen will create when serving ethnic food-

Kubideh Kitchen

Open Sunday through Thursday from 11
a.m. to 2 p.m.

Open Friday and Saturday from 11 p.m.

ﬂu 3 a.m.

Located at the corner of Highland Avenue
and Baum Boulevard next to the Waffle
Shop ,
www.kubidehkitchen.com

‘when Kirs'ti Adkins drove down Baum Boule-

vard, something unusual caught her eye —— a
bright yellow and blue storefront with the
words “Kubideh Kitchen” written in Farsi,
the official. language of Iran.

“I was in Iran when I was in the Peace Corps ‘

a long time ago, so Iwas excited when I could
@ad the Farsi,” she said. “I really wanted an
Iranaian restaurant here in Pittsburgh.”

But Kubideh Kitchen is not exactly a res-
taurant. It’s a takeout storefront that special-
izes in a single Persian dish, the Kubideh
sandwich, which consists of homemade Bar-
bari bread, spiced ground beef —- or fried eg
for vegetarians, fresh basil, mint and onion.
Although the recipe is foreign, the ingredients
are locally grown.

Sharing some facilities with the Waffle
Shop, the kitchen opened in May 2010 as
an independent project of Jon Rubin, John
Peﬁa and Dawn Weleski with funding from
the Sprout Fund, the Waffle Shop and the
Center for Arts in Society.

' Rubin is a CMU professor who started
the Waffle Shop with students as part of an
art class called the Storefront Project. An
empty storefront sat next to the shop, so
Rubin joined his colleagues to brainstorm

\

possibilities for the empty space.

“We started a list of food that wasn’t avail-
able in Pittsburgh, such as Afghan food, Per-
sian food and Cuban food. Then we noticed
a lot of these countries fell into the category
of places the U.S. has some type of conﬂict
with,” Rubin said. ‘

So the group, dubbed the new project
“Conﬂict Kitchen,” starting with Iranian food
and planning to follow with Afghan, North
Korean and Venezuelan food in four—month
iterations. ' " A

Conﬂict Kitchen aims not only to intro-
duce fresh ﬂavors to Pittsburgh, but also to
engage the community in discussing issues
that might be unfamiliar.

The green, blue and yellow wrapper
around the Kubideh sandwich unfolds to
reveal quotes on topics from nuclear power

to fashion and ﬁlm. The quotes are compiled

from interviews with, local and foreign Ira-

nians. ’ .
Jasmine Friedrich, a undergraduate at

Carnegie Mellon, works at Kubideh Kitchen

through her work—study program. A

’ ' Alongwithmakingthe Kubidehsandwich,

Friedrich researches the food, culture and
visual identity of the kitchen’s next, iteration,
Afghanistan, which will premiere this fall.

She said she notices that some customers
only go for the food, whereas others also take
time to read the wrapper. "

“We have some people come that have ‘

been to the Middle East, or have strong opin-
ions about it. So sometimes we like to set up a
conversation between customers so they can
keep themselves occupied,” she said.

of the wrapper concerns Israel.

Many are surprised to learn that outside
of Israel, Iran has the largest population of
Jews in the Middle East.

None of the interviewees who are quoted
on the wrapper said they felt hostile toward
Jews, but rather, the political past of Israel.

“Some people are very passionate about
this viewpoint and see it as wrong or even
offensive,” Friedrich said.

With the help of technology, Kubideh
Kitchen already has people talking about
issues from beyond the sidewalk.

Using the Waffle Shop dining room, the
kitchen hosted two live Skype events in col-
laboration with the Sazmanab Project in

Tehran.

Injune, the kitchen invited the public to
an international virtual dinner party.
Guests sat down for a traditional Persian

meal across from Iranians in Tehran who .

were projected on a large screen connected
by webcam.

0 In_]uly, the kitchen presented a live screen-
ing called “The Tehranl Pittsburgh YouTube
Mix,” a back—and—forth discussion using only

YouTube videos about each cities’ unique
cultural phenomena.

Pittsburgh presented clips about Primanti
sandwiches, mullets and the G—2o protests,
whereas Tehran played videos of street food
vendors, banned haircuts and the 2009 elec-
tion protests. Guests were amazed by how
much the two cities had in common.

“People at the events are really surprised
at how tuned in Iranians are to not only the
culture in their region but American culture,
as well,” Rubin said. “About 70 percent of the
people in Iran are under age 30 and are a
young, progressive community of people.”

On Oct. 2, Pitt’s Persian student_organiza—
tion, the Persian Panthers, will hold a cul-
tural festival in» collaboration with Kubideh
Kitchen. V '

Activities will include a speaker from Iran,
a movie screening, music and» dance perfor-
mances, and Persian food. _ -

People might feel powerless in stopping
international disputes, but Conﬂict Kitchen
allows the Pittsburgh community to build
peace and cultural understanding one sand-
wich at a time.

Hot House

< Sprout 88 <

that are out there that they might not know
about,” Hannigan said. “You often hear the
complaint that there’s ‘nothing to do in
Pittsburgh,’ and while I agree that there’s,
very little that’s actually presented to peo-
ple outright, if you do a little searching
you’ll ﬁnd the right opportunities.” A
V In making Hot House both a unique
event and establishing its name in the com-
munity, the Sprout Fund has attempted to
use locations representative of new devel-
opment projects in Pittsburgh.

Previous spots have included Bakery

V Square in East Liberty and the Union Trust

Building Downtown.
. “We’re really excited about the location
for this year,” Hannigan said. “It’s at the

I intersection of Bloomﬁeld and Shadyside,

and that’s where a lot of exciting new things

.are occurring in the East End.”

Finding a space for an event the scope
of Hot House is not an easy task.

“Ideally, we want to partner with a devel-
opment or building owner that’s involved
in bringing something new to Pittsburgh,”

, Hannigan said. “Acquiring a spot can of-

ten be complicated, though. What tends

f to end up being very important is building
: a strong, productive relationship with the

property owners. We also try to choose a

axe-.‘aua~.s:.c~a»

is hoppin’

location that’s easily acc_essible through
public transportation.”

The Sprout Fund has also taken note of
the emerging growth of student Hot House
attendees in previous years. '

“When we ﬁrst started doing Hot House,
it took place in]une. Since we’ve moved it to
the end of August, the amount of students
and other young people who have come
out has grown tremendously,” Hannigan
said. “Last year, 500 of the advance tickets
were sold to students, so they’re deﬁnitely
becoming more of the crowd.”

In addition to providing tickets to stu-
dents for the discounted price of $25, the

, Sprout Fund also made it a point to offer

volunteer opportunities. ‘

“It’s a great way to get a free ticket,”
Hannigan said of volunteering. “There’s a
lot of work that goes into transforming a
vacant auto lot, and in the days and weeks
leading up to it, there will be a lot of work
occurring on site.”

Whether people experience Hot House
as volunteers or attendees, Hannigan feels
that one of the event’s greatest assets is
its presentation of what Pittsburgh has
to offer.

“It’s a way to see if this is the kind of city
where you’d like to settle down,” he said. I

As urban as Oakland may be, students
don’t have to leave campus to find 10-
cal fresh vegetables, fruits, meats and
baked goods. '

Every Friday at the Oakland Farmers
Market, local farmers and companies
work together to provide the freshest
and tastiest food within city limits.

“We offer all-natural beef, chicken and
pork each week,” a Mish Farms employee
said. All—nat_ural means no hormones,
steroids or antibiotics were added to the
Mish Farms raised animals. ' .

’ The vendor also provides customers
with a homemade hot meat dish, includ-
ing buffalo chicken and barbecue chicken.
and beef. ' ‘

When you’ve had your protein fill for
the day, the farmers’ market also offers
sugary options to satisfy your sweet
tooth. ' '

Sand Hill Berries provides these treats.
A family— owned business, this vendor ope
erates a small fruit farm in southwestern

< Flaming Lips 88 <

And I was singing a lot about my own experi-
ences and death. [It was] sort of a bleaker
version of music — not bleak in that it’s bad,
but speaking openly and seriously about
emotions and death.

And a lot of people liked these records

that we did. And we would go out and play,

but I knew that we were going to be singing ,

songs about death. And I was 35 or 36 years
old at the time, and I was singing something
to give [the audience] perspective. And I
thought perhaps a lot of the audience would
be hearing about this and complaining to
people that are 20 years old — ona Saturday
night, they’re taking ecstasy — and here I
am, this older guy, singing about death.

' And I thought, “If we’re going to sing
about death, we’re going to have to make
this look like a f*cking party.” So it’s my idea
that the more I sing to you about what death
means, the more you’ll understand what life
means. That was the reason I wanted to do

Daaé than what appears, yet she
naively continues on with their les-
sons, all the while falling in love
with another man.

The Phantom wreaks havoc on
the opera house and the lives of the
performers on his zealous quest for
Christine’s heart and commitment.
The story reaches its climax when
the Phantom steals Christine away
and forces her to decide the out-
come of her life and of the story:
Stay with the Phantom forever or
live without her true love, who will
be killed at the hand of the Phan-
tom.

The Paris Opera House is a real
place and has been around since the
end of the 19th century.

opera house would testify that it

FILM

Glimmer of hope for f1lm

Andy Tybout I Columnist

If each summer movie season was
itself made into a movie, it’s a safe
bet critics would harangue 2010
as a crass sequel to 2009.

In fact, that’s exactly what they V

did. As Dave McGinn of the Globe
and Mail said of his day at the
movie theater, “I was despairing
for this summer’s crop of mov-
ies. Nothing yet had that sense
of wonder. or truly mindless joy
that the best popcornmovies of-.
fer.” Cable news organizations like
CNN echoed his sentiment.

I, however, resent this sort of
Debbie downerism. I, for one, be-
lieve —- or would liketo. believe
— this summer will go down as
the start of a cinematic renais-
sance. So, to reassure myself, I’ve
compiled the three following ex-
amples — promising signs sure
to send 2010 naysayers back to
the dank cave of pessimism from
which they came.

A Promising Blockbuster: “In-

xlb

ception”

Every summer, critics bemoan
the heap of tentpole blockbust-
ers that fail to achieve anything
besides box office sales —— ﬁlms
that, in their view, perpetuate a
safe and stupid Hollywood cycle.
By the same token, there are one
or two blockbusters each year that
critics elevate to the status of fear-
less trailblazer. This year,"‘Incep—
tion” was that poster child.

V ‘ Perhaps with good reason —
the ﬁlm, for all its explosions,
doesn’t insult an audience’s in-
telligence and toys with ideas

more complex than 10 Bond ﬁlms -

combined. Additionally, the script
is 100 percent original — an in-
creasingly rare thing in today’s
franchise—happy environment.
Most importantly —— and the value
of this cannot be overstated --
“Inception” made $100 million in
its opening week. Enough money,
critics hoped, to send dumb ﬁlms

packing.
Whether or not this dream
will actually come to fruition,
this much is clear: “Inception”_ I
proved audiences will see a ﬁl"‘r"ri"’
that makes them think. Although
it’s unlikely to spur another gold-
en age, it’s nice, nonetheless, to
hope against hope that after more
than 100 years of cinema, “Incep-
tion” will ﬁnally be the movie to
jar producers into valuing quality '
over safe cash once and for all.
A Promising Trend: Netﬂix
Watch Instantly V
Over the summer, Netﬂix’s
movie streaming service led t
charge in quality online viewing; i
sure, the service costs a bit of
money, but compared to the il-
legal downloads laden with more
viruses than a slum’s water supply,
this isn’t asking a great deal.
Among the great titles I saw
this summer without leaving my
room: “Oldboy,” “Touching the

Bright spots of

-the summer

 season 97 -:2

Void,” “Breathless,” “Solaris,”
4'-iéurosawa’s “Dreams,” “It Might

Get Loud,” “Moon” and of course,

“Chappelle’s Show.”

Of course, watching movies in-
stantly isn’t new to 2010, but this
year the service’s lineup increased
so substantially that I give it the
prestigious Andy Tybout stamp
of approval.

Promising News: Bill Murray is
Still Classy, Just Absent-Minded

About midway through “Zom—
bieland,” Bill Murray, playing

-la-imself, is asked if he has any

regrets. “Well,” he says, “Maybe
‘Garﬁeld.’”

I couldn’t agree more.

But don’t worry, Murray fans:
the fat, orange blemish on Bill’s
impeccable_resume was all just a
big misunderstanding. In a recent

interview with GQ, Murray said '

he signed up to voice the deadpan
cat becausehe saw the name “Joel
Coen” on the script. Only, it wasn’t

that Joel Coen. Honest mistake.
This, of course, doesn’t exactly
explain the second cinematic
genocide, “Garﬁeld: A Tail of Two
Kitties,” which also featured Mur-
ray, but who knows? Maybe a guy
named Ethan Coen wrote it.

So there you have it: proof that
this summer was simply packed
full of good news. Now, I could
talk about Michael Bay’s upcom-
ing production of “Hansel and

Gretel,” for instance, or the mad— ‘

deningly diverse spectrum of new
and upcoming 3-D ﬁlms (“Hansel
and Gretel” among them), or my
unshakable gut feeling that 2011
will only employ more washed-up
superheroes and more Bowﬂex-
trained vampires, but these points
would only dampen the enthusi-
asm I’ve just built up.

Instead, like Michael Bay, I’d
prefer to stick to my guns. This
summer has been good. Trust
me. 

FOOD

Pittsburgh foods
wrapped up in history

Sarah Simkin I Columnist

Fries on a sandwich, steel, sports,
riots and sports-related riots are
all Pittsburgh—y —- Pittsburgh-
esque if you will — but you can
alwaysyfind them elsewhere.
However, I dare you to ﬁnd an-
other city that has so artfully
contrived to pack more carbo-
hydrates into a sandwich.

If 'you’re new to our fine city
(welcome!), the inclusion of fries
might initially seem like an odd
practice, but after an experience
or two, I think you’ll find it, if not
charming, at least admirable in
its. practicality and possibility.

Legend — meaning the Pri-
manti Brothers website —— has
it that the tradition started in
the 19305, when an‘ attempt to

determine if a shipment of pota-
t_oes was frozen led to some tasty
looking fries sizzling away on
the grill next to the sandwiches.
Sandwich-seeking patrons were
intrigued, so the enterprisingjoe
Primanti combined the two. His-
tory was made.

Sure, you might say, that trick
was all well and good in the pre-
Cold War era, but is it still effec-
tive today? Of course it is — per-
haps more so now than ever.

In our hustle and bustle world, I

who has time to sit down for a
multi-part meal? The sprint be-
tween classes, jobs and other
commitments can leave one with
scant time to grab an energy bar
or a yogurt, let alone something

with a side dish that requires
additional eating time. By com-
bining the side of fries with the
entree, one can cleverly reduce
the intrusiveness of lunch‘.

To experience this innovation
firsthand, seek out the original
recipe — branches of Primanti
Brothers‘ can be found in several
convenient locations, including
in central Oakland on Forbes Av-
enue, in the Strip District and
the South Side. You could even
enjoy’ a fry-laden sandwich dur-
ing a game at Heinz Field or PNC

Molly 'Green| Columnist

.

Every fall, major television networks conjure
up several dozen new series —- half of which
will fail abysmally, some of which, despite
being redundant crap, will do marvelously

combination of being both novel and well-
produced.

This new season is heavy on crime dra-
mas and romantic-comedy sitcoms, which
are, incidentally, my two least favorite, and
probably the most over-worked, genres of
television. Many of the shows are more of the
same, while others are uniquely atrocious.
There are, however, a few promising gems
to look forward to. A .

ABC: ' ‘ V

 ABC — the so—called network of “drama”
-1 will be premiering several medical dra-
mas (surprise, surprise), three sit—coms and
two slightly more original dramas, none of
which look to be a life—altering television
experience. . _ .

‘f’ The good: The most intriguing of ABC’s
new line-up is deﬁnitely “No Ordinary Fam-
ily,” which is basically the live-action, TV

   

well, and a few that will achieve the rare '

version of the movie “The Incredibles.” It
even stars Michael Chiklis as the newly su-
per—powered family’s patriarch. If the show’s
writing is smart and it can combine family
drama with science-ﬁction in a satisfying
way, this could be a show to watch.

The bad: If ABC loves anything, it’s un-
realistic medical dramas and reviving the
careers of middle-aged has-been actresses.
It’s no doubt, then, that the network couldn’t
wait to get its greedy little hands on “Body
of Proof,” which stars Dana Delaney as an
oh-so-sassy, top-of-her-field neurosurgeon-
turned—medical examiner, who is forced
to reevaluate her life after a “devastating”
car crash. While Delaney is a good actress,
the show is basically an extended Lifetime
movie. I’ll pass. -

And the Shonda: The network is, of
course, also premiering its new Shonda
Rhimes drama, “Off the Map,” which ap-
pears to be “Grey’s Anatomy” meets Doc-
tors Without Borders. At ﬁrst glance, the
show looks innocuous enough, but I know

Rhimes too well and can only assume that it _

will be riddled with angsty monologues and
dialogue somewhere along the lines of: “I am
here to help people. People. Those people
there. Who are dying every day. Every day!”
Good for drinking games and mindless TV
viewing.
NBC: 2

Personally,  think NBC has the strongest

showing of new shows, though the network’s
record for producing new, quality dramas
has been dubious as of late. Still, most of its
upcoming series have refreshing unique-
ness, which — admittedly — could also be
their downfall. "

The good: NBC has three new dramas
worth mentioning, but I’m most excited
about “The Cape.” Think “Batman” meets
“Sin City” meets the circus. Everything
about it — the plot, the style of ﬁlming, the
characters, the special effects — looks really
cool. The story chronicles a cop framed for a

. crime he did not commit, taken in by circus

folk and trained to defend himself/ﬁght cor-
ruption under a super—hero-like alias: The

.Cape. Other notables are government—con-

Fall television   lineup broken down

spiracy drama “The Event” andJ.J. Abrams’
new spy drama, “The Undercovers.”

The bad: “Love Bites,” a show dedicated’
to telling various women’s tales of dating
woes. It’s what I call an “Erin show,” so
named for my sister, who has a strange taste
for Hallmark made-for-TV movies and Amy
Adams chick ﬂicks.

And the sequel: “Law & Order: Los An-
ge1es.” Really? Another one?

Fox: ' ‘T

Fox produced a mixed bag of really-
freaking-sweet dramas and awful —— just
awful — sitcoms. ‘

The good: “Lonestar” is the story of a
Texas conman who is leading a double-life"“’
and romancing a different woman in each
one. The combination of deceitlwith genuine
affection for the two leading ladies should
produce interesting conﬂict and, hopefully,
some great television. . .

The bad: “Bob’s Burgers” is the animated
comedy from Fox. As it centers about a fam-
ily-owned burger joint, I have to assume this
will be in the same vein as “Family Guy” and

It’s nice to get produce from such close

§3_r5- It’s rare that I like a show on CBS. I feel

asking about retail space in the area, but
it wasn’t available and was pretty run

p After an eight-year stint at Paul’s CDs
in Bloomfield, Seamans took his cues
from the record stores of Washington,
D.C., where he had lived for several
years. _

“The stores were a lot smaller there,”
he said. “It seemed like what they carried

“I’ve seen a lot of familiar faces from
Paul’s [CDs] and local shows,” he said.
“I’ve also seen a lot of new collectors,

When it comes to vinyl’s future pros-

“They’re about higher sound quality and

Redemption is dead on awesome

Patrick Wa ner I Staff Writer

“Red Dead Redemption”
Rockstar Games
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

Gunman John Marston is a dying
breed of man.
Quick with his pistol and wearing

A his hatred of authority like a French

cuff on the edge of his musty sleeve,
Marston’s antihero persona is reﬂec—
tive of the rough—and—tumble Unitied
States of 1911. ‘

Behind a long, sun-baked hori-
zon an eternity of revolutionaries,
whores, drug peddlers and plain—old
killers surround him as he seeks a

' second chance with his sidearm.

He is —’ in case you'couldn’t ﬁg-
ure it out — the bounty hunter pro-

tagonist of this summer’s video game ._

of note, “Red Dead Redemption.”
In Marston’s tale of moral ambi~
guity, Rockstar Games — renowned
for its similarly free—form “Grand
Theft Auto” series — has created
not only one of the greatest gaming
experiences to ever grace a console,

. but also demonstrated the art’s abil-

ity to be an emotionally mature ex-

perience.

Marston’s M-rated escapades
run the gamut from his own tale of
betrayal and violence to random
encounters with “strangers” who
require his considerable skills, all
the while navigating an imrnersive
Western environment teemingwith
banditos, outlaws and dangerous
wild animals.

This impressive array of content
could sell by itself in this era of un-
abashed video game violence, but
with an option to do good or bad
—— to forge one’s own moral path —
the experience becomes much more
complex.

For instance, when the moment
of death comes to one of Marston’s

more formidable bounty targets, the '

player is faced with a choice: He may
either end the man’s life or allow Mar-
ston’s honor to take over — resulting
in the man’s death at the hands of
Mexican revolutionaries.

These actions have reactions,
and, although “Grand Theft Aut ”—
style killing sprees are possible, the
true object of the game lies in the

emotionally wracked complexity of
both the heroes and villains in the
game’s story line, any fan of the West-
ern genre can see that Marston is
far more complex than your average
poncho—wearing maniac. The game’s
heroes and villains often do contra-
dictory things and, above all, act as
humanely as any movie character

might.

The Wild West isnot just one idea..-

— it’s a series of conﬂicting issues,
people, places and things as vast as
the real America they reﬂect. Though
the concept of a free-roaming west-
em— killing andall — might sound
like the last thing video games need
to be considered art, the complex and
entertaining experience of “Red Dead
Redemption” proves that interactive
entertainment is emerging as -5- pun
intended — a new frontier. .

The way Graysees it, cupcakes are ablank

For Dozen bakers, the art lies in the taste,
not the packaging. ‘

“The cupcakes are very classic. We use
simple but high~quality ingredients. That is
the recipe to success,” Bielski-Braham said.
‘‘Plus, we .do simple but beautiful swirls of
buttercream on the cupcakes. Nothing is
«better than fresh buttercream.”

Inspired creations include the Cosmo, V

worry because the alcohol burns off in the
baking process. Dozen also offers vegan cup-

Of the ingredients, Bielski-Braham said
Dozen bakers pride themselves on using
only ones that are high quality and locally
grown. ' T

“James [Gray] is passionate about local,
sustainable food —— supporting local farms
and vendors, such as GIVE water and Com-

ingredients, such as Guittard chocolate,”

bakers make sure to offer a variety of des-
serts, as well as soups, sandwiches, an as-
sortment of coffee, teas and other drinks
and a special brunch on Sundays at the Law-

Bielski-Braham said Dozen looks forward
to the move to Oakland, which will bring the
business closer to the college students who
form its target market. The opening will al-

“Oakland is a great location for Dozen.

Kennywood
4800 Kennywood Boulevard

I wwest Mifﬂi_n, PA 15122

412-461-0500 or kennywood.com

When Pitt student Mike Cherpak heads
to work every day, he can look forward to
a calming day of work, even if "everyone
around him is screaming. After working

at Kennywood for six years, Cherpak —— a
Pittsburgh local and Pitt junior — has a
good idea about how Kennywood works,
at least in terms of park maintenance. He
supervises the amusement park—clean up.
He said his department offers a laid-back
work environment and that the daily simi-
lar clean—up routine is also “very calm-
mg.”

But wait: what is Kennywood? Put sim-
ply, it’s something all Pittsburgh locals
know about. It’s actually a bit like the Steel-
ers — if you live here, you better love it.

Entering its 113th season of operation,
Kennywood has been around since 1898.
While the park doesn’t release speciﬁc at-
tendance ﬁgures, 2.1 million people total
visit Kennywood or one of its local sist:er
parks, Idlewild and Sandcastle annually,
according to public relations spokesperson
Jeff Filicko. ' ‘ _ . ,4 

According to their website, the 
burgh Kennywood amusement park was

founded by a railway company, in essence _ p

giving the transportation system extra, in-
come  trolleys would take people to the
amusement park and the company overall
would make extra money. .
But by 1902 the company was tired pf
operating Kennywood. ', ;
They sold Kennywood to new owners,
and over the last century the park changed
hands and expanded to include new rides
for all ages. ' p 1
Today it still stands as a “traditional
amusement park” even as it adapts to the
21st century, according to the Kennywood
website.. ~ g . _ '
“We’re not your mega-plastic’, metal-
everywhere park,” Filicko said, explaining
that Kennywood visitors can ride the “best
blend of rides” from metal and wooden
coasters to water rides, down to a very
slow historical train ride. ‘ _ 
Visitors can also bring picnic baskets
andieat at picnic tables in parts of the par ,
or they can purchase typical amusemeifat
park foods. A 
Kennywood recently underwent a ' -
other ownership change, but Filicko does
not feel this hasaffected the park. _
“The main difference is the new owner-
ship structure tends to be on the businéss
aspect,” Filicko said. “The main reas_ 11
they bought us was they liked the park and
the way we ran, so they’re more conte t

to let us run as usual and make changes to

the business aspect of things.”

wood. . i

Filicko said every ride goes through*a
saftey inspection and has to be signed f
before it’s open to the public.The safety
inspection process seems to work; Kenny-
wood’s last publicized accident was caused
by bad weather in 2002, when the roof olia
ride calledAThe Whip collapsed. One woman
was killed. No rides with found problenis
open, meaning the most harm that comes

to guestsis frustration when-a favorite ride ‘

closes for a day. _ _

of our residencies.” —
The writers are free to relocate elsewhere
at the end of their Pittsburgh residency, but
ﬁleese said he hopes the roots they establish
, ‘ ‘in the Pittsburgh community will inspire them
to stay in the Steel City and continue to enrich
Pittsburgh’s literary scene.
 Just as‘ the pavement of Sampsonia Way
jprovides physical shelter for the exiled writ—

    

fers, Sampsonia Way, the Web magazine, aims
lﬁto provide shelter for their writing and to

l  arner awareness for their plight.
 ’ “The magazine became an offshoot of [the
“exiled writers program] to extend that mis-
sion into the larger world and at the same
"time bring the world to us on Sampsonia Way,”

d "Reese said. .

 Full issues of the Sampsonia Way maga
zifie are published online every two months,
with other updates and articles added to the

V "ii}vebsite daily.

Reese said the goal of the magazine is to

‘_ “increase public awareness of the situations

in countries that threaten freedom of speech.

' i?The magazine’s content is primarily editorials

:' ‘examining political situations endangering
alree speech, but Reese said the magazine is
“still ﬁnding its way” and might expand to
"include other forms of writing. '
The magazine features writers in the pro-

>~r

  
  

 

  Sampsonia a home for arts

~ gram and their peersaround the country, as

well as writers from around the world with
the intent to articulate their mission and gain

exposure for endangered writers on a global ‘

scale, as well as a local one.

Pittsburgh’s universities have played an
important role in Sampsonia Way’s success.

Reese said Pitt has been “just terriﬁc” and
was honored in 2005 with the Protecting
Endangered Voices Award in recognition of
the University’s support for the program.
Exiled writers have taught creative writing
courses and participated in readings at Pitt,
and the Pitt Arts program has also brought
undergraduate students to Sampsonia Way
events.

Sampsonia Way’s next big event will be a
free jazz concert and poetry reading on Sept.
11. More than 700 people are expected to ﬁll

, the 20—feet—wide alley for an evening of music

and readings from.around the world, followed
by a dance party ﬁmdraising event.

Another program, Writers in the Garden,
will go on that afternoon and involve a walk-
ing tour of the neighborhood with stops in
private gardens for poetry readings.

Reese said he hopes to build a literary
center near Sampsonia Way featuring a book
store, reading space and café within the next
year. '

trash pick—up, as well as maintaining the
picnic grounds.

He begins his work shift around 11:30
a.m. and, depending on how late the
crowds stay, does not go home until 10
or 11 p.m.

The shifts are very similar and not very
exciting, he said.

When he’s not on the clock, he can
ride whatever he wants in the park, and
he definitely recommends certain things
to all first-time visiting students.

“The obvious answer for what [Pitt
students] should eat is the Potato Patch
Fries,” Cherpak said.

He also recommended the Phantomfs
Revenge coaster ride as a must; but he
added that the new Kennywood coaster
might be better. He hasn’t had the chance
to ride’ it yet.

The Sky Rocket is “ little bit different”
from a traditional coaster, Filicko said.
Instead of the coaster “clicking” its "way
up a hill on a chain, Sky Rocket is literally
launched up a hill from its station and up

 
    
      
     

a starting hill

The ride is “about 65 seconds long,
which seems short, but is every bit as long
as the Phantom,” Filicko said.

Cherpak will continue to work at Ken—
nywood during the fall, when the park
hosts its annual Phantom Fright Nights.
Deals directed at college students are easi-
est to find during the fall, but Kennywood
bargain tickets are available now, too.

“Typically at any given time there are
multiple discounts for Kennywood,” Fil-
icko said. “Our college discounts tend

to appear toward Fright Nights, as iris“

more conducive to when students are
around.”

With a new ride in its ﬂeet, Kennywood
Park might not have anything new oc-
curring right away — but if history says
anything, there will be more changes soon
enoughat the park.

“There’s nothing deﬁnite yet for future
plans, but consistently we tend to open
new rides or bring back a classic ride,”
Filicko said.

Putting slightly tweaked scenes from

So for any other series, I would bash thif‘

Best of Summer: Gaslight

~91!’-Kelsey Shea I Contributing Editor

A lot of contemporary bands try to mimic
an older vein of music, and sadly, it usually
~ doesn’t work.

But for The Gaslight Anthem, it’s
Q5;-vhere thesejersey Boys have found their

niche.
The band’s second album‘ American
Slang sticks to the band’s fast and energetic
pace without sacriﬁcing the classic Bruce
Springsteen-style rock that helped. The

Gaslight Anthem make a name for itself
on its popular album, The ’59 Sound.

It might be Brian Fallon’s fantastic lead
vocals or Benny Horowitz’s crazy fast
drumming that sets The Gaslight Anthem
apart from other nostalgic rockers, but
it’s also the jarring honesty in the band’s
Americana lyrics and earnestness. A

Like The ’59 Sound before it, American
Slang is the kind of album that makes lis-

teners want todrive fast and enjoyvbein
a young 20—something. ‘
Though American Slang is still ener-
T getic and powerful, some of the songs
seem to have slightly lower ﬁdelity, and
the entire album is only slightly mellower
than The .’59 Sound. - '
One of the highlights of thealbum are
its title song, “American Slang,” which is

a dramatic and fast yet somehow nearly ,

This tale of super—villain—turned-softie ‘i
was good, but not great, When sized up

against the animated greats, it doesn’t

have the perfectly paced plot or nuanced
writing of former genre triumphs like ‘

hilarious, with much of the humor
coming from the character Agnes" (Elsie

Combining “Pulp Fiction,” “Penrose

Describing The Avett Brothers as energetic
is an understatement.
The band’s spirited genre, inﬂuenced

‘by bluegrass, aggressive folk, emotive alt-

country and rockabilly punk leaves little
to be desired. *
Comprised of brothers Scott and Seth
Avett, who play the banjo and guitar respec-
tively, bassist Bob Crawford and cellistjoe

Kwon, the group brought its act to the Ches-
A—Rena this Sunday.

No strangers to Pittsburgh, The Avett.

Brothers played at the Carnegie Music Hall
of Homestead lastjune and have made two
prior appearances at the Three Rivers Arts
Festival. Sunday’s show was a thrilling ride,
leaving the huge crowd thoroughly satis-
ﬁed.

Though the punishing heat and low ceil-V

Linebackers’ coach making animpact

Alex Oltmanns I Sports Editor

"When the Pitt football team goes up against
the University of Miami on Sept. 23 this
season, Bernard Clark will see a familiar
face and logo on the opposite sideline.

Clark, in his ﬁrst season as the Pan-

. thers linebackers’ coach, will look across

crthat sideline and see former Miami team-

. mate and current Hurricanes coach Randy
Shannon. .

“It’s going to be very weird, probably
as weird as when I was at [Florida Inter-
, national University] and we played them. I

I ._had to look across the ﬁeld and got dressed
in the visitors’ locker_room,” Clark said.
“But it’ll be weird seeing Randy, especially
since we played side by side and now I’m

I seeing him across the ﬁeld.” _
It was at Miami where Clark ﬁrst made
. a name for himself as a key contributor at
élinebacker on two national championship
teams in 1987 and 1989. I

‘He came up big in the 1988 Orange
Bowl as well as when he made 14 tackles
on his way to being named the MVP of

I the game.

Now Clark is hoping to bring that suc-
cess to Pitt’s linebacker corps.

“I think it’s important
that if you’re asking a
guy to do’ soI_nething,x '
you have to be able to
do it also.” '

-- Bernard Clark |

Coming to Pitt after serving most re-
cently as the defensive coordinator at
Hampton~University, he_ instantly made

  

animpression in spring practices with
his intense demeanor and coaching style.
He even showed the players how to do
drills ﬁrsthand when he took on a block-
ing sled. I ,

By taking these drills to the next level,
Clark believes it makes an impression on

' the players.

‘ — »“I think it’s important that if you’re ask-

I ’ ing a guy to do something, you have to be

able to do it‘also,’i Clark said. “When the

‘I fplayers see that, I think they understand

what I’m talking about. I always tell them,

I '-_“":if-.I’m 43 and can do it, you deﬁnitely should

= able to doit.”

-  The Panther linebackers readily em-
' _ fl_5r-aced Clark’s philosophies, and the fact
 he played linebacker at the highest
‘ level .himself, playing three seasons in the I
 gives him instant credibility with
 players.

Sunseri
ready to

step upl

V Lauren Kirschman I Senior Staff Writer ‘

Tino Sunseri doesn’t have much game ex-
perience at the college level. In fact, he
appeared in only five games forthe Pitt

* football, team last ‘season.

‘But'tIhe redshirtsophomore is making
it clear thathe’s ready to step in as the

_' starting quarterback'and lead the Panther

offense into the 2010 season. ‘

“I don’t need baby steps,” he said. “I
don’t think leaders are made overnight.
I think it’s something that you have to be
ready for whenever you’re young, and you
kind of just step into it.”-

That’s a good thing, too, since the Pan-
thers won’t have the chance to ease into
the season. Pitt’s ﬁrst game comes against
No. 24 Utah, and the team faces Miamion
Sept. 23. Sunseri isn’t shying away from
the high level of competition early in; the
season, saying that every quarterback “has
to start somewhere.” V . '

For Sunseri, his career started behind
departed senior Bill Stull, whom Sunseri

will replace under center this season. Stull’s I

senior season won’t be an easy act to fol-
low. He led the Panthers toa 10-3 record,
their best season since 1981, andearned a
spot on the All-Big East First Team. I
Sunseri said he took advantage of the
opportunity to learn from Stull’s junior
season when he struggled to his standout
senior year. - 3,
“Bill was one of those guys you could
learn a ton from, because he’s been from
the lows to the‘ highs,” Sunseri said.;_“I

was always right there in the meetings .

and made sure‘ I was the ﬁrst person. he
talked to whenever he came off [the ﬁeld].

‘There was aguy that was doing it,
_I* wasn’t actually doing‘ it, but I waségthe

closest thing to it.’? _»

- Pitt offensive coordinator Frank ’

Cignetti-, Jr. said that Sunseri’s opportunity

to watch and learn from Stullis the kirrd ;
of experience that helps a quarterbackaatg ‘

any level.

Former Miami star ready to

 coach against

 < Clark 118 <:

“He played linebacker, so it just helps,

 you want to work harder too, knowing
I that you have somebody that played your
position and understands what you need
to do to become a better player,” junior
linebacker Greg Williams said.‘

Clark came in right away, sat his play-
ers down to look at ﬁlm and pointed out
things that each one could do to get better,
and one aspect he has been harping on is
missed tackles.

3 “He pointed out a lot of missed tack-
les that I should’ve made,” Williams said.

“Even during practice he hates missed

tackles and gets on us about everything.”
 .One of the biggest things that Clark
 ‘believes breeds better players is compe-
 .:,tition. It’s the thing that he credits a lot
 of Miami’s success to when he was there,
» :.when one great linebacker after another
' ‘would step up when his predecessor left

  
 

 [the team, like Winston Moss, Jessie Arm- ‘

"< Lstead, Dan Morgan and Ray Lewis, just to
name a few.
Now Clark is hoping that the same type

j Dim,—é—In _i_:.'3i~.'.(.’~(,)Ll‘: (.)nly

of competition breeds success at Pitt.
“It wasn’t just tradition, it was the com-
- petition level more than anything else,”
Clark said of his time at Miami. “When you
create a competition, that’s when you cre-
ate great players. I think that’s what we’ve
created here with our linebacker corps.”
The Panthers are .set at two linebacker
spots with sophomore Dan Mason and
junior Max Gruder, but neither one has
shown any signs of complacency.
Williams is in a competition for the oth-
er starting spot with fellow junior Tristan
Roberts, and other players, like Shane
Gordon, Carl Fleming, Manny Williams
and Joe Trebitz, provide strong_con1peti-
tion as well. .

“We have guys behind those starters
that are going to push them, Clark said.
“Guys are going to make sure,they’re doing
their best because if they don’t get it done,
guys are going to step in.”

No matter who plays, one thing is for
sure: Clark will have his players ready for
the season opener against Utah. E

their own locker rooms for when they play
games.at the new arena.

Pitt’s room has a small changing area
and a larger meeting room with blue car-
pet and gold walls. This is just one of the
nuances that make Consol Energy Center
one of the most unique arenas in the coun-
try. Sure, it was built for hockey, but Tom
McMillan, vice president of communica-
tions for the Penguins, said that hockey
games will only account for about half the
arena’s events.

It hasn’t even opened yet, and there are
already 15 non-hockey events planned,
including some of the biggest acts in music

3‘

such as Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, George
Strait and an inaugural pair of concerts
by Paul McCartney.

McMillan said that some of those tours
would have passed over Pittsburgh in the
past because Mellon Arena couldn’t handle
it.

The ﬁrst thing you notice when enter-
ing the bowl of the arena is the gigantic
center scoreboard. The screen of the Jum-
boTron is bigger than the entire score-
board at the Igloo. I

“That’s because the roof at Mellon
Arena couldn’t hold any more weight,”
McMillan’ said.’ “That’s’ why Mellon is the
only building of its kind. Nobody wanted
to build another roof like that because it
couldn’t hold much weight.”

When the Igloo was built in 1961, con-
certs just plugged into electricity and that
was it, McMillan said.

Goalkeeper looking to lead

team again this season 

Lauren Kirschman I Senior Staﬂ? Writer

The ﬁrst time Morie Kephart started as

goalkeeper for Pitt’s soccer team, she was .

so nervous she was shaking.

Now, she’s a leader for Pitt’s defense,
“the level headin the back,” as she calls
it, and one ofthe top goalkeepers in the
country. ‘ p "

Kephart leads,,Division I goalkeepers
with a .926 save percentage on a Pitt de-
fense that allowed only 11 goals last sea-
son, tying for ﬁrst in the Big East.

She set several school records during
her years at Pitt, including most shutouts
in a season (8), most career shutouts (13)

Wand 1east~career»goals- allowed-(39).;How.-W-..

ever, Kephart quickly pointed out that the
achievements were not hers alone.

_ ‘flt wasn’t just my success,” Kephart
said. “We had a really cohesive defensive
line and defensive unit. The back line had
been together two or three years total. It
was just something that clicked.”

That backﬁeld consisted of Kat Weiler,
Maura Caslin, Rebecca Fraser and _Abby
Baldys. -Weiler —— who is also Kephart’s

~ roommate e and Baldys both return this

season. ,

Kepart said that a lot of credit‘ goes to
the defense for preventing the opponent
fromngetting good shots off.

“Most of the shots that I got were fairly
easy to save,” Kephart said. “I only had
one or two games where I had to make a
lot of tough saves.”

Despite her success last season, Kephart
said there are always ways for her to im-
prove her game. She said she’ll continue
to work hard on her game individually in

order to get bigger and stronger heading-

into this season.
Although she has personal goals for her

senior season, such as allowing no more

than 10 goals, her main goals focus on the
team. She wants to go far in the Big East

tournament and receive a bid to the NCAA I

Tournament.

_“I could have the worst season of my
life, but as long as the team succeeds, I
would be happy,” she said.

Kephart’s journey to Pitt is one rooted
in legacy. Both of her parents, grandpar-
ents and great grandparents attended the
University. So although she looked at other
schools, she decided to attend Pitt -—— even
though she wasn’t sure she had a spot on
the team right away.

The Panthers were recruiting a goalie
for her year, Kephart said, but that even-
tually fell through. Kephart was accepted
to Pitt at the end of her junior year and,
in the winter, decided she was going to

' 3.'§;ag.'~

attend Pitt whether or not there wasja
place on the team. _ . 

Pitt head coach Sue-Moy Chin called
Kephart in March to offer her a spot that
opened on the squad. Although" Chin had
never seen Kephart play, Kephart played
for one of the assistants in the past, and
Chin trusted her judgment. _ - 

“Everythingjust kind of fell into place
after that,” Kephart said.

I Kephart chose a health and physical ac-
tivity major, at Pitt, hoping to keep soccer

to coach, saying she would like to start at

..the.,club. leveland maybe even_tu,a,l__ly&b_e—

come a college coach. She’s also looking at
becoming a personal trainer or astrength
and conditioning coach. .

She came to Pittsburgh from State Col-
lege, and although she said there was a
transition moving from the country to the
city, she always considered Pittsburgh a
second home. ’

Kephart played in Pittsburgh for club
soccer, and she has family in the city, so
she spent a lot of time in Pittsburgh grow-
ing up. _ I 

“It also helps to have a team with you,”
she said. “You have automatic friends and
that makes the adjustment a lot easier.”

e That bond with her teammates helped
her grow as a goalie throughout the years,
because she knows how they play and what

. to expect.

As she heads into her ﬁnal year as a
Panther, Kephart said there are many
things she’s improved upon since begin-
ning on the field as a nervous freshman.

“The experience helped me tremen-
dously,” she said. “I’m more knowledge-
able. I’m more explosive. I’ve become fast-
er and stronger overall. My organization
skills have gotten a lot better. With an
organized defense, the other team gets
half as many shots.” *

In order to organize the defense,
Kephart said that she tries to keep every-
one calm around her. '

“I do play with a lot of emotion,” she
said.’ “If I wouldn’t play with emotion, I
wouldn’t be the player I am. But being a
goalie, you have to keep everyone’s emo-
tions running low around you.”

She said she tries to be a leader in
everything she does, and especially this
season, she wants to step up and lead the
team no matter what- ' A

“It’s my senior year and it’ll probably

be one of the last times I play competitive

soccer,” she said. “I want to leave every-
thing on the fields. No regrets.” I

MEN’S SOCCER

Seniors Succeed
on and off the field

_ Kelly Flanigan I Staff Writer

Hard work has paid off for Pitt soc-
cer seniors Andy Kalas andjustin
Boehm, not just on the ﬁeld, but
in the classroom, as well.

This year, they were named to 4

Pitt’s list of 4.0 Scholar Athletes.

“Time management is really
key for me. There is never a down
minute,” Kalas said regarding his
abilities to juggle his accounting
major, as well as the demands of
being a Division I athlete.

As a partial result of their ef-
forts, the team won the Top Men’s
Academic award at the Student-
Athlete Award Breakfast with a
collective 3.08 GPA, and the team
is hoping to collect more awards
this year from their play on the
ﬁeld.

Kalas, a defender from Norwin
High School, competed in 52 con-

tests and started in all but one‘3‘f
those games.

He currently has three career
goals —— one game-winning —— and
six points.

Boehm, a midﬁelder from
South Park, competed in 44 career
games, 35 of which he started.

Boehm scored three career
goals —— one was a game—winner -
added two assists and accumulated
eight points in his career.

Last year, head coach Joe Lu};-
bacher’s team ﬁnished with a dig-
appointing record of 2-13-2 (1—9-1
in Big East play).

The team’s only victories were
over Seton Hall, Robert Morris and
California University (Pa.).

Yet the seniors seem conﬁdent
that things are sure to turn around
this season.

Pirates’ young talent brings
hope to franchise

MCT Campus

I Center ﬁelder Andrew McCutchen slides to make a catch. He is among‘ the

Pirates’ revamped young core that hopes to end the 'team’s futility.

Torie Wytiaz I Staff Writer

For more than a decade, the public rela-
tions department of the Pittsburgh Pirates
has attempted to generate fan support for
a woeful baseball team bycreating inspi-
rational slogans that show a dedication
to winning. A

But Pirates fans have witnessed 17 con-

secutive losing seasons, and an 18th seems A

likely. A telltale sign of the growing frustra-
tion regarding management and on-ﬁeld
play appears in the Facebook group “Pitts.-
burgh Pirates: Rebuilding Since 1993,”
which has more than 2,000 members.

It certainly seems that 17 years should
be enough time to acquire and develop

' a baseball team worthy of professional '

competition, and although 2010 might
fortify the Pirates’ record for the most con-
secutive losing seasons in North American
professional sports history, the team made
strides to invest in the future.

Beginning in May with the recall of Neil

Walker, the Pirates went on a ciuest to re-
turn some youth to the suffering lineup.
Walker, along withjose Tabata, Brad Lin-

coln and Pedro Alvarez found consistent '

playing time in recent months and give a
glimmer of future hope to the dwindling
Pirates faithful fans. '

Neil Walker

‘Walker, drafted by the Pirates in the
first round of the 2004 draft, ‘knows all

_ too well of the losing that plagues the Pitts-

burgh club."A Pittsburgh native, Walker
attended the local Pine-Richland High
School and entered the Pirates system
upon graduation. _ r V

Walker saw limited action in 2009,
serving as a pinch hitter in several games’.

Dixon not worried about conference rumors

ﬂu Livingston I For The Pitt News 

If MGM were to commission a T

remake of the legendary 1986
basketball movie “Hoosiers,” few
would be better suited for the role
ﬁNorman Dale than Pitt basket-
ball head coach Jamie Dixon.

Just as Dale demonstrates by
having his players measure the
height of the baskets at Con-
seco Fieldhouse, Dixon will be
the first to say basketball is the
same wherever it is played. The
44-year-old is especially well
traveled for his age, having made
stops at seven schools in his four
years of playing and 21 years of
coaching college basketball.
“79Though the height of the buck-
ets has unsurprisingly been the
same at each of these seven des-
tinations, the teams shooting on
them have ﬂuctuated constantly.
Dixon has played and coached in
the Southwest Conference, the
Big West Conference, the Western
Athletic Conference and the Big
East Conference.

frialny

  

During Dixon’s time in those
conferences, many schools
joined and left due to conference
realignment, but the potential
shifts could be bigger than any
Dixon has yet faced.

The most prominent confer-
ences in the NCAA have begun
to pursue new members aggres-
sively, and college athletics are
feeling the shockwaves of these
searches.

This summer, the Pac-10 an-
nounced it would add two big
programs: Utah from the Moun-
tain West Conference in 2011
and Colorado from the Big 12 in
2012. The Big Ten grabbed a Big
12 school as well when they an-
nounced that Nebraska would be
joining their ranks in 2011.

J Even though this summer’s
conference realignments didn’t
affect the Big East, its future
remains unclear. After all, few
things are certain now that the
Big Ten will have 12 teams, where-

as the Big 12 is slated to end up
with 10. ‘

Despite these unprecedented
changes, Dixon is anything but
worried. He has been conditioned
to stay calm when his surround-
ings change. '

|“Everywhere I’ve
been, there’s been

realignment. Whatever
happens, schools survive
and schools do well.”

—- Jamie Dixon I

“Everywhere I’ve been, there’s
been realignment,” Dixon said
after an open practice in July.
“Whatever happens, schools sur-
vive and schools do well. It usu-
ally turns out to be not as drastic
of a change as everyone thinks it’s

going to be.” .
Dixon’s time coaching in the
Big East might have played an in-
tegral role in the formation of this
nonchalance. During the past de-
cade, the conference looked like

it could be in trouble when Bos-_ ,

ton College, Miami and Virginia
Tech left for the ACC in 2005.
But the departures of those

' schools actually strengthened

Big East men’s basketball because

of the subsequent additions of A

Cincinnati, Louisville, Marquette
and South Florida. ‘

V “It was the end of the world
four years ago, when there were
the changes with going to 16, and
look what’s happened,” Dixon
said. “Nobody_predicted it would

‘ get better, and it’s gotten better,

and that’s- what we have to rec-
ognize.” '
Dixon also said even though
the Big East is just a few years
removed from losing teams to
the ACC, the instability hasn’t

translated into ups and downs
on the court.

“I think what’s really happened
over the years is that we’ve really
clearly established ourselves as
the best conference — the most
consistent, the deepest confer-
ence — and then I think that
every other one has kind of had
their ups and downs and fallen
into that second spot, whether
it be the ACC, Big Ten, Pac 10 or
the SEC specifically and the Big
12, as well.”

Like teams in the Big East, nu-
merous colleagues and players
have come and gone for Dixon
during his time at Pitt. Brandin
Knight graduated during Dixon?s
ﬁnal year as assistant coach, but
returned to his side in 2008 as
an assistant. g

Knight said he views the ri-
valries in the Big East as multi-
faceted, developing because of
factors beyond proximity and
history.

. ning to replace the Backyard Brawl as the
Panthers’ biggest hardwood battle.
“In-conference, I think everyone thinks
' West Virginia is our only rivalry. UConn,
Syracuse,'Notre Dame —— those rivalries
have developed into pretty signiﬁcant
games every single time,” Knight said.
“West Virginia is the one they keep alive,

‘ _so no matter what, we continue to play

West Virginia. That’s the big ‘rivalry game,’
whereas Villanova has become our in-state

. rivalry.-”

Knight said he knew the potential ben-
1- eﬁts that could result from a move outside
I the Big East than Dixon, but he said what-
ever happens, the coaching staff’s goals
will remain the same. A

and continue to make progress. As far as
just winning games, recruiting good kids,

satisfying to myself and Coach Dixon,” he

said. “The longer these kids improve on
the basketball court, improve as people, as
students, that’s all we can ask for.”

Dixon, on the other hand, maintains a
loftier set of goals.

He said he views the program as more
than just a way to help players improve
on and off the court. To him, success in
basketball goes hand in hand with insti-
tutional advancement.

“What I want it to be is a program that
represents the University to the highest
level, striving to reach the same standards
that our University is,” he said. “We’re try-
ing to be a top program in the country in
basketball, as well as what we’re trying to
do academically with our medical school,
our law school, our business school -
whatever it may be — and trying to be one
of the best public research institutions in
the country. That’s how I look at it — prob-
ably not a common answer from a coach,
but that’s what we want to be.” I

like, it really helps you when
it’s your turn, because you got a
chance to sit back and analyze it
see how it’s done, rather than
being forced into a situation and
not knowing what it looks like,”
Cignetti said. _
Last season, Sunseri got the
chance to observe an offense full
of high—powered weapons, such

as Heisman hopeful Dion Lewis-

and All-American candidate Jon
Baldwin. Sunseri said it’s com-
forting to know those players,
among others, return to the ﬁeld
this season.

.$3;‘We understand the weap-
ons that we have,” Sunseri said.
“There are athletes all across the
board, and I just have to be able
to give them the ball and be able
to move and score points.”

Baldwin said he’s conﬁdent
in Sunseri’s ability to do exactly
that.

“I can tell from the spring,

’ Tino’s done a great job getting

the huddle orchestrated, pick-

   
  
   
 
 
 
 
 

';..n.

ing guys up, telling guys when
they made a mistake and getting
on guys if they make a mistake,”
Baldwin said.

He added that it’s important
to have a strong leader at quar-
terback.

“You always want to have
somebody if you mess up to get on
you, not if you mess up just, ‘It’s
OK.”’ Baldwin said. “Most guys
like a tougher guy at quarterback.
Bill [Stull] was a tough guy and
Tino’s a tough guy as well.”

Cignetti said that two of
Sunseri’s greatest strengths as
a player are his capability as a
leader and his competitiveness,
so he’s not concerned about Sun-
seri’s ability to perform in'cru-
cial situations. In fact, he said
the new quarterback will thrive
under pressure. ‘

“You’d always like your quar-
terback to be a leader,” Cignetti
said. “Fortunately, our quarter-

back is a leader. Competitors and.

leaders like Tino, they thrive on

adversity. They can’t wait to be
put in_that position and be suc-
cessful.”

Sunseri agreed, saying he feels
ready to lead the team on crucial
scoring drives, like Stull did last
season when the Panthers scored
the ﬁnal 18 points of the game af-
ter trailing Connecticut 21-6 with
less than four minutes remaining
in the third quarter.

l"‘I’m ready to take that
role where, if it’s a

pressure situation .and
We need to score points,

I that I can do that.”

-- Tino_Sunseri I

' “Everyone keeps saying that
I’m going to be a manager,” he
said. “I don’t think I’m going to
be a manager. I think I’m ready

to take that role where, if it’s a
pressure situation and we need
to score points, that I can do
that.”

Despite the faith in Sunseri
headed into the season, coach
Dave Wannstedt said that Sun-
seri still needs some time to build
up his conﬁdence as the starting
quarterback.

He said that although Sunseri
hasthe belief of the team and
the coaches, real conﬁdence in
himself comes only with game
experience and playing time in

, training cafnp. - _
Most of the talk heading into

training camp centers around
Sunseri’s strong arm, but Wannst-
edt and Cignetti said that’s not
the only ability Sunseri brings to
the quarterback position.

“He understands play design,”
Cignetti said. “He understands
exactly what’s expected of him
when he gets that play call. He’s
a‘ good athlete, he can play within
the pocket, he can play outside

the pocket. He is tough. It’s going
to be exciting to watch him grow
and develop.” ’ 
Wannstedt echoed Cignetti?s7
statements, saying that at this
time a year ago, Sunseri was split-jg
ting ﬁrst team reps with Stull. 
added that Sunseri not only 
the arm to ‘make all the throws,’i:ff
but he’s intelligent and athletic.
During the off-season, Sunseri ,

said he mostly concentrated on 7 '

making sure he knew the pla 
book, so that he could answer 
questions posed in the huddleiii
He also worked on footwork-a_n_d—'
fundamentals, because he said it’s
important‘ not to get away from
those skills. 
As the team enters trainingig
camp, Sunseri said he’ll use those];
skills to focus on the ﬁrst oppo-7'
nent he’ll face: the Pitt Panthers
defense. a
“We just have to get ready for;
those guys, -and then we have to?”
get ready for Utah. We just have to
take it one game at a time.” I

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Pitt hopesto rebound

from dismal season

  

 

 

 

- ?.

Diana Connor I For The Pitt News

‘l  Redshirt senior J ania Sims drives to the hoop against Connecticut last year.

 

1, She hopes to lead the Panthers back to the NCAA Tournament.

;‘Torie Wytiaz I Staff Writer

There’s still hope for the women’s basket-
ball team. l
Despite the transfer of three Panther
players, including one starter, the Panthers
will look to returning players for leadership
v and new recruits for fresh talent.
Kate Popovec, Sarah Ogoke and starting

center Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson all left-the

team last year.

Wilson, who played at Pitt for two years,
will transfer to Miami to join the Hurri-
canes, although she will sit out for one year
because of NCAA regulations.

g Wilson said that she “loved the Pitt team
and coaches dearly” but was ready for a
change, and the disappointments of the
season — which saw the Panthers win only

—J

ﬁve Big East games —' had nothing to do '

with her decision. , V

The Pitt women’s basketball program
has been on the rise for the past ﬁve years,
earning its ﬁrst NCAA Tournament berth in
2007, and followed that with two consecu-
tive Sweet 16 appearances.

Yet the Panthers failed to make the dance
this past season and lost in the ﬁrst round
of the NIT tournament.

Part of the reason for this slight lapse V

might have been the lack of senior presence
on and off the court. ‘Head coach Agnus Be-
renato, who came to Pitt in 2003, noted the
value of veteran leadership for a successful
basketball team. -

“In previous years, we have had seniors

High expectations for
Pirates’ Alvarez

< Pirates 122_ <

Walker in the inﬁeld proved to be a saving
grace, as he was able to replace Akinori
Iwamura at second base.

Walker has also made his presence
known at the plate, consistently batting
third in the Pirates’ lineup. He recently
became the first Pirates rookie to record
five hits in one game since 1991 whenjohn
Wehner, who is now a Pirates commenta-
tor, did it. ..

Walker’s success proves it’s possible for
the Pirates organization to take a draft pick
and eventually mold that player into a ma-
jor league-caliber performer. Perhaps the
only question that remains among fans is
why_such a development took six years.

Jose Tabata

On June 9, after dropping four of its
last five games, the Pirates decided to give
Jose Tabata a chance to add spark to the
sluggish offense.

Tabata’s 2 for 4 debut performance in-
cluded a steal, a walk and a run scored. He

didn’t»earr‘i a winvthat night, but heear'n_ed.

a’starting position. ‘I

. ~ With Tabata in’the outﬁeld alongside
Andrew Mccutchen, the Pirates gain an
incredible amount of speed. McCutchen
and Tabata lead the team in stolen bases
with 21 and 10 successful attempts, re—
spectively. Acquired by the Yankees as a
17 year old in 2005, Tabata was traded to
the Pirates in 2008 and began his play in
the Triple-A system.

One major concern might be Tabata’s
tendency to attract negative media, some-
thing the Pirates could do without. Tabata’s
wife entered the news during spring train-
ingwhen she reportedly feigned pregnancy
and abducted an infant. Claims have also
been made concerning the accuracy of
Tabata’s age. But Tabata seems tohave.
handled such attention well without allow-
ing it to impact his progress as a baseball
player. ’

Brad Lincoln

The Pirates’ starting pitching rotation
struggled to find one or -two aces in the
past, let alone ﬁve solid pitchers. The Pi-
rates chose Lincoln, the fourth overallpick
in the 2006 draft, with the hopes that his
right arm would serve in the rotation for
future years. 0

But intypical Pirates’ pitcher fashion,
Lincoln faced injury early in his career
andunderwent Tommy John surgery in
2007, missing the entire season. The Pi-
rates organization firmly believed in its

 PNC Parkwatched while the most promis-5‘

and grounded into a double play in his'firsVt_»__

choice, though, and kept Lincoln until he ’
made his major league debut with Tabata
onjune 9. _  by
Lincoln earned his ﬁrst victory onjune 
30 with a shutout performance, but follow-jglij
ing ajuly 25 loss, Lincoln found himsel
demoted to the Triple-A club in Indianapo-57’
lis. According to the Pirates management, L
Lincoln was sent for more work on pitch- ’
ing mechanics and increasing his pitch‘;
speed. ‘ j V p I
Judging from the moments of domi-g
nance displayed by Lincoln in his win, he
has the raw talent necessary for a starting
pitcher. Perhaps Lincoln was brought up to

   

the big leagues prematurely, but in a situ-;;.= .

ation as dire as the Pirates’, such chances”
must be taken. ’

    
 
  
 



Pedro Alvarez

Four times people in the crowd ros
to their feet and four times they sat bac
down, disappointed in Pedro Alvarez’s firs
major league start onjune 16. The fans a

ing Pirates prospect struck out three times
four appearances at bat. V, .'_ .

Just more than a month later, Alvarez’s
home run tally is beginning to climb. Even
in Alvarez’s early struggles and strikeouts,
it was evident that he had one of the purest
swings in baseball.

The process of signing Alvarez was
not an easy one for the Pirates, and ne-
gotiations made on the subject frequented

. Pittsburgh ‘news outlets as fans hoped for

Alvarez to commit to the localclub. Upon
contract ﬁnalization, Alvarez became one
of the most valued young players in the
Pirates’ history, and his potential success
in the major leagues was highly antici-A‘
pated. , ]

Alvarez, a Dominican Republic na-
tive nicknamed “El Toro” —— The Bull
— will continue to develop and harness
his strength as a power hitter andmake
a lasting impact on the Pirates’ offensive
lineup.

After the midseason all-star game,
crowds at PNC Park traditionally seem less
enthusiastic about the players on the field
than they did in spring months. Bobble-
head dolls and postgame concerts bring-
fans to the seats. But the closing games
of the 2010 season might bring more ex-
citement than a ﬁreworks show, as the
young Pirates team exhibits an exuber-
ant style of play that will hopefully lead

‘a failing organization into improvement
- and winning. H

Dixon works out
with NBA teams

iLuc Felak | Senior Staff Photographer

l Former Panther Jermaine Dixon wasn’t selected in the draft, but he still

hopes to make an‘NBA roster.

)

Lauren Kirschman I Senior Staff Writer

r*‘<S~»¢‘«.'a3-')s'«\-1  ‘ 

Last season,Jermaine Dixon was known as
Pitt’s top defensive guard and was counted
on to shut down the opposing team’s best
perimeter player.

This year, as the Pitt men’s basketball»

team travels to Ireland to adjust to playing
without the graduated shooting guard,
Dixon is spending his summer preparing
to advance his basketball career.

“I’ve been training and getting ready
for the professional level,” Dixon said. “I
worked out with a few NBA teams, like the
Nets and the Bucks.”

' Working out with those teams gave Dix-
on theopportunity to see where he stands

with ‘some of the upper-level prospects. _

“The process is good,’’, he said. “It’s
deﬁnitely alearning experience. I had the

V.

_.l

players in the country, and it was fun. It
was an experience.” , ' '
With the Nets, he saw familiar Big East
face Luke Harangody from Notre Dame,
and in his workout with the Bucks, he

worked out with former St. John’s player _

Anthony Mason Jr. 9 V
. “I think I did well against_the top guys,”

Dixon said. “The teams that I worked out

chance to work out with some of thetopg A

for liked me. I feel like I played well.”
Currently, Dixon is preparingyfor the

prospect of going overseas to play profes-

sional basketball, something other Pitt
players have done in the past, including
Levance Fields who played in Russia and
Tyrell Biggs who played in Greece. I
Dixon said he doesn’t have a prefer-
ence for the country where he ends up,

The problem with his absence lies in the
fact that the Steelers" offensive line was hor-
rendous last season and they currently have
very little depth. First round draft choice

' Maurkice Pouncey willalmost certainly be

thrust into a starting position as a rookie, a
situation the team has tried to avoid in'the
past._AObviously, some rookies thrust into
starting roles have done well in the past ——
see a certain SuperBowl—winning quarterback
everyone is trying to run out of town —— but it
is never an ideal situation. With Colon gone,
however, the line must be shuffled because of

. the lack of depth and the inevitable question

is posed: Who plays where‘? . A‘

There are several scenariosthat have to a
‘ ‘be considered. Right tackle is obviously the

biggest one, with no less than four or ﬁve

. players in the running to start there. The

Steelers could move solid starting left tackle
Max Starks over to right tackle, where he has
played previously, but that leaves the left
tackle as the weak spot — a huge football
no—no. , i . ,

If Starks does indeed switch, then Trai
Essex, who has experience at left tackle but
played less than stellar last year at right
guard, might take over there. Pouncey would
then move into the right guard position, with
veteran Justin Hartwig likely to retain his
center position. Confused yet?

The team had other off-the—ﬁeld issues
with former receiver Santonio Holmes. Hol-
mes, who was facing a four—game suspension
for violating the 1eague’ssubstance abuse
policy and facing legal accusations that he
threw a drink in a woman’s face in an Orlando
bar, was traded to the New York Jets for a
ﬁfth round pick. ‘

Some were angry about this trade, think-

ing the Steelers got remarkably little in return . ~ .

for a former Super Bowl MVP. But once it_,is
examined closer, the Steelers traded him at
his lowest possible value. There were rumors
about him being released, he had a history
of off—the-ﬁeld problems dating back before
he entered the league, andhe was facing a

' suspension. Combine all that and it was a

pretty easy call. ,
Now I know that some people were mad

that Holmes got traded instead of Roeth-

lisberger, but to me it’s a pretty easy call. A

I want to see Pitt in the Final

matters worse, West Virginia made it last
year before falling to Duke. So I would love
nothing more than to see Pitt ﬁnally make
a Final Four before I graduate.

I want to see DionfLewis

to winning the Heisman is

_ having hype, and there’s a i

reason the trophy usually goes to the best
player from USC, Florida, Ohio State or
Oklahoma — those schools have a lot of

- hype and get a lot of exposure in the be.-

ginning of the year. The first week ofthe
season is crucial in the Heisman race.
Lewis is one of the best running backs
in the country, and he could be the best K
this year. Luckily,.Pi_tt will receive a lot of
exposure the first week by playing Utah
—— and having the game broadcast on Ver-

Though it’s clearly an NHL arena, all

of the new amenities caught the attention

of the NCAA.

Pitt will be hosting the SEC/Big East
Invitational when it plays Tennessee there
in December, and McMillan said they are
planning to host the City Game between
Pitt and Duquesne there every year.

“Hopefully this will allow Pitt to have
some bigger events here,” he said. “Maybe
a team like Kentucky won’t want to come
play at the smaller Petersen Events Center,
but they may want to play here.”

According to McMillan, the new arena

but co—owners Mario Lemieux and Ron
Burkle wanted it to be a home for Pitts-
burgh’s other sports teams as well. Thanks
to them, Pitt fans might be able to watch
Duke in Pittsburgh soon, rather than trav-

;;m_ove involves the commitment of Yasmin
TFuller,a combo guard from Seattle.

;_ Fuller was a McDonald’s A1l—American

Enominee in her senior year of high school

and was ranked as the 141st overall pros-

‘pect by the All—Star Girls Report.

u’ In addition to possessing athletic skill

has a basketball player, Fuller also considers

R herself a good ﬁt in the Pitt program.

August 25, 2010 I The Pitt News l WWW.pittnews.com

“lg love this team,” Fuller said after a
visit to the Pitt facilities in the spring. “The
coaching staff felt like moms to me, and all
the players were great.”

Berenato echoed those sentiments of her
new freshman and went on to anticipate
Fuller’s potential impact on the 2010-11
team. .

“She had great chemistry with our team

and staff, and I look forward to coaching
her on and off the court,” Bjerenato said.
“Yasmin is a great 3-point shooter andis
not afraid to establish herself as an off-
guard rebounder. She will give us depth
and diversity at our guard position on a
daily basis.”

Fuller will be joined by earlier recruits
Kyra Dunn, Marquel Davis and Asia Logan

erenato looks to recover from several departures

in a freshman class that looks to comple-
ment the experienced play of the returning
seniors. '

“I am really excited about the freshman;
class and what they will bring to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh,” Berenato said. ‘‘All
four of these women have tremendous work
ethics and know how to elevate their team
to a higher level.” I

FOOTBALL

Tonyjovenitti I Assistant Sports Editor

Football games can be an expensive outing.
Nevermind ticket prices, food and parking
alone could run you close to $40.

*5’ But students can get both of those for free
at Pitt games.

In addition to the reasonably priced season
tickets, students can get free parking and free
tailgate packs before every home game.

The Great Lawn Tailgate is an option for
students without cars. Groups of students re-
ceive a grill and a tailgate pack, complete with
hot dogs, chips, and condiments.

The tailgate starts three hours before the
game and, if students leave campus early

.. er.1.9,ugh,_1:he buseswill d1topJhe.m.9iItigl1E at ,

...the Great Lawn, which is located next tojerome
ettis’ Grille 36 along the Ohio River. But, start-
ing one hour prior to games, the buseswill drop
students of at Point State Park and students
will have to walk across the Fort Duquesne
Bridge to Heinz Field.

“There will be a DJ [at the tailgate] and
some sort of live entertainment,” Jonathan
Malek, associate director of marketing for
Pitt Athletics, said. “We are looking into get-
ting bands.”

But perhaps one of Pitt’s best kept secrets
is the free parking for students. Most parking

spots on the North Shore cost $20 or more on
game days, but starting Wednesday before
the games — and Monday before a Thurs-
day game — students can go to the William
Pitt Union ticket office and ﬁll out a form to
receive a pass. '

The passes are limited and are distributed
on a ﬁrst—come, ﬁrst—serve basis. Students need
their,Pitt ID, license plate number and the make '
and model of the vehicle that will be taken to
the North Shore.

But the student parking lots are on the far 7
side of PNC Park along Lacock Street under-
neath the Interstate 279 overpass, which is the

__f:ar_I:_l1_e_s_t_l_ot»from Heinz Field.

One prominent issuelwith student  I W '

ing, though, is underage-drinking. Malek said
that the University itselfdoesn’t monitor alco-
hol at Heinz Field. It is the police’s responsibil-
ity. He said that there aren’t any extra penalties
for students caught drinking underage at Heinz
Field parking lots. ' ,

“Students are subject to all of the penalties
of normal underage drinking, so I don’t think
there is too much tied in with the actual event,”
Malek said.

Malek added that they wouldn’t lose their ‘

parking privileges or their season tickets. I

< Dixon 131 < I

basketball at the professional level. He
said his agent is talking to teams in Israel,
Italy and Turkey, and Dixon is waiting on
word from them.

“I’m ready to go wherever it takes me,”
he said. “I really don’t have a preference. I
hear Israel is a nice country, so I wouldn’t
mind going there. I hear good things about
it from people that played there.”

He said his greatest strengths that
he’ll bring to a team are his defense and
his ability to get the basket, adding that
he’s able to defend a lot of different guys,
something that Panther fans know well
from watching him in a Pitt uniform for
two years. ‘

He’s working on his jump shot and
ball—handling skills, because he’s trying
to make the transition to point guard.

Through itall, he’s keeping in shape.
He said he works out every day by lifting,
getting up and down the court and running
on the track while he waits to hear where
his basketball career will take him.

Dixon worked out 

Bucks

During his ﬁnal season at Pitt, Dixon
was fourth on the team in scoring, with
10.6 points per game, while also grab-
bing four rebounds per game. In his junior
year, he put up 8.4 points and averaged
2.6 rebounds. 4 .

He transferred to Pitt for his junior
season after spending two years at Tal-
lahassee Junior College. Dixon emerged
as a leader during his s_enior season, even
after sitting out the first part of the year
with a foot injury. 

This year’s Panthers know what they’ll
be missing without Dixon on the court.
Before the team left for Ireland, senior Gil-
bert Brown said one of the positives of the
trip was giving the team an opportunity to
adjust to playing without Dixon. 

“[It gives us a chance] just to get a.littlj_e
bit of a feeling of how we’re going to play
withoutjermaine Dixon, to see how we’re
going to orchestrate the offense and also
on the defensive end, because he was our
defensive player,” Brown said. I '
