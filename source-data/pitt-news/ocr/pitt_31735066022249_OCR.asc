UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Donahue offers social analysis

By David Ballarotto
Staff Writer

Phil Donahue, popular televi-
sion talk-show host, spoke Friday
at the Carnegie Music Hall about
the problems facing American so-
ciety today.

The return of old man winter
did not discourage audience turn-
out for the lecture sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council. Au-
dience members had Donahue
answering their questions for
over two and a half. hours.

In his lecture, Donahue said
the culture in which he grew up
prepared his generation for a
world that did not exist.

”What we realized after leav-
ing the University of Notre
Dame,” Donahue said, ”was that

we'd been prepared for a world

that never materialized."

Donahue said the world of the
1950s and 1960s prepared its
youth for a world in which wom-
en were secondary to men.

”I never trusted [women] from
the neck up  These curvaceous
women were bad thoughts,”

"Donahue said. ”At confession

we'd say ‘My Father, I confess _I
had 38 bad thoughts.’ ”

The culture of the 19505 and
1960s, Donahue said, never pre-
pared its youth for divorce. It was
not until the mid-'70s when his
first marriage dissolved, giving
him custody of his four children,
that Donahue came to realize the
problems women were facing.

’’[I saw] things I never noticed
before. My kids’ socks  looked
like they'd been through combat
 If you invited me to your house
now, I’d notice your floors,’’
Donahue said. ‘

Another problem facing this
country, Donahue said, is the
quality of education.

”We have people out there
who don't know what eight times
seven is,” said Donahue. ”These
are the ‘Boys of Summer’ that you
probably see here at Three
Rivers’ Stadium — shirtless males
with beer cans who speak a
differentlanguage: ’I want to talk
about_sex.’ ”

Donahue said these people are
in need of education and respon-
sibility. He said statistics show
that 60 percent of all men be-
tween 18 and 24 years of age did
not vote in the last election.

According to Donahue, this
lack of responsibility, along with

the ill—prepared adolescence and
the infatuation America has with
itself, is hurting its credibility. He
said he learned this when six
weeks ago he did a series of
Donahue programs in the Soviet
Union. .

Donahue said, ’’I asked au-
dience members, ’Where would
you like to go if you visited the
United States?’ Some said ‘Ox-
ford, Miss., home of your great
author William Faulkner.’ And I
wondered how many Americans
knew that.”

Donahue continued to say that
Soviet citizens read American
literature more than Americans.
”There is a fascination with
American classics that I'm not

sure exists in our culture — cer- '

tainly not with the Boys of Sum-
mer,” Donahue said.

Donahue said Americans are
too dependent upon others in our
society. He said we expect other
people to know what's best for
us.

”We still have to deal with
people who think they know
what's best for us,” Donahue told
his audience. ”Not unlike men in

AIDS publicity overshadows

danger of other forms of VD

By Robert Byrd

Associated Press Writer

ATLANTA — AIDS is dominat- 1
ing the headlines, but other sex-

ually transmitted diseases still
affect millions, including another
virus believed to cause cancer
that is ”spreading in epidemic

’ proportions,” researchers say.

Sexual contact has become the
chief form of transmission of one
form of hepatitis, a liver disease.
Chances of getting such diseases
as herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea
and syphilis are vastly higher than
the odds of getting AIDS.

”Because of the consequences
of AIDS, it's very easy to say these
other sexually transmitted dis-
eases are just nuisances.

”You don't die, generally, from I

gonorrhea or syphilis and certain-
ly not from chlamydia,” said Dr.
Jonathan Zenilman of the Divi-
sion of Sexually Transmitted Dis-
eases at the Atlanta-based
national Center for Disease
Control. '

“But there's a danger of them
getting lost in the shuffle. They
are still very much important
health problems,-" he said.

AIDS has struck more than

33,000 people in the United
States, so farkilling more than
19,000. In 1986 alone, 12,049
cases of AIDS were diagnosed in
the United States, the CDC
reports.

But there were more than 13
million cases of other sexually
transmitted diseases in that same
year, according to CDC es-
timates.

Last year's total "included
896,383 reported cases of gonor-
rhea, up from 883,826 ayear
earlier but down from 1,042,900
in 1980. Researchers say report-
ed cases are the tip of the iceberg;
the true incidence of gonorrhea
is estimated at two million to
three million cases in 1986.

Other estimates include four

million to five million cases of‘

chlamydia, one million cases of
genital warts from human papil-
loma virus, 500,000 new herpes
cases and 90,000 cases of syphi-
Iis, Zenilman said.

Human papilloma virus of
HPV, a cause of venereal warts,
was thought to be just a nuisance,
but new research is strongly
pointing to the virus as a cause of
cervical cancer, he said.

The virus also can cause anal

cancer, most often in homosexu-
al men, and squamous cell
cancers in the mouth, he said.
”I think HPV is probably going
to be the disease of the '80s and

’90s,”_ said Dr. Alan Lawhead, as-A

sistant professor of gynecology
and obstetrics at Atlanta's Emory
University and a specialist in
HPV research. ‘
Researchers believe HPV can
spread even when warts are not
obvious, he noted. As many as 10
percent of women who show no
symptoms of HPV-related disease
may be infected. “
Although hepatitis B, a type of
contagious liver disease, is not
commonly considered a ”sexual-
ly transmitted» disease,” sexual
contact has become the chief

mode of transmission, Zenilman-

said.

Scientists estimate that 200,000
cases occurred in the United
States last year, 10 percent of

those patients becoming chronic

carriers of the disease.

a life-threatening condition, but it
certainly causes substantial emo-
tional trauma to anybody and

DeSiIIers’ condition

By Tara Bradley-Steck

Associated Press Writer

Doctors gave 7-year-old Ron-
nie DeSiI|ers blood transfusions
andihis mother played tapes of in-
spirational readings and lullabies
as the Miami boy struggled to live
with a second new liver.

”I’m working on his subcons-

cious, telling him how God was

recreating every cell in his body,”
Maria DeSillers said Saturday. ”I
felt that if he [believed]  that this
was just a step to a better life and
better health, that he could pull
through it."

Doctors at Children's Hospital
of Pittsburgh had told DeSi|lers'a
second operation would be ”a
very close call” because of a viral
infection that had damaged Ron-

nie’s first transplanted liver and _

spread to his lungs.

But she said she told Ronnie to
concentrate only on positive
thoughts and not to despair.

’_’He’s a fighter, and I've always
been that way,” DeSillers said.
”I’ve tried to teach him that some

' of the best things in life he can get

by putting up a fight. When
everything seems to be against
you, put blinders on and concen-
trate on where-you're going to
be.” 2

Ronnie received his second

-donor liver in a 14-hour opera-

tion_that ended early Saturday,
according to Children's spokes-
woman Lynn McMahon. He was
in critical condition in the inten-
sive care unit early Sunday, con-
sidered normal following a
transplant operation.

State-awarded contract undergoes investigation

WASHINGTON — The state
department awarded a non-
competitive contract in 1985 to
a firm involved in the |ran—Contra

' affair, although an official of the

awarding office was the brother
of a key company employee.

A congressman and a federal
ethics official are questioning the
propriety of the contract, which
was awarded after the depart-
ment official’s sister made the
major sales pitch on the compa-
ny's behalf.

The brother, however, said his

actions were approved by state‘

department legal officers. The
state department legal office
would not comment on the con-
tract, which is under investigation
by the department's inspector
general.

His visit to Chile was finally
free from the violent anti-

his arrival Wednesday.

John Paul spoke from an open-

”You may think the pope is not

Political prisoners are

permitted to emigrate

WASHINGTON — Cuba has
allowed 20 former long-term po-
litical prisoners to emigrate to the
United States in the past 10
weeks, sending them at the rate
of two a week in an apparent at-
tempt to avoid publicity, accord-
ing to U.S. officials.

The officials said the piecemeal
approach appeared aimed at
eliminating the tumultuous
receptions that have accompa-
nied large-scale prisoner releases
in the past and have received ex-
tensive media attention.

All 20 Cubans were released
from prison last May following a
personal appeal to President Fidel
Castro by French undersea ex-
plorer Jacques Cousteau, who
visited Cuba in la-te 1985.

The last two of the 20 arrived
Wednesday aboard a weekly
charter flight that operates be-
tween Miami and Havana. The
other 18 had arrived on earlier
charter fli_ghts.

A restriction of funds has
caused the Student Government
Allocations Committee to deny,
revise or defer more than 44 per-
cent of all requests from student
organizations, as the allocations
process draws to a close this
week.

Ninety—two student organzia—
tions put forth $389,874 in budg-

et requests for the 1987-88 fiscal
year; only $217,547 was availa-
ble for allocations. The Alloca-
tions Committee recommended
approval of $155,617, or 71.5
percent of available funds, leav-
ing $61,930 for appeals. Organi-
zations have submitted $67,845
in appeals. The appeals hearings
will conclude on Thursday.
Nine organizations, classified
by student government as gover-
nance groups, represent 65 per-

Administration's
on the ball again

In the most recent Student Affairs Advisory Committee meet-
ing, university President Wesley Posvar mentioned that there

_ may be a need to create more after-hours study areas at the

university.

His statement came after several years of complaints to stu- ~

dent government representatives and through Pitt News editori-

als concerning the need for after-hours study areas.
What will be done, however, remains to be seen.
' While this interest in the good will of the students is appreciat-

so is the university.

’ ed, one must remember that talk is cheap — and, in this case,

”The problem is the expense of keeping the building open,”
said Conney Kimbo, vice president for Student Affairs.

At the SAAC meeting last Thursday, Posvar suggested that
an analysis be conducted concerning the availability and need
for an after-hours study area on campus.

There are a number of buildings which have excellent poten-
tial as sites for after hours study, including the Cathedral of
Learning, the William Pitt Union, Forbes Quadrangle, and, of

course, Hillman Library.

The primary difficulty would seem not to be keeping a build-
ing open so much as finding responsible individuals to police

the facility that is chosen.

The Student Activities Office would seem to be an excellent -

choice in this case as a problem solver. This office is specifi-
cally designated to provide services to students through stu-
dents. Using the work-study program to provide a staff of
persons responsible for the after-hours study area would be a

simple and cheap answer.

It took the administration five years to realize the need for
an after-hours study facility. Will it take them five more "to solve

the problem?
We hope not.

Black unity is ani

Through the Black Students Or-
ganization Coalition, I became
interested in the Black Action So-
ciety. The Black Student Organi-
zation Coalition is a gathering of
allied organizations spearheaded
by the Black Action Society. Each
representative was professional
and purposeful. Things were han-
dled in such a way as to ”get the
job done right.” They, also, al-
ways have a goal in mind,

progress for each organization
' and its constituency. No organi-
' zation showed itself more profes-
- sional and purposeful than the

mother organization, the Black
Action Society. I, like many

V others, was concerned with the

purpose —- black progression by
black unity. We got involved in
programming; the Net-
work/Journal, Political Action and
other Black Action Society com-

’ mittees. We did more than just sit

on our individual committees; we
helped one another's commit-
tees. Furthermore, we individual-
ly dealt with organizations
outside of the Black Action Soci-
ety -— for, example, the Student
Govenment Board, the Resident
Student Association and The Pitt
News. I thank our chairperson
and deputy chairperson for fulfill-
ing their greatest task, appointing
the right people for each job. So
many people were pulled into

There has been considerable

the Baby M. case. is surrogate
motherhood a morally justifiable
occupation, or is it further evi-
dence of a crumbling society?
Should we be willing to sit still
and watch as women rent their
wombs to anyone with $10,000?

You bet. ‘

People with nothingjbetter to .

out some cause to champion.
This time around, much to the
dismay of anyone interested in
personal freedom, that reaction-
ary sector of our society has chos-
en to come down on the evils of
surrogate motherhood.

I guess people who put them-
selves in the position of moral
judgment must think they have fi-

consideration and deep thought,
those people seem to have decid-

that, I'm still doing it. There are
times I think everyone should be-

have to realize, though, that I'm
no better than anyone else, and
I certainly don't have the monop-

even any idea what's right for
anyone but myself.

higher sanctity by allowing them-
selves to carry ababy they have
contracted to give up.

If there are people who find
this repulsive and amoral, fine.
They shouldn't get involved, the
problem will never involve them.

I'm not here to say that surroga-
cy is right, nor is it my place to
say that it is wrong. A decision so
personal as the one of contract-
ed motherhood should not be
legislated, nor should it be con-
demned by any government.

A woman should have the right
to do as she chooses so long as
she is not harming anyone.

It's time for the arrogant, mis-
guided individuals in our society
who think they have all the an-
swers to everyone’s problems
wrapped up in their narrow views
of the world to wake the hell up.

Ours-is, at least in our political
rhetoic, a society based on the
notion that the government
should interfere as little as possi-
ble in the lives of the citizens.
There is no need for intervention
in the morality of surrogate
motherhood.

If I believe it's wrong to drink,
or to dance or to have cosmetic

surgery, then it is my choice not

to engage in those activities.

Likewise, if a woman wishes to
have a child, and then give up
her rights to the child, it is not a

a thing to waste on a misguided
theocracy.

ers and followers, have made
such great happenings as Black-

We have done well but still
hold a goal in mind. This means
we have not yet become all that

The Black Action Society [is] like
anything that goes through its
stages filled with ups and downs.
The Black Action Society may
never reach its goal but, as long
as we do continue promoting our

reached our goal. We will make

stand together for a purpose. The
Black Action Society is evolving,
just as the earth and its inhabi-

The more we persist to expand

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 6, I987

It's raining, it's pouring. This
column stands a good chance of
being boring. But here we go
anyway.

0 The understatement of the
year: "I believe he was just over-
burdened with financial
problems,” Pat Robertson on
Oral Roberts. Funny, how their
last names are so similar.

. 0 And while we're on the sub-
ject of Robertson, isn't it distress-
ing to think that if he runs for
president, some people will actu-
ally vote for him?

0 Tell me if I'm wrong, but if
Janet Jackson isn't the most pack-
aged product on the market next
to diet Coke, her brother Michael
is. That's Mr. Jackson, if you're
nasty. ~

0 As you see printed on the op-
posite page, we received a letter
entitled "The True Black Action
Society.” What can we expect
next, The True Pitt Program
Council? The True French Club?
Will there be a mini—series to fol-
low? A book by Woodward and
Bernstein? "Stand with the BAS

- and survive.” But first, will the

real BAS please stand up?

0 A friend of mine from high
school called me Friday after-
noonand said there ‘was some-
thing wrong and asked me if I
would hurry up and meet her
somewhere. I rushed out the door
without a second thought. It's
good to know there are people
for whom I would still do
anything.

0 So far, the SGB has reported
that only 550 financial aid
response cards have. been
received. If you haven't filled one
out yet, you ought to.

Let's play

Did you ever wonder about the
people who write in the personal
ad sections of newspapers and
magazines? I just wish it was re-
quired that they submit pictures
to. go along with their write ups.

Then I wouldn't have to doubt
that all the ASSWFs are attractive,
slender, single, white females. Or
that all the GLSBMS are really
good-looking, single, black

' males. Who do these people

think they're kidding anyway?
They would have to feel like
"yeah, I'm a loser. I couldn't get
a date so I had to advertise.”

But these ''personal'' people
seem to have no scruples, much
less any qualms or embarass-
ment. They even have the audaci-
ty to specify the kind of people
they'd like to respond to their ad.

In Pittsburgh, a local
newspaper, is notorious for '
dedicating an entire page to per-
sonals. Her_e’s one from an SW
Renaissance Man: 32, 5'10", sleek,
150 Ibs., dark features, fairly attractive
(more so with clothes!).

Now, that's my kind of man.
He goes on to request an SWF:
21-29 with well toned body  Let's get
together for fun, relaxation, TLC and bat-

Nothing like being blunt. I have
to admit battery recharging is a
unique way to say sex.

"that lady" in last week's
column, but this woman just
won't go away. "There will be
war next year, repent!” she says,
or something like that. She came
up to me while I was having
lunch with one of my friends and
said that. I told her to leave me
alone, that I had been getting
high all morning, drinking all af-
ternoon and planned to steal lol-
lipops from small children later
that evening. Nonetheless, she
followed my friend and me and
everyone else on the second floor
of the restaurant and proceeded
to preach from table to table. As
she left, I said, quite loudly that
she should be locked up for life.
Everyone applauded.

who had a certain escort service
(perhaps it is still available) that

ice would ‘be needed more on a

that they shouldn't have even
offered the service at all — that,
at best, was a feeble attempt. Not

just that they should stick to what

Green grass
and High Times

I was browsing at a maga-
zine rack, and suddenly I
saw an issue of High Times.

I wasn't even aware that
High Times existed in
1987. High Times was very -
much a 1970's publication;
it was founded in 1974,
and its mission was to glori-
fy drug use. I remember its
centerfolds; instead of nude
women, High Times’ cen-
terfolds often featured huge
mounds of cocaine.

So there it was in front of

   

..

me on themagazine rack — — '

the latest issue of High Times. Just for curiosity’s sake, I picked
it up and took it to the cashier. As she rang up the sale, she
gave me a withering, contemptous look; in this age of "Just Say
No," purchasing a copy of High Times can be a potentially hu-
miliating experience. . ‘
When I got the magazine home, the first thing I noticed was
that it was virtually entirely devoted to marijuana. There were"

. no stories or pictures about harder drugs. That made me wonder.

about what had happened to the magazine's editorial direction.
I called High Times executive editor, John Howell.

"The reaction I most often get when I tell people what my
job is, is, 'High Times? You're still in business?’ " Howell said.

He said that the magazine's founder, Thomas Forcade (who
died in 1978), had wanted High, Times "to do for drugs what
Playboy did for sex, and what Rolling Stone did for music."
High Times’ circulation peaked at 500,000 monthly copies in
1978; currently, the circulation is around 250,000.

"|t’s definitely harder to publish a drug magazine _today,”
Howell said. "We find that most of our readers are 30 and older
or the younger generation under 22. Some of our biggest sub-
scribers are all the law enforcement agencies. They tell usoff
the record that they read our magazine to find out what the hell
is going on with drugs."

There was always a popular misconception about High Times, _
Howell said. "People thought that we advocated ingesting any-_A‘ ‘

thing you could get your hands on. But we always had a rigid
rule: no uplifting heroin stories."

Most other drugs, though, were fair game. "We wrote posi-
tively about recreational drug use," he said. "Part of our staff
wasn't comfortable promoting cocaine use, but others wanted
articles on the pleasures of freebasing. And there was a con-
tinuing interest in psychedelic mushrooms."

Howell is adamant that the magazine's main editorial.

philosophy hasn't changed. "We don't think drug use is wrong."
And he thinks that High Times readers enjoy a "vicarious ad-
venture" through the magazine. "Reading us creates a sense
of being outside the mainstream — slightly‘ outlaw."

Asked what he thought N-ancy Reagan's response would be
to an issue of High Times, Howell said, ”I.think it would be
hard to find a page in our magazine that wouldn't offend Mrs.
Reagan." And asked if he thought that most Americans would
consider the very existence of High Times to be immoral,
Howell said, "|mmoral? Some people tell me it should be ille-
gal. But I can't see our magazine disappearing unless‘ America
decides that the First Amendment means nothing."

Howell conceded that the nation's attitude toward drugs has
shifted dramatically since the end of the '70s, and he said tha

his magazine inevitably reflects that shift. I ‘

"You'll never see a cocaine centerfold in High Times again,"
he said. "You'll neverisee a major article praising cocaine.
Crack? I'.think crack is a dangerous substance. We will never
say that crack is good. - ,

"But studies have shown that there are 30 million people in

this country who regularly smoke marijuana. If I had to say what A‘

the future of High Times is going to be like, I would predict
that the magazine will be a rallying point for these people."

The cover price on High Times is $3.95, which is more ex- _ J 
pensive than most national magazines. The reason, Howell said_, _ A

is simple. '

”No mainstream national corporations want to advertise in '

our magazine. 50 we have to charge more to make up for the
advertising revenues we're not getting.”

But wouldn't this be a better country if no one used drugs? .

''I think alcohol is bad,” Howell said. "I think tobacco isbad.

Should we say that no one should have a drink? How far do  “

we want to extend it?"
And even though High Times’ circulation has plummeted,
Howell sees a bright spot. .

. "Since the government began its war on drugs last year, our I

circulation has crept back up a little bit,” he said. "We think
the government's attitude may actually be helping us in the long
run." '

Puerto Rican student interviews
for Chancellor's Scholarship

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

Sixteen—year—old Nayda Sus-
tache saw snow for the first time
in her life while visiting Pitts-
burgh as a special guest of the
university.

Sustache, from Caguas, Puerto
Rico, was able to visit Pittsburgh
through the generosity of Harry
Frost, Pitt alumnus and owner of
Regency Travel Agency. Several
weeks ago, Frost found out that
Pitt was interested in Sustache.

Frost made her trip possible by
sending her a round—trip ticket.
This ticket was the key for Sus-
tache’s interview for the Chancel-
lor's Scholarship, the most
prestigious scholarship a Pitt stu-
dent can_ be awarded.

Sustache, an active student at
Notre Dame High School, is a
member of the National Honor
Society, chemistry club, library
club and biology club. She also
participates in the tennis club and

road/track team.

She plans to be either a
mechanical or aerospace en-
gineer.

’’I had [begun] preparing for
this career early in high school
and spent my last three summers
taking advanced classes and spe-
cial programs in math and
science,” said Sustache.

Sustache added, ’’I decided to
study engineering because it is a
challenging career in which work
opportunities are endless.”

Sustache said that the process
of searching for universities in the
States has been a completely new
and enjoyable experience for her.

In late September, she visited
Purdue University as part of a
special engineering program for
minorities.

‘ When Sustache first arrived on
campus, she received quite a
shock. She said she didn't realize
where the campus began and
ended.

”Pitt’s environment provides
more opportunities than other

universities because it's not
rural,” said Sustache.

While observing Pitt, Sustache
said, ’’I didn't visualize Pitt to be
highly involved with engineering,
I thought more ofthe arts and
sciences. I noticed here that the
engineering department has good
facilities and faculty.”

If she decides to attend Pitt, she
will be thousands of miles away
from her family and friends. Sus-
tache said that while her parents
are sad, they are very understand-
ing about her studying abroad.

”l’m insecure to be competing
with American students. Ameri-
can students seem more ad-
vanced, and they have an edge,”
Sustache said.

’’In America, it is much more
liberal and freer than in Puerto
Rico. l’ll have to be responsible
and mature or I'll throw every-
thing away,” Sustache noted.

Since Sustache arrived at Pitt,
she has received a $2,000
provost scholarship and $4,000
in scholarships from the en-
gineering department.

She feels that although the col-
lege experience will be very ex-
citing for her, she will be very
serious about college and her
future.

Sustache stated, ’’I know that
this scholarship would enable me
to attend Pitt, as my financial
resources are limited. I view Pitt
as a college who cares about its
students and at the same time

, provides a quality education.”

will conduct a four—day seminar
in Starz|’s honor. The seminar
will feature the world’s foremost
leading experts in organ trans-
plantation.

”Invitations have gone out to
virtually all corners of the globe,”
said Greeno. ”We’re planning on
a fabulous collection of some of
the finest surgeons in the world.”
According to Presbyterian
University Hospital's media co-
ordinator, Chris Shier, the forum
might be attended by a number
of poltical dignitaries as well.
”Transplantation legislation has
been a hot political issue. The to-
rum should draw some political
attention,” Shier noted.
Participants in the forum will

Study says country

 music is a favorite A  

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -
Some people despise country
music and probably always
will, but the sound is ”univer-
sally popular,” a new study
shows.

The survey, by the Country
Music Association, said one
segment of society ”truly hates
country music.”

”They relate neither to the
culture of the music nor to the
sounds, performers or (radio)
stations,” the study says. These
people tend to be young ”and
as might be expected, heavily
oriented toward the sounds of
rock ’n’ roll and soft rock,” the

study says.
The study, done over one

month in 1986, polled 486
people aged 18 to 54 who had
bought a record for themselves
within the last three months.
People in 12 cities were sur-
veyed: Boston; Pittsburgh;
Memphis, Tenn., Birmingham,
Ala.,; Jacksonville, Fla.; St.
Louis; Chicago; Dallas;
Houston; Phoenix, Ariz.; San
Diego and Seattle. ’

The survey said 29 percent
of those polled were neutral
toward country music, 25 per-
cent were country music en-
thusiasts, 24 percent disliked
it, 18 percent were ”intrigued
outsiders” and the remaining
4 percent were ”drifters 3
raised on country music, but
moved away.”

Donahue said people in Ameri-
ca do not get upset about Penta-
gon spending; Americans see
themselves as living in a helpless
giant that was forced to attack
Tripoli at night without even
notifying Congress until after the
raid had begun.

”This is not the America I was
taught to be proud of,” said
Donahue. ”We’ve got to reassert
our democratic influence over
our government.”

Donahue said the United States
appears to be suffering from a
”collective inferiority complex.

”We’ve helped rebuild Europe
after the war; we helped Japan
become a major market. And
now nobody likes us,” Donahue
said.

Donahue concluded his lecture
by telling the audience that
Americans must learn to question
authority and to help end the

problems brought on by the Unit-
ed States’ lack of credibility, our
educational system’s faults and
the false world into which the na-
tion’s youth is brought.
Audience members were eager
to talk to Donahue, and the ques-
tion and answer session after the
lecture kept the audience inside
for more than 90 minutes.
Audience members were eager

-to discover what Donahue

thought of his new competitor,
Oprah Winfrey. Donahue said he
welcomed the competition,
which helped bring more au-
diences than ever before to day-

Listeners were also curious
whether Donahue would do a
week of programs in Pittsburgh.
He said his staff did a week of
Donahue programs in the 1970s

Sealed U. N. war-crime records spark controversy

UNITED NATIONS (AP) —
Two large safes in a building 16
blocks north of United Nations
headquarters hold 8,000 sealed
files containing a wealth of detail
on Nazi war criminals and their
crimes.

The 146 gray cardboard boxes
holding the files have become a
focus of controversy over
whether they should be opened

to Israel and to Holocaust
scholars.

The sealed U.N. War Crimes
Commission files had been all
but forgotten for 40 ‘years. They
list the names of 36,000 Nazi war
criminals, suspects and witness-
es and background on the work-
ings of the Nazi extermination
machinery used against the Jews
during World War II.

The Nazi war crimes list in the
files is closed. Access to the
secret files is permitted only to
U.N. member governments that
request the names of specific sus-
pects about whom they seek in-
formation.

Thenames listed make up a
veritable ”Who’s Who in Nazi
Germany,” including Nazi lead-
er Adolf Hitler, his henchmen
Heinrich Himmler and Adolf
Eichmann, who directed the
deportation of European Jews to
death camps and who was
hanged by Israel in 1962. Hitler
and Himmler committed suicide
in 1945.

The name that sparked the cur-
rent controversy was an obscure
ex—first lieutenant in Hitler's
Wehrmacht — Kurt Waldheim. In

~ post—war years, he rose to be-

come Austrian foreign minister,
U.N. secretary-general and, ulti-
mately, president of Austria. .
Waldheim’s name is the 724th
on the commission's 79th master
”List of War Criminals, Suspects
and Material Witnesses (Ger-

 MakeMon    

mans, Italians, -Bulgarians and ‘

Hungarians).’’

According to a photocopy of
the confidential list obtained by
reporters, Waldheim stood ac-
cused by Yugoslavia of ”murder,
putting to death of hostages” dur-
ing his unit’s merciless campaign
against Yugoslav partisans be-
tween April of 1944 and May of
1945.

Waldheim’s wartime role did
not come to light until last year's
heated election for Austria's
presidency. Waldheim denied
the charges, but allegations that
he falsified his Nazi—era past were
a key issue in the campaign.

Following the disclosures on
Waldheim, Israel demanded that
the secret U.N. War Crimes Com-
mission files be opened. \.

U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar turned down the

request after polling the 17 war-

time allies who were represent-
ed on the commission between
1943 and 1948. With the excep-
tion of Australia, the former com-
mission members favored

At a news conference in New
York on March .24, Ambassador
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
said he had asked the U.N. chief
and 16 former commission mem-
bers, including the United States,
to reconsider their ruling on ac-
cess to the files.

Besides the United States and
Australia, the other commission
members were Belgium, Britain,
Canada, China, Czechoslovakia,
Denmark, France, Greece, India,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Poland
and Yugoslavia.

Netanyahu told reporters Is-
rael's Yad Vashem Holocaust
research center in Jerusalem had
made a preliminary study of 347
files obtained from U.N. archives.

The sampling, he said, indicat-
ed that ”there is an enormous
amount of invaluable new and
detailed information on the work-
ing of the [Nazi] extermination
machinery.”

A U.N. official, who insisted on
anonymity, said that by turning
over the 347 files it received from
the United Nations last year to
Yad Vashem for exhaustive study,
Israel was demonstrating that
present U.N. rules did not bar

‘ sion’s confidential files. Henot-

Reliance on calculators seen as a lifetime crutch

(AP) — The California Depart-
ment of Education ruled last year
that ”  before the end of the
sixth grade, students should have
calculators continuously availa-
ble for use in class, on homework
assignments and on tests.”

The question, ”|s this a good
idea and will it stimulate math
learning?” was posed to the 40
national winners in the 46th an-
nual Westinghouse Science Ta-
lent Search. The students, who

‘are completing high school and

range in age from 15 to 18, met
recently to receive $140,000 in
scholarships and cash awards for
their independent research
studies in the sciences and
mathematics.

Sixty percent of the 1987 Wes-
tinghouse winners clearly vetoed
calculator use by pre-teens.
While some predicted such ear-
ly use would transform the calcu-
lator from a ’’valuable tool” to a
”lifetime crutch,” others cited
potential intellectual, academic
and psychological damage to the
student.

Underdeveloped brain power
concerned the third-place
$15,000 scholarship winner, Al-
bert Jun—Wei Wong, 16, Oak
Ridge, Tenn., who said, ’’In sixth
grade, students are still develop-
ing their minds. If only for the
sake of forcing them to use their
brain power, calculators should
not be a necessity. There is also
the danger of using a calculator
without, knowing the why and
how of its function.”

Wong's Search project dealt

with biological Cybernetics. He
believes his investigation may
provide further insights into the
brain's complexities.

Loss of potential student capa-
bility and self-esteem were cited
by Jessica Lynn Jacobson, I8, who
lives in Orinda, Calif., and at-
tends Miramonte High School.

’’If students are always allowed
to use calculators, they will never
learn basic arithmetic — adding,
subtracting, multiplying and

I

dividing,’ she said. ”They will
never be confident without
checking their answers with a cal-
culator.”

For her project, Jacobson
studied daphnia, a type of fresh-
water crustacean (water flea).

”At the sixth—grade age, stu-
dents are not doing such complex
work that they need calculators to
ease the number—crunching,”
said Andrew Heafitz, 17, New-
ton, Mass., senior at Newton

South High School. ”Number—
crunching is what they are learn-
ing. To use calculators at such an
early age produces calculator-
dependent invalids.”

The first-place winner in the
Massachusetts State Science Fair
and the Navy National Science
Award Program, Heafitzl deve-
loped a rocket-launched motor-
driven aerial photography system
for his project.

Unhealthy student attitudes

NEA calls for better assessment

By William Foley

For The Pitt News

The National Education Associ-
ation recently announced the

results of a study group's findings

on what American school stu-
dents know and are able to do.

The study group, which was
appointed by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education, analyzed the
current method of assessing stu-
dents through the National As-
sessment of Education Progress
and subsequently offered its own
strategy for assessment.

The importance of expanding
the evaluation of student learning
was stressed. The study group
concluded that there is a great
need to know more about stu-
dents’ higher—order thinking
skills.

The group recommended that
the Department of Education cre-
ate an independent educational
assessment council.

It would be the responsibility of
the council to determine what
areas of learning require assess-
ment. The council would also
identify feasible achievement lev-
els for each age and grade level
tested.

While the NEA supports the
findings of the study group, the
general consensus is that this
council should be broadly based.
Representation should be drawn
from the group that is most
responsible for successful learn-
ing — the teachers.

Although the study group has
the NEA’s support, the National
Academy of Education and the
NEA share several well-founded
concerns. Both groups believe
that with the advent of new as-
sessment techniques, it would be-
come possible to compare scores
by state or district.

It is at this point that the com-
parisons become ripe for abuse
and do not necessarily improve

education. -

Another argument is that the
schools with more resources and
fewer problem students will con-
sistently rate well on the simple

‘comparisons based on assess-

ment scores. The NEA and NAEP
postulated that scores could be
better improved if states, districts
and schools systematically moni-
tored their own performance,
rather than that of their
neighbors.

Should the U.S. Department of
Education create an independent
educational assessment council?
Dr. Tony Nitko of Pitt's psychol-
ogy and education department
said, ”Yes, the Department of
Education should create an in-
dependent council, one that is
free of the bureaucracy of the
Education Department.  It
should contain eminent educa-
tors and representatives of the
public interest.”

about mathematics and lower
standards are consequences fore-
seen by Elizabeth Lee Wilmer. At
Stuyvesant High School in New
York City, this 16-year-old senior
is captain of her school's math
team, among other activities, but
always finds time for cross-
country running, bicycling and
extensive reading.

Wilmer received the second-
place $15,000 scholarship for a
mathematics project relating to
three—color theorems.

”Spend five years teaching the
kid arithmetic, and then tell him
or her, ’Hey, all that was really

‘useless, and you don't need it .

anyway.’ That's sure to develop
a great attitude toward math,”
she said.

On the other hand, the 22 per-
cent who favor calculator use by
preteens and the 18 percent who
were uncertain aren't convinced
that most students will react that
way. They believe that calculator
use at an early agewill benefit all
students in the long run, and may
even inspire more students to en.-
joy math.

Louise Chang, 17, Westmont,
|ll., approves for another~«rea__son.
”Calculators make it easier for in-
-structors to construct problems
and
material which can be covered in
a given amount of class, testing
or homework time,” she said.
She does favor ”some testing to

be conducted without calculators‘

to ensure students remember bas-
ic artihmetic.” -

Overseas Development Network
planning participation in Bike
Aid '87 fundraising project

By Anthony Wroten
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh is
a melting pot — students from all
over the world come to Pitt to
pursue a course of study.
However, Pitt also has its fair
share of students who choose to
travel abroad.

The Overseas Development
Network is an organization
which gives Pitt students the op-
portunity to do this, and at the
same time, help generate aware-
ness of global poverty.

As Marianne Johnson and her

cabin where Mass was to be
celebrated, they could hear a
strumming guitar.

i That was intended as a joke,
but Johnson, a Roman Catholic
for'all her 40 years, laughed un-
easily. This was no ordinary
Mass. It was her introduction to
a small denomination called the
American Catholic Church.

The church is a California-
based offshoot of the Old Cathol-

papal infallibility. Now it is

ODM is sponsoring their sec-

Yin Lim, an economics/social
development major from Malay-
sia, said she plans to be a part of
Bike-Aid '87 this summer. Lim,
who is enrolled in the Graduate
School of Public and Internation-
al Affairs program, said her in-
terest in international
development is what prompted
her to participate in the event. A

The participants in Bike-Aid '87
are expected to collect one dol-

lar per mile in pledges and dona-

tions, which translates to
anywhere between "$2,000 to
$3,600, depending upon which
of the five different routes are

taken. The routes include Seattle,
Wash.; Portland, Ore.; San Fran-
cisco and Los Angeles, Calif., and
Austin Texas. The ride will begin
June 17th, and all of the routes
will meet in Washington D.C. on
Aug. 12 and then ride together to
the United Nations in New York
City on Aug. 19.

”When ODN came to Pitt, I
saw the whole experience as be-
ing something for myself as well
as being a chance to see the Unit-
ed States,” said Lim.

Lim is currently sending out let-
ters to faculty requesting tax

conducted in English, is tradition-

questions of birth control,

However, the church opposes
abortion and women in the
priesthood.

In addition, while the.pope: is

prelates, his full authority is re-

Baseball season opens today in eight cities

By Ben Walker
AP Baseball Writer

Toronto's Jimmy Key is sched-
uled to throw the first pitch of the
1987 baseball season Monday,
the first time opening day has
started outside the United States.

Tim Raines, Bob Horner, Rich
Gedman and Ron Guidry, all of
them unsigned free agents, are
among the missing as the season
begins. There still was a question

of whether major-league umpires
would work or go on strike as
contract talks continued Sunday.

Rain and temperature in the
mid—40s are forecast at Exhibition
Stadium, where the Bluejays en-
tertain the Cleveland Indians and
Tom Candiotti at 12:35 p.m.
EDT. A crowd of more than
30,000 is expected to watch the

challengers. ~

By Ed Schuyler Jr.
AP Boxing Writer

LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Mar-
velous Marvin Hagler and Sugar
Ray Leonard will fight Monday
night in a match many people
wish had happened several years
ago and one some feel should not
be held at all.

For several years it looked as if
it would not happen, but it
wouldn't go away.

0 More on fight, page 19

’’If I had never fought Marvin,
it'd still be on my mind when I'm
60 years old,” Leonard said. ”I
have to think he feels the same
way  for money, ego and pride,
and it's Sugar Ray Leonard.”

”He wants the Leonard fight
more than any other fight,” said
Pat Petronelli, Hagler’s co-
manager. ”This was the fight that
got away.”

Leonard's eyes have been a
source of controversy ever since
he announced last May that he
would come out of retirement if
Hagler would fight him.

Critics feel Leonard is gambling
with his sight.

' Some boxing people worry that

_if Leonard gets hurt, it will in-

crease the pressure to ban box-
ing, which already is under fire
from such groups as the Ameri-
can Medical Association.

”The sport is going to survive
no matter what happens,”
Leonard said. He also has said,
”I’m upset that anyone would
think I would take an unreasona-
ble risk of injury."

Leonard, who retired in 1982,
was given a retinal examination
by three eye specialists before the
fight was announced in August.
He also passed a retinal exam or-
dered by the Nevada State Ath-
letic Commission Tuesday night.

a 2%—1’ favorite to win the sched-
uled 12—round bout at a sold-out
15,366—seat outdoor arena at
Caesar's Palace.

”He’s the one that made the
choice.  My job is to defend the
world middleweight champi-
onship.” - I v

But should Leonard spring an
upset in the fight, which will start
about 8:15 PDT, he would be
recognized as champion only by
the World BoxingoCounci|.

The International Boxing Fed-
eration recognizes Hagler as
champion but is not sanctioning
the bout as a title match. If
Leonard wins, the IBF will
declare the title vacant. '

”This fight is not for money,”
Hagler said. ”This fight is to see
who is the best in the world.”

Money might not be at the

. heart of the two fighters’ desire to

meet, but the money is there in
abundance. Hagler is guaranteed
$12 million and also has a per-
centage deal. Leonard is guaran-
teed $11 million.

As to who is best, many box-
ing observers feel that both have
been better.

There is an adage in boxing
that you have to fight to be fight-
ing fit.

who will be 31 on May 17? It will
be only his second fight since he
knocked out Bruce Finch in a

Some boxing people feel that
Hagler, 32, showed signs of slip-
ping when he scored an 11th-
round knockout over John ”The
Beast” Mugabi, last March. They
also note he has had only one
fight in each of the past two years.

Slam dunk contest highlight of Ro

By John Enright

Sports Editor

High school basketball tourna-
ment games can be fun to watch
— for about two minutes.

The games are nothing more
than a showcase of individual tal-
ent and, since the majority of the
players aren't familiar with one
another, the games get sloppy
awful fast.

As Pitt recruit Sean Miller said,

’’In these games, a lot of individu—-

als will take over. They_just get
the ball from the beginning and
go. That's why a lot of guards get
taken out of a game like this.”
For the statisticians out there,
here's the final scores of Friday
night's games at the 23rd annual

Dapper Dan Roundball Classic — '

City/West Penn All-Stars 92,
WPIAL Quad-A All-Stars 91 and
U.S. West All-Stars 110, U.S. East
Now here's what really
happened:

0 For the first time since 1979,
there was a slam—dunk contest in
between games. Eight players
(five from the West team and

 

Sean Miller

three from the East squad) partic-
ipated.

Sean Green, a 6-6 forward from
Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of
Wilson, Va., was the winner. He
scored a perfect 100 in the final
round with two awesome dunks.
Green jumped over Pitt recruit
Darelle Porter, who was seated in
a chair eight feet from the hoop,
and dunked as the crowd went

wild. For an encore, Green
leaped over a cameraman that
was kneeling on the floor eight
feet from the basket.

Green may have won the con-
test, but Kentucky recruit Eric
Manuel was the best dunker in
the game as, he made two in-
your—face jams and was fouled on
both.

By the way, the worst dunker
of the night had to be Pitt recruit
Brian Shorter. He made two of
the most basic, simplistic dunks
in the contest. They were so bad
that he was given scores of 37
and 38 (out of 50). In his last at-
tempt, he tried to dunk two balls
simultaneously, but missed.

Said Shorter after the game, ’’I
didn't even want to be in the
thing. I can't do all that fancy
stuff.”

0 Marcus Liberty, who is gener-
ally considered the best prospect
in the nation this year, was MVP

for the West squad as he scored‘

24 points.

Liberty is headed for Illinois,
where he should be a instant
starter. So how _did he become
such a great basketball player?

Penguins need lots of help for next year

(AP) — The Pittsburgh Pen-
guins’ season started with great
promise but ended in an al|-too-
familiar way — out of the NHL
playoffs.

When the Penguins finished
the season Saturday night with a
4-3 overtime victory over the
Detroit Red Wings, they were a
fifth-place team with a 30-38-12
record, and thejobs of Coach
Bob Berry and General Manager
Eddie Johnston were in jeopardy.

Berry declined to comment on
his future, saying that the matter
was out of his control. Team Vice
President J. Paul Martha also re-
fused to address the matter,
which means the final decision
concerning Berry and Johnston
likely rests with club owner Ed-
ward J. DeBartolo Sr.

Johnston set the tone for the
1986-87 Penguins at a preseason
media gathering, flatly announc-
ing that nothing less than a
playoff season was acceptable.

But after starting the season

Miller. '

Indeed. Shorter scored 19
points on nine‘ for 12 shooting
and grabbed eight rebounds for
the East squad, which lost to the
West 110-99. Shorter's perfor-
mance earned him the honor of
Most Valuable Player, and it was
the second consecutive year a Pitt
player has won an MVP at the
Roundball. Last season, Panther
freshman forward Rod Brookin
was MVP for the Pennsylvania
team.

Miller didn't have a big game
like Shorter. But, although he was
one of only three players to go
scoreless in the game, Miller
wasn't miffed. He said passing-
not scoring — will behis role at
Pitt. ’’I’m not going to be a big
scorer,” said Miller. ‘"1 get more
satisfaction with an assist. My tal-
ent is on the fastbreak and getting
the ball inside.”

That is something the Panthers

  

      
 

with seven consecutive victories
and an 8-1 record, the Penguins
failed to win more than two con-
secutive games the rest of the sea-
son. They missed the playoffs for
a fifth straight season, an NHL fu-
tility record matched only by the
New Jersey Devils.

”When you don't win more
than two games in a row over a
period of 55 or 60 games, maybe
you're not capable of winning,”
Berry said.

The Penguins lost star center
Mario Lemieux for 1 7 games with
a knee injury and bronchitis.

Without Lemieux, they were

3-9-5. But the Penguins struggled
even with Lemieux, whg was vot-
ed the starting center on the NHL
all-star team.

In eight divisional games dur-
ing the stretch d-rive, Lemieux
had one goal and five assists and
Pittsburgh went 1-6-1. Overall,-
the Penguins were 10-19-6
against the Patrick Division and
lost the season series to every op-

desperately need — a point guard
who can pass the ball really well.
This past season, point guard
Mike Goodson, who some feel is
more of an off-guard, did a good
job running the offense, but he
never showed. any cleverness in
dumping the ball down low to

Charles Smith and Lane. Plus, he _

rarely showed any creativity on
the break.

Quite simply, Goodson is not
a passer extraordinaire. Miller,
though, just could be.

But Miller wasn't the only’Pan-,

ther recruitin the Roundball who
showed he can pass. Darelle
Porter, a 6-4 guard from Pitts-
burgh's Perry High School, dis-
played his skills with a few fine
dishes, although he also had a
number of uneccessary passes
which turned into turnovers.

A Miller said, -”Dare|le is a good
passer. He's really clever on the
break.”

That may be what makes Miller

ponent but the Washington Cap-
itals, against whom they were
4-3.

”That’s where we lost it right
there,” defenseman Doug Bodg-
er said.

Last summer, the Penguins
used the fourth overall pick in the
draft to select defenseman Zarley
Zalapski. But Zalapski, who plans
to play in the 1988 Olympics,
chose not to sign, and the’Pen-
guins didn't add a single player
from the draft.

”We have to get some players

who know how to win, who have .

been in the playoffs,” Lemieux
said.

”We need another winger
capable of scoring 30 goals, and

‘we need more grinders,” said

center Dan Quinn, who came
from Calgary in a November
trade for former team captain
Mike Bullard.

’’I don't think we're as tough as
we should be. Maybe it's because
I come from a team where the

and Porter such fine additions to
the Pitt team. The Panthers al-
ready have numerous players
who can score — Demetreus
Gore, Smith, Lane and Brookin.
For Pitt coach Paul Evans to bring
in players who are strictly scorers
would have been disastrous.
There simply wouldn't be
enough basketballs.

But, instead he has added to his
talented squad two unselfish
players who look to pass before
looking to ‘shoot —— akrare com-
modity‘ in college basketball
these days. ' J

Evans said at the beginning of
last season that the Panthers were
a weak passing team. And,
although they improved during
the course of the year, there is still
much room for improvement in
that area.

It appears that Miller and Port-
er, along with a clever passer like
Lane, should fill that room quite
nicely.

grinders probably won as many
games as the goal scorers did,”
Quinn said.

’’I don't know if there are go-
ing to be a lot of changes but
there’ll be some movement,
sure,” winger Randy Cunney-
worth said. ’’I couldn't say if it's
the coaching staff or players, but
no one’s job is really secure.”

Quinn and Cunneyworth were
two bright spots as both enjoyed
career-best seasons. Quinn had
31 goals and'80 points (28 and
71 with Pittsburgh) and Cunney-
worth, with 26 goals and 53
points, was the most productive
winger.

Lemieux, in his third season,
led the team with a career-high
54 goals, but his assist total
dropped from 93 to 53.

Left wing Terry Ruskowski’s
goal production declined to 14
from 26. Craig Simpson, a center
switched to right wing by neces-
sity, was the only other wing to

.15

score consistently, scoring 26
goals and 51 points.

’’I think one thing we need is
a witch doctor to get rid of all the
injuries,” Ruskowski said. ”That’s
the biggest thing, along with
frame of mind. We need to be
more confident. We had too
many peaks and valleys. We
have to be more consistent.”

The Penguins’ biggest success
came at the gate, where 26 of the
40 home games were sellouts,
and the season total was a team
record 598,61 4. After filling only
about 40 percent of the Civic Are-
na’s seats four years ago, the.Pen-

guins played to 93 percent _.

Panther track team worth the right Price

By Sam Tallarico
Staff Writer

Although just a freshman, Pitt
track runner Dave Price isn't
about to let his inexperience
stand in his way.

Price, a computer science
major from Cardinal Hayes High
School in Bronx, N.Y., has been
making some heads spin this sea-
son, including his coach's.

”Dave has stepped right in as

I a freshman and has done a great

job for us,” said Pitt men's track
coach John Vasvary. ”He is on
the school record mile relay,

which he ran a 46.5. That’s as

 

M()NDAY,aAPRIlL 6 10 AM-7 PM

good as anyone’s ever done.”
Price's 46.5 indoor time in his
leg of the mile relay was the
fastest time ever in the 400—
meters at Pitt. This, however, is
not a school record since the time
occurred during the mile relay.
Price, nonetheless, ran that
time and it's his to keep, but he's
gone out and set two more Pitt
records. .
In the |C4A meet in Boston, Joe
Turner, Vernon Reed, Jesse
Mikell and Price ran the mile re-
lay in 3:13.71 and came away
with a sixth-place finish. They
may have placed as high as sec-
ond had Turner not been pushed

In his first outdoor track meet
here at Pitt, Price was part of
another record.

Two weekends ago at the At-
lantic Coast Relays at North Caro-
lina State, Price, along with Eric
Cannon, Lee McRae and George
lfill, set the school record with a
time of 40.35. '

With this early success, Price is
looking ahead for the remaining
outdoor track season not only for
himself, but his teammates as
well.

”My goal is to make the nation-
als in June in" Louisiana,” said
Price. ”I think we have a good

chance of winning [the Big East

Championship] if everyone stays
healthy. If we stick together as a
team we should win.”

Price began running track in
the fifth grade and continued run-
ning in junior high because ”it
was something to do. It was fun,
so I stuck to it.”

At Cardinal Hayes, he was an
All—City and All-American track
runner, but it was more than this
that led Price to Pitt. ”I came be-
cause of Pitt's good track program
and [because] it's good academi-
cally,” said Price.

Vasvary has nothing but praise
for this up—and—coming track per-
former. ”He scored in the 400 [-

meter dash] at the Big East Cham-
pionships. He’s really a compe-
titor,” said Vasvary.

Some of the things Price likes
to do to unwind is playing basket-
ball, listening to music, watching
videos and working with com-
puters. But as for now, running is
most important to him, and it
shows.

”He is a force on the team and
in the conference. -I'm pleased
with his performance,” said
Vasvary.

Sanchez
aiming for
nationals

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
finished this season with a 9-6
record despite numerous injuries
to key performers, but there was
one individual whose perfor-
mance was very encouraging.

Jorge Sanchez, a junior from
Long Island, N.Y., had a solid sea-
son and has a good chance at
making the NCAA champion-
ships in the floor exercise later
this month.

But Sanchez’ road to gymnas-
tic success started in an unusual
way when he was in seventh
grade. ’’I used to be a boxer and,
through boxing — with the train-
ing and the conditioning you
have to do some running — one

‘of the coaches asked me to try
out for the track team,” said San-t

chez. ”So I did and then, after a
meet, one ofthose coaches asked
me to try gymnastics. He had a
program where you'd go in once
a week. Then I joined my junior
high [gymnastics] team.”

From there Sanchez, with some
help from his junior high coach
Joe DeVico, started to blossom.
”Joe’s the one who started me out
and opened my eyes to the
sport,” said Sanchez.

Sanchez said in high school, he
really started to do well in com-
petition. ”My junior year in high
school, I qualified for a regional
[United States Gymnastics Feder-
ation] team and went to England
to competeagainst their junior
national team. That was just the
greatest experience,” he said.

Sanchez decided to go to Pitt
because, ”I knew some of the

[guys on the team from compet-

ing against them through USGF.
Academically and athletically, it
was the best balanced school that
I had been to. And I liked the city
aspect of it.”

Judging from his success here,
one can see why Sanchez likes
Pitt. He has qualified for nation-
als the past two. seasons and
hopes to do the same this year.

Sanchez hopes to qualify in his
favorite event -— the floor exer-
cise — which he said is also the
easiest event for him.

But even an experienced gym-

THE - Pl1T* NEWS/Mom:lay,* April 6, 1987

Sanchez

Continued from page 16
nast has his difficulties. Sanchez
is no different. He said the most
difficult event for him is the pom-
mel horse. ’’It’s the only appara-
tus where you have to learn how
to swing horizontally,” said San-
chez. ”When you're used to do-
ing rings, parallel bars and high

J

bar, they are considered up and
down, whereas pommel horse is
considered side to side. It's just
a totally different technique from
what you have to learn for all the
other events.”

Sanchez wasn't satisfied with
the team's performance this year,
calling it ”shaky,” but he attribut-

ed a lot of the problems to inju-
ries. ’’It’s been real bad because
of all the injuries the team has
had to deal with,” he said. ”The
whole season we were worrying
about having a team represent
Pitt in every meet, so we had to
compete, not giving our injuries
a rest because we needed enough
guys to represent the team.”

And Sanchez himself was not
immune to the injury bug. Said
Sanchez, ”The killer for me this
year was injuries because if it
wasn't one thing, it was another
thing. It was my back in the be-
ginning of the year, then it was
my knee, and from then on just
compensating [for] those injuries,
I hurt other things and wasn't able

_ to get a rest.”

When Sanchez goes into a
meet, he said his goals are quite

 

 

simple. ’’I just want to be as con-
sistent as I can and to be able to
get through each routine clean-
ly," he said. On a larger scale,
though, Sanchez has one main
goal. ”[I want] to become an All—
American at nationals this year.”

Next season Sanchez will be a
senior, and he wants to be ready
to have a big year. ”I would like
to come back healthy and leave
healthy,” Sanchez said. ”We’ll
be a stronger team next year and
being healthy will help us reach
some of our aspirations.”

Sanchez thinks the comaradery
among team members was one of
the joys of being on this year’s
squad. ”This year has been great.
I would say this has been my best
year in the sense that we are a
team, not a bunch of individu-

I7

als,” said Sanchez. ”lt’s a really
close—knit, family type group of
guys. It's a give and take relation-
ship where we push each other.
So this has been a real positive
year in the team aspect.

”I feel that" I've gotten older.
The young guys are so vibrant
and just so into gymnastics that
they've brought more life into me
this year. By seeing how much
gymnastics means to them, it
made me see what gymnastics
means to me.”

Sanchez, who is majoring in
psychology, would like to con-
tinue in gymnastics after college.
”|’ve been in it for so long, I don't

‘know what I'm going to do

without it,” he said. ”Maybe
teach or coach. I would like to
stay here and help our guys.”

ried umbrellas.

Although the left-field fence
was only 265 feet from home

 
 

plate, neither team came close to ’

clearing the 23-foot wall built to
prevent an abundance of home
runs.

In the final exhibition game for

both teams, nobody seemed to
enjoy playing in the bitter cold
except Fernandez, who entered
the game with a 4.95 ERA.

The stocky left-hander held the
Phillies without a hit until two
outs in the bottom of the fifth. Af-
ter Steve Jeltz reached on an er-
ror by New York second
baseman Wally Backman, pinch-
hitter MiltThompson lined a sin-
gle to center field.

Chris James then fouled out,
and seconds later, McSherry put
a halt to the game.

The Mets scored the only run
of the game in the top of the first
inning. Mookie Wilson led off
with a double, moved to third on
a ground out and scored on Cart-
er's single to center.

New York threatened to in-
crease the margin in the fourth in-
ning, when singles by Carter and

Howard Johnson put runners at
first and third with two outs. The
rally ended, however, when
Rafael Santana grounded out.

Fernandez struck out seven and
allowed only four base runners in
improving his preseason record
to '3-2.

But while Fernandez used the
game as a springboard for the
regular season, officials in
Washington vying for a team af-

ter a 16-year hiatus cited the sell-
out crowd as evidence that the
city can indeed support a team.

Even Mets Manager Davey
Johnson expressed surprise that
the nation’s capital is still without
a team to call its own.

”|t’s hard for me to believe they
still don't have a team here,” he
said. ’’I always loved coming
here to play.” 2

Leonard's popularity with fans
is more incentive for Hagler

 

By Ed Schuyler Jr.

AP Boxing Writer

C LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Mar-
velous Marvin Hagler is aware of
Sugar Ray Leonard's popularity,
but he also is secure in his talent
and in his place in boxing.

”Just because he won a gold
medal and became America's
sweetheart doesn't mean I'm a
bum,” said the middleweight
champion, who will fight

Leonard in a scheduled 12—round
bout tonight at Caesar's Palace.

‘ 

I don't believe
[Leonard] has any busi-
ness in there with me
right now.

— Marvin Hagler
Leonard is coming out of retire-
ment for the challenge, and a lot
of boxing people think the
challenge is too late.

Leonard, who won a gold me-
dal in the Olympicsvalmost 12
years ago, has had just two fights
in almost 62 months. His last
fight was a ninth-round knockout
of Kevin Howard May 11, 1984.

’’I don't believe he has any bus-
iness in there with me right
now,” Hagler said. ”He’s been
sitting on the other side [outside]
of the ring [as a television boxing
analyst] and thinking he has the
tools to do it.

”That’s great. It makes me a lot
of money.”

Hagler is guaranteed $12 mil-
lion, and promoter Bob Arum
said that Hagler, who also has a
percentage deal, should getat
least $15 million. Leonard is
guaranteed $11 million. ‘

’’I need a new breath of air, like
something to motivate me,” Ha-
gler said of Leonard's challenge,
which has been criticized in
some quarters because of retinal
surgery on Leonard's left eye that

prompted him to retirein -1982. _

A win tonight by SugarRay Leonard would silence his critics who think he's in no shape to fight.

’’I’m not thinking about his
eye,” Hagler said. ”He’s the one
that made the choice. I'm going
in there to do a job. My job is to
defend the world middleweight
championship.”

Hagler is a 2-1 favorite for the

bout at a sold—out 15,300—seat

outdoor stadium. It is being sanc-
tioned as title fight by the World
Boxing Council.

The International Boxing Fed-
eration recognizes Hagler as
champion but would declare the
title vacant should Leonard win.‘

Leonard has said he doesn't
care what titles are at stake be-
cause the challenge of fighting
Hagler is enough for him.

Leonard also said he will retire
again, win or lose.

Asked about his plans, Hagler
said, ’’I like to take one step at a

time. I'll see what happens. I'm-

only two fights from breaking
Carlos Monzon’s record.”

Red Sox’ Stanley getting rarestarttoalay

By Rick Gano

AP Sports Writer

MILWAUKEE — The Boston
Red Sox, buoyed by the return of
star pitcher Roger Clemens, open
the defense of their American
League pennant Monday against
the youthful Milwaukee Brewers,
who have 14 players with less
than two years’ major league ex-
perience.

”There will be a lot of hoopla
and a lot of excitement for guys
on our club,’’ said Tom Trebel—
horn, the Brewers’ 39-year-old
rookie manager. ”|t’s exciting to
be playing the Red Sox. I'm sure
there will be some palpitations.”

A crowd of 53,000 is expected
at County Stadium for the opener,
with temperatures forecast in the
upper 40s to low 50s.

Cy Young Award winner and
Most Valuable Player last season
when he posted a 24-4 record,
ended a 29-day walkout over a
contract dispute and pitched six
hitless innings Saturday for
Boston's minor leaguers in an ex-
hibition game against Harvard
University. .
Right-hander Bob Stanley, who
has been in the Red Sox bullpen
the past six seasons, will start
Monday against left—hander Ted-
dy Higuera, who was 20-11 last
season. Stanley was 6-6 in 1986.
”|t’s great to be coming back as
a winner, but we have our work
cut out from the start,” said Red
Sox Manager John McNamara,
whose starting lineup is minus

unsigned free agent catcher Rich
Gedman.

”Everybody will be gunning for
us, starting with Milwaukee. We
had some nagging injuries and, of
course, the Clemens thing, but
overall it was a good spring. Now
it's time to start playing for real,’’
McNamara said.

Higuera, who held out for 13
days this spring in a contract dis-
pute, was 1-2 during the exhibi-
tion season and gave up seven
hits and six runs in his final out-
ing. But last season, he had a 2.79
ERA with 207 strikeouts and 15
complete games.

He will be facing a Red Sox
lineup led by three—time AL bat-

ting champion Wade Boggs and 

a trio of right—handed power hit-
ters in Jim Rice, Don Baylor and
Dwight Evans, who combined for
77 home runs and 301 RBIs last
season.

Milwaukee will open the sea-
son with three players on the dis-
abled ilist — designated hitter
Cecil Cooper and shortstops Er-
nest Riles and Edgar Diaz. Billy
Jo Robidoux will be the opening-
day designated hitter, while Dale
Sveum will start at shortstop.

Brewers second baseman Jim
Gantner, who underwent ar-
throscopic knee surgery March 3,
will also be in the starting lineup.

season as Toronto's manager, is
enthusiastic about the season.

’’I don't think we've ever had
such a competitive [spring train-
ing] camp,” ‘Williams said.
”There were some surprises and
some disappointments, but all in
all, I think we had a very good
camp.” ' .

For a team that has been criti-

-cized for not making personnel
changes, the Blue Jays have a

. fresh look in 1987. Eight players

—‘ pitchers John Cerutti, Joe John-
son, Jeff Musselman, Jose Nunez

and Duane Ward, infielders Fred T

McGriff and lMike Sharperson,
and catcher Matt Stark — were
not with the club when it opened
the 1986 season.

”Everybody says we don't
make enough changes, but one-
third of our opening-day team is
made up of guys who didn't start
with us last year,” Williams said.

Of the surprises to come out of
spring training, Williams rated
Stark’s promotion to the parent
club as the biggest.

”Not a surprise that he made
it,” Williams said, ”but a pleasant
surprise that he played so well.
He's a take-charge kind of guy
behind the plate.” 3 ,

Stark hit .375 with three home
runs and seven RBIs during spring
training.

’’It’s a dream come true,” Stark
said of making the team.

McGriff, in his fourth bid to
make the club, also was impres-

_ sive in spring training.
_ ”McGriff’s numbers are why —
he's here,” Williams said of the

first baseman, who hit .270 with
seven homers and 15 RBIs in
spring. training.

Williams said the American
League East would be a tough di-
vision this year, adding, ’’I think
our everyday lineup is as good as
anybody’s. We're as sound
defensively as we've ever been,
and we've got more speed."

, Wil|,iams’s opening-day lineup
has shortstop Tony Fernandez
leading off, followed’ by third
baseman Rance Mulliniks, center
fielder Lloyd Moseby, left fielder
George Bell, right fielder Jesse
Barfield, first baseman Willie Up-
shaw, Whitt and McGriff as the
designated hitter and Sharperson.

Cleveland's lineup is loaded
with power. It includes left fielder
Joe Carter, the major league lead-
er in RBIs with 121 who hit.302

Rose hopes his talented Reds won't
season's dismal start

repeat last

By Joe Kay

AP Sports Writer

CINCINNATI — Manager Pete
Rose hopes his Cincinnati Reds
ignore the calendar and pretend
it's autumn today when they play
their traditional National League
season-opener against the Mon-
treal Expos. _

Rose wants the Reds playing as
though it were in the heat of a
late-summer pennant race instead
of the April chill of opening day
to avoid a repeat of his team's big
chill of a year ago.

At the Astrodome, NL Cy
Young winner Scott will be trying
to repeat last season's perfor-
mance, when he went 18-10 and
led the majors with a 2.22 earned
run average and 306 strikeouts.

season in which he got little run

hoping that Pedro Guerrero,

Mike Scioscia have recovered

» The Reds, picked by many to
win the National League West

A last year, got off to a 6-19 start

that cooled their budding pen-
nant dreams.

As the slump deepened, Rose
warned his players that they
could bury themselves before the
first ofjune. He was prophetic —
the Reds’ closing flurry earned
them no better than a second-
place finish.

”Hopefully they learned you
can win a division in April and
May as easy as you can in August
and September,” Rose said.

against the Yankees, one of the
teams that spurned him in his off-
season free-agent search. Morris,
21-8 last year and the winningest
pitcher in majors during the
198.05, became a free agent after
the 1986 season and wanted to
join either the Yankees, Minneso-
ta, Philadelphia or California, but
he was turned down by each
team. a

Morris wound up going to sa-
lary arbitration and winning a
contract for $1.85 million.

Rasmussen, 18-6, will start for
New York in place of Rick

S'I'IlDEN'l'j JOBS!

The Cultural Resource Management program (CRMP),
Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh, is seeking
interested student applicants for temporary employment in
archaeology during the spring and summer, I987. About 100
positions are available for field technicians/excavators and
laboratory assistants at $5.75-$7.50/hour. Room and
transportation are included for field personnel. No previous
experience required; however, an introductory course in
archaeology is desirable. For further information, please
contact Dr. Tony Boldurian, 648-8764 between I :00 p.m. and
3:00 p.m. Monday-"Friday.

The Reds’ players seem to think
the poor 1986 start won't happen
again.

’’It was just a fluke that every-
body got off to such a bad start,”
said third baseman Buddy Bell.

For the second consecutive
opener, Rose will be strictly
managing.

He reluctantly removed himself
from the team's roster last fall to
protect a younger player, and
isn't eligible to be reinstated as a
player until May 15.

His main concern as manager
this year is his team's pitching.

burgh during the winter. Rhoden
suffered strained rib cage muscles
during spring training and may
not pitch for another week.

”Rick deserved to be the open-
ing day pitcher, but this probably
works out better for us, in the
long run,” Yankees Manager Lou
Piniella said.

Rasmussen, a left-hander, will

be followed by lefty Tommyjohn
in the series at Detroit. I

”Our guys have a terrible time
against left-handers,” Detroit
Manager Sparky Anderson said.

ARMY RESERVE OFFICERS’ TRAINING CORPS

Cincinnati is without right-
hander Mario Soto, rehabilitating‘
with a surgically repaired shoul-
der. The Reds hope Soto can re-
join the rotation in late April and
give it stability. They've named
only three starters so far — Tom
Browning, Bill Gullickson and
reliever-turned—starter Ted Power.

Soto had started five consecu-
tive openers, winning the last
four. Browning will pitch the
opener Monday. The left—hander
had a 14-13 record last year.

The city plans its customary
pregame parade and on-field fes-
tivities, but civic leaders are hop-
ing that the weather cooperates.
The forecast calls‘ for cool temper-
atures and a chance of rain.

Ueberroth is expected to attend
the Giants’ opener in Candlestick
Park, the team's 30th season in
San Francisco.

Teams that do not play Mon-
day‘ will open Tuesday. ‘The
World Series champion New
York Mets, with Bobby Ojeda
starting in place of Dwight Goo-
den, who is in drug rehabilitation,
play Pittsburgh (Bob Patterson).

When it comes to ‘appliances, every country makes its own rules.
Voltages, cycles, TV and video standards just aren’t the same overseas
as they are here in the USA. There are TVs and VCRS that work equally
well -both here and abroad, but you shouldn’t expect that your local

~ Sears will be able to supply your needs. . .Or even know what they are.
_ We know. Twenty-five years worth of experience makes us expert
in all the things you'll need to know.

We stock acomplete line of home appliances for £0 volts’, 50
cy_cles——-all major brands. Our large inventory assures prompt
shipment. And we can ship anywhere in the USA or worldwide if you
prefer—free of US taxes. I

With all that assurance, you'll be pleased to ﬁnd that our prices are
most competitive and our service is second to none. ‘
