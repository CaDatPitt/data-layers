Art Under Charles the Bold Featured

Beckwith Views Medieval Art

by PATTIE MCCAFFERTY

The court art done during the
reign of Charles the Bald in the
ninth century is among the most
intricate and lavish work of the
Middle Ages, according to Dr.
John Beckwith of the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London.

Beckwith, author of The Art of
Constantinople and Early Medie-
val Art, gave a brief family tree
to explain how the involved dy-
natic connections helped shape
the vast empire which Charles
was to rule.

“The grandson of Charle-
magne, Charles was able to
possess what is now modern
France and a great deal of West-
ern Europe besides, due to the
ploys of his mother and two stra-
tegically correct marriages,”
said Beckwith. _

The First Bible of Charles the
Bald contains an illustration of
the Bible being presented to
Charles Beckwith noted that this
is one of the earliest representa-
tions of a contemporary event in
Western medieval art.

Beckwith described the illustra-
tion in which Charles is portray-
ed in the same idealized fashion
as a protrait of David in another
section of the book. He said this
was probably intended to stress
the "New David" aspect of Car-
olingian political theory.

Much of the work of the Court
School is attributed to workshops
located in Metz and Saint-Denis.
It is difficult, Beckwith said, to
distinguish between schools and
to geographically place the court
center of art.

“The Court itself was constant-
ly on the move as Charles gained
more terriotory. Undoubtedly the
best artists affiliated with each
school moved with the Court."
said Beckwith.

The Coronation Sacrementary
is an example of a manuscript
which could have been done at any
of the various locations.

“The text seems to be unfin-
ished probably because of
Charles’ loss of Metz and the be-
ginning of the downfall of his
kingdom.”

An-ivory chair. formerly in the
Vatican. was revealed as the
throne of Charles the Bald in 1971.
The panels covering it show con-
stellations. centaurs. satyrs. my-
thological symbols. and a portrait
of Charles. '

"Who else but Charles would
want to elaborate so luxurious
an item '?" questioned Beckwith.

The school ended in 877 with
Charles’ death and constant bar-
barbie attacks on the kingdom.

"those families in New York that
Lucille used to work for," the
veterans plight—and as he spoke
his mind on these issues. his
audience wavered between laugh-
ter and attentive silence.

Dick Gregory, a well-known
comedian, political activist,
lecturer, and philosopher, de-
nies qualification. A man who is
obviously very upset with condi-
tions in the United States today,
he communicates his concern jok-
ingly “anytime Nixon says we’re
doing one thing, well then I
know we’re doing the opposite, so
anything this country says to do,
do just the opposite, and every-
thing will be o.k.”

Gregory continues in this vein
for quite a while. and then sud-
denly hits his audience with a
morbid statement like “The whole
world's gone crazy. Chances are
that 98 percent of _the colleges
open today willnot be open this
time next year." _ '

Hall who had been talking among
themselves and enjoying Gregory's
humor are suddenly silent. The

man himself changes his expression.

He is no longer smiling. his face
is suddenly full of creases and
frowns. "I wonder if you're clever
enough or old enough to under-
stand that the government's the
DuP'onts. the Carnegies. the
Mellons . . 

Gregory has nine children at
home and one on the way, and is
opposed to birth control. “Don’t
you know that if birth control
pills were good for you, you

~couldn’t get them like you-can’t

get anything else that’s good for
you." '

He labeled the government a
"sick. insane. degenerate system—
anything it can sell meis ailright.
but anything I can make on my
own is wrong." Cynically. rolling
his head to one side. Gregory
went on j'I figured as soon as they

Gregory talks of the stifling situ-

"When you start asking intelli-

you're annoying the class." He

maintains the only reason they .
haven't stopped him from speaking

Gregory explained that since
his mother used to work for a
rich and influential family, he is
safe. “They're so used to my
screaming around all the time,
they don’t even care anymore,
‘cause I don’t count.”

He repeatedly warned his audi-
ence to “watch them kids——tl1e kids

can't get caught in the same tricks
that you're caught in." He caution-
ed against the use of alcohol. say-
ing that "they're not going to make

Gregory commented that the
present_ generation is "nothing
more than the evolutionary pro-
cess. but the young kids behind
you. that's the revolution." ,

Speaking of the war, Gregory
emphasized the importance of
helping returning veterans. He
said that “there’s only one cat
standing between me and food, and
I can’t wait until he comes
home,” in reference to the fast
he has vowed to keep until all
prisoners of war are out of Viet-
nam.

"Reporters always ask me how
I feel since I‘ve’been lasting. and
they always look surprised
when I say hungry." said Gregory.

Concerned about the plight
of the returning POWs. he said

Gregory said that the “number
one problem in America today is
dumb, ignorant white folks—no, I
take that back, that's the number
two problem, the number one
problem is that you're dumb and
ignorant and you don’t even know
it.”

He stressed that whites keep
blaming their problems on blacks.
when it really is the fault of the
rich white families and the sys-

that—you get off my back. baby."

The audience_applauded this loudly.
Gregory spoke of the importance.
of nature. and said to "clean up I

your body and then you can't get
tricked. You've got to have a bal-
ance in your own head or you're
going to get tricked." ’

We can beat the system. he said.-

"if you white folks ever wake-up
and start thinking. we ca_n get
over this thing. by putting the

capitalists of the-system where’

they belong. and that's behind
the constitution and not in -front
ofit." _

A voice of relative reasonableness has finally
appeared among the chorus of prisoners released
as part of the \-"let .\'am settlement. Observers on
the left may speculate that it is simply the voice of
the one man who was not listening when the military
authorities coached the returnees: on the right it
may be suggested that the man is deranged. or that
he must have been brainwashed.

Most likely they are both wrong.
- The gentleman in question expressed his doubt
that the North Vietnamese and their allies hold a

A secret cache of unreported prisoners. Suppose, he

says, that an enemy airplane which has just bomb-
ed the steel mills in Pittsburgh is shot down. How
do you suppose the natives would treat the pilot?

An excellent‘ question._ I have often thought‘ it
'remarkable that there were any American prison-
~ers.«l learned a-good bit about casual savage-ry on
the streets of this country. in addition.‘authorities.
both academic and political. haveseen fit to posit
‘indifference to human life as one of the keys [0 un-
ugderstanding Oriental cultures. 1 ‘ l
A Sometliingi is wrong here. 1 know many Amer-
icans who would cheerfully. and -‘enthusiastically

lynch an enemy pilot" if they could get their hands-

on one. 'l‘liey_ would think less ‘unjust than shoot-

only Americans who are allowed to be outragedby

bombing attacks on their country.

part, hadfall their limbsiintact, and-had the use

 

 ............ A... AH...

Somehthing iswrong here. I am entirely certain
that. if we were being bombed. Richard Nixon
would be the very first to demand that "examples"
be made of any pilots we were lucky enough to shoot
down. —

. So far this sounds’ like polemic. and it prob-

— ably is. If the gentleman in the corner muttering
.about ':propaganda" will restrain himself. l will

continue.’

When I- began this little exercise,*I suggested
that bothof the most likely explanations of the pi-
lot’s statement were probably wrong. His mistake

was in making a statementrwhich failed to meet the

narrow ideologies of either side. He is probably

rightin his analysis, but it doesn’t matter; he is . '

likely to find real support only among those who are ,

not committed to defending their own particular
group of thugs. ‘ ’ ’ 7 -

u l have indicated that the American involvement
in Viet Nam was wrong. it was. fn addition. the‘po—
licies and actions of North Viet Nani toward its

v ‘neighbors have been consistently criminal. A third

party to the dispute. South \'iet Nam."is an affront

‘to humanity which. will make history books smell
~ bad for as long as they are published. i

‘ll’ a scale of‘ blame is to be established. we may

E be marginally ahead. but only because we are better

equipped technically for barbarity. _
Similarly, our prisonersgof war are not heroes.
For whatever reasons, . they willingly bombed a
small country with which we have never been at
war. Their only distiction is that they were caught
at it, and survived their captivity. _ ' V

Ho Chi Minh is neither hero nor iii'ai't-_\;r. He is ,

Record Quickies; “The Best of the Lcitest”

By BARBARA GERAUD

Many things have been liap-
pening the past couple months.
and it‘s been hard to keep up
with new releases. So here‘s a
brief rundown on the best of the
latest:

Duane Allman had to be one
of the greatest guitarists of all
time, and his untimely death
in October, 1971, left a void in
many groups——not only the All-
man Brothers Band, but for Eric
C1apton’s Derek and the Dom-
inoes and a host of others.

Capricorn has issued a collec-
tion. aptly entitled Duane All-
man Anthology, a collation of
the best of Duane's work. and
containing many tracks never
before released. Among them is
Aretha Franklins "The Weight.“
showing just. how great Lady
could really
sound the‘d done backup on
many of her albums. but no-
where else was his guitar allow-

ed to shine as well as ll did on
this track t.

Also previously unreleased are
“Mean Old World." a track with
liric Clapton. recorded in Octo-
ber 1970. and an Allman Broth-
ers one. "Don't Keep Me Won-
dering." recorded in .\larch.
1971.

“Layla,” of course, is includ-
ed, along with Wilson Pickett’s
“Hey Jude,” King Curtis’ “Gam-
es People Play,” and a magni-
ficent (thirteen) minutes of Boz
Scaggs’ “Loan Me A Dime.”
Duane was great while alive,
and this recording shows how
immortal he’ll be.

This ones been out for awhile.
but if the high cost has been
keeping you away from it. lind
some way to buy it—as well as
being a great record of Duanes
work. it will also serve as an ex-
posure to many artists yoti might
never- have thought of on your
own.

And while on the subject ol
great guitarists. don't buy Der-
ek and the Dominoes In Con-
cert if youre looking tor liye
"Layla". It ain't there. Some-
how. inexplicably and unfor-
giveably. a recording ol Clap-
tonis supergroup was released
without the song that first
brought them to the publics at-
tention and the one that was
probably the greatest thing they
ever did.

But if you can get past that,
this is one helluva great album.
Featuring the umpteenth ver-
sion of “Tell the Truth” and a
beautiful “Presence of the Lord,”
this shows both how great Clap-
ton is and how much greater he
can be (and was) when he work-
ed with Duane Allman or an-
other guitarist of whom he
could bounce his musical ideas.

If your only exposure to Clap-
ton as a solo artist was the
“Layla" single. this album would

APIRG is‘a Public ‘Interest Research
,Group. The PIRG concept ‘came from
Ralph Nader who has encouraged the for-
 -Imation of‘PIRGs across the country to deal
with ,'so'ci‘al problems in a~manner similar
V ‘to*h(is‘lown groups in Washington, D.C.

I V_\:P_IRG:s are student-controlled,. student-
fihanced, ’.no'n-profit. non-partisan corpora-
, tions. Most take in the college and univer-
,sit_v,studen(t's of entire states, but Pennsyl-
vania_is ‘splitiinto two VPIRGS. The one in
thiisvarea _is the -older of the, two and is
known--as-the Western Pennsylvania Public
Interest Research Group, or West Penn

' ‘V-PIRWG for _short.

.4-V-Student funding at the typical PIRG
-involves’ a voluntary fee on the academic
inyoice of collegesand universities whose
studei_it~bodies petition for that fee, The
fedis usually 'around’two dollars per term
and is -refunded in cash to students who do
-.-not -wish to'pa'rticipate. The funds so col-
lected are then used to pay a professional

 .. staff which works under student control.

I At the University of Pittsburgh, howev-
er, the‘~Board, of Trustees did not permit
the voluntary feeto be added, even though
‘,a_ majority 'of the student body had signed

reason given was that “legal, technica_l,
‘financial, and fiduciary” responsibilities
of the University made the imposition of
such a fee impossible. The Board and its
representatives refused to give moreide-
tailed analyses of its reasons, thus mak-
ing it impossible for PIRG lawyers to re-
fute their validity. It might be pointed
out in passing that thereiwere two state-
wide PIRGS in Oregon and_ Minnesota
then operating with the fee, and Pennsyl-
vania Attorney-General, J. Shane Creamer
had submitted a brief to. the_Trustees
pointing‘ out the legal’ safety of the Uni-
versityinadding the fee. ‘ ' .

‘ Since that time Carnegie-Mellon .Uni-',
versity has added the fee to its invoice on ’

a trial basis, while the Chatham College
Student Government has "made a $2,500
contribution which more than covers the
fees of the Chatham College Student Gov-

ernment has made a $2,500 contribution '

which more than covers the feesrof the

Did Irish Deserve To Be In NIT P

by VINCE Di NARDO

'l‘he Notre Dame basketball team came within
. one second of winning the 36th annual National In-
 vitational Tournament (NIT) the week of March
17-24 and then they only lost by a mere point. 92-91.
,‘ toga unheard of but gutty Virginia Tech Gobbler
’ team. ’

‘And. to think this writer had the audacity to
1 say ti-n a column on March 14—"NIT Pickings"i
 that the Irish were only picketed to sell tickets at
‘Madison Square Garden and that
. they did not belong there—a lot
 __ of other teams deserved the shot
I more. I
 I Three weeks_ later. after a near
 miss bythe Irish and four letters
" -to the editor later. I stand pat
with my opinion. Even though it

  

on that point. -The Irish win and because of their
glamorous tradition. they get breaks other schools—
who work just as hard—do not get.

I think Notre Dame. with Digger Phelps at the
help will soon be a national power to be contended
with. And you. can‘t take away the fact that the
Irish did play an extremely escruciating schedule.
But did they deserve to be in the NIT and did they
deserve to go as far as they did?

Let’s take a look. The Irish pulled off three up-
sets to get to the final and they game they lost they
were favorites. On March l7—St. Patrick’s Day-
they outdueled Southern California. In that game,
and "in the other three, ND enjoyed a decided ad-
vantage at the foul line. '

Against the Trojans the Irish had ten fouls call-
ed against them to 28 on the California team. Fur-

Louisville shot 3-5 from the charity line and ND
had 11-16 and an eight point win. The Irish were out-
shot from the field against North Carolina by two
FG’s. Yet, their 16-25 from the foul line was enough
to push them to a 78-71 win. I knew what I was say-
ing when I said that the Irish would win the first
game no matter what, but I didn’t think it would ex-
tend past that.

I'm not the only one who didn't think the Irish
should have stayed home. Sam Goldaper. a New
York Times sports writer. covering the NIT
(March 25) had this to say: "Itwas the third
straight upset for Notre Dame. which had been in-
cluded in the 16 tea-m field more for its ability to
sell tickets than its 14-11 record, A

And Phelpshimself was‘ surprised. 7’
“I’m very surprised to reach the NIT semi-

  

 

 has been proven to me that Notre Dame indeed
 6, must have a nationwide following. , ‘

y Actually, the only regret that I have about writ-
 ing the ‘column is that the impressioniwas gathered.

that I “hated” Notre Dame. Not so.

‘A A Notre Dame grad. Tom Williams. wrote that
 fithe Irish‘s only sin is winning.’ I agree with him.

ther. the Irish shot 25 of their free throws to only
two for Southern California.

-But maybe because it was St. Patty’s Day. the
South Benders won the the game by four. despite
the fact that they were outshot by a half dozen field
goals. And if my face was slapped when the Irish‘
were chosen to pla_y in the tourney. it was brutally
punched in that game.

Against Louisville, both teams shot 34 FG’s.

WASHINGTOi\' (AP; — Ameri-
top collegiate basketball
players probably will be able to
compete against the Soviet Union
later this month. a special House
education subcommittee was told
Monday. 

Walter Byers. executive direc-
tor ot the National Collegiate Ath—
letic Association. said the sub-
committee there would be no re-
prisals against the athletes nor
the schools it they participate In
the basketball tour.

All this is provided the Ama-
teur Athletic Union applies for

‘ NCAA sanction ofvthe games and
the sanction is granted. .

Attorneys for the AAU and
NCAA immediately huddled and
the AAU began completing the
required forms.

Byers. careful not to‘? promise
certification. told the subcommit-
tee the NCAA could make a de-
termination by Friday or Satur-
day. t

"We will not relax our rules and
regulations." Byers said.

Under the existing regulations,
however, Byers said, the tour
could be certified.

Under prodding by Rep. Peter
Peyser, R-N.Y.. Byers said NCAA

THE varsity baseball team will
s.wing into action on Thursday
when they travel to Indiana Uni-
versityof Pennsylvania for a
twinbill. The opening pitch of
the season is scheduled for 1
p.m.

The mitters will then travel to
' Steubenville on April 14.

rules did allow member student-
athletes to participate in the tour
if it was not billed as an "all-star"
team and it" the AAU asked for
certification.

Members of the subcommittee.

' including Reps. James G. O‘Hara.

D-Mich.. and John Dellenback. R-
Ore.. assured Byers they were
not attempting to force any stu-
dent-athletes into taking part in
the games. but rather were try-
ing to provide for them to do so‘
if they wished.

 

ANY intramural team that has

_ not forfeited any games should

Byers had questioned the effect
on the athletes’ studies if they
were to play. '

Bob Adams. commissioner of

the Atlantic Coast Conference.
testified that regardless of the

 

NCAA action. schools in the ACC
probably would not allow their
student-athletes to play since the
tour would come during exams.

‘Byers also cautioned the sub-

is sponsoring the-tour, has not
completed arrangements for all
of the games. Therefore, he said.

Coppertone is chock-full of cocoa" \

' butter and coconut oil and other soft,
