UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Posvar encourages
global interaction

By Pete Brasko III
AP Wire Editor

International. commerce pro-
ceeds more efficiently now than
ever before due to elaborate
telecommunications networks
termed the ”Global Interdepen-
dent System.” That was the
theme yesterday as Pitt President
Dr. Wesley Posvar addressed stu—
dents and faculty in the Kurtzman
Room of the Student Union as
part of a lecture sponsored by the
University Center for Internation-
al Studies.

”We must reshape the thinking
and perspective of Americans at
theearliest possible age,” Posvar
said.

According to Posvar, there is a
need for countries and scholars to
work more closely together in
order to provide guidance in
areas such as research and com-
munications, and Pitt is at the
heart of the ”internationa|iza—
tion” currently taking place.

Pitt has been the leader in the
field of international studies since
1968, when Posvar founded
UCIS in his first year as the
universitiy’s new chancellor. Pos-
va_r noted that UCIS is not just
theory oriented, but also involved
in solving the real-life problems
facing today's world.

”Scholars at universities in all
parts of the world greatly help

with international conflict resolu-
tion,” he said. ”For instance, the
best hope for peace in the Mid-
dle East is communication be-
tween the intellectuals at

_ universities in Cairo, Damascus,

Lebanon and Jerusalem.”

He said military leaders,
businessmen and university
professors and officials have held
successful conferences dealing
with such issues and problems.
Posvar also said that the balance
of power in the world is shifting.

”Soon," he said, ”there will be
a new world system with a mini-
mum of five or six great powers
instead of two.”

The United States’ role in such
a system would be vastly differ-
ent than what most Americans
are accustomed to, he said, be-
cause all the great powers would
have to make sure that no one
power became too powerful or

aggressive. He compared the sit-

uation to what Western Europe-
an powers did during the 18th,
19th and early 20th centuries.

Also speaking at the affair was
Dr. Burkhart Ho|zner,the Direc-
tor of UCIS since 1980.

Holzner said UCIS has gone
beyond his expectations, but the
battle isn't over yet.

”We must make our people
aware not only of the importance
of internati0nalism,”

NSN gains supportfrom Posvar

By Brendan Kevenides
and Pete Brasko III
The Pitt News

University of Pittsburgh
President Wesley Posvar
promised yesterday to look
into charges by-the Office of
Student Activities against the
New Student Network which
led to the group's suspension.

NSN representatives
brought up the matter of their
suspension at Posvar’s lecture
yesterday.

”I’m not totally aware yet of
all the details surrounding the
suspension,” Posvar said.

Posvar said that he sym-
pathized with the group's
goals and suggested that it
meet with the proper officials
from the Student Activities
Office.

According to Jay Katz, an
NSN member present at Pos-
var’s lecture, the group asked
Posvar whether he thought
world hunger was important
in a global perspective. Posvar
responded by saying that the

resorces are there, but distribu-
tion problems exist. The NSN
explained to Posvar that they
were working on those very is-
sues before they were sus-
pended from the university.

Posvar responded with in-
terest, according to Katz. He
said that he would take a look
at both sides before meeting
with John Ratchotte, NSN vice
president, to talk about getting
the group re-certified.

”It looks like Posvar’s on our
side,” said NSN member Bill
Page.

Posvar was unavailable for
further comment.

In response to Posvar’s state-
ments yesterday, Joseph
Cavalla, director of Student
Activities said, ”He’s the presi-
dent — decisions can be over-
turned. I did what I thought
was fair.”

In a meeting yesterday with
Cavalla, NSN members‘ and
officersdiscussed reasons for
their suspension and received
an official disclosure from
Cavalla.

/ response t0 a memo sent TO

The disclosure was in

Cavalla on April 1 asking for
reasons for their suspension in
writing. I

The disclosure read: ”Your
organization was decertified
because of two. requests by my
office that were not met. First,
the failure to complete the
necessary forms once your
structure was put up on the
Cathedral Lawn. Dr. Milani
[assistant director of Student
Activities] and I personally
delivered the necessary papers
to your group on Monday
morning and outlined the
procedure for filing. Even
though you attempted twice to
hand in the papers, you never
completed the process for us
to review your application.

”The second. reason is that
you failed to remove the struc-
ture at the time that you stat-
ed on your form and that you
were asked to do so by a" let-
ter that I delivered to the sight
on Friday, Feb. 26.”

BAS presents steering
committee candidates

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

Two new candidates were in-
troduced last night as the Black
Action Society held another
”Meet the Candidates” forum be-
fore their election scheduled for
today.

Celeste Myers and Shawn Wil-
Iiams were presented to approxi-
mately 30 students as the new
candidates for BAS chairperson
for the upcoming year.

Maria Kersey remains the only
nominee for deputy chairperson.
Myers and Kersey are running
mates in the campaign.

This meeting was a second at-
tempt to complete their election
process after having postponed
elections last month due to ‘a lack
of eligible candidates.

“After going to the first ’Meet

the Candidates,’ I felt I had a
responsibility to run,” said Myers.
”I have experience and I know
what's going on.”

Williams, chairperson of BAS’sl

Community Outreach Program,
said she feels there is a need to
restore some of the values we
stay away from.

Included in those values is the

need to ”better ourselves as stu— I
dents to help our community,”

said Williams, ’’There’s a certain
amount of bickering that happens
within an organization. We need
to clear up our differences.”

Myers, is currently the BAS
Financial Secretary and a resident
assistant, said he plans to elevate
interest and participation in BAS
if elected chairperson.

She said, ”BAS should take
responsibility and should guide
students.”

As an RA, Myers said she can
circulate information to all the
residence halls and hopefully get
more freshman informed and~in-
terested in BAS.

Kersey, the only returning can-
didate from the originally sched-
uled election, elaborated on
Myers ideas of generating interest

Surrogate mother gets unsupervised visitation

NEWARK, N.J. — A judge I
. Wednesday granted surrogate

mother Mary Beth Whitehead-
Gould immediate, unsupervised
visitation of six hours a week with
the child she agreed to bear un-
der a $10,000 contract.

Superior Court Judge Birger M.
Sween said Whitehead—Gou|d’s
visits with 2-year-old Melissa
Stern would be expanded from
one eight—hour day weekly to two
days every other week in Septem-
ber, overnight visits in April 1989
and two weeks during that
summer.

The judge also ordered the
adults in the case to undergo
counseling to ease the emotion-
al burden on the child, who lives
with her father, William Stern,
and his wife, Elizabeth. The
Stems, who hired Whitehead-
Gould as a surrogate, have cus-

In a statement issued by her at-

she washappy her relationship
with her daughter ”has been
preserved.”

The Stems’ lawyer has said the
couple did not plan to appeal
Sween’s decision, whatever the
outcome,

The Sterns argued that visita-
tion should be stopped for at least

six years, while Whitehead-

I Explosion rips base

housing Soviet troops

BUDAPEST, Hungary —- An ex-
plosion at a base for Soviet troops
in Hungary injured several peo-
ple today, the official MTI news
agency reported. I

In a terse, three—sentence
report, the agency said the explo-
sion occurred early this afternoon
at the Veszprem base some 60
miles southwest of Budapest.

The dispatch said the blast in-
jured ’’several people, including
one Hungarian citizen."

It added only that ”the conse-
quences of the explosion have
been eliminated."

No other information was im-
mediately available.

Lawmakers try to
solve drug problem

HARRISBURG — A bipartisan
group of Philadelphia lawmakers
Wednesday suggested ways to
stem drug-abuse problems within
the state, including establishing a
special office to head anti-drug
operations.

Sen. Hardy Williams, D-
Philadelphia, acknowledged the
proposals were in rough-hewn
form and that most of the sugges-
tions had not been drafted into

bills. However, he said the group
was attempting to force discus-
sion on the issue and generate a
dialogue with the Governor's
Office.

Among the group's proposals
were establishing an ”Office of
”Prexecutor,” which would both
prosecute drug cases and execute
drug enforcement policy. Other
suggestions included mandating
drug-education classes in public
schools; developing an anti—crack
strike force; and an income tax
form check-off that would desig-

’ nate part of a refund for drug

programs.

Pullin told U.S. District Judge

”Some management people

fied during a hearing to consider
Koppers’ request for an anti-
takeover iniunction.

Following the candidates’ plat-

A reoccurring topic mentioned
during this period was the need
to keep present students coming
back to Pitt.

Williams said in order to do
this, ”We need to be concerned

about the special needs of black

Kersey said ’’If we have a body

Nursing students from
around the country are in Pitts-
burgh this week for the 36th
Annual Convention of the Na-
tional Student Nurses’ Associ-
ation being held at the David
E. Lawrence Convention
Center.

The event kicked off yester-
day and will continue through
April 10.

According to B.J Nerone,

public relations consultant for
NSNA, over 1,500 students
are expected to attend the con-
vention. A large exhibition
will be set up to inform stu-
dents of job opportunities and
the NSNA House of Delegates
will hold an official meeting to
vote on resolutions, associa-
tion business and to elect
members of the 1988-1989
board of directors and
nominating and elections
Committee. Close to one
hundred speakers will ‘also
speak on various topics relat-
ed to nursing.

”The aim of the convention
is to test the leadership skills
of the students.,They will have
a say in issues relating to their
career,” Nerone said.

The NSNA, an organization
for student nurses based in
New York, was formed in
1952 to aid the development

Student nurses meet
atannualconvenﬁon

of nursing and has an all-
student board of directors.
Prospective members must be
undergraduate nursing stu-
dents. Currrently, the NSNA
has about 20,000 members
nationwide.

Nerone said the NSNA
holds conventions annually, in
a different city each year. ”We
rotate the conventions around
the country. Pennsylvania is a
strong constituency. Pittsburgh
met our needs,” said Nerone.

Nerone also said that this
year marks the first time the

convention has been held in s :

Pittsburgh.

A variety of educational fo-
cus sessions will be held dur-
ing the convention, including
critical care nursing, nursing
anesthesia, perioperative nurs-
ing and many others.

One of the speakers who
will be lecturing on ’’AIDS on
Campus” is Nancy Obus, an
associate professor at Pitt's
Graduate School of Psychiatry
and Mental Health at the
School of Nursing.

”My speech will deal with
nurses and anyone who cares
for AIDS patients,” said Obus.
”They have to take into ac-
count all aspects of the person,
what's going on psychologi-
cally and emotionally, so they
can take the best possible care

want to interfere?

George Shultz’s most recent trip to the Middle East, which
has included meetings with officials in Jordan and Israel as well
as an interview with editors of a Jordanian newspaper, has been,
by all accounts, a failure. ,

Shultz, understandably, has a different view of the matter.
Somehow, he seems to think that by choosing to ignore the
two most basic demands of the Palestinians — that the PLO
be included in negotiations and that consideration be given to
the prospect of an independent state — he will somehow find
the middle ground necessary for compromise. .

Shultz told reporters that an independent Palestinian state
would be ”unreasonable" and not economically viable. Which,
of course, means that it would not be in the best interests of
the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to be self-

governed.
Surely, Mr. Shultz.

The overriding consideration for the exclusion of the PLO
has been that they have demonstrated an interest in destroy-
ing Israel. A group that wants to interfere, possibly destroy, a
sovereign state? Like Nicaragua? Vietnam? The Philippines?

The mysteries of writing well

As if this clown’s name isn't in
print enough in Pittsburgh, now
you'll see it here. Write this
down: Michael Chabon.

That's right. Michael Chabon.
Got his photo on the cover of Pitt
Magazine. Got a writeup in In
Pittsburgh, probably the two
daily rags in this hick town, and
Better Homes and Gargoyles: His
agent has been working
overtime.

Take it from me, every writer in
town is eating his spleen out over
Chabon’s $155,000 advance on
his first novel, The Mystery of
Pittsburgh. l’m jealous, and I
doubt that I'll ever read his novel.

Chabon, age 24, is a Pitt gradu-
ate, neither of which I am. The
movie rights on his book are be-
ing discussed, and he's supposed
to have a hand in writing the
screenplay. _

As best as I can piece his plot
together, Chabon’s book deals

MARK
BROWN

with a young man's decision as
to whether or not he's going to lie
down with men or women
throughout the rest of his life.
And it's set in Pittsburgh! Thrill to
passages mentioning Panther
Hollow! Oh joy!

An undisclosed reader checked
out Chabon’s writing style and
found him lacking. That's one
person's opinion. Funny how
opinions like that haven't sur-
faced with all of the eyewash that
Chabon’s agent is spreading like
vaseli.ne over Pittsburgh.

I've busted my ass for over two
years on my books. I formed an
underground publishing compa-
ny to market them, and have
sweated blood while watching

how the receipts don't match the
outlay for advertising. Still no
review. The only agents in town
appear to be opportunists.
That's just one moaning from
the mire of underemployed

authors. Many more than me‘

have survived for years on one
meal a day, fired up by some
vague dream of success or at least
economic stability. We develop
drinking problems and fantasize
one last round of Russian
Roulette except we can't afford a
revolver.

We need discovered. We need
a fifteenth of a million dollar ad-

vance. We all want to be success- 4

fu_l, and we want to do it with
something more substantial than
a drawn out drama over whether
the main character turns queer or
not.

Nothing personal, Michael. If
you can write a novel, good for
you.

A request for thelegalization of marijuana

So, Nancy Reagan, l’m sup-
posed to ”just say ‘no’ ",when
somebody offers me drugs. Go to
hell.

I was sitting in a bar last week
when somebody passed me a
joint. I took a hit off of it and
laughed because I could have
been arrested for smoking it in
the first place, let alone smoking
it in public. The legal status of
marijuana is a joke.

I smoke marijuana, as do the
majority of the people whom I
know. I avoid people who don't.
We're not depraved dope fiends
as some would like the rest of the
country to believe.VPot smokers
are gentle, loving people. There
are a few bad apples in the

- basket, I'll admit. But pot smok-

ers are almost always good folk.

People who smoke pot gener-
ally don't get violent and don't
commit crimes. Can anyone say
the same about alcohol?

I can't back this up with any
stats, but I believe that more peo-
ple smoke marijuana than smoke
tobacco. That's a lot of people. If
”Should pot be legal?” were to

be put on a referendum, it would
pass tomorrow. What do you
think?

Marijuana is a good thing.

When l’m stressed out and want _

to relax, something as innocuous
as a bong hit gets me there. In
past times, a martini served the
same purpose. If this were 1888
instead of 1988, I would proba-
bly say the same thing about opi-
um, hashish or nitrous oxide.

The anti—drug forces claim that
nothing good ever came out of
drug use. Drugs turn people into
mindless idiots. Tell that to
Samuel Coleridge, whose Kubla
Khan came out of an opium high,
not a dream as we were taught in
high school English classes. What
of Edgar Allen Poe, opium addict
extraordinaire? I am not advocat-
ing the use of opium by any
means, but drugs can produce
good things. Listen to the music
of Crosby, Stills and Nash, or Si-
mon and Garfunkel or The Bea-

 
WALKING BY NIOONLIGI-I'I'

PAIIL ANA'I'ER

tles. Incredible stuff, and they all
used a variety of illicit phar-
maceuticals. Marijuana should be
legalized. If it were legal and
taxed, our economic woes would
be over.

Pot makes for good company.
It brings people closer together,
and in a much more meaningful
way than alcohol could ever
dream of. It doesn't leave you
with a hangover either.

l’m issuing a call for action
now. I want everyone who
smokes pot around here to begin
doing it in public. If everyone
does it, the police will be over-
whelmed. Cops rarely bust peo-
ple for marijuana anyhow, so it's
pretty safe. I also want everyone
who smokes to begin to support
NORML, the National Organiza-
tion for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws. They are the only lobbying
organization for this cause in the
country. Their address is; 2001 ’S’
St. N.W., Suite 640, Washington,

D.C. 20009. They do good work,
and if all of us band together, it
will be legal someday.

Aside from its fun uses in the
parlor, it's also pretty neat to have
in the kitchen.

Poultry Stuffing
5 cups rye bread crumbs
2 tablespoons poultry seasoning
‘/2 cup each of raisins and

almonds

‘/2 cup celery
‘/3 cup chopped onions
‘/2 cup chopped marijuana
2 tablespoons red wine

Mix it all together, then stuff it
in.

I got that recipe from The Anar-
chist Cookbook, by William
Powell. It may be in the library,
but if not, contact me, and I'll
pass on some more good recipes.

Sure, pot should be legalized,
pot's fun, and pot's meaningful,
but some folks don't know when
it's appropriate. Being high
reduces one's ability to function
normally. Therefore, I believe it
to be wrong to smoke pot before

work or school. Sure, you're gon-
na have fun if you do, but you're
going to end up hurting the peo-
ple around you with your ham-
pered performance. Pot should
never be used if its going to end
up hurting someone. Marijuana
has been maligned enough; don't
give non-users another excuse to
discriminate.

When Douglas Ginsburg pub-
licly announced that he smoked
pot in the past, he set a prece-
dent. He didn't get the Supreme
nomination because of it, but
something funny happened. The
American people didn't care, and
we also learned that even conser-
vatives get high. Ginsburg for
president, I say.

A whole lot of people are out
there getting high, more people
than the ”Just Say No" folks
could ever dream. We're out
there, but hidden. Come out of
hiding and get some work done.

Nancy Reagan said that anyone
who uses drugs participates in
murder. Nance, my taxes kill
more people than the joint I
smoked at that bar last Thursday.

Ride free.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 7, i988

Woman feels better without the hassle of a man 

Q: Why do I need a man? I had
two husbands, and both were a
constant irritation, but I feel lost
and alone by myself, even
though neither of them was good
husband material. Even my sex
life is better now, since I don’t de-
pend on a husband. I masturbate
once a month; it’s more
satisfying.

I have a good job, and I don’t
have to pick up after untidy men
and worry about their bringing
sexually transmitted diseases
home to me. No smelly pipes or
cigarettes stinking up the place,
no male nitwit to fall asleep
smoking and set the bed on fire.
No more stench of beer. I can
watch what I want on TV. Even
the money I earn is mine. Yet,
here I am, feeling deprived be-
cause I, have no man. I can’t
stand having them around, and
yet nothing takes their place.

A: I absolutely understand your
feelings, and you do for yourself
what I have often advised
bereaved women to do. Some-
times we have to live alone —— a
fact of life. And then we can think

up all the good things about be-

ing on our own. One of my con-
solations, when alone, is that I
can go through a museum at my
own pace, neither rushed nor
held back by a companion. Good
for you, that you know the good

DR. RUTH
WESTHEIMER

aspects of being alone.

Still, you have that lonely feel-
ing. What you should do is make
friends with some men who are
looking for companionship but
shy of making a commitment and
shy of sex because they are not
confident about it — a very large
category, and easy to locate in
any area. Have a man in for an
afternoon, then see what a sigh
of relief comes when the man
says goodbye and leaves.

This will be like the big sigh
grandparents give when the
grandchildren leave because they
love to see them come, and they
love to see them go home.
Maybe you need a man around
just enough to understand how
content you are without having

one underfoot all the time.

When you are making friends
with some men —- at a social club
or senior center -- see if you can
find any who want to see the
same TV programs you like, who
don't smoke or drink and who
have tidy habits. I personally
know they exist. It might be in-
teresting to have a relationship,
even a limited one, with a man
who lives without the habits that
annoy you. A man like that might
feel the way you do, not wanting
someone else in his living space
all the time, but ready to enjoy a
more limited companionship.

Q: Why is it that I go on hav-
ing an affair with a married man,
even though I know there is no
chance of a breakup between
him and his wife?

A: If you feel certain that there
is no chance of ever having him
to yourself, then this is self-
destructive behavior, and you
ought to explore it with a psy-
chotherapist.

But if you are sure no change
in your favoris coming, and still
you don't get out of that affair and
start looking for a man of your

own, it looks as though you have
a fear of a real committment. The
effort and risk of seeking some-
one else may be something you
would rather put off indefinitely.

I will not say that you don't

love this man, but the relation-
ship looks like a dead end for
you, and it is certainly time for
you to begin thinking of all the
other ways there are for you to go
with your life.
Q: My girlfriend asked me, final-
ly, why my male organ bends
downward when it is fully en-
gorged and if I have ever dis-
cussed ‘ it with a doctor. This
question no doubt was a burning
hole inside her for some time and
she finally came out with it. We
have sex regularly, and every-
thing works well, so it is only a
matter of the way it looks. I am
a medical student but I can find
nothing about this in any text.
Have you any information?

A: Only that l have questions
like this very often, and it seems
to be that sometimes the unusual
shape of the organ does not in-
terfere with good sex and some-
times it causes problems. I am
glad to address your query be-
cause it is encouraging to know
that you have no problem satis-
fying your girlfriend sexually,
only in satisfying her curiosity. As
a medical student, you will have

some oportunity to ask a urolo-
gist if this condition has a name
and where you can read up on it.
it doesn't seem to be a pressing
problem.

I know of a man who asked a
urologist why his male organ
went to the left when not erect.
The answer was that no one
knows, but if it is straight when
erect there is no problem. There

are also those that look ordinary «of.

when relaxed and go in various
directions when erect. l have
heard of this being no problem
sexually and also of problems
caused by it. A urologist has to be
the person to ask about this.

reports, seem to be neck-and-
neck to the finish line. Marcello
Mastroianni, a four-time nominee
but never a winner, could receive
the sentimental nod more so for
his career than for his perfor-
mance this year in Dark Eyes. But
if popularity is the name of the
game, it is a tossup between
Michael. Douglas’ brute turn in
Wall Street or Robin Williams’
almost wholly improvised Good

Best Bet: Michael Douglas in a

The Pitt News’ choice: Robin
Williams

0 Best Actress — This should
prove to be interesting. Everyone
thought Glenn Close would final-
ly get a statue for her psycho role
in Fatal Attraction. But then the
ever unsinkable Cher came
around with Moonstruck, as did
newcomer Holly Hunter with a
bravura performance in Broad-
cast News.

To top matters off, Sally Kirk-
land, the nominee nobody has
ever heard of, did a truly deserv-
ing job with Anna, and Meryl
Streep did her best work in years
in lronweed.

But when the smoke clears, it
seems a safe bet that this is Cher’s

lt’s the year of the Annes! Nomi-
nated are Anne Archer in Fatal
Attraction, Anne Southern in The
Whales of August and Anne Ram-
sey in Throw Momma from the
Train. And it's up to anyone to
pick one of them.

Only Olympia Dukakis (yes,
she's his cousin) in Moonstruck
poses any competition. Norma
Alleandro in Gaby is a write-off.

Boston's Salem 66 brings their
power jangle to The Deacade

By Manny Theiner
Staff Writer

When the world needs a break
from the trauma of noise but finds
no solace in sugary sweetness,
where can it turn? The answer to
that prayer is the coven from
Boston called Salem 66, who will
cross the threshold of The De-
cade on April 12.

Halfway between the pop jan-
gle of the Bangles and the raw
power of Frightwig lies the
stomping ground of Natural Dis-
asters, National Treasures, Salem
66's fourth album for Homestead
Records. Around a constantly
changing lineup, the rock—hard
convictions of guitarist Judy
Grunwald and bassist Beth
Kaplan, have been reflected in

at +lv¢

their heartfelt tunes.

A soft, yet tortured soul could
have produced these lines: The
truth is a marble/Inside your
head/It'll it rattle there/Until you
are dead. Yet energetic songs like
”|sabella” and ”Lucky Penny,”
though catchy indeed, ring true
in the eardrum like the loud and
free midwest honesty of Husker
Du.

Every song is riddled with simi-
larly enigmatic, introspective lyr-
ics, but behind the verbal veil are
obvious expressions of love, like
a secret that's waiting to be rev-
ealed and yet remains partly con-
cealed. One clue is embedded
the lament ”Eightball,” where
Judy relates: In the middle ofthe
field I lay/Waiting for somebody’s
hands to give me shape.

The warm distortions of Salem
66 give form to some dark, deep
longing within, only satisfied by
repeated listenings to Natural
Disasters.

Upon subsequent playings, the
second side opens readily into in-
telligent Celtic progressions on
’’Electric Avenue” (not a cover,
don't even think it) that keep jig-
ging along lightly into the haunt-
ing but livable ”Suffering
Bastard.” Nevertheless, attempts
to categorize their overall musi-
cal presentation as ”dreamy" fall
short because they could easily fit
in with a rocking version of ATS
that simply dropped the funny
songs. ‘

The record is not light fare; it's
a heavy guitar—propelled offering
for both the mind and the heart.
Congratulations to Homestead for
sticking with the germinal ideas
of Salem 66 and watching their
development. Their last LP, Fre-
quency and Urgency, stormed
the British and American press
and dented alternative radio. Fol-
lowing natural laws, this outing
should be even more fruitful.

In consideration of their current
tour, the operative rule tends to
be that a band with varied tonal-
ities often sounds more raucous
and munchy live than they do on
record. Salem 66 will probably
be no exception when they take
The Decade stage. There should
be no need for more than an oc-
casional quieting down; for those
who make a joyful noise find
happiness and bountiful love is
within.‘

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 7, I988

Two new Pittsburgh ban-ds make big promises

""By Nancy Brown

For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh's being invaded, and
many new music fans couldn't be
happier.

The Pleasure Heads and Fuse-
box, a.k.a. surf music from hell
and tough-edged pop, are the
newest sounds in the city.

It's all about eight musicians,

éour to each group, who have
come from remote corners of the
city, and the hands of such bands
as The Affordable Floors, North
by Northwest and Bone of Con-
tention who have gathered
together to "just hang out and
play music,” said Fusebox
guitarist Steve Morrison, former-
ly of The Affordable Floors.

The Pleasure Heads are
guitarists Patty and Deb, drum-
mer Elmo and bass player Erin.
They have joined the "first name

only” cult because their last

“names are "nobody's business,”

said Patty as she searched for the
album that would tell us how the
group chose their name. It is the
"Sometimes Pleasure Heads

Must Burn” cut from the Birthday
Party's LP that "conjured up
weird connotations and led to
our name,” said Patty, adding
that, "of course, not all pleasure
heads burn."

In describing their sound, Pat-
ty quickly replies that they are
"very influenced by Gary
Numan." ‘

"She's joking,” Deb was quick
.to assure. "We are inspired by
the Misfits. We're thrashfully fast
one minute and really bluesy the
next,” she added.

And although they got their
name from The Birthday Party
and are inspired by The Misfits,
it was through personal connec-
tions with the Heretics that they

V got together. "And it was The

Heretics’ basement and equip-
ment that we used to practice in
the beginning," said Deb.

And although they have only
been together a few months, they
have already appeared at the
Electric Banana, The Decade and
Squirrel Hill American Legion
hall and have produced a four-
track tape called, of course, The

Pleasure Heads. And Deb added
that the audiences’ responses
have been "surprisingly good.”

On the other end of the new
musical spectrum, we have Fuse-
box, who have come to us from
The Affordable Floors, North by
Northwest, Haywain and The
Mudbugs.

Fusebox guitarists are Steve
Morrison and John Young, bass
player Andy McDuffie and drum-
mer Matt Rutkowski.

While The Pleasure Heads bear
no last names as they zap us with

their thrashing Misfits metal,

Fusebox is "more in the Beatles
tradition,” said Morrrison, with
"tough-edged pop," added
Young.

They turned to a cousin for "ar-
tistic sensibilities” in choosing a

name, said Morrison, adding,
"Fusebox reminded us of elec-
tricity and vague sexual conno-
tations."

"So we knew we had to be
Fusebox," explained Young.

"Matt and Andy and I went to
high school together, and when

. they heard I quit the Floors, they

gave me a call in December to
come over and jam. We three
really clicked together, and in
February, we invited John to join
us," said Morrison.

"And the rest is history,” added
Young. ‘

Since they have all left previous
bands, Morrison said, "staying
together is always a concern 
but I like the attitude that it will
last for some time.”

”U|timately, of course, we'd

like a label  but we've never‘

changed anything for that, and
we play just to play right now,”
said Young.

"We want to be successful, but

we're not hell bent at producing -

a hit record at all costs. Fun is
first; success comes second,” ad-
ded Morrison.

Fusebox made its public debut
on Friday, March 25, at Friday
Night Live at the Concourse, in
the William Pitt Union.

Morrison hopes "now that peo-
ple have a vague idea of what
we're all about, we'll get a
chance to play a place like The
Decade."

With the talent in Fusebox, I
don't think they'll have to hop
for long. v

Jazz show explodes with sound

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

DiCesare-Engler Productions
brought "The Jazz Explosion" to
the Syria Mosque last Saturday
night, and it was a delightful time
for jazz enthusiasts in attendance.

Performing, in order of appear-
ance, were jazz greats Ramsey
Lewis, Freddie Hubbard, Stanley
Turrentine and Angela Bofill.

Lewis just finished recording an
album with the London Sympho-
ny Orchestra. Some of the songs
played by Lewis included "Ar-
mando's Rhumba" by Chick
Corea, several revival tunes and
"New York State of Mind,” or

something like that. Lewis also
played the James Mack tune,
”With a Gentle Touch," which
was downright beautiful.

Freddie Hubbard and his trum-
pet were next up, and he played
"Batt|e Scar Gelorica" and "Lit-
tle Sunflower."

Joining Hubbard on stage next
was Pittsburgh's own Stanley Tur-

rentine and his saxophone.

Together, they played "When All
Good Saints Come Marching
Home." Freddie then played solo
for a few tunes. His album, Won-
derland, was nominated for a
Grammy.

The final act was Angela Bofill,
with her wonderful singing voice

and stage presence. Between her
anecdotes of past relationships
(with musicians) gone sour,
Angela treated the audience to
Marvin Gaye's "Don't Mess
Around With Mr. T." She also
sang ''If I Could," written by Pat
Metheny, "Over the Moon and
Under the Stars," "Have Faith in
Me" and "Carousel".

Overall, it was a very pleasant
evening. The Mosque was not as
crowded as it might have been
because the show was the night
before Easter. Look forward to
some great jazz shows coming up
at the Mosque in the near future,
such as Spyro Gyro and the Man-
hattan Transfer. See you there.

 

    
    
 

FATAL ATTRACTION HAS BEEN
RESCHEDULED FOR THE FALL TERM

From Bolshoi to Benedum,

By Cathleen Karlsson
Staff Writer

It is not uncommon for us to be
concerned about our relations
with the Soviet Union. In fact, we
are flooded with television news
programs and specials enabling
us to get a closer view of the
country which — in one way or
another — interests us all, but we
are not often given the opportu-
nity to view the USSR in a less
political light.

However, on April 14 at Bene-
dum Center for the Performing‘
Arts, there will be a special
presentation of two Soviet ballet
dancers who have been brought
to the United States as part of a
non-profit, volunteer cultural ex-
change program developed by
Peace Links. They will be per-
forming_a|ong with the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre's production of
Valse Fantasie, Theme and Vari-
ations, and Petrouchka, running
from April 14 to '17.

The dancers, Irina Nestorova
and Igor Yurlov — chosen by the
director of the Bolshoi — are here
as the first of two phases of Peace
Links’ attempt to bring the Unit-
ed States and the Soviet Union
together peacefully. They said,
however, that they did not know
they would be coming to Pitts-
burgh until they arrived in the

United States. For the second-

phase (for which no dates have
been set), the program plans to
send two American ballet
dancers to perform in the USSR.

Nestorova and Yurlov arrived
in Pittsburgh April 3 but have ac-
tually been in America for the

past two weeks. Their first perfor-
mances were in Boston for Mak-
ing Music Together at the
American-Soviet Cultural Ex-
change Festival. After next week's
performance, they will take a
short sight-seeing trip to
Washington D.C. and prepare for
their return trip home. When
asked if they missed the Soviet
Union, Nestorova cited a Russi-
an saying: ’’It is good to be with
friends, but it's best at home.”

Since they have been in the
United States, they have ex-
perienced our way of life and
have enjoyed shopping for our
western clothing.

Nestorova had toured in the
United States before, but only to
Chicago, Los Angeles and New
York. She said, though, that she
won’t forget the view of Pitts-
burgh's skyline at night, or the
openness and smiles of people
she saw on the street.

Nestorova and Yurlov also at-
tended one of Pitt's Russian lan-
guage classes last night to talk
with and to the students, in their
native language. They discussed
how people in America are just
like those in the USSR. Yurlov ad-
ded, ’’I feel badly that our coun-

’ tries’ relations in the past were so

bad for so long, and I hope that
they will be better in the future.”

Both dancers were raised in
Moscow and attended the
Moscow School of Choreogra-
phy. There, they received top
honors for their individual abili-
ties and performances and then
joined the Bolshoi Theatre of

Opera and Ballet, Yurlov joining.

The idea of exchanging
dancers between our two coun-
tries was that of Loti Falk, the
former director of Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre. In 1985, she had
invited three Soviet guests to

was then that the idea which has
become known as ”Linking

was created.

TH E P-.lTT! -NEWS, Thursclay,-April 7,. 1988

 

By Susan Washburn

Assistant Showcase Editor

The City Theatre Company
closes its season with the produc-
tion of William Mastrosimone’s
Tamer of Horses. In this script,
Mastrosimone brings an intellec-

.‘1ual couple and an escapee from

a reform house together, a com-
bination that emphasizes both the
linguistic and cultural disparities
between two classes.
Mastrosimone’s script, while
focusing almost exclusively on
the relationship between the
males, examines the tensions in
each of the relationships in the
play, i.e. between husband and
wife, the two males, the woman
and the young thief and, of

‘Taming the wild instinct is not an easy task

13

As the young couple struggles
to rechannel the volatile emotion-
al energy in the street punk, they
experience conflicting feelings,
ranging from genuine fear of his
uncontrolled outbursts to a desire
to nurture the good qualities they
see "underneath the tough ex-

, terior.

Each of the parts demands a
great deal of energy as well as
versatility from the actor/actress,
and in the City Theatre produc-
tion, all three cast members meet
these‘ ‘requirements. '

The most outstanding perfor-
mance is given by Jonathan
Adams. Adams’ performance
swings from menacing to manic,
thus giving credibility to the fears
experienced by those around
him. Adams also expresses his

course, the group as ‘a whole.

character's (Hector’s) eagerness
to learn from those around him
as well as the frustration resulting
from the language barrier be-
tween him and Ty.

A teacher of classics whose
department has been phased out,
the unemployed Ty attempts to

’ educate Hector but is set back not

only by Hector’s inner-city jive
but also by his illiteracy.

David Butler as Ty expresses a
willingness to learn from Hector,
as well as to teach. Butler's per-
formance is honest and straight-
fnwanl murh like his character.

However, like Hector, Ty has
mistakes in his past that continue
to haunt him. Butler's character
is composed of dichotomies of
emotion that he controls with
precision.

Completing the cast is Maura
Minteer as Ty’s wife Georgianne.
Mi:iteer’s biggest problem is
created not by her performance
but by Mastrosimone’s treatment
of her character. Georgianne is in
many ways a whining wife who
imposes limits on her husband's
aspirations by constantly ques-
tioning his behavior. '

The relationship between Ty
and Georgianne is the weakest
one in the production. However,
when Georgianne’s fears about
Hector finally prove true, Min-
teer’s performance climaxes in
Georgianne’s emotional release.

Overall, Tamer of Horses at the

City Theatre is a powerful produ-
tion. Directed by Jed Harris, the
play is a combination of intracul-
tural and interpersonal tension
mixed with humor and affection,
resulting in a well-rounded even-
ing of theater.

Amy Seifried as Mary Warren in The Crucible.

By Patricia Lomando White
Staff Writer

”I’ve been a devout Miller fan
for years. He's my favorite Ameri-
can playwright,” said Scott
DeNier, a Ph.D. candidate at the
University of Pittsburgh, who will
exhibit this admiration as he
directs Arthur Miller's The Cruci-
ble, which will be previewing at
the Studio Theatre on April 6 and
closing Pitt's theater season.

Miller, who saw public terror
as a sin, wrote The Crucible in
response to the McCarthy hear-
ings held in the 19505. The play,
set in the Massachusetts of 1692
during the Salem Witch Trials,
draws a parallel between the two
chaotic time periods. In each
event, there are powerful,
authoritative men whose greed,
lust and personal vengeance rock
society.

DeNier’s interest in the play
began in the 1970s when

Thomas Eagleton was a potential
vice—presidential candidate. He
was dropped by the party when
they discovered he had a history
of mental disorder.

One of the things DeNier likes
about the play is its timelessness.
He'll be focusing on that in his
direction by using anachronistic
props and costume pieces. As
DeNier puts it, ”We want to re-
mind people that the crying of
witches is not exclusive to any

If

era.

Although DeNier has directed
many shows, including comedy,
drama and musicals, this is his
first Miller play. He says it's also
the first time ever that a produc-
tion like this has been done. His
staging uses the modern—day
equivalent of a Greek chorus to
interweave the narration.

DeNier, who could have used
the Stephen Foster Theatre for
this production, opted for the Stu-
dio Theatre because he felt that

and: Crucible opens in Studio

the wood and dark tones of the
basement theater lent themselves
nicely to the play’s theme.

The Crucible also presents
DeNier with challenges. ”I’ve
done shows with 100 people, so
I’m used to it, but scheduling is
maddening.” Another challenge

is the cast’s varying levels of ex-$8‘

perience. ”lf everybody works
toward the same goal, it seems to
happen, and everybody grows at
the same level. Acting is a craft
and has to be treated as such.”

While DeNier is an ex-
perienced director, directing is
not his only passion. He also
writes plays, some of which have
been produced in the Chicago
area.

What does he have to say
about writing and directing? ”It
[directing] keeps me in touch
with the actor’s dilemma.” He
said directing also helps him to
understand playwriting. ”I could
die contented if I left behind a

Death of a Salesman.”

The Crucible runs April 6-17
with the official opening on April
9. Student tickets are half price at
the door with student ID.

Women ’s track prepares for weekend meet

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

I The Lady" Panthers take to the

track this weekend at Pitt Stadi-
um. They will host four other
teams at 1 p.m. Saturday.

The Pitt team is youthful but is
strong competition, nevertheless.
In an outdoor season barely two
weeks old, three school records
have been broken.

Junior Gloria Azeke set a

school record in the 1,500—meter
run at the Atlantic Coast Relays
two weeks ago. She ran a time of

, 4:41.79 in the event.

In the same meet, the
800—meter relay team of freshman
Clarissa Dudley, junior Pat
Cupid, sophomore Vanessa Jones
and freshman Keisha Demas was
timed in at 1:38.69, which estab-
lished a new record.

The third Lady Panther record-
breaking performance occurred

Riddick ready, able to

«return to backfield for

sake of defensive team

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

When Pitt's football season
ended last year with a 33-27 loss
to Texas in the Bluebonnet Bowl,
so did the rushing careers of full-
backs Louis Riddick and Prentiss
Wright.

Kind of strange, considering
they were both freshmen.

Riddick and Wright are back in
uniform this year, however, but
at different positions —— in the
defensive backfield.

Riddick, 6—foot—3. and 210
pounds, finished third in rushing
last year with 175 yards, behind
only Craig Heyward and Adam
Walker. But despite his freshman
success, he is glad to be on the
other side of the bail this year.

"| feel a lot more at home
now,” Riddick said. ’’I’m really
happy with the way things are
going.”

Riddick proved that he could
play, defensive back as well as
fullback for Pitt last year, finish-
ing with 11 tackles and one
deflected pass in 10 games.

And with the graduation of four
of Pitt's outstanding defensive
backs —— Billy Owens, Gary
Richard, Quintin Jones and Teryl
Austin —— Riddick is set to step in
and assume a starting role in the
1988 Panther secondary.

Only one thing stands in his
way — Wright.

Wright, 5-10, 205 pounds, saw
action in all of Pitt's 12 games last
year, finishing sixth in rushing
with 55 yards, and making two

tackles and causing one fumble
on defense.

”There’s a battle [between us],
but we get along off the field. Ul-
timately, it's up to the coaches,"
Riddick said, referring to who
would start.

Defensive coordinator and
secondary coach John Fox isn't
too concerned about who will fill
the gaps created by the graduat-
ing seniors. '

”They both see themselves as
defensive backs, and they're both
pretty good players. They'll play
a lot of football. One’s gonna be
the starter, and one's gonna be
the backup. They'll be the guys,"
Fox said.

With only six spring practices
gone by, Fox said they are both
playing to their ability. "I don't
have any complaints. Right now,
they're right on target."

Riddick feels he still has to im-
prove his game, though. ”There’s
always room to improve," he
said. ”But all the keys and the
reads are coming along pretty
well, and I know the coaches
pretty well. I really didn't forget
any [plays] from last year."

The contributions Riddick and
Wright made to the team last year
weren't forgotten, either. Both
players were forced from the
secondary to the offensive back-
field when starting fullback Nate
Heyward suffered an injury in the
season‘ opener at Brigham Young.

”Last year, it was just a position
we needed depth at, at fullback,
and we had a lot of secondary

Please see Riddick, page 16

at the Atlantic Coast Relays.
Junior Hannah Russell, sopho-
more Robin Hubauer, freshman
Cathy Chrissos and Azeke set a
new standard in the 3,200—meter
relay, completing the distance in
9:15.64.

Pitt women's track coach Steve
Lewis is pointing with enthusiasm
to Saturday's meet. ’’If the
weather holds up, we are going
after some quality performances.
We are after times which will car-

ry us into championship meets.

”We could set a few new Pitt
records this weekend. Four, pos-
sibly five, school records are in
jeopardy this weekend,” ob-
served Lewis. V

Lewis expects the Lady Pan-
thers’ principal competition to be
provided by the women's team
from West Virginia. It could well
end up being a track version of
the Backyard Brawl.

West Virginia intermediate hur-

dler Connie Ellerbee is one of the
best in the East. She has narrow-
ly missed qualifying for the
NCAA Championships despite
the fact that the outdoor season
is just underway.

Two relay teams from West Vir-

ginia are among the tops in the t

region. They are the Lady Moun-
taineers’ 400-meter and one—mile
relay teams.
Lewis commented on a stand-

The following is, sadly, a true

Men's track team ready for Relays

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Panther Relays will be held
this Saturday at 1:00 p.m. and the
Pitt track team hope to turn in a
strong performance before the
home crowd.

The home team will be looking
for strong performances out of a
number of athletes.

I Freshman Elbert Ellis hopes to
continue his string of fine perfor-
mances in recent weeks. Just last
week he captured Outstanding
Male Athlete of the Meet at the
Colonial Relays. He captured the
110-meter high hurdles as well as
finishing second in the 400-meter
intermediate hurdles in the meet.

Pitt's Dave Price will be looked
to for a strong performance in the
400—meter at run, having already
qualified for the lC4A Champion-
ships in the event.

Dave Moore, a strong middle-
distance runner for the Panthers,
who also has proved an invalua-
ble help on several relay teams,
will miss the meet. He is out of
action with a strained achilles
tendon, suffered last week at the
Colonial Relays.

Pitt will field its usual strong
compliment of relay teams
although the individuals who will
race in each event have not been
decided upon yet.

Pitt coach John Vasvary noted,
”We are not concerned with
team scores in this event. We will
move some people around with
the Big East Championships in
mind. We are trying to see where
we can get maximum perfor-
mance out of our athletes.”

The West Virginia Moun-
taineers are expected to make a
strong showing.

Competing for West Virginia

will be sprinter Benny Cureton,
who has been a 200—meter dash
finalist in both the NCAA indoor
and outdoor meets.

Two Englishmen —— Dave
Hoinville and Ian Manners form

We are running at
home, a big plus. Our
track is fast. We will
have a good opportuni-
ty to perform well if the
weather cooperates.

—[ohn Vasvary

an outstanding middle—distance
running tandem for the Moun-
taineers.

West Virginia will be represent-

ed by Ed Smith in the hurdles. He
is considered one of the best in
the East.

The Mountaineers field two
very strong relay teams. The dis-
tance medley as well as the
6000—meter relay team has cap-
tured championships the last two
weeks. The victories occurred in
the Atlantic Coast Relays and the
Colonial Relays, respectively.

Vasvary will be looking for a
strong showing by his team.

”We are running at home, a
big plus. Our track is fast. We will
have a good opportunity to per-
form well if the weather cooper-

ates,” said Vasvary.

”Hopefully, we will get some
lC4A qualifying performances.
Maybe, if the action gets hot and
heavy, we will have some NCAA
qualifying performances,” he
added.

kids back,” Fox said. ”They were
needed there, and they're unself-
ish kids. They were happy to go
because they wanted to play, and
they didn’t care at what position
they played. They'd play at offen-
sive guard if they had to, but I
think they both see themselves as
defensive backs.”

Riddick agreed. ”Nate Hey-

ward got hurt, and they wanted
[me to move over there to gi\’i>“f*
their offense a little versatility,
and so I could get on the field a
little more. It worked out well be-
cause I got a lot of experience on
the field. It was good that I got all
that exposure, and I think it will
help out a lot.

If Riddick and Wright play like
they did in the offensive backfield
last year, then the Panther secon-
dary, which they were actually
recruited for, should again be a
force to reckon with.

Two other Lady Mountaineer
stalwarts to watch out for are
Melinda Case, a great heptatha—
lete and Claudette Rogers, one of
the East's best quarter—milers.

Lewis knows West Virginia will
provide a strong challenge for his
Lady Panthers. He hopes his
young team will be up to the
chaﬂenge.

O

Pitt defense to rely on youth
movement for upcoming season

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

Last season, the Pitt defense
was the strong point of the foot-
ball team. They finished in the
Top 10 in the country in overall
defense and pass defense. Play-
ers such as Zeke Gadson — team
leader with 137 tackles and in
sacks with 24.5 —— and Jon Cart-
er, 69 tackles, seemed to be a part
of every play.

‘ 

I think that the fresh-
men will be able to
make an impact on this
team. There won't be
too many people wor-
rying about a redshirt.

—lohn Fox

Now those players are gone.
Youth seems to be the name of
the game this season.

”We -lost a lot of quality back-
up players as well as starters,”
defensive coordinator John Fox
said. ’’In fact, we lost a total of
five linebackers, so we are a lit-
tle thin at that position right now.
Jerry Olsavsky is returning in the
middle, but he is the only one.
We are going to have to count on
some of the young guys.”

One of those young guys may
be linebacker Curtis Bray of Gate-
way High School. Bray is consi-
dered by many to be one of the
top scholastic players in the
country.

’’I think that the freshmen will
be able to make a big impact on
this team,” Fox said. "Maybe not
as a starter, but definitely as a
backup. There won't be too many
people worrying about a
redshirt.”

Hit even harder than the line-
backers by graduation are the
defensive backs. Troy Wasington
is the only returning starter from
last season, so he will be called
on to become a leader on the
field.

”We lost quite a bit of guys, but
one thing we didn't lose was the
coaching staff,” Washington said.
”That is going to make a differ-
ence. They can get everybody
ready for the season.”

”We lost some great guys, but
we also have some great guys
coming back. Louis Riddick is
over there, and Alonzo Hampton
and Robert Bradley and Cornell
Holloway, so those guys are no
slouches. They can match up
with Gary [Richard], Quinton
[lones], Billy Owens and Teryl
[Austin] too. So we'll be all right.

”Basical|y, I'll be in the same
situation as last season. If a guy
is out of position, it will be my
job to line them up straight. I wel-

come the challenge, but I think
by the time the season is ready,
the young guys will know what
they are doing.”

Last season, Holloway was
able to get time in every game,
finishing the year with 13 unas-
sisted tackles and one intercep-
tion. Riddick played most of the
last season as a running back, but
was recruited as a defensive
back.

Prentiss Wright, another run-
ning back last season, will also be
switching to defense. Bradley had
limited time last season, seeing
action in only eight games, but he
is beingcounted on during the
spring.

The defensive line also has an
unexpected hole to fill. Tony
Siragusa is expected to miss the
entire season after he has knee
surgery.

”We are a little bit better up
front than we were a year ago,”
Fox said. ”We are better off on
the line. Our guys have been
playing since they were fresh-
men, so they are used to the pres-
sure. We have some holes to fill,
but almost all of our backups are
returning. We should be all right
on the line.”

Defensive end Burt Grossman
finished sixth on the team last
year with 80 tackles, but he may
be best remembered for the two
field goals that he blocked against
Penn State. Even though it may
be a little early, Grossman feels
that the line is a little rusty.

”The defense looks all right/'0

Grossman said. ”Against'th‘e”6‘iTé
offense, we aren't looking that
good. But they didn't lose any
starters. While we're down seven
guys on defense, it's a little hard
to make up for that. Right now,
we look a little young. Once
everybody comes around, we'll
be all right.”

”We might be young, but we'll
be ready,” Wasington said. ’’I’m
ready to go now.”

Baseball team rallies
to defeat Penn State

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

Pitt's baseball team got on track
Tuesday with a big 13-6 win over
Penn State at Trees Field.

Pitt trailed down 6-5 in the
seventh inning when the Panthers
rallied. Denny Little singled to
center for the game winning RBI.

Head coach Bobby Lewis said,
”We’re starting to hit the ball. We
were down 5-1, but the kids
didn't give up; they hung in
there.” ,

Pitcher Frank Merigliano went
six innings, giving up six runs on
eight hits.

Doug Jackson entered in the
seventh inning and shut down
the Nittany Lions for the re-
mainder of the game. He allowed
only one hit with four strikeouts.
, ”l was glad to have the chance
to prove myself. We needed that
win,” said Jackson.

Several Panthers gave strong
performances with their bats,
which included Mike Claus, Matt
Bianco and Brian Lohman. Claus
was two—for—two, both home runs
with five RBIs. Bianco was four-
for—five with one RBI and Lohman
was four-for-five with two RBl’s.

”We got key hits when we
needed them. We had key RBl’s
with two outs. This is a big win,

drome is spreading throughout
college athletics. University of
New Orleans basketball coach
Art Tolis was fired last week af-
ter directing the Privateers to a
21-11 record and an invitation to
the NIT.

0 Seven—foot—one Tito Horford,
a sophomore center for the
University of Miami basketball
team, is going the hardship route
and making himself eligible for
the NBA draft. After thehighly
disappointing career he had with
the Hurricanes? Symptoms reveal
that this could be a severe case
of Benoit Benjamin Syndrome. At
this stage of his development,
CBA hardship might be a smart-
er move for Horford.

a momentum builder for this
weekend,” said Claus.

Overall, the Panthers collected
16 hits.

”We’re playing better and bet-
ter each game," said Lohman.
”We’re finally coming together as
a team.”

Pitt's record is now 2-1 0, while
Penn State fell to 6-20.

”We hit aggressively and we

had good pitching. Some people
came off the bench and did the
job," said Bianco.
' Today, the Panthers will host
Akron at 3 p.m. This weekend,
the Panthers will travel to Gear-
getown for a three—game Big East
series.
