Students often use a variety of ex-
cuses when they don’t complete
their work on time. “My dog ate my
homework,” “I left my notebook at
home” and “My printerwasn’t work-
ing” are token examples.

But for more than two weeks,
students and staff alike were able
to use a new excuse: “My govem—

‘ ment shut down.”

During the approXimately'two—
week government shutdown that
began on Oct. 1, government agency
websites were temporarily inacces-
sible to individuals seeking data that
these agencies typically provide. For
some classes or programs at Pitt that
depend on this data for their cur-
ricula, the virtual blackout posed
a problem. ° V

polished resumé could do the trick.
Tonight, students can rub shoulders
with specialists in creative careers.

Research studies entice students with credits, money

Sabrina Romano
Staff Writer

University campuses can be the feeding
grounds for researchers whose studies pro-
vide students with ways to earn an extra buck
or class credit _

Pitt students have three main options to
participate in research nearby — through
Pitt’s economics lab, Pitt’s psychology de-
partment and Carnegie Mellon’s Center for
Behavioral and Decision Research. Many
students don’t mind giving up their time for
monetary compensation or will participate
in social research for class credit or interest
in a topic. But according to experts, some of
these experiments may lack the validity of
natural science studies.

The Pittsburgh Experimental Economics
lab, which was established in 1988, conducts
social-science decision-making experiments

on Pitt undergraduates. The experiments are p

like those tested in game theory, which gen-

erally focuses on decisions made in social

interactions

Students create accounts and sign up for
the experiments online, and there are cur-
rently about 2,000 students in the partici-
pant pool. There is a guaranteed payment
of between $5 and $10 for participants,_but

they can earn more money if they make the-

“correct decisions” in the respective study:
The Center for Behavioral and Decision
Research at Carnegie Mellon University con-
ducts research on decision-making, judg-
ment and market research. Participants in

the center’s research studies sign up online,
and comprise both students and Pittsburgh
residents. V _

Emily Chase, a sophomore rehabilitation
sciences major, participates in research stud-
ies throughthe Pittsburgh Experimental Eco-
nomics Lab and CMU°s Center for Behavioral
and Decision Research. By participating in
these research studies, she has added $200 to
her pocket since last spring. She participates
in two studies per month because she said they
provide “an easy way to make money without
actually getting a job.”

Ben Wahlberg, a junior psychology major,
and Brenna Six, a junior communications
and psychology major, also participated in
studies, but, unlike Chase, they did so with
no potential for cash payments. Instead, they

participated to earn required credit for their
Introduction to Psychology classes.
Undergraduate Motives
Though Wahlberg participated in studies

' to fulﬁll the requirement for his psychology

class, he said that he does not have the time
to participate for the sake of earning money
or supporting research.

During the studies, Wahlbergwas asked to

' do a variety of things. In one study, he ﬁlled

out a questionnaire about his own long-term
relationships. In another, he wrote a few para-
graphs about the death penalty. Other partici-
pants, like Six, have answered online surveys
or played video games for credit.

that resulted in-the ﬁirloughing of about‘

800,000 workers, and several government

agencies were forced to cease their operations

’ due to a lack of funding until the Continu-

ing Appropriations Act 2014 was passed by
-Congress on Oct. 16.

These government agencies included
the U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Centers for Disease Control, Na-
tional Center for-Health Statistics, U.S. Census
Bureau and National Center for Education
Statistics. ‘ . '

Christina Das, a senior majoringin politics
and philosophy, encountered a problem in
her public service class. Her class typically
uses the most recent data from the CDC or
NIH websites, but without access, the stu-
dents used older data, predominantly from
2012. '

The CDC and'NIH post statistics online
about common illnesses, including diabetes
and heart disease, every month.

For Das, the use of older, possibly out-
dated statistics made the class experience
less beneﬁcial. She worried that studying

older information would jeopardize how job-
market-ready she was.

“Itreally isn’t conducive to learning about
what we can do today,” she said about using
past data during the shutdown. “We should
be using the most recent data.”

- The government-website outage also irn—
pacted students and professors in the urban
studies program, according to program direc-
tor William Chase.

Michael Glass, an urban studies professor,
teaches a seminar based on practical research
methods, and his students often utilize U.S.
Census data for projects.

For instance, students conducting re-
search on the Lawrenceville neighborhood
of Pittsburgh would typically verify that their
household samples were accurate by compar-
ing the samples to U.S. Census data. Because
of the shutdown, students could not conﬁrm
their compiled data.

The shutdown also aﬁected Pitt’s Univer-
sity Center for Social and Urban Research,
although the center’s core operations were
able to continue.

Essentially an intermediary, the center
makes information such as data from the Cen-
sus Bureau or the Bureau of Labor Statistics

available to individuals and organizations. As
a research affiliate of the Pennsylvania State
Data Center, the commonwealth’s official
source of data, the center is responsible for
disseminating census information. _

“For a.lot of our research, it is not a big
problem if the shutdown is temporary,” Chris-
topher Briem, a center economist said in an
email. “Once data comes back online, as long
as it is not an extended period, our normal
work will not be impacted.” '

Although the Center for Social and Urban
Research utilizes data from government pro-
grams, it solely relies on government websites
to access that data. The center already had

some data downloaded in various forms.

Pref-downloaded data did not save every-
one from the repercussions of the shutdown,
however.

Michael Ramsey, who teaches a geology
class on remote sensing, said his class could
not download necessary data in advance.
The graduate—level class requires students
to conduct an independent research project
using newly collected satellite data from a
massive database of archives.

Ramsey said that there is no way to pre-
download and save some of the data to use

at a later time. , .

While the data come from NASA, they
are stored in the U.S. Geological Society’s
Eros Data Center in Sioux Falls, S.D. Students
download the satellite images and use image-
processing software to analyze factors such as
land-cover change over time, deforestation,

urbanization and ‘natural—hazard impacts.

Ramsey received a notiﬁcation that these
sites would become inoperable less than one
hour before they shut down. He said that
the shutdown also compromised his own
research, which relies on near—real—time cov-
erage of active volcanic eruptions.

While the data is back online now, Ramsey
said the disturbance added stress to his stu-
dents, who were unable to access necessary
information for their assignments.

In Ramsey’s class, no contingency plan in
the event of a shutdown or similar occurrence
is possible due to the nature of the data, as the
data come from a live feed that constantly
updates. A

Although Glass said there is no plan in
place regarding government data in the
event of another shutdown, he did have one
sarcastic suggestion for his urban studies
class:“Move to Canada.” I

RESEARCH

For Wahlberg, participating in studies is im-
portant for psychology majors who will go on
to graduate school, where  be respon-
sible for settingup_ their own research studies.

“I think it’s good to see how it feels to be

a participant,” Wahlberg said.
Six agreed about the importance of under-

graduate involvement. The studies provide’

“students [with] the opportunity to observe
experimental research ﬁrsthan ,” she said

in an email.

Xiaofei Zhao, a junior communications
major, has taken part in four studies through
CMU’s center, earning almost $50. He also
has participated in previous _studies to ﬁilﬁll
a requirement in his Introduction to Psychol-
ogy class. " V

Tess Bailie, a lab manager at CMU’s cen-
ter, said that the participants are monetarily
compensated at a rate of $10 to $20 per hour.
On some occasions, CMU students are given
extra credit in a class if they partake in an
experiment. '

Jonathan Vallano, a Pit psychology pro-
fessor at both the Oakland and Greensburg
campuses, said utilizing student participants
in studies to earn credit is not done at Greens-
burg. '

“It’s a pretty standard requirement for
professors to get_ participants for their re-
search. It’s_been around quite awhile,” he said.

However, he conducts studies in Oakland
in which students receive credit for partici-
pating. .

“A lot of researchers don’t have the ﬁinds
to pay participants. That’s when it gets tricky.

Affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC is ranked among the nation'stop1O hospitals by US. News & World Report.

‘ [Researchers] have to find other ways to get

students to participate,” Vallano said.

Validity in Question _

Like all research, these studies aren’t fool-
proof. “

Wahlberg said that he felt he has par-
ticipated in poorly-designed studies. For‘
instance, one study tested a concept that he
had just learned in a psychology course. In
another, Wahlberg believed he had been as-
signed to the control group — the one that
receives either the standard or no treatment.

“If you understand the construct that is

being examined, then you can ﬁgure outwhat

they expect you to do and make sure you don’t
fall into that pitf ,” Wahlberg said.
Six agreed that there has been an artiﬁ-

. cial feel to the experiments in which she has
participated. H
‘ “Experiments don’t everfeel natural,” Six

said regarding the experiment in which she
played a video game.

Nancy Pfenning, a statistics professor at
Pitt, thinks that there are some problems with
the research done on campus.

“The No. 1 possible weakness for many
of their studies is a lack of realism,” Pfen-
ning said.

Pfenning referenced the idea that stud-
ies conducted in a contained laboratory are
not applicable to the -real world, due to the

constraints and restrictions contained within

astudy. T-

John Duffy, the lab director at Pitt’s eco-
nomics lab, recently conducted a study on
voters’ beliefs and their voting decisions.
The researchers tested whether there was
a correlation between the strength of an in-
dividual’s belief that his or her vote will be
pivotal and the likelihood that person goes to
the effort and costs of voting. Subjects were
asked about their beliefs and then separately
given the opportunity to purchase ‘tokens,’
which symbolized the cost of a vote. The pro-
tocol emphasized that the language usedwas
neutral, so as not to cue the subjects into the
social norms and expectations about voting
behavior.

' Pfenning referenced a lack of realism in
Duffy’s study. She said that during a study in
a group of 20, everyone’s vote matters.

She added that when you apply the situ-
ation to the real world, when there are thou-
sands of voters, each individual vote doesn’t
matter nearly as much.

RESEARCH

Duffy had an opposingview on the realism of
the undergraduate participant pool.

“As long as you’re 18 or older, you are quali-

ﬁed to vote, so undergrads are perfectly ﬁne
because they are voting—age people,”m Duffy
said. , l
b He said that if inconsistent results surface
in the lab after studying undergraduates, he
will likely get inconsistent results after study-
ing the general population.

“Undergrads are generally smarter than .

the person onthe street, so by using un_—
dergrads, weare giving the theory its best
chance,” Dulfy said. i -

Wahlbergdisagreed with Duﬂ'y’s views. He
said that a study’s ﬁndings carmot be applied
to a large population without awide range of
participants in the study.

“It’s hard to generalize results without a
wide age range — that’s what I learned in my
psych class, in research studies,” Wahlberg
said. V -

Six said that she thinks using undergradu-
ates in research studies is acceptable because
researchers who use paid participants address
their lack of a representative sample in their
report about their ﬁndings.

Despite some people’s concerns, Duffy
felt that research involvingundergraduates
can elucidate numerous types of research
concepts, from fundraising methods to game
theory.

“It is also possible to examine the impact

V of government policies inthe laboratory prior

to implementation to see whether they have

‘ intended effects on behavior,” Duffy said.

Duffy illustrated the importance of re-
search studies by relating it toa more com-
mercial idea: wind—tunnel testing of airplane
jets. »
‘ ou don’t want to be testingthe jet inthe
sky until it passes a test in the wind tunnel’
laboratory on the ground,” he said.

Psychology professors at Pitt believe that
the useﬁilness of undergraduates in studies
depends on what is being tested and the ap-

plication of the results. Vallano does research _

on Pitt undergraduates regardingpsychology
and law. Recently, he has been researching
if building rapport with witnesses of crimes
helps eyewitness memory.

As a legal psychologist, Vallano works with
trial attorneys to prepare cases for court. After
submitting his studies’ ﬁndings to judges, he
often ﬁnds hirnselfunder attack.

“We often hear from courts ‘You did this

researchwithundergraduates, not real jurors. .

How is that representative?” ’ Vallano said.
Although that is avalid question, Vallano
cited research revealing that when mock ju-
rors, such as undergraduates, and real jurors
are given the same stimulant, they act the
same way. _ ,
However, Vallano acknowledged that real
jurors making an important court decision
is different from undergraduates ‘making a
decision in a lab. ° r
“If you are asking the question: ‘How do
people make decisions in a death penalty

case?’ actual jurors are making a decision
where people live or die. With undergradu-

‘ ates, it is a simulated case and their decision

will not impact a life,” Vallano said.

He said that whether his research is used
in the court system depends on the judge.
The courts prefer when studies have high
ecological validity, meaning that a study ac-
curately replicates real-world conditions such
as population and environment.

“The lack of ecological validity makes it
easy for judges to ignore psychological re-
search or for expert testimony to be discred-
ited by opposing counsel.” Vallano said in

an email.

He said there is pressure in his ﬁeld to
start using real jurors as subjects in research
studies instead of undergraduates. '

Irene Frieze, a psychology professor at
Pitt, does research on undergraduate par-
ticipants.

“A recent study of mine asked about rea-
sons students are or are not interested in
exercise. Another asked about motives and
how these related to interest in study abroad
programs,” Frieze said.

Prescription drugs pose a serious
epidemic oncollege campuses

Brett Dresner
Columnist

Before I left forcollege, I sat down
with both of my parents for the “be
safe and responsible” chat. They
warned me about three things:

‘drinking, sex and studying. My

father urged me to drink in mod-
eration, while my mother politely
explained to me that she would cas-
trate me if; ever got a girl pregnant.
Then, both of them told me that col-
lege is supposed to be ﬁm, but I’rn
there to get an education.

While this was a chatI didn’tfor- _

get, there was one thing we never
discussed. Namely, prescription

1 drug abuse -—what the Centers for

Disease Control and Preventioncalls
the fastest growing problem in the
United States. ‘ _

In the U. S., a study done by
the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration
saw 9 million people, ages 18-25,
use prescription medication for
non-medical use. In Pennsylvania,

V_ the mortality rate from prescrip-

tion drug overdoses cameinat eight
deaths per 100,000 cases in 1999.
In 2010, that number rose 89 per-
cent to 15 deaths per 100,000 cases,
according to a-report by Trust for
America’s Health. That same year,
a study done by the CDC showed
more deaths from prescription drug
overdoses than car accidents.
Internationally, 80 percent of
the world’s pain medication is con-

sumed in the United States This

unbelievable consumption rate
only enhances the possibility for
drug abuse. In fact, someone over-
doses-on prescription drugs every
19 minutes, according to Dr.'Sanjay
Gupta, chief medical correspondent
for CNN.

Fatal overdoses from prescrip-
tion painkillers have more than
tripled since 1991, according to the
CDC. Sadly, people between 18 and
25 years of age make up the bulk of
that group.

While much of the focus has
surrounded prescription painkill-
ers, which cause more overdose
deaths “than cocaine and heroin

combined,” according to the CDC,
we as college students see other
types of prescription drug abuse
almost; daily. Adderall, Ritalin and
other “study drugs” are rampant
on college campuses, Pitt included.
This high frequency shouldn’t make
the use of such drugs acceptable.
In fact, we should be pursuing ini-
iiatives to diminish the abundance

of drug abuse on college campuses

nationwide. Although painkillers
and amphetamines are from differ-
ent drugfamilies and have diiferent
potentials for abuse, both have po-
tential for dependency. The National
Institute on Drug Abuse noted that
when a behavioral motivation to ob-
tainthe drugis formed, an addiction
to the drug quickly follows.

The world of prescription medi-
cation is aslippery slope for college
students who are under constant
pressure and continuously pressed
for time. What begins with taking
Adderall to study for an upcoming
midterm quickly becomes taking

DRESNER

Adderall to study for all of your midterms
and ﬁnals. The frequency of use explodes
once students realize they can increase their
concentration. Unvvisely, some people turn to
prescription drugs for help, and before they

"know it, they have lost control.

In 2010, ﬁve students at Columbia Uni-
versity were arrested after a ﬁve—month

New York City police investigation dubbed *

“Operation Ivy League,” which uncovered
a stash of prescription medications and il-
licit drugs along with thousands of dollars

in cash. The students involved included “a
neuroscience major, a former student coun-
cil vice-president, and a Gates Millennium
Scholarship recipient,” according to a New
York Timesarticle.

This year, Ohio State University held a
conference to address the growing abuse of
prescription medication by college students.
Morethanloo people from 27 campuses, in-
cluding about a dozen from Ohio, have signed
up to develop strategies to take back to their
schools, according to the Columbus Dispatch.
One of the proposed speakers at the confer-
ence, Karen Perry, who created the nonproﬁt
group Narcotics Overdose Prevention and

Educationin2oo4, lost her21year—old son to
a prescription drug overdose in 2003.

According to Perry, her son’s drug issues
began in college when he started to abuse
prescription painkillers.

As college‘ students, it is our job to look
after those closest to us — our friends. While
other universities work to ﬁx the issue, we
as Pitt students should begin to help out, as
well. Forums and task forces should be irnple—
mented to ensure that students are aware of

‘the dangers of prescription drugs while those

who use such drugs unlawfully can obtain help
to break that trend.
Prescription drug abuse has become an

epidemic, especially in college students, and
unfortunately, it is not something that can be
cured with vaccines. It begins with each and
every one of us takingthe time to understand
how dangerous these drugs can be and the
warning signs associated with abuse. We must
conduct initiatives that exemplify the works
of Ohio State University to at least begin the
conversation on the adverse eifects of drug
abuse. .No one ever wants to admit that they
have aproblem, but those people are out there
and in need of help. Ifwe educate ourselves,
then we can educate others, and together we
can eradicate such an epidemic. I

A€9’E Editor

With several Hollywood screenwriting
credits under his belt, it’s safe to say that
Steeltown Entertainment Project CEO, Pitt
senior lecturer and Pittsburgh native Carl
Kurlander has an idea of what makes for
a great story.

That’s why in 2005, when he learned
about Pitt’s celebration of the 50th an-
niversary of the Salk polio vaccine, he
jumped on the opportunity to seek out
one of the many members of the team and
the greater Pittsburgh community who
played a role in one of the greatest and
most dramatic medical breakthroughs
in human history.

What began as a small student project -

eight years ago has gained traction and
become an award—winning documentary
and, most recently, a national TV special.

October 24, 2013 I The Pitt News | vwv\/v.piitnevvs..c0m

Tonight, “A_Shot to Save the World”
will make its debut on the Smithsonian
Channel at 8 p.m. EST. The hour-long
documentary was produced by Kurlander,
former Pittsburgher and Steeltown advi-
sor Laura Davis and current Pitt Law pro—

' fessor Stephanie Dangel. The ﬁlm features _

interviews with a variety of individuals
who had a direct hand in the effort to de-
velop the vaccine, including Pitt professor
emeritus Julius Youngner andjohn Troan,
the former Pittsburgh Press editor who
followed Jonas Salk’s efforts to develop
the vaccine from start to ﬁnish.

The roots of the documentary can be
traced back to the efforts of Randy Juhl,
the Pitt vice chancellor for research con-
duct and former dean of Pitt’s pharmacy
school who during his time working as
the dean of the pharmacy school noticed
that, while students wandered through
the rooms of Salk Hall every day, few were

aware of‘Salk’s legacy at the sc 00 V. in
order to celebrate Salk’s legacy, he or-
ganized an event on April 12, 2000, to
dedicate a display to Salk on the fourth
ﬂoor of the building. .

What Juhl discovered was that Salk’s
legacy wasn’t simply lasting in medicine.
“There is still a network of people who
worked at Pitt at the time the polio"Ire-
‘search team was active,” Juhl said. ~ ,.;;

”Five years later, Juhl worked with
Chancellor Nordenberg to organize _a
university-wide event to celebrate the
50th anniversary of the vaccine. It was
here where he met Kurlander, who told
him “‘we should really tape this thing,”’
Juhl said.

Kurlander then assembled a team of
students to interview many of the at-
tendees of the event, including former
test subjects, Salk’s coworkers and other
doctors who had worked in the building.

        

Through these interviews, Kurlander was
able to learn about the attitudes and fears
that hung over the country as polio took
its deadly toll on young children.
Eachsummer for decades preceding
the Salk vaccine’s release, thousands of
children -—+ primarily under the age of 5
— were infected with the mysterious vi-
rus. Many died and thousands more were

paralyzed by the debilitating disease.

Juhl said that the effect the illness had
on the national psyche was tremendous.

“Here was this illness where one day
your child could be out playing  the next
they couldn’t raise their head off the pil-
low. They had to be quarantined, taken
to a hospital [and] put into an iron lung.
Maybe they recovered fully, maybe they
died or maybe they were somewherein
between,” Juhl said.

Someone Still Loves You Bo1fisYelt.sin:  name, polished sound

Vincent Smith
Staff Wrz'ter

Phil Dickey, the lead singer, guitarist and
occasional drummer of the band Someone
Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, has always
tried to “keep things simpliﬁed.”

A few years back, Dickey was holding
songwriting jams for little kids, where the
goal was for them to write a song a day.
Coincidentally, these jams happened right
around the time he was having writer’s
block.

“Seeing how easy it was for them to
just come up with a melody and start sing-
ing,” said Dickey. “It was kind of genius.”

That approach to songwriting — the
back—to-basics ethos -.— has helped de-
ﬁne the style of Dickey’s band, which is
on tour supporting the release of their
fourth album, Fly by Wire. SSLYBY will
be performing in the William Pitt Union
on Friday, Oct. 25. The show is_sponsored
by WPTS—FM, Pitt’s student-run radio
station.

Photo courtesy of Polyvinyl

Fly by Wire consists of 10 concise,
p,op—driven tracks_ that all rely on solid
hooks and catchy melodies. This time

around, the band incorporated far more

keyboard sounds and effects—laden vocals
than it had previously, making the record
arguably the band’s most polished work

Though their name is a mouthful,the+band’s sound keeps it simple‘.

 

to date. .
But Dickey said that was not the goal.

“We’ve never really been good at plan-.

ning things out, especially when it comes
to direction,” he said.

Di'ckey admits that the biggest concern
when putting together the album was

 

making something that didn’t “totally
suck.” And as far as the band’s members
are concerned, they were incredibly
proud of the ﬁnished product. “There
was really no doubt in my mind that it
was a winner,” Dickey said.

Dickey is personable, humorous and

- above all, humble. In his eyes, the acts of

touring and making records are both self-
rewarding ventures. Moreover, he feels
that reviews —— either good or bad ~— can
be inherently positive. “To have anyone
even know that you made a record,” he
said, “that’s pretty fortunate.”

With the release of the band’s fourth
album, Dickey continues to relish that he
is able to make music for a living. Dickey
said the band members would have been
skeptical if someone told them they’d still
be together after 13 years when they ﬁrst
began. It would have sounded “too good
to be true,” he said.

“This has really always been our dream
from when we were little kids,” he added.

How mustaches are experiencing a modern-day Renaissance

John Lavanga
A&3’E Editor

Of the roughly 100,-O00 hairs on the
typical human head, few are quite so
polarizing — and so frequently derided
— as that small cluster growing on the
upper lip that we call a mustache.

Now, after well more than a decade
of admonishment and mockery, the
mustache appears poised for another
Renaissance. With the establishment
of organizations such as Movember and
the proliferation of beard and mustache
clubs across the country —— including
Pittsburgh’s own Steel City Beard and
Mustache Club — mustaches are grow-
ing on faces and in popularity once again.

In the middle of the 20th century,
mustaches garnered a reputation as
the much-maligned facial adornment
of villains, despots and Groucho Marx.

Indeed, some of the most easily recog- -

nizable mustaches resided on the faces
of some of the world’s most evil men.
Fromjoseph Stalin’s robust brush of
lip fur to Adolf Hitler’s now-infamous
homage to Charlie Chaplin, the mustache

witnessed its once—proud reputation as ,

the centerpiece of the faces of countless
respected public ﬁgures, such as Clark
Gable and Theodore Roosevelt, sullied
by the actions of heartless dictators.
No longer was the mustache a thing to
be respected.

But this trend was reversed in the ’

coming decades, as the inﬂux of fresh
ideas and new ways of thinking allowed
an open—minded generation of youth to
shake the dirt from the mustache’s tar-
nished reputation and oncel again wear
it with pride. In the ensuing decades,
icons such as Tom Selleck, Sean Con-
nery, Frank Zappa and Lanny McDonald
helped put mustaches back where they
belonged. ‘ ‘ I

Today, the millennial generation
finds itself in a similar position as the
iconoclasts of the ’6os and ’7os.

In other words, it’s time to respect , I

the ’stache again. ,

In the ’9os, mustaches ohce again fell
by the pop-culture wayside. Perhaps the
most notable mustaches on television
belonged to Ned Flanders, Alex Trebek
and Saddam Hussein. Yet that tide is‘
turning, and the mustache is reasserting
itself as a force to be reckoned with in
the TV realm. The incredible popularity
of Nick Offerman’s “Parks and Recre-
ation” character, Ron Swanson, marked
a crucial turning point in that struggle.
Though Swanson himself is hilarious, his
trademark lip rug is worn without the

slightest hint of comedic irony.

Yet despite victories in the pop-cul-
ture realm, rank—and—ﬁle mustache wear-
ers_ of our generation are still the butt of
many jokes. If the mustache is going to

FILM REVIEW

Julian Assange biopic tries,
fails to exploit his infamy    

Jeff Ihaza
Stcyj” Wrz'ter

“The Fifth Estate”
Starring: Benedict Cum-
berbatch, Daniel Bruhi
Directed by: Bill Condon
Grade: D

Perhaps the shining achievement of
Wikileaks was releasing a leak prevent-
ing people from seeing a decidedly awful
movie about Wikileaks. A

“The Fifth Estate,” the latest ﬁlm
from Razzie Award winner Bill Condon,
attempts to market the story of Julian
Assange and Wikileaks in a package as
maddeningly simple as an infographic
attempting to explain string theory.
Benedict Cumberbatch’s performance as
Assange suffers the same cosmetic folly
as Leonardo DiCaprio’s role as J. Edgar

Hoover in 2o11’s “J. Edgar” but without .

the performance to back it up.
Overdramatic delivery and high-
school—theater—style makeup design make
for a performance akin to an SNL parody
of Assange, as opposed to a serious depic-
tion. Combined with the Hallmark-Chan—

A nel—worthy script (Condon did direct the

last Twilight movie), “The Fifth Estate”

falls short of the Bourne—esque thriller A

it wants to be.

‘Centered on one of Assange’s most
publicized leaks, video footage of thejuly
12, 2007, airstrike that killed two jour-
nalists working for Reuters, “The Fifth
Estate” doesn’t provide any new infor-
mation on Wikileaks, nor does it even
succeed as entertainment. Even when
dramatized on ﬁlm, “The Fifth Estate”
fails‘ to spend any time providing depth to
any of Assange’s leaks. Instead, audiences
are given a regrettable Australian accent
on an archetypical Mark Zuckerberg. As-
sange’s interaction with whistleblower

Chelsea Manning are glossed over in the
ﬁlm, replaced with loud talking and sultry
sex scenes that play out like a soap opera.

For cinematic purposes, these are
liberties that could be excusable if the
plot was driven by some other, equally
compelling force. Unfortunately for “The
Fifth Estate,” this isn’t the case. We’re
supposed to care about themelodrama
of nerds arguing about page hits and the
inﬂated ego of Assange, but the ﬂat, inhu-

man script —— a scene where Assange is ,

arguing with another reporter feels like
it came out of “Bring it On” — and over-
all bad acting make even this supposed
“inside story” feel bland.

The ﬁlm predictably follows the docu-

mented portions of Assange’s story, be— ‘

ginning in 2010, and uses ﬂashbacks (yes,
ﬂashbacks) to detail the information that
allegedly got Assange to the point he is
today. Sprinkled throughout the ﬁlm are
vignettes of Assange’s childhood, where
he was apparently involved in a cult that
causedhim to dye his hair.

The scenes follow the sort of mythic -

hero narrative from “The Dark Knight,”
seemingly as an attempt to illustrate
the larger-than—life nature of the ﬁlm’s
subject. Unfortunately, the only effect of
these cliches is a frustrating two hours
of overly serious facial expressions and
romanticized accounts of CNN headlines.

Yet the biggest mistake this ﬁlm makes
is its bald—faced attempt at banking on
the legacy of a decidedly nonproﬁt in-
stitution.

In May of this year, thousands of
people took to the streets of Istanbul
protesting a rangeof issues, from the
environment to freedom of speech. The
nature of these speciﬁc protests follows a

nuanced framework made possible by the H

Internet and social media. Unlike Latin
American social uprisings in the ’90s,
the protests in Turkey — and all over the
Arab world —— are particularly indebted to

t shifts in communication that have made .

their cries for change heard across the

SALK

Juhl described the iron lung as akin to
“a big soup can”,used as an early artiﬁcial-
respiration device for children whose
chest muscles had been paralyzed by the
virus. After being inserted into the iron
lung, with only their head protruding
from the device, air would be pumped in
and out of the chamber, collapsing and
expanding the chest until the child was
capable of breathing again.

If the muscles in the throat of the
infected person couldn’t stay open on
their own, however, doctors would per-
form a tracheotomy, in which a hole is
cut into the pati'ent’s trachea to open a
direct airway.

According to both Kurlander and
Juhl, it was easy for Salk’s team to-ﬁnd
motivation to work tirelessly on their
vaccine. As they toiled in the basement
of the Pittsburgh Municipal Hospital for
Contagious Diseases —— now referred to
as Salk Hall -— doctors three ﬂoors above
were performing tracheotomies on small
children every day as the number of .vic-

tims steadily rose.

The following semester, Kurlander
worked with a team of students to create
a brief trailer of their footage. However,
what began as simply a class project be-
came much more when Pitt alumnus and
Lionsgate executive John Dellaverson saw
the trailer and suggested it be expanded
into a full-length documentary. '

“John [Dellaverson] was the one who
was the inspiration. He’s the one who

‘saw the trailer and said ‘this could be a

movie,”’ Kurlander said.

Thus, after teaming up with Davis,
Dangel and director Tjardus Greidanus,
Kurlander set out to produce a 2010 docu-

A mentary entitled “The Shot Felt ’Round

the World” that went beyond Salk’s work
in the lab to explore the way that this fear
and the concerted efforts of the March
of Dimes created a powerful movement
to eradicate the disease. According to
Kurlander, the ﬁlm traces these causes
of the cure in order to show viewers that

“When you work together and ﬁnd com— '

mon ground, you can literally change the
world.”
Jane Smith, a professor of history at

Wat-Vﬁwi

Northwestern University and author of
“Patenting the Sun: Polio and the Salk
Vaccine,” noted that it is imperative to
highlight the collaborative efforts that
led to the vaccine. .

“A lot of the success of the polio vacci-
nation program was built on the goodwill
and cooperation of all the parents that
had volunteered their—child’ren,” Smith
said. I A »

Furthermore, Smith added that “if the
March of Dimes hadn’t been funding a lot
of the basic virus research, they wouldn’t
have had a group of scientists that would

"have known how to make a polio vaccine.”

In 2012, the documentary -won the
award for Best Documentary at the San
Luis Obispo ﬁlm festival. Shortly there-
after, the Smithsonian Channel made the
decision to pick up the documentary. In
adapting it for television, the Smithsonian
Channel not only edited thelength, they
also included footage on the modern ef-
forts by philanthropists such as Bill Gates
to eliminate polio from the earth entirely.

In making these scenes of the docu- ,

mentary, Kurlander was given 15 min-

utes to interview Gates. The prospect was

nerve-wracking. . .
“I can’t do anything in 15- minutes,”

' Kurlander said. _
As a result of the inspiration of Pitt.

alumni and the documentary team’s desire
to ﬁnd the hidden stories in the polio ef-
fort, “what started out as a student project
to document the contributions of the city
of Pittsburgh to the polio story became
a [full-length] documentary,”Juhl said.

The story of Salk’s breakthrough effort
to develop an effective and safe vaccine for
polio is well-known among Pitt students.
In Kurlander’s eyes, it’s the achievement
that truly sets the University of Pittsburgh
apart from any other university.

“Tell me the big diseases that George-
town cured, or Harvard, or Princeton. Pitt
is the only school in the world that can
really claim to have eradicated a disease.”

Forjuhl, however, the process of cre-
ating the documentary simply reiterates
the incredible nature of the campaign to
end polio.

“It’s taken longer to get [the documen-

.tary] on TV than it did for the polio virus
research team to eradicate polio from the
North American continent,” Juhl said.

MUSTACHE

the recent decades have been unkind to
mustaches, saying that during the late

' ’90s and early 2000s, the mustache was

replaced by the clean—cut trends of the
time. p T

Worse still, those who chose to rock
the mouth brow wore it as an ironic ac-
cessory and “never really embraced what
the mustache could stand for, which is

' just a giant centerpiece-in the middle

of your face that says ‘I am a man and I
embrace the sexually dynamic mustache
”’ Causgrove said.

tache Institute supports the cause is with
its annual ’Stache Bash. Held in-a differ-

ent city each year, the event celebrates _
mustache culture, raises money for a '

local charity and crowns the winner of

V the Robert Goulet Memorial Mustached

American of the Year Award, given to
“the person who best embodies the mus-
tached American lifestyle.” Past winners
have run the gamut, ranging from ﬁre-

SOFTBALL

Megan Boyle
Stzyff Writer

It’s the top of the ﬁfth inning on Sept. 29 and
Pitt’s softball team leads Youngstown State
by two runs. With the Panthers on the ﬁeld,
they have a chance to hold their opponent to
zero runs scored in the inning, giving them
an advantage in the last stretch of the game.

Youngstown State’s Courtney Ewing
walks up to the plate against Pitt junior
pitcher Alexa Larkin. One fast pitch and Ew-
ing makes direct contact with the ball — a
line drive to second base.

’ Pitt’s Maggie Sevilla quickly ﬁelds the ball
and takes, one, two, three steps to re-position
herselffor athrow to ﬁrst base. Ewing’s out.

Head coach Holly Aprile now has one of
her leaders back in the inﬁeld after Sevilla
missed nearly the entirety of the 2013 spring
season.

“It’s going to help us a lot just because
she’s one of our most outspoken, kind of
bold personalities on the inﬁeld,” Aprile said.
“She kind of creates a really good tone and
attitude in the inﬁeld, in particular, and with
the team.” '

It’s hard to believe that just seven months
ago ‘Sevilla was watching her team from the
sidelines due to an injury suffered when at-
tempting to ﬁeld a routine ground ball at sec-
ond against Western Michigan last season.

Already seven games into the 2013 sea-
son, the then-sophomore tore her medial
collateral ligament and medial patellofemo-

ral ligament, which_ connects the femur to
the knee.
The combination of these two injuries
‘forced Sevilla to make a crucial decision:
whether or not she should redshirt her
sophomore year.

“It took me weeks. I talked_to my parents
and coaches about [the decision],” Sevilla
said. “I felt that was best for the team.”

This decision was tough on Sevilla be-
cause she had to decide between losing ayear
of eligibility or preserving a year of play so

she could recover. Either way, Sevilla would
have found herselfoff the ﬁeld that she loved
so much and away from the team she became
so close with. ‘
Before her injury, Sevilla had a team-high
batting average of .476, which would not be
matched by any other player the rest of the
season. She was also named to the Aggie

' Classic All-Tournament Team, at which she

had a total of six hits, including two RBIs
and two doubles.

“No matter what sport, whenever you
have someone in the starting lineup and
this happens, that affects your statistical

' ‘outcomes. It affects you,” said head coach

Holly Aprile. ,
Viewing her teammates from the perspec-
tive of the sidelines gave the junior a new
appreciation for the game that she loves.
“Being hurt really gave me a new insight,
I saw [the game] from the coaches’ end and

I just appreciate everything so much more,”
said Sevilla.

Over the summer, as she began to recover
from her injuries, Sevilla participated in a
slow—pitch softball league to stay on top of
her game, as well as to help return her body
to game-ready form. A

“This summer, I just focused on getting
my ground balls back in, and I played a lot
of slow—pitch softball,” Sevilla said. “I didn’t
play fast-pitch because I didn’t want to hurt
my knee too much, so I just rehabbed and
weight-lifted and did everything I needed
to do to get back on the ﬁeld.” '

Moving into the spring season, Sevilla’s

batter’s box.

Panthers
head to Wake

Forest, look for

ﬁrst ACC 

Andrew Stern
Staﬁ“ Wrz'ter

Pitt women’s soccer continues its search
for the team’s ﬁrst conference win of the
season tonight against the No. 22 Wake
Forest Demon Deacons. This season, the
Panthers (4-11-1, 0-10-O ACC) have been
outscored by 25 goals in ACC play and have
failed to produce a single ACC point this
season in 10 matches (0-10). .

While Pitt has yet to win, captain Mor-
gan Sharick still holds faith in her team’s
capabilities to win before the season ends.

“We have three more opportunities to

get out there and earn another possible "

nine points,” Sharick said. “I still believe in
this team and don’t believe that we’re go-
ing to end the season without an ACC win.”

Although Sharick and the Panthers may
be conﬁdent, they face a difﬁcult oppo-
nent in Wake Forest (9-4-2, 4-4-2 ACC).
This season, the Demon Deacons have
scored 25 times, led by senior forward
Katie Stengel, who has tallied seven goals
and 20 total points this season.

If the Panthers want to put on a suc-
cessful performance and pick up their ﬁrst
conference victory of the season, the team
must ﬁnd a way past Wake Forest goalie
Aubrey Bledsoe. Bledsoe owns a goals-
against average of 0.75 and a conference-
leading .831 save percentage.

This season, Wake Forest has played
extremely well against a pair of top-ranked
teams in the ACC. .

On Sept. 12, the Demon Deacons tied

Week eight of the ACC season saw a deﬁnite

hierarchy established in the conference, by .
, way of now-No. 2 Florida State’s 51-14 demo-
lition of No. 9 Clemson Saturday night. As a ,

result, the Seminoles vaulted over Oregon

give the ACC a participant in the National
Championship if the season ended today.

1. No. 2 Florida State (6-o,'4-o ACC)

The Seminoles locked themselves into
the status of the conference’s bestnteam with
another fantastic performance from redshirt
freshman Jameis Winston. Winston com-
pleted 22 of 34 passes for a career-high 444
yards and added three touchdowns, while
his Clemson counterpart, Tajh Boyd, ﬁnished
17-for-37 with two interceptions against the
Seminoles defense.

Scheduling cupcakes in college
football must be discouraged

. goal, then everytlling else will work out. ’

Joseph Goodman
MCT Campus

The ﬁrst and most important goal for the
new College Football Playoff Selection

Committee should be ﬁguring out a way

to discourage major teams from scheduling
opponentsfrom lower divisions.

Let’s be clear: the College Football
Playoff Committee isn’t going to ﬁx what’s
wrong with the postseason. If you think
that’s the point of this whole charade, then
you also probably thought the government
shutdown was about making America bet-
ter. No, college football won’t realize its full
potential until there is a 16—team playoff,

but, until the contracts are torn_up and

renegotiated, this new 13—person panel can
still do some good for the sport. ’

V ‘ College football likes to tell us it has
the best regular season in sports, but that
simply can’t be the case when more tradi-
tional rivalries are dying every year and
nonconference dates are being ﬁlled in
with easy victories. Alabama has won two

. championships in a row and is the No. 1

team, yet one—sixth of its schedule is sim-
ply unwatchable. Where’s the fun in that?
Now obviously, collegeqfootball has a
loftier mission statement than simplytry—
ing to make it as competitive as possible.
Other things are also valued. For instance,
tailgate parties and one extra home game
a year for more tailgate_parties. But, as a
general rule, the sport, as a whole, does not
beneﬁt from Miami scheduling Savannah
State, no matter how much fun you had
tailgating before that 77-7 blowout.
That’s why this College Football Playoff
Committee has the potential to be so ben-
eﬁcial, and not just because of the guaran-
teed entertainment value of the committee
members being put on an island in the
Paciﬁc for the greatest season of Survivor
ever. Now taking bets on Tom Osborne
going all “Lord of the Flies.” .
But seriously, right now, at the adven
of the selection committee and the pro-
cess by which it is going to value teams, a
system needs to be created to award better
nonconference matchups. If the commit-
tee rigs the system to make that the No. 1

1

That’s right. The ‘system needs to be
rigged because, let’s be real, it’s not like

the BCS system wasn’t rigged in the ﬁrst.

place; There is nothing wrong with doc-
toring the numbers to help create a more
exciting regular season.

Understand that this committee isn’t
only about identifying the best four teams
for a playoff. To begin with, that’s not really
even possible at this point. The model that
will be implemented next season is simply,
as numbers gurujerry Palm of CBSSports.
com told me so brilliantly on the phone this
past week, “BCS on steroids.” And Palm is
right-. It’s not really a playoff at all.

But the sport eventually (hopefully be— W

fore I’m dead) will have a full—blown play-
off, and it’s important to get things right
in the meantime so that college football
can, truly, be the most exciting sport from
beginning to end in the country.

In other words, teams such as Florida
need to be encouraged to play teams such

‘ as Miami every season. Instead of Alabama

playing Chattanooga the second-to-last
week of the season, the Crimson Tide
should be playing Texas or UCLA. I don’t
think anyone is going to object to Oregon
opening the season with Auburn instead
of Nicholls State.

The committee said in a release that
“no one single metric will be identiﬁed as
paramount over all other data,” but maybe
that’s the wrong approach if it’s going to
encourage teams to continue to buy wins
by scheduling opponents from a lower

division. Again, the status quo is detracting ,

from the sport.

The committee will convene soon to
hammer out the metricsthat will be used
to rank teams. The system will be similar to
basketball’s RPI, but differences between
basketball and football make it important

to value speciﬁc metrics more than others. .

There are fewer games in football,
which means less data will be generated
for analysis. And that’s why a greater val-
ue needs to be placed on nonconference
strength of schedule than most other met-

Pitt has played a disappointing inau-
gural ACC season so far. The Panthers are
0-10 in conference play and have allowed

‘ more than three goals in six ACC games

this season.

The team is also struggling to score.
The Panthers have not scored a goal since
Sept. 22 in a 3-1 loss against then—No.
1 North Carolina. The scoreless streak
spans six matches. In fact, the Panthers
have scored only one goal in their last 10

matches. The most recent match was a
4-0 defeat to Virginia Tech last weekend.
_ Pitt faces Duke and Maryland to con-
clude the season, but head coach Greg
Miller stresses that the team will take
the ﬁnal matches one at a time to ﬁnish
strong. _

“We have to start with one win, and

then go from there,” Miller said. “We have .

to learn from previous mistakes and get

want to hit as much as I can,” Sevilla said.

Now that Sevilla has returned, junior
third—base player Carissa Throckmorton
enjoys having Sevilla’s aggressiveness back
in the inﬁeld.

“She pushes everyone-to go after every
ball, and if we make a mistake, she’s always
picking us up,” Throckmorton said. “It’s
good to have her personality on the team
and always pushing you.”

Sevilla was dynamic at the plate during
the Youngstown State Classic and com-
municated effectively on the ﬁeldlwith her
teammates, creating a familiar atmosphere
the Panthers were used to experiencing

before her injury.

“She really commands her position
well, and that helps to set a tone,” Aprile
said. “It’s not that the other girls don’t do
it as well, but she really knows her position
well.,She’s played it for a long time and just
commands it.” *

During the 2013 spring and fall seasons,
many changes were made to the team.
Positions were rearranged, new recruits
were added to the roster and the return-
ing starters gained experience after their
19-29 season. _

Despite the transitions made from sea-
son to season, Sevilla’s attitude remains
constant. 1

“I feel like I haven’t missed a beat,” ,

beamed Sevilla, “I’m just so excited to be
back.” I -

ultimately lost 24-14.

11. Syraéuse (3-4, 1-2 ACC)

With each week that passes, it becomes
clearer that the Orange just aren’t very good.
Syracuse was decimated by Georgia Tech’s
triple-option en route to a 56-0 loss, and the
team allows an average of 29 points per game.

12. North Carolina State (3-3, 0-3 ACC)

Of the three ACC teams without a confer-
ence win, the Wolfpack is the only team above
.500. N.C. State has lost three of its last four
games, though, and another loss is probably
in order, as the team faces Florida State next.

Virginia has lost four games in a row, a
streak that ﬁgures to stretch to ﬁve straight
losses against a Georgia Tech team fresh off
a 56-0 win oversyracuse. The battle for the
basement ensues in two weeks, when the
Cavaliers face North Carolina Nov. 9.

The Tar Heels have the least amount of
