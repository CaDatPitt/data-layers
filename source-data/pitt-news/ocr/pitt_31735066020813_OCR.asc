Students complain about dormitory conditions

By Colleen Denne
Staff Writer

Pitt students can pay in excess
of $900 per semester to live in
the residence halls; however,
many of these people are com-
plaining about the unclean con-
ditions of their bathrooms,

"hallways, stairwells and ele-

vators.

Donovan Hughes, director of
Housing and Food Services, was
unavailable for comment, but
several dormitory residents stat-
ed their complaints about the sit-
uation.

Fred Zummo, a sophomore in
the School of Engineering, who
lives in Tower B, said, ”The big-
gest [problem] I see is the
bathroom. They should have
someone came up on Saturday or

Sunday to clean the bathrooms.”

Kristin Steier, a freshman CAS
student who lives in Tower B,
said, ”The bathrooms are always
a mess on the weekends because
nobody cares to clean up after
themselves. It's not fair to the rest
of us.”

Gil Schaeffer, assistant
manager of dormitory support
services (housekeeping) ex-
plained that in fact, there is a
weekend crew on duty. ”If some-
thing happens on the weekend,
the weekend person cleans it. If
the problem persists, there is an
emergency number where we
can be reached,” said Schaeffer.

”When you walk into the
bathroom [on the weekends] you
can smell the fungus in the show-
er. To use the sink by Sunday,
you have to pick from two clean

sinks. The toilets are the worst. If '

one isn't broken, there are just no
clean ones," said Mike Yurich, a
sophomore Tower C resident.
Zummo also -feels there is a
problem with dirty hallways. He
said, ”Last Saturday, on one of
the floors, there was ketchup on
the walls and ”O” cheese on the
carpet, which was also torn. It

'was a mess.”

Freida DeLisi, a housekeeper at
the university, said, ’’It bothers
me that boys don't flush toilets,
girls leave [feminine hygiene
products] in the bathroom, peo-
ple trashing the halls; breaking
things like light bulbs and bottles.
[Items] people can be cut on.”

There are also complaints that
the stairwells are unclean. Zum-
mo said, ”The second biggest
thing is that the stairwell is almost

never mapped. There are always
smashed beer cans. You name it,
it is in the stairwell. I've even
seen puke. That happens, but
they can at least clean it up."

The last major gripe that stu-
dents have is that the elevators
are not being cleaned. Steier said,
”The elevators are just as bad as
the bathrooms.”

Schaeffer claimed that most stu-
dents seem to ”leave things”
where they are. He said that a
majority of the students are tak-
ing better care of the dorms since
renovations began. ”Some peo-
ple get out of hand.”

”They’re no different than my
son at home in a lot of cases. At
different times, [for example] af-
ter exams, maybe they party
more. It hasn't been too bad
here,” Schaeffer added.

Improved bus and shuttle services examined

By Sandra Kramer
Staff Writer

Both the campus bus and cam-
pus shuttle have proved to be

'.necessary means of transporta-

tion for Pitt students, and the Stu-
dent Government Board is
working to improve these
services.

Board member Harper Watters
is heading a project to better the
campus bus service, while board
member Sandra Woods is trying
to resolve the difficulties with the
campus shuttle.

. Both the campus bus and shut-

tle run on specific schedules
throughout the day and night.
Woods stated, ”There have

been reported problems with the

shuttle. Inconveniences have oc-
curred because of problems with
the time and place of the shuttle.
”I've received complaints that
it's not always there when it's
supposed to be." she added.

A letter was issued by Woods
to Pitt shuttle students. It asked
those having problems with the
shuttle to write a letter to Woods
pertaining to the time and loca-
tion of the problem experienced.

She continued: ”Presently, I am
waiting for respones to the letter
I sent out. Then, I hope to work
out a new route [with both] the
shuttle service and students. I'd

like it so  everyone is happy.”

Watters commented, ”Right
now, I am trying to work out the
logistics for new routes for the
campus bus. I'm looking for a
feasible plan. I want to spend a
reasonable amount of money to
serve the students well.”

According to Watters, ”People
have generally been pleased with
the campus bus. However, for
safety reasons, and to benefit the
students living in North Oakland,
I am working to extend the
route.”

A list of students living in North
Oakland was compiled to get an

idea of the number of students
who could benefit from the ex-
tension.

”The existing route only goes
up to Bellefield. But because of
the fraternities and other students
living on streets like Dithridge, I'd
like to see the bus go all the way
down to Nevel Street.” said
Watters. . ‘

He added, ”I think this would
be beneficial and safer for these
students.

”Presently, I am waiting for the
list of student names from North
Oakland. The project is  in its
beginning stages right now."

Zummo said, ”Overall, the
dorms have improved since last
year. It's the little things — the
bathroom, the stairwells — but
they should make an attempt to
clean it up."

”It’s not that people are pur-
posely doing it, it's just a normal
mess that accumulates. If every-
one happens to drop something
or spill something, with 30 peo-
ple, it gets messy,” Yurich said.

’’If you have guests on the
weekend, they're appalled. All
[housekeepers] do is empty the
garbage. It reflects on the whole
campus.”

Schaeffer said, ”This school is
no different than any other.  If
everything was perfect, there
would be no need for [cus-
todians]/’

Students
attend  
broadcast

By Mike Hudson
Staff Writer

Students from Pitt's English
department talked with national
talk show hosts from CBS’s This
Morning television program to
discuss journalism and getting
started in media broadcasting.

The question—and-answer ses-
sion with Kathleen Sullivan and
Harry Smith, which was taped on
Pittsburgh 2 Day, will be aired on
Friday afternoon's show.

The audience consisted of stu-
dents from area colleges who
were invited to attend Wednes-
day's taping.

After participating in a live
broadcast, the collegiate jour-
nalists hooked up with Sullivan
and Smith via satellite to hear
their opinions on getting started
in journalism and broadcasting
careers.

Sullivan advised students not to
concentrate their focus on just
journalism. She said they would
be better off studying a subject
that would give them a field of
expertise instead.

Smith told students to get ex-
perience in other areas before
coming to the networks in hopes
of landing a job. He also urged
students to do as much reading
as they can, in an effort to edu-
cate themselves.

Both talk show hosts agreed
that hard work and talent will
only get you so far; getting ex-
perience and paying your dues is
what it takes to make it in the big
time.

YEREVAN, U.S.S.R. (AP) —
Authorities eased a curfew here
Wednesday, but ethnic tensions
remain high in this republic that
was the site of mass demonstra-

tions before being hit by a

devastating earthquake in De-
cember.

The military commander in
Yerevan, in an announcement
published in the daily newspaper
Kommunist, said the midnight-
to-6 a.m. curfew would be
reduced further to 1 a.m. to 5
a.m.

The decision was made ”con—
sidering the stabilization of the
situation in the capital and
regions of the republic during the
past month, the participation of
citizens in supporting public ord-
er and requests of residents,” the
newspaper said.

A government commission
called for speeding up construc-
tion to clear the debris and build
new housing in northwestern
regions of the republic stricken by
the Dec. 7 earthquake, which
killed an estimated 25,000 peo-
ple and left a half million
homeless. The commission com-

plained the organizations in-
volved in reconstruction are
bickering among themselves and
making little progress.

Also on Wednesday, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson visited Armenian
leaders in a tour he said would
help him determine what further
aid can be provided.

Marine found guilty
in death of soldier

CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) —
A military judge on Wednesday
convicted a Marine platoon ser-
geant of negligence in the death
of a soldier who had been left be-
hind in the Mojave Desert during
a training exercise in August.

The judge, Maj. Kent Smith,
ruled that Sgt. Christopher Clyde
failed to properly account for the
whereabouts and welfare of his
Marines.

Clyde was the platoon sergeant
of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, 19, of
Minneapolis, Minn., who was left
behind during a night exercise
Aug. 30 after being posted as a

NEWS BRIEFS

road guide in the California
desert. His remains were found in
December.

The sergeant was found inno-
cent of willful disobedience. He
had been accused of failing to
obey orders in granting leave to
Rother’s squad leader after the ex-
ercise, resulting in a delay in
realizing Rother had been left
behind.

Clyde has maintained he did
nothing wrong and that he only
relied on the instructions of his
superiors. ’’If he's guilty of any-
thing, he’s guilty of relying on
other people,” defense attorney
William Fisher said in closing ar-
guments.

Prosecutor Robert Nunally had
argued, ”He screwed up and he
screwed up in a ,major way.”

On Tuesday, the defense and
prosecution reached an agree-
ment that eliminated the need for
Sgt. Thomas B. Turnell, Rother’s
squad leader, to testify. Turnell
also faces a court-martial ‘in the
case.

EPA proposes ban of ‘

Alar apple pesticide

WASHINGTON (AP) —- The
Environmental Protection Agen-
cy proposed yesterday the ban-
ning of a pesticide which
regulates apple growth and in-
creases shelf life because of a link
to cancer.

The EPA, however, stopped
short of ordering the chemical,
which is marketed under the
trade name Alar, immediately off
the market because it said it does
not consider the health risk se-
vere enough for such action.

Traveler encounters anti—A,mericanism in Switzerland

’’So you've come to Europe to
become polished and sophisticat-
ed?” Phillipe asked in heavily ac-
cented English.

Polished? Sophisticated? As we
pulled up to a stoplight in down-
town Geneva, Switzerland, I con-
templated strangling him.

”You’re joking, right?” I asked
with a small, insincere laugh.

MICHELE
QUINN

”Oh no, no. I thought all
Americans wanted to come here
to learn about cultural sophistica-
tion,” he replied seriously.

I stared at the tassle hanging
from his rearview mirror and
wondered if it was strong enough

to be used as a murder weapon.

Jean Marc, a friend I was visit-
ing in Geneva, had told me that
his friend Phillipe was a ”charac-
ter,” but I thought he would just
be a bit eccentric. /

Jean Marc didn't tell me Phil-
lipe hated Americans.

He didn't really hate them, he
just disliked the type of Ameri-
cans he saw in Geneva.

Later that evening, New Year's
Eve, we went to the Pickwick
Club, a favorite hangout for
Americans.

I watched Phillipe and his girl-
friend, Isabelle, stare at a U.S.
Marine in'the corner trying to
pick up a woman, as two Ameri-
can girls ran around the bar pop-
ping decorative balloons with
colorful umbrellas from their
drinks.

Phillipe and Isabelle were
university students who had lived
in Geneva for most of their lives.
They had traveled to the Nether-
lands, the Soviet Union and
Africa.

”We don't really want to go to
the United States,” he stated dur-
ing a conversation about travel-
ing. Isabelle, who could only
understand some English, shook
her head, smiling.

Not visit the U.S.A.? I realized,
subconsciously, I thought every-
one wantedto go to the good ol’
U.S. —— the land of the free and
the brave, the land of oppor-
tunity. .

In anger, I sat silently watching
two marines arguing over who
won a beer-chugging contest.
The U.S. Marine was now mak-
ing out with the woman in the

”ls this place always like this?"
I asked Jean Marc.

”Oh yeah. This is known as the
English pub where Americans
hang out in Switzerland,” he re-
plied, smiling.

I then discovered that my new
friends hardly ever visited the bar.

”We thought you would want
to be around Americans on New
Year's Eve,” Jean Marc said.

As I watched the, people in the
bar laughing, screaming and try-
ing to pretend they were in a bar
in America, I realized why Phil-
lipe would question Americans’
cultural sophistication.

I quickly explained I did not

want to imitate New Year's Eve
in the United States, and I would
rather celebrate it Swiss—style.

We immediately left the bar
and Isabelle’s smile brightened as
we pulled up in front of her apart-
ment complex.

She jumped out of the car, ran .

into the building and appeared a
few minutes later, out of breath,
carrying two bottles of cham-
pagne and a box of Swiss
chocolates.

We returned to Jean Marc's
apartment where we snacked on
chocolate, pretzels and cham-
pagne for five hours.

Is$60,000 too much

If you've ever wondered what politicians and college .

° for part—time work?   TV

administrators have in common, you need not wonder any

longer.
Money.

6 Neither species seems to know how to use it correctly,

and neither ever thinks they have enough. Take newly ac-
quired, part—time Pitt professor (and former Pa. House
speaker) K. Leroy Irvis. After three decades of public office,
Irvis has earned a pension of $72,790 a year. The ques-
tion is, does he really deserve $60,000 more a year to
teach one course once a term at Pitt? ~ ‘

Full-time professors, mind you, only averaged $54,200
last year, and they were here every day.

Irvis, be_ing_the politician he is, probably thought he

 came upwith a pretty good tactic to avoid criticism of . --
" ' his salary. He said that he didn't want any state funds con-

tributing to his paycheck because he was already getting
enough public money in his pension. .
That’_s nice of him, but did anyone think about the

source of this $60,000? Word has it that our tuition is about _

to go up...
In a nutshell...

3 ”All I can tell you is whoever did that briefing did

a very good job — a hell of a job.”

— David Beckwith, Quayle’s press secretary, com-
menting on a briefing given to reporters b". the vice
president, after Quayle gave instructions not to have
his name associated with the briefing.

Working sixdays a week keeps

According to Mr. David Sanger
of The New York Times, the
Japanese are having a very

S 0' difficult time persuading their

workers to put in a five-day week.

ART
BUCHWALD

For years, everyone was content
to work six days, so trying to ad-
just to five has not been easy.
This campaign for a reduction
in hours is meant to encourage

Gmore leisure time, as well as al-

low the worker to spend a lot
more yen in the homeland. Ja-
panese institutions, from the
banks to the unions, are trying to
force a radical change of lifestyle,
and there has been great
resistance to the proposal. Ac-
cording to Sanger, 30 percent of
the Japanese people are in favor
of a five-day work week, and 70

 percent are against it.

Using leisure time to its utmost
.lS one area where Americans ex-

cel over the Japanese. In fact, we
spend twice as .much time being
laid back (figuratively speaking)
as our tradingpartners across the
seas.

Therefore, the Japanese are hir-
ing American firms to convince
workers in Japan that a 40-hour
week is better than a .48-hour
one, no matter what their bosses
tell them.

One U.S. consulting firm,
called TGIFIJ (Thank God It's Fri-
day In Japan), is run by Lawrence
Bathgate II, and his company has
landed a major contract with the
Japanese.

Lawrence told me, ”This is the
toughest job I've ever had. Every
time I try to get the Japanese to
relax, they jumpand start weld-
ing another bumper onto a car
while singing the Toyota fight
song.”

”How do you know where to
start?” I asked.

”I’ve been sending over‘ stu-
dents from the United States to
teach them a thing or two. If any-

Someone once asked me why
I‘ wanted to write. for a
newspaper. This person, a com-
munications major here at Pitt,
wants to produce television

' news.

She feels that television is a
much more exciting medium

than any form of the print media,

LOU GRIECO .

and thinks that anyone who
would want to write for a news-
paper ‘is demented.

Of course, this is the‘-'geniu,s~

who didn’t believe me when I
told her that abortion was illegal
in most states before 1973, and
that Roe vs. Wade could be over-
turned this year.

Personally, I have never even
considered working for a televi-
sion station. It has never once

crossed my mind.

Part of this obviously "must
come from the fact that I really
enjoy reading. This includes
books, magazines andyes, news-
papers. This was my motivation
to work in the print media.

Another reason must be my
dislike of television. I rarely
watch TV, even the news, and I

one knows how to take life easy, _

it's the American youngster.”

”What approach do the stu-

dents take?” ‘
”As soon as they set foot on
Japanese soil, they go to the

beach. Our goal is to persuade.

the people ofJapan that they can
get as much pleasure from sun-
tanning as they can from screw-
ing the back onto a Sony
Walkman. American kids are
great when it comes to teaching
others how not to lift a finger.”

”How do you convince the

Japanese that a five-day week is

better than a six-day one?”

”We have advised the govern-
ment that it cannot do it unless it
builds more golf courses. People
can't be expected to take the
weekend off if they have no golf
courses to play on.”

’’I hope that they have respond-
ed positively.” ,

”Yes, they're building golf
courses as fast as they can. The
trouble is that while they're wait-
ing to tee off, .the workers keep

from behin

detest. talk shows. I haven't
watched TV regularly since I was
10 years old. It just doesn't" cap-
ture my attention.

For example, I was part of the
studio audience yesterday, for
Pittsburgh 2 Day, a local talk
show.

The audience was comprised
of students from different colleges
who were interested in pursuing
careers in the media, especially
television. Though the show was
aired live yesterday, another seg-
ment was taped to be run tomor-

row. Look for me. I’m"the guy‘

yawning.

The taped segment was kind of
interesting, with students talking
to national television personali-
ties via satellite about working in
television. But it was too late. I
had just sat through the live
show, and the lack of excitement
wiped ‘me out-. '

The first part of the show had
Robin Cook, the author of Coma,
pushing his new book, Mutation,
about genetic engineering. There
was a local expert in the field
there too, and they discussed
ethical problems in medicine.

A very interesting and impor-
tant topic. But they only

men out of the housel

heading for the factories because
they want to build just one more
microwave oven.” ,

”Is there anything you can do
about that?” I asked Bathgate.

”My people are only‘ attempt-
ing to teach the virtues of leisure.
We try to impress upon the Ja-
panese that it is more productive
to go to a department store than
it is to produce a hand-held type-
writer which also doubles as a fax
machine. Our message is that the
only road to true bliss for the
Japanese workers is to acquire as
many material goods as their
houses will hold. We also tell
them that there is more happiness
to be found on the ski slopes of
Mount Fuji than in _all the
skyscrapers in Osaka.”

”Are they buying
message?"

”Not too well. The male work-
ers are very worried that if you
cut them down from a six-day
week to a five-day one, it will
mean spending two days at home

scratched the surface. By the time
they were done with introduc-

tions, there were only afew_

minutes left to talk about the

topic before the commercial

break. If I ever tried to write a sto-
ry with so little information, my

editor would scrap it im-

mediately.

Another author was featured‘

later in the show, a pseudo—hip

playboy whose book is about ' I I:

“men who are too cool to get
married.” Now there's ex-
citement. '

The only moderateIy.interest-

prerecorded interview with
comedian Martin Short.

Though the show was dull, we  
all clapped. The people who .
worked in the studio were kind I

enough to tell us when, and for
how long. ‘ ‘

India's Salaam Bombay! col-
lected prizes at the Cannes and

' Montreal film festivals this year

and won worldwide acclaim. The
film is an odyssey through the
Bombay slumland, showing the
lives of street people with relent-
less, often horrifying realismd

It's not everyday that a film tries
to tackle issues such as city life,
let alone the life of poor people.
That's what makes Salaam Bom-
bay! unique. lt’s like an abbreviat-
ed‘ Dickens tragedy with a
distinctly Indian flavor.

We're given the city through
the beggar’s-eye view of the boy
Krishna (Shafiq Syed). Krishna
roams the streets, serving tea and

to save 500 rupees and return to

dren as well as his friend, a

Director Mira Nair has "gath-
ered a talented cast, combining
professional actorswith real
Bombay street people. A web of
complications involve a cruel,
would-be media darling pimp,

who looks after an aging prosti- -

tute, and their daughter and an in-
nocent girl who has recently
been sold to the brothel.

The brilliant photography cre-
ates a vivid panorama, juxtapos-
ing movie star billboards and
cultural icons with the sordid
street scene. The story leaps from

~With genius comes power, as
demonstrated by Friedrich Dur-
renmatt’s dark comedy, The
Physicists, which is currently run-
ning at Stephen Foster Memorial
Theater.

The play examines scientific
advancement and its potential to
destroy humanity. Three mad
physicists, who are patients at a
Sanitarium, ponder the issue after
each of them kills a nurse.

The first of our mad physicists,
Mobius (played by Michael
Dowd), claims that King Solomon
reveals the secrets of science to
him. He strangles a nurse, Moni-
ka (Sara Fleming), who is in love

- with him. She doesn't believe

that he's insane and makes ar-
rangements to take him away

comes muddled.

When deciding to make the
film, Nair went out into the
streets and used the real child
beggars of Bombay. She says,
”For them, the epitome of ’acting’
was an Indian film star cavorting
around trees singing a song, or

‘loudly declaiming his honor, or

protecting his woman from evil.
I always knew that Salaam Bom-

bay! was to be a total departure

from this formula...”
And Salaam Bombay! is
definitely a departure from 99
percent of the movies outrthere.
It is the work of talented creators,
but be forewarned: they don't get
giuch more downbeat than this.
There should be a warning before
the opening credits: ”Abandon
hope all ye who enter here.”
I tried to remember the last
time I'd seen something this grim:

maybe a Dostoevsky novel or a‘

particularly manic episode of Hill
Street Blues. Every tragic exis-
tence goes from bad to worse.
There's no hope for Krishna or

ny of the characters in this film.
Salaam Bombay! is reminiscent
of a Dickens tragedy, but it makes
most Dickens tragedies seem
about as distraught as The Cosby
Show. -

Salaam Bombay! tries to getat
the heart of a heartless city. It's
strong stuff and won't be soon
forgotten.

from the asylum. But Mobius is
afraid of unleashing his physics
discoveries on the world. That's
why he's hiding in the institution,
posing as a madman, and that is
why he kills her.

The other mad physicists are Er-
nesti (Mark Albi) and Beutler
(Gregory Durham). Ernesti thinks
he's Albert Einstein and Beutler
believes himself to belsaac New-
ton — but not really. Both are
spying on Mobius for the intelli-
gence agencies of their respective
governments.

So, they are physicists, but they
aren’t actually mad. Well, that
depends on how you look at it.
Mobius tries to convince them
that they are insane for chaining
themselves to scientific advance-
ment — which will only destroy
civilization in the end, anyway.

Ernesti and Beutler each kill a

nurse who seems to be ”getting
wise” to their true identities. The
Physicists has a lot in common
with a bizarre spy novel — the
plot perpetually twisting, turning
and coming full circle.

Other than insanity and three
dead nurses, we have Dr. von
Zahnd (Camille Hallstrom), who
seems just a little odd, at first,
then turns into Nurse Ratchet

ASHLEY

HAIGHT

(One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest). Dr. von Zahnd, who be-
lieves herself to be the only sane
person in the place, is the play’s
greatest lunatic.

Police Inspector Voss (Kenneth
Roberts) is called to the scene to
investigate the ”accidents” in-
volving the nurses. He walks
away from the scene believing
(incorrectly) that the physiscists
are absolutely mad and that

justice is best served allowing
them to remain in the sanitarium.

The Physicists was directed by
Peter Harrigan. The direction was
this production’s best feature and
included some amusing syn-
chronized movement.

The set design was interesting  
and worked well for the produc- 
tion. A platform ran around the

girls, man," he said. “You don’t
treat girls like that, or anyone, for
that matter.”

The incident obviously had
Kevin fired up. ”Hitting girls is
really uncool,” he said. ’’It real-
ly bothers me when I see things
like that.”

7 Seconds has worked for
many years to keep themselves
out of the traditional hardcore
role. ”We’ve based ourselves for
the last nine years on something
that was more than just trash, des-
troy, burn it down and blow it
up,” says Kevin. ”We’re all for
healthy aggression and healthy
activity.” .

”You have to look at it beyond
your own fun,” says Kevin. ”If
you come in and beat people up,

sure, you may be having-fun, but .

there's a whole slew of people
that aren't.

”We don’t travel hundreds of
miles to come play to watch peo-

cause it's my own feeling. There’s_ .

no pressure on [the otherband
members] not to, as long as they
keep their life together for the

.band/’

The band has received some
friction over their change‘ of mu-
sical style. Many fans holler that
they want the ”old” 7 Seconds,-
a band that can't be replicated in
Kevin's mind. '

”It just came into place,” says
Kevin. ”We started working on

more midtempo stuff. Whatever I

influences were there came into
play. I don’t think that we, made
a conscious effort to sit down and '
say, ’Let’s not be hardcore,‘ let's
be new wave.’ We never did
that.”

Many followers have simply
accepted the change.”__For every
person that has given up on 7 Se-
conds, there are a dozen new and

‘old fans who respect themifor
_ their honesty and musical en-

deavors.

As an epilogue to the show,
Kevin lets the audience know ex-
actly what the band stands for.“

”We play music for black people _
- and white --people, for yellow."

people and purple people. We

play for skinheads, for people '

with long hair and for people
-with short hair. We play for fat

people and skinny people, for tall '

people and short people. We
play for homosexuals and heter-
osexuals alike.".

Thelbest part about the entire ’ I

speech is that 7 Seconds stands 0

-‘behind it.: '- '. . . ‘ .   

 
  

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 2, T989

You’ve seen them at concerts,
parties and nightclubs. They're
making a statement, trying to look
thin, attempting to be seductive,
or on their way to blow up a Nazi
Germany ammunition depot.
Who are they? Worshipers of the
all—black wardrobe.

We took to the pavement in
search of a reason and an under-
standing of a person who wears
black as a main ingredient in their
dress. Before riding off in the
”Tom Hooper Celebrity,” we fo-
cused our attention on the
wardrobes of our own.

And what did our wandering
eyes discover? Black shoes, black
dresses, black sweaters, black
pants, black knickers, black rid-
ing boots and many black items
we do not have room to mention.

. We have come to the conclusion

that black is definitely us.

Betty likes black for the slim-
ming effect, the way it contrasts
her light hair color; and her
favorite‘ designer, Valentio, de-
signs mainly in black. Wilma, on
the other hand, prefers black for
the artistic way it lends itself to
her style, the seductive feeling it
creates and the classy look it adds

ing black: ’’I always wear black,
I'm in constant mourning.” Del-
ana is a graduate of Pitt, now pur-
suing a career in culinary
etiquette and receding hair-line
therapy (l—80.0-I-AM—BALD).

After a bit of British cheer, we
hiked up the steps of Graffiti to
the real residence of the black-
clothed society. Armed with tape
recorder and camera, we took on
the challenging crowd of the Toll
and the 11th Hour.

BETTY

&
WILMA

Our first victim was Paul Peter-
son, who wears black because
”it’s a representation of rock 'n’
roll, and rock’n’ roll is evil.”
Graffiti employee, Jenny Cala-
brese, commented that ”there’s a
certain feeling to it; it's what I'm
comfortable in.”

For more intimate discussion,

we ventured through the door to
the ladies’ room, where we dis—
covered that ”it’s easy to match,”
according to Kathy Lorent. lt’s

-S0C4Hl{e“WlNg

A
New
Column

amazing how many people told
us that they wear black because
‘it matches everything, and yet
they didn't match it to any color
except black. Contradictions at
Graffiti.

Maureen was wearing black
because ”They were the only
pants I had clean.” Debbie Walk-
er, manager at Kards Unlimited,
is very positive and thinks that
’’Black is beautiful, and I wear
black because I like the way it
looks on me. I feel thinner.”

We departed the ladies room
and aimed our tape recorder
toward the sounds of the 11th
Hour. Next Big Thing Produc-

tions employee, Dana Resciniti,
is of the opinion that wearing

black to concerts makes people -

”feel a part of the group.” Fellow
employee, Renae Gudukas,
agrees and further elaborated that
”black is a trend. It has a lot to
do with the performers wearing
it. It's fashion, and it's a form of
rebellion.” '

After we worked our way into
the dimly lit room, we were
graced with a comment by Pan-
ther Rowing Club President, Jim
Moratis: "It's all a new—wave
thing, everyone wants to be a part
of it. I love the music, but I'm not
a slave to fashion.” You heard it
here first; Jim Moratis is not a
slave to fashion.

Our award for the most crea-
tive meaning behind dressing in
black goes to Kirk Botula, owner
of the famous black dress socks,
too sacred to wear and not as at-
tractive to women as his argyles.

Militant musician Botula feels

’’’people wear black clothing so

that people can't spot them when
they're on terrorist raids‘. Say I
wanted to blow up a bridge or

. ammunition depot in Nazi Ger-

many. I would wear black and
put black on my face, and if l

sons on dressing for terrorists,
Kirk is the one to see.

All in all, our evening was

eventful. For all those we chased

into the bathroom in search of an ’
opinion, we apologize and we f

hope you understood the urgen-
cy of our mission. We had a great
time, except we were dying to in-

roof of the Sigma Chi house with

an overabundance of Pitt’

Lacrosse sweatshirts. We know

Than Friends.” This exceptional-
ly talented, strikingly handsome
guitar player-singer—songwriter
will take you by surprise.
Lending to the expected sell-
out performance are Najee and
Angela Bofill. Najee has quite an
impressive past. While living in
Queens, his neighborhood con-
sisted of such greats as Cameo,
Run—DMC and The System who
were then virtually unknown.
Najee has played with some of
the record industry's most suc-
cessful artists, such as Chaka
Khan and Me’lisa Morgan, and
was the opening act for Freddie
Jackson for nearly six months. His

debut album, Na/'ee’s -Theme
earned him a Grammy nomina-
tion for Best R&B Instrumental
Performance and has gone gold.

The forever-enticing Angela
Bofill continues her tradition of
warm, romantic music. Her
3‘/2—octave range is electrifying
and has led her to such success-
es as her membership in New
York's All-City Chorus, adegree
in voice from the Manhattan
School of Music and eight bone-
chilling albums. Bofill’s current
album, Intuition, reflects her
jazzy, soft, yet hair—raising style
and includes a duet with the ever-
soulful Peabo Bryson.

Lady Panther Tabatha long goes up for a rabound against ‘Villanova in action last night.

By Mike Ram.pa'
Staff Writer

_ There has beenplenty of
speculation this winter about
why the Pitt basketball team
wins games it's supposed to
_ lose (Florida, Syracuse, Okla-
homa, Seton Hall), and loses
games it's expected‘ to win
(Duquesne, Siena, Boston
College). I
Theories have been pro-
' posed, frustration publicly ex-
pressed by both the fans and
Coach Paul Evans, but still, no
one can explain the strange
course the Pitt hoop team has
-taken.

Pitt is a young team; it starts
with all sophomores on the
floor. It is also a team in tran-
sition, and Pitt is capable of
virtually anything. This in-
cludes beating the top teams
in the country and losing to
unranked teams.

Occasionally, Pitt seems to

play the role of a spoiler by
knocking highly ranked teams

“Especially in the Big East -

Indeed, the Big East is as

ference is stocked "with highly
talented guards who rack up
astronomical amounts of
points. Take Boston College
guard Dana Barros, who post-
ed up 43 at Fitzgerald Field
House earlier this season.

Since the top 20 teams in
the country always seem to
play the games that ”matter,”
a team like Pitt that scores up-
sets over the top 20 tends to
be lookedat in the wrong
way.

More attention is focused on
Syracuse having an off-night
than on Pitt having a good

This weekend, the men's swim-
ming team travels to Ohio State
to battle the Buckeyes in their last
dual meet of the year.

Men's swimming coach Dick
Bradshaw expects a close meet
with diving as the key.

”Ohio State is known as hav-

ing the best divers in the United"

States throughout history. I've lost
to them twice before by one
point,'and both times their divers

'3 took 1-2-3. Our swimmers have

always beaten theirs, but when it
came to the diving, we got beat,”
Bradshaw said.

”This year, we have some
talented divers, and if we can get
at least a second place, I think our
swimmers will do what they need
to do and we can win.” _

This past weekend, the Pan-
thers smashed Villanova,

143-100, to raise their dual meet.

record to 7-2.

Bradshaw was so convincedby
the victory that he no longer con-
siders the Wildcats, or any other
team, a threat to Pitt in the Big
East Championships, even if Pitt
does not shave or rest people to
decrease their times.

”Since we handled Villanova
the way we did,I do not believe
we're going to shave people for

’Nova sneaks by Lady
Panthers 61-58, despite

Johnson's big scoring: 

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

Pitt's women's basketball team
gave one of the elite teams in the
Big East Conference, Villanova, a
scare before bowing in a 61-58
nailbiter at -Fitzgerald ‘Field House
last night. '

The»Lady Panthers hung on till
the end with the taller Wildcats,
trailing by only twolat halftime
and grabbing a three-point lead
midway through the second half.
But in the end, failure to convert
plays during important times in
the game caused the hosts to
drop to 10-10 overall and 3-7 in
the Big East.

”We played hard and that's
good,” a dejected Bruce said af-
ter the contest/’But we had a lot
of people in there who played a
lot of minutes and didn't contrib-
ute very much at all offensively.
We just can't have that and ex-

-pect to win.”

Indeed, the only Pitt player to
hit double-digit scoring was for-
ward Lorri Johnson, who led both
squads with 31 points on 13 of
24shooting from the field and 4
for 5 free throw conversions.

One of the chief enigmas of the
loss had to be the fact that the
Lady Panthers, whose chief
problem to date this season has
been rebounding, actually out-
bounded ViIlanova_ by two
(40-38) when the final tallies
came out.

Bruce, however, was not quite

”Villanova was probably the only
threat to us as a team. I've been
getting times from the other
schools, and they don't look to

threaten us at all. I think we're"

strong enough that we can win it
without shaving.” -

II

This year 'we ‘have
some talented di.vers,
and if we can get at
least asecond place, I
think our swimmers
will do what they need
to do and we can win.

-— Dick Bradshaw

Pitt captured first place in eight
of the 13 events on Saturday and

The Lady Panthers’ set the tem-  I

them within striking range for the

The contest was tied at seven

’’I’m going to give Villanova

manner in which Villanova car-
ried themselves. They showed
poise and that's what you need

After winning their first two
meets of the season, Pitt's
men's gymnastics team will
face their toughest competi-
tion of the year Saturday at
1:30 p.m. at Trees Hall.

The Panthers, currently 5-O,

Ohio State.

’’I have to be realistic,” said
head coach Frank D’Amico.
”We’re not going to win

Men's gymnastics team looking
fo ward to facing tough Buckeyes ‘

against Ohio State, but we can
improve and still break some
records.”

Even though the Panthers
won last week's Shenandoah
Tournament, D’Amico feels
their overall score of 252.75
could have been better.

”As a team, we didn't per-
form as well as we could
have,” D’Amico said. ”We
had .\too’ many breaks and
major mistakes.”

D’Amico is planning on cor-

recting this problem.

’’I’m going to change the
lineup again this weekend,”
said D’Amico. ’’I’m not satis-
fied with the combination or
order of the athletes.”

This weekend's meet kicks
off a series of tough matchups.

’’I like this year's schedule,”
said D’Amico. ”February
looks difficult, and March will Q
be a bear — but it will be fun.
I'm really looking forward to
it.

NFL’s new free agency needs work   Swim——-

Introducing the premiere of
Bob and Doug McKenzie’s Great
White World of Sports.

”Hey, where's that bottle ope...
Are we on yet?"

”Shhhhhh, yes, hosehead. The
camera's ro|ling.”

”Oh, sorry, eh. Hosehead back
to you, too.”

Cooo, loo coo coo coo coo
coo cooooo... Cooo, loo coo coo
coo coo coo cooooo...

”OK, g’day. I'm Bob McKen-
zie, and this is my brother
Doug.”

”G’day, eh?”

”And welcome to our brand-
new show called Bob and Doug
McKenzie’s Great White World
of Sports. OK, so many of you out
there are asking, like, why are
these guys, like, interested in
sports all of a sudden? Well our
answer to that is ’Take off!’ What
do you think we are, wimps or
something? Like, we've been into
sports since we were just kids,
OK?”

”Yeah, like tobogganing and
beer tosses and stuff like that.”

”Right — especially the beer
tosses. Remember that time you
bopped Yukon Willie in the nose
with that cold one and he chased
you all the way down to the
7—E|even?”

”Yeah, great nachos, eh?”

”What do you mean, great
nachos?”

”I mean. I bought ol’ Yukon

breath a round of those nachos,

and, like, he forgot about the Bud
bottle on the brain in, like, sec-
onds. I never liked the hoser that
much to begin with, but I always

knew he could be bought. Smart
thinkin' on my part, eh?”

”Yeah, beauty. OK, so like our
first topic for the Great White
World of Sports is free agents.”

”Free agents, OK. Get it right.
Not secret agents. Or cleaning
agents. Or even strange agents,
like hosehead here.”

”Oh, take off.”

”No, you take off. Mom always
said, ‘Bob is the weird one of the
litter!’ "

”She did not!”

”Did so!”

THOMAS
DANYLUK

”OK [belch], believe what you
want, but I know. Now, let's get
this thing going. We've got to
beat Sajak in the ratings."

”OK, so the National Football
League, you know the Packers
and Broncos and those guys...”

”My favorite is the 49ers, eh?”

”Yeah, right. That's cause
you're on the bandwagon since
they won the Super Bowl. No,
Doug here is in the front seat driv-
ing the bandwagon.”

”That’s not truel! I've liked the
49ers since they won the last Su-
per Bowl!”

”Yeah, right. OK, anyway, the

National Football League has‘

decided that it is going to allow
free agents to play.”

”Yeah, like before, all the
agents were, like, tied up with
rope and chains and stuff and had
to do all kind of weird things with

PRESENTS

animals before games and stuf .”

”Rea|ly?”

”Wel|, yeah, hoser. But, like,
their owners changed their minds
the other day. Didn't you, like,
research that before we came out
here today?”

”Yeah, but I didn't think it was
that bad.”

”Wel|, it is.”

”I hope they don't use gerbils.”

(Doug, smiling at the camera:)
’.’I think he fell for it, eh?”

”OK, but like the catch on the
deal is that there are only a cer-
tain number of free agents al-
lowed on each team. Like, the
other ones have to stay, like, in
chains and stuff. And we don't
think that's fair.”

”Yeah, like 37 of the players
have to stay if the owners want
them to, but the rest, like, do
what they want. If I were in the
league and wasn't allowed to be-
come a free agent, I'd tell the
owners to ‘take off,’ and I'd retire
with my millions and open a beer
distributorship somewhere.”

”Ooh, that’d be great, eh? Like,
we could drink for free and stuff
— and watch the games on TV.”

”And, like, flip around with
that life-necessity we call the re-
mote control. What a beauty,
eh?”

”OK, so our first guest is a free
agentthat everyone knows. Let's
give a big Canadian welcome to
James Bond.”

”Wait a minute, you invited
James Bond onto our show? You
hosebrain! Like, James Bond only
exists in the movies, and he's a
secret agent, not a free agent. I

should have known better than to
let you handle the guests.”

”OK, so, like, we don't have a
guest this week, but I promise
we'll have a good guest and a
good topic next week. So, I'm
Doug McKenzie and this is my
brother Bob, and we'll see you
next week on the Great White
World of Sports. Do it.”

Cooo, loo coo coo coo coo
coo coooo... Cooo, loo coo coo
coo coo coo coooo...

”How’d we do?”

”James Bond. Way to go, eh?
You really blew that one, hoser."

Thus, the media, especially tel-
evision, will talk more about how
Sherman Douglas’ shooting was
off and why the Orangemen
could not successfully get the ball
inside instead of analyzing Pitt's
success.

Unranked teams who score
major upsets tend to be regarded
as ”a flash in the pan.”

scored upsets this season, four to
be exact, and three of these were
on the road (Florida, Syracuse,
Seton Hall). The Panthers just re-
cently seem to be getting credit
where it is due.

Despite suggestions that Pitt is
a made—for-television team, an in-
consistent squad, or just plain un—
predictable, what people are
seeing is a young team just start-
ing to gel as they get used to play-

ing with each other.

Matthews said, ”As far as we
are considered to be playing the
spoiler role, there's really a sim-
ple explanation for it.

”We just go out and play teams
like Seton Hall, Georgetown and
Syracuse as hard as we can. And
if we did that every game, we
would be one of the top-1 0 teams
in the country.”

”But you've got to remember,
this is a young team, and we're
trying to put it all together.
Strange things are going to hap-
pen, some good and some bad.”

Matthews believes people

should look at other games, espe- A

ciallv in the Big East, when evalu-

ating Pitt’s performance.

”We almost knocked off Vil-
lanova and Georgetown. If we
have a close game with those
teams, and we wind up losing,
people seem to be really upset.
I don't get it because they didn’t
expect us to have a chance of
winning in the first place,” Mat-
thews said. ,

Pitt court strategy appears to be
working effectively lately. Against
St. John's, the Panthers began to
shut down Redman Jayson Wil-
liams, the team’s leading scorer
and rebounder, in the second half
when it really mattered.

from a man—to—man to a 2-3
[defense], and it really hurt me af-
ter a while.

’’It was especially tough getting
the ball to the outside in the se-
cond half.”

St. John's Coach Lou Carnesec—
ca was visibly disappointed after
the Monday night loss, specifical-
ly because of who he lost to.

”That’s a good ball club [Pitt]
out there, and that's why I'm so
upset with the loss,” Carnesecca
said.

”Maybe Pitt doesn't get the
hype that some other teams do,
but some of the clubs they've
beaten are simply outstanding.”

Evans is particularly impressed
with his team's attitude, work
ethic and execution.

”Chemistry has a lot to do with
the number of wins,” Evans said.

lt--appears that the chemistry is
becoming a little stronger lately.

Thus, instead of labeling the

Panther basketball team as the '

”cardiac kids” or the made-for-
television upset squad, perhaps
one should take into account the
simple fact thatthe Panthers are
a young, struggling team who are
just starting to pull themselves
together-

The Panthers are capable of

anything on any given night. This ‘Ck-

includes Saturday night, as they

‘ may upset Syracuse yet again or
‘may get blown out by 20 or more

points.

ery day_ is an anything—can-
