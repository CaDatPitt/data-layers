SGB member criticizes board conduct

By Randy Legersky

sum‘ Writer

:3, Student Government Board member Michael Golden

stood before the board on Wednesday and levied a
number of complaints against his fellow members,
among them‘ misuse of presidential power, poor
management of the student—activities fee, and the
priorities of board members.

“I feel a need at this time to let it be known to all
students that the Student Government Board, I feel, is not
a representative body  While I am quite sure that this
board has completed more projects than any board in
history, it should be understood by all that certain
members of the board have been ignorant of our
fundamental purpose,” said Golden.

The possible abuse of presidential power was also
addressed by Golden, saying that there was no process
to ﬁnd someone to sit on the presidential-search
committee. Another problem is the ﬁring of Ken Hunt,
student-relations committee chairperson, without
consulting the entire board, said Golden.

“It is a pretty extreme misuse of power when the rest

__ of the board doesn’t get to ﬁnd out [about an issue] before

it happens," said Golden.

Shepard silent about

Golden's accusations

By Scot Ross .
Editor in Chief

Although at last Wednesday’s board meeting
Student Government Board member Michael Golden
accused SGB Presidentjulie Shepard of misusing
her presidential power, Shepard refused comment
about this issue, as well as the other complaints
Golden expressed about board conduct.

After Golden spoke Wednesday, Shepard said
she would follow up on each point he made, but
neither she nor several board members will voice
an opinion of agreement or disagreement with
Go1den’s statements.

Golden stated that negative student input given last
year about Telefact went unheard at SGB.

particular Terry Tinnin [last year’s Black Action Society
president] and Sharon Kuhn, who is the the president of
the Nursing Student Association, were very opposed to
the nearly $40,000 to be spent on T elefact. Their criticisms
went largely unheeded, as we now have a $38,000 project
that most likely won’t be continued after this year,” said
Golden. ‘

Golden explained the abuses of power and the misuse
of funding that has taken place within the SGB this year.

“Recently, although I staunchly opposed it, another
$15,000 was approved for a bus shelter that would be
aesthetically pleasing for the [Cathedral of Learning]. This
bus shelter will hold approximately eight to 10 people. I
ask you, if it rains and there are 30 people waiting for the
campus bus, isn’t it nice of the board for the $15,000 so
that a few people can stay dry? I ﬁnd that ridiculous.”

He also questioned the importance of SGB members
being sent away to conferences.

“What about sending four people to the annual concert
conference at Texas A&M for four days? I defy anybody
on this board to tell me what they got [out o f going to
the conference]; what new programs did come out of it?
 When the allocations committee revised this number
down to one person, the board voted against it,” said
Golden.

Presidential search excludes CGS

losing its provosts and higher

News Editor

After weeks of trying to get a
College of General Studies student
on the presidential- search
committee with no results, CGS
Student Government Council is
still ﬁghting for representation
on the 22-member committee.

“We are just getting nowhere.
We are getting things like, ‘Well
we have already chosen one
undergraduate, and the
committee can only be so big

effectiveness,’ and a lot of throat
clearing, and that is it,” said Sean
Knight, council vice president.
Knight said that since the
council is recognized as the
governance group for CGS
students it should have been
asked to pick a representative for
the search committee, just as the
Student Government Board and
the Graduate Student Professional
Association were. CGS/SG, SGB
and GSPA are usually all
represented on searches for

administration, Knight said.

“We are the second largest in
population in the university; we
are a recognized government of
the university, and to get the total
lack of respect that we got is
mind boggling," Knight said.

Knight said that the lack of
respect for CGS is the reason he
thinks it was excluded from the
committee.

“In CGS we have always been
treated like we’re second-rate.

From the ﬁrst day of classes until the first semester break, a

Gubernatorial candidate Barbara Hafer made her
position on abortion clear when she spoke at a pro-
choice march yesterday.

“Choice is an issue of basic fundamental freedom.
It is our right to be able to choose, as United States
citizens, as women, as men who care about women,”
said Hafer. “We are not for abortion; we are not
promoting abortion in the sense that we believe
abortion is the right thing to do."

Gov. Robert Casey would not only limit a woman’s
right to choose, but he has also denied family-
planning rights, according to Hafer. . I

Approximately 70 pro—choice activists marched
from Carnegie Mellon’s Skibo Hall to the William
Pitt Union Sunday in a march and rally sponsored
by the Vivian Campbell Fund.

“The focus today was keeping abortion safe and
legal for poor women, and because of this march
a substantial contribution was made to the Vivian
Campbell Fund at Women's Health Services so that
low-income women will have access to safe, legal
abortion," said Mary Lipscomb Litman, public-
relations director at WHS.

Kip Dawson, a coal miner who is working within
her union for women's rights, spoke about the
necessity of freedom of choice.

“Our women and men are not free so long as
women do not have the fundamental right to make

decisions on what we do with our bodies, when
and how and what the consequences are, ” she said.

Janet Catov, the associate director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League, spoke about the
need “to be involved in this political process, to tell
those legislators that it is a woman’s right to make
that most personal and private choice, not theirs.”

Almost 50 anti—choice demonstrators also stood
near the union, chanting and sometimes praying.

Some of these demonstrators came from the
Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio.

“My understanding [is that we came here] just to
show that the majority of students in the universities
in Pittsburgh aren't pro-choice, but they're pro-
life,” sophomore Scott Anthony said.

Theresa McDonald, a freshman, also from
Steubenville, said she came “because I really believe
in life. I just feel it’s important to show that there are
a lot of students out there.”

Mary Litman said the march was a success.

"The rally today brought together a lot of pro-
choice people that really need to be uniﬁed in
doing what the speakers here have said, that on
Election Day we really need to get out there and
vote and vote pro-choice,” she said.

“If we don't have a pro-choice governor and a
pro—choice General Assembly, women in
Pennsylvania are going to lose the right to a safe,
legal abortion. The message today was unity; the
message today was pro-choice, and we should all
remember that on Election Day, “ said Litman.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, October 22, 1990

 

By Aimee Wolﬂnger
Staﬂ’ Writer

Approximately 100 Pitts-
burghers were “given a dose” of
information concerning an oral
alternative to abortion at a
symposium on the French
abortion pill RU486 at Mellon
Institute on Saturday.

RU486, developed in 1980 by
French physician Dr. Etienne-
Emile Baulieu, induces an
abortion without surgery when
given with prostaglandin, a
synthetic hormone.

Since the latter part of 1988,
over 44,000 women in France
between five and seven weeks
pregnant have had the option to
take RU486 as an alternative
method to -a surgical procedure.
Statistics have shown that RU486
is 97- to 99-percent effective.-

Dr. Suzanne T. Poppema, a
physician in family practice in
Seattle, Wash., spent a sabbatical
in France conferring with
physicians involved in the use of
RU486 during the fall of ‘1989.

She said that some doctors think
the pill could be used to treat
several diseases in addition to
being an alternative to abortion.

According to Poppema, RU486,
also known as mifepristone, is a
progesterone antagonist that
blocks the normal mechanisms
of pregnancy.

“RU486 attaches to cells with
progesterone sites and causes the
uterus to shed its lining and expel’
a fertilized egg,” she said.

Because mifepristone attaches
to progesterone sites only,
researchers have found that
RU486 could be a possible cure
for many diseases, including
breast cancer, Cushing’s
syndrome, brain tumors and
glaucoma.

“It is a very safe medical
treatment for various diseases that
do not just focus on women,”
said Poppema. “RU486 presents
many new options for women
and also men.” '

Although this “miracle” drug
has been successful in France,
whether the Food and Drug

Administration will ever release
rnifepristone in the United States
is questionable.

Although the American Medical
Association, the largest doctors’
organization in the nation, has
passed a resolution that gives the
U.S. the ability to study the drug,
RU486 is on the FDA’s banned-
substance list.

According to Simon Heller,
s pecial—projects attorney with the
American Civil Liberties Union
Reproductive Freedom Project,
three major sources of opposition
to RU486 exist. ,

Roussel-Uclaf, the French
pharmaceutical company that
manufactures RU486, is
withholding the drug because of
negative publicity and pressure
from anti—abortion advocates,
according to Heller. This makes it
virtually impossible for the FDA
to get use of the drug for further
study, he said.

Heller said that pro—life groups
have been pressuring the U.S.
government and threatening to
boycott Roussel-Uclaf if RU486 is

Abortion pill may have other medical uses

patented in this country.

The Republican Party, mainly
the Bush administration, is also
opposed to mifepristone, Heller
said. The goal of the Republican
Party is to restrict abortion and
restrict the use of contraceptives
in the United States, according to
Heller.

“We should not have to shy
away from RU486 as an
abortifacient," he said. “People
who have diseases are being
deprived of a drug that has been
found to be a possible treatment
for diseases other than an
unwanted pregnancy."

Both Heller and Poppema
agreed that more pressure should
be put on the government and
pharmaceutical companies to
make RU486 legal.

“We should address the
pharmaceutical companies and
the government. We can start by
writing to companies and
pressuring them into making
RU486 legal,” Heller said.

“We have to put pressure on

Protesters call for U.S.
withdrawal from Gulf

By Debbie Lincoln
Staff‘ writer

Calling for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia and more money for domestic programs, about 100
demonstrators picketed in front of the Federal Building downtown
on Saturday.

“[I believe it is a] war to serve the interests of the oil companies
and the U.S. military, not to serve the interests of the people of
the [United States] or the people of the Middle East. What we need
is a withdrawal of American troops from the Middle East; what
we need is an international conference to settle all the problems,”
said Dennis Brutus, Ph.D., chairperson of Pitt’s black studies
department and a guest speaker at the rally.

Many demonstrators criticized the government for putting the
interests of American oil companies above those of Americans.
In addition, demonstrators believed that it is not in the best
interests of the United States to take the military initiative. Instead,
the United States should follow the leadership of the United
Nations.

Oakland resident Chris Markwell believes that President Bush
and the Pentagon have been too militaristic in their approach
toward Saddam Hussein and advocates full support of the U.N.
in this matter. “Bush may believe he's protecting democracy, but
Arabs may interpret it as imperialist-type activity,” Markwell said.
“If anyone is to dislodge Saddam Hussein, it has to be the Iraqi
people.”

Most demonstrators felt that the U.S. economy could not afford
the fiscal strain of keeping a U.S. presence of 200,000 troops in

New president should focus on CAS

By Renee Crespy
Staff Writer

Pitt’s new president should
understand the need to strengthen
the College of Arts and Sciences,
according to several people at
last week’s open presidential-
search committee hearings.

“The new president must
understand what teaching is; a
university is not a business for
profit. We are not a proﬁt-making
organization. The second priority
is not to make the mistake of
letting’ the professional schools
take dominance; we have done
well with graduate schools but

not with the undergraduate
schools. The new president must
understand and respect that,” said
Professor Keith McDuffie.

Mathematics and statistics
Chairperson Stuart Hastings
agreed CAS has to be the priority.

“The key to achieving
excellence is a good CAS school.
In order to be the best, we must
attract the best students. We can
do that if we have a president
who can convince the community
we're on the way up,” Hastings
said.

Those present also commented
on what kind of person the new
president should be.

“Pitt is not a business; it exists
to teach and do research. We
need an energetic president. We
don’t need a celebrity to arouse
the people’s interest. We need
someone who will be open with
the faculty — something that has
been lacking,” said graduate
student Kevin Riley. ’

A common priority for the
faculty testifying was securing
more room for the 80,000 new
library books that will be arriving.

“The new president should
have a high priority for expansion
of a library. We have a library
crisis,” said history professor Van
Beck Hall.

violence toward Christians and
Moslems by continuing to

“The government is speaking

Rape

Continued from page 1
Pitt students and guests during
“Date Rape Prevention,” a lecture
sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council Thursday night.

In 1985 and 1986 the National
Center for the Prevention and
Control of Rape, located in
Washington, D.C., along with Dr.
Mary Koss, then a professor at
Kent State in Ohio, surveyed 6,000
college—age men and women on
their dating habits. The survey
showed that out of the 3,000
women who participated
anonymously, one out of four
women said that she had been a

victim of rape.

“The victim never talks about
it. She never considers herself a
victim because the act was done
by someone she knew or wanted
to know,” said Brady.

Out of the 3,000 men who
were surveyed in the study, one

- out of 12 admitted that he was a

rapist according to Brady’s
definition of rape. “lRape is] forced
sexual assault against the will of
a victim,” she said.

Brady told the audience that
there are too many victims and
too many victimizers involved in
sexual abuse. “Each of you
here probably have a story to tell
whether you want to or not and
in fact, that is your choice. Each
of you also know at least five
victims of this kind of [sexual]
assault,” said Brady.

“The five victims that you know,
including one which could be

you or could be someone sitting
next to you, were probably
victimized when they were kids
and never dealt with it,” she said.

Brady, author of the book
Father's Days and full—time crisis
counselor to

“There are too many victims in
the battered women/battered
girlfriend department. Every three
minutes in this country a female
is battered. In the general-rape
department, we have in America

Brady said that if you’re not the
kind of person to deliver a karate

that can be used in the case of a
sexual attack.

in her home

—Katherine Brady

said that she just
urinated all over

for 10 years as
a victim of
father—daughter incest.

“Fathers Days was about the
first 31 years of my life, and much
of that was spent as a victim of
sexual assault —— total isolation
and solitary confinement of my
own mind. I was absolutely alone,
and it was absolutely awful,” said
Brady.

Brady mentioned that before
the age of 12, one out of every
three girls and one out of every
five boys are sexually assaulted
in their home by someone they
are related to or someone who
takes the place of a blood relative.

“In general child abuse, we get

about a million kids a year who"

are assaulted in many ways, of
course being verbal, sexual,
physical, neglect and even some
of them for their sexuality. One in
10 kids are gay or lesbian and
they, too, are victimized,” she
said. '

a rape occurring every six
minutes,” said Brady.

Lizanne Batinich, a junior who
volunteered during the lecture to
act out what she would do in a
situation of sexual harassment,
said it makes a big difference in

. a threatening situation when you

know where other people are in
case they try to attack.

“I am always aware of who’s
around me and what I’m doing
when I’m walking down the street,
especially at night when you’re
walking toward Lothrop [Hall] or
whatever,” said Batinich.

’ “I can use the lights behind me
to see anybody’s shadow. Even if
someone is walking in front of
me or behind me, even if they
don’t mean anything, I still know
that they’re there, and I know
where they are. I try to keep a
definite distance, and I try to

99 his foot," said
Brady.

With the help of

Pitt student Erik Hultgren, Brady

performed some physical
methods that she learned in self-
defense classes. She

demonstrated how to deliver a
knee to the groin, an undercut to
the nose and how to box the
kidneys.

“You know you could do
serious brain damage there. You
can knock him right off balance

and keep him [staggering] if you’re
thinking and you have the
courage to deliver the blow, but
it takes practice. Take boxing
lessons," Brady said.

Other techniques that Brady
pointed out were boxing the ears,
gouging the eyes, scraping the
shin bone with the heel of a shoe,
biting, pulling hair and using
Mace.

Seniorjames Davis said that he
had somewhat mixed emotions
during the lecture.

‘‘I think that the lecture was
interesting and at times
frightening. The performances on
stage —— first they were amusing,
but then it became frightening
when it culminates to a date
rape,” said Davis.

Senior Suzanne Conrad said
that the lecture was beneﬁcial
and interesting.

, “From the lecture I learned that
I have to be a lot more aggressive.
I used to get harassed a lot. I
never did much except walk away
and ignore it,” said Conrad.

“RU486 could reduce the
emotional wear and tear on
women and reduce the
harassment they face from
protesters," said Poppema. “There
is an incredible burden of shame
put on women who want an
abortion."

Heller also said that RU486
may be a step toward the final
goal of a woman being able to
abort an unwanted pregnancy in
the privacy of her own home
without the intervention of her
physician.

“Having to speak to anyone
about her desire to have or not
have children infringes upon a
woman’s dignity,” said Heller.

According to Poppema, the
countries that would benefit the
greatest from mifepristone are
Third World countries, where
conditions are not up to par with
modern-day sanitation laws and
medical innovations.

“Every three minutes a woman
is dying from an illegal abortion,”
said Poppema.

Poppema thinks that RU486
would save thousands of women's
lives if it was available to Third
World nations on the black

Response

Continued from page 1
-Jay Gervasoni, who received

mhe most votes in last year's

election, would not comment.
oMichael Cohen, who is
running,for SGB president this
year, would not comment on
whether the allegations of
presidential misconduct were
valid, stating, “Whatjulie did was
in the lines of the constitution.”
-Brian Felgoise would not

34 comment.

Board member Don" Rhodes
said, “I don't think she stepped
out of bounds at all.”

Pat Abramowich, board
member, said he disagreed with
Golden's choice of forum for his
complaints. “I think that Julie
does basically a good job,” he
said, “but everyone can do better. "

 Rhodes concurred, “Though

most things are discussed in
private, they announced the
group’s decision. Michael just

, chose to air his disagreements in

public this time. That’s his right,
butl don’t think that was a proper
time and place.”

Member Bob Batchelor thought
the meeting was an appropriate
place for Golden to speak.

“It’s not necessarily that I share
his feelings, but I think Mike has
every right to voice his opinions
in the public meeting. I think if
he’s feeling frustrated with the
avenues being taken, then he has
every right to question Julie’s job
as president and the way the
reserve fund has been spent,”
Batchelor said.

Sunday, Golden said it is the
closed—door policy of SGB
decision making that he opposes.
“No one’s accountable to
anybody. They need some kind
of other group to check and
balance what happens up there.
I just think that eight people
aren’t representative of the whole
university, and certain decisions
are made on some of these
outrageous things that money is

being spent on. Somebody’s got
to be able to say they can't do
that.” ,

Golden said the amount of
presidential power was troubling.

“Opinions that the president
doesn’t want to hear are totally
ignored, and even when search
committees are made, the
president has the option to put
the people on the committee

who are going to go our way. I
mean, it works out in the office a
lot that I don't want to go
anybody’s way, and when I do,
I'm usually in the minority
because I don't know what they
are thinking up there. And that's
why I gave that speech. I don't
know whether or not they
understand what our purpose is.
It doesn’t seem that they do.’

two deans, one administrator, two
students, two trustees and several
representatives from outside the
university.

CGS/SG has taken several steps
to try to get representation.
William Harmon, vice president
for student affairs, wrote a letter
to the Board of Trustees asking
that CGS get a place on the search
committee. BOT chairpersonjohn

Marous replied that one
undergraduate representative on
the committee was enough.
Kevin Novak, judicial affairs
director for CGS/SG, said that it is
not too late for action to be taken
to get a representative. Novak is
going to meet with the chair-
person of the search committee,
trustee Farrell Rubenstein, to
discuss CGS/SG’s concerns.

"We’re going to show that we’re
going to put up a ﬁght to get
whatever we possibly can out of
this right now,” Novak said.

Novak said that he does not
feel that sophomore Lisa Campoli,
the undergraduate representative
chosen by the SGB for the search
committee, can represent the
interests of a CGS student.

“My question to Lisa is how can

 

she actually [represent] the views

of the CGS student? They start .

class at 5 p.m. How can she relate
to something like that when she
probably gets out of classes at S
p.m.? What kind of needs are
there for a person who works all

.day and comes to class at night?

How is she going to be able to
relate that to how she's making
her decisions?” Novak asked.

Student Focus
Group

Computing and Information Services (CIS) has developed a forum for studentinput
concerning the University's student computing services. This forum, the Computing and
Information Services Student Focus Group, has been meeting since September 1989.

The goal of the Focus Group is to review the computing lab services offered by
CIS and to provide input regarding the future direction of the labs.

The Focus Group is seeking interested individuals to join. If you would like to
participate, please attend the next meeting of the Student Focus Group on:

Friday, October 26

Room 525, William Pitt Union

 

With all due respect to William
Shakespeare, -I would like to start

off my article with his line “To be

or not to be, that is the question.”
Is [the College of General Studies]

to be recognized as a separate

student population or not?

There are three student govern-
ments recognized: Student Gov—
ernment Board, Graduate Profes-
sional Student Association, and the
College of General Studies Student
Government. Two were asked to
have a representative sit on the

.search_ committee for the new

president of the university. I'll give
you three guesses as to who was
not invited, and the first two don't
count. It seems that somewhere
along the line we, CGS Student
Government, became a “special
interest” group. That’s like saying
the football team doesn't generate
revenue. ~

If you are getting the impression
I’ve made, give yourself a gold star.
I'M MAD AS HELL! You should be,
too. We are the second—largest
student population, with approxi-
mately 10,000lactive students, with
over 6,000 attending classes this
term. It seems we‘ are on the out-
side looking in on a big university

banquet. Occasionally someone I

sees us at the window and gives us

a morsel of food. When we reach‘

for more, someone shuts the win-
dow on our hands. This time the
person closing the window is John
Marous, chairman of the Board of
Trustees and head of the search
committee for the new president.
Of course, Council can't be sure
because all we get is the runaround

'0 to our questions. Any more run-

ning around, and I’m going to start
ﬂying. At least I would earn fre-
quent-ﬂyer miles (lots of them).
‘To the mysterious powers who
used their incredible wisdom to
decide who is to sit on the commit-
tee that will select the university's
new leader, I have several almost

embarrassingly easy questions:

1) Who decided we, CGS Stu-

.. dent Government, are a special

interest group?

2) Why were we not asked to sit
on this search committee when we
have been asked to sit on other
administrative search committees?

3) If you wanted only one under-
graduate representative, why were
we not asked to sit down with SGB
to help select an undergraduate
representative? '

Well, while the powers—to-be
clear their throats, look at each
other and figure out some answers,

Letters

here is a suggestion to you fellow
students. If you are as mad as I am,
irked, or even mildly concerned
over this lack of respect to you and
your fellow students, register a
complaint. “But Sean, how can we
do this?” Simple! Before or after
class stop in the CGS student-gov-
ernment ofﬁce, Room 615 in the
William Pitt Union. You can also
call the office (sorry, Jean) at 648-
7895, and we will take your mes-
sage verbatim.

I would like to leave you with
this thought. In a short time the
university will begin looking fora
new president. This person will
step in not knowing we exist. Why?
Because no student from CGS was
there to greet the new president
when (s)he came through the door.

Stop advertising pornography
I was utterly appalled at your
pornographic advertisement in the
Oct. 10 issue. I feel disgusted that
the University of Pittsburgh, which
promises to give its students an
outstanding education, cultural
diversity, experience in independ-
ence and aid in the process of

maturity, would support such a

morally desecrating display. I would
think that there would be many

other sources around the Pitt
campus area which would sponsor
The Pitt News, instead of gaining
the support of a pornographic
phone line. Such sponsors might
be fast-food restaurants, clothing
stores or beauty parlors. [...] I hope
that you, The Pitt News, will stop
your support of it because it lowers
the stature of the University of
Pittsburgh and its newspaper and
is embarrassing to the entire stu-
dent body

Trina Dougherty

Israel unfairly accused
The Pitt News has always held

, itself out as a beacon of light and

fairness. You abandoned that noble
credo in your scathing blast against
the state of Israel in your editorial
of Oct. 16.

You place sole blame for the
recent deaths of 19 rioting Pales-
tinians on Israel and liken the deaths
to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait!
What nonsense!

You failed to mention that the
Palestinians who were shot by
Israeli defense forces were not
simply “Palestinian protestors,” but
terrorists who had brutally and
without provocation attacked with
stones a group of Israeli worship-
pers during one of the holy weeks
of the Jewish calendar. .

You state that the fact that th
United States voted to condemn
Israel in the United Nations is
symbolic of the world’s resolve
against Israel. This also is not true;
it is symbolic only of the U. S. desire
to maintain the fragile American-
Arab alliance against international
thug Saddam Hussein.

Inserted into the U.N. resolution
condemning Israel at the urging of
the United States was the fact that
“innocent worshippers" were at-
tacked by the Palestinians.

I am not always in accord with
Israel's goals and its tactics to
achieve them, but you do yourself
and your readers a great disservice
by not reporting the facts of this
horrible tragedy fairly and hon-

estly.

Oren M. Spiegler

We are writing in response to the
article that appeared in The Pitt
News on Oct. 16 titled “Israeli sanc-
tions needed ...” We are very an-
gered by its content and obvious
bias, as well as the misinformation
it has passed on to the student
body.

First of all the article compares
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to the
events which took place in Jerusa-
lem last Monday. Iraqi action against
Kuwait was a completely unpro-
voked, offensive maneuver which
entailed the occupation and an-
nexation of another country and
now threatens world peace. The
Israeli security forces reacted de-
fensively to an unprovoked attack
and premeditated attack by Pales-
tinian Arabs on innocent Jews

worshipping at the Western Wall '

— Judaism’s holiest site.

The article also says, “Israeli
police opened ﬁre on rioting Pales-
tinian protestors ...” This is a gross
distortion of the facts. The bottom
line is that while thousands of
Jewish worshipers prayed at the
Western Wall, they were bom-
barded by 3,000 Palestinian Arabs
hurling rocks and broken bottles.
This is hardly a “protest” as is
claimed but an outright attack on
innocent lives. Israeli forces re-
sponded by firing tear gas and
rubber bullets to disperse the at-

tacking Palestinians in order to ’

protect the worshipers. Only as a
last resort,after these measures
failed, was live ammunition used.
It must be remembered that rocks
can kill. Dozens of Israeli soldiers
have been killed and hundreds
wounded by the throwing of rocks.
Two weeks ago an Israeli reservist
was stoned and burned to death on
a main street in the Gaza Strip as
hundreds of Palestinian Arabs
looked on. Countless other stoning
deaths of Israelis have gone unre-
ported.
A cartoon which appeared on
the same page as the article refers
to the events which transpired in
Jerusalem last Monday as a “mas-
sacre.” We are very angered at this
term, which is completely biased.
Placed side by side with the article
“Israeli sanctions needed ._.." pro-
vides for a dangerous misrepre-
sentation of the story. While we
see that it is the right of every
individual to express an opinion —
in this case an anti—Israel opinion
—— it is the professional responsi-
bility of the paper to fully present
the opposing view. The paper
cannot pretend that, by placing on
the same page the article “U.S.
should reconsider arms sale, ” which
was written weeks prior to the
events which occurred in Jerusa-
lem on Oct. 8 and refers to a totally
different subject, represents this
opposing view[...]

how bad it is:

-Hey, does everybody know
that Student Government Board
elections are coming up soon?
OK, does anybody know, or for
that matter, care?

The SGB has been catching a
lot of heat lately from many di-
rections, even from some of its
own members. Student groups
aren’t happy because they aren’t
equally represented on the board.
Some are displeased about the
decision-making process in se-
lecting Lisa Campoli to the presi-
dential-search committee. Yet the
apathyof the students these days
makes this campus resemble a
permanent Saturday-morning
hangover.

This year it seems that there are
some very qualiﬁed candidates
who want to make a difference
for the student body. If anybody
remotely cares about being treated
as students and not second-class
citizens, ﬁnd out more about these
candidates. A

And who knows? The students
just might turn this into an inter-
esting election if voter turnout is
anything like the really important
decisions, like homecoming king
and queen.

dates, I sure wish I could say that
there was one for the gubernato-

rial race in Pennsylvania this year.

staunch pro-life stance. On the
other hand, most people will
probably end up voting for him
because of a total lack of confi-
dence in Republican Barbara
Hafer. _

In her campaign Hafer has
reverted to name-calling (calling
Casey a “redneck Irishman from
Scranton”) and has taken per-
sonal trips paid for by campaign
money. She is attempting to turn
this year’s race into a one-issue
election: abortion rights. Casey
has been trying to keep Pennsyl-
vania’s budget in check, espe-
cially since the Department of
Public Welfare fell behind by
more than’$lOO million in pay-
ments. '

I don’t think there was ever a
time when a third candidate was
so desperately needed. Where is
Mickey Mouse when you need
him?

oThe federal budget has all of
our nation's members of Con-
gress ﬁghting not only to keep
the nation from going under, but
to keep their jobs as well. Demo-
crats want to raise taxes on the
rich. Republicans want to raise
taxes on the middle class (I think
President Bush hasn’t exaaly been
the most decisive person on the
subject; he's changed his mind
three times.) Who are we sup-
posed to back?

All I know is that Bush can’t
keep signing his temporary bills
to keep the government running.
Come Wednesday, should Con-
gress not come up with some-
thing permanent, Bush should
send Congress home. Then maybe
something could get accom-
plished. ~

-2 Live Crew has ﬁnally made
it into the clear. After a Florida
record salesman was convicted
of selling their album As Na$tyAs
They Wanna Be because a judge
declared it obscene, three mem-
bers of the group were acquitted

of their own obscenity charges.

Maybe it's me, but I think that e

if everybody just kind of ignored
them, they would go away.
They're not that good with all of
their vulgarity. I doubt if they’d
be any better without it. Just
ignoring them would cause them
to do something that they were
better at, something other than
rapping.
0Wow, it’s nice to see that the
Middle East is such a calm, stable
place. As if the world needed
another problem in that region,
Israel started acting up in the
West Bank area again. Last week
Israeli forces fired upon Palestin-
ian rioters at the Holy Wall in
Ierusalem,‘killing 19. Yesterday a
Palestinian avenged his people
by slaughtering three Jews. A
Palestinian group has told all
Palestinians in the West Bank not
to rest until these deaths are
completely avenged. ‘
This problem is not going to
end until both sides can sit down
and negotiate under a United
Nations summit. As soon as the
Palestinians find a reasonable
negotiating team instead of the
Palestine Liberation Organization,
at least there will be a possibility
of a peaceful resolution. Until
then, however, there will not be
peace in the Middle East

Dukes near-election disturbing sign of times

doubt that this man's sentiment
really arose purely out of his own
sense of sympathy to his girlfriend,
as he as he attempted to put it. A
statement like that is nothing but
pure hatred looking for some kind
of justification for its existence.
Duke called his near victory

A chill wind is blowing across Louisiana.

David Duke, ex- Ku Klux Klan grand wizard-
cum-senatorial candidate ran unendorsed on
the Grand 01’ Party ticket, promising to deliver
the citizens of this state from their ﬁscal woes.
Somehow this hateful bigot has managed to
establish himself with the voters as a serious
prospect.

Mr-. Duke walked away with 44 percent of the
vote. Tulane University history professor Law-
rence Powell, who was interviewed in The New
York Times, said, “The voters are really angry
and volatile and looking for some kind of savior

Curious as to what kind of people want
saving, the Times reporter ventured into the
suburbs to speak with college—age Duke sup-
porters. One male said, “[Blacks] are taking
everything away from us, and the white race is
going down the tubes. It’s time someone spoke
up for white people.” Amid shouts of “white
power” and Nazi slogan shouting from a half-
dozen compatriots, the male complained about
a scholarship a black student from his high
school had received. Although having a higher
grade—point average than the strident, the male’s

' girlfriend was not offered one. His solution: “

heartedness and their Christian
spirit. “

Pardon me, folks, but if this is Christian
goodness, then I’ll take evil godlessness any
day.

To be fair, Duke’s near election was obvi-
ously more than a freak neo-Nazi backlash.
Louisiana is a state that never recovered from
the decline of the oil industry. People believe
welfare recipients to be taking a free ride at the
expense of the middle class. White youths
frustrated with the lack of employment oppor-
tunities see affirmative action as giving minori-
ties an unfair advantage in the job market.

That whites, particularly males, have histori-
cally enjoyed better job opportunities than
minorities means little to a white person facing
a bleak ﬁnancial future. Some people perceive
minorities as “using” their marginal status to get
jobs. Irrational and false notions, these myths
stick because they strike to the core of the white
male’s fears that minorities may “take over.”
Needless to say, it also reﬂects a lot of bitter-
ness.

What this country has yet to realize is that
impoverished (especially rural) people are in as
much of a powerless position as other marginal
groups.

The industrial age of high paying, blue—collar

work has given way to the era of the white-
collar skilled worker. Skilled work requires
training, and the cost of higher education has
risen, while ﬁnancial aid has decreased. While
they may have the cultural values of their upper
rniddle-class counterparts, poor and rniddle—
class white males have none of the economic
benefits of being part of the power structure.

With limited career opportunities, frustration
and bitterness turn to anger and hatred looking
for a target. 9

Scratch already existing sexism and racism,
and under the surface you’llﬁnd violent hatred.

A savvy politician can easily manipulate these
sentiments to his or her own beneﬁt. Take
joblessness, malaise and pent-up frustration;
add a scapegoat and a charismatic leader, and
you come up with David Duke (one columnist
described him as a “fascist Fabian").

Though The New York Times noted the
political pundits’ shock that a hate—monger
could win so much of the popular vote, the
election ﬁgures are not surprising; historically,
these social and economic factors were essen-
tial for leaders of totalitarian regimes gaining
popular support.

While we haven’t reached that stage yet, the
country's political climate of the past decade
suggests that we are moving in that direction.
What we ﬁrst need to do is to get over the myth
of America's “classless society”, to include the
economically disadvantaged in the Civil Rights
Act and afﬁrmative action and to reshape our
existing job and educational programs to in-
clude underprivileged people. While this may
not rid this country of sexism and racism, it will
be step toward defusing hatred.

Bowl Blues...
Pitt hampers postseason with 27-20 loss

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

For Louisville head coach
Howard Schnellenberger, beating
the Pitt Panthers was the greatest
thing that has happened to his
football team since he took over
the program in 1985. For Pitt
Coach Paul Hackett, it was simply
another day of watching hisJekyll-
and-Hydeoffense fail once again.

“We just sputtered, sputtered,
sputtered and sputtered,” Hackett
said. “I think of the number of
times a long pass was called back
because of holding, a guy
roughing the passer, moving in
his stance offsides, whatever it
was. And then all of a sudden,
BOOM! The light comes on. It did
against Syracuse at the end [of
the game]; it did here at the end.
to find some
consistency on offense.”

It did indeed appear as if two
Pitt offenses showed up on
Saturday. And the student section,
which was not even half-full at
the beginning of the game and
completely dwindled to near
nothing by the fourth quarter, did
not stick around long enough to
witness the positive side of the
Pitt offense. In fact, most fans
took to the streets in the third
quarter when Louisville was .
leading 24-6.

Pitt’s Jekyll unit was near totally

result of two Scott Kaplan field

Cardinals Ralph Dawkins (22) and Curtis Lipsey(20) had goodreason, felt we needed to play a game

away,” Schnellenberger said. “Pitt
has the best personnel of anyone
we play all season. [These were]
two great teams who believe in
themselves and have great work
ethics and laid it on the line. It’s
a big victory for us.”

The Cardinal offense impressed
all day. Second—team halfback
Curtis Lipsey scored the first two
Louisville touchdowns on 3- and
2-yard runs, respectively.

Redshirt first-year student
fullback Ralph Dawkins, while
not scoring, led the Cardinals in
both rushing and receiving on
the day, exploding for most of his
yardage in the .latter half of the
game. Dawkins posted up 88
yards on 23 carries and pulled
down five Browning Nagle passes
for 69 yards, including a 40-yard
reception.

With the game seemingly out
of reach for Pitt in the fourth
quarter with the score 27-6, Van
Pelt’s two TD strikes to Redmon
gave rise to a faint glimmer of
hope. But it was just that— faint.

Oﬂense needs to ma/ee earlier appearance

By Derek Willis
stay Writer ,

Just when the Panthers seemed to get their
offense healthy and working, along comes a
team like Louisville to disrupt things. The
Cardinals’ defense cannot take all of the
credit for Saturday's win, however, because
Pitt’s offense did not present them with much
of a challenge for three quarters in an
inconsistent showing.

If games were played only in the fourth
quarter, the Panthers could be undefeated.
But as it is, this offense of high expectations
has failed to get the job done.

At the post—game press conference, Pitt
Coach Paul Hackett compared the loss to the
West Virginia game, adding, “Certainly our
team took a step back from where we think
we should be at this point because we’re
clearly not there.” The only difference between
the Louisville game and the one vs. WVU is
that the defense played better Saturday, while
the offense came to life too late.

So where is the Hackett offense? After
returning the entire starting backﬁeld from

last season, this unit had lofty goals. ‘ But the
dreaded three I’s (injury, inexperience and
inconsistency) have taken their toll, and the
powerful Panther attack is missing.
Inconsistency seems to be the biggest
problem, although the loss of Curvin Richards
would relegate most teams to an average

ANALYSIS

status. -

But the statistics tell another story. Olanda
Truitt, the team's leading receiver, caught but
one pass. T ruitt saw only four passes come
his way, and none during the fourth-quarter
comeback. While Darnell Dickerson had his
finest receiving performance, T ruitt shouldn't
be forgotten.

Certainly motivation should not have been
a cause for the sputtering of the offense in the
first three quarters. All last week Hackett and
his players remarked on how their backs

were against the wall and the importance of
winning the rest of the games. For three
quarters, however, the offense did little to
suggest a team with few options. “What
happened in the fourth quarter? All of a
sudden it’s a different offensive football team.
I can't answer that  I wish I could," Hackett
said.

The opportunities squanderedby the offense
clearly cost Pitt the game. The defense set up
the offense at the Louisville 30-yard line and
again at the 25, resulting in only a Scott
Kaplan field goal, leaving Hackett frustrated.
“When you get the ball on the 30 and then on

the 25, and you can only get three points,
getting there twice, you've got some real
problems,” he said.

The problems seem to be with the “skill”
positions because the offensive line fared
well against an excellent defense. A consistent
offense will be needed this weekend to face
Notre Dame, a game which Hackett calls “the
highlight of our season.” The offense can't
afford to wait until the last period to get going
again. This simply puts too much pressure on
the defense and special teams.

After two days of coasting
to easy victories, the Lady
Panther volleyball team had
its hands full yesterday
when it took two-and-a-
half hours and five games
before beating Hofstra
University. A

Pitt defeated the
unranked Flying
Dutchwomen at Fitzgerald
Field House, 15-17, 15-11,
15-8, 8—15,15-11.

“We went ﬁve [games]
with them last year,” said
Pitt Coach Sue Woodstra.
“They’re a team we have a
hard time with.” 1

That proved to be an
understatement as the first
game alone lasted a
grueling 35 minutes. Both
teams looked worn as they
came off the court. Pitt’s
morale seemed low after
the‘ break, and it had a
difficult time pulling ahead
for the victory.

‘With the score tied at
one game apiece, the
pressure was mounting.
Suddenly Pitt was playing
a new game. Scrambling
on the court to maintain its
9-1 lead, Pitt managed to

game of the match. They
must not have been
thinking about the task at
hand, though. Pitt could
not grasp the lead in this
game. The crowd was
awakened by this display,
shouting “Dee-fense!”

“We just get shaky,” said
Woodstra as she described
her squad’s style of play.
This inability to stay in
control forced Pitt into the
fifth game. i

It was obvious the players
were tired as the pace
slowed. The Lady Panthers
stayed close to the ground,
hoping to keep their
defense on top. This hope
seemed to fade quickly as
Pitt fell behind, 8-11.

‘ Suddenly Pitt came alive,

Steelers run into unpleasant reality on the West coast

By Mike Milliron

and Mike Rampa
The Pitt News

Everyone was comparing this
week's Steeler-49er match-up to
when these clubs met in 1984.
The scenario for that game was
similar to this one.

A tough, pesky Steeler squad
set to play an undefeated 49er
team. The Steelers defeated the
49ers in 1984 by a score of 20-17,
dealing them their only loss that
year as the 49ers went on to win
the Super Bowl.

Unfortunately for the Steelers,
the result of yesterday's game
was not the same as in 1984, as
the Steelers took home a 27-7
defeat.

The Steelers’ No. 1-ranked pass
defense was going to be put to
the test against the air-happy 49ers
who put on a passing clinic a
week earlier in Atlanta. Taking
away San Francisco ’s quick—strike
ability would be crucial if the

Steelers were to have a chance_

for victory. ~

The initial game plan was to
run the football mixed with short
passes. In short, a ball-control
offense. Controlling the ball was
supposed to keep Montana and

Co. off the field. The best way to .

keep the 49er offense in check is
to have it on the sideline.

The Steeler offense succeeded
with that plan in the ﬁrst quarter.
Pittsburgh moved the ball well
on its first two possessions. One
resulting in a missed Gary
Anderson 50-yard field-goal
attempt, the second culminated
in a Bubby Brister to Richard Bell
touchdown strike.

Pittsburgh’s only score started
with a Woodson interception that
he returned to the 49er 35-yard
line. Running back Merril Hoge
ran the ball five times and Brister
once to set up the touchdown
pass.

Hoge had a good bit of success
on the ground early, picking up
nearly 5 yards per carry.

The 49ers answered
Pittsburgh’s early score with a
field goal. Montana hit running

back Dexter Carter and Tom
Rathman with several short
passes. On third and two at the
Steeler 22-yard line, linebacker
Bryan Hinkle made an open-
field tackle on a scrambling
Montana to force the field goal, a
39-yarder by Mike Cofer.

Midway through the second
quarter, Steeler safety Thomas
Everett intercepted Montana to
halt a 50-yard drive. Everett
demonstrated excellent closing
speed as he picked the ball away
from Mike Sherrard.

However, the Steelers could
not capitalize on the interception
and ran three plays and punted.
Crucial point here, though.
Pittsburgh passed on third down,
netting an incompletion, stopping
the clock and giving the 49ers
enough time to mount a
touchdown drive before the half
ended. Had they nm on third
down, the Niners may not have
had the necessary time to score.

And the last thing any 49er
opponent should do is give Joe
Montana more time. As a result,

San Francisco took a 10-7 lead
into the locker room.

The 49er passing attack was
held in check in the first half, and
Rice's most significant
contribution was drawing an
interference call in the end zone
against cornerback David
Johnson.

It was all San Francisco in the
second half, or perhaps more
appropriately, a lack of Pittsburgh.

The‘49ers netted a Cofer field
goal after a 15-play drive, and
then the bottom fell out for the

In the fourth quarter, on 'a

And Montana did not drop back

whenever he got the chance.

lead, 13—11. Pitt then missed the
serve. Hofstra could not hold
serve. Pitt won the next two points
to put an end to a match that
should never have lasted four
games.

“I felt we should have been
able to control the match,” said
Woodstra. She stressed the team
needs to play to its ability in
defense so contests like Hofstra
will not become a habit.

Previously this weekend the
Lady Panthers broke their longest
losing streak of the season — a
whole two games ——by defeating
Boston College in three straight
games, 15-7, 15-4, 15—10, on
Friday. They gave a repeat
performance on Saturday with
Providence, winning 15-5, 15-12,
15-4..

“We’re starting to get our
confidence back,” said Woodstra
after winning both Big East
matches for the weekend. “This
is a good positive step. We’re
making progress to getting back
to where we should be.”

Pitt proved itself worthy of
being considered a powerhouse
in the Big East. Its strength at the
net showed as shot after shot was
blocked by the front line.

Pitt did not have to be at its best
to defeat Boston College. The

Eagles were plagued with bad
passing, an extremely weak
defense and the fact that except
for junior outside hitter Mary Ellen
MacKinnon and senior middle
hitter Jennifer Smith, Boston
College seemingly didn’t have a
player that belonged on the ﬂoor
against a team ranked in the Top
20.

Providence seemed stricken
with the same disease as BC. It is
basically a young team with only
three senior players, and it was
continuously caught off-guard by
the Lady Panthers. Providence
played a jumbled game, two
women going after the same ball,
and they didn’t watch the line.

The Lady Panthers will take on
Southern Illinois Friday at 7:30
p.m. at Fitzgerald Field House.
