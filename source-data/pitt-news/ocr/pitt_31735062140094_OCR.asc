_FlNAL scoR1=. 71 to 0

The Ohio University football team,
which hails from Athens, Ohio, was

, completely outclassed on Saturday by

the Pitt team, losing by the top heavy
score of 71-0. It wa.s a case of how

" ; many times the Pitt “varsity” could

run fromi one end of the ﬁeld to the
other, and they gbt tired running be-

fore the game was over.

 The Ohio team had the ball in their

and represented the only ground they

-gained during the whole game. On

the defensive side, Ohio’s halfback
Portz, and right end Sherman did

, especially well, once or twice getting

through and throwing the Pitt runner
But two men cannot play
a whole team.

The work of Captain Richards and

Budd for the Pitt team stood out be-
_yond the others, although the whole

team played mighty good football.
Lindsay surprised everybody by drop-
ping a perfect ﬁeld goal from the 41-
yard line. And Galvin managed to
get off a placement from the 36-yard
line line, besides_ kicking ten -goals
after touchdowns.

The weather was very winterish in-

deed, and the small crowd that turned.

out had a hard time keeping warm,
when

snow fell quite heavily. During the

- intermission,’ by way of variety, and

incidentally to keep warm, a‘ bunch of
students and alumni got up a scrub

ﬁeld, urged on by the cheers of the

performer, while G.  P. Baird
played the valiant part of the goat.

later Budd repeated the performance,

In the third quarter Dewar took the

ried the ball over for a touchdown

worked the ball up the ﬁeld. Brown
then added another by running 65

yards, and Galvin annexed three more‘

points by getting off a placement

tried to duplicate his ﬁeld goal, but

Red and Black Shows Old-Time
Form and Spirit and Wins,
8 to 0.—-Contest is Hard fought

 

Washington, Pa., Oct. 29.--In the
hardest football game seen at College
Park this season VV. and J. this after-
noon scored a touchdown and kicked
a goal from ﬁeld, maki_ng a total of
8. to 0 against Carnegie Tech of Pitts-
burgh. »

It was the ﬁrst time the Red and

Black -team of 1910 had crossed a

goal line, and was the ﬁrst time that
this yea_r’s eleven had shown some-
thing of that ﬁghting spirit that made
W. and J. teams ‘famous in the past.

In the ﬁrst two periods W. and J.
played splendid ball. The work of
the linesmen was notably brilliant.
The third period was Tech’s and the
visitors advanced the ball down the
field in good style. The real feature
in the old W. and J. form was in the
fourth period when Tech, blocking a
punt, secured the leather on W. and
J.’s four-yard line. In terrifﬁc asaults
the visitors made three yards. I

Then came the event of the day.
The Red and Black rallying to the
battle and holding the Plaid for
downs. In this great defense Cap-
tain Ingham, the W. and J. center,
was the leader, breaking through and
forcing back the play which threaten-
ed to score against _the locals.

Today’s game proved Coach David
Morrow’s contention that a lighter,
more aggressive line was a thing W.
and J. needed.

The line today was the lightest that
has represented the Red and Black
in years, but it made good with a
vengeance.

The one touchdown was made in
the first period. The ball was carried
up the ﬁeld bv Forsythe, Whitehill
and Wallace, the latter ﬁnally taking
Forsvthe failed to kick goal.

In the second pieriod‘W. and J. re-
covered the ball from Tech on the
visitor's 23-yard line. W..and J. made
a va1-., then lost ground and Forsythe
booted over a ﬁeld goal from the 35-
yard line.

In the third period and in the latter
part of the fourth the visitors were
up and coming. It was in the third
period that Tech showed its greatest
ability to gain‘ ground, at one point
making three ﬁrst downs in half a
dozen rushes.‘

Tech was particularly strong on the

forward pass and several times car- ,

ried through this play for substantial
gains. On the Plaid team Captain
Hatcher at right half, McCorkle at
left end and Blanchard atiquarter
back, performed most brilliantly.

Tech brought over 300 r_ooters on I

by a student band; W. and J. rooters.

LECTURE ON PUBLIC HEALTH. ‘

Dr‘. J. F. Edwards, whose work in
this city has been of great value, de-
livered a lecture in chapel on last
Friday morning. Many interesting
statistics on Public Health were

brought out, and Dr. Edwards stated *

that the length of human life is in-
creasing, owing to the improved con-
ditions under which people are living.

He urged that we should acquire . a.
knowledge of personal hygeine‘ and 5
its relation to the community in order"
to co-operate with the Health De- '3

partment. The tendency of medicine,
he says, is preventative, and the 20th
centurv will witness the prevention, of
disease. The opportunities for sani-

tary engineers were also iernphasized. I

ALUMNI NOTES.

The following letter is being mailed
to all the Alumni. There is only one
way -to reply—SUBSCRI’BE.

Dear Alumnus: '

Another year has begun in the his-
tory of our University. ‘The startiis
one of great promise and the possi-

bility is that this will be ‘the greatest

year thus far in ‘old Uni’s history.‘

As a loyal alumnus you are no doubt
interested in all the amazing progress

already attained bv the'University_

and no doubt you have often wanted
to keep in closer touch with your
Alma Mater but vou ha-ve been unable
to do so because of no adequate
medium. In order to, remedy this de-
feet and also.to keep up with the
rapid strides of old Uni, the Courant
Board for this year decided to dis-
continue the Monthly Courant and is-

sue a weekly pa.per entitled “THE V

PITT WEEKLY.” This paper (a
sample copy enclosed) chronicles all
important events which happen from

day to day in all parts of the Uni-- '

versity, also as accurate an account
of Alumni news as can be obtained.
No Alumnus can afford to doiwithout
this paper. The students and faculty
are enthusiastic and if the alumni are
also with us, we can issue a weekly
paper of the highest standard. Sub-
scriptions for school year by mail
$1.75. May I enroll you as one of
our Alumni subscribers?

Fellowship Plan
is Introduced

 

Prof. I Duncan Expects to Get
Good Results from New Plan

—-Large Institutions Use Plan .

 

fellowship in re-
industrial cheni-

A plan for
search work in
istry has been started by Pro-
fessor Duncan, which is in our-
suance of. the leading ins'titutions
of the country. ’By the new fellow-
ship plan the university will accept
from industrial concerns the founda-
tion of temporary industrial fellow-
ships, the exclusive purpose of which
will be to investigate some particu-
lar subject which will be of commer-
cial advantage ‘to the concern ﬁnanc-
ing them, as, for instance, the utiliza-
tion of some waste ‘product.

A fellow will be appointed by the
university to make special research
on the subject covering a period of
time from two to three years. The
holder of the fellowship will give his
whole time and at‘tention to the work,
with the exception of a few hours
each week when he will serve as in--
structor in the chemical department
of the university.

Men will be chosen carefully from
the graduates of the University, or
other educational institutions of rec-
ognized s‘tanding, who have shown
ability in research work to fill these
fellowships. _ .

.All discoveries made by these men
during the tenure of the fellowship
will become the property of the sup-
porting company, subject to certain

conditions in‘ the agreement upro-
The fellow shall prepare a

monograph of the results achieved
and after the expira'tion of three
years the University shall have the
right to publish such results as will
not injure the company’s interests.
Beneﬁts of the plan are mutual.
The University gains increased oppor-
tunities of fulﬁlling its functions in
promoting research, it gets the tem-
porary beneﬁts of instructors who
have made a life study of chemistry
and the chemical department of the
University obtains, as Professor Dun-
can says, the catalytic inﬂuence of
these. '
In the University of Kansas, where
Professor Duncan came from, many
excellent results have been obtained.

UNIVERSITY PICTURES IN THE
PAPER.

The Gazette Times of week be-

fore last had an excellent reproduc-

tion of the University class ﬁght in
the Sunday supplement of the paper.
All the pictures were very plain and
many of the prominent Sophs were
plainly visible to the “naked eye.”
The Pittsburgh Leader recently ran
a ﬁne page of University pictures,
which embraced ‘the pictures of the
faculty of the school of economics,
the new school of medicine, and

others.

STUDENTS STRIKE.

Because 17 Colorado students were -

suspended by the faculty of the State
university for hazing, the entire stu-
den't body, numbering more than 500,
last week went on a strike and the
class rooms were deserted and stu-
dent guards were posted at all the
entrances to the‘ campus, to prevent
faint-hearted brethren from entering.

The ‘suspension of the studen’i:s
which brought on the strike resulted
from the initiation of freshmen into

a dormitory organization known as i‘

the “Dorm Rats.”

New instructors secured during the
summer were elected‘.

A committee was appointed to pre-
pare a bill making application to the
Legislature for an appropriation at
‘the forthcoming session.‘ The last

'1 appropriation was $325,500.00.

It was decided to observe the 125th
anniversary of the University, Feb-
ruary 28, 1912, by historical addresses
and the cdnferringof degrees. Com-
mittees were appointed to make prop-'
er arrangements and to preparea
program. '

It was the unanimous opinion of
the board that the grow'th oflthe Uni-
versity and the consequent demand
for larger equipment «and teaching
force imperatively require expansion
in the funds of the University. It
was accordingly decided to launch at

_once the movement to secure, not

only the $150,000.00 ‘to meet the
budget to June 30, 1910, but a per-
manent fund of $1,500,000 for endow-
ment and buildings, etc. Every pos-
sibleaetfort is to be made to- accom-
plish this by February 28, 1912, the:

date of the 125th anniversary, and

in any event by December 1, 1912. .

Well Said

, v.._.:_§

The following clipped‘ from the

State Collegian is highly pertinent-

and to the point:

“During the past few weeks our
attention has been called by several
prominent upper classmen to the
great amount of “Prep" school in-
signia——jerseys, sweaters and pins,
which may be seen adorning the
breasts of some of the fellows. The
freshmen are more guilty in ‘this re-
spect than are the members of the
upper classes, and naturally so for
they are the last to he graduated
from preparatory schools. However
after a man has been here a while he
begins to lose his “prep” school ‘ideas
and customs, and those little things of
which he was guilty but a shor't time
before now seem obnoxious to him.
This year more than ever before
there seems to be a tendency on the
part of a large number of under class-
men to bedeck themselves in the
variegated colors of their respective
preparatory schools. Now if- these
men will only stop long enough ’to

think that they are in “prep” school M

no’ more but on the other hand have
entered a real, living college, noth-
ing more will need to be said about
this matter.

We would not leave the impression
that we are in any way prejudiced
against preparatory school insignia.
Far be such an idea from our minds.
But’ we do believe that there are
places for everything and that col-
lege is not the place for displaying
“prep” school accumulations.”

BIOLOGY EXPEDITION.

The class in general zoology held
a ﬁeld trip on Tuesday, October 25.

The class, headed by'Dr. Walgren, .

left the school about 11 o’clock for
Vaneman, a small town about an
hour’s ride from the city on the
VVashington route. Many interesting

forms of life were discovered by the ’
members of the class. and a number »

of- specimens were brought back.
Among the more in'te-resting forms

(llSCOV€I‘C(1 was a small snake, which ‘

led the class a lively chase; a ‘num-
ber of different worms, among them
leaches; a turtle, which caused our
instructor to fall into the stream;
many snails, and other forms. The
class returned to school about 6
o’clock, worn out and loaded down
with the unfortunate victims of the
trip.

TWENTIETH CENTURY‘
ALTRUISM.
“What can the college do for me?”
is too often asked by the freshman.
The‘better way, as set (forth in the

ﬁrst sermon to the new students at ’

Yale, is to ask how the college can
qualify him to- do‘ something for
somebody else. A new ‘emphasis on
duty, as distinguished from rights, is
characteristic of these early years of
the twentieth century.-——Youth’s Com-
panion.

THE PITT WEEKLY

I University Reception

A Great Success

 

3 Students and Faculty Spend a

Pleasant Evening. -

The students and others who at-
tended the reception highly enjoyed

/the hospitality of the University on
_, ._Friday night of last week. The in-

S teresting program of music and read-
. ings which’was carried out was an
. agreeable surprise to nearly every-
 body, _and the dancing which followed
iwound up the evening’s pleasure very

ﬁttingly. '
” The reception by the faculty to the

new students demonstrates that good

fellowship among the new arrivals is

i . tobe the keynote of the University,

which makes in turn for a‘ better

‘ j_ understanding among the students,
 and between the students and faculty,

——aii inviting atmosphere for, work

‘ and study. It helps cultivate‘ that feel--
‘V'g.i_iig of affection and loyalty for the

school ‘and all that it stands for,
which is becoming so manifest in

gr-2;,yl)oth students and faculty.

Q C
* Alliance F rancaise
._._,..__..

A splendid showing has been made
for University studentstwho are in-
terested in’ French. The Alliance
Francaise, a society devoted to the
interests of the French language,
literature, art, etc., in. this city, has
organized a student corps (corps
etudiants) for the beneﬁt of the un-
dergraduates. Instead of the regular
dues, a nominal fee of two dollars per
annum is charged, and membership is
open to any student in the University.
One evening and one afternoon meet-
ing are heldeach month, at which
addresses in French are delivered
especially at the evening sessions, by
prominent lecturers and scholars.
The opportunity for hearing native
French in great variety is unexcelled,
a.nd should not be allowed to go by
the notice of those students of French
who desire more than class-room
routine. Further information may be
had from Dr. Harry, Room 403, Thaw
Building. '

THE WESTERN PENNA. PUBLIC
HEALTH CONFERENCE.

University Well Represented.

This conference will be held Nov.
29 and 30, and Dec. 1,. 1910, in the
Soldiers’ Memorial Hall, having three
sessions daily. It was organized 'at
the instance and under the auspices
of the Central Council" of the Asso-
ciated Charities. ,

The purpose is to bring together
for discussion in nine sessions the
most important suggestions now
making for progress in the philan-
thropic treatment of sickness’ and
promotion of health. Among the sub-
jects to be discussed are the Dis-
pensary of the School of Dentistry
and the Emma Kaufmann Clinic, both
of the University. of Pittsburgh.

On the committees in charge are
entered the names_of many who are
connected with the University: Geo.
M. P. Baird, ’08, is serving as _assist-
ant secretary to the General Commit-
tee; Dr. and Mrs.‘McC0rmick, Dr. S‘.
B. Linhart, Hon. G. W.-Guthrie, -Dr.
Blair, Dr. Edwards, Dr. Utley, and
many others have committee work.

SCIENCE CLUB.

In an election of ofﬁcers which took
place in the, meeting of the Science
Club last Wednesday night, the,mem-
bers chose W. T. Mitchell for presi-
dent and —- Lashley for the position
of secretarv. Miller and Lashley were
appointed as members of the pro-
gram committee. Another committee.
consisting of Jena, Chairman, Dice,
and the two faculty members of the
society, was appointed to consider the
drafting of a constitution.

The ﬁrst regular meeting will ,be
held sometime this week, when the
following program will be carried out:

Address, “The Purpose of the Club”

vestigators To-day?” Dean Fetter-

BIG TIME COMING.

,  smoker of generous magnitude is

) Committee of the E. S. A., and will-
he held on Saturday night, November

12, at the Fort Pitt Athletic ~Club,
Duquesne Way, near Sixth sereet.
Don’t forget the date. All students
of the Evening School, whether mem-
bers of the Asociation or not, are in-
vited.

Several gentlemen of known abilitv,
and several who do not suspect their
own accomplishments, will be called
upon to “go up front and speak a
piece.” ' '

Notice to Under-
graduate Athletes

 

Because of two football games re-
ported scheduled in our columns last
week, the “Weekly” has . been re-
quested to call the attention of stu-
dents to the following rules govering
athletics, taken from the Constitution
and Bv-Laws of the General Athletic
Committee:

Article III.

“Rule‘ 1. No schedule of races,
match games, or athletic exhibitions
arranged by any athletic organization
shall take effect until it has been ap-
proved by the General Athletic Com-
mittee, and no game shall be played
until it has been approved. '

Rule II. All match games, races,
and athletic exhibitions outside of
Allegheny County shall take place on
Saturday, unless permission for
another day is obtained from the
Eligibility Committee’ in writing,
which permission shall be with the
consent of the Deans of the depart-
ments to which the students belong.

Rule III. No game shall be played
away from Pittsburgh during an ex-
amination period, if it cause the ab-
sence from examination of any stu-
dent taking part in the ghme, except
by special permission of the Dean of
the department to which the student
belongs.”

PRIZES OFFERED TO
STUDENTS.

The “Pitt Weekly” desires to make
a timely suggestion in regard to the
competition for essay prizes offered
to undergraduates. We feel conﬁdent
that there are some in the University
who can at least make a creditable
showing. 3

The Julia Hogg Prize of $50 is
offered to women of the senior class.
Subject of essay: “The Women of
Most Potent Personality in the
Colony.” ' '

The other reward, one hundred dol-
lars,.will be given to the undergrad-
uate who presents the best paper on

. “National Arbitration.”

Aside from being an illuminating
piece of study, work of this character
would reflect favorably on the Uni-
versity. “ I

STUDENTSSOF THE SCHOOL on

The One Year Rule l)r.o_pped by -
Wash-Jeﬁ.’ i

It is deplorable that in striving to
set the ideal in this state,«W. & I.
should fall after losing a few games.
The folowing, clipped from a Pitts-
burgh daily, has been considered
worthy of appearing in these columns:

“At a meeting of the athletic asso-
ciation of Washington and Jefferson
College it was decided to rescind the
one-yearresident clause of the con-
stitution, which prohibited freshmen
from taking part in athletic events on
the va.rsity teams. _ The members of
the athletic committee say that the
one-year resident clause was adopted
three years ago_to break up_ the prac-
tice of employing professional ath-
letes in college and to ir_nP1'0V€ ath‘
letics in the colleges in western’
Pennsylvania. _

At the time this rule was adopted It
was thought other colleges in western
Pennsylvania would adopt the Same
rule, but those in charge of athletics
in the different colleges and_univer—
sities in western Pennsylvania were
not inclined to share the opinion that

members of the freshmen classes.

should be debarred from representa-
tion on the varsity athletic teams and
did not fall in line with the policy set
by Washington and Jefferson. By the
adoption of the one-year resident_
clause the varsity athletic teams or
Washington and Jefferson College
were "handicapped in their contests

iwith the colleges and universities,

where other members of the fresh-
men classes were permitted to _, be
members of the varsity teams. Seven
members of the present Washington
and Jefferson College football team
are in a crippled condition and may
not be able to pla.y for some weeks.

As the material in the three upper
classes at W. & J. is about exhausted
the members of~the~ athle‘tic,'assiocia-
tion decided to rescind the one-year
resident clause to permit the football
coach and the football committee to
draw players from the freshmen class.
This will give the W. & J. football
coachesan opportunity to develop
players from the freshmen class, as

is done in thevother colleges and uni,-

versities in western Pensylvania.

Dummy is ‘Brought Out to_ Aid

Men in Tackling

With the idea of getting all the
ﬁne points of the game down pat,

Coach Joe Thompson went back to,

the rudiments of the game last week
at Forbes Field and gave the boys
a careful drilling in tackling, block-
ing the ends and similar stunts. Lhe
tackling dummytwas brought out of

temporary retirement and every man
given at a whirl at it. Although the

tackling so far has been pretty good,
the coach. is determined to better it
as the season advances and the time
approaches for the W. and J. and
State games. The later team
noted especially for its great t-acklers
and Thompson is determined that his
boys shan’t be second to them in this
respect on Turkey Day. In the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania-Penn State
game at Philadelphia the Center
county boys are said ‘to have out-
shone their opponents in tackling.
Pitt is making no secret of the fact
that one of its representatives saw
Capt. 'Gray’s men perform against
the Quakers and the report is brought
home tha't their eleven is equally as
strong as it has been in former years.

is

Notwithstanding the fact that V\.'
and‘ I. have been suffering reverses‘

so far, the annual game here between
the two rivals is already starting to
attract at'tention. It is a well known
fact that W. and J. men look forward
to the Pitt game as the all important

struggle of the year and the Washing-G

tonians are sure to put up the best

‘brand of football they know how

when against the locals.
Reports have come from VVashing-
ton that Coach Morrow’s one !3.I11l)l~

tion now is to give Pit any unex-~

pected setback and .it is said" that her-
culean efforts will be taken to getthe

tion of the University News. The
editors are always glad to receive

anything in‘ the way of criticism or

suggestion which will help to im-

prove the publication.

the first banquet of the engineers.

Speechesand songs will be in evi-
dence all evening.

iciation, which is to be held on the
 morning of Thanksgiving

will prove of special interest to col-
lege men in Western Pennsylvania.

The club has decided to offer sev-
cral special prizes to the college men
who compete. The college team which
makes the. best score in the run will
be presented with a banner, while
the individual collegians who do the
best work will be given medals. These
prizes will be awarded regardless of
the individual or team winner of the
race.

A large number of Carnegie Tech
boys are now 'training at hill-and-
dale chasing, and it is hoped that the

a strong team in the race.’ Entries
are also expected from W. and J.,
