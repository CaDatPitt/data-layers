greater than it has been "for several

Several departmental managers have
been unexpectedly successful, ‘their
reports" indicated, »-and the ambition
of thesttaﬁ to obtain ‘a. ~hundred.|‘p?er-
cent subscription from members or;
the Junior class will probably be

“realized. _ V. . V
A concentrated drive among mem- V .

a post card was sent’ -to-each Junior
setting forth the purpose of the drive
and emphasizing the duty of each

port his‘ class book. The card lays-
stress upon. the fact‘ that‘ 1925 Owl
aﬁordts the -only ‘copporttunity ‘for ‘a

Those who were rnot in Pittsburgh
for the‘Christmas Card Party will
probably appreciate a word about its
success. Of course‘ it is too soon for

there were sixty-ﬁve tables in play,
and added-to the number of people
that represents are about twenty-
ﬂve more who dropped in "to see’ who
was there -and to say -“Hello”;V and
any party’, with two» hundned ' and
eighty-ﬁve people attracted to it must
be a success. The committee in
charge worked‘ most eﬂiciently and’
the chairman, Mrs. Margaret Ralston

handled.
mittee in charge of tickets, had an

‘well they seemed to like it.‘ 
Rose Adams ’20, and her conimittee,
