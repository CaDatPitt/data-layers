Annual Smoker to be Held 
A ' Hotel Schenley February 17

 

’Members and friends of the Even-

" ing School, Association will present
the entertainment * at the annual
men’s smoker to be held in the Hotel
Islchenley on Saturlay evening, Feb-
ruary 17. This custom was intro-
- duleed last year and was so ‘well re-
" A ceived: that it is being repeated. Fo-r-
merly, the ‘programs were given by
, professional talent which lacked the
. , personal touch given to the program
5 by ‘fellow~‘memb«e1isana friends. V_
1-The old team of “Artha.h,” James
and‘ “Sambo” ‘Cherry, will be seen in
new. roles- John ‘Arnold, Zareh

.. vorites will,“trip the light fantastic"
 and “render vocal feats of quality

_pantomimes'~and skits. ~Music’by a
.synco'p'ated ‘orchestra, Goa. number of
"novel suprises of which not .the
slightest hint is ‘permissible ‘and
plenty. of smokes will round out the
program as proposed by the Exe-cu-
.tive Committee. A "

’ The annual smokers have always
been very" successful‘ and well attend-
ed, but the association feels conﬁ-
dent that this‘ year's smoker will out-9
shine. all of its ‘predecessors.
, An important feature‘ of ‘these
smokers» is the opportunity afforded
"for the formation of new acquaint-
ances. The students of the Evening
‘School do not have many opportuni-
ties-~t'o. c_ome in contact with — each
other _as do the students of the Day
_ School. Such social events;»as the
 annual smoker are "thus responsible
 for many friendships as well as. good

led ‘the proposed revised constitution

 tion." In the past the nominating sys-
"tem of choosing cand' ates was em-
ployed. Under the revised constitu-
-tion‘ candidates will be chosen by the
‘direct primary method‘. The ‘by-laws
 provide that the names of; all, candi-
 ‘dat'e's.'_for nominations shall be placed
‘ upon the officialprimary ballot upon

At the last. meeting of Athletic
Council -Chairman 'Paul.L. Hay,’ ’95,

of the Committee on. Class Reunions, _

presented a very‘ extensive report
which‘ indicated that’ -a lot of study
had -been devote-dfto the problem by
him and his committee; The list of
classes which would hold reunions
annually was open for discussion, ‘and
there was some division of opinion
as to just‘ what schedule should be
adopted.

Mr. Hay and his scommittee are
making a further study of the prob-
lem and no less than four plans are
now being considered. This subject
will be d'is'c-uss_ed' thoroughly at the
March meeting of Alumni Council
and ﬁnal action taken. After that
the committee -will work hard, to ar-
range the details so that each year
regular scheduled class reunions can
be held at ‘Commencement time.

The general plans _will be to use

as headquarters during Commence-
ment timefor these classes. Return-
ing -classes can attend the Com-
mencement exercises in the morning,
have luncheon at the Faculty Club
and informal reunions during the aft-
ernoon, and then attend the alumni
banquet or whatever function is held
in the evening.

Dean Amos says that every once in
a while she has requests from Alum-

nae as to. entrance requirements to
Oxford University in England, and '
having received a pamphlet on the
same from the A. A. U. W. she for-
warded it to the writer for publica-
tion. Many Alumnae who are consid-
ering post-graduate work will be in-
terested in the substance of the pam- A
phlet which is as follows:

“1. At the request of the Princi-,'
pals of the ﬁve Oxford Women’s So-1'
cieties,‘ that is, Somerville College,
Lady Margaret Hall, St. =Hugh’s Col- 1
lege, St. Hilda’s_; Hall, and the Socie-
ty of Oxford Home-Students, the Com-
mittee.on International Relations of
the American Association of Univer-
Sity Women has arranged to receive,
at its Aoﬂice in New York City, appli.
cations from American women grad-—
uates desiiing to study at Oxford, and ‘
to forward to the Principals at Ox-
ford recommendations regarding these
candidates. This plan ha.s been work.
ed out in cooperation with the Insti-
tue of International Education, whose.‘ -V » 1
oﬂice in New YOTK is‘ the headquar-
ters of the Committee, with the Brit-
ish Federation of University Women, it
with the British Division of the Amer-
ican. University Union, and with the
American Council on Education. Some ‘
such arrangement has been made neca A 
essary by the large number of Ame_r- 9
ican women wishing to enter Oxford,"
the very limited capacity of the~wom-
en’s colleges there, and theidiﬁiculty  _I
of handling applications and creden-
tials from‘ an oflice in England. , _ ’
2. Each year the Principals of the . 
ﬁve Oxford Women’s Societies will
reserve a certain,-number of places
for American women graduate stu-
dents and will‘ﬁ1l these on the basis
of the recommendations of the Amer-
ican Committee. ' \ , .
3. Only women of unusual schol-
arly ability and training, and. of se-
rious purpose, can -expect to be ad-
mitted to Oxford for graduate study‘. 1
In general, only those who have ,a1- .“
readyhad ayear of graduate work in . 
this -country can hope to compete with -
other graduate students" at Oxford.  
The following suggestions have been  -
‘received from the Oxford Principalsgf

could most proﬁtably study there." _
a. Those intending to be in res!-_ xi“

‘served ‘in the world war willbe per-
mitted to "again take up the insurance‘
that they were carrying during the
war.
S. veterans bureau, stated recently
that of more than 4,000,000 men and
women who were granted insurance,
only a small number continued their
premium payments. A __ .
The War risk insurance act provi’ ed
that war risk insurance might be con-
verted to permanent legal reserve in-
surance, within ﬁve years from the
declaration of peace, into any of the
following forms of policies: ordinary
life, 20-payment life, 30 payment life,A.
20-year endowment, 30-year endow-
ment, and endowment maturing at
age 62. A A. « A

These policies all contain such lib-
eral features as 31 days of grace be-
fore the payment of premiums with-
out interest, participation in dividends
earned from gains and savings, loan
paid up and ‘extended insurance val-
ues after the policy has been in force
one year, no restrictions as to resi-
dence, travel, occupation military or
naval service. Upon -the death _of‘ the
holder payment will be made in one

of the insured. _No' additional‘ charge.
is made if the insured engages in haz-
ardous employment, -nor for the total
perma.nenAtVi'disability beneﬁts. Pre-
miums. are charged at net _rates ac-
cording to the'American Experience
Table of Mortality and three and one
half per‘ cent‘ interest, and these L rates,
are lower than those’ charged for any
other participating insurance with
similar beneﬁts. A -. “
Veterans of the World -War who have
permitted their insurance to lapse are
offered the--opportunity to again re-
gain" this valuable protection‘ at a very
“small. outlay of money. If the veter-
an is in good health, it is only neces-
saryifor him -toypay two monthly pre-
.miAu_ms,on theamount of term insur-
--ance he reinstates. Inltaking up the
insurance again, reinstatement is per-
mitted in amounts of 31,000 up» -to the
whole amount carried during service.
If the -applicant's health has been im-
paired, because of a disability or sick-
ness incurred while in active mili-
tary ‘or naval service, his insurance‘
may be reinstated by simplypaying
the premiums in arrears. with inter-
est, provided he is not -permanently
disabled. .  p I ‘ ,

TO. THE ‘FRESHMEN

a You students who are just entering
the university for the ﬁrst time think,
that you have at‘ last attained the’
zenith of your career. Little do you
think that it is a mere stepping stone
or just another rung in the ladder
which you are climbing to gain those
heights sublime. While, I do not wish
to shatter your air castle I only wish
to present you with.some facts which
may help you during your stay among
us.

In the ﬁrst place you will be in-
terested in knowing that you have
come to at school which is gradually
growing in prestige with the other
large schools of the East, and also it
is ‘gaining more power among the
athletes of , the other colleges and
Universities of the country. You
probably know already that the Uni-

c'ampaign in a few years. This will
give you better facilities in which to
prepare you for your ‘life work. When
you get-to know the faculty and your
class mates you will be glad that

versity of Pittsburgh. ' _

To have absolute success in your
college career there" are a-few essen-
tial points to be observed. The chief
and most important being to always
obey_ your upper classmates. Observe.
the “Freshman rules” very closely and
no harm will come to you but a slight
variation will bring you much sor-
row._. Besides your classmates, the
instructors should be obeyed. I have.
found it proﬁtable during my stay
here to do everything they request,-
most of them will not require the
impossifble. They will give you ‘the
beneﬁt of the doubt at all times if
they see that you are earnest in your
endeavor, and conscientious in your
effort. "Some study will be necessary -
to prove to them that you are trying-
to learn your work. —
One of the most successful ways to
get through college is to decide at
the start that you are going to make
good. Anqeasy-way is to make the
acquaintance of Mr. Percy Vere. » He '
is the friend of the faithful student,
the man or woman who wants to get

the most out of his classes. He does
not like slackers. Do not be con-
tent to just pass a, subject. The time

has come now that a man who has
the highest grades in his subjects gets
the best jobs. Sometimes he happens
to be the one who is not as well pre-
pared as the mediocre student but
his marks are the deciding factor.
Another advantage in obtaining high
grades is the assurance of‘ gradu-
ation at the end__of four years, time.
If any deﬁciencies arise "during the
four years they remain unnoticed’ un-
til _the time for graduation andiit will
be too" late. So I warn you to be on
the look out for such “heart break-
ers.” ‘ 

.Now I appreciate the fact that “all
work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy” so I advise those of you who
are athletically inclined to take part
in the sporting life of the college.
If you think that you have even only
an iota of talent, develop it. Every-
body is given a chance to prove what
they can do for Pitt. If you can
make a noise that sounds like "sing-
ing join the ‘Gleeclu-bs. There is a
club for the girls too. If you think
you can act or imitate some one, join
the Pitt Players and if you think you
can argue the Debators will welcome
you. The other activities are foot-
ball (women exempted) and basket-
ball and baseball. If you cannot play
any _of these games your presence is

home. Some of you may be able to
write stories, make up jokes, in siich
cases the Pitt Panther and the Pitt
_Weekly will take care. of you. _ -
Finally remember that the Uni-

The ﬁrst in the series of artist re-
citals under the auspices of the Pitts-'
burgh Musical Institute will be given
at ‘Carnegie Music Hall on Friday
evening," February 16, by Ernest
Hutcheson, the eminent pianist. Born
in Melbourne,» Australia, he ﬁrst be-
came known as a prodigy, and at the
age of ‘ﬁve made an extensive tour
of Australia. His teacher at that
time was Max Vogrich. 'A few years
later he went to Germany, where he
studied under Zwintsclier, VReinecke
and’ Jadassehn at the Leipzig Con-
servatory and under Stavenhagen in
Weimar. During the years follow}-
ing he lived, ‘in comparative retire-
ment, sometimes ‘win Europe, «some-
times in this country——teaching, play-
ing occasionally, but principally con-
tinuing to study, never satisﬁed‘ al-
ways striving I after higher ideals.
Hutcheson has made «extensive tours
of Australia, England, Germany, Rus-
sia and the United States, where‘ he
has repeatedly appeared as soloist
with all the important Symphony or-
chestras.’ One of the -very greatest
of living pianists, he has won tri-
umphs that insure his name a lasting
place in musical history. ‘His ﬁne
programs devoted to Bach, Beethoven,
Schuniann, Chopin and Liszt, given.
earlier this season in New York, Ros-V
ton, Toronto, and other cities, have
been sensationally popular. The pro-
gram for Mr. Hutcheson’s Pittsburgh
appearance February 16 is as follows:
Four Inventions . ................ ...._ ..... ..Bach

me As j AN 1- . ERC_0L- ;
- LEGIATE SPORT  ’

By William R. Biggs,
Manager Yale University Riﬂe Team.
1920-1922. . Member the Executive
Board and Publicity‘ Manager. the
Intercollegiate Association of ‘Aﬂ"ili-
ated Riﬂe -Clubs, 1921-1922. A

The great war ., brought many
changes inthe colleges of the‘United
States, yet perhaps, “none of them
have been as striking as the sudden
growth '»in'.~"interest in riﬂe shooting
as a regularly gconstituted " ‘college
sport. This is duezto a wide variety
of causes». The chief reason seems
to be thatduring the war many Amer-
icans who had never.even seen a riﬂe
before were forced to become famil-
iar with it. ‘What is more, they were
dependent on their riﬂe and the skill
with ‘which -they used it for their very
lives and many of them learned to
love their riﬂes. .At the end of the
war they did not wish‘ to give up their
newly acquired a-rt: altogether and
welcomed the chance to practice it
at colleges._ _ ‘V
Then, too, there came to many peo-
ple all over the country the rea'l_iz,a-
tion that the best safeguard against
war is reasonable preparation _in
peace. There could be no better prep-
aration than a general knowledge of
shooting among the college men of
the day.

Men who have used‘ a riﬂe or shot
to any great extent can testify to

-the great charm of the sport and thus

the warby bringing more men into
contactwith the riﬂe taught them and
made them feel its fascination.

Yet there is one factor which we
must recognizehad a large part in
the growth of riﬂe shooting at the
colleges. This is the novelty of the
sport. At Yale when we first started
our telegraphic matches there‘ was an
immense amount‘ of interest because
of the newness of the idea. Small
bore shooting, -and that is what I am

ercise and so -the sport must appeal
more for its own sake. The manage-
ment’ of a riﬂe team more than per-

. haps any other must keep wide awake

and constantly promote its sport, and
try to institute new and interesting
features continually. Because of the
telegraphic feature of the matches
one ofthe great incentives to going
out for a ‘sport is taken away and
this must .be counteracted. The fea-
ture. to which I refer is the taking
of -trips which is one of the most
important factors in getting’ men to
come out for the minor college ‘sports.
Every manager should. do his best to
get his athletic association to ﬁnance
one tripga year if possible. Arrange-

college to shoot alternately on each
other’s home‘ range or some neutral
range upon certain prescribed condi-
tions. This would do more than any-
thing to keep interest in the sport

. alive-Land to get the best men out.

Another factor which helps keep

ﬁinterest up is the constant addition
I , of new features in the way of shoot-
_ . ing and in the schedule.
1 4521 Forbes Street, Near Craig 'St.§ '

two years Yale has shot an annual
match with ‘Oxford University ‘and

uate public and the sympathetic sup-
-port and co-operation -of the athletic

’ association. Last. year a new feature
_ was added_‘to' these matches in -the.
’ addition of, a two-stage match, one-

stage the regular prone slow ﬁre and
the other prone rapid fire.

The Yale, team made a perfect score
in the rapid ﬁre -stage. The new
rapid ﬁre stage aroused keen interest
among the members of the squad and
there was a greatdeal of rivalry in
the tryouts for the team to shoot
_ Oxford. f Intersectional
matches are also great -stimulants. to
interest ; I .

ments could’ be made with another,

For the last‘

this has done more than anything to
arouse the interest of the undergrad-_

‘ This stage,
‘was suggested by"Oxford» and was
shot on targets furnished ’ by themﬁ
Yale furnished the‘ slow ﬁre"-targets.’

that‘ is the; oificia ‘ ecognition. ‘of the

 sport by the‘f;_Unive‘rsity_A_thletic As-

sociations ’ and the " awarding 7of the
insignia to members of theteam; I
have had so -many letters asking for
the basis on which we are awarded
letters by our athletic’ association that

‘ I’ shall try to clearthet matter up

here. . It had been till iast year the
management’s policy to_ award ‘the
rYt'to all ‘men placing inthe Harvard,
Princeton or Oxford matches, but
there were obvious injustices in this
method, and last year we recommend-
ed_ for insignia the ten men with‘ the
highest’ -averages in theomatches all
during the season. This method will,
I think, _be found the fairest.‘ Last
year, in addition to the‘ ten r,Y-t in-
signias the athletic association ‘recog-
nized our very good record in the
prone shooting by awarding the ﬁve
highest men on the team their class
numerals in, addition _to_ the rYt., , We.
are of course given a regular budget
and are a fully constituted minor
sport. The athletic association has
been most sympathetic‘ and helpful,

could have done more.” Personally I
am very strongly opposed to the con-
trol of the riﬂe team by the R. 0. T.

association ‘uninterested and limits

the R. O. T.‘ C.’ Co—operatio~n with
the R. 0. T. -C. is both necessary and
beneﬁcial to both. At Yale this or-
ganization has done a very ‘great deal
for us and only through the aid of
its officers and commander has the
existence and ‘development of the
sport been porssible. The ideal ar-

letic as-sociation -and co-operation with

gest to any manager who wishes to
make use of the assistance in pub-

kind is most desirable in promoting
the sport. The undergraduate body
cannot be expected to show‘ interest
unless the matches are written upin
the college paper and other papers‘. -

For the future I think the greatest
hope of development of indoor shoot-
ing lies in the standardization of con-
ditions, the development of the oif-
hand, sitting, and kneeling’position’s

to obtain greater variety; and the

recognition more fully by the War
Department of the immense value of
Intercollegiate shooting in the prep-
aration of the nation_ by sending each
year a certain number’ ‘of recognized

‘ Defeats Panthers, 38-31

Nittany Lions Down Pitt
‘in Trees Gym.—-— Game is

P _ I Well Played

 

The Panther basketball_ers were

‘again defeated last Friday evening

when the Penn State quintet took
them over in Trees Gym, 38-31. Thls
‘made the second consecutive defeat
for the Blue and" Gold after they had
won six straight victories.
fouls committed by Coach Carlson’s

lads caused their downfall. Because

of the consistent foul shooting of
Reed, the score was in favor of the

"Nittany boys, when the ﬁnal whistle

blew. '
There was a record crowd on hand

. to witness the contest and, owing to
the small

seating facilities, there
were many people turned away. Many
and followers were
present to see the annual duel be-
tween the Center Countians and Pitt.

~Penn State opened the scoring for

,their side by having Reed drop in a

foul, and Shair cage a neat ﬁeld goal.
Hymie Levinson gave the ﬁrst two
points for Pitt, and after that the
battle was on. At the end of the
ﬁrst half, the Panthers were holding
a 23-19 lead. .

In the second half, the Penn State

ﬁve came back with loads of vigor in
their attack. Pitt only had three ﬁeld

goals in the last period, while Penn
State had ﬁve. State increased her

‘lead by the foul goals registered by

Reed. In the opening of the half,
Pitt held the lead for a -short while,
butthe visitors came back and took

the lead which they held until the

end of the contest.
This second defeat may be blamed
on the rough tactics used by the Pan-

‘ I ‘ there, which forced the oﬁicials to call

many fouls on them. The good sup-
port that Reed gave his teammates
in caging 20 out of 25 fouls also help-
ed to defeat Pitt. The Nittany boys
smooth machine and
showed a better and cleaner defense
than Pitt. Jordan, Captain Byers and

Levenson were the stars for the 10-
"cals, and Reed, Loeffler and Captain
Koehler shone for the Lions.

PITT SWIMMERS

 The swimmers of the University
of Pittsburg'h_gave the Annapolis
Midshipmen one of -the stiifest bat-
tles they have ever encountered this
season when the Middies barely won
by 31 to 28 points, this despite the
fact that -the Panthers garnered ﬁrst
place in four out of the seven events.

The teams were locked in a tie at
25 points all when the ﬁnal event, the
100-yard dash, was reached. And the
race was so close that it was diffi-
cult for the judges to decide. Buck,
of Navy, was declared victor over
Corr, Pittsburgh, but it was only a
matter of inches. The two hung close
together all the way, while Sinclair,
Navy, .who ‘had only a few minutes
before pulled his team up in the scor-
ing by taking the 220-yard swim, ﬁn-
ished third in the deciding event.

Navy won the 160-yard relay, but
when Steel and Corr ﬁnished ﬁrst and
third in the 50-yard dash, respective-
ly,‘and Clark won the distence plunge
the Panthers pulled up within a few
points. - '

Sinclair, a Washington, D. «C., lad,
who is Navy’s crack distance swim-
mer, won easily in the 220, but it was
evident that he spent himself too.
much in this event .to come back suf-
ﬁciently to take the 100 yards.

The distance plunge by Clark, was
noteworthy, in that he covered the
60 yards in 23 seconds, a new uni-
versity record.

STATE FBESHMEN‘

The rejuvenated Freshman team

swept through two opponents in fine ~

fashion last week. The ﬁrst to fall
was Braddock High School. Then on
last night the Freshmen swept their
old timefoes off their feet when they
tore through the State Freshmen for
a 50-32 victory. Ever since the
Freshmen ﬁrst reported for practice
at Thanksgiving they had been point-
ed for the State game.

Every State point was garnered
from a long distance shot, due to the
close guarding of the Freshmen. The
defense of the Pitt Yearlings was
good. Time after time State would
not get any more than a quarter of
a length of the iﬂoor before a Pitt
man would break through and inter-
cept a pass and dribble toward the
Pitt goal unmolested.

Thoreson was the leader of the
attack and scored nine ﬁeld goals
against State and ten against Brad-
dock. The giant Pitt center, Chase,
gave a wonderful account of himself.
He was the keystone man of the "de-
fense and always forced his man to
hurry the pass.

Hawkins kept up hisend of the
battle at the other forward and con--
tributed nobly with his ﬁne work. The
few ﬁeld goals that State scored were
counted from the center of the floor,
due to the close guarding of Jones and

James. Very few got near the bas-
ket to shoot. Lineup:
