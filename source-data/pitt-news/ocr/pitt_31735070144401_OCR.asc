Three years removed from their
last Super Bowl run, the Pittsburgh
Steelers are looking for one for the
other thumb.

Pittsbu.tgh’s NFL franchise outlast-
ed the Baltimore Ravens 23-14 in the
AFC Championship Game at Heinz
Field on Sunday to lift the Steelers to
their seventh Super Bowl appearance,
coming Feb. 1 in Tampa, Fla

If Oakland’s reaction to the Steel-
ers’ Sunday Victory is any indication,
Pitt’s campus could overﬂow with a
seemingly endless army of students
 into the streets after an im-
 Super Bowl win

“It was crazy,” said Pitt junior

Justin Terek. “The whole street was

A The Daiily

Pt's Steele

packed, there was a couple of Philly
fans hanging out of [a window] wav-
ing an Eagles ﬂag, and the crowd
ripped it down.” 1

Several hundred students mobbed

together Sunday night in a celebratory

manner following Pittsburglfs win.
The sea of black and gold consisted
of Terrible Towels  and con-
stant cheering and 

Sunday’s scene was reminiscent of
a much larger riot that occurred after
the Steelers defeated the Seattle Sea-
hawks in Super Bowl XL

In that incident, thousands of Pitt
students crowded onto Forbes Av-
enue and Bigelow Boulevard as police
closed the road to drivers Excited

ing and caused damage to-numerous

Sophomore Corey Dietz, who at-
tended the Super  vic-
tory, was practically speechless about
his expeiience

“It was awesome,” said Dietz.
‘Most incredible experience I’ve
probably ever had, to be honest.”

Dietz said he goes to one or two
Steelers games per season, but that
this contestwas the first playoff game
he’s attended.

Both Terek and Dietz said it was
too early to finalize their plans for
the Super Bowl, but that they expect
many opportunities to arise both on
and off campus.

The Steelers’ Super Bowl XLI[[

P feing sue

opponent is the historically inept Ari-
zona Cardinals Since the Super Bowl’s
inception in 1967, the Cardinals never
reached the season’s ﬁnal game until
 a berth in this years game
with a 32-25 triumph over the Phila-
delphia Eagles Sunday afternoon.

Arizona features two former Pitt
standouts, wide receiver Larry Fitzger-
ald and linebacker Gerald Hayes
Fitzgerald, the former Heisman Tro-
phy runner-up as a sophomore with
the Panthers in 2003, already has set
the NFL playoff record for most re-
ceiving yards‘ in one postseason with
419. 1

Despite Fitzgerald’s presence and ,

the two—week layoff, some Pitt stu-
dents and Steelers fans already have
a prediction in mind for Super Bowl

   

  

XLIH.

“Arizona almost looks like [Pitts-
burgh] the last time they won the Su-
per Bowl,” said Terek. ‘Tm worried
about them, but I still think the Steel-
ers will win.’ ’

Ultimately, Dietz agreed

“I just don’t think the Cardinals
can  the Steelers,” said Dietz.
“The Steelers defense will hold out”

On Sunday, the Steelers never
trailed against the Ravens, but a fourth
quarter touchdown run by Willis Mc-
Gahee cut Pittsburgh’s lead to 16-14.

Baltimore had the ball and a
chance to take the lead, but Steelers
safety Troy Polamalu intercepted for-
mer Pitt quarterback Joe Flacco and
returned it for a touchdown, cement-
ing the ﬁnal score

Market Central was evacuated
around Sunday’s brunch hour

ﬂooded most of the area.

As ﬁre alarms resonated
throughout the ﬂoor, Market
Central staff and additional Uni-

to combat the water, which ap-
peared to be ﬂooding from a

leading from the~Towers lobby to

Hillel

  hosts  

consul  

by Becky Reiser
Staﬁ’ Writer

Regarding the conflict in
Gaza, the Israeli Consul General
to the Mid—Atlantic United States
has three things to say to college
students.

“There was no alternative;
Israelis entered into this with a
heavy heart. Second, the objec-
tive was to bring peace to Israel,”
said Daniel Kutner, Monday dur-
ing a talk at Hillel, the Jewish
University Center of Pittsburgh.

The third point he tried to get
across to the audience was that
“the enemies are Hamas, not Pal-
estinians in the Gaza strip.”

Kutner spoke to a group of
college students who hailed pri-
marily from Carnegie Mellon
University and Pitt about the situ-
ation in the Middle East, as well
as the reasons behind Israel’s at-
tack on Gaza and its current cry
for peace.

Kutner said the majority of
students aren’t educated about
the situation in Gaza.

“Its an uphill task to show
the context of why [the attacks]
happened; to show that Hamas
is taking ﬁghting to the heart of

‘over the alarms-to one another as
they attempted to quell the tor-
rent.

“This is crazy. This is crazy,”
yelled one staff member repeat-
edly.

The water, which appeared
deepest by the cashiers’ area and
the Flying S-T—A—R Diner, ﬂowed
past the Basic Kneads and Magel-
lan’s dining stations. I

Simultaneously, the ﬂood ad-
vanced into the Quick Zone and

the dining area‘ past Taco Bell.
Blocked by an understated
“Caution: Wet ﬂoor” warning,
students in the Towers lobby
crowded -at the top of the stair-
well to witness the hullabaloo.

“That’s a lot of water. This is A

great,” said Pitt student Jen Mc-
Naboe. “I think it’s funny.”

“The staircase looks like a
dock in the ocean,” said Pitt stu-
dent Peter M.iller.

A security guard tried to keep

the gaggle of students from get-
ting too close to the chaos.

“Keep it moving. There’s
nothing to see here, except the
water,” he yelled.

This is the second plumbing is-
sue of the weekend for Pitt, after
Nordy’s Place in the Union also
experienced some water damage. ’

Pitt officials on the scene
could not immediately comment,
as they were assisting with the
cleanup.

feed the

homeless

by Kay Oyegun
Stzzﬁ” Wrz'ter

\X/hilemany people in Oak-
land are finding reasons to stay
in on these frigid winter days,
Diana Pasco and the First Trinity
Homeless Ministry have found a
reason to stay out.

The 15 degree wind chill was
no match for the four First Trin-
ity volunteers Sunday afternoon.
Pounding through slush and piles
of snow, the group walked up
and down Forbes and Fifth av-
enues, searching in alleys, look-
ing through windows and asking
security guards if there was any-
one who needed a place to stay or
something to eat.

Every Sunday since Sept. 14,
Pasco, a CMU senior, and her
group of Volunteers have pre-
pared bagged lunches, -put to-
gether care_ packages and visited
several homeless people in Oak-
land.

“The” goal of the organiza-
tion is to provide support for
the homeless,” said Pasco. “The
[homeless] too often get passed
by.”

Support comes in the form
of bagged peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches, turkey sandwiches,
a piece of fruit and a bottle of

water. The care packages include books,
hand sanitizer and toothpaste in addition to
hats, gloves and blankets during the winter.

After working with Hot Metal Bridge
Church’s homeless ministry in Southside,
Pasco decided to start a similar program
in the First Trinity Church. With the sup-
port of Pastor Douglas Spittel, First Trin-
ity Homeless Ministry became one of the
church’s many outreach programs along
with the International Student Ministry, Lu-
theran Student Fellowship and Pittsburgh
Lutheran Center for the Blind.

“Diana and her people are the workers,”
said Spittel. “The parish is simply here pro-
viding support.”

There are five active members of the
First Trinity Homeless Ministry, but volun-
teers from non-proﬁt Pittsburgh Cares also
get involved. Two volunteers, Rich Lynch
and Angela Hadbavny, members of the
Pittsburgh Lutheran Center for the Blind,
help make the sandwiches. They said they

feel rewarded for being able to give back.

“We want to show [the homeless] they
are worthy of respect and kindness,” said
Hadbavny, who isalso an adjunct instructor
at Duquesne University’s pharmacy school.
“We want to show them they are valuable in
our eyes and in God’s eyes.” » V,

Although the group began in the fall, its
program has changed several times.

In the warmer ‘months, Pasco andgher
group could find and feed ﬁve to eight
people.

According to Pasco’_s records, they had
served 21 individuals by Nov. 14. Now they
are lucky to ﬁnd just one.

“I do get a little disappointed when we
don’t see anyone,” said Pasco, “but I hope
it is because they have found somewhere
warm to stay for the time being.”

Pasco and her group refuse to give up.

“We will go every week,” said Tamara
Liburd, a Chatham graduate student. “They
need to know we won’t stop.” T

Obama continues to give message of hope at celebration

Inauguration, page 1
estimated 300,000 people’ could watch

and hear. It all seemed like just a teaser ~

for the predicted crowds at today’s inau-
guration.

The. program began with Bruce
Springsteen, dressed in black with only
an acoustic guitar, singing a haunting
rendition of “The Rising” backed by a
fullchorus. Passionate and gravel-voiced
as ever, The Boss set the tone for the af-
ternoon of inspired speeches and perfor-
mances.

Celebrity speeches were interspersed
in the day’s performances and, as the day
was a celebration of past triumphs and
present victories, many quoted famous
Americans, with presidents John F. Ken-
nedy, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin
Roosevelt showing up most often. ‘

The allusions sent a clear message —
to build hope for the future, links must
be made to the successful past.

“I won’t pretend that meeting any of
these challenges will be easy,” said Obama
after listing America’s current ills.

“It‘ll take more than a month, more
than a year. It’ll likely take many. All the
way there will be setbacks and false starts,
days that test our resolve as a nation. But,
despite the enormity of the task that lies

 

ahead, I stand here today as hopeful as.
ever that the United States of America
will endure, that the dream of "our fathers

will live on in our time.
He paused.
“What gives me the greatest hope of

all is not the stone and marble that sur-

round us, but what fills the spaces in be-
tween. It is you.”

Kutner also spoke about the recent
agreement to “declare the end of hostilities
and withdraw from the strip.’A’

“I’m not sure we destroyed the Hamas
world view, but their capabilities were de-
stroyed,” said Kutner about the effective-
ness of the attacks.

The talk followed a meeting held on
Hillel last W/ednesday, where student lead-
ers in the Jewish community at CMU and
Pitt spoke about their stance on the conﬂict
and how to respond to the protests for‘Pal-
estine supporters.

“It started as a discussion,” said Carly
Adelmann, president of Hillel at Pitt. “Stu-
dents were unsure how they were feeling
themselves, they all had different perspec-
lives, some students were rallying, and oth-
ers weren’t.”

Aaron Weﬂ, executive director of Hillel,
said the discussion provided “the context
students needed to converse about a wider,
global issue.”

Although there have been loud protests
on both sides of the conﬂict, “Students _for
Justice in Palestine and Hillel have much
more that unites them rather than divides
them,” said \X/eil.

Challenging the census
would be good for Pittsburgh

It’s no surprise that Pittsburgh’s
population is decreasing. City ofﬁ—
cials have pondered how to keep
young people in the city for years,
how to build the job market in the
area and how to attract people to
the Downtown region that is his-
torically low on tourists and per-
manent residents.

When the news hit last week
that Toledo, Ohio, had surpassed
Pittsburgh in population according
to a recent census, it shouldn’t have
come as a huge shock. Instead, it
has galvanized the city leaders to
ﬁnd out exactly how many people
live in Pittsburgh and why the cityfs
population keeps slipping.

Toledo overtook Pittsburgh af-
ter challenging the results of a U.S.
Census Bureau estimate, which
originally put Toledo’s population
at 295,029 last July. After the chal-
lenge, a recent census put the total
at 316,851, an increase of about 6
percent. Pittsburgh’s population is
estimated to be 311,218.

In most respects, a recount
seems like a good idea. Having an
accurate census allows Pittsburgh
to receive all the federal funding it
deserves, some of which is based
on population ﬁgures.

MayorLuke Ravenstahl said that
there is at least anecdotal evidence
that Pittsburgh’s population bleed

might be slowing or stopping. He
J cited ﬁgures such as increased en-

rollment in magnet schools, which
might be related to the Pittsburgh
Promise program, an aid program
run by the Pittsburgh Foundation
to help graduates from city schools
with college tuition.

The city must also consider
the role of college students, who
comprise a large segment of Pitts-

burgh’s population. Although col-'

lege students might not be perma-

nent residents, they still count on
census information in terms of
occupancy, as well as mail and vot-
er registration. City Controller Mi-
chael Lamb said counting college
students “could have a big impact’ ’
on the population of the city.
However, Ravenstahl and Al-
legheny County Chief Executive
Dan Onorato are also using this
as an opportunity to push for the
city—county merger project, after a
fact-ﬁnding study between them-
selves and Pitt Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg was completed in
April of last year. The merger is
under legislation in Harrisburg.
Ravenstahl said in an interview
with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
that the city’s population would
jump much further from a merg-
er with Allegheny County than it
would from a census reevaluation.
Most census challenges yield about
a 2 percent population increase,
whereas a merger with Allegh-

‘ eny County could result in a jump

of more than 300 percent. This
would certainly affect the amount
of aid and federal funding the city
receives. _

However, boosting the popu-
lation of the city shouldn’t be the
main reason to undertake such a
drastic move. There are other ben-
eﬁts to a city—county merger, but it
shouldn’t simply be for the reason
of getting back at Toledo or inﬂat-
ing population ﬁgures.

Pittsburgh’s officials should
deﬁnitely challenge the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau on its estimates, but

they should carefully consider any

larger moves, like consolidation,
before acting for the wrong rea-
sons. Having more people in the
city could be helpful, but it might
not be enough to outweigh the

Tuesdays with Molly

 
    

by Molly Green
Colum/ziut

It’s Darwin’s law that if an animal

.Wants to survive, it must adapt to its

natural habitat To thrive in the Pitts-
burgh environment, for example, one
must develop a taste for pierogies, a
sizable collection of umbrellas and
a distaste for Ohio — note: I have
heard Ohioans refer to Pittsburgh as
Ohio’s toilet seat.

However, every few years or so,
the Pittsburgh environment changes,
or rather, intensiﬁes. I am referring to,
of course, the status of the cityfs foot-
ball team, the Pittsburgh Smelers V

When the Steelers reach the play-
offs — or sanity forbid, the Super
Bowl —  about the city
changes. Half-naked—all-painted men
roam the streets, absurd  rule
the radio waves, and, perhaps most
 various social taboos change

While once the norm, suddenly it
is no longer socially acceptable to asso-
ciate with certain cities, colors or even
names (see: Mayor Luke Wouldn’ —
pay—the—$108—fee-to-actually—become—
Steelerstahl).

Yet, as nature would have it, evo-
lution leaves some Pittsburghers be-
hind For whatever reason, some poor
schmucks just didn’t get the Steelers
gene. Like a brown burmy tragically
born to an arctic climate, these people
must struggle every day to survive

Many face social banishment, fam-
ily disownrnent or existentialist crises,
 themselves, “Why can’t I just be
like everyone else?” Others, desperate
for the plentiful smorgasbord of food
and toasty climate common at Steel-
ers fans’ gatherings, are forced to look
ir1 from the outside, left to munch on
stale, day-old pasta, cold and alone

Unable to adapt to their new
black-and-gold climate, these sad
souls are ultimately posed  this
dilemma: become a Steelers fan some
way, somehow, or face the wrath of
Pittsburgh (see; Sienna Miller) and
probably even death.

For those with enough  how-
ever, there is a third option. It is 
however. So much so, I probably
shouldn’t even be  about it
This third option involves 
the Steelers fan population, donning

Fair-Weather fans free to be fakers

speakingits language,yetallthewhile,
retaining one’s non—Steelers fan iden-
ﬁt)’-

I speak, of course, of fair-weather
fans, a group that faces more dis-
crimination and hate mongering than
probably any other group in the entire
world. .

Many “die-hard” Steelers fans ma-
liciously attack the fair-weather fans
population,  out nasty politi-
cally incorrect slurs like “poserz” and
laughing at their pink secondhand Je-
rome Bettis  (‘ ‘They don’t even
know he retired,” chide the Steelers
fans).

 

For whatever reason,
some poor schmucks
just didn't get the Steel-
ers gene. Like a brown
bunny tragically born to
an arctic climate, these
people must struggle

every day to survive. ’

Yet if done carefully and correctly,
a fair-weather fan can pull off quite
the convincing subterﬁtge, guarantee-
ing himself every wish he could ever
dream of

I, for example, am a master of all
 clandestine, and last weekend, I
was on the very top of my game

In celebration of the Steelers vs
Baltimore Ravens playoff game, my
extended family  a little get-
together, a soiree, if you will Slowly
the secretive details of this event trick-

‘led in: My sources delivered word of

prospective cupcakes  chips
dip and ﬁnally, best of all, an entire
wheel of cheese

Immediately I knew that I had to
be there.

And so my preparations began

To fool a room of Steelers fans,

the fair-weather fan must look the

part This means dressing in black
and gold, head to foot, including face
paint—-—-trustme, facepaintcanbe
one of those make-it—or-break-it kinds
of 

If you_have enough time, it’s rec-
ommended that the fair-weather fan

go to his local grocery store and buy
a Steelers T-shirt, baseball hat or other
apparel, though he must be particu-
larly careﬁil not to be seen.

I ﬁnd that the trick is most suc-
cessful when you send some sort of
lackey, in this case my mother, in your
place to obtain it Thus, from the hid-
den safety of my house, I can continue
to plot the details of my deception.

But  the part is not enough
— far from it, actually. To truly dupe
a Steelers fan (they are a naturally sus-
picious bunch, prone to bold accusa-
tions like, “I bet you’re just here for
the food!”), one must gather a surface-
level base of knowledge about foot-
ball As depressing as this sounds, it’s
almost absolutely necessary.

Thus, with a quick Google search,
I would accumulate the necessary de-
tails so that later, when my sister asked,
“Who is favored to win this game?”
I could answer in a suave, conﬁdent
voice, “Well, the Steelers have beaten

the Ravens twice before Of course, I

can be quite a challenging feat” Next,
I would probably ﬂip my hair, just so
she was certain just how nonchalant I
was about the whole 

It’s also important to know some
obscure details, as well, just ir1 case a
particularly suspicious Steelers fan is
on to you.

“Did you know that the Arizona
Cardinals used to be based out of
Chicago?” I would ask casually to the
black—and-gold-ﬁlled room. The Steel-
ers fans would then murmur their ap-
proval as I smiled, cool and composed
on the outside, though inside chuck-
ling at my own 

Of course it’s natural that every

you a question to which you just don’t

a smart fair-weather fan will stuff his

‘The Seafarer’ is a card game to remember

Every Christmas gathering may
include an unwanted guest or two.
For most families this is probably
an embarrassing cousin or nagging
grandparent. For the Harkin family,
it’s the devil himself. And Lucifer
cannot be placated with eggnog. He
wants souls.

“The Seafarer” tells the story of
recovering alcoholic James “Shar-
key” Harl<in’s return home to care
for his blind, hard—dtinl<ing brother

Richard Harkin over the holidays. ,

The brothers, played in City The-
atre’s production by Christopher
Donahue and Noble Shropshire re-
spectively, are celebrating Christmas
Eve with a spi1its—fueled poker game
with friends when they are joined by
a mystenous stranger who raises the
stakes far higher than the Harkins
intended.

“There’s a real element of the-
atricality. I always look at a play for
something that makes it need to be a
play, as opposed to some other me-
dium like a novel or a ﬁlm. ‘The Sea-
farer’ is very theatncal. It’s just kind
of riveting,” said Tracy Biigden, the
artistic director of City Theatre.

“It’s always kind of hard to artic-
ulate what viscerally drives you to a
play. What’s usually most important
for me is a really juicy story, which

“The Seafarer” absolutely has. It fol-
lows a really great tradition of Irish
storytelling, just a great yarn,” said
Brigden about her choice of the
production.

The play takes place in Baldoyle, a
coastal suburb of playwright Conor
McPherson’s hometown, Dublin,
Ireland. The play is steeped in tradi-
tional Irish vernacular, posing some
challenges in understandability for

an American audience.

“There are all these unique turns
of phrase and malapropisms. The
actors all have Irish brogues, but
hopefully not so thick that nobody
understands what theyfre saying,”
said Brigden.

In both place and time, the plays
setting seems to have little relation
to Pittsburgh  but Brigden
feels that at its heart "The Seafarer”

is not a Christmas play and could be
appropriate for any season or loca-
tion.

“I think it’s a pretty universal play.
Not just in that there are these issues
of brothers and family everywhere,
but in the more profound aspects,”
said Brigden. “What is hell? What is
heaven? Is redemption possible?”

Philosophical questions for pon-
dering year—round.

 

Watching a card game you aren’t
playing can be boring, and a card
game on stage even more so. Get-
ting the suspense of the high stakes
game to come across to the audi-
ence was not without difﬁculties.

“For the actors it’s a little like
walking and chewing gum at the
same time. Obviously they have to
know all the dialogue, lots of poker
related lines that have to be in

For more than 10 years, I-IBO’s
famous marketing slogan has been
“It’s not TV It’s HBO.” The only
problem is that now it is TV —
in fact, TV is the only good thing
about the Home Box Office, and

I is

 

the term “movie channel” is out-
dated almost to the point of being
oxymoronic. .

It used to be worth something,
having access to premium movie
channels like Starz, Cinemax or
the stalwart HBO. Before the In-
ternet, before OnDemand, hell,
before DVD, it was the best op-
tion for catching a movie without
leaving the house —- even though
you couldn’t choose what movie to

watch or when it started.

Now when you can rent a
new release and download it to
your cell phone, the concept of a
movie channel is almost puzzling
In the next 11 days, HBO is show-
ing “ uno” — which came out on
DVD more than nine months ago
— 12 times. That isn’t including the
showings on HBO Latino.

Count that among the other
high profile titles listed on the HBO

‘Web site, like “The Golden Com-

pass” (on DVD for nine months)
and “I Am Legend” (10 months).
Padding out the big-name features?
Movies you’d long-forgotten? even
existed, like "Unaccompanied Mi-
nors” and “Because I Said So.”
These are cinematic hot dogs
— cheap, fatty ﬁller that you choke
down because it’s the only 
they’re serving at the ballpark. Un-
like HBO, though, a hot dog costs

less than a subscription to Netﬂix.
It must be hard for HBO, or
any other movie channel, to watch
its purpose slip away into obso-
lescence. The best  about a
modern movie channel isn’t even
the movies ,— it’s the original
programming. Even if shows like
“Entourage” -and “Flight of the
Conchords” can’t muster the rat-
ings of predecessors like “The S0-

‘Revolutionary Road' is

anything but a sinking ship

by Noah Levinson
Staﬂ W//‘ital’

Revolutionary Road

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet
Directed by Sam Mendes
Studio: Paramount Vantage

Despite what skeptics
might say, “Revolu—
tionary Road” is not
“Titanic 2.” The pair-
ing of Kate Winslet and
Leonardo DiCaprio isn’t
just Rose sharing the door
with Jack, the ship actually making it to New

 

' York and the story of what happens next.

“Revolutionary Road” is a dramatic mas-
terpiece that drives thoughts of icebergs and
the Heart of the Ocean far from moviegoers’
minds.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio
star as depressed, bored, suburban wife and
husband April and Frank Wheeler. After one
glance from across the room at a party in
New York City, April and Frank are shown
many years later, already married with two
kids and unhappy.

After this unhappiness is firmly estab-
lished in the Wheeler household on Frank’s
40th birthday, April proposes moving the en-
tire family to Paris to start anew. Frank isn’t
entirely enthusiastic, but decides that this
might be their last shot at living the lives of
which they dreamed.

However, Frank soon finds contentment
in his life. He is offered a promotion that
would require a bit more work but involves
a substantial increase in pay. To get through
long days of work, a young, cute secretary

 

Locking lips with each other is no new experience for Kate Winset and -
DiCaprio, but "Revolutionary Road" is certainly not "Titanic the Sequel."

named Maureen Grube takes Frank out for
drinks and extramarital affairs of that sort.

“Revolutionary Road” is an extremely
thought—proVoking ﬁlm. Every character is
presented in different terms of feminism and
sexism. April is trying to be a modern woman
in a time when all women had going for them
was either a typewriter or children and chores.
April refuses that life. She wants to move to
France and support the family through a
government secretary job while Frank stays
at home and finds out what he really wants to
do with his life.

Even more obvious than the theme of
gender is the comparison between liberal and
conservative. The greatest example is when
April declares that she is pregnant to Frank.
Frank follows his inner conservative, and
says that now the move to France must be
canceled because the unborn child must be
raised in the United States. April, however,
chooses to have an abortion.

Along with April and Frank, Kathryn
Hahn (“Step Brothers”) and David Harbour
(“Brokeback Mountain”) are the Campbells,
the next-door neighbors. Milly Campbell
accepts her life in the suburbs as a genuine
way of living, but her husband, Shep, tries to
escape from suburban hell via a “romance”
with April.

Kathy Bates plays Helen Givings, the re-
altor who sells the Wheelers their house on
Revolutionary Road. It isn’t Bates, however,
who gives the best performance, but Michael
Shannon, who plays her son, John Givings.
John holds a doctorate in mathematics, and
is coming from an insane asylum where “they
shocked all the math out of him” with elec-

, ttoconvulsive therapy.

Revolutionary Road, page 9

 

January 20, 2009

‘Revolutionary Road’ shakes up the suburbs

Revolutionary Road, page 8

Shannon gives_ an unforgettable perfor-
mance as the light of truth in “Revolution-
ary Road.” He can point out the truth in any
character, as he does with April and Frank
on two occasions. He sees the lies that these
people are living and how unhappy they re-
ally are. .

Unfortunately, John is labeled an intellec-

' tual or a nut—job when the people he talks to

can’t handle the truth. What is most remark-
able about Shannon’s acting is the similarity
to Heath Ledger’s Joker in the summer block-
buster “The Dark Knight.” \X/ith Shar1non’s
verbal exaggerations and facial tics compa-
rable to the Joker’s lip smacks and eccentric
arm waving, it is surprising to see Ledger’s
inﬂuence already affecting the acting world.
Director Sam Mendes takes a 1950s dra-
ma of epic proportions and maintains the
emotional charge throughout the entire film.
Even in sequences of minimal action, Men-
des still creates the most intense scenes in the
history of cinema. 7
M After a climactic argument between April
and Frank resulting in April smoking outside
all night , and an upset Frank staring out the

window at her, Frank wakes up to a loving -

breakfast courtesy of April.
While the conversation is normal small

talk and the actions typical of a married and furyis bottled up inside April’s character
couple.’s breakfast, I have never been more
terriﬁed in a movie theater. So much emotion

the network that’s desperately lacking from
its movie schedule: entertainment value.

Unfortunately, the ﬂoundering ratings
might be a result of the same changes in
entertainment distribution that are render-
ing HBO’s movie lineup useless. Why spend
the extra money every month when you can
just rentor buy the show on DVD? If you
like the show enough to subscribe to HBO,
you’re probably going to do it anyway.

branding itself. “The United States of Tara”
joined Showtime’s original programming
lineup this Sunday, alongside popular shows
like “Dexter” and “Weeds.” Popularity is

relative, though — “Dexter” broke Show-

time records with its third—season ﬁnale last
month, which still scored less viewers than
the most recent season premiere of “Entou-
rage” — a three—year low for the series. Only
time —— and Nielsen results —- will tell for
“Tara.”

The way we watch movies is changing
faster than we can predict — Netflix users
can now stream movies directly to their tele-
visions, the iTunes store offers high—deﬁni-
tion rentals, and you can watch “Paul Blart:
Mall Cop” for free online (just ignore the
Korean subtitles).

Demand for 10 channels endlessly loop-

Showtime want to keep up with increasingly

sequence and exact, plus actually deal with the
cards and the dﬁnks and maintain their accents
and the drama,” said Biigden.

Three separate hands of cards are played
throughout the course of the play, giving rise

to the fear that an actor might confuse a line .

from one hand with another and have disas-
trous consequences.

Asking a director to choose a favorite part
of a production can be a like asking a parent
to choose a favorite child. Least favorite parts,
however, are not so difficult for Brigden.

“I absolutely have least favorite parts of the
play that just don’t seem to work in the run-
through, but sometimes the parts that you
think ‘Oh no that’s terrible, it’s not working,’
those are the parts that end up being the best
parts in play-”

City Theatre’s production will be the play’s

i regional premiere;

“The Seafarer” premiered in 2006 at Lon-
don’s National Theatre,  a nomination
for an Olivier Award for Best Play. The plays
Broadway run from Dec. 2007 to March 2008
garnered four Tony Award nominations, in-
cluding Best Play and Best Director, and won
in the category of Best Featured Actor.

“It’s clever, it’s a little edgy. There’s nothing
in this play that’s commercial and spoon fed to
you, you have to pay attention and keep up. It’s
a smart play and Pittsburgh has pretty smart
theater audiences who I think will really like it,”
said Biigden. I

Men's basketball, page 1 l

Pitt (l7—l, 5-1 Big East) led 3128 at the halﬂ but
had 10 turnovers to only seven assists The Panthers
made sure that changed in the second half, commit-
ting only one turnover the rest of the way while add-
ing an additional 11 assists

Fields had six of those assists and scored 15
points. He also helped to shut down Sy1acuse’s out-
side game

“[Pitt] ﬁnally got goingoffensivelyin the lastpart
of the second half?’ said Syracuse  Boe-
heirn “We were probably in the game longer than
we should have been”

Much like what happened to Pitt Cluﬁng Satur-
day’s loss to Louisville, No 8-ranked Syracuse was
ﬁ‘ustrated by foul trouble and struggled to hit key
shots down the stretch Pitt used physical play to
limit the Orange, which averaged 81.5 points per
game entering last night’s contest

‘ ‘\X/e’re still young at littie bit,” said Boeheirn “We
just didn’t make enough shots when we had the op-

January 20, 2009

portunity.’ ’

Dixon agreed and said that  a team like
Syracuse to such low numbers is something Pitt can
be proud of

‘ ‘To come out and do what we did tonight really
speaks volumes, especially on the defensive end,”
said Dixon “[The players] were challenged about
the rebounding numbers [against Louisville] and
they respond ” P

Blair was a constant force down low, 
12 rebounds and  20 points on 9of—14
shooting The sophomore recorded his 12th dou—
bledouble of the year.

But Blair said no matter how well he played, he
and Pitt can’t enjoy the win for long i

“lifter the game is over you just have to forget
about it,” said Blair “In a couple hours were 
to be worried about West Virginia.”
