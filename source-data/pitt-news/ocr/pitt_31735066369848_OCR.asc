I Reconsidering Darwin’s

Evolutionary Theory

By MARTY WILLIS

Charles Darwin’s theory of evolu-
tion is incomplete as an explanation
for evolutionary change, according
to paleontologist Niles Eldredge of
the American Museum of Natural
History.

Eldredge spoke Wednesday at a
lecture entitled “What’s Going On In
Evolutionary Theory?” sponsored
by the College of Arts and Sciences,
the University Honors Program, the
anthropology department and the
history and philosophy of science
department. I

“What we’re saying at the higher
levels now is that we. need a more
complex theory to explain some
thihgs. We don’t want to throw out
the old theory but rather to add to
it,” he said. Eldredge is a leading
proponent of the theory of punctu-
ated equilibria, which challenges the
longstanding notion of phyletic
gradualism put forth by Darwin and
later researchers.

, “This model [punctuated equili-
bria] has certainly caused a major
upheaval in the way people perceive
the picture of evolution and the
nature of evolutionary change," Jef-
frey Schwartz, professor of anthro-

pology, said. While no scientist is

ready to reject completely the Dar-
winian gradualist model, “we should
say that an alternative model does
exist and should be taken seriously,”
Schwartz said.

Briefly stated, the gradualist
model describes a given species as
evolving into another through a
slow, steady and constant process of
natural selection. Individual or-
ganisms that do not adapt quickly
enough to a changing environment
will die off, while those that adapt
more rapidly will survive.

In this way, the total gene pool of
the species changes over a period of
millions of ‘ years as only the
stronger, faster and better-adapted

‘individuals live long enough to

reproduce. Species A evolves into
species B, and no more members of
species A remain. ‘-

The punctuated equilibria model,

I by contrast, describes a given species

as remaining virtually unchanged,
or static,’ for millions of years. Then,
in a very short time, possibly 5,000
to 50,000 years, some of one species
rapidly evolves into another distinct
species. According to this model,
species A need not disappear in
order for species B to appear.

SGB Fights Internship Cuts

“The lectures we had_i[planr1/Sect/i]i,

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The Student Government Board
announced Wednesday that it is
beginning a campaign calling for the
reinstatement of a full-"time
Internship Office.. .

Both the board and the Black
Action Society will begin to circu-
late petitions among students with
the -eventual goal of obtaining 5000
signatures which will then be given
.to the administration. A letter-
writing campaign is in the planning
‘stages and" will "begin next week,
according to board member Mindy
Goldberg. A ' ~

Goldberg said Counseling Center

Office part-ti e. (tlaat it was the new-

‘ est office withimthe Counseling Cen-

- to school.

ter and thus the first oneto be cut)
was “not good enough.”

“I don’t believe there’s any such
thing as a low priority if it helps the
students,”’she said.

In other action, the board decided
to eliminate the Legal Awareness
Committee — one of its six standing
committees. The board ‘ voted

  

  
 
  

c\

unanimously with two abstentions,
Jeff Delmontagne and Barry
Greene, to dissolve and liquidate the
assests of the committee._ i
“The needs [of students] have
changed since it was originally

established,” board ‘member Jeff

Schaffer said. “The organization
was not allowed to offer legal advice,
just information." - -

The duties of the committee will
be taken over» by the Commuter
Resource Center temporarily before
being assumed by the revamped
Commuter Association.

The Board voted unanimously to
accept the recommendation of the
Allocations Committee to grant part
of a $10,319 emergency request from
the Pitt Hillel Club to fund a lecture

--A portion of the request, $4,270,
that was to be used A‘ for a
performance "by Andre Previn and
two lectures, “Substance Abuse"
and A “What: " is" “Love _ and
Commjttment?” was denied. Almost
$4000 is being held until Hillel finds
an on-campus location for the
approved lectures.

.‘‘We didn’t think that topic fit
within the realms of the organiza-
tion,” Steve Smith, chairman of the

' Allocations Committee, said.

say about almost every subject.”

Ed. Polovina, one of the. Greek
Week overall chairmen, requested,

that the. Board renumerate Greek

Week overall chairmen because it is,

such a time-consuming job.
“The amount of time spent is, in

comparison, in excess of other gov-_'

ernance group leaders who are renu-
merated,” Polovina said.

He said that he spends about 20‘

hours a ‘weekidoing .Greek,Week«7

work, and Greek Week itself isstill»
months away. Because it is so time-'

consuming, Polovina said he does,"
not have time to look/for a‘ regular

job.

I “As we all know,” board mcmber'¢f-'-‘"77
-Jeff, ‘Delmontagne.’ said, “Giteek.

group as any of the governance ,

groups we have now.” 5
Board member Jeff Schaffer said

that renumerating the overall_chair- 4

men of Greek Week could start a

precedent among the heads of other . I I

student organizations.

By KEVIN CECOT/II

Commuters should not be sur-
prised to find the parking situa-
tion in Oakland as dismal as ever
and the bus service not much bet-
ter. Why then has a project
designed to alleviate those very
problems met with such . little
success?

The project is the Commuter
Carpool Program, at the heart of
which lies a computer program
(COMCAP) designed to assist
commuters in the formation of
carpools. .

Marcia Anstandig, president
of the Commuter Association,
explained that the carpool pro-
gram was developed for many
reasons: to ease the parking
problem around campus, to
reduce the cost of driving to
school and to help improve com-
muter involvement.

The program requires sub-
stantial funding, $1894 in print-
ing and mailing costs this year
alone, as well as the coorperation
of many groups such as the Com-
muter Association, the Commu-
ter Resource Center and the
University Computer Center.

Anstandig, ‘however, believes
the cost are justified in light of
the total number of students it
could serve. According to the
Student Activities Office, 87 per-
cent of all Pitt students commute

Out of Gas     
Carpooling Efforts Sputter Along  

Last year when the program
was operated by the Commuter
Affairs Committee, 10,000
COMCAP forms were sent out,
but only 280 valid responses were
received. This year, over 650
responses had been received as of
Sept. 27, still far short of the
number needed to make the pro-
gram a full scale success, accord-
ing to Anstandig,

This year’s program, operated

~_by the Commuter Association,
also included evaluations by the

about the project and how they
thought the system could be
improved. As for why response
remains low, Anstandig cited
several reasons, ranging from
forms being filled out improperly
to lack of interest on the part of
students. ' '
An information form is sent
each year along with an informa-
tion booklet to commuting stu-
dents. Interested students
complete the form and specify if
they wish to" assume driving “

Graduate students from Pitt and
other universities in 70 countries
have a unique opportunity to be
awarded grants for a year of study
abroad through the 1984-85 Ful-
bright Program.

Most of the nearly 670 grants to
be awarded provide round-trip
transportation, tuition and mainte-
nance for one academic year. In

.@_‘..addition, there are several partial

grants that provide travel expenses
only or a stipend for studies.

Pitt applicants must be U.S. citi-
zens at the time of application and
generally must hold a 'bachelor’s
degree or its equivalent before the
beginning of their grant. However,
those graduate students who have
been doing graduate work or con-
ducting researchin their intended
host country for six months or more
during 1983-84 are ineligible. Cer-
tain other requirements exist in var-
ious situations. It is also strongly

--suggested that the student be profi-

cient in the language of the host
country.

Pitt has approximately 12-15
applicants annually, according to
Angi Yucas, the director of the
Study Abroad Office. Inthe 1982-83
academic year, Yucas said one Pitt
student was accepted as an alternate
to Germany and another was
awarded a travel grant to Germany.

5* In the current academic year, how-

ever, four full grants and one alter-
nate grant were awarded to Pitt
students.

“Pitt has definitely moved up,”
Yucas said.

The grant program was originated
by Senator William Fulbright

The Pitt News, Friday, September 30, 1983

P-FU/bi‘/Qhl‘ Grants Open Door toWorId

because, according to Yucas, “He
recognized the need for more lan-
guage studies and for American stu-
dents to conduct studies abroad.-

“It is a very prestigious award and
is one of the most generous awards
offered," according to Yucas. “It is
one of the top national awards
possible.”

Funding for the Fulbright grants
comes from foreign governments;
universities and private ‘donors. The
program is operated through a bilat-
eral exchange ‘system with the

, nations on both ends participating

in the selection process. According
to Yucas, the final selection is done
in the host country, but the initial
screenings and selections are carried
out in the student’s home country.

“We’re looking for top scholastic
candidates and serious students with
very definite academic interests to
pursue in much greater depth,”
Yucas said. She noted that course
work, independent reasearch or a
combination of both may be done by
the recipient.

Yucas stressed that no student
may accept one of ihese grants
merely for the sake of taking a trip
abroad. “The student must justify
his presence in the foreign country,”
Yucas said. “It is essential that a par-
ticular study or particular resources
be available. Students without a
sound proposal are quickly singled
out.” '

The program provides students
with the opportunity to study in vir-
tually any region of the world, such
as Western Europe, the Mideast,
Africa and even the East Bloc coun-
tries, inluding the U.S.S.R.

Yucas noted that the greatest
application from Pitt students is to

the United Kingdom because thereis
no language barrier. Therefore, she
said, a grant to the United Kingdom
is the toughest to get. Grants for
South American countries, espe-
cially Brazil, are the easiestto obtain
because so few students speak fluent
Portugese. In such a region, “the
language ability is essential,” Yucas
said. As for the European countries,
Yucas said Germany offers the most
opportunities.

While she is delighted with the
program‘s success, Yucas is disap-
pointed in the fact that relatively few
graduating seniors apply. “We have

a lot of interest among graduate stu-
dents, but I have been disappointed
that few graduating seniors are app-
lying.” She strongly enco‘urages
them to apply for these international
study opportunities.

“Once a student is accepted,
Yucas said, “he is considered a Ful-
bright fellow for life.” ' ‘ I

away from applying, she does screen

Yucas said there is some competi-

reason, she said more Pitt students
should take advantage. . '

  Deserving  
    A Raise?

Wednesdayenight, while welfare recipients slept in
the rotunda of the state capital, the Pennsylvania
_ House passed a bill giving its members and other state
4 ,-officials a,$l0,000 raise. V _ _
The raise, if approved by Pennsylvania_Gov. Dick
Thornburgh, would mean an increase in salary for.
legislators, cabinet officers and other officials elected

statewide.

The vote in the House was narrow — 103-98 '——but

the state lawmakers passed it in 2_0Ami,nutes ‘without’ if .
A debate. The Senate eariler passed th_e bill with barely 
giving it a glance. _  . . _ - 

A_ spokesman for Thornburgh said he is expected to
OK/the bill. ' _

.If the ‘bill is ‘passed, one can only-help wonder what
the state lawmakers have done lately to deserve such a
lofty payincrease. . i . ', «~ V
i The Pennsylvania House and Senate seemto be at a '

, standstill in issues that are crucial to the state —
especially the Southwestern Pennsylvania area. S
— For example, earlier this year, it was announced‘
that Pittsburgh had the third highest concentration of
Fortune 500 companies in the country. Yet, whatdo
we have to show for it? Craters, lovingly called

. “potholes,” in the str.eets,‘bridges that are deteriorat-
ing and a mas's‘transit systemthat is one iofithe most
expensive in the country. i i  ' -

Maybe if statelawmakers used some ofthe funds for
something other than giving themselves a‘ raise, we
could look more like a Fortune 500 city and hurry
along the Renaissance II project.

Also, in the area of state tuition, ifthe state budget
has enough money to grant pay hikes to lawmakers,
shouldn’t there be a little left for appropriations to the
institutions of higher education? Pitt students could
use a break from tuition hikes year after year.

Finally, Pennsylvania is one of the leaders in unem-
ployment in the country, a fact that should embarrass

_ state lawmakers. At least everyone inthe state. has
been affected in one way or another by plant closings,
lay-offs and budget cuts. Yet, the legislators go ahead
and try to give themselves a raise. ‘

The point is that Pennsylvania government has not
done much, especially in this area of the state, to
warrant a pay increase. True, its members have fami-
lies to support, but (unless they are impeached" or not
re-elected)_they probably will not have to worry about
losing theirjobs and finding alternative means to feed
their families. e\h

lt’s about timethe state legislators in Harrisburg ‘
started thinking more about the state and less about A
their pocketbooks.

Discovering Reservoi rs Oflfio pe

Dear Editor: - -

Inian editorial of septf 19, The

Pitt News castigates Molly Rush \

and me for the radical and ineffec-_
tive. way we oppose the building of
nuclear weapons, especially those
designed "for first-strike use‘. “Aside
from“, their farnilies and friends,
nobody really cares about thejailing
of these protestors,” whom the
author of the editorial imagines are
“probably viewed as little pests and
are not taken‘ seriously." If nobody
indeed cares, l wonder that The Pitt
News saw fit to devote a column to
this event, including in its denuncia-

tion the people who offered their ‘

lives in an open-ended Fast for Life.
“They are hurting nobody except
themselves and their families” and
are thus “taking it a little too far.”

The reason for non-violent resistf—_ "

Dear Editor;

My comments are in response to

a Mr. L31wson’s comments on Friday,

“Sept. 16. It seemed that Mr. Law-
son’s initial point was to draw an
analogy between the bombing ofthe
Korean jet and the I973 downing of
a Libyan jet by lsrael.

However, his romantic views led
him from his assumed point to a
personal attack on Israel. He also so
carefully neglected to support his
views with the proper facts, such as
whether the country was in a state of
war at the time. Moreover, the air
force planes tried to gain the atten-
tion ofthe pilot, though there was no

obedi'ents,',’believe that one goes too

Nor is the motive-f5r'civ_il disobe- .

dience press covera’ge,-which is-'often
scanty and inexact. The Pitt News

should not, for example, lift its facts
directly from The Pittsburgh Press
without checking their accuracy: it is

poor journalism to transmit error in
this way.)pWe believe we have the
power to resist and that, in acts of
_conscience, we can call on the same
kind of power in others. We are ask-
ing others to know and exercise that
power of conscience and, "therefore,

to take risl_<s’.[If they oppose the evil
that hasbécorrie the nation’s most_

theirjobs, their security, their stand-
i.ng among friends a-ndcollehagues.
We cannot ask them to take such

‘risks while we ourselves refuse to

Furthermore, -compensation- was

from Israel.

If Mr. Lawson so .gregariously
chooses to discuss the shooting
down of innocent passenger planes,
then I should like to ‘remind him of
the El Al ﬂightin 1955, travelling
from Venice to Tel Aviv, which was
shot down after going off course in
heavy storms over Bulgaria. Over
200 people were killed, and no com-
pensation was made.

Mr. Lawson not only fails to
make a properly supported analogy,
but he also fails in proving anything

the same ways that have been inef-
fectual in the past. In fact, non-
violent resistance, while little tried,

plete revolutions of Gandhi and

Martin Luther King attest to that. V

What The Pitt News fears is the awai

kened conscience which refuses any '

longer to accept hopelessness as the

condition for facing the future. It .

isn’t so much that Molly and I err in
being tiresomely radical:
what is tiring is the pretense that
nothing is wrong, that we can go on
day after day doing what we’ve
always done. We live in terrifying

Dear Editor:

This is an open letter to all
sororities who customarily con-
duct songfests and sing-a-longs
in the Schenley Quad during
evenings when other students are
struggling with their academic
loads, studying for tests or enjoy-
ing much-needed sleep. You are
hereby notified that this sort of
raucous conduct (for which the
rest of us get arrested) will no
longer be passively tolerated.

Let me first state that I have
nothing against fraternities or
sororities. I never felt an inclina-

« bly valuable organizations, and I

don’t think I should be forced to
endure your silly out-of-key ritu-

Soviet Should Be Condemned. 

It always amuses me how the spo-
kespeople for the Soviet U nion, offi-
cial or self appointed, can take any
issue whatsoever and turn it into an
anti-Israel or anti-Semitic tirade.
My amusement turns to‘ abhorence,
however, when this is done to lessen
their responsibility for the cold-
blooded, brutal murder of 236
unsuspecting air travelers.

- In Mr; -Mark Lawson's fervor to
vilify Israel and accuse the United
States of anti-communist hysteria
(Pitt News, 9/ I6/83) he somewhat
conveniently torgets . to fault the
Soviet Union for the heinous act.
The impression given«in his letter is
that the Russians were indeed justi-
fied in their act of mass murder. Per-

haps M ii. Lawson could‘ explain the

justification to the university com-
mun-it_y which has lost one of its own
over theskies of the Soviet Union.

If Mr. Lawson wants a parallel

"I ' case", let him" examine the case of the

first civilian airliner shot down. It-
happened in Bulgaria, a communist
country, in 1955. The plane which
was shot down was an El Al plane

I‘ (lsrael’s airline) and there were no.’

survivors. Mr. Lawson’s silence on
this incident is deafening, especially
as the father of one of my close
friends was a passenger on that fate-
ful ﬂight.

The tragedy which occured over
Sinai in 1973 was just that —
tragedy. ‘However, circumstances
being different, a parallel can not be
drawn. In I973, Libya was (and still
is) in a declared state of war against
Israel. Libya’s plane passed over a

route often used for attacking Israel.
After refusing to heed Israeli warn-
ings, a decision was made to shoot
down the place. Israel cooperated
fully in an international investiga-
tion of this incident. Immediately
following the downing, it rushed
medical aid to the sceneeand paid full
compensation payments. The Soviet
‘Union is not in a state of war. Korea
had not publicly proclaimed a vow
to. destroy the U.S.S.R. Nor has
Israel ever denied shooting down the
Libyan airliner. The Soviet Union
not only will not cooperate in an
international investigation but is
doing everything is its power to foil
any attempt to unbiasedly investi-
gate the incident. As to compensa-
tion payments, the Soviet positionis
quite clear: not now not ever. The
world did not, as Mr Lawson con-

tends, gloss over the Israeli downing «

of the Libyan airliner. The same
U.N. committee which condemned

"the U.S.S.R. condemned Israel in

clear and determined language.

It is highly possible that Mark
Lawson is sincere in his belief that
the unfortunate
Libyan airliner was glossed .over.
The effect and impact of the con-
demnation might very well have
been considerably lessened by being
viewed as just another of the daily
U._N. diatribes against the State of
Israel. The number and scope of

these diatribes leave very little left to ‘

condemn Israel for other than driv-
lng on the right of the road, if this
has not already been done.

As to Lawson’s seekingto connect
Moscow’s murder of civilians over

incident of the, condemnation of Israel,

Sakhalin Island and the Middle ,
East, he may not be that far off the 1 _

mark. The-U nited States Marines in  3

Lebanon and the passengers of,

Korean Airliner flight 007 were both- . .' "V in I

killed by the same thing —- Soviet-
made weapons. ‘ ,
The writer accuses the p_eople'_of
the United States of “anti-commuist
hysteria.” If recognition . of the

Soviet’s goal to undermine the West- ‘  "S A '

ern (read capitalist) world and;‘
impose upon us its manner of
government (read communist/ re--

pressive)- is, as Lawson termslit,

“anti-communist hysteria,“ then i
both Lenin and Trotsky suffered‘
-from this malady. ‘

In re-reading Mr. Lawson's arti-

cle, one is_forced_ to ask: How canal

Lawson not condemn the Soviet

Union for killing so manycivilians?’

How can Lawson, in good con-

science, seek to cloud the issues?.

Perhaps most importantly, towards

(what end does he do this? _ .
Given Mr. Lawson's form of rea-.,_

soning, that no matter what goes
wrong,
world, the only suitable response is a

surely earned himself a place in the ‘  A

United Nations, and to echo Mr.

farewell to both Mr.Lawson and the
entire United Nations. ’ '

taxation’ of tuition assistance by the
federal government.

Students who currently receive
tuition benefits from corporations
such as Westinghouse or PPG
Industries are not taxed on the
amount of assistance they receive.

The bill's provisions allow for
taxation of tuition assistance for
those students whose parents work
for the university. and would thus be
taking a chunk out of the salaries of
many»Pitt employees‘.

If the bill fails, to pass, those stu-

@—-dents would have tostart paying

taxes on that tuition assistance as of
January I984.

Boag said the passage of the bill  :j_

may potentially affect every student ji 

by causing another tuition increase.

“There are an awful lot of people
who are working in this university
because they are going to college or
have children going to college,” she
said. “If our salaries have to go up to
compensate for this [taxation], the
next thing that will be raised is tui-
tion. In the long run, this has the
potential to affect every single stu-
dent in the university.”

The Pitt‘News, Friday, September 30,1983

Media Adviser Ace

Dr. Larry Lunsford, assistant
director of student activities and
Pitt's studentmedia adviser, will be
leaving his position to become
Assistant Dean of Students at
Robert Morris College, and chief
administrator of-the college's down-
town center.

Lu nsford came to the university in
I977 to serve as both the student
media and'Greek adviser. Two years
later, the position was divided and
he retained his role as media adviser.

Over the past seven years, Luns-
ford has seen many changes occur in
every aspect of Pitt’s student media.

WPGH, the university radio sta-
tion, was recently notified that its
request for an FM license, had been

/approved. This signals the endof a

long process that began in 1977, the
year Lunsford arrived here and he
sees the licensing as a major step for
both the station and the university
community.

Another part ofthe student media
that‘ Lunsford has seen grow is the
literary magazine Backspace',which
has been ranked among the nation’s
top magazines of its kind. Lunsford
takes pride in the fact that it is con-
sistently a quality effort.

For 74 years, Panther Prints was
known as The Owl. Yearbooks were
dying at the time and Lunsford saw
them as fighting a losing battle.

The name was changed from/The V

Owl to Panther Prints — the first of
many steps in the right direction.
There are_now 30 members on the
yearbook staff, and there is a
marked increase in sales, all positive
signs for the yearbook.

When Lunsford first started at
Pitt, the school newspaper, The Pitt
News, was operating with a $33,000
deficit. Since then, Lunsford has
instituted tight cost management
measures and developed an effective

advertising staff, which has enabled '_

GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDESI
BUT GENTLEMEN MARRY

A BRUNETTES
 By Anita Loos

Vintage

Miss Lorelei Lee is a professional

lady; her profession is gold-digging.

She's very good at what she does;
she's blonde, and gentlemen seem to
prefer it. Close friend Dorothy Shaw

(a brunette) equals «Lorelei in all
respects- except hair color. Their
humorous adventures are chronicled
in a pair of Anita Loos novels: Gentle-
men Prefer Blondes and But,Gentlemen
Marry Brunettes,‘ now available in one
volume with an introduction by the
author.

Anita Loos wrote for the moving
pictures in the early 1920s, and she
developed Lorelei Lee as a character
sketch for a short story. Following
later revisions, the piece was serial-
ized in its entirety in Harper's Bazaar in
1925; William Faulkner, James Joyce
and Edith Wharton _were among
those who hailed it as \an American
Classic. The sequel appeared in 1927,

 and the virtues of both works -. after

— nearly 60 years — are still apparent.
In the form of a diary» and the ver-
nacular of a not-particularly-bright
girl who went very far very quickly,
the set is frequently hilarious, often
poignant and something of a philo-

‘ sophical masterpiece.

”A gentleman friend and I were
dining at the Ritz last evening, and he
said that if I took a pencil and paper
and put down all of my thoughts, it

~ would make a book,” Lorelei writes,

opening Blondes with the first entry in
a new diary, a gift from last evening's
gentleman friend. Her impressions
document ,March 16 through July 10,
and she “manages to work through a
succession of gentleman friends.

As a youngster in Little Rock,
Arkansas, Lorelei realized that she
could do better; she uses her grown-

 -up blonde attractiveness to advan-

tage. Her goals are simple —— money
and diamonds (lesser jewels will suf-
fice) ' first and a wealthy husband
afterwards. ‘ She makes a habit of
involving herself with rich; men of
influential background; generally,
when their sons propose ‘marriage,
» the families are willing to buy her off.

Showcase, Friday, September 30, I983

 «eIInI2I|_s\wuI1rIrI
I|_«o~t>s' .
/\V\\ID|l2A\|L§    

A botched attempt, however, finds -

Lorelei in Europe with Dorothy along
for the ride. The gentlemen they
meet seem to prefer blondes as well
as brunettes; Lorelei ultimately
snares a wealthy husband in Henry
Spoffard, although ”Dorothy says
the only thing she could stand being
to Henry would be to be his widow at
the age of 18.” Lorelei's honest,
unpretentious_ diary entries record

her observations of America and
Europe and the customs and quirks of
society. She's satisfied that ”every-
thing always turns out for the best.”

Dorothy's caustic wit and similar
adventures provide Lorelei ‘ with

much of her copy. ”Dorothy looked at I
me and looked at me...she said my’

brains reminded her of a radio
because you listen to it for days -and

‘ you get discouraged and just when

you are getting ready to smash it-,

something comes out a masterpiece,” '

Lorelei writes.

Blondes and is as good as its predeces-
sor. Lorelei — married still and-preg-
nant — takes up the literary vocation
again, choosing Dorothy as ajtopic.
”The life of Dorothy isnot going to be
so muchifor girls to resemble, as it is
to give them a warning what they
should stop doing."

Dorothy, Lorelei reports, came
from a carnival family and thorough-
ly enjoyed the rough life. Dorothy
has a habit of falling in love with gen-
tlemen regardless of their financial
status; along the way, she loses her
virtue to a traveling actor becomes an
actress herself and acquires two hus-
bands. The first, a lazy sax player, is
politely murdered after their compli-
cated divorce. All ends well with
Charlie Vandervent; his parents dis-
own him, but he settles down with
Dorothy and sells automobiles for a
living. Brunettes concludes with Lore-
lei's firm decision to install Dorothy
in the social register. .

work is still contemporary in theme
and, perhaps more importantly, still
very funny. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes
and But Gentlemen Marry’Brunette5 pro-
vide laugh-out-loud entertainment;
as the cover accurately‘ announces,
”two great novels.” -

NEW TECHNOLOGY COLORING ‘

BOOK V .
By Rita Aero and Howard Rheingold
Bantam

”Psychologists have recently disco-
vered that the form used to present
information is a key to understanding
it.” Keep that in mind. Next up —
does the new technology have you
confused? Do you leave the room

when your friends start talking aboutm

black holes, tectonics, CAT scans,
acid rain or even Skylab? Rita Aero
and Howard Rheingold have found
the right form to help you learn about
Big Science. Get out your crayons,
kids, because it's a coloring book.
The idea isn't quite as unusual as it
seems. The old ”a picture's worth ‘a
thousand words” adage hides some

- fact — besides breaking the monot-

ony a bit, pictures and charts make

even textbooks easier to read and

understand. The‘New Technology Color-
ing Book explores 35 scientific]
advancements which are rapidly
becoming part of our daily lives.
The _'color—by—numbers
makes it easy — ”1” is red; ”3". is
orange; ”6" is blue and so on. There's

format"

a follow—the—dot and a even a cut-out '

to demonstrate topology. Back-V

ground andexplanations provide rea-
sonably good introductions to
ceramics, nuclear reactors,‘ satellite
networks, microcomputers and
more. A little science know-how
helps, however.

The intricate designs require a
steady hand; Staying in the lines.
acquires more significance, but the

results are vivid. New Tech serves up '

some neat stuff. Possible drawback:
do consenting adults ever use color-
ing books anymore?

THE CAST

The Fleshtones: A super-cool rock
band bent on world domination or
having a good time —— whichever
comes first. According to the back of
their latest album, Hexbreaker, "it's
been said that the Fleshtones aren't
just a pop group but an outlook, a way
of life. "Of course, the group made
that up themselves but it seems to
apply in this case. The individual
bandmembers are:

Peter Zaremba: Vocals, percussion
and wild screaming. Peter was the
victim of childhood acne and eventu-
ally sacrificed the left lobe of his brain
to the great god Carbona. Otherwise,
he's a brilliant conversationalist who

knows seven different dialects of

Brooklynese. Dresses in paisley when
he can find it.
Keith Streng: Guitarist extraordi-

naire and orchestra leader. Keith's_

favorite statement is, "Where are the
dancing girls?" but when he's coher-
ent he can be quite a historian —
especially as concerns the Fleshtones.
Pay attention to Keith's lines, as they
make sense. Dresses in velour and
turtlenecks.

Ian Marek Pakulski: Bass. Affection-
ately know as "Marek" because no
one can pronounce the rest of his
name. Adds enough ethnicity to the
band's line—up for them to be consi-
dered as Level V Civil Service
Employees. Dresses in blue and white
striped oxfords.

Gordon Spaeth: Saxophone, Har-
monica and Other. Gordon loves to
fondle his saxophone and laugh a lot.
He helped Peter sacrifice his left lobe.

. confrontation.

Also dresses in turtlenecks.

Bill Milhizer: Drums. Except for his
onstage antics, Bill is rumored to be a
deaf-mute since he doesn't say much
and stares a lot. He is partial to red
and white oxfords.

SHOWCASE: Rumored to be _a large

cinemette chain in Allegheny
County, but is actually a super-cool
arts mag bent on world domination
or having a good time -— whichever
comes first. Edited by deaf—mutes
with a penchant for burlap.

Tall Groupie: Disguised as journalist
but. is actually one of those card-
carrying cretins who goes to that
Catholic university down the street.
Dressed in Naugahyde.

Small Groupie: Same only shorter.

chicken? Sure, have some chicken;
have some salad, too —— it's good for
you.

SHOWCASE: (grabbing several breasts}
Thanks, but what I really want is an
interview with you. Besides, this is
my seventh piece, and I already had
some salad.

ZAREMBA: Relax, the night is still
young. —
SHOWCASE: (feeling rejected, but
undauntedl Keith Streng? How'd you,
like to talk about the Fleshtones?
STRENG: Sure. Why don't you have
some chicken?

SHOWCASE: (starting to feel bloated)
Thanks. »

STRENG: Well, do you wanna go
back, way back —— turn back the clock
of history? (pause) What's the matter?
SHOWCASE: (fumbling with tape
recorder) Er, all this chicken made my
hands greasy, and I can’t'turn the

recorder on. There, now what were I

you saying? ,.
STRENG: Well, I'll tell you the truth.
We've all known each other quite a
while except maybe our drummer —I
guess we met him when he joined the
band. But I've known Marek since
I've been 14; I've known Peter since
I've been 17; and I've known Gordon
since I've been 17.

SHOW: How old are you now?
STRENG: Twenty-seven. Anyway,
Marek and I were renting this house
in the suburbs of New York City —
it's a residential area. called White-
stone. We had a basement that we
refinished into a rehearsal studio, got
a bunch of equipment together and
started jamming. Then Peter came
over, and we said, "Hey, Peter, why
don't we form a group and play origi-
nal music?" .
MAREK: Peter didn't want to, but he
changed his mind four minutes later.
ZAREMBA: (shouting from the other side
of the room) My foster parents grossly
mistreated me. Later, I was playing
hooky from school, being truant, and
I fell into the bad company of Gordon
Spaeth, down by the»Flushing River.

SPAETH: (from the same side of the room}
We couldn't get out of t-he mud, so we
sniffed glue together. V
ZAREMBA: We sniffed glue together
and then — it's true actually. _
STRENG: (continuing) Naw, he wanted
to form a group, and at that point a lot
of good things were happening in the

"It's actually very relevant — what we
are. How could being fun and cool not

be relevant?”

SCENE ONE: The‘Fleshtones have
just finished playing a gig at Heaven
(for those preoccupied with theater
symbolism, this does not represent
any). Avoiding the throng of 15 or 20
screaming fans, they quietly slip into
their dressing room upstairs where
SHOWCASE and the two groupies
are already waiting along with sev-
eral farm animals (roadies?), two
enormous trays of chicken, a tossed
salad and beverages. There is a

groups like the Ramones, Tuff Darts

we figured, why‘don't we go into the
city and play our original music, you
know? . l -

SMALL GROUPIE: (interrupting with a

wasn't into playing anymore. We
added Bill and Gordon in 1981 or so,
and that's pretty much how the band
is, why it is today.

SHOW: How do you describe the
Fleshtones music?

STRENG: I call it Super-rock (laughs).
SHOW: Like Super-Fleshtones?
STRENG: Yeah, everything about it
is super, you know — it's,just like the
best. It's the best of what we are and
what we like. _

SHOW: What about new psychedelic
bands like the Alarm; do you think
that they're copying your style of
music.

STRENC: I don't think that they're
really doing music like we are. To me,
the Alarm are just like the new Clash
or something - very politically
oriented. I don't think they focus on
the rhythm end of rock—n-roll. I think
they're very serious there — they
take themselves too seriously.
SHOW: Is that what the Fleshtones
focus on — fun? '
STRENG: We focus on whatever we
think is cool, and most of the time we
think fun is cool; things being super,
you know — Super—rock. g '
SHOW: What about your music's
resemblance to the '60s’ tunes?
STRENG: Well, we all like that stuff.
We all grew up listening to it on the
radio, when radio was worth listen-
ing to. We're all roughly the same age
so at one point in our lives, we were
all listening to AM radio which was
the big happenin' thing before FM
came along. You used to hear any-
thing from the Stones, to the Beatles,
to the Supremes, to Smokey Robin-
son, to Wilson Pickett. You used to be
able to just sit down and listen to your
radio for entertainment, whereas
now, you can't unless you're going to
listen to college radio.

SHOW: Well, what about the way

you're dressed in the velour shirt, the

turtleneck and the love beads. Is that
supposed to symbolize a '60s’ revival
or something? _

STRENG: I think a lot of people wore
these clothes in the '60s, but it just
depends on how you mix them up
(points to his quasi~Beatle boots). I mean I
think these boots should never have
gone out of style because I think
they_'re really cool. I think they're like
the ultimate in gbootery (snickers). I
mean, I also have a paisley shirt, but I
didn't wear that tonight. We all gen-
erally like the samekind of clothing,

”MAREK”

faint as to a direction, whereas Hex-
brealcer really finds one sound and one
direction for the Fleshtones. There
were so many different variations of
songs on Roman Gods — it was very
sporadic where Héxbreaker follows one
line._,.It,'s one peak — it makes more
sense as an album. I like Roman Gods a
lot, but it's probably easier for some-
one to listen to Herhreaker.

SHOW: Do the Fleshtones have any
goals or obsessions? '
STRENC: We'd like to have a hit
record plus we'd like to be financially
secure since we only make enough
money to live and support a tour.
Also, we'd love to change the course
of music as far as radio is concerned.
We'd love to hear an FM station play

"We're the heaviest band around — we
have the metallic sound.”

‘ and a lot of the band is centered

around the '60s’ styling, but it's='not
like we just stick to a formula. Sure,
there's an influence as far as the clo-
thing and there's an influence in the

I music — you know I loved all that

trashy rock—n-roll of the '60s, but it's
not like we're trying to recreate it or
bring something back. It's just part of
our chemistry. I don't go out of my

-way to get paisley — I've always had

them. I just didn't grow much (smiles).
SHOW: Where does the Fleshtones’
music fit in today's society? _
STRENG: It's actually very relevant
— what we are. How could being fun
and cool not be relevant?

SHOW: What about a song like "New
Scene" — is that a comment on
today's society? -
STRENG:"'The New Scene" is real,
it's about today. You know the cho-
rus, "lt's a crazy mixed up world"?
Well, it is. Of course, there's '60s’ ref-
erences from where it's coming — the
lyrics would have worked then also
because a lot of what happened then
is still relevant today. It's not trying
to bring the '60s back, it's just that,
sometimes, history repeats itself.
SHOW: Where does your new album,

Hexbreaker, put the Fleshtones in your
career?

STRENG: Roman Gods was kind of
”New Scene" or "Hexbreaker"
because there's nothing like that hap-
pening. Our stuff isn't out-to—lunch
or anything. I think it's totally
relevant.

ZAREMBA: (screaming and interrupting
everything} Wait a minute everybody,
it's my goddamn birthday!

ALL: Yeah!

ZAREMBA: (passing a bottle of vodka) I
want everybody to have a drink with
me. Now you can either put it in a
glass or take it like a man._(Which prob-
ably means drinking from the same bottlethat

ZAREMBA: {parading around the room

year, you present me with a mylar
cape, but this is the most attractive of
all the mylar capes you've given me.
Thank you very much. I must say,
would Sting do this?

ALL: No!

ZAREMBA: Sting is actually very
polite. I saw him once.

TALL CROUPIE: {standing on window

remember when . . .

ALL: Shut up and jump!
ZAREMBA: I'd like to propose a toast
to all our pals in Pittsburgh who made
this a really nice night after it could
have been a real disaster.

SMALL GROUPIE: Thanks to the
Fleshtones, I'm missing my morning
classes.

ALL: {Snicker/l I
ZAREMBA: {with a glintofevil in his eyes}
We'll educate you. Sit down and have
some chicken with us. We'll tell you
all about the world.

STRENG: (continuing with his comments)
Where were we? We're the heaviest
band around — we have the metallic
sound. My goal is to be happy and
lead a Super-rock life. I think I'll live
in Super-rock Hills when_I get older.
That's where I'm going.

SHOW: How long are the Fleshtones
going to last?

STRENG: The Fleshtones are going
to last as long as the world lasts. I
mean, in this day and age,it could be
any day now.

HIGHLAND, HARD RAIN

. Aztec Camera _

' Sire, Records

While some bands, such as
"Thompson Twins and Human
League,. have chosen to discard
the guitar from their sound

,-altogether, at least one other
' bandvhas decided that a back—to-

basics approach might béjust as
well. 

Riding an almost simultane-
ous wave of interest in.the Uni-
ted States withfellow Scotsmen
Big Country, Aztec Camera
demands a second look of its
own on the strength of the
band's engaging debut album,
High Land, Hard Rain.

Fronted by 19-year old Roddy
Frame playing, more often than
not, acoustic guitar, Aztec
Camera eases through an album
full of young—confused—and-in-
love songs. The sincerity of a
teenage lead singer, songwriter
and guitar player gives a decided
edge to Aztec Camera’s music
that is lacking in, say, a Bryan
Adams.

HANGIN' UP MY HEART
Sissy Spacek
Atlantic

Sissy Spacek wanted to be a
singer long before she was

‘drenched in pig's blood in the

movie Carrie. She finally got her
chance to croon her way

V through the film Coal -Miner's

Daughter, and won every major
”best actress” accolade for her

V astonishing portrayal of Loretta

Lynn.

A Hangin' Up My Heart, her first
album, stretches that country
formula toward mainstream
pop. How does Spacek fare? She
can sing, yes; but with mixed
results. On one hand, she molds
her voice nicely around a song
about consummate lovers (”Old
Home Town”), but she's a disas-

vter trying to re-imitate Loretta

Lynn on their only collaboration
from the disc (”Smooth Talkin’
Daddy"). She's at her best on
the self-penned "He Don't
Know_Me," where she casually-
writes off her boyfriend ("He's
convinced he'll show me the

Frame's theme of"

urgency is compelling even on
the few songs here that don't
quite work. _
Listen closely, however, “and
there's plenty here that's work-
ing quite well. "Oblivious," the
album's lead cut, has established
itself on the new music plays-
lists, while "Walk Out To Win-

' ter ," ”The Boy Wonders" and

”Pillar to Post" combine the
same instincts and allure that
make you want to hear "Obliv-
ious" again. e
Frame weaves often complex
chord structuresaround a lyric
so naive and exploring that it
sometimes seems as if the music

will be unable to holdthe lyric. ‘

This actually happens several
times on the second sideof the
album, but by then Aztec

‘,Camera has already sold you on

‘the legitimacy of their unique
acoustic pop. An occasional
youthful indiscretion doesn't
seem to disturb this album's
appeal —— in fact it's a vital part

of the record's attractiveness.

One item of concern for
Aztec Camera: Rodd Frame

on a little rock number called,
"This Time'I'm Gonna Beat You
To The Truck" that sizzles /like
country bacon’(”You can't fool
me/I've ; got my own set .‘_of

While most of Hangin' Up My

Heart is enjoyable to listen to -
(especially if you've got a nice, ‘ '

cold beer in hand), it doesn't
establish ‘Spacek as a major
threat to today's pop queens,
nor is it likely to‘ appeal to a
Pittsburgh" audience (it would
feel much more at home on a
Morgantown turntable).

Almost 16 years ago, Spacek
cut her first single for Roulette
Records called ”John, You've
Gone Too Far This Time"
(scolding John Lennon for pos-
ing nude with Yoko on the
album cover of Two Virgins), and
she's come a long way since. But
she insists she never kept a copy
of that song, and in another 10
years or so, I doubt she'll own a
copy of Hangin' Up My-Heart
either.

Yes, another ‘one bites the

indicative of a sorry trend from

nothing we haven't heard

banging his head against the
wall, trying to figure out who

grow on you. No "Nights In

True, "Gemini Dream" and

adaptation to the '80s, but The

impression that they're running

The apparent musical atti-

summed up in what could have

easily been the title song:
”Going Nowhere." A key miss-
ing ingredient is the poetic lyrics
of previous Blues’ greats like

"Nights In W White Satin" or

"Legend of the Mind." The Pres-
ent relies too heavily on cliche
lyrical themes and melodies, and
leaves you with the feeling that
these guys sat_ in a room and
said, "Hey, we haven't done an

HARD
Gang of Four
EMI

The music is too polished; the
constant slashing guitar of
Andy Gill and biting vocals of
both Gill and Jon King, trade-
marks of the Gang of Four
sound, are lacking on Hard, their
latest release. Gang of Four’s
”sophisticated funk,” powered
by the strong Sara Lee bass
lines, still entraps the listener,
though, and the lyrics symbol-
ize the‘group's transition from
outsiders looking in upon a capi-
talistic, success-driven society
to disillusioned participants in
the structure: "Like you said when
we crawled down from the trees./We're
in transition/I don't want to remain on
the edge/We rnust embrace the new
conditions."

The shrill, unorthodox Gang‘

of Four sound is not totally
abandoned» on this, their fourth
LP; the redeeming track, ”Wom-
antown,” features the vocal ver-
satility of King
scrupulous guitar riffs by Gill.
"Is it Love" and ”A Piece of my
Heart” are both likely candi-
dates for a good amount of air-
play ‘on major radio stations,

which with the exception of.

their single last year, ”Man In A
Uniform,” would be a first for
Gang of Four. With their new
smoothesound, I wouldn't be
surprised to hear more of the
songs from this album on the
airwaves, although this seems

incongruent with the ”non-
trendish philosophy” Gang of
Four has always represented.
If there is a theme for every
album, Hard mirrors the game of
acquiring success a_nd_the disap-

piontment in the end result: ”I'm—

all right, I'm all right/Though it's a
contradirtion/It's enough, but less than
I imagined." This theme also
represents the progression of
the band itself over the years —
once a group of observers, now,
through their growing success,
drawn into the world for which
they hadso much distas e. But
the intensity their priuvious lyr-
ics embodied is not wanting on
Hard. The theme may be slightly
reversed, yet one still walks
away after hearing the new lyr-
ics with a sense that Gang of

Four is still as profoundly pro— V

lific as they have always been.
Gang of Four has not actually

left behind the abrupt, harsh,

screaming style of the past; the

I style exhibited on Hard is more

refined, the sound more glossy.
And to an ardent Gang of Four
fan, the album may personify its
theme: ”It's enough, -but less

A than I imagined.”

October has come along. The sign '

of autumn in full forage has not
become clear as of yet, but it will in
Morgantown tomorrow afternoon..

West Virginia and Pitt renew their
age-long war at Mountaineer Field
in Morgantown. As usual,
obscenities will be shouted angrily
by the two sides, and both teams will
display the hard—hitting, aggressive

football on which this area thrives. '

“Anytime you get West Virginia
and Pitt playing, you are going to
have all kinds of frantic fans and a
sellout,” West Virginia sports
information director Mike Ballweg
said. “The fact West Virginia is 4-0
makes the atmosphere wilderthan
it’s been in some time.” A V

Yet, the game has a deeper

Before the Don Nehlen era, Pitt
used to enjoy pounding the
Mountaineers into pulp, winning
with scores 44-3 in 1977 and 52-7 in
1978. The fourth-year coach at West
Virginia, however, has slowly
brought the program back to where
Bobby Bowden had it when he
vacated t_o the sunshine of Florida to
work some of his coaching magic.

' Nehlen has pulled some coaching
tricks out for West Virginia. Using

By MARK A. SINDLER

Upon stumbling across yel-
lowing archives recently, I
caught hold of a curious situa-
tion. FoJklQl;¢,hu$.iL1hat West
Virginia football coach Don
Nehlen comes across duller than
a blade that’s been slicing rocks.

Shoot, that was when a friend
presented him with one of those.
oversized birthday cakes. Only
this time, the l insides were
sweeter than corn syrup. Out
popped these statuesque dancing
girls. ,

Everyone had a grand ole
time. Everyone at the party, that
is, except Nehlen. He let out an.

' impassioned yawn.

Although there will be dancing
girls on the sidelines tomorrow at
Mountaineer Field, at much more
tumultuous situation will con-
front Nehlen ‘when Pitt resumes
its annual border war before
more than 57,000 spectators and
millions more watching on
national TV.

The Mountaineers, 4-0 with
national rankings at sixth (UPI)
and seventh (AP), are out to
solve the Pitt equation — the
answer" to which has eluded
WVU for seven of the last eight
years. ,

On the ‘line, ‘too, are serious E
bids for. the Eastfsi Lambert
Trophy, awarded each year -to
the region?s top finisher. All indi-
cations point to an undefeated
year for WVU with Heisman-
candidate Jeff Hostetler the do-.
it-all man.

What more could Nehlen want.
to get him pumped up? Convinc-
ing wins over Eastern powers ~

 
 

time has come for a new reign. Hail
the Mountaineers, perhaps.
There’s little doubt West Virginia

is deserving, judging from its 4-0 '

. record, including wins over
Maryland and Boston College, two

' solid teams. 1

 

This is the reason that the game,
commonly referred to for so many
years as “The Backyard Brawl,” is

(both on the road) behind him,
the fourth-year coach should be
on a natural high. V

Ho-hum, that is far from the
case.

Nehlen was asked to relay his
thoughts on this annual rivalry
that is slowly building, to erupt-
soon with gunpowder effects. V

“The only a people who get
excited are the fans,” Nehlen said
tersely. “We don‘t plan on pre-
paring any differently [for Pitt].
Just take it one game at a time.

“I hate to have to handle the
distractions." Let the, fans, the ‘
media work with it. Boston Col-
lege was _last week, Virginia Tech
is in two weeks and Pitt is this
week.

“You have to deal with that the
best you can.” _

And you think that kind of
talk nears the excitement _of
watching clay dry. Nehlen,imag-
ination lacking, was asked about
his placekicker Paul Woodside,
seven of nine in ﬁeld goals.

“He’s good,” said Nehlen.

Then, told’ to describe his pun-p
ter, Nehlen said this of Steve
Superick (with a 39.1 average):
“Some days he’s good, some days
he’s not so good.” .

Warning: Air filled with deafa
ening verbiage. .

All right, any rivalry inten-
tions on the side burner can now
be shoved into a closet. On with
this game — one which will once
again disclose whether or not the
Panthers have an offense.

That was not the casein Mary-
land last _weekend when sopho-
more John Congemi fell short of

‘l

more than that. ' _' 
It is .a battle between Pitt, oncethe .

boss of eastern football, a team.that .

does not have the same squad that"

dominated the wire polls the last

four years, and West Virginia, who‘ 
is ready to take the Panthers’ place. .

“In the past, it was Pitt and Penn
State "who _ dominated

it is of no worry_to Nehlen, "
though, who still indicates that
No. 1 pro draft-pick Dan Marinoi ‘
is taking snaps. "

“The guys they [Pitt] have 

aren’t too bad,” Nehlen said of
this first non-Marinot squad.’
“Their offense is capable of
exploding in your face just as
someone 'else’s might. _
“You never know if someone
like_ [fullback Marlon] Mclntyre
might rip one for 50 yards. And if

you .don’t have someone like 4  ' i

Marino, you'replace him with
someone else. 4

“It’s like [Boston College QB
Doug] Flutie. Seems he’s been '
there 30 years.” P ‘

Seems Nehlen’s stalwart, Jeff
Hostetler, could give Pitt similar
fits. The Holsopple, Pa. (popula-
tion a staggering 900), native has '
sent defensive secondaries
careening. Passing for over 200_
yards a game, Hostetler has com-..'
pleted 53 of 88 attempts for 806
yards. ' c

He is also"‘the Mountaineers’
fourth leading rusher — 82 yards
with‘ 29 carries.

“Jeff's a big, strong guy,” said .
Nehlen. “There’s no reason he
can’t run; it’ll make him_ kno
he’s in a great game.” a ’ g “_ ‘

No kidding. Pitthead coach »

F oge F azio just happens to be ’
entertaining similar thoughts
aimed at keeping his 2-1 record
from evening out. '

V “West Virginia is more physi-,
cal than they have ever been up
front,” F azio said. “This is the
most high-powered, well-,
balanced team we have faced in a ‘
long time.” ' '

revolving around sixth-ranked"

(UPI) West Virginia, Panther hope-
fuls must look to their seasoned
veterans.

, Enter four-year starter and All-
America candidate free safety

- Tommy Flynn.

, “This is the ‘Backyard Brawl,’ ”
Flynn said. “This is everything. The
records don't matter, the thing

about this game is that it’s West
_ Virginia.”

The thing about this kid, Tommy
Flynn, is that this type of game is his
forte.

1 He's been a big play performer for
Panther defenses since the days of
Hugh Green. Flvnn has been a star-

'ter since his first game as a freshman.
- More importantly, he has partici-

pated in each of the past three Back-
yard Brawls.

. “[This is} deﬁnitely the best West
Virginia team in the four years that I
have been here,” he said. “They’re a

’ very‘we1l-balanced team, but the key

to solving them is solving their quar-
t'erback,,J_eff Hostetler. It was the

same thing last_year. Last year, we '

were able to solve him.”

It will most likely be a bit tougher
this year, as is demonstrated by the
trouble that Boston College and
Maryland, the Mountaineers’ last

two foes, had tracking down the elu-.

sive Hostetler.

“He’s ‘ a tricky quarterback,"
Flynn said. “A lot of the time, you
can have him where you want him;

but somehow he gets away. He has
the ability to be very tough to tackle.
“We’rejust going to have to get as
many guys around him as we can.
Then we have to be able to sack him.
. We have to get our hands on him if
we are going to be able to contain
them [the West Virginia offense].”

Although the 1982 Panthers were
able not only to contain Hostetler
and practically dismantle him for
the season, this is a different Panther

team.

support from Flynn, it’s a crop of
youths who have snatched spots in
the defensive scheme for the
Panthers.

“The defenses over my four years
haven’t changed much at all,” he
said. “We are bigger this year than
any team since l’ve been here, but
other than that, it’s basically been
the names that have changed.”

The new names, Benson, Aldisert,
Dean, Shilken and Buzckowski, can
play.

“The most exciting thing about
this season is the younger guys,”
Flynn said. “Our-defense is improv-
ing every week. We still have eight
games that we want to win.”

Whether they win the remaining
eight is still under debate, but suc-
cess at any level from this team will
demand outstanding play from the
young, Flynn—led defense. . ,

' It has been this defense that has
given the Pitt offense the opportun-

. ity to put away its first three oppo-»

For Flynn, it was a new type of

Despite losing to West Liberty 5-4
yesterday at Trees Courts, Pitt
women’s tennis coach, George
Dieffenbach, was not unhappy with
his team’s performance.

“The match was closer than I
thought it would be," he said
afterward. “You’re looking at a big
scholarship school [West Liberty]. I
thought we played real well."

The match went down to the wire
and was decided on the last contest
played, number two doubles. West
Liberty’s Rhea Dumas and Beth
Thompson came back after losing
the first set to win 3-6, 6-3, 6-4;"

Pitt’s team of Jody Maitioli and
Kris Peckman rebounded from a 1-3
deficit in the final sets to take a 4-3
lead but fell short as darkness set
over the half-lit Pitt courts.

The Pitt News, Friday, September 30, 1983

  Netters Lose At Wire 5-4 

Dieffenbach noted that the
second set was the key that opened
the door for the visitors.

“After winning the first set, you
have to play twice as hard in the
second," he said. “lfyou let the other
team get back in, then it’s tough to
stop them. _

Pitt got strong support from its
top singles players as the number
one, two and three players all won.

Sophomores Peckman and Jodi
Levine, Nos. 3 and 2 respectively,
both scored straight set victories.
Peckman stopped Dumas 6-4, 6-1
while Levine bested Rita Taylor 6-4,
6-4. .

No. 1 player Miriam Goltz had a
somewhat tougher time.

After West Liberty’s Beth
Robinson won the second set 6-0 to
tie the match, Goltz responded with

3-3   Trouncing

Boaters’ Mark

The Pitt News, Friday, September 30, I983

Evens

By MIKE SIBERINI

The Pitt soccer team (4-4) went up
* against a young but highly skilled

‘ 2. Penn State team at University Park

Tuesday and came out on the short
end of an 8-3 decision.

“It was difficult to mark them,"

~ Coach Leo Bemis said. “They played
_a very ﬂuid, very skillful game. They
move the ball well long or short."
The Panthers had somewhat of a
new look as they started off the game
in a 4-4-2 alignment (four
defenders-four midfielders-two

 forwards) as opposed to their

normal 4-3-3. Brian Casey, who

normally plays stopper back, was
moved up to a midfield position.

“We made the move to get

» stronger defensively in the middle,”

Bemis said. “We wanted to force

them to go to the outside, but they .

had the capability of moving around
us very nicely.”
The strategy did not work, as the

I Panthers quickly found out.

“We wanted to hold the score

down early,” assistant coach Joe.

didn’t match up with ours. They
took advantage of that early.”

To support that fact, just check
the scoring chart. The Nittany Lions
tallied five times in the first 39
minutes. Pitt's lone first-half
counter was frosh Bob Howard's
first goal of the season 8:58 into the
game.

The second half was somewhat a
different story. The Panthers relied
solely on a freshman and sophomore
lineup and played Penn State tough,
allowing three goals while scoring a
pair —— one each from Howard and
Matt Becker. ”

If there was a bright spot for Pitt,
it was the play of the freshmen. The
young players scored all three goals
in addition to playing solidly
overall. Most notable were the goal
scorers, Howard and Becker.

“I was very glad to see Bob get on
the scoreboard,” Bemis said. “He's
starting to get into it. Bob is a big
fella, and it’s alot tougher for a big
guy to get into [match] shape.”

Howard came to the Panthers not
having played for his high school

the 17-year-old and under state club
champions. ‘

Becker, on the other hand, hails
from North Alleghney, a local high
school with a rich soccer history.

“Matt played exceptionally well,"
Bemis said. “He’s definitely
someone who is going to play more
and more."

He will get his chance as Pitt
travels. to West Virginia’ to take on
the Mountaineers after the football
game between the ‘two schools
Saturday.

“Th_ey’re a real good team,"
Luxbacher said of this weekend’s
opponents. “They’re a real
talent-laden team, such as Penn
State."

“They have a lot of people back
from last year’s team,” Bemis added.
“They like to keep the ball on the
ground, slide the ball through your
defense and have someone run onto
it.”

Luxbacher s_aid, “But their system
