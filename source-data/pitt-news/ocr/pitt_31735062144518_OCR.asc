Tuck Shop Mgr.

Assumes Duties

Miss Ruth Cramblet, manager of
the army cafeteria has been ap-
pointed manager of the student
food service in the red and blue
Tuck Shops. Along with her new
duties, ‘Miss Cramblet is also
teaching ’a freshman orientation
class.

After receiving her-bachelor of
arts degree at Allegheny college,
Miss Cramblet attended the Uni-
versity of Cciorado. She was fin-
ally awarded her master of arts
degree in English here at Pitt and
began teaching at McKeesport
high school.

During her summers Miss
‘Cramblet was employed as man-
ager of the Joseph Horne summer
camp for employees. Thus her
career in dietetics begans. She
took several courses in dietetics,
and after increased practical ex-
periencey was chosen assistant
manager of the army cafeteria
here. -

“It‘s like a fairy tale,” says Miss
Cramblet, “and even more enjoya-
ble. “She believes that managing
the Tuck Shops will be less com-
plicated than serving 7500 meals
as she did last winter. Miss Cram-
blet is anxious for student sugges-

tions for improvement of the
Tuck Shops. 1

Arthur To Resume Duties Here

As Assistant to Dean of Men

Lieut. Robert L. Arthur, United States Naval Reserve, will
return to campus this Friday to resume duties interrupted with

his enlistment in 1943.

During. his "stay at the University, Mr. Arthur was coun-
sellor to student activities in the office of the (lean of men, di-

rector of the University band and:

orchestra, and instructor in music
appreciation.

“Mr. Arthur will reorganize the
band and orchestra if it is deter-
mined practical and will have con-
siderable to do with the veterans’
program and act as veterans’ ad-
visor,” Theodore W. Biddle, dean
of men, said today and added, “His
return is a step in the direction of
student activities as we once knew
them and a step in our attempt to
offer veterans advice.”

If the band, and orchestra should
be reorganized, George Wright, C,
and A1 Pontiere, C, will act as
student officers.

Mr. Arthur left Pittsburgh on
December 20, 1943, and after his

indoctrination period at Quonset
R. 1., he was assigned to the U. S
Naval Air station at Gros Isle,
Michigan.

He received his BA. in musiz
from Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology, a B.A. in Arts and Letters
from Penn State in 1925, and his
M.A. from Penn State in 1933.
Teaching positions at South Hills
high school, Penn State, and West
Virginia university followed. He
is a member of the Pittsburgh Mu-
sical society, Phi Kappa Psi, and
before his induction into the Navy
was organist and choir director at
Brookline Boulevard Presbyterian
church.

Brotzman Praises

Students’ Work

In a letter to Chancellor John G.
Bowman, W. S. Brotzman, senior
meteorologist of the Pittsburgh
Weather bureau, -commended some
30 Pitt students for their assist-
ance in concluding “an important
war project.”

The work was sponsored coop-;
eratively by the United States De-
partment of Commerce,the Weath-
er bureau, and the United States
Air Forces, and in its broad scope
included editing and coding sev-
eral million weather observations.

Mr. Brotzman added in part
that “the time limit alone made
doubtful the possibility of recruit-
ing and training sufficient person-
nel within the deadline date es-
tablished. It is a sincere pleasure
for me to report that with the
services of a number of students
from the University of Pittsburgh,
our job was completed on time.”

,“I hope I pass my Customs exam and get a blue and gold
armband,” said a freshie as she straightened the green band
above her elbow.

“So do I,” joined her companion. “These green ones don ’t
match anything.” V

You may not yet know how much the Customs period of
orientation has meant and will mean to you. But you soon will.
And every day till you graduate, you’ll come to see more and
more the many ways it has helped.

When you ﬁrst came to Pitt a month or a summer ago, you
may have -expected some of the traditional hazing that just

naturally goes with being a frosh on an American campus. And
when, at the Green Armband ceremony, you saw the badge you
were to Wear on your arm, you probably said to yourself, “Oh,
oh, here it comes! Better beware the ground ﬂoor fountains
when I go back to school.” But then as the ﬁrst week went by,
you discovered that your fears were unfounded.

The Customs committee is organized not to remind you of
your newness to Pitt, but rather to erase that newness and orient

you more quickly to University life. Restrictions, such as'your

E‘.

. being asked not to use the ODK walk for instance may have

seemed irksome and petty at first; you’ll begin to discover,
shortly, why those rulings were made. It is because that walk

A means so much, to the student body and to Pitt that you are for-

bidden to use it now. We want that walk to be something spe-
cial to you, too, and the best way we know is to treat it in a
special way. The ﬁrst time you go down ODK, where are in-
scribed the names of some of the best that Pitt has put out,
there’ll be a thrill inside of you. And every day from then on——
When’ the walk is packed solid with crunchy snow, or in the
spring when the new green grass pushes up along the cracks, or
now when the dried brown leaves skitter raspingly across the
stones—-you’ll feel that thrill.

-So it is with all of the Customs requirements. They not

only help you to know the University, but also help you to feel it.

The ﬁnal phase of your Customs orientation is scheduled for
tomorrow and Friday. It’s a little late to tell you to start study-
ing for your exam. Most of you would not have to be told
anyway. But here’s a preview of how you ’ll feel when you put
that blue and gold armband on for the ﬁrst time. You’ll be
proud of your achievement and happy to be no longer “green.”
But most of all you '11 hold a love for Pitt that might have been
slower incoming without the help of the Customs program.

Heinz Chapel was given as a symbol of spiritual growth to
evaluate faith, courage, reverence and response to beauty. The
Friday_Chapel service is answering a need of students and fac-
ulty here at Pitt. Never in the student life of the University
has the necessity of service and meditation been more essential
to spiritual development. Therefore the expansion of the Fri-
day Chapel service and the daily organ recitals are a medium to
fulﬁll such a requirement. In addition, the application of free-
dom of thought and freedom of worship which these services
-afford should prompt us to turn to God with an act of joyful
thanksgiving.

One hundred and ﬁve students attended the Chapel service
on October 6, and one hundred and forty, on October 13. So
small a number is not a satisfactory representation of the entire
student body. University students should not postpone attend-
ing programs of spiritual and cultural values in this campus
center of musical and religious activities. You aren’t too busy
during these periods-—sitting in the Tuck Shops or around the
ﬁreplace in the Commons room. Bring your luncheon dates with
you to the Heinz Chapel.

A lot of students within the
past few weeks have asked why I
haven’t written about the dis-
charged veterans who are now at
Pitt. It’s taken me a little while
to get around to them, but that

isn’t because of their lack of im-
portance; it’s simplybecause I’ve
wanted a little time to observe
them, and observe I have. So
here’s the column you wanted.

The interest «of the students in
their fellow veteran classmates has
been amply displayed by the fact
that they wished this written.
There has been, as far as they and
I are concerned, no difﬁculty on
the part of the veterans to adjust
themselves to a school routine
after years in the service. Certain-
ly, there has been no d.emonstra-
tion on this campus as on that of
Stanﬂord, where the veterans
addled off into tight, unapproacha-
ble groups, feeling inferi-or or su-
perior to the rest of the student
body. It is hoped that the" atti-
tude of the Pitt boys and girls
have a lot to do with the easy, in-
formal atmosphere that now ex-
ists here, but certainly, the
adaptability of our veterans has

Is there a Thurber in the house?
I wish that irrepressible creator
of the wistful little connoisseur
who “knows all about art but
doesn’t know what he likes” were
here to write my column today. I
know he would have gone into a
perfect spasm of glee over the
antics of the visitors at the annual
Carnegie painting show opening
last Thursday evening. Paintings
may be interesting to look at; but
the people who look at paintings
are always interesting, especially
to such inveterate swivelnecks and
eavesdroppers as Mr. Thurber and
-—ahem-—mfself. \

There is never a dull minute at
a Carnegie press night, from the
instant you set foot upon the grand
staircase and are greeted by a re-
ﬁned tutti from Victor Saudek’s
Little Symphony until you have
watched the ﬁrst worshipper at
the altar of culture collect his
wraps at the improvised check
room and shuﬁle out into‘ the
Forbes street fog. The galleries
are thronged with the faithful, the
types familiar and fascinating.

There are the dour dowagers,

peering with invisible lorgnettes—
but visible disdain-—at anything
which might be attached by the
faintest breath of scandal to the
“modern” movement; the bored
husbands, yawning stealthily be-
hind their catalogues; the beauti-
fully manicured debutantes who
“dabble a little in oils.” There is
also the mousey little maiden lady,
dazed but grateful, paying her an-
nual duty-call on culture. You
can’t miss the Greenwich-Village-
fugitive type: the deﬁant haircut,
the aggressive intellectuality, the
aesthetically tubercular body un-
der its load of Mexican silver
jewelry. You feel thankful that
she has at least removed her smock
and cleaned thepaint from under
her ﬁngernails, but about her still
hangs an aura of damp studios
and egg-tempera.

Any such characters out of La
Boheme are not to be confused
with the successful artists, who
look like ordinary businessmen
and who are rather difﬁcult to sort
out from the rest of the crowd.
Those who have pictures in the
show, however, can usually be
found before them, ﬁshing for com-
pliments and eyeing the crowd for
prospective purchasers. Of course,
there is always the coldly superior
painter whose masterpiece has

been rejected’ by the jury and
whose heart is bitter against his
fellowmen, and the infant prodigy
who is dragged, bewildered and
sleepy, from room to room while
his proud rnamma explains to
everyone who will listen that his
latest opus is sure to make the
show next year.

Among the laymen are invari
able bores like the people who read
titles aloud and ladies who “don’t
know a thing about art, but I
know what I like”-—this remark
gotten off with a coy leer, intend-
ed to disguise its antique vintage.
The gossipers seem to be enjoying
themselves; they ignore the can-
vases for the more colorfully
painted scandal of the day. Some-
where in the‘ gallery is the per-
ennial wise-cracker, whose witty
comments and appropriate sub-ti-
tles enliven the company consid-
erably. And then there is always
one startling dress. This is a gar-
ment so striking, so overpowering
so blatantly in vogue, that its
wearer must perforce remain a
nonentity, overshadowed by the
magnificence of her gown.

And I must not foget to mention
the school-teachers, spongelike,
absorbing the atmosphere which is
to be wrung out later in class; the
oﬂicious relatives of the local ex-
hibitors, darting busily about, the
guards, invariably misinformed;
the gaping knot in front on the
Kuniyoshi; the director, looking
like a cat that has just swallowed
a hanary; the slightly inebriated
clubman who arrives late to take
his wife home.

As I say, I wish Thurber were
here. I know he could write a
much better article . . People
at art shows are fascinating. But
the pictures? Oh, I go back later
to look at them!

“All Pitt Men Members”

October 23 will begin the Young

Speakers Discuss

Brazil at Dinner

and Reverend Albert Roberts,
both of whom have lived in Bra-
zil, were speakers at a joint din-
ner meeting of Phi Alpha Theta
and the Pan—American club in the

was based on his past experience

that country and spent several
years there. Reverend Roberts,
who is stationed in Brazil and is
now on a visit to this country,
talked on “The Brazil I Know.”

Popular English Teacher

Wrote

F or Newspaper Once, Too!

So you have Miss Irvine for En

students preceding you, you want to know her better.

glish this year! And, like the Pitt
Besides cor-

recting stacks of themes, what does she do, what are her interests,

where is she from?
Miss Emily Irvine, assistant pr

from Mount Holyoke college, South Hadley,

ofessor of English, was graduated
Massachusetts, and

studied journalism at the University of Wisconsin, where she worked

part time on a newspaper for over two years.

Upon completion of

sity of Pittsburgh, she accepted a
teaching position at the University.

Miss Irvine’s teaching activities
now are related directly to the
war. When the war took all of
the men from the department of
journalism, the subject tempor-
arily was dropped from the cur-
riculum. Miss Irvine, employing
her study from Wisconsin and her
newspaper experience, took over
the class this semester.

Besides journalism and English,
Miss Irvine also has taught first
aid. Working with Mr. Miller, she
demonstrated first aid to the mili-
tary personnel stationed at Pitt
several semesters ago.

Even though she is occupied
with air raid warden duties and
other war interests, Miss Irvine

eagerly is looking forward to the
day that she may put these aside
and begin her private post-war
plans. When $200 round trip air-
plane jaunts to Europe become a
reality, Miss Irvine is going to see
how the war has changed things
since her ﬁrst trip.

But until then, she is content
to spend her free time puttering
around in the soil, picking ber-
ries, and making jelly. She en-
joys the theater and music, but,
oddly enough, Miss Irvine has no
great literary ambitions. She
writes book reviews and articles
for Pitt, edited by Mrs. Ag-pes
Starrett, and.someday Miss Irvine
would like to have essays and
short articles published in Harp-

€78.

Navy dive b0mbers—about to strike! In each rear cock-
pit rides a radio gunner — trusted protector of his pilot
and plane. His skill with radio and detection devices

permits his pilot to concentr

ate on ﬂying the plane and

blasting the objective. His marksmanship makes enemy

planes scarcer, brings V-Day

nearer.

Until that day comes, Western Electric’s major job
will be making huge quantities of radio and detection
devices. As our forces strike farther and farther into the

vast areas of the Paciﬁc, these

electronic weapons become

more important than ever. At Western Electric, many

college graduates—hoth men and women—are helping

to put these weapons in our ﬁghters’ hands.

Buy all the War Bonds you can — and keep them!

Engineers Follow

Fathers to Pitt

W. Anson Boothe and John
Ridinger, sophomore and fresh-
man, respectively, in the Engi-
neering school, are each a grand-
son of a Pitt alumnus. Three gen-
erations of Ridinger’s family en-
rolled in the Pitt School of En-
gineering as did two generations
of Boothe’s.

Ridinger’s father was graduated
in industrial engineering in 1923.
His grandfather, Charles W. Rid-
inger, a trustee of the University
for 20 years, was graduated in
electrical engineering in 1893.

Boothe’s father, Willis Boothe,

We bid Howdy Hop publicity
adieu.

Soph Hop will be the next dance
for you.

Plug one for the class of 1947
—don’t ask for another one un-
til the week before the dance.

Duo about campus is Midge
I-Iesselgesser and Ed Jaroszewski,
who looked very smooth together
on Saturday night. The Howdy
Hop was the ﬁrst public appear-
ance—off campus—— of a huge lot
of the sharp freshman women.
Among the most glamorous of the
glamorous was Peggy Dougherty.
(Long whistle.)

M-ore couples at the Billy Penn
were Judy Malone and Bill Mel-
lon, Bob George with Nancy Gra-
per; Dick Briney with Vivienne
Bartholy; Bill Mitchell and Ann
Follansbee.

Friday night’s PiKA openhouse
was very successful. Milt Anton-
opolus was home on furlough to
give it an extra clash. In-cidentally,
he did quite a bit of dashing again
Saturday night with Rose 0’Con-
ner, who is now training at Magee
hospital.

Since Saturday night Georgette
(alias Ginger) Zinsser has been
pinned to Jim Johns. It was a
closely guarded secret for all of
four or five hours, but news ﬁnal-
ly leaked out. Ya know, this col-
umn averages a Delt pinning
every week. (“But why didn’t you
tell me. You know I’m always
looking for news,” he said.
“Awwww,” she replied. So he
drew forth his little pearl-handled
revolver and shot her dead right
where she stood. Let that be a
lesson to all o-f you who withhold
news from this column.)

Biggest smile on campus belongs
to Ruth Fallon. She got word from
San Francisco via carrier pigeon
or Railway Express or perhaps
just the Bell ‘Telephone company
that Marine Sergeant Ralph Em-
erson is back home again from the
South Pacific. He’s to become a
pilot, and Ruth hasn’t seen him
for three years, so she’s waiting on
pins and cushions for his re-
turn, an event with a capital E.

Big week-ends past and pres-
ent. Last week it was Sammy
Round visiting the Kappas at Al-
legheny college, and this coming
week-end Mary Kay Toohill will
be representing Pitt with her
navy man at the Army-Navy
game.

And. speaking of football games,

and Dick Barnhart

Bob Davis. traveled all the way
to the Pitt-Army game only tobe
mistaken for a girl by the radio
announcer —— sort of a case of
“Beauty in the Beast!”

Glad — ta - see - ya - department:
Home from the Navy for the
weekend were Jim Maloney and
Ted Bloomer, who has received
his commission. Coming home
soon is Barbara Bush Benko -
you’ll be seeing her next week.

From George Wright himself
(by way of an underground re-
porters, of course) comes word
that it's romance with one of the
telephone operators. We hear that
he was singing—~or perhaps rasp-
ing, croaking, or squawking would
be better—over the phone to her
one day last week.

Second installment—Bill Humes
and Jean Walther are pinned. ~

Late installment—Dottie David-
son is pinned to Cy Plazak. '

Here’s a tip—Ask Rico Secan for
a squint at the picture of her new
man that she and all the Zetas are
campaigning for in the Tuck Shop.

Et al -— et al —

There’s “F urriner”

In YMCA Office

“I became a foreigner when I
left Texas,” says Mr. J. Frederick
Miller, secretary of the Young
Men’s Christian association at
Pitt. He was born there -and was
graduated from Texas Christian
university. Then he traveled. to
the University of Oklahoma to
serve as secretary of the YMCA.
His laststop before Pitt was Seat-
tle, Washington, where he was as-
sociate minister of the University
Christian church. The Dizzy Dean
of his high school team, Mr. Miller
used to drop them across the plate
to G. Moore, present outfielder for
the St. Louis Cards. “That,” he
smiles, “is the closest I came to
the Big League.”

However, his interest has shift-
ed lately from trick curves to
sleepy dolls, for he spends his
evenings playing with his daugh-
ter.

Even in his unﬁnished ofﬁce on
the eighth ﬂoor he “senses and
appreciates the friendly atmos-
phere at Pitt.” “Makes the work
with students more than a pleas-
ure,” he claims, and .adds in Texas
lingo, “Ah certainly think it’s
wonderful.”

EFFORT

To DEVELOP AND USE ways and means for saving time and effort
is a typical American trait. You see it among your classmates and
you exhibit the same shrewdness when you send your packages,
laundry and baggage, home and return, by Railway Express. The
pick-up and delivery at your door, and the quick forwarding by fast
trains, or by superspeed Air Express planes, is a shipping service
unique in American life. It has saved time and effort for generations

of college students.

These nation-wide facilities are now being utilized to their utmost
by the government, industry and the public. Y on can help Railway
Express to carry its share of this war-time load by doing three simple

things: Wrap your packages securely—ad-
,v.;_ dress them clearly—express them early. "A

 shipment started right is half-way there."

--Sweet‘ am! .£’ow-.‘25oam--

By Arnold Steinman

Many people come up and ask me “Where can I hear some good

jazz?”

“Is there any in Pittsburgh?”

Before we go any further let

us realize that what we call swing and what we call jazz are two

very different things.

The big bands such as Goodman and Dorsey

play swing. Their music is primarily for dancing. The little groups
(combos) of musicians that get together and jam, that improvise on
and around the given melody without beneﬁt of music, where every
man is a star in his own right, they are the musicians that play jazz

—a type of music that pays off‘

purely in enjoyment or (kicks) as
the hep cats say.

If you haven’t realized as yet
you prabably will, that this city in
proportion to its size and popula-
tion is one of the poorest musical
centers in the United States. Out
of town musicians actually shun
it. Many of the good Pittsburgh
musicians leave town as soon as
they possibly can. The name bands
seldom come into town and when
they do they never play more than
a one nighter here. Why, it’s only
once in a great whil.e that a really
ﬁrst rate band comes to the Stan-
ley anymore.

Now what are the reasons for
this? First of all Pittsburgh in
the last ten years or so has built
up a bad reputation among the
music business as being what mu-
sicians call a “square town.” It
seems as though all the people in
Pittsburgh want to hear is Guy
Lombardo, Sammy Kaye or any
of those other “mickey mouse”
bands. Wherever they play they
play to capacity crowds but let
Les Brown or any other good band
come into town and they can count
the gate receipts on both hands.

The second reason for Pittsburgh
musical unpopularity is that there
1ren’t more than two decent places
for a top ﬂight band to play in.
Cincinnati, Dayton, etc., all these
cities not even as big as Pitts-
burgh have big ballrooms with
good accoustics and beautiful dec-
orations and always two or three
name bands in town. It’s no won-
der that all the Pittsburgh boys

who made good in music had to
do it in another city.

As far as jazz in Pittsburgh is
concerned, ‘some good jazz is
played up on Center Ave. at the
Celebrity Club by Honey Boy and
his ﬁne combo, and downtown at
I-Iarry’s where Nick DeLuca plays
some ﬁne tenor sax. These are the
3nly.two places I have visited
lately and,‘ there maybe several
places I missed. Then there are
records. Almost anything by
Duke Ellington, Count Basie, or
Lionel Hampton will do. As to
the literary side, I strongly advise
the reading of “Young Man With
a Horn,” an exceptional book by
any standards.

For you Dinah Shore fans I
want to recommend “I’l1 Walk

provides the background.

Tommy Dorsey’s latest release is
“Boogie Woogie.” On the reverse

For something really zany in,
novelty numbers try “His Rocking

Here are the latest on “the

doing the vocal. Bing Crosby’;s
latest is his unforgettable rendi-

“Going My Way.” On the reverse

Mississippi Girl. Doris Lee of
New York, was

orable mention, which includes an
award of $400, went to Waldo
Peirce of New York for his ﬂower

S-oyer of New York won second
honorable mention and $300 for
interior, Young Woman in
Studio. Third honorable mention
with an award of $200 was given

"Fighting Illini” Invade Pitt

To Battle Battered Panthers

Visitors Boast

Speedy Attack

A battered but not unspirited
Pitt eleven returns to the stadium
gridiron this -Saturday to play

host to the “Fightin’ Illini” from
the University of Illinois. The vis-
itors coached by Ray Eliot, have
shown, in the four games they
have played thus far, that they
are a light and swift aggregation
with the ability to score and score
often.

The Illini have lost only to the
Purdue Boilermakers and this was
in a wild‘ and wooly game which
ended with a 35-19 s-core. A 26-26
tie was played with powerful
Great Lakes, Illinois deadlocking
the -count in the closing minutes
after the sailors overcame an
early lead piled up by the scrappy
gridsters. Last week they bowled
over a heavier Iowa team, 40-6,
showing the terriﬁc scoring punch
which the squad boasts.

Young Leads Attack

The leading point-maker for
the Illini is a little colored lad
who stretches only 5-foot—5 inches
in height and tips the scales at 160
pounds. This midget halfback is
Buddy Young. He teamed up with
Quarterback Don Greenwood to
provide most of the scoring against
Iowa last week. With these two in
the backﬁeld will be Fullba-ck
Billy Heiss and ‘Right Halfback
Paul Patterson. Certain to see
ball carrying duty is Eddie Bray,
a slippery little halfba-ck, who led
the, Big Ten in rushing last sea-
son, al-ong with Bill Daley of
Michigan. Both averaged 7.1 yards
per try. A possible starter at
quarterback is Bill Butkovich, last
-year letterman. Bill is a brother
of All-American Tony, one of the
nation’s leading scorers last sea-
son.

In the line will be Johnnie Orr
at left end; Lester Bingaman, the
heaviest man on the squad, tip-
ping 255 pounds, at left tackle;
Larry Forst, left guard; George
Bujan, center; Ralph Serpico,
right guard; Charles Smith, right
tackle; and Louis Agase at right
end. Agase is a brother of Illinois"
All-American Guard Alex Agase,
now a marine lieutenant.

battled the Army -Cadets last Sat-
urday. The veteran guard suffer-
ed a back injury as the Cats romp-
ed over little Bethany college sev-
eral weeks ago. As a result,
“Matt” will be -out for the re-
mainder of the season. Due to his
consistently outstanding perform-
ances in each game, it was the
opinion of practically every foot-
ball expert in this section that
“Matt” was sure-ﬁre to make the
All-American team this year. The
injury is a tough break for the
naval dent student who has been
a member of the Panthers for four
years.

Although the loss was a disas-
trous one for Coach Shaughnessy,
the T-master refuses to look for
sympathy. Instead, the grid men-
tor explains that “every coach
has his problems and his troubles.

and crying over them never helps.
The thing to do is just dig in and
work a little harder.

“We’ll just have to take the
next man and move him up, and
there will be other fellows behind
him. And once we Whittle down a
bit on our inexperience, we won’t
be making so many mistakes.”

One thing that Coach Shangh-
nessyiwants to make clear is that
despite the fact that Mattioli can
no longer help the team by play-
ing, Pitt will have “a ﬁghting
team on the -ﬁeld every Saturday
afternoon.”

As for Mattioli, well--everyone
will ~miss his sterling gridiron dis-
plays. He was always in there giv-

ing the best he had, and it is al- '

most a certainty that he will keep
his eye peeled on the players,

Basketball Team

Boasts Phantoms

Dr. Howard Clifford’ Carlson will

again assemble a basketball squad,
but it won’t be the “Tiny Tough-
lies” as of last year but the newly
christened “Phantoms.” The doc-
tor prescribed this name because
the boys are here for one practice
in a nice blue and gold court uni-
form and they show up for the
following practice in another kind
of a uniform, and they’re playing
on Uncle :Sam’s team.

According to Dr. Carlson. the
squad is shaping up very well.
Two experienced forwards were
on the squad, at the time this
was written, Nate Apple and Tay
Malarkey. Apple, a Navy dent stu-
dent, was one of the" regular
sharpshooters from last year’s
quintet. Malarkey, on the other
hand, was out most all of last
season due to injuries, but saw
plenty of action -on the 1942 team.
In the three practices held so far,
the veteran mentor has stressed
getting into proper shape. He holds
this just as important as learning

some rather famous names.

But first let’s turn to my forecasts
which some liken to “B0.”

ILLINOIS 33, PITT 20

Illinois tied Great Lakes. That’s
all brother, Illinois tied Great
Lakes. The Illini, with their “Stop-
Watch Backﬁeld,” may turn the
fray into a ﬁeld meet. However,
the speedsters from Champaign
are long on offense and short on
defense, so the Panthers should
rouse their rooters with a couple

When “Doc” Carlson sends his
blue and gold basketball array on
the floor this fall, he 'will have
several Allegheny-Kiski Valley
sharpshooters on his squad.

Topping the list is- “Dodo” Can-
terna, ace front-court man of an-
other blue and gold outﬁt, Free-
port. Canterna starred for the
Yellow-Jackets in his junior and
senior years when they traveled to
the Pitt pavilion for the WPIAL
playoffs. In his junior year, Can-
terna ﬁgured prominently in the
ﬁght for the Section V crown
when his court squad lost but one
tussle. This one was to Vandergrift
high school, a heart-breaker. Just
before he was graduated, he led
the Freeporters to an undisputed
title, only to lose out in the play-
ocs.

Joining Nate Apple of last year’s
Panther cagers is another Ford

Steve Pozzano, forward ace of the

men ‘did not go places in Section
I of the WPIAL race last year,
Pozzano did his best to give the
opponents a battle.

Tommy Ragan, first-string cen-

quintet, seems to have left the
blue and gold outﬁt on the limb
for the minute. He departed for
the service Monday morning.

 Know /1’/oe?

By Moe Spiegel, Sports Editor
Future Foes and Woes .

“What’s good is in the Army,

The rest will never harm me.”

If this is true, the Panthers have nothing to worry about for the
remainder of the season. Yes, nothing to worry about, just Illinois,.
Chatham Army Air Base, Ohio State, Indiana and Penn State.

It is quite evident, at this point, that Pitt is playing one of its
toughest schedules. Illinois, slated for the stadium turf this Satur-
day, has proved to be a high scoring eleven with a 40-6 triumph over
Iowa in its last start. Little is known about the Air Base eleven, but
as for the Ohio State Buckeyes, who needs to be told that the team
from Columbus is undefeated to date! Wisconsin, highly touted itself,
was knocked off by the Ohio Staters, 20-7, which just goes to show
that the Buckeyes are near the top of the gridiron list. As for Indiana,
just recall the passing of _Bob Hoerschemeyer week after week and
you realize at once that the Indians are going to be tough. The Lions
from Penn State close the schedule for the Panthers, as usual. And
though the Lions have ﬂashed a powerful team this year, season rec-
ords are tossed to the wind when the two squads of Jungle Cats clash.
What a schedule, what a lineup, what an outlook! ' ‘

And, as if the future weren’t black enough, the Panthers are
losing starplayers, either by injuries or service calls. You may be
saying to yourself that this can happen to any team. Well, it does
happen to all of them but Pitt can’t afford these losses as well as the

other elevens. This makes football all the more interesting, however, -

doesn’t it?
A Kick in the Pants . . .

Many of the students are wondering if the Panthers are an off-
and-on team. They polished off West Virginia in an easy manner, but
then the following week the Panthers came up with a terriﬁc belly-
ache from too many green Irish apples. The Cats got over this and
little Bethany college suffered a crushing defeat, but then the Army
mule came galloping along and planted a thunderous kick in the
pants for the locals. It’s our turn this week, going‘ by this kind of
ﬁguring. Gosh! What if Illinois doesn’t see it this way?

According to the radio announcer, as Pitt played Army, the

Panther running around on the ﬁeld was a girl. This wascertainly a E

surprise. I wonder if the announcer could have been wrong. Anyway,
the cadets let out a terriﬁc roar when the Panther was caught and
passed around the stands in the traditional Army methods—head over
head. ~

Betcha. Didn’t Know . . .

Did you know, dear reader, that your legs are smarter than your
arms? . . . Well, ’tis so, ’tis so. And if you won’t take my word for it,
then go up and see Dr. H. C. Carlson, Pitt’s cage coach for these last
23 years. The good doctor deluged me with ﬁgures to prove that the
legs are not only stronger than the upper limbs but that the legs are
also capable of learning -to do a difficult exercise faster and with
diminishing effort as time goes by than are the arms in a similar
length of time. This is all very interesting if you know what I am
talking about. If you don't know, then I will reveal the secret. I am
expounding on Dr. Carlson’s favorite subjects, “The Fatigue Curve
System.” I’ll tell more about this intriguing system sometime in the
future when I know exactly what I want to say -and how to say it.
The system is gaining much attention throughout the country, how-

ever, and a new magazine entitled “Aim—A Sports World Digest” is .

featuring an article about Dr. Carlson and his “Fatigue Curve” in its
November issue. The aim of the magazine is to aid physical ﬁtness
and there is no doubt that the local medic’s theories will receive more
recognition throughout the country. But, as I said before, a full ex-
planation on how the system can aid you will be revealed at a later
date.

...4wa‘4ac1z...

By Buddy Lenchner and Margie Long

If you’ve seen any of the frat
men in the Tuck shops this week,
perhaps you’ve noticed the an-
gelic looks on their faces. It’s not
that any of them have suddenly
decided to be model students; it’s
just that they’re all rehearsing for
that great event—rush week,
which begins tomorrow at 8:30
o’clock in the morning. There will
be more about that next week,
but now let’s see what is happen-
ing this week.

The Phi Delts had a candlelight
dance at their house on Friday
the thirteenth. Which all goes to
prove that these boys are not the
least bit superstitious.

The Phi Eps also deﬁed the fates
and had a barn dance in South
Park on the thirteenth. They were
celebrating the initiation of six
new men to the fraternity. They
are Leonard Walk, Melvin Blei-
berg, Marvin Silverblatt, Jack
Pincus, Irving Simon, and Lee
Caplin.

The PiKAs also initiated some
new men last week. The newest
brothers are Robert Harper and
William Stack.

The Pi Lams have just recently
completed redecorating t h e i r
In ‘addition to the redec-
orating, the Pi Lams have again
opened their kitchen, and are serv-

A ' ing meals daily.

Two brand new Sigma Chis are
now roaming the campus. The
new initiates are Kenneth Dunk-
erly and Louis Tierno. Incidently,
the Sigma Chis still haven’t chosen
their sweetheart. But if they
haven’t had enough applicants, it’s
not my fault.

Those big smiles and dancing
eyes that fraternity girls are shar-
ing have a meaning. But I’m in
the dark. People rush up to me
with, “Oh, we have great news!”
Pause. “We’ll tell you all abouut
it next week!” Pause. “Or maybe
the next!” Motto: read this column
next week and the next and the
next, or you’ll miss some big stor-
ies.

Now for what’s new.

Kappa Kappa Gamma cele-
brates their Founder’s Day tomor-
row evening with a banquet at
the Hotel Webster Hall. Their
new Tech chapter and alumnae are
invited. And here is more Kappa
news. Lorna Hazelton has left Pitt
to be married down in Texas.

Before meeting last Monday
the A E Phis gathered at the
apartment for the ﬁrst of their
monthly dinners.

After the game Saturday, yeah
Pitt-—the Phi Mus entertained their
visiting Beta Nu chapter of Beth-

any with a coke party at the-

ap_artment. ,

The Chi Os welcome a new
member, Unice Bowman, transfer
from Westminster Chi Omega
chapter.

A theater party at the Nixon to
see Ten Little Indians on Friday
evening is the next event on the
Phi Sig calendar. Last week-end
was a big one, too, with a weiner
roast on Friday night and a “rak-
ing party” Saturday afternoon.

The Knights of Columbus will
entertain the TPAs with a tea
dance at their Craig street home.

NE of the world's greatest bene-
factors was Einar Holboell,
Danish postal clerk.

Asheworked long hourssorting Christ-
mas mail, he thought of a way to put
it to work for humanity . . . and in 1904
started the sale of Christmas Seals
to combat tuberculosis. Introduced
in America in l907, the Seals have
helped cut the T.B. death rate 75%,
have helped save 4,000,000 Iivesl

Pre-Ministerial Students
Plan To Organize Here

A pre—ministerial club will be
organized at a meeting Monday,
October 16, from 12:30 to 1:20
o’clock at the YMCA office on the
eighth ﬂoor of the Cathedral of

and the sharing of a common ideal.

Meeting time and organization
will be discussed at this ﬁrst meet-
ing. All pre—ministerial students
and men of the University are
urged to attend.

The Transfer forum will be
held in room 151, Cathedral, today

Jobs Plentiful
In Social Field

Associated Collegiate Press—“We
could have placed ﬁve or six
times as many students in public
welfare positions this year as we
did,” said Dr. E. M. Sunley, head
of the department «of social work,
West Virginia university. “Never
has there been such an unpre-
cedented demand for profession-
ally prepared social workers.
Social workers are wanted as
staff members in medical and psy-
chiatric departments of our Army,
Navy and civilian hospitals, as

child welfare workers in our state —

departments of public welfare, as
interviewers in United States Em-
ployment Service -offices, as coun-
sellors for housing projects, as
children’s workers for juvenile
courts, as rehabilitation workers,
by war agencies, etc.”

Dr. Sunley further added, “In
recent months several new areas
of social work have developed.
Some of the most interesting of
these have included counseling
positions in industry, social case
work positions in labor unions,
case work jobs in department
stores, counseling positions in the
Federal agencies and case work
positions in war relocation pro-
grams. This is but a beginning;
new agencies and new services in
the post-war period, especially
services for our returning veter-
ans, will call for large numbers
of well prepared social workers.”
