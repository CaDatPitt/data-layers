underway yet, there has already
been an alleged violation of the elec-

“An official complaint is being

filed against her by the Elections ’

Committee office for violations of
the election code bylaws,” according
to Jim Brady, chairman of the Elec-
tions Committee.

Specifically, Eliason is being
charged with campaigning 12 days
prior to the permitted campaign
date, he said, by placing campaign
posters in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. There are also reports that pos-
ters were placed elsewhere around
campus and that some members .of
her campaign staff were wearing
campaign buttons. T

Student Union Clean-up T 

After‘ Weekend Events

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Despite a strict alcohol policy and
supervision by two house managers
and a student ativities administra-
tor, _alcohol in the William Pitt
Union during social events is a

. problem. _

“We’ve had incidents in the build-
ing,” Christine Chergi, assistant
director of student activities for
building management, said.‘

The problems are not limited to
alcohol, either, but include cigarette
burns in rugs and fire alarms being
pulled, which has happened four
times recent-ly.

“There are concerns any time we
have the building in use,” said Andy
Smith, director of student activities.
“They're minor problems.”

Although the alcohol policy ofthe
student union does not permit

drinks to be served at undergraduate

socials, beer cans have been found
after some dances, and some were
discovered shoved in the toilets in
the first floor men’s room-7 last
weekend.

“The groups don’t bring in alco-
hol,” Smith said. “In instances like

“We try to control that as much as
we can without searching people as’
they come through the door.”

Fourteen_ or 15 beer cans were
found in’ the Multipurpose Room
after a-social event this weekend, but
Smith said that keeping’ it in per-
spective with the number of people
at the event, it is not a serious prob
lem. *

During his work as assistant '
director for evening_management,_ 

“The groups don't
bring in alcohol-
...people sneak
alcohol in. "

«Dr. Ronald Stanko, Spreadingthe Medical Word

.1

By LESLIE ROSS

Dr. Ronald Stanko does not
watch television very often because
he believes most media presenta-
tions do not tell the public what they
need to hear. Instead, he believes
they report news as an impression-
building medium.

“Most people get their nutritional <

, information from Cosmopolitan
-and Redbook and the local news,
and it cannot be accurate,” said
Stanko.

Stanko, a clinical nutritionist at
. Monteﬁoreand the university hos-
pitals, is a guest speaker 'on WTAE
television twice a week. He appears
on the Jack Bogut Show every Wed-
nesday morning and on the 6 p.m.
evening news that same night about
medical issues that he believes war-
rant public concern.

The main reason he agreed to
speak on television was to present
the ‘public with medical information
that is accurate. “Many times, what
reaches the public are studies that
bare no medical credibility,” he said.
It is therefore up to trained experts
to tell the public what is valid and
what is not, said Stanko.

Stanko began his undergraduate
work at Carnegie-Mellon University

of Nutrition and is director of the
Alcohol Research Center. He is also
the associate chief of nutrition servi-
4 ces for Montefiore Hospital.

Besides his clinical and television
work, much of Stanko’s time is spent
on research. ‘

“Research is the most important
thing here at Pitt for making contri-
butions to the advancement of
science,” Stanko said. Presently,
two major problems, in nutrition

' require most of his research time. He

has been working on two projects:
the Prevention of Alcohol Induced
Liver Disease (since 1973) and
Chemical Intervention to Inhibit
Weight Gain (since 1977).

As part of his research into the
alcohol-induced liver diseases,
Stanko said that with college stu-
dents, drinking begins as an experi-
ment as the student _is finally
independent of his parents and is
away from home for the first time.
When they begin drinking, their liv-
ers become abnormal‘, and research
has shown that fatty deposits
develop in their livers.

If the drinking continues at a
steady rate, these fatty deposits may
not go away, leading to irreversible
liver diseases. It is at this point that

these persons cannot be helped by
his research.

But his research can “help those
students who drink a little bit too
much," Stanko said. “We can pre-

‘Many times, what

are studies. that bear

no m.edical credibility’  

because their intake has not yet de-
stroyed their livers."

Chemical intervention to‘ inhibit
weight" gain is the other problem
Stanko is researching. Here, like the
other study,‘ rats are used where an

experiment group takes the medi-'

cine, while a control group does not.

~ To date, these studies have pro-
moted his research.

“A cure is not yet available, and
when it is, it will be made available
to humans," Stanko said.

As the Channel 4 television
camera focuses on Stanko, all is
quiet in the studio as he begins his
report. “This is Dr. Ronald Stanko

and trying to improve it.

we give out a booklet explaining
the whole budgeting process.
The main emphasis is on trying
to getsome input so we don’t

Smith is considering making
meetings between organizational
heads and liaisons mandatory.

“Things go so much better
when they work with a liaison,”
he said. “Some groups might
have very small budgets, but I
think they can stop in for five
minutes. A lot of their problems
can be corrected early.”

By WES COTTER

Columbus Day holds many emo-

tions for the people of Italy, and this
year, anger will be one ofthem when

I12 American cruise missiles are

‘ deployed in Comiso, Sicily.

Sister Rosalinda Ramirez was the

guest speakerlast night when the
Arms Race Study Group, in con-
junction with the Oakland Women’s
Center and the Thomas Merton
Center, held a lecture and slide show
presenting Italian resistance to mis-
sile installation.

Ramirez is a Catholic missionary

from Puerto Rico who has been bat-
tling for peace since she was 15.
Ramirez works with U.S. Friends of
Comiso, an organization formed -
through the Catholic clergy.
Ramirez has spent the last two
months in Italy and has returned to
America for a short stay to report on
her activities. '

Ramirez said in an interview that

her main purpose in Italy is to give
reports and show American solidar-
ity to the Italians.

“Italy’s peace movement is rapidly
coming of age; this showed on this
Sept. 26 and 27,” she said.

On those dates, Italians blocked
the entrance to the military base in
Comiso. She explained that the act
was initiated by an international
group against cruise missiles, and
she brought media coverage and
documented the strong show or re-
sistance.

 

and was very impressed with the
quality of non-violence practiced by
the people there,” Ramirez said.

The lecture, which was -presented
last night, started off with an intro-
duction by Harold Winter, a West
German who presented an inside
view_ofa peace march in Comiso last
winter.

Ramirez then spoke, and she took
a very hard line against the missile

installation. She said that after being
chased, gassed and everything else
that happens to resistance groups,
she wasn’t afraid to go to Italy.

Ramirez said, “In the South.

Mediterranean theater, cruise mis-
siles have an almost useless range
into the Soviet Union, but they do

reach both Africa and the Middle _

East.”

I-Ier reasoning about the Ameri- E

can missile placement concerns the
reach these missiles would have into
both the Third World and important
trade centers.

“World «War III has already
begun; it started when World War II
ended and the struggle for Third
World and first-strike control
started,” she said. She also believes
that the missiles are being placed
where they are because the industrial
northern areas ofltaly look down on
Sicily and don’t care how it feels
about them. ’

Ramirez predicted that when the
missiles are installed on Columbus
Day, it will be day for which peace
advocates in Italy will be ready.

, Watt Fans?

 

’Opini0n    

It’s finally that time. Time for The Pitt News to
jump on the James Watt bandwagon.

Mr. Watt ﬁnally found the good sense to
resign. He’s insulted native Americans, minori-

ties of all kinds,‘ the handicapped, both political -
- parties and every one else with his attempts at

_being humourous. ,

, Not only was he a bad representative of the
federal government and the Reagan Administra-
tion, but many people wonder about his abilities
as Secretary of the Interior. Environmentalists
groaned through Watt’s‘ three-year tenure
because of his policies. But some politicians, and
especially President Reagan, agreed with and
supported his policies. _

There will be some Americans, however, that
will miss Watt; they are the journalists of the
country. i _

Since being appointed to the Reagan Cabinet,
Watt -has been a subject that could almost be

V considered fun by Washington journalists’stand-

ards. He was constantly in the center of controv-
ersy, always putting his foot in his mouth and,
above all, he had an air of spontaneity. When he
called a press conference, the Washington press

--corps would never know what to expect from

him.

On top of all that, he was also a different ‘sort of '

politician than the rest in Washington. Although
it can be said with a bit of truth that there are
politicians with questionable ethics on Capitol
Hill, they are usuallyable to cover their tracks.
Watt was not like that. Hesaid what was on his
mind and was not worried about whom he
. offended, although he usually did apologize after
making some of his comments.
We are not condoning his “honesty” or the way
"he aired his likes and dislikes’; we think the things
that he said were unforgivable and unbecoming
of a cabinet member. - j '
V Yet, Watt was almost refreshing in a way —
because he did not try to cover up his thoughts to
live up to the ideal of the great American politi-
cian. To journalists used to covering the rhetoric
of Washington politicians, he had to have been a
welcome change.
Finally, Watt will also be missed by the editor-

' ial ‘cartoonists of the country. Watt himself

admitted that he was a favorite because of his
facial characteristics. Those, in conjunction with
thefoolish things he always said, made him a
cartoonists’ delight. »

Although most Americans won’t miss James‘

Watt, he might like to know that some people
found him interesting.

, Dear Editor:

On behalf of the Pitt football
staff and team, I want to express
my appreciation to the students
and all Pitt fans for their exhila-
rating support at the Florida
State game. The chemistry that
was created between the team
and the fans sent chills up my ~

spine, and I’m sure it had the
same effect on others.

— As you pointed out in your
very positive editorial, “Satur-
day Pitt students were at their
best.” There is‘ no question that
their vocal support was an
important stimulus to their team,
and we are confident that this

support will-grow as the season
progresses. .

The Panthers have always
been proud to represent their
university and never moreso
than last Saturday. ‘

Let Pitt Come

By TAMARA CHOBANY

“If you can't come to Pitt, let Pitt
come to you.“ This is what the Uni-
versity External Studies Program
does. The program is available to
those who can not attend class on a
daily basis, and it allows those who
have work or family responsibilities
to earn the same- college credit as
students enrolled in on-campus
classes. ‘

Well-known Pitt graduate - Dan
Marine is taking advantage of" the
program to get extra credits while
quarterbacking for the Miami
Dolphins. '

Director Michael Spring said that
instead of going to class on a weekly
basis, you attend three workshops.
The workshops.are held about one

week apart at the beginning, middle 

and end of the term.

Each workshop is three hours
long and is scheduled on Saturday
morning or afternoon. They are usu-
ally held on the third floor of the
Cathedral.

According to Spring, this is one  1.
big advantage for the professor 

because he can create the course the
way he wants it to be.
The grade you receive through the

program is based upon the instruc- _ ’

choose when and where to take the
test.

This is one disadvantage, Spring ,
said, because students are not moti- ,

Bailey Complements Mac  ttackf,

By CHARLIE O'l-l'A’RA

A year ago, Pitt football fans had ’

their eyes opened by the perfor-
mance of a sophomore fullback
named Marlon _McIntyre, who
appeared to'have nailed down that
spot for the remainder of his tenure
at Pitt.

But with the 1983 season, Moln-
tyre has been joined by an equal,
fourth-year junior.Marc Bailey.

Well, who is he —. aside from the
name that we have heard when he
scored Pitt touchdowns of late or

‘gained yardage in large chunks

behind the ever-consistent Pitt inte-
rior line? More importantly, where
was he last season when Mclntyre
was making waves?

The 1982 season was one of major
disappointment for Bailey who had
to sit out for its balance due to
injury. He was redshirted (forfeited
season competition without the loss
of eligibility) for medical reasons.

“It was a tough season,”the native
of King of Prussia, Pa. and Upper
Merion High Schoolsaid. “I was
really down, but the guys kept pick-
ing me up. For as much as I was
down, though, there were some posi-
tive things.

“I think I learned a great deal
from watching Marlon and [full-
back] Bill Beach. The most impor-
tant thing for me, was that I kept my
confidence. I never stopped believ-
ing ifl had the chance that I could
take advantage of it.”

“He isjust now beginning to grow
into fullback size,” running back
coach, Andy Urbanic said. “Like

wondering where the time has gone,
others, like Judy Young, setter and
outside hitter for the Pitt volleyball
team, are busy ﬁlling it.

“I go to class, study, take‘ the test
and see what happens," Young said.
Ah, so that’s the secret to maintain-

ing a 3.6 QPA in the demanding field
of’ pharmacy. Well, not entirely.

“I do as much as I can,”thejunior
setter explained. “I enjoy a chal-

& lenge, volleyball and the classes I‘m

taking. It takes a lot oftime, and you
have to have the discipline to study.”
Young added, “I don’t have a lot of
social life.” .

Volleyball coach Shelton Collier
praised Young, who was a 1982 Aca-

demic All-America and will proba-

bly receive the honor this season.
“To me, Judy is the ideal student-
athlete,” the coach said.

A I981 graduate of Conneaut
Lake High School, Young stands 5-
7, considered short by national vol-
leyball standards for hitters.
However, Collier maintains that this
is not a problem. “Her height is
regarded, in national volleyball
terms, as too short for a spiker,” the

. fourth year coach said. “But Judy is

extremely strong, with a 28-inch ver-
tical jump.
respected as an outstanding left-side
hitter.” .

According to Collier, Young ‘has
improved tremendously since I979,
when as a sophomore in high school,
she went along with teammate
Marcy Leeks to try out for the
Mideast Three Rivers Junior Olym-
pic team. “Judy had very little in the

way of volleyball skills but a lot of-

desire, which the coaches saw, so
they kept her.” Collier said.

The coach believes Young‘s
improvement resulted from her
selection to the Mideast team and
other tournaments in which she
played to work on her skills over the
summer. So great was her improve-
ment that the spiker was Pitt‘s No. I
recruit in I981. _ _

Young was a part-time starter her
freshman year, strictly as a hitter.

“Around the middle ofthe season,
Judy became a starter," Collier said.
“She has been a starter and one of

ou-r most productive players ever.
. since.” the coach remarked- The .

The Pitt News, Wednesday, October l2,_ii,!i.,933.

Marlon Mclntyre, Marc has spent
the summer in the weight room. He
can see the light at the end of the
tunnel. He"s added some weightand
should be a solid player for us.”

“Right now I’m just happy play-
ing and contributing,” Bailey said.
“I feel comfortable with the offense.
I think I’m improving with an
improving team. It's_ great to be a
part,’ especially when you know
you’re being counted on.”

Back in 1981, when Bailey was a
sophomore both academically-and
athletically, he saw some action but
it was not until the games were well
in hand. '

“I got to play but it was nothing
like now.”_ ‘

Not at all. As a sophomore, he
carried the ball 14 times and finished

‘ with 71 yards, a 5.1 average per

carry. But against what? The third or
fourth strings or beaten-up first
strings that were mere prey for the
powerful I981 Panthers who culmi-

nated their season with a Sugar

Bowl victory, little of Bailey’s doing.
In 1983, on the other hand, in
earning Pitt's hard fought 3-2 mark,
Bailey has had his influence felt.
.His current ranking among the
offensive producers is "definitely
noteworthy. He is second — 186
yards rushing on 38 carries, a 4.9 per
carry average —- behind his partner
Mclntyre, who has rushed for 212
yards on 43 carries and,an identical
4.9 average per carry.
On the receiving end of the
offense, Bailey has latched ontn sis:

With the tough stretch .of._the sea’-
son over, Bailey maintains a consist"-
ent attitude. -  .  _

“I believe we can finish with a very;
good record. But we're just taking;
them [the games] one at aitime." 3.‘ '‘

Before Bailey chosethe Panthers;
he was sought after by just about,-

1Harriers Blitzed In wvu Double   Dual 

 By Cl-IARLIE O'HARA

The Pitt men’s cross country team
ran into stiff competition on Satur-
day as they were handily defeated by
two of the top teams in the east in a
double dual meet held at Morgan-,
town, W.Va.

The Mountaineers eased past the
Panthers with a 16-47 score and
Ohio University had no trouble
either with an 1844 victory.

“They’re both pretty good teams,”
Pitt coach‘ John Vasvary said. “West
V irginia’s only loss before Saturday
was to Ohio, and they [W.V.U.] cer-
tainly made up for the earlier loss.
We knew what kind of team West
Virginia had going into the meet
because they had placed five guys

- The Pitt News, Wednesday,‘ October 12, 1983

ahead of Penn State’s number one

man [in a meet earlier in the
season].“

For the Panthers, there can be but
one bright spot. They did _not per-
form up to their capabilities, but for-
tunately there are still a few meets
left to show what they have.

Actually, they probably made
their two opponents appear a lot
better than they really are.

“Our guys just didn’t accept the
challenge,” Vasvary said. “We knew
the teams that we were running
would be tough, but that's no
excuse." ‘

Leading the cause for the Panther
harriers was senior Todd Colas who
placed seventh, completing the five-

mile race in a time of 26:27,just l9 _

seconds behind the winner. -Dave

Mirth of Ohio (26:08), and 10
seconds behind runner-up Steve
Taylor of West Virginia (26:17).
“Todd was within striking dis-
tance,” Vasvary said. “He just
couldn’t adjust to the downhills. He
was right‘ there [among the leaders]
on the uphills and flat areas, [but]
was getting passed on the
downhills.”

As for the other Panther scorers
(the top five from each team score
the points), freshman John Thomas
placed l5th (27:44), freshman Mike
Doll was 23rd (28:49), junior
Mickey Rihtarchik ﬁnished 24th
(28:54) and senior Tom Bailey was
25th (28:57). I

The loss and the margin of defeat
was bad enough, but the injury to
senior Bill Moorhead sustained dur-

ing the race was, in this case, salt for
the wounds.

“Bill injured his right heel while
running uphill,” Vasvary said. “He
wanted to finish the race but it
would have been a mistake.”

Whether or not Moorhead will be
back for the Big East meet on Oct.
22, Vasvary could not determine.

The times from Saturday's meet
were considerably down from the
meet with Robert Morris and
Duquesne two weeks ago, but_ that
can be attributed to a much more
demanding course.

, “At Robert Morris, it wasibasi- ,

cally flat,” Vasvary said. “At West

-Virginia, on the other hand, we had

to battle the hills. It was quite a
difference.”

/

Another factor that could have
played a role in the Panthers’ down-
fall is that their training is geared
toward the Big East conference
championship race,‘ which is flat

, with some downhills.

The Boston College course is a
fast one. Last year, the leaders went
out in the first half mile in 1:58 (for
non-cross country buffs, that's fast).

“We do little to no hill work,”
Vasvary said. “Our main concern for
the season is performing well at the
Big East meet.

“And if Saturday is any indication
of what the Big East is going to be
like, then we’re in a lot of trouble.

“Overall, it was a mediocre run-
ning performance as well as a medio-
cre coaching job.”

continued from page eleven
team placed ninth at the AIAW

_ national Championships.

The following summer, 1982,

Young was selected as first alternate, . .

to the East team at the National
Sports Festival, as well as the Ohio

‘Valley All-Star squad that travelled.

to Santa Barbara, Calif., to ﬁnish
third. Collier asserts that his set-
ter/spiker was aprimary player
there.

As a sophomore, the Conneaut

alumnus was voted All-America at
the AAU Junior Olympic tourna-
ment, leading the team to a second
place finish nationally. ‘Young spent

part of the summer in Colorado .

Springs after being selected to the
first team East at the Sports Festi-
val. Collier maintains that Young
was a major factor in Pitt’s win at the

‘I Big East championships and the

NCAAS last year.

During her first two seasons,
Young was used primarily as a
spiker. But this season, Collier
decided to give her additional duties
as a setter, alongside junior setter
Cathy Rupp.

“Judy continues to be an out-
standing hitter for our team and is
learning the setting very well,” the
coach said. “She has a great deal of
respect from her teammates, who
voted her captain.”

Asked about her individual goals,

captain Young responded,“I don’t
compare myself with my teammates.
I think of the overall team’s goals. I
like to go on a day-to-day basis —
give myself a goal for the day to
improve a certain aspect of my
game."
“ Someone once stated that playing
sports is as much psychology as it is
athletic prowess. According to
Young, coach Collier greatly
emphasized the mental aspects of
volleyball, which helps the team cap-
tain to concentrate.

“[Collier] stresses mental concen-
tration,” the setter said. “I am more
in tune with the mental aspect of the
game, andathe team is more in tune
with it.”

Young has become a finely-tuned
volleyball player, which she credits

her coach with. “He believes I can do ~

it, and his confidence gives me confi-
dence,” she maintained. “He gives
you a specific role to perform, and it
really helps.” ‘

Collier is confident not only of
Young’s setting and hitting capabili-
ties, but of her leadership as well. “If
we are to succeed at the national
level —- which is our goal —— Judy
will have to take us there with her
spiking, setting, and leadership,” he
said. “She has a great deal of respon-
sibility_for this year’s’team.”

Collier. continued, “This year,
Judy had been struggling with an
injured ankle, which has limited her.
Last weekend at the Purdue Classic,
she was not fully recovered and

' experienced some pain.”

The spikers had a bruising week-

drop allthree matches in attempting
to burn a top-ten team. But it was
nothing to hang heads about. The
unranked Pantherstgave two-of the
three teams, Purdue (7) and Ken-
tucky (5), five grueling games.
Against Nebraska, however, Pitt fell
in three games.

“We got a little overconfident,"
Young said. An unranked team suf-

playing the sixth—ranked team in the

team’s level of performance against
the trio of top-ranked teams was an
encouraging sign.

“Based onthe weekend, I think we

could have "beaten them." ‘
As far as the difference between
this year’s squad and the previous
one, Young replied, “I think we’re
closer this year, and we don't have a

Netters Dropped By IUP 5-4 A

By scorr DELLETT

The main objective of the Lady
Panther tennis team was to ﬁnish
above the .500 level — a lofty level
for a squad that lost three of its top
six players to graduation.

Pitt has managed to compile a 4-3
record, despite a loss last Friday to
Indiana University of Pennsylvania
5-4. The schedule is not in the Lady
Panthers’ favor; they have away
matches with Allegheny today and
West Virginia tomorrow.

“We're a much different team
from a year ago," head coach
George Dieffenbach said. “We have
been keeping the ball in play with the
use of top spin on the ball.

“We’re working on a new physical
mechanism that we haven‘t had this
year."

Indiana had three more matches
played compared to Pitt, yet the
team has improved over the season.
Still, there are weaknesses which
need solutions if Pitt is to pull off an
upset or two in the future.

The match against Indiana is a
prime example of where the Lady
Panthers need help. Losses in singles
by Miriam Goltz,-Kris Peckman,
Jodi Mattiloi and Rhonda Gibbs
put the Lady Panthers in a postion

where they had to sweep in doubles. *

Pitt almost pulled the match out, but
aloss by the No. 2 doubles team of
Peckman and Mattioli halted a
near-miracle, dropping a 6-3, 6-3
decision to the Indiana doubles team
of Lori Ruppen and Sue Smidlein.

Along with the doubles’ play,
Dieffenbach is pleased with the per-
formance by the the top two single

players, especially Jody Levine, who
raised her singles record to 6-! this
season with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over
Peggy Walkush.

“As a team, our strengths are
Miriam Goltz and Levine at singles
and as a team the doubles,” he said.
“Levine has been our most consist-
ent performer.”

Consistency is going to be needed
in the next two matc-hes if Pitt
expects to remain competitive.

“Allegheny is probably going to

be a stronger team than Indiana,”
Dieffenbach said. “Last year, we
beat them [Allegheny] 6-3, but we
also beat Indiana.”

The match Thursday with the
Lady Mountaineers .does not figure
to be any easier, although Pitt came
close to beating West Virginia in
what Dieffenbach called. “the grea-
test match in Lady Panther tennis
history.” ‘

“They could possibly be the best
team we face all year,” he said.

Besides finishing even, Dieffenb-
ach would like a higher finish in the

Big East tournament. 

“Last year, in the Big East we ﬁn-
ished ninth out of nine schools,” be
said. “We hope to peak for the Big
East. Our long-term goal is to utilize
our experience and finish out of last.

“At the Big East, we definitely
have to get off to a better start than
we did against Indiana.”

— 0lym- Yugo Connection...

The Pittsburgh Spirit strength-
ened their roster last week with the
acquisition of United States Olym-
pic star Kevin Maher and Yugoslav-
ian standout Drago Dumbnvic.

Maher, 22, is a 5-10, 155-lb. All-
Arnerica defender from Yale and is
the first player in Spirit history to

~ play for the team as an amateur. By

retaining his amateur status, Maher, .
who has played on U.S. Olympic
developmental squads for the past
five years, will be able to represent
the U.S. in the 1984 Summer Games
at Los Angeles.

Maher was a second-team for-
ward at Yale in l98l-82 and a first-
team All-America in 1982-83 and
second-team in 1981-82. He scored
32 goals during his collegiate career,
while graduating with high honors
with a biology degree last May.

He also represented the U.S.
Olympic squad during the 1983
President’s Cup in Seoul, Korea.
The Guilford, Ct. native also nabbed
high school All-America honors,
scoring 72 career goals in the
process. , «
aher will primarily see action at
his Olympic position of defender

. with’the Spirit, but will also be util-

ized at forward.

The Spirit gave another boost to
their offense by signing the 5-8, l42-
lb. Dumbovic to a one-year con-
tract, plus an option year.

Dumbovic, 23, is a prolific scorer
with exceptionally quick feet and a
dangerous shot. He’ has spent the

‘ast five years with perennial power
ynamo Zagreb of his native
Yugoslavia.

He scored the winning goal in
leading Dynamo to_ the Yugoslavian
Cup championship in 1980 before
l00,000 people at Red Star'Stadi‘um
in Belgrade. He also led Dynamo to
the 1982 Yugoslavian League cham-
pionship, scoring in the ﬁnal, and a
second-place ﬁnish in the 1982 cup.

In other acitivity, the Spirit has 23
players vying for 20 spots for the
l983-84 Major Indoor Soccer
League season. Seven off-season
acquisitiohs, including goalkeeper
Peter Mowlik; defenders Maherland
Bob Vasmaer; midfielder Luis
Alberto; and forwards Dumbovic,
Dave Hoggan, Zcee Kapka and Ian
Sybis; plus free agent defender
Glenn Davis, have created a lot of
competition at every position.

Overcooked Rice....
Rice football coach, Ray Alborn,

said it was inevitable he was going to ’

be fired, so rather than foster a “bad
scene,7’ he resigned under pressure
from alumni.

In a farewell news conference yes-

_f?\__tCI'day, the likeable coach defended
" ‘the school’s alumni and the adminis-

tration despite hard feelings over

being forced to quit because of

mounting losses on the field.
School sources say Alborn

' worked out a deal to relinquish the

last year of his contract, which runs
through the 1984 season, so that his
assistants would be paid through
May 1984, instead of being setfree in
December.

Bird Tutor....

,;,r One time catcher and veteran
‘“"‘coach, Mike Roarke, is the new

pitching coach of the St. Louis

Hub Kittle, who resigned after three
years as pitching coach. .
Kittle will work as a scout and
special minor league instructor for

. the Cardinals next year.

Serious Fo0d....
Sen. Arlen -Specter (Pa.) has

 wagered three of his wife’s gourmet
pies against three giant Baltimore’

crabs on the outcome of the .World
Series between the Baltimore Ori-
oles and Philadelphia Phillies.

Specter made the bet two days ago _

' with Sen. Charles Mathias (Mdi.).

The Phillies say nearly 15,000
tickets are available for the three
World Series games to be played in
Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium. -

y A spokesman said about 5000'
tickets "remain for each home game
Friday night, Saturday and Sunday.

Shot Down....

Philadelphia Flyer right winger,
