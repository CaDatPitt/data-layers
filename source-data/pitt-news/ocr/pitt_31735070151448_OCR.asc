his parents made for a funny story.

O’Brien,a sophomore majoring in
German and Russian, will probably re-
count his story several times this week
as part of Rainbow Alliance’s celebration
of National Coming Out Week.

O’Brien came out to his parents as a

freshman in high school when his iTunes '

purchase history revealedthat he’d pur-
chased a dating app.
‘ “Is there something you want to tell
me?” O’Brien recalled his father asking.
“My parents are really accepting,”
O’Brien said. “It was just a really embar-
rassing, really funny way of coming out.”
Student organizations will hold sev-
eral events during National Coming Out
Week, which starts today and will lead
up to National Coming Out Day on Fri-
day. Throughout the week, the events
will encompass issues of social equal-
ity, including coming out and feeling
comfortable with one’s sexuality.
The Rainbow Alliance will host a
Speak Out event at 8:45 p.m. Thursday

Ryan Tedder of One Republic struck the
final chord on the piano with his head,
signaling the end to his band’s rendi-
tion of Kanye West’s “Gold Digger.”
Tedder, the pop-rock band’s lead
vocalist, led his fellow members in a
combination of cover songs and their

own songs as the headliner perfor-
mance for Pitt’s Fall Fest.

The annual Fall Fest took place Sun-
day between 1 and 5 p.m. on Bigelow
Boulevard. Pitt Police blockaded the
street to create space for an estimat-
ed 3,000 attendees who came out to
watch live concerts and pick up some
freebies. The event, organized by the
Pitt Program Council, featured live

performances by One Republic and stu-
dent band Acaica Street, who opened
after winning this fall’s Battle of the
Bands. _

One Republic performers, dressed

in black and sporting sunglasses, took

the stage at 3 p.m. The band, energized

The Pitt News regrets these errors.

In an article titled, “The forgotten history of the Allegheny Observatory,” published on Oct. 2, it was reported that Pluto is considered an exoplanet, which is false. An exo-
planet is a planet located outside the solar system that orbits around the Sun. Pluto is located within the solar system. It was also reported that the Allegheny Observatory
was instrumental in discovering exoplanets, which was also false. The Allegheny Observatory was instrumental in discovering two speciﬁc exoplanets. Finally, the article
stated David Turnshek is a professor of astrophysics and cosmology at Pitt. Turnshek is a professor of physics and astronomy with a focus in astrophysics and cosmology.

Religious groups rally in Oakland to support immigration reform.

Michael Lichtenberg
For The Pitt News

About two dozen people, some with the
phrase, “Stand Up! Fight Back!” embla-
zoned on their shirts, gathered outside
an Oakland church to protest the halt of
immigration reform and what they deem
to be-the mistreatment of Hispanic‘im-
migrants in the United States.

The demonstrators met at noon Friday
outside the Community of Reconciliation
Church, located on North Belleﬁeld Street,
to take part in nationwide protests that
were held Friday and Saturday.

The protesters represented a range of
ages, religions and racial backgrounds.
They convened in honor of what was re-
ferred to as the “National Day for Dignity
and Respect.” In observance of this event,
which took place Friday, members of labor
organizations, immigrant communities

and faith-based organizations across the
country demonstrated and called attention
to the challenges that immigrants must
overcome in order to become and remain
American citizens. '
The Pennsylvania Interfaith Impact
Network, comprised of organizations ac-
tive in southwestern Pennsylvania, orga-
nized the event. . ‘
Sarah Regenspan, an organizer for the
network, said that the legal status of im-
migrants can break families apart. V 3
:“It’s very scary for people to live here ’
and not know if a family member could
be picked up by [U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement] tomorrow and
be put into deportation proceedings, or
even transferred from one jail to another
without them knowing,” she said.
The protest came less than 48 hours
after Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Fla., introduced
a bill aimed to make the ﬁrst steps toward

comprehensive _immigration reform.
Members of the audience cheered “Pass
the bill!” each time a speaker mentioned it.
“It’s averyipainful process when a" fam-
ily gets torn apart,” said Regenspan. “And.
we’re just here to saythat we’re not going
to back down until this bill gets passed.”
Several prominent members of Pitts-

'burgh’s religious communities, including

Sister Betty Sundry of the Sisters of‘ Divine
Providence, Rabbi Ron Symons of Temple
Sinai and Rev. Linda Theophilus of the
Emmanuel Lutheran Church, gave pro-
vocative speeches inwhich they criticized
the government over what they saw as its
inaction on immigration reform. _
Some speakers quoted famous people,
religious and secular, such as Pope Francis
and Abraham Lincoln. Others introduced
guest speakers who have had family mem-
bers taken away and threatened with de-
portation, and all said they supported a

I
change in the immigration policies of the
United States.
Theophilus said in a speech that judges
in the United States make no allowances

for permanent and legal residents when

trying Hispanic immigrants. She said that
even in the case of veterans or those who
moved to America as young children,a
minor charge can lead to arrest or depor-
tation. . '

Symons had a more positive outlook
on the situation. '

“Jews understand that going way back
when, all the way to the Old Testament,
that caring for the stranger is one of the
most important things that we have to
do,” he said. A

According to Symons, the Torah tells
its readers to “love the stranger” more
than 36 times. He reminded them, “for

Pitt News writers and editors honored with national awards

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

An international student press associa--
tion has awarded seven pieces that ran
in The Pitt News last school year in a
contest it holds yearly.

The Columbia Scholastic Press As-
sociation has announced its 30th an-
nual Gold Circle Awards, which included
entries published fromjune 16, 2012, to
June 15, 2013. Through the Gold Circle
Awards, the association recognizes supe-
rior work by student journalists as indi-

viduals or in collaboration with others.
Out of more than 12,800 entries, judges
chose 1,780 pieces for first, second or
third place awards and for certiﬁcates
of merit.

Judges favored both installments of
the investigative series on the secret
campus organization known as the Dru-
ids.

Natalie Daher and Elizabeth Furiga,
both staff writers at the time, won sec-
ond place in the category of in-dep.th
news/feature story. Their collaborative

project, titled, “History, leadership,
transformation characterize Druids,”
ran April 10, 2013. Daher is currently
an Assistant News Editor for the paper.

Tom Visco, who was a staff writer last
year, also won a certificate of merit in
the same category for his investigative
piece, titled, “Druids dominate student
government,” which ran April 11, 2013.

The newspaper’s design staff was rec-

ognized for its accomplishments, too.
Amy Friedenberger, who was editor-
in- chief last year, and Cathy Butchy, who

was last year’s managing editor, jointly
won a certiﬁcate of merit in the category
of page one design tabloid format for the
March 28, 2013, issue.

Senior staff writer Jasper Wilson,
who was assistant Sports Editor at the
time, won second place in the category
of sports news for his recap of Pitt foot-
ball’s triple overtime loss to Notre Dame
last season. ‘

including “Apologize” and “Stop and

The audience constantly participat-
ed by ﬁlling in the lyrics to songs when
Tedder offered them the microphone.

Students swayed their hands in the air ' .

to the rhythm of the music.
“Ya’ll so perfect it hurts, Pitts-
burgh,” Tedder said. '
In the past, Fall Fest was similar to

a fair or carnival, allowing students a

to visit various food and game booths
on the William Pitt Union lawn. The
event did not always showcase musi-
cal artists, but Pitt Program Council
switched gears over the past couple

years by beginning to host popular .

TruthLIVE,.the sponsor of One
Republic’s concert, visited Pitt as
one of the five college campuses on
their smoking prevention tour this
year. TruthLIVE is an anti-smoking
campaign, and its college tour riders
provided activities for students in-
cluding a truth truck with games and
giveaways. ‘

Ras U-Ahk, who is part bf the tour ,

group, said the purpose of the tour is
to interact with the youth and pro-
vide them with the facts of tobacco
use without using a message that could
come off as preaching.

‘These facts were subtly distributed
to students on small labels on the give-

during the concert. '
U—Ahk said that students could do
whatever they pleased with those facts.
“We hope it saves a life,” he said.

While last year’s Fall Fest included
both booths and a musical perfor-
mance, this year’s festivities did not
include the booths. S

in room 630 of the William Pitt Union.
At this event, attendees can feel at ease
coming out for the first time or sharing
their own stories of coming out.

“That’s usually Very powerful,”
O’Brien said. “People are either in tears
or laughing”. p

Senior psychology major Emily Ma-
cLean, vice president of Pitt’s Campus
Women’s Organization, attended the
Speak Out night last year. _

‘.‘I think having the freedom to tell

your story and be yourself and having a

week where there are no boundaries to
what you want to say about your com-
munity is agood thing,” MacL'ean said.
The Rainbow Alliance will team up
with Campus Women’s Organization for
Tuesday’s Take Back» the Night event
at 7 p.m. in the Ballroom of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. The event highlights
sexual Violence against certain groups,
including women and LGBT people, that
might face a greater amount of violence
especially after dark. After learning a
number ofchants andgaining more
information about sexual violence on
college campuses, participants will take
to the streets of Central and South Oak-
land to raise awareness about the issue. )

“Everyone deserves to be able to

walk alone at night,” said Eleanora '

Kaloyeropoulou, a sophomore major-
ing in women’s studies who also serves
as CWO’s business manager.

For Kaloyeropoulou, it is important
to show support for many different dis-
enfranchised groups.

The Rainbow Alliance is coming on

‘board with the project to show sup-

port for Campus Women’s Organiza-
tion. Kaloyeropoulou said that minori-
ties and oppressed groups must band

' together to look after one another’s

interests. A _
“You can’t oppress one population
of people without directly affecting

someone else,” she said. V

On Oct. 7, the Rainbow Alliance will
hold an asexuality workshop at 8:45
p.m. in Dining Room A of the Union.
Asexuality is an orientation that in-
cludes people who have no desire for
sexual activity, or may otherwise
identify as having no sexual orienta-
tion. O’Brien said it is important to ac-
knowledge‘ asexuality as an orientation
because so many people forget that it
exists.

The Rainbow Alliance will also host

from One Republic, one of the more
popular acts Pitt has hosted.

Steffey said the council distrib-
uted advertisements for this year’s
event through social "media, email
lists, newsletters and stickers posted
around campus.

“There’s not an excuse not to know

about it,” she said.

At the end of August, after three
months of preparation, Pitt Program
Council officially announced that One
Republic would perform.

Steffey, along with eight students
who belong to Pitt Program Council,
began researching potential perform—
ers and reaching out to musical groups
last spring. Suggestions from other
PPC committee members, as well as
costs and timing, also influenced the
decision.

Students said that they were
pleased with the decision to host One
Republic.

Junior Reid‘Carter said that the
concert was even better than he had
expected. In comparison to other con-
certs Pitt has held in the past, Carter
said that this was one of the most
enjoyable ones. He also said that the
weather contributed to the experi—
ence.

“We lucked out. It was a beautiful
day,” he said. I

This observation led to enthusiastic ap-
plause from the crowd. His talk ended with
a brief prayer, for which those gathered
bowed their heads.

Regenspan said after the speakers ﬁn-
ished that she hoped the shutdown of the
federal government would not interfere
with the passage of immigration reform.

“We have so many people in the faith
community that have been working so hard
for so many years to get comprehensive
immigration reform to come in the form
of a real bill, and so we just can’t let all of
that hard work be sidelined now with all
of the shenanigans going on in Congress,”
Regenspan said.

Sisterjanice Vanderneck, the director
of Casa Sanjose, a religious aid center that
she opened over the summer that assists
Latino immigrants in Pittsburgh, motioned

protest group.

“You see several families there,” Vander-

' neck said. “Those are the families that suf-

“I know that [Coming Out Week] deﬁ-
nitely makes you feel publicly included,
whether or not you chose to come out
during that week,” Kaloyeropoulou said.
“It’s nice to feel supported so publicly.”

National Coming Out Week will cul-

on and off campus. Pittsburgh’s Mar-

Rainbow Alliance will also celebrate

“Personally I’d say that while we don’t
want to force anyone into coming out,
as the Rainbow Alliance, we always en-
courage it,” O’Brien said. “What better a

Discouraging EDM festival attendance
could prevent Ecstasy deaths

Brett Dresner
For the Pitt News

Her eyes rolled back in her head as
her friends did their best to sup-
port her dead weight. If it weren’t
forthe location, a club on the beach

in Barcelona, I might have mistaken _

her seizingforanexorcism, the pain

on her face easily recognizable as

the strobe lights ﬂashed violently.
I’ve seen people horribly intoxi-

I catedbefore,—butthiswasdifferent.

Every shake of her body made my
heart beat faster. She convulsed a
minute longer; then went limp, her
body seemingly exhausted from
this unexpected action. It was just
after midnight on an early Satur-
day morning in Spain, and I had
just watched someone overdose
on Ecstasy.

Unfortunately, writingacolurrm
discouraging people from exces-
sive drug or alcohol use wouldn’t
do much to change the culture that
electronic dance music has created.
So, instead, I am writing a column
to discourage people from attending
these events, from fueling a move-
ment that has already caused suffer-
ing and will inevitably cause more if
we don’t take a stand now.

My ﬁrst experience with house
music or EDM came three years
ago when my buddy played Avicii’s
“Seek Bromance” music video for
me on YouTube. Today, that video
has more than 27 million views, con-
sistentwith the explosion in EDM’s
popularity.

This “movement,” however,

unlike other social movements in .

American history, was not born
out of imperfections in society, but

instead,‘out of excessive drug and
alcohol use. As more horror stories
emerge every week surrounding the
EDM movement my only question
has become, when will it end?

According to thedea.org, there
were 76 deaths from Ecstasy over-
dose in2001, up from asingle death
in 1994. Although statistics from
more recent years were unavailable,
it can be assumed that these num-
bers have increased.

Ecstasy, which is the pill form
of MDMA, affects the body by in-
creasingheart rate and blood pres-
sure, as well as interfering with the
body’s ability to regulate its tem-
perature. It puts aperson at risk for
dehydration, which, combined with
the inability to keep the body cool,
can result in fatal overheating and
organ failure. Using large amounts
of Ecstasy atalime can resultin sei-
zures and abnormal heart rhythm.
Long term effects of Ecstasy use
can include issues ‘with memory
and learning.

This year, over Labor Day week-
end, the fourth armual Electric Zoo

Music Festival took place in New '

York City. The EDM event, which be-
gan in 2009, saw attendance num-
bers around 100,000 people, and
ticket prices soared to $300 forthe
three—day festival. Unfortunately,
tragedy struck on the second day as
two deaths from MDMA overdoses
caused the cancellation of the third
day. The victims were a 23-year-old
man and a 19-year-old woman.
While I can’t say I never bought
into the movement, as I have been to
DayGlow and anAvicii concertwhile
at Pitt, the deaths over the summer
and my experience iniBarcelona

have soured me to the music, the
culture and the environment as a

‘whole. - ,

In the ‘8os there was pop music
and cocaine. In the ‘90s there was
rap music and marijuana. Today it’s
electronic music and MDMA, better
known by its street name “Molly.”
Each music culture has come and
gone, but the arrival of festivals such
as Electric Zoo, Electric Daisy Car-
nival and Tomorrowworld suggests

‘that the EDM culture only seems to

have gained strength in the United
States, especially among college
students. .

But what is the culture?

If the two deaths from drug over-
doses don’t answer this question
clearly enough, then a quick search
of “Girl Tree Dancing” on You'I‘ube
will make it quite obvious -— the
video shows a college-aged girl get-
ting intimate with avery precocious,
good—looking and charming tree.

Some might argue that the EDM
culture is all about the music. The
music allows people to dress in ri-
diculous attire, which is only ever
acceptable at these events. The mu-
sic creates an environment most
would describe as carefree and lov-
ing. But at the heart of it all is the ex-
cess — the excess of drugs and the
excess of alcohol. Anyone who has
ever been to an EDM event can attest
to the fact that the abuse of drugs
and alcohol is omnipresent and
extremely frightening, and every
minute it seems as though someone
is being attended to by emergency
personnel.

Is that really a culture that people

Dresner Fe“ 7.

should embrace?

As college students we are at the forefront
of this movement, and I believe it is about time
we take control of it. It’s not to save ourselves
orto save our friends, but it is to save the next
generation. It’s to save our younger siblings
and our younger cousins. With every day the
EDM movement continues to grow as more

people take the risks and more people suffer
the consequences. You might not have known
the two victims who lost their lives at Electric

_ Zoo, but someone did. They each had a family.

Parents, siblings and friends all lost some-
one in_ their lives. But the movement hasn’t
stopped, and the culture certainly hasn’t
changed. In a week, DayGlow will return to
Pittsburgh.‘Thousands will attend, most using

.drugs or alcohol to intensify their experi-

ence. But every person who buys a ticket gives
money to this movement. They spray gasoline

on an open ﬂame. Unfortunately,.there is only
so much gasoline that can be sprayed before
something explodes.

Two college-aged kids have already suf-
fered from this ﬁre. One of them could have
been the girl sitting behind you in your biol-
ogy lecture. The other could have been the kid
in front of you at Pizza Hut, just getting lunch
in the middle of his busy day. If we don’t take
the necessary steps to quell this movement
and eliminate this culture, who knows who
could be next? Who knows whose friend it

might be? Who knows whose family will be
destroyed? ‘

While some movements can be changed
for the better, sometimes the best plan is elim-
ination. The EDM movement is not worth be-
ing changed. It’s not even worth being saved.
Let us, together, be responsible forpreserving
countless lives.'Let us, together, create a better
future for our friends, our families and those
who don’t deserve to have their lives cut short.

Both teams
lose in
blowouts over
weekend

Andrew Stern
Staff Wrz'ter

After hanging tough with a few of the
top teams in the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence, the Pitt women’s soccer team (4-8-
1, 0-7 ACC) experienced a major let down
in a 4-0 loss against the Syracuse Orange
(5-7-1, 1-5-1 ACC) Sunday afternoon at
Ambrose Urbanic Field.

“We absolutely had a let down today,”
captain Morgan Sharick said. “We had a
full week to get back at it and had some
promising things in training, but today
we gave up an early easy goal and put our
heads down. That kind of performance
is unacceptable.”

The afternoon started out promising
for the Panthers, as the team dominated
the ﬁrst 15 minutes of the match. Follow-
ing the opening stretch, the Panthers had
a defensive lapse that allowed the Orange
to strike off a corner kick from the foot
of Jackie Firenze.

On the play, Firenze sent a perfect ball
that midﬁelder Megan Hunsberger found
near the side of the goal and headed into
the back of the net.

“I felt that wehad a good week of prac-
tice and were prepared. We knew some of
the things they wanted to do, yet we still
allowed them to do it. The lack of atten-
tion to detail was really disappointing,”
head coach Greg Miller said.

Following the goal, the Panthers con-
tinued to struggle with the pressure that
Syracuse was applying.

The team did, however, have a golden

Blue team pulls out last-second victory in scrimmage

Point guard James Robinson-has his layup blocked by forward Mike Young. Ben Brownlee | Senior Staff Photographer -

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The ﬁfth annual Maggie Dixon Heart Health
Fair and basketball scrimmage, which was
free and open to the public, culminated in
a last—second, 68-67 win for the blue side
by virtue of redshirt junior Cam Wright’s
3-point shot that narrowly beat the buzzer.
The gold team was coached by assistant
Brandin Knight and the blue team led by
head coachjamie Dixon.

Despite this scrimmage being played be-
tween members of the Pitt basketball team,
the competitiveness among the players was
palpable. Late in the second half, the gold
team got rowdy with the referees when a

supposed bad call was made that would
have put the Blue team at an advantage.

“I was deﬁnitely competitive and want-
ed to win,” freshman Mike Young said. “I
wanted to play well and show what I can
do to those who haven’t seen me play yet.”

The Pittsburgh native was a highly tout-
ed recruit, and he made his presence on
the court known by his quick ball handling
skills and ﬂuid passing.

Along with Young, other freshmen, such
as Jamel Artis andjosh Newkirk, hoped to
use the scrimmage to make a statement to
head coach Jamie Dixon. However, their
young age and inexperience playing at a
collegiate level come as a hindrance.

“They have a lot of deﬁciencies, and they

know it,”Dixon said. “But they’re good play-
ers, and they are going to play.”

With it being this early in the season,
mistakes are to be expected from a team
that will rely on multiple freshmen.

Sophomores Durand Johnson and Jo-
seph Uchebo sat out the scrimmage because
of injuries.Johnson is suffering from a con-
cussion and Uchebo is recovering from a
knee injury. J

Despite the fact that the Panthers have
only participated in ﬁve practices as a team,
Artis is optimistic about his team’s season.

“We’re coming along very well. There’s a
lot of chemistry,” Artis said. “I think we’re

VOLLEYBALL-

Pittssplits weeke

Caitlin Hinsley
Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

The Pitt women’s volleyball team wrapped
up its home stand this weekend by splitting
the two matches. Pitt beat Virginia Tech in
straight sets Friday evening at the Fitzgerald
Field House, and then the Panthers lost a

V heartbreaking, ﬁve—set match Saturday eve-

ning against Virginia, 3-2.

“We didn’t start oﬁ’ as strong as we usu-
ally do,” junior opposite Mechael Guess said
of Saturday’s loss . “We couldn’t get a pass
andput it down like we usually do, but we
are going to keep working and be able to get
back on trac .”

On Friday night, however, the Panthers
(11—6, 3-1 ACC) came out swinging against
Virginia Tech (13~4, 1-2 ACC), starting each set
with a lead and defeating the Hokies, 25-19,
25-20 and 25-18.

Virginia Tech took an early lead in the ﬁrst
set, but an 8-1 run by Pitt that included three
aces by freshman outside hitter Maria Gen-
itsaridi helped Pitt gain a 14-10 advantage.
The Hokies fought back and came within two

points of Pitt, but they never took control of ~

the game.

The second setfollowed in similar fashion,
with Pitt leading early and Virginia Tech tak-
ing a brief lead. Seven kills by junior outside

hitterjessica Wyrm in set two helped Pitt take
a25—2o victory.’ . . .
“I feel like I just got really comfortable on
the court after the ﬁrst set,” Wynn said. “I
deﬁnitely got the ball a lot more in the second

set, so I justfeel like itwas an opportunity for V
_ me to heat up.”

Pitt made things exciting in the third set by
trading points with Virginia Tech. After back-
and—forth play led to a 16-16 tie, Pitt went on a
huge run. The Panthers scored nine of the next

11 points and grabbed the set and matchwin. -
Wynn ﬁnished the night with a match- .

high 16 kills and tallied -nine digs._]unior set-
ter Lindsey Zitzke recorded 25 assists while

both Guess and junior opposite Kate Yeazel
had 10 kills. , ‘

Saturday night proved to be a different i

story, though, as Virginia (97, 2-2 ACC)
notched a ﬁve-set thrilling victory that Pitt
had within its grasp.

“I think we could have ﬁnished faster, but
we are going to grow from this experience,”
junior defensive specialist Delaney Clesen said
about the team’s ﬁrst loss in the ACC.

Pitt made costly errors in the ﬁrst set.

Five of the ﬁrst seven points for the Cava-
liers came from Pitt errors, and it seemed as
though the Panthers were outplayed. But after
using both of their timeouts early, Pitt began
to ﬁnd its rhythm.

With the Panthers behind 11-4 after their
second timeout, Pitt proceeded tooutscore
Virginia, 18-14, thanks in partto sixkills from
Guess. However, the Panthers’ comeback fell

short, and they dropped the ﬁrst set, 22-25.

chance to tie the game and gain some mo-
mentum, when Syracuse goalie Brittany
Anghel was caught out of position leaving
the Orange goal open. But Roosa Arvas’
shot went off the cross bar and bounced
away, squashing the Panthers’ best threat

_ to score all afternoon. '

Just 15 minutes later, the Orange ex-
tended their lead when Stephanie Skilton
received a beautiful give-and-go pass from
fellow striker Erin Simon. The goal was one
of three that Skilton scored on the day.

Following the halftime break, the Pan-
thers tried to get back in the match, but
just couldn’t crack the tough Syracuse
defense. ‘

The game was fairly even until Syracuse

put theimatch away for good when Stepha-
nie Skilton took a perfect through from

Rachel Blum to score the thirdorange goal ‘

of the match and her second goal.

Just a mere seven minutes later, Skilton
slammed the door shut when the fresh-
man from New Zealand scored her third
goal of the match. Following the goal,
Miller pulled goalie Nicole D’Agostino, and
brought in Taylor Francis for the remain-
ing seven-plus minutes. '

“Today we were not all on the same '

page, and we were not ready to play,”
D’Agostino said.

The loss dropped the Panthers to 0-7
in ACC play, and was the second- to- last
home game of the season. Pitt is off be-
fore the team takes to the pitch Thursday
against Miami and next Sunday against

_No. 6 Florida State, respectively.

“Today we were never really able to

.overcome some of the early mistakes and

regroup ourselves: That part of it is really
disappointing. Now it’s gut-check time and
time to focus on our next game [against
Miami] ,” Miller-said.

Men’s Soccer

The Virginia Cavaliers dominated the
Pitt men’s soccer team in a 5-0 shutout
Friday night, as the Panthers were outshot
17-2 and saw goalkeeper Dan Lynd last for
just more than a half of play.

Pitt (O-6-2, 0-5 ACC) is now the pro-
prietor of a 20-match winless stretch,
courtesy of the performance delivered
by Virginia (6-3-1, 2-2-1 ACC) at Klockner
Field, the Cavaliers’s home stadium.

Riggs Lennon scored in the 10th minute
for the only goal Virginia needed during
the match. The goal was one of two that the

freshman would score during the evening.

The night got much worse for the Pan-
thers when Virginia struck again in the
20th minute. Pitt was unable to clear the
ball out of its defensive zone, and Eric Bird

1 made the Panthers pay, when he shot and

scored past a diving Lynd.
Right before the break, the Cavaliers
tallied their third goal of the match when

they caught the Panthers by surprise with .

just four minutes to play in the ﬁrst half.
Following halftime, Virginia continued
to.pressure the Panthers, as the Cavaliers
struck for the fourth goal of the match.
Darius Madison dribbled the down to goal

line, where he’ alertly crossed the ball to a

cutting Lennon for the freshman’s second
goal and a 4-0 lead.

the Cavaliers. With the score 10-13 in favor of
Virginia, Pitt hit its stride.

The Panthers clawed back to take a 16-14
lead, which caused Virginia to call a timeout.
The timeout couldn’t slow the Panthers mo-
mentum, as Pitt scored the next three points
and ultimately captured set two, 25-20.

Pitt carried its strong offensive play into
the third set, sporting a .500 hitting percent-
age and never trailing in the set. The biggest
lead came with Pitt up 18-9 and 20-11 before it
ﬁnished off the Cavaliers with a 25-17 set win.

' As strong as the Panthers played in the
second and third sets, though, their play be-
gan to slip. Set four was a game of runs for

I both teams. Pitt was down-9-6 before going
on an 8-0 run that was ﬁnished with a kill by
senior outside hitter Monica Wignot. But then
Virginiawent onarun of its own, scoring 10 of
the next 11 points — including seven straight
in one stretch of the rally — to take a 19-15 lead
before sealing its second set win of the night '
with a 21-25 victory.
