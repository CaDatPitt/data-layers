. Officials Probe Pitt’s Future with State

  

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN
a (See Editorial, “A Perennial
Problem,” Page 4.)

HARRISBURG—The Pitt
News did a series of articles
last term dealing with the
State Legislature’s failure
to appropriate the Univers-
ity’s funds. An agreement
was ﬁnally reached, but not be-
fore the University was forced
to borrow several million dol-
lars to meet operating expenses.
This past yea.r’s legislative stale-
mate combined with the stale-
mate that befell our school the

 

preceding year when we became
state-related; led us to, pose the
following question to various
-state-wide officials: “What next?
Are appro-priations hassles a
built-in reoccurrence?”

Governor Raymond P. Shafer
had the following statement: “I
hope to have the budget sub-
mitted and approved early this
year, so Pitt won’t have to wait.”
He also commented that he
hoped to submit the budget ﬁve
years in advance by 1970, and
that after this next budget, the
budget will be forecast in this
manner. The Governor could not

to wait until the Budget Sec-
retary submits the mandated

items he must fulﬁll——programs ‘

which are law.”

As for a solution, the Gover-
nor felt that a key was a long-
range picture which would ar-
range the budget so that mon.
ics would ﬂow into the desig.
nutc-(I universities and hospitals
on S('ll('(IlII(_’.

Senator Ernest P. Kline, Dem-
ocratic minority leader, felt the
ﬁt-rst stop to be taken to resolve
the dilemma which faced our
University was to “take the ap-
propriations out of the non-pre-

 

ferred category and put them
into the preferred class.” He
stated that he felt this change
in status could realistically be
accomplished.

* Senate President ‘Pro Tem-
pore Robert Fleming (R.) con-
curred With Senator Kline. “I
would like to see the sta13e—Ire-
lated institutions receive prefer-
red -status, if possible. Frankly,
I don’t know if it can be done
by legislative amendment or by
constitutionatl am e n d m ent. It
will be explored; whether it can
be accomplished is the {big ques-
tion.”

Supporting Visa Status

Of Professor Tsang

by PAUL STOLLER

Student Government (SG) has
taken a keen interest concern-
ing an academic controversy at
the University. SG passed a res-
olution concerning the visa stat-
us of Dr. Tsa-n.g, dean of the
University of Hong Kong.

Dr. Tsang who was scheduled
to teach two courses in contem-
porary Chinese history here has
not yet received permission from
the State Department to enter
the country.

The resolution proposed by Sen-
ator Jonathan Mewers, chiarged
SG with the responsibility of
sending a telegram to Presi-
dent Johnson. The telegram
which was sent out Wednesday
night stated the following: “We
are concernedpthat since Aug. 1
there has been no action upon
the visa status of Dr. Tsang,

Chapel services this week-end
for all faiths will be dedicated
to the memory of George Wash-
ington Carver, in line with the
national holiday passed by proc-

meroate his death 25 years ago.

Mrs. Frances Holland, chair-
man of this year‘s George Wash-
ington Carver Luncheon and ini-
tiator of the services to be dedi-
cated to him, described the sig-
niﬁcance of Carver as “his sim-
plicity of manner and his unsel-
ﬁshness in he-lping students to
become educated. He was a poor
man, for every bit of money he
realized from his scientiﬁc dis-
coveries went to furthering the
education of students who had
no other ﬁnancial resources.

An Interview with Dr. Kurtzman

Solutions for Pitt’s Problems

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN

HARRISBURG——Dr. Dav-
id H. Kurtzman left the
University last September
to become Superintendent of‘
Public Instruction for the
State of Pennsylvania and
to serve in Gov. Raymond P.
Shafer’s Cabinet. He thus retains
his lifetime title as Chancellor
Emeritus, however, and his af-
fection for the members of the
University community. His ever-
present interest and concern for
the University were reﬂected in
a Pitt News interview conducted
here last week.

In his new position, Dr. Kurtz-
man is vitally concerned with
the University, as he is with all
institutions of learning in Penn-
sylvania. He deﬁned his new
position as “the coordination of
the total educational program
for the State, including both bas-
ic and higher education, and
the giving of advice and guid-
ance to local school districts.

Because of his keen aware-

forts to obtain our funds from
the State, Dr. Kurtzman ﬁelded

questions for The Pitt News in
this particular area.

“There are two approaches to
this dilemma,” he stated. “One
is to be able to have a budget
for the universities a year be-
fore they need the money. This
would enable them to know
how to plan their activities
ahead of time.”-

    

they can plan. The formula
would determine the support
for the universities. It would
specify that the universities get
so much per student. A recog-
nized formula ought to take into
account the different kinds of
programs Otf the various institu-
-tions. The advantage of this
method is that when the Legis-
lature finally gets around to ap-
proving the appropriations, the
schools would know what to ex-
pect.”

Dr. Kurtzman also discussed
the possibility of taking the
state-related institutions out of
the anon-preferred category. “This
wouldn't help‘ much. The Gov-
ernor will wouldn't have had
money for the institutions even
ifthey were in the preferred
category this time.”

Library at al Cpacity

Some visitors, noticing ‘V

that the first floor is closed
and that boxes andcrates
of books still arciunshelved,
wonder whether the library is
really ready for use. Mrs. San-
dra Lord, the Library's public
reations head, promises that,
though the building may not be
“impressive until the spring,”
it is now ready to give better
service than was available in
the Cathedral quarters.

Seeing rows of empty book-
shelves, unfinished elevators,
and the squad of busy workmen
might still leave some uncon-
vinccd. The carpeted and granite
floors, the marble baseboards,

, and the extensive teak paneling

go unappreciated without the
coor coordinated furniture or-
dered for the building and with
the aged wooden desks and
chairs of the old library. Even
the nearly 600,000 volumes on
the third and fourth floors fill,
it seems, only half the space,

Mr. Lord explained that the
working tjapacity of the new
library is 1.2 million books and,
thus, is only half filled by the
library's current. collection. She
said that library officials “think
it will meet the needs a. decade
form now.”

Budget allowances have al-
Y‘-‘ady been made, noted Mrs.
Lord, to begin ‘a rapid expansion
of the number of volumes. With-
in “a few years,” the size of the
undergraduate library, which
will occupy the first and sec.
ond floors, will increase from
the present 5,000 books to 150,.
000 works.

Included in the undergraduate
will be the Alldred Browsing
Collection of popular fiction,
two smoking rooms, typing
rooms, a periodical collection,
the reserve book collection, and
nine conversation rooms. These
cnversation rooms are now
available on a first come first
served basis for any discussions
that would disturb others trying

Won’t Stop New SU

The last of the Student Union
improvements should be com-
pleted by the end of February,
-according to John Loch, direc-
-tor of the Student Union. He
strongly emphasized, however,
that the renovation w i ll_ not
halt the plans for a new Union.
Loch pointed out that the im-

provements developed from a _ pg
‘recognition to meet more of the

students’ needs. For instance,
many of the functions of the
lower Lounge, such as study
lounge and TV lounge will -now
be broken down into separate
sections of the Union.

The study area will be where
the main desk is, and the -TV
area will. have the old store’s
location. The L0 w er Lounge
will serve recreational purposes,
becoming what Loch terms a
“where-the-action-is-lounge.” The

new union information center
will be in the center of the
Marble Lounge, which will be a
meeting area with seating
around the Information desk.
The center will perform the
same duties as the main desk
now does, but will also have
equipment for pool and small
games available.

The last of the changes will
be the TV and study area. There-
fore, Loch asks the cooperation
of the students to establish a
temporary area in the Venetian
Room for these activities. What
use_is in store permanently for
the Venetian Room will be de-
cided through the Union Ad-
visory Committee.

Another innovation is in the
hours for the. Hunt Room. The
new hours are from 7:30 a.m.
to 10 p.m. Monday through Fri-

Dr. Rubenstein Talks"  

On the ‘New Morality’

“The reason Anltonioni’-s Blow Up grips you is because it's to-

ing. at the University Catholic Club.

Dr. Ruben-srtein’s comments -on the “new morali

merits of the society ranging from “the social reality of the mobile,
anonymous millions of unmarrieds,” to labeling youth as having

the “Hippie option.”

Dr. Rubenstein emphasized his point of the “new morality” by
comparing today to “his time, the age of Bonnie and Clyd. He said,
“We could have never taken affluence for granted.” He stressed

that this is one cause of the lack

“My nine year old child doesn’t have to read the newspaper to
know ‘what’s going on in the world, continued Rubenstein. The
printing on the page doesn’t have the same sensual appeal as the

cinemascope screen.”

Turning to the college stu-

When the topic of the dying
of religious ties was brought up,
Dr. Rubenstein brieﬂy mention-
ed the “Death of God Philoso-
phy.” “The death of God Philo-
-sophy is the cultural absence of
God from decision making pro-

advocate that God was dead but,
“I am like a physician diagnos-

Dr. Rubenstein concluded his
discussion by reciting the nurs-

interpreted, “Something has

of the myth that we are the ﬁrst

relation of the previous genera-

from them, thus a partial cure
to the “new morality.”

‘Pitt News’ Review

‘Graduate’

by ANNE DORN

Benjamin Braddock is not
the average college gradu-
ate, but at times it may be
easy for the average college
student to identify with
him. His story, The Gradu-
ate, is the superbly acted
story of a young man who
comes h-om-e from school to ﬁnd
his former life unacceptabcle. He
can’t stop asking himself why
he ‘went to college and what he
wants to do with his education.
His parents, unfortunately, are
not patient enough t-o wtait while
he answers these questions. They
want him to get a job and settle
down.

But first, the Bnaddocks are
determined to remake him in
their image. At a graduation
party they throw for him, they
show him off as another one of
their status symbols, bragging
about his scholastic and ath-
letic achievements. During the
party, Benjamin slips away to
be alone, but is followed by Mrs.
Robinson (Anne Ban-croft), a
neighbor and a friend of his
parents. She asks Benjamin
(Dustin Hoffman) to take her
home because her husband is
drunk. Her request is not as in-«u
nocent as it sounds, and once

. in her house, she asks Ben to

h.e1p her “slip into something
more comfortable.” He turns
down her offer, but decides dif-
ferently in a day or so. The in-
evitable affair develops.
Everything runs smoothly un-
til Mrs. Robinson's daughter,
Elaine J(_I£atheriu.e Ross), an un-
dergraduate at Berkeley, comes
for a visit. Ben’s parents insist
that he take her out, and he
does so only to oblige his par-
ents. In the middle of their date,
however, he realizes that this
girl is for him. His feelings for
her are only intensiﬁed by Mrs.
Robinscnn’s objections. Mrs. Rob-
inson chooses a ﬁance for Elaine
more to her liking and arranges
a marriage. At the ﬁnal moment
of the wedding, however, Ben
bursts into the church and steals

 

   

BENJAMIN steals Elaine away from wedding and guests.

the bride away.

The Graduate gives us the
ﬁne acting of experienced ac-
tress like Anne Bancroft and of
relative newcomers like Dustin
Hoffman and the transition be-
tween scenes enhances the per-
formances. It is a unique type
of transition: while the screen
continues to show a scene, the
dialogue for the next scene is
heard. Another means of transi-
tion is the inclu.sion of either
glass or water in every scene.
Director Mike Nichols means
this to show Ben as a “moth be-
hind glass,” butthe metaphor is
not as clearly put as it should
be. The score by Simon and Gar-
funkel is perfect for the moral
background of the movie and
also adds to the quality of the
transition as it plays the appro-
priate tunes between scenes.

The Graduate is partly a stan-
dard attack on materialism, but
is also a commentary showing
the u-selessness of much of col-
lege education to personal lives
and desires. College, as the mo-
vie presents it, can’t teach val-
ules or tell us who to marry—
it sometimes is -only a four-year
vacation from moral limbo, solv-
ing nothing.

The movie oomblnes the at-
tack on materialism and the
commentary on college success-

fully. Perhaps the scene that
best accomplishes this is the
one between Benand Mrs. Rob-
inson in which he asks her what
her major was in college. She
replies “art,” and we realize that
Mrs. Robinson was once like
Ben—searching' and questioning
— until she threw away her
idealism for her husband's mon-
ey.

For all this worldly moraliz-
ing, action in The Graduate is
iso-lat-ed. If The Graduate seems
to be moving in a vacuum, it is
because, asserts Nichols, “It’s
about a place in a vacuum.” The
one-sided attack on American
Society in The Graduate is justi-

ﬂed, it would seem, by Ameri’

can society itself, with Ben rep-
-resenting troubled youth and
Mns. Robinson representing cor-
rupt adulthood.

Nichols wants his movie to
criticize American affluence and
its effect. He refers to the “Los
Angelesation of the world; when
people are drowned in objects
they become objects." But The
Graduate leaves us little choice.

Russian Judaism

Dr. Allen Pollack, professor of
Russian history at the Univer-
sity, will talk on “Jews in the
Russian Revolutionary Move-
ment” on Monday at 8:15 p.m.
at the YM and VVHA, 315 S.
Belleﬁeld Ave.

The 50th anniversary of the
Russian Revolution was 1967. It
was an event of incomparable
signiﬁcance to the world. Jews
who lived in Russia, almost 6,-
000,000 of them, both inﬂuenced
the course of the Revolution
and were affected by it.

Dr. Pollack will analyze‘ the
Revolutionary Movements: Bol-
sheviks, Mensheviks, Social Rev-
olutionaries, Anlairchtists, Bund.
He will cleary draw the battle
lines between Socialism and
Zionism, and show how they
fought for the allegiance of the
Jewish Intelligentsia.

Thi.s lecture is open to the
public.

They are all beautiful songs, they
are some of her best songs but
when she sang‘ them, they sound-
ed cold and distant. The audience
could feel the lack of emotion and

began to grow uneasy and distant ‘

to Buffy in return.

Then Buffy spoke of some of .

the results that such a. feafful
inhumanity has brought to the In-
dians. The average life span of
an Indian is only 40 years and
their infant mortality is among
the highest in the world. Our
fears and our ignorance have
forced the natives of our land
to live in wretchedness and while
we mouth noble sentiments, Buf-
fy asks what will become of her
people .“Now that the Buffalo are
Gone.”

What, indeed! As Miss Sainte-
Marie said, “The American Gov.
ernment doesn't bother to answer
the needs of the Indians and even
Buffy herself had difficulty stat-
ing what must be done’ The In.
dians die from lack of food. They
diefrom lack of medicine, they
die from lack of medicine, they

heritage and forced into an ig.
noble exile on their own land.”

  Editorial: A Perennial Problem?

_ The University finally received its appropriation. The State Legis-
lature reached an agreement that resolved the months of haggling and

I name-calling. At first glance, it would appear that our prospects are

bright, now that we received our funds. However, we cannot forget
that this year’s struggle was not unique; we experienced a similar
delay in 1966 when we received our state-related status. What is to
prevent our funds from being continually delayed, as the legislators

‘ argue about the various issues that somehow always arise concerning

appropriations? _
The question of financial stability has not been resolved satis-
factorily. We cannot be satisfied with the temporary solution — our

receiving our funds, thus enabling us to meet operating expenses.
We’re saved~—but only temporarily. Unless an effective, long-range
solution is devised to forestal a future crisis,” We’re still in that same,
old predicament of being forced to endure the legislative hassles that
inevitably occur. _

We must re-emphasize that the University is at the half-way mark.
There is no sure road to greatnesss. We’ll go one step further. As
of now, there is no sure road to the financial security toward the at-
tainment of our goal of a quality institution. It would be a grave

 error to consider the matter of our University’s funding as resolved.
7’ We have merely overcome one more hurdle; the current structure of

 Plight of Spock and Coffin

the State Legislature gives every indication that the problem will occur
yearly. '

One probable solution cited by legislative leaders is to give the
University and the two other state-related institutions preferred status.
However, as Dr.Kurtzman pointed out, the changing of our status
does not preclude further financial problems, for the same amount
of money would still be needed for the state’s countless programs,
regardless of how they’re classified. If there aren’t sufficient funds,
the status cannot assure anything save a preference when some finan-
cial provisions are made.

A solution proposed by Chancellor Posvar would be to provide
the needed funds through a state authority. The Chancellor explained
that the authority would borrow funds only from the beginning of
the fiscal year until appropriations were made. It would make out-
right grants, not loans, to the Universities. He stated, “If appropri-
ations were made promptly in the new year, the authority would not
have to exercise its borrowing power, but any need for funds result-
ing from delays in appropriations would be satisfied, at no cost to
the University, through funds applied by the authority.”

We urge the Governor and members of the State Legislature to
seriously consider the Chancellor’s proposal as a most satisfactory
solution to an unsatisfactory state of affairs.

The Price of Dissent

The indictments of anti-war leader Dr.
Benjamin Spock and Yale University
Chaplain William Sloan Coffin, Jr. brings
to light a severe dilemma in the traditions

1:. ‘of American society—-the legal limitation

of dissent.

A Boston grand jury recently indicted
Spock, Coffin, and other prominent anti-
war protest leaders with “committing sev-
eral overt acts of conspiracy,” according
to Newsweek. The indictment specifically
cited a boston rally where a number of
draft cards were turned in. After collec-
tion, the draft cards were turned over to
the Justice Department. A conviction on
the charge of conspiracy could bring with
it a five year term and a $10,000 fine.

The grand jury action brought on satis-

K faction and praise from Selective Service

Chief General Lewis B. Hershey who advo-
cates harsh measures against draft resist-
ers. “Certainly,” said Hershey, “if anyone
is counseling people (to evade the draft)
that ought to be stopped.”

The importance of the government’s
crackdown on anti-war and anti-draft pro-
testors is not that it gives Hershey a sub-
ject to praise. Nor is it that a number of
prominent anti-war leaders could be con-
victed of conspiracy charges that could re-

sult in five year prison terms. The crucial

point here is that the indictments have set

‘ limits on dissent in the U.S.

It is common knowledge that all U.S.
citizens are guaranteed the right of free
speech under the auspices of the 1st
amendment of the constitution. However,
the right of free speech, as it is legally
interpreted does not permit a citizen to

 - expouse- either the evasion of the draft or

the overthrow of the government. There-
fore, Spock and Coffin have legally over-
stepped their bounds.

By tripping over the boundaries of -the
law, both Spock and Coffin have had their
rights of dissent limited and have there-

by Paul Stoller

can- an individual go in defiance of the
status-quo? Does the Federal government
have a right to indict those persons who
have legitimate moral objections but whose
beliefs run contrary to the existing legal
set-up? These are thorny question indeed.

Commenting on this very subject, James
Reston, associate editor the The New York
Times, noted that the government does not
openly object to legitimate dissent. How-
ever, when the actions of a dissenter smack
into the brick wall of the law, the individ-
ual concerned should be indicted.

Reston’s comments, however, merely
present the situation as it exist-—it reveals
the controversy between moral and legal
concerns, over the draft and the war. The
controversy, however, still remains. How
can an individual or, more realistically, a
group of individuals legitimately alter the
status-quo or the law.

The tragic answer to this problem is
that it is most difficult for any group to
alter the status-quo today. This fact runs
contrary to that traditional system of
American deliberation which has always
stressed public debate. The failure to alter
the static Selective Service System during
the spring of 1967 is a case in point It was
last year that some of our duly elected
representatives attempted to change the
archaic draft law. Even with a prodigious
amount of public pressure, the basic tenets
of the law remained.

So the draft remains and the war goes
on. This is the status-quo that men like
Spock and Coffin morally object to. Un-
fortunately, their moral and legal rights
of dissent have been limited by the very
status-quo to which they were opposed.
This, then, is the plight of the protestor,
and it has caused Spock and Coffin to
break the law.

Morally, this is their only course of
persuit. By taking such action, Coffin
and Spock have subjected themselves to
the penalties of the law. Now they must

Arena Replies to
Brourman Story

Dear Mr. Brourman:

We of the Civic Arena man-
agement read your article of
December 6,1967, éeserieing agi-
-leged improper handl-ing o-f tick-
ets at the Steel Bowl games on
December 9 and 10, 1966, and

we wish to reply for the .r‘\§-cord. .

As you know, we told you that
if you could make a positive
identiﬁcation of personnel em-
ployed who took part in the
activity your article describes,
we would take immediate disci-
plinary action.

In our meeting and discus-
sions of December-8 and 9, 1967,
you could not make a positive
identification that would enable
us to take disciplinary action.

In the future we requ-est «that

snsususulusu

whenever you or any member of
Pitt News staff sees or has
knowledge of any irregularity
in the handling of tickets, you
immediately advise a member of
the Arena management or su-
pervisory staff so that we can
act promptly. Employee num-
ber, exact time and place, ticket
or seat number and any other
perti-nenit ﬂacts should be noted
if possible.

The officers and members of
Local 188, BSEIU, who do all
crowd control work at the Civic
Arena, have asked us to ex-
press to you both their resent-
ment of -an accusa.-ti-on that could
have been effectively investi-
gated one year ago, and their
willingness to cooperate with us
in disciplinary action. found war-

   Letters To The Editor‘

Usher Denies
Expose Charge

Editor, The Pitt News:

Since the very advent of the
freedoms of thought and ex-
pression, man has become more
aware of the evils of his socie-
ty. Criticisms, satires and ex-
poses reveal to the masses of
people areas where there is a
need for some sort of improve-
ment. Some ofthe greatest men
of literature have devoted much
of their lives to just such a
cause. However, when these cri-
ticisms and accusations are with-
out evidence to substantiate
-them, then perhaps the topic of
concern is something for re-
consideration, not only by the
reader but by the author as
well.

I refer to one Mike Brourman
and his recent Pitt News arti-
cle of Dec. 6. In this scathing
expose of big time con men
(namely, a group of Civic Arena
ushers), Mr. Brourman has
broken the “Case of the Bed-

ford Ave. “Swindle” wide open.

His claims amount to the idea
that the “ushers” at the Arena
collect the tickets from the in-
coming patrons and pass these
stubs off to other ushers who
sell them to various “victims”
outside the Bedford Ave. en-
trance. Nice story but I’m afraid
it’s a little two ﬂamboyant for
my taste.

You see, I happen to be an
usher at the Arena and have
been since last February. I
spend several hours every week
with these men who you would
blatantly accuse of cheating the
charity which sponsors the Steel

Bowl. Keeping this in mind, I
would hope that a few words to
the wise would be sufficient: ‘

First, the Arena has a set
number of ushers and ticket-
takers per event. These men in
order to do their job have to
remain conﬁned to a speciﬁc
area, thereby making it impos-
sible to go outside for any rea-
son.

Secondly, "all tickets are torn
in half by a ticket-taker (not
usher, Mr. Brourman) and,
truthfully, would you buy half
a ticket for an event.

Thirdly, city police are sta-
tioned at each of the gates for

each of the events. I for one
believe that they do their job.

In addition, your quoted con-
versation indicates your pres-
ence at the scene of the crime.
Every 1.llSl'i€I‘ has a number readi-
ly visible on his coat. If what
you claim is true, why couldn't
you simply report the incident
immediately? Perhaps a few
spoken words in the right place
would have eliminated a great
many written ones in -the wrong
place.

Finally, it is surmised that
this “practice is not conﬁned to
charity afﬁairs alone” but “is
also commonplace at other Arena

affairs.” It seems to me that you
either spend a great deal of
time at the Arena or simply
don't know what you’-re talking
about. ' i

In short, Mr. Brourman, the
next time you get a chance to
write a Pitt News Exclusive, I
would suggest -that you write it
concerning tsomethinag you ex-
clusively know about. In the
meantime why don't you take
in a good blaSk€|lLbI3.Ll.l garne—on

Stop Secret Research

WASHINGTON (CPS)'——Twenty-one government agencies have
agreed to‘ stop secret funding of some academic research on foreign
countries.

But the ban does not include any natural sciences research. In
other words, it excludes all the “hardware” research done by uni-
versities for the military on weapons, etc. The ban does include “soft-
ware” research, which deals with social and DSyCh0108iC81 aSl3€ClS Of

a country. Research that does
not involve a foreign society or
area is not included in the ban.
The agencies who agreed to
the ban include several State De-

partment bureaus-, the‘ Central

Intelligence Agency, a number of
Defense Department Agencies,
the Executive Office of the Presi-
dent, and several government
foundations.

The agreement, however, does
not contain any provisions for
enforcement, although some of-
ficials said they believe the agen-
cies do not want to continue the
practice orthey would not have

agreed to such a public state-
ment.

There is apparently no rela-
tionship between the Code, which
was issued by the State Depart-

ment, and the work of a commit-

tee headed by Secretary of State-

Dean Rusk which is looking into
ways- of financing projects previ-
ously secretly supported by the
CIA.

The only procedures outlined
by officials releasing the state-
ment was that each agency's re-

HEP Needs Pitt Students 1
To Tutor Underprivileged

The Hill Education Project
(HEP) is now accepting stu-
dents interested in working dur-
ing the winter trimester. HEP
is ‘a volunteer tutorial service
which works with elementary,
junior, and senior high schools
in the Hill District of Pitts-
burgh.

The broad purpose of this pro-
gram is to help overco-me the
-educational and cultural disad-
vuan-tages of students in the area.
This objective is done in cooper-
ation with the adminnistration
and faculty of the «schools.

Tutoring is done in basic sub-

ject areas to improve reading,
writing, and arithmetic skills.
HEP is set up on a one tutor to
one pupil ratio, with the hope
that their relationship will be-
come more than an academic
one.

All students are eligible to
participate in the program. Tu-
toring involves only a minimum
of time, between classes or at
night.

Information boo-th-s with ap-
plications will be set up Jan.
15-19 in the Towers Lobby and
on the G-round Floor of CL.

burgh was oificially dedicated.
'I‘-his academic year marks the
tenth anniversary of the Pitt
Student -Union and to commemo-
-rate this event, the Student
Union Board has declared that

uled for each day.

Associated Women Students Plan
For Balanced 1968-69 Elections

Applications are n o w avail-
able for all women students
interested in applying for pos-
itions with the Associated Wom-
en Students (AWS). The appli-
cations may be picked up at
1209 CL, the SU desk, and the
desks in all the women’s dorm-
itories between Jan. 11 and
Jan. 25.

This year the philosophy be-
hind AWS has expanded to rep-
resent all women students.
“Greater commuter representa-
tion will be insured,_” stated
Ronna Edelstein, present AWS
elections chairman.

Miss Ed-elstein clarified this
by adding that two of the four
class representatives for each
class will be commuters. A max-
imum of ' eight. representative

candidates has been set for each
class, sophomore, junior, an d
senior. All freshmen are rep-
resented by Freshman Council,
which holds its election in the
fall, after the freshmen join the
University community.

For the first time, applications
will be available for major of-
fices and can be picked up at
the same places. To be eligible
for a major office, a student
must have earned at least 60
credits and must be a full-time
student.

“ Applicants for president must
have served (or attended 50
per cent of the meetings of the
AWS council for at least one
year and have a 2.75 QPA.

is the chairman of Housing

The second vice-president is
chairman of Freshman Council,
must have served on that com-
mittee and have a 2.75 QPA.

Applicants for secretary and
treasurer must have served on
AWS Council and have a 2.50
QPA.

In addition to the elected of-
fices, there are a number of
committees which act to make
up the rest of AWS Council.
These committees are activities,
constitution and by-laws, elec-
tions, Judicial Board, Lantern
Night, off-campus housing, pub-
lice relations, scholastic inter-
ests, traditions, and transfer.
Committee forms will be avail-
able after the AWS elections

though Mrs. Lord emphasized
that it will be open to all under-
graduates. Smoking rooms, a
rare book collection, a reference
section, a. periodical section, and
123 graduate carrels are includ-
ed in this library. The carrels
will be assigned to graduate
students doing research work-
such as carrels in the old Open
Stack Library were assigned.
Each library wil have its own
circulation department and will
be equipped with about a. thou-

Seventy-eight faculty s t u d y

Joins County Program

The UniVersity’s Director
of Staunton Clinic, Dr. Rex
A. Pittenger, will leave his
campus duties for one year
to become administrator of
Allegheny County’s Mental
Health and Mental Retard-
ation Program (MHMRP).

Announcement of the
shift was made jointly by
Chancellor Wesley W. Pos-

,g~Var and the Allegheny Coun-

ty Board of Commissioners.

Director of Staunton Clinic
since 1955, Dr. Pettenger also
serves as Staunton Clinical As-
sociate Professor of Psych.iatry
at the University’s School of
Medicine. .

The new MHMRP administra-
tor was one of the original mem-
bers of the County’s Mental
Health and Mental Retardation
Board when it was first formed
a year ago. The appointment
climaxes a year-long search for
an administrator whose chief
duty will be the coordination

DR. REX A. PITTENGER
New MHMRP Administrator

and development of community
mental health services through-
out the County.

In announcing the appoint-
ment, the County Comrnissiaon
ers issued the following state-
ment:

“The Board of County Com-

missioners of Allegheny County
is pleased to announce the ap-
pointment of Dr. Rex A. Pitten-
ger as administrator of the Al-
Retardation Program. We feel
that in making this appointment
we have selected a person who
has outstanding qualiﬁcations
for this position and that under
his leadership and guidance Al-
legheny County Mental Health
legheny County will develop the
highest quality program to
which its citizens are rightfully
entitled.

“Dr. Pittenger and his Board
will have our complete support
and backing. We intend to imple-
ment the Mental Health and Re-
tardation Act of 1966 to the best
of our ability, having in mind
that it is a partnership program
between the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and Allegheny
County and that the County will
require the fullest cooperation
of the state in all respects in
order to attain the highest qual-
ity program.

“If this takes place, Allegheny
County will have not only a pro-
gram and plan of which it can
be proud but also one of which
the whole state will also be
proud. We wish Dr. Pittenger
great success in his new posi-
tion.”

Mental Health and Mental Re-
tardation Boa-rd Chairman Da-
vid J anavitz was quoted as fol-
lows:

“The Mental Health and Men-
tal Retardation Board of Alle-
gheny County is very pleased to
have the Board of County Com-
missioners of Allegheny County
appoint Dr. Rex A. Pittenger to
the post of administrator of the

. Mental Health and Mental Re-

tardation Program. The Board
has been constituted since June
of 1967 and has devoted a great
deal of time to the selection of
a qualiﬁed administrator, hav-
ing interviewed many persons of
high caliber but having been
unsuccessful in obtaining the
right person for this tremendous
job.

“Although it would have been
well to have chosen an adminis-

trator somewhat earlier, it be-
lieves that the choice that has
been made by the Board of Com-
missioners is one that more
than offset-s the lateness of the
appointment. Dr. P-ittenger as
administrator will have the full
support and backing of this
Board and we feel sure that un-
der his guidance, direction and
leadership, Allegheny County
will not only have an outstand-

king Mental Health and Mental

Retlarda-tion Program but will
have one that will be a model
not only for the state of Penn-
sylvania but for the entire coun-
try.

“The Board wishes to thank
the Board of County Commis-
sioners of Allegheny for the

. splendid support it has given to

the establishment of this pro-
gram and particularly to the
fact that it recognized the need
-to increase the salary stlandards
so that persons of the highest
necessary qualiﬁcation-s could be
had for these positions.”
Chancellor Posvar, comment-
ing on the new assignment, said:
“We are pleased to be able to

' provide professional guidance to

an important agency of the Al-
legheny County government and
to the people of the area which
the University serves. Dr. Pit-
tenger’s appointment comes
shortly after the assignment of
Dr. Waldo L. Treuting to the
County Health Department last
summer. We feel certain that
Dr. Pittenger will provide val-
uable leadership to the Alle-
gheny County Mental Health
and Mental Retardation Pro-
gram in fashidning an inte-
grated and effective plan for
mental health care, a field of in-
creasing urgency calling for
careful planning -and coordin-
ated action. The University is
hopeful that this kind of inter-
relationship with the community
will continue in the future.”
The County Mental Health
Program will be closely affili-
ated with the state network of
community mental health pro-
grams designed to provide care
within speciﬁc geographic areas.

News Correspondents Discuss Candidates, Vietnam

The real possibility of a

~ Republican presidential vic-

tory in 1968 was one of the
main contentions made at
the annual presentation of
the ABC News Correspond-
ents 'I‘~our sponsored by the
World Affairs Council last week
at the Hilton Hotel.
“Collectively, it looks as if

the Republicans could just mass- -

acre President J ohns-on,” stated
ABC Roving Political Editor
William H. Lawrence. “The only
troufble is that they have to sit
down and pick a candid-ate. Un-
fortunate-ly, the candidate will
have to be picked by a Republi-
can convention, and you all
know what they can do.”

As to whether Johnson will
seek re-election, Lawrence re-
marked, “Eighteen months ago,
I said I had my doubts about
whether Johnson would be a
candidate. I still have my doubts.”
He cited ABC White House Cor-
respondent Frank Reynolds as
quoting former Press Secretary
Bill Moyers as saying, “If he

can walk, he'll run.”

In discussing the possible con-
tenders for the Republican pres-
idential nomination, Lawrence
felt that Richard Nixon was un-
questidnably the front - runner.
As for New York Governor Nel-
son A. Rockefeller, “He might
be popular with people, but you
get nominated by delegates, and
delegates aren't people.”

Lawrence felt that Johnson
would win over Nixon, but that
if California Governor Ronald
Reagan, “whose only qualiﬁca-
-tion I've heard so far is that he
might win,” was to oppose John-
son, “I think Reagan could beat
him.”

The second key subject dis-
cussed by the correspondents
was Vietnam. ABC Saigon Cor-
respondent Bill Brannigan made
the following statement: “While
military success has been grow-
ing in Vietnam, political suc-
cess hasn’t gotten off the ground.
The new government officials

elected last fall don’t appear
likely to do the job. If Saigon
doesn’t get into business in the
year ahead and peace talks are-
n't held, I can only recommend
that the United States drive the
lb€'S't bargain it can and get out
of Vietnam.”

John Scali, ABC State Depart-
ment correspondent, disagreed
with Brannigan: “Despite the
cost in blood and the money, I
believe we're on our way to win-
ning this struggle, if We have
the wisdom and determination
to ﬁnish this task.”

vnnuary 12.1 196

Dr. Pit-tenger and his staff will
spend the ﬁrst six months evolv-
ing a plan for the development
of these services in the ten geo-
graphic units of Allegheny Coun-
ty. The state will give ﬁnal ap-
proval to operational plans for
administration by July 1.

Dr. Pittenger expressed en-
thusiasm for the new assign-
ment. “For the ﬁrst time,” he
said, “someone is being given
the opportunity and the respon-
sibility to plan coordinated com-
munity services for the mental-
ly ill and for the mentally re-
tarded person.

He explained that  the past, i

mental health services in Alle-
gheny County, while effective in
many areas, have “just grown”
without being related to each
other or to the need in any plan-

- ned way.

Mayview State Hospital has
offered care for Pittsburgh resi-
dents, while Woodville ‘State
Hosp-ital has provided care for
residents outside the city. St.
Francis Hospital, with a large
private service, has don-e much
public service and for years has
provided emergency service to
psychiatric patients in the hands
of the police and to others from
all sections of the County.

The University's Western Psy-
chiatric Institute and Clinic has
pr-ovided services while also pro-
viding training for psychiatrists,
physicians, nurses and others
since 1951. WPIC administers
the privately-endowed outpatient
Sltaunton Clinic for adults. Pitts-
burg Child Guidance Center has
been growing since 1921, while

Craig House Technoma has-

emerged in recent years with an
active outpatient and training
program. Council House pro-
vides social activities and other
.services to form-er mental inpa-
tients. In addition, there are sev-
eral smaller inpatient units and
oustpatient services in the Coun-
«ty for both adults and children.
The Pennsylvania Association
for Retard-ed Children Work-
shops, Western State School, and
other units have provided assis-

_tance for the retarded.

Dr. Pittenger said passage of
the State Mental Health and
Mental Retardation Act of 1966,
setting up the County Mental
Health .-and Mental Retardation
Board with an administrator,
provides for -the first time a me-
chanism for planning and car-
rying out effective coordination
of existing units as well as de-
veloping of new services. Reg-
ulations now in preparation un.
der the same Act are expected
to provide the mechanism for
state support of the purchase of
some services, and of deﬁcits in
those programs which are part
of the approved plan. Most coun.
ties throughout the state have

‘Dr. R. Pittenger Takes One Year Leave

set up mental health and men-
tal retardation boards during‘
the past year and -approximately
a dozen have named administra-
tors.

Allegheny County’s new ad-
rninistrato-r said that during his
year in the post, he and his
staff will visit all related agen-
cies to confer on their relation-
ship to the program. The pro-
gvrarn will also relate to the new
Community Mental Health Cen-
ters established at Western Psy-
chiatric Institute and Clinic and
at St. Francis Hospital. Estab-
lifshmenrt of similar Centers i-n
other areas is also planned. It is
anticipated that these Centers
will in time develop appropriate
services for the retarded as well
as the mentally ill.

Dr. Pittenger said the new
program will also need to relate
appropriately to the Behavior
Clinic in the County Court sys-
tem and to the imaginative Men-
tal Health Consultation pro-
girams -in the County Health De-
partment. Further, the new pro-
gram will look for ways to tie
the activities of the‘ state hos-
pitals and schools into the com-
munity programs in whatever
ways are found appropriate.

It is hoped that by making

available preventive treatment ‘

earlier in the course of an ill-
ness, as well as more convenient-

ly closer to home, the necessity A

for major treatment will be re-
duced. , ‘

As chairman of an ad hoc
committee on the lvﬂ-IMR Board
during -the past year, Dr. Pitten-
ger was instrumental in work-
ing out an agreement among
n-ine area hospitals to share the
load of emergency psychiatric
patients in the hands of police
which was swamping the facil-
ities of St. Francis Hospital.

Dr. Pittenger’s high-er educa-
tion began at DeBauw Universi-

pty, Greencastle, Ind., where he

received a B.A. degree in 1940,
followed by an M.D. degree
from the University of 
ta in 1949. After serving an in-
ternship at Charles Miller Hos-
pital in St. Paul, he spent three
years in psychiatric training at
the University of Ohicago Clin-
ics. He received certiﬁcation
with the American Board of
Psychiatry and Neurology’ in
1955.

Pittsburgh Resistance
Holds Demonstration

A support demonstration at the Pittsburgh Federal Building will
be held when Ted Marsh, 23, refuses induction into the armed forces
on Tuesday. Marsh was one of 14 who turned in their draft cards at
the Pittsburgh Resistance Ceremony on December 4.

As a result of turning in his draft card to the attorney general,
Marsh, who had been working with emotionally disturbed children
lost his job. He is presently teaching in an area high school.

Marsh has issued the follow-
ing statement of why he refuses
to be inducted: “There came a
point when the outrages of the
Vietnam War and the use of the
draft to support irresponsible
foreign policy became too great
to bear in_silence. No longer can
we afford the luxury of exempt
classifications. No longer can we
suffer our friends and fellow
Americans being forced, against
their will, to fight and die in a

ludicrous war of aggression. No

longer can we stand by while the
South Vietnamese are herded in-
to ‘concentration camps called
“strategic hamlets.” We had been
pushed into the political sidelines
and we had to stand up and be
counted."

. The support demonstration will
begin at 6:30 a.in. atthe induc-
tion center at Liberty and Grant
streets. The early hour is neces-
sitated by the arrival of inductees
at 7 a.m.

The sponsors of the demon-
stration, known as the Pittsburgh
Resistance, have emphasized that
there will be no attempt to block-
ade the induction center and that
the inductees will not be inter-
fered with as they attempt to re-
port.

Scheduled speakers at the dem-
onstration include Rt. Rev. Msgr.
Charles Owen Rice, Dr. James G.
Holland, Keith Bromberg, and
other members of the Resistance
and its supporters.

1968: ITS CAUSE AND CURE

Are you still writing “1967” on your papers and letters?
I'll bet you are, you scamp! But I am not one to be harsh
with those who forgot we are in a new year, for I myself
have long been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my
senior year at college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until
nearly November of 1874! (It turned out, incidentally,

not to be such a serious error because, as we all know, 1874 ~

was later repealed by President Chester A. Arthur in a ﬁt
of pique over the Black Tom Explosion. And, as we all
know, Mr. Arthur later came to regret his hasty action.
Who does not recall that famous meeting between Mr.
Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr. Arthur said, “Lou,
I Wish I hadn’t of repealed 18743’ Whereupon the French
emperor made his immortal rejoinder, “Tipi que nous et
tyler tu”. Well sir, they had many a good laugh about that,
as you can imagine.)

But I digress. How can we remember to Write 1968 on
our papers and letters»? Well sir, the best way is to ﬁnd
something memorable about 1968, something unique to ﬁx
it ﬁrmly in your mind. Happily, this is very simple be-
cause, as we all know, 1968 is the ﬁrst year in history that
is divisible by 2, by 5, and by 7. Take a pencil and try it:
1968 divided by 2 is 984; 1968 divided by 5 is 393%; 1968
divided by 7 is 2811/7. This mathematical curiosity will not
occur again until the year 2079, but we will all be so busy
then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur bi-centenerary
that we will scarcely have time to be writing papers and
letters and like that.

V\W““®oa\»\-us

Another clever little trick to ﬁx the year 1968 in your
mind is to remember that 1968 spelled backwards is 8691.
“Year” spelled backwards is “racy? “Personna” spelled
backwards is “Annosrep? I mention Personna because I
am paid to write this column by the makers of Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades, and they are inclined to
withhold my check if I omit to mention their product.

Not, mind you, that it is any chore for me to sing the
praises of Personna, for it is a seemly blade that shaves
you cleanly, a gleaming blade that leaves you beaming, a
trouble-free blade that leaves you stubble-free, a match-
less blade that leaves you scratchless. If you are tired of
facial slump, if you are fed up with jowl blight, try
Personna today . . . available both in double-edge style and
Injector style. And if I seem a bit excessive in my admira-
tion for Personna, ‘I ask you to remember that to me
Personna is more than a razor blade; it is also an employer.

But I digress. We were speaking of the memorable as-
pects of 1968 and high among them, of course, is the fact
that in 1968 the entire House of Representatives stands
for election. There will, no doubt, be many lively and inter-
esting contests, but none, I’ll wager, quite so lively and
interesting as the one in my own district where the lead-
ing candidate is none other than Chester A. Arthur!

Mr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the ﬁrst ex-president to
come out of retirement and run for the House of Repre-
sentatives. John Quincy Adams was the ﬁrst. Mr. Adams
also holds another distinction: he was the ﬁrst son of a
president ever to serve as president. It is true that Martin
Van Buren’s son, VValter “Blinky” Van Buren, was at one

' time offered the nomination for the presidency, but he,

alas, had already accepted a bid to become Mad Ludwig
of Bavaria. James K Polk’s son, on the other hand, be-
came Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fillmore’s son went into
aluminum siding. This later became known as the Mis-
souri Compromise.

In Missouri, or anywhere else, there is no compromise
with quality in Personna or in Personna’s partner in
shaving pleasure—- Burma-Shave. Burma-Shave comes
to you in regular or menthol. Try it. You’ll ﬁnd it soaks
rings around any other lather.

"Some of the engineers who graduated before me
complained that their education didn't mean much
in their jobs. That's notwhat I wanted,” says IBM's
Jim Carr. (Jim is a Manager of Mechanical Process
Engineering.)
"At IBM I knew I'd be using what I learned. There's so

much diversity here that you can usually work in the speciﬁc
area you choose. In my own case, I majored in Mechanical
Engineering and minored in Metallurgy. Today my ME degree
means more than ever. And I often use my metallurgical
background. For example, I'm now working on a process
development program that requires a knowledge of machine
design, metallurgy, heat transfer, and chemistry, all of which

I studied in school.

“Another good thing about IBM's diversity is that it

creates an interdisciplinary environment. You get a chance

to work with and learn from people in many. different ﬁelds.
Since our industry is growing so fast, the people you talk to

are likely to be working at state—of—the-art levels or beyond."

There's a lot more to the IBM story than Jim has mentioned.

Colleges Are No Longer Parents.

Doctrine of ‘In Loco Parentis’ Changes

(ACP)—The role of the
college or university as a
substitute parent for its stu-
dents is slowly crumbling.

The doctrine of “in loco
parentis,” based on a long-
held notion that the educa-
tional institution can and
should act “in place of a
parent,” is being modified
slightly in some schools, re-
jected completely in others.

Changes are being seen in
every -area encompassed by the
doctrine:

Curfews for women.

Visitation in dormitories and
apartments.

Consumption of alcoholic bev-
erages on and off campus.

Place of residence (i.e., al-
lowing students to live in off-
-campus apartments versus re-
quring them to live in college-
supervised dormitories).

Many students regard in loco
parentis asarchaic, and student
newspapers have led the cru-
sade to tear it from its entrench-
ed position as the foundtion of
the system of social reguations
an-d replace it with an ‘updated,
more realistic View of the stu-
dent’s non-aca.demic life.

On the day when social regu-
lations and counseling services
were to be scrutinized by the

deans of Valparaiso (Ind.) Uni- ,

versity at am All-Student Con-
gress, the school newspaper, the
Torch, editorialized:

“People who accepted the loco
parentis function of the college
formulated a system to shelter
naive students from the evil in-
ﬂuences of the real world and
to inculcate in them a moral
code for eventual contact with
adult society.”

While granting that the “pa-
ternalistic" system “sprang from
a genuine concern for the wel-
fare and maturation of stu-
-dents,” -the Torch called it “un-
workable at VU today.”

“It is Imrealistic to believe
that three social deans and a
handful of dormitory directors
can act as father and mother to
4,000 students, even when aided
by big brother and big sister
counselors. It would be almost
physically impossible to enforce
regulation in the current Hand-
book for Students, a model of
overprotective thinking.”

 

    

‘R|OT!'

This was the cry that shook
the Buffalo streets last June.
For three days a miniature Hell
developed in the Negro ghetto.
Only after it was over, was the
question asked: “Why?”

Dr. Frank Basag in his new
book, Anatomy of a Riot seeks
the answers. This book lays
bare the soul of a city and
documents the hate and frus-
tration that produces a urban
riot.

At the Valparaiso Congress,
during which the students were
surprised by the «announcement
that curfews for senior women
would soon be abolished, Dean
of Students Luther Koepke ex-
plained the philosophy underly-
ing rules at Valparaiso.

Three kinds of rules are en-
forced, Koepke said: “moral
rules from the Bible or from
God (teaching students Chris-
tian ethics is a AU object-ive),
civil rules which must be obey-
ed as the edicts of authority, and
-social rules enforced to insure
orderly living conditions.”

Studqnts are not allowed to
make all their own rules, the
Torch quoted Koepke as saying,
because they have not yet been
“tempered by history and ex-
perience.”

Social regulations (and the
philosophy -behind them) are
one target of the student power
movement, and some changes
can be attributed in part to the
activists, but others have come
solely by administrative decree
in recognition of the temper of
the times.

Grinnell (Ia) College abolish-
ed all women’s houans this fall
in the belief, President Glenn
Leggett said, that “any regula-
tion of college women's hours
. . . is a matter of security rather
than morality and that reason-
able security can be secured . . .
without the necessity of the col-
'lege’s maintaining an azrbitriary
hours system.”

Dean of Women Alice 0. Low
said justification of women’s
curfews was increasingly diﬂ:‘i-
cut since neither contemporary
parental practices nor education-
al philosophy supports nsuch reg-
ula-tion.

Michigan State University and
the University of Minnesota re-
cently eliminated curfews for all
dormitory w-omen except fresh-
men, who are generally thought
by administrators to require a
period of adjustment between
the assumed regulations of home
to the complete freedom of a
no-hours policy.

Western Michigan University,

Kalamazoo, extended dorm clos-
ings to 2 a.m. for juniors and
seniors and began a senior wom-
en's hall with no hour restric-
ltions. But despite the improve-
ment over the old system, the
Western Herald vv!asn’t satisﬁed.
The newspaper urged the uni-
versity to follow Michigan
St-a‘te’s example.

Hours for senior women at
Wartburg College, Waverly, 1a.,
were liberalized by the initiation
of a key system for senior wom-
em but some vestiges of the old
system remained: disciplinary
probation (with no appear) for

_ lending the key to an ineligible

coed and a stiff $25 penalty for
losing the key.

Still other schools are pu.sh-
ing for change. At the Universi-
ty of North Carolina, a referen-
dum last spring showed, the
Daily Tar Heel said, that “a
majority of coeds here favor ex-
tension of closing hours, elim-
ination of closin.g hours for sen-
iors, liberalization of the over-
night sign-out system for girls
who have blanket parental per-
mission, and the option to live
in off-campus housing fo coeds
who are either seniors or 21’
years old.”

The Tar Heel suggested that
the dean of women look not to
-the results of an alumni survey
but to other schools for guide-
lines in building a new system
of women’s rules.

Women's hours “bug” dorm
residents, but they’re equally
dissatisﬁed with policies govern-
ing visitation. -.

Debate over open houses and
open doors is nothing new; it
has been several years now since
the well-publicized case of the
male dorm residents, who re-
-belling against a policy requir-
ing doors during visitation to be
open the width of a book, sub-
stituted matchbooks for text-

books.

Since then debate has been
sporadic but often intense. This
fall at the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley, Dean of Stu-
dents A-rleigh Williams “extend-
ed from two to ten the number
of residence room visits per-
mitted each month by members
of the opposite sex,” according
to a Daily Californian report.

The extension was not greet-
ed as enthusiastically as might
have been expected, however——
it was coupled with stipulations
“that all guests be escorted up-
stairs by their hosts, and that
doors to rooms of all participat-
ing students remain wide open
at all times.”

Lela Zillis, president of Free-
born Hall, called the require-
ment of wide doors a “ri-diculous
invasion of p-riv'.acy.”

“If we're judged mature
enough to be permitted ten open
doors a month, then we should
be likewise trusted to entertain
/guests with the doors close ,”
she said. “With the privacy af-
forded by an open door we
might as well sit in the lobby.”

The administrative view on
open doors inevitably takes into
account the possibility that the
public would view a policy as
encouragement of licentiousness.

The University of Maryland
-doesn't “look upon dormitories,
bedrooms and sitting rooms as
a place for closed-door intervis-
itation,” President Wilson H. El-
kins said in the Diamondback.

Citing “a responsibility to par-
ents and the public generally,”
Elkins put his foot down on the
closed-door recommendation in
a student proposal concerning
regulations, saying the recom-
mendation “put sex overt-ones”
on the proposal.

A target at still other schools,
among them South Dakota State
University and North Texas

State University, is a policy pro
hibiting students" in off-campus
apartments from having visitors
of the opposite sex.

And then there's the question
of whether students should be
allowed to live in apartments at
all. Until recently, coeds -at the
University of ‘North Carolina
were not permitted to live in
apartments. Now, senior women
have that privilege.

And there's the case of the
freshman coed at a Minnesota
college who was required to
move into a dormitory even
though -her home was a block
from the campus.

At Texas Technological Uni-
versity, Lubbock, 34 male stu-
dents took to the courts to ﬁght
a rule requiring them to live
on campus.

The students were denied per-
mission to register this fall be-
cause they were not residents in
campus housing, the University
Daily reported. They ﬁled an in-
junction against the university,
claiming ﬁnancial inability to
live in dlormi-tories.

And after weeks of arbitra-
tion, the students succeeded in
getting an appeals system es-
tablished to consider such cases
and -grant permission to live off
campus in some instances.

“Much more is involved,” the

Daily commented, “than the
right of 34 students to live off
campus this fall, as both sides
of the suit realize. The case is
one of nation-wide precedence
and importance, affecting apart-
ment owners, school administra-
tors and bond holders in every
city in the nation with a college
or university campus.

“School administrations are
involved not only for ﬁnancial
reason, but because the entire
in loco parentis philosophy un-
derlies the case.

not hard to confuse names, teams, and places. One notice-
able absence was that of any Panther football players,
especially All-East Bob Longo. Case in point: In the Hula
Bowl, one of the starting ends was John Wright of Illinois.
When the Panthers faced the Illini, _it wasthe opinion of
all the Illinois writers that Longo"'was better than Wright.
The same opinion is shared here. Why was Longo ex-
cluded? - -  ,.

A roadweary Panther basketball team returns to its
home court for only the second time this season tomorrow

season, 267; ﬁeld goals maca-

ﬁrst.

Burdened down by a 2-5 record after Wednesday's loss

at Westminster, the cagers
are looking for some of the
of the same home court magic
that carried them to a stunlning
80-63 upset victory ove.r highly
rated Temple. The Penn State
«game starts at 3:30 p.m. follow-
ing the fresh game with Point-
Park.

The Nittany Lions have won
seven straight from the Jungle
Cats, and have a veteran crew
back. Led by hot shooting guard
Jeff Persson, asnd 6’8” forward
Bill Stansﬁeld, they carry a 44
reco-rd into tom~ocr.row’s contest.

State, uses a pressing zone’

defense similar to Temple’s, and
Timmons believes that the same
type of effort that beat the Owls
will be necessary against the
Nittany Lions.

In the Terruple game, the Pain-
vthers win was summed up suc-

cinctly by losing coach Ha.-rry
Litwack. “They outhustled us
and outshot us, and that was
that,” he said.

The Panthers’ hot outside
shootirng forced Temple out of
its zone, while a tight defense
stymied Owl star Clarence Bnook-
ins and enabled the Panthers to
control the defensive boards
against the much taller Owls.

But, on the’ road the cagers
have not been nearly so impres-
sive. The 81-72 loss to Westmins-
ter was marked by sloppy ball-
handling that cost the Panthers
numerous scoring opportunities.
“We threw the ball away too
many times without getting a
shot,” moaned Timmons.

Timmons did n:ot moan about
the _offici«ating, which was worse
than the Panather’s balllhandling.

Panthers’ AllAmerican ‘
Hennon to be onored

Don Hennon, the Panthers
basketball All-American,
will be honored tomorrow
by the Pittsburgh Basket-
ball Writers Association.

The former cage star will be
cite-d for “outstandiin-g achieve-
ment both on and off the basket-
ball court." He will be honored
at halftime of tomorrow's Penn
State basketball game at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

Hennon rates as one of the
finest “little men” to ever play
basketball in the district. Hen-
non was a two-tim-e ﬁrst-team
All-American in 1958 and 1959,
twice leading the Panthers to
the NCAA tournament. The 58%
former Wampum High star
holds 10 of 13 all-time school
scoring records.

As the top scorer in the
school's history, Hennon holds
the following records: points in

‘one game, 45: points in one sea-

son, 651; points in a career, 1,-
841; season average, 26.0; ca-

A. V_Dave Adams is going home
this weekend. However, it is
_~ unlikely that the varsity
_' ‘wrestling coach wil be welcomed

it to Navyis-n’t a friendly one.

8, ~‘I’d sure like to knock them
off,” chimed Adams, who-like
foiovtball coach Dave. Hart——was
‘an assistant coach at the Naval
-Academy before accepting the
head coaching position here. But
.the.prospects for a win at A.nna-
. polls tomorrow are dimlbecause
5 1 “Navy has the best club they've
had in years. It’s probably their
best in the post-war era.”

Even before Adams takes his
squad to Navy, he’s got to wor-
ry ab-out the M.arlyland team the
ygrapplers face tonight at Col-
lege Park. Although the coach
, feels that two ma.tches in less

4 than 24 hours won't hurt the
team, there are other consider-
 ations. 1

:“Maryland also has their best
club in years,” explained the
coach.» “They only lost to Le-
high, 22-8, and three of their
‘starters didn't wrestle. I don’t
think they would have beaten
Lehigh with them, but it would
~ have been a real close match.”

tonight. Still, Adams thinks his

“We’re not bad, not bad at
all,” emphasized Adams. “Ove-r-
all there’s agood attitude. The
boys are enthusiastic about
wrestling. Some are not the
most talented, but they’re_ hust-
ling. I think coach (Bob) Feh-I‘S
has been a ﬁne inﬂuence.

“If our kids make a good
showing on this trip,” he added,
“I think we’ll throw a scare into
somebody. One of these days
we'll catch somebody sleeping
and kmock them off.”

Actually, the wrestlers are
coming off a busy vacation. Just
before ﬁnals they. defeated St.
Francis, 18-14, and several var-
sity and freshmen wrestled in
the Wilkes Holiday Tournament.
Last Saturday they dropped a
narrow 20-14 decision at Temple.
Despite the loss, Adams seemed
happy with his team.

“Although we didn't take any
titles (in the Wilkes Tourna-
ment), I was real pleased with
our performance,” said the
coach. “I think the break for va-
cation helped them. The boys
started doing things they hadn’t
been doing befo-re. I think they
gained a lot of conﬁdence.

“They’ve improved right.
along,” Adams continued.

“Against Temple they wrestled
the best they have all season.
If‘ it wasn’t for a. couple small
mistakes, we’d have had a vic-
tory.”

As a result, Temple won three

of four individual bouts that
were decided by two points or
less. However, the match wasn’t
clinched until the 191 pound

match when Terry Hoover was
pinned. 0

“Terry just made a little mis-
take and wound up on his back,”
offered Adams. “Tim Trax made
two mistakes that cost him four
points.” Trax lost a. 10-9 deci-
sion. 0

Trax has his work cut out for’
him tomorrow at Annapolis. He
faces John Kent, a, runner-up in
last year's Easterms at 160. Yet,
Adams feels Trax can’t be count-
ed out because of his continued
improvement. I

Last year Terry Hoover was
the vars~ity’s only winner against
Navy as the Midshipmen romp-
ed 31-3. However,'Terry might
have a hard time repeating be-
cause the grappler he decision-
ed, Terry Allen, is reportedly
vastily improved.‘ A

One other wrestler from the
football team —— Tony Truitt ——
could become Adams’ trump
card. Truitt has won his, only
match of the year, a 6-2 deci-
sion at Temple, and the coach is
high on him. ‘ 
“He wrestled at Wilkes,” said
Adams, “and as soon as he gets
some experience, he’ll be a good
heavyweight. He didn't have

~ anybody to work with before.

Now Ralph Cindrich (freshman)
is out.

“Truitt has two to-ugh ones
coming up. If he can Win, he’ll
be pretty tough.” \

Adams could have said the
s-ame about his whole team. To-
night and tomorrow they have
two tough ones. Like the coach
said, maybe they’ll catch some-
one sleeping. Maybe in Adams’
old backyard.

It is often in sports com-
-petition a team doesn’t win,
it loses; it l—oses by making
mistakes. If a team makes more
mistakes than its oppo-nent it
will lose; if i-t doesn’t, the other

pk team will lose. Coach Tim Grgu-
ri-ch’s freshman basketball team

. has been making many mis-
takes. And because of this, his
team has been losing.

Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
p.m. in the Field House, the
Cubs will be looking for their
first win of the young 1968 sea-
son. Their opponent will be the
Point Park Junior Varsity.

“Point Park shouldn’t be too
much of ‘a problem," said Grgu-
rich conﬁdently.

Grgurich could be right. But
if his team continues to play as
' y_as.théy ham.

  

Grsurich ,

      

could be in for a rude awaken-
ing similar to the one he suf-
fered Wednesday night against
the Westminster Junior Varsity.

“I never expected to lose to
Westminster,” explained Grgu-
rich with disappointment, “but
they kept ‘coming at us with
pressure offense and defenses
that caused us to make mis-
takes. We threw 000 many pass-
es away.”

The Cubs lost to the Westmin-
ster JV in overtime, 70-64. They
were charged with 28 fouls,
while Westminster only commit-
ed 12. But the co-stly turnovers,
especially in the ﬁve-minute
overtime period hurt more.

“We lost on mistakes,” repeat-
ed Grgurich, “not on fouls.”

In an evening balanced scor-
ilng attack, 6-6 Bob Gailius was
with 18 points. Mike

and Mike Paul (13) also hit for
double ﬁgures in the losing
cause.

The opening game of the sea-
son was played during the vaca-
tion break, Jan. 3. In that game
the Cubs were outplayed by Rob-
ert Mo-rris Junior College, 84 67.

“We lost to Robert Morris be-
cause of mistakes also," explain-

ed Grgurich, “but we expected

them to be tough.”

Certainly the Cubs could lose
to Point Park if they make as
many mistakes as they have,
whether Grgu-rich expects to or

not.

“We can’t afford to play poor-
“be—
cause we don’t have any big
animals that are going to keep

But the coach expects improv-
ed play tomorrow afternoon,

and the Cubs will try to prov

him right

Gymnastic Team Set 

To Tackle Springfield
At Trees Hall Tonight

by CHUCK DWORAK
For the second time, the gymnastic team may feel the
brunt of a recent Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference
ruling. The ECAC, meeting in New York Dec. 14, ruled that freshmen
could compete in gymnastic meets but their scores would be unofficial.

The gymnastic team faces
Springfield tonight_at,7:30 p.m.
at Tree Hall. And again the rul-
ing will be in effect as it was
when the gymnasts lost to Syra-
cuse last Saturday.

Jim Provinger, a 9.55 perform-
er on the longhorse, and Tom
Pillion, an 8.9 star on the still
rings, are Springfield’s top ath-
letes.

l“Springfield will be pretty
tough,” commented coach Neiger.
“Provinger could give Shideman-
tle a rough time on the longhorse
and they are also tough on the
trampoline with Tim Rodgers.”

“We’re just rebuilding for next
year now,” co-mmerited coach
Warren Neiger. “I have a good
crop of freshmen and I will spend
the rest of the year developing
them rather than concentrating
on wins.”

The gymnasts were 1-2 in the
meets in which the fresh scores
counted. Phil Lilly and Mike
Beatty had led the team to an
opening day victory at Cornell
Dec. .2.

At Slippery Rock, the gymnasts
‘lost, 140.19--126.28. Jim Parker

led Slippery Rock to victory on
the sidehorse with an 8.13, and
Al Cap came in first on the still
rings with an 8.66.

Dave Shidemantle, with 8.9 and
freshman Lowell Meek, with an
8.73, led the gym team to its only
win on the floor exercise.

The first home meet for the
gymnastics team resulted in a
l58.9——l26.28 loss to Army. Don
Waver led the scorers for Anny
on the parallel bars with an 8.85,
and Barry Robella, with an 8.65.
Drew Allen, at 8.6, paced Army
on floor exercise. Shidemantle's
9.6 brought the gymnasts a win
on the longhorse.

Against Syracuse last Saturday,
the gymnasts dropped a 117.25-
97.25 decision. ’

“That ruling hurt us against
Syracuse,” said Neiger.
Lilly and Mike Beatty combined

¥«z7».,:

  

for 15.5 unofficial points on the A _

floor exercise. And Bob Dodson's
3.8 was the only score that count-
for us on the sidehorse.”

Dennis Engel led Syracuse on
floor exercise with a 9.25 and
on the longhorse with 9.35.

Depthless Swimmers  

Face Bucknell In Quest     

Of Win Number Two "

by ART ROSE1\_iGARTEN
After suffering their second defeat of the season
against Syracuse during the vacation, the swimming team
hopes to return to the winning way tomorrow afternoon

when they travel to Bucknell.

Coach Bill Grant expects a rough time against Bucknell. “They
are three deep in every position and are especially strong in the free-

style where they have seven let-
termen,” he said. “The-ir extreme
depth is certainly a decisive ad-
vantage for them.”

Lack of depth has hurt the
swimmers in their two losses,
especially at the Syracuse meet.
Against the Orangemen, Grant
presented a squad of only eight
men. “This was the first time in
my career where I was not able-
to put enough men on the start-
ing blocks,” said Grant disgust-
edly. “Our diver, Dean Coleman,
volunteered and swam a leg of
the freestyle relay so that the
race wouldn’t be disqualified.”

“The boys have been lowering
their times each time out, only
to be nipped at the touch by a
bo-y who was fresher,” explained
Grant. ‘‘I am very proud of the
boys and their fine dedication
and loyalty to their university
and their team,” he says, “but at
the same time the boys and my-
self are quite disgusted by the
talk that we hear by students
who say that they can whip any
boy on the team.

“I wish that they would come
up to the pool and show me, be-

8 cause I know I could find a place

on the team for them. We cer-
tainly could use their talents,”
offers Grant.

Against Bucknell, the swim-
mers, (1-2) must pick up points
early in the meet. The Bisons
freestylers, is

the quality is lacking, because
John Lane and Pete Ream are
top swimmers, but that these
boys will be swimming in as
many as four events. “We must
swim around the freestyle events
and hit them where they are
weakest in order to gain the 57
points needed for the win,” Grant
said.

Besides the returning letter-
man in the freestyle, Bucknell
also has a strong crop of sopho-

mores. Accordingto Grant, this.
year’s Bison’s sophomore free-

style relay team was the number
one freshman relay team in the
Mid-American Conference last
year. In addition, Buck.nell has a
very fine diver in Tom Gibson,”
adds Grant.

One of the swimmers Grant
likes to compliment is Rich Fry.
Fry is the number two man be-
hind Lane in the 1000 meter free-
style. “I have to take my hat
off to him,” said Grant. “He is
still learning the skills of com-
petitive swimming while taking
on new events.” In the Syracuse
meet, Fry swam the 200 yard
backstroke for the first time.

With a little luck and contin-
ued fine performances by the
squad, a victory over Bucknell
can happen tomorrow, but as
Grant says, “I certainly could
use those ‘swimmers’ who are
sitting and talking in the dorms
to help bring us some victories.”

Season Preview

Tracksters Show Individual
Stars But Lacks Team Depth

Page 18 — THE PITT NEWS — Friday, January 12, 1968

While the other winter sport teams have been partici-
pati‘ng in meets already, the indoor track team awaits its

season opener against Kent State here January 20. '
Coach Jim Banner, in his second year as coach and rebuilder of

the indoor track sport, described
the two main aspects of this sea-
son's team. The first is an ap-
parent lack of depth in all events;
i.n some events, the trackmen

_ may not have a single entry.

On the brighter side, Banner
expects to see a good mile relay
team. The returning lettermen,
led by the school record holder
in the two-mile, Paul Greig,.
should place in the top three, at
least, in their respective events.

These lettermen include Greg
Ellis, who holds the Field House
shot put record; Roger Holly,
who’ll probably run in the 600
and 1000 yard events; and Chet
Wojiechowski, a sprinter. Also
on thl3 bright side are Dave
Brinn, Carlos Reisen and Tom
Christie in the hurdles.

This year’s schedule, which in-
cludes two dual meets, two invi-
tational meets, and the champion-
ship meets, will allow‘the team
to participate especially in the
hope 0-f gaining valuable experi-
ence. The invitational meets will
allow individuals to display their
talents.

The dual meets will be at home
against Kent State and Penn
State. Both opponents defeated
the thinclads last year; Kent by
a 58-42 score and the Lions by
the score of 74-26. A

An ‘iiiiiai-Eiiiéiiiéiit over last
year’s showing could be in store,
if Banner’s program doesn't miss.

Dibbley
Named

Iron Man

Sophomore defensive halfback
Davy Dibbley nabbed the Pan-
ther ‘Iron Man’ award for the
1967 football season.

The former New Castle High
star topped all Panther players
with 319 minutes of playing time
during the season. The second
most durable Panther player was
another defensive halfback, sen-
ior Paul Killian who saw 311 min-
utes of action.

In fact, the top seven on the
playing time list were members
of the defensive corps, a strong
indication of why the team didn’t

.exactly dominate the offensive

statistics this past fall.

The time breakdown for the
season: V

Dibbley, 319; Killian, 311; Dave

McGill Appointed Associate Trainer

said McGill accepted the position
when Howard Waite retired in
November of 1967.

“I’ve met the challenge of the
pros and would like now to be
part of the resurgence of the Pitt
athletic programs,” McGill noted
in accepting the job.

Roger D. McGill, head trainer
of the Pittsburgh Steelers for the
past five years, has returned
here to his alma mater as asso-
ciate trainer and manager of the

equipment room.
Athletic Director Frank Carver

The athletic publicity dpartment
includes Banner in its ‘New Deal’
in the school’s small sport re-
building plan.

Tomorrow the frosh team runs
against the Plebe team ‘at Navy.
The frosh, led by Jerry Richey,
also participate against the var-
sity’s dual meet opponent’s fresh-
man squad.

Although the track team as a
whole is “very thin,” according to
Banner, all-out efforts by indi-
viduals and the tempting school
records within reach of certain
competitors may make for a very
interesting season.

YMCA Sponsors Projects
In United States and Brazil

From mid-April to mid-
June, 1968, the University
YMCA will sponsor two
service-workcamp projects
—-one domestic and the oth-
er overseas. The former will
-be co-spo-nsored by VISTA, and
the students will be working
with young Apache Indians on
the White Mountain Indian Res-
ervuation near Phoenix, Ariz.

The volunteers’ main ta.sk
will be to help establish and
maintain a summer camp pro-
gram. Activiti-es will include
folk singing, dramatics, dancing
and recreation program, cook-
ing of balanced meals, arts and
«crafts, sewing, simple building
-construction and repair, and
camping, according to co-chair-
men Cindy Hirshberg and Brent
Worley. ,

The overseas project will be
held in cooperation with the
YMCA in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Uni-
versity students, together with
Brazilian students, will work
within -the W branches of Sao
Paulo with iia.-milies and poor
children. Programs will be set
up acco-rding to skills of stu-
dents involved. According to

\ G-inni Sctadler, chairman of the

Brazil project, this project is
designed to give students an op-
portunity to become involved
in ’cro-s-s-cu-ltural relationships.
Last year, University students
worked with youngsters in the
YMCA, an orphanage, and a,
blind school in Mexico. The year
before, ten students traveled to
Ecuador. Students interested in
serving with VISTA or the Peace
Corps may use this face-to-face
experience in Brazil or on the
Indian reservation as a trial

run.
Both projects will give stu-
‘ denrts an opportunity to become
involved -in a cross-cultural re-
