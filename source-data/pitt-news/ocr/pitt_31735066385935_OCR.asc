 

UESP

provides  
alternative
to classes

By Joseph Bruce
For The Pitt News

Many students dream of
classes where attendance is
not mandatory. Students in
the University External
Studies Program are part of
such a program.

UESP is an alternative for
College of General Studies
students who have difficulty
attending classes.

UESP offers more than
correspondence courses;
advising, counseling and
other services are available.
Most people use UESP to
supplement the intellectual
processes of learning, rather
than as their sole source of
education.

The average student in
UESP is in the mid—30s, has
a family and a full—time job
and may not have time to
attend class even three days
a week. UESP offers a
solution to this problem in
a way that is beneficial to all
involved.

Joanne Claus, assistant
director of operations at
UESP, said, “We are
addressing a need of adult
learners. We enable
students who have this need
for college credits and
degrees.” Some people
might assume that the are
courses are not real, which
is inaccurate, according to
Claus. A course in UESP is
personally tailored to the
specifications of the
individual course by a
curriculum specialist or a
faculty member.

UESP could be described
as “on the cutting edge of
alternate studies,” said
Samuel Brown, a UESP
student who will graduate
magna cum laude.

According to Claus, UESP
students deserve the same
respect as any other student,
and the fact that they don’t
go through college in the
traditional way means
nothing. For example, the
Pittsburgh chapter of the
Golden Key National Honor
Society enrolled Brown ——
an achievement which is
difficult to accomplish, and
he should be given the same
respect as any other student,
Claus said.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH ~

By Pat N aughton
For The Pitt News

George led a relatively normal
lifeuntil he was about 15 years
old ——- then, musical sounds
began to fill the cavities of his
head. The music had no
boundaries, striking
intermittently — day or night.

From that point on, George
had an overpowering sensation
that he was different from others,
unique in some way.

He also began to believe that
extraterrestrials would kidnap
him. i

Unsure of the meaning of the
music and too frightened to
conﬁde in his parents or friends,
George kept his secret to himself.

It wasn’t until George’s junior

year in college that the voices

replaced the music; he thought
people were following him. The
voices were always with him,
commenting on or criticizing his
every move. S

George managed to complete
a grueling undergraduate
workload and graduate from
college. He enthusiastically
anticipated the arrival of
September, when he would be
starting medical school. He had
aspirations of becoming a

WPIC offers treatment for mentally ill

successful physician.
But during his summer

vacation, he was nearly out of his ,

mind with fright. The voices
would not stop. George now felt
that some UFO was trying to
contact him. He started writing
letters to organizations involved
in UFO research, explaining his
plight and desperately searching
for answers.

He became obsessed, and
nothing could distract. him.
Finally, he withdrew totally to his
bedroom. ‘

He insisted that UFOs would
capture him if he left his bedroom.
He lost weight and did not take
a bath for 15 days. After several
attempts to reason with him failed,
his parents admitted him to

Western Psychiatric Institute and.

Clinic, where George learned that
he had schizophrenia.

Initial psychotic symptoms of
this disease often strike men
between the ages of 17 and 24.
For most young men, these ages
are the paradoxical fun—filled and
challenging days of college life.

People who are afﬂicted by
schizophrenia experience
hallucinations, delusions and
disordered thinking, and display
inappropriate emotional
expressions. They are’ often out

of touch with reality.

“lschizophrenial affects one’s
entire personality,” said Dr.
Matcheri Keshavan, inpatient-
medical director of the
schizophrenia unit at WPIC.
Emotions, thinking, behavior and
perception are all affected by this
mental illness, according to
Keshavan.

“[George] was soinsightful 
so intelligent. ‘What is happening
to my brain?’ he asked. He knew
something was wrong from the
beginning,” said Keshavan. “Many
schizophrenics lose insight into
the nature of these experiences.”

The voices were quite persistent
in George’s case.,His condition
gradually improved with
medication, and the, voices
became less of a distraction for
him, according to Keshavan. “[Hel
was very keen on going back to
medical school — I told him
perhaps in a year’s time he would
be able to go back,” said
Keshavan.

Medication is usually the first
line of treatment for
schizophrenics, according to

Keshavan. Dosage levels ares

closely monitored and are
adjusted as needed.

Upon admission to the hospital
and for a few days afterward,

patients do not receive
medication. They are -observed
for diagnostic purposes, said Dr.
Radha Kambhampati, an
attending physician on the unit.
When treatment with medication
does begin, doctors" follow the
philosophy of a “1ow—dosage
regime,” said Kambhampati, who
supervises one of three psychiatric
teams on the unit.

Kambhampati’s team consists
of two residents, a medical
student, a social worker and a
nurse. They evaluate and visit
each patient daily.

On this Monday morning, the

team huddled into an office the S

size ofa jail cell. While the medical
student leaned against a filing
cabinet because of the shortage
of chairs, members engaged in
lively conversation regarding
weekend incidents and each
patient’s progress. Afterward, they

. proceeded to the peach~colored_

bedrooms.

Their first stop was Peter’s room
(patient names have been
changed to maintain

conﬁdentiality). Dressed in his a

pajamas and robe, Peter, about

age 35, had dark stubble on his

chin and greeted the team by

jumping up and down on his

THIS DAY IN
HISTORY

April 18, 1988

allocations request for
$7,094.90 to lease a boat. John
Huber, the club's president,
said he intended on ﬁling
another protest.

first.

 

April 16 -—— An officer was
informed that‘ after April 13 it
would become the responsibility
of the campus police to take
down the U.S. ﬂag that hangs
outside the Cathedral of Learning.
The ﬂag was given to the police
by the Army Reserve Officers’
Training Corps. An officer noted
that on April 14, the U.S. flag was
missing. The ROTC still does not
have the flag.

April 16 —— A staff member of
the William Pitt Union said that
while he was working in the
recreation room, alfight broke
out between two students. One
of the students threatened the
worker. verbally, and it was

rumored that the student had a

gun in his possession.

April 16 -— A faculty member
said she discovered Room 121 of
Trees Hall was unlocked when
she went to her office in the early
morning. Once inside, she
realized that a Panasonic Video
Cassette Recorder, valued at $300,
was missing.

April 16 An officer found a
person in the Schenley Cafe

a three-quarter-inch laceration on
the tip of her thumb. The officer
dried the area, applied 4x4
pressure and controlled the
bleeding. The officer then
transported the student to
Presbyterian- University Hospital.

April 16 — A male sitting on a
bench outside the William Pitt
Union had the smell of alcohol

 

on his breath. An officer noticed
that the man was also staggering,
so the officer arrested him for
public drunkenness.

April 16 ——A studentwas talking
to a friend in the Towers Lobby
when a male approached her,
pulled her aside and started calling
her obscene names. He then
slapped the student in the face.
The student tried to escape, but
the male hit her again. The
student's friend intervened, and
the male left. The student told an
officer that this was one of several
incidents between herself and
the male. For example, in
February, the student said the
male had thrown a knife at her,
but it missed and hit the window
of the Original Hot Dog Shop.

 

CORRECTION

A story in yesterday's issue of Tbe Pitt

By Pria Bhargava
Staff Writer

The island of Lombok, Indonesia, is
home to Lalu Sudamadi, a slim, short and
very articulate graduate student studying
international affairs at Pitt.

He has been married for seven years,

has a five-year—old child, and he and
his wife are expecting another child
this month. With all of these obligations,
including a job in family planning, he
also ﬁnds time to serve as president of
the Indonesian Student Association,
which is considered by some to be one
of the most active ethnic organizations
on campus. The group aims to introduce
the Indonesian culture to the United
States through lectures, festivals and
other programs. V

When a student sees Beverly Pollock
walking on the campus of the University
of Pittsburgh, that student may think
that Pollock is a Pitt employee, or
maybe merely visiting the university.

Although she may appear older than
most, Pollock is a Pitt student, basically
the same as any other student that goes
to this institution.

“Of course, I still haven’t figured out
what I want to be when I grow up. I'm
still looking for myself,” Pollock said.

Pollock is different from other students
only in that she is not enrolled in the

College of Arts and Sciences‘ or the .

College of General Studies. Instead, she
attends the University of Pittsburgh’s

With an air of authority,
Sudamadi describes Lombok and
the rest of Indonesia by drawing

I apicture of the area on a scrap of

paper. It is a small island the size
of Bali, which is about 3,000 to
5,000 square miles, according to
Sudamadi. Of the approximately
2 million citizens, most are rice
farmers, he added.

According to Sudamadi,
Indonesia is inﬂuenced by many
different religions —- mainly
Hinduism, but also Islam,
Buddhism and Christianity. All of
the islands have a somewhat
different culture and religion. For

instance, the people of Lombok
is Hindu and believe in animism
(that everything has a soul).
“The government’s first priority,
on top of economics, is family
planning,” Sudamadi said. He has
been working with family
planning for 11' years, mainly
educating rural people and
helping them determine the size
of their families. Of the 76 million
people in Indonesia, 85 percent
of them live in rural areas,
according to Sudamadi. The
family-planning program is
voluntary, and its approach
focuses on helping people to
make their own decisions through

an understanding of the
importance of family planning.
“Unless they feel that they have
full control, it can’t be effective,”
he said. Religious and political
leaders have been invited to
encourage development of the
program. “They use their culture
and language in teaching them,”
said Sudamadi.

Family planning in the United
States seems to be just a matter of
using contraceptives, according
to Sudamadi. He feels there is a
lack of adequate information, as
only temporary aid is given.
Through education “the people
are made to see that population
is their problem  [We try to]
change the belief systems of
people, using, any kind of
communication channels,” he
said.

Last year, the president of
Indonesia won a United Nations
award for achievement in
population control. The World
Bank built international training
centers there i to help other
countries, Sudamadi added.

Sudamadi admitted with a sly
grin that before coming here, he
had a negative picture of
Americans — he thought they
were too individualistic. “In
Indonesia, everyone is in a closed
society. Our neighbors are
considered brothers and sisters,”
he said.

Until 1965, Indonesia’s
government was inﬂuenced by
the Soviet Union and China. He
said, “This prompted me to think
that the [United States] was bad.”
He said the government resented
the Peace Corps and sent them

home. The slogan of the time was
“Go to hell with your aid.”

That year, the country’s first
president was overthrown, and
the new president invited all
Western countries to help.

However, ever since he came
to the United States two years
ago, he said, his impression has
changed “ 180 degrees. Americans
are human beings. They are very
helpful; they practice how to help
other societies. As people, we are
all the same . . even if some
values are looser here.”

According to Sudamadi, the
way children are raised here is
similar to Eastern countries. “The
parents have the -same goals, even

if external pressures are different," .

he said. He now understands
why Americans are individualistic.‘
Because their society is very
advanced, they need privacy. He
realizes that Americans work hard
and want to enjoy the fruits of
their labor.

Sudamadi thinks Indonesia can

learn from America's ‘discipline
and punctuality. “The system here
is well-established, and
[Indonesians] should learn from
litl,” he said.
A On the other hand, he said that
since Americans are already socio-
economically advanced, they
should concentrate on other
things besides wealth. He said
that they should practice their
religion more and possibly
consider it an alternative to
materialism.

over-60 program for students 55
and older. Pollock, who is very
young at heart, refuses to confess
her age to The Pitt News. “Do we
have to tell the whole world [my

age]?’’ she joked. “If you don’t tell _

anybody, then people will think
that I’m your age, except for a
little gray hair."

According tojan White, director
of the over-60 program, there
were 460 students enrolled in the
program last fall term taking 597
courses, and this winter term there
are 350 students taking 461
courses. These students are
allowed to take most classes.
“Some professors don’t want
[students from the program], but
most classes are up for grabs [for
the studentsl,” White said.

In her program, Pollock only
pays $10 a class but receives no
credit. However, she is not
required to attend classes, do.
assignments or take exams in her
program. Even so, she does all
the work and takes class very
seriously.

“I'm not required to do
anything, [but] how am I going to
get everything out of [my classes]
if I don’t do the work?” she said.
“How am I going to know what I
[learned] if I don’t take the tests?
I feel that I owe it to myself to

1 take the exams. I can't do anything

unless I do it with all my heart
and soul.

nighter," she said, both laughing;

and blushing. “When you get a
little older, you study a little
harder.”

Pollock has no requirements
to ﬁll, and can take any class she
wants. Her basic emphasis is on
English and writing but she plans
_on taking courses in other subjects

' _’as well. “I intend to go to Pitt as
long as I live and take writing

courses,” she said. Once she takes
all the writing courses offered,
she claims she will take them
again. .
“There's always something to
do [at Pittl,” she said. “It’s a
tremendous challenge. Plus

keeping up with you guys —
you're so smart.”

Pollock and her husband,
Melvin, who studies art at the
Boyce campus of Community
College of Allegheny County in
Monroeville, claim that they go to
school purely for the experience
and for something to do. “We
don’t believe in just sitting still,”
she said.

Mrs. Pollock was born in
Bessemer, Ala. Her family moved
to Atlanta, Ga., when she was six.
She went to Agnes—Scott College
in Decater, Ga., in 1942. She
claims that things were much
different in the early ’40s.

went to school, but no more. It’s
interesting to see the way things
have changed. School is better

the second time around.”

Pollock quit in her third year at

the age of 20 to marry Mr. Pollock.
They and their four children
moved to Pittsburgh in 1957. In
1967, when her kids were grown,
Pollock started writing for’ The
Jewish Chronicle. She became a
syndicated columnist and was

published in 19 Jewish
newspapers.

Dr. David Diehl, a resident

V physician, asked Peter how his’

weekend went.
“Bad,” he replied. “I’ve been

hallucinating. I've been seeing

little green people on the ﬂoor."
When asked what was so bad
about that, Peter replied with a
haughty laugh, “I guess it’s better
than seeing big green people.”

Once out of the room,
Kambhampati noted that Peter
had regressed over the weekend
and an increase in his medication
was necessary. A

Next, the team met with Wally,

who resembled the character
Brutus from Popeye. He had spent
the night in seclusion. He had
threatened the staff with a chair
because he wanted a cigarette.
Wally barely fit on the
uncovered twin-sized mattress
pad he was laying on. Taking up
the remainder of the space was
his breakfast tray of two blueberry
muffins and one plain bagel. No
utensils were visible. When
Kambhampati and Diehl entered,
three burly security guards
squeezed around them while they
assessed Wally’s mental state.
The rest of the team lingered,
shoulders touching, in the small

“When can I get out of here?”
asked the unshaven and brooding
Wally. Diehl asked him if he
knew why he was in seclusion.
Wally said that he wanted a
cigarette, and they wouldn't let
him have one. Diehl explained
that once he was in control of
himself, he would be moved into
a regular room.

Team members are always
direct and firm in their questioning
of the patients. Each probed the
patient’s grip of reality. Simple
questions were asked over and

man in his mid 20s. Sprawled out

for follow-up. George has been
undergoing outpatient treatment
since his discharge. Keshavan said
he saw George several times in
the hallways going to and from
his appointments. George

decided not to go into the highly‘

stressful medical ﬁeld and told
Keshavan that he is considering
doing some volunteer work in
the hospital.

While George and the others
struggle to live with this
devastating disease, Keshavan
and his colleagues at WPIC are
engaged in research projects
which aim tounderstand this
most complex and ravaging of
mental disorders.

One such study that Keshavan
is particularly excited about
focuses on first-episode, never-
medicated schizophrenics.

Early results from the pilot
phase of the study hint that brain
tissue in the forehead section
shows the same signs of
deterioration found in the aging
process. “Exactly what you see
with normal aging,” said Dr. Jay
Pettegrew, associate professorof
psychiatry and neurology and
principal investigator of this study.

Congratulations to Wilson

Pittsburgh native August Wilson who has won his
second Pulitzer Prize in three years for his drama “The

Piano Lesson.”

“Piano” is a play about a sharecropper who is willing
to sell his piano in order to buy land that his grandfather

worked on as a slave.

Wilson himself is an accomplished Pittsburgher, and is
an excellent example of a person that has has climbed his
way to the top. He is a bona fide success story and has
conquered many formidable hardships in his lifetime,
such as growing up without a father. He spent 33 years
of his life in the Hill District and dropped out of Central
Catholic High School as a 16-year-old ninth grader.
Pittsburgh has been the base for many of Wilson’s plays,
including “The Piano Lesson” and “Fences” —— for which

he also won a Pulitzer.

Although he probably doesn’t need it, we wish the best
of luck to Mr. Wilson and hope that more well-deserved
honors come‘ his way. We are sure that they will. ‘

Pondering some good

This is the time of the year
when the perspective page is
somewhat reserved for the final
remarks of outgoing editors of
The Pitt News. I’ve seen a lot of
sap on these pages over the years,
but one self-serving column
seems to be a small price for the
paper to pay for the service that
these people have given to pro-

‘ duce a newspaper with a weekly

circulation of 64,000.

The last thing anyone wants to
read, however, is a ﬁnal column.
Still, not being one to confuse
obligation with tradition, I have a
page to add to those issues in our
bound volumes and the micro-
film collection at Hillman Library
that will never again be read.

Here, then, are my ACCS (ac-
colades) and ARSES (you figure it
out) for the 1989-90 academic
year and beyond:

-ARSE —- To Wesley "Whiz-

. zer” Posvar, for his swift acquisi-

tion of the University Shop.
Despite the fact that the store has
been vacated for a month,~ the
university has yet to set foot into
the store, save to remove a couple
of newspaper clippings and a
goodbye note from previous
owner Jay McKenzie. The win-
dow display looks wonderful,
and the store will likely sell as
much, once it does open, as it has
in the past month.

-ARSE —— To Wesley Posvar

again, this time for his swift ac-
tion in dealing with the Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps’ obvious
conﬂict with the university's anti-
discrirnination policy. It’s nice to
know that hecares about all his
customers — I mean students.
The last time I looked, it was
illegal to discriminate on the basis
of sexual orientation in both the
city and university communities.

. Funny how that word “swift”

keeps popping up, too.

oACC — To the Common
Ground Coalition, for its con-
sciousness-raising efforts around
campus. The environment, ra-
cism, abortion, equal rights,
censorship; all have been ne-
glected on campus for too long.
Despite the fact that the members
of these groups get pesky at
times, it is refreshing 'to know
that they care enough to con-
tinue. -

-ARSB e Speaking of censor-
ship, here’s to all those student

_ readers who don’t like what we

print and want their opinions
published in the paper in the
form of rebuttal letters:
PPPHHH'I"I'I'l‘! Instead of blow-
ing hot air, come up and get on
staff. Find out what is involved in
publishing a newspaper.

-ACC —_ To the Pitt football
team for its valiant performance

This is a response to a rebuttal
written on April 16, 1990. The
[author of this letter] tries to point
out that KRS-1, a well-known
and respected musical artist in
the African-American community,
is a racist.  I believe you misun-
derstand him or are blatantly
wrong.

It is true that European-A"meri—
cans participated in the struggle
for civil rights, but look back and
you see mostly blacks in the
struggle getting beat down and
murdered. It was only after these
such events that a fewcivil-rights
bills were passed. As for the
Emancipation \ Proclamation, I
suggest you read up; maybe you

KRS-1 is no being  

will find out that this document
only “freed” the slaves in the
states of rebellion (nowhere else!).
After which the condition of these

1 “slaves” did not change over-.

Letters

night or 127 years later. Just say-
ing a few blacks in a few promi-
nent positions does not represent
the masses of people.

As for going back to»Africa, this
is not a “racist” concept at all. If
an Irish-American stated that all

ogical

Irish people should go back to

Ireland, their homeland, would 9

you call him a racist? No, I do not

.think so! His concept is why _

should we, as a people, continue
to live in a land that constantly .
oppresses us on so many differ- I
ent levels? I personally see a few
problems with the concept of
[returning] to Africa, but still the
reasoning is very logical.

The only thing that you should
beware of is the continuing igno-
rance on this campus. Remem-
ber, ignorance is one of the main
causes of racism.

grouped and captured its first
bowl-game victory in years un-

‘ der the tutelage of Paul Hackett.

-ACC — To Julie Shepard,

 

Matt
Martin

Student Government Board presi-
dent, who stood up to Posvar
during a Senate Council meeting
It’s about time student leaders
began poking around in places
where they do indeed belong
instead of letting the chips fall
where they may. Here’s hoping it
continues.

-ARSE -—To the university, for
its Campaign for the Third Cen-
tury, which was $26 million over

budget at the beginning of the
1990 academic year. Good fore-
sight and planning, ladeez and
gents.

-ACC —— To the university, for
abandoning the old methods of
admittance for athletes. After five

basketball players and even more

football players were denied eli-

gibility or admittance, Pitt estab-

lished new guidelines that re-
quire athletes to have a 2.3 high-
school QPA, be in the top 60
percent of their class and score a
750 on the SAT. Of course, the
university denies that the failure
of its then-incorning athletic class
had anything to do with the new
standards. Yeah, right. What re-
mains to be seen is if the guide-
lines will be followed.

-ARSE —— Tothe English de-
partment, for failing to retain L.
David Harris. Mr. Harris is the
most dedicated instructor I have
ever had the pleasure of meet-
ing. His absence will be the uni-

versity's loss. Had he been an en-
gineering or medical instructor,
you can be sure that the univer-
sity would have retained him. It
seems that there is no place for
liberal-arts majors to go anymore.
And writing, at least the non-
fiction track, is slowly being for-
gotten. As long as Pitt continues
to favor research over education,
this university will see its status
fall, and rightfully so.

-ARSE,— To the student activi-
ties officers, for the seemingly
endless series of contradictions
between policy and undertak-
ings. When students have a bet-
ter grasp of what is required in a

. siuiation than the administrators 4

do, you know there is a problem
with checks and balances.
-ARSE — To the Board of
Trustees, for backing Posvarfs
“hiring freeze” without having
adequate time to investigate the
causes and ends of the situation.
University politics‘ should never

come before the welfare of stu- 1’

dents, butthat seems to be not
only the current trend, but also
the future of Pitt, unless the sys-

tem is changed. The board needs ,

students to serve beside them,
even if in a non—voting manner.

Presentations at meetings by

concerned students and groups
are not enough. Representation
is the only way.

-ACC — To the SGB’s Michael —

Golden, for attempting to deal
with landlords in Oakland. Stu-
dents who do not receive univer-
sity housing or do not care to live
on campus are at the mercy of
most landlords and must take
what they can get. The situation
is appalling, and so are some of
the landlords. If enough prob-
lerns are brought to light, they
will have to be dealt with.

There they are. Certainly not all
of the ACCS or ARSES that could
be given have been. There’s
always next year. And if you have
a complaint, tell it to the editor.
I’m outta here.

chief of The Pitt News.

_ THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 18, 1990

Student

Continued from page 5

She also started working in
public relations for the United
Jewish Federation. After 10 years
of being syndicated and doing
public relations work, she decided
to stop the column and devote
more of her time to P.R. She
retired last June for a change of
pace and to pursue things that
were important to her, like travel
and the study of writing.

“I wanted to do things for me,”
she said. “I am in the prime of my
life. I’m having the best time that
I’ve ever had.

“In my work, I felt that I was at
the top of my mountain. Going to
Pitt, what’s happening is that I’m

on the verge of changing

mountains, and it’s thrilling and
it’s scary, because I want to see
how high I can climb.”

Pollock notes that she gets a lot

— not only out of the work, but out

of the professors and students.
She said, “I love my teachers. I
think they’re all wonderful
people. I like being around
people who are younger than I,

1 so that I can get inspiration and

keep thinking.
“In one of my writing classes,
we write short stories, hand them

out [in class] and critique them. I
like that because I get to hear
viewpoints from a different
generation than my own. When
one of the kids says that he feels
right at home with something I
wrote about that was loosely
based on my husbands family, I
find it thrilling.”

Although she feels that she has

a lot to offer the university, Pitt
has more to offer her. She recalls
a time last term when she studied
for a test for Introduction to
Dramatics. She studied hard for
the exam and was anxious to do
well. After she took the exam,
she went and checked her score.

“I noticed out of 12S.[points] I
got 115. Isaid, ‘Hey, that’s pretty
good. I bet that’s,an A.’

“Then I looked and I saw three
other kids made 115. I said, ‘Isn't
that wonderful? Four of us kids
made 11S.’~And, then I looked at
the rest of the grades, and I saw

I that 115 was the top grade. I was

so excited. I wanted to stop
somebody and say, ‘Hey, hey.
Look, look.’ But I couldn’t find a
soul. So I hurried up and ran
home and told my husband. I
was just so excitedthat I can
keep up with you guys.

“All I know is that I did good,
and that’s all that matters. It was
good for me. It showed that I can
do it. All I have to do is keep
working and trying. I can do it.”

Even though she is planning
on getting involved with some
English and writing programs at
Pitt, Pollock concentrates heavily
on her writing. Consequently,
she hasn’t had much of a chance
to involve herself with campus
programs and activities.

“I just haven’t gotten around to
it,” she said. “I’m just trying to
settle in. Give me a year. I want
to see if I can write.” ‘

Pitt sports are not too high on

the list for her, either. “I'm not
really wild about football. But I’m
happy when we win.”
Pollock / blames her lack of
extracurricular activities on her
busy family life. She has several
grandchildren and a mother who
is 92 years old.

Pollock plans to take courses .

in the spring and take the summer
off. “It’s about time I clean my

‘house. It will be the first time in
about 20 years,” she said jokingly. 9

Pollock feels that her maturity
gives her an edge when it comes
to working for grades, but feels

Thrift's pioneering techniques getting recognized

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

~ ‘Twenty years ago, a vision

unfolded in Bradenton, Fla. The
Kansas City Royals Academy, an
experimental camp with the
purpose of using the latest
technology to create a technically
perfect baseball player, opened
for business. And 1970 was a
time for questioning tradition and
for radical change in baseball’s
antiquated bureaucracy.
Unfortunately for the academy,
however, that was a time before
the computer revolution, before
graphic simulations, liquid-crystal
displays and computer-enhanced

animation became household

terms.

Thus, two years later the
academy’s founding director,
frustrated by a lack of financial
support and with no fruits from
his labors, resigned from his
position rather than compromise
his philosophy. I

A baseball maverick was born.

"Over the next 20 years, that
director, Syd Thrift,‘ assumed
scouting and teaching
responsibilities of several other

,major-league ball clubs and

attempted to implement his novel
techniques. All to. no avail,
however, as T'hrift’s “one-horse”
style was cramped by his stymying
bosses.

Cut to 1988 — Thrift has just
been dismissed as general
manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
He begins work on a book,
pleading his case for his advanced
technological techniques. The
book, The Game According to
Syd, was released earlier this year.
Thrift was in town yesterday to
talk about the book. ‘

“I've been in the process of

~ writing this book for two years,”

said Thrift. “The book was written
because of the great need for
these concepts that involve

learning, better ways of teaching
[and] better ways to analyze and
diagnose performance.”

Syd is not a novel; it is a
textbook that examines

bureaucracy in baseball, as well

as the techniques that have stood
relatively untouched for over 15
years.

But baseball has started to take
notice. The cover story in the
current issue of Baseball America
re—examines the academy and
what it produced.

‘‘I wish I knew then what I now
know,” said Royals owner Ewing
Kauffman in the article. “I would
have kept [the academy] in
existence, and we would have
had a dynasty in Kansas City. The
idea works.” 4

Some of the techniques
introduced at the academy
include:

'0 Timed—measured lead — - an

approach in which times are

calculated for the pitcher’s

. deliver)’. throw to first and the

catcher’s throw to second.
Knowing these times, and the
time it takes for a base runner to
reach second, one can ﬁgure out
exactly how much of a lead a

certain runner can take against a ‘

certain pitcher every time. .
-Four—seam fastball -—— a pitch
thrown by holding the baseball
across the “horseshoe,” which
increases the speed of the fastball
by up to four miles per hour.
0 Eye-mind-body coordination
as opposed to hand-eye
coordination. By exercising the
eyes in certain areas, one can
increase depth perception and

. concentration.

How successful are these
techniques? The academy’s team,
comprised of many athletes who
had never played baseball before,
posted a 96-13 record against
Single-A minor-league and
foreign all-star teams.

In addition, Steve Boros, who

(Editor's Note - This is the second
pan‘ of a two—pa1r feature of Pitt’s
new head football coach Paul
Hackett.)

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

Hackett took the Pitt job
thinking that he would have as
his quarterback a great athlete by
the name of Darnell Dickerson.
But when Dickerson failed to
pass an algebra course by the
end of his sophomore year, he
was declared academically
ineligible for 1989. .

Since this happened only a
short time after 1988’s backup
quarterback, Larry Wanke, had
transferred, Pittsburgh could only
mutter a collective “Uh-oh” when
looking at 1989’$ prospects.

Indeed, the only QBs now left

were transfer Scott Stark and an

afterthought by the name of Alex
Van Pelt. Van Pelt had almost
transferred to Baylor after ’88, but
his father persuaded him to stay
put in Pittsburgh and see how
things would work out.

Van Pelt ended up winning the
job in preseason camp, and with
Hackett as his master, went on to
have a season which had Pitt fans
clamoring “Darnell Who?”

As a freshman, Van Pelt passed
for 2,881 yards in 1989. That’s
five more yards» than another
pretty fair Pitt quarterback, Dan
Marino, ever threw for in one
season.

The Pitt squad was rolling along
with Van Pelt to open the season,
starting off S-O-1, including a
dramatic 31-31 tie with West
Virginia. Pitt scored 22
unanswered points in the fourth
quarter of the WVU game to gain
the deadlock.

The next two games, however,
were against the No. 1 and 2

helped develop the timed-
measured lead, managed a team
that stole 374 bases in 1974.

“Why should we not take
advantage of all the things around
us?" Thrift asked. “Why shouldn’t
we take advantage of computer-
video baseball [and] nutritional
and conditioning information?
Why shouldn’t we do more
research to improve human
performance? All the other sports
have done it.”

So why hasn't the baseball

-establishment been receptive to

the concepts?

According to Thrift, the owners
would rather pay for already-
established stars than develop
their own. That’s why the
academy closed. .

“The academy closed because
[Kauffman] was advised from
spending money on it. He had to
spend money in other places,”
Thrift said.

“There are many organizations
that use bits and pieces of the
theories,” Thrift said, “but there
are no teams that rely on it. All it

Syd Thrift's land mark baseball philosophies may be implemented in the future.

needs is for one person to step
up, or one team.”

“The Dodgers, with Boros’
commitment to teaching, are
probably the No. 1 team right
now in that respect,” said Thrift,
“but there are a number of "other

clubs too —— the Chicago White

Sox, the New York Mets [and] the
Oakland A’s. ”

Thrift now resides in Fairfax,
Va. He has been offered speaking
engagements, consulting
positions, and he has a real-

teams in the country -— Notre
Dame and Miami. The results
were not pretty for Gottfried or
anyone else associated with the
Pitt program. The Fighting Irish
and the Hurricanes pasted Pitt by
scores of 45-7 and 24-3,
respectively.

After beating East Carolina, Pitt
had to deal with archrival Penn
State on Nov. 25 at Pitt Stadium.
The game, as it turned out, would
be the beginning of the end for
Gottfried and the beginning for
Hackett. ,

With Pitt was down 13-10 late
in the fourth quarter, Gottfried
elected to kick a ﬁeld goal and go
for the apparent tie with 2:23
remaining. Ed Frazier converted
the 40-yard attempt, but Penn
State drove right down the ﬁeld
and won the game on a Ray
Tarasi field goal with :13 left on
the clock.

After Pitt’s win over Rutgers in
the Emerald Isle Classic II on

Dec. 2, the relationship between
Gottfried and the university
severely deteriorated. Gottfried
was already under ﬁre for making
noise about the losses of
Dickerson and top-recruit -‘Gary
Clayton. Clayton had an abnormal
rise on his standardized testscores
and was not admitted to the
university. Now Gottfried was
throwing a fuss over Pitt’s decision
to raise its requirements for
admittance to a 2.2 QPA and 750
SAT (up from the,NCAA level of
2.0 and 700). '

When all of this was combined
with the realization that Pitt had

gone 0-3-1 in its big games in '

1989, it became apparent that
something had to give between
Gottfried and the university.

On the afternoon of Dec. 16, it
ﬁnally did. In a shocking
transaction, the university ﬁred
Gottfried that Friday —— just 14
days before Pitt was to take its 7-
3-1 record to the John Hancock

Bowl against Texas A & M.

Hackett was named the interim“:

search was on to find a permanent

developed some of the best

be on the outside looking in.
Defensive coordinators Barry

* Heddleston situation cause for ‘red faces‘ in Athletic Dept.

Apparently, the Pitt athletic
department subscribes to the old
saying, “Better late than never.”

Yes, in yesterday’s Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, columnist Bruce
Keidan broke a story about the
dishonesty of a member of the
athletic department. It seems that
a fellow by the name of Bob
Heddleston forged a ‘signature
on a check that was supposed to
go to the Pitt cheerleaders.
Heddleston allegedly used the
money to pay off a gambling
debt.

Of course, Pitt’s AD office
jumped all over this, issuing one
of those nice, prepared
statements: “The University of
Pittsburgh has suspended Robert
Heddleston, the assistant director

of athletics for development,

pending the outcome of a
continuing internal review of the
operations of his ofﬁceff

I have my doubts as to whether
Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik had
planned to wait until April 17 to
make this announcement. It is
hard to believe that it is pure

coincidence that the
announcement just happened to
come on the day that Keidan’s
column was splashed at the top
of the sports page of the Post-
Gazette. There is some doubt in
my mind as to whether
Heddleston would have been
relieved of his duties even if
Keidan would, have never found
out about the forged check and
made it public knowledge.

A quick review of the situation,
according to Keidan, is now in
order to lend a little credibility to
that aforementioned statement.
It seems that Chauncy’s in Station
Square allegedly wrote a check
for $300 in the name of Mike
Nuzzo who, along with Theresa
Nuzzo, is in charge of the Pitt
cheerleaders. The money was to
be used to pay expenses that the
cheerleaders had accrued while
performing twopep rallies there.

In October of 1989, Mike Nuzzo
grew tired of waiting for the
money and balked when
Chauncy’s called him to do
another pep rally. Chauncy’s

responded by saying that they
had in fact written the check and
were in possession of the
cancelled check.

To make an extremely long

 

Ed
Kuznik

and complicated story short, it
seems that a Chauncy’s employee
gave that check to Heddleston,
who in turn was instructed to get
it to Nuzzo. But Heddleston
“allegedly decided to forge Nuzzo’s
name and give it to one of his

gambling buddies to whom he
owed a substantial amount of
money. Heddleston’s friend
signed the check below Nuzzo’s
forged signature and cashed it
for himself.

Mike Gottfried, who at the time
was Pitt’s head football coach,
brought the matter to Bozik’s
attention in October, according
to Keidan. Bozik responded by

‘telling Gottfried that he would
rectify the problem.

Bozik now must explain what
happened in the ﬁve months that
followed. Did he decide to place
this case in the old circular file
and hope that it would blow over
so that one of his top
moneymakers could continue to
be on the payroll? Or was he just
sitting in his office one winter
day in 1989 and decided that he
would wait until mid-April to
take some type of disciplinary
action?

Granted, the best thing to do
would be to give Bozik an ample
opportunity to explain why it
took so long to suspend

Heddleston. Bozik could then
totally refute the fact that it was
only done as a last-ditch effort to
save any kind of respect that the
AD has left.

But it seems that all calls to
Bozik have been referred to the
Sports Information Office. Could
it be that Bozik is ducking the
press? Naw.

Pitt has tried to downplay the
situation, claiming that the
university is not responsible
because the check was in Mike
Nuzzo’s name and not the
university’s. That is the worst
possible thing that Pitt could do
because there is no denying the
fact that someone on the athletic-

depaxtment payroll broke the ,

law.

Thus the responsibility to take
action fell squarely on the
shoulders of S the university in
general and Bozik in particular.
The fact that something was not
done a lot sooner than yesterday
will make for a lot of red faces in
the offices at Pitt Stadium.

concrete has evolved yet in the
game that he loves so much.

“If I could come back, it would
have to be [in] the right
environment —— one where you
could allow the soil to be worked
so that the seeds could come out
and not be choked out by the
thorns and thistles,” Thrift said.

How about the Pirates?

“I think that as the organization
exists today, it would be a foolish
question,” said Thrift. “I really
think that they should be sold to
a group of three or four or
whatever.”

Thrift built the Pirates from a
perennial loser to a pennant

and said that if he got another

“I think it would depend on the ,

condition of the team now —
what kind of players they have
[and] what kind of players they
have with the farm system,” said
Thrift. “But I think that we proved
here in Pittsburgh that it could be
done in a short period of time.

“Most people said ﬁve Yhars;
we did it in three. But you've got

to become a contender before
you can win it all. And I believe
that if I’d stayed here, we could
have been a championship team
this year. They still might be one
without me. Who knows? I think
they have the best talent in the
National League East.”

In the next decade, baseball
will come to realize that using
the latest technology can improve

the players, according to Thrift.
Nutrition and conditioning will
also become part of a player's
everyday routine, the same as
batting practice and stretching
out. But Thrift gave a warning of
what could also happen:

“Baseball must watch out [for
itself]. You can’t destroy yourself.
Don’t bid against yourself. No
one will win that way.”

TI-IE PIT!’ NEWS, Wednesday, April 18, 1990

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The Big East baseball season
has reached its midpoint, and the
Pitt Panthers are still looking for
some degree of consistency.

The season began with a 2—4
series of games played in Florida.
The team seemed to be ahead in
certain areas, such as hitting, and
a little behind in others, namely
defense. For the next 10 games,
everything went downhill, and
the team slumped to a 3~12 record,
marked by a 1-9 stretch.

Now the team members seem
to have . found themselves, as
evidenced by their vicctories in
three of their last four contests.

Pitt has beaten Boston College
once and Georgetown twice for
its ﬁrs‘ Big East wins in the last
two seasons.

“We started to put it together
because we’re doing all the little

» things you need to do to win

games," said Pitt Coach Bob
Lewis.

“When you fall behind like we
have done this season, the
strategy is taken from the game,”
added Lewis. “The bunting is
gone, [along with] the stealing of

la base to move a runner up. The

things I enjoy doing to win a ball
game are gone. This team needs
games to be 3~2 or 2-0 games.
Close games. That is what we
have been doing, and we're
winning."

To see why this Panther team A

loses, look to the error column.
In its 13 losses, Pitt committed 45

-errors for a 3.4-per-game average.

In the Panthers’ six wins, they
have had only 12 errors, averaging
two per game.

“Inconsistency has been a big '

disappointment for me," said
Lewis. “We’ll be going along in
la] game and suddenly start
throwing the ball around,
committing key errors that have
knocked us out of games.

“That's what happened to
Georgetown when we beat them.
They had an inning where, for
no apparent reason, their defense
disappeared. If we keep‘ our
defensive mistakes to a minimum,
then we could win some games. ”

In the early part of the Big East
season, the Panthers played Seton
Hall and Providence, two of the
better teams in the conference.

“I wish we could have played
these teams later in the season,”
said Lewis. “I don't know whether
that would have made a
difference [in the win column],
but it definitely would have
helped our freshmen to come
[into the program more easily] if
they didn't have to face the really
good competition first."

The team has shown promise
in its hitting — which has lately
proved to be disappointing.

“We have been better
offensively lately because we
ﬁnally bunched some hits. Against
Georgetown, we were able to
get live or six runs in an inning to
really help our confidence,” said
Lewis. “In the earlier part of the
season, we left too many men on
base. We'd get people in scoring

I.

position — only to strike out.
“We have to take advantage of
all the opportunities we get.” ,
A hitting surprise during the
Big East season has been
outfielder Greg Trimbur. In the
last seven games, he has hit .421,

including two doubles and three

RBIs.

“Trimbur’s hitting has been a
pleasant surprise,” said Lewis.
“We knew he was a solid
defensive player, but the hitting
has been a surprise.”

Trimbur has committed only
one error in the 13 games this
season.

The pitching has been as erratic
as the rest of the team. The team
ERA in Big East games is 6.24.

“One time out a pitcher will
show good stuff and get another
opportunity which he won’t take
advantage of,” said Lewis.

“I'd have to say the pitching
has been both a surprise and a
disappointment. Just like all the

- Panther baseball team looking
for consistency at mid-season

other parts of the team, we have
to go out every time and play a
solid game [in fundamentalsl.”

As far as the freshmen go,
shortstop Ralph McNelly seems
to have stepped forward.

“McNelly has handled the
pressure fairly well. T he more
time he plays, the better he will
play,” said Lewis.

Panther Notes

Pitcher Ralph Cecere might be
ready to go by this weekend. He
stretched ligaments in his left
elbow in a game against Boston
College two weeks ago.

Outfielder Curvin Richards has
left the team to work on his
studies. “Richards left the team to
work on his finals,” said Lewis.
When asked if Richards would
return after ﬁnals, Lewis said,
“That's up to Curvin and football. ”

The next home game for the

Panthers is this Saturday at noon

against the Villanova Wildcats.

Van Pelt reportedly bombarded
Hackett with phone calls pleading
for him to express his desire for '
the job, but Hackett remained
seemingly uncaring. Pitt
administrators knew where to find
him.

“I ‘wasn't sure what the
university was saying,” Hackett
said. “I wasn't sure what the
university was trying to do. Plus,
I was really caught up in getting
the team ready for the bowl game.

“It was just a time where there
was a lot of stuff going on, and I
just couldn’t worry about anything
other than the game against Texas

Hackett would go on to garner
major doses of respect from his
players once the team ﬂew to
Texas in preparation for the game.

enforced until the eve of the
contest, so the players could enjoy
the night life of El Paso. “You
have to have fun in this" game,”
Hackett said, when explaining

his lenient strategy. .

On Friday, Dec. 29, one day
before the John Hancock Bowl,
Hackett and Pitt President Wesley
Posvar met and had serious
discussions for the first time about
the job. Two hours later, Posvar
offered Hackett the position -
permanently.

Posvar announced Hackett’s
hiring to the jubilant Pitt players
on national television right before
the bowl game, and the Panthers
went on to a 31-28 win over the
Aggies.

After 13 years of an agonizing
wait, Paul Hackett finally had
cleared the hurdle. He was a
head coach.

It is now a spring afternoon in
1990, and Hackett is well into his
regime. At approximately 12:20,
Hackett ﬁnishes a meeting with
his staff, who walk out of his
office clothed in sweats, blue
jeans and coaching shirts.

At 12:30, a sharp-dressed
Hackett opens his office door.
He has a gray suit on, in sharp
contrast to his casually attired

assistants. When you are The
Man, you must dress like The
Man. .

Hackett is asked to ponder
some problems that he must face
in the near future, not the least of
which is a mission to throw water

on the fire that Gottfried created” '

with the academic community.
He has already met with Pitt
College of Arts and Sciences Dean
Mary Briscoe and College of
General Studies Deanjohn Bolvin
and apparently has an attitude to
their satisfaction.

Hackett also stirred controversy
when he dismissed several
assistant coaches from last year,
including popular defensive-line
coach Frank D’Alonzo. The firing
of D’Alonzo caused star defensive
end Keith Hamilton to seriously
consider transferring and had
other members of the line
mumbling. It is not known how
much of a factor D’Alonzo’s
dismissal had on defensive tackle
Mark Spind1er’s decision to turn
pro, but nevertheless, Hackett
has to face the facts that a sure-
fire Al1—American in 1990 has hit
the road. .

Hackett remains committed to
Fred vonAppen, who he hired

' away from Stanford in February

to become defensive coordinator
and defensive-line coach. “When
there’s a change, the only thing
I’m concerned about is the
chemistry of the team,” he said.
“I’m someone who’s going to
make the decisions here. No one
player is more important than the
team.”

The fact that Hackett must deal
with these things means he must
do what he said he despised in
the mid—’80s —— being an
administrator. Will Hackett enjoy
his new role, or will he soon
yearn for the days when all he
had to worry about as a football
coach was football?

“This job is so immense and all-
encompassing that you have to
accomplish a certain amount in
different areas.

“There's that lure to run the
whole operation,” he continued.
“That's what makes everyone go. ”

There is also the simple
question whether Paul Hackett

V can make it as a head coach. He

has been successful everywhere
he has gone, but then again, he
was not working with the
Columbia University JV squad.
No matter how well Hackett
and Briscoe or Bolvin get along,
Hackett will always be ultimately
judged by how many games he
wins. Even Hackett admits that
he may not be occupying his
office now if Gottfried had gone
for it on fourth down against
Penn State and Pitt would have
scored a touchdown. Who is to
say how many of the

academicians would have been i’ I

stifled by a win over the Nittany
Lions and an 8-2-1 record?

As Sipe put it, “I don’t envy
Hackett if you can get your ass.
fired for going 7-5-1.”

But no matter what happens,

Hackett will always have those

clippings on his office wall.

Clippings which signify the end h

of years of frustration.
For Paul Hackett, life starts at
42.
