Shafer Speaks

°Students Here To Learn, Not To Teach’

Lameduck Governor Raymond
Shafer, hailing the merits of the
state of Pennsylvania and defend-
ing the “escape valve” of the de-
mocratic process, faced a packed
SU Ballroom Wednesday after-
noon. The Republican leader has
been touring as many colleges
and universities as possible in the
past year on a mission of “idea
exchange with theyoung people
of the Commonwealth.”

Armed with statistics, Gover-

nor Shafer claimed that Pennsyl-
vania holds the highest record in

Intercultural House

Applications for the Intercul-
tural House are still being ac-
cepted through November 10. The
basic idea behind the House is to
bring together separate Ameri-
can cultures to live in mutual re-
spect and concern. The program
will provide accomodations for
20 male students, and the composi-
tion of the House will be roughly

one-half black and one-half
white.
According to John Tyler,

spokesman for the project, few
applications have been turned in.
Application forms may be obtain-
ed at 261 Social Science Build-
ing, 572 CL, and the Informa-
tion Desk in the.Cathedral. For
the coming term, the member-
ship will be limited to second
term sophomores and first or sec-
ond term" juniors.

The building for the program
has been chosen, and is located
at 272 N. Dithridge.

A search is also on for a pos-
sible faculty or staff member to
live at the House as a regular
member. This would provide an
opportunity for the participa-
ting students to get to know a
faculty member on a personal
basis, in addition to adding a dif-
ferent perspective in the inter-
change of ideas.

the nation for employment. 1967
saw a record high. said the speak-
er; 1968 broke the record and 1969
has evidenced an increase in un-
employment by the month.

Along with progress in air pol-
lution control and drilling rights,
this state, said its Governor,
“blessed with more colleges than
any other,” appropriates a larger

sum for prigvate institutions of high-

er education than any other state,
including California.

“But completely free education
for all would bankrupt Pennsyl-
vania at this point," he interjec-
ted. “Moreover, the costs per stu-
dent here are the same as in Cal-
ifornia.” He implied that free ed-

ucation is not indefensible since
California has the highest drop-
out rate in the country.

He rejected suggestion that reg-
ulation by a federal agency
could alleviate the financial
problems of higher education.
Since he doesn‘t believe in “pal-
lid uniformity from on high.“ Gov-
ernor Shafer has attempted to
speed up the legislature in pass-
ing on finance bills. He has pro-
posed a time‘limit based on the
fiscalyear.

The “enlightened governor’s”
defense of the democratic pro-
cesses provoked fire from the
floor. Much of the debate revolv-

er around the representation and

Lmiglmee Requirement

Debate Rages On

by KATHY KUNOLD
Staff Writer

The battle over the necessity
of a University language require-
ment still rages on. The Under-
graduate Council after a two-
hour student-faculty discussion
Wednesday morning motioned to
postpone voting on the matter un-
til next Wednesday at 10:00 a.m.
so that those who would like to
present further opinions at that
time may do so.

If the council should vote to
abolish the requirement next
Wednesday it will go before a
special meeting of the Arts and
Sciences faculty for final appro-
val.

Professor Pfeffer. chairman of
the German Department. pre-
sented the language department's
proposal and Jeff Geffin of the Un-
dergraduate Council, delivered
the. student counter-proposal at
Wednesday’s meeting.

The language department posi-
tion this year can be interpret--

ed as an attempt to increase the

strength of the present require-
ment with an added emphasis on

culture. Professor Pfeffer prefac.

of Trustees.

Although an honorary mem-
ber of the Board. here and at sev-
eral other Pennsylvania schools.
the Governor is not actively in-
volved because he does not “want
toe in on the policy-making of
private_institutions.“

Responding to a question.
Governor Shafer answered that
students “have a right to know

the minutes of the Trustee meet-
ings": he believed. however. that
blanket open meetings would
hamper the conduction of the
“basic business of the Univer-
sity."

“Decisions made en masse are
not fruitful,” he evaluated. “You
choose your representatives and
they make the decisions in your
behalf.”

“Giving the responsibility for
decisions to a small group is un-
democratic." challenged history
teaching fellow Josh Chasan. “And
we do not have a choice in who
shall be our trustees."

Students come here to learn,
not to teach, believed Shafer. Trus-
tees are chosen by a system that
has “historically evolved.”

"This evolution has taken the
decision-making out of the hands
of the people and given it to the
few.” countered student Mike Fab-
ricant. “The University has a re-
sponsibility to the community.

Community people should be sit-
ting on the Board."

The Governor agreed with his
point but not with his perspective.
“The University will change." he-
predicted.

When asked to comment on the
Nixon address as "Ray Shafer.”
the speaker strongly endorsed
the President's position. “The
President is evidencing the most
sincere effort to bring the war to
a successful finish." commented
the Governor.. "He is doing what he
believes is right for us all to
make a permanent peace.“

As for Spiro Agnew: “I agree
with the Vice—President‘s point
that a nation cannot develop
its foreign policy by demonstra-
ting in the streets. But I'm not
talking about his language.“

On the Moratorium: “This is a
generation that is interested in
peace. They have a right to voice
their opinion. But this is not the
way to bring about Peace. We
should not do anything that
might bring aid and comfort to
the enemy.”

In summary. Governor Raymond

_P. Shafer pledged his support to

“democracy” and the right of the
minority to voice their opinion
to their Congressmen (especially

through letter writing). “Democracy

is only an escape valve.” he closed
"We must cherish it. We need it
in our changing society.”

Governor Seeks Communication

by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN
Staff Writer

"1 just want you _to know how
pleased and happy I am to be
here," Governor Raymond P. Shaf-
er told representatives of the
Pitt News, University Times and
WPGH. “One of the things that
has been troubling me for a
long time has been . . . the idea
that between generations we’re
not communicating. I want to

» eliminate that'idea.”- In the con-

versation that followed. it appear-
ed that Shafer’s main prob-
lem is the immobility of the state
legislature and his inability to
budge it. I

it proper thought and have not
gone into it deeply enough . . .

Q. What is Pennsylvania’s fore-
most problem?

Pete’s °Gol(l(in)’ Triangle

by GEORGE LIES
Contributing Editor

(This thing is about Pittsburgh's
mayoral overture, only it doesn't
begin that way so’ stayed tuned
please.)

I was going to sit down Monday
night and write wh_v John Tabor
should be mayor BUT why I would
vote for Pete Flaherty.

That line may be confusing. but
at 10 p.m. Monday. President
Nixon had me really confused. I
didn't understand why he would

take a 30 minute commercial to.

explain that Vietnam was a war.
that we had more than a battalion
of combat troops on a tour of duty
there. and that I was his "fellow
American."

I WAS TRULY upset when Eric
Sevareid couldn't find the words
to "analyze and describe" what
the President actually said.

And. that's why this statement
comes to you. more or less. due to
video delay.

. The race in Pittsburgh is
over. we all know that. but what

' has happened is interesting.

John Tabor (the Lloyd Nolan of

Pittsburgh) should be mayor of

Pittsburgh because. even though
he's a politician on the one hand.
he stood where you could see him.
He said most of the problems in
Pittsburgh could be solved. and he
gave specific solutions to them.
Sure. maybe you didn't like what
he said. But you at least knew
why you didn't.

Tabor had a great campaign
manager; Tabor never missed an
appointment. was always on time
. . . and. of course. he shook hands
at the mills. '

THE BAD THING about "The
Doer" is that he's the type of may-
or that "does" on Monday after a
riot Sunday night. that "does" on
Tuesday after a ‘demonstration
Monday morning. and that "does"
on Friday after a strike Thursday
afternoon. '

I didn't mention Wednesday.

a but that's when he "does" open

press conferences to tell you what
happened at last week's open
press conference.

NOW, IT IS very apparent that
Pete Flaherty is not the door. He
can't really say what's on his
mind today because he’s already
thinking about tomorrow. Of
course. he shouldn't answer to

Mayor Barr's headaches and
that's why he didn't say too much.
this time around.

He made no promises and no

power plays. and not many TV ap-
pearances. Like the gray-haired
eagle of City Hall said: "Pete's
smart. People don't change."

Once a Democrat. always a
Democrat is what he meant. And.
in Pittsburgh with its ethnic-ori-
ented neighborhoods. that is es-
pecially true.

Tabor would've guided with a '

strong hand. worrying about yes- ’

and he
“If you don't

terday's problems:
would've told you:
like it. . . leave."

FLAHERTY, on the other hand.
will need at least one and one—half
, years to turn-off the machine. an-

other half-year to remind. f'olks
that now. he has the power. . . and.
finally. two years ‘in which to
change the policies of Pittsburgh
for the folks. by the folks. and of
the folks.

Asking that of Flaherty is ask-
ing a great deal. asking that of Ta-
bor is ridiculous. and asking that
of Nixon is pathetic.

The Credibility Cap In Being

Violently Opposed To.Nonvi0lenee

by JERRY GRUEBEL
Associate editor

There were about eight of us sit-

. «ting on the floor in somesort of a

circle. Things were getting rather
dull. no—one had much to say.
When the "silence is golden" per-

iod extended past five or so min-,

utes, Bill. the host. knew what to
do. ’ ‘

Bill asked the kind of question

" most middle class college stu-

dents know how to talk about. Di-

across the room. Bill asked_. »"Do
you believe in non-violence?"

"Yes." she said.

“Do you believe in free will?"
asked Bill. , ~

"Yes." she said;\

Bill looked disturbed. "You're
nuts," hedeclared‘. "You're talk-
ing suicide.“ -

Priscilla asked why. She could-
n't understand how Bill could dis-
approve. To, say. "I'm non-vio-
lent." To say. “Yeah. I believe in
free will." To say. "I'm me."
That's the "in thing" nowadays.
That's what makes you popular.
That's what makes you beautiful."

Bill didn't "buy Priscilla's
words. "What would you do." he
asked. "if you saw a pig beating
on your boyfriend's head?" Would

you try to stop him?"

“I don_‘t know. I guess . . 

"You guess?" grumbled Bill.
“You'd let that pig crack your boy-
friend's skull? You'd watch your
boyfriend's head bleed? You'd
watch him die? You wouldn't try
to stop the pig?" '

Priscilla was agitated. "I guess
Iwould. but . .

could you say you're non-violent

Priscilla was squirming on the-

“You're not.“ replied Bill.
“Look. don’t feel bad. There's

Priscilla, banging her hand

have to wear a coat and tie. I

asked her what was the matter

it wasn’t good enough for the

told her that she was a smart

see it expressed in such intem~

than shocking. I find it diffi-

On the other hand, I am al-

the implication contained in your
headline for the letter which shows
a relating of such attitudes to all

in its own way, is a possibly les-

titude towards us older folks?

I was distressed. to see on the
first page of the November 3
edition of the Pitt News pictures
of five young female candidates
for Homecoming Queen. I ser-
iously question the academn-
tellectual, and social validity of
contests such as this. Isn’t the
Homecoming Queen_ competition
simply a way of selecting the
prettiest among pretty girls and
doesn’t this re-enforce the gravely
mistaken cultural pattern of de-
fining American women primar-
ily in terms of physical rather
than intellectual attributes?
This type of contest is detrimen-,
tal to the education of both young’
women and men because it gives.
a prize to thebest object not to
the best‘ person. ' .

I hope in the future the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh will recon-
sider its policy about beauty
contests.

Next week is homecoming. Next A
week a new homecoming queen
will reign. Her election will have

many of the candidates around
campus. ‘I can honestly say that
their pictures. posted in the Cathe-
dral and in the Towers lobby.
don‘t do them one bit of justice.
Either a professional photographer
should have been employed to
take "realistic" pictures. or the
girls should be voted on by a pan-
el of judges. rather than by a few
thousand students who happen to
look at very "unrealistic“ pic-
tures. Congratulations. Miss

Premiere Werln(*s(lz1y

Ballet Company Formed

A new dimension has been

added to the Pittsburgh cul-
tural scene with the formation
of the Pittsburgh Ballet Thea-
tre and its premiere‘perfor-
mances Wednesday and Thurs-
day, November 12 and 13 at
the Pittsburgh Playhouse Craft

. Avenue Theater at 8:30 p.m.

The new ballet company has
been formed under the direc-
tion of Nicolas Petrov and in
affiliation with Point Park
College. Leonide Massine,
internationally known choreo-
grapher, is artistic _adviser
and Donna Davidson is the
producer. ‘

The ballet company of 35 has
local dancers Joan Hillyer and
John Occhipinti, seen last year in
the Playhouse production of Nut-
cracker, as its principal dancers.

The premier performances will
feature three guest artists. Ethel
Winter, modern dancer and Sears-
Roebuck Affiliate Artist at Point
Park College, and Barbara San-
donato and Alexei Yudenich, prin-
cipals with the Pennsylvania
Ballet Company, and husband and
wife in private life.

The program will include a new ’

ballet, Suivees, choreographed by
Nicholas Petrov, the traditional
Les Sylphides with Miss Hillyer
and Mr. Occhipinti, Le Corsair
with Miss Sandonato and Mr.
Yudenich, and two solo perfor-

mances by Miss Winter — Spiritual V

Passage and En Dolor.

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
has been formed to meet the need

for a performing dance company.

in the city. Dancers under Mr.
Petrov’s direction have performed
ballets for the Playhouse Produc-
tions, Pittsburgh Opera produc-
tions, the Three Rivers Arts Fes-

tival, and have appeared on WQED.

Through the formation of a com-
pany we hope to give permanence
and form to dance in this city.

Liberace, along with his com-
pany of fifty and his full orches-
tra, is coming to Syria Mosque
for one week only, beginning
Monday evening, November 10.
Liberace will present seven con-
secutive evening performances
at 8:30 and a Saturday matinee,
November 15, at 2:30. '

. The candelabra, the sequins
and the flashy costumes, the musi-
cal talent, and the sense of hu-
mor will accompany Liberace,
who has been named “Mr.
Showmanship.”

Mr. Petrov said in explaining
the purpose of the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre. “The establish-
ment of a resident ballet com-
pany within the city will greatly
enhance the capabilities of per-
forming groups which now exist
and will enrich the general cul-
tural offerings of the city.”

For the past twenty five years
Liberace has proven his talent
and vast audience by sell-out
performances. He has earned an
aura of a “Liberace Legend.”

Tickets for all performances
are on sale at the three Down-
town Department stores and at the
Pitt Student Union. Students can
purchase two $5.95 tickets for the
price of one for Tuesday, Wed-
nesday, and Thursday night con-
certs only.

Language Requiremellt

Proposals Presented   I

(Continued from Page 2)

required to take two terms of lan-
guage at the University. They
may chose to fulfill this either
through courses in advanced con-
versation. relevant foreign litera-
ture in that language or English,
an introduction to civlization
relating to that language in that
language or English. or readings
in that language onscience. so-
cial science or the humanities.

Students who enter with less
than three years of language in
high school would be required
to enroll at the appropriate level
in regular or laboratory language
classes and when they are success-
fully completed enroll in two terms
of the above listed courses. Those
enrolling in a new language in
college would be exempted from
taking additional sequences.

' This means that no student en-
tering the University from high
school would be exempt from
taking some sort of language
course. Previously some students
with four years of language in
high school were exempted from
-the University's language require-

- ment.

The student counter-proposal
centered on the question of
whether or not it was the respon-
sibility of the University to tell
students what courses are bene-
ficial or whether it is the depart-
ment-’s responsibility to make the
courses attractive to the student.

It also questioned whether the
present requirement puts more
emphasis on quantity rather than
quality. Mr. Gepplen brought
out the fact that to him the
language departments’ proposal
is a complete contradiction of
their last year’s proposal in that
it doesn‘t seem to be as fully
committed to "intrinsic language
learning." The fact that there is
no uniformity in three year pro-
grams at different high schools
was also brought out.

Mike Kociubus questioned the
effect the new language depart-
ment proposal would have on
students coming from underprivile-
ged areas where there was not a
conducive atmosphere for lan-
guage study. He expressed the fear
that these students would be
penalized and they they can’t af-
ford additional penalties.

T true learning experience. He felt_

   
 

He also commented that only ‘II
when the student realizes that his 7
courses are relevant is there a

it is time the language depart- ;_ .
ments quit hiding the guise of ,7
a requirement and set up cur- 
riculum students find attractive; I

Dr. Anthony, chairman of the, "
Linguistics Department, pro-jj'_
posed that the language require-,
ment for the B.A. degree be done I :
away with and that students be 
able to chose to study language only 1
if he finds it useful in his major, 
he also suggested making more 
languages available for study.‘

A member of the Spanish De- 
partment questioned if there was ‘ “
any correlation between An— _
thony’s view and the possibility of , 
building up the exotic languages
program being developed in his‘.
department. - _ V

She was also the only one to; 
discuss the matter in economic-‘ r
terms stating “let’s be honest;
we're worried about our jobs.” '

. Dr. Pfeffer said that he resent- .  
ed this statement "as he wasn’t 
worried about losing his job. 
She replied that Dr. Pfeffer was at B ‘ff’
full professor and she was"only»' * 9

an assistant professor.

The Physics Department repre-
sentative to the Council stated
that 15 years ago a knowledge of T V A‘
French and German were im— .
portant in his field but today a’ "
European Science conferences .
papers were being presented in .
English and that a course he had ‘A
given at the University of Munich
he had gone prepared to give it
in German and was asked by the
students to speak in English. A

The question was also brought
up as to at just what age students _
are qualified to decide what cour-, '_ _:i a.
ses are best for them. It was ‘the; ‘
opinion of the, students present . 
that this time came when you be‘-1
gin to pay for your education. -

 

As one girl put, “when you are
paying for a service you have a"
right to decide; when you go to
a restaurant and order steak they I I‘
don’t make you eat eggs.” If.
the language departments have. 
anything to say, it will be eggs  I‘
for a long time to come.

I The debate about student re-
sponsibility, extending the Uni-
versity into, the community and

‘ bringing the community into the
University were the themes un-
’ .derlining the trend for curriculum .
;changes over the past few months.

.Distributed Changes
Significant revisions .have ta-

ken place in‘ the College ‘of the j

Arts and- Sciences (CAS) since

.1 " March. These _'changes apply to
7 « all students enrolled in the Col-
 lege. The Distribution of Studies

has been changed from fifteen to
nine creditslrequired in each of

 ,th'e~ three areas of learning: hu-
 .;manities, natural sciences and so-
;cial sciences. Credits must be
, taken from a minimum of three
’  departments in each area.

An interdisciplinary course may

Vibe sustituted, as under the past

regulation, for a departmental

' I course in meeting this requirement.

 Students may elect any course
1 ;for which they have met the sta-
 _ ted departmental prerequisite.

The first course in a second or

Y’ . ‘third language will count toward
'..—Dist_ribution of

Studies. Lan-
guage level two must be taken in

;order for the credits for level
:< one to count toward graduation.
' Only the first course in a second
“or third language will count to-
‘ward’ satisfying the Distribution

of studies requirement.
The pass/fail option for jun-

   
 
 

.. iors and seniors has_been chang-
. ‘ed to a Satisfactory/Unsatisfao
 tory option for all students. S re-
 presents A,B,C, grades and counts

as credits toward graduation,'but
will not be used in computing the

"QPA". U represents D and F

and carries neither credits nor

f quality points. ‘ v
f’ . Students may elect one S/U
course of their own choosing each
term (a maximum ,of eight) in
 _;any; area including that ‘of- the

fmajor unless specifically prohi-
bited by the major department.

I _An -S/U will be indicated on a

, fspecial card included with in-
voices. The card should be given
“tot theinstructor of the course sel-
 e.cted'by the time final examina-
{tions begin. ‘ I

 rriculu

A required language, may be
taken S/U in addition to the eight
optional courses.

If the student wishes to take

' exercise‘ the S/ U option for both the

required language and another

‘course in the same term, he

should-apply at the College office
for a second S/U card.

Several ways of satisfying the
language level four have been
approved One alternative has the
same foreign language content as
the current language four course. '

-Another alternative, also listed
as language four, stresses culture
and is presented primarily through
the foreign language.

If the student has already taken
one.of the courses designated as
an alternative by his language de-
partment, the requirement is con-
sidered met. a

A course taken as an alternative
to language level four also satis-
fies part of the ‘Distribution of
Studies requirement.

No More Phys Ed
Instead of 124 credits necessary
for graduation, CAS students

will be graduated with 120 credits
provided all requirements are met.
CAS students are no longer re-
quired to take physical educa-
tion. If the student wishes, he
may .take up to four one-credit
physical education courses to ap-
ply toward his degree of 120
credits. '

“I” Grades
Most of these revisions went
through the UC prior to the Fall

Term of 1969. Since the Council
has moved on other evaulative

procedures. It recently extended

to undergraduates the opportun-
ity to take “I” Grades in cour-
ses in which the problems they
are investigating are too com-
plex 'to be handled in one term
of s_tudy.

The “I” grade, previously
available only to graduate stu-
dents, can be awarded for any
course, but only at the request of
the student and with the con-
sent of the instructor. “I” grades
will not be counted in computing
quality point averages and no
credit will be allowed for cour-
ses for which an “I” grade has
been given until the “I” is re-
placed by a quality grade.

For undergraduates, course work
should normally be completed and
the “I” grade removed by the end
of the next term during which the
student is fully enrolled.

The UC decided that no penalty
shall be awarded to unremoved
“I” grades and that no limit_ be;
set to the number of “I” grades
any student may elect.‘

Removal of “I grades must be
authorized by the instructor and
approved by the Dean. '

Already “adopted in principle"

-by UC earlierin the term\ is a.

proposal to establish credit .for
“out-of-classroom” learning. Un-
dergraduate students engaged in

research and study outside con-.

ventional classroom work could
qualify for University credit un-
der the proposal. "

Eligibility for credit would be

‘determined by a faculty me-m-

bers approval of a’ student’s plan-

ned out—of-class study program.*

faculty sponsorship ‘and .extra’--.-

The ASRC

The curriculum innovations of
the recent past are but an indi-
cation of things to come. Many
of them have been initiated by
the College of the Arts and Sci-
ences Review Committee (ASRC ),
.a committee formed last spring
by the UC.

The six faculty members of the
ASRC include: David Brarnhall
(Chairman) and David Houston,
Economics; Barrett Mandel, Eng-
lish; William Loerke, Fine Arts;
Orlando Taylor, Psychology and
John Townsend, Physics.

The three students membersare:
‘Mike Fabricant (UC- Chairman)‘;
‘Everett Banisterri

A story has a beginning. a mid-
die. and an end. It would be hard
to say exactly when the Universi-
ty's political story began. but a
good place to start is September.
1969.

In September. students saw the
beginning of the Committee of
Concerned Students and Faculty.
The committee observed a "grave
deficiency" in the University
structure and a lack of decision-
making power on the part of the
students. It was the first group to
strongly verbalize discontent

. with the make—up and administra-

tion of the University.

By October. all students had the
opportunity to voice their opinions
on the University. but only 80 re-
sponded. It was the Speak Your
Peace. open to the community for
questioning several administra-
tors. Students began then the line
of questioning still open today in
the University. There were dis-
cussions on student participation.
the trustees. the University and
the community. and the roles play-

members. Some days later. a few
members of ROTC discovered the
inscription of obscene words re-
lating to President Nixon micros-
copically printed within the art-
work of the cover of the issue. The
entire issue was brought before
the Student Publications Board.
and the words in question were
found non-libelous. But the free
speech issue was not dead.

In a few months, another type
of freedom came into question.
Black students sat in at the com-
puter center until Chancellor Pos-
var would comply “positively”
with the “better action for blacks”
demands of the group. That night,
Posvar and the Black Action So-
ciety came to an agreement that
the University would act more
quickly on black studies, black
student recruitment, and increas-
ed black faculty and staff.

Soon‘ after that January dem-
onstration. State Senator Fleming
proposed a bill in response to the
black sit-in. the ROTC demonstra-
tions. and the free speech conflict.

A UNIVERSITY student and private citizen march together
for the Moratorium,

ed by students. faculty, and ad-
ministration. The Pitt News re-
ported then that “the major com-
plaint of the studentswas that ev-
eryone hopes. but no one does any-
thing. When are we going. to get
some action? How long do we have
to wait?‘

Through the fall term of -1968,
controversies over secret re-
search, ROTC, and free speech
continued. to come to the fore-
ground. On the issue of secret re-
search, the Faculty Senate passed
a group of additional proposals to
the University policy on calling for
the discontinuation of all classi-
fied projects except under highly
unusual circumstances. The pro-
posals included statements re-1
quiring that the research be re-
Iated to the .‘‘educational mission”
of the University or‘ of ‘ T‘signifi-
cant social value” and that the
purpose of the research not be to
“devise or improve means to de-
stroy human life.” In addition, the

objectives ‘of the research, and ,

the source of support" “must be
known and should be disclosed to
the faculty in cases’ where there
is doubt whether they are justi-
fiedunder University Policies.”

The ROTC issue was also"
brought out into the open in Octo-
ber. After many demonstrations.
rallies. confrontations.’ and de-
bates. the issue finally came be-
fore the Faculty of Arts and Sci-

ences for a vote onwhether ROTC»

would remain accredited in‘ the
College. Dec.‘3 the College voted
106 to. 84 to abolish academic cred-
it of the program. Controversy
over the votecarried on into-the
following term.

The issue of ‘free speech arose
twice during the 1968-69 year’. The

first time. it was over a student;

publication. Alternatives. Editors

of Alternatives claimed that their .

all-ROTC‘ .issue ,(pred,om'ina'tely-
agaxinst ROTC) was stolen by"a
few of'the membersof the Persh-

ing ARif.les.i a.-fraternity -ogf R0.TC- -

r

Fleming’s plan. which was to be
applied to all state-operated and
state-related universities. is that
when a student would enroll, he
would be given a list of rules and

would be told that if he refuses to

follow them, he would not be al-
lowed to matriculate. If after en-

rolling. he would willfully violate '

anyof the rules. he would be sub-
ject to punishment. including sus-
pension or expulsion. One of the
rules stipulated that a student
could not act or speak in a "lewd
or lascivious manner."

While all these "activities"
were going on. Student Govern-
ment was passing a student bill of
rights and statement in support
of the Black Action Society. The
-next and present .administra_tion.
after a floor fight. passeda reso-
lution against the Fleming bill.

All of these issues were sudden-,

ly brought into the open with the

‘first teach-in in the Cathedral’

Commons Room last February. A
group of about 800 students gath-

ered to discuss several demands '

on University" policies.

The de-
mands were: A

-Th'at all censorship. direct or in
direct. end and that University
printing facilities be made
available to all recognized Uni-
versity publications. I

—That the December decision of

the faculty concerning removal

' of "credit for ROTC be upheld.

and that no modifications of this

decision be‘ made without the
consent of the faculty.

-—That the administration take a
public stand against the propos-
al of Senator Fleming and any
similar legislation which would
result in the supression of basic
rights: specifically freedom of
speech and right to assembly;
that Fleming, as a trustee of the
University, -abandon any plan

' for introducing legislative bills ’

designed to limit the freedom of

the; members of the University-.

.<3piI1fmu_I_Iity..

Politics

—That the University unequivoca-
bly and publicly expose and op-
pose the presence of student in-
formers on campus.

-—That the dean of students office
cease the practice of keeping se-
cret and unauthorized files on
nearly all undergraduate wom-
en.

—That the faculty and teaching
fellows be allowed to freely dis-
card the grading system at their
discretion.

After this teach—in. there oc-
cured a series of discussions and
teach—ins open to the University
community. The same issues were
discussed. but nothing was re-
solved to anyone‘s satisfaction.
Dissatisfaction. disappointment.
and disgust climaxed March 11
when a meeting of 100 students in
the Commons Room swelled into
a marathon teach—in of more than
900 in the Common Facilities
(CF) building. The meeting broke
up when an injunction was served
at 4:30 a.m. against the remaining
300 participants.

The teach—in was touched off by
the refusal of Thomas Rea. chair-
man of the University Board of
Trustees, to hold an open meet-
ing with the students and faculty
to discuss grievances and propose
a change in the selection of board
members.

The initial group of 100 left
the Commons Room and headed
for CF with plans to fast for three
days and occupy the building. Their
wish was to break up into smaller
groups after the CF closed at 10
p.m. to conduct discussion groups
on such issues as the roleand
functions of the University, cur-
riculum, and non-violence.

The “free university" recon-

vened the next evening in the So- . 

cial Sciences building. after re-
ceiving a permit to stay their dur-
ing the next two days of the three-
day fast and teach—in. After the
teach-in ended. the Concerned Stu-
dents and Faculty issued‘ a state-
ment. showing their concern for
three general matters: "the cur-

riculum of the University. the

making of decisions in the Univer-
sity. and the relationship between

the University and the commun-

itv.“

The day the statement was is-
sued. 110 students and faculty of
the University's School-of Phar-
macy marched to the Cathedral
vowing support for_the adminis-
tration and protesting the Free
University. The Free University.
however. continued to hold ses-

sions (with less publicity) until

the close of the term.

‘The summer term was one of
transition. when a turn towards
politics on: a higher. level than the
University began. Rallies sponsor-
ed by-the then-existing University

I SDS (non an independent group.

the Revolutionary Socialist Un-
ion) condemned American socie-
ty and called for students to move
for improvement. Students and

faculty involved themselves in the ‘

grape boycott. the May 24 March
for-Peace and Justice. and a dem-
onstration against the Duquesne
Club downtown for its members‘

financial investments in compa- .‘

nies which manufacture 1 imple-
ments for the war in Vietnam.

When the fall term. started this I

year, one of the first political con‘-.

. flicts students became involved

was the Black Coalition March,
downtown. The March was form-
ed to protest the closed construc-

.tion unions in‘ the city of Pitts-

burgh. A petition with over 200
student .and faculty signatures
was addressed to the Chancellor
urging him to suspend all con-
struction at the University over
which he had no control, and tore-
quest the Commonwealth to take
similar action- with its construc-
tionat the Uni_versity. , ~.  A ax —

STUDENTS PARTICIPATING in the trusteesit-in discuss open board meetings
with administrators.

The Chancellor issued a state-
ment claiming that the "Universi-
ty would support any satisfactory
agreement reached in the current
negotiations, and that if such an
agreement is not reached. the Uni-
versity shall defer initiation of
any construction under its control
and shall request that the General
State Authority not initiate proj-
ects on behalf of the University
until we feel that satisfactory pro-
gress has been made in correcting
unjust employment practices."

Another political issue students
embroiled themselves in this term
is. the war in Vietnam. Oct. 15 was
the Moratorium. and the Univer-
sity took an officpialstand. encour-
aging classes to be cancelled. All
that day on campus were rallies.’

concluding with a march to Point

mittee on’ campus is now organ-
ized and selling tickets and giving
information for the March on

The only political conflict cam -

cerning the University itself this
term was again over the issue of
the open trustee meeting. Con-
cerned students held a sit-in for
an open trustee meeting on the 36th
floor of the Cathedral before fin-
ally being able to set up an all-
University meeting to discuss the
possibility of an open board meet-
ing. Although the meeting con-
cerned the board, a major ques-
tion on the students’ mind was the
relationship of the board and the

community. Students were not
satisfied with the answers they
received from the trustees rep-
resenting the board and walked
out of the meeting.‘ '

The three major issues on cam-
pus now are still

p? _duct‘of that effort, which outlines current Uni-

ity_ rules in a number of criticalareas affect-
-ingfstudents.
Alcoholic Beverages

erages on campus.

)j.' Dormitory residents may keep alcoholic
beverages in their rooms, if they have registered
h;-the University Housing Office, Towers Lob-

Such registration requires presentation of a

DRUGS

The University of Pittsburgh prohibits the
>Illegal.possession, use, or distribution of mari-
ana, LSD, or other hallucinogens and narcotic
’fdr.'ugs-

ny student known to be distributing such drugs
will be dismissed from the University. The Uni-
versity will not differentiate between violations
occurring on and off the campus. -

The, University considers problems associated
'th;the use of drugs to be personal, medical, or
p "chological and will approach them in that light.
All medical and psychological resources of the Uni-
ersity will be made available to a student need-
'n°g assistance with a personal problem of drug ad-
diction or habituation. When all resources of the
University fail, or when the student refuses such
sistance, suspension or dismissal from the Uni-
versity mayresult.

‘. CIVIL PROSECUTIONS

It" is generally improper and unnecessary'for a
u versity to duplicate the law enforcement func-
_ons of the Civil State. However, when a student’s
behavior makes him liable to the civil authorities
‘-and" at the same time offends the standards of
student life, University sanctions may be im-

 

at, Only those /students over 21 years of age will

tion that the same right which justifies their pro-
test also justifies the presentation of views by those
whom they oppose.

However, assemblies and demonstrations need
not and must not be at the expense _of or cause
physical abuse to persons and property. They
must not interfere with the full use of ingress
to, and egress from any portion of University prem-
ises or with the regular functioning of the Uni-
versity. ~- ~
SELF-REGULATORY CURFEW SYSTEM
Eligibility

Any woman who has been enrolled for the
equivalent of two-15 week terms as a full time. stu-
dent, or is 21 years of age, is eligible for the Self-
Regulatory Curfew System.

All eligible women who are under 21 years of
age ‘must have parental permission to participate in

. this program.

Procedure

Sign out books will be available for those wo-
men who expect to be out beyond the maximum
curfew hour. Anyone leaving the ‘residence halls
and expecting not to be back before the maximum
curfew hour must sign her full name and the time
she leaves. Upon returning to the residence ‘hall,
she will be required to sign her name on the same
line. She need not indica te. herrtime of return.

Any woman who leaves the residence halls
expecting to return before the maximum curfew.
and experiences a change in plans must phone -the
residence hall desk by the maximum curfew and__in-
dicate that she will not return by the maximum cur-
few. When she does return, she will be expected
to sign her name indicating that she has returned.

No Unescorted Men will be permitted in the
women’s dormitories above the first floor. Unescort-
ed ‘women will bepermitted in the house lobbies of
the men’s dormitories only during an open house.
At no times will unescorted women be allowed in ‘

Activities

In there spare time, students
find many and varied activities
at the University today.

Students may participate in
clubs, organizations or groups ran-
ging in nature from Student
Government, with a senate. exe-
cutive board and numerous com-
mittees to the girls intramural
swim team.

There are still fraternities,

judicial boards and the commuter
association. There is now SDS
and concerned students and faculty
groups to vie for the student’s
time. There is a curriculum re-
view committee, even a commit-
tee to study the, possibility of de-
emphasizing football. There is now
a Black Action Society.

All toll, there are hundreds of
activities to lure the student from
his studies, his free moments, even
his weekendsat home.

F imtl Season Brightest for “Napper”

iﬂi

PAUL “NAPPER” NAPONICK
Three Games to Go

PN qPho to’s by Donaldson

 

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Paul Naponick is a sen-
ior. Like his senior team-
mates, he’s no stranger to
losing.

As a sophomore and junior.
he saw his team humiliated —
big scores and two consecutive
1-9 seasons. This year the Pan-
thers haven’t made the national
rankings and they haven’t even
reached the .500 mark, yet. But
the number of wins has been
tripled and the losses have been
closer.

"Several times ehwn we were
1-9. I got discouraged and things
never seemed to go right. Every-
body got down on themselves and
lost confidence." explained the
towering defensive end.

“We’ve won more games this
year than ever since. I’ve been
here, and we’ve also been in
more games,” he continued. “And
a lot of the big scores this year
aren’t indicative of the way we’ve
played.”

“Napper“ has been a three year
regular at defensive end, as he
moved into a starting role as a
sophomore. Recalling his first two
seasons with the varsity, be de-
scribes his performances as “spot-
ty.” “I think I’m playing more
consistently now. Experience has
helped. I have more confidence

Playing a 4-3 pro type defense
this season, Paul has the chance
to take advantage of his size
and play more like a tackle,
covering the inside rather than
outside. “I’m playing against
guys moremy size, not against
the quick, speedy backs.” v

In the beginning of the sea-
son, the Panthers faced quick,
speedy teams and he got his

-weight down to about 230. But
now with the meat on the schedule
on tap, he’s back up to 245.
“Napper” has never been known
for his quickness, but rather as

0st Grati

 

 

\. - ms

NAPONICK moves in for

an agressive, bruising hitter and
the har hitting teams are the type
he likes to go up against.

“Those type of teams come right
at you,” Paul explains. “Who-
ever hits the best is the team that’
wins.”

Against the big, strong Syracuse
Orangemen, the Panthers hit the
best, and for Paul, that win over
Syracuse has been his most grati-
fying experience since coming ‘to

Skyscraper U. “That was one of the -

best games I played and it’s one
of the best that everybody played.
It was a good team effort. Every-
body did the job.

And with only three games re-
maining in his college career,
“Napper” is hungry for more
wins. He’s confident and he’s ready.
“We’re going to knock a few peo-'
ple off yet this season,” he predicts,
“If we play as well as I know
we can.” '

“For the last two years, the
season was at a dismal point
around this time. Our opponent
would get a couple _of quick
scores and we’d be down. But
last week shows we don’t feel
that way anymore. Syracuse got a
quick score on us, but we came back
to win. We have our self confi-
dence back, and _we can do the
job.”

 

» I» 1-, s ‘. 

a tackle against West Virginia's E die Wil-

in myself andin my teammates_n$a tuna’: Napper has been a three year regular at defensive end for the
an ers.

As a high school star, Naponick
was an all-state performer in foot-
ball and basketball. He had his
choice of schools. His older bro-
ther “Big John” was on scholar-
ship at the University of Virginia,
and Paul explains that the big
choice for him was between join-
ing his brother at Virginia or com-
ing to the Steel City.

“Pitt is the perfect school.-
There’s a medium between get-
ting a good education and play-
ing good football. Most schools

are either good academically or

else they're just a football fac-
tory. Here I’m getting both.”

A psychology major, Paul wants
to enter law school after gradu-
ation, but he would also like a
shot at professional football once
he leaves the college ranks. “I’ll
see how it goes. If I get a de-
cent shot, I’d like to play pro ball.”

But Paul won’t be thinking
about pro ball tomorrow after-
noon. He won’t be thinking about
law school either. It’s Notre
Dame tomorrow. It’s Notre Dame
and the grim memory of a running
clock and the embarrassing scores
of the past. It's Notre Dame to-
morrow and the spirited antici-
pation of an upset.

For Paul Naponick, all is not
over yet.

"Charles "7710? ”

By Martha H (trtle

Sports Editor

Walk up to just about anyone on campus and ask them
if they’ve seen Charles Gottfried. Chances are you’ll re-
ceive a strange stare and an automatic “Charles Who?”

Chuck_Gottfried is the Panther offensive line coach.
He seems to get less “ink” in the newspapers than the
other Jungle Cat assistants. And he likes it that way.

“Don’t say anything about me,” he says. “I don’t care
who the coach is. He can’t do anything if the the buys don’t
want to play — and win. The guys have got to have it in
their hearts. Then the coaching comes in.” 4

Actually, Gottfried hasn’t been around the Panthers
squad as ‘long as the other aids. Carl DePasqua didn't have
an offensive line coach during the spring game last April.
He selected Gottfried in August, just prior to the Panthers
fall camp. ' ~ I - » '

For the average Jungle_Cat follower here’s a hint on
identifying him at the gridders’ practice sessions.

If you see someone screeming loudly atsome of the
big plays wearing numbers in the 60’s, 70’s, or 80’s,
that’s probably Charles “Who?” He certainly doesn’t
back away from the musclemen. He might scare the
timid, but he definitely gets through to the tackles and
guards. -

The Panther running game has improved tremendous-
ly this year. Sure, Tony Esposito and Denny Ferris are
good athletes and have been able to stay healthy. But
even 0. J. Simpson found out that you can’t run very far
without the openings when you get to the line of scrim-
mage.' .

Gottfried’s tutoring has also kept Jim Friedl nearly
spotless. The quarterback hasn’t been caughtbehind -the
line too often on pass plays, thanks to strong protection
from the front force.

“The guys have done a great job—-so far,” Got_tfried
noted.. ‘,‘,They’ve improved more than any other line I’ve
coached. ‘

. “They started out a little slow. Then the last three‘
weeks they looked fine. But we do have a lot of improv-
ing to make in the next three games.

“They know what Notre Dame’s gonna be like
Saturday because most of them have played against them.”
They’ll have to be better than they were against Syra-
cuse.

One of the facets that needs improvement is the block-
ing for Joe Spicko’s punting. Spicko takes a little longer
than coaches like when he releases the ball. And he takes
an extra step or two. ‘ '

DePasqua uses Spicko, though, because he is “a
kicking specialist. It's O.K. to put somebody in there who
takes one step, but where does theball go?” '

Spicko'would“ have a great punting average without
the blocked and partially-blocked kicks. With them his av-
erage is still more than adequate. '

“We’ve worked rnoreon the punting than I everhave,”
Gottfried mentioned. “But it’s just one..of those things.”

The ex-Illinois guard continues to hound the line on
blocking for Spicko. And he hasn’t forgotten about the block-
ing for-running and pass plays, either. If you don’t believe
me, go up to practice and watch . uh, hear him.

by EVAN PATTAK

When Notre Dame Coach
Ara Parseghian assembled his
troops last spring, he was
probably amazed at the num-
ber of strange faces in the pro-
spective offensive unit. Gradua-
tion, the Grim Reaper of the grid-
iron, had claimed all but two
members of Parseghian’s power-
ful offense.

The Hanratty gang had de-
parted, leaving Parseghian with
defense intact but with little
hope of moving the ball. The
sixth-year coach must have been
wrenched from sleep with night-
mares of scoreless ties. “Our
most exciting plays this year,”
moaned the Mustang moonlighter,
“may be broken plays.”

Never one to rest on his repu-
tation, Parseghian set to work.
With the savvy of a field marshal,
the luck of a Leprechaun, and
the beaming favor of Pat O’
Brien, the Irish mentor develop-
ed. an offense that of late, has
run amuck.

Co-architect of the offensive
renaissence is quarterback Joe
Theisman. The “Road Runner,”
as he is known around South Bend,
has amassed 1,324 total yards,
. many of which were gained
scrambling and dancing out of the
pocket. Theisman’s passing abil-
ity was one of the major spring
question marks, but_the slender
junior has dispelled every doubt
about his arm, completingi57 per
cent of his passes and nine touch-
downs. ’

Quarterback Theismann 

  Leads RejuVe11atedND 

The Irish .running game. picked
over and tossed aside by gradua-
tion. received another early set-
back with the loss of fullback
Jeff Zimmerman for the season.
But the less-heralded Irish backs .

Harriers Seek

by JERRY MYERS

After a long year of waiting,
the Cross country team will
have a chance to seek revenge
from Penn State. The PSU
long distancemen best the
Panthers handily in ’68, 20-39.

With a much younger squad.
Penn State is going to be tough
to beat. Coached by Harry Gro-
ves, the Nittany Lions started
the season with a 24 man squad.
only 7 of whom are juniors and
seniors leaving 17 men in the
freshman and sophomore cate-
gories. Included in these seven-
teen is a freshman team which
finished second in the IC4A
frosh classic.

Coach Jim Banner has been
keeping his runners in top shape
over the two week layoff they’ve
had between meets. The double
workouts have helped and the boys
feel confident that they can pull
this one out. Each of the start-
ing.« runners has been informed as
to who will be running against

him and consequently, who he

has to beat.

The boy that the distancemen
must watch most carefully is a
guy by the name of Greg Fred-
ericks. Fredericks, a former PIAA
two-mile chapion, won the
IC4A’s last year and ran a

Cubs Beat Public
Teams Go for IM Title

by MIKE MILLER

The Law cubs trampled Public Health 21-0, Wednes-
day giving them a shot at the ATFL title in the independent

_ intramural football division.

The Cubs received the open-
ing kickoff, but were unable to
move the ball and handed it oer
on the fourth down.

The cub defense held Public
Health and receovered the Pig-
skin after four plays.

Bill Hudson gained yardage on
a run play and then passed to
Chuck Hergenroeder. After sprint-
ing for another gain, Hudson hit
Hergenroeder in the endzone for
six points. A conversion pass to
Herg enroeder put the score at
7-0.

Public Health was again un-
able to advance and punted.

Cub’s Bill Hudson lobbed a
pass to L. J. Dreeland, who
handed off to Bill Dickie for a
slight gain. The Cubs, however.
gave the ball on the fourth down.

The defense recaptured the ball
for the Cubs but failed to ad-
vance and lost it again.

Public Health had no better
luck and, after four incomplete

Hudson moved the ball on a__run
play. After two imcomplete pas-
ses, he hit Henry Horvat for a
gain and then fired a TD pass
to Hergenroeder. Horvat snag-
ged the conversion pass to in-
crease the lead by another seven
points.

Public Health gained yardage
on the next three plays but lost
on a bad snap and punted.

After advancing the ball with-a
series of passes Hudson galloped
for a TD Horvat grabbed an-
other conversion pass to make the
final score 21-0.

Penn State boasted a tough 6-2
record in 1968 beating West-
Virginia (22-37), Temple (15-50),
Navy (15-48), Quantice (15-50),
Syracuse (15-48), and Pitt (20-39).
The squad finished sixth in the
IC4A and fourteenth in the NCAA
Championship. The only teams
that could contain starters were
Villanova (handily, 19-36) and
Georgetown in a squeaker 27-29.
The boys from University Park
pose a monumental threat the
distancemen’s cherished unde-
feated record. Unlike last season
though, the Panthers are well
rested and fully manned to meet
State and will be running on
Saturday.

The course itself sizes up to be
a five-mile trek through the Uni-
versity Golf Course. Interspersed

with hills, trees and heavily
wooded areas it looms as more of
an obstacle than a cross country
course. The record time for the
stretch is 25:03.2 set by Tom
Donnelly of Villanova in 1968.
Compared to the race that Jerry
Richey ran against PSU, in
Pittsburgh last year (21:05),
the course is going to present a
much greater challenge.

Penn State goes on to battle
Juniata next week before enter-
ing the IC4A championships in
New York, on November 17.
Coach Groves, in his second sea-
son as head coach at Penn State

he compiled an impressive 270-

Coach Leo Bemis, however——like any coach, refuses to dis-
count his opponents until the final outcome is not longer a point

of conjecture. Bemis remarked
that C-MU has the ability to score
in addition to maintaining a fiery
team spirit.

“I think that we’ll find the game
with Carnegie-Mellon tougher
than the Slippery Rock contest.
This will be their big game. I ex-
pect the match to be like some of
the Pitt-C-MU basketball games.
'l‘hey’ll carry the battle to you;
they’ve got some pretty good soc-

cer players,” Bemis commented. '

Another reason that Bemis be-
lieves that tomorrow’s rivals (in
Comparison to Slippery Rock)
should be a sturdier obstacle to
crack is because of the vacuum of
soccer tradition between the two
Pittsburgh schools. He ex_plain-
ed that Slippery Rock actually did-
n’t expect to win. (Slippery
Rock’s overall record against the
booters is l-13-2.) C-MU, on the

. other hand, has never opposed the

varsity booters.

Before last season C-MU did
not possess an intercollegiate soc-
cer squad. In C-MU’s initial year
of varsity soccer competition,
however, they whipped Bemis’

hopes, on the fact that several
players from last year’s frosh
squad are not starting for the var-
sity, and if they downed them be-
fore they can down ’em again.

Chucho Valencia, one of the
1968 freshman, cautioned that
C-MU has a winning team this
season (5-3-1) and remarked that
the rival coach has scouted. many
gbooter games. Chucho said, “At

..,Soeeermen Face CMU Tomorrow;
Expect Continued Scoring Splurge

by BILL NAAB

The_re’s a general feeling among the soccer squad that a
massacre will occur 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. The‘ p1ace—the Car-
negie-Mellon University football field. The victim—-the C-MU

booters whitewashed the Grovers,
3-0. Other C-MU opponents were
of relatively minor caliber.

If the booters do total 10 or
_more goals Saturday, then it is

do if we just play like we’ve been
playing?” .

Lineman John White reasoned
that if the booters continue bar-
reling along as they have been, C-
MU may be rapped out of the stad-
ium. “I want to really lay it on C-
MU. I hope we cream them. If we
try very hard at all, we can easily
score better than 10 goals,” White
snapped.

White might appear cocky in
stating such remarks. However,
in reviewing common opponents,
White’s statements are some-
what understandable. C-MU lost
to Slippery Rock, 1-0; the booters
slaughtered the Rockets, 8-2.
C-MU lost to Grove City, 3-1; the . 5 ,
