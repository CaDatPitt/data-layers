Earthquakes Recorded On
University Seismograph

The University seismograph, which
is located in the basement of the
Cathedral, noticed the occurrence of
two earthquakes, on November 12 and
16. Upon» the'obtaining of data from
other stations, the department will be
able to check its accuracy with the
actual earthquakes that took place on
these dates.

The University seismograph, in
charge of H. M, Rutherford, is the
only one in the city, and the nearest
other ones are located in Cleveland
and Washington.

Tech Council Votes Apology
For Sign Painted On Drive

Football enthusiasm which prompt-
ed a few Carnegie Tech students to
do some fancy sign painting on the
University campus on the eve of la.st
Saturday’s game today had resulted
in an apology and a resumption of
postal relations by the Tech student
council. In a letter yesterday to Stu-
dent Council, the Tech governing
body, through its president, Josef L.
Lentz, Jr., submitted an apology and
offered to pay for all damages.

The text of Lentz’ letter addressed
t.o the University Student Council
and signed by himself, _is as follows:

“The Carnegie Tech Student

Council has voted an apology to
the Pitt Student Council for the
signs painted on the buildings
and campus of the University of
Pittsburgh. The Carnegie Tech
council has also agreed to pay
for the damage done to the Pitt
campus, as per our agreement,
without any discussion whatso-
ever.”

Lentz, commenting further on the
incident for the News, said: “It is
extremely unfortunate that such a
violation of our agreement has hap-
pened. VVe can assure the Pitt stu-
dent body that adequate measures
w;i1l be taken with the perpetrators
of the violation. whom we believe to
be members of the freshman class.
so that there will be no recurrence of
such actions in the future."

Rain has already obliterated most
of the paint applied by the Tech
revelers. Some paint still remains on
the University drive with “Skin the

M. Rutherford To Operate
Seismograph In Cathedral

 

We’ve heard about a lot of odd jobs,
but the oddest yet belongs to the man
who earns his daily bread by manu-
facturing artiﬁcial earthquakes. Mor-
gan Rutherford, new graduate assist-

ant in the department of geology,
doesn't make earthquakes to help fail-
ing merchants collect their earthquake
insurance, but he does make them to
help metallurgists locate rich mineral
deposits in the oil ﬁelds of Oklahoma.
His method is to explode several
sticks of dynamite, and, detecting re-
flex wave action in the ground by
means of» a seismograph, -he deter-
mines the composition of the ground.

Mr. Rutherford came to Pitt chieﬂy
to operate the seismograph in the sub-
basement of the Cathedral. He is a.
graduate of Tulsa University where
he majored in mathematics and phy-

sics and was working for his graduate
degree at the University of Texas be-
fore he received his appointment to
this school. In addition, he has spent
seven years in research work in the
ﬁeld of commercialseismology, and
he is the youngest expert in his line
of work.

Incidentally, a seismograph is a ma-
chine that detects earthquakes by
means of a sensitized wave detector.
The machine at this school was in-
stalled two years ago by the Govern-
ment bureau at Washington and is
one of the most completely equipped
in the country. .  M

Since its installation, .however, it
has been operated on a part time
schedule by the math and science de-
partments, but Mr. Rutherford will
run the seismograph on a full time
schedule.

Thanksgiving Holiday

According to John G. Quick,
registrar of the University, the
Thanksgiving recess is sched-
uled from 4 o’clock this after-
noon to Saturday, inclusive. The
offices of the University will be
closed on Thanksgiving Day
but will be open as usual on
Friday and Saturday.

Coeds Given
Commissions

Capacity Assembly Hears
New Victory March

 

Ten coeds were given commissions
as honorary captains of the ROTC
last Friday in the Soldiers’ and Sail-
ors’ Memorial Hall. at the testimonial
assembly to Dr. John B. Sutherland,
coach of the varsity football team.
The commissions were presented on
the stage by Franklin Kallfelz, Eng.
’33.

Reed P. Rose, Dent. ’33, president
of Student Council, was in charge of
the assembly and presented the speak-
ers. Dr. H. E. Friesell, dean of the
Dental School, Charles Wettach of the
University Athletic Council, Lester M.
Taylor, ’12, Dr. Sutherland, and Cap-
tain Paul Reider of the football team
addressed the capacity crowd.

The band gave the ﬁrst rendition of
the new victory march written for the
University by Mr, Taylor and George
M. Kirke, ’13, co-authors of “Hail to
Pitt.”

Colonel E. J. Cullen appointed the
following coed captains: June Miller,
Bus. Ad. ’33, sponsor, regimental
headquarters; Thelma Yetter, Col, ’33,
sponsor, ﬁrst battalion; Dorothy Lee,
Col. ’33, sponsor, battery A; Char-
lotte Walker, Col. ’33, sponsor, bat.-
tery B; Gladys Pyle, Col. ’33, sponsor,
battery C; Jean Stotler, Col. ’33, spon-
sor, second battalion; .Barbara Ann
Hartmann, Col. ’33, sponsor," battery
D; Sara Dunmire, Ed. ’33, sponsor,
battery E; Rose Marie Demestichas,
Ed. ’33, sponsor, battery F; and Cath-
erine Cronister, Bus. Ad. ’33, sponsor
of the band.

Health Excuse
Decline Noted

Health Exercise, Applica-
tions Number 22

 

The new system of excuses inaug-
urated by the women’s student health
service has diminished the number of
applications for excuses by more than
nine-tenths, according to Dr. Auleene
M. Jamison, medical advisor to wo-
men, In comparison with the number
of excuses issued this October with
those of the same month last year,
ﬁgures show that in 1931, 240 individu-
als applied for excuses from class as
compared with only twenty-two ap-
plications this year.

Dr. Jamison says, “Many professors
feel that the new system permits stu-
dents to feign illness to a greater ex-
tent -than they» have before. In 4-. my
opinion this is not true. The student
is now responsible to her professor
for her presence in class, which makes
for a closer relationship between stu-
dent and professor, a highly desirable
condition.”

In regard to additional medical
service offered by the University, Dr.
Jamison adds that in 1931, there were
only sixteen follow-up examinations
for October, as against seventy-four
for this year. Dr. Jamison believes
that the great increase may be due to
ﬁnancial conditions. Students either
feel that they are not ill enough to
consult a physician, or they cannot
afford the added expense. Dr. Jami-
son has held 438 consultations with
328 individuals during the past month,

The women’s rest room, an innova-
tion this year, has proved a help to
many tired or ill students. During
the month of October alone, 132 stu-
dents made use of this service.

Dr. Coffman Gives Ninth

Dr. A. W. Coffman, technological
specialist of the Mellon Institute of

engineering in the Fellows room Mon-
day morning at 8:30 o’clock. “Cor-
rosion-Resistant Materials” will be
this subject.

Three Frats
Violate Rules
Of Initiation
Ten Men  d Without

B i d d 1 e’s Certiﬁcation
After Rushing Ends

Reprimaiidf Offenders

Two men’s social fraternities were
publicly censured. and one was put
on probation until February 1 by In-
terfraternity Council as the result of
illegal initiation of ten men following
the close of the -fall rushing period
last month, it was announced today
by Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men.

Phi Delta Theta and Theta Chi
were advised of their offenses and
were severely reprimanded for the
illegal action, Phi Gamma Delta was
placed on probation until February 1
and a representative of that frater-
nity is being required to report to Mr,
Biddle weekly.

The infractions of rules consisted
in the initiation without certiﬁcation
of ﬁve men by Phi Gamma Delta, one
of whom was ineligible; two by Phi
Delta Theta, and three by Theta Chi.
The violations concerned the rules
whicl1 specify that “a student’s eligi-
bility for initiation shall be certiﬁed,
in each instance, by the oﬂlce of the
dean of me11," and that “no pledge
shall be eligible for initiation until
he has completed’, in the semester
preceding initiation, twelve
with eight quality _points.”

“The offenses of the three fraterni-
ties this year were probably mere
oversights,” said Mr. Biddle. Inter-
fraternity Council, however, stated
that, “ignorance of the law is no ex-
cuse and they shall be made to pay
whatever penalty has been inﬂicted."

Plaiféﬁflenti  
Agency Here

Organization for Periodical
Sales May Give Jobs

What promises to be a most out-
standing departure from precedent
will probably materialize within the
next three weeks with the organiza-
tion of a Student News and Periodical
agency as a new campus activity.
According to Chester B. Bennett, head
of the employment bureau, the agency
will be the ﬁrst activity at Pitt formed
expressly for the purpose of making
money for the students engaged in it.
While it will not be oﬁicially recog-
nized as a school project, it is expect-
ed to be heartily endorsed and en-
coura.ged by the faculty.

It is expected that the Student
News and Periodical agency will pro-
vide a proﬁtable source of income to
the students who engage in it. lThe
agency ‘will have indirect contact
with practically every publishing com-
pany in existence and will handle
highly technical and scientiﬁc maga-
zines and periodicals from several
foreign countries in addition to the
more common magazines.

The magazine agency was adopted
after the plans for an insurance agen-

cy failed to materialize, Its organi-
zation will be constructed along plans
similar to-"an agency at Princeton.
The young man who is appointed stu-
dent manager will choose his own
staff, and will have complete charge
over it. He will distribute all sup-
plies, he will assign sections of the
school for his staff to canvass, and he
will receive copies of sales from his
staff to mail to the central agency.
In other words, he will act as go be-
tween for the students and the com-
panies. The entire proposition is on
a commission basis.

For the past"week Mr. Bennett has
been considering applicants for the
position of student manager, and it is
expected that he will announce his
choice within a few days.

Warner To Attempt Here
 To Redeem Poor Season

By Bob Wade
Sports Editor, Stanford U. Daily

PALO ALTO, Nov. 21.—Pop ‘Warner will attempt Saturday to
‘redeem a poor season by a victory over Pitt ’s highly touted eleven
in the game at the Pitt Stadium. A victory over the team coached
"by his former pupil, Jock Sutherland, would help this year ’s Stan-

ford record immensely. -
Warner is leading to Pittsburgh a Stanford eleven which has
-shown greatipower between the 20-yard lines, but not much in the

way of a scoring punch. 6

have gained more yards in each game
than the teams they have met this

year, they have come out on the short
-end of the score three times out of
10 games played.

This lack of drive of the “Big Red”
team when near the ﬁnal stripe may
be laid to several factors. The
tackles are not up to the caliber of
the rest of the team, the line is very

gotten the oft-repeated warnings of “fussy” high school teachers,
with the result that college English, as observed by Dr. George Car-

has become a hybrid between “Points of Style” and a football yell.

Despite the strain that two meets
in ﬁve days brings, the Pitt cross

The freshman cross country team
made the day a success by defeating

R. H. Johnson Addresses
Unitarian Church Sunday

Roswell H. Johnson, head of the oil

address the congregation of the North

ing, at 11 o'clock. The subject of
Professor Johnson's speech will be.
“Ethics in a Scientiﬁc Manner.”

Dr. Wycoff, a representative of the
Gulf ‘Company, who has recently re-
turned from Texas, spoke to the ap-
praisal classes during the
hours on Tuesday and Thursday, on

not been able to rise up to inspired
heights as yet this year, except per-
haps, in the California game, when
they held the powerful Bears to a 0-0
tie.

Warner said at-the beginning of
the season that he was looking for no
miracles from his eleven, but, never-
theless, he attributes Stanford’s weak
record thus far to bad breaks as
much as to bad playing or to failure
of the boys to master the intricate
"Warner system.

The Indians are unusually light
this year, and this has been a severe
handicap. One of the first principles
of the Warner system is that the line
must hold until the backs, in the
complicated reverses, are through.
The Stanford line has not been con-
sistently able to hold.

Pop has had some tough luck this
year in injuries, also. At various
times some of the best men in the
Stanford lineup have been unavaila-
ble. However, it seems likely that
the team should be in good shape for
the Pitt game.

Heretofore, Warner has had great
success in bringing his Stanford team
East. Stanford has played Penn once
and Dartmouth once in the East and,
both times, the Cardinals gave a
smashing exhibition of complicated,
but precise, football to overwhelm
their opponents.

If the ﬁeld is dry Saturday, the
Cardinals may be able to unleash a
sweeping attack which will knock
Pitt from its underpinnings. But
Pitt will be the favorites. Their rec-
ord is certainly far more impressive
than Stanford’s.

Weinstock barely took it over on the
fourth down. '

Less than 12,000 shivering fans
braved the snow and rain to watch
the two teams battle. The greater
portion of the game turned into a
punting and fumbling duel, with the

Panthers having the edge in both de-I

partments.

Carnegie surprised by starting their
so-called “sl1ock troops,” but they
were hurriedly replaced by the regu-
lar line. Carnegie’s only real tlireat
for touchdown came in the ﬁrst quar-
ter, when they recovered a Pitt fum-
ble on the Pantlier’s eleven-yard line.

An Eye for an Eye

HE vicious rule of “justice by retaliation” again has threatened

to shatter peaceful relations between the students of Pitt and
Carnegie Tech.

Just three weeks since an invasion of the Tech campus by cele-
brating Pitt students caused the Carnegie Tech Student Council to
request a reafﬁrmation of responsibilities between the two institu-
tions, the Tartan governing body has been placed in the embarrass-
ing position of the transgrcssor. This time it was the Tech children
who “ran oﬁ the reservation” to have some fun.

Unlike our own miscreants of October 31, however, they came at
night with a program that did not include such frank collegiate ex-
pression as cheers and songs. In short, they painted; but not too
well. Timely weather conditions and the quick work of the build-
ings and grounds department combined to remove all but faint traces
of the institute ’s “art.”

Both councils have displayed commendable judgment in dealing
with violations of their joint “responsibility” agreement. President
Lentz, of Carnegie Tech, insists that he will deal promptly with the
freshmen whom he believes responsible for Friday night’s affair.
President Rose, rightfully tired of the clamor aroused over this and
previous demonstrations, dismisses it as a “sophomoric” action.

Both councils should feel the injustice and insult of being iden-
tiﬁed with offensive minorities who overstep that sad principle which
guarantees an eye for an eye.

Retaliation must go; and it can only be replaced by responsibil-
ity, recognized and borne by the individual.

Why Not Now?

TUDENT COUNCIL’S recommendation for a storm barrier on the

ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral was received favorably by the

University several weeks ago, and it was stated at the time that
some action would be taken in compliance with the request.

Cold weather since has swept down on the city. .There is a
promise of real Winter in the gusts of cold air that play through the
lower ﬁve ﬂoors of the unﬁnished building. And yet the conditions
which demand the daily class attendance of more than 2,500 stu-
dents in the building remain the same. .

Particularly for those students whose duties in activities keep
them in the Cathedral until long after the last class has been dis-
missed, until the last light has been turned out in recognition of the
end of an eighteen-hour working day, the Work in constructing the
promised storm barrier might be hurried. Elevator facilities, at
present as adequate as circumstances allow, yet force many between
and after-class students to spend long minutes of waiting in the cold
of the ground floor corridor.

The barrier, promised for the near future, might easily be com-
pleted within the forthcoming holiday session, with less confusion
and more timely beneﬁt for all concerned.

An organization known as the Na-I
tional Economy League is ﬁghting
hard to get on page one these days;
and credit is due the League's pub-
licity men, for page one plus head-
lines is often their position.

In view of the fact that this Nation-
al Economy League is attracting con-
siderable attention and favorable
comment, it might be pertinent to in-
quire of the purposes and program of

the organization. Like any other
“non-partisan” body, its aims are eso-

...ByW

teric. But its origins, particularly its
psychological origins, are evident
enough.

At the present time, with unbal-
anced government budgets as common
as athelete’s foot, the catch-all catch
word of the hour is “economy.”
Tconomy is a safer slogan than the
Forgotten Man. And, I suspect, just
about as meaningless. '

Reduce Government Cost

The National Economy League, we
are assured, plans to reduce the costs
of government. That soun-ds plausi-
ble enough. In the light of the pop-
ular belief that governments, particu-
larly the federal government, have
been throwing the taxpayer’s money
right and left the past few years.
it sounds downright commendable. But
that the federal government has been
wasteful is a premise of doubtful
validity. The federal government,
since the VVor1d War, has been sad-
dled with a tremendous debt. In the
years 1919 to 1928 the national public
debt was reduced some $700,000,000
annually; and that huge pay-off natu-
rally called for high taxes.

The cost of the federal government
is high because the cost of war is
high. There are, of course, loop
holes in the budget through which ex-
travagance and useless expenditure
can creep. But to assumee at the
mere cry of “economy” that we can
start slicing taxes right and left is a
grave error. We have assumed the
expenses of past and future wars, and
we must continue to bear those ex-
penses. There are other departments
whose expenditures could be out. But
they are the very departments which
-are performing the real and beneﬁcial
service of government.

Those departments which carry on
the public works, research, and edu-
cation programs are apparently the
ones at which this so-called econ-
omy is aimed. And illogically enough,
they absorb a small portion of the tax
receipts, usually less than ten per
cent.
‘What of Disabled Vets?

As for the suggestion that the gov-
ernment cut off its aid to disabled war
veterans Whose illnesses are not the
direct result of war injuries, that seems
to me a. cowardly proposal. First, a
disabled man must be cared for by
someone. And the federal govern-
ment seems as capable and as duty
bound to 1901: out for the welfare of
these men «as anybody. And second,
to prove in a court of law the real
source of, say something as obscure in
origin as a lung disease, would be a
difficult matter. Such cases could
result in little more than bothersome
litigation.

Economy in government are no
hollow words. But anyone anxious to
run down public extravagance will ﬁnd

good huntng grounds in local, rather
than national, budgets.

The burden of local taxes have
fallen heavily, for they are levied al-
most always on real estate; and the
owner of real estate is more often
than not a small-income man. He
pays even if his property is mort-
gaged, just as much as does the debt
free and well to do. There is no con-
sideration of how able he is to pay.
And in recent years the tax rates o-n
DI‘0De1‘ty haVe risen, taking away
what little glamour there remained in
the unromantic business of owning a
home. ‘

Farmers in Revolt

The farmer likewise has suffered.
Not only has the bottom dropped out
of the market for his goods, but the
taxes on farm property have risen 158
per cent in the thirteen years from
1914 to 1927. It is no wonder that
farmers in the West are now plan-
ning “tax strikes.”

The advocates of economy brag that

they are going after local extrava-
gance as well. But local taxes go, in
the main, to the support of schools,
which most of us until now were de-
luded into believing in as worthy ob-
jects of public support. Maybe we
Were WI'0I1g in giViI1g so much for edu-
cation.
-‘Local taxes are too high. There is
no denying that. But if there are to
be cuts, they must be in the right
places. And if there -are to be less
extravagant governments, they must
be the product of the determination
of the people. The corrupt municipal
governments that exist everywhere in
the United States are nothing more
than the product of the voter’s lazi-
ness and stupidity, A non—partisan
organization might combat corruption
and waste effectively; but I would put
more trust in honest and able political
parties.

The controversy over disarmament
which threatened last week to wax
powerful among the faculty and then
subsided, has been renewed. Two
professors approached on the subject
lately have supported Dr. Francis D.
Tyson in limitation of armaments.
None believed, with Prof. Russell J.
Ferguson and Prof. Evan T. Sage,
that the United States should build up
its war forces.

Dr. Ben H. Williams, professor of
political science and ﬁrst lieutenant
in the 69th Field Artillery during the
war, advocates a proportionate reduc-
tion in all armaments throughout the
world, This stand, he points out, is
a very practical one, and far from
idealistic.

“We should disarm,” says Prof.
Williams, “for three reasons. Build-
ing up a. large navy provides a great
irritant toward war. Next, in 1932 we
must consider economy, and, last, the
United States will beneﬁt defensively
if all nations disarm. Small forces of

Review Points
To Prosperity

Research Bureau Figures
Indicate Better Times

Cheer up! Good times are coming.
Take the old tux: out of the mothballs
and put some gas in the lizzy for bet-
ter -d'ays loom ahead. At least,
so the Pittsburgh Business Review,
the monthly summary of business put
out by the bureau of business re-
search at the University, indicates.

The Review states, “Marked im-
provement occurred in general busi-

ness activity during September, thei

ﬁrst time since early in 1931.that
business expansion was signiﬁcantly
larger than a seasonal -change.”

In Pittsburgh, we ﬁnd that business
picked up very noticeably in Septem-
ber, although Pittsburgh has a pre-
dominance of the slower-expanding
industries, such as steel and steel
products. Steel showed distinct im-
provement.

Employment in the district
creased 4.6 per cent and payrolls in-

creased 2.4 per cent during Septem-
ber and early October. Sales of elec-
tric power expanded 8.2 per cent,
freight car loading increased‘ almost
5 per cent; and almost all the retail
houses reported considerable in-
crease. In addition, recent reports
on ﬁnancial conditions in the district
show a welcome improvement, while
commercial failures reached their
lowest level for the year.

Of -course, many problems, such as
the weak condition of our foreign
trade, the unsettled political condi-
tions of the world, the small payrolls
together with the large amount of
unemployment, and the heavy load of
national and private debts still re-
main to be overcome before rapid re-
covery can be assured. But recovery
from any depression is not a rapid
change, depending as it does on the
overcoming of fright and fear. Despite
this, the Review feels that we are at
last on the road to prosperity and
that we can hope that, in the not-
too-distant future, “happy days will
be here again.”

potential enemies will be ineffective
indeed if directed against our shores,
three thousand miles away.”

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, head of the
political‘ ‘science department, .. sees . no
reduction in national expenditures
without a proportionate reduction in

arms. “War debts,” says Dr. Grap-
er, “will never be paid us without
ruining our trade. I took this

stand in 1920, and I take it now,
Foreign nations must pay us in either
gold or goods. Gold they do not
have, and goods they cannot ship
here because of our tariff barriers.
Thus an abandonment of our tariff
policies is our only hope for payment.”

Both Dr. Graper and Prof. Williams
said they “do not understand" the
statement of Colonel Cullen, of the
ROTC department, that there is a. dis-
tinct code of war and the only way
of enforcing it is by retaliation.
“That, however,” said Dr. Graper, “is
the general sentiment in our army
and navy.”
