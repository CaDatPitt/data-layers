if/diNo Union’ Polls lst,
Faculty Survey Shows

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
AND THE PITT NEWS STAFF

Pitt faculty in the Provost’s area are split on the faculty union
question, although a Pitt News survey shows more will vote no-union
than for any particular representative in the election March 9 and 10.

The Provost’s area, one of the five bargaining units created by a
month-old Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB) decision, is the
scene of a campaign by the three major pr.)-union agents.

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP), the Pitt
;.{“,!,¢‘ofessional Union (PPU) and the Pennsylvania State Education
"Association (PSEA) will be competing with each other and a “No

Representation” option on the ballot.

The Pitt News survey of 249, or 20%, of the 1,210 faculty eligible to
vote in the Provost’s area showed 39% opposed to unionization, 37%
pro-union, 19% undecided and 4% not responding. _ ,

Limits Seton Student Input

The apparent deadlock between
pro- and anti-union forces dissolves
when the pro-union group's voting
intentions are taken into consider-
ation. This latter group divides its
allegiance among the AAUP, the
PPU and the PSEA.

The no-union option was most
popular, with 39% of the sample,
followed by the AAUP with 20%,

e PPU with 12% and the PSEA
with 7%. Seventeen percent of the
faculty polled indicated they were
undecided on a speciﬁc ballot
choice, and 4% of faculty polled did
not respond.

In a further breakdown of the
poll results, full professors in the
Provost’s area seem more inclined
to favor the no-union position than
either associate professors or
assistant professors.

Full professors were 50% no-
union, with associate professors
next at 40% and assistant
professors last at 33%. Conversely.
full professors were lowest in union

pport at 32%, with associate
professors uncommitted at 40%.
Assistant professors were strongly
union-oriented at 47%.

Twenty percent of associate
professors were undecided with full
professors and assistant professors
falling to either side at 17% and
19%, respectively.

choices among the AAUP, PPU,
PSEA and No Representative

House budget hearings

Legislators Grill Pitt Request

BY CONNIE GIEL

The House Appropriations
Committee grilled University offi-
cials Monday with questions
concerning productivity, Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar said after his
presentation at the Harrisburg
budget hearings.

Legislators questioned the Chan-
cellor and his staff as Pitt sought to
have the Governor’s recommenda-
tion for a 2.8% increase in state
funds raised. Pitt had requested a
17% increase. 9

~ Posvar said he can’t speculate
yet on the consequences of the
hearings for a tuition increase. '

, BY BILL MOORE

Students should have input into
collective bargaining, butnot as
negotiators on, the faculty and
management bargaining teams,
three representatives of the‘ com-
peting pro-union faculty groups
said yesterday in a forum on faculty

"unionization.

[See editorial, page 4]

Sponsored by the Student
Government Board, the forum
allowed spokesmen for the Ameri-
can Association of University
Professors (AAUP), the Pitt-
Professional Union (PPU), the
Pennsylvania State Education As-
sociation (PSEA) and the Teachers
for Independent Faculty (TIF) to
react to a proposal by law student
Melvin Moser asking that students
be included on the two negotiating
teams and that two additional
students be appointed as obser-
vers.

PSEA representative Donald
McBurney said collective bargain-
ing has a history as a two-party
process and that student participa-
tion would be troublesome. “We
do believe students should" speak,”
he added, “but as students, not as
anything else.”

  .v - :

“Basically, we reject the Moser
proposal,” PPU spokesman John
Beverly said. “We feel students
should have input and that they
should be involved, but the Moser
proposal just muddies up the
waters of collective bargaining.”

AAUP representative Richard
Tobias also turned thumbs down on
the Moser suggestion but reitera-

ted the need for other kinds of

student involvement. “It wouldn’t
be good for you to be at the
bargaining table," he said. “The
students should be speaking as a
voice of their own.”

The three pro-union speakers
said the wishes of faculty often
would coincide with those of
students and that unionization
would beneﬁt both.

TI_F representative Paul Shep-
ard, giving the anti-union view-
point, said students would lose
much of their voice in academic
matters, would suffer higher
tuition costs and "would lose many
services now provided by the
University if faculty unionized.

“I also think students should be
concerned about the quality of
education under unionization,” he
said.

Committee members agreed
Pitt’s productivity is stable and
satisfactory for a_ high-quality
university, Posvar added. ‘

The legislators, however, may»

have been misled by notions of
measures of productivity, Posvar
said. “They asked about credit-
hours, faculty workloads, class-
room hours and salaries,” he
explained, “which may not be neat
measures of cost-effectiveness.”
“The student-faculty ratio is a
typical layman’s_ question,” Assis-
tant to the Chancelor Dr. Edward
Bozik said. V
Quantiﬁable measures of in-
structional output include credit-
hour production, course and

who want a voice in collective
bargaining, he said. “But I
wouldn’t be too optimistic about
the likelihood of thatoccurring."
The hour-and-a-half forum was
attended by approximately 40
students and faculty members.

Many Miss

section offerings and degree
"production, University officials

said. _

Using faculty and student
credit-hours as the sole. measure
may be misleading, Posvar said.

There are .. three levels of
instruction beyond the baccalaur-
eate at Pitt. Faculty in the higher
level work with students not in the
"one-hour-equals-one-credit"
sequence, which results infewer

contact hours, according to a report

prepared by the Office of Planning
and Budget last fall. T

The 1972 amendments to the
appropriation acts for state-related
universities require reports on
_faculty output and salary costs. Pitt
provided information to the legisla-
tors concerning full- and part-time
enrollments, numbers of faculty,
student credit-hours, faculty work-.

loads and salaries for all programs '

except the medical program. '

The House committee members’ .
questioning was more detailed and_

penetrating, Posvar said, than the
Senate hearings last Wednesday. T
“Several representatives had
particular lines of questioning,” he
said. a I  I I ‘

Room Drawings

New room-drawing procedures
that Ofﬁce of Residence Life (ORL)
director Fred Fonseca said would
benefit current resident students
were announced Monday.

“I think the room drawings will
run a lot smoother this year,”
Fonseca said. ‘7We over-admitted
last year, but we’ve learned from
our mistakes.

“Students should be happier
with the procedures this year than
perhaps they were last year.”

Students who want to keep their
rooms must. contact their Resident
assistants (RA) today or tomorrow
between 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Those
students must bring their IDs and
$100 prepayment receipts to the
RAs who will verify and stamp the

’ room applications.

Students then should go to the
ORL beginning March 15 to
retrieve their applications and
receipts. _ _

Students who do not want to
keep theirrooms may participate in
room drawings beginning Sunday.

Those interested in Alt_ernative
Lifestyle units will draw for and be
assigned rooms in a lottery on
Sunday in the Student Union lower
lounge. .

Persons ‘requesting accommo-
dations in reduced visitation areas
will draw for rooms from 2 to 2:30
p.m., as will these who want

of the cancer causing agent from
eating two charcoal broiled steaks
than from a year of breathing air
around the plant.

Meanwhile, Cambria County
commissioners yesterday asked the
state to withdraw‘ the legal action
against Bethlehem, the area’s
largest employer, because ' a
shutdown could wreck the local
economy. ‘

In a detailed statement issued
Monday, the nation's second

‘Department of Environmental Re-

sourccsthat Bethlehem was fouling
the air in Johnstown with substan-
ces which can cause a variety of
health problems, including cancer
and emphysema.

million.

graduate and undergraduate pro-
grams were less than those of
Temple, but more than Penn
State’s, Posvar said.

Pitt has the highest percentage
of graduate degrees granted of the
three state-related universities,
Posvar said. Forty-three percent of
the degrees are in graduate
programs, while Temple grants
41% and Penn State 15%.

The Chancellor’s Annual Report,
1975, showed the University had
granted 4,011 bachelors, 2,896
masters, 865 professional and 579
doctoral degrees from June, 1974,
through August, 1975.

Since 1966,. Pitt has granted
30,166 baccalaureate and 25,645
post-baccalaurate degrees.

Rep. Ivan Itkin, a Squirrel Hill
Democrat, questioned the need to
refer Pitt applicants to branch
campuses, Posvar said. “I told him
we have a base admission that.
once filled, mandates we refer
applicants to the branches.”

‘both the Senate and House budget

“why a kid from Squirrel Hill has to
be sent to Titusville.”

Rep. William Shane, an Indiana’

Democrat, asked how the $500,000
appropriated Pitt this year for the
dental clinic was used.

“More than halfthe money is
used to pay the salaries of the
clinical personnel,” Posvar said.
The remaining money covers

renovation and replacement of’

equipment, plus partially expanded
services, he said.

“The patient-care aspect is
secondary,” Posvar said. “I told
the committee the educational
mission is first. The basic
justification for the dental clinic is
to train doctors.” ,

The Chancellor said he got no
response to the University’s
“capitation argument” for the
medical school. .The governor
recommended a per capita medical-
student allocation of $7,465 for the
ﬁfth consecutive year.

Art Buchwald: TheMdn Behind

BY BILL MOORE

There is an attractive innocence
to the man Art Buchwald.

He is not involved in the dank
recesses of Washington life like the
politicians he writes about, and in
fact, he seldom if ever even speaks
to them.

Instead, Buchwald shoves an
oversized cigar into his cherubic
face, pours his fantasies into his
typewriter three times a week, and
then just sits back in amazement
when fans swarm around him on

V’f..";a_mpuses like Pitt, where he spoke

«

Monday night.

Buchwald isn’t funny offstage, or
off the printed page, unless those
around him demand it. He isn’t
satirical or poignant, but reflective
and understanding.

Take college students. Buch-
wald ﬁnds particular pleasure in
ribbing them about their plagiar-
ized terfnpapers and unorthodox
living styles.‘ But,‘ outof print, he
serious. V

“College students used to be so
much more motivated, so concern-
ed about ecology or whatever,” he
remarked Monday before his talk.
“Now, nothing. I don’t like to see
it, but I don’t blame them either.

“Students today are —more

jg-reer-oriented than they were
when I began speaking at colleges
13 years ago.”

Buchwald’s son has dropped out
of school twice, claiming he didn’t
get a thing out of it. “I didn’t

really fight him, but I wish he
would go back."

“College is an experience, an
important one. You shouldn’t just
go into it to see what you can get
out of it jobwise."

Long before he became a
nationally syndicated columnist,
Buchwald spent three years at the
University of Southern California,
but he was not allowed to work
toward a degree. “They had a
good reason—l never graduated
from high school."

However, ‘onstage his mouth
widens into an impish grin.
Speaking to the audience in David
Lawrence Hall, he didn't show his
real concern about college stu-
dents. ’

“I don’t want to speak here
tonight under any false preten-
ses,” he told the laughing,
standing-room-only audience. “I
have no use for education.”

He related the story of his

degree-less three years at USC,
and then announced he recently
had been named alumnus of the
year. “So you see, you are all
wasting your time.”
' He likes to joke about politics
too, though he has no conﬁdential
sources, and is terribly surprised
when some of the scenarios’ he
presents in his column prove
accurate.

“I can never write anything that
is crazier than what you ﬁnd on the

Latest Union Charade

I For all the talk at yesterday’s special union presentation before the
student government, including discussion on political struggle,
democratic governance and more teeth in the faculty’s bargaining
position, there was no straight answer given _to the issue responsible

C for the meeting: Melvin Moser’s proposal for two student negotiators
and two student observers.
This nonresponse, we believe, will cause __some of those teeth to

; clamp shut not only on the administration, but also on students.

/-.

 

‘ The Pitt Professional Union (PPU), the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) and the Pennsylvania State Education
Association (PSEA) were opposed to the Moser proposal for reasons
upon which they were careful not to expound. .
"A The basic issue of whether a unionized faculty will accept the active
involvement of students was smothered by rhetoric maintaining that

, student proposals would only be voted down at the bargaining table,

that students should organize their own union and that, although
faculty and student concerns may largely coincide, students should not
be involved in collective bargaining along with faculty.

With such handy evasion, the faculty unionists are trying to snowball

students the way the administration has snowballed them. With 

promises of a long-term academic paradise, the unions have attempted
to placate students during the unionization drive.

Today's students soon will be gone from Pitt. Students in four-year
programs’ must live in the short run if they want any results at all, and
if union leaders can't deliver a straight answer today, how can we trust
them to deliver in the years to come? i

Dangling a carrot on a stick the way the union leaders did at
yesterday’s presentation is the same charade Pitt faculty are trying to
end with the administration. What makes the PPU, AAUP and PSEA

think students can stand what the faculty can’t?

It would take only the signing of a stipulation to provide for student
participation in a union setting. The unions have not shown proof of
how the presence of student negotiators would be detrimental to the
faculty cause, especially in light of the much-touted idea that faculty
and student interests are most often the same.

In light of this attitude by the contending unions, student leaders
should refrain from any show of support for the faculty unions now at
work on this campus.

Support for SCATH

A group like the Student Coalition Against Tuition Hikes
(SCATH)—one that draws from a broad base of support and meets
regularly to discuss tuition strategy——is necessary if students hope to
approach the issue this year with any inﬂuence.

We endorse the organization and support its activities as long as it
remains the product of multilateral action and does not become
dominated by a clique of ideologists.

We obviously wouldn't make such a stipulation if we thought it
‘weren’t a possibility. But frankly, we think SCATI-Is two open forums
have resulted in merely roundabout discussion of whom to approach
and how to approach them, with little in the way of concrete plans at
the end.

A greater attendance is necessary if SCATH is to respond to the,
pulse of the students at large, rather than remain a tight cluster of
familiar student politicos who have embarked on yet another quixotic
quest. ~

Tuition is something that plucks the purse strings of every Pitt.

student, and so there is no reason SCATH meetings should be attended
by only 50 to 60 people. It's notthe fault of students; it's the job of
SCATH organizers.

We hope more students from nonpolitical groups like the resident
students and commuters will turn up at the next forum. After all,
tuition to the great majority of Pitt students is an economic issue, not a
political one determining the fate of mankind.

BY BILL MOORE

Perhaps it is a fallacy to
consider Pitt students as a whole,
as a community united with "a
single purpose.

Pitt is, and will remain. a
university of amazing diversity.
But Pitt leaders, both student

and administrative. try and try,

again to lump us all together as a
single entity. The evidence

_suggests it will never work.

Right off, Pitt is faced with the
resident-commuter split. Com-
muters from all partsof Allegheny
County feel very little a part of the
campus scene of the Pitt nightlife,
or even of most of the student
organizations.

Because they must leave on the
first bus for jobs or homes, they are
closed out of almost everything
extracurricular. ,

So they come in for classes. grab
a bite at Burger Chef and leave.
One hardly can expect them to get

impending tuitionhikes and faculty
unionization votes. They will be
gone in three years or less, and
alt-hough it may be selﬁsh of them
to ignore the fate of the students

BEHIND THE LINES

Even resident students, be
they dormers or Oakland tenants,

stay pretty muchaloof. You find-

the same few people popping up at
the David Lawrence lectures, the
Pangborn films and the anti—tuition
hike meetings.

Most students are too wrapped
up in some other . aspect of
Pittsburgh life to worry about Pitt,
and most chose an urban university
so they could do just that.

Compounding the division is the‘
high number of part-time students,
night stpdents and graduate
students. Add to that the nursing
students, engineering students and

In the Friday, Feb. 20 issue of
The Pitt News. a column, “Patriot-
by Dan
Mulholland, was printed. Since
then, I've been trying to decide
whether Mulholland is a fool, or
just plain ignorant of the facts
about which he chose to write.

Mulholland spoke of how Joe
McCarthy was a “courageous
American who gave his all in
defense of the country he loved"
and how he was “imbued with
patriotism.” Mulholland tells us
how McCarthy “succeeded in
ferreting out hundreds of govern-
ment workers who were bad
security risks, if not outright

to paper. But he didn't. so I did it
for him. -

Digging a bit deeper, we find
that Joe McCarthy was not so
patriotic and did not so effectively
succeed in ferreting out spies and
bad security risks. What we do
find. is that Joe McCarthy, in his
Wheeling, W. Va. speech, held up
a piece of paper, and said that on
that piece of paper he had a list of
205 known spies who were
presently working in the State
Department. / Checking a bit
further. we see that of these 205,
many did not even work there——but
more important, NO PERSON ON
THAT LIST WAS EVER CON-

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

Who is that lone ﬁgure moving
among thousands of tiny ﬁsh?
Lloyd Bridges in Lilliput, did you
say‘? Well, you're wrong. It's John
Resnick feeding his water-born
pets. and if you think this seems
like a ﬁsh story, you can bet it is.

Resnick, a senior psychology
major at Pitt, is proud owner of
almost 3,000 tropical ﬁsh. His
dream is to open a ﬁsh» store with
the aid of his roommate and
partner Bern Churley. It will be
called H20cean.

“I was given two aquariums for

,7‘”my birthday about six years ago,"

Resnick said. “I started messing
around, and I’ve been interested
ever since."

But the collection did not become
a horde until Resnick convinced
Churley to start building extra
aquariums. Now Resnick’s bed-
room walls are lined with more
than 30 aquariums, and Churley is
ﬁrmly -committed to the idea of
opening a business, though not out
of any great love or knowledge of
ﬁsh. ,
“I had an aquarium once when I
was younger, but all the ﬁsh died,”
said the future ﬁnancial manager of
Oakland's largest commercial ﬁsh-
bowl. “What I’m really interested

Today, however, Churley and
Resnick are a far cry from making a
fortune in ﬁsh. Over the last three
years they have put $1,000 into ﬁsh
and equipment and havetaken in
only $700 in sales. Both admit that
money, at least for a while, will be
a problem.

“Our third. roommate is an

up-and-coming lawyer whose ﬁrst
job will be to keep us from
bankruptcy,” Churley said.

But there is more to ﬁsh than
ﬁnances——namely, the dozens of .
varieties and sizes of ﬁsh that give
each tank, in Resnick’s own words,

, 9

‘a personality of its own.’

Just like people, some ﬁsh are
dull, boring creatures who
wouldn't stop to give you the time
of day. Of course. there are some
pretty interesting fellows that can
perform some neat tricks.

wouldn't let you have one. you
might consider a ﬁsh called Oscar,
which actually can be trained to be
tricks. .

“Oscar ﬁsh can be trained to eat
out of your hand or sit and have
their backs scratched." Resnick
said.

Not bad for a ﬁsh. -

It would seem that Resnick never
met a ﬁsh he didn't like. Such is
not the case. ‘He has a particular
dislike for goldﬁsh.

“They (ﬁsh-breeders) do some
gross things to goldﬁsh. They
breed them with oversized eyes
and all sorts of growths on their
head. Why anyone would want
them, I don't know."

Resnick equally despises breed-

ers who try to force their own sense
of esthetics into the public's
aquatic menageries. '
, “There's a tendency among
breeders to breed ﬁsh with long,
ﬂowing tails. They tend not to be
as hardy and are more susceptible
to diseases which eventually make
their tails rot of ."

Speaking of diseases, the ﬁsh
world is not without its equivalents
of the bubonic plague. There are
scourges that can strike overnight
and leave dozens of the poor
blighters dead by the crack of
dawn. One of the worst and most
common of these is appropriately

‘called ich.

lch is a parasite that lives one
stage of its life on the skin of ﬁsh.
The ﬁsh appear to be coated with
white spots. Eventually they drop
off to the bottom of the‘ aquarium
and produce more ich, which kills
more ﬁsh.

Resnick’s charges have not been
bothered too much by ich, but he
has had some trouble with a similar
condition called velvet, which
makes the ﬁsh appear to have a
The‘ worst thing
about velvet is it can spread easily
form tank to tank, simply ‘through
splashing.

Many of these diseases have a
simple cure—just add table salt to
the water. But don't go overboard
because most ﬁshies prefer fresher
romping grounds.

According to B Resnick, many
tropical ﬁsh owners get overzeal-
ous in their care for the little
fellows. The most common
problem is overfeeding.

Data Banks Aid Researchers A 

BY MARY ANNE GORSKI
Well folks, you've put it off as

long as possible. Now you have to - I

scare up some sources for that
research paper due next week.

But you might not be doomed
because Pitt has several systems
available that allow students to
conduct literature searches. on
virtually any subject.‘

The Information Bank on the‘
ground floor ofpHillman Library has“

access to The New York Times
computer.in New Jersey. This
system contains listings and’
abstracts from The New York

Times and approximately 60 other
newspapers and journals. The.
material stored dates to October,
1969. .

The Information Bank is open
only 20 hours per week, and
students who want to use it must
have the help of a specialist on
duty. The system was installed in
the fall of 1972, and since then
about 4,500 students have used it,
according to Dr. Elizabeth B.
Duncan, director of the Campus
Based Information System.

For people who want to learn to
do their own searches, the
University offers PIRETS (Pitts-
burgh Based Information Retrieval
System). which trains students to
use the computer to search any
area for references and abstracts.

“I've seen people dump a half a
package of goldﬁsh food into a
.tank. The ﬁsh will stop eating after
they're full, but it messes up the
tank and causes algae."

There are weirder sorts than the
overfeeders, though. One lady
Resnick knew would not buy
goldﬁsh because her house burned
down the last time she owned
some. But she fell in love with
some of Resnick’s black moors (a
type of goldﬁsh) and now calls for
advice whenever a ﬁsh stops
moving or the tank gets dirty.

Of course, Resnick has had his
share of weird experiences with
ﬁsh. Most of these occur when a
female ﬁsh develops an unexpected
pregnancy.

Flick ThinOn Plot Color

BY M.C. PILECKI

Big budgets are the iiorm in the

movie business, so it’s something
 — of an event when a cheapie gets a

major studio release. .
{Part of the appeal ‘of watching

I "Inserts is to pick up the low budget
 trademarks—-few characters, fewer

costumes, one set (somebody’s

a house), and of course the double

duty of all concerned.
Take the music, for example. It
consists of a grant total of one

 song—“Moonglow”—an old sta-
- ple, so the movie doesn’t have to

pay for original stuff. And who
plays it? Star Ricard Dreyfuss (also
production associate) plays it twice,

I The two albums here fail to
measure up, though. by the names,
one would expect them to.

Lee Holdridge, who has often
directed strings behind John
Denver, does himselfjustice a few
times-, but his failures on other
pieces are irredeemable.

“Annie's Song” have been done

He’s now (this is the '30s)

however, is more sugar.
“Sunshine on My Shoulders” is

a travesty, the kind of schlock one

hears slithering down the walls of

' bank and real estate ofﬁces. A real

boon to muzak this one is. Then
just as you're wishing it'll all go
away, in come the most sincerely
sentimental Ray Coniff-esque
voices you've ever heard, crooning,
“...sunshine in my eyes can make
me cry...." and sounding as if they
were doing just that.

Now for the good news—rather,
the fair news. Holdridge does
much better on Denver's lesser
known songs.

“Late Winter, Early Spring"
approaches the solemn melancholy
of the theme from Midnight
Cowboy. The schmaltzy strings are
scarce. there are more individual
instruments that come through,
like acoustic guitar. light synthesi-
zer, ﬂute, clarinet, drums, all of
which have their own time to shine.

Following that is “Annie’s Other
Song," which has a good conga
section and a refreshing time
change that cuts the orchestra’s
drooling. .

Another decent cut is “My Sweet
Lady,“ which also keeps the string
players in check and relies
tremendously on building suspense
through an interplay of highs and
lows. The ooohing and aaahing
chorus in the background during
the climax should have been cut,
however. and mailed to Bert
Kampfert for future use.

While Holdridge is obviously
nothing to rave about, Michel
Legrand is simply bogus. What
should be taken into consideration,
before anyone gets it into his or her
craw to draw, and (quarter the
composer of so many successful

friend, dies of an overdose before
he can do the inserts for the ﬁlm
(aside from its phallic connotations,
inserts refers to those close-up
shots inserted into the action
sequences). While he may be
grieving over the death of his
friend, he’s more upset about
having a half-ﬁnished movie and no

1 actress.

In comes (no pun intended)
Cathy Cake (Harper), ambitious
actress and college-educated girl-

friend of the porno producer, a guy .

named “Big Mac.” Witty, huh?
Dreyfuss and Harper have all kinds,
of cute lines calling him, respec-
tively, a cheesburger and a
hamburger. Yuk yuk. -And, of
course,_ the guy’s talking about
starting a hamburger chain. I

That should give you'an idea of
the level of humor.

So anyway, while Big Mac and
Dryfuss’ leading man Rex (with
the unfortunate nickname “the
Wonder Dog”) are getting rid of
the junkie’s body, Harper decides
to get acting lessons. She offers the
Boy Wonder a deal: She’ll do the
inserts if he’ll teach her about the
movie business.

What follows (mainly, the core of
the movie) is occasionally interest-
ing and funny, but often dull and
pretentious. Dreyfuss seeks to

humiliate her (while falling in love

music usually ﬁlls the soundtrack
of a movie that is a nonmusical.

Despite the various titles and the
fact that there are ten cuts, the
songs are so _laden with the “Gable
and Lombard Love Theme” leit-
motif that all efforts at distinguish-
ability are smothered.

The love theme itself is
unimpressive, particularly for a
composer who's been around and

 

who can handle practically every
genre of music. It is interesting
enough to be the theme of-a
daytime soap opera, and telling by
the ﬁlm critics opinion of the
movie, the music and visual
footage must complement each
other.

Forgettable Be-bop
Good for AM Radio 

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

January, Pilot
EMI 115088

I would like to take you back to

the time when we were just
discovering England, the place and
the music. The time when The
Beatles were making history with
their haircuts, Liverpool accents,
appealing music and Ed Sullivan-
appropriate manners, while The
Rolling Stones were turning on the
teenage masses with their anthems
of alienation, youthful energy and
sexual dissatisfaction. Legends
then and media institutions now-
and forever appealing. However,
there were others.’

The lesser bands, Billy J.

Kramer and The Dakotas, Gerry»

and The Pacemakers, The Troggs,
The Mindbenders——oh, the list is
endless. Bands that turned out
pleasing (mid-sixties pop—the
pleasant tunes. We heard them on
our AM radios and played them at_
our pajama parties, at our
grade-school dances as part of our
Saturday-night date fantasies.
Heard today, gone tomorrow?

Pilot’s new album, January, has
that same one-day-at-a-time ap-
peal. i

Its claim to fame is the summer
hit “Magic,” a standard pop ditty,
with lush verses and catchy hooks,
forever in our hearts and minds,
but never in the serious record
collector's stash. It’s an album to
hum to, tap to, but never rave to.

January is appealing yet disgust-
ing. All the songs are written by
the immortal team of Billy Lyall
and David Paton (Keith and Mick
need not worry) and their mood is
deﬁnitely pub-oriented.

“Call Me Round” possibly could
be an AM hit, with its nice drunken
piano, three-chord (guitar, and
steady beat. “55 Degrees North 3
‘Degrees _West-?’\ is a semi-progres-.

 

 

.sive piece that might make it to FM

turntables, and “Love Is” rings of
Gilbert O’Sullivan’s “Alone Again
(Naturally).”

The rest of the songs are
competent but not outstanding.
Easy to listen to, but just as easily
forgotten.

Pilot seems to be a one-hit
group. “Magic” was nice, and

January is okay. If you want to take ~

BY PAMELA EUSI

Firebird, Tomita, RCA ARLl-1312

This album is Isao Tomita’s third
effort in the world of classical
electronic music. And it is a
definite success. His previous
albums, Snowflakes are Dancing-
The Sweetest Sound of Debussy
_and Moussorgsky: Pictures at an
Exhibition, delved into the world of
moog synthesizers, mixers, various
accessories (phasers, shifters,
woodwind sound systems and

electronic piano) and 30 tracks of

tape from Ampex, Sony and TEAC
recorders.

Tomita first researches the

Upon ﬁrst listening to this LP, you

sounds are so clear. The ﬁrst side
is devoted to the “Firebird Suite”
by Stravinsky.

you're hooked. Sounds swirl and

Tomita is a master craftsman in a
wide-open, totally unexplored
world of sound.’ An especially
powerful part of the. “Suite” is the
“Infernal Dance of King Kast-

Side two is made up of Debussy’s
“Prelude to the Afternoon of a

special notice of the latter title,

Moussorgsky’s musical poem

-Pitt ‘Official Says

BY BOB MAYO

The Buckley Amendment,
-_ which granted students greater
 control over their University
- records, may be the source of extra
red tape and delay for seniors and
graduates, according to Campus
. Judicial System Coordinator Alden
‘ Bowen.
, This federal law, effective the
,_ first of last year, gives students
’ access to their school ﬁles. It also
prohibits schools from releasing
1 information from any ﬁle without
the student’s permission.
Prospective employers and hono-
raries such as Phi Beta Kappa are
among those denied such data
without student consent.
, Students also were offered the
I opportunity to exclude themselves
_ from the University’s directory
- because of the law.
Bowen has been designated to
, ensure the University operates
7‘ within the restrictions of the
Buckley Amendment. He said he is
particulary. concerned students

because of the consent require-
ment.

“When an employer or an
educational institution requests
information about a student, not
being able to comply and send good
information about him certainly
works to his detriment,” Bowen
said.

“lt’s obvious an employer isn’t
going to be writing to you saying he
wants to know what kind of grades

_a student made unless that student

has contacted him. He’d have no

» reason to,” Bowen said.

“In those cases where‘ an
institution is barred because a
student didn't know enough about
the Buckley Amendment and the
employer is not tied to an education
institution, you’ve got to deny him.
Somebody else is probably going to
get that job,” Bowen explained.

Requests from an employer for
information concerning a student’s
behavior and discipline also would
be delayed without a consent

response again could eliminate an

indicated.

Another unintended side effect
of the new guidelines has been an
increase in red tape and paperwork
within the University, he said.
More cross-checking and confirma-
tion than was previbusly required is
now necessary.

“I think that at every educational
institution in the country, they've
had to come up with a whole new
set of forms and record-keeping.
The law requires that you
document who looked at a
student’s record ‘and what their
reasons vifere to justify your
showing it to them,” Bowen said.

“The law makes it very clear, for
example, that just because you're
here at Pitt it doesn't entitle you to
look at any student’s record. You
must have a legitimate purpose
that’s related to the institutional
functions you are a participant in.”

Receipts of requests must be
documented and copies made of
the signed waivers in addition to
conﬁrming the purpose of the
queries.

tion when you realize how many
people that may involve in all the
records here at the University. The
time expenditure translates into
money that the Buckley Amend-
ment is costing the educational
institution,” Bowen said.

He also pointed to the positive
aspects of the Buckley Amend-
ment. He noted specifically the
protection of student privacy.

“The student now has a right to
demand to see his or her personal
records. There no longer could be
some sort of secret dossier
maintained on a person; that
“Larry Jones,” for example, is a
homosexual or a communist or an
activist or any thing that doesn’t
relate to legitimate data to be
maintained by an educational
institution. .

“This is not to say that Pitt
maintained anything like that. This

is in reference to all institutions,” .

Bowen added.
“You can go in and be damn sure

that your records only reflect data

This Is Free to Student, Faculty and Staff

  
 

pertaining to what you did while

you were here.” C‘

Bowen criticized the manner in
which the amendment was written,
claiming those responsible were
not knowledgeable in the inner
workings of a school like Pitt and
did not know the effect the
provisions would have.

‘‘I think the act could have been

written so that it would’ve been

easier to carry out, cost a little less
money and not been so difficult to
understand, while still accomplish-
ing the same purposes,” Bowen
said. _
“I feel some of the record-keep-
ing is unnecessary and burden-
some. Everybody within the school
who looks at a record has to put
down all this data about who they
are and so forth. This ties people
up.” A '
Bowen offered advice for April
graduates _and those who wish to
take advantage of the rights ‘of
access under the new law.
“I would: recommend to every
student to at least make sure when
,you’re leaving that you agree with
the contents of your record—that
there aren’t any mistakes,” he
said.

Br TOM HALL
Sports Editor

While I was attending the recent Eastern Wrestling League

tournament at Recreation Hall at Penn State, it was my pleasure to see
some of the best wrestling I have ever witnessed.

Unfortunately for the wrestlers, their loyal fans and their families,
the students at Penn State (or for that matter, any of the other ﬁve
participating‘ schools) couldn’t ﬁnd the time or the transportation or the
whatever (ﬁll in your own excuse) to attend.

That’s unfortunate for them, for they missed quite a spectacular
meet, and unfortunate for the wrestlers, especially those from the
visiting schools, because the graps could have used the support.

The turnout, about 2,000 for the finals and 1,000 for the semis and

qualiﬁers, was disappointing, to say the least. Rec Hall has seating for
more than 7,000 people.

This is the ﬁrst season for the Eastern Wrestling League. (1\ »in g into
the meet last weekend, the Nittany Lions were ranked 10th nationally.
The Panthers were ranked as high as 12th this season, and Clarion,
ranked 19th last week, has been a known national power for years.

So the question remains. For one of the ﬁnest wrestling exhibitions
in the country, where were all the fans? Five thousand empty seats
staring at you is enough to make you dizzy. '

League ofﬁcials make one mistake to begin with. It’s all a matter
" timing, actually, and the scheduling process was off. The tournamt

was last weekend, and unfortunately, with Penn State still on t

quarter system (four terms per school year, instead of three), most

the students were home on break or cramming for ﬁnals.

Perhaps Penn State does have the largest facility of all the teams in
the league. But with an attendance of 2,000, well, I wonder where the

event will be next year? And what about Pittsburgh?

The Field House can seat about 5,000 wrestling fans. Here we are, a

school with an up-and-coming national power in the wrestling ﬁeld,
and most students didn’t have the opportunity to see the tournament.

Pitt’s facilities could have held 2,000 fans, and chances are, the

crowds would have been bigger.

WHILE ON THE SUBJECT of tourney placement, can anyone
explain why a team like the West Virginia Mountaineers are going to

be included in the ECAC Southern Division basketball playoffs?

Surely that they are again hosting the playoff doesn't have anything

to do with it, or does it?

Fortunately for Pitt basketball, they dropped out of the ECAC after
last season, thus preventing a re-occurrence of the miscarriage of

justice that took place at last year's playoff.

As you may or may not remember, the Cats won all but two of their
last 11 games to make the ECACs. And just as this year, a lackluster

WVU team also made the four-team roster. Why? Because it was
hosting the event, and for the sake of drawing the crowds WVU had to
' be included. - .

So as it happened, an excellent Panther squad lost to the infamous
WVU Coliseum jinx, 75-73. Georgetown downed George Washington

by a point, and the ﬁnals were set.

Just to set the record straight, Georgetown won‘ the ﬁnals match and
advanced to the NCAA tournament, in which it won a game or two

before being outclassed by the nation’s cream.

The Panthers destroyed George Washington and impressed NIT

ofﬁcials sufﬁciently to be included in “the other tournament.”

_ The Panthers were the class team of the four, and should have been
the one to advance to the NCAAS. But Pitt can't seem to handle WVU,

especially in that insane asylum they call the Coliseum.

Wouldn't it be a shame if a team like West Virginia, one game over
.500 for the regular season, made the top collegiate tournament in the

‘country simply because of politics? , . '

LORETTO, Pa.—It was a good
end to a statistically disappointing
(12-15) season. .

The Panther basketball team
closed out their schedule with their
fourth consecutive win, holding off
a spirited but late ‘St. Francis rally
to defeat the Red Flash (15-13 for
the season), 74-69, before a crowd
of 2,800, held down by the St.
Francis spring break.

Pitt was led, as usual, by forward
Larry Harris, who became the
highest-scoring sophomore in Pitt
history with his 27-point effort. It
was the memory-stirring shooting
_of senior guard Tom Richards,
however, and some equally ﬁne
‘(S-7) shooting by Scott Nedrow
which put the Panthers out to an
insurmountable 16 point lead with
16 minutes to play.

Richards closed out a ﬁne
four-year career with an 8-9
performance from the ﬁeld and a
season-high 17 points.

Ralph McClelland, Willie Kelly
and Bob Shrewsbury;—the other
players who wore the Blue and
Gold for the ﬁnal time last
night——contributed to the win in
their own ways. '

McClelland played his usual
strong game underneath, helping a
Panther effort inside that limited
the Flash front. line to 34 points.
Kelly rejected three Flash shots
and led Pitt with eight rebounds.
Shrewsbury picked up 10 assists
and steadied the team when they
needed to slow down.

“We're really going to miss
those guys," said Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich after the game, “I just
wish we could bring them all
back.”

attempts in his final game as a Panther last night, helping Pitt defeat

the St. Francis Red ‘Flash, 74-69, in Loretto, Pa.

The departing Panthers, though,
were not the only reason for the
Panthers’ victory. Nedrow reeled,'
off 10 consecutive Panther points
late in the ﬁrst half to break open
what had been a close game.

Some good allround ﬂoor play by
juniorpguard forward Frank Boyd
also furthered the Pitt cause,
especially underneath and on
defense. Boyd did'not come out of
the game with overly impressive
statistics (ﬁve -rebounds, three
points) but his contribution could
not be measured in such terms.

The game "was relatively close in

the game at 10 points. When Gault
hit on a field goal, the Rockets
launched a strong offensive attack
and scored six unanswered points.

Pitt’s play ﬂuctuated between
bad and worse—the players

couldn't shut out Slippery Rock's, '

offense, they quickly got into foul
trouble and their passing was
undeniably sloppy. The Panther-

ettes were down by seven—then by , 1
two—but the score was 28-24 at the ,

half.
The Rockets started off. the

second half with a bang, too,

scoring four points before forward
Kim Raymond connected for Pitt.

The Rockets kept ﬁring and soon; i

had a 12-point lead, which they
maintained until the ﬁnal ‘ﬁve
minutes, when Debbie Jones
converted a foul shot to revitalize
the Pantherettes. _ .

Barb Welsh then stole an
inbounds pass, she made the-shot
and Pitt was off and running in its
best comeback of the season.

After shutting off Slippery Rock
at the other end, Welsh followed up

with 4:44 left. Her replacement,

shoddy defensive play can again be
’ blamed for the Panthers’ inability
Tograb two victories.
M Pitt scored a whopping 16 goals
' - in its trip_ East, but allowed the
same number of goals against
them, beating Navy, 9-7, while
' losing to the Chiefs by the same
score.’

Once again, goaltender Larry
Newill was under a strong attack,
facing an incredible 108 shots in
the two games. Coach Len
Barcalow attributes the high shot
 total to mistakes by his defense-

_‘ men.
y"“Our. back-checking was really
bad,” he said. “We had too many
/defensive lapses coming from lack’
‘ of practice. You cannot play any
 kind of good game without
 practice.” 7
 Against the Naval Academy,
 Scott Kimmick led the Pitt scoring
 attack with the three-goal hat trick,
 aided by two goals from linemate
Bill Gedeon. Tom Sherwin, Rick
’ Vernon, Billy Day and Curt Hetz'
tallied one goal each for the
Panthers.
After Kimmick opened the
V scoring with 3:10 gone in the game
and Navy Bill Dooley tied it at 1-1
ﬁve minutes later. the Panthers

The second frame was highlight-
ed by three Pitt goals in 40 seconds
from Vernon. Day and Kimmick.
Navy tallied twice in the period
which ended with the Panthers on
top, 6-3.

Newill faced 64 shots in the game
and had to be tired in Sunday’s
game in Washington against the
Chiefs. The District of Columbia
amateur team amassed 44 shots,
but the Panthers should have won,
blowing a 7-4 lead in the ﬁnal six
minutes.

It was Rick Vernon's day against
the Chiefs, but his teammates
failed to muster any support. The
junior defenseman tallied four
goals against the Chiefs, a team he
had faced several times in the past
in his amateur play, and raised his
team-leading goal total to 19.

Vernon scored three times in the
opening period to get the Panthers
a 3-1 lead. Bill Gedeon scored with
35 seconds to go to regain a
two-goal lead after the Chiefs cut it
to one. '

Washington tied the game in the
second period, but Russ Stump
scored for the Panthers giving
them a 5-4 margin. Kimmickand
Vernon added third-period goals to
make it 7-4 before the roof caved in
on the Panthers and Washington
scored ﬁve unanswered goals to
run away with the victory.

“There were too many guys
standing around the front of the
net,” Barcalow said. “lf there was
more time for practice we could

things.”

“The announcer came on and

after a couple of plays that took a

said there was 5:11 left to play. The
same thing happened when there

  Cat Mile Relay The Best In The Mid-West   

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Ohio State Relays proved to
be a proﬁtable meet for the Pitt
track team. The Panthers had a
ﬁrst. three seconds and a third-
place ﬁnish in the two—day meet at
Columbus, Ohio, last Saturday.

The mile relay was the grand
ﬁnale of the meet and also a fruitful
victory for Pitt. The combination of
Karl Farmer, Keith Leckenby,
Kevin Carpenter and Willie Walker‘
covered the distance in 3:l9.5 on a
slow track to defeat handily their
opponents. All four members of

the relay team received watches as
ﬁrst-place awards and earned the
title of the Midwest USTFF (United
States Track and Field Federation)
Champs for the mile relay.

Farmer earlier in the day
sprinted to second place in the
600-yard run. *

Seniors Nick Martin and Mel

Boyd both placed second in their‘

events as each was just narrowly
defeated at the end of the run.

Martin ran 4:08 in the mile and
Boyd ﬁnished the two mile in the
time of 8:56.

Although Pitt did not qualify any

BICENTENNIAL
CATTLE DRIVE OK’D.

VALLEY FORGE, Pa. (AP)-
The Valley Forge Park Commission
gave tentative approval to a New
Jersey cattle farmer's request for a
cattle drive into the park as a
Bicentennial event.

Howard “Stoney” Harris Jr., 73,
wants to herd 40 cattle into the park
on June 16 to re-enact Gen.
Anthony Wayne’s drive of 1778.

Harris wants to follow Wayne’s
route, starting from 'Mannington
Township, Salem County through
Burlington-
and Mercer counties in New Jersey
and Bucks, Montgomery and
Chester counties in Pennsylvania.
It would take six days.

Wayne’s cattle drive brought
food to the starving troops of
George Washington, who camped

- for the winter at Valley Forge. He

arrived. with 400 head.

lot of the runners got nice awards
to show for their efforts.”

The biggest part of the indoor
season is over and only the nation's
best will meet at the NCAAs in
Detriot on March 11 to‘ 13. The
Panthers have one more chance to
add to their six Nationals-bound
athletes this Saturday when Penn
State, Allegheny Community Col-
lege and a few other local schools
invade the Field House.

Already the track team is looking
to the future with the outdoor

season and warm weather nearing. , 3 i

The young team has profited from
past competition and is preparing
for the tough opponents to come.
Most of the young members have
recorded their personal bests and
promise to be standouts soon. Eric
Drescher in the shot put has
already proved to be of tremendous
potential. Drescher has thrown
near the Pitt record. '

Pitt coach Pat Wallace said. “We
had a few bad breaks on the
offense. A key thing was Joan
Maser‘s coming. off the bench
(Maser was injured last week in the
junior varsity game against In-
diana); she did a good job.

“There wasn’t as much run-and-
shoot as there was when we played
at Slippery Rock,” Wallace said,
referring to the game the Rockets
won by ﬁve points on their home
court. “Gault had at least 12 on the
break alone.”

Gault‘s performance at Pitt was
still pretty spectacular—the 5-3
guard was the game’s top scorer
with 20 points. More important,
she was the spearhead of Slippery
It was only_after
Wallace put DiGiacomo in the
Pantherette lineup that Gault
ﬁnally was contained.

The matchup was one of the
highlights of the game. Besides
the obvious similarities between
the two players—both are 5-3, play
guard and wear numb,e_r..10——each

is an excellent ballhandler anda’

GLASSBORO. N.J. l(AP)—
Glassboro State College president

- Dr. Mark Chamberlain says he sees
nothing wrong with the Student '

activities Board scheduling the
screening of two X-rated movies.

“Since they show these in
commercial theatres without any
difficulties, I don't see any reason
why they shouldn't be shown on
campus," Chamberlain said.

“My personal reaction is that sex
is not a spectator sport. Ithink the
whole thing is ridculous."

The movies are Deep Throat and
The Devil in Miss Jones.

Chamberlain said he has no
plans to see the movies.

LBIRTH CONTROL USERS
WARNED

WASHINGTON (AP)———New
evidence that sequential oral
contraceptives may be harmful to.
women has led three major drug
companies to withdraw the pro-
ducts from the market, the Food
and Drug Administration said.

"The birth control pills being
withdrawn are Oracon, made by
Mead Johnson and Co.;
Novum SQ, by Ortho Pharmaceuti-

Ortho '

cals; and Norgu_ans, by Synte:g,‘,.Q_"

Laboratories. ~

The FDA said it asked for the
withdrawal because of new studies
strongly suggesting that sequential
oral contraceptives pose an in‘-
creased risk of endometrial cancer
in the lining of the uterus,
compared with women who take
combination-type oral contracep-
tives.

Before the cancer studies be-
came known, the FDA already had
evidence that sequentials were
somewhat less effective in prevent-
ing pregnancy than the combina-
tion pills, and that the sequentials
were associated with a higher risk

of blood clotting.

The FDA said the three
companies, at the agency’s re-
quest, agreed to cease production,
marketing and distribution of the
sequential tablets.

them are being advised to continue
through their present menstrual
cycle while they consult with their

.ceptive product.

MIDLER SAYS SHOW GOES ON.

PHILADELPHIA
Midler, the jive-talking songstress
stage perfomer,,has this advice for
young folks, heading into show
business: Stay out.

“Don't bother," she told report-
ers at a press conference before
opening a one-week engagement at
the Valley Forge Music Fair.

“The nature of this business eats
you up. It eats you alive. Talent
has nothing to do with it.. It's the
qualities you have to have in order
to succeed—great anxiety, violent
insecurity.

“The very nature of the business
breeds fear. Everywhere there is
bitterness and jealousy. The worst
part of having success is to try
finding someone wh_o is happy for
you. You don't really find that, not
in this business."

1973 in U.S. District court in the

the court.

Under the agreement, the
