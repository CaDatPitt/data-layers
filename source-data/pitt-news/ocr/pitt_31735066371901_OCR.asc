New BAS leaders set goals

On March 20, the Black Action

Society of the University of Pitts-
burgh inaugurated its administra-
tion for the 1985-86 academic year.
year. _
Hudson Primus and Camille
White are the newly elected chair-
man and co-chairman of the Black
Action Society. They replaced
Gladys Brown, out-going chairman.
Primus feels that this year will be a
challenging one that will benefit him
in his pursuit ofa law career. He is a
junior majoring in business
accounting.

Co-chairman vWhite is also a jun-
ior and is majoring in political
science and communications. She
also plans to pursue a career in law.

“I feel very confident in the new
administration. They have many
good ideas," said Brown, who will
attend Pitt’s law school next year.
Shewent on to say that the year has
built‘her character and has made her
become aware of strong points in her
character that she never realized she
had.

The goals Primus and White have
are similar.

The people in Central America
are only fighting for the right to eat,
according to Frances Moore Lappe,
who lectured to a full house in Bene-
dum Hall Friday night.

Lappe is the author of “Diet for a
Small Planet“ and the co-founder of
a non-profit organization that
researches world hunger. I

“We are made to see progress. We
are told there is an increase in pro-
duction in El Salvador and Nicara-
gua. But we don’t see that three out
of four children are malnourished or
the general impoverishment of the
people,” Lappe stated. The lecture
was sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Democratic Socialists of America,
the Hunger Action Coalition, Uni-
ted Campus Ministries of Pitts-
burgh, the Thomas Merton Center
and the Pitt Chaplain’s Association.

Lappe stated that poverty exists
mainly because people define devel-
opment differently. To a farmer in

_ Central America, development may

mean more land to grow food, or
clinics and schools for the children.
But development to someone in a
multinational corporation that sells
agricultural machinery will mean
more private wealth and more for-
eign exchange of the farm products,
Lappe explained.

Primus’ goals are to work on stu-
dent retention, to keep students
abreast of the struggle in South
Africa and the financial aid cuts by
the Reagan administration, and to
make the students aware of the
struggle at home.

“Racism and sexism are still reali-
ties and need to be confronted head
on,” said Primus. “I think we have
become a little too complacent since
the civil rights movement ofthe '60s.
Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X
and Jesse Jackson did what no other
black could accomplish —~ they
cracked the door to equality. We
need [blacks] to push the door
open.”

White's goals also include work-
ing on black student retention, try-
ing to prevent the‘ students from

-dropping out and striving to better

establish and strengthen relations
with the Student Government
Board.

SGB president Luke Kluchko said
that the relationship with BAS is
good, and he feels that the new
administration will do a fine job.

In recent weeks, BAS had been
under critical controversy for invit-
ing Rev. Louis Farrakhan to speak
for Black Week. -

Primus gave his opinion on the
subject saying, “I feel the whole issue
has been blown out of proportion.

to the first definition of develop-
ment, then there would be hope for
the poor,” Lappe said.

According to Lappe, there are
four basic conclusions she has
drawn‘ from her 15 years of expe-
rience researching world hunger.

Lappe said that hunger is not the
poverty ofland, but rather hunger is
caused by the scarcity ofdemocracy.

“Power is the tool of the privi-
leged. People and families like the
Samosas have used power to control
and deprive the people ofthe right to
eat," said Lappe.

Secondly, to combat hunger,

there needs to be a fundamental shift .

to the interests of the vast majority
-—- the poor. This is not a coup but a
revolution, said Lappe.
“Americans find that word [revo-
lution] distasteful,” stated Lappe.
“Yet, Americans forget that our
nation was created in the same way.
We proved‘ it can be done. When we
deny this liberty to countries, then
the U.S. is denying its birthright,”
Lappe stated. ~
According

to Lappe, efforts

towards such change or revolution ’

are inevitable.

“People don’t go on watching
their children die. The people see
that doctors Come to the plantation
to visit the animals and not the sick
children. They will not continue to
watch this much longer," said
Lappe. .

Finally, Lappe argued that a revo-
lution need not be bloody nor
violent.

Those who oppose an appearance
made by Farrakhan are relying on
secondary information and totally

abolishing the opportunity to obtain

firsthand information. Many people
feel it is making them appear to be
irrational, narrow-minded and rely-
ing on arguments which are heresay,
and unreceptive to anyjustiﬁcation
for allowing Farrakhan a platform.
They are the ones who make this a
black-Jewish issue.

“I feel enough has been said.
Futhermore, I am surprised that the
Jewish community took the issue to
the rhetorical height that they did,”
said Primus. “In fact, a couple of
years ago, Dr. William Stokely, a
devout racist was invited to speak at
the university at the expense of the
black student activity fee. We simply

went and listened to his racist allega- _

tions and confronted him in
person.”

Primus, a native of Washington,
D.C., graduated in 1982 from Wil-
son High School. He grew up in a
violent section of Washington called
the “Shaw Community." His
mother, Ermine Primus, was a
strong influence in his decision to go
to college. —

“All of my friends are now either
in jail or dead. Only one of my
friends made it to college,” said

“Once we have realized these les-
sons, our responsibility is clear. We
must get out of the way of change.
No part of our tax dollars should
prevent progress. We have to give
change a chance,” said Lappe.

Lappe has visited Central Amer-
ica twice and said that no-one was
afraid to speak to her in Nicaragua.

“They are watching to see if Presi-
dent Ortega will keep the people in
his hearts," said Lappe. “One
woman told me that it’s like hiring a

In France, you don’t have to
attend class or do assignments, but if
you don’t pass your exams, you're in
trouble. In England, by the age of
I 1, your career and the type of edu-
cation you‘ll receive have already
been determined. In India, no mat-
ter what university you attend, ifyou
are a physics student, you'll be tak-
ing the same test.

Although students in America
may assume that the rest of the
world is educated in just the same
manner, this is far from the truth. A
survey of France, England, Africa
and India shows some startling dif-
ferences that may make some stu-
dent happy they are studying in the
United States and others wish that
they could go overseas.

“In France, the outlook of educa-
tion is very traditional, stemming
from the Middle Ages,” stated
Timothy VanScoyoc, a French
major at Penn State University.

“The system is much more com-
petitive. It is mostly exams and pass-

Three students tell ofeducation in foreign countries

ing them in order to proceed on to
the next level of schooling. The
exams are given to the student at an
early age to channelethem into a spe-
ciﬁc track of study," explained
VanScoyoc, a first-year graduate
student. “Because of this filtering,
only the best of students actually
make it to the college level.”

After a test taken before entering
un college, or the French equivalent
of the American junior high school,
the children are separated into
“tracks" or specific areas of study.

Upon the completion of 1e Lycee,
the student must take an exam called
1e baccalaureat to enter an institu-
tion of higher learning. The students
who do well are placed in a univer-
sity, the highest level which corre-
sponds to our liberal arts college.

The students who do not fare as
well on the test are sent to grandes
ecotes which are separate technical
schools for education, engineering
and medicine, among others. The
lower-level students go to school for
more blue-collar training.

The French begin the filtering
process at an early age, and those
who pass through are rewarded with
an education that is mostly paid for
by the government, which looks at it

as an investment in the future.

“French people consider the
American education to be very egal-
itarian; everybody is considered ca-
pable of attaining upper level
education,“ stated VanScoyoc.

The French campuses aren’t the
self-contained units that the Ameri-
can campuses tend to be. There is
more interaction with the commun-
ity. Students live in the same neigh-
borhood with _typical families and
shop in the same shops. There is no
catering to the student body.

“There is, however, more distance
.between the student and the profes-
sor. There is a physical distance —
the professor is up on the podium,
and the students are seated below.
Generally, the students wouldn’t
think of interrupting a professor‘s
lecture to ask questions. Individual-
ized teaching is undertaken by grad-
uate students," explained
VanScoyoc.

The British system is very similar
to that of the French. At the age of
I I, “A" level exams are taken. Ifthe

student places among the upper per— '

centage, the student’s curriculum is
structured for college studies. If the
student fails the “A” levels, then the
student is channeled to study for

more manual careers.

Again, there is a differentiation
between college and university.
“High school students take their-‘O‘
level examinations. If they do well
enough, then they are entered into a
university. If not, the next step is
college," said George Dempsje, who
studied primary education in Eng-
land in l98l and 1982. For those
who do poorly on their “O‘s," trade
school is the alternative. Those who
go to a university are definitely the
above average students. '

“The British,” according to
Dempse, “look down at the Ameri-
can system. Any English exchange
student at an American school will
have to ‘make up‘ for the time spent
at an American college back at their
British school."

“The sifting process occurs much
earlier in England. I don't feel that
this is good for the student. It places
too much pressure on the child. He
has to deal with the normal prob-
lems of adolescence and the pressure
to pass his exams in order to have a
successful future. This could possi-
bly stunt the growth of the student
both academically and personally,"
stated Dempsie.

“Our system makes the student

pa'g'e'"3'

more well-rounded. In England,
they don’t get to take a smidgen of
this or that. The student is locked
into a step-by-step track of speciali-
zation. This makes it impossible to

change majors over there" — an
option open to Americans,” stated
Dempsie.

African countries have developed’
a system of higher education that is
different from the American system.
“There are very few colleges on the
African continent, making it diffi-
cult to enter college. Only about one
percent of all high school graduates

make it to college. To get in, one‘

must do well on the national exam,"
explained Phillip Skergan, who
lived in Zaire, a country in central
Africa, for a year. '

Most African colleges are techni-
cally oriented. There are afew lib-
eral arts schools for languages. The
colleges tend to give a very in-depth
education, but often the programs
lack laboratory or hands-on
experience.

“Some students, depending on in
which African country they are
attending college, have their educa-
tion paid for by the government.
Others have to scrimp to go to
school,” said Skergan.

One Small Step

An important milestone in the development and utilization
of outer space was realized Friday with the announced creation
of a National Commission on Space. In announcing the com-
mission, President Reagan said its goal is to “devise an aggres-

sive civilian space agenda to carry America into the 21st I

century.”

If only a president had the foresight to establish this sort of
commission 10 years ago.

It’s an important development, and it makes wonderful
headlines. But if Mr. Reagan is serious about carrying America
into the 2 1st century, he would do well to put as much emphasis
on the space program as he does on defense.

Incredible billions of dollars are being wasted on cataclysmic

- instruments of destruction that we pray are never needed. The
MX “Peacekeeper” missile is a prime example. These billions
of dollars could be put to much better use in the space program.
The possible benefits to the economy and the tax base from the
industrialization and colonization of space are limitless. To the
betterment of all mankind, new drugs, special alloys and other
products now unimaginable could result.

But tragically, the space program is the poor stepchild of
congressional budget appropriations. Budget cut after budget
cut forced embarrassing delay after embarrassing delay in the
development of the space shuttle. It is quite probable that, if
not for the military applications of the shuttle, the American
people would still be waiting for its first launch.

In all likelihood, the U.S.S. R. fears the space shuttle as more
of a threat to Soviet security than the MX. A vigorous and
vibrant utilization of space would do more to enhance the
security of the United States than 100 MX missiles. V

If the National Commission on Space is as useful to the
development of space as the Grace Commission was for the
budget, then the development of space is in serious trouble.

The space program will carry America into the 21st century.
The only place more weapons like the MX can carry America is
back to the dark ages.

Letters to the Editor

From the president

For the past few weeks, we have
been dealing with yet another very
serious issue, that is, the Reagan
administration’s proposal of mas-
sive student aid cuts. What this
entails is that students whose par-
ents make over $32,500 annually will
be eligible for no aid whatsoever,
regardless of how many other family
members are in college. Students
whose parents make between
$25,000 and $32,500 will be restrict-
ed to receiving $4,000 from all sour-
ces and will not be eligible for any
Pell Grants. Since it costs the aver-
age student $9,000 to attend this uni-
versity, a student within this bracket
would only receive enough aid to
cover less than half of the total cost.

In addition, this proposal would dis-
courage banks from distributing stu-
dent loans,» so, in fact, we are all
affected.

So what can we do about it? The
only way that we, as students, can
have any type of inﬂuence in this
decision is by writing a letter to our
district congressman. The 10 min-
utes you set aside for this task can
make the difference.’

On April 2 and 3, Student
Government will be distributing spe-
cial letter-writing kits. What this
includes is a list of congressmen and
their addresses, a cover leter
explaining how to write an effective
letter to your congressman, and also
a plain business envelope. .

All we ask is that you “help us help
you.” All you have to do is take the
10 minutes to write the letter. It

doesn’t have to be long and it doesn’t
even have to be typed. Just explain
how these cuts will affect you per-
sonally. You see, it is very important
that they receive many letters stating
individual circumstances. The only
other thing you have to do is place
the letter in the envelope and put
your Congressman’s address on the
front of it. If you wish, you can mail
it yourself, or just drop it off at the
Student Government Office, 639
William Pitt Union. We will be more
than happy to send it for you.

Again, I can’t express enoughhow
important it is that we all partici-
pate. Just take the time because
together we can make the difference.

Luke J. Kluchko
SGB President

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

Please, no G.I. jokes, this is
pretty serious stuff.

At the behest ofthe education
secretary, Congress has added
another committee to its spate of
investigatory bodies. Called
HICK ~ House Interest Con-
cerning Killjoy — its blue-ribbon
panelists are charged with
inquiring into recent forays
reportedly backed by the

Pentagon. i
This is what has William Ben-
nett so perturbed. You

remember him. He’s President
Reagan’s recent Cabinet appoin-
tee, the eminent scholar who's
been equating reductions in stu-
dent loans with languid days at
the beach and summer vacations.

Anyway, he's been off that
kick for a while, but apparently
continues to do exactly the oppo-
site of what he is supposed to do.
Unnerved, Bennett pressed for
HICK after becoming suspicious
of Pentagon involvement in two
public schools.

Two weeks ago in Mercer
County, the principal of James-
town High School evacuated the
students, sounding a nuclear war
alarm after learning the Soviets
just launched one of their
Armageddon projectiles. Every-
one was scared except, that is,
the principal. He said it was all in
jest, just a test. ‘

Funny guy. ,

Even earlier than this comic
fatalism, reports from San Fran-

_,cisco indicate two rifle-wielding

, policemen entered a classroom
of fifth-graders March l3. The

, teacher and 33 pupils were
ordered to leave in order that the
two comrades could use the set-
ting as a stakeout point.

This prompted mayor-elect
Diane Feinstein to demand a
written report of the exercise.
Bennett saw Pentagon subver-
sion, so he'll stick by whatever
findings HICK digs up. In fact,
HICK is even looking into that
TV commercial WANG is cur-
rently sponsoring. The high-tech
corporation has been employing
a suped-up Sikorsky gunship, of
“Blue Thunder" fame, in efforts
at “gunning for IBM” and its
hold on the personal computer
market.

It's easy to see that HICK has
its, hands full. It has scheduled
hearings to include both WANG
and the San Francisco Police
Department. Lately, HICK has
been hearing testimony on the
Jamestown incident. Already
appearing have been distraught
parents, livid students, the ingen-
ious principal and a host ofother
civic-minded residents.

Several days ago, feeling the
heat, the Pentagon sent one ofits
own men, an assistant deputy
undersecretary to the public rela-
tions aide to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. We alone HICK, discov-
ered a new twist behind the
incident.

Maybe Bennett was partly cor-
rect, as the economically minded
Pentagon people sent their latest

' mobile fallout shelter to Mercer
County. Instead of looking for
the nearest fallout shelter, stu-
dents were told to bolt for this
mammoth structure sitting on
earthmover wheels. o

It really is a nifty model. They
call it the FORD — Fallout Or
Radiation Deterrent. We don’t

. know too much about it since we
are talking about the Pentagon.

The Pentagon’s new pet project

Then again, those lowest on the
military totem pole never were
noted for their keenness of mind.
And this assistant deputy some-
body didn’t have his wits about
him.

His was one of the more inter-
esting stories HICK heard. Not
only can FORD do 55 m.p.h. on
the interstate, but it far outdis-
tances the outdated fallout shel-
ter. Now, when the big one hits,
we won't be faced with crusty sal-
tine crackers or hermetically-
sealed ‘ vials of water or even
listening to someone else’s
problems.

FORD has it all. For the
young ones, there are plenty of
Cabbage Patch dolls and animal
crackers. And ifthey start fidget-
ing, a Sesame Street tape can be
plugged into one of several avail-
able VCRS.

Many more amenities are pro-
vided. There are personal stereos
for your listening pleasure. fully
stocked (though cash) bars to
calm you down, unlimited
library selections to divert your
attention from other pressing
matters at hand and various
entrees from your favorite fast-
food enterprise to satiate any
unforeseen appetites. And if you
cajole a relief worker enough,
you can finagle a waterbed for
your nightmare pleasures;

So far, that’s about all that is
known about FORD. HICK is
definitely interested in more and
has scheduled future sessions.
Right now, everyone‘s on edge
while awaiting the big disclosure:
FORD‘s price tag for
production.

400 handicapped attend Hand-in-HandFestival

By Tess Warner
The Pitt News

The seventh annual Hand-in-
Hand Festival was held this past
Saturday on the first floor of
Forbes Quadrangle. Four
hundred mentally and physically
handicapped children partici-
pated in the festival. Each child
had a Pitt student as his friend
for the day. These student one-
on-one volunteers were special
people who were there to show
the children around, to help
them and, most importantly, to
care. '

Above the small stage hung a
banner. It proclaimed the theme
of the event, that “Friends make
life more bearable."

One of the festivals most

poignant moments was whenthe
sign-language performing group
Beautifu_l Hands was signing on
stage to the song “We Are The
World” by USA for Africa. Julie,
a Pitt volunteer, said, “You
know, that is what it’s all about
— lending a helping hand. It
really brings it home doesn't it?”

Although there were many
exciting shows and personalities,
the real stars were the children.
Everywhere you turned there
were children doing ‘things.
There were about 40 game
booths where children were able
to win goldﬁsh, have their faces
painted, get their pictures taken
and many other things.

If things got a little too excit-
ing there were quiet rooms on the
second floor and stage shows to
watch. Some of the crowd pleas-
ers were the City Theater group,

the Pitt Cheerleaders and Break-
through, which taught the
audience sign language. The Pitt
Panther, the Pirate Parrot and
Gumby were also on hand.

All of the activities and events
combined to make a wonderful
day for the children.‘But behind
all the balloons and colorful
games was a lot of hard work
that made the day possible. Plan-
ning for the event, which began
eight months ago, took long
hours and hundreds of
volunteers.

The coordinators for the festi-
val were Alan Martello and Rita
Silvestri. Sharon A. Goedert,
Bernie Koperek and Mary Ann
Wharton served as advisors for
the festival. In addition, there
were hundreds of others who
donated their time, money and
services.

Stennett juggles diamond , gridiron

While most of us are ﬁnding time
to relax and catch a few rays, sopho-

between Bobby Lewis’ baseball
practices and Foge Fazio’s spring
football drills. “It's hard. I can’t give
as much time to each sport as I
would like,” replied Stennett in a
recent conversation.

Stennett, a communications
major who is a starting outfielder
and a ﬂanker for the football team,
doesn’t find much conﬂict between
academics and athletics. This rare
two-sport varsity player finds time
to juggle all three. A single day con-

sists of running between the baseball
diamond and the gridiron. In the
evenings, he attends class and stu-
dies. “I find time in the evening to
study; you just have to make time,”
he said.
_ Stennett has been playing base-
ball since he was eight, and is cur-
rently a starter for the Panthers.
“The team looks good. We did
pretty well against Florida State and
had a few chances to beat one of the
top teams in the country. We just
didn’t have all their experience.”

The team is presently looking for-
ward to the challenge of competing
in the Big East for their first time this
season. They are also excited and
feel that they can compete and even-
tually receive a college playoff berth.
‘‘I don't know what the other teams
look like because this will be our first
year in the section and we have yet to

_.-te against these teams. I am
looking forward to a good season
and feel the team will be competi-
tive,” said Stennett.

Stennett is also attending as many
spring drills as he possibly canl “I am
a little tired in the evening," replied
Stennett, who is from Shaler High
where he attained All-America sta-
tus, “but I ﬁnd time to squeeze it all
in." Stennett has been playing foot-
ball since high school and recognizes
Jerry Matulevic, his high school
coach in both sports, as a major
influence on him.

“I am looking forward to a good
football season. I hope I can stay
healthy and that baseball doesn’t
hurt my chances of starting," said
Stennett.

As to what sport he prefers, Sten-
nett replied, “It depends on what
sport I am playing at the time.”

The East Suburban chapter of
the Pitt Golden Panthers
announced the winners of the
Proud Panther Awards for I984
last night at their awards ban-
quet. Tom Horew received the
honor for his performance on the
Pitt baseball team, Ulana Kohu-
tiak earned hers through
her accomplishments on the Pitt
volleyball team, and Caesar
Aldisert was selected to receive
the award from the football
team.

The awardees were decided
upon by the Golden Panthers
and votes fromcoaches for one
athlete from either the football
or the men’s basketball team, one
from the non-revenue men’s
teams and one from the women's

teams. ‘
Kohutiak, who recorded the
most kills (40) in a single match
for the entire NCAA Division I
schools, was surprised at her
selection. “I don't know if I can
deal with that,” she said. “I was
pretty shocked — I didn’t expect
it. It’s so hard to believe. ldidn’t
think I deserved all the

attention.”

is not lacking in "team support and
ability. “We have very good coaches

and the team is together," said’

OSU‘s Tracey Long after her floor
routine.

With four events being conducted
simultaneously, the crowd at the
field house had trouble deciding
which event to focus their attention
on at any one time. One might
wonder how the gymnasts could
concentrate on their own events with
so much going on around them.
“Over the years of competing, you
just learn to block it out,” explained
Pitt’s Beth Waters, who finished
with a 34.5 in the all-around.
“You’re just in your own little
world.”

Pieters agreed saying, “You‘re
supposed to have total concentra-
tion on your event. There aren’t that
many distractions at all. You have to
concentrate on what you’re doing
and your skill."

Penn State‘s Pam Loree, who fin-
ished first in the all—around at
regionals last year, settled for the
second-place position with a 37.55 at
this year‘s competition.

The Outstanding Senior Gymnast
award went to Diane Carlin (34.45
all-around) of the University ofNew
Hampshire. Temple coach Jeff Bro-
zenberg received the Coach of The
Year award. The winner of the indi-
vidual all-around with a score of
35.85 was Wendy Burrier, a fresh-
man from Temple.

Mellix

PITTSBU RGH (U Pl) .

Funeral services were held this
past week, in Pittsburgh for
Ralph “Lefty" Mellix.

Mellix played for 43 seasons
with I2 teams in the old Negro
Leagues and was a former room-
mate of the legendary Satchel
Paige. Mellix was 88.

Mellix pitched in about l,50O
games and played first base in
hundreds of others until he
retired at the age of55 because he
didn’t make it to the major
leagues. But his son, Henry, says
he was not bitter. “He played for
the game. He was raised up play-
ing ball and that’s what he did."

remembered

During his career, Mellix
pitched at least nine no-hitters.
Once, he hurled six one-hitters in
a row. In one game he struck out
I3 consecutive batters, all on
swinging strikes.

Mellix came out of retirement
at age 73 to beat an all-star team
and was later inducted into the

Pennsylvania Sports Hall of
Fame.
Some of the teams Mellix

played for were the Homestead
Grays, the Pittsburgh Craw-
fords, the Brooklyn Brown
Dodgers. the Atlantic City Bach-
arachs and the Youngstlown
Brown Stars.

the all-around, but she emphasized
that her goal was to gain experience.

“I'm trying something new With
every event. lt’s mostly a fun event
for me,” she said. When the meet
was finished she said that she had
not made any mistakes with the new
parts of her routine.

For Wendy Burrier, an all-around
performer from Kent State, the pres-
sure to perform well was there. Bur-
rier finished with 35.85, while her
qualifying score was a 35.22. “I
didn’t get the scores I wanted on the
floors, but that's not under my con-
trol,” Burrier said. “I was scared
coming in, being the only represen-
tative of my school. I didn’t know
what to expect. Once I have the right
attitude, then I can do it. lt’s 99 per-
cent mental and I percent physical,”
she asserted. “You just think ‘I can
do it, I will do it,’ and then you do
it.”

Burrier and Pulsinelli did not
qualify for the NCAA national tour-

nament, but they have three more
years to try.

Sharon Mahler, a junior all-
around from Northeastern, also fell
on her first vault. She appeared to
roll over the apparatus, bumping her
head and tumbling to the mats on
the other side, but she stood up
quickly and raised her arms in the
event-ending salute; then she
laughed nervously. It had been
close, but she was OK.

Gymnastics, an individual,
expressive sport requiring a great
deal of strength and split-second
timing, is more dangerous than foot-
ball, according to Zando. “There are
more per capita injuries in gymnas-
tics than in football,” she said.

For Paula Stewart, gymnastics
has become a memory, indefinitely.
“I was thinking about the Garden
State Games this summer,” Stewart
said. “I thought if I were in good
enough shape, I would compete, but
I won’t have enough time to recuper-
ate now.”

Pirates’ 4-13 record not good for possible fans

By Jim Bruedmer
The Pitt News

When the Phillies beat the Pirates
6-5 yesterday, it put an end to a
rather unusual week for the team.
First, they showed their first signs of
life by putting together a three-game
winning streak including winning
their first TV game ofthe preseason,
‘then they lost consecutive games by
the humiliating scores of 18-3 and

1 10-3.

The Pirates’ record now stands at
an unpromising 4-13. As things now
stand, they cannot expect much
from the gate, as they have not given
reason for interest.

Much of the attention at training
camp this week has centered on
three pitchers who have been chang-
ing assignments since camp opened.
Rookie Mike Bielecki, Rod Scurry
and John Candelaria have been
playing “musical pitcher’s mound”
much to the dismay ofthe latter two.

It all began when Scurry's groin
injury kept him from working out
once spring training started to close
in on the calendar. His being out of
shape (self-confessed) has hindered
his performance on the mound this
spring. Since his lone great season of
1982 (an ERA of 1.74 in 76 appear-
ances) was years ago, the Pirates can
only be so patient in waiting for him
to regain that lost form.

So far this spring, Scurry has
compiled a 10.80 ERA with six
walks in six and two-thirds innings.
Those are not impressive numbers,
especially for a man who is now in
danger of losing his job.

In an,effo‘rt to fill Scurry’s relief
duties, Chuck Tanner has once
again began experimenting with
John Candelaria in the bullpen.
Candelaria, who has voiced a desire
to be traded before, says he now
wants to be traded more than ever.

Tanner says that the move comes
because of Scurry’s ineptitude, not
because of Candelaria’s. But consid-
ering that in his last appearance,

— Candelaria gave up 11 runs and 12

hits in five innings against a Tigers
team made up mostly of reserves and

minor-leaguers, one has to wonder.

His overall spring ERA of 10.64 isn’t
exactly helping his chances, either.

However, it must be considered
that when Tanner experimented
with Candelaria in the bullpen at the
end of last season, it proved success-
ful. During that time, the Candy
Man retired 17 of the 18 batters he
faced. When asked at that time if he
would mind a permanent switch, he
replied that he wouldn’t if his con-
tract were renegotiated. His incen-
tive clauses are based on his status as
a starting pitcher (number of starts,
innings pitched_, etc.).

Viewpoint

With this being brought up again,
Pirates executive vice president Pete
Peterson ;has said that if the change
were made permanently, the renego-
tiation would occur. But this time,
Candelaria has said that even if it
did, he still doesn‘t want to go to the
bullpen.

This move was further compli-
cated by the fact that Tanner “has
to” make room in the starting rota-
tion for rookie sensation Mike Bie-
lecki. Those in charge of Pirate
promotions are anxiously awaiting
Bielecki’s arrival in the Steel Town.
They feel that he is a potential gate
attraction, something the Pirates
have sorely lacked in recent years.
He is 6-3, weighs 200 pounds, is
handsome, single —- and can also

the minor league pitcher of the year.

His 15 victories tied for the league
lead, and his 143 strikeouts were
tops.

One major factor of his success
has been his development of a fork-
ball only two years ago. It is because
of this pitch that Tanner is so enthu-
siastic about bringing him north at
the beginning of the season.

. But no matter who is on the hill,
one thing is for sure. If the Pirates
don't start producing victories, there
won’t be any fans for whom to pro-
mote anything.

Ohio State wins

Pitt in fourth

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Women’s Northeast Regional
Gymnastics Championships, which
were held at Fitzgerald Field House
this weekend, were dominated by
Ohio State and Penn State. Pitt,
who entered the meet ranked fourth,
held that same standing at the end of
the regional competition. The final
team scores were Ohio State
(185.65), Penn State (185.05),
Bowling Green (l75.6), Pitt (175.4),
New Hampshire (l74.7) and Rhode
Island (172.1).

Fall ends

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The ice had reddened much of
Paula Stewart’s foot, but the blue
tinge of injury was still visible under-
neath. The five ‘words she said
encapsulated the frustration, the
leaden disappointment of opportu-
nity that was crushed before it even
had a chance to blossom: “This was
my last meet.” Eyeing the colorful
activity that continued, she sat on

the sidelines, no longer a
participant.
Stewart was the lone senior

among six gymnasts who had quali-
fied for the all-around competition
in the NCAA Northeast Regional
Championships as individuals and
not with a team. She hails from
Roseland, N.J., and attends Temple
University. Her average all-around
score of 36.1 I was the highest of the
six unattached athletes.

 

Press Box

Not quite sparkling

The Pirates’ performance on the baseball
diamond needs to improve drastically if the
team expects to draw a crowd.

for the top spot as they maintained a
strong lead over the remaining com-
petitors. Although the Lady Lions
held a slight edge overthe Buckeyes
in three of the four events, the floor
exercise put OSU on top.

Ohio State coach Larry Cox was

especially pleased with his team’s

performance on the floor event, say-
ing, “I think this is the best meet so
far of their lives. If anybody beats us
in quality, they deserve to beat us
and they’re going to have to be
tough.” Ohio State will be represent-
ing the Northeast Region at the
national championship, which will
be held April 12-13 at the University
of Utah. “If we can do at least as well
as we did tonight, we'll do fine at

gymnast’s

Stewart’s first event was the vault,
where each performer is scored for
the better of two attempts. On the
first try, she fell. ,

“I hit it too low, and my hand

' slipped off the horse,” she said, dem-

onstrating by pushing her hand for-
ward through the air. “I didn’t have
any problems in warm-ups; I did
really well, actually.”

“It’s definitely sprained,” said Pitt
trainer Karen Zando after the fall.
“She’s going to the hospital to get it
X-rayed after the meet. It didn’t
seem bad enough to go right away,
so she’s staying to watch a teammate
of hers.”

/ That teammate was freshman Jill
Pusinelli, whose 35.00 all-around
average earned her a trip to the

regionalsand gave Temple the dis- .

tinction of being the only school to
send two gymnasts for the individual
qualifiers. Moments after Stewart’s
fall, Pulsinelli competed on the
vault.

“At first, it really bothered me,”
Pulsinelli said. “It wasn't exactly

night.

nationals,” said Cox after the meet.
“I think that if we can reduce some
of the missed sets that we had, we’ll
be in the top three.”

Penn State coach Judy Avener
was content with her team’s finish. “I
thought they were sensational,”
Avener said. “We only had one error
— one fall on the beam. I think we
did a great job.” 3 _

Pitt and Bowling Green battled
for third place, with the deciding
event being the evening’s final event,
the balance beam. Pitt beat Bowling
Green on the vault and bars but the
Falcons came back to steal the third-
place spot from the Lady Panthers
by outscoring them on the beam and
in the floor events.

nervousness. ljust felt really bad for
her.” .

Whereas Stewart had four years
of experience behind her, Pulsinelli
didn’t even have four months. ‘‘I’m
happy with my results,” she said
after the meet. “I only started in Jan-
uary — this is my first semester at
Temple after having a year off —
whereas everyone else started in
September.”

“We’re not having one of our best
, meets,” commented Pitt coach
Donna Sanft before the final event.
“Vaulting went pretty well, there
were some mistakes on floor and the
bars were OK. lt’ll probably come
down to Bowling Green and us for
third. We»haven’t come in lower
than third at regionals for five or six
years.”

Many of the Pitt gymnasts were
unsure of their individual and team
efforts at the meet. “I'm happy and
I'm not happy,” said Kristy Pieters
midway through the contest. ‘‘I’m
happy with my floor exercise (9.2)

and actually I’m happy with my,

vault (8.75) because it’s improved a
lot. But I’m not happy with my

  gymnastic championship

bars.” Pieters, with an overall score
of 36.10, went on to score a 9.2 on
the beam and was one offour people
to tie for fourth in that event. She
was the only member of Pitt's team
to individually place at regionals.

First place in the all-around went
to OSU’s Nina Dziem (37.7). “I was
ecstatic!” commented Dziem after
the awards ‘ceremony. “Five weeks
ago I had my knee operated on and it
was questionable whether I would
be here. I'm really proud of my job
and my team. Without the team I
wouldn’t have been able to do the
job.”

There’s little doubt that Ohio
