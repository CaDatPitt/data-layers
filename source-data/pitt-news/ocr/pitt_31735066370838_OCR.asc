Homecoming week is ideally sup-
posed to be a time of fun and excite-
ment, a time for the alumni to return
to their alrna mater and help the cur-
rent students cheer their football team
on to victory. It is a time for parades
and dances and the crowning of a king
and queen.

However, so far this year at Pitt the
spirit of Homecoming has yet to
surface.

“It’s different from high school
because not many people get in-
volved,” said Homecoming Queen
candidate Janine Disante. “I was disap-
pointed that not many people voted,
and I don’t think a lot of people will
get involved. That’s a shame.”

“This year 1 was excited because I
was a candidate,” said Michelle Bell,
another candidate. “But I’ve been here
for four years, and I think Homecom-
ing was more appreciated in the past.
I think students aren’t really aware of
Homecoming.” ,

These sentiments are not only
voiced by some of the candidates for
Homecoming but »also‘by The Pitt Pro-
gram Co1Ihcil’s Homecoming chairper-
son Daphne A. Lapointe.

“I think Homecoming should be a
week packed full of all kinds of pro-
gramming and events that appeal to the
wide variety of people and cultures that
comprise the university,” she said.

‘ ‘However, in previous years (not ex-‘

cluding the present) I feel Homecom-
ing Week has fallen short of this. The
only way a week like Homecoming can
be successfully accomplished is by hav-
ing a lot of the student organizatons on

Students plan apartheid protest,

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

An anti-apartheid protest will take
place Friday outside the William Pitt
Union from noon until 2 p.m. The pro-
test will be aimed at persuading Pitt’s
board of trustees to divest university
funds from companies doing business

in South Africa.

The armouncement was made Mon-
day at a press conference held by
Students for a Free South Africa, a
newly formed student organization.

“We’re expecting at least 12 student
organizations to lend their support to
the rally,” said Doug Howell, a
member of Students for a Free South
Africa. -

The rally will coincide with the
U.N.-coordinated National Anti-
apartheid Protest Day. Demonstrations
are expected to be held on college cam-
puses nationwide, ‘aimed at persuading
university administrations to divest
funds from companies doing business
in South Africa. The protests will also
focus on the political prisoners being
held in South Africa.

Chuck P__asC‘c_11,. co-chairman of the
Pitt Divestment Campaign, explaining
why he feels Pitt should divest, said,

campus sponsor events of their own,
in addition to the traditional events.

“I_ feel we did a good job this year.
We tried to implement many new
ideas, and I had an excellent commit-
tee that really cared about the univer-
sity,” Lapointe said. “However, I feel
I can speak for my committee when I
say that we would really like to see
more widespread university enthusiasm
and involvement, as well as more
alumni involvement. After all,
Homecoming really is a week for the
alumni to come back to school and
celebrate with. the students. ’ ’

Participation is also lacking at the
Homecoming football game this Satur-
day against North Carolina State. So
far, only 35,000 tickets have been sold,
and a crowd of only 36,000 to 38,000
is expected.

“There’s far less morale than there
used to be,” said Homecoming Queen

Pitt plans national research center

By Kathy Campbell
Staff Writer

Pitt's School of Medicine has now
become a national Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center. This follows the ac-
ceptance of a grant awarded Monday
from the National Institute of Aging.
The $7 million grant was the largest of
ﬁve grants awarded this year to study
Alzheimer’s disease. The ADRC will
build upon the clinical and research
sevices already in place by the univer-
sity’s Alzheimer’s Program, which was
funded by the NIA in 1983.

Among the major goals of Pitts-

,5 burgh’s ADRC are to determine

biological, neurochemical, molecular
and behavioral markers of the disease
so that a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s can
be made while the patient is still alive.
The research center will also provide
clinical services to patients and families
or caregivers based on the center's

most recent research advances. The
center will be headed by Francois
Boller, M.D., Ph.D., of the universi-
ty’s School of Medicine. ,

The ARDC will begin its clinical and
research services in December. Among
the projects that are included within the
program are:

- NMR studies of brain aging in
Alzheimer’s disease, which will study
the different metabolic patterns that ex-
ist in the brain using nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. This will be
the only center to make use of such
technology.

- Cell membrane correlates in
Alzheimer’s disease, which will in-
vestigate the molecular biology of cell
membranes in the brain and the platelet
and red blood cells in Alzheimer
patients.

- Cerebrospinal ﬂuid and brain en-

zymes in Alzheimer’s disease, which.

 with $7 million Alzheimer’s grant

will determine the relationship between
various neurochemical measures and
cognitive ability of Alzheimer patients.
- Communication in Alzheimer’s
disease and depression in aging.

- Attention deﬁcit in patients with
Alzheimer's disease.

The ADRC will be located at Falk
Clinic where the referral, evaluation,
diagnosis and care of patients will take
place. Assisting with the program will
be the'Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, Presbyterian-University
Hospital, the Veteran's Administration
Hospital on Highland Drive and the
NMR Institute.

The center will study about 1,000
elderly people as a part of these pro-
jects. The ADRC plans to beneﬁt from
the help of normal, healthy elderly

volunteers as well, so scientists can

compare their tissues and behavior to
those of -Alzheimer victims.

attack Board investment policy

“It ’s time for the trustees to stop hiding their titles
and do something about apartheid. ”

— Rashid Soundiata,
chairman to the BAS
Political Action Comm.

“I think the university should have a
conscience concerning who they ad-
vocate. They [Pitt’s board of trustees]
don’t support apartheid; they support
proﬁt.”

Pitt has approximately $37 million
invested in these companies, according

I to Pascal.

Pitt’s administration supports a

‘policy of selective investment in which

investments are made only in com-
panies following the Sullivan Prin-
ciples, which are guidelines for fair
employment practices. By 1980, 140
out of the 300 U.S. companies
operating in South Africa had endorsed
the Sullivan Principles, according to a
report issued in 1981 by the Africa
Fund.

The Sullivan Principles have been
criticized because the plan has no
speciﬁc demand for black political

candidate Julie Gress, “and people.
think that since they are at a big univer-
sity they shouldn’t get involved — I
think a lot more participation is need-
w. 7 9

’ Despite the lack of excitement and
participation, Homecoming will still go
on, and the tradition it inspires still con-
tinues in some. ‘

“It’s the best time of the year for -

alumni,” said Homecoming King can-
didate Jason _Shollenberger. “It is
highlighted by the voting and nomina-
tion of the king and queen and gives
all the students a chance to participate
in the university.

“I don’t think Homecoming has real-
ly lost anything,” he said. “It’s just
been adjusted to ﬁt the changing at-
titudes of the student population.”

“It’s really big to me because I have
a lot of relatives that went to Pitt, and
we always have an exciting time with

rights, no commitment to negotiate
with black trade unions and no demand
for their recognition by the South
African government.

‘ ‘It’s been basically accepted by most
authorities‘ that the Sullivan Principles
don’t work,” Howell said.

There will be ﬁve speakers at the
demonstration on Friday: Joe Moabe,
a representative of the Pan African
Congress; Barbara Sizemore, from
Pitt's Department of Black Studies; and
Rashid Soundiata, chairman to the
Black Action Society’s Political Action
Committee. Chuck Pascal and Doug
Howell will also speak.

“As of now, students really haven’t
had any control on how their money is
being spent,” said Soundiata. “It's
time for the trustees to stop hiding their

titles and do something about apar- ‘

theid. ’ ’

Student apathy puts damper on Homecoming

the tailgates and parades,” said
Homecoming Queen candidate Paige
Allen. “I think it’s just a great time for
the alumni and everybody.

“People aren’t quite as involved as.
they used to be,” she said. “But I don’t
think Homecoming has lost anything,
and I think it’s still special.”

Other candidates agree.

“It’s an expressive event for all the ,

students,” said Bell, “and a way for
the students to show school spirit.”
‘.‘It’s.a great way to represent the
umversrty and the student body, ’ ’ said
Gress. “It’s a way to get involved, and
it makes for a great football game.”
_ “I think it’s a time when students can
get together and show their pride,”

. said candidate Susan Block. “It’s a
celebration of being in college — fall ,

festival that has the name of Homecom-
in .’ ’

A group of Pitt faculty and students
has begun raising money to help build
new housing for earthquake victims in
Mexico City.

For the next three days, students will
be collecting donations at designated
areas in the Cathedral of Learning,
Forbes Quad and the William Pitt
Union. The money collected will be
given to the American Red Cross
which, in turn, will pass the money on
to the Society of Friends. A group from
the society is involved with several
construction projects in the devastated
City.

Dr. Jose Moreno, a sociologynﬁpro-

Pitt group seeks funds
for earthquake victims

_ formed because “we were all very im-

fessor at Pitt, said the Pitt group was

pressed with the disaster in Mexico.’ ’
He added that it is time the university
does something about it. ‘ ‘That’s what
motivated me.”

Dr. Diana Velez of Pitt's Depart-
ment of Latin American Studies said
she helped organized the fund drive
because “Mexico’s crisis is really on-
ly beginning. Now, we are dealing with
thousands of homeless.”

.Velez said the group hopes to gather

only merely as much as people ‘are will-
ing to give. ‘ ‘We are depending solely
on the good will of the people,” she
said. -
Donations will be placed in a tem-
porary account at Pitt. Checks can be
made out to the Pitt-Mexican Relief
Fund. '

Water on Mars?

(California) — A group of scientists

I says there is water on Mars.

That, they say, is important because

Mars is probably the solar system’s

best candidate for human colonization ,

and exploration. Although scientists
have theorized about the possibility of
water on Mars, there have been doubts.

A group of scientists from NASA
met at the Water On Mars Workshop
in Mountain View, Calif., to discuss
the climate and environment on Mars.
They’re looking at data gathered from
orbiters.

According to the space agency
researchers, Mars is so cold that water
would stay frozen except for a brief
period during midsummer days at the
Equator. The atmosphere is too thin to
effectively retain heat, but scientists say
that the evidence shows that buried
underneath polar caps of dry ice is ice
from water.

Senate seeks
credit limit rise

(WASHINGTON) — The govem-
ment continues to face the prospect of
empty pockets as the Senate edges
toward a deal on raising the federal
credit limit.

Senate Republican leader Robert
Dole is now offering to go along with
a short-term extension of the federal
debt ceiling — in return for a vote later
this week on a measure that would re-
quire a balanced federal budget by
1991..

Opponents of the balanced budget
measure, proposed as an amendment
to the debt-ceiling bill, started a
filibuster ﬁve days ago. _

The U.S. Treasury says it can cover
today’s bills, but the cash is likely to
run out tomorrow unless Congress
authorizes a higher federal debt.

‘Phoenix wins PPC band battle, 0
walks away with $300 in prize money

By Michelle Kiraly
- For The "Pitt News

Who is the best band on campus?
Phoenix, a Top-40 dance band, was
chosen by approximately 400 students
as the winner of the “Battle of the
Bands” competition Monday evening.

“We’re very pleased. It was a great

program and we had a good crowd,”
said Darla Twale of the Pitt Program-
Council, which sponsored the
Homecoming Week event.

Phoenix received $350 for ﬁrst place
while another band, ATS, won the
$200 second-place prize.

Twale explained that with the‘

Homecoming theme of “Pittsburgh -
Our Kind of Town,” it was only sen-
sible to have bands from Pitt in the
contest. '

Pitt Program Council advertised for
student bands to submit demo tapes for
the contest. ATS and Phoenix were
chosen as the two competitors.

“It was convenient for staging pur-
poses to have two bands competing in
the Assembly Room (of the William
Pitt Union),’ ’ entertainment chairman
Carrie Collins said.

Both bands played nine selections
each, and students voted by applause
for their favorite band at the end of the
program.

“I haven’t been to a battle of the
bands before, and this is great,”
freshman Patty Charley said. Junior
John Dent added that the contest was
a great way to kick off Homecoming.

‘ ‘We started playing in seventh grade
and began building our sound and in-
vesting in equipment,” said Phoenix
member Mike Meddock. Meddock,
along with band members Todd
Tusick, Bob Mashensic and Tim
Schoeneweis, said they entered the
competition because they wanted to
play for a college crowd and have a
chance to win the prize money. Med-
dock, the only Pitt student in the band,
said Phoenix usually performs at clubs

Dave Hooker/ The Pitt New-

The band ‘Phoenix’ performs during Battle of the Bands com-
petition. A total of two groups competed for the 5300 award.

in Beaver County and in Ohio. The
other band members attend area
colleges.

Phoenix plans to use the prize money
to purchase new equipment for the
band. . _ _

When ATS band member Josh Am-
son was asked what the letters ATS
stand for, he jokingly said, “It could
mean All The Songs, but it depends on
when you ask.” The four-member

band met while working at Second
Mile Light Hauling, a moving com-
pany in Oakland. They wanted to play
music sothey formed ATS.

The band has been together since
June and are all Pitt students. Arnson
describes their music as “post—
industrial, country/western pop.’ ’

ATS, which wrote all the songs they
performed, plans to use the prize
money to make a demo tape.

Opinion

    Protest Urged  

On Friday, Oct. 11. several demonstrations are scheduled

to take place in front of the William Pitt Union protesting
' the University of Pittsburgh’s investments in American ﬁrms
that do business in South Africa. The ﬁrst of these demonstra-
tions will be held between the hours of 12 noon and 1:30
p.m., while the second is to occur between, 4 and 6 p.m.

Remember: Under apartheid, black South Africans are
forced to endure great hardships, indignities and depriva-
tions and are robbed of even the most basic human rights.
Can we, in good conscience, continue to allow university
money to directly or indirectly beneﬁt a regime that
perpetrates the kinds of evils that the South African govem-
ment is responsible for without voicing our disapproval and

even our disgust?

The editorial staff of The Pitt News encourages students
to participate in these demonstrations. From a moral stand-
point, it is imperative that Pitt students put pressure on the
university’s board of trustees to choose divestment as a form

of protest against South Africa’s racial policies.

We urge Pitt students to demonstrate solidarity in support
of black South Africans. We hope that Pitt students will act
in common to inﬂuence the University of Pittsburgh to divest
and thereby join Columbia University and a growing list of

other colleges and institutions in doing so.

Injustice

Apparently, the university’s board of
trustees is insensitive to the suffering
of my brothers and sisters in South
Africa and place proﬁt above freedom.
Let’s take the proﬁt out of apartheid
and help end the tragic and cruel in-
justices being practiced in South
Africa.

Let’s analyze some of the many in-
justices practiced in South Africa. For.
instance, black miners work three miles
underground and take all the risk while
white coal miners work higher above
and earn 16itimes more for the same
work. Also, the black miners average
three deaths per shift while white South
Africans get richer and richer. White
South Africans enjoy the highest stan-
dard of living in the world while black
South Africans suffer poverty and
hunger. As one white South African.0f-
ficial put it, “No black will ever hold
a job higher than a white. Blacks are
only in South Africa to sell their
labor.”

Blacks pay for their education, while
whites don’t. Under present South
African policies, black workers can’t
live with their families because blacks
that work in the city have to live out-
side the city, and there is only limited
single-sex labor camps available. The
men and women in these labor camps
only get to see their families once a
month. To me there is just no legitimate
justiﬁcation for the separation of a
family.

As I write the ﬁnal words to this ar-
ticle, the tears roll down my face for
my brothers and sisters who have died
for a simple concept called freedom.
When this is all over and we who stand
against the injustices of apartheid have
won, those of you who stood in our
way will be held accountable and will
suffer the embarrassment and criticism
you so rightfully deserve.

Attack Debated

In Zachary Grayson’s Oct. 7 letter

i, to the editor, he states that he was

“shamed” by the Pitt News editorial
of Oct. 4 critizing the Israeli bombing
of P.L.O. headquarters in Tunis,
Tunisia. In that editorial, it was stated
that “it’s time that U.S. decision-
makers heed their consciences and stop
allowing a very small but powerful lob-
by group to dictate U.S. policy in the
Middle East.”

Mr. Grayson takes this to mean that
the Pitt News editorial board is asser-
ting that “the Jews control the U.S.
govemment.” Regardless of the validi-
ty of the editorial board's statement, the

interpretation given by Mr. Grayson is V

unsubstantiated.

Rather than suggesting that the U.S.
government is controlled by Jews, the
editorial board merely states that U.S.
policy in one area (the Middle East) is

would have been more appropriate) by
a small, powerful lobby group. The im-
pact of special interest groups on U.S.
government policy is certainly not
limited to the Middle East (e.g., the
tobacco, oil and defense lobbies), nor
is it any great secret. So why has Mr.
Grayson chosen to misinterpret the
editorial as such? Why, rather than
discuss the issue of the pro-Israel lob-
by rationally and on its merits alone,
has Mr. Grayson chosen to resort to
such inﬂammatory rhetoric as sug-
gesting that the editorial board is either
“ignorant,” “anti-Sernitic” or “ir-
responsible? ’ ’

Mr. Grayson states that as a member
of the university community he feels
shamed by the editorial. In a universi-
ty community, we should be able to
discuss issues rationally, without re-
sorting to the kind of mud-slinging
employed by Mr. Grayson. It is this ac-
tion that is shameful and irresponsible,
not the opinion expressed by the Pitt
News editorial board.

Daryl Burrer
GSPIA

I must take exception to your Oct.
4 editorial, “PLO Bombed.”

Fifst, the accusation that Israel
failed to establish the culpability of the
PLO before the attack is untrue. Ian
Davison, one of the three assassins cap-
tured after the Cyprus attack on Yom
Kippur, is admittedly a member of
Arafat’s elite “Force 17” and was
among some 1,200 PLO terrorists
evacuated from Tripoli in 1983. While
the deaths of innocent civilians are
regrettable, blame for these deaths
should lie at the feet of the Tunisian
government for giving the PLO sanc-
tuary on Tunisian soil. Have you
forgotten that the PLO is a terrorist
organization whose stated aim is the
violent destruction of the state of Israel?
' More importantly, your allegation

that “U.S. decision-makers [allow] a

very small but powerful lobby group
to dictate U.S. policy in the Middle
East” is not only untrue but blatantly
anti-semitic. That is equivalent to say-
ing that America’s Jews, less than two
percent of the population, control
America’s foreign policy. This argu-
ment is similar to the ones made in
‘ ‘Protocols of the Elders of Zion, ’ ’ the
notorious czarist forgery which pur-
ported to be a Jewish plot for world
domination. Because a lie is big and old
does not make it true. Such an allega-
tion is beneath contempt, and I con-
demn the editorial board of The Pitt
News for lending credibility to this in-
sidious idea.

Additionally, you posit that Israel
threatens vital American interests in the
Middle East. This is simply an untruth.
For years, Israel has consistently
answered American calls for assistance
in the region. Their strength is a con-
stant deterrent to Soviet expansionist
policies in the Middle East. Israel pro-
vides our country with potential air and

naval  in event of an emergen-

 

cy as well as sharing important
discoveries in military technology with
the United States. Israel also stands
behind the United States on the inter-
national scene, voting with America in
the United Nations 90 percent of the
time.

The cost of all this to the United
States is approximately $2.5 billion a
year. This compares favorably to the
$40-odd billion that America spends to
prop up her NATO allies in Europe,
which buys us the ingratitude of such
countries as France," Holland and
Belgium. You have a gross

’ misunderstanding of whom America’s

allies really are. An editorial such as
this casts a shadow of doubt over the
fairness and integrity for which The Pitt
News supposedly strives.

I am writing in support of the Pitt
News editorial staff for their having the
e to state their convictions in the
Oct. 5 editorial on the P.L.O. head-
quarters bombing in Tunisia. It is un-
fortunate that an American citizen can-
not criticize the state of Israel for even
its most outrageous violations of inter-
national law and human decency
without being charged with anti-
Semitism. This unfortunate situation is
perpetuated by a mentality that-equates
any criticism of Israel, no matter how
justiﬁed, with anti-Semitism. Not on-
ly is criticism of Israel justiﬁed in this
case (the bombing of the P.L.O. head-
quarters in Tunisia) but also on
previous occasions, such as’ the brutal
invasion of Lebanon in which over
10,000 civilians were killed, including
many elderly, women and children.
The vicious assault on Beirut —— the use
of cluster bombs, phosphorous bombs
(similar to napalm), the deliberate bom-
bing of apartment buildings, hospitals
and schools, the cutting off of water
and food supplies and electricity —
displays the ruthless nature of an Israeli
government that regards Palestinians
(and Arabs in general) as “two-legged
cockroaches. ’ ’

 In Support Of South African People Of Color  

Speaking out of our varied and per-
sonal religious convictions and shared
experiences, we chaplains and campus
ministers call the University of Pitts-
burgh community to share the follow-
ing issue of conscience.

The white-controlled government of
the Republic of South Africa persists
in perpetuating the apartheid system
despite worldwide outrage from peo-
ple of conscience. This intolerable
violence, the systematic oppression of
people of color, has been further ex-
acerbated bv a govemment-sponsored
state of emergency instituted since Ju-
ly. Because '
of emergency, South African police
and military are now ofﬁcially permit-
ted to detain and imprison people
without the right of counsel or habeas
corpus. It has been recently revealed
that a majority of those imprisoned and
detained — men, women and children

’ — have been victims of severe abuse

Charges equating the editorial board
with Hitler, the KKK and white
supremacist groups are irresponsible,
reactionary and false. The government
of Israel supports the government of
South Africa and denies the Palestinian
population under its military occupa-
tion, their basic human rights. This is
a supremacist attitude.
Most importantly, it is the duty of all
Americans to respond to injustices

and torture by their captors.

We believe apartheid and the terror
perpetuated by the South African
government to be demonic and evil.
Therefore, we call upon our various
constituencies represented throughout
the Chaplains’ community and the en-
tire campus community at Pitt, to make
every effort to challenge the South
African government in ending apar-
theid and to provide freedom and
justice for all South African people of
color.

Therefore, in solidarity with our
brothers and sisters of color in South
Africa and in support of their inherent
rights of freedom, justice and human
dignity, we commit ourselves to ‘the
-following measure and encourage
others to join us in this effort
throughout October. '

1. FAST FOR JUSTICE IN SOUTH
AFRICA — Each of us will fast to

-----write for THE PITT NEWS.---—

demonstrate our opposition against
apartheid and in support of justice for
all people of color in South Africa. This
fast will take on a variety of forms,
depending on special considerations,
including health. Some of us will fast
for one meal; others will fast for a day

‘or several days. We encourage

students, faculty, administrators and
other Pitt personnel to join us in this
effort. We recommend ﬁrst consulting
your physician. -

2. PITT ANTI-APARTHEID PRO-
TEST ON OCT. 11 — Pitt Students for
a Free South Africa have scheduled a
demonstration to be held in front of the
William Pitt Union between noon and
1:30 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 11. Pitts-
burghers Against Apartheid have
scheduled a demonstration on the same

" day at the Union between 4 and 6 p.m.

We support these efforts as a way of
raising conscience, increasing par-

ticipatory support and united action and
in speciﬁcally challenging Pitt’s Board
of Trustees to withdraw any and all in-
vestments associated with companies
doing business with South Africa.

3. LETTER WRITING CAM-
PAIGN — We ask people to write let-
ters in support of divestment to the
Board of Trustees and President
Posvar. In addition, we ask that all peo-
ple write to their congressmen, Presi-
dent Reagan and South African officials
to express their disdain for apartheid
and demand an end to the state of
emergency and the torture of detainees.

4. SHOW YOUR SOLIDARITY
BY WEARING A BLACK RIBBO
ON YOUR LAPEL ‘ .

5. CONTRIBUTIONS — For each
meal that you miss because of the fast
you_ are encouraged to contribute the
equivalent to what you would have

spent on food or any set amount. This
money will be used to challenge apar-
theid through local organizing efforts,
and through the support of Armiesty In-
ternational for use in combatting the

_violence of apartheid in South Africa.

For The Pitt News

After many months of intensive
seminars, Pitt’s Career Seminar Series
concluded with success.

“We had the best attendance in years
this time,” said Nancy Jasiewicz, a stu-
dent coordinator for the career
seminars. “This year we geared the
publicity toward explaining the
seminars more so people wouldn’t
think of them as too formal or ex-
clusively for seniors, but rather very
infomial and for non-students as well.
I think this helped a lot. Many of the
representatives commented that they
were happy to see underclassmen there.

‘-‘The evening seminars for CGS

‘students went exceptionally well, also.

The College of General Studies offered
wonderful support. They even provid-
ed hospitality meals for the represen-
tatives. It worked out really well,”
Jasiewicz said.

Business, communications and in-
dustry representatives saw the largest
turnout. J asiewicz commented that it is
usually the case that representatives of

' Tbusiness careers receive the most

students’ attention.

The government, law andpublic ser-
vice seminar, however, drew a wider
reception this year than in previous
years. This year, representatives from
30 law schools attended the seminar

BL®M COUNTY

The Pitt News - October 9, 1985

Career Seminar Series a success

series. In previous series, the number
of representatives averaged 25.
Representatives from the Washington
Center, a non-proﬁt center which ar-
ranges student internships in
Washington, D.C. , were very pleased
with the amount of_ student interest.

Teddy Fakles, a counselor at the
Career Counseling Center, said the
names of big corporations usually draw
students. The purpose of inviting these
people, however, is not to represent
their companies or recruit future
employees, but to have them share their
own experiences in the working world
with the students, Fakles said.

Fakles said she believes “it’s very
important for the representatives to be
honest and frank rather than create a
glowing picture of their career.” At
this point in the game, she added,
students don’t need to be-misled about
the demands and motives within the
real job market.

Trends in career interests are large-
ly a result of the type and amount of
media attention given to certain ﬁelds,
admitted Fakles. Currently, marketing,
public relations and high-tech seem to

be the ﬁelds of the 1980s, according.

to the national media. Perhaps the
popularity of the business and com-
munications seminar is a reﬂection of
the truth and/or effectiveness of that
message, she said. '

‘A few years ago, employment agen-
cies and college administrators were

advocating specialization. Recently,
however, many ﬁrms seek individuals
with creativity and a weH-rounded
liberal arts background. Some sources
even claim that the most valuable asset
for a challenging career is a degree in
English literature.

In response to this apparent oscilla-
tion in demand, Fakles said, “Interests
seem to go in cycles. Specialization and
a weH-rounded liberal arts background
are simultaneously needed most of the
time. Liberal arts people perhaps need
to become more technically literate,
and technicians often need to be
literate, period. Realistically, the de-
mand lies somewhere in between.”

Fakles suggested that neither asset IS -’

necessarily better when excluded from
the other. She said she hopes that
students ﬁnd their own interests and
values as points of reference ﬁrst,
before seeing what is out in the job ,
market, rather than orient their educa-
tion toward a ﬁeld high in demand
without prior adequate self-exploration.

“The process of choosing a career, ’ ’
said Fakles, ‘ ‘should be an opening-up
experience, not one that is constantly
closing in and narrowing choices. We
want students to see, especially in their
freshman and sophomore years-, a
multiplicity of choices so that they
don’t develop tunnel vision. Career
development is a lifelong process and
‘a part of one’s total development.”

Apartheid:  

"By David Zafris
Staff Writer

' As the turmoil in South Africa con-
tinues to surface in the streets and col-
lege campuses of the United States, stu-
dent demands of university divestment
are growing in fervor, and the deci-
sions facing university administrations
are getting increasingly complicated.

This week at Pitt, the university’s
position on South African divestment
will be challenged for the ﬁrst time as
student protestors -ﬁll the lawns and
streets of the campus Friday, as part
of a national anti-apartheid protest
organized to dispute political prisoners
in South Africa and Pitt divestment
policies.

Presently Pitt has approximately $38
million invested indirectly in com-
panies doing business in South Africa,
according to Chuck Pascal, chairper-
son of the Pitt Divestment Program.

U.S. Steel, as‘of 1983, was the 16th-'

ranked U.S. corporation in South
Africa with investments totalling $34.5
million, according to the Paciﬁc North-
west Research Center.

If Pitt’s board of trustees should
divest funds from these companies,
they would risk losing important cor-
porate ties in Pittsburgh.

Pitt’s board of trustees have adopted
a policy of selective divestment, a
pohcy that allows investments to be
made only in companies ' to the
Sullivan Principles. Named after the
Rev. Leon Sullivan, these principles
single out companies that treat black
and white employees equally.

A dispute over the effects and validi-
ty of the principles, along with the con-
tinuing violence in South Africa, has
ignited protests on college campuses
nationwide.

The continuing unrest in South
Africa has stemmed from the govem-
ment’s decision to implement a new
constitution on Sept. 3, 1984. The con-
stitution gave veto power and total con-
trol over the 23 million blacks to the
4.5 million whites.

Since then over 700 people have
been killed in South Africa in riots and
demonstrations, most of them black.

“The university supports the
desirability of a strong American
presence in South Africa,” Executive
Vice President Jack Freeman said to
Die Pitt News last August. “I don’t
believe the [board of trustees] is likely

to re-open the position on divestment,

Pitt investments challenged w'th
pending student protest

‘ ‘Apartheid is constifutional racism. It states that blacks will have lower pay, worse
housing, and fewer opportunities than whites. It must be struck from legislation. ”

Doug Howell

Students for a Free South Africa

‘though obviously we will continue to
review the situation in South Africa.’ ’

The Student Government Board sub-
mitted a resolution to the board of
trustees last January, calling for total
divestment of university funds invested
in South Africa. The board refused the
request and reafﬁrmed their position
against divestment.

‘ ‘The Student Government Board is
continuing its support for university
divestment,” said Avery Abrams, an
SGB member. Abrams made the
presentation to the board, and he said
the SGB is still actively opposing the
board’s policy.

“Our governmental relations com-
mittee is lobbying in Harrisburg right
now,” he said Monday. “They are
aiming at passing legislation that would
require mandatory university divest-
ment in Pennsylvania,” he added.

The SGB has had some success at
reformin university policies toward
South ‘ca. Pitt trustees agreed to
pay an independent ﬁrm to observe
companies’ practices in South Africa,
making sure they adhere to the Sullivan
Principles.

The SGB has endorsed a proposal
calling for divestment that was submit-
ted by the Pitt Divestment Program.
“The SGB has endorsed the position,
and they have shown their support for
divestment,” said. Doug Howell, a
member of Students for a Free South
Africa, organizers of Friday’s
planned protest. Howell said the goal
of his organization mustn’t stop with
university divestment. He said reforms
in the apartheid government will not
sufﬁce and that destruction of the apar-
theid system is the only answer.

“Apartheid is constitutional
racism,” Howell said. “It states that
blacks will have lower pay, worse
housing and fewer opportunities than
whites. It must be struck from legisla-
tron.”

South African ofﬁcials have pointed
to government reforms such as letting
blacks into the apartheid legislative
process, but Howell rejects the validi-
ty of any government reforms.

“I think it’s a farce on [the South
African govemment’s] part. The black

representatives in government are
mostly stool pigeons,” Howell said.
“The South African government can
find groups within the masses to ﬁght
against one another to legitimize apar-
theid rule. They can still ﬁnd blacks to
ﬁght against blacks. But the vast ma-
jority of blacks are totally against apar-
theid, and they are being oppressed. ”
The Students for a Free South Africa
organization isn’t planning any civil
disobedience to persuade the board to
divest. “We’re not interested in giv-
ing any ammunition to the administra-
tion,” Howell said. “Any form of civil
disobedience would give the ad-
ministration an opportunity to de-
nounce our organization and our
cause.” '
Howell said they would like to use
a practical and methodical approach to
the protest. “I think if you have 1,000

Cornell uses

By Michael Ashford
The Pitt News

In comparison with the large-scale,
divestment-movement activity on carn-
puses all over the United States last
spring, some people feel today’s move-
ment has lost its signiﬁcance. But old-
time activists know that fall terms often

bring with them a lull in student en-.’

thusiasm for “causes" and, perhaps on
a comparatively smaller scale, activism
is continuing around the country.

Cornell University is one such cam-
pus. The university saw massive
demonstrations in support of divest-
ment last spring, characterized by a
highly organized, condensed "move-
ment today —- a movement of vehement
arrest-risking demonstrations by
students as well as faculty.

Last year Cornell demonstrators
established what became popularly
known as a shantytown -— a collection
of cardboard, metal and wood struc-
tures analogous to the towns in which
most South African blacks live —- out-

lawfully, .we can have a big impact,”
he said.

Pitt students have held no demonstra-
tions concerning apartheid on the Pitt
campus. Students have been more con-
cerned with attending classes than pro-
testing civil rights violations.

“I really don’t believe that students
could tolerate being apathetic if they
realized how blacks are being
persecuted in South Africa,” Howell
said. “We have to try to educate the
students about the extent of the
atrocities.”

The depressed Pittsburgh economy
may contribute to the apathetic condi-
tion of Pitt students. “The fear of
unemployement has been put into the
minds of students,” said Ginny
Hildebrand, a member of the Central

_American Mobilization Coalition.

“They seem to be more money-
oriented. They are very concerned

about building careers and getting a
well-paying job. Because of this, stu-
dent activism has declined. Students
don’t want to take chances. Students
have put their noses to the grindstone
because of this economic retreat.
Unemployment is like a dark cloud
hanging over them.”

Hildebrand said that students have
been discouraged by the lack of strong
leadership in protesting against apar-
theid. “But I think Pitt students will
ﬁnd that there will be better organiza-
tion in the anti-apartheid campaign,”
she said. “The mass protests have even
affected Ronald Reagan.” President
Reagan recently announced a plan of
economic sanctions against South
Africa.

“Even a small turnout of protestors
on Friday would be progress,”
Hildebrand said. “The protest can’t be
a failure, in my opinion, no matter how
many people show up.”

Pitt Executive Vice President Jack
Freeman said the students have a right
to protest board of trustees’ actions.
“The students have every right to pur-

sue [the protest]," he said. “Butlhave

no knowledge of any plans to revise our
policy in the near future.”

side their university’s administration
building. The shantytown served as a
center for pro-divestment literature and
organizing as well as a home for the
more ardent activists. -

After rescinding the activists’ permit
to continue the shantytown, the univer-
sity won a court order to remove the
structures on the grounds’ that the
demonstrators were trespassing. The
structures were then torn down on June
25 by workers under the protection of
university riot police.

In another incident, 1,100 protesters,
including 15 faculty members, were ar-
rested last spring for violating-univer-
sity codes at Cornell. On April 25, the
day of the largest demonstration, 361
protesters were arrested at one time.

Today the picture is in comparison
admittedly less grand. But the intensi-
ty of the issue has not abated. Instead,
the movement has ‘dwindled to a core
of devoted pro-divestment activists who
established a new strategy early in
September that appears to have had
growing success.

_The new strategy entails persistent

and'highly organized sit-ins at the
university administration building at

Cornell, the strategy being to keep the '

issue alive while preserving human
resources. Students and faculty have
gone to the administration building
almost every day since rnid-September
just as the 5 p.m. closing time ap-
proaches. Once inside the building, the
protesters wait for the dean of students
and campus police to armounce official
warnings that the protesters are
trespassing and will be arrested if they
remain after closing time.

The organizers call this strategy
“guerilla tactics,” apparently in
reference to the small group of pro-
testers, “gueril1as,” and their actions
focused on one aspect of the university.

After the second warning, all of the
protesters usually leave the building ex-
cept for two who have volunteered to
be arrested and are always prepared
with statements for the press. Thus far
over 31 students and five faculty
members have been arrested on
cr_iminal trespass charges.

Although the activity of the pro-
divestment activists has become
somewhat routinized (recent arrests

' have reportedly been accompanied by

musical satires of the process), the
movement has achieved its stated short-
terrn goals — the main objective of the
movement being to keep the apartheid
issue alive while at the same time
preserving depleted human V and
material resources.

Last week the demonstrators re-
ceived national coverage when Allison
Lurie, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist
at Comell’s English department, was

' arrested by campus police for trespass-

ing. Lurie is one among many faculty
members who have allied themselves
with the student actions.

Lurie’s statement for the press was
released upon her arreston Oct. 2.‘ ‘A
college that continues to invest in South
Africa today is like a merchant who has
his choice of customers but goes on
manufacturing sheets for the Ku Klux
Klan, with the excrﬁe that he himself

’19i8,5

is an equal-opportunity employer.”
Thus, the movement appears to be
gaining momentum despite the
routinization of activity. On Sept. 23
about 60 percent of the university facul-
ty voted to uphold last year’s resolu-
tion urging the board of trustees to
divest completely. .

This divestment vote gave the move-
ment at Cornell new legitimacy in light
of the fact that only a small group of

' active faculty members pushed the
resolution through last year.

The pro-divestment activities are
now beginning to expand as they gain
more attention. Last week the
organizers called for a public meeting
with the board of trustees to discuss the
university’s current investment
portfolio.

But the university is making its own
moves. In response to last year’s large-
scale demonstrations. Cornell President
‘Frank T. Rhodes has begun seeking
more authority in deciding individual
students’ fates should they violate

According to Student Assembly
spokesman Alan Dickan, Rhodes is

seeking personal authority in deciding
who will be punished for violations and
how they will be punished, thereby cir-
cumventing recognized practices of
assembly review and decision—making.
Essentially, according to Dickan,
Rhodes wants to unilaterally change the
university judicial system with the aim
to enhance his personal power.
Even if the board of trustees passes
an amendment at their meeting this
weekend, said Dickan, lower-level ad-
ministrators have already stated that
they will not comply. The proposal for
new codes relating to “the maintenance
of public order” has met with strong

opposition from almost all areas of the ’ .

 Student Activism:

By David Zafris
Staff Writer‘

- At Columbia University in New York
City, student protests led to an ad-
ministrative aimouncement Monday,
divesting all funds from South Africa.
- At the University of California at
Berkeley, over 11,000 students listened
to Bishop Desmond Tutu speak about
apartheid.

- At Rutgers University in New Jersey,

students held the longest demonstration .

against apartheid, a four-week sit-in at
the ‘campus administration building.

Student activism has ﬂared up on col-
lege campuses across the nation. Car-
ryiiigprotestsigiisaiidshounngsl ans
against oppression has led to over 248
million of university funds being
divested from companies doing
business in South Africa.

The mostrecentdivestrnent was an-
nounced Monday at Columbia Univer-
sity. Columbia’s board of trustees said
they will divest approximately $39
million within the next two years,
divesting all university funds from
companies dealing in South Africa.

The board’s decision was linked to
the students’ sit-in at Hamilton Hall,
the university administration building.
The students took over the facility and.
renaniedit “Mandela Hall” aﬁersouth
African political prisoner Nelson
Mandela.

Columbia became the ﬁrst Ivy
League school to divest funds from
South Africa. David Goldner, an
undergraduate at Columbia and a
member of the Coalition for a Free
South Africa, urges Pitt students to
become active. “The administration
had their chance to divest from South
Africa because of the morality in-
volved, but they had to wait until stu-
dent activism made them do it,” he
said.

Student activism has also been suc-
cessful at Rutgers University. Students

Campus demonstrations grow
as apartheid continues

“If the university is only interested in proﬁt, they might
as; well get involved in the drug trade. It ’s about as reputable

as the government in South Aﬁica. ”

Matt Baker
Committee for Justice

in South Africa
Penn State University

longest anti,-apartheid «demonstration
held on a U.S. college campus. The_
Rutgers board of governors was per-
suaded to schedule a review of their
policies, and the vote for total divest-
ment will be held on Oct. 18.

The largest campus protests nation-
wide have taken place at the Univer-
sity of California at Berkeley. The
University of California has approx-
imately $2.4 billion invested in com-
panies doing business in South Africa.

“I think our overall movement has
been successful,” said Howard
Pinderhughes, a member of the United
People of Color. The student protests
have led the university to set up a com-
mission to study possible divestment
and to report back in two years.

Pinderhughes is sympathetic to the
Pitt organizations attempting to acquire
support from students. “Organizing on
an urban campus is a lot more difﬁcult
than organizing in a community,” he
said. “Students go home after classes,
and they don’t want to come back to
the campus unless they have to.”

Berkeley held a boycott of classes
near the end of the last school year, and
it was very effective. ‘ ‘If we were go-
ing to boycott it would have to be 70
to 75 percent effective,” he said. “This
time of the year, the students haven’t
been persuaded enough, so it wouldn’t
be successful.”

a Free South Africa. Penn State
University also has planned events for
this coming Friday to coincide with the
United Nations-endorsed National
Anti-apartheid Protest Day. They will
have a number of speakers on campus,
focusing on educating the vast student
population.

Penn State has approximately 5.8
million invested in companies -doing
business in South Africa.

Matt Baker, an undergraduate on the
Committee for Justice in South
Aft-ica,feels that students should have
more say in Penn State policies. “It’s
not ademocracy,” he said. “The on-
ly way we can do something about
apartheid is to hold symbolic protests
aimed at divestment.

“If the university is only interested
in proﬁt,” he continued, “they might
as well get involved in the drug trade.
It’s about as reputable as the govern-
ment in South Africa.” .

Pitt will join the national protest
movement this Friday. A new student
organization, Students for a Free South
Africa, is calling for students to pro-
test university investments in South
Africa in front of the William Pitt
Union between noon and 2 p.m. The
main goal of the rally is to educate the
students about the situation in South
Africa. Doug Howell, the coordinator
of the protest, said, “I really don’t

The Pitt News - October_9, 1985

BAS leader promotes image through
constant student contact

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Hudson Primus, chairman of the
University of Pittsburgh’s Black Action
Society, is a busy man. There are
meetings to attend, images to uphold,
people to meet. But despite all the
demands on his time and person, he ac-
cepts his responsibilities happily.

“I love my position,” said Primus
with a smile. “I enjoy the chance to
come in and be able to talk to all the
students — I have no regrets.”

The Black Action Society is a student
organization that is recognized and‘sup-
ported by the university as the
representative body for black students
attending Pitt. The organization’s pro-
grams meet the political, cultural,
educational and social needs of its con-
stituency. It assists the university in its
efforts to provide a positive environ-
ment for minority students to exchange
ideas, enhance cultural involvement,
and create some entertainment. The
main issue the BAS is concerned with
now is the university’s faﬂure to divest
itself of holdings in those corporations
that operate in South Africa.

As chairman of the BAS, Primus has
many responsibilities. ‘ ‘I have to keep
a positive image of the Black Action
Society all the time,” he said. “And
I try to keep in touch with every black
student on campus.

“I also have to attend different
meetings, always going to meetings,
but my job is making sure the

guidelines that the university has out-
lined for this organization are upheld.
That is my main priority.”

As a boy, though, it appeared he
might never get the chance to perform
so many duties. Primus, 21, was born
in Saint Vincent, West Indies. The ar-
chipelago on the shores of the Carib-
bean is a far distance from Pittsburgh
—.— in both miles and in ideology.

‘ ‘Our culture is very disciplined and
there is a very strong family struc- /
ture,” said Primus. “And people aren't
as fortunate ﬁnancially as they are here
in the United States.”

Primus came to the United States in
1975 with his parents and sister, and
they settled in Washington, D.C. The
difference in cultures were apparent to
Primus even then.

“People are better off here,” he
said. “And there is a much greater
value placed on material gains.”

At first, Primus had difficulty ad-
justing to the new culture. “When I
came here my biggest problem was my
accent,” he said. “I also missed my
other family members, my grand-
mother and my cousins. I was only nine
years old and I had a hard time.”

Primus did adjust, however; and
graduated from Woodrow Wilson High
School. After that, it was time to
choose a college. “I enjoyed the inner-
city life and wanted to go to school in
a big city,” Primus said. “I came to

Pitt because it was the closest of the
schools I was considering to D.C.”

Once he started school at Pitt he

began to have second thoughts. ‘ ‘I was

homesick at first and I didn’t like the
school,” he said. “But once I got set-
tlﬁd in, I really enjoyed it, and I have
no regrets at all about coming here.”

Primus, a senior majoring in
business accounting, was voted chair-
man of the BAS last March. Since that
time, he has accomplished much.

“We’re still in the building stage and
we have a lot yet to do, ” said Primus.
‘ ‘But we have been able to mobilize the
student body, get people interested and
participating in the university, and
we’ve been able to motivate the
students into a more uniﬁed student
body.” '

_ Primus got involved in BAS outjof
impulse.

'“More or less, being black, it was
an automaﬁc thing to join the Black Ac-
tion Society,” he said. “I got
motivated to run for chairman by my
fraternity brothers and after listening
to Jesse Jackson talk when he came
here last year.”

_ The BAS, although it takes up a ma-
jority of his time, is not his only
interest.

“I’m very athletic,” said Primus.
“You name the sport and I’H play it.
I like to play rugby — tliat’s my home
country’s sport.”

Primus also enjoys music. “I play
the trumpet,” he said. “And I like all
kinds.of music: rock and roll, reggae,
jazz, blues. You name it.”

He also has a distinct opinion on the
hot topic of apartheid in South Africa.

“I think the entire Pittsburgh com-
munity is being betrayed by those com-

 

  ‘mus

panics that are not totally divesting
from those discriminating corpora-
tions,” he said. “And the only way to
resolve the problem in South Africa is
for the blacks to control their own
destiny and elect their own govem—
mental ofﬁcials. .

‘ ‘We must realize that the only way
this can be accomplished is through
civil war. The white minority will not
give up their control over the blacks,
and only way they can get the vote is
through violence.”

Primus must concern himself with

other issues at the moment, however.

After graduation, he hopes to go to law
school. “I’m in the process of apply-I
ing to six different law schools,” he
said. “And I hope to be accepted.
somewhere . ’ ’

After that?
“I hope to have a career as a cor-
porate lawyer,” he said. “And some-
day become an entrepreneur in cor-
porate law.”

Peace Corps

By Mark Kenny
Staff Writer

Sitting in front of the William Pitt
Union, Kris Martin doesn't appear to
be any different from other 20-year-old
college students. Wearing faded jeans,
basketball sneakers and a sleeveless

. denim jacket over a fraternity jersey,

Martin’s appearance is typical of most
of his fellow students at Pitt. There is
one thing that sets him apart, though.

Unlike many seniors anticipating
graduation in April, Maitin’s sights
aren’t set on a conventional position
within a company or corporation. He
is not an aspiring yuppie. Instead, Mar-
tin is considering a position as a Peace
Corps volunteer. .

“My parents were pretty bafﬂed as
to why I wanted to do it,” said Mar-
tin, a psychology major. “I don't
know. Maybe I'm looking‘ for a
challenge.”

Although Martin admits to agreeing
with the popular concept of the Peace
Corps’ ideology, “people helping peo-
ple,” he said that realistically he
doesn’t think he’ll change the world.

“A lot of my friends have this im-

recruiting representatives visit Pitt campus

‘ ‘A lot of my friends have this image (of a Peace Corps
volunteer) as a Joe bleeding heart. But that ’s not me. ’ ’

Kris Martin

Peace Corps Volunteer

age [of a Peace Corps volunteer] of a
‘Joe bleeding heart,’ but that’s not
me.”

Martin is one of three students cur-
rently scheduled for an interview with
Peace Corps representatives who will
be on campus on Oct. 8-10, according
to the university placement office.

This week's interviewing session is
one of two formal recruitment drives
that the Peace Corps conducts each fall
and spring term at Pitt. Last year’s
placement office records show that 14
students made the same decision as
Martin has this year and filled out the
10-page application package.

Applicants are asked about their
education, employment history and any
volunteer positions they have held
which might be beneﬁcial to them and
the Peace Corps. Eight character
references are required, and applicants

must also account for any legal or
security-related records which they
might have.

Besides these formal recruiting pro-
grams, the Peace Corps has a recruiter
on campus all year long who works
through the University Center for In-
ternational Studies. The Peace Corps
recruiter at Pitt is Lynn Cohen. She has
a master’s degree in education and is
a former Peace Corps volunteer who
worked in Liberia as a teacher. Cohen
said she normally receives from 30 to
40 applications each year from students
who are interested in becoming
volunteers. Of the 30 or 40 who apply,
she said that only 20 might be selected
to serve.

The reason for such selectivity within
the Peace Corps relates in part to the
‘ ‘Joe "bleeding heart” image of
volunteers which many people still

maintain. When the Peace Corps was

created in 1961, the volunteers were

variously described by political detrac-
tors as draft-dodgers and beatniks. The
average age of those volunteers was 23,
and more than half of them were “B.A.
generalists” — college graduates with
liberal arts backgrounds.

Today, the average age of a
volunteer is 28, and the number of
generalists within the Peace Corps has
fallen to between 16 and 18 percent.
This change over the years has
developed to a degree because of the
ability of the host countries to request
which type of volunteers can go to their
country. “The Peace Corps is in-
terested in quality as opposed to quan-
tity,” Cohen said. -

Today’s 5,000 volunteers represent a

a decrease by more than half since
1968, when there were 12,000

volunteers all over the world. But
Cohen said that the Peace Corps has a
need for volunteers with more
mathematical, scientific and health-
related backgrounds, and that the 5 
mark is just what the Peace Corps 1S
aiming for.

Despite its preference for the more
specialized volunteers, th€?eace Corps
still does take in its share of liberal arts
graduates. This is good news for Mar-

- tin who, despite his lack of specialized

experience, would like to work as a
counselor in Latin America.

“It’s kind of depressing to see_ all
those blank spaces on your applica-
tion,” he said. “But I’m hoping.”

If he is selected, Martin can expect
to spend nine weeks in trairnng for a
volunteer position. During that time,
Cohen said, attention is focused on
three areas: speciﬁc attention to a
volunteer’s main interest, cultural
training that exposes the volunteer to
the customs and values of the host
country and training in the language or
dialect spoken in the host country.

Volunteers receive living allowances
while they are serving in a host coun-
try. At the end of their two-year assign-
ment, they receive a readjustment
allowance of $4,200.

Tight end Clint Wilson will miss this Saturday’s game against North Carolina
State due to a sprained knee.

Injuries

Receiving

shallow

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

Last week against South Carolina the
Pitt offense ﬁnally got rolling and
scored 42 points. A big reason for the
outburst was a game plan that includ-
ed passing to the running backs and
tight ends which loosened up the
Gamecocks defense.

The North Carolina State defense
may dictatethesamekindofgameplan
when the two teams meet on Saturday
at 12:10. .“They surround the ball and
commit eight people up front,” said
head coach Foge Fazio, “so we have
to be very patient and throw the ball
and make some completions. We’ll
throw the ball to everybody to spread
it around a little bit."

Spreading it around a little bit usually
means throwing to the tight end posi-

,tion, which was in good hands last

week. Senior Clint Wilson, the starter,
sat out last year with a broken foot but
was expected to have a great year. He
was backed up by sophomore David
Shuck who caught two passes for 15
yards last week.

Unfortunately, Wilson went down
with a sprained right knee early in the
third quarter and is doubtful for Satur-
day. A few minutes later Dave Shuck
fractured his collarbone after making
a nifty grab along the sidelines. He will
be out for ﬁve games. The injuries
leave Pitt with ﬁfth-year senior Bob
Lawson and freshman David Tanczos.

 

Lawson is a 6-4, 225-lb senior from
Penn Hills High School. He was a
highly recruited wide receiver in high
school but was moved to tight end
because of his size. Tight end coach
John Montgomery has been trying to
get Lawson to become more aggres-
sive. “He thought I played like when
I was a 230-lb. wide receiver in high
school,” said Lawson. “He’s been try-
ingtostresscomingofftheballandbe-g
ing more physical.”

“Coach Montgomery likes perfec-_
tion, and he strives for it. Through that
I ﬁnd myself getting better because he
just pulls that out of us,’ ’ Lawson said.

The reason for the tight ends becom-
ing more involved in the Pitt offense
is due to new offensive coordinator

Chuck Stobart. When he arrived here
from Utah State last spring, he told the ‘

tight ends that they would see between

30 and 40 passes sail their way. So far ’
this year the Panther tight ends have »

caught 17 passes for 153 yards. In con-
trast, during last year’s 3-7-1 season,

the tight ends had 19 passes for 199

yards in all 11 games.

Since Stobart has employed a shorter
ball control offense, the tight ends
became a major weapon. “We’re look-

ing at 10 to 25 yards a pop when we ’

pass the ball,” said Lawson. “With
that, the tight end routes~are anywhere

from siir to 12 yar .”

Sometimes there is a hesitancy to go
to players who have not seen a lot of
playing time. The tight end delays and
crossing patterns were a big part of the
Panther offense when there was depth
at the position. But Lawson believes
that the tight ends will continue to be
part of the offense against North
Carolina State.

“Coach Stobart believes that if we
keep picking away underneath them,
the long patterns will open up for the
wide outs,” he said. “If it’s there, then
we have to take it, so I believe the tight
ends will continue to be a factor.”

Lawson has had an injury-plagued"

career at Pitt. He suffered a knee in-

jury in 1982 and was redshirted. Last -

year he had a pinched nerve in his neck
and missed most ofgtheg season. Now

Today’ s coaches are breeding characters, not building character

I could hear the deep, booming voice
of my coach from the parking lot out-
side the arena — ‘ ‘Move! Move! Come
on, Coles, you’re not skating!_ HUS-
TLE! ’ ’ No, it wasn’t the championship
game. This was just the practice.

For two hours, three nights a week,
we had hockey practice with Coach
Bankman. During those two hours, we
were told we couldn’t skate, couldn’t
shoot, pass or even sit the right way
— the Bankman Way. But I guess that
was OK, we could take it. What the
heck, we were seven years old. Well,
no, some players on the team were
eight and a few were six.

By the end of practice, most of us
would come off the ice in tears (which
you could always hide by saying it was
just sweat) and our toes frozen in skates
that were always a few sizes too big.
Even in the locker room after practice,
Mr. Bankman didn’t let up. In there,
we were told in no uncertain terms
what we did wrong in practice that day.
This was a man heavily inﬂuenced by

both Vince Lombardi and Attila the
Hun. He was ruthless. I hated 

The season wore oii, and we found
we had a pretty good team. We were

in ﬁrst place most of the year. That’s,

not surprising. I think the main reason

A we won is because we were afraid of ,
what would happen to us in practice the

next week if we lost. We made the
playoffs and won easily, eventually
making our way to the championship
game.

I’ll never forget the feeling in the
locker room before that game.
Bankman ordered all parents out and
locked the door. The room was still as
he looked us over, like a general in-
specting the troops before a battle. He
didn’t say anything for a long time.
Finally he spoke. __, _ _, ,

“Boys, I’ve been coaching a long
time, and I have never won a cham-
pionship game. Today I will. This is
the most important game we have ever
played and the most important game I
have ever coached. I want you to go
out there and hustle. HUSTLE-, HUS-

TLE, HUS'I'LE — that’s the key, boys.
If we do that, we win. If we don’t, I

, don't ever want to coach you boys

11

again.
With that he paused and finally
ordered a quiet, dramatic “Let's go,
boys.” I was nervous before the
speech, but I was terriﬁed after it. I
think we all felt that we controlled this
man’s future happiness with our play
today. Maybe some sports psychologist
can ﬁgure it out, but even though I
hated him, I wanted to win that game
for him more than anything else in my
life.

The first period started well for us‘.
We went up by two. I even played a
regular shift. By the end of the second
period, our fortunes had changed. We
were down 3-2 with 12 minutes left to
play. Then Bankman did something I
never saw a coach do before or since.

He called the ﬁrst line into the locker
room inbetween periods. We stayed on
the bench, but from a hundred I could
hear him screaming at the players. He
called them “losers,” “lazy” and a

‘ ‘disappointment to your fathers.’ ’ The
entire arena heard him. This ‘was
mnti_vation?

Whatever it was, it worked. Mr._
Bankman kept the ﬁrst line in the en-
tire third period, and they scored ﬁve
goals to give us a 7-3 win and the
championship. If we weren’t out-
weighed by our coach by 240 pounds,
we probably would have carried him
off the ice.

In the lockerroom after the game, I
saw T.J., our best player, sitting with
his equipment still on, crying.

‘*What’s wrong with you?” I asked.
“We won and you scored four goals,
so.what’s"the matter?”

He just looked at me_ and said, “I’m
quitting, I hate hockey.” I didn’t
believe him at the time. I thought he
was just tired, but T.J. never did play
hockey again. He did go on to become
one of the leading rushers in our
school’s history, though.

So what’s the point? Just that'while
many say Pee-Wee League sports like

"hockey and football or Little League

baseball build character, I say that it

just breeds characters. I really don’t
think Mr.'Bankman taught me any
lesson about the importance of win-
ning. He was just a coach who took it
all too seriously and now is still the
target of a lot of stories whenever my
old hockey friends and I get together.

No, sports alone cannot build
character —— that has to come from
somewhere else, starting with the fami-
ly. Sports should never be the primary
force shaping any kid’s character.
Show me a kid whose character and
moral values were shaped mainly by
playing youth sports, and I will show
you one very disturbed young man.
The fact is this: Sports, when taken
seriously by_ a kid, can become a
dangerous thing. He starts to think that
life is a series of wins and losses, and
he never learns the value of com-
promise or cutting your losses at a

‘strategic point.

Sports are great when taken as a hob-
by — but only when taken as a hobby.

Pitt hockey club ﬁghts uphill battle

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club ﬁnished should have gone further. This year

How many of Pitt’s varsity football
players would continue to participate
in the sport if they were required to
share the expense of renting the
stadium every time they wanted I0
practice or hold a game? The thought
alone is absurd, and it would be un-
thinkable to allow only those who could
afford the expenses to participate.
Besides, a lot of talent would go to
waste.

However, there is a group of athletes
at Pitt who choose to invest a great deal
of time and money to participate in a
sport which the university, for many
reasons, refuses to support. The Pitt-

portunity, this club could bring back to
Pitt some of the recognition and glory
lost by the football team in the past two
seasons. The sad fact is that you can
only play hockey for Pitt if you can af-
ford to pay the dues. Fortunately for
the Pittsburgh Hockey Club, many
talented athletes are willing to make the
monetary sacriﬁce in order to have the
opportunity to play for this quality pro-
gram. Many others, however, are op-
ting to play for teams such as CMU and
Duquesne where the expense is not
nearly as great.

“It’s disheartening. You really are
playing for Pitt as much as they don’t

along with present coach Jim Owens
Sr. will be Roger Oldaker who came
to Pitt after coaching CMU last season.
Oldaker stated that one of his reasons
for electing to come to Pitt over CMU
is because his son plays for Pitt and
‘ ‘it’s a lot more fun to coach with him
than against him.”

Aside from a new coach, the Pan-

thers have also aquired several talented .

skaters including left wing Brian
Owens, from the Junior Pens, and
center Tim Ross, a sophomore from
Penn State McKeesport. “Picking up
those two guys is going to helpalot,”
said right wing Roger Oldaker Jr.

Athlete 9f the Week

Tony Woods

 

This week’s Pitt News Athlete of the
Week is junior defensive end Tony
Woods. Woods, a 6-4, 230-lb. native
of Newark, N.J., recorded 11 tackles,
six of which were for a loss, in Pitt’s
42-7 destruction of South Carolina.
Nine ofthe 11 tackles made by Woods
were unassisted.

“I thought this ball game was the
best he’s played since he’s been here,”
noted Pitt head coach Foge Fazio, a
man who knows defense.

Woods came to Pitt a highly touted
player out of Seton Hall Prep where he

' was an All-America and All-State per-

former. He has been bothered by in-
juries the past two seasons, but has
managed to remain healthy thus far this
season. Last year, Woods appeared in

seven games and made 36 stops, three
of which were sacks.

‘ ‘We’ve always known Tony had the
ability to play games like that,” said
Fazio, referring to Woods’ perfor-
mance against South Carolina. “Unfor-
tunately, he broke his ankle freshman
year and was bothered by a lot of in-
juries last year as a sophomore.” Fazio
added, knocking on wood, “This year,
every down he’s been out there. He’s
been practicing well, and he’s shown
he’s getting his confidence back. He’s
starting to understand the defense and
his responsibilities.”

Proofliesinthe52stopshehasmade
this year, second on the team only to
linebacker Steve Apke, who has 68.
Woods does lead the squad in
unassisted tackles, however, with 33
single-handed stops. Woods’ play
reminds Fazio of one of his former
pnze pupils. _

“I think he 18 getting to the place
where he is starting to compare to
Rickey Jackson,” noted Fazio. “He’s
got good strength, and he holds his
position rather well.”

Jackson was the starting defensive
end opposite Hugh Green in the early
’80s. He is now an All-Pro outside

linebacker for the New Orleans Saints.

While Jackson suffered an identity
crisis at- Pitt playing second ﬁddle to
Hugh Green, Woods has begun to
make his name known across the
nation.

"‘I think Tony Woods, as I look at
the Pitt defense, is the best defensive
player we will play against all year,”
said North Carolina State head ,coach
Tom Reed yesterday. “He’s,a domi-
nant force, and that’s how you win
football games, with'dominant forces
out there.”

That is high praise from a coach
whose team will play, among others,
Georgia Teeh,,_ Maryland, Clemson,
North Carolina am _-Vir inia this year.

“He’s hard to bloc because he
comes ‘pretty hard and he’s Q35
pounds,” explained Fazio’. ‘_‘He runs
really fast, and he can put the moves
on you.”

Woods is not the only member of his
family making a name for himself. His
younger brother, Darrel, also plays
defensive end for Pitt but is only a
freshman. When Darrel was in high
school, Joe Butler of Metro-Index
scouting compared him to none other
than Hugh Green. So it seems that Pitt

has a strong future defensively. Only
time will tell.

HONORABLE MENTIONS: Teryl,

Austin-.'— comerback on the football
team — Austin is fast becoming the
most consistent performer in the defen-
sive backﬁeld. Last weekend, Austin
intercepted two passes against South
Carolina. He now has three on the
season. Also, the sophomore from
Sharon, Pa. has emerged as a top-notch
punt returner. He has returned 13 punts
for 109 yards on the season, an average
of just over eight yards per return.
Kris Wexell — outside hitter on the

‘women’s volleyball team — Wexell

was the only bright spot in the Lady
Panthers’ three matches last weekend.
Pitt lost two out of three matches, and
the Wexell performance was in-
strumental in the only victory over Big
East rival Georgetown. Wexell, a
junior from Norwin, recorded a career-

high 17 kills against the Lady Hoyas. '

Lori Wood — women’s cross coun-
try team — Wood recorded the only
ﬁrst place ﬁnish for the Lady Panthers
in their ﬁrst loss of the year last
weekend. to West. Virginia. Wood
ﬁnished ﬁrst on the 5,000 meter course
with a time of 18:41.1.

Tlie'Pitt'News' - October 9, H

Talent:

By Brooks Thomas
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh football
team has been known for the great run-
ning backs who have brought national
acclaim to the program over the last
decade. Tony Dorsett became college
foo_tball’s most prolific ground gainer
while wearing No. 33 as a Panther. Joe
McCall, Bryan Thomas and Randy
McMillan all developed a strong work
ethic at Pitt and went on to play pro-
fessional football.

This year there appears to be an
abundance of talent in the backﬁeld,
and Pitt head coach Foge Fazio smiles
to himself every Saturday afternoon
when a new back rises to the occasion.

‘ ,‘Two years ago we made our minds
up to go out and get some running
backs,” said Fazio. In just over two
years, Pitt has landed-eight top-ﬂight
running backs, including four Parade
All-Americas. The impact these
recruits have made is quite evident, and
Pitt is once again moving up as one of
the nation’s top rushing teams.

The Panthers have been able to run

_ the football very effectively this season

against some very tough defenses like

Ohio State, West Virginia and South _

Carolina. The Pitt running backs are
averaging almost 4.5 yards every time
they carry the football.

Leading the way for the Panthers are
tailbacks Charles Gladman, A.B.
Brown and Brian Davis. They all have
two ‘things in common. All were
Parade All-Americas in high school
and, to the delight of Fazio, all are
underclassmen.

Gladman is a sophomore from
Akron, Ohio and attended Garfield
‘High._School. He is currently ranked
16th 'in the country, averaging 105
yards a game. He had three consecutive
100-yard perfornfances against Purdue,
Ohio State and Boston College. In the
Purdue game, Gladman rushed for a
career-high 163 yards to lead the Pan-
thers to a 31-30 victory. Running back
coach Andy Urbanic feels that Glad-
man’s biggest asset is his vision.

“He can see very, very well which
gives him a big advantage when he is
cutting,” said Urbanic. “All great

backs have this ability. It is very irn- .

portant_,to his running talent.”
A.B.- Brown is a redshirt freshman
from Salem, N.J. He got a chance to

’ prove himself when Gladman and

Davis went down with injuries. Brown
rushed for 101 yards in his ﬁrst career
start against West Virginia and 83
yards the following week against South
Carolina. Urbanic says that Brown’s
success is due to his low center of
gravity" when he is running.

“You have to take him on low or
he’ll get away from you,” said Ur-
banic. “He has good mobility and has
the great ability to spin off tackles.”

Brown is pleased with his decision
to attend the University of Pittsburgh.
“I feel that Pitt has one ofthe best pro-
grams in the country if you're a run-
ning back,” explained Brown. “It’s
good because of the great runners here
like Charles Gladman and Brian
Davis.”

The newcomer who has made big
headlines early in the season is Brian
Davis from Washington, Pa. Davis was
one of the most highly sought recruits
in the country last year. He ﬁnished his
career at Washington High School with
4,478 yards, the 10th best effort in
Pennsylvania history. Davis electriﬁed
the crowd the third time he touched the
football against Boston College when
he broke loose for a 26-yard
touchdown run. He made several
Boston College would-be tacklers look
silly as he juked and spun his way into
the end zone. Immediately, voices from
the crowd began to compare him to the
great Tony Dorsett.

“There is only going to be one Tony
Dorsett,” said Davis. “I just have to
go out on the ﬁeld and do what I can
do best. The fans have to realize that
Tony was the greatest.”

Davis is the ﬁrst Pitt player to gain
100 yards in his‘ ﬁr,st"co1legiate game
since Dorsett. -Nagging hamstring and
ankle injuries have hindered Davis’

 

Plenty at running back at Pitt

development and performance, and his
health is questionable week to week.

“We’re just trying to get Brian
healthy,” said Urbanic. “We really
don’t know how fast he is yet. But
when he has been healthy, he has
shown signs of being a good back.”

The player who often gets over-
looked by the performance of the
tailback is the fullback. He is the
lineman of the backfield. All he does
is open the holes for the tailback _and
pick up the ﬁrst down on a third-and-
one play when the defense is stacking
the middle. Pitt’s three fullbacks are
Tom Brown, Darnell Stone and Zeke
Gadson.

Brown_ is the younger brother of
former Pitt star John Brown, who is
now a graduate assistant coach on
Fazio’s staff. ,

“I am very pleased with the way
Tommy is p1aying,”» said Urbanic.
“He is the throw-back to the old
fullback who will knock your head off
and block you solid. Yet, he is a
punishing back who possesses great
speed and has good hands. He is the
type of football player that you need to
have in front of a tailback in the “I”
formation.”

Brian Davis

Stone is a bit of a different back, ac-
cording to Urbanic. “He has better
speed and may be a little more elusive.
He also has great hands.” The West
Elizabeth, Pa. native was a standout
performer for Thomas Jefferson High
School. He selected Pitt for some

special reasons.

“I chose Pitt because I wanted to
help my team win the Eastern and Na-
tional Championship,” Stone said. “I
also think that the younger kids com-
ing in are starting to realize that Pitt
is producing more and more backs on
the professional level like Joe McCall,
Bryan Thomas and Randy McMillan.
Plus, if I came here I would get the op-
portunity to be coached by one of the
best running back coaches in the nation
in Coach Urbanic.”

Ezekial Gadson is a sophomore from
Frogmore, S.C. Urbanic said that he
has a chance for an outstanding future
at Pitt. Gadson earned a letter last year
for his outstanding special teams play.
A versatile player, he is able to play
both at fullback and tailback.

Eugene Napoleon is a freshman from
Jersey City, N.J . He had the honor of
being pen pals with Tony Dorsett.
Napoleon met Dorsett at a summer
football camp‘ and they became instant
friends. The former St J oseph’s High
School star was named to three AH-
America teams — Adidas, National
Catholic and Scholastic Coach.

“I came to Pitt because of Brian
Davis,” said Napoleon. “I wanted to

Page 17‘. ‘

team up with him. Most kids shy away
from competition and never reach their
potential. Brian will make me a better
football player.”

With such a talented backﬁeld and
only two positions to ﬁeld, one might
think there might be a little animosity
among the players. Not at Pitt.

“We try to push each other,” said
Gladman. “We are all trying to be the
best and that’s going to make us bet-
ter- It_’s a healthy relationship, and
we’re all very close. For us to have the
best group of running backs and to be
so close — that makes the whole dif-
ference. It’s great.”

Tom Brown and Gladman are very
good friends on and off the ﬁeld.
Brown has one particular goal he wants
to accomplish this year. “I’d really like
to score "a touchdown, ’ ’ said Brown as

he glared at Gladman in the locker

room after practice. ’ ‘I did score one
in a scrimmage game up at Edinboro,
but a certain someone got caught clip-
ping and they called it back.”
Gladman looked up to his running
Inate, smiled and said, “And I want to
meet you in ‘the end zone with the ball
in your hands."
Then they both laughed.

high goals for career

By Alan Abraham
Staff Writer

Scott Reimer has a dream. Ever so
modestly he says, ‘ ‘I would really like
to play professional soccer.” Pausing
foramomenthecontinued, “Although
it would be great, I know it’s only a
dream. Idoubt it willevercometrue.”

Although Reimer may or may not
end up like his coach Joe Luxbacher,
a former member of the 1978-79 Pitts-
burgh Spirit, he is a hard-working, en-
thusiastic soccer player.

Reimer, the second-leading scorer on
this year’s team, enjoys playing soc-
cer. During the off-season, Reimer
played on two indoor leagues in his
hometown of Bethlehem, Pa. Talking
about the indoor surfaces, Reimer
points out the advantages and setbacks
of playing on artiﬁcial turf. “I like
playing indoor soccer. The ﬁeld length
is shorter and it’s really fun, but your
legs take a beating on the turf. I prefer
a nice, well-kept grass ﬁeld.”

Reimer, who is also a member of the
Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity on campus,
practices two and a half hours per day,

ﬁve days per week, with his teammates
and Coach Luxbacher. During the off-
season, he practices two hours per day
and lifts weights the other three days.
Although he goes to practice faithful-
ly, Reimer dislikes the running during
practice. “I like to play, but I really
don’tlikealltherunningwedoinprac-
rice.” Which is understandable — there
aren't many who enjoy running
themselves into condition.
Coach Luxbacher praises Reimer.
‘ ‘Scott has worked a lot over the sum-
mer. He is a very steady and intelligent
player, the type that makes very few
mistakes onthe ﬁeld. He leads theteam
more by his actions than vocally.”
. As far as academics go, Reimer feels
it’s easier during the season to study.
“During the season, I don’t get home
until 7:30 from dinner, andthenlknow
I have to get my studying done. There's
not much time for parties. Even though
I’m a fraternity brother, I usually will
stvay at a party for about an hour or
o

Reimer is a sophomore this year and
hopes he will receive a partial scholar-
ship from the university next year.
“Currently,” he said, “about six guys
on the team have scholarships. Since

we’re not a money—n1aking sport, it’s .

 

ott  ﬁenner

tough to get one.”

. The fact that Reimer doesn’t have a
scholarship this year in no way
discourages his performance on the
ﬁeld. He is, as Joe Luxbacher says,
‘ ‘hard—working and consistent. ’ ’

PANTHER KICKS: The 1985-86
Panther soccer team is currently 8-1
with its only loss at Bucknell. Scott
Reimer will be in action again Friday
night against the West Virginia Moun-
taineers. The team will then return
home to face Georgetown Saturday
afternoon, Oct. 19, at Pitt Stadium.
The‘Big East Soccer Championships
are scheduled for Nov. 8-9 in
Connecticut.

Steelers inconsistent

Pittsburgh’s shoddy 2-3 record can
be attributed to the inconsistent play of
the offense. In the Steelers’ 24-20 loss
to Miami, quarterback Mark Malone
was all but horrendous, passing for a
meager 1~45 yards.and completing on-
ly 42 percent of his passes (14-33). The
team’s inability to sustain a long drive
provided the Dolphins with numerous
scoring opportunities. Walter Aber-
crombie surprised the world by having
a good game, rushing for 91 yards on
14 carries. The Pittsburgh defense did
play extremely well, holding Dan
Marino and his offense to 24 points.
One question for Chuck Noll: Did you
draft a quarterback out of Purdue two
years ago, or is that just another vicious
rumor started by the press?

The 49ers rebounded from their
upset loss to New Orleans, whipping
the poor Atlanta Falcons 38-17. Joe
Montana set team records for passing
yardage (429) and touchdown passes
(5). Falcon quarterback Steve Bart-
kowski was forced to leave the game
with a knee injury. In two games with
the Falcons this year, San Francisco
has outscored Dan Henning’s squad
73-33. They will certainly receive a
stiffer challenge from the Bears, who
invade Candlestick Park this Sunday.

What has happened to Seattles’
dominating defense? The once oppor-
tunistic Seahawk defenders have been
giving up miles of yardage and an
abundance of points to opponents.
Despite‘ Sunday’s win over the ailing
Chargers, Seattle surrendered 344
yards passing to backup quarterback

 
 

The

Mark Herrmarm, who is subbing for
the injured Dan Fouts. Herrmann was
able to complete 26 of his 35 pass at-
tempts, three for touchdowns. The
’Hawks will need a defense similar to
the one they ﬁelded last season to con-

' tend in the ornery AFC West.

The New York Jets are the surprise
of this young season. Picked by many
to finish near the bottom of the AFC
East, Joe Walton's team has a 4-1
record and is currently tied with Miami
for first place. Yet before New York
fans start thinking Super Bowl, here’s
a quick ﬂashback: On the eighth week

ii‘

of the 1984 season, the Jets were 6-2. /‘
On the 16th week, they were 7-9. Toe?»

be continued.

The Dallas Cowboys are currently on
a three-garne winning streak. Look for
it to_ end this Sunday in their game
against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Dallas
has been winning, but not impressive-
ly. They squeaked by the Giants this
past weekend on a Rafael Septien ﬁeld
goal with 2:19 left in the game. Pitts-
burgh has had some bad breaks as of
late. They’re due for a big win, and
they’re going to get it in Irving.
Steelers 27-16. A

In the Futility Bowl, Indianapolis
routed the winless Buffalo Bills 49-17.3

Minnesota threatened the L.A.
Rams’ unblemished record until they
were stopped on the final play‘ of the
game, one yard from the goal line. Vik-
ing coach Bud Grant opted to go for
the win instead of a game-tying ﬁeld
goal, but the Rams held and captured
their ﬁfth win 13-10.
