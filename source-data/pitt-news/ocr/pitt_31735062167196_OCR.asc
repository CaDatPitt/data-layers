Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Sig Chi Take Honors

For ’68 Greek Week

by ALAN E. BARR -

Greek Week 1968, entitled “Greek Week at the Movies,”
proved to be very succssful according to John Thompson,
Greek Week chairman. This year’s overall winners were
Sigma Chi and Kappa Kappa Gamma. Mary Ann Zovko,
a sophomore from Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, represent-
ing Phi Kappa Theta, was selected as this year’s queen.
Also, the Mister Fraternity award went to Edward Stack, a Phi Kappa

Theta senior.

The annual Chariot'Race~ kicked off this year’s activities Monday

afternoon. After a balloon scram-
ble for complimentary concert
tickets by the Cathedral Fountain,

the race took place on Bigelow,

Blvd..About 3,000 people witness-
ed the event.

Fun Night, Monday night, be-
gan with a scavenger hunt. The
hunt was a new innovation this
year. This competition in “silly
games” and races among all the
Greeks is the time to let off
steam in preparation for the more
serious events that follow.

Greek Sing Wednesday night at
the Carnegie Music Hall was pre-
sented to a iturnaway crowd. Fol-
lowing the theme of “Greek Week
at the Movies,” each fraternity
and sorority presented selections

‘from the academy award nomin-
ations. The selections covered a‘
. time span beginning with Lulla-

by of Broadway, 1935, all the
way up to Born Free, 1966.
Thursday night, a $2,200 check

_ was presented to the Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh. This check‘

resulted from a charity drive car-
ried on during the week by all
fraternities and sororities. The
Three M company donated a mile
of scotch tape to go with the char-
ity theme of “Silver Stick-up for
Children’s Hospital.” According
to Charles Dorato, charity drive
chairman, enough coins were do-

, lnated to fill more than the mile

of tape.

Friday night’s concert featur-
turing Smokey Robinson and the
Miracles and their Motown Sound,
played to a capacity crowd at the
Syria Mosque. This was the larg-
est group ever assembled for this
type of concert at the Mosque, ac-
cording to Syria Mosque officials.

Culminating Greek Week 1968,
there was a formal dance at the
Churchill Valley Country Club.

35 Students

With Police
A group of 35 students or-
ganized by Don Huber and
Warren Asnes rallied yester-
day in an attempt to bridge
the communication gap be-
tween policemen and Univers-
ity students. '

The students felt that there is‘

insufficient police protection for
college students in the Oakland
area. Various students cited in-
stances where they had been at-
tacked, either on the streets or in

their apartments, and the police

had either disregarded the situa-
tion or tried to arrest the students
instead of their assailants.

A march on Police Station No.
4 was organized at the rally, to
issue a general complaint about
the problem in the streets of
Oakland. At the station, the po-
licemen were very cooperative
as they explained the lack of
manpower to cover all of Oak-
land and Hazelwood

A policeman reiterated the
suggestion that a student forum
be organized, which would meet
with the policemen to talk over
the problems in communication;
and to see if anything could be
done about forming a student self-
protection group.

The students were advised that
any long-range plans would have
to be approved from the head-
quarters downtown. More meet-

ings of the same type will be held “

in the future, to foster student
support of the forum.

The majority of University students and faculty were disappointed

Rockefeller’s recent decision not to seek the Republican Presidential nomination.

Now that Rockefeller is out of the Presidential picture, the students feel there is

Black Power Pr-obed
At University Oratory  

by RUTH ZAPLIN
“I make the assumption that black power is really
going to move,” said Dr. Arthur Tuden, associate professor
of anthropology at the University, Thursday night, at the
University Oratory of the Holy Spirit.

“I would like to see black power groups get as much organiza-
tion as possible. Then they will probably move into political action,”
added Dr. Tuden. Dr. Tuden feels that black power has a better
chance of surviving if there is political power backing the movement.
As of now, Dr. Tuden believes that there is “little or no organization

in the black ghetto.”

‘‘If the blacks strike against
the whites now, I think that they
will lose. Militarily they are out-
numbered and physically they are
not armed,”' he explained. Dr.
Tuden went on to explain the
black power structure.

“On the ideologicall-evel, the
blacks want to completely re-
construct their society. They want
to work within the concept of
values different than American
‘life. In these terms it means a
separation,” explained Dr. Tu-
dem.

“I feel hopeless and helpless.”
“I believe in forceful integra-
tion.” “Parents always tell their
kids not to associate with ‘them,’
and you usually pick up attitudes
from your parents.” These were
just a few of the comments voic-
ed by students concerning black-
white relationships.

“It is easy to kill people and
prolong a ‘war if you don't see
your enemy as a human being.
Therefore, if you think that the
blacks are different kinds of ani-
mals then you have problems.”
said Dr. Tuden. He emphasized
the fact that he blacks were fight-
ing for basic necessities — like
enough bread to eat and better
housing conditions. '

Dr. Tuden explained that the
question of black power was a
difficult one.

Taube Lectures
On New Book
By Andre Gide

by DON MARBURY

“Mainly the story is about the
achievement of spiritual salva-
tion, within the Christian belief,”
said Dr. Myron Taube, English
professor at the University, in his
lecture on Andre Gide’s new book
Strait Is the Gate. “It is about
a boy and a girl and their gradual
development to adulthood,”
Taube went on to say.

These two young people are in
love with each other, and every-
thing seems just right until cer-

tain things begin to happen as

their relationship deepens. “Jer-
ome,A' the young man is a very
naive and thick young fellow who
doesn’t understand the change in
the feelings of Alisha, the young
woman for him,” Taube said.

This change in Alicha’s and
J erome’s relationship starts when
Alisha becomes sick and she and
Jerome are separated. Alisha is
very religious, and believes that
all who love, know God, for God
is love. It is this belief that pat-
terns all her actions.

ADVISING
APPOINTMENTS
The College Advising Cen-
ter will be open as usual 8:30-
5:00 Wednesday. Students who

A choice between Nixon and J ohn-
son, according to the students
and faculty, is no choice at all.

The New York Governor an-
nounced his decision last Thurs-
day. Rockefeller said that he is
definitely not a candidate, he will
not run in any primaries, and will

not campaign for the Presidency ,

because he does not have the
support of the Republican Party.
He feels that the Party instead
is supporting Nixon and there-
fore he does not want to enter
into a personal duel with the
former Vice-President. Such ‘a
duel, he theorizes, will only di-
vide the party and jeopardize
their chances of defeating Presi-
dent Johnson in November.

Dr. Richard Cottam, a Political
Science teacher, thinks that
Rockefeller’s decision is a “very
sad thing for the Republican Par-
ty. “I don't question that Nixon
will get the nomination. This
leaves no possibility of discuss-
ing Vietnam . . . [and] . . . the
the Party without any real choice.

Dr. Carl Beck, a Political Sci-
ence Professor, is “sorry Rocke-
feller isn’t running. It makes
American politics less interesting
and worthwhile.”

Liberal Arts student Jeff Gale
sums up everyone’s disappoint-
ment, “I really can’tsee myself
supporting Nixon and that only
leaves Johnson and I‘m twenty-
one and I’ll vote thisyear and I
want a choice!” ,»

SG MEETING
Student Government will

is open to all students.

“She .is moving away from a.
physical love toward a mystical,
Dr. Divine, love,” Taube pointed
out. Alisha believes that only in

God lies her happiness. She de- at

lights only in the progress she

A makes everyday in her search for

spiritual contentment.

“Actaully Alisha wants to de-
prive Jerome of her love so he
will turn to God’s love,” Dr.
Taube pointed out, “and when a

final attempt by Jerome is made .

to make physical love to Alisha,
she again turns to God, for only
he is to be her bridegroom."

Taube said the essence and the
understanding of the book is
caught in this Bible verse re-
peated throughout the book. “Two

 Noble  ttempt

The: problem of mutual hostility between the stu-
den‘ts*"'*ai1d the city police is still hovering in the air
over the University. It has been brought to our atten-
tion,,_ however, that a number of students have organ-
ized a group to open up a flowing dialogue between
the police and the students.

The group co:ntends that the basis for the hostil-

 

. ity, all of us witnessed, resulted from a lack of com-

munication between the city police and the students.
They feel that the only means of rectifying this seri-
ous problem is for students to attempt to meet the
patrolman and realize their problems.iWith this un-
derstandi‘ng through the means of open communica-
tion, the hostile feelings will be significantly reduced.

We must say that the student group has hit the
problem right on the head. There is, for example, no
hostility whatsoever between the students and the
University police. There has never been a serious in-
cident, to our knowledge, that has occurred between
the University police and the students. We feel that
this climate exists because the students know the Uni-
versity policemen; they communicate with our secur-
ity men. And this is an ideal situation.

It is necessary, however, for this ideal situation
toexist between the students and the city police; it is
necessary for more students to join in this group’s
effort to establish a cooperative dialogue for we cer-
tainly don’t want to witness another evening when
students are arrested and billey clubs are used.

The efforts of this group is a giant step forward
toward establishment of‘ a needed rapport between
law enforcement officers and students. It is this sort
of activity that will ultimately reduce the mutual
hostility and ensure the sort of police cooperation
that will make the University campus a truly safe
area. -

The Unthinkable

The announcement that New York Governor Nel-
son Rockefeller will not run in this year’s presidential
primaries has caused us to think of the unthinkable:
a presidential campaign between President Johnson
and former Vice-President Richard Nixon.

By most standards, Gov. Rockefeller is thought
toxbe a political moderate. He is also an individual
who commands a great deal of respect. Yet, the lead-
ership of the Republican party is not firmly behind
the Governor. And we feel that this is a misfortune
if not a catastrophy for the :nation.

In his press conference, Gov. Rockefeller hinted
about his views concerning Vietnam. The Governor in-
dicated that he was not in total agreement with the
E,res~'j,,en‘t’s handling of the war. Thus, the Governor
 have provided the American people with an
alternative if he had decided to run for the Presi-

  

it stands now, Richard Nixon has a pretty
good ‘shot at the Republican presidential nomination.
And’we'consider this to be catastrophic for Mr. Nixon
and Mr. Johnson share many of the same views. Mr.
Nixon thought the Kerner Riot Commission report
was off base in that it singled out White America as
the culprit. On this point President Johnson maintain-
ed a shrewd political silence.

Both men say they desire peace in the world.
Both men want to endthe war in Vietnam. But both
of_ the political leaders say that the U.S. must main-
tam its commitment to the South Vietnamese people.
In short, they haven't told the American people how
they are going to end the war.

We cannot agree with President J ohnson’s policy.
Nor can we adhere ourselves to the nebulous state-
ments of the former Vice-President. In this possible
situation, all we can say is flip a coin and then vote.

The War Game --

 

Toy Rifles Arc N 0 Fun Anymore 

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

I was ten-years-old and I had a wooden
toy rifle and my friends had wooden toy
rifles and we played War. It was a game.

We were the post World War Two babies
and ,we knew about the Japs and the Germans
and we knew they were the enemies. We play-
ed this game called war. —

We always played at night
and always on the same city
block and always we split-up in-
to two groups, the good guys
and the bad guys.

WE NEVER SHOT pellets
from our wooden toy rifles. We
would m ake the ack-ack-ack
sound of a machine gun and we
killed the good guys or the bad
guys in this way,

But of course there always
was one person, who would ar- 
gue that he wasn't killed when G. LIES
when the ack-ack-ack sound was heard and he

claimed that he was well-hidden, undercover
and away from the ac-ack-ack.

But then this was only a game, and one
could stand there and argue that he Wasn't
dead despite the ack-ack-ack. It was a game
called War, but to us the game was real and
we didn’t want to die and we didn't want to
hear the ack-ack-ack.

On one -of those nights, when we were en-
gaged in War, I was a good guy. I was the U.S.
army and like U.S. army soldiers I felt that I
couldn’t be killed and that someone up there kept
his eye on me. ‘

I WAS WALKING down an alley  night
and it was dark and I couldn’t see the other
side of the street and the now hidden fence
wl1.*.ch was -always there in the daylight.

I was crouched low and I was walking slow-

er than before because I was coming to a cor-
ner where the overhead street light would soon

disclose my position to the enemy-

I came to a pair of steps protruding from
the flat dark wall and I was 20 feet from the
corner. Then I heard and I felt it. Ack+ack-ack.
I was shot and I fell to the ground.

THE ENEMY WAS hiding behind the fence
and I didn’t see him. Ack-ack-ack. I was hit a
second time and I was dying.

I fell into the gutter and it was wet and
smelled from the rain and all I thought was
that I was too young to die.

Suddenly the black sidewalk and the gutter
meant death. I had been amb-ushed in the night
and I never knew what hit me and Ilwas dying
I was a U.S. army soldier and I was dying.

But this was a game called War and we
played it two or three nights a week and I
probably would be killed again and probably
would have a chance to kill, whether I Was a
good guy or a. bad guy.

WE MIMICKED THE WAR movies on tele-
vision and the game we played was well suited
to the city block and we played the game well.

But today the city block cannot be made into a
swamp-infested jungle and the toy wooden
rifles and the ack-ack-ack have no place in to-

- day's game called War.

It doesn't matter today if you can hide be-
hind a fence because even the good guys kill
everyone within a certain area and then they
say that they do it to save people. ‘it i

The game called War has become uglier
and the reason for playing the game has been
forgotten by too many people in too short a

. Viet Students,
Cry, “Stop War”

(This letter, recez've.d by the
Pitt News, is a. mimeographed
copy signed by 24 Vietnamese stu-
dents in attendance at 14 North
American universities.)

Editor, The Pitt News

We, Vietnamese in North Amer-
ica, speaking as individuals and
independently of any political or
religious organization, together
voice our anguished concern over
the war in our country.

At the moment, in the name of
the highest-sounding principles,
the parties to the conflict in our
country are fast reducing our
villges and cities to ashes and
rubble; in the process, tearing
apart the whole fabric of our so-
ciety.

To our widows‘ and orphans, to
our civilians mangled and bum-
ed beyond recognition, to our
dead rotting unburied in sun and
rain, we owe nothing less than
the truth: this is not a struggle
for freedom and democracy; it
has become a war of genocide.

By now, it is clear that there
are limits to what American pow-
er can do to Vietnam. Unleashing
on a small country the most do
structive firepower ever known
to mankind, the United States
has brought our nation to the
brink of annihilation.

The words of the American
commander, that “To save Bentre
it became necessary to destroy
it,” plainly reflect the moral, po-
litical and military “bankruptcy
of American policy in Vietnam_

Both self-interest and moral re- '

sponsibﬂity, then, make it im-
perative that the people and gov-

   

“When I was younger," said
the bright-eyed Pitt coed, “I
thought a boy needed a draft
card so he could get draft
beer.”

  

ernment of the United States take
the lead in ending this conflict.

To end the war before it is too
late, we call upon the American
government to heed Secretary-
General U Thant’s appeal to stop
all bombing of North Vietnam.

We call upon the United States
government, the government of
South Vietnam, the government
of North Vietnam and the Nation-
al Liberation Front to promptly
reach a peaceful settlement. A
lasting peace for Vietnam should
be based upon a total ‘withdrawal
of foreign troops that will allow
us, Vietnamese, to shape our fu-
ture free from all foreign inter-
ference.

We urgently appeal to the world
community, through the United
Nations", to condemn, in view of
their devastating effects on our
people, the use of chemical war-
fare, napalm, and anti-personnel
‘bombs.

Finally, to prevent the ultimate
crime against mankind, we ask
the General Assembly to forbid
the use of nuclear weapons by
any party in this conflict.

In this dark hour of history, we
appeal to all men of good will
in the world, particularly in the
United States, to join us in de-
nouncing this war and in work-
ing for an immediate return of
peace to Vietnam.

tions you are chosing. You lead
us deeper and deeper into a war

distrust and in many cases out-

How do I, or any citizen, force
you to listen when men who have
devoted a lifetime to the study
of the international situation
have tried and failed. Gavin, Ful-
bright, Kennedy, Morse — these
are not ignorant men, impract-
'ical men, or men scared to fight.
They and many others, including
people like myself have given
careful thought to the meaning
of not supporting their own coun-
try’s policies.

Please consider . - 01‘ if con-
sideration 'will not change your

the destiny of the United States.
I write not with harshness toward

mediate needs of our country.
This need, at this time, surpass-

Gustine Easily Handles
Strikes, TD’s, Baskets

by Roy Jacobs
Sports Editor

ZZZZZEEZEIEEZZ

There’s a big decision facing “Mr. Field House” in the
very near future. Will it be baseball or spring football?

“Mr. Field” House” is Frank Gustine, sophomore pitcher of

footballs and baseballs and shooter of basketballs. At least. thats
what his friends call him.
. . . .Right now, Frankie is a pitcher for Bobby Lewis‘, Last week
in California he started two games, won one and lost the other.
2-1. His victory came over UCLA, the team which won the
tournament..Gustine’s had experience with the Bruins before.
during football season, but with completely different results.
He quarterbacked a Pitt team which lost, 40-8.

“UCLA in baseball is still a powerhouse,” commented Gus-
tine. “The next night the scored 22 runs. They play like a ma-
jor league club, and their players are probably the best in Cali-
fornia.” .

Yet, Frank admitted that beating UCLA in baseball isn’t
quite the same as beating UCLA in football. Football is still
THE sport here, and therein lies his problem. Spring practice
starts April 20. Baseball season ends May 29. Hmmm.

“I’d sure hate to be in my shoes,” smiled Gustine.

Unfortunately, Frank is in his shoes. Out on the Coast, he
knew pro scouts were watching him and fellow pitchers George

' Medich and Dave Welty. He knows he stands more of a chance

in pro baseball than pro football. 6

He alsoknows how improtant spring football is. He knows
he can be the number one quarterback this year. and that the
spring is the time to get himself established. What’s he going
to do? A _
In Gustine’s case, he can turn his thoughts tobasketball be-
cause he plays that; too. Not to mention going to school.

“I don’t have school down to the ‘T’ yet,” offered Gustine,
“but I know what my capacities are.- One spring I missed play-
ing baseball, and my grades dropped. When I’m playing, it

y gives me added incentive to work harder.

“‘I enjoy playing three sports,” he added. “I just have a

9' hard time leaving football, baseball, or basketball alone.”

Things got to the point where, during February, Gustine
spent his early afternoons practicing baseball and his late after-
noons working with the basketball team. That is, when he got

I A the chance. And, when he didn’t play, it hurt his game.

“When you don’t play for a while, you get shaky, you’re
not so sure you're good enough,” he remarked. “I’d like to talk
to the new coach (Buzz Ridl) about getting a good shot at play-
ing next year. I never got a chance last year, and I thing I can
help the team.”

The cances are he could. During football season. Gustine
had streaks where he played outstanding football. His baseball
record to date speaks for itself. Why not basketball, too?

But basketball is another eight months away. April 20‘ is
three and a half weeks away. Gustine doesn’t have an easy de-
cision to make, and perhaps somebody will make it for him. It
just makes you wonder why Chip Hilton didn’t have the same
problems.

Expresses .\Iixed Emotions

Salter Leads
Thinclads To
AMA Titles

Thd indoor track season was
extended a little longer for
some of the varsity and freshmen
thinclads. Saturday afternoon a
small squad of runners entered
the Allegheny Mountain Associa-
tion championships at South Park
andcameout of it with a batch of
fine performances.

Bryant Salter continued his win-
ning ways by soaring farther and
jumping higher than anyone in
the broad and high jump events.
Salter cleared six feet eight inch-
es in the high jump and leaped
21 feet eight inches in the long
jump.

Thd dash men and the hurdlers
also performed well while pre-
paring for the outdoor season.
Chet Wojiechowski captured the
50-yard dash title in 5.4 seconds.
while Carlos Reisen took first in
the 50-yard low hurdles. Letter-
man Tom Christie placed second
in the 50-yard high hurdles.

Speedster Smitty Brown took
all the marbles in the 600-yard
run with a mark of l:l4.5. Senior
Jack Neyer finished in third place
behind Brown.

The long distancemen did not
fare as well due to the three win
performance of Penn State's Mike
Schurko. Schurko captured th e
mile. two-mile and the 1000. fin-
ishing ahead of Pitt runners.

“We didnt have anything to be ashamed of." he added. Indeed.
after the results were reviewed. it was easy to see Adams was right.
“Dick Shildt did a nice job ” offered Adams. “He did the best for
us. He lost to a real good boy in a real close match.”
Shildt had drawn a bye in the first round. and he won a second
round decision before meeting Parker of Illinois. State. The two ex-
changed the lead a couple times. with Shildt leading. 3-2. with a half

reviewed Adams. “Dick was going all out to get the escape or the re-
verse. and while he was squirming around. he was put on his back for

Bruce Unangst, runner-up at 123 pounds in the Easterns, suffered
the same fate as Shildt in the second round of the 115 competition. At

one point of the bout he was leading, 8-2, but his opponent kept work.

When a good, but not great team finishes 3-4 in a seven-
game tournament that includes some of the best teams in the
country. there has to be some feelings of satisfaction.

But if that team loses some of its games on bad mistakes. the re-
sult is mixed emotions. Baseball coach Bobby Lewis returned from sun-
ny Californis both happy and disappointed.

For instance. defeating UCLA. 4-3, last Tuesday night made Lew-
is exceptionally happy.

“UCLA was the champs of the tournament again,” said Lewis,
realizing that the Uclans also finished first in last year’s National Col-
legiate B a s e b a l 1 Tournament.
“And we beat them. I think that
showed something.”

Lewis was also pleasantly sur-
prised in the individual perfor-
mances of some of his players.

“Sammy Glass. our catcher.
was placed on the all-tournament
starting nine," beamed Lewis. “he
hit real well. I think his tourna-
ment average was .384 or high-

I‘.

Thd pitching performances of
footballers Frankie Gustine and
George Medich also please Lew-
is. Gustine finished with a 1-1
record, defeating UCLA and los-
ing to Mississippi State, 2 - 1;
while Medich finished with a 1-0
mark, shutting out Tennessee, 4-
0, on a four-hitter.

Medich also started against
Oregon and pitched eight innings
in which he gave up two runs,
but they were both unearned. He
was notinvolved in the decision.

“Gustine and Medich were
pleasant surprises,” said Lewis.
“It was their first starts in col-
lege competition and I didn’t
know what to expect. But now I
know that I have at least three

“I though we did real well over-
all,” said Lewis on a happy note.
“It was a gruelling tournament
in which we played a good team

S01idPitChel'S- in every game, and managed to
  stay in just about every one of
them.” I
TENNIS TIMES

Lewis was disappointed, how-
ever, in losing those close ones.

“We lost a few games that we
could have won if we got the key
hit or fielding play. but we did-
n’t,” explained Lewis. referring
to the‘ 2-1 loss to Mississippi State.
and the 5-4loss to Oregon. “That’s
what makes baseball what it is.
but we were still a little disap-
pointed.”

Intramurals director Leo Be-
mis announced that starting to-
day the tennis courts behind
Trees Hall will be open for use
by students.

The schedule until the end of
the term shows f ou r courts
available to the University com-
munity Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 6
p.m. and Tuesday and Thurs-
day from 12:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Saturdays the courts are open
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. while on
Sundays they open at 11 a.m.

However, the courts are not
available during tennis meets.

Lewis was also disappointed in
his téam’s hitting.

“We didn’t hit as well as we’d
have liked to.” explained Lewis.
“but that was understandable.
There were a lot of tough pitch-
ers in the tournament, and we
didn’t practice as much as we’d
have liked to in Pittsburgh.”

 

Wrestlers Fail to Place at Nationals,
But Adams Views Trip As Beneficial

It was a long weekend for wrestling coach Dave Adams
and five varsity grapplers, but their trip to Penn State for the
national championships was nevertheless worthwhile.

“I wasn't too happy with the results." indicated Adams about his

team’s low point showing. “but it was definitely a worthwhile trip. es-
pecially for the sophomores. It was wonderful experience for all the

partly because he was down a weight. and the other guy kept pushing
him." Still. Adams had no second thoughts about having Unangst drop
a weight class.

“I feel Bruce had as much ability as anybody in the 115 pound
class." he said. “Not having the chance to wrestle there at all during
the season hurt him."

One other senior matman competed for Adams, that being Terry
Hoover at 191. Hoover also won his first round match, but lost to Gene
Detweiler of Colgate, an Eastern runner-up.

“They had themselves a good match." reported Adams-_ "T91‘F.V

Eastern Champ Dave Shidemantle
Seeks National Longhorse Crown

by MARTHA HARTLE

“I think I have a good
chance to win." said a confi-
dent Dave Shidemantle looking
forward to the gymnastics nation-
als in Tucson. Ariz.. next week.

"l.ll definitely place in the top
five." he added.."from what I
know of the competition in other
part of the country."

He cited the competition com-
ing from boys from Southern Illi-
nois. Michigan State and Califor-
nia. but was extremely confident
about a first place berth. "I can
win it." he continued.

Shidemantle, a senior from But-
ler, will be competing in the long-
horse event at the nationals. He
qualified at the Easterns in March
where he took first place with
a combined score of 9.40. In dual
competition this season in the long-
horse. he won the event eight
times.

Hampered b_y a leg injury dur-
ing the last two meets of the sea-
son. he says the leg is completely
healed now and hes in top shape
for the nationals. His winning per-
formance at the Easterns was a
good indication of the kind of
shape he's in.

Preparing for his last meet as
an undergraduate. he’ll be prac-
ticing about three hours a day. “I
won't be doing anything differ-

ent. except put a little more con-
centration on the longhorse." he
commented.

Coach- Warren Neiger will ac-

continue through the weekend. If
confidence has anything to say
about winning at the meet’. coach
Neiger will be accompanying a
