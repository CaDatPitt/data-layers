vote 111
primaries

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Of the nearly 3,000 registered voters in
Litchﬁeld Towers and Schenley Quad, 12
voted in Tuesday’s primary elections. '
‘ Primary elections took place across
"Pennsylvania on Tuesday as people made

’ their way out to the polls to vote for vari-

ous state and local party candidates.The
elections went well for the incumbents, with
most winning a bid for re-election —— al-
though one had a thin margin. «
But the polls in Oakland remaine

relatively quiet during the election. The '

four polling machines in Posvar Hall
were left_empty for most of the day, ex-
cept during visits from a few “dedicated
students” that ventured out in the rain,
said poll worker Alethea Sims. .

' She said that as of 2 p.m., only four
_voters had shown up. By the time the
polls closed at 8 p.m., the number had
increased to 12. - ‘

But she added that this was normal
for a primary that was not presidential,
especially since most students are o_n
summer break and not around to_vote.

Barbara DeRiso, an employee work-
ing the polls in Soldiers & Sailors Memo-
rial Hall, said that she s'aw,a'few more

voters than P_osvar’s'workers did. By the '

time they were closing up, -the total had
risen to 69 voters..

She said they expected no more than i
a total 100 voters during the 13 hours
the polling station was open. Compared
to the 500 that showed up in the 2008
election, she said the number seems
trivial. ' , -

University  
announces k
new honors

Mallory (lurossman
News Editor

Edward Stricker grew up thinking that a

' teacher was the best thing a person could :a

be in this world. To him, it always seemed .
obvious where his future would take him. '
But Stricker’s gone a bit farther than

teacher. Startingjuly 1, Stricker will take’
over as the dean of the University Honors
College, a position that will allow him
to inﬂuence and teach the hundreds of
students enrolled in the college. ‘
Stricker, a Pitt neuroscience profes-
sor, said he decided to pursue the open
position as dean of the Honors College
because he wanted a bigger platform to be

-able to have more inﬂuence to do good.

“I can do more good as an educator »
from the dean’s ofﬁce than from in the
classroom,” Stricker said.

The‘ new dean has plenty of ideas for
the future of the Honors College. ' ~

His main goal is to make the ‘school
more inclusive of both students and

-faculty.

‘.‘In most schools, the honors college

is something that’s separate, but that has

never been the case at Pitt,” Stricker said. '
‘.‘I don’t want it to be a special nugget

that only some students can take advan— ‘is

tage of.” V _ . .
Stricker plans to open up the Honors
College to more people who might beneﬁt

from it and contribute to it, but who right
. , now simply don’t know about it. He wants
this effort to reach all schools, not just the

School of Arts 8: Sciences.

Pitt students among runners in third Marathon

Alex Oltmanns
Assistant News Editor

Despite the rainy weather on Sunday morn-
ing, close to 18,000 people ran as fast as
they could to Heinz Field, and it wasn’t for
a Steelers game..

Instead, the crowd ran in the third annual
Pittsburgh marathon.

The full race, which started at7 a.m.,
spanned 26.2 miles. There was also
a ha1f—marathon option. Both began
Downtown at the corner of Sixth Street
and Liberty Avenue and ended in the
North Shore by Heinz Field, as runners
crossed the Roberto Clemente Bridge.

Runners from all across the world converged
on the Steel City to run the race, including
a number of Pitt students. ‘

For senior Mike Tallerico, the _run
through the various Pittsburgh neighbor-
hoods — especially Oakland — made the
race enjoyable.

“It put on display many of the fantastic
cultural and historical neighborhoods of
Pittsburgh, like the Strip District, the South
Side, Shadyside, East Liberty and Highland
Park,” he said. “I also really enjoyed being
able to run down Forbes Avenue past Pitt’s
campus in Oakland.” A

Pitt students played a prominent role in .

the race, not just running the course, but

aiding in other aspects of the event, as well
like interning and volunteering to ensure the
race went smoothly, said spokeswoman for
the marathon Karen Fredette." .
More than 3,500 volunteers could be
found across the course, providing aid to
the runners. More than 80 musical acts and

V entertainers performed along the route to

keep the runners’ minds off their fatigue.
“There must have been hundreds of vol-
unteers and marathon staff out on the course
throughout the day,” Tallerico said.
“They were all extremely helpful, thank-
ful and motivating to all of us runners.”

was helpful, not just during the race, but in
the days leading up to the event, as well.

“Lots of volunteers were present at the
expo event held at the David Lawrence Con-
vention Center Friday and Saturday before
the race. It was a great build-up for the day,”
she said.

“The expo event featured vendors for all
things running-related and informational
booths regarding the marathon.”

The marathon was eventually won by
Jeffrey Eggleston of Rochester, N.Y., with
an unofﬁcial time of 2:16:40. Bekele Delele—
cha of Ethiopia set the pace for the women,‘
crossing the ﬁnish line in 2:35:34.

Primaries 4 1 9 '

Mark Wolosik, the Allegheny County
Elections Director, said that the expect-

ed turnout rate across Allegheny County

was 28 percent, which is consistent with
municipal primaries. About 20 percent
actually voted. Pennsylvania has closed
primaries, meaning that voters can only

vote for candidates in the party in which E

they are registered.

There are ﬁve districts in Allegh-
eny that had city council seats up for
grabs. These include districts 1, 3, 5, 7
and 9.Darlene Harris narrowly snagged
the Democratic candidacy for District 1,
beating her opponent by three percent of
the votes. The incumbent almost lost to
Vince Pallus. ‘ -

Kyndall Mason, the campaign coor-
dinator for Harris, said that she was
running on a platform of experience
and leadership. She said Harris prides
herself on being a neighborhood activ-
ist and “not being a yes—person for the
mayor.”

District 3 re—elected Bruce Kraus as
the Democratic candidate, who won
about 55 percent of the vote.

Doug Shields, thecurrent city coun-
cilman for District 5, decided to run for
district judge, so his district was open
to newcomers. Corey O’Connor won the

Democratic nomination witliabout 70
percent of the vote.

Patrick Dowd, the incumbent,,was
re—elected in District 7 with about 65
percent of the vote.

Mac Booker, Dowd’s campaign man-
ager, said that Dowd’s main issue in this
election was neighborhood quality of
life, and he was standing on his previous
records on the city council. _ -

“He’s better than his opponent be-
cause he’s proven himself in council,

— working hard for people in his district,”

Booker said. »
Ricky Burgess won District 9.

.. Vic Stabile was elected as the judge
of the Superior Court, Anne Covey was
elected for judge of the Commonwealth
Court and Mike Marrno and Alexander

Bicket were elected for judges of the

Court of the Common Pleas.

Positions for county—wide posts were
also up for re—election, including County
Chief Executive, County Controller and
County Treasurer. ‘ C .

“College can be a fabulous experience

a foundation for the rest of your life,” he

Through being dean, Stricker is aiming
to widen the reach of his philosophy. But
he will not be giving up teaching.

“I’m going to keep teaching, it would '
be a punishment not to,” Stricker said.-

Stricker has had a passion for teaching
ever since he was a ‘child. To him, be-
coming a clean is just the next step in. his

Growing up as a child of immigrant
parents, Stricker had the importance of
education drilled into him from a young
age.

tion,” Stricker said. ‘ . 4

Don’t depend on
‘functional foods’

Want to lower your cholesterol?
Reduce your risk of heart dis-
ease? Improve your digestion?
It’s not as simple as visiting the
grocery store.

Wellness is nothing less than
an obsession for countless Amer-
icans, and, as with‘ many obses-
sions, companies can take the
golden opportunity to exploit the
public’s general lack of knowl-
edge. 4

On Saturday, The New York
Times ran an article critiquing
foods and beverages that claim
to carry various health beneﬁts.
They’re called “functionalfoods,”

and they’re becoming an increas- ‘

ingly widespread phenomenon.
In 2009, the sale of these prod-
ucts in America totaled $37.3
billion — a roughly 15 percent
increase from 2005, according»
to the estimates of the Nutrition
Business Journal, a market re-
search firm. .

This wouldn’t be a problem if
such foods actually accomplished
their purported function. But
more often than not, according to
The New York Times, the claims
on their packages are disingenu-
ous at best. ’

Quaker Oatmeal Squares cere-
al, The New York Times reports,
advertises on the front of its box
that “Oatmeal helps reduce cho-
lesterol.” Superﬁcially, this isn’t
inaccurate: Fiber, which can be
found in the cereal, is generally
considered beneﬁcialfor cardiac
health. But as the Times notes,
consumers would need to eat
three bowls of the product per
amount of-‘ﬁber necessary to re-
dué”risl€‘df heart disease.

Other marketing ploys are less
genuine and have been pursued
as such by government agencies.
Dannon’s Activia yogurt, for in-
stance, was marketed “in com-
mercials as “clinically proven
to help regulate your digestive
system in two weeks” when eaten
every day.

But the Federal Trade Com-
mission found that, in some of
the company’s studies, Activia

accomplished no more than a

’ placebo, and that digestive im-

provement — when it did occur
— involved eating the product
three times at day, which ads did
not mention. In 2009, Dannon
agreed to settle a false advertis-
ing lawsuit with the FTC while
denying any wrongdoing, the Los
Angeles Times reported.

We cite these examples not to
suggest that every food product
purporting to lower cholesterol,

- reduce the risk of heart disease

or improve digestion is a sham
— merely to advise that, when
evaluating a product’s health

V beneﬁts, consumers. must exer-

cise extreme skepticism.

' Ideally, we shouldn’t have to
depend on these foods to improve
our well-being. There are count-
less means of attaining ﬁtness,
many of which are cheaper than
such heavily marketed products
and relatively immune to corpo-
rate exploitation.

If people want to reduce
their cholesterol, they neednit
consume three bowls of Quaker
Oatmeal Squares a day. Rather,

they can rely on the sage advice’

of databases like UPMC’s “Health
A to Z,” which counsels readers
to “begin a safe exerciseprogram
with the advice of your doctor,”
“avoid processedand reﬁned
sugars and starches” and “drink
alcohol in -moderation.” This
might entail more effort than
simply eating cereal, but it will

also substantially improve your

lifestyle. . M

food marketing isn’t going to dis-
appear anytime soon, as regula-
tors complained to The New York
Times that they’re struggling to

' stay on top of all the violations.

So itis important for consumers
to pursue alternate means of at-
taining physical well-being --
means which can be found using
sound medical advice as well as

pure common sense. Functional .

foods might be appetizing for the
health-conscious consumer, but
they are rarely, if ever, the best
solution. Q

OK, we’ve got our star._ Since
he’s a '30-something actor playing
a teenager, he’ll need a believable
love interest. This means we’re in
the market for an actress who ap-
pears to be 25-and can therefore
‘realistically portray a 16-year-old
girl. Kirsten Dunst, maybe? She’s

A a mere 29, after all.

Anyway, these two will have
some sort of love-hate relation-
ship that consists of a bunch of
mild wisecracks. Don’t waste
time coming up with wisecracks,
though. Instead, watch a few
hours of “Two and a Half Men,”

the bigiiquestion or have the big
question popped to him, write a
sequence where aliens attack. Set
the assault to an R&B single by
a popular entertainer who will

. eitherappear in that sequence or

incorporate footage from it in his
tie-in music video. Add some stuff
about the Holy Grail, Osama bin
Laden,‘ Hogwarts, Narnia, Don-
ald Trump, long-form birth cer-
tiﬁcates, the _BTK killer, William
“Refrigerator” Perry or whatever

else is hot right now.

Once you’ve got aliens ‘on the
screen, you’re going to need ro-
bots —— thousands of robots, in
fact, each one larger and more
impressive than thelast. One of
these robots will rescue our pro-
tagonist from certain death and,
for reasons that defy logic and
needn’t ever be explained, start.
serving as a-kind of surrogate fa-
ther or grandfather to him. While
opposing the aliens in a series of
colorful battles, the fa'th.er/grand-

father robot will teach the protag— R
onist to believe in himself and, in V

return, the protagonist will teach

’ the father/grandfather robotwhat

it means to be human.
Between the ﬁght scenes, you’ll
want to integrate as many cameo

- appearancesand catchphrases

as possible. Pippa Middleton
is trending high on Twitter, so
put her in there and maybe even
let her shoot an alien in the face
with a laser. The public can’t get
enough of Rebecca Black andher
wretched-yet-hummable single
“Friday,”"so,convince your direc-
tor —.— who will likely be some fat
old hack desperate togstay rele-

vant with a group he refers to as '

“the kids” that includes anyone
younger than 50’ —— to play this

song throughout the movie as well 

‘the kids’

as over the endcredits.

As for catchphrases, write all
of the in—ﬁght dialogue so that it’s
potentially quotable for years to
come. Create a robot character
that looks like a lawnmower and
have him announce that he’s,ready
to “kick some grass.” Havea gruff,
bazooka—wielding military guy say
something about “illegal aliens”
and how, “maybe we should have
built that fence.,_—— in the strata.-
sphere!” as he blasts these space-

men into submission while scor-
ing cheap laughs from. the Tea»

Party set. And ifthis masterpiece
gets an “R” rating for some reason
'— and it never should, because
anything short of 500 decapita-
tions or two side-boob shots is
perfectly acceptable viewing ma-
terial for middle school students

—-— make the protagonist joke -

about how the surrogate father/
grandfather robot taughtlhim the
“importance of lubricant” prior
to deﬂowering his 20—something
teenage girlfriend. ,

This is so gold that ‘we don’t
even have words. If we weren’t
so given over to self—abnegation,
we’d get off our high horse and
make it yourselves. However,
we’re already pulling down the big
bucks here at The Pitt News, and
America needs as many movies

“IN THE RED CORNER  MITT
ROMNEEEEEEEEEEY?’ HOW crazy
would itvbe if the next Republican
presidential candidate —— the rags-
to-‘riches son of automobile execu-
tive and former governor of Michi-
gan George Romney — had passed
state-funded health care? Right?
How could he ever be punished —
well, besides actually having to use
said evil government health care?
He tried to take on Sen. John Mc-.
Cain three years ago, but his butt was
kicked back to liberalism. Thanks

for the support,Mormon-populated .

Utah and Michigan, but I think it’s

Biggest reason Romney could
win the norriination: friends in high

Biggest reason Romney won’t'

win the nomination: health care,
Massachusetts and Mormonism.
Now that’s atrinity. . ‘ V '

loves a good impeachment, so that
will bring him closer to the NObama

tantly, he has a hatred of all things
spending and might, just might, be
able to have a funnier name than the
Democratic candidate. _

Biggest reason Gingrich could
win the nomination: connections

Biggest reason Gingrich won’t

“IN THE RED CORNER  SARAH

my house? Is it Russia? No, it’s for-

mer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, ‘

who many speculate is gearing up for

apresidential run. Ever since McCain ‘

went crazy and nominated her as
his running mate, she has taken this
country for one hell of a tea party.
She hates spending and socialism,

-which she expressed through her

policy of taxing oil companies in
Alaska and redistributing some of
the resultingwealth to residents. She
hates the liberal left-wing media be-
cause it might just actually quote her.
Some would say that she has the total

package with a reality show, elec— A

that includes the high-powered job

of Wasilla, Alaska’s mayor. l
Biggest reason Palin could win

Biggest reason Palin won’t Win
the nomination: mightresign mid-
way through to write a book.

“IN THE RED CORNER  RON
PAUUUUUUUUUL!” I know what

you’re thinking:”Where’s the last-

name? I don’t know if America is
ready for a “ﬁrst-name—for-a—last-
name president.” On secondthought,
though, Obama managed to winwith
two names that don’t really ﬁt either
ﬁrst or last. Besides, if somebody
named Newt can be taken seriously,
why can’t somebody with two ﬁrst
names and a son named Rand be?
Anyway, names aren’t as important
as issues. Mainly: how to bring down
the IRS? Look, we all hate paying tax-
es,'Ron, or, Paul or Ron or  Darrin it!
Have one ﬁrst name! Point is, taxes
suck and conspiracy theorists can
be convincing.

Biggest reason Paul could win the
nomination: representationwithout
taxation! ’

Biggest reason Paul won’t win the
nomination: You really think Iran is

going to negotiate with somebody

‘named President Paul?

If you had any plans in 2012, you
might want to reschedule. Put off
the weddings, and start going rogue
from your normal routine. The Re-
publican primary should provide
the ﬁin happenings of an old-school
establishment going to a tea party.
It will kind of be like “Alice in Won-
derland,” only with a little bit more

_ nonsensical discussion.

The only thing that I can predict
for sure from the upcoming elec-

’ tion season is that I’m going to bust
out the popcorn and pop a seat in —

.front of NBC. I’m readying for the
screaming, the yelling, the misspo-
ken candidates, the accusations, the
smear, the rhetoric, the change (just
kidding) and the joys of victory.

And for the Democrats missing
out on all of the fun, at least it’s not

ALBUM REVIEW

Weird Owl a throwback

Liz Keeney
.Staﬁ' Writer
Weird Owl
Build Your Beast a Fire
Tee Pee Records
B+ '

it Rocks Like: early Black Sabbath, _]ane_’s

Addiction

Even though it might have a similar sounding
name to comical musician Weird Al Yank-
ovic, Weird Owl’s music isn’t parody. Instead,
the Brooklyn—based band has a throwback
sound, reminiscent of the glory days of rock
‘n’ roll in the late ’60s and early ’7os.

With its sophomore release, Build Your
Beast a Fire, Weird Owl serves up its take
on ’7os rock, rich with reverb guitar and
throbbing vocals. In the vein of bands like

Wolfmother and Deer Tick, Weird Owl has .

turned away from the current trends in in-
die rock — which tend to be either folk- or
electronic—based — and has instead drawn
inspiration from the past. Songs like “No
Time Nor No Space” and “Two—Headed
Brother” would ﬁt perfectly on the sound-

tracks of “Almost Famous” or “Dazed and ‘

Confused.”

While the band claims that Build Your

Beast a Fire is “part scientiﬁc, ‘part futuris-
tic, part ancient,” it is deﬁnitely grounded
in vintage rock. The album was produced
in part with Justin Pizzoferrato, who has
worked with Dinosaurjr. and Sonic Youth.

His inﬂuence can immediately be heard

._and is one of the elements thatbrings the

band’s sound to the present. ‘Otherwise,
Weird. Owl runs the risk of becoming too
much of a throwback. If modern listeners
want to hear classic rock, then they’ll listen
to the originals. b

Although Build Your Beast a Fire does
have its issues, it still stands as a testament
to Weird Owl’s musical talent. A great sound-
track for road trips or barbecues, this al-
bum will undoubtedly become a summer
staple. I ‘ a i *  » V “

ALBUM REVIEW

New CD more upbeat than last

Larissa Gula

Staff Writer
Friendly Fires
Pala
XL Recordings
B+

Rocks Like: Phoenix, Passion Pit, Empire A

of the Sun

Four years after releasing its debut album,
Friendly Fires is back in action with a new
release — as well as a, tweaked sound —
that’s hard to resist.

Friendly Fires still sounds like dance
punk, but the band’s mood isn’t as somber
as it used to be. Though certain tracks on
Pala articularly those that reach back to

,1;he7'ba‘nd sfjo ‘dg sound, aren’t ex_tremelyfup—i_

"l1ftli’i jus‘t-astmanyepreach about enjoying
life inits present state. That variety affords
the album a satisfying balance between new
and old. ' ’

The band’s music combines a punk sound
with a dance—club beat while adding a dash
of percussion and funk. The result is a pretty
darn appealing sound. The track titled “True
Love” especially beneﬁts from-thisgcombina-
tion of inﬂuences — the band takes a com-
mon topic andan overused title andzbrings

 

it something fresh. ‘

But not every song is happy — “Chimes”
dials up the funk with lyrics like, “Kissing
the lights / Missing your love / All through
the streets / You’re on my mind.”

Another song, “Helpless,” uses the im- . ;

age of a rising tide to describe feelings of
drowning and despair, complete with seagull
sound effects to enliven the impression of a
nearby vast ocean. This is a strange track -
while other songs include appropriate mood
music, it’s hard to tell what this one is trying
to do. It’s as if the band tried to combine its -
old somber sound with its newer, upbeat

A sound. It didn’t necessarily work.

Asgwith most albums, the singer’s voice is
not always distinct from the music. Although
some songs are perfectly understandable,

others are not. -‘» -~

Overall, though, this album is solid and
perfectly paced. Hopefully this band won’t
take another four years to release some-
thing good. u

It did, when From The Depths Entertain-

despite the group never having contacted the
label. It’s typical for the company’s employees
to search for sounds online and contact bands
they like, according to band manager Mike
Bohnof From The Depths Entertainment.

“We go out and ﬁnd the artists rather than
just letting them come to us,” Bohn said. “Au—

Producers also helped the band tweak its
sound even more, helping it create more and
more of a punk vibe that moves away from i .

' Once he was convinced that the band’s

sound was perfect for the company, Bohn got '

in contact with August‘Ruins. The company
invited the band to meet in Philadelphia, but
the two parties mostly conferenced by way of
phone calls because the band was not able to
travel across the state.

“We met with Mike and he liked us. Every-
thing just kind of moved forward from there,”
Caldarelli said.

And according to Eric Sebula, everything
moved quickly. , g 

“We recorded. We recorded again,” he said.

, “We had an indie record deal in three months.

The Pitt baseball team clinched a“

Big Easftournament berth with a
three-game sweep of West Virginia
this weekend.

The Panthers (31-19, 15-9 Big
East), honored 11 seniors before
the ﬁnal game Sunday and went
on to a 10-6 victory over the reel-
ing Mountaineers (27-23, 13-11 Big
East),_who have ‘lost. seven of t.‘ ieir
last 10games. The Panthers sit at
‘third place in the Big East Confer-
ence, behind Connecticut (37~14—1,
20-4 Big East), who clinched the
regular season championship, and
St._]ohn’s (30-17, 16-7 Big East).

The sweep began on Friday af-
ternoon when junior pitcher Matt
Iannazzo (6-3) threw his fourth
complete game of the season in the
Panther’s 12-1 win.

Iannazzo was named the Big
East Pitcher of the Week for his
performance. ‘ '

“I would take our team against -
any other team in the country if ~

we play the way we played against
West Virginia this weekend,” he
said following the series with West
Virginia.

_ Iarmazzo allowed only one un— .
earned run on six hits — all singles
— walked two -and struck out a '

season-high eight batters.

He was quick to credit his team-
mates for the win.

“We put up 12 runs, which made

me relax a lot,” Iannazzo said. “Ev- _

eryone played really well this week-
end, in that game especially.”

As the ﬁrst starter in the pitch-
ing rotation, Iannazzo sees a lot of
teams for the ﬁrst time throughout

' the season.

Corey Baker, a senior pitcher for

the Panthers, understands how im— .

portant Iannazzo’s successﬁil game
was for setting the tone for the re-
mainder of the series..

“He kept them off balance,”

Barker said. “You never know _

what you’re going to get because
we hadn’t seen these guys play yet
this year.” i  ‘

SOFTBALL

Pitt, falls

in Big East
  Championships

Torie Wytiaz
Stajf Writer

For the second consecutive sea-
son, the Pitt softball team earned
the ‘No. 6 seed in the Big East
Championships before falling to
the No. 3 seed in its first game of
the tournament.

The Panthers fell in a close
2-1 contest to Syracuse in the
quarterfinals on Thursday in
Louisville, Ky., ending a record-
breaking season. This year, the
team set program records for
wins, home runs and shut-outs,

with 34, 51 and 14, respectively. ,

The senior class also made its
contribution to the record books,
as it became the all-time win-
ningest class in school history,
collecting.117 victories.

Pitt entered the contest having
won 10 of its last 12 games. The
Panthers started with intensity,
scoring the ﬁrst run in the third
inning off an infield base hit from
senior Ashley Amistade.

A Pitt junior Ciera Damon
started the inning by breaking

. Syracuse pitcher Jenna Caira’s
no—hitter with a single. Then
Amistade drove in Pinch runner
Jessica Rhodunda. _

“We knew that we were facing
a. good pitcher in Caira,” Amista-
de said. “She has a good change-
up that we had to be ready for,
and Ciera was able to connect

myvith one on her hit.”
‘ I ""3. ,.

-3' __,,Vﬂ;ile Dgmon was aware of
 ,  3' s‘*‘m
‘Caira’s dorm-nance, she was fo-

cused on only her individual 

bat in the third inning. ,
“I didn’t even know that Caira
had not yet given up a hit,” Da-
mon said. “I.was just concentrat-
ing on my time at the plate and
trying to get on base_to generate
offense.”
The single run almost carried the
team to victory, but even the Pan-
ther defense and the pitching of
senior Alyssa O’Connell couldn’t
' hold off the Orange -offense.
Amistade said that protecting a

one-run lead is difﬁcult.

“It’s always better to have a
lead than to be trailing,” Amis-
tade said. “This time, though,
one run just wasn’t enough.”

Head coach Holly Aprile
agreed, noting that in a low-scor-
ing game, the margin for error is
extremely low. a ,

. “Our team is comfortable with‘
a lead, but a 1-0 lead is tough,”
Aprile said. “You never want to

I sit back and be satisfied with that
‘ one run and you have to be nearly

perfect defensively and from the

' , After three hits and six score-

less innings, the Orange ﬁnally
found their rhythm against
O’Connell and generated two
runs in the seventh inning that
secured the win and advanced
Syracuse in the Big East Cham-"
pionships. -

The meeting between the Pan-
thers and the Orange was their

a first of the year, -as the teams

didn’t face each other in the 2011
regular season. The Panthers did
not consider that worrisome.
“We felt going into this game ,
that we were well-prepared and
ready to face any team,” Damon
said. “We had a few tough breaks
in the seventh, but we played;
hard.” ’ L
Aprile felt that her team ex-
ecuted its game plan well despite
the loss and showed improve-
ment from previous seasons.
“For the most part, we were
successful in our strategy against‘
Syracuse, getting out to an early

Pitt’s five seniors — Amis-

COLUMN

NCAA Tournament tops t

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

It doesn’t get much better than this_ time of year
for sports fans, with the NHL and NBA playoffs
providing spectacularly exciting games on a
nightly basis. '

A few nights ago, as I watched one of the
20 incredible Stanley Cup playoff overtime
games from this year, a question popped into
my head: Which sport boasts the best post-
season? C

After much contemplation and debate, I
present here my top—ﬁve most exciting post-
season tournaments in all of college and pro-
fessional sports.

5. FIFA World Cup

 Now before you shake your head at the
mentioning of soccer as an exciting sport,
remember the events of last summer’s World

‘ Cup. LandonsDonovan’s goal in the United

States’ last group stage match, which was one
of the best‘ moments from’the World Cup that
year, led to massive celebrations among mil-
lions of American sports fans and proved that a
1~o soccer match can be exciting. Beyond that,
the World Cup makes the list because no sport
is better designed for drama than soccer. Since
matches are typically lowscoring, each play
can change the game’s outcome. That makes
World Cup soccer quite the spectacle.

4. NBA Playoff's A

Although professional basketball’s
postseason.hasn’t been the same since the
days of Michael Jordan, it’s starting to re-
turn to the excitement level of the ’90s.

Although star-studded teams like the Mi- ,

ami Heat, Boston Celtics and Los Angeles
Lakers might make the regular season seem

NFL playoffs could miss this list. The Super
Bowl may be the mecca of U.S. sports, but the
earlier rounds of football’s playoffs have been
known to provide some spectacular moments
as well. The single-elimination style means
that not many sporting events can match the
drama of the NFL playoffs. It would be nice
if college football could follow in the NFL’s
successful footsteps and produce a playoff

It would be nice if college football
could follow in the NFL” s successful  
footsteps and produce a playoff system

of its hwn.

irrelevant, these teams are also the reason the
NBA playoffs are so exciting. The ridiculous

levels of athleticism among the players make .

every game entertaining. Wheniteams actually
decide to play defense and make the games
close, the NBA playoffs can be a joy to watch.

3. NFL Playoffs
» Withfootball currently the most popular
sport in the United States, there’s no way the

system of its own.

2. NHL Playoffs

No championship is harder to win, which
is probably why the Stanley Cup is the biggest
and most coveted trophy in sports. Hockey
players play through more pain and injuries
than any other athletes, and they don’t get
days or weeks between games. There’s some-
thing uniquely entertaining about watching

he list of best playoffs

men with full beards skating around 
taking punishment for two months during’
the playoffs. Playoff hockey’s intangible “it”
factor and the desperation the players show
in overtime — and even regulation —— make
the NHL playoffs almost the best postseason
in all of sports.
1. NCAA men’s "Basketball Tournament

In my opinion, there’s no arguing with this
one: March Madness is as good as it gets. Every
year, millions of Americans, who may or may
not be basketball fans, ﬁll out brackets and
tune in to the NCAA Tournament with the hope
of seeing their team — or their bracket — go
all the way. Like football, the single-elirni-
nation style is conducive to dramatic games
and the sheer number of games in the NCAA
Tournament greatly increases the possibility
that each round will have several exciting ﬁn-

. ishes. March Madness is also unique in thaflﬁ‘

might be the only postseason inwhich the ﬁrst
round is typically just as or even more exciting
than the last. Thrilling from beginning to end,
this basketball tournament captivates millions
each year and is the main reason why so many
sports fans look forward to March.

So there they are —— the best playoffs in
American sports..

Whether or not you agree with my choices,
there’s no debating that sports fans can’t wait
for their favorite playoffs to come around. I
