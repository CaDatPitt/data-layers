Calendar For
The Engineers

Social events for the remainder

decided and for the present remains
un-named. This appointment will be
made later. According to Miss Ber-
land the Spring Festival Dance is
scheduled for the original date. At
the meeting, the committee also
heard the report of the Freshman

~ Dance committee who will sponsor

Parking Prohibited
On Cathedrars
Boulevard Side

Sixty or more studentand fac-
ulty drivers were given parking
violation tags last week. They had
failed to notice “No Parking”
signs on the Bigelow Boulevard
parking space between Fifth Ave-
nue and Forbes Street. The park-
ing signs had been put up by the
police department last Saturday
at the request of University offi-
cials. This former parking space
is needed by the Air Corps detach-'
ment for marching and drilling
formation ground.

The inconspicuous position of
the signs is blamed for the unin-
tentional illegal parking of the
car owners. However, there is to
be no parking on Bigelow Boule-
vard until further notice.

Qceeézi 147/Lee

By BOB PAGE
When the historic December 7

"of 1941 was a “yesterday” in the
minds of Americans, each and
everyone of us began to pull in
our belts a few notches and dig
down deeper in our pockets in
preparation for a long determined
push to help the government win
the war against the axis p0WeI’S-

To the Pitt campus came accel-
eration, summer school, enlistments
in the Army, Navy, and Marine
reserves, and a complete change 1n
its extra curricular activities, both
social and otherwise.

Fraternities at the University,
which depend on a certain quota
of men to keep their ﬁgures off of
the red side of the ledger, have
had to change their" status in many
ways.

In many houses the monthly
charge for men who live at the
fraternity has been reduced, in or-
der that many of the “-town” men
could take advantage of living at
the ‘house. For the “Greeks” must
have many men living in the

- house to keep up with the expenses

that it incurs.

The usual three meals a day of-
fered at the houses, in many cases,
have been reduced to only one or
two. This was the result of the in-

. creased rationing program carried

Sn by all stores, it being harder to
obtain enough food to provide an
ample meal for the men.

A 7 Q Already the “frat” men speak of
T7}. the absence of those fellows that
 have been called to the armed ser-

vices. They miss the big gangs at
Monday meeting nights, the noisy
larger crowds at the Saturday
night dances, and the overcrowded
ping pong room during a “big
game” between the house champs.
It is very common to walk into
a house now and ﬁnd just a few
fellows sitting around instead of the
usual larger numbers. The houses
now ring with emptiness instead of
laughing boisterous voices.

In the many Tuck shop booths
where fraternity men are easy to
ﬁnd, one can sometimes hear dis-
cussions on “closing the house” for
the duration, or “should we store
our furniture or sell it.” “Should
we junk that old pool table or try
to sell it to someone.” The out-
come of these questions we don’t
know but in the next few months
we can expect to see many more
fraternities going off campus till
“after the war.”

Phi Kappa, Sigma Alpha Mu,
and Theta Chi have already gone
off campus until after the war, at
which time they will reorganize,
and come back with all their “rush-
ing parties” dances, and social af-
fairs.

The end of this story we cannot
predict but we can see an increase
in fraternity men after the war.
How each fraternity will re-orient
itself to the new university life
after the War we cannot say, but
knowing that they are a deﬁnite
part of Pitt life we know that they
will come- back with the old vigor
and enthusiasm that is typical of

lndians Present
Views on lndia

Tonight the Pittsburgh Branch
of the Foreign Policy Association
will present a much debated issue
in its twelfth annual series of dis-
cussions, “India Today.”

At 8:15 o’clock in Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial, T. A. Raman and
Dr. Anup Singh will present their
views on the issue. University stu-
dents are invited to attend. "

Mr. Raman, a member of an
old Hindu Brahmin family, was
educated at the University of
Madras and ‘London and has
meen in journalistic work in both
India and England. He is a mem-
ber of India’s Congress Party
and is in close contact with of-
ﬁcial opinion in India. Mr. Ra-
man is known for his, strong
right-wing Congress views and
is a persistent and able advocate
in Britain of Indian self-deter-
mination. He represents the con-
servative side of the issue.

Dr. Singh, the Indian National-
ist, is a native‘ of India and was
, educated there, but, also holds a
doctorate in political science from
Harvard University. He is at pres-
ent the Director of the Research
_Bureau of the India League of
America and editor of “India To-

Greek Students
Honor Holiday

Greek students at the University
commemorated Greek independence
Day yesterday. Because of the
war there was no meeting to cele-
brate the occasion, but there were
white ﬂowers in the Greek Na-
tionality Room.

Just one hundred twenty-two
years ago Greece rose against her
bondage to the Turks and fought
for six years against a nation
twenty-ﬁve times her own number.

Today Greece is a conquered
country, but her defeat is only
temporary for her spirit will never
die. It is this spirit, together with
a faith in America and the other
Allied Nations, that brings hope
to the Greeks of today that they
will again enjoy the blessings of,
self-government they so richly de-
serve.

Army-Navy Tests
Are Scheduled

Place of the army and navy
specialist tests has been shifted
from Carnegie Tech to Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial. Both tests
are to be given on April 2 and
in the banquet hall of the Me-
lmorial.

Latest wire from the Third
Service Command has widened the
eligibility of students who may
take the tests. Freshmen and soph-
omores in the Marine Corps Re-
serve will take the test and it is
believed that all naval reservists
except V-1's will take it. Army en-
listed reserve corps men are also
advised to take it.

The wire from the Service Com-
mand reads as follows: “Enlisted
Reserve Corps Students are eligi-
ble to participate in the joint
army-navy qualifying test April
2nd and should be urged to do so.
Students taking test should clearly
indicate enlisted reserve corps
status on answer sheet.”

Sophs Plan Get-Together
Sophomore girls will sponsor a
get-to-gether today at 3:30 o’clock
in Stephen Foster Memorial. Tick-
ets, which cost 15 cents, may be
purchased from any member of the
committee. Committee members are
easily identified by corsages of
.various colored ﬂowers which they
have been wearing all week.

For Athletic

And Musical Equipment

Wednesday, Thursday and Fri-
day of next week have been set
aside for the collection of athletic
equipment, and musical instru-
ments to be sent to war prisoners
by the Campus branch of the War
Prisoners Recreation ‘Committee.

Although the city—wide drive is
due to begin on the ﬁrst of May,
the Pitt drive has been moved up
one day in order that as many stu-
dents as possible may contribute.

Chairmaned by Elaine Kahn,
C44, the committee includes
members of the athletic depart-
ment, the faculty, and various
student leaders. The committee
seeks all usable athletic and-
musical goods that the prisoners
in the camps could use. These
prisoners include internees, ref-
ugees, and actual prisoners of
war.

The equipment will be delivered
to the prisoners under the provi-
sions of the Geneva conference
which gave the Red Cross and the
_YM.C_A -a_c.o_e.s,s to ‘prisoners ' .t..h.e

   

  

  

camps.

Space has been secured on Red
Cross transport ships which as-
sures the delivery of the goods.
The ships are also reported to have
special spot lights on them” in or-
der that they may be clearly dis-
tinguished from the other ships.

More than any other material.
things, men in prison want athletic
goods and musical instruments.
These articles can no longer be
purchased, as scarcity of materials
has stopped the manufacture of
most items. Hence it is up to the
civilians to clean out their closets

and provide those prisoners with ‘ A

the means by which they can fill

the long hours behind barbed wire.
“The main thing about this
campaign,” announced Miss
Kahn, “is that it doesn’t cost
you anything. Here is your

chance to get rid of the things V

that have been cluttering your
closet and also to help those 
fortunate prisoners of war at the

te champion for the mile and
mile. His short, powerful legs
uld be well suited for the in-
or boards.
I Tommy Carr, another All-State
Lhamp from Mt. Lebanon, has
° 11 invited to compete in’ the In-
ational sprint classic. Carr has
.en accustomed to running the
' .es. but has never tried one

 
   
    

 
 
 
  
 

  
 
  
  

 

 
 
   

 
 
  

as short asthe 45-yard dash. But
if his starting improvement shows
anything, he will be sure to be up
for the finals. L b

He has the necessary early speed
which is all important in this trace
and he should be the. first indi-
vidual victor of the Pitt indoor
season.. , _ .

Incidentally, the track coach
himself received an invitation to
participate in the meet, but an
A‘AU ruling which forbids those
coaching the sport to participate
in the meets, will relegate him
merely to the role of an extremely
interested spectator. P V '

This will be the first test for
the war ravaged track team and
will also serve as a kind of pre-
view of the Penn relays. The boys
had been practicing for a month
and a half on the up and down in-
door track behind Trees gym. It
will be a great novelty for most

of them to be able to sink their

spiker into a board track without
having to run "around army ob-
stacle courses to get to the ﬁnish
line.

Outdoor practice for the track
team will begin Monday following
the return of the Cleveland out-
ﬁt. The ﬁrst outdoor meet on the
schedule will be the Penn. Relays
at Philadelphia April 23.

Diamond Drills Outdoors

Baseball drills this ‘week were
highlighted chieﬂy by the "appear-
ance of photographers from the
downtown papers and ‘the,'continu-
ed presence of Big Max Butcher,
the Pirate holdout, at the prac-
tice sessions. ' “

With the Pirates training in
Muncie, Indiana, where the snow
is reported to be ﬁve inches deep,
Big? Max seems to have the advan-
tage all over his more easily sat-
isﬁed. teammates.

The weathermanhas been co-
operating-beautifully with the Pitt
baseballers and Butcher has insti-
tuted. his own training program
which includes} running, walking
and ‘ sitting around the Stadium

track. Thus, according to him, he

has all the advantages of spring

. training without the disadvantages

of having a tough manager super-
vising’ that training.

With one eye on the weather and
the other on" his squad, Coach Mit-
te-rling is awaiting beginning of the
outdoor drills. It is warm enough
to begin outdoors, but the ground
is still too damp to be played on.

Letterman hurler Bill McKee is

Sets Principles for Students:

“Communique,” wartime information pamphlet for Stu-
dent Christian work, has brought forth many new ideas for
better student cooperation on college campuses. They set forth
principles which will be useful in student relations with the
'.Armed Forces.

Representatives of the several student religious organ-

izations present found themselves to be in complete agreement
on the following points:

1. The responsibility of the
groups now functioning on
American campuses to continue
their work both for military and
civilian members of_ their con-
stituencies. ~

2. Desirability of each group
represented to seek to establish
mutually satisfactory and help-
ful working agreements with
their related organizations in
USO.

3. Any cooperation with the
USO (or its member agencies)
in the college ﬁeld should be
through the regular channels of
existing organizations operating
in -the colleges, i.e., Newman
Clubs, B’Nai B’Rith Hillel Foun-
dations, National Federation of
Catholic College Students, stu-
dent YMCA’s, student YWCA’s,
(the ’latter cooperating with Pro-
testant Church groups through
the War Emergency Council on
Student Christian Work).

sirable to meet USO representa-
tives for a united consideration of
college religious work, the repre-
sentatives here will welcome such
an opportunity.

Volumes Added,
To Collection

Two new books have been added
to the Alldred room during the
past week. One of these is Richard
Tresaske’s “Guadalcanal Diary”
which tells with reality the story
of the Marines on Guadalcanal. In
this story there is no rhetorical
trimming or outbreak of sentiment.
It is a clear-cut account of the
ﬁght that the Marines are stag-
ing, as seen by a correspondent
who was one of them.
