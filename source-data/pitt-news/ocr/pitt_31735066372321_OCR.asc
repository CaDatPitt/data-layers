No Stickney Ruling.

County Coroner Sanford Edberg
ruled Friday that he is unable to
determine whether Stonewall Mor-
gan Stickney. a 24-year old Pitt stu-
dent. committed suicide or died in
an accidentalfallfromthe Cathedral
of Learning.

Edberg reached his conclusion
after listening to the testimony of
police. university officials. students.
and the coroner’s chief toxicologist
Dr. Charles Winek. at an open
inquest last week held to determine
the cause of Stickney‘s death.

Winek said that Stickney had an

i extremely high level of Methaquaa-

lone in his system when he died. -*
Accordingto Winek. it is difficult to
imagine that Stickney could have
formed a plan to commit suicide
while he had such a large amount of
the depressant in his body.

Winek said_ that Stickney may
have been thinking about suicide.
but was probably not awarcthat he
was carrying out such a plan when
he died.

The coroner’s office had pre-
viously ruled out the possibility of
homicide. and at the conclusion of
last week’s inquest. absolved Pitt of
negligence in the case.

Throughout the inquest. Edberg

A attempted to tie Stickney’s death to

at larger drug problem at Pitt. He

asked most witnesses for their opin- A

ions regarding the use of illegal
drugs at Pitt. but was consistently
itold that no real problem existed.»

A Winek said that he did not think
there was.a specific problem with
drug abuse at Pitt. but that the use of
non-lethal drugs, such as Metha-
quaalone. marijuana, and alcohol,
was known to be a problem at many
high schools and colleges.

Winek’s testimony suggested that
Stickney was addicted to Metha-

quaalone. He said that -abuse of the

drug could produce “semi—psychotic
behavior”. such that which was.

Sagan Talks About Where We All Began

By PEGGY FERRI

’“We hunger to know where we
come from.”

Those were the words of Dr. Carl
Sagan, scientist, writer and host of
Cosmos, the widely acclaimed tele-
vision series, as he lectured Friday at
Carnegie Institute.

Sagan’s lecture focused on the

origin of life on Earth and on find-"

ings of the recent Viking and
Voyager explorations of the Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn systems. He also
addressed the question of “whether
there are any clues in the outer solar
system as to how we got here.”
“Human beings have been around
for one million years and our destiny
is clearly somewhat precarious, but
it’s also within our hands, within our
power, to control, "' Sagan said.
“And the lesson of the dinosaur
should be very clear to us-—mainly
that no one has a guarantee ofindef-
inite continuance as a species."
Sagan said he believes life origi-
nated‘ before 3'/2 billion years ago.

V The Earth, on the other hand, is

about 4'/2 billion years old, accord-
ing to Sagan.

“The origin of life took at most a
few hundred million years, and so it
had to be very fast,” Sagan said.

“ ‘Six Days‘ was once a popular
hypothesis and is not excluded by
this data. On the other hand, there’s
not a smidgen of evidence that it
happened that fast."

Humans are made up of two
molecules, nucleic acids and pro-
teins, Sagan explained. Nucleic
acids, DNA and RNA, are the re-
positories of information and the
blueprints on how to make another
being.

The proteins are molecular
machines that carry out the instruc-
tions coded in the nucleic acids and
convert them into action. They are
made up of only six elements: car-
bon. oxygen, nitrogen, phosphor-
ous, sulfur and hydrogen.

“The universe is made almost
entirely of hydrogen, butnot so for
Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury and
the moon,” Sagan said. “The gravity
is so low on Earth that any initial
‘hydrogen we may have had has
escaped into space——not the case
with Jupiter, Saturn or the sun. So it
is at least plausible that the Earth
formed out of some common cosmic
stuff."

Sagan then posed the question,
“What happens if, in an experiment,
you bottle methane, ammonia and
water (then present on early Earth)

A

and spark it up?" He answered that
. such an experiment had been per-
formed in the l950s and, “as‘-a
remarkable result, out dropped
some of the fundamental building
blocks of life, the amino acids.
“The remarkable aspect of all this

 

is that there is nothing unique to the
Earth in it," Sagan said. “The mate-
rials are the most common in the
universe. and any energy source
which breaks the chemical bonds
will permit this stuffto exist. There-
fore, it suggests that the stuff oflife.
if not life itself, ought to be virtually
everywhere.”

The lecture included a look at
what Sagan called his “pretty pic-
tures" from the recent Viking and
Voyager explorations.

“The outer solar system," Sagan
said while showing the pictures. "is a
great place to lool<~ - it‘s cold. stuffis
preserved. there are massive objects
out there that retain hydrogen and
hydrogen compounds to this day.
and also because we have just fin-

ished a most remarkable and histori-

cal sequence of exploratory
missions.”

Sagan presented his views on the
following planets based on data
from the Viking and Voyager mis-
sions: Q

0 Mars: “This planet has ancient
river valleys, which are evidence for
an epoch about a billion years ago
when water flowed on the Martian
surface. Mars today is bone-dry.
Temperature and pressure are so
low that liquid water cannot exist.

“There is not a singfe organic ‘
molecule in a billion molecules of
Martian soil. We do not understand
why Mars is so lacking in organic
molecules when two ofits moons are
composed of nothing else but
organic molecules."

0 Jupiter: lo, its innermost moon.
revealed the first active volcanoes
outside of Earth, according to
Sagan. lo is also covered with frozen
sulfur that has welled up from an
underground ocean of liquid sulfur.

0 Saturn: One hypothesis about 
Saturn is that the coloration of its ‘
surface is due to the presence of
organic molecules, Sagan said. The
atmosphere there is also similar to
the atmosphere ofthe early Earth. In
addition. Titan, one of Satum’s
moons. is preserved inithe cold ofthe
outer solar system and possesses a
very rich array of the same kind of
molecules which four billion years
ago led on our planet tothe origin of
life. '

“lt‘appears," Sagan said, “that the
chemistry of which we are made.
broadly speaking. is a cosmic com-
monplace and reminds us that we
ourselves, our nature, our fate. are
profoundly tied up with the,
cosmos.” «

 'l’’'‘., I:

:2 a C ‘c'»

By IJNDA MILLER

“The debate is trivial. We are not
asking a basic point-that is-why are
we sending AWACs to Saudi
Arabia?” .

The statement above was not

‘made by a U.S. Senator at last
week’s Senate» hearing on the pro-
posed sale of Airborne Warning and
Control System (AWACs) planes to.
Saudi Arabia, but rather by a well-
known Pitt professor speaking on
U.S. foreign policy before a small
group of students and faculty
Wednesday.‘ I

“The operating scenario behind
'the AWAC situation is based on the
notion that‘ the Soviet Union
appears in the Persian Gulfarea and
either interdicts Saudi Arabian oil
shipments or bombs its airfields."
said Dr. Richard Cottam, a political
science professor at Pitt. “Why it

 

happens is not addressed in this sce-
nario. nor is the question of what
happens later on."

These facts, in addition to the fact
that AWACS can only watch an
attack. makes the operating scenario
“vulnerable” and “lunatic” in

'_ nature. according to Cottam. He

also said that the Saudis have admit-
ted that their only reason for want-
ing the planes is to guard aginst their
primary enemy. Israel.

The Reagan administration's per-
ception of the Soviet Union is an
important underlying factor in the

I push lfor sale of the AWACs as well

.as the operating scenario. S
“The current administration has
regressed back to the l95()s. misper—
ceiving communism very badly by
drawing the Hitler b2.:t"ier too
closely," said Cottam. who received
national attention when he visited
lranjust aftertIhe US. hostages were
taken. "The only ‘difference is that
this time we view China as a good
communist regime and not as ‘a
Soviet satellite." V
Cottam explained that the Rea-
gan administration plans to contain
the Soviet Union by developing an
extensive alliance system that begins
in China. goes through Pakistan,
then into Jordon, Oman. Israel,
Egypt and then to Morocco withthe
only gaps being Iran and Libya.
‘Not only is this “will and determi-
nation" policy unrealistic as third
world countries have started to real-
ize their own power, but it isTdanger-
ous, according to Cottam. U I
“WIe’re not doing countries a
favor by making them feel they’re
secure iftheiy’re in the embrace ofthe
United States. On the contrary.

they’re insecure because they're liv— .

ing an illusion. he said. “The third
world is not powerless and thevdays
inwhieh the United States couldrun

in and knock off governments are*

over.” .

Cottam referred ‘to lessons
learned-in Iran to support several
points made in his speech. I ,_,

“The lesson Ronald Reagan
seems to have learned from Iran.
that being without will and determi-
nation your best enemies will fall. is
not the essential one,” says Cottam.
“The lesson to be learned from Iran-
one that I think very few have
learned-is that we are entering an era
of mass politics. The third world
population is becoming more
politically-oriented and we can no
longer afford to overextend our-
selves in these countries without
paying heavy consequences in our
own society?’

To further substantiate his point
about the power of the third world.
Cottam used an interesting example.

“At the same time it had control of
52 Americans. Iran took the lead in a
conference condemning the Soviet
Union invasion of Afghanistan," he
explained. “Furthermore. it has
given support or and refuge to
600,000 Afghanistans. How about
that‘? A country with a I600-mile
border with the Soviet Union and no
army takes on both super powers at
the same time."

In addition to ‘completing his
undergraduate degree at the Univer-
sity of Utah and his graduate degree
at Harvard University. Cottam stud-
ied in Iran from I951-I952 as a Full-
bright Scholar. He then worked as a
political officer at the U.S. embassy
in Tehra-n from I956-I958 before

. joining the" Pitt faculty in l959_.a

“Cottam has written severalbooks

I on the, Middle“ East, including».

; sidered bygsome tobe next inil.i_Inefor

have done the American public a »

great disservice in their coverage of

foreign countries allied tothe United
States according to Cottam.

“Our journalists are failing us
badly with romanticized stories of

Iour allies." he says. “Most reporters

do not develop a deep understand-
ing of countries outside of Western
Europe. “There is very little willing-
ness to write critical analyses of
governments friendly to the United
States."

According to Cottam. a US. cor-
respondent who writes an honest.
in-depth criticism on the questiona-
ble practices ofa country allied with
the United States not only risks
being expelled from that country.
but in most cases. will receive very
little support from the US. govern-
ment.

“Major U.S. newspapers. such as
the New York Timc.s' and the
Washington Pm‘! have done quite
badly in making the public suffi-
ciently aware of the third world
countries." says Cottam. “They have
taken short—cuts, such as applying
the work word “pro-west’ to any U.S.
ally and by focusing only on those
aspects of a country that are in
accordance with U.S. philosophical
beliefs. In the long-run this has given
us a sense of misguided patriotism.“

The paralysis ofthis country’s lib- .

eral faction in providing alternatives
to our foreign policy is another
bothersome element according to
Cottam. _ _. _

Lectures To Explor

By MIKE MALLINGER

Carnegie Museum of Natural His-
tory and Gulf Oil Corp. have
launched a series of lectures that will
explore solutions to the energy
problem. '

The lecture series titled “Search
_for Solutions: Energy Research.“
began last Thursday and will con-

tinue weekly through Nov. I9. The

talks will cover a gamut of research-

0 oriented topics, ranging from a his-

torical development of oil
exploration techniques to current
research in transportation fuels.
.Carnegie‘s Learning Museum
Program. through which the lecture

-series has been organized, seeks to

bring together the public and busi-
ness community to share informa-
tion of a scientific and technical
nature. Organizers of “Search for
Solutions: Energy Research" said
the series will accomplish that goal
by tapping Gulf‘s expertise in
research areas and matching it with
public concern about the present
and future direction of petroleum
price and availability.

ducts Don Kendrick. who willspeak
at the Nov. l9 lecture. said in an
interview last week that prices for all
petroleum products are bound to
increase. He added. however. that
petroleum availability would be

maintained through transactions.
with suppliers throughout the
world.

Kendrick said he hoped the lee-
ture series would heighten consumer
awareness of peripheral issues con-
nected with the petroleum industry.
One ofﬂthose peripheral areas is the

I price oil‘ companies ask for their

products.
Petroleum prices are likely to

. increase due to lower-quality crudes

now being_purchased by oil compan-
ies. Kendrick said. These crudes.
which contain high amounts of sul-
fur. are more difficult to process.

“Our intent and our effort is to
develop the processing that’s neces-
sary to produce highpquality lube
oils as we have in the past." said
Kendrick.

Conventional sources ofdomestic
crude are drying--up, Kendrick said.

content. Kendrick said alterations
are under way at Gulf‘s Port Arthur
refinery to accommodate the lower
quality oil that the company pur-
chases from west Texas and
Venezuela. ' »

Gulf may also purchase heavy
African crude in the future. accord-
ing to Kendrick.

Little of Gulf‘s oil comes from the
Middle East. he said.

Gulf researchers are spending
much of their time developing
synthetic-based lubricants. Ken-
drick said.

“They are still made from the bar-
rel. but they are man-made mole-
cules that are much more stable than
conventional. crude-derived mole-
cules,“ he added.

Synthetics may someday replace

since they resist oxidation at high
temperatures and remain fluid at
very low temperatures.

These products are “on the shelf."
according to Kendrick. available
whenever the marketing department
wants to sell those products.

Kendrick projected “that the
internal combustion engine is still
going to be the predominant power
plant by the year 2000.“ referring to
diesel and gasoline engines. He
downplayed competition from alter-
native designs. such as the turbine or
Sterling engines.

Demand for gasoline. he said. will
drop off inthe future to 5.2 million
barrels a day from the present six
million barrels.

There will be more cars. but they

will be more energy-efficient cars
with smaller engin‘es...so the ulti-
mate effect is a decrease in the
demand for gasoline,” Kendrick
said.

Still. he maintained. the United
States will be dependent on foreign
oil. '

Enhanced recovery methods will
ease the burden by using steam and

detergents to squeeze more oil out of

oldfields. he said. freeing more ofthe
oil that previously was uneconomi-

CGS Guild Studies Communications

By BONNIE E. THOMPSON

Student interest and the broad
array of resources available at Pitt
will cause the university to become
more communications-oriented. An
early step in this process was the
establishment ofthe College ofGen-
eral Studies’ Communications
Guild.

“The creation ofthe guild is one of
the most positive steps in that direc-
tion.“ Dr. Ray Steele. Pitt’s asso-
ciate provost, said at the guild’s
awards dinner last Thursday.

“It is meaningful and indicative of
the future concerning communica-
tions and of the student industry
available here." according to Steele.
“The creation ofthe guild is one of

the most positive steps in that direc-_

tion," Steele continued. The first of
its kind at Pitt. “they are meaningful
and indicativeofthe future concern-
ing communications and of the stu-
dent industry available here." he
said. ~ I »-
Established less than a year ago.
the guild‘s objective. according to
Chairman Alex Danenberg. “ is to

provide an invaluable atmosphere

outside the classroom where com-
municators can learn about the
practical aspect of their field.”
Although the group originated in
the College of General Studies,
membership is also open to students

_in the College of Arts and Sciences

who are interested in the communi-
cations field.

“One of the major goals of the .

st

guild.” Danenberg said. is to
expose people to professional com-
municators’ and their organiza-
tions." Activities thus far have
included hosting various speakers in
"the field. touring WQED and hold-
ing a writing competition for which
the dinner was held. A
A $200 cash prize was awarded to
CGS studentAlana Pickren for her
essay “Kangaroo Hunt." which won
first place. Kirk Mechlin. the second
place winner. received $100 for his
paper “entitled “Analytical Frame-
works in Administration and l.aw:
The DES Decision." Both papers,
which had been classroom assign-
ments. were chosen from a field of 35
and will be published in the

V

November edition of Night Times. .

“Nothing is more important to a
communicator than the ability to
write." emphasized Steele. “Writing:
skills are at the core ofbeing success-
ful in this field." Sharon Fleming.
the competition committee chairwo-
man. added, “I think what we‘ve
accomplished is important and this
is only the beginning.” reflecting the
organization’s hope that this
alumni-sponsored. contest ._will
become an annual event.

Additional guests in all facets of
the communications field ranging
from sales. public relations and
advertising to television and radio.

are planned for the future. The guild"

has established affiliations with the
International Association of Busi-
ness Communications and the Inter-

national Radio and Television
Society. and periodically offers
internships.

“The net result of this exposure‘
between industry. faculty and stu-
dents will enable us to build contacts

and credibility.“ Steele said. “We're .

opening up a network of profes-
sional people who encourage others
and help them, to get started." he
explained. A

Hopeful that CAS will recognize.

as CGS already has. the potential in"

the communications field. Steele
\ commented. “communications have
been neglected at our university.
Perhaps now through the guild "we
will be able to do more. faster.“

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Thirty years after the horror and
the crime. memories and hatred still
burn deep within the hearts of cer-
tain Jews. Some have chosen to
forget the atrocities. but others are
driven by an obsession to wipe out
legacy of the Na7i regime. Simon
Wiesenthal is one of these Jews.

Simon Wiesenthal is the hunter
and Nazi war criminals are the
hunted in a hour-longdocumentary.
The Hunter and The Hunted which
will air on Wed..Oct 2l. WQ_F.l)—'l‘V
edited its version narrated by Jose
Ferrar. from an hour-and a—half.

Wiesenthal. a former prisoner at
the Mauthausen concen-tration
camp. has his headquarters in Aus-
tria. where he is the founder anfd
director of the Jewish Documenta-
tion Center. Wiesenthal stalks Na’/i

the world. but he has always eluded
them. Wiesenthal reports that Men-
gele is living somewhere in South
America. probably Paraguay.

The horror of Megele‘s work are
explicitly shown in the film.
Obsessed with “racial superiority".
Mengele performed gruesome
experiments shooting dye into

children‘s eyes. transforming men’

into women on his prisoners.
Second on Wiesenthal‘s list is
Klaus Barbie. Barbie. nicknamed
“The Butcher of l.yon.”iis living in
South America under the alias of
Klaus Altmann. Barbie has been
granted Bolivian citizenship and a
filmed interview with Barbie reveals
that he receives police protection.
Efforts by Beate Klarsfield and her
husband Serge to extradite Barbie
have failed repeatedly. Barbie has

been positively identified by his fin-
gerprints. identification experts and
a journalist. .

Wiesenthal's obsession reflects a
philosophy that keeps the 72-year-
old former prisoner going. 1

“When history looks back. want
people to know that the Nazis wer-t
en‘t able to kill ll million people and
get away with it.“ lt’s been overthree
decades since o million Jews per-
ished due to the Nazis “Final Solu-
tion”. but for “Hunter" Simon
Wiescnthal that doesn‘t matter.

“I can forgive only crimes com-
mitted against me personally. but l
am not authorized to forgive for oth-
ers." he said. '

Simon Wiesenthal will never for-
give or forget the horror of Ausch-

nervous person like my mother-~she
is very nervous and high strung. I
think I was born real nervous.”

At the Home she had the comfort
of being with her sisters. although
her younger sister constantly got
into trouble and gave the blame to
Elizabeth.

“I got the beatings for all her stuff,
or we both got blamed for other peo-
ple‘s stuff. Once we both got 50¢. so
we bought our mother a little plant
for Mother's Day and the nuns
thought we stole it. Some other kids
stole one, but we got blamed. -When
we got punished, they used a big
strap. It really hurt."

The Catholic Home was a facility
for young children; when Elizabeth
became an adolescent, she was
placed in a detention home for girls.
“I never knew why they put me in
there, because it was a home for bad
girls. and I wasn’t bad.” she said.

birthdays."

At age 20. Elizabeth was placed
on “parole”and lived and worked in
a nursing home for a year before
being absolved of her “crimes“.

In I973 her family helped her get
into a transitional living program.

“They didn't want me to move in ’

with them. we didn’t get along. and I
needed a place to stay. There they
taught us how to live on our own; we
learned to cook. budget money. and
things like that."

It was during this time that Eliza-
beth had her first nervous break-
down and had to be hospitalized. “I
guess a lot of the trouble was
because people were ‘starting’ on
me. I tried to help my roommate and
then she turned on me. My nerves
have always been bad and ljust can't
take a lot of pressure on me. I was
pretty unhappy then.”

Elizabeth had another breakdown
a few years later. and has since been
an outpatient at Western Psych.

‘‘I’m always afraid that I’ll have to
go back into the hospital. I didn‘t
used to notice when my nerves were
getting bad but now I can tell. like
right now they‘re getting bad

Elizabeth receives medication
that helps her maintain stability. “I
take a pill in the morning. one at 4
p.m.. and one that helps me to sleep.
If I don‘t take the one at night. I
don’t get to sleep because I hear voi-
ces and bells and typewriters typing.
I hear all kinds ofstuffat night, and I
have awful nightmares.”

Her daysiare filled with trips down
the street to do laundry, to buy a few
things she needs for her apartment.
or to visit friends in the lounge at
People’s Oakland.

In the lounge she chats with other
outpatients. ’They worry together
about how much their food stamps
will be cut and what they will do if
their Public Assistance is stopped.

The lounge is a place where
friends are. where people under-
stand. a place to go when she feels
alone. Although she enjoys the feel-
ing of being self-sufficient. it is com-
forting to know the lounge is there.

At home in her meticulously clean
attic apartment. she smiles sweetly
and talks of her past apartments and
of their roaches. rats and crime.

She worries about the future. the
past. and about having to go back to
the hospital. She worries about
Christmas. what she will receive and
where she will go.

Devoid of regret and self-pity. she
worries little about whether she is
happy or sad. She isisatisfied that
she has survived the day and will be
independent and selfisufficient

where it's very hard to get unani-

ple still think that the Health Center
will be providing more parking than
they need.” said Sandra Phillips.

president of OD].

Phillips emphasized that ODl
based its approval of the expansion
on parking issues and their effect on
the neighborhood. not on questions

of health care delivery.

The Number Four Block Club. a

' community group whose neighbor-
hood would be most heavily affected

by the expansion, wants the plan-
ning commission and City Council

to withhold approval until

the

Health Center can make assurances
that the group’s parking and traffic

concerns will be met.

“Our concern is with the amount
iof traffic that these garages would
generate. and the safety factor on the
street in terms of moving cars and
their effect on the many. kids we have
walking to and from school.” said
Art Young of- the Number Four

Block Club.

 ‘ The Block Club would recom-
‘” mendthatthe Health Center first go .
ahead with construction ofthe park-
ing area that would be located in the
new ambulatory care facility, then. if
necessary. go ahead with the con-
struction of a garage under the new
Eye and Ear Hospital. Finally. only
if absolutely necessary, should they
go ahead with the construction of a
smaller. version of the parking gar-
age at the corner of Terrace and

Darragh streets.

 In the spring of 1980. the Health
Center.had,..$.0ught to build a l.l20-
car'ga_rage"at that location. but was
rejected. because ofcommunity'con-

At the time. Councilman Robert
Radie Stone said the Health Center

had

“terrible credibility,” and

added: “I am at a loss at’ how an
institution can do anything it wants’
whether the community wants it or
not. , S
ODI approved the Health Center
expansion on three conditions:

0 That no use be made ofthe park-
ing lot currently at the corner of Ter-
race. and Darragh streets - without
ODI approval, and that its “use as a
parking lot during the construction
process of the next few years be
precluded”:

0 That agreements between the
Number Four Block Club and the
Health Center be kept. Those agree-
ments include: l

--—That neither the Health Cen-
ter nor any of its members attempt
to purchase any additional residen-
tial property;

-That during construction.

residential streets, and that adequate
parking be provided for construc-
tion personnel;

~—That traffic be routed as
much as

forced onto the residential streets;

—Th'at security be provided in
the parking garages. and that the
garages be used for parking during

That there be fair participa-

" tion of minority contractors in the

construction process.

0 And finally. that negotiations be
held between the city and the Health
Center to discuss funding for
im rovements to the streets between
Fi h and Centre Avenues. which
would‘ be affected by increased
traffic.

The Health Center is asking the
planning commission to rezone
some of its property on the south
side of Terrace Street between Dar-
ragh and Lothrop streets. from a
multiple-family residential area to
an institutional-civigc district.

The Health Center is also asking,
for a conditional use permit for con-
struction of the whole expansion.

Phillips said that. while there is
always a general question as to
whether or not the university should
expand at “such a great rate and in
such great amounts."theODl board
felt that most of its concerns had
been met.

Hotel Condominium Complex

As is the ‘case with the Health Cen-
ter expansion. Phillips said many of
ODl‘s concerns with the proposed.
hotel-condominium complex
behind the Syria Mosque center on
problems of parking and traffic
congestion.

She said the lots that are already
behind the Syria Mosque and the
Masonic Temple currently cost car
oawners about $20 per month. If the
complex is built. Phillips said. the
underground parking that might be
constructed may cost more than $70
a month. ’

“Where are they going to park?"
she asked.

“They’re going to drive to all the
other neighborhoods in Oakland
and look for free spots on the street
to park their cars. It willjust aggra-
vate all the parking problems." she
said.

Edward Smuts. project manager
for the complex. which would be
built by Bevnon Land Co.. said that

although all the feasibility studies
have been completed. the developer
was still not ready to make an
announcement of the final plans.

“Until we're ready to make some
sort ofa major outline on the scale of
the facility and some of these other
things, we really don't want to get
into any conversation on the sub-
ject.“ Smuts said.

Phillips said that ODI was also
considering the aesthetic impact that
the hotel_might have on the nearby
Schenley Farms neighborhood. and
on the lifestyle of that area.

“Can you really put up a gigantic
commercial establishment like that
right next to a single-family residen-

tial neighborhood‘? It's a beautiful.

ful. it’s well maintained-it‘s ajewel.

a Water- a

The Senate Counci.l’s recent watering-down of
its athlete attendence rule makes it even more
susceptible to criticism that the requirement was
unworkable and unfair in the first place. 4

The requirement, originally passed over the
summer, made it mandatory for first yearor aca-
demically troubled students (those who received

an “F,”the’previous term) to submit cards to their P

instructors at the end o.f each week beginning the
first week after the add/drop period ends.
period ends. .

The student must then submit the cardto-the .

athletic department at the end ofeach week. lfthe
student.doesn’t~ submit the card‘, or fails toattend
class regularly, he or she is then ineligible for
practice, competition or travel for a week.

, When the requirement was first passed, the
'S,enate‘Council congratulated itself on imposing
_ such a rigid requirement, which, it noted, sur-

passed standards of the ‘National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA).

The council could have also congratulated
itselfion approvinga proposal that looked respec-
table enough on paper, but \was unworkable in
practice. V

L The ways around the requirement were simple

_ and obvious at school where class enrollment

often exceeds 500; it doesn’t take a criminal mind
to realize how simple it would be to bypass the
requirement by strolling in a few minutes before
the end of class and having the card signed. lt was

‘also open” to question whetherforcingfa student. -

to attend class resulted in his actually learning
anything. _ , 

What was disturbing in the first proposal was
that the Senate "Council was presenting itself
genuinely interested in the problems of the stu-.
dent athlete, when, in fact, it wasn’t. If it was, it
could have recommended more counseling, aca-
demic programming, or other‘ special support
systems for athletes. ‘ - -

What is_even more disturbing about the recent
proposal—_that students with QPAS o-f_ 2.26,and
one F would be exempt-, and thoseywith l,o__w,er
QPAs be individually considered for

.exemption——is that weakens an already t0ot'.h_l.eSS .

proposal to the ‘point that it is completely
ineffective. T

I This recent move adds credibility  the  L

the the Hugh Greens of this world wouldn't be

barred from playing in the big game because :th_ey .. .
don't go to class, while the swimmers, tennisand.

field hockey players who didn’t go would be cited.
We were hoping the the Senate Athletic Com-

_ mittee would honestly try to explore methods of
striking a balance between the demands of school
and athletics to which student athletes are sub-

ject. With the passing of this recent prdposal-, we

find ourselves still waiting.

‘Pledges’ Non-Existent At

l3dit()r’s note: The following Isa

copy of a letter that was sent to Bob

Bonesso, president of the lnterfra-
ternity Council.

Dear Bob:
We, the brothers and associates of
the University of Pittsburgh Chap-

ter of Lambda Chi Alpha, would’

like to protest to the lnterfraternity
Council that although our chapter
has been on the Pitt campus for
morethan three yearsfin general.
the lnterfraternity Council and the
University of Pittsburgh administra-

.tion have refused to recognize the

fact that Lambda Chi Alpha has no
pledges;'we have associate members.
This is a question not merelyiof ter-
minology, but of the status of new
members. Associate members has
every right, responsibility, and privi-
lege of a full brother.

The proof ofthe assertion that we
have not been recognized as having
associate members instead of

pledges is seen in the fact that each

term the lnterfraternity Council
sponsors its “Pledge Banquet.“ No
mention is ever made of associate
membe‘rs. When the freshman regis-
ter is published each year, the term
“pledge" is always defined in the
Greek section. but the term “asso-
ciate” is always absent. In addition.
the term “pledge trainer" or“p,ledge
master" is always included. What,
pray tell. does a pledge trainer do?
Teach pledges to jump through
flaming hoops and sit up on their
haunches, begging for signatures in
their pledge books? A

In our chapter, both the brothers

and associates pay dues oft$2 per.

member to the lnterfraternity Coun-
cil each term. However. the lnterfra-
ternity ‘Council does not properly
represent all ofits members, refusing
to acknowledge, the existence of our.
associate members. it seems that, in
the eyes of the lnterfraternity Coun-
cil. they.are either pledges or nothing
at all._ T
The lnterfraternity Council and
the University of Pittsburgh may be
content to maintainthe status quo.

but Lambda Chi Alpha is not. For-

the past two years our chapter’s Fush
has exceeded the averagecampus
rush for fraternities. Lambda Chi
Alpha was the first fraternity to
establish an alcohol-awareness pro-
gram and a drug-awareness pro-
gram. and one of the first national
fraternities to have an undergradu-
ate member on its national board of
directors. Lambda Chi Alpha was
also the first and only fraternity to
abolish the pledgcprogram and all
of thefha/ing and abuse of pledges
that accompanies’ it. replacing it
instead with an associate member-

C

program. This means that we have

done away with pledges, pledge hats, ‘‘

pledge pins, pledge books, pledge
paddles, and that old favorite, Hell
Week. fnstead, we try to teach’
brotherhood from the very start
through our Fraternity Education
Program. Somehow, the concept of
treating another human being like a
mindless subservient creature with
no feelings whatsoever for three
months. and then welcoming him

We Think /rs

Tuition hikes. curriculum reform, ’

student government elections. Every
college campus has its share of con-
troversial issues, and Pitt is no
exception. Sometimes. however,
when we think our battles are the
toughest, and our problems the big-
gest‘, it’s a welcomelrelief to take a
look at -what students on other col-
lege campuses have to put up with.

University of Pennsylvania so you
thought building fraternity housing
was a big deal? Not at Penn. Penn’s
Kappa Sigma fraternity is -facing a
possible suspension becauseof
“racial slurs” uttered by one of its
members. The fraternity member
was reported to have shouted ‘at sev-

eral black children crossing the fra- ,

ternity’s backyard.

This particular Penn /freﬁernity
has had more than its share oftrou-
bles. Since being placed on proba-
tltiln last year, the fraternity has been
in olved in the theft of furniture

W from a university building, the use of

BB guns. and a case involving indi-
vidual members who allegedly made
anti-semitic comments. Nice to
know that Penn fraternities are so
open-minded.

Kent State. the site of one of

America‘s tragedies during the Viet-
nam war. Kent state seems to have
cooled‘ considerably. The biggest
dilemma occupying the university
officials now is that downtown Kent

Frat V

with open arms and fraternal feel-
ings after initiation, is hypocritical.
We are truly sorry if our humanitar-
ianism. idealism.‘and worst of all,
morality areoffensive to the Inter-
fraternity Council. but Lambda Chi‘
Alpha is not goingto be held back by
anyone who insists on living in the
dark ages. .

Pitt Title HopesStrengthen with FSU Rout 

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
The improbable drearniliv‘es on.
The third-ranked Pitt Panther
football team-‘once underrated. its
ability understated and its record

unblemished—took another la rge

step toward college football's sum-
mit Saturday, flogging the llth-
~ranked Florida State Seminoles
42-14 at Pitt Stadium. \
If any questions about the
Panther team remained going into
the showdown with the Seminoles
;(4-2). Pitt turned them into exclama-
tion points with a synchcronized.

all-around effort that left Florida‘
State looking a lot like the. Cincin-

nati and Illinois of games past.

It was a rout. Against a team that up

had defeated Notre Dame-and Ohio
State in preceding weeks, the game
also provided-finally---a meaning-
ful yardstick to measure Pitt’s worth
by. And Pitt Coach Jackie Sherril
was duly impressed.

“l’m not so sure we don’t deserve
to be No. l,” Sherril said after the
game in Pitt’s euphoric lockerroom.

‘receivers

“l, don’t know if anyone is better
than us."
Strong words for a man who

‘covets understanding and revels in

the rhetorical utterances coaches
love to shovel to the media—i.e., we
were fortunate to win. I thank God
for inventing football to give methis

. opportunity, etc., etc.

Saturday. Sherrill and his players
would have none of it. Pitt lo_oked
that good. ’

“We should be No. I,” said an
ebullient Julius Dawkins after the
game. “This team is a little better
than last year’s. We’re a lot closer to
each other.” .

Blasphemy‘? Believe it or not. the
statistics at leastbear Dawkins out.

‘Pitt’s defense is ranked first nation-*

ally in total defense. quarterback
Dan Ma_rino continuesto hold down‘
the top rank in passing efficiency
and Dawkins leads the nation’s
with nine touchdown
receptions. As a team, Pitt ranks in
the top 10 nationally in six other
categories—-including its sixth place

in total offense with an average of
256.3 yards a game. Against FSU.
with the return of Marino after a
one-week layoff.’ the offense was fir-
ing on all cylinders.

Junior Panther tailback Bryan
Thomas slashed and shredded the
Seminoles for one touchdown and
2l7 yards rushing on 33~‘carries. it
was the highest individual Pitt rush-
ing day since Tony Dorsett toted the
ball in Pitt’s I976 National Cham-
pionship season. It was also the
ninth best rushing performance ever
by a Pitt back in one game.

Thomas placed a large measureof
the credit with Pi/tt‘s offensiye line,
which continues to bury its assign-
ments with the chilling frequency of
a pack of gravediggers. When
they’re not protecting Marino from
all comers. they’re opening holes
large enough fo'r cement trucks to
lumber through--not to mention
running backs.

And once the hole is there, Tho‘-
mas has his own method of taking
advantage of it;

Pitt linebacker Sal Sunseri led Pitt's defense in the tirst half.

22-yard interception return fora touchdown.

Here Sunseri celebrates his

Roth photo «

“I run recklessly, go for daylight
and try to run through tackles."
Thomas said. “Arm tackles
shouldn't bring you down. One-on-
one in the open field. you should
always beat the man."

Greatly aided by Thoma’s’rushing
outburst and Marino‘s l5 of 27 day
of 251 yards passing. the Panthers
rolled for 503 total yards Saturday.
their highest total this year.

Marino. wearing specially-
designed shoulder pads to protect‘
his sore right shoulder, showed little
ill effectsggf his injury or two—week
layoff.

“l was hesitant with the shoulder
at first and l shouldn’t have been."
Marino said. “But after I started
humming the ball. it felt good".

The junior quarterback. who has
suddenly thrown his way into con-
tention for the Heisman Trophy.
passed for three touchdowns in the
game that was highlighted by the

. Panthers‘ big plays. both offensively

and defensively.

Of Pitt‘s 42 points on the day. the
following came in explosive fashion:

0 Wayne DiBartola hauled in a
Marino pass at the FSU seven.

Unexpected Plays

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

They are members of the best de-
fensive team in the country. One is a
reckless linebacker. who has person-
ified the heart ofthc team. The other

"is a lithe safety who has shown a -

propensity for stealing enemy foot-
balls. F

OniSaturday they were the strang-
est of touchdown scorers ...... ..

The Panthers are clinging toa pre-
cious 7-() lead’ and the Florida
State Seminoles have the ball deep

in their own territory. Seminole

quarterback Ricky Stockstill fades

V back to pass and uncorks a pass to

one ofihis running backs. The pass
never makes it. Sal Sunseri, Pitt’s.
self—proclaimed wild man begins
rumbling towards the end '/one after
gathering in the ball.

Upon reaching the l()-yard line,

ture celebration. Ball aloft. the not-
so-swift Sunseri barely dove into the
end '/one beyond the graspbf a div-
ing Stockstill. Defensixe Coordina-
tor Fogc Fa/.io described his line-
backer’s not-so-beautiful touch-
down run. 2

“Sal was just trying to eatup the

clock with his 5.4 speed” he said.

Sunseri‘s comical run put Pitt
ahead l4—() but there was nothing
funny about the senior linebackcﬂs
play in the rest of the game. In the
first half alone. Sunseri made one‘
Seminole running back cough up the
ball with a tackle. and tippped the
ball away from a Florida State wide
receiver with a diving‘ plunge.

For all of his exploits on the field.
Sunseri’s contribution sterns far
deeper than the gridiron.

“Sal played an important part.

LadySpikersWin Tournament

By JODY GIDLEY

The football team was not the
only Panther team that made Pitt
proud this weekend; the women‘s

, volleyball team madetheircontribu—

iition

:

with a first-place finish in the
University of Illinois Invitational
tournament. ‘

The l()—team tournament featured
some of the’top-ranked volleyball
squads in the country and according
to Pitt Coach Shelton Collier. an
Eastern team was not expected to
win.

“This victoryfput Pitt on the map
in terms of a national volleyball
scene at this point,” said Collier.
“This was also one ofthe two strong-
est tournaments we will participate

* in this year. so it was an extremely

if ‘v . ' V» - u
.l&v,ﬂllp()lltinI win for us.

Pitt began their climb to the top
by defeating Lewis lTni\ersity l5~7
and l5-b. The lady Panthers con-

tinued to roll. knocking off South-
ern Illinois University I5-ll and
l5-5. lllinois State l5-l and l5-6 and
Louisiana State l5-9. l4-lo and lo-
l4.

The l.SU match wasa highlight of -

the tournament and the season up to
this pointfsaid qCollier.~ “Going into
the third game. the match was tied at
one game apiece. LSU was on the
brink of victory. however. we turned
things around and scored Hlstraight
points to win the game and the
match." he said. ‘

After defeating l.SU. Pitt moved
to the semifinials where they
shocked first-seeded Texas A&M
l5-I3. 9-I5. and l5—9. 1.‘

The llniyersity of lllinois was
Pitt's final yietim. and the lady
Panthers soundly defeated their
hosts 5-l5. l5—l2 and I5-I3 to win
the tournament.

According to Collier. dominant
serying was the P/\i~tt team's key to
success this weeltend.

We’ve been working hard on our

serving for the past couple of weeks.
Instead ofjust putting the ball in
play.we been trying to serve aces and
cause confusion in the other team."
he said. “in this tournament we were
very effective and our serving. by
far. wasthe mostdominant through-
out the tournament."

For Pitt. the most interesting—
aspect of the tournament was the
fact the Lady Panthers only had six
available players because ofinjuries.
The same six were required to play
every minute of every game.

“This is interesting because we
were able to completely dominate

our opponents with only siii play-.

“Seniors Paula Olsen and l.ind_a

According to Bemis. should Pitt
stay undefeated in league play by the
season’s end and Slippery Rock. still
ahead on points. a coaches’ confer-

league championship. Because
Slippery Rock plays ll conference

Old ScoringTouch 

By LISA GRENEVTCKI

The Pitt soccer teams scoring
attack. relatively silent for three

- games, is undergoing reasons why is

because their scoring attack is com-
ing alive. Troy Norton is a rejuvena-
tion of late. with help from an old
‘hand at scoring——Troy Norton.

Norton. a junior from Coatsville.
Pa.. is once again one ofthe leading
scorers on the Panther team. Last
year he was one ofthe top five scor-
ers and this year he is credited with
two goals and three assists.

Norton has had a long history of
scoring. As team captain and “MVP
in high school. he led his team in
scoring with20 goals his senior year.
and was the third—leading scorer in
the tough Chesmount League in
eastern Pennsylvania. traditionally
one of the top leagues in the state.

At Coatsville ‘High. Norton
played in the midfield as a halfback.
but when he came to Pitt, Coach Leo
Bemis switched him to the forward
line.

Norton found a home at the wing
position. ’ ‘

“Coach Bemis switched me to for-
ward because he liked my offensive
skills better than my defensive‘
skills.”'said Norton. “He put me on
the left side because T can shoot with
both feet and I can cross the ball

knack for scoring.

.v

with my left foot."

Norton enjoys thewtyiiig spot not“

only for the thrill of scgoring. but also
the challenge of the position.
“The challenge is in beating an

opposing fullback. who is usually’
bigger and stronger than I am,” said ~
the 5—foot~9-inch, T50-pound Nor— V

ton. “The mainjob of the wing is to

i take the ball down the field and try
to spread out the defense. Once you .

make the holes. you can drop the

ball back to the halfback or striker

to score or take it in yourself.”
Norto.n’s 4.6 speed in the 40-yard

dash (which makes him one of the if

fastest players on the team), and
good ball handling skills make hima

strong scoring threat. when he‘s on 

the field.

According to Norton; he has had 
good coaching from the startvof his if 

  

 

career. His eoa-ch at Coatsvile, Rich T

Saylor. was a big help to Norton‘“and.. 
now as a Panther booter, Norton is 
aided by Bemis and his assistant 

coach Joe Luxbacher. P
“Luxbacher is a really big help.’

said Norton. “He was a pro player
and he knows a lot of new tech- ..

niques. He doesn’tjust yell when you
do something wrong; He’ll take you

aside and show you theiwcorrect way’”“‘*”

to do it." ” »

Number One Jinx Continues ;Texas Gets Thrashed

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Texas committed seven turnovers
on Saturday while the Pitt Panthers
lost the ball five times. The similarity
ends there. The top-ranked Texas
Longhorns were crunched 42-I I by
a ﬁred-up Arkansas team while the
third-ranked Panthers did the
crunching, walloping Florida State
42-I4.

Thejinx on No. I teams continued
as Texas, the fourth team to occupy
the spot this season went down to
defeat. Razorback quarterback
Tom Jones, younger brother of Ba]-
timore Colts’ quarterback Bert
Jones, ran for two touchdowns and
passed for another in Arkansas'near
ﬂawless win. Texas scored its only
touchdown late in the game when
the result had already been decided.

The Penn State Nittany Lions
should take over the vacated No. I
spot after their 4|-I6 pasting of Syr-
acuse. Curt Warner ran for 256
yards, a Penn State record, and
Todd Blackledge completed 10 of I l
passes in the Lions‘ easy win. After
being snubbed last week in the polls,
Joe Paterno‘s team should be next
up to the challenge of the No. I jinx.

11 [E1]

The Pitt Panthers made a strong
bid for the No. 2 spot with a surpris-
ingly easy 42-l4 win over l0th
ranked Florida State. Bryan Tho-
mas’ 2l7 yards highlighteda big-
play day for Pitt. The Panthers
scored on an 83-yard puntgreturn by
safety Tom Flynn, a 22-yard inter-
ception return by Sal Sunseri and a
65-yard bomb from Dan Marino to
Julius Dawkins. After sitting out
last week’s I7-0 win over West Virgi-

Shaky Calls
Cost Win
ForLady

Panthers

By MARIE HUFF

Pitt’s Lady Panther field hockey
season came to a disappointing close
Friday afternoon when Kutztown
edged the Pitt team 3-2. in a game
that could have easily gone the other
way. , 7

Two questionable calls’ in‘ the
second half may have cost Pitt the
win. With the score tied at 2-2, Pitt‘s
Dee Dee Kantner slapped the ball
into the goal about l0‘minutes into
play. However, an official disquali-
fied the goal. saying that the ball hit
a players foot before it went in.
According to field hodkey rules, the
ball must go in the goal untouched in
order to count.

With a little less than I3 minutes N

remaining, Kut7.town’s Carol Lorup V

finally scored after being denied  W.

scores several times by the Pitt
defense‘s outstanding play. The
Lady Panthers protested that the
shot went in off of someone’s foot,
but to no avail. lnstead of 3-2 Pitt, it
was 3-2 Kutztown and that’s how it

‘stood at the end of the game.

“I definitely feel that Kutztown
should not have beenpgiven that
third g‘oal."‘said Pitt‘;.Cyoach Cindy
DiGiacomo. “Dee Dee's goal should
have been good, too. The same offi-

cial made both calls. l don't know

how she could let one count andnot
the other."  L i .

Kutztown opened the scoring 10
minutes into the first half on a shot
by Denise l.ong.'Pitt’s Sue Shahcen
knotted the score about five minutes
later, shooting the ball between the
legs of the Kutztown goalie. Lorup
put Kutztown back on top, 2-] , half-
way through the first half.

The lead see—sawed again when
Pitt’s Kantner flicked the ball over
the Kutztown goalie’s shoulder and
into the corner of the cage to tie the
score again at 2-2, with about ten
minutes left in the half.

Pitt was threatening Kut7.town’s
lead at the end of the game, making
several unsuccessful shots on the
goal. Kutztown. who had been

managed successfully to stall for

“Everyone hates to lose these
kind of games,“ said DiGiacomo. “I
really feel we were the better team
out there.”

With a 4-6-2 season record, the
Lady Panthers must now look to
next season. The young squad will

Collier‘ was also impressed with
substitutes Shelly Riemersma and
Judy Young. who replaced injured
starters Maria Perez and Robin
Kuka_lis.

“They both played‘ excellent

 defense and were a big part of the
‘?tTo)ffense throughoutthe tourament.“

he said. “If we can get that kind of
performance from our substitutes
combined with Olsen. Stadler. and
Zack. we can be a very good team.

“We were also anticipating a big

' tournament from setter,.lulie Gaul.

Julie has only been setting for a year
but proved to be one of the top set-
ters at this tournament"I"‘
"According to Collier. the team
really rose to the occasion this week~

Trailing 21-0 midway through the
second quarter, Bowden yanked
Stockstill in favor of seldom-used
junior quarterback Blair Williams in
the hope of “getting something
going."

“We weren‘t moving the ball and
we weren’t scoring.” said Bowden.
“Williams has a better arm. We went
for a change of pace."

With Williams. the Seminoles
pace went from a very slow to just
slow. Though the Seminoles scored
twice under Williams’ guidance, the
first drive was aided by a pass inter-
ference call on Pitt in the end zone.
From the I-yard line. Whiting rolled
in for the score.

Florida State’s other score came
in the third quarter on a 5~yard TD
toss from Williams to tight end Sam
Childers. cappingan 89-yard drive.

Though the Pitt defense bended
for 31 1 total yards. the Panthers big
plays. like the first-quarter goal line
stand and cornerback Tim Lewis’
fourth-quarter interception on the
3-yard line, snuffed out several FSU
scoring threats. I

“Our front five put on a lot of
pressure.” Sherrill said. “If we force
them to throw, we figured we were in
good shape." ‘

They figured right. And finally,
the Panthers’ had avenged the loss to
the Seminoles last year, the loss that

‘made Pitt the runners—up for the

national championship instead ofits
owners. For the entire Pitt squad,
the payback was sweet.

“I wasn‘t here last year. but you 

could see the hurt on Sal (Sunseri)
and Emil Boures’ faces.” said Pitt
freshman drop end Chris Doleman.
“Sal and Boures got us all up for the
game.”

And another step toward the
national title. The
dream lives on.’

Camogie is a fast—paced, rugged ‘

lrish sport for women that combines
elements of field hockey and
lacrosse. Although there are cur-
rently just six major teams in the
entire United States, the sport is
gaining *a growing audience of
“ intrigued spectators.

But to- Mary Curran,'- a first-
generation lrishwoman and student
at the University of Pittsburgh at
Johnstown, camogie is not only a
sport, but an important part of her
attempt to cling to her lrish heritage.

“Camogie is more than a women’s
sport to me. It is a representation of
who l amvtoday and of where I came
from,” Curran explained.

Like those of the other l0 players

of on the Pittsburgh team, Curran’s
parents came from lreland to Amer-
ica seeking a better way oflife. Since
arriving here, «the families have
fought to keep aifirm grasp on their
lrish roots through interaction at
W places like the Irish Centre of Pitts-
burgh... '

years, she saysa bond was forged
among the Centre‘s children
members. Its a bond that’s founded
on their common ancestry and nur-
tured by their native lrish parents.

Five years ago, the girls at the
lrish Centre started a camogie team
to further “enrich our lrish herit-
age." Curran said.

The ll-woman team, the exact
number it takes to field a camogie
squad, was comprised of players
who shared a bond beyond the ties
regular teammates 'share—~ these
girls grew up with each other.

“We all feel close to one another
because we shared the good times
and the hard times in our lives,"Cur-
ran said.

That has prepared the girls well
for the game of camogie, a tough,

_ rough contact sport thatfeaturesthe _

body-checking and lightening quick
shot—making of lacrosse, combined
with the stick-handling features of
field hockey.

The structure ofthe s_port, in fact,
is very similar to that of field
hockey-—but it’s rougher. Each cam-
ogie team has a goalie, three back-
ends, three centers, three forVv‘ards
and a center-forward who plays up
front. The forwards are the offensive
attackers and the backends are the‘
defenders.

The games are played on a foot-
ball field, where the players test their ?
stamina over the one-hour course of
the game. Because the Pittsburgh
team has exactly ll members, they
ion’t have the luxury of substitu-

ions. If a player is injured, _Pitts- .
aurgh is forced to play shorthanded.

The players use hurling sticks,
similar ,to hockey sticks, made of
g flexible wood and imported from i
.i lreland. , ’ _.k J__

. To start the game, the “slither”. a
ball resembling a raquetball in both
size and material, is tossed onto the
field by a referee. “From that point.
it is a tackle free—for—all." Curran
explained. “You may swing the
hurling stick along the ground to
recover'the ball or else swing the
stick into the air to stop the ball."

Players are not permitted to touch
the slither with their hands——~- they
have to rely on good stickwork to
keep possession ofthe ball and good
-passing to work the slither down— ,
field. The object of the game is to get
the ball across the goal line—thcre
are no nets.just a goal area. lt‘s the '
same as an end zone on a football
field.

“The name 0“ the game is team
work," Curran said.

The girls wear green kilts, but
don't let the skirts fool you. Its a
rough sr_)ort—when fully attired, the
players look- like they're going into
battle. For protection, the girls wear
white boots, helmets, sometimes
with face ‘masks, and shin pads.

Before a game,'Curran says the
team is always “fired up and readyto

.~. a,

_ _ _>s 4
go.” This doesn't mean everyone is  ”

fortunate to finish the game.

Because of the violent nature of the
game, injuries occur. Last month a
Pittsburgh player was struckin the
face by a stick and last several teeth.
But the danger does not keep the
girls from playing. Until last season,
in fact, the Pittsburgh team had one
45-year-old_, woman on the team,
Most of the current players. how-34%
ever, are college age women.  

“When we started the team,;t~no._~~-.-‘
one knew what camogie was,"_Cu i
ran said.’ ‘,4 _~ ": .,

To learn abioiiit étifiieuigame, team‘ '=
members studied booklets and pam-
phlets about the ga'“n1’§"§‘itd got poin-
ters on "the A sport whenever they
made their frequent trips back to
Ireland. g ' '

“We visit lreland once a year with
our families. By watching the teams
in Ireland, we are picking up the
style and technique of the sport. We
rarely meet anyone (here) who
knows any tips that can help us.”

In the five-year existence" of the
team, the girls have not had a formal
coach. The team is also 'entirely
funded by its members and their
families. Each girl pays for her own
equipment, uniform and travel
expenses. Curran said it's well worth
the cost. .

- “Playing against the other teams
across the nation, we get the oppor-
tunity to meet other lrish-American
people whose parents are (also)'from
lreland,” Currarrsaid. “When I meet
someone at a camogie game, each of
us realizes the special things we have
in common. A part of me is found in
each lrish player."

. “Everyone on the team has grown
up together. We allhave relied on
each other to succeed.” Curran said.
“Camogie is a game made up of a
team of‘ families,” .

By playing other teams in the
country, Curran said, that “family"
extends to other Irish people the
team comes in Contact with. It's not
uncommon for these lrish families
to “adopt“ other lrish people who
share the same family traditions and
customs, Curran said.

“In our family, if we are close to
someone. then he is considered a
part of the Curran family,” Curran
said. And camogie’ is one of the
things that helps bring these “fami-
lies" together.

“We are into camogie because it is
in our blood. We are fighting to mas-
ter something in our background,"
Curran said. “When l am out on the
field playing the game with‘ “my
girls”, it's a sensational feeling. We
are family."

That’s what makes camogie much
more than just a game.
