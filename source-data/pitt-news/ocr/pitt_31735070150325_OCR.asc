Volunteer Fair offers
options for altruism

Gideon Bradshaw
Staff Wrz'ter

Even with coursework starting to
overwhelm students post-syllabus
week, many are still ﬁnding time to
volunteer.

On Tuesday, students gathered
outside of the William Pitt Union for
the 18th armual Volunteer Fair, where
more than 70 volunteer organiza-
tions — such as Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape, Operation Better Block
and Pitt Student Government Board’s
Community Outreach Committee —
gathered to recruit students for their
various altruistic causes.

Cathleen Connor, a coordinator
with Pitt’s Student Volunteer Out-
reach, organized the event on behalf
of the oﬂice. She was pleased with the
fair’s tumout this year, saying that
the location outside the Union on
the Bigelow Boulevard side ensured
that the event attracted more passing
students than last year’s event, which
was held inside. A -

Connor said that the annual fair
can build lasting ties between stu-

. dents and service organizations. She

emphasized that at the long rows
of tables stretched over the Union
Lawn, students could learn about a
wide range of volunteering oppor-
tunities.

According to Connor, some stu-
dents have found an organization
at the fair and spent the rest of the
year volunteering for it. She added
that students can help ﬁll a need for
volunteers. A

“The agencies really need the
help,” she said. “Whatever the stu-
dent can volunteer, whether it’s once
a week or once a term, they’re happy
for whatever [volunteers] they get.”

Nicole Sperduto, 34, said that
with the pleasant weather, she was
happy to get out of her oﬂice for a

few hours to talk to students. Sper-
duto is the outreach coordinator for
Ronald McDonald House Charities,
a non-proﬁt organization connected
to the Children’s Hospital.

The charity serves families who
travel to Pittsburgh when a child is
under care at one of the city’s hos-
pitals. Even with its 60 suites, the
center is often full. Most families stay
for several months, but families have
stayed there as long as two years in
the past. The center asks for a dona-
tion of $15 per night, but does not
turn away families who carmot pay.

“We try to provide a home for
these families and make things easier
for them while they are here with
their kids,” she said.

Primarily, Sperduto was looking
for students who would be willingto
cook meals at the center. However,
the Ronald McDonald House also
seeks volunteers who will play games
with or facilitate other activities for
the families, particularly children.

Through the meals and activities,
volunteers help to ease the anxiety of
the families, whose children are of-
ten suffering from serious illnesses.

Sperduto said that she has en-
joyed working with the ﬁve or six
groups of Pitt students who already
volunteer at the center — each ab out
once a month — and she was pleased
tosee interest from more students.

Mary Mallampalli, the chairwom-
an of SGB’s Community Outreach
Committee, was delighted to see the
tables lined with students looking to
volunteer in the community.

A “It’s greatto see so many students ~

are out here willing to get involved in
the community,” Mallampalli said.
“Giving back tovthe community is
something we Pitt students take

pride in.” -

Each day, students ﬁnishing their
workouts at the Petersen ’ Events
Center struggle to reﬁll their water
bottles at old—fashioned fountains —
but not for long. ‘
Hydration stations — which al-
low students to reﬁll reusable water
bottles by placing them in front of a

. sensor that triggers a stream ofwater

to fall directly into the bottle — are
installed in the William Pitt Union,
O’Hara Student Center, Posvar Hall,

man Library. , ’

“Pitt makes the decision on
whether hydration stations are in-
stalled at the Petersen Events Center,
and we will be installing hydration
stations in a few locations, includ-
ing near the ﬁtness center, before the
basketball season starts,” University
spokesmanjohn Fedele said.

While the administration has the
ﬁnal say as to where the stations are
installed, the Green Fund, a group
under the Student Government
Board’s Environmental Committee
that helps coordinate sustainability
projects on campus, approached the
administration and providedfunding
forthe original station installed in the

William Pitt Union in 2011.

SGB member Gordon Louderback
said that it was ideal for the Environ-
mental Committee to team up with
the University on the project, as the
price of multiple units —— which each
cost approximately $1,500, plus in-
stallation fees -— wouldfall outside of
the group’s spending power.

“We started itasanSGB initiative,
but the University took it over as an
incentive, which is great,” Louder-
back said. “[Pittwas] able to put them

Student Government Board talks library hours, healthy living

Megan Trimble
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

The Student Government Board
meeting opened with reverent
tones as the general meeting of-
fered ﬁve seconds of silence in rec-
ognition and remembrance of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

But the somber tone didn’t last
long, and the Board‘ quickly moved
on to lighter business at Tuesday
night’s public meeting in Nordy’s
Place. During the hour-and-15-min-
ute meeting, the Board — respon-
sible for distributing funds from
the more than $2 million Student
Activities Fund — presented ideas
and events regarding student com-
munity service involvement, voter
registration and academic issues.

Keeping with the previous meet-
ing’s trend of supporting voter reg-
istration, Board member Julie Hal-
linan asked for a show of hands of
those who are already registered to
vote and said that info on the new ID
law would be available to students.
Challengers of the new voter ID law
will maketheir case this Thursday
before the Commonwealth Court.

Board member Gordon Loud-
erback added his support for voter
registration, but then switched his
focus to mention Pitt Band Direc-
tor Jack Anderson, who recently
announced his retirement. Louder-

Shewas walking around the event
passing out ﬂyers for Pitt Make A
Difference Day, an event in which
more than 4,000 students clean up
Oakland and the surrounding com-
munities. This year, the event takes
place on Oct. 20.

“I hope students would be willing
to take this one day to give back,”
she said.

Of course, Mal1ampalliwasn’t
the only one taking to the Union
Lawn for volunteering recruitment
purposes.

Chay Tyler, a program coordi-
nator for the City of Pittsburgh De-
partment of Parks and Recreation,
sat at a table and asked students to
volunteer for the Great Race that

takes place throughout the suburbs
of Pittsburgh.

He said he was looking for stu-
dents who are “energetic,” willing to
help and “willing to be up early in the
morning.” The race, which includes
a 5K and 10K run/walk, takes place

on Sept. 30.

One student already involved
in a campus service organization

back urged students to thank him
for his dedication to the Pitt tradi-
tion.

“I would like to take the opportu-
nity to thank him, as he’s been with
the Pitt family for 50 years, and his
family has been involved with the
Pitt band for 70 years,” Louderback
said. “I am not in the band myself,
but not all bleed blue and gold like
he does, so take the moment to give
him a handshake and thank him for
everything.”

Board member Megan McGrath
asked students to take part in com-
munity service efforts around cam-
pus by registering for Pitt Make A
Difference Day. PMADD registra-
tion will close Oct. 1, or once 4,000
people have registered for the day
of community service scheduled to
take place on Saturday, Oct. 20. Reg-
istration will not reopen once full,
and Board member Alex Murdoch
su'essed ‘the importance of early
registration.

“There are less than 2,000 spots
left, so get groups’ [registrations] in
sooner, rather than later,” he said.

Students can also look forward
to academic changes and policies
around campus in the coming year,
that is, if the Board has its way.

Board member Natalie Rothen-
berger said she will be meeting with
members of Academic Affairs to
educate students about the book

found that the fair was a useﬁil way
to branch out into the community.
Lauren Mallon, a sophomore English
writing and communications major,
said she was already involved with
Epsilon Sigma Alpha as the group’s
service chairwoman.

Mallon expected that the co-ed
service fraternity could link up with
some of the other organizations that
sent representatives. She was par-
ticularly interested in a group that
aimed to raise awareness about HIV
and AIDS through education.

“There are tons of organizations
here that I would just love to get in-
volved in,” Mallon said.

Harshini Sahani, a freshman
molecular biology and pre-med
major, said she learned a lot at the
fair. Originally from Newjersey, she
was unfamiliar with the non-proﬁt
organizations in Pittsburgh. Hav-
ing volunteered at a tutoring center
during her senioryear in high school,
she knew she wanted to help under-
privileged youth. The fair held plenty
of such opportunities. 1

“Something like this is really how
I am going to get into volunteering in
the area,” Sahani said. -A

buyback process and other options
surrounding the renting of text-
books at The Book Center.

“We will be meeting to create a
video for students to explain how
students could rent a book toward
the end of the semester for 20
bucks, for example,” she said.

Academic Affairs Committee
Chairman C.J. Stavrakos announced
progress made on his syllabus proj-
ect — a project that would make
sample syllabi available along with
course descriptions posted in the
online course catalog. Stavrakos
said he is conﬁdent that the project
can function successfully and that
academic departments will be con-
tacted to help make the syllabi addi-
tions aUniversity-wide change.

“I have also been in contact with
[Vice Provost and Dean of Students
Kathy] Humphrey to create extend-
ed library hours, and the committee
will continue to audit classes to be
considered for Arts and Sciences
gen-ed requirements,” Stavrakos
said to ﬁnish his report.

The idea of extended library
hours was ﬁrst implemented dur-
ing Stavrakos’s predecessor Pooja
Patel’s term as Academic Affairs
chair, and she worked with the-ad-
ministration to hold temporary,
test-stage extended library hours.

Expanding the number of cours-
es that fulﬁll gen-ed requirements

also began priorto this year’s Board,
with former Board member Alex
Zimmerman leading the charge.

The meeting closed with a state-
ment of “God save the Chancellor”
from Transportation and Safety
Committee Chair Richard White
and a health warning from the
Board.

“People around me seem to be
getting sick,” Board member Halim
Genus said. “Eat your vegetables,
take your vitamin C and wash your
hands.”

“And exercise!” Board member
Zoe Samudzi inteijected.

Allocations

HIMSA requested $3,001.85 to
attend a conference in Chicago. The
Allocations Committee initially rec-
ommended the Board deny the re-

ence focused too much on personal
development. After representatives
from the group presented their tes-

Facilities Management has ﬁinded the other
installations in conjunction with recent renova-
tion projects around campus.

Fedele saidthat in addition to the most re-
cently installed unit on the ground ﬂoor of the

for installation, and the University plans to place
even more stations around campus.

“Housing is working with students to de-
termine the demand for others,” Fedele said.

According to Rachel Meyer, SBG Environ-
mental Committee chairwoman, that demand
is growing. I ,

“I actually just walked through the Union
and I saw a line for the hydration station, which
was exciting, because I hadn’t really seen that
happen before,” Meyer said. “There didn’t used
to be lines, but I think because we are getting
more on campus that people are recognizing
them — becoming more aware of their pres-
ence, and therefore, using them more.”

_ Meyer said other students, such as engi-
neering students, may notice the absences of
stations in buildings such as Benedum Hall and
want them installed in those areas, as well. The

committee’s ultimate goal, Meyer said, would
be a hydration station in each building across
campus.

Fedele said that the installation time for each
station depends on the complexity of the proj-
ect. If a water fountain doesn’t initially exist at
the proposed location, then more time is needed
to make the proper arrangements.

Meyer said that the University can’t proﬁt
from the stations because they decrease water
bottle sales. She also said the project is in place
entirely for the students’ beneﬁt. She said stu-
dents should take advantage of the stations,
which provide multiple beneﬁts, including con-
venience and water at no cost.

Though Louderback and Meyer don’t know
the exact statistics pertaining to the effect the
stations have had on students’ reusable water
bottle usage, both agree that the project has
produced positive results.

“In terms of promoting reusable water bot-
tles, I think it’s been huge,” Louderback said.
“One of the coolest features that the stations
have are ongoing tallies that give you a rough es-
timate on saved waste from disposable bottles.”

The original hydration station in the Union
has helped to eliminate the waste from more
than 13,500 disposable plastic bottles, accord-
ingto the counter on the machine, and the later-
installed unit in Posvar Hall has eliminated the
waste from more than 1,800.

“Who knows, people maybe more inclined to
go and reﬁll their water bottle, instead ofhead—

ing over to avending machine and grabbing an
Aquaﬁna,” Louderback said. I

Pitt should release OMET results

Alex Zimmerman
For The Pitt News

According to Urban Dictionary,
the foremost source of words and
phrases otherwise unavailable to
people under 32, syllabus week
is “the ﬁrst week of class, when
syllabi are passed out  a basic
waste of time.” True enough. But
what will class look like once the
awkward introductions are over
and we can no longer just ritu-
alistically read syllabi? Students
should have an answer to this
question before add/drop ends.
Pitt has this information, but isn’t
willing to share it with students.
Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Measurement
and Evaluation of Teaching
(OMET) keeps track of student
evaluations of teacher perfor-
mance. Although professors are
required to, most sign up to give
students an opportunity to hon-

estly and anonymously share their .

opinions of their courses. These
evaluations typically ask students
to evaluate whether the instructor
“stimulated my thinking, evalu-
ated my work fairly [and] pre-
sented the course in an organized
manner.” At the end, students can
write freely in sentences instead of
selecting pre—written responses.

This is exactly the kind of in-
formation students should have at
their ﬁngertips when registering
for courses. Students who are in-
terested in squeezing every last bit
of value out of their undergraduate
educations should have the option
of being selective in the quality
of teaching they seek out. Many
students do this anyway, but the
ﬁrst two weeks of class are often
a busy and less-than-ideal context
to seriously evaluate professors
before it’s too late to drop and try
to catch up in another course.

Imagine knowing in advance
what a particular professor’s
strengths and weaknesses are
based on dozens or even thou-
sands of students before you. You
could select classes that have par-
ticularly stimulating discussions
or brilliant lectures. You could
take courses that are geared to-
ward your particular learning style
or disability.

From a student perspective,
this seems like a no—brainer, but
faculty might be less likely to think
releasing this information within
the Pitt community is a good idea.
A brief perusal of Ratemypro-
fessors.com is probably all the
evidence the faculty needs to be
wary of making their evaluations

available to students. Although
sites like Ratemyprofessors.com
have a tendency to attract only the
most glowing or outraged assess-
ments of professor performance, a
more representative sample would
likely crowd out such obvious re-
sponse biases.

If students know their respons-
es will be seen by peers, instead
of disappearing into the ofﬁces of
deans and department chairs, they
will be more likely to give mean-
ingful feedback. Better student
feedback wouldn’t just beneﬁt
students who want to ﬁnd good
classes; it would raise the qual-
ity of undergraduate education
across the board. 7

Teachers who routinely get
negative feedback would be more
likely to get help from Pitt’s Cen-
ter for Instructional Development
and Distance Education (CIDDE)
to improve their teaching. CIDDE
offers a variety of resources to
improve teaching —— including
workshops and consultations ——
that would undoubtedly be used
at a greater rate if student surveys
were available within the Univer-
sity community.

America has moved past time for gun control discussion

Eric Baldwin
For The Pitt News

How many massacres does it take for there
to be a serious discussion about guns in this
country‘?]ames Holmes shot twelve people
in a movie‘ theatre in Colorado. A white su-
premacist walked into a Sikh temple and
took down six people. A recently unemployed
person opened ﬁre in midtown Manhattan.
Now-deceasedjohn F. Shick walked into the
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic and
killed two people in March. Congresswoman
Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the face at a
supermarket. A physician opened ﬁre on
soldiers at Fort Hood. These are only some
of the major events of recent times, but the
U.S. has a long history of massacres. The
time for conversation and debate on guns
has passed, and the time for action is here.

In order t0 have 3. conversation al)Ol1lZ~

guns, the arguments of pro—gun Americans
need to be stripped, and the discussion needs
to revolve around facts. There are approxi-

mately 100,000 deaths or wounds inﬂicted -

by ﬁrearms each year in the U.S., and there
have been one million deaths caused by ﬁre-
arms since 1968 in the U.S. alone. One claim
made by pro—gun activists is that guns are
required for self- defense, even though quan-
titative data demonstrates that a ﬁrearm is

22 percent more likely to be used for suicide,
criminal assault or homicide.

Pro-gun activists will often claim that
gun violence is also on the rise in western
Europe, a place that liberals reference as
a gun-free haven. It may be true that gun
violence in western European countries is
more prevalent recently than it has been
historically, yet levels are substantially lower
on average, and we could learn from the Eu-
ropean model of gun control: no guns, no
exceptions. In Norway, where last summer
a neo-Nazi opened ﬁre on government of-
ﬁcials and adolescents, there are 1.99 gun
deaths per 100,000 citizens annually. This
was the largest act of public violence in the
last 30 years in Norway. In Spain, there are’s
2.28 deaths per 100,000 citizens annually. In

France (where gun regulation is looser) there ,

are 4.60 deaths per year. Finally, topping the
chart of industrialized western democra-
cies is the U.S. with 8.40 ﬁrearm deaths per
100,000 citizens per year.

The only rational solution that sensible

citizens should propose is the prohibition ,

of ﬁrearms among civilians. Why anyone in
21st—century America needs a handgun, a
military-style riﬂe or stockpiles of ammuni-
tion is incomprehensible. To quell the fears of
conﬁscation for those who already possess a
ﬁrearm, they could be grandfathered in and

could be permitted to keep their weapons un-
til death or misconduct. Eventually, over the
course of the next 50 years, weapons could
be phased out of civilian hands. The pro—gun
activists would immediately reject this type of
sound policy, and therefore both sides must
compromise in order to reach an amicable
solution that moves America forward.

A more mutual solution would make ﬁre-
arm purchases very difficult, and those indi-
viduals who already owned ﬁrearms would
be subject to substantial regulation and
scrutiny. People with certain psychological
disorders (as determined by a psychiatrist)
and ex—convicts and should all be prohibited
from owning guns. Also, parents living with
their children, as well as urban populations,
shouldn’t be permitted to have ﬁrearms, be-
cause the amount of damage an accidental
misﬁre could do is much higher because of
the presence of children or a denser popu-
lation.

Mi1itary— grade weaponry and bulk
amounts of ammunition serve no purpose in
the civilian realm, and no compromise should
include provisions to continue permitting the
sale of these mass killing devices. Holmes
had purchased 6,300 rounds and an M—16
semiautomatic riﬂe, and not a single red ﬂag
had been raised as to why a young graduate
student would need sufficient weaponry to

obliterate the population of a small town.

For those not in one of the prohibited
categories, they should be required to pass a
litany of tests before making ﬁrearm purchas-
es. Potential gun owners should be required
to undergo background checks and mental
health evaluations, as well as providing ref-
erences, a description ofwhat they plan on
using the gun for, how they plan on storing
it and an explanation of their desire to own a
gun. Gun owners should be subject to random
and periodic checks by law enforcement.
If we are going to permit the ownership of
lethal weapons, the state has an obligation
to provide an abundance of regulation and
safety checks to minimize the risk of erratic
behavior and to prevent another massacre.

The National Riﬂe Association often
claims that “guns don’t kill people, people kill
people.” The question must be asked, how do
people kill people? If we take away the lethal
instrument can we stop the killing? Or will
they ﬁnd other methods? If we can at least
take away one substantial method of killing,
it will be a step in the right direction. There
will be a reduction in homicides, suicides
and accidental wounds, all of which inﬂict
emotional pain on the collective conscious.
A step toward more gun regulation is a step
toward civility and a safer America.

Q FROM PAGE 5 I

ZIMMERMAN

There is, however, some troubling re-
search that suggests student evaluations are
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by faculty grading.
This can be especially detrimental to under-
graduate education because non-tenured
faculty have an incentive to obtain glowing
student assessments, even at the cost of
intellectual rigor. To combat this problem,
Pitt should explicitly require students to
give reasons for their assessments. Student
evaluators who don’t adequately support
their assessments would be ignored. The

committees responsible for granting tenure
and hiring new faculty are surely capable of
weeding out responses that don’t meaning-
fully evaluate teaching. Moreover, student
evaluations should only be one of several
ways teachers are evaluated. Senior faculty,
department chairs and CIDDE consultants
should also be responsible for giving teach-
ers feedback on instructional quality.

Pitt would hardly be a pioneer if it chose
to change its policy. Tulane, University of
Maryland, Carnegie Mellon, Duke, Rutgers,
Georgetown andjohns Hopkins all release
at least pieces of their student evaluations.
Most of these schools release them on their
university Internet portals, so they are
not available to the general public. Some

schools even offer incentives for students
to ﬁll out teacher evaluations. At Maryland,
students must ﬁll out evaluations in order
to access other student responses. Tulane
won’t let students see their grades until
their evaluations are complete.

Since Pitt’s teaching evaluations will in-
creasingly be administered online, students
will have even more time to thoughtfully
respond instead of rushing to ﬁll them out
at the end of a class period. We should take
this opportunity to promote a more open
attitude toward teacher performance by
letting students at least see the raw, quan-
titative data from their peers’ evaluations.
Even though Pitt is often slow to change,
University administrators and faculty might

be comforted to know that once universities
make student evaluations public, they al-
most never look back. According to several
faculty and administrators at CMU, once a
college decides to give students this infor-
mation, it just becomes part of the culture.

The explicit theme of Pitt’s self—study
submitted to the Middle States Commission
on Higher Education is, “usinga University-
wide culture of assessment for continuous
improvement.” If Provost Patricia Beeson is
serious about promoting an open, honest
and inclusive culture of assessment, she
should lead Pitt in j oining many of our peers

' in the effort to make teaching evaluations

available to students.

Panthers split pair of games against Liberty, VCU

72am misses opportunity to set single-season wins reborn’ over weekend

The‘ Pitt women’s soccer team didn’t fin-
ish its non-conference schedule the way
it wanted. - ‘ .

Following Friday’s 1-0 shutout vic-
tory over Liberty, the Panthers had an
opportunity to set a program‘ record for
non-conference wins.’ Instead, they were
shut out by Virginia Commonwealth in a
1-0 overtime defeat, drawing the ire of
head coach Greg Miller.

“As the game went on, we stopped
competing and stopped trying tofollow

our game plan,” Miller said ina press ~

release. “Give credit to VCU, we never had

' control of the game. They found momen-

tum and never let up. We didn’t have any
type of response. It was disappointing
thatwe had that type of effort.”

The team’s lack.of energy manifested
itself in the shot differential. VCU had 15
shots in the last 51 minutes of play and
21 overall. Pitt had a mere three during
that time. Only two of which were on

target. The Panthers managed just seven

‘shots all game.

Pitt’s five non-conference wins once
again tie the school record, which was
set in 2000, but reached again in 2001,
2006, 2007 and 2009. While Pitt was not
happy with its weekend performance,
it has set about getting things turned
around for Thursday’s Big East opener
at home against Marquette.

Steelers’ loss’
highlights
positives and
negatives

Donnie Tasser
Senior Stcyff Writer

National television wasn’t kind to Steel City
football this past weekend. Three days after
Pitt got drubbed by the Cincinnati Bearcats in

a mistake—ﬁlled Big East opener on ESPN, the , _

Steelers couldn’t avenge last season’s playoff
defeat, as they lost to the Denver Broncos on
NBC Sunday Night Football.

Peyton Manning diced through the Steel-
ers’ secondary, announcing to the rest of
the NFL — and speciﬁcally the Indianapolis
Colts ~— that his right arm, neck vertebrae
and endorsement skills — he calls audibles
in his Buick! — are still in peak condition.

Despite Denver’s dominance in the 31-19

» victory, we learned more about the Steelers

than we did about the Broncos that game. i
For Denver, the only question — and it was‘,
big — was how Manning would play after
ayear off. For the Steelers, however, many
smaller questions were answered in the loss.
And believe it or not, Steelers fans, being 0-1
is not the end of the world.

Week 1 Silver Linings

1. The defense will be better than it ap-
peared on Sunday.
A The Denver offense looked like a well-
oiled machine as Manning seamlessly carved
through the Steelers’ defense with the su«a

. per—efﬁcient no—huddle, I-am-the-offensive-

coordinator style that he ran so beautifully
in Indy.‘ _

Denver fans must have loved how Man-
ning dictated play after dealing with a year of
Tim Tebow’s I’ -a—fullback-masquerading}

Aas-a-quarterback-and—a-preacher-at—the-'

same—time act. The Steelers couldn’t gener-
ate much of apass rush, and Manning kept
the defense off—balance and continually ran
plays away from Troy Polamalu.

,But the presence of James Harrison and
Ryan Clark will obviously help solve this is-"*
sue. Harrison, easily the league’s most ter-
rifying player, will continue to wreak havoc
on left tackles, and C1ark’s presence in the
secondary will enable Polamalu to focus on
what he does best: drift all over the place con-
fusing quarterbacks and using his athleticism__
to disrupt running and passing plays alike. S

TASSER

2. Jonathan Dwyer looked good.

I’m not saying that the Steelers’ run game
looked good, because it didn’t.

But Dwyer averaged 4.8 yards on nine
carries, caught a couple of passes out of the
backﬁeld and showed good speed and nice
tackle-breaking ability. In short, he seems
to have a lot of potential.

Isaac Redman didn’t look bad but was
the beneﬁciary of poor line play, resulting
in an awful stat line.

When Rashard Mendenhall returns, he
will be pushed for time by both of these two.

3. Ben looked like Ben.

Out on the ﬁeld, Ben Roethlisberger
didn’t seem as though he was trying to de-
cipher the “Rosetta Stone,” what he coined
new offensive coordinator Todd Haley’s
playbook this offseason. He appeared to
have it down pat.

His rapport with Antonio Brown and
Mike Wallace has carried over from last sea-
son, and he remembered that Heath Miller
is an effective pass—catching tight end. He
threw crisply and improvised when play
started to break down — skills we have come
to expect from Big Ben.

But as in many games, he also made a big
mistake, giving his critics more material in
the process. It seems that in a two-minute
drill, Roethlisberger either makes a series of
spectacular plays or kills the drive before it
gets started. The pick-six at the end of the

game was most deﬁnitely the latter.

Despite this tendency, over the course
of the season, Roethlisberger will win the
Steelers a fair share of games.

Week 1 Cloudy Skies

1. The offensive line was truly offensive.
Boy, was that ugly. I came into the year

 

thinking the line would be improved from
last season — and, boy, was I wrong.

Granted, the Broncos have a talented
defense, but the Pittsburgh backs had no
holes to run through, and Roethlisberger
had no time to pass.

Simply put, it was a sieve.

Sometimes when Roethlisberger gets
creative, the line’s ineptness works to the
Steelers’ advantage, but there was no cohe-
siveness and an overabundance of false start
penalties. What good are three lightning—fast
receivers when the quarterback doesn’t have
the time to let them run deep?

Pittsburgh has some truly great weap-
ons on offense, but without a serviceable
line — and at this point the line can’t even
be considered serviceable — all that speed
and athleticism is for naught.

2. The play calling was iffy.

Haley is supposedly an offensive genius.
He certainly has a diverse track record —
from his shotgun spread attack in Arizona
to his high-powered running game in Kansas
City.

But all I saw Sunday was a lack of creativ-
ity in the offensive play calling. The sequence
of run, run, pass only works so much. I’m all
for establishing the run, but what good is it

to run twice in a row and then face a third- —

and-8 or third-and—7 situation? And where
were the play-actions?

Granted, a good play-action‘ is difficult
to run without an effective rushing attack.
But still, when you run on ﬁrst down ﬁve
series in a row, it could be time to change
something up.

I’m willing to give Haley’s system time,
but Roethlisberger isn’t Tom Brady —
throwing three— and four~yard passes and
trying to force the run isn’t going to win
games.

Hopefully the Black and Gold can sort
these issues out before taking on the Jets
next week. I

Pirates treating fans to rollercoaster of emotion

Pat McAteer
Senior Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

For ﬁve months this year, I found
myself stuck in an up—and—down
relationship with a predictable
ending.

But this relationship wasn’t
with a girl, it was with a profes-
sional baseball team known as the
Pittsburgh Pirates.

Like most relationships, mine
began in an awkward, yet intrigu-
ing, fashion.

In April, the Pirates showed
remnants of last season’s early suc-
cess, ﬁnishing with 10 wins and
12 losses. Although their record
didn’t indicate signiﬁcant success,
one game in particular stuck in my
mind.

In their second game of the
season, the Pirates faced the for-
midable Philadelphia Phillies at
PNC Park. After a tough loss the
previous day to Phillies pitcher Roy
Halladay, one of the game’s best
pitchers, the Pirates responded
with a 2-1 victory over the Phillies
in 10 innings.

With catcher Michael McKenry

on third base, right ﬁelder Alex
Presley scored the game-winning
run with an inﬁeld single. I attend-
ed the game and took great joy in
Pittsburgh’s win over the Phillies
— ateam well-represented by fan
support in the Pitt student body.

It was then that my love affair
began.

Throughout the summer, I felt
my relationship with the team
grow with each home run hit by
star center ﬁelder Andrew Mc-
Cutchen, who astounded me with
a batting average that surpassed
.370 for a large portion of the sea-
son.

My relationship with the team
couldn’t get any better — and, in
my mind, the best was yet to come.

Onjuly 8, the Pirates played the
San Francisco Giants in an after-
noon matchup at home in Pitts-
burgh’s ﬁnal game before the MLB
All-Star break. It was like that date
at a fancy French restaurant you’ll
always remember.

With sole possession of the
National League Central Division
on the line, McCutchen belted
two home runs, and pitcher A._].

The Pirates have hit a metaphorical wall recently, and they haven't
rebounded. MCT Campus

at one point, winning his ninth
straight decision. 0
As he left the ﬁeld in the sev-
enth inning, Burnett received a
standing ovation from the so1d—out
crowd, pumping his ﬁst in triumph.
That moment has remained

vividly in my memory the entire-—

season. The Pirates ﬁnished the
ﬁrst half of the season 11 games
over .500, with a solid lead in the
division over the Cincinnati Reds.

Baseball was back in Pittsburgh.

But alas, like any relationship,
there were bound to be a few
bumps in the road.

On July 30, the Chicago Cubs

. blasted the Pirates, 14-4, at Wrig-

ley Field in Chicago — the same
day that the Cubs traded outﬁelder
Reedjohnson and pitcher Paul Mae
holm. Depleted and in disarray,
the hapless Cubs torched Pirates
starter Erik Bedard for nine runs
in four innings.

In my mind, this incident was
simply a blip on the radar. Just give
the Pirates a few days and our re-
lationship will return to its mid-
summer form, I told myself.

Nicole D’Agostino turned away
the only two shots Liberty put

"/‘on frame to record the first

shutout of her collegiate career
in the Panthers’ 1-0 win. It was
Pitt’s first shutout victory in
over a year, dating back to Aug.
28, 2011, when they defeated the
Delaware Blue Hens 1-0.

“(The shutout) felt great. It
was really good to get that first
one of the year,” D’Agostino said.
“Obviously, it had been a long
time since we were able to shut

someone out. It felt better that
it was 1-0, too, because they put
a lot of pressure on us in the
second half, and we were able

collected a teammate’s blocked
shot and put the ball inside the
left post.

“The shot actually deflected
off of Morgan [Sharick] and
into the goal,” D’Agostino said.

” “It was about as unlucky as you

could get.”

D’Agostino made four saves,
and Charlebois, DelleFemine,
Roosa Arvas and Lauren Yobbi
each registered a shot on goal.

Despite the loss, the Pan-
thers insist they will be ready
for Thursday.

“We have a willingness to
compete that wasn’t there [last
season]. We would get down on
ourselves, and the games would
spiral out of control,” Cuba said.
“We don’t have that this year.
Each game, a different aspect
is strongest. Players pick each
other up, and we have had suc-
cess, and we seem to step up in
the bigger games.”

Dﬁgostino agreed.

“We need to keep the men-
tality that we’Ve had all year.
It has brought us this far,” she
said. “We need to respect our Big
East opponents, but we can’t be
scared by them. Marquette has
made a couple Big East finals
appearances, but we can’t think
about that. We just need to play
our game.”

Unfortunately, things just
didn’t work out.

In August, the Buccos went 11-
17, losing much of the offensive
power the team discovered in]une
and July. After watching the team
display the same ineptitude they’ve
shown in my eight years as a fan,
I had trouble overcoming my own
skepticism.

And last week, we had our pro-
verbial “falling out.”

Last Friday, the Pirates once
again suffered a devastating loss to
the Cubs, falling 12-2 and commit-
ting seven errors — the most com-
mitted by the team in more than 25
years. And although he obviously
wasn’t completely responsible for
the loss, Burnett — who restored
my faith in this baseball team ear-
lier in the season — struggled, al-
lowing three earned runs on eight
hits in ﬁve innings.

The damage to our relationship
was irreparable after that game.

So with the saying “there are
plenty of ﬁsh in the sea” in mind,
I moved on. But unfortunately for
me, the next ﬁsh I reeled in likes
playing hard to get.
