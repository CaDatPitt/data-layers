Pittsburgh "and the _seaboard. All
that was west of the Alleghenies was
described as a ~‘wil1de'rne1ss,’ “one
boundlessf Ccontiguity of ’Ishade.’_ It
took ‘unconquerable perseverance’ ‘on
the }part of the pioneers of Pittsburgh
to make the beginning of the ‘city.
It is not surprising that the Univer-
sity reﬂeoted in its student ‘body that
same _ unconqueraible  ‘perseverance
which is the‘ spirit of achievement.
Nor is it surprising that this spirit
should ‘existat -the University today

ists in any college or university in

Word of Bishop CVVhitehead'% death
was a. shock to the clergy and’ laity
of the church. Many of the promi-
ment menrbers of the clergy as well
as the laity are attending the conven- ..
tion "in Portland, and word of the .
bishop's death was di-spatchedfthere
‘by,-N. P. Hytndman, president of the
—Layn1e:n’s Missionary -League of the
Pittsburgh‘ diocese. ’ *

Bishop Whitehead -"was known for
his many friends among men in all
walks of life, and he kept in _tou-ch“
with the clergy of other denomina-
tions than his own. Among his clos- _
est friends was J. F‘. Rggis Canevin,
former -bishop of the Catholic ‘diocese . ..
of Pittsburgh. Bi1shop‘Canevin occa- ‘ E‘

The _'University of Pittsburgh will

of athletic ethics conforms very
closely to the standards set "by the
