Grahambrings re ect for
tradition to Pitt      

Writteniby Lauren Kirschmon

Todd Graham decided he wanted to be a
football coach in seventh grade.

After his dad left his mom with ﬁve kids
in thesoutheast side of Dallas, Graham didn’t
have a lot of guidance in his life, he said.
Without an education, his mom cou1dn’t
support the family on her own, so Graham
worked three jobs. 7

He wasn’t sure where his life was headed.

Then he started playing football for Buddy ,

Copeland.

V “[Copeland] was the meanest, toughest A

guy I’d ever been around,” Graham said. “He
never said a positive thing to me ~— ever. He

- would grab you by your facemask and kick

you in your tail end.”
But then Copeland would whisper in Gra—

vham’s ear and tell the young athlete thathe

was a stud football player.

He told Graham to stop feelingsorry
for himself because he didn’t have a father.
Graham said he thought Copeland was. the

ToddGraham and new backup quarterback
Trey Anderson share more than just a Texas
drawl. ‘ ' .

They also both have experience with a.

no-huddle, fast—paced style of football.
Though Anderson was slow to join the
Pitt roster — the true freshman had pre-
pared to start as quarterback at a junior col-
lege in Texas — his familiarity with an up—
tempo system and a standout performance
during the.August training camp earned

him the spot as backup to quarterback Tino

Sunseri. _ .
Pitt quarterbacks coach Todd Dodge had
his eye on Anderson before either was think-

‘ ing of j oining Pitt, actively recruiting Ander-
-son while serving as head coach at North

Texas last year. But when Dodge joined the
Panthers and needed to ﬁll a fourth quarter-
back position, he soon thought of ﬁve—foot—
ten quarterback he’d left behind in Texas.
So Dodge called Anderson, a player, as he

But these machines are more than

Hundreds turn out for sororities’ Meet the Greeks

News Editor

Meet the Greeks brought hundreds
of women to the William Pitt Union
Thursday night to kick off fall semes-
ter’s sorority recruitment.
Kim Raguza, the Collegiate Pan-
hellenic Association vice president
and head of recruitment, said that
more than 350 girls registered for the
9 p.m. event, and she expects even
more girls to rush.

“I’m ecstatic. This is the best
turnout ever,” she said about the
ﬁrst event of rush. Students paid $5
to register for the event.

Lauren Jentleson, the president

of Pitt’s Collegiate Panhellenic As— ‘

sociation, said Meet the Greeks is a
way for potential new members to
meet representatives from each of
the 13 sororities before recruitment
starts.*. ~ V
. Each sorority had a table set up
with balloons, posters, trophies and
house memorabilia lining the sides of
thelower lounge inthe WPU. Repre-
sentatives from the different groups
stood at the displays to talkto poten-
tial new members. . .
“Girls can get a taste of the feel
that each of the houses have,”Jentle-
son said. ‘ A
Katie Hart, a senior in Sigma

Delta Tau, said that members of her
sorority attended to meet the new
freshman class.

“We’re just hoping to getsome
great new girls for our chapter,” she
said.

Many freshmen came to the ﬁrst
sorority event of the yearto ﬁgure out
the ins and outs of Pitt’s Greek life. '

Hanna White went to the event A

Towers lobby. '

“I’m interested in rushing and I
really want to see what it’s all about,”
White said.

_ Other girls, such as freshmen
HannaRosenfeldand SamanthaTem-
pesta, attended Thursday night as a

way to get more involved at Pitt.
“It’s a good way to meet other
people and get involved on campus
my ﬁrst year,” Tempesta said.
Rosenfeldagreedthatrushingwas
a good way to “dive into campus.”

“I’m just here to check it out,”
sophomore Kelsey Hughes said.

Hughes, who lives in an apart-

to the event since she missed the at-
mosphere of living in a dorm.

“Iwas never interested [in sorori-
ties] at all, but now I justwant to join

Ahmed: Electronic tattoos
a mixed blessing  

N’ Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
I Columnist

  

Technology has engulfed our lives to
such an extent that a power outage,
like the -one we experienced a few
weeks ago, leaves us baffled, clicking
furiously ‘away at our phones.
The battery, we reason, has some
juice left, so we might as well enjoy
social media down to the last drop (or
electron for you physics majors). Our
generation especially has built its lives
’ on and around technology — and in
some instances, forbetterorforworse,
our lives literally’ depend on it.
Considerwliat medical profession-
als are able to achieve with technology.
As_Dr. Lawrence Altman rerriinisces in
The New York Times about advance-
ments during last the four decades,
he concludes, “  it is clear that tech-
nologyhas accounted forthe greatest
changes in medicine.”
In the past, the medical commu-
nity has welcomed innovations that
. proved to be effective in diagnostics
and improvement of patient life. It
would be rather difl"1cult to perform
.open-heart surgery onapatientwith—
outamechanical heart assumingcon—
trol of supplying blood to the body

in the meantime..But thanks to the o

1952 work ofDr. Forest Dodrill and his
team, such surgeries are possible.
Now, as has happened many times
before, a new, ostensibly valuable piece
of equipment is knocking on theward
’ doors and wants in. This time, it’s tat-
too electronics, ’ ’
Researchers at Northwestern Uni-
versity and the University oflllinois at

Single copies of The Pitt News are free and available at newsstands around

Urbana-Chainpaign have-gdeveloped
wireless electronics so small and ﬂex-
ible that they can be applied to the
skin and left. as a tattoo. Yonggang
Huang, the Ph.D. who led the study
at Northwestern, has a  words to
share. “The blurring of electronics
and biology is the key point here. All
established forms of electronics are
hard, rigid. Biologyis soft, elastic. It’s

. two diiferentworlds. We found away

to truly integrate them.”

The tattoo attaches to the skin
without glue or tape. Simply put, Van
der Waals forces -— the natural forces
that exist between atoms at the mo-
lecular level ——- are enough. There-
fore, the marks are easy to remove.
The hope isthatifthis ideadid develop
into new medical technologies, the
tattoos would replace clunky outdated

— equipment. . L ,
Tattoo electronics have incred-

ibly wide—ranging applications. But
because of the technology’s prox-
imity with the body, applications
in medicine have been discussed
the most. The tattoo could monitor
brain, heart and muscle activity and
transmit the information wirelessly
to medical monitoring systems. This
would allow for real—time updates on
patients, whether they are recipients

of chemotherapy or survivors ofheart ’

replacements. _

Although what Huangand'his team
accomplishedisquitesirnply amazing,
I think some prudence is in order. Is

A there reallyaneed forthis sort oftech-

nology in medicine? Sure, bulkier elec-

.. tronics and their associatedwires are

cumbersome, and wireless technology
allows patients to transmit informa-

tion from outside of the hospital, but

in most cases, machines like health-

monitors and EKGS haven’t been con-
sidered impediments. Although I trust
this technology would have the best
wireless ability, I for one always have
a greater sense of securitywhen using
physical cables. There are always ‘ﬁill
bars’ with copper wires. '

Another reason for my concern is

security. With this technology, medical

information is beingsentthrough the
air. Patient conﬁdentialityis of utmost
importance in the medical environ-
ment. As the American Medical As-
sociation reminds us, conﬁdentiality
allows “the patient to feel free to make
afullandfrankdisclosure of informa-
tion to the physician with the knowl-
edge that the physician will protect

' the conﬁdential nature of the infomia-

tion disclosed.” As with the certainty
of connection with physical cables,
there is the certainty that information
coursing through them is diflicult to
access. Wireless is just too open.

Personal medical information
has the power to affect one’s social
life, employment opportunities and
even insurance premiums. Extreme
measures must be taken to guarantee
conﬁdentialitybeforethistechnology
is adopted.

Society is always skeptical of new
technologies and thechanges they
bring. This is healthy, as it is important
to question to what we subject our-
selves. It’s also wise notto knock down
new ideas too quickly. What Huang
invented might advance medicine,
but this technology could nonethe-
less have downsides, and must be ap-
proached with caution. I

Students, fans ready. for season j

 
   

After spending the offseason listening to Pitt head coach Todd Grah

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ'Wri ter

After the departure of Dave
Wannstedt and the brief hiring of
Michael Haywood sparked a media
frenzy, the news of former Tulsa
head coach Todd Graham’s selec-
tion as Pitt’s 2011-season football
head coach passed quietly in com-
parison.

But the coaching transition
came as a relief to many fans, a sig-
nal that the Panthers could ﬁnally
begin preparing for next season.

“When I was home this summer,
I was talking to a couple of college
football fans who asked me about
Wannstedt,” Pitt junior Elizabeth
Weisel said. “They were surprised
whenl told them that Wannstedt
wasn’t the coach anymore. But I
think that the low—key change will
help the team focus on their tech-

‘ nique and their training, which is,

in the end, what wins games.”
‘New head coach Todd Graham

will debut at Heinz Field tomor- '

row in‘a matchup that fans have
been anticipating since his arrival

“I feel like Graham wasn’t rec-

- Keaney said. “They promoted the

change a little bit in the beginning,
but mostly it seemed like the news
ﬂew under the radar.”

Under the radar or not, Graham
promised to win games and said
he realizes how important the stu.-
dents are to the success of his ‘team
at Heinz Field.

In a press release released short-

ly after his hire, Graham called Pitt, ‘
students the “driving spirit behind .

the Panthers.” .
“Our players and coaches need

Tuarnleiytakes

Staﬁ” Writer

Even the most high—octane of- '

fense begins with a snap. In

_ Todd Graham’s offense,‘that
snap will happen atleast once-

every 18 seconds. .
In order for‘ the offense to
move at that pace and to score

- as many points, each snap must

be quick andfclean. _

At Pitt, the man responsible
‘for starting” the play is Ryan
Turnley —— an ‘adjustment for
the junior who played on the
special teams and served as a.
backup left guard lastyear.

“There’s a lot more to it than
just snapping the ball,” Pitt
offensive line coach Spencer
Leftwich said. “It’s something

you have to -dogandj get used
to. There’s timeswhen some-"
one’s on you. You have to be the
leaderof the offensive line and '

make calls and adjustments.”
Coming intovcamp this Au-
gust, the Panther coaches chal-
lenged Turnleyto step up and
win the job at center. Last year’s

center, Alex-Karabin, was a red-

shirt senior whose ‘experience
at the position gave Pitt a reli-
able presence on the offensive

line. After he graduated, coaches

were looking for someone who
could_handle the pressure of a
high-octane offense. Although
senior Chrisjacobson was a po-
tential candidate, the coaching
staff preferred that he stay at
guard, where he started every

game last season.

“We have really. pushed" Ryan
Turnley to ‘develop because we’
feel Chris ]acobson’s best posi-
tion is left guard,” Graham said
at a post-practice press con-

ference in August. “The thing a
I worry most about iispgetting ..
good ‘snapsand taking care of .

the ball.” '  V .  .-
~ The main goal is to put the

l

best five playersup front on the

offensive line, Leftwich said.” .
B_ut,it all starts when you sn'ap_ '

the ball.” ‘ V
Turnley’s start at center was

a little shaky in the beginning,‘

as he struggled to adapt to his
job of snapping the ball in the
new system. But‘ that’s to be
I expected, as Grahamjsaid it’s a
problem that also occurred dur-

- ing his time as the head‘ coach of

Rice and Tulsa.

“The otherthing that contrib- '

utes is what we do on defense,”
Graham said. “You have a guy
standing over himevery down,
attacking him.”

In the team’s first_scrimmage,
the team had four mishandled
snaps. ’ Graham said they oc-

‘ curred when Turn.ley’s adrena-
. line caused him to snap the ball
too ﬁrmly. . _

mer Coach Turner Gill to Kansas,

Buffalo lostits ﬁnal seven games

and averaged”10.6 points in those
games, which included a 42-0 shut-
out loss at home to Temple.
“We’ve really made some im-
provements on the offensive line
and at the quarterback_ position,”

coach Jeff Quinn said at the Mid-
American Conference’s media day.
“And our best position has been
our wide receiver corps. I’m as ex-
cited about that group as I’ve been
about anybody.”

Last week, Quinn named ﬁfth-
year senior Chazz Anderson the
starting quarterback for the sea-
son opener at Pitt. Anderson,
who transferred from Cincinnati,
beat out junior Jerry Davis and
sophomore Alex Zordich for the
job. He appeared in games against»
South Florida and Syracuse for the
Bearcats last season.

Sept. 10, 1 p.m.'vs. Maine (4-7,
3-SCAA)

 

The Black Bears compete in the

Colonial-Athletic Association of '

the Football Championship Sub-
division,“ formerly Division I—AA.
Maine’s conference has knocked
off 10 BCS programs in the past
ﬁve years, but the Black Bears
themselves haven’t done so since
2004, when they defeated Missis-
sippi State. S’ '

Maine returns nine starters on
offense and six on defense, and it
was ranked ninth in the confer-
ence’s preseason poll.

“It’s about what you’ve done,”
coach Jack Cosgrove said at the
CAA’s media day. “Our perfor-
mance last year was not the type of
performance that allows you to be
successful in this league. We turned
the ball over, penalties, lack of dis-
cipline inkey situations.”

Sept. 17, noon at Iowa (8-5, 4-4

Big Ten)

 

Only Ohio State had a better
rush defense and allowed fewer
points per game than Iowa in the
Big Ten last season.

Junior James Vandenberg
takes over at quarterback for the
Hawkeyes, who lost six starters
on each side of the ball from last
year’s team. ‘ .

Leading rusher Adam Robin-
son transferred to Mirjinesota Du-
luth in mid-August. Robinson was
suspended from last year’s Insight

Bowl win for undisclosed viola- -

tions, and he was kicked off the
team after an arrest for marijuana
possessionkon the eve of the game.
Marcus Coker, who averaged 5.5
yards per carry last season and
rushed for 219 in the bowl, starts
in his place.

The Hawkeyes fell short in sev-
eral high—proﬁle home games last

V fall, losing to Wisconsin 31-30 in

October and Ohio State 20-17 in
November.  '

Sept. 24, noon vs. No. 16 Notre
-Dame (8-5) ' ‘

High expectations abound in
South Bend, where the Fighting
Irish beat Pitt last October, 23-
17. Last week, Coach Brian Kelly
named oft-injured senior Dayne
Crist the starting quarterback over
sophomore Tommy Rees, who led
the team to four consecutive wins
to end last season.

Off-the-ﬁeld issues overshad-
owed on-ﬁeld improvements dur-
ing the offseason. The program
indeﬁnitely suspended wide re-
ceiver Michael Floyd in March for
a drunk-driving citation, reinstat-

1,025 receiving yards and 12 touch-
downs last year. s

“I think [the pro-style offense] ﬁts our

ence at Rutgers’ media’ day. “We’re going to
have big plays in the pass game, but at the
heart of the liflatter is, you got to be able to

Satfdwichéd within Pitt’s conference

season.

The Utes move to the newly named Pac-
12 this year, where the door is wide open
for someone to claim a South Division title
thanks to No. 25 USC’s- ineligibility. Offensive
coordinator Norm Chow installed the West
Coast offense to replace’Utah’s old spread
attack, which went cold in losses to TCU,
Notre Dame and Boise State last year.

As Pitt might remember from last season,
it’s tough to get a hand on quarterback Jor-
dan Wynn. The Utes’ strong‘ offensive line
held the Panthers to zero sacks in their meet-
ing last year, and Wynn has been taken down
just 13 times in the past two seasons.

Although the Huskies earned their ﬁrst
B_CS bowl bid last year, the departures of
coach Randy Edsall, star running back_]or—
dan Todman and quarterbacks Zach Frazer
and Cody Endres puts them back at the start-

“Right now we are just looking to ﬁnd
out who the starter [at quarterback] is,” new
coach Paul Pasqualonisaid at Connecticut’s
media day. “We haven’t ruled out a thing.
We’re going to play the guys all the way’
around, including the quarterback position.
We’re going to play the people that we feel
can be productive and help us win.” '

Picked by many to ﬁnish near the bottom
of the Big East, P_asqualoni, who coached .
Syracuse for 14 seasons, has nine return-
ing starters on defense to work with. The
Huskies committed the fewest penalties
and had the most interceptions in the Big

Anderson ran   no-huddle  
offense in high school

Anderson 4 1

So Dodge called Anderson, a player, as he
said, he thought the world oﬁ At the time, An-
derson was headed for Tyler Junior College
but after more talks and a visit to campus,
Anderson joined the Pitt program with little
fanfare injuly as a preferred walk— on. b

With three signal callers ahead of him on
the depth chart, he expected to redshirt.

This Saturday, he’s No. 2.

“Had I stayed [at North Texas], he would
have been an offer guy for us,” Dodge said.
“So I knew about him. I saw him play a couple
times in the playoffs. I saw him play in the state

_ championship game.”

That state championship game —.— Ander-
son’s Pearland squad against reigning charn—

pion Euless Trinity in front of 43,321 people "

at Cowboys Stadium —— received national at-
tention for a play that Pearland coach Tony
Heath called “Dead Man.” ~ »
“Dead Man” had Anderson feign confusion
over a play call. The center — the only lineman

' in a three-point stance — snapped the ball to

him as both sides stood idle except for wide
receiver Samuel Ukwuachu. Anderson calmly
hit a streaking Ukwuachu for the touchdown,

and Pearland won, 28-24.

Video of the trick play has over 3.4 million
views on YouTube. .

After an August that saw Graham and his
coaching staff swoon over Anderson’s man-
agement of Pitt’s new playbook, Graham an-
nounced on Monday what had been speculated

for over a week: that the true freshman out of V

Texas’ Pearland High School would serve as
the backup to redshirt junior Suriseri. I
‘ Anderson said he 'would_ have deﬁnitely
started at junior college, but didn’t know where
he would land on Pitt’s depth chart. ”You could
be anywhere from the fourth string to the back-
up,” he said. “I just came in with the mindset
of competing and just doing the best I. can.
Whatever spot I would get, I would deserve it,
however hard I tried. Coming in and working
hard, I think I’ve earned that spot!-’ ’

While returning Panthers had to switch
from former head coach Dave Wannstedt’s pro-

. style game plan to Graham’s up—tempo system, _

Anderson arrived in August with nothing to
adapt to ‘— his high school ran the same type
of offense as Graham. - .  1- ,
“It’s perfect,” Anderson said. “We ran al-
most the exact same offense in high school,

i just different terminology.I really feel com-

fortable with the high—tempo, high-octane,

allthatstuff.” 1 A . p  -—
Dodge, .too, called it a perfect fit‘; In prac-

tices earlier this month, Graham paused to

take note of how adept Anderson’s handling .'

of his playbook was.

“I’ve been amazed,’_’ Graham said in a press ‘

conference after an Aug. 18 practice. “ I’ve
watched him lining up the receivers: ‘Hey, you

need to be plus—two off the hash.’  going,

_ little longer.”

‘How does he know what he’s doing? He just
got here.”’ I '

Soon after corning to Pitt, Anderson found
himselfin abattle with redshirt freshman Mark
Myers for the backup spot. Anthony Gonzalez,
the No. 2 in spring practice, was suspended
in May, opening the door for Anderson and
Myers. '

Gonzalez was suspended after he was
charged with possession of marijuana and false
identiﬁcation as well as underage drinking
in May,

Myers, though, had a several—month head
start.

V “I don’t think [Anderson] had an advantage
because everyone else had spring reps in this
offense,” Dodge said. “But big picture, being
a no-huddle quarterback, being in shotgun

‘his whole life, he’s been running a similar of-

fense in a no-huddle fashion since he was in
the seventh grade.”

Anderson won the competition.

“Trey Anderson and Mark Myers have
battled .tremendously through camp, so we
have a lot of conﬁdence in both those guys,”
Graham said at a press conference Monday.
“Markhas a tremendous arm and is a great
thrower. He is accurate with the deep ball
and can really do all the things in the pass-
ing game. Trey does a great job operating,
very‘ accurate with his intermediate passing
game and can throw the ball as well; The
first guy if something happened would be

“A guy like Tino, he has all the experience,” .

Anderson said. “He can give me some valuable
hints and tips. He’s actually helped me out a
lot, just in two weeks. He’s a good guy that I
can count on for information, so he’s really

Anderson threw for 2,898 yards and 25
touchdowns with four interceptions in his
senior season. He also rushed for 44d yards
and six touchdowns. ' ‘

But even with a no-huddle background, I

Dodge  didn’t think Anderson would adapt

so quickly as a true freshman. Partly ‘because

of his height and weight‘-— he hit the scales at

E .150 pounds in highschool — no major recruit-
’ ing service had himhigher than two stars, and

Scout had him unrated. '
“His skill set is tailor-made for what we
do,” Dodge said. “To say that I expected him

Grahamfocuses on old—fashioned values off ﬁeld

Graham 4 11

He took the long road to the position —
Pitt first hired Michael Haywood to take over
after former head coach Dave Wannstedt re-
signed under pressure.

But on Dec. 31, less than two weeks after
the University hired Haywood, he was ar-
rested on domestic battery charges against
the mother of his child.

Pitt ﬁred Haywood onjan. 1. The Univer—
sity hired Graham onjan. 10.

“His innovative, creative and energized
approach to football makes him an exciting
leader for our program,” Pitt Athletic Direc-
tor Steve Pederson said in a University news
release. “He has a proven track record of suc-
cess at all levels of football and his wealth of
experience on both sides of the ball gives him
a unique set of credentials.”

Everything surrounding the job just kept
falling into place, Graham said.

“It seemed like every time we turned
around, that’s what happened,” he said. “I
was real excited when this job ﬁrst came open
because I knew the potential it had. Then I was
kind of like, ‘Oh well, okay.’ I was a little bit
disappointed, and I thought it wasn’t meant
to be. And then it ‘came back around and it
really became a better job.”

After Graham walked out of a meeting
with Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, he

knew he wanted the job. He says it was one
of the best decisions he ever made.

Making the Transition

On the plane ride to Pittsburgh, Graham
wasn’t worried about what he would say at_
the press conference. He said he had six or
seven points he wanted to discuss in front of
the media and he felt comfortable.

He was worried about what he would say
to the team — a group of players who loved‘
and respected Wannstedt and rallied around
the former coach during his resignation press
conference.

“These kids had been through a tough
time, and they were hurting,” he said. “What
we bring is relationship. Kids know if you’re
genuine, they know if you care about them,
they know if you’re organized, they know if
you know what they’re talking about.”

Redshirt senior defensive tackle Chas
Alecxih said Graham’s positive attitude toward
the former coaching staff impressed him the
most during the ﬁrst meeting. .

“He talked about how great of a coach Dave
Wannstedt was, which I really respected,”
Alecxih said. “He said that we had a great
coach, which we did. He really made us feel
comfortable pretty much right away, just told

us that if we bought in, we’d be winners.”
- Graham started by talking about respect.
‘He asked the team members to give him a
chance to earn their trust — a gesture that
made an irripression on senior defensive tackle
Myles Caragein. I
. “When he came in, he said we have to re-
spect him and he has to respect us,” he said.
“There is a trust and a relationship we have
to build. It’s not going to happen overnight.

Hewasn’t just saying that he’s our coach and»

we have to listen to him. He said there was
a relationship that we had to build. We met
with him every day and that helped us build
our relationship. It just took time.”

Graham said the key is for the team and
the staff to be realistic aboutwhere they’re at
with their relationship. They are continuing
to get to know each other, he said, and they’ve
deﬁnitely made progress.

“I think the kids have really embraced
what we’re about,” he said. “We’re trying to
bring out the best in each other and accept
the worst.”

Old-fashioned values
Graham stopped training camp once this

summer and told his players if he heard the
“F—word” one more time, they would run for

  

 

the remainder of practice.
None of the players said the word again.
For as much talk as there’s been surround-

ing Graham’s high-octane and progressive

approach on the football ﬁeld, he sticks to,‘

_ traditional values off the ﬁeld.

The restriction of profanity is just one of
the rules Graham brought with him to Pitt.
He also prohibited the use of Twitter during
training camp. He asks players to take off their
earrings and bandanas in the building and not
to use their cell phones in the locker room.

“I think that your discipline, not your de-
sire, determines your fate,” he said. “One of
the reasons Iwanted to do all those things is
I wanted them to understand they’re going to
be uncomfortable. And they might not under-
stand why. And I’m not going to be fair all the
time. That’s part of them-denying themselves
and taking up the team everyday.”

He doesn’t tell the players to take their
earrings out, he asks them to. He said if he
tells them to do something, they’ll only ac-
complish so much.

“But if you are bought in and inspired, if
you know I care about you, then I can coach
you, train you, strain you harder then you’ve
ever been in your life and you can go places

you’ve never been before,” he said. “That’s

what I believe.”
The rules don’t keep Graham from relating

,,,§to his players. Redshirt junior quarterback

 
   
 

Tino Sunseri said Graham comes into the
locker room after practice and talks to every
athlete in order make them feel at home.

“That’s a good feeling whenever a head
coach goes out of his way to make sure he
shakes each player’s hand and asks about their
day,” Sunseri said. “That keeps you motivated
and keeps you moving forward.”

Sunseri added that the enthusiasm and
energy Graham brings to the football ﬁeld car-
ries over to how he acts throughout the day.

“That doesn’t stop when he walks off the
practice ﬁeld,” Sunseri said. “He carries him-
self that way as he walks down these halls. It
kind of rubs off on people and that’s kind of
the Pitt way now.”

Graham demands the same of his team
in the classroom and in the_community as he
does on the football ﬁeld, saying that substan-
dard morals and values will reveal themselves
during a game.

“Ninety-ﬁve percent of the time they don’t,
but when it counts —— when it gets down to
fourth and goal and the game is on the line
— that’s when it comes back to haunt you,”

he said.

Relationships are built on afoundation of
discipline, integrity, work ethic and tough-
ness, Graham said, and the coaches and play-
ers are all trying to make each other better
men. ,

“Here’s how you Win football games: You
get 11 guys to do what they’re coached to do
right, the ﬁrst time you ask them to do it,” he
said. “We live in a society of ninth and 10th
chances. Old—fashioned values is what I’m
all about with the modern approach to the
game. I ﬁnd it easy to win if you can get the
relationship.”

Respecting tradition

Graham doesn’t eat pregame meals. In-
stead, he gets a hot dog from every stadium
he goes to. That’s what fans do at a college
football game, he said, they get a hot dog and
a popcorn.

And Graham, without a doubt, is a college
football fan. He loves the pageantry of game
day. It’s part of the reason he said he’d never
be interested in coaching in the NFL.

He also said he cherishes the opportunity
to make a difference in the life of each of his
team members.

“I’m a teacher at heart. I want to teach,”
Graham said. “I like the collegiate level, I think
it’s perfect for me. These ‘kids don’t have their
mom and dad here and we basically are it. We
have a tremendous inﬂuence in their lives, not
just in winning games but in every regard.”

Graham also revels in the tradition of
college football. He said he understands the
importance of respecting the past and his
elders — lessons he said he learned from
Copeland and his grandfather.

The coaches and players ought to know
the history of Pitt football, he said, because
along with the fans and students, that’s what
they represent.

At every school he’s coached at, Graham
invites old lettermen into the’ locker room
before games as a nod to the importance of
the past. ' '

“It’s better than any pregame speech I can
give because they get to shake the kid’s hand
that wears their number and say, ‘Son, go
make me proud today,’” Graham said. “And
you can look at the old warrior’s face and then
walk out in that tunnel.”

Graham said the past players line the hall-
way, some of them growing emotional because
of what the game meant to them.

also a great motivator. for you to know who
you represent, and I think it’s my obligation
to give honor and homage to the past in a way

Football and friendship

Graham said he wouldn’t have come to
Pitt without his staff, including defensive co-
ordinator and linebackers coach Keith Pat-
terson — one of Graham’s closest friends and
someone he refersvto as family.

Patterson was an assistant coach under
Graham at Allen High School, later becom-
ing Graham’s defensive coordinator at Tulsa
in 2006. g

The two ﬁrst met at East Central Univer-
sity in 1983.

Graham was a talkative and passionate
freshman free safety, Patterson a quiet and
meticulous sophomore strong safety.

Graham grew up in the inner city with a
poor background; Patterson was a coach’s son
with a traditional upbringing.

Graham owned a motorcycle; Patterson
drove a truck.

hope Smith will put up numbers similar to
Brandon'Weeden’s under Holgorsen at Okla-
homa State (4,277 yards, 34 touchdowns).

Ryan Clarke will spend time at both full-
back and tailback this season. Clarke, who’s
been used mainly in short—yardage situations
in his career, had eight touchdowns in both
2009 and 2010.

The Mountaineers return four starters
from last year’s conference—best defense:
lineman Julian Miller, linebacker Najee
Goode and defensive backs Terence Garvin
and Keith Tandy. - d

Defensively, the Orange must replace two
veteran linebackers, Derrell Smith and Doug
Hogue, who both ranked in the top 10 in the
conference in tackles as seniors.

“Linebacker is a critical position for us,”
Marrone said. “That’s probably our number-
one concern on the defensive side of the ball.
It’s the leadership.’’ 3

Graham, Patterson opposites

‘graham 4 14

They were inseparable from the moment
they met. ‘

Once during their time together at East

“Central, Graham walked into the room and
told Patterson the two of them were going to
visit the defensive coordinator. He didn’t tell
Patterson the reason for the visit.

“He sits down and basically starts telling
the coach what we ought toibe doing,”. Pat-
terson said. “I thought we were going to get
kicked off the team or something. But come
spring practice, that’s what we were doing.”

Graham said he knew Patterson wouldn’t .

go with him if he told his friend his inten-‘
tions.

“Keith was a guy that everyone respected,”
Graham said. “He was a captain, he was very
quiet, he did everything right. I was kind of
a renegade guy. I knew if I went over there,
they would react different than if he was with
me. Keith was a little bit in a shock when I
started telling him that I didn’t like what we
were doing.”

Patterson said he believes their differences
brought them together.

“It was kind of like opposites attract,” he
said. “I saw something in him that I probably
didn’t have within myself, and vice versa.”

In their years coaching together, Patterson
said their personalities have rubbed off on
each other. It’s almost like they’ve reversed
roles, he said, with Patterson growing more
aggressive and Graham calming down.

Graham said his mother, Copeland and
Patterson are the people who inﬂuenced his
life the most. Patterson especially helped him
ﬁnd a strong faith in God.

. “He was. raised in a church, I was not,”
Graham said. “And he’s always been a great
inﬂuence on me in that way, and he’s made me
a better person from knowing him.”

Patterson said that even 30 years ago,

Graham had a vision that they’d‘end up where '

they are now.

' “Back in the ’80s we’d be out on the prac-

tice ﬁeld, and he’d be talking about when we’d
coach and what he wanted it to be like and
what he wanted itto look like,” Patterson said.
“He always had a vision.” -

Coaching with Patterson at Pitt might be
exactly what Graham had in mind.

“I worked for 25 years to get this job,”

Graham said. “To be able to come in your

championship? I’ve not had an opportunity
