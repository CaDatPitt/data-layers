No Child Left Behind: College edition

New Obama, proposal would place emphasis on career prep and higher education, possibly affecting Pitt admissions V

John Manganaro

Senior Staff Writer

President Oba.ma’s proposed over-

haul of the No Child Left Behind
laws will put a larger focus on col-
lege preparation and career devel-

opment.

Last weekend, the Obama ad-
ministration released its blueprint
for revising the 2002 No Child Left
Behind Act, requesting that state
lawmakers and school administra-

tors weigh in on the changes as part “

of a reauthorization process for the

education law.

Pitt clinical professor of admin-
istrative and policy studies Stewart
Sutin predicted that “this legislation
could likely affect who ends up get-
ting into Pitt.” He said the Univer-
sity looks at many factors when it
reviews applications and that those
factors could include state tests.

“As those tests change, Pitt is
going to have to keep a close eye on

their effectiveness in testing stu-

dents’ ability to succeed,” he said.
“If we don’t ﬁnd some way to im-
prove the early education system, we
are going to ﬁnd less and less high
caliber students to welcome to Pi ,”
Sutin said. A
Pitt professor and Dean of the

' School of Education Alan Lesgold

said that the changes in Obama’s
proposal are not being made be-
cause No Child Left Behind faﬂed.
Rather, the new proposal will ac-
complish what theoriginal initiative
did not. ’
“No Child, Left Behind was suc-

cessful in that it highlighted the

achievement gap between upper-’
and lower-income schoolsand made
it an issue of public policy,” Lesgold
said. “Where the new legislationwill
take off is where No Child Left Be-
hind ﬂoundered.”

The previous legislation failed
because the original laws relied on
an informal, unﬁinded agreement
between states to decide how they
would test, he said. The country es-
sentially had many impoverished
states setting up standards, leav-
ing their students unprepared for
most well-paying jobs and quality

colleges, he said. ,,

Thatis why the newproposal will
focus on a new maxim: “college and
career readiness.”

“With the new goal, adminis-
tration officials are focusing less
on yearly achievement and more
on the skills that students will need
for school or workinthe future,” Les—
gold said. “The new laws are meant
to help states and school districts
think through both what the real
goals of education ought to be and
what exactly it means to get a pass-
ing grade. 2

But with these goals comes a
whole new set of problems, he said.
No one should expect ‘an easy ﬁx.

“Now we have to worry about
ﬂushing ‘out what ‘college and ca-
reer readiness’ means,” Lesgold said.
“It has to mean more than getting a
passing score on a reading or 
metic test. The tests need to assess
the students’ ability to use literacy
and mathematics to address the
problems of 21st-century life and
work.” “That’s going to be the hard
part,” he added. ’

Sutin agreed, stressing another
major changelikely to be written
into the law that involves develop-
ing a new reaction plan for failing
schools. _

“While No Child Left Behind
made strides in identifying which
schools were failing and why, the
legislation did nothing to provide
improvements apart from shutting
down under—performing schools,”
he said.

Under the new proposal, evalu-
ations of schools would focus more

on providing incentives and rewards
to those schools that are perform-
ing, and attempt to remodel failing
schools after them. if
“The schools, districts and states
that are successﬁil in reaching per-

formance targetswillbe recognized,”

the blueprint reads. “Rewards may
include ﬁnancial rewards for the
staff and students.”

Lesgold said he canforesee sever-

al potential problems with 0barna’s ‘
proposal. -

He said he worried that boththe
old legislature and Obama’s new pro-
posal could suffer if the state and
federal governments were only will-

‘ ing to enforce the policies by making

threats and weak promises.

“All of the problems with these '

legislations come back to a lack of
trust between the states and between
the academic institutions,” Lesgold
said. ‘.‘Everybody islmore worried
about other schools cheating with
their standards that no legitimate
progress is made. We need to trust
more in the teachers themselves to

get these changes done in the class— _

room.” -

Lesgold said he favors the ma-
chinery in place throughout many
European school systems, where
standardized tests are formed and
graded locally. Schools from around’
a particular area keep an eye on the
practices of the other schools, and
schools tend to improve, he said.

“It would be hard to establish
practices like that in the U.S. because

there is no trust to build upon,” Les— '

gold said. “Teachers and administra-
tors are too worried about losing

Looking for an end to legal discrimination

Lawyers and ‘legislators say state needs more laws protecting gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people..

Milton Eldridge
For The Pitt News

A group oﬂawyers and legislators called
for more anti-discrimination laws for
gay and lesbian people last night

They spoke intheAlcoaRoom ofthe
Barco Law Building as part of a panel
discussion focusing on the problems
associated with comingoutinthe work-
place — including denied beneﬁts and
harassment — and proposed bills to
put an end to discrimination of the
LGBT community workforce.

The panel “Out and Equal in the
Workplace: Sexual Orientation Dis-
crimination” consisted of four people
with careers ir1 law andwas moderated

 by Pitt law professor Anthony Infanti.

M.V. Lee Badgett, director of the
Center for Public Policy at the Univer-

’ sity of Massachusetts and a panelist,

studies labor market discrimination
and presented her research in a Pow-
erPoint presentation at the beginning
of the event;

Badgett said the largest two con-

cerns people have when considering
coming out at work are the actual act

of coming out and the fear of discrimi— .

nation in the workplace afterward.
According to a study she conducted
from1997to2006,35percentofpeople
were harassed after coming outintheir
workplace -
Infanti wrote in an e-mail prior to
the event, “Ramiﬁcations ofbeing out
in the workplace can, quite naturally,
vary dramatically. Sometimes being
out in the workplace will be a nonis-
sue . . .In other situations, a lesbian or
gay employee might be the subject of
harassment from co—workers or from
an employer and might even be ﬁred
just for being gay or lesbian”

‘ Beneﬁts like health care coverage
are routinely denied for same-sex
couples because of ERISA, or the Em-
ployee Retirement Income SecurityAct.
The act allows se1f—insured employers
to decide if they will cover same—sex

' couples. V

In Maryland, 71percent of employ-
ers provide health care for same-sex
couples, whereas 93 percentprovide it
forsnaight couples, Badgettsaid. When
same-sex couples do get health care, the
government taxes them on their plans
diiferentlythanittaxes straight couples,
Badgett said. She said the government
needs more laws against this sort of

discrimination.
Julia Wester, the vice president of

, Pitt’s RainbowAlliance,saidbeforethe

event that she puts her hope in pro-
posed laws suchas ENDA, the Employ-
ment Non-Discrimination Act, which
would protect everyone.

Susan Frietsche, a staff attorney at
the Women’s Law Project, agreed that
there should be more laws against dis-
crimination.’Sh‘e mentioned one fac-
tory worker in Pennsylvania who said
his co—workers were harassinghimfor
being openly gay. Because therewas no
law prohibitingthis, the worker had to
reference gender stereotyping theory,
she said. Forexample,theworkerwould
have to say that when his co—workers
were harrassinghim, theywere forcing
him to conform with society’s stereo-
types of.

Dan Frankel, the state representa-

S tive for Allegheny County and a panel

member, called this “legal discrimina-
tion” and continues to support ENDA.
Ifpassed, ENDA, which has been

' supportedbyPresidentObarnaaswell,

would putanendtothissort of discrimi-
nationintheworkplace, givinggays and
lesbians a law to reference when they
feel their rights have been violated.

To the Editor,

I amwriting in regard to Giles Howard’s March 17 column, _“Keep theyfocus on yourself in college?’ Howard

praised the objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand and stated that 'it’s the most logical philosophy for man to.
' pursue. Rand, in espousing this belief that altruism is error, makes the assertion that all altruism is anathema

and must be eliminated fromhuman nature. And yet, Aristotle notes that man is a social being.

As an example of this social need, if altruism is abhorrent to true human nature, how does one explain
the fact that human beings still marry and reproduce? Marriage, as commonly understood, is a forsaking
of the rational self—interest for the good, of another, the spouse, as well as‘ for the children. .

One cannot claim that this is evidence of brainwashing by religious or other authorities since atheists,
agnostics and non-religious individuals also get married and have children. Where is the rational self—interest
in that? Tax credits? The beneﬁt doesn’t seem to outweigh the loss of “freedom” in the form of being able
to do what one wishes most of the time- A .

_Also, in emphasizing the rational self-interest,(Rand seems to completely ignore the fact that human
nature is, in itself, ﬂawed. If it were not, there would be no infringement upon the rights of others i-n the
forms of crime, war or theft. Utopia is utopia, be it Marxist or objectivist.

To the Editor,

I am concerned about the potentially dangerous messages conveyed in Giles Howard’s March 17 column entitled “Keep the focus on yourself in college.” Howard ignores the fact
that one’s personal or self—serving decisions have political, economic and social ramiﬁcations and supports the claim that we are just individuals and not citizens, meaning that our
voices should only be used to advance our well—being and our energy should only be spent feeding the free market. This is the same free market that thrives off the exploitation,
degradation and disempowerment of entire groups of people. And for what‘? For the self—serving needs of the folks who invent and enforce the values or “moralities” of powerful and

highly inﬂuential institutions. We are feeding a ﬂawed system.

Q_

The Pitt News asks Portugal. The Man’s guitarist what it’s like

touring with a band that keeps reinventing itself.

Elaine Short
Contributing Editor

Guessing Portugal. The Man’s genre
is as tricky-as nailing down its roster
of band members.

The‘band’s music is too big for
“sounds like” references. Its name,
Portugal. The Man, represents both
a “bigger-than-life” alter ego as well
as a group that, even if its members
change, remains a constant entity
— much like a country, such as, say,
Portugal. 1

Its albums are a throwback to what
the creative process of making music
used to be, and it’s coming to Pitts-
burgh’s Mr. Small’s Funhouse Saturday
toprovejusthow enormous The Man,
“Portugal” really is.

The Pitt Newsspoke with vocalist
and guitaristjohn Gourley to try and
pin down whatthis band is about — it
wasn’t surprisingto learn that Portu-

than to make great music.

TPN: How is the tour going?

Gourley: The tour is going really, re—_

ally well. Surprisingly so, although
I guess I shouldn’t say that. We tour
a whole lot, but we just didn’t expect
the tour to do as well as it did. Over
halfthe tour is sold out so far. New
York sold out a month in advance.
Really, it’s exciting for us more than
anything.

TPN: I have a hard time categoriz-
ing your music — how would you

describe it‘?

Gourley: You know, to be fair it’s

probably harder within the band to
describe whatwe do  When we were
talking to our label, thatwas the main
questionthatlhadz ‘What kind ofband
are we?’ Because within the band you
can always say, ‘Oh, well, we’re like
Radiohead,’ and you think that’s cool.
You think that’s what you’re doing,
but that may not be. The safest thing
to say is that it’s just rock ’n? roll. It’s
punk rock. We basically do what we

TPN: Do you have any contemporary

Gourley: I really love The Knife  I
guess it’s an odd inﬂuence, but they’re
one of the bands to me that are metal,
you know, they are hip-hop, they’re
punk, they’re rock. Everything about
them is so great  There are no walls
to what they do. It’s pretty amazing
they can hold that down so well.

it’s really hard to ﬁnd inﬂuences today
anywaybecause the genrehasbeen so

it’s been really great for the people

the band and workingaround the mu-
sic, much the same way we grew up in
Alaska. My dad would do his trade, he
wouldframeup houses forpeople and

Rock ’n’ roll isn’t all parties, girls and

' booze. In fact, sometimes it’s Ramen noo-

dle dinners and part-time jobs. New York
rock band The Dig can tell you that.

To stay aﬂoat and keep making music,
the band resorted to having yard sales,
teaching music lessons and pedaling mer-
chandise to get the money to record its
album’.

But despite financial obstacles, The

Dig put out its album and made it on tour, .

during which it will stop in Pittsburgh
tomorrow night, opening for Portugal.
The Man at Mr. Small’s Funhouse.

For The Dig, opening for the popular
alternative band is a great opportunity to

Gaga 4 8

It’s on top of themusic video chart on iTunes.

The video, which is almost 10 minutes of
pure Gaga zaniness with plenty of Easter eggs
thrown in, is nothing out of the ordinary for
the immensely popular artist. From someone
who has established much of her reputation
based on her eccentricities, it could almost be
considered tame.

What it represents, however, is the revital-

ization of the dyingartof the music video. Gone .

Taylor Swifttook the prize. ‘ 

’ Perhaps it is her elusive persona, or the drive"

I to understand where Gaga’ss mind is at when ‘ '
she decides to wear orbiting rings as an outﬁt

for a performance. Maybe it’s the rumors that
she has a penis (false) or that she dabbles in
bisexuality (true). It might simply be her in-
fectiously catchy music, but one thing is clear
— everyone wants a piece of Gaga, and no one
really knows why. ‘

are the days when a music video could consist of
girls shaking their scantily clad junk for Usher
or long-haired rock artists crooninginthe rain,
and still be considered decent.

If accordingto The Buggles, video killed the

radio star, and if reality killed the video star in .

the manner Robbie Williams suggested, then

Lady Gaga has butchered reality and resurrected '

both the video and the radio star — and _she’s
hosting a 24/7 rager with both of them.

Say what you will about her musical capa-
bilities as an artist, but it’s impossible to deny

- her innovative approach to her-work and the

effect she has had on the music industry. More
songs are continuing to pop up that attempt to
emulate Gaga’s electronic dance niche. Artists
(musical and otherwise) are practically begging
her to consider collaborations. ‘

She may not have won Album of the Year
at The Grammy’s, but countless viewers had
personal Kahye West moments of outrage when

Stefani Gerrnanotta — her real name — is
exactly thatzjusta name. Few people know any-
thing about Lady Gaga past the quotations she
gives in interviews, and even then, it’s unclear

whether those reported thoughts are German-

otta’s, or if they are just another extension of
the Gaga character.

Personally, I think the mysterious aura is
for the best. At this point, 'no one really cares

. to know anything about Gaga——fansjustwant

more of what she has to offer. In this way, she

truly is the essence of an inimitable artist, and

thatwill give her lasting power. . ,
Sure, people may grow tired of the antics

and general weirdness, butI have a feeling that '
' when people begin to get tired ofwhatever Lady

Gaga happens to be doing, she will ﬁnd a way
to reel them back in.

MEN'S BASKETBALL ,

Oakland has size advantage over Panthers

In the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, the.Pitt men’s basketball team takes on Oakland, which boasts a 6—foot—11 center

Greg Trietley.
Staﬁ Writer

The Pi_tt men’s basketball team
calls Oakland home, but just for
today, Oakland will be its adver-
sary.

The Panthers begin the NCAA
Tournament Friday afternoon
against a Summit League oppo-
nent with a familiar name, as No.
3—seed'Pitt (24—8, 13-5-Big East)-

takes on the No. 14-seed Oakland‘

Golden Grizzlies (26—8, 17-1 Sum-
mit), The game tips off at 2:45
p.m. in Milwaukee, W.I.
Oakland earned an automatic’
bid into the tournament by win-
ning its conference tournament
last week. Derick Nelson scored
36 points for the Golden Grizzlies
in their championship—game win
over Indiana University‘;Purdue
University Indianapolis 76-64.
According to junior guard

Brad Wanamaker, every Panther .

will chip into try and shut down
the dynamic forward Nelson.
“All of us will get a chance to
guard him,” Wanamaker said.
“We just got to play good solid

defense on him and not give him
any angles to score.”

One advantage Oakland has
on Pitt is its size. Nelson stands
6-foot-5, and the Golden Griz-
zlies feature 6—foot—11 center
Keith Benson, who averages 17
points and 10.5 rebounds. The
Golden Grizzlies lead the Summit

 League in rebounding.

“I know their program be-
cause weplayed them a couple
of years ago,”‘Pitt coach Jamie
Dixon said on Selection Suhday.

- “They’re bigger this" year: more

size, bigger bodies.”

The Panthers beat‘ Oakland
66-55 in 2006. r ’

While Oakland enters Thurs-
day’s game on a high note, Pitt is
coming off a disappointing loss
to Notre Dame (5045) in the Big
East tournament quarterﬁnals.

Dixon isn’tlbuying too much
into claims that his ‘team’s of-
fense is slumping.

“It’s a week later. Pretty much
everybody’s 1ost,” he said. “It’s
what we do this week that is more
important than what happened
last week.”

Wanamaker. sees the NCAA

Tournament as a chance for
the Panthers to redeem them-
selves.

“Losing in the first [game] of

the Big East tournament always

{puts a bad taste in your mouth,”
Wanamaker said. “It put a bad '

taste in our mouth last year, too.
We just got to come out and try
to make a run like last year, or
maybe better."

No Panther remains from the

2006 win over the Golden Griz-j

zlies, but one member of the team
has played them before. Chase
Adams transferred to Pitt from
former Summit League member
Centenary College, facing Oak-
land six times in his three sea-
sons with the Cyclones.

“Chase told us about them,”
Wanamaker said..“He told us
they’re a very goodteam.”

Dixon, though, believes game ‘

ﬁlm will help Pitt far morethan

. Adams will. A

“From ﬁlm we can probably
get a good idea more so. [Adams]
hasn’t seen them play in a year,”.
Dixon said. “Often times these

es and win their tournaments,

’ While the Panthers didn’t make the NCAA Tournament, the Petersen Events Center will host ﬁrst— and second—round garnes

Lauren Kirschman .

. Senior*S,taﬁ" Writer

The Pitt athletic department spenttwo
years preparing to host the Women’s
NCAA Tournament ﬁrst— and second-
round games.

'I‘hisweekend, the Petersen Events
Center ﬁnally hosts No. 2 Ohio State
versus No. 15 St. Francis (Pa.) and No. 7
Mississippi State against No. 10 Middle
Tennessee State.

Missing from the list of teams is

6 Pitt, which accepted abid to the Wom-

en’s National Invitation 'I‘ournament

onMondaynight,butseniorassociate ‘

athletics director and seniorwomen’s

' administrator Carol Sprague said that

wouldn’t change how the athletic de-
partment handles the weekend.
' “We’re going to nm the Tourna-

7ment for these four teams the same

way we would run the Tournament if
Pitt was in it,” Sprague said. “It’s still
great exposure for’ our women’s bas-
ketball program.”

' Pitt made abidto the NCAAto be a
host site years ago. Sites were reviewed
and selected by the 10—person NCAA
Basketball Committee. The Petersen
_Events Center and 15 other locations

were chosen to house ﬁrst— and sec- A

ond-round games.

For Sprague and the rest ofthe ath-
letic department employees, hosting
the games means coordinating media
and team hotels, preparing media cre-

. dentials, setting up the media buffet

and preparingwireless internetinthe
workroom and on the ﬂoor.

Most importantly, the Petersen
Events Center has ‘to meet NCAA
speciﬁcations; While the actual court
already meets the requirements,work—
ers have to make sure that the site ﬁlls
the qualiﬁcations for the Tournament’s
uniform look.

“Bench chairs, waterbottles, cool-
ers,- everything  wherever you are
watching an NCAA Women’s Basket-
ball game, it will all look the same,”
Sprague said. ’

From scorers’ table signs to the

ﬂoor itself, Sprague said that when a 1

person switches from game to game,
every site appearthe same. There
are even special requirements for the

placement of logos on the court and .

signs throughout the building. _

The Michael Bublé concert held in
the Petersen Events Center onWedne-
day made the basketball event even
more difficult to set up. Sprague said

ment games

they had to tear down the set inside
the building and rebuild it for basket— '
ball.

Butbefore Spragueand the athletic
department started setting up for the
weekend, theyhadtwo years worth of
advertisingto handle — and Sprague

didn’t leave many advertising outlets -,

unused.

Pitt promoted the event to season
ticket holders in every sport, as well as
to high schools and grade schools in
the area. Sprague also utilized radio,

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers open WNIT
against Mays, Toledo

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team willtip
off its ﬁfth straight postseason appearance
today when the Panthers take on Toledo at
the Rockets’ home court. ‘ '
Pitt (16-13, 5-11 Big East) played in three
straight NCAA Tournaments and reached two
consecutive Sweet 16s
before breaking the
streak this season.
However, the Pan— '

Berenato said, and
the postseason gives

rebounds per game.
Goodall, a junior, is best when playing

with her back to the basket. The forward _

averages 10.1 points and 6.5 rebounds per
game.

Shaﬁr is a 5—foot—7 sophomore guard origi-
nally from Israel, known for her quickness
and knack for running the ﬂoor. She scores
13.8 points and dishes out ﬁve assists per
game.

’ The Rockets

Toledo (24—8,
12-4 Mid—American
Conference) won the
MAC west division
regular season title,
giving the team an automatic WNIT berth, but
then fell short of a conference tournament

_ title. The Rockets lost to Bowling Green 62-53

in the MAC championship game.

“I know Toledo is a really good team
from the MAC,” Berenato said ‘in a press re-
lease. “It’s always great to play teams from
other conferences, and I’m looking forward
to going to Toledo this week. They’re well
coached [and have] a very good point guard
and some girls that-can score, so it will be a
challenge.” ‘

Senior Tanika Mays led Toledo with 18
points in the loss to Bowling Green. Melissa
Goodall added a double-double with 15 points
and 13 rebounds, while Naama Shaﬁr con-
tributed 12 points and 7 assists.

Both Mays andshaﬁr were named to the
All—Tournament Team. .

Mays is a versatile forward who trans—
ferred from Indiana University—Purdue Uni-
versity Indianapolis after her sophomore
season. She can guard on the perimeter and

can play facing the basket, but she also uti- 7

lizes a variety of post moves inside. Mays
leads the Rockets with 14.8 points and 7.2

Facing Toledo’s tandem of Tanika Mays
and Melissa Goodall under the boards for
Pitt will be Chelsea Cole (No. 22).

all, who combine

for 13.7 rebounds

per game, will have
_ to contend with
. Chelsea Cole, Pitt’s
rebounding force inside. Cole led the Big East
in rebounding, pulling down 11.3 boards per
game, including 4.7 offensive rebounds.

‘ Cole is currently riding. a streak of six
straight double—doubles, including a 12-
point, 10—rebound performance in Pitt’s loss
to Louisville in the opening round of the Big
East tournament. C

Furthermore, Berenato said Cole provides

leadership forthe Panthers. That’s something

the Panthers have searched for all season
after the departures of graduated seniors
Shavonte Zellous and Xenia Stewart.
Shayla Scott and Shawnice “Pepper” Wil-
son also contribute on the boards for the
Panthers. Scott pulls down 5.3 rebounds per
game, while Wilson grabs 4.3. Wilson scored

16 points and grabbed seven rebounds in"

Pitt’s loss to Louisville.

In the backcourt, Jania Sims performed A

well for the Panthers all season. The point

guard leads Pitt in scoring (13 points per i

game) and assists (3.8 assists per game.) She
scored 10 points in Pitt’s loss to Louisville.

Both Sims and Cole were named to the Big
East Honorable Mention Team.

The Golden Grizzlies played -

a challenging 0ut—of-conference
schedule, traveling to Kansas,
Michigan State and Syracuse,
which were all top -15 teams when
playing Oakland. Though Oak-
land lost the three games by an
average 31 points, Wanamaker
said Pitt’s opponent can’t be
taken lightly.

“They’ve played some pretty _

good teams,” Wanamaker said.
“They hung aroundfor the most
part.” ' '
In addition, Pitt hasn’.t played
in eight days and has played just
three times in March. Wanamak-

. er said his teammates will have

to prepare themselves mentally
for Friday.
“Some of us may walk around

Pitt also marketed to the Alumni

and see what [Milwaukee] is like,”

he said. “But mainly we just got

to get out there and get mentally

focused for the game.” If the Pan-

thers don’t focus, Oakland could

upset them, and Wanamaker ad?
mitted the thought of being upset

always lingers.‘

“You worry about it,” he said.
“That’s something that’s always
in the back of your mind, worry-
ing about upsets, but we just go ‘-
out and play our garnet” ‘ -

If Pitt beats the Golden Griz-
zlies, it will face the winner of N0.

then we’ll worry about Minnesota

So far, Pitt has sold around 4,300

Ohio State and St. Francis (Pa..) fans expected to make trip

is located about 80 miles from Pitts-

burgh.

“I think everyone is making their

ﬁnal arrangements right now, but I
would expect that they will bring fan
buses and fans driving their own cars

down,” Sprague said. .

She also expects Ohio State to brig .
its fair share of fans from the border- a

ing state.
Ohio State won the Big Ten regular
. season and the Big Ten tournament

ment berth since 2005. (

Mississippi State received its sec-

to‘ the Tournament after winning the
Sun Belt Conference tournament. It’s
the 13th Tournament appearance for
the Blue Raiders, who played in2006,
2007 and 2009.

Overall, Sprague expects the event
to bring national recognition to Pitt, 
the Petersen Events Center and the 0

the games will be broadcast on ESPN

“It’s really an honor to be selected
as a site for this,” Sprague said. “It’s a

ing stature of our Women’s basketball

program.”
