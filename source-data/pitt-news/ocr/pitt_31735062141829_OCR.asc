‘Goldberg Urges Inquiry
Into Campus Dance
Failures

 

Discuss Social Program

Precedent went by the board Wed-
nesday night when Student Council,
iniian effort to settle campus problems
in e, single session, voted.’ its members
keys, decried the inadequacies of the
University's cultural life and set about
inquiring into a rapidly expanding so-
cial program. ‘

A motion that council members be
awarded keys similar to those of other
campus activities received the unan-
imous support of the representatives,
after the question had been argued

for a full half hour. The question of
where the money for the keys would
be obtained remained unsettled, how-
ever, when the meeting adjourned.
Urge Cultural Program
-Bernard Curran, .Mines '33, supple-
menting his report on the organiza-
tion's constitution, «charged that some-
thing more‘ deﬁnite than the “estab-
lisment, stabilization and. application
of democracy among the students”
sho.uld be council’s reason for exist-
ence. He urged the adoption of a.
deﬁnite, feasible cultural program as’
one way whereby council could prove
of greater service to the student body.
Regular open forum meetings, at
which prominent faculty , members
might read papers and lead discussion
of the work being done in their indi-
vidual ﬁelds of study, would be part‘
of such a program, he said. ..

The development of traditions and
intramural athletics he suggested. as
two other means by which , council
could sti-eﬁgtliep. its,pe"siti'on and bene-
ﬁt the students‘ is represents. Presi-

Curran for his interest in such a con-
structive program and. suggested that,
in conjunction with the traditions
committee chairman, he investigate its
possibilities and submit recommenda-
tions to council at a later meeting.

criticize Committee

The report from Chairman Franklin
Kallfelz, Eng. ’33, on the activities of
Student Relations committee met an
outbrust of criticism from Arthur
Goldberg, Col, '33, chairman of Tradi-
tions committee, who vociferously de-
manded why Student Relations com-
mittee had. not investigated the rea-
son why recent dances have failed,
why the committee “doesn’t go into
the ‘real’ problems of the social pro-
gram.”

Goldberg, invited by Kallfelz to un-
dertake such a study as a member of
his committee, declined on the grounds‘
that “there is a speciﬁc committee to
do that work,” and that he lacked the
time because of his other duties. He
expressed his willingness to cooperate,
however, in any a-ctive investigation.

The recommendations in Kallfelz’
original report were that members
of dance committees should make it
a point to greet their guests and chap-
erones and do their best to curb smok-
ing on the dance floor.

To Appoint Chairman

After a discussion of some length
on the All-University dance, planned
for March 3 as a means of bringing
together students in all schools, mem-
bers of council decided that the selec-
tion of the general chairman for the
aﬂair would be made in the usual
manner by them. The six sub-chair-
men representing each of the six.un-
dergradu.ate schools will.be selected
by Student Relations committee, who
originally suggested the dance.

The discussion preceding the vote
on the old question of “Shall council-
lors have keys?” was marked by its
frankness and apparent courage in
talking about a question that had
caused legislators in previous years
to speak softly. Some members were
of the opinion that “we can’t afford
it." Another suggested “Buy ’em our-
selves,” but this was promptly refuted
with the statement that “to buy them
ourselves would be worse than to vote
them to ourselves.” Elizabeth'Heiss,
Ed. '33, suggested that council, upon
obtaining keys, institute the custom
of passing them on to new members
at the end of each year, thus freeing
future councils -from the expense.

Representatives Breene, Curran and
Goldberg were appointed to work with
Kallfelz, chairman of the key com-
mittee, in working out some way to
provide the necessary revenue.

The meeting adjourned when it was
learned that Wednesday night’s rain
had stopped.

For Exchange

Discover Activity Conduct-
ed by Bookstore

‘Mortar Board women’s national hon-
orary activities fraternity, abandoned
its plans for a second—hand book ex-
change when Gladys Pyle, Col. ’33,
reported that the University book
store has been conducting such an
exchange for several years, Follow-
ing a conference with J. Steele Gow,
member of the University board of
trustees, and William F, Leng, head
of the University bookstore, Miss
Pyle urged Mortar Board to cancel its
plans for the establishment of such
an activity on the campus.

Although very few students take
advantage of the second-hand book
exchange which the bookstore affords,
it has been in operation there for a
number of years reported Mr. Leng.
Students may take their old books to
the store where they are either given
credit for them on the purchase of
new books or paid outright for them.

Mortar Board decided that to estab-
lish another second-hand book ex-
change would be defeating its own
purpose and proposed to publicize the
bookstores exchange on the campus.

Rugh Speaks Tuesday on
Survey Principles

Plans for a YMCA investigation to
determine the strength‘ of religious
convictions on the campus were laid
at a conference in the Y hut Tues-
day. Twenty-eight investigators as-
sembled at the meeting, over which
William Edwards, Col. ’35, presided.
The conference, which assembled at
10 o’clock, was addressed ﬁrst by
Arthur Rugh, from the New York of-
ﬁce of the YMCA. After his talk on
the principles behind the survey, dis-
cussion groups of ten men each con-
sidered the relative values of these
principles.

The advisers, Dr. Samuel Franklin,
head of the department of religious
education, and VV. W. Mendenhall, ex-
ecutive secretary of the campus
YMCA, aided Mr. Rugh in answering
questions the conferees asked. An
open discussion of the technique of
interviewing followed in which the
best methods of approach and query
were considered.

Before adjourning, the group set
Thursday, January 12, as the time of
the next meeting, at which Sherwood
Eddy will explain his views on the
Pitt survey.

Theodore Biddle took his regular
Etwo-hour dose of strong poison, while
E Sam Strauss looked: on in amazement
“How do you do it, old man? Why,
that ’s remarkable.”
The nonchalant reply was, “Oh, it’s
a gift.” And sure enough, it is. And
so are a lot of other timely and useful
presents scattered about the dean of
men’s office. Christmas has come and
gone in 801 Cathedral of Learning,
just as did an unknown benefactor

wards.

No more will the assistant dean of
men sail unguided the smog-’scuse—
sea of activities. He has been given
a compass. This is done, a particu-
larly vicious brand of punster in-
forms us, in order that he may no
longer wanter Rome.

Director of Employment Bennett is

inverted megaphone. On the mouth-
piece was inscribed, “To let you
speak louder, that all may hear.” In
order that Bennett might not take up
the hint, a cast iron megaphone was
bought. All precautions were useless.
As we used to say, it was like trying
to cast iron bread upon the waters.

Sam Strauss, of the Cooperative
Buying Association, was last seen
looking for the donor of a. precious
set of tools. Outstanding among the
implements was a hammer, given “to
drive hard cooperative b«argains.” At
present, Strauss is chiding a few un-
willing customers with that striking
phrase, “I tooled you so, didn't I?”
The answer has been known to. come
back, “Oh, go plier trade somewhere
else.” It's all in fun. VVe were just

Carnegie Official Believes
Americans Forget Panics

M
V

Editor's note: This is the third
of a series of interviews with prom-
inent business men and industrial
leaders and authorities in the Pitts-
burgh di-strict regarding economic af-
fairs. The fourth will appear in an
early issue.

 

By Jack Bunker.

 

Those several million Americans
who have found little more than some
hard, bitter experience in their stock-
ings the past two Christmas seasons
-and proclaim that they have learned
their lesson this time, are only kid-
ding themselves, believes William H.
French, manager of publicity for the
Carnegie Steel Company. Knowing
that all of us are a little too human
to proﬁt much from this depression,
and, especially since We are Ameri-
cans, Mr. French predicts: “When
good times come smiling at us once
more and we all have money jingling
in our pockets, the ﬂesh pots will
start burning again and everyone, in-
cluding industry, will forget there
ever was a depression. People will
be shouting ‘new era,’ the stocks will
boom again, and the whole country
wil1 become another mad house of
speculation.”

Sees Another Boom

Sad as it may be for most of us,
Mr. French sees -another big spree
in the ofﬁng, some years of recurrent
good times and then the next big
headache, probably a bigger head-
ache than the one we are having now
because of increasing technological
improvements in industry. Amused,
he said, “VVe had ﬁve former nation-
wide depressions; in each the country
learned its lesson; after each it has
forgot as readily, and ﬁve times or
more it has paid the piper.”

Mr. French sees more technological
advances in industry coming in with
the next few years, the unskilled
worker being steadily replaced by the
machine. He cites, as an example of
how little opportunity there will soon
be for the unskilled, the Homestead
mills of his own company, where there
are now no more than three or four
manual labor jobs. Once, along the
main aisle of that great plant prac-
tically all the labor was by hand.
Now electricity has sent the hairy-
chested mill hand into the ranks of
the unemployed and, since he is un-
educated, into the midst of the un-
employable. Mr. French, however, does
not think the skilled man will ever be
replaced by the machine, that he will
always be able to find a “ni-che” in
life.

Government Ailing

In the opinion of Mr. French, our
government, where “legislation is
enacted in behalf of the legislators,
not the people,” is the most uncared
for and one of the most glaring de-
fects in our system, Just as many
other thousand-s of Americans are re-
alizing today, he points out that we
are suffering from politics and par-
tisanship a.nd that we lack, in con-
trast with England, public ofﬁcials
inspired with a sense of duty and
patriotism.

As for our inspired economists who
insist on reminding us how grand
would be an “economically inde-
pendent United States,” this veteran
journalist has little patience. “I be-
lieve people like that either write
their opinions for what proﬁt there
is in it, or dote on seeing their name
before the public,” he said. “How im-
possible in this interdependent world
an economic isolation of our country
would be ought to be evident to every-
one; I guess We alll like to kid our-
selves.”

Year Shows Improvement

Although declining to predict our
economic fortunes for the coming
‘year because he thinks it is -still
very much of a problem how industry
will adjust itself, -Mr. French at least
had this encouraging statement to
offer. As a representative of one of
America's greatest industrial organi-
zations, he said: “There is certainly
no use for being discouraged now.
We are in a much less chaotic state
now than we were at this time in
1932.”

3. Sorority women captured drapes

The following poem expresses the
lament of these recent pledges of
campus fraternities. It is entitled
“After the Ball Is Over” and is the
brainchild of a columnist of the
Syracuse Daily Orange:

“The rushing talk is heard no more

Above the peace and quiet;

The fancy food of days of yore

Returns to common diet.

The brothers curse in higher tones

And drop their polished manners.
They cease to move in airy zones.

Their bright fraternal banners.

“The steward department takes a ride
At each and every meal;

Remarks no longer on the side
Show how the brothers feel.

Some trouble with the water pipes
Emerges from the night,

And sundry other private gripes
Are likewise brought to light.
The name of ‘Mr. Van der Suytes’

Abbreviates to ‘Frosh’
An-d pledges ﬁnd their legal rights
Reduced to simple b-osh.

“They cease to ﬁll the honored seats
And rate the most attention;
They get no more the choicest meats

“The one who does his duties shirk
Assumes the painful angle.
’Twas ever thus; ’twi1l ever be;
The dream must end at dawn,
’Tis simply fate’s perverse decree
When rushing season's gone

To do the routing dirty work

at the hands of Northwestern three
weeks ago, the Panthers seemed to
have found themselves, and demon-
strated that point Saturday night in
ushering out the old year by jolting
the Purdue Boilermakers, a team that
was considered “on.”

Captain Don Smith and Skippy
Hughes at forwards, Cribbs at center,
and Rus Ochsenhirt and Don Mc-
Camant at guards will complete the
Panther lineup.

Pitt Cagers
Meet Dukes

Carlson Hopes Friday I3I:h
Will Upset Blutittes

 

Next week Dr. -Carlson will have a
splendid opportunity of ﬁnding out
how much backness there is in Friday
the 13th. That evening will bring
Chick Davies and his Duquesne Dukes
to the Stadium pavilion in the ﬁrst of
the inter-city games between Pitt,
Tech, and Duquesne, for the Golden
Panthers’ only game of the coming.
week.

Duquesne, beginning its season
Tuesday evening, had its hopes of an
undefeated season rudely jolted by
Westminster in a 25-23 defeat on the
pavilion ﬂoor. But not to be outdone,
Chick has usurped the do-ctor’s battle-
cry of “win the rest of ’em” and
plans to put that call to a good use
next Friday evening.

Dissatisﬁed with the showing of his
proteges, Davies has benched Captain
Bunk McGeever at center, and Jim
McDougall at forward to try a new
lineup’ installing Irv Brenner and
Paul Birch.

Under the new setup the Bluffitesl
will meet Grove City this evening in
a test match for the coming game
against Pitt.

Even the good doctor himself has
given the nod to Duquesne in the
probable standing of the three city
colleges.

- But outside of the nod, Carlson re-

mains adamant and says,” Well, Next
Friday's the 13th.”

Wins Two at Seven Matches in

Intercollegiate Tourney

The University’s chessmaters moved
their pieces over boards in the John
Marshall club in New York City dur-
ing the thirty-second annual inter-
collegiate chess tournament last week
to win two of their seven matches and
earn sixth place in competition
against eight other colleges entered.

Playing this year in their second
tournament, the University team of
Bradford llsley, Eng. ’34, Roger
llsley, Eng. ’35, Waldo Steiner, Ed.
'33, and C. Williams Phillips, Bus. Ad.
’35, defeated St. John’s College in the
ﬁfth round, 4 to 0; and, losing one
board, defeated Brown University in
the seventh round, 3 to 1.

Waldo Steiner, No. 3 man for the
Blue and Gold representatives, taking
his game against Hetrick of NYU
in the ﬁrst round to win three con-
tests, lead his teammates who won
two apiece during the seven rounds.
The University team won nine boards
against CCNY, NYU, Columbia,

Brooklyn College, Yeshiva, Brown, and

St. Johns during the three days of
Dlay and lost 19 contests during the
three days of play.

City College of New York, taking
its second consecutive tournament,

won permanent possession of the
Phillips trophy, presented by Howard
M. Phillips, a graduate of that col.
lege, and president of the college
league. By winning 25 of 28 boards,
and drawing but one contest, this
team won the entire seven of its
matches during the league tourna-
ment. Jacobs, No. 3 man for CCNY,
lost no matches during the seven
rounds of play to ﬁnish the tourna-
ment with a perfect score.

At the close of the tournament Fri-
day, in an executive session of the
league, it was decided to aﬁiliate as
a chapter with the National Chess
Federation, which is planning a col-
lege tournament during the Chicago
Exposition during the summer.

The intercollegiate tournament will
again be conducted at the end of this
year in New York City.

35-O Victory
Over Panthers

Pitt Loses Third Rose Bowl
Game to Trojans in Dis-

heartening Contest

Pass Paves Way ot Deteat

Holding their opponents to a single
touchdown in the ﬁrst half, the Gold-
en Panthers wilted in the later stages
_ of the game under a concerted attack
of the USC Trojans to lose their
third Rose Bow1 invitation game, 35-0,
Monday afternoon.

The ﬁrst touchdown was registered
by Palmer on a 33-yard pass from
Clark, who jumped high into the air
over the Panther goal line eluding
Mike Sebastian, in the ﬁrst quarter.

During the remaining minutes of
the ﬁrst quarter and all during the
secon-d quarter the Trojans were
held,at bay by the Panthers, but them-
selves were unable to approach the
western goal line close enough to per-
mit scoring.

Pass Starts Scoring

Almost unanimously picked to lose
the game by writers and coaches, and
those who add axword or two, the
University gridders lost heart after
the second touchdown shortly after
the beginning of the second: half,
when expecting a line buck after hold-
ing their opponents to a seven-yard
gain in seven downs, Clark flipped a
short pass from the 4-yard line to
Griffith standing on the Panther goal-
line to set the Trojan scoring machine
in motion.

A 65-yard march with Warburton
and Clark carrying the ball, netted.‘
the Trojans third score. Seconds later
"Hogan dropped a bad pass from cen-
ter and Palmer recovered for USC on
the Panther’s 22-yard line. Four plays
later another touchdown was the re-
ward for the Trojans.

Block Hogan's Punt
By blocking H-ogan’s punt in the
fourth quarter, Barber took the ball

line, and: accounted for the ﬁfth
touchdown of the afternoon, four
plays later from the one-yard line.
Although stripped of everything but
their 1932 record, the Panthers were
not considered as outclassed as the
score indicated. The ﬁne blocking of
Heller, and: the tackling of Skladany

Although the time worn “Vi/‘in ’Em

Dr. Ca.rlson can well be proud of the
basketball team for its showing in the
past four games.

Northwestern, Minnesota, Butler
and Purdue faced Carlson’s golden
cats and the net result shows three
Panther victories against one defeat.

Northwestern dumped the Panthers

Heller, Skladany Honored

Grantland Rice Congratulates
University tor Playing
0'} Men

Even though the Golden Panthers
tasted defeat to begin the year, they
ﬁnished the year gloriously promin-
ent in the All-America columns of the
nation. The latest publication to take
cognizance of the Panthers was
Grantland Rice, sports writer of Col-
liers Vveekly, who announced his All-
American team last week in that
magazine.

Holding the chair. formerly occu-
pied by Walter Camp, who was the
father of All-American mention, Rice,
considered a dean among sports
writers, has nothing but praise for
the University in citing Warren Hell-
er and Joseph Skladany as members
of his mythical team.

“Pittsburgh is to be congrat-
ulated on having two such out-

standing men as Heller and
Skladany.
“Heller’s versatility this year

was remarkable. It was his pass-

ing and his running that beat the

Army. Later his ﬁne defensive

work helped to stop Notre Dame

all afternoon. It is seldom one
sees an all round defensive back
with so much defensive ability.
“Skladany played brilliantly
against both Army and Notre

Dame. He was among the top

four ends of the country,” was

the comment of Rice of his two

University choices.

Previous to the announcement of
the Colliers’ All-Star team of the past
season, both Heller and Skladany
have -been placed on many teams, as
have other varsity members, by press
services, writers and coaches. Heller
was named on Christy Walsh’s All-
America.; Skladany was named to the
all-east team. Tormey, Hogan, Daily
and Sebastian were the other mem-
bers of the Panther eleven who have
been honored since the announcing of
all-star elevens over the country since
the closing of the football season.

Boxers Move
Headquarters

Mittmen Train For Opening
Bout in Stadium Ring A

With a mere two weeks remaining
before the Pitt boxers open their 1933
season, training quarters have been
moved from Trees gym and estab-
lished in the Stadium in the space
recently vacated by the football team.

Practices have been lengthened for
the mittmen and despite the handicap
of space, the results seem to be quite
pleasing to Coach Orsini. The ﬁrst

match will ﬁnd the Panther mittmen '

facing an experienced Temple team,
second place winners in the Eastern
Intercollegiate Boxing Conference.

A new boxing ring has been erected
in the stadium for the boxers, regula-
tion three round bouts are gone
through to accustom the mittmen to
what the future will undoubtedly hold
for them.

From present indications, Pitt will

be represented in all classes this
season, doing away with the spectre
of forfeiting any bouts. For the ﬁrst
year since Pitt has sponsored a box-
ing team, candidates have shown up
for all classes from the bantamweight
or 118-pound class, to the light heavy-
weight, or 175-pound class.

Experience will count little this sea-
son in gaining varsity berths if sev-
eral sophomores fulﬁll expectations.
Veterans of last year, who a.re return-
ing for the present season, include
Captain Seigel, Schricker, Conti and
Santicola.

Newcomers showing exceptional
promise include Carmella, Speigel,
Horowicz, Mihelic, Junge and Pearle.

Train Carrying Gridders to
Get in at II P-M.

GRAND CANYON, Jan. 5.—After a
day’s sightseeing of the Grand Canyon
and its environs, the University’s foot-
ball team, coaches, and oﬂicials, left
the wonders of this scenic park and
boarded one of the two trains which
they will be required to take before
reaching Pittsburgh.

Tomorrow's tour of the western
area will take the members of the
University's party through New
Mexico where a stopover is contem-
plated at Alburquerque; then the team
and accompanying guests will head
northward to Kansas and east to
Pittsburgh, when the home stop will
be made Sunday evening at 11 o'clock.

Though losing Monday afternoon to
Southern California in the annual
Rose Bowl game, the Panthers have
been feted during their three—day stay
in California as conquering heroes.
Leaving Pasadena after the game, the
boys were guests of Hollywood stars
at Los Angeles and treated to a look-
in at the various “lots.” Guides dur-
ing the visit were Joe E. Brown, one
of the interested spectators on the
afternoon of the Pitt victory against
Notre Dame last fall, Kay Francis,
and other leading cinema stars.

Mentally depressed in spite of their
entertainment, the boys appear in ﬁne
physical condition of their eastward
trip. Bob Hogan has been the only
casualty of the return trip-, suffering
a bad bruise when he fell while in
swimming in one of the Los Angeles
city pools Tuesday afternoon.

Name Correction

In the December 16 issue of the
Pitt News the name of the engineer-
ing student who played Santa Claus
for the children entertained by the
YM and YWCA in the Heinz House
was incorrectly stated. The story
identiﬁed the undergraduate as Mink
Black, Eng. ’35. The name, correctly
stated, should have been Frank Black,
Eng, ’35, that of the student who
generously gave his services for the
entertainment of the children that
afternoon.

Fire Damages
Set At $15,000

Blaze, Originating in Base-
ment, Caused by Stove

 

The ﬁre which destroyed the
wooden water pipe coverings on six
floors of the Cathedral of Learning
Monday morning, December 19, caused
damages amounting to approximately
$15,000, J. E. McLean, superintendent
of buildings and grounds, announced
today.

The blaze was discovered at 3:15
o'clock Monday morning in the base-
ment of the building. Mr. McLean at-
tributed the cause of the blaze to an
overheated stove used by one of the
workmen. The ﬁre destroyed all the
wooden casing which covered water
pipes between the ﬁrst and sixth
ﬂoors, and caused considerable dam-
age to window glass on those ﬂoors.

A great amount of the building stone
which was lying around unused was
injured by the chemicals used by ﬁre-
men in extinguishing the blaze. Un-
til this damage and the damage to the
lead in the cast iron stacks is ﬁnally
estimated no deﬁnite announcement
of the total amount of damages can
be made, Mr, McLean said.

Water service in the Cathedral,
which was discontinued after the
tire. was resumed this week.

Why Fifth Hours?

W ITH the second semester and the advance preparation of class
schedules for the school year beginning September, 1933, rap-
idly approaching, the News would like to call to the attention of the
Schedule Committee of the University one change which it believes
should be made in the schedule of classes affecting undergraduates
on the campus. Namely, the dropping of all ﬁfth hour classes from
block schedules.

Freshmen and sophomores in most schools are required to carry
speciﬁed courses in meeting the credit requirements of their partic-
ular schools, these courses being scheduled in “block” form for the
various departments. Because of the large number of required
courses during the ﬁrst two years in, for instance, engineering or
mines, most students enrolled in these schools are denied the privilege
of “electing” the course and the time of day which best suits them
for class attendance. Consequently, many ‘are forced to attend class
from early morning until late afternoon, with little or no time at the
noon hour for lunch or recreation.

The effects of this system on the unfortunate students forced to
abide by its conditions are detrimental. and should be corrected.

Certainly, under such a._ system, there can be no opportunity for
these students to meet their campus friends anywhere throughout
the day except in the classroom. Luncheon meetings of clubs and
social or honorary fraternities likewise are denied them.‘ Social fra-
ternities theinselves, always. anxious to liave—aiid needing badly——
the maximum attendance of their m'embers‘at the daily luncheon
table, also suﬁer by the existence of ﬁfth hour classes.

Most students thus affected, we believe, would prefer to_stay an
hour later in the day, or come a little earlier in the morning and
leave a little later in the afternoon, in order that they mightenjoy
the beneﬁts of that free hour at noon. In time, the scheduling of
ﬁfth hour classes should be discontinued for all undergraduates in
the University; it might encourage many who. now elect classes for
that period to take a_ more active interest in the_campus extra-
curricular life. _Our immediate concern, however, is for students
who have no choice.

Although any schedule change would not be put into effect dur-
ing the coming semester, it is not too early to have the ﬁrst steps
taken toward abolishing this weakness in the existing schedule.

I. Experiments in Education

RESIDENT L-OVVELL of Harvard, surveying the trends in higher
education, remarks that the most apparent of these have been
toward a “less vocational objective, a greater correlation of knowl-
edge, a recognition of the principle of self—education and a general
stimulation of more vivid intellectual interests.”

By “less vocational” the eminent educator explains that he
means building the mind rather than storing it with special knowl-
edge, in answering the demand for more broadly educated grad-
uates. “Greater correlation of knowledge” indicates that the object
is not so much to ﬁll the mind with isolated facts as to learn how to
use them. Hence the student must evaluate facts and try to mold
them into something “consistent with itself.” “Feeding a living
fowl is something different from stuffing a goose with chestnuts,” is
the retiring administrator’s conclusion on this point.

The principle that, beyond elementary mechanical factors, no
student can be educated against his will is the basis President Lowell
claims for the trend toward “self-education.” Here the tutor, an
integral part of the educational system at Harvard, serves the stu-
dent better than can the instructor with large classes. “Self-educa-
tion under guidance” should be the essence of all institutions of
higher learning, is President Lowell ’s opinion.

He heralds “stimulation of more vivid intellectual interests” as
the most important point of all, recognizing it as the aim and despair
of serious educators. The despair, he says, because it is the most
difficult of all their problems in the absence of a strong vocational
incentive. . Few entering freshmen come with an ardent thirst for
knowledge . . . it must be acquired in college.

And then the distinguished head of one of America ’s foremost
universities makes this statement about the students in his own in-
stitution: “Men familiar with the college in‘ the present and the
pa.st assert that the undergraduates, although younger, are more se-
rious than they were, more deeply concerned with scholarly pur-
suits, and have more respect for marked achievement therein.” This
statement, so often made and as often contradicted about students
everywhere these days, is indeed encouraging when it comes from
one who has experimented himself with an educational system, a
“philosophy of education,” if you will.

President Lowell ’s experiment at Harvard has been designed to
encourage these trends. His own opinion, expressed in his last re-
port before retirement, is that the experiment has not been without
avail.

We at the University of Pittsburgh are inquiring about the phil-
osophy, the aims or “trends” of education in our own center, with
the hope that here, too, may be developed some understanding of
the why and wherefor of higher education. The problem, at the mo-
ment, is in the hands of an energetic and intelligent faculty com-
mittee. That studentsmay be invited to contribute to .-its solution
before long is our earnest hope.

(Eallrrg

By Don Early

 

.',-.--.--1, -1 *l‘-I .. ...-..r--i.,_v- »,
.m

The November issue of The Lon-
don Studio mentions the Fine Arts
department of the University of Pitts-
burgh as one of the most distinctive
in the country. That such a state-
ment should come from a. foreigner
when several thousands of Pitt stu-
dents are scarcely aware of the de-
partment’s existence is a startling
reproach. It recalls the old museum
guide who, when asked where the
Hermes of Praxiteles stood, replied
_that he didn’t know and trotted off
to ﬁnd a directory. How many stu-
dents go up and down State Hall,
never conscious that one of the ﬁnest
art libraries in the country is housed
_in the same building?

One can’t help thinking that the
Studio's comment might justly have
been repeated as an item in the lost
and found department of one of our
newspapers. And such a comment
might also have mentioned the 13,500
volumes the library contains, its 52,-
189 photographs, its 1,700 lantern
slides for lecture illustration, and the
281 large color prints possessing, in
most instances, all the qualities of
originals.

Facsimile Master-Drawings

The library contains not only ma-
terial of a general sort found in pub-
lic libraries, but also books and il-
lustrative material which would carry
any student deep into every artistic
channel. In French Medieval art and
Spanish art the resources are es-
pecially complete and the collection
of facsimiles of master-drawings from
all the galleries of Europe are about
as extensive as any in the country.
These are particularly interesting,
since everyone likes drawings. for
their directness of communication.
The print and drawing exhibitions held
from time to time in the library are
a real opportunity.

On Fine Printing

One ‘ﬁeld in which we ﬁnd a re-
markable selection of material is that
of ﬁne printing. Here one discovers
facsimile manuscripts of Medieval
books scarcely detectable from the
originals, accurate in the ﬁiiest de-
tails of color and line and giving an
excellent impression of early printing
types and methods. Later examples
show the development of printing
through the Renaissance at the time
when Aldus ﬁlled Italy with products
of incomparable workmanship, and
when Cellini encased volumes for
kings in jeweled gold. And when we
come to our own time, examples of
ﬁne printing are shown in actual
products and in collections. of repre-
sentative work like The Colophon

typographical slant will be delighted
with the material, while others, look-
ing for more, can spend unlimited
time among the shelves.

And on Modern Art

Almost all of us are interested to
some extent in modern art. It is a
kind of negative interest, or curiosity
in many instances; but it is there.
We see a Picasso abstraction and
wonder what it is all about. Is it
art, we ask ourselves? If so, what
are the artist’s standards? And are
our standards today the same as
those of the masters, or are they
changing? One characteristic of the
modern mind is that it wants to know
as much as possible about itself and
its products. Of course, the only way
to come to any, understanding of
painting is to look at the pictures
themselves. In the ﬁeld of modern
painting the Fine Arts Library
possesses many excellent reproduc-
tions. This is true also of sculpture
and industrial art. Besides. one can
get all the important periodicals cov-
ering all ﬁelds.

A Forward Thought

Certainly we should be interested
in our -art. VVhen were the rough-
liewn materials of life more extensive
and more in need of esthetic shaping?
When were men more conscious of
this need or more eager to bring the
forces of beauty and reason to bear
upon the fault? In architecture, the
skyscraper is rapidly evolving from
mere stone and steel into an artistic
creation. In drama, a man like
O’Nei1l brings something vital and
ordered from present uncertainty.

We cannot rightfully regard our
age as intrinsically different in its
worl-:ings from any other; as always,
man today must either sink beneath
the circumstance or rise above it with
imagination, order and reason. The

-ﬁrst has never been impossible; the

last is more probable, and already
some minds have turned their en-
ergies directly upon the problem and
understanding breaks through. Un-
doubtedly art will play a"signiﬁca.nt
part in the solution. What compre-
hension can we bring to that qua.r-
ter? What, still more to the point,
do some of us even know about it?

 

Practice Teaching

George Gould, director of
practice teaching, announces a
meeting on ‘Thursday, January
12, of all students planning to
take practice teaching during
the second semester. It is ur-

that opinion is unanimous in favor of

This, of course, is as far as the stu-

We Have Athletics in Belgium.’

 

Says John P. Klep, Graduate of Louvain, in Reply to News
Feature by Jerard Assoignon, Fellowstudent in Belgium

Charging that some of the criticism leveled at American univer-
sities by J erard Assoignon, graduate of the University of Louvain
and student at the School of Mines, were without grounds, John P.
Klep, classmate of Assoignon in Belgium who is now attending the
University of Oklahoma, has sent a-letter to Pitt News “to correct

some of the mistakes . .
minds of American students.”

. and to create the right impression in the

The letter came as the result of¢

an article in the December 13 issue
of the Pitt News in which Mr.
Assoignon stated that there was
overemphasis of athletics and social
functions here at Pitt, whereas there
were no such activities at all at his
Belgian alma-mater.
Disagrees With Statements

Mr. Klep, however, disagrees with
his former classmate. “'VVe have at
Louvain a complete athletic organiza-
tion,” he states in his letter. “It is
in no way comparable to your Amer-
ican system because of the lack of
funds, but my government has re-
quested me to conduct an investiga-
tion in the various American colleges
to ﬁnd out how their athletics are or-
ganized.”

He points out with pride, though,
that the percentage of students par-
ticipaing in athletics is greater in his
own school than in schools of this
country—al1 of which revives the
question, is America a nation of spec-
tators? Of a total registration of
nearly 3000 students, 470, or close to
ﬁfteen per cent of the enrollment take
active part in eight intercollegiate
athletics. In the winter soccer foot-
ball is the major sport, with gym-
nastics, hockey, and fencing playing
runners-up. Rowing leads in the
summer, followed in popularity by
tennis, track, and swimming. Inci-

dentally, all this must be managed on
the $300 a year from the government
which constitutes the only athletic
revenue.
Was Active‘ Himself

Mr. Klep speaks with authority on
the subject of athletics, having se1‘ved
on the board of the Sports Committee
for several years and acting as chair-
man during his last two years at
school. He was. also captain of the
track team for one year and captain
of the crew for two years.

In regard. to social activities, the
author of the letter agrees with Mr.
Assoignon that there are no social
clubs on the campus of the Belgian
university, but he draws the line at
the statement that there are no stu-
dent activities and clubs. Instead of
fraternities, there are clubs organized
on the home town principle, that is,
men from one town get together in a
club that bears that town’s name. It
is there that freshmen are initiated
into university life.

At this point, Mr, Klep presents a
sharp contrast between universities
of the two countries. “We are ﬁrm
believers of democracy at the Univer-
sity, American colleges have not the
slightest notion of clean democracy.
As long as fraternities and sororities
are maintained on the campus, Ameri-
can youths have no chance whatever
to progress.”

Both, Mr, Assoignon and Mr. Klep,
are studying in America on fellow-
ships offered by the C. R. B. Educa-
tional Foundation.

Mrs. Ogden Mills Reid, Vice

That many opportunities are open
to women in the ﬁeld of journalism
was the view voiced by Mrs.
Mills Reid, vice president of the New
York Herald Tribune, when she
spoke to the delegates to the Women’s
Intercollegiate News Association at
Bernard College recently.

“There is an actual need," said the
speaker, “for women in newspaper
work, because the pape1's are catering
to women readers. It is the women
who do seventy-ﬁve per cent of the
purchasing, and it is the advertising
that supports the paper, Women read-
ers being necesary in order to make
the ‘advertising effective, it needs
women to write and plan how to in-
terest them.

“The modern paper offers an out-
let for almost any ‘talent women may
have,” she went on. “Positions can
be secured in editorial work, adver-
tising, circulation, accounting, pro-
motion or even linotype operating.
There are 6,000 such women opera-
tors iii America. One-sixth of the
New York I-Ierald Tribune employes
are women, numbering 252, distributed
as follows: Fifty-four editorial, ﬁfty-
two advertising, 105 business depart-
ments, twenty-ﬁve service, sixteen
mechanical, including three linotype
operators.”

Offering another view, Mrs. Reid
added: “Not only is newspaper work

interesting in itself, offering oppor-
tunity for many types of -ability, but
it is the best training for other occu-
pations. The contacts alone that
woman receives through her touclr
with humanity gives the work zest,
life and activity.”

Mrs. Reid summed up her remarks,-
urging young women interested in the‘
work to aim for the highest positions
on newspapers and not be content
with subordinate posts. Women in-
stinctively receive a certain satisfac-
tion out of helping others and let this
instinct drown their ambitions, being
content to satisfy this instinct with-
out projecting their imagination to-
ward higher positions. [Self conﬁdence‘
