Said C. F. C. Areiisberg, counsel for’

J. Alfred Vviliier, attorney for the
“liberals” attacking conditions here,
declared: “Our case is closed. Vt-'e

we plan to place no others on the

Today as the Harrisburg sub-c.oni-

By James Donoghue

“Economic greed and the desire for
territorial expansion are the underly-
ing causes of the trouble in Abyssiiiia
today, and Abyssiiiia will not give in
to Italy though bombing planes kill
every one of its 12 million people.”

Dr. C. F‘. Checlzzli, educational coni-
missioner of colleges in Abyssinia and
graduate of Oxford and Cambridg,

maintained ‘ that before: l.Ilqlll1‘}'- forum,

\Ved.nesda.y.
l-Ioweveiu Ahyssiiiia does not intend
to meet Italy lying do‘-vii it real trou-

ble develops, he continued. “Abys-
sinia believes in peace, but peace
without moral courage is nothing.

We know where. we stand. Besides
having a 1)~?l‘l1).aIlF--llli ariiiy of 500.000
men, Abyssinia lia.-:. been fortiif_vi_iig
st.rat.c-gic positions in i'll(‘. l1l()lll1L1i1DS
in the eveiit of an air raid directed at
the ﬁve internal provinces which are
the heart, of the country,” he said.
The AbySSi.lilallS, a¢_‘(‘Ol‘(llll;.j,‘ to Dr.
Clieclzzli, have been a free people
for 3,600 years and the patriciaii caste
can trace it.s_liiie-age back to Solomon.
'l‘hc- S1a.Ve-1'2ll(llllg expoditioiis of the.

Arabs aiid the legions of the Romans-

have never penetrated into the in-
terior of the country.

From time to time Dr. Clieclzzli di-
gressed to tell about the customs and
habits of the Ethiopian people. The
popiilatioii. is divided into two castes,
plebeian and patrician. The two do
not iiitermarry. A pa.trician upon
meeting another patrician salutes him
with his l‘l"‘llt hand, but upon meeting
a plebeian saluteswitli his left liand.

Dr. Clieclzzli himself comes from
the ecclesiastical patriciaii caste.
Every seventh son of a pa.triciaii be-
longs automatically to the priesthood.
The priests do not mari‘y.

The patricians are extremely long
lived. Dr. Checlzzli is 76 years old,
his mother is 133 years old, and his
father who died. recently was 144
years of age. Dr. Che-:12 zli claims that
this longevity is due to diet:—tliat is,
meat once fl. nioiith and vegetables
but one-third cooked—-and the. health-
ful climate.

Dr. Checlzzli defended the caste
system of his country vigorously,
holding that a hereditary aristocracy
is better than a “ﬁi.rinc.ia.l aristocracy.”
“At any rate,” he said. “it prevents

‘Liberty For Us!’ 600 Applaud Work
-s0f Rene Clair,Leger, At Art Cinema

By Sydney Horovitz
An audience of 600 dropped their
prejudices (if they had any) against
art in the movies, and let themselves
enjoy “Ballet Mecaiiique” and “A
Nous La Liberte” Wednesday evening
at the -Prick Training school auditori-
‘um. Indeed, the enthusiastic applause
indicated that they liked most this last
of the three series of movies sponsor-
ed by the ﬁne arts department this
semester.

Those who could not grasp the full
purport of the artistry or the full sig-
niﬁcance of the symbolism, those who
could not “coni.prendre” the French,
sat back and thought they enjoyed it
quite as much as the others. For here
was something deﬁnite they could ﬁnd

-.a sympathetic interest in, soniething
deﬁnite they could base their reactions
upon.

The appeal of “Ballet Mecanique”
lay chieﬂy in its snap, its verve, its
dynamic rhythm. In this abstract ar-
rangement of pumping machinery,
spinning kitchenware, bouncing tri-
angles, sliding mirrors, rolling eye-
balls, the slow grin of a pair of rouged
lips, and other scenic effects, Fernan-
de‘Leger has constructed scenes of
"perfect timing and perfect cutting. ’

“A Nous La Liberte,” which was di-
rected by Rene Clair, held particular
interest. Two convicts, plotting to-
gether an escape from prison, are sep-
arated and each goes his own way. The
one builds a huge factory; the other
later becomes an eniploye in it, where
he ﬁnds the same enforced regimenta-
tion as in the prison, and disrupts it
only to start a sequence of events
which finally leaves him journeying
“the road” with his friend. The audi-
ence is left to ﬁgure out its own solu-
tion to the problem of social regimen-
‘tation. -

jector. How to collect and rear pro-
tozoa will be demoiistrated in the
laboratory.

What, Again? Well;
Here's Hoping!

The weatherman has won two de-
cisions already, but Marjorie Reich,
C35, coed chairman, and Robert
Willison, BA35, general chairman of
Spring Festival week, won’t say
quit. "

Postponed from Thursday of last
week to the past Wednesday, elab-
orate Carnival events which were
to include intramural and fraternity
track meets and circus day attrac-
tions, have again been set back to
the coming Wednesday.

The Wednesday date is only
tentative, depending .upon the
heavens and comparative humidity.
The chairmen, however, are conﬁ-
dent that Spring Festival Carnival
day will take place before Com-
mencement—which is something.

Four Others Win Approval, No
Prizes In Finals Yesterday
Of Poetry Competition

It was file-i‘qiii.s Patterson and Rob-
ert Browiiiiig.

Pattersoii supplied a. fine. flexible
voice, and Browniiig submitted one
of his less dramatic monologues, “Up
at a villa, r;lowi.i in the city,” to win
the illth animal poetry reading con-
test, held yesterday afternoon in
Heinz House.

li"our other coiitestants in the ﬁiials
were Byron Glunt, C36, Virginia. Luck-
hardt, C36, Carrie Hofiiii-an, Ed35.
and Joseph l\ladd.e.n, C36. Each re-
cit-al, like Lincoln's address at Gettys-
liurg, i‘ec'eive(l the overwlielining.
tribute of complete silence. Only
when Dr. W’. M. ‘Parris'11, director of
the coiitest, placed the first prize, a
copy of the Oxford Book of English
Verse, into Patterson’s hands at 3:14
cﬁclock. did the 60 persons break into
applause.

wl.io believes that Browiiiiig could
have done no better himself. The dif-

ﬁcult lines:

“Bang! Bang!” goes the drum,

“Tootsie-le-tootle," the fife-
were a triumph for Patterson.

Glunt, who opened the readings,
made a ﬁne impression with the tem-
pestuous “Ode to the west win(” of
Pe'l‘l3_\" B,vsshe Sliellev, conviiicing this
reviewer that he knew wliat he was
‘re-adiiig.

Miss LllClTllal‘(ll"S reading of Mat-

the saddest 'poeni’s in the language,”

What Can A Professor Profess?

N A R-ECEl\."'.l" editorial in this column John \V. Siu<lebakc1', l:'nii’cd

States comniissioner of education, was quoted as follows: “Aca-
demic freedom should be the freedom of the learner to learn and
not the freedom of the professor to profess.” This raises the «pies-
tion: \Vl1at can a professor profess?

’l‘he\re are three possible answers. He may refrain from sziying
anything that he believes, in which case he is wortlilcss. lilo n1a_v
honestly and franl<l_v state his conclusions on the problems he has
.studie(l, and win the disapproval of the pseudo-patriots. ’.l‘l1irdly,
he may state only part of his conclusions (those which will oﬁcnd
none of the controlling in't.c1'csts in society) which  1nisrcprcsenia-
tion and dishonest)’.

This places the poor professor in a. terrible prcclicamcut. ’.l‘hc
first alte1‘11atiive is not only unwortlrv but impossible; even when an
instructor selects a textbook he is stating‘ his belief ilnil: the book
is worth reading and he must give his opinion of it. The second po-
sition is the most desirable but apparently tlic least practical. The
only thing left for him is to tactfull_v present only part of his views.

Students especially should be avare of this and cooperate with
their lIlSl3I‘11Ci’.01'S. It see-nis pitiful that after a. man has studied a
._problem for many years he should not be allowed to state his con-
clusions openly and honestly. —\V'hc11 a professor docs have the cour-
age to do this we should be careful not to niisiutcrprct or misquote
him. We Iiced also to determine which of the tlirce possible posi-
tions the instrucio1' is taking‘ and evaluate his icachin accorilingly.

Youth vs. Society

OCIETY went on trial last week before :1. jury crmiposcd of mem-
bers of a. New -lersev youth O'l',Q‘EllllZ‘rlil0lI. After rlelillerailng‘ 25
m.inu.tes, the jur_v 1'ct11rncd this verdict, which in general 1'c'prcscuts
an indictment by men and women of colleg'c age the country over.
Society  .f:uilt_v of:

1. Employing‘ workers at starvation wagres.

 Illa(l€‘.ql1él.l€‘. instruction to youth on the clloicc of a nmir.
. 3. F0‘L*ci.r1g youth, because of dcarili of jobs, to postpone mar-
riage.

4. Surrounding1' youth with l1a7.a.rds to morals, such as obsccnc
literature and gmulilingr devices.
5. Maiiitainjlng a harsh attitude towarrl ex-comﬁicts.
6. Incomplete use, for rccrcaltion, of public lmildiugs.
Society is not guilty of :

1. Prov.idin,2' inadequate. facilitics for youth mgfcncics.
2. Mainjtaming ina(lcq'i1u.ic €‘lll]'.)l()'_\‘illGlIl' services.
3. Allowing racial and national prejudices to in'terf-crc with

This case against society is one which every _vouih should try for

Stream-Lined Education .

HE University of Cliicago student who was recently; graduatcrl
’ . from that institution with the bachelor of arts rlegree after only
20 months of study makes an interesting criticism of liiglicr educa-
tion when he says he cut classes so often because it would be foolish
to attend lectures when he could learn the same material more easily
by reading texts and other books.

Too often lectures give nothing lwyoliil what :inicllig'c1it stu-
dents can learn from reading. But it is the unusual stiiclent who,
having: been developed in an educational systcni requiring lecture
attendance and cl1a.pter-by-cliapter subject inastcry, can bring‘ him-
self to consistent study without. the familiar daily chcck—up. Prob-
ably no student can do so without guidance.

In an ideal situation, the instrllctor remains something more
than 3. gloriﬁed bibliography. His cluty‘ is to give his students a
broad background and a. ll'lﬂl'.ll1‘€(_l e1npl1asis—not merely facts galli-
cred as easily from other sources.

Before launching myself into an ac-

institutions here in Egypt. The terms. l
“College,”" “F.cole_." “l.:~’see," “Ma-is

That the novels of .lo‘nn Dos Passes

That liberal senators: like Bronson

High School Coaches, Players To Be Guests Tomorrow
At University’s Fourth Demonstration Affair

By James

A. Nelson

There. will be plenty of happy higli school kids going back to
tlieir home towns in Ohio, ‘West. Virginia and Virginia, not to men-
tion the horde from \\'est.ern Pennsylvania, after the University’:-'
zfourth annual football clinic tomorrow.

They'll be happy because they can tell the rest of the gang just
how the Panther offense works, how Lou Little trains the Lions,
how the lied Raiders work their lateral passes, and what Dick

Harlow is going to do up at Harvard¢

to bring the Crimson football t.eam
back into the limelight. _

Besides the thrill that comes with
listening to speeches bl’ H31‘10\V'-
Little, Kerr and Dr. Sutherland, the
boys are going to be given an oppor-
Tunity to learn a lot about the game
of football.

The morning program will open at
9 o’clock with exhibitions and demon-
strations of o1‘t‘r—:nsive line play.
Tackles. centers and backs from the
1935 varsity team will take part in
the exhibitions. From 10:30 until
noon the ends, guards and backs will
put on exhibitions. '

Inn-nediately after the morning
session the visiting ' players and
coaches will assemble in \Vebster hall
for luncheon. After the luncheon
Dick Harlow. recently appointed head
football coach at Harvard university,
Lou Little, of Columbia, Dr. Suther-
land, director of the clinic, and Andy
Kerr. head mentor at Colgate, will
discuss practical as well as theoretical
plays.

The blackboard will get a good
workout when the coaches start to
diagram plays that are guaranteed to
upset the rival eleven» in the other
end of the state. Spinners, fake—re-
verses, line-bucks and pass-D-lays that
are devised to outwit the opponent
will be brought out at the clinic and
a lot of them will no doubt be used
sometiine next fall when the prep
school quarterbacks think it wise to
open up the bag of tricks.

Pa.nther coaches will be on hand to
direct the varsity players in showing
the visitors the techniques of playing
the various positions. W'illian1 Kern,
assistant coach, will direct the tackles,
Mike Milligan will have his guards
doing the guard exhibitions, Eddie
Hirshberg will have the ends on ex-

hibition, Ralph Daugherty, center
coach, will be around to Show the
;>;uests the fundamentals of center

play. Howdy O’Dell, Mike Nicksick
and Eddie Baker will work with the
backﬁeld men during the demonstra-
tions and exhibitions.

More exhibitions are in order for
the afternoon program. The ends,
guards and backs will take part in
demonstrations from 2 until 3:15
o'clock. Tackles, centers and backs
will show in- the ﬁnal exhibitions.
The clinic will close at 5 o'clock.

Sun Comes Back,
And Mushball,Too

Electric Flashes Capture Two;
Lambda Chi, Sigma Chi Win

 

After a rainy spell of seven con-
sec.utive days, Greek and Intramural
mushball ﬁnally got a break in the
weather on ‘Wednesday, with the re-
sult that six games were run off in
a short two-hour period.

Both Greek games were decided on
the basis of plenty of hitting and
plenty of errors. Pitching meant lit-
tle in both games due to the laxity
or the boys in the rﬁeld who just
couldn’t hang on to the ball.

In the ﬁrst game, Lambda Chi Al-
pha scored an 18-13 victory over Theta
Chi in a loosely-played affair. After
the error column passed the ten mark,
the scorers lost count of the total.
Ave Daniell pitched for the winners,
and Jack Dannels, relieved by Bow-
era, was on the slab for Theta Chi.

In the other game, Kutz pitched a
line game but poor support behind
him caused him to have trouble with
the Kappa Sig nine. .Kutz-..-managed
finally, however, to pull thegklme out
of the ﬁre for Sigma. Chi, 12-9. He
held the league “B” leaders to six
hits. yet eight runs crossed the plate
on eight Sigma Chi errors.

Michelosen, pitching for the Kappa
Sigs, received the same kind of poor
support from his mates, being handi-
capped by seven errors. ’l‘his defeat
sends the leaders into a tie with Phi
Kappa for ﬁrst place.

In Intramural games,.the Oilers de-
feated the Chem Engineers in an En-
gineering league game, 20-7. Behind
the four-hit pitching of Brown. the
Electric Flashes blanked the Chem
lgngineer Frosh, 9-0.

Then, both the Electric Flashes and
(‘hem Engineers came back on the
ﬁeld to play again, with the Flashes
muerging with victory No. 2 by a
25-10 score.

The Rookies continued their fast
pace in the Independent loop by
rrouncing the Electrons, 21-2. The
Rookies head this league now with a
record of three victories against no de-
feats.

Comparing the Intramural indepen-
dent clubs with those in the Greek
league, it appears that the indepen-
dents either have been sticking glue
on their ﬁngers or are a little more
.-f_ure-handed in the «ﬁeld than are their
rraternity competitors.

With the exception of the Electric
Flashes-Chem Engineer fracas, where
both teams reached basketball score
ﬁgures, the scores seem to indicate
that at least one of the two teams in
the game knew how to keep stray
thumbs out of the way of the ball.

sional haymaker,

Courtmen Face
Two More Tests

Battle Georgetown ’s I-Ioyas Today,
Take on W&J Tomorrow

_It’1l be a. big weekend for the var-
sity tennis outﬁt. That’ is, of course,
if more water doesn’t start coming
down from above.

Georgetown university‘s crack band
of netmen are due here today to put
up the opposition for the Brothers
Madden and Company. The ﬁrst Pan-
ther-Hoya match, scheduled on the
Pitt swing through the east at the
outset of the season, was wiped out
by rain.

Tomorrow afternoon the courtmen
will don white flannels again to do
battle with the Washington and Jeffer-
son team here. The Prexies ordinar-
ily turn up with a couple of good rac-
quetmen and Coach Dave O’Lough1in’s
men will have to keep on their toes if
there isn't to be any sort of surprise
party before the matches are over,

Joe Madden, captain of the team, is
at present tied-upwith the Cap and
Gown show and missed the recent
Duquesne match on that account. In
the event that Joe must remain out of
today’s and tomorrow's matches,
O’Lough1in's lineup will likely be; Bob
Madden, James Slocum, Roy Heckler,
Alex Wilson and James Thompson.

Feely Announces
Tennis Tourney

Winners Of Fall Tournament
Not Eligible To Compete

Let it never be said that an ath-
letically-minded Pitt student who
was not of varsity calibre didn’t get
much chance to compete in sports this
year.

Just as the mushball tourney has
reached its peak, along comes Martin
J. Feely, director of Intramural
athletics, with another tourney up his
sleeve for the average athlete.

This time it's an_ Intramural tennis
tournament, a spring edition of the
affair held last fall. That tourney was
won by Bob Madden, who defeated
Ralph Bald in the ﬁnals.

Both of these boys are ineligible for
the coming competition, inasmuch as
Madden is playing at No. 1 position
for the varsity and Bald is the top-
notch man on the freshman outﬁt.

Feely urges that all entrants re-
turn immediately the blank printed
below, so that a, list of pairings may
be drawn up.

Reserve Golfers
Try For Revenge

Meet, Panthers Here Tomorrow
In Attempt To Even Series

 

iVVit.h a couple more triumphs in their
respective golf bags due to last week-
end’s successful campaign, the Pan-
ther golfers are out to lick the \Vest-
ern Reserve Redcats in a return en-
gagement here tomorrow.

Coach and captain Regis ‘Wolff and
his mates started olf their season by
trinnning the Reserve drivers and put-
ters by a 41/, to 11/2 score at Cleveland.
It has been pretty generally conceded
that the Reserve lads are just a little
bit more clever than that score would
indicate, and all Panther hands are
expecting plenty of stilt‘ competition
over the St. Clair country club course
in the return battle.

Matches with Wasliingtoii and Jet-
ferson have been cancelled by the
athletic department due to the Presi-
dents’ use of several freshman golfers
on the team.

Comparison of sounds actually spoken with those heard,

A cigarette so mild you can smoke all you
want—that’s what athletes say about
Camels.-.And when :a champion. talks about
“condition”—‘*wind”-—healthy net-ves—real
tobacco mila'ness—he’s got to know.

Gene Sarazen says: “Playing as much as I
do—I bare to keep in condition. I smoke
Camels steadily. They are so mild they never
get my ‘wind’—nevei: upset my nerves.”

Other athletes back him up. . . .“I smoke
all the Camels I want, and keep in top con-
