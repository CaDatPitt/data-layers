Well kids, it’s that time of the year
when books were made for just laying clos-
ed, and people were made for walking in

the sunshine.

But with only a few weeks remaining
in the school’s summer terms, it also means

final exams and studies.

A couple of lovely lasses have already
given this some thought sitting in the Ca-
thedral’s Commons Room. They have for-
saken the beautiful days for a little more

reading’ and ‘riten.

UCR Continues Probe
Into Racial Problems

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The University Committee on Racism (UCR) met recently
and came up with several concrete proposals for improving the
racial situation on campus. Dr.
the Committee, offered a progress report on the “small, but signifi

cant victories.”

The Black Action Society (BAS) declined to comment on the pro

posals, saying they’ll wait “until
something concrete is done.”

The first accomplishment is the
abandonment of the Wunderlic
“quickie” Intelligence Test. As
explained by Gibson, “the test
will no longer be used in the
screening of potential job appli-
cants. But it’s just a beginning. A
lot more has to be done before
blacks can flow freely as whites

/into jobs.”

A second positive result in-
volves the admissions department
of the University. The plan is to
have “the Black Action Society
help the admission committee re-
cruit students on a paid basis
from outside channels,” comment-
ed Dr. Gibson.

“The question of evaluation is
difficult and important,” he said.

Robert H. Gibson, secretary of _

“We can’t afford to have people 
drifting away because of the ad- 

missions problems.”

The young and extremely busy § . . ,
faculty member went on to dis— E BAS with the admlssmns °f

cuss at greater length the dilem
ma facing the admission office
“The problem is much more pro
found than people guess,” he con
tinued. “It is based on the unbe

meaningful years here at the Uni
versity must be intensified.

UCR proposals include:

(1) The abandonment of the§

screening potential job appli

(2) The cooperation of the

(3) An offer by faculty mem-

Student Power Discussed At Informal Meeting

by BRUCE LEVENSON

“We want to get students
more involved in the decision
making processes at the Uni-
versity,” Ken Schueler, SG
president, told an informal
gathering of students, faculty
and ‘administration at a meeting
last Monday evening.

The group met for the pupose
of discussing student power at the
University.

Joe Kociubes, chairman of the
cabinet of the College of Arts
and Sciences, advocates student
participation in decision making
directly affecting the students.
Students would establish and en-

force the rules governing their
conduct. The student-made deci-
sion would become effective im-
mediately, unless vetoed by the
faculty. If vetoed, the faculty
would issue a statement explain-'
ing the reasons for rejection of
the proposal. This would elimin-
ate the “pocket veto” of the past.

“Student suggestions have been,

discouraged. stymied. and sup-
pressed. ” Schueler remarked dur-
ing the one hour session. The stu-
dents investigate a situation,
make a suggestion as to its im-
provement, then present the sug-
gestion to the administration

It was a part of America; a part of freedom of speech.

“My father is his own man, but since he is the Vice Presi-
dent, he really can’t speak out on the issues,” said Robert
Humphrey, son of Hubert Humphrey, in an interview with the Pitt

News Thursday.

The reason for this particular statement. according to Robert, is
that “the vice presidency puts my father in an awkward position. Any-

thing he says could effect the
Paris Peace Talks and the present
administration.”

Because Vice President Hum-
phrey was ill, he couldn’t be in
Pittsburgh last week. Robert was
here instead, stating some of his
father’s positions on today’s is-
sues.

Concerning a debate with Sen.
McCarthy. Robert said. ‘‘I’m sure
my father will gladly debate him.
and I think it would be a bad
move on the part of McCarthy."

He continued to say that

is in an awkward position as vice
president.

“The Vietnam policy of Hubert
Humphrey will be no different
than that of the present adminis-
tration’s policy,” said his son.
“Of course, my father has an ef-
fect on the Paris Peace Talks,
he’s vice president.”

In reference to the campaign,
Robert s o u n d e d confident. “I
think my father is in a good posi-
tion in this campaign,” he said.
“Many of the people who were
for the late Robert Kennedy have
come to our side.” ‘

person to another, until it is lost
somewhere along the line.

Dr. Richard Cottam, political
science professor, suggested that
students become more involved
in the academic departments of
their majors. Dr. Cottam hopes
that students and faculty can
work more closely together in the
future.

Student organizations, it was
pointed out, are somewhat illegit-
imate. They haven’t been effec-
tive. Schueler feels that “they
have no power to affect deci-
sions.” They should be given an
additional amount of authority,
according to the SG president, to

increase student involvement.

The rights of the minority were
discussed, in line with the de-
mands of the Black Action So-
cieyt. The group wondered how
the minority rights can be pro-
tected.

No specific proposals were
voiced at the meeting. Schueler
feels that the faculty and admin-
istration were somewhat enthusi-
astic at this meeting. Further dis-
cussions concerning student pow-
er are planned.

Seven students, three faculty
members, and seven administra-
tors participated in the discus-
sion.

but because of his position in the

race. “My father believes in the,

skills necessary to get through,”
Dr. Gibson said.

A third definite accomplish-
ment is an offer by faculty mem-

- hers “to provide faculty counse-

lots on a man-to-man basis to the
BAS,” outlined Dr. Gibson.

“We are considering the idea
of speed-reading as an aid.

“In the long run, the most im-
portant contribution of the fac-
ulty is to examine the departments
and the curricula and to propose
changes and improvements in
light of the uniform lack of rec-
ognition to the relevance of the
Black culture,” he said.

Members. of the BAS plan to at-
tend future meetings of the Ra-
cism Committee as “liasons.”
They will make cogent, relevant
suggestions and focus the discus-
s i on on carefully thoughtout
problems.

ty of these parties,” said Robert.
“If there are too many deriva-
tions, there may be a break down
in the system.”

A new organization has been
formed by Humphrey, known as
the Young Executives for Hum-
phrey. William Mahlum, its na-
tional coordinator, described the
organization. “There is an in-
creasing tendency to apply pri-
vate resources to the ghettoes.
We work within companies to get
young Negroes into it. This is
true for all cities. We hope to
have a member of the White
House staff to keep constant dia-
logue with the group’s activities
at all times.”

According to th e vice presi-
dent’s son, the organization is to
“present a dialogue between busi-
nessmen and the White House.

“We hope this group will con-

tinue, even after the election, i

Reorganization

by PAUL STOLLER
Pitt News Editor

In a democratic society, the members of a community-
of any community-have some sort of voice in the decision
making process. The citizens of a city, for example, have the
power of the vote and consequently the men who hold the
reins of power in the city must pay heed to the citizenry.

In the university communities across the nation, demo-
cracy simply does not exist. And the University is no excep-
tion to this disturbing national trend. Most members of the
University community have no say whatsoever in the deci-
sion making process. In short, the faculty and the students
are devoid of the power to make decisions that ultimately
effect the daily course of their lives within the University
community.

The administrative structure of the
University is not only geared to “informa-
tion pathologies,” but to illegitimate‘de-
_cision making. How can any decision be
made by the Chancellor’s Cabinet be
judged as being legitimate when faculty
and students have no vote on this highest
of decision making bodies? How can the '
University be called a community when
the highest decision making body makes

 

STOLLER

viewpoints of both the faculty and the student body?

At this University community, the faculty and the stu-
dent body are second class citizens. We have no vote in de-
cision making; we have no rights. And this situation that
breeds both distorted information and illegitimate decision
making must be corrected through an overhaul of the deci-
sion making bodies within the administrative hierachy.

Obviously, the composition of the Chancellor’s Cabinet
a body that meets frequently to map University policy —
must be expanded. As it exists, the information input to the
cabinet reflects the administration viewpoint and vote. This
undemocratic situation can be remedied by creating a Uni-
versity Council. The University Council, if implemented,
would represent the highest decision making body of the
University community._It would consist of the Chancellor.
the Vice Chancellors of Programming and Developing and
Finance, the Assistant Chancellor of Student Affairs, the
Provost, five members of the University Faculty, and five
members of the student body. All members of this council
would have one vote. And all persons in the University com-
munity would be accountable to this council This expanded
set-up would add legitimacy and diversity to University de-
cision making. This would be the first step in making the
University a democratic community.

The second step’ would be to de-centralize the adminis-
trative structures in the various colleges at the University.
This would be achieved by creating college councils. These
councils would consist of the respective Dean’s and key
members of their staffs, a number of the faculty in the re-
spective schools, and a group of students enrolled in the re-
spective schools. Thus, in the College of Arts and Sciences,
for example, the College Council would set policy and cur-
riculum for that school. With this improved situation, stu-
dents and faculty would have an equal vote with the Dean
in deciding policy.

The third step that is necessary to legitimize the Univer-.
sity Community would be to reduce the influence of the
Board of Trustees.The men who sit on the Board, for the most
part, have little in common with the student. They, like
many administrators cannot identify with student trends by
virtue of their positions. In this new structure, the Board
wouldserve only in a advisorary capacity.

Some students have demanded that the tradition of the
University administration be abandoned and that students
and faculty run the universities of this nation. This is ab-
surd. But it is not at all absurd to restructure the administra-
tive hierachy in a way that insures that both the faculty and
the student body have an equal say in the decisions made at
this University. 1,

Members of the faculty tell the students that we live in
a democratic society—-—a society where all citizens have some
say in a decision making process that patterns the lives of the
populace. But here at the University there is no true demo-
cracy. And this “un-American” situation must be corrected
if the University is to maintain its self-respect.

The door of Room 407 in Schenley Hall is
always open.

It’s open to friends, strangers, enemies, and
whoever else there may be.

It’s open to talk politics, to discuss trou-
bles and problems, and to just BS.

Through it, just the other
day, walked Bodahn. He is
Ukrainian-born; leaving the So-
viet controlled area at a time
when a person could leave volun-
tarily.

I HAD MET him several years
ago, when he was learning Eng-
lish as an immigrant at Fifth Ave-
nue High School. He had been a
metalurgical engineer in the Uk-
raine, but he was going to learn
English, and then go on th school
in the U.S.

But on this day, when he walk-
ed-in and said “Hi”, he had a
problem.

He. wanted to talk about it, and so he began in
his very slow, soft way of speaking, articulate Eng-
lish.

“PEOPLE IN THIS country really don’t know
what’s going on over there,” he said. “The Ukraine
is supposed to be independent within Russia (it has
it’s own government, flag etc.), but anyone from
the Ukraine who tries to do anything and who does
something important is never heard about. All his-
tory books are written from the Russian point of

view; only Russians are talked about. All schools
are Russian.”

“They run everyone’s life." he said. as he shook
his head.

Years ago when the Russia segment of the USSR
began taking over. anyone who was Ukranian-born
could emigrate. Bodahn’s family was split; part
of it was outside the‘Russian sphere of influence.
Bodahn. however, was stuck inside Russia.

After corresponding with Moscow officials for
over three years, Bodahn received a notice that he
could leave 15 days before the deadline for emi-
gration.

With a day to spare, he made it. His sister, who
was married, stayed behind. Now Bodahn writes to
her. Sometimes she gets the letters.

‘‘IF I WRITE about school or something unim-
portant, she receives the letters. If I write about
something, like Kennedy being shot. she doesn’t”.
he explained.

“They have closed trials; just recently they ask-
ed a broadcaster to say something in favor of the
government against the student liberals who have
been organizing groups against the government,”
Bodahn said.

“He didn’t. They held a secret trial. And he went
to jail. That’s all. He didn’t have a chance,” he
continued.

“LATER HE smuggled his memoirs and a book
he had written out of prison. He had a lot of follow-
ers who helped. They wanted to let the Western
countries know what goes on over there. They did
it at the cost of life, or being sent away where no
one hears about you again.” he explained.

“It’s just a shame,” Bodahn said, again shaking
hishead. “It’s just a shame.”

WANTED: Cause Supporters

  

by BRUCE LEVEN SON

The cause appears to be dy-
ing. There always seems to
have been a conspiracy
against the cause, but never
has the outlook looked so
bleak.

The cause is the movement
for change. It is the pro-peace
anti-war, civil rights and
equality, anti-cybemetics and
pro-people cause. But, the
arch-enemy of the movement, the

status quo is swinging back into V

high gear again.
This was an optimistic year for

the cause. It is an election year
and hope was abounding. The

I movement had a new hero, Sen.

Eugene McCarthy. But it was
the rebirth of an old champion;

the first champion of this change,
John Kennedy; in the person of
his brother Robert that gave the
movement its finest moments.

BUT THE BULLET of an as-
sassin, the American symbol of
anti-change, stole the life of Mar-
tin Luther King from the advo-
cates of innovation, just as JFK,
Medgar Evers, Viola Liuzzo, and
Malcolm X had been taken to si-
lence the voice of change. And it
wasn’t long afterwards when the
golden dream of the future that
could have been, Bobby Kennedy
fell victim to assassination and
the status quo.

In the meantime, a new symbol
has sprung up out of an old body,
Nelson Rockefeller. Unfortunate-
ly, Rocky’s ineptitude at gather-
ing delegate support has thus far
exceeded his uncertain idealism.

LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS

E/%””E<

 
   

    

   

And Sen. McCarthy’s delegate
winning ability is in inverse pro-
portion with his growing popu-
larity.

It is no surprise that the cause
is regressing. All of its leading
defenders of the faith are being
picked off one by one, or repres-
sed by the status quo.

THE STATUS quo, running two
of its leaders, Richard Nixon and
Hubert Humphrey, is a near shoo-
in to once again hold the principle
position of power for the next four
years.

If so, Ted Kennedy, whether
he likes it or not, will bear the
cross for the movement. The Ken-
nedy family has always exempli-
fied the highest ideals of this coun-
try and the fountainhead of
change.

The last of Joseph P. Kennedy’s
sons is now being touted as Hum-
phrey’s running mate. If Ted
aligns himself with the Presi-
dent’s PR man (i.e. the status quo)
he will surely be driving the nails
into the coffin of the noble cause.

EDWARD Kennedy may be the
last great hope of the movement
for constructive change. As a Sen-
ator for the next four years, a for-
um that Bobby utilized well for
the last four years, he will be in
a position of dissent; a vantage
point from which he can criticize
the administration. Thus, he will
not have sold out the ideals of his
martyred brothers, who gave their
lives to the cause.

Hitler made use of the student
power movement in Germany to
condition the people to violence
and brute force said Dr. Leonard
Peikoff. philosophy professor of
Columbia University. His lecture.
the third in a series of taped lec-
tures sponsored by the Nathaniel
Branden Institute. the organiza-
tion which expounds Ayn Rand’s
philosophy of objectivism, was
held last Friday at the Webster
Hall Hotel.

Many of the German students
and intellectuals supported the
Nazi movement and joined such
violent organizations as the SA
and the SD, said Dr. Peikoff. The
German people gradually be-
came accustomed to violence.
Radical students made outrageous
demands, overtook university
buildings, kidnapped or beat

members of rival political parties.
and finally resorted to murder.
The German government protest-
ed. but. since it did not really dis-
agree with the student’s ideology,
it let them continue with their
show of brute force.

Dr. Peikoff believes that the
same thing is happening in the
United States. Since the civil
rights movement. riots and loot-
ing have come to be expected by
the public. “But,” he added. “the
Negroes have a real grievance.
In the Student Power movement.
the students magnify existing
problems, are systematically or-
ganized and resort to violence
when their demands. are not met.
Here are the future concentration
camp guards.”

“Those who scream police bru-
tality are actually working for

the police state,” added Dr. Peik-

off. The rights of the individual
have become less important than
the principal for which the vari-
ous power groups are fighting.
Said the New York Times in an
article about the Columbia inci-
dent: “Rights of property and
rugged individualism have stead-
ily been losing ground to the
right of individual happiness.”

Many of the other tactics used
by Hitler can be found in the
United States today. declared Dr.
Peikoff. The Nazis. for example.
cashed in on real and fake na-
tional emergencies. In an emer-
gency, people panic and feel the
need for immediate action. After
the World War I defeat and the
depression, the Nazis were able
to convince the people that demo-
cracy had failed. The people
paniced and quickly accepted
Nazism.

Tuesday, July 23, l968—THE PITT N EWS-—Page 3

“Unfortunately.” said Dr. Peik-
off. “the people in the United
States are panicing over a number
of fake emergencies." Air pollu-
tion and economic imbalance are
used as excuses for more govern-
ment control. poverty is used as
an excuse for more welfare, and
assasinations are used as excuses
for gun control.

“There was no intellectual op-
position of the Nazi movement,”
Dr. Peikoff explained. “All the
other political parties agreed
with them on principal. There-
fore, they could not fight against
them.” Dr. Peikoff believes that
the same thing is occuring in the
United States today. The political
parties are becoming closer in
ideologys.

“If you think it can’t happen
here,” said Dr. Peikoff, “look
around.

voun MILITARYOBLIGATION

Every able young American man, upon reaching 181‘/2
years of age, has an obligation to share in the defense
of our country. While you have no control over the
amount of time you must serve, you can control the
manner in which you serve. The purpose of this chart
is to show alternative ways of entering military ser-
vice, the obligation incurred under each, and the man-
ner in which your obligation is satisfied.
