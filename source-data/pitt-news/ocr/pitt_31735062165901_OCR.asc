 SC Success   Stressed
By LandyatBanquet

Addressing 65 people’, at the ‘Student Government ban-
quet Wednesday evening in the Faculty Club, newly 1nstal-
V led SG President. Martin Landy stated what he expects each
' new senator to be: “forceful and_dyna‘mic; intelligent and

active.”

He drew an analogy between the preceding SG Presi-

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

"dent and Vice President Tom‘

Olofson and Judy Diethorn and
the mythical Prometheus "who
brought the -gift of fire to Man.
“Tom and Judy ignited the sparks
of leadership which culminated “in
‘a Student Government which is in
my opinion and in the opinion of
many others a blazing success,”
Landy stated. Y
- Stressing Success

Stressing SG’s recent success,
he contrasted his analogy with a
remark of Ronald Pease, assistant

/Fiean of men and former SG ad-
Fiser, when thepreceding SG took
office: “Student Government often
has a great deal of ﬁre in the
spring, only hot coals in the fall,
and a lot of smoke in the winter.”

Because the new SG is faced
with the challenge of _maintain-
ing the present level of success
and ‘fmoving ‘ahead to greater
heights,” each senator must be
a. leader. “In this new Student
Govenrment we shall 'make the
words‘ ‘senator’ and ‘leader’ in-
terchangeable _and synonomous
in the eyes "of tl1e'_University,”
Landy predicted.

The ﬁrst ‘requirement of his
dual role is to be ,“attuned to the
needs, problems, and desires of
the students who elected him,” he
continued. A senator must look
outward and inward with a criti-
cal eye.” . -

Intelligence Requisite

Intelligence is requisite. ‘I‘t is
no defect of character to be -medi-
tative as long as this trait is com-
bined with other virtues, such as
action and even ambition," he
stressed.

Responsibility and dedication
are other required virtues. Ded-
ication, he feels, will result in
“rewarding and worthwhile ex-_
periences. For becoming a leader
is an educational process and
a quite enjoyable one.”

Returning to his Promethean
analogy, Landy" concluded by say-
ing, “We, the new Student Gov-
ernment, must take the ﬁre that
we receive tonight, add more fuel
to it and keep it blazing for an-
otheryear. Only we must make it
brighter and larger.”

BOOKS AND COFFEE

The University Book Store
will ‘sponsor informal Coffee
Hours in the Fine Books
Room from 3 to 4 p.m. every
Friday. The Coffee Hours are

ulty, of the University for the

Guest Speaker Edward Teller  

Brings Controversy to Campus

Wednesday’s Honors Convocation will honor one of to-_
day’s most controversial ﬁgures, Dr. Edward Teller, nuclear.

physicist.

Two faculty mmebers and several students have written
to The Pitt News and The Pittsburgh

Teller’s speaking here.

Many -people feel that Dr. Teller’s development and
program for testing will lead to world disaster. Others revere
him as "one of the foremost nuclear physicists living.

 To Urge

No jumps
On Finals

By NANCY Fucns
Student Government voted

to “urge the deans of all

undergraduate schools and Dr.
Rankin to’ prohibit the ‘re-
scheduling of ﬁnal exams the
week preceding ﬁnals”.. unless
a professor has the unanimous
consent of his class. The motion,
introduced by Ben Cardin at the
ﬁrst-meeting of the new SG, states
that rescheduling defeats the pur-
pose of ﬁnals week in two re-
spects. ,

First, having ﬁnals a week
ahead causes reduction in periods
of classroom instruction and in
the length of the trimester from
14 to.13 weeks. Second, the time
given to students. to study for

S exams can not be used for this

purpose if the exams are given
a week earlier. ,

An added burden is placed on
the student, because he must at-
tend regular classes and prepare
for ~ comprehensive , exams too.
The motion also states that, “if a
student has three ﬁnals scheduled
on one day in the week preceed-
ing ﬁnals week, there is no official
way to have one test transferred,”
posing another problem for the
student. ,

_Copies will be sent -to every

dean requesting them to “in-
form their faculty members
that the exam schedule cannot
be changed without the written
consent of their respective deans -
and . . . that the week before
ﬁnals should consist only of
classroom instruction.” '

SG President Martin Landy
hopes that .“it’s not too late to
bring about this change now."

The senate approved the ap-

, pointments of Charles Gularson as

executive assistant, Harriet ‘Hersh
as public relations director, Rich-
ard Minker as director of ﬁnance,
and Jim Varner as homecoming
chairman, assisted by Beth Baum-
gart. Barbara McKeever was also

‘approved for freshman outing

chairman.
SG Chaplain
Ellen Stuckeman was elected
SG chaplain and Ben Cardin,
president pro tempore.
‘ Landy announced that all
male wheel‘ chair students will
be housed in Schenley Hall this -

One of the men responsible for‘
the creation of the . Hydrogen -

After those four weeks of prac-

Richie Fireman, returning cheer-
leaders; Dick Stoller, this year’s
head cheerleader; Joe Seiger and
Martha Holstein, Student Gov-

tion. The four new cheerleaders
were selected in the same manner

' At School of Law

Open House Ready

The School of Law will spon-
sor an open house tomorrow for

' those undergraduates interested in
’ graduate work in law.

Members of the Student Bar As-
sociation and faculty members

' will confer with visiting students

concerning careers in law.

Peace Corps

"Assistant Sets
_ Discussion

Joan Levy, program assistant
in the Division of University Re-
lations, and Lenard Clark, train-

.ing officer at the Peace Corps

Field Training Camp in Puerto
Rico, will speak to students in-
terested in the Peace Corps on
April 4-5.

The Peace Corps representatives
will be in the Office of Cultural

and Educational Exchange at 201-

Amos Hall from 10 a.m. to noon
on Thursday, and from 2 to 4 p.m.
on Friday. They will discuss op-
portunities for service abroad.

Students will attend a class in
Torts at 9:50 a.m. and a Corpora-

_tion Finance Seminar at 2 p.m.

Thomas M. Cooley, Dean of the
School of Law, will address the
guests at a SBA-sponsored coffee
hour at 3 p.m.

Daniel R. Delaney, president of
the Society, in describing its
scope, stated: “Beneficial to the
individual law school and its stu-
dent bar association, a pre-law
society is most worthwhile.
Through the formation of such a
society, the legal profession can
be assured that qualiﬁed under-
graduates will become familiar
with the role and work of law-
years.

“Through the medium of the
society, the college student can
also be guided to an appreciation
of the duties inherent in the pro-
fession. Just as important, those
not wishing to be held to such
a degree of professional conduct
can be discouraged before enter-
ing the study of law. I can only
hope that the students at Pitt will
take advantage of such an organ-
ization.”

Leﬂeirs to the Editor

A States

llaze Pitt Stadium,

L. A. Senior Suggests
C Editor, The Pitt News:

While I would agree that the
political hassling over the
North Side Stadium has gotten
completely out of hand, and
while I would further agree that
graduate schools and research
‘centers, speaking in absolute
terms, are far more important
than baseball ﬁelds, I -must ob-
ject to The Pitt News’ stand in
its attitude toward the Univer-
sity’s role in this controversy.

The editor made some sweep-

ing statements concerning the

right of the University to en-
croach upon the recreational
facilities of the community.
And, he generalizes upon the
disposition of “this town’s ‘citi-
2enry” toward the academic

versus the pleasurable, without
"offering evidence and without

fully explaining the context of
the present situation.

These statements show an ig-
norance of the place of the Uni-
versity as a member of and hot
as a master over the community.
The pompously righteous nature

of‘ his assertions condemn the .

public of offenses of which the
University itself is guilty.

The University owns Forbes
Field. And, it thus has the right
to do with it as it sees ﬁt.
Granted.

But does this fact plus the
fact that a certain few political
ﬁgures have seized upon this is-
sue for political purposes give
our ‘student newspaper any jus-
tiﬁcation for sanctimoniously
jeering those who would regret
the loss of the Pirates? Hardly.

If, in fact, the editor is so

concerned with the relative val-
ues of entertainment against
graduate schools and research,
why did he not in his editorial
recommend the immediate raz-
ing of the ugly cement monster
at the head of DeSoto Street,
to wit, The Pitt Stadium?
Does it not follow that this
university property, used half-
a-dozen times a year for “mere?
entertainment purposes, and oc-
cupying valuable land in the

_medical’ center, should be ‘con-

secrated to better purposes?

In fact; how does our editor
sleep at night thinking of the
incongruity of a football ﬁeld
in the city’s medical center?

, And yet, the Chancellor and
the editor of The Pitt. News are
in accord’ in suggestingthat the

University encroach upon the

community at large without

mentioning the elimination of

such academically worthless in-
stitutions as a seldom used sta-
dium, football teams, football
scholarships, athletic instructors,
and- the accompanying expenses
of all these.

In fact, does the University
not have its own doorstep to
sweep before ‘ it makes pro-
nouncements on the public’s at-
titude?

Or, rather, is the Univérsity’s
stand on this issue, and that of
our editor, not based on the
fact that the shoe is on the city’s
foot this time; and would it
not be some_what altered if the
situation were reversed?

Let the university be without
guilt which casts the ﬁrst stone.
Hence:
silent!

Let the University be '

Latin America-Part ll . Q‘ .

Student Independence

Once recognizing that the student in the -United
is a political weakling compared to his
Latin American counterpart, one then must ask,
what are the factors enabling the Latin student to
command such a superior poli-
tical position? Also mindful that
the answer does not read like
an equation of the ﬁrst degree,
one can then rieﬁect on some of
the factors and compare them
to oneself vis—a-vis the political
and social situation in the U.S. '

One ﬁnds that social mores
permit the eight to ten year old
Latin youth a degree of inde-
pendence not common in the
U.S. Not having to heed his
mother’s commands, the male youth can even boss
all the females in the household. When he is 15 or
16 and enters high school, he ﬁnds little difficulty
in asserting his ability to handle political problems.
Ac'I'ivi'l'y Encouraged

In fact, his-elders traditionally encourage his

political activity,‘for they ﬁnd it unblemished and_

less biased than his father’s. When the youth enters
the university, he is respected by his elders as a
student; this phenomenon is of course traditional
and related to the respect accorded the student in
Europe. Because an , increasing number of stu-
dents come from the poorer classes, .‘the univer-
sity clamors for social’ reforms. Adding to this the
fact that Latins America has a very young popula-
tion, one can see the picture of a large and brazen
student class. , . A

In fact, the degree of" student independence
might well’ ruﬁle the composure of many a pro-
fessor and administrator in the .U.S. During the
dictatorship of Perez in Venezuela, if students felt

A that a particular test was unfair, they would march

out of the hall, or decide it was time for their holi-
days. At Cordoba University in Argentina after
the ﬁrst'World War, irate students .demanded the
attention of the administrato_rs, calling for relaxed
entrance requirements, -less rigid attendence rules,
and the elimination of tuition. Stil not satisﬁed,
they decided a review of professorial qualiﬁcations
was in order. ‘

In Bolivia today, A A
deans are elected only with student approval. In-

 

 

university ‘ presidents and ,

deed, wrote S. Walter Washington in Foreign Af-
fairs. “In many places the students have the pro-
fessors and the administration completely cowed.”

Thus, one cites tradition and the independence
of the university student (and of the territorial
sovereignity of the university itself) as reasons for
the political inﬂuence of the Latin student class
while acknowledging that little analogy can be

drawn with the U.S. situation. However, one might -,»

wellask the question, will the political inﬂuence‘
of this class continue unabated? ‘
‘The. answer is dilﬁcult, but in view of the trem-
endous si‘gniﬁcance of the role of tradition in
Latin America, one is inclined to say that there
seems little chance that student influence will di-

diminish, but a considerable possibility that this in- ‘

ﬂuence may be “charineled.” A channeling might
well occur because of a general stabilizing of the
entire university situation, and because the Latin
students themselves realize the necessity for streng-
thening the academic standards of their schools.
As one example, Central University of Quito,
Ecuador, is improving its programs with the as-
sistance of the University of Pittsburgh. At Cor-
doba University, Argentina, rector'Jorge Orgaz re-
marked for Time magazine last week, “We have
less and less time ‘for politics. The. population_ is
burgeoning and the old careers are giving..way' to

. demands for training to deal with contemporary

and scientiﬁc “problems.”
Outsider Would Hail
An outsider would tend to hail this development,
for the stability of democratic governments” is to
be desired. However, it would be pretentious to
judge here whether the Latin student should or
should not have so much influence; whether he
should or should not be allowed to determine so
vigorously the actions of his government. But one
is not so reluctant in- voicing the opinion that the
‘political influence of the U.S. university’ student is_
too “channeled,” or, more accurately, too diverted.
Even with the. realization ofthe wide difference
between the Latin student ofthe U.S. student re-
specting-the cultural traditions with which they
live, one cannot help-buticonsider that a narrowing
of the political inﬂuence gap between the two
might indeed be in theiinterests of the students
‘themselves, ‘and perhaps in ..the interest of the
Hemispherealso. ' ' ‘

Michigan Sweeps NCAA Gymnastics

“It Goes On..."

 

TRIPLE PLAYS

Baseball Coach Bobby Lewis was telling a story the other
night at a get—together before the NCAA Gymnastics Cham-
pionships about the weirdest triple-killing since Bill VVamb-
sganss’ unassisted feat in the 1920 World Series. _

Here was the situation: The Panther baseball team was
out on the ﬁeld for only the second day and the ground was
still a bit damp. John Ciofﬁ had singled and was on ﬁrst base
when Al Ricutti lashed an extra-base hit into the outﬁeld.

“The throw is coming in from the outﬁeld,” Lewis re-
called, “and I see Ciofﬁ starting to slide into third. I had
told them not to slide, but it’s just instinctive to hit the
dirt, I guess. _

“Well, Cioﬁ‘i hesitated midway through his slide and
jerked awkwardly.Then I see Ricuitti ﬂopping over in the

same fashion at second base. Meanwhile the toss from the '

outﬁeld is overthrown and my pitcher J ohn Carlisle extends
his body tryin-g to catch it over his head, and he falls down.
All three of them are wincing their eyes and I can just en-
vision a great season jumping out the window.”
Fortunately, Cioﬁi was the only one who actually sus-
tained an injury—'—a sprained ankle—and he’ll be ready to go
this Week.
More Good News" . . ‘ p l .
Just as Lewis concluded this“ yarn, he was approached
by athletic trainer Roger McGill, who leaned over Lewis’
shoulder for a few choice words. _
“Paul (Martha) turned his ankle this afternoon in
football practice,” ‘McGill reported. -Martha happens to
also be Lewis’ third baseman. _
Lewis merely wrenched his face with his hands and
began listening to some other choice items from other direc-
tions at the'dinner table; e.g., “What do you think about the
.back layout? . . .

5? * =!=

A parallel incident occurred the same ‘day on the var-
sity practice ﬁeld where the football team was in action.
Fullback John Telesky, a‘ refrigerator with legs, personally
stretched three teammates in a tackling drill.

In obvious mismatches, he knocked out Tom Black and
Marv Lippincott with some bull-like rushes and also side-
lined Tom Ferraca. It’s a good thing California’s Pat Brown
is not governor of this state or Telesky would be outlawed for

— his brutal KO’s.

“He just lowered the_boom on them,” reportedassistant
coach Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi. “They had their heads down
when they tried to tackle him, and you just don’t do that.”

Cecconi said Marshall Goldberg Jr. was also stretched in
the afternoon session by Bob Long. Can this all be part of a
Wide—open attack?

A * * *

With all these casualties sprawled on the athletic ﬁelds it
seems a shame that the man who is usually bent over them
in such bad incidents won’t be with them this football season.‘
Trainer Makes Exif

Roger McGill, a long-time trainer with Panther teams, is
going to assume a similar position with the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers. This should put another strain on the athletic depart-
ment’s budget since they’ll truthfully need about three men
to replace him.

McGill, a little guy who fools you with his size, had a
rediculous work schedule here that would have tied "up a
team of surgeons; He was on the road quite a bit and this is
one of the reasons he was prompted to make the move.

“Can you imagine what this would do to a normal
guy?” McGill would always jest. “It.would kill him.”

This‘ is not doubtful. The Pitt News, in fact, was trying
to encourage McGill to make a last-minute entry in the
Olympic all-around event in the NCAA gymnastics champ-
ionships held here this weekend. .

Championships at Fitzgerald

Paced by Gil Larose, who
won three individual titles,
including the Olympic all-

around, the Wolverines ran up a
total of 129, easily outdistancing
Southern Illinois, which was sec-
ond with 73.

Michigan won six of the nine
events. Larose, in addition to his
all-around title, won the long
horse and hoizontal bar events.
Arno Lascari, who dominated the
Big Ten Championships with La.-
rose, won the parallel bars title
and Gary Edwin scored an easy
victory in the trampoline. Mike
Henderson tied for ﬁrst in the
ﬂoor exercise with Tom Seward
of Penn State to give the W0?»-
verines their sixth title.

Better Individuals

Despite the display of depfh
and versatility shown by Michi-
gan, the three ﬁnest performances

of the evening were those of the f

three champions who were not
Wolverines. In the still rings Dale
Cooper successfully defended the
title he won last year at Alber-
querque, New Mexico, with a.
score of 9.775, beatin Jim Hooper
of Wisconsin who tie for Big Ten
honors.

Russ Mills, Yale’s lone entry,
gave a flawless exhibition on
the side horse both nights, and
easily shook off the challenge
of Arizona’s Steve Doty, with a
score of 9.775. His performance
in the ﬁnals Saturday night led
several of the judges to say that
it was “the ﬁnest exhibition
we’ve ever seen on the side
horse.”

The best individual effort for
the meet was reserved for the
last event of the evening, tumbl-
ing. Harold Holmes, the lone en-
try from Illinois, stunned the
crowd with a brilliant display of
ﬂips and twists as he dethroned
Southern Illinois’ Rusty Mitchell,

who was second. Holmes regis-_

tered an overall score of 9.825, the

highest individual score of the
meet. _
. In the Olympic all - around,

which was concluded Friday, Gil
Larose easily won as he showed
great versatility in the six Olym-
pic events (all except tumbling
and trampoline). Fred Orlofsky of
Southern Illinois was second for
the third straight year, just like
his team.

Jack Lehner was the only Pan-
ther to qualify for the ﬁnals. He
qualiﬁed ﬁrst in the long horse
in the preliminaries, but a poor

handspring vault in his ﬁrst at-

tempt in the ﬁnals ruined his
chance for victory. He eventually
placed in a tie for fourth.

 

BEN JINKS gained honorable
mention on The Palestra Al1-Op-
ponent basketball team. He was
the only Temple foe to be named.
He scored 25 points against the

Rankin To Head PM

Ignatius‘ F. Rankin, dean of Oakland ‘plumbers, has been
contracted by the University to install a new head in the Stu-

Parking Petitions
Mean Record Club
Memberships  

All of the 2,000 students and
faculty members who signed The
News Pitt anti-parking meters
campaign, have, in reality, only
signed "membership applications
for the Columbia Record Club,
campaign chairman Matt Swe-
tonic. announced today.

According to Swetonic, he will
receive one free album for each
signature he collected.

“It’s the greatest fraud ever
pulled on campus,” Swetonic
yelled through the keyhole of his
barred oiﬁce. “All those poor kids
thought they were protesting me-
ters, and they were realy join-
ing the record club.”

Swetonic added, however, that
students may listen to the 2,000
albums from the hallway if they
shout requests through —the "key-
hole.

 

Gseat necessitated immediate ac-

tion.

“The seating arrangements in

-the washroom,” commented
Landy, “will have to be improved
before we can move with great
vigor. I expect to ﬁnd everything
ready for me when I return "to
school in September.”
V Olofson, who will be leaving, for
Switzerland in a few weeks to
check up on some ﬁnancial in-
vestments he has there, calls
Landy’s move “a great step for-
ward in a positive direction.”

Living Color

Rankin, an ardent supporter of
SQ’s stand on the parking pro-
posal, stated that he plans to add
color as well as a new seat to
the present facilities.

“I think a bright shade of
chicken yellow would do very
nicely for the washroom,” com-
mented the bleary eyed plum-
ber.

Rankin also plans to install one
of his trademarks above the new
toilet, a sign reading: “Occupancy

TProfessor Fears Standards

To Dip as Salaries Go Down

By WESBOOK PEGLOG ’

Tuition dropped last week to two dollars a credit, accord-
ing to aespokesman for the Comptrol1er’s olﬁce.

Reaction from the student body and the faculty was im-
mediate as soon as word leaked out Friday afternoon.

A respected University professor, who asked that his

name be not used pending discussion by the Faculty Senate,
voiced strong disapproval of the‘ A

tuition drop.
Lower Standards

“I am very afraid that this
move will lower academic stan-
dards at this University,” he said.
“If tuition-is cut, then the salary
paid to instructors of all ranks
must of necessity be lowered.
And, when this occurs, the qual-
ity of individuals who wish to
teach for those lower salaries will
also fall.”

Long lines of studehts formed
at the Oﬂice of Student Records
last week when the drop was
made known. Comments from
students in the lines ranged
from “I’ve waited for this ever
since I came here” to cries of “I
just can’t believe it.” '

The consensus of opinions ex-
pressed seemed‘ to be that, be-
cause of the new low_ rates, stu-
dents would now be attending
more classes.

‘A slight alteration will be
/made in the Activities Fee.
the Office‘ of the Comptroller
has announced. It will be
raised from $72 to $599.

Greek Week
Floats May

Be, Spirited

Socrates Schwartz has recently
been named chairman ‘of this
year’s Greek Week. The month
long celebration will begin with
the annual carrying of the flame
of knowledge from the Luna on
the corner of Center and Craig to
Frankie Gustine’s on Forbes
Street. ' '

As you all remember, last year
Euripides Scheisskopf was run
down by a ﬂoat depicting the
Second World War just as he
turned onto Fifth Avenue and
the ﬂame of knowledge rolled
into a celery patch. The result-
ing holocaust seriously endan-
gered the Mellon Institute until
a group of brothers smothered the
ﬂames with their dates.

“This year,” commented
Schwartz, “we are not going to
take any chances. This year the
ﬂame carrier will ride on a ﬂoat
depicting a Roman sailing ship
with pledges serving as galley
slaves. We are going to have him
hold the torch over, a keg of
Schlitz so if he should stumble.
the ﬂame will be doused.

“The only trouble we envision,”

By More Than One Person For-

bidden by the SG, Constitution."

sighed the troubled chairman, “is

trying to keep the darn keg full.”

 lcthyology Major

  

Has Done othing  

By W. R. HEARST

Marvin_ K. Zelkabit, who will
complete his undergraduate work
next month, is the most unusual
student on campus.

—He belongs to no organization,
has never received a loan, schol-
arship, fellowship or other grant,
has never been to Europe, has no
unusual occupation or hobby and
has never had his name mention-
ed in passing conversation, much
less The News Pitt.

“It was easy,” Zelkabit told a
News Pitt reporter. “I just went
to class, studied, and tried to be
a~good student.” , .

Zelkabit has completed four
amazing years of not being a
member of the Student Union
Board, Student Publications, Stu-
dent Government, Men’s Council,
any honorary or social fraternity,
club or athletic team. His record
is un_parallelled in University his-
tory. ’

- Feels His Feat

The senior icthyology major
feels his feat is nothing to be
praised. “Anybody ‘can really do
it if they apply themselves,” he
reported.

“One of my best accomplish-
ments was not receiving a Sen-
atorial scholarship,” he com-
mented shyly. “The vote-hun-
gry politicians tried to pawn
one off on me but I fought back
and won." / ’

Ze1kabit's only fear is that he
will receive an award for com-
/plete non-activity during his four

years here. “That would mean it
would go under my name in the
Owl and that would ruin my per-
fect blank record.”

 

University’s Top
Jain-Lai Players
Now On Probation

Three of the University’s top-

jai-lai players were placed on
probation last week as a result
of a skirmish with the Pittsburgh
Police.

Ronald ‘Gringo, a Cuban ex-
change prisoner, who plays on
the ﬁrst—string team, told The
News Pitt that the ﬁght was
purely an accident. ,

“I wouldn’t exactly call it a
beer - brawl,” the pink - cheeked
athlete said, “but we were kind
of zonked out that night. Any-
way, this bartender asked me for
my identiﬁcation card and _I
called him a meanie and—well,
he got 14 busted-up ribs and a
crinkly clavicle.” .
.Gringo, and his companions
Gregorio Garcia and Pancho Bibo,
were jailed on charges of con-
duct unbecoming of a Naval
Commander.

Asked whether the probation
will extend through, the Jai-lai
season, athletic director Frank
Craver said, “Who cares- we
don’t have a 'jai-lai team here
anyway."

HOW TO GET EDUCATED.
ALTHOUGH ATTENDING COLLEGE

sense of the word? «

’l‘his question is being tlSl(O(l today by many serious observer!
—-including my bnr_ber, m_v roofer, and my little dog Spot--

and it would be well to seek an answer.

Are we becoming experts only in the conﬁned area of our
majors, or does our knowledge range far and wide? Do we, for
example, know who fought in the B:it.tle of Jenkins’ Ear, or
Kant’s epistemology, or Planck's constant, or Vulsalva’s maneu-
ver, or what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern
Abbey?

If‘we do not, we are turning, alz-is, into specialists. How
then can we broaden our vistas, lengthen our hor'izons—-be-

come, in short, educated?

Well sir, theﬁrst thing we must do is throw away our curri-
cula. Tomorrow, instead of going to the same old classes, let
us try something new. Let us not think of college as a rigid
discipline, but as it kind of vast zicmleiiiic smoi'gashord, with
all kinds of tempting intellectual tidbits to savor. Let’s start

sampling tomorrow.

lie was in zmvax be

We will begin the day with a stimulating seminar in Hittite
artifa.cts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the sea slugs. Then we will open our pores by
drilling a. spell with the ‘ROTC. Then we'll go over to journalism
and tear out the front page. Then we'll go to the medical school
and autograpli some casts. Then we’ll go to home economics

   

   

' . '.

to e L4

  

and have lunch. '

And between classes we’ll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added ﬁllip to the broadening of
- our education. This is an essenlial. To learn to live fully and
well is an important part of education, and Marlboros are an
important part of living fully and well. What a sense of com-
leteness you will ‘get from Marlboro's ﬁne tobaccos, from
arlboro’s pure ﬁlter! What ﬂavor Marlboro delivers! Through
that immaculate ﬁlter comes flavor in full measure, flavor with-
out stint or compromise, ﬂavor that wrinkled care derides, _
ﬂavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist’s
art comes to you in soft pack or Flip-Top box and can be lighted
with match, "lighter, candle, Welsbach mantle, or by rubbing

two small Indians together.

When we have embarked on this new regiinen—-or, more
accurately, luck of regimen——we will soon be cultured as all
get out. When strangers accost us on the street and say, “What
was Wordsworth doing ten miles above '.l‘intern~Abbey, hey?’3
we will no longer slink away in silent abzisliment. We will reply .

loud and clear:

“As any truly educated person knows, Wordswortli, Shelley,
and Keats used to go to the Widdicombe Fair every year for
the poetry-writ-ing contests and th1‘ee—legged races, both of
which they enjoyed lyricallv. Well sir, imagine their chagrin
when they arrived at the Fair in_'l776 and learned that Oliver
(Jroinwcll, uneasy because Guy Fawkes had just invented the
spinning jenny, had cancelled all public
the Widdicombe Fair and Liverpool.
that he drowned himself in a butt of malmsey. Keats went to
London and bccariie Charlotte Bronte. Wordsworth ran blindly

~ into the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above
Tintern Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and
kicking his little fat legs. At length, peace returned to him. He
looked around, noted the beauty of the forest, and was so moved
that he wrote Joyce Kiliner’s immort.al Trees. . . And that,
smart-apple, is wliat Wordswoith was doing ten miles above

Tin tern Abhey.’?

Poets and peasants, students and teachers, ladies and gentle- .
men—-all know you get a lot to like in a Mn.rlb‘oro-available -

“The Spanish Inquisition”

Will be the theme for this

year’s ‘Homecoming celebration it was announced today by
Torquemada Smith-Finster, chairman of the weekend event.
_ “The fraternities and sororities _are already hard at work,”
chuckled Smith-Finster, “and we hope to provide some lively
entertainment for the returning alum. A

“Each of the floats will depict°
an event in the life of Don Carlos
Schroeder, headsman of Seville,
and during halftime the Chancel-
lor will lead members of the ad-

One Maiden — Piping Hot

Bruno Scholengowski, captain

ed to supply a scantily dressed

team: ‘for sacriﬁce to Trustees
Moola, patron god of the Uni-
versity.

Kappa Allah Rah, who’s
pledge program is rated “most
likely to cause cirrhosis of the
liver” has announced its inten- ,
tion to supply the rest "of the
fraternities with thumb screws
at half price.

. Alvin Himmler, president of
the Pittsburgh chapter, smirked
“it’s up to the fraternities to sup-
port Homecoming, and what’s an
inquisition without thumb screws?
'Besides, the house could use a
new‘ ice cube maker _—' the old
one only turns out 750 an hour.”

As in past years, the homecom-
ing queen will be announced at
the dance‘ Saturday evening in
the Commons Room. “This year,

.-‘.however,” commented Smith-Fin-
'ster, “in honor of our theme the
winner will be called The Iron

Less Practice, More Weiglit

By ART SILVERMAN
Wrestling coach Rex Peery, the hardest loser in the ath-
letic department, has_announced two startling revisions in

“Next year we’re only going

of his worst season since 1951.

to practice twice a week for

‘one hour. This way the boys won’t¢

be tired during the matches.”

1 Peery’s other innovation is even
more startling. “I’m gonna try
and get some meat on the bones

too thin. I want some fat wrestlers
next year,” Peery said. ,

“The way it looks now,” the
coach continued, “I think I'll
have Mike Johnson up to 157-
pounds for our season opener in
January and by the time the
tournaments roll around in
March, I ﬁgure he’ll be able
to go at 167-pound. I’ll also
have Tom Heniﬁ at 147-pounds
and John Carr at heavyweight.”

These " wide sweeping changes
instituted by Peery are an answer
Athletic Director Frank Carver’s
ultimatum of a few weeks ago
“to have wide-open winning
wrestling or else.”

To help Peery install this new
type of wrestling Carver has nam-
ed Art Silverman as assistant
coach.
