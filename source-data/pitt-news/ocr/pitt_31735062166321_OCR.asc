  Streamlined Inoculation

Program Reaches 96%

Over 13,000 students and staff at the University of Pitts-
burgh have received the ﬁrst inoculation against poliomyelitis.
Approximately 96 per cent of the undergraduate stu-
dents have been inoculated in the recent free program spon-

sored by the University.

According to a poll taken by students on Monday, most

of those who have not been inoc--o—~--»

ulated in the program received
'-{the vaccinations earlier from their
{family doctors. »

' 1* Two weeks ago practice inoc-

ulations were made at the
School of Public Health and the
Dental School. At the former,
450 students and staff were vac-
cinated and at the Dental school
200 received the vaccine. At
Johnstown Center teams inoc-
ulated 550 students on Monday.

Figures for the remainder of the
graduate schools, students, em-
ployees, and faculty, are present-
ly incomplete.

‘ Similar. procedure as was fol-
lowed for these inoculations will
be used in the administration
of the second shots scheduled
for the end of March.

The program was handled by
volunteer service of 660 faculty,
staff and students of the Univers-
ity. Physicians and nurses worked
entirely without payment.

There was very little waiting
involved in the program. on the
part of those who received the
shots. . ,

on Bouquet Street and contains a
brick mercantile building on Fifth

SC Hears Consolidation Plans

Evaluating Group 
Offers Reform Plan

By MILLARD ANIDUR
The committee for evaluating student government re-
ported to Student Congress on a proposed-basis for student

government at Pitt Monday

committee was established in November by Congress to’

study and evaluate student

in the Student Union. , This

governmenton campus, com-

pare other programs, and propose any changes in structure

necessary to strengthen it. O-~—
Faculty, alumni, and student in— teemeﬂ The)’ attempted to give
terests are represented on the a voice to all students without

evaluating group. ‘Irv Rothman
was chairman of the evaluators
until hisigraduation in January,
when Bob Lancaster,.Col. ’57, took
over the important post. Several
new members will be appointed
shortly to insure continuity, since

the ﬁnal plan may not be com-‘

plete until next fall.

Study Conducted

The committee pooled informa-
tion obtained from other schools

on governmental structures. They :

found most valuable a report is-
sued by UCLA which included
representation and structures of
28 colleges and universities
throughout the country.

Members ﬁrst came to several
general conclusions. There is no
one plan implemented more than
any other; each school must suit
its individual needs. Responsible
membership is the prime asset a
functional government must have
and it is often useful to include
representatives of inﬂuential
groups. Average memberships for
the bodies which were studied are
24.

_ Representation was the ﬁrst
problem tackled by the commit-

any avoidable duplication. It
was felt that members who had
an obligation to a specific area
of student interest would prove
effective.

The name of the new govern-
mental structure, designed to en-
‘compass the whole university and
limit the importance of any all-
male or fem a l e governmental
group, will be the “University of
Pittsburgh Student Government
Association.”
Each of the schools, living units
( r e s i d e n ts, non-residents, and
|Greeks) and activity areas (Men’s
and Women’s Council), will have
its president as a representative
in UPSGA.

The Oaken

By Barbara Cheringion

Joe wanted to know what’s behind the oak
door. I

It was one day last week when he wandered
up the first ﬂoor leading to the Forbes Street side
of the Cathedral. » He’d come to that huge wooden
door on the left when he saw another student
pull the door open and disappear to the other side.

The next thing he knew, Joe

liant chandelier. Rows and rows
of people faced the front of the
room. Joe ﬁgured that"he’cl un-
fortunately entered into one of
those factory-type classrooms.
He wanted to leave, but, feel-
ing the daggers that people star-
ed at him for interrupting the
speaker, he sat down in the back
of the room.

, Sfuffy Lecture?

He heard words coming from the lecture lead-
er, but he didn’t, listen carefully because he be-
lieved that he’d-gotten himself, unwittingly, into
an hour of a professor’s impersonal stuffy lec-
ture. He knew those in the front row would carry
the discussion if there was any. “And then he did
what he was used to in many of his classes—-
settle comfortably for forty winks.

Just as he folded his arms, leaned his head
back on the wall, and prepared to doze, Joe be-
came aware of the person at the front table. The
sight of that person forced his dropping eyes to
open. The person was a pretty red-haired girl
wearing a navy blue jumper and a white blouse.

Bookends And Lamps 2

 

 

Door

Oops, Joe thought, I must be xin some kind’.
of committee meeting. But what’s that she’s say-
ing‘?

Circus Queen

Not until then did Joe actually hear her words,
for his ears had been trained to close once he
nabbed a back seat in a class room. Now he heard

the girl tell an odd rhythmical story about a cir- Q

cus queen, a strong, vivacious woman who re-
signed herself in age to being a charwoman.“

The girl sat down. No one spoke. It seemed
that everyone was left with the feeling of age
by those last words. Joe was confused. But he
knew that whatever the meeting was, he was not
going to fall asleep.

A sharp-looking young man rose to the lec-
ture, called four names and sat down. Four men

~ who Joe recognized to be on the football team

strutted to the lecturn. Now Joe was completely‘
confused. He had thought this meeting might“ be’
that Poetry Festival he read about, but now . . .
football players? . 

They said, simply, g,‘Freedom, by Thomas Paine}? n

Then the four deep bases boomed through the
room in unison and later singly. Joe had been
assigned to read that work of Paine in his Ameri-
can literature class, but he had thought it dry up

. to now.

After the foursome, several other students read.
Joe was convinced that this couldn’t be the Poetry
Reading Festival.

., Whatever it is though, he thought, I’d rather
take part in this than in some of my classes. May-_
be they’ll have meetings like this soon again. ‘"

 (ampaign Medals

As the ﬁnal ﬁgufies come in, it is apparent that a very
geffective assault has been made on poliomyelitis at the Uni-

Creative Driftwood I 

versity.
' Percentages close to 100 have been reported from most

’ areas of the mass inoculation. Almost all of the full-time
"undergraduate and graduate students have received their

shots in the Pitt sponsored free vaccination plan.

At the outset the program ‘was designed to set an ex-
ample for institutions across the nation. It was planned
to show /to the most skeptical that mass inoculations of
the :vaccine can be carried out, effectively and eﬁiciently,

by volunteer help and of no charge to individuals.

The success of the attack made here at Pitt will have
national and even international repercussions. It_1s pos-
sible that the objectives of Dr. Jonas Salktand his asso-
ciates will be accomplished and that crippling polio may,

y»

‘be all but wiped out this year. i

After. any successful campaign there are medals to be
awarded. The medals in this assault are represented by
thesatisfaction of knowing that many have been saved
from a life of illness and possibly from death.

To Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men, and to Dr. Harry
Bisel, who acted as chairmen of the campaign a great vote
of thanks and appreciation for a job well done is in order.

‘ Dr./Bisel shared in the work of planning the enormous '

campaign and worked during the actual program giving
inoculations. Mr. Biddle worked on the planning and admin-
istration of the program. He was also observed many even-
ings during the hectic weeks before the inoculation days
working with students in the distribution of appointment
cards and at the information center in the Commons Room.

Also to Richard Cunningham,’as istant dean of men,
and his staff of student volunteers an to Irv Rothman, for
his weekly reports, goes many thanks. A '

To the wives and husbands of faculty personnel who
volunteered their services to help complete the work of
administering the program along with all those in the em-

ployment of the University who worked overtime without

pay for the success of the
sented.

To all those including nurses and physicians, who work-
ed free of charge in the actual inoculating of the over 13,000, .
acheartfelt ovation will come from those unknown persons
who might have been victims of the disease.

The battle is by no means over here at Pitt but a de-
cisive blow has been struck and an example set for others
to follow. If the following inoculations are as successful,

plan a medal of honor is pre-

~ it will be the greatest step forward for the University since

the discovery of the vaccine.

While in Jacksonville‘, Florida,
for the Gator Bowl game last
December a number of Pitt News
reporters interviewed a Mrs.
Victoria Broadbent,
engaged in a
type of handi-
craft that is
found no where

This kind, elderly woman has
a style unmatched anywhere in
the nation. With an ordinary
piece of driftwood cast upon the
Florida shore this remarkable
woman has fashioned beautiful,
animals in the form of bookends,
paperweights, nicknacks, wall

brush she has painted each ob-

a different lustre. Many of the

By Millard Amdur -

This past week, a’ thoroughly
entertaining character visited

Pittsburgh and the University.

He is John Godley, Lord Kil-
bracken of Killegar. His witty
barb and candid British manner-
isms endeared Kilbracken to
many who heard him at the well-
attended Men’s Debate Associa-
tion meeting of Thursday, Feb.
28. An even larger audience saw
and heard Kilbracken on the
MDA television show “Face the
People,” the night before.

Kilbracken spoke of the Ox-
ford Union, a debating society
quite unlike any in the United‘
States. Anyone attending Oxford
may belong to the Union and
debate topics which Kilbracken
stated are usually of general in-
terest, but sometimes are rather
absurd. \
Purpose of Debate

The purpose of the debate at

.the.Union, aside from the obvious

educational one, is to sway the
audience to your side. If any in
the audience concur w_ith the
ideas expressed by one side‘ in
an argument, they move to that

speaker’s half of the; gallery.

until she is satisfied.
Published Book .'

Mrs. Broadbent has just pub-

ylished a very different type of

book entitled Vicki’s Drift—wood
Animal Kingdom. This book is
dedicated to her husband, the
late John Howard Broadbent.
Annapolis, ’25. The primary
reason that this book is unusual
is because it is not printed or
lithographed as most books are.
but rather written in long hand
by the author and her hand-
writing reproduced by the pub-
lisher. In her book she tells stor-
ies and short anecdotes about her
different creations. From read-
ing this potpourri of driftwood
modeling the reader learns that
Mrs. Broadbent’s creations have
been exhibited and widely used
as lecture material. They are
also veterans of radio and tele-
vision. Her distinguished family
has 250 members of which 100
have a place of nobility.

Mrs. Broadbent has sent sam-
ples of her work to the Queen

His “Lordship John Godley . . .

Well Mannered Wit

Questions may be directed at the
speakers by members of the aud-
ience as the debate progresses

which they may or may not an-

swer.

The general quality of the de-
bates and cross discussion at the
Union is not as high as it should
be, according to the peer, but the
summations at the end of four
or five hours of wrangling are,
for the most part. well done. .

Kilbracken dwelt on the House
of Commons and House of Lords
during the latter half of his ad-
dress. The discussion at Com-
mons, he believes, is of very
poor quality. To be recognized,
one must “catch the eye” of the
speaker of the House, a rather
undemocratic system. In the
House of Lords, ‘the level of dis-
cussion is somewhat higher and
the peers’ prerogativeto speak
is protected. V

One of the reasons for this is
that a quorum in the House of
Lords is but 3 and an average
attendance is between 20 and 40
of the 900 peers who are mem-
bers of the august group. How-
ever, when an important matter
is discussed, 300-400 may come

ates a crowded condition in

Kilbracken shuddered to think
what might happenshould‘ all of
the Lords gather at once. Half,
he said, would be standing or
sitting on the ﬂoor near the ros-
trum. The Lord stated that he‘
had attended only two sessions
of the House of Lords, once when
he was seated, and the second
time to see how in the world the
British could justify their posi-
tion in the Suez.

Most peers today cannot af-
ford the luxury of attending the
sessions. Unless a peer has an
assured personal income, as few
do, or are potential political can-
didates, they donot attend. Ask-
ed concerning the political power
of the House of Lords, Kilbrack-
en replied they could theoretical-
ly block passage of legislation
through Commons for a year’s
time, but rarely take advantage
of this privilege.

Kilbracken is currently con-
ducting a lecture tour of the
U. S. He has written proliﬁcally
for the New Yorker and other
American magazines.

Mermen Try For Sixth

Consecutive EC SA Title

By MURRAY CHASS ,
So near, but yet so far sums up the Panther mermen’s
chances for retiring their second consecutive James H. Reilly
Trophy at New York University this weekend in the Eastern

‘Collegiate Swimming Association championships.

The local natators took home their ﬁrst permanent Reilly
trophy in 1954, and now need only one more crownto be
given their second. But the out-
look for that necessary crown is
not a pleasant one. ‘

Coach Ben Grady whose 1956
squad‘ scored the most points
in ECSA championship history,
feels that the lack of depth on

this season’s team will prove to
be the unseating of his’ half-
decade reign. A V  _________ 

“We can take some ﬁgst places, , W ite Fischer
but the way the meet is scored the winning team must take more
than some ﬁrsts.” In the ECSA points are awarded for ﬁrst through
sixth place in 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 fashion.

Last year the Panthers tallied a total of 139 points while runner-
up Lehigh garnered 71. Out of 13 events the locals captured ten ﬁrsts
and received points for 19 other places.

But only six swimmers are back from the ﬁfth winning squad
with breaststroker Ed Robson the lone defending titleholder.

, On the bright side, Coach Grady has his captain, Warne White,
for a pair of possible titles in the 220- and 440—yard freestyles. White
ﬁnislrfed behind Zurcher last year. and Grady thinks that the senior
should be able to bring home a couple of wins.

Robson is expected to repeat in the 200—yard breaststroke
and then add another championship in the new l00—yard breast.

The other strong event for the Panthers will be the diving. Burt
Marks, who took a second and a sixth last year, and Milo Fischer,
who placed fourth and ﬁfth, will both compete in the low and high
board events. _

If season meet times mean anything, the Panther relay teams
should be upended in their bids to repeat. Concerning these times,
Grady comments, “Lehigh’s relay teams are faster on paper, but
anything can happen in a championship meet.”

_ The veteran Grady also concedes that‘Lehigh is the strong-

, est team‘.i'_5n the title swim, but he adds that this strength is “on

C‘ paper.” ...ffWith the depth in personnel that they have, Lehigh
should win',’.’ he says. “I believe that we will battle it out for
second with Rutgers.”

Flying Rings, Tumbling

Strongholds OfAerohats

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The Panther gymnastics team travels to Syracuse this
weekend to_ participate in the 30th annual Eastern Inter-
collegiate Gymnastics championships. Coach Warren Neiger’s
talented acrobats are looking for their best showing yet on
the basis of their successful regular season record of six
Wins and three losses. The event is designed to reward in-
 ’ 1 lg "dividual performers and no team

champion is selected.

Panther hopes are high in the
ﬂying rings event as Coach
Neiger optimistically states, “I
believe Tom Darling, Jack Ham-
mond, and Dave Hirst have ex-
cellent chances to score.’

Darling, w h o s e performance
against Penn State was the high-
light of last week’s meet, took

 

    

Hammond Ruber

 second in last year’s rings ﬁnal at the Easterns and must be counted
on as this years favorite to win. Hammond and Hirst are steady ‘

performers, also, and shouldn’t be too far behind.

Tumbling may be another event where the Blue and Gold can
pick up some honors. Once again Hammond and Hirst are the boys
who can do the job on the long mat. Sophomore tumbler, Don Neeld,
is conceded an outside chance by Neiger who says, “Don can be an
excellent competitor when he’s ‘right’.”

Once upon a time, when the
world was really evil, and a
thief lurked behind every bush,
cautious men had their shirts
g painted on! The reason for this
is explained by. a perceptive
saying of those days: -

“Forsooth, nothing deters
those rapscallions about town.

They’ll steal anything that
isn't buttoned down.”

Rough days — particularly
for the shirt business, what
with painters picking up all
the proﬁts. Until, suddenly,
an idea of genius appeared.
The button-down shirt! This
shirt was actually buttoned on
to the chest of the wearer, making
it absolutely steal—proof!

Today, in these honest times,
we still feel its inﬂuence. It is

 

the true ancestor of that glori-
ous style-——the shirt with the

- button down collar! Isn’t his-

tory interesting?

Van Heusen~—~because they
know so much about the but-
ton-down — has done more
with it than anybody else.
Take our new line called the
Van Ivy, for instance. Here
are button-downs in tartan
checks and stripes. .Van Ivys
look marvelous with suits and
sport coats, and worn open at
the neck give you a roguish
look. They also have a button
on the back of the collar, for

Tourney Success
Depends On Drive .

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports liditor

Pitt’s surprising, but not unexpected, selection for the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament leaves
but one question roaming the minds of Panther partisans-
How far can the Blue and Gold cagers advance in the tour-
nament which recognizes the winner’ as the No. 1 team in

the nation.

Coach Bob Timmons’ ﬂoormen face Morehead State (Ky.) in
their opening Midwest regional on March 12. If they get past More-
head they will be meeting the Kentucky Wildcats in a second round
game. This could very well be where they meet their Waterloo
unlss they play the kind of game their coach has taught them to
play.

The most antagonizing fault of the Blue and Gold offense
is their reluctance to drive through the middle for layup shots.
Failure to exercise the “offensive edge” for rough, driving bas-
ketball has forced the Panthers to revert to outside shooting.
In more than one instance this year their poor outside ﬁring en-
tirely changed the complexion of a game. “

In the West Virginia tilt at Morgantown which the Mounties
won, 107-93, one didn’t need two hands to count the number of
times the locals drove through the key for layup shots in the‘ first
half. The Panthers would just not drive. The Mountaineers set their
defense to guard against the long shot. They did not have to worry
about the close ones because even the locals’ big men were ﬁring
from outside the charity circle.

These repeated misses rattled the offense. The big men were
not rebounding under the offensive board because they were out of
position. This enabled the Ridgerunners to pull out in front by 15
points within ten minutes of the ﬁrst half.

The approaching NCAA tourney will determine if they have
shaken this hardwood evil. It’s a necessity if they want to
play more than one or two games; especially if they run up

A against Adolph Rupp’s Wildcats. This is one ‘quintet that you
rarely beat on outside shooting alone. Rupp’s style of play is
mostly offense, but he has the rebounding strength necessary
to quickly change a game into a rout.

Let’s hope, then, that the Blue and Gold shows some drive in
the NCAA classic. They came through a rugged schedule with a
15-9. record against some of the toughest competition in the nation.
This was probably the most inﬂuential reason for their selection. It’s
up to them to drive for Pitt, and uphold the Pitt tradition of great
performances in post-season classics.

“I wanted a career that ollered
variety, opportunity and a chance to
work with people,” says Lewis William
Post, . C.E., Michigan State, 1950.
“That’s. why I went to work for the
telephone company.

“My initial training—two full years
of it—probed every phase of company
operations and acquainted me with all
of the ‘jobs in the Plant Department,
where I was starting.

“Today, as Plant Engineer, I’m re-
sponsible for preventive maintenance
of all ﬁeld equipment, installation of
new facilities for wire and cable, and
I work with architects and builders
on telephone needs in new buildings.

“Selling’s part of my job, too. I
sell ideas—like the wisdom of plan-
ning for telephone service, when you’re
building. Recently I advised an archi-
tect and an owner on telephone wiring
and outlets in a new $160,000 medi-
cal center. I enjoy getting in on the
ground ﬂoor of such projects and
making contributions both as a‘ civil
and a telephone engineer.

“In my area of Chicago there are
80,000 telephones, home and busi-
ness. ‘More are being ‘added every
day. There’s expansion everywhere
in the telephone business-all across
the country. To me, the future looks

Q

 

“I was tremendously impressed,’ ’ says
Nick, “by my ﬁrst plant tour. When
you go through the facilities-meet
the men and get an idea of the prob-
lems they handle-you can’t help but
become interested. Add the friendly,
informal work atmosphere, and you
know right off the bat these people
have a story to tell."

Nick came to IBM in 1951 with a
B.S. in physics. He started as a Tech-
nical Engineer—in Test Equipment
Engineering-working on an analog
bombing system. When that project
moved from the Endicott to the
Poughkeepsie plant, Nick followed it,
becoming first an Associate Engineer,
then a Project Engineer. As the lat-

 

Hcuding up Quality Engineering

ter, he worked on IBM’s first transis-
-torized electronic computer—the 608.

By November, '55, Nick was head-
ing up Quality Engineering in the
Quality Control Division of the
Poughkeepsie plant. Recently pro-
moted to Administrative Assistant to
the Quality Control manager, Nick
now concerns himself with the funda-
mental operations and policies of this
460-man division. Quality Control is
responsible for the performance of
IBM's vast array of business ma-
chines-from simple sorters and
punches to the “electronic brains."

What an IBM physicist does

“The problems of Quality Control
in this business are endless,” ‘Nick
reports, “and fascinating to the phys-
icist. Thei-e’s process control—of the
manufacture of components such as

“What’s it like to be
A PHYSICIST AT IBNI?"i

/

Five years ago, college senior Nick Hemmer asked himself this question..
Today, as Administrative Assistant to the Quality Control manager, Nick
reviews his experience at IBM and gives some pointers that may be helpful
to you in taking the first, most important step in your career as a physicist.

tion of alloys . . . or of the properties
of metals, such as the resistivity of
germanium. Then, there are the im-
portant ‘analysis of failure’ and
~re1iability studies, in which you seek
to determine, for example, the ‘life

expectancy’ of a device, the mean
time between failures, or perhaps
which step in a process has the great-
est effect on the equipment involved.
You may be asked to control the
deposit of glass on X-ray tubes to
avoid spill-over, or microscopic spot-
ting. Or you may be dealing with
arc-suppression, or gaseous electron-
ics, the grass roots of instrumentation ;
or in the estimation of tolerances, or

in correlation coefficients-that is,
in physically sound numbers."

Nick has been instrumental iii
encouraging many college" physics
majors to come to IBM. “I ﬁnd‘
they're interested in questions like
these," he says: “How would you go
about determining the ‘life’ of elec-
trons in transition from the valence
to the conduction band?” Or, in the
manufacture of magnetic inks, “How
can the grain size of the iron content

tration and concentricity of colloidal
solutions?” “Present a job in terms
of actual problems,” believes Nick,
“and you’ll get the man's interest—-

for it's his career and his future that I

have top priority.”
How about further study?

Nick has taken full advantage of
IBM's extensive educational facilities
_to get ahead at IBM. He took at least
one course each semester on subjects
within his immediate work area-—.
courses on digital and analog com-
puters and on their components such
as cores and transistors. He found
time to take management courses as
well. “If you want opportunity for
study," Nick says, “IBM will provide
all you want.” _ .

 
   

Promotion almost inoviiublo

Asked about opportunities for ad-
vancement at IBM, Nick says, “The
situation could hardly be better in
that respect. With sales doubling
every ﬁve years on the average, pro-

, motion is almost inevitable."

IBM hopes that this message will help to
give you some idea of what it's like to be
a physicist at IBM. There are equal op-
portunities for E.E.’s, M.E..'s, mathema-
ticians and Liberal Arts majors in IBM's
many divisions——Research, Manufactur-
ing Engineering, Sales and Technical
Services. Why not drop in and discuss
IBM with your Placement Director? He
can supply our latest brochure and tell
you when IBM will nextinterview on
your campus. Meanwhile, our Manager
of Engineering Recruitment, Mr. R. A.‘
Whitehorne, will be happy to answer your
questions. Just write him at IBM, Room
