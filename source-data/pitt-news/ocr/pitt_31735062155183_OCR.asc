Panel Reviews Housing Proposals

Blood Donor Group
Formed for Faculty

The University Senate has formed a Donor Cl.ub in
co-operation .'with the Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh
for the protection of faculty members and their families.
To become affective January 1, it may be expanded to
include staff members and students ’

As it now stands the Donor Club should cover 6,600
individuals- This ﬁgure i's based on the fact that there are
approximately 1,100 faculty members and the assumption
that each faculty member represents six individuals, in-

Are you afraid of yourselves ?, challenged Phyllis Campbell at a panel discussion
concerning off-campus housing for women students over 21 and the elimination of cur-
fews for senior women. A panel of six women students, moderated by Helen P. Rush,
dean of women, discussed the proposals before a group of approximately 75 dormitory
students, Wednesday night. . _

Before the discussion began Dean Rush explained: “It Wﬂl not be my decision
alone. The answer will be given, not to keep peace, not to compromise with a minority,
and not to yield to a majority-” She raised the following questions concerning the pro-

osals:
D ——What policy decisions can wisely be left to students who are here for a short
period? t
—Are there limits of personal freedom that come from corporate living?
—To what extent is individual freedom limited outside the University?

cluding children, parents and parents-in-law

Donor credits are established in
the Club account exactly like a
checking account by the deposit
of a unit of blood in the Central
Blood Bank. This reserve of blood
credits will assure every family
member of blood replacement
coverage in any hospital in the
United States. Every faculty mem-
ber’s family will be covered whe-
ther or not there is an eligible
donor in the immediate family.

The need for such a Donor
Club was seen to exist when the
University Senate’s Committee on
Health and Welfare discovered
that the group would use approx-

imately 200 units of blood annu-

ally, based on national statistics.
Thomas Checkley, professor of
law, is committee chairman.

“If the student body is inter-
ested in joining the Donor Club,
students ‘ should petition an ad-
ministrative spokesman to bring
it before the Senate Committee,”
explained Leland Deck, director
of University personnel.

All full-time students, graduate
and undergraduate, as well as
their spouses or parents would

be included in such a club.

Air Cadets
Get Awards

Three University Air Force
ROTC (AFROTC) students have
been designated as Distinguished
Cadets. They are: Cadets Luke
L. Gill, group commander; Wil-
liam A. Lengyel, deputy group
commander, and Harold C. Helt,
Jr. Each will be offered a com-
mission in the Regular Air Force
upon graduation.

Distinguished graduates who do
not accept a commission may be
considered for Regular status at
.9. later date, after entry into ac-
tive duty.

To qualify for the Distinguish-
ed AFROTC Cadet Rating, the
cadet must possess qualities of
leadership and strong moral char-
acteristics, have demonstrated
leadership ability through cam-
pus achievements, and have a
high standing in his academic
and military classes.

—In our society what protec-
tion should be given to the wom-
en who bear the children of our
race?

Jane Gould, senior; Janet Re,
junior, and Betty Bigelow, sopho-
more, spoke in behalf of the pro-
posals providing that women stu-
dents 21 years or over before the
first day of a trimester may live
off campus and women with 90
or more credits may be expected
from curfew regulations if over
21 and with their parents‘ per-
mission if under 21. Taking the
con side, were Ann Boisclair,
senior; Bonnie Meikrantz, sopho-
more, and Susanne Garszczynskl,
freshman.

Presenting the pro point of
view, Miss Gould stressed that
the proposal represented a ‘basic
shifting of responsibility” from
the University to the student.
“The goal of a liberal arts edu-
cation is to produce mature, re-
sponsible adults,” she said. And
students become responsible only
by having responsibilities.

ing regulations for senior women. The panel included sophomore
Betty Bigelow, junior Janet Re, and senior Jane Gould pro; Dean of

Khrushchev Discussed at Midday

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

Branding Nikita Khrush-
crev as an “anti-Midas,” Dr.
Schwartz, New York Times
communism specialist, hypo-
thesized that the slogan of
the new Soviet administra-
tion must-"be “Let's Clean Up

the Mess in Moscow.”
Dr. Schwartz explained to a 400
plus Midday crowd Wednesday

   
   

_Premier’s ouster was

that, “It had become apparent
that everything Khruschev touch-
ed turned to lead. For Dr.
Schwartz the surprise about the
p “the tim-
ing and only the timing.”

The major areas of Khrush-
chev’s failures were economics,
intra-bloc relations, and the Cu-
ban affair.

Concerning the post-Khrush-

DR. HARRY SCHWARTZ chats with students at the Midday Series
Coffee Hour in the Lower Lounge Wednesday. The specialist in mm.
munist affairs from the New York Times staff hypothesized “Let’s
Clean Up the Mess in Moscow” as the slogan of the Soviet adminis-
tration since the ousting of Khrushchev,

chev regime, Dr. Schwartz drew
an .analogy to the situation in
Russia a month after Stalin's
death:
collective leadership, the more
ﬁerce the internal struggle.”

At the presenttime, the policy
of the new leaders resemble the
post-Stalin leadership——to4 avoid
as many difficulties - as possible.
The Soviet Union is again stress-
ing peaceful coexistence, as it
did under Premier Malenkov.

“In the economic area, the So-
viet Union is not doing nearly
as well as Khrushchev prophe-
sized,” Dr.
“The new leaders speak in re-
strained tones; there is no boast-
ing of the Khrushchev variety.”

Khrushchev had made econom-
ic competition almost his by-
word, Dr. Schwartz said. For ex-
ample, Khrushchev predicted that
in 1965 the communist world
would produce more than the
capitalistic world. In reality they
will be lucky if they produce 38
per cent of the output of the
capitalist countries next year.

In 1963, the Soviet Union had
its worst harvest since the, end
of World War II, Dr. Schwartz
pointed out. Soviet officials have
admitted that in the ﬁrst nine

Coal Scuttle Revives
Old University Custom

By TOM cnAn1o'.rr ,
The Intefraternity Council hopes to continue an ‘old
University custom now that an old bucket is back. Many
years ago, no one has been able to determine when, the
University and Penn State vied for a brass coal scuttle,
with the winner of their traditional football game keeping

Schwartz stressed. .

it for a year.

Engraved on the coal bucket are dates and scores of
1893, but the bucket did not come into existence until

sometime.after 1900.

The scuttle bucket, sponsored by the IFC’s of both
schools, was passed between the schools for many years-

Then itdisappeared. When found
again, it was sitting on a desk,
stuffed with play manuscripts.

After the scuttle was cleaned,
it vanished once more for several
years. The scuttle bucket was hid-
den somewhere and was forgot-
ten.

About two weeks after the
Pitt—Penn State game last year,
Parker F. Enwright, assistant
dean of men and advisor to the
IFC, found a large brown box on
his desk. Other than the mailing
.address, there were no markings.
When Enwright opened it, he
found the old bucket had return-
ed, a little battered and slightly
cracked. He presented it at the
next IFC meeting.

At this meeting last Wednes-
day evening, Enwright announced
that plans were being formulated

to have an official presentation
of the bucket to the winner of
this week’s football game.
Enwright noted that other uni-
versities pass similar trophies be-
tween each other, such as “the
little brown jug!’

0 ‘Dr. Harry Schwa/rz, Soviet af-
 -fairs expert for the New York
’ " . Times, visited campus Wednesday

 - “to give a Midday Series Lecture.

> It seems that Khrushchev

  ‘essentially an anti-intellec-
” {tural figure, Dr. Schwartz. I re-

call reading a transcript of his

.negative reaction to modern art

:'i'.:_‘~-and
A seems to me that 1) he distrust-

to avantgarde poetry. It

ed the intellectuals and 2) he fail-

fed to understand them. Do you

1 -see a- new official attitude vis a

- . vis the intellectuals now that there
‘ -"is a new leadership in the So-
viet Union?

You are confusing two things.

- The first is one’s attitude to cer-
tain types of experimentation in
 5*’the art forms; the other is one’s

 attitude toward the intellect. I
 -know a good many people who

don’t care for modern art and

 don’t care for modern poetry,
' but who are extremely intellectual.

The truth is that no complex
modern industrial society can be

,run without relying to a tremen-
 dous degree upon intellectuals. It
0 makes just as much sense for the
' , Russians to be anti-intellectual as

it does for them to be anti-farrn-
‘er. '

’ Now what is the their attitude
toward non-conformity? I think
they've tried to give some indi-

_ cation that they want to concilliate
A "the intellectuals. But I'm quite

‘sure there are limits to the amount

4' of non-conformity the new lead-

ership will stand for.

> Dr. Schwartz, this afternoon
at the Midday Series you seemed
to discount the ideological dif-
ference between the Soviet Union

 Tand Red China. Emphasing that

in interest between the two com-
munist powers. “Would you com-
ment on that?” _

There are many basic differ-
ences between China and Russia,
for hundredsof years, China has
been the weak power and Russia
the ‘strong.

> Everyone has been speaking
in terms of the larger body of de-
cision makers now ruling the So-
viet Union consolidating. Do you
think that there is any chance at
all that this group decision mak-
ing can last in the Soviet Union
or will it inevitably evolve into
a single power.

Nothing is inevitable in life ex-
cept death and taxes. All we can
say is that the experience of the
Soviet Union which is now 47 years
old is that when there have been
periods of collective leadership
or rally oligarchical leadership
that these have. finally been re-
solved with the emergence of one
man as at least the prime figure.
We have to think of Soviet history
to a large extent as the history of
three men: Lenin, Stalin, and
Khrushchev. It is not inevitable
that there be a fourth man who
emerges but the lesson of history
is very persuasive on this score
that we must assume that the
probabilities lie in favor of some
fourth major figure emerging
power. Therefore, China became
the victim of Russian imperialism.

Regardless of what kind of re-
gime existed in China, Communist
or non-Communist China would
eventually have to become anti-
Russian. The Chinese Communists
are riot only Communists—they
are Chinese-and the fact of their
being Chinese is more important
than their being communist.

>Would you say all the South-

Dr. Harry Schwartz  

amples:

 

east Asian Communist parties have
to be Peking-orientated because
of economic, geographical, ethnic
and military reasons.

The rule that the nations next to
a strong power must be satellites
of that power is by no means a
universal rule of international re-
lations. Let me give you some ex-
Iran and Turkey are
not major powers, they don’t have
nuclear weapons, they are next to
the Soviet Union—but they cer-
tainly are not Soviet Satellites.
Cuba is a very weak and tiny na-
tion next to the United States,
yet I'm sure we’ll agree that Cuba
is not an American Satellite.

> If the multilateral nuclear
force were to become a reality,
would Moscow interpret this ad-
versely as an agressive policy on
the part of the West?

The Russians have recently is-
sued an official statement in which
they said they would take unspeci-
ﬁed moves in defense of the so-
cialist camp in the event the mul-
itilateral nuclear force is form-
ed. I’m afraid my blood does
not run cold at this.

I credit the Russians with en-
ough intelligence to assume that,
should a multilateral nuclear force
be formed, they will first study it
and see what it amounts to. Also
let us realize that the United
States is today the strongest nuc-
lear power in the world. This does
not mean that we should engage
in military adventures, but the
Soviet Union, whatever it may say
verbally, fully understands the

powers at the command of the ’

U.S. and, as the Cuban crisis
showed, it is not anxious to pre-
cipitate a test by force with the
U.S.

Discussed

(Continued from Page 1)
months of this year industrial
production grew by only seven
per cent, the lowest rate of
growth since 1946.

Another defeat for Khrush-
chev was his failure to maintain
unity within the Communist bloc.
“In 1953 when Stalin died there
was a monolithic Communist
movement directed by Moscow,”
Dr. Schwartz declared. “Under
Khrushchev’s leadership this
movement is in shambles.” By
the time he fell from power,
Khrushchev had split the world
50 badly. Schwartz claimed, that
the amount of propaganda, di-
rected at the other Communist
countries was comparable to that
which is aimed against the Unit-
ed States.

Khrushchev’s handling of the
Cuban missile crisis is another of
the prime charges levelled against
him, Dr. Schwartz emphasized.
His adventurous actions followed
by his complete capitulation was
a serious blow to the soviet
Union.

“Khrushchev had failed; he
had brought disappointment af-
ter disappointment to the soviet
Union,” Dr. Schwartz said. “Even
his proteges felt that they had
no alternative but to dispose
him.” _

When China "exploded her ﬁrst
atom” bomb after Khrushchev’s
1'em0V31, there was not a word
condemning the Chinese in Prav.
da. The avoidance of all criticism
is an indication that the Soviet
Union didn’t want trouble.

Tower Locks Useless;
Master Key Is Gone

All locks in the Towers have been rendered useless until
the master key is found, according to John Bender, assist-
ant director of men’s housing. In his advisor’s report to
Men’s Dorm Council. Bender said that “nothing is secure
in Towers A, B or C” until the key is found-

Bender stated that it is only a matter of time until the
“culprit” is caught. He will be immediately dismissed from
the University once he is found.

At the same meeting Wednesday night MDC voted that
house alumni will be able to participate in all house activ-
ities except inter-house athetics. To qualify as a house
alumnus, the man must be a full time undergraduate stu-
and have lived in the house for at least one trimester.

The house has the right to refuse the alumnus the right to par-
ticipate in any activity and the house alumnus is not permitted to
hold any of the major house offices. He can participate in the spirit,
social and cultural activities of the house.

MDC President Harvey Lefton announced that MDC and Men’s
Housing Office have agreed on procedures for Open House in the
Towers. MDC will suggest to the Men’s Housing Oifice when it would
like to have a dorm-wide Open House. Each House also has the option
to conduct two regular Open Houses per trimester. President Lefton
expressed his thanks to the Housing Office and Dean Crafts for their

aid in the formulation of these procedures.

Housing Proposals Reviewed

come in later than 12 midnight,
12-30 or 12:45 p.na. She will say
to herself: “I’m coming in be-
cause I want to be in not be-
cause I have to be in.”

In opposition. Miss Boisclair
countered that remonsibility goes
two ways.” Seniors have a re-
sponsibility to underclassmen as
well as to themselves. “Commun-
ity living is sharing, and I feel
there would be some sort of bar-
rier between seniors and under-
classmen. if seniors» had this nee-
dom,” she remarked.

Miss Re, in reply, expressed
her op.-nion that the barrier al-
ready exists because upperclass-
men have different‘ curfews. Her
partner, Miss Meikrautz felt that
the elimination of curfews would
complicate the duties of senior
assistants and desk attendents.
She questioned the pro side’s
“idealistic viewpoint.”

Speaking from the audience,
Doris Turkes asked the seniors to
stand. “Not half of you are sen-
iors,” she explained. “If seniors
are responsible where are the
rest of your comrades? Where
are you going to be after 2 a.m.?
The library is closed, and so are
the bars in Oakland, and it is
against the law to loiter in the
streets.”

Her sister, Lois, a senior assis-
tant, doubted that seniors are re-
sponsible enough to accept the
freedom. She used Election Night
as an example, explaining that
by mistake the desk assistant call-
ed her at 6 a.m. and asked her to
check students who had not sign-
ed in. “Nine seniors and two
freshmen were not in, and I
thought that they were respon-
sible individuals.”

The importance of social pres-
sure on the individual and the
danger of its absence under a
system of no curfews was raised
by Lynn Davidson. “One irres-
ponsible senior would reﬂect on
all of us,” she said. But Ellen
Levitt felt that if curfews were
eliminated the social pressure
would come from one’s peers.

Since many women underclass-
en are over 21, Mary Rindlaub
asked if the proposal could be
rewritten to include them, but no
answer was given.

No mention of the off-campus
housing was made until Gail
Breen brought up the subject.
From the panel came Miss Gar-
szyczynski’s statement that “The
con side approves of the ﬁrst
proposal but if a senior chooses
to live in the dorm, she has to
abide by the regulations.”

Inquiry Cl

The newly-formed Inquiry Club
has instituted a series of infor-
mal colloquia on systems of soc-
ial thought.

The colloquia, according to In-
quiry Club chairman Wolf Swa-
boda, are aimed at remedying “a
great deficiency in the academic
curriculum of the University.”

Karl Marx, for example, con-
tends Swaboda, is dealt with in
most political science courses
through vague abstractions: he
is “too much subject to almost
a priori dismissal.” Marx will
therefore constitute a major point
of connections of the Inquiry Club
in the near future.

The first meeting of the Club was
held Monday, at which Dr. Robert
Herzstein assistant professor of
History at Carnegie Institute of
Technology, discussed “The Genr-

ine emphasis of Dr. Herzstein’s
rested on the inﬂuences of Hegel,
Bauer, Feuerbach, and Proudhon
on Marx, insofar as they changed
him from a radical democrat to
a dialectical materialist.

The years between 1840 and
1846 were the most important in
the formation of Marx's thought on
class structure, on his dialectic
on materialism, and on evolution,
Dr. Herzstein explained. The cul-
mination of various inﬂuences and
considerations are embodied in
The Communist Manifesto, written
long before the first volume of
Das Kapital. Swapoda viewed Dr.
Herzstein’s talk as “not only an
excellent introduction of Marx in

[Background Discussed

 Dean Rush made itquite clear Wednesday night that “administra—
7 -é tors must be educators” and that any decision of such scope as lifting
housing regulations for senior women would be deci-<3--e'».§ by the adminis-

tration as part of its responsibility.

As always, she emphasized how grateful she was for the oppor-
 tunity to hear the thinking of young people. She would never make such
‘ ~ a decision without consulting responsible students, her staff workers,
faculty wives, parents, and other administrative personnel, for this had
"to be a thoughtful decision, not just to keep peace, to co-mpromise with

a minority, or to yield to the majority.

There was a vote yesterday, a referendum to feel out general stu-
dent reaction, but whether through an unconscious oversight or another
conscious admission that mass student opinion was irrelevant to her
, decision, Dean Rush failed to remind the audience of it.
V She di'd not, however, fail to note that only about 75 of over 1000
; women dorm students were in attendance, and as one studentspe-aking

on the con side Verbalized, “Where are your comrades if everyone’s so
. much in favor of it?” Actually more showed up than the hostesses had
1 planned, as some women Wheeled .in a cartload of folding chairs-

 

 

N or did she fail to open the panel discussion with a series of ques-
tions that she said she wanted the audience to think about, questions
which she wouldinot answer:.What is the responsibility of an institution
of education? How much should students have a say in policy that con-
cerns them? How much should students be allowed to profit by their
mistakes? What protection should be given to women in our culture who
bear the children of our race? She did not need to answer the questions—
that was implicit in her very phrasing.

And midway through a. strong pro discussion from the audience,

she turned to the chairman of Housing Board and asked, “Isn’t it true

that Housing Board will grant special permissions?” Dorrie Brand had
no other choice but to say yes, for they do indeed grant special permis-
sions. But what relevance did that have to the general lifting of curfew

restrictions and to an increase of total responsibility?

South Viet Nam Situation

by Avi Porat

(First of a Series)
One of the main issues

 facing the United States this

year is the South Viet Nam

, war. The U.S. government

and people, deeply involved
in that war and heavily

‘committed to a policy of

victory, must ask themselves

S l . how to overcome their past

errors of judgment and

’ tactics in order to reach an

optimal solu-
 tion to the

    
  

 

2 tempt to draw
conclusio n s
.1 concerning
’ political af-
fairs must be
bas ed u p on
analyzing the
situation, try-

Porat
ing to discover its causes
and background, and decid-
ing which policy will suit
us best in achieving an op-
timal solution-

A common error is to an-
alyze the situation in South
Viet Nam using Western

‘norms and standards. Any

comparison between South
Viet Nam and the Western
societies’ culture and polit-

« ical structure is vague an

superficial. '
"South Viet Nam is a coun-

i try in its early stages of

modern development, pass-
ing through changes in the
power structure and proces-
ses. This is a country whose
background in history, ideol-
ogy, national resources and
political regimes, is totally
different from the one we

are used to in the West-

In the first part of these

. articles the emphasis will ‘

be upon the historical back-
ground effecting the present
situation. In the second part
I will draw some conclusions
and arrive at alternatives
for dealing with the present
situation. ’

PRIOR TO ITS intensive
contact with the West, the
Vietnamese social system,
as a whole, was highly inte-

' grated. Viet Nam was a tra-

ditional agrarian society,

4 -. ruled by a monarchial fam-

ily, whose patterns of rul-
ing were similar to the class-
ical Chinese model. The pop-

“ ulation was concentrated in

villages and tribes, with lit-
tle communication with the
outside world Having a very
low standard of living, the
people lacked the needed na-
tural resources to which
could cause any change.

The French domination
over Indo-China, lasting for
nearly 75 years, caused dis-
ruptions in ,a number of di-
mensions of the traditional
social system. Urban centers
were established in different
parts of the country, effect-
ing -a series of social and
economic changes.

Western enterprise moved
in, bringing limi'ted develop-
ment in the fields of indus-
try and mining The changes
effected, directly, only a
small part of the population,
but at the same time caused
the establishment of a dual
economy, the French domin-
ated one, and the Vietna-
mese sector which remain-
ed agrarian.-

THE FRENCH penetra-L

tion also caused a cultural
crisis when knowledge and
values based on ideas of ma-
terialism, rationalism, de-
mocracy and, religious main-
ly Catholic, competed with
the weakened traditional
concepts. This crisis is still

going on as was proved re-.

cently through the Budd-
hists riots-

The war which was going
on in Indo-China since the
beginning of the forties
brought further changes. A
large part of the insufficient
national resources, so badly
needed for development,
were concentrated and ex-
pended destructively in the
military efforts. During the
war the fighting parties re-
cruited, trained and armed
large numbers of troops,
which were often based on
politico-religious sects of the
population.

For example, the munici-

, the

ple police force of Saigon
was under the control of an
organization of former riv-
er pirates. Another example
are the hill tribesmen which
fought at times for the
French and at other times,_
against them, and whom
nowadays the American “ad-
visers” try to recruit for
fighting the Viet Cong-

THIS WAY the war caus-‘

ed further tension between
different sectors in the pop-
ulation, without establish-
ing any new political or so-
cial groups, having enough
power to dominate the coun-
try.

The end of the Indo-Chin-
ese war in 1954 found Viet
Nam divided into two coun-
tries: the Communist North,
having the small but essen-
tial industries of mines, and
the South, which was main-
ly agrarian. Following in-
dependence, Ngo.Dinh Diem,
the man in power, was fac-
ed with the loss of French
capital and qualified‘ man-
power, which left both the
North and the South fear-
ing further Communist vic-

. tories.

Diem faced, and mostly
solved, problems like the re-
settlement of nearly one
million refugees from the
North, and the establish-
ment of temporary peace
between the various sects
and tribes who were ready
to continue ﬁghting each
other, and defeated any sec-
torian challenges to his au-
thority. With a lot of for.
eign help, mainly American,
he carried out a land reform
program that was success-
ful, within its limits, and
made considerable progress
1'n economic development.

On the surface the coun-
try seemed to be developing
steadily in the proper direc-
tion, when suddenly in 1959
Communist guerillas
struck again.

In assuming that marriage and

A iiiUnivers1tyi Considers 

 New ROTC Program

By DENNIS BLAZIEB
Dr- Allan Rankin, vice-chancellor for Student and gen-
eral affairs, is the chairman of a committee now consider-
ing all aspects of "the ROTC‘ Vitalization Act of 1964, to de-
termine which of the three courses now available to most

colleges will be adopted by the University.

For the Air Force, the new law, if accepted, will per-
mit a continuation of the four-year AFROTC program and
in addition provide a two-year ROTC program equivalent to the
last two years of the existing program. The new law also raises the
retainer pay for the advanced AFROTC cadet from $28 to about $40

per month.

Under the new law, cadets enroll in the two-year program and
receive advanced status. They have to attend a six-week summer train-
ing camp in place of the basic course. These cadets would not be re-
quired to participate in leadership laboratory now required in the

four-year program, however.

Lt. Col. William C. Tinsley, professor of Air Science at the Uni-
versity, is recommending that the school‘ continue the four-year course
and begin the two-year offering. He feels that in this way the Uni-
versity can provide both courses of instruction for a trial period in
order to determine which program better suits our school and Air

Force.

Col. Tinsley stressed that the
new program is designed to pro-
vide an education that will de-
velop skills and attitudes vital to
the professional Air force officer,
and to provide commissions for
qualiﬁed college men who seri-
ously desire to serve in the Air
Force. ‘

The Colonel stated that the
Air Force aims to produce about
6,000 officers each year, who will
serve as least the four years of
active duty that the Air Force
requires. He said that the Air
Force feels that it can meet these
requirements with the two-year
program and the two air base
training periods.

Col. Tinsley concluded the new

WW0-Year program would help

those students who were not mo-
tivated to seek an Air Force com-
mission atthe time of ‘initial en-
rollment in the University ._but
who become interested too late
to enter the four-year program,

Co — op Grad
Studyin D.C.

Five Washington, D. C. univer-
sities have started a co-operative
graduate school. program this year
in which graduate students in each
of-the universities may enroll for
courses at any of the other insti-
tutions.

Schools participating are Ameri-
can, Georgetown, George Wash-
ington, Catholic and Howard Uni-
versities.

“Each university remains com-
pletely autonomous, yet draws on
the assets of the other,” said Dr.
Elmer D. West, director of th
cooperative program. ‘

According to Dr. West, “co-op”
students generally take courses
in two universities. Several are
attending classes in three, while
one student is taking courses in
four.

In a few cases, members of the
co-operative program have drop-
ped courses where enrollment was
small and where a similar course
was available at another univer-
sity. Also, the universities have
managed to avoid “excessive du-
plication of specialists” on facul-
ties.

Fire Protection Procedures in Decoratingfor University

For the protection of University personnel and property,
the University Fire Marshal requests your cooperation in the
use of decorations in all University buildings.

1. Use non-combustible material (metal, glass, asbestos,
etc.) to decorate whenever possible. If it is necessary to use
combustible materials they must be flamepxoofed and bear the

resinous evergreen branches or brushed rayon materials must
not be used as they cannot be flameproofed properly.

. 2. When using electrical lighting sets and units, be sure
they bear the Underwriters’ Laboratory label and check before
using for frayed wires, loose connections and broken sockets.

3. Know the location and proper usage of fire extin-
guishers provided, and make sure that one‘ is in the‘ proximity
of the decorations or the tree.

I-‘lameproofing Materials
A flameproofed fabric or material may be defined briefly

as one which is not ignited readily by small sources of ignition
such as a match, cigarette lighter, sparks, etc. , and when

the smoldering combustion does not spread beyond the vicinity
of the source of ignition.
Oren B. Relyea, Fire Marshal and Safety Inspector, C.  on

A number of inquiries have been received from those ime,--
ested in contributing to the memorial to the late Dr. H. C.

Secondly, in choosing to run
everything together without pre-
face or pause, Messrs. Caplan,
Federman and Klein dissolved
what little organization remained
in an already free-form artist.
Zukofsky at least divides and dis-
tinguishes his work into discrete
poems, though he may be very
loose and unorthodox within
them. Preserving these distinctions
would have helped the drifting
listener.

this poetry is too experimental

Caplan’s Mother Press. It sells,

It establishes, for those who
were confused at the reading,
that Zukofsky is not a hoax, that
he is indeed a master poet, with
music and imagination in his tool
kit, and his union dues paid to

 

tradition. In the book's best piece,"
“The Old Poet Moves to a New
Apartment 14 Times,” he makes
the standard tour of the artist's
development in a fresh, succinct
way.

Then there is a poem, on a
page by itself, listed in the
table of contents as “The.” The
entire poem goes: The/desire/of/
towing/. David Federman gives
an enthusiastic explication of
this, involving tugboats pulling
ships and suchlike. Someone else
thinks it might be a zen thing,

like the famous “sound of one

hand clapping.” Ed Roberson sug-

cise in refraining from saying
something, the ultimate in con-

Reviews:

By BOB SUPANSIO

“There are things that I should not be caught crying
about”; thus, Ed Roberson, 1962: Atlantic Monthly Grand
Prize winner, began one of his all too-rare poetry readings,
at the Wednesday evening meeting of Pitt Writers Club.

Roberson’s poetry has always been a poetry of beauti-
ful complexity, sometimes of perplexing complexity. But
the audience at the Writer's Club was hearing a new ele-
ment; complexity that transcended itself back to simplicity, deposit-
ing a rich residue of meaning within each poem.

Everything in» Roberson’s poetry is build on his unique expres-
sion of a striking image:

The ﬂy buzzing against the window and the plane

that for the lack of just that character

somewhere is going down . . .

Other images expand and comment upon the peculiar quality of
the ﬁrst, the theme of the poem:

and in the countryside the circumstance

adds a spoon of dull explosion to the tea

and at the same time in france there falls a rain

adding to what already is without any relation.

Roberson is the poet of terror, or as he calls it, “original ter-
ror.” He writes of the terror that stalks and lurks within our every-
day actions, as he goes on to express in this particular poem:

i am» afraid that some hand not my own

may rise and answer present to my name

that some might debate me on this button

Knowing him personally, I have watched him handle paper, pick

painted, but delicate eggshell: and so, the care,

He spoke softly at ﬁrst, but realizing some were straining to -
hear, he raised his voice, but just a little. At the end of each poem, '
he looked meekly -up at the audience and saw faces looking at him. :

But the audience was tense, and there were plenty of wide-open _
eyes. The poems started out innocently enough, but by the end, you .

could feel Roberson’s small nand clutching your esophagus.

Therein lies Ed Roberson’s great talent: his sense of the re-‘
conciliation of differing, even conﬂicting, images and feelings. He .
writes of two children reassorting the equipment of their childhood, -’
making their goodbye. They have suddenly had something knock for :

them on the doors leading to their own growing up:
but everyone
knows who the black bird without feathers
on its red neck is.
The image is gentile, but like all of Roberson’s poetry, stark.

Sartre Remains ‘Subversive’

(Collegiate Press Service)

J ean—Pau1 Sartre rightly re-
fused the Nobel Prize. Such an
honor is an official stamp of ap-
proval. It is a token of respect-
ability and a ticket of admission
into polite and venerable com-
pany. There is a certain terrible
ﬁnality about such a prize, al-
most like death. It makes Sartre
proper. A philosopher as moral-
ist and critic ought never be pro-
per. When a philosopher can be
discussed comfortably at .a PTA
meeting or quibbled over at pro-
fessional colloquias he has failed.
The philosopher must always be
the ultimate subversive.

Sartre was cited for “imagina-
tive writing, which by reason of
its spirit of freedom and striving
for truth has exercised a far-
reaching inﬂuence on our age.”
The citation also said, “deliber-
ately controversial and ready to
give battle, he carries on the
great French historical tradition,
that of moralists who criticize so-
ciety.” This great tradition is not
limited to the French. Moral criti-
cism of society is one of the es-
sential tasks of the philosopher.
Sartre’s genius is such that he is
able to use literary media as
vehicles for the transmission of
philosophical and moral ideas on
the visceral level. A

As a moralist who is critical of
society he plays the role of sub-
versive and iconoclast. He is an
example of his own ethical doc-
trine of engagement. He is pas-
sionately involved in the social
and political movements of his
time. He is the engaged philoso-
pher, immersed in the intellectual
dialogue concerning values and
creation of them is of vital im-
portance to the world, it is ap-
propriate that Sartre should be
honored by his fellow intellec-
tuals, even though he must re-
fuse the official accolade. Sartre
himself has “dirty hands.” By
accepting the Noble Prize, he
would be putting gloves on.

It is a pity that he is a prophet ’ .

without honor among his fellow
philosophers in this country. Sart-
rte is better known and under-

stood by intellectuals who are in- ’
terested in literature, psychology,

‘-‘:61-2'-.'-,»1.-‘.32’.-2' rt:

or theologr than by professional
philosophers. He, along with John
Dewey, is almost unknown and
untaught in too many depart-
ments of philosophy.

Sartre’s neglect at the hands of
his colleagues suggests that per-
haps philosophy has abandoned
its traditional role as a source
of great ideas and intellectual
challenges worthy of man’s in-
tellectual dignity. Perhaps philo-
sophy has become an esoteric but
proper discipline of no relevance
to the outside world, a discipline
which analyzes and classiﬁes
icons but leaves them intact. The
neglect of Sartre is an index of
abdication.

There is little interchange be-
tween “The Partisan Review” .and
“The Philosophical Review” to
the detriment of the latter and
beneﬁt of the former. We have
nothing comparable to “Les
Temps Modernes,” the journal
of opinion founded by Sartre.
Ideas seem to breed endogamous-

ly in this country. Narrow pro- , —

fessionals speak only to each
other and the world rarely both-

ers to listen.

The tradition of Sartre, Ortega
y Gasset, and Dewey is the grand
tradition of philosophy which
holds that a philosopher must be
engaged in the crucial problems
and issues of his time. This tra-
dition is in danger of being pois-
oned by an anti-intellectual ten-
dency, the passion of which is
to analyze the trivial and to in-
hibit the production of general
synthetic ideas, especially in the
real of values. The mainstream of
intellectual creativity is damned
at its source.

The University of Illinois’ Pro-
fessor Gotschalk said that “some-
thing basically wrong has lurked
in our culture, deep-down in its
institutional fabric, leading to
mounting disaster. We must try
with all the means in our power,
by science and philosophy, to
ﬁnd a better way.” Finding this
“better way” remains an essential
task of the philosopher. If Sartre
has not found that way it is not
because he has not looked.

THE SOCCER PLAYERS respect their coach like William
Steinberg respects the Beatles.

  By Marvin Zelkovvitz

Steinberg might praise
the Beatles for having a new musical form, but would
refrain from copying their style- The players will
nod their heads when Bemis tells them what to do.
Then they go out onto the field and play the best
way they can. So they don’t follow Bemis’ Instruc-
tions. .

That’s the way they’ve been playing soccer this
year, and it is p_art of the reason that they were 4-5
before their game with Penn State. But they played
the same way two years ago when the team went to
‘the Eastern playoffs for the NCAA-

The players felt they were better than every team
they played this year except Maryland, and blame
poor coaching for their loosing season.

ONE PLAYER SAYS his high school coach knew more
about soccer than Mr. Bemis.

The soccer team is so demoralized now, that be-
fore the game with Penn State, one of them said,
“The only way we’ll beat them is if they don’t show
up.”

THE FOOTBALL TEAM has now improved to the point
where they will play an exciting game with Penn State-

Some players are still grumbling about Fred Ma-
zurek’s ineptitude as a quarterback. That’s like say-

_ ing Man-'0-War was a bad race horse.

Penn State’s big weakness in the beginning of
the season was the lack of a coordinated offense, but
in their last two games, they have outscored their op-
position 51-7. O -

PART OF THE REASON for Penn State’s potent late
season offense has "been the quarterbacking of Gary Wyd-

man. He has completed 67 passes for 793 yards and
one touchdavv:n- For a man who had thrown one pass
prior to this year in his varsity career, that’s not bad.

In addition to Wydman, the Lions have a fullback
that has played better_football than ‘Barry McKnight
this year—‘-Tom Urbanik. He has yet to be stopped for
a loss this year, and ‘he has gained 578 yards’ in 114
carries, compared to McKnight’s 519 yards in 122

carries.

THE EXPERTS SAY Penn State’s defense is weak but
both their starting halfbacks Don,Kunit and Bob Riggle
are averaging better than six yards per carry.
And they say State’s defense is better than their
offense We’ll take Penn State in this one, 14-10.

Sellout Crowd at Beaver Stadium

To Watch Traditional Rivals Play

By FRANK SMIZIK

Penn State, an improved
team like the Panthers, will
be the host for the tradition-
al rivalry between the two
teams on Saturday at Uni-
versity Park. The biggest
crowd ever to be at Beaver Sta-

dium, over 50,000 will view the
contest.

After losing their ﬁrst three

games the Lions have won the"
last ﬁve out of six and complete-_

ly overpowered highly rated
Ohio State, a team apparently

headed for the Rose Bowl. They
also have a similar record with
common opponents. Like the
P.anthers, they beat West Vir-
ginia and Army, while losing to
Syracuse, Oregon and UCLA. The
only diﬁerence is that Pitt tied

_ Navy while the Lions lost to the

Midshipmen in their ﬁrst game of
the season.

Besides common opponents the
teams have several like traits.
Through the ﬁrst nine games of
the season both teams are aver-
aging 4.1 yards a gain. First
downs, total yardage and passes
completed show almost identical
statistics. There is a difference
of only nine points in the total
points scored.

Even Coach John Michelosen
compares the two squads. “Penn
State had the sametrouble we
had at the beginning of the sea-
son with injuries and with mak-
ing mistakes,” said Michelosen.
“They have improved because
they have a lot of talent up there
and they have very good coach-
es, and this together with their
making less mistakes has made

POPP

them .a tough team.”

“They’re a well balanced team,”
explained Michelosen, “and
they’re almost equally as good
passing as running with the ball.”
(Gary) Wydman has improved

every game with the experience .
.. he gets and is now a very ﬁne

quarterback. I’d say they were a
little stronger running though be--

cause of their great fullback Tom_

Urbanik and halfback Gary Kling-
ensinith.” ‘

Penn State’s defense has im-
proved also with the return of
middle guard Glen Ressler who
also plays center on olfense when
the team needs short yardage.

He was named ﬁrst team News-‘

paper Enterprises Association
(NEA) All-America. earlier this
week for his offensive play.

The Panthers placed their star
corner linebacker Marty Schot-
tenheimer on the second team
NEA All-America. He has led all
Panthers in tackles this season.

Harriers Prepare forNational Meet.

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

The seven-man cross coun-
try team travels to Lansing,
Michigan, Sunday for the
national cross-country cham-
pionships. Michigan State
University hosts the meet
which draws harrier squads from
all over the United States. The
race will be run Monday morning
at 11:30.

According to coach Jim Baimer,
the competition in the Nationals
will be even tougher than it was
in the IC4A where the Panthers
placed ninth in a ﬁeld of 23
teams. In addition to George-
town, Notre Dame, Villanova and
Michigan State who were the
ﬁrst four ﬁnishers in the ,IC4A,
Oregon and Ohio University must
rate as top contenders for the
title. Banner also noted that the

western teams have dominated
the race for the past three years.

The meet will be run on a golf
course with the planned cross-
country course almost completely
ﬂat with very few hills and only
Patches of trees. This is a mark-
ed change from the IC4A course
at Van Cortland Park in New

York which was almost all hills
and narrow forest trails. The har-
riers have trained on ﬂat, even
courses this week in order to ad-
just to the Michigan State lay-
out.

None of the Panthers sustain-
ed any injuries in last Monday’s
IC4A despite the large number

Hawks Win ECJC Crown

1 Wellington Dreyfuss Threatens

- To Put ‘Cowards’ on Probation
‘ Coach Marvin Zelkowitz of The Pitt News Hawks
football team announced today that he is going to protest
the cancellation of the annual Blood Bowl between that
Daily Collegian Cowards and The Pitt News Hawks.
Zelkowitz said that an official protest has been filed
- with Wellington Dreyfuss, the chairman of the Eastern
Collegiate Journalism Conference. ‘

   

"Chuck's a swinger," says she. "His
Coronet is quick and clean, with a lean
and hungry look. It's equipped with a

carpets, console, spinners, and a "padded
dash. And he said that everything but

hend the seriousness of the mat-
ter,” Zelkowitz said.

“A forfeiture of a football
game is either poor sportsman-
ship or chicken-heartedness.

‘ Either one must be condemned

by the ECJC.”

When Dreyfuss was contacted
in his New York office, at the
Hotel Manhattan, he had not yet
received The Pitt News protest.

“If this matter is true,” Drey-
fuss said, “The ECJC might be

Ron Linal9urg’s Blocking
Bolsters Offensive Squad

By FRANK SMIZIK

Ron Linaburg was a good
tackle last season. but S0
were John Maczuzak and
Ernie Borghetti so Ron Lin-
aburg was a good tackle on
the bench. This season Lin-

aburg is a senior and he’s still a

_ good tackle but for ﬁve games

ne was still on the bench.

Linaburg was injured in the
Oregon game on the sixth play
and was out until the Notre
Dame game. “It wasn’t so bad
missing the William and Mary
game,” he said, “because I didn’t
feel the guys needed me but when
I started feeling better it was
rough on the sidelines.

“When I was ﬁrst injured the
doctor knew I would be out for
ﬁve to six weeks, but I thought
I would be ready sooner. At ﬁrst
I ﬁgured I could play’ in the
West Virginia game and then
the Navy game‘ but my leg just
wouldn't come around. I especial-

— 1y wanted to play in those two

games because of the rivah~ies.”

Linaburg’s leg came around in
time for Notre Dame and with
his blocking he helped the whole
line play as a cohesive unit and
the offense started to pile up the
yardage. He played extremely
well after being sidelined for
ﬁve weeks, and even drew praise
from coach John Michelosen.

Last year Linaburg was un-
known because his partner at
tackle on the second team, Jim
Jones got all the headlines. “I
thought I played well last year, '
however, I put on .a few pounds
this season to give me more pow-
er, but then Jim got hurt.

Linaburg is a scholar along
with his football talents at least
by the amount of subjects he
takes. “I took 24 credits this sum-
mer so I could get into Dental
School this term, and get my de-
gree after my ﬁrst year.” In-
cluded in the 24 credits were both
French three and four.

He prefers Dental School and
says it’s his number one choice,
however; he still has .a chance

of playing pro ball. “No one has

RON LINABURG
Crisp Blocker

contacted me about playing, but
if some one does I guess they
would want me to play offensive
guard or defensive line-backer,
I’d be too light for tackle in the
pros.”

Three Vie for Yogi

With only one week left in the
Yogi competition, three people
are in contention for the -Yogi
crown. George Lies still leads the
yogi race. He leads Marvin
“Isaiah” Zelkowitz, last year’s
champion, by two games. The
coaches had a 13-1 record 1st week
to pull them into a second place
tie with the prophet.

With a two game lead, Lies is
confident of keeping his lead. “I
think I'll win,” he said. “I haven't
