Scholars discuss Soviet perestroika

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Two Eastern European profes-
sors discussed the causes and per-
manence of ”perestroika” in the
Soviet Union yesterday in a semi-
nar in Forbes Quadrangle.

”l think perestroika is irrever-
sible, because it cannot be
pushed aside now. The political
price would be enormous to
pay,” said Dr. Marian Spalinski of
the Polish Institute of Internation-
al Affairs in Warsaw.

He added that he felt that the
decision for the perestroika re-
forms had been made by the
party before G0rbachev’s
election. ‘

Spalinski said that the decline
in the use of terror by the Soviet

government since the Stalin era
has helped to bring about the re-
cent reforms.

He also said that there is no
longer a monopoly on informa-
tion in the Soviet Union, which
has helped in ”opening the
minds of the people.”

Spalinski said that the diminish-
ing use of military power as effec—
tive foreign policy is a third
reason for perestroika.

”There is a growing under-
standing all over the world that
military power is becoming more
and more inefficient as foreign
policy. The last example is Af-
ghanistan,” Spalinski said.

The second speaker, Dr.
Georgy Gunev of the University
of Sofia, Bulgaria, disagreed with
many of Spalinski’s ideas.

”l am not such an optimist,”
Cunev said. ”Perestroika is a
rather confusing term. Gorbachev
and the people around him are
convinced that some new de-
velopments should take place.

”However, for far too many
conservatives, perestroika is just
a term Gorbachev is using as
propaganda. They hope nothing
will change."

Gunev said that though the use
of terror has diminished over the
past two decades, the number of
people in the secret police has
grown considerably. He added
that the government's change in
the use of terror could reverse at
any time.

”Perestroika has failed to

Second assault raises
concerns about safety

By Scot Ross

News Editor

A series of assaults on the Pitt
campus has sparked questions
concerning the safety of the
University of Pittsburgh streets.

Shelly Sharapan, 22, of Oak-
land became the latest victim
Sunday morning when she was
physically attacked on the 3400
block of Forbes Avenue near
Capri Pizza, a police report said.

According to Walt Waters,
director of Public Safety for the
Campus Police, ”She was walk-
ing home by herself from the
Forbes Quad area when two
black males in their early 20s ap-
proached her by the Capri Pizza
and asked her if she would like
to go home with them.

”The victim kept walking, and

the one suspect pushed her from
behind and the victim struck her
head on awall. [One of the men]
then punched the young lady in
the face,” Waters said.
Sharapan was taken to
Presbyterian—University hospital
with contusions on her head and
face. She was treated and
released, the report said.

Waters said the woman could
not give a positive description
other than the fact that the attack-
ers were two dark-skinned black
males.

Sharapan was unavailable for
comment. P _

The safety of Pitt students
traveling through South Oakland
was addressed by Waters. He
said troubles with law enforce-
ment outside the immediate
perimeters of the university occur
”because it's off the beaten track.

You just don’t have [a large] num- .

ber of pedestrians in that area.
Also, our resources — I don’t
want to say they are limited, but
we only have so many people.”

Waters said that up until this
year, the police had been having
problems with crime on Forbes

Avenue and side streets such as,

Oakland and Atwood.

To tackle the situation, V\/aters
said he shuffled certain shifts to
increase the number of officers.
”There is quite a show of police
out there on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday. There are [officers] out
there all week, but we enlarge the
numbers [on those days]/’ he

Environmental program
to be launched by Pitt

By Michelle L. O'Brien
Staff Writer

The U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency has selected the
University of Pittsburgh to estab-
lish a new National Environmen-

tal Technology Applications

Corp. to help deal with local and
national environmental prob-
lems.

«EPA Administrator Lee Thomas
said the research center will ”de—
velop, create and facilitate new
technology  we can take the
best of innovation and help com-
mercialize it and get it into the
marketplace and into our com-
munities.”

”We will be moving beyond
[environmental] regulation  to
sophisticated applications of the
marketing process,” Pitt President
Wesley W. Posvar said.

The EPA will provide $1 mil-
lion in start—up funds and an ad-
ditional $3.5 million over the
next three years, according to
Thomas.

Posvar said Pitt will match
these funds through solicitation of
public and private donations. in
addition, Pitt will provide office
space and equipment for NETAC
in the university's Applied

Research Center in Harmarville at
no cost.

NETAC will employ T8 to 20
people in its first year of opera-
tion and between 80 and 100 wi-
thin five years, according to
Thomas.

Posvar said NETAC may also
produce more jobs through a
’’multiplier effect” of attracting
other similar industries to the
Pittsburgh area.

Thomas said Pitt's reputation
for effective cooperation with lo-
cal business and industry and its
facilities at the Applied Research
Center were the primary reasons
Pitt was chosen over other
universities to host NETAC.

”The University of Pittsburgh
and the city of Pittsburgh itself
have been hands-on, canao peo-
ple,” he explained.

Pennsylvania Deputy Secretary
of Commerce Andrew Greenberg
said the NETAC partnership be-
tween academia, government
and business will be supported
by the state Legislature. ~

”Our economic and environ-
mental futures are closely linked.
Having the means to support a
sound environment is essential if
we are to attract new industries
to Pennsylvania,” Greenberg
said.

PTL head Bakker indicted on tax-related charges

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - A
federal grand jury investigating
the PTL ministry Monday indict-
ed its founder, television evan-
gelist Jim Bakker, for fraud.

Bakker, 48, and former aide
Richard Dortch were charged in
a 24-count indictment with mail
fraud, wire fraud and conspiring
to defraud the public through the
sale of lifetime partnerships in the
ministry's Heritage Village theme
park.

A second indictment of 11
counts charged former PTL Vice
President David-Taggart and his
brother, James, with tax evasion
and conspiracy to impede the In-
ternal Revenue Service in the col-
lection of taxes.

The Taggarts were accused of
diverting some $1.1 million in
PTL funds to pay personal bills
and expenses while failing to
report the funds as income on
their 1983 through 1987 tax
returns.

For those years, according to
the indictment, David Taggart
evaded some $320,000 in taxes
while James Taggart evaded tax-
es amounting to some $175,000.

Soon those four years you thought would never
end will be just a memory. College costs a A
lot. So does setting up an apartment and
dressing for success. Still, you've got to
have wheels to get out there and make
your mark and that’s where we can help.

It you have graduated within the last 12
months with a four year bachelor’s degree;
or are within four months of receiving your
bachelor’s degree; or are a currentgraduate
student, we’ll give you a $400 graduation gift

David Taggart was a special as-
sistant to Bakker as PTL vice
president, and James Taggart is a
former interior designer for PTL.

AMA solution to shortage of nurses meets opposition

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

Pitt's Student Nursing Associa-
tion of Pennsylvania and nursing
organizatons across the country
are actively opposed to a new
program which they believe will
threaten future medical care.

The program, sponsored and
adopted in June by the American
Medical Association, calls for the
implementation of registered care
technicians, to work under hospi-
tal nurses and assist in “acute
bedside care services,” according
to Dr. Joseph Painter, member of
the AMA’s Board of Trustees.

Painter said that the program
was established in response to
the present nationwide nursing
shortage.

”[Hospita|s] may have have to
close entire units because there
are not enough nurses to service
them,” he said. ”We have been

Student Health Service

By Ugochi Oyoyo

Staff Writer

The Student Health Services
office recently received regional
recognition for its health educa-
tion and services.

”We play a significant role in
teaching healthy lifestyles and
prevention,” said Franklin Carter,
director of SHS. ”And Pitt is one

‘ of the leading schools in terms of

the quality of health services it

meeting with nursing [represen-
tatives] over the last several years
but they’ve only focused on long
term solutions. They have not
dealt effectively with short—term
problems.”

David Ranck, executive direc-
tor of the Pennsylvania Nursing
Association, said that the RCT
program is a poor solution to the
nursing shortage.

According to Ranck, the PNA’s
proposed solution to the shortage
focuses on raising salaries, im-
proving working conditions and
making the profession more com-
petitive for men.

"Most physicians are not even
aware the [RCT] proposal exists
and would be opposed to it,” he
said. ”They don’t want another
health giver added to the medi-
cal team.”

Ranck added that the RCT pro-
gram would exacerbate already
strained relations between physi-

provides.”

Carter received the John A.
Hargleroad ll Award for his dedi-
cated and loyal work with student
health. In May, the office
received the Health Education
Award for its videotape on the
consequences of cocaine addic-
tion and its services in educating
the public about health.

The videotape features Devin
Williams, former running back
for the San Francisco ’49ers,

cians and nurses.

”The AMA says [RCTs] will
take guidance from nurses,” he
said. ”The nursing association
wants nothing to do with them.
They don't want the liability.”

According to Painter, the RCT
program would allow nurses to
better perform their ”nursing
chores.”

”Hospitals would carry the bur-
den of any liability issue which
relates to [the RCT’s] training or

performance,” he said. ”lt’s not

an important issue.”

Painter stated that possible
duties for care technicians would
include delivering hot food, en-
suring the distribution of proper
medication and assisting in
providing overall comfort for
hospital patients.

According to Dr. Susan Pore-
man, adviser for Pitt’s Student
Nursing Association, her organi-
zation is presently attempting to

”who became a cocaine addict
shortly after his team won the Su-
per Bowl, back around 1985,”
said Carter.

”After ,he’d gone through re-
habilitation, the NFL paid him to
tour the country and tell students
about the dangers of cocaine. So,
we invited him to come and
speak to our football team.

’.’.We are foremost in the pro-
grams we provide and in the

tremendous amount of,outreach"

raise awareness of the potential
problems of RCTs.

’’I personally question the qual-
ity of health care under RCTs,”
she said. ”Now, you have to have
a wealth of knowledge [to pro-
vide sufficient medical care].”

The AMA has proposed three
levels of training for the RCT pro-
gram which include two, nine
and 18 months of education.

”The [RCT] training guarantees
the minimum requirements,”
Painter said. ”This won't be done
without nurses there to teach
them.”

Ranck said that he does not ex-
pect state legislators to support
the program.‘

”Legislators are angry that the
AMA is infringing on another
profession,” he said. ”We’ve
been involved in an intense cam—‘~
paign to legislators in this area

and found overwhelming sup-
port. They don’t want to license
additional practitioners.”

Ranck also said that the RCT
proposal stems partly from the is-
sue of control in health care.

”Doctors don't control the
health care delivery systems like
they did 10 years ago,” he said.
”Consumers should control it
and the AMA is caught up with
this change and [hasn't] accept-
ed it. RCTs will only fragment
health care.”

”Nursing has tried to make this
a turf battle,” Painter said. ”|t’s
not doctors trying to take over
nursing. It's a patient care
problem.”

According to Painter, the
government estimates a lack of
300,000 needed nurses. This es-
timation is expected to climb to
750,000 in the near future.

we do,” said Carter.

”Every public high school in
the city of Pittsburgh and a few
other areas have received a copy
of the tape. The football team, the
student government president,
the Greeks and some people in
the residence halls have all
viewed it.”

Since his arrival in September
of 1980, Carter has implemented
a number of changes in the
health office itself.

”When I first got here, there
were a lot of complaints about
the time it took to get waited on
at the office,” said Carter.

”So we created the triage booth
in the lobby where students can
check in with a nurse who can
match them up to a clinician who
can treat them. This way, they
don't have to wait for an hour
and a halfjust to pick up a form,

”And when I was first here, all
women's health and gynecologi-
cal services and counseling on
such topics like sexually transmit-

under one roof.

”To reduce this level of crowd-
ing and congestion in the office,
we created the Forbes Clinic in

ing were moved there, while
other counseling we moved to

This ”removed about 5,000
visits yearly from the office,”
Carter said, ”and gave the young
women more privacy.”

”Students also used to have to
walk about five blocks down the
street to get services like blood
work done. We didn’t think this
was a good medical practice, es-
pecially in the wintertime.

”So, we freed up one of the
rooms [in the back of the office]
and set up a lab where we could
do almost all of our hematology
work, like drawing blood and
[taking] ear and throat cultures.

Freshmen and international stu-
dents are the focus of some of
health services’ outreach pro-
grams. ”We’re looking to estab-
lish a CAS-required course for all
freshmen that will include infor-
mation on AIDS and substance
abuse. That should be available
for next fall,” said Carter.

”Generally speaking, our
health services are the trend of
the future. We're minimizing
lengthy and expensive hospital
stays by providing high quality
ambulatory care so we can keep
students. in the classroom.”

The Animated Art Gallery, Inc.
will be exhibiting original car-
toon animation cels in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union Art Gallery this
week.

The exhibit, sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council, will consist
of original animation cels of car-
toon characters such as Bugs
Bunny, Mickey Mouse and Win-
nie the Pooh. Cels from Walt Dis-

An animation cel is a painting
on a clear sheet of acetate. To
make a cel, an animator first
makes a drawing on a piece of
paper. The drawing is then trans-
ferred onto the cel in the ink and
paper department, according to
Michael Hanna, who formed Ani-
mated Art Gallery, Inc. approxi-
mately 2‘/2 years ago with his
partners Dan Hromada and Steve
Kohn.

”A cel is nothing more than an
embellished copy of the anima-
tion drawing,” Hanna said.

department.

According to Hanna, 24 cels
are required for one second of
film. An average feature-length
animated film, such as Who
Framed Roger Rabbit, contains
over 500,000 cels and can take
over four years to produce.

Prices of the art on display
range from $25 for some original
animation drawings to over $200

. for current Disney cels, according

pieces of animated art have sold
for as much as $100,000.

The exhibit will be open from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Tuesday and
Wednesday and from 9 a.m. to 2
p.m. on Thursday.

According to Hanna, more and
more people are getting into col-
lecting animated art, and the
major auction houses in New
York now sell animated pieces.

Hanna believes that the prices
of animated art will continue to
increase as more people become
aware of it. An increase in price

is also likely because many stu— —

dios are now using computerized
animation, which eliminates the
cel process, according to Hanna.

”We have the original anima-
tion drawings and cels that they
used when they created the car-
toons. They are collectible pieces
of art. They're being recognized
more and more as, indeed, pieces
of art, not a cartoon,” Hanna
said.

Concern for campus
safety important issue

It is an unfortunate fact that the Pitt campus is not al-

P ways a safe place to walk, even in the university build-

ings, and students should be aware of the potential risks.
On Nov. 14, a woman was assaulted in Forbes Quad-
rangle. On Dec. 4, a woman was assaulted near Capri

Pizza.

These two incidents have brought to light the dangers
that exist for a Pitt student on campus, especially for wom-
en. Granted, most Pitt students will never experience an
assault. But the possibility is still there.

However, by exercising a little caution and common
sense, students can decrease that chance considerably.

Walt Waters, director of Public Safety, gives some ad-
vice to students: travel in groups, avoid walking late at
night and avoid the spaces in between buildings.

The Campus Police try to keep the campus safe, but be-
cause of their limited resources, they can do only so much.

It is easy to believe that you will never be assaulted.
It is even easier to rely solely on the police for protec-
tion. This is both unwise and dangerous.

As students, we are preoccupied with constant respon-
sibilities and stress. Too many times we take our safety
for granted. It is often bothersome to skip shortcuts to walk
where there are more people, or to find people to walk
with late at night. But when our own safety and that of
fellow students is on the line, it is better to be safe than

sorry.

I've always regarded myself as
a sort of peaceful type of person.
I never advocated war (although
it does provide a tremendous
boost to the economy). I've even

. been to a few protests against cer-

tain military actions. I never really
cared to watch Hulk Hogan
scream at me during profession-
al wrestling matches... that is, un-
til this Thanksgiving.

By chance, I happened upon
some center—ice tickets for the

Pittsburgh Penguins vs. the New. »

York Rangers on Nov. 23. I was
excited because so many people
had wanted them, and I wound
up getting one, and my friend
Scotty-O got the other.

Scotty-O and I had never been
to a professional hockey game
before, and neither one of us
knew what to expect.

I was going to cancel at the last
minute because I didn't know if
I'd really like it. Besides, I didn't
know if anybody else in Pitts-
burgh was going to be there.
However, I decided to go anyway

because they were such great

seats.

Scotty-O and I met at my apart-
ment, partook of some refresh-
ments and gossiped about who
was doing what to whom. Final-
ly, at around 7 p.m. we left for the
game that was to begin at 7:30
p.m.

Of course, all of the parking
lots were full by that time, so we
had to park in someone’s back-
yard for a certain fee. To top it off,
we parked about a mile from the

The big problem we had then
was trying to decide how to take
our beverages into the Arena
without being asked to leave
them outside. We decided that
we would drink them on the mile
hike to our seats.

When we neared the Arena, I

There was a great sigh of relief
in Washington, D.C., last week
when a vindictive ethics bill was
vetoed by a benign President
Reagan. The veto preserves the
opportunity for retired adminis-
tration appointees and former
members of Congress to make a
buck the same way they have
done in the past.

A WhiteiHouse insider, now
on his way out, told me, ’’If
signed, this bill would have des-
troyed the democratic American
way of life. What good does it do
for a man to serve his country
when he can't sell his connec-
tions to the highest bidder once
his term is over?”

”Does that mean you are
against ethics in Washington?” I
asked him.

’’I am for ethics. Everyone in
Washington supports ethics, but
at the same time, too much can
choke you. One of the reasons
many people join the govern-
ment is for the golden parachute
they get at the end of the rain-
bow. Some former congressmen
and executive appointees have
few skills other than the sale of
their influence to the highest bid-
der. An ethics bill would destroy
the profit incentive for many who
are now leaving the Reagan ad-

many people were there waiting
to get in. I didn't know hockey
was so popular in P’burgh!

We were in section C8, which
took about 20 minutes for us to
find. By the time we scraped and
crawled to get into to our seats,
the Pens had already scored two
goals.

My first impression of profes-
sional hockey was how stupid the
organ player was. Maybe I had a
bad experience as a child with
electronic organs, but I really
don't like them. The person was
trying very hard to get the crowd
to clap to something that sound-
ed like ”The Munster’s Theme.”

Scotty-O and I finally settled
down to watch the game. The
guys were skating with their
sticks, and everything was dandy.
Then all of a sudden, Mario
Lemieux was skating into the
Ranger zone, and the crowd went
nuts.

This really strange—looking man
stood up in front of us and
screamed, ”It’s a hockey night in

ministration.”

”You see no conflict of interest
in peddling your connections to
the private sector?”

”Of course not. It is essential
that lobbyists maintain access to

ART
BUCHWALD

the right people in our govern-
ment. And it isalso important that
clients deal with legitimate in-
fluence peddlers rather than pho-
nies who pretend they‘ know
somebody but don't.” [...]

”I have heard it said that you
shouldn’t grease the wheelsfor
the same officials who knocked
on your door when you were in
the government. What do you
have to say to that?”

”No bill in Congress can stop
anyone from doing wrong. Look
at the members of the Reagan ad-
ministration who have been con-
victed. Do you really believe an
ethics bill would have prevented
any of their misdeeds? If you start
passing laws restricting lobbying
techniques you will deter good
men from joining the govern-
ment. There are many people out
there who will not sign up if they
can't sell out when they leave.”

Pittsburgh!” I laughed so hard, I
thought‘! was going to cry -— this
50-year-old guy was jumping up
and down and ye|ling..(I thought
only Pitt fans did that.)

A word of advice to novice fans
of any sporting event: don't con-
sume large quantities of any
beverage when you are planning
on attending a game; you make
a lot of enemies when you ask
your neighbor to move.

The fights started almost im-
mediate|y.(At first I thought -that
every time a player checked
another, they were trying to start
something. It turns out that it is

_ perfectly legal to shove someone

into the glass.) I'm talking about
the real fights. You know, the
ones where they throw down
their sticks and wallop the hell
out of the other guy.

At first, the pacifist within me
said, ”Oh now, this is silly,” but
after the goalie for the Rangers hit
one of our guys, this Dr.
Jekyll/Mr. Hyde transformation
overtook me.

Insiders breathe sigh of relief  

’’Doesn’t that add to the sleaze
factor?”

”Why are you introducing the
sleaze factor, when all we're talk-
ing about is honest influence ped-
dling? Washington has always
operated by the old school tie.
When you're on the inside your
actions are affected by those on
the outside, and vice versa. It is
important that everyone knows
who the influence peddlers are.
Ethics regulations will only drive
them underground and then we
will never know who is being
paid off and who isn’t.”

”You make a convincing argu-
ment for the Reagan veto."

”I have to. I'm joining O. Joy,
Malloy and Nufsinger (CQ), as
soon as I leave government."

”What will you do for them?”

”I have been hired to get a pho-
to opportunity with the President
and Ferdinand and Imelda Mar-
cos in the Oval Office.”

”Can you do that?”

”Just because I'm leaving the
White House, doesn't mean they
are going to shut the revolving
door in my face.”

columnist for the los Angeles
Times.

‘Pacifist’ seduced by the thrills and spillsof hockey

”Hit the mother—[bIeep]—er with
your stick!” I yelled.

Scotty-O, who had now taken
to mimicking the old guy in front
of us, stood up and screamed,
”It’s a hockey night!”

All of a sudden, I was looking
forward to these players beating
each other up. I wanted to see
blood, and I wanted it right then
and there.

Now I love the game. When I
see it on TV, I yell, ”|t's a hockey
night!” much to my roommates’
shock, and I throw around such
terms as ”checking” and ”center
ice.”

Maybe my problem was that I
never got to vent my frustrations
before and the Rangers just hap-
pened to be there when I did.

Now before all you pacifists
out there begin to write me, I still
don't like war (who does?), and
Hulk Hogan still does not appeal
to me.

But, if anyone happens to have
an extra hockey ticket, come up
to the newsroom.

The Cold War not over, but the rules havechanged

On her last visit to Washington,
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said the Cold War is
oven

I disagree. It has merely opened
a new front.

CAL
THOMAS

Hunters will testify that there is
nothing more dangerous than a
wounded bear, and the Soviet
bear has been seriously, but not
mortally, wounded by its tacit ad-
mission that Marxism is not the
wave of the future.

While Mikhail Gorbachev’s
”perestroika” is a clear ac-
knowledgement that com-
munism in its present form is
more likely to bury itself before
it buries the United States, the
remain a distinct
threat to order in the world so
long as they are determined to
use their military might (or threat-
en to use it in places like Estonia
and Latvia) to force compliance
with Moscow's desires-.

How best, then, to counter

Gorbachev’s brilliantly disin-
genuous strategy?

Henry Grunwald, the U.S. am-
bassador to Austria, points the
way in a Washington Post essay.
Noting that the benefits to the
West of ”the dismal faiiure of
Marxism as an economic, politi-
cal and social system  will not
come automatically,” Grunwald
writes that we must ”substitute
for a failed Marxism the continu-
ing success and expanding
relevance of our own system.”

A good place to start foreign-
policy ”perestroika,” American
style, is in the West African na-
tion of Guinea-Bissau. This poor
country could serve as a kind of
”test market” for what Grunwald
proposes.

Since its declaration of in-
dependence from Portugal in
1973, Guinea-Bissau has gone
through a numbef of internal
power struggles, culminating in a
bloodless coup in 1980 that
brought the current government,
headed by Gen. Joao Vieira, to
power.

Initial economic and military
assistance came from the Soviet

Union and Guinea—Bissau adopt-
ed a strong centralized govern-
ment in the Soviet mold, yet that
system of government failed the
people of Guinea—Bissau, where
the per capita income of $165 is
one of the world's lowest.
Then, over the past two years,
with the help of Peace Corps
volunteers, small grants from the
U.S. Agency for Independent De-
velopment, and the encourage-
ment of American Ambassador
John D. Blacken, the government
began experimenting with fun-
damental elements of a free mar-
ket economy. Slowly, certain
basic staples of life emerged and
Soviet influence began to ebb.
The low point, from a Soviet
point of view, occurred last week
when a three-member American
delegation visited the country as
part of the city of Cacheu’s 400th
anniversary observance. Accord-
ing to one member of the dele-
gation, Robert Sweet of the White
House staff, Vieira favorably
mentioned the United States
three times in his speech and
completely ignored the Soviets.
Sweet says that Blacken was the

only ambassador to sit with
Vieira, while the Soviet ambas-

sador was relegated to a separate

reviewing stand.

While the United States proved
what its military could do to
reverse communist inroads in

Grenada, Sweet believes that_

American economic ideas could
loosen Soviet footholds in coun-
tries like Guinea—Bissau.

Sweet thinks the first goal for
the United States ought to be
educating leaders of developing
nations about the free market sys-
tem. ”They are not yet convinced

_that it is the best,” he says. He

would like to see such nations en-
couraged by the secretary of
state, A.I.D. and the Peace Corps,
to believe that America has an
economic model that works,
wherever it is tried.

In a nation with fewer than 1
million people, a small invest-
ment can yield quickly measura-
ble results. For example,
Guinea-Bissau needs only about
half a dozen fishing boats and
some processing equipment to
establish the core of a profitable
fishing industry, bringing in-

creased employment along with
the hope and dignity that accom-
panies it.

The attraction with a nation like
Guinea-Bissau is that it offers an
opportunity for both liberals and
conservatives to find common
ground, unlike the case of
Nicaragua, where policy dis-
agreements led to diplomatic and
military gridlock. Guinea-Bissau
offers a chance to incubate a free
market economy and, when that
works, perhaps democracy,
without a shot being fired.

While military aid is still ap-
propriate in other areas, a ”free—
dom race” would be a
worthwhile policy that the in-
coming Bush administration
might pursue with gusto. In so

doing, it would not only put the ‘

Soviet Union on the defensive
but would force the Democratic
Congress to either go along or
pay a heavy political price.

SGB needsto take action to inform studentson crime

The significant andioverriding
fact in I the circumstances sur-
rounding the ”indecent assault”
of Nov. 14 in Forbes Quad is that
while a memo was passed
through the departments of histo-
ry and sociology, the university as
a whole was not informed of the
incident. No one can dispute the
necessity for information sur-
rounding assaults and rapes to be
speedily and accurately reported
to the student body. Yet, the fact
remains that the responsibility of
informing the general student
population of this occurrence
was taken up by a handful of
students—at-large and notan es-
tablished organization.

We must not rely on the moral
vigilance of independent students
to protect ourselves from crime.

We must turn words into
deeds.

Since Craig Jackson expressed
to The Pitt News that action of

Mort’syelling and screaming not ’bad’,

Imagine someone screaming
various obscenities in your ear for
one solid hour. Sounds exciting,
doesn't it? Well, at least the au-
dience who attended The Morton
Downey Jr. Show on Sunday
evening in David Lawrence Au-
ditorium seemed to think so.

Mort, as his fans lovingly call
him, is boring. Sure, his tasteless
profanity and rudeness is a lot of

fun at first, but it just got to me
after a while. I'm not saying that
it offended me; I think rudeness
is funny, but I am saying that it
was a waste of my money to have
someone yell at me.

' Like I said, I like rudeness. I like
sex also. But I can only enjoy the
first 15 or so minutes of a porno-
graphic movie without getting
bored. In both instances the pro-

or

LETTERS

some form should be taken to
better inform students, I shall pro-
pose to Mr. Jackson a suggestion.

Mr. Jackson, as SGB president,
you state that you are ”here to
protect the student body.” (The
Pitt News, Dec. 1, 1988) Turn
these words into deeds. Use the
funds and initiative your position
affords to establish an infor-
mation-receiving network. Make
it accessible to students. Hang
posters with a telephone number
which students can use to report
on— and around-campus crime.
Do this in association with the
Pittsburgh police so that patterns
of repeat criminals can be traced.
Do this in association with the
campus director of Public Safety
and The Pitt News itself.

Then, not only will you be able
to say, ”We are here to protect

fanity isfun at first, but it be-
comes old quickly..

As I waited in line for nearly
two hours to get a good seat on
Sunday, I was excited. I liked
Mort, although I admit I've only
seen his show on television a
handful of times. He usually has
exciting and talkative guests, and
he is_never afraid to speak his
piece. Sunday night, however,
was different. The guests were a
bunch of nobodies and ‘really
didn't offer Mort much of a
chaHenge.

Perhaps the most outspoken
guest he had was a freshman pre-
med majoring in microbiology,
whatever that is, and one guest,
dubbed ”the fat man” by the
screaming audience, never said
one word. Give me a break. On
top of that, The Pittsburgh Press
reported yesterday that one guest
oversimplified his views for the
sake of an argument. So, is Mort
a wimp as well as boring? I think

the student body,” you can also
say, ”We are actively protecting
the student body.” [...]

Patrick T. Madden

As students at the University of
Pittsburgh, we are concerned that
The Pitt News did not inform us
about the Nov. 14 incident (in
which a student was allegedly
raped and knocked unconscious
in a Forbes Quadrangle stairwell
at 7:20 p.m.) until Dec. 1, 2%
weeks after the incident.

We are aware that several peo-
ple, having heard of the incident
by chance, informed The Pitt
News on Nov. 18, if not earlier.
But The Pitt News chose not to
do a story. In spite of the failure
of The Pitt News to disseminate
this crucial information, two
department chairpeople thought
the situation serious enough to in-
form and warn their departments.
Several students found out and

that the fact that many of the
guests simply laughed and patted
each other on the back when
Mort scorned them says it all.
Some guests even joined the
crowd in their own defamation.

I think Mort is probably a hypo-
crite as well. I say ’’probably’’ be-
cause I don't really have too
much hard evidence. During the
discussion on the legalization of
drugs, someone, speaking from
one of the microphones placed in
the audience, said that many peo-
ple don't trust doctors. Mort
responded, ”Especially the ones
who drive Mercedes-Benzes.”
Call me an imaginative fool, but
I would venture to guess that Mr.
Downey doesn't drive a Volks-
wagon Beetle.

Another note of hypocrisy:
Mort is the self-proclaimed voice
of working—class America. Mr.
Downey received a bachelor's
degree from New York Universi-
ty, a law degree from Boston

posted the information to inform
the rest of the student body.

Only after this information was
posted and circulated and many
students expressed shock and
concern that they had never been
informed, was The Pitt News
willing to print a story. Regardless
of whether the incident was a
rape or an ”indecent assault,” we
feel that as our student news-
paper, The Pitt News has an ob-
ligation to inform students
immediately of incidents which
are of direct concern to us and to
our safety.

University and a Ph.D. from the
University of California. Some
working-class hero. I. guess he
tries to relate to the working class
by using a lot of foul language.
Obviously, by doing so, he is
mocking the working class by
suggesting that profanity is the
only mode of communication
they understand. Mort is not
working class; he is white trash.

Another note about Mort’s
”working-class ties.” Evoking
laughter from the audience, Mort
bragged about receiving even
more money from the Pitt Pro-
gram Council than orginally
reported. P

’’It wasn't $10,000, baby, it
was $12,000,” he said.

I'm. sure that that statement
would make a lot of the poor
farmers feel grand.

Before anything, however,
Mort is a bully. I'm not sure there
is anything wrong with that on
the surface, but it's kind of silly‘

 

to suggest that a topic such as the
legalization of drugs will be dis-
cussed, when in fact no one is al-
lowed to speak. Whenever
someone tried to voice his opin-
ion, Mort shouted profanities at
him. It's pointless to mediate a
talkshow on which no one is al-
lowed to talk.

Notice that I said Mort shout-
ed profanities at the male section
of the audience. Mort was very
kind to the females in the au-
dience. I don't really know what
to say about that. Maybe, in at
least that respect, Mort isn't an
idiot.

Mort’s future bride_brings me to
the fact that, according ‘to the
horse's mouth, he has been mar-
ried three times. So much for
middle-class American conser-
vatism.

Y97 FM pays homage to condoms Assault

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer

In celebration of National Con-
dom Week, WMYG FM, Magic
97, created a condom promotion
which is both serious and not so
serious.

The public service announce-
ment, in the form of a song,
warns the sexually active to wear
a condom to reduce the risk of
AIDS. The song tackles the issue,
however, in a way perhaps not
traditionally used by an elemen-
tary school nurse. The song has
raised some controversy.

The song, to the surprise of
about half of the people who
have heard it, uses language
which is within guidlines for
programming content set by the
Federal Communications Com-
mission, according to Carl
Grefenstette, head of promotions

at the radio station.

Reform

Grefenstette said that about half

of the listeners have complained
because they are worried about
their children hearing the song's
questionable language.

”Many of the people that have
complained probably had their
stereo on while the kids were
around and were angry that they
had to explain some of the termi-
nology to them,” he said.

”Every possible adult term is
used, and that's causing quite a
stir."

The song begins the light-
hearted chorus, "Your love life
will be sweeter if you wrap your
peter -— Keep a ring in your pock-
et everyday. If you don’t think
you love her, you'd better use a
rubber,” and continues with
verses such as, ”Before you at-
tack her, wrap your wacker.
Don't be silly, protect your
willy.”

When asked why WMYC,
which plays classic rock ’n’ roll,
took this approach toward AIDS

of changes in order to affect more
of the ordinary people,” Gunev
said. ’’In this respect, it is produc-
ing some kind of cynical ap-
proach among the rank and file
Soviets.”

Gunev added that the conser-
vative attitude of many govern-
ment officials and the apathy of
the citizens could reverse peres-
troika.

prevention, Crefenstette said,
”We wanted to play something
which is both humorous and
educational.”

The song began receiving air
play last week, and because of a
great deal of positive criticism it
will continue to be played on the
radio through this week, accord-
ing to Grefenstette.

Crefenstette said that a lot of
people have called the station to
request the song and have en-
thusiastically praised its content.

”Some people have even
called asking if they could obtain
a copy of the song for friends in
other cities,” he added.

The Pitt men's track team got
their first test of the young season
last Saturday when they traveled
down to Morgantown, W.Va., to
take on the Mountaineer track
team. The meet was not scored,
so there was no officially
declared winner.

Head coach John Vasvary ex-
plained that at ”this time of the
year you don't really want [to be]
scored. You're more con-

Football team wen t through tough '88 season “

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

The Pitt football team finished
the 1988 campaign with a 6-5
record in what could be consi-
dered a disappointing season by
a lot of people. One of them is
not Coach Mike Gottfried.

”Nobody will ever make me
say that this is a frustrating year,"
Gottfried said. ”We made a few
mistakes and we are going to
learn from them. We just didn't
tie some of the loose ends

together. We were a few plays
away and we'll get better.

”We’ll just keep looking and
we'll look back and evaluate and
re—evalute and try to figure out ex-
actly what did happen.”

The Panthers started off the sea-
son in fine fashion by beating a
greatly overmatched Northern
Iowa team (59-10) and an Ohio
State team (42-10) that also had
a tough season.

Then trouble hit. West Virginia
(No. 2 in the nation in the final
AP poll) came to town and Pitt
was just no match, losing 31-10.
Quarterback Major Harris threw
for 61 yards and ran for 55. The
big star of the game was Pitt trans-
fer A.B. Brown.

Brown trampled the Panthers,
running for 110 yards and scor-
ing a 64-yard touchdown in the
third quarter that broke the game
open.

This was the only game the
Panthers lost this year in which
they were thoroughly beaten.

For their first road game, Pitt
traveled to Boston College and
lost 34-31 on a second-half
comeback by the Eagles.

The wrestling team returned
home Sunday after a highly suc-
cessful outing at the Las Vegas In-
vitational.

Pitt head coach Rande Stott-
lemyer said, ”This was our best
tournament so far, without a
doubt”

Pitt finished seventh overall
and is currently flanked 15th in
the nation by the National
Wrestling Coaches Association
poll. The Amateur Wrestling
News ranked Pitt 12th earlier in
the season.

Pitt passed up the Penn State
Duals last weekend to participate

cerned with training, getting
better."

Vasvary and his staff ran the
athletes extremely hard during
the week leading up to the meet,
and so he thought it best to rest
some of them for the meet itself.
Noticeably absent were some of
the distance runners who are just
coming off a grueling cross coun-
try season.

All in all, Vasvary said he was
”very, very pleased” with the
performance of his team on Satur-
day. Judging from the results, he

in the Las Vegas tournament.
Stottlemyer chose to forego PSU
because of the dual-meet format
the Nittany Lions adopted.

Stottlemyer said, ”We wanted
individual competition and opt-
ed for that kind of tournament as
soon as Penn State went to a
dual—meet concept. As it turns
out, Las Vegas is one of the best
tournaments in the country to go
to.”

Five Pitt wrestlers placed in the
tournament. Robert Simpson
placed seventh at 118 pounds,
and Matt Rizzo finished up fifth
at 126 pounds. These two grap-
plers put in impressive efforts, ac-
cording to Stottlemyer.

has every right to be.

Although the meet itself was
not scored, individual times were
recorded. As a result, several Pan-
ther runners have already quali-
fied, after this one meet, for the
Eastern Championships to be
held March 4.

Eric Canon finished first in the
55-meter hurdles and fourth in
the 200, qualifying him for the
Eastern Championships in both
events. Freshman Sam Rice quali-
fied in the 55 dash and also in the
200, finishing first in that event.

said afterward.

Control is something the Pan-
thers had often in 1988; the
problem was that they just
couldn't put teams away. The
Boston College game was just the
start, and it was a sign of what
would come later.

Notre Dame (No. 1) came into

eighth, and heavyweight John
Owens placed fifth.

Defending national champ Pat
Santoro (142) was the winner in
his weight class, and his closest
match was a six-point advantage
as he dominated the field.

Bill Lewis (177) did not place
but had an excellent individual
effort. Two weeks ago, he lost to
Iowa States (No. 4) Jim Nelson
by a score of 7-2. This past
weekend, Lewis crushed him by
an 8-2 tally.

”That’s really the kind of
progress you want to see one of
your kids making. He really wres-
tlediwell, and I want to single him
out for his effort,” Stottlemyer
said.

Tony Brookover and Dom Duel-
ley also excelled on Saturday,
finishing first and second respec-
tively in the 800 as well as both
running a leg on the 4x400-relay
team that took‘ first place in the

Both Brookover and Duelley

OSU assistant coach Bruce

with the Panthers wrestling outfit.

”They have a good, solid
lineup in all weight classes. That

tough.

”Santoro looked rock solid as
usual. He totally controlled this
tournament. I know he has that
one loss to Mike Cole from Clari-
on [at the Ohio Open], and those
two should prove to be an in-
teresting matchup all season,”
Burnett said.

Rookie Lane not making big splash ,,
while coming off bench in Denver

A few pieces left over from a
sports weekend:

0 Former Pitt basketball starJer-
ome Lane, now of the Denver
Nuggets, had his best game of the
season Sunday night. He played
15 minutes, had six points and a
team-leading eight rebounds.

Not exactly great for a first-
round pick. Then again, not too
bad for a rookie on a team with
five solid starters, at least seven
of whom can come off the bench
adequately, a coach (Doug Moe)
who is notoriously hard on rook-
ies, a player who needed at least
one more year of college ball to
work on his deficiencies and
someone who held out for more
money (which he didn't really
deserve). Well, OK, maybe I'm
wrong.

0 A sign of the times for Pitt
fans. The early season basketball
games have not yet had a full
house. Could it be that the Pan-
thers are not ranked in the top 10
this season? Can it be because of
the unavailability of tickets? Gee,
I wonder.

0 The Indiana University soc-
cer team won the NCAA cham-
pionship Sunday by defeating
Howard University l—O. Not that
this should be that interesting to
Pitt people, but Indiana is a simi-
lar situation. They have a peren-
nial power in basketball, they
have a good football team, and

they get 5,168 fans to see the fi-
nals. Pitt probably averages about
I00 at soccer games.

Now, granted the Panthers ar-
en't a soccer power at this time,
but who knows what they could
do with a little more support?

0 I saw somebody walking
around Oakland last week wear-
ing a Pitt jacket and a Boston Cel-

 

VINCE
CAREY

tics hat. How interesting,
someone who supports two
teams not headed to the postsea-
son this year.

O The Heisman Trophy voters
got it right this year. Oklahoma
State's Barry Sanders was the best
player in college football this sea-
son. Not to take anything away
from the other candidates, but his
numbers are hard to top. Sanders
ran for 2,553 yards to break Mar-
cus Allan’s record by 211 yards,
and he scored 39 touchdowns.

0 People would have a hard
time coming up with an NBA
team that could defeat the likes
of this one: You put Mark Jackson
at point guard, Michael Jordan at
shooter, Charles Barkley and
Dominique Wilkins at the for-
ward position and Greg Ander-
son taking care of the middle.
Then you bring Alvin Robertson,
Joe Barry Carroll and Ron Ander-
son off the bench. Pretty solid, if
I do say so myself.

0 In the final AP college foot-
ball poll of the season, Miami
(Fla.) is locked in at No. 2. They
should be No. l, but undefeated
Notre Dame is there. If West Vir-
ginia (I I-0 and No. 3) upsets
Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl,
the Hurricanes should be named
the champion. They are the best
team this year, with Florida State
a close second.

0 The best game of the NFL
season may have been played in
the Houston Astrodome Sunday
night. Pittsburgh, looking very
much like a real team, defeated
the Oilers 37-34 on a last—minute
touchdown.

The Steelers didn't fold in the
end when Houston went up with
less than two minutes to play. It

University of Pittsburgh Department of

may have breathed some life into
the team and Coach Chuck Noll.
He even shook hands with Oiler
coach Jerry Glanville following
the game.

Besides winning the game, the
Steelers all but assured them-
selves that they won’t get the first
pick in the draft this season. Great
strategy. Get a middle—round pick
when you need a top player.
Good thinking.

0 A man once said, ”History
repeats itself.” When the Dallas
Cowboys came into the NFL,
they were regarded as one of the
worst teams in the league. Then
they went on to become one of
the best during the T9705. Now
they are again one of the worst,
sporting a 2-12 record and offi-
cially eliminated from the
playoffs.

Not that they have bad players,
it's just that they were killed by
their winning seasons. For years
it was said that the Cowboys had
guys sitting on their bench who
could start for any other team in
the NFL. Instead of trading those
players for draft picks, they just
let them sit. Brilliant strategy.

0 Driving to Syracuse, N.Y., is
a bad idea. If it ever pops into
your mind, dispel it immediately.

0 Shame on Mike Tyson. He
showed up at the gym with about
25 pounds of extra baggage. If he
doesn't slim down, he might
have to postpone his next fight.
Wouldn't that be something new.

° Unless Eddie Murray can
play second base for the Los An-
gles Dodgers, they made a bad
trade in getting him. With Steve
Sax gone to the Yankees, the
Dodgers have a big hole to fill.

0 Can the Pens hang on to the
top spot in the Patrick Division
for the whole season? Only time
will tell, but they look pretty
strong right now. The difference
between the team this season and
last is that now the Penguins are
playing together. It's not just
Mario Lemieux anymore. There
is a new hero every night. That’s
what they have to do to win.

0 Keeping everybody on the
edge of their seats is the AFC
West race. The Seahawks, Raid-
ers and Broncos are tied for first
with identical 7-7 records. This
should be renamed the ”.Pete
Rozelle Dream Division.” Parity
reigns supreme.

0 Seattle may be the NBA
offensive team to watch this sea-
son. Over the weekend, they
scored 154 points in a win over
the Clippers and 136 points to
beat the Warriors. The thing
about this is that they held Los
Angeles to I04 and Golden State
to I06. So they must play some

lead into halftime. That just about
killed the game.

A couple of good breaks and
Pitt could be 4-1 instead of 2-3.
It was time to make something
happen.

Pitt went on a four-game win-
ning streak against Temple (42-7),
Navy (52-6), Rutgers (20-10) and
Penn State (14-7). They looked to
be on a roll, but the bottom sud-
denly dropped out.

On Nov. 14, the Panthers
found out that they were not go-
ing to a bowl game despite a 6-3
record. It had to affect the team,
no matter what they said.

It showed the next week when
the team traveled to N.C. State.
Pitt came out flat and played that
way throughout the whole game
on the way to a 14-3 loss.

Then in their final game, they
bowed to Syracuse 24-7 to finish
the season on a bad note.

What went wrong?

pens on offense,” senior middle
linebacker Jerry Olsavsky said.
”On defense, everyone went out
for every game; no one gave Up.
It's just hard going out there all
the time knowing the game could
be out of our hands.”

When asked how he would
sum up the season, Olsavsky only
said one word: ”Long.”

Whether it was the loss of a
bowl game or not, Pitt did have
their troubles, which must be
solved before next season begins.
They didn't beat a team with a
winning record all year. If some-
thing doesn't happen, everybody
will be in for a long 1989.

Bruce happy with Lady Panther recruits

The 1988-89 basketball season
is just beginning, but University
of Pittsburgh women's basketball
coach Kirk Bruce cannot help get-
ting excited about the 1989-90

season already.

The reason relates to four play-
ers Bruce and his staff signed to
letters—of-intent during the early
signing period in November. The
Lady Panthers’ coach believes all
four recruits are blue—chip
prospects.

”We’re really happy with the
people we signed,” Bruce said.
”Not only are all four quality
players, they are tremendous
kids. That's important to me.

’’I am expecting all four to
come in here next year and make
an impact,” Bruce added. ”That’s
the type of players they are.”

The four recruits include:

Maureen McConnell, a 5-foot—4
point guard from Seton-LaSalle
High School, who averaged 16
ppg, 4.8 assists per game and 3.6
steals per game in three years.

McConnell was selected to the
1987-88 Post-Gazette top—five
team and the Almanac top—11
team. She is the sister of Olym-
pic gold medalist Suzie
McConnell.

”Maureen will make her own

name for herself here,” Bruce
said. ”She is everything you want
in a point guard; she has great
sense for the game and is an un-
derrated leader. Her bloodlines
will definitely help.”

Lisa Fessler, a 5-8 off—guard
from Erie McDowell High
School, averaged 16.4 ppg as a
junior last season. With 1,155
career points, she is 50 points
away from becoming McDow-
ell's all-time leading scorer and
500 points away from being the
all-time leading scorer in Erie
girls’ scholastic basketball history.

She also averaged six rebounds

”Lisa is very hard—working, and
that means she'll improve ,”
Bruce said.

Jill McElhinny, a 5-10 forward

from Williamsport, Pa. (Loyal-

sock High School), is Lycoming
County's all-time leading scorer
and rebounder with 1,558 points
and 931 rebounds. Selected to
Street & Smith's 1988 preseason
U.S. All—America team, McElhin-
ny averaged 24 ppg and 12 rpg
last season.

”Jill’s offensive skills are obvi-
ous,” said Bruce, ”but, she is

probably the best defensive play-
er in the country. She is just un-
believable. She'll definitely be an
immediate impact player.”

Turia Ransom, a 5-11 forward
from South River, N.J. (St. Peter's
High School), averaged 14 ppg
and 15 rpg during her junior sea-
son last year. Ransom is an excel-
lent athlete and a very aggressive
rebounder.

”Turia is very similar to [Pitt for-
ward] Lorri Johnson,” said Bruce.
”She’s not that tall for an inside
player, but she is very strong in-
side and is an excellent offensive
rebounder.”

Ueberroth and Aaron
sharply disagree on
black representation

By Ben Walker

AP Baseball Writer

ATLANTA —— Mike Schmidt
and the Philadelphia Phillies tried
again to reach agreement, while
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth
and Hank Aaron sharply dis-
agreed Monday at baseball's win-
ter meetings.

A minor trade between the
New York Yankees and Texas
Rangers, a lot of speculation
about Bruce Hurst and Dale Mur-
phy and more talk about players
going to Japan kept the day lively.

The biggest spark came when
Aaron disputed Ueberroth’s as-
sertion of increased minority op-
portunities, saying it was ”the
same old bull, just dressed up a
little. ’

”There has been progress, but
not enough in the front office and
management level,’’ said Aaron,
executive vice president of the
Atlanta Braves.

”There are more minorities be-
ing interviewed, but I don't see
them getting the jobs. Joe Mor-

Thrift turned down jobs while with Pirates

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

ATLANTA — Former General
Manager Syd Thrift, fired by the
Pittsburgh Pirates after major dis-
agreements with ownership, said
Monday he wouldn’t have turned
down a lucrative five—year offer
from another team if he had
known he might lose his job.

Thrift, ousted in October after
a falling-out with Pirates Presi-
dent Carl Barger, said he still ”has
a whole lot of baseball left in
me.” He said he hopes to be con-
tacted by a club owner who is
”getting tired of losing.”

Thrift said he was offered
another general manager's job at
”five times what I was making in
Pittsburgh” last year, but reject-
ed the offer because he hadn’t
fulfilled his promise of rebuilding
the Pirates into a. contender.

Thrift, whose salary was boost-

led from $125,000 in 1987 to

$250,000 this year, would not
name the team that made the
offer. Major league teams that
have changed general managers
in the past two seasons include
the Chicago Cubs and White Sox,
Cincinnati, Seattle, Philadelphia

(twice), New York Yankees
(twice), Montreal and Los
‘ O Angeles.

Barger said Thrift ignored
repeated warnings to follow an
established chain of command
and continued to act on his own
without consulting with the
team's owners. The Pirates are
owned by a private—public con-
sortium of corporations and in-

dividuals.

Board Chairman Douglas Dan-
forth said Thrift ran the team as
if he owned it and spent too
much time on self—promotion at
the expense of others in the or-
ganization.

”Danforth told me I might have
worked at it too hard,” Thrift said.
”Maybe I did. I had such total
concentration on what I was do-
ing, trying to save the Pittsburgh
franchise, that I didn't see all the
other things.

’’I had a total commitment to
one thing, which is why I worked
16- to 18-hour days, sometimes
seven days a week,” Thrift said.
”When I first took the job [in
November 1985], I lived in fear
every day for it [the franchise] to
be moved.”

Through trades and a quick
retooling of the farm system,
Thrift turned the Pirates from
laughable 104—game losers in
1985 to a money—making pen-
nant contender in 1988. He was
fired, however, after the team's
second front—office power strug-
gle in as many seasons.

Thrift is confident others in
baseball have not lost their
respect for what he accomplished
in Pittsburgh and that he will get
the chance to run another team.

”Yes, definitely,” Thrift said
when asked if he expects to be
offered another front—office job.

’’I hope someone in baseball
who is -not satisfied with losing
will call on me,” he said.’”I ab-
solutely know I have another
rebuilding job left in me.

”This [firing] hasn't soured me

on baseball. It's still the greatest
game in the world. I'm not going
to let a couple of people sour me
on the sport I was born and raised
in and was talented in.”

Thrift refused to criticize Barg-
er or Danforth but said, ”This
wouldn't have happened with a
team whose owners had baseball
backgrounds.”

Thrift has received a $200,000
advance to write a book about his
Pittsburgh experiences. He also
will earn the $250,000 the Pirates
owe him on the second year of
his two-year contract. ‘

”But the Pirates are smart, they

don't have to pay me if I take a
job with another team,” he said.

Thrift, who is attending base-
ball's annual winter meetings,
also said:

0 He expects a Pirates’ owner-
ship change in the next several
years, when the current owners
are unable to meet skyrocketing
player salary increases. He said
new owners will buy the team or
the current consortium will add
additional partners. V

0 Jim Thrift was fired as
manager of the Pirates’ Princeton
(W.Va.) farm team not because
he didn’t do a good job, but be-

cause he was Thrift’s son. Thrift
tentatively had planned to pro-
mote his son to manager of the
Pirates’ Class A Augusta (Ca.)
farm club next season.

0 His firing makes sense ”only
in the eyes of the people who
want it to make sense.  But the
people in baseball know the job
we accomplished. You can't fool
your own peers.”

 they're all qualified and
deserve more than just an in-
terview."

Ueberroth opened the major
league portion of the meetings
with his fifth and final "State of
the Game" address.

Ueberroth, who will be suc-
ceeded by Bart Giamatti on April
1, said minority hiring had risen
from 2 percent to 10 percent in
two years but admitted he was
disappointed there weren't more
minority managers, general
managers and team public rela-
tions employees.

The commissioner said the
criticism that many of the new
minority workers were working
in clerical jobs "is a falsehood.”

But Aaron and Bob Watson, a
black recently hired as assistant
general manager of the Houston
Astros, disputed‘ that.

"lt's not a falsehood,” Aaron
insisted. "Most of those jobs are
in the ticket department, and

- that's about it.”

Watson said the minority em-
ployees "are mostly window

dressing.”

Schmidt and the Phillies spent
the day trying to agree on a new
contract. They have until Wed-
nesday to settle, or Schmidt can-
not play for the team until May.

They were close to a one-year
contract Sunday night — the Phil-
lies even passed out a press
release announcing the agree-
ment — before they had trouble
with terms in case of an injury.

The Phillies offered a $1.5 mil-
lion contract, with $500,000
guaranteed. With bonuses,
Schmidt could earn more than $2
million.

Hurst's situation remained in
limbo. The San Diego Padres are
said to be the favorites to get the
free—agent pitcher, although
Boston is expected to bid hard to
re-sign him.

''I don't know when he's going
to make a decision,” Padres
general manager Jack M_cKeon
said. "We're looking for a pitch-
er, and he could be the one. But
_if not, I'll get someone else.”

The Yankees and Rangers ex-

changed utility players. Texas
sent outfielder Bob Brower, who
batted .224 in 82 games, to New

York for infielder Bobby
Meacham, who hit .271 in 77
games.

There was much talk about
possible trades. Murphy interest-
ed several teams, and Houston
and San Diego joined the New
York Mets as the latest clubs to
call the Braves to arrange meet-
ings. The Yankees also wanted to
talk to Atlanta, probably about
shortstops Jeff Blauser and Andres
Thomas.

Some other players could be
going to Japan. Franklin Stubbs,
who has lost his first base to Ed-
die Murray in Los Angeles, might
consider going to Japan. Cecil
Fielder, who hit .230 in 74 games
with Toronto, and Boston farm-
hand Pat Dodson may be close to
signing foreign contracts, and
there was a rumor that Bob Horn-
er might be looking to return to
the Yakult Swallows. But former
major leaguer Leon Lee, who
helps the Swallows acquire
American players, denied Yakult
was pursuing Horner.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, December 6, 1988

Noll happy after team's

big win in Astrodome

(AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers
have won only four times in 14
tries, but Coach Chuck Noll said
Monday that his team's last-
minute 37-34 win over the Oil-
ers in Houston was particularly
sweet.

"[Houston] is a team that looks
like it's heading for the playoffs,
and we would like to shut that
off," Noll said. "The fact that we
had a lot of guys in a 'wil|—not—be-
denied’ attitude makes it an ex-
ceptional win.”

The Steelers saw Houston put
together an 80-yard drive to take
a 34-30 lead with 1:30 left, but
the Steelers came back with their
own 80-yard drive which culmi-
nated when Merril Hoge caught
a 16-yard touchdown pass from
Bubby Brister.

It was the Steelers’ first road-
game win this season. Their
home victories have come
against less formidable op-
ponents. A

The Steelers beat the 2-12 Dal-
las Cowboys in the opener,

defeated the 7-7 Denver Broncos
while quarterback John Elway
was out with an injury and
downed the 4-9-1 Kansas City
Chiefs two weeks ago.

"This obviously was a good
win for us," Noll said. "We had
guys who hung in there in very
much of a see—saw battle and
made things happen. The last
drive was a big one. The final
play where Merril wouldn't be
tackled kind of reflects the whole
thing.”

The Steelers also ended
Houston's 10-game Astrodome
winning streak. The rivalry be-
tween the Steelers and Oilers has
become intense over the past few
seasons, particularly after Noll ac-
cused the Oilers of taking cheap
shots.

During a postgame handshake
last season, Noll angrily lectured
Oilers coach Jerry Glanville
about Houston's aggressive tac-
tics. Oilers players nicknamed
the Astrodome "The House of
Pain," but the Steelers held their
own in that department against
Houston.

"We've been a physical team
all year, much more than we
have been in the past few years,”
Noll said. "I think physically
we're able to stand up with any-
body. They want to be a physi-
cal football team and so do we.”

At times, they were too physi-
cal. Steelers linebacker Greg
Lloyd was given a 15-yard per-
sonal foul penalty for hitting quar-
terback Warren Moon out of
bounds, which aided the Oilers
go-ahead drive. «

"The NFL is calling anything,
including bad breath, when it's
out of bounds," Noll said. "The
quarterback was retreating. It
wasn't much of a hit, but they're
going to call anything."

After eschewing the handshake
following the Oct. 16 game in
Pittsburgh, Noll and Glanville
met at the center of the field Sun-
day. Their contact was minimal
and mostly initiated by Glanville.
On Monday, Noll smiled at, but
did not answer, two questions
about their obviously strained
relationship.

The Steelers play at San Diego
this Sunday and finish the season
at home the following week
against Miami. Even though»form-
er Steeler Mark Malone is quar-
terbacking the Chargers, Noll
said Pittsburgh won't have to
change its scheme.

"They might know what we
do, but they don't know when it's
coming," he said. ”We delight in
someone knowing it because
those are people you can
mislead.”

The Steelers can still finish no

better than 6-10, but Noll thinks 1

their current two-game winning
streak is significant.

"It offers something for the fu-
ture,” he said. "We've got a
bunch of guys who are beginning
to believe and that's important.

"Every year is a new year, but
the individual takes something
with him, something [he's]
learned. That's the carryover
you're looking for."

NCR SAIIJTES:
THE WINNERS OF THE

ESSAY COMPETITION

“Progressive companies have begun
to think beyond the traditional
relationship of the ﬁrm to society
and have begun to manage all of
the relationships upon which they
depend for survival. Firms that
don’t follow suit may regret their
short-sightedness.”

Murray B. Low, Winner
NCR Stakeholder Essay
Competition

.» Some of today’s most important ideas are
held in trust by the leaders of tomorrow.

More than 2,500 such leaders, college
students from all over the country, recently
competed in an N CR—sponsored essay
competition. The topic: “Creating Value
For Stakeholders In Corporations

And/ Or Not-For—Proﬁt Organizations.”
At stake: $300,000 in awards. And at
even greater stake: a chance to affect the
way the world does business.

NCR is proud to salute the ﬁrst prize
winner; Murray B. Low of The Wharton
School, The University of Pennsylvania,‘
and the second prize winner; Ron Gilbert
of The University of Iowa. NCR also
congratulates the 98 national and state
award winners, as well as their schools.
Their names are listed below.

Our sincere thanks to all who entered the

future—for themselves, and for business
the world over
