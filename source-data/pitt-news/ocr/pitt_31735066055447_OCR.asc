In an effort to increase academic
standards, Pitt has eliminated its summer
preparation program for incoming fresh-
men who aren’t proﬁcient in math and

 English, and it will instead recruit stu-
 dents with higher SAT scores and grade
 point averages.

The Summer Transitional Education
Program was a special summer program
intended to give borderline applicants a
chance to continue their studies at Pitt’s

1 Oakland campus.

But this summer was the program’s

 last.

James Maher, provost and senior

f vice chancellor, said Pitt had to make a
 decision whether to turn away better-
is qualiﬁed applicants or to eliminate the
 STEP program and use its funding in
 other ways.

Now, students who would have been

Pitt nixes program for unp

accepted at Pitt’s Oakland in the STEP
program will be offered admission to the
branch campuses —, Bradford,
Greensburg, Johnstown, or Titusville.

Applicants who are notaccepted at a
branch campus may have to enroll in
community college and then transfer to
Pitt in a later year if their grades are good
enough.

The money that would have been
used for the STEP program will now go

toward scholarships for more qualiﬁed A

students, said Maher.

“The key element in making this
decision was that we were not prepared
to refuse admission to better—qualiﬁed
students,” he said.

Lora Shapiro, the program’s director
from 1993 to 1998, said the STEP pro-
gram was a wonderful opportunity for
students who were in the borderline cate-

Rarely does an issue come along
in Congress where voting actually
affects life and death. But in the $500
billion budget bill passed on Tuesday,
Congress had the ability to do just
that.

When the House of
Representatives approved the budget
bill for fiscal year 1999, a rider under
the Health and Human Services sec-
tion, on behalf of Rep. Bob Livingston
of Louisiana, stipulated that no change
could be made on the regional distrib-
ution of donated organs.

Livingston once again fended off

Chancellor offered chance
ofsecond $30,000 bonus

Erin Llndeman

Senior Staff Writer

Pitt trustees approved current-
year salaries for the University’s
top-ranking administrators
Wednesday, and like last year,
included provisions for a possible

$30,000 bonus for Chancellor Mark '

Nordenberg.
The trustees set Nordenberg’s
annual base salary at $250,000 and
gave him a bonus of $30,000 for
meeting predefined goals set for the
1997-1998 academic year.

The board’s Compensation
Committee also voted to provide
the chancellor with a similar incen-
tive for the 1998-99 academic year
if he achieves his
goals for this
year. T h e
amount of the
incentive, if
awarded, will be
determined by the
Compensation
Committee at a

Despite the chancellor’s raise,
Nordenberg continues to be one of
the lowest paid among the chancel-
lors and presidents of major
Pennsylvania universities.

In comparison, Duquesne
President John E. Murray receives
an annual salary of $371,833.
Carnegie Mellon University failed
to state the annual salary of its pres-
ident.

Throughout the meeting, board
Chair J.W. Connolly praised
Nordenberg and his management
team.

many years ago is leadership,”
Connolly said. “Chancellor
Nordenberg and his management
team are moving Pitt forward with
hard work, creative thinking and a
real sense of institutional commit-
ment.”

In response, Nordenberg said
that “each and every one of the offi-
cers’ work has contributed substan-
tially to the University.”

The Compensation Committee
approved salaries of other
University officers, based on rec-
ommendations from the chancellor:

tive vice chancellor, $200,000;

ance, a maximum of $5,000 per
year for health-care expenses, up to
$1,500 per year for financial coun-
seling, and the initiation fees and
monthly dues for one social or ath-
letic club.

The chancellor will receive
additional benefits, including a dri-
ver, membership in the Duquesne
Club, a University-provided resi;
dence, and expenses of relocating
family and household goods to the
University residence. These bene-
fits are unchanged from last year.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (U -WIRE) —
Students actually may be able to tell their
friends just how drunk they really were the
night before, thanks to a new device called
Control BAC.

Control BAC is a pocket-sized, comput-
er that estimates a person’s blood alcohol
concentration. Inventor Stephen Fults, pres-
ident of Stedebani Enterprise Company lnc.,
said the computer calculates BAC by con-
sidering several factors: weight, gender, vol-
ume and type of alcohol consumed, and
desired BAC.

When users consume an alcoholic bev-
erage, they press all t:hree buttons on the
device, and the computer records the drink.

Then it will tell the users how long to
wait before the next drink and will calculate
the BAC level. A _

Control BAC will be distributed to
Penn State students this week in celebration
of National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness
Week. Besides free Control BACs, many
other activities are planned at Penn State,
especially in dorms.

Marce Pancio, Residence Life coordi-
nator, said a Ribbon Campaign is planned
until Friday at various dining commons.

In the commons, students can sign a

sponsored by the State College Police
Departrnent will show students what it’s like
to drive drunk by having them wear “beer
goggles”  to distort their vision.

Fults explained why Control BAC is
the best device on the market for people
who want to monitor their alcohol con-
sumption.

“'Ihe [Pemrsylvania Liquor Control
Board] chart has a nice intent, but it’s not
practical. There is no reference to how intox-
icated you really are,” Fults said

Judy Albin, assistant director of
Residence Life, said devices such as the
Control BAC can be beneﬁcial but are often
misused

“If students use them the way they are
intended, to protect themselves from over-
drinking, then it is a good thing,” Albin said
“But there are many [preventive] things at
ourdisposalthataremisused—tlrisisno
exception.”

Fults said Control BAC is unlike any-
thing else on the market to aid students’
alcohol awareness.

“This device will tell you how long to
wait before yo1n° next drink,” Fults said “It’s
amazing how accurate it is.”

Fraudulent e—mail fools students

Jamie L. Nielsen

The State News

EAST LANSING, Mich. (U-WIRE)
—Abogus e—mail sent to approximately 900
Michigan State students Saturday instructed
them to disclose conﬁdential information
about their Pilot e—mail accounts.

The e—mail, sent from an America

Online account, requests that students pro- '

vide their Pilot login and conesponding
password in order to prevent being discon-
nected from the Pilot system. The message
warns that if students don’t comply, it “could
result in not being able to retrieve your Pilot
e—mail  or not being able to login at all.”

Lewis Greenberg, director of the
Computer Laboratory, advises students to be
aware of the dangers of disclosing this infor-
mation to anyone.

“No matter what, you should never give
out your password That information should
always be secure,” he said. “If someone gets
a hold of that, they can easily gain access to
a lot of your personal infonnation.”

The e—mail claims to be sent ﬁom a
Pilot system administrator named Ruth
Gradner. There is no MSU employee with
that name, Greenberg said

No matches were found when “Ruth
Gradner” was entered in a Pilot directory
search. Also, a search for infonnation about
the e—mail sender via America Online came
UP emPW-

Greenberg formd out about the e—mail

when he received a copy of the message
from a concerned student.

“Someone sent a copy to [the Computer
Laboratory] because they didn’t know if was
true or not,” he said “That wastheﬁrsttirne
I heard about it.”

While e—mail fraud isn’t a regular occur-
rence on campus, similar situations have
arisen in the past.

‘This doesn’t happen often, but it hap-
pened several years ago,” Greenberg said
“We don’t know where [the current e—mail]
came from though. It could be from on cam-
pus or from New York. We can’t speculate.”

Paul Hunt, vice provost for libraries,
computing and technology, said that MSU
has taken action by contacting America
Online.

“Incaseslikethis,usuallytheserveris
contacted before the
authorities get involved,” he said. “MSU has
alreadytakentheﬁrststepintryingtoﬁgure
out who sent the e—mail.”

Jessica See, a journalism junior and
employee of the Computer Information
Center, said the center received a large num-
ber of questions from students who were
worried by the e—mail.

“We tell everyone not to reply to the e-
mail, but we’re afraid that some people
might have already done it,” she said
“When someone replies to it, a message
comes back saying the address is unknown.
That probably means that whoever sent it
canceled their account already.”

ORGANS

Center, Sen. Rick Santorum, and
Pennsylvania Rep. William Coyne.

Livingston could not be reached
for comment, but a spokesman in his
office believed that Livingston was
opposed to need—based allocation
because it would be unfair to the
smaller states, particularly his home
state of Louisiana.

It should be the right of the donor
or his family-to decide to whom and
how the organ should be donated, the
spokesman said.

Now, organs are distributed
regionally instead of according to
patient need status. That was supposed
to change because of the efforts of
HHS back in April.

UPMC spokeswoman Lisa Rossi
said, “Bob Livingston is single—hand—
edly responsible for this delay, and this
isn’t the first time he’s done this.”

The stipulation that Livingston
added was perhaps overlooked
because of the last—minute rush to
approve the budget bill so lawmakers
could go home to campaign for the
Nov. 3 election. Also, the 40—pound,
nearly 4,000—page copies of the bill
were not distributed until less than four
hours before Tuesday night’s vote.

Matt Dinkel, Coyne’s press secre-
tary, said the budget bill is ordinarily
“exclusively spending bills,” and that
was another reason this issue was not
thoroughly brought to the attention of

many representatives.

In April, ,_HHS wrote a provision
stating that organs should be distrib-
uted on the basis of need and not by
region, but that could not take effect
until Oct. 1.

Now it can’t go into effect until at
least January, when
the newly elected

Congress recon-
venes. But even
then, unless

Congress proposes
a separate bill in
January, the issue
will more than like-
ly not be raised
until the budget is
an issue again.

Dinkel noted
that because of this,
any change will be
delayed for a year.

“During the
year of delay
caused by this rider,
over 200 people
who could have
been saved will die waiting for trans-
plants,” Coyne said. “Certain appropri-
ators chose to ignore these facts about
organ transplants and block a regula-
tion which would have had saved hun-
dreds of lives. I strongly oppose their
decision.”

Toraynham, said Santorum agrees with
Coyne that the sickest person should
receive priority as an organ recipient.

“Needless lives are wasted that
way. It’s just common sense,”
Toraynham said.

In a June 30 press release,
Santorum said,
“Very few federal
policies truly control
the life and death of
American citizens as
the organ allocation
process does. I
believe that human
organs are too pre-
cious and scarce a
resource to be allo-
cated by a private
contractor without
government over-
sight of the policy.”

Rossi said
UPMC officials feel
they have the data to
back up the claim
that more people are
dying sooner
because of this. But the Institute of
Medicine, which is funded by
Congress, will soon conduct a study of
its own.

“In our [UPMC’s] opinion, they
are just going to find out what we
already know to be true —— that the sys-
tem is not fair,” Rossi said.

‘I'm. Prrr Naws

STEP

“I’ve spent many a long day with
students who have the potential to be
University of Pittsburgh students,”
Shapiro said. “And I feel incredibly sad-
dened that a wonderful opportunity has
been lost.” ‘

Shapiro noted that students select the
Oakland campus over branch campuses
for numerous reasons, including its loca-
tion and academics. V

“[Spending] the seven weeks here
during the summer speaks to their com-
mitment and desire for this campus,” she
said.

She also explained the main reason
for the program — to create a transition-
al experience for students. Shapiro
emphasized that STEP was not a special-
needs program. The students came from
all educational backgrounds, from gener-
al math courses to Advanced Placement
English and calculus.

Shapiro said the focus of the pro-
gram was to teach students the transitions
and rigors of college.

“Over time, [STEP] students tend to
get more involved institutionally, and
they feel they have to give back to the
University,” she said. ,

Shapiro said she was speaking on
behalf of the students who had success-
fully endured the STEP program.

Pitt, along with numerous other col-
leges and universities across the nation,
has begun to reject or send to satellite

Tola Ro

campuses students who would have been
accepted at the main campus only a few
years ago.

According to Betsy Porter, director
of admissions and financial aid, last
year’s freshman class had an average
SAT score of 1158,

met. Despite her two-page typed list of
extracurricular activities that included
representing her student government
regionally, statewide, and nationally; four
awards; and a list of recommendations,

ter. Instead, she was

In the STEP program, the students

they agreed to complete the seven—week
program the summer before their fresh-
man year. The students lived in the
Towers dormitories and took writing and
math courses in theprogram.

Even though
Mignogna was only
accepted through the
STEP program, she managed to finish the
seven weeks with a 3.9 GPA. She is now
president of Tower A and part of the
Resident Student Association Executive
Board.

“Without the STEP program, I
wouldn’t be at this college,” Mignogna
said. “And I wouldn’t have had all of
these wonderful opportunities.”

Mignogna said that during the pro-

FROM PAGE 1

gram, the students took three classes:
math, English and Freshman Orientation.
They were also required to meet with
peer counselors once a week and to meet
frequently with advisers.

“Because the classes were so small,
we got to know the professors on a per-
sonal basis, and they knew us well,’’ she
said.

Mignogna also stated her concern for
future students because there will be no
STEP program.

“People in STEP stay friends
throughout college. It is a little like high
school because everyone was there for
the same reason, and everyone really
helped each other,” she said.

The STEP program involved social-
izing as well as academics, Mignogna
said. She said the students went to
Kennywood and took trips to the movies
and malls with their professors and advis-
ers, which added to the close relation-
ships.

“The ﬁrst week everyone was mad
that we had to be there but by the time we
left we were all glad we were told to
come,” she said.

Mignogna also said that eliminating
the STEP program was one of the worst
things that Pitt could have done.

“[Penn State] has a summer program
[like STEP], and I feel that a lot of stu-
dents will end up going to PSU instead of
Pitt because of this,” Mignogna said.

Chancellor Nordenberg

deserves his raise and bonus

If you can convince an editor-
ial board comprised of cynical
aspiring journalists that you
deserve a 7.8-percent raise and a
$30,000 bonus, you must be doing
a good job.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
deserves the raise and bonus given
to him by the Compensation
Committee of Pitt’s board of
trustees.

Last year’s Pitt News Editorial
Board objected to his raise last
October on the grounds that
departmental budgets had been
cut, maintenance workers had
been snubbed, and professors
were being retired and not
replaced.

V Though these are still valid
concerns that should be addressed,
Nordenberg has fulﬁlled his job
description and more. Board Chair
J. W. Connolly said that
“Nordenberg and his management
team are moving Pitt forward with
hard work, creative thinking and a
real sense of institutional commit-
merit.”

Under Nordenberg’s brief
chancellorship, Pitt has bloomed.
It is faring better in the academic
rankings (there has been a large
increase in the number of appli-
cants and an increase in the quali-
ty of each incoming freshman

class, judging by their SAT
scores), the athletics department is
moving forward thanks to
Nordenberg’s hiring of Athletics
Director Steve Pederson (who has
done a great job promoting Pitt’s
sports teams, and the Pitt football
team made its ﬁrst bowl appear-
ance since 1989), housing issues
are being addressed, and Pitt is
ﬁnally getting a much-needed
convocation center and dorms.
There will be an armounce-
ment today of an eight—f1gure
donation to the University, which
Nordenberg is responsible for
gleaning. Nordenberg also man-

aged to pull $138 million from the .

state to use for building projects.
The chancellor has been
instrumental in getting intemation-
al recognition for the University.
He accompanied Gov. Tom Ridge
to Israel during the summer; he
invited Ghanian President Jerry
Jon Rawlings to Pitt along with
other international dignitaries.
Nordenberg has put in more
than 110 percent; he was seen
working in his office at 2:30 a.m.
the Sunday after the football game
against Penn State. For a man who

‘puts so much time and effort into

the job of chief executive officer
of this university, he deserves his
raise.

If Fifth Avenue narrws, drivers will adapt

Have you ever wondered if Bigelow
Boulevard should be closed, if the Mon Valley
Expressway should be built, or if Fifth Avenue
should be narrowed?

Answers to these questions usually come
from two sources: (1) transportation experts
with PhD.s, who talk in an obscure, hard to
understand language (unless you are one of
them) and rim their studies from air-conditioned
oﬂices using computer models and (2) People
who have virtually no understanding of trans-
portation planning but give you “expert” opin-
ions anyway.

Both groups then arrive at a variety of con-
tradicting conclusions, often far away from real-
ity. But even having objective, unbiased irrfor—
mation doesn’t help. It’s like the abortion issue:
No matter which way you decide, there will
always be people complaining about it.

The underlying principles of transportation
planning are, however, very simple and can be
understood by anybody. There
are only two rriajor principles:
The equilibrium law and the
resistance to change law.

The equilibrium law:
Unless you live in a one—horse
town, a transportation system is a complex,
chaotic organism. When a change is made to the
system, the system eventually adapts to that
change until a new equilibrium is reached. For
example, a major road is closed for repair. The
traffic doesn’t stop: It ﬁnds its way through other
roads. Soon, it ﬂows smoothly as if the road had
never been built

The resistance to change law: People are
naturally resistant to change: For example, we
keep our credit cards and Columbia House
memberships long after the initial low interest

"rates or free CDs are gone. When a road closes,

people stick to their old routes for a while. When
the inconvenience of traﬂic jams bothers them
enough, they ﬁnd new ways to get around
These two laws always balance each other,
aridtheyapplytootherareasaswell.Whenyou
break up with your signiﬁcant other, you are
bothered by the change, and you suddenly have
plenty of time to be sad Eventually, you adapt to
the change: You take that class you always
wantedtotake, andyouarehappierthanever.

‘denly see trafﬁc jams and people complaining

all over the place, some even pointing their ﬁn-
gerstothe sky. Forthose ofyou who werehere
during the week-long test closure in 1996, that
was the case. Initial complaints and disturbances
to the usual ﬂow are inevitable. But wait a cou-
ple of months or a year, and you will see a dif-
ferent pattern. The traﬂic will be ﬂowing
smoothly through the surrounding streets, and
the students will no longer be endangered by
impatient, speeding drivers — at least on that
one street.

Of course, there will be people who will
suffer from the change. Some vendors will lose
their businesses, and some drivers will lose their
parking. This is also inevitable. What matters,
however, is what the impact will be after every-
thing settles down and the beneﬁts (or gains) are
compared to costs (or losses).

\V1th this in mind, let’s look at the proposed
“narrowing down” or the sidewalk expansion on
Fifth Avenue. Inevitably, there
will be traﬂic jams and all that
goes with it‘ in the initial change.
This will be, however, only for a
short transitional period. When
things settle down, chances are
there will be fewer cars on the road and possibly
more pedestrians on the sidewalk on that section
of Fifth Avenue. Pedestrians are the ones who
beneﬁt because the sidewalks will get less
crowded, there will be less noise and pollution,
and there will be less chance that somebody will
be forced from a crowded sidewalk under a bus.

The “inconvenienced” group will be the
drivers going to or from Oakland or just passing
through. Some of the drivers passing through
will switch to a different route or give up their
trips altogether; some of the drivers going to
Oakland will choose a different mode of trans-
portation, such as walking, bicycling, carpooling
or taking a bus.

From the viewpoint of society, all these are
desirable consequences. We all suﬁ°er from four
major transportation related problems: emis-
sions of hazardous and toxic gases, greenhouse-
gas emissions, dependence on imported petrole-
um and congestion Reducing the number of sin-
gle-occupancy vehicles on the road not only
helps solve all four problems at once, but also

One game
not a season
make or break

Nobody believes anymore.

After Pitt’s Homecoming loss to
Rutgers, football fans disappeared The sea-
son ended faster than a typical Kordell
Stewart-led Steelers series.

Belief vanished.

This isn’t an unusual phenomenon;
fans give up on teams halfway through the
season all the time.

But if history serves, the fans should
know better.

Last October, a few brave souls
watched what we thought was the downfall
of civilization — the Panthers, 3-1 at the
time, were soundly thumped at Veterans
Stadium by the mighty Temple Owls.

Temple dominated the contest. The
Panthers didn’t even belong on the ﬁeld
Kevin Harvey’s scrambling ability and a
suddenly tenacious Owl defense had an
overconﬁdent Pitt team in shock.

The loss didn’t just hurt Pitt’s chances
at a bowl game — it maimed them. VV1th a
loss to the resident Big East doormat
already on the stat sheet, Harris’ team need-
ed to upset at least one of the league’s ﬁnest
programs to earn a trip to postseason play.

It was a horrible ride home —- ﬁve
hours in tumpike traffic, lamenting the loss
of Pitt’s Homecoming momentum and
whining about our lost hopes of a trip to
Memphis.

No one believed. Of course, this was
before we got the stickers that told us to
believe, so we had an excuse.

Everybody knows what happened
next: a few more disappointing losses, two
ﬂat-out unbelievable wins at the end of the
season, and the bowl trip that lived up to all
party-related expectations  even» if the
game was slightly painful.

Still, it happened Despite an early—sea—
son loss to one of the worst teams in
Division I, it happened; the Panthers
reached the promised land of postseason
play. 5

Now fast-forward a year. Impressive
showings against Penn State and Akron,
combined with a win against Vrllanova that
was a tad less than impressive, serve as
bright spots for a 2-3 team.

Road losses to Virginia Tech and North
Carolina are taken at face value — games
that the Panthers were expected to lose.
Upset heroics, like in all good suspense
novels, should come near the end

Men's soccer downs Canisius, 3-l

Jim Grief
Staff Wrlter

It was cold. It was raining that
“Scottish mist” rain. In fact, everything
was miserable about last night, except the
play of the Panther men’s soccer team as
it drowned Canisius, 3-1.

The win improved Pitt’s record to 6-
6-3 and, more importantly, give the team
momentum heading into the end of the
season.

Pitt’s ﬁrst major scoring opportunity
came at the 19:35 mark with Spencer
Barton ﬁring the ball at the net, but
Canisius goalkeeper John Ford saved his
team with a stellar diving catch.

Canisius then put together its best
offensive efforts of the day as Pitt goal-
keeper Chris Hanlon had to make several
saves later in the ﬁrst half.

The strong goalkeeping allowed Pitt
to score first as Travis Kruse put one past
Ford at 41:08 forthe Panthers’ ﬁrst goal
and Kruse’s. second of the season.

Canisius then began to pin Pitt deep
in its own territory and was able to con-
vert off a Tony Merrmgas pass to defend-
er Nate Fillmore with 10 seconds left in
the half. The score was a misleading 1-1

tie after 45 minutes.

The second half was a different story,
as Pitt ran out of the locker room deter-
mined to continue the offensive pressure.
Just three minutes into the second half,

He Said

 

Pitt scored again. This time, Chad Porter
knocked one into the net off a pass from
Jeff Dyer, who recorded ﬁrst points of the
year.

While this goal would prove to be the
game-winner, Porter was notfrnished. He
assisted on a Drew Kopp goal to move
into second on the team’s scoring list with
11 points.

. Pitt dominated Canisius with 29 shots
and 10 comer kicks.‘

“We worked the ball well,” said head
coach Joe Luxbacher, who was happy
with the -tearn’s first win in more than a
month. I

“We played ﬁve ranked teams in a
row,” he said, explaining the team’s
seven-garne winless streak. “The story of
our season is not ﬁnishing, but we did a
good job of that tonight.”

Luxbacher, who was concerned

about sloppy play toward the end of the
game, did praise the team for the win.

“It was a workman-like game.  I
didn’t know what to expect from
[Canisius],” he said. The Grifﬁns beat
Duquesne, a team Pitt tied earlier in the
season.

Pitt still has an outside chance at
making the Big East tournament, despite
at 1-5-2 record in the conference. It will
have to beat St. John’s and Syracuse and
get some help from the Big East basement
dwellers to make the eight-tearn cut..

Last year, Chad Porter decided he
didn’t want to follow in his brother
J eff ’s footsteps and play soccer at Pitt.

Instead, he started his collegiate
career at James Madison University. In
his year there, he was introduced to a
stressful brand of soccer, and he played
with a team on which it was tough to
communicate.

“There wasn’t good team chem-
istry,” he said. “The coach was extra
demanding. I was really stressed out
about soccer.”

After a year at JMU, he transferred
to Pitt to play for the program coach Joe
Luxbacher recruited him for when
Porter was in high school.

“Chad is one of the more experi-
enced players on our team,” Luxbacher
said.

Recently, the team has missed that
experience because Porter dislocated his
shoulder at Rutgers in late September.
Until his return to the lineup for last
Friday’s 3-3 tie, the Panthers had lost
ﬁve straight contests.

Porter, a sophomore midﬁelder,
helps carry the squad with his talent and

   
   

years of soccer experience.

His ﬁrst memories of the earliest
days of his soccer career came when he
was very young. At age four, Porter was
found in his ‘backyard in nearby Irwin,

contributed to his success in the sport.

Pa., playing ball with his three older

In his early days playing club soc-
cer, he proved just how talented he was
by being bumped up two age groups to
play on a team with his older brother.

Porter took his abilities to high
school at Penn—Trafford in the Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic
League, where he captured the All-
WPIAL, Al1—State and Regional All-
America honors in his sophomore,

‘ junior and senior years.

Not only did he carry his state-
ranked soccer team by becoming the all-
time leading goal scorer, in his sopho-
more and junior years, he donned a hel-
met and pads on Friday nights to kick
for the football team.

“Football practices were right after
school, and soccer didn’t start until the
evening,” he said. “It was pretty hectic.”

Porter’s hectic and successful high
school career led to his recruitment by
many college programs, including Pitt,
where his brother played from 1992-96.

After realizing the program at JMU
wasn’t for him, Porter came back to

Pitt, where he has found a home at the

Pitt hockey wins first game of the year at weekend tourney

Marlanne E. Graham

For The Pitt News

The Panther ice hockey team col-
lected its first win of the season and
a second-place finish at last week-
end’s Indiana University of
Pennsylvania Tournament.

Jake Polochak, Justin Grass and
Ross Stuart each had two goals, and
goaltender Patrick Kenny had 38
saves to help the Panthers to“a 7-6,
triple-overtime defeat of the
University of Maryland-Baltimore
County for its first win of the season.

The two teams matched each
other goal for goal throughout the
game. UMBC scored the first goal on
a power play halfway through the
first period.

Polochak answered less than two
minutes later with the first of his two
goals.

The back-and-forth nature of this
game continued until Pitt finally took
the lead with 50.7 seconds left in
regulation time on a goal by captain
Dave Fryer."

But with just 25.6 seconds left,
Kevin Armstrong’s second goal tied
the ‘game for UMBC and caused
overtime.

Both teams continued to get
chance after chance as they toiled
into the early-morning hours of

triple-overtime. Fryer had a goal dis-
allowed because he made a kicking
motion at the puck and knocked it
into the goal at the midpoint of the
second overtime, and freshman
Grass’ attempt hit the post at the
beginning of the third overtime.

The team had chance after
chance and break-
away after break-
away, and fresh-
man Ross Stuart
finally got the
game-winning
goal at 4:18 of the
third overtime.

The win
brought the feel-
ing of a “changing
of the tides,”
according to
Stuart.

“I think it’s
symbolic that. a
freshman got the
game-winning
goal,” said Stuart.

Pitt coach
Wade Chouinard
pointed out how differently the team
played compared to its loss to Penn
State two weeks ago.

“We really came together as a
team. Our guys began to mold
together not only on the ice, but on

‘Max! ‘nu 4 momomd uaoanum of the Ax.aocu.iion on Mum-:.u: Mmmml 

the bench, supporting each other,” he
said.

Chouinard feels that the team is
getting better with every game and
agrees that the freshmen are making
a big impact.

Senior

defenseman 1 Tony

He Said

team’s record last
year (1-17), many
of the players
began to think
they just couldn’t
win.

“We held
together a lot bet-
ter in this game
and really per-
formed well on
things we worked
on in practice. We
never gave up in
this game.”

The Panthers
then took their
new 1-1 record
into Saturday’s
championship
game with IUP,
which had beaten Slippery Rock, 19-
2, the previous day.

The game, an 11-1 loss for the
Panthers, was a departure from the
togetherness of Friday’s win.
Possibly from ‘lack of rest, the

Panther bench was quiet, and the
effect was evident on the ice.

The Panthers’ lone goal by Grass
came at 15:18 of the third period,
when the team was already down by
five goals.

Chouinard cited poor physical
conditioning and the triple-overtime
game with UMBC as reasons for the
difference in Pitt’s play.

“When you’re in a game like the
one with UMBC, you have to use
your bigger, more talented players to
get the win.”

Chouinard said that IUP was not
necessarily a better team than
UMBC.

“Talent-wise, they were better,
but they were undisciplined.”

lUP’s undisciplined nature
showed in its 17 penalties for 50
minutes in the game.

One huge improvement for the
Panthers in this game was their
penalty killing. The Panthers allowed
IUP only 2 power—play goals in 9
chances.

UMBC took third in the tourna-
ment with its 5-0 win over Slippery
Rock, which was 0-2 in the tourna-
ment and allowed 24 goals in only
two games.

Pitt now turns its attention to its
first home game of the season against
Duke on Nov. 7.

Knights contest seems like a coronation —
appropriate for a Homecoming matchup.
Pitt’s offense looks crisp, the defense lives
up to national publicity, and the freshmen
fans sit back, breathe in the fresh autumn air,
and say silent prayers thanking no deity in
particular that they picked a school with a
fun, successful football program

The king and the queen make their
appearance. The band plays an abbreviated
but impressive halftime show. KDKA-'I'V’s
John Steigerwald gives a score update from
the stands, thanking no deity in particular
that Pitt Stadiurn’s jumbo screen makes him
look taller than 4 feet 11 inches.

Everyone believes in the power of
Panther football. Had the Alumni
Association passed around a collection plate
before the start of the third quarter, most of
next year’s scholarships would be paid off.

Then Rutgers woke up.

First a ﬁeld goal drive. Then a long
touchdown march to put the game within
reach for the Knights.

Then Reggie Stephens reaches up and
snares a Matt Lytle pass, killing any
momentum that the team or the fans had left

Two plays later, Mike McMahon com-
pletes a 63-yard touchdown pass to give his
team (gasp!) the lead

The booing starts. The fourth quarter
yields nothing of consequence for either
squad.

The booing continues. Coach Walt
Harris may never have heard jeers such as

_ these in his tenure, but Johnny Majors and a

few writers with good memories are having

FROM PAGE 8

ﬂashbacks in the press box.

The game mercifully ends.

For many, the season ends with it.

Sure, nobody needed to take a long,
depressing drive back to campus after the
loss, but the lesson should still be pretty
clear — one game, no matter how gut-
wrenching, does not make a season worth-
less.

Teams with coaches like Harris and
leaders like Lytle (as long ashe gets over
this little interception problem he’s been
having) don’t let it make a season worthless.

The Panthers remain two major upsets
away from bowl consideration. It happened
last season at the very last moment, and it
could happen again this year.

It might even start next week. \V1th ‘ 14
days to plan, Harris could probably design
an offense to combat the 82nd Airborne.

Of course, nobody in his right mind
would predict something like that —— it
deﬁes logic, reason, and pretty much every-
thing else one might use to accurately pre-
dict football games.

It takes faith. —

To blatantly steal a line from former
Mets and Phillies pitcher Tug McGraw, “Ya
gotta believe.”

Kevin Lilley is the senior football writer for
The Pitt News and thinks Tug McGrawis
best line might have come when a reporter
asked him which he liked better —— grass or
artificial turf

“Dunno, ” he said. “I never smoked

mlf ))

PORTER

“There were a lot of factors,” he
said. “My brother had only good things
to say about the program, and it is com-
pletely different being in the city. There
are a lot of things to do. I like it here.”

Not only does Porter like his new
home, his coach feels he is a deﬁnite
asset to the team.

“Chad reads and understands the
game very well. He has more than just
physical ability,” Luxbacher said.
“There aren’t very many players with
that mix.”

Porter has scored three goals thus
far for the Panthers, his latest coming
during the Seton Hall game. A

He broke a ﬁve—game team scoring

FROM PAGE 8

drought, showing how much the team
missed his play.

“I shouldn’t take credit for it [end-
ing the streak]. The team played really
well as a whole,” Porter said. A

But despite his modesty, his coach
thinks Porter has been a large force on
the team.

“Chad is a, leader on the field,”
Luxbacher said.

Porter, a business management’
major, is happy with his soccer career at
Pitt. Though he didn’t think so original-
ly, it seems now that following his
brother’s footsteps was probably the
best thing he has done for his soccer
career.

Correction: Last week, The Pitt News reported that the
Rutgers football team has never won a Big East game. It
has won Big East games in the past.
