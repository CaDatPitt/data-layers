The Office of Financial Aid
at Pitt has not made any plans
to change the amount of finan-
cial assistance it provides to un-
dergraduate students, despite the
economic recession.

Student government board
candidates stood in the cold yes-
terday passing out yellow and
blue ﬂiers with platforms and
puzzles to remind students to
vote, a problem that plagued last
year’s SGB election.

Last year, SGB voting num-
bers slumped, with Sumter Link
receiving 1,794 votes in a one—on—
one race for the presidency, the
highest total number of votes for
any candidate —— including board
members — in the election.

Elections committee chair Pat-

rick Moroney said with roughly 

17,000 undergraduate students on
Pitt’s campus, last year’s numbers
werejdisappointing. This year, the
elections committee has tried to
“focus programming a bit more”
with events like “Dinner with the
Candidates” in Market Central
and the SGB presidential debate,
both geared toward encouraging
voter turnout.

“Before, we used to hand out
food like Five Guys and have stu-
dents meet the candidates in Tow-
ers Lobby,” he said. “But what
we found is that most students
would just pick a burger and run.

“I’m paying my education
myself, and the majority of the
money is coming from student

reduced, I’d just have to work
harder and find a way to pay for
it. It would be really tough and

Pa. sewage
referendum
to fix stink

by Brandon Ellis
Staﬁ’ Writer
After students across Oakland
participated in the noble demo-
cratic process on Election Day by
voting for president and state rep-
resentatives, they voted whether
they wanted the state to spend mil-

" lions to improve sewage infrastruc-

fL11”€.

Many students may recall the
referendum question on the ballet,
which asked voters whether they
thought the state of Pennsylvania
should issue $400 million in loans
and grants to statewide communi-
ties for sewage, drinking water and
storm water projects.

And if these same students
happened to be voting in South
Oakland, they might have gotten
a whiff of one of the reasons be-
hind this proposal, which voters
overwhelmingly supported.

Some parts of South Oakland
are notorious among students for
their stink of raw sewage, one
problem that Michael Kenney, ex-
ecutive director of the Pittsburgh
Water and Sewer Authority, hopes
the new state funding will help 10-
cal authorities to address.

Kenney said that the Pittsburgh

j Water, and Sewer Authority com-

bines its storm water system and
its sanitary system into one, which
means that the system often gets
overtaxed, resulting in such things
as sewage backup and its associ-
ated stink.

“We have a constant mainte-
nance problem that comes from
a combination system,” said Ken-
ney. A

HE explained that the storm
water system, which drains excess
precipitation from storms into riv-
ers, is the same one that transports
waste to rivers and sewage treat-
ment facilities. if

The new money from the ap-
proval of the referendum will now
allow the Authority to build the in-

Best On-Carnpus Job: Tele-
fund-

Whﬂe Pitt students need all
the money they can get, the best
on-campus job is one where we
beg those with the dough to‘ give
some back to the University.
Sure, it has enough cash already,
but that’s another point. Students
spend their hours calling alumni,
staff, faculty and parents to plead
for another monetary advance on
top of those tuition bills. But in
the end, we get the green. as well,
and that’s all that matters.

Best Bus Route: 59U

You want to get to the South
Side Works but can’t stand the
extra 10 minutes it takes to walk
from the 54C stop on East Car-
son Street to your destination.
And when the Cheesecake Facto-
ry, movie theater, McCormick and
Schrnick’s or any of the endless
variety of clothing stores awaits
you, why hesitate? Of course, it
seems like the 59U’ comes only
once every 60 hours, but if _you
time your stop just right, you
have easy access to agold mine

felt the tremors of the econom-
ic crisis when the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance
Agency, or PHEAA, announced
earlier in the year that out—of-
state students attending school
would no longer be eligible for
KeystoneBEST federal loans be-
cause of the ﬁnancial crunch.

PHEAA spokesperson Mike
Reib_er said that despite the lirni—
tation, Pennsylvania students are
still getting the money they need
for college.

“We haven’t heard of a single
qualiﬁed student being denied a
Stafford Loan in Pennsylvania,”
said Reiber. “The only problems
with student loans will be coming
out of the private sector, where

qualiﬁcations for loans will be-

come more restrictive in the light .

McColloch conﬁrmed that the
PHEAA restrictions have had no
impact on Pitt students.

His advice to students con-

cation is to look for money in

‘ ivery student’s situation is
different, but these free awards
severely reduce the amount of
debt students will be faced with
upon graduation,” said Reiber.
“It’s also essential to ﬁll out the
[Free Application for Federal
Student Aid] form to qualify for
federal student loans.”

Even if ﬁnancial aid awards
are not impacted by the econom-
ic crisis, students may still feel the
results of the recession.

Twenty percent of Pitt’s en-
dowment relies on successful in-

a previous story. The endowment
provides for scholarships and fel-

and other University business.

If the endowment does not
grow over the year, provisions
may have to be cut. Common ef-

Pitt spokespersonjohn Fedele
said that the University will not
comment on endowment losses
until a committee meeting is held
to determine the extent of reper-
cussions and damages.

“There are no shortages of
federal loans this year, and we are
not anticipating shortages next
year,” said Fedele. “We haven’t
heard anything to suggest other-

selors in Pittsburgh try to empha-
size the importance of grants and

‘scholarships early. In Pittsburgh,

eight out of the 10 public high

M’

schools receive Title I federal
funding. This funding is only pro-_
vided when 35 percent or more
of the student body comes from
a low—income family.

Grants and scholarships are
necessary to bolster funds for
high school students seeking sec-
ondary education.

At Langley High School, a Ti-
tle I school in the Pittsburgh area,
nearly two—thirds of the student
body goes on to attend a two— or
four-year college. The recently
implemented V Pittsburgh Prom-
ise, established by The Pittsburgh
Foundation, provides ﬁnancial
aid to students and families of
the Pittsburgh public schools for
higher education at two—year and
four-year colleges within Pennsyl-
vania.

Nevertheless, guidance coun-
selor Christopher Hertneky al-
ready sees problems with ﬁnan-
cial aid for his students.

According to Hertneky, ﬁnan-
cial aid has not adjusted to inﬂa-
tion, and scholarships simply do

not provide enough money.

“As a guidance counselor, I’ve
seen that the poorest of students,
no matter how much money they
receive from scholarships, are still
thousands of dollars short of
funding their college education,”
said Hertneky.

Low—income families often
cannot shoulder the ﬁnancial bur-
den of taking out private loans to
supplement federal aid.

“Our parents do not really

. have the ﬁnancial ability to with-

stand a reduction in aid,” said
Hertneky.

On the Pittsburgh campus
of the University, undergraduate
student ﬁnancial aid totaled more
than $154 million for the 2007-08
school year, said the Ofﬁce of Fi-

, nancial Aid.

Need—based scholarship and
grant assistance totaled at an av-
erage award of $57,265 per eligible
student.

Financial aid information for
the current school year is. not
available at this time.

Life is calling.

Moroney also said the elec-

Facebook group to remind peo-
ple to vote. C

“The Facebook group will be

he said. A
Pitt also decided to award
Outside the Classroom Curricu-
lum credit to students for voting
in the election, a tactic that One

encourage people _to vote.

‘ “It’ll deﬁnitely be interest-
ing to see how that aspect en-
hances the voting numbers,” she
said. “That credit, along with the
number of candidates, should
deﬁnitely boost the numbers of

   
  

 

people voting.”

' But Kevin Morrison, the pres-
idential candidate for One Vision
One Voice, disagreed and said
if the credit caused a few more
people to vote, it would be for the
wrongreasons. '

“I think the voter turnout will

be worse this year,” he said. “I.

think the credit will cause people
to just vote and not vote based on
the candidate’s issues. They’ll click
on the ﬁrst names they see instead

of focusing on the_issues. That, I
I along with the shorter amount of

time allowed for the paper cam-
paign, could cause problems with
turnout. It’s deﬁnitely going to be
a big wildcard.”

“But there’s been a lot of
exposure in the news lately, for
those students that don’t'know
anything about SGB or about
us,” he said. “So, hopefully, I’m
wrong.”

“The burden should really fall

Moroney. “But some people are

and now the state money will help
to fund th_e infrastructure irnprove-
ments that will allow the Authority
to send all its waste to sewage treat-
ment facilities instead of rivers.

Kenney said the moneywill also
go into improving drinking water
treatment facilities for the city and
improve the water treatment pro-
cess to meet the standards for the
Clean Water Act.

“This will be a really good kick-
start to the program of investing
into the future,” said Kenney.

He expressed hope that the
main city water treatment plant,
which delivers about 70 million
gallons of water per day, will soon
be able to deliver 100 gallons per
day because of new infrastructure
growth.

. The money will also help to
fund improvements to three res-
ervoirs, various water tanks and
the intricate pipeline system, all of
which will improve the quality of
the citys drinking water, said Ken-

These improvements could not
come any sooner, as most of the
city’s infrastructure had been built
at the turn of the century, and the
estimated life of such an infra-
structure is only about 100 years,
said Kenney.

“\X/e’re getting into the end of
our useful life,” Kenney’ said of

,Pittsburgh’s current sewage and

water delivery systems.

Speaking of Pitt students, Ken-
ney said, “This is money needed to
ensure their future, and their kids’
future.”

In addition to the environmen-
tal and human incentives for up-
dating infrastructure, the develop-
ment plans will also likely stimulate
local economic growth through
job creation, said Kenney.

“We have huge financial needs
in southwestern Pennsylvania
to enhance our aging pipes and
plants, particularly in many of the
towns struggling with plant clos-
ings, job losses and  popula-
tions,” said Kenney in an October
news release.

EPA neglects duty to

 protect environment

. regional

A recent decision by the En-

 vironmental Protection Agency
 will do little to protect the envi-
 ronment.

The Bush administration is
ﬁnalizing an EPA rule change

§ that would make it easier to
f build major polluters like coal-

ﬁred power plants and oil reﬁn-

i cries near national parks.

The agency proposal would
also alter the way pollution levels

; are measured. As it stands, pol-
? lution is measured over three-
 hour and 24-hour increments,
l a system that allows officials to

catch possible spikes in pollu-
tion emission. The proposed
change would look only at the
yearly average pollution levels,

. which means pollution spikes
‘ would no longer be illegal, The
: Washington Post reported.

But regional EPA adrninis—
trators have responded to the
plan with forceful opposition.
EPA Region 4 Administrator

3 I. Palmer Jr. told the Post that
 the proposal “would reduce
 consistency, accuracy and public
1 review” and “could allow great-
I er deterioration of air quality in
clean areas rather than prevent-
" ing signiﬁcant deterioration.”

Though half of the 10 EPA
administrators have
stated their formal opposition

 and many have urged against the

 change in written submissions,

1 the EPA is going along with the’
3 plan.

The reasoning behind the

1 EPA’s decision is not entirely
j clear. EPA spokesman Jonathan

Shradar told the Post that he was
unable to offer detailed com-

~ ments on the plan.

Chief of EPA’s air and radia-

l tion office Jeffrey R. Holmstead

said, according to the Post, that
the plan would not greatly affect
the parks, because “air quality in
national parks  has very little to
do with an individual source.”

The move is disturbing, coun— :
terintuitive and goes against the K

EPA’s goal to protect the envi-

ronment. The fact that the plan .

affects national parks makes it
all the more disturbing. It is up-

setting to see that our govern— 5
ment is willing to pollute even f

the most untainted areas.

National parks are valuable .
not only because of their aes— 

thetic appeal, but also because Q 3'

of their historical and ecological  

signiﬁcance —— the reason for  

which they are named national

parks. The EPA decision is a J 
harrowing gesture that basically 
tells Americans that nothing is 3

sacred.
Currently, national parks are

fraught with poor visibility and  

acid rain. Dangerous pollutants

like sulfur dioxide, carbon di- ‘

oxide and mercury affect parks.
Such a proposal would make this

worse. We worry what measures 5

the EPA will take next, what i

it will change for the worse.

Regional EPA ofﬁcials have 
done a commendable job in op— s

posing the plan so far, but their

‘ efforts have proven to be insuf— j

ﬁcient. The proposal is due to

other pollution regulation rules 5 by Brandon Pfeffer

sus Bureau. In India, millions
crowd into the slums of Mum-
bai and Calcutta, some of the
most densely populated areas on
the globe. Looking at states like

 Idaho, which house a few farm-
velopment of at least two dozen 

‘ers and their" Russet potatoes,

 it’s hard to imagine all that open
, space will be densely populated

 someday. .
 Even if it’s not, all that land is
 still owned by someone, whether
 they’re actually doing something
 productive with it or just holding
 onto it for speculation’s ‘sake. Free

land hasn’t been around since the
U.S. western frontier was still free

_ for the taking.

So with a growing population,
what will the future of property
rights — speciﬁcally land rights
-—— look like? According to Har-
old Kyriazi, Pittsburgh author
of “Libertarian Party at Sea on

» Land,” the current situation fa-

vors landowners who control a
limited but necessary commod-
ity: land.

You need it to move about,
settle or even exist. As time goes
by, with a largerpopulation and
a smaller proportion of_ people
controlling all of it, the situation
gets worse. Without land, youare
subject to a landowner’s whims
and rent prices, in essence “free
only to pick your master.”

By invoking the likes of Thomas
Paine, Henry George and Thom-

Prachi Gupta / Staff Cartoonist

 Hollowd Earth means more land

already troubling situation even i

as Jefferson, Kyriazi argues that
with a ﬁnite supply and an ever-
increasing demand, landowners
will eventually become the equiv-
alent of humanity’s slave—owners.
While the situation hasn’t reached
a “Grapes of Wrath” level with
hordes of hungry peasants watch-
ing on as acres of fertile land sit
idle, it’s never too early to look to-
ward solving the problem. Kyri—
azi offers‘ a compelling approach
about changing to a “land value

tax” system, but there are alterna-

tives that deserve exploring.

First step is deﬁning the vari-
ables. To get more land per per-
son — assuming it magically dis-
tributes itself evenly —— we either
need to reduce the number of
people or increase the amount of
habitable land, As many people

as there are currently cohabitat-

ing the planet, that -number is

Dear Editor,

I am disappointed that The Pitt News selected Justin Romeo as the best candidate for
Student Government Board president. Every election, candidates make appealing prom~
ises that are completely unfeasible if you know the first thing about the organization that
is SGB. Justin Romeo’s idea of SGB-awarded scholarships is a total empty promise and
demonstrates that he does not understand the position he is running for.

In a time when the economy is tight and scholarship money is difficult to come by,

' Romeo thinks the administration will be willing to fork over more money (in addition to

our $2.4 million student activities fee) so that popular students on the eighth floor of the
Union can give it out to whomever they see fit. The University already pays administrators

to do comprehensive research to determine who needs scholarship money. They  by

no means see SGB officials as the proper people to dispense their scholarship__Cmoney.

Furthermore, the project falls outside the scope of SGB. Perhaps before  for
president, Romeo should have taken a look at the SGB constitution (or be able to name
more than one SGB committee). We are elected to serve as representatives of . the student
body to administration, not to duplicate services already provided by the University.

I would hope that in the future The Pitt News will endorse candidates who understand
the position they are running for, not those who provide empty promises in desperation
to secure votes.

Dear Editor,

I cannot fathom how The Pitt News could have been swayed by Justin Romeo’s unre-
alistic campaign promises. As a student who has never had direct involvement with SGB

or the Pitt administration, Romeo has no idea how the system iworks.He promises an en— -

dowment fund, but has never stated where the money will come from. Does he think that
the administration will just hand over money to him just because he is president? Does
this really sound realistic? , _ I

Also, Romeo entered the race late. If he was dying to be president, wouldn’t he have
submitted his paperwork and formed his slate in a timely fashion? Because of his tardi-
ness, one can only wonder whether he looked at the other platforms before preparing his
own. - V i .

If Romeo had actually been to all of the SGB meetings this past year, as he stated in
the debate, I would think he would be aware of the committees. He fumbled around that
question, knowing very littleof what goes on in the SGB office. One would think that
The Pitt News would endorse a candidate that actually knows the student population and
interacts with the organizations on campus daily. The only thing that Romeo seemed to
know about was Sodexo, as that is the only thing that he referenced throughout the entire
debate. J

The president should be an individual who is aware of the system..I would hope that
the students would have enough awareness to realize that the person elected as SGB
president will need to work with student organizations, but even more so, the person will
need to work with Pitt administration. Romeo, with his minimal experience and lack of
knowledge regarding SGB and its operating procedures, is not the best candidate for Pitt
students. ’

Enter Globus Cassus, the con-
cept of Swiss architect Christian
Waldvogel. Globus Cassus is’ a
transformation of the Earth on
a massive scale, the new product
being a hollowed—out planet with

its inner mass redistributed to,

create almost 10 times as much
land area as we currently enjoy.
Waldvogel starts the construc-
tion process, which is slatedlfor
several million years, by setting
up four space elevators at equal-
ly spread—out locations around
Earth’s orbit. To set up the outer
framework of the new planet,
Earth’s crust, mantle and core are

. excavated and transformed into

l1igh—strength, low-density build-
ing material,i then shot through
the elevators and formed into the
skeleton, onto which the rest of
the project is constructed.

As the Earth we -know shrinks
from the excavation, gravity will
no, longer be able to hold the
atmosphere in place, but this,is
nothing to fret over. As the wa-
ter and atmosphere of our planet
drifts away, it finds itself funneled
onto the new equators of Glo-
bus Cassus. During this period
of “Great Rains,” humans must
seek shelter in the towers, eventu-

ally emerging to find themselves
living on one of two habitable
regions facing the other through
an enormous empty space in the
center. '

‘There might be a few prob-

‘ lems with this project, both lo-

gistical and theoretical, but Wald-
vogel’s work is so detail-oriented
it’s hard not to get excited about a
new andimproved home the size
of Saturn.

By increasing the total amount
of habitable land, we’ve thereby
solved our problem‘ and increased
everyone’s share of space without
resorting to painful decreases in

1601 East Carson St., Pittsburgh

Stella Maxwell looks forward to
’90s music making a big comeback.
And when it does, she and her
band, Cruiserweight, will be there
to play it.’ ‘

Cruiserweight’s fresh take on
a decade—old style will provide
nostalgic entertainment tonight
in Pittsburgh and rock the South
Side’s Diesel Club Lounge.

‘‘\We’ve never felt like we were on
the cutting edge or underground,
but maybe right now we are,” said
Maxwell, Cruiserweight’s lead sing-
er. “Maybe everyone should 
on our bandwagon, maybe we are
the cutting edge of cool now.”

Maxwell formed Cruiserweight
in 1998 with her brothers, guitarist
Urny Maxwell and drummer Yogi
Maxwell, and non—sibling bassist
Dave Hawkins.

NOW Ensemble makes orchestras hip

NOW Ensemble

Saturday, Nov. 529, 8 p.m.
Bellefield Hall Auditorium
www.proartstickets.org
Pitt students admitted free

While orchestra performances
have a tendency to conjure images
of sleepy concerts led by a wildly
gray—haired composer, NOW En-
semble is coming to Pittsburgh
on Saturday to rock the chamber
music scene. Literally.

With performances and re-
cordings with musicians like Suf-
jan Stevens and The National, on
its resume, this isn’t a typical or-
chestra.

NOW Ensemble, formed six
years ago at Yale’s School of Mu-
sic, is a seven—member group of
young musicians and compos-
ers. Its sound is unlike any other
group of its kind. When asked
to explain the group’s sound,
Pittsburgh native and composer
Patrick Burke laughed at the dif-
ﬁculty to form an answer.

“It combines the expert play-
ing of chamber music with the
energy and pulsing hypnotic
rhythm of pop and rock,” said
Burke. “T here’s a pop sensibility
to it.”

After classical training at
Duquesne University, Burke went
to the University of Texas and
then Yale to work on his doctor-
ate. At Yale, he met Judd Green-

stein and Sara Phillips and began
to set the gears in motion to bring
a new kind of performance group
to campus.

“We needed a better outlet for
our music,” said Burke. “Univer-
sity ensembles are fine, but we
wanted to reach a wider audience
with something that would work
better outside of school. We’re

trying to form a voice for our-

generation.”

Shortly after, four more mem-
bers joined the group, people
Burke described as “the best play-
ers, period. They’re my friends
so I’m biased but really, they are
awesome performers who can
play anything.”

The ensemble is comprised of
two composers and five players

Just In It for the Music

Music lists: a staplein any rock lover's heart-

 
  

by Justin Jacobs
A 09E E3itor

There are few  a music fan
loves more than lists  besides mu-
sic, of course.

We list the best  solos of

. all time. We list which ‘front men

had the best hair and which drurn—
mers were the drunkest. We list the
most inﬂuential ‘records, the most
important moments and the best
concerts.

Hell, I’m sure some rock ﬁend
out there before me has listed the
Five Best Songs from the Worst Ca-
nadian Rock Stars To Make it Big in
the States Between 1990 and 1999
— which, of course would be, in
ascending order of song quality, not
overall artist awﬁilness:

5. “My Heart Will Go On” by
Celine Dion (Much better after it
stopped being on the radio every 18
seconds. Honestly).

4. “l\/ﬂ\/l1\/Il\/IM[\/[l\/]l\/11\/Il\/[l\/I1\/I’ ’

catchy if nothing else).
3. “Brian Wilson” by Barenaked

, Ladies (Face it, “One Week” was an-

noying) .

2. “Leader of Men” by Nick-
elback (To date, the first and only
Nickelback song that doesn’t make
me want to go deaf. It also, interest-
ingly, was the band’s first hit; They
sucked about 98 percent less pre-
fame).

1.“You’re Still the One” by Sha-
nia Twain (I can’t help it, the video
was hot).

Some rock obsessives have even
gone so far as to make lists of lists.
in 2004, Bntish rock magazine Q
put out an issue listing the 150 best
lists about rock ’n’ roll. This is some
complex stuff.

Just this week, Rolling Stone re-
leased its list of the 100 Best Singers
(presumably of the rock era), which
is topped off with the queen of soul,
Aretha Franklin, and ends with the

deserving Mary J. Blige. The issue is
just the latest Rolling Stone list with

such rankings —— the magazine has -

already compiled its take on the 500

more information.

 
  
  
   

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.comt

Best Records, 500 Best Songs and
100 Best Guitarists. And like all rock
lists, all of them were fraught with
mistakes.

But herein lies the magic of lists.
For any music head, few conversa-
tion topics are more engaging than
debating over the quality of every as-
pect of said music. Is Conor Oberst
of Biight Eyes as good a lyricist as
Bob Dylan? (No.) Did the grit-tiness
of the Black Keys suffer after 
Danger Mouse to produce? (_Yes.)
What is the perfect number of beers
to consume in order to best enjoy a
Hold Steady concert? (As many as
you can drink and remain standing.)

Lists, then, give us natural fod-
der to discuss and tear apart. They
provide us with arbitrary and all-

but—ineaningless rankings to‘ agree

with and defend — or ‘disagree with,

' curse to hell and propose a more

correct ranking
Sound fun? No? Well, that’s

probably why people tend to avoid
talking to me for more than three or
four minutes at a time.

You might ask, why can’t you just

 

 

enjoy the music without  to
rank it?

I’d answer that you just don’t un-
derstand fun. I’d then correctly guess
that your , Facebook account lists
your favorite music as “Everything!
Except countryll”

Rock lists also serve as a trial by

A ﬁre when first  to a friend.

Want to know how much New
Guy Chuck knows about your fa-
vorite genre? Ask him about what
he thinks are the top three second
wave emo bands. If he answers The

Promise Ring,'Texas is the Reason

and Sunny Day Real Estate you’ve

got a new friend for endless music
banter.

Congratulations — you’re one
more person away from having to
talk about  of substance!

When we boil list—loving down,
it’s simply human nature to catego-

rize the  we adore Just like

everything in your room has a cer-
tain place, so too do the Top Four

which, of course, would be: 1. Ex-

plosions in the Sky, 2. Sigur Ros,/3.

' Godspeed! You Black Emperor and

4. Mogwai.

Putting our music in categories,
moreover, gives us some ownership
of the things that we love so dearly.
My list will always be different from
your list That’s just the way it goes
— we all like different things, and
examining why each of us value dif-
ferent music to varying degrees can
tell us  about other people we
could never find out by simply talk-
ing.

For example, I know my girl-
friend’s Five Favorite Vocalists are 1.
Anthony Green of Circa Survive, 2.
John Gourley of Portugal. The Man,
3. Davey Von Bohlen of The Prom-
ise  , 4. Tim Kasher of Cursive
and 5. Christina Aguilera. Did I ask
her? Nope — you just learn these

 from paying attention. And

even though that last one is pretty
lame, the power of the list is strong

, with her.

Jack Bauer makes an explosive

return to primetiine this Sunday

by Noah Levinson
Staff" Write/‘

“24: Redemption”

Sunday, Nov. 23, 8 p.m.
Starring: Kiefer Sutherland
Fox

Oh no. There’s a red clock on the TV
counting the seconds with annoying beeps
 3:05:23, 3:05:24, 3:05:25. It can only mean
one thing: jack Bauer is back from the writ-
er’s strike and ready to kick some terrorist
buttocks.

“24: Redemption” is nothing more than
an extended regular episode, something that
the writers created during the writer’s strike
because they were getting bored of Sudoku
and Rock Band. The story is quite absurd
and predictable: Jack needs to safely trans-
port the students of the school to the U.S.
embassy to be ﬂown off to safety (with dra-
matic music).

Butjack is about to face the most vile and
despicable enemy on the face of the planet:
a Senate sub-committee requesting his pres-
ence in Washington to testify for all 185 peo-
ple he killed and the countless he tortured.
Looks like all that going against the books
is finally catching some sweet Congressional
attention.

In the special two—hour television movie
“24: Redemption,” we ﬁnd Jack hiding from
his subpoena in a South African school
where a major coup/ genocide is brewing.
Thank God South Africa is housing the one
and only Jack Bauer.

Then meet jack Bauer’s second enemy:
South African child soldiers, making it a little
more difficult, because even for Jack Bauer,
killing kids with miscellaneous gunﬁre an
explosions is a little dirty. 4

However, that doesn’t stop jack from tak-
ing out an entire squad of adult South Af-
rican soldiers with only two handguns and

four sticks of dynamite. The actions scenes
in “24: Redemption” are fun. It is male-
driven, testosterone—powered, bullet-happy
chaos. V

If anything, “24: Redemption” isn’t any
better than other 24 episodes because that’s
the only main action sequence in the entire
show. \When it’s all said and done, I’m just
begging for some more Jack Bauer patented
violence.

“24: Redemption” is dragging its feet in
the mud. New characters are introduced,
while the audience is steered to see Jack in
a more philosophical and humane light.
There’s so much humanity, that I even con-
sidered reading a book at one point.

Viewers don’t turn on 24 to watch ]ack’s
intelligent and wise personality, They want
to see a helicopter exploding and killing
some corrupt political ﬁgure, expelling the
remnants of a top—secret document into the
ocean, which then explodes, followed by sev-
en—to—10 random explosions in various loca-
tions through the use of split—screen camera
shots. Then the oceans turn into lava, and
the shit just hits the fan.

Perhaps it would be more appropriate to
rename “24: Redemption,” as "24: Transi-
tion." It looks like the writer’s wanted to start
the seventh season off in a different direc-
tion, with a different cast, but didn’t know
how to get there from the end of last sea-
son (]ack staring off into the ocean, regular
ocean, mind you, not the lava ocean, with
doubt in his eyes and thought in his mind 
but no automatic riﬂes in his hands).

Get used to some new faces. Cherryjones
plays President—elect Allison Taylor (Only if
Hillary ran for president in Jack Bauer’s uni-
Verse), a strong, intelligent face full of some
sort of plastic surgery to make it look like
her face is stretched back to infinity.

Monty) is Carl Benton, the director of the

— ﬂute, clarinet, electric guitar, piano and
double bass — all from Yale or Juilliard.
With a “do—it—yourself attitude,” Burke and
his peers set out to “play music we like and
enjoy.”

“This is a totally different type of mu-
sic,” said Burke. “We don’t play museum
music that sounds like it’s for dead people.
A lot of chamber music just sounds like it’s
in a museum.”

The group stays busy teaching at college
music programs in between frequent per-
formances in and around New York.

“Our performances are a more casual
atmosphere than you’d expect. Unlike
typical chamber music concerts, everyone’s

Cruiserweight embraces
its ‘girl band‘ identity

€Criuiserweight,. page 10

“Being a band that was three-fourths sib-
lings, there was naturally no ‘way we could
agree on a name,” said Maxwell. “We ﬁnally
pulled out a Trivial Pursuit game and started

tossing out cards.” “Cruiserweight,” a wres-

tling term for the weight category between
lightweight and heavyweight, was the winner.
A ‘Cruiserweight often ﬁnds itself billed as
a girl band, somewhat ironically since Stella

 is the only female band member.
,Maxwell herself does not dwell on the fact

that 1 the band is female—fronted, but does
acknowledge that many do pay attention to
such" gender" distinctions. J

Rather than ﬁghting this classiﬁcation and

-the stigma attached to it, the group has ac-

cepted it unreservedly. _

“We’re proud of the fact that we’re female
fronted, even peopleare going to ste-
reotype us for that,” said  “It can be
an easy way to make ourselves stand out in
a group, having a "female lead singer, but it’s
not gimmicky. We’ve\‘been part of a couple
of girl—power communities and featured as
such, and Iithink that’s great. There’s nothing
wrong with it.”

Cruiserweight is currently touring with
Pink Spiders and Primo Mondo, promoting
its sophomore album Bzg Bold Letim, which
came out in early October.

Of the tour so far Maxwell said, “it’s been
great. We’ve done some sketchy tours ir1 the
past, but the Pink Spiders are great guys who
really ﬁt in well with us and our music, so it’s
all been really good. We make a lot of sacri-
ﬁces to be able to record and tour with this
band, but we love it.” ‘

Maxwell said the band played some great

shows with_ audiences who got into it by.

singing along and dancing, but audience par-
ticipation isn’t the only  that can make
a concert good. The act of performing the
music itself can play a  part.

“It’s great when people aren’t afraid to
show their enthusiasm like that,” she said.

“At the same time, though, when we’re in '

sync with each other and the songs .are ﬂow-
ing together, that makes it an awesome show
regardless of the crow .” .

The band does not ‘ﬁt what most would
deﬁne as todafs pop-punk genre, preferring
a more antiquated sound. '

“I jokingly like to describe us as a late
‘90s slumber party rock band. We’ve had a
slow.evolution over the 10 years that we’ve
been together,” said Maxwell. “We haven’t

' embraced new trends, not because we don’t

like them, but just that what feels natural to
us comes from the ‘90s bands. "We write the
songs that we know how to write.”

There’s something to be said for looking

forward, but there’s also nothing wrong with

a fond look back.
Everyone misses ’90s music now and
then. But when the classics themselves be-

‘come stale, pop—punk band Cruiserweight

keeps it fresh.

'24 : Redemption‘ should 

be called '24 :

recruﬁs

announced

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team
announced the signing of four
high school recruits for the 2009-
10 season yesterday, ending the
NCAA Division I early signing
period that began Nov. 12.

, And while a lot of recruiting
revolves around speculation, Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon said he and
his team have a lot to be excited
about 5

Pitt signed 6-foot-9 Dante
Taylor — one of the most highly
touted forwards in the country —
along with swingman Lamar Pat-
terson and forwards  Richard-
son and Talib Zanna.

Taylor, who is originally from
New York, plays high school
basketball at National Christian
Academy in Fort Washington,
Md., where he averaged 18 points
and 11 rebounds per game as a
junior. Dixon said that Taylor’s
signing came because he and the
Pitt coaching staff have been’re-
cruiting him since he started high
school. . I

And while there were numer-
bus other programs going after
Taylor, Dixon said he had conﬁ-
dence that Taylor would sign.

“He seemed to always want to
go to Pitt,” said Dixon. “He always
_told us he was.”

Taylor chose Pitt over power-
house programs like Kansas, Flor-
ida, Connecticut, Villanova, West
Virginia, Georgetown, Syracuse
and Memphis, among others. I
‘ Taylor’s size is matched by

Zarma, who is also 6—foot-9. Rich-
ardson stands at 6-foot-7, wile Pat-
terson is listed at 6—foot—5. With
current Pitt forwards Sam Young
and Tyrell Biggs graduating after
this season, Dixon said ‘size was
deﬁnitely something he focused
on during the recruiting process.

“We had to get size,” said Dix-
on. “And we obviously did.”

Women enlisting

men for practice  

by Ben Duignan
Staﬂ Writer

Greg Sencak remembers a
shaky start to his experience that
quickly ﬂourished into some-
thing that he truly relishes.

He has been practicing with
the women's basketball team this
semester. ~

“The first week was awkward
’cause I didn’t know any of [the
basketball player’s names],” said
Sencak. “I was tentative because
I didn’t really know what was go-
ing on.”

Sencak got the gig after he re-
plied to an ad in The Pitt News
that Pitt coach Agnus Berenato
and her staff placed, calling for
male basketball players to "com-
pete in everyday practice."

Sencak is the first to partici-
pate in Pitt practices.

After a couple of practices
with the team, Sencak easily
shed anything that was holding
him back from enjoying the ex—‘
perience.

“I’m a lot more comfortable
now,” said Sencak. “I think it’s a
great opportunity. I mean, I’m a
huge basketball fan and I think
playing with [Division I] players,
and just playing on the Peter-
son Events center court is awe-
some.”

So far, the team has only
three men competing, but Be-
renato thinks they have a pro-
found effect in the development
of her female players.

“They give us a physical
presence that we wouldn’t have
otherwise,” said Berenato. “They
give our players someone a little
bigger and a little stronger to
match-up against.”

The team isn’t taking just any
guy that wants to practice, how-
ever. The process of becoming
part of the practice squad in-
cludes filling out paperwork", a
physical and an interview with
the coaches.

Some of the paperwork com-
prises of a complete medical
history, contact information and
clearance forms.

The men who sign up ‘have to
go.through almost the same pro-
cess that a walk-on recruit would
have to go through to become a
part of the roster.

Two freshmen, Camryn Lem-
berger and Omar Abdullah, are
in the application process and
can’t wait to get out on the hard-
wood.

“I expect it to be a lot of
fun anda lot of hard work,” said
Lemberger. ‘

Abdullah knows that there’s

The Panthers are coming off a

The Mitsch Report

Rodriguez's tro

*3: .

\

by Pat Nlitsch
Senior Staﬂ Wrtrer

   
  

I would have thought Rich Ro-
fx‘£lI'igL1CZ heard it all by now.

This is a coach who had his
name put on a gravestone and
displayed in a Charleston, \WVa.,
storefront after he left the Moun-
taineers last year. The governor of
West Virginia called him a “victim
of high-priced spo;ts agents.”
The West Virginia fan base (or
fan bunker) said things unﬁt for
print. -

So when he took the country

-road out of West Virginia to the
place where he thought he be-
longed — Michigan — he probably
thought he’d left all that behind
for greener pastures in Ann Ar-
bor. '

Weﬂ, guess what? Michigan
is blue and gold, too. And the
people who bleed it aren’t nearly
as patient as Rodriguez’s brethren.
Michigan is 3-8 in his first season
— the first eight-loss season Mich-

igan has ever had.» The program
started in 1879, so you wouldn’t
imagine Michigan fans are used

to this type of feeling. Yet Rodri-ii

guez still is shocked at some of
the backlash. .
“It’s amazing some of the

- things that ‘people would say [on

a message board] or yell at you
of a personal nature,” said Ro-
driguez to the Associated Press
Monday. “You almost want to tell
them, ‘Get a life.’ There’s a whole
lot bigger problems. Look at the
economy.” .

Look at the auto industry, for *

that matter. But please, look at
anything but our team! V
Actually, look at Boston Red
Sox pitcher Jonathan Papelbon.
When he _ even hinted that he
thought he should be the closer,
not the,Yankees’ Mariano Rivera,
for the Major League Baseball All-
Star Game this pastjuly at Yankee
Stadium, he and his pregnant wife
were pelted with threats from de-
lirious Yankees fans. Lance Arm-
strong even said this week that

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

he fears he’d be attacked by Tour
de France spectators if he races
again.

So yes, Rich, it is amazing what

people will say and to whom they’ll .

say it. But rest assured they’ll say
it, no matter where you are or
who you coach, if you lose. They
said it in West Virginia when you
lost to Pitt and then bolted, and
they’re saying it in Michigan when
you have to throw the economy
out there as‘ a distraction. Even
so, it’s not appropriate. Never has
been, never will be. Butthis kind

, of spew happens, and most likely
always will. i

_ The only way to hush it all, at
least for this season? A ‘win for
the lowly Wolverines in their last
game against hated rival Ohio
State. It would ruin the Buckeyes’
Rose.Bowl hopes.

-“[If] we go down there and

beat them, they have no chance to '

go to the Rose Bowl,” said Michi-
gan safety Brandon Harrison to

Notebook: Bye Week vital

in preparing for Cincinnati

Michael Heaterl Photo‘Editor

Pitt receiver Jonathan Baldwin pulls in a pass against Louisville Nov. 8 at Heinz Field.

The Panthers play Cincinnati Saturday in a game that could decide the Big ‘East winner. _

by Jasmine Hawkins
Staﬂ W/riter
This late in the football season, many may
question the beneﬁcial aspects of having a bye
week '

While there’s a chance that Pitt has lost its

momentum, coach Dave Wannstedt saw the.

week off as an opportunity to address issues and
situations that needed improvement.
“I thought our bye week last week went

well,” said Wannstedt at his weekly press confer— .

ence “I think with as many young players as we
have playing, we were able to utilize it in a very
positive way.”

Wannstedt’s theory and improvement tac-
tics will be up for review this weekend when the

‘Panthers take on the No. 19—ranked Cincinnati
Bearcats. _

Coming off wins over both West Virginia
and Louisville, Cincinnati has undoubtedly built
up momentum. A victory over the Panthers will
be exactly what the Bearcats need to dominate
the Big East Luckily for Pitt, it’s an away game

With an away record of 4-0, in addition to a
week of relaxation, Pitt will pose a challenge for
the fearless Bearcats.

Improving the secondary ,

Pitt has struggled in the secondary this year.
Holding Louisville ‘to seven points two weeks
ago was an accomplishment for the Panthers,
but let’s not forget the 54-34 loss to Rutgers Oct.
25, in which Mike Teel threw six touchdown
passes The Panthers have givenup a total of 93
points in their last three games

During the bye we'ek,Wannstedt said the em-
phasis was on  the secondary. While it’s
nearly inevitable that the opponent will connect a
few good passes, Wannstedt's focus over the past
week was on the psychological aspect .

“If you watch our first touchdown to Od-
erick Turner against Louisville, they had him
covered,” said Wannstedt,  his own offense
as an example. ‘jonathan  two

catches a game when the other team has him
covered The  that are inexcusable are the
mental mistakes when someone’s turned loose
I think we’ve done a nice job this past week of
addressing those  and hopefully cleaning
those  up.”

Incentives to win

Besides conﬁrming conference dorrlination, ,

a win for either team will have greater effects

Both teams are  for a better 
in the national polls. In the USA Today/ ESPN
coaches poll, the Panthers are ranked 19th and
the Bearcats 20th, while the  are reversed
in the AP. '

Pitt leads the overall series 7-0, so a ‘Cincin-
nati win will break the historic losing streak for
the Bearcats.

In addition to already securing a bowl game,
defeating Cincinnati, and possibly going on to
win the BigEast,willmarka noteworthy turnin
the Dave Wannstedt era at Pitt. 7

Working with Wannstedt

Prior to Wannstedfs arrival, the Panthers were
the Big East champions Since then, many reser-
vations have been made about the effectiveness
of Wannstedt as a coach. \V1th only his 
classes now on the team, Wannstedt is in a per-
fect position to display his coaching abilities.

“I told our players that the two  I really

thought about when I took this job was, No. 1, _

winning a championship,” said Wannstedt “No.
2, I wanted to get this program to a point where
when we’re playing a national team, our kids have
enough talent from top to bottom to legitimately
say thatifweplaygoodwe canwin.”

With a recordof 7-2, this is by far Wannst—
edt’s best season at_Pitt. It may have taken a few
years, but it’s possible that the fans are ﬁnally see-

. ingwhat he envisioned back in 2005.

“I’d like to think we’ve done a nice job,” said
Wannstedt “We still have some work to do, but
I’d like to think we’ve closed the gap." ‘

Western Michigan, a member of th
Mid—American Conference, is coming off
a 68—67, last—second loss to SainttLouis in
its ﬁrst game of the season. Sophomore
Brenna Banktson led all scorers with 22
points, while freshman Miame Giden added
19 points. A

“They are a great team,” said Berenato,
“They had a really tough‘ loss the other

Berenato expects to see a lot of man-to~

Broncos.

going to be a lot expected of him, but he’s

more than ready to rise to the challenge.

“It’s going to be an intense atmosphere
’cause the coaching staff expects us to de-
liver a physical presence on the basketball
court, but there’s no question it’s going to
be fun,” said Abdullah. '

The men are mostly contributing on
the defensive side of the ball, where they
provide aggressive defense.

Sophomore guard Taneisha Harrison

agrees with Berenato and thinks the men b
"competing in practice is helping her game

develop tremendously. _

“Some of the time, [the men] are on
the post, and they play more aggressive
[than the female players] so they help

our post play,” said Harrison. “They also .

bring a lot of on—ball pressure, so it makes
our guards much better ball—handlers.”

In a conference as competitive as the
Big East, the coaches hope the male pres-

ence on the basketball court will help to ‘

develop a new brand of tenacity that Pitt
will play with for the rest of the year.
“The conference we’re in is very ag-
gressive, so we need that aggressiveness,
in practice.to make us work hard,” said
Harrison. . ‘

team, the girls aren’t the only ones ben-
eﬁting from this scenario.

While all of themen share» the same
motive in trying to develop the female
players, Lemberger has another reason to
make it out to practice.

“I’m very interested in pursuing a ca-
reer in coaching, and I think this is a great
opportunity to make contacts,” said Lem-
berger.

of the best coaches in women’s basketball,
there isn’t a better place to start. Lem-
berger can’t wait to learn from Berenato,

as she tries to coach her team‘ to another

NCAA Tournament appearance.
Although the coaches don’t require the

"men to show up to every practice, they’re

encouraged to, and there is no question
that their presence is appreciated.

As this program grows during the sea-

up so there is consistent attendance at

In the end, Pitt’s goal is to develop a

full all—male scout team that will be avail-

Berenato undoubtedly has the utmost

respect for the guys that make it out to
practice, and she knows why these men “
have decided to come out and dedicate ‘

their time to the team.

More than anything, they love this
game and they love this university,” said
Berenato.
