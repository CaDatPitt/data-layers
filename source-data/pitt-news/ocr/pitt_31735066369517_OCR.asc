Posvcir, Students Lobby In Capital  
For Increased Pitt Appropriations

_ By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Public and.Governmental
Relations Committee will continue
its lobbying efforts when its
members travel to Harrisburg
tomorrow to hear Chancellor
Wesley Posvar state his case for
increased funding before the
House Appropriations Committee.

The lobby committee, along with
members of the Pennsylvania
Association of State-Related Uni-
versities will be the only student
lobbying groups verbally recog-
nized before both the state House

and Senate.

“Across the state the response to
student lobbyists by new legisla-
tors has been very good because
these students are more organized
than ever,” Jeff Miller, chairman
of the committee, said.

Miller said some equalization
between the two ends of Gov.

Richard Thornburgh’s budget pro-
Dosal will be sought. Thornburgh’s
budget calls for a seven percent
increase for state-owned colleges
on one end, while leaving
state-related schools with only a
five percent increase.

“Inroads have already been
made to increase the level of
funding for the state-related
schools to that of the state-owned
schools.” Miller said.

“In order for us to be most
effective we have to bring attention
of the legislators that higher
education is not only a student
problem, but it is a problem faced
by each and every individual in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,”
Miller said. “By in large members
of the legislature themselves are
products of higher education.”

The committee will stress in-
creased demands for jobs requiring
higher education, Miller said.

“The use of higher education is
higher now than it has ever been,”
Miller said. “Corporations actually
pay to use institutions of higher
learning to train their people.”

Pitt now has the highest tuition
of any state funded school across
the nation.
warned lawmakers that his recom-
mended increase will not be
sufficient to avert the fourth tuition
increase at Pitt in as many years.

“The problem with Pennsylvania
is that it is pricing its students right
out of the state,” Miller said, “and
if these spiraling tuition increases
continue,.more and more students
will find other schools where it is
cheaper to get a quality education.

The committee will continue its
Harrisburg lobby when Posvar
meets with members of the Senate
Appropriations Committee Apr. 9.

Posvar has already,

The Pittsburgh Pirates aren’t the only ones who are busy practicing for an upcoming summer of baseball.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar will travel to Harrisburg where the House Ap-
propriations Committee will hear Pitt’s case for increased appropriations.

SGB Calls Time Out,
Mulls Over Budgets

— -By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News StaffWriter

Student Government Board has taken a time out to consider
compromises for ﬁve of its seven governance groups budgets.

A board meeting scheduled for today was cancelled to give members
an opportunity to put together acceptable reconstructions of the
budgets, according to a memo written by SGB president Stan Galanski
to board members. ,

At its March 28 meeting, the board had rejected 4-3 a second
submission from its Allocations Committee of recommended budgets
for the Black Action Society, Inter-Fraternity Council, Engineering
Student Cabinet, Panhellenic Association and Nursing Student
Organization. V »

Ok’ed at that meeting were the budgets of Inter-Honorary Council"
and Resident Student Association. ‘

Allocations had first put all governance group budgetsup for SGB
approval at its March 21 meeting with the board downing all seven
budgets by a decisive 5-1 vote. S A

Factors splitting the board, as reflected in its most recent vote, are a
cut made in BAS’ budget and an increase in the total recommended in
combined budgets for Greeks.

Allocations recommended $6,546 for BAS——over $4,000 less than the
group received last year—while Inter-Fraternity Council, Panhellenic
Association and Greek Week stand to receive $15,505, almost $5,000
more than that block of groups received in fiscal 1978-79. -

SGB member Todd Park, who voted at the March 28 meeting against
the second submission of the budgets, said he didso because budgets
for Greeks included funding for formals and he was “dissatisfied with
the amount of money given to BAS.”

C°°k Ph°t°- The amount allocated for formals puts only a small dent in the total

  Marijuana DecrimpinaIizationA NORML Goal  

By MARK HOLAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Despite its illegality, there are
350,000 "regular users of marijuana
in the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, representing every age, race
and socio-economic group, includ-
ing students.

The first and only Western
Pennsylvania chapter of the Na-
tional Organization for the Reform
of Marijuana Laws, or “UP”

(University of Pittsburgh) NORML,
as it is called by members, is the
newest special interest organiza-
tion on campus.

The organization received its
charter early last month and
currently has approximately 35
active members. Their goal is to
make Pitt students more aware of
the pot dilemma in Pennsylvania
and motivate them to work for a
change--namely the decriminali-

zation of marijuana laws.

In order to accomplish this, UP
NORML activities include letter-
writing campaigns to state legisla-
tors to urge passage of bills which
would decrease penalties for
marijuana use. Lobbying techni-
ques will also be used. ~

UP NORML plans to travel to
Harrisburg Apr. 23 to show support
of a pending bill that--if passed-
would make possible the use of

marijuana for medicinal purposes.

“Right now we are trying to
build a solid base to work from,”
said chairperson Stacy Stull. “We
need as much student support as
we can get,_” she added.

Stull and other members said
they do not want to be associated
with leftist student political organi-
zations.

“This is not a hippie club where
all we do is sit around and get high

all the time,” said Brian Benedict,
an UP NORML member. “We are
very serious about our goals.”

‘The group is financially inde-
pendent of its parent organization
and also receives partial funding
from the Student Government
Board Allocations Committee. The
remainder of its funds’ are raised
through the sale of T-shirts and
buttons.

Gay Supporters Talk Issues With Press During Media Week

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

In an effort to give the
community a better understanding
of the gay rights issues, the
National Gay Task Force declared
last week “National Week of
Dialogue with the Media About
Gay and Lesbian Concerns.”

The purpose of this program,
according to president Rick Scott of
the Gay Supporters of Pitt, was to
“discuss the treatment of gay
issues by the media with the
individuals who are directly res-
ponsible for the information which
reaches the public..’ ’

» The goal is to educate and raise
the consciousness level of people,
Scott said, in order to eliminate
what he calledl“unfairness” with
which gay concerns have tradition-
ally been handled.

' “When I came into office at Pitt,
I thought we were recognized
here,” said Scott, “but it turned
out we were not. Right now we are
trying to get some funding from the
Student Government Board. It’s
goingto be a big problem because
our policy forbids exposing mem-
bers names besides those who hold

an office. This will cause a problem
when the SGB is checking for
undergraduate status of mem-
bers.”

Membership in the Gay Support-
ers is not limited to Pitt students
alone. Membership is varied;
some are openly gay, some are
bisexual and some are “straight.”

To be known as a member of the
organization can be a cause of
many problems and hassles to the
person involved, Scott said.

“If it would get to be known that
someone was gay or just in support
of gay rights, it could be used
against them very much,” said

Scott. “Consequences can be very
disastrous.”
Scott believes some university

professors are a source of problems 0

for the gay student.

“Some profs avoid the problem
of gay issues in their classrooms,”
said Scott, “although the womens
studies program gives far better
treatment. The Lesbian Feminist
Collective are putting on perfor-

mances of their theatre group
called “Real Live Lesbians.”

The Gay Supporters are planning
a Gay Awareness Day next
November. In October the group
will be involved in a national march
of the national gay and lesbian
groups on Washington D.C., a
project Scott believes will turn out
many people in the Pittsburgh
area.

—— Voter Registration

The Public and Governmental
Relations Committee of the Student
Government Board is conducting a
campus-wide voter registration
campaign.

The campaign is co-sponsored by
the College Republicans and
College Young Democrats with the
financial support coming from the
governmental relations committee.

According to Betty Osterman, a
member of the committee, only 14
percent of all college students
across the nation are registered to
vote.

To remedy the problem of low
voter registration the committee

well as funding an insert in today’s
Pitt News.

The insert may be used to
register any student for any voting
district in Pennsylvania. Although
the mailing address on the form is
one for Allegheny County, that
address can be changed to the

student's home district.

Membership varies in numbers
from meeting to meeting. Mem-
bers of , the Lesbian Feminist
Collective also attend meetings.

“Members come and go so it is
hard to estimate just how many we
actually have,” said Scott. “We
are living in an urban area so there

are alternatives for people to -

become involved in. We average
15-18 members at each meeting.”

they always ask, ‘How do we know
people really care if they aren’t
even registered to vote,’ Osterman
said.

Committee chairman Jeff Miller
said legislators are only concerned
with the problems of constituents
(those who are eligible and will
vote for them).

“A constituent is what every Pitt

student should want to be if they
want their legislators to help
them,” Miller said.

“Even though J ennifer’s still our patient, she’s like

more and more children with leukemia, the chances are
good that someday she’ll be growing old. 7’

James F. Holland, M.D.
Chairman, Cancer and Leukemia Group B

Once J ennifer’s future would have been far from
bright. Then childhood leukemia meant almost certain
death. It took many long years, but now things are
changing. Not only for children with leukemia, but
through what we’ve learned working to save them, for
patients with many other types of cancer as well.

Leukemia research helped us ﬁndtreatments to
keep cancers from spreading. Treatments that kill traces
of disease so they won’t threaten a patient’s life. For
thousands of people who’ll beat cancer this year, these new
approaches will make the difference. In a very real way,
they’ll have children like Jennifer to thank for their lives.

Cancer is hundreds of different diseases. There
won’t be a single answer. But there is continuing progress.

Board Cancels Meeting  

SGB Still Considering Five Governance Group Budgets

(Continued from page I)

expense incurred by attendees,
Park said in explaining why he
believes these functions should not
be funded.

Additionally, “considering the
amount of money we have, we just
can’t spend it on formals, ’ ’ he said.

BAS receives $27,000 from the

university annually in addition to
SGB funding, a fact “people make
an issue of...but a lot of thatg
money goes for programming for
the community. That’s part of their
(BAS’) charter,” Park said.

Former BAS chairman Mark
one of the group’s
representatives at SGB’s latest
meeting, said in an earlier
interview that university money
BAS receives is used for ser-
vice-oriented functions both in
Oakland and in surrounding
communities. ’

Park said he would like to see
funding for a $1,577 lecture pro-
posed by BAS as part of its Black
History Month schedule.

Park said he has drawn up a
compromise ‘proposal designed
to fund the lecture if it is left out
during SGB reconstruction of BAS’
budget.

The proposal calls for putting
the amount needed for the lecture
into an escrow account.

Pitt Union Council would then
be offered the option of funding the
event out of the escrow account, he
said, and if the council turns down
the option SGB could then proceed
to sponsor the lecture.

Such a compronise would not
further detain affirmation of the
BAS budget because the council
is required to have drawn up its

itinary for next year by Apr. 30,”
Park said.

‘‘I don’t think you can look at
BAS as your average governance
group because there is a distinct
Black culture (on the Pitt campus)
while there’s is a distinct engin-
eer’s culture, nurse’s culture, et
cetera. - C

“I don’t think people (those
opposing an increase in BAS
funding) are thinking about what
would happen is the shoe was on
the other foot. They’re thinking
from a white perspective,” Park
said.

However, SGB member Helen
Gianella, who opposes the recon-
struction of the five governance
group budgets, ﬁnds fault with
the compromise proposed by Park.

To offer a funding altermative
such as the compromise Park sug-
gests is “unfair” to other
governance groups, she said, be-
cause the alternative is not offered
to the remaining six organizations.

~ “In effect (the compromise)
gives BAS that money. I feel they
have enough money," Gianella
stated.

“I trust the Allocations Com-
mittee (recommendations). That’s
why they’re there,” she said.

Rita Cordisco, another SBG
member who, like Park, would like
to see BAS receive additional
funding, said she believes some
type of compromise on the budget
situation will be reached.

“The main thing now is to reach
a compromise. All of us have to sit
down and air our views, see where
everyone stands...and why each of
us stands the way we do,” she
said.

      

If SGB successfully reconstructs
the budgets, a process which must
take place over the next week, the
recommendations will again be
voted upon, according to board
policies and procedures.

The ﬁnal vote must register at
least five votes in favor of the re-
comstructions or the budgets will
automatically be approved ac-
cording to Allocations Committee
recommendations.

Opinion  

, V Sports Cuts
Wrong Move

Cas Myslinski has revealed some possible changes
in ‘Pitt’s athletic department that could drastically af-
fect the athletic teams here and perhaps turn the
program into a specter of its now healthful self. The
athletic director has revealed that Pitt might phase
out or lessen the support of the present Panther
teams.

Myslinski has reported that dropping enrollment,
declining funds ‘and the demand for ‘more space for
recreation activities could lead to the termination of
some teams or perhaps substantially decrease fun-
ding for some existing teams. He has said some
sports could be turned into club sports or teams like
track could be changed so no dual meets would be
held and thinclads would run in invitattional meets
only. Other anonymous sources have given even dim-
_ir_ier reports o_n__c_i_i_tbacks in the field hockey team;
it has been said that hockey will receivewrio new
money for scholarships next year. As a result the
team would cease to exist when players now on
scholarships graduate.

While these sports face potential extinction, the
aristocrats of the athletic department—the football
and basketball teams—would be untouched. Myslin-
ski said since these programs raise enough revenues
to fund themselves, and attract generous donations
from alumni, they would suffer no cutbacks.

The possibility of these cuts in the athletic budget
are frightening. It should be the goal of the univer-
sity to seek to maintain varied programs in any area,
including athletics. To end a sport merely because it

is not profitable makes it seem the ultimate goal of
the administration is profit, much like any American
businessman. It would appear there IS precious little

care about the purpose of any university—to provide .

as diverse an educational experience as it possibly
can.

Not only would such cutbacks undermine this pur-
pose of our university, but it would also threaten the
base of the athletic program itself. Decreased support
in such areas as the end of dual meets for the track
team would show a lack of interest that could hurt
the recruitment efforts of all Panther sports. If
prospective athletes see a dearth of backing for
athletic teams here, they will attend other schools,
which demonstrate interest in sports of all types.

The reasoning behind the discussed changes ap-
pears to be faulty too. One of the main reasons
Myslinski gives for the cuts is the demand for more
space for recreational sports and intramural sports.
The athletic department has been forced to be more
concerned with recreation since a report to the
university's Senate Athletic Committee showed
recreation and intramural sports were the forgotten
child of athletics at Pitt. Now that the Senate has
taken an interest in recreation, it seems minor sports
are a sacrificial lamb to intramural sports. Surely, it
is possible to solve this problem by addressing some
of the other blocks to recreation cited by the athletic
committee.

To argue that we must terminate lesser sports

.- because of dropping enrollments is also a warped

perspective on the problem. Instead of cutting sports
teams because‘ there are less students, Pitt should
maintain these sports and use them as a drawing
point when it tries to attract potential students.

If money is the reason why we‘ cannot support

Page 6-—Wednesda,v. April 4, 1979

these teams, the favorite son of the athletic depart-
ment could be used as a source of funds for the sports
like tennis, swimming, track, field ‘ hockey and
wrestling. Much of the money spent on the football
team could be put to much better use than it is now.
Instead of pouring money into luxurious offices for
football coaches and recreation rooms for football
players—-complete with a pool table——the athletic

department could invest this money in other sports

that have been ignored in the past. The, Golden Pan-
thers have been good to the’ football team and
perhaps Mr. Myslinski could urge these alumni to be

more generous to other sports and less generous to in

football.

The continuation of our smaller sports teamsis
vital, if Pitt is to remain a first class school. In this
case it is necessary to spend a little money to maintain
a vital part of undergraduate education, and this
money may be readily available fromiour alumni if

the right word is whispered in their ea_r._

The recent round of laments for
lost idealism, occasioned by As-
sociate Dean Jack Daniel’s speech,
made life more interesting, but the
conclusions were excruciating ab-
stract. Daniel and The Pitt News
expressed their hopes. The latter
hopes for “a problem so large it
will awaken students.” If present
problems aren't big enough,
they’re sleeping the prover ial
sleep of the dead. The dean hopes
for “widespread efforts toward a
synergistic ‘development. of both

our affective and cognitive do-
mains.” Not all of his statement
was like that, but it’s language
which (if you’ll pardon a reversion
to the 60s style) makes me want to
reach for my revolver.

Anyway, the episode reminded
me of some unﬁnished business
relating to humanism and the
university. The last Student
Government Board ducked the
famous issue of university divest-
ment (of investments in South

Africa) by expressing doubts about
the merit of that action, even
flirting with the so-called “Sullivan
principles” by which corporations
were supposed to help overcome
a_parthied. Now, one idea still
persisting from the 60s, since it’s
constantly reinforced by. experi-
ence, is recognition of the fact that
such corporate benevolence falls in
the same category as unicorns and
the tooth fairy.

Energy Crisis Relates
To Social Problems

The Pitt News of Mar. 23
included two items which should be
read together, not separately. In
one, an associate dean of CAS
remarked on the necessity of
having our brightest people get to
work on major social problems,
among them the world energy
crisis. In the other, an ofﬁcial of
the Pittsburgh school‘ district
asked for university help in
handling desegregation.

The tendency is to look at energy
problems in the abstract, without
relating energy to the other issues
affected by energy. One such issue
is school bussing; it cannot be
constantly increased in the face of a
mounting energy crisis. I realize
that to say this is to immediately

become a target, for anyone who
raises any questions at all about
school bussing is usually branded
with one of the conventional titles
(“reactionary,” etc.).

The ultimate price of failing to
link energy with other problems
can be quite high. As I enter
Forbes. Quad every day, for
example, I am reminded that the
university despite the warning
implicit in the OPEC embargo of
1973, chose to install an expensive
escalator system that will probably
never by used. It may be the first
newly constructed monument to
energy. '

Wednesday, Aim: 4,l9:r9—Pag¢"7

This is in reference to the entire
Pitt News issue " published on
Monday, April 2, 1979. We think it
is about time that someone says

something about the poor news

judgment, inane editorials, and
tasteless editorial cartoons that are

the trademark of the student.

newspaper at Pitt.

On Saturday March 31, the first
Hand in Hand festival was held in
the Forbes Quadrangle Building.
The festival was to benefit the
handicapped and mentally retarded
children of Allegheny County. The
program was designed to introduce’
the students at Pitt to the
handicapped of the community
while providing a day of enjoyment
for the children. As a participant of
this program. We felt it was a
smashing success. The Pittsburgh
Press published an article concern-
ing Hand in Hand in their Monday
afternoon edition; they too, felt the

program was a great benefit to the
many children who attended.

Meanwhile, where was The Pitt
News? An event involving over two
hundred Pitt students is held over
the weekend and not one word of it
appears in the Monday edition of
the school newspaper. Well, The
Pitt News was too busy devoting
the entire front page and half of the
second page to the nuclear accident
at Three Mile Island.

Granted, the. Harrisburg story
is of great signiﬁcance to not only
the Pitt students, but the entire
country, yet I find it hard to believe
that the story of an elephant
stampeding and injuring eight is of
more importance than the Hand in
Hand festival. The elephant story,
along with other newsbriefs, made

me wonder if the staff of The Pitt '

News is capable of distinguishing
solid news from meaningless trivia.

by the way, where was the staff
that past weekend? All of your

news stories, with the exceptioncf
one, came off of the -AP wire.
Surely, you could have spared one
reporter to write about a campus
event as big as Hand in Hand.
Your editorial cartoon concern-
ing the accident at Three Mile
Island was another example of the

 sick sense of humor of the editorial

staff. That cartoon, along with the
thoughtless cartoon concerning the
Placement Center (Friday, March
16) were two glaring examples of
lack of intelligent consideration
given to important issues.

As for the editorials, they are
downright funny. We literally
laughed out loud at your editorial
concerning the dangers of nuclear
power. How any rational person
can take such a closed-minded view
of an obviously important and
viable source of power is beyond
us. We-are not condoning the
mistakes made at Three Mile

Island, but to say that the United
States must eliminate nuclear
power as a source of energy for the
future because of one accident is
absolutely asinine.

Unfortunately, the April 2nd
issue of The Pitt News is not an
exception. Throughout the year
the paper has printed many useless
articles that have wasted space and
ultimately students’ money.

We have had the opportunity to
read The Daily Texan, the school
paper at the University of Texas at
Austin, and The Collegian, Penn
State’s daily. When comparing
those two papers to The Pitt News,
we can clearly see ‘how far behind
The Pitt News really is. Not only
are The Daily Texan and The
Collegian well written, they are
published daily. We realize that
both Penn State and UT arelarger
schools than Pitt, yet we can’t

understand why a University as
large as Pitt can’t produce a
respectable college newspaper:
Perhaps The Pitt News should be
put on sale for a trial period of two
weeks, just to see if any of the
students would pay for it. We think
the editors and staff would have an
awful lot of newspapers on their

hands at the end of those two.

weeks. As Dave Hesidence wrote
inhis letter to the editor (March
26), Pitt students surely deserve
better.

Disappointment of Critic Not Shared by Loyal Stills Fan at Pitt

1, along with many others, was
amazed with Mr. Buffenmyer’s
review of the Stephen Stills shows
of March 24. I don’t think Mr.
Buffenmyer realized who it was he
was seeing! It’s apparent that Mr.

Buffenmyer went to see Stephen ~

Stills, the lead guitarist, vocalist
and ‘composer from CSN and Y,
Manassas and Buffalo Springﬁeld,
and not to see Stephen Stills was an
identity of his own. Stephen Stills

is much more than just a famous
guitarist from famous groups. He
is an accomplished guitarist in his
own right.

I, after reading his review, was
weary of Mr. Buffenmyer’s claim
that Stephen Stills’ “choice of
material was poor.” I wondered
justwhere and when Mr. Buffen-

lmyer accumulated the authority to

judge what Stephen Stills wants to
do for his own show.

Mr. Buffenmyer oversteps his
bounds again and also shows his
bias. toward Stills’ accomplish-
ments as a member of other famous
groups (none of whom were on the
Stanley’s stage Saturday night) by
stating that the banjo that was
brought on stage for the second
show encore “...nearly assured
‘Bluebird.’ ” But for the first show
Stills did play his banjo and chose
not to perform “Bluebird.”

Rats in Quadrangle Deplorable

After attending Pitt for four
years, I feel it is my personal duty
to bring a deplorable matter to the
attention of the university com-
munity. The problem is simply that
the Schenley Quadrangle is infest-
ed with rats. I think it is a disgrace
that the students in the surround-
ing dormitories pay high prices for
meager quarters and then end up
sharing their space with rats. The

problem is not a new one—the rat
holes have been hidden among the
plantings as long as I can
remember.

Although it is not comforting, I
can always count on my little furry
friends being there to greet me. I
have never seen any safeguards
initiated but Ithink it is time some
action is taken. Must a call be
placed to Wayne Van Dine, or

Cafeteria Ice Cream Progresses From Dip to Twist

Pitt student Joe Gadoaic helps himself to some ice cream at the cafeteria exit.
Blais photo

I scream, you scream, we all
scream for ice cream—or so the old
jingle goes.

Until this past January, Pitt
students had a choice of two scoops
of a wide variety of ﬂavors, all
doled out by work-study students in
cafeterias A and C or self-serve at
Lothrop. Now, the Towers have
tasti-freeze machines and Lothrop
is soon to follow suit according to
food service manager Ted Koklad-
1S.

“At first, we had students
operating the machines, just so
people could learn to get the hang
of using them,” said Kokladis.

“Now,_they just help themselves.”
Originally, one machine was

placed between cafeterias A and C.
A second one was added a few
weeks later—both serving vanilla
or chocolate ice milk or a
combination twists of both ﬂavors.
In February, a frozen yogurt
machine was added.

What ﬂavors do Pitt students
prefer?

“Chocolate in the ice cream and
strawberry in the yogurt,” Kok-
ladis said.

Kokladis termed the switch to
machines over hand dipped as
successful.

But for those who miss the
variety of butter brickle, rocky
road. blueberry cheesecake, pis-
tachio, sherberts and black cherry
—-and not knowing whether to ex-
pect the ice cream to be frozen hard
as an icicle or drippingly soft like
thick soup, take heart. There’s still
a few weeks left of the old way at
Lothrop.

Lab Theatre Adds Three Shows,
Pitt Tores "Kiss Me Frog"

The character Guildenstern gets rubbed out in Tom Stoppard’s play, but Pitt
professor Christopher Rawsen, who plays the role In the Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre presentation, got nosed out—Iiterai|y—when a freak accident
sidelined him and last weekend’s sell-out performances ot “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead.” Three extra performances have been added to make
up for the cancelled performances.

 

The Pittsburgh Laboratory The-
atre is presenting three additional
performances of Tom Stoppard’s
“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead” on April 11, 18 and 25.

The extra performances were
added to partially compensate for

—the cancellation of last weekend’s

sold out performances due to an
injury to a cast member.

Pitt professor Christopher Raw-
son, who plays Guildenstern,
suffered a broken nose while
playing squash last week, but the
play will resume Thursday as
scheduled.

“We strongly suggest that
people call us within the next five
days,” said Bill Royston, director
of the production. “We’re sold out
through April 20th.”

The next production for the Lab
Theatre will be “India Song,”
which was adapted from a
screenplay and will open May 11.

Pitt basketball fans were treated to a sneak peek of new recruits
Terry Knight, Larry Harris, and Melvin Bennett at the annual
Roundball Classic at the Civic Arena.

In other news, the president of Fraternal Association of Steel
Haulers (FASH), Willam Hill, announced the possibility of “one

versial “no fault” auto insurance bill.

TEN YEARS _AGO

About 150 people turned out at a rally in support of several
seniors and graduate students who had turned in their draft cards
(hopefully an occurrence that won’t be necesssary in the near
future). The group chanted folk songs and poetry in front of the

  Stanley Joins Ranks Of Top U.S. Concert Halls

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

The city of Pittsburgh has a history of
having the words “Number One”
attached to it somehow. Whether it’s the
Pirates in 1971, the Triangles in 1975, the ’
Pitt Panthers in 1976, r the Steelers in
1978—these two words seem to always
ﬁnd their way back here, like an old
friend.

And, with the naming of the Stanley
Theatre as the best concert facility for
1978 by “Billboard” magazine, the old
friend appears to have returned yet

 again.

Illfofﬁcel _.\¥_ear;End Awards for concert
‘"‘facilities‘*u'nﬂ€‘r"6,000 seats.’ = ‘T he Stanley

 

The Stanley in 1928...

was chosen as first for 1978, beating out '

such famous concert halls as California’s
Universal City Amphitheatre and New
York’s Palladium.

The Stanley was built in 1927, and
opened on February 27 of the following
year under the direciton of the Stanley
Corporation. The Stanley was advertised
as “Pittsburgh’s Palace of Amusement. ’ ’
Some of the famous stars that
have graced the stage include the Marx
Brothers, Frank Sinatra, Mickey Rooney,
the Ink Spots, Judy Garland, Nat King
Cole and the famed comedy team of

-Martin and Lewis.

In those days the Stanley represented
diverse types of entertainment, from

movie shows to dance
and off-Broadway
stage shows to musi-
cal performances.

‘In 1976 the Stanley
was purchased by
DiCesare-Engler Pro-
ductions, who then
began renovating the
theatre to restore its
original beauty, an
enterprise that cost
half a million dollars.

On February 7,
1976 the refurbished
theatre reopened.
Seating capacity was
3,500, and the inside
of the theatre was as
strikingly beautiful as
-it was in 1928. The
acoustics were still
considered by many to
be excellent.

You don’t have to
be good at math to see
that the Stanley just
celebrated its Golden
Anniversary last» year.
It is now dedicated, as
it always was, to “the

 

people in Pittsburgh and to the policy of
‘the ultimate in entertainment.”

But why did “Billboard” choose the
Stanley?

“ ‘Billboard’ picked the Stanley
Theatre for the number one theatre in the
country based on statistics, and (these)
statistics were taken from attendance and
(box office) grosses of theatres across the
country, dealing with concerts,” re-
sponded Rich Engler.

When asked if the Stanley’s famed
acoustics played a part in the selection,
Engler replied, “I think it was taken into
consideration. We were really surprised
about it (the award.) We didn’t set out to
break any records, especially the first
year in running the theatre.
game, and someone
called me from New
York and said ‘Hey, .
you guys scored real
big in Billboard, as
promoters number
two, and the Stanley
(as) number one.’ It
was just a total sur-
prise; of course we
were real happy and
proud of it.”

Engler defined the
DeCesare-Engler con-
cept of the Stanley
this way: “The Stan-
ley to us is something
where we could bring
a variety of talents to
the Pittsburgh mar-
ket, where one night
we can do a country
and western,.the next
night blues, the next
night soft rock, and
the next night heavy
rock, and all the way
down the line. We try
to /do that. We try to
bring (in) a wide
vareiety of talent for
different tastes of
music for Pittsburgh-

Billboard S

ers. Pittsburgh’s always been a good
entertainment town, and we felt that if we
give them (the people) top notch stuff in

' their certain category of their taste, they

would support us. And that we have
found to be fairly true.”

Is it true there are no bad seats here?

“What a lot of people don’t know is
that there are no bad seats in the theatre;
even if you sit in the very last seat all the
way up on top, that is not real bad. You
can still see and hear...(the) hearing is
excellent, the sightline is very good,
they’re all decent seats,” Engler
answered.

The Stanley Theatre sets Pittsburgh’s

standard for excellence. America, take
note. .

...and as it looks today.

‘New   Record Label Fights For Success In Fierce Market

By DAVID KOVACH W

_ The recordindustry is currently in a

j on o'perations while record prices

’ ﬁT” ‘ is
-. making an attempt to grab a piece of the

jffrecording industry’s proﬁts.

-.--» Inﬁnity Records is the brainchild of Ron
Alexenberg, the president‘ of the infant
7‘ _ lab_el_. Alexenberg had been wit,h___VCBS
Records organization for 13 years, where
he rose through the ranks to become head
of Columbia Records promotion depart-

ment and eventually senior vice president
of Epic, Portrait and Assorted Labels.

He left Epic in April 1978 to form the
Inﬁnity label through MCA,Inc.

“When the opportunity came up for me
to start something from scratch,”
Alexenberg said, “I met with the people
from MCA, Inc. They asked, ‘What do

‘you want to do?’ I said, ‘Well, maybe I'd

like to start my own record company and
they all said, ‘Well, how about that now?’
They’re very decisive people at MCA.”

Nothing very unusual so far. The twist in
the story is in the immediate success of
the new label.

The first album release on Inﬁnity, Hot
Chocolate’s “Every 1’s a Winner” made
[116 national top ten charts in various
musical categories. Hot Chocolate is sort
of a soul band, which means in recent
years it’s been sort of a disco band. One
of the band's singles, “You Sexy Thing,”
made an impact on U.S. charts 111 1975.
“Every 1's a Winner" blends bouncy
disco tunes. slower ballads and reggae in
a most appealing way.

Another of the hot initial releases is
Robert Johnson's “Close Personal

Friend.” This album also made a national
impact and was a smash on college radio.
Johnson’s a Memphis, Tennessee native
and former session guitarist there. His
ﬁngers sparked the snappy licks on Isaac
Hayes’ “Theme From Shaft.” Johnson's
first solo album consists of basic 50s-type
rock n’ roll with a contemporary
production job, also by Johnson. But it’s
the bust-head guitar playing that really
makes this album so magnificent. It's
quite a unique combination!

Another new act on Inﬁnity is the
heavyweight band TKO. They are
managed and produced by Ken Kinnear
and Mike Flicker, who handle the same
duties for Heart. TKO’s first LP, “Let It
Roll,” is a very powerful rocker with a
sound very reminiscent of the early Who.
Lead vocalist Brad Sinsel is a dead ringer
for the Who’s Roger Daltry! Expect to

Leonard Nimoy Brings» ‘Vincent’ To Pittsburgh

Leonard Nimoy as Theo, Vincent Van Gogh’s brother.

By MARK HOLAN

Leonard Nimoy was in Pittsburgh
Monday night to do a special beneﬁt
performance of “Vincent,” a multi-image
dramatic production based on the play
“Van Gogh” by Phillip Stephen.

Presented by Pittsburgh Public Theater,
Nimoy appeared solo in the performance,
which he also wrote and directed.
Nimoy’s play, coupled with his undisput-
ably professional stage presence, could
only be described as being beautifully
enlightening.

“Vincent” is an introspective look at one
of the world’s greatest and most
misunderstood artists—-Vincent Van
Gogh. It is a narrative related through
Van Gogh’s brother Theo.

The play is highly successful in shedding
insight on the life of this tragic artist
without becoming overbearing or de-
pressing.

To do this, Nimoy employs several
audio-visual techniques. Throughout
most of the performances drawings,
paintings and letters of Van Gogh were
shown on two large screens set at slight
angles, one image softly fading into the
next. ,

Also, tape recordings of Nimoy’s voice
reading passages of letters from Van
Gogh to his brother were used to
represent Theo’s reflections and the song
“Vincent” by Don McLean was used to
open the second act.

Nimoy has employed these devices
tastefully. They do not distract, but rather
enhance the audiences’ understanding of
the artist. ‘

And after all, what better way is there to
understand an artist than to view his
work?

In the first act, Theo relates the bulk of
his brother's short life to the audience,
telling them of Vincent's religious zeal
and of his brief career as an evangelist to
the coalminers at Wasmes.

It was after he was rejected by the
church clergy that Van Gogh became
serious about becoming an artist. In 1880
he wrote to his brother, “I am taking up
my pencil again, I am putting myself to
drawing anew and since then everything
for me has changed."

Theo also sheds light on Vincent’s two
love affairs; one with his cousin Kee, who
later rejects him, and the other with
a prostitute whom he left after a year.

The ﬁrst act ends with” the impassioned
tale of how Vincent, after a violent
quarrel with his artist friend Gauguin, cut
off his ear and gave it to a prostitute to
guard.

Nimoy potrayed Theo as a loving,
though sardonic, brother in the ﬁrst act.
His mood changed in the second act,
however, and he becomes more sympa-
thetic and defensive of Vincent.

More like a brief epilogue, in the second
act Theo tells of how his brother was
institutionalized for madness (which was
later diagnosed as epilepsy) and how he
ﬁnally committed suicide by shooting
himself in the breast.

The details of the funeral are especially
sad, considering that Van Gogh had
always loved and served God but would
not be recognized by the church because
he had taken his own life.

It is unfortunate that Nimoy and his play
could only be in town for one night. The
performance was an enlightening tour-de
-force. a

City Theater Co. Has Hilarious ‘Table Manners’

By MICHAEL MCCABE

Table Manners
Directed by Mark Lione
City Theatre Company

“Table Manners” is a genuinely funny
marital comedy. This alone makes the
play enjoyable. But what makes it really
absorbing is that there is more substance
beneath the comic surface for those who
care to look deeper.

“Table Manners” is taken from a
trilogy called “The Norman Conquests.”
The author, Alan Ayckbourn, is one of
Britain's most popular comedy play-
wrights. "

Randell Haynes plays Norman, a
lustful librarian saddled with a cold
businesswoman wife. Norman’s
advances towards his wife's sister Annie
are the main topic of the play.

Annie, played by Jennifer Johanos, is a
young unmarried woman who lives at
home caring for her mother. Norman and
Annie have planned a weekend
rendezvous, but before he can whisk her
away to a hotel room his other
sister-in—law arrives and discovers their
plans. As a result, é:'w.:~ryone winds up

spending the weekend together at the
house.

Norman is a bit of a lunatic. All of the
characters are~.eccentric in some way or
another but Norman’s madness is the
most exaggerated. It has a different
source.

While the madness of the others is
caused by their faults, Norman’s lunacy is
the product of his major virtue, his relish
for life and love. Though his existance is
rooted in the bourgeois world, he tries
desperately to experience life fully.

As the one character who is fairly sane,
Annie falls prey to the eccentricities of all
the others. Johanos portrays her
innocence well and succeeds in evoking
the sympathy that should be felt for her.

Nathaniel Ritch’s talents as a mime
make him especially suited for the role of
Tom. An affable yet extremely
dull-witted veterinarian, Tom seems to
have a romantic interest in Annie, but no
one is too sure about this—least of all
Tom himself. The reserved and
unobtrusive Tom has relatively few lines,
still Ritch is able to convey this character -.,
very effectively by his mere presence on
stage; with his stance, movements and
fa.ci:1l expressions.

“’l3.'xble Manners is being produced by

The City Theatre Company, which is
sponsored by the City of Pittsburgh
Department of Parks and Recreation.

superb acting by Sally Fields helps make “Norma Rae” a better film.

Good Acting Helps Save
  Mediocore ‘Norma Rae’

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Norma Rae
Directed by Martin Ritt
20th Century Fox

“Norma Rae” is a story about a
woman's growth and development as a
person and while this theme has been
played out before——and better'— in
vehicles like “An Unmarried Woman,”
“Norma Rae” is unpretentiously poig-
nant through superior acting byJSa1ly
Field (as the title character)"af1\d Beau
Bridges (as her husband){ transcend
the script. _‘

Norma Rae is an uneducated young
factory worker who ﬁnds a mentor in a
dynamic and brash" New Yorker (Ron
Leibman). Field, late of a string of
implistic television shows like “The
Flying Nun” and a line of third rate Burt
Reynolds’ movies where she either
played spunky and cutesy heroines or
spunky and cutesy girlfriends, proved
herself a dynamic actress when the script
was superior (as in “Sybil” and “Stay
Hungry”) but she proves her talent even
more dramatically here because she takes
Norma Rae beyond hervsoggyf cracker
outlines and turns her into a believable
person. /

And the reality of Norma Rae’s world is
grippingly credible—sm_all town stereo-
typic southern attitudes. The jocular,
good ole boy culture is detailed in a deftly
drawn portrait by Bridges. So good and

‘ so often under-rated, Bridges is strong,

subtle and convincing as a husband who
sees his wife changing and while he is
incapable of growing himself, he
acknowledges her development with an
almost eloquent nonverbal expression.

Liebman, whose metallic voice tinged *

with Brooklynes-e slices through the warm
syrupy drawls of the rest of the cast with
the impact of a news ﬂash cutting into a
country western station on the radio,
comes off stagey and tense and studied.
His character is supposed to contract but
the difference does not mesh well.
Instead of being electric, he comes across
as a bad and unexpected shock from the
force of his portrayal.

One can see how a friendship could

~-strikeup between Liebman and Field,

though,‘ and why romance would never
work. He lacks the understated, natural
appeal of Field. and Bridges.

There are no new messages in “Norma
Rae.” It’s not even so much a “women’s
film” as a ﬁlm about people. Rate it on
plot alone and “Norma Rae” is mediocre.
But rate it for the acting and “Norma
Rae” is superlative.

Film Version  ‘Hair’ Untrue To Original Stage Show

By MARK HOLAN

Hair
Directed by Milos Forman
United Artists

Before going to see “Hair," ask
yourself this question: What is a 1969
stage show about hippies, free love,
drugs, and Viet Nam doing on the screen
in 1979?

Some possible answers would be:

a)_ making money for Hollywood

b) saving screen writers from thinking
up new ideas

c) romanitcizing the ’60s

cl) letting the sun shine in (again), or

e) I don't know---good question.

The best answer would be choice c.
The new ﬁlm version of “Hair” is a

glossy, cleaned-up and unauthentic relic
of America’s most turbulent decade.

What, had been a classic and
controversial statement on stage is now
mediocore and light fare on screen.
“Hair” had originally represented the
sincere and often painful vortex of many
peoples’ lives. Now it is an unserious and
fun tangent for everybody.

Director Milos Forman (One Flew Over
The Cuckoo’s Nest) and his producers
probably didn’t_ downplay “Hair” on
purpose. Why, ‘after all, should they get
uptight about a war that’s been over for
seven years and a sub-culture that has all
but vanished?

But this only brings us back to the
original question. Why do “Hair” in
1979? .

Like “Grease,” “Hair” is a nostalgia

ﬂick that romanticizes a past decade. The
major difference, however, is that
“Grease” was not an original product of
the decade it reﬂected.

The ﬁlm “Hair,” then, is more like the
recent ﬁlm production of “Sergeant
Pepper”; a highly stylized, 70s version of
a 60s relic. The smoothing out of rough
edges takes away much, if not all, of the
original impact..

To Forman’s credit, “Hair” does not
use big name stars. (John Savage, who
appears in “The Deer Hunter,” being the
exception.) One can only imagine with
consternation what “Hair” would be like
with John Travolta cast as lead
ﬂower-child Berger, played nicely by
Treat Williams.

Musically, the ﬁlm has shortened many

of the song's from the stage version and
eliminated others entirely. While not
disco, the songs seem to have lost much
of the rock ﬂavor they originally had.
Highlights include Ren Wood's solo on

. “Aquarius” and Cheryl Barnes singing

“Easy To Be Hard.”

The choreography, although somewhat
haphazard, is still colorful and entertain-
ing. The autumn scenes in Central Park
are especially good.

“Hair” will probably only have a short
run at movie theaters. It will disappear
for a while and then resurface on
television. One can only hope that twenty
years from now when it is used to ﬁll in
late night air time that someone will be
around to tell the unborn generation that
the ’60s really weren’t so frivolous.

Engineers Determine

By The Associated Press
The Three Mile Island plant
wasn’t designed for a bubble in its
reactor, and engineers had to use
indirect methods to measure it.
Here’s how it was done:

—Boyle’s law says if you
put pressure on a gas
kept at constant temper-
ature, it will shrink
proportionately to the
pressure.

-—If you add a known
quantity of water to a
closed system, you can
predict how much the
pressure should go up.

  p Extent of Bubble

pressure and shrank the bubble in

\ the pressurizer. A

But engineers were able to
compare how much the pressurizer
bubble actually shrank with how
much it should have shrunk, based
on the known quantity of water that
was injected. By comparing those
two ﬁgures, they could guess at the
size of the hidden bubble, which
was shrinking elsewhere in the
system and absorbing some of the
added pressure.

It was only a guess. That was
why the measurement slopped up
and down for several days, and
federal officials said any one
measurement could be off by as
much as 100 cubic feet.

—Finally, there were
actually two bubbles in
the Three Mile’ Island
reactor. One was in the
reactor core and could not
be measured. But the
other was in a part of the
system called the pres-
surizer, which is built for
such a bubble and equip-
ped to measure it.

Can Rosey Philadelphia Pass the Bucs?

This is the last in a series of
articles by The Pitt News sports
writers previewing the major
league baseball season. Today: the
National League East.

= ByMARIASCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor

“I’d say the Phillies are the best
team in the league now because
they have me. If the Pirates had
me, they’d be the best team.”

What Pete Rose lacks in
humility, he makes up in his
trademark, hustle. "While Rose
could be a thorn in the Pirates’ side
this season, the Phillies would be
wise to downplay Charlie Hustle’s
importance. If, as Rose believes,
the main difference between
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia is
himself, then don’t look for a
runaway in the National League

East. At 37, Rose willtry to play
the Dave Cash inspiration role and

may eat his words.

’It again will be a two-team race
in‘the East, with Montreal lurking
close by. The Phillies are a team of
somnambulous talent and with
Dave Parker, Pittsburgh’s $5
million man, Philadelphia may not
pass the Bucs this year.

PITTSBURGH

The Pirates overcame the disap-
pointing performance of lefty John
Candelaria and the crazy shifting of
their inﬁeld players to storm back
in the final week of the 1978
season. Parker’s MVP award was
well-deserved, but he must now
come close to his ’78 totals of .334
batting average, 30 homers and 117_
RBIs if Pittsburgh is to recapture
the East pennant.

Candelaria has regained form
and will be joined by young Don

-Robinson and Bert Blyleven (who

has ﬁnally gotten used to the
National League strike zone) to
form the heart of a fairly
impressive pitching staff. Again,
bony Kent Tekulve will be called
upon to bail out the Pirates. He had
31 saves last year. Left-handed
Enrique Romo is a new addition to
the Pittsburgh bullpen.

Although the “Lumber Comp-
any” no longer exists in that only
Parker and Willie Stargell are real
home run threats, the “Lightning”
remains. If Omar Moreno could
bat as well as he runs, baseball
would have another .400 hitter.
Alas, Moreno’s league-leading 71
steals was offset by his quiet bat.
Another big “if” is second

When the dust clears this summer, Pittsburgh may be back at the top.

baseman Rennie Stennett, whose
remarkable inﬁeld and batting
abilities were hidden beneath
injuries for two seasons. Outﬁelder
Lee Lacy, however, former Dodger-
turned-free agent, is just what the
Bucs needed to compliment Parker.

PHILADELPHIA

Will Pete Rose spark the Phillies
into the World Series? Will Mike
Schmidt and Greg Luzinski bounce
back after a mediocre 1978 season?
Will Philadelphia’s players employ
some brotherly love among them-
selves and keep the team from
self-destructing?

If the answer is yes, then the
Phillies could bring home the world
championship. The talent is there,
but displays of it were rare last
season. Philadelphia will need
good seasons from Schmidt,
Luzinski and Rose if it is to survive
the determined efforts of Pitts-
burgh and Montreal.

Shortstop Larry Bowa, not Rose

may prove the key to the Phillies’
season. Bowa batted .294 and
while he is a singles hitter, his Gold
Glove is a reassuring presence in
the inﬁeld. _

Richie Hebner was traded to the
Mets in order to clear the way for
Rose, and former Cub Manny Trillo
is an important addition at second
base.

TheiPhillie pitching staff is led
by old-timers Steve Carlton, Jim
Kaat and Jim Longborg, who, at
34, 40 and 35 years old will battle
out the starting positions with
youngsters Dick Ruthven, Randy
Lerch and Larry Christenson.

Philadelphia won’t' be able to
sleep-walk its way to the playoffs
this season, but if Rose’s ability to
spark the team is anywhere as big
as his ego, it just may be four in a
row for Philadelphia.

MONTREAL

Montreal has long been a
way-station for much-traded base-

ball players, but here manager
Dick Williams has found a home.

Williams has the difﬁcult task of
piecing together a group of players,
many of whom were apathetic
about the team’s chances last
season, into a team capable of
withstanding the onslaughts of
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The
NL East is the weaker of the two
divisions, if one compares the
Expos to the West’s probable
third-place ﬁnisher, Cincinnati.

The Expos will rely upon
comebacks by inﬁelders Dave Cash
andcatcher Gary Carter plus the_
pitching of Ross Grimsley. The
Montreal outﬁeld shows the most
potential, however, where Ellis
Valentine (.289, 25 homers), Andre
Dawson and Warren Cromartie
(.297, 10 homers) may be the
premier outﬁeld of the future.

Unfortunately, Montreal needs
premier performances right now.

ST. LOUIS

It’s difﬁcult to chose either St.
Louis or Chicago as the fourth-
place ﬁnisher but the Cardinals get
the nod because of an important
acquisition; a new general mana-
ger. .
John Claiborne spent the off-
season looking for
pitchers and came up with Bob
Sykes and John Murphy, although
~Murphy will probably serve bull-
pen duty.

Shortstop Garry Templeton, vic-
tim of the infamous “sophomore
jinx,” is young enough (23) to
rebound from a subpar 1978
season.

Catcher Ted Simmons and
outﬁelder George Hendrick were
among the Cards’ batting leaders.
In fact, Simmons’ .287 average, 22
home runs and 80 RBI were top for
St. Louis.

Pitching is still a problem,
however. Silvio Martinez, Bob
Forsch and Mark Littell are the
returning stars.

Leftﬁelder Lou Brock (.221, 0
homers, 12 RBI) is obviously not
the player he used to be.

CHICAGO

Once upon a time when Chicago

played well and stayed in the East’

pennant race, it was always a sure
thing the Cubs would fold down the
stretch.

Now Chicago doesn’t wait for
September. Although the Cubs’

roster includes a few once-feared 3

names such as Bobby Murcer and
Dave Kingman, the team will be in
a sticky situation at Wrigley Field.

Manny Tri_llo is gone, but the
Cubs have acquired the catcher
they desperately needed in Barry
Foote.

Last year, Chicago’s pitching
was ineffective, to say the least. It
won’t_be muchfbetter this season if
ace Rick Reuschel (14-15, 3.41
ERA) doesn’t regain his 20-game
winning form. Reliever Bruce
Sutter will also have to be

consistant if the Cubs are to keep ‘

out of the division basement.

Bowie, Anderson, Vamer Head All-Pennsylvania Team

By The Associated Press .

PHILADELPHIA——Sam Bowie of
Lebanon, recognized recently by
the NCAA as the outstanding high
school player of the year, was the
top choice for the Associated Press
1978-1979 All-State Basketball
Team. »

Sports writers, radio and televi-
sion sports directors, and college
recruiters named Larry Anderson
of Pittsburgh Schenley; Damon
Bryant of Beaver Falls; Billy
Varner of Valley, and Horace

Owens of Dobbins Tech Phila. as
Bowie’s teammates on the ﬁrst
All-Star unit.

Bowie, whose coach, Chic Hess,
disclosed that his 7-foot, 1-inch
center would sign a letter of intent
to attend Kentucky, is described by
most as the type of player who can
turn a program around.

Hess said that Bowie, a
17-year-old born and bred in the
Central Pennsylvania Dutch com-
munity of Lebanon, had more

potential at this stage than Wilt
Chamberlain, Bill Russell or
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

Bowie’s only weakness, accord-
ing to Hess, is that everything
connected with basketball comes
too easy to the genial giant.

Bowie isn't just a “Big Man” in
the sense of the words. He’s not a‘
basket hanger taking advantage of
his height. He’s well coordinated,
shoots 20-to 25-foot jump shots
with the soft touch of an outside

shooter, and has been used to bring
the ball across the center line like a
guard. ‘

Bowie averaged 28 points and 18
rebounds per game, and defensive-
ly blocked 160 shots. He earned
the reputation as an intimidator.
Some 400 colleges tried to recruit
him, and it came down to
Marquette, Nevada-Las Vegas and
Kentucky. Hess said Kentucky
won Bowie because the Southeast-
ern Conference university met all
the things the honor student

wanted in a higher institution of
learning.

The 6-7 Anderson averaged‘ 26
points and grabbed 15 rebounds
per game. He shot 50 percent from
the ﬁeld and 90 percent at the foul
line. Bryant, 6-3, is a smooth ball
handler with quick moves who shot
at a 19.9 point clip, handed out 142
assists and made 86 steals.

Owens, 6-4, was rated the best
all-around player in Philadelphia,
the state’s largest city.

  Pittcatcher Pastin 
Tries to Find Hot Bat

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Panther starting catcher Jim
Pastin was angry with himself
following Thursday’s doubleheader
sweep over Carnegie-Mellon.

“Never in my life have I struck
out four times in a game,”
explained the sophomore from
McKees Rocks. “Once, in a high
school game, I struck out three
times.

“I was struggling Thursday,”
added Pastin, who was among the
team leaders in home runs, runs
batted in and extra base hits last
season. “Usually, I can go six or
seven games without striking out,
but when the strikeouts do come, I
start pressing and end up striking
out more.” .

Pastin, who has been taking
extra batting practice, believes it’s
too early to worry about a hitting
slump.

“I’m a slow starter,” the catcher
said. “I know that’s a poor excuse,
but I really do need a lot of batting
in games before I start hitting well.

“We played some intrasquad
games, butl need to play against
other people, other teams, to start

hitting. The competition’s not

there in an intrasquad game.”
The Panthers (2-0) should hope

Pastin is right. They can’t afford to

have one of their top .hitters in as 

prolonged slump.
“I learned something Thursday
and that’s to never get down on

myself,” Pastin said. “Some- Ml:

times, my temper gets the best of
me and I press.

“I knew after my ﬁrst strikeout .

Thursday, I kept wondering, ‘What
if I do it again?’ I have to quit
thinking that way. I have to be

more conﬁdent and relaxed at the 

plate.”

“Jimmy is kind of upset with the
way he did today,” Pitt coach
Bobby Lewis said Thursday. “But

give him time and he’ll do all 

right.”

doubleheader at Robert Morris was

  Pitt Sprinter Leckenby
En joys Anchor Position

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Sprinter Keith Leckenby had the
job of anchoring three Pitt relays
last weekend at the University of
Virginia Invitational.

“Running the last leg makes you
a lot more evident to everyone,”
Leckenby said, “because there
isn't any more hope after you. It’s
all up to you to bring it home.”

Leckenby anchored the 440-,
800- and mile relays for the
Panthers. He has come a long way
since his days at nearly South Hills
Catholic, where he began running
on a cinder track. Leckenby started
to run track competitively his
sophomore year and lost only a few
races" in his junior and senior
seasons. These performances were
what made Pitt coach Mike
Agostinella recruit him.

“When we recriuted Keith, we
did it because of the potential that
we thought he had,” said
Agostinella. “When he came, he
was an average high school runner
‘but all his work has paid off. He
has developed into an excellent
runner. I

Leckenby has shared in a lot of
track successes at Pitt. His
freshman year, he helped the mile

relay team to United States Track
and Field Federation (USTAFF)
Mid-Atlantic championship, an
accomplishment that meant a lot to
him.

“I was able to run on the mile
relay team my freshman year with
Karl Farmer (a former Pitt football
and track star who has since turned
professional in football). This had
to be the highlight of  ﬁrst
year.”

His sophomore season, Leckenby
anchored the 440-relay team to a
school record with a time 41.4.
Then, the next year he anchored
the 880-relay team to another
school record, (1:28.0). -

“Keith is the only senior on the
relay teams,” said Agostinella.”
His anchoring the teams adds
maturity and stability.

“Last year,” he continued,
“Keith had amile relay split time
of 47.1. This year, we’re looking
forward to the start of the outdoor
season tomorrow and believe that it
will be a good one.

“Keith recorded his lifetime best
relay split indoor this year,” said
Agostinella. “Based on this, and
the condition he is in, I think he
should have an excellent season.”

-Reds-Giants, Man'ners-Angels Open League Play Today

Hoping to duplicate last year’s

, success story when a record of
‘ more than 40 million fans jammed

ball parks in the United States and
Canada, major league baseball
opens its 1979 season Wednesday.

There is one game scheduled in

each league, with more than 52,000
fans expected at Riverfront Stad-
ium in Cincinnati to watch the Reds
face the San Francisco Giants in the
National League opener, and
35,000 anticipated in Seattle’s
Kingdome for the Mariners’

American League opener against
the California Angels.

Tom Seaver will open for the
Reds against the Giants’ Vida Blue
in a duel of two of the NL’s top
pitchers. Seaver posted a 16-14
record with a 2.87 earned run

penthouse to the outhouse.” It’s
hard to imagine New York as the
Amazing Mets of only a decade
ago. Impossible, in fact.

New York was almost last in both

,1 the pitching and batting league
‘ standings in 1978. Many believe its

problems stem not from a lack of
talent (although there is one) but
‘he bumbling front office manage-

ment of ex-chairman of the board,
M. Donald Grant.

‘Of all cities, New York should be
able to attract free agents with
lucrative contracts but the Mets
were too stingy over the winter.

Catcher Johnny Stearns and
outﬁelders Lee Mazzilli and Steve
Henderson are coming off medi-
ocre 1978 seasons, but may spark
their team with hitting because the
Mets’ pitching sure won’t. Never

having recovered from the loss of
Tom Terrifﬁc and Jerry Koosman,
the best Met fans can hope for is
another good year from Craig
Swan, who led the league with a
2.43 ERA last year.

According to The Pitt News
sports writers, it will be Los
Angeles versus Pittsburgh and
New York against California in the
playoffs this fall.

average for th Reds last season
while Blue was 18-10 for the Giants
with a 2.79 ERA in 1978.

For the Reds, it will be the start
of a new era with John McNamara
replacing popular Sparky Anderson
as manager of the team and Pete
Rose, a Cincinnati star for 16
seasons, moving on to Philadelphia
via the free-agent route.

Both Cincinnati and San Fran-
cisco hope to overhaul the Los
Angeles Dodgers, who have
captured two straight National
League pennants under Manager
Tom Lasorda. No NL manager has
ever won pennants in each of his
first three seasons and Lasorda will
be trying to accomplish that feat
this year.

The Dodgers will raise the NL

ﬂag Thursday in Los Angeles with
either Don Sutton or Burt Hooton
pitching against Gaylord Perry,
San Diego’s Cy Young Award
winner last season. Thursday’s
other NL opener ﬁnds the New
York Mets at Chicago with Craig
Swan, the league leader in ERA
last season, facing Rick Reuschel of
the Cubs. I

Just as the Reds and Giants hope
to overhaul the Dodgers in the NL
West, California has the same kind
of ambition in the AL West. The
Angels added perennial batting
champion Rod Carew over the
winter and will open at Seattle with
Frank Tanana, who was 18-12 with
a 3.65 ERA last season. Glenn
Abbott, 7-15 with a 5.28 ERA, will
start for the Mariners.
