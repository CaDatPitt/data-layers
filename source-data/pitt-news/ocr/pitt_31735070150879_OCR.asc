Charges
  against
A g athletes
dropped

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor‘ ‘

Allegheny County has dropped
charges against current and for-
mer Pitt football players. Atthe
time of their arrest, the two men
were charged with possession of
drug paraphernalia. ‘
Khaynin Mosley—Smith, Eric
Williams and Andrew Carswell
—- all of whom played football
for Pitt at the time — received
summonses late in April when
police raided a South Oakland
house where another man was
allegedly selling heroin.
Williams and Carswell were
dismissed from the football
team the week following the in-
cident, while Mosley—Smith has
been suspended from playing.

However, the district attorney ‘

has now dropped the charges
against Mosley—Smith and Wil-
liams.

Mike Manko, a spokesman

for the district attorney’s of— '

ﬁce’, said that the district at-
torney had an agreement with
all three players, stating that if
they completed 20 hours of com-
munity service, they would not
go to trial for the paraphernalia
charges. A’

Mosley—Smith and Williams
were due to appear in court for
preliminary hearings at 8 a.m.
Wednesday but neither showed
up.

Mosley—Smith arrived at the
courthouse later in the day and
presented a letter that showed
he had completed his service

DA not to press charges over Oakland death

Aaron Stier-Cohen
Staff Writer

The Allegheny County District
Attorney’s Office announced
yesterday that it will not pursue
criminal charges in the death of
a 22-year-old Penn State student
who died two months ago after
an accident in Central Oakland.

Cody Barrasse died after an
April 6 hit-and-run on Bates
Street in Central Oakland. After
investigating the incident, the
Allegheny County District At-
torney’s Office decided against

pressing charges Wednesday.

According to the Allegheny
County District Attorney’s Of-
ﬁce, evidence in the case includ-
ed video footage from cameras
close to the incident and several
interviews with those involved.

“Our office has concluded, at
this time, that the circumstances
do not merit criminal charges
against anyone who was present
at the time of the accident,” the
office said in a press release it
issued Wednesday.

Mike Manko, spokesman for
the Allegheny County District

Attorney’s Office, said he had

no further comment on the in-
vestigation.
According to police reports,

‘ Barrasse’s friends were with him

when the accident occurred, and
they claimed that the driverehit
Barrasse intentionally.

The driver of the vehicle later
reported to police that he slowed
down when he saw Barrasse and
his two friends in the street. Ac-
cording to the driver, the three
pedestrians then encircled the
car and began pounding on the
hood and roof and even

 

began to open the car door.

But, according to police
spokeswoman Diane Richard,
the district attorney’s office and
Pittsburgh police have been in
close contact throughout the
investigation.

Anthony Bofo, a forensic su-
pervisor at the medical exam-
iner’s office, said that, despite
the district attorney’s announce-
ment, the medical examiner’s
office -is carrying on with the
forensic investigation into Bar-
rasse’s death.

Young]eezy’s voice blared from the
speakers ﬂanking the stage while
contestants made their way to their
respective positions, preceded by
announcements of their names,
nicknames and cities of residence.
Competitive eaters hailingfrom Sum-
mit, N.]., Germantown, Md., Toledo,
Ohio, New York City and various
other locales readied themselves on
the dais, which had fastened to it a
bannerthat read “Nathan’s Hot Dog
Eating Contest.”

“I put on for my city, on on for my
city,” continued the booming voice
on the speakers. And not long after,
“Big” Brian Subich made his way to
the stage’s steps, stopping halfway

to raise his arm and let out a cry for g

the city of Pittsburgh, which, in turn,

1 electriﬁed the eating contest’s crowd

and left them cheering.

Subich and his peers, which in-
cluded both renowned and obscure
competitive eaters, traveled to the
City of Champions last Wednesday
afternoon to face off in the qualify-
ing round of Nathan’s Hot Dog Eat-
ing Contest in an effort to win a spot

at the national competition July 4..

“It’s sort of a surreal scene. You just
can’t imagine that 40,000 people are
going to show up to watch you eat a
hot dog,” said Subich in a phone call
with The Pitt News the day before
last Wednesday‘s contest. “But that’s
what they do.”

Subich, a 6—foot—6, 325—pound,
39-year-old from Johnstown, Pa.,
hoped that he would emerge from

Competitive eaters clash
to become topdog,  
advance to ﬁnal round     

last Wednesday’s competition 4 his
10th Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest
— as the victor, as he did in qualify-
ing rounds in both 2006 and 2011,

‘ both of which earned him a spot at

the national contest. , . ,

‘‘It’s unb___elie;zable,” Subich-said.
“You walk out, and you’re treated like
arock star.’-’. '

Subich has competed in contests
for 10 years and said that his career
as a professional eater actually started
when he madeabet withaco-worker:
Whoever ate McDonald’s double
cheeseburgers more quickly would
win $20. Subichﬁnished three of the
burgers in about a minute ﬂat, which
“blew [his co-worker] away.”

Since then, Subich has competed
in eating competitions 'of various
sorts, ingesting not only hot dogs,
but wings, apples and many other
foods at breakneck speeds.

In between competitions, he holds “’
himselfto a daily ﬁtness regimen that

includes stair stepping and elliptical
machines, and he also tries to stick to
a healthy diet. According to Subich,
many people don’t believe that he and
other professional eaters try to stay
in shape, but he warned that without
diet and exercise, he “would be twice
as big as [he] is now.”

Subich describes his wife and his
son, Nick, as his two biggest support-
ers, sayingthat his son shows himthe
type of tough love that’s necessary to
motivate him.

“If you stand right in front [of the
stage] tomorrow, you’ll hearhimyell-
ing at me like he’s a drill instructor,”
said Subich.

Both Subich and his son attributed

V the relationship they foster through

competition to their experiences
on the football ﬁeld, where Subich
coaches his son’s high school team.

“I’m gonna do the same thing for 1

him that he does for me,” said Subich’s
son. “He pushes me, and I’m gonna
push him.” '

And last Wednesday, he did just
that.

As children gawked at the men
and women on stage, who were de-
vouring piles of hot dogs stacked like
Lincoln Logs, Subich’s son looked
up to his father on the stage above
and out-shouted the crowd with the
amount of time remaining, his op-
ponents’ scores and words of encour-
agement.

Subich ultimately did not win the
competition and tied with another
participant for second-place male
eater, downing 20 hot dogs and fall-

ing short ofvictor Marcos Owens’ 30
hot dogs in 10 minutes. But despite
failing to bring home the gold, Team
Subich is still focused on the future.
Immediately after. the competi-

tion, Subich’s son said that his father
would now start to prepare himself
for the Hooters World Wing Eating
Championship, a competition that
Subich qualiﬁed for after eating 120
wings in 10 minutes at a Cincinnati

qualifying round.
" But following the competition,‘ »

Subich said that many participants
planned to meet at Primanti Brothers
to relax and socialize.

“I always get butterflies before
these competitions, just like when I
played afootball game. I feel nervous,
anxious and just want to get to i ,”
said Subich, welcomingthe chance to
unwind with the fellow competitors,
many of whom he considers close

 
    

, friends. -

Subich said that he tells people
that he and the competitive eaters are
“friends all of tlie time, except for the
10 minutes when we’re enemies.” But,
he said, the eaters are quick to revert
back to their amicable states post-

1 competition, and he also says that

describing the atmosphere after the
contestas one of good sportsmanship
would hardly do it justice.

“That’s the nice thing about this
sport,” said Subich after the event,
“and that’s why I’ve been doing it for
10 years.” "

Owens, who will advance to the ﬁ-

nal round of Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating “

Contest onjuly4withJuliet Lee, who
also ate 30 hot dogs at the competi-
tion, echoed Subich’s sentiments and
describedthe group of competitive
eaters as a close—knit bunch.
“It’s like one big, weird family.”

Online classes linked to poor retention, performance  

Katherine Long
M CT Campus

SEATTLE _ It’s one of the most hyped
ideas in higher education today — the
hope that college courses taught online
will drive down the cost of a degree and
make it easier for working students to
complete their college educations.

But a new study comparing the success
rates of online and traditional courses
taught in Washington state’s community
colleges shows that more students drop‘
out and fewer receive a passing grade
when they take a class online rather than
when they take it in a classroom.

The students who fare the worst in the
study are those who are already strug-
gling in college, which raises the possi-
bility that a push formore online classes
could exacerbate the higher—education
achievement gap.

The study was done by the Community
College Research Center at Teachers Col-
lege, Columbia University, at the request
of Washington’s community colleges.

The data included results from
500,000 courses taken by 40,000 stu-
dents over four years, tapping into “a
strong and robust data system” the state
keeps on its success rates in community
colleges, said Shanna Smithjaggars, as-

A Washington study linked online class enrollment to poor academic performance.

MCT Campus

sistant director of the research center.
Smithjaggars, who was one of the study’s
authors, said many previous studies com-
paring online and in—class course success
have been limited in scope, usually only

comparing the results of a single course '

taught in-person at a four—year college to
the same course taught online.
Those studies often show that online
is just as good as in-person, she said.
But the study of_Washington’s com-
munity colleges — in comparison to the

 

study of Virginia’s -— is much broader
because it analyzes a whole system over
an extended period of time, she said.

It found that males, black students and
students with lower levels of academic
preparation were the ones most likely
to fail to ﬁnish a class or receive a lower
grade. Those groups already have lower
performance levels in college, and the
gaps worsened in online courses.

“If this pattern holds true across other
states and educational sectors, it would
imply that the continued expansion of
online learning could strengthen, rather
than ameliorate, educational inequity,”
the study says.

“The main thing that was really frus-
trating about online courses is [students]
found it difficult to connect with the
instructor,” Smith Jaggars said of the
Virginia study. “Students said to us that
they often felt like they were teaching
themselves.”

And even though technology has
evolved in recent years, the online class
success rate has not improved, Smith
Jaggars said.

On average, about 85 percent of stu-
dents who start a Washington commu-
nity college course complete it success-

fully, said Connie Broughton, director of
eLearning and Open Education for the
Washington State Board for Community
and Technical Colleges. ,

Online courses have completion rates
that are six to 10 percentage points lower,
she said. -' ~ 3

“Maybe working online calls out those
skills that these students don’t have yet,”
Broughton said. “It may be reading —

they may read slow. Or keyboarding.”

The nation’s community colleges gen-
erally offer more online courses than
four—year schools because more of their
students work full— or part-time, or are
raising a family, and need ﬂexibility.

. Online courses are the fastest-growing

‘type of ‘course offering at community

colleges. Last year, about 127,000 Wash-
ington community college students took
online courses, Broughton said.

She said online courses in Washing-
ton are capped at about 30 students per

‘ class, so instructors have time to answer

questions and grade papers, even though
they usually never meet their students
in person. ~
Online courses cost the students,
and the state, about the same amount as
courses taught face—to-face, Broughton
said. , -
“One thing that’s pretty clear — stu-
dents who do worse online, as the study

points out, are students who are already '

challenged to be in school,” she said.

She said state schools are using many
of the suggestions made by the study, as
well as offering tutoring and help from
librarians and providing more faculty
training. " 1

COLUMN

- Lack of federal oversight to unpaid T ’

internships burdens universities

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

The plight of a college student
often involves the process of ac-
quiring hands-on experience or
an internship before receiving a
jo.b offer. However, finding such
a beneﬁcial experience can be a
daunting task.

Though unemployment num-
bers have dropped, the demand
for unpaid‘ internships hasn’t
dwindled. Over time, the exis-
tence of unpaid internships has
lessened employers’ willingness
‘to offer a salary, knowing that
they can obtain highly beneﬁcial
work for the company without
having to pay for it. *

The emphasis of beneﬁt needs
to be placed on the intern, not
the employer.

. While there’s hope for these
potential interns, federal over-
sight and protection of unpaid
interns hasn’t kept up with the
increase of said opportunities.
There’s a frightening obscurity
in this country’s internship labor

laws that has essentially left a ‘

hole for employers to ﬁll at their
will; which usually involves un-

paid interns. , 4
This leaves young j b seekers
feeling successful with any in-
ternship they acquire, but might,
in fact, beneﬁt the employers
more than the company’s interns.
It’s hard to determine who ben-
eﬁts whom because these laws
need to be more clearly deﬁned.
Taking a look at the six re-
quirements set by the U.S. De-
partment of Labor in 2010, one
can see that deﬁning a legal, un-
paid internship can be incredibly
vague. .
“The internship, even though
it includes actual operation‘ of
the facilities of the employer, is
similar to training which would
be given in an educational en-
vironment; The internship ex-
perience is for the beneﬁt of
the intern;;The intern does not
displace regularemployees, but
works under close supervision
of existing staff; The employer
that provides the training derives
no immediate advantage from
the activities of the intern; and
on occasion its operations may
actually be impeded; The intern
is not necessarily entitled to a
job at the conclusion of the in-
ternship, and the employer and

the intern understand that the
intern is not entitled to wages for
the time spent in the internship.”
The internship experience
should be educational and pure-
ly for the beneﬁt of the intern
rather than the employer. The
intern also can’t displace regular
employees and isn’t guaranteed
a full—time job — or any job, for
that matter — with the company
once theinternship is over.

The ambiguity of these re-
quirements isn’t helping college
students secure quality intern-
ships.

The idea that an intern’s work
can’t benefit the employer could
stop the intern from perform-
ingproductively. How do interns
manage working for a company
while making sure they reap the
most beneﬁts? It’s simply‘ con-
fusing to describe it like a para-
sitic relationship. Using terms
such as educational, which can
be deﬁned in an inﬁnite number
of ways, adds to this confusion.

An’ approach with such a
broad and general scope isn’t
adequate during a time when un-
paid internships are on the rise

and are considered normal. Less protec-
tion is offered to interns because of this
approach, especially.w'hen’it’s combined
with loosely deﬁnedigrequirements.’ I

This generality hasforced universities
to step in and pick ulplgwhere the govern-
ment’s lack of oversight leaves off, forcing
them to protect theirstudents’ rights in
unpaid internships in addition to already
using their resources -to help place stu-
dents in internships. Many universities
have accepted this task by developing tools
to help potential interns.

This past fall, Pitt made the effort to
help students obtain an internship with

their Internship Preparation Program,
which is a part of the University’s Ofﬁce
of Career Development and Placement As-

sistance. A few program sessiptis include.

intjernship interview preparationl, resume’
building and assistance with searching
for internships. These programs will help
guide potential interns to find the best
available internship, which can prepare
them for the workplace.

Additionally, Pitt’s FutureLinks system
provides students with a great way to jump
into different internship opportunities
that are available in the area. In fact, a
simple query on FutureLinks shows that
there are more internship listings than
listings for both full-time and entry—level
positions.

A similar example of a co1lege’s intern-
ship search website is UCLA’s Bruinview.
BruinView’s staff actually evaluates every

; sinteﬁiship‘ based on its job description

and ‘how well-established the company
is before presenting it to students and
possible interns.

While universities should be praised for
acting as interns’ guardians, the burden
of enforcing internship labor laws and
ensuring quality internships should‘not
rest on their shoulders.

To help standardize the quality of in-
ternships, the federal government should
adopt a program similar to CDPA’s Intern-
ship Preparation Program. This would
include a national database of internship
opportunities, which would receive public

input and feedback. If a problem or suspi-
cious internship appears in the database,
interns could alert the federal govern-
ment, who, in turn, could step in and hold
employers accountable. The obscurity of
the U.S. Department of Labor—deﬁned in-
ternship guidelines could be forgiven if
there’s federal oversight of internships.

This database could ease the strain
on universities that work toward finding
internships for students, thus, shifting
educational focus to improving the stu-
dents’ skills.

Unpaid internships are a student’s rite
of passage to a paid job, but the federal
government should maintain and foster
this important section of its labor force.

ndrpids had relentless energy at Mr. Small’s on Sunday night.
‘ Photo courtesy of Facebook

John Lavanga
Impulse Editor

As he caught his breath and slowly
played out the last poignant notes of
“Evil’s Sway,” Japandroids guitarist
Brian King looked out into the sweaty,
clamoring crowd with a smirk and
leaned toward his microphone.

“Guess we shouldn’t have waited
three years to come back, eh Pitts-
burgh?” _

Withcheers and laughs, the crowd

~ at Mr. Small’s Theatre in Millvale —

already battered and exhausted but
nowhere near ready to slow down -
concurred. For many, this was the show
they’d been waiting months for. Others
had been waiting for almost three years
since Japandroids had last taken the
stage at Mr. Small’s with The Walkmen.

Since the band’s~20o9 breakthrough
album, Post-Nothing, the band has de-
veloped a reputation for raucous, spir-
ited performances full of jovial thrash-
ing and beer-soaked anthem singing.
On Sunday night, Japandroids came
through again with a show that will

certainly tide fans over until the band’s

next stop in town.
With only two albums of about eight
songs each the ba_ndddidn’t have to

 

worry about overstaying its welcome.

-Japandroids wasted no time cutting

to the fan favorites from its newest
album, Celebration Rock, opening with
“Adrenaline Nightshift” and moving on
to “Fire’s Highway” only a few songs
later, much to the surprise and excite-
ment of the crazed fans, who alter-
nately shoved for the coveted front row
while shouting memorable verses with
complete strangers.

But when the band’s deeper cuts,
such as “Heart Sweats,” received the

same overjoyed reactions and full-force ‘

sing-alongs from the packed crowd,
it became apparent that this wasn’t
just another indie act playing to just
another indie crowd. They had clearly
internalized the line, “You can keep to-
morrow, after tonight we’re not gonna
need it.”

These were the die-hard fans who,
having resigned themselves to a Mon-
day morning of mysterious bruises and
exhaustion, had come to savor every
moment they could spend with the
band. ’ .

' The band’s performance was just
as full of vitality as the reactions of
the crowd. In a wise move, the band
avoided falling victim to the venue’s
notoriously inconsisten

 

ity by conducting its own sound check
minutes before opening. Then, sipping
full glasses ofjack Daniel’s and bottles
of Yuengling, band members brought a
manic fury to their performance. Those
close enough to catch a glimpse could
see that both King and drummer David
Prowse were just as sweat-soaked and
exhausted by the pace as anyone in the
mosh pit.

As they tore through their set list

without pausing, the breaks the band

did take only exempliﬁed the duo’s.

good nature and intensity. Both look-
ing as though they had stepped directly
out of their publicity photo, King was
laser—focused on his performance while
‘Prowse was unassuming and kindly,
jawing casually with the front row,
laughing at jokes and nodding at com-
pliments and encouragement.

_ When the band closed with “For the
Love of Ivy,” King stood on Prowse’s
drum set as they played every note with
an incomparable level of passion, get-
ting the crowd roaring one last time
before abruptly ending their set. The
venue cleared quickly. The band and
the crowd left it all on the floor of Mr.
Small’s and were off to deal with the
gloriously painful tomorrow they were

BREW’S CLUES  ”

Hoppy beers

  aren’t just
for snobs  

Jackson Crowder
x _ For The Pitt News

llsmall‘, green and packed with ﬂavor, hops

are curious little ﬂowers. They don’t look

like ﬂowers — not by a long shot. They

. look more like little green pine cones than

' anything else. They grow upward on vines,

as if to mimic the more respected, though

unrelated, grape, and to call marijuana a
close botanical cousin.

I Today, we know the humble hop as that

 which makes our beer dbitterj or ‘_‘sour,’i as
 one of my more picky roommates likes to
‘ say. Though they have become a ﬂavoring

. agent, that was not always their primary
use. Originally, hops were a preservative,
helping brewers ensure the longevity of their
beers back when beerwas safer to drink
than water.

Thankfully, we’ve come a long way since
then: With the explosion of American mi-
crobrewing in the ‘90s, hops have found
not only a home, but a place of honor here
in the states.

Unfortunately, great ability often leads
to great arrogance, hence, the elitism that
now characterizes the American micro-

brewing scene. Thus, hops, which star in

all varieties of pale ales, cater largely to an

experienced crowd with palates accustomed

to their ferocity.

With hoppy beers sporting monikers
such as “Hopsecutioner,” “Zombie Dust”
and, my personal favorite, “On the Wings
of Armageddon,” how can a beer newbie
not feel intimidated?

Indeed, some craft breweries seem to
have gone out of their way to make hops
as inhospitable as possible. Some imperial
(10 percent alcohol by volume or above)
American and Indian pale ales have a similar
taste and mouthfeel akin to chewing on a
Christmas tree. Most craft brewers, wary of
being considered too “mainstream,” sport
an abusively hoppy beer or two all year long,
leading to the myth that a healthy enjoyment
of hops is the sole province of the initiated.

This, luckily, is not true. There are a great
many hoppy beers to help any novice take
his or her first step on the path to beer ﬁil—
ﬁllment.

. Hidden behind the unpleasantness is an
invitation to return for another sip. In that
regard, hoppy beers are a bit of a mystery,
creating a strong push-pull reaction that
draws even the most timid beer drinker
in for another go—round. A love of hops is
perfectly analogous to a love of spicy food.

REVIEW      1: a
‘Radio Golf’ provides uncomfortably
close look at gentriﬁcation

“Radio Golf"

Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre

937 Liberty Avenue, 3rd Floor

June 8-29

Admission: $25 online, $30 at the door,
Wednesday and Thursday tickets are $20
online, $25 at the door, students, seniors
and theatre artists pay $20 online and
$25 at the door always

Over the past several years, there has been
talk of gentriﬁcation in Pittsburgh’s neigh-
borhoods, particularly Lawrenceville and
East Liberty. But there’s a seeming timeless-
ness to this theme in Pittsburgh’s history. Set
in 1997, August Wilson’s play,“‘Radio Golf,”
explores the moral ambiguities of “reviv-
ing” — or, perhaps, commercializing — a
neighborhood, further questioning who re-
ally beneﬁts from these projects that claim to
reinvigorate the community at large.

From June 8 to June 29, Pittsburghers
have the chance to experience the timely
discussion ﬁrsthand by going to see the
Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company
perform “Radio Golf,” the last installment
of August'Wilson’s series of 10 Pittsburgh-
based plays, called “The Pittsburgh Cycle.” It
is the only theatre company to produce and
perform each of the 10 plays in the order in
which they were written.

While all of Wilson’s plays speak to the
African—American experience at large, The
Pittsburgh Cycle goes decade by decade
through the 20th century, chronicling the
Pittsburgh African—American experience. It
is the story of an Ivy League-educated man,
Harmond Wilks (Mark Clayton Southers),
and his tricky pursuit to become the ﬁrst
black mayor of Pittsburgh. Alongside him
are his wife Mame Wilks (Chrystal Bates), a
seductive yet politically-‘minded woman, and
his friend Roosevelt Hicks (Arthur Terry),
an educated and morally questionable indi-

vidual who uses his connections with white
executives to climb up the socioeconomic
ladder. While the three endeavor to gentrify
the Hill District by building an apartment
and shopping complex, there is one hitch
in the plan: 1839 Wiley Ave. Owner of the

house Elder Joseph Barlow (Kevin Brown) ~

and member of the community Sterling
Johnson (Wali Jamal) stand up against the
demolition of the home, ultimately serving
as the catalysts for tension and a change in
Harmond’s resolve. Q

Harmond’s character, wrought with in-
ternal strife and realization, is difficult to
pull off. He must wait, frequently listening
to other characters speak to him for long
periods of time, causing him to fumble awk-
wardly with stationary items or stare into
space with a slightly perturbed or merely
blank face. There’s a lack of transference be-
tween that which the audience expects from
a lead character — such as a sort of on-stage
dominance — and the passivity that these
monologues demand of him. While Southers
is both the artistic director and lead role in
PPTC’s production of “Radio Golf,” his role
as a passive observer is, at times, off-putting
and directionless. Before he ﬁnds out that
the “old man” Barlow is actually a distant
cousin of his, causing him to change his re-
solve to now save 1939 Wiley Ave., South-
ers’ performance wafts in these moments
of uncertainty and inaction. However, his
performance comes into being when he turns
on Hicks’ and his plans for the complex, and,
instead, stands up for what is right.

Perhaps the most effective scenes were
moments of deﬁance. Sterling Johnson —
the uneducated yet scrappy and lovable
character who serves as a moral compass,
constantly demanding a differentiation
between right and wrong + brilliantly
heightens the intensity of these moments.‘
In one pivotal scene, Harmond declares,
“Rightly or wrongly, we’re going to tear down

For many men, the wrist presents aprecarious
slew of options. Although strapping on an ac~
cessory has the potential to look great, it also

__ has the potential to look very, very bad. Like

anything else that you put on in the morning,
whatever goes on your radiocarpal joint should
be tailored to your personal style.

For many guys, the concept of “accessoriz-
ing” can seem either really scary or completely
superﬂuous. However, the accessory industry,
a wholly viable category of men’s fashion, isn’t
going anywhere. That being said, it’s better to
learn the basics gradually rather than undergo a
trial by ﬁre, especially inthe world of wristwear.
But, while there’s no one-size—ﬁts—all metric
for watches, bracelets and the like, there are,

- however, many undeniable do’s and don’ts.

An incredibly common mistake among
young men is the tendency to slap their entire
collection of rubber bracelets on one arm. These
oodles of bands make your forearm look like
the Fruit Stripe Gum zebra. Unless you intend
on going to some electronic music festival like
Ultra or Electric Daisy Carnival, yourarrns don’t
need to be covered in anunholy amount of neon.
Even though they might represent a good cause
— Iwear apink one for breast cancer since my
mother is a survivor —— try to stick with only
one rubber bracelet at a time. For now, a single

wrist conundrum." Luv Purohit |Visual Editor

neon band is not a fashion faux pas.

On the other hand — or wrist — anything
that is made of material that could be scav-
enged from the beach is long outdated. Look,
Johnny Tsunami, while these remnants of low
tide might have been super gnarly to sport in
middle school, leave your bracelets with shells,
shark teeth and the like at home.

On the much more acceptable end of the
wrist apparel family tree is the ocean~themed
bracelet’s distant cousin, the fabric bracelet.
Whether it’s made of cloth, braided string or
hemp, the fabric bracelet, when worn spar-

 

ingly, is a solid option for a guy who wants to
wear something on his wrist but doesn’t know
what. But, like rubber bracelets, moderation is
key — no more than one or two, and make sure
that the color scheme isn’t obnoxious.

Say no to anything —— I repeat, anything
— with spikes on it. No matter how great of
a sale Spencer’s or Hot Topic is having, any
sort of variation of the grunge—black metal-
emo-Hawthome Heights-misunderstood rock
n’ roller look is destined to backﬁre. Unless
you’re touringinan‘8os hair metal tribute band,
there’s simply no way you can pull off spiked
bracelets. - .

Finally, there’s the timeless bulwark of men’s
wristwear —— the watch. Aside from instances
of manual labor orhands-on sports or activities,
there are few situations in which you cannot
wear a watch. But that doesn’t mean watches
are always a sureﬁre success.

When I was young, my dad got me my ﬁrst
watch, and he noticed that I found it incred-
ibly uncomfortable. To placate my preadoles-
cent whining, he assured me that, eventually, I
wouldn’t even notice that the watch was there.
There would come a day when it would fit so
naturally, and I’cl be so accustomed to its place-
ment that I wouldn’t feel a thing.

He was dead wrong.

unravelsthe riddle of the wrist

or too heavy, then your relationship with your
timekeeper is doomed to fail. Luckily, there’s a
whole host of watches for all preferences. Fans
of casual athletic wear can score big with mini-
malistic plastic or rubber watches. These serve

. their purpose well and are comfortable and

basic enough to be worn and useful inthe gym.

Awatch with a leather band matches almost any

' outﬁt and seamlessly works its way into many

styles, whether you’re trying your hardest to
be hip or you’re a business—casual type of guy.

A metal watch, however, might be a bit trick-

ier. Whether you’re going all in and breaking

out the Rolex or playing it safe with a modest

; Invicta, silver is usually the better way to go.

It’s alternative, gold, looks gaudy on men more
often than not. Note that this isn’t necessarily
an indictment of all gold jewelry for men. It’s

0 just worth noting that while gold might look
great in a particularly bourgeois situation, it
won’t look great in your 8 a.m. chemistry lab.

pain and ﬁnd the subtleties of ﬂavor behind it.

A balanced pale ale should both pack a
good hoppy punch and enable a drinker to
taste the menagerie of ﬂavors thatthe ﬂow-
ers impart to their host brew. Hop ﬂavors
can range from spicy pine to tart grapefruit,
all the way to banana and ﬂoral strawberry,
with more and more becoming apparent as
the palate grows more experienced.

In short, brewers talk a big game, and the
bottle labels look tough, but, given proper
time and effort, hops will become your best
friend before you know it.

Here are a few beers to help you get
started:

Stone Pale Ale

Hailing from Escondido, Calif., Stone
Brewing Company has emerged as a taste-
maker in the American beer scene. While the
company is known primarily for the scary,
but sinfully delicious, Arrogant Bastard Ale,
Stone does indeed have a soft side. Its pale
ale offering has enough of a hops component
to keep things interesting, and there’s a sig-
niﬁcant and silky smooth malt aspect that
makes this beer not only forgiving, but even
a bit refreshing. Note to beginners: Do not
confuse Stone’s pale ale with its India pale

ale. Put simply, they’re very different.

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company —
or, as I like to call it, Northern California’s
greatest contribution to western civilization

 E2?!  in  

' Alla-687-7777 {Pick Up 8 cutamg)
4l2-421-934 {Delivery} V

IIIXXIIIX

-— is almost solely responsible for America’s
relative obsession with hops. Since its incep-
tion, Sierra’s ﬂagship brew has been convert-
ing beer unbelievers, taking no prisoners all
the while. Like Stone’s lesser—known offering,
it’s something of a gateway pale ale. Combin-
ing signiﬁcant hop ﬂavor and bite with a malt
component that’s soothing, but a bit less no-
ticeable than Stone’s, Sierra’s brew goes down
easily enough and is certain to change the way
you think about beer. Plus, it is available on
tap at Hemingway’s Cafe for $2 every Friday!

East End Big Hop

In the mood for something local? Pitts-
burgh’s own East End Brewing Company’s
Big Hop pale ale, which is starting to pop up
on tap all across the city, is a sureﬁre winner.
Don’t let the name fool you: Big Hop is one
of the more forgiving, yet satisfying pale ales
around today. Hoppier than Stone, but less
so than Sierra Nevada, Big Hop occupies a
comfortable middle ground for those look-
ing to challenge their taste buds, but not too
much. So, if you’re motivated, expand your
beer horizons while also supporting an up-
and-coming local business. _

A word of caution: The ﬁrst few sips —— and
maybe even the whole ﬁrst beer —- might
be a rough experience. But please, I implore
you to stick with it. Buy a six pack and drink

' it slowly, perhaps alternating your pale ale

of choice with something, well, worse, such
as Natty, Bud Light, etc. Eventually, you’ll be
able to taste past the bitterness, picking out
the subtle fruit ﬂavors that it hides. I

the house,” to which Johnson exasperates,
“Rightly or wrongly?” catching Harmond
in a verbal faux pas’, that“ illuminates rnuch
about iﬁtent."H~icks enters" and threatens to
have him arrested’ for loitering. ‘In a sym-
bolic act of deﬁance, Sterlingsets down his
bucket of red paint, dips his two ﬁngers into
it and swipes them across his cheeks and
down his forehead — he is the Indian, and
Harmond, the cowboy, subverting the in-
nocent cowboys and Indians game they used
to play as children.johnson beats his chest
twice and raises a ﬁst into the air. The scene
ends, heavy with the pronouncement of war.

While the set is minimal, PPTC utilized
subtle, symbolic production choices for a
ﬁiller effect. Audience members could see the
evolving relationship between Harmond and
Sterling in something as small as a chair. In

‘ the beginning, Harmond’s arrogant disdain

for the uneducated Sterling was exempliﬁed
by the way he would move the chair after
Sterling adjusted it slightly, symbolizing
his need to ﬁx whatever Sterling touches.
In the same way, there’s a deterioration in
Harmond’s wardrobe along with the break-
ing down of his arrogant dissonance: Instead
of being clad with suit and tie, by the end,
Harmond’s.shirt was untucked and his de-
meanor was disheveled and manic.

While many of us enjoy going to plays or
other shows to sit back, relax and watch the
production, there’s distance and anonymity

in sitting in the audience. The PPTC’s small
theatre demands a certain intimacy when
eye level with the actors. On one hand, the
physical closeness can parallel an emotional
closeness: The facial expressions of each ac-
tor are clearly visible, and the audience was
able to hear their subtle breaths and watch
every muscle twitch, creating a highly emo-
tive experience. On the other hand, it might
have felt too close: In moments of racial
strife or powerﬁil decrees of humanity, the
audience’s culpability was elevated. The ac-
tors could, and sometimes did, look out into
the individual sets of eyes in the audience.
While the self-serving motives of Hicks
are certainly portrayed as villainous, de-
tachedly bulldozing OldJoe’s house in order
to beneﬁt himself, Pittsburghers today dis-
cuss whether pursuits to revitalize certain
communities are in the best interests of the
' current natives or if they further stratify our
communities, pulling some up and pushing
others out.
There’s beauty in watching Pittsburghers

perform a play set in Pittsburgh, written by -

one of the city’s most renowned poets and
playwrights. While it’s no upscale production
—— there are no ushers, no curtains and, in-
stead, a rhythm-and—blues vibe exudes from
‘the speakers and paint—scraped walls — it
seems all the more organic for that reason.
The Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Com-
pany strips away the ﬂuff and stays true to
its urban roots, telling a story of community,
race and human evolution._ The timeliness is
unexpected and invigorating —- a play that is
just as important now as it was 16 years ago.

Steve Pederson’s extension:
Was it warranted?

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Last week, Steve Pederson’s con-
tract as Pitt’s athletic director
was extended for another five
years. Pederson’s deal now car-
ries his second tenure as Pitt’s
athletic director through 2018.

Yes, this is Pederson’s second
tenure at Pitt. In case you forgot,
Pederson left Pitt for Nebraska
in 2002 after he received the
General R. Robert Neyland Ath-
letic Director Award, presented
by the All-America Foundation
for excellence in administrative
achievement.

Pederson returned to Pitt as
athletic director in November
2007 after he was ﬁred from
the same position at Nebraska
roughly a month earlier.

Amid discussion of Peder-
son’s extension, one question
begs to be asked: Has Pederson’s
performance merited an exten-
sion?

The higher—ups gave nothing
but glowing reviews of Peder-
son when the extension was an-
nounced.

“With the University ofPitts-
burgh set to officially join the

*6!‘

Atlantic Coast Conference on
July 1, our athletic programs
never have been better posi-
tioned for future success,” Chan-
cellor Mark A. Nordenberg said
when announcing the extension.
“That is a real tribute to the hard
work and effective leadership
provided by Steve Pederson as
Pitt’s athletic director.” .
And whenjuly 1 hits, Pitt will
officially become a member of
the Atlantic Coast Conference.
“Pitt has a terrific asset and
leader in Steve Pederson. He’s
one of the most experienced and

respected athletics ‘directors in A

the country, and he’s already
made a positive and prominent
impact around the ACC table,”
said conference commissioner
John Swofford.

So there’s that.

But what are examples of the
“hard work,” “effective leader-
ship” and “positive and promi-
nent impact” referenced by Nor-
denberg and Swofford?

For one, Pederson has accom-
plished some good things for
Pitt's athletic image, including
brokering the transition from
Adidas to Nike as Pitt’s official
equipment and apparel provider.

- Steve Pederson’s extension keeps him at: Pitt through 2018. Sarah Kontos | Senior Staff Photographer

Speaking of transitions, Ped-
erson also guided Pitt from the
crumbling Big East to the ACC.
Without a doubt, the conference
change should bolster Pitt’s sta-
tus as one ofthe nation’s above-

average athletic programs. Not‘

elite, but above—average.

Beyond that, Pederson’s hires
include men’s basketball coach
Ben Howland and former foot-
ball coach Walt Harris. Harris,
hired in 1997, guided Pitt to the
Liberty Bowl — its first bowl ap-
pearance in eight seasons. Har-
ris also led Pitt football to its
first BCS bowl game ever, a 35-7
loss against Utahiin the 2005
Fiesta Bowl. ' "

And in 1999, Howland began
the process that has now vaulted
Pitt basketball into its status
among the nation’s top programs
before leaving for UCLA in 2003.

Pederson also hired current
track and field coach Alonzo
Webb, current baseball coach
Joejordano, women’s basketball
coach Traci Waites and volley-
ball coach Chris Beerman. All of
the six hires won Big East Coach
of the Year at one point. So that

A few months after the upset loss
to Wichita State in Salt Lake City
in the first round of the NCAA
Basketball tournament, Pitt
basketball players will take the
floor once again in front of Pitt
fans. But this time, those players
won’t play for Pitt.

Rather, the players will par-
ticipate in the Pittsburgh Pro-
Am League, held annually in
.Greentree.‘The league features
teams sponsored by local com-
panies, and the teams are com-
posed of amateur players from
the Pittsburgh area or those who
play for local college basketball
teams such as Pitt, Duquesne
and Robert Morris.

. As a watered-down preview
of what fans can expect from
Pitt basketball in its 2013-2014

season, combined with the nu-
merous questions surrounding
the team following the gradua-
tion of seniors Dante Taylor and
Travon Woodall, the transfers of
_]._]. Moore and Trey Zeigler and
the foray of Steven Adams to the
NBA Draft, here are a few.story—
lines to watch over the summer.

James Robinson: Alpha dog.

The then—freshman point
guard proved himself wise be-
yond his years in 2012-2013, av-
eraging 26.6 minutes per game
over the course of his first sea-
son at Pitt. The large number of
minutes played by the freshman
was a rarity for a member of a
Jamie Dixon—coached team, but
it was also a testament to Rob-
inson’s capabilities.

Now, with two-year starter
Woodall no longer at Pitt, Rob-

At the NCAA National Championship

A, meet, heldjune 8 in Eugene, Ore.,junior

Carvin Nkanata placed seventh in the

' 200—meter dash en‘ route to his selec-

tion as a first team All-American. Brycen
Spratling also earned second team All-
American honors after his 16th-place
ﬁnish in the 400—meter dash.

Nkanata, running out of laneeight
in the ﬁnals of the 200—meter. dash, ﬁn-
ished with a time of 20.47 seconds ——_ his
fourth-fastest mark of the season in the
event. Ameer Webb of Texas A&M won
the event with a time of20.10 seconds.

The race ended a season that saw Nk-
anata attain a great deal of success after
transferring from Iowa Central Commu-
nity College. ~

Nkanata set a Big East record in the
200-meter dash when he ran a 21.04
to take home the championship in the
indoor event. He was also a part of the
record—breaking 4x400 relay team that
set a school record time of 3:07.32. As

a result, Nkanata was named a second.

team All-American after his work on the
indoor circuit. .

As for the outdoor portion of the sea-
son, Nkanata won the 200-meter dash
at the Big East Outdoor Track and Field

Championship meet after he posted a
time of 20.83 seconds. He was later
named the meet’s Most Outstanding Per-
former. M

Nkanata later set a meet record with
a dash of20.32 in the 200-meter at the
ECAC—IC4A championships. His time was
also the second-fastest 200 meter in the
nation.

In the semi—finals of the 200 meter at
NCAA nationals, Nkanata set a ca.reer—

' best mark in the event when he. ran a

20.29-second race.

As for Spratling, the junior sprinter
also ﬁnished off a decorated 2012-2013
season, which saw him run the world’s
third-fastest time in the 500-meter dash
at the Big East Indoor Championship.
Spratli_ng’s 1:00.37 mark set an NCAA
record, and Spratling was selected as the
Most Outstanding Performer of the meet.

Alongside Nkanata, Spratling was also
a~member of the record-breaking 4x400
meter relay team.

Outdoors, Spratling set school records
in the 4x200 and the 4x400 meter relay
atthe Penn Relays. Spratling ran a 1:23.77
in the-4x200 and a 3:04.16 in the 4x400,‘
the ﬁfth-fastest time in the nation.

At the Big East Outdoor Champion-
ship, Spratling ﬁnished second overall.

inson must becomethe alpha dog in Pitt’s
backcourt. It’s a role Robinson was able to
fill at times last season (see: the last 1 1/2
minutes against Oakland last November)
but one he had to keep in check, with the
ﬁfth-year senior and unquestioned lead-
ership of Woodall still present.

Over the course of his freshman cam-
paign, Robinson averaged 6.1 points per’
game on 36.8 shooting, 3.5 assists and 2.1
rebounds per game. Robinson led the Big
East in assist—to-turnover ratio at 2.83:1
and ﬁnished ninth overall in the category

in all of Maryland.

At center, Pitt receives help in the
form of 6—foot-11joseph Uchebo after
he transferred to Pitt from Chipola Col-
lege in Florida. Uchebo has a pre—existing"‘
connection to the Panthers, as he played
high school basketball with incoming
freshman point guard Josh Newkirk at
Word of God Christian Academy in North
Carolina.

Uchebo was the No. 15-ranked center .
recruit out of high school in 2011 and
averaged 12 points and 12 rebounds in
his freshman year at Chipola before a
knee injury sidelined him in,his sopho-
more campaign. Uchebo is believed to

Zanna (23.9), Dante
Taylor (15.7) and _].]. Moore (18.7). Now,
no more than three months after Pitt’s
season ended abruptly, only Zanna re-
mains.

Fortunately for Pitt, Dixon’s spring-
time recruiting prevented a potentially
disastrous situation‘ from unfolding in
which the Panthers would have ﬁelded
a dangerously thin front line. In addi-
tion to Mike Young, who committed to
Pitt last August, forward Jamel Artis and

JUCO-transfer Joseph Uchebo will pro- _

vide a desperately needed depth in the
frontcourt for the Panthers.

Young is the highest-proﬁle newcomer
of the group and is far and away the prize
of Dixon’s 2013 recruiting class. Ranked
No. 57 in ESPN’s top 100 recruits in the
class of 2013, as well the No. 15 power
forward, the 6-foot-8, 245—pound forward
out of Saint Benedict’s Prep in Newark,
N.J., should see immediate minutes in
the fall.

Young brings aversatile game, fea-
turing prowess on the perimeter, off the
dribble and in the post. Over the summer,
watch as Young matches up against his
teammates and some of the area’s best,
as a test of his skills.

In addition to Young, Artis joins the
Pitt frontcourt as another versatile for-
ward. At 6-foot-7 and 210 pounds, the
small forward out of Notre Dame Prep
enters Pitt as the No. 7-ranked prospect

who averaged 6.1
points per game.
Although he played small forward, La-
mar Patterson also provided a scoring
punch for the Panthers from the outside
with his three-point stroke, averaging 10
points-per game. But for Pitt to replace
the production ofWoodall, Patterson will
need to improve his consistency in the
2013-2014 season. While he came up with
big performances in certain instances (22
points against Marquette injanuary), he .
would also disappear for stretches dur—"
ing games. -
Besides Patterson, Durand Johnson
showed a penchant for ﬁring at will in
the 2012 Pro-Am, and his play should be
no different this year. Johnson should
receive more time on the floor this season ,_
as a redshirt sophomore, and he earned

_ more time as last season progressed be-

cause of his increased energy on the de-

y fensive end combined with his dangerous

offensive game.

Cam Wright was another player who
was supposed to see signiﬁcant minutes 
last season, and, with minutes opening
up, the player regarded as‘Pitt’s best pe-
rimeter defender next to Robinson should
get to see a lot of time on the ﬂoor next
season. Over the summer, the emphasis
for Wright might rest on scoring more, a
as his less-than-stellar offensive game
was a reason‘Dixon’s allocation of min-
utes to Wright proved inconsistent in
2012-2013.;

was pretty good, and then Pederson left
for Nebraska.

In that first tenure, Pederson also
oversaw the demolition of Pitt Stadium
and changed the Panthers’ logo -from
“Pitt” in the “Pitt script” to “Pittsburgh,”
much to the chagrin of long—time Panther
fans.

Along with the logo change, Pederson
also changed Pitt’s colors from blue and
yellow to a navy blue and-Vegas gold.

In his return to Pitt, Pederson ex-
tended basketball coach Jamie Dixon’s
contract in 2008 and again in 2013 and

   

later ﬁred Dave Wannstedt. His replace-
ment, Mike Haywood, was ﬁred shortly
thereafter when he was charged with
felony domestic battery.

Replacing Haywood was Todd Graham,
who spent less than a‘ year at Pitt and
ducked out the back door in December as
he resigned and accepted the head coach
position at Arizona State after Pitt denied
him permission to talk to Arizona State
regarding the job. _

As a result of the tumult and residual
fallout from the three head coaches in
one year, Pitt football is still suffering.
Just look at the recent transfer of tailback
Rushel Shell to UCLA, which left Pitt with
next to nothing in the backfield.

Is that Pederson’s fault? I’d say sci.

‘When it comes to Pitt athletics, lately
it seems as though a circular pattern has
emerged over the recent years. Star ath-
letes are transferring, teams are faltering

‘ in the postseason (basketball, baseball

and football this season), and Pitt faces
continued irrelevancy in most every sport
besides the major ones and wrestling.
Maybe it is time for a change.
Pederson’s work to transition Pitt ath-
letics into the ACC might have bought

him a few more years here, but with high’

expectations surrounding Pitt, this exten-
sion could be Pederson’s last if the pat-

tern of mediocrity and failure continues. Q

I wouldn’t mind that. I
