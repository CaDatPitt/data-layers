PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1939

College Requires
Class Schedules 0
F or Coming Term

Stanton C. Crawford, dean of the
College, announces that all students
in the College must submit course
sele_ction cards for next semester to
the ofﬁces of their major depart-
ments between May 1 and 11.

Students whose last names begin
with the letters A to R will report
to their major offices to get cards be-

tween May 1 and 5. Students whose»

last names begin with letters S to Z
will report between May 8 and 11.

Dr. Crawford stresses the neces-
sity of complying promptly with the
requirements. Even if plans for deg-
istration for next semester are not
deﬁnite, cards should be ﬁlled out.
No student will be permitted to reg-
ister next fall for whom a course se-
lection has not been made.

There are ﬁve groups in the Col-
lege to whom the requirement does
not apply. These are: freshmen who
entered in February; pre-dental and
pre-medical freshmen; sophomores
who plan to enter dental school next
fall; seniors who expect to ﬁnish in
June or August, 1939; and special
students.

Sophomore pre-education students
in the secondary school group should
consult the heads of their prospective
major departments. Freshmen in the
commercial education, physical edu-
cation, elementary education, voca-
tional education, and nursing groups
should report to Dr. Omar Held in
the College office.

Chemistry majors should refer to
the chemistry bulletin board to de-
termine the names of advisers whom
they should consult.‘

Each student is requested to bring
a-copy of his blue-print record and
to have a tentative schedule made up
before conferring with his adviser.

Rolleilgkating Pair
Violates Commons

A dance ﬂoor in the Commons
Room has long been proposed by
the students, but a couple of Ca-
thedral visitors have other ideas for
the slick green slabs of Commons
Room ﬂoor the other evening.

Gaining entrance at the Fifth
avenue revolving.’do'ors, the young
couple on roller-skates swung
smoothly from the‘ rubber mat
down a barrel vault,vbanked sharp-
ly for a right turn through the ele-
vator lobby, and roared into the
inviolate Commons. Forty-ﬁve feet
below dim arches they whirled
once around the ﬂoor and skated
innocently out the Bigelow exit.

Head Marshall Bill Daufenbaugh
and Commons Room hostess Mrs.
Miller were reported to have
raised no end of eyebrows when in-
formed of the violation, but
whether the culprits were caught
and chastisement administered,
The News was unable to ascertain.

Peace Leaders Describe Plans
To Ease lnternational Problems

Norton Condemns
Neutrality Statute,
Proposes Change

Passage of the Thomas amendment
to the Neutrality Act remains the
only alternative for Congress to bring
about a cessation of the Sino-Japan-
ese war. This is the opinion advanc-
ed by Robert Norton, executive sec-
retary of the American Union for
Concerted Peace Efforts.

Speaking before combined classes
in foreign relations and economics
on Wednesday, Norton condemned
the present Neutrality Act, outlined
proposed amendments to it, and ex-
plained details of the Thomas amend-
rnent.

“Our present Neutrality Act is not
a neutrality act at all,” he declared.
“This act changed the classic con-
ception of a neutral.”

Norton dismissed the suggestion
offered by the late Senator Lewis that
the United States revert back to
complete neutrality and also tore
down the solution proposed by Sen.
ator Key Pittman.

“The Pittman amendment. which
would make the government go on
an entirely cash and carry basis,
makes the same mistake as the pres-
ent Neutrality Act,” he said.

Norton believed that Pittman’s Act
was designed to ﬁt the European sit-
uation, not the far-Eastern. He
pointed out that it would operate to
the advantage of Japan because of
the 164 millions she has in gold.

Davis Makes Plea
For U. S. Isolation
In Event of War

“America should stay out of a Eu-
ropean war,” according to Howard P.
Davis, foreign editor of News-Week,
“because the United States must not
get mixed up in the essentially im-
perialist ventures of the European
powers.”

Speaking before the Y Public Af-
fairs Committee, and Peace Council,
Mr. Davis pointed out that the de-
velopment of national relations in
Europe deﬁnitely showed that the
present differences between the pow-
ers was not so much a question of
ideologies as a question of who was
to have the greatest empire.

Tracing the development of di-
plomacy from the free and open kind
asked for by Woodrow Wilson after
the war to the present “alliance” tac-
tics, the speaker showed how the tac-
tics of the democratic group aided
materially in the establishment of the ~.
strength of its present enemies.

From the very beginning, in 1919,
the League failed to enforce sanc-
tions and allowed the stealing of
Fiume and Vilna. It showed that the
major powers were unwilling to take
a stand for the smaller powers.

The the formation of Czechoslova-
kia by France to serve as a spear-
head into Germany was a bit of in-

Because of the present coal strike,
officials of the Pittsburgh Coal com-
pany have requested the YMCA to

aration plant planned for this after-

Scheduled to be the third of the
series of bi-weekly trips arranged
by the Commission, the trip will be

Council Members
Choose President
For Coming Year

A rumor of many weeks’
standing was conﬁrmed Tuesday
when Henry DeRocher, M40, was

elected president of Men’s Council
for the coming year, at a joint
meeting of the new and old groups.

Since his election to the group,
it was understood that DeRocher
would succeed William Hoeveler,
C39, as president of the men’s
group.

Other officers elected by the 13
members of the group are: Alvin
Ludwig, BA4l, vice president; Jo-
seph Ziesenheim, BA40, secretary;
and Richard Besch, E41, treasurer.
Besch and Ludwig were members
of last year’s group, chosen by in-
ternal elections to remain in office
for another year.

Besch will head the freshman
customs program of Men’s Council
for the coming year, it was an-
nounced by Robert R. Corley, as-
sistant dean of men and adviser to
the group.

DeRocher is a member of this
year’s SFA assembly. He is pro-
duction manager of Cap and Gown,
and a member of Pi Kappa Alpha,
men’s social fraternity. Ludwig is
a member of Theta Chi, Besch of
Lambda Chi Alpha, and Ziesen-
heim of Phi Delta Theta. Hoevel-
er, outgoing president, is a member
of Kappa Sigma.

Eleven members of the new
group are fraternity men, while
two of the newly-elected represen-
tatives are Independent Party men.

Bruner Speaks
At Next Forum

“Social Legislation in Pennsyl-
vania” will be discussed by Dr. David
K. Bruner, assistant professor of so-
cial administration, at Inquiry For-
um Monday at 1 o’clock, in 129 Ca-
thedral. ‘

Dr. Bruner will deal particularly
with legislation presented in the 1939
legislature in Harrisburg, according
to William W. Mendenhall, executive
director of the YMCA.

Problems of social legislation that
have been particularly dealt with in
Inquiry Forum this year, include the
discussion of socialized medicine by
the secretary of the Allegheny Coun-
ty Medical Association and the re-
cent review of social legislation pass-
ed at the unicameral session of the
sixth annual Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on Government.

Eighteen graduates and undergrad-
uates will be initiated into the Beta
chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, national
honorary history fraternity, at the
annual Founder’s day banquet in the

Pittsburgh Athletic Association to-
morrow evening.

the University of Rochester, will
speak on “The Monroe Doctrine: Past
and Present.”

Health Services
To Begin Tests

Second of a series of anti-disease
campaigns will begin Monday at the
Student Health Service with the in-
auguration of tuberculin tests for
men students, the ﬁrst step in an
intensive anti-tuberculosis campaign
to be staged on campus under the
auspices of the University Health
Services and The News.

“An incipient disease such as tu-
berculosis is unknowingly contracted
and spread among thousands of Uni-
versity age level, whereas venereal
diseases that have been tested for
during the past two weeks are usual-
contracted without ignorance,”
points out Dr. Auleene Jamison, di-
rector of the women’s health service,
in stressing the greater importance
attached to the tuberculin tests than
to? the Wasserman tests.

 "Although the tests for women will
not begin until a week from Monday,
Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
Men’s Health Service, explicitly re-
quests all men students who did not
take the tests last year to take advan-
tage of this opportunity.

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
of next week will be reserved for
preliminary tests. Forty-eight hours
later a reading will be taken, and, if
it proves negative, will be repeated
more intensively. If still negative,
the student will be dismissed -—— a
healthy specimen.

If, however, traces of the disease
are discovered, X-ray examinations
will be given to determine the extent
of infection.

At 9:30 o’clock Monday morning,
Dr. Carlson and his staff expect all
self-interested men students to re-
port to Falk Clinic for tuberculin
tests.

associate professor of music appre-
ciation, the local club will sing at
the Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chi-
cago. They will return to campus

Today, in the United States, the neutrality battle rages, with ad-

£('

herents of the ’.I.‘liomas and l’ittman amendments, of complete isola-
tion,” of a war referendum not-too-peaceably ﬁghting it out. (For
complete details, see stories on page one.)

Yet today, in the midst of all this strife and turmoil, The News
blithely carries in its advertising columns a bit of sparkling copy on
“Gay G‘Cl.‘IIl:?l.'.*l,_\’” supplied by the 5% <
“G eriiiuii Railroads ln formation
()i.’i‘icc.

States, when this advcrtiscnient so
completely echoes the good
Fuehrer’s sentinieiits. it is, of
course, absurd to single out Nazi
Germany as an aggressor, to point
out its leaders as war-niongers and I
treat'y—breakers.

For, as is so strikingly emphasized in our advertisement, all is
peace and quiet and contentment amidst Germany’s “glamorous
scenic beauty,” its “age-old art and culture.” There is no mention

of marching men, of concentration camps, of racial persecution.

 No one has even the remotest thoughts that war is imminent.
‘While that trouble-maker Roosevelt raises false fears, and sends
peace proposals to the wrong address, Vienna is “melodious” and
“mirthful,” and from “glamorous Berlin” to “lovely Rhine-kissed
lioblenz,” gay travelers and citizens “Hike and Bike, Sail and
-Swim.”

Oh, no doubt, all is lovely. An.d Brother Adolf will today -:lef_v
‘the world to prove otherwise. He will review his accomplishments
as Chancellor of the Third Reich; “no unemployment, production
at peak levels, social security, gigantic projects for industrial devel-
-iopincnts, economic planning, organized efficiency, a dynamic w1ll_of
‘pulling together——a happy, energetic people.” (Inside information
also through courtesy German Railroads Information Office.)

We sugest that all 100 per cent Americans snap up this offer
and visit Germany to view the wonders of the Nazi regime. They
will, we feel, return ﬁrmly convinced, as our ad states, that “you'll
besurprised at how little it takes to get around in Germany.

The News Browns . . .

GENERIXLLY frowned upon by The News is the practice of writ-
writing scathing indictments of slinking culprits who throw chalk
and sail paper airplanes out of Cathedral windows, who litter class-
rooms with candv wrappers and scrap paper, and scribble initials on
classroom chairs during the course of a dull lecture.

But we have recently heard di;~3turbing reports concerning prop-
erty defacement in certain of the new nationality rooms. Speciﬁc
example was a bit. of art work sketched in by some student with
obvious aesthetic inclinations on a chair in the Scottish room.

There have been similar “incidents” in some of the other rooms
wliicli have gone by unmentioned, we understand. They cail for :1
prompt expression of disapproval by students, and consequent dis-
couragement of any further attempts.

The nationality rooms were furnished by contributions from the
various nationality groups in the district and represent a consider-
able investment. They should be used with corresponding care and
respect.

That the nationalitv rooms inspire the artistic impulse seeiiis en-
couraging. Personally, we think it’s pathetic case of misdirected
talent.

“This country is far from dictatorship at present, but it Inay
expect such a leader if the universities and colleges don ’t forget the
narrow-mindedness, ambition, and regimentation that may lead to
conditions that will produce a dictator.”——Dr. Alexander G-rant

two Andy Coxes applying for a blue
voting card, and there were probably
others. It’s wonderful how your
friends will remember you when you
are away. Especially if it is election
time and you are in Europe like
Andy Cox.

But none of this can be proved,
and on the whole the false votes
probably didn’t affect many results,
except, perhaps, for Men’s Council.

VVe do know, though, of a false
vote for Julie Clemens, who tied with
Mary Lewis for junior woman. Both
probably had them. You might be
interested to know that after the
usual coin-flipping, the executive
committee declared Mary Lewis
luckier and winner of the contested
seat .

An Historic Quote

We suggest you consult last Sat-
urday’s Sun-Telegraph which is re-
plete with quotes, especially one
from Ted Biddle, assistant dean of

men, proving that the faculty knows
that the faculty runs SFA. Did I

backers of the merit idea in frater-
nity nominations. Merc Shiring
seemed to have more merit.

Also there was a question on
’ whether Sam Whiteman would con-
tinue to be the nominee along with
Pat Cusick for the committee. Emil
Naric wasn’t a successful opponent
to the idea.

More Predictions

I suppose you’ve been reading
down this far waiting for me to say
something about my last predictions
and to tell who will be president of
SFA. On the ﬁrst item, I have
nothing to say.

About the presidency, this: Be-
cause the vote will stand among the
students 17 for Cusick, 13 for Hoov-
cler, the ten faculty votes will de-
cide things. For election 21 votes are
needed; Hoeveler thus needs seven,
Cusick only four. The loser becomes
vice—president.

I-Ioeveler has many of the faculty
on his side. Cusick, an engineer, has
had as many contacts with the fac-
ulty as his “marshal” opponent.

In the face of all this I am forced
to pick I-Ioeveler for vice-president.
It’ll be too hard to get the seven
needed votes, for him to win the
election. But don”: grieve, he now
can become editor of the Panther.

HOW TO TE A TIE

Arrow, makers of famed Arrow shirts

you how to tie them. First, put the

bringing wide "end over narrow end
and up through opening at collar.
Smooth out the preliminary knot.

Next, put the wide end through the

Keeping the knot smooth is important.

Now make a groove lengthwise in the
wide end by pinching the sides to-
gether. This groove——when you pull
the tie tight—forms a dimple beneath
knot. Arrow Ties, because of their rich
fabrics, achieve this drape easily.

The ﬁnished job looks like this. Knot
not too big —— and not so tight it
screeches. Tie one of our Arrow Ties
in this manner and you have the last
word in necktie smartness.

Carl Olson, Franklin Field: This should be the day for which
you have been coaching all these years. Ben Foote just came down
from the stadium and he has assured me that Art Daley of the Times
and Jess Abramson of the Herald-Tribune are right when they say
t.hat Pitt has the best team in four of the events in the Carnival today
and tomorrow. Those events only happen to be the features of the
what you, yourself say are “world’s greatest relays.” They, are, of
course, the 440, the 880, the mile, and the sprint medley relays.

Not only do you have Frank Ohl, who might be in the ’40 Olym-
pics if there are Olympics in ’40 or if there is still a Finland, to run
on every one of those teams. But you also have the “running won-
-der of all time,” Long John Woodruff to anchor these teams. From
what I saw last year, the only rea.son three other men are run is
to see how much of a handicap Johnny can overcome. And there
wasn’t one too much for him last year.

Now, I know how uncertain the matter of passing that stick is,
but we are counting on the boys to bring home some more of those
championship murals. Be sure to give Johnny that steak for break-
fast this morning.

Honest Joe Gambal, campus: Keep up the good work. If you
don ’t turn out to be another Mike Getto, it won’t be Bobby Hoel’s
fault. Even if you don ’t make the traveling squad next fall, you ’re
still the best-built tackle in the district, and who knows wh.at to do
with a no-trump hand better than you?

Mr. John Harris, Harris Hanger, Craig Street: From a Pitt point
of view, hockey was officially ended with John McSorley’s little shin.-
dig the other evening. I should like to join with everyone in telling
jou that we think your adventure into collegiate hockey has done
much for campus athletics in our village. As for providing red—blood-
ed, excitement with the emphasis not on the red, this season certainly
was the one. All in all, however, I guess it may be said that campus
stick-swinging is now a healthy two-year old.

And while you step from tee to tee this summer, I presume you
will be thinking of more constructive means to put your hanger to
this coming winter. VVe’ve got a guy over here with an ideaand a
real promotional urge. The guy is Carl Olson, so you know the idea
will have to do with nothing but ‘track.

Well, he wants to see an indoor track carnival in Pittsburgh.
You know, something like the Millrose, the Boston AC games, or the
Knights of Columbus meets. He swears that in the big city, indoor
track packs Madison Square Garden. Also that we have some of_the
nation ’s best trackmen here to form the foundation for an invitation-
al meet. VVe do have Johnny VVoodruff, you know.

VVell, at least, ‘it’s something to think about on your way down
the fairway.

Spiked Shoe Brigade
Seeks Relay Honors

By Ben

Foote

Today and tomorrow on Franklin Field in the center of an ivy-

walled Penn campus, the greatest

squad of t.1’a.c.l<.men ever to com-

pete for the University of l’ittsb11i'gl1 seeks honors hitherto unat-

taincd by any collegiate track sq1:1a
I)efending tliree titles, striving-
races, and hoping for victory in at

d at the ~§l«:3tl‘i annual I-’eim. Iielays.
for new titles in three more relay
least one pf six individual events,

the proteges of Coaches Carl Olsone
and James Potts share a major por-
tion of the national spotlight in the
week—end programs.

Long John Woodruff and Frank
Ohl, the only spike-wearers in the
history of the games to anchor and
lead-oﬁ, respectively, three triumph-
ant foursomes, can set up a record
that would probably never again be
equalled if they should stage repeat
performances.

FORDHAM STRONG

In the feature event of the Car-
nival, the Class A college mile relay,
Ohl, Al Ferrara, Clyde Graf, and
Woodruff will be pitted against at
least ﬁve excellent teams. Chief
competition will come from Ford-.
ham’s quartet, St. Pierre, Leary,
Slater, conqueror of Woodruﬁ in the
Millrose games, and Wes Wallace,
holder of the world 500 meter stand-
ard.

Ohl, Art Thomas, Larry Tregon-
ning, and Woodruﬁ today defend the
sprint medley trophy, a Panther pos-
session since 1937. It becomes per-
manent property if Ol’ John carries
the baton across the ﬁnish line first.

Tomorrow the foursome running
the sprint medley makes a third Pitt
title defense, the 880 yard sprint re-
lay. The Panthers, as a result of last
year’s performance, are co-holders of
the meet mark of 1:25.6.

Baton exchanges will be an im-
portant factor in today’s 440 sprint
relay. Art Thomas leads off, lessen-
ing his chances for a miscue. Others
who compose this sprint group are
Ferraro, Tregonning, and Ohl., this
time in the anchor slot.

The other Pitt entry in today’s
scredule is the distance medley re-
lay. Ferrara runs the ﬁrst leg, the
"L40; Al McKee the 880, second; Del
Anderson takes care of the three-
quarter mile assignment; and Bou-
langer draws the mile anchor leg.

BAZYK FAVORED

Pitt will also enter a Class B mile
relay team tomorrow, consisting of
Tregonning, Thomas, Boulanger, and
McKee.

Johnny Bazyk is conceded the best
individual chance of winning. Uni-
versity record holder in the shot put,
he has several times passed the 50
foot mark in practice, making him a
distinct threat for honors. His great-

JOHNNY BAZYK

. . . record breaker . .

est opposition will be provided by
Bill Watson, all-around Michigan
star, and Francis Ryan, Columbia ace.

In addition to Bazyk, individual
contestants are Joe Newman in the
high hurdles; Frank Ohl in the 100
yard ‘dash and broad jump; Ted
Konetsky in the discus; Dave Mc-
Dowell in the high jump; and George
Clifton in the pole vault.

Frat Teams

Deadlocked
In Mushhall

Phi Delts, SAMS
Tied for Top Spot

Winning neatly Tuesday, Sigma
Alpha Mu and Phi Delta Theta now
share the lead in the fraternity
mushball race.

Lew Mendlow Ditched and batted
SAM to a 6-1 Victory of the Phi
Eps in Tuesday’s feature. For four
innings, not a hitter reached ﬁrst on
Lew. Phi Ep Jay Silverberg held the
SAM sluggers to one run, a homer
by Labovitz, in four frames, but in
the ﬁfth and ﬁnal frame came the de-
luge.

A walk, a hit, and an error ﬁlled
the bases; Wasserman doubled to
score two, and Mendlow blasted a
home run to climax the ﬁve—run
rally. Goldberg scored the only Phi
Ep run, after doubling in the last
half of the ﬁfth.

PHI GAMS WIN

Delta Tau Delta dropped out of
the four-way tie for ﬁrst, as did the
Phi Eps, by losing to Phi Gamma
Delta, 4-3. Both clubs tallied in the
first inning.

After the Fijis had picked up an-
other run in the second and two more
in the third, the Delts scored one in
the fourth. They repeated in the
ﬁfth to cut the Phi Gam margin to
one run, but Pitcher Hurst bore down
to stop the rally and win the ball
game.

Phi Delta Theta came through
with a win over Sigma Chi in the
third of the “feature” attractions.
The Phi Delts seemed to be trying
hard to kick the game away, but
Sigma Chi outfumbled them and
wound up on the short end of an
11-9 score.

SLUGFESTS

Nevertheless, Dannies and his
mates won, and stayed even with
Sigma Alpha Mu in the lost column.
SAM and Phi Delta Theta each
have just one defeat chalked up
against them, as they ﬁght it out for
the top spot on the fraternity mush-
ball heap.

In other games, Theta Chi, Lambda
Chi Alpha, and Pi Kappa Alpha
turned in victories. The Theta Chis
topped Kappa Sigma, 115-6, as Sim-
rell slammed three homers and Jones
got two. .
Lambda Chi Alpha outlasted the
Pi Lams, 23-21, despite a 10-run Pi
Lam outburst in the fourth. Pi
Kappa Alpha picked up two runs in
the ﬁrst and held onto their lead

to top Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 6-3.

Fourteen inter-collegiate matchesﬁ
remain on the schedule for the var-
sity tennis team after it returns from
its eastern trip.

A rained out match with Geneva
has it been re—scheduled for May 3,
and will be a home engagement for
the Pitt team. The netmen journey
to Meadville, Pa., to meet Allegheny
‘three days later, then return to their
home courts on May 9 to play against
Ohio State.

Pitt trades shots with local rivals
on May 10 and 13, playing Duquesne
and Carnegie Tech on the Stadium
courts. Grove City and West Vir-
ginia oppose the Panthers on May
16 and 17.

The Blue-and-Gold netters con-
clude the home season on May 20
‘with a match against the Slippery
Rock courtmen. The team invades
«Indiana the following afternoon. On
May 22, 24, and -27, Pitt plays at
‘Geneva, Duquesne, and Grove City,
respectively.

Matches at Carnegie Tech and at
Morgantown, W. Va., where West
Virginia furnishes the opposition,
drop the curtain on the tennis sea-
son. The latter two matches are to
be deﬁnitely scheduled at a later
date. _

While the first team engages in
inter-collegiate court battles in the

East, the reserve squad is busy
sharpening its shots. Several men
are improving rapidly, and may

break into the line—up later on.

Panthers Meet
{State Golfers

Pitt’s golf team meets the Penn
State aggregation tomorrow at Al-
coma. Pitt has chalked up one win
in two starts, the victory coming last
Saturday when the Panthers took
over the favored Tech Tartans.

Two days previously Pitt dropped
its opener to West Virginia in a
Wheeling goat pasture. A week ago
the Staters stopped the Army, 8-1.

Al.t'ncugl1 both of the outﬁts are in
the Eastern Association, this match’
will be strictly a non-league ai‘fair.
Tony Kaye will be in the No. 1 slot
\vi':“:i Bill Daddio one step behind.

Kaye, who '\V8S undefeated in last
year”:-:. Assor:i21‘lio1i play, nabbed 3. win
in the Tech meeting and is expected
to come through again tomorrow.
Daddio, with two wins so far, should
take his match handily.

McClintock will make his second
appearance and should bolster the
squad considerably. Seymour, Reilly,
and Mathias make up the balance of
the Pitt links squad.

WAA, Intramural Office to Lead

Spring Festival Sports Frograin

(Below is the first of a series of

four articles presenting a bird’s-eye-I
view of the varied events of Spring Festival week to begin on May 8.

University students will find in them the background and purpose of this

traditional week of colorful,

spring

activities, and veterans of past

Spring Festivals will find in them prospects that can be described only in

Superlatives.)

A
Who said sports were slipping at

Pitt‘?

Any rumors to that effect will be
squelched beyond doubt during
Spring Festival Week for the Festival
master minds have scheduled enough
sports events for Pitt eds and coeds
to satisfy the most exacting fans or
athletes.

With both men and women par-
ticipating in the program, the ﬁve
day period from May 8 to 12 should
be the liveliest week of athletic ac-
tivity in University history.

BOW & ARROW

There’s a little of everything in-
cluded in the Festival sports sched-
ule. The baseball team is the only
varsity club to help out during the
week, the rest of the participants
coming, for the most part, either
from W. A. A. or the Intramural De-
partment.

The Cathedral lawn will be the
scene of the week’s first event, an
archery tournarr.-ent on Monday at 1
o’clock for which any woman in the
University is eligible. The female
of the species continues the business
of being deadly—-—with a bow and ar-
row—again on Tuesday and Thurs-
day at 12:30 o’clock.

BASEBALL GAME

Ralph Mitter1ing’s baseballers will
engage the Penn State Lions at 3
o’clock Tuesday afternoon in the ﬁrst
of a two game series which will con-
clude the Panthers’ home games for
the season. Seasoned by half a dozen
contests with some of the country’s
top flight teams, Pitt should give the
Nittany nine a ﬁrst rate tussle.

Just prior to the Pitt—State match,
at 2:30 o’clock, Director James Potts
and the Intramural Athletics Depart-
ment will run off the most unique
sports spectacle ever presented at
Pitt. Close to a hundred boys, all

pion intramural teams, will compete
in a dozen sports while a narrator de-
scribes the sports and their origins.

Wednesday the Mitterling Maulers
will back again against the Lions.
The girls will be out to show up the
diamond outﬁt on Thursday with
three mushball games runnin.g from
1:30 to 3 o’clock in the stadium. A
trio of volleyball matches are slated
for the same period.

Later Thursday afternoon, the fra-
ternities stage another of their an-
nual track and ﬁeld meets at the
Stadium. Earlier this year, the
Greeks turned out en masse for an
indoor meet and the outdoor events
should draw one of the largest entry
lists ever submitted by the 13 or-
ganizations.

GIRLS PLAY GAMES

Action in all Festival departments
reaches its peak on Friday. Primar-
ily, the Friday athletic schedule is
for the beneﬁt of the participants, al-
though spectators will ﬁnd the day’s
features well worth watching.

All of the interest will be centered
on Bayard St. where the girls have
planned a full hour’s entertainment.
A relay race and a hoop relay race
are slated for 3 o’clock and 3:10
o’clock respectively, while at 3:20
will begin wh.at WAA is booming as
a “spectacular event,” including
shufﬂeboard, badminton, deck tennis,
hop scotch, and jacks.

Any women who have not yet
signed up for Spring Festival Week
sports and wish to do so should see
some members of the Women’s Sports
committee which includes Joy Hart-

amendment was the only way out,
Norton estimatedlthat two-thirds of
the American public favored an em-
bargo against Japan. 1‘

“At the present time 60 per cent
of the materials which Japan needs
to carry on the war comes from the

United States,” he asserted. This
“aid” would be removed by the pass-
age of the Thomas amendment, ac-
cording to the speaker.

Under the provisions of the amend-
ment, it shall “be unlawful, except
under such limitations and excep-
tions as the President may prescribe,
to export . . certain articles or
materials of use in war . . . from
any place in the United States to bel-
ligerent states, or any state wherein
civil strife exists . . .”

The amendment continues: “When-
ever the President shall ﬁnd that one
or more states signatory to a treaty
to which the United States is a party
is engaged in war with another state
in violation of such treaty, he may,
with the approval of a majority in
Congress, exempt such other state”
from the embargo.

Immediate application of the
amendment would result in an em-
bargo against Japan and because
Japan broke the Nine-Power treaty
of 1922, China would be exempt from
the provisions. : .

THE PITT NEWS

Coeds Favor War

Referendum Bill

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN, Texas, April 28-
Many a college student of ﬁghting
 has been pondering the Presi-
dent ’s VVarm Springs statement,
“I’ll be back in the fall—if We
don’t have a war.” And well
might these American young men
apply the statement to themselves.
Will they be back in college next fall

——or will they be behind one of
Uncle Sam’s new guns?

A startling series of events have

focussed in the public mind the one
important question, “Is there going
to be a war, and if there is, how can
we stay out of it?” College and uni-
versity students, 54.3 per cent of
them, join with the majority of the
people of this country in favoring a
national referendum before the Unit-
ed States drafts men to ﬁght away
from our shores. This is pointed out
in the latest of the coast-to-coast
studies of the Student Opinion Sur-
veys of America, the national weekly
poll of student thought of which The
Pitt News is a member.

NO REFERENDUM

However, opposition to the propo-
sal is quite widespread, for 45.7 per
cent declared against the question
asked, “Should the constitution be
changed to require a national vote
before the country could draft men
to ﬁght overseas?” In the Southern
states a bare majority, 50.9, gave ap-
proval, while the West Central group
was the most in favor, 61.2.

A large portion of College students,
then, appear to agree with the ad-
ministration, which has taken a
strong negative stand on war refer-
enda. As shown by other opinion
polls, the voters of the nation-61
per cent-—like the idea even better
than the Ludlow resolution, which
would require a vote before Congress
could declare war, for which they
have been polled at 58 per cent in
favor.

The student Survey points to this
fact: college men are as a whole
against a referendum by a small ma-
jority; women are for it by a large
majority.

AGAINST DRAFT

The attitude of many collegians
was neatly phrased by a Wayne uni-
versity student who said to the in-
terviewer there, “If we have to ﬁght
"in the defense of our country there
will be no need for a referendum’; if
it is proposed that we join a foreign
conﬂict, absolutely!” The sentiment
against drafting men for battleﬁelds
abroad evident over the country is
closely parallelled in this Survey,
which clearly exposes the state of
mind of many of the young people
who may have to interrupt their
education should an international
conﬂict arise.

made safe for Franco because of Eng-
lish investments.

Propaganda is entering into our
news, the speaker showed. An ar-
ticle which he wrote in Rome, show-
ing an Italian diplomatic victory at
a non-intervention conference two
years '1 ago was so changed in transit
through English cables, that Amer-
ican papers featured it as a French
and British triumph.

Dictatorship was sponsored by

‘England and France only three

months after the war “to make the
world safe for democracy,” Mr. Davis
pointed out. The Hungarian Social-
Democrats were sold out after they
had gotten rid of the communist re-
gime, and the Rumanian army, a
French ally, was used to establish a
Hungarian dictator.

He further noted that English im-
perialist ventures, especially those of
Sir Henri Deterding aided materially
in the rise of Hitler.
