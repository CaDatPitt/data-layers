Before council reaches a decision,
a public hearing on the matter is

A Both streets have been one-way
since a June, 1972 experiment, but
council voted an ordinance to
return to the ‘two-way traffic

‘Socialist Hopeful
  For US President

Explains Platform

,1‘;-ax. BY BILL MOORE
Socialist Workers Party candidate
for the 1976 presidential election
Peter Camejo spoke of widespread
economic and social reform in an
_ appearance here Tuesday, one of
the first in his national campaign.
Camejo, 35, has been active in
supporting civil rights and dese-
gregation and was an outspoken
__ ’ leader of the student movement in
cggthe l960’s. He ran an unsuccessful
  1970 campaign . against Senator
4 Edward Kennedy for the US Senate
in Massachusetts.
‘ Speaking at Pitt, Camejo blamed
. the present economic situation on a
small “ruling class” controlling the
government and economy in this
country. “Inﬂation is like a_ tornado
--nobody "favors tornadoes--but we
have them. But there are no
outside forces bringing this on. It is
obviously human decision,” he
explained. I

Pennsylvania Department of

'Transportation (PennDot) district

engineer Anthony J. Gaeta re-
quested council accept the existing
arrangement so plans for the new
Brady Street Bridge--which ties

into both streets--can be com-‘

pleted.
Gaeta originally "gave council 30
days to reach» a decision before

_ PennDot would proceed under the

assumption the present ,pattern
would be ‘permanent. »

In yesterday’s appearance before
City Council, Gaeta warned delay
of the project will result in extra
charges by the contractor, but he
said a decision sometime in March
would be satisfactory.

Although Gaeta said the state A

could accept the two-way traffic
pattern, he indicated PennDot
favors the present arrangement.

vHowever, he said, “We will

certainly abide by the council’s

decision.”
Some members of council seemed
concerned a reversal of council’s

v stand would be a sign of weakness '

and expressed resentment of the
deadline atmosphere. . Neverthe-
less, it was pointedout the passage
of time and the adjustment of city

residents and traffic regulations to ‘

the present pattern warrant recon-
sideration of the law.

At yesterday’s meeting, Council-
man Eugene.De Pasquale branded
a recent letter from Gaeta urging
one-way approval a “pack of lies.”

De Pawquale saidpthat at a 1972

public hearing, Gaeta had indi-.

cated ‘PennDot could tolerate
two-way trafﬁc although it pre-
ferred the one-way system. The

Treasury spokesman

councilman has also noted the
Oakland Chamber of Commerce’s
opposition toone-way.

City Planning Director Robert
Paternoster will also discuss
one-way traffic in a council
appearance later this week.

Official Urges ImporlOil Cuts  

BY PETE BUTCH

Undersecretary of the Treasury
for Monetary Affairs, Jack Ben-
nett, was in town Wednesday to
raise support for President Ford’s
economic proposals. He spoke
before the 16th World Affairs
Forum sponsored by the World
Affairs Council of Pittsburgh.
Treasury Secretary William Simon
was scheduled to speak but had to
testify before a congressional
committee in Washington. I

In apress conference before the

speech Bennett said, “Our prob-_

lem is the dependence on imported

- oil and the cost of it. There is no

physical shortage of “oil.” a
Bennett supported the President’s
.$3.00 per barrel oil tariff over
Congress’ gas rationing plan.
Ford’s plan calls for a $.05 per

. gallon increase in crude oil prices,

but the increase at the, pumps
would be returned to the consumer
in the form of an income tax rebate.

Treasury sources predict consum-
ers will not put all of the rebate
back into petroleum, thus fredu,cin_g_

 1-’edu_ce' 'co_n_v_én_ience -and 'r_a,ise

   

“This is’ the optimal plan.” said
Bennett, “for it gives the consumer
a choice, use more gasoline and
pay for it or use less and save the
rebate.” He pointed out a price
increase works, citing last year’s

3% reduction in gas consumption ‘

after the price went up.

Bennett expressed the need for
immediate action. ‘‘If we continue
the way we are now our trade
deﬁcit will increase, weakening the

dollar abroad. The prices on our ‘

imports will increase, putting
inﬂationary pressure on our ex-
ports.” .

Bennett disapproved of Congress’
gas rationing plan calling it “an
unfortunate act against oil conser-
vation.” While the President’s
plan is predicted to raise the
Consumer Price Index two percent
Bennett believes Congress’ plan
will raise it farther. /

“The price at the pumps will not
go up but the quality will go down.
Black market -gasoline will be sold
at exhorbitant prices,” Bennett
said. ’'‘'“Th'e ,; total package 7*will

The Pitt News has learned that a”
conﬂict between Robbins and Little 
Help has been the cause ofthe’
counseling service’s problems this
year, although they can be further‘
traced to last year's allocation

The SG Board, ‘led primarily

refused to fund Little ,Help;at..»th‘e=

When‘ Little Help ran "out of},

Robbins to continue the service, as
did Seman. Diane Linhart, a Little T

involved in the allocations fight this
past year, also denied having
talked to Robbins.

answering service in October, Little
Help wanted to pay the bill, but
Seman discouraged the members,
calling the issue “a matter of
principle.”

“We had told them we didn’t
want the service, so, there was
no reason that we should pay for
it,” Seman said.

At about the same time, the SGB
gave Little Help enough money to
pay a limited-service phone bill of
$10 per month for the rest of the
year. Robbins resumed the service
but later decided that Little Help
was not eligible for the reduced
rate, and charged the group $32.90
per month, reducing the ’group’s
funds to practically nothing.

The $300 the SGB granted’ last
night is tocover the new rate.

Meanwhile, Robbins has given up
trying to collect‘ the $101.40.
Former SGB member Paul Hert-
neky, a supporter of Little Help,
said Robbins has given up because
“he knows that no one really told
him to continue the service during
the summer.”

Bennett was criticized over the

predicted two percent rise in the -

Consumer Index adding more fuel
to the current double digit
inﬂation. '

Gasoline price increases will be
accompanied by cost-rises in
consumer goods and services,
depending on gas.

Bennett pointed out although this

-is true, the index does not account

for the reflow of funds to the
consumer via the tax rebate. This
will greatly increase consumer
buying power.

Ford’s planned release of highway
trust fund money also came under
fire. Since Pennsylvania has to
meet the funds dollar for dollar
with their own funds it was thought
a tax increase would be necessary
to come up with this money.

Bennett stated not all tariff "money
is going to tax rebates. Some of it
is going into revenue sharing which
the states can use to match the
highway trust funds.

Bennett also noted the decrease in '

US oil production. _He said the only

. way to alleviate this situation is to

increase offshore drilling and to
open the naval petroleum reserves.

He also outlined the president’s
plan to tax windfall oil company
profits. “Since this
unexpected temporary increase in
oil company profits the non-

discriminatory thing to do is to
create a temporary tax on these
proﬁts which will be phased out
over the years.”

Bennett favors the Presidents $16
billion tax rebate plan calling it a
moderate approach to cure inflation
and recession. Referring to the
Congressional plan to release "$2 . 0
billion or "labor boss George
Meany’s calling for a release of $30
billion for tax rebates, Bennett said
“I’m concerned that if we’re not
careful we will be creating more
inflation and recession for the
future. The expansionist approach
would only refuel inﬂation.

Camejo claimed the US is subtly
controlled by “a small ruling
aristocracy that own and control
everything. Thesepeople have the
power, but they try to make us
think we run this country, mainly
because we believe we should run
it. This is the biggest hypocrisy.”

The candidate spoke further of the
1776 American Revolution, and
said the “aristocracy _by birth”
which the revolution fought still
exists. ,

“After Socialism, we will have to
set up programs for these people,
like the Rockefellers. They will
have to learn to do many things
--like getting on a bus,” Camejo
said jokingly. ,

Halfway through this speech,
Camejo switched from a theoretical
commentary on the economy to cite
US budget ﬁgures. -

According to Camejo, $94 billion
of the yearly budget goes for
military purposes. “Both the Dem-
ocrats and Republicans refuse to
cut the war budget,” he said, “and
this includes a—number of ‘liberal’
politicians.”

He also cited a S34 billion budget‘

allocation termed ‘interest pay-
ment on bonds’ which he compared
with the $7.3 billion spent on

welfare._ “The government takes
$34 billion from us every year and
gives it to the-wealthy, calling it
interest, yet all anyone complains
about is welfare and not the
interest payments.” _

He alleged the economic leaders
use unemployment and inﬂation to
their own goals without considering
the human consequences. “There
is no more famine in the world, just
murder, because it is now a human
decision,” he said. “We have the

ability to feed the world if we

wanted.” S

Camejo further blamed the “rul-
ing aristocracy” with promoting
racism. “One of the things they are
busy doing is promoting scape-
goatism, primarily towards non-
whites,” he said.

He told the small audience in the

Graduate School of Public Health

auditorium of political "espionage
and sabotage against his campaign
since its inception_.

According to Camejo, CIA and
FBI agentshave trailed him for the
past year and taken photographs of
his supporters. He was arrested in
Atlanta, GA, recently on charges of
disorderly conduct and criminal
trespass when he attempted to
present his views at an economic
conference where President Gerald

Hubbard said the Conference
‘-‘seemed to be more for the Young
Socialist Alliance and the Socialist
Workers Party. It seemed like they

«had the conference stacked.”

Similar complaints were voiced
during the Conference by repre-

groups.

He saw the workshops held
outside of the Conference as
valuable and was pleased, with

reservations, at the decision to hold ‘

the massive May 17 demonstration.
\ “Too much of the time was spent
on preliminary actions and voicing
political ideologies,” he said.
“Nothing really deﬁnite came out
except the May 17 rally.”

But, he added, “if the May__
demonstration is not better

ous.” Hubbard said he planned to
work from Pittsburgh to insure the
success of the demonstration. .

Hubbard was also let down by the
lack of black response he saw from
Pittsburgh. “There were only

representation from all types of

Review Charged

With Ethnic Slurs

Dear Editor:

lresent the thinly veiled ethnic
slurs contained in M.C. Pilecki’s
non-review of Godfather II (Jan.
15).‘

'‘‘If nothing else, Godfather II will
certainly increase the national
consumption of pasta and tomato
sauce. With nothing to do for three
hours and 20 minutes but watch a
horde of Italians gorge themselves
on spaghetti and vino, audiences
are bound to leave the theatres
hungry. For plot if, not for food.”

Words such as “horde” and
“gorge”. connote vivid subhuman
imagery reinforcing the popular
stereotype of an Italian as one who
could casually murder a man in his
livingroom and sit down to dinner
with his large family in the kitchen.

The review is without a focal
point, vague and poorly organized.
Pilecki not only fails to carefully
analyze the film but also never tells
us why she does not like it. Plot
and characterization are dealt with
in a cursory manner, while theme,
allegorical significance, casting
and editing are completely ignored.
I feel that because of the review’s
lack of substance, Pilecki resorted
to padding the article with
“clever" comments about‘ Italians.

I did, however, agree with one of
Pilecki’s statements--the average
theatre seat IS torturously uncom-
fortable. ‘ p

Franco M. F edeli

Machine Games

Vlctlmlze_Campus
Dear Editor, ‘ - . ‘P ‘
There’s a game around campus ’

that everyone can and does play.

When you win, you don’t ‘really _

come out ahead, and when you
lose, everything goes, including
your cool. You think it’s pinball,
right? Wrong. It’s a game called
Screw-O-Matic, and hundreds of
students are victimized by its cold,
unyielding “change return” slot.
Twice was all it took for me to
realize what was" going on. A
person deposits his last quarter in
the candy, tbeverage, milk ma-

‘ or $.30.

 

 

chine, etc., (soda is now $.30 a can)
and hopes to receive some meager
foodstuff for his offering. If by

some malfunction the machine.

doesn’t dispense either the treat or
the deposited change, the in-
structions are to take all complaints
to the Tuck Shop or - the SU
information desk.

So I went to the SU desk and
asked for reimbursement expecting
to receive another quarter or dime,
etc. Instead of getting any change,
I was told to put my name and
address on a piece of paper and the
money would be mailed to me. I
was stunned, among other things.
My last piece of change is swallow-
ed up by a sick vending machine,

_and the desk attendant says that

they’ll.mail it "back to me? It was
hard to keep a straight face.

OK, figure it out. . Screw-O-Matic
gets this complaint for $.15, $.25,
Naturally their con-
sciences bother them and so they
rush to mail you their check for
$.25. The postage will cost them a
dime, and they have to pay
someone to handle the complaint,

so they’re losing, money. Under- .

stand? Its been a month since I
ﬁled my last complaint. g
Actually, the machines probably
have a pretty good record of proper
operation. It’s the frustration that
comes from 1o_sing money to a
company that cleans-up‘ on these
machines; and the University,
(hands over hearts, everyone) must
endorse“ this inane practice. It

‘might be interesting to find out

how many people who use the

vending machines lose money and i

don’t have it returned. Remember,

A Strange Twist

To Baird Speech

Dear Editor,

In an article in the February 12
Pitt News on the recent visit of Bill
Baird, “nationally known abortion
rights advocate” to the Pitt
campus, it seemed as if most of his
concerned with the
intimate details of a local Byzantine
priestfs affair ‘with a woman
parishoner. The affair resulted in

' the birth of a mongoloid daughter

to the woman, whom the priest
married but left behind to cope for
herself when he was transferred to
Canada. _

It was a tragic story but Mr.

'Baird’s revelation at . a public
meeting of the details of other '

persons’ sex lives, with an
accompanying cry for vindictive

action, was reminiscent of nothing

so much as the cruel Puritan mores
recounted in Hawthorne’s The
The situation is
reversed now as Mr. Baird
represents the anti-religion force
harrassing the. “sinners” whereas
Hawthorne attributed it to the
people of the church. What a
Will charity and
understanding never reign?

The fact is that immediate action
is necessary. We cannot wait for a
panacealike solar power or nuclear
fusion to solve our ills.‘ We need
legislation.

Both plans have inherent prob-
-lems. The President’s plan is
unfair to poorer consumers, since
increased fuel costs will’ take a
bigger bite out of their budget.
Rationing is too complicated,
requiring much lawmaking and
paper work to get it in gear. It also
opens the door for black market
gasoline sales.

Both plans try to make gasoline
undesirable to the consumer to
reduce consumption. But neither
offers an alternate solution to using
gasoline. »

The solution is developing and
improving mass transit.

The days of cheap power are over.

The administration 'should put a.
tax on foreign oil- to reduce

consumption and then use this tax ‘

money to improve mass transit
across the nation. The money freed
from the highway trust fund should
also be used for this. . , -
- The time is ripe for legislation like
this. It is obvious that Congress is
going to delay the Presidents tariff
and override any veto of their
delay. Yet, _ if Congress tries to
pass any rationing law, not enough
support’ will be mustered to
override a Ford veto. A deadlock
will occur- and this is , when
Congress and the administration
should- get together and agree to
put a tax on gasoline and use these

funds for improving and expanding-

mass transit.

This idea is not a cure-all. People
would use their cars a lot less‘ and
buy a new one less often. The auto
industry would suffer. But with
mass transit, being. created I and

in production could not be avoided.

.The auto industry could be,
contracted to develop and supply,

new forms of mass transit, and

maintain it for years to come. On '

the whole the economy would
receive a boost.

But, most important, American
ideals must change. The ability to
get into a car and, drive 100 or 200
miles must no longer be considered
a luxury, ‘privilege, and status
symbol. This status. symbol of
driving 100 miles results in the
waste of gallons of precious fuel.

BY KEN GORMLEY

(Washington)--Did you ever think
of running ‘for President? That’s
r'ight...of the US of A. Probably
not. You probably think you aren’t
famous enough, rich enough, or
devious enough to stand a chance

/‘grainst the ﬂashy, quick-talking

prima donnas of the political scene.

Mo Udall is in the same boat as
you--but he’s giving it a try. And a
"pretty good try at that.

Who is this Mo guy? One of the
Three Stooges? An Arabian
oil-rich sheik? N0. M0 Udall is a
member of the House of Represen-
tatives, from Arizona. No wonder
you never heard of him.

Wait a minute. Who are you
trying to kid? There’s nothing
spectacular about someone from
the House becoming President.
Gerry Ford was a Representative in
the House before he took the
presidency out of the hands of the

/"",‘%;,~,.1_e great Richard Nixon.

True. But only one member of the

House has been ELECTED to the ,

nation’s top post, and that was

James Garﬁeld in 1881. So if Mo"

Udall succeeds in becoming Presi-
dent in 1976, it will make a rare
event in American history.

Udall is a big guy, about six foot

  Prudentstdent 
 .00 Rebate if you
  Reserve before

ﬁve. As a matter of fact, he played
pro basketball for the Denver
Nuggets to send himself through
law school. Sitting in his humble
little Washington office, with cacti
around to remind him of home,
Udall looked a little tired. Hitting
the campaign trail three days a
week would take its toll on anyone.

But as soon as questions
concerning his bid for President
were fired at him, his face lit up.
There’s a whole country full of
people who need to find out who he
is and why he has this crazy notion
of becoming President. And Mo
Udall is all set to tell them.

‘‘I have a theory that the worst
Presidents are those who want to
become President the worst,” he

said leaning back in his chair.
“What the Democratic Party really
wants and the country really wants
is someone who can go through the
ordeal but doesn’t really want the
job as much as someone like
Nixon.”

This theory may seem inconsis-
tent with the fact that Udall was the
first Democrat to formally an-
nounce his Presidential bid in ’76.
But there’s a simple explanation.
Twenty-nine House Democrats,‘
most of them liberals, signed a
petition asking Udall to run.

So without a desperate craving for
the ofﬁce, Udall is doing his best
not to let his colleagues down. And
if victory is» going to become a
reality, the tall Arizonan knows he

g;

V Friday, February 21, l975——T HE PITT NEWS—Page 5

Ma Udall: Everyman for President

has to make himself known.

This isn’t to imply that Udall is
only running because his fellow
House members have asked him to.
Not at all. Mo Udall thinks he has
a lot to offer the American people.
The “lower” House Congressman
sees the country taking an entirely
new direction, and feels this is
exactly the direction he’s been
pointing to for many years.

“The nation’s going into a new
era. I think my record--early
awareness of the environmental

‘and energy problems, and big role

in the Campaign Reform Bill--show
I’m on the forward edge of some of
the directions our country wants to

go.”
But what about the fact that only_

 

one House member has been

elected President? Doesn’t it scare
Udall that the odds of history are
working against him? ‘
“No. History is always teaching
us new things. I find that being a‘
House member has a lot of
advantages. And the House
Judiciary Committee (which drew

up articles of impeachment against

ex-President Nixon) proved this.
People say ’Hell, there is talent in
there.’ ”

And Udall is certainly one of those

who has consistently demonstrated»

a talent for progressive leadership.
In 1967, the Arizona Congressman
became one of the first Democratic

backing him, it doesn’t seem
there’s much that could stop the
Presidential hopeful in his bid for
that ol‘ﬁce...that is if you call other
Democratic candidates like Senator
Henry “Scoop” Jackson of Wash-
ington, and Texas Senator-million-
aire Lloyd Benson “not much.”

Besides, if he gets past that
hurdle, there’s still President Ford,
who will undoubtedly get the
Republican nomination in 1976,
especially if he gets the economy
rolling by then.

Don't worry, if Ford gets the
nation back on its feet in the next
year or so, insigniﬁcant people like
Udall will fade graciously out of the
picture, won’t they?

“I like President Ford’s approach.
I give him credit for eliminating

some of the regal atmosphere
around the Presidency. And his
openness and willingness to give
interviews have brought a measure
of democracy and plainness to the
ofﬁce.”

Aha. Just as we suspected. ~ It
looks like Udall will back out of the
race if Gerry Ford is successful. If
he likes Ford’s simple style that
much, he obviously isn’t much
different save that he’s a Demo-
crat, and he’s only running because
he expects Ford to fail.

“But my philosophical differences ,

with the President wouldn’t be
eliminated." We have to get the
economy revived...and even if the
President did, there is a whole
range of policy where we have
some basic disagreements.”
“President Ford has been very
weak on the environment, he has
been against consumer interests,
he wants to raise the price of food
stamps, and wants to get back in
Southeast Asia. The strength I
have is that I’m a new face
prepared to try‘ new ideas.”. '
So it looks like Mo‘ Udall is in the
race to stay. And he claims that
although he isn’t as well known as
he would like to be yet, he has a
bigger following , than Eugene

McCarthy did at this time before ‘

the 1972 election. Since many
people liken Udall to ‘the liberal
Senator McCarthy, that may be a
good omen. -

You might wonder if a simple
member of the House would be

able to go through, some of the’

traumatic" experiences a President
must face, without losing his

Arizona cool. Let’s put it this way.
Anyone who can lose one eye at the
age of six and go on to play pro
basketball, be a successful lawyer
and Congressman, and kid about
his eye as much as Peter F alk, must
be able to cope with pressure.

In an interview with The New
York Times, Udall claimed his
finest athletic hour came when he
organized a team at Fort Douglas,

The_ use of phoney credit cards, electronic devices or any other means to avoid
paying for phone calls IS against the law. It’s stealing——pure and simple.

in this state, conviction for making fraudulent phone calls may result in:

I Up to seven years in jail
I Restitution for the total cost of the fraud
I court costs

One more thing: modern electronic computer systems are being used to track down

Reviewing Reviewers

Rough Drciughts 5

BY HARRIS LEVY

Reviewers are only human. Now before all you humans take offense,
let me explain: reviewers have biases and are subject to fads the same
as everyone else. A few examples from recent book reviews should
demonstrate that sometimes, there’s a lot more going on than meets
the eye, ,

Nobody really enjoys reviewing bad art. The better and more .

important the work of art, the more important the reviewer feels. Also,
the reviewers don’t want to conclude that their era is inferior to the
past because that might reflect on them too. H 7
So, if there isn’t a great artist working in a certain ﬁeld, critics make
one. Take Woody Allen. I like Woody Allen but he doesn’t compare to

3"“‘~Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton.

But critics are reluctant to admit that our time doesn’t- have a comic
who compares with the silent film «greats. They ignore the demise of
vaudeville, the training ground that gave Chaplin, Keaton, the Marx
Brothers and the rest years to polish up their act and create a persona.

So they put Allen right up there with Chaplin and Keaton and he’s
simply not that good; his deficiencies lie not in his ideas so much as his

lack of physical grace, a quality that Chaplin and Keaton took years to ‘

develop.

Now for aliterary example. We just don’t have a current equivalent

to the great detective novelists Dashiell Hammett and Raymond
As with movie comics, certain intangible circumstances

But this didn’t stop critics from saying that Ross Macdonald was as
good as Chandler and Hammett. When The Goodbye,I.ook (1969) was
published, the New York Times Book Review writer called Macdonald
a better novelist than Chandler and Hammett. Macdonald’s next book
The Underground Man (1971) received front page acclaim in the Times
Book Review and critics troop_ed out all the ‘important American
novelist’ bullshit. _ .

By the time of Sleeping Beauty‘ (1973), the critics realized that they
had gone overboard in praising The Underground Man. The two
novels are very similar but critics over-reacted the other way and tore
into Sleeping Beauty. .. - - -

Don’t getme wrong. I like Ross Macdonald. But he’s neither as good
as critics claimed he was in 1971 or as bad as they said he was in 1973.
All the critical praise may have hurt Macdonald’s work--his last two

ilﬂye-..—._books suffer from their ambitiousness; they are unsuccessful at

integrating topical material with the mystery plot.‘

Moving right along.

Joseph Heller is like the Macdonald case in reverse. His second
novel, Something Happened (1974) received a lot of praise. But I think
a lotof it was inspired by guilt feelings and awe for his Catch-22 (1961).
Reading the reviews, I got the impression that some critics were afraid
to admit they didn’t like Something Happened.

I‘had this really crazy chemistry
teacher when I was in 11th grade.
She had this pheasant in a closet

.and she used to go cry with it.

She’d be walking around the
classroom and suddenly she'd hit
us with “Bill, I know you hate
me!”

Well, one day before class, a
friend of mine, inspired by Frank
Zappa’s “Call Any Vegetable,”
started making fun of rutabagas

.' and other plants. And our chemis-

try teacher really let him have it as
she defended the vegetables.
Maybe she wasn’t _so crazy. Read
a book like The Secret Life of Plants
and you’ll reexamine your ideas
about plants. I’m personally skep-

tical about ESP, ﬂying saucers and -

the like so I don’t buy everything
that the authors sayin showing that
“plants are living, breathing, com-

,municating creatures, endowed‘

with personality and the attributes
of soul.”

Sometimes critics judge the author instead of the book. “It is getting
crowded these days on the island of Lesbos,” smirked, the New

passage from the book and claimed it was typical. I couldn’t believe it.

series between Pitt and Penn State.

in the first meeting which was the
consolation game of the Steel. B_owl

_on a night when they shot well
above 50 per cent, just barely V

topping the tired Panther squad.
 the second meeting, things

.\_

turned out as expected as the Cats
ran circles around the dazed Lions
en route to an 84-56 victory in Pitt
Fieldhouse. However, tomorrow
night the Lions will have the home
court advantage and since the Cats
have only won one . game on the
road, this year, a squeaker over
weak Temple, the contest should
be hotly disputed. .

The Lions are currently 10-10 and

have evened their record by win- _

ning their ‘last three games. Most
recently, the Penn State squad
upset West ‘Virginia Wednesday
night 66-64 in Morgantown. Previ-

usly, they "topped .Army' and

 éolgate with both ‘games held in

Rec Hall on ‘the University Park"

campus. ‘

The Lion squad has undergone a
bit of shake-up since they visited
Pittsburgh on January 18. They
have two new starters in their
line-up, both sophomores, who
have contributed substantially to

BY G.W. STEVENS

The Pitt basketball team com-
pleted their home schedule Wed-
nesday night with an easy 80-65
victory over the Purple Eagles of
Niagara University. The win
clinches a perfect record on the
Fitzgerald ﬂoorfor the second year
in ‘a row. It was the Cats’ 25th
consecutive win at home and their
ninth’ win in the last ten‘ games.

The Panthers got off to a fast start

against the Eagles, which prettyl

much decided the ' ﬁnal result.
Behind the shooting of senior Kirk
Bruce and Lew Hill, who were
playing in their ﬁnal home game of

their college careers, Pitt grabbed

, an early 17-4 lead. Hill and Bruce

contributed six points to the ‘early
explosion while Keith Starr and
Tom Richards also found the nets.

‘Johnny DeFazio is still peforming
well in goal for Pitt with an overall.-

,2.00 goals against average and one’

shutout. DeFazio has allowed -but
1.28 goals per game in league play,

“We are expecting many smaller"

schools such as Frostburg, Edin-

“We’ve had a ' very good re-
sponse.” ' '

A lot of small colleges simply have
little or no facilities for track (and it
is‘ prety poor running in pouring
rain or a small blizzard or maybe in
a gym not big enough to be called

These institutions want the com-
petition and are willing to travel to
Pitt to compete.

A win in one of the -first two

absolutely crucial before the match

where Penn State has had a lot of
success this season. "

“If there is one flaw to be found in

Walker with eight, Watson with

Bob Pasternak S

BY JIM SPANOS

Rob Pasterick’s position on the
Pitt gymnastics team is unlike
anyone else’s. For one thing, he’s
the leading all-around man in
scoring. For another, he’s the team
'-—~ captain, and what it all adds up to
is that he’s the guy the team turns

to when things get tough. "
“He’s the whole foundation that
we base our team on,”. says

Pasterick’s coach lg Perez. _“He’s .

the one guy you can say is most
responsible for turning the pro-
gram around.” . ~

The sophomore from Belle Vernon
High School has transformed the
Pitt gymnastics team from a patsy
to a team which can compete with
the best schools. This is not to
negate the performances of the
other Pitt gymnasts, but the ability
of Pasterick to consistently score 50

\_ points is phenomenal.

M “ “Rob’s excellent, a good organi-
zer, and a very‘ dependable per-
son,” Perez noted, “and he’s the
most coachable'~ kid I’ve ever
worked with.”

‘The most spectacular of Rob’s
routines is the floor exercise, in
which he does a double-back
sommersault, a most difﬁcult trick.
But Pasterick won’t allow himself
to\live from the glory because of it.

“The biggest thing in my mind is
being equally proﬁcient in all six
events,” he said. Concerning the

double-back, he says, ‘‘I ﬁnally
have a trick that not many people
cando. It’s very hard, and it makes
me feel good that 1 can accomplish
something that difficult.”

“The biggest thing in my mind is

being equally "proﬁcient in’all six
events,” ‘he said. Concerning the
double-back, he says, “I ﬁnally
have"a trick that not many people
can do. It’s very hard, and it makes
me feel good that I can accomplish
something that difficult.” .
_His high mark of 52.80 points is
third‘best in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Gynmastics League, which
is amazing considering Pasterick’s
sophomore status. Many gymnasts
dream a lifetime about, doing so
well. but for Pasterick there are
still accomplishments for which to
Strive. ‘ '

One such goal is to be more
consistent. The event which has
been the Achilles tendon for Pas-
terick has been\the pommel horse,

which gives many gymnasts severe

problems. But the horse is not the
extent of his concerns.

As he dressed for practice earlier
this week, he commented on the
fact that the athletic department
turned down the team’s request for
an assistant coach. You won’t ﬁnd
many large schools without an

_do now because he has to be at P

"K . . -
.,>_.__ ,,

assistant coach, and Pasterick was
understandably annoyed.
‘‘I don’t know who to be mad at.

This team needs‘ an assistant‘
coach,” he says, and the tone of his

voice becomes more vibrant. ‘‘It
would help out a lot, andwould also
enable lg to recruit, which he can’t

practice.”
Many things appear illogical to

Pasterick, but they occur regular-"I

ly. For example, twice this season
the gymnasts have had ‘a meet on
Friday night followed by one on
Saturday afternoon. A gymnast is
only as good as his hands, and
meets on two consecutive "days
destroy them.

“Maybe we’re going to show
everyone that even’ with all the
hassles we’re still going to pro-
duce,” he maintains.

This Pitt team has produced
better than any Pitt team in many
years, scoring consistently in’ the
l80’s this season, though’ not
winning" any meets. But the im-
provement from last year has been
remarkable. '

Gymnastics is life, and life is
gymnastics for Pasterick during the
season, and he’s quite certain of
the role gymnastics will have after
he graduates.

Penguins In Big Resurgence

 

BY CONNIE GIEL

As far as progress reports go, the
Pittsburgh Penguins are gaining.
On what and how fast is anybody’s
guess. Coach Marc Boileau, for the
first time in recent months, doesn’t
have to resort to fancy French-
Canadian talking to explain the
Pens’ record. It plainly speaks for
itself.

Pittsburgh’s 25-20-13 compilation
is the best for any third place team.
Just in case someone says “so
what?” Boileau is fast with some
statistics. “At this time Iast'year,
58 games gone, we were 18-34-6. I
see considerable improvement just
in that fact.”

Boileau has an answer for every-
thing. “There’s lots of room for
improvement on this club,” the
feisty Frenchman said. “A lot of

‘things have changed just in the last
few games. Seven or eight games

  

ago, we were giving up an average
of « three goals each game. Now
we’ve cut that to one or two. At the
same time, we’ve been getting
goals ourselves. That says’ to me
that we’re doing something right.”

The walking hockey encyclopedia
doesn’t miss much. He is right
when he says the Pens have to
-come up after approaching the
bottom. Last year’s final record
was 28-41.-9 for 65 points. During
the ’73-’74 season the Pens scored
242 goals and got burnt for a club
high of 273.

Thus far they have scored 231
goals, 65 more than last year’s 58
game mark of 166. At the same
time last year, 212 goals had been
scored’ against Pittsburgh, only 5
more than the current 207.

While much has been made of the
Penguins’ attempts to slice, a great
deal from that hefty total of last
season, not much has been done.

“We don’t worry about keeping the
goals against down,” Boileau said.
“Our job is to win hockey games,
and you doﬂthat ﬁrst by scoring. It
is always _ nice to the keep the
averages under control, but that
comes with a total team effort. It’s
not someting that depends on just
the defense or the goalies.

“You have to realize that this year

we play 80 games instead of 78 or .

74 like before. The numbers are
bound to go up. To compare the
points to what we did at some other
time tells very little.’’

Some numbers, Boilear admits,
may tell the story, even though a
paragraph or two may be left out.
“Look,” he says. “You want an
indication of the kind of job we’re
doing? Look at Gary Inness and
Michel Plasse. -Gary was 3.86 for a
while. Now he’s 3.46 and Michel is
3.56. L ' p A

people we are having trouble
defensively, that we are giving up
_too many goals for the averages to
be like that. But I say that’s not
what it means. Sure, we weren’t
doing well defensively--as a team.

That was at first. But now, now we «-

are a better checking club. The
point is that the averages for the
goaltenders are down, an indica-
tion of a good defensive job.” ,

As for the still imposing goals
against ﬁgure, Boileau is’conﬁde‘n't
of the team’s ability to hang tough.

“If we have 2 goals scored against
us in each of the 22 games left, we
still wouldn’t reach that total of
273. So whyzworry about it? I look
at it this way: What other club has
nine forwards with 20 ' goals?
(None: Bob Kelly and Ron Schock
have 19 goals each). How about
that?” ' a
