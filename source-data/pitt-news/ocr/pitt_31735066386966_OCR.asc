Jewish Awareness Wee

By Rebecca Baker
Staﬂ’ Writer

A touch of Israel came to
the William Pitt Union as
Jewish students danced to the
music of their heritage last
night to kick off Jewish
Awareness Week at both Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon
University.

“Line dancing is a big thing
in Israel right now,” said Hillel
Executive Director Art
Donsky, as a dozen students
tried to keep in step with the
leader. .“It’s a fun  commu-
nal type of activity.”

One dance the students
learned was called Hopahey,
and the music was taken from
an Israeli children’s television
show.

“We want to create a very
celebratory recognition of
Jewish life today,” Donsky
said.

“The focus of Awareness
Week is a positive one,”
he said.

“[We’re] trying to help
empower and engage stu-
dents on campus to take part
in the week’s events.”

“Jewish pride and identity is
based on positive experi-
ences,” Donsky said. “Jews in
America have succeeded.”

But Donsky later said when

Clinton's
ﬁnancial
aid policy
Will not
affect Pitt

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Attempting to promote diver-
sity on American college cam-
puses and make up for past dis-
crimination in the federal finan-
cialaid process, the Clinton
administration announced last
Thursday that it will allow col-
lege scholarships to be award-
ed on the basis of race.

The new policy, which will
allow the scholarships to con-
tinue at schools that receive
federal aid, requires the schools
to comply with anti—discrimina-
tion laws. According to last
Friday’s New York Times, race-
based scholarships currently
account for only about 3 per-
cent‘ of all student scholarships
awarded.

Pitt Director of Admissions
and Financial Aid Betsy Porter
said the new policy would not
strongly affect Pitt since the
awards in question only make
up a small portion of the uni-
versity’s total scholarship base.

“It will affect us very little,”
Porter said. “We have very few

_ scholarships awarded totally on
race.”

Pitt is preparing to make its final choice
on the site for the proposed convocation
center, but few current students should
expect to receive their diploma in the new
$35 million complex.

“Right now we are still in the feasibility
stage,” said Bob Reteshka of University
Relations. “No site has been chosen. The
university is still studying several sites.”

According to the five-, 10- and 20-year
master plans for campus expansion
released by the Senate Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee last September, the

university is considering three sites for the
new convocation center.

“Pedestrian walking patterns, vehicle
traffic patterns and overall feasibility are
all being studied right now,” Reteshka
said.

According to Reteshka, no decision on
the location of the convocation center will
be made until all of the studies are com-
plete.

Two of the convocation center locations
would keep the building on the upper part
of Pitt’s campus, where most university ath-
letic facilities are already located. These
sites include the OC lot adjacent to the Pitt
Stadium and the football practice field

behind the Cost Center.

Along with the proposal of the site beside
the stadium comes the possibility of con-
necting Trees Hall, Fitzgerald Field House
and Salk Hall through the convocation cen-
ter in addition to a concourse joining it
to the stadium. A possible complication
with the OC lot proposal is the current
presence of several fraternity houses at the
site.

The other possible location is the
Schenley parking lot between the Carnegie
and Forbes Quad, across from the
Cathedral of Learning. Problems with the
Schenley site’s construction, as proposed,

See Center, page 4

Porter said the policy is fair
since no money would be
"taken away from other need-
based or merit-based scholar-
ships.

“We’re an institution that’s
attempting to diversify  in an
effort to do that we’re making
available awards that are attrac-
tive to students who need
ltheml,” Porter said. “These are
not funds that are taken from
pools of money that other stu-
dents would use.”

Law students handle cases at new Health Law Clinic

Byjohn B. Moore
Staﬂ’ Writer

The denial of health care beneﬁts from programs like
Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies. is
a tragic reality to many. But when a person is then
unable to legally pursue the government and private
companies in the hopes of regaining the lost beneﬁts,
the problem intensiﬁes.

Recognizing this problem, the University of
Pittsburgh School of Law has established the Health
Law Clinic.

Receiving funds from the U.S. Department of
Education, the Health Law Clinic provides free legal
services to impoverished persons who have had health
care beneﬁts denied.

The clinic, which opened on Jan. 10, is staffed by 10

third-year law students who have been certiﬁed by the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court to represent consenting
clients. They are supervised by Stella Smetanka
and Karen Engro, assistant clinical professors of law at
Pitt.

Receiving seven credits for their work at the clinic,
the law students meet for seven hours a week in the
classroom and then must work at least six hours a
week in the clinic, talking to clients, meeting with doc-
tors and researching medical histories.

“Clinical experience is a good thing for last-year law
students,” said Smetanka.

“We advise that {the students] only take two other
courses during the semester. Some are also holding
down part-time positions at law firms.”

The services provided by the law students mainly
deal with cases involving denial of benefits through

Medicare, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income
programs, managed care programs and private insur-
ance contracts.

“The students come from all different perspectives of
health care. One student was even a nurse  we’re all
helping the disabled and people with health care
needs,” said Smetanka.

Although the Health Law Clinic is there to help oth-
ers, it has set out to target children with AIDS, the frail
elderly, pregnant women and people with disabilities
as clients.

“Pittsburgh has a great need [for the clinic], with its
changing population,” said Smetanka. “The Health Law
Clinic is a natural follow-up to some of the other clin-
ics.”

Smetanka said the health care debates during last

Change is a first step in getting "unstuck"

All of us get stuck at various
points in our lives. For instance,
we get ourselves into unhappy
relationships, unsatisfying jobs
or engage in unproductive
habits. We stall with our acade-
mic work and can’t seem to find
the motivation to get going
again. We become depressed, or
anxious or develop other psy-
chological problems. We drink
too much. We feel isolated from
others. We are too unassertive to
ask for what we want. We get
immobilized by fear of failure.
We have no plan for the future,
and in a hundred other ways we
get ourselves into situations that
are unhealthy and characterized
by inertia.

To get “unstuck” we need to
overcome our resistance to
change. Frequently, it takes a
major life event to precipitate
change. It may be a serious ill-

ness that scares us into changing
our health habits or even our
way of relating to people. It may
be a buildup of many frustra-
tions that becomes too much to

person hits bottom (i.e. until the
negative consequences are so
terrible that one’s survival is
threatened).

Signiﬁcant change need not be

we ‘blow up”
or get angry.
We may even
make deci-
sions such as

ship.

it necessary for
us to wait until

or psychologi-
cally. What is
needed, as
with so many
other things

Because this is the way change
often occurs, many of us come
to believe that we can’t change
without going through some
pain or suffering. In fact it is a
common but erroneous belief
that a person can’t change a neg-
ative behavior pattern until the

that involve personal growth, is
a change in attitude.

We need to begin defining
things differently and not allow
our View of change to be gov-
erned by old stereotypes. For
instance, we can redeﬁne what it
means to “hit bottom.” We can

define it, for example, as the
time when we make a conscious
decision to change directions
and to make our lives happier,
healthier, more creative or more
successful than they have ever
been.

We can choose to change, and
we can begin whenever we
please. Making this decision to
change is the critical first step in
getting “unstuck” in our lives.
Most of us know which aspects
of ourselves are getting in the
way of us achieving our goals.
We need to get beyond aware-
ness and develop a plan for
making the necessary changes.

There are many obstacles to
change. Some are external, but
most are intemal. In my next col-
umn, I’ll talk about how one of
these internal obstacles, low self-
esteem, inhibits our initiative to
make changes. '

Jewish

Continued from page 1
open discussion about
“Choosing to be Jewish,” and a
ski trip to Seven Springs resort.
About 20 students from Pitt
and CMU planned all of the
events for Jewish Awareness
Week.

The Beehive cinema, as
part of a non-related Israeli
film festival, will show a docu-
mentary about a group of
African-American teenagers
who lived in Israel for three
months. African-American and
Jewish leaders plan to hold a
discussion immediately follow-
ing the film Sunday night and
another lecture entitled “Blacks
and Jews: A Reassessment” will
be held earlier that day in Mt.
Lebanon.

Donsky said all the activities
during Jewish Awareness Week
are open to African-American
students, despite recent ten-
sions between black and
Jewish communities which
were sparked by anti-semitic
comments from Louis
Farrakkan.

“I think there’s a mispercep-
tion of the relationship
between blacks and Jews,”
Donsky said. “[The problem is]
each group doesn’t have
enough contact with the other
group.”

“We have enough shared
experiences,” Donsky added,
“since both groups have suf-
fered a great deal of persecu-
tion and genocide.”

“When we went to the

Holocaust Museum a few
weeks ago,” Donsky explained,
“there were people from
Campus Women’s Organiza-
tion, BiGALA and the Black
Action Society, all in one van.”

“To those who hold Judaism
as their identification, this is a
chance to see what it means
and how it influences what
they do on a daily basis,”
Donsky said.

One student attending the
dance holds Judaism as more
than just a part of his back-
ground. Pitt senior Jonathan
Weinkle said he hopes to move
to Israel immediately after he
graduates this semester. After
living in the country for nine
months, he said he felt at home
there.

“It’s an incredibly beautiful
country,” Weinkle said, “and I
was raised with a concern
about its society."

“There’s a conflict with being
Jewish in the United States,” he
added, “and I have a spiritual
connection about [Israel] that I
just don’t have here.”

The week of events is spon-
sored in part by the Jewish
Community Relations Commit-
tee, the Pittsburgh Jewish
Community in Squirrel Hill and
Hillel, a national collegiate
Jewish organization that has
over 100 chapters throughout
the country.

There are over 2,000 Jewish
graduate and undergraduate
students at the University of
Pittsburgh, Donsky said.

Scholarships

Continued from page 1
Times, the Bush administration
attempted to discontinue race-
oriented scholarships in 1991,
stating that scholarships should
be given out based only on
merit. Opposition from civil
rights and academic leaders
kept the administration from
banning the scholarships out-
right.

Leading educators at predom-
inantly black institutions such
as Howard University in
Washington, D.C. favor the new
scholarship policy, according to

the New Yorle Times.

“It has an impact," Howard
University president Dr.

Concerned parents hurt country

The volatile health care debate is now facing a major
hurdle that may hold up the whole works.

The new hurdle is an old problem. The never-ending
abortion debate, which by now has very little new to
add to politics, may make its next contribution to the
American political scene by locking up the chances for
real health care reform.

USA Today reports that both sides of the abortion
debate are mobilizing their forces in order to make
sure their agenda is carried out in legislation.

Planned Parenthood is launching a ten-million-dollar
advertising campaign in order to. make sure congress
provides for two things. They want congress to allo-
cate health-care money for birth control and they also
want the health—care plan to pay_ for abortions.

Concerned Women for America, the largest women’s
group in America comprised of 600,000 members, is
pushing to extract promises from senators. They want
the senators to pledge not to vote for any health-care
reform bill that covers abortions.

What we are seeing again is an old debate which has
raged on without any decisive result. What is at stake
here is the health of this entire nation. The United
States has the highest health-care costs of the entire
industrialized world. The obscene costs of health care
are hurting the entire country on several levels. The
costs are hurting our international competitiveness and
productivity levels. A healthy population is the best
asset this country could have. Health-care reform is the
answer.

Both of these groups claim they are trying to help
the women of this country. One must wonder if that is
their true goal. Instead of helping all women obtain a
higher standard of living and better health care, they
are willing to throw the whole issue of health—care
reform into gridlock over this one issue. The outra-
geous thing is that there is not even a consensus of
opinion throughout either group.

How can this country allow people to remain unin-
sured and be forced into dire economic straits because
of health care over a single issue. It is a gross abuse of
our system that these two groups, simply because of
their command of political resources, can hurt so many
people by ending chances of health—care reform.

Can we allow this important issue, which will
already take years to resolve, be held up by two spe-
cial-interest groups? What the citizens of this country
are faced with is a case of two groups shaping the
entire future of the nation. The focus on more substan-
tive issues is lost in a highly emotional debate. This is

not only undemocratic, but also just plain foolish. Both‘

groups should take a minute to realize the irnmensely—
improved benefits all women will receive with the pas-
sage of reform.

Weather shows the city nature's Ways

I used to laugh at people who claimed the
weather was the source of their moodiness, now
I cry right along with them.

Never before have I been so delighted to catch
an occasional glimpse of the sun. Let’s face it, if
it’s cold and dreary outside, you feel pretty lousy
inside. To constantly have a view of gray clouds
and white snow instead of brilliant blue and
green must have an impact on one’s dreary

mood.To see the sun was a blessing indeed.»

Those are the days I live for. The sun, the air,
the breeze — it reminds you what it feels like to
be alive. That feeling can some-

by building windows with limited Views.

The weather, in a sense, controls us. We are,
seemingly, mere puppets peering out of win-
dows waiting for the next cloudburst. Sorry, that

l was a bit deep. Ice does that to you.

Did you ever relish a summer rainstorm? Just
kinda stand there, not caring if you get soaked? ?
Nature knows just when to douse us in good old
rain, or at least it seems to. Then why do we
have to put up with blizzards, ice storms and
sub-zero temperatures? Maybe so we won’t get
too spoiled. Maybe so we can learn to appreci-
ate the sun. Did you ever think

times be muddled in the haziness
of summer or the dreariness of
winter. We are, indeed, veiy con-
nected to the weather — more so
than we usually admit. I mean,

that the climate in which we live

ever notice how in the North, we
tend to slur our speech, while in
the South they drag it out? People

how many people say when you
ask them “What’s wrong?” answer, “Well, it’s too
cloudy, too sunny, too cold, too wet  Sure
some people answer that way, but most simply
shrug it off. It makes one wonder how separate
we truly are from things natural. We become
unfocused living in a city, where it’s rare to see a
couple of trees, but the weather is unavoidable.

I was looking out of a window in the
Cathedral. It was a dreary day, and I was glad to

relaxed, instead of hustle and bustle. The weath-

I’m not saying everyone experiences these
phenomena, but I sure do. I thought I’d never
come out of my depressed state a couple of
weeks ago. It turned out all I needed was a bit
of sunlight. I’ll never wear sunglasses again, the
sun is way too precious. Besides, there are how
many more weeks of winter? Now there’s a
depressing thought. I wonder if anyone’s consid-
ered bribing that groundhog.

Ignorance of the Holocaust shows lack of concern

I recently saw the movie
Schindler’s List, directed by
Steven Spie1berg.It was one of
those movies that you see that
was so depressing you never
want to see it again. Schindlers
List is'not only about the

I Holocaust it also is an example

of man’s cruelty to man.

This movie comes out at an
appropriate time. It coincides
with a recent poll stating that
about 20 percent of Americans
don’t know the Holocaust
existed (The Pitt News). This
disturbed me. Even though all
of the people that fought in the
Civil War are dead, do we say
the Civil War never existed?
The Holocaust is a big part of
the history of the world. Not
only were six million Jews
killed, but so were another six
million Catholics, Gypsies,
Russians and Poles.

The movie runs for about
three-and-a-half hours and is

shown in black-and-white in
order to show that there was
no hope in the concentration
camps. The main character,
Oskar Schindler, is a Czech-
born German who starts out
having no concern for the Jews
but ends up helping them.

Marc Miller

He did not do this because of
religion or nationality.
Schindler did this because he
was human. He saw what was
going on as wrong and used
his inﬂuence to make a differ-
ence.

We live in a society where
some of the people want to
live in harmony with all races
and religions. Some want their
own country with solely their

own religion, and most people
don’t care. People need to stop
thinking of themselves and
think of future generations. We
must do this by looking into
history, so that it will not
repeat itself. These are signifi-
cant events in history. Events
from which we must learn and
grow. '

I cannot see how an educat-
ed individual could deny the
Holocaust occurred. It is a les-
son in history that will teach
future generations to not allow
this to happen again.Yet, in
Yugoslavia and other parts of
the world it seems the world
has not learned its lesson. The
sad conclusion is in a world
that’s getting smaller, educated
people still bring old hatreds
into play. It’s a problem that
must be addressed by all peo-
ple.

Hockey
secures

play-off
spot

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

There is no room for
mistakes anymore.

No sudden defensive
lapses, no bad penalties,
no brief letdowns during
the game. The time for
up—and-down play is
over. It’s time to get down
to business.

Without further analo-
gies, let it be said that the
Pitt Hockey Club did
what they had to do dur-
ing a grueling three-game
weekend series last
Friday through Sunday in
order to secure a spot in
the 1993~94 WPCHA
Championship Playoffs.

Going into last week-
end’s agonizing ﬂurry of
games first against
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, then
Slippery Rock University
and finally Carnegie
Mellon University, the
Panthers knew exactly
what needed to be
accomplished.

Standing at 3-4, in fifth
place in the league and
two points behind fourth-
place IUP and three
behind third-place Penn
State—West, the Panthers
needed to win at least
one game during the
weekend set to assure
themselves of a postsea-
son berth.

This meant that the
Panthers had to overcome
their recent sloppy play,
not to mention a consid-
erable fatigue factor, and
put a notch in the win
column against IUP at
Golden Mile, SRU at
Meadville or CMU at
Harmorville.

Friday night at Golden
Mile, the Panthers were
expecting nothing less
than a convincing win
against an IUP team
which they had beaten 7-
4 earlier in the year. Much
to the Panther’s chagrin,
however, the Indians had
rolled off an impressive
string of victories follow-
ing the loss to Pitt, and
they were not about to
see their postseason
hopes dashed so quickly.

The game was an
important one not only to
both teams involved, but
also to PSW, which had
several members in atten-
dance. A win by Pitt
would have knocked out
IUP and given the final

Womens hoops routes Hos,

By Ryan Buncher

Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s basketball
team (18—7, 12-5 in the Big East)
changed its starting lineup for
the first time all season in last
night’s game against
Georgetown (12-13, 6-11) at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The change was not to
replace junior point guard Carol
Morton, who injured her shoul-
der at Connecticut on Sunday. It
was getting Erin Maloy a start in
the final home game of her
career.

Seniors Maloy, jonna
Huemrich, Carolyn Miller and
Jill Colabrese finished in style as
the Panthers trounced the
Hoyas 78-64 and broke a three-
game losing streak.

“It’s the way you want to go
out,” Colabrese said.

The guard/forward was one
-of the keys early on, pulling out
of her recent scoring slump with
a 12-point first half.

“For her to have a good game
means a lot for us,” Huemrich
said. “We need everybody
shooting the ball well. She was
looking for her shot tonight,
more than she has in the past
couple games. She was hiding
offensively.”

“I lost my confidence for a
while. I needed a game like this
to get it back,” Colabrese said
after finishing with a game—high
19 points, including three three-
point shots.

Huemrich also came out fast,
scoring 12 points in the first half
and extending her streak of
double-digit scoring to 52
games. While the Hoyas held
Huemrich to five points in the
second half, she grabbed nine
rebounds (13 in the game) to

Former underdogs, women now look to win

By Brady Slater
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Before the season, the Pitt
women’s swimming and diving
team members would have
called themselves long shots to
win the Big East title.

But ask them now, and the
women will tell you that they
have a real shot at winning the
Big East championships, which
start today at Trees Pool.

“It’s hard to say that we
would be underdogs because
we’ve won in dual meets

against both Villanova and _

Miami,” junior Christy Knobloch
said. “So to say we’re underdogs
wouldn’t really be true.”

The story of this Big East meet
is parity. And the Panthers are
just one of the teams with a
legitimate shot to win the con-
ference title this weekend.

“I don’t know that there’s any
one decided favorite,” Pitt head
coach Marian Cassidy said.
“Obviously, Villanova is the
defending champion and
they're probably the strongest.

78-64

Jill Colabrese led Pitt with 19 points last night.

help Pitt outrebound
Georgetown 26-19 in the sec-
ond stanza.

The Lady Panthers scored the
first bucket of the game on a
jump shot by Huemrich and
never trailed, but the Hoyas
were only down 39-33 at the
break, in large part due to slop-
py play on both sides.

“Senior day can work against
you,” Bruce said. “You want to
do so well so badly, that you
forget about the things that help
you win. We told them in the
locker room to relax.”

However, they’ve lost a lot of
points to graduation and injury.
That’s going to make it a much
more exciting meet.”

The Pitt women have been
‘tapering for this meet for the
last few weeks, so they’re rested
and ready.

“Physically, everything has
been done,” senior captain Jen
Burns said. “We just have to
make sure that mentally we’re
ready.”

Being mentally prepared
is something that Cassidy,
an eight—time Big East champion
for Pitt, knows about and
is trying to instill in her swim-
mers.

“The trick is to stay relaxed,”
Cassidy said.

“Mentally, it gets very difficult
when you have all the other
teams coming in. The meet
atmosphere is here and it's
scary and exciting and makes
everybody nervous all at the
same time,” she said.

And for the Panthers to have a
chance, they'll need Burns to be

“We settled down in the sec-
ond half,” Huemrich said.

They also turned it up. The
Lady Panthers found the fast
break that keyed their success
early in the season.

“We ran like crazy,” Colabrese
said. “It was great. That’s what
we do when we win.”

W'hat Morton does when Pitt
runs is create turnovers and
push the ball up the ﬂoor. She
grabbed five steals and dished
out 11 assists in the game.

Tony Fiorini/Ihe Pitt News

Sunday Lewandowskfs diving is a key for Pitt this weekend.

 

To get a better understanding of saxophonist
John Zorn’s musical approach, it helps to know that
one of his earliest influences came from Carl
Stalling’s music in Warner Brothers cartoons. To
emphasize the cartoon’s visual elements, Stalling’s
music never stayed in one place for more than a
few seconds at a time.

“Cartoon music is a very strong influence in the
way I put together the disparate elements of my
pieces ...” Zorn said.

In the notes for T/ye Carl Slalling Project, which
released the cartoon music on its own, Zorn said,
“All genres of music are equal — no one is inher-
ently better than the other — and with Stalling, all
are embraced, chewed up and spit out in a format
closer to [William S.l Burroughs’ cut ups, or
Godard’s film editing of the ‘60s, than to anything
happening in the ‘40s.”

A similar assessment can be made about Zom’s

work. Elements of bebop, free jazz, improvisation,
Jewish folk music, classical and especially hardcore
turn up in Zom’s compositions and performances,
which he plays with an array of different bands.
Sometimes multiple elements appear in one piece.

Although Zorn makes his home in New York,
simply describing him as part of the downtown
New York music scene would be a disservice. His
prolific output and talent make him one of the fore-
most young composers in the country.

In light of that, Zom’s Pittsburgh appearance next
Wednesday carries with it the same significance as
would a visit by musical groundbreakers like
Ornette Coleman or Cecil Taylor.

Listing and describing all of Zorn’s recordings
would probably take up this entire article. Suffice it
to say he has crossed the boundaries between
“experimental music” and “punk rock” on more
than one occasion. More appropriately, he smashed

the boundaries.

Although the downtown New York scene only
recently began receiving national attention, Zorn
and other Knitting Factory regulars have been there
since the ‘70s. It was not uncommon to find people
with different musical backgrounds playing togeth-
er.

“Even  rock players like A110 lLindsay, now of
the synth group Ambitious Lovers] and Bill Laswell
[of jazz noise group Last Exit] were improvising with
that kind of downtown improvisingscene that ger-
minated in the 705,” he says. “As the ‘80s came in, I
think all the players began to formulate their own
musical ideas and go their own way.”

In the ‘80s, Zorn could be heardplaying an array
of saxophones, clarinets and  game calls.

That’s right, game calls, as in bird and duck calls
that hunters use. Zorn ‘would blow the calls into a

The Literary Companion To Sex
An Anthology of Prose and Poetry
Edited by Fiona Pitt—Kethley

419 pages

Random House

 

“For the last eighteen months I have read nothing but sex
literature in the cause of putting this book together,” Fiona
Pitt-Kethley writes to introduce her titillating tour de force,
7739 Literary Companion To Sex. And readers will be grateful
for her stamina; she successfully searched for the naughty,
“bad” but good parts in literature from antiquity to the twenti-
eth century.

She writes that selected passages had to meet her criteria:
realistic, humorous or the unusual. Most do.

All the usual suspects are gathered —— Aristophanes,
Sappho, Chaucer, Donne, Voltaire, de Sade, Nin and Miller.
But some unlikely voices appear, such as Benjamin Franklin’s
advice to a friend who seeks the company of older women. .

Rather than compile her encyclopedia by sexual experi-
ence, she writes, “I opted for arranging material according to
period, not by sexual activity. If I had done that, there
seemed to be a distinct possibility that the lazier reader
would select his/her favourite kink and only read a certain
section.”

I initially rebuffed her reasoning. I would never do that, but
then I realized I would have jumped straight to the homosex-
ual stuff. I am glad I had to comb all four hundred pages
seeking man—man, woman-woman sexuality. For on the way,
Ms. Pitt—Kethley uncovers lots of fun 

My favorite is a selection from C’/yin Ping Mei generally
attributed to the leading sixteenth century Chinese poet,

would be interesting to know if
this play was ever performed.
The scene directions are extra-
ordinary. One requires a foun-
tain of a woman standing on
her head ‘and pissing bolt
upright.’ Even more unusual is
the setting for Act V, scene ii: ‘A
grove of Cyprus trees and oth-
ers cut in the shapes of pricks,
several arbours, figures and
pleasant ornaments in a ban-
queting house; men are discov-
ered playing tabours and dulci—
mores with their pricks, and
women with jews harps in their
cunts.’”

Ms. Pitt—Kethley explains in
her introduction, “The last time

I read piles of erotica by choice,
I was fourteen.” The last time I
read erotica with such interest, I
had not even reached high
school.

Her Literary Companion To
Sex reminds me of when our
seventh grade English class
flocked to the library with
everyone trying to find as may
“dirty” passages in literature as
possible. Now, if the library car-
ries it, junior high students can
come to class armed with these
sex-sensitive Cliffs Notes. Here
are the parts our squeamish
English teachers ignored.

songs, remained faithful to the
squeaky melody which he
played on bird calls, but from
there it took off into turbulent
territory. It offended many jazz
purists, but Zorn had the com-
poser in mind when he
arranged it.

“I made lists of things that
Monk meant to me personally,”
Zorn says. “What he did for
music, his tradition, his sense of
timing, his humor, the disso-
nances that he dealt with, -the
primitive technique that he
tended to use to his advantage
 all those different things I
wanted to be incorporated in
my work.”

His reverence for the past and
desire to move forward played
a major role in two other works:

The Big Gzlndown, Zorn’s
homage to film composer Ennio
Morricone; and “Spillane,” a 25-
minute piece inspired by
Mickey Spillane novels.

Gundozun featured several of
Morricone’s pieces transplanted
into different musical settings,
keeping the music itself intact
but putting it in a different light.
“Spillane” evoked the plot of its
namesake’s novels, going from
a few bars of “Route 66” to
stripper music to the fight
music. The Lounge Lizards’
john Lurie appeared as the
voice of Mike Hammer, speak-
ing the part of the story’s detec-
tive.

Zorn received a lot of expo-
sure to more college radio lis-
teners when he formed Naked
City. Truly the band that could
play anything, the quintet came
the closest to placing all of
Zorn’s tendencies under one
roof. Their self-titled 1990
album featured covers of Henry
Mancini and Ornette Coleman
juxtaposed with original surf-
bebop-cum—thrash composi-

tions. The album was one of the
first places Americans heard the
Tazmanian devilish wails of
Yamatsuka Eye of Japan’s
Boredoms. He appeared on
seven thrash songs which
packed more complexity into
20 seconds (their average
length) than most bands can in
as many minutes.

Naked City took things to a
brutal extreme on Torture
Garden, their second album.
Released on Shimmy Disc
Records in 1991, it featured 42
thrash songs, ran at 45 rpm and
clocked in at 26 minutes.
Though now defunct, the
band’s legacy lives on through
several new Japanese CDs.

When Zorn takes the stage
Wednesday night, he will con-
duct 13 piece musicians
through his composition
“Cobra.” Designed in 1984, the
piece has no written parts.
Instead, Zorn gives various cues
to the musicians about how to
play. The notes to a 1986
recording describes “Cobra” as
“a system that allows the play-

ers to call up musical situations
— duets, personnel and dynam-
ic changes, group imitations of
a musician  through a set of
hand signals, then improvise
within the restrictions of the
context.”

But before Zorn performs,
The Ex and Tom Cora will set
things on fire. Described as a
Dutch anarcho-punk collective,
The Ex specialize in a brittle,
driving brand of music which
retains the rough feeling of
early punk bands.

Cellist Tom Cora collaborated
with the Ex on two albums and
performed with them in town
two years ago. He comes from a
similar background as Zorn,
playing in the New York
improv scene as well as with
the band Curlew.

By Sean Duncan
Stuff Writer

Losing is not something the
men’s swimming and diving
team has had to deal with much
in the last deca.de.

Pitt won 10 straight Big East
Championships, that was until
last year when’ Villanova
shocked the Panthers and
abruptly snatched away
their chance for an 11th straight
title.

The Panthers are looking to
regain their reign in the Big East
starting today through Sunday
in the Big East Championships
at Trees Pool.

“The end of February sticks
very heavy in the back of our
minds,” Captain Matt Brady
said. “We’re very ready to take it
back.

“The reason I have been
swimming for the past year has
been to win this meet again.”

To put it mildly, the team
likes its chances of recapturing
the title.

“I try not to be overconfident
and relaxed about it, but I defr-
nitely think we’re going to win,”
Captain Zack Economos said.

“We don’t want to sound
cocky because of what hap-

pened last year, but we do feel
fairly optimistic,” Brady added.
“We have a good feeling about
it. We’re going in with a very
aggressive, competitive atti-
tude.”

If competition is what the
Panthers are worried about,
head coach Chuck Knoles says
there’s a big gap.

“There’s an upper echelon
and lower echelon of teams.
Villanova, Syracuse, Pitt and
Miami are the upper echelon.
Providence, Seton Hall,
Georgetown and the rest are all
trying to get where we are.”

Against the “upper echelon”
teams, Pitt has fared very well.
They have doubled the scores
of all of them.

“That shows what we can do
when we put our minds to it,”
Brady said.

Pitt doesn’t even bother
swimming against the other
teams in the regular season.

“It would be like a Pitt-
Duquesne meet — it would be
so one-sided,” Captain Sean
Braud said.

“We killed Villanova, and
they won the Big East last year.”

So what do the Panthers have
to worry about?

The one thing that could beat

Tony Fiorini/The Pitt News

the conference tournament, which starts today.

the Panthers would be them-
selves.

“Depending on how focused
we are, if our focus is on regain-
ing back the conference title is
sharp, this could be as easy a
meet to win as the dual meets in
the regular season,” Knoles

said.

“I don’t think up to last year
anybody ever really thought
about how to win a champi-
onship, they just assumed that
we won it every year. ~

“We’re not going to be caught
unaware this year, that’s for

sure.”

Knoles has his team mentally
prepared this time around. He
has the team doing a lot of psy-
chological training and focus
drills.

prepared.

She is the top seed in the
200-yard freestyle, third in the
100-yard freestyle, fourth in the
500-yard freestyle, and 10th in
the 50-yard freestyle.

Each swimmer is only
allowed to swim three individ-—
ual events, so she’ll be
scratched from one of those.

“I saw that I was seeded first
in the 200, and it’s definitely a
place that I’m going to try and
hang on to,” Burns said.

Knobloch is another Pitt
swimmer who must have a
good meet. She is seeded sixth
in the 200-yard backstroke, sev-
enth in the 100—yard butterﬂy,
eighth in the 200-yard butterﬂy,
and ninth in the 100—yard back-
stroke.

“We need Christy to stand up

and race. She’s in some tight
events,” Cassidy said.

Other top Panther seeds
include senior captain Candie
Burke, who is seeded fifth in
the 400-yard individual medley,
as is sophomore Jenny Doran in
the 200 ﬂy.

Rookie Kara Crombie is seed-
ed seventh in the 200 back and
rookie Charla Caponi is ninth in
the 200 ﬂy.

Sophomore Alicia Tymes is
ninth in the 50 free.

The Panthers will need points
from these top-seeded swim-
mers, but the importance of
other swimmers should not be
diminished.

“In order for us to come out
on top, we really need every-
body all the way down the
line,” Cassidy said.

bly articulated Pitt’s strategy
best when she said, “EVeryone’s
going to have to stand up and
score points. If you were in the
consolations last year, you have
to make it to the finals this year.
If you didn’t make consolations,
make it this year.”

The prospects of that happen-
ing seem good for Pitt.

“Everyone’s been saying that
they feel strong,” Geubtner said,
“and we look a lot better.”

Unlike the rest of the sea-
son, the Big East is the only
meet that the Panthers really
rest for.

“We haven’t had a full shave
and taper yet this year,”
Knobloch said. ~

“I think Villanova had a full
taper and a full shave before, so
it’s going to be a tremendous
asset for us,” she said.

The swimming doesn’t start
until Friday, and it runs through
Sunday with the prelims at 10
a.m. and the consolations and
finals at 6:30 p.m.

But the diving starts today,
and for all intents and purposes,
the top points will belong to
either Pitt or Miami.

“Miami is bringing five nation-

al-caliber divers,” Pitt diving
coach Julian Krug said.

“There’s no reason not to
expect that our top two girls,
Sunday Lewandowski and Kara
Sixbury, won’t fight it out on an
equal basis with them,” Krug
said.

In December’s dual meet
between the two teams,
Lewandowski finished first on
the one-meter board and sec-
ond on the three-meter.

“Everybody’s doing better
now than they ever have,”
Lewandowski said. “Let’s hope
we get a good day going and hit
our dives.”

The Pitt divers have been
scoring top points all year for
the Panthers, and Cassidy says
they’ll really need those kind of
points for Pitt to win the Big
East.

In fact, Cassidy said that Pitt
will need a lot of things to hap-
pen right for them to win the
meet, but they have a shot.

“I’m going to tell them that
they have done the work and
they are where they need to
be,” Cassidy said.

“They just have to believe in
themselves.”

tremendous defense,”
Bruce said.

Pitt was consistently
able to find open players
behind the Georgetown
defense. The Hoya
offense struggled, in part
because of a defensive
switch by the Panthers.

Pitt split between man-
to-man and a 2-5 zone in
the first half, but turned to
a 1-2-2 zone early in the
second half.

“lIt was] something they
hadn’t seen in the entire
ball game,” Bruce said.
“They didn’t catch on and
took a lot of bad, quick
shots. It’s a good defense
for us when we are
ahead.”

The closest thing to a
Georgetown threat in the
second half was a 4-0 run
that made the score 45-39
with 16:07 remaining, but
Colabrese answered with
a three-pointer.
Georgetown reduced the
margin to single digits
only once in the final 15
minutes.

4 “Everything did click
today,” Colabrese said.
“Offensively and defen-
sively, we did the little
things we haven’t been
doing.”

Bruce said he felt the
emotions of the seniors’
final home game earlier in
the day.

“\X/hen the juniors
brought the cards up for
me to sign, writing some-
thing for each one got to
me,” Bruce said. “They
are pretty special people
to me. They have been
what you want as players
and people."

Colabrese said that
increased fan support this
year makes it even harder
to leave.

“Finally . the fans
have been great this year,
and I want to thank the
band,” Colabrese said.

“It’s sad. I love playing
here,” Huemrich said.

that we were relaxed the first
V day. We're going to come
strong out of the gates.”

Villanova might have
something to say about that.

“We match up pretty well
in the water against Pitt,”
Villanova head coach Chuck
Horton said, “but we don’t
have the diving to compete
with them.”

“They’re the reigning
champions,” Knoles said.
“You have to figure they’re
going to be the most threat-
ening.”

Pitt has the total package
whereas other teams don’t.
The combination of its deep
swimmers in every event and
its explosive divers makes
the Panthers the front-run-
ners to win the Champ-
ionship title again.

“Pittsburgh’s relays are
well-seeded,” Providence
head coach John O’Neil said.
“It seems like they have the
right mix of good, fast swim—
mers and divers.”

The next to unstoppable
diving team has a solid

nucleus of Braud, john
Soulakis, Jeremy McClean
and Steve Wolfe.

Pitt's swimming attack is
led by senior three-
event pool record-holder
Brady.

“We’re expecting great
swims from everyone across
the board,” Brady said. “I
have no doubt that this year
will be nothing less than a
team effort.

“We all have it in our
heads that we’re going to
swim we1l,” Economos
added.

For seniors like Braud,
Economos, Wolfe and Rob
Daum, this will be their last
hoorah.

“I won’t be listening to
someone else win my meet,”
Braud said.

“This is my meet. This is
my graduation present from
my teammates.

“I just see myself getting
the cup back. I feel Sunday
night wherever we are well
be celebrating with the
1994 Big East cup in our
hands.”

The only thing no one in
attendance had figured out was
a tie. In a sloppily—played game
by both teams, Pitt blew a two-
goal lead in the final minutes of
the game, and IUP kept their
postseason hopes alive with a 5-
5 deadlock.

Now, with the Panthers still
two points behind both PSW
and IUP, they would have to
wait at least one more day
before making any plans for this
weekend.

Finally, the Panthers put all
fears to rest and all uncertainties
aside with their first convincing

Rock which clinched a playoff
berth for the Pitt squad.

The game itself was called
with 6:38 remaining, when
Slippery Rock’s Jeff Witucki
took out his frustration with a
vicious cross-check to the back
of the head on Pitt’s Bill Elliott.
Elliott, the Panthers’ leading
scorer, is expected to be back in
time for the WPCHA playoffs
this weekend.

With the victory, Pitt knocked
out Penn State-West from the
postseason and wrapped up
third place in the league stand-
ings. Their game last Sunday
against CMU gave fans a pre-
view of the first round of the
playoffs in which Pitt and CMU
will face each other once again.
