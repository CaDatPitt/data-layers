  9 TV Speech
  3 Optimistic

The future of the University _

of P-ittsburgh was discussed in
length last Wednesday ev_e-
ning by the man who Wlll
have a lot to do with it, Chan-
‘cellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld.
In his ﬁrst appearance before
_a gathering of Pitt alumni, Litch-
H - ﬁeld gave an optimistic air when
=".***"”d‘E’cussing the future potentiali-
‘ ties of Pitt. '
. Speaking to Pitt’s Century Club,
. , at the Hotel Webster“ Hall, Chan-
» cellor Litchﬁeld said, “It is im-
fperative that the University must

adapt itself to change, to new con- _

cepts in education,”
He hinted of the coming change
, when. he stated, “I am not sure
. thatthe program of 30 weeks in
school and 22 out is the best. The
30-week program may well be an
educational anachronism that we
need examine.”

The chancellor added, “Pitt is
an organic part of the commu-
nity andthis, above everything
else, I pledge _to preserve.”

The greatest task before him, he
thought,‘ is to identify a distinctive
, /educational role for the Univer-.
","“~:e.=’”sity., “We must’ begin to put ﬂesh
, “ in this idea of a distinctive struc-
. tur,e,, by drawing students and
ﬁnances from all parts of the
, world, and by increasing emphasis
‘ L on quality of the University.”
I’ “It ‘ is high time,” the new
chancellor stated, “that this
« country had another great Uni-
versity to _. compete with those
which have so long dominated
our thinking.” I "
. The youthful administrator de-
. scribed money as a necessity to
growth; He feels that throughout
the country salaries are rapidly
increasing, while here at Pitt‘/they
’ have been relatively stable.
 "His closing remark was, “In any
' , event, I can promise you a thrill-
/ ing time in what can be one of the
greatest experiments in .higher
education in this’ century.”

By AL DONALSON

Men’s Council refused to appropriate funds for the Re-
ligion-in-Life Week during an MC meeting last Wednesday
afternoon in the Panther Room, since both MC and R-I-L are
subsidized by the University.
A Dean of Men Theodore Biddle said last week that the
University “gives Religion-in-Life funds just as they do for
other student activities, but the Religion-in-Life people al-
ways feel that they don’t have¢
enough funds and they ask other
organizations to, help them.”

Hotel. Council also approved So-
bel’s proposal that the Banquet
be stag. e '
A recommendation that Coun-
cil set up a service project was
referred to a special committee
that will be chaired by Arnie
Landy, Bus. Ad. ’58.

Landy said that there isn’t “any
place on the campus where a fel-
low can get his shoes shined, get
a button sewed, or get his trous-
ers pressed. I think it would be
nice if Council could investigate
_the situation and see what can be
done.” -

pp THE GRIM AND GRISLY ADVENTURES or
NORBERT SIGAFOOS, AMERICAN
If you squeam, read no further, for today’s column is not for
the squeamish.

‘It is a harrowing story which‘ begins in 1946 when N orberi: '4
S1gafoos,‘an_ichthyo1ogy major from UCLA, went on a ﬁeld trip

with his class to Monterey‘ Bay to study _the many ﬁsh and 1

crustaceans who make their homes in these waters.’

But truth to tell, Norbert was not very interested in ichthyol-
ogy. What he was interested in was television, which in 1946
was an exciting new infant industry. While his classmates
leanediover the rail of the boat, studying the tunny and amber-,
jack which swarmed below, Norbert just leaned and thought
about television. -Thus preoccupied, he fell overboard and, all
unnoticed, was washed far out to sea. A

A strong swimmer, Norbert, after 43 days, sighted land—a

tinyatoll, far away from"'.he normal sea lanes. Tired but happy, .

he clambered ashore. Being a college man, he was, of course,

fearless, resourceful, and clean in mind, body, and spirit. He _ -j 

built himself a snug shelter, fashioned traps for animals, wove
ﬁshing lines, and arranged day and night signals to attract-
any passing ships. -

    

 

   

".‘”"<7r('4m’ce/ 051/ a”rzo’ 71/51¢; gwzég ,/Mam’ J/1}’ [£51774 6 '

Though nine years went by, Norbert never abandoned hope
of being rescued. At long last, his patience was rewarded. On
October 14, 1955, he was picked’ up by the Portuguese ‘tanker,
Molly 0’Day. - V _ _ \

Ralph Gomez, the ship's captain, greeted Norbert with a
torrent of Portuguese. “Do you speak‘English ?” Norbert asked.

“A little,”isaid Ralph Gomez, which was no less than the
truth. He did speak a little English: two words. They were “a”
and “little.”

But, withal, he was a good hearted man, and he gave Norbert’
fresh clothes, a razor, and a cheroot. "

“No, thank you,” said Norbert to the cigar. “I’m a Philip
Morris man myself. Have you ever smoked Philip Morris?”

“A little,” saidARalph Gomez’. _

_ “Then you know what I mean when I talk about their yummy
I goodness, their delicately reared tobaccos, their soothing, con-
soling, uplifting, unfailing gentleness-pack after pack after
pack,” said Norbert.  ’

“A little,” said Ralph Gomez.

“I suppose’you’re wondering,” said Norbert, “how I kept my ‘I
sanity during all those years on the island.”

“A little,” said Ralph Gomez.

“Well, I'll tell you,” said Norbert. “I’ve been thinking about

television because that’s what I want to go into when I get back. ' -

For nine years I’ve been ‘sitting on that island thinking up‘,
brand new shows for television. And I’ve got some marvelous
new ideas! I’ve got one terriﬁc idea for a show where a panel
of experts tries to guess people's occupations. ‘What's My Line ‘.7’-
I call it. Then I've got one, a real jdoozy, where you pull some-
body unexpectedly out of the studio audience and do his whole

v life story. ‘This Is Your Life,’ I call it. But that’s notall! I
thought up areal gut-buster of an idea for a quiz show where
you give away not $64, not $6400, but—get this, Ralph Gomez—— ,
$64,000! Wow, I can hardly wait to get back to the States and
sell these fabulous ideas to the networks!"

There is, fortunately, a happy ending to this chilling tale. Nor-
bert never had to suffer the bitter disappointment of learning '
that all his ideas had long since been thought of by other people.
Why not? Because the Portuguese tanker, Molly 0’Day, struck
a reef the day after picking up Norbert and, I am gratiﬁed to
report, went down with all hands. ©Max Shulman, map

 A Judaism‘

~Ethical Study From Moses to Moses

By FLORENCE MERMEI_.STEl-N
Chairman. Panel of Americans

The story is often told of the sage Hillel who
‘answered the doubting Samaritan The Samaritan

bragged that he would become a convert to Judaism '

if 'Hillel could teach him the Torah, the Jewish
scroll of _laws, while standing on one foot. Hillel
quickly answered, “Do unto thy neighbor as you
__would ‘have your neighbor do unto you.”

In‘ writing this article, I cannot hope to make
 so “profound a statement, but rather explain only

 briefly the basic concept of Judaism.

‘-5,;

The word “concept” is used in the singular, be-
cause there is only one basic concept in Judaism.

_ This concept is the first of 613 commandments

given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai; it is also
the .ﬁrst principle of faith declared by Moses
Maimonides in his principles of faith. A

"Fence" As Protection .
Maimonides states, “I believe with perfect faith
that the " Creator, blessed by His name, is the Au-

thor and guide of everything that has been created,
and that he also has made, so makes, and will make

V ' and guide all things.” Around this concept, like a

fence, a whole body of laws, traditions, symbols,
and culture has grown up. This “fence” serves as
a protection for the main ideal.

The Torah,‘or the 613 ‘commandments given by
Gﬁi to Moses are all the Biblical laws that are
given to the Jewish people. The “fence” -that I
mentioned, which has been built up around these

‘laws, is the explanation and interpretation of them_

by the rabbis and scholars throughout the ages.

comments is called the Talmud. In the 13th Cen-
tury, Maimonides wrote a book called “Guide to
the Perplexed;” and Joseph Caro, ‘later compiled
the accepted code of Jewish law and tradition in
a book, titled “The Prepared Tables.” All rab-
binical students study these interpretations of the
law.

Because of the scope of this “fence,” Judaism is
more than a religion. Judaism is .a way'of life. It has
a history to learn from, a rich culture to inherit,
and customs and traditions to follow.

Even though there are different groups within
Judaism——the Orthodox, the Conservative, and the.
Reform—they differ only in theirinterpretation of
the “fence” of laws that has grown up around this
basic concept: the idea of belief in one God is essen-

tial.
/

The Jewish tradition is stressed among the
youth; until the time that a boy or girl born to
Jewish parents is thirteen years of age, it is the job
of, the parents to teach Jewish tradition. When the
.child« reaches 13, and has learned basic concepts
and" important tradition, he becomes responsible
for his own religious actions. In this manner, Juda-
ism is passed on from generation to generation.

Judaism is presently a dynamic force. Upon the
shoulders of the rabbis, -and teachers of the Jew-
ish people has fallen, the job of interpreting the
meaning of its laws. The fence of traditions has’
changed a great deal from the times that the Jews
lived in tribal groups in Palestine until today, be-
cause it adapts to the changing times. The moral
teaching has remained constant.

trines of the Roman Catholic
Religion are found in a prayer
called the Apostle’s Creed. It is

1 presented here with accompany-

ing explanation of the phrases.
I believe in God, the Father Al-
mighty, Creator of Heaven and
Earth.

Catholics believe that, in the
beginning, God alone lived. Then,
by His Almighty Power, He
created Heaven and earth and
all things in Heaven and on
earth. God created everything

out of nothing by an act of His

will. Catholics believe that the
Divine plan of the universe is

one that could not’ have hap-__

pened through chance.

Fall of Adam
And in Jesus Christ His only

_Son, our Lord who was con-

ceived by the Holy Ghost, born
of the Virgin Mary, suffered
under Pontius Pilate, was cruci-
ﬁed, died, and was buried.

Catholics believe God so loved
His creatures that He sent His
Son‘ to redeem them after the
fall of Adam. It was necessary

"that He who was Goodness and
Justice and Love Personiﬁed be

sent to atone. For, only the Son
of God, made man, could make
reparation for Adam’s disobedi-
ence, aninﬁnite oﬁense against
God’s law. ‘

He descended into Hell, the third
day He arose again from the
dead.

With His death, atonement
was completed and Christ re-
opened the gates of Heaven to
those in the depths of darkness

‘since’ Adam’s fall. Christ then

arose of His own power to prove
that He was truly God and not
a mere man.

,He ascended into Heaven, sit-

teth 'at the right hand of God
the Father "Almighty:

‘ Catholics further profess that.

Jesus Christ, the Son God made

man reigns, and is equal to God-

the Father. ~They believe this
because Christ, Himself, while

I

on earth, claimed by His words
and proved by His actions that
He is God and King. Christ fur-
ther claimed _that His kingdom
is not of this world.

To Judge Living and Dead
From thence He shall come to
judge the living and the dead.
_ This belief refers to the ﬁnal
judgment day when all who
have lived will be judged ac-
cording to their life and actions
and when our Lord will -pro-

nounce a sentence of eternal re- V

ward or of eternal punishment
on them.
I believe in the Holy Ghost.
The Holy Ghost is God and"
the Third Person of a union
called the Blessed Trinity. Th1S'
mystery of the Catholic religion
consists of God, the Father, who
created man; God the Son, who

' redeemed man; and God, the .
Holy Ghost, who increases the, 

life of grace in man.
The Holy Catholic Church

Catholics believe that Jesus, '

while on earth, established the
Catholic Church so that the /one
God could be worshipped by all
people in one manner and that

this worship Centers around thel

Mass, the renewal of Calvary in,
the world today. '

Three-"Fold Union

The Communion of Saints 1

This is the three-fold union
of the faithful on earth, called
the Church militant; the souls in
Purgatory, called the Church

triumphant; and those who have I

found perfect joy in Heaven,
known as the Church _triump-
ant. ‘
The forgiveness of sins

By Christ’s own commission

to his Apostles and their succes-
sors, the Priests of the Catholic
Church, Catholics justify

Orthodox Faith
Representative

» The Orthodox Church is made

“up of a number of independent
church organizations which are
united in faith, forms of worship,
spiritual ethics, and general pat-
tern ' of organization. Though
there is no .one administrative
center, all these churches consid-
erlthemselves to be branches of
the same. spiritual organism.

. The Orthodox claim to preserve
the Early Christian‘ faith as

"stated and interpreted by the

S e v e n Ecumenical Councils,

' which were held before the ﬁnal

break between tl e East and the
"West in 1054 because of the grow-
‘ing political and cultural es-

" irangement.

Scripture Main Authority

The Holy Scripture is the main
. authority, but it is to be inter-
preted in the light" of tradition,
the continuous stream of spirit-
ual,- devotional, and intellectual
life of the church. A great em-
phasis is placed on the writings
of the early fathers of the Church
who are regarded as authorita-
tive interpreters of the Faith.
There is no single authoritative
document which contains the
doctrinal system as it is true of
some religions.

The murgy of the Church has

great developments in religious
art and music during the Mid-
dle Ages have been incorporated
into the service, making it'aes-
thetically satisfying as well as
serving a community of believers.

Stresses Unity Despite
Differences

Because‘ of the disparity
among the various churches
within Orthodoxy, it is perhaps

a good example of the Value of.

stressing unity _and similarity
over differences. Within the Or-

thodox Church there are na-
tionality differences which have
made political and cultural uni-
ty very difficult, but through
the unifying element of a com-

lmon faith, these divergent groups

have ‘been drawn closer together.

In Religion-in-Life we hope
that welcan stress that unifying
element of Religion. We do not
wish to promote any one reli-
gious point of view, but rather,
while discussing vital issues,
note what- the major religions
have to say. It is heartening to
those of us who have been
troubled by the dissimilarities
in religion to find agreement on
really basic issues.

The Orthodox Church has,
achieved unity through the com-

pelling force of a common be-'

lief. In Religion-in-Life, we
hope to point out that a natural
sort of unity does exist "in high-

. er religion. It need only be rec-

When one attempts to deﬁne or explain Protes-
tantism, he ﬁnds a difficult task before him. Those
who are Protestants are really members of particu-
lar denominations. In spite of separate denomina-
tions, there are a number of similarities between
the Churches. ’ A

The Protestant traditions grow out of the Re-
formation in the Sixteenth Century. It is generally
dated when Martin Luther nailed his ninety-ﬁve
theses of religion to the church door in Witten-
burg in 1517. Luther’s was a’ protest against' the
authority of the Medieval Church in religious and
temporal matters. ‘ r '

He challenged certain religious practices of his
day emphasizing the need for -reform within the
Church. What originally began as a reform move-
ment resulted in a complete split from the Catholic
Church. '

Calvin. Zwingli Important . - '
Soon, other groups founded churches of their
own after the success of Martin Luther and his fol-
lowers. Such names as Calvin and Zwingli are im-
portant in this movement. The main Protestant
groups that were born during theeReformation were
the Lutherans, Calvinists, and Anabaptists. Under
Henry VIII in 1634, the Anglican Church became ‘

autonomous from Papal authority as the Church '

of England. .
Throughout the next two and a half centuries

_the numerous Churches of Protestantism separated

from thesemain groups. The chief Protestant de-
nominations today are the Presbyterians, Baptists,
Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalians, United Breth-
ren, Evangelical and Reformed, Disciples of Christ
(Christian Church), and the Congregationalists.
At the present time, Protestants are ﬁnding that
many of their primary beliefs are essentially. the
same. The ecumenical movement, ﬁnding expres-
sion in the World Council of Churches _and the Na-
tional Council of Churches of Christ in the United

     

   

of Spirit of Reformation 4

Churches for effective Christian action in human

society. ,,  J ‘

Four Gospels Reveal Teaching _, A 
Protestants believe that Jesus of Nazareth was 
the Christ, or the Son of God, as was revealed in _
his life and teachings. In the Bible, the four Gospels  
of ‘Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John contain. the _
stories of Jesus’ life and his teachings. Most Protes,-'  ',
tants believe that the Bible was written by men v
inspired by God. I  ’ 2 
Within its pages are found stories of the ways .  ' ‘

F God has been manifest in the world and in the

}x

lives of men and women. Protestants believe in the‘  
priesthood of believers, or that each person. may 
seek direct communion with God ‘through prayer .- ’ »
without reliance upon an intermediary. . :‘
Among Protestant denominations there are var-_ _
iations -in belief, interpretations of the Bible and the H ,~‘ ,,
sacraments, and Church government. The perform-  ’
ance of baptism varies from sprinkling to full i_m- V '/ * ;
mersion. Church government varies from the con; £1» 
gregational type of the -Baptist and Congregational ; 5_j,— A
Churches to the episcopal form headed by a bishop '
in the Episcopalian and Methodist Churches. Serv-A 
ices differ from the formal liturgical services of them‘ 
Lutheranand Episcopalian Churches to the inform"-,  ,_ :
al Quaker meeting. A l 

Differences Arise _ -, 
Within Protestant denominations there are dif-  U‘
ferences. These arise because of the different ways  
individuals interpret and express their creeds, be- ;
liefs, and the Bible. The fundamentalists believe in
a strict, literal interpretation of the Bible,and fol- ,
low orthodox relgious practices._ The conservatives ,
believe along traditional lines, but accept certain . 
recent innovations in their services of worship and I .; _ -2-;
religious practices. The liberals choose to interpret A

Hoopsters End-Year
With Century Score

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Racing to their highest point total in history, the Panther
cagers climaxed the 1955-56‘ hoop season by downing Penn
State at University Park Saturday night for a 100-90 triumph.

This win gave Coach Bob Timmons’ quintet a season’s '

record of 15-10. It brought Timmons’ career record in three

campaigns to 34-40.

, The previous high point total for a Blue and Gold team
was 97 against Geneva at the Memorial Field House during

the 1952-53 season.

Lazor Opens Lead

State had the lead only once in the free-scoring contest

at 2-0 on a push shot by Rud,y¢
. Marisa.,Bob Lazor then tossed in

two jump shots for a 4-2 Panther
’ advantage.

-Marisa pulled the opposition
even again at 4-4 on a hook shot
from ten feet out. The Jungle
Cats began hitting with uncanny
accuracy at this stage, and open-
ed an eight point lead, 29-21,
late in the ﬁrst-half.

Coach J o hn Egli’s quintet
knotted the count again with less
than two minutes remaining at 43-
43. Lazor and John Riser dropped
in six points in the ensuing time
.;for a 49-43 half—time spread.

Riser Takes Scoring Honors

After the intermission, the Blue
and Gold passers continued their
"hot scoring and raced to win on
the 31 point splurge of Riser, who

-., took individual honors. Lazor was

1 next with ‘23 markers-

With six minutes remaining in
the game, the Jungle Cats en-
joyed an 86-76 lead. Bobby
;Hoffman, State’s ace playmaker,
"became the first casualty via the
personal route. _
The locals went into a semi-
freeze and forced the enemies’

sliding zone to come out and at-

tempt to gain possession of the
ball. '

Consequently, the locals were
able to shake men free under the
hoop for- easy layups as they be-
gan ﬂirting with the century mark
with time running out.

Kleiman to Riser Scores 100 '
4 They realized the century mark
for the ﬁrst time ever "when Riser
took a court-long pass from Phil
Kleiman and drove in for the lay-
up just before the gun sounded.
The‘ locals displayed a good

scoring percentage as they hit
on 50 per cent of their shots_
from the ﬁeld. However, they
were outscored in goals from the
ﬂoor, 33-31 and had to depend
on foul shooting accuracy for the
win.

They topped 80 per cent in this
department as theymeshed 38 of
47 while the best that the Nittany
Lions could garner was 24. This
spread at the charity line pre-
served the victory and handed
State a losing season of 12-14. The
win was also the second of the
season for the Tirnmonsmen over
the Centre‘ county entry.

First Untlefeatetlisieason In Seven Years

Matmen Defeat Penn State, 16-1250

By ED KOLTISKA 9

Approximately 6500 roaring wrestling fans, largest crowd
in Penn State history, saw the Panthers edge out the Nit-
tany Lions 16-12 in one of the best meets of the year at
University Park last Saturday night.

' Individual Lion records dropped by the wayside as the
Panthers recorded their tenth straight victory. and seven-
teenth in a row for their ﬁrst undefeated season in seven

 

years. '

The turning point of the meet
came when Don Huff, normally a
177-pounder, dropped down to 167
to hand Ernie Young (2-0) his
ﬁrst defeat of the season by a score
of 3-0.The win put the Panthers
ahead by ‘one point 11-10 after
trailing 10-8.

Hulings Nodland Ties

‘In the 123-pound limit, Bill Hul-
ings (9-0) and Sid Nodland (7-0,)
of the Lions opened up "the tie col-
umn in their records as they wres-
tled to a 2-2 draw in the opening
match of the meet. -

Ed Peery, 130-pounder, put
the Panthers ahead 5-2 as he
continued on the undefeated
trail by handing John Johnston
‘('7-0) his ﬁrst defeat of the sea-
son 3-2 in one of the toughest
matches of the meet.

In the 137-pound class, the Lions
tied the score 5-5 with John Pepe
winning his eighth straight by de-
cisioning Vic DeFelic 8-4.

The Lions pulled ahead in the

In the 157-pound class, Dave
Johnson tried hard to pick up a
pin over Joe Humphries but had
to settle for a 4-0 decision when
Humphries played a stalling role

by staying away from the Pan-

The highlight of the evening
was the 177-pound match be-

tween Ed Dewitt (27-0) and Joe *

The Staters, rated second in the

The old adage, “a good big man will always beat the good
little man” was proven once again in the Inter-Fraternity A
Tournament quarter—ﬁnals, as the big men made the differ-
ence between a win and a loss for the competing,teams.
On Tuesday, Feb. 28, Phi Gamma Delta defeated Sigma
Pi 42-30 as Harold Underwood, Bill Welsh, and Al Zoller
came to life after the ﬁrst quarter and led their team to

victory.

The leading scorers in the game
were Underwood with, 14, Welsh
with 13 and Zoller with eight for
the winners. For the losers Fran
Alder and Charles Dahlinger had
10 points apiece.

On Wednesday, Feb. 29, the
tournament really got into full
swing with three quarterﬁnal
games being played. In the ﬁrst
game the Phi Delts whipped Delta
_Sigma Phi 56-36, as big Jim Tre-
bac came through with 26 points
for the evening.

Trebac’s turn around jump
shot was too much for the Delta
Sigs to handle, and that coupled
with the fact that the Phi Delts
controlled both boards through-
out the game spelled the differ-
ence. -

Al Hurbanek and John ./Eenich
