University Students Divided

 

Into Teams of Ten Men
‘To Raise Building Fund

CAPTAINS AAPPOINTED

 

The chapel services onlast Wednes-
day were given over to a discussion
concerning the raising of the $150,000
to build a student building. for Pitt.
The plan for getting the money, as
adopted ‘by the Student Senate, was
taken up and explained.

The general idea of the plan is to
break up the total sum into small units.
and, by taking care of each small unit,
the grand total will take care of itself.
It was decided to divide the University
up into \. the various schools, the
schools into their
classes int-o sections of 10, each “10
persons headed by a captain. The

-plan as it is'intended_ to work out

brings the problem down‘ to this:
There will be 150. groups of ten, or
1,500 people, each responsible for $100

of the amount to be raised.

Other Cities in His Investigation
of Economic Conditions.

 

Dean Holdsworth of the Economic
School of the University has just re-
turned from a trip to the
cities in connection with ‘his work in
the economic survey of Pittsburgh
conducted by him under the joint aus-
pices of the city and the Industrial
Development Commission.

On his two weeks’ visit Dr. Holds-
worth visited Buffalo, Rmochester, New
York, Newark, Philadelphia, Balti-
more and Washington. He was cor-
dially received in each city, a fact that
indicates the good will held out to-
ward Pitt-sburgh’s enterprise.

Speaking of his visit Dr. Holds-

Penn State Musical Clubs, which,‘ was ~ ' ‘T 1

held in Memorial Hall, Wednesday
evening, November 29, was, without a

doubt, one of the mo-st successful from.

every standpoint that the Pitt clubs
have ever engaged in, "either with
State or any other clubs. And, in_a
measure, so well did the members of
both the Glee ‘ and Mandolin Clubs
perform in their efforts to outdo State,
that half the sting of the defeat which

Dance at Schenley

After the concert an enjoyable dance"

was held at the Hotel Schenley. As
nearly all of the members of the com-
bined" clubs appeared, with their
friends, the ballroom, large as it is,
was slightly overtaxed, but this an-
noying incident was passed over as
not being worthy of mention. It is

estimated that there were nearly 150 ‘ 

couples in attendance. Music was fur-
nished by Nirella’s orchestra.

A large part of the success of both
the concert and dance must be at-
tributed to Manager Albert D. Frost
and Assistant Manager D. Allyn Gar-

played on any ﬁeld. I am more inter-

-ested in that game to-morrow than I

was in the Pitt-State game of 1904
and I was sure that I never could be
more interested. ina game than I was
in that one. It seems to me that words
are almost out of place on such an
occasion as this is, and I am not just
sure what I should dothis morning.
All passage from Shakespeare seems to
me most ﬁtting to the game.to-mor-
row:

;“My' words ﬂy up, my thoughts re-

main below;
to
heaven go.

“Last year before the State_game I
said that Richards was the best cap-
tain that Pitt had ever had, and I .now
say that “Tex” is the best captain that
Pitt will ever have. I want ‘Tex’ to
come u-pinow and say something to
the fellows gathered here this. morn-
ing.”. _' '

“I believe,” said “Tex” after "the
great cheering which greeted him
when he came on the platform had
sulbsided, “that Pitt is going to win
The team looks to be in
the best of shape. But if we should
lose let us show the true spirit of Pitt
and take the defeatlike men.”

 iAfter Richards had spoken, Joe said

he wanted to hear from Dallenbach.
Dallenbach _came up amid terriﬁc
cheering and said:
' “I saw State play Cornell this year
and I also saw.Pitt play Cornell this
season,‘ and in my estimation it is a
tossaup between the two teams. Pitt
has an excellent chance to win to-
morrow. I

“I want to say "a few words about
Joe Thompson. He is t'he best foot-
ball coach in the world—bar none. “I
know Joe and I am proud to say that
he is one of my friends. He is, as
the papers say,-‘Foxy ]oe.”’

After this speech Thompson made
another short address to the students.

“At to-morrow’s game,” said Joe,
“the rooters will have a large part to
play, for good rooting is’ a great help
to the follows on the ﬁeld. I lnve
often wondered what is college spirit?
I think, real college spirit is w“cu
every play that is being played on the
ﬁeld is being played over again in the
stands by every student; when a punt
is made, the students in the stands
punt; whenia man runs with the ball,
the stud.ents"in the stands run wit'h

the ball. This is what I call real col-
' lege szpirit. ~
“College spirit-—at least the best

kind——is not found by loitering around
saloons the night before a game,
smoking and drinking and telling
what your team is going to do on the
next day. I want every loyal student
of Pitt «to go to bed early to-night, to

i sleep if he can, and if he -is unable to

sleep, to think about the game tu-

Vmorrow. and about the‘ fellows who

are going to play to-morrow. And if
we win to-morrow, celebrate in a 9'4 1r
manner; if we do not win, take the
defeat like men. After all, the mam
who can, after having_lost a hard

1

game, shake the hand of his rival mv
say: ‘Well, old man, we are just .--.:.
good friends as before,’ is a better

man than the man that does a great —

deal of hurrahing, but has very little
depth of sportsmanship.

George Kirk now took charge of
the meeting. All the Pitt cheers were
run through, and also the songs, after‘
which the meeting was adjourned with

a big ALLE—GE-NEE.

DR. STRYKER ADDRESSES

UNIVERSITY. STUDENTS

 

President "of Hamilton College Brings
Greetings to'Pitt.

_In a short, and interesting talk in
chapel last Monday, Dr. Stryker,
president of Hamilton. College, New
York, brought greetings from the col-
legethat he represents to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. In addressing
his audience Dr. Stryker said. that,
seeing that the students before him
would in the course of time be the
great grandfathers and great grand-
mothers of the students attending the
University of Pittsburgh in the fu-
ture, and that consequently they would
then belooked up to as we now look
up to‘those of ﬁfty or seventy-ﬁve
years ago, therefore, he felt that he
was speaking to a very venerable
audience. After this jocial remark the
doctor spoke somewhat of his own
college. “I have not the honor to be
\pI'€Sl(l€.Ilt of a co—edu_cational school.
I realize that I miss a -great‘d'eal.”-

Dr. Stryker made his talk short on
account of the student meetings fol-
lowing, but in closing, he said:
“Through me as its representative,
Hamilton College has the honor to

-‘pay to the University of Pittsburgh

its compliments.”

FOOTBALL DOPE.
:Leahy was injurediearly in the
struggle and Blair took his place, only
to meet the same fate—a bruised
ankle. Gehlert, who took up the
burden at this point, performed cred—

itably.

Capt. L.indsay had hard luck with
his drop kicks, as the passes were poor
and_ the angle severe. Graves, who
took his place when his captain’s
ankle washurt, did very well.

Conne1ly\ made a couple of nice
runs after he was substituted for De-
war in the second quarter and stayed
in the game even though his ankle
was injured so that he could scarely
stand. He will be a dandy next year.

“Raz” Quailey was taken out in the
ﬁrst quarter and was delirious most
of Thursday night from his injuries.
Dillon took his position, but was hurt
in the fourth quarter, and Kernohan
played the remainder of the game.

When State had the ball on Pitt’s
3-yd. line, Miller, entrusted t‘he ball
to Mauthe’s care, but Red Smith broke
through and nailed him for a loss.
Miller carried the ball on the next
play, but Polly laid him low.

more kindly interest in one another.
They desire to know what Pittsburgh
and other large (cities were doing in
the way of material and social im-
provements. All were willing to show
what they had done. Pride in their
own progress in various lines did not
stand in the way of their freedom to
co—operate with others.

“All the cities I have visited have
something to teach us and in Pitts-
burgh we have something to offer
each and all of them in valuable sug-
gestions. On my tour I found many
frank enough to admit the speciﬁc in-
dustrial advantages possessed by
Pittsburgh alone.

“The kindly feeling toward Pitts-
burgh has been most encouraging. The
tendency to speak harshly of this
city and this city’s institutions no
longer exists. The reforms instituted
here in the last few years, the im-
provement and growth in our educa-
tional institutions and the progressive
spirit which has characterized our
business undertakings have been
heralded in practically every large
city.
cerning what particular lines we de-
sirefor our diversiﬁed manufactures
and concerning the facilities we have
to offer. This means that new con”-
cerns will »be attracted hither. This
is one of the ‘most encouraging signs
in the outlook of Pittsbur.gh’s future.”

And while there was no official deci-

unfortunate as to be unable to attend,
can pick the winner by asking “some-
body who was there.”

The hall, which began to ﬁll up
early in the evening, was tastefully
decorated with the pennants of the
two schools. The numbers receiving
the heartiest applause were the -vocal
solo of Mr. Cancelliere (which was
encored three times); “Annie Laurie,”
by the Penn State quartette, consist-
ing of Messrs. Miller, Stoddard, Gray
and Kaiser; Mr. Cratty’s mandolin
solo, “Concerto in D,” and “A Tale of

Woe,” sung by Mr. Kirk with the as— ,

sistance of the Pitt Glee Club. The
latter was heartrending from a sor-
rowful point of view and at its conclu-
sion Mr. Kirk was so overcome from
its recital that he had to be borne out
of the hall on a stretcher by four of

CLASS OF 1912.

the 1912 Class Memorial.‘ This state-
menrt shows a large part of the money‘
pledged to be outstanding. Accord-
ing to the desire of the class when.

Alma Mater at that time, it will be:

The -committee in charge of this
fund‘ desires to start the work upon

that all the subscriptions be paid.
Every member of the Senior class‘
should pay his subscription before the
beginning of the next term. Unless

morial wi1l'be so delayed that it can-
not possibly _ be ﬁnished by the last
week of school. If the Seniors desire
to complete this fund, the subscrip-
tions must be paid within the next
few Weeks. ‘ E

VANDALISM.

Certain actions have taken place
during the last two~weeks which call
for drastic, action on the part of the
Student Senate. In certa.in class
rooms chairs have been rendered unﬁt
for use through the rowdiness of cer-
tain unknown persons. Since this
University is under student govern-
ment, these offenses can be punished
only thrgugh action by the student
body. The case in question concerns
but few of our students. We feel cer-

tain that the great body ‘of our stu-

dents are“ utterly opposed tosuch
destructive rowdiness in any shape
or form. No gentleman will be a
party to any conduct which will cause
the destruction of any property- Cer-
tainly the students should not be
forced to suffer for the ungentlemanly
actions of a few unworthy members
of the university.

But the only way by which the
blame can be placed upon the guilty
persons is through an investigation
by the Student Senate. If the of-
fenders cannot be found, at least steps
can be taken to prevent a recurrence
of the offense. Located as vyeare in
new buildings, with new equipment,
it should be the duty and the pride
of every student in the University to
keep everything in the best of condi-
tion. If certain members of our stu-
dent body are. so devoid of all ‘sense
of propriety as to devote their en-
ergies to the destruction of our prop-
erty, some action should be taken by
the Student Senate which will force
such persons to respect the rights of
others.

GOOD‘ SPIRIT.

The last football season has been
marked by the most loyal spirit shown
by any body of students in the his-
tory of the University for many years.
The mostvremarkable feature of the
rooting at the football games this
year has been that the students were
more loyal in the face of defeat than
when victorious. With defeat staring
them in the face in both the Carlisle
and State games, the students re-
doubled their efforts. In the Cornell
game the greatestexhibition of school
loyaletyvwe have ever "seen was given
by the few men who took the long
trip to that school. C
_ It is such spirit as this which makes
us proud that we are Pitt men. Vic-
tory is not the most important result
of the football season. The spirit of
loyalty which ﬁlled the students of
this University is something greater
than the greatest team in the country.
Our team was a great team. It bat-
tled in hard luck throughout the whole
season. But never in its worts defeats
were there any knocks heard from the
students. _ _

On the other hand the more bad
luck we had, the more loyal the stu-
dents became. The ﬁghting spirit

which characterized our coaches_
players and students is something of
which all Pitt men may well be proud.
It is such loyalty as this which makes
a school great.

THE STUDENT BUILVDING.

The Senate has ﬁnally adopted a
plan by wh'ch the money for the
much-desired student building can be
raised. The whole student body, is
divided according to schools. and
classes into teams of ten men, each
of which teams is responsible for one
thousand dollars.. Now that the or-
ganization of the students has been

oompleted, it is necessary that every.

man devote his utmost energy toward
raising the sum assigned to him. This
money can be secured only through
the most energetic work on the part
of the students and faculty.

Thestudents have now the oppor-,

tunity to Show ‘what they can do for
their school. To be successful in the
task before us, not a single man can
shirk. The success of the whole de-
pends upon the success of each indi>
vidual. This building when secured
will enable our Christian Associations,

_our student clubs, our publications to

start work with renewed life. Handi-
capped as they are at the.present time
by lack of room, it is impossible for
them to serve the purpose for which
they were organized until adequate
facilities for carrying‘ on their work
are secured. A These facilities will be
secured when the new building is
ﬁnished. So let every man as he loves
his school to use every possible
means toward making this campaign
successful. We heartily believe that
two thousand students cannot fail to
impress upon the people of Pittsburgh
and vicinity the necessity of this cam-
paign. We are members of a great
and growing University, one which is
bringing honor upon the city whose
name it bears. Let each man do his
share in this great campaign.

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir:—I wish to call attention
to the handicaps under which the Y.

ing. Wit'h no room in which to
gather, owing to the action of the
faculty in‘ taking the room formerly
used, with‘ no ﬁxed meeting‘ hour
owing, to the heavy schedule,_it is
almost impossible for this body to
perform the duties demanded of it. If

the school_desires to maintain such,

an organization, it will be necessary
for it to take some action in the near
future which will provide forfit. It
must have a 'meeting time and place.
No organization conducted on the
principles of the Y. M. C. A. can suc-
cessfully exist without some room in
which its ’members can meet each
other. I hope« that we will not be

forced to wait until the student build- ‘

Rooters’ Night at the Theater.

To the Editor of the Pitt Weekly:
The so-called cheering contest‘ or

,“rooters’ night,” as arranged by a local

theater, should not be countenanced

by the University of Pittsburgh in the or
‘future. ‘The purpose is one of pure .

commercialism, and not one ‘of Uni-
versity loyalty.

The acme of absurdity is revealed
when an institution nfuour calibre con-
descends to hoot and scream with a
howling mob of schoolboys. As an
advertising scheme the plan is excel-
lent-—for the theater; but, as an uplift
to old Uni., a miserable failure.

It is hoped our athletic authorities
will grasp the incongruity of the sit-
uation and abandon the vocal “train-
ing”. of the students when the curri-
culum is announced next fall.

Very respectfully, .
SENIOR.

SENATE OUTLINES CAMPAIGN.

 

(Continued from Page 1) ‘

It has -been decided to make out the
subscription cards to be issued in the
campaign for $10; but these cards may
be scratched and any amount substi-
tuted by_the subscriber. Each person
may give just what he thinks he is
able to give. The cards were made
out for $10 -because many people will
be unable to give more than that
amount, while those who can‘ give
more won’ticount the $10 given for
the students’ building.

Every man who goes in the cam-
paign will be furnished with sub-

tion card, in order that every person
he approaches for a subscription will
be sure he is authorized to do so.

Chancellor McCormick made a
short, speech in which he gave out
some very good advice to those en-
tering on this work. He said in part:

“There are, you know, in this world
two classes of individuals: one always
hopeful, cheerful and pleasant; the
other discouraged, gloomy, pessimis-
tic; and in such work we have no
time for the pessimist. I know busi-
ness is not what it ought to be in
Pittsburgh; I know in many respects
our anniversary celebration is coming
at a very poor time; but I have little
time to think of such matters —- the
celebration must go through and we
must have our increased endowment.
I tell you the world is not looking for
the man that says: ‘It can’t be done’
It can’t be done!’ I The world want:
things done, and has no time for the
man -that wants to explain why things
can’t be done.”

Dr. Holdsworth said that the Even-
ing School was hard at work on the
$150,000 problem and threatened to
raise the whole sum themselves.
talk on optimism and loyalty. He
said'in the course of his -speech:

“If any student is too heavily laden
with wiirk, let him hunt, up that man
George, and he will help him and will
gladly give his last nickel for the
cause of the students and the Uni-
versity.” A

Dr. Chalmers spoke a few words of
warning against an irmpassive attitude
“in going after people for this money
for the student building.

“Don’t,” said he, -“say, when asking
for money, that the University wants
to build a student building, will you
give $10? But say that the students
-have undertaken the task, and that
you, as a student, are very anxious to
see the sum raised.”

In» conclusion, Dr; Chamber-s said:
“Dr. Holdsworth has said what the

but as yet I haven’t»saidi a word to the
body of ‘school-ma’ams’ who come
here on Saturdays; but I know if I

After the stu-dent building plans had
been discussed a rooters meeting was
held, details of which are "given in
another column of the paper.

For Richards

When the Class’ of 1910 learned that
ex-Capt. “Tex” Richards was in town

 

- to assist in boosting up the ’Varsity

for the State game they immediately

‘got _their heads together and decided

to show him a good time for at least
one evening anyhow. “Tex” was very
popular in his class, being elected
President in both his junior and senior

year, besides holding several other of-

ﬁces. He is employed at present in
Butler, Pa., but obtained a week’s
leave of absence to help Coach Joe
Thompson improve the weak places
in the Pitt lineup for the State game.

The dinner was given last Tuesday
night at the Fort Pitt and following
this the 10 boys went to the Grand
for the remainder of the evening and,

' from all reports, hada splendid even-

ing. The faces seen were t'he same as
were seen several years at all school
and class activities. Among those
present, were “Waldy” Zieg, Karl E.
Davis, Harry Reizenstein, “Tex”
Richards, “Jack” O’Connor, W. E.
Millar, “Long John" Campbell and
others.

end of sixty minutes of gruelling bat-
tle stood 3-0 in favor of the Centre
County aggregation, but this hardly
represents the comparative, strengths
of the rival elevens. Pitt ‘played their
husky rivals to a standstill in every
department of the game and when
State saw that they were powerless in
the last half of the game, they were
glad to hold Pitt even and play for
time as much as possible. The game
was a surprise in several ways; in the
first place, Pitt had not feared State
from a goal kicking standpoint and
this is the play that spelled defeat»; in‘

-t'he second place, Pitt had depended

on the ability of several of her play-
ers to outpunt State, but this went

wrong and practically won the game

for the opponents as they were able
to block Pitt’s kicks which kept the
Gold and Blue from scoring several
times. ‘ '
Pitt. got a bad start as she has in
all her big games this year, Galvin’s
kickoff was a failure—-the ﬁrst time in
his history. Dewar [fumbled a punt,
State recovered the ball a-nd a few
minutes later Mauthe kicked the ﬁeld
goal that ended the game as far as
scoring was concerned. In the second
quarter, Brown and Dewar carried the
ball to State’s 15-yard line and C-apt.
Lindsay tried a ﬁeld goal which failed.
A forward pass, Dewar to Lindsay.
put the ball.o_n State’s 8-yard line and
again Lindsay tried to boot it over

the bar, but again was doomed to fail-—

ure. Again Brown and. Dewar took
the ball within striking distance, but
the latter was badly injured and again
the Pitt stands were disappointed
when Galvin missed a placement kick.
The greatest play of all was pulled
off by Wagner in the third quarter:
State had the ball on Pitt’s 30-yard
line, the result of a kick rolling out of
bounds, when Miller essayed a for-
ward pass. Hube was waiting for
th'at~very*"play it seems, and gobbled
upthe ‘ball, the next instant he-_-was

sprinting. toward the State goal-i-right-

along the side lines and Miller, the
State quaften ‘ was running ,a. little
ahead\of‘*the‘Pitt 'player*'an‘d off to

He edged slowly toward
Wagner and at the State 30-yard line
threw himself into the Pitt runner
and pushed him over the sideline. In
the meantime, Mauthe, who had been
relegated to the bench on account of
an injury, ran to the sidelines to in-
tercept Wagner, w'ho, he thought, was
sure to score. Just as Miller pushed
Wagner over_ the line the State
coaches hustled Mr. Mauthe back to
his comfortable and safe place on the
bench. It was merely a question of
a few inches and Pitt would have—
well, what's «the use anyway?

The Pitt defense played a remark-
able gamc, holding State for downs
on the three—yard line and again on
the one-foot line and showed wonder-
ful recuperative and staying power.
That State was surprised. by this
stonewall defense is putting it lightly.
They threw their men into the line
only to be repulsed, they shot their
backs in sweeping plays around the
ends, but met with little success; they
tried forward passes, double passes
an‘! tricks,‘ all to no avail, the Pitt
defense showing an invulnerable
front at critical times and State’s for-
mer irresistible oﬁfense was brought
up standing. ,

Not for an instant .did the great
team representing Pittsburgh slow up,
they plugged and plugged and plugged
and fought off the State players till
the ﬁnal wh.istle sounded. In the last‘
quarter when Pitt had possession of
the ball, the plays were called quickly,
the ball snapped fast and the team
lined up in an instant, so anxious
were the players to score. No one
could accuse the State men of this;
they did their best to. keep things
goingias slowly as possible for they
knewithat they were powerless to
score and wanted to give Pitt as little
chance as possible——but such is the
game and it shows that the quarter-
back used hisinoodle.

The Pitt men showed splendid spirit
--not once did they give up; it was
ﬁght, ﬁght, ﬁght all the way, not only
in a plunging sullen way, butiin a
dashing, reckless, charging style that
would have carried many ‘of the best
football teams of this country com-
pletely off their feet; Spirit emanated
from the Pitt cheering section, the
rooting was just as sharp, the ﬂags
waved ‘just as high and the spirit was

just as great after the whistle had

Banquet After
State Game
, Big Success

The P. A. clubhouse was the scene
of an elaborate banquet on Thanks-
giving night after the annual football
game with Penn State; A. R. Hamil-
ton, ’94, was the host and this
staunch alumnus of Old Pitt did not
spare any trouble to make the banquet
the ﬁnest ever given to the ’Varsity.
The Kettering Orchestra, led by the
famous “Ben” Kettering of Greens-
burg, furnished the music for the even-
ing and the lively selections played
made abig hit with all present.

The menu was arranged by Man-
ager Duffy of P. A. A. and the playe_rs
in particular did full justice to the
splendid repast. The banquet started
about six o’clock and did not end until
theater time. \

Among those

“lPolly" Galvin Will
Lead 1912 Team

At the football banquet given the
players on Thanksgiving night Ralph
M. Galvin was unanimously elected
captain for 1912. His election to this
responsible position was a popular one
as “Polly” has‘, achieved great things
for the Gold and Blue. on the gridiron
during the past three. years and a
splendid season is looked for next
year under this player’s leadership.

“Tillie” Dewar received a dislocated
knee in the State game and was hur-
ried to the Mercy Hospital from the
ﬁeld but refused absolutely to stay
there as he wanted to cast his vote for
“Polly” at the banquet._ Finally after
a great deal of trouble ’the doctor
agreed to let “'I‘illie" go but only after
the latter hadpromised to return im-
mediately to the hospital. The in-
jured leg was put in a splint, crutches
were gotten and .a taxi whirled the
triumphant “Tillie”’ to" the banquet,
where he saw that hisigiant churn re-

blown and the rooters realized the de-
feat as it had been before the game. 1
“Hube” Wagner, Pitt’s great end
was the hero of the game, he seemed‘
to be all over the ﬁeld at once, break-
ing up interference, tackling vicious-
ly, hurling the forward pass and car-
rying the ball. His opponent, Capt.
Very, is said toybe one of the best
players in college circles, but Wagner
played tag with him all through the
game and made him look like a dub
——there was absolutely no comparison
in the playing of these two men.
Brown put up a sterling article of
football, both on the defense and of-
fense. “Tillie” Dewar played a star
game, but was badly injured in the
second quarterand was taken to the
hospital, where it was found he had a
dislocated knee and ﬁnger, besides
some painful bruises. Soles did well
and will be a valuableeman next year.

. Every player that took part in the

game against State deserves much
credit for his ’nerve, aggressiveness
and staying powers, -and even in de-
feat every true Pitt man is proud of
his team! ’

‘Detailed Account of the Game.

Very won the .toss and chose to
defend the west goal. ..

Galvin’ kicked off, sending the ball
out of bounds at the 25-yard line, and
the play was called back. This time
he booted to Miller on the 15-yard
line. Miiller got back on good inter-
and after he had traveled

Mauthe fell back for a kick, but in-
stead he faked it and ran ﬁve yards,
following this with a 12-yard gain on
a forward pass to Miller. King, on

_ a play along the side lines, gained

three yards and -Lindsay set down
Mauthe. _ ’ ii .

Mauthe turned loose a quick on-
side kick to Dewar, “Tillie” dropping
the ‘punt and Very regaining it for
Stateon Pitt’s 35-yard line. Mauthe
and King failed to make a ﬁrst down.
Soles ‘getting King, who ‘had gained
four yards on a quick shift formation.
Pitt, however, was penalized ﬁve
yards for off-side play and the bal-1
was on the 24-yard line. ' .

Mauthe gained, three yards on a
play off tackle and Very gained but
one yard on a double pass. Standing
on the 33-yard line Mauthe tried a

e d goal from placement and missed.
9. Pitt -put the ball in play on her 25-
yard line and ,Wagner kicked to
Miller on the State 50- rd line,
Miller coming back but four yards.
The ball, however, was taken back and

' State was penalized ﬁve yards for off-

side play. Wagner gained two yards
through Engle, and when. Wagner es-
sayed t-o punt Harlow blocked it, but
Smith fell upon the‘ball for Pitt on
the 32-yard line.

, Wagner kicked to’ Miller on t'he
Pitt 50-yard line. King circled the

‘end for 5 yards and Barry got 2 yards

at center., Mauthe making a ﬁrst
do-w-n., -Mi,l,ler.threw,.,to Very and the
ball was on the Pitt 25-yard line.’

Miller swept around the Pitt right
Hank and Dewar and Soles both tac-
kled him on the four-yard line. A
touchdown» seemed certain. Smrith
broke through and stopped Mauthe
for.no gain. King made one yard at
center, and when he tried again he
failed, and it was Pitt’s ‘ball on the
one-yard line.
