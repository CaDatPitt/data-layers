Former British
‘Prime Minister
addresses Pitt  
at fundraiser

By Jennifer Calabrese

and Megan Bertino
The Pitt News ’

Former Prime Minister of Great Britain
Margaret Thatcher said her degree from
Oxford University in chemistry set her on
a course which led her to places she never
imagined.

“Chemists go to the most unexpected
places,” she said.

Thatcher spoke at the Vista International
Hotel last night at a fund—raising dinner
sponsored by Pitt Ambassadors.

“It’s always a great joy for me to return
to university,” she said. “We all owe a
great deal to university.”

Thatcher stressed that college students
should seek vocational as well as
intellectual training while in college. She
particularly supported the sciences, calling
for universities world wide to do more
research.

Thatcher commended Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor for the work done_at
Pitt.

“It is a great joy to me to see so much
research at this university,” she said.

Thatcher said one of the most important
aspects of research is the liberty for a free
flow of ideas. She noted that liberated
societies are always ahead in research and
. should continue to work to maintain that
edge.

Historically, she pointed to science under
Adolf Hitler and the ramifications if
Germany had been the ﬁrst country to
have the nuclear bomb.

On the breakup of the Soviet Union
Thatcher said she saw an opportunity for
change with new leadership years before

Oakland fire decision expected today

By John Temple"
Sta_ﬂ‘W1-iter

The decision to cut or keep
lower Oakland’s only water-
carrying ﬁretruck will be decided
in a private hearing today between
the fireﬁghters’ union and the
city, according to the captain of
Firehouse 14, Bryan Devine.

If Firehouse 14, on the corner
of McKee Place and Louisa Street,
loses its pumper truck, then a
firehouse on Allequippa Street
would have to respond to lower
Oakland’s calls, taking a few
minutes longer, Devine said.

“We usually have one to two
big fires a year [in lower
Oaklandl,” Devine said, “but
they’re usually pretty good ones.”

But many of the smaller, easily
put out ﬁres could turn into big
blazes if left unattended for a few
extra minutes, Devine said.

“Instead of being a one—alarm

fire that we catch in one room,
now we are’ going to lose the
whole building,” he said. “If they
get another minute _to go, we’ll
get a big ﬁre and maybe injuries
or fatalities.”

Mayor Sophie Masloff’s
proposed budget includes a ﬁre-
department reorganization that

would retain the ladder truck at ‘

Firehouse 14 but eliminate the
pumper truck. According to
Devine, that would render the
firehouse nearly useless in a ﬁre
because the fireﬁghters could not
pump water.

“Number 10 was going to close
up, but the people up there
bitched  so instead of closing it
up, they left that one there and
decided to take our pumper. Now
they can say, ‘We,didn’t close any
firehouses.’ In reality 'they’ve
reduced fire protection in lower
Oakland immensely,” Devine
said. ‘

Neither City Fire Chief Charles
Dickinson nor City Council
member Dan Onorato, who chairs
the council's public—safety
committee, were available for
comment Friday or Monday.

The‘ fireﬁghters’ union and the
city have discussed the safety of
the reorganizing plan in several
binding arbitration hearings over
the last few months.

Devine said the ﬁreﬁghters as
well as the public would be put
in danger by the plan, which
eliminates the pumper truck from
South Oakland. Studies have
shown that fewer numbers of
firefighters per team lowers the
team's efﬁciency and safety, he
said.

“That makes [the decision] really
precedent—setting,” Devine said.

“They can arbitrate our hours or .

wages, but’ telling the city how
many units they have to have has
never been done before”.

Lawscbool deem resigns

By Michael King
Smﬂ Writer

After eight years of presiding over Pitt’s School of Law, Dean
Mark Nordenberg will resign next year and resume his position
on the faculty.

Nordenberg came to Pitt 16 years ago and spent the first eight
years as a member of the law school's faculty. He was appointed
interim dean in 1985 and was instituted as dean in 1987.

Nordenberg told TbePitt$bu7gb Press he was looking forward
to having more time to devote himself to current issues which
interest him.

O “I am very active both nationally and within the state in
dealing with issues of court reform, and I would like to be able
to devote more time to that,” he said. ,

Nordenberg told The University Times the Summer 1993
resignation date will be a “good time for a change” because it
will mark his 16th year at Pitt. Half the time was spent on the
faculty, and half the time was spent as the dean.

He was quoted in The University Times as saying, “I would say
that the school of law is immeasurably stronger today than it was
in the fall of 1985. Certainly I don’t claim all of the credit, but
I am proud of the progress that has been made.” .

Nordenberg has given Pitt a full year to conduct a nationwide
search to find a new dean for the law school.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April 7, 1992

 

Rare is the person who does
not experience criticism ,ab,out
his or her behavior. Rarer~still is

the person who handles it well. '

Most of us respond to criticism
with defensiveness.

Sometimes this defensiveness
takes the form of anger and
counter-attack, and at other
times it may show its face in
denial or in justification of our
behavior. ’

Other people have an opposite
kind of response and take
criticism as proof of their
inadequacy.

These people often have
serious self-esteem problems and
in the face of criticism may
withdraw and ruminate over the
offending comments.

Neither approach ‘is very
functional.

Certainly excessive criticism can
be damaging, but a moderate
amount of criticism can be useful
to us.

It provides an opportunity for
us to learn something about

slllllzllllll

   

 

Gallagher

ourselves, especially when the
criticism is constructive and we
believe it is well-meant.

It is, of course, nice to have
people around who never criticize
us and who always reflect back
our more desirable qualities. We
learn more about ourselves,
however, from people who give
us their honest perception of

  

behavior.

Even if these perceptions are
hurtful, and perhaps even
distorted, we need to hear and
explore them. If, for example,
someone tells us that we are
racist, sexist, homophobic or that
we are insensitive, inconsiderate,
overbearing, boring or narcissistic,
denial may spring quickly to our
lips.

This is an understandable
reaction but probably not the
most constructive tactic we can
take.

It‘ is not necessary for us to
accept such negative evaluations
as fact, but we are well advised to

enter into some reasonable 9

conversation about the criticism
before we attempt to change the
other person’s view. This dialogue
can happen if we make such
responses as, “That's not easy to
hear, but tell me more about it,”
“What is it about my behavior that
makes you think this way?” and
“IS this just your view, or do you
think others might also see me

Defensiveness at part of responding to criticism

this way?”.

If there is an element of truth to
the negative judgement — and
there often is -— state some
recognition of that truth but also
encourage a fuller elaboration of
the criticism. Even if we disagree
with the criticism, we can thank
the person for his or her honesty.
We can also say that we see
ourselves differently and explain
why. '

The most important thing is_

that we handle it in a way that
does not close the door to further
honest criticism.

Listening to criticism is not
easy to do.

It often goes against a strong
instinct to defend ourselves
against any challenges to our self
perceptions.

However if we can make even
a little "progress in opening
ourselves to hearing criticism, it
will increase our chances of
having more open and honest
relationships with the significant
people in our life.

Heinz memorial held

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Pa. Sen. John Heinz, killed in a
helicopter crash one year ago,
was remembered at a memorial
service yesterday honoring his
philosophy and life work.

Rev. Fred Rogers, a friend of
the Heinz family and the creator
of the children’s television show
Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,
spoke about Heinz after a mass in
his honor at Heinz Chapel.

Rogers related a story about
Heinz’s grandfather, who “used
clear, glass jars to allow his
customers to see what they were
getting.” He compared this image
to the way Heinz himself
conducted his work in the Senate.

The mass, officiated by Bishop
Donald. W. Wuerl, was attended
by about 100 people, including
Sen. Harris Wofford, who was
appointed and later elected to
Heinz’s seat. Former PittPresident
Wesley Posvar and Pitt Chancellor
J. Dennis O’Connor were also
present.

Wuerl said there are two signs
of a kind of life after death for
Heinz.

“One: his children,” Wuerl said.
“lt’s impossible to look at his
children and not see
characteristics that tell us  his
life does continue. And then there
is his memory, locked in the
hearts and minds and the stories
and the lives of all of us.”

Rogers said that one of the last
pieces of legislation Heinz was
working on would have
prevented the Pentagon from
stationing husbands and wives in
a war zone at the same time if
they had children.

“[The legislation showed]
simple, compassionate thinking
on Jack’s part,” he said, “but it
was almost unanimously

.defeated. What does that say

about the rest of the Senate's
understanding of human.
compassion?

“Like Jesus of Nazareth, John
Heinz of Pittsburgh stuck his neck
out for the little people,” Rogers
said.

Senate VP dies after fall

University Senate Council Vice President Oxanna Kaufman
Rentler died Friday morning as a result of fall she suffered in her
home Wednesday evening.

Rentler, who worked in‘ Hillman Library’s preservation
department, was an active member of the University Senate
Council for over 34 years.

Before she began her tenure as senate vice president, Rentler
served as University Senate Council secretary and was a
member of the Senate Committee on Athletics and the Senate
Budget Polices Committee.

“She has always been active in university affairs,” Faculty
Assembly President Richard Tobias said.

Rentler was also director of the library on the SS. Universe,
Pitt’s Semester at Sea ship. _

“Since we arrived at Pitt in 1980, Oxanna has been our contact
and support for the improvement of the library on the [ship],”
Semester at Sea Executive Director John Tymitz said.

“Because of her efforts, the library is now in the best condition
and continued to improve under her leadership’ every year. All

_ of the staff at Semester at Sea are deeply saddened by her loss

and will miss her tremendously,” T ymitz said.

Rentler is survived by her husband, Philip; her mother, Anna
Sprynsk; and her sister, Li Tanku

No funeral services will be held, but Tobias said he hopes to

arrange a memorial service that students, staff and faculty may 0

attend. _
Memorial contributions may be made to the Hillman Library

universal system in which the

The board would dictate a list

preventative medicine. Under

that $300 worth of prenatal care

In his proposal Wofford said
that f‘our bill breaks the existing
link between health coverage and
employment, a link which
increasingly ties people to jobs
long after they should or could
have left for something better.
That link puts employers in the

business of arranging for health

care instead of making better
products at competitive prices.”

The government’s inability- to
pass a national health—care plan,
coupled with scandals like the
House bank, leave Americans
with a sense of resentment,
Wofford said.

“For too long the health-care
debate has been a symbol of the
political gridlock among parties
and interest groups that frustrates
our people with the government’s
inability, and it’s producing some
of the anger that we've seen in

Wofford said.

I feel that longer hours is
conducive to creating an
environment of learning,” Smith
said.

Smith said she felt longer hours
would attract more students.
_ “The number of people
studying in the cathedral at night
is so much more compared to the
library. [At the libraries] you have

 

the benefits of the library materials
to access [rather] than in the
cathedral or wherever, and the
lighting is so bad in the cathedral,”
she said.

Although the survey is presently

in circulation, Smith said she is I

revising it. She said she wants to
direct it exclusively to residents
on campus. She said she’ll use
these students as a prototype to

gauge what all students want.
“Doing a revision will better my
argument about extending the
hours,” she said.By doing it this
way Smith said she feels she’ll get
a wider and better response.
Smith hopes to have the revised
version done by next week so
everything will be completed

T ax deduction benefit

Students know financing an education can be a burden
one will live with for many years. With decreases in
financial aid and the increase in tuition, loans have
become a means to finance higher education. For many
years, increases in tuition at American universities continue
to outpace inﬂation.

Every year students add to their total bill thousands of
dollars in order to attend the University of Pittsburgh and
other institutions across the country.

While a student loan is an investment in oneself, the
burden is adding weight to the shoulders of those ready
to graduate. Roughly 50 percent of students dependon
federal-loan assistance for support. Debts can range from
$10,000 to $100,000 — paybacks can last 30 years for
some graduates. ‘ V

According to Devon C. Sadlowski, president of the
American Student Dental Association at the University of
Pittsburgh, the average debt for dental students is $50,000,
while at Pitt the amount exceeds $80,000.

Of course advanced degrees will amass a greater debt
for the student. As more undergraduate students opt for
graduate and professional—school degrees, student-loan
debt will climb.

The burden of debt can be seen as acting as a deterrent
against higher education and advanced degrees. This is
especially true for lower/rniddle-income students and
minority students.

As of 1986, the Tax Reform Act eliminated the deduction
for “consumer” interest to eschew over-reliance on credit.
However student-loans’ interest fell victim to the tax
reform. .

Elimination of the deduction for student-loan interest

hurts families and students who depend on the loans as .

the only means available to attend institutions of higher
‘education. , ‘

Currently two pieces of legislation, H.R. 747 and S. 2160,
are aimed at restoring an income-tax deduction for
interest paid on educational loans.

Restoring the deduction is a sound move for investments
in education. . — V '

_An interest deduction is importantfor; students-

mounds of debt, in particular lower—income students and
minority students ’

After graduation, many students receive low earnings
and interest on the student-loan repayment will be a large
portion of the loan repayment.

In the House of Representatives and in the Senate, the
legislation is moving through legislative subcommittees.
Support for the H.R. 747 and S; 2160 is needed to ensure
passage. p

Students approaching graduation this year may find
themselves with a huge debt on their shoulders. Now is
the time to act.

Summertime party advice

Whether you accept the
inevitable or not, summer is
coming.

The temperature outside might
be freezing and snowﬂakes may
be falling, but it will change.
Soon.

Just think of it. Could you really
pull yourself away from doing
calculus or reading Shakespeare
or even learning German? You
bet you could.

Summer is a time to celebrate.
Despite the possible
encumbrances of a summer job,
you should be happy to learn
that you do not have to.wake up
for that eight o'clock lab any
more.

Three weeks left 
counting.

and

Now some people may go to, ,5

foreign lands — others to the
shore or the mountains, while
still some may not leave
Pittsburgh.

Picture it.

You are preparing for a day at
the beach. You get your suntan
oil, towels, food from the
refrigerator (since you STILL have
no money) and other things (extra
money, drinks, a magazine and
that “protection” for a possible
chance encounter) and head for
the sand.

Look at what you are bringing.
Go" through the items one
environmental step at a time.

The suntan oil comes in a plastic
container. Now I doubt that you
will use the entire bottle on the

first day, but you will, over the '

cou rsc of the beach and backyard
tans, finish the bottle.

There is a simple solution:
Recycle the bottle. Do not leave
it sitting in the closet, right next to
the shoes and that lost sock. (Oh,

, THAT is where it was.)

Either set it out for the garbage

collection or bring it downto be
recycled with the rest of the plastic
that accumulates over the week.
You will be surprised at the
amounts of . plastic that you do
have at the end of one week.
Next: the towels. You rip one;
it gets really dirty; the dog has an
“accident” on it; whatever. You
can tear it up and use it for rags;

wash the car with some instead
of using paper towels.

Besides the obvious waste,
paper towels leave small scratches
on - the c’:;tr,Es'urE_'ace‘,7i' which ruins

the paint. Rags are a better,’ more ‘

efficient and less wasteful
resource.

You have to wrap the food in
something. Leave the plastic bags
in the drawer, and wrap
everything in alumintim foil. The
aluminum foil can be used, when
finished, in a variety of ways.

You can use it to reﬂect and
amplify the sun (to get at those
hard to reach places), use it again
to rewrap the food that you want
to save for later, or even use it for,

ahem, unlawful purposes with’

various illegal substances (or so I
am told).

So do not just pitch that foil; it
can be used and reused in many
ways. , V

The drinks either come in
bottles, cans or kegs. All can be
either recycled or reused, so 
to make an effort. If you throw a
party, set aside a bag to collect
cans.

The next morning (or
afternoon, whenever you wake
up), take the cans to the recycling

center. It will save space and
help save the planet, too.

Do not leave that empty keg
lying around either. Get it back to
the beer distributor (the deposit
is one thing) so that it can be
reused or reﬁlled for you or
another person. _

The magazine or book that you
choose to bring can be recycled
as well. The magazine, if glossy,
should be recycled with the other
m_agaz_,ines,,but if it is .non_..—glossy

other newspapers that will pile
up unread on your doorstep. -
Try to read at leastrone book
this summer, and not one of
those trashy, Jackie Collins novels
either —— a real book. Nicholson
Baker's VOX is a quick read, or

"for the more adventurous, try

Trinityby Leon Uris. Real news is
too depressing to read in the
summer, and I try to avoid it at all
costs. ‘

As for the protection, well, try

to use it. You want to come back _

from the summer with memories
— not diseases.

I want to leave you with one
final thought: The energy that
you use this summer can also be
reused and saved. Ride a bike;
walk instead of taking an elevator.
It will make you feel good and
work on those last minute “bodily
imperfections” that you have been
complaining about since winter
but never got around to fixing;

So, people, I hope that this
summer leaves you with many
fond memories, but above all
make it an environmentally
friendly summer. There is not
much to it. Start now, and you
may actually have a clean beach
to go to.

In its second warmup regatta of the
spring season, the Pitt crew team nabbed
two first-place finishes, three seconds and
three thirds over the weekend at thejohns

— Hopkins Invitational in Baltimore, Md.

The Panthers finished second overall,
falling only to .Eastern rowing power
George Washington.

According to head coach Joel Kehm,
both the men’s and women’s teams
performed admirably against the high-

powered Colonials and the field of 12
schools. a

“Overall, we had a re‘ally good regatta,”
Kehm said. “lGeorge Washington is] a big,
established program. Competing at their
level is a good sign.”

What was surely a good sign for Kehm
was the continued dominance of his men’s
varsity four boat. Under the call of Leanna
Hopkins, the fearsome foursome of Pete
Alporn, Bob Falk, John Daugherty and
Matt Precthel blew away the field in a
performance Kehm deemed head and
shoulders above the rest.

Crew places Iaighat Hopkins warmup regatta

“The effort of our varsity men’s four was
our most impressive performance of the
weekend,” Kehm said. “They were
definitely the class of the regatta.”

The success of the heavy four boat is no
surprise to Kehm, who noted that it took
the experience of facing opposing boats in
a competitive setting to convince the rowers
of their true potential.

“Going into the spring, they knew they
had the speed,” Kehm said, “but against no
competition in practice they weren’t sure
until the season got underway.”

ability stems from the fact that Pitt has
been plagued with weather constraints,
which have hindered practice and regatta
scheduling.

And while the recentbreak in the weather
has coincided perfectly with the return of
the baseball Pirates to town, the return of
sunny skies and warm temps has been
long in coming for Kehm’s crew. As the
Bucs basked in the beaming Bradenton,
Fla., sun for the duration of spring training,
Panther crew members endured less than
springlike conditions on the Allegheny

Pitt rugby
defeats
Scranton

By Derek Willis

Sports Editor

The Panther Rugby Football
Club bounced back from a
halftime deficit to defeat the
University of Scranton on

Saturday, 14-6.

Pitt scored the only points of
the second half after trailing 6-4
at halftime. john Lewis scored all
three tries for the Panthers, and
Brian Hannen added an after-try
in the. game, which took place at
Haverford College, outside
Philadelphia.

“We had trouble in the first
half,” Lewis said, “but in the

, second’ half we played better. We

kept the ball in their end."

The Panthers finally got the
advantage on a second—half try
that “broke them," according to
Lewis. “We expected them to
have a better back line, but they
dropped some balls and that led

to the final try,” he said. “We also _

missed some penalty kicks, which

would have made the score even

larger.”

' Pitt improves to 3-0 on the
spring season and has yet to" give
up a try this year to an opponent.
Scranton scored its points on two
penalty kicks. Scranton, a member
of the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby
Union, was a tough rnatchup for
Pitt.

“It shows our strength,” Lewis
said. “They're at a little higher
skill level because they play a
tougher schedule. It shows we're
establishing ourselves, to beat an
eastern team.” '

Pitt travels to Salisbury State in
Maryland for a Saturday match.

“I’ve heard they're really good,”
Lewis said. ‘

year student Staci Suggs
finished sixth with an
impressive, ECAC—qualifying
time of 15.91 seconds.

She finished behind some
very" impressive and
experienced runners — a
woman’s indoor runner up, a
former NCAA champion and a
junior indoor champion.Kim
Blair finished one spot behind
Suggs, and Ronise Crumpler
placed ninth.

The 4x100-meter relay team

Pitt track star Keisha Demas
won the event with a time of

 53.67. .

‘ Crumpler finished second

Hockaday placed fourth at
56.10. All three were ECAC-
qualifying times.Blair finished
second in the 400-meter
hurdles with a time of 1:01.67,
while Suggs came in fourth at
1:06.29. Once more, both were
ECAC—qualifying times. V

Junior Laura O'Donnell came
in fourth in the 1,500—meter
race with a timeof 4:35.26.
She, too, was an ECAC qualifier
for that event.

Jason I-Iillrnan/I‘ he Pitt News

The women's track team posted several ECAC qualifying times at Saturday's Gatorade Invitational.

Fellow junior Joanne Warner
performed well in the field
events, finishing third in the
discus (42.42 meters), third in
the javelin event and second in
the shot put. Warner also was an

ECAC qualifier.

First-year student Stacy Roth
also placed in the field events,
recording an eighth place in the
shot put, 10th in the discus and
fourth in the javelin with a throw

of 31.84 meters.

after this latest meet. “We’re

«happy, very satisfied,” he said. ’

“We feel we're pointed in the

P647! 3: In The End

i n fmvcmber 19871 came to Pittsburgh
for the first time to watch the Pitt-Penn
Ztatr: game that year. I remember how
much energy there was on campus that
day.

'lhcrc was a huge tailgate party in the

middle of the afternoon at what used to be
the Syria Mosque parking lot. People were
everywhere. I told my coach, who was
with me, this -is where I am’ going to
school. I had made up my mind: Pitt was
where I wanted to be.

Then in December I took a recruiting
trip to Pitt, already knowing that when the
scholarship was offered, I was going to
accept. When I left on Sunday I was
recalling the weekend in my mind, and the
one thing that stood out the most was
something Tony Dorsett said on a video.

Dorsett said that no matter what he does

in life, the name Tony Dorsett and the
University of Pittsburgh will be associated
together.

Four years later, as I look back on my
time at Pitt, I think am beginning to feel
some of that same “Pitt Pride” Dorsett
mentioned. ‘

I will forever be able to say I played
football at the same school as Dorsett, Dan
Marino, Bill Fralic, etc. That is a great
feeling of satisfaction to know I have
accomplished something. I played at Pitt,
and nothing can change that. -

This‘ “Pitt Pride" is not something only

athletes can feel; it is something all of us
should be able to understand. As students,
you will go on with your lives, and your
name, like Dorsett’s, will always be
associated with Pitt. .-L.

Right now. you may not feel gratitude
toward the university, but 20 ‘years from
now when the intern in your office asks
where you did your undergraduate work,
with pride you'll say, “Pitt,”

So what's gotten me so emotional about
this school? Well, I’ll tell you.

scrimmage. But before next year’s
varsity team takes the field, the
alumni will engage in a friendly
game of flag football.And what
brings these guys back in town is
their passion for this university.
Right now we might not feel’ that
same passion for Pitt, but
eventually the love of our youth

will bring us back for a visit, too.

Sometimes I run into “old guys”
who tell me about their playing

days at Pitt, and for some reason
I am interested. I guess there will
always be that common bond
between guys who fought for the
same cause. No matter how many
generations separate us, Pitt
football players are a brotherhood
— like. a fraternity.

Once again, not only athletes
should feel this way. When you

Pennsylvania, training for the
spring campaign.

The toughest opposition the
crew team has faced thisspring
— more times than not -— has
been the weather. Already this
spring one regatta has been
cancelled and several practices
were interrupted by inclement
weather. F or“most crew members,
enduring grueling, cold-weather
practices and regattas is a routine
well rehearsed. Unless someone
puts a dome over the
Monongahela, Allegheny or Ohio
(or any river on the east coast)
anytime soon, bad weather will

always be a part of rowing.
Whereas players of other spring
sports, like baseball and tennis,
can stay sharp with indoor
training, crew members cannot
possibly simulate the on-water
experience necessary to produce

and sustain. That means one thing:
outdoor training. In Pittsburgh .

and cities eastward, that means
trouble.

Trouble reared its ugly head
for the final heats of the regatta,
as the sunny, clear Baltimore skies
turned into a dreary, windy, cold
afternoon in a matter of minutes,
forcing the distance of all finals

of her boat to the team’s improved
off-season training.

“We weren’t as prepared last

fall. Our endurance was not at
the level that it is now, and it’s
making a big difference.”

Kehm also had high praise for
the boat, which he says provided
the regatta’s best race.

“The women’s four boat race
was the most exciting race of the
weekend,” Kehm said. “No more
than a 10th ofa second separated
the four crews.

“With only 500 meters left, the
boat was three strokes down,”
Kehm said, “and within 20 strokes
that three-stroke deficit turned
into a one-stroke lead.”

Other boats with top finishes
included the women’s va rsity four
lightweight crew of Leslie

  

    

Burchett, Andrea Zicherman,
Lorin Gaylord, Lori Shofran and
coxswain Jannine Markizon,
which placed second overall, and
two novice boats — men's four
and women’s eight— which also
finished a bridesmaid.

In the two-man boat
competition, the pair of Todd
Ridenour and Bert Losken took a
commendable third overall. ‘

As far as any disappointments
over the weekend, Kehm noted
his displeasure with the efforts of
somelof his novice boats.

“I think some of our novice
boats weren’t at their best because
of a letdown over the cancellation
of last weekend’s regatta,” Kehm
said. “To get pumped up for your
first race and see it get canceled
has to be a letdown. They’ll be
fine.”

Next weekend Pitt travels to
Camden, NJ. for the LaSalle
Invitational.
