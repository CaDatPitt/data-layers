Theater  
department
faces budget
drama

Senior Staff Writer

Whenthe cur1ainfalls,thedramarea1ly
begins in Pitt’s Department ofTheatre
A113.

Students are riled up over the de-
partment’s decision to rent out its play
space for 11 of the 16 weeks for the fall
-2011 semester. Many feel thatthe Uni-
versity is more concerned with making
aproﬁtthanwid1educa11'ngtheaterst11-
dents, but administrators saythe rental
deal is necessary to secure ﬁinding for
the elaborate plays the department
puts on. ’ ‘

The issue of space is an issue rooted
in dollars and cents. In 2003, the De-

partment of Theatre Arts was looking‘-

forapartnerto supplement its budget,
a theater company that would pay a
fair fee and offer smdenm educational
beneﬁts in returnfor use of the depart-
ment’s theaterspacelocatedinthe Ste-
phen Foster Memorial.

At the time, Pittsburgh Irish and
ClassicalTheatrewaslookingforaplace
to put on its performances and a mar-
riage of convenience was born.

Theatre Arts chair Bruce McCo-
nachie said the departrnent’s annual
budget will be about $150,000. He
 $40,000 of that budget comes
directly from the Irish Theatre’s rental
payments.

“We can’t do the seasons we do
without that kind of income.” McCo-
nachie said.‘ \ g

In the fall, the department plans to
perform SweeneyTodd, atypically cost-

Pitt experts investigate riskybehaviors

‘ Study of rat brains points to answers about teenage and young adult choices with drugs and drinking

Ian Pisarcik
. For The Pitt News

The results of a Pitt lab rat study
might change the way people are
educated about drugs and alco-
hol. A

In a recent study, Pitt research- '

ers studied college-aged people’s
tendency to weigh immediate
beneﬁts of a behavior over the

long-term risks. The project found
that the tendencies of high school
and college students to engage in
risky behaviors like drinking and
experimenting with drugs could
have biological origins.
According to the study, adoles-
cent rat brains experience stron-
ger feelings of excitement and less
inhibition than adult brains..The
increased responsiveness to re-
wards shown in the adolescent

brain “could reveal the teenage
propensity to consider rewards
over consequences,” Pitt spokes-

' man Morgan Kelly said in a press
. release.

Led by Bita ,M0ghaddam, a
small team of researchers admin-
istered tests where the goal was
for the lab rat to attain afood pel-
let. Electrode readouts were ob-
served in both the adolescent and
adult rats in the experiments.

The adolescent rats displayed
a signiﬁcantly greater reaction
to rewards, while they displayed
a lesser reaction to the risks in-
volved. The adolescents also dis-
played less organization. in their
thoughts than the adults, an ef-
fect visible in the rapid surges of
excitement and low levels of in-
hibitors in the adolescent brains
during the tests. ‘

IrishTheatre’s contributions. Students,
however, argue that without sufficient
access to practice spaces, the show
might struggle to ﬁnd its footing.

“Theater is all about practice,” ju-
nior Ben Coppola said. “The more you
do it, the better youget at it. Ifwe can’t
practice because PICT’s in that space,
we can’t get better.”

Junior Casey Lazor has similar
frustrations. “Overall, itseems likethis
ﬁnancial, lucrative deal is more impor-
tant than students,” she said.

In total, the University owns three
theaters. The Steven FosterMemorialis
hometotwo stages, the Charity Randall
and Henry Heymanntheaters.Thereis
athird stage, the Studio Theater, inthe
Cathedral of Learning’s basement.

When the Irish Theatre uses the

that reads. “Prompt-Polite—Pre-
pared.” The program offers stu-
dents a pancake breakfast if they
are recognized for academic and
behavioral excellence.

“It’s an ongoing problem,”
Richard Dziubek, the vice prin-
cipal of South Park, said. “It’s dif-
ﬁcult for students, particularly
underclassmen, to respond [to

academic disciplining] without

an immediate reward.”

It is not until adulthood that .

“world view becomes a reality
rather than a concept,” Dziubek
said.

Forstudents, rewards go be-
yond the physical. Angela Mills,
South Park’s guidance counselor,
said that during the developmen-

space in the Steven Foster Memorial,
it occupies one stage, leaving just two
other ‘stages for the student theater
groups, including Pittsburgh Reper-
tory Theater, Red—eye Theater and the
Department ofTheatre Arts itself. The
result is often tight practice schedules
and frustrated students.

At a department meeting on Mon-
day, students gathered to express their
concernstoPittadministrators.McCo-
nachie recognized at the meeting that
the shortage of space is an issue. I

“I have complete sympathy for the
problems we’re having with" lack of

Local high school administrators
agree with study results

Behavior 4 2

tal stages occurring between seventh and
12th grade, adolescents demand attention
and mental nourishment.

The issue is complicated by the inﬁnite
variables of “personal experience, child-
hood history and environment,” Mills said.
“These factors have an impact on how and
to what students respond to.”

Those who receive less support at home
respond better to “hands on treatment”
at school. This means these students are
congratulated and encouraged on a daily
basis. Like the rats, students perceive so-
cial acceptance and personal freedom as
rewards for negative behavior.

Positive academic behavior often lacks
the short-term beneﬁts to which adoles-
cents will respond. Like Dziubek, Mills
pointed out that this is an ongoing chal-
lenge for secondary educators and sup-
port staff. V

On campus, most traditional Pitt stu-
dents are still within the age range where
this increased beneﬁt analysis occurs.
Within the context of the University atmo-
sphere, this presents considerable danger
to students. For example, students might
be more likely to consider the short-term

rewards of party behavior over the poten-
tial health issues associated with these
actions.

Living outside the realm of parental
control, students experience a degree of
personal freedom that Mills and Dziubek
don’t usually have to consider. Particularly,
balancing academic goals with social and
personal desires can be difﬁcult for college
students.

Sturman added that the study is par-
ticularly relevant to college students, as
other studies have shown that the prefron—
tal cortex — the general section of the brain
involved in risk analysis — is still not fully
developed until a person is into their early
twenties.

“Even when behavior is very similar, [the
adolescent brain] processes motivational
stimuli very differently,” Sturman said.

Whereas the study was initially focused
on behavioral differences between youths
and adults, the researchers quickly real-

' ized that the internal responses were also

a point of interest. Sturman speculated
that this information could bring standard
methods of educating young people into
question. I;

Keep trafficking
in mind Sunday

he Super Bowl is a formal-
I ized expression of the tri-
umphs of American society.
Our national unity is patriotically
voiced during the “Star-Spangled
Banner,” our vibrant diversity is
reﬂected in fans of different colors
and creeds who ﬁll the stadium
seats, our bountiful prosperity
andfood supply embossed upon
the players’ highly paid, hulking
musculature — to any onlooker,
the “big game” is an awe—inspiring
celebration of Americana, nothing
short of ajuly 4 in February.

But putting the physical and
metaphysical ﬁreworks aside, in
bringing out all that is the United
States, the Super Bowl can also
highlight this country’s darker
realities. And we’re not talking
about beer commercials.

As thousands of Pittsburghers
direct their eyes toward Texas
on Sunday to watch the Steelers
battle the Green Bay Packers, we
hope they don’t overlook an issue
we normally wouldn’t associate
with the Super Bowl ——- human
trafﬁcking.

“The Super Bowl is one of the
biggest human trafficking events
in the United States,” Texas At-
torney General Greg Abbott said
in an MSNBC article published
Tuesday. In the article, the attor-
ney general’s office said that up to
10,000 adults and minors were
brought to previous Super Bowls
for trafﬁcking purposes, and Dee-
na Graves — executive director of
the advocacy group Trafﬁck911 ——.
said that in just the last two Super
Bowls, law enforcement agencies
and advocacy groups have rescued
about 50 girls.

According to the federal Traf-
ﬁcking Victims Protection Act,
human trafficking is “The recruit-
ment, harboring, transportation,

provision, or obtaining of a person
for the purpose of a commercial
sex act where such an act is in-
duced by force, fraud, or coercion,
or in which the person induced to
perform such act has not attained

, 18 years.” Underage victims often

undergo beatings and psychologi-
cal manipulation from their pimps
and stigmatization from the gen-
eral public.

The advocates say that many
Americans fail to realize the ex-
tent of the problem in the United
States, or that it even exists, in
the ﬁrst place. Ernie Allen, the
president of the National Center
for Missing & Exploited Children,
said, “The best estimates, the
best data, suggests that we have
at least have 100,000 American
kids a year  victimized through
the practice of child prostitution;
that number rangesas high as
30o,000,” according to a 2007
report by Shared Hope Interna-
tional.

As of press time, a Change;
org—sponsored petition to get the
Super Bowl Host Committee to
publicly rebuke human trafﬁcking
garnered 72,000 signatures.

Living amidst the prosperity

of Western life —— that which al- ‘

lows us to focus on something as
nonsubsistence and individually
irrelevant as the Super Bowl — we
often conveniently delegate to far-
away countries the darker shades
of human behavior. The thought
of children being sold for sex in
Pittsburgh, Green Bay or Arling-
ton, Texas, deserves a better word
than “unsettling.” Regardless of

‘how difﬁcult mentally handling
. this issue might be, Steelers fans

should at least try to keep it in
mind during the Super Bowl rev-
elries that are sure to take place
this weekend. .

Damaging property, lighting ﬁres

Pittsburgh into something akin to’

a sister city of Cairo for a night —
whatever size the crowds become
after the Super Bowl, ’Burgh resi-
dents would be wise to bunker down
anyway. 0

While our collegiate sports
teams in this city have a prestigious
history of choking in big games, our
professional ones don’t. That said,

if history were to repeat itself, I ex- _

pect that most students of this city’s
universities will be ﬂooding out into
the streets in the name of celebra-
tion this Sunday night;

Three years agoat this time, I
could probably be found in front
of a computer looking at YouTube
footage from the 2005 Super Bowl
aftermath. I had not yet been indoc-
trinated into much of the culture
here, but I learned from older stu-
dents’ stories just how wild it got.

The Sunday night before the
game in 2009, as Iwalked back from

Jacob Brown -

the Cathedral, I saw parking meters
covered with black and gold “No
Parking” signs. Their purpose was
ancillary, mainly because there were
no cars on Forbes Avenue.
Likely, everyone was already get-
ting ready for the game.
, I kept one of the signs that had

‘fallen on the ground as a souvenir.

That would be the extent of my un-
ruliness.

With parking control, the po-
lice might have had an idea of the
events that were to unfold, but they
were woefully unprepared for them.
The streets ﬂooding with 15,000
students and $150,000 worth of
damage proved that. 5 '

I went back out at 2 am. to see
hazmat and waste crews cleaning
up everything from the wire frames
of torched couches tobroken glass
and collapsed bus shelters.

After the crowds disperse, ask
yourself if it was really worth it. It
might be fun at the time to revel in
victory, but witnessing night crews
quietly attempting to restore some
civility to the area is a bit depress-
ing. .

This year, some groups are re-
sorting to social media campaigns

to help convince Pitt students to
celebrate responsibly. As to wheth-
er or not I am attending, I clicked
“Maybe.”

In all honesty, there are more
than a few reasons to change Oak-
land’s infrastructure," although I
cannot condone eviscerating it.
Perhaps your couch has bedbugs
or some frat party—created stain on
it that you’re hesitant to identify.

V There’s a possibility that such a
piece of furniture could spread dis-
ease, perhaps a new plague created
by a combination of the fermented
bacteria in alcohol coupled with the
ﬁlth in the typical South Oakland
abode.

‘Or say you’re anti-establishment
and loathe politics in Pittsburgh.

I Since the city’s treasury is well into

the negatives, it’s not exactly a high
priority of lawmakers to have to pay
police overtime for their services,
especially after City Council nar-
rowly escaped a state takeover. ‘

Ithink that could spell the end to -

all of their political aspirations.

Narration is the silent workhorse of
storytelling. Although it usually goes
unnoticed, it is both the mediator and
most important character in a story.
Narration controls howwe receive the
sequence of the story, what informa-
tion is available to us and how we will
perceive characters and events. Whﬂe

narration is usually content with its
humble background role, sometimes
ittakes on too muchﬂairto be ignored.
That is the case in both plays currently
being offered as a two-fer by Pitt Rep-
ertory Theatre. ‘Authorial Intent” and
“The Well ofHorniness” are plays that
derive their value not from their con-
tent but from the forms in which they
reach us. '
‘Authorial Intent’ ’byHolly Hughes
— athoughtful, three-scene play only
ernployingtwo characters — is atightly
written success. Each scene parallels
the others, telling the same story ina
unique way. Every scene begins, as so
many plays do, with the female char-
acteratanisland countertop doingher
makeup. The play makes explicit use of
theater cliches as away of exposingthe
narrative process.Whyhave the female
character doing her makeup? To keep
her still so thatthe male character can
rush around the room unimpeded, of

COLIFSE.

The second scene makes the narra-
tive strategy ofthe playintheﬁrstscene
explicit. It is the same scene, only now
the actorsaresupposedto mechanically
relay the objectives, tactics and over-
arching “authorial intent” of director
Allie Coldewey. The scene is absurdly
surreal, as the actors must alternate
ﬁom robotic expositions of the narra-
tive strategyto emotional utterances of
their most important lines.

‘ The third scene depicts the actors
disassembling after their ﬁnal per-
formance. The female introduces the
scene in exactly the same position. As
a ritual, she likes to remove her makeup
onstage. Itisherway of cuttingtieswith
her characters. Then the male actor
enters inhispost—productionat1ire and
asks her out. This development opens
up ample opportunities for references
to the interior play and to the conven-
tions oftheater. Bythe end of the scene,
he repeats the same line to her with
which his character had closed during

Feb. 3-6
John Tellem
Benedum Center
Tickets $18-$45

412-456-6666 or pgharts.org

When one actorwalks onto Benedum
Center’s stage performing as a lemur
this weekend, it might be hard for the
audience to resist singing along with
the incredibly catchy lyrics: “I like to
move it, move it.”

Drew Hirshﬁeld plays Kingjulien
in “Madagascar Live,” afamily musi-
cal based on the 2005 Dreamworks
animated ﬁlm “Madagascar.” The
90-minute show is the ﬁrst live pro-
duction by Dreamworks Theatricals,

which produces stage productions

based on Dreamworks ﬁlms.
The showfollows a group ofﬁiend—
 animals raised in Central Park Zoo

that are unexpectedly shipped from
New York and shipwrecked on the
island of Madagascar. Alex the lion,
Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe
and Gloria the hippo soon meet with
the island locals and must adapt to
their new surroundings.
Takingastory between two medi-
ums is pretty common, but not always

an easy task for directors. But since

part of theater is creating aworld for
people to step into, taking a ﬁlm to
the stage is a little easier because the
world has already been envisioned,
according to Lisajackson-Schebetta,
assistant professorinthe Department
of Theatre Arts.

“The challenge with a show such
as this is meetingﬁlmic expectations,”
Jackson-Schebetta said in an e—mail.

However, ]ackson—Schebetta
stressed that the two different me-

diums just offer two ways of looking,

at the same project and “Madagascar
Live” will probably do things that the
ﬁlm could not.

“[Theater] engages the imagina-
tion in different ways. It asks us to
imagine along with the actors and
story on stage,” she said.

Hirshﬁeld was intrigued by the
ideaand imaginationbehind the show
from the beginning, attending audi-
tion after audition before receiving
the part of Kingjulien, a lemur who
rules over his tribe on Madagascar. '

Hirshﬁeld plays one of the small-
est animals in the show. Aurelia Wil-
liams, however, plays one of the larg-
est: Gloria the hippo. . ’

Originally a psychology and
education major, Williams began to
sing in high school for fun, but never
took singing seriouslyuntilafriend in
graduate school urged her to audition
for shows. Williams took the advice
and began receiving callbacks and

, job offers even before she ﬁnished

her degrees.

Williams ﬁnished school and re-
ceived her bachelor’s degree in psy-
chology from Rutgers University and

a subsequent master’s degree in el-

ementary education, but she opted to
go forward with her theater career.
“My parents thought it was too
important to at least try,” Williams
said. A
The ideawas that if she didn’t like
it, she could go back to the educa-

tion ﬁeld, Williams said. Eleven years a

later, she has no interests in leaving,
and her favorite roles on the stage
let her laugh and make the audience
laugh as well. v _

Williams thinks that the role of
Gloria is perfect for her.

“Gloria is hilarious,” Williams
said. “I cannot wait to get an audi-
ence in there because we’re laughing
just as a cast and crew.”

Williams was already a fan of the
movie when she heard about audi-
tions. The live show has more songs
than the movie and also expands on
the characters and jokes that played
on screen, Williams said.

The biggest challenge isn’t the

.14-vJLIb¢A-Al/LAAAQD

singing or the dancing, Williams" said.
The biggest challenge is the fact that
she plays a hippo and has to dress
like one. i

“I’ve never played an animal, num-
ber one, much less ahippopotamus,”
Williams said. “My costume is just big
with abig booty. Gloria is famous for
that at this point. The spatial aware-
ness with this costume isa little dif-

_ ferent. I have to watch out because I

can knock things over.”
The costumes are apoint ofinter—
est for Hirshﬁeld as well, since they

' do pose a “particular challenge,” he

said.

. “The costumes are bulky,” Hirsh-
ﬁeld said. “They are absolutely amaz-
ingto look at —‘beautiﬁrl, incredibly
creative, elaborate — but because
they are so unique they do create
some challenges for the actors.” _

“Each costumes is made from
various materials speciﬁc, to each
animal,” Williams said. “Mine is made
from a wrinkly velvet material like

Steel City needs quintessential ﬁlm

Andy Tybout
Assistant A8'E Editor

 

In light of the impending Super Bowl, it’s
a safe bet many Pittsburghers will take to
3 invoking, for their Packers-fan brethren, our
: region’s considerable historical and cultural
 contributions. But unlike, say, New Yorkers,
:. Pittsburgh locals might ﬁnd they’re at a loss
1-when it comes to name—dropping their city’s
 deﬁning ﬁlm. '
 Allow me, then, to set the record
}straight.
‘ A few weeks ago, after critics at New
York Magazine were asked to name what
they considered to be the quintessential
New York novel, song, artwork and ﬁlm —
for the record, “Dog Day Afternoon” won
;the latter title —— I was inspired to reach my
town verdict on a movie that epitomized a
{certain city. Only this time, that city would
’;be Pittsburgh.

 Of course, I can’t purport to have seen ’

all the ﬁlms shot in the Steel City. The John
§Wayne drama “Pittsburgh” (1942), for in-
 stance, has yet eluded me. I can, however,
 claim fairly corriprehensive experience with
§the classics. Accordingly, the ﬁnalists for the
' title of Ultimate Pittsburgh Movie, like those
of New York Magazine’s, are a smattering of
the usual suspects —— “Night of the Living
“Dead” (1968), “The Deer Hunter” (1978) and
“Dawn of the Dead” (1978) — supplemented
by afew less—acclaimed gems: “Wonder Boys”
(2000) and “Zack and Miri Make a Porno”
(2008). . _
Conspicuously absent on this list are ﬁlms
gthat were shot in Pittsburgh (“Dogma,” “The
;,;Silence of the Lambs”), but don’t attribute the
§location as such. Also conspicuously absent
 ﬁlms that look, quite frankly, too aw-
ﬁll —' “The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh,” for
instance — to merit my attention.
As for my means of evaluating the ﬁlms,
ffthe ﬁnalists needed to meet two sets of crite-
"-‘ria in order to be deemed the Ultimate Pitts-

‘ﬁﬁll? ck‘

burgh Movie: First, they needed to be intrin-
sically excellent and second, they needed to
somehow encapsulate the Pittsburgh spirit.
Ideally, the winner would be both the ﬁnest
ﬁlm on the list and the most Pittsburgh-y.
At ﬁrst glance, “The Deer Hunter” would

‘seem to best fulﬁll the latter criteria. After all,

whereas the movie’s non—Vietnam sequences
are centered mostly in a town that’s actually
25 minutes south of Pittsburgh, you’d be hard
pressed to ﬁnd characters more ensconced
in the city’s culture: De Niro and company
drink Rolling Rock, watch the Steelers, work
in a steel mill and, of course, hunt deer. As
an ethnography of Western Pennsylvania,
Michael Cimino’s Oscar—winning epic-is un-
matched. , ‘

Nevertheless, it’s somewhat disingenu-
ous to label “The Deer Hunter” a ﬁlm about
Pittsburgh: Quite clearly, it’s a ﬁlm about
Vietnam and its psychological aftermath.
Accordingly, the most powerful moments
in the movie — most notably the Russian
roulette sequences — are worlds removed
from our beloved Steel City. The characters’
wholesome hometown merely serves as afoil
for the jungle. In reality, “The Deer Hunter”
could have been ﬁlmed in nearly any small
American municipality.

“Dawn of the Dead,” although set mostly
in the nearby Monroeville Mall, feels similarly
nonregional: The ﬁlm’s blistering critique of
consumerism is directed invariably at them-
tire nation. Tellingly, the word “Pittsburgh”
is never even mentioned. ‘

Ultimatelyl was led to bestow the title on
George Romero’s earlier and more ground-
breaking ﬁlm, “Night of the Living Dead”
(1968). Although its racial commentary —
which comes on particularly strong during
the ﬁnal scene — is, again’, meant for a na-
tional audience, “Living Dead” is nonethe-

less a movie with an inextricably Western ‘

Pennsylvania look and feel. Set mostly in a
farmhouse and populated by a host of prag-
matic locals, Romero’s debut takes pains to
incorporate the region’s geography —— refer-

It is very difficult for an actor in a play to play
an actor in a play, particularly if the character is
inherently ﬂawed,‘because thereare so many levels

 for. But Max Reusing and Nina Stamerdo itproﬁ—

ciently. When playingactors in aplay, they overact
in the stereotypical, overwrought manner that
many second-rate theater actors do. Butas actors

More importantly, “Night of the Living
Dead” exempliﬁes the scrappy ingenuity Pitts-

Romero popularized an entire genre of horror

to Steel City resourcefulness, “Night of the

A Locals, feel free to disagree with me —
this is, after all, a purely subjective judgment.
This much, however, is inarguable: Before

FOOTBALL

itt anunes 2011 recruiting class

Kenny Ongl Staff Photographer

Pitt head coach Todd Graham discussed the incoming class during a '

press conference at Heinz Field yesterday.

 

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

The recruiting process for college
football begins well over a year
in advance of National Letter of
Intent Day, the ﬁrst day that high
school seniors can officially sign

on to play for a college the follow- .

ing season.

But Pitt head football coach
Todd Graham took office just
three weeks ago, meaning he and
his staff had to squeeze a year’s
worth of recruiting into a short
amount of time. So after the hand-
shakes were over and Graham was
introduced to the fans at a press
conference and a basketball game,
he hit the recruiting trail.

Graham announced a 2o—per—
son recruiting class yesterday,
featuring two four-star players
and 10 three-star players, ac-
cording to Riva1s.com. Eighteen
of those players have already sent
their signed letters of intent, gen-

erally the last major step of the
recruiting process.

“My coaching staff has done a
tremendous job in a short period
of time to turn this thing around,”
Graham said during a press con-
ference at Heinz Field yesterday.
“They called upon existing rela-
tionships as well as created new
relationships.”

Of the 18 recruits who signed
yesterday, only four were from
former head coach Dave Wannst-
edt’s original class of 17 — a class
considered by many to be the best
in the Big East.-

The rest of Wannstedt’s re-
cruits decided that the ﬁring of
the coach who recruited them,
along with the subsequent hiring
andvﬁring of Mike Haywood, was
too much turmoil for them.

Two more players are already
on campus — defensive linemen
Khaynin Mosley—Smith and Ze-
nel Demhasaj. Mosley—Smith and
Demhasaj will be able to practice
this spring with the team._

vv"

Courting contenders "L

Graham started the recruiting
process by visiting players in their
homes, then returned to Oakland
for the recruits’ official visits to
the campus. He said he visited 24
homes in two weeks.

jokingly, Graham thanked his
pilots for all the hours they spent
ﬂying him around the country.
Pitt recruited players from a va-
riety of states such as, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Texas, Washington,
D.C., New York, Ohio, Alabanfi‘
Florida and Georgia. Graham said
the coaches wanted to focus on
nationwide recruiting.

“We have a great brand, we
have a great, great tradition [at
Pitt] ,” he said. “We went to a lot of
states in the South and Pitt is very
well received. But our focus is to
win and to own Western Pennsyl-
vania and that’s something we’ve
got to work on immediately.”

The Super Bowl is more than a game.

V It’s one big social gathering. Here’s

some advice for Sunday’s festivities.

First, buy your snacks now. Inpast
years, the demand for chips, pretzels
andallofnature’s ﬁnestbite-size foods
have left the shelves of Oakland’s con-
venience stores bare by Sunday morn-
ing. A good bag of tortilla chips goes

"faster than a ﬁirnished apartment
— heat included in the rent! — this
time of year.

Whether you’re waiting for a bus
or killing class time, you need to stop
what you’re doing and run to the mar-
ket this very moment. Faster! Dodge

There’s no ﬁme!

After snacks are secured, the sec-
ond task concerns where you are going
to watch the game. Speciﬁcally, which
friend has the best television? I want
to see Hines Ward’s pores in 1080p.
If that ﬁiend is wary about hosting a
Super Bowl party, coax him with the
scarce snacks you have.

A third pregame task to tend to: ’

betting. AccordingtoBloomberg, upto

popular form of social gambling, in
which each participant is randomly

great game.” If the Steelers don’twin,
blame it on Roethlisberger. If they do
win, well, you knew it all along. You’re
right eitherway! This strategy is often

Pitts, a defensive back from Woodland
Hills, Pa., who de—~committed from Pitt
during the coaching changes. But Pitts, one
of the top prospects in’Western Pennsyl-
vania, returned to the Panthers when he
faxed his letter of intent yesterday.‘

“We thought he was one of — if not the
best — players in the area,” Graham said.
“He was a ‘must’ for us.”

Graham emphasized the qualities that
he looked for in each of his recruits.

“Our approach is that we [have a] high
octane, fast—tempo and explosive style of

football. B1ue—collar and hard-edge,” Gra— P

ham said. “These” are the characteristics
that you will ﬁnd in this class. Our main
focus from a positionvstandpoint was speed
and explosive power.”

Players have to fit

He added that he wants the Pitt program
to focus on bringing in men of character.

“Our focus in this class is ﬁrst and fore-
most character, work ethic, discipline,” he

. said. “I’m so excited about this group that

they bring a winning attitude to already a

very, very ﬁne group of men.” ~
With the departure of Dion Lewis to

the NFL, Graham found it necessary to

' Bay Packers fan.

Some Philadelphia Eagles _and Cleveland
Browns fans in the Pittsburgh area have adopted
Green Bay because theirteams lost—what else is
new?—andthey don’twantarivaltowin. Forced
puns ﬁom Steelers fans like “stairway to seven”
and “knocking on seven’s door” are obnoxious,
but don’t respond by antagonizing them. Just let
Pittsburgh fans have their fun on Sunday.

That brings up another common Super Bowl
party event: the pointless debate. As the game
rolls on and a yawner of a coach’s challenge hits
thefourth minute of review, friends are going

i to chat about football — and disagree. I’ve seen

arguments start because ﬁiends got their Mike
Williamses mixed up. Knowthatthis will happen,

‘ and try to weather the storm.

‘Haveyou everwonderedwhatwemissbecause

.. of the Super Bowl‘? I call it the Christmas Effect,
V based off the phenomenon that no actual news
. seems to happen on Christmas. Even ifanAf'rican

‘nation falls into chaos Sunday night —— like, say,

_ Eritrea —— it’ll be weeks before we realize it.

So ifyou’ve reached yourbickering quota and
your football get—together has hit a lull, check

 out the scores of other sporting events. There

aren’t many because of smart schedulers, but I
searched untillfound afew that overlap with the
big game. Mexico plays Puerto Rico in Caribbean
Series baseball at 7:30 p.m., and South American

pU2o soccerwill stream on ESPN3 all evening. Go

Colombia!
‘ Commercials will be a part of your evening
as well, as many Americans pay closer attention

, to them than they do to the game. Sometime in

the second quarter, though, you’re going to have

sive backs, his position in college at East
Central University in Ada, Okla. Pitt’s sec-
ondary was clearly a sore spot and Graham
looked to add depth to the position with
ye_sterday’s commitments. _

“The running back position was a big
focus for us and you see we signed four run-
ning backs,” Graham said. “The defensive
backs were a big focus for us as well. You
see six defensive backs that we signed.”

With the new ‘additions, the Panthers
have stocked up at these two valuable po-

sitions, and one ofthose freshman run-
ning backs could potentially get carries
next season to spell probable starter Ray
Graham. . ' ’

“All those running backs are guys that
we think have an opportunity to ﬁt in with
what we do,” Graham said. “We do a lot
of different things when it comes to the
backﬁeld.” P

Many of the younger players could make
it onto the ﬁeld to be playmakers because
of that speed and athleticism. Graham

said that with his unique football philoso-

phy — what he described as a no—huddle
football team —-— the coaching staff wasn’t
concerned about rankings. They wanted
to ﬁnd players that ﬁt the philosophy and
approach Pitt will bring to the ﬁeld neg.
season.

“I’m excited. I can’t wait,” Graham
said. “Our staff can’t wait to get started.
I think [the fans] are going to be really,
really pleased with the product we put on
the ﬁeld.” I A

SMOKER? Are you
NOT regularly exer-
cising?. Smokers 18-39
who smoke at least 10
cigarettes per day are
needed for a research
study. Smokers will
stay overnight in the
lab for 11 nights on 4

separate occasions.
They must abstain
from smoking for

72hrs. on 3 occasions.
To determine eligibil-
ity, you will complete a
comprehensive inter-
view, blood tests, drug
tests, and an overnight
sleep assessment. Earn
up to $1225 for com-
pleting the entire study.
This is not a smoking
cessation study—it is not
intended to help you
quit. For more informa-
tion call 412-246-5911.
