National CORE Leader
Expounds On Equality
At Regional Conference

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

“The main point I want to make here today,” said Floyd
B. McKissick, national director of Congress of Racial Equal-
ity (CORE), is that the blacks have decided to determine
what they want to do and when they want to do it.”

McKissick delivered the keynote address at the East
Central Regional Organization (ECRO) conference last Fri-

day.

“The first thing we want is choice equality,” said Mc-

Kissick. “We were forced to c-ome to this country as slaves,
and w-e can’t forget the past,” he added. He also said that a
certain degree of integration is necessary for the Negro

to get power to make choices.

McKissick went on to say that
our society has a highly pub-
licized false assumption that “all
black folks want is integration,
that we want to be white. We
don’t want to be white and we’re
not trying to be white,” he de-
clared.

“If you’re going to deal with
the black man today you’ve got
to respect his thinking as dif-
ferent from yours,” McKissick
said. “If We don't own property
ourselves, how can you expect
us to respect white men’s prop-
erty?”

McKissick also spoke about
control of power for “black cul-
ture.”“ Black consumers spend
$30 billion a year, and what do
we get get for our money? In-
ferior -schools and housing, with
the situation getting progres-
sively worse,” he stated.

“The blacks have to quit try-
ing to integrate banks and es-

tablish their own instead,” he '

said. “Money makes money, and
if we’re spending the money we
know we'll get jobs and city
management.”

McKissick spoke of other prob-
lems facing the Negro today.
“Our society has ‘become so ra-

‘ cist,” he declared, “that la black

man must ﬁght being ‘black as
well as his poverty before he
can begin to live his life.

“Jobs «are not the answer,” he
noted. “The blacks must move
for control of cities, and try to
develop 'a parallel society our-
clared.

"McKissick also pointed out
that “the blacks have had to de-
velop defensive tactics to get

i along in this world.” He told the

delegates that “I found out I
was black before I found out I
was American.

“I’m a violent man because
I’Ve been taught by white folks
to be violent,” McKissick con-
fessed. “But then even God is
violent,” he added.

Father Groppi Tells Clergy
To Get Involved or Get Out

by MYLES SAUNDERS

Father James Groppi, the
militant Milwaukee civil
rights worker pursuled fur-
ther the course of militancy
in a speech given Saturday
to the state conference of
the NAACP. Speaking to t-he
joint meeting of youths and
adults at the Hilton Hotel,_ Fa-
ther Groppi insisted on “direct
action” in civil rights. “We can’t
wait for the white power struc-
ture,” Father Gropipi said. “Don’t
bother with moral persuasion.
You make the man with money

scream and he’ll make the politi-
cians listen.”

Father Groppi voiced the im-
patience of the Negro. “'Ilhe
black man has been here for
400 years and the constitution
has never been :a reality.” He
was outraged at the prospect of
white foreigners coming to
America and immediately re-
ceiving the liberty that Negroes
have never received.

Moreover, Father ~G.r'opvpi feels
that in Milwaukee the Negroes
have been receiving a “double
standard” ‘of justice. Marches
have been made illegal in Mil-
waukee. This is, in effect, tak-

Student - Faculty Seminar Studies
The Effects of Alienation In Society

by FAN GLICKSMAN

The Student-Faculty-Seminar held its fourth discus-
sion last Thursday evening. Speaking in the panel debate
were Dr. Warren T. Hill, director of the University Counsel-
ing Center; James Malloy, assistant professor of political
science; Howard Stein, graduatestudent in anthropology;
and Victor Willem, undergraduate student majoring in
economics. Mrs. Priscilla Alvarado, undergraduate student
in Spanish, participated as moderator.

The Seminar was begun a
year ago by faculty members
concerned with a closer rela-
tionship with students.

Dr. Hill, speaking as an opti-
mist «asserted that “man must
open his eyes and stand alone to

University Students Killed
In Automobile Accident

CI‘_h_rec University students were
killed and three others injured
in an auto accident Saturday.
Their car veered off the Atlan-
tic City Expressway, rolled down

an embankment, and hit a tree.

Patricia Pirlo, 20, of 893 Stan-
baugh Ave., Sharon, Pa., and
Bruce Prince, 20, of Pottstown,
Pa., were dead when rescuers
reached the wreck.

Cyrus Hermann, 19, of Res A

 

elle, Ill., died on route to the At-
lantic City Hospital.

Two students were admitted
to the hospital with head in-
juries. They are Joan Kaplan,
20, of Philadelphia, who is in
critical condition, and Raymond
Ponzine, Jr., 21, of Elizabeth,
N. J., reported in serious con-
dition.

Michael Goldstein, 20, of Man-
hasset, N. Y., the driver of the
car sustained only mild injuries.

   

 

-attain satisfaction and a feel-
ing of relatedness to the world
about him.”

Victor Willem, claiming to be
an anarchist, said that “people
risk only when they are sure of
success. We are involved with a
society of failures where no
one wants responsibility. We
commit ourselves to a philoso-
phy and let it guide us.” Willem
felt that people are afraid to be
individuals and risk the security

of being identiﬁed with a. speci-

ﬁc group or philosophy.

Malloy, somewhat the realist of
the discussion, used the case of
free speech at Berkely as an ex-
ample. The students were rebel-
ling not for free speech, he
claimed, “but because of aliena-
tion, loneliness and a lack of

 

warmth.” These deviants were
the real situation, rather, than
freedom of speech. He felt that
“these psychological problems
could be dealt with through
therapy.”

He continued to discuss a ques-
tion of power at two levels. Who
will have the power to control
the University? “’I‘.he University
is critical because it provides
knowledge and the trained peo-
ple to provide it. The degree and
level of education today has the
power of creating a class. prob-
lem.” I

Howard Stein, viewing the dis-
cussion from a philosophical
point of view, felt that “we have
repudiated responsibility. We
have converted people, as well
as our enviromnent, into ma-
chines. There is a necessity of
the self to grow in its own
Solitude.”

However, this «argument did
not satisfy the other speakers,
who continued to point out that
when a problem arises, the solu-
tion isn't just to “try harder,"
but to attack the causes of the
Problem.”

work with-. .

ing away the power of protest,
the Catholic priest remonstrated.
He said that they tell the pro-
tester to use non-violence, which
means demonstration. “When
they take that away, we have
nothing left but militancy.” This
leads to .t'he attitude in Milwau-

' kee of “Black Power, .basby——.go

to it. We’ve had -it. Nothing else
has worked.”

Father Groppi, closely sur-
rounded by three members of
Milwaukee's _“Commandos”
spoke at a news conference
against dissention on the
grounds that nﬁlitancy and cler-
gy do not mix. Further, he be-
came hostile toward those cler-
gymen that did not get involved
in social change. “Too often re-
ligion is irrelevant,” he said.
“Stop talking about ‘pie in the
sky’ and ‘life after death’ and
start talking about how you get
there.”

Groppi justiﬁed his stand on
militancy by saying that “Jesus
Christ was a revolutionary.” I
go to the church, he said, to get
the strength from Christ to “go
out and change the world." Fin-
ally, he said, all members of the
clergy must get involved in so-
cial change, “otherwise they
ought to get out.” .

Groppi appealed to all men to
“get involved” -not just the cler-
gy. ’Ilh-e black man must be
helped, not because he is black,
but because he is the white
man's brother. Groppi contin-
ued, “Anyone who is a man
must be involved, ct-herw-ise they
become animals.”

Probably the most impending
aspect of the situation in Mil-
waukee is the resolve of the
black people to achieve certain
ends, i.e. open housing and de-
segregation of schools and school
busing. Father Groppi spoke of

an instance which illustrates A

this.” One night during a march
in Milwaukee, a member of the
“Commandos” was found cry-
ing in a church. He said to Fa.-
ther Groppi, “I’ve got to be out
there. I don't ‘care if I die.”
hTat white men have all the
guns seems to be of little. im-
portance, for the black man is
willing to die for his cause.
There has ‘been some progress
in M-ilvvlaukee. Where hitherto-
fore all the movement has suc-
ceeded was in havrin-g their pic-
ture taken «by the police, it has
now seen the courts rule against
several “slum lords.” But Fa-
rther Groppi will not begin to

succeed until there is a law on -.

-he puts it, the Negro veteran of
Vietnam to come home and live
in the house of his choice.

‘Pitt News’ Review

‘Accident’ Offers View of England

by PAUL ANDERSON
Accident begins with a
lingering shot of an attrac-
tive, red—bricked country
house slumbering in the ear-

ly morning moonlight. Bay-,

ing hounds and sighing
nightbirds work to change
the innocent quiet into an
oppressive freboding si-
lence. Screechin g tires and break-
ing glass soon ﬁll our ex1pe»c-
rtant ears‘ with the sounds of an
automobile accident.

A black Bentley lies smoking
on its ‘side as the owner of the
modest estate, an Oxford pro-
fessor, played by Dirk Bogarde,
pulls a very pretty pupil (Jac-
queline Sassard) from the
steamy wreck. Her long-haired
passenger, Michael-York, also a
stud-ent at Oxford, previously
very drunk, now lies very dead
against the side door of the car,
his neck broken. Blood from a
gaping wound on the side of
his head oozes through his blond
hair as Anna digs her heel into
his lifeless cheek to push her-
self through the car window.

Accident i-s about a couple of
cheeky heels in hot pursuit of
a comely young coed. It’s the
eternal triangle story with com-
plications: an additional angle.
It's a rectangular traps that en-
shares four victims (accident-
ly?) within its square girth.
Pretty Anna is attracted to her
philosophy professor, shy Stev-
en, who is unable to accept her
loveapple because he  mar-
ried (unharppily, of course). So
Anna dates young William, a
philosophy enthusiast of sorts,
to try and keep it in the depart-
ment but sleeps with Charlie

(Stanley Baker), an obnoxious
buffon in (of all the nerve!)
Ste~ven’s own house.

Later, Anna unexpectedly re-
veals to Steven her plans to mar-
ry William who is then killed
in the accident on the way to
Sleven’s house. Because Anna
had been driving without a. li-
cense, Steven hides the shocked
girl in his house until after the
police leave, then attempts to
bring his pupil to her senses
through repeated applications of
his person to hers. The next
morning, Anna decides to reject
Charlie Who, unaware of her
wedding plans, still believes she
loves him. She quits Oxord and
returns home. -Steven also re-
turns home and the ﬁlm ends
with another shot of the house,
this time with the professor and
his two children sporting in the
driveway, oblivious to the sound
of a speeding automobile’s loud
crash. The audience can hear
the wreck but they can’t see it.

Accident runs deep. Almost
too deep, in places, to fathom.
Although the director's (Joseph
Losey) ability to photographical-
ly ﬁll in the blanks -between the
sparse dialogue is ixrrpressive,
his vru-de ﬂashbacks often de-
mand the viewer’s close -atten-
tion. Something like this must
be expected of a “deep” ﬁlm so,
if the older movie-goers simply
save their "aside comments -and
the younger viewers, their goo-
goo eyes, for after the show,
everyone should be able to piece
the ﬁlm together.

Dirk Bogarde aptly ﬁlls the
shoes of a mis-matched middle-
aged man who would love to
try anything if he only had the"
opportunity, enough to drink

and the muscletonne. Stanley
Bake-r’s portrayal of the yuk-
yuk loser type who bounces ten-
nis balls off girls behinds and
laughs -about it for 15 minutes
is notworthy but Ja.cqueline Sas-
sard’s, of the cool young thing
to whom everything happens,
isn’t Michael York plays a very
professional -dead. for a lad his
age but, unfortunately, is rather
amateurish about looking alive.

Because it is «set in English
countryside and shot in color,
Accident is a ﬁlm that could just
lie around looking beautiful for

the rest of its life. Picturesque
scenes of an Oxfordian campus,
golden ﬁelds and sunlit wood-
lands could almost hang by
themselves as carefully compos-
ed works of art.

So Accident’s not just for
heavy—hand~ed thinkers. It could-
n't be as thick as that. People
who don’t like ﬁlms with only
three jokes in them should go to
see it anyway because it's beau-
tiful and from England and be-
cause the Shadyside Theatre has
seats that move backwards and
forwards.

Page 4 — THE PIT!‘ NEWS — Monday, October 30, 1967

An Unfavorable

Last week’s Student Government (SG) meeting centered around a
discussion concerning possible affiliation with the National Student Asso-
ciation (NSA). No direct action was taken on whether or not to affiliate
with NSA at that time, bmt several points were‘. brought up in the course
of the discussion that require further examination.

One -argument made to illustrate NSA’s lack of responsibility con-
cerned an NSA newsletter which made false statement concerning our
Chancellor’s policy in regard to submitted names to the House On Un-
American Activities Committee (HUAC). We pursued the charges made
concerning NSA’s incorrect reporting -of the news and found them to be

 true, as witness the following; “Last week the president of the University

announced that he would be sending membership lists of student organiza-
tions to HUAC” (January, 1967, NSA newsletter). Another statement that
appeared in the same newsletter was the following; “At the University
-of Pittsburgh, students have planned a mass rally on February 1 in pro-
test of HUAC and the administraﬁion’s policy of cooperation.”

Both of these statements ‘have no factual basis whatsoever and can
only be termed distortions of the truth. Our then Acting Chancellor David
H. Kurtzmlan never announced he would be sending membership lists of
student vorganizationsv to HUAC. In fact, no organizations are required to
submit membership lists to any University administrator. Also, no “mass
rally” was ever held last February.

This is but one incidence concerning our University and NSA, but

First Impression

we m.ust remember that we were not even affiliated with NSA at the time
_these remarks appeared in the NSA Newsletter. We do not know who NSA’s
University sources may be, but we do know they are completely inaccurate
and unfair to the parties involved.

 

Because of the initial exposure to NSA’s sensational cuechniques,

we must seriously decide what are the benefits favoring affiliating with
NSA and would they outweigh the unfavorable impression of irresponsi-
bility created by these articles? Unless NSA can provide definite services
that will assist our University’s student programs, why should we affiliate
with that organization?

National organizations of this nature have only so much manpower
and resources available to the participating chapters. We recognize that
NSA. is limited in this respect. However, we also are aware that organiza-
tions such as NSA are run by a group of individuals whose stands on key
issues can often run counter to stands approved by our own student body,
such as the black power resolution passed at the last national congress
implicitly condoning possible violence. .

It appears to us that the political implications of affiliating with
NSA should be thoroughly evaluated and properly weighed. _We also should
ﬁind out exactly what services will be provided to_us by affiliating with
NSA. If these services can improve our student programs, we should then
consider NSA membership. If not, we cannot ignore the actions cited about
NSA’s past record. Regardless, no decision about affiliating should be

 

   

Hippies vs. Birchers

A Splintering America

Look around you. Some-

'thing is happening. Look at

the Hippies and the Dig-
gers, the Black Muslims, the
Hell’s Angels, the John
Bi‘rch Society and the SIt)S
. ts, _ r a Democra ic
§§ti%l?l: its in was me
restless, and nobody‘ is do-
ing anything about it.
America seems to be splin-
tering itself into bitter lit-
tle pressure groups, each
with its own “thing,” each
with its own View of the
world and how to run it.
The Hippies tell us to love
everybody, the Hell’s An-
gels, to hate everybody, the
John Birch Society to sus-
pect everybody. If Jesus
were alive and kicking, and
told us in our various groups
to do things like turn the
other cheek, he would in
turn be considered a Com-

mie, a fink, or a member of T

the Establishment. For
those Americans who still
go to Church, he’s living on
his reputation.

It would be nice to laugh

I it all off as just something

that will come and go, and
not something to get at all
worried about. But the fact
that so many people seem
to see so much wrong with
the way this country is head-
ing is an indication to me
that they are right — some-
thing is wrong.

One of the most impor-
tant needs that human be-
ings have is the need to feel

“outs,” and whose discon-
tent cannot really be blam-
ed on society But when the
underground reaches a cer-
tain proportion of the pop-
ulation. the society is “sick,”
and something must be
done. I think America is ap-
proaching that point.

The most convincing evi-
dence that this is happening
is the open antagonism be-
tween many of the sociolog-
ical groups within our cit-
ies. The riots in Chicago are
the opening shots in a pos-
sible war between the ur-
ban lower middle class and
the Negro. Anti-war demon-
onstrators have been beaten
up in cities all over the
country. And, if Washing-

ton was any indication, the ’

protesters will soon fight
back.

Germany between the
wars‘ was in a similar situ-
ation. Hers was more des-
perate than ours, of course,
but still indicative of what
could happen. Violence in
the streets is just another
indication that the Nation
no longer is able to satisfy
large groups of its citizens.
The fact that opposing

“groups arise underlines the

loss of common purpose
among all of us. Rather
than blame the Hippies or
the John Birchers or any-
one else of some sort of im-
morality, we should take a
closer look at why they feel
the way they do, and take
the steps to fix whatever is
wrong.

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Pitt News’ Citation of
Merit in the October 23, 1967,
issue of the News might well
have been bestowed on the par-

tempted to get good seats at the
game by arriving as early as 12
noon. It is an old complaint,
agreed -but a ejustiﬁable one.
Since seats in the student sec-
tion are on a first-come basis, it
is aggrava‘-ting to see the best
seats vacant -but “reserved” as
early as two hours before game
time.

If these groups want “reserv-

they could purchase a special
section for their use. As it
stands now, all students pay the
same fee for the privilege of
sitting in the student section.
With increasing enrollment, the
number of seats available to
students gets scarce, wlhile whole
sections in the stadium remain

example, this past week (Oct.

‘Y’ Director Watanabe
Has Unusual History

by R. A. DOWNEY

Frank Watanabe, execu-
tive head of the YMCA at
the University brings to the
Y an unusual background.

Watanabe was born and
raised llll Seattle, Wash. He
attended the University of
Washington until his educa-
tion was interrupted by World

War II. Of Japanese ancestry,
he was “evacuated” to a “relo-

cation center” in Idaho-, where

he spent several month-s. He re-
sumed his education at Syra-
cuse University and took his
B.A. there in journalism, spe-
cializing in advertising.

After graduation he took a
job with an advertising ﬁrm in
New York City, where he did
mostly layout work in the year
he spent there. He was then
drafted into the Army and spent
the ﬁrst year in Texas with an

v infantry unit. He then attended

an Army intelligence language‘
school and -spent his last eight
months of service as an inter-
preter vwith the Occupation
Army in Japan.

Upon separation, Watanabe be-
gan a three year graduate pro-
gram at Yale in religion and
higher education. His first job
after completion of his graduate
studies was with the Campus
YMCA at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley. He later held
positions with the same organiz-
ation ,at the University of Min-

al Research Association, an or-
ganization geared towards the
improvement of instruction in
the state, will meet at the 
versity on Nov. 2 and 3.

The Learning Research and
Development Center (LRDC)
and the School of Education will
host the meeting.

Beginning at 2:30 p.m. on
Thursday, LRDC personnel will
explain \ -center programs and
conduct a tour of la-bonaltories
and ‘facilities. Learning (labora-
tory studies, the project' is in:

. dividuallly prescribed instruction,

instruction will be highlighted.
Representatives of the three
regional education laboratories.

‘ serving Pennsylvania will dis-

cuss their programs at the
Thursday evening session. These
laboratories receive operating
funds from the US Office of
Education.

The a-ssociat-ion’s Friday meet-
ings will include research re-
ports on curriculum evaluation
and research, training of re-
search personnel, current re-
search on reading, computer-as
sisted instruction, and the Hu-

man Energy Research Labora-

tory at the University.

Area educators are invited to
attend the meetings. More in-
for-mation can be obtained from
the conference coordinators, Dr.
Donald Cleland and Dr. D. M.

ncsota, and at Ohio State Uni-
versity. In 1965, he joined the
YMCA at the University.

Watan-abe says he decided to
work for the YMCA because it
gave him a chance to “work di-
Iectly with people rather than
indirectly through other media.”
He remarked that the emphasis
of the Y here is on community
and social service. Students are
exposed to leadership situations
in working with blind children,
juvenile delinquents, urban poor
and in other social situations.

Service to others, according to
Watan-abe, is -important not only
because it aids the person being
served, but also because it en-
ables the person doing the serv-
ice to become conscious of his
own motives and desires. It is
also important to the person
serving to be able to “articu-
late ‘his reasons for serving.”

Watanabe feels that “students
these days have a great deal to
say about «improving society,
and one of the exciting ways -in
which they can express these
feelings and opinions is through
involvement in a -program like
that of the YMCA.”

BROOKLYN, N. Y. (CPS) —
On a partition in one of the
men’s rooms at Long Island
University’s (LIU) Brooklyn
Center is lettered, in bold char-
acters, the following:

THIS STALL FOR SALE TO
CCYN FOR $99.95

A curious legend, considering
the subjects that usually occu-
py wall space in collegiate men's
rooms, but at the Brooklyn Cen-

ter it makes sense—the Center .
is about to be sold, lock, stock A

and bathrooms, to the City Uni-
versity of New York (CUNY, of
which City College~—CCNY—is
one part).

The students are sore about
the pro-posed sale, but then so,

too, are the faculty and «the ad. .

ministration, and the alumni.
Twoiweeks ago 4,000 of them,
mainly students and faculty,
marched across the Brooklyn
Bridge——ﬁve'abreast, across the
center walk-Way —— and on to
New York’s City Hall in Man-,
hattan to show the city go-vern-
ment how they felt about it.

It was almost certainly the
largest demonstration, by a sin-,
gle college — relative to the size
of that college—-in US -history.
(The student body numbers 7,-
500.) And its inﬂuence on plans
for the sale, it appears now, has
been next to none.

Few students and faculty op-
pose the sale per set. In fact, if
the sale were planned as sim-
ply a change of ownership for
the institution, most of them
would support it, because being
part of _a public system has ad-
vantages. Faculty salaries with-
in CUNY are higher than those
within. LIU, CUNY charges no
tuition to New York residents
(tuition at LIU is over $800 per
-semester), and CUNY’s admin-
istration does not carry the stig-
ma of being bumbling and op-
pressive, which is the way the
LIU administration is regarded
by many Centerites.

The problem is that CUNY
wants the Center for its own
purposes, which means that the
Center will -simply come to an
end as an institution within the
next two years. No applications
are being accepted for next
year's freshmen class.

~Originally LIU Chancellor R.
Gordon Hoxie said that the Cen-
ter would remain part of LIU
until 1969, after which some of
the students and faculty would
go to other LIU campuses, while
some students will be absorbed
into the City system. At a pub-
lic hearing held by the state leg-
islature’s Joint Committee on
Higher Education, Hoxie extend-
ed the time limit to 1971, but
the CUNY chancellor refused to

affirm that date.

Evidently the city still wants
the use of the Center by 1969,
which leaves the future of the
freshmen, sophomores and un-
tenured members of the faculty
now at the Center somewhat up
in the air. Meanwhile, Hoxie has
said the sale will take place with-
in a month.

The Brooklyn Center, in re-
cent years, has been a kind of
odd-campus-out in the Long Is-
land University system. Al-
though the original site of Long
Island University, it is physical-
ly unimpressive compared with
the two other campuses in the
LIU system. C. W. Post and
Southampton Colleges’ situated
out in the Long Island «country-
side, are open and -modern, pleas-
ant places.

The Center, on the other hand,
is unmistakably a city institu-
tion. Situated on a postage stamp
of land in a rundown section of
Brooklyn, it comprises a hand-
full of buildings and a hemmed-
in, fenced-in grass ﬁeld where
baseball and soccer are played.
The school’s -main structure is a
converted movie theater with an
office tower attached. Inside it

er are covered with carpets of
a rich red, but the carpets, in-
evitably, are heavily worn. The
gym ﬂoor is inside the theater,
between the stage and the seats,
so that the backboards are sus-
pended against a background of
opulent stone-work surrounding
the elevated box seats.

The Center’s academic stan-
dards are not as high as, for
example, those at CCNY. Stu-
dents and faculty readily admit
to this, and many regard it as
part of the school’s value.

“We serve a clientele that can’t
meet the entrance standards of
a place like City College,” says
Prof. Thomas Stirton, chairman
of the history department. “I be-
lieve there’s a need for an in-
stitution like this in the city—
many of our people go on and
do very well.”

Stirton would like to see the

C-enter to become part of the
city or state system, but remain
essentially the same institution.

Academic considerations aside,
however, the student body has a
degree of cohesion remarkable
on a city -campus. Part of the
reason for it is a general feel-
ing that the Center has been
short-changed by the LIU ad-

, ministration. Students will offer

CCNY Buys Brooklyn Center 

a variety of charges in support
of this view, but there is one
big one—the charge that money
has gone out from the Brooklyn
Center to support the other two
campuses.

According to Jerry Rosen-
swaik-e, editor of the campus
newspaper, Clhancellor Hoxie has
denied the charge on some oc-
casions and on others admitted
it, but with the assurance that
all the money had been paid
back The latter was the posi-
tion the chancellor took at‘ the
hearing Tuesday But Rosen-
swaike, and Centerites generall-
ly, are convinced that large
sums of money have left the
campus and have not been paid
back.

The ill will ‘between the Brook-

lyn Center and the LIU 'admin- V

istration boiled over last spring,
when Hoxie ﬁred Center Pro-
vost William /Birenbaum, the
popular head of the Brooklyn
campus. A strike thast lasted
eight school days was held. It
was successful in disruzpting the
Center’s operation, but, predict-
ialbly, -led -to the formation -of
seven committees and very lit-
tl-e else. Perhaps its most sig-
niﬁcant lasting effect was to
focus student animosity on

Hoxie (the most popular button
during the strike was one that
read “Huck Foxie”).

When Hoxie announced in late
September that negotiations for
the sale were underway, most
students assumed he was re-
taliating against the Center for
last spring's strike, Harry Stein-
berg, feature editor of the cam-
pus paper, found in a survey of
student opinion that most of
them felt Hoxie was trying to
rid himself of an administrative
burden.

Rosenswaike, Sirton and
others believe that the ‘strike
may have -had some inﬂuence on
the timing of this sale, but -they
do not feel the sale is I-IoxIie’s
doing.

Rosenswaike said, “Hoxie’s a

kind of la laughing-stock. He
keeps putting his foot in his
mouth. Most people ﬁgure the
Board of Trustees won't rehire
him in January, when his con-
tract runs out.”

The decision to sell was made
by the LIU Board of Trustees.
Board Chairman-elect John Mc-
Grath, a lawyer and bank pres-
ident, has said the Brooklyn
Center is costing‘ too much to
operate as a private institution.

“I want somehow to thank the student body for their sup-
port, yelling, and great backing on Saturday. I also want to
thank whoever was responsible for the color shakers. They were
great.”———coach Dave Hart.

- Navy coach Bill Elias off—handedly remarked that foot-
ball was getting to be an emotional game. He regretted that
“we have no thermometer to measure a team’s reaction to
Pitt, Notre Dame, or Army.”

Elias had just seen his Midshiipmen come alive in the
second ‘half to edge an inspired group of Pitt football play-
ers. A lot of people thought Navy shouﬂd have been inspired
from the start, considering their upset loss to William &
Mary the week before. Elias said that his team was inspir-
ed, but that “Pitt surprised us by playing good football.”

“WE SURE WANTED to win this one,” Panther de-
fensive coach Bill Neal told Elias as he congratulated him
in the visitor’s dressing room. Ellias asked ex-Navy assist-
ant Neal how he was feeling, and Neal answered “not too
well right now.”

After Gary Cramer’s picture play sweep and cutback,
the Pitt student body wanted to beat Navy as much as the
players and the coaches. Hart was upset when he learned
that an usher closed a gate and refused to allow students to
form a tunnel on the field for the start of the second half.

It might be stretching a point, but it’s possible that
Navy’s improved play in the second half could be attributed
to the tunnel that the Mlidshipmen were allowed to stretch
for half the length of the field.

ELIAS PREDICTED “Pitt will be all right from here
on in.” He repeated, “they played good football today.”

Neal told Terry Hoover and Art Alois, who were late in
leaving the locker room, to “stick with it,” and “not lose it.”
The Panthers learned that they could beat another team,

even a team as quick as Navy.

his arm and asked, “You know how I got this? I beat my
man. I beat him so badly it hurt me.”

Elias wasnt’ disappointed with the way Navy played.
“You can’t be disappointed when you win,” he quipped.

PITT PLAYED “an amazin’ game” as Casey Stengel
would have called it. Eight sophomores, confused a little at
the start, pulled together on offense. The defense played
with an offensive center, Dave Magyar at middle linebacker
for most of the game.

And who knows? Maybe a tiginel for the players would
have have added six inches to Joe Curtinis rea.ch and Navy’s
game-winning field goal would have been blocked.

 

THREE -PANTHER DEFENDERS, Paul Killian
 (30), George Richards (42). and Lou P8-ITO“
(35), converged to stop Navy’s Dan Pike. Pike,

 

not listed on the Navy roster, averaged six yards

Navy needed only four

ther dream at the Stadium
Saturday.

With 4:01 remaining, the Pan-
thers led by two points, 3. mar-
gin which carried the hopes of
and prayers of 19,000 fans. But
John Church kicked a 32 yard
ﬁeld goal for Navy, downing
the Panthers, 22-21, with 3:57
left, and shattered everything.

“They led for four minutes,”
said Dave Hart in «a voice weak

from shouting. He -had‘ collapsed

sistant coach. But, Hart looked
well in ‘the locker room, that is,
except for losing. It was in the
locker room where Hart dealt
in superlatives when asked about
the team's ﬁfth «loss this year.

“It was a. tremendous effort;
by far, our best,” he said faintly.
“It was the best they could
give,” citing the players’ efforts.

“There’s «been a awful lot of
bad things said about them this
week, and I guess they just
found some pride, -that's all,” he
continued.

“But it was still 22-21,” grum-
bled Hart.

talented quarterback John Cart-
wright to -score. “He hurts us
more than Gary Began,” com-
mented Hart, “of course, Beban
has more tools to work with.”

Although .Hart pointed out
that Cartwright, and Navy’s two
big receivers, Rob Taylor and
Terry Murray, had played to-
gether for three years, he was
quick to criticize the Panther
pa-ss protection. “I don't know if
it was our pass rush, or our
pass coverage, but one of them
hurt us,” he said.

“I though our defensive rush
from end was poor. You just
can“. give John Cartwright a
chance,” Hart added. “And
sometimes he had as much as
five seconds to -throw.”

Many Navy formations had.

three receivers on one side, but
Hart indicated, they had done
that all year. “But Taylor con-
tinued to ﬁnd open seams when
he was covered. He just kept
running around. And Cartwright
knows he’ll be in the open.”
Yet, -the slack on defense was
not noticeabile until Ch~»urcvh’s kick
decided the contest. Throughout
the game, the Panthers had out-
played the Midshipmen.
Offensivexly, the leaders were
quarterback Jeﬁ Barr and tail-
back Gary Cramer. Sophomore
Barr started and ﬁnished his
first college game. “Barr missed
a few things. He missed receiv-
ers. He missed fakes on bootleg
situations,” cniticized Hart.
Barr completed seven of 14
passes and scored two touch-

downs, but his biggest asset was

Oramer rushed for 139 net
yards. He picked up 59 of them
early in the ﬁrst quarter when
he rounded left end, ran along

the sidelines, veered to midﬁeld, i

and scored. Although Cramer is
not a sprinter, he did use his
blockers, and displayed ﬁne
broken ﬁeld running albility.

C1-.amer’s run surpassed by 40
yards the longest previous run
from scrimmage for the Han-
thers, and it marked the first
time since the second game

against Duke -in 1966, the Pan-
thers scored rﬁrst in a football
game.

It also provided inspiration for
the many disappointed and dis-
illusioned fans who wiaznt the
Panthers to Win in the worst

way.

 Cramer’ s Switch to Tailback
Nearly Sinks N acvy Defense

by ROY JACOBS
Maybe it was Confucius who said that
a change of scenery can make a world of
difference; but whoever it was, he sure

was right.

As a fullback, in the ﬁve games before Sat-
urday's tilt against Navy, Gary Cnamer carried
the ball a total of just 16 times for 53 yards.
For the Middies, Cramer was shifted to tailback
with Jeff Brown inserted at fullback. The new
surroundings apparently did the trick, because
Cram-er did yeoman’s work against Navy, carry-
ing the ball 21 times for 139 yards.

Neither the position nor the large amount
o-f yard-age gained are newpto Cramer, who star-
red at tailback for Belle Vernon High School,
but afterwards he was deservedly satisﬁed with
his performance.

“In high school I did it more than once,” said
Gary about his 100 yard-plus rushing yardage.
“But it’s really something doing it here for the
first time.

“I was just getting used to playing fullback,
but I liked playing tailback,” reﬂected Cramer.
“It doesn’t rmatter—mI’ll play either one. I played»
tai-lback in high school so I guess I do feel more
comfortable there.”

At iﬁve-ten and 190 pounds, Cramer was a bit
misplayed at fullback, where his primary re-
sponsibilities were pass blocking and lead block-
ing for -the tailback. Try to picture him blocking
six-seven, 220 Ted Hendricks of M-iam-.i.

It isn’t the kind of picture anyone enjoys
watching, and so, Cramer was switched to tail-
back. And the offense, particularly the ground

Shimpeno’s Three Goals Lead

Soccer Team

by DAVE TIERNAN.

To First Win

It was a cold Saturday morning, but Dave Shimpeno
was hot as he led the booters to their first Win of the sea-

.-son, 3-0, over Bucknell. Shimpeno supplied all three goals for an
oﬁense that .hadn’t been effective in previous games.

His goal came with ten min-

 

 

utes gone in the ﬁrst quarter.
Winger Pete Snyder «drilled a
pass across the center. G-ary
Foertsch kicked and missed, but
Shimpeno, who was backing up

, th-e play, slammed the ball into

the net.

i Seconds later, Bo-b Trexler
found Shimpeno and Foertsch
open and passed -across the mid-
dle. This time it was Shimpeno
who took the ﬁrs't kick on the
goal-and it was good!

Bucknell opened the second
quarter with a strong offensive
drive, but goalie Len Harmon
made two stops of hard Buck-
nell shots. Then, Blaine Popp,
who started his first game at
right fullback, stole the ball
from Bucknell offense and boot-
ed a long, high kick downﬁeld.
Shimpeno raced under the kick
and headed the ball into the net
for his third goal.

The three goal lead was all
the inspiration the team needed,
and the remainder of the game
was dominated by the bootens,
allowing coach Leo Bemis to
substitute freely in the final
quarter.

Three injuries were the only
bad result of the game that Be-
mis termed “a great team ef-
fort.” Shimpeno and l‘l‘all.fb‘8.'(,‘l{
Bob Qu-inlin left the game in the
last quarter with leg injuries,
and Joe Kruth'was helped off
the ﬁeld after banging his head
while going for a loose ball. All
three players were in good con-
dition today and are ex-pected to
be ready to go against Akron

. this week.

Spirits were high in the locker
room after the game and Bemis
was pleased with the team’s per-
formance. ‘fshlmpeno gave us

     

the shooting power we needed
and the team controlled the
game with good passes,” Bemis
said. He noted that the substi-
tutes played well and when ask-
ed about the remaining games
he commented, “With a team ef-
fort like today, we could ﬁnish
with three more Wins.”

Harmon was congratulated for
his shut-out by one of the few
fans who braved the freezing
temperature. Harmon «smiled and
said, “The shut-out doesn’t mat-
ter. We Won and that's What
counts.”

Bucknell’s coach Craig Rey-
nolds had nothing but praise for
the booters. “I was an assistant
coach at Pitt last year, and I
knew if Pitt’s offense ever jelled
they would be tough,” he said.
Then he shook his ‘head and con-
cluded, “Pitt simply out«played
us today.”

ERNIE -MOUEN and Gary Foertsch exhibit the joy of the soccer
team as they congratulate Dave Shimpeno after he scored his third
‘goal of the game. Shimpeno led the booters to a 3-0 win, their first

shot at Cramer, but missed.

game, started rolling against
Navy. The major  to the
running attack was Cra.mer’s 59
yard touchdown run which open-
ed the scoring against Navy.

“The biggest part of the run
was getting through the line,” re-
membered Cramer. “Jeff Brown
gave me a real block on the de-
fensive end. I stayed along the
sideline for about ten yards.
Then that guy missed me -and I
cut back against the ﬂow.” The
rest was a cakewalk.

The rest o-f the game Wasn't
a cakewalk for the Panthers,
though. Navy came on to win,
22-21. But all Cramer could -do
was watch.

“It's pretty hard to stop Cart-
wright, Taylor, and the rest of
them,” he offered. “I thought
the defense did a. pretty good
job. But once those guys get
started, it’s pretty hard to stop

‘them. They did run over Syra-

cuse and beat Penn State. They
just came up with the big play
when they needed it.”

Still, as they've had to do af-
ter four other weekends this
season, the Panthers have to
»'pick th_emselve»s up .from defeat
and get ready for their next
game, this time against another
Eastern power, Syracuse. It's
probably tougher to recover
from a heartbreaker, -‘but Cram-
er isn’t worried about the Pan-

‘ thers——or himself.

“I plan to keep going,” he
outlined. “But if it’s someone
else, that’s just as good. I think
we have a good chance in our
last four games. Navy was sup-
posed to be the best in the East
and we came close to them. If
we keep playing like we played,
we’ll beat someone. I know

The Panthers are hoping «Cram-
er is «as prophetic as Confucius.

failed to connect with his shot. Shimpeno, who
was alertly backing up the play, slammed the ball
into the net for his first goal of the day.

teams at Saturday’s Canisus In-
vitational added to their pres-
tige.

The varsity placed a respect-
able sixth in the ﬁeld of over
20 teams. Led by Jerry Richey
and Greg Rodgers, the freshmen
captured first place.

“I was a little disappointed
with the varsity’s performance,”
said Banner. “Jay Jensen fell in
the ﬁrst half mile while he was
in the pack,” Banner stated, “and
even thou-gh he recovered, it
hurt us badly.”

The best performance turned
in .by a varsity harrier was the
12th place ﬁnish of Paul Greig.
The competition in the race was
“real good,” according to Ban-
ner, and this helped push Greig
to a good time. Describing Greig,
Banner said, “Even though he
is not a real talented runner, he
is a hard worker and has come
a long way for us.”

Ken Lawton placed 12th, but
his performance was hindered
by a case of the ﬂu. “Roger Hol-
ly did his usual steady job, but
I was disappointed in Paul Zink.
I felt he performed poorly,” cri-
tized Banner.

The winner of the ﬁve mile
race was Harry Finely of Cana-
da’s Waterloo University. Finely

Sutherland edged the House
o-f Lords, 7-0, in Dorm League
football action Thursday. Ran-
dom won on a forfeit by Haw-
thorne, and the Peanuts Ga.‘lllecry
lost by forfeit to Litchﬁeld.

Sutherland was locked in a
scoreless battle with the House
of Lords after the ﬁrst four
quarters. In the first overtime
period, Sutherland quarterback
Bill Hull carried the ball for a
touchdown with a six yard run
around the left end. Hull then
passed to fullback Steve Ellisor
for a one-point conversion.

Four games are scheduled for
tomorrow. Pleasure Palace and
Stratford, both with two wins
and no losses, will clash in a
League “A” game. Panther
House and Mad House face each
other in a battle of unbeatens
in League “B.”

Sutherland wil=1 have a chance
fo-r revenge against Ditchﬁeld in
another League “B” game. Su-
therland, which is one-and-one
on the season, was beaten by
undefeated Litchﬁeld in an ear-
lier contest. Playboys’ Penthouse

Toronto University captured the

Banner was a little more pleas-
ed with the winning freshmen’s
performance, but he felt there
is .still plenty of room for im-
provement. “They are a. real
good squad, but they have a lot
that they haven’t used yet. They
can run much faster. They’ll get
more speed work to help lower
their times,” he said.

“Jerry Richey ran a relaxed
and easy race’ and probably
would have broken the course
record if he hadn't missed a turn
and had to run back to correct
it,” praised Banner. Richey cov-
ered the 2.8 mile course in 13
minutes, 54 seconds, four sec-
onds off the course record.

Greg Rodgers placed second,
one second behind Richey. Ac-

cording to Banner, “Greg has
tremendous potential and is just
coming into his own.”

Seventh, ninth, and tenth places
went to Mike Nolan, John Cro-
zier, and Mark Vornhagen, re-
spectively. Banner felt that No-
lan ran a good race, but should
have ﬁni-shed third behind Rich-
ey and Rodgers. “A mental lapse
at the end of the race cost him
the third spot,” Banner said.

“John (Crozier) is much bet-
ter than ninth place, and I feel
that he can run better than he
showed Saturday,” remarked
Banner. Also, he said, “Mark
Vornhagen ran his best race in
three weeks after being sick.”

As for Bill Matajasic and Jeff
Wilson, who ﬁnished 17th and
18th, Banner feels that they are
both doing good jobs and show
ﬁne potential for the future.
