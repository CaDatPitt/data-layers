Two Pitt afﬁliates who made strides
in their respective research careers
snagged the 2011 MacArthur Fel-
lows, an award that comes with a
$500,000 check. _ — . V
Elodie Ghedin, an assistant
professor in Pitt’s School of Medi-

cine, and Kevin Guskiewicz, who &

graduated from Pitt in 1992, were
two of the 22 fellowship recipients
selected nationwide this year to

receive $500,000 in unrestricted 1

support over the next ﬁveyears,
Pitt announced’Tuesday. \
“I was stunned and thought it
had to be some kind of sick joke,”
Ghedin said in an email. “I ﬁrst re-
ceived a cryptic email from a man
called Bob Gallucci asking me to
call him back ASAP. It turns out he
is the president of the [MacArthur]

Foundation and he said ‘I have the f
pleasure to inform you that you '

have been chosen as one of our fel-
lows.’ I had to sit down.” -

Recipients of the Fellowships
can use the $500,000 “to advance
their expertise, engage in bold new
work, or, if they wish, to change
ﬁelds or alter the direction of their
careers,” according to the MacAr-

thur Foundation website. It is a “no 1

strings attached award.” V

Ghedin said she will use the I

money to further her research
on viruses. Now, thepgenomics
scientist said her work focuses

on decoding the genomes of vari— '

ous pathogens, including viruses,

Kidney recipient and donor sue UPMC

A couple filed negligence lawsuits after a kidney transplant infected the patient with hepatitis C.

The recipient of a kidney infected
with hepatitis C and the original
kidney donor ﬁled negligence law-
suits against UPMC Presbyterian
hospital and University of Pitts-
burgh Physicians Tuesday. '

_ Michael Yocabet, the kidney
recipient, and Christina Mecan-
nic, the kidney donor, are suing
UPMC and UPP after an April
kidney transplant during which
doctors transplanted Mecannic’s
hepatitis C—infected kidney into
Yocabet. The two have been to-
gether for 21 years and have an

18-year-old son.

The suits were ﬁled by the
Greene County couple in the Civil
Division of the Court of Common

I Pleas ofAllegheny County in Pitts-

burgh and seeks an unspeciﬁed

. amount "of money in damages.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys, Harry

S. Cohen 82 Associates, ﬁled the

complaints. - _
The suits, each of which con-

. tain 12 counts against UPMC and

UPP, charge that UPMC and UPP

knew of the infected state of the A

kidney and allowed the procedure
to go on. ‘

“Had anybody from UPMC’s
transplant program, whether it

be a physician, nurse, coordina-
tor, technician, assistant, etc., fol-
lowed standard federal guidelines
and/or hospital police at numerous
different junctures along the way,
Ms. Mecannic’s hepatitis C test
result- would have been obvious
(it should have been ‘ﬂagged’)...”
the complaint said. A A

The counts include various acts '

of professional negligence, corpo-
rate negligence, intentional and
negligent misrepresentation and
nondisclosure and intentional and
negligent inﬂiction of emotional
distress.

UPMC released a statement de-
nying any allegations of a cover-

UP- .

“Once the error was discovered,
UPMC disclosed the information
to the patients involved and UNOS

ing],” it said.

LGBT students
should stand tall

In case you missed it, the U.S.
just made a step in the right di-
rection.

Yesterday marked the ofﬁ—
cial repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t
Tell,” the military policy that has
made it illegalfor LGBT menfand
women in the military to reveal
theirsexuality. since tVJ.9,9__3.’_.

ervielill/Iiagaliirie irepl‘orts

-that there are about 70,000 cur-

rently serving military personnel
stationed around the world who
are LGBT. To commemorate the
ofﬁcial day that they could re-
veal their true selves, many of
those men and women resorted
to social media to come out to
the world.

One 21-year-old man stationed
in Germany used YouTube to re-
cord a phone conversation where
he comes out to his father who
lives in Alabama. In the video,
his dad says it’s okay, and that
he still loves his son. In less than
24 hours, the video has gotten
more than 65,000 hits, and the
highest-ranked comments about
it are positive.

The official repeal of “Don’t
Ask, Don’t Tell” shows that we
are entering an unprecedented
period of tolerance. The medium
is the message, and the Internet
will play a huge role in the future
ofthe LGBT community.

The strongest, bravest men
and women in the country are
now allowed equal rights when
it comes to sexual expression,
and hundreds of them snatched
yesterday’s opportunity to come
out with what they’d been forced
to hide for years. A

One Marine told NPR his re-
sponse to men he served with
who had said they wouldn’t ﬁght

next to a gay Marine: “Wo_w. So
gay Marines have that much pow-
er that they can totally disarm
you and defeat you just by their
simple presence? And you call

' yourself a Marine?”

We agree. If one’s homosex-
uality offends people so much‘
that they have to make their

discomfort known, then that’s’
their problem. The repeal and
dramatic response of many in-

dividuals in the military should
set an example for LG.BT_P_itt
students. - V-

‘ For several reasons,tLlGB’T stu- I

dents might be afraid to come out
or show their affection for one
another in public. But we think

there is a home at Pitt for every-,

one. We think there’s a strong
consensus of tolerance on cam-
pus, but rarely donwe see people
in the LGBT community holding
hands in public. Why should they
feel the need to hold back?

Our time at Pitt should be a
time of self—discovery, as well as
acceptance of others. We think
these soldiers’ YouTube videos
are a sign of progress. And they
might be just enough to catalyze a
grassroots movement of support
across the country. ‘

It’s all too clear that now is the
time for change. Whether you’re
preparing for National Coming
Out Day on Oct. 11, anxious to
show affection to your partner in
public or just beginning to ﬁgure
yourself out, we think that if the
men and women in the military
who have been suppressed for al-
most 18 years can be themselves
freely, everyone else should be
able to, too.

There’s nothing wrong, weird
or disgusting about that. I

_ Like most students who live off-

After all, normal activities.like

sitting at Schenley plaza won’t

keep you occupied for an entire?

semester. . ,
Board games are always a great
way to pass the time. If you’re on

campus and happen to have a few.

friends who have yet to movesoff
campus, store a board at
their residence hall and ' play
some fun ones like “Sorry!” or
“Parcheesi” during your break.
Annoyed with your friendfor
never coming to visit your dive of
an apartment in South Oakland?
Nothing says passive-aggressive
like distracting him while‘ he’s
playing “Perfection” so that all the
pieces explode in his face before
he has the chance to ﬁt them all
in the slots. Do you have a friend
who lives inTower C or_Lothrop?
Pick up a great two—player game
like “Stratego” or chess. These
logic- and tactic—based games will
get your brain working and ready
to get back to reading that dense
philosophy chapter before your
class starts in an hour. ' .

Another way to warm up your
brain before heading back to class
is to make lists or raps about a
given topic. This brainstorming

is a sort of mental stretching that.

engage in morementally stimu-
lating activities, like studying.
Don’t feel like studying for that
statistics exam quite yet? Make
a list of the top 10 things you
would do if you won/inherited/

paper that’s due in your creative
writing class? Write a few raps to
get your inventive juices ﬂowing.

Who knows? Mac Miller and Wiz
Khalifa are both from Pittsburgh.
It’s hard to have less talent than
them — maybe you can write a
song about two random colors or
the type of shoes you’re wearing
and become famous and never

again.
And what if you actually need

_ to get work done between classes?

You can get your creative juices

. bu.bbl_ing with a change of scen-

ery. Try’ dressing up and doing
homework in a professional
school. If you’re having trouble
with your finance homework,
throwon some professional at-
tire and head to Mervis Hall. The

change of 4p,cation lan‘d?:‘e_jlft)'tl1es *
I will motivate you {to  -on»

your future andsconcentrate on
the work you have to _do_. ‘There’s
nothing? better than sitting in
Scaife Hall and thinking that you
better. startllreading that micro.-

biology textbook or you won’t be

able to attend a medical school as
nice as the one you’re working in.
Even if you don’t dress up, doing
work in graduate school build-

a bunch of loud underclassmen
whose motivation to plan which
fraternity house they want to play
beer pong at next weekend out-
weighs their desire to study for
their intro—level classes.
Turning away from time-kill-
ing activities that have a beneﬁcial

effect on your studies, a fun game

called “shadowing” is a great way
to waste _some time when you’re
stuck on campus between classes.
Get one of your friends and sit in
a populated location like Towers
lobby or the Cathedral commons.
Then choose one person to follow

for an extended period of time-

Whichever one of you gets the
closest to the person for the lon-
gest without being noticed_wins
the game. Considering how much

creeping you do on Facebook, this <

is really not that odd of an activ-
ity. It’s a fun way to become more
ninja-esque, and it’s sort of like

playing a real-life version of As-
sassin’s Creed. Plus, if the person
notices you following him, you
can explain this awesome game
and possibly make anew friend
— orget aldirty look.

Another way to eat up time be-
tween classes is by touring some
of the lesser-known buildings on
campus and exploringitheir nooks
and crannies. Most buildings are
open relatively late, so if it’s-. an
especially slow day and you’re too
lazy. to make the 15-minute walk
home, make the trektoa random
building like Eberly or the new

O’Hara Student Center. This will.

make you more knowledgeable
about the campus as a whole,

and you can impress your friends’

with your helpful knowledge that
there. are pool tables and student
lounges in O’Hara or that you can
only.go into 25 of the 27 national-
ity rooms in the Cathedral.

If you,don’t feel liketaking a

- walk to a University building, try
‘ cooking or baking ‘something at
a friend’s residence hall with the

luxury of a kitchen, like Ruskin or
Bouquet. This will put you in good
favor with your friends and give
you a nice snack to eat during the
impending lecture. In addition,
this could expand your culinary
horizons and give you a new set
of skills that could make you a
more desirableifriend or "signiﬁ-
cantcother: If “Hi, I make a great
french toast casserole. Let’s be
friends/go out sometime?” isn’t
a good ice—breaker, then I don’t
know what is. Also, sharing your
freshly baked cake in your com-
puter programming recitation
would instantly make you the
coolest person in class.

Always remember that you
don’t have to succumb to bore-

’ dom or mundane homework be-

tween classes. Feel free to use any
of these suggestions when you
get tired of people—watching in

the Cathedral or having freshmen '
swipe you in to Market Central '

—-.—- you’re bound to entertain the
people around you, as well. _I

Getting inked might harm fuu jo procts

Skylar Wilcox
Staff Writer

Nathaniel Bryant, an English
Ph.D. candidate at Pitt, often sees
ﬁrsthand the way people view tat-
toos ——- by how they act around
him once they see his inked—up
arms.

“People treat you differently,”
Bryant, also a teaching assistant,
said. “Old ladies will pass up a seat
next to you on a bus. People will
hold their purses tight when-you
walk past.”

But Bryant could be considered
lucky; highly visible tattoos can
close doors for job seekers and
those looking for promotions.
Others might be ﬁred when the
dress code at a company chang-
es. *

Certain industries, like bank-
ing and food service, lean toward
conservativism in their tattoo
policies, said Barbara Juliussen,
assistant director of the Career
Development and Placement As-
sistance Office.

Some employers see these tat-
toos as signs that an individual is
impulsive and may not maintain

a professional appearance, said
Juliussen. Whether or not a busi-
ness can j ustify ﬁring an employee
based on their appearance has
been contested in the courtroom.
Several court cases have weighed
the alleged damage to a company’s
image against the religious free-
doms of employees.

Sites like the Modiﬁed Mind
Employment Line provide guide-
lines for such companies in a vari-
ety of industries. There are more
lenient standards found in “Infor-
mation Technology and Telecom-
munications industries —— places
where there is no face time with
customers,” Juliiissen "said.

The concern over how tat-
toos affect a business’s image is
driven both by customers and
management, she said. “There
are all kinds of stereotypes that
the generation in management
have about tattoos. As more of
the younger generation moves up,
this will all change.”

Bryant has also noticed the
generation gap. “My mom jok-
ingly said that if I ever came home
with a tattoo, I’d get kicked out of
the house,” he said. “When she
was growing up, tattoos had all

these residual meanings. The only
people who got tattoos were sail-
ors and hobos.”

But now, Bryant says he sees
an increasing number of his peers
with tattoos. Indeed, the Pew Re-
search Center reports that over
a third of 18-29 year olds have
tattoos. Still, Bryant is aware that
tattoos can offend some.

In his TA review surveys, he
includes the question,i“Is there
anything in the course that dis-
tracted you from learning 
including my tattoos?” Bryant,
whose tattoos cover much of his
arms but stop halfway up his fore-

’ arms, said that he has neverheard

a negative comment about his ink.
“Instead, students have told me
that it made them feel more com-
fortable, more at ease.”

Despite this feedback, Bryant
said he would “absolutely never
get” a tattoo below his sleeve line
or on his neck. “The academic job
market is especially rough. If you
get a job somewhere, you take it.”
If he was offered a position at a
school with a-conservative dress
code, “I would take the job and

Career Fair to offer 20t)\en1ployers

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬁ' Writer

The job market might be dismal,
but students’ chances of earning
that ﬁrst job or internship might
be a little bit easier if they attend
the Career Fair this year.

The Career Fair will be held
at the Petersen Events Center on
Sept. 28 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and
will host more than 250 compa-
nies, internship hosts and gradu-
ate s_ch_ools. , I  . ,_  _i_. .   

ll Pitt students and alumni
can attend the fair. Attendees can
expect more than 200 employers
and 60 new employers this year,

‘said Monica Valera, special events

and marketing coordinator for the ’

Office of Student Employment 8:
Placement Assistance.

Valera recommended that stu-
dents and alumni pre-register to
see the complete list of employ-
ers at the Career Fair in order to
research the employers and tailor
their resumes accordingly.

The link is on m¥,pig,gd!! page

under the My Resources Tab. The

ﬁrst tab is “Career Fair — Office of
Student Employment,” and from
there, students will be brought to
the Fall 2011 Career Fair page. On
the left side of the Web page under

“Welcome” is “Register.” Students _

can ﬁll out their personal informa-
tion on this page.

There won’t just be intern-
ships and full-time and part-time
employment opportunities for
students and alumni. Fifty gradu-
ate and professional schools will
also be present. These schools

. have...conL1e ‘.‘.f.r9.rn .al1..a9r.o,s§...th§ _,

country to discuss admission ‘re-
quirements and their programs,”
Valera said. '

Senior Lindsay Miller said she .

will go to the career fair if it works
with her schedule. She said she
has never been to the career fair
before.

“I heard it is a really valuable
opportunity for students,” Miller
said.

Miller, who is applying to grad
school, said she would like to ex-
plore the graduate schools that
will be there and any sort of job
opportunities that “jump out.”

   

The Fall Career Fair often has
a large turnout. Valera said more
than 3,000 students attend each
year.

“Students should go to the fair
to learn about the many types of
opportunities available to them
after graduation,” Valera said.
“They should also go to network
with employers.” ‘

Valera also advises underclass-
men to attend to learn about pos-
sible jobs after graduation.

“First Year Mentors will be

..-available during the fair §°.-giYe 
freshmen and interested sopho-

mores a tour, speak to a few em-
ployers on ways to prepare forthe
fair and to get them comfortable
with introducing them to employ-
ers during the fair,” Valera said.
To prepare for the fair, Valera
advised students and alumni to
have their resume reviewed and
to bring multiple copies, practice
their “elevator speech”, which is
typically a 30 second speech where
students should be able to sum-
marize their work experience and
why they are the best candidate for
the job, and dress professionally.

Once you reach the point at which
your rejection letters have started
arriving before you can even ﬁn-
ish your applications, it’s time for a
change. Our foolproof two-question
test will help you determine where
to go from here.

Question 1: Do you enjoy sleeping
late, not paying rent and investing
untold hours in your Madden 2012
dynasty? .' --

‘ If yes, move home with your
parents and focus on drafting those
can’t-miss prospects that will lead
the hapless Cleveland Browns back
to the Super Bowl. If no, proceed to
question 2.

Question 2: Do you enjoy sleeping
late, splitting a minimal rent with a
bunch of roommates and occasion-
ally reading a book?

If no, go back to question 1. If yes,
prepare for the big time: graduate
school.

to an end. So will the hardgaining,
marathon Call of Duty sessions and
late nights with a six-pack of 40s and
a six-pack of $5 pizza pies. It’s about
to get real, friend.

But before that, you need to pick
a university. This is incredibly im—
portant, because at cocktail parties,
cotillions, debutante balls and the
like, you’ll be asked to boil down
eight or nine years of grueling work

in the form of a one-sentence answer ”

to this question: “So where do you
go to school?”

And if you say something like,
“Oh, I’m studying advanced stud-
ies at SUNY-Binghamton,” you’ll
undoubtedly elicit the following
riposte: “Hmm, that’s nice. I know
someone/have a cousin/ have heard
of a person getting his Ph.D. in that
very subject at [the far more presti-
gious] Northwestern University.”

like in undergrad, where a simple
skim of the Sparknotes for “The Mill
on the Floss” was sufficient to en-
sure that you were the best-informed
person in the class, you’ll need to up
your game. With sufﬁcient prodding
and a good enough head of steam,
you might even ﬁnd yourselfreading
an entire chapter of a book every-
few months or so (introductions and
conclusions only —— you’re crazy but g
you’re not stupid!). = « '

On top of all the reading, you’ll
ﬁnd yourself forced to talk out your
posterior about any number of ab-
struse subjects. Since most of your
peers will be doing the same, it’s
more or less a wash. Furthermore,
you can ﬁnesse anyidifl'1cu_lti_nter—

other scholar’s work:

is. Jonas Ruggleteapot’s ﬁrst three

New OCC curriculum can boost career prospects

Ellen Borza
For The Pitt News

Henry Goodelman walked at his 2010 gradua-
tion ceremony with a green cord draped over
his shoulders.

The green signiﬁed completion of Pitt’s
Outside the Classroom Curriculum, a Univer-
sity initiative that began in 2008 with a44-stu-
dent inaugural class. The program’s goal is to
encourage student involvement on campus.

“The green cord isn’t important; the in-
volvement is,” Goodelman said. He gradu-
ated Pitt with a bachelor’s degree in applied
developmental psychology.

Employers say they look for students who
can balance classwork with extracurricular
activities, but students have mixed feelings
on the the importance of the OCC. Although
Goodelman completed the program, he said
he did not feature his OCC transcript on_his re-

sumé when applyingfor a job. -And Pitt doesn’t '

know whether putting the progam on a resume
has helped graduates in the job market.

Pitt doesn’t track the’ post—graduation
successtof students who have completed the
program, but Hoffman said there will be more
statistics by the end of the year.

Pitt’s OCC program — open to all students
and majors — is a way to support the devel-
opment of a well-rounded student. “It’s all
about you and gaining a competitive edge,”
OCC coordinator Scott Hoffman said about
the program.

Freshman Michelle Adigwu said she plans
to start OCC because she understands the

beneﬁts of the program and how OCC will

demonstrate to potential employers her ac-
complishments beyond academics.

“I think it’s good to go out and get involved
to maintain that balance between studying and
a social life,” she said. I '

At various events and programs such as
sporting events, concerts, the Healthy U Fair,
Career Fair and cultural activities like Discover
Pittsburgh, students’ ID cards. are swiped for

’OC(_3 credit. After the events, students are
responsible for recording what they did on
their OCC transcripts online, and they can
then choose to include the record with their
resumés or refer to the program in their in-
terviews. .

Students can access their OCC transcripts
by going to their my.pitt.edu log—in and click-
ing on the “OCC Login” on the right-hand side
of the page. ' '

Some upperclassmen said that they do not
participate in OCC because they feel that the
activities are catered mostly to underclass—
men. f

Junior Sarah Naylor said most OCC events
seem related to Pitt’s First Year Experience
program and appear available only to fresh-
men.

“I think it can get people to want to do
more things, but it doesn’t require you to do
anything but swipe a card,” Naylor said about
the University’s initiative.

Emilie Foley said that OCC is a good idea,

but doesn’t cater to upperclassmen and doesn’t
really prepare student for the real world.

Naylor and Foley both said they felt that
it is too easy for students to swipe their cards
for credit and then not do anything beneﬁcial
at events. They said that events like ice cream
socials are designed to help students network,
but some students might not take ﬁill advan-
tage of the opportunities.

Goodelman said that he did not use his OCC
transcript when he applied for jobs because of
the lack of descriptive evidence about what he
did at each event. He said that he didn’t think
the documentation would be worth presenting

to prospective employers.

But he said that for students who do use
OCC to their beneﬁt, it could be a good way
to keep track of things that would enhance
a resume.

Freshman Samantha Wagner said that she
thinks OCC will make her a competitive can-
didate in the job market.

“It shows I care enough about my future to
do something about it,” she said. ’

Hoffman said that completion of the OCC
goals will aid students in the hiring process
if graduates speak to employers about the
OCC.

“Employers shared with us that the goals
and outcomes of the OCC matched up with
the types of experiences they seek in appli-
cants for positions with their companies,”
Hoffman said.

Hoffman said that OCC organizers con-
densed the program this year, reducing the
number of experiences students need to fulﬁll
the program’s requirements. They also dis-
continued OCC credit for activities that would
normally be completed by students even with-
out the program.

For The Pitt News

Like many seniors this year, Brit-
tany Robertson is in the process of
applying for graduate school.

“I think it’s gotten a lot more
competitive,” the urban studies and
psychology double major said.

Robertson, who wants to be-
come a counselor or a therapist,
ﬁnds herself in the same predica-
ment as other graduate school ap-
plicants deciding whether or not
grad school is ﬁnancially worth
the gamble. She hopes to receive
some sort of scholarship or ﬁnan-
cial aid. Robertson is planning on
earning her graduate degree in
Psychology from either Pitt, Uni-
versity of Maryland, Drexel, NYU
or Temple.

“A lot of people are staying in
school longer,” Roberston said,
citing the’economy’s downturn as
a major reason for her observa-
tion.. A

The impact a graduate school
degree has on a person’s resume re-
mains up for debate. While enroll-
ment and costs remain on the rise,
the number of graduate students

Pitt’s Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs has declined
in the past year. «

The GSPIA’s Associate Director
of Career Services,Jessica Hather-
ill, said she believes that despite
numbers GSPIA offers helpful pro-
fessional experience.

Hatherill said GSPIA holds
various career—building events, in-
cluding mock interviews, resume-
building‘ and speed networking,
along with a speaker series in
which “alumni [speak of] what
they wish they would have known
when they were in grad school.”
This is meant to help students pick
a focus for graduate school.

Despite Hatherill’s descrip-
tion of the career-oriented events
the graduate school provides, the
statistics she provided are not as
hopeful. ‘

In 2010, 69.7 percent of recent
GSPIA graduates were unemployed
six months after graduation, up
from 50 percent the last year,
Hatherill said.

According to the Bureau of La-
bor Statistics, the average unem-

ployment rate for doctoral degree .

holders in 2009 was 2.5 percent.

Those with Ph.D.s have an unem-
ployment rate of 2.3 percent.
More students have come to
Pitt for school, as well. The num-
ber of graduate school students at
Pitt increased from 9,535 in 2005
to 10,452 in 2010. Of last year’s
graduates from Pitt’s undergradu-
ate schools, 34 percent have gone
on to graduate school. i
Ryan Sweeny, the assistant di-
rector in the Career Development

Oﬂice, said that not only has the ‘
number of graduate students in- v

creased over the years, but the
costs have, too.

“Graduate school costs have
risen in- a similar fashionto over-
all higher education costs,” which

Pitt students have certainly seen .

the ugly sideof, Sweeny said in an
email.

For Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health, tuition for in—state
students is $22,012 per term for
this year. This is an increase from
2006, when tuition for one term
was $16,384 for in-state stu-
dents.

This trend applies to every Pitt
graduate school’s tuition, which-
have all jumped more than $3,000
since 2006. ‘

These rates are on par with
the national rate. According to
the Council of Graduate Schools,
a national organization, the cost
of graduate school has surged in
the past decade, increasing by 60
percent.

The increasing price of these.

schools might not be worth it for
some students, Sweeny said. He
said many students apply to gradu-
ate school for the wrong reasons.

“If a student is still undecided
about a career path and they are
using graduate school as a way of
extending their education to have
more time to pick a career, this is
a poor reason to attend graduate
school [because] graduate school
is usually much more narrowly fo-
cused than one’s undergraduate
program and offers little to no op-
portunities to explore other areas
of study,” Sweeny said.

He said that it is important to
attend graduate school if it’s nec-
essary for a career in a ﬁeld like
law, medicine or counseling, or if a
graduate degree makes the student
more competitive. ~ .

Sweeny said that a graduate
degree is important if students
need it for a speciﬁc career ﬁeld,

THE srAMArrAcK

 

Job experience mattersmore than degree level

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Hello, seniors. Thank goodness
I’m not one of you yet. ‘
Things are looking pretty
bleak out there: Some ofyou will
probably have to settle for jobs for
which you are over-qualiﬁed. It’s
little wonder, then, that many are
electing to forgo that journey for
now and instead plunge straight

_ into graduate school, in an effort

to better their chances.

But to all you about to make
this decision, I say: stop.

Unless you are seeking a life in
academia (which, on an unrelated
note, I would too suggest avoid-
ing) or going to a, professional
school for medicine or law, you
have very few reasons to jump
immediately into more schooling
— the additional years right after
graduation might do little to in-
crease your income and employ-
ment prospects in the future.

To begin the argument against
jumping right into things, I start
with the opposing argument that’s
for jumping right into things —

0 sum
0 0 cum
0 cocci

that argument being that degrees
signal to employers your ability
to excel at work. This rationale
approaches a degree as evidence
for potential employers that you

. .aren’t a schmuck.

Thus, some will argue, rushing

now, and the signal is sent out

’ earlier, and you are one step clos-

er to your gold—encrusted bath-

room. After all, when offered the '

choice between somebody with
a master’s and somebody with
a lesser degree, employers will

quickly declines as employers de-
cide for themselves how talented
of a worker you are. Your ability
to think critically and contrib-
ute value to your organization,
as well as your ability to make
meetings on time, drastically

to get a graduate degree simply decide that the former is the less overshadows the signaling abil-
means rushing to show the world
that you are competent and de-
serve more money. Go to school

schmucky one. _
However, the signaling capa-

ity of degrees. »
The statistics profession

bility of a master’s degree very ﬁttingly enough, provides data

showing this to be the case,

through the form of an annual

survey prepared by the Ameri-
can Statistical Association. In
this ﬁeld, master’s—degree hold-
ers earn more on average, but
mainly because their incomes
have a wider range than those
with bachelor’s. Nevertheless,
the data shows that those with

-bachelor’s degrees still earn way

more than those with master’s
— the 50th'percentile salary for
the former, in fact, is more than

‘ the 50th percentile salary for the

latter.

Whofknows if this holds true‘
for other professions. But wheth-
er or not it does, it shows that you
don’t necessarily add income to
your prospects with an advanced
degree. Instead, your actual per-
formance determines your in-

FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND "
PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their edu-
cation records: These rights include:

- The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the University receives
a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other
appropriate program director, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University ofﬁ-
cial will make arrangements for access and notify the students of the time and place where the records may be in-
spected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that off -
cial shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.

- The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate.
Students may ask the University to amend a record that.they believe is in a curate. They should write the Univer-
sity ofticial responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it
is inaccurate. .

lf the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student
of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Addi-
tional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notiﬁed of the right to a
hearing and is available at UP Policy and Procedure 09-08-01.

- The right to consent to disclosures of personally identiﬁable information containedin the student's

education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent One exception, which
pennits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school ofﬁcials with legitimate educational interests. A school
official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support
staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the Uni-
versity has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trust-
ees; cr a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting an-
other school ofﬁcial in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the offi-
cial needs to review an education record in order to fulﬁll his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the
University will disclose education records without consent to ofﬁcials of another school in which a student seeks or
intends to enroll. The University will forward records on request of another school.

- The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by University of
Pittsburgh to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Ofﬁce that administers
FERPA is: ' .
_ Family Policy Compliance Office
US. Department of Education
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
Washington, DC 20202-4605

- The University may establish categories of information known as “Directory information" and release this informa-

tion without students oonsent, upon request. A student may request, in the format released without the students
consent if requested by a third party. The University designates the personally identiﬁable information contained in
a Student's Educational Record listed below as “Directory information”:

1. The Students Name

2. The Student's address, phone number and electronic mail address

3. The Student's major field or study

4. Place of Birth

5. The Student's achievements, degrees academic awards, or honors

7. The Student's previous educational institutions

8. Participation in ofﬁcially recognized activities and sports

9. Dates of attendance

10. The Student's photograph

When the ofﬁce of the University Registrar receives a student's refusal to permit the release of "Directory informa-
tion”, no further disclosures are made without that students written consent (except to parties who have legal
access to student records without written consent). A student may rescind this action by submitting the request in
writing to the Ofﬁce of the University Registrar. Note that the following Procedures apply:
1. Students may review their educational records by submitting a written request to the Record Custodian in the
appropriate university unit. A listing of those University offices, which routinely possess education records of stu-
dents, are set forth in University Procedure 09-08-01. -
2. Students may request amendment of education records that they believe are inaccurate or misleading, by sub-
mitting a written request to the Record Custodian and following the steps set forth in the University Procedure 09-
08-01
3. As set forth in the University Policy 09-08-01, access to student's education records may be required and per-
mitted by University faculty and staff for legitimate educational purposes where access by such individuals is nec-
essary to complete their University-related duties.

Office etiquette stands when out with the boss

Emma Kilcup
_ Staﬁ'Writer

Most college students are ﬁrm believers of _
the mantra “work hard, play hard.” But it’s _

easy to go too hard when it comes to ‘‘play—
ing” — i.e., partying —— with the boss.

Colleagues often go out together dur-
ing happy hour. But those navigating the
career world for the first time may face
_some difficulty drawing the lines when
business meets pleasure.

7   The ..Co.ro.. Centerzfor. Civic—.L.ead.ership,..-_

focuses on producing leaders and often
organizes happy hours at local bars and
restaurants. Misti McKeehen, the director
of operations and outreach for the Pitts-
burgh branch, said that the event mainly.
focuses on networking and professional-
ism. These types of gatherings often in-
clude young professionals interning at
the Coro Center. .

“In a culture that accepts social activi-
ties, I always encourage employees and

interns to ‘use their heads,”’ McKeehen i

said in an email. “While you may be inter-
acting in a social setting, your colleagues
always need to continue to be treated as
if you were in a professional setting. If
something doesn’t ‘ﬂy’ in the office  it
should never enter a social setting.”

McKeehen explained that employees
should follow the boss’s lead —— if the boss
is a good example. She outlines some rules:
“Don’t go ‘over the top’ (drinking, eat-
ing, language, personal stories). Keep it
all within reason. Don’t engage in ofﬁce
gossip —— it’s not appropriate in any set-
ting. Don’t assume that a happy hour or
social outing means that professionalism
doesn’t apply.”

Donna Gerson, the former director of
career services at the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Law from 1993 until 2001,
counseled students and worked with off-
campus recruiting. She is now a full—time
speaker and writer.One of her books,
“Modern Rules of Business Etiquette,”

‘outlines the rules for remaining profes-

sional and respected at work.

“Business socializing has always helped
team building,” Gerson said. “Of course
you want to be respected, but you also
want to have fun with colleagues. For many,
work is like a second home. Socializing
helps build relationships of trust.”

Running an errand with a boss or grab-
bing lunch with co-workers is expected
by most employees, but cocktail hour can
throw a new curveball. “N 0 shots” and “no
passing out” replace the simple dining
etiquette ‘of “no elbows on the table” or
.“no chewing with your mouth open.”

“Alcohol is a fabulous social lubricant.
It lowers inhibitions, so carefully moni-
tor alcoholintake and do not overshare,”

‘Gerson said. “Have one beer, maybe two
beers in the span of two hours. Don’t en-
gage in the drinking culture; you want to
stay in control.” W
Gerson suggests minimizing alcohol
intake and not forgoing etiquette, but she
has one ultimate piece of advice:
“Think,” Gerson said. “You have to be
aware of the repercussions of your actions.
Don’t overshare. We live in an oversharing
world but you have to think about what you

say before you share it.”

Though the guidelines seem-predict-
able, the switch from college life to real
life can be daunting, with many students
using Facebook and other networking sites
to broadcast weekend activities. Gerson
said that everyone makes mistakes, but
employees and job seekers nowlneed to
beaware of the public image portrayed
through the socialnetworking sites.

“What I come to expect is that each

intern will be themselves, will converse to
their level of comfort, and in some cases
remain very private,” McKeehen said.
“That is okay. It is when the opposite ex-
treme is met that a conversation has to
occur to perform corrective actions.”
Gerson said it was a sign of the times.

ingto multitask and plan ahead of time, but it also
looks good tobe able to attach Teach ForAmerica
to your resume.”

Adrian Monge, Pitt’s campus coordinator for

4-Teach For America, said, “I think that students
recognize that it’s a great opportunity not only
for them to do something very meaningful after
college, butalso agreatopportunity forthemselves
in terms of ﬁntheringtheir own professional and
academic aspirations.”

Monge said that “the idea isn’t that we are at—‘
tracting the most worthy students and keeping
them in education forever.”

Instead she said thatTeach ForAmerica mem-
bers’ two-year service allows them to serve as ad—’
vocates in their ﬁeld of interest after they complete
the program.

 “Teach ForAmerica isn’t your average Ameri-
Corps program. It’s notlike the Peace Corps where
you’re volunteeringyourtime and gettingasmall
stipend atthe end. With Teach ForAmerica, you re-
ceiveafullteachers salarybeneﬁt and anAmerican
education award of $10,000 interms offurthering
your education afterward,” Monge said.

Bateman 4 8

Other student: Ah, I recall possibly reading
those. Very important. But you simply must
read Kamperland’s critique of post—1iteracy.-

You: I believe I have, and it was most likely
thought—provoking. What about Dusselbra—
haus?

Other student: Certainly. Izod—Lacoste?

You; Very cutting-edge, much like Van
Heusen.

In addition to curating these long lists of
g“relevant’.’ scholarly works —— few of which
ever need to be read, or are —— you’ll be hard
at work on a thesis or dissertation. As tempt-
ing as it might sound, you can’t ﬁnish one of

 magnum opuses merely by cutting.—and—. ..
pasting a handful of Wikipedia summaries ‘
together and calling it a day. No, you must
produce “original conten ” —— but even this
herculean task can be rendered manageable.
Check this out: a    s - ’

Other student: How is that thesis coming
along? I’ve written ﬁve pages.

You (lying): I’ve already written it and
submitted it to ﬁve refereed journals. Also, I
already have a job offer. Oh, and next week‘I’m

going to appear on TV for some reason.

See what you did there? That other stu-
dent was trying to put the screws to you, and
instead of admitting that you’d spent the week
slacking off, you just lied. Since most of your
careeras a serious graduate student will con-

sist of “smoke—and-mirrors” productivity of
this sort, cultivate the ﬁne art of deception as
soon as possible.

This brings us to the most signiﬁcant dif-
ference between your life as an undergraduate
and your career as a Ph.D. student: Since there
are way more things you’re supposed to be
doing, you’re going to have to spend far more
time not doing them. A lazy Sunday spent on
the couch watching Peyton “Overrated” Hillis
and his hapless Cleveland Browns lose another
game is kid stuff — as we wrote earlier, you’re

in the big leagues now. We’re talking weeks
spent alone and indoors without a single ac-
complishment to show for it, and only a soul-
crushing sense of guilt to sustain you in your
procrastination. I

So We leave you with one ﬁnal question:
Do you have the intestinal fortitude to shirk
your work indeﬁnitely, passing the time by
reading those oh—so—hilarious Ph.D. Comics
‘— a webcomic where the central “joke” is that
the characters are also shirking their graduate
studies and thus experiencing soul—crushing

' guilt for doing so — and trying to evade the

“invisible hand” of our great nation’s crum—
bling, fatally ﬂawed service economy? Because
, if you do, more power to you. It’s a jungle out
there and whatnot.

And that’s often what people who are
working and have tattoos do. The service
industry can be especially diﬂicult, though
there are aspects where tattoos can be a

‘ tattoo—friend1y, said Rachel Nyanjom, a se-

nior French and Africana studies major.
Nyanjom worked part—time at a bar
where many of her patrons sported more

_.i.I2k.th.eLn , . . s ._ 
The small pineapple tattoo she‘l1’as”6’rI”"  

her left middle ﬁnger was hardly scandal-
ous among the large sleeve tattoos she saw
at work. It even helped her connect with ‘
patrons. - I

“It can be a conversation piece. I’ve

Liberal arts education critical for employment

I actually enjoy Shakespeare. I know, I know, but

qglvhenever Shakespeare is mentioned, I never
contribute to the chorus of groans sweeping
the classroom.

Of course, unpacking his text to the last
stanza and then developing new theories of
character development is not my idea of enjoy-
ing literature. My approach is more cursory. I
read simply because I need a release from all
the technical courses that seem to occupy my
schedule. Understanding the exact molecular
mechanism governing how a neuron releases a
transmitter is important in its own context. But
there has to be more to my day than just that. I

this escape from my normal routine. I am cur-

In the United States, acollege education in

uate school should come directly after
your undergraduate education. Given that
the signaling aspect of a quickly—pursued
master’s is weak at best, the real question
is if more education right now will really

add more to your value as _a worker than ,

acquiring it after a few years off.

To understand how we add value to
ourselves, we have to understandlhow we
learn. One speciﬁc view, the construction-
ist theory, holds that we learn by mixing
past experiences_with new knowledge.
New facts and ways of thinking only make
us “smarter” if they can be placed into
some kind of context that we already un-
derstand. V

Drop a Viking and a 21st century college
student into a lesson on ax battle tactics,
the Viking will become “smarter” than
the college student over the course of the
lesson. Even if both people are equally
intelligent, the Viking warrior would have
context — he’d understand that the legs
are the weakest part of a Viking’s armor
and would take special note of applicable
lessons e whereas the college kid would
have no clue what was going on.

Now who will be the more desirable

candidate to the king of a new Viking clan‘?

In the long run, it will be the learner who
was already a Viking, because he was able
to place what he learned at Viking Uni-
versity into context. The king will reward
him with a larger share of the plunder as
he uses this information to benefit the
group. - .

So as it was with Vikings then, it is with
college kids now. Regardless of what your
graduate work is, a candidate with some

  
  
     
  

experience in the job market, whether or
not the work is “degrading,” will be able
to place more of what he or she learns
into context. Even if the graduate work
is only tangentially related to life in an
office somewhere, the skills might still
be found relevant.

To wait a year or two, then, means to
gain experience and have graduate school
increase your value to employers. Those

jumping into it knowing nothing but school
likely won’t gain as much in terms of ser-
vicable skills.

Thus, if in the long run your goal is to
have higher income and better job pros;
pects, it might be best to wait. Just having
a degree might provide some income, but
having actual skills is far more beneficial.
A year off is a good way to help lay a foun-
dation for such development.

are rules at universities that parallel the
rules of job etiquette. Resident assistants

assistants do not suggest the class go out
for martinis. Professors are not encour-
aged to hand out jagerbombs to break the
ice during the ﬁrst week of class.

“There are deﬁnitely boundaries and
distinct rules with a lot of jobs,” Pitt alum-
na Molly Kane said. “I TA classes, and I

with students 3’ _
Kane, who graduated in 2011 as a ge-

attends the University of Oklahoma where
she now plays the role of a superior; to stu-

dents as_a TA. Kane explains that social— _

izing can help create openness and help

students feel less afraid to ask questions
but acknowledges the distinct boundar-
ies.

For the under-21 crowd, the boundaries
extend even further, and etiquette can only
do so much. Since many college students
are still waiting for the ability to enter a
bar, those who intern or work with col-
leagues of drinking age must say ‘no’ to
happy-hour bonding... Fortunately, there

drinking where students can get to know
their colleagues.

, “Social interaction happens as you sit
inlthe lunchroom, as you are volunteering
at a‘ local-event, as new colleagues come
and go,” McKeehen said in an email. “We

tend to do potluck lunches, ask about each -‘

others’ weekends, and always do a per-
sonal chec_k-in at the beginning of each
staff meeting.” ’

Employers and employees alike can
agree on the simple rule that the office is
a professional place and if that the office
branches out to other venues, the same
rules of conduct should apply.

Junior Rachel Browning said she can relate
to Morgenstem’s sentiments about post-gradu-
ation plans as she contemplates joiningthe Peace
Corps.

“I’masocial work majorso Iwantto get some
ﬁeldworkpractice beforelactually startpractic-
ing social work,” Browning said. “Secondly, I’m
really unsure about my plans after college. So I
ﬁgure why not do somethingwhere I can see the
world and make a difference in someone’s life
while becoming more cultured myself?”

While the thought of spending 27 months
abroad is a bit daunting to Browning, she said

___.. ,..<,.-,.

the sacriﬁce is worthwhile.

“You do have to recognize that you can’t go
into a counuy for six months trying to set up a
reform program and expect it to be ﬁmctioning
six months after you started it. You have to put
more time into it,” Browning said.

While prospective applicants and participants
alike cite job uncertainty as afactor in their deci-
sion to apply, the Peace Corps does not view it as
the main incentive. '

“We do not see the economy as a factor in

people’s decision to join,” Levine said. “Our ap-

plicants are committed to public service and often

mention wanting to join to continue theirvolun—
teer efforts during their interviews.”

Seniors interested in either Teach For Amer—
ica or the Peace Corps are encouraged to apply
soon, as the process can take about a year to
complete.

Teach ForAmerica involves afour-step process
involvingthe completion ofan online application
where students submit personal, academic and
professional information, a resume and a letter
of intent. From there, applicants will complete.a
two—part online activity, a phone interview and
a ﬁnal interview before they are notiﬁed of their
acceptance.

The Peace Corps involves a ﬁve—step appli-
cation process before accepted members can

application form involvingtwo essays, three refer-
ences and a resume. Those who will potentially
quality will then be contacted for step two, an in-
terview, before havingtheir application reviewed
for nomination by a recruiter.

Applicants who have been nominated will
then undergo a ﬁnal “health, legal, suitability,
and competitive review” before receiving their
ﬁnal invitation into the program.

The Peace Corps recommends beginning by
Oct. 1 for those intending to begin their service
in fall 2012.

Teach For Americahas set ﬁve rolling admis-
sions deadlines for students. The next one is Oct.

“Lawsuit won’t affect agency’s investigation of Pitt    

4 Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Former Pitt football head coach
Michael Haywood’s federal lawsuit
against the University won’t have an
effect on the Pennsylvania Human
Relations Commission investigation
into Haywood’s ﬁring.

PHRC spokeswoman Shannon. - ..

Powers saidinanemailthatthe PHRC,
not the EEOC, is conductingthe inves-
tigation. She added thatthe complaint

M ._¢;g.,tl1at Haywood’s rights are protected

..,.Did Pitt make the ri ht decision in 'oinin the ACC?

WY‘.

under both federal, the EEOC is afed-
eral agency, and state law.

The PHRC received Haywood’s
complaint questionnaire on June 30
and began an investigation in mid
August Powers said on Aug. 16 that
public information is limited to ?the
complaint from Haywood and its ﬁl-

ing date.

The complaint in the lawsuit said
that the University breached its con-
tractwith Haywood and his due pro-
cess rights, while the complaint ﬁled
with the PHRC cites a racial motiva-
tion for his ﬁring and lists employ-
ment discrimination as its main point.
The PHRC investigation is still open,
Powers said, and since the suit Hay-

woodﬁled and the PHRC. complaint,  ,.

cite separate allegations, they can take_
place simultaneously.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele de-
clined comrnent on Monday, saying
the University does not comment
on pending litigation. Pitt Athletics
spokesman E.J. Borghetti also de-
clined comment.

The lawsuit and investigation stem
from Pitt’s ﬁring of Haywood onjan.
1. The night before that, less than two
weeks after he was hired, police ar-
rested Haywoodin South Bend, Ind.,

on charges of domestic abuse against
the mother of his child.

At a court hearing on Feb. 11,
Haywood entered a court diver-
sion program in Indiana, which
requires 60 hours of community
service and a psychological evalu-
ation. If he completes the deal, the
charges willbe dismissed in one year.
Court documents said that during the
hearing, Haywood admitted to touch-

ingthe mother ofhis child in a“rude, ‘ ‘ '

insolent or angry manner” and said
she suffered an injury after falling.
Ajune 28 news release from Buz-
bee_ Law Firm said that soon after the
domestic abuse allegation, the mother
ofHaywood’s child ﬁled papers saying
that Haywood didn’t pose a danger to
her or their then—21-month—old child

- and that “the submitted paperwork

also raised questions about the ac-
curacy of the police report.”
The lawsuit asserts that Pitt didn’t

honor an agreement to buy out Hay-
wood’s $300,000 contract with Mi-
ami University of Ohio.

Haywood would have received up
to'$7.5 million plus incentives from
the ﬁve—year contract with Pitt, the
complaint states, and he is lookingfor
at least $3.75 million in damages. Ac-
cording to the complaint, Haywood’s
contract entitled him to $750,000 for
each year remaining on the contract

if the University ﬁred him 
T just cause.”

Powers said that ifHaywood want-
ed to ﬁle a separate lawsuit in federal
court citing the same allegations as
the PHRC complaint, he would either
have to wait 180 days after he ﬁledhis
complaint or the PHRC would have to
close the investigation.

Haywood can’t enter a complaint
in state court until a year after the ﬁl-
ing date, Powers said, and added that
the PHRC ceases investigations after

they are turned over to the courts.

At the conclusion of the commis-
sion’s investigation, which could take
up to a year, the PHRC would reach
one of two ﬁndings: probable cause
or no probable cause.

If there is probable cause of dis-
crimination, Powers said there would
be one last effortto settle and then the
case would proceed to a public hear-
ing. Ifthere is no probable cause, the

to put forth ﬁirther information.
The new information is then re-
viewed in a preliminary hearing and
if no cause is found, the party is in-
formed of his or her right to ﬁle the

. caseincourt.

Under state law, the party must
allow the PHRC one year to inves-
tigate the claim. If the case is still
open“ after one year, the party is
notiﬁed so that he or she can ﬁle a
case in the court of common pleas.
