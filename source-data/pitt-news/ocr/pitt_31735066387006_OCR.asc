Months of speculation by fans
and media and evasive answers
from coach and administration
are over. When his contract runs
out March 31, Paul -Evans’ tenure
as Pitt’s head basketball coach
will be over too.

Yesterday, Pitt Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes announced
that Evans, who has been the
Panthers’ coach since March 27,
1986, will finish the season.

“We offered him a contract,”
Jaynes said. “He had some stipu-

contract that we would not agree

to. In essence, a counteroffer
was made to us and we felt that
we were not in a position to do
that. The contract was taken off
the table.”

Jaynes refused to answer alle-
gations that the offer was inten-
tionally unacceptable to Evans,
forcing the coach to leave
instead of ﬁring him.

“I will not get into details of
the contract,” Jaynes said. “We
feel like it was a fair contract.”

Timing is one of the questions
surrounding the issue. Jaynes
refused to say why the university
did notmake a serious offer until

this past month.

“We felt that we made a fair
offer to him at the appropriate
time,” Jaynes said.

That time may have set Pitt
back in recruiting. At least one
prospective Pitt recruit said that
the unsure position was a factor
in his choice to go elsewhere.

“That’s all speculation,” Jaynes
said. “I can’t comment.”

Jaynes admitted that the situa-
tion could have been handled
differently.

“Would we like it to be differ-
ent? Yes,” Jaynes said. “If I could
go back and change things,

go through a period like we
have gone through the last few
months, there are always things
you would like to change.”

Jaynes acknowledged that the
decision not to retain Evans was
not his alone, but a “university
decision.” He also said that the
team’s current seven-game los-
ing streak had nothing to do with
the contract negotiations.

There is no timetable for
choosing a new coach, but the
administration will meet to come
up with onesoon. Jaynes said
that right now he is concentrat-
ing on the personnel currently at

Evans rejects contract, Pitt looks for new coch‘

season rather than what the uni-
versity’s next step will be.

“We would like to have a
coach as soon as possible,”
Jaynes said. “The most important
thing right now is to make sure
that we have the right person.”

The search for a new coach
may be complicated by the fact
that the future of the Big East
Conference is in question. The
football-only schools are push-
ing for entry into conference
competition in all other sports,
and some fomi of realignment is
expected.

T rip gives SGB new ideas for improving Pitt

By Matt Groff '
Asst. News Editor

Student Government Board President

Ross Pasquale, President Pro Tempore
Elizabeth Mania, Allocations Committee
Chair Damian Cevallos and board member
Chris Fedeli travelled to the Conference of
Student Government Associations last
weekend and said they brought back new
ideas and a new appreciation for Pitt’s stu-
dent government.
, “We talked a lot about concerns like
transportation at other universities and it
showed us how great Pitt deals with prob-
lems and how responsive Pitt is to the
problems here,” Mania said. “A lot of
schools were very interested in our pro-
grams: allocations, security and shuttles.”

The conference was held in College
Station, Texas, at Texas A&M University.

According to Pasquale, Pitt was one of the
smaller schools represented at the confer-
ence which included 408 student-govern-
ment delegates representing 84 colleges
and universities from around the United
States. He said there were also two dele-
gates from Japan.

Mania said Pitt will be looking to some of
their contacts soon for help on this year’s
projects.

“The University of Florida is working on
a program similar to the debit card we are
trying to establish,” Mania said. “T hey’re
about a year ahead of us in their work and
can help us progress. We hope to help
other schools which are just now planning
programs like Choice Dollars.”

The debit card is a project in which stu-
dents could make pay a certain amount of
money and receive credit on a debit card
(similar to a bank card) which they could

use at the bookstore, pharmacy and other
facilities around campus.

Pasquale said he plans to put a greater
emphasis on student government recruit-
ment throughout this year.

“One of the main thingsl learned was
definitely that we need to utilize ‘incoming
freshmen more,” Pasquale said. “Since
we’re conscious of that, Elizabeth and I
have a lot of time between now and the
Freshmen Activities Fair [in August] to come
up with good ideas to recruit people.”

He said it is important to recruit quality
individuals who will stay involved with stu-
dent government throughout their under-
graduate years.

“We want to make SGB more accessible
and the candidates more qualified,” Mania
‘said. She said Pitt’s SGB was one of the
more efficient student governments repre-

Panelists
speak of
Jewish pride
on campus

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Last night’s “Choosing to be
Jewish” panel discussion gave"
about 15 students, faculty members
and members of Pittsburgh’s Jewish
community something to talk about
besides the snow.

Discussion of Jewish religion, tra-
dition, ethnicity and people high-
lighted the session in the Cathedral
of Learning, which was the final
event of the Hillel—sponsored
Jewish Awareness Week.

Pitt Jewish Studies professor
Barbara Burstin, one of the pan-
elists, said she follows Judaism
because she feels close ties with
the entire Jewish community.

“I feel linked with a tradition and
a people who have survived for
long and who have made so many
contributions,” Burstin said. “Being
Jewish allows me to celebrate so
many wonderful occasions  there
are so many opportunities to come
together as a family.”

Panelist Matthew Yeager, who is
in the process of converting to
Judaism, said the religion helped
give his life some more structure,
something Yeager said his past reli-
gious experiences could not fully
provide.

"‘[Judaisml is the only religion and
culture I’ve experienced that gives
you a really close, personal rela-
tionship with God,” Yeager said.
“The Jewish" experience is 24 hours
_a day, seven days a week  being
Jewish gives a much different per-
spective on the world.”

Hillel’s Pitt co-Chair Amy
Stemthal said she enjoys being able
to talk about and explain her per-
spectives on Judaism to people out-
side Pitt’s Jewish community.

“People are always asking me
questions about things they don’t
understand about our religion,”

the issue were settled in time for the search
for a new coach, but that may not be realistic.
‘ “We know we are going to play basketball
and we are going to be in some configura-
tion of teams we are affiliated with. I don’t

think that will become an issue.”

Evans was not available for comment, but
he did release a statement through Pitt’s
Sports Information department.

“I’m naturally disappointed that we were
unable to reach an agreement,” Evans said.

“I’Ve enjoyed my eight years at Pitt, and
I believe our players and the program
have achieved success on a number of differ-
ent levels. I sincerely hope b0th the players
and the program will continue to be success-

ful. ”

SGB

sented at the conference.
According to Mania, other gov-
ernments get bogged down with
the existence of several levels of
government bodies. I

Pasquale said a comparison of
SGB’s election process gave him
an appreciation for Pitt’s system
and its students’ involvement.

“There are other schools
which only have a 2 percent
voter turnout [for student gov-
ernment elections] and they are
roughly the same size as Pitt,”
Pasquale said. He said Pitt’s
tumour in the 1993 election was
approximately 20 percent.

According to Pasquale, one
thing which surprised other del-
egates about Pitt was the park-
ing problem.

“[Other delegates] Were
astounded by the prices we pay
for parking at Pitt,” Pasquale
said. “Most of them paid about
$50 and complain about it.”

He said there are other stu-
dent govemments who aren’t as
regulated as the SGB, but also
don’t experience the controversy
on issues such as student activity
fees.

“At some schools, student
government completely controls
the student activities fee,” he

said. “They don’t have to go to
the board of trustees, they can
just raise [the feel when they
want to and people don’t care.”

Both Pasquale and Mania said
they experienced “culture
shock” at some of the activities
which were central to the Texas
A&M college lifestyle.

“All these people knew about
square dancing and country
dancing,” Pasquale said. “It was
evident that the Texas A&M tra-
dition and history are so
ingrained into students’ daily
existence.”

“It doesn’t matter what student
group you’re in  if you’re in

student government or if you’re
Greek  it just matters that you
go to Texas A&M. They all care
so much about their school and
are very proud,” Pasquale said.
He said that he’d like to see
more pride like this at Pitt, but
realizes the city atmosphere pre-
sents many drawbacks in com-
parison to a spacious 5,000—acre
campus.

Other local schools represent-
ed at the conference included

Ohio State, Indiana University of '

Pennsylvania and Pitt-
Johnstown. According to
Pasquale, Pitt was the oldest
institution represented.

INFORMATION/APPLICATION PACKAGE

    

Coach ’sfz'rmg afoul shot

The head coach of Pitt’s men’s basketball team will
not have his contract extended beyond this season,
but he will finish out this season. What this means is
that he has been essentially hung out to dry as of
March 31. This is a poor time in the season to choose
to do this, especially since the problems which are
being cited now have been hanging over Evans’ head
all season, including when the contract was initially
offered. Leaving a coach unsure of whether or not his
contract will be renewed is not only harmful to the
coach’s own morale, but one can only wonder what
effect this must have on a team.

There has been a push for stability within the athlet-
ic department, but this is no way to develop any kind
of stability for future coaches. Any major changes of
this kind should have been made long before recruit-
ing season began, and not after the season has begun
to wind down. This specific situation should have
been resolved .long before the recruiting season
began, not after basketball season was well underway.

In light of recent changes in the football program, it
seems that the move not to extend Evans’ contract
was to give the appearance of stability while changing
the guards. By allowing Evans’ contract to run out, the
athletic department does not have to actually fire two
coaches within one year’s time. ,

Although Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes said that
“lost kids [recruits] were ‘speculation,”’ can any talent-
ed, athlete be expected to entrust his skill to a pro-
gram which cannot deal honestly with a coach at the
beginning of a season? If there is not enough respect
for the coaches to treat them with due consideration,
can an athlete expect better treatment? J

Athletes will not only be reluctant to get involved
because of these concerns, but also because they
were recruited by Evans. Now that he has left, they
will have no idea who will be at the helm of the pro-
gram.

How can the administration expect to get good
employees when they are inconsistent with the ones
that are currently working for them?

They cannot reasonably expect to attract talented,
loyal individuals when there are no guarantees for fair
treatment. Jaynes said that “the most important thing
is to make sure that we have the right person,” but
will the right person want to sign on with those who
won’t deal fairly with him?

This has tarnished the image of Pitt’s men’s basket-
ball program, and of the athletic department as a

. whole, and Jaynes even admitted at a press confer-
ence that the situation could have been handled bet— _

ter. The administration should look at the precedent
this sets and guard against repeating such actions in
the future.

On Feb. 15, 1994, President Clinton
announced that the United States was taking the
first step in escalating the trade war with Japan,
ostensibly in response to the Japanese govern-
ment not allowing Motorola to sell enough
mobile phones in Tokyo.

What Clinton needs to understand is that in
the game of international trade there is a certain
way to deal with the rest of the world and there
is a way to deal with Japan. In my opinion, if a
full—scale trade war does erupt with Japan the
United States will be the clear loser.

Some people feel that the trade sanctions
against Japan are racially motivated, but I don’t
believe that is the case. A mix-

U.S. must tread lightly with Japan

The fact is that the Japanese economic miracle
was built by a hard—working, well-educated pop-
ulace that has been, and still is, willing to pay
high consumer prices when asked by the gov-

ernment to do so because they view it as their v

patriotic duty.

This is a concept that few Americans can fully
understand or appreciate when dealing with the
Japanese. When Japan is threatened, the people
will support their government 100 percent.
Patriotism means more to them than saving a
few yen on consumer goods or food. This fact
cannot be overlooked when negotiating with
Japan. . ‘

rance is the main reason why

improvements in opening up
its markets. For example, U.S.
semiconductors now account
for 20 percent of the market
share in Japan, which is an

Some U.S. complaints against
Japan are legitimate. In 1993 the
United States had a record trade deficit of $59.32
billion with Japan despite some improvements
on the part of the Japanese (The Wall Street
journal, Feb. 18). .

While certainly not all of this deficit can be
attributed to Japanese protectionism, it is just as
certain that at least part of it can be, particularly
in regard to agricultural products.

Last year, Japan promised to allow the import
of Washington red apples as long as U.S. farmers
grew them to the standards which Japan set. The
farmers did that, but the apples were still
blocked from being imported.

This year the Japanese government has once
again promised to buy Washington apples as
long as they pass Japanese “inspections.” Don’t
count on it. Clearly this kind of stonewalling
does nothing to help the Japanese consumer or
the image of Japan in the international trade

community. Nor does the fact that Japan’s global ‘

trade surplus in 1992 was $132 billion (Time
June 21, 1993).

All of that being said, the United States is cer-
tainly not without blame in this trading fiasco.
When the United States deals with.Japan, it is
done through a lack of understanding and com-
munication, a certain amount of arrogance and,
until very recently, a lack of market research in
Japan (i.e. huge cars, which one .couldn’t possi-
bly find a parking space for in Tokyo).

What works in trade negotiations with the
European Community simply doesn’t work with
the Japanese. The United States will not break
into Japanese markets by crying foul and claim-
ing that Japan is “dumping” its products into the
U.S. market. It is obvious that U.S. consumers
like Japanese goods for both their quality and
price. This is particularly true in electronics.

increase fromjust several
years ago.

Computers are also an area where the United
States is making ground largely because of
excellent market research. In 1992, Japan import-
ed $3.8 billion worth of U.S. computers and
electronic equipment which was an increase of
48 percent in just five years (Newsweele 4/26/93).
Even one of America’s Big Three is making

. headway in Japan’s depressed auto market.

The sale of Ford cars was up 94 percent this
January in comparison withthe same month last
year (Business Week 2/21/94). These advances,
however, are only some of the reasons why the
United States must tread lightly in dealing with
Japan.

Japan is still the leader of Asia and should be
treated with the respect clue that position. In
1992, Asia alone absorbed 29 percent of U_S,
exports. 1 _

Also of key importance is the fact that Japan’s
trade is rapidly shifting toward Asia. Between
1987-91, the proportion of Japan’s total exports
to Southeast Asia rose from 23 percent to 31 per-
cent and the economic boom in South China will
most certainly increase this figure (Newsweek
April 26, 1993). By the year 2000, Asia will
account for 33 percent of the world’s GNP (CNN
April 2, 1993).

Japan is also of key importance in dealing
with the problems on the Korean peninsula. The
United States and Japan must work together on
this issue because if it is not resolved, the entire
region of East Asia will become unstabilized It is
imperative for the United States to realize that
we have much more to gain by fostering a part-
nership with Japan than we do by inventing a
trade war.

Short Cuts

Directed by Robert Altman
Based on stories by Raymond
Carver

Starring Tom Waits, Lily Tomlin,
Annie Ross, Tim Robbins and
many others ‘

   

After seeing Robert Altman’s
Short Cuts, my viewing com-
panions and I took on the com-
plicated task of trying to ﬁgure
out which of the 12-or-so male
characters was the most despi-
cable. This was difficult not only
because Altman’s film is full of
not-so-nice guys, but also
because he doesn’t skimp on
character substance. Every
major defect, psychosis or neu-
rosis is balanced out with some-

/

thing endearing. Nobody in
Short Cuts is one-diinensional,
and that duality is thelbasic
strength of the film.

The characters are originally
Raymond Carver’s, as Short Cuts
is based on several of his stories
and a poem. Altman’s interpre-
tation of Carver involves inter-
twining plots and characters
into a diorama of Los Angeles
where rich doctors, single moth-
ers and phone—sex operators are
all reduced to human beings
relating to and manipulating
each other.

band of waitress Doreen Piggot

derful dramatic role), who

who is so self—involved that she
doesn’t notice her daughter

an excellent job playing an

The Snapper

Directed by Stephen Frears
Written by Roddy Doyle
Starring Colm Meaney

Roddy Doyle has written two plays and four nov-
els, the most recent of which, Paddy Clar/ee Ha Ha
Ha, won the 1995 Booker Prize. His first novel, The
Commitments, won him world-wide recognition and
was made into the hit film of the same name.

Now Doyle’s second novel from the Barrytown tril-
ogy, The Snapper, makes its way to celluloid;

The'Snapper is the story of the average working-
class Curley family of Dublin. Dessie (Colm Meaney)
is the hard working Dad who enjoys his friends and
his pints, and Sharon (Tina Kellegher) is his_daughter
who feels much the same way. Then the Curley fami-

ly li'fe is shocked out of balance when Sharon

becomes pregnant.

As you can probably guess, pregnancy out of wed-
lock in Catholic Ireland isn’t the most pleasant of
social situations. What’s more, Sharon won’t tell any-
one, even her beloved Da, who the father is. The
whole family suffers problems in every aspect of life
due to the embarrassment of Sharon’s dilemma. The
beauty of The Snapper is in the way the_family unites
in the face of difficulty, a Doyle specialty.

Director Stephen Frears is English-bom, but he cer-
tainly knows the Isle as well, aided by Roddy Doyle’s
Joyce-like knowledge of his people. The pub scenes
are superb, and the entire film overflows with fluid
Irish dialogue, some of it hard to grasp for us
Americans. ’

The Snapper is an antidote of sorts to In The Name
of the Father, showing the peaceful, if socially unsta-
ble, side of Ireland. Doyle’s Barrytown trilogy, The

 

Commitments, The Snapper and The Van, are really a

Duhltners for the ‘90s. They portray Dublin and its
people in all the sins and graces of their common
beauty.

‘ The books paint for us the dirty, poor, industrial
realism of Dublinwith the wit and zeal that help the
Irish to muddle through. In The Snapper, Frears has
captured all of this onfilm.

The Snapper is showing through March I 7 at the
Fulton, downtown on 6th Street. Call 4 71-9700.

Wbat’s Eating Gilbert Grape
Directed by Lasse Hallstrom
Written and based on a novel
by Peter Hedges

‘ Starring Johnny Depp, Juliette

Lewis

Gilbert Grape’s life sucks. He
lives in the town of Endora,
Iowa, population 1,091, with his
two sisters, his retarded brother
Arnie and his fantastically obese
Momma who is, as he says,
“wedged into” their small
house. Endora’s a town where
kids get excited when a couple
of mobile homes go past on the
highway, where the underem—
ployed get goose bumps over
the job opportunities at the new
Burger Barn about to be built
and where everyone, especially
Gilbert Grape (Depp), is going
nowhere 

. and this movie is NOT
going to let you forget it! In fact,
the first hour of the film seems
primarily devoted to each char-
acter repeatedly reciting the
mantra “We’re going nowhere”:
in context, out of context, in

I.As1-

any way that novelist/sCreen-
writer Peter Hedges can fit the
words in. At first, this seems

. like a good Hamletesque dis-

play of inactivity, but eventually
the whole setup becomes a
mood crowbar with which
Hedges smacks us in the face.
Gilbert Grape is a character
film, and the characters are
sometimes very good. Leonardo
DiCaprio is convincing and
likeable as Arnie, constantly try-
ing to climb up and away from
Endora and disappear, and

also enjoyable as Betty Carver,

Men's /aoops ta/ees on Pirates in season ﬁnale

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

The men’s basketball team travels to
South Orange, N.J., Saturday night to face
their Big East conference rival the Pirates of
Seton Hall in the last regular season game
of the year for both teams. The Panthers are
caught in the middle of a deplorable down-
ward slide, and if they should get swash-
buckled by the Pirates on Saturday, the
Panther losing streak would extend to eight
games.

Both the Panthers and the Pirates will
have had an entire week off to prepare for
each other. The last time these two teams
matched up was Jan. 15 at Fitzgerald Field
House and resulted in a 76-67 loss for the
Panthers. Both teams will be coming into

Saturday night’s game with identical 7-10'

records in conference play.

Pitt’s previous game, which took place
last Saturday, was a loss to Connecticut in
which the Huskies clinched first place in
the Big East with the 78-66 win over the
Panthers.

Panther center Eric Mobley is coming off
another fine performance having scored 21
points along with 15 rebounds in the losing
effort.

The Panthers came home from their loss
at Connecticut with Sunday and Monday off
and only conducted some running drills
Tuesday afternoon before resuming a regu-
lar practice schedule.

The Panthersgrabbed a 5-4 record away
from home.

Seton Hall is ﬂying high after a 70-59 vic-
tory at Big East rival Villanova in its previ-
ous game last Saturday which gave the
Pirates three wins in their last four games.
The victory gave the Pirates a 9-10 record in
the Big East and a 14-11 record overall. The
Hall has compiled a 10-4 record at home

Pitt ade grevious error in Evans contract situation

Pit News File Photo
This will be Paul Evans’ final year as Pitt's head coach.

There were rumors. There
were people in authority tap-
dancing around questions.
Finally, there is an answer.

It is the saga of Paul Evans’
future as Pitt’s head basketball
coach.

That future ends with the
month of March. We finally got
that word yesterday, as Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes said that
the university had given up try-
ing to agree on terms for a con-
tract extension.

Publicly, the negotiation that
led to that point was one offer
from the university last month.
When Evans responded with a
counteroffer specifying undis-
closed stipulations, the universi-
ty yanked its offer from the
table.

Much like everybody’s
favorite soap opera on ice, the
story does not end with the big
event — in this case the final
announcement that Evans will
not be back.

jaynes spent much of a late
afternoon press conference yes-
terday dodging accusations that
the university gave Evans an
offer he would definitely turn

down, so it would not look like
they were pushing him out.

He also refused to comment
on whether or not Pitt lost
recruits due to the delay in deal-
ing with the Evans situation.
Never mind that one prospec-
tive recruit who went elsewhere
said it was a factor.

“I can’t control what people
say and what people write,”

Jason
Brame &
Ryan
Buncher

Jaynes said. “Those things are
there. Do they damage the pro-
gram? Probably some.”

Did the handling of the Evans
situation hurt the program?
Probably a lot.

Pitt left Evans twisting in the
wind for reasons we cannot
begin to understand. The failure

to make a decision before the
season started cost the program
much of the credibility which
had already been damaged
when it made sweeping
changes in the athletic depart-
ment last summer. Former
administrators Dean Billick and’
John Blanton were dismissed in
what jaynes called a restructur-
ing of the athletic department.

Evans’ situation is now the
second incident of a former
head coach leaving on bad
terms.

A strong argument can be
made that Oval Jaynes is a qual-
ity athletic director who does
what is necessary to win.

The question is, however, will
the lack of stability keep quality
employees away from Pitt?

jaynes said yesterday that he

thinks Pitt is an attractive place-

to come to. With an unstable
conference and a recent history
of controversial treatment for
outgoing employees, that attrac-
tiveness isn't what it used to be.

Jason Brame is the sports edi-
tor and Ryan Buncber is the
asst. sports editor for The Pitt
News.

By Dan Lauso
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

Being named a team captain
is one of the highest honors that
can be bestowed upon a player
by a head coach.

But along with being a team
captain comes a great responsi-
bility. Teammates and coaches
expect leadership, a good
example to be set for others and
most importantly, victories. It
takes a special type of person to

_ be a team captain. The Pitt

Panther wrestling team has
found such a person in John
Richey.

Richey has been one of the

steadiest members of Pitt’s
wrestling program this season.
Richey has rolled-up an impres-
sive season record of 18-6 so far
this year.

Richey, a sophomore, does
not back down from the high
expectations his coaches and
teammates have thrust upon
him. i

“The team looks to me for vic-
tories right now,” Richey said.

The 21-year-old Connellsville
native has been winning
wrestling matches long before
his impressive career at Pitt
started.

While attending Connellsville
High School, Richey "placed"

three times during his scholastic
career.

Many colleges came calling
for Richey’s wrestling services.
Schools such as West Virginia,
Penn State and North Carolina
tried to recruit Richey, but he
chose Pitt.

“I chose Pitt because it’s close
to home and I had fun when I
visited [on a recruiting trip]
here,” Richey said.

Richey is planning on major-
ing in business while here at
Pitt. It’s a good major for Richey
as it helps explain his busi-
nesslike approach to competi-
tion.

competitor and he ﬁghts hard,”
head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said.

Richey credits his coaches in
junior high school as having the
most profound influence on
him.

Wrestling this season with a
full face mask due to an injury
sustained early in lghe season to
his nose seemed to hamper
Richey’s wrestling performances
only slightly. Richey however,
paints a little different picture of
wrestling with the mask on.

“I hated it. It cut down on my
peripheral vision and made it
hard for me to breathe” Richey
said.

Quickness, tenacity and hard
work have allowed Richey to
dominate the 134 lbs. division
this season.

“He’s a good student, and he’s
a good kid,” Stottlemyer said.

“He’s got a great defense, and
he’s a hard worker.”

After a match, how does the
average wrestler choose to relax
in their free time?

If you asked around, you’d
probably find a wide range of
activites such as reading, taking

in a movie or spending time .

with a sweetheart or
friends.

“After a match I like to watch
television and play with my pet
python,” Richey said.

That’s right, the man has a pet
snake.

Many might find his choice of
pets a bit strange, but if it works
for him, who’s to argue?

After all, Richey’s on pace to
be one of the cornerstones for
the Panther wrestling teams in
the future.

“I just have to keep working
hard,” he said.
