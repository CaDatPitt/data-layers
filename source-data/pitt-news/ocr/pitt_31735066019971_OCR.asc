Jewish leaders condemn T.V

By Pete Brasko Ill
Staff Writer '

City councilwoman Sophie Masloff
and local Jewish leaders are
condemning a highly controversial
television program that was aired this
past weekend by Pittsburgh's Chan-
nel 21.

The program, A Glimpse of Islam,
which aired twice a day on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday, was a

‘monologue by Mustafa Ali, a local

television producer and a Moslem.

During the program, Ali charged
that Jewish rabbis had ”perverted
God's law” and claimed that Jews

believe ”a Gentile girl who is 3 ‘years
old can be violated.”

Ali also claimed thatJews think that
all non-Jews are whores, that it is per-
missible for Jews to rob or steal from

Christians, and that non-Jews are

”nothing but cattle, dumb beasts.”

”What this person saidlwas just
revolting,” said city Councilwoman
Sophie Masloff. ”The remarks were
in bad taste. The program was bad -

everything about it was bad.

”You have to remember that this
program was aired on the public ac-

_cess channe|,” she said. ”And we

have a person [at the TV station]
who's supposed to screen out
anything that may be libelous,

obscene or slanderous, and yet this
program slipped by.”

David Conti, executive director of
PCTV who is the person responsible
for screening out any libelous,
obscene or slanderous material, said
that Alihas had a program on the air
for 18 months, and this is the first
time that the program has drawn
severe criticism.

”You have to remember that I am
not in thebusiness of censoring,”
said Conti. ”Here at the public access
station our job is to provide a forum
where anyone in the community who
wants to can air viewpoints on things.
Our job is to promote diversity of
viewpoints.”

. show

Conti also said that in the eight
years the station has been in ex-
istence, more than 4,000 people
have used the station's facilities and
equipment, free of charge, to air pro-
grams. He saidthat any Pittsburgh

‘resident who is interested in replying

to the program A Glimpse of Islam
should Contact him at 322-7570, and
arrangements will be made for them
to do 50.

Ali was not available for comment.

Conti also said he does not feel that
the program violated any of PCTV’s
programming guidelines, which pro-
hibit obscene or indecent material
and libelous or slanderous

reports on
steelwo rke rs

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Since 1950, there has been a
steady and terrifying decline in the
economic conditions in the Mon
Valley area of Pittsburgh.

During the worldwide recession
among the heavy industries in 1980,
these communities were some of the
hardest hit in the nation.

In a rare inter-departmental effort
between the School of Social Work
and the political science department,
a study of the economic conditions
and public_opinions of the residents
in the areas of high unemployment
has been compiled.

The report, funded through the
Pittsburgh Foundation with assistance
from Pitt, is being directed by David
E. Epperson and Jim Cunningham.

Epperson, in his opening remarks
for the study, said, ”The report spells
out the tragic loss and unemployment
chaos which has struck the river com-
munities, and at the same time
reveals the great residual strengths [of

"the people]/’

Throughout the individual pieces

of the study, the residents’ commit-~ T

ment to their communities was an
island of stre_ngth in the economic
storm.

Dr. David Biegel, the co-investiga-
tor for the portion of the study
focused on the Duquesne area, spoke
of the pride felt by a large number of
-the residents in a positive as well as
negative context. ”The people of the
communities can withstand a lot of
adversity with their pride. V
However, the same feelings can pre-
vent people from seeking help when
they really need it. Overall, the con-
fidence the people have in
themselves and their neighborhoods
can have a very positive effect.”

-Dr. Michael Margolis, the investi-
gator for the Braddock area, mirrors
Biegel’s findings in his report. ”When

"asked to rate their hometowns, 41

percent chose ’good place to live’ 
while only 11 percent said ‘not a
good place to live.’ ”.

The residents of these communities
often own their own homes and have
lived in the areas for more than 30
years.

pects for the different areas under

study, James Cunningham, the prin-

Reagan says “No” to spy swap;Warns Soviets

DENVER —~ President Reagan
vowed not to trade accused Soviet
spy Gennady Zakharov for reporter
Nicholas Danil-off Monday and warn-
ed the Soviets to release Daniloff im-
mediately. Daniloff, a reporter for

. U.S. News and World Report, was ar-

rested in Moscow 10 days ago after
accepting a sealed envelope from an
acquaintance. The Soviets said the
envelope contained documents
marked ”top secret” and photos of
Soviet military installations, while
Daniloff said he thought the package
contained old newspaper clippings.
State Department sources said the ar-
rest of Daniloff was in retaliation for
the American detention of a Soviet
physicist, Gennady Zakharov,
allegedly caught trying to sell defense
secrets to undercover agents. Reagan,
speaking at a fundraiser in Denver,
said if the Soviets do not immediate-
ly release Daniloff, ”there is no way

J  to prevent thisincident from becom-
.. ' ingamajorobstaclein ourrelations.”
. V Reagan would not say, however,

whether a second superpower sum-
mit is in jeopardy because of the in-
cident, but administration sources
hint it may not be. Sources did say
that a planned cultural exchange in
Latvia may be in jeopardy.

     

Japan joins Star Wars

TOKYO — The Japanese govern-
ment announced Monday it is join-
ing the Star Wars defense program.
Japan is the last major U.S. ally to do
so. Defense Ministe_r Yuko Kurihara
said Japan's private firms and public
institutions will soon be participating
in Star Wars research, and participa-
tion in Star Wars is in line with
Japan's policy of seeking stable rela-
tions between East and West. The an-
nouncementdrew severe criticism
from opposition leaders and anti-
nuclear groups, who charge the
movelwill putjapan in the arms race.
Japanese officials said though, that
they believe Star Wars is designed
”ultimately to eliminate all nuclear
weapons.” Japan is the world's only
nation to suffer an atomic attack. The
United States already has agreements
on Star Wars research with Great Brit-
am’ and West Germany.

Pakistan frees Bhutto

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The
Pakistani government released op-
position leader Benazir Bhutto and
hundreds of supporters Monday from

UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL

a jail just outside Karachi. Govern-
ment officials warned though that
they would not tolerate further
unrest. Bhutto and many of her sup-
porters were arrested 26 days ago
after large protests and some acts of
civil disobedience. Bhutto vowed not
to abandon her drive to overthrow
President Mohammad Zia u|—Haq
though, and said she hopes to bring
about elections in the mostly Moslem
country soon. Zia seized power in a
1977 military coup in which he
ousted Bhutto's father, the late prime
minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who Zia
later had hanged.’

Tutu shows visitors
slum areas

CROSSROADS, South Africa —
Just one day after his installation as
the first black Anglican archbishop of
Cape Town, Desmond Tutu guided
selected guests through one of the
country's poorest slums: Crossroads.
Accompanying Tutu on the trek were

the Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Muncie and the wife of slain civil
rights activist Martin Luther King,
Coretta Scott King. Muncie said he
was ”horrified to walk through the
dirt and squalor and smell.”

Contra leader says

‘training in U.S.

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — The
military commander of the largest
Contra fighting force said Nicaraguan
rebels probably will be trained in the
United States. Enrique Bermudez told
reporters he would like to have the
training of the rebels conducted in-
side Nicaragua, but the United States
is the most likely training sight. Con-
gress has approved a $100 million
aid package to the Contras, who are
trying to overthrow the leftist regime
of Sandinista. The aid package calls
for U.S. military personnel to work
with the rebels, though details have
yet to be ironed out. President
Reagan has repeatedly tried to sup-
port the rebels, mostly with
”humanitarian aid,” though the aid
package which Congress approved
will contain funds earmarked for
training the rebels. One U.S.

diplomat has already said that one
possible type of training for the rebels
would be to have U.S. experts give
specialized training to rebel leaders,
and then have those leaders provide
basic training for recruits.

Chile cracks down on

opposition to leader
 

SANTIAGO, Chile -— The military
government of Augusto Pinochet
declared a state of siege Monday and
began arresting hundreds of opposi-
tion supporters, including two
American Roman Catholic priests.
The government also banned news
dispatches from Chile by the Reuters
News Agency and closed six opposi-
tion news magazines. The
crackdown comes on the heels of an
assassination attempt on Pinochet
Sunday, that killed five of his _per-
sonal bodyguards. Pinochet, who
took over the Chilean government
nearly 13 years ago by forming a
coup against socialist leader Salvador,
Allende, said, ”the government has
enough support to do whatever it
wants.” The Reagan administration
has yet to comment on Pionochet’s
crackdown.

Zeta Beta Tau begis reorganization

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

Zeta Beta Tau is beginning a
reorganization. Fifteen young men at-
tended a meeting Monday night to
express interest in the new fraternity.

Alumni and national chairman
Gregory Lynn headed the meeting.
Lynn began recruiting at the
freshmen Student Activities Fair, us-
ing a method of rush that was dif-
ferent from the typical fraternity
method. ‘

”lt's a very informal rush,” said
Lynn. "It's called reorganizing, and

P we'll be rushing informally all year.”

Lynn is working with various alum-
ni of ZBT. It was the local alumni
who first voiced dissatisfaction with
the former ZBT fraternity. They call-
ed the Nationals, who then sent Lynn
here to begin the reorganization.

Freshmen Michael Barry saw Lynn
at the Activities Fair. He was in-
trigued by the idea of starting a new
fraternity, so he got together some of
his friends who were also interested.

"Some of us know each other,”
said freshman Michael Newman at
the meeting. ’’I came with a group of
friends. We took the first step, but all
of us initiated will be the founding
fathers.”

ZBT ”Founding Fathers” (from left) Michael O'Brien, Michael Neuman, Paul Abrams, Michael Pomerantz and Michael
Barry discuss plans for new chapter.

freshmen access to the former ZBT
house on University Drive. The
reorganized fraternity will regain the
house in the fall of '87.

'’It will be difficult,” said freshman
Michael Pomerantz, ”but we'll
manage, and next year we'll be
stronger with the house. We have to
build up a foundation first.”

Freshman and founder Michael

O'Brien agrees. "Given the two
semesters to organize, we'll be
stronger next year."

The new fraternity is going to be
entirely separate from the former ZBT
brothers who have been given alum-
ni status.

"They have all the rights and
privileges of alumni,” said Lynn, ”but
they do not have the power to make

decisions as to what the new brothers
will do.”

Christopher Sepesy is a senior and
a former ZBT brother. Sepesy said
that their being closed down was due
to an accumulation of problems over
the year. "lt's actually confidential,
and I think it should be left that way.

'’It was a national decision,
though,” said Sepesy. "Some people

were upset, and I'm sure they stil|‘are,

- but in order for ZBT to remain and 
thrive, this is for the best. There
would have been too much bad.-if
blood, and it would have taken a 

long time to rejuvenate."

Alumni status has been given to all _ 
the former brothers, and Sepesy has  4;,

The Space Shuttle:
 Are we ready yet?

It's been seven months since the space shuttle Challenger disaster.
Seven months that have brought serious doubts regarding NASA’s
ability to launch another space craft safely.

Since the beginning of 1986, there have been six failed space mis-
sions, including Challenger. This has been a terrible year for the space
program; seven people have been killed, billions of dollars have been’
dumped into the sea, and the American people have lost confidence
about the feasibility of space travel. Lost confidence could very well
turn into lost revenue for NASA. NASA desperately needed to score
a major public relations coup. _

On Friday, Sept. 5, 1986, they did it. A supposedly secret Delta
rocket loaded with equally secret Star Wars satellites took off from
the Kennedy Space Center. The flight was carried out flawlessly. The
rocket functioned exactly according to plans, and the experiments
it facilitated were also a success. Officials hope that this latest per-

I 7 . formance will regain lost confidence and bring an end to their trou-

bled times. While it's doubtful that NASA would ever go under -
after all it is a federal agency — the Delta flight should bring in some
extra income from aerospace contractors and other private firms that
are preparing for the space program to get back in high gear.

So it looks as if the tough times are over for NASA. _But wait. NASA
has alot more to do toclean a tarnished public image than to get
one rocket off the ground correctly out of seven ' attempts. It's
understandable that they are in~a hurry to get back to business, but
they should never forgetthe mistakes they've made this year. It seems
as if the space shuttle tragedy was caused by pressure to "get that
thing in the air, to hellwith the risks.” That's an admirable attitude
in some cases, but not when human lives, billions of dollars and na-
tional pride are sitting on a launch pad.

The next space shuttle flight has been delayed for at least two years.
That's some time in which to make some adjustments, but it's not
enough. In late August, NASA officials announced the plans for
modified rocket joints on the shuttles. The new design has in fact
been around for a few years. In the rush to make shuttle flights as
common as air travel, this ”new" design must have been overlooked.

. It would have taken time and money to make the change earlier, and

no one thought that the design they were using could cause a pro-
blem. They learned their lesson the hard way. So now the new rockets
will have three O-rings instead of two, a metal capture latch to keep
the joints more securely fastened to each other during the stresses
of takeoff and heaters that will be strapped to the rockets to keep
the rings malleable during cold weather. Now they have a better ver-
sion of the same rocket. Is that honestly going to make the whole
process safer? Would it not be better to redesign the entire rocket
from the bottom up? Proposalshave been made to build a seamless
rocket. The joints where the seams meet are where the problem lay
with Challenger. Could the same thing happen again, even though
the joints are more secure? This new rocket is a mere modification,
not an improvement. NASA has an $8 billion budget this year; sure-

’ ly someone can build a better rocket with that kind of money floating

around.

NASA is down, but they are by no means out. Their problems,
however, are nearing a crisis. They may have to lay off 25,000
employees and contract workers next year due to budget restrictions

. and grounded rockets. President Reagan has promised to allocate the

$2.8 million necessary to build a new shuttle, but that will take at
least three years to complete. Times look tough, and they are.

Instead of twiddling their thumbs and begging for more funding
until the next shuttle is ready, they should use this time to their ad-
vantage. The Delta success is a step in the right direction. NASA
should pour all of their available resources into the Delta program
until the shuttles are ready. They don't seem to be doing that, though.
There are only five Delta takeoffs scheduled for the next three years.
That's not enough. They're perfect for the jobs that have to be done.
They're comparatively inexpensive (only $42 million per rocket), and
they're unmanned, meaning that no more human lives have to be
risked until the shuttles are back. They could prove to be a better
alternative to manned craft. Why is it so necessary to h_ave people
in space when it is so dangerous in the first place?

The time has come to seriously reconsider our objectives for a space
program. We must be willing to sacrifice a little pride and sit out the
next few rounds to lick our wounds.

A cynical lookat the wisdom
of enforcing a dry rush policy

Hey, let's all thank the Office of
Student Activities! These brave, car-
ing and supremely competent people
have, in their wisdom, seen fit to
undertake the task of shaping my
morals. Since I am not 21 years of age
I should not be consuming alcoholic
beverages, therefore the OSA
benevolently makes it as hard as
possible for me to acquire alcohol.
I want to thank them for this, and I
have called my parents and told them
how immoral and wrong they were
for allowing me to consume alchohol
in my own home. You see, my par-

ents are from the old, immoral,-
booze-swilling country of Portugal."

Their belief was that if I had it
available to me, I would not be so
anxious to abuse it. Of course, I did
abuse it and have-just returned from
Skid Row. I guessithat by giving the

LETTERS

fraternities the ”option” of having a
dry rush this fall, the OSA is going to
mold the morals of the ”misguided,
drunken fraternity guys.” Hey, wait
a minute, but how do these "drunks
accomplish anything such as school,
sports and community work? Well,
I'll say one thing, those unfortunate
people that received our blood, prob-
ably caught a great ”buzz" during

. their operations. And that money we
rai‘sed,'we||, we all got drunk and
held up a string of 7-11 stores. We
are such slime buckets!

My fraternity wanted to have mud
wrestling as one of its rush_ functions
but that was too immoral. When we
questioned the pudding wrestling in

the ”quad" during ”Spring Fling," we
realized that mud is much dirtier than
pudding. I guess that must have been
the OSA’s reasoning because they
would never use a double standard!
Boy do they care about the Greeks,

they must really love us!!

Finding true honor in students

Once in a high Cathedral tower
there was a paradise known as the

Honors Center. Here in its lounge ‘

some of Pitt's finest students came to
discuss Reaganomics, Kaﬂ<a and SDI
without having to behave condesend-
ingly social. Here one could behave
in any unpredictable manner, wear
any style clothing and speak in any
language that best conveyed ideas or
feelings, all without the fear of being
unjustly frowned upon’ or stared at for
more than a second. The free-
thinking atmosphere brought out the
best of many students who were not
intimidated to use their gift of a good
human mind.

Then came winds of change that
nurtured the Honors Center to grow
into the Honors College, to be of-
ficially opened next semester. With
this new college will come greater
opportunities for
challenge themselves academically
and to be recognized for above-
average scholastic acomplishment,
not to mention greater prestige for the
University of Pittsburgh as an out-
standing educational institution.

Yet with these positive changes
came concern and dissension from
those in the Honors Program who
most appreciated the social and in-
tellectual freedom that blossomed in-
side the lounge. They had fears that
with the establishment of the new
Honors College would also come
from the Honors administration
restraints on behavior and strong re-

students to-

MATT T_OI.BERT

quests to "tone down" discussions,
to avoid strong language and to ”put
on a good show." -

A few concerned students went as
far as to publish a small satirical
newspaper titled the Little-Harvard
Lampoon which not only lambasted
the Honors Center's administrators
but cited that the original goals of en-
couraging free thought and behavior
were being left behind in the drive
for an Honors College.

One Lampoon editor wrote, ”The
honorwithin the Honors Program for
me was found in the mutual trust and
respect I could find within the com-
munity that frequented the place,
both at the personal and academic
level. The intellectual and personal
integrity of the people and the ideas
nurtured there were what brought the
place honor.

"As the Honors Program has begun
its transition into a college, I've
noticed a trend away from this notion
of honor.  It would be a shame to
see the community, the spirit which
binds us to this place, sacrificed to the
accolades which it has brought upon
itself."

If this "honor,” risen from that
lounge in the Cathedral, an honor not
found consistently anywhere else on
campus, is truly dissipating, it is not

necessarily the fault of the winds of
change coming from the administra-
tors doing the blowing.

The academic and personal
freedom that existed — and still ex-
ists —— was due not to a room or a pro-
gram but due to all the honors
students who respected the personal
integrity of other students and instruc-
tors. These students were unintimi-
dated to talk intellectually without the
fear of facing scorn for being "too
smart" and were willing to open
themselves and make friends among
other students. This attitude formed
the special community that inhabits
the Honors Center's lounge.

If honors students let
understanding — that they alone are
responsible forthe honor — slip away
from their conscience, then the
Honors Center will merely become
another university administration of-
fice with a coffee machine made
available to students.

The first step to prevent such a
travesty has already been taken:
Students have voiced their legitimate
concerns both vocally and through
the Lampoon. What needs to be ac-
complished now is to continue to
introduce new students to the special
social atmosphere of the Honors
Center so that the freedom and honor
persists and to make sure the ”old
guard” students never allow
themselves to let the old honors
Camelot fade into the mists of time
and change. '

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, I986.

Q. It was strictly friendship, no hint
of romance, love or sex for four full
years and then my male pal decided
that sex with a nice sensible girl like
me would be just the thing. Now
how am I going to tell him sex is not
what I want with him, or that he isn't
what I want with sex? I don't want to
bust his ego or hurt his feelings.

A. Or lose that friendship, right?
But there is little you can do, the truth
being the truth. You can write him a

sensible letter, friendly but not i

phony, and tell him that after being
friends with him for so long you are
hooked on it. Say you have to feel
complimented but you want to go on
being friends with him while you
both look for whatever life holds.

And then call him up and suggest
you do whatever you usually do with
him — go to a movie, stop at a bar
afterwards, whatever. Avoid [a] long,
talking-out of this issue because it can
only keep it alive. Let it be just a
memory that fades. Try it.

Q. My dorm friends and I are all

virgins and glad you have been giv-
ing us. moral support about not giv-
ing in to pressure and not feeling
freaky. But we are full of curiosity.
What is an orgasm like? And do we
have to masturbate or have ex-
perience now to have orgasms later
on?

A. Absolutely not, to that last ques-
tion. When the time comes, just relax
and have a great time. Masturbating
is harmless, sometimes instructive,
but not required. An orgasm is a
reflex, a contraction of the uterus and
vagina, which some women do feel
and some don't. Many who don't feel
it at first can develop the ability to feel
it as a pleasant experience.

It can be mild or intense, and
should be taken as it comes. You
have probably heard it compared to
a sneeze. Some sneezes just happen,
or they don't build up or amount to
much, and others follow two or three
involuntary intakes of breath and
come as a thrill of release, with a
resolution period afterwards. An

WESTHEIMER

orgasm is usually more pleasurable
and intense, but much like that.
Q. I'm 19, my girlfriend is 16 and
not allowed to have males in the
house while her mother is working
3 p.m. to midnight. Well, her mother
caught me there and went-into a
screaming rage, and now my girl isn't

 

supposed to see me at all, and we
have to sneak, which I resent. We
weren't doing anything. In fact, we
have never had sex, but ifl phone to
explain, her mother hangs up.

A. At 16 that girl is young. Natural-
ly her mother is concerned and
makes rules about when she is out
making a living. If this hard-working
mother is unreasonable, remember,
she let you see the girl before you
broke her rule. Give this some time;
mothers have been known to relent
in their objections.

‘If she won't listen to you, try to get
someone in that family — your girl's

' aunt or cousin? — to point out that

you and your girl have never been in-
timate, and to break a rule but do no
harm is very minor. If she remains op-
posed to you, then you just have to
wait, but keep up the gentle persua-

sion- because it has worked many

times before this.

Q. My husband wants to start a
family, but I'm not ready for the
responsibility. I stopped using the pill

I What to dowhen your hubby goes wandering

because it disagreed with me, and
now he won't cooperate in con-
traception. This is hard on me
because I want to have sex, too. Is the
sponge a good method? I can't go to
a doctor to get a diaphragm; the idea
makes me too nervous.

A. You should go to Planned
Parenthood and have a good discus-
sion with someone there. Do explain
your whole problem. They will listen.
Maybe they can find a woman doc-
tor for you or help you somehow to
overcome your nervousness about
seeing a gynecologist. If you can't ac-
cept the idea of the diaphragm, a doc-
tor may be able to prescibe a different
pill that won't disagree with you.

The sponge is a method without
enough of a track record for reliabili-
ty, and some doctors won't prescribe
it because there is a danger of toxic
shock for women who use it. You do
need to be in control of the con-
traception in your situation, because
you should not be pressured into hav-
ing a baby until you are ready.

Money makes Amazing Randi our latest genius

A $272,000 grant? I had never
worked with a genius, although I
once interviewed Vanna White.

But now I must revise my thinking.
It turns out that at one point in my
life I did indeed work — and work
very closely —— with a man who has
”officially” been declared a genius.

The man is James Randi, known as
the Amazing Randi. As you may have
read, Randi, 58, was recently a-
warded a fellowship by the MacAr-
thur Foundation — a so-called
”genius grant” for $272,000. The
grants are given by the foundation to
men and women with exceptional
skills and talents.

Randi is a magician by trade, but
the MacArthur Foundation gave him
the award for something else he does.

Randi loves to debunk psychics, cIair— '

voyants, faith healers and others who
defraud the public with their claims
of supernatural powers. Randi goes
around explaining to peoplejust how
the psychics, clairvoyants and faith
healers work their trickery —— and the
MacArthur Foundation thought his
work was important enough that they

Do you remember? Demonstrations at Berkeley  

Editor's note: The following col-
umn is part of The Pitt News
”Flashback” series. It was published
on Friday, Jan. 8, 1965. The writer
was News Editor Allan Schlosser. The
column refers to the student unrest
at the University oflCalifornia at
Berkeley. Because there have been
rallies right here at Pitt and recent ad-
ministrative decisions made without
student consent, this column was
chosen. The Pitt News welcomes
responsible comment on columns
reprinted in the ”Flashback” series.
All responses must be type-written
and the name and phone number of

for it to be published.

The current trend of student apathy
may or may not be a reality. In part,
that is the reason the ”Flashback”
series was established. Only students
can prove or disprove claims of
apathy. In this column, students at
Berkeley certainly disproved the
claim of apathy. It is time for students
at this university,*21 years later, to
show more concern for matters
affecting their everyday life, matters

gave him the grant.

So the Amazing Randi is a genius
now. Who would have guessed it?

When I first ran into the Amazing
Randi, we were on the road as the
only two non-musicians who played
roles in the stage show of the Alice
Cooper rock and roll band. On that
Christmastime tour, Randi portrayed
an executioner who, using a
guillotine, appeared to chop off Alice
Cooper's head every night. I played
Santa Claus, and I was beaten up by

.the band at the climax of each even-
ing's performance.

There wasn't all that much for the
Amazing Randi and me to do until
our parts of the show arrived, so dur-
ing each performance we would sit
on an equipment trunk hidden
behind an amplifier on the stage.
Randi carried packages of cotton with
him, and he always insisted that both
.of us put cottonballs in our ears dur-

ing the performances so that the

band's renditions of ”I’m Eighteen”
and ”School’s Out” wouldn't deafen
us.

Randi was a good traveling com-_

that won't disappear if ignored.
The series is designed to compare
issues and events students had 20
years ago with problems that Pitt
students currently face. To com-
memorate the university bicenten-
nial, The Pitt News will frequently
reprint columns from past issues.

During the last several months, the
University of California at Berkeley
has been the scene of widespread
discontent. The Berkeley upheaval,
although ignited by the question of
free speech (specifically, the right to
espouse any cause and to guarantee
immunity from university disciplinary
action for off-campus disobedience),
remains primarily an intra-university
power struggle, in which students
and faculty alike are revolting against
a nearly omnipotent administration.

It must be emphasized that this
crisis is not simply the product of
undergraduate frustration or
restlessness. There is far more to the
Berkeley incident than the
demagogic rantings of a Mario Savio
or the ubiquity of beards, sandals and

, Occasionally we would have dinner
together before a show, and he

life as a globe-circling magician.

guitars. It must be remembered that
the Berkeley faculty overwhelming-
Iy endorsed, point by point, the
reform proposals of the free speech
movement. During the student strike,
large numbers of graduate assistants
and professors cancelled their classes
as a gesture of sympathy for the ar-
rested demonstrators.

In short, the conflagration at

Berkeley represents a rather violent

reaction to excessive power of the ad-
ministration and the board of regents.
The Berkeley administration, not
unlike the administrations of other
American universities, is too often in-
fluenced by reactionary pressure out-
side the university and is generally
out of touch with the opinions of
students and faculty members. When
Clark Kerr, president of the Univer-
sity of California, remarked that ”the
’mu|tiversity’ is a confusing place for
the student,” he should have added
that it is perplexing to the ad-

Syracuse, N.Y., our limousines ar-
rived at the airport only to find a
chain-link fence with a locked gate
standing between us and our
chartered jet. We had no idea how
to get through, and then someone
thought of the obvious answer —- we
should turn to the.Amazing Randi.

Randi got out of one of the cars and
approached the gate. ”Make the
fence disappear, Randi,” yelled Den-
nis Dunaway, one of the guitar
players.

Randi started fooling with thelock.
No luck. Alice Cooper got out of his
car to supervise. Still, Randi held the
lock in his hands and was unable to
spring it.

”Guess he's just not feeling amaz-
ing today,” one of the band members
said.

Another band member said, ’’If we
put him in a straitjacket and hand-
cuffed his arms behind his back and
locked him upside down in a tank of
water, he'd get out. But he can't do
a padlock in broad daylight.”

Eventually we made it to the plane
through a more conventional method

ministrator as well. For when con-
fronted with demonstrations,
panic-striken Berkeley administrators
over-responded with an ill-advised
call to Governor Pat Brown.

What was most alarming, however,
was the board of regents’ report of
Dec. 18 in which the faculty was
relegated solely to the teaching posi-
tion. According to the regents, the ad-
ministration, not the faculty, is
charged with the responsibility of
formulating academic policy (e.g.,
the curriculum and academic free-
dom). It is only natural, given such
a milieu, that the faculty should pro-
test the usurpation of its legitimate
powers.

Some 40 years ago, economist
Thorstein Veblen wrote an essay in
which he warned about the dangers
inherent in the American board of
trustees concept. He argued that such
a governing body, composed large-
ly of business executives, represented
a threat to faculty sovereignty and
free expression. The Berkeley erup-
tion, and there will be similar erup-

Read The Pitt News

—- an airport maintenace truck ar-
rived, and a workman used a key to
unlock the gate. It took several cities
for the Amazing Randi to live that
one down.

In the years since that rock tour,
Randi has taken pleasure in exposing
the tricks of Uri Geller (Randi per-

forms the same ”miracIes,” then pro-'

ceeds to tell audiences exactly how
he did it.) And he has popped up on
the couch next to Johnny Carson a
number of times. As Randi told a
reporter after winning the MacArthur
Foundation award: ”The difference

between (psychics) and me is that I .

admit I'm a charlatan. They don't.
They hurt people. I can't allow that
to happen.”

So now the ‘Amazing Randi has
been given the $272,000 ”genius
grant,” along with the encourage-

ment to continue ‘his work. I wish ,

I him all the best for his continued suc-
cess, and I ask him one last good-
natured question.

Randi, if you're such a genius, why
couldn't you get that airport gate to

tions elsewhere, may well signal the
beginning of a student-faculty cam-
paign to regain their traditional rights.

The function of a university ad-
ministration, as Paul Goodman has
stated, should be ”to expedite the
essential academic business of
teaching and |earning.” Its immediate
responsibilities should be of a clerical
and maintenance nature, while on a
long-range basis it should be con-
cerned with fund-raising, physical ex-
pansion and thelike. In academic
matters, however, the faculty must
play more than an advisory role. In-
deed, the faculty —— and the faculty
alone —— must control what it teaches
and how it teaches. .

Although civil disobedience may
have been too extreme an alternative
in the Berkeley situation, the strike re-
mains a legitimate exercise in student
and faculty rights.

One can only hope that administra-
tions, be they in Berkeley or Pitts-
burgh, will in the future respect and
consult the other two branches of the
university community.

Elderly to benefit
from new program

By Melaine'Minch
For The Pitt News

In April of 1987, senior citizens
will be able to participate in a new
program called ”Living at Home,”
provided by Montefiore Hospital in
Oakland. The goal of the program is
to assist elderly people in the Pitts-
burgh area, so that they can live at
home rather than in institutions.

Montefiore Hospital, the leading
agency in this program, has just been
awarded a three-year, $341,000 grant
which will take effect in October of
this year. Coordinators began plan-
ning the program eight months ago,
and finally received approval after an
extensive review process.

The ”Living at Home” program
will provide services for senior
citizens who live in Oakland, Squir-
rel Hill, Greenfield, Hazelwood and
Terrace Village. The focus is primarily
on those who are at a high risk of
being institutionalized because of
handicapping accidents, heart attacks
or strokes, and those who have just
been discharged from institutions and
need to adjust to a new environment.

Michael Blackwood, assistant ad-

ministrator at Montefiore, said, ’’I
would like the ‘Living at Home’ pro-
gram to be an intergenerational pro-
gram that will take advantage of the
ethnicity in Pittsburgh neighbor-
hoods.”

Blackwood indicated that he
would like large-scale involvement in
the community. ”We would like to
provide a full treatment plan using
agencies at neighborhood levels,
community workers and volunteers,”
he said.

Services that will be provided by
this program include household
chores, shopping, transportation,
Meals on Wheels and Lifeline
systems for emergencies.

The coordinators of the program
said they are excited for it to begin.
Irwin Goldberg, Montefiore presi-
dent, said, ’’It is gratifying to be in-
volved in a project aimed at
demonstrating the effectiveness of a
controlled model of community-
based support.”

As April draws closer, more infor-
mation about the ”Living at Home"
program will be circulating around
the community through hospitals,
churches and related agencies.

’’It’s high time to lower
cholesterol,’’ is the theme for the
American Heart Association Food
Festival, Sept. 7-13.

During that week, grocery shop-
pers across the nation will receive
heart-healthy nutrition tips while
shopping at their local supermarkets.

Cholesterol intake, a primary risk
factor for heart disease, is the overall
focus of the festival, according to the
local chapter of the AHA.

The University of Pittsburgh's
Graduate School of Public Health has
received a $300,000 grant from the
University of Minnesota and the Na-
tional Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
to study treatment options for patients
with mild hypertension.

The focus of the eight—year ”Treat-
ment of Mild Hypertension” study is
to determine if the best treatment for
mild hypertension is lifestyle
modification with medication or
lifestyle modification alone.

The study is the third major study

has been awarded in recent years; the

”Systolic Hypertension in Elderly Per-
sons” study.

Dr.Robert H. McDonald is the prin-
cipal investigator of the TOMHS and
SH EP studies, while Dr. Arlene Cag-
giula is the principal investigator of
the HIP study.

”There are basically two treatment
options right now for patients with
mild hypertension,” said McDonald.
”Either lifestyle modification with
medication or lifestyle modification
alone.”

According to McDonald, the ques-
tion facing investigators of mild
hypertension is: Can you treat peo-

without altering their lifestyles un-
comfortably, and can you do it
without using drugs?

”Drugs cost money,” said
McDonald, ”and oftentimes people
can run up a fairly large expense for
the drugs, and they aren't necessari-

' ly better off than if they had been

treated without drugs.”

McDonald, a Pitt professor of
medicine, pharmacology and epi-
demiology, said investigators will
alter participants lifestyles in three
ways: all participants will be asked
to lose 10 pounds over the course of
the study; all participants will be ask-
ed to consume no more than an
average of two ounces of alcohol a
day, (roughly equivalent to two beers
a day); and all participants will be

asked to increase their exercise to the
equivalent of burning off 600 kilo-
calories a week (the equivalent of
walking six miles).

All participants will receive either
a placebo or one of five drugs used
to treat hypertension. A placebo is a
”fake drug” which does not contain
any medication. According to
McDonald, this is to prevent any
power of suggestion from influencing
the study.

The patients will not know whether
they are taking the real drug or the
placebo. McDonald said thatlifa pa-
tient knew he were on medication
which would help him, this in itself,
and not necessarily the medication,
might cause the patient’s blood
pressure to fall.

NMRren

A revolutionary alternative to heart
catheterization may make the pro-
cedure painless for the estimated I
million adults and 90,000 children
who undergo the test annually.

Cardiac Evaluation Research is a
non-invasive heart catheterization
procedure currently being performed
at the Pittsburgh Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Institute in Oakland. The
NMR Institute is one of four centers
in the country which are now
performing the test.

The current method of heart
catheterization involves placing a
tube into a major artery and running
it to the heart. With CER, three-
dimensional pictures of the heart are
obtained without the insertion of
needles or tubes into the body. The
patient lies still on a table for one

ders test p

hour, during which time nuclear
magnetic resonance is used.to gain
images of the heart. NMR involves
the use of a cylindrical magnet
30,000 times more powerful than the
gravitational pull of the earth to pro-
vide images of the human body.

During the process, the magnet’s
pull on the body's hydrogen atoms
causes the nuclei to line up uniform-
ly. This allignment is then disrupted
by radio frequency bursts. After the
disruption, the nuclei relax to their
normal states. The difference in their
”relaxation time” is analyzed by a
computer, which provides an image
of the body part scanned.

Heart catheterizations are per-
formed on adults to detect abnormal
problems invalves or coronary artery
disease. The test is used on children

to detect holes in the heart or blocked
chambers.

In addition to the NMR Institute,
the University of Pennsylvania, Duke
University and the University of
California at San Fransisco are also
performing the new procedure.

I The Pittsburgh NMR Institute is one
of the largest consortiums of hospitals
and institutions in the United States
formed to explore the capabilities of
magnetic resonance imaging. Mem-
bers are the University of Pittsburgh,
Cannonsburg General Hospital,
Carnegie Mellon University, Child-
ren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh,-Eye & Ear

”When there is too much
cholesterol in the blood it is
deposited in the arteries, which
become plugged, and a heart attack
may occur,” said Lewis Kuller, M.D.,
professor and chairman of the
Graduate School of Public Health,
University of Pittsburgh.

”Cho|esterol is a soft, fatty
substance present in the blood. The
liver produces cholesterol which is
necessary for a healthy metabolism.
The problem of too much cholesterol
in the blood is usually the result of
too much cholesterol and saturated
[animal] fats in the diet,” Kuller said.

Cholesterol is found in all animal
products, while saturated fats are
found in large amounts in red meat,
whole milk and butter.

Kuller said changes in eating habits
have helped contribute to a 30.7 per-
cent decline in total heart disease
mortality rates from 1972 to 1983. ”It
is obvious that nutrition plays a vital
role in the fight against heart
disease,” he said.

”The portrayal of cultural illusion

ZBT alumnus Melvin Cohen is also
working on the reorganization. He
said that ”we as trustees voted, and
we made the decision that the former
brothers can't rejoin. It's tough to
‘determine who's good, who's
marginal and who’s bad. i mean, if
a company goes bankrupt, maybe
some of the people were good, but

Cohen said the local alumni had
been working with the local chapter
here over the last couple of years.
”Things just weren’t working out
well. There was too much emphasis
on individualism and not_ enough pull
for the common goal. Almost any
organization needs framework. We
[the alumni] felt that the desire wasn't
there.” ‘

The former ZBT president was also
caught embezzling money from the
fraternity. ”We have a bonding agen-
cy after him,” said Cohen, ”but it's
difficult because he's in another
state.” Cohen _did not know the ex-
act sum of money taken.

Lynn, the new founding members
and Cohen are all confident about the
future of the new ZBT. ”We want the
new members to be potential leaders,
to be involved in all campus ac-
tivities, not only the fraternity,” said
Cohen. ”We want people who can
work in a team, for a team and who

can lead a team. '

”l’ve sat in on some of these
meetings [forthe new members], and
I get a good feeling. You know, ifyou
meet someone one or two times, you
can tell if you like them, and I get
good vibes.”

ciple investigator for the study, said
that ”the neighborhoods have
survived very well even though eco-
nomically they are dead. The com-
munities used to be largely
self-sufficient, but if there isn't in-
tervention soon, they will die
altogether.

”We see this problem as chronic

V and long-term. The next year will be

the _most crucial to their survival.”

The residents put the blame for
their financial hardships in a number
of places, most of them on the
government and large steel com-

_ panies. There has been a huge drop

in the real incomes of the households
investigated.

Most of the declines, usually a
minimum of $4,000 per year, can be
directly traced to the underemploy-
ment of the former steel workers.

”U.S. Steel has shirked its social
responsibility to the people that it
used to employ,” Biegel said. ”They
have made the decision to act pure-
ly in the interests of capitalist motiva-
tion, in the interest of increasing
profits. They have pulled out of the
area entirely.”

Asked about the future efforts of the
groups involved in the study, Biegel
said, ”We must go from survival to
recovery. Most of the efforts so far
have been directed to survival aid —
food banks, utility assistance and the
like. We need to have a positive at-
titude and try to work for the

rebuilding of these communities.”

Of late, these ‘occurrences have

By Stefanie Frelick
For The Pitt News

A week and a half ago at Pitt's
home opener, John Rasp got his first
taste of college football, and in grand
style. The freshman punter was
chosen for the starting job in the Pan-
thers first game of the season and
soon realized that punting in a ma-
jor college game was everything he
envisioned it to be.

Kicking in front of 40,000 people
was really something,” said Rasp. ’’I
wasn't scared so much, just excited.”

Rasp was satisfied at best with his
performance against Maryland, but
felt he did OK his first time out.

Winning the punting duties for the
game was somewhat of a shot in the
arm for Rasp, since he's been battl-
ing sophomore Scott Merlack from
day one of camp for the job. The race

has been close but, according to:
Rasp, the much talked about ‘rivalry’
has in no way been a bitter one. ”All

we really do is try to help each other“

said. Also he thinks Merlack helps

team morale. ”Merle’s the funniest 

person I ever met. He's easy to get

Rasp is listed in the program as a5
punter/quarterback and, although he

to try him out at quarterback. But it

Congemi readiesfor tough Pack

By John Enright,
Assistant Sports Editor 

The Pitt Panther offense showed
some positive signs in last week's

‘10-7 loss to the Maryland Terrapins,

but the bottom line was that they put
only one touchdown on the board.

The Panthers have scored only 35
points in their last five games dating
back to last season. Pitt will have to
break out of its offensive slump to
defeat the North Carolina State
Wolfpack this weekend.

Coach Mike Gottfried made it clear

that Pitt would display a wide—open,

aerial attack against the Terrapins. ln
that game, Panther quarterback John
Congemi threw a career-high 45
passes, completing 23 for 258 yards
and one touchdown.

Congemi’s stats looked good, but

the results didn't. The offense has a

lot of improving to do, but Congemi
feelsthey are gradually jelling as a
unit. ”Our offense has come along,”
said Congemi. ”We just want to get

out there and play N.C. State. We're
looking forward to winning.”

It is that air of confidence that
vaulted the fifth—year senior into the
starting quarterback slot after a neck-
and-neck duel‘ with Sal Genilla at fall
camp. Now, Congemi just has to put
more points on the board. But how
he will do that remains to be seen.
”Whether we'll primarily run or pass
is a game—to-game thing,” com-
mented Congemi.

Understandably, the Panthers
neglected running the ball against
Maryland's tough wide—tackle six
defense. Pitt rushed for only 91 yards
and, more noticeably, junior running
back Charles Gladman carried the
ball only 10 times for 24 yards.

Things could very well be the same
against the Wolfpack Saturday. And
that doesn't bother Congemi at all. ”lt
doesn't matter to me how much we
pass,” said Congemi. ”Just as long as
we win.‘ Forty-five passes or 25
passes, it_doesn’t make a difference.”

It would appear that Pitt's passing

-.-4»'

attack would have a detrimental ef-
fect on Gladman, who rushed for
over 1,000 yards last season, but
don’t.bet on it. Gladman showed his
versatility against the Terps, catching
six passes for 78 yards. Plus, one

game doesn't show a team's true co|— .

ors. Gottfried and Congemi agree that
how things go early on in Saturday's
game will give a better indication of
how often Gladman will touch the
ball. .

”Mary|and’s defense was so tough
against the run that we couldn't
spring Gladman loose,” commented
Gottfried. ’’I think Charles will carry
the ball moreagainst N.C. State, but
I can't say for sure. He has to keep
in mind that he is a pass receiver, in
addition to being a running back, in
our offense.” .

Either way, Pitt will have its hands
full against a much—improved
Wolfpack team, which opened its
season last Saturday with a 38-10 rout
of East Carolina.

Pressure is on Van Home
new goalkeeper

By Vincent Carey
Staff Writer

Pitt soccer coach Joe Luxbacher is
forced with the big problem of hav-
ing to replace eight starters from last
year, yet he seems very optimistic
about the upcoming season. ’’I have
a fine group to work with. They try
hard and will do anything I say, but
they are inexperienced on the college
level. The people I have starting have
been on the team for a couple of
years, they just have not had the
spotlight on them,” said the coach.

"Of all the question marks on this
team, the biggest has to be the posi-
tion of goalie. For the last four years
we have had one_goalie, Dave Tor-
rence. It will be hard to replace him,
but the people we have now have

the entire second half. Although, he
saw enough to know that the
Wolfpack will provide the Panthers

worked very hard. Plus Dave has
come back to ‘help them improve,
which has been great for me and for
the team.”

This year's schedule will be a lot
tougher than last year's, due in part
to the great strides that the other Big
East teams have made. The Panthers
also play strong teams from West
Virginia and Ohio State.

It requires Pitt to be in their best
form each and every game. ”Since
we do not have one [single] player,
we will have to rely on a complete
team effort to keep from being blown
off the field by some of these teams.
Our play in the pre-season has been
very inconsistent, but if we can get
everything in sync, we have the abili-
ty to be a good team,” commented
Luxbachen

with stiff competition. ’’I thought they
were a good team. They were very
fast and physical,” said Congemi.
”lt’s going to be a good game.”

Hopefully, good for the Panthers
and not so good for the ‘Pack.

his approach steps were too large, so
the resulting follow through was bad,
too.” Nevertheless, Klausing won’t
be changing the weekly workouts,
with the exception of letting Van
Horne kick more.

With the media, fans and coaches
watching, one would naturally ex-
pect Van Home to be nervous. ’’I’m
not too nervous. It's really exciting,
a new challenge.’’ New, indeed.
Now a starter, he is still searching for
a role on the team. ’’I don't know. I
guess I'll play it by ear,” he joked,
a smile chasing across his face.

two other brothers (one of whom had

Turning serious again, Van Horne
acknowledged the supportive cheers
of his teammates. ’’It really gives me
a lift. Pat Viancourt has been very
supportive. He's taught me a lot
about the game of kicking."

Following a loss, the kicker is often
forced into the role of the team
scapegoat. ”Sometimes the fans will
forget the field goals a kicker made
during a game but remember the
gamewinner he missed," said Van
Horne. D

Coach Klausing was quick to agree,
adding that it can permanently affect
a kicker’s confidence. Klausing also
knows the extra edge a confident

One thing the soft-spoken Rasp ac-
cepts is the nature of sports. '’I
already understand that football
doesn't last forever, so it wouldn't kill
me if for some reason I couldn't go
to the pros. But that's not to say I
hope I don’t.”

He hopes to someday become an
electrical engineer. His fall schedule
of physics, chemistry,‘ calculus,
philosophy and an engineering
course, combined with football, in-
stantly provoke respect for this
1 8-year-old.

Volleyball
team visits
Colonials

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball team
is playing by the motto ”winning
breeds success.” After a challenging
tournament at Villanova, Pitt traveled
to South Orange, N.J., to face Seton
Hall and Temple. They collected two
more wins and came home with a
5-1 record.

Seton Hall, traditionally the Big
East's cellar dweller, was the first to
fall to Pitt in three quick matches,
15-3, 15-7 and 15-7. The Temple
Owls also lost to the Lady Panthers
15-5, 15-12 and 15-5. While Seton
Hall and Temple will definitely not
be Pitt's strongest competition this
season, Coach Collier noted, ”We
were able to play a lot of players who
needed to gain valuable experience.
With Lisa Stewart out, we relied on
junior Carolyn Brown and freshman
Kelly Matheis. While we are con-
cerned about Lisa's return, it was a
definite confidence booster to know
that we can win without her.
However, 1 think Lisa will play a ma-
jor factor in whether we will gain a
national ranking this season.”

Denise Frawley and Noreen
Coughlin turned in two of their
strongest performan_ces to date."
Coach Collier pointed out, ”Both
Denise and Noreen were playing
close to home. The mere presence of
family and friends provided extra
motivation for them to do well.”

Senior captain Sue Hoover had an
excellent weekend making 66 kills in
six games. This strength earned her
the Big East Athlete of the Week.
(This is a new award, and Sue is the
first athlete to receive it. All Big East
athletes are eligible, and the award
is based on performance during the
weekagainst Big East teams.)

Hoover has been coached by
Shelton Collier since she was 15,
when she was selected to play for a
Junior Olympic All-Star team. Sue
began to breed a history of success
at a very young age. The team fin-
ished in the top five for three years.
As a senior at Johnstown’s Richland
High School, Sue lead her team to a
state title. When she came to Pitt she
had already developed much of her
present style. As a sophomore here
at Pitt, Sue made the first team All Big
East conference. Last summer, Sue
suffered a broken wrist, but that
wasn't enough to keep her from earn-
ing Big East Player of the Year award.

LADY PANTHER NOTES: The
Lady Panthers play Robert Morris and
Duquesne tonight at Robert Morris
College starting at 7:30. Carolyn
Brown and Kelly Matheis will share
duties to replace the injured Lisa
Stewart.
