Occupational Deferments Given

in Additional Technical Fields

Since the December 12 release announcing the Army and Navy Training "Programs,
Selective Service bulletins sent out to local draft boards recommending occupational defer-
ment have been amended in order that there will be no discrimination between students who
enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps and those who chose to remain under the

jurisdiction of Selective Service.

In the December 12 release the deﬁnition of the phrase “approved technical engineering
courses” has since been interpreted to mean technical AND engineering courses.

These courses include all of the following
technical ﬁelds:

Engineering Fields

Aeronautical, automotive, chemical, civil,
electrical, heating, ventilating, refrigerating,
and air conditioning, industrial, marine, me-
chanical, mining and metallurgical, including
mineral technologists, radio, safety, sanitary,
transportation (air, highway, railroad,
water).

Other Specialized Fields

Bacteriologists, chemists, geophysicists,
mathematicians, meteorologists, naval archi-
tects, physicists, including astronomers, psy-
chologists.

By this amendment, industrial and sani-
tary engineers and bacteriologists have
been added. Accountants, economists, in-
dustrial managers, personnel administrat-
ors, and statisticians have been excluded.

In another Selective Service bulletin listed
as being in a “critical occupation” are “grad-
uate assistants engaged in part-time class-
room and laboratory instruction in one or
more of the following subjects for not less
than 12 hours or scientiﬁc research certiﬁed
as related to the war effort.”

Agricultural sciences, naval architecture,
astronomy, bacteriology, biology, chemistry,
dentistry, engineering sciences, geology, in-
dustrial management, mathematics, medicine
and surgery, metallurgy, meteorology, aerial
and marine navigation, oceanography, phar-
macy, physics, physiology, veterinary sci-
ences.

Army To Announce
AS TC Curricula  

Not yet announced is the curricula for the Army
Specialized Training Program, which are, at present,
being prepared and will be announced shortly. The
Navy’s Program was completed at the time of the
December 12 release.

Tentative Army curricula have been prepared by
committees of national authorities in each ﬁeld, such
committees being drawn from lists supplied by the
United States Office of Education and the Ameri-
can Council on Education through cooperation of the
professional associations

Said the American Council on Education comment-
ing on the proposed programs: “In the many con-
ferences that have been held in determining curri-
cula and administrative policies it is apparent that
these are not military programs as such, but are
educational programs to meet military needs. Consid-
erable freedom of content and entire freedom of in-
structional method will be given to the teaching
staff.”

Unlike the Navy and proposed Army Programs,
for inducted men, the plans of higher education
for the pre-induction training of freshman stu-
dents are not in general agreement. In the opinion
of the American Council of Education “there is a
wide divergency on the part of college faculties as
to what courses this period should include——some
believe it should be highly specialized pre-induc-
tion education, others that it should be general.

“There is almost complete unanimity of Army
and Navy . . . that it should develop a command of
English; provide an historical background of the
war, give a basic elementary foundation in mathe-
matics; assure physical stamina; and develop a
keeness of mind and judgment . . . The armed forces
will continue to provide the technical and specialist
training required for combat duty.”

At Pitt the above recommendation of the Army
and Navy as to what pre-induction training should
provide has been referred to Dean of the College
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford who is considering what
might be done to bring the University’s pre-induc-
tion education program into closer coordination
with the Army and Navy Specialized Training
Programs .

Reservists Urged to Register for Second
Semester by Army, Navy, Gov’t Officials

in Event of Service Call

Students’ Money Refunded

Supplementing the December l2 release an-
nouncing the Army and Navy Specialized Train-
ing Programs was a recent announcement by the
Army, Navy, and War Manpower Commission urg-
ing all students in the Enlisted Reserve Corps or
subject to Selective Service to-continue in ‘college
until called and until definite plans are developed.

Reasons given for the announcement are that adminis-
trative details of the Army and Navy Training Programs and
of Selective Service are still in the formative stage and un-
avoidable delays in putting them into operation are expected.

Exactly when enlisted reservists will be called, this latest
joint release does not say. However, an approximate date has
been set by the Army:

"By January I, l943, the War Department
will have completed its preparations to call to ac-
tive duty enlisted reserve corps students covered by
section g (7) of the Army Plan (that is, all those
not specifically deferred). These students will
thereafter begin to receive ordersto report to active
duty at designated times and places. No orders
will be given to report on a date prior to two weeks
after the completion of the student's first academic ’
quarter, term or semester terminating after De-
cember 3|, l942."

By this interpretation, a member of the Army Enlisted
Reserve Corps enrolled in a college or university in which the
current semester ended prior to December 31 can return and
is assured that he can complete the next semester.

However, if the student’s current semester ended after
January 1, 1943, he may expect to be called to active duty some
time later than two weeks after the close of the semester. For
students at the University of Pittsburgh this means any time
after February 15, 1943.

Regarding Naval Reservists, no approximate date has
been set:

“. . . careful study is now being made to determine the date
at which V-1, V-5, and V-7 reservists will be called to active
duty. Oﬁicial statements of this will be made at the earliest
possible moment as it is fully realized that the answer to this
question is of far reaching importance.”

It is possible, in view of the indeﬁniteness of the re-
spective dates of call, that a student at Pitt will be able to
ﬁnish the coming semester if he registers from February
3 to 6. In the event that a reserve student should be called
after February 15, the University is prepared to refund his
money on a weekly basis, that is, he will be charged one-
sixteenth of the total tuition for each week in class.

It has been recommended that all students when called to active
duty should take with them an oﬁicial transcript, preferably a photo-
stat copy, of their academic record.
