Singer Hits Highs & Lows  

 By Tool: ERKEL

Some people turn their heads and
hurry by, others yell out his name or
exchange pleasantries, some just
drop their spare change into his cup.

“Thank you, God bless you,” he
says in return.

Bill Dorsey sings for a living, but
unlike most singers, his audience is
anyone who happens to be on or
near Forbes Avenue at the time.

“Hi, Bill. Why don't you sing
down at the White Tower any-
more?” says a middle-aged woman
named Rosemarie.

Everyone who knows him, and
standing next to him it seems‘that
everyone does, knows him simply as
Bill or “that blind guy who sings."
Most people you find singing on the
street need only that much, they fit
the role of eccentric better without a
surname. 0

“This man's got a better voice
than Frank Sinatra," declares
another fan.

Anyone who's heard him knows
that he is a bonafide bass; as pure
and passionate a vocalist as cn be
found, curbside, stage front or
pressed onto vinyl.

While some people may think he
is a nuisance, others, whether out of
sympathy, guilt or sheer familiarity,
have taken him to heart.

He does what he can to avoid the
debate over his presence, preferring
instead to continue singing, and
while it can be argued that he should
not be allowed to camp out along
Forbes Avenue with his blue folding
chair and Panasonic cassette / radio,

the question of whether he has got .

real singing talent has never been

Blll Dorsey
asked; ‘

But even Bill found it impossible
to compete with the sounds of Oak-
land; a chorus of Forbes Avenue car,
bus, truck and ambulance traffic
along with the scramble of passing
pedestrians. Except for the occa-
sional request which he handles a
capella, Bill now only plays tapes of
himself which he makes at home by
singing along to the radio.

Nevertheless, some shop .owners
and passers-by would rather he keep
his singing, be it live or Memorexed,
to himself, or as some have sug-
gested, use it where it can be better
appreciated. At least one critic
threatened to have him removed,
but Bill avoided the incident and
moved across the street. In the past
year, he has moved from the Giant
Eagle, to the corner of McKee Place,
to the side of the White Tower, to the

Wuelleh photo

from of Life Uniform, to the end of
the Pancake Kitchen and now, he
can be found in between Thrift Drug
and McDonalds.

One store manager, who asked
not to be identified, said, “l think
anyone who runs a business worries
about attracting customers. I
wouldn't want him in front of my
store only because people will either
rush by or even walk on the other
side of the street so as not to be
bothered."

But not all of the managers and
store owners agree, some in fact
count themselves among Bill's big-
gest fans.

“I don't see why someone with
that kind of talent isn't given the
proper supervision and training and
put on the road to economic inde-
pendence,” the manager at Life Uni-

Posvar, Execs Meet

Wednesday, June 8,_‘l 983

With President

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

A committee of university presi-
dents and corporate heads met with
President Reagan this week to dis-
cuss economic, industrial and inter-
national competitiveness.

The Washington visit followed a
l6-page report report by a task force
of the Business-Higher Education
Forum, of which Pitt chancellor
Wesley Posvar and Rockwell Inter-
national chief executive Robert
Anderson are members.

Reagan responded favorably to
recommendations made by the
committee.

“[Reagan] expressed a strong
interest and approval in what we
recommended," Posvar said.

Earlier that day, committee
members met with Reagan's per-
sonal staff and gave a briefing to
some government officials about the

report.

“Many of the report's suggestions
are directed to improving America's
position.in the international com-
petitive arena," said Anderson,
forum chairman.

Posvar is a past chairman of the
78 member forum, which was estab-
lished five years ago to foster coop-
eration between corporations and
institutions of higher education.

The United States is losing its
competitive edge in the world econ-
omy, according to the report.

“Today,” the report said, “foreign
countries have targeted and are win-
ning major world market shares in
the rapidly growing high technology
and service industries of the future."

“We have a very critical set of
problems," Posvar said. “We used to

dominate the export of high technol-
ogy, and we're even losing that."

The overall recommendation of .
the forum is: “As a nation, we must
develop a consensus that industrial
competitiveness is crucial to our
social and economic well being.”

The forum calls for “a shift in pub-
lic attitudes about national priorities
as well as changes in public percep-
tions about the nature of our eco-
nomic malaise.”

This change in attitude should
begin with the president, according
to the report. It calls for presidential
focus on concerns like “trade and
investment, regulatory reform, tech-
nological innovation and the devel-
opment of human resources.”

The forum expects Reagan to
make a public statement in the near
future, according to Posvar, and will
appoint a commission to address
some of the issues dealt with in the
report.

The forum also suggested ways in
which universities and business,
separately and collectively, can
work towards the competitive effort.

“Universities have to pay increas-
ing interest to international studies,
foreign area studies [and] foreign
language training," Posvar said.
“Universities can play a very‘large
role in excelling the areas of
research."

Posvar said he believes Pitt is
accomplishing some of these goals

with the Foundation for Applied

Sciences and Technology, by streng- '

thening the engineering school and
by Pitt's focus on international
studies.

"I think we're already involved in
the ways recommended,” he said.

New Mervis

' The construction of Pitt's new
Graduate School of Business
building—or the new Mervis
Hall—is on schedule, and offi-
cials say the building will be
ready to house students starting
this fall.

Raymond Damm, of the
dean's office, said that by Sept. 1,
the building will be able to hold
all the students enrolled in the
MBA program at Pitt. The
building, designed by IKN-SEG
of Pittsburgh, will cost approxi-
mately $7 million to complete.

Although many MBA pro-
grams across the country are suf-
fering from declining enroll-
ment, Pitt is not one of them,
said Walther McGhee, director
of admissions for the Graduate
School of Business. .

The number of application
his office has received are up over
last year's, McGhee said. The
economy is having a bad effect
on the number of MBA students
nationwide, he said, but the
attraction of the MBA as a
degree is still there.

Pitt's MBA program is run on

a 51 credit basis. For full-time

students, that amounts to $4,500.
for in-state residents and $9,000
for out-of-state residents. Part-
time students are charged per
credit. It's $133 for in-state resi-
dents and $266 for out-of-state
residents.

Pitt has 225 full-time students
and 755 students totally, and
McGhee said he dots not see that ’
number declining in the near
future.

“The economy is really hurting
many MBA programs in the
country," he said. “But it's not
hurting our admissions at all.”

The location of Mervis Hall
will be across from Forbes Quad-
rangle by Mazeroski‘s Wall.
That same area has the brick
Fine Arts Building, Carnegie
Library and Forbes Quad——all
different architecurally. Damm
said the architects wanted the
building to be different from any
others in the area. '

“They didn't want it to look
like another appendage to
Forbes Quad,“ he said. “They
wanted a unique-looking build-
ing, and when it's finished, it will
be just that.” ‘

 

 

features

Summertime is almost synony-
mous with the Three Rivers Arts
Festival for thousands of Pitts-
burghers every year. Even if you’re
not from Pittsburgh, the festival is a
way to beat summer boredom and
see the city at its best.

The annual Three Rivers Arts
Festival could be described as a dis-
play of performing and visual artists

V that takes place in the downtown

setting. This year, for the first time
ever, the festival will span for a

 length of 17 days (June 10 through

26) in Gateway Center downtown,
about 20 minutes from the Pitt cam-
pus. Traditionally, the festival is 10
days long.

“One can come this year in a
more relaxed setting and enjoy the
festival,” said John Brice, the direc-
tor of the festival in explaining the
extneded length.

The Three Rivers Arts Festival is
a tradition that began 24 years ago,
originally as a part of the Women's
Committee of the Carnegie Insti-
tute. It is still sponsored by that
committee.

The original intention was to pro-
vide an opportunity for visualartists
to exhibit their work in a setting
where the general public would feel
comfortable and could easily enjoy
the exhibits.

\ Over the course of 24 years, dif-
ferent things have been added to the
festival. For example, performing
arts, special projectsand more days
were added. ‘

“Each year we try to be a little bit
different,” Brice said.

This year the performing arts will
be on two stages—one located in
Point State'Park and the other on
the Westinghouse Plaza.

The addition of the Westinghouse
Plaza provide the opportunity for an
outdoor cafe. For the ﬁrst time there
will be an area where people’ can
come and enjoy foods in a relaxed
atmosphere as well as enjoy some of
the performing artists, who range
this year from Ella Fitzgerald to the
Corbin Hanner Band to the Pitts-
burgh Symphony.

This new setting has also pro-
videclan opportunity to deal with
some classical groups in a more
“conducive” atmosphere, accord-
ing to Brice.

The visual arts will be exhibited
on the plazas of Gateway Center in
addition to indoor exhibitions in the
lobby of Westinghouse Plaza, the
Steelworkers Building, Pennsylva-
nia Institute and the Courthouse.

Some special exhibits have also
been incorporated into the festival.
This year there will be three “spe-
cial” projects, which include» a col-
laborative piece by five artists to be
located in the moat area of Point
State Park.

There will also be what is called
the “refrigerator doors”-outdoors.
This is a project by two artists which
incorporates 15 refrigerator doors

welded together. It will operate both

as a piece of sculpture and as a
gallery for works done by children
participating in the young people's
areas. .

Pitt-Ar-tis ts
ShowTough
Edge

By Diane Lefkowitz

Any hobby that one wants to
pursue seriously requires a lot of
hard work and dedication. Being a
student and an artist can be espe-
cially tough.

James Ewart, a Pitt senior who
has two paintings entered in the
Three Rivers Arts Festival, finds
that he can work on his artwork and
his studies by “losing time eating
and sleeping.”

Ewart, 24, paints “large planes of
color that have references to physi-
cal parts, (like) bones, but not
necessarily things you can readily
recognize,” he said.

He has been painting for about six
years and calls his form of art “new
expressionism.” He said he was
very surprised that he was accepted
at the Three Rivers Arts Festival.

The third special project will be a
ﬂoating sculpture, which will be sus-
pended by 36 small balloons. The
exhibit will be 25 feet wide by 25 feet
long by 35 feet high and will be float-
ing in the Point.

“The festival is interesting in that
one can come and see these special
projects and enjoy the many visual
art exhibitions in an outdoor set-
ting,” Brice said. “There is such a
wide range of both the performing
and the visual artists.

“We try to showcase not only they
establishedartist by also try to allow ’
the young emerging artist the
opportunity of having that audience.

The food at the festival has come ,
a long way since the hot dogs and ice
cream sandwiches originally sup-
plied by vendors from downtown
restaurants. This year there will be
14 food booths, featuring different
foods like quiche, shishkabob and
funnel cake.

“The idea is to sell something a
little bit different,” said Nancy Brem,
director of public relations for the
festival.

The first food booth appeared at
the festival about six years ago. It
was sponsored by Hadassah, a W
national organization of Jewish
women, and sold crepes and
blintzes.

“The festival realized it was a
great source of income,” Brem said.
“More importantly, we thought, if
you're going to have an arts festival,
the food might as well be nice, too.”

Some other attractions .of this
year’s festival include a children's
area, which can be found this year at
the Big Blue Tent in Point State
Park. It will feature activities such as
story telling, funshops where child-
ren can learn puppet-making, musi-
cal instrument construction and
many other crafts.

There will also be two performan-,«

ces a day specifically designed for
children.

Another daily attraction in two
areas of Gateway Four Plazas is
called the Artists-in-Action. Here
the public can watch ongoing dem-
onstrations of crafts by various
artists. These crafts range from
wheel-thrown pottery to jewelry
making.

Over $300,000 will be expended in
this year’s festival, according to
Brem, and they find themselves in
the red almost every year.

“We pay for ourselves,” she said.
“We get. most of our support from
contributions by corporations and
individuals. The idea is to break
even.”

The city also helps out financially
and provides certain services to the
festival free of charge. This is the
first year festival officials hope to
make a profit from the food booths.

As the festival is nearing its 25th
anniversary in 1984, preparations
are already being made. Some of the
projects already in progress include
an exhibit in contemporary glass
and an exhibit in forged steel. Also
recognition will be given to some of
the more outstanding artists of the
past 24 years.

Prestige And
Prizes

By Wes Cotter

The Three Rivers Arts Festival
offers local artists a chance to dis-
play their work and pain recogni-
tion, but it also offers attractive
awards to it’s most talented
members.

Art is both sold and displayed at
the festival, and awards are given to
the artists judged worthy.

Judging for the Arts Festival is
performed by prestigious experts
from all over the country, according
to Donna Chase, visual coordinator
for the festival.

“Jurors are picked by recommen-
dation from past contacts and other
festivals, but each year we always
have an out of town juror,” Chas
said. 0

“I’ve always gone to see Three
Rivers and never thought that my
work was good enough to enter,” he
said, “but this year I thought,“What
the hell; let’s do it!’ ” _

Even though this is his first time in
Three Rivers Arts Festival, Ewart IS
not a newcomer to art exhibitions.
He had'an exhibition of his own art-
work at the Laboratory Theater on
North Craig Street in Oakland. _

“The thrill for the artist is domg
the work and getting it accepted and
seeing it on display,” he said.

He said he believes the Three Riv-
ers Arts Festival will be a lot differ-
ent from past festivals because the
art will now lean more toward the
new trend of expressionism.

“A lot of people are going to be
very surprised,” he said. “A new
wave of painters have been
accepted to Three Rivers, and some,
people who had more conservative
work got rejected.”

Ewart puts about 12 hours a day
into his artwork, which costs him
eating and sleeping time during the
school year. .

“My friends say I start to look at
little bit gray,” he said. .

After graduating from Pitt. he

plans to study painting in Colorado.

With a husband, three children, a
job and classes, Lynn Stump has her
hands full. Still, this 38-year-old Pitt
student will find time to visit the
Three Rivers Arts Festival to see her
artwork on display this year.

Stump has one piece of scratch-
board art entered in the festival.
Scratchboard, she said, is done
using a pen-like instrument to
scratch on a board coated with
black ink.

“I work from black to white
instead of white to black,” she said.

This is the first art show Stump
has entered since high school.

“I just thought it would be fun to
do,” she said. “I was surprised I was
even accepted.”

Art is just a hobby to Stump at

this point. Between her work as a

wife, mother, part-time psychology
student and registered nurse at
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, she puts about 20,hours a
week into her hobby.

She finds that people react with
excitment when she tells them she is
entered in the festival.

“I didn’t think I would get that
reaction, but I did,” she said.

The _
Competition

continued from page two

This year's most notable judges
are: John Hanhart of the Whitney
Museum in New York; Jill Freid-
man, a freelance photographer also _,
from New York; and Howard Fox
curator of the painting and sculp-
ture garden at the Hirschorn
Gallery (part of the Smithsonian
Institution) in Washington, D.C.

Although the
Three Rivers Art
Festival is a good
time for most of
us, itcan be very
competitive for
some artists.

Areas of judging are diverse; art at

the festival is broken into six catego- ~.

ries: painting, graphics, indoor
sculpture and crafts (ceramics and
fibers), photography, ﬁlm and
videography. .

Each of these six categories is jur-
ied, according to Chase, and given
cash awards. The festival award for
each category is $450. The Juror’s
Discretionary is also given in each
category and carries $250 as its cash
prize. Honorable Mentions are also
awarded, but they carry no cash
award.

A new award will also be given this
year, the Popular Award.

“As a first, festival visitors will

coupon can be found in the festival
catalogue and should be dropped at
any information or sales booth,”
Chase said.

Chase said this gives people the
chance to show what they like. A
$250 award will be given after the
show.

Not all the art in the exhibition is
classified the same way. Chase
explained that there is the juried art
group and the artists’ market.

The market gives six awards that

will be presented at three different".

times during the festival. The art

was judged in March at the time the .

slides were presented, and the
prizes will be given on June 9.

The artists’ market also features a
number of outstandingartists dem-
onstrating their craft at the festival.
Chase said that a new feature of the
festival is that 15 artists will automat-
ically be asked to return next vear.

Chase said the work is judged on:
creativity, craftmanship, diversity of
work and booth display. The
winners in the artists’ market
receive a plaque for their booth, as
well as a $125 cash award.

« The artists's market is a part of
the show where people can look at
different pieces and actually buy
them if they like.

Chase explained that artists are
asked to submit five slides of their

work as an example of what they .

have to offer. /

“If you're a potter, you send five
slides of your pots so the jury can
get a very good ideal of quality. Then
the artists are selected and each
works on a cash-and-carry basis
from his booth.” '

This year, the art market had 248
entrants but only 104 were invited to
participate in the festival, Chase
said. '-

“We try as much as we can to help
artists.” she said.

“Every piece of art in the juried
exhibition is judged,” she said.
When juried art is viewed by the
judges, they are presented up to
three pieces at a time. This is done
so that an overall feel for the artist's
work can be obtained, she said.

Performances draw large Festival crowds.

Coaxed by friends and her own

went to~help in the childrenfs day-
care program at the Jewish Coni-

the Child Development Program in
the School of Health Related Pro-
fessions (HRP), a‘ school distin-
guished by a 61 percent honor
graduate ratio in its April graduat-
ing class.

“It takes a special kind of person
to work with children,” Milnes said.
Several factors contribute to the
high number of honor graduates in
HRP, according to Sandy
Schmerin, the school’s director of

student affairs and services.

Schmerin said since HRP is an
upper-level school—enrollment
begins in the junior year—students I
are motivated to work hard and
have a clear idea of their objectives
and goals.

Secondly, the school’s thorough
and competitive admission guide-
lines screen out all but the most
qualified students. Each student is
required to submit a written self-
evaluation outlining interests, expe-
riences and professional goals in
their selected program, in addition
to three evaluation forms by individ-
uals other than family members.

There are seven programs in
HRP: occupational therapy, HRP
interdisciplinary, program, clinical

d~ietetics/ nutrition, child develop-
ment and child care, physical ther-
apy and medical technology. All,
except for medical technology, also
require extensive volunteer work as
a prerequisite for admission.

The most formidable competition
is in physical therapy. which admits
only 60 out of 400 applicants.

Finally, a minimal Quality Point
Average (QPA) of 2.5 figures deci-
sively in admission—physical ther-
apy has an average QPA of
3.45—although Schmerin said most
applicants’ QPAs easily exceed the
minimum.

Milnes, who has an overall QPA
of 3.8 and a 4.0 in child develop-
ment, said a strong academic back-
ground is vital because of HRP’s

“The only problem we had was
that he has such a powerful voice,
that we couldn’t hear our custo-

said.\“I think he has a beautiful
voice, but anything that you have to

Bill thinks that some businesses
have taken advantage of the public-

the television crews and reporters
have left, his eviction soon follows.

Not all his moves, however, have
been prompted by angry shop
owners. He left his spot alongside
the White Tower after’ a group of

_ kids thought it cute to throw a fire-

cracker at the blind man. The fire-
cracker exploded right in Bill’s lap
about the time his nephew was tug-

1 “I went right to the telephone to
call for someone to pick up my
nephew,“ he said. “I bumped into a
baby stroller, ant the little girl's
mother started shouting and
screaming, ‘Watch it.’ I said, ‘How
can I watch it when I can't see?’ "

Since then, Bill has been singing
elsewhere, and although the people
at the White Tower don’t miss him,
they say he was welcome to stay.

Zeigler said. “I think he just milks an
area then moves on.”

An average day on the street
brings in about $10 to $20 dollars a
day Bill says. Not much, but enough
to stretch a monthly Social Security
check into a good living.

“People say, ‘You’re a blind beg-
gar,’ ”.he said. “My mother said,
‘You ain’t going to be nothing but a
blind beggar.’ Well, I have news for

' people; not only are there blind beg-
gars, but there are people out there
without homes who are begging as
well.”

Like a lot of people, some of his
relatives don't like to see him on the
streets—singing or, as they see it,
begging. But Bill insists that “beg-
ging and singing are two different
things."

“My relatives disowned me
because they don’t like to see me out
here. But if they would have had
patience with me when I was young,
then I wouldn’t ‘have to be this
way.’ ”

“People react to handicapped

the beginning, there is segregation in

the schools,” Bill said. “They insist

on putting the healthy in one and the
handicapped in‘ another.”

way: as long as you’re surviving,
then you’re doing good.”

Opinion  

Tuition
Fight
Setback

The day may come when students will have to
physically disrupt the operation of the university
in order to protect their rights. Someday, when
administrators refuse to hear student voices,
there may be no other recourse. That day has not
yet arrived at Pitt.

The Progressive Student Network (PSN)
recently jumped the gun by disrupting a univer-
sity Board of Trustees meeting to dramatize its
opposition to a proposed tuition increase. In
response, Student Activities director W. Andrew
Smith suspended the group’s funding and pro-
gramming privileges, and Pitt students are left
farther than ever from mounting a successful
challenge to the tuition hike proposal.

Actions such as those of the PSN are a tried-
and-true method of polarizing public opinion
because they leave no room for compromise or
moderate views. Many students who might have
joined the PSN in challenging a tuition increase
will be unable to endorse disruption ofa Board of
Trustees meeting; in other words, PSN has driven
many potential allies into the opposition’s camp
and has lost its student government funding in the
bargain.

There is still time for students opposed to a

-tuition hike to work “through channels,” asking ’

to have the tuition proposal placed on the Trus-
tees’ agenda——rather than losing tempers when it
is not. If the adminstration refuses to subject this
proposal to tough public scrutiny, then the
administration—and not students—will be in the
positionof driving away potential supporters. s
In fact, theadministration had started to move

in that direction by resisting PSN attempts to put
’ the tuition hike‘on the agenda of the ill-fated May

l9 meeting. There is, after all, nojustification for L

refusing any student’s request (in advance of a
meeting) to discuss an important issue.

The Progressive Student Network, then, has
drawn attention away from any possible wrong-
doing in the university’s handling of the tuition
hike proposal. It has snatched defeat from the
jaws of victory. ‘

Reagan’s Right-Wing Men

BY LAURA SCHAFRON

Secretary of State George Schultz
recently filled two State Department
posts involved in shaping our policy
toward El Salvador. Langhorne
Anthony Motley has been named

“Enders and
Hinton had
become thorns
in thesides of
conservatives
pushing for
increased aid
to the area.”

.Assistant Secretary of State for

Inter-American Affairs, replacing
Thomas Enders, and Thomas Pick-
ering has been appointed U.S.
Ambassador to El Salvador, replac-
ing Deane Hinton.

According to Schultz, these were
routine transfers; however, it is no
small coincidence that Enders and
Hinton had, of late, become thorns
in the sides ofeconservatives pushing
for increased aid to the area.
Although both men support military

aid to El Salvador, Enders had also
called for economic aid and political

- reform. Hinton recently embarassed

some official by chastising the Sal-
vadoran government for civil rights
abuses.

Apparently both men had cooled
somewhat toward Reagan adminis-
tration policy for the region—a shift
strongly disapproved of by other top
foreign policy officials, including
National Security Advisor William
Clark and U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick‘.

The men chosen to replace Enders
and Hinton are staunch Republi-
cans. Motley, as ambassador to
Brazil, had little experience in deal-
ing with the state department
bureaucracy, and Pickering most
recently served as ambassador to
Nigeria. The administration has
found themselves a.couple of “safe”
men——loyalists, some would say yes-
men, with little experience where
they need it most who are unlikely or
unable to rock the boat.

In choosing these men, Schultz
and the rest of the administration
have successfully avoided allowing
power to fall into the hands of
anyone disagreeing with a strong
military-based approach to Central
American policy, thereby guaran-
teeing that any actions they take will
be received with little or no opposi-

tion. They have wasted no time in '

Further, in taking these actions
without specific authorization from
Congress, the Reagan administra-
tion has shown a striking disregard
for both the balance of power which
is suppoosed to be inherent in
government and for public opinion.
And Speakes admits that public
opinion runs strongly counter to
military involvement in El Salvador.
In losing Enders and Hinton, a large
segment of the Americanpublic has
lost a representative voice for mod-
eration in favor of expediency.

JIMMY STEWART

  

Actor Jimmy Stewart's favorite
among his 80—odd films is It's A Won-
derful Life, a sentimental piece directed
by Frank Capra. The title was used
repeatedly as metaphor for Stewart's
weekend home in Indiana, Pa., May
20-22.

More than a year ago, Indiana
asked Jimmy Stewart if he would visit
his hometown to celebrate his 75th
birthday. As a gift to its favorite son,
Indiana would dedicate a nine-foot
high bronze statue of the actor on the
courthouse lawn as a reminder that
this is Stewart's hometown. When
Stewart agreed to come, the Jimmy
Stewart Statue Committee Inc.,
chaired by, county auditor Linda
Moore, set to work.

Indiana is a small town (population
16,000); the fact that James Stewart,
movie actor, was born here is ‘the
city's proud claim to fame. As one
gentleman aptly put it, ”I’m from
Indiana, Pa., birthplace of Jimmy Ste-

wart. And no one has to ask who he
15.

He is the nominal favorite actor in
the area, even for those who've never
seen a Stewart film, and a stone with
a brass plate marks his birthplace
(now the grounds of a funeral home).

Just as his hometown refers to
itself out of necessity as "Indiana-
Peeaye" in order to keep an identity,
as fierce and proud is their claim on
Jimmy Stewart. Word of the impend-
ing birthday celebration spread.
"This is the biggest thing to hit Indi-
ana ever," according to the Chamber
of Commerce.

Friday, May 20

A look at the well-circulated
calendar of events reveals that no
minutes will be wasted between the
official greeting this afternoon at the
courthouse and the official
goodbye—-a private plane flight out

Story  Photos'By Richard Sateir

of the Jimmy Stewart Airfield on
Sunday.

The sun can't decide whether or
not to stay out, and Indiana does its
best to be nonchalant, but perhaps
the citizenry is more suit-and-tie
dressed than usual for a Friday.
Things are quiet, yet anticipation is
palpable.

Philadelphia Street, the main drag,
is dressed in flags as if for a patriotic
event; store windows wear "Happy
Birthday Jimmy” bumper stickers, old
movie stills, and reproductions of a
grey, black and white artist's rendi-
tion of Stewart.

The main event starts at one
o'clock at the front of the courthouse.
Dr. Ronald Thomas, vice president of
the celebration committee, will act as
official emcee, and he has been hold-
ing things in suspension for over‘ an
hour, clearly enjoying himself. Jimmy
Stewart's World War II buddies,
friends of the family and acquaintan-

ces are invited to dredge up memories
and visit the microphone with them.

”Where are ‘you from?" he asks,
and those from as far away as Florida
and Utah and California shout out

their homestates. Stewart stories are I

swapped among the closely-packed
crowd; they refer to him in the famil-
iar "Jimmy" as if they would not be
surprised to see him on any day at the
drug store.

They're primed, applauding ever-
yone introduced and nodding enthu-
siastically in agreement as Stewart's
old Sunday school teacher, Martha
Iseman, says ”he was just as cute then
as he is now." Cameras click, and
Thomas agrees.

”So many lives he's touched in so
many ways," he says.

But one o'clock does arrive, the
appointed hour (things will stay
remarkably on schedule all weekend),

and there he is, coming down the

sort of made up my mind about cer-
tain things, about hard work being
worth it, about community spirit,
about the importance of the family,
about the importance of God," he
says.

"I've been a tremendously fortu-
nate fellow, and I'm forever grateful

tury...will be hallowed when present andfuture

the movies.

He still seems to be the shy boy
everyone thought he was. His plea-
sure and surprise at the turn-out is
-genuine. At any rate, he's patient and
seems not bothered by the powerful
sentiment of the remarks which fol-
low, directed at him and illustrated at
length. He remains pleased and
unembarrassed.

Malcolm Alexander, designer and
sculptor of the statue, to be dedicated
tomorrow, explains that he's tried to
catch "the essence of the man...who
lives next door to everyone...t-he man
as we will remember him...the man in
our mind.”

Linda Moore, the prime motivator
of the celebration, has her turn at the
microphone. "We salute you, we
appreciate you, we love you,"she tells
Stewart, certainly voicing the over-
riding opinion of the crowd at this
moment.

Stewart's patented drawl is the
same, and he is delightful. "Well. Ron
says that we're on schedule...well
....ah...well, I'll fix that. It looks like an
extra special birthday...I've had my
share of them. This is something I
will cherish." He says the right
things, and when he's done, the
crowd surrounds him inside the
courthouse. He is still polite and
gently firm, offering handshakes and
a few autographs and gracefully
turning down the rest. And always
patient.

Following the welcome, Jimmy

‘Stewart explains himself at a well-

attended press conference, discuss-
ing the hometown influence.

"I was completely surprised," Ste-
wart comments on the morning's
welcome; ”the whole thing has been
very exciting to me...it's something
I'll ‘really never forget."

"The things that I learned growing
up in lndiana...things that I've keep
with me all my life. This is where I

for the chance I've had to continue as
long as I have in my chosen profes-
sion. So much of it has depended on
good luck.” I

It could've been any small town;
thank Alexander and Bess Jackson
Stewart that their son, James Mait-
land Stewart, was born in Indiana PA
on May 20, 1908.

But Mr. Stewart is glad to acknow-

. ledge his debt to his hometown. His

father ran the local hardware store;
two younger sisters completed the
family, and their (second) home can
be seen over on Seventh Street. At
15, James Stewart left Indiana for
school, later attending Princeton. But
his degree in architecture offered lit-
tle security when he chose the
theater instead. 4 I

He joined the University Players, a
repertory company where his co-
workers included Henry Fonda and
Margaret Sullivan,‘ who would later
appear in films with Stewart. The
Hollywood career started in 1935
with Murder Man, and except for his
stint in the air force during World
War II, has continued uninterrupted.

Privately, Stewart and his wife
Gloria are exceptions to the Holly-
wood rule. They will have been Mr.
and Mrs. for 34 years this August.
She is gracious and content to remain
in the background; it is clearly her
husband's weekend, but she provides
company and moral support.

Still active in the movie business,
Stewart recently completed work on
Right Of Way, which teams him for the
first time with Bette Davis, another
veteran. The film is scheduled for
pay-television release in the Fall.
Asked how he feels about the indus-
try, Stewart names two problems
with movies today: ”The film
medium has the capability of variety
that's been neglected in the last ten-
fifteen years. I don't think in today's
film market there's enough variety,"

he says. "I believe everybody talks too
much in pictures today...the motion
picture is a visual medium."

Might he ever return to this home-
town to live? "I wouldn't be sur-
prised," he says. ‘

The press conference lasts a strict
45 minutes, and no other interviews
will be granted. Next, Stewart heads
out to the new water works for a
ribbon cutting and a glass of water.
"It's good," he says.

Another ribbon cutting opens the
Stewart film festival at the Indiana
Mall Cinema, beginning that night
with The Spirit Of St. Louis (1957), the
story of Charles Lindbergh's famous
flight. Jay Rubin, long-time fan and
enthusiast, coordinated the event, 13
films spread over the three days. At
least the opening film sells out: Ste-

ductory remarks.

"I’m so overwhelmed by this won-
derful day here. It's the ._ happiest
birthday I've ever had, and I've had
quite a few. Ifeel as though I've never
been away," he says,

”Criticism and opinion have meant
a lot to me all through my career," he
says. Of Spirit of St. Louis: "It's about a
great man. I hope you enjoy it."

Tonight's big event—~the real
birthday party—is a $50 a plate ~
dinner dance at the local Omni Con-
vention Center. The 550 tickets sold
out weeks ‘ ago. Governor Dick
Thornburgh toasts the guest of
honor, and after dinner, Mrs. Stew-
art helps her husband extinguish the:
75 candles on the birthday cake.

A film tribute combines random
pieces of Stewart's life and career and
concludes with the Mormon Taber-
nacle Choir's rendition of "Happy
Birthday." Visibly moved, ‘Stewart in

can't we say 'Happiest birthday, lndi-

Stewarts lead the dancing, and he
directs the orchestra's "Moonlight
Serenade" as he did in The Glenn Miller
Story in 1954.

Saturday, May 21

Last evening's affair was kept com-
fortably intimate because of the
limited number of tickets sold. Both
the parade and the statue unveiling
takes place today. The schedule says
there will be harness horse-racing at
the local fairgrounds, a Boy Scout
jamboree of some sort, an antique car
show, a musical tribute to Stewart, a
re—enactment of the French and
Indian War, and a square dance
tonight—if anyone is still standing. 

At ten o'clock the parade will start7—A~‘§‘-
winding down Philadelphia Street,
and by eight, the most fervant are
seated in folding chairs along the
route. Again, the sky can't decide
whether to clear or not; the indeci-
sion will remain all day.

Stewart and his Mrs. lead the
parade, smiling and waving from the
back seat of a chauffered converti-
ble. Their audience is several yards
thick in spots, eager, and prepared for
the moment with cameras. "Happy
birthday, Jimmy!" is yelled from both

sides of the street, and signs and \

banners proclaiming the same are in
evidence.

The parade, an eager coalition ofﬂr

about 35 area school bands and var-
ious floats bearing well-wishers,
marches down Philadelphia Street. A
series of antique cars is scattered
through the ranks, each advertising a
Stewart movie of the same vintage as
the car. (For example, a 1936 model
for Rose Marie, a 1936 film).

The Stewarts and the Celebration
Committee view the remains of the
parade from a high platform a block
behind the main street. As usual,
security is tight, with police posit-gt)
ioned grimly around the stand
attempting to control the persuasive
masses. Everyone wants an auto-
graph or a handshake, and the police-
men push them away, but the most
persistent reach and connect. Stew-

art even signs a copy of the 1941 Life
magazine with his picture on the
cover. Few around the platform are
watching the parade, an efficient
affair, entirely completed within little

._ more than an hour.

,..

The scene in front of the court-
house is hysteria waiting to happen.
As soon as the parade had gone by,
the crowd began gathering at the
ropes for the statue dedication, and
by noon, thesurrounding area is the
cliched "veritable sea." Nearly all of
Indiana Pa.’s 16,000 appear to be out,
plus eight or nine thousand from sur-
rounding areas, and everyone guards
his space carefully, straining to see
and hear, and annoyed with anyone

attempting to move closer. Some

have been waiting upwards of two
hours for a glimpse of the statue-
tantalizingly covered—and its
inspiration.

Antagonism toward the press is
strong: the privilege of the white
press pass and camera seems unfair
to everyone. Indianians want Stew-
art for themselves; if they had a say in
things, there would be no "foreign-
ers" here and no press beyond the
local gazette.

But it. is twelve o'clock now, and
again Mr. Stewart emerges from the
courthouse to another—and perhaps
_the most———overwhelming reception.
More anecdotes and presentation fol-
low in the tradition of beating a dead
horse. But the statue offers the most
tangible evidence of Indiana's loyalty
to their favorite son. The event was
"One and a half years in the making,”
says Ron Thompson. "For the people
of Indiana, Pa.——the way Jimmy
would want us to do it."

President Reagan, an old Holly-
wood friend, telephones, wishing

‘Stewart a "happy 36th anniversary of

your 39th birthday.” Two Air Force

‘jets zoom low and deafeningly over

the courthouse in a tribute to Ste-

ier General. The jets drown out the a

several months, of Jimmy Stewart as
he appeared in Winchester 73, a 1950
film.

"What will people think?” asks
John Varner, chairman of the dedica-
tion committee."Why did they do it?
Why? To honor an outstanding citi-
zen of Indiana, Pennsylvania, to
honor an American model of patriot-
ism, to pay respect to the Puritan
ethic of achievement, to emphasize

the family unit tradition that distin-

guishes the American life...to honor
the talent, the achievement, the his-
tory, the family and the person of
Jimmy Stewart.”

”This emblem of the Small Town in
the Big City...this emblem of human-
ity of the twentienth century...will be
hallowed when present and future
generations reflect that, here-
represented in bronze—is the replica
of God's greatest creation: man."

”I can’t tell you how much...the
effort that has been put forth here in
Indiana means to me," Stewart says.
"This is certainly turning out"to be an
extraordinary birthday.”

"To all of you that made this a very
special time in my life: I'm very grate-

Th thmarker...

ful for the honor that you've bes-
towed upon me. You have made me
feel that I still belong here, and I'm
very proud of that.”

"Growing up here was a very

important and very happy time in my V

life...it’s the character of Indiana. We
keep it with us wherever we go. I've
always known I could come back here
any day and settle right back with no
questions asked. I...I belong here,”
Stewart says. "I'm proud that so
many of you call me friend, and in
return, I want you to know I call you
friend and I think of you as family."

Who is this man, this actor, this
Jimmy Stewart?

The problem of separating fact
from fiction apparently does not
exist: in Stewart's case, the man actu-
ally is the myth. All the stories about
Jimmy Stewart being a nice, retiring
fellow and a hometown boy on loan
to the world must be true, mustn't
they? There are no indications given
that the opposite is true, and blaming
good public relations is too easy.

He retains his graciousness despite
the innumerable presentations and
honors and awards, and he remains
polite throughout the-heartfelt;
perhaps but nonetheless
embarrasing——verbal tributes setting

the family, God, and. the American
Way of Life. It is certainly a heavy
load to heap entirely upon one man.

At three o'clock, Stewart arrives at
the grounds, making an appearance
at ‘the various events scheduled more
or less in his honor. I-Ie stops briefly
at the horse racing and at the
encampment of Mercer's Third Bat-
tallion (a sort of living history organi-
zation; they exhibit French and

Indian War battle tactics).

Area Boy.Scouts are in the middle
of an event called a "carnporee," with
the troops demonstrating outdoor
survival skills. It coincided with the
Stewart birthday celebration, and
'Stewart—a former Scout—agreed to
make an appearance. I‘-Ie addresses
the gathering, explaining why he
missed becoming a first-class Eagle
Scout. "Lifesaving...someone always
had to rescue me," he, says and
accepted a souvenir "Jimmy Stewart
and Scouting” program book and hat
with a Jimmy Stewart picture badge.

The crowd—-noticeably smaller-
naturally follows him, and the-
urgency of good intentions causes
them to disregard the Scout leaders,
who are very much agitated. "Get
back! This is only for the Scouts!”
they announce with increasing
volume and decreasing courtesy.

"You Scouts areone of the basics of
this country," Stewart says, congrat-

ulating them for their dedication.

fairground pavillion. The Indi—annas,
a local women's group, offer "Back
Home in Indiana," discretely altered
to eliminate references to the other
_ Indiana's Wabash River. If "Happy
Birthday” is the first theme song of
the weekend, then "Back Home" is
next in line. ‘Stewartjoins them for a
chorus of "Ragtime Cowboy Joe," in
and out of tune but certainly the
highlight of the program and quite a
bit of fun. Various groups do their
bit, providing entertainment based
loosely on Jimmy Stewart. The local‘
accordian club plays two polkas

the instrument since his younger
days.
He-has earned a rest.

Sunday, May 22

The rain shows itself this morning,
but Air Affair '83, an air show at the
Jimmy Stewart Airfield,“still plans to
take to the skies at one o'clock as
scheduled. It's Indiana, Pa's farewell-
for-now salute, and a successful (if
soggy) one at that. The weather can
be blamed for the smaller turn-out at
this event, butmuddy water—ankle
deep in ‘places—does not deter the
vigorous.

Stewart had intended to leave ear-

» lier but decided to stay for the show
"to pay my respects to all of you," he‘

The musical tribute unrolls in the

‘A I y W ‘Pug’-

says, "in spite of the —-what shall we
call it?"——he examines the ominous
sky-—"Sprinkles?" More presenta-

tion and honorary tokens,’ and with

his usual grace and, by now, custom-I . A

ary familiarity with the procedure,
Stewart accepts each with polite
thanks. _

Stewart and his wife watch the
show from an observation platform
and umbrellas flap up and down as
the rain comes and goes. The public

address system discusses in detail the"

gyrations of various stunt planes and
bi—planes. Hopeful fans realize that
this is the last chance, and they wait
impatiently for a chance at his signa-
ture or a handshake. a

At 2:50 p.m., the Stewarts arise to
leave; they're golf-carted to the small
private plane. James Stewart waves
goodbye; the plane takes off.‘As if
signalled, rain dumps with tornado
force as soon as they are airborne.

It has been quite a weekend; Ste-,
wart has quite a bit to take home with
him, one way and another.

"Why?" is an easy question to ask-

about the statue and the whole event.
What thought ran through the com-
mittee minds as the plans were for-
mulated? An anti-faction . has
undoubtedly co-exsisted with the
celebration committee since its incep-
tion. ,

Indianians are naturallyreluctant
to admit it or discuss it. But what
about the anti-ranks? One young
girl, who'd marched in the parade and
sung in the statue dedication choir,
offered a . thoughtful conjecture:
"When they saw how nice he was, he
won them over." '

Yes. Jiminy Stewart's presence was
the nicest thing about the weekend;
his lined face—reassuringly comfor-
table and honest-—the most vivid and
the most satisfactory memory.

It's a Wondeful Life is a curious film.
George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), born
and raised in Bedford Falls, wants to
get out of "this crummy little
town...to see the world." But invaria-
bly unselfish and willing to sacrifice

for his family and neighbors, George .

never leaves Bedford Falls.

But one Christmas Eve finds
George Bailey in debt and at the end
of the rope, planning suicide for the
insurance money. Only the interven-
tion of God stops him, and Bailey is
allowed the privilege of seeing how

' things would have been in his home-

town had he never been born.
Stewart turned in a faultless per-
formance, but the film raises an
interesting question—is it such a
wonderful life? Back home in Indi-
ana, they've been telling Jimmy Ste-

wart that his certainly has been. At,

least for the weekend Mr. Stewart is
likely to agree.

“'* Sophomore hurdler Roger King-

dom became the first Panther since
Arnie Sowell in I954 to capture an
NCAA title, as he cruised to victory
completing the llO-meter strip of
barriers in a superior time of l3.54.

After fighting complications aris- '

ing from a collision during his trial
run, Kingdom entered the ﬁnal heat
with the third fastest time behind
Willie Gault of Tennessee and Rod-
ney Wilson of Villanova.

Then in the ﬁnal heat, everything
fell into place. i

“It was the first time all year that I

didn’t have to fight back to win,”

Kingdom said. “The most important
thing was that I got out of the blocks
first. I beat everybody to the first
hurdle. After that, I was able to
relax. Everyone had to chase me,
and they couldn’t catch me. It’s a
super feeling. I finally showed that I
could run my own race.

“Winning the NCAA title is a
once in a lifetime dream come true.
There are so many guys that come
up each year. The competition gets
tougher each year. Rodney Wilson
won one title, and it was when he
was a freshman. It‘sjust a great thrill
having done it.”

The lone Kingdom supporter
attending the meet in Houston was
his assistant coach Steve Lewis.

Looking Up

/‘-

Saurer Replenishes Roster
With Towering Recruits

' By SCOTT DELLETT

Like.men’s basketball years ago,
women’s basketball is experiencing
a height explosion. Now, a good col-
legiate team must have a plethora of
six footers in order to be among the
elite. An example was the women's
national champions, Southern Cali-
fornia, which had a front line of 6-3,
6-3 and 6-2. Another is Old Domin-
ion, which had 6-8 Anne Donavan at
center.

Lady Panther coach Judy Saurer
did not find anyone of Donavan‘s
size, but her aim was to replace for-
wards
Miklasevich. 1

“Our major concern was
obvious," she said. “We needed help
size-wise."

Saurer seemed to fill that need:
four of the six Lady Panther recruits
are over six foot, including 6-5
transfer Jenny Tyner, who will be
eligible to play in January.

One who may step in is 6-l Julie
Callan ofWillowbrook High School
in Lombard, Ill. Callan, a USA

Today honorable mention All-’

America, averaged 2'l points per
game while earning All-State honors
at forward.

“Julie is a player," Saurer said.
“She can play at (Miklasevich's)
spot, though I think no one can
replace her."

One position Saurer would prefer
to ﬁll is center. Last season, the Lady
Panthers played essentially with
three forwards. Besides Tyner and

c

Lynn Love and Pam

sophomore Pam George, recruit
Patty Paul should be in the running.
Paul comes from Canada with
outstanding statistics. She averaged
25 points per game and 28 rebounds
percontest at West Hill High School
in Ontario.
‘One of Saurcr‘s goals for recruits

I is excellence in the classroom as well

as on the court. Pam Novosel ﬁts
such a description. Novosel was
Valedictorian of West Forest High
School ..in Tionesta, Pa., and she
compiled a career average of 20.1

points a game and I8 boards a con- I

test. In her senior year, Novosel
scored over 23 points a game and
grabbed 17 rebounds.

Other local players who joined the
Lady Panthers is Jane Plake of
Serra Catholic. Plake can play either
point or shooting guard, and was
named All-State.

Transfer Lisa Fubio can also play
both guard positions. In her fresh-
man year at Connecticut, Fubio
averaged 9.4 points per game, while

finishing second in assists. The’

Altoona High School graduate, who
has three years of eligibility remain-
ing, played at the National Sports
Festival last summer.

With the number of big people
recruited, Jennifer Bruce might be
expected to»play a guard spot. That
IS not neccessarily so, according to
Saurer, because of the number of
quality guard returning.

“Jennifer won't play guard,“ she
said. “Our ‘strength is at guard,

where we have six or seven
returning.

“Jennifer plays well with her back
to the basket. She’s one of the best
post players around.”

But Saurer doesn't rule out Bru-
ce’s seeing some work outside.

One of Saurer‘s ‘goal when she
took the position two years ago was
to bring the program to national
prominence. The Lady Panthers
must be able to go head-to-head.
against the top teams and win in
order to receive attention. -

“We have a difficult schedule,"
Saurer said. “Clemson, South
Carolina, Penn State and Tennessee

‘are not easy wins. We have to win on

the road and beat nationally-ranked
teams." » '

The move to the Big East last sea-
son should have beneﬁted Pitt, but a
loss to Georgetown in the first round
of the Big East Tournament ruined
the Lady Panthers‘ chances of gain-
ing attention earlier.

“We have to win the Big. East,

Tournament in order to make it tow.

the NCAA tournament,” "Saurer
said. \ ‘I

But that may not be easy.,Even
though Pitt had a successful recruit-
ing year———at'least on paper—-the Big
East rivals have also experienced
good recruiting years. I

“Villanova is supposed to have the I

best recruiting year in the Big East,”
Saurer said, “but we have to see.”
But success is not measured in the
recruiting wars in April. Instead, it's
seen in the arenas in March. I

the field through the next five hur-
dles. After that, he just cruised
through the rest and won easily. He
was way out in front. Thre was no

‘ question about who won the race.”

Through Lewis’ eyes, Kingdom
did much more than cross the hur-
dles on the track. He leaped over a
few others along the way.

“Roger busted many barriers by
his performance on Saturday,” he
said. “The most important was that
he proved to himself that he could
compete with the best of the best and
win. He broke the Pitt barrier that
has existed at the outdoor meet for
the past six or seven years (the
Panthers achieving little to no suc-
cess at the NCAA outdoor meet). He
also made sure that he is a member
of the elite class of the most glamor-
ous sprint event in the world.”

His time will get him ranked in the
world. The 13.54 mark betters the

1968 Olympic gold medal perfor- ‘

mance by Willie Davenport. It is
probably one of the top 10 times in
the history of the event. ‘

The most astonishing aspect of
the whole Kingdom story is that the
success was achieved in such a short
time.

-Not until after the football spring

‘drills—in which Kingdom

participated——were completed a lit-
tle over a month ago was he able to
train solely for track purposes. On

the contrary, almost every guy with
whom he competed had been train-
ing throughout the month which he
was dedicating to football. Thus he
was at a disadvantage when he got
started——he had to play come-from-
behind.

He obviously was quite successful
in his efforts, but it brings about an
even more interesting question.

How much better can he become?
His accomplishments over the past
month would indicate that there is a
large amount of talent that has yet to
be tapped.

‘-‘The hurdle event is basically a
technique-oriented event," Lewis
said. “The great ones can make the
adjustments necessary—Roger is
one of those great ones. He is tre-
mendously talented athlete. And
without a doubt, he has proven that
he has as much heart andjcourage as
anybody; but he will be able to
improve.”

The amount of opportunities that
have opened for Kingdom since his
completion of the race on Saturday
-is unlimited.

This weekend he will begin com-
peting with the New Image Track
Club, coached by Elbert Kennedy,
at an invitational in Canada.

Another side of the multi-talented
Kingdom will be unveiled.

‘‘I’m going to compete in the deca-
thalon [an all-around competition
whic consists of 10 track and field
events—the long jump, the high

jump, the pole vault, the discus, the
shot put, the javelin, the 400-meter
dash, the I00-meter dash, the 1,500-
meter run and his specialty, the I I0-
meter high hurdles],” Kingdom said.

“If I do well, then I will begin work- ' I

ing and training in each ofthe events

for the Pan Am games later this .

SUHIITICT.

“I think that I can do pretty well in
the competition, and it would be
very nice to qualify in the decath/allon
if I experience difficulty in the
hurdles."

As for the Olympics,’ which within
a week have gone from a longshot

‘possibility to a foreseeable reality,

Kingdom will make the decision
later in the summer whether to con-
tinue with football or skip hisjunior
year in order to train solelyfor the
games.

He has already qualifed for the
Olympic trials next June in the
hurdles.

“There's no doubt about it, its
super for us,” Panther Coach John
Vasvary said over the phone from
his Virginia home, referring to the
effect of Kingdom’s qualiﬁcation on
the Panthers. “Our guys did a super
job, Roger’s performance was the tip
of the iceberg as far as the season is
concerned but we leave ’83 with five
All-Americas and a National
champ. That has to look good in
anybody’s eyes."

Kingdom‘s sucess opens doors for
the entire program in addition to his
personal availabilities.

Roger Kingdom

“We have felt as good about our
program from day one,” Lewis said.
“Roger’s accomplishment is just
proof that an athlete of his caliber
can improve, can reach goals or
heights by way of the Pitt program.
We have believed this since Sep-
tember, but now it's fact."

“There is going to be a lot of fun
things happening in Pitt track for
years to come. It's very exciting for
me.”

Academic Standards Don’t Make Grade 

I By JOE ZEFF

Two young black men strut the
inner city streets. One is very tall and
wears an old Ietterman ‘s jacket with
his name stitched to one side. The
other stands not quite as tall and
carries a large radio on his shoulder.

“Whassup, cool? Long time, no
see, ”greets the shorter man, extend-
ing his right hand for a high five and
lowering the volume on his stereo
with the other. "You playin’ some
hoops. dude?"

“Naw, man, "he answers in a soft
tone.

C ‘man, champ. ‘What are you tal-
kin’ about? You was the baddest
mug around when we played at the
school. You just gots to be jivin‘
me.”

"Naw. man, " he says again,
almost wishing he hadn ‘t stopped to
talk.-

Viewpoint

The conversation is fictional but
the story is all too real. A vicious
pattern has developed in which City
basketball players are wined and
dined by the collegiate coaches, but
fail to make it on campus. Black and
white" players alike.

Some can sink jumpshot after

jumpshot, but they just can’t score in
the classroom. In the city, all an ath-
lete must do in order to play is fail no
more than two classes.

But those grades just won’t make
the college admissions counselors as
happy as the high school athlete
directors. The athletes are uncere-
moniously sidetracked from his
delusions of grandeur and presented
a life of bent rims, no nets, and metal
backboards on the playground
circuit.

Carl Kohlman sought to change
all that. As director of the Ozanam
Cultural Center in the Hill District,
Kohlman was treated to a first hand
look at these prep players as their
futures were slam” dunked. He
recommended to the Board of Pub-
lic Education that a 2.0 quality point
average, or C average, requirement
be instituted for athletes.

“For a long time, it had been said
that the way black kids can get out of
the ghetto is through sports,” Kohl-
man said. “Maybe in some situa-
tions, but what happens when these
kids don’t make it to the big time?
We want these kids to be able to read
and write, not just dribble a
basketball.”

The Board of Education
approved new academic standards
for its athletes two weeks ago.
Instead of adopting Kohlman’s
plan, it__opted for a requirement of
five C’s in the preceding report
period in order to participate in
athletics. The athlete must have also
been promoted to the next grade.

Kohlman’s proposal of a straight
C average was shot down because as
Superintendent of Pupil Services
William Green states, “A C average
is tough to get.”

Oh, really? Superintendent of
Schools Richard C. Wallace and his
merrymen over on South Belleﬁeld
Avenue refused to place any confi-
dence in their students.

Kohlman’s plan was by far the
better of the two. The new require-
ments, which will be phased into the
system in the fall and will affect all
incoming students shows a failure of
the Pittsburgh Board of Public Edu-
cation to make a commitment to
better the educational standards of
the students, let alone the athletes.

The Board claims that the newtﬁsn

standards are “among the most
stringent in the country.” Let’s face
facts: It raised the academic stand-
ards for athletes to a 1.3 quality
point average, or D- average, and
failed to approve any kind of mea-
sure which would improve the
standing of athletes after
graduation.

Reflecting Ideas On Basking, Not Baking

By MARK. A. SINDLER

I know, and not necessarily
through the devices of extra-sensory
perception, that there will be some-
one somewhere who is going to open
up and say that I should have written
this piece, oh, late last March when
hordes of college groupies flocked to

that artificial paradise, Ft.
Lauderdale.
But, since my commitments

extend only so far, and since this is
supposedly the finest season of the
year, it is time for many [millions?]
of us to shed our outer garments,
and maybe some outer ﬂab, for the
healthy glow of the tan.

Viewpoint

    

As most of us start pulling
aluminum-framed lounge chairs
from the garage, attic or wherever,
and head for sandy beaches, grassy
knolls or (again) wherever, there are
some valuable tips and guidelines to
be followed in seeking a pro tan.

No matter how short their
memory is, many folks will disre-
gard past experience and attempt to
get tan as fast as possible. Even if it
means rising with the sun or forego-
ing the first two meals of the day, as
soon as the mercury rises above 60
degres, the unknowledgeable tanner
has it in him to be the first on the
block with a savage tan.

What that person gets is the first
case of searing sunburn. I know, I

was once that person. But only once; .

experience has taught me to keep the
trusty Solarcaine aerosal or a jar of
Vaseline nearby.

Now that the medical profession
has indeed proven that overexpo-
sure to the sun can lead to premature
aging of the skin and possibly even
skin cancer, the primary concern for
anyone first coming into contact
with the sun should be protection of
the face. Afterall, this is the one part
of the body seen as an index of the
aging process.

So, for those intent on looking

‘ young, watch out for your face.
Lotions concocted essentially for the
face should be used as should be eye

cups. In place of the eye coverings, it
is not an idiotic idea to place a folded
handtowel over the eyes and that
area under the eyes that is later the
site of baggy skin.

Face it——pardoning the pun—
either you go for the tan and faster
aging of the face, or opt for a lighter
looking facial feature and not as
much sun exposure. There is no
compromising.

As for the rest ofthe body, not too
much is at stake, unless you don't
mind losing some sleeping hours
because some unprotected areas
were introduced to a deep-frying
process. Just keep in mind that the
initial tanning stages have to be
approached on an incremental basis.
Don’t overindulge.

Once the good tanning base is
established, there really aren’t many
sunburn dangers. True, lotion
should always be used when out in
the sun and should be reapplied after
swimming or carousing in the salty
waves of an ocean or in a sheet-
s ooth lake. It is the next area of
w ich amateur tanners fail to take
note.

Post-tanning skin care cannot be
stressed enough. If this treatment is
not applied, the price wil be paid
later in life when the appearance of
the skin becomes associated with
prunes. Cocoa butter oils or any
other moisture-providing ointments
should be utilized to compensate for
the skin elasticity that was lost while
the sun dried it to a crisp.

Now that the gorgeous suntan has
been graciously spread over the
body with the consistency of butter
over bread, your laborious hours
spent on the beach or in the back-
yard have finally paid off. But do not
waste the moment to poor
marketing.

By this, 1 mean that if you got the
tan, then, by Lord, flash it. Proper
clothing is nothing short of essential.
Very light colored outerwear——
yellow, white and coordinations
along those lines——will do the trick
as the dark skin is contrasted
against the bright clothing.

For those people very conscious
of their hair, it would be very wise to

style it so as to highlight the blond

Joyce Aschenbrenner [left] will be leaving the corrpany of
Basketball SID Kimball Smith and Non-Revenue Sports SID
Linda Venzon for the top SID spot at Nevada-Las Vegas.

Aschenbrenner Moves Upln Hole

By scorr  

Pitt’s Football Sports Informa-
tion Director Joyce Aschenbrenner
will be giving up~the rolling hills of
Pittsburgh —an area in which she
has lived all her life—for the rolling
dice of Las Vegas.

That’s not exactly true. But
Aschenbrenner will assume the
sports information director’s duties
at the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas in the next two weeks.

“A couple weeks ago, they asked if
I was interested in the position,”
Aschenbrenner, who applied at
Nevada-Las Vegas, said. “I went out
for a visit and on (May) 31, they
offered me the job."

Positions on sports information
departments are dominated by
men——Aschenbrenner will be the
only woman currently serving at a
Division I football and basketball

university—but she has earned the g

spot as evidenced by her work at
Pitt.

\Aschenbrenner was the editor of a
football program named the best in
the nation in 1981 by College of
Sports Information Directors of
America (CoSIDA). The 1982 pro-
gram has already received 'top
honors in District II, which includes
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New
York and Washington, D.C.

Aschenbrenner graduated from
West Virginia University in 1974

with a bachelor's in journalism. A
few days later, she was working at a
Pitt track meet and has been work-
ing ever since.

“It was the greatest place to
learn,” Aschenbrenner said. “I grew
in talent, and the opportunities were
unbelievable.”

Since coming to Pitt,”Aschen-
brenner has covered seven bowl
games along with serving as public-
ity director for the 1979 AIAW
National Swimming and Diving
Championships at Trees Pool. But
along with the events she covered,
Aschenbrenner will also remember
the athletes—some the best ever
gracing the Oakland campus.

“I remember the National Cham-
pionship in I976 and seeing Pitt join
the Big East and what the league has
done to improve the program,” she
said. “But I always remember being
associated with super athletes like
Danny Marino, Matt Cavanaugh
and Sal Sunseri.”

Some would assume that people
majoring in journalism would have
an idea sometime during their col-
lege days of joining a newspaper or
something similar. But
brenner always wanted the job she
has held for 10 years. i

“I never wanted to be on a news-'
paper,” she said. “I worked under a
great guy like Dick Polen at West
Virginia as a st'udent assistant with
the Sports Information Office, and
this is what I wanted to do.

Aschen- M

. _\.

/'

“There is a great mix of duties_

here. Besides writing, you have to do
some public relations work and fund
raising. For the first time this year, I
produced the football highlight film.

“There’re not many jobs that give
such a variety.”

._ Now, Aschenbrenner will take off .
west to the deserts of Nevada, where

basketball and Jerry Tarkanian
reign.

But that is not all at Nevada-Las
Vegas. The university has a Division
I-A football program that competes
in the Western Athletic Conference
against teams like Hawaii and
Brigham Young.

“The football program is not
ready for Pitt,” Ashcenbrenner said.
“But basketball is real big. Next
year, the team is moving into the
Thomas Mack Areha, which has
18,000 seats. _ ' i

“There are very nice people out
there, and the university is only 25
years old.”

Although she has always been in
the Pittsburgh area, Aschenbrenner
believes it is time to move on.

“I have deep roots in this area, but
it's time to grow and looklfor new
things," she said. .

One thing Aschenbrenner will be
able to do at Nevada-Las Vegas is to
cheer for her alma mater, something
for which she received harassment
during her tenure at Pitt.

“But not Dec. 4,"she said. “That’s
when Nevada-Las Vegas plays West
Virginia in basketball.”

Highlighting Ideas

roots that became so because of con-
tinuous sunning. Sandy or brown
hair with blond roots is _ quite
appealing.

And, as a final dimension to con-
sider, be sure that the bathing suit
selection has been completed with
intelligent thought. A one-piece suit,
in the case of the female, is all but
sacrilegious as far as suntanning
goes. To use it is a travesty.

,For Darker Results

Good advice: The two-piece bik-
ini is the only suitable selection.

The tan proffers unlimited quali-
ties in offering a person a healthy
glow. t’sjust a wonder how fast that
tan fades when the summer ends;
after spending a healthy amount of

time to gain that glow in the first

place.

Bowen ﬁnds a home...

' Former Panther quarterback,
defensive back and hot recruit Rich
Bowen, 6-2, 215 lbs., announced he
will transfer to Youngstown State
next fall.

Bowen, who was a former Parade
All-America quarterback at Serra
High School, was recruited by Pitt
as a quarterback, but was switched
to defensive back midway through

. the 1982 season. He decided to leave ‘

Pitt in April after spring practice.
Under NCAA rules, he will have
to sit out the 1983 season, but begin-

* ning in the 1984 season, he will have
4 three seasons of eligibility left.

’ Bowen picked Youngstown ove
Penn State and Edinboro. ’

Tourney Time...

West Virginia University will be
the site of the 1984 Atlantic 10 Con-
ference basketball championship
tournament, March 8-10, as recently
announced by Atlantic 10 Commis-
sion Leland ‘Byrd.

WVU was approved as the host of
the 1984 tournament following a
vote among the member schools’
athletic directors. Rutgers is sche-
duled to host the 1985 conference
tournament, completing a two-year,

. on-campus site plan.

‘ -“I feel that moving the tourna-
ment to an on-campus site is our
most feasible alternative at this
time," Byrd said, not elaborating on
other overtures.

“Being on campus provides us
with greater control of television
rights as well as additional flexibility
in establishing a tournament format.
We have examined numerous pro-
posals over the past several months
and feel that this two-year plan is in
the best interest of all of our
members."

The top eight teams in the Atlan-
tic 10 will converge in the 14,000-
seat WVU Coliseum to battle for the
conference title and an automatic
bid to the 52-field NCAA
Tournament.

Recruiting Time...

Georgetown’s Cheryl Thompson

wasted little time fortifying her ros-
ter, after recently being named new
coach of the women's basketball
squad.
_ Assistant athletic director
Nathalie Paramskas recently
announced the intention of three
highly-touted scholastic players to
bring a variety of experience to the
Lady Hoyas.

The latest additions to the first-
year coach’s roster will be: Ronda
Bliey, a 6-0 forward from Schenec-
tady, N.Y.: Ann Marie Gothard, a

6-2 forward/ center from Utica,
Mich.; and Christine Cwieka, a 5-10
forward from Clark, N.J.

Bliey, a graduate of Guilderland
Central, averaged 13 points and 11
rebounds per game.

Gothard averaged 15.2 ppg and
came up with nine rebounds per
game as a senior at Eisenhower High I
School. She was named to the All-
Macomb Athletic Conference first
team, the All-Macomb County first
team, the Detroit News All—State,
Class A second team and was an
All-Metropolitan Detroit honorable
mention selection. '

Gothard shot 62 percent from the
floor and led her team to the
Macomb Athletic Conference
championship and to the state
semiﬁnals.

Cwieka averaged 12.1 ppg, and
managed eight rebounds and five
assists per game at A.L. Johnson
High School. As a senior, Cwieka
was named team MVP, first-team
All-Union County and second-team
All-State,bGroup II.

Considered an all-around athlete,
Cwieka was also heavily recruited as
a volleyball player.

Time For A Change...

When the men's and women’s
basketball seasons begin later this
year at Georgetown, there will be
two Thompsons coaching the Hoya
squads. '

Cheryl Thompson, former head
coach at W.T. Woodson High

School in Fairfax, VA., was recently ”

tagged the new coach of the Lady
Hoyas.

The men's varsity squad is
coached by John Thompson. Both
teams are members of the Big East.

A coach at Woodson for the past
seven years, Thompson led her team
this past season to a 27-1 record, the
Virginia Class AAA State Cham-
pionship and a No. 4 ranking in
USA Today. She was named the
1982 D.C. Metropolitan Area
Coach of the Year by The Washing-
ton Post. .

In March 1983, she coached the
Virginia All-Stars to a victory over
the Maryland/ D.C. All-Stars in the
McDonald’s Capital Classic. It
marked the third consecutive year
Thompson had been chosen to
coach the team. ‘

Thompson replaces former Lady
Hoya coach ~ Mary Briese, who
turned in a two-year stint at
Georgetown. , -

As well as hailing from Oriental,
N.C., Thompson is a 1972 graduate
of East Carolina University where
she was a two-time MVP in
basketball.
