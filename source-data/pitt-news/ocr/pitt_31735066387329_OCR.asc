Writer of anonymous letter not
satisfied with investigation of SGB

By Teresa Candori
Contributing Editor

A suspected abuse of SGB
funds by Delta Tau Delta frater-
nity was resolved in early July,
but the issue resurfaced recently
with the distribution of an anony-
mous letter urging student organi-
zations to compel an investigation.

The letter, which suggested that
SGB funds had been diverted to
pay for the mailing of invitations
to a Delt party, was distributed
approximately two weeks ago to
the leaders of campus organiza-
tions and to all fraternities and
sororities.

The Pitt News reported in ear-
ly July that invitations received by
some sorority members bore the
mailing stamp of the SGB; The
stamp indicated that the invita-
tions were mailed through the
university, with the-cost of the

mailing chargedto the SGB.
According to SGB president
and Delt brother Phil Moyer, the
Delts issued a check in the
amount of $12.10 to the Student
Government to cover the mailing
costs. Assistant Director of Stu-
dent Activities and SGB Adviser
Joyce Giangarlo confirmed hav-
ing received the check on June 9.
Both Giangarlo and Bridget
Guernsey, Greek adviser, said
that they were satisfied that the
matter had been resolved back in
June. ”As far as we're [the Office
of Student Activities] all con-
cerned, it has been handled and
handled appropriately,” Gian-
garlo said, adding that she was
”amazed” that someone is appar-
ently trying to drag out an issue
that has long been resolved.’
Moyer said the matter was be-
coming a ”non-issue.”
’’I don't think the letter had any

validity because the person didn't
sign it,” he said. ’’If he's so con-
cerned about the matter he
should come forward and make
a public statement himself. I'd be
more than happy to discuss it
with him.

”l’ve taken responsibility for
my actions. I think he should do
the same,” Moyer ' said.

The letter distributed to the
university groups made no men-
tion of the fact that the Delts had
reimbursed the SGB. Despite the
July 1 Pitt News article, which
made this fact known, the letter

suggested the matter had been-

left unresolved.

”A possible diversion of SGB
funds is being investigated.  The
Pitt News is currently looking
into this matter. Your organiza-
tion must compel a full investiga-
tion into this issue in the coming
fall,” the letter read.

¢

Enclosed with the letter was a
copy of the July 1 Pitt News arti-
cle concerning the original inci-
dent. The newspaper’s masthead
had been pasted above the arti-
cle to create the impression that
the article had been on the front
page. The article had, in fact, ap-
peared on page three.

The Pitt News had not been
conducting an‘investigation of
the matter and issued a statement
to university organizations in-
dicating that the information con-
tained in the letter was incorrect
and that The Pitt News had not
been involved in the distribution
of the letter.

The author or authors of the let-
ter have not yet been identified.
”There are suspicions,” Guern-
sey said.

Guernsey had been contacted

Underage drinkers remain
problem for Oakland bars

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Underage drinking remains a
reality even though laws concern-
ing legitimate proof of age are be-

-coming more stringent.

Charles Nucci, owner of C]

Barney's, Hemmingway’s and

Zelda's, said ”Young people, in
an attempt to find an outlet to
have some fun  are always [try-
ing to get] into a place that serves
alcoholic beverages and have
some fun.”

Nucci said that he doesn't be-
lieve that underage drinking is
any worse than it has been in the
past. Phony ID cards are a major
problem that he has to deal with
in his bars.

”People are always trying to
falsify some records in order to
gain admittance to the different
bars. They [the fake IDs] are not
always easy to spot; that's what
makes it difficult.”

According to Nucci, a lot of
people are getting a driver's Ii-

Freshmen — especially at a

Sheepskin prices

are going up again

As students study their bills for the current term at Pitt, they
will no doubt notice that tuition has been raised yet again.
In an economy that continually demands increased funding

I to retain the status quo, Pitt has nudged higher the cost of mem-

bership in the club of higher education.

While the checks are being written to pay for this adventure,
one can only hope that we will not be witness to a crop of un-
dergraduates shouldering the ever-higher costs of the college
education and receiving nothing more than a degree without
promise. _

The name of an established university can greatly increase
.a new graduate’s chance of survival‘ in the.l'tar,dened.world of
corporate America.

Pitt, we are to assume, is trying to build such a reputation
for itself. There are new schools and slogans sprouting like dan-
delions across the campus.

there once was a man
with immeasurable wit
who liked to claim
that Pitt was it.

For now, it isn't.

Gary Hart returns
to the painful light

It appears that the story isn't yet over. It appears that the Ameri-
can political system has again begun to function, allowing those
most qualified to remain in the race for the office of the Presi-
dent. Gary Hart, if his campaign managers are to be believed,
is going to re-enter the decimated field of Democrats for 1988.

I And not a moment too soon.

When the Miami Herald published a story concerning the
whereabouts of Donna Rice over the period of a weekend, Gary
Hart fell prey to the soap-opera consciousness of the Ameri-
can public.

In the scandal that ensued, he was lauded as a hero, dis-
paraged as a farce and cast out like so much rotting garbage.
He became a tangible example of the debauchery associated
with the Kennedys. He was an adulterer, he was a liar, he was
not George Washington, or at least he did not have the image
most of us prefer to associate with first president.

He, as we all remember so well, dropped from the race to
lick his wounds in private, finding that the harsh glare of the
media's camera lights reveal too much.

But, like MacArthur, he might return. Since his campaign
machinery shut down, there has been a void in the Democrat-
ic party that has simply been too much for a handfull of home-
boys and smiling, cardboard cut-outs to fill.

A need for a candidate of substance can be seen each time
the field of second-stringers is evaluated. Some of the names
even remain a mystery to the public.

But, there may be justice. lust maybe, somewhere in the midst
of the deafening breast-beating that has passed for campaign
rhetoric in recent months, a voice of reason will again be heard.

ell, well. Another

year begins, and a

whole ‘new crop of

map—readers and
Fifth Avenue phobics enters upon
the hallowed grounds of .Pan-
therland.

Hello freshmen and welcome
to Pitt.

I know what you're thinking.
Your thoughts right now are rang-
ing anywhere from, ”Jesus, what
fun I'm having,” to, "There is no
way I'll ever be able to take a
shower with all these weirdosliv-
ing with me." From, "How do I
get the pass keys to the floors of
the opposite sex," to, ”I wonder
if I'll flunk out by November?”

Well, although I could proba-
bly advise you on the previous
concerns, my job now is to try
and enlighten you so that the lat-
ter can be scratched right out of
your minds. After all, my friends

_and I went through the exact

same situations way back in
198(Cood God, has it been this
Iong?)3.

Even though you_are having
what is arguably tne best time
you have ‘ever had at this
moment, the one thing that must
be kept in mind is that, in the
peoples’ eyes who are funding
this glorious adventure (namely,
your parents), you are here for
only one reason -— an education.

So, in order to avoid the fatal
diseases of droopy eyelid lecture
syndrome and chronic dregs
CPA, here are some of the better
courses and/or professors you
may wish to take during your
years here at this prestigious
pageant of corporate academia.

(Note: The following courses
and/or professors are listed
because,‘ instead of the normal
routine, they are thought-
provoking and advantageous to
your intellectual being and not
because they are assumed to be
easily passed, ”cake-o"
excursions.)

0 Anything taught by Ted
Windt — Basically, Ted is one of
the best examples of what true
and good education is all about.

Any of his classes, from Pres
Rhet to Cynicism, are gems. And
the best part is, he allows you to

think. _

0 Music 84 -- Jazz/Dr. Nathan
Davis —- This is not just a class
about jazz and its history; it is an
honor for Pitt studentsto be able
learn about the subject from an
experienced master.

If the subject ‘interests you in
even the most remote way, take
this course. Davis will enthrall
you, and you'll be able to enjoy
some of the sweetest music this
side of the Delta. '

0 Anthropology 80 — Intro to
Cultures/Dr. Richard Scaglion —»
A class that is about all of us. And
remember, Scaglion looks most
like Gene Hackman.

0 Sociology 139 — Vietnam
War and Intervention/Dr.

I Ierome Laulicht — Probably one

of the best classes not only at Pitt
but anywhere in the country.

Laulicht, a prominent figure in
the military industrial complex at
the time of the war, provides a
fascinating panorama on one of
the premier shaping forces of a
generation and those yet to
come.

And in these days of Contragate
and Rambo idealisms, I personal-
ly feel this class is a must.

0 Economics 80 — Intro to
Economics/Dr. Reuben Slesinger
-— A good and informative class
that provides basic knowledge
about the theories that are actu-
ally realities controlling your
future.

° Anything taught by Bill
Searle —— Poet, pundit, sage. Pitt's
own Ben Franklin. Searle is all of
these, and his classes, ranging
anywhere from American Lit to
Monsters: Human and inhuman,
both instruct and enchant. To
take him is a treat. E‘

0 English Lit 103 — Satire/Dr.
Christopher Rawson :.-:.-Qn'e,of
the most enjoyable courses you'll
ever be able to take. The concen-
tration is on certain pieces of
respective art forms (film, litera-
ture, art, music) that are ‘more
than a little skeptical and poke
fun at all of the rest. But remem-
ber, Rawson is the person to take
it from." ' '

’.°_' English Lit 1'62 — Literature
of Sports/Dr. Robert Marshall —
If you're a sports fan and know a
lot about the subject, you'll enjoy
this course solely for the subject
matter. But even‘ if you don't
know the difference between a
football and a tennis racket, you'll
still be able to hone your literary
analysis skills and learn more
about America's pastimes in
depth through the novels Mar-
shall covers (i.e. North Dallas 40,
The Natural).

0 Current Problems 16 —
Human Sexuality — Everybody
thinks about it. Everybody enjoys
doing it. Why not take this class
that will at least examine some of
the myths about it and provide
factual evidence about the reali-
ty of the subject matter.

0 Political Science 180 --
Human Nature/Dr. [ohn Chap-
man — An in-depth study of what
makes man think and, in turn,
react the way he does. Fascinat-
ing yet, at times, brutally difficult.
Take this one when you have
some extra time on your hands.

College is a lot of fun, whether
you find it through classes, a
fraternity or just friends. You've
only got to remember one thing
— there is a lot of responsibility,
primarily academic, that goes
along with it. Take care, and I’l
see you in Zelda's. -

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 

 

 

More than drunken revelry

reek life at Pitt consists

of many things. Sorori-

ties and fraternities are

social organizations,
but they have a lot more than par-
ties to offer.

When someone chooses to
join a particular chapter, they
begin as a pledge. The pledge
period is a time to learn about the
history of the national organiza-
tion, to get to know the members
of the chapter and serves as an
interim in which each person
decides whether he/she wants to
become a member of the chapter.

Whether or not to join is not
always an easy decision. Due to
the fact that Pitt has 34 sororities
and fraternities, it is difficult to
meet each member in every
chapter while going through
Rush. Meeting and talking with as
many members as possible,
though, will enable you to decide
where you feel most comfortable.

I don't believe Greek life is for
everyone, because there is a lot
of give-and—take involved. If you

want to be a contributing mem- ‘
ber, you will need to put time

into it. Some members contribute
by holding offices in their chap-
ters, by helping with their chap-
ter's philanthropy or by getting
themselves and others involved
in campus activities. We've all
heard the saying, "The more you
put into something, the more you
will get out of it." This same idea

Juoldstrue here.

Members become more res-
ponsible as they work to improve

' their chapters. Holding an office

or being chairperson of a com-
mittee enables "members to
develop leadership skills.- In
addition, and perhaps most
important to those of us entering
the job market, members will
develop invaluable social and

  

 

Iv ,.

PANHEL PRESIDENT

communication skills from inter-
acting with such a large and
diverse group of people.

Don't get me wrong — it's’ not
all work and no play. There are
mixers with fraternities and other
sororities, formals to attend, hay-
rides to enjoy, dance marathons
to survive  the list goes on and
on. -

But it doesn't all end when you
graduate. When you join a soror-
ity or fraternity, you become a
lifetime member of its national

. organization. Alumni continue to

contribute by advising chapters,
providing scholarships for under-
graduate and graduate students,
and in some cases, by providing
job contacts. -

Looking back on the past three
years, I have gathered many
memories ranging from formals
to late—night study sessions.
When I was going through Rush,
I wasn't sure if a sorority was right

for me. I went through Rush out‘

of curiosity, because I didn't
know the first thing about what
being "Greek" meant. When I
graduate at the end of this year,
I will leave here knowing that I
have contributed to my chapter,
to theuniversity and to the com-
munity.

I have given much of myself,

but have received much in
return. The same opportunity is
now being offered to you. This
column is not meant to convince
you that Greek life is right for
everyone, yet it may not be right
for you. But, if you are looking for
something more in your years
here at Pitt, consider looking into
our 34 Greek chapters. You'll be
suprised at how muchyou can
discover aboutyourself — I was.

~ the answer is a resounding no.

There are sensible reasons for
keeping an open federal system,
the first of which involves ac-
countibility. How do we know
who we are electing, and how do
we know that they are acting in
the best interests of the country
if we don't even know what they
are doing?

The military leads this congen-
ital double life. On the surface,
they are well-groomed and
primed young men with a heck
of a lot of devotion to the coun-
try. Beneath the surface, they are
profiteers, incompetents, para-
noid and often counter-
productive.

There are so many dangers that

_ can come from giving the military

too free a hand. This is because
they don't want, or don't dare to
tell, the people what they are

really doing ,in the ,,name, of,
national security. Therefore, few

people know that El Salvador was
allied with the Axis Tripartite
(Hitler"s Germany, Italy and
Japan) during World War II. Peo-
ple accept that America would
never be ’permitted to be
governed by people who are fun-
damentally hostile to American
liberty and constitutional
democracy. So if a president says
let's arm El Salvador to the teeth,
it can't possibly mean that we are
siding with genocide and dic-
tatorship.

Now this is where Contragate
becomes relevant and
exceedingly important. I want to
emphasize that there is an impor-
tant principle here. The National
Security Council circumvented
the entire State Department in
pursuit of a policy that was wrong

and substantially illegal. Regard- ,'

less of the personal qualities of
Ollie North, D this was under-
handed and vicious. It was almost
certainly one of many other inci—-

dents that were never.detected._

 

secrecy

What if AIDS were a biological
weapon, and I'm not saying that‘
I have any proof of this, but it sim-
ply must make you wonder. How
would we know? Who would in-
vestigate? If the American people
can't find out what its own mili-
tary is doing, how can we know
what other countries, often more
vicious countries, are doing?

There is a philosophical strug-
gle in human nature being played
out in politics, the struggle
between honesty and bold lies. In
politics, powerful individuals ex-
pect to make decisions on the
basis ofimisleading information
and deceive the public in the
process, all without harming our
national interests. This is, basical-
ly, a lunatic syndrome.

Did you know, for example,
that in El Salvador, a country that
Reagan has allied to the United

States for all the world to see, the ‘

military destroyed the national
history in the national library,
which they found embarassing.
Does this sound edifying for the
prospects of human history?‘

There is nothing  
new Under the sun

he most valuable

piece of advice I can

pass along to you,

speaking as an upper
classman to freshmen, is that
all of the advice contained in
these pages is questionable, at
best. Well-intentioned, but
questionable.

There is nothing new under
the sun. That's either from the
Bible or Shakespeare, and if
you pay close attention for the
next founyears, you might find
out which it is. The point is,
there’s,nothing we can say that
you haven't already heard 
from your guidance counselor
or your parents or your older brother, and none of it, none of : '
it, can possibly prepare you for the College Experience. I I

This is not The Breakfast Club. Some of us might be better
off locked in a library fora while, but the emotional hype of

' a heart-to-heart bull session with the gang in the dorm is not
the life-altering event it may at first seem.

They tellyou that "the friends you meet in college are the
friends you'll keep allyour |ife." Sure, but you may not even ;
meet the friends in question until your third year. _

This is not Animal House. Those of you who. choose the
Greek life, and even those who don't, will discover that it isn't
all sex and beer and parties. Although it is that, too. But if that's
all it is, it won't last long. You may find yourself wandering the

I streets of Oakland with a Styrofoam cup in your hand, asking :
passersby, "Spare any change?"

Your relationships with your schoolmates, whether you and

, your roommate in the Towers end up buddies for life’ or you
wind up loathing each other by midterms, whether you decide
to dedicate your life to a fraternity or sorority, or vow to re-
main a GDI (ask someone at the Watermelon Picnic) is impor-
tant; but it's’ secondary. I " ' i ‘  '   ‘

All of your experiences, in and out of the classroom, with‘
friends and enemies and total strangers, drunk or sober, in sick-
ness and in health, ‘will have but one common effect 6n you
— they will help to turn you into the person you are going to
spend the rest of your life being. '

Very few ofus arrive at college with a clear idea of what our
goals are. Most of those who have chosen a major will change,
it a dozen times before all is told. Absolutely positive of what
you're going to be when you're fininshed? Three cheers for am-
bition and determination, but don't be so rigid and narrow-_-
minded that you exclude viable possibilities.

Welcome to the place where you'll do most of your growing
up. If you're doing it right, you'll never stop, but the next few -
years will probably change you more than the last 10 and the
next 10 combined.

I turned 21 a few weeks ago, and though I'm an adult in the
eyes of the law, personally, I have my‘doubts. But the person
I was when I was 18 would seem a stranger to me, if I hadn't
spent the last three years with her. I

So, for the next‘few weeks, when upperclassmen give you
a hard time and actall superior, keep in mindthat: a) you won't
be a freshman forever; b) they won't keep it up all semester; '
and c) you will do the same thing next year; oh, and (I) you
guys honestly do look a little bit silly with your little maps and
brand-new backpacks and your keys and IDs on strings around
your necks. But what the hell, so did we.

But the novelty wears off fast. Midterms will be here before
you know it. And when you're cramming at 3 in the morning
for the third night in a row, remember that it's not just the materi-
al you're studying that constitutes your schoo|i_ng; it's the peo-
ple you study with, even where you study and, perhaps, the
fact that you're studying at 3 a.m. It's the music you're listen-
ing to while you study and the party you gave up (or didn't give
up) to study. It's where you will go when you're finished study-
ing, and what you'd rather be doing than studying. Or even. ’
the fact that you're studying (or not studying) at all.

Most of us are here to get a degree. Some of us will also end
up with an education. ‘

MANAMA, Bahrain — Iraq said Tues-
day its warplanes attacked four ships in

‘ “the Persian.Gulf and raided two Iranian

cities. Iran claimed it downed three Iraqi

_ fighter jets —— two in a dogfight over the

gulf.

-Two re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers safely
reached Kuwaiti waters today, escorted
by U.S. warships after a three-day voyage

in ‘I through the gulf. It was the sixth convoy
I escorted by U.S. ships since the Reagan

administration decided to prot_ect I1
Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack.
Also today, the Pentagon said the USS

' Guadalcanal rescued an Iraqi pilot who
1 had been adrift in the gulf on a raft since

his jet fighter was shot down Saturday.
The pilot said he believed his plane was
downedby an Iranian missile. _
Analysts said Tuesday that Iraq would
" benefit most from a ceasefire in the war

 . because Baghdad is in the midst of a

financialcrisis.
Iran has repeatedly refused to go along
- with a drafted ceasefire resolution, saying
it would do so only after the two super-
. powers pulled all military forcesfrom the
~ Persian Gulf.
Also Tuesday, talk began to grow of
passage of a United Nations Security

-Council Resolution that would force an

immediate halt to the Gulf war, with even

‘such a move. _ V

FDA approves new drug

which lowers cholesterol

I WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug
Administration announced approval
Tuesday of a cholesterol-lowering
prescription drug called lovastatin.

The agency saidthe new drug may be

especially helpful for patients with very

high cholesterol levels stemming from in-
herited tendencies as .opposed to dietary
habits.

Nonetheless, the long-awaited drug —,

which the FDA says is the first of a new
class of highly effective‘ cholesterol-
lowering agents — is likely to prove popu-
lar among hundreds of thousands of peo-
ple with elevated cholesterol‘ levels, no
matter what the reason for the elevation.

Lovastatin will be labeled as being in-
tended for use in conjunction with a strict
diet and only when diet and exercise
alone have not reduced cholesterol suffi-
ciently.

However, once the FDA approves any
drug for sale, doctors are free to prescribe
it as they see fit.

In clinical studies, the FDA said lovasta- .

tin reduced total cholesterol by 18 to 34
percent, depending on dosage, and
reduced the particularly dangerous low-
density lipo)rotein, or LDL cholesterol,
by 19 to 39J percent.

a

' THE PITT News, Wedlnesdciy, ‘September 2, I987

Conversely, the agency said levels of
so—called ”good” cholesterol, high-
density lipoproteins, increased by 3 to 13
percent.

”The drug may prove a useful addition
in the fight against coronary heart disease,
our No. I cause of death,” said FDA
Commissioner Frank E. Young in a state-
ment announcing the approval.

Leaking tank forces people.

to evacuate in Homewood

PITTSBURGH — Authorities say a leak-
ing_tank at a service station probably was
the source of about 500 gallons of gaso-
line that forced the evacuation of about
100 people.

The gasoline mixed with water in the .

basement of a vacant, three-story home
in the city's Hill District neighborhood
and authorities evacuated several Centre
Avenue homes and businesses for sever-
al hours Monday.

Assistant_Fire Chief Kevin Mellott said
he believed the gasoline leak came from
tanks at Bean's Gulf service station near-
by. He ordered the station closed until

pressure tests ‘can be done on storage

tanks and pump lines.

Garbage barge unloaded;
bundles of trash burned A

NEW YORK -— The burning of the na-
tion's best-known trash began Tuesday af-
ter one-ton bales from the garbage barge

by workers in masks and white suits.

Culftension mounts as Iran-Iraq war goes on

Environmental inspectors from the city
and state probed the garbage with tiny
rakes but found little more than paper,
cardboard, wood and typical commercial
garbage.

City Sanitation Commissioner Brendan
Sexton predicted that the 3,186 tons of
baled refuse would be burned into 400
tons of ash to be buried at a Long Island
landfill within two weeks.

The barge left-New York on March 22
with commercial waste from New York
City and neighboring Nassau County on
Long Island. ' _

The cargo was turned away from a pri-
vate landfill in North Carolina before start-

ing a 6,000-mile trip that brought“

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 2, T987

extend a welcome to the
ambitious, enchanted and
perhaps even slightly
confused freshmen, as
well as a welcome back to the
seasoned upperclassmen.
George Bernard Shaw once
said, ”You don't learn to hold
your own in the world by stand-
ing on guard, but by attacking
and getting well-hammered your-
self.” As a student, then, you
have a unique world, for the ex-
perience of this university
presents you with the occasion to
attack and get hammered without
getting hurt.
These four years of your life
serve as a proving ground for

, your opinions, curiosities and

‘dreams. It is an occasion of which

_ I recommend you take full ad-

vantage.

As the president of the under-
graduate student government, I
found a priceless insight into the
world beyond the gates of col-
lege. It is an insight that can be
discovered in all student activi-
ties. This impression will serve
not only to complete your educa-
tion but also to yield a great many
bonds that will last long after your

potential
unrelated
to income

By Rich Kirkpatrick
Associated Press Writer
School-by-school results from
statewide math and reading tests
show poverty is not an obstacle
to learning, Education Secretary
Thomas Gilhool said Monday.

Data from the Testing for Essen- |

tial Learning and Literacy Skills
show that some schools with high
percentages of low—income chil-
dren have significantly improved
their test scores since the program
started in 1984.

Gilhool said 47 schools with a
higher-than-average number of
low—income pupils recorded 80
to 100 percent of all pupils pass-
ing the TELLS tests.

However, the figures from
across the state generally show
the wealthier suburban and rural
districts hold the highest percen-
tage of pupils passing the tests.
Only four of the top 50 districts
were in low—income areas, Gil-
hool said.

He also noted that in 33 of the
top 50 districts, 11 to 17 percent
of the pupils failed the tests.

’’In the higher-performing dis-

v tricts, there is work to be done as

well,” Gilhool said in a ‘tele-
phone interview. ‘ ’

Gilhool released a package of
10 reports that showed TELLS
results for every school in the
state and various rankings based

- on whether a district's passing

-rates have risen or fallen since
1984.

He said he released the results
to pinpoint the successes in edu-
cation and to persuade others to

‘copy their winning ways.

”lt’s important for people to be
able to draw on what is going
well,” Gilhool said. ”We've got
to get all schools in that po-
sition.”

Gilhool said he has placed the

days of classes.

In student government, a great
deal of this bonding is created
through involvement in campus,
state and national concerns. It is
among persons who are in the
process of solidifying and explor-
ing impressions on a large scope
of issues. The issues with which
we deal have ranged from indiv-
idual student's questions to mil-
lions of dollars in state bills and
proposed national cuts in student
aid. At this point, I'm tempted to
say that we'll work together to
resolve anything at any time in
the interest of the students of this
university.

The Student Government
Board is a campus-elected body
comprised of eight members:
Vince Altomare, Fiora Boehm,
Rose Cardone, Amy Danziger,
George Kontos, Therese McFad-
den, Pamela Rich and a presi-
dent, myself. There are seven
standing committees under the
auspices of the board, each head-
ed by an appointed chairperson.
They are: Affirmative Action,
Allocations, Elections, Freshman
Council, Governmental Rela-
tions, Judicial Board and Student

Relations. Each of these is open
to membership either through
appointment or attendance.
Throughout the year, both the
board and the standing commit-
tees direct their energies toward
serving the student body.

  

PHIL

MOYER
SGB PRESIDENT

In the winter term this past
year, we engaged the talents of
the entire student governmentto
provide a number of services. If
you will allow me a moment to
boast, we list as victories a free

Cu

legal consultation service, an
increase in the Student Activities
Fee, weekly phone polling, cam-
pus suggestion boxes, a radio talk
show, a free weekend student
leadership conference, a success-
ful lobbying campaign against
President Reagan's proposed
education cuts and an update and
reprinting of the Handicapped
Student Access Guide.

Of course, these were all ideas
that took effect in the winter term.
We now have before us the task
of maintaining the pace we've
set. Therefore, I would like to
take this opportunity to formally
announce a few projects that
have been in the works this sum-
mer and will be employed
throughout the fall and winter
terms.

Kontos has created a free taxi
service. on weeknights from 10
p.m. to 12:30 a.m. and on
weekends from 10 p.m. to 1:30
a.m. We have initiated Pitt's first
ever campus-wide Crime Watch.
Altomareis compiling the first
comprehensive student phone
directory in 10 years. Cardone is
working to provide an accredit-
ed class that will serve to inform

7

students of the latest health issues
including AIDS and drug abuse.

Rich has innovated the first—ever . 

used-book exchange, which will

_ operate out of our office. Boehm

and McFadden are investigating
the possibilities of a student credit
union, while Naro will be head-
ing up planning for a university
nightclub.

The Governmental Relations
Committee has salvaged ‘the
Alliance of Pennsylvania Student

Governments and is creating a 

lobbying campaign to generate
support for an equipment bill cur-
rently under consideration in
Harrisburg.

The list can go on for quite
some time, but I'll leave the rest
for unveiling at a later date.

These pieces of business are

primarily focused on the vision of

the students. However, we have
another audience,_ as well as
another task. That is the represen-
tation of the student body tothe

cure for marriage-shy man

  range) W35 Wrong The dime”

Q: A lot of males ask you fear-
ful questions about being too
small sexually. Perhaps it would
help them to understand that
there are men who are too well-
endowed and this can cause per-
formance problems. I am too
large. I mean, in what doctors
have told me is the freak range.

As a result, my sex life is down
to nothing, and it worries me a
lot. My male friends know about
this and kid me, which is under-
standable. They are not sadistic,
but it doesn't help. Should I ad-
vertise for a capacious woman?

A: Advertising that way is not
out of the question, but I think
there are better things for you to
do. Anyone who writes as
thoughtfully as you is going to be
interested in the personality, the
companionability, of a woman
more than her internal
dimensions. .

I do not say a woman who is
largeldown there might not be

T

charming, a friend, a strong ally,
interest sharing, and so on. But
you really should look for those
personality traits first. I think that
a woman with a generous under-
standing is more important than
one with a big physical capacity.

I think you should have a talk
with a sex therapist because this
problem, less common than the
chiefly attitudinal problem of the
man who thinks he is too small,
is still known to us, and we have
established ways to deal with it.
The therapist can assure you that
you are not freakish, and you do
need to be told that.

I tell you so now, butyou need
more confidential conversation
on the subject than just telling
you in print. That doctor (and I
find it hard to believe that a doc-

sion you mention, which I have
omitted here because people
have to stop emphasizing size.

The therapist can recommend
positions for intercourse that will
be better for both you and the
woman, and also ways for you to
change your attitude and ways to
talk to your partner about it. If
you have a regular partner, and
I hope you do because that is al-
ways helpful in sex therapy,
perhaps you and she should see
the therapist together.

I wish there were none of this
male kidding about the subject,
but I am too realistic to think it
will stop. You at least know that
it is harmful and will not kid
another person about a physical
attribute, right? And, if you want
to, you might say to other men,
”That kind of kidding isn't as fun-
ny as it is supposed to be, and
maybe I can take it, but I do think
highly of the sort of guy who

Forum isn't quite
the Cesear ofplays

By Susan Washburn over lines and lyrics were

Entertainment Editor

The plot is simple. Hero falls in
love. His‘ girl is inaccessible, and
a friend vows to bring them
together. Everything about the
script A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum seems
common.‘ In fact, that's exactly
how the production at the Mar-
ket Square Theatre comes off —
common.

The Market Square Theatre has
found the usual mixture of talent-
ed and semi-talented performers
to participate in Forum. The
production isn't boring, it just
never reaches beyond the point
of average.

The antics of Pseudolus, as he
tries to unite Hero and Philia,
wreack havoc on the relatively‘
mundane. There are men dressed
as women, old ladies disguised as
innocent maidens and a chase
scene that has virtually the entire
cast running round and round the
stage. _

Ray Cupples Jr. as Pseudolus is

obvious.

Despite the desprate attempts
of Pseudolus to unite Hero and
Philia the couple remains apart;
Hero (Robert C. Edgar) is lost in
love. Unfortunately, Edgar’s
character is too affected and ef-
feminate. He is, though, one of
the most outstanding singers.

Charlene Shaw as the innocent
Philia is wonderfully naive, and

her sweet voice completes her

characterization. Also giving a_
notable performance is John
Skolits as the eccentric father of
Hero (Senex). In the number
”Everybody Ought to Have a
Maid,” Skolits shines as he sings
of Senex’s fantasies.

A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum also in-
cludes some obvious first-time
performers in the chorus. ‘The
shuffling feet and darting eyes
reveal their inner nervousness.

New film leave Costner withNo Way Out  

By William Young

Staff Writer

Apparently, the new film starring Kevin
Costner is supposed to be hot. Unfor-
tunately, No Way Out refers more to the
predicament the producers put them-
selves in when they released this movie
than it does to any of the characters.

Now, any normal person would think
that dressing one of Hollywood's hottest
actors, Kevin Costner, in a Navy uniform
and casting him opposite a beautiful
brunette, Sean Young, and then having
him get in trouble with the government
would beget a good picture. Get the
picture?

A little confused, well, you should be
as No Way Out is perhaps one of the most
odd movies to come out in a while. The

. trouble all starts when the credits have

stopped rolling and the first two minutes
of the movie pass. The movie jumps from
present to past. The real action takesplace
two months into the past. This explains
why Costner is all beat up when the
movie starts because the action hasn't.

Enter Commander Tom Farrell (Costner) "

in a navy dress uniform, who runs into an

old friend from college (Will Patton) who

works for the Secretary of Defense, David
Brice (Gene Hackman). From across the
crowded ballroom, Costner catches love-
ly Sean Young's eyes and strolls over to
meet her.

He easily picks her up, and they head
off to her limousine where they engage
in this summer's most talked-about sex
scene. Throughout the next 25 minutes
he has sex with Young a few more times,
finds out his boss is also having sex with
her and takes her on a vacation to have

more sex with her.

Costner and Young confuse all this mat-
ing with love. Eventually, they decide that
they should tell Brice to beat it, but not
tonight because he's walking up to her
apartment and Costner has to sneak out
the back door.

Brice flies into a jealous rage when he
finds out about his mistress’ new flame
and accidentally slaps her over the ban-
nister. Distraught over his actions, Brice

goes to his aide’s house where the over- .

zealous little twerp convinces him to in-
vent a love triangle involving a Russian
mole employed at the Pentagon as the
murderer. They take their little plot and
assign Costner to find out who killed her.

Obviously, all the evidence points to
the hapless Farrell. We get to sit through
the nexthour and a half of the movie and
watch Costner turn in a fine performance

of a man who knows he's not guilty but
will be wrongly proven so. Not only will
he have killed the girl he supposedly
loved, but he will also be falsely labeled
a Russian. mole. _
During this 90 minutes, we are forced
to watch Will Patton overact his charac-
ter with such a passion that you not only
hate the ruthless bastard, but you wish .
that he wasn't in nearly every scene.-
The movie, however, isn't all that bad.
If you totally ignore the first and last five

~ minutes of the film (the first five of which i

set up a very stupid, trick ending that has
no bearing on the film whatsoever) and
allow yourself to believe that Costner and

Young really do fall in love, you'll find -

a good movie in the middle. It does have
quite a few faults, but none major enough
to ruin the film. All in all, go to the movie
late, leave early and forget about the girl.

Pitt Program Council announces film schedule

    

By Ike Shibley

Staff Writer

Poor college students some-
times find it difficult to find qual-
ity entertainment at a reasonable
price. Oakland is bustling with
bars, theaters and restaurants, but
most cost a pretty penny. This
creates a problem when you
want to take a date someplace
other than the Towers lobby. The
solution: a $1 movie at the David
Lawrence Auditorium sponsored
by.the Pitt Program Council.

I must be too old for playing

this record at any volume. The
same must be true for probably

all but a few teen—age males hold-
ing on to dreams of getting
through puberty unscathed.

The name of the album is Loud

phrase to promote the disc. The
direction here is crystal clear —
they are going nowhere.

”Down ’n Dirty”and ”When the
Sun Goes Down.”

If they do not signal the quality
contained therein, nothing can.

To write down the lyrics for a
few, songs would be a waste of
time — mine and yours. Suffice
it to say that the words for the
songs are no more creative than
the titles.

Just for fun — I lead a dull life
— I counted the number of times
the band repeated the word
”down” in the song ”Down ’n
Dirty.” I got 50 as a rough esti-
mate. In the song ”She Never‘
Looked That Good For Me,”
which is, incidentally, the best
track on the album, they repeat
the title no less than I5 times.

overabundance of cliches, but

Since January 1987, AT&T’s

The Decade

223 Atwood St.
(687-ROLL)

Yes, this is the place where the
Police, U2, Cyndi Lauper, Stevie
Ray Vaughan, Double Trouble
and even the Boss played when
they were up-and-coming.

- This, the self-styled ”Home of
Rock ’n{ Roll,” is a great place to
go for blues/rock, a real bar at-
mosphere and a chance to be
close to where the music is com-
ing from. The regular line-up in-

, cludes Red, Hot & Blue, Room to

Move and 8th Street Rox, all
bands with solid resumes. There's
usually a band every night of the
week.

The Upstage
3609 Forbes Ave.
(687-9777)

Do you like to dress up and
play pan—sexual scene-maker in
these decadent times? Then the
Upstage Lounge is for you. The
beautiful and not-so—beautiful
people hang out here. There is
the rare night when a band plays
here, but there is a steady stream
of progressive dance music dur-
ing the night as well as the week-
ly WXXP-sponsored Dare—to—Be-
Different Dance Contest. Come
dressed-to-kill or likewise.

Graffiti
4615 Baum Blvd.
(682-4270)

The best place to _see budding
40 acts, Graffiti has the ideal at-
mosphere for a rock club. With
a seating capacity well under a
thousand, the music is always
loud and up-close.

Graffiti attracts a lot of alterna-
tive music artists, such as Fuzz-
box, The Replacements, Gene
Loves Jezebel, Pseudo Echo,
Concrete Blonde and local bands
such as The Affordable Floors and
Hector in Paris.

But if you're under 21, be

‘warned. They hold a lot of

over-21 shows, and if you lack
ID, it's virtually impossible to get
in without a written note from
your mother and proof from both
the FBI and CIA. They occasion-
ally offer a|I—ages shows.

If you make it past the hench— I

men guarding the door, there's a
bar area separate from the main-
stage. Here they offer munchies
such as a cheese and veggie

board, hot wings and Cajun sea

bites.

The concerts usually aren't that
cheap, but because of the stage
and seating arrangement, it's the

best place to see live music in .

Dear Students:

Welcome to the University
of Pittsburgh and to what I
hope is the beginning of a life-
long adventure in learning. I
am adding my greetings to
those of the Interfraternity
Council because a fraternity
may very well become a part
of the experience you are en-
tering.

In man ways, fraternity life
at the University of Pittsburgh
represents the best of both

worlds — the identity and.
close companionship of a

small group and the cos-
mopolitan cultural advantages
and resources of a ~major
metropolitanregion and insti-
tution. Because ‘fraternity live-
ing produces permanent
allegiances and provides an en-
vironment conducive_to good

« citizenship and high achieve-
ment, it fosters the develop-

well—adjusted
In such an at-
mosphere, leadership ﬂourish-
es. The correlation between
fraternity backgrounds and-
leadership is well established.
At the Uni.versity of Pitts-
burgh, fraternities also are the
initiators of many charitable

ment of

projects, and the sponsors of
many social and recreational
activities. They encourage
scholarship, and healthy com-
petition, and their members
learn to value fellowship and
‘sharing.

I advise you to examine
what these chapters might be
able to offer you and what they
might contribute to your total
academic and extra—curricular
experience at the University.

Sincerely ,

Wesley W. Posvar
President.

WHY JOIN A ERATERNITT?  

Pitt.’s -fraternities can offer more to the new student than ‘
most other campus organization. Each of the 20 national .

fraternities on campus has its ownlunique charateristics and
personalities which means that there is a fraternity for

everyone. These fraternities have many things to offer that

will not only enhance your college life, but be valuable
throughout your entire life. I

ACADEMIC ,

The reasons one comes to school in the first place is for .

an education. Pitt Geeks have a higher overall grade poiiint
average than that of the campus average. In each frateni-
ty, you will ﬁnd students with many different majors, stu-
dents that can help you with your classes and problems.

tion for participation. In a fraternity, you have
many chances to make new friends through par-

ties, mixers, and involvement in such things as

Greek Week and Homecoming. There are
Greeks involved in every aspect of the univer-
sity such as Student Government,Resident As-
sistants, and numerous honoraries. Knowing
these people as friends makes college live a lit-
tle easier.

  ATHLETICS

Fraternities can compete in a variety of sports
through the University’s Intramural Department.

Fraternities compete in softball, soccer, volley- g
ball, football, basketball, swimming, wrestl_ing, ‘ .

and track, and ultimately for -the ‘All Sports

. Trophy awarded at the end of the year to the

chapter most successful in all of these sports.
Sports play a big part inithe Greek system, by
participating, win or lose, we always have fun.

- BRQTHERHOOD  

A fraternity gives the new student a starting-

point. Byibecoming a member of a fraternity,

I ' you have a base from which to grow at Pitt. It

is often hard for a new student to establish
friendships at a large university. Being Greek
provides you with a special group of friends.

It is from this group that one grows academi-

cally and socially. These men won’t be just your
friends, but your brothers for life. Pitt Greeks
don’t limit themselves to their fraternities, but
use them as foundations for participation in
many other facets of university life.

FRATERNITY RUSH REGISTRATION

Fraternity Rush takes place from August — Sep-
tember 22. During this period fraternities will
host a variety of rush functions so that they can
get to know you and so that you will have the
opportunity to learn about their fraternities.

University policy prohibits the use of alcohol.

at any rush function so please keep this in mind
when attending any activities.

Fraternity rush registration is free of charge - I

and will be taken at all IFC events. You may

also register in the IFC Office, 628 William Pitt .

Union, or at various sites on campus.

Lovely Debra Winger and sexy
Theresa Russel star in the story of
a woman who marries men then
kills them for their money.
Winger is on the trail of the mur-
derous Russel, and when she

so consider yourself forewarned.
Interesting film.

I Tough Guys

Nov. 6 & 7

Kirk Douglas and Burt Lan-
caster star in this comedy about
two ex-cons released from prison

after 30 years to find that the out-

actors are wonderful, and the
movie is a barrel of fun. "

I Platoon

Nov. 13 & T4 ‘

Oliver Stone's Academy Award
winning movie is incredible. It is
the most realistic depiction of
Vietnam to hit the silver screen.
All three stars — Charlie Sheen,
Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe
— are great. Do not expect to
walk away from this movie
unmoved.

I Star Trek IV; The Voyage Home

NOV. 20 & 21

Leonard Nimoy directed this
fourth in the Star Trek series. He
has packed more all-out fun'into’
this one than the other three com-
bined. The entire cast is in top

I Children of a Lesser Cod

Dec. 4 & 5

Marlee Matlin copped an
Oscar for her performance as a
deaf-mute. William Hurt-turned

timental and enjoyable. A great
film to take a date to.

I Lethal Weapon

Dec. 11 & 12

Mel Gibson is considered to be
a lethal weapon because of his
explosive personality as an Viet-
nam vet working for the police
department. Danny Glover is his
partner who _”is too old for this

I Sid and Nancy

Sept. 19 & 20

Alex Cox, who gave the world
Repo Man, directed this film that

Technical foul       
Academics haunt Goodson, while twoothers fold‘!

By John Enright

Editor. in Chief _, _ . - . -

Pitt basketball players Marlon
Ferguson and Chris Gatling have
both left school because of aca-
demic difficulties and starting
point guard Mike Goodson’s
eligibility status is still in ques-
tion, according to Pitt basketball
coach,Paul Evans.

Evans said yesterday that
Goodson still has to clear up an
incomplete grade to retain his
athletic eligibility.

John Bolvin, dean of the Col-
lege of General Studies and Pitt's
NCAA faculty representative, said
he wasn't sure of Goodson’s aca-
demic situation but would know
more within the next week.

Goodson, a 6-foot-3 junior
from Elizabeth, N.J., started every
game at point guard for Pitt last
year and averaged 8 points and
4.8 assists per game.

As for Ferguson, a 6—foot—8‘/2
forward from Center High School
in Monaca, his playing career at
Pitt has come to an end.

Said‘ Evans, ”[Ferguson’s] not
a§a‘d¢lm,i.ca|.ly .e.|i.gib|e... His basket-
ball career is finished here."

Ferguson said he is pretty close
to graduating but has not enrolled
in classes for the fall semester
which begins today.

"I have to talk to [Pitt Athletic .

Director] Dr. [Ed] Bozik. To be
honest, I haven't thought a lot
about what I'm going to do. I'm
trying to enjoy the rest of the‘
summer, and I haven't thought
much about Pitt at all,” said

’ Ferguson.

”Unless [Ferguson's] done any-
thing [academically] over the
summer, he's not eligible this
year,” said Bolvin.

Ferguson said that he was en-
rolled for classes for the summer
term but that he dropped out for
personal reasons. ‘

Ironically, Ferguson's career
with the Panthers was relatively
silent compared to the publicity
surrounding Pitt's recruitment of

him in high school.

When Ferguson was a senior in

to a party at a friend's house by
Pitt assistant coach Seth Green-
berg. This was a violation of
NCAA rules. Pitt was reprimand-

- ed by the NCAA, and Greenberg

Ferguson played sparingly his

medical reasons which were
never disclosed.

Panthers ready fortoni g

By Christopher Sepesy

The first game. Tonight.

And, as it has been for the past
several seasons, the Pitt Panthers
have, paradoxically, things both
to lose and to gain in their con-
test against Brigham Young
University. '

But more togain.

”We have to put all of our dis-
tractions behind us and go out
and win that football game,” said
Pitt head football coach Mike
Gottfried last week. ’4’We have a_
lot of work to do still ahead of us,
but |.’m confident that the boys
can ‘do it. We’v”e‘"'ha_d setback's,W
but we're coming out of camp

 

____..-._. _ ,.

”We don't need luck to win
this game.‘We should be able to
win it plain and simple with our
own strengths.”

Well, Gottfried, on his past
track record alone, should know
the certainty in what he is saying.
However, this certainty has al-

ready been given its test of fire,
and already this year the skeptics’

are starting to emerge.

But, by his .own convictions,
Gottfried negates them all. And
he is hoping to use Brigham
Young as a springboard to furthur
successes. » A '

aside, his 1987 team has the

potential to pull it out.

LaVell Edwards, head coach at
BYU, claims that his team's kick-
ing game is its strongest asset. If
this happens to be true, the Pan-
ther defense should have no
problem.

”We have been training as
hard as we possibly can,” said
freshman tackle Marc Spindler
who, along with classmate tight
end Eric Seaman, will see the

This weakened line Spindler
speaks of is comprised of many
injured returners. They do have

the experience which perhaps‘
the Panthers are lacking some-

what but, without full strength,

Edwards feels more than a little '

reserve about sending them in.

”We have a strong offensive
line if we could ever get them off
of the injury lists,” said Edwards-.
”We've got three starters [junior

Teryl Austin, Pitt's secondary
player suspended in June for hav-
ing dealings with agent Norby
Walters, has been given partial
eligibility by the NCAA Eligibili-
ty Committee for his final season
of play under certain specified
conditions.

Austin had been declared in-

eligible because he went against
NCAA regulations and entered
into a contract with World Sports
and Entertainment, the firm of
Walters and Lloyd Bloom. He
received a loan for the amount of
$2,500 from that firm.

His eligibility will be restored
after he sits out the first two

. games the Panthers play and also

after he repays the ‘loan. to
Walters and Bloom and IS void of

any contractual obligations to
them.

The committee must have
documented proof of this before
they will give authorization to
Pitt.

The committee was apprecia-
tive of Austin's cooperation in the
matter and hopes his candor con-
cerning it will continue with
other players facing the same sit-
uation. Although they are not ex-

posed, the Committee reported
they know other players around
the country are in contractual
agreements with agents.

”By taking this action, we hope
we can encourage student-
athletes who have signed with
agents to come fon/vard, with the
knowlege that the Eligibility
Committee will consider restor-
ing a substantial part of their re-
maining eligibility,” said Lew

Louis Riddick has stated in the
past that he would like to be a
Rhodes Scholar, but this fall the
majority of his education will
come on the football field.

A 6—foot-3, 205—pound free
safety from Pennridge High
School in Quakertown, Pa., Rid-
dick i-s one of Pitt's top freshmen
football recruits.

In fact, he could very well be
the most talented athlete out of
the 25 scholarship freshmen Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried and his staff
recruited last winter.

Riddick, who is a cousin of
former Pitt and Green Bay Pack-
ers’ star Tim Lewis, was named
first team All-America by Parade,
Ba/Iy, Super Prep and USA
Today. He was first team All—State
and a member of the Big 33 All-
Star team. ‘ A

The numbers Riddick posted
for Pennridge in 1986 are as fol-
lows: 127 tackles (68 solo), five

interceptions (two for touch-
. downs), three fumble‘ recoveries, '

960- yards rushing and 19

touchdowns. .

He also accumulated some
impressive numbers in the class-
room. Riddick had over a 3.5
grade. point average (out of a pos-
sible 4.0) and scored 1,100 on
the SAT.

In fact, Riddick is a finalist for
a President's Scholarship, a merit-
based award which takes into
consideration past achievement
and potential for academic
exceHencen

”It’s something that would be
great to win, and it would. be an
honor,” Riddick said of the
scholarship.

”Louis is very strong [academ-
icalIy],” said Gottfried. ”When
we recruited him, one of his goals
was to be a Rhodes Scholar. I
think to have somebody with that
kind of billing coming in is very
impressive.” »

One of the strengths of this
year's Pitt team isthe defensive
backfield, where three of four
starters return from last year's
squad.

Seniors Gary Richard and

Quintin Jones will start at the cor-
nerback spots, while another
senior, Billy Owens, returns to his
strong safety position.

‘ ty, which is Riddick's position.

_ Fifth—year senior Teryl Austin
played free safety last year, but he
was ruled ineligible to play this
season by the NCAA because he
accepted money from a profes-
sional sports agent.

Gottfried said junior Troy
Washington, sophomore Marcus
Washington (no relation) and
Riddick will battle for the free
safety position.

Dan Crossman, a transfer from
Kansas, may also get a look at
free safety, according to
Gottfried.

Riddick should have no trouble

seeing playing time this season, ,

but he's taking a wait—and—see

attitude. ’’I’m not going to say

since.Tery|’s ineligible that I'm
going to have any better of a
chance [of playing] than I would
have before. I'm just going to
work as hard as I can,” he said.

Riddick knows that ultimately
his fate is in Gottfried’s hands. ”I
want to contribute where I can.
Like everybody says, playing time

is up to the coach. Hopefully, I'll

get some playing time,” added
Riddick.

"Louis is the kind of athlete that
we're hoping will help us right
away but also, Troy and Marcus
are pretty good players," said
Gottfried, who didn't dismiss the
notion that losing Austin is a
setback.

”It’s going-to hurt us losing
Teryl in that position because
you're losing a fifth-year guy," he

;:~‘.x --f.'.w'*‘-?.'t=é“v-r‘

said..

However, due to the return of 

Riddick’s hopes take him on many Rhodes

 

Richard, Jones and Owens, the 

Panthers’ defensive backfield
should be strong.

And Riddick, who I many
believe may have been the top

football prospect in the state last I 

year, should add to that strength.

But for how, Riddick takes the 

casual approach. “My ultimate I
goal is to make the traveling»

squad/’~ he said. »

Quite modest for a player. who "

By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

With the addition of two new
walk-on atheletes apiece, the Pitt
men's and women’s tennis teams
should be ready to face tough
opponents this fall.

The Panthers will be adding
Mark Sonders of West.Chester,

‘ Pa., and Omarishanla Garret of

Philadelphia totheir roster this

fall. Sarah Glick of Carlisle, Pa.,
and Gwen Mcintyre of Bradford
Woods, Pa., will join the ranks of
the Lady Panthers.

The men's team, which tied for
third place in the Big East Cham-
pionships last year and had a win-
ning season with an 11-8 record,
suffers the loss of three top play-
ers this season.

Monteleone will be missing from
the lineup this fall. Pitt men's ten-
nis coach George Diffenbach
doesn't feel the missing seniors
will weaken the team all that
much.

’’I feel we will be weakened at
the most by one position,” said
Diffenbach. ”The three returning
players should be much im-

proved. The three returning play-

ers are real workers and play with

 

Sept.

a good additude. They should
come in this season stronger than
ever.

" ”Because we have our top
three players returning our top
three positions will be stonger
this season, and [we] will have to
concentrate on strengthening
those bottom three positions.
Hopefully, Sonders and Garrett

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 2, I987

Life in a brother’sshadow: Nate Heyward

By Eric Reuscher
For The Pitt News

The Pitt football team has a
strong possibility of being one of
the only schools in the country
that starts two brothers in the
same backfield. With the emer-
gence of Nate Heyward as a ser-
ies contender for the fullback

,.position, he will join brother

Craig in the backfield, who estab-
lished himself as the No. I
tailback.

Nate came to Pitt in 1983 by
way of Passaic High School in
Passaic, N.J. While there, Nate
was the lead blocker for Craig,
and they formed one of the best
backfield combinations in the
school's history.

When he first came to Pitt,
Nate was tried as a defensive
back. Although he was talented
enough to play the position, the
secondary was already composed
of seasoned veterans. That's
when former head coach Foge
Fazio moved Heyward to the spe-
'cial teams. For the past three
years, he has earned the reputa-
tion of being a hitter for special-
teams play.

He is such a great tackler that
he once gave Pitt great Bill Fralic
a concussion during fall camp.

”When I first came to Pitt, peo-
ple thought I was too small to
play,” said Heyward. ”When I
got here, I showed them thatl

;, could play by being a hitter.”

“‘“‘E3urinrg' his“junior year, 'Hey-- ‘_f
'wa‘r'd*saw"Iimitéd"a'cti<5rﬁﬁ'§'fé'w‘ “‘

games last season at the fullback

_ spot. With the departure of Tom

Brown to the NFL, Heyward is
one of the more experienced
returners at that position.

His career might -seem to be
headed in the right direction, but
he almost called it quits before
last year started.

”I really had to sit down and
look at all my options,” Heyward
said. ”I didn't know if I wanted
to go through an entire coaching
staff change. With the old staff, I
was told I would play more, and

—I never did. Yet on the other

hand, I thought I would be given
a new chance to prove myself to

' the new coaches.”

And prove himself he did. This
past spring, Heyward received
the Ed Conway Award for the
most improved defensive back.
Heading into the fall camp, he is
listed as the No. I fullback and,
if his play continues to improve,
he should be the starter against
Brigham Young on Sept. 2.

But a problem that Heyward
might have run into was trying to
live up to the reputation his youn-
ger brother Craig has set. The
older Heyward feels this is not a
problem because both he and
Craig realize that they are not the
same type of ballplayers.

”Sure, I guess people are going
to compare us, and they're going
to see that Craig is a better run-
ner than me,” said Heyward.
”But they also have to remember
the size difference and that we
play different positions. I've
always been a blocker, and Craig
has always been a runner. People
know the type of player I am and

the type of player Craig is. I've
never really, focused on who is
better because that can cause
problems between people, espe-
cially if you're brothers.”

Heyward is the type of person
that never lets anything bother
him. He is always smiling and
tries to motivate others whenever
they are not having a great game.
His attitude is if you make a mis-
take, shake it off andcome back
and correct the mistake later.
Heyward feels that if a player

" dwells on mistake for too long,

he'll be of no use to the team for
the rest of the game.

Supposedly, the people back in
New Jersey are already talking
about the Heyward reunion at
Pitt. They remember what it was
like when Nate would open up
holes, and Craig would charge
right through.

If Nate emerges from camp as

-the starter, people across the

country are going to be treated to
what the Jersey people knew a
long time ago.

Nate Heyward (top) said he
is more than proud to be
related to his brother, Craig
Heyward (bottom), and does
not feel one bit envious of
Craig's successes.

Craig said earlier this year
that he is more than happy
that his brother has been able
to play and hopes he gets to

see more playing time this“

season.
Each will be individual
forces in the backfield. Com-
bined, it is still too premature
to think what they may do.

.The Pitt women's volleyball

of five starters and the addition of
four promising freshmen recruits

Pitt women's head volleyball

things will add up for the Pan-

”Sue Hoover, who graduated
last spring, is the only starter we
will be without this season," said
Collier. ”We will be adding four

new freshmen, who I think have
excellent chances of starting for
us this season. They are definitely
going to cause some waves.
’’In my equation, minus one
and plus four definitely adds up,”
continued Collier. ”With five
starters and the entire bench
back, it would seem as if the line-
up was pretty well set. However,
I think these freshmen recruits
will challenge the veteran play-

ers and make things interesting.”
One of those challenging situ-
ations Coach Collier talked about
will probably take place in a bat-
tle between the new and the old
for the starting setting position.
The two players who will come
head-to-head vying for the start-
ing position will be senior Louise

Shelley Seanor rounds out the
Panthers freshmen recruiting
class.

Seanor is a defensive player
who was first team All-WPIAL
while attending Hempfield High
School. The Panthers plan to use
her as a leftside hitter.

”We rated Shelly as the No. 1

player in" western Pennsylvania i

this year. She is the only girl in
the state we recruited so, obvi-
ously, we're very happy to have
her with us,” said Collier.

Another aspect Collier feels
will affect the team in a positive’
manner is theitough schedule
they will play this season.

The Lady Panthers will start off I

their home schedule with the
nationally ranked Georgia team
on Monday, Sept; 14. Collier
feels this match could set the tone
for the whole season.

”Georgia is a key match for us
because if we upset them early in
the season, it will help our
national ranking and ,_ possibly
give us a better NCAA‘ draw,”
said Collier.

Meanwhile Gatling, a 6-foot-8
forward from..Elizabeth, N.J., who
sat out last year because of Propo-
sition 48, has transferred to Old
Dominion‘ University in Norfolk,
Va.

According to Evans, Gatling,
who attended the same high
school as Goodson, would have

been academically ineligible to '

play for Pitt this season.

Every Division I school has its
own set of academic guidelines,
though, so Gatling was still able
to transfer to Old Dominion.

Gatling’s enrolled in classes for
the fall semester and will sit out
the year under NCAA guidelines,
according to Old Dominion
basketball coach Tom Young.

Young added that if Gatling’s
grades meet Old Dominion’s
standards, he will be eligible to
play in the 1988-89 season and
have three years of eligibility re-
maining. ‘

”Three weeks ago Gatling’s
coach [Evans] called us and said
he was looking to transfer,” said
Young. ”When I was [head
coach] at Rutgers and Chris was
a sophomore in high school, he
was at our camp. We recruited
Chris heavily in high school.”

Gatling, a very thin lefthander
was considered -a project ‘when
he was recruited by Evans in
April, 1986.

Evans, who was hired as Pitt's
coach in March of 1986, had a
late start in recruiting, and
Gatling was the first high school
player he ever signed to play for
the Panthers. '

athlete. It's time for him to
emerge as a really great quarter-
back like the others.

”What we're really counting
on is that he will be able to com-
plete enough passes to the
receivers. They're one of our
good points. And I can't rule out
the running backs.

”We hope to use our passing
game a lot. We didn't really use
it much last year because we real-
ly weren't very good at it. But
we've worked really hard on it
and should be able to give it a
really good shot,” he said.

Gottfried said he wants to use
the defense in this game as much
as possible, but gives accolades
to BYU's defense as well.

”They’re not just a passing
team,” he said. ”They’ve got a lot
of beef and strength in their
defensive line, as well as their
offense. Their running backs are
young, but good.”

Gottfried himself is entering
this game with a young but some-

what experienced team. But he
trusts in those who know his
plays and strategies. He said his.
key concerns are with the first-
timers. "
’’I just don't know what they'll
do going out onto a field with a
crowd of 65,000 booing them.”
Gottfried said he expects to use
those starters who proved the
most to him in camp. And he has
acquired confidence in his
back—ups. ‘
