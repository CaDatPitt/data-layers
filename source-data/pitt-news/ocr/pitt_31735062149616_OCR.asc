Igor Mourns As Stalwarts
Heed Graduation Summons

Pundit Holstein Writes
Farewell To Arms
For Seniors,

By Ron, Igor, A. C. E.
Although there are no accompany-
ing catches in the throat or smarting

around the eyes, this is somewhat of
a tough job. It’s been a permanent
task, duty, assignment for four years
now, and it’s always been an easy on
up to now. ~

Four years ago come today, approx-
imately, the writer, one of the low-
lier freshmen on the editorial staff of
The Pitt .NeWs,
hearing tell of a
ten-inch gap in the
front page of the
' ﬁnal issue, sat
down and wrote
glowingly of the
_ ten or so members
of the staff who
_ were graduating,
I going out of the
3 life of The Pitt
‘ News. Since then
it’s been taken as
a matter of course
that the tradition
be continued. Now,
no longer a mem-
ber of the staff for
the past few weeks, the old job comes
up again and we go to bat.

When the processions for the Col-
lege, School of Education, and School
of Business Administration ﬁle past
Chancellor Bowman on Wednesday,
June 10, 14 seniors who have done
yeoman service on the rag take a big
chunk out of News personnel and ma-
terially lessen threats of horseplay in
Room 709, Cathedral.

First, there is Editor Charles A.
Ruch. Spending his ﬁrst two years

 

Cr/4/2/.56’ /1o‘/.375/N

_concentrating on the Panther and

writing skits for Cap and Gown while
taking part in them, Ruch became the
editor of the Panther in his junior
year. Which is something seldom
done around here. At the same time
he was the sports editor of The News
and took charge of the sports section
in the Owl. All this made Mr. Rucli
quite a busy man in his junior year.
Taking the Senior Spoon award to
step ahead of his junior classmates,
Ruch topped his year off when he was
appointed editor of this year’s News,
succeeding Tibby. It‘s unknown as to
Charlie’s plans after graduation, but
it is rumored he will stick close to the
Pittsburgh district. Mt. Lebanon sent
him here. ’

Tumpson, business manager, has
held that job for two years now, and
as advertising manager his sopho-
more year was largely responsible for
a sizeable proﬁt, thank you. (You're
welcome, Ted). When he goes out
in June he.goes out in a big W9-Y--9-9

Executive Group
Plans To Set Up

New Committees

 

Following approval by the entire
Student Faculty Assembly Tuesday
evening, the executive committee of
SFA acted Wednesday to set up work-
ing and planning committees for the
coming year. This action, taken four
months in advance of last year’s
group, should, according to William
Schenck, BA37, chairman, start activ-
ity of the assembly as soon as school
resumes in September.

Fourteen of the projects which the
executive committee accepted were
passed upon by SFA after discussion
in its special meeting on Tuesday. The
executive committee was then em-
powered to appoint chairmen and
committee members for all these
groups.

In addition to the committees sug-
gested by the executive body, certain
other suggestions were brought up
from the ﬂoor of the assembly. Wil-
liam Blair, C37, moved that a com-
mittee be appointed to investigate the
possibility of establishing a Phi Beta
Kappa chapter on the University cam-
pus. SFA was in agreement, but it
was decided to defer any such action
until the beginning of next semester.

A complete list of committee ap-
pointments with their duties may be
found on page ﬁve.

Among The -Faculty -
' Autobiography

HAROLD W. SCHOENBERGER was born in Pennsyl-
vania and received some rudiments of instruction at
Muhlenberg College, where he distinguished himself for
the number of chapel cuts he accumulated. Later the
University of Pennsylvania gave him a Master's degree,
mirabile dictu. In 1923 the same school, for reasons
not yet explained, offered him, faute de mieux, a Harri-
son Fellowship in English; and because of an error In
the Registrar’s oﬂice, he received a Ph.D. in 1924. The
error was not detected until a-fter his graduation, and to
avoid a national scandal the university refused to re-
scind its action. It is understood that the Registrar
was later ﬁred. ’

Before coming to Pitt, Professor Schoenberger had
imposed himself upon the faculties of Penn State, Ore-
gon State, and the University of Wisconsin, where he
sedulously pursued split inﬁnitives, comma splices, aind
dangling participles.

He has no hobbies. He does not collect stamps or
ﬁrst editions or half-burnt cigarettes. As a matter of
fact, he will walk a mile _to avoid a man with a hobby.
He has not read a detective story that post-dates The
Murders in the Rue Morgue. ’He cannot recall a- favor-
ite book or author, for he boasts a catholicity of taste,
If he has any vices,
he refuses to comment upon them, but he does confess
to smoking entirely too many cigarettes in a successful
attempt to retain his boyish ﬁgure, though his greying
temples bestray him in spite of his best efforts.

Twelve years ago he came to Pitt, where he ﬁnds a
student body as delightfully fresh as any in the land.

His publications fortunately are few. Besides some
book reviews, there is an undistinguished thesis called
American Adaptations of French Plays and seven ar-

ticles on obscure ﬁgures in the Dictionary of American

Biography.

Ferguson Revises Book

Dr. John M. Ferguson, professor of economics, has just
received, his complimentary copy, of the ﬁrst volume of
a new type economics textbook which the publishers of
the book sent to him in recognition of nearly a year’s
work spent in revising and making detailed» criticisms of
the contents, ' -

The book, the third edition of “Economic Principles
and Problems” edited by Walter E. Spahr, professor of
economics and chairman of the department in the School
of Commerce, Accounts and Finance, of New York Uni-
versity, is, according to Dr. Ferguson, a, novel experi-
ment in the writing of economic texts.

The contents are the work of several authors outstand-
ing in the ﬁeld of economics and specialists for the most
part i-n the particular ﬁeld about which they wrote.

The purpose of the book‘ as described in the preface
is “to provide a standard textbook in economics which
would include in each chapter the most authoritative
data and principles.”

To accomplish this aim the editor thought it advisa-
ble to solicitthe aid of all the teachers in the subject
who used the former editions of the text in their courses.
Consequently, the 26 authors living in all sections of the
United States and one author from England were each
asked to write chapters of the book dealing with their
particularﬁeld of economics.

Dr. Ferguson’s part in the publication was to revise
the text after it had been written.

Recognition of this service ‘was made in the preface
to the ﬁrst volume by the editor, Walter E. Spahr, who
said, “Our debt to Professor John M. Ferguson of the
University of Pittsburgh can hardly be paid. He pre-
pared voluminous suggestions based upon his teaching
experience with the second edition. In addition, he read
all the chapters of the present edition, made detailed
suggestions, and continued his ‘watchful and construc-
tive assistance even through most of the proof.”

' Dr. Ferguson is the author of two other books: “The
German, Railway System” _ and “State Regulations of
The ﬁrst of these two books is written in
German. . .

In addition to Dr. Ferguson, another member of the
University staff participated in the writing of the book.

Dr. C. R. Daugherty, professor of economics, who has

been absent from the University this year, but who is
expected to return next fall, wrote two chapters in the
text.

Dr. Daugherty wrote the chapter on “Labor” in the
ﬁrst volume and the chapter on “Wages” in the second
volume.

‘Asylum’ Recalled In Thesis
By Milton Lehman, Jr.

From the pen of an alumna of 1919 comes an unusual
study of the extinct ‘town of Asylum, Pennsylvania. Lu-
cille L. Zoller, who graduated from the school of edu-
cation in 1919 with ‘a Bachelor of Artsdegree, has re-
cently completed the thesis for her degree of Master of
Arts. Majoring in French, Mrs. Zoller lived in the
neighborhood of the‘now legendary Asylum for several
years and became interested in the legend connected with
that early French colony. The thesis, the result of re-
search and compilation of scattered fact and myth, is
named. “The French Settlement at Asylum, Pennsylva-
n1a.”

ment of modern languages.

The colony Was founded by a group of French immi-
grants on a large tract of _land on the northern branch
of the Susquehanna purchased from Robert Morris. The
republican Viscount de Noailles and the royalist Omer
Talon made the contract with Morris, and construction
was begun in the fall of 1793. '- ”

_With, the increase of colonists, the town grew. In
1795 it consisted of about thirty log houses, ‘a church,
taverns, stores and all other necessary establishments.
But the colonial boom fell short and, as Mrs. Zoller
explains, “. . the expected source of capital of the
founders having failed, the ownership of the company
passed from their hands to those of other proprietors.
Although an ‘Asylum Colony’ was in existence until
18-13, the colony itself was of much shorter duration.”
The colony was doomed. Napoleon’s invitation to the
French to return to France, together with adverse condi-
tions in the colony, and the new land to the West served
to empty" Asylum in short order. Only three families
remained.

The legend that the colony was planned as a refuge
for the deposed Marie Antoinette is capably treated.
With a series of ten blows, Mrs. Zoller dismisses the
myth of Asylum. But the myth is interesting, even if
it contains no truth. Concluding her abstract, the au-
thor says: “Although factually untenable, the legend
has contributed greatly to the romantic charm of the
locality and has done much to preserve the remembrance
of the short sojourn of the French refugees in northern
Pennsylvania.” -

Mrs. Zoller has taken graduate courses in French at
the University as required for the Master's degree. She
teaches French at the extension center of Penn State
at Du Bois, Pa. '

New Accounting Book

Students taking Accounting 1, -2 next fall at the Uni-
versity will use as their text “Accounting Funda-
mentals,” which has just been completed by Co-authors
Robert D. Ayars, professor in accounting, and George
A. MacFar1and, professor in accounting at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania.

This book, containing 30 chapters, was written with
the purpose of anticipating the student diﬁiculties and
attempting to eliminate them. A large portion of the
book deﬁnes basic principles, a contrast to the regular
accounting procedure. “It sets the stage before it puts
on the show,” according to reports. ,

(The scene is the oﬂice of W. Don Harri-
son, director of University athletics. Mr. Har-
rison is seated at his desk, wearing a blue
gown with a gold. cap, alternately toying
with the tassel and adjusting his collar,
which is just a bit 1.-lg-ht. Outside the oﬂice.
ﬁdgeting nervously in their caps and gowns,
the various coaches of Pitt athletic teams al-
ternately stand. and sit. It is commencement
day, but for the sake of keeping the story
moving, we will have Mr. Harrison distribute
blueprints rather than‘~ diplomas.‘ As the
scene opens, "Dr. John B. Sutherland marches
into the director's office.) ’

Mr. Harrison: Dr. Sutherland, I've,
been looking over your blueprint. It’s
not at all bad. This course in Or-
ganization and Teaching of Fordham
didn't come out so well . .

Dr. Sutherland: They just wouldn't
learn, sir... There was a guy named
Maniaci in the class and he was
worse than his name.‘ He bothered
me.

Mr. Harrison: He bothered a lot of
people. Now about this course in Car-
negie Technology. I understand that
was all a mistake.

Dr. Sutherland: Just so you under-

stand. _ .
, Mr. Harrison: This four-credit
course in Annihilating the Army must
have been right up your alley. I see
you pulled down an A plus,

Dr. Sutherland: I always was good
at handling mules.

Mr. Harrison: Now there’s a little
matter of Neurosis of Notre Dame to
be considered. (At this point foot-
steps are heard approaching the door.
Harrison stealthily goes to the door,
opens it quickly, and ﬁve coaches tum-
ble intothe room. They ﬁle out in
confusion. One admits candidly,:“We.
just -wanted to hear this.” Theothers
mumble, .“We lost a car-check.”)

Dr. Sutherland: You see, Mr. Harri-
son, it was this way. There was a
guy named Peters in the class. He
got on my nerves. He was always
kicking about something. Once he
kicked the football right over the goal
posts and . . . .

Mr. Harrison: (brushing away a
tear) Yes, yes, I‘k'now. Just forget
about it. By the way, what are your
plans for next year?

_, -Dr. Sutherland: Knock hell out of
Notre Dame.

‘Mr. Harrison: Fine, Goodbye’, Jock.

Dr. Sutherland: So long, Don. (Dr.
Sutherland exits, bumping into Dr. H.
C. Carlson who comes in wearing a
cap and gown, and a big smile and
carrying a pint of ice cream. Through"
out the scene, the good doctor prettily
rnoves—a- spoon, engraved “Faculty
Club,” between the carton. and his
mouth.) '

Mr. Harrison: I have your blueprint
here, Dr. Carlson. (Indeed he does. He
opens it and the thing unfolds down
over the desk, under a chair, and the
‘end of it rolls alonglthe ﬂoor -until
it hits a wastebasket.) Twenty-six
courses!- What ‘a schedule. How did
you ever do it? (Carlson points to
the ice cream.) ‘

Dr. Carlson: Well, twenty-six, if you.
omit the Akron. and Wilmerding
YMCA affairs. .

Mr.— Harrison: We might as well.
How about this Carnegie Technology
1?

Dr. Carlson: I refer you to Carnegie

Technology 2.

Mr. Harrison: That ~leads us to Car- -

negie Technology 3.

Dr. Carlson: It was a frame-up, I
tell you. I never should have had to
take the course. It‘ was that Sleepy
Glenn person who wanted to make an
impression at West Virginia who
caused it all. Imag-ine, just by one
point, too. —

Mr. Harrison: How about Private
Life of the Duke of Bluff.-

Dr. Carlson: Well, the ﬁrst semester
it was a little guy nam.ed Malackney
who got in my hair.

Mr. Harrison: Who what? (He looks
at the good doctor, who by this time
should have taken oﬁ his mortar
board anyway.) '

Dr. Canlson: I said he got in .my
hair, little Malackney.

Mr. Harrison: Gosh, I never knew
he was that little. I mean to get in
your . . .

Dr. Carlson: (testily) Anyway, I
have more than Malackney has. And
don't forget that second semester.

Mr, Harrison: Indeed I won’t. I un-
derstand you had a hot Noon lunch-
eon that day and it helped you a lot.
By the way, how about Neurosis of
Notre Dame?

Dr. Carlson: It certainly isa lovely
day.

Mr. Harrison: It certainly is. What
are you going to do next year?

Dr. Carlson: Knock helll Out of No-
tre Dame. (It’s about time we get the
good doctor off the stage. He’s ready
for another pint of ice cream. A small-
er ﬁgure enters the office.)

Mr. Olson: (by way of introduc-
tion) You spell it with an T“o.”

Mr. Harrison: Mr. Olson, of-course
you understand that we have quite a
few incomplete grades for you.

Mr. Olson: I realize that, but if I
can come through with this thesis I'm
preparing “Getting a Pitt Track Man
in the Olympics,” I think I'll be all
right. , I

Mr. Harrison: Indeed you will. Now
your record here shows three A
grades in three courses. ,

Mr. Ollsonz That’s fine, thank you.
And don't forget those term papers on
the Penn Relays. ‘

Mr. Harrison: Now. about this
Neurosis of Notre Dame. A lot of
the boys seem to be having trouble
with -that this year. «

Mr. Olson: I think the Iris_h are
mad at us because we had that‘ ﬂood
on St. Patrick's Day.

Mr. Harrison: Oh, yes. And what
are your plans for next year?

Mr. Olson: Knock hell out of Notre
Dame. (He goes out whistling for a
good hammer thrower.)

Mr. Harrison: (To a fellow who en-
ters somewhat timidly, sans cap and
gown, and carrying a freshman pla-
que.) Yes, sir, what can I do for you?

Mr. Kowallis (for indeed it is he):
I"m the freshman basketball coach.

He was chairman of the Spring Fes-
tival Dance last year, which also
made lots of money, thank you.

Helen Rose Gibson lines up her “lit-
tle rascals” in the "women's staff and
says goodbye today too. She ﬁnishes
three years service on the paper, and
I said and mean service. She stop-
ped over here four years ago as editor
of the Allegheny High paper and said
to Pitt, “What are you going to do
about it?” but not in so many words.

A Busy “Little Rascal”

It seems plenty was done— in the
shape of bestowing honors and such,
and now she goes out with honors and
with plenty of ﬁrst class themes and
term papers. Back, in the Survey
course four years; ago -she was the
one whose themes were read in class,
and as women’s editor of The News
she has been theone who has done
a tremendous amount of unselfish
work over and above the normal du-
ties of her position. It’s_ doubtful if

who knows her and doesn't like her.

I On the managing editor’s desk has
sat Israel L. Goldberg, when he wasn't

down in Texas or Alabama or some-
where debating. They said back in
his freshman year that he had some-
thing on the ball, and proceeded to
give him a major part in a Pitt Play-
ers show and tell him he’d go far.
He's been debating manager for two
years, president of Pi Tau Phi, hon-
orary scholastic fraternity this year,

and a key man (in the wider sense)

on The News ever since there has
been a News. (See above). Made
SFA twice. It’s rumored that he won’t
graduate with highest honors because
he got a B somewhere on his card.

  Intramural Athletic Season

Feely’s Records Show 259 Different Players Competing
In 12 Activities Offered On Year’s Program

By Leonard S. Levison
“Intramural athletics are here to stay,” said Martin J. Feely as
he leaned back in the swivel chair of his Trees Gymnasium ofﬁce and
glanced at the ﬁgures, which, just compiled, added up to a sum total
of another success for the University ’s second year of Intramural

athletics.
An entry and participation tabula-

tion revealed the fact that 259 differ-
ent players took advantage of the 12
activities offered by the Intramural
program. This, although it is approx-
imately the same as last year, does
indicate a ﬁrm foundation for an In
tramural structure that should con-

tinue to rise in the years to come.

In addition to the fraternity compe-
tition, leagues were formed to include
such groups as the Engineers, the
Medical School, the Dental School,
the College, and the Independents.
Cross country, touch football, volley-_
ball, basketball, boxing, wrestling,
table tennis, bowling, track, and
mushball were the various phases of
competitive athleti-c endeavor that
were made available to every student
whether he had a high school repu-
tation or not.

Cross country, inaugurated this year
in a downpour of rain, brought out 25
participants for a tour around the
campus by foot. Jimmy Filson, a
PiKA pledge, outdistanced the ﬁeld
and won the ﬁrst cross-country medal.

Touch football, ranking next in cal-
endar order, was third in student ap-
peal. The feature tournament was
the elimination affair of the 13 frater-
nities. Kappa Sigma started its cup
winning campaign by conquering
Delta Tau Delta, the defending cham-
pions, 6-0, in the ﬁnal game. A for-
ward pass, Groat to Mahoney, scored.

the winning touchdown. »

Volleyball, making its debut onthe"
Intramural schedule, followed. As an
experiment, it was only open to the
13 fraternities. In an enthusiastic
tourney, Delta Tau Delta defeated‘
Phi Delta Theta in the championship
match. '

Basketball and mushball drew the
biggest entry lists. An involved play-
off process made the Sophties the In-
tramural champions and the Kappa
Sigs the fraternity champions. _

Table tennis, making big strides in
popularity, drew close to 100 entries
in its individual tourney. Irwin Solow
won the title for the second succes-
sive year by defeating William Bro.-
sius, runner-up for the second straight
time. Delta Tau. Delta won the fra-
ternity championship with Sigma
Alpha Mu as runner-up. .

Bowling, tennis, boxing‘, and wrest
ling were conducted in the tourna-
ment manner. A track meet was held
during Spring Festival Week.

WAA Cabinet Members
Plan Seasonal Play Day

Next year WAA will participate in
a. series of seasonal intra-city play
days, according to plans outlined at
the WAA cabinet meeting on Monday.

In addition to making plans for this
new program, Betty Cox, Ed37, sports
chairman of WAA, announced the
managers of the seasonal sports in
which WAA members participate.
These managers are: Sara Brunson,
C38, hockey; Dorothy Holbrook, Ed37,
basketball; Frances Grimes, BA37;
tennis; Eleanor Fedigan, Ed37, swim-
ming; Thelma Bock, BA37, golf;
Kathryn Markley, Ed37, archery;
Dolores Hoffman, Ed37, mushball.

Dice Writes Feature
On University Library

Alumni Review To Feature Library
In June Issue, Next Week

 

Featuring an article on the new
library by J. Howard Dice, University
librarian, the June issue of the Alum-
ni Review, the official publication of
the General Alumni Association, will
appear next week.

The contents of the magazine will
deal almost exclusively with the va-
rious rooms of the recently opened
library. On the cover will be a pic-
ture of one of the alcoyes of the Dar-
lington Memorial Room, and through-
out the rest of the magazine pages
will be photographs of the new Cathe-
dral quarters and, by way of contrast,
some illustrations showing the old
State Hall library.

The other regular features will be
included, among them Robert X. Gra-
ham’s campus news jottings, Frank
Carver’s sports review, alumni per-

sonals, and news of constituent organ-

izations.

Vanquish State Team

Yep! the Rover Boys from the other
side of the railroad tracks have done
it again. The Pitt varsity tennis team
under the captainship of Joe Madden,
whipped out a 6-3 victory Saturday
over the Penn State Lions ‘and made
them wish they had State at home.
We have but one sad case to report:
Ralph Bald was defeated for the ﬁrst
time in his initial varsity season.

The boys played Navy at Annapolis
Wednesday, George Washington Uni-
versity on Thursday, and will try Ito
sizzle a few over the net at George-
town University, Washington, D, C.,
today. If these matches are won, the
team will have set a new record by
winning more than 17 matches in a
row.

Tstone has a good bounce to it’.
N 0 one ever searched for a way to
make gold quite as thoroughly as
men of science in this generation
sought for a new source of rubber.

For a time it looked as though
goldenrod might turn the trick .  .
but the actual solution came from
research chemistry. . . and from gas.

Acetylene gas, the stuff used
years ago for auto headlights, and
still used today on thousands of
farms, was thestarting point.

.Father N ieuwland of N otre Dame
University found a way of making
acetylene gas molecules join to-
gether to produce a liquid. DuPont
. chemists saw in this a possibility.
Here, at last, might be the key to
a satisfactory man-made rubber.

ing investigation—success! This ~ -
product of chemical research, now
sold by Du Pont under the trade-
mark “DuPrene,” has all the char-
acteristics of natural rubber, but is
better for certain purposes.
“DuPrene” is superior to Na-
ture’s product in resisting heat,
oils, chemicals, sunlight, and de-
terioration from age. One place
where thisis demonstrated is in use
on machinery—as in the case of
gaskets. For many such uses
“DuPrene” has replaced natural
rubber despite its present higher cost. *
Thus the chemist comes to the
rescue. Not only is it possible for ‘ "
America to be independent of for- ’ A
eign rubber supplies—but (more
important now) American industry

'Fhe:Pitt News  . . i :
Around and aroundcshe goes, ».
And where she stops ~ “ . _ = ,
Only the Circulation Staff knows.

This was the theme song of the.

circulation staﬁ before I took time off
from my duties as sports reporter-at-
large, tennis team press agent, polit-
ical science student, and stray-dog-
bringer-homer to delve into the ﬁles
of The News’ circulation stair out of
curiosity as to where this gem of
newspaperdom landed. -.

Naturally, there was much wailing
and gnashing of teeth upon the part
of the aforesaid staff as I ransacked
their dusty desks in pursuit of the
mailing list. And when I asked them
had they an extra pencil I could bor-
row, they seized their hair, their hats,
departed with undue haste . . . and
where they went. nobody knows.

But now I know where The News
goes. Its circulati-on ranges from
North Dithridge Street to Sydney,

Australia; and from New York City

to K,okomo,_Indiana. Just as Honi
Soit, publication of the University of

Sydney, Australia, ﬁnds its way into i

the Cathedrallof Learning, so does
The News wander into Sydney’s
scholarly halls. And probably as we
wonder a bit_ about advertisements
having a prominent place on the
front page of Honi Soit, they indubit-
ably wonder why The News conﬁnes
their ads to the inside and ‘the W0-
man’s page.
Old English Custom

It is the custom of English.jo_ur-
nalism to place some advertisements"
on the front page, and no doubt the
Australian portion of the British Em-
pire follows suit. Well-established
London newspapers, conservative in
every other way, appear with liver
pill advertisements above streamer
headlines, or sometimes they vary
the edition with corn syrup “that
made the quintuplets what they are
today —— bouncing, healthy, chubby
tots.”‘ Higginbotham’s Cheese, homo-
geneized a.nd pasteurized, spreads
like butter, makes healthy and happy
children, and is made from milk of
contented bovines.

There is nothing like having liver
pill-advertisements in the day's news
along with League of Nation squab-
bles, Nazi terrorism, or the diplo-
matic strokes of Anthony Eden.

, There originates a story such as only

the inimitable .“Saki” could do jus-
tice to, or perhaps P. G. Wodehouse.

Well, there was a query around

 

They stimulate digestion in a pleasant, natural way
. . . increase alkalinity »

The human digestion is a marvelous
but delicate mechanism. It responds
adversely to the hurry and mental
strain so common to our busy lives
today. It is deﬁnitely encouraged by
smoking Camels. Scientiﬁc studies show
how Camels aid digestion. Sensitive

 

here a few, weeks ago as to why
Honi Soit’s’ gossip "column designated
elderly women as “old girls” without
the quotation marks».
loquial English expression, and often
applies to the alumnae of educa-
tional institutions. Canadian news-
papers print bits in their society col-
umns similar to this: “Barnstaple
Old Girls will meet at tea today at
the home of Mrs. J. Throckmorton
Beauwhistle, 1000 York Drive.” Just
for fun, imagine University of Pitts-
burgh alumnae calling themselves
the “WUP Old Girls” or “Pitt Old
Girls”. and not minding it in the
least! ‘
.Goes To Kokomo

VVhen we saw the word “Kokomo”
on the mailing list, the connotation
was that of cherry blossoms, jinrick-
shas, and bright-eyed Japanese ﬂit-
ting around as The Pitt News arrived
in the daily mail. But then, we read
on, and it turned out to be Kokomo,
Indiana, where ostensibly respectable

citizens do not ride in “rickshas” and:

sniff cherry blossoms in the spring,
but probably bounce about in rat-
tling ﬂi-vvers, charging delivery
