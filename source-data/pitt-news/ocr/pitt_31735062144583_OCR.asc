ﬁlling, to capacity the ballroom of
the William Penn" Hotcl,;,and at. the
tables alumnae of the university and
their friends, all dressed up in their
holiday best and all acquginted for
the most part with one another! The
picture, framed in the cordial and
friendly‘ spirit of ‘such ‘a. group, is

from the letters and comments that.
have come to the committee since
the party. '

, Last Wednesday afternoon was:
the time-—a..fact to make one sor-
row, considering that many alumnae
who do not teach have‘ difficult get-
ting away from their offices uring
the week; to make one glad, con-
sidering the many, many girls home

to attend a university party. But
in the future when the New Year’s
eve_ celebration no longer interferes
the date Will a ain be the Satur-
day between C ristmas and New
Year’s..

“Peg” McClanahan, '19, who, with
her infectious smile, is the best lit-
tle “receiver” known, was at the
door to “hello” people as they ar-
rived and help them get acquainted
and ﬁnd their tables. Her aidcs were:
Katherine McNamara, '23, Jeanne
Muter, ’26, Helen Hunt, ’17, Helen
Donaldson, ’16, Helen Lloyd, '26,
Dorothy. Stewart Nicklas, '23, Syl-
via Hannan, ’27, Helena Flinn
Gregg, ’20, Nell McKenry, ’23, Mary
Bigham, ’24, Margaret Thompson,
'26 and Helen Schmucker Fry, ’21.

“Mid” Guiney Lewis, '25, had the
tables supplied with cards and very
attractivé. score pads furnished by
a local ﬂower dealer. The table
prizes, wrapped in Christmas style,
added an ' unexpected ‘touch at the
end of the afternoon. They were

pretty and useful.

The Candy committee, under the
direction of"Dora Ilitzfeldt Elsholf,
’17', was a§ prominent during the
afternoon as usual. Their efforts
were rewarded first by contributions
of unexcelled home~ma.de candy and
later by the knowled e that they
had cleared eighty do Iars for the
afternoon. They still insist on ex-
pressing a secret hope that that
amount may rise still higher. Mrs.
J. K. Miller, wife of Professor Mil-
ler of the English Faculty of the
University, contributed her usual
large box of candied .orange,and
grape fruit peel. Her substantial
interest in the party is much ap-
preciated. ,

to Have Weekly ‘Eats’

The varsity basketball team,
which made history. by winning
from Michigan, Northwestern‘, Chi-
cago and Iowa on their trip into
Western Conference, territory, eamo
home with ﬁne reports of the treat-
m_e,n-t they received at the hands of
Pitt alumni in the various places
they played. This was especially.
true in Chicago, "where Frank N.
Adams. Eng. ’06, and George A.
Spaldzng, P-bar. "03, led the welcom-
mg committee. The attendance of
alumni ‘at the game ‘in Northwest-
ern, whlch Pitt won after ‘a thrilling
ﬁnish, included about 30 or 40
rooters and they certainly made
‘themselves heard.

Frank Adams, commenting on the
games around Chicago had this to
say in a_. letter to the Secretary, De-
cember 21: “Pitt has received great
advertisement in this section as a
result of their Wonderful basketball
team. It is the best showing we
have ever had in the Chicago papers.
The Chicago alumni are certainly
proud of their team and hope every-
on_e realized accomplislments on the
trlp. The trip has had a great ef-
fect on the alumni, and I believe
will result in our getting a Chicago
club started in earnest. Perry Ad-
dlemaI1..Col. '19-, is in Chicago now,
and has offered to do the clerical
work. We will get busy right alter
theﬁrst of the year.” 5

Adams was in Pittsburgh for the
Christmas season and the Secretary
enjoyed having lunch with him.
Frank is “all bet up” over the has-
ketball tri and says it has —stirred
‘up the ent usiasm‘ of Pittites in the
Chicago district as nothing else
could so. The Chicago Club will
inaugurate :lunche,ous ri~ht after the
Christmas holidays. Watch the
“Weekly” for announcements of
dates‘ and place. r

this score was nothing more than a
repetition of the famous Notre
Dame-S. California play, With.Stan-
ford making an incomplete pass.

The terriﬁc Southern California
heat can be partly blamed for the
Pitt team not scoring an easy.‘ win
over the Stanfordites, while the long
tedious train‘ ride and the lapse ‘and
letdown that came after the Penn
State game can also be blamed; if
blame or ali-bis are looked for. With-'
out a doubt the heat told’ on the
men. , Starting out of Pittsburgh the
day’ after Christmas the team was
forced to experienceiive or six dif-
ferent brands of weather, strange
sleeping quarters and all sorts‘ of
foreign conditi-ons, new to. the Gold
and Blue footballers. Arriving in
California, the team foundthat they
were greatly criticized and open to
such by both the public and the
newspapers. While it is not known
if this’had,.an effect on the team, it
is believed that they were somewhat
bothered, according to some of the

papermen. .
l Underneath a blazing -sun the
lPanthers took their place on the
ﬁeld and then began the game that

_ in time spelled ,de:’c'eat by the nar-.

row margin of one point. " Pitt re-
ceived the kiclcoﬁ’ and startedan of-
fense up the ﬁeld, ﬁnally -being

on for two complete quarters the
Pittsburgh. team, although often re-
freshened with new substitutions,
was subjected. to a vicious assault
thattook a great part of the starch
out of theimen. Late in the ﬁrst
quarter the Sutherland men began

roses." The heat began to tell its
tale.. The charges of the"‘1inemen
were beginning." to slow up; and: the
men, trying to getja bit of coplness,
tookto rolling; themselves over the
ground when the occasion permitted.
It was obvious then that thisteam
would go the way‘ of the other good
eastern teams, namely Pennsylvania-
and that great collection of Eastern
