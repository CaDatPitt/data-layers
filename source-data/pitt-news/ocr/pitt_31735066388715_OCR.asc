Creeks play pool and
ping-pong for charity

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

The ”First Annual Greek Fund
Raiser” was held this weekend
through a combined effort of the
lnterfraternity Council and the
Panhellenic Association.

The fund-raiser consisted of a
24-hour period of pool and ping
pong games in the William Pitt
Union recreation center from 2
p.m. Saturday to 2 p.m. Sunday.
All money raised will be con-
tributed to the Western Pennsyl-
vania School for the Blind.

Chuck Farinella, IFC president
and coordinator of the event, said
that his goals for this fund-raiser
were ”interacting the Greeks
more, raising money for charity
and trying to get more publicity

Feminists

By Jill Lawrence
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Feminists
who worked for years to win pas-
sage of a broad civil rights bill are
trying to decide if they still want
it now that the Senate has added
an anti-abortion amendment like-
Iy to stick.

Legal experts say the amend-
ment, sponsored by Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., has far—reaching

tween $3,000 and $4,000
through sponsors’ contributions,”
said Farinella. ”So far, I'm happy
with what I see.”

As an added incentive tothis
program, local merchants have
donated 130 prizes which will go
to those Greeks who have put
forth the effort to make the fund-
raiser successful.

”We really want to reward the
people who put the most time
and effort in,” said Farinella.
”This is not so much of an obli-
gation as Greek Week is, and we
really appreciate those who take
the time out to come down.”

”The Pitt Greeks are showing
themselves on campus through
their phiIanthropies,” said Lisa
Krisay, Panhellenic treasurer and
registration clerk. ”This is good
interaction for Pitt Greeks and

The developers of a com-
plex of townhouses and con-
dominiums now being
constructed in Oakland hope
to be able to provide afforda-
ble housing in the city.

The Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation
joined with Ryan Homes to
build the 64—unit complex
called Holmes Place, located
on the site of the former Hol-
mes Elementary School. The
Pittsburgh school board con-
tributed the land to the Oak-

land Planning and
Development Corp. for de-
velopment.

In so doing, they are hoping
for an overall revitalization of
the community and a strength-

ening of the neighborhood in
addition to making homes
available to lower-income fa-
milies. They also wanted the
property returned to tax role.

Richard St. John, the associ-
ate director of Oakland Plan-
ning, said, ”Our role was
twofold. We brought special
funding to the project to make
it available, and we don't have
the same profit-minded role as
opposed to a private de-
veIoper.”

Urban development has
generally been difficult be-
cause it involves rezoning and
rebuilding in existing neigh-
borhoods. Also, city sites are
smaller, and greater care
needs to be taken to make sure
the new homes fit into the ex-
isting communities.

implications that could outweigh
the protections women would
gain elsewhere in the Civil Rights
Restoration Act the Senate passed
75-14 last Thursday.

’’I think it has the potential for
really allowing institutions to dis-
criminate against women and
girls” for having had an abortion,
said Judith Lichtman, executive
director of the Women's Legal
Defense Fund. ”There is no way
to describe the Danforth amend-

ment but as a devastating defeat.”
The 20-odd women's groups in
the I85-member Leadership Con-
ference on Civil Rights, the driv-
ing force behind the restoration
act, are trying to settle on how to
handle the bill when it comes up
later this year in the House.
Among the things they must
consider is the importance of the
bill to minorities, the elderly and
the disabled, who also would
benefit from its wide protections

against discrimination by federal
aid recipients.

Also, the anti-abortion amend-
ment won so many additional
votes for the civil rights bill that
its inclusion virtually guarantees
the Senate could override a threa-
tened presidential veto. A similar
effect is likely in the House,
which historically is less sym-
pathetic to abortion rights than
the Senate.

Ch ristic
Institute
describes
lawsuit

By Lisa Molinaro
Staff Writer

Eve Bertram of the Christic In-
stitute last night presented an up-
date on the Christic lnstitite’s
lawsuit involving the Iran-Contra
affair. The Christic Institute, an in-
terfaith group designated to up-
hold public policy has recently
gained prominence in the news
with this lawsuit.

The lawsuit involves a terrorist
bombing which occurred three

years ago in Nicaragua. The .

group believes the bombing was
planned by CIA members and
military officials. The institute be-
lieves the money for this bomb-
ing came from funds" raised by
drug sales assisted by govern-
ment officials. I

Their secrecy is in-

— Eve Bertram

Bertram began by discussing
the institute. She said the Chris-
tic Institute selects cases to help
’’establish social justice.” ”What
happens in the courtroom doesn't
matter as much alone as how it
affects the public,” she said. The
institute was founded in 1980 by
investigators who won the Karen
Silkwood case. She then went on
to describe update the current
Contra Project.

”We are gathering evidence to
support our allegations,” she
said. The bulk of the group's evi-
dence consists of witness testimo-
ny. This testimony includes
contra-pilot Michael ToIiver’s
claims that
weapons to Costa Rica and
returned to the U.S. with mariju-
ana.

She then spoke of why this sit-
uation is critical to us. She felt the
main problem is the fact that a
”shadow government”’ has
formed in the U.S. that is led by
CIA officials. ”Their secrecy is in-
compatabe with democracy."

Drugs, a problem with today's
society are also a factor if
governement official are involved
in their shipping. Two objectives
of the ”shadow government ”in-
clude ”redefining national secu-
rity," and deciding ”what are the
permissable means to meet these
ends and who'll carry them out.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February l, l988

Pa. legislators to take up key issues this week p

HARRISBURG —- The House
appears ready for floor action this
week in the special session on lo-
cal tax reform, while senators are
poised to consider limits on
phone porn and siting a low—level
radioactive waste dump.

House Democrats hope action
on tax—reform legislation will give
a shot in the arm to the issue that
has stagnated in the special ses-
sion that Gov. Robert P. Casey
convened in November.

The bills make up most of a
proposal outlined by House
Majority Leader James Manderi-
no, D-Westmoreland, and may
face extended debate on the
floor.

Last week, Republicans agreed
to help move the bills out of the
Appropriations Committee,
although they didn't have time to
fully study the proposals. The
GOP leaders said they would
review the bills and address any
of their concerns on the floor.

The legislation would make
various changes intended to shift
some of the tax burden off of
property owners, and authorize a

constitutional amendment allow-
ing higher real estate taxes on
businesses than on homeowners.

Even if the measures clear the
House, the legislation faces an
uncertain future in the Senate.

In the Senate, an aide to
Republican majority leaders said
it appears the low—level radioac-
tive waste issue will come up for
vote. The House approved the
bill just last week.

The bill is one of the initial
steps in development of a dump
that would accept such low—level
radioactive wastes as resins and
clothes from the commonwealth,
West Virginia, Maryland and
Delaware.

The Senate also appears ready
to consider legislation designed
to protect Pennsylvania corpora-
tions from hostile takeovers.

Meanwhile, legislation to regu—
late so-called dial-a-porn services
also may come up for a vote in
the Senate. The bill would re-
quire a customer of the service to
get a code or other personal iden-
tification number in order to gain
access to the sexually explicit

phone recordings.

Under the bill, there would
have to be a specific warning that
there will be a charge for the ser-
vice and a designation that it in-
cludes explicit material. It would
also ban minors from gaining ac-
cess to phone calls.

4 more lawyers may
get indicted in case

PHlLADELPHlA -- A star wit-
ness in the 21-month—old court
corruption investigation that
resulted in a judge's conviction
last week may help officials indict
as many as four more lawyers, a
prosecutor said.

Assistant District Attorney
Pamela L. Donleavy said new in-
formation from Conrad Cheeks,
former aide to convicted Com-
mon Pleas Municipal CourtJudge
Kenneth Harris, could lead to
new indictments in the spring.

Harris, 67, convicted Tuesday
in federal court of extortion and
racketeering, has been notified by
federal authorities that he is the
target of a related investigation,
his attorney, Samuel C. Stretton,
said Friday.

Donleavy said information
from Cheeks would help form the
basis for charges against several
lawyers whom Cheeks said gave
him money to deliver to Harris in
return for favorable rulings.

"There were a number of law-
yers he [Cheeks] picked up
money from that will be indict-
ed,” Donleavy said.

She estimated three or four
lawyers would be charged ”in
the first round, probably this
spring,” and said some of the
tapes made during five months’
bugging of Harris’ robing room
would corroborate Cheeks’
account.

While declining to identify the
lawyers by name, Donleavy
pointed out Cheeks had testified,
during Harris’ trial, of bringing
hundreds of dollars in cash to
Harris from three criminal

HBO therapy effective in relieving extreme pain

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Staff Writer

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a
medical treatment in which a pa-
tient breathes pure oxygen in ord-
er to help treat nonhealing
wounds, burns, carbon monox-
ide poisoning, ulcers, poor circu-
lation and other injuries that
require oxygen to heal.

Dr. Sai S. Ramasastry, M.D.,
medical director of the Depart-
ment of Hyperbaric Medicine at
Presbyterian—University Hospital,
said that many of the patients
treated with HBO therapy ”have
found a tremendous amount of
relief from pain.”

The patient is placed inside of
either a monoplace or a mul-
tiplace pressurized chamber. A
monoplace chamber can treat
only one patient at a time while
a multiplace chamber is able to
reach a higher atmospheric pres-

sure and can treat up to six pa-
tients at once.

The multiplace chamber also
has room for an attending physi-
cian and a nurse to aid trauma-
tized patients. The nurse and
doctor can enter the chamber
with patients for only one treat-
ment per day.

The Presbyterian-University
Hospital owns a monoplace
chamber and has purchased a
multiplace chamber that is cur-
rently in storage. ”When con-
struction is completed, hopefully
we will be able to set it up here,”
said Dr. Ramasastry.

Until the multiplace chamber is
set up at Presby in the spring of
1988, local patients that are trau-
matized or require an atmospher-
ic pressure greater than 3
atmospheres are being treated in
a multiplace chamber in
Philadelphia.

The first hyperbaric oxygen

chamber in North America
designed for therapeutic use was
built in 1860.

During the 19305, the U.S.
Navy used HBO therapy to treat
divers with decompression
sickness.

Unsubstantiated claims during
the 19505 and 19605 caused
many misconceptions to arise
about HBO therapy. ”Hyperbar—
ic oxygen therapy isnot treatment
for senility, aging, preventing
wrinkles, rejuvenation or han-
govers,” said Dr. Ramasastry,
”and the National Enquirer story
about Michael Jackson should
not be bought. it is amazing what
people will believe.”

Some of the possible side ef-
fects of HBO therapy include
oxygen seizures, convulsions,
confinement anxiety and a con-
dition called ear squeeze which
is an inability of patients to
decompress the middle ear.

Dr. Ramasastry said that these
side effects are generally ”rare
and easily treatable.”

Research is being conducted
using various atoscopic devices
to test the middle ear in an effort
to predict which patients might
develope ear squeeze. If this
research is successful, tubes can
be placed in the ears of these pa-
tients before therapy to prevent
ear squeeze.

Patients undergoing HBO ther-
apy are treated 96 minutes per
day, five days a week. Patients
receive an average of 20 to 30
treatments. Eighty percent are out
patients which eliminates the ex.-
pense of a hospital stay.

The physiological principle be-
hind HBO therapy is that breath-
ing pure oxygen increases the
partial pressure of oxygen in cir-
culating plasma by TO to 15 times
which sustains life in the absence
of hemoglobin, inhibits bacterial

growth and induces the develop-
ment of new capillaries in injured
body tissues.

Research is currently being
conducted concerning other pos-
sible uses of HBO therapy.

Directors of the Department of
Hyperbaric Medicine at Pres-
byterian include Medical Direc-
tor Sai S. Ramasastry, M.D.,
Assistant Medical Director Larry
Weis, M.D., and Administative
Director Clark H. Long.

Staff members also include
nurses and chamber operators
trained specifically to assist pa-
tients undergoing HBO
treatment.

”l firmly believe that HBO ther-
apy should be used in a similar
fashion to prophylactic antibiot-
ics,” said Dr. Ramasastry. ”You
should start treatment when you
sense trouble, not wait for com-
plications to reach irreversible
stages.”

New study to treat stroke victims with surgery

By Keri D. Smith

Staff Writer

Physicians at the University of
Pittsburgh are involved in the Na-
tional Cooperative Trial to test the
effectiveness of carotid endar-
terectomy surgery for the treat-
ment of stroke victims.

Oscar Reinmuth, principal
coordinator of the Pittsburgh
Component of the North Ameri-
can Stroke Study, said the study
is being done to ”determine the
effect of one particular treatment
[carotid endarterectomy

surgery]."

According to Reinmuth, all
subjects eligible for the study
must be patients who have had
a stroke or stroke—related sym-
ptom and recovered.

”A common cause of stroke,”
said Reinmuth, ”is narrowing of
the carotid artery  with either
acclusion [hardening of the ar-
tery] or clots that break off and go
to the brain.

”Treatment is to remove the
narrow spot and restore the ves-
sel to its normal diameter,” Rein-
muth said.

Reinmuth went on to say that
the carotoid endarterectomy
operation has never really been
tested.

”Once a person's had a stroke
and is crippled for life, it's a ter-
rible thing,” said Dr. Howard Yo-
nas, associate professor of
neurosurgery. ”lt’s common in
North Americans for this artery
[carotid artery] to narrow. It
throws clots up into the brain.
Millions of people have this
problem.”

Subjects admitted to the study
will either be placed in a control

group or in an experimental
group. The control group are
those patients who will not be
operated on but will receive med-
ical treatment. The experimental
group are those patients that will
receive carotid endarterectomies.

The North American Stroke
Study is made possible by a grant
from the National institute of
Health. The study has been divid-
ed into a surgical segment and a
medical, or non—surgical
segment.

‘These patients who would be
entered into the study are those

who have had a TIA, in which
symptoms are impaired speech or
temporary numbness of an arm or
leg, and also those who have had
an actual stroke,” said Dr. Tho-
mas Julian, assistant professor in
surgery.

Dr. Julian added that the nar-
rowing of the carotid artery does
not happen in old age but starts
early in life. He speculates that
North Americans, as opposed to
other populations, have more
cases of carotid endarterec-tomies
since our population smokes

Continued from page 1

”The House has a better record

will vote to limit reproductive
rights, and they don't get the con-
nection,” said Pat Reuss, a lob-
byist for the Women's Equity
Action League and head of the
leadership conference's women's
task force.

She added, ”My personal
temptation is to pass [the bill]
swiftly and speedily, and fight the
reproductive fight on another day
in another administration.”

Others indicated there will be
intensive efforts to kill the Dan-
forth amendment and conceiva-
bly even an attempt to strip Title
IX, the law barring sex discrimi-
nation in education, from the
civil rights bill.

”The Civil Rights Restoration
Act represents some enormous,
critical gains and affirmation of
women's rights,” said Marcia
Greenberger, managing attorney
at the National Women's Law
Center. ”But it also has a very
major flaw. It's going to be up to
us to work to remedy that flaw.”

The restoration act is intended
to reverse the effect of a 1984
Supreme Court ruling that Title IX
applied only to specific programs
or activities receiving federal aid
rather than to entire institutions.
The bill restores the institution-
wide coverage supporters say
was intended by Congress.

The Danforth amendment says
nothing in the civil rights bill or
Title IX requires institutions to
provide or pay for abortions.

as also saying in an interview that
it was ”just nastiness” to say a
bribe was behind Israel's decision
not to attack a proposed Iraqi
pipeline.

Meese, under investigation for
corrupt business practices, has
been linked to the affair by a
1985 memo from his longstand-

ing friend, E. Robert Wallach.

In the memo to Meese, Wal-
lach, an American Jewish attor-
ney, cited a plan to pay off a
top—ranking Israeli official in
return for a guarantee that Israel
would not bomb the pipeline.

The Los Angeles Times identi-
fied the official as Peres, Israel's
prime minister at the time.

Wallach was acting as a go-
between for Iraq, which sought
the pipeline as an alternative ex-
port route because the Persian
Gulf was blocked by Iran.

a U.S. military source said.

”The helicopter reported that
the ship was smoking and aban-
doned. No crew was located or
observed,” said the source,
speaking on condition of
anonymity. The ship was identi-
fied as the I5,24I—ton Mare, a
Greek—owned cargo vessel.

Iraq claimed its fighter-bombers
carried out two attacks off the Ira-
nian coast during a nine-hour
period Sunday. Shipping execu-
tives said one of their targets ap-
peared to have been the Mare.

Damage to the ship appeared
characteristic to that inflicted by
air—|aunched Exocet missiles used
by Iraqi planes in raids against Ira-
nian shipping, one gulf-based
shipping executive said.

Some shipping officials specu-
lated that the attack may have
been a mistake. Others suggest-
ed the Iraqis knew the Mare was
bound for the Iranian port of
Bushehr and thus considered it a
legitimate target.

Dole, Simon get nod

from big Iowa paper

DES MOINES, Iowa —— Iowa's
largest-circulating daily
newspaper on Sunday endorsed
Republican Bob Dole and
Democrat Paul Simon in the

state’s Feb. 8 presidential
caucuses.

The Des Moines Register, in
departing from a tradition of not
endorsing candidates before the
caucuses, rejected Vice President
George Bush for supporting the
Iran—Contra deal and said
Democrats would not have to
apologize if any of their party's
candidates won, except Gary
Hart.

The newspaper gave its ap-
proval to the two senators from
nearby Midwestern states in side-
by—side editorials and explained
its decision to make the unusual
endorsements in a separate
column by editor James P.
Gannon.

No other large Iowa daily so far
has endorsed candidates in the
precinct presidential selection
process, which provides the first
voter test for six Republican and
seven Democratic candidates.

The Register, which has read-
ers across the state, where candi-

dates have focused much of their I

early campaign, said that while it
disagreed with Senate Republi-
can leader Dole of Kansas on a
;number of issues, ”it is usually
possible to tell where he is com-
ing from. And it is from a good
place — traditional Midwestern
Republicanism.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February I, I988

Man fears his impotence may destroy his marriage

Q: lam 59, and my wife is 56.
Recently, something bad has
happened, all my fault, but I
don't know what to do. Sudden-
ly, I became impotent. I have
several erections a night but can't
maintain them long enough to
have intercourse. My wife
doesn't deserve this, and I would
not blame her if she were to
leave me, but it would kill me.

A: Hold it! You are going too
fast. Your wife is not going to
leave you. I don't care whether
you have been married 40 years
or one —~ she is not going to up
and leave a man who shows as
much love and concern as you
do. A woman does not throw
away a good man unless there is
something much more basically
wrong than a temporary loss of
lovemaking ability.

You are right to be concerned,
and to seek help. What you need

is to stand apart and see your sit-
uation as one that happens in
most marriages at some time. I
get questions like yours again and
again.

DR. RUTH
WESTHEIMER

The man's ability to take part in
sex is a delicate thing. A man sud-
denly thinks he is ”impotent” —
a word that we sex therapists
don’t use much because it isn't
much help. A guy who thinks he
is impotent usually loses his abil-
ity to make love. When I get a
question like yours, my first
thought is that his problem is one
of personality, not a physical
problem.

When a man brings this
problem to my office, sometimes
I send him to a urologist. The

problem may be medical, to be
dealt with by a change in medi-
cation or something like that.
Often the urologist says there is
no physical problem, but some-
thing has gone wrong with the
man’s se|f—confidence.

The human male has a brain
and a soul and is not purely a
physical creature. This should
make him proud, not ashamed,
but often even a very intellectual
man has to be convinced that he
needs some help with sex ——
either from the woman who

shares sex with him or from as

professional helper. Help is avail-
able. You can go to the nearest
big hospital or call up and ask for
a reputable sex therapist. Or you
can first try something at home.
This can work and is worth
trying.

You can talk to your wife and
say that it has panicked you that

you might fail her as a lover. Tell
her that in every marriage, there
comes a time when the man
”can’t make it.” And once the
man begins to worry about that,
he will not be able to make it
again. He has to get back on the
track, and to do that he has to
stop worrying.

To do this, you must take the
pressure out of lovemaking.
When the worried lover no
longer has to have an erection,
when he and his woman can give
pleasure without having inter-
course, he can lose his anxiety
about ”performing.” And his abil-
ity to perform comes back.

I suggest that you give each
other all the tender words and
caresses you can without trying
to ”have sex.” This will bring on
many an erection and will arouse
her —- but let those aroused
desires subside. Just enjoy the

preliminaries. They are pleasant 9

in themselves, yet forgotten by
many in their anxiety to
”perform.”

Sometimes, you can give or-
gasms to your wife with whatever
techniques you use other than in-
tercourse. If you become very
aroused, let it pass. But go back,
on the next occasion, to non-
orgasmic intimacy. Through this
technique you may very well get
into such a relaxed state of mind
that you can, on some occasion,
maintain an erection and once
again have intercourse.

The fact that you do have erec-
tions regularly is a good sign that
your problem is worry, and that
the answer is in learning how to
put worry about performance out
of your mind.

Q: My wife came into the room
where I was pleasuring myself
and that was embarrassing be-
cause I was embarrassed, if you
get me. I mean, we both know
there is nothing wrong with it.

Anyway, the worst thing about
it is that now she thinks I don't
love her, or that she isn't enough
for me, or something dumb like
that. Nothing I say seems to help.

A: Please tell her that lots of
married people do pleasure
themselves even though they are
having terrific sex. It doesn't
mean they are not in love, and it
doesn't mean they aren't getting
enough sex. In fact, it can be a
sign of being happy and aroused
by thoughts of what has been go-
ing on with a spouse. It should
cause concern only if the partner
is avoiding shared sex.

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Call it
the frustration factor.

The six senators who have
announced their retirement
before the election this year
have raised an intriguing ques-
tion: is the Senate less fun than
it used to be?

Republican Sens. Arlen
Specter and John Heinz of
Pennsylvania said in inter-
views this week that they
recognize the pitfalls that can

. sour someone on the Senate
experience. But both said that
for them, the accomplish-
ments outweighed the disap-
pointments.

Senate may be losing appeal

’’I think the Senate is very
different than it was 10 or 15
years ago,” said Heinz, 49.
”The country is very different,
and the problems, well, there
are more of them, and some of
them are even more in-
tractable.

”My own experience has
been that in spite of the frus-
tration of dealing with those
problems, in spite of the grow-
ing attention you have to give
to all the details in a cam-
paign, what is rewarding in the
Senate is you can really get an
enormous amount done,” he
said.

Specter, 57, was asked
about a common concern
among senators — that they

might neglect their families.
”|t’s a tough balance, but l

honestly feel I have not
neglected my two young
sons,” he said. ”l made it a

point when I was district attor-
ney [of Philadelphia] in a
tough, rigorous job to be
home every night for dinner.
I went out a lot of nights after
dinner and went back to the
office.”

Sen. Lawton Chiles, R-Fla.,
last month announced he
would not run for re-election
this year because of job ”burn—
out.” Chiles, chairman of the
Budget Committee, was the
sixth senator to announce his
retirement before the 1988
election.

”There were two options on
what to do with the school site.
One was to put up a totally new
development, and the other was
to renovate the old school to put
in smaller units,” St. John said.

”We reviewed the site plan
with the community residents in
a series of meetings in the sur-
rounding neighborhood so that
people could have input into a.

development that was affecting
their community,” St. John con-
tinued. The residents we talked to
were overwhelmingly in favor of
putting up something new.”

The complex is comprised of
40 three—storied townhouses and
24 one— and two—bedroom con-
dominiums.

”From a community organiza-
tion standpoint, we have a goal
of making these houses available.

All of the people [who buy these
houses] will be working people
who qualify for mortgages. We
have special assistance [the Pitts-
burgh Homeownership Financ-
ing plan] to make the garden
units [condominiums] more af-
fordable. Our goal is to have a
healthy mix of buyers. We don't
want to lead people to believe
that it's low-income housing,” St.
John said.

I have a complaint to make.
This complaint goes out to
whoever is in charge of the Tow-
ers laundry room.

Since I have been here, I have
seen the condition of the laundry
room steadily decline. There is al-
ways something wrong with the
washers and dryers: if they work,
they're always being used —— and
that means waiting for hours to
get one; or they don't work at all;
or even worse, they only do half
the job. A washer that doesn't
rinse or a dryer that has no heat
does me absolutely no good at
all. Something has to be done
about this, and soon.

There are over 1,800 students

party, we enjoy meeting those of
the opposite sex. After the first
few minutes of struggling to cre-
ate a conversation, many men
and women find each other in-
teresting. Eventually, they be-
come more comfortable with
each other, and talking becomes
easier.

In the following days, they may
see each other around campus, in
class, at a party or on the street
corner. Perhaps they'll talk again,
exchange phone numbers, or
study together. Time passes, they
go to movies, eat dinner and play
tennis together. They begin to
confide in one another, ask for
each other’s advice, become
good friends and become
trapped.

Traditionally, most of our
closest friends have been those of
our same sex. As children, we
identified with those of our sex
and were alienated by those of
the opposite sex, who were ru-

laundry room, not to mention all
the others that come from other
dorms on campus. I, as a student
resident, pay hundreds of dollars
every year to live on campus. All

I that I ask is that there is a laun-

dry room that works, and works
consistently. After all, isn’t part of
the money I pay for housing
(along with all the other resi-
dents), supposed to be used for
the upkeep of the laundry room?
We deserve a laundry room that
works.

CAS

I am outraged at William
Young's [column] in the Jan. 28
issue of The Pitt News, ”English
only —- a good idea.” How this
fool cannot see that this proposed

mored to have the ”cooties.”

As we passed puberty, we '

looked at the opposite sex
through our hormones and treat-
ed them as trophies to show off
to our friends.

At our age, we realize the
benefits of befriending the oppo-
site sex. Through these friend-
ships, we gain valuable
knowledge as to what the other
sex thinks about. We can under-
stand what’s going on in the other
person's mind on a date and
perhaps behave more appropri-
ately. Such knowledge is price-
less, and in order to gain access
to it, we must make certain
sacrifices.

When men and women are
close friends, certain things are
understood. It would be impos-
sible to open up to someone if
you were uncertain as to how he
or she would react. We must be
certain we can trust the person
we confide in and the relation-

bill would be discriminatory is
beyond me.

I suppose he's never visited a
foreign country where English is
not the primary language. I sug-
gest we drop him off in a small
town in Europe where no one
speaks English and let him at-
tempt to communicate. It would
be amusing to see how long it
takes him to get back to the states.

No, I am not a foreign student.
No, I don't speak any language
but English. No, I have never
visited a foreign country. Yes, I
am a sympathetic student who
has been stopped on the street to
answer a foreigner’s questions.
Yes, I do believe that it would be
easier for English speakers to in-
sist that everyone speak English,
but I am not in the habit of inflict-
ing my ideas, opinions and lan-
guage on others just to make my

ship we have. In a man-woman
friendship, this means knowing
that intimacy is forbidden.

How could we spend time
befriending someone if they
thought we were leading them on
romantically? As long as no one
hints that they feel more affection
than friendship, the friendship
grows.

Unfortunately, as a man and a
woman become better friends,
it's natural to want to express in-
timacy. However, to risk such a
close friendship for such an emo-
tion is a gamble that many peo-
ple don't want to take.

Society seems to judge men
and women above all as lovers
before friends. However, which
relationship is more important is
not always clear.

If I were one to always look for
the ”easy way out,” I would not

it would be a much quicker way

Porche 944. [...]

Forcing something on a person
usually results in anger, frustra-
tion and then abandonment. He
makes it sound that if this bill is
passed, we would be doing the
immigrants a favor by forcing
them to learn English. My answer
to that is [expletive deleted].

Maybe all of us at Pitt should
keep a watchful eye on William

Chaos on the eve of the nuclear age

Put on your coat and walk out-
side. Do you like winter? Ex-
perience winter, it’s yours.
Sometimes it seems white, high-
flown and timely; sometimes just
cruel, dark and uncanny. If global
climate changes come, would
winters be more mild, or would
they be more grueling? Would
winter be hot? The social migra-
tions which may accompany
global weather changes will be
curious. Perhaps the changes will
be cruel to us, as they were to the
dinosaurs, and push us into up-
heavals. And if those social up-
heavals are dramatic enough, it is
not unthinkable that it would lead
to war and extinction.

Several global-scale changes
are pushing. One of the more ob-
vious is the greenhouse effect.
The climatic ramifications are al-
ready underway. First, there is
this pocket, this pore above the
polar cap. It is a fascinating
glimpse of the universe, a sort of
wound on the-atmosphere, above
the Antarctic. There will be an in-
crease of skin tissue burns in the
Bahamas, so be careful when you
tan. I'm not trying to be a Cassan-
dra. You will want to be healthy
for some of the other wonders of
global change.

given in return for promises from

Reagan's

The supreme irony of the late
'80s is that_the far right (to its
friends; the lunatic right to every-
one else) thinks that Reagan is‘
soft on communism. And after
all, when you look back, his‘
record hasn't been all that good.
Reagan has managed to put new
meaning into the old dictum
”Walk softly, but carry a big
stick.” After seven years in office,
he has managed to increase the
size of the stick, but that's about
all. Despite walking very loudly,
he hasn't managed to roll back
the progress of communism in
any single arena (except Grena-
da, but to count that just under-
scores the point). Hundreds of
millions of dollars in aid later, the
Sandinistas arestill there, with as
much popular support as ever. In
Afghanistan, the Soviets have
eventually become bored with
playing the neo—imperialist game
—- hardly a case of ”rollback.”

developed anyway, despite the
new agreements, then we may

create great stress, not merely on
the population at large, but on the
social institutions which research
the advanced sciences, and
whose good works, in the past,
have included the manufacture of
enough nerve gas to poison
everything five times, the weird
dream of safe space stations for
the Chief of State and nuclear

  

bombs.

Other marvels will include po-
lar cap breaks and rising oceans,
the stunning discovery of Third
World genius, their music, their
spiritual resources and their fun-
damental humanity. This marvel
is a recognition of the network-
communities in the world.

The Earth is a whole form.
Have you ever been‘ to Disney-
land? The ”Small World” ride has
a number of rooms, in one you
will find Spanish ladies kicking
their legs, hombres in sombreros
chugging their ale, singing ”It’s a
Small World” in Spanish. Then
the doors open to Paris. There's
the Eiffel Tower and Pierre in his
beret. The theme is very true. We
can circumnavigate the globe in
mere hours.

The Earth needs to be ap-
proached as a whole form. The

engineering of the communica- I

tions networks would be more
lucrative for everyone. The
designers of currency exchange
programs, of food access and
education should be cognizant of
the whole form.

Economics, despite politics, are
fulfilling this vision. We live in a
global economy. Restrict trade in
one field and trade is in turn res-
tricted in another. Protect Ameri-
can Steel and restrict capital
investment. Unpopular as it may
seem, the United States is mutu-
ally interdependent with the

whole form of global economics,
and this isn't exactly something
to resent. In fact, the Earth can be
a pretty successful place for most
all of us, if approached as a
whole form.

The world -power line, not yet
in place, will be complete once
we have spanned the Bering
Straits. This will bring the Asian
power grid together with the
North American power grid. The
Bering Straits lie between Alaska
and Siberia, the Russian menace
and the American menace, as it
were. The Little Diomedes Island,
U.S. territory, and the Big Dio-
medes Island, U'.S.S.R. territory,
are the linkage point. Is this
farfetched? It was Buckminster
Fuller's dream. Prime Minister
Trudeau and Brezhnev endorsed
it. P
You may remember another
dream that pertained to the Ber-
ing Straits, and it makes a perti-
nent metaphor. Lynne Cox, age
30,san athlete whose fame in-
cluded a successfulswim of the
English Channel, decided to
swim the Bering Straits last sum-
mer. She was told she'd die; Her
body temperature dropped to 94
degrees. But she succeeded,
against all odds, she succeeded.
And in that irony, in that
metaphor, we can discern the hu-

mor and poten.tial‘l_of such

dreams.

gan made about the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics was
back when we still had a Cold
War to speak of — i.e. years ago.

So, it must be getting lonely out
there, now that the Reagan ad-
ministration has changed ideo-
logical tracks. You can still have
the company of Jesse Helms and
Jeane Kirkpatrick, but that's cold
comfort for the loss of national
cultural and political hegemony.
Thank — somebody -— that the

a American populace is finally be-

ginning to return to its middle—of-
the—road senses.

One of the truths —— or rather,
points of common consensus, the
closest approximation it's
reasonable to ask for —- that Rea-
gan seems to have realized, after
many years, is that the best way
to fight communism is to leave it
to its own devices. All the guns
and money in the U.S. defense
budget hardly bought back an
inch of good capitalist ground
from communism’s clutches, but
who cares? Communism is crack-
ing up from the inside. Econom-
ic reality routs ideology.
Decentralization of planning,
profit margins, personal business-
es —— from Shanghai to Budapest,
Vladivostock to Varna, capitalism
is creeping back as the ramparts
of communism crumble. Didn't
we know all along that socialism
was economically bankrupt? All
we have to do now is sit back and
watch it fall to bits before our
very eyes.

Or so it might seem. It's worth
trying to put recent economic re-
forms in a little perspective. Sup-

pose capitalism had been first
introduced around 1917, and by
the 1980s, people were realizing
that pure capitalism just couldn't
work. That you might have to in-
troduce controls on the operation
of the free market, such as anti-
trust laws and minimum wage
laws. That capitalism tends to cre-
ate an unemployed or underem—
ployed underclass, and that the
government might have to inter-
vene with public welfare. That
the absurd distortions of wealth
distribution engendered by the

operation of a capitalist system-

might have to be moderated by
redistribution through taxation.
Would you conclude that capital-
ism is crumbling from the inside?
That it's only a matter of time be-
fore it falls to bits?

Certainly, there are economic
reforms taking place in socialist
countries, but these don't neces-
sarily point to a withdrawal from
socialism. Gorbachev is not be-
ing disingenuous when he claims
that perestroika is consistent with
Leninist socialist ideals, in fact
more consistent than the peudo-
socialist systems that had gone
before.

Economic reforms in the cur--
rent stagnation of socialism are to
be reformed, but we shouldn't
necessarily see them as the in-
evitable regression to capitalism.
For by the same reasoning, we
would have to see the ugly face
of socialism peering through the
numerous cracks in the aging
edifice of capitalism.

’Skins second-quarter spurt breaks Broncos

By Dave Goldberg

AP Football Writer

SAN DIEGO -— Doug Wil-
liams, Timmy Smith and Ricky
Sanders ripped apart the Denver
defense with a record 35-point,
356-yard second quarter as the
Washington Redskins won Super
Bowl XXII by routing the Denver
Broncos 42-10 and shutting
down John Elway.

Washington spotted Denver a
10-0 lead, then came from be-
hind for the seventh time in 14
wins this year to give the NFC its
fourth straight lopsided victory in
the NFL’s championship game.

It was the Redskins’ second Su-

per Bowl victory in five years.
And it was an eerie reprise for the
Broncos,’ whose coach, Dan
Reeves, said they were haunted
by their 39-20 loss to the New
York Giants in last year's game,
a contest in which they led at hal-
ftime then were outgained 200-2
over the next 20 minutes.

If that was a haunting, this one
was a possession.

Consider this:

0 Williams, the MVP, was play-
ing less than 24 hours after root
canal on a molar, and set a Su-
per Bowl record with 340 yards
on 18-of-29 passing, 306 in the
first half. Only six other quarter-
backs have passed for 300 yards

in a full Super Bowl. The four TD
passes by the first black quarter-
back to play in this ultimate game
tied the record for a Super Bowl.

0 The 35 second-quarter points
— on just 18 plays —- were 14
more than the Super Bowl record
for a quarter and the most in a
single period in NFL playoff his-
tory. They used just 5:47 to score
them andscored on five straight
possessions, failing only when
Williams downed the ball on the
last play of the half.

0 Smith, a surprise starter for
George Rogers, rushed for 131
yards in the first half, five more
than he had in the entire regular
season. He finished with 204

Panthers soar over Eagles
despite Barros’ leadership

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

BOSTON —— Dana Barros, the Big East's
leading scorer, had one of his typical
high-scoring games Saturday night, but
something happened to Barros that usual-
ly spells doom for the Boston College
Eagles.

Barros ran out of gas;

Indeed, Barros’ 30 points on 8-for-17
shooting (four of eight from three—poin’t

1’ range) and perfect 10-for-10 foul shoot-

ing kept the Eagles close against Pitt.

And Barros even let his teammates in
on the action - of course, only when
neccessary. When Barros drove to the
hoop, forcing two and sometimes three
Panther defenders to converge on him, he
had the sense to dish off to his wide-open
teammates. That's how Barros got his five
assists.

His 40 minutes played tells another
story.

If Boston College could have afforded
to give Barros a breather, maybe he
wouldn't have missed his last three shots.
And maybe he wouldn't have lost the ball
out of bounds on a fast break late in the
game. A hoop there would have cut Pitt's
lead to four.

But Barros could only carry his team so
far. The rest of the Eagles weren't much
help as Pitt came away with a 73-67 win
before a crowd of 8,685 at Boston
Garden.

’’[In the second half], Barros started go-
ing crazy [scoring]. I know there's a lot
of thought as to why.you don't just let him
go like that all the time, but the kid gets
run down. “I think he just gets tired,” said
Jim O'Brien, the Boston College coach.

”We’re asking [Barros] every time
down the floor for the last seven minutes
[to score]. We're running plays for him ev-
ery single time, and the kid is just going

At different junctures, Pitt appeared on
the verge of blowing the game wide
open, but the pesky Eagles kept chipping
away at the lead. With Pitt ahead by 17
points, 58-41, at the 12:38 mark, Boston
College went on a 15-3 run, cutting the
Panthers’ lead to five, 61-56.

Smith and Lane each hit two foul shots,
but Boston College countered with two
Jamie Benton foul shots and four points
by Barros to make it 65-62.

Neither the Panthers’ lead nor the game
was secure until Charles Smith, Pitt's
senior center, rebounded a Jerome Lane
miss and banked in the shot, giving Pitt
a five-point lead, 67-62, with 1:38 left.

Moments later, Lane extended the lead
to seven with an off—ba|anced shot in the
paint off his own missed 1—and—1 free
throw.

”Good players make big plays, and
they make their team win. Charles Smith's
rebound basket to go up five was real big,
and we don't rebound on Lane's missed
foul shot, and he makes a crazy shot in
the lane,” O'Brien said.

The win was Pitt's fifth straight in the
Big East after a conference—opening loss
at Georgetown. The Panthers [ranked
11th by The Associated Press] are 15-2.

Boston College fell to 11-8 and 3-6.

Jamie Benton had 17 points for the Ea-
gles, and Tyrone Scott and Steve Benton
added 10 each.

Pitt's next game is Wednesday at St.
John's, another streaking Big East team.
Lou Carnesecca’s Redmen have won five
consecutive league games after losing at
Pitt Jan. 9.

Pitt had 17-point leads on three
separate occasions against Boston Col-
lege, but the Eagles wouldn't let the Pan-
thers embarrass them on their home floor.

’’I don't think you can blow a Big East
team out on the road,” said Sean Miller,
Pitt's point guard. ’’It’s tough with that

to be rundown.”

yards in 22 carries, including his
first two pro touchdowns. That
broke Marcus Allen's record of
191 set in the Raiders’ 38-9 rout
of the Redskins in 1984.

0 Sanders, who caught two of
the four TD passes, had 131 yards
on receptions in the first half and
finished with a record 193 yards
and nine receptions.

The 356 yards gained by
Washington in the second quart-
er were just 17 less than its
season-long average for a full
game and its six touchdowns set
a Super Bowl record.

It didn't start that way.

The Broncos scored on their
first offensive play, a 56-yard pass

from Elway to Ricky Nattiel, and
added three more points on their
second possession on Rich Karlis’

‘ 24-yard field goal.

Fifty-three seconds into the se-
cond quarter, Williams threw an
80-yard touchdown pass to
Sanders. Less than four minutes
later, it was a 27-yarder to Gary
Clark, followed by a 58-yard TD
run by Smith, his first pro touch-
down; a 50-yarder to Sanders and
an 8-yarder to Clint Didier.

Beginning with the 56-yard
touchdown pass from Elway to
Nattiel on their first play from
scrimmage, the Broncos befud-
dled the Redskins in the first

Lady Panthers show true colors, beat Friars

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

When the Lady Friars of Provi-
dence visited Fitzgerald Field
House Saturday afternoon, there
was an ever-present sense of deja
vu in the rafters.

The Pitt Lady Panthers basket-
ball team had met Providence
once already this season in the
first Big East matchup of the year
for both teams.

Pitt hung tough with the Lady
Friars in that game, even leading
at the half by seven points.

But the second half belonged
to Providence as they erased the
halftime deficit and won 86-78.

On Saturday, the Lady Panthers
again built a seven-point halftime
lead 38-31.

Enter that foreboding feeling.

,Led by Doreen Ferguson's 23

second-half points, Providence
ran Pitt's lead down to three with

only 1:25 left in the game.

But the Lady Panthers showed
great resiliency down the stretch
as Jennifer Shingler hit on both
ends of four consecutive 1-and-1
opportunities to raise Pitt to a
91-82 victory. .

”No one beats Providence like
this," Lady Panther head coach
Kirk Bruce said, somewhat spell-
bound. ”Providence beat [first
place] Syracuse by 37 points last
week.”

Syracuse had previously defeat-
ed Pitt 84-68.

Providence had been in a first-
place tie with Syracuse and
perennial Big East power Vil-
lanova.

The Lady Panthers improved
their record to 9-10, 2-7 in the Big
East, while Providence fell to 9-9,
5-3.

Nine players scored for the
Lady Panthers, four in double
figures. Junior forward Deidra

Baker scored 20 points, captain

Sally Sheerer added 12, and Shin-H

gler ended with 17 points, 11
from the free-throw line.

Sheerer also had a game high
11 rebounds.

6 Sophomore forward Lorri John-
son also continued her dominat-
ing play with a team high 23
points before fouling out with 59
seconds remaining. ‘

0 If the chapter on Craig Hey-

It's going to be great to see him

If Davis holds up the academ-

two years of eligibility remaining.

Mike Gottfried had talked to the
vice president of the Green Bay

Gottfried. Though the rumors of
Gottfried’s going to USC, Ohio

ANALYSIS

Gottfried’s leaving that was dis-
turbing, but rather the possibility
of leaving coupled with the fact
that,Gottfried has repeatedly said
he plans on being coach at Pitt for
a long, long time.

Was Gottfried pulling our leg
when he said he planned on be-
ing at Pitt for a long time? Much
to Gottfried’s credit, he thorough-
ly squelched the Packers’ hopes
and reaffirmed his strong commit-
ment to Pitt by telling the Packer
organization that he was not in-
terested in leaving the university.

0 Considering the success of
Temple basketball and the fact
that the Big East Conference has
not taken in any new members
since it admitted Pitt, a Big East
expansion to include Temple or

 

even some other team, might
seem like a good possibility.

Not so, according to Pitt athlet-
ic director Ed Bozik. Bozik said
that while there certainly are
”many worthy candidates,” an
expansion of the league is
definitely ”not on the agenda” at
this time. The lively debate over
whether Temple would thrive or
get crunched in the Big East rages
on.

0 According to Pitt hoops
broadcaster Bill Hillgrove, if you
were to talk to people 30 years
from now you would think the
actual attendance at the Pitt-
Providence game was closer to
30,000 instead of 6,798. Like
Forbes Field when Mazeroski hit
the home run, everybody will
have been there, or so they will
say. For those who were not
there, it was like Pitt had just won

Pittsburgh Gladiators (Pitts-
burgh’s arena football franchise)
are going to be back for an en-
core. I know the Gladiators drew
a good average attendance last

you who enjoyed the games, but
my excitement level is approach-
ing zero. »“

0 I read in a local newspape
that the Pittsburgh Pirates have
asked catcher Mike Lavalliere to
take a pay cut, never mind that
he batted around .300 and won
the Gold Glove, that the Pirates
payroll is already one of the
lowest in the league and that tick-
et sales have skyrocketed. Could
the Pirate organization be getting
cocky?

0 Speaking of the Pirates, keep
your eye on Pirate pitcher
Vicente Palacios, a possibk
rookie-of-the-year.

0 According to Pitt assistant
coach and former A|l—America
linebacker Sal Sunseri, Mike
Gottfried will indeed be at Pitt for
a long time. Sunseri said at the
Bluebonnet Bowl that a major an-
nouncement would soon be
made regarding an extension of
Gottfried’s contract.

This isn't so surprising. I im-
agine the university is pretty hap-
py with a season that included
wins over West Virginia, Notre
Dame, and Penn State.

0 Best of luck to Craig Hey-
ward in the pros.

0 The only reason I am ending

this column here is b€CaUS€11;xl~-

don't have enough space to list
all the reasons why Pitt should

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February I, 1988

 

Women's

figures 15 consecutive games and
leads Pitt in Big East scoring and
rebounding.

Ferguson paced Providence
with 29 points, while Liz Lawlor
added 13, and Andrea Mangum
was held to 12 points.

Mangum had scored 16 points
and grabbed 15 rebounds in a
67-63 loss to St. John's.

’’I told the girls before the game

Qhat we had our backs against the
wall,” Bruce remarked, "then we

played hard the entire game.

’’If we play hard, we can beat
good teams.”

”We’re on a roll," added the
high-scoring Johnson after her
team's third victory in the last

four outings. ”I think we got it

now."

The Lady Panthers have indeed
been on a roll as of late. After a
6-2 early season, Pitt lost a record
seven consecutive games before

defeating league partner Seton
Hall 85-79.

Since that game, the Lady Pan-
thers defeated Cleveland State,
lost to Villanova and beat
Providence.

The Lady Panthers’ next game
is against cross-town non-
conference rival Robert Morris.
Tipoff is slated for 7:30 p.m. at
Sewall Center.

LADY PANTHER NOTES:
Sheerer played all 40 minutes
against Providence, the first time
a Lady Panther has played an en-
tire game this season  Amy Hol-
man hit two clutch free throws
with six seconds remaining
against Providence. Holman is
shooting 88 percent, making 22
of25 shots Pitt was ninth in the
country in 3-point field goal per-
centage last week, hitting 38.2
percent of their shots  Pitt's 91
points were the most scored by
the Lady Panthers this season.

crowd. They get some momen-
tum, and they make a run at
you."

Added Evans: ”Any road win is
a good win. I thought Boston Col-
lege played very well. It's a trib-
ute to them, plus we're playing a
lot of freshmen.”

Evans also pointed to Lane's
play and the play of the Pitt
bench as reasons why Boston
College was able to stay close.

Three Pitt substitutes (Bobby
Martin, Darelle Porter and Nate
Bailey) played a combined 19
minutes and scored just three
points.

Lane scored 1 1 points and had
a season-tying low of seven re-
bounds

”Lane wasn't up for this game
as much as the past few games,”
Evans said.

After leading by 10 at halftime,

43-33, Pitt jumped out to a 56-39
lead with 13:34 left. Jason Mat-
thews scored 10 of his 15 points
during the run, including two
three—pointers.

But it was an All-America type
performance by Smith that keyed
Pitt to victory. The 6-foot—1O
center scored 25 points, his
highest scoring output since his
30-point effort against Florida Jan.
2.

Smith also grabbed 10 re-
bounds and blocked three shots
as he dominated an inferior
Boston College front line.

”We're living and dying with
three pointers. We're real close.
We're one or two inside guys

away from being in the middle of

the pack in this conference. I
think we're very, very close,”
O'Brien said.

PANTHER NOTES: Porter

played only two minutes and

failed to score in a game for the
first time this year Smith is now
fourth on Pitt's all-time scoring

list with 1,755 points O'Brien
and Evans couldn't ask for much
better foul shooting. Pitt was
23-of-26 (88.5 percent), and
Boston College was 18-of-19
(94.5 percent)  Coming off a
game in which Lane shattered the
backboard, Pitt went dunkless for
only the third time this year.

quarter with just about everything
in their diverse playbook.

There was a halfback pass to El-

way, the first reception by a quar-
terback in Super bowl history; a
quarterback draw, shovel passes
and runs when Washington was
looking for the pass.
1 Their second drive stalled at
the Washington 7 and resulted in
3 field goal, their third was
thwarted when Alvin Walton, the
strong safety who had 2‘/2 sacks,
dropped Elway for an 18-yard
loss, pushing the Broncos out of
field goal range.

Washington continued to start
in bad field position -— its first
four possessions began inside its
20 and it fifth began at the 20.

The Redskins were also killing
themselves — Clark, Sanders and
Kelvin Bryant all dropped passes
in the first quarter and a holding
call on Don Warren erased a

I 25-yard run by Smith. ,

Finally, they did something
right, starting the second period
the way the Broncos started the
first.

On their first offensive play of
the quarter, Williams, who
missed two plays on the previous
series when he slipped and

suffered a hyperflexed left knee, 7

hit Sanders on an 80-yard touch-
down play to cut it to 10-7.

Sanders raced by Mark Haynes
—— the way Nattiel beat Wilburn
—— and caught the ball in stride at
the 37 and raced home on a play
that tied the Super Bowl record
for the longest pass set by Jim
Plunkett of the Raiders against the
Eagles in 1981.

Washington's fifth touchdown,
an 8-yard pass to Didier, came af-
ter Wilburn picked off an Elway
pass at his own 21. Seven plays
later, on third and 4, Williams
lofted it softly to his tight end in
the corner to tie the TD pass
record and shatter yet another
record — points in a quarter in
any playoff game.

From then on, it was academic.

The Redskins scored the only
TD of the second half on Smith's
4-yard run early in the fourth
quarter to break the touchdown
record set by several teams.

gel was wrestling at 177 pounds,
when he was caught in a front
headlock. A few seconds later, he
passed out and fell to the floor.
He was then turned over and
pinned.

In a situation like this, the
referee usually stops the match
immediately for safety reasons.
Instead, the match continued,
and Tongel was pinned.

”The ref was in the dark on this
one,” said Stottlemyer. ”It is real-
ly goofy. You have to stop the
match in that situation. He didn't
realize what was going on and
must have thought that Mike was
giving up.

”We ended up losing the
match by those six points. It was
a real fluke. It's like a basketball
player sinking a 94-footer as the
buzzer sounds. It just doesn't
happen that often.”

The Panthers’ record now
stands at 7-2-1 and 1-1 in the
Eastern Wrestling League.

Bloomsburg Friday night at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -
Center Rony Seikaly equaled his
career high with 33 points as
1 7th-ranked Syracuse took com-
mand early in the second half and
beat No. 8 Michigan 89-71
Sunday.

Seikaly matched his previous
career best, which he reached in
last season's NCAA playoff game
against Florida, while Derrick
Coleman collected 18 points as
Syracuse improved its record to
15-5. Michigan dropped to 17-3.

Michigan, after falling behind
53-40 with 16:01 to play, closed
the gap to 61-58 with 10:42 left,
as Cary Grant scored nine of his

team-high 22 points in that span.
But Syracuse responded with 1 1
straight points and went onto
rout the Wolverines in the nation-
ally televised game.

Michigan, which got 21 points
from Terry Mills, built a 17-9 lead
in the first 6‘/2 minutes.

Syracuse still trailed 24-16 mid-
way through the first half when
it switched from a 2-3 zone
defense to a man-to-man and
went to a bigger lineup. The
switches seemed to ignite the
Orangemen, who then scored 21
of the next 31 points and took a
39-34 halftime lead.
