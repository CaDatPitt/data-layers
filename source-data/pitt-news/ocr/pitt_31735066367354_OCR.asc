Block ‘P’ Riot
Cancels Refund

For Members

By MARLENE STEPLN
No refunds will be made by
Block P to the members, Mary
Grace’, MacKenzie, chairman of
the block, announced today.
“The money will not be given
back,” said Miss MacKenzie, “be-
cause it is needed to pay for the
many cards that were ripped,
torn, and destroyed at the Penn
State game. Students did not seem
to realize that six hundred cards
cost one hundred dollars. A
“It is a shame that the inno-
cent must suffer because of the
childish behavior of some peo-
ple_. but the cards must be paid
for." c
In September, Block P tickets
were sold at$1.50 with the under-
standing that a student had a job
to do at half-time. If this job was
completed and every game at-
tended, the student would receive
a refund of $1 at the end of the
season. j‘ . _ =
 Through the season, these re-
quisites were followed well until
the last gamei Not only were sav-

tion,"but the time, effort, and
planning of somany people we're
destroyed in a matter of ﬁfteen
minutes. . ’

Because of this, the chairmen
of the block felt that they had
justiﬁable reason for refusing to
pay students the refund.

The University has hinted that future expansion plans
will necessarily place rigid restrictions on students bringing
automobiles to the University. — ’ »

In a letter to Council President Thomas J. Gallagher
concerning plans for the erection of three circular dormitory
towers which will house 1868 men students, Chancellor

OLitchﬁeld made this proposal:
“We shall impose restrictions
upon students in residence having
or bringing automobiles with
them to the University to the end
that the parking problem in Oak-
land will not be aggravated and
may, indeed, be sdmewhat allev-
iated."
Council Disapproved
Plans for the Fifth Avenue dor-
mitories wcre at first met with
disapproval by City Council on

Bowers’ Play’.
To Open Soon

. ‘Just You and Me’
Ready for Saturday

“Just You and Me,” a one act
play written by Bill Bowers, Arts
senior, will be presented. this
Saturday at 8 p.m. in Dining
Room A, SU. There will be no
charge for admission.
This is the ﬁrst play of a series
of student productions which the
Pitt Players hope to present. This
program is designed to give stu-
'dents a first hand opportunity
with ;.playwrit.ing, directing and
producing.

Copies of the original draft of’
Bower’s play will, be passed out
to the audience beforethe show
starts. Following the presenta-
tion of the revised production
will be a short coffee break and
a question and answer period.

Students participating in the
play are: Linda Lee, “Lola Matta,
Judy Stoner, and Paul Kanfer.
The play, which was written for
Dr. Ralph Allen’s playwriting
course, relates a conflict between
two older women for the love of
the one’s« daughter.

Bowers, a speech major, has
acted in many productions of Pitt
Players. This part of Hines, the
knifethrowcr in Pajama Game,

award in 1959: Graduating in
April, he hopes to work in the
field of publiclrelations or tele-
vision. ’

Ends With Last
Minute Deluge

2765 Students Sign
Up In Final Week Of
Winter Scheduling

B)’ JD! NELSON
The Oﬁice of Student Rec-
ords was stormed with the_
expected last minute rushas
registration for the Winter
Trimester ended last Wed-

’ nesday.

Richard C. Hodges. director of
the Office of Student Records,
said that 2765 students registered
in the last week while 6152 stu-
dents registered in the previous
four and a half weeks.

“There are still about 2000
unregistered students; that we
are trying to locate and ﬁnd
out why they have failed to reg-
ister,” commented Hodges.

Registration kits will be avail-
able in each dean’s office on and
during the last week of school.
Those not called for will be mail-
ed to the students’ home address-
es at the end of the week.

“We plan to change the regis-
tration kits for the coming tri-
mesters,” Hodges said. “The bulk
of cards in the present kit is a
bother for students to complete,
and the kits are expensive to send
through the mail.-Last trimester
the University spent $2500 on
postage for the kits.”

Hodges’ hopes that. the kits can
be condensed to an invoice and
one schedule card. If there is a
suitable' duplicating machine able
to reproduce the information re-
ceived in the returned kits, the
efficiency of the whole operation
would be increased.

E&M 
Dance for Friday

Engineering and Mines Cabinet
is holding a square dance this
Friday from 8:30 p.m. to midnight
at the Main Lodge in South Park.
S Refreshments will be served
and a caller will be present.

Membership cards which were
purchased for the first social ev-
ent will be needed for admission.

The 1960 Faculty Directory is
now out for distribution. This
new edition, distributed to the
various faculty and administra-
tive oﬁices, will be sold by the
University Book Store.

ﬁnes of literature.”

logy from Harvard Divinity

ard in the Psychology of Religion.

Announcement

By TOM Mc-GOVERN

Although only ten senators
were present at the Student -meet-
ing Monday, the quorum was not
challenged, and business proceded
as usual. \

The Senate ﬁrst acted upon a
suggestion which had been made
by Herb Margolis, activities man-
ager of the Pitt Players. Margolis’
suggestion was that metal frames
be installed in the University’s
elevators,‘ in which a type of daily

bulletin of current campus events.

could be inserted. ,

Dick Wagner made a motion
that they investigate the cost of
such a project. Larry Land sec-
onded the motion, and it was un-
animously approved.

The subjects of commencement,
classroom crowding, and recogni-
tion of outstanding service were
discussed.

Land then made _a motion that
the University’s‘athletic trophies,
particularly the current ones, be
displayed Where more people
would be likely to see them. The

5" Challenging and satisfying career opportunities are
open to college graduates in_the Federal Service. Through-
out the United States and in foreign countries, over two.
and a half million people are employed by the U. S. gov-

ernment. A -
., The public image of the bureaucrat involved in routine
fandnnnecessary work is now changing, because of many
improvements instituted in the Federal Service in the way
of salary increases, advancement opportunities, and new
recruitment techniques. ' - ‘
 Finding top college graduates to ﬁll government posi-
, :5 .tions is the chief“aim of those concerned with improving
‘ - the Federal Service. To accomplish this, much of the red
tape and excessive security investigations formerly in-
* volved in securing government jobs have been eliminated.
,7 The recruitment program‘ has been streamlined so that stu——
dents now need only take one examination, the Federal
I ‘Service Entrance Examination. It is given several times a
year on this campus. , .t
, A student planning to enter government work has two
choices upon graduation. He may enroll in a graduate
school, such as the University's School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs, or he may enter public service directly.
If he’ chooses the latter, he can either receive in-service
training, or continue in graduate school while he is work-
"Ting, with the government assuming all or part of the ex-

- . Next week the Federal Careers Conference will be
, ‘held at the University to provide students_with information

istration, engineering, and even liberal arts students will
ﬁnd that there are positions open for which their area of
study will qualify them. ‘ . ' ~
‘F Speakers from many government agencies will be on
hand to answer questions and -offer suggestions. Fifteen
;,j.c'olleges in the tri-state area will participate in the pro-

Students who are undecided about their career plans

Missles from

- By Harriet Wellner ,
Although the conduct of most Pitt students who
participated in the half-time presentations at the
‘ football games this year deserves compliment, this
note of approval cannot be ‘extended to all-groups.
At the Penn State game, members of the Block

P ﬂashcard section, in defiance of
their purpose, presented a color-
ful exhibition of ﬂying cards, in-
stead of the usual pictures of
“Panther Heads” and other ap-
propriate designs. Although ﬁre’-
works usually receive the ap-
plause‘ of most spectators, this
similar display did not. (Excuse

me, the engineering section
under the banner of Block E was
cheering.)

In 15 minutes, these sophis-

ticated juvenile delinquents not only destroyed ap-
proximately l0O0 cards, but also left cuts, slashes
and bruises as rememb‘rances' for students and _
visitors. Even when the husband of a woman who
-was hit in the eye with one of the 12x12 cards,
protested to the mob, they still refused to discon- .‘

tinue their frenzy. _

books” students are not permitted to drink at Uni-
versity events, but the ruling and the ostentatious
facts did not coincide at this football game.
Policy of Containment _

Since the reputation of the University seems to
be involved, serious thought should be given at this
time to the problem of drinking. If the University
proposes that the present policy is maintained, then
some method of prevention will have to be used
to restrict students with gallon jugs of ?whiskey
sours’ from entering the stadium. As a last resort
the entire student section might be caged in from
the rest of the stadium.

An alternative approach to this problem would
be to consider permitting students to drink at cer- ~
ta'in campus events such as football games. This
type of psychology in dealing with students seems
to be much more effective than the disciplinaria/n

Noonday Programs

Becoming Partisan

i Editor, The Pitt News:
I would like to call to issue

the increasingly partisan nature.

of one of the University spon-
sored activities here on campus.
‘I am referring to the Midday
series which seems to be the
mouth-piece of a so-called “lib-
eral” faction.

I came to -the University of
Pittsburgh in search of a liberal
education. However, the Midday
Series, an interesting and im-
portant facet of campus life,
seems to have perverted the
meaning of “liberal.”

Although basically a question
of" semantics, I feel that the
misguided nature of the Midday
Series should be called on the
carpet to answer a few ques-
,tions. I would‘ like to suggest
the following: V

Docs excluding Conservatives
and packing the Midday pro-

grams with Liberals truly denote,

a “liberal mindedness” ‘on the
part of those in charge?
Could not the policy of the
Midday Series in its “liberal
packing’.’ be termed philosophic-
al bigotry? ‘ .-
Is there any possibility of bet-
ter programming in the future?
' Reviewing the questipn at
hand, I think even those of the
Midday Series and those follow-
ers of the “liberal thought” will
have to admit that tooinuch of
one thing and a neglect of an-
other, whether on purpose of. by
mistake, can only result in an

Purpose. of Police

Editor, The Pitt News:
' One would wonder just what
is the purpose of the police offi-

'cer stationed at the womcn’s

dorms on a Saturday evening. Is
he theresolely to give out tick-
ets, or to help maintain order
and decorum? _ 1

Consider a recent. weekend.
The traffic jam at 1:30 was in-
credible, but the officer merely
‘stood, his arms folded across his
chest, watching but not making
any attempt. to straighten. things
out.

Then he turned away, noticed
that one car which was parked
had been there more than the
allowed ﬁfteen minutes, and
took out his ticket book. Then
he saw that the owner wasin
thecar (the poor fellow had
been careless enough to allow
plenty of time.-in which to get
his girl home and so had arrived
more than ﬁfteen minutes before
1:30), but this‘ phased him not.

No tap on the window to re-

mind the driver that he had_ i
‘used up his time (perhaps the

proud protector of the law didn’t
want to disturb the fellow); the
officer merely continued to ﬁll
out the ticket.

The presence of an officer may
be a wise thing, but maybe the
University should consider WHY

the officer is desired, and then)

make’ sure that he, too, knows
why he is there. . ‘

Visitors Have Standout

Of .1960 Olympic Team

By JACK SMITH
With football spikes ﬁnally hung up, the Panther basket-
ball team prepares for a rugged 24—game schedule which

    Purdue:

Nine Lettermen
Return for i 61 .
M at Season

Coach“, Rex Peery will‘ have
nine returning letterinen from ,, ,

opens Friday evening-at the Field House with the Boiler-
makers of Purdue, then takes the Panthers to Annapolis to

 

face Navy.

The Panthers appear to have as rough a schedule as last

year. Michigan. Army, Villanova,$

iMermen Hold

St. John's and the Steel Bowl
which will include Duquesne, Col-
gate and- Tennessee are part of
the Panthers’ formidable oppo-
nents. ' .
Coach Bob Timmons has seven
lettermen back from a team last
year that posted an 11-14 mark.
Against Purdue the Panthers were
clobbered 91-79. The Boilermak-

'ers last year had a team compos-
ted primarily of sophomores.

Fitting Test

With many of these players
back, including Olympic basket-
ball star Terry Dischinger, the
Panthers appear to have a fitting
test in their opening game.

Purdue also has a height ad-
vantage over the Panthers. With
the graduation of John Mills,
one of the Cats’ top rebounders

last year, the Panthers have a

problem in the rebound depart-

ment, according to Coach Tim-
mons.

John Fridley, 6' 5", considered
to be the Panthers’ top deiensive
threat has been moved under the
boards to help the rebound prob-

lem. Fridley scored better than,

12‘ points a game last year.
— Punch Divided
From the inside slot Fridley is
expected to score more. The Pan-
thers, however, are without a
scorer of the caliber of former Al-
American Don Hennon.

“I think our scoring punch
will be divided,” Timmons said.
“This should help, but unless we
can get the ball off the boards.
we will still be in trouble.”

-Last year the Panthers relied
primarily on ball control, working
for the shot under the board. This
year, however, the Panthers will
have to shoot more.

Sophomore Starts

“We will have to be a running,
shooting ball club. If We don’t,
we’re in trouble,” Timmons said.

Probable starters Friday ac-
cording to the Panthers’ ﬂoor
mentor will be Fridley, Don

Steinhart, 6’ 4", Dick Falenski,
-6’ 1", Ben Jinks, 6' 3”, and Bob

Sankey. 6' 4".

Jinks, a sophomore from East:

Meadow, Long Island, stepped in-
to a starting berth, off his fresh-
man play. “He has all the moves
to be an outstanding performer,”
Timmons reports. Jinks, a ﬁne
shooter and ball handler, will play
in the backcourt.

Other Panthers who are ex-
pected to see action against Pur-
due are Paul Lazor, Tom Maloney,
Bill Shay, Darwin Smith and
Howard Lockhart.

Both Lazor and l\/Taloney have
a chance at a starting position.

Against Navy last year the Pan-
ther lost 76-49. The Midshipmen
hold a 10-6 advantage over the
Panthers. ‘

Arsenal Pool

It seems a little chilly to
think about swimming, but
the indoor season is fast ar-
riving for Coach Ben Grady’s
Panther swimming team.
Grady, ushering in his 22nd

year at the helm of the mermen,
has been drilling his team in daily
workouts at Arsenal High School’s
pool in Lawrenceville.

Grady has to mold a team this
season without Jim, Emert, the
champion freestyler, who formed
the nucleus of his squad in re-

cent years. Bart Haas and Jerry

Irwin, who have been selected as
co-captains ,and are expected to
carry the scoring load.

Haas is expected to score
heavily for the mermen in his
freestyle specialty. Irwin, who is
normally a top-ﬂight diver, swam
the breaststroke in the medley re-
lay event which the Panthers won
in the Eastern Collegiate cham-
pionships. He may be called upon
to perform a dual role this year
too.

Grady has six other lettermen
to build his team around, but he
is counting heavily on soph-
omores. “We have no stars on
the team,” Grady remarked,
“but we have a better balanced
team than last year. Our fresh-
men performed well last year

Thirteen Years ago it was pri-

or four teams came from Mary-

land, Ohio, and New York to
enter in the competition. '

Teams are coming, this week,
from schools in eighteen states as
well as the University College of
the West Indies from Jamaica, St.
Michael’s of Toronto, the Uni-

In 1957 WPDU came in second,
behind the University of Miami;
in ‘58, they took first over Ala-

According to cross-examination

style, each debater gives only one
formal eight-minute speech in-
stead of two. Each speaker speaks
again by cross-questioning an op-

" Dr. Mary Roberts, director of
WPDU, saysvthat this form of
debate “. . . helps to sharpen
the analysis of the debaters so
that the real: issues come to the
foreground. It‘s livelier,” she
continued. “and it’s more inter-
esting to the audience, because
the audience see where the
clash lies.”

All the teams will debate ﬁve
rounds. In every round each team
will earn a certain number of
“speakers points” which are rat-
ings given by judges. At the end
