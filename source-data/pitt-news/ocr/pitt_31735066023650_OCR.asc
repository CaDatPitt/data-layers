Semester-At-Sea Debated by Posvar, Cottam at FAS Nbeting  

By FRED BEERS I
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Semester-at Sea program is an
experiment with “potential for
exceeding its existing merit,”
according to Pitt Chancellor Wesley
Posvar at Thursday’s Faculty -of
Arts and Sciences Council meeting.
“This could bring us very very

favorable publicity in the next cou-

ple of years," Posvar said.

Richard Cottam, professor ofpol-
itical Science disagreed. “The
Semester-at-Sea program is not the
kind ofthing that adds to the univer-
sity's image as an important and

, serio us international institution,"

i Cottam said.

The Semester-at—Sea program,
was previously based at the Univer-

sity of Colorado.

“It fit their image as a country
club campus but not ours as an inter-
national institution." Cottam said.

Keith-McDuffie, academic dean
of the upcoming voyage, said the
basic problem is the image ofa ship.

“Because of this Love Boat image,
some people can't figure out what it
is you're trying to do,“ McDuffie
said.

McDuffie added he believes the
main objection being aired is that
energies are being placed in the
undergraduate level. i

' “We will not make a name with
the Semester-at Sea program in the
international studies field at the
graduate level, but we will be able to
say we have a strong undergraduate

program that will broadenour stu-
dents in a truly international dimen-
sion, whichis what general
education is all about. It depends on
how you look at it." McDuffie ex-
plained.

Cottam, however, said the issue
deals priorities.

“I would rather see UClS (Univer-
sity Center For International Stu-
dies) energies focusedfon something
I consider more Central in terms of
international research and educa-

tion,” Cottam said. “I'd like to see 0

UCIS move in the direction of
innovative, vigorous research pro-
grams." ,

Sociobiology is just a racist-as
Nazism and apartheid in South
Africa, claim members of the Inter-

national Committee Against,

Racism (lNCAiR),_who hope to stop
the teaching of the subject at Pitt.

But Pitt graduste students study-
ing sociobiology tend to disagree
with lNCAR’S assessment.

“We hope to make people aware
of sociobiology and what it is and to
prove to people that it‘s bunk,
unscientific and also dangerous,”
said INCAR member, Kathy Salak.

“INCAR is a mass multi-racial
group. that fights racism,"-Salak
explained. “We believe that racism
hurts both black and white people.
If ‘we're divided and we're fighting
each other , one race against
another, than we can't fight for for
the things that we all need. .

lt’s telling people that we are like this
becaiise it's in our genes , and there-
fore people should’ just accept the
inevitable wars or racism,” Salak
said. V ' _ '

' But Bebbie Sadler, a graduate stu-
dent of physical anthropology, said

-iN.CAR’s argument is “completely ,

wrong . Sociobiology”doesn’t say
wars are inevitable. Sociobiology
would say war is probably not adap-
tive. It simply doesn't occurt often
enough to be considered adaptive.
“Sociobiology presents hypo-
theses,” Sadler explained. “If a

behavior exists , it must be adaptive, ,
according to Darwin's natural selec-»

-tion. Otherwise, it wouldn't have
survived to this time period."

She added that “adaptive simply
means allowing the animal ti sur-
vive. It doesn't. make any moral
judgement on whether that's good or

 
 

' merit.

He estimated, that student negli-

percent" of the Hillman thefts and a
major portion of the reported cases

“When 1 first came onrboard I did‘

famphernallg prohibited as of 4”

By TOM SCHORR

A soon-to-be-enacted state law
banning the sale of drug parapher-
nalia has caused a ﬂurry ofbulk buy-
ing in the Pittsburgh area, according
to one area buisncssman whodeals
heavily in the merchandise.

“The biggest problem that l have
is keeping .the stuff in stock," said
Edward Abele, smoking department
manager of I the Heads Together

A Underground Mall in Squirrel Hill.

\

“People are coming in here and buy-
ing whole boxes of rolling papers.”
Abele attributes the skyrocketing

sales to the consumers fear that the .

law will totally cut supplies of the
paraphernalia.

The Heads Together Mall has
taken action to head off such a total
stoppage with a recent Federal suit
seeking a permanant injunction res-
training law enforcement officials
from enforcing the new prohibition.

“Rather than violate the law-we
are challenging it before it takes
effect,” Abele said. ‘‘If our case isn‘t
decided by the fourth, we'll ask for a"
temporary restraining order until
the case is decided. Then if we lose,
we'll appeal and ask for another
temporary order until the case is.
decided. I'm‘ hoping we'll win the
first round." _ ‘

Senate Bill 634 amended by the
House and signed it into law Dec. 4,
I980 by Gov. Thronburgh, outlaws

the sale or possesion of rolling pap-

ers, hash pipes, roach clips. balloons
and every other product "Designed
for use in planting ....concealing,‘
injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or oth-
erwise introducing into the human
bodyta controlled substance.”

The law which goes into effect

Feb. 4 is aimed at closing the doors’
‘of shops that sell equiptment and
fsupplies used to faciliatc the abuse

and sale of controlled substances.
The legitimate uses for other

prohibited products are not as

obvious. Cigarett papers labeled

Reefer Rollers and books detailing

the preperation and use of cocaine

f ‘Abele sounds optimistic about the

libutcome \of the hearing. Federal

 

R t  court decisions have gone in favor of
I_ head-shop owners in at least nine

‘cases in the recent past. Similar state

statutes have been struck down in
Indiana, Ohio, Florida, New York,
New Jersey and West Virginia. The
enjoyed statutes in these states are
almost identical to the Pennsylvania '
statute. this is because all the laws
are either identical copies or closely-
related variants, of the Model Drug
Paraphernalia Act drafted by the
Drug Enforcement Adninistration
of the United States Department of
Justice. n I

Sectionsof the east coast were virtually paralyzed
amid the nations most severe winter energy crisis.
Governor Milton Shapp ordered all Commonwealth
public and private schools closed for an indefinite
period of time to conserve the state’s dwindling heat-
ing fuel supplies. . V i A

A A biting wind, forcing sub zero temperatures. swept
across the Pitt campus where itremained “business as
usual” despite the crisis situation.

‘Crowds of students and faculty scurried across the
congested, snow-covered city streets on route to their l_
p.m. classes. ~

Suddenly, all activity came to a grinding halt—
traffic on Fifth Ave. stopped, as did a group of busi-
nessmen entering the University Club for lunch and
students making the treacherous hike up the hill to the 
chemistry building. '

It was on this day at this time that the history ofthe
University of Pjttsburgh was irreparably marred by
tragedy, when a rumbling blast ripped through and
leveled the Langley Hall Annex, killing two persons-
and injuring countless others. ,

Tomorrow marked the_fourth anniversary of the
Langley Hall tragedy. lt is not a date marked on my 6
calendar, as are the dates of ‘my parents" wedding
anniversary or my brother’s birthday dates that are
‘sometimes forgotten. ~

Each year, almost automatically, I am reminded of
the events of Jan. 20, along with the shock and disbe-
lief that rockedour campus four years ago.

Only minutes transpired that day before emergency
vehicles ca-me screeching from every directionto the
scene of the blast. Hordes of white clad doctors,
nurses, and interns from the University.Medical.Cen-~

“A few years ago, I began
making a transformation away from
the ﬁgurative," said artist Edward

Powell. “If you saw my lithographs
in the faculty art show, you
probably saw the female anatomy
in ways that were intentionally
sensual, not pornographic. I think
the works that you see here reﬂect
creation. They have a lot to do with
my moving into the country. I am
not totally in control; I am

participating in the materials to.

create an image.” Powell, whose
recent lithographs and paintings
are on display now through Feb. 1
at theUP Gallery (Forbes Ave. at
Bouauet Street). offered some

“All the work is about creation. I
tend to be a .Western Christian
when I think about creation. You
think of God, a force greater than
yourself, uttering but a word, and
then awesome oceans and deserts
lifting, heaving up. It's really
something to be a part of that
mystery of creating an image and
still ﬁnding it a mystery,” said

Powell. a ‘ ' .

He was viewing the lithograph
“A. Word/ Spoken.” The litho
lends itself to interpretation ‘by the
viewer of great movements by wind

much later than have many art
academicians in recent times. He
attended the Herron School of Art

in Indianapolis, receiving a bach-

then went on to pursue‘ a master's‘
of fine arts at Temple University’s
Tyler School of Art.

“I had a moderateinvolvemefit

of sports ﬁgures like a young

his work and his lifestyle. In my
early 20’s, I guess around 22, I
started taking a couple night
classes at the Herron School of Art.
The next term, I enrolled full-time,

and frozen dinners,’but very little
fresh meat or_ vegetables.
‘.‘It’s just too expensive to. eatthe
‘way we‘d like to,” said one. “We'd
like to buy some more meat, and
maybe some fresh, fruit, but _we'can’t
afford it.”
Do most college students worry
about good nutrition‘! ‘Are you kid-

eating habits were revolutionized by
fast food franchises,_24-hour con-

I To people weaned on soft drinks
and cheeseburgers, liver has an
unpleasant aftertaste. Good nutri-
tion means bland, natural foods like]

“kelp spread _on rye, celery juice and

their Whloppers with both hands
until their knuckles turn white. .. 

For manycollege students, good
nutrition is merely an afterthought.

time and money often inﬂuence

concern about a well-balanced diet.
And-as long as you feel okay and

“I’m very happy with my life, my
choice to live in a creative
environment like the kind I enjoy
here at Pitt,” Powell said with a
look of pride. “I’m very fortunate
to beat a university, to be in a
situation with so much support by
other people in the department. It
was like at the opening, I was able
to meet some people from othef

“The trend is so -common that
revisions upward may soon be made
in the« standardized height-weight
charts," said Dobrzynski. _

Thehbest way to ensure you" are
getting all the essential nutrients
‘daily is to eat the suggested amounts
of food from each of thelfour basic
food groups—meat and poultry,
fruits and vegetables, grains, and
dairy products. Vegetarians should
be sure to include the right mix of
proteinsources in their diet to meet
the daily requirement. Exercise is
recommended to complement any
regime of good nutrition. A

’ Followingthe guidelines "of good '
nutrition doesn't have to entail huge
sacriﬁces .or drastic changes in cat-
inghabits, provided you take care to
eat a variety of fojgds and practice
moderation. ' ‘ '

“Americans think it‘s hard to eat
well, but.it's not,“‘said Dobrzynski. '
“The problem is that we. often lack
the knowledge to make the right
choices for a balanced diet." -.

This lack of knowledge‘ is often

A responsible for“son'ie common mis-

‘conceptions about food. In some
cases, thetruth doesn‘t hurt. "-
Pizza, for example, is a good
source of nutrients, according to«Dr.
Barbara Deskins, assistant“profes-
sor of Clinical Dietetics and Nutri-
tion at the Pitt_School of Health
Related Professions.
“Pizzais good because it has‘

ingredients from all four ofthe basic ‘’

food groups."

You. may also be surprised to
learn that you don’t have to cut out
fast foods or those trips to the vend-

ing machines, as long as you don’t"

make it an obsession, said Deskins.

There are two things certain in everyone‘s life
acc_ording to a noted philosopher: death and taxes.

5 But in the case of Pitt, add a third: the annual appro-./

priations process. , _
And so, as kickoff time for the state budget is

' around the corner on Feb. 3, and State House and

Senate observers are predictingjust as many controv-
ersies over Gov. Thornburgh’s budget as last year, Pitt
can -expect much of the same political squabbling
which marred passage of appropriations funds and
almost caused a severe reduction in the amount of
funds which Pitt would have received for this year.
Last February, Gov. Thornburgh presented the
State Legislature with an unbalanced budget.
Although the budget appeared balanced on the sur-
face, it depended on 1) $26 million in revenues from a
i 10-cent bottle surcharge on liquor. 2) $15 million in
A revenues from fee increases, and 3) revenue sharing
continuing for the entire year. V
Let’s take a closer look at each of these revenue

sources, which are the main" source of funding for

non-preferred budget items such as appropriations to
state-related universities. ‘ —

pinion

 Taxes

   

     

First, the Liquor Control Board in January agreed
to a pricing plan which would have produced addi-
tional revenues for Pitt and other state-related in-
stitutions. But then, on July 23, the LCB rejected that
plan, making it temporarily impossible to appropriate
funds necessary to prevent severe cuts in appropria-
tions to such institutions as Pitt. Although it became
obvious in March that ‘this source of revenue was»
unlikely, Gov. Thornburgh never modified his budget
request to recognize this fact. 1

Second, the administrative fee increases proposed

to raise $15 million from “miscellaneous sources” was _
not the firsttime that this item appeared in the Gover-

'nor’s budget. In 1979, Gov. Thornburgh proposed to
raise_t_he same $15.mi1lion, but he never sent a bill to
the legislature to do so. And so, when questioned as to
his intentions last February," he promised a fee ‘bill
would be sent to the legislature within a few weeks. No

/such bill arrived until June. The bill that did arrive"
contained no set amounts for fees, but instead'pro- '

posed that the legislature forfeit its right to set fees and
allow the administration to set all fees through regula-
tions. This approach was soundly defeated with less
than half the elected Republicans supporting it. It

-received no Democratic support.

After that first bill, there were several attempts to
achieve a compromise to permit .a fee bill to pass. V
Prior to adjournment for the summer, Senate Bill 1299
was debated. This bill would have raised $7 million in
fees. Gov. Thornburgh _ publicly announced that,

appropriations. The bill failed, and he vetoed and
abated the non-preferred appropriations by $34.8
million. ” '

Third, federal revenue sharing terminated as,.of,

October 1980, butithe Governor’s budget anticipated

revenues from this source for a full year. Thediffer-.

ence was $57 million. When confronted with this
shortfall in revenues, Gov. Thornburgh responded
that he would not modify hisbudget at that point, but
instead would face the problem when it occurred. in

’ October. ‘
“So much for responsible budgeting,”. wrote Rep. 1

Max Pievsky, Chairman of the House Committee on
Appropriations in a July 24 letter to The Pitt News.
So much for responsible budgeting? ln that case, so

‘s _ _ . ,
much for responsible governance because this year

looksjust as bad, considering revenues forthe 1981-82
General‘Funds budget will be just sufficient to cover
‘those expenses, excluding what’s left over for the non-
preferred items. ' -
Skyrocketing inflation, cutbacks in federal revenue-

sharing funds for the new fiscaleyear, andﬁan approxi-
mate $100 million shortfall in projected revenues for \
PennDot will all combine to create another political '

budgetary circus similar to last year’s.

And so, as stated at- the introduction to this editor-
ial, some things are certain in everybody’s life. But for
Pitt, the annual appropriations process-is unique, not
for its singularity,’ butfor the certainty of partisan,
special-interest factors which go into ' the final.
outcome. ‘ i , ~

These clauses or similar ‘clauses

, are found in some standard leases

used by landlords in Pittsburgh. All
of the above .material is not legally
binding, but is used often to i'ri-timi'-
date and/ or deceive tenants. Not all

‘ landlords do this; but there is a sum-

cient number to warrant mention of

these practices. When’ you are about -

to sign a lease and find that you
don’t agree with or understand any
‘clause, ask the landlord about that-

particular one. If the landlord"

informs you that the clause-is mean-
ingless, have him scratch it out ofthe

'- lease. If there is anything you are

unsure about, don’t_ sign imme-.

Healﬂiline ——ToxicShocl(SyIIhlie: Expertslhspmd'l'o Questions  

“Healthline” is part of the I 981
Student Health Advisory Board's
campaign to increase the “Health
I.Q. ” among students. lt’s our goal

to stimulate and strengthen your J

knowledge of health issues (facts)
and the many alternatives to health
care delivery. We invite any persons
with healthful interests to join the

Board and to use the Student Health -

Service as an information center.
Beginning this week, the staff
from the Student Health Service will
answer some of the most commonly
asked health—related questions from
Pitt Students. Anyone with a ques-
tion can deposit the inquiry in the
COMPLAINT BOX in the waiting
room ofthe Student Health Service,
204 Brackenrige Hall," or slip it

under the door of the Student
Health Advisory Boards office
located at 3l5 Student Union.
TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
We have received many inquiries
about Toxic Shock Syndrome from
understandbly concerned stu-
dents.The following questions and
answers are intended to explain
what is known about the disease as
well as to give you the Student
Health Service recommendations
with regard to tampon use.
Q. _What is Toxic Shock Syndrome?
A. Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is‘
a severe illness with symptomsof a
high fever (l02—l04), vomiting.
diarrhea and muscular aching, fol-
lowed by a decrease in blood pressu-

re . and. in severe cases. shock. A
“sunburn-like“ rash is present dur-
ing the acute phase ofthe illness; and
about l0 days after onset. there may
be peelings of the skin, particularly
of the palms of the hands and soles
of the feet.

’ Q. How frequently does it occurr‘?

A. From January to September
l980, 299 cases had been reported to
the Center for Disease Control
(CDC); 285 of these cases were in
women; there were 25 deaths.

Q. What causes TSS?

A. Studies conducted by the CDC
have firmly established the roles of
both tampons and the bacteria Sta-
phylococcus aureus as causative fac-

tors of TSS in menstrauting women.
There has been an increased inci-
dence of the disease in women who
used the Rely tampon.

Q. What tampons were studied?
A. The study showed 7l percent of
the women who had the disease used
the Rely tampon. Of the remaining
victims included in the study, l9
percent used the Playtex brand, 5

percent used Tampax. 2 percent‘

used Kotex and 2 percent used OB.

Q. Are the tampons “con-
taminated”? .

A. No. Unused tampons weretested
and found to be sanitary. Studies to

date suggest that tampons are a con-. ' ‘
tributing factor, perhaps by carrying -

bacteria from the hands to the Vag-

ina during the process of insertion, A - A 
by providing a favorable environ‘-”-""
ment for the growth ofthe organism,  ~
or by rubbing or scratchingthe walls  
of the vagina so infection may i

OCCUIT.

Q. What should a woman do if she _ 

thinks she has TSS?

A. lfa woman chooses to use tam- A‘
pons and develops a high fever and A,

vomiting or diarrhea during » her" _‘ ..
menstrual period. she should dis- ‘
continue tampon use and consult at C.

physician immediately.-

Where on Earth...?

don’t' even wrap loaves of breadin plastic--just carry
them bare. Notebookpaper is lined both ways like
graph paper. Grown men in business suits ride little
motor bikes to work. Everybody takes two hours in
the middle of the day for lunch--which isn’t until two
o’clock in the afternoon. Even the grocery stores close
up then. The toilet tank is eight feet up the bathroom
wall with a chain hanging down. People don’t wear

instead of Saturdays. The man with the ice cream cart
sings along with the opera on the radio. Breakfast is
nothing but bread and coffee--and the coffee is half
warm milk. Where in the world am I???

, In each case you could be'in any one ofa number of
countries on a study-abroad program, and you may be
discovering suddenly that all the little details of every-
day life--and all the big details of language and
government-—are not like things back home.

usual, but there’s so much more. its true that visiti_ng
and living awhile in another country has a special
advantage foristudents of the language spoken there,
but for any student in any field, an international expe-
rience offers a kind of learning that can never be
gained in a classroom at home...Everything around you
is a learning experience. The way people dress and eat
and respond to the daily news, the way they spend their
leisure, ’ the way they regard their families are all

. instructive to the serious traveler.

Living in another country provides an exposure to

. taken for granted. A person who has a firsthand expe-
- rience of other ways of being human can make com-

parisons and informed decisions about his‘/ her own.

Dear Colleagues: _ ~

As you know, the recent earth-
quake in"sou_thern Italy has created
untold "misery still largely unalie-
viated. A few days ago I received a
letter from Profdessor Alberto
Monroy, a world famous biologist
and director of the leading biologi-
cal research institute in Italy.

The letter is a request for con-

. Reader Spedis 

Dear Editor, ,
I could not believe the irresponsi-
bility of The Pitt News Editorial
Board for op’enly condoning non-
registration efforts in its “Opinion”
on Friday, Jan. 9, l98l. To argue
against the issue ofdraft registration
is one thing. but to openly support
the illegal actions of certain individ-
uals isat the very least a highly ques-
tionable act as a representative of
the University of Pittsburgh andpits
student body. ~
- ‘Before you start mumbling,'“Here
goes anotherpnaive, blind-following
conservative.”l ask you to continue
reading and "consider an argument
that suprisingly few seem to have the
foresight to voice. ln your superfi-
cial analysis of both sides‘ rhetoric.
the logical argument underlying the
issue has been buried in an emo-

tional blizzard.

naive to assume that the conditions
that led to those crises could never
occur again. ln fact, we are in a
period where the world political and
economic issues, which greatly
affect our daily lives, are in a con-
stant flux. Global frictions and great

“uncertainty are generated by this
/' flux and it remindsethose of us with a
historical

perspective that great
potential dangers lie ahead for those
who do not act now with foresight.

Never in recent decades "has the
United States been less prepared to
defend itself. A peacetime force of
volunteers has left all four military
services severely undermanned and
also undertrained. ln the event of
attack our present forces would be
grossly insufficient to defend the
sources of our daily su_stenance._We

Pitt Offense Sparkles In, 5
86-48 Thrashing of State  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The Panthers were just having
somefun. Gone was the nervous-
ness, the timidity that marked the
loss to Rutgers. The shooting
slump was also gone as the
Panthers were scoring off the
fastbreak, off the set offense, even
the 14th man got into the act.

Hands were slapped, smiles were '

wide, and a standout freshman may
well have found his game again.

# Designated league game

The way that basketball should
be played and that the Panthers
can play was on display Saturday
night at the Field House before
2,852 fans, The only problem was
that the reason the Panthers looked
good was the opponent.
Delaware State proved to (be no
more proﬁcient at basketball than it
was at football, where they lost
105-0 to Portland State, as it got
demolished by the Panthers 86-48.

From the outset there really was
no doubt who the better team was
as Pitt raced to an incredible 34-6
lead.

Among the scorers were Carlton
Neverson, who ehded up with 13
points, and Dwayne Wallace. In the
first half alone, Pitt had 14 lavups,‘

Pantherette Swimmers Demolish Penn State

By SEAN BARNES

The Pantherette swimmers
defeated the Penn State Nittany
Lion team by a resounding score of
111-29 Saturday at Trees Pool.
Coach Dick Bradshaw’s squad
exhibited a team effort that left 14
of the 16 girls who swam with
Eastern qualifying times in every
event they swam. As if this wasn’t
enough, the Pantherettes had three
events qualify for Nationals.

The ﬁrst National qualifying time
came in the first event, the
200-meter medley relay, with a
time of 1:49.46. Swimming for Pitt
"were Sue I-Iieon, Diana Firth, Nancy
Henry, and Jan Ujevich. A '

y The fourth‘ event of the meet

‘In doing his

a sure sign of Delaware"State’s
ineptness.

, By the half, the score was_ 36-13
with Pitt comfortably in front. The
Hornets shot a miserable 23
percent from the field and even
basic techniques such as a bounce
pass was an adventure. Indeed,
this was fun as Carlton Neverson

- put it.
“We were, confident out there

and we worked hard. Of course, it’s V

always fun when you win,” said
Neverson.

The second half proved no

different as Pitt quickly upped its -

lead to 50-16 behind Lennie
McMi1lan’s and Sam Clancy’s
shooting. Indeed, the issue at hand
was not who was going to win the
game, that had been decided,_but
when would the reserves get in.
Chipman wasted no time, as he
slowly worked his troops around

' until eventually the second teamers

and third teamers were out there.
bench clearing,
Chipman might have found the
scorer he had been looking for.

Ever since he scored 29 points
against James Madison, Clyde
Vaughn has not -been the same
player. His playing time was
severely cut and his confidence
seemed shot. A shooting slump -did
not help much and it looked as if
the freshman,-who had impressed
everyone early, was slowly fizzing
away. Or so it seemed.

After having gone 0-5 in the first
half, including a missed dunk,
Vaughn , played like a man

_possessed in the second half and

made everyone remember why
Clyde Vaughn was brought here in
the first place. In the ﬁnal 12
minutes, Vaughn found the shoot-
ing touch that made him the New

York state scoring champ and hit a _

sizzling seven-for-1'1 fromthe field,
including a dunk that atoned for his
previous missed one.

With 3:18 to go, Vaughn stole a
pass at midcourt and headed for
the basket. He could have passed
off to a teamate who was closer to
the goal, but Vaughn had one thing

in mind. He dribbled until he was -

about six feet from the basket
where he then tucked the ball in his
forearem and winkdmilled it into
the basketfor a crowd pleasing
dunk. His performance, a

brought Pitt" another
qualifying time. Winning the 100
meter freestyle was Ujevich, with a
time of 51.98.

The next-to-last event brought
Pitt its third National qualifying
time and its second of the day for
Firth, who won the 100 meter
breast stroke. Firth’s time of
1:07.47 was ‘better than that of the
second-place finisher._

Pitt divers did their share as
Julie DeHaven made National
pre-qualifications by over 17 points
,with her three-meter total of
257.32.

Overall, it was _a devastating
meet for the ___Lions. as p the

game-high 20 points and 11
rebounds, was due to one thing
according to the freshman.
“Conﬁdence,” said Vaughn
That’s what it was. I went out
there and played well;
confidence back.”
Vaughn’s performance had to
bring a smile to Roy Chipman’s

_ face. He had the scorer he needed

except the 50-meter back stroke,
which was decided by one-
hundredth of a second. '

“This was the best team effort
this season,” said Bradshaw.
“They were good - they’re ranked
third in the East - but our strong

2 team effort gave us first and second

in most of the events. We are right
on course for Easterns.”

“We played very well. Weput
some things together,” said Chip-
man”. Clyde looked very confident
out there, as did the whole squad.

‘and we’re slowly getting better.”

Also very pleased was Pitt diving if

coach Julian Krug. Whose girls

and took first and second on the
three-meter board. Krug said his
girls‘ had been working hard and

Strange happenings occurred this

Looking onto the ice, one was
able to notice that only one referee
arrived to officiate. Then to the
amazement of this Pitt News repor-

only 40 fans, the players stood while
the sound system played a silent
rendition of the national anthem.

‘ This being a home game for Pitt, it
seemed as though a day of bad luck

This, fortunately, was not to be the

One major problem that they have

coach. Because this happened, Jifn

coaching duties for this particular

game. .

‘Pitt’ started out by showing their
finesse on skates. With only a few

two goals were scored, oneby Dan

The Pantherettes continued their
dominance over West Virginia,
defeating'the Lady Mountaineers
78-67 Wednesday night-in Morgan-

9 town. The win upped Pitt’s record

to I2-3 and extended their winning
streak to seven games.

Coach Judy Saurer’s squad
moved to a 42-34 halftime lead,
primarily on the strength of its
shooting. The Pantherettes outshot
West.X/irginia for the floor, I8-l 5, in
the. first 20 minutes. Leading the
way was point guard Debbie Lewis,
penetrating the defense for what

usually resulted in a layup or an
assist.

While the offense was slicing West
Virginia’s defense, the defense was
struggling to shut off Lady Moun-
taineer J. D. Drummonds. Drum-
monds kept the Lady Mountaineers

. in the game by pumping in 30 points,

28 ofthem by field goals. Teammate
Cathy Parson helped Drummond
out with IS tallies.

“Our plan was to try and get WVU
to substitute for Parsons,“explained
Saurer. “That would leave just

Drummonds to concentrate on, plus

Gone are the Delaware States
and Eastern Kentuckys. What lies
ahead will make or break the Pitt
Panthers. In the next two weeks,
Pitt will face Rhode Island and
George Washington on the road
before coming nome to face Albert
King and the rest of nationally-
ranked Maryland, then go right
back on the road to face Eastern
Eight leader WVU in Morgantown.

It all begins Tuesday night
against a tough Rhode Island team.

By SEAN BARNES

“What a comeback,” said Fred
Lewis, Pitt men’s swimming coach,
as Pitt rebounded from behind to
defeat a fast Penn State team
59-54. In a meet that was decided
by_ the last event, the Panthers

‘rallied their strength to win the

ﬁnal 400-meter free relay with a
3:10.18. This was the second
Panther win in two days; the team
scored a 64-42 over Duquesne
Friday. ,
Pitt had to rely on its depth and

she would have more pressure on her
to score."
The plan worked on some occa-

sions, but the sharp—shooting Drum- .

monds still led West» Virginia to a
slight l6-l4 edge in field goals in the
second half. As in the past, the foul
shooting {at the Pantherettes was a
key to the game. Pitt hit on l4 of l6
freebies, a hot 87.5 percent from the
sin stripe. Meanwhile, the Lady
Mountaineers had only l0 opportu--
nities at the free throw line, cashing
in on only five of them.

Debbie Lewis led the Pantherettes
with 20 points. Pam Miklasevich
added l6, as did Gail Aughburns
and Penny Welsh. Aughburns
hauled down l2 rebounds, and
Welsh grabbed ll ofthe boards for
Pitt.

Pitt Bits: The Pantherettes defeated
Northwestern Saturday night 76-74.
Lewis and Welsh led the way with 2|
points each . . . Again nine players
dented the scorebook for Pitt in the
game with WVU as Saurer is trying
to rest her starters for the long road
trip . . . There is some discrepency as
to the validity of the games against
the Polish National squad. If it is
decided not to include those games
in the record, Pitt will be l3-2.

Eight, the Rams have had a
successful season with a 10-3
record including a victory over
DePaul conqueror Old Dominion on

‘Saturday. Their losses were to
number one Oregon State by a
whopping score of 103-55 and to
Drake and once-‘beaten Con-
necticut.

Already a ﬁckle team with great
performances followed by hor- I
rendous ones, the Panthers must
put together a string? of good
shooting games if they are to be a
factor in the Eastern Eight. And it
all must start on Tuesday night.

strength to beat a well prepared
Penn State team. Lewis’ lineup for
the meet had Sandy Pidgeon out of

his two strongest events, breast‘

stroke and IM, and put him in the
winning medley relay and a very
close 500-meter free race.

Outstanding for Pitt was free-
styler Rick Carter who anchored
the winning medley relay, won the

Island Tuesday

Rhode Island is coming off ’
victories over‘- South Carolina and
Old Dominion. They, too, appear
to be peaking. Theypare led by
three players, all averaging in
double ﬁgures. ‘Wright, Owens
and Upshaw, the two forwards and
guard are averaging 15.1, 13.3 and
12.5 points a game, respectively.’

The Panthers are,as usual, being
led by Sam Clancy, Carlton‘
Neverson and Clyde Vaughn.
Vaughn’s 20 points on Saturday‘
may make Roy Chipman use the
freshman as early as possible and
especially if his team loses its

respectively on the one-meter
board. Greenwelf also ﬁnished
second in the three-meter board.
while Minik placed third.

This was Minik’s ﬁrst real meet
in over a year, and Pitt diving coach
Julian Krug was pleased with
Minik’s showing’ for Pitt. Minik

himself, however, was notsatisﬁed .

with his ‘three-meter score and
expects better of himself at the
next meet. '

“Our three-meter showing was not
‘ up to par and theirs was, ~ plus

this is a must game. Both are 3-1 in
the Eastern Eight and a loss would

league pace-setter WVU. For the
Panthers, a win would come only if
their shooting is on. Against a
team of the’ caliber. of the Rams, a
loss of range would /certainly spell’
defeat for Pitt.

Saturday's easy win, “The season

side the wreckage as fireman, paramedics, and volun-
teers from a local construction site sifted through the
rubble in search of victims—a search many feared
might yield the body ofan unaccounted for roommate,
boyfriend or, as in my case, a friend from home.

5 ,iOffto the side ofthe crowd a middle-aged man clad
in a dark suit finished an interview with a local televi-
sion reporter. As he finished the interview, he stared at
the wreckage, his face displaying the horror that was
so prevalent that day. This man was Wesley Posvar,

 

was one of the great growing experiences of my years
at Pitt. '

I might feel compelled to convey to our readers
some -Divine journalistic message, urging all to live
each day to the fullest, “to turn the other cheek,”and
to appreciate friends and family while fate permits
them to be in our presence. But I won’t deliver preach-
ings that I, myself, do not abide my.

Although my idealistic side would like to adhere to
   a

 

 

continued from pazefour

‘these preachings, I continue to complain about the

course of my life, am intolerant ofthe shortcomings of
others, and partake in the “people games” we are guilty?“
of playing. from time to time. "

I will instead conclude, leaving this column as it was
originally intended...a remembrance ofthat tragic day
four years ago, a tribute to those who lost their lives,
and a reminder to those of us who were spared.

- _/ "2" ' ~. /’ .1

  

 

Chancellor of the University. Posvar stood alongside
the students that day, sharing their grief, questioning
why fate had chosen to play such dirty games with
their young lives, lives that had only just begun.

Back in the dorms, groups of_students huddled

around small television sets, awaiting word on the
jsituation. These were the same students who just
weeks before joyously celebrated the victory of their
number one football team in the Sugar Bowl.
Thoughts of New Orleans’ Bourbon Street and the
Superdome were nowhere to be found. There was no
cheering and no laughing anywhere on campus.

These students, members of what critics termed the '
“me generation” answered pleas for donors from the
Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh in such‘ great
numbers that many had to be turned away. They
sought to disprove the stereotypic tag attached to their
generation, wanting desperately to give ofthemselves
so that classmates they did not even know might live.
On a campus of 30,000 strangers, there was a sense of
cohesiveness, each one giving for the other.

The investigations into the blast that claimed the
lives of a young girl who wanted to be a teacher and a
university secretary have been closed, with a natural
gas leak beneath the streets of Oakland being listed as
the cause. For the most part, the physical wounds
have healed, but, for those who experienced the sights
and sounds of Jan. 20, I977, and for those who lost
friends and family, the memories of that day will be
indelibly etched in their minds to be relived again and
again.

Sitting here at my typewriter I find myself in the
rather precarious position of being a writer with
nothing to say. There is no editorial comment to be
made when speaking ofthe Langley Hall explosion. I *
can say that the ordeal ofliving through such a tragedy

PRINTING vs.PAINTIN G

If Powell had to make a choice
between painting and printmaking,
he said he would choose" printmak-
ing. He views painting as a freer

form of expression than printmak-‘A

ing. ,

“I can’t articulate it like a
physicist, but I like the process of
making lithographs. There’s just
something about that ﬁneness,
working with a piece of paper
carefully. There’s apreciousness of
prints and after handrolling the
stone the image is on for a while, it
eventually gets in your blood. With
painting you can change colors
quickly, easily, but prints require a
different approach, it’s more set or
ﬁxed in stages.”

EXPERIENCING NATURE,
TOUCHING LIVES

“I feel sorry for the artist who is
‘not involved with a school or
university,” Powell ‘said. “He is
sheltered or isolated from a very
supportive environment. Of
course, what I’ve found to work for
me may not apply to everyone,”
said Powell. “But for me, the

support has been yery important" to i I
my progress. 'It’s just good to be in

an atmosphere that is not so
secretive and full of jealousy.”
Looking around the UP Gallery,
walking around as if seeing the
works for the first time, Powell
came to a pensive conclusion.
“What I want from my life, what

A I hope for through my work, is that

someday I will touch somebody’s
life. To move them and have them
see life, the movement of it on a
small scale and feel the intensity,
the power of the wind, the sand,
and the water and other elements
for their true and awesome value.

If only one person can experience
that awe, I think I have
accomplished a great deal,” said
Powell, his eyes probing, digging

.into the “Wind, Sand, Water”
