ltseems like an afterthought, doesn’t it?

Thursday’s groundbreaking for the John M.
and Gertrud‘e*‘E.‘ Petersen Events Center was a
strictly ceremonial event, since the actual work
onthe project beganwith the demolition of Pitt

Stadium that started in December.

However that didn’t stop the University from

pulling out all the stops for the event, including
appearances by Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
Pittsburgh .Mayor Tom Murphy, lAthle"ti'cs
Dire.ctor Steve Pederson, and of course, the
Petersens themselves.

As the sounds of Peabo Bryson and Regina
Belle’s “A Whole New World” filled the air, the
chancellor walked up to the podium to begin the
event ,

“This is a historic day for the University of
Pittsburgh,” Nordenberg said. “This convocation

With comfortable plush red
chairs, freshly painted tan walls,
pine—finished railings, and air con-
ditioning that can keep even the
most feverish audience at a cool 60
degrees, the new Henry Heymann
Theatre promises to help revitalize
the arts at Pitt and bring in revenue
from the growing Pittsburgh -theater
community.

“It’s a beautiful space,” said Pitt
alumna Elena Passarello of the new
Henry Heymann Theatre, located on
the lower level of the Stephen

Foster Memorial. The new theater,
costing just more than half a million
dollars, boasts the only 150, seat
ful1—thrust stage in the Pittsburgh
area. The stage juts into the audi-
ence’s seating.

‘The Heymann was born from
the death of another Pitt theater last
summer. Last July, The Pit Theatre,
located on Bouquet Street was torn
down to make way for the new
multi-purpose academic center —— a

project which had been on the

University’s wish list for years.

Without The Pit, students and

artists throughout Pittsburgh would
be without a stage for theirpacting
classes, improvisation nights and

full-scale productions  Eortunatel‘yi
for them, the ‘foresight--of theater»

chair Attilio Favorinni and a plan to
build a new theater was already
underway.

Favorinni rallied the support of
retired theater professor and per-

sonal friend, Henry Heymann.

Heymann, who taught and creat-
ed sets at Pitt for 25 years, has

designed sets for venues like Heinz *
Hall and the New York City Opera.» ‘

Heymann agreed to help -fund the
project only if the University would
contribute as well.

Pitt C Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg and John Cooper, dean
of arts and sciences, were “one hun-

. \ \ ~ ~ « \ t - ~ - . . \ ~ \

dred percent supportive of the pro-
ject,” Favorinni said. “'[Within 14
months, the theater] went from con-
ception to construction to opening.”

Favorinni has high hopes for the
new theater as well as Pitt’s theater
department. He is optimistic about
“opening our theaters to the world.
Renting out spaces. Creating situa-
tions in which our students can
interact with professionals. Serving
the western Pennsylvania communi-
ty with our facilities and our pro-
gramming.”

Staff Writer

Nigerian-born Nkaiso rAkpabio’s
name translates aptly to “proceed
forward with strength.”

“When I’m in class and the
teacher addresses an issue that deals

with African Americans, they seem ,

to look to me to answer the question
or single me out inclass where I am
the only black student,” Akpabio
said.

Managing a demanding schedule
at -the University ‘of Pittsburgh as an
English writing and history major,
with "a minor in African studies,
Akpabio applies his strengths and
talents to his poetry, art and the many

organizations that he is involved in.

Although he is barely 20 years
old, this Pitt sophomore has begun to
show signs of a true leader. V

Akpabio, vice-chieftan of Yotep,
uses the organization as a forum to
reach black students on campus
through poetry, music and art. ,

Yotep, derived fromithe words
“yo,” meaning “what’s up,” and

_?.‘hotep,” the Kiswihili word for

“peace,” is an organization that rep-
resents the hip—hop culture. .
Although Yotep is not part of the
Black Action Society, the two groups
are similar in their causes. Akpabio
describes them as being separate but
equal. Yotep tries to cover the social,
economic and political concerns of
blacks on campus and abroad.
Akpabio is alsoiinvolved in the-
new1y—formed FREEDOM Project,
which stands :for A Fundamental
Resources for the Education and

‘ Enrichment and Development for the

black Majority. This organization is

and lighting design professor. Fox
modeled the space with the theater
department’s philosophy in mind —
creating a theater which would
attract professional actors and per-
formance groups for collaboration
with theater students.

Some of the Heymann’s ameni-
ties for actors include spacious
dressing rooms, a bathroom and
shower, and a stage surface called a
“sprung floor” which is built over a
layer of sand, making for a smooth
comfortable surface, ideal in per-

makes it easy for anyone to attend a
performance. . -

Jason Kozlowski, who is in
charge of theater public relations,
said the Heymann already attracts

a attention.

“We’re already getting calls
from arts organizations requesting
the space for use,” he said. _

‘ One group, Promethea ‘Theatre,
has rented out the space this sum-
mer for a production of “The Heidi
Chronicles,” in which several Pitt
students, as well as other local tal-
ents, will be featured. ‘ .

Heymann designed the set for
the new theater’s opening show,
“Ferris Wheel,” which was written

 Crews hpulthe final touches on Pill's new Heymann Theater

by local, award-winning playwright
Janyce Lapore.

The outside collaboration
brought by Starlight Productions
enabled students Passarello_ and
Mary Kate Urbanski the» opportuni-
ty to work and learn on a profes-
sional level.

“That’s probably, the biggest
benefit of this experience,” said
Passarello of working with career
actresses like Robin Walsh, who has
appeared in the soapopera “The
Young and the Restless.” _

This season, adaptations of
American novels will be appearing
as “mainstage” productions" at the
Heymann. “Turn of the Screw” by
Henry James and “Silent Spring,”

.put into play form by theater arts

faculty Favorinni and Lynne
Conner will be featured.

In an effort to maintain bonds
within the greater community, Jed
Harris, a professor from CMU, has
been invited to direct Pitt students
in a play adaptation of Philip K.
D.ick’_s “Flow My Tears, a
Policeman Said.” "

By the end of the 2001 school
year," the Foster Theater upstairs

’ will be prepared. _to re—open along-

“[Then it will be] a true per-

Nordenbergthen gave way to
Pederson, who noted that the con-

FROM PAGE 1

struction was still going on as the

ceremony was taking place.

“When you’vewaited for some-
thing since 1972, you take the
stance that when they start, you

’ don’t let them stop,” Pederson said.

The chancellor then praised the
contributions of both the city and
state governments. He said that
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge
played a key role in the funding of

e the convocation center.

“Without Governor Ridge’s sup-
port, we wouldn’t be here today,”
Nordenberg said. “A lesser person
might have taken the easy way out,
but he stepped up and came through
for the University.”

. As for Murphy, Nordenberg said
that the mayor helped Pitt live up to
the motto, “The city is our campus.”

Murphy concurred, stating the
importance of the students to the
continued renaissance of the city.

“Students are the economic
incubators of Pittsburgh,-” ‘ Murphy
said. “It takes leaders with vision to
encourage those students, and that’s

A . what Pitt has.”

After the leaders finished their
remarks, they proceeded to the front
of the temporary stage that had been
set up, where shovelswere stuck in
the ground, waiting for the first
patch of dirt to be turned over."

Then, — Pederson turned. to
Ricardo Greer and Brooke Stewart,
members of Pitt’s men’s and
women’s basketball teams, respec-
tively, to unveil a new sign that will

remain at the construction site
throughout the building of the con-
vocation center.

With cameras ﬂashing, the offi-
cial groundbreaking then took
place, leading to the playing of Kool
and the ,Gang’s “Celebration,” as
confetti was shot into the air.

The l2,500—seat arena will be
the main centerpiece of the area that
was formerly occupied by Pitt
Stadium. The remainder of the land
will be occupied by new student
housing facilities, and, as
Nordenberg put it, “that much need-
ed green space that we’ve always
wanted.”

The Petersen Center will have
four luxury courtside suites, 48
courtside seats, 12 luxury club level
seats, a club lounge and 2000 pri-
vate club seats.

There will also be an extensive
student recreation’ center" in the
complex, as well as the Willis
Center for Academics for Student
Athletes.

The athletic. department’s
administrative offices will also be
located at the Petersen Center, along
with a food service facility, a retail
store and a full-service ticket opera-
tions center.

, The project was funded with $38 .
million from the Commonwealth of
' Pennsylvania, along with the $10

million gift from the Petersens. John
Petersen graduated from Pitt in
1951 -and is the retired president and
chief executive officer of the Erie
Insurance Group. ‘

The architects for the project are
Apostolou Associates of Pittsburgh
and Rosser International of Atlanta.
The Petersen Center is slated to
open in late—200l or early-2002.

Jason Rogers, Akpabio’s friend and

fellow Yotep member. “He has a

Akpabio was actually raised in

It was at home that Akpabio

credits his mother with his -strength’,
kindness and even his knowledge of
women.

“She is everything to me,” he

said with a broad smile. “She is my

He also took direction from the

“Although I am not a Christian

anymore,” Akpabio said. “I have a,

different understanding of religion
now. I believe his lessons were uni-
versal. ....I learned that man must fol-
low his own path.” -

Akpabio cites Bob Marley as a
strong inﬂuence.

‘_‘He taught me the meaning of
freedom that allows me to keep my
mind straight and‘. keep my mind
open,” he said.

stuff that world views are made
of, and when people of different
faiths debate, their arguments

often rest on incompatible value
, systems.

Cue the secul_ar state, which
must negotiate between the
faiths and ensure that no one is
marginalized. The Supreme
Court recently ruled that a Texas
public school district could no

, longer sponsor prayer on public

property. Two Texas families
challenged the ban, claiming that
school-organized prayer before-
football games- was a statewide
tradition.

But not all-religions pre-
scribe prayer, and -someone —
maybe a lot of someones —— is
bound to feel excluded. The pub-
lic school is a secular institution,
impartial to religious belief. If
you encourage one typeyof ritual
'——— in this case, prayer —- where
do you draw the line? Spiritual
dances? Sacrifices?

Yet the ruling shouldn’t'
exclude people, either. Private
prayer is perfectly legal in this
country, no matter what your
denomination. Pray in your place
of worship. Pray on the street or

on the bus. Pray in the cafeteria,

if you have to’, during school’

hours. And sure, pray for the
home team, even without a stu-
dent to lead. '
Moreover, educators should
be ﬂexible enough to help stu-
dents feel comfortable about
their beliefs, even if the support
isn’t ‘officially implemented.

a Islam requires followers to pray

five times a day. Is it really so
terrible to let Muslim students
take a few minutes in the after-
noon to bow toward the East?
There’s -no reason why a Hindu
student can’t carry a copy of
“Upanishad” into math class,
just_ as long as the school doesn’t
make everyone do so. ~
‘Many critics have recom-
mended a moment of silent
reﬂection in place of school
prayer. This is a deliberately
vague suggestion, but the idea is
sound: Give people a minute to
think, pray, meditate, twiddle
their thumbs, just as long as it
doesn’t have a sectarian label. Is

there merit to this proposal? Will ,

it allow us to reassess all com-
mon school practices, such as the
Pledge of Allegiance? Is a mid-
dle ground possible? . '

- It’s worth a minute of reﬂec-
tion, anyway.

. Man, it’s hot! I was in the Southwest
around this time last year, and we could
teach them a thing about heat. Here in
the ‘Burgh the sun bursts through the
clouds’ without mercy. It comes down
uponour heads, frying away what brains
are left after finals. 7

' Of course we have global warming
after a hundred years of steel mills
pumping smoke. And now there’s no
smog t:o’break up the sun’s rays because
all the steel mills have been torn down.
Combine these with another 20 years of
hair spray use and we are doomed.-

Back in winter, when the -slush was

CARL

knee-deep and soaking ‘the
bells of everyone’s retro pants,
I remember the pleadings of
the masses. The cries for some
sunshine and warmth are now
being answered. These same
masses are now complaining that it is

 

1 too hot and saying that ‘winter really

isn’t all that bad.

I hope these people didn’t come to
Pittsburgh for the weather. While we
might be an up—and—coming culture spot
like Cleveland (Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame and Museum), Florence (the
Uffizi) or Paris (the Louvre), yinz know
we ain’t no Los Angeles. ‘

, Two of the only ways to have fun in
Pittsburgh is to either enjoy the heat or
beat it. If you’re one of the crazy people
taking classes in the Cathedral this sum-
mer (like me), enjoy the body odor that
grows stronger as the three-hour class
drags on. When‘you getout of that class
and you smell like nature, join it! Take a
walk through Schénley Park and enjoy
the shade of the trees and the frolicking
of the chipmunks. Another great idea is
Phipps Conservatory. The humidity is so
high in there, when you come out, you’ll
think Pittsburgh has transformed itself

‘ into a cool desert isle. You then can dip
your toes inthe Cathedral fountain and
pretend the ocean is lapping at your feet.

There are also ways to actually
escape the heat: go to the Carnegie
Museum. You get a student discount, it
is air-conditioned and there is even a
cafeteria in the basement if you aren’t

' into looking at all that art stuff.

Other great air-conditioned spots are

the movie theaters in Squirrel Hill. If -

you go to a matinee, they usually don’t
have the air conditioner pumped up full
blast until halfway through the movie.
After the movie is over you can com-
plain to the manager that the air temper-
ature wasn’t to your satisfaction, and

they’ll usually give you a complimenta-

ry ticket. Then you can pass
another two hours in the cool
darkness, which by, now is
overly air-conditioned. And
the cycle may continue. You
can complain again that the
theater is now too cold and take your
chances getting another ticket or getting-
kicked out. But don’t worry, there is
another theater down the street. Please,
don’t tell anyone you read that here.
Lastly, there is my favorite air-con-
ditioned spot, the library. It is said that
Hillman Library is the hottest spot on
campus during finals week. Why could-
n’t it be all year round? There is no
longer a beverage ban (spill—proof con-
tainers, please). Now all we need is a
DJ . ’
With that last pitch for the library, I
hope I have inspired many to find new
ways of enjoying the heat or staying
cool this summer. Look for me at the
video store; I’ll be the poor college stu-
dent camped out in the action/adventure
aisle. Watching a video for two hours in
an air-conditioned store .is better than
watching it in my sweltering jungle

“apartment. And there are no rental fees

involved!

Carl Schneider is on the lookout for a
talented library DJ.

 Still Roman a

I recently saw “Gladiator” in the
movie theater. The previews boasted
great battle scenes and the city of
Rome in all its majesty. It definitely
looked like a movie worth seeing for
$7.50. And it was my turn to see a
“manly” movie instead of a “chick
ﬂick” with my girlfriend. But instead
of being thrilled by this great cinemat-

ic extravaganza, I was disgusted by the“

Roman culture and realized that life
has changed very little in the last 2,000
years.

' Things have definitely changed L

externally for man with so much tech-
nical advancement, but has humankind
kept up internally, changing their
innate carnal thinking for the better-

ment of society as technology has
done? I don’t think so.

The first thing that ‘struck me about
“G1adiator” was how violence was
glorified for the entertainment of the
fixated movie watcher. It
was indeed captivating. I
talked to others after seeing
the movie, who said,
“Weren’t those battle scenes
awesome!?” I responded

Her all years  

for his sister. This was not surprising,
since Roman culture was obsessed
with sex. 0 I

Still, not much has changed. For
many people, almost every minute of
the day i-s spent wondering whether the
guy or girl over there is gay or straight,

married or single, too young, too old or '

just right. Do they want to have sex or
do they desire a meaningful relation-
ship? Are they good or bad in bed? We
have more meaningful things to worry
about other than pleasing our insipid
sexual desires. ,

In Rome there was even another
hedonistic outlet. The worship of the
gods entailed taking large amounts of
money to the temple for the indul-
gences of the priests and worshippers.
This money, lavishlylspent by the elite,
could have gone to those who were
starving in their midst.

Why is there still so much hunger? _

We spend money on too many,luxu-
ries, such as expensive jewelry, cars

and houses and do not give proportion- »

ally to charities or volunteer organiza-
tions. Why are there so many children

in foreign countries laboring unfairly, ,

being denied their due right to a life of
‘liberty and the pursuit of happiness?
The United States and other countries

desire bigger and better jewelry, cars 

and houses, making our enlightened
culture desire even more money. Just
as ‘one drug makes one desire more
potent drugs, big is to be replaced by,
bigger.

Also as in Rome, children live

only if the state or the governing body _

of the mother deems it acceptable.

_Infanticide was a common practice, as

was abortion (however, to a lesser
degree, because of its dangers). In
Rome, one of the parents would be
allowed to leave their infant on the
street or in the sewers if it was a

female or weak male. As was reported ,

ROBERT DITTMAN
Staff Writer

Popular ﬁlms spawn sequels,

remakes or an inevitable plethora of imi- _

tators. Follow-ups carelessly hazard per-
ilous cinematic reefs risking either brief,
high—proﬁle mediocrity or rapid oblivion.
Thankfully, “Fantasia” is an exception,
wisely renamed from its original tentative
moniker “The Orchestra Movie,” paving
the way for the new “Fantasia 2000.”
Sixty years have passed since a naive,
over—eager sorcerer’s apprentice “bor-
rowed” his master’s hat and orchestrated
inadvertent havoc, forming the comer-
stone of what was to become an endear-
ing piece of cinematic history. It was an
unforgettable classic called “Fantasia,”
the first feature to combine animation and
classical music, far ahead of its time and
met initially with only sniffling results
from the masses. '
Eight new segments and one return-
ing portion make up what is described in
press material as “animated imagery
[blended] with classical music.” The
result is a glowing, if slightly ﬂawed,
masterpiece, with live action segments

introduced in a tongue-in-
cheek style by Hollywood
notables Whoopi Goldberg,
James Earl Jones, Angela
Lansbury and Penn and Teller.
Even the awkward presence
of Steve Martin introducing
the first segment is not
enough to slow the proceed-
ings.

A A world of human and
natural experience, both
exhilarating and sobering, is
integrated into a deceptively
short 74 minutes, distinctly
abbreviated from the two-
hour original. One viewing
can never fully appreciate the
visual feast and colorful,

mixed with reﬂective, insight-
ful intensity as we go from
whales cavorting to
Respighi’s “Pines of Rome”
after a brief opening with Beethoven’s

Nine years after the Death Star
blew up, a small group of rebel sol-
diers took refuge in New Jersey and
worked undercover to bring balance
to the force.

Out of fear of being recognized,
they quickly devised a plan to pose
as indie rock musicians. Many crit-

“You Can Have.It All’’ is not I

some poppy cute little song with
nice vocals and a tambourine. It’s
bringing peace and contentment in
the universe. Happiness cannot
exist without fear. It is this com-
plexity that keeps fans. ’
Luckily in fifteen albums, they
have some unhappy songs like
“Autumn Sweater” because there

are always two, a master and an

apprentice. This understated yet
beautiful melody reminds me of my
days being held hostage in the trade p
blockade.

Traci Waites. . ' _ _ ,

Although they didn’t speak to " the
crowd at the event, Howland and Waites
were involved, as they were invited by
Pederson to take the first basketball shots
on the site.

Waites stepped up to a temporary bas-
ketball goal that had been set up and
aimed the ball toward the goal.

But s_he shottheball too hard and it
bounced off the rim. Embarrassed, she‘ - '
turned around and tossed the ball over
her head toward the goal, banking it in
off of the backboard to the cheers of the .
crowd. A

Howland then calmly walked up and
dropped the ball in over the rim. The
smile on his face told the story — he
was thrilled that the day had finally
come.

“This is going to be a first-class
facility,” Howland said. “We are wit-
nessing the construction of the finest
college basketball arena in the
country.”

Even though he was excit-

,ed - about _‘the, ceremony,
Howland said it was not the
day he was waiting for when
he took over the reigns of the
Pitt program just more than a
year ago. .

“The day I’m waiting fo

University to honor Joe Schmidt, as well

dominating athletes

In February of 1999, I wrote a
column with my picks for the 10
most dominating athletes in the
sports world.

I can’t say that I’m too happy
about those selections, but in case
you forgot or 5
didn’t read it,
I’ll refresh
your memories.

From ‘No.
10 to No. 1,
they were
Patrick Roy,
Jerry Rice,
Greg Maddux, John Elway, Hakeem
Olajuwon, Oscar de ‘la Hoya,
Cynthia Cooper, Dominik Hasek,
Pete Sampras, and Jeff Gordon.

And you think the Sports
Illustrated cover jinx is bad?

Not one of the ten athletes I list-
ed last year would make this year’s

   

list.

That’s just awful.

Cooper might have made it, but
she’s nearing the end of her career,
and that’s a no—no,, as proved by

Roy, Rice, Elway,
Olajuwon, and Hasek
making the list.

As far ‘as
Maddux is con-
cerned, he’s good,
but not as good as
two other hurlers

that come to mind.

I’m not pick-

ing any more boxers,
because the sport just doesn’t have a
dominant athlete anymore.

Sampras and Gordon are in the
midst of nose—dives.

as Dan Marina and 1980 football team

BRAD CUPRIK
V Assistant Sports Editor

As Pitt’s athletic programs and

facilities continue to change, the V,

history remains the same.-

The Panthers will recognize
some of that history on two separate
occasions during the upcoming
football season.- _"

First, Joe Schmidt, one ofthe
greatest linebackers in the history
of college and professional foot-
ball, will be honored during the
Pitt-Penn State game at Three
Rivers Stadium on Sept. 16.

Schmidt was a linebacker at Pitt
from 1950-52, and will beinducted
into the College Football Hall of
Fame in December. ’

His collegiate career was filled

with '1 injuries, but he led the
Panthers to a big win against,Notr.e
Dame in 1952. ' ‘

Schmidt gave an inspiring

pregame address to his teammates.

He followed that with a’ 60-yard
interception returfn to beat ‘the
Fighting Irish, 22-19, in South
Bend, Ind. _ “

He was named an All—American
that year, and is one of seven play-
ers to have his jersey retired byth.e
Panthers. . 1 ’

Schmidt wore No. 65 while with
the Panthers and for most of his
NFL career with the Detroit Lions.

He earned All-Pro honors in
eight of those seasons, and coached
the Lions from 1967-72, leading
Detroit to its only playoff appear-

made many fans doubters, but they made me look
bad and that’s just not a good thing to do.

Thanks, Pete. Thanks, Jeff.

So‘-,-{here isthe updated list, and my apologies
in advan_ce.to any athletesjwhose careers I ruin
with these choices. ' p I »

10. Gary Gait, National Lacrosse League

Gait is the NLL’s all-time leading scorer and
las_t year, he led the Pittsburgh CrosseFire in scor-
ing, posting 38 goals and 45 assists, good enough
for a first-place tie in the league.

He is considered the best lacrosse player .in
the world by many, and is one of only a handful
players that have endorsements. This guy is so
good that it was hard to keep him off the list, even

though no NFL. players will grace the top l0.

0 49. Chris Pronger, defenseman, St. Louis Blues

Pronger was given the NHL’s Hart Memorial
Trophy _as the most valuable player and the Norris
Memorial Trophy for top defenseman, beating out

the Penguins’ Jaromir J agr, and rightfully so.

He is considered the most‘ feared defender in
the league, but can also play offense as well.

Plus-minus is a forgotten statistic when”

stacked against goals, points, power play and
shorthanded goals, but may be more important
than any other. A 7

A player receives a plus when his team scores
a goal and he is on the ice. 0 '

A minus is given when the opposing team
scores. ’

Pronger averaged a pl_us—'50 over‘ the last two

‘seasons under the tutelage oflteamtmateg cA~l

Maclnnis.

8.'Alléfn Ivers'on,‘ gua‘rd,3 Philadelphia 76ers" ‘ » -
When youplayc for an ‘average7team,- you have’
’to dociabove-average things to get noticed. ’_ » “‘
‘.'It',"’,.<__lidn’t ‘take long for NBA opponents to 

noticelilvierson. “ c L ..
He can single—handedly take over a game
whenever he choos‘es'with a quick crossover drib-

ble, stingy defense and a near-perfect shooting

stroke.

If Iverson were wearing a Pacers. jersey, it-
would be hard to imagine the Lakers’-.celebratin‘g
their 12th NBA Championship. 7 \

7. Michael Schumacher, Formula One driver
He’s already won five out of eight Fl races
this year after suffering a_broken leg halfway
through the 1999 season. -
Schumacher changed to Ferrari four years ago

from Benetton when the manufacturer came back’

to F1 after a long absence. .

Although he did not perform as he is now
when he first switched over, he persevered and is
now reaping the benefits, by ‘not only winning the
races, but handily winning them.

6. , Shaquille O’Neal, center, Los Angeles
Lakers

If O’Neal could shoot free throws, he would
be near the top of the list instead of hovering
around the middle. , ’

I guess it’s easy to say he’s dominating now
that L.A. won the NBA championship, but it was
easy to see that no player can stophim defensive-
ly. .
He’s worked on his jump shot, and his post
moves, and head coach Phil Jackson’s triangle
offense has helped as well.

5. Pedro Martinez, pitcher, Boston Red Sox
4. Randy Johnson, pitcher, Arizona
Diamondbacks ' ‘
It waschard to choose between Martinez and
Johnson.
Both players have numerous victories under
their belts and led their respective leagues in

strikeouts and earned run averages.

.:-Martinez .is:;not as intimidating as the 6-foot-

Xll Johnson,  motion he puts on his fastball
‘keeps’ hitters "guessing, and that’s what makes him
» so hard to hit.'_.—‘‘., I ' A

Johnson plays‘ for a weaker team, which gave

him the inside track at No. 4.

He. c0.I,1;sis’tently*‘goes eight or nine innings,
striking out‘ 10 or more batters in a gamegand
keeps the D-backs near the top of the NL West

‘ division. '

If Arizona did not have Johnson, they would

.be near the bottom of the standings as would the

_;Red ilVlartinez.--‘ .4 

i3f:iMari;on Jones, track and field ‘B 

The former North Carolina Tar Heel basket-
ball player has turned to track after a horrible leg
injury, transforming herself into one of the best
track athletes in the world.

The upcoming 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia is the ultimate stage for her to
showcase her talents

I’m guessing right now that Jones will win
every event she’s in, givingher four gold medals.

I think she’s better than Jackie Joyner—Kersee
was in her prime and the late Florence Griffith
Joyner in hers.

2. Jaromir Jagr, forward, Pittsburgh Penguins

There is no better player in the NHL.

I don’t think you can say enough about a guy
that fights through injuries and consistently puts
up the numbers he does.

There are a lot of people that don’t like Jagr’s _

attitude or his commitment to the game, but he’s
damn good. a

Don’t think I’m biased because I’m in
Pittsburgh, because I’ve had to hear the things
said about him over and over again.

1. Tiger Woods, golfer

Jesus Christ! I just used the Lord’s name in
vain and. until now, it was never appropriate. ,

He beat the shit out of Pebble Beach. He let
everybody know exactly how poor they are com-
pared to him. . -

For every off—the.-mark tee shot he makes, he
comes back with a shot out of the sand to within
a foot of the cup.

_ » There is no better athlete inthe world.
Think about it, God is in Tiger Woods, literal-
1y. I v

You take God out and you got Two Ires, what-
ever that means.

Please don’t call me a heathen or a sacrile-
gious bastard. I’m just telling the goddamn truth.
That’s all.

is when we qualify for postseason
play,” Howland said.

Waites, on the other hand, was T

gushing with excitement when talk-

ing about the effect the Petersen

Genter will have on recruiting.
“These days, kids choose with

their eyes,” Waites said. “And when
‘ . they open their eyes and look at this

place, they won’t ever want to leave
Pittsburgh.”

. Howland concurred with Waites’
statement about , the effect on
recruiting. I

“The recruits can come see it
and it will be a sign of the
University’s ‘commitment to the
men’s basketball program,”
Howland said. . ,

Waiteslmentioned that when she
took the job, as Women’s basketball
coach at Pitt, she ‘had a conversation

with Pederson about the new facili-
tY- .. .

“I sat in his office two years
ago,” Waites said, recounting the
conversation. “He said,‘ ‘Hey, it’s
gonna happen,’ and I’m just really
excited that it’s taking place.”

Women’s basketball player
BrookecStewart, who participated in
an earlier part of the ceremony, said
she is excited about the possibility
of ‘playing in the new arena.

~“I can’t wait forlit to open,” said
Stewart, who just completed her
freshman year at Pitt.

The "arena is slated to open
sometime in late-2001 or early-
2002, leaving at least one more full
season at Fitzgerald Field House.

“Every day It drive down that
hill,” Waites said, pointing to
Sutherland Drive. “And every day, I
notice something new in the con-
struction. I can’t' wait until opening
night.” i

ance of the 1970s.

In 1973, he was inducted into
the Professional Football Hall of
Fame in Canton, Ohio.

Later in the season, on Nov. 4,
Pitt will honor Dan Marino and the
entire 1980 football team.

It is the 20th annivers‘f§i7y“«ii3if..thec

squad, which finished 111-1 and was
ranked No. 2 in the country by the
Associated Press and Unit‘ediPress
International. - 3;

The New York Times’ computer
poll actually ranked the Panthers as
the No. 1 team in the nation that
year. “

Marino just finished a 17-year »

career with the Miami Dolphins in
which he broke numerous NFL
records, including career passing
yardage, passes completed. and
passes attempted. ‘

He finished his four—year col-
lege career in 1982 as Pitt’s all-time
leader in passing yards and comple-
tions, but both marks were topped
by Alex Van Pelt in the early 1990s.

Marino still holds Pitt career
records for most touchdown passes
in a season and in a career.

“This will be a great day in
Pittsburgh,” said Athletics Director
Ste__v_e; Pederson, “We are excited to
br:ri1*g"Dan:M'arino and his family
back’ home to be honored in front of
the Panther fans for whom he pro-
vided.-Eiso many thrills.”

:One person who won’t be pre-
sent is the coach of the team, Jackie
Sherrill, who is currently the head
coach at Mississippi State
University.

Besides Marino, the team fea-
tured defensive end Hugh Green
and offensive lineman Mark May,
who both went on to illustrious
NFL careers.
