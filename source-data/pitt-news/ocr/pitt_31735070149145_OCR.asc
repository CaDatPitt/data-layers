State budge
passes, no
cuts to Pitt

The Pitt News Staﬁ”

Pitt can breathe a little easier this up-
coming year.

Gov. Tom Corbett signed the
$27.66 billion state budget for the
2012-2013 ﬁscal year into law late on
June 30 withoutacutinﬁmdingto the
state-related universities.

Corbett signed the budget before
the deadline for the end of the 2011-
2012 ﬁscal year after a busy Satur-
day session at which state lawmak-
ers scrambled past 11 p.m. debating
certainaspects of the coming ﬁscal
year’s spending plan.

The Pitt funding bill passed the
state House on a 184-12 vote before
passingthe state Senate. Penn State’s
ﬁmding also passed the house on a
177-19 vote before goingto the Senate.

"Sen. Mike Stack, D-Philadelphia,
said during the Senate debate that

V while he supports fundinghigher edu-

cation, he was “troubled” by the lack
of transparency from universities in
how they spend their money. He spe-
ciﬁcally addressed thejerry Sandusky
scandal that plagued Penn State as an
example of a lack of transparency and
said he wished that the state could
have made universities disclose how
they spend taxpayer moneythis year.

Corbett signed the budget in the
Capitol rotunda at 11:45 p.m., minutes
before the deadline. Last year’s sign-
ingtook place at 11:47 p.m. onthe last
night of the ﬁscal year. .

But ﬁnancial decisions are not
completely settled yet regarding tu-
ition. V , A A V

Colbert to visit Pitt in the fall

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Pitt students can pull outtheirAmeri-

can ﬂags and throw on their Colbert
Nation T—shirts. This fall, comedian
Stephen Colbert is visiting Pitt.

On June 28 on his satirical show,
“The Colbert Report,” Colbert an-
nounced he will visit Pitt as part of
the prize for four Pitt students who
won his “Colbert Super PAC Super
Fun Paclc’ treasure hunt. The contest
challengedparticipantsto create their
own Super PAC — an entity that can
donate money to political causes with-
out spendinglimits —— and go insearch
of a 101-year—old sterling silver antique
turtle—shaped bell.

Pitt students Dan Stough, Daniela
Aizpitarte, Ben Zaczek andjustine Bu-
chman teamed up to follow the clues
on the treasure map included in the
Super Fun Pack — a cardboard box
ﬁlled with directions for establishing
a Super PAC and treasure hunt clues.
Stough and Buchman are engineering

, H graduate students, and Aizpitarte and

Zaczek recently graduated ﬁ'om Pitt
withidegrees in engineering. Colbert
sold 1,000 of the packs, which includ-
ed comedic PAC—re1ated materials in
addition to the treasure map.

The Super PAC ﬁm pack is a com-
mentary on a controversial 2010 Su-

preme Court ruling, known as the Citi-
zens United decision, which said the
government can’t stop corporations
or unions ﬁ'om making independent
political expenditures. Critics say that
unchecked spending couldcorrupt
elections.

After the Citizens United ruling,
Colbert set up his own PAC and encour-
aged his viewers, whom he refers to
as “heroes,” to donate. The group of
Pitt students did, setting up a Super
PAC of its own. '

The goal of the Super PAC contest
was to demonstrate to participants
and“ColbertReport”vieWers the sim-
plicity of setting up a Super PAC. In
addition to ﬁnding the treasure, any
winners of the Super PAC challenge
hadtosetuptheirvery own Super PAC.
The Pitt champions called theirs “Pitt
PAC.”

“The Super PAC paperwork is lit-
erally like three pages,” Zaczek said.
“The cover letter’s like [a] mad lib.
They give you the template. You type
in your name, the organization, and
you sign it. That’s it.”

Stough boughtthe SuperFimPack
in April and immediately’ enlisted his
friends tohelp him solve the clues in-
cluded in the box. Through ﬁnals, re-
search and the series ofbomb threats
that plagued Pitt this past spring, the

I R

team worked together via an online
dropbox, where they could view the
clues and materials included in the
Fun Pack simultaneously.

“When I saw the Super PAC ﬁm

. packlthought, youknow,thisisprob—

ably something that would be a good
waste of time for everybody, and so I
bought it immediately, the same day’ ’
Stough said.

In a series of events that unfolded
“National Treasure”-style, the team
used a decoder ring, translated Ma-
sonic symbols and discoveredasecret

to calibrate a set of GPS coordinates.
These coordinates ultimately led them

Care Act
upleelel, will
have ﬁat  
on college
stuelents

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

The Supreme Court’s decision to
uphold the Affordable Care Act

is either a blessing or a curse for

college students, depending on
who you ask. - ‘

President Barack Obama’s
health care overhaul law, which
the Supreme Court upheld by a
5-4 vote on June 28, was most
controversial because of a clause
in the act that mandates that all
Americans, with a variety of ex-
ceptions, purchase health care
or face fines. Thosewho do not
obtain the proper insurance will
pay a ﬁne of $695 per person or
$2,085 per family. ;

The act faced a court chal-
lenge on the basis of whether
the federal government had the
power to place an individual
mandate on Americans.

But Chief Justice John Rob-
erts and the other four Court
members who voted in favor of
the bill determined the act is
constitutionally sound, as fines
for not purchasing the required‘
health care should be consid-
ered a tax. Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg wrote in her secondary
opinion that she believed the act
to be constitutional under the
commerce clause of the United
States Constitution, as well.

HEALTH CARE

Those who support the Supreme
Court’s decision see multiple beneﬁts
for students in the Affordable Care Act.
Pitt Democrats President Lara Sullivan
named two of the most widely cited perks
associated with the bill.

“Students can stay on their parents’
health insurance until 26 now,” Sulli-
van said. “That’s huge because we’re not
necessarily ﬁnding ajob right when we
graduate. This gives us time to ﬁgure out
what we’re doing and have good health
insurance in the mean time.”

Sullivan added that another beneﬁt
for students is that Americans under 19
can no longer be denied coverage from
insurance companies because of a pre-
existing condition.

Pitt College Republicans President
Casey Rankin and Pitt political science
professor and Supreme Court expert
Chris Bonneau also weighed in on po-
tential pros and cons for students in light
of the Supreme Court’s decision.

“I think it hurts students who are
graduating because most employers are
less likely to hire due to the regulations
and ﬁnes in [the Affordable Care Act] ,”
Rankin said.

Rankin cited an online poll conducted
by Forbes Magazine that asked small
business owners “On the 2nd anniversary
of Obamacare, where do you stand on

this law?” According to Forbes contribu-
torjim Blasingame, 78 percent selected
the pre-worded answer, “I don’t like it
and think it should be repealed,”_ on the
survey.

Bonneau dismissed possibilities such
as the one Rankin proposed with small
businesses, terming them “doomsday
scenarios.”

“There’s no evidence for that,” Bon-
neau said. “There are a lot of doomsday
scenarios that this will hurt businesses,
but there is no evidence.”

Rather, Bonneau sees the Affordable
Care Act as a catalyst for creating com-
petition in the health insurance sector
that will consequently drive down health
insurance costs.

“When you have exchange [of health
insurance] across states, you have more
choices and with more choices you have
better rates,” Bonneau said. “It’s like at
the campus bookstore. When you can
start to buy on Amazon, it lowers the
cost of books in the campus bookstore.”

Political prognosticators also disagree
on the sort of effect the Supreme Court’s
decision may have on the upcoming pres-

, idential election, or whether it will have
any effect at all.

Rankin believes that the Court’s deci-
sion spells out trouble for Obama’s re-
election bid.

“It’s a helpful issue in the election
for Republicans,” Rankin said. “If you
oppose the Affordable Care Act, the
only way to get rid of it is to elect Mitt

Romney, even if you aren’t crazy about
Romney.”

Rankin predicts that history will re-
peat from the 2010 election season this
year. He said in 2010,.a large number of
Republicans won seats in the Congress,
in part because of negative sentiment
against the Affordable Care Act.

“I think this energizes the Republican
base and anyone who opposes the health
care law,” Rankin said.

Sullivan takes the contrary view to I

Rankin. She views the Supreme Court’s
decision to uphold the law as an asset
for the president in his re—election bid.

“People voted for Obama in 2008
based on his plan for health care. He
promised the American people [during
that election] that when in ofﬁce, he
would reform health care. This will only
help his re—election campaign,” she said.

But Bonneau doesn’t foresee the Su-
preme Court’s decision as having much
sway on the upcoming election one way
or another.

“People who hated [the health care
law] are going to vote against Obama
and people who loved it are going to Vote
for him. What the Supreme Court said
isn’t going to make a damn bit of differ-
ence,” he said. “Your views haven’t been
changed just because the Supreme Court
said it’s OK.”

“Health care is an issue in the elec-
tion, but it’s a secondary issue to the
economy and everything else,” Bonneau
said. ﬂ V

BUDOET

Trustees meet onjuly 13.

Penn State President Rodney Erickson
pledged to not increase tuition for students more
than the level of inﬂation based upon last year’s
Consumer Price Index, which will be a 2.9 per-
cent tuition increase for Pennsylvania resident
students at the main campus and a 1.9 increase
atthe branch campuses. Penn State’s next Board
of Trustees meeting will take place next week.

The day before Corbett signed the budget,
Temple UniVersity’s Board of Trustees voted to
hold the line on tuition for the next school year.

Corbett said at the signing ceremony that he
was pleased to sign another new budget on time
and without imposing taxes.

House Majority Leader Mike Turzai, R—Brad—
ford Woods, followed up Corbett’s comments by
saying that the govemor’s administration “has
had the most ﬁscally responsible administra-
tion we have seen in our lifetimes” and it has
been focused on “getting the most out of public
education, higher education and public welfare.”

Pitt’s funding will remain the same as in the
2011-2012 ﬁscal year, with $136 million allocated
to the University from the state. The governor;
whose party holds a majority in both the House
and Senate, originally proposed a 30 percent
reduction to three of the four state-related Uni-
versities — Pitt, Penn State and Temple -— and
leaving ﬁmding for Lincoln, by far the smallest
state-related university, untouched. ‘

But Corbett’s plan met with resistance from

treasure and actually ﬁnding your treasure are
two different stories. The group experienced a
series of missteps and comedic errors while on
their hunt that Aizpitarte highlights in an entry
on her blog, Real Person in Real Life. -

Aizpitarte said the team’s experience in engi-
neering helped them ﬁnd the treasure.

‘‘I feel like we’re used to working on seem-
ingly impossible problems,” she said. “So we can
contemplate on something for hours on end.”

Their troubles were rewarded this past week
when Colbertﬂewthemto NewYork City, where
all four team members sat in on a taping of “The
Colbert Report,” met Colbert backstage, and
were in the audience for the usually closed—to—
the—public pre—taping rehearsal. The team went
to the taping in style, as “The Colbert Report”

lodged them overnight in a hotel overlooking _

Central Park and picked them up in Escalades
the next morning. _
_ “We got star treatment,” Aizpitarte said. ~

During the rehearsal, Colbert stopped mid-
joke to address the team sitting in the audience.

“He just looks over at us [and asks] ‘Who are
these people in the audience?” Stough said.

The crew turned the spotlight on the four
friends. — I ' I

“They’re thewinners ofthe SuperPAC,” acrew
member answered.

“Oh, hello, SuperPACwinners.I guessyou’re I 

the future of America,” Colbert said.

Then the lights suddenlywentdimand Colbert
spoke up from the darkness. “It’s all aruse. We’re
here to harvest your organs.”

The team enjoyed tl1e joke.

“He was so funny. Even off-camera, the jokes
that didn’t make it into the show were hilarious,”

, Stough said.

Stough went on the show to claim the team’s
prize, shaking Colbert’s hand and exchanging
dialogue for the last few minutes of Thursday
night’s program;

“Iwas pretty nervous,” Stough said. “[Screen—
writer] Aaron Sorkin was also on the show that
day and one womanwas like ‘Oh, Aaron Sorl<in’s

been on the showbefore, and he’sstillreally ner- '

vous. You seem pretty good though.”’

Stough revealed to Colbert during the taping
that the winning team hailed ﬁ'om Pitt, mean-
ing Colbert’s future destination would be Pitt’s
Oakland campus. Colbert threw his hands up
upon hearing the news and said, “Woo-hoo! It’s

members of his own party throughout the pro-
cess. Eventually, the state House and Senate
passed a $27.6 billion budget that ﬂat-ﬁmded
higher—education and public schools while cut-
ting funding for welfare by 10 percent.
Although normally, given inﬂation, ﬂat
ﬁmding might not be a cause for celebration,
this budget decision comes as good news to
the University, considering the 30 percent cut
Corbett originally proposed, aswellas lastyear’s
19 percent cutto Pitt’s ﬁinding. In 2011, Corbett
proposed a 50 percent cut to Pitt’s state funding.
The second year of proposed cuts sparked
conversation on campus that had once seemed

inconceivable. Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and other members of Pitt’s administration pub-
licly discussed the possibility that Pitt might
become a private institution, despite its being
state—related since 1966.

Once the inkhad begunto dry, the University
reacted positively to the news that Pitt did not
receive a cut.

Fedele said in an email that the University
was “grate ” to the politicians in Harrisburg
for keepingfunding atthe same level as lastyear.

“Legislators heard from many members
of the Pitt community; alumni, parents and
students, and their action is recognition of the
importance of strong research universities that
serve Pennsylvania’s best and brightest students
and are a huge engine of economic growth and
stability for the region,” he said.

Robert Beecher, chairman of Student Gov-

“We’re ecstatic that Pitt isn’t going to be re-

Beecher speciﬁcally cited Sen.Jake Corman, ~

Senate Appropriations Committee, for seeing
“the value inﬁinding higher education.” Corman
broke with the governor as early as February to
voice his support for ﬁmding higher education.

Beecher also praised the efforts of students

“If it weren’t for the efforts of everyday stu-

Harrisburg or personally write letters to their
representatives, I don’tthinkwe would be having

Cuisine valuable for cultural underslanding

Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

A few days ago, I returned from a
week-long mission trip to Nicara-
gua, and the thing that I miss most
is the food. The trip was truly a life-
changing experience, and I could
talk for hours about the community
of people we met living in a trash
dump, or the kids we met living in
a children’s home, or the beauty of
avolcano among mountains or even
about when I tried surﬁng.

But instead, I’m going to talk
about the food. And why, when trav-
elling intemationally, you should

make it a point to eat international

lllltorhllolldel

foods.

Nicaraguan food is delicious.
Really, really delicious. The spice-
ﬁlled ﬂavors of Nicaraguan cook-
ing stimulated my palate and had
my mouth watering before every
meal. From each breakfast, when
I was greeted with fresh fruit, to
each dinner, complete with heaping
spoonfuls of rice, I enjoyed nearly
everything I ate in the country (ex-
cept one dish in which I had an un-
fortunate ‘encounter with some sort
of plaintain—cheese-crepe-looking
thing).

The ﬁrst reason you should eat
international food is to broaden
your own palate and learn about

new tastes and ﬂavor combinations.
Iwas unsure about whether I would
like Nicaraguan food because I had
never had anything like it in the U.S.
I needn’t have feared. Now when
I go to restaurants or try a new
recipe, I know that I have a whole
new list of ﬂavors and tastes to add
to my meal possibilities. You may
ﬁnd that you really hate a differ-
ent kind of food, or you might be
pleasantly surprised to ﬁnd that
you really like it. But for the sake
of possibly broadening the ﬁeld of
ﬂavors you enjoy, you might as well
try international foods. Then, you

can at least be familiar with a wide variety of
ﬂavors and their home countries.

Another reason you should eat interna-
tional food is because it is the ﬁrst step to
truly experiencing a different culture and
community. If you are trying to understand

food of a country, you are eating something

that is perfectly unique to the place you are. T P
Just as food can help you recognize the simi-

larities in a culture, it can also help you realize S U
the differences. In Nicaragua, I noticed the

unique spices on most of their foods, and the O K
next thingI knew, I was paying attention to
the fact that women don’t wear shorts, even
in the heat, and that men don’t grow beards,

the differences between communities in dif-

cultural differences as well.

Ultimately, my advice to you is to eat in- ' ' ,
ternational foods just to have the experience. 2
If nothing else, you will have done something
outside of your comfort zone and tried some-
thing new for a while. Life is composed of new
experiences, one after another, to grow and

another culture, you ﬁrst have to start at its
most basic needs. A culture is composed of
people, and all people desire food, drink and
sleep. By tasting the food of another culture,
you can share in the basic human need for
food and gain an understanding of the culture
in the process.

One thing that I’ve noticed in many of my
international experiences is that many cul-
tures use similar products to create their food.

to shape your identity. But those new experi-
ences cannot be had unless you are willing
to chase them. You might as well start with

I At the same time that many ingredients are
similar in different food genres, many inter-
national culturesare still drastically different
in the methods they use to prepare their food,
the spices they use and even sometimes how
they eat food. If you’re eating the authentic

if possible, for every meal. ‘ ‘

Stripper Mike less than magical

Natalie Bell
Senior Staff Writer

“Magic Mike”

Starring: Channing Tatum, Alex
Pettyfer, Olivia Munn, Matthew
McConaughey

Directed by: Steven Soderbergh
Grade: C

With Channing Tatum yanking off
his tank top and Alex Pettyfer strip-
ping off his leather chaps — oh,
wait, “Magic Mike” had a plot?

Surprisingly, it did. Maybe the
storyline wasn’t beautifully poetic,
but an unofﬁcial poll of moviego-
ers showed that no one walked in
expecting the kind of depth seen in
“Schindler’s List.” If you went to the
male-stripper-themed movie to see
cinematic art, get out. Get out right
now and go stew in your pretension.

The only art in this movie -
custom furniture aside — is the
chiseled, Adonis-like bodies of the
leads, and that’s A—OK.

On an intellectual note, this
premise comes at a fascinating time
when mainstream media — think
“Fifty Shades of Grey” and porn
star James Deen —- is beginning
to exploit women’s sexuality with
the same blatant pandering that
they do men’s.

Did Steven Soderbergh, the di-
rector of “Magic Mike,” intention-
ally try to make this the feminine
complement to the male gaze?
Maybe.

Mike (Channing Tatum) is
30-something—years—old, has terri-
ble credit and works multiple jobs.
He moonlights as a car detailer, a
construction worker and the owner
of a custom furniture store, but his
primary income comes from taking
off his clothes.

One day he notices wayward
19-year-old Adam (Alex Pettyfer),
whom he introduces to the exhila-
rating and lucrative world of strip-
ping. Mike soon falls for Adam’s
responsibly employed older sister
Brooke (Cody Horn). While Mike
tries to charm her with his abs and
laid-back attitude, Adam learns to
pick up chicks and score drugs.

As Mike watches Adam descend
into debauchery, he sees a fork in
the road. He can grow up, as his

Matthew Mcconaughey works the stage in “Magic Mike.”
Warner Brothers Entertainment, Inc.

hook-up Joanna (Olivia Munn) did,
or he can keep working it on stage
and end up like sleazy club owner
Dallas (Matthew McConaughey),
wearing age — if not body — inap-
propriate skin-tight leather pants.

After a rough night, Brooke con-
fronts Mike about his man—child
lifestyle and then they all go about
in pursuit of a cliche ending.

Most things in the movie come
secondary to the gimmicky enter-
tainment. Tatum’s dancing out-
shines his acting — to be fair, he’s
a phenomenal dancer —~ and there
are more stripping scenes than a
character-driven movie would
need. There’s also little emphasis
on the actual emotional toll such
a lifestyle might have on a person.

That’s because this movie is to
strip clubs what romance novels
are to porn — in other words,
something sexually explicit pack-
aged and directed toward women.
There’s some wooing of the audi-

ence, some romancing, some shal-
low characters to root for and gads
of gorgeous, mostly naked men.
Like a dog-eared copy of any run-
of-the—mill Harlequin novel, sex
comes before plot.

And if the female gaze is simply
the camera panning up and down
a man’s body instead of a woman’s,
then this is, in many ways, the fe-
male gaze. But in a time when S&M
is moving to the mainstream and
heterosexuality is less and less re-
garded as the “norm,” thinking in
terms of men’s and women’s gazes

seems a bit outdated.

After all, there were plenty of
men sitting in the audience, lusting
after the leads.

It’s better to acknowledge that
openly casting men as the sexual
objects of a ﬁlm departs from the
more reﬁned and subtle sexuality
of a traditional male romantic-com-
edy lead. And the women, rather
than being doe-eyed romantic
heroines, are perfectly capable of
obviously pursuing sexual grati-
ﬁcation.

Make no mistake, this isn’t some
kind of intelligently novel look at
sexuality. For better or worse, it’s
the usual movie sexuality. Essen-
tially, it departs from the traditional
model of sexuality sold to women.

When the women control sex
in this universe, it’s not because of
withholding or shrouded advances.
For example,Joanna obviously uses
Mike for sex. She goes so far as to
tell him to lie there and look pretty
when he tries to strike up a conver-
sation about her life. I

In a way, it upends a longstand-
ing tradition of sexually passive
women in movies. As a converse,
consider Kristen Wiig’s helpless
character in “Bridesmaids,” hope-
lessly devoted to a jerk she hooks
up with.

“Magic Mike” might not be art.
It might not even be that great of a
movie, but it does serve as a marker
of what kinds of sexuality we can
portray in the mainstream.

And it’s pretty sexy, too. I

RESTAURANT REVIEW

New restaurant says
‘hello’ to Oakland

Anna Weldon
A€9°E Editor

Eat’n Park has a new dining op-
tion to offer Oakland residents
— and it’s happy to see you.

Hello Bistro, owned by Eat’n
Park Hospitality Group, recently
opened on Forbes Avenue, and
features an extensive menu fit
for the university student.

The restaurant is well-deco-
rated and its bright seating area
affords diners a pleasant atmo-
sphere. The open dining space is
complemented by a set of win-
dows that provide the room with
natural lighting to accompany
the simplistic decor.

Inside the restaurant, guests
pick up menus on their way to
the counter where they order
and purchase their meals. After
paying, each customer receives
a small sign displaying a num-
ber that servers use to locate
patrons While delivering their
orders. Meals come out of the
kitchen on silver trays similar to
cafeteria-style lunches.

But the food is nothing like
your average cafeteria cuisine.
Hello Bistro features an array
of burgers, grilled cheese sand-
wiches and side dishes in addi-
tion to its fully stocked salad bar.
Whether diners are seeking juicy
burgers or healthier options,

there are a Variety of selections ‘

available on Hello Bistro’s satis-
fying menu.

Hello Bistro’s menu is cen-
tered around an extensive salad
bar completely ﬁlled with a com-
prehensive selection of ingredi-
ents that customers can choose
to include in their salads. The
restaurant offers three differ-
ent types of lettuce, an excess
of toppings as well as meat, fish
and tofu options (for an extra
$2) to add on to the build-your-
own salads.

The salads all cost the same
amount, and toppings are unlim-
ited. Customers can build their
salads to fit their appetites and
they have a sufficient set of op-
tions from which to select.

Hello Bistro also offers pre-

designed salads for customers
who don’t want to create their
own. The “Salads By Us” section
of the menu provides seven op-
tions for those intimidated by
the large selection of toppings
at the salad bar station. ‘

For those uninterested in
greens, the list of burgers on the
menu contains many different
options and even offers a veg-
gie burger. The American Grill
Burger, a classic patty on Italian
bread, is covered with American
cheese, grilled onions, grilled
peppers and mushrooms. Served
with “ample patriotism” and a
little mustard, this burger is an
unlikely twist on the all-Ameri-
can favorite.

The American Grill Burger.

tastes delicious, with the perfect
amount of flavor, blending a few
vegetables and meat together to
form an unusually pleasant taste.
The Italian bread offers a nice
variation from the normal bun,
and it makes the burger more
reminiscent of a sandwich.

But for all of its taste, the
burger was lacking in substance.
For a burger, the portion size was
unexpectedly small, even smaller
than the veggie burger. French
fries do not accompany the burg-
ers, as they do in most restau-
rants, but must be purchased
for an extra $2‘. Though this isn’t
an unreasonable amount for the
sizable portion of fries, it’s still
less inviting to order them sepa-
rately.

What (Hello Bistro loses in
portion sizes it gains back in
ambiance. The restaurant is
pleasing with its open, clean at-
mosphere, and the Boylan soda
fountain provides the bistro with
an old—time feel that is frequently
lost in Oakland. Cream soda and
red birch beer made with real
cane sugar have a place next to
regular cola in the vintage soda
machine.

In Oakland, Hello Bistro is a
great place for students to go for
a quick meal that strays from the
fast-food options in the area, and
its nontraditional atmosphere
makes it quaintly collegiate. I

“People Like Us”

It’s not “Flowers in the Attic,” but watching
two siblings trifle with one another still
makes audience members squirm.

When one sibling unknowingly ﬂirted
with another — who was aware of their
familial relationship — for more than‘ an
hour, the audience Verbalized their dis-
comfort. And that little dance goes on far
too long, punctuating “People Like Us,” an

has died and is summonedfrom his adult
life in New York to attend the funeral in
Los Angeles. There, his dad’s lawyer gives
him, $150,000 to deliver to a half—sister
he’s never met, Frankie (Elizabeth Banks).

Here begins his pseudo—stalking, where
he purposely runs into her at AA and learns
about her grim perspective on their father.
And then he runs into her over and over
again until they eventually befriend one
another.

He begins helping out with her bright,
but troubled, son, Josh (Michael Hall
D’Addario), and hanging around with the
pair for weeks, even extending his home-
town visit in Los Angeles to stay with them.
All the while, Sam works to uncover why his
father abandoned his sister and her mother.

As Josh becomes more accustomed to
Sam’s presence and Frankie starts hinting
at a romantic relationship, Sam realizes he

has to come clean, a confession that could
ruin his relationship with both of them.

The movie lets Sam keep Frankie in the
dark too long. Maybe it speaks to the tal-
ent of the actors that they could elicit a
response from viewers, but nearly a half-
hour before Sam’s reveal, the audience
started shifting, muttering and otherwise
expressing that they wanted him to just
tell her already. 0

But there were many bright spots in the
movie to make up for that.

The actual story is riveting, exploring
family relationships, the lies parents keep

 Team of four Panthers loses at Greentree

VI}

: I:

I5

burgh Basketball Club Summer
Pro-Am league at the Greentree
SportsPlex, members of the Pitt
basketball team sought to stand
out among a group of players from
local NCAA Division I basketball
programs.

The games played on June 22
featured a comeback fueled by cur-
rent Panthers and breakout perfor-
mances by two Pitt underclassmen.

But onJune 27, local basketball

I fans witnessed what was perhaps

the most entertaining game of the
summer league thus far.

GNC 78, PGT Trucking 73

With a lineup featuring highly-
touted incoming Pitt freshman Ste-
ven Adams and Pitt redshirt junior
Lamar Patterson, few expected
PGT Trucking to face much diffi-
culty during the summer league’s
regular season.

But even solid performances by
Patterson and Adams, who scored
17 and 11 points, respectively,
couldn’t overcome a GNC team
that hit nine 3-pointers, includ-
ing four from Duquesne freshman
Derrick Colter.

Despite GNC’s hot shooting

night, PGT experienced a few op- ‘

portunities to seize the lead.
After trailing most of the ﬁrst

half, PGT mounted a comeback

highlighted by incoming Pitt fresh-

’ man point guardjames Robinson

scoring three of his 15 points by
drawing a shooting foul after hit-
ting a driving layup.

Pitt junior Trey Zeigler then
helped PGT maintain their lead
into the second half with a few im-
pressive buckets around the rim.

Zeigler, who transferred from
Central Michigan University to Pitt
this summer, scored 12 points in
the game. He said he struggled
to ﬁnish layups, despite his solid
numbers.

“I didn’t have that good of a
game. My teammates played well.
We had a chance to win it, but kind
of lost it at the end,” Zeigler said.

GNC reclaimed the lead for

”‘ good shortly into the second half

as a result of hot shooting by Col-
ter, who scored a game-high 21
points.

Incoming Pitt freshman Steven Adams scored 11 points for PGT as his -

team was upset by GNC at Greentree last week. Luv Purohit |Visuai Editor

Adams said he and his team-
mates continue using the games
as learning experiences.

“It’s more of just listening to the
team, because if I do something
different and the team is doing
something of their own, I’m gonna
screw up the team,” he said. “I have
to learn from them and just get into
their system of play.”

SPK Law 71, South Hills Audi 55

In a matchup pitting current
Panthers against former Panthers,
youth prevailed in the form of a
71-55 victory for SPK Law.

Pitt redshirt junior Talib Zanna
scored 11 points and pulled down
nine rebounds, displaying an im-
proved shooting ability for SPK,
who led throughout the game,

After struggling with the size
and skill of PGT in the previous
game, SPK produced a dynamic
offensive performance against the
depleted South Hills Audi, who was
missing its leading scorer through
three games in Pitt graduate Chev-
on Troutman.

Zanna said he has used the off-
season to improve the mid—range
jump shot he showed onJune 27.
He added thathe was disappointed
he wasn’t able to utilize the shot
against the absent Troutman.

“I wanted to play against Chevy
[Troutman] because we always play

at school,” Zanna said. “I wanted
to play against him because he’s an
alum, and he was playing [power
forward,] so I wanted to get a little
bit of experience against him.”
Pitt sophomore guard John
Johnson also added 11 points and
three assists in SPK’s victory.

Oliverio’s Peppers 89, Steel City
Tickets 44

Entering the offseason, Pitt
redshirt freshman Durand John-
son appeared to be destined for a
reserve role with Zeigler and red-
shirt sophomore Cameron Wright
ahead of him on Pitt’s depth chart
at shooting guard.

But onJune 27, Johnson showed
his ability by scoring a game-high
23 points for Steel City Tickets in
a loss against Oliverio’s Peppers.

-Johnson added six rebounds,

showing off an aggressive offen-
sive style during the game.

Steel City Tickets struggled to
contain the veteran West Virginia
and Duquesne players on Oliverio’s
Peppers, who used strong shooting
and a dominant post presence to
control the game. '

Pitt junior Aron Nwankwo add-
ed eight points and four rebounds
for Oliverio’s Peppers.

The league will ﬁnish its regular
season with games on July 9 and
July 11. I

BARNES BURNER

Pirates’ offense makes  

the difference in June

Nate Barnes
Staﬂ Writer

The Pittsburgh Pirates have been
winning a lot recently, but not in
the way that many of the team’s
fans wouldexpect.

This past Saturday, the Pirates’
record was 42-35, fresh off a 7-3
victory over the defending World
Series-champion St. Louis Car-
dinals.

A That win, Pittsburgh’s 17th in
the month of June, ensured the
Pirates their ninth series win out
of the past 11 played, with thetwo
non-winning series being a four-
game split with the Philadelphia
Phillies and a three-game sweep
against arguably the best offensive
team in baseball, the Baltimore
Orioles. T

Winning series at this rate
is pennant-style baseball. And
speaking of pennants and play-

offs, the Pirates of 2012 also have b

somethingin common with the
franchise’s last playoff team,
which wa‘s"’also the last Pirates
team to ﬁnish above .500 in a
season.

After Saturday’s win in St." Lou-
is, the Pirates were seven games
over the infamous .500 mark for
the ﬁrst time since the 1992 sea-
son, the last time the franchise
ﬁnished with a winning record.
The Pirates ﬁnished 96-66 that
year. A

But surprisingly, the key to the
Pirates’ 17-1oJune record was not
the credit-worthy pitching staff
led by James McDonald and A.J.
Burnett, who recently were both

' inexplicably snubbed from next ‘

week’s All-Star Game. Instead, the
offense keyed by the hot bats of
Andrew McCutchen, Neil Walker,
Garrett Jones, Casey McGehee
and Pedro Alvarez exploded this
past month to lead the Buccos to
the best record in the National
League.

This team’s offensive achieve-
ments inJune were even more re-
markable considering how atro-
cious the Pirates’ bats were during
the months of April and May.

For the ﬁrst two months of
the season, the Pirates posted a

dismal team batting average of
.219 and scored a league-worst
147 runs. But thanks to one of the
best pitching staffs in baseball,
the Pirates ﬁnished the ﬁrst two
months of the season at 25-25 and
in third place, three garrles be-
hind the Cincinnati Reds in the
National League Central Division.

But as the weather warmed up
inJune, so did the Pirates’ hitters.

The Buccos nearly outscored
their combined run total from

_ April and May by scoring a major-

league—high total of 146 inJune,
with an 11-7 victory over_Phi_l:a-
delphia onJune 27 and a 14-5
against the Cardinals on.June‘-29
displaying the Pirates’ neviiéfouﬁd
ability to win high-scoring games.

And more importantly, 'fh'e.P,i-
rates didn’t waste strong offensive
performances like they’l1l1*av<}L-gin
past seasons. A  J 

Manager Clint Hurdl‘e’s;j’sl;ug-'
gers scored seven or moﬂreiifuns
nine times in June. Thef‘P.irates’
record in those gameswas I

The drasticoffensive imp ve-
ments stem from a power surge
emanating throughout the month
ofJune, as the Pirates also clubbed
39 home runs to tie the team re-
cord for home runs hit in a month,
set by the 1975 Pirates.

Hitting so many balls over the
fence was a total team effort as a
number of Pirates produced excel-
lent —— and unexpected — power
ﬁgures.

McCutchen and Alvarez each
hit seven.Jones and McGehee hit
ﬁve. And even the diminutive Alex
Presley hit four after his return
from a stint in the minor leagues.

The Pirates’ impressive home
run total not only tied a club re-
cord, but it also was the most hit
by any National League team last
month and was surpassed only by
the American League’s New York
Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays,
who also are the top two home-
run—hitting teams this season.

As for all-around hitting in
June, the Pirates did well in that
category, too. The club combined
to hit for a much-improved .268

batting average, third-best in the National
League for last month.

McCutchen, who was named to his sec-
ond Al1—Star Game as a reserve on Sunday,
led the way by hitting a torrid .370, but he
wasn’t alone._Iones hit .300, Walker was at
.292 and McGehee ﬁnally snapped out of
his slump to hit for a .291 average.

Now just one game behind the Cincinnati
Reds and in sole possession of second place
in the Central Division, the Pirates have
the potential to be legitimate contenders

Pedro Alvarez (24) and the res of th Pires’ offense blosomed in June.CT Campus ‘

for the ﬁrst time in 20 years if this team
can continue to hit the way it did in June.

The Pirates have shown they are deter-
mined, and recent performances against
division rivals like the Reds and Cardinals
have proven that this team is capable of
staying in this playoff race.

Last season, many fans feared that the
Pirates would eventually fall off, and the
team ﬁnally did in August.

This season, I don’t have that feeling.

This is the year to believe.

After 20 years, it might be hard to take
this notion seriously, but the Pittsburgh
Pirates will be playing important baseball
well into the fall. E

Big East releases 18-game
conference schedule for Pitt

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team recently
found out what teams it will play during
what could be the program’s ﬁnal season
in the Big East Conference.

On June 28, the Big East released its
2012-2013 conference matchup sched-
ule for all 15 of its teams, sticking to an
18-game regular-season schedule despite
recently losing West Virginia to the Big 12
conference.

Panther fans will be excited to see that
Pitt has been given several home games
against the conference’s elite teams, with
Connecticut, Marquette, Notre Dame,
Syracuse and Villanova all scheduled to
travel to Pittsburgh to face head coach

Jamie Dixon’s team.

Cincinnati, DePaul, Seton Hall and
South Florida are the other Big East teams
that will visit the Petersen Events Center
this season.

Each team in the conference must face
four teams twice, and Pitt will face Cin-
cinnati, DePaul, Marquette and Villanova
both at home and away.

If the Panthers do leave the Big East
for the Atlantic Coast Conference after
this season, it’will mean that Pitt fans will
never again see Georgetown, Louisville,
Providence, Rutgers or St._]ohn’s visit the
Petersen Events Center for a Big East Con-
ference game.

Exact dates and times for Pitt’s confer-
ence and non-conference schedule will be
released at a later date. I
