medical school, dean responds

By Peggy Ferri
The Pitt News

A budget committee's report, critical of the management, planning, and control in the
medical school, was presented at the Jan. 9 Senate Council meeting and has had both
wide criticism and confirmation.

Pitt School of Medicine Dean Dr. Donald Leon called the report’s findings of signifi-
cant weaknesses in the administration of the medical school “unfounded criticisms” and
said he would reserve his opinion on the rest of the report. '

The report, entitled “Practice Plans of the School of Medicine and Their Impacts on
the Clinical and Basic Science Departments” made several recommendations, among
them the need for a long-range plan which identifies the role of practice plans in the
school.

Practice plans are a means of integrating private practice and academics by requiring
that a certain percentage of money earned by physicians or those involved in clinical work
within the university be funneled back into the operating budget of the university.

The report also said that the increase in medical school tuition does not seem to be
related to the establishment of practice plans and that problems in the basic science

gap departments do not appear to be directly caused by the establishment of practice plans.

These findings are the result of a two-year study that followed charges made by
biochemistry professor Dr. Robert Glew that the practice plans were not contributing
enough to maintain the quality of the basic science departments.

“I am enthusiastically in agreement with the report," Glew said.

He explained that the report shows that funds come from two sources: the medical
school and the university budget. Glew was referring to the report’s findings, which
indicate the medical school uses university funds to cover overspending.

“This takes away money that could be used to hold down tuition increases,” Glew said.

Pitt nuclear physics professor Dr. Wilfried Daehnick, who chaired the budget policies
committee, said the report emphasizes that the medical school does have real financial
problems.

Practice plans were set up to help increase the clinical income of the school, but,
according to Daehnick, the beneficiaries have fallen short of their responsibility to the
rest of the medical school. ,

“The job of the administration of the school is to see that balance is maintained,"
Daehnick said.

Because not all areas can be self-supporting, some areas are funded much better than
others, Daehnick explained. The control, therefore, should be handled by the dean and
less by the individual department chairs, he concluded.

One of the benefits of the report, according to Daehnick, is that it has brought
increased attention to the basic sciences and the concerns of the medical school.

“Students, not only in the medical school, should be concerned that general university
funds are used to cover the deficit of the medical school,” he explained.

Pitt’s contributions have increased from $2 million in l976 to $3 million in 1984; in
addition , this is a time when state and federal funding is getting harder to obtain.
Daehnick said the large deficit shows the that the medical school has not been well
managed.

Long-term planning is a difficult process, Leon said.

“A budget is a prediction," Leon said. “The practice of medicine is piecework, and it’s
impossible to be certain. ,

“Long-term planning is done three to four years in advance, and there are rate-controls
enforced by other parties [such as insurance] which do change, and sometimes you can do
no better than a best estimate.”

Construction underway

iWork-release center stirs reactions

By Jon Williams
The Pitt News

Reactions to the work-release
center for female offenders currently
under construction on Fifth
Avenue, across from Carlow Col-
lege, have been many and varied.

Kim Amma recently transferred
to Carlow from Gannon University
in Erie.

“There’s a jail across the street
from school there, too. So I‘m used
to the idea,” Amma said.

The facility, to be coordinated by

' the Program for Female Offenders,

lnc., will give women job-skills
training while they serve out the last
three to six months of ajail term in a
conventional jail system.

The facility was approved by both
the City Planning Commission and
the county commissioners.
groups have been faced with the
problem of overcrowding at the
county jail. The county chose the
Oakland site primarily because it
already owned the land.

The Oakland planning commis-
sion initially had expressed concern
about the center, especially for resi-
dents worried about what the

women might do during the time.

they spent outside the building.
Meetings with residents and officials
helped gained approval.

Although the jail’s neighbors are
concerned, most do not mind the
idea of having the newjail next door.

“It depends on how the security is
kept," said Daniel Montgomery. “I
don’t mind its being here. I guess
they had to put it somewhere.” \

“What they’re doing is good, but
not here. It won't have a terrible
impact on me, but the area is pretty
dangerous,” said Michael
Vanduren.

Joan Lathska, also a student at
Carlow College, said she has been
downplaying the new neighbor and
trying not to draw attention to it.

“I think it’s good,” Lathska said,
“as long as it’s supervised and the
security is maintained.”

Dorine Karnash, director of the
program for female offenders,
assured that the inmates will be
checked constantly both at the home
and at work.

“The types of people we will be
handling will be those convicted of
non-violent crimes, such as mail
fraud, retail theft and crimes of
property,” Karnash said.

Judy Washington, who will have
the jail in her back yard, has had
experience with a similar facility.
She works as a youth care counselor
at Shuman Center School for young
people.

“It will be supervised,“ Washing-
ton said, “[that’s] so much more
than other activities in the area. It
will be safer there at the new jail than
most places in Oakland."

Karnash said the new program is a
result of a lack of women’s training
facilities in county and state jails.

“Ten years ago, the local female

incarceration system was over-
crowded by 60 to 70 percent,” Kar-
nash said. “There were no programs
for rehabilitating the women in the
county jails.”

County and state programs for
women were almost non—existent,
she said.

“The only vocational programs
offerred by the state were dairy pro-
duction and harvesting.”

These conditions prompted Char-
lotte Arnold toxspeak out. Arnold
had been involved in the Women
and Girl Offenders Program until
1977, when it folded due to insuffi-
cient funds.

She began to petition local and
state officials to allow her to start a
program of counseling for women.
She was given approval and began
counseling women who were incar-
cerated or had had confrontations
with the law.

The program currently trains
women in secretarial skills. Earlier
attempts to teach vocational skills in
other areas were defeated by the glut
of workers already vying for those
positions.

“The object of the program is to
deter women from returning to
crime,” Karnash said. “Most of our
women have very low self-esteem.
Manycome from broken families
where they did not receive support.

“We must overcome their self-fed
prophesy that they will come to no
_;ood,” Karnash said. “They have
this feeling of ‘why try?’ "

9 The Pitt’ News,- Monday," Janua"ryil‘6, I984

Wiesel refers to Bible

By Ana Puga
The Pitt News

Events in recent history can be
better understood by studying the
Book of Job, Elie Wiesel said in his
lecture Thursday evening in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union multi-Purpose
Room.

“Why am I suffering? Why does
humanity‘ suffer? Why are the
wicked rewarded while the good
suffer? Job asked these questions we
all ask,” Wiesel said to an audience
of over 300.

Wiesel has written over 25 books:
his works include novels, plays,
short stories, essays, reportage and
an autobiographical memoir. A sur-
vivor of Auschwitz and Buchen-
wald, Wiesel is chairman of the
Holocaust Memorial Council. Wie-
sel teaches Judaic studies at Boston
University.

“It is incredible that Job believed
the three messengers that one after
the other brought him the news that
his cattle had perished, his land had
burned and his children had died,”
Wiesel said.

“How come Job didn’t say, ‘The

, messengers are all reading the same

bad script?’ Because Job wasn't Jew-
ish. So many times in our history we
didn’t believe the bad news,” Wiesel
said.

In the years between 1939 and
I945, messengers ran from one
ghetto to another telling of Nazi
atrocities, but people did not believe
them, Wiesel said.

' “The least victims can expect from
us is that we believe them and that
we listen to them."

The end of Job’s story is problem-
atic, but instructive, Wiesel said.

“When Job asks,‘Why am I suffer-
ing?,’ God answers his question with
a question, ‘Where were you when I
created heaven and earth?’ And Job
does not press his case."

Wiesel compared Job’s easy
acceptance of God’s failure to
answer ‘with the companions of

Lenin, who confessed too easily to
treason during Stalin's purges.

“They not only confessed to the
crimes they were accused of, they
invented new ones. If they were
accused of three crimes, they would
say, ‘No, it was 33 crimes.’ ” Wiesel
said.

Both Job and Stalin’si victims
inflicted themselves with humilia-
tion so that the world would believe
their innocence, he said.

“The innocents are punished
when the innocents feel guilty and
the killers do not. Evil is absolute in
certain times, while good is not,”
Wiesel said.

Afterwards, Wiesel related the
questions of Job to the questions
one should ask about contemporary
politics.

Asked what questions he would
ask about the fact that nuclear war
might extinguish the human race, he
said, “There is just one question I

would ask these people: Are you

mad? Are you crazy?"

He referred to his recent appear-
ance in a discussion of nuclear war
with Henry Kissinger, William F.
Buckley, Robert S. McNamara, and
Carl Sagan after the television airing
of the movie, “The Day After."

“I asked him [Kissinger] that, but
he didn’t understand,” Wiesel said.
“In their minds, they [the discus-
sion’s participants] have already
fought World War III. Unfortu-
nately, the debate depressed me
more than the film.

“Questions unite people, answers
do not. I believe that a human being
is measured not by his answers, but
by his questions. We must all ask our
questions from within our commun-
ities, from within our traditions," he
said.

When asked what one can do
about injustice, he said, “What can
you do? I don’t know... maybe speak
out. If a person suffers, I have no
right not to know it. I have no right
not to speak out.”

Budget report stirs response

continued from page one

According to the report, several
incorporated departments have
become fiscally independent of the
medical school since 1981. The
report did not question the need for
clinical departments’ income to meet
the operating costs of the school. It
did question the merit of having an
unbalanced institution, with some
departments free to grow without
limits if the growth is fueled by prac-
tice income.

The large, fiscally dependent
departments, such as radiology,

ticing physicians essentially unin-

volved with research or with the
training of medical students, the
report said.

Dr. Bertram Girdany, professor
and chair of the radiology depart-
ment, said students are taught the
techniques of radiology on- the job
rather than in a classroom because
of the nature of the subject.

“The department receives zero
dollars from Pitt. and it must teach
and offer services," Girdany said.

Girdany said he was upset at the
report’s remarks._

“The implication is that we oper-
ate in an irresponsible manner, and
that isn’t true." he said.

The Student Government Board
announced its goals for the upcom-
ing term at its first open meeting
held last Thursday.

Some of the issues to be tackled
include the Student Assembly, man-
datory teaching evaluations and the
LSAT program, said newly-
appointed chairman of Student
Assembly, Jeff Mallinger.

Board member Bob Kramer will
concentrate on the University
Senate and Implementation Com-
mittee appointments. improving
student basketball ticket distribu-
tion, reimplementing the Internship
Office and the Freshman Orienta-
tion program.

Striving for better communica-
tion with The Pitt News, John Geyer
will be the board’s liaison. In addi-
tion, Geyer has undertaken the pro-
ject of improving campus bus routes
and commuter parking. A

“We are ‘ooking into the present

to

campus bus route, Geyer said.
“With the estimated 270 people who
will be moving into the fraternity
complex, one busjust isn‘t enough."

David Pikovsky, initiator of the
project to improve the basketball
ticket distribution, will also be inves-
tigating the University Book Center
—-- its policies and possible alterna-
tives to them and the possibility of
extending library hours to 24-hour
service during exam periods.
Pikovsky will also serve as the liai-
son to the Resident Student
Association.

Newly-appointed president pro
tem Pamela Hartwill be reviewing
servicability of dorm elevators. Her
other projects include working on
Commuter Affairs and the Book
Center and performing as liaison to
the Academic Affairs Committee.

Reviewing the Book Center’s
present policy of buying back used
books will be business manager
Betsy Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick will
also look into locating 24-hour
study areas during exam periods and
improving the Freshman Orienta-
tion program.

In conjunction with his campaign
proposal, Avery Abrams will be
working toward eventual installa-
tion of a cable television network
within the dorms. Abrams will serve
as liaison to the Engineering Cabinet
as well as working on the LSAT pro-
gram and the University Senate and
Implementation Committee
appointments. .

Jim Haug is undertaking work
with the InterHonorary Council and
will act as its liaison to the board.
Haug will also work on the issues of
the Student Assembly and basket-
ball ticket distribution.

In other business. an allocations
report was given by chairman Steve
Smith, who stated that presently 65

.to 70 organizations will be involved

in budgeting. The Feb. IO budget
deadline was stressed.

The board unanimously accepted
Smith's request to investigate and
reorganize the student organization
phone usage on the fifth floor of the
William Pitt Union. With certain
restrictions placed on long distance
usage, the board elected to budget
the phones.

’ Democratic Debate

. Last night’s debate between the eight Democratic presidental
candidates, presented on the Public Broadcasting System, set a
precedent for public discussion that should beapplauded and
continued. I

The new format was designed to keep the candidates from
making soap—box speeches. ABC’s Ted Koppel questioned the
panel for the first one and a half hours, and then talk-show host

Phil Donahue conducted the debate question—and-answer
style, similar to that of his talk show. '

Koppel’s segment was well-paced and probing, forcing the
candidates to answer tough, pointed questions. Donahue’s
portion was less orderly, and the important questions were only
addressed when the audience asked for “yes” or “no" answers.

Most importantly, the debate forced the candidates to think
quickly on their feet, and the pressure often revealed some of
the behind the scenes alliances that appear to be developing
within the party.

A majority of the Democrats came out in favor of a nuclear
freeze, the possibility of a woman vice-president, the need for
the Equal Rights Amendment, support of Affirmative Action
and support of the Pro-Choice Movement in the abortion
issue. All of the candidates stated that they were opposed to the
reinstitution of the military draft except Texas Senator Ernest
Hollings who said the volunteer system only attracts people
who can't find meaningful jobs elsewhere. This, according to

a Hollings, may get large numbers of military personnel, but of

inferior quality.

The debate was successful in presenting both the views of the
eight Democratic presidential candidates and an overview of
the Democratic party's platform. One hopes that this will set a
campaign precedent and that other such debates will be held
before November’s election.

Missing Uranium

The Energy Department and Congress must begin to work
together on the problem of nuclear plant security before a
needless disaster occurs. _

Enough uranium to build 85 atomic bombs has disappeared
from a single government weapons factory in Tennessee over
the last 35 years. This shocking revelation, reported yesterday
by the Scripps-Howard News Service, is the latest in a long
series of reports of missing weapons-grade uranium and pluto-
nium from government and commercial nuclear facilities. In
this case, however, the losses at the Y-12 factory in Oak Ridge,
Tenn., are the largest ever reported.

Officials at the Energy Department, which owns the plant,
and of Union Carbide, the private contractor that uses it to
make nuclear weapons, have reportedly refused to discuss the
losses. But unnamed sources familiar with Y-I2 say they would
not be surprised to find that some of the uranium had been
stolen, possibly by plant employees, according to Scripps-
Howard.

The most ironic aspect of the ongoing security problem is
this: The level of “lost" uranium needed to warrant an FBI
investigation varies from plant to plant and is based on records

of each plant’s past losses. Therefore, enough material to make '

seven nuclear bombs could disappear in one month from Y-12
without triggering an investigation —- simply because Y—l2 has
always been slipshod in its security.

It is clear that such bungling mismanagement must not be
allowed to continue. The stakes are simply too high for the

Medical School

leadership
attacked

The seven faculty members of the
Senate Budget Policies Committee
who toiled for two years researching
and writing their report “Practice
Plans ofthe School ofMedicine and
Their Impacts on the-Clinical and
Basic Science Departments” have
done a great service to the univer-
sity, the community and the citizens
of Pennsylvania. Their report shows
how the 14 clinical departments and
the highly profitable medical prac-
tice plans that each one operates
have ravaged the School of Medi-
cine and how their unfettered pro-
liferation and growth since I977
have done incalculable damage to
the quality and ﬁnancial stability of
the school.

One of the principal findings of
the study is that the School of Medi-
cine is essentially without leader-
ship. Sweeping away every
administrator in the chain of com-
mand between, and including, the
dean and the chancellor will alone
not solve the problems ofthe School
of Medicine, for as the report docu-
ments, fundamental structural
defects exist in the organization and
control of the practice plans.

The Budget Policies Committee‘s
report describes a medical school
devoid of long-range planning or
any ‘significant planning what-
soever, headed by an ineffectual
dean dominated by powerful and
autonomous profit-seeking heads of
clinical departments who care only
about their own fiefdom and not a
hoot about the school, the university
or the impact of their selfish actions
on the quality of scholarship or the
cost of tuition.

The report shows how practice
plan revenues were used to bloat
clinical departments far beyond any
reasonable staff level at a time when
tuition at the School of Medicine
nearly tripled. The report also con-
cluded that practice plan depart-

ments have contributed less than _

l percent of their net income
towards the revitalization of the
basic sciences and went so far as to
imply that the embarrassing three-
year accreditation the school
received from the Liaison Commit-
tee for Medical Education in I980
was due in part to the malignant
clinical practice plans. The 25-page
report confirms the fact that while
income from the practice plans rose
into the tens of millions of dollars,
the clinical departments continued
to drain millions from both the med-
ical school budget and the general
university appropriation from the
state, all without improvement in
the quality of instruction or
research. ‘ " ‘

Although perhaps not on the
verge of collapse, the School of
Medicine is in serious trouble with
conditions still deteriorating. Since
the practice plans as presently con-
stituted are the cause of most of the
problems, those who regard them-
selves as friends of the university
must act promptly and decisively to
harness the clinical practice plans;
unless the plans are unified and
strictly regulated, authority in the
School of Medicine will remain
divided, making coherent strategy
impossible.

Beyond the recommendations
made by the Senate Budget Policies
Committee. a solution to the School
of Medicine problem should involve
the following elements:

I. The resignation of the dean of
the School of Medicine and the
chancellor for their failure of
leadership.

2. The immediate reorganization
of the practice plans into a single
administrative unit.

3. The imposition of an equation
that would return l0 percent ofthe
net revenues of the practice plans to
the hard budget of the School of
Medicine. ~

4. The drafting of a set of public-
ized guidelines describing the struc-
ture and operation of the unified
practice plan.

5. The creation of a standing
faculty committee with campus-
wide presentation to oversee the
clinical practice plans.

Ticket policy
defended

The editorial, “Standing Room
Only," in the Jan. 6 issue of The Pitt
News presented a view ofthe basket-
ball ticket distribution situation
which may be viewed as accurate
until one considers the actual facts
behind the situation.

FACT -- The Athletic Depart-
ment donates all student tickets for
football and basketball games to the
Office. of Student
distribution.

FACT —- Students at other
schools in the Big East must pay a
fee for every basketball and football
game they attend. Pitt students are
not charged one cent by the athletic
department. p ‘ V _ ,

FACT —— Ticket distribution pol-

Activities for ‘

icy is formulated by the Office of
Student Activities and not by the
athletic department.

FACT — The student ticket allot-
ment has not changed greatly over
the last four years, and most changes
are the results of changes in the Field
House itself.

FACT — There is a $9 fee for
football tickets, but this charge is
assessed by the Office of Student
Activities in order to cover their
costs associated with theidistribu-
tion of those tickets.

The alternative approach pres-
ented in the editorial was in fact infe-
rior in several aspects to the current
distribution system. The proposal
cited recommends issuing students
with a ticket to be punched at each
game. If this proposal would
amount to a “season pass,”then only
those students who were among the
first 2,000 to pick up their passes
would be able to go to games. lfthis
is the proposal you advocate. then,
you are decreasing student partici-
pation by limiting it to the 2,000 sea-
son pass-holders.

If your proposal would be to
issues every student a season basket-
ball pass, then this would return us
to the anarchy that caused the imple-
mentation of the current situation.

The only thing stated correctly in
the editorial was that the problem
concerns supply and demand. The
current distsritution system gives
every student the opportunity to see
Big East Basketball on a first-come-
first-served basis. Any other distri-
bution system would be inequitable
in nature. The current distribution
system gives every student an equal
chance, which is a benefit not
afforded by your proposed system.

Primary advice for the undecided Democrats

Whom are you going to vote for in
the ‘upcoming -presidential primary‘?
If you are a registered Democrat
voting in Pennsylvania, you have
approximately 12 weeks to decide

I, am going to assume that there
are; two alternative scenarios which
may present themselves come April.
The first has Mondale leading Glenn
by a significant margin, with the rest
of the candidates quickly fading.
The second has Glenn closing the
gap on Mondale, but once again, the
other candidates are lagging far
behind.

Let‘s begin with scenario number
one. Conventional thinking has it
that you should vote for Mondale
because the others don‘t have a sig-
nificant chance for victory. “Why
waste a vote on one of the minor
candidates?" you might ask. The
answer is that a vote for an eventual
loser is not necessarily a wasted vote.
Keep in mind that the primary elects
no one to office. lt merely selects
delegates, who in turn choose a
party representative.

Voting for a candidate simply
because he is going to win is of no
value to the party. Disregard the
arguments advocating landslide vic-
tory in the primaries as a means
toward party unity. There will not be
a divided party in l984, as every can-

' didate has made plainly clear. Even

Jesse Jackson, the candidate most
likely to stir up party controversy,
has said, “I choose a broken heart
over a broken party.”

It is up to us, the rank and file of
the Democratic party, to choose the
direction our party takes in the
future. Our opportunity to express
our opinions is drawing near. Will
we squander it by simply validating
what appears to be afait accompIi?l
hope not. If you feel that minorities,
and blacks in particular, have been
neglected by the party, then you

should vote for Jackson irrespective-

of his chance for victory. l am partial
to Hart on account of his voting
record on foreign policy isues (non-
intervention in Central America and
the Middle East), his opposition to
the arms buildup and his advocacy
for a national industrial policy. If
you feel very strongly that the
nuclear arms freeze is the most
important national issue, then a vote
for Cranston will clearly deliver that
message. The point is that the prim-
ary is a rare opportunity for you to
vote on principle, especially when it

is clear—cut as to who the eventual
winner will be.

The second scenario presents
some additional problems that make
principle a poor criterion for your
voting decision. In a two-man race (I
am assuming Mondale and Glenn),
a vote for a third candidate can be a
very destructive proposition. For
example, take the l980 race between
Reagan and Carter. Those Demo-
crats who voted for Anderson were
not making a protest vote against
Carter as much as they were plac_i_gg

a vote for Reagan. When the race is
between two men only, a vote for a
third candidate is a vote against the
better of the two prime candidates.
Therefore, if the race is between
Mondale and Glenn, forget about
the others and pick the better ofthe
two. The same analysis holds for the
presidential election —- vote for the
lesser of the two evils rather than a
third candidate or no one at all.

In order to make an intelligent
decision on April 10, we must first

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

determine which scenario is applica-
ble to the current political situation.
The combination of polling surveys
and results from earlier primaries

should make clear to us exactly

which scenario is in effect.

Many of us, especially college stu-
dents, complain about our power-
lessness in the political process. I
have no sympathy, though, for those
who do not vote, and little more for
those who do not use their vote
wisely. V

Tiger Paul not a good bet to return

No doubt, his feelings were hit
hard. The hurt was so deep that he
didn’t just stay away, he moved
away.

Nowadays, Tiger Paul Auslander
is working forJimmy Vaccaro’s Bar-
bary Coast betting line in Las Vegas.
That’s after spending more than l0
years as Pitt's unofficial cheerleader
during the basketball games at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

That’s also after former Pitt
cheerleader coach Karen Agosti-
nella, tired of the relentless upstag-
ing of her own troupe by Tiger Paul,
had him removed from the Field
House.

Now, Agostinella is no longer an
employee of the university, as of
Jan. 6.

Agostinella, called “a Hitler-type,
a real ruler" by a current cheer-
leader, finished a stint nearly a
decade long with Pitt and stepped
down after her latest brush with
popularity, which followed her

attempts to keep the Pitt Panther
from travelling to the Fiesta Bowl.

The guy under that fearsome cos-
tume, Brian Herr, eventually
reached Phoenix, but ‘Agostinella
didn't. She decided against continu-
ing the fight any longer.

It was her sole campaigning
against Tiger Paul‘s presence during
the '70s and into the ’80s that led her
to that fateful decision two years
ago. Oh sure, Tiger Paul was around
last year —- especially for those big
wins over St. John’s, Syracuse and
Georgetown —- but he’s going on 40
now and isn’t in the best of shape to
deal with the Agostinellas of the
world.

Her ire got the best of him. So
now he’s taking bets, sweeping
floors or waiting tables for those
wealthy ones who try to attain finan-
cial security for ‘their immortal
souls.

It is the craziness behind all this
that made Tiger Paul an institution
at the Panthers’ home games. OK,

maybe he looks like everyone’s di-
sheveled uncle. Granted, maybe his
antics belong more in a zoo than
before civilized people.

And, yeah, maybe Agostinella did
have a point in being fed up with his
upstaging. But just remember that
the cheerleaders themselves never
minded this “competition.“

Perhaps the plea for Tiger Paul‘s
return would not be so great were it
not for this recent turn of events.
Somebody had to actually bring in
the football cheerleaders for Satur-
day night's game against Duquesne
because there has been a noted lack
of enthusiasm on the fans’ part.

Are “Pitt fans” really losing their
verve? The query will be left to sit as
merely speculative in nature. But
this situation could deteriorate. Not
only must the Panthers start to
atone for an 0-3 start in Big East
play, but big games against Syracuse

Pitt’s Jack Uppling gets wrapped by Mil

night’s action.

By Tim Dinger
The Pitt News

The Panther wrestling team had
its record moved to 3-3 after picking
up only one victory out of four in a
four-day ordeal that started Wed-
nesday and ended Saturday.

On Wednesday, Pitt fell to 11th-
ranked Lehigh 43-3, with only one
Panther managing a victory.

On Thursday, the Panthers trav-
eled to Mt. Lebanon High School
only to fall to the Arizona State Sun
Devils 32-17.

On Friday at the Field House, the
Panthers pulled off the only win in
the four-day stretch by hammering
Millersville 32-5,while on Saturday,
they traveled to West Virginia, los-
ing 21-18 in a battle that was decided
in the final match.

"We saw a lot of good things, and
we improved a great deal from'the
first match to the last,” said head
coach Rande Stottlemyer. “We
started out flat against Lehigh and
against West Virginia, we had good
intensity, and I really had a good

feeling about the way we
performed."

Only one Panther managed to win
all four matches -- 126 pound
sophomore Kyle Nellis (18-4).

In the only Pitt victory against
Lehigh, Nellis handled Todd Cassan
12-7. On Thursday, he pulled out a
major decision, over the Sun Devil’s
Gary Bairos 9-0, while on Friday, he
beat Millersville‘s Mark Kirchner
11-7. Against West Virginia, Nellis
worked for a much-needed superior
decision against Steve Genco 14-2.

“Kyle did a nice job for us this
week; how can you argue with suc-
cess?" said Stottlemyer. “Sure, he
has room to improve, but he always
got the extra points that we needed.”

One hundred and sixty-seven
pound Jeff Jelic (16-2) also had a
successful week, going 3-1 with his
only loss coming to All-America_Jim
Rielly of Lehigh 6-3.

“He didn’t wrestle Rielly as well as
he could have,” said Stottlemyer.
“He missed a—takedown early in the
match that he should have had, and
that gave him [Rielly] confidence.”

Jelic, put the loss behind him and
won three straight, starting with a
pin at 4:41 against Arizona State’s
Eric Hayes. ’

On Friday, he continued to domi-
nate the mats by hammering Mil-
lersville's Dave Pierce 16-6 and

finished on Saturday against West
Virginia with a 10-5 win over Gor-

A big surprise in‘ the Panther
lineup was the addition of freshman
Hal Bolin at 118 lbs. He is the
younger brother of 142-pound Gary
Bolin and was recruited by Pitt but
opted not to wrestle. Two weeks
ago, he changed his mind and
decided to put on a Panther uni-
form, and Stottlemyer decided to
put him in the lineup after sopho-
more newcomer Bob Pisone, step-
ping in for the injured Snyder, "lost a
30-0 match against Lehigh's Damian
Butler. .

Bolin started off on the wrong
foot, getting pinned his first time out
by Arizona State’s Jim Lefebvre
with only nine seconds left in the
match.

He redeemed himself by stomping
Millersville’s freshman Dave Mc-
Ivor 15-7 and went on to handle
West Virginia’s Jeff Leaf 10-5. Leaf
had beaten Lefebvre 12-7 just three
days earlier.

“He turned around to beat a kid
who had beaten the guy who hadjust
pinned him [Bo1in],” said Stottle-

The Panther swim team visited
Happy Valley to face the No. l-
ranked team in the East —- arch rival
Penn State. Although the Panthers
won by a small margin, 58-55, they
were more than satisfied.

The excitement at Happy Valley
was at a peak because it was the
Alumni Homecoming Weekend and
this crowd was anticipating a vic-
tory. But to their dismay, the
Panther team pulled a remarkable
win during the last event, the 400-
yard freestyle relay. Ironically, the
‘anchor man for the Panthers, senior
co—captain, Ed Bahan, was a transfer
from Penn State. The finale was
surperb and unexpected.

At the outset of the meet, the

2 Panthers were ranked No. 15 in the

East. The Panther team was ready
for a victory even though they were
the underdogs.

“Actually, we thought that we
could win by a larger margin
because we haven’t been defeated by
the State team in 10 years, coach
Fred Lewis said.

ThePitt News, Monday, January 16, 1984

A necessary victory for Pitt in the
opening event established the
momentum for the meet. The 400-
yard medley relay team of Ed Ber-
gen, Don Martin, Richard James
and J.D. McCrillis won with a time
of 3:31. There were other reasons for
the aroused Panthers.

“The kids got psyched over some
of the personal records that a couple
of the kids shattered,” Lewis said.

Distanceswimmer and freshmen
Tom Shaulinski took second place
in the l000—yard freestyle event with
a time of 9:5l.2, a lifetime best.
Shaulinski also took second in the
500-meter freestyle with‘ a time of
4:475. ,

Another personal record was
broken by freshman Frank Williams
in the 200-meter butterfly. Williams
took fourth place with a time of
1:59.99, his first time under.2:00,.
Williams also received fifth place in
the 200—meter breaststroke with a
time of 2:l8.6. Martin won the 200-
meter breaststroke with the time of
2:09.5

“Overall, we scored where we
thought we would score,” Lewis
said. “There were no major contri-
buting factors, we just swam fast

enough to win.“

The closeness of the meet can be
seen in the 200-yard freestyle where
Panther swimmer Greg Murphy fin-
ished second to Penn State Barry
Marlin, losing by only one-one hun-
dredth of a second.

Other important events were the
200-meter butterfly and the 200-
meter backstroke. ln-the butterﬂy,
State swept the first three places, but
the determined Pitt team countered
with a sweep in the backstroke as
Bergen and James took the first two
spots with times of l:54.5 and l:54.9,
respectively. The Panthers were sat-
isfied with their times.

Bahan won the 50-and I00-yard
freestyles with times of 21.3 and
46.7, respectively.

In the diving events, Pitt came in
third in both the one-meter and
three-meter events. Diving events
are what actually kept the meet so
close, as Penn State received 16 ofits
55 points in this event, while Pitt
received only two.

It was a great victory, but the
Panthers still have some stiff compe-
tition left. Next weekend, they will
play host to LaSalle who defeated
the Panthers last year.

...while Lady Lions extend streak

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

Despite an 89-51 dual meet loss at
Penn State Saturday, the Lady

Panther swimmers and divers put
forth a gallant effort.

“I never enjoy losing," coach
David Belowich said. “But we swam
well. Many ‘of our swimmers
achieved personal goals."

Freshman Susan Hickman was a
triple winner, taking first in her spe-
ciality, the 50-yard freestyle, with a
time of 23.98. The Orlando, Fla.
native also placed second in the l00-
yard freestyle and was part of two
winning relays, the 200-yard medley
relay and the 400-yard freestyle.The
medley team of Hickman, Tracy
Pfister, Wendy Morgan and Denise
Sedlacek combined to post a time of
1:50.40. The time for freestyle of
Hickman, Pfister, Chris Kaucher
and Alicia Dugan was 3:39.69.

Pfister took first in the 100-yard
butterfly with a time of 59.l3, while
taking third in the 200—yard free-
style, setting her own personal best
time (l:54.74). Jodi O'Neil won the
200-yard breaststroke, covering the
distance in 2:26.20 O’Neil also took
third in the 100-yard breaststroke
and the 200-yard individual medley.

In the diving competition, Jen-
nifer Brown took second place in the
one-meter board with a score of
236.02 while in the three-meter
event, Tricia Schultz finished
second, earning 269.47 points.

Other Pitt top finishers included:
Stacy Moller, second in the 500-yard
freestyle and third in both the I000-
yard freestyle and the 200-yard but-
terﬂy, Georgia Spolsky second in
the 200-yard backstroke and third in
the 100-yard backstroke, and Chris
Kaucher, fourth in the 1000-yard
freestyle.

Despite suffering the first dual-
meet loss in the l983-84 season, the
meet showed the power of Penn
State rather than Pitt‘s weaknesses,
according to Belowich.

“I was very pleased with the

, meet," he said. “We fared quite well

against one of the top swim teams in
the nation.”

The next Lady Panther meet will
be this Saturday, as Pitt hosts Clar-
ion, four-time Division ll national
swim champions.

Other Panthers who fared well
this week are 134-pound senior Joe
Throckmorton (13-5) and 142-
pound Gary Bolin (7-9), both going
2-2.

Throckmorton started off poorly,

‘falling to Lehigh’s Brian Yates 14-10
and then giving up a pin to
nationally—ranked Tom Riley of
Arizona State. Throckmorton was
going for a tilt when Riley stopped
his motion, leaving Throckmorton
on his back for the 3:58 fall.

Throckmorton came back with a
pin over MillersvilIe’s Eric Kammel
in 5:44, and then major-decisioned
WVU‘s Greg Perry 10-2.

Bolin's two victories came from a
14-0 superior decision over Paul
Bronstein of Arizona and a 7-3 win
over Craig Camasta of Millersville.

. Although the Panthers lost to

WVU, it was, according to Stottle-
myer, one of his squad‘s better
performances.

“We wrestled as well as I've seen
us wrestle last night [Saturday],” he
said. “We out-wrestled them. We
had more intensity. We did every-

enough points to win the match."

)

The Panthers started the match by
taking a 12-0 lead with the victories
of Hal Bolin, Nellis and
Throckmorton.

West Virginia’s first points of the
evening came when freshman Mark
Sanders of WVU downed 142-
pound Gary Bolin 13-2.

Panther Joe Bond (12-10) got his
first victory of the week whenhe
downed WVU’s Jim Battisto 6-2.

West Virginia got the tide rolling
back to its side when Gordon Turner
mauled Pitt’s Greg Dille 19-1.

Jelic then defeated Taylor, which
was to be the last Pitt victory of the
evening.

WVU‘s luck started showing up
when 177-pound_R.J. Costello
caught Pitt's Kurt Joseph (4-5) and
threw him to his back with 29
seconds left in the match.

At 190-lbs, Panther Jack Uppling
(5-7-1), with a four-point lead and

eight seconds on the clock, was
thrown to his back, giving WVU’s
Mike Sawtelle the 12-11 victory,
tying the team score at 18.

At the heavyweight position, the
first scoring ofthe match came in the
second period when Dan Kasper-
koski ( l-4) escaped from WVU‘s Bill
Nye. In the third period, Nye
escaped early to tie the score and set
up a takedown battle that ended
with Nye’s pulling in a two-pointer
at the edge of the mats for the 4-2 &
win and a 21-18 West Virginia
victory.

“This week showed us a lot of
things. We got better as we went
along, gained confidence and got
some experience that will be import-
ant at the end of the year at EWL‘s
and nationals," said Stottlemyer.

The Panthers’ next home match is
not until Feb. 18, when Clarion
comes to town, giving Pitt a streak
of eight away matches beginning on
Wednesday when the team travels to
Cleveland State for an Eastern
Wrestling League match-up. The
Panthers are currently 1-1 in EWL
competition.

‘Colas, Kingdom set marks at (INC

By Charlie O’Hara
The Pitt News

The Panther track team, in their
first performance in over a month,
dominated the John Hilton Track

g Classic held Saturday on the campus

of the University of North Carolina.

Led by junior Roger Kingdom
and senior Todd Colas, the Panthers
captured six first places on their way
to the outstanding team award.

“I'm extremely pleased," Panther
coach John Vasvary said. “The
team's effort was a lot like last sea-
son‘s at VMI [Virginia Military
Institute]. Our guys began to realize
just how important every point is.
They came together as a team quite a
bit.”

Pitt was chosen over North Carol-

‘» ina State, returning Atlantic Coast

Conference champions, North
Carolina, East Carolina, Richmond
and several private clubs.

Kingdom was selected outstand-
ing sprinter for his efforts in the 50-
and 60-yard hurdles. He won both
events. In the 60-yard test, his 7.22
clocking established meet and Field
House records.

Colas garnered the distance
runners’ oustanding performance.
award as he also set new meet and
Field House record for the 1,000-
yard performance.

His 2110.7 clocking erased the’
former record held by Tony Waltrip,
who still holds the record for the
most consecutive sub-four-minute
miles.

The Panthers won the distance
medley relay in 10:15.8. Colas
anchored with a strong mile leg.
Alan Laws, Tim Manes and Bill
Moorhead teamed with Colas for
the victory. '

Sophomore Rich Baderinwa, one
of Pitt’s top sprinters, missed the
weekend's competition with a slight
strain in his calf. Baderinwa should

be ready for competition this
weekend.
Other Panther winners were

Manes in the 880-yard run (l:54.6),
with senior Garland Brown taking
second (l:54.8). Senior Torn Bailey
captured the three-mile in 15:08.6.

“This is a good meet for us," Vas-
vary said. “We still have to work
with our normal weaknesses [the
field team, the longer distances and
the overall team's youth], but we
have what appears to be a strong
team on the track.

“There are a lot of positive signs.
Everyone was competitive, and we

had a lot of nice wins — with King-
dom and Colas all the way to senior
Tom Bailey, who won his first colle-
giate race. It’s just the kind of meet
performance we needed at this point
of the season.” ,

This weekend, the Panthers travel

This past weekend, the Lady
Panther track team participated
in the Ohio State University invi-
tational in Columbus, Ohio. “We
did OK. Our biggest problem
was that a lot of the girls got sick
because of the water in Ohio,”
said Coach Elbert Kennedy.

Considering that only six par-
ticipants made up the team, it
was a good effort. Lady Panther
junior Renee Henderson per-
formed well in her events. She
qualified for the NCAA Cham-
pionship trials in the 55-meter
dash on the first day of the meet
with a time of 6.9 seconds, which
also broke the meet and field
house records. In the finals on
the next day, she took third place
with a time of 7.2. She also got a
first place in the 300—meter dash
and joined teammates Sue Torre,

Felicia Blake and Edith Butler
on a 4x400-meter relay second-
place win.

Henderson qualifies
for nationals at Ohio

The 4x200-meter relay
resulted in a disqualification
because runners, violated the
passing zone. Gail Counts, who
runs the second leg in this relay,
“still lacks aggressiveness," the
coach said.

Other winners were Butler in
the 400-meter dash with a time of
57.4 and Blake who set a new Pitt
Record (l.l7.0) in the 500-meter
run. Long distance runner Amy
DiFrancesco failed to place in
any of her events.

This coming weekend, the
Lady Panthers are heading to
East Tennessee University for‘
the Eastman Kodak Invitational.
Kennedy said Butler and Blake
are definitely going; Henderson
and Counts are possibilities.

Kennedy stressed that their
performances will depend on
their attitudes. “It all depends on
their attitudes about their com-
petition, being super competi-
tors, and without any excuses,”
he said.

Shepherd discovers di

ByJoeZ¢ff
ThePlttNews

Things have certainly changed
since Darryl Shepherd last stepped
onto the court for a Pitt-Duquesne
matchup. That was two years ago;
when Shepherd was the Dukes’ ton
freshman, just minted from Pea-
body High School in Pittsburgh.

He scored l7 points as Duquesne
whipped the Panthers at Fitzgerald
Field House 72-62. The-Dukes hav
not defeated Pitt since. ‘

After a sensational season, She-

After a sensational season, Shep-

 herd transferred=W0U1db6f0rC€dt0

sit out a season, Shepherd changed
his allegiance to the crosstown rival,
who was ascending to the Big East
Conference.
Ever since, Shepherd has fallen
from the spotlight to the bench.
He didn’t budge from that bench

when the two foes met at the Golden
Triangle Classic in December. The
6-5 sophomore forward opposed his
ex-teammates for the first time Sat-
urday night —— for all of four
minutes.

I At ll:44 of the first half, Shep-

‘herd stepped in for Clyde Vaughan,»

tossed in two free throws and soon
found himself back on the bench
bench again.

Yet Shepherd is a forebearing
young man. The Pitt media guide
says that he is probably the team’s
most gifted athlete -- his verti'cal
leap is an astounding 42 inches —
but he averages just two and a half

minutes per game. He accepts his

role at Pitt, hoping that someday he
can gain the playing time he gave up
at Duquesne.

“Yeah, sure, I could be at
Duquesne starting," Shepherd said
after the game, “but when l was
there, I realized that the fan support
is very important, and l didn’t have

much ofthat at Duquesne. Also, the
exposure wasn‘t as good as it is
here."

The exposure of the Big East has
its pitfalls, as many young Panthers
have learned. Shepherd joins tal-
ented players like Marlon Ferguson
and Jeff Robinson, both high school
All-Americas, on the Panther side-
line awaiting an opportunity.

“I feel that next year, 1 have a
chance to start - when Clyde
Vaughan‘s gone,” said Shepherd,
while Vaugffan fielded reporter’s
questions in one corner of the locker
room.

“You know, it’s a chance, it’s not
for sure, but I have a chance to start
for two years in the Big East. That‘ll
be a great thing.”

Even though two seasons have
passed since. Shepherd was at
Duquesne, Dukes senior Andy Sis-
inni thought it still a sight to see his
ex-teammate in blue and gold
sweats.

“it seemed weird because I
remember him having such a good
game at Pitt his freshman year. Just
seeing him out there was definitely
strange."

Sisinni said that there is no anim-
osity between his teamand Shep-
herd for his decision to jump ship.

"He felt it was the best move for
him, and there was a shakeup in our
program. No one was sure of what
was going to happen, so, you know,
he went with what he felt was best."

Duquesne continues to provide
vivid memories for Shepherd as well
as spur anxieties.

“I think my adrenalin pumps a
little bit harder when its Duquesne
over there because 1 know that if we
had lost that game, 1 would have had

‘to be answering questions until next

year.”

But as it turned out, Pitt coach
Roy Chipman used Shepherd spar-
ingly, and his teammates fielded all
the questions after the game In the

fferences between rivals

locker room.
Chipman inserted Shepherd into

the game with four minutes left and

Pitt ahead by l4 points, but the

sophomore drew two personal fouls ’

in less than a minute and returned to
the bench.

“I just wanted to give him a
chance to play,”Chipman said, reas-

suring that his decision had nothing

to do with Shepherd’s past. “He's
been playing fairly well, and he did a
nice job up at Boston College.

“We were holding onto the ball
[today], and that’s maybe not the
situation to put Shep in there. He's
got to run and flow, and I think he
was really tight because we were try-
ing to hold the ball at that time.”

Sisinni said that Duquesne was
even tighter when Shepherd was on
the floor and added that Shepherd‘s
presence on the Duquesne bench
may have changed the outcome Sat-
urday night.

continuedfrom P089 ‘We've

don’t care if you're playing sisters of
the poor or UCLA.”

What pleased him most, though,
was the Panthers’ poise overall.

“What I like most about our
play...is that we had 46 shots and
made 23,“ Chipman continued.
“Then when we went to the line, the

. guys didn‘t shoot the ball wildly or

take ill-timed shots. They weren't
throwing the ball around.“

All of which leads up to tonight’s
all-time, all-world clash with St.
John's. Tipoff scheduled for 8 p.m.
in the Field House, Pitt will be pok-
ing around for its first Big East vic-
tory in coach Lou Carnesecca‘s
Redmen. An opportune moment it
won’t be for Chipman, whose 9-4,
0-3 Panthers will be facing a St.
John‘s team that is H-2, 2-! after
losing a close one to Boston College
69-67 Saturday.

“I hate to play St. John’s in a criti-
cal game," Chipman said. “Before
the loss against Boston College, they
were in the Top l0. This isn‘t exactly
the type of team to get better on.
And if we don’t play better than
today, that’s not going to help us.”

After the Panthers lost their
conference-opener to BC 10 days
ago 8|-77, Watkins is weighing the
effect of St. John’s latest loss on
tonight’s encounter.

“We felt like when we went up to
Boston College, we could have beat
them,” Watkins said. “If [the loss]
affects them like it affected us, that’s
a plus for us."

For Watkins, a win tonight could .

quell some rumors that were only
temporarily subdued against
Duquesne.

“The word around campus is that
we’re the ‘Bad News Panthers.’ We
can beat the lollipops, but when it
comes time for the big -games, we
can’t pull [the win] out.”

The tugging will resume tonight.

Panthers lull Dukes to sleep, 72- 6

By  A. Sindler
The Pitt l‘l_ews

Nowhere evident on the court

Saturday evening, the sixth man"

pulled victory from obscurity in
Pitt’s clash with Crosstown nemesis
Duquesne. Don’t believe anything
else to the contrary.

Loo.king to avert a four-game los-
ing spell, the Panthers relied on I9
key points from forward Clyde
Vaughan in the first half to forge a
75-69 victory over the Dukes before
a soldout Fitzgerald Field House
crowd of 6,586.

Prior to the teams’ second meet-
ing this season, though, Vaughan
was not expected to play after
spraining his ankle at Villanova. A
23-point performance, which
launched him into fourth place on
Pitt’s all-time scoring list ahead of
Sam Clancy, cast doubt on the sev-
erity of the sprain.

Vaughan claimed he was in pain
before and after the game. It was
what Dr. Jerry Chessin did for him
Saturday that left Vaughan hypnot-
ized, putting out of thought that
which was out of mind.

“The ankle, it’s sore right now,”
Vaughan admitted two nights ago.
“Dr. Chessin got out of bed real
early this morning and worked with
me after practice and before the
game. He took the pain out of my
mind. The mind is a powerful thing;
he helped me totally forget about my
ankle.”

Chessin, a Slippery Rock Univer-
sity professor, has been hypnotizing
Pitt basketball stars for four years,
20 overall.

“Clyde was all right to play,” Pitt
basketball coach Roy Chipman con-
firmed. “It was a situation where he
plays or doesn't play at all. If he
stayed out [for two minutes, second
half], then the ankle stiffens up.”

“I figured if I could walk, I’d play
38 minutes,” said Vaughan, who
also grabbed seven rebounds. “If I
could have walked in Villanova, I
would have played. It was an intense
game, two great teams were playing
out there.”

In the first half, Duquesne looked
as intense as a simmering pot roast.
Jumping out to a quick, 14-4 lead
mostly on jumpers by Vaughan and
guard Curtis Aiken, the Panthers
seemed on their way to handing
Duquesne its eighth loss in I2
games.

Five minutes later, Dukes coach
Jim Satalin had himself a 23-22 lead
after inserting his leading scorer,
Emmett Sellers, another production
man not expected to play after
spraining an ankle last week. Sellers
poured in 12 first-half points, but
not before Vaughan teamed with
forward Chip Watkins to put Pitt
ahead 39-3l at intermission.

“We didn't play very aggressively
in the first half," Satalin conceded.
“Of course, Clyde Vaughan didn't
help much. Vaughan shouldn’t have
gotten I0 points in the first half. He’s
a good player, but you can‘t give him
that."

Lady Panther gymnast Karen Martin performed
Saturday against Slippery Rock.

The Panther swimmers and divers squeezed past
Penn State at University Park. The Lady Panthers
were not so fortunate...Page8.

Things didn’t get any more inter-
esting until near the end, except that
Pitt sustained a steady barrage of
points and kept Duquesne at least
nine points off of the lead. At the
5:33 mark, however, memories of
Pitt-Duquesne blood started resur-
facing.

After second guard Joey David
picked up a steal at midcourt, Pitt
ahead 62-51, and drove unob-
structed for two, Duquesne guard
Pat Farrell was called for goaltend-
ing. Satalin’s face turned beet red.
Halfa minute later, Vaughan scored
when Greg Harrison, too, was called
for goaltending-

The climax of it all came with 2: 14
left, when four-year guard Andy Sis-
inni and Pitt center Andre Williams
got into a tussle, Watkins drawing a
technical when he intervened. Willi-
ams failed to convert the one-and-
one, and Satalin failed to
understand the officials’
impartiality.

“They just...,” Satalin paused in
frustration, “no matter what you
say, it comes out as being mis-
construed. Pitt came out to play,
aggressively, and I’m sure the offi-
cials were aware of that beforehand.
The refs would call one then not call
one.

“The game was shaped by the offi-
cials but not determined by the offi-
cials. But they set the tempo."

“There was a mixup ofsome sort,”
said Watkins, who led Pitt with eight
rebounds during the 33 minutes he
played. “[Sisinni] looked like he was
going to hit Andre. So Ijust stepped

in...and I got the technical."
Chipman, nevertheless, expressed
a sigh of relief over the squad's first
win since defeating Illinois State for
the Golden Triangle Classic title
over two weeks ago. The Panthers
converted 50 percent from the field

and their usual 72 percent from the
paint.

“Basically, we won and I'm happy
about that," he said. “It's good to get
a win no matter how you go about
getting it. I was telling the kids I

Shirk ﬂips ’Rock, records

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

The Lady Panther gymnasts, led
by All—America Lisa Shirk’s record
setting performance, overwhelmed
Slippery Rock, l73.25-l6l.45, while
establishing a new team scoring
mark.

Saturday afternoon’s win brings I

Pitt's record to 2-0 as Slippery Rock
falls to 0-1. Pitt’s lady gymnasts
seemed to have an easy time with the
Rockets, winning every event and
coming out on top by a margin of
l2.20, a considerable sum in gym-
nastic circles.

The old team record of l69.3
points which was set last season at
Clarion State University, was erased
with the l73.25 total.

In addition to setting a new per-
sonal record, Lisa Shirk set a new
team all-around mark (37.45) by
scoring a 9.4 in the vault, 9.5 on the
uneven parallel bars, 9.25 on the bal-
ance beam, and a 9.3 in the floor
exercises. Shirk bested her previous
Lady Panther record by one tenth of
a point. She totaled 37.35 against
Clarion State University in Febuary
of 1981.

“Lisa Shirk did an excellantjob,"
Head -coach Donna DeMarino
Sanft said, “and it's only been her
second meet since she’s been out for
a year and a half. What’s real
impressive about her is that she's

consistent and real clean. I mean the
difficulty and all that jazz is up there
but the fact that she’s been hitting
routines the way she has; she‘s had
one fall in two meets, which is really
great."

The superb team effort from top
to bottom accounted for the new
team scoring record. Pitt had three
gymnasts Lisa Shirk, Karen Martin
And Debbie Dabkowski who scored
higher than Slippery Rock’s leading
scorer, Carol Gray.

Karen Martin who has earned the
name K-Mart from her teammates
turned in the second highest total
Saturday scoring a 34.5 all around.

“It helped a lot having great com-
petitors (Babbie Flock and Kristy
Pieters) back in the line up.” Martin
said. “It was their first time back and
they helped take off a lot of the
preasure."

Debbie Dabkowski, a junior,
turned in high marks by scoring
34.25 points, “She’s had three good
meets and Debbie is really on the
go.” Sanft said.

Kelli Coleman, a freshmen, per-
formed a solid exhibition routine on
the balance beam. Coleman received
a score of 8.6 which many in attend-
ance thought was very low for her
performance.

Slippery Rock's team was lead by
Carol Gray who ended the meet with
an all around total of 33.2. But for
much of the meet Gray was not the
center of attention on the Slippery
Rock team. In the uneven parallel

Switch

bars competition, Patricia Pierce fell
from the bars during a swinging
move and fell to the mat landing on
her head and neck.

Pierce was removed from the gym
on a wooden support board and
rushed to a near by hospital by
ambulance. Competition at the meet
was halted for several minutes while
she was attended to, the crowd was
in shock and the Slippery Rock gym-
nasts were in tears.

After Pierce fell many of the gym-
nasts were noticably affected. Pitt’s
Jackie Calderone was the first com-
petitor to perform after the accident.

Calderone did a fine job and
received a score of 8.3, after her per-
formance the meet progressed natu-
rally.

“It shakes ya for awhile, but you
have to shake it of," Shirk said.
“Almost everyone’s done that kind
of a swing. It‘s always going through
your mind. You see her getting car-
ried off on a stretcher and you think
to yourself is this sport worth it.”

“Patty is fine. She has some sore
muscles, so we have to [give her] a
little bit of rest but she will be in a
couple of events next week,” Rocket
coach Linda Spadine said. “Gym-
nasts take a lot of bangs and bruises
but when it comes to the head and
neck you baby it all the way along."

The Lady Panthers will face a
tough Michigan state team next
week end.

Panther sophomore Darryl Shepherd is expe-
riencing difficulty finding playing at Pitt since
his tranferring from Duquesne.;.Page 10.
