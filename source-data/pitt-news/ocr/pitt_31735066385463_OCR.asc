Enrollment limit for summer film classes expanded

By Richard Turgeon
Staff Writer

A recent budgetary decision in
the College of General Studies
and College of Arts and Sciences
has increased the enrollment limit
of Pitt students taking Pittsburgh
Filmmakers courses in the
summer.

“The only limitations for
enrollments in the spring/summer
production courses are those
V which Pittsburgh
Filmmakers will set by staff and
space,” said Lucy Fisher, director
of the film" studies department
and a professor of English.

In CAS, $8,000 a semester for
the fall and winter terms is
allocated for Filmmakers
enrollments. In CGS, this figure is
about $20,000 a year. These funds
set the limit for enrollment in
Filmmakers classes at only 27

» students a semester in CAS and

about 30 for CGS students. Also,
priority for enrollment at the
Filmmakers, an independent
institution, is given to ﬁlm studies
majors and certificate students.

An increased demand for these
courses prompted Peter Koehler,
dean of Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, to propose what he
calls asystem of “income sharing”
for the summer semester.

“I [now] have a budget which

self-regulates because Ishare in

the income. I’m sharing income
that I don’t have in the fall and
winter," Koehler said.

Koehler can use 80 percent of
the students’ summer tuition
toward enrollment in a course at
the Filmmakers. That percentage
nearly covers the school’s cost of
paying the Filmmakers’ fee which
eliminates Pitt’s enrollment
Ceiling. ‘

Setting upthis kind of monetary
system for fall and winter
enrollments is unforeseen in the
future. A

Koehler said, “I have no hope

Hotline available for financial aid

By Sandra Kramer
Staff Writer

State Senator Mike Dawida has
announced that a Financial Aid
Hot Line will be available the
week of Jan 22, through 26
between 5 and 9 p.m. for those in
need of ﬁnancial assistance to
attend college.

The Pennsylvania Association‘
of Student ' Financial Aid
Administrators offers the hot—line
service in connection with the
Pennsylvania Association of
Colleges and Universities and the

‘Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency.

Mary Woodall, the coordinator
for the hot line, said, “This is the
fifth year we have offered this
toll-free service. Last year we
received over 2,100 calls and were
able to help a lot of people."

The service is an effort to ensure
that students and their parents
receive accurate and up-to-date
information on the types of
financial aid that would be
available to them should they
enroll in a college, university or
technical school.

Woodall said, “This time of
year is when a lot of people
apply for ﬁnancial aid. .We’re
hoping people will take

advantage of the hot line.

“People mostly call to inquire A

about general questions regarding
student loans, grants and
understanding the financial aid
application.” » -

Woodall has contacted
Pennsylvania mayors asking them
to declare January as financial aid
month. .

“The cost of education is

continually increasing. I’m very
excited about offering this service.
It’s a worthwhile project,”. she
said. ‘ '

The tol1—free hot line number in
western Pennsylvania is 1-800-
762-1001.

Service projects proposed by IF C

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

A number of service projects to
aid the university and community
were proposed at an ’ Inter-
Fraternity Council meeting held
in the William Pitt Union on
Tuesday evening.

Doug Kelly, a representative
from AT &T , proposed a fund
raiser that would include selling
1ong—distance usage to customers.

As non—profit organizations,
houses would be able to earn 8
percent of the phone bill incurred
by each member signed into the

system.

The Cerebral Palsy Foundation
requested the help of the IFC for
its WTAE telethon on Sunday,
Jan. 21. l

The Health Fair coordinators
also asked the IFC for assistance
on Wednesday, Jan. 24.

It was announced that Triangle
fraternity has been declared

inactive by its national chapter. 8
representatives from .

Two
Sigma Phi Epsilon asked for the
IFC’s support in recruiting
members to restart their fraternity.
V Brent Saunders announced that
rush schedules and pledge rosters

are due before 5 p.m. today.

The ﬁrst—round nominations for
Judicial Board were held this
evening, and although no one
was nominated, second— round
nominations and elections of
_ludicial—Board members will be
held at next week's meeting.

Committee chairmen and
members will be chosen next
week. '

Members will also vote next
week for a new external vice
president, due to a vacancy
created when Bob Falk failed to
meet the academic requirements

demanded by the IFC regulations. .

PPC displays Ruhr photography

By Andrea Bar-czykowski
Staff Writer

Photos of the declining
industrial region of the Ruhr Valley
in West Germany are beLng
displayed in the William Pitt Union
Art Gallery.

The exhibit, presented by the
Ruhr Cultural Foundation and
the Goethe House of New York,
is being hosted by the University

Center for International Studies’
West European Studies Program
and the Pitt Program Council.
Founded on large coal deposits,
the Ruhr Valley is one of the most

important industrial areas in West

Germany. The exhibit, “A Place
Like Any Other, After All? Nine
Photographers Explore the Ruhr, "
shows subjective observations
and personal perceptions of the
region.

The photos are a result of a

special project conducted in 1985. ”

Photographers were asked by
the Ruhr.Cultural Foundation to
capture the image of the Ruhr
area. They show the industrial
and social aspects of the region.

“Basically, it's German art from
an industrial region depicting life
in that region. It struck me as
everyday living of the people

See Art, page 2

at this point that I can change the
fall and winter [restrictions on
enrollments]. I've tried through

the appropriate channels in the .

bureaucracy above me andl have
failed.”

Fisher adds, “When we have
tried in the past to say, ‘Can’t this
money in this case, for these
courses, simply be transferred

[from tuition to the Filmmakersl?’

It is not possible according to the
system."

A possibility suggested by
Fisher for handling the fall and
winter enrollments is that the
student would pay not only tuition

to the university, but also a fee to .

the Filmmakers.

“They cannot pay for it anymore
out of their own pockets,” said
Fisher. “The university decided
that they didn’t want a system [for
fall and winter] where some
people pay and some people
don’t, allowing only enrollments
that they can cover the tuition
money for.

“Many lab courses just charge a

fee,” Koehler said. “But the
university doesn’t like to charge
fees. You do it in chemistry and
music." -

-.

During the fall and winter terms ‘
there are “fixed funds” in the

budgets of CAS and CGS for
funding these courses.

Music of Rossini featured
in Heinz Chapel concert

University musical groups will be performing Pittsburgh’s first
orchestra version of _Italian composer Gioachino Rossini’s
“Petite Messe Solennelle” in early February.

“This piece has never been offered before in the orchestral
version in Pittsburgh, and it is one of the few choral sacred
works that Rossini wrote,” said Professor Don Franklin, who
will be conducting the performance.

The University Choral Society, Heinz Chapel Choir, University
Orchestra and members of the University Opera Workshop are
participating. Franklin said that over 10_() singers, 50 members
of the orchestra and four soloists are involved in the production.

“This is definitely a joint effort and we are all working very V
hard,” said Claudia Pinza, who is the music department’s senior

A capital usefor The V(7all

After weeks of watching Westerners capitalize upon
souvenir sales of the Berlin Wall, East Germany has
decided to get in on the act. ’ I

East Germany has announced that it will begin selling
chunks of the Berlin Wall, using the proceeds for
domestic public-health services and humanitarian pur-

poses.

A report from the official East German news agency
stated that the state-owned Limex-Bau Export-‘Import
firm “is taking over the sale of available original parts of
the Berlin Wall.” Border guards have begun to protect
sections of the Wall. from the hammering of eager
souvenir seekers.

The general manager of the firm said that the company
has struck a deal with a West German firm to market

chunks of the Wall certified as original by East Berlin-

Although the firm is a state-owned one, it’s pleasing to
see that the East German government has ﬁnally found a
productive and humanitarian use for the Berlin Wall.
Also, ironically, the wall which more than any other
symbol of the Cold War illustrated the division between
the East and the West, between communism and capital-
ism, now stands as a piece of merchandise with market-
ing potential for a market-oriented world.

It’s- encouraging to see that the freedom to cross borders
may not be the only freedom that the opening of the
Berlin Wall has spawned.

Soviet cuisine} McGlasnost.?

Now that’s glasnost!

Jan. 31 is the big day in the Soviet Union. On that cold
January day ———- right in the heart of another brisk Russian
winter -‘—— the golden arches of McDonald’s will extend to
the Soviet Union. »

Soviet citizens, who year after year have braved tedious
food lines, will soon be able to stroll into the Moscow
McDonald’s and treat themselves to that luscious Big Mac
sandwich ' that we Americans have come to take for
granted. .

There is a drawback though. While we can purchase a
Big Mac in the United States for under $2, Soviets will
have to cough up $3.25 for that all-beef-patty-on—a-
sesame-seed-bun. A real problem in a country torn by
overall and individual economic strife. S

Nevertheless, we know that our Soviet friends will
enjoy their McDonald’s food. But in the spirit of glasnost,
we must extend a few friendly words of advice: don’t eat
too much of it.

 

Gorby/ media love affair. . .

A little realism with the giddiness, please?  

t In the past few months, inter-
national events, especially those
in Eastern Europe, have left virtu-
ally all spectators breathless.

The world has witnessed the
implosion of dominant Commu-

nist parties in Poland, Czechos1o- S

vakia and the Baltic states; al-
leged portions of the Berlin Wall
now sit in the downtown Horne’s
department store for history and

» geology buffs; and Rumania has

been grappling with a violent
revolution which, so far, has re-
sulted in the firing-squad demise
of tyrant Nicolae Ceausescu-

. Although these events would
suggest that communism cannot
properlyftinction — that despite
all of the pearls of communism,
the shelves are still bare — there
is something stubborn about its
allure that enables it to resist
media censure of the philoso-
phy’s leading overseer, Mikhail
Gorbachev.

Friend-of—the-week Al Belice
put it best when, upon observing
that Gorbachev was Time maga-
zine’s “Man of the Decade,” ex-
claimed, “Jesus, that guy’s winning
everything!” This “award” win-
ning of Gorbachev is the sorry,
ironical truth. It seems that every
time the Soviets decide to do
something they should have done
ages ago, the media and syndi-
cated columnists kowtow to this
man, speculating whether or not
he is the Second Coming of Christ.

The German people tear down
the Wall; Gorbachev is given
praise. A dictator is deposed in
Romania; Gorbachev is credited
for not interfering. Soviet citizens
protest the long waits for inade-
quate food supplies; Gorbachev
is canonized for not firing on his
own people. A Nicaraguan plane
crashes (it was transporting So-
viet-made weapons to anti-demo-
cratic brigands in El Salvador);

» Gorbachev’s hands are immacu-

late. What has this man done to
receive such leniency? George
Will aptly commented that a leader
should not be given great praise
for not killing demonstrators.

Of course if Gorbachev is the
hero, then there must be a villain.
If you’re a devout follower of The
New York Times and The Wash-

 

ington Post op-ed pages, the

V answer is the anti-Communists.
, These dregs of American patriot-

ism have been whooping up anti-
Communist hysteria since the
close of World War II. It still
staggers their ‘minds that we
haven’t had a nuclear war. Cer-
tainly when Ronald Reagan was
elected, the press held their
breath, crossing their fingers for a
Pulitzer Prize-winning story on
some international incident pro-
voked by Reagan’s cowboys.
Well, an invasion, a bombing and
dozens of Pershing-II missiles
later, the world is still. here.
What is really gt shame though
and discredits the liberal media
for ignoring this, is the accuracy

‘ of the anti-Communist “rhetoric.”

The anti-Communists, a category
including the CIA, the Pentagon,
the Reagan Administration and a
few U.S. senators, claimed the
Soviet Union was stockpiling
chemical weapons, unjustiﬁably
fighting in Afghanistan and vio-
lating the ABM and SALT II trea-
ties. The Soviets denied these

allegations and, surprise, surprise,
the media labeled the anti-Com-
munists irresponsible war hawks.
That was then; times change. .

In the fall of 1989, Soviet.

Foreign Minister Eduard Shevard-

‘ nadze admitted, piecemeal, to all

of the accusations listed above.
But instead of an ‘outraged press
trouncing on the Soviets for yet
more lies like they would have
done to a Nixon or a Reagan, they

 "‘Blﬁ%  and

lavished more praise on the for-
eign minister and secretary-gem
eral for ﬁnally coming out of the
closet. The memories of the se-
cretiveness of the Chernobyl
incident were the furthest thing
from their collective minds.

While it must be admitted that
Gorbachev has done things much
differently than his geriatric prede-

cessors, it should be remem- ,

bered’ that it’s being , done 50
years behind the times. Letting
Jews leave the Soviet Union and
freeing political dissidents make
great publicity coups. How can
America compete when they have
no such problems? Keep in mind,

too,that although Gorbachev is ‘

the St. George to Bush’s dragon,
the Soviet leader is not the shin-
ing knight of his 15 republics.
Unfortunately for Comrade Gor-
bachev, felt hats, silk suits, nice
smiles and a lapdog Western press

don’t fill the empty bellies in the“

Ukraine.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 18, 1990.

A fictitious, backward

I was shaking badly as the
Pan Am 747 crawled across the
airﬁeld towards the terminal. I
hadn't “had a cigarette in the
seven hours since the ﬂight left
New York's Kennedy Airport,
and I was gritting my teeth
waiting to get off of the plane
and light up.

It was windy and freezing
cold here in the tiny Eastern
European country of Pomania,
which is cradled in the middle
of the Carpathian Mountains,
which I could see off in the
distance.

As I hurried into the airport
terminal, my first order of
business was to grab a pack of
matches; I couldn't ﬁnd any. I
walked around for a few min-

- utes until I located a fellow
smoker.

Politely, I approached a

. wealthy—looking gentleman and
asked him if he had a match.
He looked at me oddly; I
immediately remembered the
language barrier. I pulled a
cigarette out of my coat pocket
and motioned to him that I
‘needed a light. He smiled,
showing that he understood,
and pulled out a book of
matches, but instead of hand-
ing them to me he held out an
open hand motioning that he
‘wanted something from me.
Thinking perhaps that this was
some sort of Pomanian cus-
tom, I offered him one of my
cigarettes. Looking insulted, he
shook his head and began hol-
lering at me in his own lan-
guage. I pulled one American
dollar b1'it‘of fnyxpocket and
gave it to him, but he still
pointed to his open hand,
suggesting that he wanted
more. This went on for several
dollars. After giving him five
dollars he smiled, politely
tipped his hat and gave me the
book of matches.

I retrieved my baggage and
tried to catch a cab. After waving
my arm furiously for several
minutes a taxi pulled up. I got in
and simply said, “Hilton.”

As I stared out of the window,
I immediately noticed how in-
credibly dark it seemed outside.
Funny, there were no streetlights.
Also, in most of the buildings
there were no lights on. Even in
the dark I could somehow notice
that even during the day the streets
and alleyways which I passed
must seem dark and dreary. The
only things outside of my cab that
caught my eye were the large
banners portraying political fig-
ures hanging on the side of many
of the buildings. Each banner
displayed the ominous hammer
and sickle of the Communist Party.

The newspaper I work for had
sent me to Pomania, the last hard-
line communist stronghold in
Eastern Europe, to interview its
more-than-slightly psychotic dic-
tator, Dickoli Chewycescu. I spent
the next hour or so reviewing my
notes for the following day’s in-
terview. I didn’t know much about
the dictator. Not much news ever
came out of Pomania because the
government controlled the me-
dia. The only thing I did know
about Chewycescu is that many
Pomanians in the States described

,his personality as twisted. I wasn’t
sure what to expect.

I woke up early and, since I had
plenty of time before my appoint-
ment, I decided to walk to the
Presidential Palace on the other
side of town. Everyone seemed

_ _olc,1,, and desolate..

It was a different story when I
reached the large open-market
area, where it seemed the entire
population was located. It seemed
that everyone was screaming at
the top of their lungs at everyone
else and trying to get the best
bargain on whatever it was they
were buying. The whole scenario

  Drastic measures to

News of a new female contra-
ceptive called Norplant. This

. birth—control device is im-
planted in the arm of a woman.
Supposedly, the contraceptive
can prevent pregnancy for up
to five years.

Hey, what a great thing. But
let's not stop there.

Right now, not just in the
United States of America, but
throughout the whole world,
there is a list of dilemmas.
Probably the biggest problem
is a scarcity of resources, which
translates into poverty. We
have deep poverty in many
forms: homelessness, starva-
tion, crime, unemployment,
welfare. All of these situations
are but a byproduct_of pov-
erty. However, this poverty is
not so much due to a scarcity
of resources as it is caused by
an overabundance of people.

' Face it — the world is over-
populated.

This overpopulation is the
main reason for poverty; there
are just not enough resources
to go around. For years we
have tried to produce more
resources in order to meet the

demands of a growing popula-
tion. For years that method has
proven to be ineffective as pov-
erty continues to rise. So instead
of u\i\successfully creating more
resources, let's take steps to con-
trol the ever-increasing popula-
tion.

When I say, “Let's control the
population,” I don’t mean run-
ning around like an anarchist kill-
ing people. How I propose to
control the population is by con-
trolling sexual reproduction. This
could be done by using my friend
and yours, Norplant.

Every woman coming of age
should have to have the Norplant
device implanted in her arm, thus
preventing her from conceiving a
child. Then, when that woman
decides that she is ready to have
a child, she can go fill out an
application stating that she would
like to have a child. That applica-
tion would then be approved or
denied by a judge, caseworker or
someone along those lines. From
that point on, the device could be
removed, and then the woman
would be able to have a child.
After the child was born, the device
would be reimplanted.

nation in a

looked barbaric, like a feeding
frenzy.

When I entered the posh Presi-
dential Palace, I was greeted by a
Pomanian soldier dressed in a
formal green and red uniform.
He was expecting me and mo-
tioned for me to ‘follow him. We
walked through a long hall with
marble pillars rising up to the
high ceiling. The walls were clut-
tered with elaborate tapestries
and large paintings of Russian

 

and Pomanian rulers. At the end
of the hall were two large, wooden
doors which the soldier opened.
He invited me to enter. Dickoli
Chewycescu greeted me with a
smile and a handshake.

“Thank you, sergeant. You are
dismissed,” he said to the soldier.
“Please, sit down. Can I offer you
some Russian vodka?," he asked.
in a friendly voice.

“Yes, thank you," I said. I was
nervous. A drink would do me
good.

“I’m quite impressed with your
surroundings. Your home is quite
beautiful," I said.

“Yes,” he said. “These are the
privileges of being in charge."

“Mr. President, I noticed last
night as I drove from the airport
to the hotel that there were no

streetlights. This seems odd to '

me. Why are there no streetlights?”
- “All of the electricity is turned
off at night; therefore, there is no
need for streetlights.”
“No electricity at night? Why?”
“It is one of the small burdens
the people must bear to help
further communism. But let us
not speak of politics. »Will you

join me for a day out on the
town, as you Americans say?
You can ask me questions as
we enjoy ourselves." 1

Confused, I agreed to his
invitation.

His chauffeur drove up to the
front of the palace in a large,
black Mercedes. Chewycescu
spoke a few words to him and
the chauffeur walked away. He
motioned to me to get into the
car as he sat in the driver's seat.

“Today, it will be just you and
I. I will drive," he said.

As we drove through the city,
the President acted as my tour
guide.

“This is where the people get
their food. This is where the
people get their clothing. This
is where the people get there
toiletries," he pointed out. Each
place he showed me had long
lines of weary people waiting
outside in the bitter cold.

“How do you feel about the
people of Pomania? I mean, are
you fond of them? Are you
concerned about the conditions
they are living in? The long lines
and lack of electricity at night,
for example?” I asked.

“The ‘people? I love my
people!” he said. “But wait! Look
at that!"

A few hundred yards ahead

of us was an elderly woman‘

standing in the middle of the
street. It appeared that she had
dropped her groceries.

“Now we will really have fun,”
he said as our car began accel-
erating.

“What do you mean?" I asked,
horriﬁed.

The old woman bounced and
rolled over the car upon im-

pact. I screamed as the Presi-
dent let forth the most evil laugh
I had ever heard.
I sat silent with my heart
beating quickly as we drove on.
“Relax,” he said, noticing my

  6
W€lI’d, but real world

state. “You Americans just don’t
know how to have a good

time. Come, I will take us to a

place where we can relax.”

We exited the city and drove
into the the foothills of the
Carpathian mountains. He
parked the car on the top of a
tall, grassy hill. It was a beau-
tiful~' place.

' We got out of the car and
walked a few yards until we
cameto a large pasture where
many sheep were grazing
peacefully.

“Come, let me show you my
ﬂock,“ he said. We walked
down the hill into the pasture.

Standing in the middle of the
ﬂock he turned towards me
and said, “Won’t you join me
for a little fun?"

With a suspicious feeling that
he was contemplating some-
thing perverted, I left him alone
in the pasture with the sheep.

I heard the sheep scream as
Iran at a furious pace up the’
hill towards the car. I lit a
cigarette and sat on the ground,
shaking at the horrors I had
just witnessed. Shortly thereaf-
ter, Chewycescu came walk-
ing up the hill whistling “Dixie.”
I got in the car.’He got in the
car. He smelled bad. He lit a
cigarette and smiled deviously.

“We will drive-back to the
Palace now," he said.

I thanked God.

When we drove up to the
Palace he turned to me and
said in a friendly voice, “I will
have my chauffeur drive you

. to your hotel. I must thank you
' for spending the afternoon with

me. I enjoyed myself. I hope
you will write a good story. I
hope your visit has given you
a good idea about what com-
munism is all about.”
“Yes, thank you. It has.”

I know what you’re thinking,
“This is a fascist ploy to keep
poor people and minorities from

sorry, that's wrong. You lose, but
we have nice departing gifts for
you. I’m not trying to erase any
minorities. However, Iwould like
to see any person that is under
the age of 15 not pregnant. I

 

would like to see unmarried, no-
income mothers, whether they
are black, white or purple, not
having two, three or more chil-
dren. I would not like to see
women who snort cocaine or are
not competent enough to raise
children, carrying children.
And I'm not a fascist, I'm a
liberal, darn it! I just think that it's
sad that we have so many un-
planned pregnancies and so
many unwanted children in the
world. I also hate to see people
that are more poor than I am

having children. I also hate to
see people with AIDS and drug
addicts having sick, deformed
children. I hate to see women
needing to have abortions
which, thanks to our govern-
ment, will probably be illegal
soon. And what really makes
my skin crawl and my stomach

_turn are the sick, demented

bastards that have children and
then physically and sexually
abuse them. Those people
should be killed.

Something has got to be done
about these problems. They are
not getting any better; they are
getting worse. The world is being
overpopulated by children who
are unloved, emotionally scarred
for life or raised to be drug
addicts and criminals. Programs
designed to deal with all of the
problems I have listed are fail-

pumped into these programs
are going nowhere. Whether
we like it or not, some type of
method to prevent these prob-
lerns is going to have to be
implemented eventually. Why
not do it now? I

This idea if put to work would

keep people from having chil-
dren that don’t want them,
aren’t ready for them, aren’t
able to take care of them, or
aren’t worthy to have them.

having coronaries, and femi-
nists are jumping up and down
on their hairy legs right now,
butI think it's insane that there
are girls in this world that
aren’t old enough to buy beer,
to vote or to drive a car, yet are
having children. I also think
that it's sad that there are
people out there that aren’t
competent enough to take care
of themselves, but are having
children. I think it's sick that
there are people out there that

SI writer Telander discusses corrupt college football

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Rick T elander just wants to see
things done right.

A Sportslllustratedsenior writer
for eight years, Telander had to
walk away from the sport he
once loved. The corruption,
hypocrisy and disappointment
which he discovered through
writing about a game which was
supposedly so good and pure
and was really a gross facade,
was too much of a burden to
bear.

In his book, 7beHundred Yard
Lie, Telander examines the faults
of college football and proposes
his own solution as to how the
game can emerge and survive

‘ without all its corruption.

Given the incidents over the
years involving athletes and
universities in recruiting
violations, drugs and assaults, a
sizeable portion of the American
public is not surprised when it
hears of recurring incidents. In
other words, the public is well
aware of some of the corruption,
but perhaps not to its full extent.

“I think I've outlined the
thoughts that people are having
about the wrongdoing in college

football, and I've outlined a plan

to solve a lot of it, and I don't see‘

what's so crazy about its
implementation,” Telander said.

“I saw the kind of people the
[college football] system was
creating because of its hypocrisy.
People like Deion Sanders, Tony
Mandarich, Hart Lee Dykes: guys
with their hands out trying to
take everything they could,
Blatant mercenaries.

“Because the system wasn’t
fair to them, they tried to use the
system by being a fraudulent
student or taking under-the-table
payments or by just saying ‘Yeah,
I'm just here to prepare for the
NFL,”’ Telander added.

The numerous and highly
publicized incidents involving
college football players and
drugs, shootings and rapes were
the breaking point for T elander.
He walked away from a top
position at the world’s most
prestigious sports magazine
because of what he was seeing
and experiencing off the playing
ﬁeld.

“Those incidents were the
turning point for me. All the stuff
that occurred at South Carolina
with all the steroid abuse, and
Oklahoma with all the numerous

arrests. Charles Thompson being
arrested for selling cocaine to FBI
agents; Jerry Parks shooting his
teammate and then almost killing
himself. And then the alleged
gang rape down there,” T elander
said.

“It was too hard to write about
the game because I was always
writing about ethics and morals
and crime.”

And he wants to make sure
people know what is happening
in the real world of college
football.

“College football has no real
purpose on a college campus; it’s
not part of college. Its purpose is
contradictory to the notion of
being a real student,” he said.

Telander believes that many
players are simply playing college
football because that is all they
want to do with their lives, and
college is the only place to play
big-time football when one is
between 18 and 21. He thinks
there is nothing wrong with this
way of thinking, but that this type
of attitude must be acknowledged
and treated as such.

“The corrupt elements [of
college football] are that
amateurism has some validity in

Pitt gymnast Pollaci’s
experience puts him
in leadership position

By Sharon Kerestes
For The Pitt News

Athletes and nicknames seem to go together. Here at Pitt we’ve
heard names like “Ironhead” Heyward and “Swervin”’ Curvin Richards.
Pitt gymnast Pat Pollaci knows about nicknames, too. His teammates
call him “Pops,” and their reasoh is much like that of the former
Pittsburgh Pirates who gave the same name to Bucs’ slugger Willie
Stargell.

As the oldest and most experienced gymnast on the team, Pollaci
naturally falls into the role of leader.

“We definitely look to him as a leader," said sophomore Stuart
Yoss. “He’s like a father.”

Pollaci’s teammates aren’t the only ones who see him in that role.
His tendency to motivate others is much relied on by Coach Frank
D’Amico.

“In the gym I expect help from him, help in the way of motivating
individuals,” he said. I've expected it from him from last year. He's
been with me the longest for that respect, so he should understand
me the most.”

The 21-year-old Long Island, N.Y., native doesn’t mind the role or
the responsibility that comes with leadership, but he said there are
pressures involved.

“I have to perform really well.  If I'm going to tell somebody to
do something, I have to be willing to do it myself," he said. He added
that he likes the pressure because it motivates him to keep going.

D’Arnico counts on Pollaci as a more mature athlete to teach by
setting an example. He hopes that Pollaci’s persistent and patient
style in practice will rub off on some of his younger athletes.

“He gets upset and frustrated like everyone,” D’Arnico said. “[But]
he’s a little more reserved than most people.”

“He never ﬂies off the handle," said teammate Damon DiFabio,
which may be one of the reasons he sees Pollaci as a more “strong,
silent type of team leader.”

Pollaci himself is unsure of how his teammates see him. “I would
hope that it’s as somebody that they can rely on,” he said.

the world of sport, which [is
false]; it’s a false concept. And the
second thing is that these athletes
can and want to be students.

“You’re forcing them into a
system that they may not want to
be involved in just so they can
play football. And saying that
we’re going to have to continue
to deal with their test grades and
education  actually has nothing
to do with what we really want

. from them, which is to entertain

us,” Telander said.
Anotherelement in the fraud is

that people do not really care

about the mental fitness of the

athletes whose main job it is to
play football.

“Nobody asked Albert Einstein
what his 40-yard-dash time was.
And it didn’t detract from his
theories that he wasn’t a great
athlete, that he was probably
physically unﬁt.

“The fact that a great football
player may be mentally unﬁt in
certain ways is irrelevant also if
he can play the game,” he said.

Telander does not fault the
athlete but instead accuses the
system of breeding cheating
inside the NCAA and inside
universities themselves.

to do. And to win, he’s got to
have players who can do things
that are not in keeping with the
institute of higher education’s
policies, plus bring players onto
campus who should not be there.
That has to happen,” Telander
said.

“The cycle of probation and
winning is endless. As long as
winning is the main goal, which
it should be, you've got to do
those things.”

So how do you change all of
this?

Telander has come up with a
plan that essentially states that
college football teams should be
owned by the university, just as
they are now, but the teams
shouldbe financial entities whose
main objective is proﬁt-making,
“which it is anyway,” according
to Telander.

A new league called the Age
Group Professional Football
League would be established, a
league somewhat ‘similar in
conoe pt to baseball ’s minor league
teams. The league would receive

partial subsidy from the NFL,
which would place a guaranteed
sum of money into a yearly pool
for the AGPFL’s use.

Players need not be college
students, but must have a high
school diploma or its equivalent.
Players would be paid, and the
teams that they play for will carry
the mascots and colors of their
sponsoring schools. The league
would have a drug-testing
program similar to that of the
NFL.

Universities that do not desire
affiliation with the AGPFL could
keep their football programs, but
could not charge admission to
games or use their teams as a
moneytmaking enterprise, and
would be termed “college football
teams.”

Everything would still

essentially be the same. The fans
could still have their tailgate
parties and Saturday afternoon
games; we would still have the
Pitt Panthers with the same colors,
schedule and stadium, and the
NFL would still have something

to draft from.

“What are we losing? The
athletes won't have to be these
fraudulent students, but the
NCAA is a tremendous
impediment to change because
all of these bureaucrats would

find themselves out of a job

under a new system. Other than
that, I don’t see what’s so wild
and crazy about the things I’m
suggesting,” Telander said.

Telander will now go on to
cover boxing and the NBA for
Sports Illustrated. Why boxing?

“It’s sort of like my penance. I
expect every guy to have been
in prison. And I expect every
guy to be an uneducated or a
bad person.

“So if I meet one along the
way who's authentic and real
and a decent human being, my
spirits will soar; instead of
covering college football which
is supposed to be clean and
pure and idealistic and it's
nothing but exploitation and
abuse.”

The Pittsburgh Bulls traveled
to Philadelphia last Saturday to
face the defending Major
Indoor Lacrosse League
champion Wings. The Wings,
led by the 1989 MILL leading
scorer Brad Kortz, are favored
to retain their title for 1990.
They improved their chances
and their undefeated record
with an 11-8 win over the
Bulls. The Wings are now 2-0,
and the Bulls dropped to 1-1.

In front of an audience of
16,101 fans, the Wings played
an excellent defensive game to
hold the Bulls to eight goals‘.
However, they played a much
stronger game offensively than
they did ‘ against the New
England Blazers. The Bulls
scored 14 goals against New

Pittsburgh drops to 1-1
with loss to the Wings

England.

Wings goaltender Kevin
Bilger held the Bulls leading
scorer Brian Nikula to two
goals. Uncharacteristically,
Bulls goalie Bruce Donaldson
was not as strong as he was
against the Blazers even though
he gave up the same amount
of goals.

Gary Becker, Mark Gold and
Patrick O'Connor each had a
goal for the Bulls. Butch Marino‘
contributed a hat trick.

The Bulls are earning an
infamous reputation as the “bad
boys" Of the MILL. There were
a number of fights in the game
against Philadelphia with each
team amassing over 20 minutes
in penalties.

The Bulls will attempt to
increase their record to 2-1 this
weekend in Detroit against the
Turbos.

Hockey club keeps first place

By Rob Codlspot
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther hockey club
now looks forward to a busy
weekend after upping its Western
Pennsylvania College Hockey
Association record to 5-1 by
maintaining control of first place
with a 5-4 win at Allegheny
College on Saturday. Carnegie
Mellon is a close second with a 7-
2 slate.

The Panthers are now 7-3
overall and play at West Virginia
University on Saturday at 4 p.m.
and at Golden Mile Ice Center on
Sunday at 5 p.m. for an Allegheny
rematch.

In the first Allegheny game,
Pitt quickly jumped out to a 3-0
lead against Allegheny in the first
period. Skating with a man
advantage, Tony T ravato took a
pass from defenseman Eugene
Barilla, skated into the Allegheny
zone and fed Mark Granatire at
the right circle. Granatire took

care of the rest, his wrist-shot
finding the back of the net and
giving the Panthers a 1-0 lead.
f Soon after, Mike Cuchran
snatched up the rebound off a
have Koval slapshot and scored
to give Pitt a 2—O cushion. The
game had all the makings of a
blowout when Bill Crousey
controlled the puck from behind
the Allegheny net and threaded a
pass to Barilla between the circles.
_Bari1la walked in unscathed,
beating the Allegheny goalie with
a wrister between the legs,
making it 34) Pitt. I
R But Allegheny, behind the
spectacular efforts of its
goaltender, roared back, scoring
four of the next five goals.
Meanwhile, Pitt was pelting the
Allegheny net with shots, with
only Granatire able to put one
home. Mike Q’Conor, John
Carlins and Granatire worked a

3-on-2 break to perfection, Carlins
fed Granatire for the goal.

Pitt out-shot Allegheny 44-22.

“If it weren’t for Allegheny’s
goalie, it would’ve been much
worse,” Barilla said. “He was like
a brick wall after the first period.
He made some great saves.”

But he didn’t quite make
enough of them. With the score

knotted at 4-4, Bill Crousey. A
deflected a Brian Woyt shot out ‘

of the air and into the net to give
Pitt the final 5-4 margin with 3:17
remaining.

“We had so many shots; it was r

just a matter of time before we
scored,” Barilla said.

Pollaci

Continued from page 7

‘ Pollaci said he deﬁnitely thinks
the team’s closeness away from
competition helps them to deal

with problems in the gym.
“Frank and [assistant coach]
Jorge Sanchez are there for
coaching reasons, and they’ll help
out if they see a problem going
on,” Pollaci said. “But it’s more
evident to me when I see
something wrong personally. I
think it’s a little bit easier for me

‘ as a close friend to get them
i going." -

This is Pollaci’s last year as a

' competitor,‘ but since he’ll be

here next year to complete his
engineering degree, D’Amico has
considered him as a possible
assistant.

“If he were to become an
assistant coach next year, I don’t
see that there would be any
problems on the team,” D’Amico
said. “They already respect him
for what he is."

Pollaci said he would like to
help out in the gym if the position
was available.

“If I had the chance, I would
deﬁnitely want to assistant coach.
I’m going to be around for another
year, and gymnastics isn’t

something you can just walk away
from,” he said.

In terms of ability, many look
to Pollaci as the team’s best. With
an all-around personal best of
53.05, D’Amico won’t argue.

“I would probably put him on
top,” he said. “He’s a good,
consistent worker. There are some
guys on the team who can push
him in some of the events.”

Pollaci began gymnastics when
he was very young but didn’t
become serious until he wasin
high school. As a senior he was
the New York state champion on
ﬂoor exercise and placed second

Federation junior nationals meet
Accomplishments like these
mean a great deal to Pollaci, but
he says he has benefited most
from what gymnastics has done
for him as a person.

“Gymnastics has done a lot for
me as far as discipline,” he said.
It’s also made me abetter person.
I’ve met a lot of people, and I've
been inﬂuenced by a lot of
people. Once it’s gone, it's gone.
I’m cherishing every moment I

The Creatures: Siouxsie and one of the Bansbees

 

The Creatures
Boomerang
Geffen

The ice queen and her anaemic
consort are back to bafﬂe and
bedazzle you. Last time it was
from the islands of Hawaii; this
time it’s via Cadiz, Spain.

Siouxsie Sioux and Budgie
have again wandered into the
depths of a foreign culture to
extract a spicy sound that will
leave you wondering if there
will ever be a niche created that
this duo will fit into.

The Creatures are an offspring

 

Siouxsie.

of the English band Siouxsie
and the Banshees. It is the
petulant lead singer and the
stone-faced drummer, the only
members of the old band, that
dare the listener a raised eyebrow
or a shout of delight.

One minute you’ll hear
marirnba; the nextminute you’re
on Pluto setting up house. One
moment it’s a harmonica belting
out a bluesy train whistle that
would make Muddy Waters
proud, and the next moment it’s
an accordion speeding into a’
psychedelic frenzy. Boomerang
will leave you gasping for breath

and checking your foothold.

With so many expectations of

the “punk,” “new wave” and
“progressiveness” of Siouxsie
and the Banshees, the Creatures
seem to be a cathartic orgy of
musical backgrounds and
genres; an all-out experimental
sound stimulus.

Their first album, Feast, was a
study of steamy Hawaiian beats.
The multi—talented Budgie
explored the rhythmic, ritualistic
sounds of the islands while Sioux
breathed, belted and sighed on
the tracks to create a rich tapestry
of songs.

Boomerangis a gypsy’s tour of
Spain, showing a plethora of
facades and a totally
unpredictable side of itself where
Sioux is a chameleon and Budgie
is an explosion.

Boomerang is similar to the
feeling of falling when you are
asleep; you have to catch yourself
before you fall into a deep abyss:
It confuses you and sends you
back to the shore for some grasp
of familiarity.

Sioux is ever—constant with her
haunting and ethereal poetry.
Her voice has matured greatly
since her stint with the Sex Pistols,

and she now shows off her
incredible range of capabilities
in a forum of swirling insanity.

Budgie seems to be a bit
more exploratory than Sioux
by having his furious drumming
releases at certain points and

then slowing to a hypnotic pace I

at other times.

For Siouxsie fans, it’s
definitely a far cry from join
Hands, and for the new fans,
Boomerang is a carnival of
colors, lights and sound. For
both, it’s a trip to a tragically
weird place.

4th Annual AM Jam Tattoo Exposition

By Tim Azinger
Showcase Editor

SCHENECTADY, NY — This is
the fourth year for the Am Jam
Tattoo Exposition which is the
offspring of the tattoo contest
held during the spring each year
at the Am Jam Motorcycle
Jamboree. Tattooing as an art has
come into its own. It’s getting
more press, growing in
popularity, and numerous tattoo
conventions are held annually.

Schenectady itself resembles
Pittsburgh; for the most part it’s
industrially dead. Once a thriving
town built around the General

Electric Company, as with most
other industries, business has
slowed and most of the town is
scattered with old warehouses,
their broken windows reflecting
the mid—winter sun. (All this
pertinent information came from
an elderly gentleman, who I
believe is the owner of the
Ramada Inn we stayed at. I met
him in the Jacuzzi on Saturday
night.)

Incidentally, the tattoo
conventioners had the pleasure
of sharing the Ramada facilities
with D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse
Rehabilitation Education), who
was also having its annual

meeting. It made for an eclectic
evening: drinking beer in the hot
tub with some of the world’s best
tattooists and the Schenectady
chief of police. Alcohol
Jacuzzis do not mix, and I
remember him babbling
something about Mr.
Westinghouse originally being
from Schenectady. But the booze
and bubbling water clouded my
hearing, so I just ‘nodded when I

and‘

’ felt it was appropriate.

Held in I.U.E Hall on Jan. 13
and 14, the convention itself is a
tattoo lovers’ smorgasbord: all
the inked flesh and sexy leather
outﬁts you'd care to feast your
eyes on. The preferred color is
black (leather of course), and
long hair, beards and breath rank
with Marlboro smoke, and Busch

-beer abounds.

And yet, you’re not required to

be a biker to be admitted. There
were plenty of "normal" looking
people, some with tattoos, some
without. My favorite was the mom
and dad couple taking in the
sights, dad with his three- year-
old son on his shoulders.

This is not to say that there
weren’t any particularly strange
individuals in attendance. It’s
times like those that make you

Tattoo

Continued from page 4
feel almost naked when

compared to the folks with well
over 75 percent of their body
covered with tattoos. There were
those that take the body
decoration to an even higher
plane with tons of earrings, nose
rings, nipple rings, rings in their
eyelids, lips and various other
body parts. Just use your
imagination.

The convention itself hosts a
leather fashion show (instead of
taking the customary bow, one
voluptuous model bared her
breasts, and the rest followed suit
in what turned into a “you—show-
me—yours-I’ll-show-you-mine”
competition) and a variety of
tattoo contests. But the bulk of
the convention center is covered
with booths, some selling leather
wear and jewelry, but the majority
(28) of the booths house tattooists
from all over the country. Some
of this year's better- known artists
included Dan Williams, Gill
Montie, Shotsie and the infamous

   

Spider Webb and his outlaw band
of tattooing wonders.

For over 12 hours each day
these artist were inking their best
work into the tattoo— hungry fans.

Saturday night and all its water-
centered activities became
increasingly tense as the tattooed
masses began retiring to the
Ramada for the evening’s
entertainment. Bewildered
parents snatched their children
from the pool when the tattooed
army, outfitted in swimming
trunks and knee—high Harley
boots, marched into the recreation
room.

possibilities life can deliver. The
play opens with a scene picturesque
family life. Rachel wriggles excitedly
as she exclairns to her husband,
Tom (Iim Abele), of her unspeakable
happiness. “I’m having one of my
euphoria attacks.” He responds by
announcing that he’s taken a contract
out on her life. Now, this could
really ruin a perfectly good day,
wouldn’t you say?

Feeling a delayed regret, T om
helps Rachel, in bathrobe and
slippers, through a window and into
the snow. Thus begins Rachel’s
journey through a dimension where
every day is Christmas and every
town is named Springfield.

Feeling a tad bit jaggered, Rachel
stumbles through the snow where
she happens upon Lloyd (Will
Osborne), a traveler looking for gas.
After quick conversation, Lloyd
invites Rachel to stay at his home
with his paraplegic wife, Pooty
(Elizabeth Loftus), who also pretends
to be deaf in order to secure Lloyd’s
love and attention.

Then we learn that Lloyd isn’t the
saint he appears to be. He is living
under an assumed name, for he
walked out on a woman with
multiple sclerosis and two children.
A drunken Lloyd ran over one of the
children with a snow blower leaving
him brain damaged. He then stole
$35,000 from their savings account

 ' to put himself through school. In

order to paybackthermeft, the three

of them (Lloyd, Pooty and Rachel)

appear on the game show “Your
Mother or Your Wife.” Pooty passes

. as Lloyd’s mother, while Rachel

poses as his wife.

At yet another Christmas
celebration, Pooty and Rachel’s
returned husband, Tom, die from a
sip of poisoned champagne. Rachel
and Lloyd ﬂee frantically. Rachel
stammers through life in disbelief,
taking herself through a line of
psychiatric help (all six doctors
played by Marion McCorry).

Meanwhile, Lloyd ﬁzzes out on
champagne, drinking himself to
death. Rachel lands in a madhouse,
also bereft of speech. Her analyst
puts her on a talk show to release
her from the delusion that someone
is trying to kill her. On TV, the

,.M.maan

?"' ‘

attempt is made on her life, though ‘"5’

the bullet intended for her lodges in
the forehead of the guest personality.

So ends the twist of fate on Rachel’s
life. Well, nearly. Finally, she ends

up on the other side of the chair and
finds herself giving psychiatric
counseling to Tom _]r., her long-lost
son. Yup, that’s it. Like the whole
play, we are left to wonder, as one

of Rachel’s psychiatrists suggests, ifs;

it’s all a dream. Sure, this dark
comedy resembles little to what we
think is really possible, but then
again, “Things just happen.”

Reckless will be showing at The
Pittsburgh Public Theater through

Even Tom Cruise's
astonishingly intense and moving
performance as Vietnam veteran
and political activist Ron Kovic

‘) cannot carry a film as
disappointing as Oliver Stone’s
(Platoon, Wall Street) disjointed
Born on the Fourth of July. The
film was edited from over 83

hours of footage to produce two
hours and 37 minutes, and it
shows. Just when the story begins
to introduce characters or become
involving, the time and setting
quickly change again with Cruise
as our only link to each scene.
The movie quickly marches
through Kovic’s life, beginning
with scenes from his childhood
and ending with his address to

scenes of Kovic’s conservative,
middle-class upbringing to the
horrors of the Vietnam War and
the Bronx Veteran's Hospital. The
rest of the ﬁlm follows Kovic’s
physical and emotional
rehabilitation with the last half-
hour dealing with his political
activism.

Although we’re introduced to
everyone in the film, we never
get to know certain characters or
why they’re even there. The
“romance” between Kovic and
childhood sweetheart Donna
(Kyra Sedgwick), as well as
Kovic’s relationships with other
supporting characters, is set up
either to tell us little about Kovic

abandoned. The result is like

remarkable but unrelated scenes
with little contribution to character
development or to a logical
progression of the plot.

Much like Platoon, Born on the
Fourth of July is a ﬁlm that
practices no restraint. Stone’s bold
and effective habit of unmercifully
rubbing theviewer’s face in the
dirt seems too purposeﬁil and
unnecessary in a story where it so
obviously belongs. Because the
movie never firmly places the
viewer in the story, these scenes
serve as nothing but images that
are memorable for their visceral
shock value rather than for their
emotional content.

Stone’s talent as a director and
Cruise’s as a performer don’t save
the ﬁlm from its lingering banality,

cast is excellent. The
cinematography is superb, with
Kovic’s all-American childhood
conveyed in sweeping
Spielbergian pans, effective use
of newly chic documentary-style
scenes and interesting use of deep
focus. But once again, it isn’t
enough to tie it all together.

“This is not just another Vietnam
movie,” says Cruise, “It tells us

the theme is hastily telegraphed
rather than learned through seeing
this treatment of Kovic’s important

potentially grand design, its lack
of structural and emotional focus

elaborate entertainment.
