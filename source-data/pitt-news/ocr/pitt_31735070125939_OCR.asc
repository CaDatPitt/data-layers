Crime statistics show jump
in burglary, drop in robbery

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

According to Pitt police
Cmdr. Kathy Schreiber, crime
statistics at Pitt’s urban campus
are “very, very good.”

Each year, in compliance
with federal law, the Pitt police.
release crime statistics that
detail criminal activity on or

near the University. Year’2000’

statistics, published by police
this fall, reﬂect what Schreiber
referred to as a continued com-
mitment by police to promot-
ing safety here.

Schreiber, who has the pri-

mary responsibility for compil-
ing crime statistics, said that
the department uses the ﬁgures
to better serve the University
community. In addition to pub-
licly released statistics, the
police also keep track of the
time and location of all crimi-
nal incidents and can plan their
coverage of the campus
accordingly. ' '

“There may be fewer offi-
cers on Monday night than on
Thursday, Friday or Saturday
nights,” she said, adding that
areas of thecampus that have
more criminal activity will
likely be assigned more offi-

\
7

cers and guards. .
Schreiber said that while
more than 70 officers and 21

guards are working to prevent .

crime on campus, crime pre-
vention requires teamwork.
“Crime. prevention is a
shared responsibility,” she
said, adding that newly created
crime awareness programs in
various buildings across cam-
pus aim to increase crime
awareness, thereby preventing
criminal acts. . ‘
‘But Schreiber said the
police have other ways of pre-

Communication
department rearranges
class registration

KATE LAUGHLIN
The Pitt News

Ask any student who registers with the communication

. department and most will undoubtedly remember the morning

of last March 15.

By 6 a.m. the line to register for fall classes was already
snaking its way around the outskirts of Thackeray Hall where
registration wouldn’t officially begin until, 8 a.m. The line,
ﬁlled with communication majors clutching their ideal class
schedules,-had begun to form as early as 3:30 a.m.

With increasing numbers of communication majors at the
University and not enough classes to satisfy them, competition
was tight for seats in many of the sought after upper-level class-
es.

Some students felt the only way to win in this ﬁrst come,
first served system was to drag themselves out of bed before
dawn and wait in line. hours before registration even began.
Because of this, the department is now instituting a new proce-
dure for registering its students, effective this semester.

“We are ‘switching from a stand—in—line registration to an
in—house registration,” communication adviser John Gareis
said.

That means that after their usual group advising sessions
next Tuesday and Wednesday, students will not have to take
their prospective schedules — basically no more than wish lists
— to Thackeray themselves on Thursday morning, when regis-
tration officially opens. Instead the paperwork from students in
each group session will be collected and at 7:45 Thursday
morning, newly hired personnel will register each group elec-
tronically in the chronological order of the group sessions. This
gives graduating seniors the highest priority. The next group
sessions will follow the same procedure.

“We think tl1at’s the fairest way to do it,” Gareis said.

One of the many problems last year, Gareis said, was that
with students in other College of Arts and Sciences depart-
ments registering at the same time, some popular communica-
tion classes ﬁlled up after 10 minutes.

“Now communications students will -have an edge,” he
added.

Melis Ersoy, a communication major graduating this
spring, put her time in last semester. “It was hard because I was
afraid I wouldn’t get the classes I needed even though I was
registering as a senior,” she said. A _

The registration procedure isn’t the only aspect of the
department undergoing improvements, either. There has been
anincrease in personnel, both advising and teaching staff, and
also an increase in the availability of certain classes.

According to Gareis, after registration began last spring,
the communication department added six or seven more thou-
sand-level classes to its fall schedule to accommodate the stu-
dent demand.

“The number of classes we ended up with during last

Academic affairs

chair has

ERIN BRACHLOW
Staff Writer

Istiaque “George” Ayub became the
chair of Student Government Board’s aca-
demic affairs committee 10 days ago. But
Ayub already has big plans. _

His most extensive agenda item is the
proposed creation of an academic inter-
face program: to build a bridge between
the various academic organizations on
campus. Under the initiative, student
groups’-7-’su’clr‘-7 I as the 1 Business and

j, Engineering'Student Councils, as well as
'1 “major-intensive” organizations, will join
' to voice their problems and search for

solutions.~ g , .
“This willhelp my committee under-
stand the problems that the student body
faces every day,” Ayub said. “The more
informed we are, the more help we can be
with these issues.” . V I
‘ Ayub emphasizes that he “can’t
guess” at job, saying that the only way

he -and. his committee can help the stu-
dentsisrto get to feedback directly from -
g them-. ' ‘ ‘ I

., - Ayub said he will use his own experi-
ences at Pitt to help his committee. As a

big plans

computer engineering student, he receives
an academic standing worksheet every
semester, which gives him a list of the

, required classes he still has to take before

graduation. Because this has helped him
plan his semesters and his future career
more easily, he is working to make the
sheets mandatory in all departments.

“Students will know where they are
regarding graduation and there is no con-
fusion,” he said. “It will help them plan
better in advance.” «

In addition to his own .committee_-’_s , .
objectives, SGB hasalso set up a‘p‘r'oject ;
for the committee. Ayub, board member 1
Kevin Washo and SGB’,s technology 
committee are working together to design’; ,
a ﬁnancial aid scholarship search project‘. 

The group will try to collect all avail-j .
able scholarship infonnation and combine ‘
it into one database so students can access _

it on the Internet. . - 1
“Students can go on the Web, an

using their QPA and their major, ﬁnd what 7_

scholarships are out there,” Ayubsaid. I

Study shows teen—agers who
binge drink damage livers  

RYAN MCLIMANS
Staff Writer

In a ﬁrst-of-its-kind study, Pitt’s
School of Medicine proved conclu-
sively that adolescents who frequently
binge drink often sustain moderate
liver damage.

The Pittsburgh Adolescent
Alcohol Research Center, led by pro-

, fessor of psychiatry Dr. Duncan B.

Clark, examined teen—agers with alco-
hol use disorders in an effort to find
the’ origins of the health complaints
concerning these 14- to 18-year-olds.

Clark and his colleagues extracted
blood samples from a group of healthy
teens and compared them to the blood
of teens diagnosed as having an alco-
hol use disorder. The research exposed
elevated liver enzymes in the alcohol
use disorder group, indicating vulner-
ability in adolescents to the toxic
affects of alcohol.

“Although most of the cases of
liver injury were modest,” Clark said,

“continued heavy drinking may wors-

en these abnormalities and cause liver

disease in adulthood.” ,
According to a University of

Texas study, teens start drinking at /

earlier ages every year, adding to the
approximately 7 million cases of teen-
age alcohol use disorders. But very lit-
tle research exists concerning teen-age
health. ‘ ~
“Teen-agers with an alcoholic use
disorder are classified as having a
physical or psychological dependency
on alcohol,” Clark said. “They abuse
alcohol with a lack of control or the
ability to reduce drinking and contin-

ue to drink regardless of social conse-

quence.’’

Clark’s study is one of the few to
look at physical evidence and screen
for negative emotional problems not
related to organ damage. Adolescents
with alcohol use disorders were diag-
nosed as having clinical depression
and having anincreased anxiety from

' the emotionally damaging affects of

alcohol. .

Nordenberg honored by
Jewish National Fund

GREG HELLER-LABELLE I
Staff Writer

The Jewish National Fund honored
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg with its
highest honor, the Tree of Life award,
at a celebration dinner on Monday
night.

The evening’s events Ibcused on
Nordenberg’s accomplishments in the
ﬁeld of education, beginning with his
award-winning teaching at Pitt’s Law
School and culminating with his inau-
guration as Pitt chancellor in 1995.

Along with plenty of Pitt football
jokes, the presenters pointed out
Nordenberg’s many positions on local
boards and panels as well as his roles in
various civic activities.

Steven H. Schwartz, JNF’s Western
Pennsylvania regional president, intro-
duced Nordenberg, calling him “the
highest example of spirit, community

_ and dedication.”

Former award winners were pre-
sent at the celebration, along with
Pittsburgh notables including Howard
Hanna and Mayor Tom Murphy and
numerous area figures in higher educa-
tion.

Nordenberg’s close friend and for-
mer award winner Dan‘ Rooney, presi-
dent of the Pittsburgh Steelers, present-
ed the award to Nordenberg. _

After begging for “a little patience”
for both the Panthers and Steelers foot-
ball clubs, Rooney recalled
Nordenberg’s election to chancellor
after an interim term in 1995.

“The University had to bring conﬁ-

dence and integrity back to Pittsburgh,”

Rooney said.

Rooney ‘pointed to signs of Pitt’s
success under Nordenberg, including
the construction of the Petersen Events

. Center and the fact that Pitt produced

Marshall Scholars in both 2000 and
2001. '

“The University of Pittsburgh is '

one of the finest and most productive in

the world,” Rooney said.

Nordenberg said that he was “hon—
ored to be associated with the other
leaders in the region who have come
together,” and recalled memories of his
ﬁrst trip to Israel.

“I can still feel the excitement of
being in Israel for the first time,” he
said. “I had never experienced quite the
same feeling before  feelings ground-
ed in the sense that that everyone
around me cared deeply.”

Nordenberg related that sense of
caring to the kindness shown in this
country since Sept. 11.

He spoke about his second landing
in Israel, when his plane out of Tel Aviv
lost an engine’ after about 45 minutes
and had to turn around. Nordenberg
recalled seeing the “large collection of
fire trucks and ambulances”. on the tar-
mac. - ,
“When my feet touched the soil of
Israel, I felt safe and secure,”
Nordenberg said. “I think that would be
our collective wish tonight: safety and
security for Israel.” .

The award, presented “in recogni-
tion of outstanding professional and
humanitarian leadership, dedication to
Israeli-American friendship and devo-
tion to world peace,” also called for a

‘forest to be planted in Israel in

Nordenberg’s name. Trees are a very
important symbol of the JNF, which has
planted more than 210 million trees in
Israel in- the country’s 50-year history.

Nordenberg mentioned the
progress that the JNF had made in revi-
talizing Israel.

“We saw green land in areas that
had been deserts,” Nordenberg said. “It
was indeed the holy land.”

Nordenberg said that he was ‘‘hon—

‘ ored and humbled” by the award and

the forest, which will be in American
Independence Park in Jerusalem.
“Being a part of this process is one

of the most meaningful things that has _

happened in my life,” he said.

negative emotions felt social isolation,
excessive fear and feelings of distress
"nausea. The respondents reported
physical problems such as abdominal
discomfort, muscle and joint pain and
headaches. ‘
Other physical exam abnormali-
ties showed up in oral exams, where
researchers found dental cavities and
gingivitis because of a lack of

hygiene.
“These adolescents are not con-

sciously taking care of themselves,” '

Clark said. “They lack protective
behaviors, take risks and practice
inadequate health maintenance.”
Sponsored by federal. funding
from the National Institute of Health,
Clark and his fellow researchers plan
to follow this group of adolescents to
monitor adult outcomes in their phys-
ical and mental health. ‘

Pitt police say zero tolerance policy keeps crime low

Crime, page 1

venting crime. ’

“We have found that because we
have a zero-tolerance policy for alco-
hol and drugs, we can stop a lot of

problems from occurring,” she said.

According to Schreiber, the
University faced more problems in the
past because students got into trouble
after using drugs or alcohol.

“We had a lot of problems in the
past with people out in the streets, get-
ting their beer muscles up and duking
it out,” she said.

Schreiber also said some of the

statistics are slightly inﬂated, because
the numbers reﬂect the total number
of reported crimes, some of which
may turn out to be false reports.

But the figures only reﬂect crimes

that occur on University property. And .

while Pitt owns or operates hundreds
of properties in Oakland and sur-
rounding areas, much of Oakland is
owned privately and is therefore the
responsibility of the city police.
Officially, Pitt police are empow-
ered to operate within 500 yards of
any University-owned, —operated or -
leased property. But when that area
includes private residences or busi-

nesses, Schreiber said, city police
handle the incident. ,

But, she said, that doesn’t mean
Pitt police won’t respond in an emer-
gency.

“If we see a crime on the street,
we’re certainly going to respond to
it,” she said. '

Though burglaries increased by
50 percent from last year «and rob-
beries decreased by 31 percent,
Schreiber said the statistics show con-
sistency from year to year. ,

“Every year, there are going to be
ups and downs,” she said. “I think [the
statistics] show a consistency in our

Schreiber said that most of the
thefts on campus are the result of
unattended valuables, and again

stressed the important role students '

play in preventing crime.

Regarding forcible sexual offens-
es —— four of which occurred in Pitt’s
residence halls last year —— she said
that most of the sexual offenses at Pitt
are between acquaintances.

“Most of our sex offenses report-
ed are those where the individual
knows the perpetrator,” she said. “In
many instances, alcohol was being

EDITORIAL

In land of free speech, why force
  the Pledge of Allegiance?

Patriotism isn’t always predictable.
Some people feel national pride watch-
ing ﬁreworks displays on Independence
Day; others might get the same feeling
listening to Bruce Springsteen, watch-
ing a baseball game or driving cross-
country on Route 66.

In short, people experience patrio-
tism in different ways, at different times
and in different places. You can’t always
predict this feeling, and you certainly
carmot legislate it. .

Yet the ridiculous notion of mandat-
ing patriotism seems to be the objective
of legislators in the state House of
Representatives, who passed a bill on
Tuesday requiring students in
Pennsylvania to recite the Pledge of
Allegiance or sing the national anthem
each morning.

Passed by a vote of 200 to one, the
same bill also requires all classrooms to
display the American ﬂag. Students may
be exempted from the pledge or from
singing the national anthem only if they
have their parents’ written permission.

The inefﬁcacy and utter pointless-
ness of such a bill is striking.

. How would these provisions be
enforced? Certainly our law ' enforce-
ment agencies havegreater socialills to
focus on than the failure of schoolchild-

ren to recite the pledge.

Furthermore, pride and commit-
ment to one’s country — the values
espoused in the Pledge- of Allegiance
and “The Star-Spangled Barmer” — are
meaningful only if they are genuinely
felt. A seventh grader mumbling the
words to the pledge at 7:30 a.m.,‘ when
he is still half-asleep, is not necessarily
experiencing true patriotism.

Our lawmakers carmot force anyone
to feel patriotic, no matter how many
statutes they approve. What they can do
is focus on issues that matter, working
to lower crime rates, improve thezstate
system of education and otherwise
strive to better the commonwealth. By
doing so they will increase the genuine
pride we feel for our state and our coun-

Finally, children — and adolescents
in particular — may find that they have
religious or moral values that differ
from those-expressed in the pledge and
the national anthem, and perhaps that
diverge from those of their parents.

This new bill — if approved by. the
state Senate — leaves those students

‘without a means of expressing them-

selves; In our land of choice and oppor-
tunity, there is something disturbingly
un—American about forced conformity.

students themselves. These madrassas,

people ready to believe this propaganda -
and who will kill — and die — simply because they at
so misled.

The crowds of anti—American protestors on the
streets of Pakistan and Indonesia are products of the
same forces that made Nazis out of German citizens.
A charismatic leader, aiming to exploit the minds of
people troubled by poverty, trauma or social instabili-
ty, offers an easy-to-identify scapegoat as the source
of the trouble. For Adolph Hitler, it was the Jews. For
bin Laden, it is “Godless Westerners.”

Right now, there are thousands of young Muslim
men sitting in Pakistani madrassas (radical Islamic
schools) learning about the sins of America against
Islam. '

Every day, for hours at a time, the madrassa stu-

which are often funded by terrorist groups
such as bin Laden’s Al Qaeda; offer an escape from
crushing poverty for many men from the lower class-
es of Middle Eastern society. They provide food, shel-
ter, structure and educationto men whose lives might
otherwise be a struggle for survival.

Despite their dire circumstances, it is nearly
impossible to understand any ideology that demands
the blood of innocent people. It is nearlyimpossible to
understand the type of weak-willed minds that can be
seduced by such blatant, one—sided propaganda.

Fortimately, everyone knows that the average
ﬂag—waving American would never blindly‘ accept a
hateful or overly nationalistic ideology, as a result of

’ violence or social troubles. Our actions, from the pres-

ident’s rousing speeches to the wearing of shirts that

can’t afford another Timothy McVeigh.

Next time I go to class and I see a white man with long hair
and a trench coat, he’s got to go. I don’t want him opening ﬁre
on my classmates and me. I don’t know what type of issues he
may be going through, but I don’t want to be the victim of any

0 Columbine-type atrocities.

I’m not stopping there, either. If I see any white woman

with four crying children around her who appears a little neu- A

rotic, I’m calling 911. I don’t want to read about any more chil-
dren being drowned in a bathtub. Andrea Yates was enough. We
need to nip this in the bud right now. 0

We don’t need to mention what to do with white cops. We
must reason that they all are at least potentially as dangerous as

John Charmo or Jeffrey Cooperstein if we are going to reason -

that all Arabs are potential terrorists or all black drivers are
potential drug smugglers.

There is no easy time- or cost—efﬁcient way to prevent what
happened Sept. 11. Racial proﬁling at airports may make some

white passengers feel safer, but it does shit can for minorities ,

who will feel no safety from embarrassment and prejudice.

So we pay higher salaries to security ofﬁcials and spend
extra time on training. Anyone should be checked who’s found
with a sharp object, be it a letter opener or a bottle opener. You
watch for bulky jackets and large heavy suitcases. Pilot trainers
should be wary of students who want to learn how to ﬂy with-
out first learning how to take off or land.

It is embarrassing and it is an inconvenience. But embar-
rassment and inconvenience should not be limited only to those
with colored skin.

Brentin C. Mock, aka J. Rap Brown, would like to congratulate

Nkemjika Ofodile and Penny Semaia for defying the proﬁle of
how the traditional Pitt homecoming king and queen look.

We’re threatened and

people want ‘root causes?’

I am writing this to you from
Wall Street in downtown New
York, where we are under constant
threat of further attack by the bar-
barians who murdered more than
5,000 people in the World Trade
Center. I was here during the attack
and was nearly killed myself for
the sin of performing my job and
being a tax paying U.S. citizen.

I’m outraged by the ivory

tower idealists attempting to place A

blame for the World Trade Center
attack on the United States and
diverting much needed energy
away from this nation’s ﬁght for
survival. These are the same type
of spineless people who tried to
appease Hitler before the start of
World War H. Even if America
was run by monkeys wiﬂi the
worst foreign policy in the ‘history
of civilization, nothing provides
justiﬁcation for these attacks.
Nothing provides justiﬁcation to
“understand” these barbarians or
negotiate with them in any way.
Thank God that brave people in
this country didn’t cry tears for the

enemy and search for “root caus-
es” when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor. A

Although the peace crowd’

will respond with countless “intel-
lectual” arguments as to why we
shouldn’t have a backbone and

support this ﬁght with resolve, I for

one reject their wishy-washy,
senseless rhetoric. My life, my
faniily’s life and the survival of this
country are on the line. If they
can’t or are too afraid to confront
this reality, then God help them.

Reality check

Nkemjika Ofodile’s criticism
of The Pitt News’ coverage of the

homecoming results (Letter to the .

editor, Oct 15) was both arrogant
and unjustiﬁed — and I am in no
way a grand supporter of The Pitt
News’ views or articles. .

But in case you haven’t
noticed by the collapse of the
World Trade Center, bombing in
Afghanistan, the anthrax evacua-

    

tion of lower campus or simply by

the hundreds of students at half- 4

time Saturday who felt that getting
their nachos was a larger ‘priority
than seeing you crowned, most of
us have more important things on
our minds than the crowning of a
“queen” that 98 percent of us don’t
even know. ‘

And to suggest that the lack of 0

coverage was somehow race relat-
ed is even more ridiculous, consid-

ering that The Pitt News seems to J

cover any puny minority event it
can ﬁnd. -

The fact is: Few people care
about the homecoming court, and
few will ever care in a place this
big. So just be happy you won,

take your crown and the picture of‘ .

the back of your head, put away
the race card and do something
constructive. '

THE PITT NEWS

133

 

Welcome to another edition of the
Compulsive Corner, which may be
renamed the Push Comer since I cannot
get more than one game over .500.

My record is now 12-11-1 as it took a

2 round of overtime for Fresno State to

squeeze by Colorado State and Temple —

shockingly enough — blew out Rutgers. ,

Syracuse covered easily against Pitt and
Nebraska, as always, covered. The tie
comes from a push between Duke and
Wake Forest.

Pitt at Boston College (-10)

Last week I said I would not pick Pitt
in a game until it shows some consistency
and my View has not changed this week,
especially with the spread jumping a point
and a half yesterday. '

William Green, statistically, is the best V

runner in the Big East as he has nm for 787

- yards and eight touchdowns on the season.
Green has rushed for more 100 yards in;

every game this season with the exception
of last week against Virginia Tech.

. . Quarterback Brian St. Pierre has done
an adequate, job for the Eagles this season.
He keeps his team in every game because
he; doesn’t make many mistakes. Last
week, in the tearn’s 34-20 ‘loss to Virginia
Tech, he completed 13 of 26 passes for
180 yards, two touchdowns and no inter-
ceptions. ‘ ’

Pitt is also facing one of the best wide
receiver tanderns that it will see this season
in seniors Dedrick DeWalt and Ryan Read.

Pitt’s defense has been in disarray all

, season as its pass defense was exposed

several times this season. The offense gave
up 10 turnovers in the last two games, so
the defense has been on the ﬁeld more,

best running back in college football. Last
weekend against then-No. 8 Washington,
he rumbled for 301 yards on 31 carries,
scoring four times. -

In last week’s 35-13 win, the Bruins’
defense gave up a miniscule 16 rushing
yards on 29 carries while racking up four
sacks.

  

Califomia is one of the worst teams in
Division l—A football and Saturday it has
the distinct pleasure of visiting quite possi-
bly the best team in UCLA. .

As sad as it is, margin of victory is still‘
an important factor in the rankings and
UCLA will need to dominate the winless
Golden Bears.

Texas Tech at Nebraska (-23.5)

If you haven’t ﬁgured it out yet, I’m
not going to stop picking Nebraska until it
fails to cover a game. The Cornhuskers
have covered every game this season.

This is Nebraska’s ﬁnal game before it
battles Oklahoma, so look for the team to
continue its dominance. The Comhuskers
are winning by an average of more than 30
points per game.

Last week, Nebraska had four runners
go for more than 100 yards and it’s aver-
aging 340 yards per game on the ground.

Red Raiders’ quarterback Kliff
Kingsbury has averaged 47 pass attempts
over hislast three games. Abandoning the
run can be a bad move in Lincoln, with the
crowd noise making it hard to hear the
snap count. Plus, Nebraska likes to hold
onto the ball and punish defenses and, if a
team chooses to pass the whole game, it
has a good chance of its defense wearing
down. 2

Nebraska is 6-0 against Texas Tech,
winning by an average of 38 points.
Nebraska won last year’s meeting 56-3.

Bowling team ready
to strike opponents

NATALIE KRASMAN
Staff Writer

The basement of ' the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association holds a secret.

Underground, deep in the darkness
of the PAA, a congregation of mysteri-

ous Pitt athletes meets every Tuesday “
‘V and Wednesday night.

These Pitt elites have never received
media exposure and are now going to be
revealed to the public.

’ Making its debut to The Pitt News,
ladies and gentlemen, is Pitt’s bowling
team. '1

The organization is an official
University club that accepts any Pitt stu-
dent as a participant.

The bowling club has a men’s and a
women’s team that divided into two sec-
tions of bowlers, the travelers and the
non-travelers.

The travelers are required to have at
least a 180 average and are still not guar-
anteed a position. Students who score
above a 180 are asked to try out and will
be accepted based on their performance
as well as the performances of the other

competing students. This year’s travel— ,

ing team will compete in three tourna-
ments in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Montana, competing against top schools
like Nebraska, St. John’s and Michigan
State.

This journey is unlike that of Pitt’s
major athletic teams funded by the
University. The bowling squad’s trans-
portation and overnight accommoda-
tions are member-subsidized and. the
expenses translate to few toumament
appearances for Pitt’s team. a

Students without qualifying aver-
ages join the non—traveling team. With
passion for and devotion to bowling, the
non—travelers attend practices without
the fulﬁllment of tournament contention.
In practice, non-travelers participate in
inter—squad bowling matches and receive

instruction from the traveling squad on
lane reading and an assortment of other
game—enhancing tips.

Beau Dunkerly, a senior psychology
major, held team auditions on Sept. 15

and 16. Dunkerly was disappointed with '

this year’s turnout, but understands that a
lack of publicity translates into a small
attendance at tryouts.

' “I usually go to the activities fair to
recruit people to the team, but I missed it
this year,” Dunkerly said. “So I only was
able to hang up ﬂyers around campus to
get students to join. The turnout was
smaller than usual, probably because I
missed the fair.”

Last year between 25 and 30 stu-
dents tried out, but the attendance this
year declined, with only 15 students par-
ticipating. ‘

Positions on the team are not closed
and Dunkerly says that any student who
has bowling experience should stop by
the PAA and sign up.

“The opportunity for students with
skill to join is always available. But we
are really hurting for good women
bowlers,” Dunkerly said.

The club originated in the 1980s but
was disassembled. Dunkerly, who has
been bowling since he was 4 years old,
arrived at Pitt in 1998 and teamed up
with Joe Ritter, a bowling pro shop man-
ager and coach of the team to re-institute
a bowling club at Pitt.

Last weekend, the travelers’ first
excursion was scheduled, to be the
Keystone Quaker-Classic in Allentown,

, Pa. Theirentry form was submitted late,

the tournament ﬁlled up and the travel-
ers’ application_was rejected.

The travelers will resume competi-
tive play at the Kent State Tournament in
Kent, Ohio on Nov. 3 and 4.

If students have questions or would
like to enroll, they should -contact the
PAA at (412) 621-2400 and ask to speak
to Beau Dunkerly.

‘Hail to Pitt’ important
part of storied history

I Column, page l2

n’t support our players and our school’s
traditions.

When my father went to Pitt in the
late 1960s, fans chanted “alleghenee,
genac, genac, genac.” “Hail to Pitt” is an
old song. We have one of the oldest foot-
ball programs of any school in the coun-

try, a program that has won nine nation- ‘

al championships. Fight_songs are inex-
orably part of a school’s tradition.

My roommate remembers playing
the ﬁght song of Notre Dame — perhaps
the most storied college football pro-
gram — in high ‘ school band in

H. Connecticut. Another friend told me
about seeing a four—year-old in South

Bend singing that same song from mem-
ory.

Most of us can’t recite our ﬁght
songs, much less -know to chant when
we’re supposed to. While the Panthers
are in a new home this year, everywhere
we see reminders of the past. We see the
eight retired numbers. We’re reminded

that our program has won nine national’

championships. We’re told of bowl

‘ games in which the Panthers participat-

ed.

_ Pitt football has a glorious past and
we should remember -that. Part of
remembering, though, means that we
remember school traditions. While I’ve

never been to a game at another school, '1

myrfriends who have say that they chant
a lot more and‘ feel more energy overall
in the stadium.

We’re college kids. We’re supposed
to be young and rowdy. While Heinz
Field is an NFL stadium primarily, it’s
ours, too. Let’s remind people that they
are at a college football game. Let’s
remind people that they’re at the home

of one of the most storied programs in‘

college. football history, a program that
has a link with its glorious past.

It’s time to bring back “alleghenee,
genac, genac, genac.” ‘

On Nov. 3,'I expect to hear Heinz
Field resonating with that sound. The
words may not mean anything in the
English language, but they mean tradi-
tion in the language of the Panthers.

Repeat after me, young ones:
“alleghenee, genac, genac, genac.”

Perspectives Editor David McKenzie

hopes hes not so old that he can now r

remember an obsolete tradition.

has won four straight. *

With four quality wins against Florida
State, North Carolina State, East Carolina
and Virginia, the Tar Heels are primed for

a top 25 ranking.

Although the team lost to Clemson
38-14 last season, it did lead the game 17-
0 at one point. V ‘

Clemson quarterback Woody
Dantzler has to be the most electrifying
player in college. football. He leads his
team in passing and rushing and has
scored an amazing 15 touchdowns already
this season.

Freshman Darian Durant has done a
nice A j ob for North Carolina at quarterback.
He is only averaging 16 attempts per game
but he doesn’t hurt the team with mistakes.
Donald Curry still gets some time at quar-
terback but the Carolina ‘offense is keyed
by balance.

Andre Wﬂliarns rushed for 147 of the
tearn’s 234 rushing yards last week against
Virginia and he will have to do the same
this week to keep up with Clernson’s high-
octane attack.

Tar Heels’ defensive end Julius
Peppers will look to haunt Dantzler.
Peppers, who decided to stop playing bas-
ketball for the university, might be as ath-
letic as Dantzler. He has 17 tackles for
losses this season and 8.5 sacks.

Clemson has gained more than 500

that streak ending this week. It should be a _

tough one. I like Clemson to win, with
North Carolina covering. ‘

Kent State (-11) at Buffalo

I know you may be asking why the
hell would I pick a MAC game, but there
is some reasoning behind the madness.

For one thing, Kent State won me
some money a couple of weeks ago when
it covered against Bowling Green, so I
have a soft spot in my heart for the team.
Secondly, the lines never move with these
games because there’s not a _lot of action
surrounding them.

I also know that both teams are woe-
ful, so there shouldn’t be too many sur-
prises. Buffalo lost to Rutgers 31-15, so
you know they’re bad. The team was also
shut out by Bowling Green 35-0, while
_Kent State only lost to Bowling Green by
17.’

Kent State covered in that game vs.
Bowling Green and it also covered early in
the year in a 34-14 loss to West Virginia. _

And for my ﬁnal piece of urmecessary
knowledge about Kent State, they just beat

Northern Illinois, who beat South Florida

earlier in the year, who beat you—knoW-
who ... Pitt. _ .

Does that mean that Kent State is bet-
ter than Pitt?

Notre Dame Dual Meet, Oct. 5:
Notre Dame 223, Pitt 77

_ In addition to the relays, the women’s
team also competed in a dual meet with the
Fighting Irish. -

Despite-ﬁnishing far behind, Pitt did
well in the 200-yard medley relay, 1,000-
yard freestyle, 100—yard breaststroke and
100-yard backstroke. ' ,

The 200-yard medley relay team con-
sisting of Savini, Redman, Nicholson and
Livingstone came in second place posting a
time of 1:47.65. Emily Colley came in sec-

ond place in the 1,000-yard freestyle with a -

time of 10:26.24. Savini posted a time of

1 59.15 in the‘ 100,-yard backstroke, which

earned her third place. Redman placed ﬁrst
in the100—yard breaststroke with a time of
1:04.55.

‘ “I was very excited to see people come
into the season strong,” women’s coach
Marian Cassidy Keen said. “Having an
early meet such asthis really helped us in

Oct. 12 marked the annual Blue—Gold
swim meet and both Gold teams triumphed
as the women’s Gold team defeated the
Blue 133-95 and the men’s Gold team won
over the Blue team 155-81.

For the women, sophomore Jen

O’Bn'en placed ﬁrst in both the 3—meter and '

l—meter diving competitions. Senior
Michael Wells won ﬁrst place in both com-
petitions on the men’s side.

The men continued to impress Knoles
after a strong showing the previous week at
the Notre Dame Relays. _

“We won 11 relays at Notre Dame and

set seven meet records. This looks to be a set .

up to a very good season.” .

St. Bonaventure is the next opponent
for the men’s and women’s teams. Both
coaches are feeling good about the meet and
looking forward to some solid competition.

“We are looking forward to being

‘home and hopefully competing in front of a

nice sized crowd,” Cassidy Keen said.
