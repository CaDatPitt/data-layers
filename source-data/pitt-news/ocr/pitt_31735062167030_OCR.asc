its committees. Applications can be picked up at the SG Office
(305 SU) and should turned in by Feb. 26. The following are
the committees and their functions:

Off-Campus Housing Committee: surveys Oakland (primarily)
and surrounding areas to provide information concerning the
availability and desirability of off-campus housing for University
students. This committee also studies relating issues, including
discrimination in off-campus housing and the prospects of Uni-
versity-owned apartments. ’

Bookstore Committee: examines policies in the Bookstore

that the Bookstore serves both students and faculty in the best
way possible. Book costs and return procedures are among the

d-ents in medicine and denistryi

continuing subjects evaluated by this committee.

Secondary Schools Committee: works in recruiting high school
seniors who are prospective University students through person-
to-person contact. This committee also provides information about
the University and can have a great impact on the makeup and
attitude of incoming University students.

Health Service Committee:
strives for the -betterment of
the Student Health Services by
evaluating current health facil-
ities, sam-pling student opinion,
and recommending improve-
ments. I

Traditions Committee: tries
to engender into the University
the enduring traditions that
make a university noteworthy
and memorable. This is done by
highlighting existing traditions
and when possible, creating new
ones.

By Laws Committee: writes
new by-laws for the Constitu-
tion and amends old -ones as
necessary. This committee is
largely responsible for the na-
ture and workability of a Con-

School of Nursing
To Hold Meeting

The School of Nursing will
meet with potential applicants
who wish to obtain a B.S de-
gree under the new curriculum.
The current curriculum will be
offered for the last time in Sep-
tember, 1968. Part-time students
are not eligible for admission in
September. All other candidates
must meet requirements for the
new curriculum.

Meetings will be held Mon-
day, 7-8 p.m., and Wednesday,
4-5 p.m., in 423 Scaife Hall for
those students not eligible for
admission in September, 1968,
and all others who did not at-
tend previous sessions.

Selective Service Abolishes

100,000 to 150,000 men to be
drafted during ﬁscal year 1969,
as a result of the decision on
draft defenments. Another 75,-
000 are expected to volunteer
f-or service under the threat of
the draft,” according to The
New York Times.

The Times reports that most
of the new draftees “will in-
clude the June graduates of four
year colleges, graduate students,
and men who will receive their
master's degree this June.”

It is estimated that roughly
41 per cent of the 350,000 col-
lege seniors and 144,000 ﬁrst
year graduate students will be
inducted into the army.

The Times states that “the
magnitude of the effect can be
ascertained when the major por-
tion of these 225,000 men—rthe
150,000 who may not choose to
enlist and are drafted outright
-—is compared to the 14,000 four
year college graduates who win
be drafted during the current
ﬁscal year.”

In reaction to -the draft de-
cision, President of the Coun-
cil of Graduate Schools Gustave

appalled at the new draft reg-
ulations. . . . It is obvious that
the decisions were based pure-
ly on political considerations
and bear no relation to the real-
ities of national interests.” ‘

The Johnson administration
obviously believes that the new
draft regulations -are in the na-
tional interest. Dr. Arlrc 
agrees with this point of view.

Arlt believes that the decision
will have a drastic effect on
undergraduate education. The
effect lies in the future reduc-
tion of graduate teaching assis-
tants. The Times reports that
this reducti-on will lead to two
results: either admission will be
restricted or the quality will de-
cline.

The crucial issue, «according to
Arlt is “the more serious as-
pect . . . of the long range ef-
fect." He states that if next
September's intake of graduate
students drops by 40 per cent,
the Ph.D. output will drop from
an estimated 26,000 to 16,000 in
1972. This would be -a ten year
setback of Ph.D. output.

AWS CORRECTION

The percentage of Universi-
ty women who participated in
the AWS elections last wea-
nesday was approximately 15
per cent, not six per cent, as
stated in Frlday’s issue of The
Pitt News.

Also in the election results,
Barbara Sher was elected vice-
president of Panhellenlc Coun-

by ALAN MEYER

The University's Orchesis
dance group participated in a
full day of mo-dern dance per-
formance and instruction Satur-
day. A Regional Colle-giate Dance
Festival was held in the m-orn-
ing, featuring four perforrn—
ances by Orchesis, a dancer
from Mt. Lebanon, and a pre-col-
lege group sponsored by Carne-
gie-Mellon University (CMU).

Miss Josephine Cressner from
Mt. Lebanon began with solo
dance using conventional m-od-
ern technique. Her composition
was done to Simon and Garfunk-
el’s “Sounds of Silence.”

After this, Miss Barbara Deck-
er of CMU with Robin Benson,
Nancy Cohen, and Jody Lop-atin
of Orchesis put on an original
composition called “The Mask-
ers.” The four dancers, each
wearing a paper mache mask,
danced to a stre-am of conscious-
ness poem read by Miss Decker
and played on a tape recorder
in the background. The four ﬁg-
ures played out a psychological
drama with each one personify-
ing a concept in the poem. Miss
Decker composed both the poem
and the choreographed the dance.

Misses Decker and Lopatin
next performed a dance choreo-

duel Banessia, a local musici-an
provided a drum background
which lent a dramatic tension,
or as he expressed it, “soul,” to
the dance. The computer com-
position was refreshingly free
of those movements which have
become cliches in mode-rn dance,
and such choreographies help
to break down self-imposed lim-
itations which most choreo-
gr-a.p-hers rely upon.

The ﬁnal performance, called
“Movement Kinetics,” was by
the CMU pre - college group.
Through the girls didn’t have

they put on an effective per-
formance based on an interplay

offer:  

a chance to fall on your face

Most of our top people have at one time or other.
The experience is enlightening. That's why we make‘
such a big thing of it.

We put plenty of responsibility on our new people.
Some stagger a little. Others buckle at the knees. Then
we try to shore them up, but we don't take the load off.

After a while (wi.th considerable effort on their
part), they gradually learn to handle the job. Then we
usually add more work. We ﬁnd people grow fast this way.

Of course, it’s risky. There are some scary moments
for management (they tend to grey hair and baldness
at an early age). But, they remember they were given
the chance to fall on their faces too. So they resist the
temptation to come to the rescue.

If you're looking for a chance to fall on your face,
we’ll give it to you.

Editorial: Time of Decision

The recent decision to abolish graduate and occupational defer-
ments casts a gloomy shadow over the university communities of this
nation. The decision, in our view, will ultimately. burden and hamper the
causes and advantages of graduate education and even affect our national
interests. We, therefore, stand categorically opposed to the new draft

regulations.

We seriously question if the advantage-s of the new regulations
outweigh the disadvantages. One immediate disadvantage of the aboli-
tion of the graduate deferment will be the decline of graduate school

enrollment.

The New York Times estimates that the new regulations will cause
a 40 to 50 per cent decrease in graduate school enrollment and this statis-
tic cannot be taken lightly. Dr. Gustave O. Arlt, president of the Council
of Graduate Schools, stated that “the council is appalled at the new draft
rtgulations. It is obvious that the decisions were based on political consi-
derations and bear no relation to the realities of national interests.”

Given Dr. Arlt’s expertise and the fact that graduate enrollment
will probably dip 40 to 50 per cent, we contend that the new draft regula-
tions will have not only have a detrimental effect on education, but also
will cause grave problems of national concern. On the educational level,
the reduction of graduate enrollment will cause a shortage of teaching
fellows. As the Times concluded, the shortage of teaching fellows will re-
sult either in admissions restrictions or lack of quality on the undergrad-

uate level.

The new regulations will also drastically alter Ph.D. output. If grad-
uate enrollment declines 40 per cent, Ph.D.
setback, according to Dr. Arlt.

In this decade of vast historical signiﬁcance, can a government
that is waging war in Vietnam, fighting rebellion in its very cities, and
attempting to reach the moon afford to suffer a ten year setback in
Ph.D. output?

Any ardent observer will attest that a Ph.D. setback not only af-
fects this nation on the university level, but also drastically affects our
government. Needless to say, our government vitally needs men of ex-
pertise. We need men who can make sound judgments on matters of for-
eign policy, economics, nuclear physics, and space exploration. In this
time of need, we believe that the government has defeated its own pur-
pose by abolishing the graduate deferments. ~

President Johnson and his cohorts have made a serious error in
judgment. They have failed to notice the tremendous advantages of grad-
uate education, in lieu of military manpower.

We submit that the Selective Service Commission should reassess
its decision and give future graduate students and scientiﬁc researchers
an opportunity to pursue their wants.

The time for decision has come. The Vietnamese War continues
day after day. The ﬂames of city rebellion remain ﬁxed in our memories.
And what shall the government do?

output will suffer a ten year

Letters To The Editor

AWS Members
Challenge ‘News’

_ Editor, The Pitt News:

As members of the Associated
Women Students (AWS) Coun-
cil, we challenge the editorial
that appeared in the Feb. 16
Pitt News. Neither the facts nor
the accusations made have any
basis in reality.

First of all, it was stated that
“AWS had the largest turnout
of any of the groups electing
officens—approximately six per
cent of those women eligible to
vote.” This is erroneous on all
counts. AWS had a voting turn-
out of about 15 per cent of
those women eligible to vote,
not the stated six per cent. This
is an increase over all past
years. Also, in terms of percen-
tages, Women's Choral and Quo
Vadis had the largest responses,
with about 75 per cent of their
members voting.

AWS means more than “Lan-
tern Night, Freshmen Council,
and .Housing Board.” Under the
outstanding leadership of Ann
Bush, president, AWS effective-
ly served the women of the Uni-
versity. The Scholastic Interests
Committee has been the group
responsi-ble for coordinating the
tours and desk assistant serv-
ices at Hillman Library. This
years’ Activities Fair, with its
carnival theme, surpassed all
past Fairs. The sophomore class
representatives planned the suc-
cessful University receptions af-
ter the Army and Navy foot-
ball games.

The Pitt Woman, a handbook
published by AWS, was distri-
buted to all freshmen women
to acquaint them with the Uni-
versity. A booklet discussing the
advantages and disadvantages
of apartment living in the Oak-
land area has been written by
the Off-Campus Housing chair-
man for all women students.
The Transfer Committee, work-
ing over the summer, initialted a
program that matched Pitt and
transfer women students in a
way sim‘,.,_';r to that of the AWS
Citysis-tier Program. In addi-
tion to Lantern Night, the Tra-
ditions Committee is now en-
gaged in restructuring the Thyr-
sa Amos Comsmri-ttee.

The senior class representa-
tives have planned a Lenox Chi-

na. showing for Feb. 29. The
will .10?  tor the

proceeds

  

 

all women. In order to give
more women a chance to par-
ticipate in AWS, .a.pp'lioatioms for
major officers and class repre-
sentatives were made available.
Steps were taken to guarantee
commuter positions in AWS.
Committee applications were
placed at the AWS voting pol-ls,
and the newly written AWS By-
Laws were distributed so that
all women on campus could
read and comment on them.

The AWS Council organized a
lecture with Dr. Sylvia Wech-s-
ler, .a Pittsburgh gynecologist,
and inivited all women to at-
tend. In conjunction with the
YWCA, the Council is now pre-
paring for next year's Symposi-
um on “Sexuality and the To-
tal Personality.” It also worked
with the Tower C Honor’s Coun-
cil and Amos Hall to keep the
hon-ors area in Tower C. These
are but a few of the accomplish-
ments of the 1967-68 AWS.

If these activities have not
been made known to the wom-
en of the University the fault
h-a.s been largely that of The
Pitt News and its uncooperative
attitude in publicizing AWS
events. It has been the fault of
the women of the University for
not attending AWS meetings.
Ann Bush has-stressed that all
AWS meetings are open; she
has urged women‘ to attend; she
has welcomed their participa-
tion in AWS. Minutes of both
AWS Council and Housing
Board meetings are distributed
in the residence halls. Miss
Bush has given AWS new and
vit-al direction this year. She
has made it an active major
women's organization on cam-
pus.

much enthusiasm as apprecia-
tion the efforts you have made
in sending the telegram to Pres-
ident Johnson to speed my visa.
I am glad to inform you that,
evidently through your appeal
on behalf of the Student Gov-
ernment, the American Consu-

late General in Hong Kong noti-

ﬁed me on Feb. 5, after many
months of waiting, that my visa
has been approved by the State
Department and that I could call
for it today which I did. A

Your admirable action has un-
derscored for me the idea of a
democratic government as de-
ﬁned by- your great President,
Abraham Lincoln, to be one of
the people, by the people and
for the people. You have also
demonstrated to me, a foreign-
er, the high sense of responsi-
bility of American youth in
taking up for the University’s
welfare and the governments
functioning as their own affairs.

If the arrangements with your
University work out smoothly,
I shall join your University in
the Spring term in the latter
part o-f April to which I look
forward with much pleasure
and eagerness.

Please accept my sincere
thanks to you and your Student
Government for the appeal you
have mad-e on my behalf.

Women Decry

Poor Turn-out
Editor, The Pitt News:

Women dorm students want
an open-house policy. Women
dorm students want better se-

curity. Women dorm students
want no curfews. Commuting
women want places to rest.
Commuting women want to feel
like college women instead of
high school girls. The universi-
ty women want, want, want; but
when the time come-s to elect to
AWS, representatives who will
help attain these goals, univer-
sity women fail to turn out and
vote.

University women must not
want things lbadly, for if they
did, surely more than 450 wom-
en would go to the Commons
Room and take five minutes to
vote for persons who can ac-
l-ish things I

am

 
  

  
 
     
 
 

when the majority will not do
their share to ﬁnd a solution? It
is a shame that only 450 wom-

Student Urges
Use of Naponick

Editor, The Pitt News: b
Thlis letter is directed as a
plea to basketball eeaeh Bob

Timmons. Last night I walked.

up Cardiac Hill in sub-freezing
weather to watch the Panthers
play Westminster. As usual, the
crowd was sparce and not too
spirited. As the game went on
it became clear that Pitt was
on its way to another loss. West-
minster was out-shooting: out-
dribbling and ouut-thinking Pitt
constantly.

Then, with Pitt losing by a
substantial margin, a great
cheer rang through the Field
House. Paul Naponick was en-
tering the game. Naponick is
not a starter and he is not a
great basketball player. But he
does have one thing that every-
one else on the Pitt squad lacks
—ﬁght. Nanp-onick is a football

player and he plays basketball
almost exactly as though he
were in Pitt Stadium. Two weeks
in a row Paul managed to do
something that I had never seen
h‘a;p=pen in basketball. He made
possible for a team to score four
points on one basket.

Last night a Westminster
player stole the ball away from
a Pitt man and took the ball
down court for an easy lay-up.
The ball had already gone
through the basket when out of
nowhere came Super-Paul,
smashing head on into the West-
minster player. Usually if a
player is fouled after a basket
is made, he gets one foul shot.
But two weeks in a row Paul
managed to give the opponent
two. And the fans loved it.

When Naponik goes up for -a
rebound his arms, legs, elbows,
and feet all push violently back
and forth mai.ming the oppon-
ent. In short, P.aul is an animal.
And as I have said, the fans
love it. So please Bob Tim-mons,
give up a break. Pitt has two
home games remaining. Let us
see a little action for once. Start
Natponick for the first ﬁve min-
utes, by which time he will have
fouled out and you can replace
him.

Letters To The Editor

AWS President

Knocks ‘News’

Editor, The Pitt News:

The editorial: “AWS: A Need
for Direction,” which appeared
in Friday's paper, not only con-
tained false statistics, but also
displayed an unfortunate mis-
understandrq of the purpose of
this organization.

Approximately 15 per cent of
the eligible voters (‘as compared
with the editorial statement of
six per cent) cast ballots in
W-ednesday’s election. This “poor
turnout” represents an increase
over all past years.

As stated in the newly revised
constitution, “The purpose of
this organization shall b-e to
consider and solve problems re-
1-ating to the role and responsi-
bilities of women students at
the University o-f Pittsburgh; to
foster a spirit of loyalty to the
University; to enrich student
life; to promote fellowship
among fa.culty and administra-
tion and students; to uphold

This Week at the

and develop the traditions of
the University; and to coordi-
n-ate the organized activities of
women into a uniﬁed whole.”
AWS is not a political organ-
ization. AWS, as its name de-
notes, does not purport to rep-
resent all the students, and no
leadership should be expected
to create from it a second Stu-
dent Government. It should also
be understood that Freshman
Council and Housing Board do
not operate in a vacuum. Nei-
ther is “virtually separated

from AWS in term-s of its func- 

tions.” The two vice-presidents

Surprising Wrestlers Upset Leh

 Engineers Lose First

To Varsity Since ’64

by ROY JACOBS
Dave Adams’ suit is being sent to the dry cleaners to-
day, but it is unlikely that the head wre-stling coach minds
the cleaning bill at all. Adams engineered his squad to a stunning
19-13 upset of Lehigh Saturday night and was rewarded for his
efforts by being tossed into the showers by his grapplers after-

wards.

It was the first time the mat-
men have beaten Lehigh since
1964, when they also won, 19-13.
In the three meetings inbetween,
the wrestlers could only man-
age a total of 19 points.

Although Adams was still
dripping from his dunking, his
spirits were far from dampen-
ed.
“Our, guys really tried to-
night,” he remarked. “That was
the difference. Desires makes
up for a lack of something else.

“A.ggressiveness, conditioning,

I and desire were all in our fav-

or,” he continued. “With all that,
I don’t know what else there is
——-maybe luck. I guess we were
lucky too.” .

In the early going, it looked
like the luck was against the
matmen. After Bruce Unangst
opened with a big win at 123,
stretching his unbeaten skein,
Dick Shildt opposed Pete Henn-
ing of Lehigh in probably his
toughest match of the season.

With 30 seconds‘ to go in the

match, Shildt -scored a takedown
to take a 5-3 lead. Seconds later
Henning escaped to draw to
within one point. Then with four
seconds left, both went out of
bounds, and subsequently re-
turned to center mat to ﬁnish
the match.
f Just as time ran out, the ref-
eree awarded Henning one point
because he felt Shildt was stan-
ing. The point -gave Lehigh a
draw. As a result, the largest
Field House crowd of the sea-
son (1,150) called for the ref’s
*-hide. '

Rhone, Allen
Contribute

Key Wins

In an evening of upsets,
two stood out all the more.
Key wins in the wrestling vic-
tory over Lehigh were Jim
Rhone’s 5-4 decision over Elliott
Tepper at 152 and Paul Allen's
come-from-behind win over Ron
Ries at 191.

Tepper was considered Le-
high’s top man, but Rhone ad-
mitted, “you go out there with
the idea you can win, or you
won't have much of a chance.”
-- Rh-o'ne’s winning points came
on a takedown and predicament
in the last minute of the sec-
ond period. ‘

‘_‘I did a pancake, my favorite
takedown move,” he reviewed.
Still, he had to hold on at the
end for the win, reminiscent of
last week, when going off the
mat deliberately hurt him
against F&M.

It was Ries who tried to hold
on against Allen after taking a
4-0 lead early in the second per-
iod, but Paul wore him down.
Altogether Ries was charged

1 four points for stalling. Allen

gave Dave Adams the credit.
.“The coach did it more or

A‘ less,” offered Allen. “He ‘built
rme up during the time outs.
 Ries kept tiring out and kept
Wffaking about his nose. At the

end, I didn’t think he'd be able

 
 

“I was just following up my
earlier warnings,” the ref ex-
plained afterwards. “Everytime
we went back to the center, I
warned Shildt for backing up.
And I didn’t know the time or
the score when I made the call.”

“The questionable call didn’t
hurt us,” said Adams later. “In
the long run, it possibly ﬁred us
up more.” The matmen took the
next three bouts.

Shildt, when asked, only
smiled and turned his thumb
down.

There were several psycholog-
ical lifts for the wrestlers also.
Adams said the freshman vic-
tory “pepped us up” and the
coach thought the crowd reac-
tion was “tremendous.”

The matmen face powerhouse
Penn State next. Adams certain-
ly Wouldn't mind paying the dry
cleaners another visit.

Schillinger Draw Near - Clincher
As Frosh Trip Opponents, 19-14

All the hearalded freshman wrestlers prevailed as expected, but it was the efforts
of one relatively unheard of rookie grappler that, according to coach Bob Fehrs, deter-
mined the frosh’s 19-14 win over the previously unbeaten Lehigh freshmen.

“By the heavyweight match, I felt We would Win,” reviewed Fehrs. “Actually, I think the turn-
ing point was (Tom) Schillinger’s draw.” ;

Schillinger has yet to win a match for the freshmen despite some good wrestling. Saturday,
it was -his escape midway through the second period which led to a 1-1 draw.

BRUCE UNANGST holds onto Lehigh’s Dick Meyer on his way
to a 4-1 win in the opening match of Saturday’s meet. It was
Unangst’-s sixth vicetory without a defeat at 123 pounds.

Three Track Records Set

Before Schillinger’-s 177 pound
match, the frosh led 14-9. Had
he lost, Lehigh would have gone
into the heavyweight match
with the lead. And heavyweight
Ralph Cindrich wasn't overly
conﬁdent.

“I thought I could beat him,”
remembered Cindrich, “but I
was still scared. The same thing
happened at ,Michigan (fresh-
man tournament). It came down

to me, -and I didn't want to let

the team down.”

Cindrich didn’t. He scored an
impressive 9-1 decision against
previously unbeaten Mason
Staub, including a Well-executed
du-ck-under takedown and pre-
dicament near the end of the
match.

The middleweights are the
strong area, and the squad
swept all the matches between
137 and 160.

“They (Lehigh) said they
weren’t too strong in the mid-
-dle,” offered Fehrs. ‘‘All our
boys Went out there with the

idea of a fall.”

Mark Payne, at 145, scored
the only pin of the evening, how-
ever. It came at 3:23 of his
match, and he was completely
dominating his man at the time.

Jack Hopkins, on the other
hand, relied on some last min-
ute heroics to snare a. 7-4 deci-
sion. He achieved a. takedown
and a. predicament in the ﬁnal
ﬁve seconds of his match to
come from behind.

“He fought to the veryend,”
lbeamed Fehrs afterwards. “He
won at the ﬁnal buzzer. It shows
you that you just can't stop
ﬁghting.”

“It was just the ﬁrsrt straw
on the camel's back,” said Le-
‘h-igh coach Jack Valentic. He
must have known what was
coming.

Incidently, the last Lehigh
freshman team to lose was two
years ago . . . to at Dave Adams-
coached Navy pleges team.

Frosh Thinclads Win Fourth Straight, 68-33

by DAVE TIERNAN

“They make it look so easy,” smiled Ohio U. runner

Stan Schorstein after he and his team lost to the frosh

tracksters. 66-38, Saturday.

Schorstein should know. He followed Jerry Richey across the
ﬁnish line in the mile, after Richey pulled away in the last two
laps. He won the 1000 yard run, and after a ten minute breather,
ran the second leg for Ohio U.’s mile relay team.

Actually, the frosh did make
their fourth straight victory
loo-k easy. Rudy Hufnagl ar-
rived on the track just in time
to set a frosh record in the 600
yard dash with a 1:12.8 time.

“I didn't get a chance to Warm
up,” notedthe long-striding Huf-
nagl, who had been broad jump-
ing in Trees Hall prior to the
race. “But I felt good and went
for the record.”

Schorstein prarised Hufna.gl’s
effort. “I wanted to run the 600,
but I doubt if I could have beat-

Before the 600, Hufnagl ﬁn-
ished inches behind Bryant Sal-
ter in the broad jump. Salter,
who set a Field House high
jump record -at 6’8”, was just
one-half inch short of his broad
jump record. He leaped 22’ 11/2".

Salter, who said that he felt
loose after he set the high
jump record, nuged the bar as
he cleared 6'8”, and it was still
quivering moments later as Sal-
ter’s teammates and coach Jim
Banner congratulated him.

In the 60 yard dash, there was
some confusion as t-o who won.

Garnett.

Connell ﬁnally received the
official first place, but the Ohio
U. runner who ﬁnished second,
conﬁrmed douab-ts. “Garnett beat
me,” said the sprinter. Garnett
and Connell were both clocked
in 6.4 seconds.

Rlchey was pushed only by
teammate ‘Mark Vornhagen in

  

the two-mile. Richey’s winning
time of 9:26.6 was well off his
school record of 8:48.4, but he
had just run 4:l5.2 to win the
mile.

Flashy Smitty Brown opened
the meet with a 49.9 win in the
440, setting a frosh record.

LC/agers, Orange Meet Tonight   M

In Battle of Heavy Losers

by MIKE BROURMAN
Assistant Sports Editor
For better or for worse, Panther cage

fans have only two more chances to see

this year’s team at the Field House, includ-

mg t0flight’s game with Syracuse at 9.

The game matches two of the most disap-
pcining teams in -the East. Retiring coach Bo=b
Timmons had hoped to go out with a winner, but
Saturd=ay’s 92-60 loss to Virginia leaves the
cagers with a 6-12 record.

Many people, including writers for the two
national magazines, thought that Syracuse had
the material to be one of the nation's best teams.
But, following a disputed 80-76 loss to West Vir-
ginia. the Orange stand at only 7-13.

After a good start, Syracuse has lost eight
of its last nine games, forcing Lewis to make a.
number of personnel and tactical changes.

For the West Virginia game, he benched last
year's top player, George Hicker, and highly-

rated sophomore Ernie Austin. Lewis also has ,

recently abandoned .his -pressing defense and run-
and-shoot attack in favor of a more patterned
offense.

Lewis’ moves have apparently showed some
results. Syracuse ended a seven game losing
skein by upsetting Cornell and l-ost the close
one to West Virginia on what  described
as officiating that was a “disgrace to college ath-

Lcme, Price Cop Dual Wins
But Swimmers Sink, 75-38

by ART ROSENGARTEN

Seemingly nothing could stir the swim team Saturday
night. Indiana State University (Terre Haute, Ind.) com-
pletely dominated the meet from the opening gun and swamped

the mermen, 75-38. —

“Help, help, help!” -said losing coach Bill Grant shaking his

letics." Four Syracuse starters fouled out.

Hicker may have regained his job with a 23
point effort coming off the bench. He will prob-
ably be joined in the lineup by Vaughn Harper,
the leading scorer and rebounder; two sophs,
big Wayne Ward and guard John Suder; and
playmaker Richie Cornwall.

In contrast to Syracuse's new found ﬁght,
the Panthers lately have resembled Sonny L15.
ton’s performance against Cassius Clay in Lew-
istown, Me.

Virginia toyed with the cagers almost from
the opening seconds of Saturday’s game. They
ripped off 12, and then nine points in a row, and
charged to a 35-19 halftime lead.

The Cavaliers picked up their seventh victory
in 21 games and used the Panthens to establish
some scoring record-s. Among them was a 48 per
cent team shooting performance and 11 assists
by Barry Koval.

Only two cagers broke into double ﬁgures,
Charlie Hunt and Pete Smith with 11 points
apiece. It was the second straight game that
Hunt hit for double ﬁgures and only the third
time this year.

Otherwise it was a routine performance, as
the Panthers shot their usual 26 per cent from
the ﬁeld. Tonight, they'll probably be just the
remedy that Syracuse needs to cure its losing
ways.

in the All-Campus Basketball Tournament ﬁnals. "

Delta Sig, trailing by one point, had rebounded a missed MBA

foul shot and called time out
with nine seconds left to play.
The winners then worked the
ball t-o McCa-in, who swished the
shot.

The game was close through-
out both halves, as neither team
grabbed more than .a six-point
lead. McCain and Kerry Trach-
ak sparked Delta Sig in the
ﬁrst half with 12 and 11 points,
respectively, while Chuck Win-
ters, the team’s leading scorer,
was cold.

MBA’s Bill DiPietro lead all
ﬁrst half scorers with 13, but
Delta Sig held on to a. slim four-
point 32-28 lead at the half.

MBA got four quick points
to open the second half and
knotted the score. Led by Di-
Pietro, the Masters took over
the lead at 38-36 and went ahead
by six points at 42-36. With
MBA still holding a six-point
edge at 48-42, Delta Sig start-

McClain hit for four points,
Mac McElhen-y sank two foul
shots and Winters drove in for

the swimmers swam their best
times of the season only to

come out with another loss,

their seventh of the year. “The
boys gave their all. We came up
against a real hot team who
was just too much for us,”
Grant said.

Saturday's diving competition
was the highlight of the meet.
ISU’s number one diver, jun-
ior Mike Barnhill, gave a diving
exhibition the likes which hasn’t
been seen at Trees Pool since
the days -of Eastern competitor
Dan Hahnfeldt.

Barnhill set new marks on
both the one and three meter
boards. With an assortment of
high degree of difficulty dives,
consisting of multiple summer-

saults and twists. he amassed
scores of 244.40 points on the
low board and 214.10 points on
the high board.

“This was the ﬁnest I have
ever done on the low board,”
said a smiling Barnhill, “But I
blew too many dives on the
three meter boar .”

“I’ have never seen anybody
get so high in the air as Barn-
hill. He's national material,”
added a dejected Dean Coleman,
Barnhill’s opponenrt. Coleman
had one of his worst perform-
ances of the year as he managed
two third places. “The coach ex-
pected two seconds from me, but
I just couldn’t come thro-ugh.”

Catholic Diocese Backing 1
Pittsburgh Jazz Festival

John J. Wright, Bishop of
Pittsburgh, announced today
that the Diocesan Human Rela-
tions Commission will cospon-
sor the 1968 Pittsburgh Jazz Fes-

tzival with the Catholic Youth
Organization «as one of its com-
munity projects.

Arthur Pisula, executive sec-
retary of the HRC stated, “The
commission feels that in the
past four years the Jazz Festi-
vial has been a strong force in
the community of Pittsburgh
for the betterment of interra-
cial relations. It  an honest
cultural event celebrating the
country’s only native art form
and provides an easy, happy sit-
uation for cooperation among

Negroes and whites in the city."
The Festival has in the past
received support from the city's
news media, the general pub-
lic and numerous individuals
who l-ove jazz or feel the impor-
tance of it to the health of an
urban culture. However, it has
had great difficulty being rec-
ognized by Pittsburg.h’s numer-
ous foundations and has ‘run
into continual ﬁnancial deﬁcit
because of requirements of the
Pittsburgh City Amusement
Tax and supervisory personnel.
George T. Wein, creator of
the Newport Festivals will_ pro-
duce the 1968 Festival for the
Catholic Youth Organization and
the Diocesan Human Relations
Commission.

Talk with Newport News On-Campus Career Con

sultant about engineering openings at world's

largest shipbuilding company-—where your future
IS as big as today's brand new ocean.

Our half-a-billion-dollar backlog of orders means high start-
ing salary, career security, with your way up wide open.
It also means scope for all your abilities. We're involved
with nuclear ship propulsion and refueling, nuclear aircraft
carrier and submarine building, marine automation. We've
recently completed a vast oceanographic ore survey. We're
a major builder of giant water power and heavy industrial
equipment. We're starting to apply our nautical nuclear
know-how to the fast expanding field of nuclear electric
power generation. We're completing competitive systems
designs for the Navy's $1 billion plus LHA fleet concept.

Interested in an advanced degree or research? We're next
door to Virginia Associated Research Center with one of
the world's largest synchrocyclotrons, offering advanced
study in high energy physics. We're close to Old Dominion
College and University of Virginia Extension Division, where
you can get credits for a master's degree, or take courses
in Microwave Theory, Solid State Electronics, Nuclear En-
gineering and other advanced subjects. Ask about scholar-
ships, tuition grants, study and research leaves to imple-

ment these opportunities.

Ask, too, about the pleasant living and lower living costs,
here in the heart of Virginia's historic seaside vacation land,
with superb beaches, golf, fishing, boating, ‘hunting. *
