Fumes from Hazelwod blaze loat overOakland

Fumes from yesterday's LTB steel mill fire caused officials to warn Oakland residents to watch exposure to outside.

' By Brendan Kevenides 

Senior Staff Writer

' Residents of the Oakland area
were advised to remain indoors
yesterday due to a fi re at a chem-
ical facility in Hazelwood. Eight
employees of the facility were in-
jured, and nine firefighters were

treated for skin irritation from’

chemical fumes.

Three of the employees were
treated for serious injuries; two
suffered second-degree bu‘rns
over 38 percent of their bodies;
one was traumatized when he fell
an unknown distance; and others
suffered minor injuries.

According tojohn Moon, chief
superintendent for the Bureau of
Emergency Medical Services in

Pittsburgh, the fumes from the fi re .

posed no threat to the surround-
ing community.

”The warning is a precaution-
ary measure which will remain in
effect for an unknown length of
time,” he said. '

Moon said firefighters at the
blaze suffered from skin irritation
because they were exposed to

As the newly appointed Stu-
dent Government Board allo-
cations chairman, Gil Borok is
satisfied with the present allo-
cations system, though he
does see areas of possible im-
provement.

Borok oversees allocations
for the funding provided by
. the $32 student activities fee.

Borok heads a committee
which consists of eight voting
members and three non-voting
members. All committee

SGB allocations chairman named

members are appointed by the
SGB.

The SGB annually receives
50 percent of the total activi-
ties fees, said Borok. He added

- that the remaining percentage

goes to the Pitt Program Coun-
cil and the media board.
According to SGB President
Kent Baldauf, the board
receives appoximately
$380,000 as its annual allot-
ment of the activities fee.
Each March, the allocations
committee reviews the fund-
ing requests of over 100 cam-
pus organizations. The

committee submits recom-
mendations to the board for fi-
nal approval.

Borok said that he would
like to see a change in the way
funding denials are handled.

”We had requests that ex-
ceeded available funds by
$150,000,” he said.

’’I’d like to see the commit-
tee be nicer to these groups,”
Borok added, speaking of or-
ganizations whose requests
were denied. .

”When a denial is "made, it

should be correctly explained

”We are confident that the air
in the area is pure,” Moon said,
referring to air quality readings
taken yesterday near -the site.

THE Pirr NEWS, Tuesday, April 18, 1989

Pa. nuclear reactor reopening approved

WASHINGTON (AP) — Feder-
al officials Monday approved a
restart of the Peach Bottom
nuclear plant in southern Penn-
sylvania, two years after shutting
it down because 33 control—room
operators slept or neglected their
duties. I

The Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission voted 3-0 to lift an order
that had kept the plant closed
since March 31, 1987, when the

commission said its continued-

operation posed .a threat ”to the
health and safety of the public.”

Philadelphia Electric Co.,
which operates the plant, said the
earliest it could restart the plant
is Thursday. About three weeks
after that, the plant would be at
35 percent of power capacity,
said Corbin A. McNei|| Jr., PECO
executive vice president of
nuclear operations.

Plant officials must complete a
checklist of technical items be-
fore beginning the ascension to
full power, which will take sever-
al months and be scrutinized by
NRC inspectors.

The vote followed a presenta-
tion by PECO, which said it had

undergone radical changes since
the NRC issued its shutdown ord-
er following a tip about the sleep-
ing that prompted an
investigation.

Vessel sinks off
coast of Boston

BOSTON (AP) ~ A1500-foot
cargo vessel apparently sank
about 400 miles southeast of
Cape Cod, but all 25 crew mem-
bers were either rescued or seen
in a lifeboat, said a Coast Guard
spokesman.

Another merchant ship sighted
the life rafts from the Star of Alex-
andria, according to Coast Guard
officials.

One raft, containing 23 crew
members, was picked up by the
713-foot cargo‘ vessel Ravencraig,
said Petty Officer Randy Midgett
of the Coast Guard in New York.

The second raft containing two
crew members was spotted, but
the people on board were not yet
picked up, Midgett said.

Coast Guard officials in New

York City heard the distress call _

from the Star of Alexandria at
about 9:05 a.m. Monday. Mem-
bers of the crew reported the ves-
sel began taking on water in
seven-foot seas.

NEWS BRIEFS

aboard, Lt. Matthew Wannamak-

Workers given lea ve
during asbestos check

HARRISBURG (AP) - About
300 Department of Environmen-

tal Resources employees received ,

an unexpected week-long leave
with pay Monday after asbestos
was discovered in their uptown
office building. _

For most of the workers, who
were given the news by DER
Secretary Arthur Davis, that
means a week's vacation since
files and other materials are
sealed inside the building.

”We’re all involved with
projects and people, but our
records are in our offices,” said
Shamus Malone, a natural.
resource specialist for DER, who

commended the state for taking‘
,quick action. -

”l have meetings to go to,
deadlines to meet, people to talk
to. So this week is going to hurt

_ ‘us," Malone said.

The DER recently became
aware of the problem when wor-
kers doing renovations found as-
bestos in various parts of the
building, said DER spokeswom-
an Susan Woods. Asbestos fibers,
which have been ‘linked to
respiratory disorders and cancer,

_,were discovered in dust collect-

ed from ceiling tiles and near
radiators and pipes, she said.

House
approves
assault
measure

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Irate
fans who take their frustration out
on the jaws of sports officials
would face fines of up to $10,000
and five years in prison under
legislation unanimously ap-
proved by the House Monday.

4 The House voted 195-0 on the
legislation that would crack
down on assaults of officials who
oversee sporting events. The
measure now goes to the Senate.

In another vote, the House ap-
proved 129-67 an unrelated
amendment to the bill that would
raise the minimum age for buy-
ing tobacco products from 16 to
18. That vote was 129 to 67.

The bill targets people who as-
sault a referee, trainer, athletic
director, school administrator, or
their assistants during a scholas-
tic or professional sporting event.

Rep. Richard Olasz, the Al-
legheny County Democrat who
sponsored the bill, said sports
officials have been seriously in-
jured by fans angered over the
result of a sporting event.

”A sporting event should be
just that, a sporting event,” Olasz
said after the vote.

”We have officials to protect
everyone except the referees.
Everybody roots for the team, but
nobody roots for the zebras,” he

said.

Olasz said the fine and prison
sentence should dissuade people
from beating up on sports
officials.

”When people find out how
costly it is to go out and attack
officials, hopefully it will act as a
deterrent,” he said.

Officials have suffered not only
physical injury at the hands of

fans, but also damage to their per- '

sonal property including automo-
biles and homes.

Rep. George Saurman, R-
Montgomery, sponsored the
tobacco bill.

Hotline soon to be in service

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Attempting to fight crime by
”opening up the lines of commu-
nication,” Director of Public Safe-
ty William Brennan has set up
new programs, including a hot-
line, to start next week.

The hotline, which will be in
effect on April 24, will run direct-
ly into the communications room
of the Campus Police depart-
ment. Brennan said that students
can call for several different
reasons.

”All they have to do is dial
624-4HLP, and they will get as-

sistance," he said. ’’If they need
an escort, if they need directions
somewhere, if they have car trou-
ble, they can find the help they
need by calling this number.”

Brennan stressed that the hot-
line should not be confused with
the emergency line.

”The hotline is not a substitute
for emergency calls. For an emer-
gency on campus, people should
still call 624-2121,” he said.

When calls are made, they will
be recorded in a log book. The
next day, members of the ”con—
tact team” will follow up on the
calls, to investigate suspicious ac-
tivity or make sure individuals’

needs have been met.

The contact team program will
also start on April 24. Every
month, two officers will be select-
ed to meet with community
groups to keep the Campus
Police in better contact with the
university population.

”All of my officers will go
through this program,” Brennan
said. ’’It will take a couple of
years to complete. Hopefully,
they will take what they learn on
the Contact team and apply it
when they return to their regular
duties.”

Officers Mark A. Smith and Ka-
ren McKee Jones are on the first _
contact team. This week, they are
undergoing 40 hours of commu-
nity relations training at Alleghe-
ny County Police Academy.
Brennan said that they may be
kept on special duty to train fu-
ture contact teams.

”lt will take a little while to get
it going smoothly,” Brennan said,
”but hopefully the program will
be running efficiently by the time
the new school year starts in Sep-
tember."

Another program Brennan will
unveil next week is the ”obser—
vation forms,” which will be dis-
tributed across campus by the
contact team. If students see any
suspicious activity, they can fill
out a form. .

Eventually there will be special
drop—off boxes for the forms,_ but
until then they can be sent
through campus mail. The reports
will be stored on a data base, and
will be used to discover crime
trends in the Oakland area.

”We are trying to generate in-
formation through the forms,”
Brennan said. ”This way, we can
give people the chance to report
suspicious activity while remain-
ing anonymous..”

Pens win 4-3, take 1-0 series lead over Flyers

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

Rob Brown took Kevin Stevens’
pass from behind the net and
scored from the slot with 6:34_ re-
maining as the Pittsburgh Pen-
guins rallied to beat the
Philadelphia Flyers 4-3 Monday
night in the opener of the Patrick
Division finals.

The Penguins, outshot at one
point 20-6 and trailing 3-1, got
goals from Dan Quinn and John
Cullen just 33 seconds apart in

%

the second period. They then
rode Tom Barrasso’s clutch
goaltending to score their fifth
consecutive playoff victory and
their ninth win in their last 10
games, counting the regular
season.

The Penguins, absent from the
NHL playoffs for six straight
years, swept their first-round ser-
ies from the New York Rangers to
advance to the second round for
the first time in 10 years. Philadel-
phia beat Washington.

Pitt gave its best performance of the year in Knoxville.
Cioffi hitting well again
for Pitt baseball team

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

For Chris Cioffi, a Pitt baseball
player, taking risks is a way of
life. - '

”I like to take chances, to gam-
ble,” said Cioffi, a junior second
baseman. ”Even coming here
was a gamble. I just thought if I
worked hard, in both baseball
and the classroom, everything
would work out fine.”

The Knoxville, Tenn., native
transferred to Pitt from the
University of Tennessee two
years ago. '

”About a year before I came
here, I visited the campus,” Cioffi
said. ’’I just wanted to get away
from home. I was ready for a
change/’

One change for Cioffi this sea-
son was being named a tri-
captain. A

”It was an honor, especially
since the players voted,” said
Cioffi. ”It was even more of an
honor since I'm only a junior.”

In his new role as a team cap-
tain, Cioffi must assume team
leadership responsibilities. He

‘ must be able to relate to both the

team and the coaches.

”In some circumstances, I
represent the coaches,” said
Cioffi. "Then I take whatever the
tea'm tells me  how they feel

about something and I relate that.

back to the coaches.”

.«.'~:;‘4   1. .':.,~ .  Z

Last year'Cioffi played in all of
the Panthers’ 29 games, batting
.364 and tying for a team-high 18
RBI.

This year, Cioffi continues to
do well. In the Big East, he is bat-
ting .313, with an overall average
of .253.

Still, Cioffi ‘believes he has
room for improvement.

”I never-really feel that my bat-

ting average is as high as it should

be,” said Cioffi. ”I always try to
improve.”

This attitude also applies to
Cioffi’s defense. He committed
only two errors in 108 chances
last season, for a .981 fielding
percentage, one of the highest on
the team. . ~ »

Coach Bobby Lewis is the per-
son Cioffi credits with helping
him in his career.

’’I transferred at the last
minute,” said Cioffi. ”Coach
Lewis made my transition from
one school to another an easy
one.”

One goal that Cioffi has for this
season is to make the All-Big East
Conference.

With Cioffi’s attitude and abil-
ities, that goal could

come a reality. .

goaltender Ron Hextall made
four spectacular saves earlier in
the period’ to keep the Penguins

’ from blowing open the game, the

first playoff meeting between the
cross-state rivals in their 22 years
of existence. .

The Flyers, keepingthe puck i
their attacking zone for most of
the first 30 minutes, scored three
special team goals.

But the Penguins tied it behind
a Quinn—led second line.

Quinn took a shot by Zarley

Zalapski off the back boards and
scored on a power play at 7:44
with Hextall out of the crease.
The Penguins were held without
a shot for the first 5:16 of the
period.

Cullen tied it at 8:17, skating
from behind the net to slip the
puck between Hextall’s legs after
Jim Johnson intercepted Hextall’s
clearing pass.

The Flyers had taken a 1-0 lead
on Dave Poulin’s goal at 10:01 of

Tracksters ha vebest outing of the

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

Despite cold and rainy condi-
tions, both the men's and wom-
en's Pitt track teams performed
well at the Dogwood Relays held
in Knoxville, Tenn., last
weekend.

The Dogwood Relays is one of
the biggest meets held in the
spring to prepare for upcoming
conference championships. The
meet boasts about 100 schools,
including the best teams from the
Big East, Big Ten and the SEC
conference. Approximately 3,000

' athletes participated.

”That was our best perfor-
mance of the year,” said men's
track coach John Vasvary. ”Our
kids did a great job, especially
considering the level of compe-
tition. I was really pleased with
the way all our kids ran.”

Eric Cannon, senior hurdler,
qualified for the NCAA champi-
onship‘ meet by winning the
1 10-meter hurdles event in a time
of 13.77. This is the third year in
a row Cannon has qualified for

the NCAA outdoor track champi-
onship meet.

_ Pitt also won the sprint medley
event with a time of 3:18.96, just
missing a school record. The
team consisted of Sam Rice, Neil
Malobicky, Dave Price and Dave
Moore. -

The Panthers also took first in
the 4x800 relay with a time of
7:24.05. Tony Brookover, Chris
Nauman, Tom Boggan and
Moore made up the winning
team.

Cannon was the anchor-runner
of the Pitt second-place shuttle
hurdle relay team. Brett Shields,
Chop Burton and Elbert Ellis ran
with Cannon.

Ellis qualified for the IC4A meet
(Eastern’Championships) in the
110 hurdles. He ran the event in
14.29, good for second place.

Paul Friedrich also qualified for
the IC4A meet in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase event. He covered
the distance in 9:02.20.

The competition was just as
tough for the women, and they
also came up with some high
places and IC4A qualifiers.

year; Cannon qualifies for N CAAs

”The Dogwood Relays is such

a huge meet that just scoring in-

the finals is a pretty big feat,” said
Pitt women's coach Steve Lewis.
Pitt had three qualifiers for the

women's IC4A meet in the 100 ‘-

hurdle event.
Debbie Bonner ran the 100

hurdle_race in 14.09 to qualify.’

Lou Ann Harris and Clarissa Dud-
ley also qualified.

Dudley also placed second for .

Pitt in the heptathalon by scoring
4,830 points.

Keisha Demas took second in
the 400 run for Pitt. She ran the
event in 53.60.

Demas, Dudley, and Bonner
joined with Ardy Hope to place
third in the 4x400 relay.

Hope, Alexis Archer, Vanessa"
, Jones and Tonia Suber scored
well in the 4x100 relay. The

4x200 relay team of Hope, Jones,
Suber, and Nicolle McKenzie
also placed for Pitt.

Other highlights for Pitt's wom-.  i‘ v
en's track team included Gloria.

Kaplan out

to keep
starting
position

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

Pitt placekicker Scott Kaplan
has accomplished a feat that few
freshmen are able to achieve. The

rookie from Coral Springs, Fla., .

earned a starting position on Pitt's

Division I-A football team.
Now, with a year's experience

under his belt and the new kick-

ing rule — the NCAA has banned,

kicking tees — Kaplan feels more
at home on the field.
”I’m more comfortable with

this new style,” said Kaplan. "I'm I

getting a second wind. Kicking
has become a new challenge.”
It could be said that Kaplan is

no stranger to challenges. At the I

beginning of last season, he had

to battIejuniorJeffVanHorne for .~ I

the starting kicking job.

Kaplan got his chance during
the third game of the 1988 sea-
son against West Virginia, when
VanHorne took over the punting

duties and Kaplan handled the

kickoffs. Ironically, that was the

only game that KapIan’s family

‘was able to attend.

Early in the second quarter, ‘

VanHorne missed a 32-yard field

goal attempt. The next kicking _

opportunity was an extra point.

Kaplan got the call, converted the I
PAT and never relinquished the _
kicking duties. In the third quart- V

er, he kicked a 34-yard field goal.

But this wasn't the most
memorable game of the season , V
for Kaplan. That would be the :g

game against Notre Dame.

”The score was 17-14 in the
third quarter,” said Kaplan. ’’It

was on national television with a
crowd of more than 50,000 when

I hit a 44-yard field goal to tie the '

game." That 44-yard field goal
was Kap|an’s longest of the sea-
son. He connected on 10 of 15
field goals Iastseason and all 23
extra-point attempts. He was also
-named to The Sporting News
Freshman Honor Roll.

But Kaplan, a broadcast jour-

nalism major, isn't satisfied. He

has set several goals for himself

to achieve over the next few

years. ' »
’’I’d like to make 100 perce

of my field goals," said Kaplan.

”My eventual goal is to be an All- .

American, and I'm willing to put
in what it takes to make that goal
a reality.” -

This attitude has evolved from   “
- his relationship with two of the .

most influential people in ‘his

career, his high school coach and ‘ ‘
his father. s ’
”My coach, Nick Gancitano‘, ,
helped me with my kicking _.
style," Kaplan said. ”And my _,

father has supported me in every-

thing I do. Without eitherone, I.  

wouldn't be here."

And without either one, the I 
poeple of_Coral Springs wouldn't _A ~ -

Coral Springs High School. He

won the 19873 Silver Knight  
Award for Athletes for combining _ , '

be a part of the Pittsburgh com-

munity after visiting the Pitt cam- ’ I "

pus during the 1987 football
season. U _ P

Bush's payment plan

for Polish democracy

George Bush has decided to reward Poland for the
reforms that are making its governmental system more
democratic by presenting it with an economic package
that could total $1 billion in loans, rescheduling of
loans, and trade and investment relief. The package is
arranged so that Polandwill only receive the aid if it
implements the reforms that the government announced
earlier this month, such as the creation of a two-house
parliament (the first free election of a legislature in the
Eastern bloc). The package is also designed to promote
economic change and encourage a. liberalization of Pol-

ish trade markets.

It’s nice that Bush wants to encourage democracy;
obviously he, like most Americans, feels that democracy
is a good thing that deserves encouragement.

But we are speaking here of $1 billion in aid. With
a deficit in the trillions, that may seem like spare change
to the administration, but it isn't. It is a hell of a lot of

money.

In America, there are a great many people who could
be helped by this money. Considering that the social
services are hurting, the arts are severely underfunded
and that education is more and more expensive every
year (witness Pitt's projected tuition hike), it seems that V

‘this billion dollars could be better used elsewhere.

Republicans are very concerned with the state of the »
world. This iscommendable. But every year, a great
deal of money is spent trying to ”improve” the ways
of life of the citizens of many nations other than our
own. Sometimes in the form of gentle persuasion, such
as this economic gift to Poland, sometimes in a more ~
strident form, such as the aid given to theNicaraguan
Contras. More attention needs to be paid to the Ameri-
can standard of living, and how our lives can be made
better with our’own tax money. i I

When I transferred from Penn
State, I never thought I'd make it
this far, but I have finally finished
two whole semesters at Pitt.

This year has been nothing less
than hectic, but as I approach the
summer, I know I have a wealth

The darkening face of the news  

The world we live in....

0 Last week was a bit rough for
the left wing, as liberals mourned
the death of Abbie Hoffman and
faced the scandal surrounding
Speaker of the House Jim Wright.
Wright has fallen under scrutiny
for private dealings that may have

K been a little less than honest un-

der the congressional ethics
code. Personally, I've always
thought that congressional moral
standards are too high anyway.

decided to ‘let Oliver North go

0 Some say there are just too

Q many people on this tired, old
5 planet and not enough necessities
' to go around. But Satan worship-

pers in Mexico have taken steps
toward solving that problem. And
in an age of apathy...

0 Locally, our beloved mayor,
Sophie Masloff —. you remember,
she was on The Pat Saiak Show
—— has decided that maybe Pitts-.

0 On a television spot to push
local broadcast journalists Mike
and Edye, an announcer claims

that when people come home at_

night, they want to know what
the rest of the world's been up to.
My question is, why?

Though there's quite a differ-
ence between MacNeil/Lehrer
and Patti Burns, the news is basi-
cally the same. And excluding a
few fluffy animal bits and medi-
cal breakthroughs, it's basically
bad.

So why do we‘ bother with the _'

news at all? . - _

It's certainly not that -we're pas-
sionate about today’s issues and
want to change the world.

‘First of all, anyone concerned
with righting the wrongs of the
world would have come out of
hiding long ago. At this point, our
world is so diseased that a mer-
ciful god would perform eu-
thanasia.

Second, a recent census shows
that with the death of Abbie Hoff-
man, there are only seven revolu-
tionaries alive today.

What keeps the rest of us in-
terested? ,

A friend suggested to me that
we want» to be sure there are

others less fortunate than our-

selves. Perhaps we fear making
the headlines as one of the

else’s picture on the front page.

This is a disturbing but logical
possibility. It fits sort of comfort-
ably into the twisted scheme of ‘-
things. Twisted as opposed to_
what? Good question.

Maybe that's just it; Maybe the _
state of our world doesn't shock ..
us because it's been moving
along the same foul course for -so
long now. 

It's ‘understandable in a way, 
the fact that we watch without 
alarm. The stories aren't actually.‘ ,

leaders can be unscrupulous.‘ We ';ii;, ’

”The first thing that struck me
was the people,” he said. ”|t’s
slower up here and more relaxed
than in Florida.

”Up here,” according to
Kaplan, football is more promi-
nent than in his home state, just
as it is where his football career
was launched when he was 9
years old.

’’I was living in Colorado at the
time, and that's what all of my
buddies were playing," said
Kaplan. ’’I had been playing soc-
cer, and kicking came naturally
after that.”

Kicking, for the upcoming sea-
son will once again involve
Kaplan and Van Horne competing
for the starting position, with one
difference. This year, the _shoe’s
on the other foot, so to speak, be-
cause VanHorne will be trying to
take the job away from Kaplan.

’’I don't know ifleff and I have
a rivalry, but whatever it is, it's
friendly,” said Kaplan. ”It keeps
us both working hard and makes
us better kickers and better
people.”

Louis’ victory Saturday, his
second hit setting up the win-
ning run in the 10th inning.
On Sunday, after the Cardinals
trailed 2-0, his three singles ig-
nited another comeback. 3

It wasn't until shortly before
Saturday's nationally televised
game that team physician Stan
London gave Smith permis-
sion to play.

’’Actually, it was about five
minutes before the game,”
Smith said. ’’I told Dr. London
that I'd done all the things that
he'd asked me to do —- throw
on the run, turn the double
play and all those things, and
I didn't feel any pain.”

_Still, Manager Whitey Her-
zog had reservations about
Smith being ready.

”The doctor said he was all
right, but you always worry,”
Herzog said. ”[But] the first
play he made he landed on his
side. If he didn't get hurt, then
he's not going to get hurt.”

Smith said he did nothing_

extraordinary in his rehabili-
tation.

”l’ve been riding a [station-
ary] bike, which is the only
thing that I could have done,”
he said.

First baseman Pedro Guer-
rero said Smith’s return, which
sent fill-in Jose Oquendo back
to second base, boosted St.
Louis’ mood.

”|t’s a lot different for us
with Ozzie at shortstop and
Oquendo at second base,”
Guerrero said. ’’It seemed like
we went out there to win the
game. We battled to extra in-
nings, and we played great
defense.”

Smith, after a postgame rub-
down he received at home
Saturday night from his wife,
came back Sunday with a two-
RBI performance.

”As long as I can play
without any pain, then every-
thing is fine,” Smith said. ’’I
guess it goes to show that win-
ning is much more than really

hopefully I did that.

”When you play a ballclub
such as the Mets, with their
outstanding pitching, anytime
that you can beat them it's
very positive,” Smith said.
”Ourgoal right now is to try
to win as many games on this
home stand as we can. I think
that will give us a big boost.”
