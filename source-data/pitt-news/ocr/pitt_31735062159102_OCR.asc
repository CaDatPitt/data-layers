On A Program

Of War Propaganda

By ROBERT SAFFRON ,

Through a _friend in \V ash-
ington, I have come into pos-
session of information concern-
ing the national administra-
tio11’s preparations for war.
This news has leaked out from
high government sources and is
absolutely reliable. Subsequent
events and situations in. the last
few days have tended to conﬁrm
the following:

Several weeks ago army offi-

cers with the rank of General,
naval officers with the rank of
Admiral, representatives of some
of the country’s greatest ﬁnancial
interests, members of the State
department staﬁ, and the editor of
an inﬂuential newspaper met in
New York. This melodramatic-
sounding group decided upon a
campaign of education to prepare
the minds of the American people
for a foreign war “if necessary.”

A two-fold appeal, based upon
incidents like the Panay sinking,
will be used—(a) patriotic: in-
sistence upon the rights of Amer-
ican citizens and property to im-
munity in war zones; (b) idealis-
tic: defend the sancity of treaties,
for peace, for democracy.

In spite of public denial, Cap-

tain Royal Ingersoll, head of
the naval War Plans Division, af-
ter a three weeks conference with
the British Admirality, did arrive
at an agreement for American
“parallel action” with the British
ﬂeet. This understanding provides
that, if Japan extends her block-
ade of China to the British port of
Hong Kong, the U. S. and England
will break that blockade.

America will furnish 15 ﬁghting
craft and auxiliary vessels, and
the British, six. The two ﬂeets,
then (in Roosevelt’s words) would
"roll the Japanese navy all the
way up the China coast.”

(Note the participation of three
American cruisers in the British
maneuvers at Singapore —— the
formation flights of bombers to
Hawaii-—the cancellation of all
leaves for naval ojficers—the
forthcoming American w a r
games, with the fleet practicing
in the Pacific from Alaska all the
way to Samoa. The Navy has
banred newspapermen from the
maneuvers of the 150 fighting
craft carrying 50,000 men and of-

ficers.)
3 The American Legion will op-
pose the Ludlow war referen-
dum bill and the administration
will, in. return, support the Shep-
pard-Hill industrial mobilization
bill, the Legion’s pet project, under
which men, at declaration of war,
would work under ﬁxed conditions
and wages, or be ﬁned $100,000,
and bosses would all be army offi-

cers.
4 Several men in the army high

command are opposed to Roose-
velt’s super-navy and predict “hu-
miliation and defeat for any
American army in the Far East.”
5 Roosevelt has more recently

conferred with four leading
newspaper publishers ’ and told
them that this nation must be uni-
ﬂed by war scares in order to per-
mit a stronger policy in the Far
East. One of his statements was:
“This nation used to be ready to
ﬁght at the drop of a hat and we
must get it that way again.”

At another meeting with labor

leaders, which included Wil-
liam Green and a person close to
John L. Lewis, President Roose-
velt protested labor support of the
Ludlow amendment. He empha-
sized the need for labor unity “in
view of possible police action in
the Far East” and to “scare the
pants off Japan.” (The quotes are
attributed to Roosevelt.)

Keep these six points in mind as
the war scare spreads.

Band, Singers
Will Broadcast

Members of the University band
and Glee Club will go on the air
over the National Broadcasting
company’s network when they
broadcast in conjunction with the
Charter Day Ball Monday.

The broadcast, from the Ball-
room of the Hotel Schenley, will
be part of a nation-wide commem-
oration of the 151st anniversary
of the founding of the University.

Several of the University songs,
arranged by Theodore M. Finney,
director of the Band, will be pre-
sented during the program.

According to Earl Crawford,
BA16, Chancellor John G. Bow-
man probably will speak on the
program, together with Norman
MacLeod, president of the Gener-
al Alumni Association; and Dr.
John B. Sutherland, head football
coach.

The ball is sponsored by the
Alumni Association. Attendance
will be limited to 300 couples.

Forum To Consider
J apanes Boycott

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, FRIDAY, rmiéitunizv 25, 1938

Students Debate 

Vital Issue Today
For SFA Group
Anti-Japanese boycotts will
be the subject of discussion by
four student speakers at the
Student - Faculty Association
Forum in 24 Cathedral this
afternoon at 1 o’clock.
VVilliam Stark, C38, and
Bernard McKenna, C39, form
the affirmative side for considera-
tion of “Anti-Japanese Boycott:
Pro and Con.” The negative will
be discussed by Joseph McClos-

key, C38, and Donald'Dammond,
C38.

COUNCIL BOYCOTT
“Interest in the Forum today
has been heightened,” said Milton
Lehman, C39, chairman of the ser-
ies of meetings, “by the numerous
boycotts started throughout the

country. In particular, the ques-
tion is commanding attention at

the University since an anti-Jap-
anese boycott was instituted last
week by the Pitt Peace Confer-
ence.

Lehman stated that some differ-
ences of opinion had been evi-
denced among students and teach-
ers regarding the effect of anti-

Japanese boycotts. He believes
that the discussion today will pre-
sent intelligent viewpoints on both
sides of the argument, besides al-
lowing for questions from students
and teachers attending the meet-
mg.

VETERAN DEBATERS

Stark and McKenna, the afﬁrm-
ative speakers, are both veteran
members of the University debat-
ing team. Besides being debate
manager, Stark is head of the
University delegation to the In-
tercollegiate Conference on Gov-
ernment. He and McKenna are
members of SFA, and took part in
the Intercollegiate Peace Confer-
ence Tuesday.

McCloskey and Dammond, not
members of the debating team,
have for some time been interest-
ed observers of the Sino-Japanese
conﬂict, and the United States
concern in the quarrel. McClos—
key, columnist for The Pitt News,
is a history major, and is presi-
dent of Pi Tau Phi, honorary
scholastic fraternity.

Men’s Council

Will Present
Panther Pins

Freshmen will have an oppor-
tunity to go on the “gold stand-
ard” Tuesday when customs ex-
aminations are given the ﬁrst se-
mester students.

Men’s Council’s customs com-
mittee, headed by Bob Simrell,
BA39, will award gold Panther
pins to the ﬁrst semester men who
receive grades of '70 or better on
the test. The pins will replace
the green buttons now worn by
new freshmen.

Freshmen will take the exams
during their regular ﬁrst or sixth
hour orientation class periods
Tuesday. Engineering students
have been sent notices by Robert
R. Corley, assistant dean of men,
advising them to take the tests
during the regular hours if possi-
ble, or make arrangements
through his ofﬁce for some other
time Tuesday.

The customs examinations are
based on material found largely in
the Pitt‘Compass. This includes
knowledge of the University his-
tory, buildings, administration
leaders, songs and cheers, activi-
ties and activities leaders.

Quill Club Meets

Quill Club will meet this after-
nooniat 2 o’clock in 339 Cathedral
to consider manuscripts submit-
ted for Scholar’s Day tapping.
Deadline on manuscripts submit-
ted to Quill Club is today at noon.

Engineer To Review
Progress Of Flood,
Control In Pittsburgh

Lieutenant-Colonel W. E. R.
Covell, district U. S. engineer, will
discuss “Flood Control” at a meet-
ing of Inquiry Forum Monday at
12:30 o’clock in 129 Cathedral.

Colonel Covell, who is in charge
of the Pittsburgh office of the
army engineers, will review ﬂood
control progress in the district,
which he has been directing since
the record ﬂood of 1936. He willi
also explain other phases of the
general ﬂood problem locally and
nationally.

Since his graduation from the
U. S. Military Academy in 1915,
Colonel Covell has risen rapidly
in rank. In 1918, at the age of 25,
he was active commander of the
second engineers of the AEF—the
youngest man ever to hold such

a post.
After the Armistice, he was
stationed in Washington, from

which post he was transferred to
the Canal Zone as assistant engi-
neer in charge of canal mainten-
ance.

He was appointed to his present
post on May 9, 1936, shortly after
the record 46-foot ﬂood had re-
ceded. At this time political and
civic pressure for ﬂood control
measures was strong, and Colonel
Covell was put in command of
preliminary ﬂood control work in
the Allegheny-Monongahela basin.

HONORARIES TAP

All undergraduates are invited
to attend the traditional exercises,
the feature of which is the tapping
of students to honor societies and
the distribution of special awards
and scholarships. Sixteen socie-
ties will tap. Awards will fall in-
to eight major groups.

Dr. Laing, who has long been
active as an educator, has received
an A. B. from the University of
Toronto, holds a Ph.D. from John
Hopkins, and has been awarded
LL.D. degrees from the University
of Western Ontario and from the
University.

LIANG IS AUTHOR

The author of “Survivals of
Roman Religion” and the editor of
“Masterpieces of Latin Litera-
ture” and “Selections from Ovid,”
Dr. Laing has been a frequent
contributor to philological publica-
tions.

Heading the undergraduate com-
mittee for Scholars,’__,D)ay,‘ Stark and
his group are working on arrange-
ments with Dr. Vincent W. Lan-
fear, dean of men and general
chairman. Members of Stark’s
committee are Ruth Boyd, C39;

Men’s Bushing

To End Sunday

Fraternity rushing season for
men continues today and tomor-
row with silence period for rushees
scheduled to begin at 2 a. m. Sun-
day.

Dances at all of the 13 men’s so-
cial fraternities tomorrow even-
ing will conclude the rushing pro-
grams which started Thursday
morning. According to Charles
Wright, C38, president of Inter-
fraternity Council, rushees must
have left fraternity houses before
the silence period begins.

Silence period will last until
next Thursday afternoon at 5
o’clock when newly-pledged fra-
ternity members will go to their
houses for dinner. Freshmen will
inform the office of the dean of
men of their decision as to pledg-
ing after 9 o’clock next Tuesday
morning.

General Conclave In Memorial Hall

A general assembly for all University students, the first

in Memorial Hall.

Although the topic of his address has not‘ been announced,

Smith Releases Panther Reins
To Kalwary—-But Not For Keeps

Issue On Sale Today
To Feature Column
On Swing Musicians

By ROBERT BROWN

There’s no need to tell you that
the February issue of the Panther
is out, because 99 per cent of the
students at the University get
their elevator on the basement
ﬂoor, and that’s where the Panther
salesmen are. This issue is differ-
ent, of course, but it’s different in
that S. Sidney Kalwary, C40, is
issue editor.

BARNES ON SWING

Since credit belongs where cred-
it is due, it’s only fair to give a
plug to Jean Barnes, who handles
the swing department of the mag-
azint. Miss Barnes taps her foot
with dainty impartiality to Greig
or Goodman, but she can also
write well about either one, and
that is something.

This month’s column is devoted
to three Pittsburgh swing music-
ians, Earl Hines, Mary Lou Wil-
liams, and Don Redman. Miss
Barnes concludes that they are
capable of swinging on down with
the majority of big bands in the
country. Bernie Cashdollar also
swings, but in a different key.

SMITH EDITORIAL

Tom Smith, in his editorial,
“Suckers,” toys with a different
type of ﬁgures than the kind he
puts on his layout page for the
style section, and it is not difficult
to see that he opposes the Jap-
anese boycott. His point is that
America is being subjected to the
same subtle type of propaganda
that plunged the country into war
20 years ago.

Then, there is poetry by Estell
Kovas, William Colker, Gertrude
Lieblich, and Alice Benovitz. A
fantasy (I suppose it’s a fantasy)
is the contribution of a faculty
member who can be recognized by
the fact that he always looks out
the window when he cracks his
puns.

Also featured is an interview
with Sibyl Bowman, dancer, who
can talk; cartoons; campus gossip,
and a cover by Frank Kristufek.

That’s all, except that the mag-
azine sells for 15 cents.

from 9 till 1 o’clock.

This dance breaks the usual
precedent of the Association,
which previously has sponsored
two dances each semester, one in-
formal and one formal. A crowd-

ent to cancel one dance this se-
mester.

Proﬁts from this dance, as from
all CA dances, will go into the
Association’s student loan fund, to
aid worthy and needy students.

Paul Pendarvis
To Play Tunes
For I-F Ball

Chairman Nordstrom
Announces Bill Penn
Location For Formal

Paul Pendarvis and his orches-
tra have been selected to play for
the annual Interfraoernity Ball at
the William Penn Hotel March 11.
Ray Nordstrom, Min38, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, chairman of the
dance, has announced.

Bandleader Pendarvis previous-
ly played three different engage-
ments at the William Penn and
gained a large local following
while he was at the Urban Room.
He is‘ traveling east to New York,
coming from a long engagement
at Palace hotel in San Francisco.

Andy Moifatt, BA38, Kappa Sig-
ma, business manager, has allotted
the tickets to the fraternity
houses, where they go on sale be-
fore the general sale to the stu-
dent body begins.

The Interfraternity Ball is a
formal dance, second to the two
sponsored each school year by In-
terfraternity Council. The tradi-
tional policy is to import a na-
tionally known orchestra. Coun-
cil’s other dance is the Yuletide
Festival, an informal dance held
just previous to the Christmas
recess.

Favors will be included in the
admission price of four dollars per
couple. “Favors,” Nordstrom said,
“will be something really worth-
while.”

Nordstrom and Moffatt are as-
sisted by a committee composed
of one man from each of the 13
fraternities in Council.

Socidlogy Group

According to Miss Frances Mc-
Laughlin, assistant dean of wo-
men, the date for the social serv-
ice meeting for junior and senior
women in 113 Cathedral has been
changed from March 9 to March 2.

This is the ﬁrst in the series of
ﬁve meetings sponsored by the
Vocational Information commit-
tee of WSGA this semester.

of vital interest to students are
expected to be included.

All classes this morning have
been shortened to 45 minutes
each. No classes will be in ses-
sion during the assembly period.

SFA REQUEST

Today's assembly is probably
the outgrowth of a request made
to Dr. Bowman at the ﬁrst meet-
ing of the Student-Faculty Asso-
ciotion this year. At that meeting
the assembly passed a resolution
requesting Dr. Bowman to address
the entire student body this year
to “present his ideas of the spirit
of the University.”

At this ﬁrst SFA meeting, Dr.
Bowman told the members of the
assembly that student appreciation
of the spirit of the University, as
exempliﬁed by the Cathedral,
would serve as incentive for a
“new kind of education.”

COMIVIITTEE LISTED

According to popular rumor,
Dr. Bowman will introduce to the
student body Rufus Fitzgerald,
University provost, who arrived
from the University of Iowa at the
beginning of this semester.

The SFA committee, which has
made preparations for the session,
urges all students to attend to-
day’s assembly. The committee
consists of John Baker, BA38,
chairman; Al Kairys, BA39; Ruth
Manns, C40; Muriel Lowy, C40;
Dan Cannon, C41; and Miss Thyr-
sa W. Amos, dean of women.

On Scenarios

Holding their ﬁrst discussion
meeting, Wednesday afternoon,
the scenario-writing group of the
new experimental movie spon-
sored by the University ﬁne arts
department considered possible
themes for the picture.

Students, under the direction
of faculty men, will play the ma-
jor part in the writing, acting and
photographic work involved in
this “all—University” production.

Simplicity, photographic pos-
sibilities, and school material
we;e stressed at th» meeting.

Work on the actual writing of the
scenario will be undertaken im-
mediately after the many ideas
submitted have been sifted and
compounded into a satisfactory
working theme, according to
Frederick P. Mayer, associate pro-
fessor of English, who is in charge
of the scenario work.

When the scenario has been
‘completed, the photographic staff
under Philip C. Elliott, assistant
professor of ﬁne arts, and the act-
ing unit, under Charles Foreman,
graduate student assistant in Eng-
lish, will begin the actual making
of the movie.

It’s To Memorial Hall
This Morning

ISTORY, we suspect, will be made this

inoriiing when Chancellor Bowman steps

out on the l\”lemorial Hall rostrum to deliver
his address to the student body.

Although the subject matter has 11ot deﬁn-
itely been revealed, this meeting will no doubt
set a prece(lent——one of the few times that the
C‘liai::':(-ll<n' lias spoken to the entire student
l=.«~./‘-;_v ‘-.‘.'i1(f-ll a trophy presentation wasn’t in
1 l (ll-.’—‘l'.

l’\(‘l'll;l§)S-, since the University’s 151st anni-
versaigv nears, Dr. Bowinan’s subject may be a
riglitful aggrandizement of the University.
Possibly he will delve deeper, pour out some of
his philosophy of education, and show how it
has been applied at the University.

‘We won’t' presume to suggest what Dr. Bow-
man should or will discuss this morning. Since
it has not been revealed to us, we have had rea-
son to speculate. VVG know the Chancellor will
have an interested audience, and so the rest
will be up to him.

It Just Didn’t
Happen Here
A Note Of Tolerance

Recognition of the Syracuse American Stu-
dent union by the campus organizations coin-
inittee of the men’s student government "Wed-
nesday strikes a new and refreshing note of
liberal tolerance. 7,

'l‘he unanimous decision of a committee of
highly respected students was not made with-
out reservation. Despite stereotyped protests
that recognition of the Union means the ac-
ceptance of “Coinmunisin” on campus, the
committee examined the local structure and
granted it recognition on what was deemed a
justiﬁable basis. Reservations were also made
for the control of the organization. That is
the essence of good government and is a com-
mendable tribute to the governmental integrity
of the new men ’s organization.

The decisive factor in legitiinizing the Sy-
racuse Union was the complete autonomy
granted the local group by the national organ-
ization with which it is affiliated. In the con-
stitution of the Syracuse Union it is declared
that the local group has full control of its own
actions and policies. It is not compelled to ac-
cept policies imposed upon it by any govern-
ing board other than its own.

If a. horriﬁed and uninformed reactionary
sees “danger” in the move he may be coin-
forted by the simplicity of checks imposed
upon the local organization. Disapproval of
its action could be enforced by rescinding the
charter as a comparatively simple government-y
al move. In addition the University reserves,
the right to expel any student on preemptory
charges. This is certainly protection for the
most imaginative of people.

Much more signiﬁcant than the technical
recognition is the vote of conﬁdence accorded
members of the local union. The govern-
ment’s action is its expression of trust in the
attitudes, actions, and discretion of Syracuse
Union members.

Editor, The Pitt News: ,

Mr. Lester Hamburg, in his letter of last Wed-
nesday to the Editor, was irrelevant, incompetent,
and immaterial in his arguments ﬂung at the Amer-

 

‘ ican Student Union.

He implied that the ASU was an organization
based on propaganda. A professor of mine once
said, and rightly so, that material presented by
groups harboring opposite views than yourself
ceases to present educational matter and its ideas
become propaganda. ‘

I am sure that any opinions which were expressed
by Mr. Robert Saffron were understood and clearly
put by him to be his opinions and not the expres-
sions of the University.

THE PITT NEWS

Barnestorm

By jean Barnes

Every once in a while I read a book—partly to
consume time, partly "to amuse myself, and ‘partly
to prove to the gene "31 public that I canlread.

And every once in a while I read a book and
rave about it. This doesn’t really happen often
enough to put a price on my head, but when I start
raving, there isn’t much to do about it unless you
have a pocketfull of knives, gags and arsenic.

A Book To Read

So the other day I read a book, and today-
there being no better subject in the air, if you dis-
count Hitler—I’m going to rave about it. If you
want to say, “This is where we came in,” my feel-
ings aren’t easily hurt.

The book is “The Importance of Living.” The
author is one Lin Yutang, Chinese philosopher-
humorist. That combination of titles may frighten
you away from reading the book; don’t let it. If
you like your wisdom in chocolate-coated pills, with
a tang of humour and a dash of cynicism, race
over to Carnegie Library and stand at the nice
lady’s elbow until she shoves “The Importance of
Living” into your hot little hand.

Achieving W’isdom

It is not, as the title might suggest, of the wake-
up-and-live variety. It will not tell you how to
win friends; it will not give formulas for inﬂuenc-
ing people; it will not help you to distinguish be-
tween Opportunity and the Wolf when you hear
something at the door.

The idea of the whole thing is that one should
lie under a tree—-in the manner of Ferdinand—and
invite one’s soul. Only by patience, quietness and
loaﬁng does one achieve wisdom. Without being
preachy or over-cynical, author Lin tells you just

You Learn Something

The book is dotted with such pungent aphorisms
as, Clear thoughts expressed in unclear language
denote the conﬁrmed bachelor. He doesn’t have to
explain things to a wife.” So you can tell what
it’s like. And he resurrects dry proverbs and old
stories and sticks them in like plums. Me, I like
plums.

Well, that should be enough. But one more thing.
You learn quite a bit about the Chinese tempera-
ment and habits as you read——doing it the painless
way, of course. Maybe you’d like to know some-
thing about China and its people. So many people
are talking about that place these days. Aren’t
they having a war over there, or something?

We don’t care either but the Purple Parrot,

until a two-page supplement of pictures showing

Wet C rop
John G. Crommelin, Alabama planter, sent ﬁve

Maybe it has something to do with a new pro-

Transfer Student
A grandson of Sun Yat—Sen, “Father of the Chi-
nese Republic,” has enrolled at the University of
California for the winter semester. He had been
studying political science at Shanghai until Japa-
nese bombs destroyed the institution.

I hope he has more success with the transfer
of his credits than Japan has had.

Coalition Course

Secretary of Interior Ickes, sounding off in Chi-
cago last week, complained that colleges do not
prepare students for social and political responsi-
bility. ‘ It was suggested that universities institute

‘a course in practical p.olitics.

It would be more effective to join a frater-
nity. il '

A.University of Iowa professor has devised an

the palm of the hand.

For The Very Young
By Milton G.

Dedicated to our incurable Friend Aubrey, who
looks at the Essence of Spring as a mechanistic
Accomplishment.
For months we’ve tried to educate our friend-—
(his name is Aubrey; Aubrey is his name)
but now, alas, we find we’ve reached the end
of our endurance. Listen to our claim:

This Aubrey, reader, is of stolid form;
he builds an absolute cosmography;
he seeks to analyze the summer storm;
he sees all Nature mechanistically.

Remember, we have tried to inculcate-

Or, better, to inspire our ingenue;

Glad-eyed we’ve coaxed him from his primal state:
“Oh, friend, see Nature’s thrilling subtlety!”

VVhen yesterday our friend saw spring, he boomed:
“Well I’ll be damned. The gol-darned buds are
bloomed.” '

ordinary session, called by Her Majesty, the Queen» Ant.

The Queen had not’ yet made her appearance.

She was, at

tween his mandibles, he began to‘v‘
blow furiously. The assembly be-
came hushed.

The Queen emerged, while the

Ion the throne, nodded gravely in
all directions. The delegates took
ltheir seats.

“My friends,” said the Queen,
“it is time now that you know the
situation in which we are in-
volved.” She said this quickly,
brusquely. The delegates looked
at each other.

SHRIEKS OF DISCORD

The Queen went on, “My friends,
for some time you have known of
the difficulties we have suffered at
the hands of the Robber Ants.
Trying to retain a policy of watch-
ful indiﬁerence, we have come to
a crisis. It is my belief that I
have done wisely and well in re-
moving from the circles of our 
government our Ministre d’Utopia. 1
I have accepted the resignation of f
Master Ant Adam!” ’

She paused for effect. The as-
sembly broke immediately into a
discord of shrieks. It was a shock.
A tremendous shock. VVhat, was it
that Adam, the idealist of the na-
tion, was to be thrust out? Not
Adam the popular, the handsome?
This was a shock.

OUT WITH IDEALISM

“Wait, my friends,” the Ant said,
“I know it is a shock to you, a
great shock. But you must under-
stand. The Minister has been dis-
missed-—that is true. But, friends,
this was done by me in considera-
tion of the means and methods of
obtaining peace.

“My friends,” cried the Queen,

“you must understand this. Ideal-

ists are well an.d good when the-

world runs well. But at a crises-1
and we are at one now—-a greater '
skill-——a practical skill-—is de-

manded rather than idealism.

SHOOT HIM DEAD

“The Robber Ants,” she intoned,
“must become our friends, wheth-
er or no we agree with them in
principle. They must be our
friends-—our very practical friends
——not our enemies-—our very hos-
tile and powerful enemies. I am
calling a special delegation, com-
posed of members of this body, to
meet with me this afternoon. We
shall discuss practical methods of
forming a clique with the Rob-
bers. In the meantime, my very
dear friends, you must bear with
me.”

The Queen bowed her head.
Slowly, deeply she proclaimed:
“And, friends, you must under-
stand that when we take the
Idealist, the Ministre d’Utopia,
the Master Ant Adam out into the
square tomorrow morning at sun-
up, and when we shoot him dead,
we do not do this thing against a
man, but against an Idealism in
a day when Idealism must not be
tolerated. This is a practical and
a very sorry world today,” the
Queen said. She bowed her head,
lowered her antennae, and mourn-
fully left, the catacombs. '

Minute
Interviews

By Messer off and Al-zselrad

Herbert Hockstetter, C41, took
a little convincing but proved to
be the ideal interview.

Before Herby, traveller, racon-
teur, Georgie Porgie, and nut on
philosophical nuances, turned his
serious profile toward us, we got a
glimpse of how far his sense of
humor can go. For censored
stories, see Herby.

During his travels this summer,
Herby was arrested in seven
States for being a crime Wave.
Herby claims the police were mis-
taken; they thought he looked like
the Dimpled Killer.

Herby has ambitions, his high-
est beingto learn to walk stilts.
Because his father is a noted sci-
entistwho ‘makes paper out of
straw, I-Ilerby, hopes some day to
turn the tables on him and make
straw out of paper.

Concerning metaphysical nuan-
ces, Herby says, “The trouble with
people is that most of them are
indifferent to the other person’s
moods and ways, if these moods
and ways differ from their own,
and so they term these people as
“crazy, too quiet, so reserved,
aloof, and whatnot” without tak-
ing time to try to understand
them.”

When we left Herby, he told us
to look him up some time, any
time, either in the Commons room,
or in Frankie’s Marine Bar, three

delegates stood erect, bowing their ,1 3
heads. The Queen took her place? ~\\

By LEONARD LEVISON
Confessioiis of a dissillusion-
ed reporter: Our earnest blast

against holding the Olynipicr

Olson Relents

Carl Olson, with one of
Olympic champions hiding away
under his wing, was a little more
encouraging. “I can’t see any rea-

* 3

son in boycotting the games, but an Old St01"Y '50 B111-

if you can convince me, I am
ready to be convinced.”

After thirty minutes of argu-
mentation, aided by Frank Car-
ver’s Olson-heckling and Ollie
Stiff’s silent approval, Olson
started to come around to our way
of thinking. “I’ll think it over,”
was his only bit of submission,
however. But, now there is hope.

It’s not exactly that Eddie

How effectively Jack Schrick-

“big” meet with Penn State will
go a long way in determining just
how successful the present box-
ing year can be called.

The Lions, usually among the
nation’s best, are in one of their
weaker moods. The Panthers, on
the contrary are more potent than
usual. On the basis of compara-
tive meets, Pitt is given a slight
edge. Syracuse beat State by

To Gain First

Win Over State
By JACK IVIITCIIELL

\Vhen the Pitt boxing team
enters the ring against the
weakened, but dangerous, Penn
State outﬁt tomorrow nite, it
will have to put up a better
two-ﬁstcd attack than it did
against Catholic U. last week.

The State boys have been
weakened considerably by gradu-
ation, and ineligibility. Lost by
graduation were Goodman, the 135
eastern and national champ,
Richter, the eastern heavyweight
champ, and Captain Ritzie, for-

Nestor
for the eastern

Kociubinsky, runner—upi
175—p.ound title I;

were declared ineligible by the‘

Strohl at 118 pounds and Doan*faculty committee, for participat—’

pounder will probably ﬁnd Strohl
too much for him, but it will be
Hoeveler has
had the misfortune to match holds
with some of the best men in the
country at his weight, and after
the scraps were over, his oppon-
ents were still the best men.

Captain Rudy Tomarelli of
Pitt, with three years more ex-
perience than Hoeveler, has a bet-
ter than even chance to stop Doan,
and tack a few points on the
Panther’s total.

According to Coach Mazeski, it
would be too much to expect
Manny Ardalino to win over
State’s Graven in the 135 pound
class. The Kent wrestler is one
of the big reasons for his team’s
impressive victory run, having
beaten all opponents with little
trouble.

HEAVIES FEATURED

State is weak in the 155-pound
division, and Mazeski is looking
for Whitey Kosinski, a boy whol
has had more than his share of
bad luck, to break his slump, and
win.

The top match of the evening
will come when the big boys get,
together. Heavyweight Frank'
Kristufek of Pitt meets State’s
Falcone.

Larry Roofner’s mid-year exam
difficulties have kept Mazeski busy
trying to ﬁnd a 145-pounder.
Sandy McLeod, showing well in
defeat against Temple, is Mazes-
ki’s present choice.

Pitt Gets One More Title
Chance, Must Beat Tech

By KAL KALWARY
It ’s the City Championship for Pitt tomorrow evening or a
three-way tie, when they clash with Carnegie Tech, in the

Schenley Park court.

VVednesday night‘ it seemed like old times at the Stadium,
when Duquesne and Pitt staged a tight scrimmage, with a dra-
matic close, for which the two clubs are famous.

The two

mentors were on their feet in the¢

ﬁnal moments, Duquesne’s Chick
Davies bawling at the officials,
and Pitt’s Dr. Carlson shoving
scrubs into the game, in order to
kill time, and causing general dis-
order at the time table. The Bluff-
men came out ahead, 39-37.

TRIPLE TIE LOOMS

The Blue and Gold dribblers
must defeat Maxie Hannum’s
Skibos, Saturday night, if they
are to retain the City cup. If the
Pitts continue their desperate
play, relying on their beef and
height to tally points, Coach Carl-
son's boys are going to have a
difficult time keeping pace with
the speedy Tartans, and, conse-
quently, be wedged into a triple
play-off.

On the offense, the Hilltoppers
were a ﬁve—man miniature of
Samuel Goldwyn’s “I-Eu1',ric'ane,”
but on the defense they looked,
like an, luntutored pick-up team,
nevertheless, the Davies men were
scrappy enough to check the crude
Panther drives. Only their size
and accurate foul shooting kept
the Jungle Cats in the ball game.

DUKES LEAD AT HALF

Duquesne held a four point ad-
vantage at the halftime,‘ 20 to 16.
The second half started off with
racey passing that was never once
slackened. Duke relinquished
their intermission lead of 4 points,
to 2 marks, twice, then Pitt’s Rad-
vansky tied the ball game up, at
30 all.

Captain Johnson, Spotovich and
Garcia brought the Panthers"
within one point of the Dukes.
The scoreboard read, Duquesne

38, Pitt 37, and the 2,500 specta-

tors went into a sub-panic, as a
jump-ball was called near the
Bluff goal, with but one and a
half minutes left to play.

DUQUESNE WINS

The gun cracked through the
hub-bub seconds later. Duquesne
had evened their season’s series
with the Panthers, and won a
well-earned victory. Duquesne’s
“Pickles” Kreiling came off with
the scoring honors, six ﬁeld goals
and one charity toss, for a total
of 13 marks. Pitt’s Captain Bob
Johnson was only one point be-
hind the tiny Bluffman, with 12.

Skibo Gym houses the ﬁnal
intra-city floor tilt, Sabbath,
night, with Tech and Pitt decid-
ing the City crown question.
Coach Hannum’s outfit, although
they badly bungled a healthy
lead, and bowed to Georgetown
the eveningof the Pitt—Duke bat-
tle, are going to be tough cus-
tomers for the Panthers to wan-
gle points from.

TECH TOMORROW

Tech opened the 1937-38 cam-
paign with little more than the
Bluffites, but displayed remark-
able form in the early games, then
fell down,‘ and now the Scotch-
men are looking like their earlier
selves. Veterans Captain Bill
Miller and "‘B‘uzzy” \Greenberg,,
along with sophomore “Babe”
Stark, are the Tartan’s main guns.
Stopping these clever courtmen
is an assignment that looks doub-
ly stiff since the Blue and Gold’s
dismal showing Wednesday.

Also, not to be dealt with light-
ly, are the go-getting tactics of

ing in amateur bouts this summer.
- Alex Sopchak, a promising var-
sity l55—pounder of the past sea-
son has given up boxing due to the
fact that he cannot make the
weight.

Captain Sammy Donato and Al-
len Tapman are the only hold-
overs from last year’s team. Do-
nato, co-captain of last season’s
football team, has had a brilliant
ring record at State. He ﬁghts in
both the 145 and l55—pound class-
es and has lost only one collegiate
bout in three years. He is sched-
uled to meet John Neuner, Pitt’s
155 substitute.

WARGO ON TAP

Tapman, a junior, fought his
way to the ﬁnals againstesorenson
of Syracuse last year. He is a
rugged two—ﬁsted slugger. John-
nie Wargo, Pitt’s most consistent
winner will face him.

Penn State’s 1l5—pounder, Ken
Byrd, novice who never boxed
previous to this season and has
held his own up to date, is to meet
Ralph Dorand, the present eastern
conference champ.

The Panther Captain, Ralph
Caruso, will face Roy Hanna, an-
other ﬁrst—year varsity man.
Hanna has won two bouts so far.

Frank Silvestri and Jed Cur_zi
will swing ﬁsts in 145 division.
Silvestri, as a member of the
freshman team last year was eas-
ily defeated by Curzi.

BOMBER AGAINST BOMBE

Another Novice, Heber Lessig,
who, although a senior who never
boxed outside of intramural com-
petition until this season, has
knocked out both opponents he
has faced, and will meet Ray
Bombe.

Paul Ashmann, the Pitt 175-
pounder, will swing it out with
Alfred Bolder. Bolder was on the
Lion’s freshman team two years
ago.

Lupey Luppinnacci, formerly a
l75—pounder, vwill be ﬁghting in
the heavy division against Nate
Handler or Dave Nemeth. Coach
Schricker moved Lupey up be-
cause of a shortage in the heavy
class.

BASKETBALL

Round-robin play in the Intra-

supplanted by a double elimina-

to secure the Stadium floor.

Each team is assured of playing
two games with the winners ad-
vancing toward the ﬁnals until
they have been defeated by a su-
perior foe.

Twenty-one teams, the largest
number to ever participate in in-
tramural athletics, are entered in
the tournament. They are of the
Tau Alpha Rho, Ubangi, and Med-
icals, who have already advanced
to the second round with wins
over Legal Softies, Miners, and
Freshmen Chem. Engineers re-
spectively. Besides those already
mentioned are Chemical Engi-

Stowies, Continental Fireworks,
Delta Sigma Delta, Pitt Riﬂes,
Junior Metallergists, Industrial

Lomas Announces
Debate Statistics

Forensic Coach °
Prepares Survey

Of Teams’ Work

By RUGY ALDISERT

Twenty-six members of Men ’s
Debating Association partici-
pated in 65 contests before an
aggregate audience of 11,840
during the first half of the
1937-38 debate season.

So declared Charles W.
Lomas, instructor in speech and
director of men’s debating, who
has just completed a mid-year
summary of the association’s ac-
tivities.

Varsity teams have seen action
in 4- meets, the report reads, while
freshman representatives have had
22 debates with neighboring high
schools and colleges.

ARGUE THREE SUBJECTS

Members have discussed three
major questions, most employed
being the national intercollegiate
topic, “Resolved; That the Nation-
al Labor Relations Board should
be empowered to enforce arbitra-
tion in all industrial disputes.”

Also included were the national
high school question, “Resolved:
That the several states should
adopt an unicameral system of
legislation,” and “Resolved: That
collective bargaining in American

industries should be conducted
through non-company industrial
unions.”

The largest audience to witness
a contest was at the West high
school in Cleveland, where 1300
students watched the University’s

Students In Music A pprcciution
Study Well-Known C om positions

“Put Beethoven’s Fifth on the?

skillet for me,” is a typical phrase
heard on the twenty-third floor,
headquarters of the music appre-
ciation course taught by Theodore
M. Finney, director of men’s mu-
sical activities.

Unusual in presentation, in
method of studying, and in tests,
this course symbolizes advance-
ments made in the ﬁeld of educa-
tion today.

The 150 University students
who take the course go through
an interesting procedure in-their
years work. Instead of listening
to lectures they listen to record-
ings of classics played on an elec-
tric phonograph.

Their home—work, if it can be
called such, consists of replaying
recordings heard in class; there
are several listening rooms for the
students’ use.

In class students learn the ma-
jor works of the more famous
classical composers. In addition,l
the students study biographies

y

,course play in

and styles of writing music.

Students must suppress their
“swing” inclinations while they are
in class, for Benny Goodman has
never desecrated their ears. Be-
ing the more ardent of the Uni-
versity’s concert fans, the stu-
dents listen to the swing of string
quartets, opera albums, and sym-
phonies.

Advance notice of a test is giv-
en one week ahead of time. Mr.
Finney tells the students the mu-
sic they should be able to iden-
tify.

The week preceding the test, the
listening-rooms are crowded with
students, who are preparing their
“home-work.” For the tests Mr.
Finney plays passages from vari-
ous compositions, which the stu-
dents must identify.

Many of the students taking the
the 5 University
band or orchestra; they agree that
the course is one of the best-liked
courses at the University.

ern Association of College Busi-
; ness Oﬁicers, the Eastern Associa-
Etion, and the Southern Associa-
 tion.

i In 1930, at the suggestion of the
lfederal ofﬁce of education, the
fthree associations appointed rep-
jresentatives who met and dis-
cussed the problems of ﬁnancial
reports for universities. The out-
growth of this meeting was a book
published in 1935, with money
provided by the General Educa-
tion Board, entitled “Financial
Repoits for College and Universi-
ties.”

The recommendations set forth
in this book have been adopted
generally by universities all over
the United States, and several
state legislatures have declared by
law that their universities must
use the ﬁnancial reporting plan
as outlined by the book.

Women Debate
F enn College

arrive at the University next
Monday to debate with a Univer-
sity team on the question: “Should
the National Labor Relations
Board be empowered to enforce
arbitration in all industrial dis-
putes?” The contest will be held
in 132 Cathedral at 12:30 o’clock.

Representing the University
will be Florence Hiller, C38, vice
president of the Women’s debating
team, and Jeanette Swartz, C38.
Miss Hiller and Miss Swartz will
defend the negative side of the
question. The debate will be open
to students and faculty members.

Sigma C hi’ 3
Attend Convention

Six men from the local Sigma
Chi chapter were caught up in a
whirl of skating, skiing, tobog-
ganing parties and old fashioned
sleigh rides last week-endat the
Western Pennsylvania-West Vir-
ginia Conference which met at
Penn State.

George Hoover, Caesar Aidi-
sert, Harry Howard, Clifford
Allen, Robert Heape, and Andy
Cancilicrre were the lucky dele-
gates.

Dr. John G. Bowman was hon-
ored by his fraternity brothers
in the latest issue of theirina-

zine of Sigma Chi.” Written by
Robert X. Graham, the article
cited the many achievements of
the Chancellor and emphasized

Ruth Belle Strothcrs
Married Wednesday

Congratulations to a former Pitt
Newsite, and incidentally, one of
our predecessors! Ruth Belle
Strothers, who edited just such a
column as this along about two
years ago, became the bride of
Robert Ferron last Wednesday at
St. Andrew’s Protestant Episcopal
Church.

Ruth Belle was attended by two
of her fraternity sisters, Ruth
Jones and Ruth, Ferron. Follow-
ing the wedding ceremony, which
all the Beta Sigs turned out to see,
a reception and dinner were held
at the Penn Lincoln Hotel in Wil-
kinsburg. .

National Officer
Visits Phi Mu’s

Mrs. Reed, the Phi Mu nation-
al rushing chairman, visited the
local group last week to offer
suggestions in anticipation for
a big ﬁrst week-end in March.
It’s rushing for the ladies then!

Among the oddities in a col-
lection of Indian pottery owned
by the Phi Mu’s patronesses, Dr.
and Mrs. Engelder, is a turtle
which turns out to be a water
jar. At least, that’s what the
girls found out when they dined
at the home of the Enfelders on
Monday night.

Omission Of Names

Just to let you know that our
