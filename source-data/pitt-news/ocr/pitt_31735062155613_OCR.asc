Pitt Only, College

To A Sanction Disputed
Iially Damage Pact

By» IRV ROTHMAN

The “rally” damage pact” originally drawnrup by “the.
representatives of all «the city colleges, has received the ap-
proval of only the Pitt Student Congress thus far.

The proclamation written at Carnegie Institute» of Tech-
nology, Oct. 1, stated that each school’s student government
group will “assume ﬁnancial responsibility for any damages

 

I stated, concerning the pact,

done,” by students from those in-9'

stitutions. 1n the event that any
student is caught fnﬂicting dam-
ages he would “bear the expense”
it continued.

Original Revised

Though official word has not
been received _from Tech, PCW,
nor Duquesne, it is understood
that'Tech has revised the original
statement. The revision places re-
sponsibility only upon guilty par-
ties, if they can be apprehended.

Ross Reese, SC president, has
(KI
think it's still in effect here be-
cause it involved an understand-
ing with the University. As a
statement of policy we can’t go
back orrit.” He stressed the point
that there are others involved
besides the three colleges.

At last Monday’s meeting, coun-
cil members brought out the fact
that Tech’s SC had not approved
the original pact; that Duquesne’s
student government had not yet
been organized to meet the situa-
tion; and that PCW has not yet
replied. Representatives at the
original meeting did not have the
authority to pass on the agree-
ment, ﬁnal approval resting with
their groups.

‘Statement 01‘ Intentions

“If nothing else,” Reese main-
tained, “it-is a statement of inten-
tions.” He mentioned that when
the ‘ other schools agree to the
statement it will become a pact,
but until then it remains an un-
derstanding between the Pitt stu-
dent body and the University ad-
ministration. - '

“If” Over H ere

‘Big Rally’ Over

Here-.-and a Big

For the third straight week,‘
Student Congress Assemblies I
Committee typed up a little
request to the University
Deans to obtain permission for
a Monday morning victory ral-
ly if Pitt should win the pre-
vious Saturday. Notre Dame
and Northwestern refused to
furnish a reason for a celebra-
tion and the rallies never came
off, '

Undaunted, the committee
has scheduled another rally
for Monday, third hour, if Pitt
beats Minnesota, and classes
will be excused in the under-
graduate schools and freshman
and sophomore years in the
Schoolof Pharmacy. ‘

The Post-Gazette found one
of these notices last week and
pasted it to the wall of the
editorial room with the biting
comment: “This is spontane-
ous enthusiasm?”

Shaw ‘at his satirical best. This

Shaw uses this plot as a means of
stating his views on religion and
humanity.

In the lead role of Androcles,
Harvey Kelly is perfect. He plays
his role to thehilt and is sure to

The size of the cerebrum has
little to do with academic success
if a student lacks motivation and
plain hard work, according to a
news release from Dr. W. Clarke
of Xavier University.

Not only can less intelligent
student succeed through hard
work, but gifted people endowed
with high IQ. can’t get ‘by on
‘the fact that tests show they have
intelligence.

In a paper Dr. Clarke publish-

that reading speed is not as im-

Two Perfect Records at Stake
As Olsonmen Host Mounties

By PAUL HARRISON

Two unbeaten h a r r i e r
squads, West Virginia and
Pitt, renew their annual rival-
ry tomorrow morning on the
Schenley Park turf.

Both teams have succeeded
in coppirig their ﬁrst six en-
gagements
paign. The locals, however, own
a streak of seven in a.row by vir-
ture of a-victory over Ohio State
in their last contest in 1952.

Although the Mountaineers have
run roughshod over Southern Con-
ference opponents, the Olsonmen
hold the edge due, to the strong-
er caliber of teams they have met
and conquered this season. An-
other point in the Panthers’ favor
is running on their‘home course
where they have dropped but one
of 17 meets over a stretch of ﬁve
years. ‘

In the clash of the unbeaten,
Coach Carl Olson will stick to the
same lineup that has outclassed its
opponents by use of the blanket

may see action tonight after re-
cuperating from an emergency ap-
pendectomy. Tom Kovalenko, still
nursing _an injured ligament, -and
Nick Passodelis, injured in the
State game, will be sidelined un-
til next week. ‘
Hot Competition

Petro pointed out that, “al—
though all the positions on the
squad are bitterly contested, the
hottest competition is among the
backs.” Joe Walton and Ralph
Cipers are ﬁghting to nail down
the fullback spot, with Joe Mazur,
whofaccording to Petro, “improv-
ed considerably on defense during
the week,” in the role of the dark-
horse. _

Jim Lenhart and Cornelius Sal-
vaterra have deﬁnite ambitions
concerning the "signal-caller’s
post, along with Darrell Lewis, an
excellent southpaw passer, who
also ranks high as a righthalf be-
cause of his ‘left-handed tossing
ability. Tom Jenkins, Chuck Cost,
Ed Paul, and Gene Pawlikowski
also have their eyes on the right
half spot. ‘ ' .4

Line Shortage

“Bugs”
Woitkovich have thrown their hel-
mets into the ring for the left half
position.

A shortage of linemen narrows
down Petro’s selection for a start-
ing forward wall. Nevertheless,
Petro claimed, “I wouldvhesitate
to choose a starting line, for I
know I won’t do an honest job.”

Observers feel that Petro will
not have such a diﬁicult time chos-
ing his starting lineup
night’s game.

    Only $4.50?

Vvalking away from the ruins
of his ﬂying saucer, the tiny
' creature opened his emergency
kit. Peering into it with his

middle eye, hebeheld a stack of
greenbacks, packs of chewing gum, and a sheet of instructions
which read: “In this kit you will ﬁnd everything you‘ need
to live as a college student. All college men wear clothes and
chew gum. Buy clothes, chew gum constantly. . . and good

luck!"

Scratching his left antenna with his lower left hand, he
tore off half of a ﬁve dollar bill, popped it into his mouth,
and scuttled into a nearby college shop. “Let’s see your ﬁncst

shirt," he squeaked.

The trembling clerk handed him a Van Heusen Oxfordian.
“Gleeps, that's really_.a rnimsyl", screeched the little fellow,
feeling the luxurious Oxford fabric. “How much is it?"

“Only $4.50," quavered the clerk. "I have them in the
smartest new colors. ..and white to boot. Plus roll collars,
button-downs and new short collars." » ’

"Only $4.50? Fantasticl”, piped the creature. “l’ll take

one of eachl”

Carefully he counted out twenty sticks of gum and laid
them on the counter. “Keep tlfé change,” he chortled, put-
ting the shirts under his middle arm. And munching mer-
rily on a crisp ten dollar bill, he waddled out.
