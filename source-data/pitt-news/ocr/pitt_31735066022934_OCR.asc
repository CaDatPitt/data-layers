Perella anclBecker Victors in IFC and Pan Hel Elections

By TERESA SOKOL 2

The Inter Fraternity Council and-
g the Pan Hellenic Association
" «announced the results of the recent—

elections of their respective pres-
idents and executive boards.

IFC and Pan Hel are responsible
for unifying and directing the

activities of their Greek associa-

tions. .

IFC noted that over ‘ten percent
of the undergraduate population is
comprised of Greeks.

Jackie Becker of Alpha Delta Pi
Sorority is the new president of the
Pan Hellenic - association for the
upcoming "year and Don Perella of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon is president

of the IFC.

Becker. who said she is happy
about being elected. explained the
voting process that determines the
Pan Hellenic Executive Board.

“When the final slate of
candidates is decided. each of the
candidates goes before the twelve
voting sororities to speak,” she

said. Becker added that each sister
: t

then has one vote for each position
open in the election.

Becker said that her tentative
plans as president includes some
changes in the rush system and

getting pledges more involved in.

Twenty more days until
Christmas...a week until ﬁnals...
and six more days until Lothrop
Hall’s Christmas dinner.

Maybe that last reminder
doesn't mean much to most ‘Pitt
students, but it’s important to the
participants in the’ first annual
Lothrop Challenge.

The Lothrop V Challenge was
issued almost three weeks ago by
the Lothrop Hall Council as a way
to “get into the Christmas spirit,”
according to Joel Sansone, creator
of the event. The residence_ halls

on campus, have been challenged to '
. raise more money for their favorite

charity than Lothrop Hall does: by
the evening of Christmas dinner,
Dec‘. 11.

‘At least three dorms+—Tower ~C-.'

\

McCormick and Brackenridge—
have accepted the challenge,
according to Lorelei Kelley, vice
president of the Lothrop Hall
Council. ‘
“Breckenridge is making food

baskets to give to the needy,” said‘

Kelley. “And McCormick Hall is
raising money for children who
have cleft palates.”

-Lothrop Hall’s big fund-raising

event will be a benefit Christmas
show the evening of Christmas

. dinner in «Lothrop _ Cafeteria.

Sansone said a similar musical
show last year gave him the "idea
for the Lothrop Challenge.

“Last December, Jim Gallagher,
the cafeteria manager at Lothrop,
heard that a group of us students

had gone to Presbyterian Hospital *

to sing Christmas carols,” Sansone
said,_ “He invited our group to sing
at the cafeteria’s Christmas dinner.

“We came to‘ the dinner, sang
carols, and set out a few decorated
coffee cans for people to donate
money -for Children’s Hospital,”
‘added Sansone. The group raised

1 $100.

Earlier this year, Sansone
suggested a Christmas charity
appeal be started in all the dorms.‘
The Lothrop‘ Hall Council, along
with the Resident Student Assoc-
iation, the Office of Residence Life
and «Gallagher, came up with the
Lothrop Challenge.

‘Lothrop Hall is aiming to raise at
least $500 for Children’s Hospital,‘
according to Sansone. In addition
to the Christmas show, the ‘-hall is

holding a breakfast-in-bed raffle
and’ a pie-throwingpcontest (spon-
sored by’ the resident assistants).

Many Lothrop students have also
signed a huge Christmas card_ for
Children’s Hospital. the card,
which is more like a giant sign, is
now hanging outside the dorm
facing Children’s Hospital.

Sansone hopes that the Lothrop
Challenge becomes a tradition at
Pitt.

‘‘I’m in my ﬁfth undergraduate
year‘ at Pitt, and I've seen a lot of
bad press about students,” said
Sansone. “This is one way to show

that students do really care about

others?’ — -

The Student Government Board

allocations committee last night-

released its official list of officially
recognized and partiallyrecognized
student organizations. '
According to Kerry‘ Warren,
coordinator of the Allocations
Committee the difference between
a fully recognized organization and

a partially recognized organization I I

lies inthe fact that the prior can
utilize university facilities, use the

university’s name. rent films. and .

request an unlimited amount of

money from the allocations com- -

mittee. while the latter is limited to
$100 requests, with no allowances
for programming costs. . '
_Student Government president
Stan Galanski questioned the

reasoning behind placing Greek ,-

Week on the list of fully recognized
organizations. when both the

Interfraternity Council. and. the"
Panhellenic Association are gov-_

ernance groups which receive
different budgetary priority.
Warren said the committee

believed the process of dividing up ,

the expenses of the festivities
between the-two groups could be
alleviated by making
recognized student organization. —

In the end, the board passed the

entire recognition proéess with the v ‘

stipulation that the Greek Week

listing be made separately .at the  ' , 

end of the document.

Warren also asked for the

approval of two dates that ‘will
begin the initial allocations process
for the coming year—Jan. 21, for a

meeting of organizational business’ .

managers where initial information
will be distributed to the ‘organiza-

tions concerning allocations, and»,

Pitt Hotline Staff Finds

By DEBBIE MARTIN

Pitt News Staff Writer
There is probably, more depres-

" . .
ston among students during ﬁnals

than at any other time of the year,
according to Marisette van Linden
of the Pitt Hotline staff.

Though the end of the term is a
busy time for the Pitt Hotline, there
is still hope and help for victims of
the end-term slump, said van
Linden, who coordinates the Pitt
Hotline along with Tim Bunner.

“Our organization is made up of
people who ‘really care, who really
want to help,” she said.

V A sophomore psychology major.)
van Linden stressed ~ that the
hotline offers a conﬁdential “peer-
to-peer” counseling service for
even the smallest of problems.

“We’re paraprofessionals,” she
explained. “We don’t impose our
own values; we just try to put the
problem in perspective.”

Each of the 25 members went

through a program that trained

them to handle “crisis situations”
before they could answer the
hotline.
role-playing and learning about
various techniques dealing with
drug-, sex- and university-related
problems, van Linden said.
Information on where students can
go for additional help is also
taught,__she_ added.

After this training, members
were Screenﬁd by coordinators and
Mike Gigler. a doctoral intern at
the university counseling center.

According to van Linden, the
group started in 1971 as “A Little
‘Help From Your Friends.” At the
time the main goal was helping
students with drug-related prob
lems. The‘ organization has
changed its name to the Pitt
Hotline this year and now handle a
variety of calls.

“Once in a while, we get 'a
suicide call, or one from someone
who needs more help than we can
give them,” van Linden said,
adding that these calls are referred
to pgofessionals. ‘.‘Some calls are
pretty bizarre, but mostly we deal
with boyfriend/girlfriend prob-
lems.”

The hotline’s.number is 624-5966

e E A Bad 'l'iming
A For Kennedy

Senator Edward M. Kennedy has been forced to do
a quick doubletake to answer critics of his untimely
comments about the deposed Shah of Iran and the
former Iranian monarch’s reign. Both Republican-
and Democratic leaders chided ‘Kennedy for
statements, which implicitly challenged President
Jimmy Carter's decision to admit the shah to the
United States. Kennedy called the shah’s rule “one
of the most violent regimes in the history of
mankind.” . . ~

Kennedy responded to the criticism by saying he
supported the President’s efforts to free the hostages
in Tehran and by condemning the Ayatollah
Khomeini for violating international law by
permitting the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Iran. .

The Massachusetts senator’s effortto qualify his
earlier statements only partly atones for the serious
blunder he made when he chose such apoor time to
make his comments. Such words from the major

. challenger to Carter for the Democratic presidential

nomination encourages the radical elements of the
Khomeini government, who believe they can bring
the United States_to its knees with the continued
holding’ of the hostages. Although Kennedy’s
feelings about the former Iranian ruler have some
merit, his decision to make critical statements about
the shah now is irresponsible. One Carter
administration official pointed out the impact of the
Kennedy statements, commenting: “_If they
(Iranians) _think they are getting somewhere (with
their criticism of the shah) they’ll, hold onto the
hostages that much longer.”

What is most surprising is that a supposedly

politically astute man like Kennedy decided to make
such comments while American hostages still are
being held in Tehran. During the crisis, Republican
\and Deomocratic presidential candidates, members
of congress and the American public have given their
full - support to Carter, emphasizing that the
paramount concern of the United States must be an

4 end to the holding of the hostages. Even the forever

irreverent Johnny Carson has refrained from making

' any comment about the hostages.

The anti—shah statements made by Kennedy despite

, the united support for Carter on the Iran crisis has t5‘

be seen as either brazen opportunism or grave
miscalculation by,.the senator. Whichever of these

j two reasons was the cause for Kennedy’s comments,

a serious question is raised about his judgment. Any
man who would gamble with the lives of 50
Americans -for his political gain,‘ or who doesn’t
'-"consider the impact of his comments on those 50
Americans, is not too promising a leader. Even

‘ Kennedy was forced to admit his mistake and said it

was “neither- useful or wise” to discuss the shah’s
human rights record at this time.

There are serious questions about Carter's decision

to admit the shah when he knew that Iranianrea-ction.

would be severe. Other concerns,,such as the shah’s
use of torture against political enemies, can be
considered only after the American hostages are
released. Congressional hearings can be expected

”‘after the end of the present crisis, and until such

hearings are held it would be best if Kennedy and
other presidential candidates refrain from comment.

Abandonment of Grading Sys’rem—Punishmem‘ For-The Good

Since you so often print letters.
front members of the Anti-
lmperialist Student Union. I
thought it was about time someone
offered a rebuttal to one of them.

in reference to John Hess‘ letter
in your November 30th edition. I
agree ntost emphatically that ntost
exams given at Pitt do not
encourage creative. independent
thought. That is where my
agreement with Mr, Hess begins
and ends.

He objects to the grading system
as a process of weeding out the
good front the bad. If the grading
system is abandoned. what stand-
ard will there be? He offers no
alternative. I get the impression
that he feels that there should be
no standard at all. that everyone
who starts at the University shou'ld
automatically be granted a degree
120 credits, later. and that all
degrees should be equal.

Wouldn't that punish the good
—— the intelligent. the hard
working. the ambitious — and
benefit only the -lazy and incont-
petent? lfanyone can get a degree.
then the graduates degree is of no

value to the outside world. What
conclusions are-to,b,e drawn about a
system that would not reward a
person for working hard. for using
his intelligence? lt doesn’t take
ntuch to imagine what kinds of
people will be drawn to such a
system. Are we to leave Pitt to only
the stupidest and laziest?
Perhaps the professors at Pitt

need to revise their standard of’

grading to better reflect true

ability. but the complete abandon-’ .

ntent of all standards is certainly
not the answer. '

As for the University discrimin-
ating against those students who
have to work. and those who don't
conte front wealth high schools:
HORSE FEATHERS!!!

l ant presently working 14 hours
a week in addition to carrying 15
credits. I ant a graduate of the
Pittsburgh Public Schools. a school
system hardly noted for its wealth.
Perhaps because of these things. I
did start at a disadvantage. ls it
fair‘? Maybe not. is it anyone's
responsibility to see that l graduate
front Pitt anyway? Yes: nti_nc and
ntine alone. I ant proud of the

/ .

responsibility of getting what I
want on my own. and resent Mr.
Hess’ intplication that people like
me can't get through college and
into a good job without sonteone‘s

~ help. As for being weeded out. my

QPA is 3.6. _
Finally. grades are NOT’ all
prospective entployers look at when

considering graduating seniors. lt
is well known to each andlevery one
of us that employers consider
prior work experience ‘at least as
ntuch as grades. So. it would seem
that those of us who are working

* while in school are at an advantage.

not a disadvantage as Mr. Hess
claims.

If we are “not receiving the"

education we pay for." as Mr. Hess

contends. we ntust take ntost of the
reponsibility ourselves. instead of
whining about how unfair the
system is. S

issue is whether Americans have

Eastern Eight Forecast: ‘Cats Wild

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
This, the fourth Eastern Eight
basketball season. should be the
most competitive in league history.
Only Villanova, last year’s regular
season champ, appears to be a
logical choice to win the league.
And Massachusetts, Pitt's op-

ponent Saturday night,‘ is a solid

favorite to ﬁnish in last place.
You can throw a blanket over the
second- through seventh-place

to win the Eastern Eight in its ﬁrst
go ‘round. The Bonnies' play
Villanova tonight. Forwards Earl
Belcher and Delmar Harrod com-
bined to score 40 points a game last
season, while guard Jim Elenz is
back in the quarterback role.
Because this is the team's ﬁrst year’
in the league. games outside the
league with Ohio, Providence. St.
Francis, Fairﬁeld. Detroit and Old
Dominion will count in the league
standings. St. Bonaventure plays at

guards and willsee more action as
the season progresses. Freshman
Paul Brozovich could be a sleeper.
one who should be able to spell
Clancy and Scheuermann up front.

WEST VIRGINIA - The Moun-
taineers are my darkhorse choice to
surprise a lot of teams this season.
Coach Gale Catlett. a Johnny
Majors-type who knows what needs
to be done to win in college
athletics, has those zany West
Virginians believing the Moun-

finishers, but for the sake of taineers can return to the days of
Wm ‘ _ j v Jerry West and’Hot Rod Hundley.
  , _ ’ I . The key ﬁgure in WVU’s ‘plans is
   ' I Lowes Moore, a 6-1 senior guard
with remarkable offensive skills.
Joe Fryz is the other guard, while
two very talented recruits, Greg
Jones and Diego McCoy, solidify
the guard slot for years to come.
Phil Collins, a 6-9 junior transfer
from Dodge City, Kansas. will start
at center. His back-up is Aliquip-
pa’s 6-8 Donnie Gipson, who gave
Sam Clancy some trouble during
their high school days. Starting
forwards Greg Nance and Dennis
Hosey also return. The Moun-
taineers have 15 quality scholar-
‘ ship players on their roster, with
players from eight different states
and one from the Bahamas‘.

' prediction, here’s a preview of this

teams appearing in my predicted

regular season only sets the stage

for the post-season tournament,
where the top four teams in the
league gain the home court
advantage in the first-round
games. From there, winners
advance to the Civic Arena for the
semiﬁnals and championship game
Feb. 29 and March 1.

' VILLANOVA - The Wildcats
return ﬁve starters from last year’s
regular season champion. Pitt beat
Villanova in the EAA Tournament,
77-64. Returning forward, 6-6 Alex
Bradley, is a Sam Clancy-type

--player who was an All-League

selection last year, and the

tournament MVP two years ago...
Aaron Howard, a 6-7 sophomore.

will start at the other forward

position. If the Wildcats have a‘
weakness, it could be at center,

where Marty‘ .Caron '(6-10, 225

pounds) is painfully slow. Fresh-

man John Pinone could push

Caron. The backcourt is set with

hot-shooting Tom Sienkiewicz and

Rory Sparrow. Depth could be a

problem if injuries or foul problems

strike. Coach Rollie Massimino has

been named Eastern Eight Coach

of the year each of the past two

seasons.

ST. BONAVENTURE - The Bon-
nies were added to the Eastern
Eight last spring after Penn State
and Dick Harter defected to

4 independence. Coach Jim Satilin’s

team has gone to either the NCAA

‘ or NIT tournaments each of the

past threeyears, and will be trying

erhaps the league’s most

  

DUQUESNE - ii the Dukes can
get away from the individualism
that has hurt their cause in recent
years, then big things could
happen on the Bluff. Coach Mike
Rice returns everybody of signiﬁ-
cance from last year’s disappoint-
ing 13-13 squad. BB Flenory is a
new man these‘days, having vowed

to become more of a playmaker- ’

assist man than the proliﬁc scorer
of years gone by. The Dukes

'-suffered a big loss when John

Moore has to take a redshirt for a
knee injury, but Bruce Atkins,
Doug Arnold, Fred Moon and
7-feet, 230-pound freshman (huge
but slow) Ricky Tunstall give
Duquesne good size and depth up
front. Jeff Baldwin is a candidate to
be the scoring guard, and if
Duquesne can go incident—free, it
could challenge for league honors,
especially with the tournament on
their home court.

PITT - The Panthers last year’s
Cinderella team, caught ﬁre at
mid-season and almost won the
league tournament, falling to
Rutgers, 61-S7 before 16,009 at the
Arena. With Sam Clancy. Sammie
Ellis and Carlton Neverson back,
Pitt has a ﬁne nucleus. If Ed
Scheuermann is able to overcome

~ the injury bug and be a factor, Pitt

could be that much better. With
Scheuermann, Clancy can pull
opposing big men away from the
"hoop, and open the lanes for Ellis
and Scheuermann. Dave Olinger is
probably the Panthers’ best shoot-
er while Lennie McMillian is a key
addition because of his versatility.
Sophomore Dwayne Wallace ap-
pears the best of the true point

employed by the Seattle Super-
sonics. Also gone is four—year
starter Abdel Anderson, so Young
has a rebuilding year of sorts.
Kelvin Troy and Daryl Strickland
are the best of the returnees, while
Young will look to six freshman
recruits for more immediate help.
The Knights might not win the
title, but they’ll still make life
miserable for all their opponents.

GEORGE WASHINGTON - The
Colonials are an enigma. When
they’re good, they can be almost
unbeatable, but when they’re bad,
they’re awful. The league’s best
center, 6-10 Mike Zagardo, is back
for one last shot at the Eastern

Tom Glenn. One of basketball’s
great pure shooters, Brian Magid,
is back for his last season, and if he
can improve his defense and
ball-handling skills, he could bean

tan David Thornton could challenge
for playing time as the season goes
on. The Pitt-GW series is growing
in interest, with Pitt having
knocked the Colonials out of the
Eastern Eight tournament in the
ﬁrst round each of the last two
seasons.

   Pitt Matmen Plaoe Sixth at Penn State Invitational

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The 1979-80 Panther wrestling
squad opened its season last week
with a sixth-place finish at the Penn
State Invitational. Under new head
coach Rande Stottlemeyer, Pitt
ﬁnished only two and one-half
points out of the ﬁfth position in the
tournament, which ﬁelded eight
teams, Eastern powerhouse Clari-
on State took top honors.

Individually, the Panthers had

";"'five wrestlers .place in the

invitational. Once again junior

honors; he placed second in the
118-pound weight class. Senior
Jackie Kline also captured second
place in the 126 class.

. After a year of redshirting, Mike
Bond returned to action. Bond, who
now has sophomore eligibility,
placed third in the 150-pound
category. Rounding out individual
places were fourth-place ﬁnishers
Tom Jones, at 158, and newcomer
Kelly Korth, at 167.

According to Stottlemeyer, the
Panthers will face one of their
toughest f'seasons in many years

Oklahoma. Oklahoma is considered
to be in the Big Four of wrestling in
the nation.

“We are deﬁnitely wrestling
against a star-studded schedule
this season,” said Stottlemeyer.
“We meet teams like Lehigh, who
placed third in the nation last year.
Teams who are always tough to

compete against will be Ohio State, .

Navy, Clarion and Penn State, to
name a few.”

TheoPanther squad will have a
mixture of old and young players
with various amounts of experience

weight class, a combination of
determination and experience
brings hope for a successful year.

“Although each weight class
does not have a great deal of depth,

we have guys on the team with‘

mobility. ones who will work very
hard,” said ' Stottlemeyer. “With
the proper attitude, we can be
successful.

“Wrestling is a team sport, but
individual performers must also be
looked at,” added Stottlemeyer.
“Glenn Maxwell was an Eastern
champ at 118/ last year, and Tom

help carry the team.” I

Maxwell and,Jones should be
considered the team members with
the most experience under their
belts. Kline and Billy Clark, 126-
and 134-pounders respectively, are
limited in the action they have seen
so far in college competition.
Sophomore Jeff Gordon (142)

The Eastern Eight hasgrown tremendously since its inception in * ‘ ' S
1976. From that first year. when only 8.000 fans attended the '
three-da'y league tournament at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. to
last year. when 31.000 folks witnessed two nights of basketball at
the Civic Arena. ‘the Eastern Eight has shown ‘signs of becoming
one of the nation's most competitive. well-balanced. proﬁtable
leagues.

The most rapid periodof growth for the league came during the
summer. First. former West Virginia Athletic Director Leland Byrd
was named Eastern Eight executive director. Then. a league ofﬁce
in Greentree was established. Ron Steiner. formerly the sports
information director at WVU. was named full-time pub‘licist.-

Some tnore noticeable on-the-court changes will also be seen in
1980. A crew of officials. consis.ting.of 15 Eastern referees, was
established. and the_y will work all league games. This will
guarantee more unbiased officiating. something Eastern Eight
coaches have complained about for the past three seasons.

At the league meeting in May. Penn State announced its
intentiotrto drop 0l.l|"Of the Eastern Eight so it could pursue its goal
as more of a national. independent commodity. While Lion Coach
Dick Harter obviously angered other Eastern Eight members. the
league appears better off now without the Lions. St. Bonaventure.
the newest addition. has a rich basketball tradition. unlike Penn
State. And the_ Bonnies will undoubtedly be a more exciting team -
to watch than Penn State. who set basketball back 20 years with its
slowdown tactics during Harter's first. season.‘ '

Local fanswill be able to keep a closer eye on Eastern Eight
action this season with the formation of a new television package.
Starting January 5. there'will be an Eastern Eight game of the
week produced by DBD Associates of Natick. Massachusetts. in
conjuction with the Hughes Television Network. which will be
‘responsible for the networking "and distribution of Eastern Eight
basketball. KiDl(A-TV will broadcast the game of the week in the
_Pi~~s’but-glt area. I

All setfor this weekend's Lock Haven wrestling invitational are Pitt heavyweight,
Steve “Smoky” Smocharski and 15.0-pounder Ed Bredniak. The Panthers

opened their season with a sixth-place finish at the Penn State Invitational

Saturday.

On the track, the Panthers were equally successful.
Greg Conover easily won the 880-yard run in l:58.3,
while Darren Geary was a winner in the l00G~meter
run. His time was 1:l4.8. The Panther mile relay
team of Dwayne DeFoor, Bud Cooper, Dee Baines
and Larry Shippen was a second-place finisher; .

Who was Robert Morris, anyway?

weekend’s invitational. Bredniak
was out due to an injured thumb.

At 158 is Jones, who will be
backed up by Eric Harris. Then at
"167 is Korth, who Stottlemeyer and
his team label the “comeback kid.”

After competing _at Kentucky under I

Fletcher Carr, Korth has taken
some time off from wrestling.
Although he was a contender in

previous years, this year will tell

whether his layoff has affected his-
wrestling ability.

Rounding out the lineup are Jeff
Wilps (177), Pat Connor (190) and
heavy weight Steve “Smokey”
Smocharski. Smocharski, a senior,
gained much experience last
season in his first year with the

“There are no sure winners this

and wrestle for a lot of good days.
We’ve got to work at practice and
‘show that once we are on the floor,

,,,Coach Stottlemeyer, a three-time
all-American at Pitt, is assisted by

,former Clarion State all-America

Chuck Coryea. They both look
forward to a successful season
in their initial year of coaching on
the college level. ,

“We are very excited to be given

the opportunity that is before us,”
said Stottlemeyer. It is still a
challenge, but we wouldn't be here
if we didn’t think that we can build '
a decentteam here at Pitt.”

The Panthers’ only competition
before the showdown with Okla-
hom_a on Jan. 7 will "be this
weekend, when the team travels to
Lock Haven for another invitational
tournament. The 12-team tourney
will field the likes’ of Ohio State,

While it would be silly to say that Pitt could come

have already proven themselves by placing higher '
than any other tem from the East (13th last-year) at
nationals. . The teams from the West are just too

While his players are praising Hebert, the coach
doesn't hold back when describing his team.

“We have the luxury of having a lot of good
players,” he said following regionals. “We can just
substitute if someone isn’t playing up to. her
potential.” ' ' ’

Earlier in the season, controversy developed within 7

the athletic’department and among Pittsburgh media

I overa trip the team was making to the west coast and

Hawaii. . V
Critics (yes, you again) were asking why the

.volleyball team deserved a trip to California,-when ‘
~ -_volleyb,all was only a “minor” sp'ort. '

Hebert and his team answered these ‘critics with a

A statement that the athletic department had decided to
' 1,7’?--make the volleyball team a national contender. To -
’ ;'do-‘this, Hebert continued, the team" would have to
' face:o'ppone_nts that could give it ‘a_ few lessons in
«great volleyball._ ;  A

. ‘That is exactly what happened. ‘Although the

Pantherettes had several sluggish games and lost to:

some teams they shouldn’t have, they pulled through

to win the Eastern title, and should very well finish in A

the Top 10 at nationals.

What most people don’t understand is what an
achievement a Top 10 finish would be for a volleyball
team from the East. The emphasis on the sport in the
West, especially Hawaii, is tremendous. In Hawaii,
volleyball gets the coverage and attention that
football receives here. Thus, they have more money
and can give out more scholarships,7attracting the
better players. _ ’ ' x. -

If I were offered a full scholarship at Hawaii and
one at-pitt, there would'be little question as to where
I would attend school, despite how much I like it
here. ‘

Critics, I_’m sure this column won’t hush your bad-
‘mouthing of the team forever, if at all. But I. hope
"that when the team is criticized, it is criticized by
someone who knows what. he’s talking about and
