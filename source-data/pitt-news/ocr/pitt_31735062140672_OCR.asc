Tll€ Gin 1:8

It might have been the chilly No-
vember air, the marvelous spirit
of. the Pitt students or the law of
averages that caused the hitherto
clawless Panthers to rise to great
heights last Saturday afternoon,
but regardless of what it was, the

. Pitt team, sporting the most de-

ftermined, courageous, heads-up
group of ball players that ever

_ trod the Stadium soil, scored the

 A season’s biggest upset ‘in collegiate

ranks by beating the unbeaten

l“...!k’.13‘ordham Rams, 13-0.

Edgar Jones delivered the vic-

 tory special delivery last Satur-

  

    
  

day when he continually,astound-
ed the 20,000 people, Jim Crow-
ley’s boys, and a host of New York
newspapermen with his magniﬁ-
jcent play. Jones personally spark-
ed the 70 yard march in the ﬁrst
quarter for Pitt’s ﬁrst tally, then
-intercepted V one of Filipowicz’s
passes for the last score in the ear-
ly part of the fourth stanza.

The Golden Panthers, supposed-
ly a ﬁrst quarter ball club, played
60 full minutes without a let up.
Every run, block, or tackle was
technically perfect against the
Rose Bowl hopefuls, Fordham. It
Was as clean cut a victory as the
Pitt fan has ever seen, for the grid-
ders completely outclassed, out-
played, and outscored their so-
‘called superior foe. v .

Ralph Fife, who was destined to
become a Pitt immortal early in his
sophomore year, won acclaim from
opponents as well as the local fans
for his brilliant defensive play. In
the press box, the hardened grid
scribes ' rightly called Fife the
greatest guard in the history of
Pitt football. He diagnosed every
Ram play and seerfied to be in the
way of the ball carrier at every
turn.

Fordham players and coaches
were stunned by the sudden rever-
sal of form by the Panthers. They
‘came to Pittsburgh expecting noth-
ing more than a breather on their
way to a New Year’s day bowl

“The ﬁnal score-—Pitt 13,

Yelled

last Saturday’s sensational
Pitt win over Fordham’s rose-
bowl bound Rams, those were

the magic words that sent

20,000 victory—crazed rooters
streaming down onto the grid-

pushing, punching
their way towards their he-

they weren’t fast enough. A howl-

the two men, hoisted them up onto
their shoulders, and, behind 120
bandsmen, paraded around the
stadium for over an hour‘ before
returning the tw-o to the Pitt lock-

Pittsburgh police, anticipating
that this same spirit would con-

SWOC Head,
Clinton Golden

Clinton S. Golden, nicknamed the
“John L. Lewis” of the Steel Work-
ers’ Organizing committee, will
address Pitt Town meeting today.

Northeastern regional director
of the SWOC and vice-president of
the CIO, ,Golden will speak on
“Labor and National Defense” in

208 Cathedral at 2:30 o'clock this

afternoon.

Many outstanding labor author-
ities have contended that Golden is
to the Steel ‘Workers’ Organizing
committee what John L.‘ Lewis is
to the United Mine Workers.

“This will be, the most well-
known national ﬁgure Pitt Town
meeting has presented this year,”

~ said William  Seyler, C42, chair-
man of the PTM committee. “Be-
cause of the recent illness of Philip
Murray, president of CK), Golden
has played an. important role in
national labor relations during the
last few weeks.”

Chairman of the discussion will

be Harry Langer, C42, Executive-
committee member of PTM. Dr.
Francis Tyson, professor of eco-
nomics, will introduce Mr. Golden,
who is a member of the National
Defense Mediation board. ~.

Since Golden worked for a rail-
road company and became a mem-
ber of the Locomotive Firemen’s

brotherhood in 1904, he has been
active in the ﬁeld of labor. .

In 1922 and 1923 Golden was
a representative of the Amalga-
mated Clothing Workers of Phila-
delphia. He became affiliated with
the New Jersey and New England
branch of this organization during
1932 and 193.3.

Ex-Governor Pinchot appointed
Golden, who is a native Pennsyl-
vanian, as senior labor adminis-
trator in the Pennsylvania depart-
ment of Labor and Industry in
1934.

After acting as director of the
National Labor Relations board in
this region of western Pennsylva-
nia from June 1935 to June 1936,
Golden resigned to accept the post
he holds today.

A round table discussion on
“Food and a Stronger America”
has been scheduled for the sym-
posium next week. Four women
dietetic experts will address the
meeting. ’ ~

There will be no school, tomor-
row, Tuesday, November II, and
all University ofﬁcés will be closed
that day. '

Pitt News will not be published
Wednesday because of Armistice
, The next issue will appear

 
   
 
 

Pitt students and faculty will begin writing soldiers let--.
ters today to ﬁll an army pup-tent which will be set up in the

Commons room Wednesday.

Reams of paper and piles of envelopes have been placed 4
in strategic places throughout the University for the use of _
the letter writers, who will “spread cheer in camp with as V .

three-cent stamp.”

The three-day letter-writ-
ing drive, ﬁrst effort of the
University to aid morale of sol-
diers, former Pitt men, in camp,
is sp-onsored by the Student-faculty
association.

Ed Tait, C42, and Mary Bowen,
C43, co-chairman of the campaign,
suggested the following procedures

1. Obtain letter paper and en-
velopes today ‘at all Pitt News
stands free of charge and at the
following places in the University:
offices of the dean of men‘ and the
dean of women, information room,
book-store, Tuck shop, offices of
the YMCA and YWCA, and all

fraternity houses.

2. Get the names” of soldiers

 

 oys'- -S F

.  _
from this issue of the Pitt VNewsdo’I'
from lists at the same locations as,
the stationery. '

   

3. Write your letter today 01:,
tomorrow. ‘i

4. Help out the governmenil

(and SFA) by buying your own.
stamps. ' ’ V

V 5. Drop your letteriin the pup.
tent in

nesday morning.

The

idea of writing letters to
former Pitt men in army camp:

originated in the YMCA which in,»
tended to establish a booth (for, in
those who wished to correspond .
with soldiers..A committee, headed »
by John Myers, C44, was appoints: C

   
 
 
   
   
 

ed to supervise the campaign.

Here're Their Addresses C  

The following names and ad-
dresses are those of drafted omol
enlisted men from the University
of Pittsburgh. Some of the names
are mispelled, some of the ad-
dresses are wrong, and many have
been left oat.

But dtm’t. let that deter you,
read them all and twice your pick.
SFA will see that they get to the
right place.

l"lonl<y-tonl< _
Editor, the Pitt News:

To the 471 nice people who sign-

ed the Automatic Coin Phonograph
Petition,
As you read in Friday’s “News,”
the Tuck shop will not be, wired
for sound.

Your petition was opposed by
the administration and conve‘flient-
ly killed by your elected represent-
atives on the SFA executive com-
mittee.

From our point of view we can't
really understand why it was op-
posed. They surely‘ couldn't ob’-
ject to the music, since there is
music in the eighth floor Tuck
shop. They couldn't object to the
phonograph, since the fourth floor
is ﬁlled with them. They couldn't
object to the nickel in the slot as
there .are three “coke” machines
on campus. About all that is left
is the physical sight of the box,
which could be hidden in another
room.

- However they did oppose it, since
.it did not seem to ﬁt into a highly
philosophical discussion of what, a
university should be. Besides they
reasoned that since music boxes are
found in “Honky-Tonks,” the use
of one in the Tuck shop would put
our blue and gold room in the same
category. Incidentally there was

also the legitimate objection to the
possible noise. ' '

ln closing, a word of advice to
any adventurous student who is
tempted to pass around a scroll.
Get phone numbers with every sig-
nature. That way your work will

not have been in vain.

Copper Supply
Priority Rating

Big people, little people, timid
people, determined people——al1. are
part of the crowd that has swarm-
ed into OPM, headquarters in the
nation's capitol ever since the US

government announced its priority
intentions.

On October 30 John W. Weber,
University secretary,’ was a mem-
ber of this group.

Mr. Weber together with‘J. C.
University purchasing
agent, went to Washington to ob-
tain a priority for 30,000 pounds
of copper, a material necessary to
the construction of the cyclotron.

They were granted an A2 rating
for research material. The A2 pri-
ority, however, can not be used in
obtaining material for student
work, but an A10 priority has been
given to the University for mate-
rial to be used in laboratory
courses.

Said Mr. Weber, "‘All accredit-
ed universities and many of the
large companies have received A2
rating. The Gulf Reﬁning co. and
the United States Steel co. are
among the many concerns that
also have the A2 rating for re-
search material.”

Some issues ago there was a
story concerning Betty Smith and

is a better one about Charlie Egan,
who wrote three letters; one to
his mother requesting money, one
to Tom Jenkins telling all about
his recent success with a certain
girl, and ﬁnally, one to a girl that
he wanted to impress. (This last
was ﬁlled with terms of endear-
ment).

‘His mother got the letter meant
for the girl, Jenkins got the one
meant for his mother, and the
“certain girl” got the one meant
for Jenkins. Has anyone seen
Charlie?

Alumn u.sR u ttenberg,”
Leading Union Man

By RICHARD D. EDWARDS

Fortune magazine in its latest’

Round Table conference,’ on demo-
bilizing the war economy described
one of Pittsbur_gh’s leading labor
men:

“Harold J. Ruttenberg gradu-
ated from the University of "Pitts-
burgh in 1935. After organizing
rank-and-ﬁle members of the old
Amalgamated Steelworkers’ union,
later organizing WPAers, he be-
came Research ‘Director of the
SWOC. As such he has been in
the middle of all union negotia-
tions with the steel industry. He

has written much on economic
matters and industrial relations.”

‘ Ruttenberg tool. part in the
Round Table along with 23 other
men prominent in labor and indus-
try. In the words of Fortune he
is “a chunky, positive-minded, ag-
gressive young man who turned out
to be one of the stars of the show.”

Ruttenberg is a type of labor
leader who is no sissy, but who
would probably please even the
hyper-critical Westbrook Pegler.
Being Research Director of the
SWOC means that he has to have
at his ﬁngertips tremendous back-
ground knowledge, and up-to-the-
minute information on all angles
of the steel industry, ready every
day to come to the rescue of lag-
ging ClO negotiations.

Thougrnie is little known at his

own Alma Mater, Ruttenberg has
been a frequent visitor at Harvard

and has written often for Harvard.

publications on economics and la-
bor relations. He is an outstanding
example of the type of intellectual
that gives .,the‘ lie to the charge
that union leaders are just a bunch
of racketeers. ‘ V
At the Fortune Round Table,
Ruttenberg put his ﬁnger squarely
on one of the most important, yet
least publicized, facts of national
defense. To quote from Fortune:
“Industry, according to Mr. Rut.
tenberg, has been geared to make
proﬁts while operating far below
capacity. Now that it is operating
at full production its proﬁts will
be elnormous-—and labor insists Vim
its share of the beneﬁts offull pro-
duction.

The implications of that simple

statement are enormous. It points
to a whole complex‘ of social and

industrial evils: scarcity of produc-_

tion, price-ﬁxing, monopoly, and
misuse of technological progress.
To Ruttenberg, the only way out
of the maze is a greatershare for

‘labor in the leadership an_d plan.

ning of industry and national de-
fense.

One of the most touching results
of the advent of photography is,
we think, the tenderness with which
otherwise calloused individuals
have come to treat babies.

This sudden solicitude came to
our attention as we were combing
the wrinkles into our hair in one
of the dressing-rooms of Cimbel's
Photo-Reflex studio. Sugar-coated
entreaties of “come on now, you
itsy-bitsy ’ittle tootsums pie,” and
‘‘is 00 gonna smile for me, David?
Come on now, David-boy, uh——
itchy-kitchy koo,” although they
left us dubious as to the state of
the photographer’: nervous sys-
tem, nevertheless kindled anew our
fast-sinking faith in the inherent
kindness of men.

We left our post—it was futile
anyway—and let our ears guide us
to the scene of the reformation.

Through the curtain we saw a
beaming oung matron, hands fold-
ed over tomach, smile of approv-
al on her face, rocking back and
‘forth on her heels. Her gaze was
directed at an anemic-looking,

' bald - headed, red - faced infant,
squirming and kicking, and behav-

A ing generally deﬁant.

And standing patiently behind
the camera. was a young man, hair
tousled, brow sweating, smile
friendly but determined.

“Uh-kitchy-kitchy kee,” he re-_

peated over and over again, punc-

tuating his dii-ge with an occasion- ’

al poke in the belly of the child.

We bet he beats his kids at
night. '
_ a a: is

Seductively clad on the cover of
this week’s LIFE, is Gene Tierney,
new Hollywood darling.

On an inside page is a short
resume of the troubles Miss Tier-
ney has had since she came. to this
country.

“In June she married Count
Oleg Cassini, a dress designer,” is

listed as strain‘ number one.

Frankly, we can’t see wher(- this
is so strenuous, unless Mr. Cas-
sini forgets to remove his brass
knuckles when he pats, his wife on
the cheek.

Another complaint is: “In Sep-
tember she had a wisdom tooth
pulled."

There is a pity.

We hereby initiate a society for
the prevention of cruelty to Gene
Tierney.

And when does the next plane
leave for Hollywood?

C ¢ 1

While we were still musing over
the possibilities of sacriﬁcing our-
self to the martyred circle of the
movie bunch, we came across an
item in the Pittsburgh Press stat-
ing that the National Confedera-
tion (in Rome) of Artisan Tailors
has - declared men's trouser cuffs
unsanitary, pro-British and gener-
ally unstylish.

Supporting Italy's economy cam-
paign, they adopted a resolution
declaring cuffs a “waste of per-
fectly good material which should
be used elsewhere.”

In. this gesture of Italy's pomp- .

ous little leader, we see embodied
the rude beginnings of a much-
needed movement.

Superfluous items of dress, we
have always contended, have been
a thorn in the side of progress.

Think how much farther the
women tennis-players of the ’90’s
could have gone had they been rid
of their pounds o'f skirts and petti-
coats.

And the misguided soldiers of
George III might have been more
elusive targets had it not been for
their elaborate, bright-colored uni-
forms.

And Gypsy Rose I.ee—need we
say more? ’

"Clash by ]\/'1'ghz"’P]ays at N1'Xo.n,§
Stanley Receives ”_/in./< Spots”  

At the Nixon

Billy Rose, the midget showman
who is usually indentiﬁed with such
extravaganzas as “World Fair
Aquacuades” and musicomedies
that lean heavily on ribald lusti-
nessihas unexpectedly traded his
frothy festivals for something de-
cidedly less bubbling.

ln short, the pint-sized entrepre-
neur has undertaken to do the ar-
tistic. He comes up as sponsor of

Clifford Odets’ new work, “Clash
by Night," which continues its pre-

New York tour this week at the‘

Nixon. . -

A number of excellent people
.have been grouped together for
this play. There is the talented

Tallulah Bankhead in her ﬁrst new °

part after a two season run in “The
Little Foxes.” Present also is Lee
J. Cobb who does such excellent
character portrayals, and there is
capable Joseph Schildkraut who
has not appeared locally .in many
years.

"Clash by Night" had its pre-
mier in Detroit a couple of weeks
back, went to Baltimore for fur-
ther tuning up, and now comes
here to give zip to a theatrical
season in need of a shot of adre-
nalin.

Detroit critics thought the play
was good. As he did in “Waiting
for Lefty,” “Awake and Sing,” and
“Golden Boy," Odets has chosen
again the great American lower
middle class as the subject of his
latest emotional exercise.

Odets knows his lower middle
classes. He writes of their pleas-
ures and their problems under-
standingly. His writing may not
provide the pleasantest sort of en-
tertainment but it is almost always
pietty vigorous. Detroit thought
“Clash by Night” consistent with

The play tells about a Polish
family in a humble Staten Island
home with its garish installment
furniture.,Mr. Wilski is happy
there, devoted to his wife. Mae

Wilski, the wife, is a high strung,
sharp tongued woman hungry for
more excitement than the dull at-
tention of her mate. When a movie
theatre projectionist comes upon
the scene, drama enters and Odets
has his triangle played against his
usual background of social impli-
cations.

“Clash by Night" promises to
be one of the season's most in-

that Pittsburgh gets to see a play
in advance of a Broadway opening
that is certain to be pretty excit-

TO owman

A touch of old Greece, a recollection of native memories,
was revealed on the faces of the 1,500 Greek-Americans who
ﬁlled the Commons room to capacity last Friday night to wit-_
ness t.I1e dedication of the Greek room.

Long before the colorful procession of University profes- J

‘ sors, the Archbishop Athenagoras, his retinue, young Greek

girls in ancient Grecian cos-

Q” tumes, an Evzone, and oth-
‘ er dignitaries started at 8:30,

the 1,000 seats were ﬁlled, com-
prising the largest crowd ever to

 ._ attend a. dedication.

Nicholas Kalmer, chairman of

 ‘the Greek room committee, made
 the introductory remarks and his
 presentation of the room to Chan-
 ieellor John Bowman.

The Greek
‘Ambassador Cimon Diamantopou-
los gave his government’s blessings
and stated that “the dedication of
the room in America will give add-
ed courage to the beleaguered pat-
riots in Greece. Greece, the moth-
er of democracyand the birthplace

’_  freedom will. never remain be-
bneath the heel of the oppressor
Jaut with spirit akin to the spirit

"exhibited by the heroes of Mara-
H {hon and Salamis will rise to smite

their cruel dictatorial conqueror

‘"180 the earth.”

-He spoke enthusiastically, the

 accomplished rhetor o‘f the old
~ school, digniﬁed with his handsome .
features and his white hair.

it By far, however, the most ma-
festic, the most magnetic, and most

" "convincing was the massive beard-

ed Archbishop. Resplendent in his

J black and red surplice and robes

A the blessed theiroom and delivered
I sincere message to the Greek-
Hellenes present.

The blessing ceremony itself,
Similar to the one used in blessing
9. new house,.required the aid of
two assistants and the St. Nich-
’9las Greek Orthodox choir.

Inhhymn-like fashion, the Arch-

.l)ishop ﬁrst read portions of the

“Evangellion,” his voice a deep

bass reverberating throughout the

_’crowded hall. Weakly in compari-

« Son, his deacon and Reverend Sak-

jellarides of the St. Nicholas church
supplemented him by also reading
With the choir
singing a hymn, the Archbishop
then dipped his cross and a pink
flower into a bowl of water mum-

bling a prayer. This was all done

on the platform outside the Greek
room. . » =’

Then in a solemn procession he
entered the room. And sprinkling
each corner of the chamber with
holy water, and spreading incense
from a gold container, he formally
blessed the room.

Immediately before another word

. could be spoken in the room Lil-

lian Domesticus, secretary of the
Greek room committee attired in a
ﬂowing yellow robe of classical
Greece, read a portion of Homer’s
Illiad, using as a text the original
book used in the ﬁrst Greek class
at the University.

Again the Archbishop came to
the microphone to speak. Turning
to Chancellor Bowman he profess-
ed his admiration, love, and re-
spect for him.

“As each day passes,” he said,
“my love and admiration for you
increases.”

Then turning to the audience he
complimented the committee, the
designer John Travlos of Athens,
and Demitrios Kokotsis, the fa-
mous Athenian painter who took
almost a complete year to pains-
takingly hand-sketch and paint the
intricate designs on the ceiling,
walls, and on the two ionic and one
corinthian columns.

At the completion of his mes-
sage and the concluding remarks
by Kalmer, Dr. Whitford Shelton,
professor and head of the depart-
ment of modern languages, gave in-
structions for the recessional.

Into the room in single line ﬁled
a two hour long stream of proud,
eager Greeks. Some openly cried
as the appearance of the room
brought back sharply the memories
of their native land.

The theme of the whole cere-
mony stood out in Nicholas Kal-
mer’s statement that “we dedicate
this room to the University know-
ing that it will forever be the sym-
bol of freedom, tolerance, and lib-
erty. It shall be a piece of Greece
in America.”

Minister of Greece

Nervously smoking a cigarette
iust before he gave his address at

lithe dedication of the Greek room,

Cimon Diamantopoulos, minister
of Greece to the United States,
said, “I think the idea of the na-
jlsionality rooms is splendid; it

While being interviewed in
Chancellor Bowman’s office just
before the dedication of the Greek
room, Mr. Diamantopoulos said
while there was no direct news
from Greece they knew the two
Creek universities in Athens and
Salonika were closed and the stu-
dents there were working for the
freedom of the country.

In commenting on what effect
he felt the world situation would
have on students he declared,
“Students have a lot of lessons to
get from the present situation in
order to be able to build in the
future a better and happier
world.”

His speech, he said, “was a de-
Velopment of the idea that the
free peoples of today are the right-
ful heirs of the ancient Greeks.”

Mr. Diamantopoulos was enter-
tained, before speaking at the dedi-
cation, at a luncheon Friday after-
noon in the Schenley hotel after
attending a seminar on Greek Lit-
erature by Professor Emile Mala-
kis of Johns Hopkins university in
Baltimore. Miss Blossom Henry,
associate professor of modern lan-
guages, presided. Early the same
afternoon a luncheon honoring
Mrs. Diamantopoulos was given by
the women members of the Greek
committee in the Twentieth Cen-
tury club.

Greek Church
Head Predicts

Student Future

By B'ETTY McMAHAN
The carefree college student of

today will soon be converted into
a more serious thinking person,
fully aware of his responsibilities,
Archbishop Athenagoras, head of
the Greek church in the Americas,
predicted last Friday.

During an interview before the

r. .. ay,  ~19.-.1941  

opening of the Greek room, the '

Archbishop said that the present
world crisis would so affect stu-
dents that they cannot help but
become more conscious of the
problems they must solve; and that
they will become students “in the
ﬁner sense of the word.”

“They must face the future-

they must,” he said as he struck the .

marble ﬂoor of the Greek room
with a long silver-headed staff.

Clothed in a black “rason,” or

r

i
.

monk’s robe, the Archbishop stood  s

between two white ﬂuted marble,,,.;

pillars in the room, and said: “They ., M

will prepare themselves, for they
have, oh, so many things to solve.”
“This generation, your genera-
tion, must do it. More toleration,
more friendship, more brotherhood
between nations, and more appre-
ciation, will all have their place in
the solving.”

Archbishop Athenagoras were
around his neck a large jewel-stud-
ded “panagia,” or medallion with
a picture of the Virgin and Child
in the center. On his head he wore
the tall round hat of the Orthodox
church with the monastic veil at-
tached.

The staﬂ’, decorated in silver
with the snake of Moses, symboliz-
es the shepherd’s crook and the
guidance it brings to the ﬂock.

On Friday evening the Archbish-
op blessed the room that is the
culmination of the efforts of Greek-
born and Greek-descended persons
who determined to have a Greek
room in the University.

Other famous guests were pres-
ent at the dedication of the room.
Although they had no active part

‘ in the program many of them had
traveled great distances to be here
for the ceremony.

Stravos Theofanides, undersecre-
tary of the Greek merchant marine,
arranged the time of his recent ar-
rival from London to coincide with
the opening of the room.

Elizabeth Robins, famous Ameri.
can actress of the London stage,
was present. Miss Robins has por.
trayed the roles of heroines in
more Greek dramas than any other
lwmg woman since the time of the
Greeks.

Owner and editor of the Nation-
al Herald, most widely read Greek
paper in America, B. Vlavianos ar.
rived in Pittsburgh Friday morn.
ing with Theofanides and Soph.
ocles Venizelos, attache in the
Greek ministry at Washington and
son of the late Elevtherios Veni-
zelos, famous Greek statesman.

Another way has been found for

University students to aid the gov-
ernment in the current defense pro-
gram—and this time it will not
cost them a cent.

The University uses 1,500,000
paper cups a year; 3,250,000
sheets of 8% x11 mimeograph
paper; and (get this one) 1200
cases of paper towels. There are
3750 towels in each case, which
’adds up to 4,500,000 towels per
year. And that's a lot of paper!

Paper has never been a cheap
commodity,sand now the prices are
rising. The next order of towels

_will cost the University about $60
_a month more than the order in use

H ‘ at the present time.

Because wood pulp always has
been imported from the Scandi-
iynavian countries, paper made from

, pulp is and will be the most diﬂ’i- '
cult to get.

Rag. paper would naturally be
the sort to which paper users
would turn, even though it is more

_ expensive. But rags will also be

It took Canton and Cleveland

trip. Dr. Charles W. Lomas, di-

I-~ rector of Men’s Debating associ-

ation; Ed Baldridge, BA42; Hal
Gondleman, C43; and Bill Seyler,
' C42,. president of the group, were
on their annual barnstorming se-

ries with Western Reserve Uni-'

versity, October 29-31. They spoke
to some 6,000 people in the high
schools of _these cities on the sub-
ject of military training before the
present draft age.

A Before each debate, ballots were
distributed so that the audience
could comment on the speakers.
Some of the comments were highly
enlightening and satisfying to the
Pitt men.

A frivolous young thing said she
favored the Pitt'team,lbecause the
cross-examiner was “so awfully
cute.” One of the debaters picked
up this interesting item addressed»
to him. “I think you are marvelous.
I would like a date. My address is
3811 West 143 street, Cleveland.”
The rumor is that he has been
feverishly writing letters to Cleve-

Independents to Begin

Independent association drive for
members will start today when a
booth in the elevator lobby opens

.= to take applications and explain

functions of IA.

Hiram Milton, C42, president,

- said that the purpose of“the group

is to provide a low cost, well-plan-
ned social program to all non-fra-

- ternity students. Any student may

participate in the affairs of the
group, he added. Membership dues
of 25 cents are purely voluntary.

The drive, aimed especially at
non-fraternity freshmen, will be
extended to the schools of engi-
neering and mines later in the
week when a booth will be set up
in State hall.

Pitt’s purchasing department

continue to waste paper it will
eventually come to the point where
the school will not be able to get

An SOS has also been sent to,

Slight Business

Decline Caused  

By Coal Strike.

Business activity in the Pitts-
burgh districtpdeclined slightly" last
niversity Bureau of
Business Research index showed.
The Bureau attributed the decline
to the brief shutdown of captive
coal mines. '

With coal output in Pennsylva-
nia lower last week by 300,000
tons, industrial production and
shipments showed the most decline.
Threatened shortages of bee-hive
coke, used in certain blast fur-
naces, curtailed pig iron produc-
tion. Though the steel industry re-
duced operations for a short time
‘in the middle of the week, the av-
erage rate was lower by only one
or two per cent.»

River shipments of coal and rail
shipments of coal, coke, and all
other commodities were decidedly
smaller. Good volume was still evi-
dent in department store sales as
they were 14 per cent above the
corresponding period last year.

Normal increase in new motor
car registrations also was noted.

During the seesaw movement of
business here for the past eight
weeks the bureau’s index has
ranged between 140 and 147. The
week ended November 1 showed
an index of 141.3 per cent of the
1923-25 average.

last Saturday could have whipped
any squad .in the country, shatter
all their dream castles.

ené-yard line.

This was a dramatic moment
.-for the Pitt students and football
earn, since it was the first time
7 is season that they ever held a
T lead in the bowl game. Not since
he Pui'due*kame when they took
._ he opening kickoff and marched
Tldown the ﬁeld, looking impressive
enough to go right through the
5 stone ‘wall and on to Pasadena,
did the Panthers ever ’ have :-
fchance to go into the lead.

‘ Charley Bowser took on a bright
cheerful smile at this point, and
“Sleepy Jim,” no doubt, became
very much awake to the goings-on.
Coach Jim Crowley's boys came
out on‘ the field in the second half
xpecting the Pitt footballers to
7‘pull their weekly el-flopo, bﬁt the
angle Cats were inspired and
eyplayed even better ball than
rthey had in the previous quarters.

 STEPHEN SINCLAIR’
 “He took the pass from center”

 probably the commonest expres-
sion in football, for the center is

the man who begins every play.

r.I-Iis is a position of great re-
ponsibility for he is the key man
sot-h offensively and defensively.
His teammates must have conﬁ-
llence in the accuracy of his passes,
because they know that all their
work will be in vain if the pass is
(bad. It is equally important that
he have conﬁdence in himself, for..
just as soon as he begins to doubt
himself, he will become erratic in
his passing. ‘

‘After the center has :.co‘mpleted
his blocking assignment in the
ﬁne, he must pick himself up and
 down the ﬁeld in front of his
hail carrier to block the opponents’
pafety men. On passes the center
" ulls out and blocks the weak side

, Defensii/ely the center is known
is the weak-backer up and plays
pposite the opposing center in or-
Aer that he might protect. the weak

Amazed Fordham scouts who
had watched Pitt against Michigan
and Minnesota had but one ques-
tion to ask the local boys. “Where
were Jones and Fife keptzall sea-
son?” '

Pitt 13-—Fordham 0!

Football crowds all over Amer-
ica were stunned into silence at
that result. At the USAC-Stanford
game the announcer shouted into
the microphone: “Ladies and Gen-
tlemen, your attention please. The
unbelieveable has. happened. Be-
lieve it or not~—Pitt 13, Ford-
ham 0.’? A

Sports announcers labeled this
the “number one football triumph
of the 1941 gridiron season,” Bob
Prince, local broadcaster, called
Saturday's contest the “most thril-
ling football game l've.ever seen.”

And Saturday night, Sam Bal-
ter, of national fame, repeated the
Pitt score three times to his as-
tounded listeners. “Yes, folks,” he
told the radio world; “that’s what
I said——Pitt 13, Fordham 0!”

But happiest of all were the stu-
dents. They sensed a win at half-
time, when they rushed down out
of the stands, and lined the locker
room runway, shouting’ encourage-
ment to" the team as they returned
for the second half. Enthusiasm
was still high after the game when
they set fire to several stadium
benches before .they left the
stands to parade behind the hand
through Oakland's streets. They
still celebrated through Saturday
night, when at their victory dances
they heard Freddie Martin dedi-

‘cate a song to the Pitt team—-
“Why Don't We Do This More
Often.”

center as a protection against
passes. ln addition the center
should be alert, a quick-thinker,
and fairly agile. He should be a
hard, deadly tackler because he is
in a position to make many of the
tackles, and also
to slow" up the

When his team

the center has
several difficult
duties to per-

most: important,

ing diifers according to the system
employed by the team.

In my opinion, the center has the
most responsible job of any man
on the team, the quarterback not-
withstanding. If a guard or a
tackle makes a mistake it may re-
sult in a loss of a few yards, but
when the center makes a mistake
it may well mean the ball game; I
have in mind one incident of last
year's Pitt-Fordham tussle. Dur-
ing the second quarter I was injur-

the game. If you recall, the game

In the two weeks that the squad
has been working out they. have
shown continued improvement,
thhsibearing out the early optim-
ism of Carlson. However, the main
source of the good doctor's op-
timism now, is the showing of
Steve Shuber, sophomore center.

Shuber, 6 foot, 4 inch center
from Butler high, stands a good
chance of crashing the starting
lineup, if he continues to play the
way he has been in the early prac-
tices. He is a good pivot man and
his height gives him one of the
main qualiﬁcations of a “tip-off”
man. 0

recovered on the Pitt 3, from which
they eventually scored. Many then
blamed the center for the loss of
the game. '
There may have been six or
seven .mista es by other members
- of the team that were just as re-
sponsible for losing the game, such
as an end missing a pass, s._ guard
failing to 'make a vital block or the
quarterback calling ‘the wrong
play. .But people don't see those
things. They only remember that
the center made "a bad pass.
So pity thepoor center. He is
forgotten if the team wins and the
goat if the team loses.

Climbtlntol-M 5P°t|i9lIt APD Club Routed By Punks

"Neither rain,

I101‘ SHOW, 1101'

shall stay these couriers from their
appointed tasks,” is the slogan on
the New York city post office. How-
ever, it can very easily become the

slogan of the Punks football team.
Just take out the word “couriers”
and substitute the word “stars,”
and it will ﬁt them perfectly.

Last week they humiliated the
Newman club, 53-0 under normal
playing conditions, and just to
prove that they can play in any
kind of conditions they swam over
a cocky APD seven, 48-0. The
score probably would have gone
far beyond that had not the ref-
eree called the contest with eight
minutes still remaining in the sec-

ond half.

The amazing feature of the
Punks’ play is their uncanny ability
to run, pass, and kick on a ﬁeld
that was completely covered with
water. It was hard enough just to
stand still in that torrent, let alone
play football. Yet these happy-go-
lucky basketball players who make
up the Punks, were able to score
THREE times under those condi-
tions.

The play that stands out in our
mind though was the runback of

the second half kickoff by Bob Art-
man, who ran, or rather slid, the

length of the ﬁeld for a touchdown.
It was so dark and was raining so
heavily that it wasn’t until last Fri-
day, the day after the game that
we found out it was Artman who
had made the run. How he kept
hisfeet on that ﬁeld remains a
mystery to those who saw it.

The Punks are not the only
standout team in intramural foot-
ball this year, for over in the fra-
ternity league a surprising PiKA
seven is riding the crest of four
straight victories. Their latest vic-
tims were the Phi Eps, who they
humiliated by the score of 33-7.
Like the Punks, the PiKA’: play
like a well organized unit.

Their well drilled team is built
around the Wilde’ brothers, Gus"

and Ralph, Dick Fair, and “Chuck”
Page. Gus Wilde does most of the
passing for this outﬁt while the
other three men are on the receiv-
ing end of his accurate heaves.
Page is the blocker on running
plays, and block he does, viciously
and accurately.

The outstanding outﬁt in the en-
gineering loop is the AE&ME
seniors. They passed their biggest
test last week when they knocked
off the AE&ME frosh and sophs
in a hotly contested game. Thus
they are _Well_on their way to an-
nexing the engineering
championship another year.

Led by Dave Mamaux, Marshall
Winkler, Dave Carney, and “Dus-
ty” Rhoades, they have made life
miserable for the rest of the en-
gineers. This team is just another
example of what team play, in-
stead of individual stars will do. It
takes seven men to make up_ a
good intramural team, and not just
one or two stars. A

Thus with the intramural foot-
ball season going into the home
stretch, we take our hats off to
three great football teams, the
Punks, Pi Kappa Alpha, and the
AE&ME Seniors.

"I Need Some Clean Stuff” Familiar Theme
To ‘Scotty’, Keeper of Trees Gym Baskets

“Basket 58, Scotty.” “Hey Scot-
ty I need some clean stuff.” For
the past 11 years these familiar
cries have been heard on the sec-
ond ﬂoor of Trees gym where John
Scott, “Scotty” to you and me, has
charge of the basket room. How-
ever, not many of the thousands of
students who yearly use the gym
know him intimately." This is an
attempt to familiarize “Scotty” to
you. His story is one Worth know-
ing. _

John E. Scott was born over half
a century ago near Bakerstown,
about 20 miles from Pittsburgh.
His forbearers came to America
135 years ago from northern Ire-
land, and settled near “ScottY’S"
place of birth. His parents were
teachers and so it was natural that
he too should become a teacher.

After leaving Pittsburgh Acad-
emy, “Scotty" secured employ-
ment as a teacher in the Reserve
Township school. He remained
there for nearly 20 years. How-
ever, when the United States be-
came involved in the ﬁrst World
War, he left the school to take a
position in a mill. According to
present day standards, “Scotty"
would be holding down a “defense
job.”

The war ended and Scotty left
the mill to work for the Armstrong
Cork company. It was from there

= that he came to Pitt. ’

E

 

This is Scotty's twelfth year in
the basket room, and in that time
he has had contact with thousands
of students. According to Scotty,
each year he believes that boys im-
prove. This does not mean that the
boys he had 12 years ago were not
 But, things have  im-

advanced so far in the past few
years, that improvement in the
boys is only a natural consequence.

Scotty was very reluctant to talk
about himself. He said that there
was nothing about him that would
interest others. Thus, we consulted
James Potts, director of intramural
athletics, who has his office in the
gym. Mr. Potts has had close con-
tact with “Scotty” and told us
some very interesting things that
the modest Scotty had not divulged.

According to Mr. Potts, “Scot-
ty" makes violins by hand, fash-
ioning them after the famous Stra-
divarius. Some of them are really
works of art. “He is one of the
most conscientious and honest in-
dividuals l’ve ever met. Whenever
.“Scotty” says something you can

      
 

Potts said.\.Potts.a_lsog_  c

In what was supposed to be the
major game of the day, the ram-
paging Punks once again asserted
their Independent League superi-
ority as they easily defeated a sur-
prising APD seven ’48—0. Yes, sur-

prising is the word for this APD‘

team, for, according to their fol-

lowers, they, along with the Punks,

were supposed to be the class of the
league. ' ‘

After Ziolkowski’s second inter-
ception, the Punks started to move
and were never headed. Two more
ﬁrst downs, with Ziolkowski on the
passing end, put them on the APD
twenty, and set up their ﬁrst touch-
down. Ziol passed to Swacus for
the score, and to Shuber for the
extra point. ‘

* Taking the ball once again near
their goal line, the Punks made
ﬁrst downs number four and ﬁve
on Ziolkowski passes, then scored
on another pass, Ziolkowski to

Paffrath. Ziolkowski to Lohmeyer
made it 14-0. 2 “

It was raining as the APD’s

V kicked off, but this did not stop the

point-hungry Punks. On the very
ﬁrst play, Ziolkowski passed to Ma-
larkey for a touchdown. For a
change, Ziol ran around end on the
try for the extra point, and made
it good. ,

Again on the first play after the
kickoff, the Punks scored as Bile-
wich broke through and caught the
APD ballcarrier behind his own
goal line for a safety. Artman ran
back‘ the safety kickoff through
the entire APD kickoff for the
sixth Punk. touchdown.

The ﬁnal Punk score came on a
pass, Ziolkowski to Malarkey, as
the game ended.

crush a heretofore undefeated Phi
Ep eleven 33-7.

The speed and power of the
PiKA aggregation proved too much
for the Neville street team to cope
with, as they marched up and
down the gridiron at will in the
second half of the contest.

The PiKA’s drew ﬁrst blood ear-
ly in the initial frame when a pass,
Gus Wilde to his brother Ralph,
terminated a ﬁfty yard march.
Shortly afterwards they again
scored through the airwaves as
Dick Fair hauled in a twenty yard
heave from Charley Page and trot-
ted across the goal line for the
score.

The Phi Eps’ only tally of the
game came shortly before the half
ended. Freshman “Fig” Dutch
circled left end behind perfect

blocking and dashed ﬁfteen yards
for a touchdown.

The second half was all PiKA.
with Gus Wilde pitching them and
Dick Fair on the receiving end,
they pushed across four more
tallies to run the score to 33-7. The
victory enabled the PiKA’s to re-
main among the rapidly diminish-
ing ranks of the undefeated.

The Phi Delts managed to
punch their way to two touch-
downs in the first half of their
game and eke out a close decision

over the Sammies, 12-6. Rain also
marred this game.

In other games the Phi Kaps I

earned a 1-0 overtime ’decision
over the Sigma Chi. Because the
Phi Kaps advanced the ball further
than Sigma Chi, they were award-
ed the victory, although neither
team scored during actual playing
time.

The Dive Bombers’ extra point
was their margin of victory over
the Newman club in another Inde-
pendent grid tussle. The score was
7-6. The Sammies at least could
show one victory for last week,
when they whipped the Phi Gams,

tion. '

the Phi Delts by a 30 score. The

league, the Phi Gams emerged vic-
torious over SAM, 3-0. The Phi

resulted in a double forfeit, both

said that “Scotty’s" sage advice

has a definite influence on the boys

that come up to the gym.
Touching on the present war sit-

uation, Scotty said that he hoped

that we would not send any men to
foreign battleﬁelds again. He said
that many of his students were in
the last war and never came back.
He hopes he will never see Ameri-
can youths leave on such a mission
again. ‘

Concluding the interesting inter-
view, “Scotty” said, “Things are

different now. There is better op- :

portunity for boys, in fact every-
thing is better now.” ,
