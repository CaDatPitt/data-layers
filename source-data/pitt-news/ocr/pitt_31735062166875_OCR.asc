‘Draft - Not Doperak, Schueler Race for Presidency

Punishment’

— Posvar

Dr. Wesley W. Posvar,
chancellor of the University
has expressed strong agree-
ment with the intent of Sen-
ator Edward Kennedy’s
proposed amendment to the
draft law which would prohibit
Selective Service Boards from
subjecting student protestors to
immediate induction. (See Ken-
nedy story——-page 3.)

Dr. Posvar offered his views
in a letter to- Senator Kennedy.
Similar letters went to all mem-
bers of the Pennsylvania con-
gressional delegation. The let-
ters expressed the agreement of
the University’s Faculty. Senate
Council.

Speciﬁcally, the legislation pro-
posed by the Massachusetts sen-
ator would prohibit Selective
Service Boards from decl.aring
students and others delinquent
subjecting them to immediate
induction for any reasons other
than those provided by law. It
would not, however, prevent the
reclassiﬁcation of students who
-burn draft cards or take some
personal action that would nor-
mally change their draft status.

“To use the draft as a punitive
instrumemt against those who
engage in student protest activ-
vities is, in my opinion, not only
improper and unfair, but also
clearly "contrary to the most im-
portant substantive and proce-
dural guarantees of the Consti-
tution,” Dr. Posvar said. The
chancellor said such use of the
draft would inhibit free expres-
sion and free assembly and
would substitute the judgment
of Selective Service Boards for
the judgment of the courts and
congress.

“At a time in their l.ives when
young men are first learning to
deal with society's rul-e-s and
processes as responsible adults,
they should not be placed under
an arbitrary threat of the kind
suggested by General Hershey,
which is, in my view, antithetic-
al to the basic premises of our
political system.”

The letter continued:

“Further, as a former mili-
tary officer, I must register
strong disagreement with the
use of the draft as ‘punishment’

_ for illegal activity of any kind.

“The armed services should
be neither the province of an
elite mili-tary class nor a place
of punishment for the lawbreak-
ers and the disaffected. If a per-
son is guility of an illegal act,
he should be punished as pro-
vided by law, not drafted into
the armed forces where the lives
of. others may depend upon his
actions. If he is not guility of
an illegal act, he should be
treated in regard to the draft on
the same basis as anyone else.”

end event, will be held in the
Student Union Ballroom begin-
ning at 8 p.m. Saturday. Spe-
cial movies will be shown as an
added attraction.

Chairman Jeff Zdrale com-
mented, “I want to clear up the
reason that this year’s weekend
will have no mid-week concert
with professional entertainment
this year. Contrary to what
many people think, the reason
for no concert is not because
there was no auditorium avail-
able in which to hold it. The
committee and I merely decided
that a dsance-concert evening of
entertainment and a show that
made use of the talent we have
right here at Pitt would be a
refreshing change from some of
the less than sensational pro-
fessional groups that have en-
tertained in concerts at Pitt in
the past.”

Tickets for Winter Weekend
will be priced at $3.50 and are
tentatively scheduled to go on
sale Jan. 17 all over campus.

 

   

 

At Head of Two New Party Slates

Two parties have entered candidates in the ten-day
campaign. that opened yesterday fo-r Student Government
(SG) executive and legislative offices.

George Doperak of the United Student Association
(USA) and Ken Schueler of the Positive Action Team
(PAT) will battle for the presidency of SG. Doperak and
Schueler, both juniors, View a lack of student involvement
as a central issue in the campaign. Specific programs and
proposals of each party will be presented in respective
party platforms,_which will appear in the Pitt News

E Wednesday.

Ruch Fugo, Liberal Arts junior, will campaign for the
SG Vice-Presidency on the USA ticket. Schueler will have
Frank Tutino, Engineering junior, as a running mate.

Doperak Boasts
SG Experience

George Doperak, USA presi-
dential candidate, is a junior in
the Sch-oo-l of Pharmacy with a
2.91 QPA. He has served for the
past year as that school's rep-
resenttaive to SG, where he also
served on the Health Center
Committee. Doperak is business
manager of the Pitt Capsule,

-the pharmacy magazine. Doper-

ak is also a member of Alpha
Zeta Omega fnarternity, Pi Del-
ta Epsilon (honorary journal-
-ism fraternity), and the Ameri-
can Pharmaceutical Association.

Doperak’s running mate, Rich
Fugo, is a biology. m-ajor with
a 2.94 QPA. He has been pub-
licity director of Mad House for
two years. Fugo served on the
WPGH staff and the SG Tradi-
tions‘ Committee. He is presi-
dent of -the ad hoc Student Com-
mittee for Action on Athletics
and has been named the Instru-
ment Society of America Na-
tional Scientist of the Year.

Doperak commented that the
“USA party was founded in or-
der to provide rational new lead-
ership and to make SG more
meaningful to larger numbers
of Pitt students. Our platform
provides realistic and feasible
programs to create greater in-
involvement on campus.”

In his campaign, Doperak will
be visiting fraternity and dormi-
tory houses. He and his run-
ning mate and senatorial slate
will participate in an SG Elec-
tion Forum Friday at noon in
the SU Ballroom.

Students Need

‘Confidence’-Pat ,

Ken Schueler, PAT presiden-
tial hopeful, is a philosophy ma-
jor with a 3.25 QPA. He believes‘,

“The students have lost conﬁ-

dence in their effectiveness as
an interest group, resulting in
iindifferenlcels and loss of stu-
dent participation.

“Our team believes -that the
enamels of student articulation
must be reopened,” continued
Schueler. “Student conﬁdence
must be restored and backed by
student leaders and strong bar-
galininvg positions. Only then will
students’ pleas cease to be frus-
tration relief.”

In seeking the position to ful-
ﬁlll this goal, Schueler points to
his experience as president and
secretary of Zeta Beta Tau so-
cial fmaterniity. He has also
served on the Secondary Schools
Committee, Men’s Dormitory
Council, Intra.fraterni»ty Coun-
cil and the Freshman Soccer
team. ,

Tutino, PAT vice-presidentisal
candidate, is in industrial engi-
neering with a 3.53 QPA. He is
president of the Engineering
Student Cabinet and is an SG
senator from engineering. In
SG, he served on the Off-Oam-
pus Housing Committee and the
By-Laws Committee. He is a
member of the Student Affairs
Advisory Committee and record-
ing secretary of Phi Kappa The-
ta social fraternity. He is also
a member of Druids, leadership
-honorary, and Sigma Tau engi-
neering honorary.

“Paper Lion”

Writer Sees Football
In A Human Light

. by HOBART HARRIS

Now that the football season is at long last over, it is time to
review something new. A book about football. The book is Paper
Lion, and the author is George Plimpton, sometime editor of that
Itome of football lore, the “Paris Review.”

Plimpton decided that it would be a nice idea to spend the sum-
mer trying ou.t for some pro football team. After being rejected by
quite a few, he was ﬁnally able to convince the Detroit Lion man-
agement that he was just what they needed in the way of a “last
string quarterback.” So, in the Summer of 1963, Plimpton, George
(lheight, 6-4; weight, 192; age, 36, college, Harvard), packed some
underwealr, a pair of cleats, and a football, and headed out to Cran-
brook School to try out for the Detroit Lions.

The book is about his weeks in the training camp there, his
ta-mival, in roduction, and eventual acceptance as a member of the
rtelalm. I think that the book is so good—its tremend-ous——-because
:P'li1np‘ton is constantly able to capture the emotion content of each
of his moments on the team. Anyone could write a book about
wlh-alt happens in a football training camp, bu-t only a few people
‘could become part of that camp, a member of the team, a drinking
buddy:

The ﬁrst thing that -strikes you about the book was the speed
that Plimpton did become accepted, and moreover, persotnally in-
volved in the team. .Plimpton seemed to be constantly reporting
how he felt being part of the team, how he ﬁtted into the fellow-
ship and kidding that pervaded every minute of the time at Cran-
brook. And these things are fun to be in, fun to read about.

However, the most important part of the story was P1impton’s
attempt to- mlaske it with a pro team. In a preseason scrimmage in
‘Pontiac, Plimlpton was sent into the game to run a five-play series.
fit was announced to the crowd that he was a writer, and the crowd
had settled down to watch the slaughter. And that's just what it
was. Somehow, Plimpton fell down the ﬁrst play he ran, missed a
lhl8.lI'lId'0ff on the second, threw a bad pass -on the third, and went
on like that until he left the game, thoroughly humlliaited.

' .B11)l', here is where Plimptonls reporting came through the best.
Corning off the ﬁeld, he heard the fans applauding him, applauding
a total failure. Why? “I decided it was in relief . . . if by some
chance I had uncorked a touchdown pass, there would have been
wild acknow'1edgement—4bu.t afterward the spectaators would have
felt uncomfortable. Tlhe oustsi-der did not belong, and there was
comfort in that being p-roved.

Read the book. It is about football, but it is also about people:
how they face ‘being a rookie, how they face being old, how they
see the order of the world, and most of all why no rnaltter how
Iheroic the deeds, the actors are still human beings, a part of the
world like ourselves. °

Studeét B100d D0113ti011S Bill Opposes Draft as Punishment
Replenish Area Inventory

by TONI GROSSI

An emergency situation at the
Central Blood Bank of Pitts-
burgh necessirtaited a crash don-

‘or program at the University
Tuesday and Wednesday.

Thirty-nine students and fac-
ulty members contributed blood
at the temporary donor-station
set up on the ground ﬂoor CL.

The Blood Bank sent Muriel
A.rber, three nurses, four beds,
and a maintenance man with its
“Bloodmobile” to the University
in an effort to replenish their
inventory from the emergency
level of 35 units to the 500 units
of bIOl0d usually kept on hand.

Mi-ss Arber, director of Donor
Procurement at the Blood Bamk,
attributed the low supply to the
high ratio of Allegheny County
virus victims and the cold
weather. “The normal source of
donors is also down,” she stated.

The Blood Bank is a non-proﬁt
making organization affi=liated
with the American Association
of Blood Banlks. Itwas Creallied
by a grant from the Mellon
family, the University, the J un-
ior Ohamber of Commerce and
interested businessmen under
the guidance of Dr. Ned G. Max-
well of the University 15 years
ago.

It serves 21 member hospitals
in the Pittsburgh area and any
non-member hospitals in Alle-
gheny County needing blood, it
any is available. Trucking serv-
«ice goes -to member hospitals on
a 24 I10lllI' basis and three times
-a day on routine inventory
«checks.

Two. member hospitals delay-
ed major surgery Tuesday morn-
ing due to the Central Blood
Banks low inventory of the
blood type needed. Of the most
frequently used blood type, 0
positive, only two units of the
usual 150 units were available.

Miss Arber made arrange
ments ‘ with Dean of Men Her-
bert McGibbeny for the tempo-
rary Cathedral donloir center.
The University is one of 250 pos-
sible con-tact groups available
in case of emergency blood
needs at the Blood Bank.

All equipment, nurses, fees,

    

etc., are taken care of by the
BBank. The University supplies
the space and the potential don-
ors. Up to 32 donors can be pro-
cessed in a four bed set-up in an
hour.

The prospective donor must
be over 21 or have the written
consent of a parent or guardian.
He first fills out a card contain-
ing “28 questions” about his pre-
vious health problems.

The screening nurse then re-
asks these questions and clari-
ﬁes any prolonged health prob-
lems. The donor's blood is typed
into one of the eight categories
and he is given a card to keep
in case of an accident with the
correct typing.

FLORAL LANE
DALJPHIN, PENNSYLVANIA l70IB

WASHINGTON (CPS) ——Sen-
ator Edward M. Kennedy (D.-
Mass.) has introduced a bill that
would make i-t illegal to use the
draft to punish ainti-war demon-
straitors.

Under the bill, such punish-
ments are left to the courts and
the Selective Service System is
prohib-i-ted from reclass-ifying or
in-ducting persons because of
their participation in demonstra-
tions against the draft, legal or
illegal.

Kennedy said he was intro-

Campaign Commentary

Page 4 — THE PITT NEWS — Monday, January 15, 1968

Editorial: Off and Running

The opening of our annual Student
Government (SG) election campaign greets
us with the (calm before the storm. It is

. difficult to believe that in just ten days

students will go to the polls to cast their
ballots. The only signs that an election
campaign will soon be underway are the
bits of “information” that leak from each
party. Hopefully, the two parties that will
be competing in the upcoming election will
now vigorously bring their respective cas-
es to the members of the student body.
Unlike previous years, both parties this
year are newly formed. The Pitt Progres-
sive Party, formed three years ago, has
dissolved. There are now signs of reviving
either the successful S.U.R.E. ticket of two
years ago or last year’s A.R.A., which was
headed by our current administration.
Both of this year’s participating organiza-
tions have names that as yet do not ring a
bell——the Positive Action Team (P.A.T.)
and the United Student Association
(U.S.A.). '
While both parties boast new names,
each ticket has an incumbent senator in

‘g ' one of the top spots. The U.S.A. has as its

presidential candidate George Doperak,
who has served in the Senate this past year
as a representative of the Pharmacy
School. Frank Tutino, P.A.T.’s vice-presi-
dential candidate, is a senator from the
School of Engineering. A

Ken Schueler, P.A.T.’s presidential
candidate, is new to SG but has served as
a past president of Zeta Beta Tau fratern-

ity, and a member of Men’s Dormitory
Council, the Secondary Schools Committee,
Interfraternity Council, and the Freshman
Soccer Team. Rich Fugo, vice-presidential
candidate for the U.S.A., served as pub-
li‘city director of Mad House for two years.

tee for Action on Athletics. Fugo’s other
activities include WPGH and the SG Tra-
ditions Committee.

All candidates will be making numer-
ous speaking engagements, which will be
publicized in The Pitt News. We urge the
students to utilize this opportunity to view
the candidates under fire, so that when
they cast their vote next week, they’ll be
voting for candidates and what they rep-
resent rather than what amounts to a ran-
dom selection. The candidates will have
to prove themselves during these next ten
days, and increased student participation
can only force those running to more ef-
fectively respond to students’ needs.

Students sometimes fail to remember
that SG is isolated from them only if they
so choose. The students seeking to lead our
SG are our peers, and as students at the
same University, viewing like situations,
we are in a position to judge whom we feel
can do a better job.

Literature will be‘ appearing on the
stands shortly, and the candidates will
now begin to make their seemingly end-
less rounds of public speaking’ engage-
ments. We urge students to not sit this
one out” on the sidelines. '

Movie Fan
Knocks Review

After reading the review of
The Graduate in Friday’s' nevvs-
paper, I feel that The Pitt News
might better serve its theatre-
going readers by publishing
more carefully written reviews
which capture the true feeling
of the production being analyzed.

I have already seen The Grad-

 uate twice, and if I hadn't been

so captivarted and entertained by
the movie I doubt that I would
be Writing now. I deﬁnitely feel
that Miss Dorn’s review did not
capture the true feeling of the
motion picture. y

True, the film was a comment
on middle class materialism and

 an accurate reﬂection of the

 facing the American col-
lege youth. But the ﬁlm most
certainly wasn't an attack and
all the criticizing and moma1iz-
ing that Miss Dorn refers too
were n-ot forced upon the view-
er.
Rather, the movie was easy-
to -watch, witty, entertaining,
well done; all the messages are
delivered to the viewer subtly.
It is my feeling that Miss Dorn
hnastriedtoreadalittletoo

The Graduate is en1terrrtain-
Wli;t'h a message. The dialogue is
so well done that even the corny
jokes come out funny. The act-
ing is superb, considering Dus-
tin Hoffman is a relative new-
comer. And I agree most hearti-
ly with Miss Dorn that the Si-
men and Glacrfunkle score was
extremely effective.

Finally, I should like to take
issue with both Miss Dom and
The Pitt News in one other re-
spect. Story lines, especially the
whole story line, -have no place
in reviews. Maybe I’m being sen-
timenrtal, but Miss Dom never
should have revealed the end-
ring; nor -should The Pitt News
ever have printed the picture
from the last scene of the pic-
ture.

I  almost anyone else
that has seen the movie will tell
you that it is an excellent ex-
ample of putting a message
across without beating it over
the viewers’ heads. I don't feel
Miss Dorn made this clear.

It is our opinion that because
of the way the Pitt basketball

its win over Temple University

College Newspapers

An Honorable Task

by Michael Brourman

“HODDING CARTER, the progressive publisher of the Mis-
sissippi‘ Delta-Democrat, resigned today as adviser to the Tulane
University Hulabaloo, the campus newspaper.”

To the wire services it was only a filler, but to journalists
it meant a great deal more.

The issue at Tulane was a story in the HULABALO0 about
an attempt by Tulane campus police to prevent the Student for
a Democratic Society from distributing a pamphlet which con-
tained allegedly “dishonest and obscene” remarks.

REPBINTED IN THE HULABALOO story was the offending
paragraph which dealt with the “imagined perversions of a
campus police official” in four-letter words.

After seeing the story, Carter angrily denounced the HULA-
BALOO staff as “dishonest little jerks,” and then resigned.

What happenedat Tulane is only the latest in a series of
explosions that have rocked the collegiate journalism world.
And, unfortunately the Tulane incident seems to be part of a
growing trend among student newspapers.

THEY HAVE ABANDONED objectivity and fairness in
favor of biased sensationalism, and in the process have distorted
and distended the true purpose of journalism into an ugly bent.

Opinion from all points on the political spectrum has a place
in the newspaper. Part of the process of maturity is being thrust
into contact with opposing points of view, and learning to grap-
ple with them.

But, when stories are slanted, when bias and ideology take
precedence over fairness and objectivity, then a paper has lost
any value above and beyond that of a propaganda sheet.

A TRUE JOURNALIST must possess many qualities. First,

he must be technically proﬁcient; he must have full command of _

his subject. Second, he must be able, through his creative ability,
to transmit his thoughts to others. .

Third, he must possess intellectual integrity. This above all
else is important. Without honesty, the most brilliant technician
and stylist can not claim the distinction of being a journalist.

And it is this overwhelming integrity which seems to be
missing from many of today’s college papers. The editor of one
such paper told NEWSWEEK, “If we represent the students’ views
it’s purely on accident.”

IN THEIR OWN WAY such newspapers are no better than
Southern papers which distort the role of Negroes or than the
publications of the John Birch Society and the Communist
Party. _ ‘i

There are few, if any, professions which demand more of
a man than communications. To theéjournalist falls the task of
informing man about the world that surrounds him; a world
which has reached a state of complexity making it a necessity
for the ‘common man’ to be as accurately and completely in-
formed as is possible. i

This is not really a task, it is an honor, and as such it must
be taken seriously. Those who wish to make student newspapers

their own personal ideology sheets must learn that the measure '

of a journalist is his ability to report with honesty and fairness
that which he disagrees with as well as that which he agrees
with.

To Watch,

‘Donnie’
by GEORGE LIES

’ Associate Sports Editor
Ten years ago, crowds

P "flocked to Fitzgerald Field

House to see a young,
bright - eyed, 5-8% basketball
gucard set ten school scoring
records. _ .

That same player led his team
to two NCAA Tournaments and
was na-med to the 1958 All-
American team which included
Wilt Chamberlain, E-lgin Baylor,
Oscar Robertson, and Guy Rog-
ers.

That man, Dr. Don Hennon,
was honored Saturday for “Out-
standing Achievement on and
off the Basketball Court,” by
the Pittsburgh Basketball Writ-
ers Association between the
halves of the Penn State game.

Dr. Hennon, or “Donnie,” as
Athletic Director Frank Carver
still calls him, accepted the

award with worthy gracious-

ness.
His words of acceptance were
muffled by poor acoustics. And
the years had add-ed a slight bit
of gray, and had added 15 more
pounds to his 190 pound play-
ing weight. . -
But Dr. Hennon’-s bright brown

, eyes could almost tell the story
‘ of his choice of a professional

life in medicine rather than the
nomad life of a professional ath-
lete. 4 .
.His life’s goal was to become
a doctor, but the challenge of
pro ball did enter his mind once.
“I tried it with the Cleveland

‘ Pipers (of the Industrial League)

but traveling was bad and we
never ate. We would eat hot
dogs. It wasn't for me,” Hennon
remembered.

“Basketball was a stepping
stone. I played it, then it was
over,” Hennon said.

“The award was very nice of
(them (Writers), and I remem-
ber that big thrill of making the
All-American team along with
those four Negroes. It was an
honor to be named with them.”

Hennon’s ﬁve - year - old son,
Donnie, has already taken after
his father. “He’s ﬁve, and he

Penn State Outclasses

Cager Quintet, 6643

Before 847

and a fish

Panther basketball coach Bob Timmons attributed
Saturday’s 66-43 loss to poor shooting and lackadaisical
defensive play. Others pointed out the Panthers’ inability

to penetrate Penn State's zone defense. But most of the crowd of

847 vocally put the blame on Timmons himself.
Like the guy who tossed a dead ﬁsh on the court to express

his happiness over the Panthers’

jprowess. “No, it wasn't the ﬁrst

«time that happened,” Timmuons
replied to a grinning reporter’s
question aftesrwvards. “They did
it to us one night down in West
Virgi.nia.

If the basketball team plays
the rest of the season the way
they did Saturday, Horse Czar-
necki and his groundscrew will
‘be able to compete with Full-
ton’s ﬁsh market.

Timmons d=id’nt get the crowd
off to a good start. He started
-Pete Smith and Steve Steven-
son in the backicouart, hoping
their defense would combine to
throttle Penn State's guards.
Neither Smith nor Stevenson,
however, could do anything of-
fensively, so aﬁter seven min-
-utes had gone by, the game was
tied, 7-7.

It wasn't until then that Tim-
mons replaced Stevenson with
Bob Petrini, his top scorer. “We
hadhoped to use Steve to tire
out (Jeff) Persson, S-tate’s top
ballplayer,” the coach explained.

His original strategy called for
his three in-side men, Rob Mc-
Farland, Mike Patcher, and Ken
Boullens to work free in close.
Their task was easier on the
:blackboard than it was on the
court. It actually took the threat
o-f Petrini’s outside shot to nudge

Withers Sparks First Win

Cubs Clobber Point Park, 74-59

by JERRY GRUEBEL
Coach Tim Grgurich and

his freshman basketball ,

team met Point Park Satur-
day afternoon loo-king for their
first victory; they got it. And
the Cubs, winning 74-59, made
it look easy to the handful of
people who watched the game
at Fitzgerald Field House.

After Bo-b Gailuls scored on a
driving layuep, center ’I~‘~om With-
ers hit two jump shots to give
the Cubs a 6-0 lead which they
never lost. And they led by as
much as 22 points midway in
the second half.

But Grgurich pointed to a
good defense, not offense, as be-

At the rate Pitt basketball is
going, another Hennon would
be great. But 13 more years may
be a little too long to wait for

  

ing responsible for the victory.

“We played a strong defensive
game,” said Grgurich happily.
“We held Point Park to only 18
ﬁeld goals.”

Despite the victory, Grgunich
still seemed a little disappointed.

“Our shooting was poor,” ex-
plained Grgurich. “We only hit
on 29 out of 84 shots from the
ﬂoor. And we still made a few
bad mistakes.”

But Inistakes can be expected,
not only from a freshman team,
but any team. And the Cubs
made much less mistakes against
Point Park than against their
ﬁrst tw.o opponents. Overall,
Grgurich was happy about his
team's performance.

“We're starting to jell,” said
Grgurich after the game. “We
played well.”

Grgurich singled, out Tom

his

  

tionally ﬁne game. Withers hit
on seven out of 15 shorts and
added ﬁve free throws to lead
the Cubs in scoring with 19
points. His ten rebounds were
also a team high.

The Cubs’ rebounding also
pleased Grgurich.

“Our rebounding was real
good today,” explained Grgurich.
“Mike Riggle, Tom Withers, and
Bob Gailus were really hitting
the boards. Our rebounding to-
day was the best this year.”

‘But what made Grgurich the
happiest was the win; their ﬁrst
wvin.

“Now the boys know they can
win,” Grgurich explained about

freshman players. “That g .mo.nS shuffled, 10 players and
, . . . . . .

 

open State’s zone. But unfortu-
nately for the Panthers, Petrini
couldn’t ﬁnd the range, wind-
ing up with only eight points.

After inanaging to tie the
game at 14, the cagers ﬁnally
fell apart for good. Penn State

. nan off to a 31-21 halftime lead,

as second guessers questioned
the way Timmons was using his
ballplayers.

The Panthers could come no
closer than nine points in the
second half. They did not go into

the full-court press that had -
worked so well against’ Massa-

chusetts, nor did they ﬁnd a
way to penetrate the zone.

“We couldn't get them to go
out -after State,” worded Tim-
mons with chagrin. “We tried a
man-«to-mran press for a while
but they beat us. So we went to
a zone press and that didn't
work either.”

With nothing working on de-
fense, and by shooting an unbe-
lievable 23 per cent from the
«Panthers added 22 points to
their ﬁrst half total and wound
up with their lowest ‘point out-
put in 15 years. ‘ -

Timmons feels that quirks in
the schedule have hurt his team.
“We had a 12 day layoff after
our best game (vs. Temple, Dec.
22),” he commented. “We could-
n’t build up any kind of mo-
mentum. And then we lost three
on the 1-0 .” Somehow you get
the feeling the team is in the
dumps. —

,One of the encouraging signs
of the afternoon (other than
those sprinkled around the Field
House) was the emergence of
Frank Gustine as a playmaker.
In the game for most of the
second half, Gustine found the
open man with sharp passes,
even if that open man couldn't
do anything with the b-all. Since
he has one of the better shots
on the team, Gustine ﬁgures to
see more action in the future.

His addition theoretxically gives
Timmons nine small, but aggres-
sive ballpl-ayers to interchange.
A coach should be able to for-
mulate the strategy which would
use the Panther quintet and
have four players of about equal
ability fresh on the bench.

Ten years ago, one small, but
aggressive ball player named Don
Hennon scored 45 points for
Timmons in a game against
Duke. Against Penn State, Tim-

Matmen Twice , Swimmers, Gymnasts All Lose

Swimmers’

Lane Cops

Two Firsts

by ARTROSENGARTEN

“We took our eight swim-
mers to compete against
their twenty and no matter
how good we were, the odds
were too great to overcome,”
said coach Bill C-rant summing
up his swimming team’s losing
performance against Bucknell
Saturday afte-rnoon. The ﬁnal
score was 73-40.

The end results do not truly
tell how Bucknell dominated the
meet. “They let up plenty on
us,” said Grant -alt Sund=ay’s prac-
tice. “The Bucknell coach (Blob
Latour) wasn't going to la.y it
on me. He used most of his
swimmers only once, even Ol-
son. Lat-our certainly showed
ﬁne sportsmansohip in the meet.

The Olson which Grant hp-oke
of was the Bison’s outlsuhanding
slophomore swimmer, Gary O1-
son. In Saturday's meet, Olson
broke B-ucknell’s 1000-yard free-
style record with a time of 10
minutes 55.2 seconds. The old
record was 11:01.4.

According to Grant, Olson was
one of the outstanding prep
student swimmers in the United
States. Right now he is the
best freestyler on the team. “He
is real smooth in the water,”
said Grant. “In the 1000 free-
style, he established himself ear-

V ‘ly in the “race and pu-shed him-

self to the record. This boy
doesn’t have to be pushed. he
can perform at his best by 
self.”

It was not all bleak, though.
Co-captain John Lane captured
two events. He was ﬁnslt in the
100 and 500 yard freestyle races.
Other winners were Howard
Norris in the 200-yard but:terﬂy
and Chris Price in the 200—yard
breaststroke.

Grant was not displeased wi-th
the team's performance. The

LARRY CUBA
Only point-getter at Navy

Maryland Stops Wrestlers, 26-6;
Cuba Tie Only Score Against Navy  

by ROY JACOBS

The wrestling team may
have taken a half a step
backwards over the past
weekend. Last Wednesday coach
Dave Adams seemed fairly op-
timistic concerning his team’s
steady improvement so far this
season. It is doubtful that he
feels the same after losing to
Maryland, 26-6, Friday night and

J0 Navy, 33-2, Saturday.

“We didn’t look outstanding
in either,” reported Adams. “We
did wrestle better at Navy. The

cym Team Drops Two
To WVU, Springfield

by CHUCK DWORAK

The gymnastics team,
stung by a recent ECAC
ruling declaring freshman
scores unofficial, lost to West
Virginia and Springﬁeld last
week. The team is now 1-5 for
the season.

A tough Springﬁeld squ-ad
rolled to a 160.45 -108.65 win
over the gymnasts last Friday
at Trees Hall.

Dave Ellis scored a 9.1 to pace
a Springﬁeld victory on the still
rings, and Larry Solomon had
an 8.75 on‘ the ﬂoor exercise and
a 7.25 on the trampoline to win.
Springﬁeld won six of the sev-
en events.

“Springﬁeld was one of the
top teams on our schedule,” said
coach Warren Neiger. “They had
much greater varsity strength
than us, so I decided to use my
freshmen.”

Two freshmen, Lowell Meek
with a 8.35 on the ﬂoo-r exer-
cise and Phil Lilly with a 7.35 on
the sidehorse, grabbed unoffi-

p grabbed four of seven events.

Dave Shidemantle brought the
gymnasts a brief moment/ of
glory when he thrilled the crowd
with a some-rsault over the long-
horse, scoring a 9.75, the top in-
dividual event score for the gym

teamxthis season. The gymnasts
won the longhorse event, 25.85-
24.75.

At West Virginia last Wednes-
day, the gymnasts dropped a
133.15-124.05 decision to the
Moutaineers.
really did well for us in this
meet,” commented Neiger.

“Meek had an unofficial ﬁrst
in the ﬂoor exercise with an
8.65, and Lilly was our best man
on the sidehorse with a 7.65.”

Despite losing, the gymnasts
grabbed four of sevent events.

All-around man Dave _Shide-
mantle had ﬁrsts an the ﬂoor
exercise, trampoline, and long-
of 40.2 points. .

West Virginia led by Ron Curf-
m-an’s 39.2 points, managed wins
on the parallel bans, sidehorse,
and ﬂoo-r exercise events.

“The freshmen

score doesn’t reﬂect this, but
that's because Navy is a super-

—ior team.”

Coach Adarns reiterated his
feeling that the Temple match
was the team’s best showing so
far, alltho-ugh losing 20-14. He
added that the lo-ss to Maryland
was the tea«m’s'worse showing
of the year. -

The grapplers’ only points in
the Maryland match were con-
tributed by Terry Hoover and
Rich Shildt, both via decisions

over their opponents.

“Hoover completely dovm-in-ated
Slinibaldi,” reﬂected Adams, Who
added that Shildt handled his
bout well als-0. For Hoover, it

was a big win, as Terry still

isn’t in his best wrestling shape.

“Ronni-e Schuohert was doing
a fairly decent job against a
real good boy, a sophomore
named Callahan,” said Adams,
“but he lost it near the end.”
Schuohert suffered an injury in
the match which kept him ou-t
o-f the Navy meet the next after-

noon.
Larry Cuba was the source of

the wrestlers’ two points against

the Middies. He drew his 137

pound match. The two previous 4
years the varsity was only able 
to total six points against Navy, ~
so it might be regarded as a. “

typical wrestling performance
against the Naval Academy.
Shildt, who lost his ﬁrst match
of the season, and Jim Rhone
at 167 came close to wins. Shildt

lost a 4-2 decision, partially on .

a stalling penalty that Adams
disagreed with. Rhone lost, 9-5,

b-ult Adams was very happy with

his match.

team in the East,” offered

wouldn't hlave beaten ei-th-er, but
We should have given Maryland
a good go.” ,

Such was not the case. The
squad has a week and a half

until it meets Cornell. Tlhati

should be plenty of time for sub-
stantial improvement. ~
