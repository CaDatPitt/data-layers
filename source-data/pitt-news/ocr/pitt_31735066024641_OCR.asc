Pitt is not experiencing a budget V

crisis, despite~“exaggerated" reports,
Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar said
yesterday‘. Instead, he described the
situation as “secure” and said this
was a period of“serious budget con-
straints.” ’ ,
Speaking at the annual meeting of
deans, department Chairpersons.

-and directors, Posvar said the uni-

versity was “not making cuts at all,"
but rather making “rea.llocations.”
He described as “totally falla-
cious,” rumors that the reallocations
were aimed at certain departments
or that they wereiacross the board.
“We received a five percent
increase in allocations from -the
state." Posvar said. “That isn't

t much, not enough to cover inflation,

but it is enough to do a responsible
j0b of setting priorities, reallocating
funds. making compensation

increases, and with great reg‘ret,..

being forced _ to make tuition
increases that we hope we can keep
within the ballpark of'inflation.”

llnder a clear. sunny sky on a
crisp afternoon in late March. a
young woman is speaking into 21'
microphone. her voice resonating
throughamegaphonethatlookslike
it is left over from World War I. She
is trying to get the attention of pass-
ing students:

“Come May 2nd to protest the

killings in Atlanta and money being-

spent to kill the children of El Salva-
dor. There are millions of dollars
being spent on the murder of El Sal-
vadorian children..."

“So what are we gonna do?"
shouts a passing student.

She is succeeding.

Around her, on the sidewalk out-
side the Cathedral of Learning on
the Student Union side, six or seven
others organize the ‘‘rally,'‘ passing

P out leaﬂets for INCAR (Interna-

tional Committee Against Racism),
offering green ribbons in commemo-
ration of Atlanta's slain children and
selling Progressive Labor Party
newspapers for I0 cents. '

A cloth stretched between two
wooden poles and painted with red,

green and black lettering reads: V

“Join the rally to stop the racist kil-
lings in Atlanta and El Salvador.”
The wooden _poles are held by two
bearded men standing poised like

‘ Roman soldiers guarding the palace.

They won‘t move until the rally
breaks up two hourslater.

It is almost I p.m. Classes are
changing, with students ﬂooding the
sidewalks. This steady stream is not
interrupted by the rally any more
than by a spring breeze. Life goes on
as usual at Pitt.

  The Trials of a Pamphleteer

By GLENN FREUND

A young man in a windbreaker
with short. wind-swept hair is hand-
ing lilyers to students who manage
not to break the stride. “Join the
march on May 2nd...Join the march
on May 2nd against the racist kil-

lings in Atlanta and El Salvador...”

A woman passing by smiles and
says to me, “They‘re sick. (Some-
thing) smash their heads.“

Meanwhile the woman with the
megaphone continues trying to get
students’ attention.

“...The Ku Klux Klan is organiz-
ing from one end of- the‘ United
States to the other end. Th'ere’s evi-
dence the murders were done by the
Klan. of a Klan strategy to infiltrate
the police department..."

A.jogger breezes past the banner,
right through the rally. without even

“...Reagan is giving $50 million to

Instead, as I look down the street, I
see the dream of every rally "organ-

“Someone came up to me and
gave me $5 and said. ‘Good luck'."
Derek is telling me in his l.ondon
accent. “It helps pay for the news-
papers and the activities these kids
do.“

Derek is a part—time machine mill
worker when he’s not laid off and a
part—time organizer at Pitt. He
belongs to a very small party, but he
has plenty of time for it. for selling
of the party newspaper
“Challenge” and talking to students.

’“They (the mill) keep laying me
off and bringing me back, laying me
off and bringing me back.” Derek
says. his hands buried in the pockets
of his corduroy jacket. “My bloody
thumbs are freezing." he complains
as he steps aside. It is almost 60

“I almost cut my thumbs off in a
machine shop accident." Derek
explains. “They had to sew it back

“...Money for’ the (El Salvador)
junta to kill the people fighting what
can only be called a facist military
dictatorship. For the children in
Atlanta, nothing..." the woman is
announcing. A -~ ~

in “Yeah!" replies a passing student.

Derek is heavy-set and stands
straight and still. A pair of circular
photo-gray glasses rest askance on
his gently-round, pink-com-
plexioned face and cover his large,
expressive eyes that ﬂoat at you
when he_speaks in a firm, innocent
way." '

“There's a correlation between
unemployment and murders and
suicides.” Derek says. “The unem-
ployment rate in Atlanta is ‘I4 to "I5

percent. in the _ so-called thriving
capital of the South."

“I‘m not sure I understand the
connection. but it‘s Derek’s turn to
address the rally. and he takes over
the speaker. Except for the accent,
there is little trace ofthc Derek who
was talking to me. He is clearly on
the soapbox. ,

“...Two years and 20 children later
the killers haven't been caught. It’s a
shame and a disgrace in a country
like this..."

Soon another woman takes over.

“Join our rally against the racist
murders...“

Derek comes over to me again.

“These children have no hope,” he

says. “You see a bureaucracy like the ’
police force and you‘re up against a -~

brick wall."

“I admit this is propaganda.” he:
says. “The Press and Post Gazette’

are propaganda. Walter Cronkite is
propaganda. I happen to enjoy Wal-
ter Cronkite. Now I watch the news‘

on Channel I l since Walter left. I if

“Th£§<_?__l<_iQ.S_a_r.t:_t._ he_future.J‘..Derel<_‘

There is no one standing around:

ily in the Quad as a result of RSA’s
main goal: “To get the Quad build-

our proposed policy changes
implemented."

Simoni also hopes to improve
communication between the execu-
tive board and the residence hall
councils.

Robbie The, current president of
RSA, said, “The election turnout
proved that more people want to get
involved with RSA.” He also said
that “the number of candidates this

One major problem the new offic-
ers must deal with is a substantial cut
in next year’s budget due to changes
in the Student Government Board's
funding guidelines. Still, Simoni is
optimistic about next year. “We saw

“By having it outside, we are try-
ing to.create a carnival atmosphere,”
said Al Burke, a member of the
Spring Flingcommittee. “There will
be clowns running around and bal-
loons everywhere.” Rain sites have

part ‘of course work,” Detlefson,
explained. “It also means that if

someone did research for a course,

he or she has probably revised it and

put some effort into it to make it

satisfactory for the course

“Graduate students are more
likely to do research’ for seminars or
for their dissertations, so they
shouldn't be bound by a course
requirement. .

“This is also one way to honor the
research that students have to do
anyway,” she added.

The competition is jointly spon-
sored by the College of Arts and
Sciences Dean, the College of Gen-
eral Studies Dean, the Dean of
Graduate Studies and the Women‘s

bad weather.

Chairperson Sheldon Bogus com-
mented that “this is the big weekend
before finals, and we want to pro-

they can cut loose. We hope this

The three winning papers will be_

David Bartholomae. committee
member of the Senate Educational
Policies Committee. reported on the
advisability ofa university-wide for-
eign language requirement.

He reported that a survey of«the
schools showed little support for an
across-the-board requirement of
two years of high school foreign lan-
guage or one year of foreign lan-
guage at the university forfall
students.

The professional schools
responded that there was no room in
their curriculum for the number of
classes that would be needed for
minimum competency in ‘a foreign
language. '

College of General Studies Dean
Steele Gow strongly opposes the

requirement because itwould cut the .

number of students enrolled in CGS
by half. according to Bartholomae.
Bartholomae added that many
members of the committee found it
hard to defend requiring a compet-
ency in another language above and
beyond requiring a competency in
computers. history or the arts. He
said the committee would make a
presentation of the facts. arguments
and appeals to the administration
for support.
L Professor Richard Pratt, chair-
man of the Special Senate Educa-
tional Policies and Budget Policies
Joint Committee. reported that Pro-
vost Rhoten Smith is still concerned
with some of the philosophical
issues of the proposed evaluation of
academic administrators. However.
the committee is still hopeful that
the rcdrafting process will be fin-
ished in time for Senate Councils
April meeting. '

The Student Ad-Hoc Committee of Financial Aid is conducting petition.
and letter writing campaigns in order to persuade Congress to reject Presi-

dent Reagan’s proposed cuts in the financial aid program. Petitions are being '

distributed by the three student governments. the governance groups and the
graduate student organizations within the colleges. These petitions will then
be presented to a local Congressman in a press conference next month.

Points of Collegiate Volleyball  

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Sports Writer

Two and a half years ago Brian
Devine, of the Panthers men’s .vol-
leyball team spotted one of many

’ ﬂyers hanging on a bulletin board on

the ‘Pitt campus. The advertisement
invited any interested athletes to try

out for the newly formed varsity vol- _

leyball team under coaches Mike
Hebert and Ray Reilly. Thinking
that this was going to be similar to

gplaying the sport in'his highschool.

gym class, Devine decided to go to
tryouts and see if he could become a
part (if the newly formed varsity
team at Pitt. Devine ended up mak-
ing the team that opened up play in
the winter of 1979.

“I hadn't done anything athletic in
my freshman year," said Devine who
had playedfour years of High school

“Then  saw this sign when l was'a
sophomore that got me interested. in
trying out for the volleyball team. I
thought that there would be nothing

‘peopleon each team in gym class.

hadever dreamed.”

Devine found out quickly that
Hebert and Reilly had much more in
mind than a high school gym class
when they fought to bring varsity
mens volleyball to Pitt. it became a
much more demanding sport for
anyone who tried out for the team’
and" Devine had it extra tough
because he had never played the
sport so seriously as the great major-
ity o_f his teammates.

“It was so much more demand-
ing," said Devine. “in high school

there was no speed or force involved, _'

I had never dislocated any fingers
there as l have in my years with
Pitt.“ ,

Hebert and Reilly had to take
their time with Devine since he had
never played the sport so competi-
tively and he was already a sopho—’
more in college. ‘The first year
program was bound to work out if
the two had anything to do with it _
and helping Devine along with his’
play was a fundamental part of
building the prograrh.”

when things start going wrong and a
number of times during that first
year I wanted to just give up and
quit. But they were alwayssaying
,/that it would-happen, it would come
along. I would'have never come
'back the next season if it had not
been for them.”
Hebert and Reilly took the time to
show Devine where his mistakes

were and how to" correct them. He vi

began to learn the ifundarnentals,
which was a difficult task"in itself, a
new learning experience every time
he‘went to practice. 

“They took the time to show me-

what 1 was doing wrong," said.
Devine. “And what I was doing
wrong was just about everything.
First we worked on the fundamen-
tals of passing, setting, and defensive
play, Then last year with Ray, I
worked a lot on my front line play,
hitting and blocking’. Even the
young guys on the team this year,

The Pitt Pantherette Cagers went
to Texas for the weekend and
brought home a two-and-a-half-foot
high trophy for. winning fifth place
in the National Women’s Invita-
tional Tournament and NWIT All-
for sophomore
Penny Welsh. The Pantherettes won
two of threegames in the tourna-

ment. upping their season record to .

22-8. Pitt’s 22 wins this season is a
Pitt‘women's basketball record for
most wins in a single season. as well

’as the highest winning percentage in .

the squad’s history.

The tournament didn’t start out
so well for the Pantherettes. The
Lady Bulldogs of Georgia embar-
rassed Pitt in the opening round.l0O-
69. Pitt never really got an attack
underway as the ladies from Georgia
r\oared on. Four Lady Bulldogs
scored in the double-digits, led by

‘Wanda Holloway with 32. HoLlo- ‘_

way is the younger sister of former
Pitt ‘football standout Randy
Holloway.

The Pantherettes got a big game
from Penny'Welsh, who poured in
23 points. Teammates'Pam Miklase-
vich and Lori Dolby added l8.and
II respectively, but to no avail.

“I guess we just needed to have a
bomb dropped on us to wake us up."
said Pitt coach Judy Saurer. “Geor-
gia certainly dropped a bomb.”

Fortunately, the~Pan_therettes did
wake__ up. Saurer’s charges came
backto humiliate Baylor l0l-8l.
Pitt, up by only six points. 48-42. at

‘the half, dazzled the crowd with its
impressive play. The Pantherettes,
put it all together, hitting _55 percent

holding Baylor to a mere 37 percent
from the field.

In the scoring column. Debbie

and Lori Arent came off the bench

at the half. 48-42. Again. Saurer
pulled her forces together at inter-
mission, and the Pantherettes came

‘' out playinga different style of ball.

Pitt raced to take a comfortable
lead, and time ran out on an attemp-
ted Tennessee comeback. The final
score: Pitt 93, Tennessee Tech 91. It
was a sweet victory at the end of a
long and successful season.

H Five Pantherettes scored  dou- 1

l8 points. Dolby added l6. Lewis l3,
Aughburns l2, and Miklasevich 10

Jerilyn Harper ledthe losers with 47

“It was a /fine tournament,”
Saurer said. “We were.-pleased and

Devine Still Learning
Collegiate Volleyball

contimted from page eight
bins, Devine is a three—year
letterman. '

“He has certainly come a long way
in his three years with us," said
Reilly. “And_with hisjunior eligibil-
ity he will be back again next season.
He has this uncanny sense of_direc-
tion in hitting and serving the ball
that makes him effective. Nobody
knows where the ball is going to go.”

Devine’s teammates respect his
"\ art of knowing what’s going on with
the opposition.

“He has an excellent sense on the
court.” said Barry Goldberg. “lfyou
want to know what the hitters are
going to do,just ask Brian. The way
he plays during a match depends a

great deal on how he starts out in _

that first game...he starts out good
you know it’s going to be a good
night."

Devine is well aware ofhis respon-
sibilities on the court to himself and
to his five other teammates. As a‘
middle hitter his duties areto block

the quick sets in themiddle and help ’

asist with blocks on the outside sets

“He is a very intense player on the
floor," said first year man, Mike
Petock. “He’s always aware of eve-
ryone‘s responsibilities, especially
his own.“ /

Devine has seen everything since
the birth of Pitt mens volleyball. He
is a veteran of sorts although he has
played the least amount of time on
the Pitt team this season. His out-
look for the Panthers success in the
remainder of the season is a very
optimistic one and very bright for
Pitt volleyball in the East.

“This year we have more depth
with a higher quality of playthan we
have ever had since we began play,”
said Devine. “There is backup sup-
port this season that can come into
games and keep us in them. Out atti-
tude is different and we are winning
more.”

So now at the ripe old age of 2],
with junior elegibility, Devine con-
tinues to grow in his collegiate vol-
leyball career. He will still be around

has done in the past three seasons.’

therette to qualify for Easterns.
Perry ran the 200-meter dash in 26.7
seconds at the Virginia Invitational
to notch fourth place. The wiry
freshman came back to take third
place in the same event at the Tow-
son Invitational, crossing the finish
line with a time of 26.4 seconds.

Junior Peri Radecic garnered the
most honors over ‘the weekend.
Radecic took third and fourth-place

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pill News Sports Editor
The Pitt Panther men’s tennis

- team dropped a 6-3 match Sunday

its crosstown rivals. the Duquesne
Dukes, in the first home meet ofthe
season for the Panthers.

Pitt’s No. I and 2 players. seniors.
Doug White and Rip Wagner. con-
tinued their strong season play as
they teamed to win the first doubles
match 6-4. 6-0 over Duquesne's top
two. players. Ri Acri and Frank
Nober. Wagner also upped his sea-
son record in singles competition to
2-! with a 6-l, 4-6. 7-5 victory over

/ Nober.

“The doubles match was a great

_match for White and Wagner; they
just blew Duquesne out," said Pitt
head coach George Diffenbach.
“Both are seniors and are working
hard and playing hard.” According
to Diffenbach, both players have

thanks to some hard work. Wagner
was Pitt's No. 6 player last year and
White was No. 3 until they moved
into their ‘top spots this year.
“They’re both playing good tennis
now and are even with anyone they
go up against,“ Diffenbach said.

In, the first singles match.
Duquesne's Acri battled White to a
split in the first two sets. White won
the first‘ set 6-3 and Acri the second
7-6 before Acre finished strong. tak-
ing the third set 7-5.

“The match could have gone
either way." said Diffenbach.
“White almost had him."

After Wagner's singles victory.
P'itt’s ‘No. 3 player. Mark Weinberg.
dropped a 6-3, 6-4 decision to
Duquesne‘s Mike Levy. Duquesne's
Al Joseph swept the next match 6-2,

6-] over Panther Tony Calderone,

and the Dukes continued to roll in
the singles competition as they went

.on to take the final two‘ matches.

Duquesne’s Lennie Komoroski
downed Pitt‘s.Jeff Brand 6-2. 6-2.
and the.Dukes'Jan Nobers defeated
Steve Berkovitz 6-2. 6-3.

After White and Wagner‘s open-
ing win in the doubles. Duquesne’s

Joseph and Levy came back to down -

Weinberg and Brand 6-2. 6-3. In the
final doubles match. Pitt-‘s Calde-
rone and Berkovitz joined efforts to
defeat Komoroski and Nobers 6-0.
2-6. 6-4. '

“Berkovitz played a very good
doubles match. and he and Calde-
rone showed good teamwork. espe-
cially since this was the first time
they played together this season."
Diffenbach -said. “Berkovitz just
broke into the lineup and played
very, very aggressively, even in.the
singles match he lost to Nobers. He's
going to be a strong player and he's

' just going to get better."

Diffenbach said he wasn't sur-
prised at the strength of the Duke

team or the margin of the loss. The
Dukes finished fifth and Pitt seventh
during the fall portion ofthe Eastern
Eight tennis season. Diffenbach
attributes part of Pit,t‘s eary difficul-
ties to the youg team the Panthers
put on the court.

“The inexperience of the rest of
our lineup. after the first two spots.
is really affecting us." Diffenbach
said. “We need more on-court expe-
rience. By the end of the season we
should become stronger as we
benefit from the playing time.“

The Panthers‘ next opponent is
Westminster College this Friday at
home. The match. which will start at
3 p.m. on the courts below Trees
Hall. could be an important confi-
dence builder for the Pitt team,
according to Diffenbach. ‘The’
Panthers beat Westminster. 9-0 last
season.’ "‘
