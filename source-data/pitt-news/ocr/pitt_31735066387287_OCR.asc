Casey riurns to say "tanks"

By John B. Moore
News Assistant

Thomas Starzl.

One year ago Governor Robert Casey was
fighting for his life and looking for a miracle.
He found that miracle at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center in the form of Dr.

Casey and his wife Ellen hosted a reception
Monday afternoon for Starzl and the other doc-
tors responsible for his double heart-liver trans-

plant at Scaife Hall .

The reception was Casey’s way of thanking
the people who cared for him throughout the

transplant.

under these circumstances.”

Governor Robert Casey visited Pitt Monday to hold a reception thanking those who
cared for him throughout his double heart-liver transplant one year after the surgery.

‘This is probably one of the toughest speeches
I’ve ever had to make,” said Casey. “It’s not
possible to do justice to the people, to the expe-
rience, and to the tremendous sense of elation
and euphoria that I feel today coming back

SGB votes
to u hold
Stu y
Abroad fee

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

Student Government Board
voted to uphold a proposal to
raise funds for a Study Abroad
scholarship fund at the board’s
summer meeting Friday. '

The proposal, which Pitt’s
Board of Trustees will vote on
June 30, calls for a $1 per-term
fee assessed to all full—time stu-
dents in the College of Arts and
Sciences, School of Nursing
and School of Engineering.

The fee would subsidize stu-
dents participating in Pitt’s
Study Abroad program, where
they study for a semester in a
foreign country. Approximately
$26,000 would be raised for the
program if the proposal passes.

According to SGB President
Ross Pasquale, the proposal
was accepted in 1991 after
an opinion poll on the 1991
SGB election ballot showed
that students supported the $1
per-term fee by a 1,044 to 414
margin.

Pasquale also said a petition
regarding the fee was circulated

Soon the William Pitt Union
will be hearing wedding bells.

The question now is whether
WPU’s first wedding recep-
tion, scheduled for June 25,
will be the first of many or
merely a shot—down test bal-
loon. .

In order to generate addition-
al revenue for the building,
Pitt’s administration is dis-
cussing the possibility of

allowing the university com-
munity to hold wedding recep-
tions during the summer and
winter holidays —— when use of
the building is at.a minimum.

The proposal is not yet in its
final draft, according to Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
William Harmon.

Numerous decisions relating
to cost, space availability of the
union and eligibility for the
service would have to be made
before a policy in favor of
receptions or other such events

would be adopted, Harmon
said.

Pitt’s current policy explicit-
ly prohibits use of the union for
wedding receptions.

“The times have changed
such that that’s a policy that
should be revisited and possi-
bly eliminated,” Harmon said.

Harmon said a wedding
reception for Debra DeVitto,
the daughter of John DeVitto,
Pitt’s associate vice chancellor
for business and finance, has

taken this long for all the bud-
geting and legal work to be
done to institute it,” Pasquale
said. “Finally, the Board of
Trustees is going to vote on it
June 30.”

Pasquale said he expects the
fee to be passed at this month’s
Board of Trustees meeting
since the fee is small and the
money will be immediately dis-
tributed to Study Abroad par-
ticipants.

College women drinking more, study says

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

Abusive drinking by college women has
more than tripled over the last 15 years,
according to a Columbia University study
released last week.

The study, conducted by Columbia’s
Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse, said 35 percent of the college
women polled in 1993 said they drank
alcohol to get drunk, compared with 10
percent in 1977.

“It doesn’t surprise me that alcohol
abuse is on the increase,” said Mary Koch
Ruiz, coordinator of Sexual Assault

Services at Pitt.

Increased drinking leads to other prob-
lems such as sexual assaults and diseases,
according to the report.

It states:

-Ninety percent of campus rapes occur
when the victim, the assailant or both use
alcohol.

°Sixty percent of college women who
contract sexually transmitted diseases are
drunk when infected.

“I think that many women are strug-
gling with internal and external pres-
sures,” Ruiz said.

“Women are socially conditioned to
take care of everyone else, the energy

they have left for themselves isn’t very
much,” Ruiz said. “[Women] are using
[alcohol] to cope.”

The report states that white college
males average nine drinks a week, twice
that of white women. Latino men average
5.8 drinks a week, black men 3.6 drinks
and black women one drink.

And things are probably not going to
get any better very soon, according to
Robert Gallagher, director of Pitt’s
Counseling and Student Development
Center.

“I would guess that in another 10 years
that gap [between men and women drink-

NSABP studies resume recruitment

 

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

Three cancer treatment
studies for early and
advanced breast cancer and
early rectal cancer under the
Pitt—based National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project resumed patient
recruitment last week.

As well as the treatment
studies, NSABP’s Breast
Cancer Prevention Trial has
also resumed conducting risk
assessments for women who
want to enroll in this study,
according to the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center’s
News Bureau. This study
determines whether the drug
tamoxifen can prevent breast
cancer in women who are at
an increased risk of getting
the disease.

The admittance of patients
into these studies was
stopped April 4 by the

National Cancer Institute
because of reports of research
fraud by a Canadian investi-
gator at St. Luc’s Hospital in
Montreal.

“We are pleased to start
entering patients again on
these, important trials,” said
Dr. Ronald B. Herberman,
interim chair of the NSABP.
“This move clearly sends the
message that the NSABP is
working again and can pursue
its ongoing mission which is
to learn how we may be able
to prevent breast cancer and
to advance the treatment of
people with breast or bowel
cancer. Many steps have been
taken to ensure the high
quality of the studies and the
validity of the information
collected.”

According to Kara Smigel,
a spokesperson for the
NCI which funds the NSABP,
recruitment for the studies
will be resumed at most cen-

are not able to begin recruit-

“The National Cancer
Institute is encouraged that
NSABP clinical trials can be
reopened. The steps taken
at NSABP and the institute
have strengthened monitoring

dures. In a larger context,
the cooperative group trials

been scheduled as an informa-
tion—gathering test case.

Harmon said use of the
building for wedding recep-
tions would provide a “stopgap
measure  to enhance the
ﬁnancial coffers of the union.”

Administrators, however, are
unsure whether students would
be allowed to fill those coffers,
Harmon said. But at this point,
Harmon emphasized that no
decision has been made as to
who would be eligible to file
for a reception.

Director of Student
Activities Joseph Cavalla said
his office is drafting the pro-
posal and will provide Harmon
with a recommendation, which
may or may not favor future
receptions, and will receive
additional consideration at a
higher level.

Cavalla said with his past

experience as director of stu-
dent activities at Rider College
in New Jersey, where campus
wedding receptions are pennit-
ted, he has seen how demand-
ing receptions can be for a uni-
versity.

“I’ve seen weddings work on
campus. And to me, unless you
really know what you’re get-
ting into, don’t get into it,”
Cavalla said.

By allowing receptions,
Harmon said, the union may
acquire revenue which could
make the building more self-
supportive. He said mainte-
nance and renovations are not
generally covered by state sub-
sidies and wedding fees could
be used to help cover those
expenses.

But, according to Cavalla,
Pitt may be overstepping the
purpose of a student union by

Casey said he knew going into
the operation that the odds were
against him and without Starzl
the operation and recovery
would never have taken place.

“I had to meet this remarkable
person at the time I met him, in
an institution like this, which is
without a doubt one of the finest
in the world for what I needed at
that particular time,” said a
teary—eyed Casey.

Remembering what Starzl said
to him before surgery, Casey

said he was told to prepare for
the biggest fight of his life, one
that he would win.

Casey credited State Treasurer
Katherine Baker Knoll, who was
also in the crowd, for getting
him in touch with Starzl.

“I think it’s fair to say that had
not Kathy Baker Knoll 
brought me Dr. Starzl’s book
and called me" twice to remind
me that I had the book  shortly
prior to surgery it would never
have occurred,” Casey said.

“I said ‘Don’t give up, you’ve

got to talk to this man. [Starzl’s]
a real miracle worker,”’ Knoll
said, referring to a conversation
she had with the governor.

Commenting on the spring he
wasn’t supposed to live to see,
Casey said the grass looks a little
greener and the ﬂowers appear a
little brighter.

“When I came here I really
had no hope, and now one year
later I have tremendous hope,”
Casey said. “I can look forward
to a future which one year ago
was not within my reach.”

Gallagher said.

Rev. Edward Malloy, chair of the 16-
member commission that produced the
report and president of the University of
Notre Dame, told the media the panel rec-
ommended that colleges offer prevention
and treatment programs, sponsor alcohol-
free events and involve faculty, parents
and alumni to fight alcohol abuse.

The study contains new research but
most of its data and conclusions were

from existing reports, including studies
conducted by the U.S. Department of
Education and Harvard University:
-Fifty-four percent of college men and 38
percent of college women reported going
on drinking binges —— five or more drinks
at One time —— in the last two weeks.
°Members living at fraternities or sorori-
ties average 15 drinks a week, three times
the rate of other students.

°Ninety—five percent of violent crimes and
53 percent of injuries on campus are alco-
hol-related.

°A1cohol was a factor in about 41 percent
of all academic problems and 28 percent
of students dropping out.

°Students with “A” averages in their stud-
ies averaged 3.6 drinks a week; those with
“D” or “F” averages had 10.6 a week.
College students spend $5.5 billion on
alcohol each year.

“If women are going to drink they are
going to be more vulnerable to sexual
assaults and diseases,” Ruiz said. “That’s
why we should do whatever we can to
help this problem.”

using the building for wedding
receptions.

“What are we here for?”
Cavalla asked. “We’re here to
provide space and services for
students, faculty and staff. Are
wedding receptions one of
those? Right now it’s a little
low on my priority [list],”
Cavalla said.

Another
would be the appropriate fee
to charge prospective recep-
tion parties, Harmon said.
However, neither Harmon nor
Cavalla said they were able to
speculate.

For the proposal to pass,
Cavalla said, “We would have
to make a lot of money and it
[could] not  interfere with
the day-to~day, normal opera-
tion of the William Pitt Union,
the functions that we’re here
for.”

Cavalla said he will give
Harmon his recommendation
for or against a wedding
reception policy by the end of
the summer.

The wedding bells to”

T hesound of wedding bells may soon be chiming regularly
throughout the William Pitt Union.

On June 25, Pitt has scheduled the use of the William Pitt
Union for the wedding reception of the daughter of Associate
Vice Chancellor for Business John DeVitto.

Those same bells, however, may be tolling the death knell of

' a current policy which prohibits the use of the union for wed-

ding receptions.

Perhaps it is just a coincidence that the administration
has begun discussing the possiblilty of doing away with
that policy. This discussion may lead to the birth of a new pol-
icy allowing receptions to be held in the union during the sum-
mer and winter breaks, when the use of the union is at a mini-
mum.

University officials have taken vows that the DeVitto recep-
tion is nothing more than a first date, and no commitment has
been made.

The idea of wedding receptions being held at the university
is a good one. It could add a little money to the William Pitt
Union’s checkbook.

The fact remains, however, that the idea had never even got-
ten a second thought until a top university offical had the idea
to break a university policy to accommodate himself.

One has to wonder how the university would have reacted if
a similar request had been made by an alumnus or a current
student of the university.

Although no definite long-term relationship is in the
works to allow receptions to be held in the union, the adminis-
tration has already stated it is unsure as to whether stu-
dents would even be allowed to hold receptions if the idea
ﬂies.

If the university decides it would be able to commit to a last-
ing rule of holding wedding receptions in the union, students
and alumni of this university should be given first priority
when scheduling receptions.

Faculty and staff are paid for their services to this university.

The students and the alumni are the people who have paid
tuition and for whom the building was designated.

The administration and faculty should take a back seat to
students and alumni when it comes to use of the William Pitt
Union.

Would anybody ever consider letting a student use the
Faculty Club for an event?

What do they expect from us?

re you feeling a little
stressed out today? Are
these same old lines

ringing in your ears: “Sell your-
self, be ambitious, get ahead,”
or “Be different, be hip, get
drunk”? Pressures are being put
on us all the time, but some-
times it’s like being shot at from
both sides. What do they all
want from us anyway?

College should be a time
when a person finds his or her
place in the world, not necessar-
ily relative to another person’s
place.

It should be the start of under- 8

standing the world we live in,
not just how others would have

after four years or so of college,
how many of us actual-
ly have any clue about
what the hell is going

thing can lead to self-destruc-

called “The Bongmeister,” you
may be serenaded by a disgrun-
tled customer, “Yo, ‘minimum
wage,’ there’s a ﬂy in my burg-
er!” The point I’m getting at is
that not everyone is as fortunate
as us to have an opportunity to
get an education and many stu-
dents out there are just fooling
themselves. '

Of course, there are those pro-
fessors whose job is to mold
you into fine, obedient capital-
ists. You know the jive, “Greed
is good,” “Take the world by
storm,” Go, go, go; blah, blah,
blah.” They’ll teach you to be a
good capitalist, but not how to

to survive. So here we are, each
of us doing our own thing, basi-
cally on our own. Unless you’re
lucky, there seems to be no
other way. The irony of it all is
that no matter how hard we
work, or no matter how hard we
don’t work, in the end we may
all find ourselves in the same

right? Does it all need to be

Wednesday, June 15, 1994

In recent months, rock ‘n’
roll kids have started showing
an interest in the music of their
parents. You would think most
kids would rather tell their
elders off than be caught lis-
tening to their records. But the
popularity of Tony Bennett
and Frank Sinatra with the
MTV crowd has shown other-
wise.

Which can only mean one
thing: our folks knew how to
swing when they were our age.
(Well  I don’t know about
you, but I first heard Gerry
Mulligan and Chet Baker after
raiding my old man’s record
collection.)

Now a New York sextet is
taking that concept even fur-
ther, showing that not only our
parents but also our_grandpar-
ents and great-grandparents
listened to some pretty hip
music.

The Klezmatics play a style
of traditional East-European
Jewish music called klezmer.
The music has been described
as Jewish jazz as well as
Yiddish/world beat. The sound
of this festive music has the
spirit that can appeal to your
grandmother — whether she’s

New York's Jewish funksters, The Klezmatics come to town.

Jewish or a goy -— as well as a
fan of downtown New York
music’. This Thursday the
group "will perform downtown
at the Three Rivers Arts
Festival.

The music on Rhythm and
Jews, the Klezmatics’ debut
album, merges traditional
folkisms with boppish
rhythms. All but two of the 15
pieces are traditional tunes.
But none of them show their
age.
“ i Sapozhkelekh” juxta-
poses a minor Eastern melody
with a blues back beat.
“Araber Tants” features some
hot clarinet blowing as well as
a violin interlude that sounds
like Rahsaan Roland Kirk’s
vocal-ﬂute playing.

What makes the Klezmatics

interesting is the fact that the
group doesn’t try to present
their music in a modern con-
text to help listeners appreciate
it. The only modern thing on
Rhythm and Jews besides the
electric keyboard (which
thankfully doesn’t mar any of
the music), is the liner notes,
which feature stream—of-con-
sciousness prose and explains
the music’s New York setting.
The connection between tra-
ditional Jewish music and bop
has been crossed before. Jazz
drummer Shelly Manne
recorded an album of Yiddish
songs, and Charlie Parker’s
quintet allegedly played a bar
mitzvah reception, if the film
Bird can be believed. More
recently, Don Byron, an
African—American clarinetist

who just came to town yester-
day, has devoted a good deal
of effort to playing klezmer.
The Klezmatics came
together in New York’s Lower
East Side in 1986. Since then
they have played sold-out
shows in South America and
Europe as well as appearing in
Peter Gabriel’s WOMAD fes-
tival. Recently the group
recorded a klezmer version of
the Nickelodeon children’s
television network jingle.
While each of the band’s six
members are well versed in
klezmer, each one has been
involved in several types of
music. Drummer David Licht
has played with several bands
on the Shimmy-Disc label,
including Bongwater and
When People Were Shorter

\\\\ -. , . 

=:=-;:;;;<. '

 

And Lived Near the Water : s
well as on the solo work of
Kramer. He and Kramer also
played in the rock de-construc-
tionist band Shockabilly.

Trumpeter Frank Morgan
recorded and performed with
everyone from They Might Be
Giants to jazz man Lester
Bowie.

The Klezmatics’ perfor-
mance gives you a perfect rea-
son to go to the Arts Festival
with your folks. Take them to
the show and show them that
you’Ve got culture, more cul-
ture than they thought.

They’d like that.

Thursday, June16 the
Klezmatics perform at 7:30
PM on the Main Stage in Point
State Park.

Teenager of the Year
Frank Black
Elektra

Always the man to rally under the banner of
absurdity, Frank Black returns to the pedestal of
pointlessness with his gratifying second solo
album, Teenager of the Year, which may have been
more aptly titled Inane Lyrics of the Year. But play-
ing the role of a twisted Goofy is part of Frank
Black’s cotton-candy appeal.

Although silly, Frank’s no clown. With these 22
new tracks FB proves he is much more of a stu-

 

dious musician trying to perfect his own peculiar
brand of pop. Like his self-titled solo debut, this
collection displays an enormous breadth of musical
styles, inﬂuences, tones and tempos. His latest col-
lection is a smorgasbord of sounds; from twangy
surfing solos to simplistic Ramones-ish punk, reg-
gae to ‘carnivalesque pomp, dummy hardcore and

then back to more foot-tapping instrumentals,
Frank shows off his ability to maintain continuity
and order amidst diversity.

A few songs, however, delve into weak, misdi-
rected melodies. “Fazer Eyes” stands out as a glar-
ing example of an experimental FB gone too far.
It’s a gut—wrenching experience listening to Frank-

free / When you’ve got your fazer eyes on me.” It
sounds as bad as it reads. Didn’t Richard Marx or
some other crooning twerp go top-l0 with “Angel
Eyes?” Ugh, Frank! Maybe you’ll get some bonus
points for trying to be sentimental. ,
Thankfully, the songs that miss are minimal —
three to four at the most — and the well paced col-
lection moves into whimsical songs like “Pure
Denizen of the Citizens Band” and more upbeat
terrain that seasoned Frank fans will appreciate.
Teenager blasts off with the guitar laden, distort-
ed “Whatever Happened to Pong” and continues
with the frantic “Thalassocracy,” a minute and a
half song displaying the strained Brillo-pad vocals
Black perfected on the Pixies’ Trampe Le Monde.

“The Hostess with the Mostest,” “Superabound,”
“Freedom Rock” and “Pie in the Sky” are all damn
good tracks with the same visceral energy found on
his last album.

Like every FB project, Pixies or no, Frank throws
in his obligatory songs of celestial pondering, sci-
entific intrigue and engineering marvel. “The
Vanishing Spies,” combines a lulling synthesizer

with gentle, spacey lyrics like “Give me one little _

blip/ and I’ll totally flip/ Say it’s nothing but sky/
And I will be one lonely guy,” for nice, slow—tempo
UFOs-amidst-the-constellations imagery. The more
heady, abstract songs are effective because they
give Teenager a diversity allowing for endless,
good mood entertainment.

With Teenager of the Year, Black delivers a
strong, offbeat collection. But for all of its merits,
the catchy set will, unfortunately (fortunately?),
remain in relative obscurity compared to the lolla-
commercial success of the Breeders —— Kim Deal’s
adventure following the Pixies’ breakup. While

Teenager may require some warming up to, and
may not have the same shake-your-hips, bang-
your-head and come-hum-along quality as his
debut, it is an entirely accessible, fascinating com-
pilation of unique ditties.

 - ' Conference.
Columnist A Red Storm
Jack Becker to be precise.

St. John’s University changed
its nickname last week. The uni-
versity’s athletic teams will
hereby be referred to as the Red
Storm.

St. J ohn’s obviously is react-
ing to outcrying from Native
Americans that names like
“Redmen” are offensive; of
course in doing so quickly cor-
recting all the injustices
wrought upon that group of
people throughout their history.

“While sentiment may be
against us changing our name, if
even one person is at all offend-
ed by the name ‘Redmen,’ then
we must make the change,” for-
mer basketball coach Lou
Camesecca said.

How token.

The contention of Native
Americans is that references to
their culture used as sports nick-
names are inappropriate, offen-

   

. sive and groups them with non-

human entities like [Nittany]
Lions and Tigers and Bears (Oh
my!) This contention is a little
difficult to fathom and it
appears St. John’s has been vic-
timized by a wave of political
correctness.

It has become popular in this
country to rid the English lan-
guage of insensitive words.
There are valid points to this
movement, but where does it
say that every person’s inalien-
able rights are life, liberty and
the pursuit of sensitivity?

It would be nice to score the
Native Americans’ complaints
onto the valid side of the battle
but the validity is difficult to
ﬁnd. .

A quick glance through
NCAA division I nicknames
reveals a few common goals in
the naming. Most sports teams
named themselves after things
that either were intimidating,
courageous, honorable or
loaded with some sort of local
ﬂavor.

Twelve other division I
schools may face the same fate
as St. John’s, having names that
indicate Native American cul-
ture. They are: Illinois, Florida
St., San Diego St., Arkansas St.,
Bradley, \V1lliam and Mary,
Southeast Missouri, Miami of
Ohio, Central Michigan,

Swim team catches star cast of recruits

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

Pitt men’s swimming and
diving head coach Chuck
Knoles has lured three top
swimmers to his program for
this fall.

The trio includes Eric
Stefanski, Michael McQueen
and Steve Lewter, whom
Knoles calls “the most talented
group we have brought to Pitt
since I came here in 1990.

“The amount of talent that...

we have been able to sign for
the upcoming year will allow
us to stay competitive in the
Big East, while advancing the
team on the national level as
well,” Knoles said. “We are

bringing into Pitt this next year

enough talent to catapult us
forward toward ourigoals of
moving into the Top 20 and
eventually the Top 15 in col-
lege swimming.” -

Stefanski,

a backstroke
sprinter, is the prize catch of.

“Pitt offered him the oppor-
tunity to join a program that is
quickly developing,” Knoles
said. Stefanski is also interest-
ed in the quality medical facili-
ties that Pitt offers, Knoles
added.

Knoles’ prize recruit is from

fied for the

Crocker said.

Knoles sees him as a versa-
tile addition to the team, who
could fill several roles immedi-
ately. “He has a wide variety of
talents,” Knoles said.

Knoles even went as far as
‘Georgia to land Steve
Lewter, whom he pro-
jects to be one of the
teams sprint-ﬂiers and
freestylers. Lewter was
a finalist at the Spring
1994 Junior Nationals
where he was able to
swim a time of 50.37
seconds in the 100 but-
terﬂy.

Lewter’s club team
coach, Chris Davis, says
Lewter is up to the chal-
lenge of being a
Panther.

“Steve is extremely

The grip that college teams have on their
loyal fans is always evident at the championship
level.

It can hardly be argued that the NCAA bas-
ketball tournament, the hockey final four and
the New Year’s Day bowl games pack ten times
the excitement of their pro counterparts.

But perhaps no single event, in the college or
pro spectrums, offers the pageantry of
the College World Series.

For one week every summer, the
normally quiet town of Omaha, Neb.
turns itself inside out, and becomes the mecca
of the baseball world. People from all walks of
life and from all over the country flock to
Omaha’s Rosenblatt Stadium for college base-
ball’s greatest spectacle.

Never is a seat to be found within the con-
fines of Rosenblatt as thousands upon thou-
sands of baseball fans — many rooting for a par-

’ ticular team, and just as many who simply enjoy
the festivities — watch eight teams battle it out
for the right to call themselves national champi-
ons.

Perhaps the most amazing part of this gala
spectacle is the fact that each of the eight teams
competing for the College World Series crown
is made up almost entirely of names and faces
that nobody, outside of their respective schools,
has ever heard of.

Still, the fans keep coming year after year in
the hopes that they will catch a glimpse of one
of tomorrow’s stars in the making. The CWS
has definitely seen its share of superstar talent

past editions, did not disappoint in giving the
fans and a national audience their money’s
worth. -

The field for the ‘94 CWS, consisting of
Miami (Fla.), Arizona State, Cal State-
Fullerton, Georgia Tech (who dispensed of Big
East Tournament champion Connecticut in the
regionals), Florida State, LSU, Oklahoma and
Auburn provided several exciting
moments and individual stars.

Perhaps the brightest star of all
was shining in a Georgia Tech uni-
form — Yellow Jacket starting catcher Jason
Veratek.

Veratek was undoubtedly the most exciting
player to watch during the College World
Series, dominating at the plate as well as behind
it. While ripping apart opposing pitchers with a
bat in his hand, Veratek was rifling down
would-be base stealers seemingly at will.

In a winners-bracket game against Florida
State, Veratek threw out nearly every runner
attempting to steal, including one snag in the
bottom of the ninth that sent the contest into
extra innings. The Jackets would go on to score
eight in the top of the 10th to give the
Seminoles their first loss of the tournament.

In the end, however, Veratek and his Georgia
Tech mates could not stop the Oklahoma
Sooners, who defeated Tech in the champi-
onship game, 13-5, to win their first College
World Series title in 43 years and the second in
school history.

For all its wondrous qualities, however, the

Construction
begins on
new locker
rooms at

Trees Hall

By Vicki Geubtner
For The Pitt News

Pitt football is anxiously
awaiting its $19 million
“Second Century” face-lift
while the men’s and women’s
swim teams are merely having
a few walls knocked down in a
much-needed improvement at
Trees Pool.

“[The] two programs have
20 Big East Championships
between them, yet one doesn’I
have its own team room and
the other is divided in two,”
said men’s head coach Chuck
Knoles.

Knoles said one of the first
ideas he approached the
administration with when he
arrived four years ago was the
need to renovate the inadequa-
cy and inequality of the two
locker rooms.

Only now that funds are
available is something being
done about it.

Carol Sprague, associate ath-
letic director, said, “I’ve seen it
as a problem for a number of

World Cup brings world's game

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

The start of the world's most
anticipated sporting event is set
to take place in just nine days.

Beginning on June 17 and
ending July 17, this event will
take place in nine U.S. cities,
involve 24 nations playing a
total of 52 games, and will be
viewed by an estimated 2 bil-
lion-plus worldwide.

Most likely you did not guess
the event was the champi-
onship round of the World Cup
Soccer Tournament, but if you
did then count yourself among
the mere 20 percent of
American adults who could do
so, as a Harris poll taken in
February states.

Pitt Head Soccer Coach Joe
Luxbacher said that he thinks
the tournament will expose
people to top-level soccer. “It is
more than people just running
around kicking a ball,” he said.

This is the ﬁrst time the tour-
nament will be played in
America, and many people
don’t share Luxbacher’s opti-
mism. Many people feel the
U.S. is not the most deserving
host country.

However, when the
Federacion Internationale de
Football Association, better
known in its abbreviated form
of FIFA, awarded the U.S. the
rights to the World Cup for this
summer, many feel it did so
with the sole intention of bol-
stering the sport’s popularity
here in America.

America is just an average
coumtry in the soccer world.

However, with America’s
enthusiasm for sports and the
sheer size of the country, all the
ingredients are present to cre-
ate the type of frenzy the rest
of the world holds for this
event.

According to Luxbacher,
over 40 of the 52 possible
games have sold out and an
estimated 3.6 million tickets
have been sold, which is the
most in the toumament’s histo-
ry.

He also said that soccer is
second only to basketball in
terms of numbers of partici-
pants, and that over 16 million
kids under the age of 19 play
soccer.

Sponsors have jumped all
over the opportunity to sell
their goods on an international
level. Forget about targeting an
audience — we are talking
about billions of people.

Two of the major advertisers
of World Cup ‘94 are
McDonald’s and General
Motors, both of whom are
expected to spend between an
estimated $18 to $25 million to
secure global rights to the
World Cup logo. Other compa-
nies like Mastercard haveiniti-
ated special programs linked to
the tournament. Companies are
also spending big bucks to
have their names printed on the
walls of the various stadiums.
As reported in Adweek, by
October 1993, advertising.fees
had already totaled $350 mil-

lion.

Super Bowl XXVIII and the
Winter Olympics are two of the
other major sporting events
that took place this year and
were seen internationally.
When you add the World Cup
to the list, 1994 should be a
record breaking year for spon-
sorship spending. Luxbacher
said the World Cup will be
viewed by more people than
the Winter and Summer
Olympics combined.

In a different style than we
are used to, the games will be
seen without commercial inter-
ruption. Commercials (which
are costing mega-bucks) will
be aired during pregame, half-
time and post-game segments.
Don’t feel bad for the sponsors,
because even though the games
will be commercial-free, logos
will be superimposed on the
screen during the games.

Chicago is where everything
kicks off, and things will con-
clude in Los Angeles at the
Rose Bowl, where the next
world champion will earn brag-
ging rights until 1998. In
between the tournament will
also make stops at the
Meadowlands in East
Rutherford, N.J., Orlando, San
Francisco, Detroit, Washington
D.C., Boston and Dallas.

The Silverdome in Pontiac, _

Mich. will be the site of the
tournament’s first indoor
match. The astroturf at the
dome will be covered with a

new portable sod. Detroit is

years.”

When the administration
reviewed their programs they
felt there was a need to
“improve the women’s locker
room in general and also to
create an equitable situation,”
Sprague said.

Recalling her own experi-
ences as a coach and recre-
ational swimmer at Trees Pool,
Sprague remembers'the rusted
lockers and overall neglect of
the women’s locker room and
stressed the importance of giv-
ing the athletes a “sense of
home and oneness.”

In the past the women’s
locker room was open to all
faculty and recreational swim-
mers, meaning the women’s
team shared a room with the
general public while the men
had their own room. And
the men’s locker room was
divided by a wall that, accord-
ing to Knoles, hindered team
unity.

Women’s head coach Marian
Cassidy feels the new team
room will not only help team
unity, but also “give them their
own identity and a sense of
pride for their own area.”

Cassidy credits the improve-
ments as a combination of
“good timing,” in terms of

available money and also as an
“attempt to come into compli-
ance with treating men’s and
women’s sports equally.”

Knoles believes the renova-
tions are not only an “impor-
tant Title IX issue [a federal
law that outlaws gender dis-
crimination in institutions that
receive federal funding], but
more importantly an athletic
issue.”

“It heightens the importance
of the issue between men’s
and women’s sports,” Knoles
said.

He added that both issues
and the need for “all our facili-
ties to be updated,” made the
decision easy for the adminis-
tration.

Sprague agreed with Knoles’
comment and added, “It will
help to bring our locker room
facilities up to other universi-
ties against whom we recruit.”

Trees Hall is also currently
having a handicap ramp built
for easy access into the build-
ing.

Some preliminary plans for
future improvements across
the street from Trees at
Fitzgerald Field House include
new weight room machines
and new offices for the varsity
coaches.

country automatically qualiﬁes

for the ﬁnal round.

One precautionary measure
that FIFA has instituted is bar-
coded identiﬁcation cards that
all the players, coaches, offi-
cials, reporters, VIPs and vol-
unteers will receive.

In Europe, many of the stadi-
ums have a fence or a mote
surrounding the ﬁeld, in order
to prevent spectators from get-
ting onto the ﬁeld. That type of
set-up in America is extremely
uncommon, not to mention
costly.

John Thompson of CIGNA
says first-come, first-serve
seating has generated some of
the crowd-control problems in
European soccer stadiums.

Naturally all of this does not
begin to consider any of the
numerous professional sports
teams similarly “burdened.”

The folks at these schools

apparently see the nicknames as

a source of pride. Native
Americans should too.

The complaints of Native
Americans might even hold
water if names like Redmen
were the only human ones in a
mix of non-human names. But
that is not the case.

Purdue has the Boilermakers,
West Virginia has the
Mountaineers, Notre Dame has

openly offensive name itself,

even refer to themselves as that
