Scully spoke’ ﬁrst and said their mis-
sion was twofold, to interest college
men indeﬁnite social work and to
bring college men in touch with their
duties in ‘solxring the economic and
political problems of to-day." The
Whole situation is brought to“ your
notice when you see a child, living in
a cellar in a tenement hous,e,_ hungry,
ill clad, near the lower things in life.
There are- problems of pure food,
sweat. shops, housing, taxation, edu-
cation‘ and.r‘ecreati‘on. P A
The speaker said:

meet these problems and to solve
them. You owe it to your University
and to your school in this University,
and to these llnited States irl."‘iivhich
you live to tackle these questions and
settle them. They must either be
solved byyou or they will be solved
for you. Evolution or revolution. Let
us meet them like men.”_ 5
Mr. Ewing, speaking last, summed
up his whole speech when he said :6’
“We give college men the oppor-
tunity; we place them'wit‘h the work,
and our Wonk is done. We need you
men to be leaders.” ,
In response to Dr. Crafer’s' question
as to social service as one life work,
the speakers explained that a new
profession has been born and it is the
noblest calling any ‘man can enter.

7'P.i.tt’s schedttlei will be a matter. of G

hiuory.— Whether the championship

 

‘  togethe-r,..£el1orws! ~ _'

of Western Piennisylvania .is to rernain,
at "Pitt, or whether‘ it" will be trans-
ferred to the abode of the Red and
Black will have been settled. ' '

We have faith that the Blue and
Gold will again be returned the win-
I_1er in -the crucial game of‘ the year,
and,_moreover,—we can give reason’ for
our faith in‘ the rapid development ‘of
our team during the past three weeks.

,But whetherwwel ‘win, or whetheriwe

are defeat-ed, the ‘game is sure to ‘be a
ton & Jeﬁersonrhas a good team, the

nying this fact, d they will put
forth every elfor to land the game.
On the other hand Pitt has just about
‘rounded into shape, after a poor start,
and the prodegies of “Joe” Thompson
feel conﬁdent they will spring a few
surprises on-the Vifashington aggre-
gation. " - « '

One of thegreatest factors in the
game will lie the cheering -of the fol-
lowers of the two teams.’ Under the
able leadership of “Dick” Johnson and
his assistants, Pitt should be able to
surpass _the work of -the  & J. con,-
tingent. Let every student of_»t'he Uni’-
versity stick_ by the cheerleader; get
in on every cheer, and no matter
which way the_ pattle go-es, remain in

_ SALE or BOOKS ,1
VV'hy are the student activity books
not selling as they should?_’ This is a_
question, which the Pitt Weekly
thinks should be answered in large

part bf-the managers of the various
organizations.-' So far, as ,can be as-
certainedi there has beenli no syste-
matic, campaignpin behalf of.the stu-
dent activity books—one of_the best
bargains ever offered to the students,
alumni and friends offthe University.
There-. seems to be a very loose
method in the distribution and sale of
books. So many ‘have beenprinted, a
few have been sold, and the rest seem
to be d_ecaying in the possession gf
people that ought to be selling them.

If there :is a ‘tendency among the
managers of the organizations repre-
sented in thegsttident activity books
to push the. sale of subscriptions or
tiekets?for their own {individual organ-
ization to the detriment of the -student

ganization gets a ‘few cents‘ more per
‘sale’. they are pursuing g “foolish
method. Such a method will not make
money in the long run. .

We suggest that the managers of
the various ‘organizations get together
and make the”sale of these books what
it ought" to _be. By a ‘little. co—opera-
tion there can be much good accom-
plished ‘and the students and the Uni-
.-ve‘rsity as a whole will be greatly ben-
eﬁted.‘ We are sure that all ‘the man-
agers have the interest -of the Uni-

 , versitjygat heart... and that they want

to do what is..best for the students,
but for. some reason have ‘not worked
out ‘a gonoidi “system for the.‘-sale 'of’;t-he

oU'R ADGVERTICSERS *

The average student does not often
stop to consider "the value of adver-
tising’ to the. University ‘paper, or any
other pape_r for that mat_ter. The cost
of production ofany paper is never
met by tho.re\.I€_t11u,e that comes in
from circulation, and it becomes "of
great importance, therefore, that a
paper carry a good amount of adver-
tising in order that ‘it may be pub-
lished without a deﬁcit. i

As regards the advertiser, he is not
going to place an‘ add in a paper sim-
ply for the sake of seeing his name
iii print. He puts his ad in the paper
to getsomething in ‘réturn in trade.
This is only natural, as it-is afmatter
of good business policy to make the
best possible out of all the ads that
are placed in any paper.

Sowhen, the business manager. of
a. university publication approaches a
business man for an add in the paper,
the man asks him: What is to be de-
rived from placing an f add in your
paper? The answer to the question
is not up to the. business manager,
but it is up to the students that take
the paper. Every time that you pur-
chase some thing at the store of a
man that advertises in the Pitt rVVeek-
ly say to him: “I saw your ad in the
Pitt Weekly.” ltiwillgtake little ef-
fort on your part and will help your
university journal to a wonderful ex-
tent. , — H .
Read the paper carefully and pat-
ronize the "people that put their ads
in the University publication. .

Did some one say that a poor, start

is a sign or a glorious ﬁnish. Let us
hope so for-t'h'e Pitt football season‘.

ARMY-INDIAN GAME ROUGH  

While the I contests between‘ the .

Army and Indian teams are usually
very rough, the one la‘st'Saturday was

probably the /worst in this respect

that was ever played between the two
elevens.‘ Bad blood seems to last over
from year to year and the opposing
players into the game prepared to

use any -sort of tactics to win. The’

Army team seemed particularly anx-
ious to put Capt; Jim Thorpe out of
the game this year and all but suc-
ceeded ashe was knocked completely
out twice and required time out sev-
eral other times. Every time he was
‘hurt, however, ‘the mighty halfback
regained his feet and went ing the
men that weretrying to_ “get him”
with redoubled iuty.‘ He smashed the
Army line and dashed around their
ends with seemingly-as great ease as
he did in Pittsburgh some weeks ago
and was directly responsible formost
of the points annexed-by the Abo-
rigines; C

for slugging which gave the opposi-
tion 'half_‘:he distance to the goal line
and resulted in a touchdown ‘for them.
A little’ later, Capt. Devor-e o-f- the
Army team suffered the same penalty

but the game. was at that time as—~

sured to the;India11s. The Redskins
played the cleanest game of their ca-
reer‘ in Pittsburgh which would lead
one to think that the_Army was chief-
-ly' to blame for the slugging match.
‘The Penr—Mic'higan game was one
of the greatest surprises of‘ the pres-
.ent season as at the end or the first
half the Penn team seemed over-
whelmediwithra score of 21-0 against
them. iTh-en "Western team had scored
almost at will by‘line plunging and

never; the less as the coach of the
school is none ‘other than our’ old‘
friendiand last year’s halfback, “Raz”-y
Quailey. 4“Raz” was mighty. tickled
at the result of the game, as the‘ fresh

Johnstown H. S. and several other
good _ prep. school’ teams and ‘their
defeat at the hands of Q.uailey’s as-

two more games on the schedule.

. - Pitt’s great team in 1910 had a few
-stars, it is true, but their splendid
L record was due to the fact that every

man was -in every play and all worked
in perfect unison. ,

Pitt Scores Early.

Pitt took -the kick-off and rushed
the ball steadily toward,M.aryland’s
goal line, where VVagner scored from
the V3-yard line. on a buck through
tackle. Smith kicked goal. Pitt re-
ceived the next kickoff and consistent
gains by Dillon, VVagner and VVard
carried the ball to the 20-yard line,
where Wagner scored on an end run.
Maryland got the oval on Pitt’s 35-
yard line when Dillon fumbled the
kickoff, but were unable to gain in

three tries, so altempted-a ﬁeld ‘goal,’

which Pitt blocked with ease. Dillon
gained twenty yards on two tries and
W'agn.er"carried the ball to the 35-
yard ‘line, where Ward tried a field
goal which was a failure. After Pitt
had received a 15-yard penalty for
holding,‘ VVagner raiyaround end for
a touchdown and Smith addeda point
with a goal. ' o i
_ Egbert _went in ‘for Wagner at this
time arid Billy .Mci:11r$'y took S'hof’s

‘ place; The former g.ained25 yards on
 his ﬁrst try and then passed to Joyce

for a 20-yard gain. Dillon carried the
leather overland Smith b;oot_ed it be-
tween the uprights. Justvbefore the
half ended Dillon got away again and
added another score, making a total

' of 33 points for the first half.

Coach Thompson sent his second

. team on in the. third quarter but the

subs were unable to add more points
to _Pitt’_s ‘total so the regulars were

’ sent in .to4linis'h up the good work in

the last -quarter. Pitt got away with
spectacular plays in this
period. Wagner took the kickoff on
Pitt’s ' 10-yard line and dodged

through the entire Maryland team for

a touchdown. On the next kickoff

"ner l.

Dillon decided that he wouldn’t be‘

outdone by. Hube,‘ so he carried the
leather. over -after some artful dodg-
ing. His touchdown didn’t count,
however, as a Pitt man was detectecl
holding while the play was in p'i'og—
A Wagiier also negotiated a ﬁeld
goal from the 30-yard mark and later

passed to Joyce, who scored after a
Z5-ya1_‘d run.‘ ,

SWIMMING INSTRUCTOR
GETTING A LINE
oN PITT’S ABILITY

 

‘ Mr. John T. Taylor, the new di-
rector of swimming at the University;
has had very little opportunity to
judge as tn the ability of the Pitt
swimming candidates. The tank- has
not been in full running order and
but few workouts have been held. But
in discussing the prospects for a
swimming team Mr.’ Taylor said: “I
have beenassisting in the ‘physical
examination and the young men who

have been through my hands have the J
to make a '

necessary qualiﬁcations
team in any branch of sport; This
means that Pitt will have a strong
swimming team. The tank is ideal for
racing and water polo and is equipped
wtih every appliance to instruct be-
ginners, and advanced swimmers. So
it is up to every student who is ‘fond
of aquatics to get thoroughly ac-
quainted with the instructor as soon
as possible. Class competition, a sure
manner of developing speed, will be
inaugurated within the ‘next few
weeks. So read'the swimming" tank
rules and regulations and get in the
swim."

SELECTIONS MADE FOR
' FENCING TEAM
Fencing is now a recognized sport
at the University of Pittsburgh. The
fencing team that will represent the
University was chosen Tuesday night
after a “Round Robin” between those
who were competing for positions on

 

The coming_ season will be a busy
one" for the fencers. Arrangements
are being. made for,-a quadrangular
‘meet between Cornell,¢he Pittsburgh
Athletic Association, the German
Club and Pitt for some time in De-
cember. Negotiations are also pend-
ing with Yale and Princeton. VVith
these and also the local teams there
should be some very -interesting meets‘
arranged for the coming season.

Prof. Postgate, who has been coach-'

ing the fencing association of Pitt for
over a year, chose three members of
the association to compose the team;
A fourth member will be picked some

time after Thanksgiving. Prof. Post-

team bya score of 45-8. We say “the
same team,” but we believe that the
Indian team that beat Pitt so decisive-
ly was ‘at leastjl00 per cent. stronger
than .the one that VV. & J. held to no
score. ,\/Vhile the Indians were put-
ing the_ ﬁnishing touches on Pitt, the
Red and Black team was .being
smothered by Penn State 30-0 in
Center COunty.. This upset all the
dope that had been concocted on the
game as everyone expected a small
score ‘with. perhaps :1 Statevictory;
Since the State game W. & J. has
been beaten by Yale’ 13-3 while Pitt
has come‘ out second best with Navy
and Notre Dame, both being close
and exciting games. NO conclusions

comparison of the‘ teams is‘ all t'hat
can give any infOrma‘tiOn On tO-mor-

With Capt." “Polly” ‘Galvin in. the

and Shof of Pitt are as good as their
Opponents and Pitt’s halfbacks are
about equal with a shade in favor ‘Of
VV. & I. There is only one fullback
and that is VVagner, who will Out-
shine his opponent as " much as a
Mazda lamp -would put a candlein
the shadow. -Patterson is said to be
some drop kicker, but Ward has been
successful this year in booting the
ball and Wagner and Galvinycan be
relied on to score placements. In
Galvin, Wagner and Egbert, Pitt has
three Sterling punters who will aver-’
