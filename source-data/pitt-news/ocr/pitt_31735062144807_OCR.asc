life wi'thVVdelight; in ‘the ‘immediate

to‘ keep thisadelight, ﬁnding it inflater‘

that weV Vbegan.with. as wonder turns

Butnow we understand what causes
snow and while wonder still hangs’
_ around the. ﬂake , it is no longer the

The University of Pittsburgh is one
of the few’ American, schools that
maintains _a tropzéal research station.
While the‘ station at Kartabo isiopen
throughout the year, it is unique in
that during -the summer it becomes Aa-

regular. university classroom, to which
are transferred a se,lect.ed"_group. of
graduate and undergraduate students.

Ideal for research,-the stationis
situated in the heart -of the largest
and least known jungle -area_ in the
world-—thVe Guiana rain fcrests—less
than ﬁve degrees-northyof the equa-‘
tor, at a point _, where‘ two 'migh'ty
rivers meet. A A .

‘It was my pleasure to serve in the
capacity ‘of director of_ the work this

in May for New Orleans, where I met

though, ourship was, badly damaged,
we were able to proceed; We tray.-

by way.of the West Indies, and the
north coast of Venezuela -to George-
town, BVriVtish_Guiaua. Along the yvay
we grappled‘-for. sea_weed. and by
trailing—nets were able to. "collect,

. many marine forms such as Cteno-

phores, pipe ﬁshes, and” mzirine
crustaceans. ~ The "boys enjoyed lean-
ing over the bow and‘ casting har-
poons at porpoises whicl1acco1npan-

and threw cocoanuts at ,a~1ligators.- I
told the boys to stand around’ a palm

V I THE ‘STUDENTS
"Within two weeks’ afterour arrival
theentire party had assembled. It
r3'onsistedfof Dr. Howard E. Enders,
of Purdue University, "as: associate,
‘and twenty students representing ten
American colleges anduniversities.
After the students had-sp-ent several
days in looking around, Vtheychose,
‘or were assigned. prgblenls for study
in‘ addition to_ the regular work.1n
'Ecology. They “soon found that the
jungle was I teeming with life and
that one had only to proceed quietly
to‘ ‘discover .. a‘ multitude: of forms.

we soon h‘ad our cages’ full’ of iguanas,

There were three very remarkable
types of ﬁshes in the rivers, the ar-
mored catﬁsh, the biara, and the
perai.. The armored catﬁsh occasion-
ally left. thejwateriand crawled about
on the mud ﬂats. « The biara had" two
lower tecthso long that they extend-
ed throughlholes in the top of the
head. The deadly pera.i, which is
‘said to attack and kill humans, is
quite capable of biting off ﬁngers and
toes. We always jumped into ‘the
river‘ with a splash and a..,yell to scare-
them away. . ' »

‘Fresh water porpoises played in the
yvaterand all our attempts to harpoonV
or shoot ' them provedfutile. But
luckily one. got caught in a. gill net
and drowned. It was the ﬁrst entire
specimento be brought to the United
States ‘and was presented to the Car-

Another interesting ﬁsh that was
fairly plentiful was .' a catﬁsh, \ the,
skeleton of which so plainly displays
a ‘cruciﬁx that it has received the
name of cruciﬁx ﬁsh. -

THE,_IND‘IANs~ .

The Indians were a curious lot. In
this region there-are three tribes, the’
Arawaks, the Akawais, and ‘tile’
-Caribs, -whose ancestors were the
original‘ South ‘American cannibals.
While they were not always friendly,
they were, never hostile. V They still
wear ‘the savage. dress‘ of head apron
or loin cloth and Vstill“useVthe blow
gun and bow and arrow for hunting.‘
They are -especially adept at shoot-
ing ﬁsll.“.Tl1ey live in thatched huts
and‘._live almost entirely off the jungle.
Some of them laughed at ,_us’ for eat-
ing monkeys, ‘yettheyate grub worms
and ants. - , ‘ .

Ourdiet consisted of all’ kinds of.
monkeys, lizards, agoutis, labas, alli-
fruits and vegeta-

' » LIFE AT KARTABO

The temperature in the; jungle was
‘perhaps not so uncomfortable as‘ it
was here, last summer" and although
it; seldom went below eighty degrees
we often, gold cold at night due to the
dampness.

-sun helmets. The day‘I left George-
town, October 15, the official _record
was 169 degrees. _
Although we were uncomfortable at
times‘ and tired of-our native foods we

[had lots of fun. '1. simply must tell

one ‘on. Dr. Enders, and I hope he will
enjoy itxas we did at the time.

' . Dr. Enders was as enjoyable a com-

panion as one could wish. for and
what. he . doesn't know about Mallo-

pllaga 'i_sn‘t:wort11V knowing.’ He is a‘ 

good pistol shot, too, and as such had
quite a reputation',among,_.tl1e‘ party
for along time. But one‘ day when
we’ were up above the rapids we no-

ticed a troop of-large monkeys in a '

tree ab'out‘_200 feet high. He drew
his -pistol’ and remarked that he
would have baboon for dinner that
night. He was directly under them
and began ﬁring. After shooting six
or seven clips of cartridges hc be
came‘ desperate and ‘running back-
.wards to get another aim, he tumbler‘.
over a ﬁve-foot bank into a stream.
It was amusing to see’ him dying in
the water with pistol npraised‘ and

hopelessly ﬁring away.--We did not I
.'have- baboon for dinner -that night.

‘  another time Dr. Enders and I
lay in thejungle for four -hours wait-
‘ing for jaguars when suddenly we

-heard an‘animal approaching. I had

a shot gun and, he ‘had the ﬂash and
his pistol. We'hadn’t any ‘concep-
tion of what was coming although
we knew from its tread‘ thatit was
not a jaguar. »VW'he_n the light ﬁashe-J
the animal stopped.« It was’ a.__«giant
‘armadillo about as‘ large as a bee
hive! W'e bothwere surprised and
Vdeligllted‘ that -we c‘ouldn’t move..
WhV.enV.it turned Iﬁred but  shot
bounced off itsVshe1l and fell among
the plants like rain. Dr. Enders was
so surprised_.that“lV1‘e did not think of

his pistol and the .thing,‘got: away.

But to-be_ fa~iryI’ll admit that I,_ too,
had quite a,pistVol' onmy belt and I
was so. excited that I CQlll(ll1’t get‘-it
out of the holster. .We both agreed

a,fVterward_s that it was too- bad -we ' I
didn't get it but the‘Vs‘ight°of.that '

‘beast will never leave us.

The summer's experience will mean
a lot to-them and‘ we are‘ hopeful‘th‘at
more students will. have the oppor-
tunity of‘: visiting Kartabo which is
the “Garden of-Eden"’ foruthe. biolo-
gist.  ’ I i . . '
