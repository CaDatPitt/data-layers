University Backs
SG Plan Against

All Discrimination

Dr. John Geise, assistant chan-
cellor of student affairs, an-
nounced recently that the Univer-
sity will support Student Govern-
ment’s refusal to recognize any
campus organization whose con-
stitution contains racial or re-
strictive clauses.

“The University never has had
a formal written policy on the
issue of discrimination,” Geise
said, “because we never have felt
it was necessary, since our posi-
tion has always been quite clear.

.“We do not practice nor tolerate
discrimination at the University.
We have among our student body
members of all races, all religions
and all nationalities.

“The student government now
has indicated to us that it needs
further support in this matter in
order to eliminate discriminat-
ory practices among a few or-
ganizations owned and operated
by students and not under direct
University control. If that is
the case, we will give the Stu.
dent Government whatever sup-
port it needs.”

The student Senate adopted this

policy of refusing recognition to .

groups having discriminatory
practices on Dec. 5, and will put
it into effect January 1, 1966,

It was established that the rea-

censure the administration for
past actions, but to prevent any
possibility of discrimination in the
future. , _
The main part of the Senate
discussion was on possible dis-

several of the statements made

$34 a Credit
Takes Effect

In September,

Tuition charges will be in-
creased by $6 per credit hour for
out-of-state undergraduates, ef-
fective September. 1961, Chan-
cellor Edward H. Litchﬁcld an-
nounced today.

Exempted from the new ruling
of $34 per credit are all under-
graduates of Pennsylvania resi-
dence and all graduate and pro-
fessional students, regardless of
residence.

Pennsylvania students are ex-
empted, according to Dr. .[.itch-
ﬁcld, because “the Commonwealth
traditionally has contributed ﬁnan-
cial support to the major private
universities in Pennsylvania."

“Accordingly, we have decided
to increase tuition for out—of—state
undergraduates as a way of em-
phasizing the ‘basic commitment of
the University of Pittsburgh to its
home region and to Pennsylvania.

“This action seems to us to be
a clear and practical way of
recognizing, in favor of the tax-
payers, our rather special rela-
tionship , to the,‘ Cominon_\vealth
as a state-aided institution."

Dr. Litchﬁeld stated on the ex-
emption of the graduate students
that “the need of both the Com-
monwealth and the nation for
well-trained professional people is
so great that it would be unwise
to apply a comparable tuition in-
crease to graduate and profes-
sional studcnts from outside of the
state.

“Furthermore, many of these
students, unlike out-of—state' un-
dergraduates, take up residence in
Pennsylvania after receiving their
degrees and thus add substantially
‘to the Commonwealth’s trained
manpower resources.”

This tuition increase is the
sixth rise in costs at the Uni-
versity since 1949, the most re-
cent one being in January of this
year. At that time, tuition was
raised from $23 per credit to
$28.

In 1932 tuition was $10 per
credit. This did not change until
1949 when a $1 per credit in-
crease was imposed. Since then,

-1951, $12.50; 1952, $14; 1954, $16;

W(>sley(m Systeriz Puts Stress

On Qzmlily, Liberal Education

By PAT CHERKIN
The Wesleyan College Plan
stresses quality and a liberal edu-
cation, focusing attention on the
individualized and independent
study of the student.
Victor Buttcrtield, president of
 Wesleyan College discussed the
advantages and goals of his
school’s unique plan before the
. Midday Series audience this week.
 “It’s pretty radical, it‘s true,”
 Butterﬁeld said when referring to
 . the Plan, but it should lead to the
 ultimate goal of “capturing the
 ' imagination of many students who,
under the present system, are un-
moved and unchallenged.” .
Butterfield explained that Wes-
leyan College is operating three
independent experimental colleges:
The College of Public Af‘[airs, The
College of Ldtters, and The Col-
lege of. Quanitative Studies. En-
. rolled in those special schoolsarc
.4 115 sophomores, juniors, and sen-
iors, sclccted from the 870 Wes-
leyan men.
Meet in Seminars
’ ‘ Rather than following the con-
ventional prescribed courses and
competing for grades. the men un-
der this plan meet with their
teachers in seminars to discuss the
subjects which they have chosen

 

 

 

 

to study.

According to Butterﬁeld they
are then given an exam , de-
signed to reveal the progress of
their individual studies at the
end of the junior year. A thesis
and comprehensive exams are
required b e f o r e graduation.
These tests are given to them
by outside examiners.

“To what extent the student is
hamstrung by the contlncmcnts of
authority and restricted courses of
study” was the primary question
leading to the development of the
Wesleyan College Plan, Butter-
ficld said.

Learning Emphasized

He feels that under the plan the
student will be more apt to be
considered as a whole person, not
as someone whose knowledge is
divided into parts which are de-
tached from one another.

“Learning for the sake of
knowledge,” Butterﬁeld empha-
sized, “is one of the main prem-
ises for the College Plan. Stu-
dents will have more time to
venture outside of their spe-
cialities,” he added.

V Butterfield noted that the results
of this new program appear to be
favorable, although no deﬁnite
conclusions as to the success of
the College Plan can be made now.

Solid opportunities with solid state devices

A big part of Western Electric’s job is to manu-
facture the miniature "new arts” products that
are changing the science of communications.
It’s a job which offers you a challenging career
—-a chance to plan new methods of mass pro-
ducing ever-improving kinds of transistors, fer-
rite devices, diodes, special purpose electron
tubes, etc.

You'll be with a company that is expanding
rapidly in this field. At present our Allentown
and Laureldule, Pa., plants are devoted exclu-
sively to making electron devices, and a big
new plant is under construction in Kansas
City. The needs of the Bell Telephone System
for these products are increasing daily and
will multiply enormously with the introduc-
tion of Electronic Central Oflice switching
now nearing trial operation.

These devices are changing the scene at all
our mmufacturing plants as they go into the
startling new communications products devel-
oped by our associates at Bell Telephone
Laboratories. From microwave transmission

——-. ap-

equipment to submarine cable ampliﬁers, our
products call for creative production engineer-
ing, installation planning, and merchandising
methods. Our job for the Bell System and the
U.S. government has grown to the point where
we are now one of the nation’s “Top 11" in
industrial sales. And your chance to play an
important part in our future growth is solid!

Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus-
trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. For more

A review of “Alas Babylon” by
Martha Holstein was recently se-
lected by students in English 1
classes as the best book review
submitted for the freshman com-
petition conducted by Dr. Edwin
Peterson and Dr. Abe Laufe.

Each student in English I was
required to submit a book review
for the contest. Recitation teach-
ers in each of 30 groups chose one
8tudent’s book review to submit to
Dr. Peterson and Dr. Laufe, who
then selected the best six.

These six were shown on a
screen in the main lectures, and
students voted for their prefer-
ence. In addition to “Alas Baby-
lon,“ other ﬁnalists were “Kid-
napped,” “Red Badge of Courage,”
“Huckleberry Finn,” “Rain,” andl
“The Portrait of the Artist as a3
Young Man.”

Miss Holstein received Dr. Pc-
terson’s $10 bookshelf as an award
for her theme. This is the first
time that English I classes "have
had such a contest.

_ ' Raising tuition for out-of-state ‘students is a wise move
 many respects, but it seems that the amount of the recent
liiilre isﬂtoo high. ' ‘ I  A   -,
Pittsburghers have. claimed recently that the Uni-
‘ versity, with its planned expansion, of dormitoryi facilities
I and increased tuition, has forgotten the local students, and
has geared its program to attract resident students.

h or This tuition raise is theﬁrst indicationain a long time
that the University recognizes its commitment to local’
students, so from this point of view it Is a sensible decision.

  From aifinancial point of view also, the decision was also
a sound one. Not only will the University get more funds
‘ “from students-, but state senators will be willing to appro-
priate even more funds to the University if they know it
,wi-llge toward providing additional brain power for this
Commonwealth, ratherthan for other states. -

if _. However,’ it is interesting to note that in 1959, state
appropriations paid for less than 15% of a student’s tuition,
according to information released last year by the Univer-
 But’ now, ‘tout-of-state students will. pay over 21%
more than ‘in-state students. So although such a hike was
warranted, ‘it may be higherthan is fair. -0 «

a trade. _ V , _ 7 ’ j

Just ten years ago tuition was $11 per credit. This is
_ the sixth» increase in the last decade, which averages out

By Joanne Dolinarf

It is traditional for the editor of the Pitt News
to write one last column before he graduates, sum-
marizing his experiences at the University. During
my three and a half years as a student here, there

has been one kind of experience that has im- V

pressed me profoundly, and that

about life than anything else in
my college career. I am refer-
ring to my dealings with mem-
bers of the administration, which i ’
has sometimes been pleasant, but
more often unpleasant. ,
Most of the administrators,
from the bottom to the top of .
the complicated hierarchy, have
one characteristic in common:
they lack ethical standards. By

"subtle deceptions they aim to» mislead students and

discourage any initiative thaLa student might-have.
I have had members of the administration tell

me privately that they strongly agreed with a
partieular stand taken by the Pitt News. But when

in the presence of a higher administrator, who
disagreed with the stand, they suddenly changed
their minds and decided that the Pitt’ News was
wrong.

Twisting the Facts 1 c,  ‘ ’

Some shrewd administratorsgyszill willingly dis-
cuss any situation with you, but will twist the fact
to make themselves, or the University look good.
When one attempts‘ to clarify ‘these “facts,” he is
accused of twisting them. I," '

An interesting situation which often arises is
that two different administrators give two different
stories on the same situation.‘;A‘Later, "the two ad-
ministrators- will get together" and decide on a
single story. If they are. fortunate; their original

' statement was ambigious enough that there is little

diﬂiculty in changing its meaning. Otherwise, they
simply claim they never said it, or that they
misunderstood. , ;

Such occurences are quite regular, and they
present problems. for a newspaper which attempts

V

were V

 

to print the facts, for when official sources do not
give the real facts, the newspaper has no where
to turn, unless it wishes to go by “hearsay.”

A Losing Baﬂle _
But there is a further

ministrators learns that battling against them_means
playing the game as they do, not by ones’ own

ethical standards. The student cannot emerge with- ‘

out battle scars, without his own standards lowered,
for in his attempt to get at the truth, he too must
learn to deceive.

Why does_this situation exist at the University?
There seems to be a generalized fear among ad-
ministrators that if they make one wrong move’
they will lose their jobs. Perhaps they have seen

_ dilemma, a more serious _
one. A student who must deal ’ with these ad-

a few too manyiadministrators leave in the past

few years.

So one gets the impression that what is being
done by the administration is not done for the
students, but rather to make administrators “look
good,” to assure themselves that they will keep
their positions, or even better, receive a promotion.
A Rude Awakening I .

The attitude seems to be: “Everything would

be ﬁne around this place if it weren’t for the,

students.” _
For almost four years I have watched this situa-
tion grow worse, until now a student can almost be
assured that any idea he wishes to-put into effect,-
any hope to change existing conditions, will be
‘completely squelched by the _ administration,
through one means or another. ‘ ’ P

Miracle Play by Antiqua Group
Opens Friday in Heinz Chapel

Heinz Chapel will be the scene
of ;‘.‘.The Miracle»P1ay of St. Nich-

olas” Friday and Saturday at 3.

p.m. "presented by the Antigua
Players.
'1‘liis"is the ﬁrst time a dramatic

~ production has been performed in

the Chapel. “Since the play is of a
religious nature, the Chapel. with
its Gothic architecture and stained
glass windows is a perfect back-
ground for it,” commented Colin
Sterne, director of the group. “In
addition, the play was first pre-
sented by the clergy of the Middle
Ages.” _

The story is about a little boy
who is kidnapped by a pagan king
and is restored to his home by a
miracle of St. Nicholas. A nar-
rator will describe the action, and
the iplayerswill sing it in Latin.
The music was used during the
actual Mass on St. Nicholas’ Day,
Dec; 6.

Copied from photostats of the
original script in Orleans, France,
the music has no rhythmical
value. The poetry of the Latin

words had to be scanned to
rhythm patterns. «

The players will use musical in—=

struments of the Middle Ages such
as the Psaltery, Cromorne, Re-
corder, and the Sothic Fiddle.

The Antiqua Players will be
assisted by the Pitt Players and
part of the Heinz Chapel Choir.
The play is under the direction of
Michael McHa1e, director of the
Pitt Players.

 ” Cats Face

Colgate

In Opening Round 9

_ By JIM 0’BRIEN
Athletic Director Frank Carver didn’t exercise much
discrimination when he issued invitations to the 10th Annual
Steel Bowl basketball tournament for the chosen visitors,
Tennessee and Colgate, have both compiled 4-0 records to

boast in the opening rounds.

In addition, Duquesne, the other regular on the twin-

bill, descend from the Bluff with‘

a 4-1 chart. So the poor Pan-
ther, sporting a dismal 1-3
mark, have no “patsies” in C01-
gate in the second match on Fri-
day evening. The ﬁrst game will
start at 7:00

There is nothing to assure _their

-eventual meeting with the Dukes

in the perennial title contest,
which has featured these two
neighborhood schools since 1954.
Dukes Fell

The Bluflites, who entered last
year’s tourney with a 2-0 mark,
were upset in the ﬁnals by an in-
spired Panther ﬁve, which dupli-
cated the feat of 1958 when the

. favored Dukes fell to the Cats

also. ,

This year Coach “Red” Man-
.ning’s team might not reach the
ﬁnals either, for the Colunteers
from the South have their big
guns cocked to knock off “them
damn Yankees.” Tennessee be-
gins its second season under
Coach John Sines, and has’ a
fast start on improving on its
12-11 record of 1959.

Colgate, with six returning vet-
erans, promises a return to win-
ning ways if the team’s offense
can compensate for an inconsist-
ent defense. Bob Duffy, a 21 plus
scorer, and John Doyle return at
guard. Ken Norum, Bill Salisbury
and Mel Watkins open in front;
sophs Jack Brown and Danny
Raabe are reserves. The Red
Raiders posted an 11-12 mark last
season.

Speed and Depth

“Duquesne has the same team
predominantly that they had last
year,” Coach Bob Timmons sigh-
ed, “and they have improved
tremendously. Clyde Arnold (6-5
forward) is the key to their new-
found success. He is the most im-
proved’ player on the team. Ne‘w-
comer Mike Rice has been a big
help too.” .

Coach Manning has speed

DICK FALENSKI

and depth problems, but his ﬁve
“iron men” have been scoring
at a proliﬁc rate of 90 points
a game so far, Ned Twyman, a
foul shot artist, Bob Slobodnik,
Rice, Arnold and Bill Stromple

will most likely get the starting
assignments on Friday.
Timmons is relying on the pride
of his teams to overcome their
mechanical diﬂiculties and turn
the oddmakers’ tidal wave in the
other direction. “The Steel Bowl
has always brought out the best
in a Pitt team,” Timmons stated.
“I am counting on the boys to be
‘up’ for the tournament."

Maloney For Relief

Timmons is expected to go with
leading scorer Dick Falenski, who
is averaging 16.3 points; ‘ Ben
Jinks, John Fridley, Don Stein-
hart, and Paul Lazor.

Tom Maloney, the third lead-
ing shooters with nearly 10
points a game, and Howie
Lockhart will be on call for re-
lief duty. Lou Slabz; and John
Maczuzak, the hefty grid im-
ports, rave been tabbed as
timely solutions to the rebound-
ing problems of the Cats, but
each only collected one in their
ﬁrst outing, playing about 10
and 15 minutes respectively.

One interesting sidelight of the
Army encounter was the zest
with which these two football
players sprawled for loose balls
under the boards. They gave hint
that they were struggling for
fumbles instead. “That will come
in handy,” Timmons smiled. “Pos-
session is 90% of winning basket-
bal glames, and if we can get
the ball by scrappy play, then
we’ll score more.”

“If our rebounding and defense
improves, we
stronger,” he added. “If it doesn’t,
well, it is going to be a cold win-
ter.”

Rex Peery Hopes‘ Guzik Will

Solve‘ Heaveig

‘Mighty Mites’
Best Lightweights
In Country

By TED COLTON

When the Panther matmen
open the 1960 season with
Cornell on January 7 they
will have the best lightweight
wrestlers in the country. The
“Mighty Mites,” Dick Martin,
Larry Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington
and John Zolikoff, will be of little
worry to Cbach Rex Peery.

But after the first four weight
classes Peery will have to scram-
ble to come up with victories.
Peery’s main concern is. the
heavyweight division.

“We have one of the ﬁnest
heavyweight wrestlers in the East
right now if he will only decide
to get in there and do the job,”
commented Peery.

Finished Third

He is speaking of Bob Guzik,
220 pound tackle on the football
team. Last year Guzik ﬁnished
third in the Easterns. He was
beaten by Johnston Oberly of
Penn State. Oberly ended up
Eastern champ but had trouble
beating Guzik. ‘

In their dual meet last year
Oberly and Guzik battled to a
draw but Oberly was awarded
a point for stalling.

While watching Guzik wrestle
with 250 pound Gary Kaltenbach,
another footballer, Peery said,
“This boy should be rarin’ to go.
This will be his chance to make
an athletic name for himself here
at Pitt.

Can Help

“He didn't have a good football
season but now he can redeem
himself by working hard and
setting his mind to wrestling,”
Peery continued. .

“If he wants to he can really
help this team. There aren’t too
main heavyweight wrestlers in
the country that have Bob‘s
ability,” he concluded.

Besides Guzik, Peery will be
expecting a lot from Jim Har-
rison. “Jungle Jim,” as he is call-
ed by his friends, is a rugged
middleweight who will probably
wrestle in the 157 pound class. If
he lives up to expectations the
Panthers may have many of their
dual meets won at the end of the
157 pound match.

Over the holidays the matmen
will participate in the Wilkes-
Barre tournament. The Panthers
will try to regain their title which
they lost last year to the New
York Athletic Club. In ’59 the
Panthers were hurt when Kel-
vington was unable to wrestle
because of an- injury.

Zolikoff and Lauchle were
beaten and will be out to settle
the score this year.

Cat..Rifle Team

Falls to WVU,

Gonsowski’s 284 Tops Locals ,9

An inexperienced Panther riﬂe
team went down to their ﬁfth loss
last Saturday at the hands of pow-
erful West Virginia. Geneva, Car-
negié Tech and the Panthers were
all competing against the Moun-
taineers.

WVU proved to be too strong
for all three teams as they scored
1434 points compared to 1399 for
Tech, 1398 for the Panthers and
1347 for Geneva.

Panther captain, Bob Fleisch-
man was very pleased with the

performance but’not by the Cat
riﬂemen. “For the ﬁrst year of
competition our scores are high,”
he stated.

“Two years ago was the last
time the Panthers had a riﬂe
team and even then a score of
over 1400 was a rarity,” the cap-
tain concluded.

Against West Virginia Chester
Gonsowski was the big gun for
the Panthers. He scored 97. points

from the prone and kneeling po-
sitions but fell off to a 90 from
the standing position. i .
Don Fucci was the only Cat to
shoot a perfect score.
shooting 100 prone, he fell off to
93 kneeling and 90 standing.
His total was 283. '
Fleischman followed with a 279
total. A 98 prone was his best po-
sition, Jerry Yeaney and Bill Mc-
Farland rounded out the Panthers
ﬁve with identical scores of 276.
Both Yeaney and McFarland ﬁred
99’s shooting prone. ' '
The Panthers’ overall record is
now 3-5 with their next match
coming in the new year. '

~Face. Rugged ‘Seven-Meet Schedule ‘ ’ ‘-

7'«"’Gym*nasts Lack Experience

Neiger Tries to
Beat 5-3 Mark

By LARRY HAGGERTY
In its seventh year on the
varsity program,‘ the Panthers’
gymnastic squad will lack
depth and experience. In 1959

.the Jungle Cats had a record

“.9 of three wins andthree losses

a» Penn State and
'3 Temple.

while last season they ended the
campaign with a 5-3 record.

This coming season has the
Panthers facing a rugged seven-
meet schedule, starting off with
Navy, always a
power in East- ‘
ern gym circles.
Following th e
Navy meet the.
Panthers will
clash with such
other power-
houses as Army,

1'

The nucleus
of ‘the’ 19§1  
squad will be Neiger
furnished by four veteran letter-

, men including seniors Joe Ba'ttag-
lia, Jack Rainaldi and Ron Daugh-
erty and junior Earl McConnell.
Once again the Blue and Gold
gymnasts will be tutored by War-
ren Neiger.

Although Coach Neiger is en-
couraged by the performances
of most of his gymnasts, he is
bothered by the lack of depth
in certain events, especially side
horse and ﬂying rings. “If there
is any depth this year, it must
be furnished by several of our
sophomores,” stated Neiger after
a recent practice.

Neiger was a gymnastic star as
a student at Olney High School in
North Philadelphia under Coach
Ed Mueller and captained the
team in his senior year. He at-
tended Penn State and competed
in gymnastics for three years un-
der Coach Gene Wettstone.

He was a member of the Na-

\.

‘~”‘v"tional AAU championship squad

"\

in 1945. In 1946 the present Pan-
ther boss placed second in the
Olympic All—Around competition
in the Eastern championships.
State also won the EIGL team ti-
tles in 1945.and 1946. ’ ’
In gym _ competition Neiger
specialized on’the high bar, par-
allel bars and ﬂying rings. After
graduating from State in 1947
he became assistant gym coach
at Georgia Tech. .

Neiger also served as a physical
education instructor at the South-
ern school for ﬁve years. He came
to Pitt in 1952 to teach physical
education and take over the gym-
nastics coaching work, dual ca-
pacities which he still ﬁlls.

when the ﬁnal three contestants
captured their -matches to reverse
the ﬁnal score. Jeff Ware _capped
the triumph when he pinned
Rockey Gillette at 1:14 in the final
heavyweight duel.

Duff Killian got the Panthers
off to a winning start in the 123-
pound class when he decisioned
Bill Lucas 4-0. Navy captured the
next two matches, however, when
Crawford beat Bill Solominsky
8-3, and Den Farra pinned Tom
Bailey at 6:47. ‘

Bailey’s ‘loss was unfortunate
for he was winning because» of
superior riding time with a 2-2
count, but he suffered a dislo-
cated shoulder. Calvin Cum-

with a win in the 147 pound

F rosh Matmen Defeat
Navy in Last 3 Matches

Coach Dave Johnson guided his yearling grapplers to a
rallyingJl9-16 victory over Navy in their second meet of the
infant mat season on Saturday. Varsity coach, Rex Perry
must have felt mixed emotions over the win by his proteges,
for in winning they spoiled the debut of his son Ed as
wrestling coach at the Naval Academy.

The Cubs were behind 16-6°

\

Bob Meineg 7-2, and Phil Grey
of Navy pinned Lee Pritton at

-3:45 to enhance the score to 16-6'":

in favor of the Annapolis‘ plebes.

Ken Barr ignited the winning
surge when he pinned Bill
Morgan at 6:47 in the 177-pound
class. In the most clearly decisive
match of the meet. Torn Jeftffries
had everything on John Harder
but the mat cover. I

That set the stage for VVare’s
timely pin to clinch the win.
Johnson’s yearlings defeated the
Indiana State varsity in the
first encounter 33-3.

The rival coaches, Johnson and
Ed Peery, were teammates on the
Panther Eastern championship
team in 1957. They both won
EIWA titles that season.

A second statement in the re-
port says: “Since our University
does not believe in ‘randomiza-

mates, it has made extensive

use of the photographs and na-

roommates."

“That statement is just not

Pattern Continued

Another item in the‘ report
says: “This pattern of segrega-
tion has continued into the. pres-'
ent trimester and the most out-
standing example is in Holland
Hall where there are three fresh-
man Negro students and two up-
perclassmen rooming together.’

“We are _ sorry about these
two instances," Swartzbaugh
commented. “This is an excep-
tion to our policy."

Dr. Swartzbaugh also said that
the separate lists for Negro and
white students for applicants of
housing in private. homes had
been eliminated recently.
