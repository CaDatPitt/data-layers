Hospital Records starts pilot program  

By Kathy Campbell
Staff Writer

The National Tumor Registrars
Association (NTRA) has selected Pitt‘s

Health Records Administration pro- -—

gram in the School of Health Related
Professions to pilot the first integrated
Health Records Administration Disease
Registration curriculum in the United
States. Pitt's program was chosen from
a possible 55 medical record programs
across the country. _

It will prepare students for taking ex-
aminations in Health Records Ad-
ministration and Disease Registry. In
order to do this, students will be
educated in designing, establishing and
managing disease registries, which pro-
vide quality health data needed for pa-
tient care, patient follow—up, research
and overall management of the health
care facility.

Dr. Mervat Abdelhak, associate pro-
fessor at the School of Health Related
Professions at Pitt helped develop the
program. She explained that a registry
is a data collection system of both
demographic data and common data of
patients with a certain disease. Thus,
when a patient enters a hospital with
a disease such as cancer, the hospital
would begin to collect data, such as
treatments and procedures used on the
patient, and even a lifetime follow-up

-'. n~_-.,..V;._.;__ ..;~.-.».g\,_._ . .v.

program will be starting, which will be
used to check his progress.

Through this data collection, a

number of studies are implemented.
For example, if a patient had received
a .certain successful treatment, then
more research can be done on this type
of treatment aided by the facts record-
ed in the disease registry.
, A disease registry collects and
disseminates profiles on patients
treated, data on the preferred methods
of treatment for a particular disease and
patient survival rates as well as the
resources used in providing the
treatment.

Another possible advantage of this
program may be the development of
connections with the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute at Pitt as well as with other ap-
propriate units within the university and
community, she said. I

This is the first program, Abdelhak
said, to be funded by the NTRA. The
NTRA currently has over 1,000
members, most of whom are directors
of tumor registry programs.

“We’re excited to have been selected
for this program,” said Abdelhak.
“We’re the only one in the country
with such a program. We hope to con-
tinue the program, regardless of the
funding, which will only be for two
years." -

The pilot program began in Sept.
1985. The first class of students is

 

scheduled to graduate in April of 1987.
There are approximately 26 students in
this program, including a few part—time
students. Graduates from this program
will be eligible to take both the
American Medical Record Association
Registration Examination and the
NTRA Certification Examination. As"
a result, these graduates will be able
to secure employment in either ﬁeld or
accept a position that requires both
areasiof study.

David M. Hercules, chairman of the
chemistry department and professor, at
Pitt, has been selected as the 1986 re-
cipient of the American Chemical
Society Award in Analytical
Chemistry. He will be presented with
the award at the organization’s national
meeting in April.

The -award was established to
recognize and to encourage outstanding
contributions to the science of

FAS votes against

‘X’ grade proposal

By Michael Ashford‘
Staff Writer

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) and student members of the FAS
Council voted yesterday-with an over-
whelming majority to adopt the S/N
option which will designate credit/no
entry courses on future student
transcripts. -

The S/N option approved yesterday
will replace the current S/NE option on
transcripts. The vote yesterday also
resolved a volatile debate over the
previous proposal to replace the cur-
rent S/NE option with the letters P/X.

The P/X option, which had been sug-
gested by CAS dean Irwin Schulman,
had been contested by the Student
Government Board and some faculty
members on the grounds that it would
appear as a failing grade on students’
transcripts. '

Changes in the grading come as part

’““6f”'tl‘Ie’ ‘conversion “to” a ‘computerized
student information system which the
university is currently installing.

The vote came after a protracted

Law students offer help
in Judicial Board cases

By William Young
The Pitt News

Since the disbanding of the Legal
Awareness Committee two years ago,
there has been no official organization
to represent students before the Student
Judiciary Board. Al Burke, a third-year

- law student at Pitt, has come up with
a solution — the Law Students’
Defense Counsel. This is an organiza-
tion of ﬁrst-, second- and third-year Pitt
law students that offers free help to
students who request it;

“Most students,” said Burke, “don’t
know where to go for law advice before
going up against the Judiciary Board.
They’re going to be prosecuted by a
third-year law student, and unless they
have a friend in law school who will
help them," they’ll either have to hire
a lawyer or try to defend themselves.
We feel we are capable of representing
them.”

Pittburgh-based Fisher Scientiﬁc Com-
pany sponsors the award.

Dr. W. Richard Howe, assistant
chairman of the chemistry department,
explained that Hercules’ “pioneering
work with electron spectroscopy for
chemical analysis (ESCA) has
demonstrated its utility as a trace
analytical method, and has shown its
effectiveness for key material classes,
such as glass fiber, polymers and den-
tal enamel.”

Hercules is the first chemist to
recognize this potential utility of sur-

discussion which seemed only to con-
fuse the issue at hand. The P/X option
was strongly contested by psychology
professor Merle Mokowitz and Fred
Koloc, director of the CAS advising
center. “Such a change would com-
pletely undermine the intent of the op-
tion, which is to encourage students to

feel free to choose some courses- - ‘’

without fear of recorded failure,”

Koloc argued. 4
After some 30 minutes of discussion,

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, dean of FAS,

interrupted, urging members to conﬁne»

their statements to the issue being
discussed.

Dean Rosenberg clarified the situa-
tion, saying that the FAS was being
asked to vote on a motion pertaining
to the grading procedure. He repeated

that the faculty was to decide upon an .

adequate option for credit/ no entry
courses on the new transcripts since the
FAS has exclusive jurisdiction over all
grading regulations.

In-’ the ﬁnal-rvote, 20 members-«sup--:  A

ported the motion to adopt the S/N op-
tion while approximately three voted
against it.

The LSDC (Law Students’ Defense
Counsel) was started last yearwhen
Burke realized that there was no for-

mal group representing students. To.’

remedy this situation he contacted
several other law students, who became
interested in the idea. .
“When I found out nothing had taken
the Legal Awareness Committee’s
place,” Burke said, “I called up about
10 of my friends who were law students
and asked them if they were interested
in the idea [the LSDC]. I wasn’t sure
if the students had easy enough access
to law students for J-Board defense."
Students, appearing before the Stu-
dent Judiciary Board are not required
to have a law student to. defend them.
In fact, they do not necessarily need
anyone to defend them if they feel
capable of defending themselves. Ac-

cording to Brenda Pardini, coordinator '
of University Student Judicial Affairs, _

Mururoa, French Polynesia — A
spokesman for the environmental
group Greenpeace said French naval
cammandos have boarded and seized
a protest vessel in the South Paciﬁc.
The vessel was attempting to obstruct
a French underground nuclear test at
the Mururoa Atoll. The Greenpeace
spokesman in Washington said the ship
presumably is being taken to Tahiti or
another French possession in the area.

Abbas implicated
in ship hijacking ,

Italy — One of the four Palestinian
hijackers of the cruise ship Archille
Lauro reportedly ﬁngered Moharnmed
Abbas as the mastermind.

Three Italian newspapers issued the
unconﬁrmed report that a hijacker held
in prison at Spoleto, Italy, has decid-
ed to talk. They reported that he iden-
tified Abbas, a member of the Pales-
tinian Liberation Organization Ex-
ecutive Committee, as the director of
the Oct.7 hijacking off the Egyptian
coast.

The reports also said Abbas told the
four not to worry after the Egyptian
jetliner taking them to Tunisia was
forced by U.S. jetﬁghters to land in
Sicily. He reportedly promised to ar-

 

whichever nation held them to get them
released. Abbas is believed to be in
South Yemen after ﬂeeing Italy for
Yugoslavia.

Martin Edmonds, senior lecturer in
politics at the University of Lancaster,
England, said he sees the role of British
universities expanding in Great Brit-
ain’s national defense.

“I believe that in the future, univer-
sities in the United Kingdom will take
a more aggressive outlook in getting
research contracts from the federal
government,” Edmonds said. “To

what cost, however, I’m not sure.”

Edmonds, speaking at the GSPIA
lounge on Tuesday, cited ‘several
reasons for the increased activity be-
tween British universities and - the
British federal government.

1983 . .-

0 1} t _ I A '

“For the past few yeyars, the govem-
ment has reduced or cut out altogether
federal funding for universities,” he
said. “And since United Kingdom
schools are federally funded this meant
a serious lack of income for those col-
leges dependent on the government. As
a ‘result, the colleges had to find another
means of income, and the military
represented a viable option.”

According to Edmonds, the military
does not only conduct research in these
institutions but has implemented a ﬁeld
of study that is taught in the classrooms
— military science. _

‘ ‘It is a ﬁeld of study that emphasizes
military sociology and military educa-
tion,” Edmonds said. “There is also
a type of program that is similiar to the
American ROTC program.”

Dr. Marti1~1iEd1nonds

 

seeks   

Some colleges have entire .depart-
ments devoted to defense studies.

“I’m not talking about large depart-
ments," said Edmonds, however.
“One college only has one professor
in its department.”

The United Kingdom’s ROTC pro-
gram is very attractive to British
students and is used to lure profes-
sionals to the armed forces, he said.

“Britian’s armed forces have a shor-
tage in engineers and scientists, and
they have tried to upgrade their system
to improve the recruitment of graduates
they need,” Edmonds added. “The
package is attractive to British students.
There is no obligation to join the
armed forces and they get a small boun-
ty. Also, they are taught to ﬂy airplanes
— receiving a civilian pilot’s license -
and to drive small boats.”

“Many of the students see the pro-
gram as a supplement for their
diminishing income,” he continued.
“It is an important part of the
university-federal government partner-
ship.”

Despite the increase of federal in-
tervention in colleges, last year only
.0041 percent of the defense budget in
the UK went to the universities, but that
ﬁgure is sure to increase signiﬁcantly
this year, Edmonds pointed out. There

has not been much of a negative reac-

tion by the student population either.
This is a sharp contrast to the United
States where, locally, Carnegie—Me11on
University students are still protesting
the construction of the federally-funded
Software Engineering Institute that will
employ CMU professors.

“The student population is quite con-
servative,” Edmonds said. “By and
large, most students are concerned with
not being one of the 11.5 percent
unemployed Britainers.

“However, there is a tendency to be
militant against the military and try to
expose military studies. .” According to
Edmonds, the militants are the
minority.

“In general, the crisis of funding and
the possibility of bankruptcy ger-
rninates a willingness to compromise,”
he said. “And I see no major uprising

Opinion

The Pitt News, October 25, 1985

New Promise

Very soon, students of the University of Pittsburgh
will be electing a new Student Government president
and new members to the Student Government Board.
We advise students to inform themselves and to choose
wisely from among the various candidates.

In view of the impending elections, we would like to
take this opportunity to exhort whomever will be the new
incoming officers to serve in a manner beﬁtting the trust
imparted to them. It is the duty of student government
officers to serve the interests of the student in an eager,
honest, diligent, innovative and courageous manner. We
hope that our new officers will avoid the self—serving
hypocrisy that is all too common in politics at all levels.

Furthermore, we urge any new officers to serve as

the students’ voice to the university administration. Cer-
tainly, the Student Government Board should not fear
to confront the administration, should intrepidly express
student demands to the administration, and. in ad-
ministrative decision-making, should take up the
students’ cause in any issues which affect them. We cau-
tion against becoming intimidated by the administration.
It’s far too easy to fall under the dominance of the ad-
ministration. Don’t allow yourselves to become the ad-
ministration’s voice to the students.

Finally, we call on our soon-to—be—deterrnined incom-
ing officers to keep students informed about ad-
ministrative deliberations regarding changes in univer-
sity policy, organization or procedures which will have
an impact on the students’ lives. Too often students are
kept in ignorance of even the most profound policy deci-
sions until after the fact, leaving them little opportunity
to inﬂuence policy.

With fresh-faced optimism, we look forward to com-
petent and efficacious student government leadership.
Please, don’t disappoint us.

Letters to the Editor

. Bad Editing

I feel it is high time to speak out
about The Pitt News and the people
who edit the editorials. First, on the
positive note, I would like to con-
gratulate the entire Pitt News staff for
its constant hard work. Second, I would
like to offer some constructive criticism
to the person or persons responsible for
editing _the editorials.

Another ﬁne example is on the same
subject (South Africa), in which I
stated, “As I write the ﬁnal paragraphs
to this article, the tears roll down my
face for my brothers and sisters -who
have died for a little thing called
freedom! I guess the white man can

sleep good tonight being assured that A

somewhere in the world he can still
keep the black man down and make a
proﬁt at the same time. Just like
slavery, remember!” The last two
sentences were designed to express _my
feelings and awake the emotions in all
individuals that did not realize the
ser-iousness of apartheid in South
Africa! But that feeling was not relayed
because my First Amendment rights
were temporarily altered by, of all peo-
ple, the press.

I have written articles which I feel
were somewhat sliced and diced
beyond recognition. You seem to have
the ability of taking my feelings and
views and changing or diluting them.
For example, in an article I wrote con-
cerning divestment from South Africa,
I stated equal rights were somethng that
we as Americans fought for and we
who are minorities still ﬁght for. You
changed it to read simply, “something
that we as Americans still fight for."
I am a black man, and my view is that
minorities are the only ones in America
still ﬁghting for equal rights, not all
Americans! If you want to say all

V Americans, then you should write your

own editorial so you can express your
views and not alter mine!

Iunderstand that your letter policy’

stipulates the right to edit letters, but
you should take the liberty to edit only
when abusive language, threats,
misspelled words and incorrect English
are used, not to change a person’s
views.

I hope that this article can make it
through that chopping machine of
yours without getting sliced and diced
to the editorial department's likings and
views. I remind you that the purpose
of the editorial column is for students
and others to express theiropinions and
views. Thanking you in advance for
having the guts and the true spirit of
the First Amendment to print this as is!

Right to Hunt

In. reply to Ms. Lydick’s letter, I
would like to get a few of the facts
straight. An overwhelming majority of
hunters would not let an injured deer
escape; that would be inhumane. The
deer in Pennsylvania’s forests die
because of the following reasons (in
order of mortality rates they are): 1)
natural causes (starvation, sickness and
old age); 2) attacks by packs of wild
dogs; 3) automobile collisions; and 4)
hunting. .

I wonder if Ms. Lydick would pur-
sue.a deer after hitting it with a car as
diligently as hunters do after after fail-

. ing to make a clean kill? I doubt it.

As far as egos are involved, I have
seen far more hunters humbled by
defenseless deer than I have ever seen
trophies mounted _on a wall. Deer
haven.’t survived millions of years by
being cute. They are intelligent and
they are experts at camouﬂage and the
use of cover. They are as fast as the
wind and have auditory and olfactory
senses that are extremely acute. They
are a true challenge, and hunters have
the greatest respect for them.

Hunters are a large population of
responsiblesportsmen who are con-
cerned with making our state home to
all kinds of wildlife, both hunted and
protected. They are glad that bald
eagles are again nesting in our state.
They are glad that other endangered
species like the bobcat, have begun to
proliferate in our woods again.

Much of our state’s reforestation is
due to the replanting of trees by land
owners. Trees that were paid for en-
tirely by monies from the license fees
of hunters.

The bobcat, the bald eagle, the elk
and the grey wolf are all present in
Pennsylvania because the license fees
paid by hunters support the programs
and the management of th areas in
which these animals have been in-
troduced or have reappeared. Not a bad
deal for $10 a year.‘ I am sure other
hunters don’t mind if I say that on
behalf of all responsible hunters, you’re
welcome, it was our pleasure.

Free Speech

The Louis Farrakhan issue, widely
discussed last spring, has once again
arisen as a hot topic on campus and

come down to a battle of freedom of
speech vs. the allocation of student
funds.

Personally, I do not agree with
anything that Rev. Farrakhan says and

"because of‘ his violent anti-Semitism

and other remarks, I don’t particular-
ly like the man. However, one of the
ideals that our nation was founded upon
was the principle of freedom of speech.
I feel that it is right in allowing Rev.
Farrakhan to speak here. A university
is intended to be an arena for the free
expression of ideas. We cannot be
selective in whom we allow to speak.
By hearing him speak, those who at-
tend will realize his prejudices. Final-’
ly, no one is being forced to hear him
and I doubt those who do will be
swayed by him.

The allocation of student funds for

this speech was approved by the stu— .

dent government. The Black Action
Society has a right to use their ap-
propriated funds for any speaker they
wish, as does any other group. All of
us pay into the activities fund. Several
thousand students will never be
unanimous on how the money is to be
spent. I don’t always approve of the
way this money is spent but it is

I ultimately up to the student groups.

I understand the outrage of those
whom Rev. Farrakhan’s attacks are
directed against, but the right of
freedom of speech must be maintained.
His words of Nov. 14 will not serve
to hurt the Jewish people, but I believe
they will bring more people against
him. '

The Pitt News, October 25, 1985,

F or The Dissent/l\/[arc   Chandler

Pssst. . .Hey Look, Your House is on Fire!

I have tried to remain out of the fray
but would be derelict in my respon-
sibilities if I remained so: While you
have been busy trying to put out the ﬁre
that has enflamed South Africa, your
own house has been smoldering.
Racism remains an enduring part of the
American social fabric no matter how
bad South Africa appears by
comparison.

Institutionalized racism deﬁes pure-
ly quantitative measurement. There is
simply no way to measure the violence
done to the spirit and morale of
racism’s victims. Yet, there are some
indicators. An 18-month study by the
Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices recently concluded that the
disparity in health conditions for blacks
and whites is distressing. Black infant
mortality is greater than in some so-
called Third World countries.

A study by the Congressional
Research Service and the Congres-
sional Budget Ofﬁce found that almost
half of all black children, some 46.7
percent, were in poverty in 1983, com-
pared to 15 percent of white children.
Between 1968 and 1981 the poverty
rate for black children fluctuated bet-
ween 39 and 45 percent. In 1982 it
reached a high of 47.3 percent. “The
average black child can expect to spend
more than ﬁve years of childhood in
poverty; the average white child, less
than 10 months — black poverty lasts
longer and is less affected by changes
in family composition. "

Since 1980, black families have lost
ground in absolute and relative terms.
One third of all blacks are impoverish-
ed. Black joblessness is more than

twice as high as that of whites. In ad-.

dition, minority businesses are getting

a smaller share of federal contract
money under the Reagan administra-
tion. For the first time in 15 years, the
percentage of contract money going to
minority businesses declined for two
consecutive years.

The Urban League’s 1985 report
notes that “the national will to take
positive steps to set the scales of justice
into balance has diminished tremen-
dously over the past 10 years." We
have witnessed the erosion of our na-
tional commitment to an open society
dedicated to equal opportunity and af-
ﬁrmative action.

Let us be frank and call things as they
really are: It is not just the anthromor-
phized nation or the reiﬁed state that
is the problem, but it is also us. In
March 1982, William Harvey, assistant
vice provost for curriculum and in-

struction at the State University of New
York at Stonybrook commented that
“the past year has seen an outpouring
of racial animosity on campuses across
the country. Colleges and universities
— large and small, urban and rural,

public and private — have witnessed
ugly incidents that only a few years ago
would have been unthinkable.”
Moreover, we still tend to associate
predominantly with our own race.
Even our socialization patterns are
segregated. The de facto segregation
we experience is more subtle and
therefore arguably more dangerous
than segregation de jure, as in South
Africa.

It is easy for our troubled conscience
to point to the faraway South Africa
and say, “How naughty.“ And it is in-
deed horrible. But can we really afford

to be self-righteous? Need we be
reminded that South Africa’s apartheid
regime was installed in an effort to ap-
pease the West, chieﬂy the United

States and England, whose own record ‘

on civil rights and racial equality is not
now nor has it ever been something to
gloat about?

It is not that our own dirty hands _

should paralyze us from any action, but
if we are truly interested in getting rid
of racism, root and branch, and not
merely its worst excesses, as in South
Africa, should we not simultaneously
ﬁght tr exorcise racism from our per-
sonal - 1 political lives in America? Is
not this the enduring message of Jesse
Jackson‘s presidential campaign and,
though in a perverted and twisted way,
the underlying theme of Louis Far-
rakhan’s antagonistic rhetoric?

Washington Post Writers Group/Richard Cohen

Sexual Discrimination Among Public Officials

What makes these clubs important is that they
validate sexism. They say that there really are
times when women can be excluded just because
they are women — because they are threatening
or distracting or whatever reason either thought or

enunciated.

Laurence H. Silberman is a Reagan
administration nominee to the U.S.
Court of Appeals. Almost no one
would argue that Silberman is not
qualiﬁed for the post. He is a former
Justice Department ofﬁcial, general
counsel of the‘Crocker National Bank
and a graduate of both ‘Dartmouth and
Harvard.

But Silberman was_also a member of
the Metropolitan Club, a private

Washington institution with a
wonderful-looking library, great loca-
tion and a 122-year record of only the
most grudging accommodation to the
concept of equality. At one time, the
club had no black or Jewish members,

.but it now has a few of each,
presumably making some of the
members feel like they have rejoined
the Young Trotsky Club of their more

radical youth. What it does not have —

either by policy or by 122 years of un-

broken happenstance — is women.
The Metropolitan is one member

short this week. Larrv Silberman has

resigned. He did so only after Sen. Paul »

Simon threatened to block his nomina-
tion to the bench. When Simon offered
Silberman a choice between his club
and his career, Silberman chose his
career. God knows where he’ll eat
now. _

Some thingshave to be said right off.
The ﬁrst is that if Silberman had been
a member of a club that barred blacks
as members, he would not have been
given a choice but the door instead.
Why it is just awful to discriminate
against blacks but perfectly all right to
do the same to women is a question that

only Silberman, in his wisdom, can
answer. It smells the same to me.
What makes these clubs important is
that they validate sexism. They say that
there really are times when women can
be excluded just because they are

women —— because they are threaten-

ing or distracting or whatever reason
either thought or enunciated.

Back in the early 1960s, some Ken-
nedy administration appointees had to
quit Washington clubs that would not
admit blacks. The reason for that had
nothing to do with the clubs
themselves; they were hardly important
civil-rights battlegrounds and inconse-
quential compared to, say, schools or
buses. But racism was a problem in
American society and the clubs — no

matter how insigniﬁcant — were part
of that problem. What’s true of racism
is also true of sexism. It, too, has its
victims. '

Maybe if the Silbermans of the world
were denied their seats on the bench for
belonging to clubs like the
Metropolitan in the ﬁrst place, the
message would get around that sex
bigotry, like racial. and religious
bigotry, is unacceptable. You should
not be able to belong to a club that
discriminates when it suits you and then
quit for the same reason. By joining,
you have made a declaration of prin-
ciple: Having a place to eat downtown
with some swell fellas is more impor-
tant than the ﬁght against sexual
discrimination.

Greeks sponsor “Trace a Child”
to stop increase of missing children

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer »_

Over the past seven weeks, nearly
16,000 children in the Pittsburgh area
have been ﬁngerprinted in‘ an attempt
to reduce the number of missing
children in the area.

“This is basically a public service,”
said Louise Jeremiah, project coor-
dinator of the “Trace a Child” ‘cam-
paign, ‘ ‘that has been conceived out of
the need to stop'the increase of miss-
ing children.”

The ﬁngerprinting campaign is be-
ing implemented by Pitt’s Alpha Delta
Pi sorority and Mu Kappa Upsilon, a
Pitt band fraternity.

“We’ll be fingerprinting and
photographing children at local Giant
Eagle stores,” said Denise Vekasy,
service chairperson for Alpha Delta Pi
sorority, “every Friday and Saturday
from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. until

Halloween

(UPI) — Halloween: it’s not just for
kids anymore. People in the business
say more adults are playing dress-up
on Halloween.

Motivational psychologist Chr-is
Martin says wearing a costume tends
to reduce inhibitions. That’s obvious,
but there’s more to it. Martin, who is
a consultant to Hallmark cards,
believes, “Celebrating Halloween is a
way for baby boomers to start their

. own traditions.’ ’

Makers of costumes report selling
more outﬁts made for adults. Sam Cor-
nish of the Collegeville Costume Mak-
ing Company said, “The biggest thing

Nov. 9.”

According to Vekasy, the parents of
children who are brought in will ﬁll out
two separate cards. The ﬁrst card will
be for the family’s ﬁles and will con-
tain the child’s name, age, height,
weight, hair color, eye color, the name
of the family doctor and the doctor's

. phone number. The other card contain-

ing similiar information will be given
to the child. This card will be laminated
and should be attached to the child’s
clothing so that if the child gets lost or
hurt, there will be phone numbers
available. 0

“The child’s name is not on the
laminated card so they can’t be enticed
"by a stranger who could read their
name and use it as a way of luring the
child to hi. ., ” said Vekasy.

The “'1 race A Child” campaign ac-
tually began in Los Angeles at the same

time that “Adam,” a TV special about

a missing child, ran on the air.

“Pepsi-Cola began the campaign,”
said Jeremiah. “And since then it has
spread throughout the country.”

In this area, approximately 41 Giant
Eagle stores are participating in the
ﬁngerprinting campaign. Children of
any age can participate and it is free.
“We’ve had children of all ages come
in,” said Vekasy. “Anywhere from
six-day-old babies to kids fourteen and
ﬁfteen years old.”

Also, the campaign is not sponsored
by the police. “A lot of people think
that the police are involved,” said
Vekasy, “but it’s just between the
parent and child.”

However, will the campaign really
help reduce the number of missing
children?

“We’d like to think so,” said

0 Jeremiah. “And'even if it were to help

ﬁnd one child it will be a-success.”

New York specializes in children. She
says Halloween is the one day of the
year children put on their favorite iden-
titles with their parents’ approval.

During the year, she says, a child_

must merely make do with imagination
and makeshift costumes, but “at Hallo-
ween he can pull out all the stops.”

She said she sees similiar dynamics
at work in costume parties for adults.
Jacque ‘said she generally ﬁnds that
people In their 30s and late 20s are the
ones who are giving costume parties.
She ﬁgures it is because they are the
ﬁrst generation of American children
to grow up in an era that was afﬂuent
enough to let them be “fancy free.”
She says the ’50s were a stable time and
believes a lot of costume parties are
ways of recapturing that period of
stability in one’s life. Jacque says that

A few rock-n-roll bands make it big,
others spend a day in the sun, and
most are lucky to have ever produced
a record. The most intriguing, though,
are those with raw, honest talent who
appear on the outer fringe of rock —
bands who wish to define the music on
their own terms and expand its bound-
aries. Bands, for instance, like X.

Los Ange/es, their first record , owed
as much to Jefferson Airplane as it did
the Ramones. But there was also

something different, an urgency or ten-
sion in the music that could be as
unsettling as it was inspiring, as
threatening as it was fun.

Although a critical favorite again and
again, X has been viewed most often
in contrast, not in comparison, to their
contemporaries. Such talk has scared
off many a radio programmer and thus
severely limited thescope of their au-
dience. Five years and four albums
after Los Angeles it's still an uphill
climb for the band, even with the
slicker, accessible Ain’t Love Grand.

THE BARRACKS THIEF
By Tobias Wolff

Ecco

By Walter Ray Watson

Tobias Wolff deserves wider
recognition for his contributions to the
short story form. His first collection, In
The Garden of the North American Mar-

tyrs, established the talent and crafts-
manship of a thoughtful and often
clever writer. in that collection,
characters and situations disturb or
provoke readers to think. At other
times, his sharp wit, lean descriptions
and resonant dialogue make Wolff’s
audiences feel they've missed
something. But perhaps they have.
The subtleties and well-placed
metaphors abound; several of them
appear in his stories published by Es-
quire, The Atlantic Monthy and, yes,
even that haven for spare, lean, mean
short stories, The New Yorker. His
skillful relaying of tales, his choices of
different voices for the telling and his
ability to maintain an understandable,
yet understated, narrative. Wolff’s vi-

sion of life is somewhere short of the
bright lights but often just escaping the
inevitable darkness.

Wolff’s subjects leap from hunters
and the hunted to Catholic upbringings
to military servitude; the stories
manifest themselves through charac-
ters from disparate beginnings: the
middle class, the upper crust, the
South, the Northwest, the restaurant
business, through infidelity and points

' beyond. The Barracks Thief is a novella

which explores the lives of three
paratroopers and their guarding of a
munitions depot near the peak of the
Vietnam War. ‘ '
The book is impressive because he
takes a challenging tack — his
characters view the war from their Ar-
my base at home, guarding it and liv-
ing life with its complexities stateside.
As a result, a good deal of Wolff’s
understanding and that of his
characters imparts upon the reader.
The Barracks Thief provides the power
and weight of books twice its length.
Wolff masters his thoughtful prose
here, with effects that glow and

moments that go off like depth
charges, shaking readers with anxie-
ty and anticipation. Mine fields of over-
wrought sentiment .and war-weary
metaphors are gratefully avoided. The
writer's hand rarely shows fingerprints
on this work, except when the point of
view changes, but once the jump out
is made, a nearly-seamless piece of
writing emerges. -

Money is stolen from men on the

base and the ensuing alienation,
distrust and empathy toward the thief
delicately color the perceptions of a
strangely familiar world. The relation-
ships, for example, of both military and
civilian life, lay bare the predicament
of humanity without claiming expert or
final words on the matter. - .
The Barracks Thief is no moralist’s

. tale; by the end of this chronicle ques-

tions remain» unanswered. Tobias

Wolff writes a short take on the long _

subject as well as anyone living or
dead. The novella is filled with his con-

cerns without disclosing his judg-

ments, which, in today’s world of im-
portant literature, is no criminal act.

Evil fails when good women do something

By Matthew Yokobosky .

“Evil flourishes when good men do
nothing,” and the old theme roars on.
Frank Capra became noted for
populistic views in his Meet John Doe
and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,
and few directors since his directorial
peak have made substantial im-
provements on his basic approach.
The latest of these ‘‘little man vs. the
hierarchy” films is Richard
Donaldson’s Marie, a true story about
Marie Ragghiantti, a woman who
observed corruption in government
and came forward to announce these
injustices to the public.

Marie is based on the best-selling
novel by Peter Maas, Marie: A True
Story, which recounts‘Marie’s struggle
as a battered wife to her position as
chairman of pardons and paroles. Star-
ring Sissy Spacek (Carrie, Coal Miner’s
Daughter, The River), Marie expands
upon Capra’s initial approach and
replaces Jimmy Stewart with a 1980s
version of John/Jane Doe. Marie was
an average homemaker, but she
chose to acquire a college education
and ultimately received gubernatorial
appointment. Though once she
achieved her long-range goal of finan-

cial security and independence, she»

realizes that her idealistic vision of
justice was no more than a pipe dream
in a state filled with elected govern-
ment corruption.

Following Watergate, honesty in law
has become a strong topic in all forms
of the media, resulting in the press’

and the public’s new fearless com-
mentary and backing for the
unobstruction of justice. Through this
means, government officials have
been skeptically viewed under the
thumb of public opinion and scrutiny,
thus creating a fear among appointed
officials in light of the media’s in-
fluence on potential supporters.

  

Screening Marie from this perspective,
it is a very realistic text which rein-
forces and supports America’s newly
realized (somewhat) cooperative
government of checks and balances
between the voters and those elected,
catapulting Marie as a believable
representation of this democratic
idealization/fact.

While the film is not flashy, visual or

technically creative, this film uses. a S

minimalistic structure which is depen-
dent on strong actors and a well-
written script. Using her prior
midwestern roles as background,
Spacek utilizes her countrified, emo-
tional acting style to interpret Marie's
disruptive homelife and job as a
humanistic and righteously motivated
female in the depths of Southern men-
tality — a world where few women are
recognized as equals to men.

Marie obtains her job because she
is a woman, a Democrat and mainly
because of her unthreatening de-
meanor. But consequently, when her
respectability as a representative of
the parole board becomes questioned,
Marie bites the hand that fed her and
ultimately kills the sleeping dog of
deceit that had prevailed unnoticed in

Tennessee’s criminal court. It seems .

hard to believe that a good woman
could undermine the evil lurking in the
state government, especially consider-
ing Spacek’s frail exterior. But even-
tually, a strength likened to her
previous portrayal of Loretta Lynn in
Coal Miner’s Daughter explodes on the
screen.

it appears that the old country hard-
ships are once again producing virile
minds in delicate frames in movieslike
Marie. This 1980s Capra-esque drama
is one to be seen, with music swelling
and emotions running high at every
twist and turn, evoking a well-deserved
sob from every member of the au-
dience. Make sure you take a case of
Kleenex with you. A,

   

 

‘ 7 " Showcase ,“Octob:c1l'lll-l,2'5l,‘-

By Lory Faiella

Its title gives way to the main point
of the play. Sexual Perversity in
Chicago deals exactly with what it
describes: modern sexual attitudes or
blunt perversity.

The play is set on the North Side of
Chicago, a city filled with the neoteric
ideas typical of any metropolitan area.
The underlying theme of the play is
how these modern ideas can affect the
individual and that individual’s per-
sonal relationships. Playwright David
Mamet uses humor effectively to bring
his view of an often closeted subject
out in the open.

Sexual Perversity in Chicago is a
libertine, extremely sexual comedy

about a young couple who fall in love

only to have their relationship battered
and brutalized by the intervening ad-
vice of their friends.

The acting in Sexual Perversity in
Chicago is wildly vivid and believable.
Each character (there are four
altogether) depicts a different human
situation, a different, slightly overlap-

ping outlook on life and love.

Torn Corsetti plays Bernard Litko, an
oversexed macho type of guy who
thinks he is indeed a gift to women. His
outlook on life is harsh and insensitive,
relying heavily on perversion-
Throughout the play, Bernard tries to
convince his friend Danny (Joseph
Comm) that a loving, meaningful rela-
tionship just isn't possible in this
modern world. Sex is the answer to
everything.

Debra Soloman (Donna Harfenist) is
Danny’s girlfriend —— at least until they
become victimized by their friends’
negative views of love. Debra, a com-
mercial artist, believes in her relation-
ship with Danny until it turns

“Our music was louder and faster than
what was being programmed for the
radio. The problem is fitting into what
radio programmers feel is consistent
with what they want to play. With this
record, we've done that and still, I
think, maintained a certain amount of
integrity and soul to the music. The
fact that it's got a radio playable sound

. isn't basically bad.”

In retrospect the band must feel a
certain satisfaction; they weren’t
always concerned about things as lof-

. ty as the airwaves.

“When we started out,” Doe recall-
ed, ‘‘I just wanted to quit my day job.”

Exene Cervenka, the band’s lead
vocalist who happens also to be mar-
rie_d to Doe, remembered the earlier
days. “There were about three places
to play at that time, you have to
realize.” Cervenka scaned the stage
set-up from our table inside Graffiti. ‘‘It
wasn't like this then. Eight years ago,

there weren’t any nightclubs, there ‘

weren’t any promoters, there weren’t
any halls and there wasn’t an audience
and there weren’t any records. There
was just the Clash, the Sex Pistols and
the Flamones and singles coming out
— Tom Petty and Blondie were con-
sidered really underground. We just
started playing around and trying to
get new clubs opened.”

Doe smiled adding, “You know, at
that time we weren’t allowed to play at
the Whiskey (a club in L.A.)  The im-
portant thing about all this is that you
can't take for granted the fact that
there is good music_and there’s a club
to play in. We’ve seen it off and on all
over the country and all over the world.

pathetically sour.

Jean Weber (Hazel Carr Leroy) is
Debra’s frustrated friend, a somewhat
distraught schoolteacher. She, like

, Bernard, doesn’t trust love, nor does

she trust men.

All four performers express the emo-
tional hang-ups of the characters so
convincingly that it is hard not to be
taken in by the drama of the events.

Although the content could be con-
sidered embarrassing or too forward
by some, it does ring true to reality.
Sexual Perversity in Chicago is a real
eye-opener. The language, the blunt-
ness, the hostility and openness are
shocking in some instances. This,
however, is balanced by the humor
that is filtered throughout the play.

Mamet has been praised for his
creative, lively writing style by such
popular publications as The New York
Times. The dialogue in Sexual Perver-
sity in Chicago demonstrates this style;
the lines are catchy and descriptive.

Few of the lines are appropriate for
the public press. As the warning sign
outside the Studio Theatre entrance,
suggests, if profanity is offensive to
your ears, Sexual Perversity in Chicago
could possibly sting a little. If, on the
other hand, you don’t mind a little
vulgarity, it’s quite a good play.

An Obie Award winner, Sexual
Perversity in Chicago takes a serious
subject — an often concealed subject
—— and shows it with all the lights on.
Abstraction is not a problem in the
play. Although it deals with a serious
issue, the play manages to end on a
happy note, with the two males enjoy-
ing the “scenery” at the beach.

For the open-minded, Sexual Perver-
sity in Chicago has its appeal. As Ber-
nie Litko says, “Don’t ever lose your
sense of humor.” .

  

Serius issues and Sexual Perversity in Chicago

A oseph Comm and Dona Harfenist play a young couple searching for love
and happiness in Sexual Perversity in Chicago. ‘

t>>>>>>>>>>5>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

People will say, ‘Well this club has

been here for five years and it will be
here in five more.’ That kind of com-

 

 

Dave Hooker/The Pitt News
placency is what ruins popular music
and that’s when it gets really rotten.”

Cervenka carried the point. “It’s
hard to keep clubs open and it's a real
fight. But we’ve already fought it for
years and years, so there’s nothing

else we can do. lt’s like that cutting

edge thing. We’ve served our time in
hell.”

On the lighter side, there’s the Knit-
ters. The Knitters, a collaborative effort
on the part of Doe, Cervenka, X drum-
mer D.J. Bonebrake, Dave Alvin of the
Blasters and Johny Flay Bartel started
playing traditional, often sappy, coun-
try and western music at benefit con-
certs and ended up recording a fairly
successful indie on Slash records.

The motivation? According to

Cervenka, “It’s like what you do at‘

home, you listen to the Ramones and
then you put on a Merle Haggard
record.”

Doe, as usual, sees more to it. ‘‘I
think we did the Knitters to emphasize
that part of X that was in, say, More
Fun in the New World and pull it out
and say, OK here’s the real thing, let's
not bastardize it by having electric
guitars. And then we pulled that out of
X. Then X was left more rock-n-roll. I
think this record is kind of figuring out
what we want to do and the next record
will probably decide what parts of the
old records and this new record will
make the right combination.” He
laughed, “And then the safe opens
and there’s a million dollars inside!!”

Cervenka shook her head, “Yeah
sure!”

What about success? What about
money and screaming kids?

Cervenka again looked serious.
“You don’t think about it,” she said.
‘‘well, you think about it —— but not
seriously because you don’t know the
future. You just go along and you’re
working the record on tour and you

_want good things to happen while

you’re on the road. If they don’t, then
you get depressed and you’ll want to
go home. So, you want to hear that
MTV’s still playing it and that the col-
Iege stations are still playing it. So you
know the thing’s still selling and things
like that. Otherwise you’re yvasting
your time being in a band — if no one
wants to hear you.”

“There’s always hope,” says Doe,
‘‘I mean, I don’t envy Duran Duran not
being able to walk down the street but
on the other hand I’d like a lot of peo-
ple to hear us — it's disheartening
when you play Cleveland and there’s
350 people there. That’s a drag; then
you do think about these things and
hopefully you’re strong enough to just
pass it off as being Cleveland. Hopeful-
Iy things will get better. But I think,
yeah, there’s a certain point when you
say ‘|’ve done it, it’s been fun and
that’s fine and I'll see you later.’ That’s
natural and new bands will come up
and then you don’t get the thing like
Heart and Starship.”

Cervenka interrupted, “Yeah, what
the hell do they think they’re doing.”

“That’s why I like it when a band
says OK we did good and now we'll
leave room for another band to do
something else and~we’|l do something
else,” Doe continued.

So what lies beyond?

Cervenka was quick to reply, “Well,
John and I are full fledged actors now.
[Doez Salvador, L.A. Woman and
Spanish Kitchen; Cervenka:
“NightCrawIers” episode in the new
“Twilight Zone” series.] We’ve done
a lot of acting and we like it and we're
pretty good at it —‘— so we can always

do that."

Showcase , October 25, 1985. A

Romantics at their k-n—ro//in

THE ROMANTICS
Carnegie-Mellon University
Oct. 19, 1985

The Romantics played at the
Carnegie-Mellon gym Saturday night,
roaring through a 90-minute set of their
best known material for some 1,300
appreciative, if somewhat restrained,
fans. The concert provided a
showcase for rock at its hook—laden,
good-timing best.

The evening began with a weak per-
formance from Norm Nardini. His lewd,
fumbling stage antics and seemingly
ceaseless spew of ridiculously sexist

lyrics only served to alienate the au-'

dience. The disfavor reached its peak
when nearly half of the people on the
floor sat down during “Nobody But

You,” and shouts of “Norman, it ain’t'

workin’, buddy!” were directed at the
stage. Although the Tigers are a
talented musical outfit — especially
their guitarist, keyboard player and
saxophonist — Nardini’s songs just
couldn't win the crowd over past the
band’s hit ‘‘If You Don’t Want Me.”

The Romantics met with a decided-
ly more receptive response as they
took the stage, appearing‘ in their
trademark “stageskins,” this time
matching snakeskin-patterned leather
pants and coats over black shirts. The
band kicked off their performance with
a high-energy version of “Let’s Get
Started” from Rhythm Romance and
kept the party atmosphere alive with
fiery run-throughs of “Rock You Up”
and “One In A Million.” '

“Rock You Up” appeared third in

   

the set, with new drummer David
Petratos singing his first lead vocal of
the night. Petratos proved more than
up to the task, singing with a pur-
poseful delivery uniquely his own. His
drumming also shone, his playing so
steady one would think he's been play-
ing with the band much longer than he
has.VThe Romantics don’t seem to

have been affected at all by Jimmy
Marinos’ departure. ’

The concert continued with the band
spotlighting its biggest songs. Between
playing hits like “Talking In Your
Sleep” and “Mystified,” the Roman-
tics touched on their older songs and
did an inspired playing of “Better Make
A Move” from their new record. The

audience stayed with the band for-

every beat, as time and again the
group called for sing-alongs, hand
clapping and shouting from the crowd.
The audience as a whole wasn’t.in-
credibly vocal but danced along with
nearly every song and responded en-
thusiastically to performances of the
band’s hits.

Not only was the rocking at-
mosphere of the Romantics’ records
brought out on stage, but the band’s
vocal harmonies were as dead-on as-
vinyl, and Wally Palmar’s singing was

particularly animated. Mike Skill’s bass 

playing was sharp all through the
show, and Coz Canler’s guitar work
stood out, too. Can|er’s jaunts across
the stage brought him noticeable reac-
tions from the crowd, and Palmar’s re-
quests for audience participation came
off every time. -

The set closed with the band’s
classic song ‘‘What I Like About You”
segueing into “Shake A Tail Feather”
from In Heat. Loud cheers brought the
band back for a single encore number
before the lights came on, and the
show officially ended. _

The Romantics turned in a slick,
charged performance Saturday at
CMU. Each member of the band has
such obvious fun on stage that it's dif-
ficult not to get caught up in the excite-
ment of their performances. Years of
touring haven't dampened the en-'
thusiasm of the Romantics, andvthe
band stands poised to continue to of-
fer fans the satisfaction of their original
brand of rock-and-roll escapism.

COSI FAN TUTTI FRUTTI
Squeeze
A & M

It was quite a trauma when, in the
late fall of 1982, the news came that
Squeeze had called it quits. Only
months earlier, The Jam, who had
been my favorite band, had broken up;
and Squeeze, who had then become
my new favorite band, were gone. I
was mightily upset.

Somehow, though, I managed to
pull the pieces of my life together and
go on. Eighteen months later, Chris
Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, the prin-
cipal songwriters of Squeeze, came
out with a new record. Expectations
ran high. Difford and Tilbrook,
however, turned out to be a snoozer.
I went back to bed. .

Nevertheless, when word broke last
spring that Squeeze had re-formed, my

I response was enthusiastic. Keyboard

great Jules Holland, who had not

played on Squeeze’s latter records, .

was back with the band; Difford and
Tilbrook were excited about the new
material; and the advance single,
“Last Time Forever,” was
tremendous.

But now the suspense is over, and
I am pleased to announce that
Squeeze’s new album has been worth
the wait. Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti not only
brings Squeeze back to the days of
Argybargy and their best songwriting
but advances them to the innovative
forefront of modern production

A clear winner

THE HEAT
Nona Hendryx
RCA

Amid the glamour queens of soul,
Nona Hendryx never really was a
standout, nor. was she the commercial
success some of her peers proved to
be. But what she does have is a raw
talent —- a voice as gritty as it is
steamy. When she sings, fans listen,
critics notice.

Her fourth solo album, appropriate-
ly and simply titled The Heat, probably
won’t garner her any Top 40 records,
but when this lady turns on the steam,
she can be very hot. The Heat begins
with two mediocre cuts: “Revolu-
tionary Dance,” a kind of soul chant,
and “A Girl Like That,” the Ellie
Greenwich collaboration. Just give her
time to warm up.

Hendryx ignites on side two with ‘‘If
Looks Could Kill” and the slightly less
fiery “Flock This House.” Her dance-

  Squeeze: effortless,
  joyful, clever and fun

technique.
The first thing you notice is that the

‘ band has reinstated its famous vocal

trick, which has been largely aban-
doned on East Side Story and Sweets
From a Stranger. Tilbrook sings
through the verses by himself, but

when the melody reaches a crucial

point (usually the chorus), Difford
jumps in, singing the same melody as
Tilbrook but an octave lower. The two
voices blend and form that one
strange, buzzing “Squeeze” voice, the
band’s trademark. It’s a very original
and effective gimmick.

It is only one obvious characteristic,
however, of a band with seemingly in-
exhaustible invention. The music
stands on its own, with a newly
sophisticated construction that belies
much intelligence and care. These
songs were not thrown together. The
winding melody of “Last Time
Forever,” for example, rivals Len-
non/McCartney compositions in its
graceful complexity. Other songs,
such as “King George Street,” ‘‘I
Learned How to Pray” and “Hits of the
Year” take jarring and delightful twists
and turns as they give the word
“hook” new meaning.

The lyrics cover traditional Squeeze
territory — from go-ahead-and-leave-
me laments to domestic drama, with
husbands on drinking sprees (“King
George Street”), what to do for a
hangover (‘‘I Won't Ever Go Drinking
Again(?)”) and the occasional light
political comment (“Heartbreaking

floor winners in the past — songs like
‘‘I Sweat” and “Keep It Confidential”
— were half heavy on rhythm and half
sensitive, yet altogether successful.
Similar cuts here, like “Time” and
“The Heat, Part I,” may not be as
melodic, but this time around Hendryx
reaches for a harder sound and a
tougher edge. The only problem,
though, lies not in her delivery but in
the fact that most of the songs on The
Heat are too long and drawn out. _
A good example of that is the ballad
“I Need Love,” which is otherwise a
painful, beautifully worded and careful-
ly delivered song. With ‘‘I Need Love,”
she’s at her. simplest and most
vulnerable: I need love/ love will get me

- through the night. It’s the best cut from

the album where Hendryx stands up to
newcomers like Shannon and Whitney
Houston (and even to old pros like
Aretha Franklin, Joan Armatrading and
Tina Turner) and comes out of the bat-
tle a clear winner.

World,” “Hits of the World”). All are
filled with good-naturedly sarcastic,
middle-class English charm.

In terms of experimentation, Cosi
Fan Tutti Frutti is the band’s most
adventurous record to date. Only a few
of the tracks resemble what could be
called typical Squeeze songs. The ma-
jority of -the numbers feature some in-
novation — the swirling synthesizer
undercurrent in “No Place Like
Home,” for instance- Jules Holland
manages to put his personality into
everything he plays, especially the
striking piano breaks in “Last Tim
Forever.” '

This experimentation, however, can
occasionally be cited as a flaw. The
vocal lines at times become muddled,

The ABC’s of disco

HOW TO BE A ZILLIONAIRE
ABC -
Mercury Records

From the press release accompany-
ing ABC’s How To Be A Zi/lionaire one
would think the band has totally re-
invented its sound.-What ABC has ac-
tually done is to record an unabashed
disco album which usually sparkles but
sometimes drones. - -

At its worst, How To Be A Zi/lionaire
presents music suitable for little more
than aerobic workouts. “So Hip It
Hurts” and “Vanity Kills,” with their
weightless electronic drumming and
bland keyboard parts, offer little more
than a steady beat. ' _

But ABC does provide excitement
on other tracks. The cool horn effects
and propulsive rhythms of “15 Storey
Halo” make it kick, and “A To Z,”
featuring a short rap by each band
member and a kazoo-like synth part,
has a fun sound. The album’s most
textured pieces seem to work best,
and the chiming keyboard runs of
“Ocean Blue” and “Be Near Me” add
to their listenability.

Singer Martin Fry obviously likes the-
sounds of words and concocts in-
teresting rhymes in many songs. But
his political posturings on “Between
You And Me” aren’t terribly effective,
and his recurring warnings against the
trappings of vanity and elitism grow tir-
ing. One is better off enjoying the
smooth vocal delivery of Martin Fry
and the attention-grabbing vocals on
much of the album than examining
Fry’s poetry.

With theircartoon caricatures on the
record sleeve, comedic posturings in

-the “Be Near Me” video and often
times odd subjects for the lyrics of their

songs, it’s difficult to take ABC very

as in “Big Beng," ‘‘I Won’t Go Drink- 

ing Again(?)” and the middle section
of “King George Street.” And even
Holland can get carried away — some
of his improvisations are just plain
weird.

In all, though, Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti is
a rich listening experience. Where
most groups these days spend the
bulk of their time in the hair salon,
Squeeze actually takes the trouble to
sit down and write well-constructed
songs. The result is music that is
everything modern pop should be: ef-
fortless, joyful, clever and, above all,
fun.

I STEPHEN MORRISON,

seriously. So after investing in their
latest album, just sit back and relax as
their catchy dance songs demonstrate

meandering
SUSAN SLEEPWALKING

The Arms "Of Someone New
Office Records

. Grammy Nominee: “Best Album to

Play While Experimenting With
Drugs.” - ‘ ‘
Susan Sleepwalking, by The -Arms of
Someone New, is not an album to add
to your burgeoning party-album collec-
tion. This albumis a Valium with
grooves. The Champaign, ll|., band

' proves that psychedelic, drug-induced

meandering is alive and well in
America’s heartland. And it is a
welcome relief. There are no
messages for today’s youth or pleas to

feed the starving of the world. No, this ._
album has nothing to say and says it

well.

The album begins inconspicuously
enough with its $1.98 drum machine
rhythm and ambient, melancholy
organ sound, suggesting a collabora-
tion between The Soul Sonic Force
and Brian Eno. But Susan Sleepwalk-
ing diverges from both extremes and

It occurs to me that I have
been increasingly verbose during
the past few editions of this
loathsome little column. This
week’s installment is a direct
reaction against this trend: In-
stead of seven or eight windy
diatribes and hyperbolizations
that go on for sentence after
sentence with no real point other

gthan to glorify my fondness for
scouring the depths of» my

-vocabulary. The bits this week ,

are more numerous and more
laconic — to the point, that is.

‘ this song, you get the impression that
Bam Bam want to be U2 real bad.
Then the vocal comes in, and you
realize they also want to be Def Lep-
pard. The two styles collide and
mayhem ensues. The result is a poor
imitation of the Michael Stanley Band.

The Clash: This is England
This song goes directly against

everything that all the nitwits who to-
_ day call themselves punks are suppos-

‘-tied to stand for. There is no hoarse

yelling or nihilism, and it’s not a muddy
cacophony. It is sober, intelligent, pas-

By David Zuchowski '

Perhaps one of the city's best
musical events of any’ genre — one
designed to titillate both the eye and ,
the ear, a visual and auditory ex-
travaganza -— is scheduled for Sun-

day, Oct. 27, at 8 p.m. The scene: or-

program consists of “Catulli Carmina”
by Carl Orff, a composition so in-

teresting, so gripping, so absolutely

enthralling and, yes, so strangely
beautiful that the mere mention of a
live performance here in Pittsburgh
sets my ears drooling.

But if that weren’t enough, the
Mendelssohn _Choir of Pittsburgh will
perform it. Not only that, but Robert
Page, one of America's premier choral
conductors, will lead the choir. Page
won a Grammy Award for his recording
of “Catulli Carmina” with the
Philadelphia Orchestra, and I expect,
given the credentials of the
Mendelssohn Choir, a brilliant rendi-
tion on Sunday night, one well worth
both the time and the expense (ticket
prices are between $3 and $12).

“Catul|i Carmina” is a gripping, pas-
sionate work of the love poems of
Catullus set to music and sung in
Latin. The piece is so mesmerizing that
it has a universal appeal. There’s not
a boring moment in'the whole piece.

The Duquesne University Tamburit-
zans will join the Mendelssohn Choir

by for Emil Cossetto’s “Ladarke.” The

Tamburitzans, if you didn’t know, are
a singing, playing and dancing
40-member ensemble decked out in
authentic eastern European garb, per-

nate, opulent Carnegie Music Hall. The

definitely not. As for the war between

1 Joe Strummer and Mick Jones (which,

if you don’t know about it, is too com-
plicated to explain briefly), it appears
that Strummer is the victor in round
one + this song blows Big Audio
Dynamite out of the water in sheer
songwriting power. The Clash are still
the only band that can get away with
direct political statements because
they can make them artfully. And no
one embodies rage and commitment
like Joe Strummer. This is the real
thing.

The Miracle Legion: The Backyard

Now this is the way to put a song
together: a fluid, engaging melody,
strong, heartfelt singing, a killer chord
progression and a great chorus. No
frills, no pretension, just rock-solid
songwriting and good, clean playing.
I want to hear more from this band.

Oingo Boingo: Weird Science

A standard Oingo Boingo romp —
that means it’s catchy, riveting and
danceable. This group has long since
settled on its sound and has stuck to
it, though leader Danny Elfman proved
on his So-Lo lp that it is essentially his
sound. For some reason, the band’s
anti-corporate beliefs do not seem con-
tradicted by having recorded a song
written expressly for a movie.'They’re
probably amused by the irony. Like
most Oingo Boingo songs, “Weird
Science” goes on a little too long, but
no matter.‘ It's great modern

group plays over 120 concert dates
each season and has appeared in vir-
tually every famous concert hall of
practically every major city in the con-

_ tinental United States. The troupe has
- also made nine foreign tours covering

26 countries.

Rounding out the evening will be
Dominick Argento’s ‘‘I Hate and I
Love,” again Catullus’ poems but this
time sung in English and, of course, by
a different composer. Ticket holders
will be entitled to a dinner discount of
15 percent at the Park Schenley and

performance. _

The Mendelssohn Choir was started
in 1908 by combining the Apollo
Chorus, the Mozart Club and the Pitts-
burgh Male Chorus, which joined the
Ladies Choir in 1914. In 1916 the choir
presented the Verdi Requiem with
Walter Damrosch and the New York

Symphony, -conducted by Dr. Ernest '

Lunt. Other conductors have included

- Henry Mazer, Dr. Hugh Johnson,

Chester O’Bannon and currently Page.

Quality singing is required by the
choir, one of the oldest choral groups
in the nation. The group consists of
130 volunteer singers and a core of 24

paid professionals. The volunteers -

must be dedicated to their music. In
addition to having 26 regular Wednes-
day night rehearsals, 17 special
rehearsals and 18 separate perfor-

mances that involve a lot of spare time, ,

the members must pay dues, adhere
to exact dress requirements and must
even fill out an absence request slip for
each rehearsal conflict. At the end of

Sharp and Numan: Change Your Mind

For those of you who have been los-

Numan’s been up to these days, fret
no longer. He's been perfecting his off-

completely unbearable. “Change Your

I’m tempted to write one). Gloss-o,

Jane Siberry: One More Color

Right now this is only available in
Canada, but when Windham Hill gets
around to releasing it down here, you'll
probably hear a lot of it. As Siberry’s
songs go, “One More Color” is ex-

‘ tremely commercial and glossy, but it’s

wonderful. The melody mounts hook
upon hook over a lush electronic
acoustic backdrop with daredevil preci-
sion and seeming ease. There is more
to the Great White North than Rush
and Loverboy. Take the trouble and
get a copy of this (and while you’re up
there, get me some Molson).

the coming year — in front of Page,

Take a minute. Take a few and look
at the footwear of the person closest
to you. What a person wears on his
feet can tell you a great deal about that
person. Most people wear sneakers
around campus and take great pride
in their sneakers. Sneakers adopt a
very personal relationship with a per-
son’s feet that cannot be surpassed by
anything else. in some extreme cases,
sneakers not only have a close rela-
tionship with a person’s feet, but they
actually become the person’s feet.

There are several types of sneaker
wearers that are easily recognizable.
Each kind of wearer wants you to
notice his footwear but without telling
you about it. There are several
methods incorporated by the wearer to
accomplish this task. Leaving the laces

of other people are all ways to bring
wanted attention to your feet.

Those who wear Air Jordans are
usually seen strutting their stuff
wherever they go. I would, too, if i
spent $75 on a pair of sneakers. it's
funny that you rarely see these “hoop
shoes” on the court where they were
meant to be.

Ever see those guys whose
sneakers look as if they were just
pulled out of the box? Sure you have.
You know that these guys have had
the same pair of sneaks for over two
and a half years, but they still look
brand new. This is an effort that must
be actively pursued every day because
one rainy day might make a smudge
on the side of a perfect pair of
sneakers.

Then there are those who go beyond
both Air Jordans and the “ever new”

‘ look. They are the sneaks that are so

high tech that you need instructions to
get into them. They’re usually high
tops. They have a multiple cross-

steppin’ out

sectional-support-protective-quadra-
dimension lacing system. “Lacing
system?” Sure fellas. What ever hap-
pened to the good old Converse Chuck
Taylor model? What I really like about
these sneakers is that the wearers are
convinced that they need all that gar-
bage. Nice velcro, guys. Oh yeah, I
forgot to mention that Adidas will be in-
troducing a running shoe with a com-
puter chip in the heel to relay vital in-
formation to the wearer. This is going
to far. 

Well, now that I brought up runners,
I might as well discuss them. You know
that they’re runners because they are
the only ones who wear running shoes
all of the time. Another giveaway is the
T-shirt that says they finished in the top
500 of the “Ultraman” marathon that

. they ran last week. Runners only wear

the stuff so you’ll ask them if they are
runners. Then they answer, “Sort of.”

I McCallum an aircraft carrier in
the Naval Academy’s small ﬂeet

" A...

45.1‘ '

\V

Navy head coach Gary Tranquill has
one aircraft carrier in his ﬂeet. It is
named the U.S.S. McCallum, as in
Napolean McCallum. Pitt fans will
remember McCallum two years ago for
his 172-yard rushing performance
against Pitt. Football fans may best
recall him for having his picture on the

cover of Sports Illustrated ’s football

preview earlier in the year. Regardless,
he is currently ranked third in the na-

tion in all-purpose running, averaging .

194.3 yards per game, and he poses a
deﬁnite threat to Pitt’s defense.

“I really wasn’t sure how good he
was two years ago when we played
them,” said Pitt head coach Foge
Fazio. “Then I saw Bill Maas, Troy
Benson, Troy Hill and Tom Flynn hit
him and he just kept going forward.”
Fazio added, “From that day on, I’ve
voted for him for every possible award
I could. He will be the" best back we
face, to date, this season.”

Earlier in the season, McCallum may
have been a mismatch against the Pitt
defense, but not any more. The Pitt
defense has steadily improved and has
seemingly wiped out’ some early season
problem spots. Pitt is currently
ranked second in the nation in rushing
defense, allowing an average of only
56.1 yards per game. It is a classic
matchup, and McCallum is Tranquill’s ,
ticket to success. The Navy head coach

Tennis team
looks to top
last year’s
performance

at Villanova

By Greg Ficery
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther tennis team leaves
this afternoon for the Big East Con-
ference Championships at Villanova
with their best chance in four years of
ﬁnishing out of last place and gaining
some respect among a group of peren-
nially strong teams. _

Heading into the Championships,
eight out of nine Big East teams sport
winning records, including Pitt, and
three are undefeated in dual match
play.

Although Syracuse won the event last
year, and ﬁve out of six years since the
Big East was formed in 1979, Boston
College is emerging as the narrow
favorite to stop the Orangewomen for
the second time, as they did in 1980.
B.C.’s No. 1 player, Katie Molumphy,
is the reigning Big East champion, and
in the East Coast Athletic Conference
tournament played this fall, the Lady
Eagles ﬁnished fourth while Syracuse
placed eighth.

Syracuse coach Jim Dwyer is a lit-
tle more concerned this year than he’s

sitting out last year with a broken
ankle, is up to the challenge.

“He has performed very well all
year for us,” explained Tranquill,
referring to McCallum’s 664 yards
rushing. “He’s back in the groove.”
Tranquill added, ‘ ‘We feel we have to
run on them. When you have to pass,
that is when they are at their best.”

One thing Navy may not want to do A

is throw the ball. Quarterback Bill
Byme shined last year at Pitt Stadium,
throwing for 340 yards against the Pan-
thers in a 28-28 tie, but he has not been
as impressive this year.

“Bill Byrne had a great fourth
quarter against Pitt last year,” con-
ceeded Tranquill, “but he has not been
as sharp this year as we thought he
would. Hopefully he has his conﬁdence
back.” '

Byme has completed close to 49 per-
cent of his passes (76 of 156) for 938
yards and six touchdowns this season.
Last year, through eight games, Byrne
threw 11 touchdown passes while pass-
ing .for 1,425 yards.

As a team, the Midshipmen have
outscored their opponents this year 147
to 126, but that statistic is not reﬂected
in their record. Navy is 2-4.

“It’s very frustrating,” Tranquill
said. “We lost three games in a row
[to North Carolina, Delaware and In-
diana] by a totalof eight points early
in the season. There was always

 Pitt teams prepare for stiff

been in the past. “It used to be a _two
team tournament,” ‘said Dwyer. “But
the Big East is starting to become a lit-
tle more competitive, which is good. ”

Dwyer is also wary of being the .

defending-champion because he feels
that everyone will be gunning for his
Orangewomen. “I’m a little worried
about upsets,” Dwyer impressed.
“There’s nothing a player would like
more than to beat one of our players.’ ’

Talk about Hoya Paranoia. In any
case, having played a schedule that in-
cluded national powerhouses such as
Florida and Texas should ease the
Orangewomen’s fears. -

Speaking of the Hoyas, Georgetown
is currently 8-0 and is led by 1983 Big
East Champion, Cathy Federici. The
Hoyas, along with an improving Prov-
idence team, will be a factor, but
neither team should be strong enough
to threaten for the title.

Thus, a duel is arising between two
of the powers in eastern women’s ten-
nis for the top billing in the conference.
However, there is no telling how the
remainder of the teams will fall into
place. '

The format of the tournament is such

_ that the luck of the draw should be a

major factor in determining each
team’s fate. For each singles player and
doubles team, a separate tournament
(ﬂight) will be played. A win in the
main draw of any of the nine ﬂights
earns a team two points, while a win
in a consolation round scores one point.
There are four seeded players in each
ﬂight, based on available information,
and the rest are drawn at random.
Herein lies the key to a potentially high
point total come Sunday afternoon.
“It’s just logical that if we can play

Press Box

something that brought us down.”
Tranquill added, “We’re just trying to
get everything together right now.”

Navy is making some progress
towards that objective. The Mid-
shipmen have won two out their last
three, with the loss going to Air Force,
a nationally ranked team. Maybe the
Midshipmen are ready to turn the
corner. 1'

“It’s going to take a great effort on
our part,” Tranquill said, recognizing
the difference between the Pitt team he
faced last year and the one he will face
on Saturday.

As for Pitt, Fazio will make due with
what he has. Injuries have taken their
toll on the Pitt lineup, and Fazio will
have to make due with one healthy, ex-
perienced tailback, Charles Gladman.

“Charles says the more he carries

. the ball, the stronger he gets,” Fazio

said. “I hope he is strong as heck on
Saturday.”

Game Notes: Pitt is without Brian
Davis and Zeke-Gadson at tailback.
Davis has a bruised quadricep muscle
and Gadson has a seperated shoulder.
 A sellout crowd of over 30,000 fans
is expected, including 4,500 Pitt fans
who are making the trip.  There is
no live television coverage of the game.
 Gladman is ahead of McCallum in
yards rushing, averaging 115.8 yards
per game. McCallum is averaging
110.7 yards per game rushing.

St. John’s more often than B.C. we’re
going to have a better chance at win-
ning some matches,” Lady Panther
-coach George Dieffenbach said.
“We’ll have to have a few upsets and
then really take advantage of our easier
draws to be successful.”

Although No. 1 player Miriam Goltz
has been spectacular as of late for the
Lady Panthers, Dieffenbach feels that
his team’s strength from top to bottom
will be its greatest asset in a team for-
mat such as this. >

‘ ‘We’re not an outstanding team, but

“Stephanie Nelson, Carrie de Vera,
and Kris Peckman have accumulated a
lot of points for us at three, four, and

more signiﬁcant at the top.”

The goal for the Lady Panthers, as
put by Dieffenbach, is “just to ﬁnish
out of last place.” In summing up his
team’s chances, Dieffenbach said,
‘ ‘There are some overpowering teams
and some exceptional players in the Big

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

‘It is fall in Pittsburgh and that means
one thing. Trees have turned from their
summer green to bright and vivid
shades of orange, red and yellow.

Schenley Park is alive these days with '

the beautiful colors of fall.

If you look closely you will notice
a few extra colors popping out among
the fall shades. These colors just ‘hap-
pen tobe blue and gold. Wherever you
look in the park these days you always
see that familar blue and gold.

While some of the fall colors might
blend together, the blue and gold Pitt
track team sweatshirts deﬁnitely stand
out. The Pitt cross country team has
been spending an endless number of
hours running the trails of Schenley
Park in preparation for the Big East
Championship, which will be held this
weekend at Boston’s Franklin Park”.

“The Big East is an excellent cross
country conference,” said head coach

John Vasvary. “Everybody has been
working hard getting ready for it. We

have a young team, but I think we can 

do all right.” ‘

The Lady Panthers will rely on the A '1
talent and speed of junior Lori Wood‘;  '
to set the pace. In her first year of com- ‘

petition for the Lady Panthers, Wood
ﬁnished ﬁrst in all the meets.

“We will ﬁnd out how good Lori is if

at the Big East,” Vasvary said. “She

really has not been challenged yet, so . »

this should let us know what she can
do‘)?

The Lady Panthers, who are 3-1 with
a ﬁrst place ﬁnish at the Faimiont State
Invitational, will also count on senior
Amy DiFrancesco andifreshman Han-
nah Russell to aid the team in becom-
ing a contender. ~

“Amy has made a lot of im-
provements,” Vasvary said. She is do-
ing the things we thought she could do.

“Our biggest problem is that there
is too much of a split from the No. 1
to the No. 5 runner. They have to ﬁnish
closer to each other. There is a two-
and-a-half to three minute split between
the one and ﬁve runners.”

While that may be aproblem for the
women’s team, it is not one forthe

men’s team. The split between the No. -

l and No. 7 runner is less than a
minute. .

“That is the key,” Vasvary said.‘

  When

victorlnugo shoots, the

ball usually goes in the net

By Shelly Ranus
For The Pitt News

‘ ‘You can have all the bloody
superstars in the world, but if you don ’t
have a few unselﬁsh players willing to
run their tails oﬁ‘, you ’re going to get
beat. ”
— Eddie Firmani,
NY Cosmos Coach

PITTSBURGH — In the midst of the
University of Pittsburgh soccer team
practice, as players run down the ﬁeld
making leaping kicks and precision
passes, there stands one player who
seems to go unnoticed. Suddenly the
ball comes his way and he’s off, charg-
ing full speed toward the goal. He
unleashes a stinging shot that misses the
net by mere inches. A look of deter-
mination settles on his face as he awaits
another chance..

For senior Victor Hugo that is what
soccer, and life, are all about —— deter-
mination and an overwhelming desire
to win. »

“My dad used to tell me a saying of
Vince Lombardi’s that I honestly try
to live by,” Hugo said. “Winners
never quit and quitters never win.”

Hugo, a forward from Arlington,
Va., looks like a throwback to the
Lombardi era. His knees are scarred,

his bones have been broken and he
plays hurt much of the time. It is the
intensity, however, that is most
reminiscent of the football great.
Whether playing in an important game
or just in practice, Hugo always gives
his all.

“Maybe I try to win too much. I
want to win everything,” Hugo ex-

plained. “I’m not a good loser. Ithink P

if you show me a good loser, I’ll show
you a loser. Something should always
bother you about losing.”

Losing is not a familiar item with
Hugo. Before coming to Pitt, he not
only excelled at soccer, but was also
a huge success at lacrosse and ice
hockey. In his senior year at Canter-
bury Prep, Hugo was chosen to the All-
New England team for all three sports.
He sometimes wonders what would
have happened if he had concentrated
on only one sport.

“When I see players who have
played only soccer, I sometimes
wonder what type of player I could
have been if I had done the same
thing,” Hugo mused. “I’m happy,
though, with the things I have done. I
really enjoyed all three sports and am
glad I got a chance to participate in
them.”

When it came time to choose a col-
lege, Hugo decided to go to a school
that offered him an excellent education
as well as an outstanding sports pro-

gram. He was uncertain about which
sport to concentrate on, but after look-
ing at Pitt and its soccer team he reached
a quick decision.

“I came here to play soccer and to
get an education,” Hugo explained. “I
wanted to major in business administra-
tion and Pitt has a good reputation for
its business program both at the
undergraduate and graduate level. They
have done a lot of work with the Ar-
my. And my father, being in the
military, had heard of their reputa-
tion.”

Hugo’s father, a general in the Ar-
my, has had a good deal of inﬂuence
on his son’s life. The values he instilled
in Hugo at an early age have directed
his son in academics and sports. Much
of the younger Hugo’s determination
had developed through his father’s
teachings. ‘

“My family has always been very
close and supportive. My parents have
never pushed me, they have always
supported me in athletics,” Hugo said.
“Probably their only regret is not
being able to see me play very much
since they’ve been overseas. When
they are home my mom and dad always
try to come and see me no matter how
far apart we are.

“They have tried to instill in me the
importance of doing well academical-
ly. They realize that while you’re play-
ing ball in college it’s hard to get a 4.0,

The Pitt News, October 25, 1985

but my parents have" conﬁdence in ‘me.’
‘They know I work hard and do the best
I can.”

Coach Joe Luxbacher also has con-
fidence in Hugo. He looks to the four-
year starter to provide leadership and
emotion to the Panther squad. Lux-
bacher has been able to use Hugo’s
considerable athletic talents by playing
him at various positions on the field.
This year, however, Hugo has found
a home as a forward.

“Vic is a key player for us. You
need a player who is able to spark other
players and Vic is that type of player, ”

-Luxbacher commented. “He always

plays really hard and you never need
to get him ready to play. When the
whistle blows, he’s ready to go.

‘ ‘He’s a team leader in that way. He
may not yell a lot, but the way he plays
is an inspiration to the other players.
Vic’s hard work up front is very im-
portant to us. A lot of times he may not
get all the credit because he doesn’t
score the goal, but often it’s his hard
work that made the goal possible.”

For Hugo, the only credit he needs

is his own sense of satisfaction from-
doing the best he can. His strong sense
of determination keeps him always
striving to play the next game‘ better
than the one before. When the game is
over, though, Hugo likes to put it all -
in perspective and move on to new
challenges.
_ “I feel like I have grown up a lot
over the past four years,” Hugo said.
“I realized a poise in myself that I
didn’t have before, in my ability to get
along with people and my ability to
make the best of a tough situation.
Usually I try to look on the bright side
of things.”

other. What we need right now is
somebody who can break out ahead of
everybody and really take control.”
The Panther men’s cross country
team, which is 2-1 with first place
ﬁnishes at_ the California University and
Fairmont State Invitationals, will be
looking to leaders such as John
Thomas, Joel Ninos, Bob Weiner,
Mike Doll and Ken Picciano to help the
team ﬁnish better than last year’s

, seventh place.

“This is the best team since I have
been here and in a number of years,”
Vasvary commented. “The Big East is
tough. But we have the guys who can
handle that.” .

“John Thomas is a much better and
more aggressive runner this season. He
IS willing to challenge up front. He
doesn’t sit back. Mike Doll is a gutsy
runner. He doesn’t have a lot of speed,
but boy is he tough. He is a real leader.

“We have the talent, now what we
need is penetration. We need. that one
guy that other teams have who can get
ahead, who can split the front-runners
in the pack, in order to piece it all
together. We need somebody who
might break loose.” '

Both the Panthers and Lady Panthers
are hoping the Big East Championship
will be their time to break loose.

Soccer team hosts Redmenas it

I‘ By Theresa Varley

For The Pitt News

When the Panther soccer team takes
the ﬁeld at Pitt Stadium tomorrow at
1:30 p.m. there will be a lot on the line.
The Panthers have a Big East match-
up against St. John’s, and a victory
over the tough Redmen team will
almost assure the Panthers a spot in the
Big East Championships.

Beating the Redmen will not be easy.
Both teams are undefeated in con-

 ference play with Pitt having a 3-0

record while St. John’s is 2-0. In Big

‘ East action, Pitt defeated Georgetown
(3-O), Villanova (2-1) and Seton Hall
(4-2). The Redmen defeated Villanova
(1-0) and Georgetown (1-0).

“St. John’s is a very strong team,”
said head coach Joe Luxbacher. “They

Ierry Rubin

have a strong defense, a lot like West
Virginia (who the Panthers tied, 0-0). ”

The Pitt defense will have to be as
tough as they have been in the last few
weeks in order to hold off the strong
Redmen offensive attack.

“St. John’s is a well-skilled team,”
Luxbacher said. “They are scoring
enough to win. They’ll be ready to play
and we have to be ready, too.”

The Redmen, who are currently
10-2-1, have recorded nine shutouts
this season while the Panthers have
recorded eight. The Redmen have.
outscored their opponents 27-6 and the
Panthers have outscored their op-
ponents 25-8. The Panther’s leading
scorers are forward Vic Hugo with
five goals and six assists, and Mike
Grimes with three goals and assists.

F looks to secure spot in Big East

The Redmen’s leading scorers are mid-
ﬁelder Neil Doorley with six goals and
three assists, and Joey Krische with
three goals and seven assists.

The Panthers, who are 9-2-1 , are
coming off a disappointing 3-0 loss to
Penn State. The Nittany Lions, who are
11-5 on the season, were too strong for
the Panthers.

“They outplayed us in every facet of
the game,” said Luxbacher. “The
most disappointing part was that we did
not play with intensity. We did not have
full effort by all 11 players. Some of
them just went through the motions.

“You can accept a loss if you played
hard, but when you don’t, it’s hard to
accept it. We just have to regroup now.
We have to look ahead to St. John’s
and not dwell on Penn State.”

By Jim Brueckner

Rock and classical music combine to offer description of hockey

Being a fan of both types,.I had
always wondered what a marriage of
classical music and rock ‘n’ roll would
be like. I knew that if there were a way
to interlock the two very different, but
equally appealing art forms, the result
would be magniﬁcent. '

Lo and behold, I found out that just
such a marriage had already taken
place, and it involved two of my
favorites. I discovered an album entr-
tled “Arthur Fiedler and the Boston

Pops Play the Beatles.” I was not -

disappointed. It is one of my favorite
albums.

Ice hockey is one of my favorite
sports for a very different, yet similar
reason. Think about it. _

Hockey is part Bruce Springsteen
and part George Gershwin, part John
Cougar Mellencamp and part Peter
Tchaikovsky.

It has the precision of Beethoven’s
“Fifth Symphony,” and the power of
Billy Idol’s “White Wedding.” It. has
the beauty of Rachman1noff’s “Piano
Concerto No. 2,”- and the energy of
Bryan Adams’ “Summer of '69.”

As a result, the followers of this sport
come from all walks of life. It is a spec-

. tacle for the masses. It attracts the up-

per echelon of society, as well as the
regulars at Joe's Bar ‘n’ Grill.

I have always been a fan of hockey.
It is the manly version of ﬁgure
skating. (Although I also enjoy ﬁgure
skating.)

I have always been fascinated by the
players’ ability to skate and play at top
speed. Flying up the ice at the speeds
of these players and passing the puck
to a teammate, with such precision that
he doesn’t even break stride, is truly
an incredible feat. Considering that
there are ﬁve men trying to prevent you
from accomplishing this task, it
becomes even more impossible. It
wouldn't be so bad if these men were
passing the puck with their hands, but
to pass it by hitting it with a stick while
your teammate has to catch it with a
stick, and driving it through all that
speeding trafﬁc  impressive.

Let’s put itthis way. There you are,
standing behind your own‘ goalie’s net.
As you take the puck out, ﬁve men
from the other team are watching your
every move. One or two may attack
you at any time from any angle. You
begin to move up the ice at speeds ap-
proaching 20 or possibly 25 mph. Try
driving a car at 20-25 mph and see just
how fast these men are moving when
they are executing these precision
passes. Now imagine that while you are
skating at these speeds, you attempt to
use a stick to hit a little black disk
through a maze of nine other bodies to
one man from your team, who must
stop this disk by lightly tapping it with
his stick. All the while, there are the
other players who are attempting to
block the path between you and your
teammate. If you are successful, con-

gratulations. But now the whole pro-
cess starts over as your teammate at-

tempts a pass. Just think, this play hap-_

pens _literally millions of times over the
course of one year.

It is this speed and precision that
makes hockey a beautiﬁil sport. But un-
fortunately, many people shy away
from hockey because of a little
ugliness.

Unfortunately, (for them), some peo-
ple have wrong _impressions about
hockey because of the ﬁghts. As I have
said before, I hate when people watch
hockey just for the ﬁghts, but NOT
watching it just because of the ﬁghts
is far worse.

The fact that this is the only sport that
does not have automatic expulsion for
ﬁghting has these people thinking that
ﬁghting is considered part of the game
and therefore that ﬁghts take place all
the time in every game.

I don’t know if this stat is readily
available, but I'll have to check. Ofall
the games thatl saw last season, I’d say
that about 75-80 percent had only one
ﬁght or no ﬁghts at all. In fact, I’d bet
that possibly as many as 50 percent of
the g_ames were ﬁght-free.

If you are wondering why hockey
allows ﬁghting while other sports
don’t, it is because of the sticks. In the
game of hockey, the speed of play and
the pressure of needing to think and
react with split-second accuracy create
an intensity that is unmatched by any

other team sport. With this type of in-
tensity, tempers have. a much higher
probability of ﬂaring. The need for
ﬁghting lies in the fact that you have
a high probability for a man’s temper
ﬂaring while he is holding onto a
hockey stick. This is not to say that
these men are all maniacs who attack
to kill every time someone rufﬂes their
feathers. But actually, allowing ﬁghting
is just playing it safe. You read it cor-
rectly, ﬁghting is playing it safe!

Come on! Be honest, You know how
ridiculous nine out of 10 fights in the
NHL are. Two men brieﬂy lose their
temper and swing wild roundhouse
punches and if they’re lucky, they
might land one. A player who is able
to land three or possibly even four, is
hailed as the new Muhammad Ali.
These ﬁghts are funnier than they are
dangerous. The Three Stooges are
more violent than the average hockey
ﬁght.

Hockey is in reality a lot less violent
than its reputation would have us
believe. Sure, there is a lot of
roughhousing and intimidating going
on, but that’s part of all team sports.
Don’t be naive.

Mostly, hockey is the beautiful sport
that I described earlier. Players like
Dave “The Hammer” Schultz have
been the exception, while players like
Guy Laﬂeur have been the rule.

It comes from Canada, a country

-whose landscape is more beautiful than

perhaps any other country in the world.
Their national anthem, “Oh Canada”
is not only the most beautiful of all an-
thems, it is a beautiful song, period.

Yes, a marriage between classical
music and rock ‘n’ roll is an accurate
way to describe hockey.

The way that the crowd is buzzing
throughout the game and then explodes
when the home team scores is much
like the crescendo, while the checking
along the boards and in front of the net,
along with the rowdiness of the crowd,
is similar to the atmosphere of a rock
concert.

Hockey is an interesting and diverse
sport. Therein lies the attraction. It is
something different. It has the elegance
of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the
eniotion of Stevie Nicks.

Considering the disadvantage the
Lady Panthers have in facing this type
of competition without any scholarship
players, they would certainly deserve
one.
