Skaters

stuff at
contest

By Marc Duchin

Assistant News Editor

Yesterday, skateboarders got
a chance to show off their skill
and to compete against one

Hillman Library.

The contest was sponsored
by a Pittsburgh promotional
company, Fairytale Produc-
tions, inc.

”People have been blowing
skaters off,” said Kevin Popvic,
executive director of Fairytale
Productions. ”They’ve got Lit-
tle League and swimming
pools, but there are not too
many things for skateboards.”

Popvic said that his compa-
ny has been sponsoring skate-
board contests since last
March.

”Me and my partner skate.
We've been skating for 14
years,” he said.

The contest involved a ser-
ies of ramps and obstacles ‘on
which competitors skated and
were judged. First—place and
second—place winners were
awarded trophies.

Popvic said that he was
generally satisfied with the
turnout, ”Considering a late
start in advertising and a lot of
weather concerns, we still did
pretty well,” he said.

Popvic went on to say he
hopes that there will be more
events for skateboarders.

Pitt ROTC a mixture of good, bad, ugly

By David Ballarotto
Staff Writer

They experience the adventure
of jumping out of airplanes.

They experience the fun of din-
ing in and the unpleasant taste of
the grog bowl. '

They experience the satisfac-
tion of a college scholarship.

They experience the pride in
serving and defending the Unit-
ed States of America.

They are the soldiers and
nurses of the U.S. Army's Reserve
Officer Training Corps.

The ROTC program is offered
to students of the University-of
Pittsburgh, with campus head-
quarters on the 29th floor of the
Cathedral of Learning.

According to Lt.’ Colonel
Donald P. Kirchoffner, professor

of military science at Pitt, the
ROTC program is nothing new in
Oakland. A

i ’’I think ROTC has been here
since the early 1900s,” Kirchoff-
ner said.

The program has been at Pitt to
commission the future leadership
of the United States Army — to
manufacture tomorrow’-s Patton,
Eisenhower and Sherman. T‘

According to Kirchoffner,
ROTC has a lucrative scholarship
program. ”[We have] 40 students
on full-tuition scholarships, $195
book fee and $100 a month.” He
added, ”Juniors and seniors get a
$100 month fee.”

Kirchoffner said the financial

opportunities of ROTC are what
attracts most students to the pro-
gram. Cadet Maj. Jill Weiskirch-
er, Cadet Capt. Kris ‘Stover and

     

Cadet Lt. Col. Jerry Miller, all
seniors, agreed and said the
scholarships and prospective
benefits, looked interesting.
Stover and Miller said the main
reason they joined was the
scholarship. Although Weiskirch-
er was not awarded a scholar-
ship, sheajoined because she
liked the benefits the Army offers
for nursing. ‘ A
Benefits aside, the ROTC pro-
gram prepares Pitt students to be-
come second lieutenants in the
Army. That means members are
subject to intensive military train-
ing throughout the four-year

 program.

According to Kirchoffner, the
program challenges both the

physical and academic qualities, _
of students. Members must have-
a- GPA of at least 2.5. The mini-

     

mum average for a scholarship is,
for the most part, 2.7.
”We have FTX [field training

exercises] once a month, teach-

ing survival techniques and
smal|—unit |eadership,” explained
Kirchoffner.

Also, students must go through
physical training held at 6:30
a.m. in Trees Hall.

These activities make up ‘the
freshman and sophomore years.
Kirchoffner said the junior year is
when the student is contracted.

”The summer of the junior

year,” Kirchoffner explained,’

”juniors go off to Ft. Bragg, N.C.,
for intense leadership and small-

unit training. There are some_

4,000 cadets from 111 schools.”

NEW YORK — Pope john Paul
II talked more than he listened
during his pastoral_visit' to the
United States, leaving his some-.

ing how much he really heard.

’’It is pretty clear to me that he

”He is hearing what is said, he

David J. O'Brien of Holy Cross

does not understand very well the’
problems that confront the

During a 10-day visit which
ended Saturday, the pope gave

48 speeches, but he also listened‘

to a few from bishops and lay,
leaders as well. .

WASHINGTON — Despite an
agreement in principle o.n a
nuclear arms pact, the United
States and’ the Soviet Union re-

' main divided on two important

provisions and are sending their
experts back to the bargaining
table.

Yet to be resolved are differ-
ences over the timetable for with-
drawal of the intermediate-range

fnuclear missiles covered by the,

agreement and on a set of rules
to prevent violations of the treaty.

After three days of talks, Presi-
dent Reagan announced on Fri-
day that he and Soviet General
Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev
were committed to signing the
treaty" at a summit meeting in the
United States this year but that

team said, ’’I really think the re-
maining issues are the ones in
fine print. The issues are compli-
cated but technical and solva-
ble.” The discussions begin in
Geneva later this month.’

The meat of the agreement is a
pledge by the superpowers to re-
move the nuclear warheads from
all ground-launched missiles in
the 300 mile to 3,400 mile range
and destroy the launching tubes.
The United States has 332 of
these weapons and the Soviet
Union has about 680 of them.

The Soviets want to remove the

Nicaragua’s opposition
newspaper La Prensa to reopen,
Foreign Minister Miguel D’Esco-
to and a partner in the paper said
Sunday.

D’Escoto said in a telephone in-
terview with The Associated
Press in San Jose, Costa Rica, that
the paper, closed June 26, 1986,
wouldbe allowed to resume pub-
lishing immediately without pri-
or censorship.

Carlos Holmann, a partner in
the paper, did not say in a brief
telephone interview when the
paper would reopen.

Holmann said permission to re-
open was the result of a meeting
Saturday of President Daniel

Ortega, Agrarian Reform Minister.

Speaker addresses
Nicaraguan issues

By Lori Kelly
For The Pitt News

On Friday, the Pittsburgh Com-
mittee for Health Rights in Cen-
tral America (P.H.R.C.A.) held a
presentation in Forbes Quad
featuring guest speaker Zelmira
Garcia, who addressed issues
concerning Nicaragua.

The Committee is a local mem-
ber of a national network of cities
that sponsore Nicaraguan com-
munities. For the past three years,
Pittsburgh has funded a child-
care facility in Chaguitillo,
Nicaragua.

A slide show was presented
depicting the recent develop-
ments of the center which is cur-
rently serving 200 children of
farm families in the area.

Chaguitillo is a community
with a population of 2,000, 400
of which are children under the
age of seven. Rapid development
of the area has resulted in em-
ployment increases which have
prompted immediate increases in
the need for ‘day-care facilities.

This year, the Committee
hopes to raise $2,000 to build an
annex to the day-care center to be
used as a pre-school.

Zelmira Garcia, the counselor
for the Embassy of Nicaragua in
Washington, D.C., is in charge of
the sister city program which
links U.S. cities to Nicaraguraun
communities. There are current-
ly 55 sister cities from Washing-

   

     

ton D.C. to Nicaragua. Garcia

mediates and coordinates rela— .

tions within sister city channels.

Garcia spoke briefly on the
need for medical, material, and
educational aid to Nicaragua.
The primary focus of her lecture
was the cessation of military
funding for the Contras and pub-
lic awareness of the political in-
justices committed against
Nicaragua.

”At the same time the Reagan
administration has funded aid to
the contras which resulted in the
deaths
Nicaraguans, the citizens of the
country are showing their support
of Nicaragua through the efforts
ofthe sister city program,” Garcia
said.

She said it is essential that the

U.S. stops interfering in Central‘

American negotiations if peace is
to be obtained.

”The Iran Contra—Gate was the
proof that the Reagan administra-
tion has continuously supported
the Contras, which is what the
people of Nicaragua have been
saying all along,” Garcia said.

She also said that while-

Nicaragua appreciated the efforts
of concerned citizens who have
provided financial, medical, and
manual assistance to those in
need, ”All your work is just a
waste of time and money as long
as the threat of Contra attack ex-
ists for the people of Nicaragua.”

PHILADELPHIA — The Navy knew four

 -_years before the attack on the USS Stark

in the Persian Gulf that its ships were

 unprepared to fight fires during battle, a
 . published report said Sunday.

In 1983, the USS Antrim was crippled

 he by fire when a test missile went awry and

 _ struck the vessel during trials off the Vir-

 C gina coast,_the Philadelphia Inquirer

reported in its Sunday edition. Though

one was an accident and the other was

an attack, the results were the same.
Antrim crew members tried to rescue

 A a man from the wreckage, but the Inquir-

er said the man died after"rescue efforts
were hampered by a shortage of breath-
ing equipment, communication failures
and a lack ofpower tools with which to

 [free him.

The problems aboard the Stark were
nearly identical four years later when the
vessel was struck by two Iraqi missiles
while patrolling the Persian Gulf. The un-
used fuel aboard one of the missiles con-
tributed to the ferocity of the fire, and 37
sailors died in the attack.

”They still didn't correct that problem,”
said Peter Ciopryna Jr., a petty officer in
charge of firefighting aboard the Antrim.
”How many lives do they have to lose be-
fore they figure this stuff out?”

I I K4 K4 14.5105‘

STATE BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED PRESS

A Naval investigation into the Antrim
fire produced more than 200 pages of
documents that read just like the reports
from firefighters aboard the Stark, the
newspaper said.

While the Antrim incident gave the
Navy a clear preview of what it could ex-
pect if a vessel were damaged in a mis-
sile attack, the Inquirer said there is no
indication that the Navy ever acted upon
the Antrim report to improve firefighting
capabilities. -'

P&LE workers return to
picket lines in workfuror

PITTSBURGH -—— About 750 employees
of the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad
were back on the picket line Sunday af-
ter the company failed to persuade its cre-
ditors and an Illinois firm to delay the sale
of the rail operation.

Fourteen labor unions representing the
workers had agreed to return to work late
Thursday, ending a two-day strike, provid-

ed the sale be delayed 10 days. But P&LE
officials told union leaders late Saturday
afternoon that was not possible, and the
strike immediately resumed. _

”This is a great disappointment to all
rail workers on the P&LE,” said William
LaRue, vice president of the Brotherhood
of Maintenance of Way Employees.

”We deeply regret that the P&LE failed
to convince its creditors and the Chicago
West Pullman Transportation Corp. to
keep their end of the agreement. We feel
betrayed,” he said.

P&LE spokesman Charles Craig said the
railroad would not disclose which party
objected to pushing back the scheduled
Oct. 1 closing of the rail operations.
Chicago West_Pullman still plans to buy
P&LE through a subsidiary‘ for $75
million.

”We did everything we could to com-

ply with the terms of the agreement,"

Craig said.

Union officialssaid Saturday evening
that pickets would go up at eight sites in
southwestern Pennsylvania and in Young-
stown, Ohio.

The employees initially went on strike
at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, accusing the
buyers of refusing to negotiate changes

Report says Navy ignored fire dangers onships

tions, including tearing up existing labor
contracts.

The unions and the P&LE agreed in an
out-of—court settlement Thursday,
however, that work would resume and
negotiations would get under way. Later
Thursday, Chicago West Pullman said it
would proceed with the sale as scheduled

and on Friday announced it was willing .

to negotiate a new contract at P&LE.

Praise heaped upon man

for Constitutional party ,

PHILADELPHIA — Like the founding
fathers, the bicentennial organizing com-'
mittee of We The People 200 Inc. found
a multitude of problems to work out
about the U.S. Constitution.

But 200 years and a number of adjust-
ments later, the Constitutional birthday
extravaganza went off remarkably well,
some said, considering the tenuous early
planning. '

At one point, contractor Willard Rouse

Sprint
gets best
gasoline
mileage

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON -—— For the
third year in a row, the three-
cylinder Chevrolet Sprint has cap-

tured the top rating in the annual ‘

gasoline mileage tests of the En-
vironmental Protection Agency.
There was no change in the se-

cond sp_ot either, held by a Hon— '

_ da Civic.

The 1,875-pound Sprint Metro-

model was rated at 54 miles per
gallon in city driving and 58 mpg
on the highway, the same figures
recorded for the Sprint ER last
year. The Honda Civic CRX HF
tested out at 50 mpg city, 56 mpg
highway. , -

The Lamborghini Countach, a
pistol-hot sports car from Italy ap-
pearing on EPA’s list for the first
time, was rated at six mpg in the
city, the lowest figure EPA has
ever recorded, and 10 on the
highway.

Last year's biggest guzzlers,
several Rolls-Royce models, ap-
peared on the list again just
ahead of the Lamborghini at eight
mpg city, 10 mpg highway.

There is no list of top domestic

‘ cars this year. EPA said it stopped
producing one because of the in-
creasing confusion over what a
domestic car is.

Japanese carmakers Toyota,
Nissan, Honda and Mazda now
produce cars in the United States,
sometimes in joint ventures with
U.S. companies. Typically they
ship major components such as
engines and transmissions from
Japan. ‘

These components are so cost-
ly that usually" the value of
domestic content, including
labor, in the cars is a little over
50 percent. EPA requires a model
to have at least" 75 ,percent
domestic content to be counted

as a domestic car.

Engineers to host Corporate
Exposition at Pitt nextmonth

By Hank Lerner
For The Pitt News

_ The William Pitt Student Union
ballroom will be the site of the
first University of Pittsburgh Cor-
porate Exposition. Organized by
the Engineering Student Cabinet

and the Society of Women En- .

gineers, the event features over
20 well—known companies.

The event is geared mainly
toward seniors seeking perma-

nent employment in the fields of
engineering or computer science.
It is open, however, to any stu-
dent who wishes to attend.

The exposition is designed to
be a pre-interview for both in-
terested students as well as for the
companies involved. It gives stu-
dents thejopportunity to meet
with representatives of many
major companies.

For the companies, it offe_rs
them the chance to meet with

some of the hundreds of students
expected to attend, giving them
a shot at picking out the cream of
this year's crop of engineering
and computer science majors.

Also, the university has the op-
portunity to spread the word
about its undergraduate programs
to some of the most likely em-
ployers of future graduates.

The event is scheduled to take
place Oct. 6.

Answers sought

as Bork hearings
enter phase two

By Richard Carelli
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — After the
first week of his confirmation
hearings, Robert H. Bork’s
chances of becoming as
Supreme Court justice remain
as much in doubt as the effect
his extraordinary five days of
testimony packs for future

' nomination fights.

As the Senate Judiciary
Committee prepares to hear
from Bork’s backers and
detractorsin the hearings’ se-
cond phase, key questions are
unanswered:

°WilI the impressions Bork
created in his bid to win ap-
proval by a majority of the
committee's 14 members be
bolstered or eroded as the
hearings continue? _

°What effect will the com-
mittee's vote, still weeks off,
have when the nomination
reaches the full Senate?

°Has_the Senate now estab-

based on those views?

For The Pitt News

They can be cramped and

dreary or large and comfortable._
0 -. . They are sometimes inhabited by

one student, but may house up to
seven. Actually, they are all what
a student makes them to be —

dorm rooms.

The dorms at Pitt vary in size

‘and appearance, but most of

them seem to give students the
same advantage — closeness to

V other people.

’’-I feel the experience of living

in a dorm room during my fresh-
man year-is a good decision be-
cause I'm exposed to so many
differentpeople and ideas,” said
Caroline Bayardelle, who made
her home away from home in the
Litchfield Towers.

The Litchfield Towers, the lar-
gest housing complex on the Pitt
campus, houses much of the
freshman class. Often, new stu-
dents complain of the abundance
of people, uncarpeted floors and
built-in furniture.

Occasionally, rooms must be
painted to cover up writing on

the walls from previous years.

’’It’s definitely not home,” ac-
cording to Lisa Tate, also a fresh-
man at Pitt. ’’But, I'm starting to
like it, and I'm meeting lots of
people. It's all what you make of
it,” she said.

Many other dormitories pro-
vide more luxurious accomoda-
tions than those of the Towers.
However, these rooms are usual-
ly reserved for upperclassmen.

Such halls as Brackenridge,
Bruce and McCormick introduce"
a different style of dorm life.
These halls reflect apartment-style

to four connected rooms sharing
one’ bathroom.

’’I was a little worried at first
about living with roommates I
didn't know, but I met a lot of
nice people," said Brian Owens,
a junior living in a Brackenridge
suite. ”You meet five new friends
right off the bat — we get along
very well.” ‘

ROTC  

Continued from page 1
dents passing that test are given
an airborne medal. ‘

They said they all liked PT, ad-
ding that it's not as bad as it
sounds.

”You have to get up at six,”
said Miller, ”but you feel good
about yourself; you're up that
early.” ’

Weiskircher agreed that PT is

not horrendous. ”The worst part_

is getting up,” he said.

Kirchoffner thinks as much, V

commenting that the Army is not
trying to create ironmen,
although cadets must be physical-
ly fit to meet approval.

Though the seniors interviewed
said they never wanted to quit the
program, they don't have partic-
ularly fond memories of an FTX
from last winter.

’’It was very cold and wet. And
we had to sleep on the ground,”
Miller laughingly recalled.

Weiskircher grimaced, ”We
had to eat nasty soup.”

Stover reflected, ”Now we can
look back and laugh/’. Miller ad-
ded that the experience made
him appreciate more the comforts
of civilian life he had previously
taken for granted. a

The cadets realize they may not
be given active duty in the serv-
ice and have plans in case they
don't become ‘regular Army.

Stover said she would get a job
in the reserves as nurse. Miller
said he would probably like to go
to law school or take a profes-
sional career.‘ - .

Stover said these things
shouldn't scare freshmen away,
saying it gets better after becom-
ing used to the military activities.

But ROTC is not just about

military activity. The cadets are 9

active in parades, take turns with
the Air Force in raising the flag,
and each year they hold a Mili-
tary Ball and a Dinihg In.

The Dining In gives the cadets

the chance to show their etiquette '

and courtesy. Any cadet caught
in a breach of etiquette or courte-
sy must step up to take a drink
from the grog bowl, an unsavory
potable made ‘of a mixture of le-
mon juice, sardines and other
non—tasty liquids.

' Though the program is both
challenging and fun, Kirchoffner
said ROTC is not for everyone.
Capt. Bruce T. Hart agreed, say-
ing students who do not enjoy a
physical or a mental challenge
should not join the program.

Hart added, ”Beyond that, they
should be prepared for playing
little Boy Scout or little Girl
Scout. If you don’t enjoy that,
then I would say’ROTC is not for
you.”

Kirchoffner added that these ac-
tivities give cadets the opportuni-
ty to meet other people. He said
it's like joining a fraternity or a
sorority.

The cadets are in the program
for a combination of eight years.
Students awarded a scholarship
must serve from two to four years
active duty, followed by four to
six years in the Reserves.

Students not winning scholar-
ships may serve three years in ac-
tive duty and five years in the
Reserves.

Kirchoffner said the Army
brings out the best in cadets.
”That’s necessary to command
the respect of your unit,” he ex-
plained. ,

As he reached across his desk
for a piece of cherry candy, Kir-
choffner reflected, ”That’s our

job, quality control. Quality’

breeds quality.”

Think again.

Since January 1987, AT&_T’s
rates have dropped more than
15% for direct-dialed out-of-

you probably realize. For infor-
mation on speciﬁc rates, you

can use AT&T to call from S S

teachings on

 divorce, birth control, abortion
 ’and- homosexuality; of priests
i;  who believe they have a right to

«_,', marry‘ and of blacks who feel ex-
 lcludedfrom leadership.

To the bishops, John Paul said

  it was a "grave error” to believe
I ‘ that anyone could dissent from

I  church teachings and still be a
 “good Catholic.”

"That doesn't mean I am going '
to start going on a witch hunt,”

 said Archbishop Edward T.

 O’Meara of-Indianapolis, one of

 

 

 the 320 bishops who met with
f’ -John Paul in Los Angeles.

Germain Grisez, professor of

ill _Christian ethics at Mount St.

Mary's College in Emmitsburg,
Md., suggested the question was
not whether the pope listened to

 the bishops, but whether the

bishops had heard the pope.

’’It was the clearest statement
he's made on those problems [of
dissent] during his whole pontifi-
cate,” Grisez said.

"He was telling us it is our job
to minister to all the people to de-
velop a deeper understanding of
the church's teachings. We try to
convert people and teach con-
tinual conversion to develop a

‘deeper faith,” said Bishop Tho-

mas Tschoepe of Dallas.

Archbishop Thomas Kelly of
Louisville, Ky., said it was un-
realistic to believe that any
changes would be immediately
apparent during the visit.

”No pope can ever be pres-
sured into anything by public
opinion. It just doesn't happen,”
Kelly said, adding that John Paul
”would never yield to pressure or
to public opinion. It's not in his

nature.”

Archbishop John J. O'Connor
of New York said he believed
reports of dissent within the
church have been exaggerated,
though he said there are dis-
senters among the nation's
bishops, some of whom "hate the
pope” for imposing rules.

"Wil| there be a renewed em-
phasis on the fundamental in-
structions, in which I think we
have been grossly lacking? I sus-
pect that that will occur,” O'Con-
nor said on Sunday.

Some Catholics, however,
were unhappy with what they
saw during the pope's visit.

Swidler said he believes the
church will relax its rule on
priestly celibacy and eventually
will accept abortion under some
circumstances, but not while
John Paul is pope.

Skaters

Continued from page 1
"Everyone complains about
people skating in the street,
but where do they have to
go?” he asked.

Jim Wilson, a Pitt junior and
participant in the contest, was

pleased with the event.

’’It’s a lot of fun. Everyone
comes to watch,” Wilson said.
”They [the university] should
give us someplace where we
can do this. We're not killing
anybody or raping anyone.
We're just skating and having

some fun."

”I’ve never seen any of this
before,” said Diane Chartreau,
a Pitt junior and spectator. ”|t’s
neat to see them do this here
instead of on the street.
They're talented. It looks real-
ly hard.”

Dorms

Continued from page 6
in Tower C. ’’I can study and also

 have people over whenever I

choose. I also have time to my-
self —- that's when I really enjoy
having ‘a room to myself."

Other residence halls,_ like
Forbes Hall and Holland Hall,
provide housing with single, dou-

ble and triple rooms. These halls
have a bathroom and a kitchen
on each floor. All the dorms are
co-ed except for Amos Hall and
Holland Hall, which house only
women.

With so many different types of
housing on the Pitt campus, most
students can find one that is suita-

ble to them.

Dorm life provides a good view
of total campus life and can be
very important in the life of a stu-
dent. With all the advantages and
disadvantages, most upperclass-
men as well as freshmen agree
that dorm life is a learning ex-
perience and a good way to loos-
en all the ties attached to them.

testified is not likely to dissipate
this week.

Numerous groups already have
spent millions lobbying for and
against Bork.

Groups including the National
Organization for Women, the
National Abortion Rights Action
League, the AFL-CIO, the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union and the
Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights will urge the Senate to re-
ject Bork's nomination.

Groups including Concerned
Women for America, the Ameri-
can Conservative Union and the
National Right to Work Commit-
tee will urge confirmation.

Three prominent Bork support-
ers —- retired Chief Justice War-
ren E. Burger, former presidential
counsel Lloyd Cutler and Illinois
Gov. Jim Thompson — were
scheduled to testify first when the
committee reconvenes today.

Representatives of the Ameri-
can'Bar Association will also tes-
tify, and they are sure to be
peppered with questions about
the ABA's divided vote on Bork.

The organization's I 5-member

standing committee on the feder-
al judiciary split 10-5 in finding
Bork qualified forthe Supreme
Court.

Four of the ABA committee's
members found him not quali-

fied, and one voted "not
opposed.”
Bork's supporters have

denounced the vote as a blatant-
ly political one, noting that the
ABA committee unanimously
gave Bork its highest rating when
he was being considered for the
federal appellate judgeship he's
held for five years.

As a law professor, Bork was
never shy about promoting his le-
gal theories.

Whether future nominees look
to the Bork hearings, or rather to
the Scalia hearings, for guidance
in dealing "with the Senate spot-
light may depend on their level
of confidence.

Scalia, who seemed supreme-
ly confident of confirmation even
as he refused to discuss many
areas of the law during his hear-
ings, won it by a 98-0 vote.

Robert Bork — the debate rages on

Your editorial of Sept. 15,

A "Hypocrisy and the pursuit of

power,”. makes a few assertations
which prove tojbe erroneous.
First, to say that there are no
respectable grounds for a’ senator
to have a pro/con position on the
Bork nomination prior to the
hearings is mistaken. Robert Bork

has been writing legal opinions as

both a professor and a judge for
years. A well informed senator
should review that writing, form
some independent opinion and
be prepared to use the commit-
tee hearings to facilitate the for-

‘Warding of his opinion.

Secondly, you assert that the
first order of debate should con-
cern the validity of an ”idealogi—
cally motivated protest.” There is
no such question because any de-
bate that involves judicial

philosophy will inevitably in-

volve ideology. Judicial
philosophy does involve the
ideological concerns such as the
use of the term ”liberty” in the
Constitution. What other option
is there?

Finally, in a fit of moderation,
you assert that it is the Senate's
duty to see that ”a fair and open-
minded person sits on the

' Supreme Court.” Well, no. The

Constitution describes the
senatorial duty as [that of] advice
and consent. If the Senate decides
to consider Robert Bork’s ideol-
ogy as expressed through his
available legal writings, then the
Senate has every right.

There is a great body of evi-
dence to consider. That a liberal
or conservative senator should
have some position on Robert
Bork prior to the hearings is mere-
ly evidence of that senator's elect-
ed role in the political process,
not of hypocrisy. Fight on, Ted-
dy. Fight on, Strom. .

LETTERS

‘ David Huntley's letter of Sept.
14 presents a skewed sense of

hope in the nomination ofludge .

Bork.

Contrary to Huntley's state-
ment, and in accordance with
that of Patricia Mueller, the
American public does have a
”cause for concern” regarding
the possibility of this nomination.

The issue of abortion and_ con-
traception is only one aspect of
the argument. Far more serious is
Bork’s general attitude toward
women and women's rights. Bork
claims that the Equal Rights
Amendment is a ”dangerous con-
stitutional revolution.” He op-
poses Reed vs. Reed, a decision
made in 1961 that extended the
equal protection clause to the
economic rights of women.

Bork holds similar restrictive
views regarding minorities. This
is evident in his refusal to accept
Shelly vs. Kramer, the decision
that prevents racially restrictive
clauses in real estate deeds.

The liberal court is guilty of
leaving behind ”the over|iberali-
zation of criminal and legal
procedures,” and yes, Bork is an
intelligent man. Because of his
backward views regarding wom-
en, minorities and constitutional
rights, he cannot be nominated to
the Supreme Court. America is
striving to uphold its reputation
as a democracy. We cannot af-

ford to regress, through Bork’s"

nomination, to an age where only
white males were privileged
enough to have full rights, and
women were continually kept
barefoot and pregnant.

Cacophonic madness

Do quiet hours still exist or was
I mistaken when I attended my
floor meetings within my first
week of school? Quietness is rela-
tive, no matter which part of the
buildi_ng one is in (or on).

I am referring to the loud mus-
ic, singing, cheering and commo-
tion from Amos Hall on
Wednesday night. An equal num-
ber of responses to ”be quiet”
were yelled back but to no avail.
Quiet hours start at 8 p.m. I as-
sume that some of the sororities
were not aware of this rule. The
screaming continued well past 10
p.m.

Yes, we have started classes
and people do study in their
rooms. Should the students, espe-
cially those who live in the Quad,
suffer as the sororities have their
”battle of loudness’’ during rush?
The sororities should keep their
rituals inside their buildings
whereas later they can battle be-
tween themselves and not the
resident student body. .

I bring this to the attention of
all students in hope that some-
thing will be done about it in-
stead of letting it drop by the
Hellenistic wayside.

Lunch in Hell

I am happy to say that I've eat-
en my last lunch at the Towers
cafeteria. No, not because I didn't
like the food served. Not because
I minded the long lines. Not even
because I minded spending an
extra five minutes of my lunch
hour to check my bookbag in and
out of the cafeteria.

No, these reasons, however
valid, had nothing to do with my
decision. Quite simply, I was
tired of being ripped off by the

university. I don't feel at all alone

A in my decision not to eat lunches

because if‘ you've eaten at Tow-
er A Iately, what used to be ca-
pacity crowd now appears to be
about half that.

The reason for this is yet
another of the university's
money-making decisions, which,
by now, any of you who have
been here for more than a year or
so should be used to. A student
who lives on campus can no
longer purchase a five-lunch
meal plan. He or she must pur-
chase a five-meal plan which in-
cludes lunches, dinners and
brunches.

This may seem satisfactory, that
is until you check some price
figures. Now, if you want to eat
five lunches just like before, you
must pay well over $100 more —
for no reason short of more
money for the university. True,
you can still buy lunches
separately for the same price, and
if you're a commuter, you still
pay the same, but should you be
one of the thousands of students
living on campus, you'll be out
another $100 for a meal plan.
Well, from the low attendence at
lunch that I noticed, the univer-
sity rooked none other than
themselves this time. [...]

On the changing Greek standards

 

JOHN
ENRIGI-l'I'

It seems like Theta Nu Gamma

, is really starting to cause quite a

rift within the Greek system here
at the university.

Last year, Pitt News staff mem-
ber Joe Zeff, who has since gradu-
ated, created Theta Nu Gamma,
the unofficial Pitt News fraternity.

Well, not exactly. There are
some Theta Nu Gamma _mem—
bers who have never worked for
the paper.

During the 1986-87 school
year, Theta Nu Gamma ads were
placed in the paper to fill small
amounts of ' space where, for
whatever reason, we couldn't put
editorial copy. The ads promot-
ed the activities of Theta Nu
Gamma, the pseudo fraternity.

Some rnembersof our unoffi-
cial fraternities even had sweat- t

shirts made with the Theta Nu
Gamma letters sewn on them.
, There were hardly any com-
plaints about the ads last year,
although Greek Advisor Brigette
Guernsey wrote us a letter asking
us to consider whether our ac-
tions were appropriate.
Obviously, Pitt News staff
members think the promotion of
Theta Nu Gamma is within the
boundaries of good taste, and the
overwhelming decision was to
continue the tradition this year.
There are those Pitt Greeks
who think the ads are funny and
view them as harmless (which
they are) to the integrity of the
Greek system. But thenthere are

_ those Greeks who are offended,

saying The Pitt News is mocking
the fraternity system.

At Saturday's Pitt-Temple foot-
ball game some of these offend-
ed Greeks let their sentiments be
heard — or rather, felt.

As most of you know, it is a tra-
dition for fraternities and sorori-
ties to carry their standards (those
big wooden signs with the Greek
letters on them) down on the field
to greet the Panther team onto’ the
field before each home game. _

Loyal Theta Nu Gamma mem-
bers participate in this process
also, carrying their standard,
painted in turquoise blue and
gold, onto the field.

Whether they continue to do so
at future home games is‘a debat-
able subject, though.

Nothing funny in

JEFF
SEWALD

The new network television
season has officially begun — on
schedule and with a few sur-
prises. In fact, for me, the "only
difference between last year's
season and this year's is that, this
time around, I'll be watching on
a different TV set. But how much
I'll be watching remains to be
seen. ' V

Having grown up with televi-

sion, naturally the tube and I have

become well acquainted. Over
time, however, our once-happy
relationship has ended up on the
skids. .

I blame the rift on a number of
things: too much sports program-
ming; too much mindless
schlock; too much moral turpi—
tude and far too little substance.‘

But above all else, the point of A

contention between myself and
network television has been its
reluctance to experiment with sit-
uation comedy.

When I was a kid, television
entered its acceleration phase as
an entertainment medium.
Revenues were up. Ideas for
programming were wildly diverse
and exciting. Consequently, sit-
coms were great. .

Comer Pyle, USMC inducted
us into the armed services for
laughs. Hogan's Heroes did the
same, though the backdrop shift-

ed to Germany in the midst of
World War II. Green Acres poked
fun at country living in the hick-
town of Hooterville. It's About
Time, which I loved even though
it survived only a" short time,
vaulted us backwards into prehis—«
tory. Gilligan's Island got us ship-
wrecked. I

The point is that, in the late
1960s (and to some extent, the
early 1970s), "sitcoms" were
more creative. The chosen situa-
tions were more experimental
and, at times, exotic. Converse-
ly, the sitcoms of the '1 9805 have
chosen to dwell on the contem-
porary and the topical and, in my
mind, none of them compare
favorably to those of yore.

These days, viewers.are con-
tinually fed situations such as
those presented by The Cosby
Show, Family Ties and Growing
Pains. The irony is that, while
these programs are designed sup-
posedly to address contemporary
family situations and issues, their
flippant nature destroys any hope
of actually fulfilling this promise.

Being representative of popular
drifts in American culture and so-
cial climate is not necessarily the
role of a situation comedy. In
fact, very few sitcoms have been
able to pull off the significance
bit. All in the Family did, as did
M *A *5 *H, to a degree. But these
were exceptions, with extraor-
dinarily strong scripts and perfor-
mances. Few otherslhave come
close. '

All of this is not to say that,to- '

Before the start of the Temple
game, a few members ofone of
the Pitt fraternities grabbed the
standard from Theta Nu Gamma
members as they were coming off
the field and broke it to pieces.

A Pitt policeman was standing
a few feet away from the incident
when it occurred but failed to in-
tervene in any way.

That's not so startling, but what
is mostdisturbing is the actions
of these fraternity members.

What it shows is a great deal of
immaturity and paranoia.

While everyone at the paper

and elsewhere has fun with The-
ta Nu Gamma and doesn't con-
sider it a mockery of the Greek
system, these frat brothers take
offense. They feel Theta Nu Gam-
ma is doing pertinent damage to
the Pitt Greek system.
. Yes, I have heard that there are
some students, who think Theta
Nu Gamma is a real fraternity and
has a ‘charter within the Greek
system at Pitt, and they have been
known to ask at frat parties, "So
where's Theta Nu Gamma?”

But is that so harmful?

And anyhow, if The Pitt News
wanted to poke fun at the Greeks,
why would “we have our own
standard at each home game?

We just want to be part of all
the Greek fun without commit-
ting ourselves to any IFC rules
and regulations.iTheta Nu Gam-
ma is really a harmless college
joke.

network

day's sitcoms aren't funny. Bill
Cosby is a brilliant comedian and
performer. Michael J. Fox has in-
credible timing and delivery.
Night Court and Cheers, from
time to time, hit resonant chords.
But all these programs remain ex-
asperatingly contemporary and
usuaL ‘

What I'd like to see from net-
work programmers is more fun
and imagination in prime-time sit-
coms. Alf is a step in the right
direction because, regardless of
your persoal feelings about the
fuzzy, little alien, you have to ad-
mit, he's a thing apart. If he could
only ditch that twerpy family he
lives with, the network might
really have something.

For a moment, consider a Brit-

ish situation comedy: The Young —

Ones. The show is syndicated in
the United States via MTV. The
situation? A handful of disenfran-
chised British youth joined
together as cohabitants of a skid-
row tenement. Contemporary?

Whoever there is within the
Greek system who is appalled by
the actions of Theta Nu Gamma
is being oversensitive and chil-
dish. As absurd as it sounds,
they're acknowledging.Theta Nu

Gamma as a detriment to the 

Greek system. ,
One anonymous Pitt frat mem-
"ber told us that Theta Nu Gam-

ma's existence may be brought in

up in front of the lntrafraternity
Council. 9

Gee, I wonder what they think
the IFC is going to do. Slap our
wrists and tell us that we're be-
littling the Greeks and we better
stop it? Or maybe the Greeks will

petition to have our charter taken I

away. — .

The same anonymous source - I

said that a ban on advertising in

The Pitt News is one possible‘ 
course of action Greeks may take _.

because of Theta Nu Gamma.‘

That seems like a pretty strong I I

stand to take, although I don't see
the point i_n it.

The only hope for a total dis- . . 3
bandment of Theta Nu Gamma is .
that next year's Pitt News staff de-

cides to put an end to it.
For now, Theta Nu Gamma

lives on, and Greek membersjbeit-, .. ;-.
ter get used to it. Those who take‘ 

offense should lighten up and not

take Theta Nu Gamma so serious- 4

ly because we don't ourselves.

/ohn Enright "is Editor in Chief . “

of The Pitt News. '

sitcoms 

Yes, but in a way that is in no way
usual. '

For example, one episode be-
gins with a bout of small talk be-
tween two characters into which

Vivian (the cast's nihilistic punker '

with the hopelessly effiminate
name) marches, angry as always,
with two sticks of dynamite taped
to his head. In his hands, he car-
ries a detonating device.

The tenement setting is un-
usual. The characters themselves
are unusual — each, at once,
repulsive and endearing. And the
element of surprise, that which
provides the spark to the comic
situation, is also ably at work.

’What will the mad punker Viv do
next? I'd take 30 minutes worth
of this time of unpredictable hu-
mor over strings of contemporar-

ily conceived and contrived-

one-liners any day.

Temple of

Pitt can't shake

the curse of the
Owl, lose 24-21

By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

After defeating North Carolina
State with a blowout 41-0 score
two - Saturdays ago, Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried warned that
although his team is good, certain
small mistakes made in key play-
ing situations would catch up to
it if it wasn't careful.

This past Saturday, the Panthers
got snagged. _ V

And the snare in which they
were caught was in the form of
a 24-21 loss to the Temple Owls.
This is the third time out of four
that Pitt has lost to this team.

”l know the kids worked hard,
just not hard enough it seems,”
said a weary and distant Gottfried
after the loss. ”But above any-
thing else, you’ve got to give
credit to Temple. They played a
solid game and fought hard for
their win. 5

”Our biggest problem is that
we couldn't sustain anything,”

continued Gottfried. ”We had_

some pretty ‘good plays, but once
they were over, we couldn't get

another one for a while. Finally, .

we weren't able TO overcome

that. And they just loosened up

and kept coming at us.

’’Basically, we wore down.”

The reason for the «far away
look in Gottfried’s eyes was ob-
viously the loss itself. The late
and legendary Alabama coach
Paul ”Bear” Bryant once said the
hardest loss to take is the one un-
expected. With a predicted Pitt
win and a 20-point spread to
boot, the Panthers became with
their loss the trod-upon par-
ticipants of a campaign that
failed.

The predominant opinion of
the team before the game seemed
to be that, with Paul Palmer gone,

By Chuck Melvin_

AP Sports Writer

CLEVELAND — A bizarre inter-
ception by Mike Johnson set up
an 1 1-yard tie-breaking pass from
Bernie Kosar to Gerald McNeil,
and Clay Matthews returned an
interception 26 yards for his first
career touchdown Sunday as the
Cleveland Browns defeated the
Pittsburgh Steelers 34-10.

Cleveland, which intercepted
Mark Malone five times, broke a
10-10 tie with McNeil’s third-
quarter touchdown reception.
The Browns, 1-1, then ran off 17
quick points in the fourth quart-
er to beat the Steelers 1-1 for the
sixth straight time in Cleveland
Stadium. _

‘ ‘ -«VM-atthews hadtwo of-the inter-..«

ceptions of ‘Malone, who was

there shouldn't have been any
problem in beating the Owls. But
the Panthers had no idea Temple
had employed a secret weapon
— a missile going by the name of
Todd McNair.

McNair, the 6—foot-1, 200-
pound junior tailback from Penn-
sauken, N.J., rushed 41 times in
Saturday's game for a net total
yardage of 213 yards. And on
almost every rush play he was in-
volved-in, he almost always went
to the left and toward the weak-
side of the line.

Because of the extraordinary
play recently of weak—side line-
backer Ezekial Gadson at that po-
sition, Temple head coach Bruce
Arians said helhad purposely told
his offensive linemen to zero in
on Gadson, so that his running
backs ’ would be able to slip
through easily.

The tactic worked.

”He was fast, and with most of
their other players keying on me,
at times there was nothing l could
do,” said Gadson. ”There were
points where there were three or
four guys on me and the others
[linebackers Jerry Wall and Jeff
Christy and end Burt Grossman]
had to come running across the
field.”

”lt’s all such a blur, I really

can't say what happened exact-
ly,” added Grossman. ”Those
toss-away plays they kept doing
really tired us out. .I found myself
having to go across the field in
order to tackle people.” ’
Going into the locker room at

l the half, it seemed all was going

Pitt's way. Midway through the
first quarter, a 21-yard Sal Genil-
la pass to Reggie Williams, and
a subsequent kicked extra point
by Jeff Van Horne sent the score
up, favoring Pitt by seven.
Please see Game, page 14

benched and replaced by Bubby
Brister midway through the fourth
quarter. Malone completed 12 of
36 passes for 151 and no touch-

downs. He was sacked three-

times.

Brister was intercepted on the
last play of the game.

Kosar completed 18 of 30 pass-
es for 188 yards and two
touchdowns.

Johnson intercepted a third-
quarter pass at the Pittsburgh
23-yard line after receiver Louis
Lipps dropped the pass but
kicked it just before it hit the
ground.

The first»Pitt blunder came at
10:26 in the third. A field goal at-
tempt for Pitt by Van Home was
fumbled on the snap (a problem
which seems to be recurring for
the Panthers this year — this was
the third in two games and the se-
cond in this game), and Van
Horne tried to recover it, result-
ing in a loss of two yards.

Then, a James Thompson pass
which probably would have been
incomplete deflected off of Quin-
tin Jones’ hands intd Keith
Gloster’s, who ran it into the end-

zone for a 68-yard touchdown. ,

This boosted Temple to only a
four-point deficit.

That was when things started
gettingsloppy. Sal Genilla almost
threw two passes directly into the
hands of two opponents and, at
2:53, he did for ‘Eddie Parker to
return it 13 yards. An ensuing
rush pattern mostly by McNair-,

and a barrage of penalties on Pitt
pushed the Owls up to the 2-yard
line going into the fourth quarter.

That was when it happened. At
14:31, Thompson ran up the mid-
dle for the goal, raising the score
to 21-14. He then tried a two-
point conversion. to Sheldon Mor-
r’is which was good. The Panthers
would never catch up.

An extra Temple field goal by
Wright at 1:53 and a last-ditch ef-
fort touchdown by Hosea Heard
for the Panthers ended the game
with the score of 24-21.

”We just made a lot of mistakes

that Temple took advantage of,”

said junior tight end David Tanc-
zos. ”We’ve just got to stop mak-
ing those penalties.”

But Grossman added a different
perspective to the matter.

”|t’s just like the story of the tur-

out and let them stay in until we
can't catch up to them and then
they win. We've got to stop do-

beginning.”

Gottfried has similar feelings.

”We’ve got to put this game
behind us. We should learn
something from it, but it’s over
now and the only way to go now
is up again.”

Alas, Arians’ “bashball” ultimately works»

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

0”Tonight we played what we
call ’bashball,' ” boasted Temple
head coach Bruce Arians. ”Run
the football and block the
defense. Nothing fancy —- just
giving the ball to the tailback and
passing when we had to. In the
first two "games of this year, we
had gotten too diversified offen-
sively; we’d gotten away from the

things we've done over the past ‘

few seasons.”

Well, this bashball stuff certain-

Pitt's defensive 11. Bashball
yielded an astounding 282 yards

PANTHER
NOTEBOOK

ther linebacker Ezekial Gadson
was last night? Temple tight end
Mike Hinnant had a pretty good

idea. ”We knew Zeke couldn't

match up with Hinnant,” said Ar-

ians. ”Zeke is a hell of an athlete, '

but [Hinnant] is one of the best
blocking tight ends in football.
Pitt tries to go with that Chicago
Bears '46’ defense, and we knew
that a two-tight end offense
would neutralize that. ‘

”There was no way Gadson
would be able to handle Hinnant,
so we ran our sweeps and traps
through the left side practically
every time.”_

Commented Cadson, who ac-
counted for a quiet 14 tackles,
”The two-tight end offense didn't

.hurt us. We just didn't execute

our defense the way it was
designed.” ’ '

Craig ”lronhead”_ Heyward
continued to produce grandly,

carrying the football for the Pan- '

thers. His 171 yards, including a
wonderful 46-yard TD sprint
which left the entire weak side of

the Temple defense with athletic
supporter-in-hand, was the only
bright spot offensively for the
team. At this point, lronhead has
to be taken into serious consider-
ation as a Heisman Trophy can-
didate —— he has a whopping 422
yards in merely three games.
°Granted, the Temple defen-
sive backs are a punishing outfit,
and Pitt quarterback Sal Genilla
did lead his receivers a bit much
on several occasions, but it
-seemed that the Panther wideouts
were hearing some pretty loud
footsteps, short-arming a notice-
able amount of passes through
the gut of the field. Guys, like the
Miami.Dolphins’ Mark Clayton
said you have to catch the ball
over the middle regardless of the
punishment. ’ -
0Temple’s Todd McNai_r, who
is stronger and just as quick as his
flashy predecessor Paul Palmer,
carried the football»41 times and

-gained a hefty 213 yards. ”Coach

[Arians] said we'd run the ball
more  With Ventres [Stevenson]
injured, I knew I was in for a long
night.”.Yes, Tim, and so was the
Pitt defense.

°What's with ‘Pittsburgh's field
goal unit? For the second time in
two games, Pitt has blown a
3-point attempt due to a botched

snap and/or hold. But unlike last
week, the result was a 2-yard loss
instead of a Billy Osborne jaunt
into the end zone.

‘Temple sure has Pitt's number
through the mid-1980s. The

. Owls have somehow topped the _
superiorly talented Panthers three .

out of, the last four years.
°Where was Adam Walker last

night? After a respectable perfor-_  
Vmance against NC State last week

‘in which he gained 77 yards,

Walker carried only twice for a A‘
measly three. For the Pitt offen-
sive gameplan to be truly effec- ' ’

tive, the ground attack has to be

more than Heyward as'the one-  

trick Clydesdale.

0The Sloppy Joe of the Week a ’

Award goes to both Pitt and Tem-
ple this time,around. The two
teams combined for 21 penalties
worth over 200 freebee yards.
.0 So what's the best team in the
East this year? After Saturday's
loss, Pitt knocked itself out of
contention. ”Syracuse is a good
football team. Pitt is a good foot-
ball team. Penn State is a very
good one," said Arians. ’-‘But I'll

tell You right now — Boston Col- 7 

lege is the best. Just wait and see
what kind of talent they have up
there.” Pitt meets up with the
Golden Eagles on Oct. 3.

What a difference a
makes.

As of lastweek, Pitt's defense
against the rush was ranked first
in the country, allowing only 16
yards a game. The Panthers were
fifth in the nation in total defense,
allowing 205 yards per game.

It was‘ only two weeks ago
when Pitt held Brigham Young to
a school record —- 76 yards on
the ground.

After dominating the first half,
the defense in the second half
faltered, allowing Temple to put
up 21 points which sealed the
Panthers’ fate. The main reason
— junior tailback Todd McNair.

Soccer team splits wins in two matches

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther soccer team
split two games this past week,
making their overall record 3-2.

Last Wednesday, they

slammed St. Francis 6-1 but un-
fortunately followed it up with a
2-0 loss at the hands of Bucknell
University on Saturday.
‘ ”The team is finally getting into
a groove,” said Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher. ’’I’m not dis-
sapointed with the way that they
played.”

The game against St. Francis
marked the most one-sided game
of the young season. Pitt goals
were scored in bunches and kept
St. Francis guessing throughout
the entire game.

. ”We started off the game
slow,” said Luxbacher. ”Both
teams had early chances but
couldn't connect.” -

The Panthers broke through at
the 35-minute mark on a goal by
senior Mike Grimes, followed by
a goal from Trip Taylor right be-
fore halftime. Taylor scored’
another goal later in the game.

Other Pitt goals were scored by
Kurt Webber, who had two, and
Mark Blatz. _

”The team played very consis-
tently,” said Luxbacher. ”We
played very strong in the second
half. We had more chances, but
couldn't put them in. We are
making progress.”

Saturday's game was at Buck-
nell, and the team held tough
only to be turned away in the
end, losing 2-0.

’’I’m not disappointed with the
way the team played,” said Lux-

bacher. ”We had, as many‘

Y

chancesif not more than they
did; [we] just couldn't put them
In.” ‘

The game was played at a
breakneck pace and turned into
a stiff defensive battle. Bucknell
scored right before the half and
never looked back. They scored
again in the second halfto put the
game away.

”This was a good game to
watch,” said Luxbacher. ”Both
teams played well, but they wer-
en’t able to put the ball in the net.
Bucknell is a good team; earlier
in the week, they had beaten

117

Temple, who is number three i_n
our region. So it was good to

hang tough. I'm happy with the_

way we played. The result is a lit-

tle different than I had hoped.” -
Pitt goes on the road again this -

week to West Virginia Universi-
ty on Wednesday. They return

home next Saturday for an after-”
noon game against Ohio State. 
’’I am told that West Virginia is

an improved team over last
year,” said Luxbacher. ’’It will be

a big test. Pitt hasn't beaten WVU-
- for about 10 years, so hopefully

”We just had a couple of
bumps along the way, and we
were not able to overcome it,”

' said head coach Mike Gottfried.

”We made a lot of errors, and we
didn't overcome the things that
happened. We didn't take care of
the opportunities we had. They

were a little more opportunistic
than we were.”

‘Opportunistic they were, and a
little bit of lady luck didn't hurt
their chances either. ‘

With Pitt leading 14-3 early in
the third quarter, Temple quarter-
back James Thompson threw
downfield to wide receiver Keith
Gloster. Senior cornerback Quin-

for a 68-yard touchdown.

’’It was just one of those rare
things that happened,” said

‘Jones, recalling ”the play.” ”He
was going deep. We were cover-
ing man—to-man, and on man—to-
man, we don't look up until the
receiver looks up. I looked up,
and it hit me in the facemask.

’’It just wasn't our week,” he
said. -

That seemed to be the general
consensus of the team, who were
left searching for reasons for the
downfall and seemed to be just
as dazed as anyone else.

”We made a lot of mistakes, a
lot of penalties,” Spindler said.
”We’ve got to get away from the
personal fouls.”

”The mistakes we made, they
compensated for,” said junior
right tackle Tony Siragusa. ”We
practiced really hard this week.

There-wasn’t a letup. We just

didn't play our best. We made-

critical mistakes and critical
penalties. We tried to adjust to
what they were doing, but it just
didn't work out.

’’I think we're in great condi-
tion. We were eager to make the
big play, and it didn't work out.”

”You keep some people in the
game long enough, eventually

they'll come back,” junior left.

end Burt Grossman added.

”l didn't think we executed the
plays to the fullest, the way they
were designed,” said senior line-
backer Ezekial Gadson, who led
the team in tackles with 14.

”We had the game in control.
Everyone was where they were
supposed to. be — it shouldn't
have made it different. We have
to learn how to face adversity,"
Gadson added. ’’It was frustrat-
ing, but we had a lot of penalties.

Discipline should have come into
play here.”

Discipline or not, execution or
not, or whatever was lacking, the
players are going to try putting
this game behind them and look
forward —to hopefully better
things. _

”We have to let it go and look
to the future. We have to look for-
ward to pulling out a win at West

- Virginia,” said senior right end 1 

Jon Carter. A
”We have to keep our heads

up. We still have a lot of games V V

‘A play.

By Ralph Bernstein
AP Sports Writer
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. —- Joe

Paterno suggested to running
back John Greene before presea-

' ‘ son practice that he might want

to transfer from Penn State to a
school where he had a chance to

”Iohn, I don't know whether

 you're ever going to be first

string. I just want you to know
that because maybe you want to

I if - go someplace else,” the Nittany

Lions’ coach recalled telling the
187-pounder from Youngstown,
Ohio.

Paterno said Greene told him,
’’I don't want to transfer, Coach.

I'll make it.”

Greene made it big Saturday as
20th-ranked Penn State c|ob-
bered the Cincinnati Bearcats

  TO ALL GRADUATE  
AND PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS

PLEASE REMEMBER

41-0, for the Nittany Lions’ se-
cond victory against one loss.

Greene and Blair Thomas com-
bined for 278 yards and three
touchdowns against the Bearcats.
Thomas gained 154 on 22 car-
ries, and Greene 124 on 11. Tho-
mas scored from the 1 and
Greene the 1- and 2-yard lines.

It was the first time two Penn
State backs gained 100 yards or
more in the same game since D.J.
Dozier (143) and Steve Smith
(126) did it against Boston Col-
lege in 1984.

Greene was at fullback in one
of Paterno’s massive lineup
changes prompted by the coach's
disillusionment over the 24-13
loss to Alabama a week earlier.

Paterno made changes involv-
ing a total of nine players on both
offense and defense.

Green started the season as

TO GIVE TO

      THE “UNITED WAY”
   IT BRINGS OUT  
THE BEST IN ALL OF US

  AND PROFESSIONAL STUDENT

backup tailback to Thomas.

”The main adjustment was in
blocking,” Greene said of the
move to fullback. ”The running
is basically the same as tailback.”

Paterno said of Greene, ”He’s I
a tenacious kid. He wouldn't give
up on himself.

”He got over some bad habits.
He was a herky jerky kind of run-
ner, all over the place. But he
worked hard. He took the bull by
the horn.”

Greene said he'd like to think
that his success is due to being a
little bigger and quicker. ‘

”And I'm hungrier,” he added.

He said he isn't satisfied yet.

”I think being a 185- pound
fullback, if I do stay, blocking is
something I'm going to have to
work on.”

Before Saturday, Paterno’S full-
backs carried the ball- a total of

three times.

”They are young kids who
someday are going to be good
fuIlback5,” Paterno said.

Cincinnati Coach Dave Currey
said, ”We ‘went into the game
thinking we would have to throw
the ball to win, andthe pass
game broke down. Defensively
we couldn't Stop the run."

He also said the Bearcats were
prepared to run the ball from a
power set.

Currey said backup quarter-
back Dan O'Brien suffered a
knee injury and would undergo
surgery Monday. He said liga-
ment damage wassuspected.
Starting quarterback Danny
McCoin aggravated an old knee
injury.

.”I do thinkthat the game
Showed people that maybe Penn
State is better than people think
they are,” said Currey, whose
Bearcats fell to 1-2.

There's more than one way toskin a Bearcat

The Penn State defense against
the run shared the game highlight
with Greene and Thomas. It held
Cincinnati to minus-3 yards, the
best performance by a Penn State
defense since it stopped Tulane
with minus-8 in 1979.

Penn State took a 7-0 lead at
6:08 of the first period when Tho-
mas scored from the 1 capping a
10—play, .60-yard drive. .

The Lions made it 10-0, 51 se-
conds into the second quarter on

V a 27-yard field goal by Eric Etze.
Thomas gained -39 yards on six
carries in the drive.

Before the half ended, Penn
State drove 46 yards on four plays
to make it 17-0. Greene ran 38
to the 2 and scored from the 1.

In the second half, freshman
Gary.Brown raced 36 yards for a
TD, Greene scored from the 2,
Etze kicked a 22-yard field goal

and Sam Gash ran over from the

he was slightly injured during the

St. Francis match, but it was noth- ~

As soon as I finished Advanced
Training, the Guard gave me a cash
bonus of $2,000. Then, under the New
GI Bill, I’m getting another $5,000 for
tuition and books.

Not to mention my monthly Army  
Guard paychecks. They’ll add up to A  
more than $11,000 over the SIX years
I’m in the Guard.   _

And if I take out a college loan, the
Guard will help me pay it back- up to
$1,500 a year, plus interest.    

It all adds up to $18,000—or more
—for college for just a little of my time.
And that’s a heck of a better deal than
any car Wash will give you.
