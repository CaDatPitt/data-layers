Engineers Schedule  

Concert, Seminar, Ball

For Annual Festivities

The theme for Engineers’ Week (March 13-16) this
year is Engineering and the Developing Nation.

According to chairman Albert Rocchini, the United
States and other world powers have invested billions of dollars in

newly developing countries in order to‘ improve their way of life. .

It is the challenge of trying to help these countries that made the

engineers choose this theme.

This year, for the first time in the history of Engineers’ week,
freshman engineers will compete as a separate department in order
to increase their participation in the week's activities.

A tentative calendar for the week includes the arrival of St.
Patrick at the Student Union (SU) at noon, Wednesday. Displays,
open all day, will begin at 1:30 p.m. in Engineering Hall.

A seminar at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall begins at 11
a.m. on Thursday. The Alumni Dinner begins at 7 p.m. in Webster

Hall.

The Shamrock Ball scheduled for 9 p.m. at Churchill Valley
Country Club is the highlight of Friday.

Appearing at the concert at 8
p.m. on Saturday are the Isley
Brothers and comedian George
Carlin. .

The Isley Brothers, according
to Mr. Rocchini, sky-rocketed to
the top of the recording field
with their hit record “Shout.”

George Carlin writes all of his
material and his satiricaltargets
cover a wide range of topics from
radio, and TV commercials.

The concert will be held in
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, and tickets will be avail-
able from members of the Cen-
tral Planning Committee or the
SU Desk. The concert is open to
the university community.

Dinerstein, Brzezinski Give Lectures

Leftovers Target
Of Soviet Policy

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

A revolutionary state can-
not conceivably remain sta-
tionary. Instead, it must
change with the ever-chang-
ing international political
climate. This is the case
with the Soviet Union, accord-
ing to Herbert Dinerstein.

Dinerstein, professor at the
School of Advanced Internation-
al Studies, Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, spoke Tuesday at noon
in the SU Ballroom. His lecture
was the first in a series on So-
viet foreign policy.

Tracing the rise of the Soviet
Union as a world power, he
pointed out that originally the
Soviets set out to promote so-
cialist revolutions" in industrial
countries. When their plans fail-
ed, Soviet leaders realized the
possibility of promoting revolu-
tions in underdeveloped areas.
“Emphasis on what is left over
is characteristic of Soviet for-
eign policy," he stated.

He presented the aims of the
Soviet Union’s foreign policy as
“supporting nationalist revolu-
tions, reducing Western inﬂu-
ences in underdeveloped areas,
and promoting socialist revolu-
tions in those areas.”

  

HERBERT DINERSTEINP

Says Soviets active in
Underdevclopcd Countries

“The Soviet foreign policy of
the twenties and thirties,” con-
tends Dinerstein, “was not a
brilliant success, but given the
balance of forces at the time,
they couldn't have done much
better."

After World War II Soviet
leaders were faced with two
problems, according to Diner-
stein. He said that they had to
decide both what their policy
toward colonies would be and
the role of nationalist move-
ments in furthering their cause.

Stalin advocated, according to
Dinerstein, watching liberation
struggles from afar, encourag-
ing verbally, yet not actually
offering military aid. Stalin felt

Brzezinski Views

East -West Ties

by DON MARBURY
“Actually,” said Zbigniew Br-
zezinski, a researcher at Colum-

bia University on Communist
affairs, “the Soviet attitude has
undergone a deﬁnite fundamen-
tal change. It is more ﬂuid, more
uncertain, much more critical
and hostile in matters concern-
ing the United States.”

Brzezinski pointed out that
the main mistake that both the
US and the Soviet Union have
made is “they want to have
their cake and eat it too.” “The
United States wanted to bomb
Vietnam and still be on good re-
lations with Russia. While Rus-
sia wanted to intervene in cer-
tain political matters and still
be on good terms with the US.”

Brzezinski pointed out that
the Soviet Union could not de-
vote as much concern to the US
as it would .like to because of
internal domestic and political
problems. Consequently, the So-
viet stress a new unity on the
basis of an anti-imperialistic
program.

“If you compare the United
States and Russia militarily, you
will .see that the United States
holds a slight edge," said Brzez-
inski. “At ith tim of the

ban military crisis had there

I been a war, the Soviet Union

could have killed 25 million
Americans. While the US could
have virtually wiped out the So-
viet Union. Today we still could
wipe them out, but the Russi-
ans could now kill 120 million
Americans.”

-Brzezinski said he doubted if
there were any hope for any
positive cooperation, because of
the gap that the arms race made
in determining international
peace. “But,” he said, “the US
should stress cooperation devel-
opment, for even if our efforts
for cooperative development
failed, we would be certain to
help our relationship with Eur-

ﬁl.

    

 

By Appointments, Debate

SG President Ken Schuele.

‘Madigan’ Portrays Beauty

by PAUL ANDERSON

Elvira Madigan is a real-
ly beautiful film. There's
just no other word that so
aptly describes thi's movie.
That’s unfortunate because
its use puts us in a bit of a
semantic bind. Popular vulgar-
ization has generalized the word
“beautiful” i-nto ambiguity which
necessitates a deﬁnition of terms.
You can ask a person if he
enjoyed a certain book and he
might well answer, “Yes, it was
really beautiful” when he does-
n’t at all mean that the novel
vvas handsomely bound -in red
leather or printed on parchment
paper. Also, the expression “that
was really beautiful” can be a
:ongr-atulation on a particulari-

ly clever remark or reaction.

So, by calulin-;g Elvira Madigan
a “really beautiful" ﬁlm, I don't
mean to claim that it is high in
intellectual content nor is it un-
usually clever, only that it is
aesthetically pleasing: a very
good-looking movie, nothing
more. The Danish countryside
is resplendent; the sun, forever
shining. Beautifully (well) told,
it is the delicate story of a

young count who deserts the

army and his family to run
away with a beautiful (very
good-looking) tightrope walker.

At the beginning of the ﬁlm
their life is a dream. Ex-Lieuten-
ant Sextcn Sparre ’(Thommy
Berggren) and his attractive
playmate (Pia Degermark) loll
away their lives chasing butter-

PROFESSOE ELECTED
TO INTERNATIONAL BODY

Professor Michael J. Flack
of the Graduate School of
Public and International Af-
fairs has been elected a full
member of the International
Institute of Differing Civiliza-
tions at Brussels, Belgium.

The Institute, an interna-
tional non-governmental or-

status to the United Nations,
has as its purposes the study
of problems on contacts be-
tween societies with differing
cultural backgrounds and val-

An Evening Of
Psychedelic
Prayer

When men encounters himself and
yet communicates with reality above
and beyond him, some call it Prayer.
All things Psychedelic are not drug-
ged, end all prayer isn't conven-
tionol.

We are privileged to be the guests
of Mr. and Mn. John Eskridge at

ﬂies through golden ﬁelds, mak-
ing love in the green grass,
drinking wine and eating cheese
in the forest. Jorgen Perrson’-s
camera lingers on Rcnoiresque
scenes of the lovers: she in a
long lace dress, carrying a para-
sol; he in stovepipe pants and
black cutaway jacket strolling
down leaf-strewn woodland
paths, hugging on the beach in
the wee wee hours or just mak-
ing sun dappled mooney-eyes at
each other.

But eventually their money
runs -out and the dream degener-
aites into nightmare reality. Be-
ing high born, Sexten has no
conception of What it is like to
work for a livin-g. He doesn't
know where «or how to start
looking for a job. 4'

His well-meant offer to help
a commoner with his task is
met with the rebuff, “This ain't
ﬁt work for the likes of you.”
Poverty and pnivation reduce
them to foraging for nuts and
berries in the forest. Like ani-
mals they‘ gobble anything the
land has to offer until their
systems reject the strange diet.

Elvira and Sexten hover on

the brink of starvation, in des-
perate need of help but both na-
ture and society remain coldly
indifferent to their plight. They
are 19th century ﬂower children
trapped in a world that cares
not whether they live or die.
The film sets a cul-de-sec tone
hopelessness and refuses to
budge.

Only if we realize at the start
that the lovers are «predestined
to suicide can we appreciate the
bitter irony of Elvira Madigan.
They are doomed to die in a
world that -celebrates life. The
ending is not a sad one nor does
it come as a surprise.

Sammies ‘Bounce Ball’
For Heart Fund Drive

Sigma Alpha

Mu (SAM)

social fraternity will

“bounce” into action next weekend on behalf of the Na-
tional Heart Fund. Beginning at noon March 15, the bro-
thers of SAM will attempt to bounce a basketball for 26
consecutive hours as a publicity gimic to raise donations

for the National Heart Fund.

The SAM brothers will dribble the ball on a flat-bed
truck which will take them through downtown Pittsburgh
to KQV radio station headquarters. While some men are
bouncing the ball behind KQV’s front window, others will
circulate through the area for donations. They will con-
tinue through the night until noon on March 16, when a

few SAM brothers will take the
ball and re-board their truck to
join the St. Patrick’s Day par-
ade. Duriig the parade, the re-
maining Sammies will again cir-
culate in the crowd to solicit
more donations.

In addition to the official ball
bounced at KQV, several others

-will appear at main shopping‘

centers throughout the Pittsburgh
area on Friday night. In addition
to Sammies asking donations
from the public at these areas,
KQV will encourage its listeners
to phone in donations. The tele-
phone donations will be picked
up by the Citizens’ _Radio Band,
a group of amateur radio opera-
tors located at various parts of
the Pittsburgh area.

Through donations in the down-
town area, in surrounding shop-
ping centers, from KQV listeners
and from the St. Patrick’s Day
parade crowd, SAM hopes to
raise a minimum of $1500.

The project is the local version
of a nation-wide drive called Sig-

ma Alpha Mu “Bounce for Beats.”

Every Sammy chapter in the
country will take part in a simi-
lar basketball bouncing activity
for the Heart Fund. Some chap-
ters will raise donations this
weekend, others will also take
part in their cities’ respective St.
Patrick’s Day parades. The Uni-
versity chapter will use a green-

Dr. Allen Pollack Discusses
6-Day War In Middle East

by RUTH ZAPLIN

“Prospects for lasting peace in
the Middle East seem dismal,”
emphasized Dr. Allen ‘Pollack
in a lecture Wednesday at the
YM and WHA. Dr. Pollack, as-
sistant professor of Russian his-.
tory, discussed the image of Is-
rael, her people, and the world
in relation to the psychological
impact of the “Six Day War."

Concerning the world’s image
of Israel, Dr. Pollack said, “Be-
fore the war, Israel was seen as
a haven for refugees. Israelis
were considered to be a -small,
dedicated, pioneering people.
Now the world views Israel as a
nation like any other nation and
no longer feels any obligation to
protect her.”

Dr. Pollack noted that there

was a psychological change in .

Israel's reaction. Before the
war, Israelis felt that they could
exist by themselves without the
support of other people. “After
the war their superiority com-
plex diminished,” asserted Dr.
Pollack.

“The Jewish reaction to the
war was one of disillusionment

with the world. They felt that
the non-Jewish population of the
world was not sympathetic to

the meaning that Israel held for
the Jews.”

According to Dr. Polllack, as
Israelis image changed from one
0-f insecurity, weakness and pro-

" t-ectlon to one of strength, mili-

tancy and aggressiveness, .the
hatred of the Arabs for the Jew-
ish state was psychologically in-
tensiﬂed.

This is one lecture in a series
in which Dr. Pollack analyzes
the interna-1 and external con-
.icts facing the young state of
Israel.

Students may not be aware of the newly revised Student Hand-
book written by the Dean of students Office to deahwith. the P0110195
and regulations for undergraduate students at the University. The Stu-
dent Handbook contains various rules concerning such items as class
cuts, academic honesty, alcoholic beverages, gambling, destructive be-
havior to persons or property, rallies or demonstrations,.smok1ng, drugs,
ﬁre arms, civil prosecutions, fraternity houses, and student organizations.

In the section dealing with rallies and demonstrations, the Hand-
book states that students must not participate in activities “which dis-
rupt the regular functioning of the University. As you may remember,
last week the Tap Day Cerem-onies were interrupted by students who
forced their way to the podium. This is patently a violation of the reg-
ulation quoted above, but no disciplinary action was taken. Those stu-
dents who participated in this episode correctly sized up the situation
at hand, for the administration cowered in the face of the Tap Day
demonstration and did not enforce the regulation.

The student participants were right in their appraisal that they
would receive no punishment and correctly recognized that the way 130
be heard was to demonstrate their disdain for the proper channels. In-
stead of approaching Student Government with a request to open _up
Tap Day, which they felt would not be granted, they took the situation
into their own hands and accomplished what they sought out to do——
to speak their piece. »

goals by the use of force were successful. There have been far too many

proved to be the ineffectual rules and regulations outlined in the hand-

Those of us students who tried to work through the channels this
year and were repeatedly stymied in our attempts can only be disheart-
ened upon continually witnessing the administration cower in the face
of force. For all too many administrators not only cower in the face. of
force; more importantly, they frequently attempt to thwart those of
us who try to play by the rules. .

When students are continuaily promised such things as a new

‘Student Union and a students’ book center and no real action is ever

taken, how can they be expected to be satisﬁed with sitting back and
accepting defeat? We would never be ones to sanction the use of force,
but it is indeed a sad commentary on this University that this appears
to be the most effective way to‘ make ourselves heard.

We only hope that those students who stood up at Tap Day and
feel str-ongly about opening up this University channel their energies
toward such causes as the book center and a new Student Union. For
their voices need to be heard on these vital issues and the strength of
their conviction felt. We also urge our administrator in student affairs
not to dismiss those of us who want to achieve results by working
through the channels; for if students continue to fail in representing
students’ rights by peaceful means, it will be no’ surprise to us if they
choose that other alternative. The possibility is not so remote as many

 

 
 

 

  

 

    
  

But were the students really taking such a gamble? This is not

Part Two

  The Death Of Reason

In Wednes~day’s paper, I talked about the in-
creasing reliance of people upon dogma and fad,
about the incarnation of intellectualism and the
harm that has resulted from this. In this issue, I

would like to explore some of the causes of this a

phenomenon that has resulted.

ma . ,‘ 1 U vpclultilonar‘ creature. We have
maégizrtiiigdibtatibnb ‘t‘(’:/‘6“13‘i~ %‘r‘.¥z‘.‘r‘6ia*;r.%*sr. we
have enlarged our cerebrums, shortened our toils,
and call ourselves human beings. But Darwin’s
dictum that the world belongs to the organisms
that make and continue to make successful adapta-
tions to their environment holds true. Each bit of
our substances, and every second of our behaviour
must be measured on this scale.

I We have come up with enormous brains that
handle tremendous amounts of information. Up to

now, we have felt this to be adaptive, allowing us

to compensate for a lack of physical speed and
strength. At first thought, this seems to be com-
pletely advantageous. But I think it is not. Be-

‘ cause with this adaption has come the phenomenon

of consciousness, a sort of double feedback that
not only senses information, but is aware that the
information is being sensed. We are aware of our-
selves, and with this awareness has come something
called the self-image, cogito ergo sum.

Secondly, we have the ability to conceptualize.
We can take the individual data of day-to-day life
and form vastly unrelated events into coherent con-
ceptual systems. These, in part, are our values.
And, in a very real sense they are indispensable to
-our lives, constituted as we are.

However, our ability to perceive and recognize

' interrelations of so much more data than any other

species leaves us, very simply, with a filing prob-
lem. How are we to organize all of this informa-
tion into manageable blocks? Life is a system of

I negative entropy, and, to survive, we must be able

to organize all of the information that we con-

’ scious are aware of.

In one sense, our intellectual ability has been
useful. We have proven quite adequately that we
can adapt to practically any environment at all.
We live in submarines beneath the sea, satellites
above it, and cities floating on its surface. Our
problem is adapting to ourselves. What this means

_ is that we have found ourselves in the position

where a favorable evolutionary adaption has left
us in power of our enviornment, but with it has
come the problems of dealing with our increased
ability to receive information. Our ability to con-
ceptualize means that we are receiving information
not only from the environment, but from ourselves.

“Thinking” that is the natural accompanicr of
consciousness. How are we to handle this informa-
tion? Our solution seems to be at least partly, the
process of grouping large amounts of information
into single descriptive frameworks. There are

many terms that various of the social sciences I

use to describe these frameworks, but the on
‘ in far is-idem: .

   

        

by Hobart Harris

.An ideology is a core of value judgments and
perceptions that ideally are generalizable to any
bit of information or situation that we might be
exposed to in our lives. It is a pre-set measuring
system stored somewhere in our heads that allows
us to look at the world, and make sense of it. It
is indispensable, but it has increasingly become so
indispensable that the whole system, meaning us,
‘is “canstaairy teetering on the edge of disaster.

The reason for this is that there is an appro-
priate amount of information that ideological sys-
tems can handle, and there is a point that a single
system or group of perceptions are not sensitive
enough to organize the world truthfully. The re-
sult is a sort of overload where, people lose their
“feel” for the facts and are left judging things
by the standards that they do understand but are
often inappropriate.

The best example of this is in the political
field, where the amount of information that is re-
quired to understand what is going on in the world
has reached the point that it is virtually impossi-
ble for the individual to understand what’s happen-
ing. Look at all the people who have such disparate
views of the world on any of the dozens of major
issues that are essential to the country’s and the
world’s welfare. -

The Vietnamese issue is a case in point. The
prevalence of dogmatism and closed-mindedness on
the part of the advocates of both positions is a
wonder to behold. Tell a hawk that the Vietcong
are patriots. Try to tell a dove that the Viet Cong
do commit unnecessary atrocities. And this is what
I was talking about in the column Wednesday.
Rationality has all but disappeared among a ma-
jority of us, and didacticism has replaced it.

But at the same time, I don’t think people are
“responsible” for this, in the Existential sense. It’s
simply the situation. There is an abstract, imper-
sonal quality about much of life that defies simple
judgment while at the same time requiring some
judgment. The reliance on ideologies, on “things”
is simply the result of the fact that we must rely
upon something; to avoid the issue is to stop func-
tioning entirely.

So that is the problem. Man is an evolutionary
creature who, like all life, must organize his world
into cognitively consistent systems. He has created
a culture that stretches this ability too far, and has
found himself alone in a Frommian world where
his abilities are overstretched by information com-
ing in. The result is an overreliance upon simple
rules that simply do not apply, but at the same
time are held on to even more tightly, because of
the fact that the more complex the input is, the
more desperate the need to organize the informa-
tion becomes.

As life becomes more complex, it will become
increasingly difficult to make sense of the world,
Man's marvelous adoption, his brain, will have
proven to be nonadaptive, and unless something is
done, our reliance upon ideology will continue to
grow unchecked, our ability to communicate be-
tween both individuals and cultures will decrease,

Rocky Days Ahead

by Marc S piegel

It’s been a long hard winter of discontent, befuddlement and
psychic frustration for the political liberal. In horror we have
watched the administration’s growing commitment to the war in
Vietnam, which is, at the very least, a war of questionable merit
and may be remembered as one of the greatest of human tragedies.
All of this comes at a time of increasing tension and disunity_ at
home. There is no real hope of preventing waves of rioting from
sweeping our cities again this summer. These disorders may even
spread to new cities including Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.

As Vietnam drains more and more of our resources, less will
be spent in the decaying cities and on our once “top priority” poverty
program. Without a massive effort, internal conditions will not im-
prove but will worsen. Summer after summer, the riots will become
more intense until the government may feel it necessary to have
quasi-military control of the cities. The next obvious step would be
the stiﬂing of the underground black press for “intema1 security
purposes.” In such a situation it will become obvious that we are
on the escalator not only to more death and destruction in Vietnam,
but also toward the crippling of liberty and democracy in the United
States.

This picture of the future is frightening, but unfortunately not
impossible. What is even more disturbing is that, until now, we
have had no logical alternative present itself in the presidential race.
Robert Kennedy has chosen the path of personal political prudence.
The differences between Nixon and Johnson do not quicken the
voter's pulsebeat in ectasy. George Wallace offers nothing less than
the strong possibility of a tragic throwback to McCarthyism. We do
have the new McCarthy and the gallant senator deserves our full
support. However, he can not win. In November, in practical terms,
all of our efforts will have amounted to little more than emotional
masturbation. o

The presidency began the war, the presidency controls the war.
Lyndon Johnson nominated by 70% of the delegate votes will be as
adamant in the prosecution of that war and all of its concommitent
tragedies as Lyndon Johnson nominated by 95% of the delegate votes.
Until last week this was the dire position of the political scene. How-
ever, George Romney's wise and dramatic withdrawal from the presi-
dential race has opened up a new area of hope for American liberals
and‘ moderates. Mr. Romney has brilliantly thrown the spotlight upon
the one hope that our society has in 1968—Nelson Rockefeller.

Rockefeller, despite a few tell-tale specks of garbage, is, for this
campaign, a new candidate. He can "run for the Presidency on a plat-
form, not to unilaterally withdraw from Vietnam, but rather to take
a fresh look at the war as Eisenhower promised to do With Korea.
On such a platform Rockefeller might be able to defeat Johnson in
November. There is, however, one major hurdle to this happy occur-
ence. Rockefeller will defeat no one in November if he is not nomin-
ated in June.

At last a practical pathway presents itself to the frustrated po-
litical activists. We must convince the Republican Party that Nelson
Rockefeller and not Richard Nixon can defeat Johnson. We must
shout the name Rockefeller to the skies., demonstrate in his behalf
and aim much of our demonstrations in Pennsylvania toward Ray-
mond Shafer, a potentially important link in the strong governors
coalition that Rockefeller will need to win.

There are a lot of ifs and maybe’s, here. Nixon is far ahead in
the GOP polls with “Newsweek” suggesting that he is only 46 dele-
gate votes shy of the nomination. But, our course is clear, it is the
only pragmatic one we have. That course can be summed up in three
words-—Rockefeller. Rockefeller, Rockefeller.

Letters To The Editor

Athlete Corrects
Gym Editorial ‘

Editor, The Pitt News:

I wi.sh to thank Mr. Rosen-
stein for his sports editorial in
the Feb. 28‘ issue of the Pitt
News. It has long been neces-
sary to call attention to the sit-
uation of gymnastics here.

However, Mr. Rosenstein has
been misinformed about “the
lack of top caliber high school
gymnasts in the Western Penn-
sylvania area.” The situation in
this area is the exact opposite.
The Western Pennsylvania re-
gion has developed some of the
most highly qualiﬁed gymnasts
in the United States in recent
years. Gymnasts from this area
have been NCAA champions
EIGL champions, Big Ten cham-
pionrs, and members of the 1967
Pan American Gymnastics squad
and all within the last ﬁve
years. There is also a very
strong possibility that at least
one gymnast from this area
will be a member of the 1968
Olympic team.

Once again, I am glad that
Mr. Rosenstein has informed the
student body of the problems
existing in the sport of gymnas-
tics at Pitt. However, being from

Discussion Show

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reference to Mr. “Name-
with-held’s” letter concern-ing
WP-GI-I’s Hot Seat radio pro-

gram, I would like to make the
following points which have rel-
evance to the program. Because
I am the moderat-or of VV.PGH’s
Hot Seat, t-he Univensity com-
munity can be assured that the
program is being conducted on
the highest intellectual level
possible and with the best taste
imaigina-ble. There has never
been a derrogatory reference
made to any person or persons
connected with this University
on my program.

As far as the program on por-
nogralphy of Feb. 16 is‘concern-
ed, the deubauclhery to which Mr.
“Name-with-nheld” alludes did
not exist in reality «or on my
program, but rather in his own
rat-her demented fantasies! I, as
well] as thousands of dormitory
residents of the University who
listen to my program on Friday
evenings, would never take it
upon myself to dabble in such
licentious trivia as raw pure sex

on a radio pro~gram——nor would

I ever grant -such a banal topic
the opportunity to bridge my
disthemic lgalp. If a guest on my
program should ever contrive to
treat the subject of sex in such
a wanton manner as Mr. “Name-
with-held” suggests —— I would
have no recourse but to make
the guest painfully understand
why my program is called Hot
Seat.

On Overhearing a Conversation

by DR. RICHARD F. S. YANG

Chairman, Dept. 0_f East Asian

Languages and Literatures

The other day while pass-
ing through a hall in the
Cathedral of Learning, I
overheard the following con-
versation:

“Long time no see. How is
everything?”

“Just ﬁne. How about you?
How’s everything going this
term?"

“OK, I guess. By the way,

 what are you taking this term?"

“Oh, the usual stuff. ‘But I'm
taking Chinese t-o fulﬁll my lan-
guage requirement.”

“Taking Ch-inese? You must
be crazy?”

Upon hearing this, I made a
quick disappearance for I knew
that one of the conversational-
ists was a student of mine, and
I was afraid that if I was no-
ticed, it might cause embarrass-
ment on the part of the ques-
tioner or the answerer.

But as soon as I left the Ca-
thedral, I felt a sense of regret.
I thought, perhaps I should have
stayed a little longer to ﬂnd
‘what kind of reply my student
would make to his friend. And
then I thought further, wh-at
would I say if I had been in
my stu-dent’s position? All the
way home, I could not help
thinking about the incident and
my mind was ﬁlled with m-any
random thoughts.

My -mind went back to the his-
tory of more than a hundred
years ago, when the first offi-
cial treaty was signed between

i United States
ii}?-3’, S313 iii? ‘titty, it rains
wi-th a series of other treaties
(now being called “unequal trea-

A ties”) had forced open China’s

door -to the West, thus opening
a new chapter in China’s his-
tory (usually called the “mod-
ernization” of China), and also
started a gradual but ever-in-
creasing ﬂow of government of-
ﬁcials, lbusinessmen and mission-
aries to China from America.

Speaking of missionaries, I
couldn’t help but think of an in-

cident that occurred in my child-
hood. I was living in a village
in north China at the time. I
came across a strange man,
. strange but kind, who handed
me a tiny book whose title (in
Chinese) I could read but could
not understand. Later, I found
that the title of the book was
called “The Gospel According to
St. Mark,” and that “strallgﬁ
but kin ” man was none other
than a missionary. «
When my family moved to

Peiping (present Peking) from
the country, for the first time
in my life I saw many odd-
shaped houses known to be

churches and I met many more

of those “strange but kind” peo-
ple. At ﬁrst my feelings toward
those people were rather un-
easy. But later a sense of peace
and harmony wa.s -developed in
my heart and the strange feel-
ings disappeared.

By the time I went to college
(mine happened to be a college
run by missionaries) I practical-
ly lived (in, the dorms) with
many missionary-teachers on
campus. It was at this -time that
I ﬁrst learned to speak English.

‘But I never ran into any friend

who would remark: “Learn Eng-
lish? You must be crazy.” As a
matter of fact I did become
crazy about the English lan-
guage because it was so differ-
ent, so interesting, though it
was not easy to learn. Later I
was able to talk with my teach-
ers in their native language. I
had a marvelous -time in college
because of the many friends I
m.ade with my missionary pro-
fessors from whom I learned
about America and the Ameri-
can people. As a result, the col-
lege education I received had
helped me open my eyes and

widen my horizons to a larger

world. I never questioned the
reason “why” I studied English
or “what” I would ‘use it fo-r.
Then my thoughts went back
to the year 1949. It was in that
the Communists gained con-
trol in China; and it was in
that year the “China door” was
once again closed. The cordial
and friendly relationship be-

the Korean War which was a di-

na’s membership, and the pro-
and—con deba-teas throughout the
country on the question of the
recognition o-f China?

There is, however, a question

of priority I would like to em- ,

phasize. When the Federal Gov-
ernment (Congress) passed the
National Defense Education Act
(NDEA) in 1958, its primary ob-
jective was to alert and encour-
age college students to -the im-
portance of the st-udy of sci-
ences and -languages. The Office
of Education h-as sivgnled out six
“critical” languages which this
nation considers -of primary im-
portance. Chinese language tops
the list as number one.

You may like to ask, “Just
what are you driving at, Dr.
Yang?” My answer is, “You!”
And my question to you is: How
are you faring at Pitt? Are you
still following the same old rou-
tine, taking the same old courses,
seeing the same old faces and
living the same old life as you
did before (you came to Pitt)?
Or, have you come out of your
small world, and come into a.
bigger world, by pushing your
horizons a. little further and of-
fering yourself a new vista? Of

course, if you don't want to face
reality, you can always find a
way out. It is easier for you to
escape from reality in America
today than it was for me in Chi-
na when I was your age. But if
you are serious about your col-
lege education and with life it-
self, then I advise you to gather
courage to take an inventory of
yourself.

If you were the questioner in
the above-mentioned conversa-
tion and I were to answer your
question, then my answer would
be a simple “yes.” For if I had
not been “crazy” enough, I
would not have had the guts to
study a language like English;
Then I would have certainly
missed the chance of knowing a
great people, a great nation and
a great culture. I would prob-
ably still be living in my small
world, seeing the same people,
follilowing the same routine, and
leadin-g the same way of life.
Then I would be “like a frog
living a-t the bottom of a well”
(pardon the Chinese proverb).

There are always to alterna-
tives to face life; the easy way

and the hard way. The “crazy”

people choose the latter.

Pittenger Maps Child Growth q

by DAVID BAER

“The early years of a
child’s development prove
to be crucial in his later
search for identi'ty,” accord-
ing to Doctor Rex Pittenger,
currently conducting a ser-
ies of lectures at the YM and
WI-IA. Dr. Pittenger says that
“by the time adolescence is over
and identity is achieved, the ma-
jor decisions of life will have
been made."

Dr. Pvittenger is the director
of Allegheny County's Mental
Health and Retardatio-n Bureau.

A child’s feeling of basic trust
and conﬁdence is established
during his ﬁrst year of life, con-
tends Piittenger. The sense of
“whether -or not I belong" be-
gins to develop the ﬁrst time
the mother takes the baby in‘
her arms.

According to Dr. Pittenger in
the second year of life the child
realizes that he is capable of
controlling his sphincter muscle
and his voice muscles. Now that
the adjusted child has gained a.
sense of conﬁdence and the

that colonial liberation would be
a “prolonged affair,” that the
struggle would take 50 years
rather than one generation. He
was not prepared to invest So-

’ viet resources in areas far from

the Soviet Union.

“Successors to Stalin,” said
Dinerstein, “thought that they
correct all of his mistakes and
pru s h e d i-n to underdeveloped
countries.

By the mid 1950’s, the Soviets
believed that -if they could
coordinate their policy with the
industri~al world, their success
as a world -power would greatly
increase.

In 1955, the Soviet Union of-

fered arms to N assar’s national-
ist regime. “This was the first
time that the Soviet Union mov-
ed large military stores into an
area not contiguous with the
Soviet Union,” he pointed out..

At ﬁrst the Nazssiar movement
seemed like a triumph for the
Soviet Union because it increas-
ed the breach between the Egyp-
tians -and the British. Later, -con-
tends Dinerstein, it became clear
that the US rather than the
USSR was the influential pow-'-
er. Dinenstein interpreted the
Suez crisis as meaning that “if
an underdeveloped country has
had the USSR as «a -friend, it
could ﬁght with a Western pow-
er."

knowledge that he is capable, he
is about to encounter his ﬁrst
identity situation. From the age
of three to the age of ﬁve the
child is faced with the problem
“Who am I?” From this basic
point the problems of identity
continue to grow more complex
and pressing as the child grows
into adolescence.

“During early adolesence the
need for identity is acute,” stat-
ed Dr. Pittenger, “Clubs, cliques
and gangs all help to provide a
temporary sense o-f identity for
the adolescent.”

Dr. Pitten-ger noted that asso-

because they are afraid of criti-
cism from the adult community.
The adolescence himself, how-
ever, needs and wants to hold
onto the identity of a club until
his formative years are com-
pleted. Dr. Pittenger feels that
“giving more time «to collect da-
ta is appropriate.”

Dr. Pittenger feels that one of
the problems with accelerated
education is that while society
can undoubtedly push people
through courses it cannot hope
for them to achieve the identity
associated with the occupation
or role they will have to assume
in life. Its people will become
educated, but not really ready
to take their place in society.

Another crisis in id-entity -can
come about when a child has a
physical de-fect, -said Dr. Pitten-
ger. In this instance the adult
can once again hurt the child’s
chances «of ﬁnding his identity
by refusing to recognize him as
a “person with a defect, rather
than a Icriple who needs to be
pitied.” The -child must realize
what his limitations are and
what he can do. Only then can a
child hope to ﬁnd his identity,
he asserted.

UP, UP, AND AWAY

If you think Charlie Brown finds it rough to manage
a baseball team, try to put yourself in Bobby Lewis’ position.

One week from today, the spunky coach of Pitt’s base-
ball team and has 25 man squad hop on a bus out to the
Greater Pitt airport, climb aboard a waiting TWA jetliner,
and go up, up, and away—3,000 miles away—to a nice little
place by the friendly townsfolk called Riverside, California.

Eight days and seven nights later, Lewis and his
bronzed team will return t-o the city of the Golden Triangle.
They’ll step briskly off their Boeing 707 to confront the
everpresent haze, and maybe, just maybe, little Sammy
Glass, the catcher and team sparkplug will be overburdened
by an award from those nice folks in Riverside.

It was about ten months ago when Lewis found out
that his team would be asked to the Riverside Invitational
Baseball Tournament. Because only eight teams are selected
from across the nation, Lewis accepted the invitation im-
mediately. “The kids deserved to go,” he said proudly then
and repeats now.

However, in the week remaining before departure,
Lewis has Charlie Brown outdistanced. Foremost of Lewis’
concerns is to coordinate the final drive to sell the remain-
ing raffle tickets. That must be done or as Lewis grins, “I
may have to sell my car.” (The drawing for the color tele-
vision will be held Monday in» the Towers Lobby.)

Lewis also has to worry about baseball. -His team has
spent virtually all of its time indoors and that’s no way to

run an airline. The schedule on his desk calls for seven,

games in six days, against Kansas, Oregon, UCLA, Cali-
fornia, Mississippi S-t., Tennessee and Brigham Young.

“UCLA will have played something like 18 games be-
fore the Tournament,” Lewis points out. “Riverside has
about 14 in already.” P-itts’s regular season schedule calls
for only 24 games.

From the teams’ standpoint, Lewis has to find the
pitchers to team up with Dave Welty. The coach is confident
his lefthanded ace can do the job, although Lewis is afraid
that “Welty can’t have a year like last year.”

Last season Welty hurled 44 2/3 consecutive scoreless
innings. During that string, he fired a no-hitter against
Syracuse. He averaged 16 strikeouts per game over the sea-
son, finishing with seven complete games and a 6-1 record. In
the game against Penn State which the southpaw lost on
a bloop single, he struck out the first six batters and 15 in
all.

Next week is a different story. But if George Me-dich
and the rest of the mound staff can supplement Welty,
Lewis’ veterans are confident they’ll surprise the folks in
Riverside. Its a tall order, but even Linus wouldn’t run
away from it.

Good Practice Weather Needed

 

With the drinking age in the state of

 at Fitzgerald Field House.

The varsity is aiming for a vast improvement over last year’s
disasterous showing, when they only managed minus two points-—

good enough for a last place finish.

Earlier in the week coach Dave Adams, guiding his first squad
into the Easterns, indicated that pre-tourney preparations were pro-

ceeding as planned.

“Everything’s going along as well as we could expect,” com-
mented Adams. “The team spirit’s good.”

Adams also had several announcement. The first wasthe signing

from Canonsburg, Pa.

The other announcement referred to undefeated sophomore Bruce

  Freshmen, Roger Holly

Compete In IC4A’s

Tomorrow’s 1C4A Track Meet in Madison Square
Garden will probably be the last indoor meet of Roger
H0lly’5 career at the University. But, the end for Holly
may signal the beginning for four freshmen.

Holly is entered in the 600
yard run, while coach Jim Ban-
ner has entered a team in the
only freshman event, the medley
relay, How well the frosh fare
may be the key to the future
success of track here, for the four
runners are among the brightest
hopes on the promising freshman
team.

Smitty Brown and Wally Swig-
er will run the 440 yafd legs of
the relay while Rudy Hufnagl
runs the 880 and Jerry Richey
anchors in the mile.

The frosh have swept through
four dual meets with ease this
season, but the IC4A’s will be
their first test againsttop cali-
bre oppo-sition.

“Villanova is real tough,” said

Banner. “So are Harvard and
Georgetown.” Among Villanova’s
standouts are Marty Lecuori, who
edged Richey in the freshman
cross country championship,
while Georgetown boasts a. quar-
ter-miler who has run a 48 ﬂat.

But, according» to Banner, they
are not the only threats. “Villa-
nova has two good quarter-mil-
ers, Harvard has a good miler,
and Georgetown had two boys in
the top ten in the IC4A cross-
country meet.”

To prepare for the race, the
team members have been work-
ing on the baton passes all week,
since Banner knows that- every
second counts. But, despite the
opposition, the coach is optimistic.
“We should be a co-favorite,” he
guessed, “but not the favorite."

Roger Holly isn’t the favorite
either. He will be competing
against such stars as Villanova’s
Larry James and American U’s
bearded Andy Bell. James had
won 17 indoor races in a row
before he was edged by world-
recordholder Marty McGrady in
last week’s Knights of Columbus
meet. “How Roger does will de-
pend on the preliminary seed-
ings,” Banner commented.

Pennsylvania a limiting 21, this Univers-
ity’s students can hardly look forward to
an enjoying season of baseball and Ba1lan-
tine Beer. But with a little bit of luck, the
baseball season could be most enjoying
just the same.

Thus far, however, the baseball team has had
no such luck. The old nemesis of bad weather has
kept the mitters indoors.

“Tuesday was the only day we were able to
sneak outside," explained coach Bob Lewis. “It
was about 50 degrees out. But the field was soggy
and we couldn’t get much done.”

Indoors, the infielders are able to field ground
ballsand the hurlers can pitch in the practice cage
in the Field House; but you can’t hit fly balls
inside.

“The outfielders are suffering from the indoor
practices,” moaned Lewis. “They have to be out-
side to be able to field fly balls. They need prac-
tice in judging flies."

With enough practice the outfield could be solid
this year. A veteran outfield of Dave Welty,
George McKenzie, and Tom Stickel are all back
from last year’s 13-3 squad. But they'll be getting

 

Other positions are still up for grabs also. Steve
Kinsel, who hit .354 for the mitters last year has
used his three years of varsity eligibility. At sec-
ond base, Kinsel’s former position. Rick Mack and
Dave Dorst are battling it out for the starting role.

Last year’s third baseman, Tom Beckett is no
longer with the baseball team either. As of now,
Ken Snyder has the inside edge at the hotsack.

Color will be added to competition for starting
assignments on the pitching corps with the pres-
ence of sophomore footballer George Medich and
Frank Gustine. Gustine ‘is also available fo-r catch-
ing duties.

But Lewis is going to have a hard time deciding
his starting team if his squad isn’t able to practice
outside. And the baseball team is going to have a,
hard time looking like last year’s, winners for the
same reason.

The baseball season gets under way in Cali.
fornia, March 18, where the baseball team will be
playing seven games in six days. Those games will
be considered spring training games, although
they’ll count on the mitters’ overall record.

Bad weather simplifies the baseball team's
problems. They seem to have enough talent to win,
but they're only human—they need practice. If the
mitters get it, this University might be able to
soberly enjoy a winning team.’

four genuine threats for indi-
vidual titles in Unangst, Dick
Shildt (130), Ron Schuchert
(137). and Terry Hoover (heavy-
weight). High finishes fro in
those four. and a couple upsets
from the likes of Jim Rhone
(152), Larry Cuba, (145), and

Paul Allen. (191) .,coii1a lead the ‘

varsity to a suprising finish.

As assistant coach Bob Fehrs
said, “Navy’s out ahead of
everybody. After them any-
thing could happen. ‘No other
team has enough balance or
standouts to definitely finish
second.” A

One other side-light of the

Easterns is its effect on recruit- 4

ins. Adams didn’t feel that this
year’s results would have much
effect on his recruiting, but that
next year’s might.

“Not too much is expected of
us this year,” Adams remark-
ed. “Should Penn State win,
they probably would try and
use it to their advantage, And
they should use it.

“If Navy won,” Adams con-
tinued, “I’m sure it would help
them, but it wouldn't hurt us
as much in -our recruiting as

it would if Penn State wins.”’

The True Story

Damn Embarassed
  Four Minute Man

by GEORGE LIES
Asst. Sports Editor

The announcement pointed-out yet another blemish on
another poor season. And it stood out like mud on a clean

face.

The Pittsburgh Basketball Writers named Ken Bollens the
Best Pitt Player to Appear at the Field House this sea-
son. Bollens was chosen for his performance against Tem-
ple, when on a December night, the Panthers upset the NIT-

bound Owls by 17 points.

IT WAS ONLY the fourth game of the season, but

A three games later, Bollens ceased to be a regular.

Bollen became the four-minute man. That is, he played
each of the 22 games, but only in the ﬁnal four minutes

of each game.

N 0 one really knows why

_KEN BOLLENS
Four minute regular.
thers’ blue, hardwood bench became very uncomfortable,
especially in the last four minutes of each game.

Bollens was benched. It may
have been because of his ter-
rible showing in the Miami
(Fla.) game. It may have
been because Bollens was
still weak after a bout with
the ﬂu over Christmas. Or
it may have been something
he said, or something he did.
Bob Timmons reasoned
that Bollens “lacked the
quickness and the defensive
ability.” Bollens was playing
in his last season and may-
be Timmons wanted the
sophomores to play more.

IN FACT, Bollens played
only the ﬁnal four minutes
in his last game in uniform
against West Virginia.

Timmons, the former bas-
ketball coach, wasn’t a sen-
timentalist. He played to
win. (His coaching record
for 15 years was 177 wins
and 189 losses.)

Even Bollens really didn’t
know why he was benched.
He just knew that the Pan-

“It was damn embarrassing,” Bollens said over the
telephone. “We'd be behind by 10 or 12 points with four
minutes to go, and then I’d get in the game.” I

“But,’ continued Bollens, “I’m not mad at him. It was

his opinion. And I didn’t agree. I like to think I could do .,

it. I’m not as bad as he makes me out to be.”

“IF HE WAS going with youth.” rationalized Bollens,
“It was the only smart thing to do. He wanted to win.”

And Bollens wanted only to play. “When I got into the
Carnegie Mellon game,” he remembered, “It felt good to
stretch my legs and play again.’,

“He always called on the old-timers when he didn’t
want to be embarassed by the likes of Carnegie,” joked Bol-

lins, who now
draft.

' “I guess I should have talked with him,” Bollens ended,

four minutes later.

Cagers En iml Season

Temple Victory
Brightest Spot

by MIKE BROURMAN
Assistant Sports Editor

Another long season, the
fourth in succession, has
ended for the cagers. As in
the past three, it ended with a
victory over Carnegie-Mellon. As
in the past three, the victory
was one of few. Unlike the past
three, there will be a new coach
at the helm next year.

With the retirement of Bob
Timmons, the big question be-
comes What does his successor
have to look forward to. On pa-
per, the Panthers should be
stronger next year, but that's
what they said about this year.

Instead, the team responded
with -a 7-15 record. Among the
losses were many embarrassing
on-es. Among the victories were
a couple of shining -ones.

Brightest of all was the 81-63
upset over Temple last Decem-
ber in the Field House. In that
game the Panthers put together
two good halves for one of the
few times all year, and com-
pletely dominated the highly
favored Owls.

Despite a ‘height disadvantage
of over two inches a man, the

Top Scorer

cagers beat the bigger Owls on
the boards, forced them out of
their zones with deadly outside
shooting, and won going away.

And,_ there was the Massachu-
setts game. The Panthexs saved
their worst half of the year for
the opener of the Steel Bowl
and trailed 38-18 as they left the
court. But, a scrambling, press-
ing defense swarmed all over
the Redmen in the second per-
iod, and Ken Bollens’ tip-in won
it 73-71 in the last second of
play.

But, the rest of the season,
aside from victories over lesser
schools, was dark. The cagers
were outscored by an average of
ten points a game, but in many
contests it was much worse.

Many questions were aimed
at Timmons along the way,
but he muffled them all with
his resignation. Nevertheless,
there were many things about
this year's cagers that were
puzzling. 2

There was the bench, for in-
stance. In his optimistic presea-
son t-alks, Timmons stressed the
good bench tha-t the Panthers
had. Many fans have, therefore,
wondered why so little use was
made of Ken Bollens, Len Ka-
lata and Bob Petrini in the lat-
ter part of the season.

And, there are the sopho-
mores. One, Bob McFarland was
the team's second leading scorer.

pite limited playing time, ﬁnish-
ed right behind him. Can the
coach improve their play next

year?

If he can, then he may have

a fair nucleus to build around,

especially since high scorer Tony

DeLisio also returns.

That ﬁlls four posit-ions. This‘,

question of them all. If fresh-
man —Bob G-alius cannot do the
job, then the new coach is left
with Paul Naponi-ck and Charlie
Hunt, who need much more
work to be of major-college 
ber.

But, next year's winner, if it
comes, will be too late for the
seniors who have "sat through
four sea-sons wi-t-h a combined
25-67 record.

Shidemantle Strenghtens Routines POWB-rfulo Hawks Clobber
“ In Preparation for April Nationals

Freshmen Offer
Hope for Future

by CHUCK DWORAK

Dave Shidemantle brought
the dismal 1967-68 gymnas-
tics season to a close on its
one glorious note last Saturday
by winning the Eastern long-
horse championship in the EIGL
meets at Navy.

Shidemantle, also the Eastern
vaulting champ in 1966, edged
out Barry Weiner of Temple
and Paul Vexle-r of Penn State
to recapture the crown. “I was
both relieved «and happy to win
it,” said Shide-mantle. "

“The crowd was “Oooh-ing’ af-
ter every good vault I made in
practice. .They were expecting
me to win, and I knew I could
take it with one of my better
performances. There was a lot

of pressure.”

Shidemantle’s victory in the
Easterns qualiﬁes himlfor na-
tional competition on the long-
horse in the NCAA ﬁnals at
Tucson, Ariz., in April. “I be-
lieve I can win or at least place
high in the ntaionals if I throw
my best vaults,” said Shideman-
tle. “You normally need about
a 9.6 or 9.7 to win. I am going
to work on my vault from the
far end of the horse for this
meet. It is tougher and I can
get more points with it.”

' During the regular season
Shidemantle did most of his
vaults from the near end of the
horse, and with considerable
success. He won the vaulting
event eight times in nine meets
and was ranked ﬁrsat in the
East. “I would have to call this
my best season,” said Shideman-
tle. “It was my most injury-free
season, and I was able to do at

Indiana State Gets Revenge,
Downs Rifle Team by Point

The first week-end in March
came in the form of heart-break
toPitt’s winningest varsity team.
Sgt.’ Gilbert Smith’s riﬂe squad
was edged by Indiana State, 1,-
288-1,287, in the closest meat of
the season. The loss sets the
sharpshoo-t-ers record at 9-2.

The 1,287 points scored by the
marksmen represents the high-
est total of the campaign, des-
pite the defeat to an Indiana
team that was hungry for re-
venge of an early season set-
back.

The usually lS"tI‘Ol'Ig team shot
wi.t«h.fgreat_ accuracy in.the loss,
led by Jim Rossner who came
up with 264 points.

Other members of the riﬂe

lot more work on my routines.”

Shidemantle’s feats on the
lonsghorse, however, were among
the few things gym fans could
cheer about this season. The
gym team, operating as a club
this year because they had only
four varsity members, won their
ﬁnst event at Cornell Dec. 2.
They lost their next ten meets
after that, including a 171.65-
107.65 loss to Penn State to
close out the season.

The showing of the freshmen,
however, leaves coach Warren
Neigcr very hopeful about next
year despite the gymnasts’ 1-10
record. “We will definitely be
strong on ﬂoor exercise next
season with Lowell Meek, Dave
Andrew, a.nd Bernie Jesiolow-
ski. Meek was even better than
Shidemantle in some of the
meets,” said Neiger.

“Phil Lilly can give us an 8.5

on the sidehorse, and so can Jim
Bilec. I also hope to team B-ilec
and Lilly with Dennis Rickard
next year on still rings and
parallel bars. Meek is going to
do some work for us on the
trampoline, and Andrew will be
working one a somersault for his
vaulting routine. We have a
good ch-ance to build a winning
team. -
“I also hope to have a fresh-
man schedule next year,” con-
tinued Neiger. “We are getting
more money from the Athletic
Department to recruit, so I will
try to have a schedule of four
or ﬁve meets set up for the
frosh.”

TOURNAMENT SEEDINGS

The important Eastern
Wrestling tournament seedings
were posted this morning. The
top eight wrestlers in each

WPGH, Stay Undefeated

In an overpowering demonstration, the Pitt News
“Hawks” routed the WPGH “_Ki11er-Cycles” in their open-
ing basketball game. The score was 35-34 in overtime.

Roy “.Wally Wonder, formerly
Jumpshot” Jacobs clinched the
victory with a foul shot. When
queried about his new nickname,
“Wally Wonder” s-aid, “My shoot-
ing’s off, so I changed my name
to match my flashy play.”

The outcome was never in
doubt as the “Hawks” ever.
whelmed their taller opposition
with superior rebounding, shoot-
ingfand a zone defense that had
Jack Kraft, the Villanova coach,
taking notes.

Art “The Big E” Rosengarten,
who won the Wilt Chamberlain
Rebounding and Foul Shooting
Award, modestly took all credit
for the “Hawks” victory. “Just
like Wilt, I sacrificed by scor-
ing potential for the good of the
team,” he said.

That brought tears to the eyes
of Jerry “Leroy” Gruebel who
led the “Hawks-” with 16 points.
“You never had a chance __to
score,” yelled’ “Leroy,” “because
I always had the ball.” Never-
theless, “Leroy” won the Billy

the Kid Award for having the
fastest gun.

"The Big E” had 10 points,
while Mike “Hawk”
with 4, “Wally Wonder” with 3,
and Hobie “Warmonger” Harris
with 2, rounded out the scoring.

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein, who
limited his playing in an effort
to keep the score down, was
shutout, but won the Red Auer-
bach Award for coaching his
team, which has never been de-
feated.

After-§_a couple more breathersl,
with S.G. and the Owl, the
“Hawks” move on to bigger and
things. They play UCLA and
Houston on the road. For those
games, the “Hawks” will be bol-
stered by the return of George

Lichtenstein, John “Hatchet” Se-'

Negro Leader Appears

Jordan Views Black Power

Vernon E. Jordan, J~r., direc-
tor of the voter education proj-
ect of the Southern Regional
Council, will speak on ,“O'rg=a~n-
izing Black Political Power -
the Southern Struggle” at the
Graduate School of Public
Health Auditorium Tuesday,
March 18, at 8 pm.

Mr. Jordan, who has been pro-
minently mentioned in South-
ern newspapers as the man m-ost
likely to be Atlanta's ﬁrst Ne-
gno mayor, initiated voted reg-
istration efforts for the Negro
throughout the South.

voter registration drives and
leadership training sessions for
Negro candidates and elected of-
ﬁcials. Based in Atlanta, Ga.,
project work now extends to
ten Southern states.

A 1960 graduate of Howard
University School of Law, Mr.
Jordan served as Georgia ﬁeld
director for the National Asso-

ciation of Colored People

(NAACP) until 1963. He joined
the Southern Regional Council

that year and has held several.

positions within that organiza-
tion.

In 1965, he became attorney-
consultant to the US Office of
Economic Opportunity, Atlanta
regional office. President John-
son aspnporinted him to the White
House conference “To Fulﬁlll
These Rights” in 1966 and later
to the National Advisory Com-
mission on Selective Service.

Sponsored by the University's
Graduate School of Social Work,
the lecture is an addendum to
the Urban Organizing Confer-
ence held by the school last fall.

There will -be no admission
charge for the lecture.

The voter education project of
which he is director was found-
ed in response to the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. It concen-
