Gregory Howard Williams walked
onto a Greyhound bus bound for
Muncie, Indiana as a white 10-year-old
boy, and walked off the bus black.

Williams’ parents uprooted the 10-
year-old, light-skinned African-
American boy who spent his formative
years in a white Virginia suburb, and
took him to live with dark-skinned rel-
atives in Indiana. On the way, his
father broke the news to him.

“In Virginia you were white, but
when you get off the bus in Indiana,
you’ll be black,” Williams said to a
group last night at the Pitt Law School,
referring to his father’s jarring words.

Williams’ contact with his dark-
skinned relatives in Indiana was the
life-changing experience and inspira-
tion for his book, “Life on the Color
Line: The True Story of a White Boy
Who Discovered He Was Black.”

‘Williams, a professor and dean of the

law school at Ohio State University,
spoke at the Pitt Law School last night
about his new book as part of Black
History Month.

 n’t know he was
blackuntil he was lOyears old

As a young child, Williams
watched his life turn rocky as his moth-
er and father argued more and more.
The harsh words often turned into ﬁst
fights and knockouts.

In July 1953 his mother ﬂed to
Washington, D.C. with his younger
brother and sister, Tony and Sissy.

“My mother forgot two things on
her trip — my younger brother Mike
and myself,” Williams said.

By Thanksgiving, Williams -and his
brother were always hungry. He
described what they ate for dinner most
nights —— one big meatball wrapped in
a bed of spaghetti and a piece of bread.

“By time breakfast came, we only
hoped to eat,” Williams said, “The only
food available was the lunch the school
provided.”

Williams shared with the audience
the many times he and his brother went
to school with dirty faces, shaggy hair
and muddy jeans.

“I remember my dad used to give
my brother and I a quarter everyday for
lunch,” Williams said. “Just a year
before that my brother and I carried $5
each to school for lunch.”

Williams said he remembers on

‘with his grandmother.

Jan. 9, 1954 his
father’s 40th birthday
his father, brother
and himself crying most
of the day. ‘
The transition from
riches to rags was too
much for the family to
handle. Less than two
weeks later, the trio left
for Muncie, Ind., on a
Greyhound bus to live

Williams was
always told that his
father was Italian. He
saw his grandmother
many times during
childhood, but never

knew she was his grand- Williams’ father told him they were Italians
m0th6f- He knew her as because they lived in a white neighborhood.’

Miss Sally. ' .
“I remember my father sayin

‘Boys, do you remember Miss Sal1y?”’

Williams said. When he and his broth-

er nodded, his father replied, “Well

she’s your grandmother and my moth-
er.” ,
Miss Sally was a brown-skinned

African-American woman whom he

barely saw or faintly remembered.
Williams said when he got to
Muncie, he noticed his grandmother
was still as stern and angry as he
remembered from his childhood. And
she wasn’t happy to see them.
He overheard her saying to his

Staff Writer

Though they’re conisdered — the
underdogs, members of Pitt’s debate team
hope to upset some of the best talkers in
the country this weekend and eventually
bring home a championship.

The William Pitt. Debating Union
will try to make the National Debate
Tournament District VII Finals in a tour-
nament this weekend at Georgetown
University in Washington D.C.

District VII — Debate’s equivalent of
the Big East Conference —— features
debating powerhouses such as
Georgetown, James Madison, Wake
Forest, George Washington, George
Mason and Liberty Universities, as well
as local rival Duquesne University. _

“We’re going to be seen as underdogs
going into the toumament,” said WPDU
Director of Debate Gordon Mitchell, who
is also an associate professor in Pitt’s
Department of Communication. “We’d
need to be able to defeat more experi-
enced teams. We’ve done so occasionally,
but ‘we need to be able to do so consis-
tently.”

In the run-up to the qualifying tour-
nament, WPDU debaters have performed
very well, said Mitchell, especially 1st
year debaters Chris Burdick, Brendan
Delaney, Phil Elwood, Mark DeNardis,
Eric English and Andrew Stangl, and
sophomore debaters Lisa Corrigan and
Almas Sayeed.

“We have been getting strong perfor-

' mances from our young debaters,” said

Mitchell. “They’ve been holding their
own in a very tough district, against more
experienced opposition, who have at least
a year’s more experience.”

Last season, Delaney and DeNardis
reached the ﬁnal round of a tournament at

Delaney won the honor of 3rd bestgi
speaker at a tournament at George Mason:
University, and Sayeed 8th best speaker at?
a toumament at Navy two weeks ago. 
The WPDU also participates on the;
National Debate circuit, a group of?
schools outside District -VII, and the team:
has debated in tournaments at the;
the?

University ‘of South Carolina.

“It’s been good for the young
debaters to learn what it’s like to compete -
against top teams,” said Mitchell. “And
they learn fastest by getting experience in
this sort of competition.”

In a policy debate, teams of two
debate both sides of an issue, which is
selected by the NDT for a given semester. ..
Before each tournament, teams do not
know which side of the issue tl1ey’ll be a.
arguing. Teams battle each other through
preliminary rounds, usually six matches,;;_
and if they perfonn weH enough (com- 
monly better than a .500 record — more it
wins than losses), they progress to the R
elimination rounds. L

Judges determine the winner by
examining several aspects of the debate,
but the primary consideration is whether ‘-
the argument is convincing. - ‘

When not- out gathering trophies for
the home team, the WPDU sponsors pub-
lic debates with its subgroup — the"
Activist Debate Network. The ADN
brings community leaders, businesspeo— -
ple and policticians to Pitt to debate cur- 
rent local issues. ' ‘ _

The WPDU also visits local schoolsl’;
to introduce the art of debating to high
school and middle school students.

VANDALISM  

» Members of Delta Tau Delta said they

thought the vandals had been thrown out of
a Phi Kappa Theta party. But, Phi Kappa
Theta President Steve Kondijakos said that
was not the case.

“I have no idea who it was,” he said.
“It7s never happened here before.”_

The University—owned parking lot is
adjacent to ' the Phi Kappa Theta house.
Kondijakos said they share it with Delta
Tau Delta, Pi Kappa Phi and Sigma Chi, but
the lot is open to everybody on weekends.
Cars from all four fraternities were dam-
aged.
Deputy Chief Gaiy Moses said the
incident is under investigation.

Pitt Police are also investigating sepa-
rate vandalism incidents occurring between
late Saturday afternoon and early Sunday
morning.

Police apprehended three juvenile
males on Allequippa Street after they were
suspected of breaking into a car parked on
the Robinson Street extension. No arrests
were made. '

Vandals also smashed in the window of
a University owned van. "

Moses said the three incidents were not
connected, but did say the amount of van-
dalism for one day was unusual.

Still under investigation are the events
of Jan. 17 in which seven cars were either
broken into or vandalized during a Pitt
men’s basketball game. '

—Cars were not the only. targets last
weekend. - '

The University-owned book store, The A

Book Center, reported having its front win-
dows scraped Saturday night as well.‘ Police

also apprehended a man who kicked in a ‘

pane of glass on a back door to the store.
Moses said they are looking into the matter
and are not sure ‘if the man responsible for
the back door is the same person who dam-
aged the front windows. ’
Pitt Police responded to a separate
report that a brick was thrown through an
Oakland Avenue apartment window.
Moses said Pitt police are investigating
the incidents but they have made no anests.

uncle Oscar “I ain’t got no room for
those peckerwood kids.”

From the ‘time he and his family
arrived at his grandmother’s home,» a
three—room toolshed with an indoor
toilet and a cot for him and his brother
was his home. I

_ “I slept at one end of the cot and
my brother slept at the other,”
Williams. said. _

Williams said he often thought
about his mother when he was in bed,
half asleep, wondering why she would
drive 600 miles to Washington D.C.
andnever come back for her other two
children.

“My brother and. Ivused to cry
together,” Williams said. “The wounds
of our souls ached.” _

Williams and his brother slept in
the shed for only a short time before a
woman named Miss Dora asked him
and his brother to spend alternating
nights at her house. Williams soon
found out that her invitations created
the opportunity for her to decide which
one of the boys to adopt.

“Miss Dora eventually adopted the
both of us because she couldn’t stand

’ to separate Mike and I,” said Williams.

Miss Dora was a Christian woman
who kept herself active in the church.

Williams said he confided in ‘the
church bishop of his intentions of
becoming a ‘ lawyer. The bishop‘
laughed and said, “Boy, don’t you
know it’s easier for you to get a camel
in a needle’s eye than for a lawyer to
get into heaven?”

Williams said he was fortunate to
have achieved his goal as a lawyer,
having risen from shack he calledia
house in Muncie. .

“I never felt so impotent in my life
ever before,” Williams said. ‘

Williams said he believes that faith
played an important role in his life.

“Without God, I would not have
been able to make it,” Williams said.

Williams said he found his way of
life for a reason, but hasn’t uncovered
that reason yet. Maybe, he said, he’s
supposed to share his story with oth-
ers.

where few people have stood before,”
Williams said. A

Williams has appeared on “The
Oprah Winfrey Show,” “Dateline” and
“Nightline,” telling his story.

As a result of interviews for his
book, his sister Sissy saw him on the
cover of a magazine and for the first
time realized she was black, too.
Williams, Sissy and their brother Tony
have since reunited.

Carla Gary, a-friend and associate
dean of FAS at Pitt, attended the lec-
ture at Pitt and said Williams was

Teaching religion in
the public schools

In Florida, right now, a classroom is being video-
taped as a high school teacher presents a lecture about

the Bible. He is teaching a class called "The Old ,

Testament," meant to be a history class, in a public
school. The videotapes will be used in a legal hearing to
decide whether the course violates the laws separating
churchiand state. '

Opponents of the class argue that it crosses the bor- -
der between history and theology. A citizens advisory»

committee, assembled by the local_schoo1 board, could
not agree on certain aspects of the text, whether it was
historical fact or required religious faith, and critics say
it would not be possible to _teach this course without
making those distinctions. ’

Proponents of the course argue that a reading knowl-
edge of the Bible, or at least parts of it, is essential to
understanding culture in general. They also say that the
course can be taught legally by sticking to the historical
point of view. A _

But the real problem here seems to be just the
reverse of what everybody else is saying: They should
be talking about religion, not trying to bill it as history.

We will probably never all agree on what parts of the
Bible are fact and what parts are Scripture. Trying to

make that distinction is exactly the process of talking _

about faith, which is what we're supposed to avoid,
according to the spirit of the laws which separate church
and state. V , I

On the other hand, it is perfectly safe and reasonable
to talk about religion — if we define it here as an exam-
ination of how people interpret the Bible differently.

For example, if we sit in a classroom and talk about
the difference between Christian, Jewish and Muslim
beliefs, then we are not trampling on anybody's freedom
of religion. In that sense, it would essentially be a litera-
ture class, talking about differences in interpretation.

In a Pitt course called "The Bible as Literature,"
which is taught in this way, young people are typically
willing and able to think in such terms. It is usually the
older, non-traditional students who didn't have such a
class when they were young, know only their own inter-

pretations, and have trouble acknowledging other points

of view. '
Offering classes on religion in high school would be
the perfect time to educate students about cultures out-
side their own and people unlike themselves.

The Pitt News

Peace preferable to propaganda

James Maude
Columnist

The situation continues, the
tension mounts, and the propagan-
da, relentless in its pursuit to condi-
tion the American mind to develop
a "hate the raghead" attitude, is
slapped on thicker than before.

Saddam Hussein still refuses
U.N. weapons. inspector access to
suspected chernical-weapon stor-
age sites. And the United States,
ever so mature in its stance, threat-
ens to ﬁre a few missiles into Iraq if
Saddam does not comply. _

This whole quandary started
last Fall, when Saddam refused to
let the U.S. contingent of the U.N.
weapons inspection team have a
look at certain sites, and the U.S.
reaction has been nothing short of
childish. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Secretary
of Defense William Cohen,‘ don-
ning their best schoolyard bully
smiles, gleefully armounce every
evening that they are one step clos-
er to pounding Iraq, unless diplo-
matic efforts succeed. .

Thus far, most Western nations
have fallen into line with the U.S.
attitude (including Clinton-clone
British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien), and that's understand-
able,‘ as they. have similar interests
in the Middle East: oil.

The West does not appreciate
upstart Middle Eastern types, who

» threaten the supply of oil, and Iraq

wanting to get out of its food—for—oil
deal indicates a desire to get out of
a losing situation. Obviously, some-

‘thing trivial like a refusal to let’

weapons’ inspectors see suspected
weapons sites is the perfect excuse

to allow the West to keep Iraq
own. ~

And the propaganda has been
nothing short of relentless. Iraq
used chemical weapons on Iran
(and the U.S. didn't? Or is napalm a
variation on classic orange juice?),
is using women in the .army (not
assaulting women in the army like
its U.S. counterparts), and is burn-
ing U.S. ﬂags (as if the Stars '11
Stripes means anything other than
an icon of greedy blood-thirsty

I opportunists in the Middle East). .

Cohen, at a. press conference

_ last week, said Hussein would not

be removed from power. In the
same speech, he claimed the United
States would do its best to bring
democracy to the region. Umrn,
which is why it's only bombing
Iraq, but leaving the tin dictator in
power. What wonderful logic.
However, calling Hussein a
victim in this affair would be about

as logical as calling Bill Clinton's ,

sex life squeaky clean. But
Husseirfs being in power would be
more advantageous to the "United
States than an actual republic of the
people. As Shell Oil found in
Nigeria, dictatorships are easy to
pay off, and make exploiting their
countryside a lot easier. _ '
The bloodiest battles in 1991

‘did not occur during the Gulf War,
but directly afterwards when.

Hussein's military (supposedly dis-

’ armed by the Allied Forces)
crushed a Shi'ite rebellion in the.

South. Shi'ite soldiers were denied
access to captured Iraqi stockpiles
by the Allied Forces (ie. the U.S.),
and were easy picking for the "van-
quished" army of Saddam Hussein.

There were also easy times "to"

be had by_ Hussein's government the

THE PIT NWS

following year in dealing with
Kurdish rebels in the North. Kurds
were slaughtered, but no outcry or
support came ﬁom the West, in fear
that such an action may break their
alliance with Turkey, whose gov-
emment makes Hussein's view of
the Kurds look liberal.

Oppression was allowed,

because the United States would
rather favor dealings with a tyrant
than with a government of the peo-
ple. It's a lot easier to bomb a coun-
tryunderadespotthanit is to bomb
a people's republic. K

But why do they feel Iraq is a
threat? Does. the United States.
naively believe Iraq poses a threat
to its neighbors? The only country
in this whole mess that has been
willing to use weapons with psy-
chotic glee has been the United

, States.

South African President
Nelson Mandela suggested that the
United States stop acting like the
world's policeman, and that the sit-

‘ uation in the Persian Gulf should be
left alone, and that countries there ‘

should be left to their own business.

The right-wing contingent
wants U.N. fees to be reduced, yet
wants to exert: more power on the
international front. Right-wingers
also claim that the United Nations is
on a mission to control the United
States. Funny, when the major play-
erintheU.N.happenstobethe
U.S. ~«- ’

Perhaps the United States
should look at despotism within

itself before. complaining about
despotism elsewhere. ’

James Maude, an Englishman, is

, annoyed by his country's stance on

this volatile issue.

Rather than take your atten-

with President Bill Clinton (in case
you have been in Nagano for the

that the entire media world has of
Lewinsky on screen for the

now return you to CBS’ exclusive

What an exciting evening of gut-
wrenching and dramatic bobsled-
ding that unfolded before us today.

one almost died in the skiing event

A1: Yippee! We now turn you over»

to our exclusive CBS coverage of
the ski rim where somebody
wrecked into a barricade and had
to be air-lifted to a hospital. We’re
still trying to determine if this was
done while tossing a water bottle in
a football-type game while the
skier was heading down the slope.
Let’s talk to the helicopter pilot.

copter pilot drinking coﬁee.)

Wages Unfair.

This is in response to Paul Clark's
Feb. 16 column concerning the mainte-
nance workers from.

Mr. Clark, you seem to think that
union people are easily disposed of; so
do most of the big companies today and
their executives. That is why our jobs
are going to Mexico, because people
coming out of colleges think the way
you do. »

Janitors and maintenance workers,
and Pitt employees in particular,
deserve a liveable wage,’ just like those
in higher positions at Pitt deserve,
including Chancellor Nordenberg. One
day, you will be in the workers’ shoes
with a family to feed and clothe, and I
hope you have a union and people
behind you. ‘

Being a non-union Pitt employee, I
see what Pitt pays its non-union
employees. I made $11,748.33 for 1997.
Try to take care of a family on that
salary.

Does Pitt care? Hell no!

People come to work every day, the
work gets done and the University runs.

  

All I want
you to know, Mr.
Clark, is that if you don't have a union
trying to help you out, you're in trouble,
just as non-union employees at Pitt are.
One of these days, Mr. Clark, you'll
wish you had a union behind you when
you are in the real working world. '
I've seen USX lose jobs,
Westinghouse lose jobs, and on and on,
companies cutting jobs to save a buck.
People lose houses and become alco-
holics, and families are broken.
Mr. Clark, we are working at jobs
that are not paying a liveable wage.

Insanity plea sensible

- In  to Carrie Hagefs Feb. 9
column on the insanity plea: ,

Yes, murder is wrong. But the law

makes distinctions on the degree of minder

There is manslaughter, a ruling that does not -

absolve the defendant of all responsibility
but does absolve him of blame, and there is
some degree of punishment involved

A person who does not know the dif-
ference between right and wrong has no
conception of his actions. Take for example,
the case of a child who has not yet learned
that some actions hurt people and that

Letters should be kept to 250
words and must include the writer's
name, phone number. and university

affiliation (if any).

"wrong" exists. If this child hits his parent,
though the intent is not malicious, the child
may be given a time—out so he leams_that
hitting willnot be tolerated by his parent.
Eventually he comes to the understanding
of the concept "wrong" —-unless there is
something wrong witlrhis mind that pro-

’ hibits that development. If the child had hit .

his mother with a knife and somehow killed

her, it would be malicious on the part of the

father to lock the child away for the rest of
his life, beat him, and so on. A

However unfortunate the conse-
quences of his action, the child will not
understand why he is being punished, and_
thus punishment would be absurd. . He
would know not to kill his mother again, but
the problem would not be solved

Iagreethatcriminalspleadingirisanity,

is a defense that is overused. It is easy for
this ‘writer to see how it must be difficultto
rule in cases where sympathy fora defen-
dant and excusing the defendant become
confused In the case of proven insanity,
however, the 1 verdict is straightforward:
Have sympathy for the victims, but forgive
those who truly knew not what they did

Reering
our city's stars

Here’s the challenge.

Some day, when you ﬁnd yourself wan-
lering the streets of downtown Pittsburgh in
search of excitement, stop one of the locals
and ask him two quick questions.

First, ask him who, in his opinion, was
the greatest pitcher to ever grace the mound
for a Pittsburgh franchise.

Second, ask him who, in his opinion,

 

was the greatest hitter to ever grace the bat-

ter’s box for a Pittsburgh franchise.

Two quick questions.

There will be a number of quick
answers, too. Names like Doug Drabek and
Barry Bonds will spring from the lips of the
college crowd. Honus Wagner, Hank
Greenberg, Ralph Kiner, Bill Mazeroski and
Willie Stargell will be the suggestions of the
older, more knowledgeable fans. Dozens of
other famous Pirates may also appear;

Two quick questions. Two quick"

mswers. ~

Two wrong answers. Beyond debate,
two wrong answers.

‘The answer key, for those of you scor-
ing at home:

A. Leroy “Satchel” Paige, Pittsburgh
Crawfords

B. Josh Gibson, Homestead Grays and

Pittsburgh Crawfords

Simple. And, if ever you ﬁnd yourself
faced with questions similar to those posed
above, you better have those names ready.

If not, you aren’t a true baseball fan.

Simple. _ '

February is Black History Month.
During this month, many television stations,
newspapers and classrooms pay special
attention to local African-American notables
and the deeds they have performed for God
and country or for science or for sport.

Usually, somebody tosses the name

‘ Paige around for a few minutes, touches

brieﬂy on Gibson, then cuts to commercial
or starts ﬁelding questions from students in
the back of the room, eager to know ifthis
will be on the test.

For one month, these two sports leg-

I ends almost get their just due. . .
One month. And it isn’t even baseball

season. ,
For those who need it, here’s a brief

A education: Paige pitched for over 30 years,

beginning in the semipro leagues and ﬁnish-
ing his career with the Kansas City A’s in
1965. He was 59 ‘years old when he retired.

Often, he would challenge clubs to
three—inning games involving just Paige and
his catcher. If Satchel gave up so much as ‘a
hit (not a hard thing to give up .witl1out

high 32 points, six of them com-

“Vonteego was just unbeliev-
‘able tonight,” Pitt Head Coach
Ralph VV1llard said. “He just took
the game into his own hands and
decided that we weren’t going to
lose this game.”

Despite his point total,
Cummings dished out eight

his passes was freshman, Ricardo

With the president of the
United States looking on from a

hoops team had possession of the
basketball and a two-point lead
with just over 10 seconds remain-

last night. _

On the inbounds pass,
Vonteego Cummings was double-

dribble out of the pressure, he
stepped out of bounds with 9.3
seconds to play, giving the Hoyas
one last chance to tie or even win.

The slugger once hit the clock in old
Comiskey Park with a home I'l1Il — the
clock that used to sit high above the center-
ﬁeld scoreboard. And, despite the tries of
Maris, Ruth and Mantle, Gibson is still the
only human ever to hit a ball out of Yankee
Stadium (not just over the fence, but out into
the street) during a game..

Of course, he did it during a Negro

_ League game. Many have used that as an

excuse. The records of Paige and Gibson, as

well as countless others, were set at Negro

League games. '
The pitching was worse. The hitting

1 was worse. Everything was worse. The

records don’t mean as much. .

Critics say such things as if the players
of the era had a choice. Even the dullest crit-
ic knows, they didn’t.

Throughout this month, you will
undoubtedly hear a story or two. about
Paige’s and Gibson’s exploits. You may
even see a movie or catch an old newsreel
about them oncable TV. Your history pro-
fessor might mention them in passing.

Brief glimpses of the two players and
the Negro Leagues. That’s all.

So here’s another challenge:

Take the rest of the month and read
about Paige and Gibson. Read about the
Negro Leagues and their players. Read
about what they’ ve done for_Pittsburgh and
for baseball and for sport. If you want, let the
reading spill into March or April or longer.

1 Then ask yourself if the records mean
nothing, like critics suggest Ask yourself
whether Paige and’Gibson deserve to be
mentioned not just in the same breath with
Greenberg, Kiner ‘and Bonds, but in the
breath before.

' Two quick questions.
Find the answers yourself.

As for the dribble out of bounds call?

“It wasn’t out of bounds, but it was a
good no-call,” Cummings said. “I
wouldn’t want the ref to make that call
on us in that situation. We’ll just take the
W”

“It is great -that Vonteego put up 32
points and 8 assists, but the biggest thing
is he led the young , guys on the ﬂoor
tonight,” Willard said. ,

He had to lead, because sophomores
Isaac Hawkins and Jarrett Lockhart were
on the bench for most of the game in foul
trouble. Both eventually fouled out late
in the game. 1

The Panthers may have beaten
Georgetown by more points if it weren’t
for the many Hoyatrips to the free-throw
line in the ﬁrst half, when Hawkins and
Lockhart picked up most of their fouls.
The Hoyas pumped in 24 ﬁrst half free-
throws, but that wasn’t enough to fend,
off Pitt. V

“The top three teams [Pitt, Miami,
and Syracuse] are really equally
matched,” Knoles said. “It’s going to
be a really close competition.”

This year’s Pitt team, according-to
Knoles, is very mentally tough, and the
swimmers do not allow themselves to
become intimidated in any matter, even
facing a home meet against the rest of
the conference.

“This year’s team has showed that
when the going gets tough, they step up
and ﬁght,” Knoles said. “They have
been such an easy team to coach this
year. I don’t have to motivate them
before a meet.” —

Although the team championship
is the No. 1 goal for the swimmers,
individual titles are a definite motiva-
tion for all the men.

One of the most dominant swim-

events.

“[Vucetic] is beatable, but you’ll
have to be on the top of your game to
do so,” Knoles said. “Jon did it already,
and he can do it again.”

The championships kick off
Wednesday evening with the ﬁnals of
the 200-yard freestyle and medley

Tomazich to lead the way and be a
strong contender. ‘Isabel Dejo in the

On the diving board Tomazich is
Pitt’s strongest chance of advancing
to the winner’s circle and moving .on
to the next competition: The NCAA.
She ﬁnished eighth in the one- and
three-meter dives at the NCAAs last
season.

Dejo has a chance at the NCAA
event in the freestyle, according to the
coach. She may be the best hope
among the swimmers.~The next four
days will determine who stays home
from the NCAA Championships‘ and
who gets to pack their bags for a little
