PLEDGES JR: ANNOUNCED

 

Push, pep, ‘ pers-istence,‘ personal
contact and generosity were struck
as thekeynotes of the Alumni Bulld-
ing ‘Campaign at a huge‘ rally at the
campaign workers held in the Norse
Room of the Fort Pitt Hotel last
‘Friday night. Joe Thompson presid-
ed. When Joe presides the meeting
moves along ‘with‘a- push and a pep
that carries all before it. And this
meeting -moved in that way.

Colonel Joe introduced Floyd Rose,
’96, as -the rst speaker and Floyd
started the ball rolling in approved
fashion. Before he sat down Floyd
had every worker present not only
anxious to work on the campaign
but equally anxious to -begin the
-work with’ his or her. own generous
subscription. .Next came R. A. Me,-
Cra.-dy, '11, who reported for the
Committee on Advance. Pledges.
“Fifty thousand up '_ tonight and
many excellent prospects still on
the list,” told _McCrady’s story. of
what the ¢Advance Pledge Commit-
tee, or ‘ , ,

of the campaign. Assuring the-
graduates‘ of his school that the
board of trustees had taken deﬁnite
steps ion the erection of atDental
Building, ground for which will be
broken in the spring, Doctor Friesell
uh-en -pointed out that the graduates
'-would’: be told that active support of
Alumni Hall was - considered their
ﬁr.s~t& alumni responsibility. S
-Carlton G. Ketchum, ’16, who is in
charge of __the Alumni Building Cain.-
paign, gave the workers present the
ﬁnal information on the exact na-
ture ot the job of every committee
and every committeeman in the or-
ganization , and ‘emphasized particu-
larly the necessity of the workers
getting into personal contact with
their prospects and then urging gen-
erous giving to the University in
the present crisis. ~
More then 175 earnest, enuthu-sias-
tic workers were present. They
came from every county in Western
Pennsylvania, from Youngstown, 0.,
and other points, where Pitt men
and women are located. Many_ out-
of-town workers were ,unable to get
to the meeting, but’; letters, tele-
grams and telephone calls from most
of them indicated beyond doubt that
