Victim
Scott
awaits word
from Pitt on
aﬂeged

beating

By John Enright
Editor in Chief’

Pitt student Robert M. Scott, the
victim of an alleged beating by
members of the Pitt basketball
team at a party in Oakland early
Saturday morning, said that he's
”waiting to hear from the univer-
sity” concerning the alleged. in-
cident.

The University of Pittsburgh
Athletic Department is investigat-
ing the alleged incident and Pitt
Athletic Director Ed Bozik and
Coach Paul Evans will have
”nothing further to say” until
their investigation is completed,
according to Larry Eldridge, Pitt's
sports information director.

According to a police report-
Scott, 20, was the victim of a
beating by three members of the
Pitt basketball team — Jerome
Lane, Demetreus Gore and Steve
Maslek — at a party on 3821
Dawson St. in the south section
of Oakland at approximately 2
a.m. last Saturday.

The alleged incident stemmed
from Scott’s brother spilling beer

City sues

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

The city of Pittsburgh is suing
Controller Tom Flaherty for
failure to sign city contracts with
the Massaro corporation.

The Massaro corporation was
awarded a $1.6 million contract
to renovate city firehouses. Form-
er Caliguiri aides Paul"Brophy,
Bud McDermitt and Dave Matter
all work for Massaro.

City Solicitor Dan Pellegrini
said that Flaherty had over-
stepped his bounds as controller
when he refused to sign the con-
tracts with Massaro.

Kevin Forsythe, deputy con-
troller and a spokesman for
Flaherty, said that it isn't the job
of the city solicitor to state the
responsibilities of the controller.

”He’s doing it for improper rea-
sons. His job is to co—sign all city
contracts,” said Pellegrini.

According to Forsythe, ”One of
the most important jobs of the

controller is to expose these types-

of raids on the municipal

In response to the charge,
Pellegrini stated, ’’I won't even
dignify that with a comment.
They're just wrong.”

According to Pellegrini, the
reason that Massaro got the con-

tract was because it was the only '

company to submit a bid.

’’It was advertised in The Pitts-
burgh Press and Post-Gazette and
through Dodge one national ba-
sis,” said Pellegrini.

Pellegrini said Massaro was‘

struction and that they may begin

Fall Greek rush 
highest since '60s 

By Marc Duchin

Assistant News Editor

Pitt's 1987 fall rush has
reached its highest number
since the 19605, according to
Bridget Guernsey, Greek
advisor.

’’I think what it says about
rush in general is that most of
the people rushing are real in-
terested in joining,” said
Guernsey. ,

Pitt fraternities and sororities
have been practicing a dry
rush policy since the fall of
1986.

’»’I think the fraternities are
gettingto know a little bit
more about the pledges,” said
Guernsey. ”Before, when you
had a party with 300 people,
you could barely figure out

 

        

let;

alone find out more {about
them.” 1

Guernsey went on to say
that 75 to 80 percent of the
students who pledgeda frater-
nity where freshmen. Also, the
majority of fraternities report-
ed an acceptance of-95 per-
cent of their bids.

”The only reason that this.‘

year's [rush] numbers are larg-
er than last year's is that a lot
of people were stubborn about
last year's rush and were dead
set on dry rush not working,”
said Jim Sluck, president of the

ylnterfraternity Council.

”When they [fraternities]

turned around and really,

worked on their rush program-
ming, gthey improved their

own programs and improved"
rush as a..whol_e,”'~',Sluckv

added-,.is

DENVER — u.s. Rep. Patricia
Schroeder Monday announced
that she will not seek the 1988

.Democratic presidential nomi-
- nation.

Schroeder, 47, told the crowd

L gathered in the city's Civic Center

Park: ’’I learned a lot about
America, and I learned a lot
about Pat Schroeder [this sum-
mer]. That’s why I will not be a
candidate for president. I could
not figure out_how to run.”

At this point she stopped,
breaking into tears and wiping
her face with a handkerchief.

  Then she went on, ”There must

be a way, but I haven't figured it
out yet.”
’’I could not bear to turn every

V human contact into a photo op-

portunity,” she added.

’ Her decision leaves five an-
nounced candidates and one un-
announced contender in the
Democratic field. Rep. Richard

 ';.Gephardt of Missouri, Sens. Paul

Simon of Illinois and Albert Core
of Tennessee, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis and form-
er Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt
have declared their candidacies,

and civil rights activist Jesse Jack-

MOSCOW -— The Soviet capi-

The energetic, 56-year-old

public eye since he took charge

2‘/2 years of Leonid I. Brezhnev,
Yuri V. Andropov and Konstantin

But he has not been seen on

gained the upper hand.

Tehran Radio, monitored in
Nicosia, reported in a terse an-
nouncement that Hashemi was
shot at 6 a.m.

Until hisarrest last October on
the orders of Iran's powerful
Parliament speaker, Hashemi Raf-
sanjani, Hashemi was the chief
lieutenant of Ayatollah ‘Hussein
Ali Montazeri, 55.

Montazeri is Rafsanjani’s polit-
ical rival. Khomeini, Iran's lead-
er and revolutionary patriarch,
chose Montazeri as his successor
two years ago.

Hashemi’s associates leaked
word that Rafsanjani was dealing
secretly with the United States to
trade weapons for hostages held
by Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem

. extremists in Lebanon. The dis-

closure acutely embarrassed Raf-
sanjani.

His execution, despite Mon-
tazeri’s intercession with Khomei-
ni, ‘was seen as boosting «the
standing of Rafsanjani. The
speaker is the most powerful
figure in Iran after the 87-year-old
Khomeini.

The left-leaning Rafsanjani
leads a faction that wants to end
Iran's isolation. '

B 1-Bbomber crashes;
3 cre wmen missing

LA JUNTA, Colo. — A Bl-B
bomber with six crew members
on board crashed Monday during
a training mission near this
eastern Colorado community, but
three crew members parachuted
to safety before the plane went
down, authorities said.

The other three crew members
were unaccounted for, officials
said.

The crash was the first ever for
a regular production model of the
Bl-B, although a prototype of the
bomber crashed in August 1984
in the Mojave Desert of Califor-
nia. One man was killed and two
others seriously injured in that ac-
cident. 6'

-The bomber took off from ‘

Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene,
Texas, early Monday morning,
bound for the Strategic Training
Range Complex near La Junta,
about 60 miles southeast of Pueb-
lo, the Strategic Air Command
said. '

Woman’-s wiles too
wild for boyfriend

Q: My girlfriend is 10 years
younger than I am, but I don't
think that is the problem. The big
problem is that I really don't
want to leave her — she's a great
companion, stimulating intellec-
tually, a professional musician.
I'm proud of her. The one big
trouble is in bed.

Once we ‘get in bed, she goes
wild, andl never know if I'll get

‘ a knee in the groin or an elbow

in the solar plexus. It's like being
in bed with the Three Stooges.
She has much better control with
a cello between her legs. I want
this relationship, but the sex part
is ruining it. Can I suggest that we

have a sexless relationship? I feel .

sure it would hurt her, but I think
it may be the only way to save
what we have between us.

A: You are absolutely right that
it would hurt her, and I think you
would be foolishly giving up
something that is potentially
wonderful. But you do have to
say something to her —— at the
very least, to avoid being maimed
or sexually incapacitated! Only
not that she is terrible in bed, not
that she turns sex into a terrorist
attack. That would not help.

Speak to her some day, when
you and she are happy together,
definitely not in bed or just before
or after sex because that is the
wrong time to bring up a sexual
issue with a lover. At that time it
is a blow, when a lover thinks
things are wonderful, ecstatic, to
be told something is really not

good about her performance.

Select a time when she has less
excited feelings, is more recep-
tive to suggestions. Then tell her
that sex with her is so stimulating
that she is so wildly desirable be-
cause she herself becomes so
wildly excited.

But that you would love it if she
could help you a little to play
your lover's part because as

things go now, you feel that you

have no control at all.

DR. RUTH
WESTI-IEINIER

Q: I am a 65-year-old woman
with growrrchildren, but I don't
know what an orgasm is. That is,
I am not sure. I get into argu-
ments with my two friends about
this. They say it is a feeling in the
clitoris. I say it is in the uterus. I
say it starts like a tensing of the
muscles, perhaps like the male
erection, and then a throbbing
and complete feeling of giving
and opening up -—‘ perhaps like

the male ejaculation. The first

time I had this was with the birth
of my first child. Do women who
have never had children have to
settle for clitoral orgasm?

A: It is not a question of your
being right and your friends be-
ing wrong. What you have here
is a good example of how this
marvelous moment is something
different for different women.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday; September 29, I987

Scott

Continued from page 1

on the leg of Maslek at the party.
A friend of‘Scott’s fought Maslek
in the apartment and Maslek left
at approximately II p.m. Friday
night.

Maslek returned two hours
later with Gore, Lane and about
four or five other males in four
cars according to the police
report.

Scott was allegedly kicked and
punched by Maslek, Gore, Lane
and a few others several times
and he suffered bruised ribs, cuts
and other injuries, according to
the police report.

Last night Scott said that the
three aforementioned players
were the only people he recog-
nized,«but he thinks some of the
other people who hit him may
have been members of the Pitt
basketball team. ’’If they didn't
play basketball for Pitt then they
played ball for some school be-.
cause they were pretty big guys,”
said Scott.

Initial reports by eye witnesses
stated that Rod Brookin, a

6-‘foot-5 sophomore on the Pitt

basketball team, was at the scene
of the alleged incident, but El-
dridge said Brookin was off cam-
pus Friday night.

Scott said yesterday that a few
friends told him Brookin was
there, but Scott doesn't remem-
ber ever seeing him at the scene.

Scott is still shocked by the en-

tire incident. ”|t’s all Maslek’s-

fault. Why these other guys did
what they did, I'm not going to
conjecture. [Maslek] wasn't invit-
ed to the party, he just knew

' about it. I was thoroughly sur-

prised. Come on, this-guy [Mas-
lek] is 6-foot-9. Him alone would
have been able to kick my ass
and that would have been a bad
scene, but to go get the rest of his
boys to do it. I don't understand
It."

Meanwhile Lane, a 6—foot—6
junior who led the country in re-
bounding last season, was the

only of the three players who

reportedly suffered an injury in
the fight. A spokeswoman at Pres-
byterian University Hospital said
last night that Lane was treated
and released at 3:25 p.m. on
Saturday.

The nature of Lane's treatment
could not be determined, but
Lane was seen walking around
the Pitt campus yesterday with a
ace bandage on his left arm, ex-
tending from his shoulder to his
wrist.

Scott said he has sought out le-
gal counsel and has been instruct-
ed to remain silent about the
nature of the action he may take.-
He would not say whether he
would press charges against Mas-
lek, Gore or Lane. .

”The ball is in [the university's]
court now and I'm going to wait

to see what they're going to do.
As far as what .we do, it's going
to be up to what the university
does from here on out. If they
plan on contacting us soon, then

we may try to resolve this. If not,

then we're going to do what we
have to do,” said Scott.

-While the university athletic
department said they're in-
vesitigating the incident, Scott
said he hasn't been contacted.
"Nobody has contacted me.'[The
university] is suppossed to have
been quoteduabout an investiga-
tion, but I don't know how they
are when the victims haven't
been contacted.”

Scott said that the possibility of
transferring has already entered
his mind because of the publici-
ty surrounding the alleged inci-
dent. "I want to get out of this
unscathed. I don't want to have
to transfer, [but] that's what it
looks like I'm going to have to do.

”My name is all over the radio,
television and newspapers. If
some guys who don't even know
[the alleged attackers] — who just
like Pitt basketball — find out [the
victim's] me,_who knows...

"[Transferring] just entered my
mind. I've always liked this
university and I want to get my
degree here, but if it comes down
to it I'm going to have no other
choice. I know they know where
I live and who's to keep them
from having one of their friends,
when I'm walking down the
street going to class, run up and
cold—cock me and then just keep
running."

Scott emphasized that he
doesn't want to- ruin possible
professional basketball careers for
Lane or Gore, but he's doing this
to make a point. ”This is crazy,
but I have to do what I have to
do. I have to stand up for my
rights. This is America. You just
can't go around beating people
up like that.”

While a report on local televi-
sion last night said that Scott has
until Thursday to decide whether
or not to press charges, he
doesn't think that's the case.

For now, he's just waiting for
the university to make a move.
’'I’m just waiting to hear from [the
university] and they better con-
tact me. I don't know what the
proper channels are. Hey, I'm a
student here too, and I'm the vic-
tim. [The university] doesn’t give
me a scholarship. I don't have a
free ride for all this stuff. I got beat
up by people that they give a free
ride to, and they're giving au-
tomobiles to, and they're giving
apartments to. I gotto pay, my
dad's got to pay for [school]. If
[the university] isn't going to try
to clear this up, then I'll take this
thing as. far as I possibly can.”

tributed to this report.)

Monkey

Continued from page 1

The monkey has been on the
run since July 23, when he and
two other macaques jumped the
moat at the zoo’s Monkey Island
while a keeper was shooting a
fourth monkey with a tranquiliz-

er dart. The two others returned
the next day.

Alfie has crossed the Alleghe-
ny River and has been spotted
about a dozen times in Alleghe-
ny and Beaver counties since.

Introducing Buckets of Rolling Rock Ponies 

 

 

 ,Wiliiam Young
. f Staff ‘Writer

When O'Neill Sanford took

' 1 ; over as the director of bands at
_  the University of Pittsburgh in the

 summer of 1985, he was left with
" “ little to work.

His predecessor had left the
band in a declining state of health
with few assets to work with and
a football season looming on the

l 0‘ horizon. He quickly formed his

band, took them to summer

gig camp and emerged with a march-

ing band markedly better than the

.'one he had been left with.

Two years later, he has brought
the Pitt's marching band up to

if ‘ standards that he feels are on par

with much larger marching bands

 such as Ohio State's and Penn
'.f_,State's. He admitted, though, that
~‘_...‘.;-he had not tackled every
"-"problem.

"We need a strong symphonic
band program,” Sanford said.
"There was no symphonic band
when I came and throughout my
first year. A symphonic band pro-
gram is like a weight program to
a football team — the players
have to keep practicing their in-

- struments in the off-season, or
, they get weak and have to rebuild

everything during band camp.

I "We need a solution to that

program.”
Sanford believes that band at-

~_§ titude is much better now than
-..1._when he took over and that this
_ is a major factor in the revitaliza-
,'tion of the band. .
"I think we are far better in ev-
1 ery way than we were two years
75 ago," Sanford said. "Attitude,
 commitment to excellence and
1 musicianship are all

much
stronger than they were when I
initially took over. The players try

harder to excel now; they are

more committed.
”We definitely execute better
than before, and our sound had

I i:mproved tremendously because
I  of the commitment. We also have
I much better musicians now than
two years ago. They are much
I“ more talented, and they practice
“ more often because they want to

perform better.”

Good musicians are vital to
Sanford’s program since he feels
that they not only are one of the
most important aspects of a
marching band, but that they also
attract good players to the band.

"We are looking for the best
musicians we can find," Sanford

~ stated. ”Most students that come

to us come from good high
schools with strong band pro-
grams. ! would say that most of
our players rate between a five
and a nine on a scale of one
through 10, which is very good
for us.”

The problems with his musi-
cians, Sanford admitted, is that he
doesn’t have enough of them to
let the band sound as full as he
would like.

”We.don't have any depth in
some of our instruments,” said
Sanford. "We only have 18 trum-

pets, and we need two or even.

three times as many to really get

the sound across. We're not large ,

enough to really sound full when
we perform.

"We need some more players
so that when we're out there we
can come across better to the fans
— and also to give some players
a small rest because performing
is very physical, and you get tired
when you're out there marching
around and blowing into an in-
strument."

The size problem is one with
which Sanford has had nearly no
luck since he arrived at Pitt. The
band has only grown 15 to 20
players in two years, and he
needs about 80 more to really
have a free hand to perform.

He already admitted that he
takes every caliber of musician
that comes to him and that he
tries to strengthen the weaker
ones by tailoring the music they
play to their talent and slowly
building them up;

He hopes that the success of
the football team will spill over
to the band as it did in the '70s
when the band had a full comple-
ment, and the football team was
winning seasons and going to
bowl games.

The Pitt Marching Band takes a turn for the better under latestldirector O'Neill Sanford.

"That's one problem we really
haven't been able to solve.
We've been out recruiting at high
schools, which we really couldn't
do my first year because we just
weren't good enough,” said San-
ford. "But now we are a much
better band and are capable of

going to high school festivals and
playing for them, which, I think,
is a big influence on some stu-
dents to come to Pitt and join our
band." ' .

One small measure of_ success
can be seen by the sales of
records and tapes that Sanford

had the band record, something
the Pitt band hasn't done in 20
years. Out of a printing of 3,000
albums and 1,500 tapes, all of the
tapes and 2,000 of the albums
have sold.

Sanford is very optimistic about

Puppets satirize celebrities

By Jerry Buck

Association Press Writer_ '

LOS ANGELES — What has
four hands, three heads and a
mouth guaranteed to poke fun at
a person in the news. The life-size

A puppets on brothers Sid an.d

Marty Krofft’s D.C. Follies.
' .’.’We'll tackle whatever's in the

news," said Marty Krofft. "We

can build a puppet in 36 hours.
Whatever’s happening and
whoever's making news, that's
what we'll spoof.” Thefirst-show
inthe syndicated series will ap-
pear this weekend on 190

.. stations. V

The obvious household "names,
from President Reagan to Pope
John Paul II to Oliver North, will
make frequent appearances on

the show. It takes two people to
manipulate each puppet, one for
the hands and gone for the head.
A third person supplies the voice.
The setting is a fictional han-
gout across from the White
House called D.C. Follies, where
Fred Willard is the real-liferbar-
tender and host of the show.
"We're starting out with 20
puppets," said Sid. "We also
have Andy Rooney, Don King,
Woody Allen, Oprah Winfrey,
Tammy Bakker, Geraldo Rivera
and Vanna White. We also have
one of Dan Rather which appears

on the TV set in the bar. He'll be

constantly changing clothes, hair-
style and the like."

Other puppets for early shows
are former presidents Richard M.
Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Gerald

‘Gorbachev,

R. Ford, plus first lady Nancy Rea-
gan, former national security ad-
viser John Poindexter, British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatch-
er, former pro football coach John
Madden, Soviet leader Mikhail
Princess Diana,
Michael Jackson, Jesse Jackson
and actors Jack Nicholson and
Sean Penn.

"We'l| have a guest star each
week," said Marty. "Martin

going to try to get some people
in the news. We went after
Ronald Reagan Jr., but he turned
us down. He said he didn't want

ing to get [former] House Speak-

The Mercy Seat
The Mercy Seat
Slash

Wow! Zena Von Heppin-
stall! Wow!

Have you ever wondered
what would happen if punk
was hybridized with gospel.
I haven't, until now. I mean,
I've heard of Stryper and all
those other Ch ristian-metal
things, but I never thought
of them as viable in any
sense of the word. Now, by
the grace of Zena Von Hep-
pinstall we have The Mer-
cy Seat and their self-titled
debut album.

The music is a cross be-
tween old—time gospel and
fresh punk urgency. Clock-
ing in at a breakneck 34

the inspiration

minutes, this album is one
of the most soulful render-
ings of this year.

In my book, Zena Von
Heppinstall's voice rivals
Aretha Franklin's voice to
the point of surpassing it
(not too hard after last year's
release from Franklin). Pop
music can have Whitney
Houston and Anita Baker,
I'd rather listen to Zena any-
time as she has more feel-
ing than any of the above.

I'm not trying to degrade
Whitney and Anita, they're
great singers, but they just
don't feel the music like
Zena does (Aretha's cover
of "Jumpin' Jack Flash"
proves that she's been pret-

Ity numb recently).

The songs range from

Von Heppinstall's original ""

compositions _to punked
covers of gospel standards.
One of the most beautiful
songs on The Mercy Seat is
the moving ballad "Mother
Talking." Flute, congas and
acoustic guitars provide a
serene atmosphere for Ze-
na's jazzy interpretation.
An interesting side note is
that Gordon Cano, former-
ly of the Violent Femmes,
plays guitar and sings back-
up on this album. The most
surprising thing is that there
are no Gano originals to be
found here. Could it be that
he's waiting for the next
Femmes project? If not, he's
founda great band in The
Mercy Seat.

Yupped-up jazz is

Rubaja and Hernandez
High Plateaux
Windham Hill Records

Welcome to the upper—middle
class, please collect your chevre,
waterbiscuits and zinfandel at the
door. And don't forget your
Windham Hill CD collection —
what would a ”yuppie” -be
without it.

Rubaja and Hernandez have
succeeded in perpetuating the
Windham Hill myth of beautiful
music for beautiful people on
their debutWindham Hill album
High Plateaux. The antiseptic
production and digitally perfect
sound offers little more than
precalculated melodies that
you've heard before but just can't
place.

Don't get me wrong, it's all
very pleasant, but I like a little
more excitement to my ”jazz.”
Even just a tiny bit of spontanei-
ty would make me elated, but
alas, none is to be found here. I
‘understand now why Windham
Hill disclaims its jazz stylists as
just good musicians making
”good” music instead ofjazz mu-
sicians performing jazz.

The music is pleasant, and the
instrumentation is credible, mix-

ing hispanic rhythms with rock
sensibilities, but the overall effect
is that of saccharine. It leaves you
with the feeling that you haven't
really digested anything. I can't
help but think of High Plateaux
as one of those 30-minute works
of art that a painter creates live on
PBS. It looks nice, but it isn't a
Rembrandt or even remotely in-
genius. It's just an image of colors
flowing in and out of each other.
This sterility seems to be Wind-
ham Hill's trademark and major
flaw.

too dull

The best tracks on High
Plateaux are melodically familiar,
while the worst are merely sonic
filler and background Muzak.
~”Oro Blanco” sounds reminis-
cent to Peter Gabriel's “San Jacin-
to” combined with his ”Don’t
Give Up.”

This album is for those who
have a wine and cheese taste. For
those who, like me, enjoy beer
and pretzels, get Peter Gabriel's
Birdy soundtrack. It has more guts
and inspiration by far.

 Indians and a new way of seeing

Ia}.

 

Editor's Note: The Naked City
is a place. It hasn't yet appeared
on a map, but that could change.
Paul, well, just think of him as the
tour guide, the dude at the front
of the bus. The name has been
used before, but we felt it was ap-
propriate enough to warrant its
adoption.

It seemed to us that there was
a need to embrace a wider spec-
trum of issues in the Perspective
section. The Naked City is the
place to which we look for new

A ideas. Maybe a brief description
of the city's topography is in
order.

I In the city, things are not long
and drawn out. Academic debate
over the fine, seemingly irrele-

'vant points is unheard of. The in-
tention is not to make a point, but
to see other points.

There are times we read some-

, thing and say, ”That’s really in-
teresting,” or ”Hey, that really
makes sense.” Usually, the rea-

- sons such things appeal to us are

buried too deeply to explain.
Those are the ideas residing in
the Naked City.

There will be no format for this
column, nor will there be any res-
trictions on subject matter, ex-
cept those dictated by libel laws.
Any reader finding something in-
teresting, a poem, a piece of a
speech, something written on a
bathroom wa/lor an idea he or
she has, should be sent to 447
William Pitt Union, addressed to
Paul Anater.

It is our hope that we can

stimulate, encourage and chroni-‘

cle new ideas or old ideas whose
time has come. Or maybe, we

3 P can just have some fun.

hoot owl calls out to the stars.
From a hill in the distance comes
the unmistakable sound of Indi-
an drums and song.

Sound far fetched? Not really.
The above scene actually oc-
cured to my tentmate and me last
Saturday night.

While the rest of you were puk-
ing in the alley behind Zelda's,
my tentmate and I were attend-
ing the ninth annual Native
American Pow—Wow in nearby
Dorseyville, Pa.

Talk about a crash course in
culture. Neither of us had really
been exposed to native American
cultures before, which made the
weekend all the more education-
al and enjoyable.

We got ‘to Dorseyville late
Saturday afternoon. The festivities
had started a noon the same day.
We were obviously late, so we
hurried to set up our camp.

With that out of the way, we
proceeded to the main arena
where the day's native American
dancing competition was being
held.

So passed the rest of the day.
The competition seemed a little
touristy, and I began to doubt the
authenticity of the whole event.
It seemed that the dancers were
performing for the nice white
people's donations, and that was
it. '

I was dead wrong.

only non-native Americans who

learned some lessons that every-
one should have the opportunity
to experience.

As the sun set, we built a large
bonfire at the crest of a hill. Some
people brought up their drums,
and for the rest of the night we
learned . to sing lroquoi,
Cherokee, Taino, Blackfoot and
many other tribal songs. The
main reason for these Pow—Wows
is not to get donations, as I had
previously,_ mistakenly thought.
These ‘people get_together to pass
on to the young what was passed
on to them. Since" my tentmate
and I are also young, there was
no distinction made between the
young native Americans and us.

We did stand out, but our hosts
made every attempt to share their
cultures and make us feel com-
fortable.

We met some incredible peo-
ple, and heard equally incredible
stories. Stories of life spent in har-
mony with the Earth. Stories of
the immense suffering endured
by ancestors as well as contem-
poraries. We heard frightening
accounts of life on the reserva-
tions; the blatant violations of hu-
man rights that have happened in
the past, and most disturbing to
me, the same violations that con-

, tinue today.

Something that I will never for-

'_ get is’ the face of an old Cherokee ’
when he learned" that we had

decided to camp out just to learn
about native Americans. ’{That’s

self. He was the same man who
invited us to sit behind the drum
and learn to play it. He tried to
teach us to sing, but the song was
too far away. Perhaps at the next
Pow—Wow. ‘

We left the fire at about 2 a.m.
and walked back to our tent. We
talked about the day and were
amazed at how little we knew.

Sleep came easily. A sky full of
stars, the owl and distant drums
guaranteed that. I lay in the tent
with my eyes closed. For a mo-
ment, I was no longer 20 miles

‘from Pittsburgh. I was a world

away, in a time even further re-
moved than that.

The temperature plummeted,
and we froze later that night, but
I really didn't mind.

The next day held the same ac-
tivities as the previous. As the bus
loadsof day trippers began to ar-
rive, I couldn't help but feel su-
perior. My tentmate and I looked
like we had spent the night in a
tent. I was proud of my unshaven

face, my unbrushed teeth, and I‘

was proud of the fact that I had
forgotten my deodorant and con-
sequently smelled to high
heaven. That has nothing to do
with what I had learned the night
before, but I felt that my sloven-
liness set me apart somehow.

The tour bus folks are to be
commended for their interest, but
a passing glimpse would never
give them a full picture. I don't
claim to have a full picture either,
but I've seen and embraced a cul-
ture. The embrace was too fleet-
ing to be satisfying. It left me with
a hunger for more. I want to
know more about these all-too-
overlooked people.

Look for the Pow-Wow next

' year. If you can't wait that long,

Dealing with our lesser legacies

Waste problems are not all the
makings of people in leadership
positions now. They are
problems left us by our ancestors
in their pursuit of an industrial
world. It is the legacy of a rapid- —
ly increasing population.

But fault can't even be a con-
sideration. It may not be our fault,
but it is our problem. We, and
those who come after us, will
have to live with the specter of ,a
poorly planned empire. If we are
to survive and leave our decen-
dants a situation better than ours,
something will have to be done.

The legislature has begun to do
its part with the proposed legis-
lation, but there is much more in-
volved. g

Each of us has to make a con- V
scious effort _to better the mess
around us, whether we recycle,
pick up trash or only support
those willing to act.

gle character.

’’I knew that Windmills of the

A Cods would be about a woman

ambassador,” he said. ’’I didn't
know who she was, what the sto-
ry would be.” . _

The story, Sheldon’s eighth
novel and fifth mini—series, turned
into a thriller about a female
professor from the Midwest who
becomes involved in internation-

al terrorism and a behind—the-
A scenes attempt to manipulate the

world powers.

CBS will show the four—hour
mini-series in February. Jaclyn
Smith, starring in her third Shel-
don mini—series, plays the ambas-
sador, and Robert Wagner plays
a career diplomat whom she sus-
pects of trying to undermine her
attempt to establish better rela-
tions with Rumania. V

Sheldon is executive producer
of the series, which has just com-
pleted filming at the -Dino de
Laurentiis Studio in North
Carolina. J

’’I start with just a character,”
Sheldon said. ”For If Tomorrow
Comes, I knew it would be about
a womancon artist. Rage ofAn-
gels would be about a woman at-
torney.” ,

H_is previous mini-series were
Rage of Angels, Master of the
Game, If Tomorrow Comes and

TV mini-series war

Rage of Angels, Part II. All his
other novels have been made
into movies, except Stranger in
the Mirror. But NBC has bought
the film rights for a TV movie. His
nearest rival for the most mini-
series is author Judith Krantz,
who has had four.

Sheldon has also completed
the first draft of a new book,
Sands of Time. He will say only
that it's about ”three women in
trouble.”

’’I enjoy women; I love wom-
en,” he said. ”They’re more com-
plex, more vulnerable. Put a
woman in jeopardy, and it's more
entertaining. You know James
Bond will getout of it, but you're
not sure about a woman.”

Writing novels is a relatively
new endeavor for Sheldon, who
won an Academy Award for writ-
ing The Bachelor and the Bobby
Soxer, a Tony for the Broadway
show Redhead and created such
TV series as The Patty Duke
Show, I Dream of Jeannie and
Hart to Hart. ‘

He wrote his first book, The

Naked Face, while at the same-

time writing every script for I
Dream of Jeannie.

Sheldon talked about his books
and mini-series before taking off
for a month's visit to Spain to
research Sands of Time. His
books always have international
settings, and he goes to each
locale so that he can write ac-
curately and also give the reader
a sense of being there. '

Panther

By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

You could almost call Pitt's
strong safety Billy Owens The
Playboy of the Western World.

At least he wouldn’t mind.

An All—American candidate. A
pre—season All—East pick by both
The Sporting News and Street
and Smith's. A Fifth team All-
American by The Football News.

And, a first team member of the
Playboy All America team.

Has this success gone to his
head?

”A little bit,” Owens said in a '

recent interview, ”but not much.
I'm still the same old person I
used to be. It's just that some peo-
ple think I'm getting better, and
I'm not going to complain when
they say stuff like that.”
Owens came to Pitt in 1983
from the Christian Brothers
Academy in Syracuse, N.Y.,
where he earned three letters in
football. He said he always knew
football was for him. -
”I used to just dream about
playing football for a big school,”
he said. ”When I found out I

could come to Pitt, it made me .-

very happy.
”And it still does,” he added.

While seeing him play, it

seems he should be making quite

a few Pitt football fans happy as
well. ’
He has started at strong safety
in all of Pitt's four games this sea-
son and to date has 33 tackles, 21
unassisted. He also has one hur-

ry, one sack and caused three '

fumbles.

As the last few seconds of the
Pitt vs. West Virginia game ticked
by, it was obvious to anyone that
Pitt would emerge out of the con-
test the victor.

As the final buzzer went off,
the scoreboard read: Pitt-6, West
Virginia-3. The players ran into
the locker room, those from West

Virginia moping, those from Pitt

ecstatic.
All except one.

Craig ”Ironhead” Heyward, a

player who had gone beyond the
limit with his share of the work
during that particular game and
quite arguably the game's true
star, simply pushed his way quiet-
ly through the mass of fans and
reporters without hootering or
jumping for joy. I'm sure he was
glad that his team won, but there
was something on his face that

Perhaps it was due to fatigue,

Now, I'm certainly not one to

the school look good. But there
was something on Saturday. in
that brooding bash of boredom,
professing to be a football game,
that prompts me to ask this
question.

Was it really a win?
For the Pitt defense, you would

have to say it was. All of them,‘

linemen and linebackers alike,
played at peak form, at least for
the better part of the first three

quarters. They truly deserve the,

honors accorded them.

PITTSBURGH (AP) - Univer-
sjty of Pittsburgh Coach Mike
Gottfried says senior Sal Genilla
will keep his quarterback’s job
despite the Panthers’ inability to
score a touchdown in their 6-3
victory at West Virginia.

The Panthers, 3-1, managed
only two field goals by Jeff Van-
Horne as Genilla struggled to

 

 
   
     
  

mount a passing attack, complet-
ing 7 of 18 passes for 72 yards.
His longest completion was for
14 yards.

”I thought Sal played pretty
well,” Gottfried said. ”You’ve got
to give West Virginia credit. Sal's
played veryjwell.” ,

Genilla’s backup, Larry Wanke,
didn't warm up on the sidelines

during Saturday's game.

”The last two games have been
tight games and Coach Gottfried
wants to stick’with Sal in tight sit-
uations,” Wanke said. ”That’s
what he's doing and that's all
right. I want to win. That's all I
want to do.”

Genilla said he was ”out of
sync” against West Virginia,

Gottfried keeping the faith with Genilla

which is 1-3 and lost to the Pan-
thers 48-16 Iast season.

”The linebackers were coming
and, at the beginning, our line
had trouble blocking them,”
Genilla said. ”But after that, it
was a mental thing. I got hit ev-
ery time I threw the ball. It was
kind of getting to me.”

”We’re not scoring points but

great alternative. I

that rest from the pill
  is no big deal.

Semicid" works—without hormones. So it‘s a great alternative
if your doctor tells you to take that break from the pill. You see.’
Semicid has the spermicide doctors recommend most. And it-s
approximately as effective as vaginal foam contraceptives in actual
use. but is not as effective as the pill or IUD. (Some Semicid users
experience irritation in using the product. For best .protection against
pregnancy. follow package directions. And it’s essential to insert
Semicid at least ﬁfteen minutes before intercourse.) Now you can avoid
hormones without giving up convenience. With Semicid.

we're winning games,” said
Wanke, a redshirt freshman from
Cleveland. ”The offense is going
to come together. I guarantee it.”

Pitt lost to Temple 24-21 before
beating West Virginia.

”I don't see any reason why
we're not scoring,” Genilla said.
”We’re trying to do our best.
We've got a lot of neat plays in.
We're going to have days where
the offense doesn't go.”

The-No. 3 quarterback, fresh-
man Darnell Dickerson, hasn't
played and has been told by as-
sistant coach Mike Dickens he-
probably will be redshirted. ‘

’’It would be best for me’ to-be
redshirted,” Dickerson said. ”It

“would give me an extra year.

There's no reason for me to get
upset.”

Pitt is at home Saturday against
Boston College, 2-2. The Pan-
thers’ Oct. 10 home game against
Notre. Dame has been moved
from from a 1:30 p.rn. EDT _to a

7:30 p.m. EDT starting time so it

can be televised by ESPN.

Owens-—

Continued from page 11 ,

At this past weekend's game
against West Virginia, he found .
what he wanted.

. ”Billy is really progressing dur-
ing each game very well and he
is one of the best a||—around play-
ers we have on this team,” said
Gottfried. ”One of the best things
about him is his speed. He can
really run like crazy if you want
him to.”

Owens has his own views on
this. After this past weekend's
game versus WVU, which he
thinks Pitt deservedly won but
had a few too many mistakes, he
had this to say.

”When I'm on the field, I like
to be in total control, and when
I make a break for a run, it feels
the best when lcan just go. I like
that a lot. _

”The one thing about the team
this year is that we just have to
concentrate a little more,” he
continued. ”We’re a good team,
a darned good team. The mis-
takes we make make us look bad,

. or, rather.not as good as we

should look.

”But I don't think we should
have any big problems down the
road. All we have to do is con-
centrate.”

Owens’ good feelings trans-
verse themselves not only to
Gottfried, but to his own personal
coach as well.

”He has all the tools needed for
a good safety and has a very
bright future,” said secondary
coach and defensive coordinator
John Fox. ‘

But just what direction is this
future headed for him? He gradu-
ated this past summer from Pitt
with a degree in information
science and is currently attending
the Graduate School of Business
(he is playing football because of
the fact he missed his sophomore
season with a'knee injury).

’’I don't know,” he said.

C THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, September 29, I987

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) ~ The
way Tyronne Stowe sees it, cross-
ing NFL picket lines can't be any
more hazardous than blocking for
Craig ”Ironhead” Heyward.

Stowe, a linebacker for the
Pittsburgh Steelers’ strikebreaking
team, grew up in a rough-and-
tumble section of Passaic, N.J.,
with Heyward, the University of

L Pittsburgh's megasized tailback.

The two were teammates at

‘Passaic High when Heyward

weighed —— as Stowe says — a
svelte 240 pounds, or at least 20
pounds less than he does now.
Heyward has rushed for at least
100 yards in Pitt's first four games
and has become the Panthers’
most productive back since Tony
Dorsett.

”Craig always was a big guy
and I mean b—i—g, even when he
was 12 years old,” said Stowe.
”You’ve heard of Magi//a Goril-
la. That's the way he looked. He
was too big to play midget foot-
ball, but we finally decided to put

_ him in a game. It was the funni-

est thing you ever saw.

”He didn't have a chinstrap -
why do you think they call him
lronhead. Just look at the size of
his head. His helmet was barely
sitting on the top of his head. His
shoulder pads were way too
small. His jersey was way too
small. We'd just give him the ball
and five, six guys would try to
tackle him. They'd all be hanging
on, trying to pull him down. Oh
my, it was something.”

Heyward rushed for 5,142
yards and scored 74 touchdowns
in leading Passaic to three New
Jersey prep championships. The
6-foot—1, 230-pound Stowe was
one of his blockers, then started
three seasons at linebacker for
Rutgers, where he set a record for
career tackles.

”l was a year older than Iron in
high school and I was playing
running back. Then Iron came in

and they told me, ‘You're now a

tackle.’ I hadto work hard at be-
coming a good player, but he just
had all this natural ability,” Stowe
said. ’’It’s just phenomenal, be-
cause he has it all. He's 260 now
and the speed is still there."

Early in his Pitt career, Hey-
ward was suspended for a season
for striking another student with
a crutch and was involved in an
altercation with a 12-year-old
paper boy. But ”most of his
problems haven't been his fault,”
Stowe said.

”Craig has a big mouth but he
knows when to shut it up. He's
a little bit outgoing and some-
times people take that the wrong
way. He's been able to stay away
from things that could make him
look bad. A lot of the things that
happened, he didn't start,” Stowe
said.

- Christian Okoye, the Kansas
City Chiefs’ 253-pound rookie
from Azusa Pacific, is the only
NFL running back with size and
speed comparable to Heyward.

”But if he (Okoye) was a
second—round draft choice, Iron’s
got to be the first pick on the first
round,” Stowe said. ”When I see

him play, I want to say, ‘Hey, I've
known that guy for a long time,
this guy's great. Wait until you
see how great he is.’

”The scouts rely too much on
computers. The computer says a
.guy that big shouldn't be able to
run the way he does. The com-
puter tells you I don't have the
size or speed to play linebacker,
but the computer doesn't play,

and I can. (Temple's) Paul Palmer
said I was the best linebacker he
ever played against,” he said.

Stowe, signed as a free agent,
was cut during the San Diego
Chargers’ training camp.

”We like him very much,” said
Steelers linebacker coach Jed
Hughes. ”He has good instincts,
is tough and intelligent. He loves
the game and is a student of the

Meanwhile, striking S/teelers
again remained away from the
strike team's afternoon workout
Monday at Point Stadium. Play-
er representative Tunch Ilkin said
no picket lines will be formed un-
til the strikebreakers move their

practices to Three Ri.vers Stadium ‘  ‘

in Pittsburgh next week.

 A .PHILADELPHIA -
-0 "I Schmidtwould like to know if the
‘ Philadelphia Phillies want his,

‘. By Ralph Bernstein
*  Sports Writer

Mike

.296 average, 34 homers and 109
RBI or someone who talks a lot

i‘ of leadership but doesn't show it

on the field.
~ Schmidt was reacting to com-
ments by Phillies president Bill

' I: Giles, who described Schmidt as
« moody and said the National
‘ "League All-Star third baseman

doesn't provide leadership.
Contract negotiations come up
next month,iand Schmidt has al-

’ ready said he won't settle for less

than the $2.1 million he got this
year. He said he really would like
more.’ "

”I’m going in there worthy of
a raise,” said Schmidt, who be-
lieves he's turned in one of the
best five performances in the
league this year.

"Schmidt, who observed his
38th birthday Sunday, also

, warned that he will start heading

toward retirement if Giles plans
to play a lot of games in negoti-
ations.

Schmidt didn't want to talk

' ’ about the contract negotiations in

any detail. What he did want to
discuss, and did so at length, was
Giles’ comments about personal-
ity and leadership.

He also responded to a remark
attributed to former manager John

/ Felsketthat the Phillies wouldn't

have’ a" leader until Schmidt
retired.

 

”First, to say that if we had a
leader, we’d win is absolutely
ridiculous.‘And, to say ‘we won't
have a leader until I retire, any-
body within the confines of this
clubhouse would have to snick-
er, said Schmidt.

”Is Dale Murphy a leader? He
doesn't say a thing. In the club-
house, he goes about his busi-
ness. He does a job. Jack Clark is
the same way. Andre Dawson is
a very quiet guy.

”lt’s the mouthy guys, the guys
who are always pranking and al-
ways seem to be boasting but
don't back up that boasting on
the field. They're leaders?”

Schmidt said he talks and leads
loudest and best on the fieldand,
’’I feel I'm doing that in a quality
way,” not by ”hitting .250 with
150 strikeouts [and] screaming
and yelling at umpires from the
dugout.”

Schmidt said he's done his
leading in his own way.

”I just feel that my value to this
team is 35 home runs, 110 to 1 15
RBI. I do my best to produce that,
and if that's not leadership, then
the heck with it. You got to be
crazy,” he commented.

He also said he hasn't made a V

big fuss about it, but he has ’’had
10 meetings with this team in my
career where I did all the talking.
Nobody knows that. But I have.
And I've said my piece a few
times when I think it needs to be
said,” added Schmidt.

As for Giles’ charge that -he's
moody, he said, ”My mind may
be on the guy who is pitching to-

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, September 29, I987

day, and I may not be in the down to three:

mood to talk about this or that. I
may not have a smile on my face
around the clubhouse. I may
have some problems on the field.
I may be concerned about some
things. What goes on out there on
that field, that's what's on my
mind.

”That’s the way I've been for
15 years, and I'm not going to
change/’ »

Schmidt insists that retirement
at the end of the season is a very
distinct possibility no matter what
he has done on the field this year.
He narrowed the deciding factors

ENTERTAINMENT AND

— What comes of the contract
negotiations.

— What improvements can be
made in the team overall.

— Family considerations.

He eliminated surgically
repaired knees from his list of
considerations, which had been
part of the criteria.

”l’ve had, a very good year

' physically. A pulled muscle, a rib

problem that cost me about 80 at
bats in May.”

”Nobody can say you have to
play baseball until you tail off'or
are physically unable to compete.

cow DRAFTS

Schmidt defends hislow—keyed leadership  

There are players who in the past
have done that,” he said, naming
Willie Mays and Steve Carlton as
two examples.

Many times the reason players
go beyond the best of their career
and play is money. Schmidt said
money is not a worry for him.

’’I’m fortunate enough from a
financial standpoint to be able to
take a realistic look at my life as
a ball player. and judge whether
or not I want to continue,” he
said. ”Maybe I might enjoy do-
ing other things now that I have
the ‘freedom to do so, based on
my timing.”
