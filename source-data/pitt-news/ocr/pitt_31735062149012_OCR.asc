Male Chorus Opens Recital At 8:15 O’Clock

 

Throat remedies and lemons will be at a premium today as 58
gleemen get tuned up for the 46th Men’s Glee Club Home Concert

at the Nixon theater this evening.

The program, featuring ensem-

ble numbers, instrumental novelties, and quartet S011g'S, will start at

8 :15 o ’clock.

The exceptionally heavy demand fo1'O

tickets indicates that a near-capacity
crowd will ﬁle into the downtown
showplace for the annual affair. Tick-
ets may be obtained at either the
Alumni Hall booth or in Room 801, Ca-
thcdral.

Two alumni will ﬁll the guest star
roles, Zareth Yardum contributing a
violin solo, and Andrew Havens offer-
ing a pair of bagpipe tunes. Mr.
Havens will also accompany the un-
dergraduate club in the presentation
of a couple of Scottish, airs.

Forrest Alter, vice president of the
club and accompanist, will play a
piano solo, and the quartet composed
of William Cover, Frank E'ngel, Jack
Clark, and Robert Euwer will sing two
selections.

The club will be heard in 11 num-
bers, with the alumni men's club help-
ing out iii the ﬁnal two offerings,
“Prayer of Thanksgiving” and “Hail
To Pitt.”

of senior graduation announcements,
according to Alfred Dixon, BA, who
has charge of them.

“But we still have room for a great
many photographs,” Dixon hastily add-
ed. “These may be submitted by any-
one, and the best pictures will ﬁnd
their place in the book, besides win-
ning cash awards for their’ takers.”

Snapshots most likely to be accept-
ed will be formal pictures of scenes
around campus which do not contain
people, and they must be glossy prints
in order to be used. Dixon says they
will be selected by the committee in
charge, and that no photographs will
be returned.

Entries in the contest should be
submitted as early as possible, with
the absolute deadline set for this Fri-
day. They may be entered at the of-
ﬁce of the dean of men or may be
given to a member of the committee.

Dixon insisted that “according to
school officials, the unique design for
this book is one of the best in re-
cent years.” The price, as previously
set, will be 25 cents for the cardboard-
covered announcements, and 35 cents
for those with leather covers.

Members of the committee are ask-
ed to watch the columns of The News
for an announcement of a meeting to
be held, according to Dixon, “very
shortly."

At Annual University Affair;
Three Orchestras To Play

P. J, Barnum’s “Greatest Show On
Earth,” if present in Pittsburgh this
Wednesday, would have to take a back
corner to all the attractions added to
University’s ﬂood-postponed Military
Ball slated on the Tech campus VVed-
nesday evening.

The dance committee_ in the latest
move, has added a ﬂoor show with all
the trimmings of a regular night club

entertainment. Seven different attrac-
tions will be included in the ﬂoor.
show.

First, there is Bill Smith, who will
act as master of ceremonies during the

evening. In turn, he will introduce
the other entertainers: Gypsy Nina,
songster - and accordianist; Harriet

Caperton and Charles Columbus, danc-
ers; the Park Avenue Promenaders;
Tommy Gott, the trumpet swing music
player; the VVahoo Girl; and as the
comedian, Johnnnie Cook.

Smith, the m. c., will present the
show during the intermission of the
dance, which will be at the Carnegie
Tech gym from 10 to 2 o'clock.

The new dance site offers 22,000 feet
of dancing space, which the commit-
tee offers as another ballyhoo point.
Harold Stern, Carl Eddy, and Fran
Eichler will furnish the music.

Tickets are still on sale at the same

purchased from members of the ROTC
or at the military department. . . _ .

until 10 o’clock, _ '

Ample parking space, aside from
dancing space, will be assured on the
Tech campus.

Peace Ball Set
For Wednesday

First Annual Dance Will Feature
J immy Bray At Hotel Roosevelt

 

1'

By Ruth Sochatoff

Fitted into the nation-wide expres-
sion of student opinion against war
Wednesday morning is the ﬁrst an-
nual Peace Ball scheduled for Wed-
nesday evening.

The decision to conduct the dance
on that date was made, according to
committee members, a few weeks ago
when the Student Strike Against War
was announced for that date, and the
anamolous situation of a Military Ball
and a Peace Ball scheduled for the
same evening is entirely the result
of the recent ﬂood and rescheduling
of the Military Ball.

Student committees for peace ac-
tion on this campus and at Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Duquesne
University, Frick Teachers’ Training
School, and Pennsylvania College for
W'omen, are cooperating with various
outside peace-dedicated organizations,
in sponsoring the dance.

Priced at $1.50 a couple, advanced
sale, and $2 a couple door sale, the
dance will take place at the Roose-
velt Hotel, Gold Room, with dancing
from 9 to 1 o’clock, supper for two,
and a ﬂoor show. No University af-
fair in recent years has ever offer-
ed so many attractions at the same
price, claims the committee.

Jimmy Bra.y’s 10-piece orchestra,
which has played here for Interfrater-
nity affairs, College Association
dances, and other events, will play.

The primary purpose of the affair,
according to committee members, is
to present an enjoyable dance. The
underlying signiﬁcance of the non-
proﬁt venture is to establish an an-
nual tradition, to dramatize the move-
ment towards and sentiment for peace
action. It is hoped by the group be-

Dr. B. J. Hovde. associate professor of
history, Dr. Harold W. Schoenberger, profes-
sor of English, Dr. James Stinchcomb. assist-
ant professor of classics, Hugh A. Wing, in-
structor in English, Dr. Randolph C. Downr-s,
assistant professor of history, Dr. Max
Schoen, professor and head of the department
of psychology at Carnegie Tech, and many
other faculty members have assented to be
sponsors of the dance.

The student committee here includes Ruth

Fraternity Women Vie
For Panhel Sing Cup

Combining a song, a boast, and a
cheer, fraternity women will try to
capture the cup in the Panhellenic
sing tonight at Heinz House. Fifteen
women’s fraternity groups will vie for
honors before the judges who are Miss
Thyrsa. W. Amos, Miss Helen Poole
Rush, Miss Ellen Geyer, Carl Cass, Dr.
Lotte ‘Lohstoeter, Dr, W. L_ Shelton,
and Miss Mary McKenna.

The merits on which the judges will
base their decision will be the origin-
ality of idea, group spirit, cleverness,
and musical quality.

Esther LeViI1S0I1. Ed37, chairman of
the combined sing and stunt night,
ruled that not more than eight repre-
sentatives, which may include pledges,
will participate from each group.

Song Hits Galore
' Will Feature 29th
Cap, Gown Show

Hulu-Hula Ensembles, Barge-Like
Brogans In Demand As Final
Preparations Are Made

If the predictions of Max Adkins,
new musical arranger for Cap and
Gown, are even a bit better than those
of the weather man, several numbers
from “Out For The Count,” will be
“hits” after the four performances
which begin Vvednesday evening.

“The songs this year have more
variety and sparkle, and are more
likely to be popular than those in the
recent Cap and Gown productions,”
says the local arranger.

Mr. Adkins, who was formerly as-
sociated with the staff orchestra of
radio station KDKA, was responsible
for the arrangements of the two med-
leys of six tunes which went over a
nation-wide network from station
KDKA Friday evening, to the swing
of_Harold Stern’s orchestra from the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association.

The broadcast songs included the
following numbers from the coming
show: “You’ve Got Vvhat It Takes,”
“Sailing -011 the Allegheny,” “Up A
Tree,” ‘‘I’d Do Without,” and,“Ha1'-
lem Numbers Men.”

The arranger will play several in-
struments in the eleven-piece Union
orcliestra, under the direction of Dr.
Benjamin Levant, author of several
of the scores and ﬁrst vice president
of Graduate Cap and Gown.

Costumers are now putting the ﬁn-
ishing touches on the many costumes
needed for the show, from the size
nine and one-half shoes for the “girls"
chorus to the hula-hula costume need-
ed by Abigail Doughbeer for her med-
icine-show dance.

Ten members of the cast and chorus
will give short skits from the show at
Taylor Allderdice High School this
afternoon.

Yesterday, the entire cast held a
dress parade at the Nixon. This after-
noon, the entire show will be re-
hearsed, and tomorrow afternoon the

last rehearsal will be held in full cos-
tume.

For Peace Day

Students Will Assemble At 10:45
For Anti-War Demonstration

With Stephen Raushenbush, former
chief investigator of the Senate Muni-
tions Committee, and Dr, Bernard C.
Clausen, of the First Baptist Church,
as the principal speakers, the second
University Peace Assembly will begin
at 10:45 o'clock and run through until
11:45. Also speaking at the assembly
Will be Dr. B. J. Hovde, professor of
history, and Israel L. Goldberg, C36.

During that time -all University
classes will be excused.

Mr. Raushenbush, in addition to his
work with the Nye Committee, is
chairman of the Pennsylvania Secur-
ity League and former labor mediator
of the Pennsylvania Civil Works Ad-
ministration. In collaboration with
Harry W_ Laidler, co—director of the
League For Industrial Democracy, he
is the author of “Power Control.” He
has also written a number of other
books on this and similar subjects,
one of which is a newly-published nov-
el, “Red Neck,” which deals with the
life of a Pennsylvania coal miner.

Dr_ Clausen is the well-known chair-
man of the Pittsburgh Community For-
um and the weekly radio “Town Meet-
ing” forum over Station KDKA. At
last year’s Peace Assembly he was
one of the principal speakers.

Mr. Raushenbush was secured for
the assembly by Miss Katherine Mo-
nori, C36, who worked in conjunction
with the SFA Peace Assembly Com-
mittee.

Similar to last year’s Assembly, the
peace program this year is a part of
the nation—wide expression of student
opinion against war. During the hour
from 11 to 12 o’clock, it is estimated
that over three hundred thousand stu-
dents will leave classes to participate
in the “student strike against war.”

The SFA committee under the chair-
manship of Herrymon Maurer, C36, in-
cludes: Dr. Florence Teagarden, pro-
fessor of psychology; Roger Hanson,
C36; Edwin Lincoln, Ed37, president
of the YMCA; and Israel L. Goldberg,
C36, managing editor of The News.

Falls Short Of Record

1345 Votes Are Cast As Five Senior Candidates
Fail To Win Reelection To SFA Body;
Edwin Beachler To Head CA

By Herbert Rackoif

Election day .h'i(lay may have been :2 hcciic, exciting session to
many, but its startling resiilts as revealed by the vote count Satur-
day make the actual election seem almost trivial.

From the moment when Martin Barret, BA37, cast the ﬁrst vote
at the Memorial Hall polls at 8:47 o’clock Frida_\' morning _.-rill Sol
H. Cohen, M39, was pulled out of bed to cast the 1,345th vote just
before closing at 5:45 o’clock the same afternoon, there was little
hint of what was in the air.

This ﬁgure indicated a drop of almost 150 from the record vote
of 1,592 cast last year. This decrease might possibly have been caus-

cd by the increased difficulty of voting, but it did not mean a thing
when it came to counting the votes. In fact, where 139 votes were
sufficient for election last year ,it took an average of 162 to elect in
Friday’s balloting.

But in neither case were these opinions correct; for the 106 Dent
votes turned out to be only a drop in the political bucket, andthe en-
gineering ticket also struck a. snag, although "William McQuade, as
expected, led the senior men’s list with a 224 total.

The upshot of it all was that favorites were defeated, dark
horses came -through, and several sure-ﬁre bets barely made the
grade. Of the 13 senior men and women who were members of SFA
last year, only eight were reelected. Those, prc-vote favorites who
wcredefeatcd for reelection include Dale Van Oriner, member of the
SEA executive committee, Louis Bearer, Edwin Lincoln, Florian
Majchrzak, and David Racusin, all of whom were far down the list._

Tenth Junior Position In Question’

But surprises were not conﬁned to the SFA vote. The first
l‘.'Ien",s Council election also showed some unusual results. Particular-
ly startling was the one vote defeat of Donald Pritchard, president
of Delta Tau Delta, by Elmer Schriber, an independent candidate.
Pritchard, in most corners, was considered certain of election. And
College Association came up with the unexpected fact that Edwin
Beachler had repulsed Harvey Goldstein’s powerful bid for the presi-
dency, and had been elected by a 30—vote margin.

\7\7illia.1n Stark led the junior ticket and obtained by far the
greatest number of votes, his total of 269 comparing favorably with
McQuade’s high mark set last year. Lucy Conn, junior woman, drew
238 votes to place next. The strange situation whereby four junior
men had 212 votes or better made it possible for John Baker to be
elected with only 129, although all others needed at least 162 for elec-
tion. The SFA executive committee had some doubt as to this last
junior place, since Ernest Rose was only one vote behind Baker with
128 votes, and was closely followed by Samuel VVerlinich and Charles
\Vright with 124 votes each. A recount has been ordered to insure
the accuracy of this decision.

\Vhat will be the aftermath of the partial defeat of Alpha coali-
tion remains to be seen. The new members will meet for the ﬁrst
time on May 12 to elect their executive committee.

Pitt Poll Resumes Campus Balloting

Pun In The Classroom; Or
R. X. Marks The Papers]

By Shorty Long

With trepidations, ‘ﬂutters, and patter-Pitters, the
members of Professor Robert X. Graham's Journalism
class straggled into the environs of the Cathedral to
partake of an examination in Feature Writing.

“How are your imaginations today?” queried the Pro-
fessor with a Grahamish grin upon his countenance.

Future Florence Fisher Parrys, Damon Runyons, and
Heywood Brouns GROANED in unison, because LIFE is
like that!

“Sad case!” muttered a News reporter, and blinked at

the Blackboards, whereon the substance of the exam
was down in white on black. And Mr. Graham chalked
up another one: Walter. W'inchell we meet again?” It
seemed that the examination was to consist of writing
puns and parodies. Hence, after Mr. Graham had ex-
plained his pun, the prospective members of the jour-
nalistic profession set to work. The professor decided
to take the examination too, just for pun of it. He
happened to sit beside the aforesaid News reporter,
whereupon she requested him to please not copy from
her.

Time Marched On: Bud Beachier chewed viciously
upon the end of his pencil; Helen Rose Gibson sighed
punsively; Ruth Belle Strothers tried to no avail to or-
iginate some pun out of her name; Bill Harvey and
Neff W'ells formed a coalition (Neffer mind, try again
and stick to your puns, boysll; Ruth Horowitz looked
as though she were muttering expletives to herself; I
chuckled because I was telling myself a joke; Jim Nel-
son scratched his head; Torn Locke took :1 running dive
at a few, but looked a bit sunk in spirits; Moorhead,
the journalistic pride of Tarentum, gave up in disgust;
and Charlie Ruch leaped out of his chair as he said,
“Chinese Gambler's Song: Three Yen on a Horse." But
the Long and the Short of it was, “I should study this
:-‘l.fl.€I'Il0Oll, but I want to go roller skating. Get thee be-
hind me, Skatan!” . . Bill Trosen cut class that day.

Here are :1 few gems of the collection:

Malcolm McDonald To Speak
At John Marshall Meeting

V

Session Set For Tomorrow
Evening At Cathedral

Zllansions Room

Judge G. Malcolm McDonald, grad-
uate of the University Law School
class of 1918, returns to campus to-
morrow evening to address John Mar-
shall Club, honorary pre-legal frater-
nity.

VVay back around 1915 a young fel-
low just out of high school applied to
Cornell University for admission to
the three-year law school course, but
he was only 17 years old, and so he
had to enter the four-year course. Dis-
satisﬁed, he left Cornell and matric-
ulated at the University, graduating
in 1918.

In February of 1935, Governor
Earle appointed the then practicing at-
torney to the County Court bench. In
November of the same year,‘Judge
McDonald stood for election and won
——as the ﬁrst judge elected on the
Democratic ticket in 40 years, in Al-
legheny County.

At the fraternity initiation banquet
in Cathedral Mansions, Judge Mc-
Donald will speak on “The Court
System in Pennsylvania.” Frank
Reich, C36, out-going president, will
preside.

New officers for the year 1936-37
will l)e formally initiated at the ban-
quet. The following were elected at
a meeting on Wednesday evening:
president, Hubert Teitlebaum, C37;
Stanley Rogaliner, BA37, vice presi-
dent; Evelyn Lowy, C38, secretary.

Teitlebaum is the out-going vice
president, and Lloyd Gluck, C36, is the
retiring secretary.

Following its business meeting on
Wednesday, the debating team from
Western Reserve University met a
University team. Albert Brandon, C36,
presented a constructive affirmative
speech, and he was cross-questioned
by Russell Connolly, C36. Norman
Sugarman of Reserve presented a con-
structive negative speech, and was
cross-questioned by Irwin Haima.n.

The index of business revealed a
gain of approximately 35 points over
the preceding week and stood at its;
highest level since November 15, 1930.,

A substantially greater than sea-
sonal increase in industrial produc-
tion in the district was primarily re-
sponsible for the boost in the index,
although originating shipments also
reflected a pronounced gain. l

On the other hand. after allowance;
was made for normal increase in re‘:
tail sales for the week immediately
preceding Easter, the combined index
of trade declined. This index_ how-
ever, was still slightly above normal
last week.

The wide gains in steel mill activity
in the district explained the rise in in-
dustrial production which also reached
its highest point since the middle of
November, 1930. ‘

Other industries showing substan-
tial increases were electric power
sales, which rose 4.6 points on the in-
dex; coal production, which advanced
5.4 points on the index; and depart-
ment store sales, which rose 4.5 on
the index. despite the loss of business
owing to the flood.

Intramural Basketball Play
Advances To Finals Tonight

Gathering up the momentum that was lost somewhere in the
middle of a stumbling, dragged-out campaign, the Intramural basket-
ball program streaks into a grand and glorious ﬁnale today and to-
morrow when the University cage championship is decided.

Champions and runners-up of ﬁve diiieerent leagues have been
Gselected for the title eliminations
which began Wednesday. They reach
the semi-ﬁnal stage tonight at Trees
gymnasium and then swing into the
championship windup tomorrow eve-
ning.

In the ﬁrst game at 7 o'clock the
winner of the Phi Delta Theta-Phi

two contests come together tomorrow
evening at 8 o’clock in the ﬁnal battle
on Trees court.

Pre-tourney favorite, Kappa Sigma

In Spring Drills

 

Along with the change in weather,
the coaching staff is contemplating
shifts in positions of several boys be-
fore many more practice sessions go
by. Frank Adams was the ﬁrst boy
to be shifted since the opening ses-
sion,and Friday, Clem Cambal, sopho-
more prospect, was involved in an-
other change.
VVhile Adams, a junior, moved from
end to center, Cambal was transferred
from the snapper-back position to his
old, familiar fullback department.
Both players have now returned to
the positions they started out with in
their freshman years of’ competition.

The signiﬁcance of these shifts
shows the center scrap revolving
around Don Hensley, Adams, Bob Dan-
nies, and Cleon ‘Linderman. In the
end division, Paul Shaw, Frank Sou-
chak, Jim Daddio, Miller, and Al Hoff-
man are now involved in quite a bat-

fullback berths include Bill Stapulis,
Frank Patrick, John Chickerneo, John

In the halfback department, “Curly”
Stebbins and Milt Goldberg, ace soph-
omore prospects, have had cracks at
both wing positions in the backﬁeld.
However, it is indicated that Stebbins
will stick in the left half department,
with Goldberg spending most of his
time at the right position,

Owls, 77-58, In Opener

Eulace Peacock Gets Three Firsts;
Taano Sets Javelin Record.

With only occasional bursts of in-
dividual brilliance to color an impres-
sive squad showing, Coach Olson’s
well-balanced crew shoved off to a
good start in the outdoor campaign
by marking. up,;.its fourth successive.
victory over the Temple Owls, 77-58.

Such world heaters as Al Threadgill
and Eulace Peacock failed to slow the
Pitt squad as several new stadium
and meet records were hung up on a
track that was slow and further handi-
capped by chill breezes which swept
through the ‘Temple stadium.

Eugene Taano tossed the javelin 202
feet, 4 inches for a new Stadium and
meet record. This heave surpassed
the best collegiate mark of the year
by several feet, stamping Taano as an
outstanding prospect for Olympic
trials.

By sweeping the mile and half mile
events, the Panthers helped offset
Peacock’s 16 points, piled up in win-
ning the hundred, 220, and . broad
jump. The national collegiate cham-
pion and world’s record holder breez-
ed to a four-yard victory over Pitt’s

Women Celebrate
Y Silver Jubilee

Dinner In Cathedral Wednesday
To Gommemorate Founding

Students, alumiiae and faculty mem-
bers of YWCA will celebrate the reach-
ing of a major milestone in the career
of the YWCA on the campus at their
Silver Jubilee dinner on VVednesday

at the Faculty Club, 17th floor, Cathe-
dral.

The history of the YWCA dates back
to 1910, when, two years after the
Western University of Pennsylvania
became the University of Pittsburgh,
20 women banded together in the in-
terest of religion and its relation to
the home and college life and formed
a YWCA association.

Student directors in settlement
work, a Christmas party for the settle-
ment children, and active participation
in the annual student loan fund drive
are a few of the major projects spon-
sored by the group.

Officers are Nona Monks, Ed36, pres-
ident; Martha Marsh, Ed36, vice pres-
ident; Mary Frances Brice, Ed36, sec-
retary; Eda Grupen, C37, treasurer;
Gwendolyn Marshﬁeld, Ed37, assistant
treasurer; and Ruth Belle Strothers,
C37, WSGA representative.

In addition to its governing officers,
the YWCA is guided by an advisory
board consisting of Miss Ellen Geyer,
profesor of English and education;
Mrs. John VV. I-Iallock; and Mrs. S. P.
Franklin, The present general secre-
tary is Miss IH-elen C. Battrick, who
has served since 1925.

Eda Grupen is chairman of the com-
mittee planning the banquet. Other
members of the committee are Mary
Frances Brice, Ed36, in charge of post-
ers; Beryl Dimmick, C37, in charge
of tickets; Nona Monks, program,
Emily Chilcote, C37, in charge of cam-
pus publicity; and Nona Monks, in
charge of snapshots.

Marion Clark is the alumnae chair-
man and toastmistress.

Dean Amos To Lead
Panel Meeting Today

“How Science and Religion Supple-
ment Each Other" will be the topic
of a panel discussion to be led by
Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of wo-
men, today at 12:30 o'clock in Room
215, Alumni Hall. Dr. S. P. Franklin,
professor of religious education; Dr.
W. A. Lunden, assistant professor of
sociology; Dr. S, H. Williams, profes-
sor of biology; and Dr. John J. Geise,
assistant professor of history, will take
part. -

This panel discussion has been plan-
ned as a follow-up of the freshman re-
ligious educa.tion program carried on
in the College Orientation classes.

The problem of how to relate the
modern scientiﬁc knowledge that a
student receives in college with the
religious beliefs that he has been
taught all his life, will be discussed.
Dr, Franklin will present the religious
viewpoint on each problem; Dr. Geise,
the historical; Dr. Williams, the bio-
logical; and Dr. Lunden, the sociolog-
ical, M-iss Amos will lead the discus-
sion by askingquestions of the other
members of the panel.

Margaret Lehm, Ed36, and Ethel
Steiner, C38, members of YWCA, and
Estelle Vveiner, Ed36, member of the
YWIHIA, have planned the discussion,
which is being sponsored by the
YWCA and YWHA organizations on
the campus.

Juniors’ Mothers
To Be Entertained
At Tea Wednesday

Now that spring is in the air and

the snow and ice have melted from the,

steps to Heinz House, the women of
the junior class are planning to en-
tertain their mothers at a tea at Heinz
House Vvednesday from 3 to 5 o’clock.

Last year the weather kept some
prospective guests away from the an-
nual tea so this year the date was
set for a later month. All the junior
women have been invited to come and
bring their mothers.

Dorothy Dresser, C, chairman, and
Miss Mary McKenna, class adviser,
are planning a pageant of shawls as
the entertainment. There are to be
shawls of many countries displayed,
some modeled, some hung over
screens as part of the decoration. A
paper will be read concerning valu-
able shawls.

Juniors who must attend the educa-
tion conference are invited to bring
their mothers at 3 o’clock, go to the
conference and come back to the tea.

Miss McKenna will pour. Lois Gail
St. Clair, Ed, is planning the decora-
tions, and Betty McConaghey, Ed,
the refreshments.
