HARRISBURG (AP) — With the
state witnessing a continuous
climb in the number of AIDS vic-
tims, the Health Department on
Monday announced it had estab-
lished a new unit to deal specifi-
cally with prevention and control
of the deadly virus.

The announcement comes
nearly three months after Gov.
Robert P. Casey told the Philadel-
phia Commission on AIDS that
the state would be using a $3 mil-
lion federal grant to develop the
special team to combat the

I disease.

Department officials said it is
hoped the new three-person unit
will enable the state to more ef-
fectively identify, track and assist

victims of the virus while also ex-
panding educational programs,
especially among high—risk
groups such as intravenous drug
users. - ‘

”We have a situation where so
many of our programs have been
scattered throughout the depart-
ment. We’re centralizing it under
one umbrella,” said department
spokesman Gary Froseth, com-
menting on the reorganization.

State Health Secretary N. Mark
Richards, in a statement released
by hisoffice, said, ”By taking the

' team approach, we are putting

our best talent up front where
they can battle this terrible
disease.”

Great Race honoring
late Pittsburgh mayor

By Scot Ross

News Editor

In honor of the time and com-
mitment put into the Great Race
by Richard S. Caliguiri, this year's
running will not only be dedicat-
ed to, but will also feature a spe-
cial award in memory of the late
mayor. 1

Great Race coordinator Mike
Radley said that it was Caliguiri
who first drafted and developed
the idea for the race.

”Twelve, years ago, the mayor
looked at other races in other
large cities and decided that the

city of Pittsburgh should have the ‘

event. He felt that the city
deserved the race. So, he set
forth, in 1978, on the planning
and development of the first
Great Race,” Radley said.

He said that as a tribute to
Caliguiri, the first male and fe-

1 male residents of the city of Pitts-

burgh to cross the finish line will
receive the Richard S. Caliguiri
award, which will be given at the
race from this year on.

Radley explained, ”The race
owes a lot to Dick Caliguiri, We
owe itall to him. He did more for
running in Pittsburgh than any
other man.”

Great Race organizers expect
14,000 participants and with over
10,000 entries already, they are
optimistic about meeting this
goal.

"[The race] serves the recrea-
tional and social needs of the
community,” Radley added.
”There’s something for every-
body in the Great Race.” ‘

Literary award winner McKnight assumes Pitt duties

By Starlett Garner
For The Pitt News

Pitt students now havethe op-
portunity to read the work of
award—winning writer and Pitt in-
structor Reginald McKnight.

McKnight, who recently began
teaching in the University of Pitts-
burgh's English department, had
his novel, Moustaphes Eclipse,
published this month by the

University of Pittsburgh Press. _I

The novel, which captu red the
1988 Drue Heinz Literature Prize
of $7,500, is a collection of 10
short stories which focuses on
black hardships in both America
and Africa. It was chosen from
320 other manuscripts submitted

to the Drue Heinz Literature Prize
committee in July.

McKnight’said his book should
be read ”with an open mind.” He
points out that his book is not au-
tobiographical and that ”you
won't read it looking for secrets
on Reginald McKnight.”

One topic brought up in the
book is the subject of racism.

He explained, ”There is one
story told in the voice of a wom-
an who is a graduate student and
falls in love with a white under-
graduate student. There’s' [also] a
story about a relationship be-

tween a white kid and a black kid

in junior high, and it's about peer
pressure and racism, that sort of
thing.”

Margaret Atwood, who headed
this year's panel of judges,
said/‘These stories display an en-
viable verbal panache, a wacky
inventiveness, and, from time to
time, a directness and honesty
that make you squirm.”

’’I can't imagine,” McKnight
said, ”manuscripts at thislevel
being easy ones. So it must have
been just a couple of stories that
she [Atwood] thought were in-
teresting. Maybe she had the kind
of breakfast that morning that re-
quires the proper readings of my
stories.”

The stories were written be-
tween 1980 and 1987.
McKnight said that one of the

things he wants to do with his sto-
ries is to capture on paper differ-
ent human characters — partly
because that is what he enjoys
doing.

McKnight comes to Pitt with
considerable experience in teach-
ing English and black literature.
He has taught these subjects at
the Arapahoe Community Col-
lege and spent a year teaching
and writing in V Senegal. He
received his masters of arts in En-
glish and creative writing in
1987.

According to Ed Ochester,
director of Pitt's writing program,
McKnight fits in very well with

the other teachers in the writing
program.

McKnight said that the people
at Pitt are warm, friendly and en-
gaging. However, he admits he
was a bit cautious. ”I didn't im-
agine for a moment that everyone
around here is that way, but there
are enough good people around
here.”

He is currently teaching Writ-
ing 52 [Intro to Fiction] and Writ-
ing 171 [Senior Seminar]. He is
a former Marine and Vietnam
Veteran, and now resides in
Squirrel Hill with his wife,
Michelle, and 8-month-old
daughter Rachael.

Philadelphia labor leaders pledge Dukakis support

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —
Philadelphia labor leaders
promised Monday to join
Democratic presidential candi-
date Michael Dukakis in his fight
to win back union members who
deserted the party in droves to
vote for President Reagan.

Dukakis, speaking at the local
hall of the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners of Ameri-
ca, said he would go on the
offense against Republican
nominee George Bush, hitting
the vice president on his past per-
formance on terrorism, drugs,
trade and the national debt.

The speech before about 200
union members kicked off a
three-day campaign swing
designed to focus on national
security, defense and foreign
affairs.

of the Pennsylvania homes test-
ed, the Environmental Protection
Agency said Monday.

The Pennsylvania households
registered some of the highest
readings of the radioactive gas in
the survey, which also included
Arizona, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Missouri, North
Dakota and three Indian reserva-
tions in the Midwest.

Pennsylvania's highest readings
were found in Perry and Lan-
caster counties. But EPA Adminis-
trator Lee Thomas said at a news
conference the problem was so
widespread that virtually all
homeowners should consider
testing.

”Radon is a national health
problem,” Thomas said.

Radon is a colorless and odor-
less gas formed by the decay of
uranium in granite and shale.
Radon is blamed for about
20,000 of the nation's 130,000
deaths from lung cancer each
year

In Pennsylvania, the EPA has
tested 429 homes scientifically

selected to develop a statewide
profile. Of those, 37 percent had
readings of more than four
picocuries per liter. At that level,
the EPA recommends homeown-
ers perform a second test and
consider taking such action as
sealing off basement areas or
modifying ventilation systems.

An exposure level of four
picocuries per liter carries a lung
cancer risk similar to undergoing
200 to 300 chest X-rays per year
or smoking half a pack of
cigarettes per day, according to
the EPA.

Denny Lee Perry, 26, of Ber-

Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh,
where he was reported in critical
condition Monday with burns
over 56 percent of his body.

About a quarter of Perry's burns
were third-degree burns, the
hospital said.

Lynne Shoup, 19, fiancee of
Perry's brother, Louie, said the
brothers found a black snake in
the woods, killed it and ”just
threw it up” into power lines.

The Perry family soon noticed
that the area's power was appar-
ently affected by the dead snake,
Shoup said.

Different World

Transfer students compare previous colleges to Pitt

Imagine being able to attend a
university in the Soviet Union
without having any your of fellow
students know that you are a
transfer from an American col-
lege, a sort of wolf in sheep's
clothing, so to speak.

Then imagine attending a
major Soviet sporting event —
take gymnastics as an example —
and after every point scored by
the U.S.S.R., the crowd breaks
out in a thunderous cry of
"America sucks, U  S  A ..
suck5!”

JESSICA
COLVILLE

Imagine how awful you would
feel knowing that more than 90
percent of those people scream-
ing had never even been to the
United States, yet they were
driven to shout derogatory chants
that, in most of the citizens’ per-
sonal experiences, had no basis
whatsoever.

If you can imagine this
scenario, then you may under-
stand what it felt like for me, a
transfer from Penn State, to attend
my first Pitt football game'last
Saturday, when the Panthers wal-
loped Northern Iowa.

If you were one of the patrons
of this game, then you will under-
stand what I mean by the crowd
erupting into the ”Penn State”
chant after every glorious Pitt
touchdown and score. Ahh  fall
is here and collegiate rivalry is
thick in the air.

Some clarification please 
what exactly constitutes a ”rival-
ry," especially one that is as in-
tense as that between Penn State
University and the University of
Pittsburgh? The trustworthy dic-
tionary describes rivalry as a
competition of two or more peo-
ple for the same goal.

Oh sure, that would satisfy an
English literature professor as a
good explanation, but why don't
we put this in layman's terms?
”I’m the good guy and you're the
bad guy, and I'll do anything I
can to make sure that I win and
you don’t."

This seems to be the easiest ex-
planation; however, it encom-
passes so much more than that,
as we all know. Let's take Pitt vs.
Penn State as a point and case.

First of all, try explaining why
you would ever want to attend
the other ”evi|” university to your
family and friends. The first reac-
tion is that of utter disbelief, and
then it turns into an almost red
rage. ”How could you do that?"
— as if you just announced that
you planned to kill your mother
or your minister.

You then walk around believ-
ing that you have just made the
worst mistake in your life. Then
you begin to imagine what the
reaction will be in your new
school: "Have I just committed
myself to an archaic tarring and
feathering by an angry mob of
students?”

Well, for me, there was no
turning back —— I had to attend the
university that, in the eyes of any
current Penn State student or
alumni, was the purest archetype
of evil known.

The academic transfer to this
university was, for the most part,
relatively easy, except for the
long lines to purchase books and
get on the tuition deferment plan.

It was, however, only two days

p into the fall semester when I ac-

cidentally let it slip to a woman
at the bookstore that I had come
from Penn-State. She immediate-
ly stopped ringing up my pur-
chase to say in a rather loud
voice, ”I don't know if I should
sell these books to you.”

Of course this was all in jest,
but I wonder what her reaction
would have been ifI had told her
I transferred from the University
of San Diego. Would she have
decided not to sell me my books
then?

Then I attended the Pitt game
on Saturday, only to hear thou-
sands of fans tell each other that
Penn State ”sucked." I think that
I, of all people, had the right to
make that clarification, because

I had actually attended the

university in question in the first
place.

Have you ever watched an
episode of the TV series Green
Acres and wondered if some-
one like Eva Gabor would
really have those problems
making the transition from city
to country?

Or maybe you were that one
person who saw the most re-
cent Chevy Chase bomb Fun-
ny Farm and mused aloud that
every city-slicker falls for the
now—cliched ”Dutch—Door
Trick,” you know, the one
where only the top half of the
blasted thing opens, leaving
poor Chevy to trip over the
bottom part?

Although the ”city tool goes
to the country” motif has been
a familiar and funny plot for
some time, I finally found my-
self crossing over in the oppo-
site direction. It was the end of
my third semester at Kenyon
College when I decided to
transfer to Pitt. Kenyon Col-
lege is a small, liberal-arts
school deep in the corn fields
of Gambier, Ohio. With a stu-
dent population of only 1,300
(yes, my high school had more
students too), everyone knew
everyone else. ,

Adjusting to Pitt, a major

university located in the heart S

and lungs of a well-known
city, I thought would be easy
and exciting. I only got the se-
cond part right.

The first problem I met was
moving in. At Kenyon, where
the dorms are only two stories,
the family and I would mere-
ly pick—up the room key from
Jimmy—Bob and his wife Ethel-
bert. At Litchfield Maximum

MARIO
OLIVERIO

Security Towers, I had to prac-
tically get a letter from Gover-
nor Casey just to see the
blasted lobby.

As my father and I walked
through the lobby, which
seems to double as the Grey-
hound bus terminal, I couldn't
believe the human traffic. The
only time I had seen that much
congestion at Kenyon was dur-
ing the Jim Nabors/Burt
Bacharach concert in the
cafeteria.

After two hours of hacking
our way through one human
wave after another, my father
and I made it to the elevator
line. The whole time this was
going on, I was hauling my GE
mini-fridge. Pop looked com-
fortable enough; he was in
charge of the blankets. We fi-
nally made it inside the eleva-
tor cab and enjoyed stopping

onevery floor, telling disgrun— H
tled parents, ”No, we're going '

up." My father and I managed
to get off just five floors higher
than we intended. We
bumped into walls for 40
more minutes before realizing
that we were in the wrong
tower.

As all nightmares -soon must
end, so did my moving day.
The parents left promptly at
midnight and I was looking
forward to a good night's sleep
despite the air conditioning
knob being locked on ”sub-

arctic.” I didn't care. Like
some Jack London protagonist,
I just didn't feel the cold. It
was then that I heard the mus-
ic, loud music. Was it my ra-
dio? No. From the room next
door? No. Across the hall? No.
Then where was this war mus-
ic coming from? Why, from
Zelda's of course. What? The
housing office didn't tell you
that a well-known and fre-
quently visited saloon is situ-
ated just under your window?
It must have slipped their
mind. Actually the music
wasn't that bad. They played
some classic Seger and some
Stones, but when I heard ”In
the Year 2525,” I knew it
would be a long night. At
Kenyon, the only foot-
stompin’ music we played was
Burl Ives, Freddie Fender and
Robert Goulet.

I'd have to say that the most
dangerous obstacles to master
here at Pitt are the streets. I
mean, not only do we have
”traffic," but even when we
have a green light we are
forced to run. Oh sure, at
Kenyon there was the occa-
sional tractor running wild.
Sure, there was cow manure
to be |eap—frogged over, but
not buses, ambulances, taxis
and cop cars to play ”chick-
en" with. ”Hit me and watch
your insurance rates rise!"

But, finally I'm going to a
universitylwith a Division I
football team. Kenyon is Divi-
sion III (a huge compliment to
the coaching staff). At Kenyon,
the biggest football player was

majored in physics and bi-

night, he read poetry at the lo-
cal expresso shop. Offensive
plays were usually named af-
ter classic works of literature.
The quarterback sneak, Look
Homeward, Angel, had to be
the best. Defensive plays were
often christened after psycho-
logical concepts. ”Jung’s the-
ory of Synchronicity" was
shorthand for ”The Blitz.”

I've been here for two
weeks now, and I ‘think I’m
getting used to the campus

”dude” a couple of times and
even said ”sweet” and ”fresh”
once or twice. Hopefully I will
rid myself of the now non-
vogue slang words like
”man,” ”coo|,” ”boss” and
”radical.” it'll take some time,
but I'm learning.

Don’t get me wrong,
Kenyon wasn't totally isolated.
It had running water, electric-
ity and other modern bric—a—
bracs, but the joint still reeked
of ”bucolic.” The place would
shut down on Sundays. Every
third townie was named
”Vern” or ”Uriah,” and the

sight of bovine animals out-
side the classroom window
was a familiar one.

At Pitt, every third student is
named either Mike or John,

So, which life is better — the
placid, Mayberry-like exis-
tence of Kenyon, or the
boisterous, hurly—burly at-
mosphere of Pitt? Though it's
too early to tell, I'm finding
myself falling in love with
Oakland. But no matter which
college you attend, no matter
which city that university may

be located in, there's a tiny bit-

of Kenyon yearning to climb
out.

Continued from page 3

you, I was not above the infantile
judgements of Pitt's ability, or
lack thereof, to play football.
However, the funny thing is, we
Penn State fans do not have an
anti-Pitt chant that we yell after
our touchdowns. So, does that
make you Panthers meaner and
more intimidating than the Lions,
thus making you the bad guys
even more? l can't say exactly.

My initial reaction to the chant
was to stand up and announce
that Penn State did not suck and
that, well, frankly, it was a nice
university; but this urge was
curbed when the vision of the an-
gry mob with its buckets of tar
came into my head. I've kept
quiet, up to this point.

Now let us realize how silly
this rivalry between these two
schools is. First of all, it seems to
be totally based upon the football
teams and their win-loss record.
Speaking from experience, this is
not all of what a university is built
upon.

We could take the surround-
ings of each university (the coun-
try vs. the city), but that is sort of
a surface-based value, and be-
sides, not everyone attending Pitt

loves living and going to school
in the city, and vice versa with
the country and Penn State.

We could take academics, such
as what the ratio of job placement
is for Pitt grads as opposed to
placement of Penn State grads,
but that relies on the job market
and the type of degree you attain
from either university.

So really, what is left other than
sports?

It seems unfair to base your en-
tire perception of a university
upon the physical exertions of a
small number of students, yet it
seems as though no one, myself
included, is above doing this.

This is what is going on folks,
in case you had your head in
your books so much that you
didn't know it was happening
around you.

I'm not advocating the deletion
of rivalry; I'm merely saying we
should look more objectively at
our rivals in areas other than
sports. We might find that we like
each other for what we are rather
than what our respective teams
do to each other on the playing
field.

(By the way, does anyone care
to make a friendly wager on the
Pitt vs. Penn State game?)

Finding the issues in
the presidential race

''I find that kind of action — or even the suggestion that I
engaged peripherally in that kind of effort — to be morally
wrong and totally out of bounds.”

— Frederic Malek, referring to the list of /ewish members of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics be compiled at the request of

then—president Nixon.

Amid the questions surrounding the resignation of Frederic
Malek, former deputy chairman of the Republican National
Committee, after allegations of suspected anti—Semitic activi-
ties, none seems more interesting than the implied one of “What

are we doing here?"

Malek resigned his prestigious position, he said, so that the
Bush campaign would not have to deal with another media
scandal, and would rather be able to focus on "the issues.”
The issues are important, he said; the issues should be at the

heart of the campaign.

In deference to Malek’s honorable resignation, we would like
to do as he asked. The issues, then:

Which of the candidates cares more about family values? Bush
hugs a granddaughter, Dukakis hugs a son. Why doesn't either
of them hug his milkman, a person often mentioned in discus-

sions of lineage?

Does Dukakis say the pledge with more gusto that Bush?

Where was George? Where was Teddy? Where have all the
flowers (flower children?) gone?

Which candidate is faster to roll up his sleeves when he speaks

speaks to Yitzak Shamir?

to unemployed steelworkers? To roll them down when he

What about the deficit? Oh, never mind. That's not one of

the issues.

What drives writers to take padand pen

There have been some times
over the last two years or so when
I've asked myself why I chose
writing as a career. The question
has frequently been phrased as
"Why me?" Not always asked
with my hand over my eyes and
a case of empty beer bottles at my
feet, but sometimes.

Let's face it. Writers are weird.
We have to be. We actually go
out of our way to find out things
that people don't want to have
represented either evenly or at
all. People seek us out to provide
PR for them. Sometimes it feels
like I'm intruding; other times, I
feel used.

Of course it's not all that bad.

It can get worse. I forgot to men-

tion libel suits, writer's burnout,
computers crashing on produc-
tion day and readers who write
rebuttals just to get their names
in print. Those, like having a beer
bill which exceeds my rent, come
with the territory.

"Somebody has to do it." I've

justified delving into investigative
journalism thusly. Someone has
to do it. Actually, it can be quite
rewarding at times. When an ar-
ticle hits the street which doesn't
look like it's been edited by the
Marx Brothers on LSD, when a
small "nice article” note appears
on my desk, whenever invitations
to nifty events start showing up in
the mail, it all seems worth it.

Of course, I'm still in the train-
ing phase as far as being a report-
er goes. After two years here, to
my credit, I haven't shot anyone
in the office yet.

Yeah, it can get hectic up here
on production day, and it's easy
to forget that everyone’s human,
but when some vegetarian edits
what's left of my wit into gibber-
ish, I take it personally.

I said it before. Writers are
weird. We take ourselves serious-
ly, at least for the first few years,
until we learn that no one reads
our columns. They just pick up
the paper for the crossword puz-

THE PITT NEWS

By Craig W. Woshner

For The Pitt News

There were no big surprises
Saturday as the men's cross coun-
try team dominated team and in-
dividual standings at the
California University of Pennsyl-
vania Invitational, soundly defeat-
ing squads from Shippensburg
University and Indiana Universi-
ty of Pennsylvania.

Junior Paul Friedrich led the

way for the Panthers, placing first
with a time of 27:08 for the 5.1
mile course. Placing in the top 10
were sophomore transfer Scott
Humphrey (third at 27:17), senior
Glenn Rhines (fifth at 27:35),
sophomore Craig Woshner (sixth
at 27:39), freshman Jason Bodnar
(seventh at 27:44) and sopho-
more Keith Dowling (eighth at
27:49), giving the team a low to-
tal of 22 points.

Pitt coach Jim Lear was pleased

From Buckeyes to golf,
and other things that
occurred last weekend

Just a few pieces left over from
a sports weekend:

0 By the looks of the Ohio
State—Syracuse game last Satur-
day, the Pitt football team is go-
ing to have a few problems this
week.

The Buckeyes played an almost
perfect game against the Orange-
mlen. OSU gained 306 total
yards, 196 on the ground, and
easily snuffed out most of the
Orange scoring drives. In fact,
Syracuse was inside the Buckeye
30-yard line four times and failed
to score.

   

VINCE
CAREY

The OSU defense looked dis-
ciplined and ready for anything,
while the offense, especially the
running game, easily waltzed
down the field. This could spell
trouble for the Panthers.

0 Believe it or not, but West
Virginia will challenge for the Na-
tional Title this season. Although
they have only played Bowling
Green and Cal State-Fullerton so
far this season, the Mountaineers

look strong.

0 Well, the 1988 NFL schedule
is under way and there are al-
ready signs that it will be a weird
one.

So far, there have been only
two quarterbacks to throw for
over 300 yards in a game. Even
funnier is that they both occurred

J this past Sunday.

Washington QB Doug Wil-
liams (who, by the way, won his
first regular season game as a
starter since 1982) threw for 430
yards against the Steelersgand
Cincy QB Boomer Esiason threw
for 363 yards against the Eagles.

The biggest surprise yesterday
was that Al|—Pro defensive end
Reggie White of the Eagles was
limited to only two tackles
against the Bengals. Unknown
Bengal tackle Joe Walter played
a superb game against White on
the way to the win.

0 It looks like the injury bug
has hit everyone’s favorite team,
the Cleveland Browns. In the first
game, QB Bernie Kosar went
down with a shoulder injury and
is expected to miss four to eight
weeks. This week, back-up Gary
Danielson was lost due to a
broken ankle. That left journey-
man Mike Pagel to take over the
reins. Nothing has happened to
him as of yet, but, just in case, the
Browns have signed veteran Don
Strock to a contract.

0 Two of the top scoring teams
in the NFL the last few years, Mi-
ami and Cleveland, have scored
a combined total of 21 points.
Not exactly winning numbers.

On the other side of the coin,
the Eagles have scored 64 points

with the team's performance.

’’I was very happy with the way
everyone ran together as a pack,"
Lear said. ”That’s what we have
to do this season if we're going
to do well. It really helps every-
one out.

The freshmen also ran well for
the Panthers as three placed in
the top 20.

”The freshmen really surprised J

me with the way they ran,” Lear
said. ”They did as good a job or

better than last year's freshmen
did at this meet —— which is out-
standing.”

The varsity team’s next race
will be at the Malone lnvitation—‘
al in Canton, Ohio, on Sept. 24.

”I’d like for us to be able to do
the same thing as we did at
California, only a little better,”
Lear said. ”For us to do well this
season, were going to have to
run together as a team.

”California wasn't a great test
of our ability, but Malone will be.
It's a rough course, and it's
10,000 meters, not just five
miles,” he added. »

PANTHER NOTES: Other top
20 finishers for Pitt at the CUP In-
vitational included sophomore
Dave Hackworth (15th at 28:10),
freshman Eric Downer (16th at
8:15) and Steve Forrester (20th at
28:30). I

Defensive end Carnel Smith should have his hands full this Saturday night against Ohio State.

and the Raiders have put 59 on
the board.

0 To add to the Dolphins’
problems, QB Dan Marino has
not thrown a touchdown pass yet
this season. Miami coaches and
players will have to get him back
on track if they want to challenge
for a playoff spot.

0 The Major League pennant
races are heating up, or cooling
down. It depends on your point

of view.

The American League West is
just about over. The Oakland A's
will be the winner after holding
off a summer rush from the
defending champion Minnesota
Twins. The only question left is
whether or not they can keep it
up for another four weeks.

The National League East race
is over as well. With all the
problems the New York Mets

have had this season, they are still
the class of the division. Second
place is currently held by the
Pirates, but there is virtually no
way they are going to be able to
make up the 10 games they are
behind.

The National League West
could prove interesting. The Los
Angeles Dodgers lead Houston
by five games, but watch out for

Gowdy makes return to announcer’5 booth

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

This past Sunday, I turned on
the Pittsburgh Steelers-
Washington Redskins game and
proceeded to listen to it. The
reception of the local NBC affili-
ate, WPXI—TV, isn't all that won-
derful in Tower A to begin with,
but that didn't matter. My inten-
tion on this particular day was to
sit back and listen.

A legend was speaking.

For the first time since Super
Bowl XIII, Curt Gowdy was
broadcasting a nationally tele-
vised NFL game. As a part of
NBC’s month-long ”Legends” of
broadcasting project, Gowdy, as

well as Al DeRogatis, Ray Scott,
Paul Hornung, Merle Harmon
and a few others, will be broad-
casting AFC football on Sundays
while the network's regular crew
is in Seoul for the Summer
Olympics.

Gowdy’s voice was as rugged
and dramatic as I had remem-
bered it to be. Yet, as expected,
the man was a little rusty in the
booth at times. And somebody
had to make him pay for it.

Rudy Martzke, TV sports
analyst for USA Today, criticized
the old-timer for saying during
the telecast that QB Jay Schroed-
er had been traded to the Oak-
land Raiders, the error lying in the
fact that Schroeder had indeed

been traded, but to the Los An-
geles Raiders, as since 1982, the
team has pitched beachhouse in
Malibu or something. Martzke
even went as far as to give Gow-
dy a second-place finish for his
dreaded ”Oops Award.”

It was an understandable faux
pas, however, considering that
the Raiders were in Oakland
when Gowdy and his respective
partners, DeRogatis and Don
Meredith, broadcast some of the
most incredible football games
ever played.

For instance, when the Raiders
beat Miami 28-26 in the AFC
1974 playoff on a last-second
desperation pass from a falling
Kenny Stabler to a double-

covered Clarence Davis in the
end zone —~ ”Stabler rolls out to
his left, looking  looking...”

The rest is history.

Or the 1972 playoff between
the Steelers and Oakland, the
game in which the heavens mys-
tically parted over Western Penn-
sylvania and the ”|mmaculate
Reception” took place.

Three Rivers Stadium holds
around 56,000 paid customers.
But in 1988, nearly halfa million
people in the area now claim to
have been present for the Mira-
cle of the North Side.

”Oakland” just goes to show
that Gowdy has a viable memory
and a true sense of respect for
league tradition, when football

was 22 men and a leather ball,
not 22 contract. holdouts and a
slab of artificial turf.

This ”|egend” loyally dis-
regards the ugly business side of
the game and remembers the mo-
ments that have taken place on
100—yard stretches of grass.

Wouldn't surprise me in the
least if Gowdy still considers the
Colts’ hometown as Baltimore,
figuring they've just gone off from
the nest in search of their own
financial independence. The
same is probably true for St.
Louis, not Phoenix.

Los Angeles is synonymous
with the Rams, the Lakers, the
Dodgers, even though old-time

Please see Announcers, page 10

those Astros. The pitching is final-
ly starting to come back and the
Houston lineup is as tough as
anybody’s.

That leaves the always exciting
American League East. Boston
currently holds the top spot, but
three other teams (Detroit, New
York and Milwaukee) are just
around the corner.

The surprise of the division
right now has to be the Brewers.
If the Brew Crew can win the di-
vision, no other playoff team will

U.S. swimmer speaks
out against payments
to Olympic athletes

By Steve Wilstein
AP Sports Writer

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —
America's best swimmer took a
swipe Monday at an unfair sys-
tem of play for pay in the Olym-
pics as a growing number of
countries reportedly planned to
reward medal winners with fat
bonuses.

Matt Biondi heated up a sim-
mering controversy over under-
the—table payments and blatant
pro contracts for Olympians
shortly after the American flag
was raised in the Olympic
Village.

Rival swimmer Jens Peter
Berndt had more political con-
cerns on his mind, as he won a
squabble over his eligibility. The
International Olympic Commit-
tee rejected East Germany’s de-
mand that Berndt be banned from
the Games because he defected
to West Germany in 1985.

While more than 400 athletes
arrived in Seoul, bringing the to-
tal to more than 4,500, five days
before the Games begin, political
issues also were broached by
South Korean President Roh
Tae—woo.

Beset by several violent student
protests last week, Roh said he
expected ”further democratiza-
tion and liberalization of the

country” after the Olympics.

North Koreans will have an op-
portunity to see the Games on tel-
evision for free, if their
government allows, thanks to an
agreement by the IOC to let a
coalition of East-bloc television
companies provide the trans-
mission.

lOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch opened the commit-
tee's 94th session with a speech
that included a blast at the North
Koreans for boycotting the
Games, saying they sacrificed
their athletes for politics.

’’I cannot find words strong
enough to express my regret at
the way in which these athletes,
regarded as insignificant, are thus
unhesitatingly manipulated and
sacrificed to supposedly ‘higher’
interests,” he said. ”Higher than
what, one might ask.”

He also said the IOC needs to
change its rules ”to the world of
today,” and keep a sharp eye on
the ”indispensable but controlled
advent of commercialization” in
sports.

‘ At least seven nations reported-
ly plan to reward their winners
with bonuses, though they’re all
very hush-hush about the money
so far.

gary, Saudi Arabia, France, West

  Where do all the best

sports commentators
practice their trade?

Ray Scott, Al DeRogatis, Curt
Gowdy — considered to be
broadcasting greats in their own
time and probably for all time.
These ”legends” have temporar-
ily come back to the trade that
made them famous, as NBC is ex-
periencing an announcer short-
age due to the Summer
Olympics.

But who are the best, and the
worst, of the current football an-
nouncers on television today?

H DANYLUK

NBC is still loaded with talent
and tradition on its NFL broad-
casts. CBS has a few great voices
working for them, while ABC,
solid on college telecasts, has
reshuffled its Monday night crew
for the umpteenth time and has
finally come up with respectabil-
ity. Here’s how we rate the voices
in the booth: I

THE LEGENDS-TO-BE — ”OH,
MY!”

At NBC, Dick Enberg and Mer-
lin Olsen are the best in the bus-
iness. Enberg could make even a
41-0 blowout seem interesting,
while mi|d—mannered Olsen pro-
vides fantastic insight, based on
his playing days as a member of
the Rams’ Fearsome Foursome.

Pat Summerall and John Madden
are quite comparable for CBS.
Summerall was just as excellent
when he was paired with the un-
derrated Tom Brookshier several
years back. Madden has proved
to be more than a novelty. Keith
Jackson, of ABC’s college foot-
ball, has been around for years,
and for good reasons.

ON ANY GIVEN DAY...

You can listen to these guys for
great, and sometimes controver-
sial, commentary. Don Criqui
and Bob Trumpy are NBC’s
bright young stars, and Charlie
Jones’ talent has kept him around
for plenty of years. Willie Joe
Namath also does a nice job for
NBC. Jack Buck and Hank Stram
are stalwarts for CBS, and Terry
Bradshaw (you remember him,
don't you?) is an up-and—comer.
Brent Musberger is excellent
when in the booth. Frank Gifford,
Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf
have become the right combina-
tion for beleaguered Monday
Night Football. Dierdorf quickly
became a hot commodity during
his brief days with CBS.

Offensive firepower takes over
as Steeler defense heals wounds

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

(AP) — There were times last
season when it seemed like
the Pittsburgh Steelers would
have needed four plays to
score even if their opponent
pulled its defense.

They managed an 8-7
record mostly because of a
physical, young defense that
generated seven touchdowns
and 47 turnovers.

How times have changed.

Now, there's no stopping a
Steelers’ offense that produced
53 points in its first two games,
a veritable landslide of points
for a team that managed to
score 30 points only twice last
season.

But the Steelers are only 1-1
after Sunday's 30-29 loss to
defending Super Bowl cham-
pions, the Washington Red-
skins, mostly because of a
defense that has become

downright offensive — and not
as in scoring points.

”Mistakes are killing us,”
said Steelers coach Chuck
Noll. ”We’ve had coverage er—
rors.  We'd had protection
errors. Everybody’s contribut-
ing an error. We're not going
to play perfect football, but
we've got to make fewer
mistakes.”

The Steelers have allowed
929 yards, 702 passing yards

Olympics  

Continued from page 8
Germany and Malaysia are be-
lieved to have pay-for-play plans,
some as high as $30,000 for a
gold.

Biondi, a contender for seven
medals, said he had virtually no
chance of winning all golds as
Mark Spitz did in 1972 and had
as little likelihood of cashing in
on his performances.

Biondi considers himself the
favorite in the 100—meter
freestyle, in which he holds the
world record, and his U.S. relay
team is favored in the 400
freestyle. The 6—foot—7 Californi-
an says the favorites in his other

 

individual events are Tom lager
of the‘ United States in the 50
freestyle and West Germany's
Michael Gross in the 200 free
and 100 butterfly.

”Maybe the only true amateurs
that are left are in the swimming
program,” Biondi said. ’’I have a
hard time believing that tennis
players who are competing here"
are amateurs. I have a hard time
believing that Carl Lewis is an
amateur.”

The Olympics have all but offi-
cially gone professional for many
sports. Lewis and several other
track and field stars have been
socking away six-figure incomes

THE PITT News, Tuesday, September 13. 1988

for years; tennis pros like Chris
Evert and Mats Wilander also
make hundreds of thousands of
dollars; and basketball players
like Danny Manning are already
signed to hefty NBA contracts.

Biondi has no league to go to
and no rich national federation to
support him. U.S. Swimming, the
organization that oversees the
sport in the United States, is
”years behind other federations
in supporting our athletes,” he
said.

So after these Games, Biondi
plans to leave competitive swim-
ming and concentrate on water
polo for the 1992 Olympics,

 

  pro, male or female, then come
to the Panther Golf Club
meeting on Thursday,

”The money's just notthere so

Evie G. Dennis, chief of the

raising, saying the Olympics have
always been ”more than attempts
at breaking records or the sum of

Doug Williams, the second-
highest total in Redskins’ his-

Instead of covering
receivers, it seems the Steelers’
secondary has mostly been
running for cover.

”We’re doing some things
differently than we did last
year. We have some different
people in there, obviously. 
We wanted to take the run
away from them, hold them
under 100 yards rushing, but
we didn't allow for 400 yards
passing,” Noll said.
