- Panama -

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer F

“Thunder” clapped, waking Carlos
Fitzgerald from his slumber. But the

rumble could not be thunder because it .

was the dry season. Hence, it does not
rain at this time of the year in Panama
where Fitzgerald lives. .
Curious, Fitzgerald and his family got
up and went out to the backyard of
their home in Panama City to see what
was going on. Looking toward the
horizon they recognized artillery ﬁre,
tracer bullets ﬂying around like ﬁreﬂies
in the , night and airplanes and
helicopters buzzing overhead. The
United States was attacking his country.
Fitzgerald, 26, is a Pitt doctoral student
in the department of anthropology and
was in his native land over the holidays
visiting his family during the U.S.
invasion of Panama. Although he
reiterated what the American media

has been saying lately, that the majority .

of ‘Panamanians are happy about the
invasion, he said that he ‘is greatly
disturbed about the U.S. initiative.

“I am against [Panamanian military
dictator Manuel Noriega]. We suffered

for 21 years, but no country should be .

invaded by another for any reason," he
said. ,

He explained that such a move is
damaging to national morale. I

“We shouldn’t have to rely on a
foreign power to solve our problems. It
is a hard blow for Panamanians to
know that we couldn't get rid of Noriega
ourselves. We are an invaded country,"
Fitzgerald said.

Political ideology, however, does not

concern Fitzgerald as much as the
shooting deathof two of his neighbors
by American troops during the attack.

“During the second day of‘ the
invasion, U.S. forces reached a large
shopping center located near my home.
Around this time, two of my neighbors
were out in the street building a barrier

to protect our property from looters. In

an unexplained incident, the »U.S.

soldiers killed my neighbors,” Fitzgerald

said. .
He explained

Though the “grave crimes” committed
by Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife
Elena are centered in faraway Romania,
the history-making execution of the
dictators has hit very close to home for
University of Pittsburgh junior Cristina
Gheorghiu. .

Gheorghiu and her family, who
currently reside in
Greenville, Pa.,

that one rumor
says that someone
fired a shotgun,
and the soldiers

that if he could say
one thing to ’
President. Bush, it
would be to ask
him to investigate this incident and
what he called the many like it

p “I wouldn't say thank you [to Bush].
I or my brother could have been killed
if we were at that barricade at that
moment,” he said.

The Cable News Network reported
Tuesday that the U.S. government had
estimated the civilian deaths total in
Panama to be 220. But Fitzgerald said
that this ﬁgure grossly underestimates
the truth.

“At least 1,000 civilians were killed,"

Fitzgerald said years A [of

C e a u s e s c u ’ s
leadershipl,” said
Gheorghiu. “It
didn’t get really bad

until the 1970s."
_At the time of the Gheorghius’
* emigration, procedures for leaving the A

country were difﬁcult. In order to
leave, one had to ﬁll out an application,
and one person, often a friend of the
family from outside of Romania, paid
the government a fee to compensate
for the person's econorriic worth to the
country. ,

“The price of a person was set by
their occupation and what one was
worth to the government,” said
Gheorghiu.

It cost the Gheorghiu family $10,000
to leave Romania in 1972.

As for Gheorghiu’s view of Ceausescu,
she regards him and his tactics of
leadership as extremely hated and
disturbed. ’

“He was a very neurotic man,” she
said. “He was basically tearing down
Romania bit by bit.”

Ceausescu reportedly had kept an
extensive food supply literally
underground, leaving me public
markets bare. In addition, the countiy’s
supply of electricity was limited, with it
being turned on by Ceausescu for about
one or two hours per day.

“He [Ceausescu] could crawl
underneath the earth by himself and
survive for months if he wanted,” said
Gheorghiu.

Other results of Ceausescu’s
leadership were radiation bombings,
leaving people suffering for months on
end before dying. “It was like you
would be taken into a theater as if

waiting for a movie to begin and then ‘
ewould be contaminated with radiation

as you sat,” said Gheorghiu.
The dictator’s wife, Elena, apparently
told soldiers who were reluctant to

shoot a pregnant woman protester to .

run her down with a tank instead.
“The wife was more disliked than
[Ceausescu] himself,” said Gheorghiu.
Gheorghiu claims that the main goal
of the executions was to simply
overthrow Ceausescu and his personal
leadership tactics rather than
communism itself, which has been the
basis for many student demonstrations
in Romania. . I

In order to honor fallen black
leaders and heighten the
understanding and appreciation
of the efforts of the Black Action
Society and its founders, the group
will sponsor a candlelight vigil
this Sunday in front of the
Cathedral of Learning.

Past and present BAS members
and contributors will speak at the
vigil about important former black
leaders. One of the speakers,
Marta Efﬁnger, said, “We want to
remind students that a lot of
black students would not be here
today if it weren't for the
accomplishments of leaders like
Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
and Dr. Connie Kirnbo. We want
to encourage students to look
back and gain strength
educationally and politically.”

The vigil will mark the 20th
anniversary of the computer room
takeover, inwhich black students,
faculty, and community members

 

joined to form a viable political
unit at Pitt.

The takeover was the first major
step that insured the future of
black students at Pitt. A growing
black student movement that was
sweeping the nation urged 55
black students to act out against
Chancellor Wesley Posvar and
the university by staging a sit-in
in the mainframe computer room,
locking themselves inside for
seven hours. By doing this, the
black students hoped to turn
around the poor and inadequate
treatment they were receiving
from the university.

Universityofficials and students
were shocked by the outbreak,
but didn’t think much would
emerge from the demonstration.
A white junior male said in the
January 16, 1969 edition of the
PittNews, , ‘(The protest] is stupid,
ridiculous and immature; if white
students did that they would be
locked up in jail.”

“You watch,” he added,
“nothing will come of this.”

  Vz'gz'l commemorates BASfonna’z'ng

The student, however; was
wrong. The protesting students
drew national attention and their
demands were met. The university
opened its doors to black students
by establishing a black student
group, which is now the Black
Action Society. It dedicated a
special section of Hillman Library
to black studies, offered better
recruitment for black students
and provided an institution to
assistblackstudentswith ﬁnancial

’ aid and scholarships. , The protest

also established the university's
first observance of Dr. Martin

Luther King Day.
Douglas Ligons, a current
member of the BAS political action

committee, said, “'l'his takeover
enforced a huge turnaround in
the level of recruitment of black
students at Pitt The takeover
twenty years ago made it possible
for all the black students to be
here today.”

To commemorate the takeover

‘and honor past black leaders, Dr.

he said.

When asked why he feels the
figures have been
underestimated, Fitzgerald said,
“History is written by the victors.”

Known as a member of the
opposition to Noriega’s military
government, Fitzgerald said he
feels great contempt for the ousted
leader.

He said that Noriega knew of
plans for the invasion several
months ago and to prepare he
created the Dignity Battalion. The
orders the dictator gave to the
elite ﬁghting group in case of an
invasion were to first open all

businesses in Panama City to
looters; second, to attack and kill
the people in the country who
would not support him; and
finally, to destroy the Panama
Canal, which is controlled by the
United States, Fitzgerald said. He
added that the last two orders
were never carried out.
“Noriega tried to leave Panama
barren for the Americans,” he
added. “I saw the Dignity Battalion
created, and I thought it was a
scare tactic. It was tough to realize
that they were into destruction.”
Fitzgerald described life in
Panama under Noriega: “There
was no free speech; there was no

respect for justice, but the
economy was very‘ good. It was
only very bad in the last year or
so. People were not desperate to
get rid of Noriega. Everyone had
a lot to lose in a civil war. It was
hard like all military dictatorships,
but it wasn’t impossible.”

As an example, he said that
there were never any long lines
for food, and most of the
repression came to very
outspoken opposition leaders —
not to the general public.

“It was much more lenient than
other countries in Latin America,”
Fitzgerald said. However,

and dictate Panama for 21 years.”

Now that Noriega is in U.S.
custody, Fitzgerald said he would
like to see him receive a prompt
trial. He added that he is very
interested in hearing about what
he called the “wheeling and
dealing” Noriega may have had
with the United States since he
was a Central Intelligence Agency
informant in the 1970s and early
19803.

“Why did the U.S. support him
for so long? I don’t like the U.S.
government, butl am not a citizen,
and I would rather not comment
further on that. There’s no use in
being angry.”

“[Ceausescu] had to be taken
care of,” said Gheorghiu. “He could
not have been tried publicly. The
people would have ripped his head
off. He was just hated too much."

The Romanian army lent a hand
to the Romanian people in the
downfall of Ceausescu.

The citizens remained virtually
helpless since all phones were
tapped and only security persons
were permitted to handle firearms.

“The army refused to fire on the
Romanian people because they
are the Romanian people,” said
Gheorghiu. 0

As far as Romanian life since the
executions has been going, it
appears celebratory. “Everyone is
excited," said Gheorghiu.

The stores are now filled with
supplies, and full electricity has
been restored.

The students demonstrators still
remain a little afraid, with the future
of communism in Romania still
unknown.

Elections are now planned since
organized opposition never
occurred before. “It's far more of
a democracy than any other Eastern
bloc country," said Gheorghiu.

Gheorghiu and her family now
have plans to return to Romania —
but only for a visit.

“Once you've been in the United
States for so long it’s hard to go
back,” said Gheorghiu.

   

UNIVERSITY or PIT'I‘SURGH

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Going into this Sunday’s NFL
conference championship games,
two teams will be hoping the
third time really is the charm,
while another will be trying to
put itself in a position to adopt
the Pittsburgh Steelers’ aging
slogan “One for the Thumb.”

When the Cleveland Browns
(10-6-1) line up against the
Denver Broncos (12-5) in Den-
ver’s Mile High Stadium, it will be
the third time in four years that
the two teams will battle for the
AFC title. Both previous match-
ups -— in 1986 and 1987 — were
won by the Broncos in a rather
dramatic fashion, as “The Drive”
and “The Fumble” have taken
their place in NFL lore.

The two teams met once dur-
ing the regular season, with
Cleveland winning a game
marred with controversy, 16-13.

The Browns, championsiof the
AFC Central, are looking to give
head coach Bud Carson — as

, well as themselves — a first-ever '

trip to the Super Bowl. One thing
the players have learned, though,
is that the rocky road to it goes
through Denver.

“We have something to prove,”
said Cleveland defensive line-
man Carl “Big Daddy” Hairston.
“Both times we played [Denver]
before, we played well enough
to win, but the breaks went their
way. We owethem.”

Head coach Dan Reeves’

Broncos, meanwhile, are hoping
to gain one more shot at the
Vince Lombardi Trophy in the
1980s, as well as another shot at
league credibility. Denver has
been blown out twice by NFC
teams in recent years: 39-20
against the New York Giants in
1986 and 42-10 vs. Washington a

year later. Overall, the Broncos -

are 0-3 in Super Bowl play.

Denver bounced back from a
mediocre 8-8 campaign in 1988
and landed in this season’s con-
ference championship game.

“Last year was so unbelievably
frustrating for all of us,” said
Reeves. “That makes our success
this year all the more sweet 
Cleveland is going to be tough.
They’re on a mission.”

Reeves was named the Associ-
ated Press AFC Coach of the Year
for his efforts in restructuring his

team, whichfinished 11-5” this.

season.

Over in the NFC, the San Fran-
cisco 49ersi(15-2) are the favorite
to capture their fourth Super Bowl
trophy -— a feat so far performed
only by the Pittsburgh Steelers in
the 1970s. .

seventh NFC West title of the
decade, will meet the wild-card

However, the Rams were one
of only two teams to defeat San
Francisco in 1989. The other was

Los Angeles, a squad that pos-

playing its best football of the

two of the last three meetings

Pitt swim teams hope to make a big splash a Penn State
Lady Panthers sboot 9 C

II» for two in a row...

By Jim Lakely
Staff Writer

Anytime Pitt and Penn State clash, it is a big

 

event, and Saturday’s women’s swim meet is no
exception. Penn State, currently tied for third in
Eastern rankings with Pitt, is hosting this televised
meet. _

Along with the home-pool advantage, it is also
Parents Day in Happy Valley. Penn State has a very
strong team and is in top swimming form this year.
With all of this in Penn State’s corner they have
their eyes on handing Pitt its second defeat.

“The overall talent of both teams is very close,”
said Coach David Belowich. So close in fact,
Belowich has predicted a 150-150 tie. “We have to
be able to get up and race. We haven’t raced since

. Dec. 2, and Penn State has already had a meet, so

they have a definite advantage,” said Belowich.

Pitt feels much more comfortable at home, and
the festival-like atmosphere created by Penn State
this weekend could be the deciding factor. Penn
State will be up for the challenge, and you can bet
Pitt will be too.

Junior Celeste Makiel, a four—time Big East
champion relay swimmer, anticipates a great meet.

“Penn State is very tough,” she said. “I expect it
to be real competitive.”

Makiel had the ﬂu over Christmas break, and
although individually she doesn’t feel very confi-
dent for Saturday’s meet, she will give it all she has.

The team is now looking toward the Big East and

The Pitt men’s swimming team will be traveling to Penn
State this weekend in hopes of avenging one of its only two
losses last season. ’

“We should beat them,” said senior captain Mike Kozlina.
He believes both teams are evenly matched but said that the
Panthers’ confidence may prove to be a determining factor.

The meet will be televised in the Penn State area, and a
large crowd is expected to be rooting against Penn State’s
historic interstate rival.

“The team is very excited,” Panther sophomore Dave
Schepner said. “I’m very optimistic about the rest of the

season.” ~

The Panthers tuned up for their 1990 schedule by compet-
ing in relays over Christmas vacation in Boca Raton, Fla.
After dropping the first race they went on to win the
remaining seven events against Ohio State, Dartmouth and
Toledo. ‘

The Panthers currently have a 3-1 record with first-place
finishes in both the Pitt Invitational and the Christmas Meet.

After Penn State, Pitt will host West Virginia and Villanova,
followed by the Big East Swimming and Diving Champion-
ships, Eastern Seaboards and the NCAA Championships.

Kozlina said he is confident that Pitt will win the Big East.
He and Schepner are both anticipating an improvement of
their fourth-place finish at last year's Eastern Seaboards.

Ladies   track team goes north

By Brandy Simms .
For The Pitt News

The Lady Panther indoor track
team travels to the “Great White
North” on Saturday to compete in
the Windsor Invitational in On-
tario.

In order to win the Windsor
meet, Pitt women's track coach
Steve Lewis feels that a team
effort will be necessary. “We

want to establish ourselves in
certain areas,” said Lewis.

Lewis has high expectations
for this year's ‘team and with
good reason. Last season the Lady
Panthers came away with their
first-ever Big East Indoor Track
Championship, and Lewis said
he believes they can repeat that
performance. He also wants them
to score more team points in the

national championship than ever

ill WAR OF lllf ROSES

By Scot Ross

Managing Editor

Milton Berle made a career
simply out of borrowing other
comedians’ jokes. Garry Trudeau

' makes a living satirizing the
, exploits of others. '20th Century

Fox has combined both tactics
for its new darkened comedy
The W/arof773eRoses, and adding
a few alterations to the premise
of embittered spouses dividing
their personal assets, the movie

pokes a gnarled finger at the
“that's mine, this is yours”"wor1d
of wealthy, suburban divorce.
In his histories, Shakespeare
chronicled The War of 7799 Roses,
the struggle between the houses
of York and Lancaster for the
power of Anjou. Danny DeVito is
the storyteller of this tale, acting
as director as well as divorce
lawyer Gavin D’Amato, the

story of Oliver and Barbara Rose

the use of D’Amato’s services.

The saga of the couple is
explored from their first meeting
at an auction, through marriage
and the birth of their two children,
and to the night Barbara
announces to a shocked Oliver
that thoughts of his premature
death filled her with a sense of’
relief. _

In the presence of an attorney,
the two quickly pass over custody
of their children and clash on
custody of a more important
commodity: the spacious house.
Barbara asserts that she spent the
previous 20 years working and

Showcase selections: the de in films ,

I By Dmitri Ragano

Asst. Showcase Editor

There were a lot of excellent
'80s. Somehow,
despite the fact that movie-making
became a business like never
before, many independent artists
thrived. The foreign scene
produced its fair share of wonders.
Film acting was better than ever
before (with the undisputed Actor
of the Decade sitting in the White
House).

All criticism is subjective, and
I’ll say right off I prefer films that
take a chance and try to do

something different. These films

are often marginal, often seen by
few people, often the kinds of
films that stir strong reactions in
people. (You either love ‘em or
you hate ‘em.)

. In terms of earnings and appeal,
the decade in movies belongs to
Spielberg. In terms of art, I think
it belongs to other people.

Here are 10 films that, as one
critic put it, “made a difference in
the ’80s.”

Blue Velvet. (1986) A: college
boy finds a hallucinogenic hell
hidden behind his hometown’s
white picket fences. David Lynch
(Eraserbead, Elephant Man) is

probably the only director whose
stories rely on his images instead
of the other way around. You
love it or you hate it, but there's
nothing else like it.

Melvin and Howard. (1980)
Jonathan Demme’s indie
breakthrough is based on the
story of Melvin Dummar, a blue-
collar oddball who claimed to
have picked up Howard Hughes
in the Nevada desert and to be

I heir to his fortune. Following

Melvin through his trailer-park
existence, his job as a milkman,
his broken marriage and dreams
of game-show riches, Demme is

interested in the America that
Hollywood forgot, coming up
with a goofy/heartbreaking
working-class fable.

Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
(1982) Surfers, preppies and nerds
adrift in the land of malls, bad sex
and Led Zeppelin IV. This was
the first and best of the hordes of
teen ﬁlms that invaded our
nation’s theaters like swarming
locusts in the mid-'80s. Superb
acting from Jennifer Jason Leigh,
Sean Penn, Forest Whitaker and
Judge Reinhold. Written and
directed by Cameron Crowe.

Matador. (1986 — but didn’t
come to Pittsburgh ‘til this month)
More shocking and interesting

than A Clockwork Orange, this
taboo—breaking Spanish import
is probably the most excessive
ﬁlm of the decade and one of the
most entertaining. A womanizin g
ex—matador kills his lovers, and

elegance, while Oliver contends
his long hours at the law ofﬁce
gave her the ﬁnances to do so.
Neither is willing to compromise.

Through a little-known
precedent, Gavin informs then-
client and friend Oliver he has as
much right to stay in the prized
home as Barbara. The tension
between the two builds, and rising
conﬂicts foreshadow the eventual
Hotspur-Prince Hal ﬁght to the
death.

All the while, Gavin adds his
own insight, and DeVito adds
directorial touches, spooﬁng the
great directors’ methods of
creating tension and suspense.
His use of lower and personal
perspective is reminiscent of
Orson Welles’ shots in Citizen
Kane, although instead of Charles
Foster Kane walking through a
sea of New York Inquirers
announcing his defeat for
governor, it’s Oliver Rose getting
punched down a ﬂight of steps or
Barbara Rose ’s repulse as he gulps

camera.

Alfred Hitchcock tendencies
are also apparent as DeVito
employs the late, overweight
creator’s use of food as a mirror
to the flaws of people in the
dinner scene. Oliver forcing
bite after bite into his mouth is
visually revolting, and Barbara
later admits that the sight
brought her near to fisticuffs
with her husband. ~

Another interesting
technique utilized in the ﬁlm
is the use of exaggerated
physical stunts, from Oliver
escaping unhurt after crashing
from the attic onto a table, to
Barbara avoiding a long spill
from the staircase by making a
gymnastic leap onto the huge
chandelier. DeVito’s other ﬁlm,
Throw Momma From The
Train, included scenes like
this that allowed the audience
to laugh at accidents ‘ that
otherwise would cause
debilitating injuries. This
manipulation of physics further

the ridiculousness involved in
dividing marital assets.

These devices are pulled across
successfully; however, DeVito as a
concerned friend/storyteller is a bit
contrived. Gavin comes across as an
unscrupulous character when
interacting with Oliver and Barbara,
and months later he is this
sympathetic, pro—marriage, almost
infallible saint.

Otherwise the story is nearly
ﬂawless. The dialogue allows its
speakers to tell their story through
their use of language. Throughout
the divorce proceedings, Oliver
questions Barbara about her motives
like the conniving barrister he is.
Barbara’s rhetoric is equal to her
character. Responding to Oliver’s
interrogation, Turner’s calculating
blond coolly informs Oliver of his

shortcomings that have merited her .

notions of divorce.
Its sharp edge is the entertainment
of the ﬁlm, and although it owes

some of its crisp look to techniques

of the past, the ﬁlm deserves credit
for having the guts to present the
sacred institutionof marriage in terms
of a prizeﬁght, the winner being
decided by points scored in the ring.
And unlike the Doug1as—Turner
Romancing the Stone tales, the
audience finds itself resisting the
urge for the pair to rediscover love
and shout no mas to the ringside
referee.

 Faith N o More: ‘As the Worm Turns’

By Tim Azinger
Showcase Editor

Faith No More surfaced in 1982
and pounded out what was, at
the time, an innovative style

gi combining early punk inﬂuences
with up—and—coming rap and
metal, and just enough social
‘consciousness to ward off any
anarchistic comparisons. (It was
this same musical style that
eventually brought success for
The Red Hot Chili Peppers.)
Bill Gould, bassist for Faith No
More, had just been awakened
by the ringing of the phone. “It’s
my last day of freedom,” he said,
“so I wanted to relax as much' as
possible.” In a few short hours,
