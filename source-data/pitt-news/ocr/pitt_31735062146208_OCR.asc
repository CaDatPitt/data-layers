resentative of the _‘ Detroit’ “Free

class of 1894 hold a 'reunion around

exactly .25 years. since they left col-
lege. «He has already writtento some

favorable to it. .

His idea would be to have a special
class reunion and ‘dinner of the old
college and engineering crowd who
attended W-. U. P, on the Perrysville

been together, to his knowledge, since
they graduated, and he believes, un-

turn." ‘?Bob”_Brown and Frank Smith
are the only ones‘ whoare locatedany,

Mr. Duff says he feels sure they, could
be cajoled. into coming. -

The Secretary‘is getting in touch

basket ball team, the Varsity ﬁve will
Dlay a post-season game, -Monday even-
ing. April 7, at 8 -o’clock, at.Trees
Gymnasium, with the all-fraternity
team. whose selection ap.peared in the
last issue of the Pitt Weekly. The
scheduling of this game with the Var-
sity has resulted rfrom the. favorable
comments heard on the campus re-
garding the lineup of the all-fraternity
team, and the desire of the students
in/general to see them contend against
the Varsity. The proceeds "of this
game will be given over to the Salva-
tion Army. The admission will be 35
cents. , '

The all-fraternity team has begun

‘practice and judging from the form

shown during these sessions the Var-
sity will have a formidable opponent.
An interesting and lively game is as-
gsured byboth teams. '

Harry Levine, captain of the «Var-
sity, has called out the members of
the team for practice in anticipation
of a hard contest. The all- 'aternity
team will appear on the floor with a
galaxy of stars whose ability in this
line of athletics has been commented
on by followers of the indoor sport at
Pitt. - .
