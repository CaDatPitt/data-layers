UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Condemnation of Israel

By ROBERT ZAVOS

 Defeated at WPDU, Debate

«

_ The William Pitt Debate Union’s recent parliamentary debate on the topic “Resolved:
that this House condemns the establishment of the State of Israel” brought strong emo-
tional responses from both sides. When the debate was over, perhaps a few members of

the audience were slightly Wiser because of the experience.

Speaking before a standing room audience, Mahmood Mamdani, senior politica
science major, opened the case for the “Government” (deven-ding the resolution) by say-
ing, “the establishment of the state of Israel was due to an alliance of Zionist colonialism and British

imperialism.”

He cited figures to show that the‘Zionist had artiﬁcially built up the Jewish population of Pal-

estine before the establishment
of the Jewish state on May 18,
1945. He remarked, “in_ 1880 the
Jewish population of Palestine
was a mere three per cent . . .
and by 19l_7 had only increased
to 17 per cent.” He remarked
that there were several incidences
‘of Jewish aggression against the
Arabs who were then living in
Palestine, but were pushed out
in order to form the Jewish state.
Steve Leightman, political sci-
ence senior, began the case for

the “Opposition” with the ass'er- 1

tion that Mamdani was “consis-
tantly wrong in his speech.” He
explained, “Zionism was started
in 1880 to combat the terrorism
in the Soviet Union started by
the Cossacks.” He continued, “this
was not a coalition between the
British and Jews, and in fact, the
British ‘white paper’ limited im-
migration in the Jewish state be-
fore its establishment.”
Leightman brought out the fact
that the United Nations Special
Committee on Palestine recom-
mended the creation of the Jew-
ish state, and the General Assem-
bly voted on and carried the res-
olution by the required two-thirds
majority. He no-ted, “eight hours
after Israel proclaimed her inde-
pendence the Arabs attacked.”
The second speaker for the

“Government” was Armand Bel-A

ly, junior political science major,
who proclaimed that the Jews
had no right to push out the
Arabs. He stated, “What was
done to the Jews in Europe does
not give the Jews the right to
do the same to others.” Belly
continued, “my ancestors were
also thrown out of eastern Eur-
ope, but I do not support the
establishment of Israel.” _
He added, “The establishment of
a Jewish state is nothing but seg-
regation. It is equivalent to say-
ing that Jews cannot live among

other peoples.” He tried to con-

tinue, “I see many of my Jewish
friends . L .” but he was interrupt-

ed by Leightman who quipped,_

“not any more.”

Throughout his speech several
members in the back of the pack-
ed room had comments to make.

At one point Dr. Robert New-‘

man, Speaker of the House, inter-
posed and asked that they save
their comments for the end when
members of the audience could
give short speeches.

junior in political science, who

Student Government ,-
Reacts to Measure On    l
Out — of - State Tuition 

By DAN BOOKER

V (See Edz'tor£a.l—Pa.ge Fowr)

A bill, demanding a removal of the out-of-state fee and *5‘?

a reduction in tuition for out-of-state students failed to get .
through the Senate as Student "Government (SG) held itsﬁjf
ﬁrst fall term meeting Tuesday. The measure was not voted
‘down by the senators but was withdrawn after certain ﬂaws

in the bill were revealed.

The proposal, introduced by Senator Ron Colwell, stated that ‘
SG should urge “Acting Chancellor Kurtzman, Governor Scranton, I
and the Pennsylvania state legislature” to take action that would :11
relieve part of the ﬁnancial burden on out-of-state students. Vice-’ "3
president Howard Ainisman pointed out that the best way to get‘
action is through the chancelor and that approaching the governor
and egisature would mean nothing. v V

A special committee has been formed to look into problems of 
out-of-state students and perhaps present a new bill to the Senate. ‘
Senators Jon Meyers, Abe Singer, and Cowell will serve on the com’-..

mittee.

The Senate alsopheard a report ﬁ'om Terry Hyman, chairman of
the Constitution Committee. Hyman announced that student referen-
dum o-n the proposed SG constitution will be conducted October 18

and 19. Booths will be set up in
the Commons Room, SU‘, Towers
lobby, and probably in Engineer-
ing and Scaife Halls.

Part-time, full-tirne and- grad-

uate students will vote in the
election. Hyman emphasized the
need for strong student support
if the constitution is to be im-
plemented. '
I In further . business, SG ap-
proved changes in the rules for
allocation of funds from the stu-
dent activity fee. All applica-
tions must now be turned in
within two weeks after they are
available. The previous deadline
was three weeks. Also, organi-
zations can apply for funds to be
used for one trimester. Applica-
tions before could be made" for
one month into a second trimes-
ter.

SG President Ralph Manning '

opened the meeting by commend-
ing the Senators for “a good job

in the past.” But he also urged
greater student involvement and.

a redoubling of effort this year.
He suggested that SG might look
into areas of the University to
see where improvement is need-
ed and then fulﬁll these needs.
Areas he‘ mentioned were the
Health Service, the Book Store,
and cafeteria food.

Ainisman suggested that,
through regular meetings with
the chancellor,» student leaders
pressure for a greater student

AWS Traditions Test Helps

Women Greet Lantern Night

By BETH LAZERICK

The women of the Class of
’70 approach Lantern Night,
their official entrance into
the University community,
better -prepared than the
past two classes for the re-
sponsibilities they Will assume.
Since last Wednesday, freshmen
women have been taking Asso-
ciated Women Students’ (AWS)
Traditions Test which asks for a
basic knowledge of University
traditions.

Peggy Jo Timko, Vice-president
of AWS, told this year’s Mentors,
who will be administering the

test, that the Tradition Test is
not to be considered a competi-
tive exam. Rather, the freshmen
should view it only as an incen-
tive to become better members
of the University community.
The test, which will be given
through next Tuesday will be
checked for a minimum know-
ledge of the required information

All of the questions are taken ‘

from the materials in the “Pitt
Co-ed,” an AWS publication that
every new woman student re-
ceives.

Knowledge of such things as
the “Legend of the Spoon,” the
words to the “Ahna Mater,” the
University Grace, and the presi-

dents of Student Government and
AWS are items contained in the
“Pitt Co-ed” and therefore, pos-
sibilities for the test.

Emilie Zielinski, Traditions
chairman of AWS, prepared the
tests and will assist the Mentors
in administering them.

Condemnation of Israel I

Defeated at WPDU Debate

(Continued from Page 1.),

—-spoke againstthe “Government,”
seevral of the hecklers arose to
give short comments. Unfortu-
nately, some were less witty in
’frOnt of the house than when
‘hidiné in the back.

The .ﬁrst impromptu speaker
asserted that “both sides had not
even read the topic.” He remark-
ed, “The topic _is the establish-
ment of the State of Israel, not

the prior history.” A second

speaker for the “Government”
cited an article by a Jewish ﬁg-
urehead which condemned the
establishment of Israel. The ﬁnal

impromptu speech was delivered .

by a balding,’ middle—aged gen-
tleman who wandered in to ex-
press his views. Time was called
after four minutes, and he re-
linquished his position to give the
house the ﬁnal say.

The resolution was defeated
by a rough count of 64 to 50.

WITH ONE blow, the leg-

By making the cost of at-

 The bill, which was eventaully withdrawn, was to be a resolution

In reality, only the Board of Trustees can make tuition changes. Any re-

Secon ily, the resolution offered no logical solution to the out-of-state
tuition problem. They requested that the out-of-statéfee ‘be removed as
a possible ﬁrst step. Such a suggestion ignored the fact that the Univer-
sity is not now receiving any more money that could compensate for such

Senators,Learn   The Facts 

Anyone who explored the situation would quickly. learn that a
reasonable ﬁrst step would be the removal of laboratory fees for out-of-
state students.

The out-of-state tuition question is perhaps the most pressing prob-

lem the University now faces. If the out-of-state tuition is not reduced,

then the likelihood of students from across the nations being attracted to
the University lessens. To maintain a cosmopolitan student body the Uni-
versity must either give manifold scholarship grants (which is unlikely)
or reduce the tuition.
It is the duty of Student Government to work for this reduction. But
the Senators will quickly fall ﬁat on their faces in this effort if they pre-
sent the administration with resolutions that demonstrate a lack of know-
ledge concerning the subject of the proposals. These bills will face the
scrutinization of men who are experts in university ﬁnances. .
You cannot expect the Chancellor or the Chairman of the Board to
support ideas which immediately strike them as irrational and superﬁcial.
We can only hope that the new Student Government committee appointed

to deal with this issue will learn the facts before they take their next step.

would drive the PAT out of
business.

It is obvious that the state
legislature and the adminis-
tration of the University
have written ofl’ out-of-state
students as of secondary im-
portance. A 4-to-1 tuition ra-
tio is not exactly attractive
to one not fortunate enough
to live in Pennsylvania. In
fact, it is absolutely repug-
nant. What rankles even

more, however, is the unbe.- -

lievably preposterious addli-
tion of a $100 _out-of-state fee,
as if a $1,200 premium were
not enough.

If the University is sin-
cerely interested in her out-
of-state students, then the
insulting out- of - state ‘fee
should have been without
question abolished, since it

is a University fee and easi-.

ly erased.

IF ‘THE. state was sincere-
ly interested in maintaining
Pitt’s cosmopolitanism, then
a suitable arrangement
should have been worked out
this summer. That this was-
not done,.that the emphasis
was placed on Pennsylvania
residents ﬁrst, -clearly indi-
cates just what the interests
of the legislature are.

As the situation now
stands, out-of-state students

. should feel abused and alien-

ated, the same’ way commu-
ters used to feel. As for this

out-of-state student, any fu- _ V
ture requests for alumni ﬁ- e

nancial support will be sum-
marily laughed at.

from being synonmous with
state university,” and that
“Pitt is still predominately

, private.”

Kurtzman’s assertions di-,
rectly contradict those of"
Carnegie President H. Guy-
ford Stever. While both

- agreed Carnegie and Pitt can

be mutually compatible, Stev-
er said, ,“Carnegie Universi-
ty will become the outstand-

Pitt the outstanding public

rent detachment from real-

Oitofluuion’

A vate personality

   

By Bill Cabin

ity. Dr.‘ Kurtzman
that inﬂuential Pittsburgh-
ers must continue to support
the private personality of
Pitt. Unfortunately, the
Pittsburgh inﬂuentials’ per-
ception is similar to Dr. Stev-
er’s. They do not see a pri-
in Pitt’s
character. To them it is part
of the state’s educational
system and totally public.
Dr. Kurtzman’s state-re-
lated appeals not only have
little appeal of community
leaders, but undermine pub-
lic support.‘ If the Acting
Chancellor, publicly asserts
it is not public, Pennsylvania
citizens cannot feel akin tof
Pitt’s public personality.
Dr. Kurtzman not only
denies the current reality,
but the reality which created
the schizophrenic Pitt. Pitt
was forced into state affili-
ation by ﬁnancial necessity.
Pennsylvania’s state legisla-
ture deliberated for nearly
one year before tossing Pitt
out of the political ﬁres into
the state-releated pit. Pitt
emereged as a toy of the
politicians and an undeniable
image as a state institution.
It is time Dr. Kurtzman rec-
recognizes this fact instead
of acting on ineffective. prem-
ises. His current policy suc-
ceeds only. in alienating all
the necessary elements of
support. The private sector
will not support Pitt because
it is public. The public can-
not support Pitt because it.
is “predominantly private.”
Out- of —staters disdain its
prejudicial tuition rates and
Pennsylvania students sit in
confusion.

Another  
  Beginning or End S
  Of Season Saturday?

 P 7 By Tom Sacks
b Sports Editor '

. ‘As far as those certain intangibles go, tomorrow could
‘be the beginning or the end of this year’s Panther football
-season ‘ C T
_ , ‘After having suffered through a horrifying season last
_ year,.the football players were shocked and depressed with
. their inability to stop UCLA last week.

Drugged by West Virginia, Syracuse and Notre Dame
last year, those who follow the Panthers
might have been saying, “Gee, 57 points.
 Another normal Pitt game.” But in ‘actual-
(* ity a 57-14 score between two big time foot-
 ball schools is a freak.

UCLA has one of the top teams in the
country this year, but it isn’t as good as
the score of last week’s game might indi-
cate. "And ‘Pitt won’t be tearing apart its
_ .\ A opposition. That’s for sure. But the capacity
 to play a good game is still there and tomorrow it will have
-I to be there.

The fault for last Saturday's Chiller Theater rests with
the defense. They were supposed to keep the game close.
::-Instead they couldn’t even get close to the Uclan ball car-
. .,riers.

 “The defense was holding back last week,” says Hart.

“They were afraid to make a mistake. This is good but be-
;i) cause of it they lost their aggressiveness. Hell, we didn’t
_.jump offsides once. That shows they weren’t aggressive.
I’ve been searching the game ﬁlms for a blitz and I’ve yet
1’ to see one.”

V .. Hart feels that one of the reasons the defensive unit

‘ had such a tough time was because there were too many
plays to learn and digest. There were 20 defenses, in all,
 planned against the Bruins. This week in practice the num-
 was cut down to eight for Duke.

 As Hart describes it, “The defense just seemed awed
 by the likes of Beban and Farr. I thought they were pre-
‘C pared, but I guess they weren’t.

._ Hart claimed he let up during practice the ﬁnal days
 before the opener. He feels it was a mistake. “We weren't
hitting all that week and we didn’t hit in the game.”

 ting hard.

“We’ve been hitting like trucks,”. said Tippy Pohl, de-
.. fensive cornerman. “We’re anxious to get out there and hit
»somebody else now. The way we’ve been practicing this
week, if we don’t win I’d hate to show up for practice Mon-
‘ (day. We all know we have to come back in this one.”

The offense jelled last week. It’s the defenses’ turn this
week. If Duke romps tomorrow, the effect on morale could
virtually put an end to the season after two games. If the
. defense stops the Blue Devils on their ﬁrst drive, Duke just
‘ might be in for an upset. It’s either then or never.

       

Well, they’ve been hitting this week in practice and hit- 7‘

By MIKE BROURMAN

The last time West Ches-
ter visited Kennard Field,

Craig Reynolds was instru-
mental in the Ram’s 1-0 victory
over coach Leo Bemis’ booters.
This year he is on the other side
of the fence. Tomorrow assistant
coach Craig Reynolds will be
rooting the booters home against
his former teammates.

Since Reynolds last saw action,
West Chester has added another
victory over the booters, making
them undefeated in six contests
against Bemis’ charges. Last
year's 4-1 victory by the Ram
was the only blot on the soccer
team’s regular season schedule.

It was Reynold’s goal in the
1963 game which gave West
Chester its victory. At the pres-
ent time," however, he is teach-
ing in the corrective program in
the Pittsburgh Public School Sys-
tem, and volunteered to help out
with the Hooters.

After observing them at close
hand, he believes. that they can
reverse their losing trend. “West
Chester plays a real pressure
game, but I believe that these
boys can handle them. They real-
ly seem conﬁdent.”

-Bemis feels that it was a lack
of conﬁdence which hurt the
team last year. “Last year the
boys were a little tight, a little
tense. They couldn’t do anything
right.”

If the Frostburg game is any
indication, this year things_ will
be different- Good play was in

Hart%Makes
Home Debut  
At Stadium

By GEORGE LIES

Football coach Dave Hart
makes, his home debut
against Duke University to-
morrow, but he may show
up with the old look and not
the new look which was in-
stalled BC (Before UCLA)- Game
time is 1:30 p.m. at the Stadium.

After seeing the new look
against UCLA last Week, Hart
decided to revert to the old
look which is simply the basics
of- football. The old _look com-
bines calisthenics, fundamentals,
and basic play patterns.

“We geared it wrong last week,”
“We Wanted to be
physically ﬁt. We were in num-
bers, but we weren’t as far as
playing condition goes.”

Hart also righted another of
last Week’s wrongs. “We didn’t
hit in practices last week,” he
said. “We let up. This week we

til two days prior to the game.”

Against Duke, the Panthers will
get their chance to act like hit-
ters. To stop talkback Jack De-
vonshire, who carried 19 times in
Duke’s conquest of West Virginia
for 80 yards, quarterback Al
Woodwall, who completed 11 of
16 pases for 135 yards, and full-
back Jay Calabrese, who gained
65 yards on 19 rushes, the de-
fense will have another good
chance to ﬁnd out if they can
defend.

“Duke has a poised experienced

supplemented by an inside run-
ning game,” said end coach Frank
Cignetti who scouted Duke last
week.

Four sophomores start, but
head coach Tom Harp can choose
from 32 lettermen. Junior Mike
Murphy, offense center, is the
one experienced blocker in the

' line while senior Bob Matheson;
co-captain, heads the linebackers.

For Hart’s switched around sec-
ondary Of Paul Killian, Joe Cur-
tin, Bobby Dyer, and Tjppy Pohl

( who returned to action early
this week), Dave Dunaway should"
prove interesting. Dunaway, a
senior end, caught seven passes
for 85 yards «against WVU. ‘

“He could be the best receiver
in the country,” said Cignetti.

For the second game of the
year, Hart plans to give the de-
fense only seven or eight pat-
terns instead of the 20 which
Hart learned was, “too, too many
against UCL .” “The players
Were awed by UCLA,” he said.
“They were afraid to make a mis-
take -Out there for fear of chatise-
ment by us (the coaches).”

On defense, only Greg Keller,
a right tackle, remains as a doubt-
ful starter. He bruised his should-
er in Monday’s practice,

At UCLA, the Panther offense
showed potential. Thirteen first
downs resulted from a total of-
fense of 319 yards. With 15 com-

pleted passes, quarterback Ed
James contributed 137 yards to
the total.

Besides James in the backﬁeld
Hart sticks with Mike Raklewicz
as the number one fullback. Dew-
ey Chester at tailback, and Skip
Orszulak at wingback.

Raklewicz also is listed at tail-
back behind Chester while Joe
Jones lines up as the number two
fullback. “Jones runs better all
the time,” Hart said. Although .
