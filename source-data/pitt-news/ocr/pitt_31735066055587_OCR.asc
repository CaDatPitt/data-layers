 Singer/songwriter Billy Joel captivated fans at Carnegie Music Hall on Thursday.

j stopping at college towns to answer questions
about himself, writing music and anything else in
the music business. And he also plays some of his

“I hope that this tour can sort of demythjfy the
‘ rock star image,” Joel said to a nearly sold-out
crowd at the Pitt Program Council sponsored

Joel’s 25-year solo career has taken him all
over the world, but his music has always reached

people asking vquestions ranged from 10 to 50.

And showing that generation gap, Joel played

Joel said he wrote the song after a business 1
associate of his had betrayed him. Eventually, 1
Joel sued the person, but he learned a valuable 

lesson about the music business.

“I finally got [the music business] when I 1

you’re thinking about your music —- not the

Piﬁ Police
arrest
suspected
drug dealer

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

A routine traffic stop for
Pitt Police officers Thursday
night resulted in the arrest of
an alleged drug dealer.

Javier Rodriguez, 26, was
arrested Thursday around 7
p.m. after Pitt Police officers
found cocaine, heroin and
$2,000 in small bills in his
car.

The officers saw
Rodriguez run through a stop
sign at Bouquet Street and
Clemente Drive near Forbes
Quad. According to Pitt
Police Chief Rick Boyd,
Rodriguez “took some eva-
sive action” to avoid the offi-
cers.

Rodriguez was headed off
by the officers near Joncaire
Street and Boundary Street
in South Oakland. The sus-
pect then got out of the car
“holding a bag containing
white powder,” Boyd said.

“Eight baggies of cocaine
and heroin and the money
were found in the car,” Boyd
said.

Rodriguez, from Highland
Avenue in Shadyside, was
charged with intent to deliv-
er both heroin and cocaine,
driving under the influence
of ‘a controlled substance and
fleeing and attempting to
elude police.

Vo/un feers share time,
laughs at Hand-in-Hand

For many students, exam day will no longer mean sharpening
number two pencils and filling. in hundreds of circles. They may
not even need to be on campus to take a big test, thanks to a
computer-assisted testing system recently introduced within the
University of Pittsburgh External Studies Program.

Pitt testing went cyber last summer when UESP began offer-'

“I had fun.”

It may not sound like much, but these three little words that Paul
Sanker uttered after the Hand-in-Hand Festival on Saturday meant
more than most people could imagine.

Sanker is a 12-year-old boy who suffers from Down’s Syndrome.
But at the Hand-in-Hand Festival, he seemed like any other 12-year-
old — running around and getting into everything.

ing two courses with a Computer-Assisted Testing System.
Students enrolled in these courses could take the exams via
computer at a designated on or off-campus site, but the number
of these was limited. Beginning this summer, UESP will offer
the CATS option for more than 20 courses, a few of which will
be from other schools within the university.

UESP will also create more CATS sites with the aid of a
$45,000 grant from Bell Atlantic. Robin Wingard, assistant dire-
tor of UESP, said the program wants to expand the availability
of CATS to more off-campus and regional areas. Planned sites
are Pitt-Johnstown, Pitt-Greensburg and rural areas such as
Kittaning, Uniontown and St. Mary's.

“This is just one more convenience for distance learners,” said

Admlssion is free“ When Sanker first arrived at Forbes Quad, he met his guide, sopho-
more Michael Sobieski. Right away you could tell that he would be
more than just a guide for the day: He would be Sar1ker’s new best
friend ’

The two carried on from the beginning, and pretty soon Sobieski had
become a part of Sanker’s world of make-believe. Boy. does this kid
have an imagination. He even had his new friend “marry” him to
another volunteer later in the day.

Once his mother left Sanker and Sobieski set out for their day of
fun. The ﬁrst thing that they did was go to hear the Pitt Pep Band play.

Before the band was done with its first song, Sanker was standing up
and acting like he was directing the band. He walked around waving

his arms like he was a professional
conductor.

Then he noticed the Pitt cheer-
leaders. Pretty soon, Sanker was
imitating them as well.

When the band was done, he
ran up onto the stage to see what
he could get into. He found a
friendly drummer who let him
play his drums. Sanker sounded
better than half of the drummers
of today’s most popular bands.

Next, Sanker wanted to go to
the cookie—decorating booth.
While he was there, he put icing
on his cookie and then tried to get
as many sprinkles as possible on
it Every time he bit into it, some
would fall off, so he would go
back and put on more sprinkles.

Sanker seemed to be the life of
the event No matter which booth
he went to, he eventually ended up
running the game for the other
children. At the “pop goes the
weasel” booth, he ended up
putting a weasel on his hand and
pushing it through holes for the
other kids to hit at. '

Sanker was even given a special

prize at the magician’s show at the
end of the event. He is now the
proud owner of a huge stuffed
dog. 1

Whether pretending to be mar-
ried and a father, or talking into
every microphone he went past,
Sanker seemed to have a great
day.

This was Sobieski’s second year
as a one—on-one volunteer. He
said, “I like becoming friends with
them  Paul latched on very
quickly, which made it a lot easi-
er.”

The hardest part, according to
Sobieski, isn’t running after the
kids, trying to make the day fun or
any other problem that might
come about. “Today is probably
the best day of the year for these
kids. The hardest part is the end of
the day when you have to leave
them.”

This was obviously true for
Sanker as well. He couldn’t quit
hugging Sobieski when his mom
came back to pick him up.

But Hand-in-Hand invovled
many Pitt students.

the three coordinators of this
year’s Hand-in-Hand Festival.

“Our goal is to bridge the gap
between the college community
and the handicapped community,”
she said ‘.‘We try to teach our vol-
unteers that the kids aren’t that
much different from us, and they
can teach us as much as we can
teach them.”

Bowman said that this year’s
festival had over 200 kids and at
least that many one-on-one volun-
teers. All in all, there were over
700 participants in this year’s
event. This includes all of the
clubs that donated their time to run
a booth or put on a show for the
kids.

Since Bowman is graduating
this year, this was her last. “It went
really smooth this year. It’s nice to
go out like this.”

Even though it took six months
of planning and preparation and
countless hours of hard work,
Bowman said she wouldn’t trade
this for anything in the world.

“You see how happy the kids
are, and that’s enough. It’s all

worth it. It’s very worth it”

Exam———

°From page 1
Wingard.

Since the UESP is designed
for non-traditional students
who do not regularly attend
classes, Wingard said that

’ CATS will allow them to

receive feedback an exam per-
formances without travelling
to campus to meet with a pro-
fessor.

CATS, which is pro-
grammed on Windows NT, is
uncrashable and user~friendly,
according to Wingard.
Students can move back and
forth throughout the exam
with ease and can view their
grade and professor’s com-
ments immediately after com-
pleting a test.

As with any exam, Wingard
said that cheating needs to be
prevented. “The rules that
have kept us ahead of the
game with pen—and-paper test-
ing apply here,” she said.

Wingard said that students
must receive ‘‘face—to-face

.. clearing” before taking an

exam by showing photo iden-

tification and proof of regis- .

tration. Each test site is proc-
tored and monitored by cam-
eras.

The first two CATS courses
received a good response from
students who used the pro-
gram, according to Wingard.
She said students were most
pleased with the quick grade
response.

Wingard said UESP plans to
keep adding courses to CATS.
Course material needs to be
conducive to CATS-type test-
ing, and approval of the pro-
fessor is required. “It’s going
to be a gradual process,” said
Wingard.

Syllabus packets for each
UESP course will indicate if it
has the'CATS option. For

Opinions  

Three cheers...not 21

If you have ever been in a college town (which, obviously, you
have) you probably know that if you aren’t 21, your entertainment
options are drastically limited. You can either catch up on the lat-
est reruns of “The Brady Bunch” or become intimate with that
book of Polish poetry you have been meaning to read. One thing
you may as well not bother doing, though, is leaving your house.

Here in golden-paved Oakland, the only thing you will find to
do after ll p.m. is go home. The Beehive closes; we don’t have an
Eat ‘n’ Park or a Denny’s; and 7-Eleven gets boring in about two
minutes.

We all saw what happens if you go to a bar when you’re under
21. Over 230 people got their driver’s licenses suspended or were
hit with fines because they didn’t want to sit in their dorm rooms
every night. Their only crime was that they had a drink with more
alcohol in it than NyQuil. The police who arrested the people at
Zelda’s shouldn’t be blamed; they were just doing their jobs.

The people we need to look to are the people in the legislature,
who, in their infinite wisdom, determined that only those of us 21
or older could have a drink. The 21-year-old minimum drinking
age has no purpose whatsoever other than to harass someone for
trying to have a good time. Under this law, as you may know if
you have ever tried to go to a bar, you can get in trouble just for
your presence in a bar. Even if you don’t look at an alcoholic bev-
erage, most places won’t even let you in the door.

When you are 18, you are, legally speaking, old enough to get
married, get a tattoo, get any part of your body pierced, leave
home to go to school (or just to get away from your parents),
smoke cigarettes or be drafted into the military. But you can’t have
a drink of wine to celebrate, or even a sip of beer for whatever rea-
son.

Whatever the rationale behind creating a minimum drinking age,
it doesn’t really work. In fact, a lot of people who drink under the
age of 21, specifically those who are freshly out from under their
parents’ roof, drink because they feel either rebellious or liberated
by drinking. But the law does not stop anyone from drinking
except the most conscientious, and you will be hard pressed to find
anyone who has never had a single sip of alcohol before turning
21.

Minimum drinking age laws do not prevent people from drink-
ing or from becoming alcoholics. Nor would the absence of a law
prevent people from getting drunk. People will always drink to
excess, no matter what the law says. As you may know, 18 to 20-
year-olds are not the only people who drink. If ‘the minimum age
limit were to be done away with (or at least lowered to 18), there
wouldn’t be a major drop in alcohol-related death or injury. What
there will be a decline in is the number of harmless underage
drinking offences that tie up the court system. V

Perhaps there should be some kind of minimum-maturity-level
requirement before you can drink. But the age requirement is noth-
ing more than an arbitrary number created to let the government
control more of our lives.

Immigration equals excess

The fact that America is a
nation of immigrants seems to
be a standard defense for the
nation’s current immigration
policy. To this I would reply that
we were also at one point a
nation of slave holders and seg-
regationists. However, when it
was determined that this was
not the correct course of action,
America changed. That is what
we must be willing to do today.
We must put aside emotion and
misplaced pride and look at
what is best for America and her
children.

There are two sides to the
immigration problem. One is
illegal immigration, which is
generally assumed to be detri-
mental. The other is legal immi-
gration, on which opinion is
much more divided. It is my
goal to show why both are prob-
lematic and how each could be
corrected. ,

While much effort is put into
combating illegal immigration,
little we have attempted seems
to have worked. While some
have argued that illegal immi-
gration fills bottom-level jobs
and keeps prices of such items
as produce low, Harvard econo-
mist George J. Borhas has cal-
culated that the net benefit to
American citizens is being
wiped out by the cost of the
immigrant’s welfare. He esti-
mated that welfare given to
immigrants is now over 20 per-
cent, twice the rate of native-
born whites.

This sort of argument is point-
less. I have discovered, while
watching people argue econom-
ics, that there are numbers that
strongly support every position.
An informed opponent of immi-
gration can bring up many facts
and figures that support his
position, while a supporter can
bring up many facts and ﬁgures
which show the exact opposite.
To use an analogy, economic
ﬁgures are to an activist as the
Bible is to a fanatic.

The plan which I will outline
attempts to combine the advan-
tages of illegal immigration

Jason
Curtis

while eliminating the disadvan-
tages. The first step is to repeal
the 14th amendment. The next
step is to add a new amendment
which is almost identical to the
14th but would read, “All per-
sons born to citizens or natural-
ized in the United States  are
citizens of the United States.”
This eliminates the problem of
non-citizens crossing the border
to have children which then
become our responsibility.

The next step is to allow guest
workers across the border to
work on farms. This allows the
American businesses to contin-
ue to reap the beneﬁts of lower
wages, while the workers can
take home some money to their
families. To those people who
say that these people are taking
jobs from American workers, 1
say, wake up. Ina land of wel-
fare, no Americans want those
jobs.

The final problem is how to
deal with people who cross the
border-illegally. Executions are
probably one of the ways to deal
effectively with this problem of
people who have little to lose,
but this concept would not only
be expensive, but it would also
have little support among liber-
als. My idea is to issue identifi-
cation cards to the guest work-
ers. This way employers could
determine whether their
employees were legal or not.
Any business caught with illegal
workers would be confiscated
and sold with the proceeds
going to the Border Control. If
the employers are too scared to
hire these people, the incentive
to cross the border will disap-
pear.

This leaves the problem of
legal immigration. Part of the
difficulty with legal immigrants
is not only their numbers, nearly
one million per year, but also
their higher-than-average
birthrate. According to a U.S.
Census Bureau study, the popu-
lation of the country will exceed

400 million by 2080 if current
levels go unchecked.
Immigration was a necessity for
America 200 years ago, but it
only serves to increase crowd-
ing in a country without any
more untamed frontiers.

Another problem is the
romanticized view of legal
immigrants as being either
geniuses, oppressed or able to
provide valuable new ideas to a
stagnant American culture.
There are two facts and an opin-
ion I would like to express in an
attempt to debunk these notions.
The first is that these foreign
geniuses amount to only a small
fraction of the total influx.
Perhaps by concentrating on
educating our own people rather
than sheltering parasites, we
would not even miss these peo-
ple. Speaking of parasites, the
second fact is that in Chinese-
speaking Asia, one widely dis-
tributed book tells potential
immigrants how to take full
advantage of the American wel-
fare state. Now for the opinion. I
feel that anyone who thinks that
the American people aren’t
capable of generating new and
exciting ideas has an extremely
pessimistic outlook. My experi-
ence is that when put in the right
situation (i.e. a small classroom
with a well—trained teacher),
American students are capable
of providing and producing a
great deal of insight and diversi-
ty of opinion.

In order to keep in touch with
our roots and still maintain
some flow of fresh ideas. I
believe legal immigration levels
should be set at around one mil-
lion per decade. This allows suf-
ficient room for political
refugees. truly oppressed
groups, etc. While I am chang-
ing the constitution, I might as
well change the Statue of
Liberty, too. How does this
sound? “Give us your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free  just
not so many of them!”

Gymnusis set new mark
Lady nth score W1 .95 on senior night

, Joy Drzewiecki
W. __ ff   For Pitt News

The Panther senior gymnasts gave Coach
Debbie Yohman something to remember them by
— a first—place, record—breaking score of 191.95
in their final home meet Saturday night against
IUP, Western Michigan and Temple.

Along with breaking their previous score of

190.575, the gymnasts also broke the team’s
records on the bars, on the floor and for the Best
 All-Around Gymnast.
Freshman Erika Flamer received the award
‘ for All-Around with a score of 38.725. Flamer
excelled in all four events, exceeding 9.525 in
each one. She took third place with her perfor-
mance on the vault (9.75).

While signing autographs from young,
- hopeful gymnasts, Flamer smiled and said, “I’m
V really happy. I’ve been working towards it all
7 season.”

Yohman said she was especially proud of
Flamer. “She started off on the lower score level,
but she pushed and pushed right to the top,” she
said. Placing her hands on Fl-amer’s shoulders,
Yohman looked at Flamer and said, “Erika, did
you ever think this would happen?” Flamer, still
smiling, could only say, “I can’t believe it.”

Brenda Stevens finished her last home meet
with a record—breaking score of 9.80 on the bars.
Stevens struggled in other events, though, with a
lower score than her usual on the beam and vault.

“Individually, I am disappointed with my
performance tonight, but the team as a whole did

. ry after the year 2000. Just in
case you’re new to these
parts, this is not a friendly
rivalry that just began a cou-
ple years ago. This series
dates back to 1893, with only
curdled blood separating the
two. ‘

Pitt Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes said he emphatically
tried to rekindle the home-
and—home series, which has
been on a four-year hiatus

since 1992, but each attempt

;f_; was met with a resounding

 “NO!”

8 ’ “Penn State has indicated

they do not want to continue

_ aihome-and-home series with
- us,” Jaynes said.

_ The key here is “home and

' home.” Instead of alternating

home’ games each year,
which is the basic format of
schedule making, Penn State
supposedly wanted Pitt to
visit Nauseous Valley more .
frequently than it came to
Pitt. -
Notonly is this unfair, it

makes no sense. But if you
read between the index and
ring fingers, it’s perfectly
logical.

' And that’s essentially what
Paterno is telling Pitt — to sit
and spin. Since Paterno has ’

powerhouse and has the

dove 1.8 points short of qual-
ifying for the final round and
the All-American one-meter
title.

Is diving Head Coach
Julian Krug worried?

“She isn’t diving as quickly
and sharply, but she has to
point to Senior Nationals,”
Krug said. “We have really
pointed towards one meet. If
it [the loss] has to happen, it
has to happen now.”

When a diver’s timing is
off, the results can be disas-

dive through sheer will, but
the best way is to let the
body's muscle memory take
each twist, pike and position
on its own. In the moment a
diver can think, “OK, pull in
now,” it can be too late, and
the dive will come up short.

Fresh off its first victory over St.
Bonaventure in Head Coach George
Dieffenbach’s 16-year tenure at Pitt,
the Lady Panther tennis team strug-
gled yesterday against the
University of Dayton.

Injuries and illness proved to be
too much for the Panthers, as they

’ were beaten 7-2 by the Flyers at the

Cost Center.

“It was a lot closer than that,”
Dieffenbach said. “We had some
players come real close, play real
tight matches.”

He was referring to Alison Baker
and Marla Zielinski who both lost
singles matches but, in the process,
extended their opponents to three
sets.

For Pitt, the two winning sets
came once in singles and once in
doubles. Erin Shalbrack, the
Panthers’ No. 2 seed won her sin-

gles match, andthe first-seeded
doubles combination of Marla
Zielinski and Fran Davis won their
match.

But it was not enough to slow
down the Flyers. They had too much
strength for the Panthers, and
Dieffenbach said the contest was
clinched after the singles matches,
in which Pitt was down 5-1.

Dieffenbach said the losing score
was partly, because two of his key
players were injured and two others

were sick. Jen Bible was nursing a
sore ankle, and Shalbrack had a bad
knee. In addition, Tamara Kalesnik
and Kristin Siegel had the flu.

“But the Dayton girls are tough,”
Dieffenbach said. “They are very
competitive.”

The loss drops Pitt’s overall
record to 7-7. Dieffenbach said he
hopes to have an injury-free and
healthy roster for the Panthers’ next
match-up against Youngstown State
tomorrow at the Cost Center.

 

The Panther tennis team struggled against Dayton yesterday with two key players nursing injuries and two having the flu.

Pitt’s Chris Perry

By Matt Townsend
Staﬁ Writer

He’s an intellectual, an individ-
ual and a scholar. He’s. a moun-
tain biker, a musician and an ath-
lete. He is senior swimmer Chris
Perry.

Chris Peny opposes the stereo-
type of the “dumb jock,” enjoy-
ing the pleasures of reading a
book at a local gathering place,
the hot debate of a controversial
social issue or the strumming of
his guitar.

There are two sides to him, one
of which is the intimidating com-
petitor that Coach Chuck Knoles
admits hewould not want to face

because of his “intense stare” and

“physical strength.”
And he also has a kind and

considerate side, of which team-
mate Tony Sunseri said, “He is
always willing to help anywhere
and in any way he" can.”

“Chris tries to be friends with
everyone. It doesn’t matter who
they are or where they came
from,” said teammate John
Haggerty.

Perry’s swimming career
began as a ﬁre-eyed six-year-old
playing Little League baseball.

“I was playing summer base— .

ball at the time, and I was really
horrible at that Then one of my
neighbors asked me to go out for
the local swim team, and I did,”
said Perry.

From then on Perry excelled in
the pool in his hometown of
Conestoga, Pa. At Penn Manor
High School, he was all-state two
years in a row, the Central Penn
League’s most valuable swimmer
and an All-American honorable
mention.

grew up in. The academics at Pitt were of
interest to him as well and have taken him to a
sociology major, with which he would like to
teach high school social studies after gradua-

tion this April. 1

Perry receives a par1ial scholarship and has
made the most out of it, making the dean’s list
six times with a 3.4 G.P.A.

. “I like to consider myself to be an academic
role-model,” said Perry. “I give up a lot, a
social life, but it’s made me a better person.
I’m more focused and have my priorities set.
I’m able to get my work done and manage my
time effectively.” _ '

An average day starts with a 5:45 a.m.
wake-up call and practice until 8:30 a.m.
Then he catches a quick nap ‘before a full day
of classes. After that, he hits the pool for
another practice from 3 to 5 p.m. After prac-
tice he either studies or goes to a night class
and then goes to bed around 10:30 p.m. On
the weekends, the practice schedule is lighter,
with Friday night and Saturday morning
workouts. He usually studies Saturday and
Sunday during the day and at night will go out

once in a while.

“I see myself as being more of an individual
on the team. I’m a team player, but I have my
own opinions, ways of thinking and my own
attitudes about things,” Perry said.
“Sometimes it conﬂicts with other team mem-
bers, and other times I get along real well. I
think it’s real important [that] you assert your
attitudes and ideas to the people around you to
let them know where you stand on things.”

When thinking about his individuality,
Knoles recalled the first time Chris came to
practice with a different hair color.

“His hair was green. At ﬁrst it was a little
bit of a shock, but since then we’ve gotten use
to it It’s been green, blue, yellow and white,”
Knoles said.

According to Knoles, Perry is always push-
ing the edge in fashion. He called him the
“Dennis Rodman” of swimming. Perry, how-
ever, is much easier to get along with. 9

“Chris is a unique asset to the team. He’s
really excelled in every area of college life.
He’s always willing to help anybody in any-

way he can, whether it be helping them with a

part of their stroke or consoling them after a

swim,” said Sunseri.

Haggerty added, “He’s always into practice.
He’ll always.._be enthusiastic about whatever
he is doing no ‘matter the situation, and that
picks people up.”

Since arriving at Pitt, Perry has improved

every year. He was the most improved swim-

mer of the 1993-94 season after he was the
Big East runner-up in the 200 breaststroke and
a ﬁfth-place ﬁnisher in the 200 IM.

At this year’s Big East, Perry placed third in
the 200 breaststroke with a time of 2:02.87
and placed eighth in the 200 I.M. (1253.15)
and also in the 100 butterﬂy with 50.40.

“Chris is a smart swimmer, very capable of
achieving any goal he wants to achieve. Most
of the time,.he sets his mind to achieving that

A goal and then achieves it,” said Knoles. “He

also has an emotional side at times, like the
end of the season when he allows his emo-
tions to take over. He can force himself into a
bad swim.

“As he has matured in the four years, he has
gotten much better at not doing that. He’s got-
ten better at staying a smart swimmer and rac-
ing smart.”

only Panther at the NCAA.

“We want to build a strong team,” said Krug. “Last year,
Sunday was here with Cara Sixbury. She had a roommate.”

Last year, it felt like a competition. This year,- she was com-
peting against divers she knew she could beat and knew she

would see again;

‘ In November, Lewandowski beat the three-meter first-place

finisher, Kansas’ Michelle Rojohn.

In April, the two will face off at Senior Nationals for the
opportunity to compete at June’s Olympic Trials.

Lewandowski’s other loss this season occurred at the Big
East. Yet she didn’t even have the opportunity to show she

could beat the two University of Miami divers who upset her
at that competition. They didn’t even qualify for NCAA.

The timing may not have been there for Lewandowski, but
she dove well enough to reach her ultimate goals.

“I feel like I’m building and building,” said Lewandowski.
“So when I get there, everything will kick in.”

Diving well at Senior Nationals has been the goal all year.

“I put together the best list possible,” said Lewandowski.
“Hopefully it will come together at Senior Nationals.”

ry. The reason why: money.

Although Jaynes didn’t
address the dollar issue, he did
mention that Penn State said it
wants to expand across the
country instead of being con-
fined to the East.

Is that why Penn State regu-
larly has Big East doormats
Temple and Rutgers on its
schedule — for home games?
Granted, Pitt isn’t much better
right now, but it appears that
Paterno is padding his sched-
ule with crearn-puff competi— ,
tion.

The reason why: money. He
knows that Temple and
Rutgers are starving for
national attention; therefore,
they would be more than
happy to visit Penn State more
times than they would be at
home.

The Pitt/PSU series will con-
tinue in 1997, which will be
the 93rd time that the two
teams have played. Penn State
leads the series 47-41-4. Until
1992, Pitt and PSU have
played 57 straight years, from
1957 until Penn State tem-
porarily put the in-state rivalry
on hold. They will continue to
play to 2000, but after that, it’s
history.

“I feel badly for the fans,”
Jaynes said. “I think it’s a
game that needs to be played.”

Jaynes is right. This is a
game that_needs to be played,
not only for the fans’ sake, but
also for the sake of college
football- It’s one of the longest
rivalries in football history.

So the next time Paterno vis-
its Pitt Stadium and starts ﬂex-
ing all his power, money and
All-Americans, we should be
ﬂexing as well.

Only we should be ﬂexing
our personalized eggs with a
middle finger intricately paint-
ed on the side. Then, and only
then, will he know the true
meaning of getting screwed.
