Another frabernityrushing season
is at hand, two weeks earlier than
the usual" custom and open to sec.-
ond semester freshmen‘ and” all up-
perclassmen, regardless of their aca-
demic standing.

The rush period. which opened
Monday morning and will continue
until midnight on September 24, is
the ﬁrst to be held‘ under the modi-
fied rushing rules as‘ adopted by In-
tei-fraternity council, _ last spring.
The most signiﬁcant change is the
clause which permits:any'upperclass-
men to pledge without regard’ to 
grades, but prohibits him from being
initiated into. the _organization- until
he has completed two ve credits with
twelve quality points in the semester
immediately preceding his initiation.

If the pledge fails to earn twelve
credits and twelve quality ‘points dur-
ing the first semester inwvhich he is.

mester he -shal1‘be'automatica‘lly di“s-“
pledge and shall‘ not again , become
eligible for pl-edgingyuntil he has
earned the necessary credits and
quality points. ‘

passed in the spring, e rules and

which is always to be considered in

other hand, the rushees, whether
they have sufficient quality points
or not will gain the advantage. of.
fraternity life, which may. give them’
the incentive to apply themselves
sufficiently to their school work,” de-
clared *A1-ens in a statement to the
Weekly.

Rushing events are being lanned
by the majority of fraternities and
a number of dances. and smokers

vestigation committee and intimated‘
that much stress would be laid on
the activities of. this committee.

“It is our duty,’.’ says Garver,

tinction ,and,freshmen_ are £11761’! the
privilege of wearing it. lot only
does it bring honor to the fresh-
man himself, but it also brings hon-
or to the University.‘

“We ask» that the Druids and up-
perclassmen co-operate in the en-
forcement‘ of the regulations to bet-
ter enable the freshmen. to create a
greater s irit, I friendship, and love
for our. A ma Mater.

“We hope to create a new fresh-
man spirit that will encourage and
serve as a betterment to our fresh-
men, upperclassmen, and last, but
not -least, our Alma Mater.”

committee to take the -names of re-

One. of the most startling jumps
since‘ the scholastic standing of
men's fraternities was placed on a
%ompetitive basis, was that made by

lace, honors went to Pi

twenty-first position to third place

by garnering a quality point aver-

age of 1.399. Theta Kappa. Nu, who
led for the first semester last’ year,
also. showed a marked advance by
ﬁnishing ﬁfth as compared with the
twentieth position aye-ar ago.
Fraternities who staged come-
backs‘ by jumping six or more
notches included Kappa Sigma from
ﬁfteenth to sixth; and Phi Epsilon
Phi, from nineteenth to seventh. De-
creases in rank are shown by Alpha
Phi Alpha, sixth‘ to thirteenth; and
Omega Psi ‘Phi, ninth to twenty-ﬁrst.
“The” startling increases and de-
creases in the ranking of several
fraternities, especially for those af-
fected by the new deferred rushing
rules of the past two years, indicate
the competitive spirit with which
pledges able to earn high grades
were sought, according to Theodore
Biddle, assistantto the dean of men.
Biddle also announced that a study
showing the general“ trend in
scholarship, of the men's social fra-
ternities represented at the Univer-
sity _ revealed a steady swing up-
ward, reaching a. high all-fraternity
average of 1.236 in 1929-30 as com-
pared ,with 1.205 for the previous

year. .
The averages of the fraternities

were computed by the registrar's of-

ﬁce and given official standing by
the office of the dean of men.

Although. the new; quality point
scale system, the method’by which
points arealloted to each grade, was
formally adopted  the University
Council last May, it has not yet been
definitely passed by». the deans, and
because of this will not be put into
effect this fall, acc“ording to a state-
ment from the§‘.0-ffrce of the regis-
trar. ;  _ _ 4

The new .system, which was
adopted by the University Council
upon receiving a favorable report
from a committee appointed to in-
vestigate the change, provided _for
an incr'easte;,13_i-the number of points
given toieach grade from “A” down
to “F." .  ' -

In accoiidance with the new plan,
the Iiumfber of points required for
graduation’ from undergraduate
schools ‘has also been revised. The
system now in use calls for 90 qual-
ity poi as a graduation require-
ment -tho new plan in the same pro-
portidn‘”"§‘speciﬁe‘s 450 quality points.
, The deans are expected to either
approve or reject ‘the pro-posed
change within the next few weeks.

Temple Site

Is Cleared

 

Laboratory Work In Moved

Buildings Continues

 

To make room for the new Temple
of Science being erected for the Mel-
lon Institute, a two-story structure,
now housing some of the chemistry
laboratories of the Institute, was
moved from its former location at
the corner of Dithridge street and
Fifth avenue to a site on the Cathe-
dral of Learning plot.

Despite the fact that it was neces-
sary to move the building several
hundred feet, work in the laborator-
ies was not interrupted. The moving
required slightly more than a.
month's time.

Work on excavating for the new

Temple of Science is expected to be
started during the early fall al-
though no deﬁnite time has yet been
set '

The new building will house seven

floors of laboratories, which arejtc
be grouped about interior courts,
with the central laboratory three
stories in hei ht, and provision made
for additions. stories later.

Greatly increased library facilities

Directors

will also be made available in the
new building and the already large
collection of scientiﬁc works pos-
sessed by the Institute will be great-
ly expanded. I .

clined to reveal the cost of the struc-
ture in order to avoid giving the

Open Lecture Courses

Without Class Work

Credit will be given College stu-
dents enrolling ‘in lecture courses

are required under a new plan an-
nounced .by Dean L. P. Sieg.

Students enrolled in these classes
will merely be required to attend two
or three lecture hours during the
week and will not be held responsi-

ments. Among such courses being
offered, are several in chemistry,
physics, political science and history.
The new plan will permit ‘those
students who are seeking a general
survey of the subject to obtain this
without sacriﬁcing work in their re-
quired subjects, explained Dean-
Sieg.

From the Cathedral of
Learning—— . -

Yes, an elevator takes passengers
to the 34th floor, now, but you have
to have an official pass before you
get taken for a ride—and you get
only one ride, too.

The passport system became
necessary when skylarking crowds
of visitors in the Pittscraper became
so numerous that . they impeded
workmen, of which, by the way,
there are about 200 employed at
present. I . '

The red neon aviation warning
beacon atop the Cathedral is half
burnt out; three of the six tubes are
dark. Like a star, it burns day and
night, but like a star you can’t see
it in the daytime.
~ A swarm of wasps (or are they
hornets) have a nest on the very tip-
top story of the structure. They
have a full view of Forbes Field,
home plate and all, virtually to
themselves. _

The Cathedral elevators r1se_ 700
feet a minute, 200 feet a minute
slower than those in the famous
Koppers Building downtown. It took
our elevator conductor 54 seconds to
get us from the 1st to the 34th ﬂoor.
From there to the top? On foot by
steps-——ﬁve ﬂights very narrow.

There are cute (?) little stone
balconies, just. room for two, hung
on each corner of the 29th story.
If Juliet had stood there, Romeo
must needs have shouted his love
from the house-tops, 375 feet be-
low.

It is reported that the stadium au-
thorities found even more ‘unusual
colors for the tickets. After using all
the better known colors in the spec-
trum, they have, degenerated into
using the more subtle shades, such
as pink and lilac. We suggest that
the name of the color on the paste-
boards be printed in large bold type
on the back, for the beneﬁt of the

Looking Them Over

  with the

CAMPUS SCOUT

Within ten more days, the majority of college football
teams willinaugurate their season. Some teams will start their
season this week-end, while a few others will wait until the
first Saturday in October to commence activities.

Due to the loss of ﬁve veterans, all of whom were picked
on one or more of‘ last winter's All-American teams, most Pitt
folllowers express grave doubts as to the ability of this year’s
team to in e as good a showing as did last year’s aggregation.

Personally, your ‘scout does not think that the loss of the
afore-mentioned stars will affect Pitt’s hopes for a great record
as much aswill the difficult schedule which W. Don Harrison,
director of athletics, has arranged for the Panther gridders.» -

The schedule includes nine games, seven of which are with

I major college teams. This list includes Notre Dame, last year’s

national champions who will be met here on October 25 in Pitt’s
“Homecoming" day; Nebraska, 1929 champions of the “Big

Six"; Carnegie Tech, which this year looks forward to a team ,0

the equal of their 1928 aggregation; Syracuse, whom the
Panthers have beaten only three times in ‘seven games since
1918; West Virginia, which annually gives the Panthers a hard
battle; Ohio State, the only team which outscored Jock Suth-
erland’s boys last season in the matter of first downs, and Penn
State, which boasts of two of the best running backs in the
country in Diedrich and French, a brother of the former Ath-
letics' baseball star.

To add, to the difficulties of the Pitt standard-bearers, only
three of these games will be played at the stadium, those with
Penn State, Notre Dame and Carnecrie Tech. If the Panthers
can come through such a tough schedule with one or two losses,
they will deserve all the credit that canvbe heaped upon them.

I! 33 #

MATERIAL PLENTIFUL

Jock Sutherland has a great supply of talent on hand to use through.
the rigorous schedule. Despite the loss of Joe Donchess. All-American
endfor three years, the ends this year will be well fortiﬁed with Rip
Collins and Eddie I-Iirshberg, lettermen; Jim McMurdo, a re lar tack].-
last year, who may be switched to end this season; Ted Dai y and Isa-
dore Cohen, sophomores and Ed Schultz and Joe Tommins, reserves of
last season.

Reports from Camp Hamilton where the Panthers are in training
seem to indicate that Collins is displaying the same form which he showed
at the Ohio State game last fall when e outplayed both Wesley Fesler
and Donchess, the two outstanding ends of the country. Hirshberg has
reported in better condition than he did last year and the coaches are
conﬁdent that Eddie will havea great season. Should both these boy‘:
come through, McM.urdo will likel be shifted back to his old tackle berth.

» At the tackles, Sutherland as Tully,. a regular in his sophomore
year; Jess Quatse, regarded as the strongman of
collegiate football; McMurdo, in case the latter play-
er is not needed to ﬁll in an end berth; Walter Babic,
who saw. much action last year as a sophomore;
Charles Miller, who starred or the freshman tean
last-v..'year;~r "Fats" Walton, former W. P. I. A. L.
tackle at Beaver Falls high, and Al Ciper, who was
a reserve tackle last year. Al Corson, a reserve last /
year, is the only tackle to have graduated, making
the tPanthers.unusually well fortiﬁed in this depart»-
men

The guard positions which were defended last
year. by DiMeolo and Montgomery, two All-Ameri--
cans, are the only places where the Panthers will not
be as strong as they were last season. Hart Mor-
ris, the only returning letterman at this post, seems
to haveone of the- berths clinched. Morris last year
was considered by many critics to be the equal of
DiMeolo, but he was handicapped in his ﬁght to win

a regular berth by a leg injury which he received in training camp. The
leg has since mended and the Bellaire boy feels sure of enjoying a great
season.

GUARD POSITION UNCERTAIN

Much skepticism exists as to the ﬁcbable starter on the other side
of the center. Mike Milligan, who walks the streets
of Alli uip a during the summer months with a mace
in his an , has been seeing the most action at this
position in training camp, but he is not at all sure of

olding his berth. Ernie Lewis, a reserve ard last
season, and Siegel and Cuba, two husky ya from
last year’: freshman team, are all after the job and
none ofthem is willin to concede the berth to an-
other without a strugg e. Siegel has been bothered
with an infected foot but he is quickly recovering
firiom this ailment and soon expects to be in tip-top
s ape.

' Ralph Daugherty, last year’s pivot man, is back
again and with a season's experience under his belt,
he should have an even greater season this year than

‘ he did last year when he received honorable mention
on several All-American teams.

BACKFIELD STRONG AGAIN

In the backﬁeld where Toby Uansa and Pug Parkinson functioned

so well last year, Pitt will a ain be well balanced
des ite the loss of these two Al -Americans. Captain
E to Baker will be back at uarterback and will
have as his understudies Bucky agner, a veteran of
two ‘seasons; and Rocco Cutri and Zola Alpert, who
divided the signal calling duties for the freshmen
last year.
, At the halfback berths, two veterans and three
sophomores are ﬁghting tooth and nail to arner
starting honors. Josh Williams and Whitey Valiu-
clius, both of whom have been lettermen for the past
“'0 Tears, are the two veterans returning, while
Warren Heller-of Steelton, Pa... Paul Reider of New

Besieged By Sophs

Camp Hamilton, Windber, Pa.——The Pittsburgh Golden
Panthers will play their farewell scene in Camp Hamilton, Sat-

urday, following a three weeks’

engagement here. In spite of

the loss of last year’s All-Americans, Dr. John Bain “Jock”
Sutherland hopes to send onto the stadium gridiron, eleven fast,
ﬁghting men, backed by over a score of competent substitutes.

The annual game, scheduled here for Saturday may deter-
mine the complexion of the 1930 football squad. It is believed

that this game will settle deﬁnite-"

ly the starters
urg. _
Since the beginning of
mage, the reserves have _been
breakin into the varsity lineup.
Althouli the competition for line
berths is keen, the backs ﬁnd them-
selves besieged. The only backﬁeld
position that is even probable is
that of Captain Eddie Baker at
quarter.

Luch Looks Good

At full, there are Jimmv Clark,
165- ound racer, and ranklin
Hoo , 200-pound plun er, from the
varsity material. Wi Hoo<_l’s knee
now in condition and with his pass-
ing abilit , he should prove a threat
in any fu lback position in the coun-
try. But Clark's consistent ains
during’ the past season have p aced
him as the possible starter. '

But from the ranks of the yearl-
in s, comes John
“ arzan” Luch, a
blue-eyed youth
of a slight 220
pounds who has
been ripping the
varsity defense
and plunging oil’-
tackle for long
9. ii d consistent
gains. As full-
back of the Cub
squad last year,
“Tarzan” made
his name. His
ability was first  .
recognized dur-
ing fall training B’?/<6/€
here last sum-
mer, when he cracked the great line
of 1929 for two consecutive touch-
downs, during an afternoon of
scrimmage.

It is from these three men, one
fast and shifty, another a great
passer and a good plunger, and the
third a batering ram of weight and
strength, that Jock must pick his
fullback. --

Brown, Heller Star

Two sophomores and a senior are
vying for the
_ berth that Toby
Uansa leaves va-
cant. Walinchus,
the senior, has
been changed
from right to left
half position.
“Whitey/' substi-
tuting for Josh
Williams 1 a s t
year, landed al-
most a perma-
nent berth at
right half, due to
his ball toting
which was almost
as consistent, but
not so spectacu-
lar as that of Uansa.

gilttacking this seeévningly im IE3};-
na e position are arren e or
and Melvin “Buzz” Brown. Dur-
ing the ﬁrst of the grind, Heller
seemed to push both Walinchus and
Brown into the background, but as
the end comes in sight, both Brown
and Walinchus have come back.
Brown will develop into one of the
ﬂeetest halfbacks that has ever
donned t}l]ie Gold and dBl1}ie. ‘Once,

Prospects Better This Year
Than In 1929

 

Pitt’s freshman and varsity cross-

country teams begin serious practice 2

today after two weeks of intensive
drilling at their homes.

Three dual meets have been ar-
ranged for the varsity while a fourth
with West Virginia is hanging ﬁre.
In addition to thesemeets, the var-
sity will enter the ,I.C.A.A.A.A.
championship meet scheduled for
Van Cortland park in New York on
Nov. 17. The frosh have three duels
already scheduled with a. possibility
that they will encounter the West
Virginia freshman team should the
varsity teams of the two schools
meet.

Prospects for both the varsity and
freshman teams at the University
are better this year than they were
last season. Captain Bob Cabsar,
John Smoyer, Anthony Mazzei,
Glenn Thiele, and George Schmieler
are_ a few of the veterans returning,
while Clise, Tapp, Whelan, and Palli-

Summer Enrollment

 

Three hundred and forty-four de-
grees, including three honorary de-
grees, were granted_ at the annual
commencement exercises ‘of the sum-
mer session, held in Memorial Hall,
August 12. The degrees were con-
ferred by Dr. John G. Bowman,
chancellor of the University.

The largest enrollment in the his-
tory of the summer session was es-
tablished this year when 1,942 stu-
dents registered for the six-week
session which began the ﬁrst of July
and ended during the second week
of August.

Council Appoints‘ 3
Athletic Managers

Three new managers for Pitt
sport teams were appointed by ath-
letic council during the summer va-
cation. ,

R. Herbert Buckman, Phi ‘Epsilon
Pi, was appointed manager of the
varsity track team. Buckman was
manager of the freshman basketball

 

team during the past school year.

Amos Blum, Kappa Sigma, was
appointed manager of the varsity
tennis team. Blum was assistant

-football manager for three years.‘

He is the son of Henry J. Blum, well-
known A. A. U. official.

. Robert Campbell, former appren-
tice football manager, was appointed
manager of the swimming team.

No manager has as yet been
chosen for the cross-country team.

c.ziMPUS sic-our:

a worthy successor to Toby Uansa and the best bet to win the regular
‘left half berth. .
Heller, however, does not have everything his own way. Melvin
Brown and Whitey 'Walinchus, star of Pitt's victory over Nebraska last
year, are both hot after Uansa’s berth. There is a possibility that Wal-
inchus may receive the _nod from Sutherland for the first game, because
he is more experienced than his other two competitors. _ .
At the other halfback berth, South;~aw Josh Williams and Paul Rei-
der, New Castle ﬂash, are having another hot battle for the starting
berth. Williams seems to have the edge over his younger opponent but
Reider is due to see much action this fall. .
