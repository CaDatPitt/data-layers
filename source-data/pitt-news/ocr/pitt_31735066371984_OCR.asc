Professor praises divestiture
as apartheid protests expand

By Karen Frost
Staff Writer

“South Africa is a human tragedy
of major proportions. It is a tragedy
that hurts black Africans who live
there, the African continent and
whites who live there. Although they
(whites) may not realize it, as the
makers of such tragedy, they will,
like the Africans, become its ulti-
mate victims.”

‘— Dr. Emanuel Anise

Victims of the tragedy of apart-
heid -— this was the tone set by Dr.
Emanuel Anise, assistant professor
of African Studies at the University
of Pittsburgh, as he talked about a-
partheid in South Africa at a World
Affairs Council luncheon in Pitts-
burgh on Monday.

Anise, a citizen of Nigeria,
thanked Pittsburgh for bringing
nationwide attention to the problem
of apartheid and urged Pittsburgh
area companies to continue divest-
ing in South Africa.

“Apartheid, simply defined by the
whites in South Africa,” Anise said,
“is a doctrine promoting separate
developments of the races in South
Africa. But this is not what apart-
heid really is, apartheid is a consti-
tutional system designed to
maintain race supremacy.”

This was last "attempted in the
l940s by Adolf Hitler, Anise said.
The result was the holocaust.

“Hitler became powerful because
the people let the system establish
itself,” said Aﬁise. “The Germans
did not realize what Hitler was
about until it was too late to stop
him. Blacks in South Africa must
not let the problem of apartheid

“You can see how the system of apartheid is brutal. I
want Americans to understand what is propelling Afri-
cans in South Africa to say ‘no, more’ to white

oppression. ”

— Dr. Emanuel Anise

reach similiar proportions.”

It is against the law in South
Africa to be a non-racist, Anise
explained. Whites may be jailed or
killed for not discriminating against
blacks. The system hurts both whites
and blacks. '

Black Africans account for 70 per-
cent of, the population in South
Africa, yet they are being governed
by a l7 percent minority of whites.

‘The remaining 13 percent of the

population includes mixed races and
Asians.

Blacks do not have property, vot—_

ing rights or citizenship status, Anise
said. They must carry booklets with
them at all times which list where
they live and work, and when and
where they can use transportation
services. They do not live in the cities
with whites. Instead, they live in
townships outside the cities. The
housing is inferior and the land is in
poor condition. These townships
and other living areas occupy 10 per-
cent of the country's land. The
remaining land is used or occupied
by whites. A black community of
30,000 Africans was recently
uprooted to make way for develop-
ment by whites, he said.
Oppression continues in the work
place despite claims by American
companies that they give equal pay

for comparable work and it is
against South African law for these
companies to pay blacks equal
wages. “The government has passed
laws limiting the amount of money a
black may earn,” Anise said. “Cur-
rently, the ratio of black wages to
whites wages, for équal work, is $500
to $10,000.”

‘Black labor unions were recog-
nized in I977. “Members of these
unions cannot negotiate with man-
agement on any issues dealing with
employment, conditions of work or
anything about«South Africa," he
said, “nor can they petition for re-
dress of grievances against abuses of
their members by their employer."
Anise said labor unions only existto
help the government appear con-
cerned about blacks.

“You can see how the system of
apartheid is brutal,” Anise said. “I
want Americans to understand what
is propelling Africans in South
Africa to say ‘no more’ to white
oppression.”

By investing in “South Africa,
Anise said that American companies
become part of the oppression. He
added that if they continue to divest
and remove their support from the
South African government, black
Africans will be able to continue
their fight against apartheid.

Pittfaculty claim mistreatment  

By Jon Williams
Staff Writer

Faculty ‘members
Titusville campus are complaining
about the mistreatment they have
allegedly received in the past,
according to one member who spoke

‘ at the University Senate's Faculty

Assembly meeting last Thursday.

In a heated exchange of words,
the member said that in recent con-
versations with’University President
Wesley Posvar and his staff, most
negotiations were met with a high
degree of “hostility." In a recent
meeting, the member said that Pos-
var had been too accommodating to
the group.

“In the past number of years,
Titusville has been under constant
attack and slashing [of faculty
members with requests],” the
member said.

Senate Vice President Keith
McDuffie said he was surprised at

this news. McDuffie claimed he had

helped set up for 10 conferences that
Posvar had granted, and he believed
all the groups had been successful in
communicating their desires to the
president.

“I found the meetings favorable,"
McDuffie said. “Posvar was sympa-
thetic, and he showed that he had

“Our history at Titusville has been that we had to fight for
everything from TV to radio. " V .

ed suggestions from the groups.”

The member said that the campus
had not received any considerations
in past talks. Recently, Posvar
opened his office to senate group
members to discuss their places in
the university’s future plans.

McDuffie pointed out that “each
group left, satisﬁed that they had left
an impact on the president. The
groups were well-documented with
their appeals. The nature of the

_requests were somewhat modest, but

the discussions between the two
groups were very productive."

“After such a‘ meeting about the
planning process [ofTitusville's pro-
grams]," the member said, “I don‘t
know what to think —— what their
feelings were or their expectations
before the meeting and after. I don’t

_ know."

The member also said that Posvar

had discussed several items without ‘

l

any of the previous hostility. The
member also expressed his suspicion
at what the president was up to.

“I just don’t know,” the member
said. “Where did this behavior come
from? I don‘t know where. Nothing
in the package we presented was of
major importance. But our history
at Titusville has been that we had to
fight for everything from TV to

‘ radio. I don’t know if there's been a

conversion or not.”

In other business, Professor
David Platt, chairman of the State
Budget Policies Committee, pre-
sented his group's proposal to return
faculty salaries to the I972 level,
adding percentages yearly to equal
the consumer price index. The CPI
is a government figure that repre-
sents the annual adjustments in
salary to urban wage earners and
clerical workers. ‘

Platt said that the increase would
prevent further deterioration of the
salary program.

Authorities oust radicals

(UPI) V Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goodeyesterday promised to
help the people left homeless by a fire that destroyed 60 rowhouses
during Sunday’s confrontation between police and the radical group
MOVE. _ _

The mayor toured the area of devastation in West Philadelphia
yesterday morning and talked to residents whose homes were destroy-
ed in the fire, which began when authorities dropped an explosive
device onto the roof of the MOVE house. .

Goode said the city will help rebuild the neighborhood and make
those left homeless “whole again.”

Goode also denied a Philadelphia Daily News report that three
MOVE members were killed Sunday night in a gunfight with police in
tllC alley behind the MOVE house. He saidcity officials don’t know
the whereabouts of the three MOVE members who apparently
escaped from the fire. One woman, who was arrested, and a child also
escaped from the flames. _

Goode said he should be held responsible for the decisions made in
the confrontation, but he added that no small group should be allowed
to hold the entire city hostage.

Computer Discounts Offered

Moonshine still shut down

(UPI) -— State Liquor Control Board agents have arrested what
they called one of a dying breed -— a large scale moonshiner who
operated a still deep in the woods of southwestern Pennsylvania.

Apprehended Saturday was 46-year-old Wayne Jordan of Mount
Braddock in Fayette County. He was accused of operating a 75—gallon
copper still in a wooded area at nearby Lemont Furnace.

If convicted of misdemeanor charges of manufacture and posses-

sion of moonshine whiskey, he could be-sentenced to a maximum of '

one year or 90 days in jail and a $10,000 fine.

Jordan went through a state police identification procedure and
was released Saturday. He will face a preliminary hearing before
District Justice Eugene Simon of North Union Township.

The seven agents in the state's lone moonshine investigating crew
call themselves the “over the hill gang" because, their business has
slacked. A

Robert Berg, supervisor ofthe LCB’s Pittsburgh Office, said that in
the last five years, there have only been “seven to eight moonshine
busts” originating in his office.

Study disputes Piaget theory,
shows real powers of children

By Karen Frost
Staff Writer

A study at Pitt’s Learning
Research and Development Center
has indicated that psychologists
have underestimated the intellectual
powers of children.

Using dinosaurs as the subject for
their learning and memory study,
psychologists Randi Koeske and
Michelene Chi disproved traditional
theories set by Swiss psychologist
Piaget, who claimed that children
under the ages of ll or 12 could not
form mental links between items or
reason abstractly the way adults can.

Koeske explained that Piaget
believed children of different ages
had different learning capacities.
Young children age three or four
were only able to make concrete
observations. When presented with
two containers holding equal
amounts of water, one tall and nar-
row, the other short and wide, three-
and four-year—olds could not reason
that each container held the same
amount of water. “Until they’re
older, closer to ll and 12,” said
Koeske, “Piaget contended that they
could not make formal observations

or reason that the containers held
equal amounts.”

Kloeske and Chi, however, dis-
covered children making formal
observations at the age of seven.

Two groups of children were stu-
died. The children in one group were
considered dinosaur experts. They
were familiar with different types
and characteristics of dinosaurs.
The other children were novices.
When the two groups of children
were asked to discuss dinosaurs that
were totally unfamiliar to them, the
novice group could only discuss
obvious physical features such as
color and height. The “experts,”
however, were able to discuss these
new dinosaurs beyond the limits of
the novice group.

“They were able to correctly rea-
son that a dinosaur they had never
seen before was a meat eater because
the size and sharpness of its teeth
were similar to other meat eaters
that they were familiar with,”
explained Koeske. These observa-
tions could only be made through
inferences based on the “experts” 
previous knowledge of the species.

The only thing missing from the
Lignt Rail Transit System’s sneak
preview party on May ll were the

offered ‘Pittsburghers food, drink, a
mixture of entertainment and a ride
on the subway, proved to be exciting
and unique for a Pittsburgh fund-
raising event.

such a young age contradicts
Piaget’s theory of a built-in matura-
tion process whereby children would
not develop an inferentia'l process
until the age of ll or l2.

“The key,” said Koeske, “is to
begin within a child’s limited»knowl-
edge of the subject and build up
from that point.” Children who were
already familiar with dinosaurs were
able to learn and retain more infor-
mation about unfamiliar models
than those who lacked a basic
knowledge of dinosaurs. Once a
child is given a basic knowledge of
the subject, his learning and memory
processes work remarkably like an
adult’s, Koeske said. He also
believes that information presented
in an organized manner will be
remembered more easily than infor-
mation presented randomly. Pro-
grams such as “Sesame Street" and
“Electric Company” use these
methods to teach children.

The results of Pitt’s study show
that using the process of inference,
the more children know, the more
they can learn.

University of Pittsburgh Pres-
ident Wesley Posvar reported to
the University Senate Monday
that Pitt’s federal aid may be
reduced.

Posvar said the budget was in
a “state of confusion.” The Rea-
gan administration reportedly
has backed off its attacks on stu-
dent aid, but this has led to a split
in the money put into public
institutions. , Posvar said the
money for the National Science
Foundation and NASA was fro-
zen in the budget process. Posvar
added that if the freeze were
maintained and if Congress con-
tinued its efforts to keep funding
at its earlier spending levels, the
freeze could adversely affect the
CMU-Pitt-Westinghouse super-
computer laboratory.

“The center may be difficult to
get this year,” he said. “If we
don't get it this year, it would be a
mess to have to repeat the
procedure.”

Posvar announced that Tem-
ple, Penn State and Pitt have

ways to eat desserts and await the
subway trolley, which stopped for
guests every two-and-a-half min-
utes. Entertainment was provided
by the Nathan Davis Band, Vic
Cianca (Pittsburgh’s favorite cop),
an organ grinder and monkey, dou-
ble dutch rope jumpers and a
quintet. There was also a shoeshine
stand.

“The word ‘university’ has been

offensive

faced in Pittsburgh this weekend.
The pro-life movement glittered and
glared as supporters took to the
streets with their 7th Annual March
for Life on Saturday, and to the clin-
ics as well.

Friday was the first sign of what
American Abolitionist League
spokesman Mary Bruno referred to
as “a new wave of direct action
against abortion clinics.” Fifteen
local and national members of the
league raided downtown’s Women’s
Health Services, chaining them-
selves to examining tables and caus-
ing minor damage to operating
machines. .,

_ “We’ve realized that if we believe
in a cause, we are going to have to
actively support it,” said Doris
Grady, a member of the American
Abolitionist League and a coordina-

 

tor of Pittsburgh’s People Con-
cerned for the , Unborn Child
(PCUC). Although PCUC is an acti-
vist group, according to Grady, they
limit their protests to sit-ins, picket-
ing and sidewalk counseling (a pro-
cess where pro-lifers position
themselves outside abortion clinics
and offer patients information and
advice, trying to change their minds
against abortion).

As Grady said, “We do not con-
done the bombings and violence, but
we do not condemn it, eithei.”
PCUC is planning their own sit-ins
and protest activities for later in the
year.

“We are going to start finding out
who the doctors are and demon-
strate at their homes,” said Grady.
“We want their neighbors to know
what they do for a living.”

In many cases throughout the
nation, such pro-life demonstrations
have resulted in the loss ofinsurance
leases and personnel for the clinics.

“All over the country we have
clinics that can’t get medical direc-
tors because doctors are afraid of
what the community will do,” said
Phillip Stubblefield, the head of the
National Abortion Federation Med-
ical Committee. To be publically
identified as an abortionist is the
“kiss of death.”

According to Pittsburgh's
Women’s Health Services executive
director, Anne Pride, the pro-life
demonstrations have had the oppo-
site effect in Pittsburgh.

“The demonstrations work in the
opposite of how they were meant.
What seems to happen is people get
very angry. We all believe more

firmly in what we are doing,” said
Pride.

-Women’s Health Services, one of
the three largest abortion clinics in
the U.S., performs over 9,000 first
trimester abortions a year.

“Abortion is a painful option. We
realize that,” said Pride. “People
spend a lot of time making the deci-
sion. But once they do, they are
insulted when they find people out-
side, demonstrating, trying to
change their minds.”

“I think that the media attention
of the pro-life protests has even
resulted in advertising for outpatient
services, and has added to the grow-
ing awareness for the need of safe
abortion services.”

PCUC's Doris Grady disagrees.
She notes a large national and local
increase in membership in the last
few years, and attributes it partly to
the recent media attention the group
has received. The southwestern
Pennsylvania group has reached a
membership of 10,000 this year, and

the strength ofthe group surfaced on

Saturday as 4,000 members turned
out for their annual pro-life march.

“There is not a single group that
has attracted the numbers that we

have,” said Grady. “I attribute it .

solely to education and prayer.”
PCUC has their own program of
education — visiting meetings, clubs
and school children in grades six
through 12 and speaking of abor-
tion, sex and ethics. " ,
“Our prevention program is a
chastity program. Nobody is telling
these kids that it’s OK to say ‘no,’ "

Along with many other parts of
the pro-life movement in Pittsburgh,
PCUC has extended their concern
for the unborn child past the fetus
and into the care of the mother
before and after the baby is born.

“We realize that we had to become
not only pro-life but pro-woman
with pregnancies,” said Mary Win-
ter, the executive director of PCUC.
“We have to break that whole terri-
ble cycle of welfare and poverty that
so often happens to unwed
mothers.”

Pittsburgh is already ahead of the
nation with their efforts in providing
services for ‘ pregnant women.
Although PCUC does nottake a
stance on birth control, the need for
more protection to women who
would carry the child, circumstances
permitting, is part of the common
ground of the pro-life, pro-choice
debate. PCUC itself has initiated
several of these programs, including
the “Incarcerated Mother’s Fund,”
“Women Exploited by Abortion”
and “Mom’s House.” I

The Incarcerated Mother’s Fund
is an organization that provides spe-
cial care for pregnant women in pri-
son. Mom's House, Inc. was
founded by PCUC in 1983 and sup-
plies day care and counseling before
and after pregnancy, to mothers
who would like to continue their
education. According to Winter,
this month the group is fostering the
graduation of three mothers. One
will be graduating from high school

, and marrying the father, one will be

going on to nursing school and one
will be obtaining her master’s degree
from Pitt. .

Women Exploited by Abortion is
a counseling service to help women
who suffer post-abortion emotional
trauma. Mary Beddingfield, who
spoke at the Intercessors for Life
Conference Saturday, is one ofthese
women.

“A lot of us know what abortion
does to the child — but what about
the mother, because no matter what
she does she will always be a mother,
only her baby will be dead,” said

miscarriages as a result of her own
abortion at an early age. “The abor-
tion not only gave me one dead
child, but four.”

Alternatives to Abortion offers a
hotline to pregnant women, as well
as free pregnancy testing, counsel-
ing, and housing like the Genesis
House, which is a temporary resi-
dence and counseling center for
women awaiting childbirth.

Pennsylvanians for Human Life-
Southwest Region, a non-violent,
non-activist pro-life organization
and resource center, sponsors “Life-
line,” an emergency abortion coun-
seling service that treated over

40,000 women in Allegheny County
last year. Their main counseling ser-
vice, CARE (Counseling for
Abortion-related Experience),
counsels both men and women.

“So many times men are over-
looked in the abortion situation,"
said Cecile Hecker, executive direc-
tor of PHL-SW. “Their feelings of
helplessness are ignored and the
man has no control over what
happens.” .

Although abortion has been tradi-
tionally a “female issue,” ‘more men
are beginning to get involved inthe
pro-life force. PCUC’s male mem-
bership has grown and, according to
John Van Horn, the former presi-
dent of Pitt’s pro-life group, their
male membership has suddenly
increased as well.

“It's funny. The group used to be
predominantly female,” said Van
Horn. “Now all of a sudden the
membership has equalled out. More

for Life

men are really getting concerned.”
Part of the disagreement between
pro-life and pro-choice forces is the
ideological battle of the women’s
role — a debate over motherhood
and its place in society. Does the
inability to obtain an abortion limit
a woman’s control over her own
body and reinforce the traditional
male control? '
Both groups turn on the status of
the fetus — pro-life favors the civil
rights of the fetus as a person, pro-
choice favors the mother’s rights and

considers the fetus more of a collec- 5

tion of living cells, rather than “a

V baby?’
Beddingfield, who suffered three .

“The baby is a separate body
inside the mother. The mother is
only the carrier of the child," said
Van Horn. “I think abortion is a
human issue — beyond the boun-
daries of a female issue. I support
equal rights for women, but I think
abortion is a separate issue.”

Feminists for Life is an organiza-
tion that combines the philosophy of
feminism with the pro-life
movement. V

.“A number of women have been
finding out that abortion is not the
answer to the problems women are
facing and they’re doing something
about it," said Cecile Hecker, a

Hecker; the group consists of
women who were feminists but
could not embrace abortion as most
feminist groups have.

“We feel that women today are
being exploited by the men who are
running the abortion clinics," said
Hecker. “Abortion alienates us from
our bodies. We should be concerned
more about each other and help
women to keep their babies.”

Legislatively, the pro-life move-
ment also seems to, be gaining

ground. The proposal by Senator -

Jesse Helms to halt U.S. funds aid-
ing abortion has not been successful
and the Supreme Court affirmed
their original stance in I983. But for
the first time, we have a president
who sides with pro—lifers.

In addition, three members of the
Supreme Court have questioned the
validity of the Roe vs. Wade deci-
sion, and individual states such as
California and Colorado are limit-I
ing abortions and abortion funding.

According to Doris Grady, Penn-
sylvania also seems to be moving in a
pro-life direction. “Pennsylvania
already has a pro-life legislature —
now it’s just a matter of time.”

But as the group emphasizedfat
the Intercessors for Life Conference
Saturday and at t-he rally, the pro-
life movement is more concerned

with lives than laws. As conference V

speaker and pastor Dr. Alfred L.
Pugh said, “This is not a struggle to
change laws. It’s a struggle to

, changes souls ‘and hearts.”

John .Van Horn agrees. “The
image of the pro—lifers has in the past
been that they care about life only
before it’s born,” said Van Horn.
“But we see that if the laws are
changed, there is going to have to be
something for these women.”

John Van Horn and the Pitt pro-
life group, now boasting 50
members and growing, is part of a
national trend in which young peo-
ple are shifting toward conservative,
traditional causes, the pro-life
movement being one of them.

The fact that a large percentage of

abortions are performed on “college ‘

age” women, according to Van
Horn, also makes the cause a more
urgent issue to college students.
“Everyone knows-someone who
has had an abortion. It’s ridiculous,

‘ and our age group is closest to most

of the victims so we can be the ones
to help them,” said Van Horn. “It’s
going to take a lot of cooperation
and time, but hopefully some day
the pro-life movement won’t have to
exist.”

In the meantime, Van Horn and
the rest of the pro-life movement in
Pittsburgh is optimistic. _

“For the first time, the pro—lifers
are starting to feel optimistic,” said
Van Horn. “We’re starting to feel
like we really can make a difference
in this whole issue.”

‘THE"lPlTT"NEWS’ SUMMER MAGAZINE/PAGE 7

Can a woman he a Christian
and feminist at the same time?

3)’ Susan Benedek
Staff Writer

You can be both a Christian and a
feminist. This was the conclusion of
a four—hour conference held Satur-
day at the Lutheran University Cen-
ter.

The conference was sponsored by
the “Academic Bag Ladies,” a
women’s support group at the
Women‘s Center. I

“You can be a feminist and a
Christian, as long as you can stand
it,” said Douglas Mitchell of the
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary.
“How long one can stand it depends
on the particular community of
faith.”

Speaker Jane Sampsell, the
former director of the'Division of
Continuing Education at Pitt’s
School of Medicine, emphasized
that it was important for a working
woman to have liberated male col-
leagues as friends in addition to
developing female friends at the
office. However, she added that
“women should keep this relation-
ship on a professional basis.”

Sampsell also stated that women

should combat sexism in a “gentle
manner" such as remaining silent
during a sexist joke.

However, Joyce Durden, of the
Pittsburgh Seminary, disagreed
with Sampsell‘s “silent approach” to
fighting sexism. “If you are silent
then the oppressor takes it as an
inducement," Durden said.
“Women belong to the culture of
silence. We are the oppressed of the
oppressed.”

Durden said that when con-
fronted with sexism one should be
forceful and respond negatively.
“Whenl was the only woman at a
board meeting and a man turned to
me and told me to go get the coffee, I
replied with ‘no’. They think you’re
crazy but they won’t do it again."

In addition to sexism, Durden
also has had to fight racism. “By the
end of the late 1960s, I had realized
that the church was the only ‘free
institution.’ The legal government
couldn’t destroy it, nor could the
majority. Even the worst racist had a
commitment to the church,” Durden
stated. I

Durden stressed that we must dis-
solve today’s dualistic thinking of

male or female, black or white. We
must instead share power by devel-
oping relational attitudes toward
power. V

"The result of this sharing is like
sitting in a dark room when the
shades are pulled up. The outside
sunshine is not diminished, but the
light inside has changed things a
lot,” said Durden.

Mitchell also pointed out “there is
in each of us male and female but
that is then- defined by our culture as
either masculine or feminine.”

“Christianity and feminism
develop a particular set ofquestions
about character and how to live in
the church as the church lives in the
world," Mitchell said.

Janet Grill, of the Trinity Luther-
an Seminary in Columbus, Ohio.
emphasized that change is possible
when extreme leaders threaten the
moderate institutions to create
change within that institution.

“But how do we maintain our self-
image — our faith in women ~ and
still maintain our religious faith?”
Grill asked. “This is where I look in
the Bible for images of God as
female, and then I lift that up.”

Song is inspiration for concert

By Leslie M. Bennett
Staff Writer

Last night at the Syria Mosque, over 35 local bands and
vocalists ranging in style from pop andjazz to country and rock
‘n’ roll got together on one stage to perform a benefit concert
for the USA for Africa Fund and The Hunger Action Coalition

of Allegheny County, ‘proving that Pittsburgh “can make a ‘

brighter day” for starving people.

The idea for the event originated only a few weeks ago when
local vocalist Tim Stevens thought about putting “We Are the
World,” the American hit to fight world hunger, into his own
act. But the thought only inspired him to try to do something
more —— something all of Pittsburgh could be a part of. H

‘ Within an amazingly short amount of time, “Be a part ofthe
PAAC” became the slogan for the local version of USA for
Africa — Pittsburgh Artists for Africa in Concert, and Tim
became the concert coordinator and all-around mastermind
behind the effort.

Phones began ringing off their hooks with response from
willing artists such as Eighteen Names, G-Force, Jazzbusters,
Haywire and B.E. Taylor, so Tim recruited jazz vocalist
Michele Bensen to assist him in handling it all.

“We’ve had an overflow of calls,” said Michele. “We actually

had to make a cut-off point because with so many people, it
would be difficult to organize the thing to run smoothly.”
_ As an assistant volunteer coordinator at Mayview Hospital
and former director ofthe NAACP, organizing things to run
smoothly is an area in which Tim apparently has some expe-
rience. So while Michele, along with Brandy Young of Brandy
&'Company, worked on lining up performances the chorus for
“We Are the World,” Tim was drumming up media support
and financial backing from local radio stations and
corporations. ‘ ‘I

“It was a real venture of faith for us,” said Tim. “We started
out with no money at all and none committed —~ and I’m not
independently wealthy.” -

Although PAAC didn’t gain as much corporate support as .

Tim. had hoped, he did receive commitments from Mellon
Bank, Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh National
Bank,-andthe University of Pittsburgh.

Other commitments included: DiCesare Engler Produc-
tions, Inc. co-producing the show, National Record Mart sell-
ing tickets at no distribution fee, and Ticket Craft of Bellmore,
N.Y. printing 3,500 tickets.a_t no ‘charge. In addition, Action
Marketing Company and Hollywood Music have agreed to
provide their services at “significantly reduced costs,” and the
Balcony of .Shadyside donated food and beverages for the
performers during the show. i

The city of Pittsburgh made its enthusiasm official when
Tuesday, May 14 was made “Pittsburgh Artists for Africa

Hunger Action

By Dirk Kaufman
Editor

It has been said by many that music is capable of univers_al
communication. People of all nations are able to set aside
differences, if only for a short time, and share in the common
attachment to music.

-Another common trait that all societies unfortunately share
is hunger. In the past six months, the plight of the hungry in
Africa has become a worldwide concern. Due to drought and
the _lack of technology to contend with it, millions of people on
the continent go hungry each day. Thousands are dying of
malnutrition and diseases they are unable _to combat.

The battle against hunger is not confined to Africa, however.
Each day, an organization called the Hunger Action Coalition
serves the needy of Allegheny County. Through approximately
143 food pantries distributed throughout Allegheny County,
HAC provides food for 40 to 45 families every day;

HAC will receive 25 percent of the profit made at last night’s
Pittsburgh Artists for Africa show at the Syria Mosque. The
majority of the money will go to the USA for Africa fund. The
fund and its theme song “We Are the World” were create in
response to British singer Bob Geldof‘s organization of artists
for the recording of “Do They-Know It’s Christmas?"

According to HAC Administrative Assistant Helena Frey,‘
the money gained from the show will go directly to the food
pantry fund. It will be distributed among the pantries that have
been approved by HAC. ‘ . ‘

Most of the organizational work for the show was done
through the HAC office, and there were volunteers from the
organization serving as ushers and general help during last
night’s performance.‘

The HAC is broken down into five major subgroups. The
first, headed by Patricia O’Malley, is Food Resource Counsel-
ing. This group assists persons who need information on aid

through federal and private food programs. O’Malley and her .

staff will talk with the needy person to determine if they are
eligible for aid.

 

 

 

Day” and Mayor Caligiuri released a personal proclamation
fromthe mayor’s office in support of the concert.

In order to ensure adequate media coverage, Tim personally
contacted nearly 20 radio stations, encouraging them to air
public service announcements and to play“We Are the World”
during rush hour with a special mention of the project.

“Tim and I are amazed at the response of the radio stations
and various newspapers in town who are willing**to promote
[the concert],” said Michele.

Publicity, however, doesn’t appear to be the motivation
behind the performers’ enthusiasm. As Michele pointed out,
there really was no support at all when Tim started asking
people to donate their talents. As far as they knew, there would
be no publicity.

“All of these people are doing it out ofthe goodness of their
hearts,” she said.

One of the first groups to get involved in PAAC is a veteran
of recent local benefit concerts — G-Force. It was Ricky Gra-
nati who helped start the first food bank for unemployed
steelworkers with a benefit performance back in April I982 —
the same food bank to which Bruce Springsteen would later
donate $10,000. The Granati family has been part of several
local benefits since then.

It might be said that goodwill efforts have become trendy in
recentiyears with recordings from European and Canadian
artists and even MTV contributing to one causeor another.

“Sure, it’s fashionable to do this,” admitted Hermie Granati.
“But I think we can be proud that Pittsburgh is part of the
trend. Our band is mainly concerned with helping the hungry.

‘Notjust in Ethiopia, but around here. There are people having

a tough time getting groceries.” A

The fact that 25 percent of the proceeds will stay in Pitts-
burgh and go to the 143 food pantries through the Hunger
Action Coalition is significant to many o_f the performers.
Brandy Young, who’s a firm believer that “charity starts at
home,” said she probably would not have participated if the
effort was not, at least in part, a local benefit; “It’s awfully nice
knowing that you can see where your money’s going,”she said.

Tim likes to say that Pittsbrugh Artists for Africa in Concert
is not just a concert but a cause, and the potential benefits are
far more than financial.

“I think that music can do a lot of things for people,” said
Michele. “It’s a universal beacon, or whatever you want to call
it. lt’s a means of making so many people aware of what’s

I happening now.” V ..
Jim (Sputzy) Sparacino of Gigolo agreed. “I think what ‘

we’re doing is bringing everybody together. You’ve got funk-
sters like us, and Haywire for the middle—of-the-road country
type and jazz people like Michele and Jet Set. When you touch
that many people, you’ve got to have something good
happening.” ‘

  Coalition helps local needy

In addition to need assistance, this group also works with the
Allegheny County Board of Assistance to help clients obtain
food stamps they might lose through caseworker error or
bureaucratic red tape, according to an information newsletter
put out by the organization. ’

A second group in the HAC system is Emergency Food
Assistance. This is a county-wide hunger hotline for people in
need of food. This group often serves those victims of fire, theft,
delay of benefits or illness. According to the brochure, after a
client calls, he or she is evaluated for need and is either accepted
or denied according to the evaluation. _

The Pantry Development Program works to strengthen and
expand the existing pantry’ food program. This group
researches areas of identified need and approaches church,
union and other organizations to inquire about desire to open a
food pantry. For those that express the desire to open a pantry,
this group will provide technical assistance in getting a system
started. »

The Public Policy Advocacy Program promotes change in a
system that perpetuates poverty, inequality and hunger,
according to the HAC brochure. They hopeto initiate action
by government officials and through voter registration and
education. According to Joni Rabinowitz, coordinator of the
program, they are concerned with the policies of private corpo-
rations that perpetuate hunger and poverty.

“Policies of Nestle’s and Campbell’s create hunger,” she

commented. g
The final subgroup is the Hunger Research and Education
Program. Coordinator Barbara Murock and her staff are

working to illustrate the overall picture of local hunger."
. Included in the work of the group is work with a local univer-

sity to develop a comprehensive study of hunger in Allegheny
County. Also, they will be forming- a low-income advisory
board to work with the HAC. This advisory council will
attempt to foster a greater understanding of low-income prob-
lems and to instruct the low-income population on advocacy of
social programs to assist them.

Low attendance diso

By Leslie M. Bennett
Staff Writer

Two musical groups of children
and young people set the mood for
The Pittsburgh Artists for Africa
Concert last night. The VanniEle-
mentary School Chorus opened the
show with their own charming,
squeaky-voiced version of “Amer-
ica“, and Civic Light Opera Mini-
stars soon followed belting out “We
are the world, we are the children”
just like the pros.

Of course, with over a dozen acts,
covering the spectrum of musical
styles, the general pulse of the show

  

would change with every number.
But the mood revealed by the per-
formers remained the same, for the
most part, reflecting a child-like
pride.

These musicians did well to hide
their disappointment at the poor
attendance of the show, and kept
their enthusiasm up despite it.

An explanation for the small
crowd? Maybe it was the $l0.50
ticket price. But if you consider that
for a five-hour concert, that’s only
$2. l0 an hour, and it’s not unreaso-
nable ~ especially for such a diverse
concert. How about the fact that
there are relatively few college stu-
dents in town this time of year who

\

might have otherwise attended? Pos-
sibly, but $10.50 is pretty much to a
student these days, no matter what
the cause. A lack of interest? Poor
social awareness? Whatever the rea-
son, an awful lot of people certainly
missed an event where there was
something for everyone.

There was_ Larry Lee Jones, a hot
cross between‘ Neil, Diamond and
Kenny Rogers, and the Ella Fitzge-
rald type of swing from Brandy &
Company. Shaker boogied with
covers “Let it all Blow Down" slid-
ing right into “Smooth Operator,”
inspiring some to dance in the rear of
the Syria Mosque’s auditorium.

jumped in the aisles with’ their own
recently recorded “Dangerous
Man," a gutsy rock-n-roll tune
backed with some powerful sax.
The show provided a nice melting
pot of Pittsburgh’s musical talents as
well as radio personalities from
WIXZ, WYEP, WDSY and others
announcing each number. Moving
close to a hundred musicians and
vocalists on and off the stage could
have been a logistical nightmare, but
thanks to the sound services and
equipment from Hollowood Music,
PAAC seemed to get through the
evening with a minimum of‘techni-
cal difficulties. The only problem

By Stephen Lewis
Staff Writer

With the weekly food bought,
my apartment suitably tidied
and the day getting warm, I
decided to make my way out into
Oakland, specifically to the
Post-Industrial Book Store at
Semple and Ward streets in
south Oakland.

I had been there once before
about five weeks ago, when I
found myself short of change for
the washing machines at the
Coin-Op Laundry across the
street. Because the Post-
Industrial Book Store is the clos-

est business — and because I had’

intended to drop in since its
opening three weeks before -— I
ran across the street to see if I

_ could get my dollars changed for

coins. Before asking the fellow

Gotcho

By Delores Rice
Staff Writer

Movie advertisements and
previews have one purpose: to
sell. Often what is promised is
not delivered and occasionally
you, get more than you’d
expected. Gotcha, recently
released by Universal Pictures IS
an example of the latter.

Gotcha has been billed as yet
another teeny-bopper flick
about a college freshman trying
to change his virginal status. The
more experienced, serious
moviegoer would immediately
pass up this ad in search ofsome-
thing more original and
‘entertaining.

There would be no problem if
Gotcha fell easily into the ranks
of "The Last American Virgin or

Porky's, but this film offers so

much more.

Jonathan Moore (Anthony
Edwards of Revenge of the
Nerds and The Sure Thing) is a
regular James Bond when it
comes to a college game he and
his buddies play. Unlike 007,
however, his lust for the ladies is
not reciprocated. In an earnest
attempt to change his luck, Jon-
athan goes cavorting in Europe
with his womanizing roommate,
Manolo (Nick Corri) during
spring break. When his spouting
of dirty French brings ill affects,
Jonathan fears his bad luck has‘
followed him.

Then he meets Sasha Bana-
chek (played superbly by Linda

. Sasha proceeds

behind the counter for change, I
made a rather cursory inventory
of the store, hoping to find some-
thing inexpensive but worth-
while to purchase, thereby
coming about change by the
simplest and _most legitimate
means. Much to my disappoint-
ment, there was very little on the
shelves, and what was there was
of either highly specialized inter-
est or of no interest at all. Decid-
ing that there was nothing to
buy, I asked the fellow behind
the counter if he could give me
change for a five. He said that
no, he couldn't, so I went to the
bar next door for change, firmly
convinced that the Post-
Industrial Book Store wouldn’t
last more than a few months.

So when I went out into the
warm and sunny afternoon on
Sunday, my reason for specifi-
seeking out the Post-
Industrial Book Store was not to

=——-Entertoinment—————*

expand my horizons or pick up a
few cute “out of the main way”
titles by well-known and well-
loved authors, but rather to go
someplace close which wasn't
worthwhile enough to make me
lose track of time. (This is what
people without TV sets do on
Sunday afternoons). ‘
When I walked into the store,
I was amazed. The shelves were
full, the windows were opened
and there were two people
browsing through the books,
each taking‘ one off the shelf,
leafing through it, putting it
back, tucking one under an

elbow to keep and going through’

more books.

I went to the far left-hand
corner at the front of the store to
a- section titled “Architecture.”

There was a relatively small co1- I

involved in the middle of some
-serious international espionage.

At thispoint, the "coming of
age” premise takes the backseat
to a dangerous cat-and-mouse
situation. Jonathan is chased by
Vlad (German actor Klaus
Loewitsch) through East Berlin,
West Germany and eventually
his homefront, Los Angeles.

The locations are used to good
effect by director Jeff Kanew
(Revenge of the Nerds): Paris
and its non-existant speed limits,
West Germany’s beer and sing—a-
longs, east Berlin’s incredible
customs procedures and Ameri-
ca’s (yes, we’re implicated, too)
mix-ups and run arounds.

The supporting characters
also leave a strong impression,

especially Jonathan’s parents:
his father (Alex Rocco) who’s
obsessed with money and being
hip and his mother (Maria
Adams) who watches too much
“Hour Magazine” and reads too
many Psychology Today arti-
cles. She believes that her son’s
story was drug-induced.

Gotcha’s good points include
its soundtrack, which consists of
primarily contemporary British
music. The soundtrack, which
includes Frankie Goes to Holly-
wood’s Relax and Two Tribes
Go to War, heightens every sus-
penseful moment with sudden
intrusions, complementing the
dialogue and action, perfectly.

Gotcha’s plot is not as thick as
Gorky Park. Nor is it as thin as
Risky Business. Like both of
these films, however, it is com-
pelling entertainment with a lit-
tle suspense, comedy and
romance. Gotcha? Hope so!

architecture from the Georgian
through the Greek Revival
period, a two-volumeset on New
England architecture and nearly
20 titles on the history of interior
architecture. The gem of the
entire collection, though, was a-
small 4 - by - 6 inch book titled,
plainly enough, Architecture:
From Its Origins to the Present
Day. It is a surprisingly complete
little work by Charles Rambert,
a respected French architect and
former editor of “L’Architecture
Francaise.” The book has 235
pages with an economy of words
and 288 illustrations, including

I diagrams and full-color pictures.

Beneath the architecture sec-
tion was a section titled “Art,”
which included books on art his-
tory, art criticism and collections
with actual plates of paintings
and etchings.

The poetry section was even
more complete, with works
ranging from classical Greek
poetry —— Ovid, Homer, Juvenal
— to a book composed entirely
of rugby poetry, complete with
asterisks to delete the naughty
words.

The section marked “Litera-
ture” took up a full wall of tall
and well—stocked shelves —
more than most commercial
bookstores —— and wasn’t littered
with things like The Thorn Birds
and titles by Danielle Steele, like
the high-priced Walden and B.
Dalton chains are.

I wound up spending over two
hours there, thoroughly losing
track of time and coming away
with “Architecture,” which I
purchased for less thanlthe price
of one load of washing with
detergent.

Beyond Theropy:
o porode ot silliness

By Leslie M. Bennett
The Pitt News

Pittsburgh Playhouse’s cur-
rent production of Christopher
Durang’s « silly new comedy
_Beyond Therapy parades an odd
group of characters, to say the
most. An egotist, a scatterbrain,
a bisexual, a homosexual and a
fraidy-cat woman confront one
another apparently to discover

better perspectives on their mod- "

ern mixed-up lives. However,
Durang’s purpose seems as
unclear as his characters’; His
play gushes sharp-tongued one-
liners racing toward obscenity
but never really goes anywhere.
Instead, Durang settles for belly
laughs that barely. cease.

The character who eventually
turns out to be the protagonist is
Prudence (Robin Walsh), a mis-
guided journalist in her 30s who
seems to be the only one who
knows what she wants but is
unfortunately too insecure to get
it. In her attempts to find the
love of her dreams, a man some-
where in between Matt Dillon
and Cary Grant, Prudence meets
Bruce and subsequently Bruce’s
male lover, Bob. (Bruce goes
both ways; Bob’s strictly gay.)

At first, Prudence is dismayed
by Bruce’s sexual preferences
and his emotional openness -
his free and frequent bursts into
pitiful sobbing —- so she seeks
advice from‘ her therapist, a
would-be womanizer thorough-

ly preoccupied with rationaliz-
ing his own sexual imperfec-
tions. '

Likewise, Bruce visits hisown ,

therapist, whose confused chat-

terings convince him to above all ‘

take risks in life and pursue
Prudence. .

The play proceeds with a spo-
radic series of pokes and jabs at
the freeform lifestyle and mental
health professions. of trendy
urban society. '

Taking advantage of some
shockingly blunt ‘ and uncen-
sored dialogue, Durang goes for
the instant reactions rather than
building tension or developing
his characters. These are basi-
cally stock characters after all.

Prudence’s shrink Stuart

(Marty Schiff) is the macho

chauvinist in all the typical ways,
and Bob (Chris Josephs) isn't
much more than a whining
mama’s boy. -

The most amusing character

‘has to be Charlotte, the babbling

psychologist who can’t recall
common words, let alone her
patients, and who talks ador-
ingly to a stuffed Snoopy. Susan
'McGregor-Laine’s performance
remains fresh and delightful in
some otherwise stale scenes.
The rest of the cast presents
pleasing, though somewhat de-
tached, performances. At least

established acting careers. David

PAYBACK

Vietnam may appear as a wak-

confront or embrace its lessons.
For whatever reason, Joe Klein’s
Payback feels like a bit of cathar-
sis coupled with a strong dose of
reality that never quite vanishes

developing the stories of five
Marines, men who fought
together on a battlefield called
Que Son Valley with a mission
called Operation Cochise. By

giving each man his own space
and rhythm, Klein’s book makes
perhaps the most potent Ameri-
can journalistic statement to fol-

sensationalism there is pays for
itself by increasing the impact of
the book’s airtight narrative.
This is as it should be, for the
more Klein allows the strong
emotions of the interviewed vet-
erans — in the face of an Amer-
ica that is foreign to its returning
citizens — to come through
(some gradually, others rapidly),
the more one can measure the

younger writers, “The best non-

throughout Payback, but espe-
cially when Klein takes us
through the horrific experience
of Operation Cochise. He writes
of this with the attention of a
learned historian and a traveled
documentary cameraman, using
words rather than film to cap-

SAM COOKE LIVE AT THE
HARLEM SQUARE CLUB,
1963

Sam Cooke

RCA

Sam Cooke was murdered in
1964 at the age of 33, at the
height of his powers as an enter-
tainer. He was unquestionably
one of the most influential musi-
cians of the last 30 years. This
legacy is still resoundingly
obvious in the singing styles of
everyone from Smokey Robin-
son to Rod Stewart to .lourney’s
Steve Perry. With a string ofhits
beginning in 1957 with “You
Send Me” and continuing with
songs like “Twistin’ the Night
Away,” “Cupid,” “Wonderful
World” and “Chain Gang,” he

cemented his standing as one of
the fathers of modern soul.
RCA has just released Sam
Cooke Live at the Harlem
Square Club, 1963, a valuable
new glimpse of Cooke in his ele-
ment, the “chitlin” night club cir-

. cuit. The only other live album

previously available was l964’s
Sam Cooke at the Copa, which
was slicker and more imme-
diately marketable than this new
record.

The record presents Cooke as
he has never before been heard
—— rough, funny, down-to-earth,
completely at home with his
audience who are an active part
of the show. His voice has that
magical_ability to soar up to
throaty high notes, come back
down and make it sound so

   

 
 

I oke

effortless that you try it yourself,
much to your embarrassment.
Each of the nine songs on this
record bops with a vengeance -
they're all classics. The high

point is a fiery, ad-libbed version
of “You Send Me,” which leads
into “Bring It On Home to Me."
Cooke talk-sings a story about a
fight with his “baby”: Oh, but I
get to feeling so alone, and I call
my baby on the telephone. 1
ﬁnally get somebody on the tele-
phone and I say ‘Who is this?‘
Somebody say, ‘This is the oper-
ator.’ I say, ‘I don ‘I want you,
operator’(and here he clicks into
that amazing tenor of his) ‘I want
my baa-aaby... ‘Well, I guess you
have to hear it.

The truly remarkable thing
about this record, though, is its
freshness: There is nothing that
sounds dated in any sense. It
sounds like it might have been
recorded yesterday, except for
the slightly grainy production.

“ ‘M‘A‘Y’i' 5;‘ T985

Sam Cooke Live at the Har-
lem Square Club, 1963 will
prove to be an important record.
It presents a legendary per-
former in a very different light
than he has previously been con-
sidered. Here is a man and his
audience totally at ease with
each other, comfortable in one
another’s company and confi-
dent that everyone is having a
wonderful time. The joy in
Cooke’s voice is unmistakable,
and it’s mirrored in the delight of
the voices that eagerly shout and
sing back to him at his slightest
request. More raw, unaffected
happiness you’re not likely to
find on too many other records.

Minutemen: in search of perfected pop

l_’RO]ECT: MERSI-l
The Minutemen
SST ’

The Minutemen, whose last
album sounded more like the
band's diary than anything
else, has, with their latest EP
Proiect:Mersh come closer to the
finished product.

Don't get me wrong — both
of these are fine records. The
only real criticism of Double
Nickels on the Dime was that the
songs were too short and per-
haps underdeveloped. On Pro-
ject:Mers_h, there are hooks all
over the place, and as any Len-
non/McCartney or Jagger/Ri-
chards will tell you: "You just

need one.”

Yes, Project: Mersh, like their
last record, is packed with
ideas. The only difference is
length. Double Nickels boasted
40 songs while Mersh contains

only four originals, one cover.

(”Hey Lawdy Mamma" by
Steppenwolf)-and one annoying
chant. Brevity aside, there’s a lot

here.

”Cheerleaders," the first
song on the record, is a
bouncy, early- '60s sounding
pop song which expresses
serious sentiments on such
things as ”body bags” and
”heads in the sand” in a
tongue-in-cheek tone with
horns in

the background

sounding remarkably similar
to those in the theme to ”Bar-
ney Miller.” ”King of the Hill”
is another anti-establishment
song with a compelling rising
action leading into the chorus.
The two other ”real” songs are
”Take Our Test,” which
sounds much like Squeeze on
speed, and ”Tour Spiel." ”Tour
Spiel” is the Minutemen’s ”It's
hell on the rock ’n’ roll road
blues,” with a series of surpris-
ingly iethereal—sounding
acoustic guitar breaks.

The commom denominator
is drive. With the rhythmn
section of Mike Watt on bass
and George Hurley on drums
backing the dynamic guitar
work -and other antics of D.
Boon, the bad can't be less than
exciting. Perhaps more impor-
tant is that in the long run the
Minutemen are not afraid to
take chances. They are con-
stantly re-inventing their
sound.

What will the final product
be? Who knows  the great

Vasvary getting his runners

,_ ready for ICAA/\A's

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

The Pitt men's track and field
team made their first home appear-
ance in the 15th annual Pitt Track
and Field Outdoor Invitational last
weekend at Pitt Stadium. Pitt
runners took six firsts in an impres-
sive performance.

Leading the way was sophomore
Tim Manes. Manes won the 800-
meter run and anchored Pitt’s vic-
torious l,600-meter relay team en
route to recieving the Arthur C.
Toner award for the meet’s out-
standing performance.

Not far behind Manes in terms of
performance were Lee McRae and
Jason Harris. McRae, a freshman
from Pembroke, N.C., continued to
show the form....that made him an
indoor All-America as he won the
I00-meter dash. McRae posted a
personal best of 10:31, good enough
to qualify for the NCAAs.

Harris, a sophomore from East
Orange, N.J., took first in the 400-
meter intermediate hurdles with a
time of 52.00. Harris’ time was good
enough to qualify him for the
ICAAAA Championships
weekend at Penn State. Ten other
Panthers also qualified.

Pitt coach John Vasvary was
quite satisfied with his squad’s per-
formance. “I was very pleased,” said
Vasvary. “We had some very good

Jelic, Stennett,

performances." Vasvary thought
that being atihome for the first time
this season gave his team an edge.
“Being able to sleep in your own bed,
not having to travel was good for

' us,” said the third—year coach.

The upcoming lCAAAAs will
present a challenge for the Panthers,
and Vasvary is confident, but is
making no promises. “We’ll do as
well as we can,” said Vasvary. “Each
of us will do the best we can.”

Vasvary will be taking a young
squad to the ICAAAAS. Of the 10
Panthers who qualiﬁed, there will be
only one senior and onejunior. The
senior, Darryl Shepherd, maybe
more familiar to Pitt sports enthusi-
asts on the basketball court, quali-
fied in the ,l I0-meterhigh hurdles.
Joining Shepherd in that event will
be Harris, freshmen Calvin Holmes
from Newport News, Va. and
George lffel from Philadelphia.

The onlyjunior is sprinter Dorrell

Hilliman from Plainfield, N.J. Hilli-

man, along with McRae, qualified in
the 200-meter dash. McRae also

qualified for the I00-meter dash.

Joining Harris in the 400-meter
intermediate hurdles at the
ICAAAAS will be lffel, Holmes and
sophomore Shane Saunders from
Long Island, N.Y. Manes will be
competing in the 800-meters along

"with freshman Joe Daniels.

The competition will be stiff, with
teams the caliber, of Penn State and
Villanova competing, but for a team

as young as Pitt, anything ‘can v

happen.

named first

team All-Big East Cnterence

By Jim Urban
Sports, Editor

The Big East_ Conference
announced its All—Big East baseball
team today, and by no surprise, two
Pitt Panthers made the squad. Out-
fielders Matt Stennett and Chris
Jelic were both honored for their
performances this past season. Sten-
nett, a sophomore from Shaler, and
Jelic, a junior from Mt. Lebanon,
form_ the heart and soul of the
Panther attack. -

Stennett and Jelic both finished in

’ the Top Ten of the Big East batting

race. Stennett finished second, bat-
ting .426. Stennett added six home
runs, 13 RBIs and scored 20 runs.
Stennett’s efforts were good
enough to earn him Big East Player
of the Week honors for the week
ending May 13. During that week,
Stennett was 4-7 with three home
runs, all in consecutive at-bats dur-
ing a I3-3 win over Villanova. His
other hit was a bases-loaded triple in

a l5-5 win, also over the Wildcats. .

Jelic’s accomplishments list 26
hits, including five doubles and four
triples, as he split time between the
catcher position and the outfield.
Neither players are slouches in the

 
    

”Chriis—JelicA:

field: Stennett boasts a .976 ﬁelding
percentage, while Jelic finished at
.987 with I4 assists.

Both Jelic and Stennett are two-
sport athletes at Pitt. In the fall, Jelic
doubles as a punter and Stennett is a
ﬂanker for the football team for
coach Foge Fazio.

Baseball Bits: In other Pitt baseball
news, senior Paul Westwood has
been busy setting records. The short-
stop from Peabody recently set two

Matt Stennett

school records with one swing of the
bat. During a recent series against
Georgetown, Westwood hit his 15th
career homerun, a new record. That
same hit also turned out to be his
I l9th career hit, also a new reocrd.
Not to miss any bases, that same hit,
which was Westwood‘s seventh
homerun this year, tied that record,
and it also tied the record for team
homeruns (24) in a season. West-
wood finished the year with a .342
batting average.

Eugene “Junie" Lewis says he wants to remain a

Pitt Panther.

Junie says he wants
to stay at Pitt

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor"

In a sudden change of direc-
tion, Pitt guard Junie Lewis last
night declared that he wants to
remain a Panther. Lewis, who
had earlier said he wanted to
transfer to LaSalle, Villanova or
Massachusetts, now has his mind
set on straightening things out
with RoyiChipman and staying
at Pitt.

Speculation began on Mon-
day concerning Lewis’ future,
when The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported Lewis’ inten-
tions of transferring. The article
quoted Lewis as stating, “I feel if
I stay here, I won’t play as much
as I_‘should.”

Last night, Lewis told The Pitt
News “Things might change in
the near future. Coach [Chip-
man] and I haveto work some
things out." Chipman was not
available for comment.

Lewis came to Pitt from
Abington High School near
Philadelphia. The 6-2 guard
signed with Pitt before his senior
season, then proceeded to have a
superb senior year that was
capped by a 28-point perform-
ance and the MVP trophy in the
Dapper Dan Roundball Classic
at the Civic Arena.

When Lewis arrived at Pitt, he
was relegated to the bench
behind Joey David, Curtis Aiken
and classmate Demetreus Gore.
Lewis averaged just over four
points per game in limited
action, but he did show signs of
potential greatness in games
against Duquesne and George-
town. It seems that Lewis‘ run-
nin’ and gunnin’ didn't fit into
Chipman’s defense-oriented
game until Chipman needed

some quick points. But it was
usually toolate in the game for
Lewis to lead the Panthers back
from big deficits.

Lewis spoke candidly last
night: “I really don‘t want to
leave Pittsburgh. I’ve become
close to a. lot of people since I
came here.”

According to the article in. The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Lewis
had already spoken to_ Sam
Rines, an assistant at LaSalle,
and showed interest in the
school. But another LaSalle
assistant, Joe Mehalic, claimed
nothing of the sort had occurred.
When told of Lewis’ intentions to
transfer, Mehalic replied,
“That’s news to us.” Mehalic
denied any communications

“I really don ‘I want
to leave Pittsburgh .”

— Junie Lewis

between the two parties. “He
hasn't contacted us," he said.
“He hasn’t called, and this just
seems to be speculation.”

Lewis is still on campus,
attending classes during Pitt’s
spring session. He admitted that“
LaSalle did look good because of
its proximity to where he grew
up, but now he wants to stay in
Pittsburgh.

One thing is for sure: There
will be no shortage of guards on
the Pitt basketball team next fall.
Players returning for Chipman
include Lewis (if he stays),
Aiken, David, Gore and John
Blanton. Players to be added are
freshmen Mike Goodson and
Jerome Lane.

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

University of Pittsburgh officials
announced last weekend that Steve
Lewis has been named head coach of
Pitt's women’s track team. Lewis,
who has been at Pitt the past three
years as an assistant to the men’s
track team under John Vasvary, was
named to replace Elbert Kennedy,
who was fired amid controversy on
March 2|.

Lewis’ past is highly regarded.
Before coming to Pitt, Lewis spent
12 years as a nationally respected
coach at Menchville High School in
Virginia. While there, Lewis devel-
oped 34 All-Americas, four national

Kingdom to

record holders and I2 state cham-
pionship teams. Pitt did not have to
look far to replace Kennedy, only
right down the hall.

“He has tremendous credentials,"
said assistant athletic director for
women’s sports Carol Sprague. “He
can work with a wide range of ath-
letes, and we needed someone who
could do that.”

Lewis is no stranger to Pitt’s
women's track team. When
Kennedy was fired, Lewis and Vas-
vary temporarily took over the
women‘s team until a replacement
could be found. The women’s team
only has five members this spring,
but under Lewis all five have posted
personal best times this spring.

Lewis will continue as an assistant
to Vasvary for men's track, and Vas-
vary will continue to serve as track
coordinator.

Steve Lewis

l<es first place

in Modesto Invitational

Pitt’s Roger Kingdom won the
110-meter hurdles at the Modesto
Invitational in California over the
weekend. Kingdom broke the tape
with a time of 13.14 seconds, the
fastest ever at the event.

Pitt fans will recall last summer
when Kingdom upset favorite Greg
Foster to win the Olympic Gold
‘Medal in the same event at Los
Angeles. Kingdom is a former defen-
sive back on the Pitt football team.

Pitt wome_n’s swimming coach
David Belowich has announeedthe

signing of four recruits. Belowich '

has signed two local girls, Margie
Paulick from Bethel Park, Gayle
Wyland from Glenshaw and Tricia
Rickert, a high school All-America
from Wilmington, and Maureen
Cleary, a breast stroke specialist
from Rochester, N.Y.

Belowich’s Lady Panthers are the
defending Big East champions.

Robert Morris College’ basketball
coach Jarrett Durham announced
the signing of his second recruit over
the weekend. Durham signed 6-6
forward Anthony Dickens from Erie
Strong Vincent High School.

Dickens was a second-team all-
state performer who averaged 17
points and 13 rebounds last year. He
came on strong late in the season
and gained a berth in the feature
game of the prestigious Dapper Dan
Roundball Classic at the Civic
Arena in early April.

Paul Westwood, shown here against the USA Olympic Team last summer,
recently became Pitt's career leader in hits. ‘
