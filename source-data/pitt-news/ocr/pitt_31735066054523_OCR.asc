' Planning acquired funding to study

_ If implemented, the project will

...§-fifrom Bellefield Avenue to
"’.'_;_lChildren’s Hospital on McKee
 Place.

Pitt Director of Local Relations

in '- Jay Roling said the University
’ backs the stud-y.

“Anything that reduces the
width of the street and increases the
safety of the students is supported

- by the University,” Roling said,

Pitt Police already intend to add
more officers to the area near Fifth
and Bellefield avenues and also to
begin reprimanding more student
jaywalkers.

City planning data from 1993
showed that approximately 126,000
vehicles moved through Oakland
via Fifth Avenue every day, yet only

24 percent is actually Oakland traf-
fic. The rest was traveling down-
town, according to the report.

Bob Harkins, Pitt’s director, of
Parking, _ Transportation and
Services, said the best situation
would be to decrease the amount of
traffic on Fifth Avenue. .

“If the city found an alternate
route to go downtown, there would
be less_ of a traffic problem in
Oakland,” Harkins said. " . _

Harkins said the study will be
beneficial to pedestrians in the long
run.
“Anything that will improve the
quality of life on campus would be
wise to look into,” he said.

Sidney Kai—Kai, who is oversee—-
ing the study for the city, said that it"

is slightly premature to discuss the
project because it has not yet been
released to the public.

But Kai—Kai did say the aim of
the study is to find the impact it
will have on traffic and pedestrians
on. Fifth Avenue and its intersecting
streets. v .
Solutions suggested in the past
include building a bridge above
Fifth Avenue like the one over
Forbes Avenue, a tunnel underneath
Fifth Avenue, or a four—way traffic

A prehistoric man nestles a baby wrapped in animal hide to keep it warm. The
figures are part of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History's new evolution exhibit.

Staff Writer

Neanderthals have anived in Oakland.

“Ancestors Unearthed: The Mystery of
Human Origins” opens at the Carnegie
Museum’ of Natural History Saturday and
will be on display until Jan. 10.

More than 20 of the world’s leading
anthropologists and paleontologists spent
more than a century working in Europe to
develop the exhibit, which cost over $4 rnil-
lion to put together.-

“It’s the most comprehensive and sci-
entiﬁcally accurate natural-history exhibit
of all tinfe,” said Jay Apt, director of the

' Carnegie Museum of Natural History. “It’s
a fascinating adventure.”
The Carnegie Museum is only the sec-
ond museum in the United States to have
I this exhibit It premiered at the Oregon
Museum of Science and Industry in
Portland. . .. _ -
“We’re very lucky to have it here,” Apt
said »

The 10,000-square—foot exhibit con-
tains more than 30 moving and speaking
animalronic ﬁgures that seem to come‘ to
life. These ﬁgures, which are in realistic
landscape, show how early humans lived.

The exhibit can be interesting to both
the young and the old, and especially to col-
lege students, said Dan Lagiovane, a media
relations associate for the museum.

‘College is when you explore who you
are and challenge your beliefs,” said
Lagiovane. “This exhibit can appeal to

  evolution in 30 minutes

everyone. We’re all curious [about] where
we came from.”

Visitors to the museum enter the exhib-
it through a rock portal that is created to
make visitors feel as if they have been Hans-
ported back in time. First, visitors anive at a
replica of the ﬁeld lab of famous anthropol-
ogist Richard Leakey, in which the anima-
tronic ﬁgure talks about the signiﬁcance of
fossil fuels. —

After listening to Leakey’s “talk,” visi-
tors have the opportunity to see four diora-
mas of how humans have evolved and an
exit scene of how we might be viewed in
thefuture. ' ' .

The first diorama is of the
Auslralopithecines, dating 3 to 4 million
years ago. These are the earliest known
ancestors of humans who walked on two
feet and used primitive tools. The anima-

, tronic ﬁgures are surrounded "by lush, green

plants and trees, and they are shown look-
ing for food in the trees and defending
themselves from an attacking hyena.

The second diorama is of Homo erec-
tus/Homo ergaster, dating 1.5 to. 1 million
years ago. The species is shown in a ﬁeld
caringfor the sick and hunting an antelope.
They are much taller and heavier than the
Australopithecines. . l

The third diorama is of the
Neanderthals, dating 100,000 to 50,000
years ago. The Neanderthals are in a cave,
dressed in animal skins. Some are busy
gathering food and ﬁrewood, while others

Many students burn
blockson 5
high-priced items
such as

botﬂed water, milk
and other ‘
prepackaged foods.
But Food Services
Director Betsy
Sallade-Farina said
she wants Sodexho
to provide fruit,
cereal and other
dietary staples.

RicH RAMAGE/FOR THE Pm News

 

Sodexho:Good reason for prices

' Chris Griswold

Staff Wrlter
Where can Pitt students buy a liter of

Aquaﬁna bottled water for $1.85? A quart C

of milk for $1.60? Price-wary students
know they can ﬁnd these products for
these prices only at Eddie’s. But it’s not

a without good reason, according to Food

Services and Sodexho ofﬁcials.

Previously, Food Services Director
Betsy Sallade-Farina made a blanket
statement saying Food Services makes
sure Sodexho keeps its prices 5
percent, of street prices. When asked about
the statement, Sallade-Farina explained
the "restriction "applied only to prepared
meals.

The 5—percent restriction does not,
however, apply to packaged foods or gro-
cery items available at Eddie’s and
Schenley Cafe. Water, milk, potato chips
and cereal are sold at higher prices than
those of Giant Eagle or 7-Eleven; ' _

The prices at Eddie’s are “deﬁnitely
higher,” said sophomore Myra Meislik.
“Pepsi’s deﬁnitely more expensive. I can
go to Rite-Aid and get a bottle for $.99. I’d
pay much more here.”

Sallade-Farina said she doesn’t think
it makes sense for Sodexho to sell many
of the groceries because it can’t sell them
at affordable prices.

“I think it’s important for [Sodexho]
to sell the kinds of things students rely on,
like fruit, milk and cereal,” she said.

Sallade-Farina says’ she considers
such items staples. She said other items
like bottles of carbonated beverages and

- candy, however, are not quite as essential.

“I don’t care so much if they offer that
stuff or not,” she said. “I asked them not to
sell the Swedish ﬁsh last semester because
they were too expensive.”

Eddie’s sold boxes of Swedish ﬁsh

‘ for two blocks, equivalent to $9.30.

Despite the price, Sallade-_Farina said
Sodexho could not keep the candy in
stock.

“It’s real tricky knowing what to
offer,” she said. “We want to offer things
students want to purchase.”

“We would prefer not to sell any
packaged items,” said Sodexho district
manager Andrea Spandonis. “But we have
a large population of students looking for
those items. People do look for the bottled
water, for example.”

But Eddie’s sells liters of Aquaﬁna for
$1.85, nearly twice Giant Eagle’s 95
cents; milk for $1.60, more than twice the
supemrarket’s 72 cents; and bulk Lucky
Charms for 50 cents per ounce, twice as
much as the packaged cereal. Even the
Ocean Spray juices cost $1.35, as opposed
to $1.09 at 7-Eleven. '

Spandonis explained that, due to the ,

limited, number of grocery items sold
through Sodexho, the company does not

receive the‘same discounts as supermar- _

kets or convenience stores.

Cafeteria account manager Michael
Gwiazdowski said the biggest reason for
the high prices is the high theft rate.

“When different salesmen shdw me
items, not only do Irconsider price, but I
think, ‘Can it ﬁt in someone’s pocket?’”
he said. “When we carried the Red Baron
Hotpockets last year, they actually- went’
directly into people’s pockets.”

Of the 200-units for sale the ﬁrst day,-
-30 were lost to theft, according to

Gwiazdowski. .
Spandonis said that one night last
semester, $400 worth of ice cream. was
stolen at one time. . ,
“You want to know what they did
with it?” she asked. “They didn’t _eat it;

V they left it in Forbes Quad.” Spandonis

said theft was a major reason the Oakland

Giant Eagle closed last year. _

All three ofﬁcials stressed the irnpor—
tance of student involvement in the ‘effort
to improve Pitt’s food services.

“We don’t just make a change

because. we feel like it,” "explained .

Spandonis. She and Gwiazdowski urged
students to bring any issues they have to
managers. Spandonis said the managers
are trained to listen to complaints.

“Students came to us and said they
wanted to have ice cream and pretzels at
Eddie’s late at night rather than Mexican
food,” said Gwiazdowski. “So‘that’s what
we gave them. Beginning this past
Monday, the pretzel and ice cream areas
have been open late.” _

Sallade-Farina said recent changes to
the Food Services status quo have come
straight from students. Beginning Oct. 25,

« the Pitt Club will be open to students and

their meal plans on Sunday nights. One
common complaint has been the fact that
C-Side Cafeteria ‘charges either one block
—-— equivalent to $4.65 — or -$6.50 in
Dining Dollars. ' '

The cafeteria now will charge all stu-
dents paying with meal plans "a ﬂat rate of
$4.65-. . ,

Sallade-Farina said many of these
changes are outlined in a mailing to be
sent this week The mailing will also
include a survey that can be ﬁlled out and
given anonymously to cashiers.
According to Sallade-Farina, the survey
was prompted by student complaints that
the Student Government Board didn’t rep-
resent them. '

As for the future, Sallade-Farina said
some people are happy with current
restricted meal_plans, and others are not.
She said that if enough people feel upper-
classmen should have unrestricted meal
plans, “that would deﬁnitely be something
to look into.” ‘

light allowing pedestrians to cross_

the street with all traffic stopped.
Darryl Phillips, the project
manager for traffic at Pittsburgh’s
Department of Engineering and
Construction, said that those

A options would not be as efficient as

narrowing the street.

“It is not feasible to stop traffic
for 30 seconds,” he said. “The
backup of traffic would be horren-
dousf’ ‘

Because traffic would have to
merge both in and out of this area,
some people showed concern that
there would be a bottlenecking
problem similar to conditions at the

Fort Pitt and Squirrel Hill tunnels,

according to Phillips. _

“We’re hoping this merge will
not be of the same order of magni-
tude,” Phillips said. “This is .why
we’re doing the study, so we can
understand all of the ramifica-
tions.” , L

Phillips said the city is also

_concerned it might interfere with

the present flow of traffic in
Oakland. «

Pitt freshman Tim Dixon said
that a. bridge over Fifth Avenue
would be his solution to the pedes-
trian situation. 0 .

“The street is too crowded,”
Dixon said. “And merging the traf-
fic into fewer lanes isjust going to
lead to more traffic accidents.”

Freshman Kelly Adams agreed
with Dixon that an overhead walk-
way is the solution.

“The intersection [Fifth Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard] is such .a
big traffic. intersection,” Adajns
said.’ “Between all of the cars and

buses, it is difficult ‘for, a student to
cross the street.”

are burying the dead. There is also a
Neanderthal dressed in typical present-day
street clothes, looking very human in his
jeans and ﬂarmel shirt.

The last diorama is of the Cro-
Magnons, dating 40,000 to 20,000 years
ago. They look completely human, and

’ they had an and religious concepts. They

are shown in a cave — some drawing pic-
tures on the walls and others making a ﬁre
and preparing a meal.

‘The art is absolutely beautiful. You
get to see their dreams and realities,” said
Apt.

Skipping to the present-day stage, an
overweight man sits in front of a television
with a remote control in his hand. His wife

sits next to him with curlers in her hair.

In addition to the dioramas, the exhibit
features many interactive displays, includ-
ing models of skulls that the visitor can
touch and compare, along with a strength
comparison for visitors to see the difference
in strength of a Neanderthal and modern
man. Other interactive exhibits include a
tool comparison, face cutouts in which vis-
itors can see their heads on the bodies of
human ancestors, a diet cabinet of what our
ancestors ate, and many others.

The exhibit also contains 32 panels of
scientific text and provides detailed infor-
mation to visitors.

The exhibit is located in what will now
be a “traveling” exhibit area.

“It’s part of a strategic planning process
to bring in blockbuster exhibits,” Apt said.
“It’s the beginning of many to come.”

Narrowing Fifth Avenue by
one lane is or pointless idea

The city of Pittsburgh is cur-
rently toying with the idea of
narrowing Fifth Avenue between
Belleﬁeld Avenue and McKee
Place, and is experimenting to
see whether this is viable. _

We can save the city all the
money it’s pouring into the
experiment: Narrowing Fifth

Avenue won’t solve any prob-.

lems; it’ll only compound them.
_ What possible advantages
could come from narrowing

‘ Fifth Avenue by extending the

sidewalk and converting one of
the car lanes into a bus lane?
The narrowing is supposed to
help reduce the number of peo-
ple being hit by vehicles on Fifth
Avenue. We can see how that’s
going to help: Trafﬁc will be at a
standstill because of the conges-

tion and the bottlenecking, so"

cars won’t be able to cause any
harm to pedestrians.

Pittsburghers can’t handle
bottlenecking even when it does-
n’t involve merging. Pittsburgh
drivers slow down when two
lanes outside of a tunnel contin-
ue as the same two lanes inside
the tunnel. Just because yinzer
drivers on Fifth Avenue will be
driving on a narrower road does-
n’t mean fewer yinzer pedestri-
ans will be hit. .

With the decrease in the
number of lanes, there will be
more cars per lane to potentially
hit students. It would be foolish
to assume that bynarrowing the
street students will save more
time crossing and will have less
chance of being hit by a vehicle.

Making the street narrower
does not necessarily mean that
the pedestrians will be any safer.
Where is the logic in assuming
that it would be? The bus lane
will still be the lane next to the
curb, next to the same railings,
and in a similar position in which
pedestrians could be hit by a bus.

Instead of spending all this
money ‘on proctoring a survey,
building more to the sidewalk,
adding trees, and reducing Fifth
Avenue by one lane, why not
build a railroad crossing gate at
every intersection warning
pedestrians that a bus is coming?

’Why doesn’t the University hire

some crossing guards to guide
students across the street? Why
doesn’t Pitt publish a comic
book detailing how to cross a
road? R .

Narrowing Fifth Avenue is a
dumb idea. The problems caused
by traffic will not be worth any
half—assed attempt to try to pro-
tect pedestrians.

Show me the fre crap!

Tuesday, as I wandered in from the body—lit-
tered streets of Oakland, I noticed the hullabaloo
in and around the Wrlliarn Pitt Union Ballroom

Irealized it was that crazy “@pglLcafe,” the
event whose name is so trendy, you just have to
go. So, though I have no interest whatsoever in
engineering, I decided to go. Also, they were giv-
ing away free mouse pads. ’

@pglLcafe is indeed a trendy idea. I visual- ,

ize a meeting in a gray room somewhere.
lVliddle—aged moneymen sit around an ergonom-
ic table in ergonomic chairs. One of the money-
men, sweating profusely (not because he’s large
— he just has big pores) armounces, “Fellas, we
need to catch the attention of the Generation
Xers of Pittsburgh What can we do?”

He turns to the committee’s sole youth, a
token boy among men, and says, “Billy, why
you’re in Generation X, right? What would get
your Generation X friends to come to a job fair?”

“Well,” says Bill, “that’s a
good question.” Deep in thought,
Bill turns his “Show Me the
Money” hat backward and crosses
his arms, his hands embedded ﬁrm-
lyinthe armpits of his “South Park”
T-shirt. Bill begins to jingle his Tommy Hilﬁger
key chain when suddenly, he looks up.

“OK, how about this: Kidslike coffee and
the Internet, right? We could put them together,
right?” he says, Surge spraying from his excited-
ly foaming mouth. “We could call it something
like java-dot-jobs, or something, right?”
(Writer’s note: Billy is based on actor-ﬁlrnmaker
Quentin Tarantino.) .

Well, whatever the bleakly commercial ori-
gin, .I stepped inside. I had just interviewed
someone for a story, so I was dressed slightly
more formally than usual. Though this event
advertised itself as informal, I was immediately
surrounded by skirts and shiny black shoes.

_ Students ran around, carrying information
about companies in need of bright young minds
to lead them into the 21st century. The well-
dressed business oﬁicials stood at tables carrying

Pretty normal for an engineering job fair, at
least Dilbert enthusiasts lined up at tables to
schmooze forthe ﬁrst time in their lives. They

battered their social lives.

You’d think money-ﬁlled, unfulﬁlling lives
would be draw enough to lure students to the
tables. Aha! That’s where you’re wrong, stupid-
head! Big, powerful multinational companies, in
order to infuse their ranks with new blood, need
to scatter such items as candy and st1ess—relief
balls across their tables. Candy? Stress balls?
What kind of image are these companies giving
the engineering students? “Ooh, baby, we want
you so bad we stopped at the drugstore an
bought you some lozenges.” ‘

something extraordinary. How about this: Sign
up for BMG, and get a free baby!

- “A baby would be great,” thinks the average
student. “I would love it and hug it and call it
George.” Students would stroll across campus,
book bags over one arm, babies under the other.
“Hey, look what I got,” says one roommate to
another. “They were just giving them away.”

‘Me too,” says the roommate.”I.et’s see if

Rather than the pagers and cellular phones
that people are now obligated to cany, babies

Nothing new in art of misinterpreting Bible

Michael J.

‘ “biblical

Mazza

In June of this year, U.S. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss),
while being interviewed by conservative
commentator Armstrong Williams,
declared that homosexuality was “sin-
ful”; the senator also compared homo-
sexuality to such disorders as alco-
holism and kleptomania. Lott’s contro-
versial remarks were defended by U.S.
House of Representatives Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R—Texas), who
declared that “he Bible is very clear on

this” and that both he and Lott “believe

very strongly in the Bible.”

Lott apparently couldn’t resist the‘,

temptation to engage in some more
gay—bashing” when he
addressed the Christian Coalition con-
ference held in Washington, D.C. on
Sept. 18 and 19. Reﬂecting on the criti-
cism his earlier remarks had inspired,
Lott declared, “The press said, ‘Geez,
what a backward thing. Where did Trent
Lott get such ideas?”’ Lott’s own
answer inspired wild applause from his
conservative Christian audience: “I tell
you where I got it. I got it from the
Bible.” - .

Unfortunately, Lott is not the only
politician to get such divisive ideas from
the Bible.

In May,1996, Alabama state Sen.

Charles Davidson distributed copies of a
speech to his colleagues in the state
Capitol. In the speech, which was pre-
pared in support of a proposal to resume
ﬂying the Confederate battle ﬂag atop
the Capitol, Davidson quoted Bible
verses such as Leviticus 25:44 and 1
Timothy 6:1 in order to prove that the
enslavement of people of African
descent was, in fact, God’s will.
Claiming that African—Americans were
better off under slavery than they are
today, Davidson wrote that those who
disagree with his thesis “are obviously
bitter and hateful against God and his
word, because they reject what God says
and embrace what mere humans say
concerning slavery.” T

The racist and homophobic methods
of biblical interpretation employed by
Lott, Anney Davidson are nothing
new in American history. In his 1676
history of a colonial war against Native
Americans, Puritan writer Increase
Mather looked to passages in the -books
of Joshua and Judges for precedents that
could justify the slaughter of indigenous
peoplesby God’s “chosen nation.”

In her book “The Woman’s Bible,”
19th century women’s rights activist
Elizabeth Cady Stanton noted that bibli-
cal passages such as Ephesians 5:22-24
and 1 Timothy 2:12-15 were used by
men in an attempt to intimidate "and
silence advocates of women’s suffrage.

Militant segregationists opposed the
civil rights movement of the 1950s and
‘60s with their readings of such pas-
sages as the 10th chapter of the book of
Ezra. And generations of American anti-
Sernites have justified their hatred of
Jews with New Testament passages such
as 1 Thessalonians 2:14-15. It seems
that anyone with a desire to abuse,
oppress, disenfranchise or destroy a
given community of people in America
has turned to the Bible for ammunition;
Lott is merely the most recent practi-
tioner of an old sport. -
The Judeo—Christian Bible is

large, multifaceted library of writings.
This collection was written by many dif-
ferent human authors over a vast span of
time. Yes, one can selectively pick a
handful of verses with which to justify
genocide, slavery, racial segregation,
disenfranchisement of women, violence

against gay people, and other evils. But .

if you choose different sets of verses,
you will ﬁnd a celebration of erotic love
(the Song of Solomon), a defense of the
humanity of foreigners,(the fourth’ chap-
ter of Jonah), a message of love and
acceptance toward a sexual minority
(the 8th chapter of Acts) and many other
ennobling and uplifting‘ ‘passages.
Which passages we choose to empha-
size reveals more about our own charac-
ter than it does about the Bible; this is a
message that Lott apparently never

learned in Sunday school. ‘A 

In his book “Deliver Us From Evil,”
Christian theologian James Newton

Poling notes, “Evil is a chameleon that '

maintains itself by remaining inter-
twined with the good and masking itself
as good.” All American Jews,
Christians, and others who cherish the
J udeo-Christian Bible as one of the most
inﬂuential texts in our collective intel-
lectual and spiritual heritage need to rec-
ognize evil when it seeks to intertwine
itself with selectively chosen biblical
passages that are divorced from their
full historical and literary context.
Unfortunately, those who have his-
torically used the Bible as a tool of ter-

-ror have been reluctant to surrender their

own fear, hatred and shame. Until we
can all conquer those inner demons, we
will never attain the “beloved communi-
ty” of which Dr. Martin Luther King

V prophesied during his campaign for civil

rights. Nevertheless, forward-thinking
Americans will continue to build up a
society in which every individual is val-
ued without regard to race, creed, gen-.
der or sexuality.

I respectively invite Lott to join in
the struggle.

Michael J. Mazza is a teaching fellow
and Ph.D. student in Pitt's department
of English, and he has taught the Bible
as Literature. — h

not   PM

Next weekend will be a special one
for college students and basketball fans
nationwide. In most places, the stroke
of midnight on Friday, Oct. 16 will
mark the real beginning of college bas-
ketball season. That moment is the first
NCAA—approved time slot to hold offi-
cial basketball practices. Instead of an
actual practice, most teams hold a sort
of preseason pep rally, affectionately
known as midnight madness. .

. It’s a shame that I need to explain
the idea. Unfortunately, it’s a foreign
concept at Pitt. For the third consecu-
tive year, midnight madness will not
take place here. V

We’ve heard the excuses. If’ we
have midnight madness, we can’t have
an effective practice at a reasonable
hour on Saturday morning. The team is
young. We can’t afford to miss any
practices.

Fans can believe that. The Panthers
have played in exactly two postseason
games in head coach Ralph Willard’s
four-year tenure here. That work still
needs to be done is apparent.

But as football‘ coach Walt Harris
would attest to, as much as a team may

exception of, say, beating Kentucky
(which the Panthers aren’t going to do
anytime soon, - no matter how much

they practice), the best way for a bas-
ketball team to turn otherwise normal

people into “ﬁeld-house fanatics” is
through midnight madness. _
Nowhere else, certainly not in
exhibition games against Marathon Oil,
do fans get to see all of the players in
action. At midnight madness, people

Jason Maile puts up _a'three—point shot.

the ball away, but Ruiz headed it back
toward the net. It bounced off the right
post and into the net.

Pitt keeper Nicole Bashor made an
impressive save on forward Abbie Burns
from just inside the left post. Jennifer

and interrupt the Dukes’ scoring. threats.

Duquesne had a chance to go up early
when Sarah Nicholson took advantage of
an errant clearing pass early in the 14th
minute but missed ‘wide on her kick.
Brigid Handforth created the only offen-

her shot blocked by Duke defenders.
Right before Ruiz’s goal in the ﬁrst half,

The Pittsburgh Panthers will battle the

Pitt. The Panthers play four road games this
year, and having already lost one of these at
Virginia Tech, they need to get a quality

Athlete Auction raises V
money for charity with dates

David Turner

Staff Writer

Tonight is a night for fan-
tasies to come true.

Tonight, you may be able to _
live out the secret dream of rnid—
dle—aged college graduates across
the country.

Tonight, you might just be
able to swing a date with a gen-
uine NCAA star. '

Tonight, though, may cost
you. p

The third annual Student
Athletic Trainers Association
Athlete Auction will be held this
evening at 8:30 pm in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom. It will offer
students the chance to buy a date
with a Pit athlete. -

Buy a date? Can that really

V exist in this day of political cor-

rectness?

“It sounds pretty cheap, but
it’s just a good way for athletes
and trainers to meet,” according
to junior Erin Compton, the pres-
ident of SATA.

It’s also a good way to raise
money. Students will have to out-
bid each other in order to receive
the romantic evening with the
athlete of their choice.

The proceeds will beneﬁt
both SATA, which will use the
money to pay for guest speakers,
and the Special Olympics.

Although Compton admits
that “it’s harder to get the girls to
do it,” each gender should be
well—represented. Members of the
football, basketball, swimming,
soccer, cross—country and the soft-

ball teams will offer their time for
the charity. '
Expected participants

include senior guard Vonteego

Cummings from the men’s bas-
ketball team and junior wide
receiver Kenney Ketchen from
the football team.

These two, along with about
35 others will “do the catwalk
thing” to the songs of their choice

in an attempt to raise the $10 min— _

imum bid.

Although the money is
important, the night is truly meant
for romance.

Once the bidding is done, it is
up to the the lucky winner and the
athlete to decide how and when to
spend their evening together. .

Admission will be free,
although SA'I‘A is requesting a $1

Carolina Tar Heels: a history lesson

Melissa Baran

Staff Writer

On Saturday, the Panthers
will be taking on a team with a
name very well known around
the country. Or is it? Does any
body. truly know what it means
to be a North Carolina Tar Heel?

Most people who know
UNC don’t realize that the tar
heel has a long history.

“There are many different
variations of the tar heel legend
that have been passed around
through the years,” said Steve
Kirschner, UNC’s director of
media relations.

The university was given
this name because North
Carolina is the Tar Heel State.

' “‘All of the other schools in
the state kind of resent the fact
we have this name because it is
our state’s nickname,” said
Kirschner. '

This dual-purpose nickname
has a varied history. The ﬁrst
legend dates as far back as the
Revolutionary War.

It was said that while in
North Carolina, British Gen.
Charles Cornwallis was crossing
what was known as the Tar River
between Rocky Mount and

Battleboro when he and his-

 

troops came upon tar that had
been dumped into the stream and
hindered their crossing. After
crossing they found their feet
completely blackened from the
tar.

From this scenario, it has
been thought that people who
wade in North Carolina rivers
will come out with tar on the bot-
tom of their heels. A

The second variation of the
tar heel legend dates back to a
Civil War skirmish in North
Carolina ‘

The Confederate column of
troops supporting the state was
driven from the ﬁeld. That set-
back left the North Carolinians
to battle it out alone.

This valiant effort sparked
Maj. Joseph Engleheard to
report Robert E. Lee as saying,
‘There they stand as if they have
tar on their heels.”

Kirschner said, ‘This [Civil
War] legend is the most widely
used when giving the tar heel
history.”

UNC established its mascot.

’ The North Carolina football
team had put together a stellar 9-
1 season in 1922. The driving
force of the team’s success that
year was a tough fullback named

It wasn’t until the 1920s that

Jack Menit, whose nickname
was “the battering ram.”

The next year, the university
tried to increase school spirit by
sponsoring a contest for the stu-
dents to choose a mascot.

The head cheerleader at the

time, VlC Huggins, came up with

the ram as a mascot in honor of
the stellar running back. Today,
fans can still see a ram being
walked across the ﬁeld during
football games.

North Carolina’s colors of
light. blue and white have a
unique history, as well.

Shortly after the Civil War,
most of the social activities at the
school were generated through
two literary societies, the
Dialectic and the Philanthropic,
which wore blue and white,
respectively. V Since it was
mandatory for all students to
belong to one of the "societies,
they all had to wear either blue
or white. As the years passed the
colors combined, the societies
disbanded, and light blue and
white became the ofﬁcial school
colors. ‘

When the Panthers travel
south this weekend, they will be
taking on a school whose popu-

lar‘ nickname has legendary ties

to American history.

of 44-23-15.

Furthermore, they continued to
dominate during the playoffs by
their second straight
Stanley Cup. With Steve Yzerman at
center and Chris Osgood in the
crease, the Red Wings look superior.

If there was one team that ques-

including Tom Fitzgerald, in hopes
of standing their ground in their
division. ,

The Colorado Avalanche quietly
roar in the Northwest Division.
Although the Avalanche are not the
same team they were two years ago
when they won their first Stanley
Cup in their first year in Colorado,
they are still a solid hockey club.

Patrick Roy, who seems to be a
fading name in the book of top NHL
goalies, may very well outdo him-
self this year. If he manages to keep
opponents to an average of two
goals per game, the Avalanche will
live up to their name once again.

Another team whose perfor-
mance is questionable this season

tioned A Detroit’s . might be ‘the
invincibility, it was V a n c o u v e r
the St. Louis Canucks.

Blues. Although Keeping in
finishing with mind that
fewer points than Vancouver relies
Detroit (45-29-8), on Pavel Bure,

the Blues did win

one more game
than the Red
Wings.

Maybe one of
the biggest factors
was and will be
Brett Hull, who led
all Blues scorers
with 72 points.
Understandably,
since Brett Hull
will play for the .
Dallas Stars this season, there will
be ‘more blues in St. Louis. Not only
will St. Louis miss its superstar, it
might miss its shot at the finals as
well. Fortunately, after arbitration,
the Blues managed to keep Pierre
Turgeon, who was second on the
team with 62 points, of which 22
were goals. A

The Blackhawks
impressive season, ending their
campaign with a weary 30-39-13
record. Desperately seeking size
and speed, Chicago signed free
agent Doug Gilmour, who played
with the Devils last season.

The Blackhawks, however,
might not be the most pushed-
around team in the Central Division
this year.

The Nashville Predators, an
expansion. team joining the NHL
this season, might find themselves
in over their heads with division
foes Detroit, St. Louis and Chicago.
The Predators selected David
Legwand with the second overall
pick in the 1998 entry draft and
signed numerous free agents,

 

had a less

.Mark Messier and
A l e x a n d e r
Mogilny, the
Canucks face high
expectations, but

achieve all that is
expected.

Can there be
a good team with-
out great‘goa1tend—
ing?
._ Edmonton Oilers
are hoping so.

After losing Curtis Joseph to
free agency this summer, the Oilers
will probably start Mikhail
Shtalenkov, who played with the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim last sea-
son.

Then there are’ the Calgary
Flames. With a disappointing 26-41-
15 record last year, Calgary will
only do better if it improve its goal-
tending as well as its special teams,
which lingered at the bottom of the
NHL last season.

The Pacific Division includes
teams such as the Mighty Ducks, the
Los Angeles Kings, the Phoenix
Coyotes, the Dallas Stars and the
San Jose Sharks. .

With the Dallas Stars now sport-
ing Hull at center, the fans might
have one more fact for their argu-
ments about the potential success of
the Stars this season.

Although the Los Angeles Kings
made a positive impression last sea-

son, the Stars will create a big wall .

for the Kings to overcome in order
to becomekings of their division.

care less about basketball, midnight
madness is a campus—wide party. Who
can resist that? And what kind of bas-
ketball team wouldn’t want a party cen-
tered around it?

This year is the perfect time to
bring midnight madness back to Pitt.
The Panthers are led by Vonteego
Cummings, who is regarded by some as

. one of the nation’s top 10 players. Why

not show him off? Let new fans know
who he is as soon as possible. That will
only generate more excitement among
fans once the season starts.

This year, Pitt would even have the
good fortune of being able to hold mid-
night madness over Homecoming
weekend. What better time to do it? In
fact, since the football team plays the
lowly Scarlet Knights of Rutgers, n1id—
night madness could very well be the
most exciting event of Homecoming
weekend. Instead, the most exciting
thing anyone at Pitt will see is Dick
Vitale’s face on ESPN, broadcasting
from somebody else’s party.

Geoﬂ Moak is a columnist for The Pitt.

News. Whether midnight madness hap-
pens or not, he’s going to be mad at
midnight next Saturday.

UNC

26 receptions and 498 yards, along with
seven touchdowns. Grim is the Big East
leader in receiving yards per game (122.2)
and receptions per game (6.5).

The Panther offensive line settled down
last week against Akron, only allowing two
sacks on quarterback Matt Lytle. Lytle
showed what he can do when he has pro-
tection, as he completed 12 of 17 passes for
208 yards. Lytle is ranked 18th in the ‘nation
in passing eﬂiciency.

Pitt’s rushing attack also has been pro-
ductive this year. Sophomore Kevan
Barlow leads the team with 203 yards rush-
ing, while freshman Brandon Wﬂliarns isn’t
far behind with 157.

North Carolina turned to defensive
coordinator Carl Torbush after head coach

‘ Mack Brown left for the University of

Texas. Well, at least the defense will stay
good, right? Wrong. After four games, l'.l'lC
Tar Heel defense is ranked 65th in the coun-
try overall and 94th against the pass. All of
this is happening with comerback Dre Bly
in the defensive backﬁeld Bly was men-

tioned as a possible Heisman Trophy candi-

date in the preseason,_ but those hopes are

gone. UNC had the top—ranked scoring
defense last season, but this year it is ranked
75th.

— The Pitt defense has been the talk of the
campus all week. With their outstanding
performance against Akron, the Panthers
are now ranked 10th in total defense in the
counuy. The outstanding secondary, led by
comerback Hank Poteat, has made Pitt’s
defense No. 7 in the nation against the pass.
Phil Clarke, at Butkus Award candidate,
leads the Panthers with 36 tackles on the
year. Poteat’s three picks are tops on the
team, and safety Seth Homack follows with
two intercepted passes.

This is the ﬁfth meeting in history
between the two schools, and each team has
won twice. The last meeting was in 1982.
when the No. 16 Panthers beat the No. 5 Tar
Heels by a 7-6 score in Foge Fazio’s debut
as Pitt’s head coach. Saturday’s meeting is
important for the Tar Heels if they are to sal-
vage anything from this season. The
Panthers, meanwhile, have their eyes on the
postseason, and a win at Chapel Hill could
go a long way toward determining that.
