An extended debate by Board
members on a possible solution to
the problem .of objects being
thrown from the Towers windows
followed the opening prelimin-
aries at the Student Government
Board meeting on Thursday night.

SG President Tom Bailey re-
ported that he had a meeting with
John Vrana, Housing director.
who had asked Bailey to see if the
SG Board could arrive at a tenta-
tive solution.

The problem arose when four

'_ lawsuits were filed against the

University for personal damage
done by objects thrown from the
dorm windows. Vrana suggested
that all Towers windows would be
sealed unless a better alternative
was presented. The Board sug-
gested the possibility of putting
screens on all the windows and of
giving a strict warning to all dorm
residents.

Board member Bob Stack stated

' that the decision should not be left

in the hands of the SG and suggest-

ed that the Men's Dorm Council
should take care of it. The discus-
sion ended with no consensus.

A proposal was made that an un-
dergraduate member be put on
the Board of Trustees. Bailey felt
that the member should be part of
SG but the Board agreed that he
need not be a Board member. No
vote was taken on this issue.

The Board then voted to accept
andrecommend that Nathan Da-
vis attend the Allocations Board
meeting on Tuesday to request
emergency funding for the Jazz
Seminar which is to be held Oct.
18-20.

A motion was passed unani-
mously to support the Miami Uni-
versity Higher Education Encour-
agement Act of 1972. This is a rec-
ommendation to the U.S. Con-
gress to allow the deductability of
tuition fees up to the amount of
$500 in any tax year, applicable to
the Federal Personal Income Tax.

The Board felt that if such an
act became law it would provide
obvious financial assistance to_

university students and their par-
ents. ‘

Board member Dave Bluey
brought to discussion the necessi-
ty of Programming Board Chair-
man Bob Immanuel using an
agent for obtaining groups for
concerts.

Immanuel is currently using a
booking agent for obtaining most

of the groups that,give concerts"

at the University. Bailey felt that
an agent was not needed to book
any groups on campus because
of the 10 per cent agent’s fee.-but
Bluey stressed the difficulty of
getting in contact. with the more

popular groups. A motion was -

passed that the Programming
Board could use an agent only for
big name concerts.

Fourteen more campus organ-
izations were allocated office
space by the Board. Those organ-
izations include IFC Pan-Hel. Pitt
International Relations Club. As-
sociation for Computing Machin-
ery. PIRG. Undergraduate Wom-
en's Union and Associated Wom-

en's Union. Unicycle Club. Karate
Club. Hockey Club, Ski Club. Bai-
hi, and the Pitt Christian Fellow-
ship. The Undergraduate Academ—_
ic Review which has been sharing
an office was allotted an office to
themselves.

_ In other business the Board
passed a motion to fund $559.25 to
Pitt International Student Organ-
ization for Cultural Affairs. The
Women's Housing Board request-
ed funding for a Germaine Greer-
Norman Mailer debate, and a mo-
tion was passed and recommend-
ed that a request for emergency
allocations be put in at the next
Student Allocations meeting. SDS
and Orchesis allocations .were
passed without discussion.

The need for a‘ programming
commission was discussed by the
Board members and a representa-
tive from Student Affairs. It was

The final item of business

considered was an unprecedent- _ 
ed request for official SG censure '-

of a professor. Charles Schlotter,

a representative from Kappa Kap-; ,:
pa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma, the,"
honorary band fraternity and sor- ‘
’ ority. asked the Board ‘to take ac-
tion against Dr. Robert Snow... 

chairman of the Music Depart-
ment. -

Schlotter charged that Dr. Snow"

has been openly harassing Kappa‘ ‘T
Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma by ‘ j .
interfering with their mail serv; .

ice and changing the locks of their

office in the band room. Scholtter . .
claimed that ‘these organizations _

and the Pitt Band were insepar-
able and that their requests to the
Provost to take action against
Snow went unheeded.

The Board was unanimous in

agreeing not to take any action ‘

 

generally felt that such a com-
mission is needed to calendar
events so that the events would be
continuous throughout the term.
The matter was tabled with no ac-
tion taken. ~ - -

until they had investigated‘ bot ‘
sides of the conflict. - ‘

As Board member Terry Sadler
put it. “I never did like a one-sided
story.” ‘ t

Rights and Responsibilities Code

Awaits Pos\’ar’s, Trustees’ Okay

by JIM HOSEK

A new Rights and Responsibil-
ities Code, and Student Judiciary
System for Pitt students on the
Oakland campus is in the making.

A meeting of the Joint Commit-
tee on Rights and Responsibili-
ties, held last Friday. met to iron
out problems in the drafting of the
new students’ rightspackage.

The committee approved the
new Code, and it now must be’
signed by the Board of Trustees
and Chancellor Posvar before it
will go into effect.

One of the major differences
between the Code being drafted
and the one now in effect is that

—Pitt students will be able, under

the_new Code. to request to see
their personal file.

Permission to see one‘s file is
presently a rarity because of the
red tape involved.

An outstanding problem that
was presented at the meeting was
whether the Code would affect all
University students (at all cam-
puses) or only the Oakland cam-
pus where it was being drafted.
There was a desire by the com-
mittee for the Code to be uniform
for all campuses, but it was de-
termined that each campus is re-

ALDEN EARL BOWEN"

sponsible for the students only at
that location. The Code, therefore,

_ would only befor the Oakland

campus. '

One problem which was not
solved in the new Code. it was re-
vealed, was the case of any Pitt
student committing a crime off-
campus. Some members of the
committee thought that the stu-
dent should be held responsible

()n l*‘(>rl)cs and Fifrli .\\s'cs‘.

for his actions to the University
since he is a student violating the
Code. Others, however. said that
the University’s domain ends at
its physical boundaries.

Another possible "loophole."
which was found in the proposed
Code was the selection process of
the five-member hearing panel of

.of the Campus Judiciary Board

(CJB ). It was questioned whether
selection should be done by
means of a lottery or by the dis-
cretion of the coordinator of the
University Student Judiciary. Al-
den Ear Bowen.

Bowen explained that it was‘

necessary for him to choose the

members of the hearing since “it '

is oftentimes very difficult to.-.fini,1-
people who are available.”

The Code. if approved by the
Board of Trustees. will follow his
suggestions.

LEADERS are needed to help
“Y’s link” groups of kids work
toward a Washington, D. C.,
trip. Activities are designed to
C be fun and enriching while
they help lead to the trip goal.

Experiment Reroutes Traffic

by JOYCE BENSON

Fifth Ave. will be one way in-
bound and Forbes Ave. one way
outbound for a two month traffic
experiment. starting Sunday. June
18. according to the Department
of City_Planning.

The boundaries will include the
County Jail downtown and Belle-
field Ave. in Oakland. A

Parking on both streets will be-

  

permitted if no problems arise.

A25 mile per hour speed limit
will be enforced. City Police will
aid confused motorists f'or
first two weeks of the experiment.
After that “they’ll be on their
own“ a city official said.

Port Authority Transit will be
changing some of their bus routes.

The Department of City Plan-
ning is hoping that the new traffic

   

the 

 

pattern will relieve congested
rush hour traffic along Fifth and
Forbes Aves.

If the two month experiment is
successful the plan will go before
the City Council for approval be-
fore the changes become perma-
nent.

If the experiment fails the de-
widen

partment is - planning to

I/Itiversity To Pay City
_.F or Mlmiciprtl Seriviceégii

by MICHELLE PILECKI _
The University has agreed to pay the City of Pittsburgh about $60,-
000 a year for municipal services provided to the buildings to be con-
structed in the Forbes Field area.

That amount was set in a resolution passed by the City Planning A
Commission and approved by the University's executive committee of
the Board of Trustees. The payment is subject to “annual adjustment
in proportion to the percentage increase or decrease in the City of

Pittsburgh's approved operating budget for that year.“ according to the. I

wording of the resolution.

The Trustees have pointed out that the payment is only for munici-
pal services, such as street maintenance and fire an_d policeprotection ‘
and is to have no effect on the University7s tax-exempt status-

The agreement between the University and the city was the green
light needed for development of Forbes Field, which Pitt acquired
in 1959. Bernard J. Kobosky. Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs, des-

cribed the Forbes area development as “catch-up projects, designed , I

to modernize facilities. consolidate presently dispersed programs, to"
relieve serious overcrowding. and to release rented space.” Plans are
for a new Law Building, a Professional Quadrangle Building, and an
addition to Lawrence Hall. —

To underline the need f'or the new buildings, Kobosky noted that the _'
School of Education “is scattered over.15 different locations, including .

rented facilities in Oakland.“- He added that the School of Law is spread

over three different floors of the Cathedral of Learning. “Unless there

is some hope of providing adequate facilities for the school, its accredi- 

tation could be in jeopardy at a time when the demand for legal educa-' '
tion in this region far exceeds our capacity to provide it,” he stressed.

Presently, the University pays more than $300,000 a year for¢rent-
ed space, Kobosky said. He added, “With the availability of these new
facilities, we will be able to retract from many of these sites into our
proper campus boundaries.”

, Kobosky recalled that. since 1965, whenthe University became '
state-related, enrollment has increased by more than 50 per cent. The

vice chancellor added. “We do not anticipate any such similar growth V’ '
‘in the future..We have been advised by that state that, in terms of both. 
buildings and operational support, we should stabilize our enrollment. 
_ with the exception of relatively small increasesin the size of, certain

professional schools where the Commonwealth is suffering critical V. ,

shortages.“ e V

Hunt V. Matin, director of the physical plant, described the three
projects for the Forbes Field area. The School of Law Building, a six
story structure, will be bounded by Forbes Ave., Bouquet St., Sennott
St. and Lawrence Hall. The building will house a student lounge, activ-
ity facilities, a library for the law school, office, ‘a Moot Court, and sev-
eral classrooms and seminar rooms.

Landscaping will surround the building and will include trees and /-
bushes. To relieve pedestrian traffic over Forbes Ave., a bridge will .
be constructed connecting the Towers and the new Law School.

The Professional Quadrangle Building, located on the Forbes
Field site, adjacent to Sennot St., will house education and social sci-
ences. Martin noted that the building is to include two stories of park-
ing beneath a plaza, and six stories of building above the plaza. The
building will contain offices, seminar rooms, classrooms, learning
resource spaces, and other academic facilities, as well as a bridge
over Sennott St. Martin noted that plans relating to traffic flow, land- ‘

scaping, and "some other matters having to do withystreets," will‘ ‘

be deferred.

The third part of the project is an addition to David Lawrence Hall,
to provide space for the media operations of the University. The addi-
tion will also include connections to the ‘Quadrangle Building and Hill-
man Library. , ‘

Kobosky noted that there are no present plans for more construc-

_ tion after the Forbes Field Development is completed. He added that V _
any more expanion in this century would be,,_on land already owned by _: _
‘the University, saying,“‘I can’t imagine the',~U’niversity expanding fur- g . .

ther to the point of needing condemnation.” _

 

   
 
  

    
   
   
  
   
  
   
 
  
    
   
     
     
   
  
   
  
  
  
   
   
    

Afew years ago while working
in the theatre, I was frequently
-.«in‘ the company of a number of
gentlemen who to this day remain
fine critics. Early in my exper-
iences I noted that they only rare-
ly sat through an entire perform-
-"ance. I later learned that not only
- were they busy men, in some in-
_stances , they were justified in
~ ‘leaving plays before the ‘final cur-
tain,‘ for agony need not be a part
‘_ of a critics job——at least if it can

had passed the feeling was un-
mistakable. All who read me to-
day, must therefore, seek out a
braver soul to relate the ending,
masochism is not yet part of my
nature.

The only remarkable point about
Haven is that it is very poor the-

rector or cast, for even though
some of the dialogue is sprite and
witty, the play has little sub-

_stance.

Just as a good book may be des-
cribed as being ‘well written, so

‘ too, a play can be judged by the
same criteria. John Arden’s least"

admirable contribution to the the-

as a one act play. If so, perhaps
it may have survived.

Arden’s plot concerns the aged
and their rejuvination to youth
through the efforts of a ‘scientist
with a secret potient. He prob-
ably makes some social com-
ments about the old' and their
plight. One may also see some
points here and there in the irony
of it all, but since he choose
agonizing steps as his form.of de-
velopment ‘instead of concrete
stages of writing’, his work be-
comes a series of tedious agoniz-
ing moments.

found my sweet freedom.

During my trial with the show
there were moments that I shall
not forget. The most pleasure
was gained from Kathy Devecka’s
portrayal of Mrs. Phincus. She
developed ‘a delicate and well ex-
ecuted character. Her voice and
movements were specific, and
her crips rendition of the delight-
ful spinster left me quite pleased.

Tom Spinella once again wins
raves. His characterization of

.Mr. Crape was excellent,‘-and ac-

cordingly he continues his repu-
tation as a well balanced and ver-
satile actor.

Kick Knowle’s (Robinson) ex-
pressiveness of face and body
gave some brighter moments to
the duller ones. Wayne Claeren
(Dr.) developed late but in pol-
ished form. Irwin Moskowitz (Mr.
Golightly) was well oiled but with-

out much reality. Ken’ Wampler.

(Mr. Hardrader) gave a interest-
ing portrayal, doing the best he
could with some awkward dia-
logue. /

support were Paula Stwart, Ran-

New furniture has been pur-
chased for the Tower’s main lob-
by reported Student Government
President Tom Bailey at the June
8 meeting.

“Twenty-five tables and 40 sep-
arate chairs, blue and gold in col-
or were bought for the cafeteria
in Tower B,” Bailey said.

After putting furniture in the
Towers lobby, they will be sealed
in glass so that the furniture can-
not be removed.

Seating will be purchased and
glass enclosures erected for all
main lobbies. Also included in the
plan is new furniture and enclos-
ures for all Tower floor lobbies.

Student Government and Men’s
Dormitory Council purchased the
furniture and hope to have the
lobbbies completed by fall.

Since the end of Spring football drills I have
been assured by a number of nonbelieving football
. fans——not ordinary football fans, but football fans
 that are close to the Pitt picture—that the wishbone
 would be a short lived football experiment.

Despite head coach Carl DePasqua’s unmistak-
able commitment to the. wishbone these skeptics
have insisted on their point.

F
2‘-

“The wishbone is a sound football formation for -

. the people we’ve got," reassured

}_ assistant football coach Paul

- Kemp. “It’s all we’ve been spend-
ing time on right now. It’s not the '
only formation we are going to
use, there’s no guarantee it is go-
ing to work, but I think we are

 commited to the full house back-
field.

Assuming, however, that the
wishbone turns out to be a total
flop in the early games next year,
there is the possibility of some sort of change. But,
abandonment of the wishbone would mean wasted
spring and summer practice sessions.

‘It is likely that thegcoaching, staff would re-
ceive more criticism if they chose to "forget the
wishbone than if they kept it regardless of the out-
come.

Kemp: Wishbone Is

For the next year at least, the wishbone is for
real and here for the duration.

Football recruiting dipped _into a lot of prep
schools and a community college for next years in-
coming talent.

Does this mean that a few of these athletes have
a chance to break into Pitt football right away?

“I can’t foresee and would be surprised if any
of the recruits start right away,” said Kemp. “Col-
“College football is a different league. I foresee
some of them traveling and playing with the varsity,
but not starting all of a sudden. '

* * *

It was just last season that DePasqua mention-
ed how nice it would be for a head coach of a big_time
football school to have a new office. Any-
one who caught a. glimpse of Carl’s office
couldn’t very much blamehim for men-
tioning it.

Well, DePasqua didn’t get a new of-
fice, but his old office is being remodeled
and will be ready for the fall season.

team to beat for the IM softball
title is wining again. More impor-
tant though is the manner in which
they have defeated their last three
opponents. '

Three games/Cago the Browns

' handily defeated the Med Men by

a 9-0 score. Then they followed
that victory by crushing the Pitt
Dents, 12-2. And then, in their last

game they defeated Sociology by
the modest score of 38—0—gaining

revenge for an earlier loss to So—'

ciology, 5-2.

That totals to 59 scored runs.
while allowing only two to the op-
position. Opposing teams should
drool at those figures.

Meanwhile, the Spring Term-
ers, a league originally scheduled

to play in the Spring was suppos-
ed to be rapped up this week.
However, all of the teams have
decided to remain for the rest of
the summer. Phi Lambda Phi and
Big Swing seemed headed for the
championship game—in a playoff
