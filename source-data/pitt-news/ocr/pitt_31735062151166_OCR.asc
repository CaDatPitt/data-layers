McCahill, Ryan Will Lead
College Spring Dance
At Hotel Schenley

 

"If you want to meet in per-
son the boys who won the bas-
ketball championship for Pitt,
come to the College Association
Spring Informal tonight,” says
Leo Ryan, ’37, social chairman and
leader of the dance. “We’ll have the
entire squad as guests of honor.”

“Yes,” adds Mary Ellen McCahill,
’-10, who will be Ryans leading lady
for the evening; “and don’t forget to
tell them that Len l\rIaIi1vern’s smooth
Society Club Orchestra will play
from 9 to 1—in the main ballroom
of the Schenley.”

With such effective drawing cards,
the dance should be a big success.
It’s the ﬁrst post-Lenten dance, the.
real beginning of the spring society
season, an-d the last low-pric-ed affair
of the year.

“But it's. strictly informal,” says
Ryan. “All you need is a girl and a
dollar.”

Spring ﬁnery in the latest styles
will make the evening the most color-
ful since the Easter Parade.

Tickets may be purchased until ﬁve
o’clock this afternoon, from any mem-
ber of the CA Cabinet or ticket com-
mittee; from the College office, Room
204, State Hall; the dean of men’s
office, Room 801, Cathedral; and the
evening session office, second floor,
Cathedral.

Members of the Cabinet are: Ryan;
Charles R. Rogers, ’37; John Michel-
osen, '38; Rose Nugent, ’38; Ann
Whippo, ’39; Charlotte Atwell, ’37;
Jack Kotler, ’39; Verna Douglass,

April Election Candidates
Must Obtain Signatures
By Next Tuesday 0

Petitions for the nomination for
‘the vacancies in Men’s Council which
will arise when four senior members
are graduated may be obtained in
Room 801, Cathedral, announces Flor-
ian Majchrzak, E37, president.

A week from Tuesday, the dead-
line (late for submission of petitions,
the four senior members of the Coun-
cil are to meet with Robert Corley,
assistant dean of men, to select the
36 candidates whose names will be
placed before University men at the
April 23 general elections.

At last year’s election when the
first 13 members to Men’s Council
were elected, a slip occurred and
women voters were also handed bal-
lots. This will not happen at the April
23 elections, said Majchrzak.

Of the 13 members of Men’s Coun-
cil, six are from the College, three
from the School 01' Business Admin-
istration, two from Engineering, and
one each from Mines and Education.
The number of representatives is
determined by assigning one for each
200 men students in the school.

Sophomores as well as seniors and ‘

juniors in the College and School of
Business Administration are eligible
for positions, but in the other schools
only seniors and juniors are repre-
sented. A 1.0 average is required of
all candidates.

History Professor Outlines
System. For Passing Exams

Examination Time Should Be Vacation, Dr. Geisc Says;
Tells Personal Anecdote To Show Study Value

By Alvin Malakoff

“Examination time should Be the
student's vacation time,” says Dr. J.
J. Geisc, assistant ‘professor of his-
tory. “Only the teacher should have
to work during an examination; the
student should know the answers to
the questions before he comes into
class."

No, the good professor is not ad-
vocating an Utopia. He has a sim-
ple plan that he has used, which will
absolutely give you the type of test,
the material needed for the answers,
a._n_,d‘,even the exact questions them-
selves. '  '
“All you have to do is to follow a
few simple rules. In the first place,
there are three types V of. materials
that a student will get during any
semester’s study. The facts he gets
from the text, from outside reading,
and from lecture notes comprise the
first group of .materials. _Then there
are those ; derived from logical
thought, from considering different
points of view, and from noticing the
instructor's idiosyncrasies.

This last about the instructor's

I

temperamental points is quite impor-
tant, because it will tell you whether
he will go to the trouble of making
and correcting an essay type; whether _
he takes off double for a wrong ‘true-
false answer; or just how hard his

ll-F Ball Chairman
Doesnit Need Publicity

Intcrfrnternity llnll cliaiirman
Ben W. Baskin, C37, is in a pecu-
liar poi"-.=ition today. Getting pub-
licity for his dance is an impor-
tant part of any chairn1an’s job,
but now Ben’s -dance doesn't need
any publicity.

Chief reason behind Ben’s loss

multiple choice questions will be.

The third way of getting material
about a. subject is for the student to
consider his own powers of memory
and recall. Then, with all this mate-
rial, spend some time every week an-'
alyzing it, and getting a good grasp
on new additions to the stock of
knowledge. E

If the studeiif. does tlris. he should
at any time during the semester, be
able to know the material, even the
questions tlicniscllvcs, that will allow,
him’ ‘to answer any test with little,
trouble, and with good re.sults. 3

Dr. Geise remembers the tinie he’
was taking a. post-giacluatze course at;
Columbia. He guessed and prepared.
the’ answers to a ﬁnal exam so v:ell,l
that a fellow-student was able to!
make an A.

The moral is: all you've got to do
is study and you'll pass any exam.

of interest in further I-F Ball pub-
licity is the fact that all of the 550
four-dollar tickets to the dance.
have been sold. Of course, it is pos-
sible that one or two. of the 30
ticket reservation.~: oil’e1'ed for sale
yesterday in the dean of men’s of-
ﬁce may have been overlooked, but
the man on campus who can get
one ‘r.erl:iy for two dollars, tho. es-
tabli-..hed price. is a magician, ac-
cording to Ba;-skin.

All I-F Ball ticket reservations
niay be exi.-.ha_11g'ed for t.icket:<, for
an adrlitional two dollars, on Mon-
day. Tue.-;day. and Weclnestlay of

Research Staff, Scientists
Will Lead Ceremonies;
To Last Five Days

By Oscar Goodstein

The new building of Mellon
Institute at Fifth a11d Belleﬁeld
Avenues will be dedicated May
5-9, with famed scientists and
industrial leaders from all parts
of the world attending its formal
opening.

Appearing before a meeting of the
Institnte’s research staff, Director
Edward R. Weidlein gave this first
word as to plans for the new build-
ing‘s opening. The new structure, oc-
cupying much of a city block, has
been under construction for six years.
It replaces the building on the Uni-
versity campus, which has been the
.l11siitu'te’s home for the past 22 years,
and will be dedicated in appreciation

of its founders, Andrew W. Mellon
and Richard B. Mellon.

Open for Inspection

The dedication ceremonies will oc-
cupy ﬁve complete days, from Wed-
nesday, May 5, to Sunday, May 9, in-
elusive. On two of these days, as yet
unannounced, the building will be
open for public inspection and the
whole period will be filled with a suc-
cession of public meetings, assemblies
and banquets. Several Nobel Prize
winners in the ﬁelds of science and
industry have been contacted to speak
rat these meetings.

Since the founding of the Institute
in 1911, a long list of successful re-
searches have been carried out; 33
fellowships have been in operation for
ﬂve years or more. Beginning as it
did on a modest scale, the Institute’s
industrial fellowship procedure has to
date served 3,600 companies, individ-
ually or as members of industrial as-
sociations. About 650 novel processes
and products have been invented or
developed by Fellows of the Institute.
In ten instances, fellowship inven-
tions have created new industries, and
through many of their accomplish-
ments, new branches have been added
to existing manufactures in a wide
ﬁeld of chemical technology. Some of
its researches have dealt with smoke
abatement, industrial and urban dusts
and their resultant diseases, dental
caries, sleep, and pneumonia. Re-
searches now being carried on range

Professor Li Tells ‘Peace
Club That United States
Must Stay Neutral

BROADCAST SLATED

By John Martinco
Calling for American stu-

 

~-dents to join with Chinese:_
youth to preserve peace by

"Never killing men as did our
fa.thers,” Professor L1, Chinese
educator, yesterday advised an.aud1-
ence of 50 University students at the
Y club rooms. . .

Speaking at a joint meeting of
the Pitt Peace Council and the Thurs-
day Freshman Club on the subject,
“Can China Win Japan Over?” Mr.
Li appeared as one of the group of

"speakers representing the country-

wide Emergency Peace -Campaign,
devoted to the interests of world
peace.

Mr. Li declared that, “Japan is the
greatest hindrance to the progress of
China.” He exclaimed that the Jap-
anese have obstructed Chinese prog-
ress not only by militaristic and po-
litical aggression, but also by means
of forces making for moral and so-
cial disintegration.

As one striking example of the lat-
ter point, he charged that a vital tool
employed by the Japanese in their
imperialistic program in China is the
weakening of the physical and moral
‘character of Chinese youth by the in-'
troduction of the drug, heroin. Stu-
dents, he alleged, are introduced to
the habit-forming drug deliberately
by the Nipponese agents to lessen
their resistance to Japanese invasion.

Despite the fact that there is some
sentiment in China for war against
Japan, Professor Li declared that in
recent years there has arisen a great
movement in the interest of peace in
that country. This, he declared, was
one of the results of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai Shek’s policy for the uni-
ﬁcation of China; a- policy which is
receiving ever-increasing support
among Chiang’s countrymen.

Deploring war in general as. a de-
stroyer of culture that is the resul't
of centuries of civilization, the speak-
er declared that in case of war,
Americans should make every effort
to remain neutral, in order that they
might preserve the last remaining
center of culture in the world.

Mr. Li was introduced by Egbert_

Hayes, regional director of the Emer-
gency Peace Campaign. Announce-
ment was made of a broadcast sched-
uled for Tuesday evening over the
blue network of NBC, to begin at
10:30 o’clock. The program will
launch EPC’s plan, “No Foreign War
Crusades,” with speeches by Eleanor
Roosevelt, Rear Admiral Richard
E. Byrd, and Harry Emerson Fosdick.

Business Bureau
R ep o rts Marked
Employment Rise

Smashing all records for more than
six years, employment in the Pitts-
burgh district rose to 94.1 percent in
February, the Bureau of Business Re-
search reports.

In addition, combined payrolls of all
ﬁrms increased 1.4 percent during the
month, even though there was one
more working day in January for
many lines of business.

Payrolls for the first two months of
1937 were 43.3 ‘percent ahead of the
same period last year. Yet living costs
of" workers averaged less than 3 per-
cent higher during the two months.

Factory employment is above the
level of the 1929 boom at present, ac-
cording to the Bureau’s report. With
100 as the 1929 average, jobs in the
factories stand at 101.6.

Heavy’ industries, however, were
not the only beneﬁciaries of the new
upswing. Banks led the non-manufac-
turing groups in new employment
with a 3.7 per cent rise, wi'th all bus-
inesses reporting gains in employ-
ment.

in their scope from dairy technology
to cosmetics.

The building itself possesses strik-
ing beauty and is at the same time
an example of unusual architecture. It
is built down into the ground so that
its nine stories seem‘ like only ﬁve.
Although the three lower floors are
below ground level, deeply excavated
interior courts provide ample day-
light. Outwardly it is an authentic
translation of classical Grecian archi-
tecture, inwardly a. modernly treated
grouping of very well equipped re-
search laboratories.

Monolithic Columns

According to Dr. Weidlein, there is
an unusual story behind the stately
Ionic columns of the exterior struc-
ture. “The columns,” states Dr. Weid-
lein. “were to be single units; they
were not to be built up block by
block as segments, with horizontal
lines where the pieces ﬁtted together
destroying the’ long symmetry of the
60111111118’ lines. but were to be whole
columns fashioned out of huge pieces
of limestone. But there were more
problems involved. To carve out of a.
slab of granite weighing 125 tons a
final column weighing 60 tons, and
then to handle that so ﬂawlessly that
the column is undamaged, the streets
over which it passes a.re not broken
by its weight, the building is ‘not
damaged as it is raised into position
and" the _workmen are not hurt, is
really a modern building feat.” Yet
with all these difficulties the columns

 

corned should be present.

history has marked the Women’s As-

by Mrs. Samuel Black McCormick, is
onejof _the largest and most active of
faculty women’s groups in American
colleges.  .- '* _ '

60 new members to its rolls through

Activities have included more than;

50 meetings and events of various
kinds sponsored by the association as
a whole or by the various groups and
divisions. In addition, there have been
seven general meetings at which 13
speakers and a nu-mber of musicians
rave been heard.

A new activity this year has‘ been
the social service group which, under
the direction of Mrs. Verne C. Wright,
has had leaders in social work lec-
ture to the members, and has con-
tributed sewing to the Magee hospital.
Other work of the group included
canvassing for the Community Fund,
collecting articles for the Workshop
for the Blind, selling Christmas seals,
and assisting. with the children’s serv-
ice bureau.

Another association project was the
establishment of a perpetuating book
shelf in the University library. The
book exchange and drama group is
headed by Mrs. J. Stewart Hunter.

Two other club projects, the verse‘
speaking choir and the mixed choral.‘

directedby Miss Helen Irwin and
Mrs. C. Stanton Belfour, have cre-
ated considerable interest during the
year. '

number of beneﬁts, has been in-
creased through the efforts of _Mrs. H.
S. Coleman and her committee; and
a marked increase in the new club-
room fund has been made during the

An independent survey was made recently
among professional . men and women-lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more ¥than.87% stated they

personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Sullavan veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That's why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
"It's Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.

Mud slinging

HREE THOUSAND MILES of back {once
and two women of the tubs throw mud balls at
each other’s white-wash! Of course they’rc verbal

-mud balls, but whether or not they splatter out on

Hitler's nice clean brown shirt or on LaGuardia’s
Manhattan affair, they’rc bound to supply some
discomfort to the parties concerned.

A few soiled shirts could, of course, be relaun-
dered, but the bad part of the whole affair is the
splashes that are sure to glance off innocent by-
standcrs.

The choice name calling by the N cw Yorker has
not added any oil to stormy foreign waters that
the United States Government must navigate. Not
that Mayor LaGuardia's dislike is hard to under-
stand. _

But he is, as Secretary of State I-lull indicated in
his apologies to Germany, a public official. And he
should consider the result of his actions in that
li ht.

gPctty bickering and name-calling of this sort are
the stuff of which international hatreds are made.
They not only wound the pride of the two parties
concerned, they also make the people of both
countries feel that their national pride has been
trampled. _ _

It is this feeling that helps to make wars.

For the present this barrage of invectives seems
to have been halted, but it will not be forgotten.
Another spark, another ﬂame, and the whole mass
of mud will be thrown again, and the next time
more people will be throwing it.

Political Whirl

  By William Stark

FEW WEEKS AGO, this column pointed out that if

the Supreme Court acted favorably upon certain of
President Roosevelt's favorite measures, the hue .-and cry
raised in regard to his proposal to change the Supreme
Court would be toned down. Although the verbal showers
seem to have been abated, fundamentally the lines of
conflict have been drawn more sharply.

The defenders of the status quo have become more
staunch defenders, while the proponents of the Presi-
dcnt’s measure, seemingly so numerous, have attempted
to modify the proposal by proposing a fluctuating mem-
bcrship—-between nine and 15——-or proposing to institute
changes in all Federal Courts except the Supreme Court.

The toning down has come from the Democratic ranks,
as some of our Congressmen come to realize that the
wind of public opinion is likely to develop into a cyclone.
And now, recent decisions of the Supreme Court have

rovided ammunition to defenders of the Court, and al-
ows them to rove, or at leastattempt to prove, that the
Court is capa le of adapting itself to changing economic
and social conditions, and that such drastic reform is
unnecessary.

One of the really signiﬁcant aspects of the recent
Court decisions is the utter truthfulness of the majority
in its citation of reasons for the upholding of the Wash-
ington State Minimum Wage Lax . 2.

In this case, the Court said, in essence, that the reason
for its reversal of The Adkins vs. Children’s Hospital
decision of 1923, which had outlawed similar legislation

assed for the District of Columbia, in this case and not
in the New York Minimum Wage Law decision of a few
weeks ago was that a. reversal was not suggested in a
legal, formal way in the latter instance. Also, the ma-
jority opinion clearly recognized the vastly changed so-
cial and economic conditions, to which their attention has
been drawn for the past several years.

This frankness on the part of the Court, added to the
usual frankness of the President in defending his Court
change, represents a new era in American politics. May-
be the era of shady bargaining and petty bickering, in
terms of fundamental changes in government structure,
is at an end. Maybe American policy can be shaped by
such tactics in the future so that we do not have to look
forward with great anxiety to a duplication of vast
usurpatious of power that some of our less fortunate
European friends have known.

{EN THE SMOKE-LADEN clouds of the present

industrial unrest have blown away, some sincere
congratulations will be in order for several of Pitts-
burgh’s native sons. For real industrial statesmanship,
recognition should go to Philip Murray, head of the Steel
Workers’ Organizing Committee, and Mr. Benjamin
Fairlcss, president of the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corpora-
tion, for their ﬁnesse in handling a critical situation in
the steel industry.

We can be thankful that Pittsburgh was not forced to
go through a ‘ long-drawn-out siege, such as the one
which was Detroit's. Once more the value of mediation
before trouble arises has been indicated, and it is a tri-
bute to the far-seeing, ‘sensible industrial diplomats that
they prcventedlosses of millions of dollars by averting a
serious catastrophe such as the steel industry would have
known, if s_uch___a_p_olicy had not beenpursued.

   

I Answer to Wednesday’: Brain-Straightener?

The amount of water in the final mixture would be
I!/18ths of the total amount of liquid in the tum-
bler. The remaining 7/I8ths would be wine. This
solution is arrived at by realizing that the wine and
water in the small glass make up 1/3 of the liquid in
tho tumbler, and that in the larger glass is 2/3 of the
amount in the tumbler. 1/2 of 1/3 is 1/6, and 1/3 of
2/3 is 2/9. 1/6 and 2/9 equals 7/18tha.

He Talked
To Himself

By Milton  Lehman, Jr.

  

His name was Babbitt--George F. Babbitt, to be
3;‘_l_!",-‘

George F. Babbitt enrolled in State University in Sep-
tember, 1933. _

Babbitt learned to study-—in between Freshman Mix-
ers, Soph Hops, Junior Proms, and Senior Balls. He
met people—-~the people on campus. Soon he petitioned
for chairmanship of the Freshman Dance, and met and
handshook divers members of the Appointments Com-
mittee. Several hours after the ﬁnal interview, in which
he remarked that “What the Freshman needs for his
Dance is an attendance of Fellow Freshmen. I want to
give the Freshmen a Freshman Dance!” he learned that
he had been appointed to lead the year’s Major Social.
Aﬁ'air. - V V

The Dance came off in grand stylo,- Babbitt’s date
was adorable, and coming from Pottsville, be had become
a formidable leader on the Campus. His school work—-
whila troublesome at times—came through all right. He
received C's mostly, except for a D in French (l’°°‘“‘3¢_a
as he explained, his father wanted him to take it because
it was so cultural. But he really didn't want neither the
French nor the “D.”

In his sophomore year Babbitt, C37, led his fraternity
in 21 Sing Fest—and his fraternity won. Babbitt had one
more laurel to add to his bulging wreath. He went out
for various organizations and received many appoint-
ments. Fraternity brothers hailed him.

As a Junior, he continued his activities, became ab-
sorbed in the Social Life, fell madly in love with a
Freshman Coed he had, met at a Friday afternoon Tea
Dance.

Senior George F. Babbitt was the Leader on Campus.
He was talked about-——-sotto voce by freshmen; he was
raved about——-ecstatieally by coeds; he was hailed-—
mugniiiccntly, lovingly, fraternally, by members of
Kappa Omicron Upsilon. He was President of the Uni-
versity Glec Club, and leading member in assorted cam-
pus organizations.

Babbitt, C37, graduated in June, received his di-
ploma, went on vacation.

In 1938, Babbitt got married.

In 1939, Babbitt and his Wife moved away from his
family’s house, took an apartment.

In 1940, Babbitt found a job-—_us salesman in a de-
partment store selling ladies lingerie. ;

In 1945, Babbitt was still selling ladies lingerie. He
had two children, a boy and a girl.

In 1955, Babbitt, Sr., became elected Lion Chairman
of the Local Businessman’s Chapter of the International
Order. He had expanded from the department store to
a small habertlashery, specializing in men’s ties.

It was in 1956 that George F. Babbitt, Jr. returned
from the University-—his father's Alma Mater. He re-
turned on vslcation, excited. He had an important an-
nouncement to make.

“Say, Dad! I've just been appointed chairman of
the Freshman Dance. Guess that's keeping the old
leadership in the family, all right.” George F. Babbitt,
Jr. strutted across the living room, sat down in the old
easy chair, picked up a newspaper.

“Say Dad, what do you think of it?” he demanded.

George F. Babbitt, Sr. looked at his son, smiled.

"Yes, l guess they can never get the Babbitts down.
Not us. Yessurree. Congratulations, Junior."

Three 0’Clock In The Morning

A long distance call from CAP and GOWN headquar-
ters pulled us out of our collective beds at three this
morning . . . to inform us . . . that JOHN WERRY,
gangling junior in the College, has ﬁnally been given
the much-transferred male lead in the "musico-comedy”
. . . previously it had been tentatively held by the other
boys . . . the six-feet--four-inch blonde is a transfer from
the Johnstown branch of the University . . . spends a
couple of days each week singing a rich bass and be-
ing funny at Glee Club rehearsals . . . which reminded
us (at that early hour) . . . that the gleemen did not
receive a deserved review (for their Home Concert) in
our publication . . . downtown newspaper critics were
enthusiastic, giving not a little of the credit to the new
director, Mr. Finney . . . a quote from the review writ-
ten by RALPH LEWANDO, Pittsburgh Press music
critic . . . “The finest concert the Pitt glee club has
given in years.”

“Let’s sit this one out, Miss Blair.
Do you min_I._l’."’ .

"Oh, no. lt’s such a lovely evening.
I enjoy Spring so much.”

     

 

“Then you won’! mind if we
stroll onto the veranda, where the
sweet music will waft through the
French windows to you and mo,
beneath the liquid moon.”

“How romantic!”

''It’s a.. little chilly. Would you like
me to get something for your head?"

“Oh. no. I never wear anything on

my head.”

“Nevcr?"

“Oh, no. It’s been ages since I
wore a hat. I vaguely remember hav-
ing one in second grade.”

“That so?”

“It seems to me it was a black
velvet tam with a yellow feather
sticking up. It was a daisy!"

“I’ll bet. That moon certainly IS
swell, isn't it?”

"Yes, My hat was too small for
my head, I remember. I must have
looked awfully funny in it; They

tell me they have to quill birds to
get the feathers. Isn't. that cute?"

“That's a daisy. But don’t you feel
just a little light-headed in the Spring
evenings? I always do, especially
with a pretty girl. You’re a pretty
girl, did you know that?”

“I don’t like the creations they
have now. Some \'.'<_uuon delight in
them, but 1 don't. Deceased bird's
habiliments pcmhed on the brim.
Nothing makes me so angry as to
see a canary pc.m'ing at me from
someone’s hat in front of me in
church. I’m always afraid it will
chirp or something.”

“There's a bird chirping over in
that linden tree. Hear it? ‘Whenc’cr I
hear the harbingcrs of lovely, lovely
spring.’ Gee, that's sweet."

"Uh-bub. Do you know why I
never wear a hat? I'll bet you can’!
guess."

“Must 1?”

“It's one of life’: tribulations,
that's why. The coy aaloswoman
drags out those droopy numbers
that slant over one eyebrow, like
my cup and saucer runneth over.
I'd probably run into a street car
with one of those. Don't you
think?"

“I guess so. Aw, Miss 13.! Can't
you get into the spirit of Spring?
Moon and spoon and tune and soon
and all that?”

“You forgot goon.”

"Gee. Think of all the romance go-
ing to waste here.”

“Just like I said. There’s so much
waste in hats. They make them en-
tirely too large. The new ones are
even more brimmy.”

“It is pretty chilly out here. May-
be we’d better go back in and dance.
I think we have the next one taken,
haven’t we?"

"Must we go in? It's so roman-
tic out here. And I didn't ﬁnish
telling you about hats."

“Yes, you did.”

RYING to write something" on

schedule is a pretty discouraging
process, especially if your mind re-
»-fuses to evoke anything out of the
depths which betrays more than usu-
al substance or which might justify
._:our existence as a columnist. To ﬁnd
that of all the ideas buzzing in your
head, or the complete lack of them
sometimes, no single one of them is
of sufficient stature to warrant a
sheet of foolscap or a half-dozen
slugs of type is unﬂattering and
bound to cause a let-down.

Bound To Be Drudgary

VEN not writing on schedule,

whether done for pleasure, honor,
)1‘ money, is apt to be just as disil-
usioning. To think that even with
.1 somewhat unlimited amount of
time one cannot turn out something
decent is not conducive to one’s emo-
;ional uplift. For writing is bound
to be pretty much drudgery and very
little fun, and if there were a way to
‘iarness writers to typewriters until
‘their work is ﬁnished, I’m sure that
ve would obtain much more writing

 

even if not better writing. Or per-
iaps, to attain the former end,
.vc would need only to abolish

:hose little distractions, each of them
:0 pleasant, like knocking off for ten
minutes or so to smoke a cigarett
or listen to the radio. ‘
In such moods as that, and they

Dents To Get Results

Dental Students Perform Painless Extractions With Aid
Of "Sweet-Smelling” Fumes As Light Anesthetics;
Most Patients Go To Sleep Quietly

Friday, April 2, 193')

   

By Irving Bennett
Innocently named the hydrochloride of p-aminobenzoyl-

the little giant of the dental

profession, works just as quietly, gently, pricking the gums
and effectively numbing the mouth.

Wednesday I watched several instructors of the University
department of Anesthesia and Exodontia perform several ex-

tractions with novocain and also with-
laughing gas. A group of white-
frocked students circled the instruc-
tor who had to extract a tooth for a
nervous little high school girl.
Bathed by four powerful yellow

electric lights, the instructor went to
work, carefully selecting his instru-
ments and explaining the various
steps to his pupils. The girl was nerv-
ous as the rubber hood, reaching from
a brown laughing gas machine
was adjusted over her nose. Several
dials on a control board were twirled,
gas rushing into the girl's nose
bummed. The little girl breathed
deeply, and in a minute she was un-
conscious. Prcsto, out came the tooth,
a bloody molar. Soon the girl opened
her eyes, blankly unsceing. She shook
her head vigorously. “Oh, is it -out?”
Wanly she smiled and felt her jaw.

Actions Invariably Normal

Patients coming out of laughing
gas feel groggy and dizzy, the in-
structor said. However, while under
the effects of nitrous oxide, their re-
actions are invariably normal. Some
people believe that patients are laugh-
ing as they “go out." However,
98 per cent of the patients drop
quietly asleep. Only two per cent
show any unusual reaction. A girl
moved restlcssly on the chair-——that.
was unusual. But an expert twirl of
the dials increased the flow of one
gas and cut down the other, bring-
ing her into the normal plane.

At noon, when the patients for the-
day were finished, one student silent-
ly settled into the dental chair, while
another clamped ‘the gas hood on his
nose. In a. minute he was uncon-
scious. After he came to, for 3. min-
ute he looked emotionless, staring
straight ahead out of ‘the window. He,
too, shook his head. “Boy, that felt
good. How about some more?”

Dental students go to sleep with
laughing gas at least once. “To get
the feel of it" some even have nova-
cain shot into their gums. The in-
structor gave me a sample of laugh-
ing gas, clamping the hood onto my
nose, and shooting the gas into me.
I breathed in deeply. It tasted sweet,
so I took another breath. My head
grew light, I felt sleepy. “How does
it feel?” I was asked. I rocked on
my feet; it felt good.

Laughing Gas Misnomer

However, the name laughing gas
itself is a misnomer, say the dental
school instructors. An English chem-
ist discovered nitrous oxide, and in
1842 it was brought ‘to America on a
barustorming tour by a lecturer on
chemical phenomena. He invited
people to come onto the stage guar-
anteeing to make them laugh. When
his “patients" inhaled, they reached
a so-called “excitement stage" in
which they were stimulated and lost
their stage fright. Feeling strange,
they laughed out, and so the name
“laughing gas” was born. An Ameri-
can dentist, Dr. Horace Wells of Hart-
ford, Connecticut, noticed that the
“patient” might bump into a chair,
start an ugly bleeding wound, but
show no pain. The dentist had the
gas administered to himself, and had
one of his teeth pulled. It didn't hurt,

and laughing gas as a dental anes-
thetic had its first use.

Dental school instructors don't be-
lieve that women make braver ‘pa-
tients than men, or men than women.
“Look over there!” An old man was
having nearly all of his teeth ex-
tracted. He gripped the chair, while
the lights beat on him and sweat stood
out on his bald head. But he said
never a word.

“Dentists Work Hard"

The University dental department.
the instructors point out, is one of
the eight in the country giving post-
graduate instruction in general anes-
thesia for dental surgery. In lecture
instruction, dental students here have
more hours per week than they would
at any other school in the country. In
practical experience oﬁered, the Uni-
versity dental school rates with the
first ﬁve of the country.

With possible exceptions, dental
students work harder than any others.
I resolve never to quibble at the
amount of a dentist's bill—maybe.
