MEN’S BASKETBALL

Second-half
surge leads

Panthers over 
Penn State

Mike Young was bruised, battered and
blocked just in Pitt’s ﬁrst few possessions
Tuesday. The trend continued for the men’s
basketball team throughout the half, but
Young might have struggled the most.

And yet Younglled Pitt in scoring with
six points in the ﬁrst half.

It took 14 points from Talib Zanna in the 72‘ . . »

second half and 12 from Lamar Patterson in
the ﬁnal 20 minutes to lead Pitt to a78-69
comeback victory against Penn State at the
Petersen Events Center.

“Penn State’s a great team, we just had
to adjust,” Patterson said. “They threw
the ﬁrst punch in the ﬁrst half. I think our
team responded well in the second half.”

The Panthers (8-0) shot just 28 percent
in the ﬁrst half, but were saved at the foul
line by making 13-of—14 shots to stay within
two of Penn State (6-3) at the half, trail-
ing 3o—28. The offense struggled to move
the ball, evidenced at the half by Young’s
team—high total of six points, all of which
came from free throws.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGB unanimously votes to amend bylaws

Danielle Fax
Staff Writer

Before the 2012-2013 Student Govern-
ment Board leaves office in January, it
will leave its mark on SGB’s rulebook.
The Board voted unanimously at the
final meeting of its members’ terms
Tuesday night to amend its bylaws.
While the majority of the revisions are
semantic, SGB President Gordon Loud-
erback said the changes were-necessary

in order to reflect recent changes to
the constitution as well as to officially
outline additional responsibilities for
the president and Board members.

Under the amended bylaws, Board
members must attend meetings for
committees to which he or she is ap-
pointed and meet “once a month and
as needed” with the committee chair
for whom heor she is a liaison.

Louderback said the revisions to
the bylaws — the rules that govern
the responsibilities and processes of
the Board —- are “nothing significant.”

“There is nothing outstanding, like,
‘Whoa, we put that in there‘?’” Louder-
back said.

Board of Trustees approves salary increase for seven oﬂicials, chancellor

. Em Maier
Assistant News Editor

Pitt’s Board of Trustees Compensation
Committee approved salary increases for
seven University officers and Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg.

During a 15-minute conference call
meeting Tuesday morning in Posvar Hall,
the Committee voted to increase the sala-
ries of seven ofﬁcers, bringing the seven
salaries to a total of $3,707,500. Norden-
berg himself received a 3-percent increase,
bringing his salary to $597,500 for his ﬁnal
term as chancellor.

In addition to Nordenberg, the in-
creases — which will be retroactive to
July 1, 2013, the beginning of the current
ﬁscal year —— were also for Patricia Beeson,
Jerome Cochran, Barbara Jean Ferketish,
Arthur Levine, Amy Marsh, Arthur Rami-
cone and P. Jerome Richey.

Stephen R. Tritch, chair of the board
and the committee, noted the progress
the University has made in the past year:
a record—breaking number of applications
(27,634) , which is 11 percent larger than
the pool for 2012.

Tritch noted that Pitt succeeded in
“surpassing a very ambitious $2.5 billion
fundraising goal.” He continued by citing
the numerous scholarships and fellow-
ships awarded to Pitt students as well as
the University’s ascent in rankings, with
respect to beneﬁcence from internship, re-
search productivity and academic settings.

The average Pitt faculty member re-
ceived a 4.3 percent salary increase, with
23 percent of faculty members receiving
increases higher than 5 percent.

Tritch introduced Nordenberg after
stating the changes that have occurred
in the past year, describing his term as
an “extended period of really remarkable

progress.” He highlighted the chancellor’s

activity in civic associations around the _

city, particularly with respect to education.

“I have enormous respect for all of the
people of Pitt and am deeply grateful for
the contributions that have been made by
so many — faculty, students, staff, alumni
and friends —,to the University’s prog-
ress,” N ordenberg said.

Noting that it was his last chance to
publicly comment on the oﬁicers, Norden-
berg described them as “an extraordinary
group in terms of individual talents and
the commitment to Pitt that is regularly
demonstrated.” ’

“It is also an extraordinary group in
terms of their demonstrative willingness
and ability to function as a team, some-
thing that never should be taken for grant-
ed,” he added.

The board stated that an independent
consultant compares the salaries of Pitt

. ofﬁcers to the salaries of ofﬁcers at simi-

lar institutions and noted that Pitt pays
its ofﬁcers less than their counterparts
elsewhere. -

“Throughout his service, N ordenberg’s
compensation has lagged behind the com-

~ pensation received by many of his peers,”

Tritch said.
Nordenberg had repeatedly requested

» during previous salary negotiations that

his increase be lower than any of the other
percent increases to ofﬁcers. He had “re-
sisted increases in previous years as well,
Tritch noted. ’ ’

“The existence of that gap is not re-

ﬂective of any reluctance on the part of
the Compensation Committee to raise his

compensation. Instead, it is the product of '

his own resistance to any salary increases
beyond those of a modest size,” Tritch
said. I

In wake of explosion, students

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

Kayla Keddal didn’t know the Central
Oakland house she shared with three
other students was empty when it ex-
ploded. ‘

Keddal received a call last Thursday
night from her landlord, who said police
had told her there was smoke coming
from her house on Dawson Street.

But when Keddal returned from her
mother’s house in Peters Township,
where she was visiting for Thanksgiv-
ing, she did not expect the scene that
awaited her when she arrived at her house
at about 11 p.m. after ﬁreﬁghters had put

out the ﬂames and described the situation -

as “like something from a horror movie.”
She said the water used to put the ﬁre

out was pouring through the ceiling of
the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Arson investigators and

ﬁreﬁghters moved around inside the .

charred remains of the structure. From
the porch, Keddal saw that her ceiling
fan had melted.

When she ﬁrst arrived, Keddal did not
know that the two students who shared
the second ﬂoor of the house, where an
explosion had ripped apart three walls,
had not been inside that evening. She
panicked and began crying.

“[Fireﬁghters] had to tell me three
times that no one was hurt,” she said.

Michael Burford, an investigator with
the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, said ﬁre-
ﬁghters had to tear down the building
after the ﬁre was extinguished because
the explosion had rendered it unsafe. ‘

Three of the four people who lived

find place in campus housing

in the house that stood at 3376 Dawson

‘' St. until Thursday were Pitt students.

In addition to Keddal, a Pitt senior who
shared the ﬁrst ﬂoor with a Point Park
University student, seniors Ally Becker

_ and Ian Quinn, shared the second ﬂoor.

Keddal, Becker and Quinn are now stay-
ing in University housing.

John Fedele, a Pitt spokesman, said
Panther Central and Pitt’s Qfﬁce of Stu-
dent Affairs works with students in situ-
ations like this and similar cases to make
sure they have places to live when they
return to Oakland. . ‘ _

“Our general approach to these types
of issues is to provide housing for the
remainder of the semester, and we will
make it available for spring if they can’t
ﬁnd another place to live,”‘ Fedele said
in an email.

Fedele said the students will be able to
stay in University housing for free until
the end of this semester.

“If they decide to stay on campus next
semester, they will be charged for their
rooms,” he said.

Pitt did the samefor the students who

were  without a place to live after a ﬁre I

destroyed their Zulema Street apartment
last spring, according to Fedele.
, Becker said that a University employee
contacted her the day after the blast and
told her that Pitt would try to ﬁnd a room
for her in on—campus housing. The em-
ployee instructed her to go to Panther
Central when she returned to Pittsburgh.
When Becker returned to Oakland on

addition of section 1.15 to the bylaws,
which requires the president to “guide
and coordinate the transition process
between the incoming and outgoing
boards,” is a significant revision.
Louderback said Board members
and presidents were already expected
to handle these responsibilities, but it
was not officially noted in the bylaws.
Louderback already required current
Board members to submit “transition
documents” detailing the projects on
which they worked during their terms.
SGB also hosted a meeting between the

i incoming and outgoing Board members

and a meeting between SGB’s incoming
and outgoing committee chairs Monday
night.

Although thecurrent Board decided
on the revisions, the incoming Board
members will be the first to test the
amended bylaws.

SGB’s Judicial Committee drafted
therevisions. Joseph Kozak, the com-
mittee’s chair, said he and the other
members brieﬂy considered last month
whether to leave the decision to the next
Board because it is so late in the texim.

Kozak said the proposal for the revi-
sion was mostly complete by Oct. 24 but
that his committee was “sidetracked”
by the revisions it wrote for the SGB

Constitution and could not review it
until Nov. 7.

He said he was initially apprehensive
about introducing the revisions because
campaign season had already begun,
and the revisions would inﬂuence pro-
spective board members who were un-
aware of the additional responsibilities
outlined in the amended bylaws.

Louderback disagreed.

“The revisions were public before
the election, so if [the candidates] had
any disagreements with them, they

Despite apprehension, Kozak agreed
with Louderback that the changes were
necessary to reflect the updated con-
stitution.

One of the three referenda approved
by the student body in last month’s SGB
election removed Section 2 of the SGB
Constitution and inserted it into the
Board’s bylaws as sections 1.11 and 2.05.
These sections state that the president

ceive the highest number ofvotes in the
SGB election must serve as representa-

could have withdrawn themselves from
the race,” Louderback said.
Louderback said it is typical for
boards and committees to change
documents at the end of their terms
to “reflect on what they’ve learned in
the past year to better the document.”

tives to the University Senate Council.
Kozak said that if the incoming
Board does not agree with the revisions,
its members can choose to change the
bylaws themselves.
Mike Nites, the incoming Board
president, said he supports the revi-

sions. The incoming Board discussed
additional revisions when it met Tues-
day night.

Nites said the incoming Board has
discussed immediately introducing a
revision to allow outgoing committee
chairs to help pick their replacements,
in addition to other bylaw revisions.

“We are going to take it one step fur-
ther,” Nites said.

In other action:

Louderback introduced a resolution
to publicly support future involvement
with the Atlantic Coast Conference Stu-
dent Government Conference.

Pitt’s SGB partnered with Florida
State University’s student government
to host the inaugural ACC Student
Government Conference on Sept. 1-2.
Student governments from 12 of the
15 ACC member schools attended the
conference at Pitt.

“It was a great way to meet other SGB
members ofthe ACC and open that line
of communication where I can easily
call or text one of them and get their
opinion or help on a project that I’m
working on,” Louderback said.

Although the Board will no longer
meet publicly, Louderback said they
will vote on the resolution over email
after one week, which Louderback said
will allow for a period of discussion.

While it will be easy for Becker, Quinn

Obamacare: good intent, bad policy

Matt Barnes
Columnist

On March 23, 2010, The Patient
Protection and Affordable Care
Act, otherwise known as Obam-
acare, was signed into law. The
government overhaul of our
nation’s health care system has
proved controversial ever since.
Upon the law’s enactment, many
Americans lauded politicians
such as President Barack Obama
and then—House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi for their efforts to make
health care aifor‘dable for eve

American citizen. V

For years, patients with pre-
existing conditions were subject
to coverage denial because of
their unfortunate health status.
If not rejected, patients with such
conditions were offered premi-
ums at incredibly high rates. The
Affordable Care Act mandated
that this unfair practice no lon-
ger continue.

The law also permits indi-
viduals to stay on their parents’
health insurance plans until the
age of 26, granting comfort to
those struggling to ﬁnd a job in

today’s bleak job market. Along .

with these beneﬁts, Americans
have been promised that insur-
ance plans will lose cost but not
quality. They have been promised
that their current plans would
be kept free from government
takeover.

From the outside, it sounds
great. Yet why are so many
against the seemingly auspi-
cious health care system? Simple.
Through the Affordable Care Act,
Americans are experiencing the
inconvenience and problems
government over-involvement
creates.

Clearly, Obamacare has good
intentions, but it’s a bad policy.

Beyond the favorite talking
points of pro-Obamacare pundits
lies more than 2,400 pages and
381,000 words of overreaching

‘legislation. When legislators

voted yea or nay on the Alford-

.able Care Act, little was known

about its actual content. It is
difficult to imagine that all nine
justices, both of the majority and
dissent, possessed a comprehen-
sive knowledge of the bill when
the Supreme Court decided its
constitutionality in June 2012.

This is not a negative assess-
ment of lawmakers or justices;
it is the consequence of the bill’s
massive nature.

. Which begs the question: How
could anyone fully understand
it? As the law rolls out, experts
try to comprehend the act, and
bureaucrats attempt to interpret
it despite the fact that neither are
adequately equipped to do so.

What we do know is that the
bill is not living up to its prom-
ises. As it turns out, the Afford-
able Care Act is not so afford-
able. In 41 states, premiums in
the individual market have risen
by more than 40 percent. Some
states have seen premiumgrowth
at an inexcusable rate, includ-
ing Nevada (179 percent), New
Mexico (142 percent), Arkansas
(138 percent), North Carolina
(136 percent) and Vermont (117
percent).

This reverse effect was not

entirely unforeseen. In 2009, '

before the law was passed, the
Congressional Budget Ofﬁce
found that premiums would in
fact increase because of the bill’s
near-innumerable regulations.
Remember, the actual bill itself

comprises an already verbose
381,000 words. Compared to
another word count, this num-
ber is diminutive.

There are about 11,588,500
words of Obamacare—related
regulations. There is absolutely
no possible way that a central
entity, no matter how potent, ef-
ﬁcient or effective, could possibly
enforce such a law without bur-
dening those whom it is meant
to protect.

But the negative economic
impact of the law goes beyond
increases in health care costs.
Overregulation related to the Af-
fordable Care Act has not devel-
oped the economy, but drained it.
It has not promoted competition,
but constrained it. Many protest
against the wrongdoings of big

4 business, but how can anyone

expect to give big business legiti-
mate competition if policies such
as Obamacare continue to crush
smaller and growing entities?

The Affordable Care Act is
projected to have a negative ef-
fect on hospitals, nonproﬁts, mu-
nicipal and state governments,
educational institutions, labor
unions and small businesses.
This reality impedes growth of
industries responsible for pro-
viding jobs to countless Ameri-
cans.

Consequently, employees are
losing beneﬁts by the demotions
forced upon them by the Afford-
able Care Act. Workers who pre-
viously enjoyed ﬁill-time status
have been conveniently bumped
down to a part-time 29-hour
week. Whether or not one ﬁnds
this practice ethical or troubling
is not the point. The reality is

that employers have a right to legally react
as they feel necessary.

Additionally, many have not been de-
moted but let go altogether. People losing
jobs means less prosperity and economic
growth. Because of the overbearing bur-
den forced upon businesses by Obam—
acare, negative consequences are trickling
down from government to business to

Overall, after a simple, rational analy-
sis of the Affordable Care Act, one should
see that despite its good intentions, it
fails to protect patients or provide afford-
able quality health insurance. Perhaps
more importantly is that it economically
weakens the country and inhibits future
growth of industry and competition: two

’ the Nittany Lions by double-digits, was

minutes away from an upset loss.

Pitt’s next basket was a 3-pointer by
redshirt senior forward Lamar Patterson,
who emerged from a trio of screens on the
opposite side of the ﬂoor from when Talib
Zanna held the ball in the post. Zanna
passed to Patterson, who then canned
the triple and whipped the Oakland Zoo
into a frenzy. ‘

About two minutes later, after Penn

State’s D.j. Newbill made a 3-pointer out

of a timeout to draw within a point, Pat-
terson found sophomore point guard
James Robinson for a layup. With a minute

remaining, Patterson then found himself ’

with the ball after Pitt broke Penn State’s
full-court press, isolated against Ross
Travis. _

“It just happened,” Patterson said of
the sequence. “I saw he was big, I knew I
could take a big off the dribble, so I just
went upon myself there.”

Patterson attacked Travis off the
dribble, laid the ball in and drew a foul,
off which he made his and-one attempt.
Pitt led by eight points after Patterson’s
bucket and free throw, its largest lead of
the game until that point. .

Behind Zanna and Patterson, Pitt
controlled the ﬁnal minutes of Tuesday’s
game, which led to a 78-69 Pitt victory
against Penn State as a part of the ACC—Big
Ten Challenge. Pitt’s two seniors helped
the Panthers overcome a sloppy ﬁrst half
in which they shot just 7—of—25 from the
ﬁeld and trailed 30-28 at halftime, guid-
ing Pitt to victory.

“We didn’t say it verbally, but we just
knew,” Patterson said of ﬁnishing the
game strongly. “Being the older guys, we

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Kiesel eyes
milestone, Pitt
aims to rebound

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

If there was a bright spot in Pitt’s loss
to Buffalo, it emanated from Brianna
Kiesel.

Kiesel, who leads the team in points,
assists and minutes, usually stands out
in any contest. Through the Panthers’
first seven games, the junior guard has
led the team in scoring five times. Sun-
day was no different, as she scored a
game—high 17 points, 15 of which-came
in a second half that featured the resur-
gence of Pitt’s offense and a comeback
effort.

As Pitt (4-3) prepares for its eighth
game — tonight at 7 againstjames Madi-
son at the Petersen Events Center -
looking to rebound from its most recent
loss, Kiesel is likely to remain the focus
of the event. '

She’s nearing a historic scoring mark
in her career, just 39 points from total-
ing 1,000 as a Panther. Only 16 women
have reached the 1,000-point milestone
in their careers at Pitt.

But Kiesel isn’t the only player who
could light up the scoreboard tonight.
James Madison (5-2) features the Co-
lonial Athletic Association Preseason
Player of the Year, Kirby Burkholder.

Burkholder, a 6-foot senior, also ap-
peared as an honoree on the Naismith
Award Watch List before the season. She
averages 19gpoints and 8.7 rebounds per
game. However, Burkholder, the team’s
leading‘ scorer,. has been inconsistent

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon found fault in
the team’s poor performance from the ﬂoor,
remarking that the stat book told the tale
of the Panthers’ miserable play.

“I spent the whole halftime emphasizing
our number of assists,” Dixon said. “Three
is not a good number for us, and sometimes
the stats don’t lie —- and that sort of was it.
[We were] just impatient, didn’t let things
come.”

Joining Patterson and Zanna, who ﬁn-
ished with 16 points each, were Cam Wright
(12 points) andjames Robinson (10), who
each attained double ﬁgures as well.

“In the ﬁrst half, we kind of tried to force
a lot of shots,” Zanna said. “Our shot wasn’t
falling in. The second half, we came in and
changed some principles.”

Nothing changed at ﬁrst. An ominous
start plagued Pitt in the second half, and it
looked like the Panthers might head down
the same path that led them to ﬁve ﬁrst—half
turnovers. On Pitt’s ﬁrst possession, Young
aggressively drove halfway to the hoop,
but was cleanly blocked when he went to

hoist a shot,

Then Zanna and Young couldn’t scoop
up a wide-open rebound after Penn State
missed a shot, and the ball bounced off
Young’s shoe. The Nittany Lions used the
extra possession to hit a 3-pointer.

But Zanna made up for that miscue ——
and not just offensively.

Just a couple minutes after that gaffe,
Zanna guarded Penn State guard Tim Fra-

zier at half-court. Frazier had already diced ‘ A

the Panthers for 17 points with just under

14 minutes to play, but Zanna poked the '
ball away from his handle to record a steal. _ —
The redshirt senior center raced Frazier

the length of the court and ﬁnished the play’
with a layup at the other end that put the
Panthers ahead, 42-41, and forced a Penn
State timeout. ' '
Next, Zanna worked the glass, coming
alive en roufe to snaring four second—half
rebounds of his 10 total. After grabbing a
defensive rebound from Frazier’s missed
jumper, he pushed the ball up court, even-

tually receiving it again once he made his -

way to the post.
From there, Zanna was double-teamed,
but dished to Patterson, who shot a 3-point-

Kiesel is approaching the 1,000 point mark. Jeff Ahearn | Staff Photographer

If there was a bright spot in Pitt’s loss
to Buffalo, it emanated from Brianna
Kiesel.

Kiesel, who leads the team in points,
assists and minutes, usually stands out
in any contest. Through the Panthers’
first seven games, the junior guard has

day was no different, as she scored a

As Pitt (4-3) prepares for its eighth
game — tonight at 7 against James
Madison at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter ~— looking to rebound from its most
recent loss, Kiesel is likely to remain
the focus of the event.

She’s nearing a historic scoring mark
in her career, just 39 points from total—
ing 1,000 as a Panther. Only 16 women
have reached the 1,000—point milestone
in their careers at Pitt.

But Kiesel isn’t the only player who

could light up the scoreboard tonight.
James Madison (5-2) features the Co-
lonial Athletic Association Preseason
Player of the Year, Kirby Burkholder.

Burkholder,,a 6—foot senior, also ap-
peared as an honoree on the Naismith
Award Watch List before the season. She
averages 19 points and 8.7 rebounds per
game. However, Burkholder, the team’s
leading scorer, has been inconsistent
during the Dukes’ past two games.

Against Mississippi State, she made
just two of 14 field goals and was held
to nine points in 31 minutes -— thanks
in part to a 5-of-5 free-throw shooting
effort. During the next game against
Wright State, though, Burkholder went
off for 26 points on 10-of-21 shooting
and grabbed 10 rebounds.

The result forjames Madison was the
same, however. The Dukes dropped both
contests to mark their first losses of the
season after starting out 5-0.

handing out ﬁve assists and pulling in
six rebounds. According to head coach

second half in the way he handled the
pressure'Penn State put on the Panthers
in screen-rolls.

“They trapped, ‘blitzed’ as weﬂcall 
it, ball screens on Lamar, and he didn’t 

handle it well early,” Dixon said. “He tried
to make a play when all he had to do was
make the next pass and got better in the
second half.”

Zanna posted his second doub1e—dou-
ble of the season with 16 points and 10
rebounds.

“They brought more energy than we
had to begin,” point guard James Robin-
son said. “I think we came out ﬂat.”

Zanna in particular impressed Penn _,

State head coach Patrick Chambers, who
said the big man from Nigeria “looks ter-
riﬁc” and has “gotten a lot better” since
Chambers recruited Zanna years ago
when Chambers was an assistant at Vil-
lanova.

“Talib was great,” Chambers said. “He
did what he was supposed to do, and La-
mar hit a huge three that helped them out
and gave them some energy.”

Dixon said his two seniors were “just

better” in the second half, which helped .

Pitt outscore the Nittany Lions by 11

points in the game’s second 20 minutes.

“I thought Talib was really good the
whole game as far as just being patient,
letting the ball come to him,” Dixon said.
“We thought they’d dig down in the post

._ a little bit more and help, but they really

V5 that’s why Talib was 7—for-11 and got to

the foul line.”

“Theywentvsmall, so we had to adjust
some stuff,” Zanna said. “The paint was
wide open, so i just had to go iso. and take
my manlone—on—‘one.”

Zanrla made an impact on the defen—h

sive side of the ball as well. Zanna came up
to hedge on a screen intended for Tim Fra-
zier, but instead, picked Frazier’s pocket
and took the ball himself for a layup.

Zanna also saved two points by block-
ing a layup attempt by Newbill when the
Panthers led by one point with 2:55 to
play.

“That’s what you expect from one
of your senior leaders,” Patterson said.
“That’s Pitt basketball right there. We do
it on both ends of the ﬂoor.”

And for the younger guys, Patterson
and Zanna set an example for them to fol-
low by embodying what they’ve learned
in their last four—plus years playing Pitt
basketball.-

“I think Talib with his energy on both
ends of the court, and Lamar with his
playmaking and his energy, the younger
guys on the team, we just kind of rallied
around him,” Robinson said. I

Although Pitt has won two of its past
three games, that doesn’t put the Pan-
thers in a much brighter situation.

“We prepared for [Buffalo’s] match-
up and knew what we wanted to run,
but we are a team that struggles if we
don’t start strong,” head coach Suzie
McConnell—Serio said after the game,
which began with the Panthers giving up
10 unanswered points. “I’m frustrated
with our execution, decision-making
and turnovers — things we try to be
disciplined on offensively.”

Despite her leadership role on the
court, Kiesel is no exception and will
have to pace Burkholder to keep the

Panthers in the game offensively. Mov-
ing closer to 1,000 career points would
be an added bonus.

Just how proliﬁc has Kiesel’s scoring
been through the start of her junior
year? For comparison, Burkholder just
eclipsed 1,000 points this season in
her ﬁnal year.

At her current pace of 15 points per
game, Kiesel might not reach the mile-
stone against James Madison. It would
take an above-average performance
from Kiesel, whose career—high point
total is 28, but so far she’s proven that
she’s going to shine in most of the Pan-
thers’ games..

Whether or not Kiesel reaches that
milestone against James Madison to-
night depends on exactly how bright
she decides to shine. I
