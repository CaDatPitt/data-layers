A mind over meteorology

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

Like most commuters at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, part-time writ‘-
ing instructor Michael Robbins
travels daily through the snow and
slush, forced to deal with the perils
of a frigid winter in Pittsburgh.
However, Robbins leaves his coat,
scarf and gloves at home in his
closet.

Clad only in a T-shirt, trousers
and shoes, 44-year old Robbins cas-
ually walks around campus, unaf-
fected by the l2 degree temperature
outside.

“The fact that people are uncom-
fortable in cold weather,” Robbins
explained, “isn’t so much to do with
the objective issue of whether it’s
cold or not or what the temperature
is. It’s the more subjective issue of
how do they think about it.”

Robbins began thinking about the
effects of weather on people while
attending St. Vincent College in

Author Clark Blaise, a former Pittsburgh
resident, will give a reading from_his soon-
to-be-published short story.

The Mortar Board Society is planning an
organ donor awareness drive.

Latrobe, Pa. Fascinated by the
behavior of people, he observed that
if someone was upset about some-
thing, he could go out in bad
weather without much protective
clothing and not realize until after-
ward that he had done it, “because
he did not think about it at that
time.”

Robbins said he first encountered
this behavior while watching several
students clown around in his dormi-
tory. At one point, they ran out into
the snow wearing only underwear
and wrestled around for‘ about 20
minutes. “At the time,” he said,
“they didn’t seem to be paying atten-
tion to it.

“At some point in the early ’70s,”
Robbins said, “these thoughts came
back into my head, and to this day, I
don’t know why they did.

“I thought, well, gee, I wonder if
it’s possible just as a hypothetical
thing for somebody to just not be
bothered by that [the weather].”

Curious about the effects of
weather on people, Robbins decided
to “play with it a little bit to see what
the effect would be."

He explained: “The first time I
tried it, it was the dead of winter, and
I decided to just stop wearing my
coat to see what would happen. It
was a bit s-hocking, but at the same
time, it wasn't as overwhelming as I
thought it would be.

“When that happened, I kind of
logically thought through it. I
thought that, when you think of how
many people don’t wear hats ever,

‘ don’t wear gloves ever, wear ﬂimsy

shoes anyway, the parts of the body
that are protected are the parts that
don’t need it as much, usually, as the
parts that are exposed. So really,
most people are running around
exposed more than they ought to be;
and they don’t think about that
part,” Robbins said.

Robbins said he pondered that
idea until the next year after he
“fiddled around with it a little bit.”
He found that going without a coat
was a little uncomfortable but not
what he thought it would be.

“I really expected it to be some-
how radically overwhelming to do
this, and it wasn’t,” Robbins said.

Disagreement has arisen between
Governor Dick Thornburg and Pitt
officials as to whether a $2.5 million
appropriation to the Falk Clinic
should be included in the fiscal year
’85 budget. -

The governor recently announced
a four-percent increase in funding
for state-related schools in the fiscal
year ’86. The disagreement is over
whether Pitt would receive its full
four percent from the governors
proposal.

Pitt officials said that funding for
the Falk Clinic should be included
on the fiscal year ’85 budget, thereby
making the total allocation from the
state $89.7 million. The state, how-
ever, is assuming that the Falk Clinic
funding is not part of the budget,
thereby making the total allocation
roughly $87 million. The increase of
four percent would then, according
to the state, give Pitt $90.7 million.
According to Pitt’s interpretation of
the budget, this increase is only one
percent over the fiscal year '85
budget.

Dr. Jack Freeman, executive vice
president of Pitt, said that the Falk
Clinic was left out of the state budget

NASA a

due to an oversight. “We had under-
stood this to be a continuing appro-
priation," he said. “We hope to have
this reinstated to give us parity with
other state-related universities."

Although President Wesley Pos-
v.ar said that the four-percent
increase represents recognition on
Thornburg’s part that “our higher
education institutions are essential
to the economic growth of the com-
monwealth.” He added that the
proposal “barely represents a cost of
living increase for the University of
Pittsburgh.” He explained that “our
documented financial requirements
to meet new, essential instructional
support needs such as computeriza-
tion,v telecommunications and
advanced laboratory instrumenta-
tion will require funding well above
the governor’s recommendation.”

Freeman concurred with Posvar,
saying that “our financial needs are
rising much more rapidly than infla-
tion.” He attributed the high operat-
ing cost to attempts to “posture the
university’s academic programs to
meet the high technology demands
of the commonwealth.”

If the confusion over the Falk
Clinic funding cannot be worked out
and the governor's proposal is
approved as is, Freemanisaid there
may be major budgetary problems:

high-tech at Pitt

By Sandra Cappa
The Pitt News

Technology generated by NASA
research not only enables the United
States to undertake interplanetary
exploration, but by seeking to dis-
cover a larger world, NASA is
simultaneously providing answers
to many questions about our imme-»
diate environment.

NASA’s Industrial Applications
Center at Pitt coordinates this
research and serves as an interme-
diary between industry and the com-
bined resources of government and
education.

“It really comes down to the issue
of creative technology transfer,"
said Mark V. Cromie, the center’s
senior marketing manager.

“It’s being creative enough to look
at the technology and make it [use- «
ful], that’s what we attempt to do,”
said Paul A. McWilliams, NIAC
executive director‘ and assistant
provost.

Selected by Congress in I964, Pitt
has one of the seven centers nation-
wide and serves the eastern part of
the United States. Through the dis-

semination of NASA technology,
wide range data bases, academic
research and professional expertise
available at Pitt, NIAC is able to
translate information into public
services and social programs bene-
fiting Pittsburgh and other areas.

Since 1980, when McWilliams
became executive director, the
NIAC has concentrated on finding
new ways to make the products of
research available to interested busi-
nesses and industries.

By taking advantage of NIAC’s
services, clients can become aware of
existing technologies, initiate new
programs, and remain competitive.

“We can match industrial need
with the strategies required in adapt-
ing emerging technologies,”
explained McWilliams.

The Goodyear Company, faced
with a substantial decline in produc-
tion, turned to the NIAC at Pitt for
assistance. An l8-month search for
prospective products and methods
to retrain unemployed workers led‘
to three new product lines.

The NIAC is also active in aiding
Pittsburgh’s faltering steel industry
in the adaption of NIAC‘s opera-
tions. “Many companies realize that

Drive for donor awareness

By Samuel Thompson
The Pitt News

Mortar Board, a service-oriented
senior honor society, is sponsoring
an organ donor awareness drive at
four Pittsburgh universities this
week to coincide with National
Mortar Board week.

The drive is aimed “to teach the
public and to get support” for organ
donation. Mortar Board chapters at
Pitt, Carnegie-Mellon, Duquesne

and Chatham College will partici-
pate. Mortar Board will present a
seminar on Wednesday, Feb. 13 for
area high school students, featuring
liver transplant surgeon Robert
Gordon, Brian Reames, a Pitt stu-
dent and heart transplant recipient,
Fr. Frank Pezzulo and a donor fam-
ily. Booths manned by Mortar
Board members and volunteers will
also be a part of the effort, and the
last phase of the drive is a “citywide"
effort to bring donor cards to the
public.

The group targeted high school
students because they are

“extremely energetic," said Pitt
chapter president Jimmy Krell. Over
160 high schools have been invited
and Krell expects 175 people to
attend. Further letters urging parti-
cipation have been sent to Plus
7,500 employees. Interested volun-
teers are still needed and should con-
tact Jimmy Krell at 361-2255.

Booths will operate this Thursday
and Friday in the Towers Lobby, the
ground floor of the Cathedral and
the student union, the fourth floor of
Scaife Hall and various other loca-
tions around campus.

their products are no longer right for
their market. Instead of scrapping
the existing operation, we research
to produce something more applica-
ble,” McWilliams said.

Outside of their involvement in
industry, the NIAC at Pitt volun-
teered its resources in the nation-
wide search for two young boys
from Des Moines, Iowa, where
efforts by the police and FBI have
thus far been unsuccessful. The Pitt
NIAC suggested that authorities use
a soil sampler that measures the level
of alkaline in the ground to check for
the presence of a decomposed body.

In 1984, the center had 750
requests for data —— six times the
number of requests in I980.

For a fee ranging from $200 to
$150,000, a client seeking informa-
tion can search through the center's
nearly 400 data bases. The informa-
tion can be retrieved from a number
of sources and is usually made avail-
able via direct computer hookup.

NIAC draws on the talents of Pitt
faculty. “We can’t afford the luxury
of specializing in a single area,”
Cromie commented.

“We have developed our own
human resources data base. We have
found people at Pitt who are very
knowledgeable in all areas,” said
McWilliams.

The center has grown in impor-
tance at Pitt, as evidenced by
McWilliams’ dual role: NIAC direc-

tor and the university’s assistant
provost. Before 1980 the center was
under the Knowledge and Availabil-
ity Systems section of the Library
and Information Science center,
instead of the Provost's office.

Paul McWilliams has been
selected by the U.S. Information
Agency to conduct a series of semi-
nars in West Germany dealing with
the successful management of
academic, governmental and indus-
trial relations in terms of research
opportunities.

He also spoke before the House
subcommittee on the merchant
marine in favor of legislation
designed to help modernize and revi-
talize the commercial shipbuilding
and repair industry in the U.S. and
create more employment opportuni-
ties in a number of related areas.

NIAC is also working with the
University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate
School of Public Health. NIAC
developed an audio visual package
on hearing loss prevention targeted

at blue-collar workers in the refrac- I

tories industry. Employees nation-
wide are able to use the information
from NASA, the GSPH faculty and
the Refractories Institute to protect
their hearing.

“Pittsburgh will always be
branded in my imagination,”
remarked writer Clark Blaise whose
books and short stories are
renowned in the U.S. and in Can-
ada. His reading Wednesday night
at the University of Pittsburgh is the
first in a series of weekly readings,
lectures and workshops in honor of
I985, The Year of the Pennsylvania
Writer.

“What do I have uncovered that
people usually have covered?” he
asked. “My arms, my chest and
back,” he answered. “When you
think about it, that’s all that is differ-
ent in what I'm doing — that‘s really
all.”

The following winter, Robbins
decided not to wear a coat as the
weather got colder, and to wear the
same clothes he wore in the summer.

“As I did that, it came to my mind
that, mostly, the temperature

changes over a number of months 4‘

only a few degrees at a time,” Rob-
bins explained. “And I had never
actually thought about that until I
started doing this.”

As the winter months went by,
Robbins observed that he adjusted
to the temperature changes. “I
thought, this really isn’t so bad
either, and the weather was a little
tougher that year. As long as my feet
were warm, I discovered, mostly it's
not such a big thing.”

Robbins made it through the win-
ter by “just sort of bluffing my way
through it. ljust said, ‘Well, I’ve
started, so let’s see how far I can go
with it.’ ”

Now, Robbins still leaves home
without his coat. Looking back. he
recalled two steps which have

Justice,” “Lunar Attractions”) and
short stories chronicle adolescent
experiences that Blaise acquired
during his “seven or eight years of
solid Pittsburgh life."

“Pittsburgh was the formative
experience of a young American
male," said Blaise, who moved into
the area at I4 after attending over 30
public schools throughout the U.S.
and Canada. “It was the place of my
first date. my firstjob, my first small
success  and of my calling.”

Although Blaise grew up in Castle
Shannon and graduated from
Mount Lebanon High School, he
spent most of his time in the city. “I
was always at Pitt or Squirrel Hill,

enabled him to survive the winters.
First, he quit watching the weather
reports on the evening news.

“When you really realize it,” Rob-
bins said, “the weather people tend
to exaggerate how bad the weather is
going to be. That made a tremend-
ous difference in my own mind not
getting psyched up to look for some-
thing bad.”

The second step was to remain
relaxed outside. “If I just kept
relaxed,” he pointed out, “all those
weird gyrations didn’t take over, and
I didn’t feel uncomfortable like
other people would.”

As Robbins walks around with-
out his coat, he admits that reactions
are mixed. “Recently, a young guy
stopped me downtown and said,
‘Excuse me. It’s none of my business,
but I've got an extra sweater in this
bag I’m carrying. Do you want it?’
‘No,’ I said. ‘I’m perfectly fine.’ ”

People would often approach
Robbins and offer him something to
wear. One woman, he said, actually
pulled him into a department store,
determined to buy him a coat. He
graciously refused.

Others, though, showed hostility
toward Robbins. “I've had people
scream at me, and I’ve had people
call me names,” he said. Once he

   

or just wandering through the city,”
said Blaise, who also worked at the
Carnegie Museum of Art and His-
tory and at Buhl Planetarium. “I was
an active part of the young arts
community."

The calling, Blaise said, came in
high school after a creative writing
course. “I decided then that I wanted
to write. I can remember the signa-
tures in my high school yearbook,
too  everyone wrote things about
my becoming a writer.”

Yet the next year Blaise entered
Denison University as a science
major and resisted his “calling” until
his senior year. “I won all the writing
awards as a geology major,” Blaise

rode a bus with a woman clad in a
leopard-skin coat. “She cursed me
from East Liberty to downtown.
‘What kind ofa man was I, and who
was I trying to impress?’ I just
whipped out my paper and read it
the whole trip,” Robbins said,
Incidentally, Robbins has had to
wear a coat on three separate occa-
sions since about I977. He admits
that he wears it when the tempera-
ture drops far below zero.

said. He went on to the University of
Iowa to obtain a master of ﬁne arts
degree but paid for his first year of
graduate school with a geology
assistantship.

Seven novels and over 50 short
stories later, Blaise lives in Iowa and
is married with two children. His
horizons have expanded to include
more ofthe literary world. Blaise has
published translations, reviews, crit-
icism, travel, sports and film articles
in American and Canadianjournals,
and is at work on “Embassy,” a spy
novel set in the West Indies.

The reading will be held at 8 p.m.
on Wednesday night in Room 501,
Cathedral of Learning. The focus,
Blaise said, will be on small pans oi"
his novels that are set in Pittsburgh,
or a short story about the city that
“no one has heard yet.” Blaise will
conduct a workshop at Carnegie-
Mellon University at I p.m. the fol-
lowing day.

Blaise has returned to Pittsburgh
only once in the last 23 years and is
excited about his visit. “I’m looking
forward to coming a day early 
hoping to see some old friends," he
said. “I’ve had great experiences in
Pittsburgh. It’s the only American
city that I know really well.”

   To The University

Simplicity is the truest form of all things. Unfortu-

’ nately for truth, our “advanced” modern world has

cast simplicity into the dustbin. The man or woman
who is able to remain childlike even through the
rigors of aging — not caring what the world says or
makes of his or her simple ways —— is called childish
and is ignored or censored. A few look on this with
sadness and shake their heads but are themselves too
complicated, too much caring of what the fellow
next door will say, to call a lie a lie and speak the
truth with a loud voice.

How different the face of things would be if every-
one told the truth always, with no fear of punish-
ment or ridicule. There is no doubt that nearly every
institution that now stands strong and towering in
the minds of modern men would crumble like a
castle of ‘sand. But there is little chance that that will

I happen soon, for even the most honest of men are

only half honest. How many times does a man see a
crime about which he never tells the police? How
many times does an employee do something that is in
opposition to his ethics and explain it away by say-
ing, “It’s just my job — I only do whatI’m told”?

Can anyone think that a quick rationalization will
make a sin virtuous? Experience tells us yes, so much
have we complicated our lives. Not only can we lie,
but we can shout a lie at the top of our voices and feel
proud and strong. The vigor of our display of force
and the loudness with which we shout are propor-
tional to our desire to convince ourselves and the
world of our goodness. Inevitably, though, a

whisper tugs at the back of our minds and makes it .

difficult to sleep at night. The whisper is the simple
truth. If a man lives simply, the truth will never
disturb his sleep, for he has no ghost to haunt him,

‘ no tracks to worry about covering and no enemy to

hurt him.

A simple man is an honest man, and an honest
man has no use for oppression and need not fear
being oppressed.

Letters to  

Rubbish

The intellectual bankruptcy of the
editorial board of The Pitt News is
something to which I thought I had
become accustomed, but then I read
“War to End All Life” in the Feb. 4
issue.

In the editorial, the board
members expressed their puzzle-
ment at the fact that the Reagan
Administration refuses to promise
that the United States will not be the
first to use nuclear weapons in the
event of a war. If such a promise
were in place, how, may I ask, would
Western Europe be defended against
the Soviet Union’s awesome conven-
tional advantages? It is precisely our
ability to use nuclear weapons to
halt an invasion of the West that
provides Europe with its defense. .

The board members were not con-
tent merely to disagree with our
president, however. They found it
necessary to impugn his character.
“A man so filled with malice or pride
(or, to give the president the benefit
of the doubt, lunacy) has no place in
the responsible position in which
Mr. Reagan finds himself.”

It is hard to take such a statement
seriously when one recalls the dire
situation our beloved country was in
only four short years ago.
Moreover, this statement represents
an insult to the 60 percent of the
voting public which, having expe-
rienced the progress made. under
Reagan’s leadership, sent him back
to the White House for a second
term.

It is truly sad that thinking people
could write such rubbish this far into
Reagan's term of office. I thank God
that the vast majority of the Ameri-
can people are so much more intelli-
gent than the hysterical types who
write editorials for The Pitt News.

Fact false

Especially since the city’s daily
newspapers did not carry the story,l
was pleased to read Bryan Lee's
account of Fr. Daniel Berrigan‘s
poetry reading at Carlow College in
your Feb. 4 issue (“Agitator Dis-
rupts Merton Celebration").

However, Mr. Lee’s article was
both false and prejudicial when it
described Fr. Berrigan as a
“defrocked Jesuit priest.”

Berrigan is indeed a Jesuit priest
but he is not now, nor has he ever

_ been, “defrocked." He is a member

of the Society of Jesus in good
standing with his clerical order, his
church and his God.

To carelessly label him as
“defrocked” not only indicates a
journalistic sloppiness with the
facts, but also conveys a subtly nega-
tive political message as well: that
this priest’s views on peace and war,
God and humanity, are rejected by
his order and his church that he and
his views are outcast.

This has never been the case, even
in the lonely days when Fr. Berrigan
and a handful of others went to pri-
son because of their opposition to
the Vietnam War. Even then Fr.
Berrigan’s books, such as “They Call
Us Dead Men: Reflections on Life

Mismanagement

As a relatively new member of the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine community, I find appal-
ling the misuse ofuniversity facilities
and funds that is evident throughout
Pitt._ On several occasions in the past
month, 1, in the company of several
graduate friends, attempted to use
the indoor track at Trees Hall.

During each of these episodes,
there were many high school and
junior high school age kids using the
facilities. We were told that the track
was being used by the New Image
Track Club and that we were not
permitted to use it. On further inves-
tigation, it became evident that the
club was private, not associated with
the university, and it did not pay for
its use ofthe facilities. While 1 do not
mind sharing the track with the
younger, non-university associated
people, 1 find it especially irritating
that they could use the facilities,
while my friends, some ofwhom pay
over $15,000 a year in tuition, and I,
were not onlysbarred from the track

,.‘::;~_:j-,g;.- - . . t . . . . i . , _ , ,,

during their daily practice session
but contributed financially to their

recreation. In my judgment, this is’

an example of mismanagement of
university funds and facilities.

It’s a trap

This letter is a response to the arti-
cle “War to End All Life,” The Pitt
News, Feb. 4. The question posed
was why the Reagan administration

,did not enter into an agreement with

the Soviets which stated that neither
side would be the first to use nuclear
missiles against each other.

Before someone writes such an
article, which defames our president
and his foreign policy, they should
open their eyes to the political arena
and realize the complex “chess.
game” that is constantly going on.
Has the person who wrote that arti-
cle ever thought of why the Soviet
Union would desire such a promise
from the United States? Probably
not. Instead, this person is the type
whom the Soviets strive to influence:
the ignorant people who accept their
propaganda at face value and refuse
to read between the lines.

Following World War II the
Soviets have been constantly
expanding into neighboring coun-
tries, occupying them and depriving
those people of the freedoms that
they had previously enjoyed. The
Soviets desire to do the same thing
to neighboring western Europe but
are stopped by just one thing: the
United States and its nuclear arse-
nal. The current administration real-
izes this, and sees the Soviet
proposal as a trap which the Rus-
sians are ready to slam shut as soon
as we take the bait.

Our current president does not
wish to have a nuclear war. Instead,
he wants to threaten the use of a
nuclear war in order to prevent one.
The Russians realize the potential
destruction that would be involved
and will therefore be deterred from
invading any of the United States’
vital interests. The deterrent effect
will continue to work only as long as
the Russians believe that we, as a
country, will promptly retaliate with
nuclear weapons if any of our vital
interests are threatened. This policy
which President Reagan supports is
called “Peace through Strength.”

Due to these reasons, 1 believe
that President Reagan is acting in
our national self-interest by refusing
to take part in a bilateral agreement
that would prohibit the United
States from using its nuclear wea-
pons first.

From the Foul Line / Mark A. Sindler

At a glance, the only contrast
between Mr. Douglas A. Hibbs Jr.
and Mr. P. J. Whoopee —— the gray-
ing professor prodigy of Tennessee
Tuxedo fame — is the age gap.

Other attributes are immaterial,
for passion never knew any bounds.
Hibbs, 40, a tenured professor of
government at Harvard, stepped

down from his position six days ago.

after a female seminar student
waged a sexual harassment com-
plaint against him. The resignation
symbolizes some pretty heavy stuff,
for several reasons.

Administration bigwigs in Cam-
bridge believe that this is the first
time in the university’s 348-year his-
tory that charges of sexual harass-
ment have forced a promiscuous
professor to leave his faculty post.

Tenure appointment at Harvard —
which Hibbs attained — translates
into employment for life. This is the

third time in six years that both stu- ‘
‘ dents and faculty members have

filed such official complaints. A con-
certed effort is being made to halt
any further sexual activity in a for-
mal academic setting.

Not least of all, a Harvard survey
two years ago revealed that 41 per-
cent of graduate students, 34 percent
of undergraduates and 49 percent of
non-tenured faculty had faced vary-
ing charges of sexual harassment.

Current indications -reveal that
Harvard’s social setting may deteri-
orate even further. They'll be mak-

tuition beyond contemplated lev-
els.” He stated that the administra-
tion will examine every possible
alternative before presenting a
budget to the university board this_
summer. Freeman added to this that
it is too early to project what the
governor’s proposal will mean in
terms of speciﬁc cuts or tuition
increases.

One positive aspect of the gover-
nor’s proposal, according to Posvar,
is a 33-percent increase in funding to
the Ben Franklin Partnership. This
means a proposed appropriation of
$25.2 million to the organization.

The Ben Franklin Partnership is a
major source of funding for the
Western Pennsylvania Advanced
Technology Center, of which Pitt is
a founding member.

Finally, the governor’s proposal
earmarks $1 million for the planned
“University of Pittsburgh Research
Development Center." The center is
to be located in the former Gulf
Research Center at Harmarville.
Posvar said the university is cur-
rently negotiating with Chevron Oil
(which took over Gulf Oil several
months ago) and other sectors of the
Harmarville community.

(UPI) —— He’s one of the most
wanted men in the world. And
the latest word on the “angel of
death” of the Nazi death camp of
Auschwitz is that he is moving in
high circles in Paraguay.

An Israeli Nazi hunter said
yesterday that Dr. Josef Mengele
has been reported to be serving
as a personal physician to Para-
guayan President Alfredo
Stroessner.

In Tel Aviv, Tuvia Friedman
said the report came from a West
German teacher who returned
from‘ Paraguay one month ago.
Friedman said he will go to
Rome next month to join other
holocaust survivors trying to
persuade Pope John Paul to ask
Stroessner to extradite Mengele.

Hundreds of Auschwitz survi-
vors have named Mengele as the
deadly doctor who sentenced pri-
soners to the gas chamber or to
slave labor with a ﬂick of his
thumb or a wave of his cane. He's
accused of conducting unspeaka-
bly cruel experiments on thou-
sands of prisoners in his
obsession to create‘ a race of
blond, blue-eyed children.

There is a price of nearly
$400,000 on his head, and the
United States has joined Israel
and West Germany in trying to
track him down. If still alive,

In Brief-——

Mengele would be nearly 74
years old.

John Loftus, a former U.S.
Justice Department investigator,
said Nazi war criminal Josef
Mengele is alive, but not in Para-
guay, where some Nazi hunters
have been searching for him.
Loftus said his “best informa-
tion" shows Mengele is on the
move traveling between Chile,
Argentina and Uraguay. But the
Sunday Times of London
claimed Mengele is living “fairly
openly” in Paraguay, quoting a
Paraguayan political exile living
in Argentina.

(UPI) —~ A twin engine plane
carrying a critically ill patient to
a hospital crashed and exploded
in Medford, Ore., on Saturday.”
All four people aboard died.
Authorities said the crash
occurred as the plane
approached the Medford-
Jackson County Airport for a
landing. Among those killed
were the pilot and the founder of
Mercy Flights, a non-profit
ambulance service. Witnesses
said the plane appeared to be try-

ing to avoid hitting several trailer

homes when it crashed.

The Pitt Panthers dropped to 0-4
in the Eastern Wrestling League,
now 6-5 overall, as they lost to rivals
Lock Haven on Friday evening 37-7
and Penn State 35-9 on Saturday
afternoon. However, Pitt still leads
the Lock Haven series, 5-4-l, while
Penn State has extended its lead to
33-9-2 over Pitt.

“If you’re going to get beat, you
like to go down swinging; against
Lock Haven, wejust let them beat us
because we lacked intensity and
fire," said head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “But fortunately against
Penn State, we could be happy with
the team’s determination.

“Friday night during4Lock Ha-
ven’s match, each individual was
worried about making weight for the
match against Penn State but Satur-
day they all pulled together, and it
was a total team effort."

Panther freshman Joe Iagnema
(H8 lbs.) was defeated by Lock Ha-
ven’s Dicky Howell, who recorded a
technical fall over Iagnema with a
time of 3:33. Then again at Satur-
day’s match, Penn State’s Ken Cher-

Wrestlers lose two, fall to 0-4 in EWL

tow beat Iagnema by a technical fall
when Chertow was awarded a point
for riding time advantage at the end
of the match.

At I26 lbs., sophomore John
Hnath recorded a victory on Friday
against Jeff Husick. Hnath was
awarded a major decision when he
gained two additional points
through a takedown with only 13
seconds remaining, thus raising the
final score to 14-6. However, despite
a commendable effort, Hnath was
defeated by Nittany Lion Tim Flynn
for the third time this season. With
his tremendous fire and intensity,
Hnath brought the crowd to life, yet
his efforts were unsuccessful as he
fell to Flynn 7-4.

Friday evenings upset came when
Lock Haven’s Metzger (I34 lbs.)
halted Kyle Nellis’ winning streak by
handing him his first loss in 10
matches. Metzger attacked Nellis
fiercely after his big win on Wendes-
day evening when he defeated

Bloomsburg’s Jon Moser. Metzger
was able to take away Nellis‘ offense
and won 8-6. Against Penn State,
however, Nellis rebounded with a
major decision over senior Scott
Webster. Nellis was looking forward
to a key match against Penn State’s
John Manotti; however, Manotti
was replaced by Webster due to an
injury.

Making his season wrestling
debut, sophomore Mike Capazzoli
fell to Lock Haven‘s Torn Kraemer
by a technical fall in the second
period. Capozzoli ( 142 lbs.) replaced
an injured Steve Frank,~who is out
of the Panther lineup due to an
injury sustained in last Saturday's
Navy match.

Rich Esswein also debuted at 142
lbs. because the coaches thought
that Esswein’s mat style would bet-
ter match PSU’s Gary Kaschak. Ess-
wein gave a fine showing but
disappointingly fell short as he ran
out of time. With only seconds

remaining in the match, Esswein
controlled his opponent but was
unable to rack back points and sub-
sequently lost 5-3. “Rich has a differ-
ent style, but that allows him to do
what he did today," said Stottle-
myer. “He’s able to show his
strengths  but today he just didn’t
have enough power. Rich is an engi-
neering student and thus is forced to
give up practice time that would
build his stamina.”

Junior Gary Bolin (150 lbs.) was
the only Panther to record victories
both days. Lock Haven’s Dave Tog-
gas gave Bolin a struggle — it was
almost four-and-a-half minutes into
the match before either opponent
scored. Toggas fell to Bolin 8-5.
Bolin recorded a superior decision
over Lion Glenn Koser with a score
of 17-3. Bolin is currently tied for
eighth among the league’s top scor-
ers and has extended his individual
record to 17-7.

page 7

Panther Joe Bond (158 lbs.) suf-
fered a disappointing knee injury
and was forced to default against
Eagle Bryon Benner with only 36
seconds left in the match. Bond was
injured with only 10 seconds gone in
the first period, then again in the
second period, but he insisted on
continuing until Stottlemyer
stopped the match in Bond's best
interests. “Benner jammed my knee
into the mat early into the match,”
said Bond. “And later, when he had
it up high, he cranked it. I was hesit-
ant to stop because I wanted to do
my part for the team,” he continued.
“I thought I could finish, but I guess
it’S better that I didn‘t.’’

Senior Greg Dille replaced Bond

against Penn State's All-America,
Chris Bevilacqua. Dille had his work ’

cut out for him and despite his deter-
mined fight, his opponent was able
to rack the points and record a tech-
nical fall with a time of 3:15.

Gymnasts lose to Indiana State

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
traveled to Indiana State on Satur-

day and equaled their best score of .

the season with a 267. However,
their best was not good enough as
the Sycamores set their all-time
school record by compiling an
incredible 275 points — generally
considered a brilliant score.

The Panthers were again'short-
handed, this time lacking the talent
of sophomore Kevin Garren, who
was sidelined with leg problems.

“Kevin could have helped us a lot
on our floor exercises,” commented
junior Mark Klafter. “Our overall
score would have improved because
we usually win on the ﬂoor.”

Although Pittcame up short here,
Klafter took first in the individual
ﬂoor routine with a 9.65. Freshman
standout Jorge Sanchez placed first
on the vault with junior All-East
Matt Peters scoring first on the high
bars. Klafter and Peters led all
Panthers with a ‘combined score of
-55.2, followed by Sanchez who just

missed the 53-point mark. '

Pitt started the season with an
inconsistency in hitting their rou-
tines. This problem has been the one
point the Panthers have concen-
trated on all season.

“We have been shooting for this
improvement all year,” agreed Klaf-
ter. “Because of our recent success,
we’re going to try to step up our
routines in terms of difficulty.”

In terms of effort, this meet was
definitely Pitt’s best yet. Nearly
every gymnast scored points. Stand-
outs included junior Marty Comini
in the floor routine, senior Ed Miller
on the rings and high bar, and
sophomore Mike Mealie on the
pommel horse. .

Said fellow teammate Mark Klaf-
ter on his performance: “Mike has
always had great potential on the
horse. Now he’s ﬁnally achieving it.”

The pommel horse was indeed a
key factor in the ﬁnal results, as a
43.9 team score was Pitt's best effort
yet this season.

Indiana State has always been
strong in gymnastics, turning out
such household names as Kurt Tho-
mas. “They really surprised me in
the warm-ups,” said Peters. “I never
realized they were that good. We just
went out there and did our best."

WERE THE
TECHNOLOGY
FORCE.

FORCE

One of the reasons for the Syca-
mores’ strength lies in their team
depth. By taking their top gymnasts
and utilizing them in only three or
four events, their talent was spread
out during the meet. They then
relied on their depth to carry them
through.

The four judges kept consistency
throughout the meet, though Klafter
complained that the “one-tenth”
rule was in effect.

“This merely means that the home
team [the Sycamores] gets a tenth of
a point more than they deserve. By
no means were the judges generous
with us.”

Thejudging did not effect Klafter,
who hasn’t been defeated on the
floor exercise since 1983 and will
attempt to win All-East honors
again this year. ‘‘I think I did pretty
good. Ability-wise, I‘m right wherel
was last season, usually scoring
around 55,” he stated. “After I
regain more consistency, Ill be mov-
ing on to newer things  I’m still not
100 percent after my injury.”

Klafter’s strength is improving
gradually, as shown in his tie for first
on the floor routine with Indiana
State’s Carlos Silvestre (both had
scores of 9.65). Silvestre made
nationals last year.

Hockey team beats Duquesne

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club
acquired two additional victories
this weekend by dethroning the
Duquesne Dukes 6-3 Saturday and
shutting out Allegheny Sunday 4-0.
The Panthers record now stands at
13-2-1.

Duquesne handed the Panthers a
6-3 loss earlier in the season and the
Pitt skaters refused to allow the
Dukes to do the same this time. The
Panthers outshot Duquesne 40-28
and demolished the Dukes’ pre-
viously undefeated season.

“Everyone just played excellent.
Nobody played bad,” commented
left wing Jim Owens Jr. “We played
with a ton of intensity. Duquesne
was stunned because they couldn’t

. get out of their end.”

The first period was scoreless as
both goalies worked to deny their
opponent. “We were moving real
good for once. We started the first
period real strong,” said defenseman
John Pettit. “We had a couple of
opportunities to score in the begin-
ning but we didn’t take advantage of
them. But we were all pretty up for
this game and we kept it going
strong the whole time.”

Right wing Pete Barbara played
his first league game for the Pan-
thers on Saturday and was a tremen-
dous scoring asset for the team.
Barbara came up with two goals and
two assists for the Panthers in the

second period. This period ended in

a 5-3 Panther lead which Duquesne
was unable to narrow. In the third
period, Barbara scored an addi-
tional insurance goal, giving himself
a hat trick and securing the win for
the Panthers.

“My first two goals were pretty
much defensive mistakes on
Duquesne’s part. We played well as
a unit. It was the forechecking that
helped us.” said Barbara.

Other bright spots for the Pan-
thers came from Owens — one goal
and three assists — and center Jeff

Bele — one goal and four assists.
“The presence of Pete Barbara made
a big difference. We play well
together; Me and Pete played
hockey together at Bethel Park High
School. We just proved we were the
better team on Saturday,” said Bele.

Goalie John Godwin did another
incredible job of defending the
Panther net by saving 37 of the 40
shots fired at him by the Dukes.
Godwin, who also tended goal in the
previous“ battle with Duquesne
called the rivalry “easier than the last
time. I told the guys they owed me
one because I played my lungs out
last time when we lost. We were
physically abusing Duquesne. We
know now that we can beat them
every time we play them. We beat
them up and down the ice every
time. Definitely man for man, we
have the best talent in the league.
When we play as a team, nobody can
beat us,” said Godwin.

Yesterday the Panthers managed
to obtain their first shutout of the
season by defeating Allegheny 4-0.
The Panthers, although tired from
the Duquesne game, took control of
the puck and outshot Allegheny 38-
20 on the Gators home ice in
Meadville.

“The defense was happy with the
shutout,” said defenseman Bill Ki-

cinski. “It was not a really well-
played game but we did what we had
to do to win.”

Godwin was also tending goal for
this Panther shutout. “Allegheny
got a lot better since the last time we
played them,” said Godwin, who
stopped 38 shots yesterday.

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club will
be returning to Meadville Wednes-
day to meet with Slippery Rock
before attempting to gain revenge on
Gannon next Monday. Gannon is
the only team which the Panthers
have not defeated yet this season.
“We already paid back Duquesne,
now we want Gannon,” said
Kicinski.

Pitt breaks 3-gameskid

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Pitt women’s basketball coach
Judy Saurer may not have been
overly impressed on how it was
done, but as she said following her
team’s 96-84 victory over Duquesne
on Saturday, “A win is a win.”

It is indeed. Saurer’s squad ended
a three-game losing streak as three
players scored over 20 points.

Leading the way was Jennifer
Bruce, (Who else?) who fired in 24
points and grabbed 10 rebounds.
Bruce was joined by Lisa Fubio,
who scored 22, and Stephanie Col-
lins, who was good for 20.

Collins, a senior from Gaithers-
burg, Md., was perhaps the most
impressive as she hit on eight of nine
shots from the field, all from the
deep perimeter. “Stephanie played
very well,” agreed Saurer.

Collins, a pure shooter, explained
the key to her success: “I’ve been
working on [my shot] for about a
month, going up, [to the field house]
and shooting around.” That work
paid off Saturday.

Although only a 12-point victory
for Pitt, the game was never very
close. Pitt led by 11 atthe half and by
22 at one point during the second
half, but turnovers, of which Pitt
had 29, kept Duquesne within strik-
ing distance.

Duquesne had five players in dou- .

ble figures, including Maureen
Major, who tossed in 21 off the
bench. But it wasn’t enough to keep
their five-game winning streak alive.
The Duchesses dropped to 13-10
overall while Pitt upped its record to
an identical 13-l0.

Pitt will play the second game. of
its three-game homestand on Wed-
nesday night when they host Seton
Hall at 5:30 p.m. Seton Hall upset
Syracuse last Wednesday night at
Manley Field House in Syracuse,

CM HEA

and Saurer expects them to give Pitt
a run also.

“We beat them by about 20 at
Seton Hall," said Saurer, “and that
really turned us around, but they are
gonna come in here ready to play."

Collins agreed. “They are gonna
be psyched and ready to play.“

Pitt will look for Kim Tirik to
continue to play as well as she has at
times this year. Tirik played the
game of her life against Penn State
last Monday night and came back to
dish out 12 assists against Duquesne
on Saturday. lfTirik keeps her turn-
overs down, Pitt could explode.

After Seton Hall, Pitt hosts Bos-
ton College on Saturday at 4 p.m.,
then goes back on the road to St.
John’s ‘on Feb. 20.

Game Notes: Pitt shot 72 percent
from the field in the second half and

prompted Saurer to comment, ‘‘I
don’t think l’ve ever had a team
shoot like that.”  Everyone on the
Pitt squad played, including sopho-
more Pam Novosel who is suffering
from a bad chest cold and will be
X-rayed for pneumonia Monday 
The Big East Tournament will be
played Feb. 28-March 2 at Manley
Field House in Syracuse. Pitt can be
seeded as high as second or a low as
sixth, depending on how they fare
these next few weeks.

Panthers defeat Marshall

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team ended their dual
meet season on a positive note
when they defeated Marshall
Saturday at Trees Pool.

‘‘It wasn’t a real big meet for
us,” said senior co-captain Geoff
Emore, “but it was a good way to
end the dual meet season.”

The victory was the last dual
meet of Emore’s college career.
He contributed three first-place
scores — in the medley relay,
200-meter individual medley and
the 200-meter backstroke. F

The diving team had a success-
ful meet, taking the top spots on
both boards. Junior Todd
Mulzet took first place on both
boards, while junior Mark

McCormick took second place
on both the three-meter and one-
meter boards, but a team is only
allowed to take the top two pla-
ces on either board so third place
went to Marshall.

The Panthers will be entering
the championship half ofthe sea-
son with a record of 7-2. Accord-
ing to Emore, the team will begin
their tapering process over the
next few weeks, in preparation
for the Big East Championship
Feb. 28-March 2.

“The tapering will begin for us
next week. We’ll be doing more
sprinting than usual and after
this week, we’ll cut out the morn-
ing practices,” Emore said.

According to Mulzet, the div-
ers will be following a slightly
different schedule in preparing
for the championship meets.

“We’ll begin tapering after the
Big East and Eastern Champion-
ships.” he said.

Pitt depth shows

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

Notations in the record book had
to be delayed until about 10 p.m.
Saturday. Earlier in the day, the
Panthers engineered an 80-68 win
over Seton Hall in a manner unex-
pected but necessary if Pitt is to ﬁn-
ish the year with dignity.

It wasn‘t until the late evening
hours —- Georgetown having beaten
Boston College 78-68 — that the
Panthers (14-7, 5-5) ascended to
ﬁfth place in the Big East. Never
before have they been so lofty this
far into the season.

Then again, never until this sea-
son had Pitt built an impregnable
lead as it head two days ago at Fitz-
gerald Field House. Before Boston
College dropped to 5-6 and sixth
place, quick fouls assessed the big
men in Coach Roy Chipman’s front-
court forced his hand.

With three fouls apiece 11:50 into
the game, 6-9 center Keith Arm-
strong and 6-10 forward Charles
Smith were waved to the bench,
scoreless, no less, until the second
half. In their place appeared such
obscure talent as Matt Miklasevich
and Marlon Ferguson.

“Our bench played very well,”
Chipman said later, adding, ‘You
have to be pleased with the way it
played."

That the Pitt bench amassed 30
points while the regulars sat hap-
pened at a" time when the Panthers
need more than five-man depth to
secure the fifth-place slot — at a time

when four games against the confer-
ence heavies still remain.

Most impressive was Ferguson,
whose 18 minutes were the strongest
of his two-year Pitt career, one that
has been marked more by jitters
than by jumpshots.

“At the beginning of the season I
was tight," said Ferguson, whose
mid-October ﬂu slowed needed pro-
gress. “Any time I stepped on the
floor I tried to do everything per-
fectly. Now I’m more relaxed."

While he spelled Smith (only four
points), Miklasevich filled the cavity
created by Armstrong’s (also four)
absence. “Because the starters were
playing really well — four games in
seven days — this was a letdown.
When [reserves] get the opportunity
to play, you perform and we pulled it
out,” said Miklasevich, who scored
nine points in 13 second-half
minutes.

The score knotted at 19, the
Panthers jumped out to a 31-22 lead
four minutes before the half. It was
all the Pirates needed, though, as
junior forward Andre McCloud
scored 15 of his 25 points in the first
half, trimming the lead to 34-32.

Curtis Aiken, for the second
straight game, set a career high with
24 points, 13 of those coming in the
first half. He emerged as the only
productive regular.

“Our second unit is very competi-
tive. When we practice, it isn’t like
they’re going through the motions.
If they [continue to] play as tough as
today, our starting jobs are in trou-
ble,” Aiken said. _

Other subs who turned in typi-
cally supportive roles were Joey
David (eight points) and Darryl

Ciymnasts finish second

at New Hampshire meet

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

DURHAM; N.H. — The free ice
cream given out by the New Hamp-
shire Dairy Council to fans and
gymnasts following Saturday’s meet
here was good, but for the Pitt
women’s gymnastics team a victory
would have been even better.

Not that the Lady Panthers didn’t
have a good day — they finished
second (172.35) behind hometown
New Hampshire (177.1) in a four-
team meet — it’s just that the squad
was in the meet all the way and a
first-place finish was never out of
reach. And one wonders what the
result would have been if the injury-
riddled team had been healthy.

“I was happy with the way we per-
formed here today,” said head coach
Donna Sanft. “We had a rough week
in practice and a rough warm-up,
but we didn’t let it hurt us.”

Sanft had a good deal to be satis-
tied with. Several individuals placed

among the meet leaders in the four‘

events and the all-around. Alisa
Spector finished third in the all-

around, a compilation of a gym-
nasts’ scores in all of the four events,
with a score of 35.6. Two Pitt gym-
nasts, Spector and Beth Waters, fin-
ished tied for first on the uneven
parallel bars.

The one event that the Lady
Panthers have had the most trouble
with this season, the ﬂoor exercise,
wound up being the one that Pitt
had the most success with Saturday.

“It was by far our best meet of the
year for the floor,” said Sanft.
“We’ve been spending a lot of time
on that in practice lately and I guess
it paid off today.” On the floor exer-
cise Spector again was among the
leaders, placing second, and Kim
Calderone finished in a tie for third.

The first event set the pattern that
would continue all day -— New
Hampshire had the lead and Pitt was
a close second, 44.8-44.6. North
Carolina State was a distant fourth,
a position they would occupy all
day, while pre-meet favorite Denver
was a disappointing third, some-
thing that had Sanft wondering. “I
was surprised by Denver's finish. I
thought they would be stronger than

‘n ' n
Shepherd (ﬁves
rebounds).

Tainting the rise of Pitt reserves
were the 57 fouls both teams accum-
ulated, including the Panthers’ 13 of
the 33 in the second half.

The Panthers were up by 16 with
6:08 to go before five fouls were
committed. Unnecessary, Chipman
called -them: “That’s something we
were disappointed with. We should
have tucked it away at that point.”

Later Chipman retracted. “When
they fall behind, [Coach P.J.] Carle-
simo has them playing aggressively.

.And we’re not the smartest team

when it comes to fouling. I’m just
disappointed they were all on the
same guy,” he said, referring to the
six leading to Smith’s and Arm-
strong’s benching.

Off The Boards: Five Seton Hall
players fouled out, joined by
Armstrong.

Saturday’s game could mark the
start of Ferguson’s renaissance.
Hampered with a flu bug before fall
practice began, his first honest chan-
ces haven’t come until just earlier
this month.

“He was a young guy trying to
find a place on the basketball team,”
Chipman said. “lt’s difficult to miss
those things we teach early. When he
got back, he was catching up. Now
he’s past that and is beginning to
displace some players.”

The Panthers shot 43 percent
from the floor to Seton Ha1l’s 44.
Both teams shot in the 68 percent
free throw range.

Aiken’s 24-point day came on the
heels of Wednesday’s 19 against
Providence.

they were. Maybe they just had a
bad day, but I don't know what
exactly happened."

One thing that has hurt the squad
all season has been injuries. A foot
injury to Kristy Pieters hampered
her performance Saturday. “It’s a
turf-toe,” said Pieters. “I have to see
through today even though I was in‘
a lot of pain.” Pieters had a thick
bandage wrapped around her foot
and was walking on crutches. “It was
in my mind out there,” she said of
the pain, “but you try not to let it
bother you too much. But it’s there
and you know it hurts.”
know it hurts.”

It’s the type of injury that even
free ice cream can’t make better.

Track team sizzles
in Hardee’s Invite

By Rich McKenzie
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
men’s track team traveled to Mor-
gantown, W. Va._, on Saturday to
participate in the Hardee’s Invita-
tional Track Meet and came home
with five first-place finishes. The
meet welcomed 30 teams and some
of the finest athletes in the nation.

Pitt coach John Vasvary said:
“When a meet isn’t scored on a team-
wide basis, the best way to judge
one’s success is through first-place
finishes; and with the number of
first-place finishes as we did, I’d defi-
nitely say that it was a successful
meet for the team.”

One of the team‘s wins came from
Panther Lee McRae, who has lost
only one dash this entire season. He
broke the Mountaineer Field House
record (which he had set one week
earlier) in the 55-meter dash with a
time 6.17 seconds, which was good
enough to qualify him for the IC4As
as well as the NCAAs. Vasvary said
of his freshman from Pembroke,
N.C., “Lee has great lift and
acceleration.”

Other first-place finishers for Pitt
were Jesse Mikell in the 400-meters
with a time of 49.88 and the shuttle
hurdle relay, one-mile and two-mile

relay teams. The shuttle hurdle relay
team of Darren Rogers, Shane
Saunders, Jason Harris and Calvin
Holmes won the 4x55-meter race
with a time of 29.3, which is one-
tenth of a second off the Pitt record.

In the two-mile relay, Mickey
Rihtarchik, Scott Abel, Bob Weiner
and Rodney Giles combined for a
first-place finish, while the team of
McRae, Dorell Hilliman, Rogers
Thomas and Mikell combined to
win the relay.

Thomas qualified for the IC4As in .

the 55-meters with a time of 6.48,
even though he failed to place in the
race. In the 55-meter hurdles,
Holmes and Harris finished second
and fourth with times of 7.35 and
7.61, respectively. Holmes’ time
qualified him for the IC4As. Hilli-
man finished second behind Mikell
in the 400-meters with a time of
50.13. In the 500-meters, Giles ﬁn-
ished third with a time of 1:06.78,
while Weiner and Abel were finish‘-
ing second and third in the 1,000-
meters with times of 2:29.66 and
2:32.00, respectively. In the 1,500-
meters, Joe‘Daniels finished fourth

at 4:02.20, while Ken Picciano ran to A

a sixth-place finish with a time of
4204.06.

The Big East track championships
will be held Feb. 16-17 at Syracuse.
On Feb. 22, the TAC Nationals take
place in Madison Square Garden.
