‘Zoology Students Would Be Aided
By Zoo Improvement’--Dr. Williams

 

The plan for the rehabilitation of
the Highland Park zoo proposed by
Mayor William N. McNair’s newly ap-
pointed special zoo committee should
be a matter of concern to University
students, according to Dr. S. H. Wil-
liams, professor of zoology in the Uni-
versity and a. member of the commit-
tee, The convenience of the zoo to
the University in regard to nearness
and to adequate facilities for study
would make it an ideal place to hold
classes in zoology and other natural
sciences, he states.

Dr. Williams and the other mem-
bers of the zoo committee join in con-
demning the Highland Park zoo in
its present condition, as both “in-
adequate and inhumane.” After a
thorough inspection of the zoo, they
drew up, and put on ﬁle before the
City Council, a report of their recom-
mendations. Architectural plans were
drawn for remodeling the zoo and im-
proving the display facilities. Im-
proved sanitary conditions, construc-
tion of a spacious monkey island and

Ferguson Calls Student
Autobiographies ‘Sacred’

Every student in the economics
classes of Dr. John M. Ferguson, as-
sistant professor of economics, is re-
quested to write an autobiography for
the enlightenment of the professor.
But these will not be mimeographed,
‘as erroneously stated in last week’s
Pitt News, because, as Dr. Ferguson
puts it, “They are sacred."

Instead, he will have copies of the
class roll mimeographed so that the
students may become better ac-
quainted.

a. new open air dens for bears and
lions, additional space for other ani-
mals, and a general rehabilitation of
enclosures, were recommended, For
these improvements, the committee
advised an expenditure of $114,000.

The zoo committee also suggested
the establishment of a permanent
zoological 2-ociety. This group would
foster gifts of money and aid in ex-
changing exhibits with ether zoos.
Davis C. Burroughs, chairman, pledg-
ed the aid of the committee in or-
ganizing the society, should council
approve the program.

Dr. Williams, a member of the
State Game commission, said the
State would provide Pennsylvania

animals, and Dr. A. VV. Henri, secre-
tary of the zoo committee, gave as-
surances of similar help from the
Izaak Walton league and the Audu-
bon society.

Adult education on next Monday even-
ing, at 8 o’clock, in the Carnegie Lec-
ture hall. Lyman B1‘-yson, visiting
professor of education at Teachers’

the discussion.

The meeting will be the ﬁrst in a
series of forums to be held through-
out the winter. This ‘is the ﬁrst"a‘-
tempt to hold a community forum
here since the University Extension
society offered them. The present
forums will be different in that they
will cover the subject in a manner for
everyone to understand and appreci-

High School Forensic
Schedule Embraces
40,000 Students

“Forty thousand people are affected
by the Pennsylvania Forensic league
program every year,” stated C. Stan-
ton Belfour, director of extension
courses, and chairman of the Pennsyl-
vania Forensic league.

“This ﬁgure includes participants
in 49 musical and forensic events
taken from over 300 high schools all
over the state, and its effects upon
the caliber of college musicians, de-
baters, and orators is just becoming
evident in the universities "of Penn-
sylvania. As freshmen at Pitt this
year are the national champions in
original oratory; three Allegheny
county debating champions, a state
champion debater, and an Allegheny
county reading champion,” Mr. Bel-
four said.

The Forensic league intends to
sponsor two additional contests this
year, rounding out a full program of
activities

Heinz House Steps Daunt
Book Exchange Customers

,From remarks overheard on the
campus it would seem that people are
not taking full advantage of the
WSGA book exchange being operated
in its new position in Heinz House.
Although hundreds of cards have been
ﬁled both in the wanted and for sale
sections, answers have been reported
few and far between.

The book exchange, under the direc-
tion of Betty Black, C36, was original-
ly organized to avoid the confusion of
signs on the bulletin boards. It does
not attempt to handle the books
themselves, but is meant to be a clear-
ing house where one may find the
telephone number or address of the
person who has the book he wants
or wants the book he has.

Miss Lynn Smith, a member of the
famous VVomen’s Flying squadron
will be the guest speaker at the initial
meeting of the Inquiry forum which
will be held in room 107 in Alumni
hall at 12:30 o’clock today. Travel-
ing via the air the members of this
squadron have eppeared in many of
the larger cities throughout the coun-
try.

These women were picked to speak
throughout the country as represen-
tatives of the Women’s International
league for Peace and Freedom. Miss

of the Inquiry forum will be “Muni-

known educators. will attempt to
make the teacher a pioneer of a new
order rather than a conserver of the
old.

Holding as “historical fact” that for
the American people the age of indi-
vidualism is yielding to one of collec-
tivism, the journal, Dr. Counts de-
clares, “intends to go forward to meet
the new age and ma.ke the birth as

painless as possible.” Teachers, he
holds, should play an important role
in speeding the process of raising
American life “from the level of the;
profit system and vested class inter-I
ests to the plane of social motivation,
collectivism and classlessness.” They
should “look upon education as a to-
cal point in the evolution of culture.”

 

Whither Panther?

our Panther

One of the highlights at a Pitt foot-
ball game was conspicuous by its ab-
sence. The Panther, at the Pitt-W.
& J. battle, that has traditionally ap-
peared at all Pitt football games, was
not to be seen Saturday and for a
good reason. The reason being that
the small portion of the skin left by
moths was not enough to go around
a normal human collegian. The
Athletic department refused to let,
the Panther cavort unless it were ex-|
actly what the well-dressed Panther;
should wear. '

A new skin has been ordered in!
which the Panther will make his ﬁrst
home appearance at the Southern
California game on October 13. Once’
again the mascot will be displayed,
wearing a skin which will arouse the
as he romps
and plays for the amusement of the
spectators.

The Glee Club Quartet will again
have an opportunity to entertain the
freshmen. “High Barbary,” “Hunt-

Adolph Anderson. Jack Hammer-
schmidt, Cap- and Gown soloist from
last year, is also on the program.

Known only as the “Dynamite Ban-
joist,” Dr. M. A. Ignelzi, a mysterious
figure, but well known to former stu-
dents, will do things to the common

The fullest effects of this “step-up”
were felt in the real estate and build-
ing trades where the value of con-
struction contracts awarded was 119
per cent ahead of those in 1933. Trade
fo1lowed with new automobile regis-
trations showiug a 41 per cent in-
crease.

Ranging downward from ‘these two
highs are ,production, employment,
transportation and financial statistics,
all showing advances.

Perhaps the most encouraging
aspect of this report from the stand-
point of Pittsburgh industry is the
deﬁnite change for the better shown
in the production of iron, steel and
coal where steady increases up to 46
p-er cent were recorded.

Labor, it is shown, shared appre-
ciably in the beneﬁts of business re-
vival over this period. Payrolls con-
tained over 34 per cent more, and man-
hours worked were up 16 per cent
over the corresponding eight months

‘Four Horsemen’ Can Be Successfully
Attacked, Noted Economist Claims

 

By Leah Stark
“Social insurance does not pretend

to be more than a successful appar-
atus to eliminate the economic con-
sequences of the four horsemen, Ac-
cident, Death, Illness, and Unemploy-
ment. in the wage worker's life,” ac-
cording to Dr. I. M. Rubinow, member
of the Ohio commission on unemploy-
ment insurance.

Dr_ Rubinow, as guest speaker of
the Economics 121 class, a course in
labor problems, stated that al-
though unemployment is a very im-
portant labor problem today, it is not
the only one. In former years, losses
due to illness have been greater than
those caused by unemployment, he
said. “Perhaps it way be predicted
that there will always be a permanent
unemployed group of from five to ten
million.”

Dr. Rubinow, who is the author of

“The Quest of Security,” believes that;
social insurance is an effective way
of eliminating insecurity. He said,
“The kernel of it.s value lies, how-
ever, in labor itself; labor devised
the system when it banded together
in sick beneﬁt and security groups,
as a method of mutual cooperation.”
According to D1‘. Rubinow, the only
thing social legislation did was to.
compel a universal system of social"

insurance and to make the state or
nation bear a part of the cost. The bur-
den was too large for the modest wage
of the average workingman.

This exponent of social insurance
also stressed the fact that no group
is immune from insecurity, although
the wage worker has a substantial
majority of 75 per cent. The farmer
suffers from insecurity because of
overproduction of farm products; so-
ciety has no security for the middle
class or professionals who depend on
a clientele; the investor cannot be
insured against the loss of value of
his paper securities. 9

“The social insurance plan is crit-
icised on the left as not being suffi-
cient security; on the right it is said
to be unamerican. and communistic,"
Dr. Rubinow stated.

Being a resident of Ohio. Dr, Ru-

, ‘nniow is particularly interested in the
unemployment insurance plan his
commission proposed to the Ohio

state legislature. This plan would be
ﬁnanced two per cent on the employ-
er’s payroll and due per cent on the
worker’s wages, The scale of beneﬁts
would be for the ﬁrst sixteen weeks
after the ﬁrst three weeks. It would
compensate for one-ﬁth of the loss of
wages. Dr. Rubinow said, that even
in life insurance plans, the insurance
is not for 100 per cent loss.

If you want to experience the thrill
of pride, the kind that bubbles up
your throat and tickles the back of
your month, while you tingle all over;
if you want t.o become suddenly proud
of knowing a writer; if you crave the
sensation an author feels when he
first sees his brain child in print; if
you want all this in one big dose,
then get a copy of the Virginia Quart-
erly Review (one of the upper—class
magazines) for July of this year, and
read the article on books written by
Dr. W’alte.r L. Myers, of our own
English department.

“Life, Literature, and Books” is the
title of the article, in which Dr.
Myers reviews four recent novels,
with a zest and spirit and flashes of
wit that will register with you. Read
it and then say to anyone near you,
"See that? One of my profs!”

And when you read it the second
time, notice carefully: here is what
the whole English department means
by style; here is what any instructor
would accept as a book report; here
is life, literature, and four books, all
neatly explained in seven bright
pages.

II: * 1!:

ET’S DVVELL FOR a moment on
two or more writers in our fac-
ulty. Dr. Benjamin H. Williams,
-polysigher, is working on another
"textbook on international relations.
His last book, “The United States and

1DisarmamenL” is already widely used

-as a textbook.

Dr. N. A. N. Cleven, of the history
department, is also working on a
text, one to cover the history of Amer-
:ican—Hispanic relations. “Still,” he
says, “that's nothing particularly
new, Practically every instructor is
at least thinking of a textbook_ I
am in the middle of at least six, my-
self. I never seem to ﬁnish them.”
But he admitted that this one ought
to be out around Chirstmas time.

Dr. Cleven just added two more
eagle feathers to his educational war-
bonnet recently. His name appears
in the 1934-5 issue of “Who’s Who in
America”’for the one; along with
Sam (Zoo) Williams, Chester (Get-a-
degree) Buckner, and Bill (News-
papcrman) Maulsby; the other, an
article on Andre Santa Cruz, the B0-
livian mestizo who dreamed in vain of
a united Spanish America, was publish-
ed in the latest encyclopedia to crash
the intellectual frontier, “’I‘he Encyclo-
pedia of the Social Sciences” which
is being issued volume by volume, has
reached its thirteenth tome, and is
only on the 'l"s. It boasts the work
of many great teachers, and already,
despite its incomplete form, has been
widely acclaimed. Dr. C1even's con-
tribution ranks him as a contribut-
ing editor of the ﬁnest publication of
late years.

i i t
Hey Jeff! , . .

Some of you may be having difficul-
ty with Master Chaucer’s erudite
Words. If you are still struggling
with the prologue you may be glad
to learn that the U. library has a few
books that will aid you.

There is a translation “on reserve”
by Frank Ernest Hill, including the
prologue, and the Tales of the Nun’s
Priest (Remember Chanticleer?,) the
Knight, the Prioress, and the Par-
doner. It is a. poetic modernization,
written in verses that match those of
the original. It is reliable, and is a
great help on the stickers. And all
you have to do is walk up to the
library desk ' and say, “Give‘ me
Chaucer’s ‘Canterbury Tales.’ " If

your professor raises his eyebrows—,
or his voice—you need only act non-,l1'ii‘-Se ﬁe‘-<1. Mich - - -

chalant, and remark, “Yes, it is some
help, but it lacks the ringing spirit
and dashing verve of the original.
They can’t beat Chaucer!”

When you get up against the Par-
doner’s Tale, and your prof tells you
to swallow it whole, rationalize a lit-
tle bit and try the splendid transla-
tion by Katharine Leo Bates. You'll
find it in a high school English text-
book by Briggs, Curry and Payne.
To get it, write on a library request
slip, “370.8 . . . English Lit. . . .
Briggs, Curry, and Payne” and the
fascinating Pardoner’s Tale will be
before you, minus the clogging dust
of centuries and spelling of the an-
tiquities, Then you tell your instruc-
tor, “I didn’t like the original This
translation is much more interesting.
You can get the moral easier!”

In another high school book, Pace’s
“English Literature with Readings,”
there is an accurate translation, writ-
ten in story form, of the Prologue and
the Pardoner’s Tale. It is good for a
quick review of the material, but
since your instructor has probably
scanned it, you had better not follow
it too closely.

One more thing about Chaucer be-
beforc we leave him . instructors
may be interested to learn that the
library has a two—vo1ume edition of
the whole group of tales. It is a
modernized translation, by one ‘Vil-
liam Van 'Wyck, and is reputed to be
one of the few versions that retain
the entire sense, meaning, and sub-
tlety of the original. Since it is a
valuable folio set, it is kept locked
up . . . but Mr. Dice has the key.

Panther Task LCCETES Harder
As West Virginians Improve

 

I

Several things became evident in‘¢
the local games played over the past
weekend, First, that the VVest Vir-
ginia Mountaineers are deﬁnitely back
in the class of “big-league" football
teams_ A rather handy victory over
their usual stumbling blocks, Du-
quesne’s Dukes, proved that. Second,
there was the rather haphazard fash-
ion in which the Panthers took over
W&J, a fashion which prompted Jock
Sutherland to remark after the game
that Pitt would have to be playing 50
per cent better football, come next
Saturday, to down West Virginia.

Down at Morgantown, there seems
to have been a new birth of the
something or other which it takes to
make football teams click. Always
strong in man-power, the Mountain-
eers appear to have struck that happy
touch, under Coach “Trusty” Tallman.
which is producing sustained marches
and touchdowns.

Led by the hard-running “Eek”
Allen, a seasoned quarterback and as
game a ball player as has ever stepped
on Zllountaineer ﬁeld, West Virginia
presents a trio of backs whose
prowess is no secret to the Panthers.
Patsy Slate and John Thomas are
two halfbacks who are capable of
tearing off a long run or slicing off a
tackle at any time.

Most prominent among the VVest
Virginia linemen are the towering Joe
Stydahar, tackle de luxe; Goodwin, an
end; and Stewart, a veteran center.

An interesting feature of the game
will be the use of two systems of lin-
ing up, each an innovation to the
team using it. Pitt’s “Highland Fling"
appears to have been quite successful
in its baptism on the Stadium island
Saturday. West Virginia’s adaption
of the “squirrel-cage huddle,” con-
ceived by the Southern Californians,
is likewise doing favorably.

 

Varsity Cagers
Start Practice

 

Dr. Carlson Calls Preliminary

Drills For All Candidates

 

Preliminary practice for both
freshman and varsity basketball will
begin next Monday, October 8. Over
twenty members from last year’s var-
sity and freshman squads are expect-
ed to report,

The length of practice this year is
nearly identical to that of last year.
The opening practice will last two

weeks, until October 22, when Dr. H.
C. Carlson, varsity coach, will give
the squad a two—weeks’ vacation. It
will resume practice then for the ﬁrst
game of the season with Bucknell, De-
cember 6 at Pittsburgh.

Two basketball clinics have been
arranged to take place before the sea-
son’s opening. The ﬁrst will be at
Johnstown Junior College. The ten-
tative date is the Friday after Thanks-
giving, November 27. On Saturday,
December 8, Dr. Carlson will hold his
regular annual clinic at the Pitt Sta-
dium.

Both last year's varsity and fresh-
man teams had exceptionally ﬁne sea-
sons. Dr. Carlson again turned out a
winning varsity, taking 18 out of 21
games against the class of the coun-
tr_v’s basketball teams, The Panthers
shared the city championship with
Duquesne, each winning three games
and losing one, while in the Eastern
Inter-collegiate Conference, Pitt again
took the honors with eight victories
and no defeats. The freshman team,
under the coaching of Dr. Kowallis,
wound up with 14 wins out of 20
games after a faltering start.

This year’s varsity promises to be
another excellent team, with only
three regulars missing from last sea-
son, those being Charley Hughes, Don
McCamant, and Russ Ochsenhirt.
VVillie Hughes and Claire Cribbs, this
year's co-captains, Roderick, Noon,
and Wainio remain of last season’s
varsity with several good players
coming up from the freshman team
in Emerick, Ferguson, and Jesko.

The proposed southern trip sched-
uled during this coming Christmas
holidays has been called off, because
of regular games being scheduled
near the same date. However, the
same trip has been promised to the
varsity in 1935.

The 1934-35 basketball schedule in-
cludes six new opponents and twenty-
three games in'all. The new teams
are Bucknell, Iowa, Wisconsin, Navy,
Fordham, and Penn State.

Wrestling Team
Starts Practice

 

Bradford Ilsley, assistant varsity
wrestling coach, is now calling for all
candidates who are interested in
wrestling. All these men should re-
port to the stadium this afternoon.
There will be a. freshman team this
year and all freshman are invited to
report. Experience’ is not needed, all
that is required is your time and ef-
fort. ’

The Varsity had a very successful
team last year, winning two and los-
ing the same number. They downed
Carnegie Tech and Waynesburg, and
fell victims to the strong West Vir-
ginia and Wash-Jeff teams.

Members of the varsity squads who
will return this year are, 118-pound
class, Evans, Thiessen, and Babcock;
125-pound class, Hinchberger and
Hulmer; 135 pound class, Bedillion,
Van Ormer, and Penner; 145-pound,
class, Barr, Conley, and -Cover; 155-
pound class, George, Cox, and Semin-
off; 165-pound class, Willets, Hermes.
and Ebert; 175-pound class, Nicksick,
Kaduich, and Palacelli; and in the
heavyweight‘ class, Detzel, captain,
Valenti, and Buskirk. “

Freshman Frances Shapiro Smashes Female-Less Record
Of Aeronautical Engineering Class

By Marjorie Reich

Pitt has produced butchers and
bakers and candle-stick makers; in
June 1938 it will produce its ﬁrst
woman aeronautical engineer. But
freshman Frances Shapiro, of German-
town, Pennsylvania, is used to break-
ing records as she soars Over Phila-
delp«hia’s skyscrapers in an a11t0giF0-

Beginning ﬂying when she was a
sophomore in high school, this 18-year-
old aviatrix has managed to get in the
required number of hours for a Pilotts
license, but has decided to wait until
she graduates from the University 10
apply for it.

Lack of a license, nevertheless,
doesn't keep Frances on the ground.
This summer she spent her spare
hours practicing ci‘oss—couiitry ﬂying,
and though her longest ﬂight has
been from Philadelphia to Trenton,
New Jersey, she insists that the ﬂight
had all the thrills of a trans-contineii-
tal ﬂight

Selecting an autogiro instead of the
regular type plane because she be-
lieves them to be safer, as well as
more signiﬁcant in the future, Miss
Shapiro is a familiar ﬁgure iii 
Philadelphia airports, where she is
the youngest girl ever to DI‘eD31“€ f01'
a pilot’s license.

Varied Program
Oﬁered By WAA

Athletics, Cultural Lectures
Comprise Year’s Events

For women who enjoy a good swim
once in a while and who are inter-
ested in hearing talks gil/‘en by
prominent athletes, Ruth Anderson,
Ed36, chairman of the WAA Member-
ship campaign, recommends entrance
into that organization.

 

 

The drive is divided into class
teams. The sophomore team mem-
bers are: Lulu Sekey, Carol Bank-

son, Dorothy Holbrook, and -Charlotte
Atwell_ Junior team members include
Jane Booth, Carolyn Hall, D01‘0thY
Miller, and Ruth de Forest. Mary
Grace Wolff and Vera Kost are the
senior committee. Members of the
winning team will receive a week’s

activities credit toward a VVAA award, [

Any girl may buy El. semester's meni-

Miss Shapiro believes that her sex
is not a handicap to her ambitions:

“In the actual flying of an airplane,
a woman has an equal opportunity
with a man to be a successful pilot.
In direct aeronautical engineering, I
am not sure. It has been a pretty
woman-less occupation until the past
few years.”

Although Chemistry, physics and
math are not the most thrilling sub-
jects for a girl who wants to be ﬂying
above the clouds, Miss Shapiro ﬁnds
them interesting enough, but wishes
the two years intervening between
now and when she actually enters the
aeronautical department of engiiieer-
ing were over. She chose the Univer-
sity from among all other schools
which offer courses in aeronautical
engineering because it was recom-
mended so highly by the United
States Department of Commerce.

If. on one of these bright days. while
looking out of the Cathedral windows,
3 you chance to see an autogiro spelling
‘UNIVERSITY OF PITTS-
B U R G H with loops and turns, it will
probably be Miss Shapiro, who intends
to take her ﬁrst ﬂight over Pittsburgh,
solo, as soon as she ﬁnds her way to
an airport.

15 Organizations Draw Lines For
“Most Important” 9 Days
Of College Season

Fraternity rushing will officially
open at 8:30 o’clock Friday morning.
Approximately 550 freshmen and
transfer students will be feted during
rushing period. This year’s program,
as previously announced by N. Robert
Seidle, assistant to the dean of men
and fraternity adviser, will be fea-
tured by an extravagant repertoire of
social affairs.

Fraternities may, however, hold
dances Friday or Saturday nights as
school regulations prohibit scheduling
rushing dances for any week-day
night unless no classes are held the
following day. The number of other
rushing affairs is also limited but fra-
ternities may secure special permis-
sion for extra affairs by petitioning
Stlidellt-F0 culty association.

Silence period will begin 2 o’clock
Sunday moiiiing, October 14, and ex-
tend until 5 o’clock Thursday after-
noon, October 18_ During this period,
no rushee may speak to members of
any fraternity which has rushed him.
Riishees are given this time to decide
on a fraternity without aiiyinﬂuence
from interested fraternities.

Edward McBride, C34, president of
Council last fraternity rushing sea-
son, issued the following statement in
reference to fraternity rushing:

“There are two things which every
ruslie-e\1;articularly every freshman
rusliee———should realize before rushing
gets under way. First, do not coi1-
sidcr any fraternity which has vio-
lated its own code of honor by ap-
proaching you on any matter concern-
ing a fraternity before the season
designated by school regulations.
Such groups are not worth your while
and should be reported to the dean
of men.

“Second: fraternity men may give
you a big or a small rush; you may
get many invitations or you may get
few. Attend every affair to which
you are invited with an open mind.
Don’t go through rushing with a pre-
conceived idea of pledging a certain
organization because that fraternity
boasts of a football star or political
inﬂuence. If you think you can get
along best with fellows of a certain
group who want you with them, join

that fraternity-”

Harvard Students Publish
Conﬁdential Course Guide

 

Freshmen Receive “Low Down” On Classes And Faculty
In Pamphlets Distributed By Student Paper

Student analyses, not given in the
college catalogue, of several upper-
class courses at Harvard, were recent-
ly published by the Harvard Crimson,
student daily p-aper, in its annual Con-
ﬁdeiital Guide. It is distributed pre-
vious to the date for handing in study
cards.

This year the Crimson initiated a

system of mailing a copy of the Con-
ﬁdential Guide to all incoming fresh-
men, containing reviews of all courses
open to them. This pamphlet was;
mailed during the early weeks of Sep-
tember and was headed by a foreword
by Delmar Leighton, dean of fresh-
nicn. . _
Dean Leighton in his foreword eni-
phasized the fact that the information
contained in the Guide was as valua-E
ble as that in the catalogue since it
gave, what he termed the “dope” by
men who had taken the courses and
not by those who had given them.
Several professors who have com-
mented on the pamphlet have declar-
ed that they valued the Guide because
it acted as an incentive to section
men who were inclined to become
careless.

-‘The criticism of
courses gave a brief resume of the
scholarly attainmeiits of the professor
in question; his status in his ﬁeld of
study; a description of the subject
material in the course; and the pro-
fessor’s presentation of it, Despit.e
the scholarly dignity of a man who
does not present his lectures in a
stimulating and interesting manner,
the professor is criticised.

In the case of Professor Samuel
Eliot M.orison, who gives a course,
The Thirteen Colonies to 1760*. and
is an internationally known authority
in American Colonial history, the
Guide labels him quite pointedly in,
“ . he is handicapped by knowing
too much about his subject, and by
his inability to limit his expression to
a proportional picture of the outstand-
ing events and processes of the pe-
riod .” The criticism of Pro-

ing to The Guide is a coming ﬁgure
in the ﬁeld of history, warns the
