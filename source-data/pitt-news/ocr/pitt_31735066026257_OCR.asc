‘ Low attendance at SGB meeting

By Nathan Hughes
For The Pitt News

Last night the Student

Government Board met and ,

went over reports given by
each member.

The audience consisted of
two news reporters, three com-
mittee heads and 20-some
empty chairs.

“lt’s very disappointing, con-
sidering an ad was placed in
The Pitt News. ,We updated the
bulletin board, and the meeting
time is now included,” said
SGB President Julie Crowell.

“It’s a shame. We do a whole

lot of work for students, and
it’s really discouraging, so we
will work on this.” '

“We were really disappointed
because there were almost no
students at our meeting,” said
SGB President pro tempore,
Julie Clouse.

It was suggested in The Pitt
News editorial last week that
the meetings be moved from
the SGB Office in 639 William
Pitt ‘Union’ to a “higher—profile
location.” SGB is planning on
holding meetings once a month
on the ground floor of the
union. '

“We are currently looking

University of Pittsburgh

into renting a space for our
meetings in the William Pitt
Union,” Clouse said.

“We’re going to take as
many major steps as we can to
get more people to these meet-
ings. We are here for them,”
said Crowell.

Despite the low turnout, the
meeting proceeded with dis-
cussion on the Dance Marathon
to be held April 7-8. It will
take place at Fitzgerald Field
House from ,7 p.m. Friday
night to 7 p.m. Saturday. The
proceeds will go to the Family
House charity, and all Pitt stu-

Health Fair

By Julie D. Hannon
For The Pitt News

Free give—aways and
entertainment will
accompany the health
information at the Pitt
Student Health _
Service’s llth Annual
Health Fair tomorrow
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room.

“Health Fair ‘95: For
the Health of It” is free
and open to the public.
Health information and
screenings will be
available, including
body fat percent, blood
pressure and choles-
terol, and oral exams by
the Pitt dental school
will be available also.

There will be 38
hea1th—related organiza-
tions on hand to inform
and educate on impor-
tant health issues from
exercising to preventing
sexually transmitted
diseases, according to
Shirley Haberman of
the Health ‘Education
Office. ,

“Although the fair is
opened to the public,
it’s geared towards col-
lege students. It’s our
opportunity to introduce
students to a healthy
lifestyle in a positive,
high-energy atmos-
phere,” said Haberman.

And while catching
up on the latest health

It’s financial aid applica-
tion time, and that means
that once again many stu-
dents will find themselves
confused and perplexed by a
myriad of financial forms
and regulations.

The 10th Annual toll-free
Financial Aid Hotline will be

\ fielding calls this week from

Pennsylvania students with
financial aid questions. The
toll-free hotline number for
Western Pennsylvania is 1-
800-762-1001.

Over 300,000

Pennsylvania students cur-
rently receive either federal
or state financial assistance,
said PHEAA press officer
John Ebersole.

“The hotline is a wonder-
ful resource for anyone with
financial aid questions,” said
Pennsylvania State Rep. Don
Walko of Allegheny,
“including students attending
technical or business school,
nursing school or a four-year
college.”

The hotline will be staffed
from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. each
night during the following
week by volunteers from
local colleges and preparato-

ry schools, said Wendy
Dunlap, hotline coordinator.
Although the week-long
hotline received 1,000 calls
last year at its Pittsburgh site
alone, Dunlap noted that
“it’s usually pretty easy to
get through.” If the hotline is
very busy, operators
will take the caller’s
name and phone number
and return the call, said

Dunlap.
Callers to the hotline range
from undergraduate

and graduate students down
to high school students
thinking about college.
According to Dunlap, the

Call state hotline for financial aid questions

questions vary as much as
the clientele, but the most
common question around
this type of year is: “How do

. I fill out this financial aid

form?”

Because the hotline is
an informational service
staffed by volunteers, it can-
not be used to request finan-
cial aid forms or inquire
about the status of an appli-
cation.

Pitt’s Office of Financial
Aid can be reached for ques-
tions during regular business
hours throughout the year by
dialing 624-PITT, and then
the number.four.

JERUSALEM While
Israelis buried the 19 killed
from Sunday’s suicide bomb-
ing, their government resisted
pressure to delay peace talks
with the PLO.

Under pressure from Israel,
the PLO said that they would
take action against militant
groups in the Palestinian-
ruled Gaza Strip.

Israeli police said it was
difficult to determine who
was involved in the bombing.

KOBE, Japan — A strong
aftershock struck Kobe
Monday as residents were try-
ing to return to normal in the
wake of last week’s earth-
quake.

The aftershock registered
4.3 on the Richter scale, ham-
pering efforts to search for
125 people still missing after
the original earthquake, regis-
tering 7.2 on the Richter.

More than 1.000 tremors
have hit central Japan in the

WASHINGTON
According to Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, the
proposed package of up to

$40 billion in U.S. loans to
Mexico would contain strong
guidelines.

The conditions will help
prevent more of the financial
mistakes that led to the peso
crisis, but the package must
first get through Congress,
Rubin said.

Cjnum the Nation

NEW YORK Most
Americans believe the nation
is in fair or pretty good shape,
according to a public opinion
poll published Monday.

The poll, conducted by
Harris was done a telephone
survey of 1,250 in the United
States. Twenty-six percent
said that crime is the main
issue, followed by health
care.

Only two percent answered
that the country is in excellent
shape. 30 percent said it is
pretty good, 49 percent said it
is fair and 19 percent think it
is poor.

President Clinton is expect-

ed to discuss the issue in his
State of the Union speech
tonight. — Reuters

NEW YORK — According
to a CBS poll, only one in
five Americans wants abor-
tion outlawed.

The poll, released Sunday
on the 22nd anniversary of
Roe vs. Wade, found U.S. atti-
tudes have changed little
since the Supreme Court deci-
sion that made abortion legal.

The survey found that sup-
port for making abortions
available was strongest
among college graduates,
with 47 percent favoring gen-
eral availability for abortions.

dents are invited to take part.

“There are 12 subcommittees
and three overall chairs. We’re
really pulling together to get
everyone more involved. It’s
not just a Greek event,” said
Crowell.

Also at the meeting, SGB
ruled out the plan to have the
musical group Pearl Jam come
to Pitt.

we’re not bringing them is it’s
just way too much money and
there’s too much risk
involved,” said board member
John Callahan.

Callahan had formulated the
idea of attempting to bring
Pearl Jam to Pitt and discussed
it with other Board members
and the Pitt Program Council.

“I definitely think that some-
thing like this would have
boosted the spirit of the stu-

  

dents, and I hoped that it
would decrease the apathy and
give them something to point
out,” Callahan said.

The Board also discussed
plans on performing a commu-
nity service project in associa-
tion with the School of the
Blind. This will take place dur-
ing the last two weeks of
February and consists of board
members working with blind 0
students.

Ban budget balance

With this year’s Congress aiming to prove that it is no
longer gridlocked, the next item on the legislative agenda is
a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.

According to The New York Times, the House plans to vote
on the measure by the end of this month, though the Senate
is not likely to vote on it until next month, and approval in
either chamber is uncertain.

The amendment would require the federal budget to be
balanced each year and that there be no spending beyond
revenues. This would eliminate all deficit spending, but not
the deficit itself. _ j ,

While this all looks good on paper, the balanced budget
amendment would best be left out to pasture. The first thing
to remember is that nearly everyone, from large corporations
and governments to private citizens, has a deficit.

It doesn’t have such a fancy name — usually it is just
called money that is owed to the bank. Credit cards, mort-
gage and student loans are all forms of a personal budget
deficit. » '

In addition, no one is exactly sure how the balanced bud-
get amendment would be paid for. Most likely, the states
would suffer and so would necessary federal programs.

Those programs which would survive would most likely
be those which were political spoils for one interest group or
another.

The sacred cows of election time will continue to grow fat
on political fodder while less well known, but necessary
programs will fall by the wayside.

The state-funded programs will also end up hurt in all of I

this. All states receive some percentage of their budget from
the federal government. This ranges from 15 percent for
Hawaii to 58 percent for Alabama.

While all states except Vermont have legal requirements to
have a balanced budget, as The New York Times correctly
points out, these same states use all manners of tricks to
make it appear as though their budgets are balanced and yet
stil1_runadeficit. _ , . , j *

If they don’t resort to philandering, they issue bonds or
slash programs indiscriminately andtry to deal with the con-
sequences by using stop-gap methods.

Republican leaders are insisting that Social Security, the
military and prison maintenance costs must be left
untouched and taxes must not be raised. '

Therefore, all other programs must face cuts up to 30 per-
cent. Yet paying for expensive military toys and cutting
money for education, worker retraining and transportation
funds are not the ways to move this country into the 20th
century. A .

Instead, what is needed is a incremental reduction of the
deficit. Slash and burn methods will only lead to the erosion
of this country’s infrastructure.

Liberal Hypocrisy

"Here are two examples of
Liberal Hypocrisy.

During the campaigns of
1994, Democratic candidates
used the words trickle-down
economics in a disgusted
tone. For those of you who
don’t know what those words
mean, briefly the theory is
that when the wealthy are
free to use their money to
invest, i.e. lower taxes, they
will invest in ways that cre-
ate jobs. _

You have to look no fur-
ther than the Pittsburgh
Pirates to see this is true.
The Pirates are and will con-
tinue to be owned by people
whom with their investment
jobs will trickle down and be
created.

If the theory is wrong, then
why is the very liberal
Mayor Murphy fighting
to keep the team in town?
Jobs.

The recent flap over the
book “The-Bell Curve” and
the NCAA raising its acade-
mic standards are both con-
nected. See, many argue that
the results of the data and
conclusions drawn in the
book are wrong.

If so, then why when the
NCAA raises standards do
coaches such as John

Thompson of Georgetown

and Nolan Richardson of
Arkansas say the black stu-
dent-athlete will be most
affected. These same people
would argue__that blacks
don’t have lower IQ’s than
whites on average, and this
is probably tr-ue. Well then
why is the black athlete more
affected than the white one.
After all, both races take the
same standardized tests that
the data in “The Bell Curve”
is drawn from. You can’t
have it both ways, even
though you try.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Campus still safe

Since the very serious
assault on David Osborn on
Jan. 13, there has been exten-
sive media coverage of this
incident, in particular, and
crime in general on college
and university campuses in
Pittsburgh. The University of
Pittsburgh campus has been
the focus of the vast majority
of this coverage, which includ-

‘ed interviews with Pitt stu-

dents and campus administra-
tors. In some i-nstances, this
reporting was distorted and
alarmist.

The specter of crime and
violencein America is brought
home to us every day, whether
it occurs randomly on the
streets of America’s cities, in
homes or on the campus. It has
heightened the awareness of
all of us to be vigilant, to be
more cautiousjand, in many
instances, has caused us to
alter our daily lives.

On the other hand, to
respond excessively to the
threat of crime in such a man-
ner as to relegate ourselves 
as virtual prisoners would rob
us of the freedom which we so
deeply cherish in this land, and
lessen the opportunities for all
of us to enjoy the cultural rich-
ness of this area. While safety
is always a concern, official
crime reports indicate that,
compared to other...universi-
ties in Pennsylvania and
throughout the nation, our
campus is a relatively safe
place  Moreover, we should
be heartened by the profes-
sionalism consistently
shown by our campus security
in pursuing arrests of
offenders.

I would simply urge you to
enjoy Pitt and its campus,
while maintaining the aware-
ness all of us must exercise
regardless of where we are.

Leon L. Haley
Vice Chancellor for Student
and Public Affairs

RAs are human too

Resident Assistants are
students just like anybody
else on this campus. Their
job still proves to be promis-
ing and at times even
rewarding. Yet, it is a job
where they can see as an idi-
vidual they do make a differ-
ence, and it is something
they can each take pride in.
They are people capable of
fault and just as capable of
being a responsible adult and
making amends for their
mistakes when deemed nec-
essary.

However long we fight to
be understood, we realize it’s
too long and too complex for
most people to grasp the
entire truth. RAs made a
mistake, it was not made
maliciously, and granted not
very intelligent.

However, the point is, 13
very dedicated, caring and
many who had exceeded the
previous recommended qual-
ifications have had their
positions as .a Resident
Assistant terminated. No one
really cares either how indi-
viduals choose to rationalize
the dismissal of 13 very
competent and prominent
Resident Assistants.

We ask for some respect,

and we ask for a thank you.
A thank you for the numer-
ous hours we have spent in
the emergency room  for
being an RA on our “person-
al time” without questioning
where the line was drawn
and for everything else we
have done.
. We, I speakl believe for
many, did not deserve to be
fired. The Office of
Residence Life has lost some
of the most valuable assets
they had, and if they think
we as individuals can
be replaced that easily,
they’ve got to be kidding
themselves.

its Big East hex in a convinc-

St. John’s Red—whatevers 94-

Now, the Panthers are about
to scorch each and every Big
East competitor one by one,
starting this Wednesday when
Seton Hall visits the Fitzgerald
Terrordome.

With all the criticisms of this

, scrappy Panther squad — like

they’re too slow, too under-
manned, too small — one
minor detail alludes people
when they think of Pitt: it
could conceivably be unde-
feated -in conference play. - A

Don’t let Pitt’s 1-6 confer-
ence record fool you.

The Panthers had several
opportunities to win every Big
East game, but they just came
up lame in every instance.

Pitt had the national power-
house UConn Huskies’ necks
in a noose, but didn’t kick the
chair away. Subsequently,
UConn escaped a 25-point
deficit and turned it into an 11‘-
point win.

The Panthers lost to No. 8
Syracuse by two, a game that
they should have won if they
played any semblance of bas-
ketball in the first half.

And as badly as Pitt played
against Georgetown, the
Hoyas were just as bad. It was
as ugly as a game could get ——
Pitt turned the ball over 35
times —— but the Panthers still
had a chance to win. I guess
scoring six points in the last

' 8:50 of the game isn’t enough

to win.

Against Providence, the
Panthers were in the game the
whole time, they just came up
a little short, losing by four,
85-81. Also, they lost to
Villanova by two.

So, as you can see, Pitt defi-
nitely has the capacity to be p
more than an occasional spoil-
er — it can win games, with
regularity.

The only thing that’s holding
the Panthers back are them-
selves. They seem to squander
every lead or shove them-

The University of Pittsburgh wrestling team
placed eighth out of 16 top wrestling pro-
grams held at the University of Nebraska at
Lincoln this past weekend.

The 24th-ranked Panthers ﬁnished the meet
with 2-3 record, defeating No. 23 Oregon
State and No. 16 Arizona State. One of the
Panthers’ losses came at the hands of No. 14
Penn State and two losses were to No. 10-
ranked North Carolina.

North Carolina manhandled Pitt in the
opening round of the competition, winning
easily 30-7. Chad Jesko, at the 126 weight
division and J.J. Fasnacht at 142 were the
lone Panther victories in the opening round
loss.

“J.J. [Fasnacht] was 5-0 in the matches and
wrestled the best,” assistant coach Bob Truby
said. “Every guy at one time wrestled a really
good match.”

Pitt rebounded well in the quarterfinals
against Oregon State, winning by the score of
22- 17. Once again Chad J esko led the Panther
attack, scoring a major decision over Rich
Wheeler of OSU 16-1. The heavier weights
of the Panthers carried the rest of the load, as
Brett Gould, John Withrow, Jeff Byer and Pat
Wiltanger all won narrow decisions to gain
the points needed for victory. John Gibeaut
had theeasiest time of anyone, as his OSU
opponent forfeited to give the Panthers :1 big
six points. ~

“We came back after a tough match an
wrestled a higher ranked team,” Truby said. “I
think the guys are pretty happy with the
matches.”

Pitt entered the consolation rounds of the
competition by defeating the Sun Devils of.
Arizona State 18-13. Down 13-9, the Panthers
mounted a comeback led by John Gibeaut at
177 pounds, Mark Bodo at 190 and heavy-
weight Wiltanger to lead the Panthers to their
second victory of the competition.

By ﬁnishing in the top eight of the meet,
Pitt automatically received an invitation to

Pitt men 's gymnastics

lands in third at Navy

By Brad Isles
For The Pitt News

The. Pitt men’s gymnastics
team travelled to Annapolis, Md.,
last Saturday to compete in the
U.S. Naval Academy
Invitational. The trip proved to be
successful, as the Panthers placed
third in the seven-team ﬁeld.

The Panthers tallied an overall
score of 213.45. This trailed only
meet-winner Penn State (224.75)
and host Navy (216.70). Other
teams competing were: James
Madison (212.15), William and
Mary (208.85), Radford (199.80)
and the University of Washington
(186.90).

Penn State should get used to
the view from the top of the
pack. “Penn State is one of the
top three in the nation,” said
junior Jason Lannie.

M ,. Lannie led the way for the

‘Panthers, plac-ingfourth in all-
around competition with a score
of 53.5. This included a career-
high 895 on high bar. He also
had Pitt’s best score on pommel
horse (8.95) and high bar, and
was second best on rings with a
9.25.

“We all stuck together through

the whole meet. The camaraderie
was great. There were no down
points at all,” said Lannie.

Junior Keith Yo’undt was top
scorer on rings with a 9.3. He
also led the Panthers on vault
(9.0) and parallel bars (9.35).

‘Sophomore Scott Carslaw topped

the list on the ﬂoor exercise with
a 9.55. .

Behind Lannie in the all-
around was another junior, Brian
Narvaez, who had an overall
score of 51.5. This included an
8.85 on vault and an 8.8 on rings.

“We need four solid scores to

maintain our overall score,”
Narvaez said. “My main goal for
the weekend was to hit all of my
events.” ‘
Narvaez is working through a
back problem and looks to
increase his score over the next
few meets by incorporating more
difﬁculty into his routines.

'“I’m trying to get back to -t

where I was last year,” said
Narvaez.

The key point of the match for
Pitt may have been the pommel
horse. VV1th the ﬁrst two competi-
tors, Mike Maurer and George

A battered and bruised
women’s gymnastics team took
second out of a four-team ﬁeld at
Rutgers on Saturday.

“The kids did well in holding
their own,” head coach Debbie
Yohman said. .

Already missing junior
Bethany Toellner due .to injury,
the Lady Panther squad was
dealt another blow when junior
Michaelene Myers was forced to
miss the meet with a possible
broken ﬁbula in her leg.

Rutgers won the competition

with a team score of 182.30. Pitt

(181,825) took second, followed
closely by James Madison
University (181.80) with West
Chester University (165.9) plac-
ing a distant fourth.

“We deﬁnitely improved from
last week,” Yohman said.

In the all-around competition,
Pitt co-captain Brenda Stevens
took first place with a score of
37.225. Sophomore Robyn
Senior (36.35) ﬁnished fourth in
the all-around.

“We look to Brenda to lead us
into every meet, and she has

done just that,” Yohman said.

In the balance beam competi-
tion, junior Deena Daller led the
way for Pitt by scoring 9.275,
her high score on this apparatus
for the season. Sophomore Lori
Buck (9.25) backed up Da1ler’s
score for the Lady Panthers.
Freshman Joy McElhinny scored

1 9.0 in her ﬁrst time on the beam

for Pitt.

“It was nice to start on beam,”
Yohman said. “We looked great,
the kids looked sharp.”

On the uneven bars, Stevens
led the way for Pitt with a score
of 9.4. She had the highest score
of any competitor on this event
at the meet. Freshman Kristin
Bond’s score of 9.25 on this
event was the highest of_her
young collegiate career.

In the vaulting ' competition,
Pitt was led once again by
Stevens (9.325). Trailing her in
the lineup were freshman Tracey
Brown (9.15), who saw her ﬁrst
action as a Lady Panther, and
junior Christine Battista (9.075).

On the ﬂoor exercise mat, Pitt
had its best team event of the
afternoon. Stevens led the way
with a 9.5. Freshman Calli

Bodnar scored her career high
9.35, and Senior (9.325) took
third for the Lady Panthers.

“Calli needs to sit out a couple
of weeks with a stress fracture in
her leg,’’ Yohman said. “But we
needed her, and she improved
every bit of her routine from last
week.”

At Rutgers, Pitt scored team
highs in three events. Those
highs came in uneven bars
(44.40), balance beam (45675),
and ﬂoor exercise (46.45).

The injury story for the Lady
Panthers as they head into this
weekend’s meet with the
University of New Hampshire is
still up in the air. According to
Yohman, Toellner is due back
soon, Myers is going to be out

another week or two and Bodnar
needs to rest for about two
weeks.

“Mikie Myers is definitely a
kid with heart,” Yohman said. “I
hope we can get lucky and keep
her injury—free.”

Needing to dig deeper into her
line up, Yohman is looking for
some production from her older
gymnasts like Daller.

“We would all like to see
Deena Daller come back,”
Yohman said. “She has the talent
