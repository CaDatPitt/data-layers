With an echo of quacks reminis-
cent of the ’90s ﬁlm “The Mighty
Ducks,” the Student Government
Board members conﬁrmed their
presence during roll call at Tues-
day’s public meeting.

The members assumed the ca-
maraderie and jovial tone as they
entered the ﬁnal two weeks of their
tenure on the Board.

Board President James Lan-
dreneau opened the meeting by
congratulating the newly elected
2013 Board and announced the
Jan. 10 inauguration date before
about ﬁve people gathered in
Nordy’s Place of the William Pitt
Union. Following suit, the Board
members proceeded to offer their
congratulations to the incoming
Board before providing project up-

dates after their week-long hiatus _

due to the holiday break.

“I am ﬁrmly against three
weeks of inactivity andlnot hearing
what the Board has been working
on,” Landreneau said. “Although

' you may hear a lot of quacks for

reports.”

Board member Gordon Loud-
erback said he had received “excit—
ing” news that the University will
install wireless Internet in resi-
dences halls that don’t currently
have the services for the fall 2013
semester and look to expand wire-

Pitt weathered a hot start from
the ﬁeld by the Howard men’s bas-
ketball team Tuesday night, and
pulled away in the second half to
register a 24-point victory, 70-46.

Hot three—point shooting kept
the Panthers in the game in the
ﬁrst half, and suffocating defensive
pressure helped them pull away in
the second at the Petersen Events
Center.

Lamar Patterson knocked down
a career-high ﬁve three-pointers
on eight attempts — making four
of those in the ﬁrst half — and ﬁn-
ished the contest with-15 points
after averaging equally as many
in last week’s N.I.T. Season Tip- Off
games at Madison Square Garden.
Patterson’s teammates — espe-
cially freshman point guardjames
Robinson —— found him open pri-
marily in the corner, where Patter-
son made all four of his three—point
tries in theﬁrst half. ,

The key to his three-point suc-
cess tonight and the last few con-
tests? “Just shooting it,” he said.

“A _lot of credit goes to [Rob-
inson] and Tray [Woodal1]. I just
gotta be ready ,to shoot it,” Pat-
terson said. -

Scoring that same amount for
the Panthers (6-1) was Woodall, the

redshirt senior point guard. While _‘

Yale chemist discusses innovation in green science

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Paul Anastas stood before an audience
and showed pictures of women protest-
ing for the right to vote, advertisements
of doctors recommending cigarettes and
engravings of people using leeches to cure
diseases. '

“It taxes our imagination to under-
stand how they could have ever been ad-
opted as fact,” Anastas said of women at
one time being considered incompetent
to vote, suggested health beneﬁts associ-
ated with smoking and the use of leeches
as a medical remedy.

Anastas believes that future genera-
tions will feel the same way about our
present damaging environmental prac-
tices.

“I thoroughly believe we can and we
must undergo a transformation that will
take us off the unsustainable trajectory
we are on,” Anastas said.

Anastas served as the speaker at Tues-

day evening’s 2012 Heinz Distinguished
Lecture in the William Pitt Union Ball-
room. The event attracted about 200 peo-
ple. The annual Heinz Lecture, sponsored
by the University of Pittsburgh Mascaro
Center for Sustainable Innovation and the
Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering, brings a speaker to campus
each year to discuss issues related to en-
vironmental engineering.

Between 2009 and 2012, Anastas was
assistant administrator and science ad-
viser for the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. He also held leadership posi-
tions in the EPA during the Clinton and
Bush administrations. He currently holds
a professorship at Yale University and
serves as director of the Yale Center for
Green Chemistry and Green Engineering.

Anastas concentrated a large portion
of his lecture, titled “Designing Tomor-
row,” on what he considers an underex-
plored area of sustainability: reducing
toxicity in our environment. '

“Very small attention is paid to reduc-

ing toxicity,” he said-. “Chemical products
should be designed to preserve efficacy
of function, while reducing toxicity and
other environmental hazards. Choosing
the next-least bad thing off the shelf is

not the same as designing the properties.

and chemicals that you want.”

Anastas said reducing toxins from

the world must involve a collaboration
of chemists, engineers, toxicologists, bio-
chemists, ecologists and environmental
scientists. E

He added that more efforts need to r

be made to predict potential toxicity in
a chemical before it is created. New re-
search in chemical toxicity shows that

properties of chemicals can serve as pre-

dictors of toxicity. As an example, Anastas
put up a diagram showing that when a set
of tested chemicals had less solubility and

a greater value for a factor of reactivity, .

they proved less toxic.
Anastas said that just as chemists can
design chemicals to be either blue or red,
‘brittle or elastic, soon they will be able to

‘E9

design chemicals to be more or less toxic.

Despite the negative environmental
trends on display in the world today, An-
astas emphasized thathe remains opti-
mistic for the future.

Anastas presented an entire screen of
sustainable breakthroughs brought about
through green chemistry, including alter-
native energy and degradable polymers.

“Green chemistry has not grown to
where it is because you generate a little
less waste. It happened because of inno-
vation — new science, new technology.”

Anastas encouraged the audience
members to focus their energies on in-
novative projects instead of retreading
old ground.

He shared the story of a friend who
was receiving accolades for his work with
polaroid cameras when digital cameras
were coming out.

on the right thing. It doesn’t mean you’re
changing the world.” - A

During a question-and—answer ses-
sion that followed the lecture, a man
asked Anastas about his thoughts on the
government’s environmental regulatory
measures.

“Regulatory measures are critical,
essential, but not enough,” Anastas re-
sponded.

Anastas said that in his experience,
governmental regulatory measures for the
environment lead companies to ask how
environmentally abusive they can be and

still be on the right side of the law, rather
than working.to improve the environment.

“Creating a floor is not the same thing
as creating a race to the top.”

Eric Beckman, a professor in the De-
partment of Chemical and Petroleum
Engineering who asked Anastas to speak
at this year’s event, said the goal of the
speech was to fire up undergraduates
about the possibilities of green science.

The lecture achieved its objective with
at least one student. ,

‘.‘It reminded me to be optimistic,”
senior Grace Meloy said. “I have a big

issue with that, as an engineer. It’s good

to remember there is hope. We have the

“Considering the timeline, it is much

Stavrakos said, attributing the delay to “in—

said that her projects are smoothly moving
toward completion. Rothenberger said that
she met with the Student Technology Focus

Eric Baldwin
Columnist

The past two weeks have been a test
for democracy in the Middle East.
The only democratic liberal state
in the region was under constant
attack from the Gaza Strip, the Pal-
estinian territories. The terrorist
organization Hamas was set on
killing as many Israelis as possible,
and a senior leader claimed, “We
love death more than you [Israelis]
love life.”-In order to combat global
‘terror and cease the constant un-
rest in the Middle East, unwavering
support for Israel is the best option.

In the Israel Defense Forces’
mid-November operation “Pillar of

_ Defense,” which was launched in

reaction to a series of indiscriminate

- rocket attacks originating in the .

Gaza Strip, Israel showed, extraordi-
nary restraint in the face of terrorist
intent to disrupt life in Israel. The
west, particularly the U.S., supports
and stands behind Israel, because
democratic nations have an obliga-
tion to support fellow democracies
that are being threatened by terror
organizations. In order to assess the
situation correctly, it is paramount
to look at the tactics of both the Pal-
_estinians and the Israelis.

colonel of the British Armed Forces

In operation “Pillar of Defense,” the
IDF was able to strike and demolish
strategic points in the Gaza Strip, in
an effort to protect Israelis.

In order to reduce casualties in
the Gaza Strip, the IDF has dropped

crafts telling civilians not to be

warning civilians of IDF air strikes. These
measures were taken in addition to the abor-
tion of air strikes when aircraft pilots saw too
many civilians in a surrounding area and the
surgical precision of the air strikes, which has
minimized damage to non-targeted people
and areas.

Hamas, on the other hand, has not pub-
lished or announced any measures to reduce
casualties when they attack Israel. Israelis

have described Hamas’ crudely made missiles

as “sewage pipes with wings on them,” and
they are shot into Israel with no precision, no
warning and with the intent of killing as many

' Israelis as possible. It is the announced goal

and objective of Hamas to kill innocent Israelis
in the greatest possible numbers.

However, this is not Hamas’ only weapon."

The crude weapons they use are supplemented
by Iranian Fajr-5 surface-to_-air missiles, which
can take out buildings and kill in greater quan-
tities. Israeli air strikes ‘are aimed at terrorist
activities throughout the Gaza Strip and are
highly successful. During operation “Pillar
of Defense,” the IDF was able to execute air
strikes that killed 30 senior terror operatives
and 19 senior Hamas commanders.

The air strikes also destroyed 980 un-

derground rocket launchers, 14_0 drug-and-.

weapon—smuggling tunnels and 26 weapon-
manufacturing sites used by Hamas.
Israel is not without critique, however.

' Even with the precise military equipment of

the Israel Defense Forces and its expressed
desire to avoid civilian casualty, the numbers
are not in Israel’s favor. During the recent
“Pillar of Defense” operation, Israel carried
out 1,500 strikes in the Gaza Strip on alleged
terrorist targets. These air strikes causedthe
death of 166 Palestinians, at least 70 of them
civilians, while only six Israelis have been
killed during the recent escalation. Israel, be-
ing a nation intent on bringing prosperity and
permanent peace, exhibited extraordinary’
restraint. During major escalations, the Israel

activities is to use overwhelming force over a
long period of time.

Israel’s surface area measures less than
that of Newjersey, with an estimated popula-
tion of seven million, and the nation is facing
enemies on every front. Israel has the right
and the absolute need to defend itself while
being trapped between violent, unstable, un-
democratic regimes. While dealing with the
constant missile attacks coming from the Gaza
Strip in the South, Syrian rebels in the north
ﬁre into the ’Golan Heights on a daily basis.

substantial social unrest in Jordan and may
have to send troops to assist the only friendly
regime in the region. Just a short distance
away, Iran, whose president has claimed to
want to “wipe Israel off the face of the earth,”
ships weapons to Israel’s enemies, particularly
the Palestinians. Existence for Israel is not
easy, and a state that has attempted peace via
the diplomatic route is only left with 
options in the hope of one day having peace.

In the past year, the Palestinians have 5.
‘ launched 1,687 rockets into Israel.,Qf those

at

missiles, 997 were launched as of Nov. 14.
While Israeli strikes are never preemptive
or aimed at civilians, the Palestinian missile
strikes are always both. This aggressive behav-

4 ior also meets the threshold for international
war crimes. Intentional attacks on civilians are .

a clear violation of international law.

. Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of Hamas’
founder, recently renounced any ties with his
family or Hamas and is an outspoken critic
of the terrorist organization. He claims that
taking down the terror organization “is a ne-

cessity, not just for Israel, but for humanity.” n’

“Hamas was born to destroy. Hamas does
not know how to build,” he said.
It is often argued that Israel does little to

support peace. However, a look at empirical .

evidence shows that Israel always resorts to

' diplomatic routes before conducting military

operations. Israel engaged with the Palestin-
ians to ﬁnd mutually agreeable solutions in
the Camp David and Oslo negotiations. Israel
has appeased the,Palestinians by retracting
settlements in the West Bank and at times

retracting"  presence from the.Gaza _

Strip. However; it has proven futile. The last
time Israel gave Palestinians total control of
their own borders and retracted IDF person-
nel, the consequences took the-form of the
Second Intifada. \ . ’

Anyone who supports democracy and civil
society can only conclude that Israel is justiﬁed
in its action and that the Palestinians territo-

H ries are nothing more than a state led by an

enterprise of terror. The best way to counter
terror in the Middle.East is to support Israel.

TASSER’S TAKE

Universityof Mary|and’s move to Big ‘Ten deplorable

1

Donnie Tasser
Stajj” Wrz'ter

Shame on the University of Maryland.
Maryland announced last week that it
will leave the Atlantic Coast Conference, of
. which it is a founding member, to join the
Big Ten beginning in 2014. To go through
with this move, UMD will be forced to pay
the conference a $50 million exit fee.
That’s right, $50 million. And to think,
this summer the university announced that
due to a “budget crisis,” the athletic depart-

. ” ment planned to cut eight varsity sports:

I

men’s and women’s swimming, men’s ten-
nis, men’s indoor and outdoor track, men’s
cross-country, women’s water polo, aerobics
and tumbling. Unless the eight sports could
raise enough money —- eight years’ worth
 of revenue totaling $29 million, according
to a Washington Post article — they would
be eliminated, leaving their 131 athletes
without teams.
Only the men’s outdoor track team sur-

SPORTS

vived after raising $888,000. However, ac-
cording to the same_Washington Post article,
it still needs to raise $1.88 million by Dec.
31 to remain competitive for the 2013-2014
season. The track team, it should be noted,
is coached by Andrew Valmon, a two-time
Olympic "gold medalist who was head coach
for the United States track team at the 2012
London Olympics. Not even having such a
high-proﬁle ﬁgure attached to the program
kept it from the chopping block.

After undertaking a massive expansion

‘ to their football facility, Byrd Stadium, to

the tuneof $50.8 million in 2006 (resulting
in a $35 million debt), the higher-ups in the
athletic department made the decision in
2010 to buy out the remainder of then-head
football coach Ralph Friedgen’s contract for
$2 million. Exactly half of what the athletic
department .will lose this year could have
been covered, had they not ﬁred their foot-
ball coach: all of it for years to come could
have been covered, had they not expanded
their football stadium.

Oh, and did I mention that since the
expansion, Terrapin football attendance
has fallen every year? And their average
basketball attendance went down by more
than 1,700 people last season, the worst
drop in the ACC last year.

As a student—athlete in a non-revenue
sport, I am appalled that the NCAA would
allow a school whose revenue sports —— i.e.
football and basketball -— are responsible
for the debt to cut athletic programs and
then splurge to leave the conference with
which they’re affiliated. _

True, the money Maryland will make in

the Big Ten dwarfs what it will make in the

ACC — estimates are $43 million, compared
to $24 million, according to Sports Illus-
trated. But where is the money from the exit
fee coming from? This is not a popular move
among donors and alumni; Maryland is in
the heart of ACC country, has been a member
since 1952 and has well-established rivalries
in the conference. If the athletic department
is in such a dire situation, projecting $17 mil-

The only team to bring a national champion- '

ship to Pitt last year is looking to provide an
ultimate repeat this season.

Pitt men’s Ultimate ffisbee team ﬁnished
most of its preseason to-do list over the past
couple weeks. Now the club is ready to get its
disc spinning. -

“Winning once sure is fun and exciting,” 1

Coach Nick Kaczmarek said, “But our true
test —— the one that will deﬁne our program
— is in maintaining greatness.“

The team, which calls itself En Sabah Nur
after the Marvel Comics character Apocalypse,
was formed in the spring of 1998 when a group
of friendsfrom Sutherland Hall played some
pick-up games behind the old Pitt Stadium.
Last year, .Pitt’s A—team went 48-5 in tourna-
ment play and trumped Wisconsin for its ﬁrst
national championship. Pitt’s B—team was able
to earn its ﬁrst win at the regional tournament.

Pitt Ultimate recently spent the weekend of
Oct. 20 competing in a tournament at Rutgers
University. Because the fall serves as a pre-
season in college-level Ultimate, Pitt’s A— and
B-teams were yet to be chosen at the start of
the tournament. So En Sabah Nur broke down
into a split squad of two teams: Pitt X and Pitt
Y. Both went 5-2 in their respective weekend
matches.

Pitt X lost to Stevens Institute of Technol-

Ultimate D 9

lion in losses by 2017, where are they going
to come up with $50 million?

The NCAA, by allowing conference re-
alignment to happen, only reinforces the
view that it only cares about money. Screw
the little guy. Nobody watches swimming,
tennis or cross-country on TV, so why should
it matter if they get the ax when the highest--
visibility programs are happy? A

A majority of college athletic programs
lose money; only 22 of 227 Division I pro-

' grams made money this past year. Guess

which sports lose the most money? Anybody
who has ever seen Heinz Field only half-
ﬁlled on a Saturday afternoon can make
the connection. ' A

Maryland, in the end, will make much ,

more money in the Big Ten. Who could blame
them for jumping at the chance to nearly
double their athletics revenue? But will that
money be used to reinstate the smaller pro-

_ grams that are cut? Forget about it. It will

only serve to fatten wallets. ﬂ

ULTIMATE

ogy, while Y lost to Cornell. Rutgers’ A—team
+ which was the ﬁrst college team to play an
Ultimate game in 1972 — also bested both
Pitt squads. Last year, Rutgers made it to the

” V quarterﬁnals of its regional tournament but

failed to qualify for Nationals.

“The Rutgers [tournament] gave the team a
chance to build relationships and chemistry,”
Kaczmarek said. “It is also a time for the guys
to begin deﬁning the culture of the new team.”

The entire squad came home after the tour-
nament and sorted out ﬁnal cuts. Seven new
players would join the A-team, resulting in a
total of 26 members on the squad. This year’s
captains are seniors Zach Kauffman and Isaac

Saul and junior Aaron Watson.
The ﬁrst ofﬁcial practice for the team was’

held Oct. 22, but it has been preparing since
the summer. With a championship under their
belts, the players understand that other teams
will be doing whatever they can to knock them
off their pedestal. They got a taste of that at
the pre-season tournament. - ~
According to junior Tyler Kunsa, Pitt Ul-
timate is conditioning much harder than last
year. Players are working with alumni trainers
at the Fitzgerald Field House to take the steps
needed to improve on their recent success.
They began their track sessionsa couple weeks
earlier than last year and have been lifting
weights since they arrived at Pitt this semester.
"‘We are already better than last year,”

Kunsa said. “We have two of our best play- .

ers returning in [senior] Alex Thorne and
[sophomore] Max Thorne.”

Kauffman believes that this year’s sopho-
mores are one of the most talented classes in
Pitt Ultimate’s history.

“I fully expect these starting spots to be
taken by some of these sophomores,” Kauff—
man said. Speciﬁcally, Kauffman pointed out
Christian Pitts andjoe Bender as players who

it llstima

is urrently conducting clinical trials in the followig areas:

have improved “exponentially” this offseason.
Pitt Ultimate does have large shoes to ﬁll,

however. After winning the national cham-

pionship last year, the team no longer has
former senior captain Colin Conner or ﬁfth-
yearjulian Hausman on its roster.

The duo’s defensive play was essential in
the ﬁnal weekend of last season. After fall-
ing down 8-3 in the ﬁrst half of the national
semiﬁnal match, it was Hausman and Conner
who brought intensity to Pitt’s defense and
sparked a 9-2 run.

“After losing them, we’re deﬁnitely looking
for a few players to step up their defensive
game this year,” sophomore Dan Wickens said.

One of those players could be freshman '

Carl Morgenstern, whose defensive skills
earned him a position on the A-team. Mor-

vgenstern, from the Pittsburgh area, played on

the Allderdice High School Ultimate team and
was coached by Kaczmarek this past summer
for the Impulse, Pittsburgh’s youth team.

“I certainly expect him to contribute,” Kac-

T zmarek said of Morgenstern. “Of course, same

goes for all of our freshmen. It’s go time from

year one.” , . V

The A-team began its quest to repeat

on Nov. Io at the University of Missouri at ’ '

the Missouri Loves Company tournament,
in which it went 7-1,_including a forfeit win
over Texas. '

The campaign continued a little bit closer
to home at the Steel Cityshowdown, hosted

by Carnegie Mellon on Nov. 18. That Satur-

day marked the ﬁrst time in four years that
Pitt actually competed in Pittsburgh. It went
2-1, beating Ohio State and Ohio but losing
to CMU, 13-9. ,

The team’s results at this early point in the
season seem to reinforce Kunsa’s appraisal
of the squad. -

“We can’t be too conﬁdent, but I like our

‘ chances this season,” he said. I

the responsibility of facilitating the offense,
ending the game with a game—high eight as-
sists to go along with 11 points.

Despite shooting 40.9 percent from the
ﬁeld as a unit entering Tuesday night’s game
against Pitt, the Bison (1-6) rode a hot start
from the ﬁeld to lead the home team for the
majority of the ﬁrst half. But Pitt managed to
4‘ ' go into the break with a 36-28 lead, due in

large part to the six three-pointers knocked
down by Patterson and Robinson.

While Pitt knocked down those threes,
Howard went to work on the inside against
the likes of Steven Adams, Talib Zanna and

Dante Taylor. With Howard’s largest player,
Alphonso Leary, measuring 6’10” and weigh-
ing only 200 pounds, Pitt ﬁgured to literally
hold a sizable edge on the inside.

But the penetration efforts of guard Sim-
uel Frazier and forward Mike Phillips, along-
side the interior presence provided by Leary,
played a huge role in the Bison’s dominat-
ing performance in the painted area against
Pitt, as-they tallied 24 points in the paint, as
compared to the Panthers’ 10. Howard also
out-rebounded Pitt, 17-16, in the ﬁrst half.

Robinson cited the successful penetrative
efforts of the Bison in creating a number
of offensive" rebounding opportunities for
Howard. A

“In the ﬁrst half, we gave up a lot of drives,
which gave up weak—side boards, putting our

bigs at a disadvantage,” Robinson said.

If not for Pitt’s success from the three
in the ﬁrst half, making 6-10,, the Panthers
could have found themselves in a lot of trou-
ble as they struggled against the zone look
Howard threw at them’, especially when try-
ing to penetrate. This was the goal of Bison
head coach Kevin Nickelberry, who wanted to
slow the game down to control the tempo and
the paint, as well, with Pitt’s size advantage.

“We wanted to control the paint with
zone, make them make 8 or 9 passes and
think about it,” Nickelberry said.

But in the second half, Pitt came out
strong and extended its halftime lead to
double—digits within just more than a min-
ute of the second half —— starting with Zanna
scoring three quick points on a free throw

urday at 7 p.m. at the Petersen Events Center

and 1ay—up.

From there, the Panthers never looked
back, opening up a lead enumerating as much
as 26 points at one point in the second half
and coasting to victory.

Zanna — who ﬁnished with 12 points and
eight rebounds —— said the biggest difference
in the second half was the mentality shared by
the Panthers coming out of the locker room.

“In the ﬁrst half we came out ﬂat—footed
 in the second we came out focused,” Zanna
said. “James [Robinson] got a lot of guys open
shots, and that’s how we got the lead.”

The Panthers held the Bison to only 30.8
percent shooting on 8-26 from the ﬁeld in
the second frame, after Howard connected
on 14-28 attempts in the ﬁrst half. More im-
portantly, after Howard’s interior success,
Pitt locked down the key, giving up only 10
points in the paint andmatching the Bison

in rebounding at 20 boards apiece in the A

second half.

Despite Pitt’s better interior performance
inthe second half, head coach Jamie Dixon
still expressed displeasure with the team’s
rebounding ability, especially after seeing
the Panthers get out—rebounded for the third
consecutive game.

“[Rebounding] really stands out,” Dixon
said. “It’s something that should be a strength
of ours right now, but it isn’t.”

Dixon attributed some of the lack of re-
bounding to the increase in turnovers the
Panthers have forced this season, thus cre-
ating fewer opportunities for defensive re-
bounds. Tuesday, Pitt forced the Bison into
committing 17 turnovers and scored 12 points
off those mistakes. _

By the end of the matchup, Pitt simply had
worn down the Bison —- who were missing
three players due to injury and had only seven
scholarship players on the roster

“We gotta get better. There’s no question
about it. I’d hoped we’d get better today, and
that’s where we’re at,” Dixon said.

The Panthers will take on'Detroit this Sat-
