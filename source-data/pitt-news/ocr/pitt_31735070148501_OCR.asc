Depression
on the rise
among  
college    
students

'(I-‘egan Hanlon
Assistant'News Editor

Pitt’s Counseling Center becomes
more popular post-Labor Day
as classes pick up and the work
piles on for students according
to local psychologists and the
University.

The University offers infor-
mation sessions, runs campaigns
and promotes awareness of the
counseling and student services
offered at Pitt in light of an in-
crease in depression at univer-
sities across the country in the
past few years. _

“There’s been a recognition
across thenation that we’re in-
creasingly seeing depression on
college campuses,” Ellen Frank,
a Pitt psychology and psychia-

i try professor, said. About 1,100

college studentscommit suicide
each year.

The University of California,
Los Angeles, released an annual
study injanuary that reported a
record drop in emotional—health
levels of first-year college stu-
dents. ’ .

In 2010, 51.9 percent of stu-
dents reported that their emo-
tional health was “above aver-
age,” compared to 55.3 percent
in 2009 and 63.6 percent in 1985,
the first year of the study.

Frank said the increase in
cases of depression might stem
from less of a stigma surround-
ing depression or professionals
becoming more skilled at recog-
nizing the disorder.

“It might be adapting to dor-

EBooks still receive lukewarm response

Brendan Owens
Staff Writer

Despite high hopes for e_Books at The
Book Center; sales have ﬂatlined in the
past year, an issue that The Center’s
manager said might stem from confu-
sion aboutthe program. '

EBooks became available in fall '

2010 .at The Book Center in order to
help students save money on text-
books. Even though eBooks are now
awtilable for certaintextbooks andcan
be purchased at nearly halfthe price of
a physical book, the electronic books
make up less than 1 percent of overall
Book Center sales, said Book Center
manager Debra Fyock. _ ’
The number of eBooks available for
purchase has increased each semester
at The Book Center, but the number
of eBooks sold has not changed since
January 2011. The Book Center cur-
rently offers more than 600 different

     THE EEKENDSTA

eBook titles.

Fyock said she is pleased with the
new program and would like to see it
continue to grow. Fyock cited lower
prices and more convenience as rea-

sons to boost the program

“We see eBooksasofferinganother

optiontoourstudentcustorners,along 1

with new, used, rental and guaranteed
buyback selections,” Fyock said.
EBook sales still representless than
1 percent of the Center’s overall book
sales. Fyock said tl1at.the lack of sales
could also be attributed to the newness
of tlie program, as well as companies

' not yet offering an eBook alternative,

though the number of eBooks available
has increased each semesteras aresult
of publishers steadily making more of
their titles available in eBook format.
Student Government Board pres-
ident Molly Stieber said she spear-
headed the project after conducting
research prior to her 2010 SGB cam-

paign

Is 0NiHURY.IURN

She received positive feedback
on the eBook project and has found
that they are in high demand from

_ students. .

Stieber’s motivation stemmed from
the heavy costs that textbooks inﬂict
on students’ wallets. In her research,
she found that eBooks could save
students hundreds of dollars a year
depending on their courseload. ,

“I don’t think anyone could dis-
agree that textbook costs are almost

impossible to handle for the average

college student,” Stieber said. “I did

a ton of research and discovered that 1
electronic textbooks canbe purchased '

at halfthe cost of a newly printed text-
book.”
For example,’ an Introduction to

I -Psychology student could buy a new 4

edition of “Psychology” by Saundra
Ciccarelli at the print price of $162.65
at The Book Center, or the student
could purchase the eBook for $65.10.
Stieber noted that she purchaseda

of digital books is supplied mainly
through textbook providgr Courses-

‘ mart, which offers 90 percent of all

core textbooks used in higher educa-
tion, according to its website.

Stieber said that it is also impor-
tant for students to realize that they
carmot sell back their eBooks at the
end ofthe semester like they would be
abletowith physical textbooks. When
students sell their books back, they

usually get about half the price.they »

originally paid.

Fyock said The Book Center will
continue to research and consider all
options that fulﬁll departmental re-

preventing the sale of eBooks is if the

an option for the book.

Green,Team encourages student sustainability

Kelly Lyons
For The Pitt News

Pitt has sprouted a new green initiative this
semester, although its growth has slowed since
move—in. Pitt organized the Green Team, this
fall, led by Residence Life, the Office of First
Year Experience, Housing and Dining Services
and Student Affairs. The pilot program is meant
to make students more environmentally con-
scious and more aware of sustainability efforts
on campus.

Resident Director Amy Reed has played a
big role in getting the program running this
semester with fellow Resident Directors Matt
Landy and Xavier Blackwell, as well as Pat Hef-
ﬂey, the recycling coordinator of Housing and
Dining Services, and Mary Utter, coordinator
of First Year Experience. The 100-member
Green Team is composed of this year’s incom-
ing freshmen.

Reed said she established the program to

give “ﬁrst-year students an opportunity to have
an immediate leadership position on campus”
while being environmentally friendly.

So far, the team hosted their only event dur-
ing freshman move-in at the end of August,
where they recycled cardboard moving boxes
and handed out recycling ﬂyers. While the group
led one large campaign at the beginning of the
year, it’s in the middle of a break until it thinks
of a new project.

Incoming freshmen were emailed over the
summer to ask if they would like to partici-
pate, Pitt Green Team member Kristen Rupnik
said.

Rupnik said shethinks it is important to stay
environmentally conscious, but “I try not to be

‘ obsessive about it.”

Reed said the 105 freshmen involved in the
group, who were the first ones to respond to the
email, moved in one day early in August and at-
tended a mandatory two-hour training session
duringwhich they met their fellow Green Team
members and learned more about the group.

Each student was assigned afour-hour shift
during the ﬁrst day of freshman move-in where
they either volunteered to give out informational
ﬂyers containing recycling facts orvolunteered
at cardboard—recycling stations. The stations
were located at Forbes, Lothrop and Sutherland
Halls and on the Litchﬁeld Towers patio.

Students who chose to recycle received $5
coupons for The Pitt Shop or 10 percent off
purchases at Maggie & Stella’s Cards 8: Gifts.

Reed said the coupons were “our way of
giving back to people for recycling.”

But students said the event was not very
successful.

Rupnik, who volunteered at Lotl1rop’s card-
board recycling station, said they “had a lot of
coupons left” at the end of the day and said
that Green Team volunteers “basically just sat
there.’_’

Freshman Brian Nelson agreed with Rup-
nik’s assessment. Nelson said that people were

walking around with “mostly just ﬂyers” and .

had.

Other students were assigned to hand out
recycling information sheets, which were not
printed on 100 percent recyclable paper, Reed
said. She assumed that the paper would be re-
cycled, but was surprised that it couldn’t be
recycled afterward.

But Rupnik said the event “was a really good
idea. We kind of want to tryto do more on stuff
on campus.”

The team had its first meeting since move-in
day on Sept. 11, with the goal of continuing to
generate awareness on campus about how to be
more environmentally friendly. Reed said the
students involved’ “were still very excited.”

Reed said thatfor ﬁiuire plans, she would like
to include the Student Government Board. '

Reed plans on giving the same opportunity .

of joining the team to the freshman class of
2016.

tions,” Reed said. I - ’

Start of term a busy time
for Counseling Center

Depression 4 1

mitory living or group living  leaving
the structure life of the family for the un-
structured life on the college campus,”
Frank said of the possible causes of de-
pression. .

Shawn Brooks, associate dean of stu-
dents and director of Student Life, said
Pitt offered extended orientation sessions
to first-year students at the start of the
year at which resident assistants spoke
to their floors about issues related to aca-
demic, financial, physical and emotional
wellness..

“What We are essentially trying to con-
vey to our students is that it is everyone’s
responsibility to look out for all mem-
bers of the Pitt community,” he said in
an email.

Brooks said that historically the Coun-
seling Center, located in the William Pitt
Union, is very busy at the start of every
academic year because of students deal-
ing with homesickness and transition
problems.

New director of the Counseling Center
Tevya Zukor, said in an email that students
in an emergency situation can meet with a
counselor immediately and bypass the wait
that he said is normally about one week to
ten days for a scheduled appointment.

“;.. but we are in the process of imple-

menting a new appointment system so
that students can be seen for the first time
within two or three days,” he said adding
that the Center also finds themselves very
busy in October and November as well.

Zukor said that to cover the busiest
times of the year, four part-time staff mem-
bers were hired to assist the ten full—time
counseling staff made up of psychologists,
social workers and counselors. The Center
also has two psychiatrists, two Post-docs
and three interns working there.

These peak times were echoed by An-

, tonia Macpherson, a psychiatrist and

executive director of LEAD, a Pittsburgh

organization that focuses on promoting

education and awareness of depression
on college campuses.

Macpherson said that the nonprofit
started talks about setting up a depression-
awareness program with Pitt in 2008.

“It’s nowevolved into ‘Talk About It,”’
Macpherson said. “LEAD was very sup-
portive and still is of the campaign.”

Senior psychology majorsjessica Still-
man and Allison Domalski are co-chairs of
“Talk About It: Give Depression a Voice,”
along with junior Nikki Surmacy.

Stillman said the goal of the year-round
awareness campaign is to fight the stigma
often associated with depression so that
students seek the help they need. The ini-
tiative’s members do this by getting the
word out about the signs of depression and

ways the Counseling Center can help.

Signs of depression include withdrawal
from society, a loss of interest in things
or a period of sadness that lasts for more
than six months. .

Student representatives table in Towers
Lobby every Monday, offering informa-
tion on Pitt’s Counseling Center to those
passing by and distributing hundreds of
T-shirts to get out the Counseling Center’s
information.

Another depression program that could
be coming to Pitt is the LEAD—developed
SCoRE curriculum. Macpherson said
SCORE teaches college-aged students how
to be resilient when faced with stress.

————- so
...It is everyone’s
responsibility to

look out for all
members of the Pitt
community.
—ShaWn Brooks

--————   99-——-

The curriculum’s different stages teach
students self—care, how to identify a sup-
port system, the ins and outs of resilience
and how to manage stress reactions.‘

“You hear everyone running around a
college campus saying, ‘I’m so stressed,
I’m so stressed,”’ Macpherson said, noting

 

that a person needs to draw the line for

himself between the realm of dai1y—hassle
stress and disabling stress. -

. The curriculum has already been imple-
mented in some way —- whether as a man-
datory or optional course — at Chatham,
Robert Morris, Carnegie Mellon and Car-
low universities.

Pitt spokesman Shawn Ahearn said the
University is currently considering options
for how to implement the program.

“Right now, it’s premature to discuss
how Pitt may choose to incorporate the
SCoRE curriculum,” he said in an email.

‘Brooks said students that feel they
might be depressed or know someone
who is depressed should talk to their RA
or seek counseling support.

“It can be a disabling illness,” Macpher-
son said. “But it does not have to remain a
disabling illness, It’s important to recog-
nize those symptoms and get help.” I

eBooks include missing the feeling of turning
pages in a book, though she had tremendously
positive feedback from students who gave the

She said she believes that eBooks are the
ﬁiture of textbooks and thinks that the more
prevalent mobile devices become, the larger the
increase in popularity to follow.

“I would like to see students give eBooks a
chance,” Stieber said. “I understand that they
aren’t for everyone, but the fact that I only have
to carry around my iPad to read almost all of
my textbooks for all of my classes has made my
academic life so much easier.”

Another reason Pitt students may enjoy the

GOP~vote measure
reprehensible  

Few people besides Rick Santorum
believe he can win the presidential
election. If one of his proposals
takes effect, however, he might just
win it for somebody else. .
Backed by Pennsylvania Repub-
licans like Senate Majority Leader
Dominic Pileggi, Santorum has
championed revamping our state’s
Electoral College. Unfortunately
—~ like many of the candidate’s
previous initiatives —— it comes at

the expense of the average voter. .

Pennsylvania will have 20 elec-
toral votes in the 2012 election*;
one less than in 2008. As it stands,
when a Presidential candidate

A wins the state’s popular vote, he or

she receives all the electoral votes.
Under Santorum’s plan, however,‘
each congressionaldistrict would
be assigned an electoral vote, and a
candidate would claim one per dis-
trict that swings in his or her favor.
Maine and Nebraska already em-
ploy this system, but other states, A
like Colorado, have tried and failed
to implement somethingsimilar.
Pennsylvania, largely thanks to
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, has
roughly 1 million more registered
Democrats than it does Republi-
cans. A majority of our districts,
however, lean red. Therefore, if
we’d adopted the above model
three years ago, Obama would
have collected only 11 of our state’s
then—21 votes. Accordingly, it’s
no surprise that the Pennsylva-
nia GOP ——-’ which controls both
houses and the 'Governor’s man-
sion — ﬁnds the plan appealing.
Governor Tom Corbett has voiced

’ his support.

Some legislators, like Pileggi,

   

Tliink we’

Sencl (.1 l()ll'(3 r

assure voters that the measure is
civic-minded. Santorum, forlonce,
is not so disingenuous. Accord-
ing to Slate.com’s David Weigel,
the former Pennsylvania Senator
raved that, under this system, “Re—
publicans will come out ahead in
every election  All of a sudden, a

Republican can win— and would .

probably routinely win ——- allbut

. three or four congressional dis-

tricts in Pennsylvania.”
However, even if you’re a mem-

ber of the GOP, Santorum’s plan -

is not in your best interests. If it
takes effect, the redistricting of
Pennsylvania is likely to become
a politicized ordeal. National-
level special interest groups will
bombard us with advertisements
urging us to ask legislators for dis-
trict boundaries that favor certain
demographics —— and thus, certain
parties.

We’re even more concerned
about the precedent this would
set. If politicians were to retool
the state’s voting process every
four years to beneﬁt their party,
we’d wind up with a population
continually subject to reshuffling.
Fair representation -— if it_ were
ever a principle politicians held in
esteem —— would almost certainly
become an afterthought.

Vote manipulation is an ines-
capable reality when it comes to
elections. Nevertheless, we hope
Pennsylvanians will recognize
Santorum and Pileggi’s proposal
for what it is — a transparent ma-‘
neuver — and somehow ensure
that our legislators know we aren’t
pleased.

Hard vs. soft-shell tacos: A
resolution is ﬁnally reached

   
  

, 2...-.. ..——— V

Elizabeth Weisel
For The Pitt News

There is a divide in our diners, a
schism in our supermarkets, a rift
in our restaurants, a fracture in our
food. This split revolves around one
question: hard— or soft-shell taco?
The battle for supremacy be-
tween the two wraps has yet to
be resolved. But which one is bet-
ter quality? The question merits
examination in three categories:
handling, taste and texture.

The ﬁrst round will evaluate the '

handling of the taco in relation to
its ingredients and its eater. The
soft shell’s main advantage is the
way it skillfully wraps itself around
its ﬁlling to minimize the loss of in-
gredients. Assuming that the taco is
ﬁlled to thejbrim with meat, lettuce,
cheese,‘salsa and even guacamole, a
solid base is necessary for strength.
It lessens the need for napkins and

allows for smooth eating.

The hard~shell taco takes a bit
more ﬁnesse to handle. Although its
solid exterior forms a perfect base
to successfully pocket any ingredi-
ent thrown its way and the condi-

V ments sit in the shell like books on

a shelf, ready to be lifted and eaten,
the likelihood for spillage is greater.
Thus, the taco must be handled
carefully to keep its insides intact.
If there’s a particularly bad blowvto
the shell it will crack, though con-
diments such as guacamole work
wonderfully as adhesives so it can
get back in the game.

In the battle of handling, then,
the soft shell has the advantage due
to its wrapping abilities. Things
may change in the next round, how-
ever, when we examine taste.

' The positive aspect of the soft
shell isthat the doughy taste of the
tortilla-brings out the rich ingredi-

ents. However, the tortilla ﬂavor ‘

can become a detriment if taken

too far. Sometimes it’s simply too
dull and overpowers the spicy in-
gredients with its blandness. The
tortilla is both the handicap and the
advantage for the soft shell.

The argument for the hard shell
is simple: It has more salt. And if

American cooking has taught us '

anything, it’s that a little more salt
makes everything taste better. The
spices of the shell complement the
ﬂavors held inside and add an extra
kick to their punch. Yet, the ﬂavor.
of the hard shell does not over-
whelm the taco because it brings
to mind tortilla chips, which are
already tailored to match salsa,
guacamole and even meat.

It’s clear that the hard—shell taco
wins the battle of taste. One more
round examining texture will break
the tie and determine the better
shell. T

The soft-shell taco relies on a

foundation of the ﬂat, malleable
tortilla to maintain its shape. How-
ever, over a long period of time a
soft—shell taco will ﬁnd itself going,
well, soft. The thin shell becomes
soggy with the juices of its innards
and starts to lose its grip around
its ﬁlling. Then when it ﬁnally gets
eaten, the bite turns into mush in
your mouth and the taco lacks any
deﬁning texture.

The hard shell, on the other
hand, is all about the crunch -
that precious sound heard in Kit
Kat commercials, from the guy
eating popcorn behind you at the
movie theater or in the ﬁrst bite of
an apple. As eaters, we savor the
crunch, the satisfying tone that tells
us we have made a dent in our meal,
that we are on our way to quelling

our hunger. The crunch is aural
proof that we are actively eating,
that we are interacting with our
meal. When you order a taco with
a hard shell, you are ordering an
experience.

It is therefore the crunch that

‘ wins the last battle for the hard-

shell taco. Though the soft—shell
taco had the advantage in handling,
it might as well just be a fajita or
burrito. The hard shell is declared
winner of the match by its explosive
taste and crunchy texture. .

And thus the schism is sealed,
the rift is repaired, the fracture is
fused and the hard shell taco has.
emerged as superior.

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

This letter is in response to your Sept. 19 article, “Ofﬁcials push
for new Carnegie Library funding.” I am a graduate student and I use
the Carnegie libraries all the time. I don’t live near campus, so I really
beneﬁt from having a quiet study place near home. I would like to see
more hours of library operation, not less! It’s a shame that the library in
Squirrel Hill often closes at 5 p.m., so I can only use it on the weekends or
when I have a day off. The libraries really need to set up an endowment
so they can depend on stable funding in the future. This tax initiative
is a good start; at $2.09 a month. it’s cheaper than renting one DVD or
buyingone book. Everyone needs to vote “yes” on the library referen-
dum this November, and then make sure the libraries start building an
endowment so they can avoid funding crises in the future. This small tax
now can be the seed that allows the libraries to build a self-sustaining
budget, ensuring these important centers of community learning can
survive indeﬁnitely. -

To the Editor,

After reading the Sept. 19 .ar—

ticle “Officials push for new Car-

negie Library funding,” I wanted
to give a student’s opinion on the
Carnegie Library’s ﬁnancial situa-
tion. The Carnegie Library is the
perfect place to study. The Hillman
Library is always"packed, and even
if you manage to ﬁnd a table, it’s too
loud to concentrate. The Carnegie
Library is a much better environ-
ment, plus the building is beautiful.
The Carnegie Library also provides
free access to test prep books, which
can be expensive.

The Carnegie Library is an es-
sentialpart of our community, and
losing it would be atragedy. Iwant to
save our library, so I amvoting “yes”
onthe referendum pn Nov. 8.

Ti”; hot yoga for (1

Written By Sarah Simkin

Thursday night found me sprawled
on my living room ﬂoor, looking
like I’d just trekked through the
Sahara and possibly been hit by a

train — the result of my ﬁrst time

at hot yoga.
If you think of yoga involves
lounging around on mats, think

again. It’s a full workout, especially ”

when practiced in rooms heated
to 90 F, like in the classes offered
at Amazing Yoga in Shadyside and
South Side. Temperatures can
even reach 105 F for practitioners
of Bikram yoga. The sauna—like at-
mosphere is meant to be relaxing
and allow for deeper stretching.
To me, that sounded a bit‘ like
the perfect storm for dehydration

assured me that hot yoga is “really

those who are pregnant or have a

Homison explained that the more
ﬂexible and healthy the body is, the
less pain it feels. Hot yoga has been
said to reduce stress, improve sleep,
increase energy levels and boost the
immune and endocrine systems. I
had to ﬁnd out for myself.

I took my ﬁrst class at Amaz-
ing Yoga on Copeland Street in
Shadyside. Some of my fears about
how difficult the class was going

entered the studio. It was an open
space with wooden ﬂoors, like a
dance studio, and soothingly low
lighting, and I saw students of all
ages spread out on their mats. If

Hot yoga is intense and, like
with any exercise, you should check
with your doctor to make sure it’s
safe.

One of the neat things about
yoga is that it can be constantly
tweaked to suit any skill level. The
class was listed as ‘all levels,’ and
the instructor offered suggestions
for modiﬁcations on most poses
to increase the difficulty for bored
experts or make them easier for
those of us that were still ﬁghting

MOVIE REVIEW

'50/50' charming, funny

Written By Liz Keeney

50/50 I
Starring] oseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen
Directed byjonathan Levine

A.

Adam Lerner sits in his doctor’s ofﬁce, tapping
hisfeet against theﬂooras he waits for the doctor
to come in and tell himthat he hurthis back run-
ning and might need surgery to put things back
in place. Instead, the doctor arrives to tell Adam
that he has a rare form of spinal cancer— one
with a 50/50 shot of survival.

And so we arrive at the crux o “50/50,” a
story about a 27~year—old cancer patient who
bites his nails and can’t drive. The ﬁlm, directed
byjonathan Levine and based loosely on screen-
writer Will Reiser’s own experience with can-
cer, takes a lighthearted and almost-comedic
approach to the leading cause of death in the
United States. While there’s nothing ﬁmny about
an actual cancer diagnosis, the ﬁlm manages to
be emotional without veering into “Terms of
Endearment” levels of sappiness.

Joseph Gordon—Levitt stars as Adam, and
while the part was originally written forjames
McAvoy, it might as well have been written for
him. Gordon—Levitt is charmingly awkward as
always, grinning sheepishly and joking his way
through his character’s initial diagnosis. ‘But
when things get serious, Gordon—Levitt proves
that his acting isn’t limited to playing the ador-
able nerd college—age girls have come to love him
for. On .the other hand, Sethgiiogen, who plays
Adam’s best friend Kyle, is  top Rogen form
-— which isn’t saying much. ' e Rogen’s crass

humor works for most of the ﬁlm, it becomes
grating afterawhile. '

The breakout star, however, is Anna Kend-
rick, who plays Adam’s psychologist-in-training.

I She is working toward her doctorate and Adam

is only her third patient. Kendrick manages to
capture the excruciatingly—awkward—yet—self—irn—
portant bravado of a med student, which hasn’t
been done quite as well in ﬁlm before now.

While the early scenes between Gordon-
Levitt and Rogen are ﬁmny, they get dull after a
while, as Kyle’s constant attempts to use Adam’s
diagnosis to pick up girls quickly grow old. And
although both Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick
are well-suited for their roles, they have little
on~screen chemistry. Adam’s sessions with his
therapist are supposed to appear awkward, but
they don’t have to be so boring.

It’s really the subtler moments in “50/5 0”
that give the movie its heart. The scenes when
Adam interacts with fellow cancer patients are
sweet, yet ﬁmny. In these moments you can really
see screenwriter Reiser’s personal experience
with cancer shine through, but the most tear-
inducing moments are between Adam and his
father, who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease.

What “50/50” does best is play on the
younger generation’s fear that the rug will get
pulled out from under them. Adam is a young
manwith amediocre job, anoverbearing mother,
an annoyingbest friend andacheaﬁng girlfriend,
when suddenly he is faced with cancer. Younger
patrons — especially those intheirzos — might
appreciate thepﬁlm more for its honest mes-
sage. . ’

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Straw Dogs’ has strong visuals, too many stereotypes

VV/ritten By Patrick VVagner

“Straw Dogs”

Directed by Rod Lurie
Starring: James Marsden,
Kate Bosworth, Alexander
Skarsgard

Grade: B+

When Sam Peckinpah made the

‘ original “Straw Dogs” in 1971, it

was seen as an indictment of man-
kind’s inherently violent nature
— set in the English countryside.
With Rod Lurie’s remake, the set-
ting is changed to Texas — man-
kind remains the same,

This might not be Sam Peck-
inpah’s movie, but the new “Straw
Dogs” is a worthy rendering of
a classic, only hampered by the
relatively outdated plot. It steps
out of the norms of a thriller and
into the realm of psychological
drama. _

In an attempt to ﬁnd peace
and quiet write a script about the
Battle of Stalingrad, small—time
Hollywood writer David Sumner
(James Marsden) and his actress

' - abit more like caricatures inthe .

wife, Amy (Kate Bosworth), move
back to her rural hometown in the
Deep South. Although most of the
townspeople are hospitable, the
“straw dogs,” ex-football players
led by local war hero Charlie (Al-
exander Skarsgard), create more

than mischief while ﬁxing David’s _

barn.
Althoughrthe characters feel

2011 version, the cast gives them
much more than a comedic treat-
ment. Bosworth and Skarsgard,
in particular, tackle difficult roles

with ease — each contributing a -

powerful performance as a char-
acter that is inherently hard to
play. '

The cinematography brings
this startling vision of the South
to life, and uses natural scenery to
enhance the ﬁlm’s sense of horror.
Non—linear collage effects and or-
chestral music also help to create

a tremendous sense of intensity, ,

although not without a few short-
comings.

Whereas the characters them-
selves are excellent, the stereo-
types seem a bit extreme. Fur-
thermore, the exact dynamics of
the town and a few mysterious
details are left unanswered. The
missing pieces take away from the
powerful impact the American
South can have as a setting and
make the town come off rather

--‘,‘D.eliverance”-like.1. «  

Structurally, the film over
comes thriller-genre cliches well,
and doesn’t reveal its violent hand
until about the last half—hour. For
a ﬁlm with such lurid gore, it’s
not overdone,»and — despite the
presence of fake blood — it’s not
farcical in the least.

Although “Straw Dogs” deliv-
ers a strong story in a visually
powerful way, the movie’s suc-
cess is ultimately hampered by
its inability to create consistent,
dynamic characters in a consis-
tent, dynamic world. However, in
terms of remakes, it stands out as
a clear success. m

Courtesy Sony Pictures
“Straw Dogs” is a remake of the 1971 original directed by Sam Peck-
inpah, but takes place in the South instead of England.

concerned.
Did it live up to the hype? It probably isn’t

eve1'y0ne’s cup of tea, butI certainly left feel- " I5

ing limber and in a near—comatose state of

relaxation. I would highly advise against 

making plans after class, because I was dy-
ing to jump in the shower and too physically
drained to leave my couch for the rest of the
evening.

How sore you’ll be the next day depends
on your pre—existing ﬂexibility and what pose

the instructor prefers to work out of. In class, ‘ 
my instructor favored constantly returning ~

to Downward—Facing Dog, a pose requiring
equal weight distribution on your hands and
feet. Fifty percent of my body mass is more
weight than I care to have my arms bear for
any length of time, and I had accordingly sore
deltoids andbiceps the next day.

I What do you need to know before you try
it yourself? Be sure to bring a towel, possibly
two —’ one to wipe off with, one to spread
over your yoga mat — and the all—important
water bottle. “Be ready to sweat,” said Conley.
If you’re not-prepared, you’ll get dehydrated,
because you’re going to sweat an amount that

’ transcends being gross —~— it’ll just become

astonishing. Trendy yoga workout wear isn’t
required, any clothing you can move in com-
fortably is ﬁne. Be sure to show up early so you

have time to register and settle in —« rushing ‘

into yoga class will probably create counter-
productive stress for you, and it also might
disturb yourclassmates’ concentration. To
avoid this situation, some studios lock the
doors after classes start. ,

Most studios also have packages, which
often offer lower prices per class. Drop—in
rates at Amazing Yoga are $11 for students,
but ﬁve class packs can be purchased for $45.
Initially, I had trouble trying to rationalize
the cost against the price of working out at
the Petersen, but hot yoga is a totally differ:
ent experience, from the communal aspect
to the type of workout. I was prepared to be
cynicalabout the spiritual aspects of yoga,

but the reverberations of 40 people saying I 

“Om” in unison are actually pretty cool and
calming. I - "

FOOTBALL

Chris Fanelli
Staff Writer

Three games into the 2011 foot-
ball season, the Pitt Panthers
sit at an underwhelming 2-1,
and the only consistency has
been a lack of fourth-quarter
production.

The Panthers have been able
to hold all three oftheir oppo-
nents to no points in the first
quarter, and are consistently
successful in coming out of the
gates strong on defense. Unfor-
tunately, they haven’t been able
to bookend strong first-quarter
production with strong fourth-
quarter production.

. Against opponents like Buf-
falo and Maine, they were able
to sneak by and come away
with wins, but Pitt football’s
loss this past weekend against
Iowa came down to a team-wide
breakdown in the fourth quar-
ter.

That breakdown is sup-
ported by the numbers: The
Panthers have been outscored
41-24 in the fourth quarter, and
this week marks the start of the
tough part of their schedule.

After Saturday’s game,

against. Notre Dame, which
head coach Todd Graham called
“the best offense we’ve seen yet
this season,” the Panthers will
jump into conference play.

Five days after Notre Dame,
Pitt starts its Big East sched-
ule against the South Florida
Bulls. If the Panthers’ poor
performance during the fourth
quarter isn’t turned around
this week in practice, the‘sea-
son could take a turn for the
worse.

“There is no excuse in howv
. ,we’re finishing the games,”

§Graham said. “Simply put: We
have to get better.”

’ Some have said, including
members of the media, that the
team is still transitioning to
Graham’s up—tempo style, but
the players are saying that’s

-;not the case.

 “Truthfully, I think that

transition is over, especially
now that we got a couple games
under"our belt,” junior wide
receiver Mike Shanahan said.
“We know what to expect dur-
ing games and we know that
now all we have to do is keep
working at it and keep trying
to get better everyday.”

The prevailing attitude
around the Panthers’ complex
is that theyjust need to execute
better. The coaching system is
now in place, and it’s a system
that has worked for Graham at
other schools where the talent
of the players isn’t on the level
that it is here.

“It’s come down to execu-
tion,”-Shanahan added. “We’ve

got to focus in and dig deeper,

in the fourth quarter, because
that’s when games are won and
lost.”

The theme of practice all
week has been “owning the ball
on offense and getting take-
aways on defense,” Graham
said on Wednesday. Hand in
hand with this mentality is a
focus on playing hard for the
full four quarters, Graham add-
ed. The players are aware this
is a situation that isn’t easy to
imitate, since practice is often

' stopped to implement different‘

wrinkles in the game plan. One
of the main focuses of offsea-
son workouts was for the team
to be in better condition than

their opponents, which would

leadto the team winning the
fourth quarter.

Redshirt senior defensive
tackle Myles Caragein is lead-
ing the charge for Pitt’s men-
tality change.

“This week we’ve really been
emphasizing finish,” Caragein
said. “I know it’s hard to simu-
l_ate ﬁnishing out a fourth quar-

is in spite of the fact they won

BASKETBALL

Shayla Scott moves 

on to coaching

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

Shayla Scott, a former Pitt bas-
ketball player, has found a new
basketball home. -

La Salle University in Phila-
delphia has hired her as an as-
sistant basketball coach. She
will work primarily with the
Explorers’ post players.

“In terms of what I can bring
tocLa Salle from Pitt in regards
to basketball situations, I am
very proud to say I played in
the Big East Conference,” Scott
said. “In this conference we

competed against some of the-
best teams in the country, day
in and day out.”

Scott will get the opportuni-
ty to work with a talented group
of four freshmen forwards,
two of them - Indigo Dickens
and Ruvanna Campbell — were“
nominated for the McDonalds
All-American team.

La Salle head coachjeffWil—
liams expressed his excitement
at adding Scott to his coaching
staff. The coach should know}.
what he’s getting, considering
the fact he coached Scott at Pitt
for three years. Williams left

TAS5ER’S TAKE

Edn’t expect the
quarterbacks to cruise

2 Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

Two weeks into the football season and
this has already been dubbed the “Year of
the Quarterback.” Considering the pro-
digious passing numbers put up thus far
— and by somesurprising players — it
very well might be. But I don’t expect
it to last. Much of the poor defense has
been credited. to the lockout-stricken
offseason, and as time goes on I think
quarterbacks’ lives will get a lot tougher.

Hereare my five ‘quarterbacks you could
, see cool off in the near future:

_._______.___ ‘‘ ........_......_,__._._
Love him or hate
him,.we all know

that Tom Brady is a
future Hall of Famer.

---~—~—-99--:-~—---—-

Matthew Stafford, Detroit Lions

Everyone ‘knows that Stafford — the 1

first overall pick in 2009 — has enor-
mous potential, but it appears that he
might be reaching his limits this season.
He’s only 23 years old but has a 112.0
passer rating, 7 touchdowns against 2
interceptions and is averaging a robust
300 yards per game. But — and this is
a big one — he hasn’t been able to stay
healthy in either of his first~two seasons
in the league, instead acquiring two
season-ending injuries to his throwing
shoulder. If he can stay healthy, he will
have a shot to lead the 2-0 Lions tothe
playoffs for the first time since 1998. I
think he can. ’ ‘

Ryan Fitzpatrick, Buffalo Bills
Fitzpatrick and the Buffalo Bills have
‘already exceeded expectations for the

year. They’re undefeated, have the NFL’s
leading rusher and have apparently found
a superstar quarterback in Fitzpatrick.
The Harvard grad has 7 touchdowns to 1
interception, is averaging 236 yards per
game and has a quarterback rating of
109.6. I don’t expect the Bills to continue
their high level of play, but this week
will show us how good they really are +-
they’ll face off with the 2-0 New England
Patriots and their porous defense. That
also means Fitzpatrick will go head to
head with...

»

i

Tom Brady, New England Patriots

Love him or hate him, we all know
that Tom Brady is a future Hall of Famer.
That being said, through two games, his
stats are astronomical. He can’t possibly
keep up his record pace for 7,000 yards,
55 TDs and a 128.0 quarterback rating,
right?_ Right!?!

Cam Newton, Carolina Panthers _

Newton has set NFL records for yards
passing in his first two starts, averaging
427 yards per game. Granted, at times he
appears like the rookie he is -— case in
point: his four interceptions compared
to three touchdown passes —— but other
times he shows his ridiculous athletic
ability. ‘His team is winless, but as the
season goes on I expect its record will im-
prove. His stat line will suffer, but when
DeAngelo Williams picks starts running
the way he did last year,, the Panthers
will be dangerous.

Tony Romo, Dallas Cowboys

One of the most embattled players in
the country, Romo is almost never given
the benefit of the doubt. Whether it’s his
off—f1eld romances or his knack for chok-
ing in big games, Romo’s once-promising
career with the Cowboys seems to have
plateaued. But he showed a great deal of
stamina in the Cowboys’ overtime win
over San Francisco last week, finishing
the game with 345 yards passing and_
two touchdowns — all while overcom-
ing a broken" rib and punctured lung. If
he continues to play like he has so far this
season (save for the last drive against the
Jets) he just might win a playoff game. I
said “might.” ﬂ

Scott (left) will start her coaching career this year at LaSalle, where she will be dealing

Pitt after a seven-year tenure as asso-
ciate head coach last July. The coach
moved to La Salle where he became head
coach.

“I’m excited to bring Shayla into our
family, she’s the perfect fit,” Williams
said. “She helped get the program to
two Sweet 16 appearances. She has _a
phenomenal intellect of the game and
I’m excited about herjoining.”

Scott is equally excited by the op-
portunity to work with Williams.

‘fit is going to be a lot of fun work-
ing with Coach Williams,” she said.
-“He helped me to get my playing ca-

reer started at Pitt and I am extremely
appreciative of him forgiving me the
opportunity to get my college coaching
career started.”

A graduate of the local Gateway High
School, Scott was a standout at Pitt, not
just for her abilities on the court, but for
‘her on—campus involvementas well.

“Most.importantly, Shayla is a stu-
dent—athlete and the ‘type of person I

Ewant mentoring our kids,” Williams
fpsaid. “She has great character and she
leknows what it’s like-to be a student-
athlete and compete at a high level both
on the court and in the classroom.”
Scott said she is most looking for-
'ward to being on the sidelines and de-

primarily with forwards and centers.

veloping a new perspective of the game.
Her biggest fear? Navigating the city of
Philadelphia.

“I have been in Pittsburgh all_my life,
so I don’t have to worry about direc-
tions,” Scott said with a laugh. “So now

. I, pray that my GPS never lets me down,

and that no one finds out I am Steeler
fan for life.” ‘

A member of the Blue ‘and Gold So-
ciety and secretary of Pitt’s Student-
Athlete Advisory Committee, Scott
completed both her bachelor’s degree
in media and professional communica-
tions and her master’s degree in health
and fitness in the four years she spent
at Pitt. She has always found support
from her former coach at Pitt, Agnus
Berenato.

“Off the court [involvement] is some— I

thing we really stress here at the'Uni—
versity of Pittsburgh, and Shayla was a
fabulous student,” Berenato said. “She
related very well to everybody, whether
it was a fan, the chancellor, or the No. 1
Booster Donator. And I think youphave
to be adaptable to the people you are
surrounded by.” ‘
