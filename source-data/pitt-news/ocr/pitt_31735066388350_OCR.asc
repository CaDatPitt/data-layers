Con artists swindle
foreign Pitt students

By Erik Kridle  
Asst. News Editor

For the second time in a little
under three months, a foreign
Pitt graduate student is a lot poorer
because she trusted a team of con
artists who promised her money
but didn't deliver, according to
Pitt police.

“They looked like students to
me,” said the victim, who chose,
to have both her name and
nationality. remain anonymous.
“If you can’t_ trust students, who
can you trust?”

The incident, which took place
last Tuesday, resembled one last
August when a foreign Pitt
graduate student was tricked into
turning over “collateral” funds to
a team of con artists in return for
an envelope that supposedly
contained a large sum of money.‘
Last time, the victim put up $4,000
in “collateral; ” This time, however,
the “collateral” was only $335.

“These people pick on people
who are more vulnerable
perhaps because foreigners don’t

—. have a, strong grasp on our

language and.customs,” said Pitt
officer Patricia Herchenroether,
who was the responding officer
for both of the recent “theft by
deception” incidents.

According to campus police,
the victim was crossing the
Bigelow Boulevard side of the
Cathedral of Learning lawn when
she was approached by an
unidentified female who showed
the victim an envelope which she
claimed to have found on the
street. ‘

“The female actor then hailed
overanunidentified male dressed
in a doctor’s coat, who the victim
thought was just walking by,”
said police. The male, who was

an accomplice. to the female,

convinced the victim to open the
envelope. Inside was a letter
explaining that “the $53,000 in
the envelope was to be sent to
[the] addressee’s Swiss bank

account to avoid taxes.”

The male accomplice and the
victim then proceeded to the Rax
restaurant on Forbes ‘Avenue
where they were to wait for the
female who claimed she was
going downtown to speak with
the president of Mellon Bank and
ask him whether or not the three
of them could keep the money.
Later, the female returned and
said that the bank president
advised them of a 1961 President
Kennedy Law that gave finders-
keepers rights to money mislaid.

The victim, however, ‘wasn’t
convinced that she was eligible
to collect a third of the, money
because of the fact that she wasn’t
a U.S. citizen.

According to the police report,
the female then became angry.
“The female actor then placed a
call to the ‘bank president’ who
spoke to the victim. He stated
that she must produce collateral
to collect, in the amount of her
monthly rent,” which happened
to be $335. I _

“There could have been a third
individual involved; we’re not
sure,” said Herchenroether, She
reassured the victim that there
will be an ongoing investigation
into this incident.

The victim "went ahead and,
withdrew the $335 from her bank
account, giving ‘it to the female
con artist. In return the female
gave her a sealed envelope which,
she claimed, contained

money found.

Several minutes later, after the
three had parted ways, the victim
opened her envelope to ﬁnd mere
bank deposit slips where the
promised $15,000 should have
been.

The victim, who has only been
in the United States for eight
months, said that she has lost
some of the trust she once felt
toward all Americans.

“I will be more careful,” she
said.

Why would someone run 37
ﬂights of stairs to the top of the
Cathedral of Learning?

“Because I’m crazy,” said Matt
Colton, winner of the first-ever
Cathedral Climb on Sunday. "

Colton and 25 others raced
from the ground floor to the 36th
floor of the Cathedral in the
climb, sponsored by the Pitt
Program Council. Colton ran the
entire race in just four minutes
and four seconds. «i

Colton, who is on the Pitt track
team, explained his winning
strategy:

“I ran like a bat outlof hell.”

The top four runners all
completed the race within 4 1/
2 minutes." None of ‘the
contestants took more than 11
1/2 minutes. _ I '

Most runners had negative
responses immediately after the

A race.

“It was painful,” said Mike
Julian.

“I’ve never felt worse in my
life,” said Eric _Davis. J 1

However, after catching their
breath, most of the contestants
said they were glad they ran the
race and, like junior Phil Evans,
said they would do it again.

In fact, third—place ﬁnisher Mark
Jacobs ran the steps again
immediately_ after the climb.
Jacobs said he regularly runs the
Cathedral steps and has also
competed in similar races, like

’-the run to the top of the USX

Tower in downtown Pittsburgh.

Other stair—climbing races are
where PPC’s Charlie Miller got
theidea for the Cathedral Climb.
“I saw a news clipping on a race
to the top of the Empire State
Building, and when I got to be
PPC recreation chairman, I
wanted to try it here. I

“I also found out there was a
race here to the top of the U.S.
Steel building, and I was able to

go to the people who organized
it. I got my information from
them and found out how to run
it,” he said. ’

Some of the precautions taken
made for less confusion during
the climb, said Miller. For
example, the race was run in six
separate heats to avoid pushing

and crowding on the stairs,‘ he J

said. _ . , ,
Also, walkie-talykiesy were used

to coordinate the efforts of the
. race-starters on the ground floor 1

and the timekeepers on the 36th

’ floor. Other PPC workers were

stationed on various floors to
give water and make sure all
runners were progressing
smoothly. A.

Miller was happy with the race,
although he said, “I was hoping

for more people,’but this isthe .

first year.”
Since this was the first climb,

J Miller passed out surveys to the

runners to see how the race could

Black Action Society sponsors fantasy ' fashion show

A!‘

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer '

Black Week jetted to a close
with the Black Action Society’s
fashion show “flight” that took
off in a crowded William Pitt
Union Assembly Room Friday
night.

“This show is the creators’

‘*~pg=_-_r_cweption of a perfect fantasy,”

said master of ceremonies, “pilot”
George Graham to the audience
of 400. “The clothes, the music,
the scenery, the destinations, [my

A co-pilotl Tanya [Randall] and me,

Exotic G.”

Entitled “Our Fantasy,” the
show was divided into six scenes,
each representing a specific city
and fashion look.

“Fasten your safety belts and have

_a safe and_ pleasurable journey

on B.A.S. Fantasy Airlines,” said
Randall as music and the sound
of jet engines filled‘ the room,
taking the audience to the first
destination, Philadelphia.

The 31 models filed down the .

aisles onto a misty stage, lit dimly
torepresent Philadelphia at night.
The look was semi-formal with
the men dressed in dark suits and
the women wearing fiery red,

orange and white dresses and
pantsuits. _
As the individual models

strutted down the ramp to do-

their turns, the audience went
wild, screaming and calling out
the models’ names as they posed,
primped and crouched.

“The opening scene was great,”
said model Matt Twyman. “The
audience was very hyped and
stayed that way throughout the
show,” he said. ~

From the City of Brotherly Love
and semi-formal wear, the fashion
flight went to Miami A and the
casual look. ‘

The male and female models
took the stage intwo lines, with
the women standing in front of
the men. Belted slacks, both
baggy and straight cut, worn with
T-shirts were predominant among
the women. Turquoises and
purples were the major colors

‘accented by beaded and

medallion necklaces.

The men were dressed in slacks,
both pleated and plain fronted,
T-shirts and jackets of . nylon,
cotton and leather. ‘ ‘

The flightleft the beaches and
landed in an Atlanta cabaret where

formal wear was displayed. The .

men wore rented tuxedos and
the women wore their own
gowns. Moststriking was a glossy-

_ black silk tuxedo with a short

waist-length jacket.
In keeping with the formal
mood, the next event was a
presentation of a plaque by B.A.S.
chairwoman Terri Tinnin to the
-B.A.S.’s sophomore members
who showed the greatest level of
participation in this year’s Black

Week- A -A . v
“We  ‘need more active
participation from each and every
one of you,” said Tinnin. “lTo

participate] you need ‘not wear
special colors, you don’t need to
be from Philadelphia. Believe it
or not, you need not be black.
Black is not a just a color. It is a
consciousness,” she said._

Graham echoed the theme of
consciousness in his introduction
of the next scene, clubbing in
Washington, D.C.

“T 0 say that the situation [in
Washingtonlhas gotten out of
hand is an understatement,” he
said, referring to the violence
the black
neighborhoods there. “Let’s hope
D.C. comes back to life,” Graham
added.

The club scene started with a
tableau of frozen models arranged
as if in conversation at a
Washington nightclub. When the
song “Back to Life” began playing,
the models_unfroze and began
dancing; displaying button-down
shirts, baggy slacks, with and
without pleats, jeans, T —shirts,
vests and knit jackets.

“Back to Life” gave way to the
basics in a display of what Graham
called “the sexiest, slinkiest, most
seductive lingerie in» the area.”
The ﬂight landedin Los Angeles
in one vision of heaven, a steamy

red-litstage hung with silky white -

bunting.
“Whew!” was the audience
reaction as models paraded down

the ramp both conservatively
dressed in two-piece pajamas

‘and almost—dressed "in boxer

shorts, teddys and short, silky
robes.

“They loved me in the lingerie
scene,” said» model Lindsay
Maxwell. “And I loved it. It was
great. I loved every minute of it.”

The models’ enthusiasm
proved to be infectious during
the pause before the next scene.
At Graham’s invitation, six

’ members of the the audience

and stage crew got up on stage
and danced the “Electric Slide,”
to the song “My Prerogative.”
Another member of the audience,
a man named Theo from East
Liberty, got up and sang a_song.
“George, let him [Theo] back
on the mike,” said commentator
Randall as Graham started to
introduce the next scene.

“Buy the record," said Graham,
receiving laughter and a burst of
applause. Graham then
proceeded to set up the next
destination, New York City, as
“one of those places where what
you wear is what you are.”

The models took the stage
dressed in leather. Fur-collared
black leather jackets in various
lengths and styles were
predominant on models of both
sexes. Black leather pants were
also a standard.

Suede appeared in two-piece
jogging-type suits for the men
and skirts and tops for the women.
The leather wear was not only
the standard black and brown,
but also exotic purple, jade,
orange and white. '

The different colors added
excitement to a series of
choreographed sequences in
which the male models pretended
to be trying to pick up female
models on the streets of New
York. The models paired up for
the walk to the ramp and then to
the audience’s amusement,
pretended to snub each other
when it was time to take their
individual turns on the ramp.

The idea of taking a
choreographic as well as fashion
approach to the event was that of
Erica Conley, show coordinator
and choreographer.

“Since no one would be buying
the clothes, I really wanted to put
on more of a show—type show
with choreographic interaction
and scenery,” said Conley. “I’m
proud of the models,” she said,
“They worked so hard for me and

we really pulled together in the‘

end.” , I

Such unity was the theme of
the last scene, the finale landing
in'Detroit. It was prefaced by a
recording of Martin Luther King’s
“Let Freedom Ring” speech in
which he speaks of the day when
people of all creeds, colors and
religions will join hands and sing

I of their freedom together.

Each model took a ﬁnal turn
down the ramp as they were
introduced by name ‘to the
audience. Then, walking down
the aisles, all the models joined
hands and began to rock together
to the song “Lean on Me.” A

Smokers urged to qr/iitfor 01 or 3/

By Melissa Golding
Staff writer

The American Cancer Society
sponsored its 13th annual Great
American Smokeout last
Thursday, hoping to reach the
goal of helping at least one in
every five U.S. smokers to give
up cigarettes for a 24-hour period.

According to a nationwide
telephone survey done by the
Gallup Organization, 36.9 percent
of smokers, or 18.4 million
Americans, participated in 1988’s
Smokeout, and nearly 5.4 million
of those people-were able to stay
off cigarettes for 24 hours.

Held each year on the third
Thursday in November, the
Smokeout is described by the
American Cancer Society as “an
upbeat, good-natured effort to

' encourage smokers to give up

cigarettes for 24 hours."

A national program since 1977,
the event started as D—Day in
Monticello, Minn., in 1974,
created by Lynn R. Smith, editor
of the Monticello T imes. ‘Don’t
Smoke Day” spread throughout
Minnesota to California, where it
became a national movement.

' The term “Smokeout” was first

used by Arthur P. Mullaney in
1971, who asked the citizens of
Randolph, Mass., to give up their

cigarettes for a day and donate
the money they would have spent
on cigarettes to a scholarship
fund at the local high school.

Said Darlene Kerr, a volunteer
from Pittsburgh’s chapter, “It’s
free ‘information —— you can call
and get material for a friend and
help them try and get through
the day. An incredibly large
amount of people take advantage
of this day, where you get lots of
encouragement to quit. Every
year, there are people who find
they can get through 24 hours,
then try another day and decide,
‘I can quit for good.”’

Smoking remains the single
most—preventable cause of death
in our society. The Surgeon

"General states that smoking is

responsible for one out of every
six deaths in the United States.
Cigarette smoke contains 43
chemicals which have proven to

be carcinogenic. Smoking has

been implicated in cancer ofthe
lungs, mouth, pharynx, larynx,
esophagus, pancreas, uterine
cervix and bladder.

Recent studies done by the
American Dental Association
indicate thatover 29,000 people
will be diagnosed with oral

‘cancer this year alone. Using A
smokeless tobacco in place of

cigarettes, cigars or pipes will
not reduce therisk of contracting

, There’s at PS / 2 thafs
0 right for you.  

l

oral cancer.

Dr. Edward McCarthy, D.M.D.,
a dentist in private practice in
North Hills, stated, “We’re seeing
an increase in the use of smokeless
tobacco with kids. There have

i been documentations of healthy
‘young people who die of oral
cancen _

“The great fallacy comes in
[when people think], ‘I'll quit
smoking and use smokeless
tobacco. I’m not inhaling it, so I
don’t have a risk.’ I think that you
are running an equivalent risk.
The problem with quitting a
habitual use of something is that
it requires some support to be
effective. Quick cures just aren’t
any good.”.

“Quitting smoking is difficult,”
said Kerr. “Many people wonder
if they can do it. The Great
American Smokeout lets them

. know it can be done.”

People of all ages stood at the corner of South Craig and
Filmore streets waiting for Santa to parachute down into the
parking lot of the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation to begin
Light Up Night on Thursday. n

South Craig Street was illuminated with Christmas lights on
the trees and other assorted holiday decorations that blew in
the wind. The strong windthat blew these decorations was the
reason. that Santa wasnot able. to parachute to the ground.
Instead, Santa and his elf met people at the Craig Square Shops.

3 Children ﬂocked to them as they stood in the entrance of the '
square. The entrance was prepared for the holiday celebration

with Christmas trees on display and cookies for all of the “

visitors. .1

As an older man stood outside watching the festivities,
children approached Santa. “Santa, Santa, can I tell you what
I want?” they asked before getting near him.

Santa nearly lost his pants when one overly enthusiastic child
pulled on his belt, causing his red velvet pants to slide down.

Max Brallier agreed, “Well, I like him because he gives .

presents every year. I want Legos this year.” . ’

Santa and his helper have been coming to South Craig Street
as part of Light Up Night for 10_years. Santa’s visit is sponsored
by the South Craig Street Association. A ’

Betsy Schwartz, vice president of the association and owner
of Watermelon Blues, said, “We use Light Up Night each year
as a way to start the holiday season.” =

Doming the stadium

Let’s face it. Athletics plays a very important role
at the University of Pittsburgh. The truth of this
statement is readily apparent by simply ‘taking a
look at the amount of time, energy and money
spent on improving thequality, of players Pitt,
attracts and" the facilities in which they play.

The most recent idea that Pitt officials are tossing

' about is to dome Pitt Stadium. This project would

‘ take three to’ fouryears to complete and would

= cost somewhere in_ the neighborhood of 7 -$55

rnillion_.‘T he state would fund approximately’ half
the cost. . ' _ "

Concerned students may wonder where the
other half of thernoney would‘ come from, and
they have every right to question it. Never fear,
however, Pitt officials have already begun think-
ing about how to raise such a large amount, and
have approached one area industrialist, hoping to
interest him in making a large contribution in
exchange for having the new, improved stadium
named after him’. In addition, Pitt is seeking other
individual or corporate support to foot the bill of
the domed stadium. ’ * -

The renovations would include theater-style
seats, luxury boxes, a new scoreboard and a press
box.The new facility would house not only the
football team, but the basketball, baseball and
track teams as well. « . A

This would be an obvious’ benefit for all Pitt
athletics, but the real benefactor of a domed
‘stadium would be the basketball team. "Currently, ,
the Fitzgerald Field House only houses approxi-
mately. 7,000 spectators and is understandably
‘ perpetually sold out. The new facility could hold
a much larger number of fans, and thus, it stands"

_to reason that with more support from fans, the
. basketball team could do even better thanit has i
in the past. ' A. I
« Another benefit of the proposed stadium would
affect every graduating student at the University
of Pittsburgh. Currently, graduation ceremonies
are moved off-campus to the Civic Arena for lack
of available space to hold such festivities. If the
plans go through, Pitt graduates could be proudly
receiving their degrees on campusin a facility that

belongs to them. 0 ‘ h

In addition, a domed stadium would make Pitts-
burgh a candidate to host National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association tournament games. Such an
honor would bring national attention and prestige ;
to the university,not to mention more money for
the city as well. » A '

For everyone who is assuming
that the ._Cold War is over -— and

h - telling me that I’m a paranoid Cold

Warrior in the process for my insist-
ing that it isn’t —- I urge. you to
please observe the continuing de-
velopments in El Salvador.

But first let’s define the Cold War

in the terms of an individual coun— ’ —
* try: a situation in which two oppo-

nents are fighting one another for
the explicit’ purpose of Obtaining
that country’s position of leader-

ship, —with (most importantly) .one ‘_

side of democratic ideology being
financed by the United States and
the other of Marxist ideology being.
financed by the Soviet Union. Paul
Kengor, you may notbe George
Kennan, but I think that’ll do.

This type of situation was seen in
Greece, Korea, Vietnam, Afghani-
stan, parts of Africa and now El
Salvador, with Salvadoran guerrilla‘
arms shipments often being sent

“indirectly” fromthe Soviet Union to «

Cuba and delivered through the
Sandinistas of Nicaragua.

Thanks to these arms shipments, "

the marxist guerrillas in El Salvador

have been able to continue a 10- _

year civil war in that cou ntry against
their U.S.-—backed government, and
launch a major offensive in the
capital city with a total fighting force
of only 6,000 to 7,000 men, with
only 1,500 in the capital itself.

» Now before any “Kengor/Fascist” I

accusations start to fly, let me state
for the record that I’m not particu-

larly fond of the military-influenced 0.
leadership of El Salvador -whose

motto could quite arguably be, “If

. you can't beat ‘em, kill ‘em.” (Al-

though they did receive S3 percent—
of the country’s votes in the recent

elections while the guerrilla party

received,3.2 percent——even though
the guerrillas bombed the country
on election day.)

  

. But then again, if an unselfish, A

non—greedy, non-corru pt George

b Washington-type of leader with
a James Madison .ide‘o1ogy ever
peacefully emerges to rule a
Central American country, then I
personally promise to join the
American Civil Liberties Union
and subscribe to Motberjones.
Basically, the chances of a simi-
larly repressive but communist
leadership resulting in El Salva-
dor by a guerrilla overthrow
would be quite high — although
the guerrillas are losing too badly

 

for that to ever happen anyway.
What should be coming to
mind, though, is that in this
situation, without the Sandinis-

- tas of Nicaragua providing an
easy channel for arms to be
delivered to the Salvadoran
guerrillas, the guerrillas’ exis-
tence may have been otherwise
decimated by now. In this sense,

the Reagan administration is _

being vindicated in its insistence
that the Sandinista leadership
would join Castro's Cuba in at-
tempting to export Marxism
T throughout Central America —
via bloody revolutions. _
This brings to mind another
interesting situation: the fighting

that has resumed in Nicaragua .

between the Sandinistas and
Contras, with the Sandinista-
promised elections in February
possibly being canceled as op-
posing political groups gain
popularity.

S35’

  

The cold war stiil causing shivers T

As a result ofall this, Congres-
sional Democrats are no longer

trying to repudiate the Reagan

administration's claims that we.

2 should have supported the Con-

tras attempt to overthrow the
Sandinistas. However, instead of
the Democrats admittingﬁthat
Reagan may have been correct
(which would surely vindicate
the cursed Oliver North), they’re

now‘ claiming that the reason
why they didn’t support the

Contras was because they were

such a weak fighting ‘force of 

only 12,000 men. ’
This utterly ridiculous excuse

"will leave them in search of '
another utterly ridiculous excuse ,
~ as soon as an intelligent con-

gressman jump-starts the brains
of the others on the House floor

some morning by remi'nding'_ 

them that U.S.-aided Stingertgvkj
missiles allowedthe Afghanistan ‘ I
guerrillas to humiliate the‘world’s
largest military power, the Soviet V '_

Union. As a result, a small Castro
force easily overthrew the larger

Cuban leadership in 1959 and the , »

current 6,000 to 7,000 guerrillas

in" El Salvador have found,.the‘
manpower to wage war for 10,’
, years. ,

Congress cut aid to the Contras

because they didn’t want tolsee

U.S. money used to finance -a ,
civil war in Nicaragua. Yet fight-»

ing persists in Nicaragua,'_and

through Congress allowing‘ the .0 

survival of that leadership,

. a civil war in El Salvador will
continue as long as the Sandinis— .

tas (through the Cubans and

Soviets) can easily get arms to the P
Salvadoran rebels. Sounds like a ,

Cold War to me.

C im/ins 264 yards lifts Pitt to win

yards on the ground in Pitt's win over East Carolina.

I «By Chris Kuzneski

‘ Staff Writer . ,
lt’s good to have you back, Curvin.
After gaining only 109 yards over the last
month, Curvin Richards exploded for 264 yards
1 on 58 carries and propelled the Pitt Panthers to
an exciting come-from-behind win against East
Carolina on Saturday. A
Richards’ 264-yard effort places him fourth on
 _Pitt’s all-time, single-game rushinglist, just ahead

, of Craig Heyward who rushed for‘ 259 yards
5 against Kent State in 1987. The all—time Pitt mark V
 was set in 1975 by Tony Dorsett who amassed

303 yards against Notre Dame.
, Richards also managed to surpass the 2,000-
‘ yard plateau in career—rushing and moved into
- fifth place on Pitt’s all-time career listwith 2,104
yards. ’
Not bad for a day’s work.
After the game, however, the soft-spoken‘

runningback managed to allude‘ praise as easily ”

' .as would-be Pirate tacklers.
“As farjas my individual performance goes,"

i J. . said Richards, “I’d like to give that.to the offensive

 -line. It was all a team effort.” .

  The 21,862 frost-bitten fans who witnessed

Early in the game, however, it appeared like

it was going to be a long day for Richards.

On his second carry of the game, Richards was
nailed by Pirate defensive tackle Mike

Pirates’ go-ahead score. _

Tenacious offense
almost topples Pitt
in 47-42 squeaker  

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Pitt knew it was East Carolina and not East Cupcake (as the Pirates
have been called in recent years)./T he players knew it. The coaches
knew it. Everyone knew the Pirates would come out fighting and
play a 60-minute game. And yet the Panthers still almost let this one
get away before clinging on to a wild 47-42 victory Saturday.

‘‘I’m not concerned with giving up a lot of points. The only statistic
that counts is the scoreboard at the end of the game,” said Pitt
defensive tackle Marc Spindler. ,

V The 42 points are the most points that a Pitt team has surrendered
at Pitt Stadium since Oklahoma scored that many in 1984. The
Panthers have given up 111 points in their last three games, the most
since a 11S—point collapse at the end of 1972 when they went 1-10.

Several Panther defenders expressed concern, however, that the
defense gave up 390 total yards to a team that played without two
of its top four runners and a top wide receiver. A

' “We just made too many mistakes out there on defense.vWe had
some missed tackles; we blew some assignments in the secondary,
and it cost us on the scoreboard,” said cornerback Alonzo Hampton.

“[Mistakesl Came today, but luckily we played 60 minutes, and the
game was 60 minutes long because we needed every minute of it,”
said‘ Crossman, who returned an interception 67 yards for a
touchdown on the first play of the second quarter. _

The Panthers moved to 6-2-1, assuring themselves a winning
season for the third time in four years under coach Mike Gottfried
and a berth in the John Hancock bowl against the Texas A&M-
Arkansas loser. . 0

The good news is that the Panther offense returned from a month-
long vacation. Pitt’s 49 points are the most since last year against

’ . p and we won,” Richards said. v 1 . .. . j
Richards carried the ball 25 times for 188 yards in the second half

Navy, and they surpassed their total for the previous three games
combined. ' ,

The 89 combined points were the most for the Panthers since 1965
when they lost at West Virginia, 63-48, and the most total points at
home since a 96-0 victory over that ol’ Dickinson powerhouse in
1914. _ _ - . .

Butmaybe the best news of all was that Swervin’ Curvin Richards

-is back. Richards stomped and romped and ﬂew and blew by the

Pirates for 264 yards on 38 carries, a career highand the fourth best
day a Panther back ever had. Richards was on fire, literally. The
Trinidad native burned his pants while huddling close to an electric-

\— heater on the sideline trying to keep warm.

It was the fourth career 200-yard effort for the sophomore and his
first this season. Richards now has 876 yards rushing and needs 124
yards this Saturday‘ against Penn State to become only the ‘second
Panther to gain 1,000 yards rushing in two different seasons.

Richardsdoesn’t usually talk to the press, but Gottfried asked him
to say a few words on his performance, I »

“As far as my individual performance goes, I'd like to give [thanks] ‘

to the offensive line; it was a team effort. Everyone gave 100 percent,

when Pitt needed him most. A

. “I feel more comfortable at the end of the game. I get a better feel

" On the other side of the field, East Carolina's Walter Wilson has

Steelers rally behind

‘Brister and his ‘Drive’

in 20-17 home triumph

By Thomas Danylu
Staff Writer ‘

The San Francisco 49ers have
their version of “The Drive."

The Denver Broncos have their
version of “The Drive.”

Well, now ‘the Pittsburgh
Steelers, who yesterday toppled
the San Diego Chargers 20-17 at
Three Rivers Stadium, have one
of their own versions, too.

Sort of.

The only signiﬁcant difference
lies in the facts that 49ers’ “Drive”

‘ won the 1981 NFC Championship

playoff for them, and Denver’s
“Drive” practically won the 1986

AFC Championship playoff for r

them.

Pittsburgh’s “Drive” merely kept
its slim. playoff . hopes alive,
although not quite yet realistic.
It’s more like leaving the
proverbial life-support system on
for another week. '

, We’ll get to the “Drive” speciﬁcs
in a moment, but first it must be
pointed out that the Steelers’
victory was their fifth of the
season, equaling the number of
wins the team achieved in all of
1988. Pittsburgh. is now a doggie-

paddling 5-6, only two games out '

of first place in the AFC Central
division, but only a loss or two
away from the drawing known
better as “playoff elimination.”
It was early in the fourth quarter,
and the Chargers were in the lead
17-13. Pittsburgh’s offensive

output up to that point was, »

familiarly, pathetic: 117 total
yards, only 47 of those managed
by the ground attack. In the team's
last 11 quarters — going back to

_  the losses to Denver two weeks

ago and Chicago last week —
Pittsburgh’s offense had scored
only one single, . solitary
touchdown. ,

The Steelers’ pass pocket ——
a.k.a. The Land That Time. Forgot .
—- again was failing to provide

illegal block penalty on defensive
back Larry Griffin on a San Diego
punt, the Steelers had a first down
on their own 9-yard line, so things
weren’t looking much better.

“We had pretty much put the
stop to them all [during the] game
up to that point,” said Charger
defensive end Burt Grossman.
“They tried to run and we stopped
it. They tried to pass and couldn’t
do much.”

“We did an excellent job
defensively for most of the game.
They didn’t do much with the
ball,” saidsan Diego head coach
Dan Henning.

“They were doing a helluva job
stopping us,” admitted Brister.

San Diego, after starting out
the game rather sloppily, jumped
out to 7-3 lead earlyin the second
quarter on a 20-yard pass play
from Jim McMahon to Anthony

_ Miller. The Steelers bounced back

with their second field goal of the
day to make the halftime score 7-
6.

After the second—half kickoff,
the Chargers moved 61 yards and
scored on a Chris Bahr ﬁeld goal
to lead 10-6. San Diego had just
kicked off when defensive back
‘Rod Woodson decided he’d had
enough with the Steelers’ offense
and took the matter of scoring
points into his own hands. He

blew 84 yards upfield and into -
the endzone, which gave the E

Steelers a short-lived 13-10 lead.

“lspecial T earns coach] George
Stewart called a middle wedge
on the return,” explained
Woodson. “They kicked it short
to the right, so the whole left side
was open. From there on it was a
foot race  I was too tired to
dance at the end of it, though.” So
he just gave the crowd the ol’
Word-to-the-Mutha B-Boy stance
for a bit.

San- Diego ‘bolted right back
into the lead, this time on another
touchdown shot of 19-yards from

Ron Woodson (26) returned a Charger kick-off for a 84-yard touch
contest at Three Rivers Stadium. -

he did, after he said things like
that, I don’t think anyone’s going
to tell him to_ keep his mouth
shut."_‘ ,

“You can come in and [say]

‘ whatever you want, but the kid

came in and did a great job. I
think he just did what he felt he
had7 to do,” Marc Spindler said.

Pitt grabbed an early lead on
a two-play, 80-yard drive capped
by a 67-yard pass from Alex Van
Pelt to Henry T uten, the longest

” pass play for the Panthers this
A year.

East Carolina came right back,

however, needing just five plays »

for Wilson to score his first
touchdown, a 50-yard strike
from Travis Hunter. Robert
Bradley tripped on the play,
leaving'Wilson~wid_e open to tie
the score.

Carolina took a 14-7 lead.

The Panthers marched down
the ﬁeld on eightstraight running
plays to the East,Carolina.-13-

. yard line, but after an incomplete

“He was playing bump-and: '

run .- right up on the line of
scrimrnage, and he wouldn’t give
me the inside, so I took the
outside, and I think he stumbled

over his feet, and it was six -

points,” Wilson said.

Richards fumbled on the first
play of the Panthers’ next
possession, and the Pirate
offense poured-back onto the
ﬁeld. Hunter and Wilson hooked
up for a 12-yard score, and East

third down’ pass, they .were
forced to send Ed Frazier in_ for
a 31-yard ﬁeld goal attempt. 

Frazier’s kick never made it
past the line of scrimmage,
however". It was blocked by
Charles Freeman and scooped
up by Junior Robinson who
zoomed 61 yards for the
touchdown giving the Pirates a
21-7 lead with 34 seconds left in
the first quarter. .

“I have to give all the credit to
Charles. He blocked the kick; I

was just there waiting," Robinson
said.

Eric Seaman and Dave Moore
fumbled the ensuing kickoff,
and East Carolina recovered at
the Pitt 33. The quarter ended,
and the Panthers trudged off the
field amidst a sea of boos. ,

The jeers changed to cheers
on the next play, 1 however.
Crossman jumped in front of a
Hunter pass and rambled 67
yards for thescore, bringing the
Panthers to within seven.

' “I thought thatwhen we scored
first, I felt likewe had things in
control, and then all of a sudden
they came back, and the next
thing you know, we’re down
21-7, and they’re going in to

"score again, but Danny made

the key play of the game,”
Gottfried said. “It would have
been easy to fold‘ the tent, but
we didn’t do that.”

“It was a play where they
bring the guard and tackle on

both sides out and then they try
V to slip the tight end underneath.

We had a perfect call where I

i had man-to-man on the ti ghtend '

wherever he went,” Crossman
said.’ “As soon as he slipped
inside, I was already slipped
inside underneath him,‘ and

1 -[Hunter]' tried to lob it to him,

and he’ threw it right to me.” The

interception was the ﬁrstPitt has '

returned for a touchdown since
Billy Owens’ game—ending score
against Penn Statein 1987.

Neither team was able to move
the ball for the rest of the half,
and Pitt‘ headed to the locker
room down by seven._

Pitt took the ‘opening drive of
the second half down to the East
Carolina 2-yard line on five
Richards carries and a 19-yard
pass to Olanda Truitt. Adam

‘ Walker finished the drive with a

third-down ﬂip into the end
zone. The point after was no
good due to a bad snap, and the
Pirates lead remained at one.
“I’m very proud of the way
our offense responded; We
needed to respond. If we didn’t
respond, we would -have been
in deep trouble,” -said Gottfried.
Pitt’s defense held strong, on

the next drive, a 15-yard clip_
against the Pirates ‘didn’t hurt

either, and East Carolina was
forced to punt.

Six plays later, Adam Walker
was back in the end zone, this
time from four yards out. A two-
point conversion didn’t work,
and Pitt led 26-21.

East Carolina started the next
drive with a 22-yard completion
to Wilson, and ended it with a
Hunter one yard keeper into the
end zone for six. Freeman caught
a ‘pass fromr Hunter for two
more, and the Pirates led 29-26.

The lead only lasted 1:04. All
Pitt needed was 13 and 18-yard
runs from Richards and a 47-
yard pass to tight end Dave
Moore to take the lead back, 33-
29.

“I scored on a simple

deception play. I caught the

ball, had a couple of blocks and
I just went. I’ve been working
hard, and I'm glad I had a chance
today,” Moore said of his first
career touchdown.

\

The Pirates lost ﬁve yards on
their next possession and punted

_ back to the Panthers.

Richards gained 35 yards on
Pitt’s next drive, including a ﬁve-
yard stab for the touchdown
early in the fourth quarter, giving
Pitt a 40-29 lead.

“We were down 31-9 against

' West Virginia. We never give

up. We never say die,’? said
Spindler. -
But East Carolina refused. to

/.-

rs

die also. Wilson, who had only a

one reception since the first
quarter, took a 51-yard catch
down to the Pitt 8—yard line.
Two plays later, he took in a
pass from six yards out for his
third TD of the game. ECU
missed the two-pointer and Pitt
held a 40-35 lead with 9:41 left
in the game.

Pitt engineered another
scoring drive, this one behind
the running of Richards and a
34-yard pass to Truitt, before
Van Pelt scored on an eight-
yard keeper. The score was Pitt’s

fifth in ﬁve possessions in the .
second half and gave them a 47-

35 lead. V
The Pirates marched right

down the field again and, who '
else, Wilson scored on a ﬁve-4

yard reception to close the gap

to five again, 47-42. with 3:33 -

left.-. ' V . , v
1 For the first time in the secon
half, the 1 Panthers couldn’t
manage a score and were forced
to punt the ball back to ECU.
The Pirates took over ‘with
1:22 left at their own 14-yard
line. On fourth and 10 from their
own 27, Hunter called his own
number scrambling for 13 yards

_ and a first down. Two plays

later, Wilson caught a pass, faked
out Louis Riddick, and sped
down the sideline before being
pushed out of bounds at the Pitt
23 with seven seconds
remaining.

On first and 10, Hunter threw
a pass intended for Wilson in
the end zone, but Wilson turned
outside, the ball stayed inside
and fell incomplete with two
seconds, left.

“The route I, had was an
outside pattern. Travis just threw
it in the middle of the field. He
should’ve thrown it to the back
of the end zone. I don’t know if
he got pressured or what,”
Wilson said. 3
another

Hunter threw

incomplete pass for Wilson, who

was forced‘ out of bounds b
Hampton as time expired, giving
the Panthers a win and a sigh of
relief.

“I performed well, but we
didn’t come out with a win, so
I’m not happy with it,”.Wilson
said. “Every time you ‘go out and
play like that and come up losing
it hurts.’~’

' ‘This was the kind of game
that can get away ‘from you and
you can lose. ‘ There were
nu merous things that happened
that you don’t see maybe happen
in an entire season,’’_ Gottfried
said. ‘

IF‘:

The teams exchanged punts,
which brought: about the advent
of the fourth quarter, but then
Griffin got the dumb penalty.
What happened next for
Pittsburgh was simply 12 plays,
91 yards and the game—winning
touchdown. Taking it from the 9

“What got it going for us was
that square-out to Louie lLippsl,”
said Brister, who was referring to
a 19-yard completion on the right
sideline that gave the Steelers
some initial breathing room.

Then, on the very next play,
fullback Merril Hoge busted up
the middle for a gain of 31 yards,
which moved the ball to the San

-Diego 57. (“I still say [Hoge] is
their best running back,” said
Grossmarl.)

‘ Two plays later, Brister lofted a
floating pass toward tight, end
Mike Mularkey. “I have to _read
the deep coverage on that play,
and Bubby makes the short reads.
It just happened that we were on
the same page,” said Mularkey.
All alone inthe left ﬂats, Mularkey

hauled in the pass for a 22-yard
gain.

Pittsburgh pounded down to
the goal line, but in three attempts
the Chargers’ defense hung tough,
and the Steelers were denied.
Fourth down and less than a yard
was the difference between a
win and a loss.

“During the time-out, I talked it
over with [offensive coordinator]
T om Moore. We ran some people
in motion, and [San Diego’s
defensive players] were all yelling
‘Pass! Pass! Pass to [running back
Rodney] Carter.’ We just ran a
quick trap. They had been
stopping the run all day, so they
didn’t expect us to do that,” said
Brister.

Hoge plowed through a
massive hole created by the trap
for the game-winner. The defense
was left to snuff out any remaining
comeback attempts, by the
Chargers, which it did. I.

“_I told Tom it was a helluva
call,” said Brister. P

helluva drive, too.
