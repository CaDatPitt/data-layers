Speech by Nee-Nazi
The University administration, Thursday, denied resi-
dents of the fifth ﬂoor Schenly Hall permission to invite
self—styled Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell to speak as part
of the ﬂoor’s experimental lecture program.
‘_¢__ -Notice of the administration’s decision came two days
’ after ﬂoor members had voted 19-11 with two abstentions
9150 extend the invitation.
According to Shroga Stern, ﬁfth

ﬂoor resident, the idea to invite
Rockwell was precipitated by. a
previous lecturer, Lionel Roth,-
krug, a University history instruc-
tor,‘ who spoke on Fascism as a
greater danger to America than
Communism.
Members Voted

The members of the ﬂoor voted
to extendthe invitation with the
stipulations that the University
administration approve the deci-
sion, and that a_ controlled situ-
ation could be arranged in regard
to the safety of the spelker and
the students. '

Jim Seabol, ﬁfth" floor coun-
cellor, announced the adminis-
trative decision at a special ﬂoor 0
meeting after he had met with

housing, and other University

, Fraternities Vote Monday; H  
Canvass of Dorms Scheduled i I

By STAN STEIN
Student Government has completed the drafting of a

new proposal to the administration to allow alcohol on‘
campus, but before they submit the planto the University,
they will gauge student opinion through reports from frater-
nities and a door-to-door canvassing of dormitories. - in , ~,
' SG vice-president Judy Diethorn said that SG will vote

 

posal drafted by its alcohol com-
mittee only after its collects stu-
dent opinion on the issue.

If the proposal is accepted by
SG, it will be sent to Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, vice-chancellor for stu-
dent and general affairs.

Returned Plan

In— April he returned an SG
alcohol plan to SG. They had ap-
proved the plan by 17 to one,
while Interfraternity Council had
voted 16 to 12 in its favor.

“In view of the clear lack of
concensus on this. subject,” he
said at that time, “the respon-
sibility such a plan would im-
pose 7 upon a group which has
strong reservations about as-
suming‘ such, responsibility, and
the resulting opinion that the
subject is not a. pressing one,
the recommendations are re-
ferred back to the Student Gov-
ernment.” ' ‘

Tomorrow the SG Alcohol Com-
mittee will meet 'with represen-
tatives from the social fraternities
{on campus. .'1\‘h_ey -will then learn
the provisions of the new alcohol
p1an.and are expected to discuss
these with their (fraternities at
the regular meetings next Mon-
day. Each" fraternity will then
vote on the _proposal and notify
SG of the results. SG -will not
know which fraternity has made
what vote.

Dropped Class Refund

Olofson Focuses SG Attention on Senatorial
Participation and Tangible Results of Worlg
By JOSEY GROSSMAN "
Student Government established a committee to investi-
gate the policy of refunds for courses ‘dropped at its Thurs-
day night meeting. President Tom Olofson also explained to

the senators two areas for their consideration —.tangible

results of SG and senatorial participation.

The senators argued that the time limit and ﬁnancial
courseso

penalties for dropping
were “too severe.” Prior to
seven days after the course starts,
75% of the cost. returned if the
student withdraws; up to 14 days,
50% is refunded; and before 21
days after the start of the term
25% is given back.

Advisor Bernard Adams ex-

, plained that “this .control makes

it possible for the University to
make realistic plans for its pro-
gram. It would be a bit chaotic
if any student could drop a
course after the -first three or
four weeks. There must be some

. kind of check.

Properly Reviewed

“This could be properly re-
viewed by Student Government,”
he added. “There would probab-
ly be no great change, but per-
haps the time limit could be ex-
tended to four weeks or the rea-
sons for withdrawal tightened.”

In his address to the sena-
tors, Olofson explained .two
“important areas which have
changed a great deal since last
year.” The ﬁrst, tangible re-
sults, “are of great interest to
the student body. There have
been a good number of pessi-
mistic critics’ in the past from
all areas of the University and
they had a right to be. Now
there are very few who can
say" that SG has not produced
in this area.

“This organization has been in
operation for only five or six
weeks and has averaged one
major project each week. Ob-
jectively, this is an outstanding
record. Pessimism is dwindling.”

Equal Concern

The second area, interaction
and participation by the indivi-
dual senators, is ‘‘of equal con-
cern. We want to lay a firm
-foundation for future student
governments and not have to
start from scratch again. This will
happen if the senators from year
to year are participants.”

Guest Helen P. Rush, new

Dean of Students, expressed

her “keen interest in the Stu-

dent Government meetings.”
She reported that the advisors
and regular meetings with

Olofson and Judy Diethorn had
kept her informed of SG activi-
ties.

“From all that I have learned,

.1 am very proud of SG progress.

If there is any way in which I

can be helpful to the group as a

whole or‘any one of you indivi-
dually, I’ll be glad to do any-
thing within my power. This is
the most important student or-
ganization on campus. There is
no limit to what you can do,”
Miss Rush concluded.

To Lead Board

For Pitt Clgest

Robert P. Smith, a liberal
arts senior, has accepted the
chairmanship of the Pitt
Chest. Smith has been a rep-
resentative of the Religious
Fellowshipson the Pitt Chest
Board. '

The board has set the dates for
their first campaign for Novem-
ber 12 to 17. The basic organiza-
tions which will receive money
from the "drive are United Fund,
World University Service, Negro
Scholarship Fund, and the Men’s
and Women’s loan funds.

Dave Menzer, chairman of the
board, reported on a talk he had
with Bernard Carter, associate
director of development at the
University. Carter stated thathis
staff and funds would be avail-
able to the board to a limited
extent. He also suggested that
students be able to make pledges
as well as giving money outright.

Jackie Lowni gave a report on
the men’s and women's loan
funds. These funds are maintain-
ed by’ the Dean of Men’s ofﬁce
and Associated Women Students.
The funds are both maintained
by the students repaying their
loans and both need money.

WUS was explained to the

group by Reverend Paul Sch-
rading. He stated that the or-
ganization helps meet the key
problems which students face
the world over. A

The Negro Scholarship Fund
uses its money for counseling
high school students as well as
for giving scholarships to worthy
students, according to. Steve Patz.

The board now wants to get
interested students working on
the physical aspect of the cam-
paign.

2 Encores End

By JUDY ROSENTHAL
PM_ Series opened their
'trimester’s offerings Wednes-
dayevening with a lucidly
performed recital by German
pianist Detlef Kraus.
Kraus’ first selection was a

/Bach work arranged for the left‘

hand alone by Brahms and was
a fascinating visual experience as
well as a beautiful event.

Through Kraus‘_ artistry, each‘

note retained its identity while
being incorporated into one piece.
Although -he accompanied his
playing with a rhythmic nodding
of the head, Kraus’ body was
visibly relaxed, and his physical
never overshadowed
the fluid rendition of the work.
Afforded Crescendos
He afforded. the crescendos their
deserved strength with an absence
of bodily, effort. _ ~
The familiar Beethoven rondo
of “Fuer Elise” was delivered
lightly and the artists" ﬁngers
appeared to blend into the flow
of the work. Even the varia-
tions, though stronger in music-
al harmony, were softly render-i
ed. V , .
Kraus treated the piano as an

obedient child, with paternal ten-l»

derness. He was__ able to derive the-
needed, sound response with -his
handling of the instrument.
Emotional Piece

Schumann’s “Phantasie in C
Major” was the first emotional
piece of the evening. As he play-
ed the work with beautiful clar-
ity, Kraus accompanied_his hand
movements with a digniﬁed smile.

Schumann’s iusual brook-like ‘ '

sound was sensitively adhered.
to by the pianist. Deserved
strength, however, compliment-
ed the marching melody of the
ﬁnal movement. The triads were
played in, a manner enabling‘
each note’s fulltonal quality'to[
be heard.‘ ' ' 'i

Kraus also made a smooth,t'ran- -

sition from the reiterated ﬁrmness
of 'the,fourth' movement to the
softly lilting theme of the last
movement.
_ Not Involved
Although the pianist afforded
full emotionalism to Schumann’s
work, he never allowed himself to
become so involved in a portion
such that he was unableto incon-
spicuously progress into the fol-
lowing movement. .
After a powerfully rendered

Kraus played a- short ,Brahms
piece, “Variations on a Hungar-
ian Song, Opus 2, No. 2” The
; theme had the familiar Brahms’
repetition of melodic line which
the artist neatly embroidered
into the material embodied in
the entire work. A

once more wtih a softness of note

 

 
   

 

  German Pianist Kraus Performs

 

BACK OF ARTIST shows to photographer as Detlef Kraus enter-
tains audience at last week’s PM ‘program. Works by Bach, Beet-
hoven, Schumann, Bartok, Debussy, and Brahms composed his re-
petoire. Audience reaction prompted two encores from the German

combinations and the pianist ap-
peared to work with the composer
to achieve a beautifully uniﬁed
effect.

Diversiﬁed Program
DebLissy’s impressionistic’ “Im-
ages” and “L’Isle Joyeuse” were
played to complete Mr. Kraus’ di-
versiﬁed program. These two
works were typical of the com-

come to the Coliseum. Better still, buy ’em by the carton.” _

posers musical commentaries on
rusticity and the pianist’s some-
times powerful ﬁngers complied
with the gentleness desired in
parts of Debussy’s compositions.

The composer’s integrated dis-_
sonance modiﬁed by thematic
consistency was rendered with
the artist’s usual light but won-
derful clarity of touch. ’

After a , well-deserved ovation
by the Supper Room audience, the-
pianist played two welcome en-
cores. The rendition of a Brahms
work epitomized Kraus’ expres-
sive but delicate handling of mu-
sical composition, while the art-
ist’s second choice, a Schubert
piece, exploited his ability to uni-
fy themes-‘characterized by trills.

Dpportunit y K noclrs

Keeping another promise which is had revealed at

’ the beginning of the trimester, Student Government recent-

ly announced plans to promote the establishment of alcohol
on campus if the student body appears to be substantially

.in favor of the idea.

Creating a means of changing the University into a
wet campus has been a controversial subject for a good
part of the year. The original proposal for the legalization
of alcohol was sorely battered about from student organi-
zation to administration to student organization and back
again for several weeks in the preceding terms. It was ﬁnal-
ly agreed that, among other things, the old proposal was

- inadequate to cope with the "revolutionary nature of the

idea behind it because it apparently did not contain any
evidence that the troublesome proposal did, in fact, have
the support of the student body which Student Govern-
ment was supposedly representing. - _
Today’s Student Government, seemingly in better
working order than it has been in the past several years,"
has decided to meet the hard drink question head on with
the only logical course of action; that is, it is taking the
proposal to the students before it takes any furthersteps.
According to Student Government vice-president Judy
Diethorn, dormitory students will be asked their opinion in
a door-to-door pool one week from tonight, between the
hours of 6 and 9 p.m. Unfortunately, no arrangements have
been made for a systematized polling of commuting stu-

dents.

Students lucky enough to be included in the canvassing
have an unusual opportunity to play an active role concern-
ing a proposal which mayradically affect the future and
the public image of the "University. ‘It is felt that students
favoring the issue will not miss the chance to express their
view, but by the same token, many students have not_decid-
ed for themselves yet or, more important, many are not
particularly in favor of the proposal but may feel that they
are infringing on the desires of the ones in favor if they
vote negatively. I

The alcohol proposal will be released for public atten-
tion this week and will be published in Wednesday’s edition
of The Pitt News. It is hoped that all of the students who
will be asked for their opinion on the subject — drinkers

‘and non-drinkers alike — will study the proposal careful-

ly, formulate their own stand, and contribute it when the
rare opportunity to express it comes knocking next Monday

National Review Reviewed . . .

The Buckley  Brigade   

By Jim Kleinberg

I have just spent a few moments reading the
October 9 ‘issue of the National Review (A Journal
of Fact and Opinion). For those of you unfamil-
iarvwith this publication, it is edited by a Yale
graduate of considerable means,
William Buckley, Jr., and edi-—
torially supports the “conserva—
tive” side of American politics. "

In this issue Mr. Buckley '
states in regard to the relation-
ship between James Meredith
and Nikita Khrushchev, “Mr.
Meredith wantsthat campus and
Mr. Khrushchev wants the West-
ern Hemisphere.” Further, Gov-
ernor Ross Barnett was defend-
ingan “honorable principle, the
principle "of home rule” in ﬁghting Meredith’s ad-
mission to Ole’ Miss. Mr. Buckley conﬁdes _to us
that as bad a student of the constitution as Barnett
might be, he is still not as -bad as Earl Warren.

The editor of the National Review concludes by
stating how much better it. would be for‘ Meredith
himself if he went to a Negro college.“ In his words,
“. . . is he (Meredith) going to be happier or better
off, at the University of Mississippi, where "he is
not wanted . . .?” In the same vein we" might ask
Mr. Buckley, “Wouldn’t it be better and happier
for all concerned if we just forget about’ Article
VI, Section'II', and Article 14, Section 1 of the
United States Constitution?

Kennedy ‘I-o Control Industry

Next-onward and upward to economics. This
complex subject has been examined by the cold
light of conservative reason, and ithas been dis-
covered that the Trade Bill that recently passed
Congress, has on page’ 256 of NR given Kennedy
“the power to control U.S. "Industry now.”

Are the editors of the National Review taking
all _of this “Fact and Opinion” seriously? Yes, in-
deed, and it is for this very reason that their
plight is even more lamentable. Oh, these patriots
know theiripolicies, -and they buttress them with
clever sarcasm (Mr. Buckley’s specialty), but they
do not have any real plans for actual participation
in governmentlf they did, they would join a

 

Hour of Decision . . .

political party (although the odds of them ﬁnding
a suitable one are terribly high) or form a new
party of their own.

For as any schoolchild knows, our government

‘ runs on the basis of representation ‘of views ‘trans-

formed, through law, into policies. It is strange to

, examine the various groups of the “conservative”

realm who ‘study and discuss, yet never act. What

are they studying for? There is a mystique abg‘ut" 

them, an aura of the coming Judgment Day, when
New Dealers, Fair Dealers, New Frontiermen, and
treacherous pseudo-Republicans ‘(Rockefeller and

Javits of New York) will be burned at the‘ stake. .

Democrats needn't fear a sudden revolt against
them. After all, the total circulation per issue of
the National Review is only around 50,000. The
real thing to fear is the frustration and aggression
built up in these noble “conservatives.” To find
yourself rebuffed, even by members of your own

social class, to be constantly opposed by a ma’-: 

jority, to .ﬁnd it next to impossible‘ to transfer
concepts into real policies — this is real frustration.

Surely even Mr. Buckley must experience this
frustration. If he hasn’t, I’m sure James Meredith
and thousands of other Negroes could supply him
with the necessary training. Such frustration breeds
discontent “first, then sarcasm, then, bitterness, t-hen
hate. - . ‘

It is the very nature ofthis bitterness and sar-
casm whichalienate most of these “conservatives”

from what I would call the true conservative? 

“Every truly civilized and enlightened man is
conservative and liberal and progressive. A con-
servative man is . . . the indefatigible defender
of our own constitutional doctrine, which isithat
all power, that all government, that‘ all oﬁcials,
that all parties, and all majorities are under the
law — and that none of them is sovereign and
omnipotent. .

“The Civilized manis liberal because the writ-
ing and [administration of the laws should be done

with enlightenment and compassion, with tolerance_—;
and charity . . . And the civilized man is progres- J‘

sive because the times chance . . . and new things
are inyented and changes occur.” -— That was
written by Walter Lippmann in January, 1962.

 LETTERS TO THEEDITOR

‘Spirited’
Drama Critic Attacked

I
l Editor, The Pitt News
l Once again The Pitt News has
} come through for the student
| body here at Pitt; this time with
l the enlightening wit of Miss
’ fusanna Downie, your benevo-
ent Drama Critic. We have seen
your spirited columnists in ac-
tion before. I’m sure that Pitt’s
I athletes and fraternity people
must love you very much, not to
mention the University Theatre.
As, a member of the Newspa-
per Chorus of Professor Lee’s
dramatic poem, “An American
"* as Faust”, I have learned just
 how vicious an agent of the
l _ }'press can be. Perhaps Miss Dow-
J me was upset because she
couldn’t be the ninth_member of
that villainous and crude news-
~ paper chorus. Here I agree, Mr.
Engle, the director missed a
golden opportunity; Miss Downie
was typecast for the role! Can-
not Miss Downie, for all her
abusive wit, understand that the
characters in this poem were
Univers_al_s and not Individuals‘?
yjr‘§}r is she just too busy piling
on the sarcasm to read the pro-
gram where it is clearly printed‘?
Congratulations Pitt News!
You never fail to show your

totally ignorant your writers

can be. Keep up the good work!

//{Downie Critized”
- ‘f For Phraseology

Editor, The Pitt News
Miss Downie’s “Review of ’An
American as Faust’ ” employed
many of the generalities and
, much of the wordiness» that she
:_, foundhso offensive in Professor
j Lee’s "vvork. V
,3; Though I enjoyed the produc-
A cation very much, I would cer-
'-‘tainly have understood her opin-
ion if'she had substantiated her
, argument. Avoiding speciﬁc de-
fl tails, however, Miss Downie was
able to make a farce of the
whole poem through her'own
clever phraseology.
She managed to make “mod-
ern French music” almost. naus-
eating by describing it ‘with the

readers just how crude, vile and ,

first three paragraphs to des-
cribe‘ the ailments she contracted
as a result of theplay. Here
she employed so much concrete
detail and ponderous vocabu-
lary that one expected a valu-
able critique.

It seems, however, that after
stating that “You just _can’t keep
generalizing all the time,” Miss

, Downie‘ got caught herself in the

trap of’ the glittering generality
and never quite succeeded in ex-
tricating herself. It is doubtless
that many of the statements
were written for nothing but ef-
fect.

Anyone who saw the play
would have no difficulty in iden-
tifying the newspapermen whom
our reporter termed “a chorus
of frogs or harpies or some-
thing.” Intent upon making a
point, Miss "Downie even re-
fused to give credit for the tech-
nical smoothness of the produc-
tion. and her praise was de-
livered in-the best satirical style.

It is unfortunate that this
pseudo-sophisticated review has
influenced the opinion of most of
the student body. As there were
probably no more than 30 Pitt

students at the production ‘dur-_

ing its three-night run, Miss

Downie’s statements have been‘

accepted as dogma by all~ but
a few.

_ It took more than one read-
ing for me to realize that she
had used many words and said

_very’ little even though I had

seen the play. I imagine that the
average student read it once and
said “nerd” ‘o “Lawrence Sock-
it—to-em Lee”. Isn’t the power
of the press a wonderful thing?

Student Assails
SG's ‘Old Miss’ Stand

Editor, The Pitt News

I was shocked to read (Pitt
News, October 3) that Student
Government decided not to send
a letter to the University of
Mississippi- stating disapproval
of the student rioting at Oxford
for the reason that SG
not understand all facts of the
situation.” i 4

Perhaps SG cannot under-
stand "all facts of the situation,
but certainly at least three mas-
sive issues must be clear cut even
to our'student senators: ‘student
participation in rioting meant to
circumvent court orders, admit-
sion of a Negro to a public uni-
versity,.and federal versus state
authority. Why coL1ldn’t SG take
a stand on the‘ obvious issues
and leave the “facets” to others‘?

Bible Seen As More
Than ‘Just Poetry’ .

‘Editor, The Pitt News

Stan Stein’s “Churches and
Chips” (October 3, page 4) im-

presses me by the cleverness of"

his writing. Several of his points
are ‘so true they hurt, although
he is hardly "the ﬁrst to have
noticed them.

At one point, however, I must-

take exception. He says the Bi-
ble is “just poetry,” not “meant

'to be taken literally." Now the

Bible is a long and quite diverse
volume-and there is a great deal
of poetry and imagery in it.
Much of this was likely not
“meant to be taken literally.”
Yet to classify it all aspoetry,

'.would, I. am sure, startle such

eminent ' biblical scientists as
Nelson Glueck and W. F. Al-
bright who have given their

“could *

lives to documenting historical
allusions in the Scriptures.

But what is more disturbing
is the seeming assumption that
not to be taken literally" means
not to be taken seriously. ‘Per-
haps, though, I am stirred up
without sufficient reason. For I
partly suspect‘ that “Churches
and Chips” is intended as poetry
or at least not “meant to be
taken literally.”

Except possibly the last four
or ﬁve paragraphs.

Harrison Letter

Knocked‘ by Graduate

Editor, The Pitt News
After reading the letter of

I October 8, by. Mr. Harrison, con-

cerning the iMeredith Misnomer,
I can more readily understand
why de-segregation is so pain-
ful. There seems to‘ be a pre-
vailing air of empathetic ignor-
ance, even in the North, as to
what characterizes the strivings
of our Federal Government in
their attempts to remedy the
non-conformings of one of the
three remaining stagnating
dark-aged “totalitarian poli_ced
states” of the South.

If Mr. Harrison feelsthat pro-
gress has been ‘too much has-
tened, perhaps he‘ would prefer
to be living prior to the Civil
War. If the wishes to make com-
parisons, let him draw them
from a comparable frame-of-
reference. If he is fearful of the
deprivation of right, let him
more closely examine the docu-
ments from which our rights
were secured. a

The practice of democracy
does not come always with lace-
cuffed and poetical declarations.
Sometimes there must be a sup-
plementation of physical persua-
sion. i

When Americans are ready to
meet each other face-to-face and
allow human dignity and indivi-

dual worth to preserve no long-

er will there be room for our
clannish southern a-ntagonizers,

.neither will they be long re-

membered. _

agreed that these “outstanding” new additions will help to

Accord'ing to Marshall Robinson, dean of the School of

Business, the addition of facu1ty¢
reflects the shift of business from

Dean Joseph A. Bianculli com-
mented that additional faculty
have been engaged for both the

a National Instotute of . Health
grant. This department, whose
purpose. is to _evalua_te methods
used in studyingdrugs that affect
behavior, is the first in the United
States to be established in con-
nection with a pharmacy school.

“Because the number of grad-
uate engineering students has
been steadily increasing, these

to maintain hi g h department

Three additions in the Graduate

‘The University, commented Dr.
7;‘'Donald Tritschler, has an unusual
“ and extensive collection of rec-
ords which will someday be price-
less. Dr. Donald Tritschler, an as-
sistant professor of English, spoke
at the monthly Stark Record
E’ Hour last- Thursday in the Alld- ~ ' ~-
 .red Room, 609 CL.

He played recordings of Eng-
' lish and American poets reading
their own work. Tritschler ex-

plained that the sounds and
meanings of poetry come out

very well when it is heard and
 that an author reading his own
» ' work can make poetry even more
 signiﬁcant.

Selections heard on Thursday
f afternoon were William Yeats
.’-_“Coole and Ba1]ylee”; Geron-
7'_.tion by T. S. Elliot; and Dylan
Thomas reading a humorous se-
lection of Reeds and two of his
own poems, “Lament" and “Fern
Hill.”

In order to show the difference
,-in the reading technique between
a professional and the author, Dr.
Tritschler then played “Fern
Hill” as read by Richard Burton.
This was followed by more of
Thomas, “The Vill-.melle”; and
Robert Frost's, “Birches.”

The concluding recording was a
favorite of '1‘ritsehler’s: James
"Joyce reading from his book,
Finnegans Wake.

‘Dr. Vogt Tells
Of ‘Explosion’

_ By ROSITA WHITMAN

According to Dr. William
Vogt, in his Midday Series
lecture on “Population is
Everybody’s Business”, few
people talk about population,
but everybody does some-
thing about it. o ' ‘

The former national director
and executive vice president of
the Planned Parenthood Federa-
tion commented that people are
more aware of the problem but
that it still does not compete with
any other modern topics.

“The sudden rise in population
is the most violent revolution’
man has to face,” said Vogt. He
noted that since primitive time,
man has not had to confront
changes in his environment so
meaningful to his future.

Three Billion

Vogt pointed out ‘that it took
from the beginning of habitation
to 1830 to reach the ﬁrst billion
of population, and from 1830 un-
til 1940 the second billion and by
-1960 the third billion. The fourth

billion’ will be reached each dec-
ade until the turn ofthe century.
“Our ethics must be’ re—examined
because we are living in a new
society,” declared Vogt.

“In the United. States,,'Presi-_
dent Washington presided over
four million citizens, President’
Kennedy presides over 186 mil-
lion, one of Caroline Kennedy’s
generation will preside over
350 million, and her grandchild
will-——preside over one billion
citizens.” - ‘ —

“In 1940 dependents (persons
under 90 and over 65)-comprised-
41% of the population, but by
1980, according to a conservative
estimate "of the Bureau of Census,
51% of the population will be
cared fyorby the productive mem-
hers-of society,” stated Vogt. .

“The fact‘ that state expendi-
tures rise a billion dollars per
year and college admissions will
increase by 60% advances the
problem '3 ﬁnd funds to educate
these people and ﬁnd them good
teachers. Although 15 more
million people are in colleges
today, only 104 doctors graduate
from,our Medical Schools. This
is our major problem, our un-
derstaffed~and overcrowded hos-
pitals,” aﬁirmed Vogt.

He emphasized that there is not

a single religious group that op-.

poses population control as long
as performed under the tenets of
the Church. He also declared that
he categorically opposed compul-
sory control of family size.

 

SPECTACLES SHIFTED, Midday speaker
pares to continue his lecture on the sudden rise in population. The
executive ’vice president of the Planned. Parenthood Federation
called the trend, a “meaningful” change in environment for man.

Finals Week Runs

members will be canvassing cam-
pus. dormitories door to door,
polling students on their opinions
of the alcohol proposal. The pro-
posal will be published in Wed-
nesday’s issue of The Pitt News

“This is a very important
issue,” Miss Diethorn said. It’s

important to the entire campus.
' This is the opportunity for stu-
dents to express their opinions,
so I hope they will take advan-
tage of it.”. ’ F
She urged dormitory students to
be in their own rooms between
6 p.m.-and 9 p.m. to facilitate the
polling procedure. .

Fantasy Shows Evil,
Suggests An Antidote

By BARRY (moss

f. Something Wicked. This Way Comes (Doubleday, $4.95,
317 pp.) is Ray Bradbury’s ﬁrst novel-length excursion into

He throws in all the elements that‘have gained him pop-
.‘..,ularity.: fresh and vivid imagery, nostalgia over boyhood
days in small towns during October, and an ability to put into

   
   
  
   
 
   
 
 
   
 
  
   
  
  
 
   
   
  
   
    
  
   
   

ror connected with the shadowy!
evils so distinct in childhood and
so vague in adulthood. -
‘ Bradbury describes the ﬁght of
_a ‘man and two boys «against a
carnival that stimulates fears and
.hatreds in men and then feeds on
,_ the resulting evil. He has created
"a, fantasy where plot is controlled,
but where tone‘ is uneven.
, ‘ . _ Basic Moods
.~'I,‘wo basic moods run through
the novel. There is the joy in
boyhood that-Jim Nightshade and
William Halloway feel.
Countering this happy mood
of wonder there is a somber and ‘
malevolent undercurrent of hor-
roiﬁwhich emanates from the
-carnival and its tormented in-

habitants. _ '
The trouble is tha. the author,
jfwith his great ingenuity
fzfreshness of style, hits the reader
gwith so many new and clever
».metaphores and word usages that
the book’s moods at times seem
confused and jumbled. Or maybe
it's just too much of a good thing
jading the senses.
. Intriguing Story
-In spite of this, the story is in-
triguing and fast reading. All of
"our basic and superstitious fears
- are clearly expressed, personiﬁed
in the form of the carnival’s
_.,-'ﬁendish inhabitants and horrible
"devices.

» Jim Nightinshade and Will

“words the deepest feelings of hor-5

 I-lalloway, along with Will's

 

father, recognize the overpow-
ering evil which the carnival
has brought to their town. In
their desperate fight they util-
ize all those charact'eristics of
humanity which Bradbury be-
lieves are ennobling in man.

Siiperfically, a scene where a
malligniant Illustrated Man and a
dust witch are chasing two boys
and a janitor through the dark
and dusty shelves of a library
would seem laughable to the so-
phisticated reader. But so skill-
fully has Bradbury built a feel-
ing of horror that suspensedoes
exist.

It is fantasy put to good use:
an exposition of lingering super-
stitions and fears, an exploration
of the nature of wickedness, and
a suggestion of its antidote.

upon University administrators
by “outside powers.”

Reactions to both the decision
to invite Rockwell and the de-
nial of permission were varied
among the ﬂoor’s residents. Jeff
l_-Iirsch, senior in the school of
Liberal Arts, commented, “I don’t
see any academic purpose which
would be fulﬁlled by having him.
They’re calling him in ‘because
he’s a freak.”

Against Approvel
Curt Roemele, Schenley Hall
Head Resident, stated that he was
against approval of the ﬂoor’s de-
cision, because he didn’t think it
could be a controlable situation.

Tom Smith, Arts sophomore,
on the other hand, said, “it
would have served a. good pur-
pose—perhaps an academic pur-
pose. I was interested in see-
ing somebody with those ideas
—-to see his delivery. The peo-
ple who were against it 'were
very emotional.” ’

In discussing the fairness of the
decision, Steve Ryack, Arts Soph-
omore, who voted against the in-
vitation said, “The Univer‘si"€Y’S
decision can be used as a prece-
dent against inviting other con-
troversial persons to the campus.”
He added, however, that he could
“understand the University’s po-

sition as far as the‘impaet that
George Lincoln Rockwell would
have on the city.”
Abstainer Speaks

As to whether the members of
the ﬂoor felt any disappointment
or resentment over the decision,
Mike Kalisher, Liberal Arts fresh-
man who abtsained from the vote,
said, “We accept what the ad-
ministration did, because we un-
derstand that they had the right
to do it."

“We’re quite satisﬁed,” said
Mike Marcus, also an . .Arts
freshman, and John- Seidmam
agreed: “I am personally sat-
isﬁed that we anticipated the
posibility of this decision.”

This is the second time that the
idea of inviting Rockwell to the
University community i has been
broached. Last March, the Stu-
dent Union Board vetoed the pos-
sibility of his speaking at a Mid-
day Series presentation.

For Kent State

After the .Cubs seige of
“fumblitis” against a surpris-
ing‘ Navy Plebe squad, Coach
Kaliden has his forces run-

through extensive drills
this week in preparation for Sat-
urday’s tilt with Kent State.

Kaliden seemed impressed .witFi'
individuals more than with the
team as a whole after the Navy
loss. He liked Kenny Lucas and
Eric Crabtree on the offensive at-
tack, but added that play could
be a lot sharper.

It will be the defensive ‘unit
that will receive the bulk or
attention before this weekend’s
game. Kaliden noted a very evi-
dent lack of aggressiveness
against the Plebes,'a hardship
that must be overcome if the
Cubs are to equal last season’s
2-2 record.

loss, the fresh suffered still an-
other blow at Annapolis. Tackle

Varsity and reshman Basketball

Players To Begin Practice Today

The Panther basketball team
will officially begin practice to-
day for the 1962-1963 season. To-
day is the opening of basketball
practice for all teams that are
members of the National Colle-
giate Athletic Association.

Coach Bob Timmons has asked
that all interested boys report to
the Field House at 3 p.m. Fresh-
man ball players should report
to the Stadium Gym at the same

time. Coach Carl Peterson has
only two scholarship holders and
there are about 12 openings on
the squad.

Coach Timmons has said that
this season there will also be a
junior varsity squad composed of
about 10 or 12 boys. Both the JV

and freshman teams will play
eight-game schedules.
The varsity will have six

weeks to, prepare for its opener
with Purdue.

Two More Fraternities Eliminated

 

By IVIARVIN ZELKOVVITZ

Pi Lambda Phi and Phi Epsilon Pi remained tied for
first place in the intramural softball league as they split the
two games they have played against each other. Phi Ep won
the first game, 11-6, and PiLam rallied in the second game,

9-6.

Pi Lam led 3-2 going into the third inning of the ﬁrst

game. But an eight-run third .inn—¢
' ing by the Phi Eps was more than‘

enough to reverse the tables. Phi
Ep scored the runs on nine hits
as 11 consecutive men got on base.

Bob Moses, Pi Lam shortstop,
who went into the game batting
.750, was ,held to a single in three
trips to the plate.

Pi Lams Rally

In the second game, played last
Wednesday, Phi Ep’s inability to.
score resulted in a‘ Pi Lam vic-
tory.

The score‘ was tied at 5-5 at the
end of the first ‘two innings with
both teams taking ‘ advantage of

. errors.

Phi Ep ha‘d”the bases loaded
in the ﬁfth with one out, and
had menon second and third in
the Sixth inning with one out.
-But they failed to score: both
times. .0 ‘ .

Pi Lam broke a 6-6 deadlock
in the sixth inning. Steve Munter
let Rich Laskey’s ground ball go
through his legs to allow the sev-
enth and eighth runs to score.

The score of the final game was
not known at press time.

runs, »

Pi Lam, still shell-shocked by
their pastingifrom Phi Ep, eaked
out an _8—7 victory over Sigma
Chi.

In the‘ first inning, Sigma Chi
got oil? to _a fast start by scoring
fourruns on ﬁve hits, including

doubles by Bob Hunter and‘ Jay

Opposition

before it reaches its destinatio_n.O

The lanky .Staab was originally
recruited for the squash team
from University physical educa-
tion classes. But soccer Coach Leo
Bemis chanced to see him inac-
tion on the squash court and was
impressed with the way Staab
made his moves._ He asked the
goalie-to-be to go out for the
team.

Developed Skill

Staab was already a sophomore,
so he was introduced to the
goalie’s position, where he could
“develop his skills more quickly
than he could have at other posi-
tions.” I —

This trimester, Staab is a
junior, majoring in accounting
in the School of Business Ad-

Front linemen and backﬁelders on other soccer squads
have tried blasting, bombing, driving

_part that the agile Panther goalie will not yield.

Although Staab has made sev-
eral important stops himself, last
week preventing an Akron score
at a crucial moment when he 3
made a hand save on a sure goal,
he gives real credit for "a more
than adequate defense to his full—~ ';
backs. ‘ » I ' .
‘The modest Staab rates Howard
and West Chester as the toughest
teams he has faced and regards
them as the‘ toughest opposition
he will face this season. The 
goalies is looking forward to, an"
NCAA bid for the Panthers, and
he feels that “if the team ‘can
keep‘the same spirit, we can-Ago’
