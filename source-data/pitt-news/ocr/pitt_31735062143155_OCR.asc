To Gr idders

Dear Boys:

I am. leaving the ~Universit_y_of
Pittsburgh to accept the .p0S1tl0I1
of coach of football at Ohio State,
my Alma Mater, with something
very important unﬁnished, some-
thing that I wanted above all else
to do. However, circumstances
make this impossible.

I wanted to call all of you to-

gether and say goodbye personal-

ly. I wanted to explain to you,
who have been so grand to me,
why I was leaving, and to tell
you all, once again, my true feel-
ings for you. ‘ ,

.You and I have had a lot of
hard battles to ﬁght this past fall,
some high obstacles to surmount.
That we neither won all the ﬁghts,
nor overcame all the obstacles
doesn’t matter now. It does mat-
ter that you went all out, that we
made some progress, and that we
made the future look pretty bright.
That future is still bright;‘you
are on your way. I know that.

I want to thank all of you for
your loyalty, for your courage,
your enthusiasm, and all the many
fine qualities that you carried in-
to games. I have never been so
proud of a group of fellows, and
I am leaving Pittsburgh with a
mighty warm feeling in my heart
for all of you. The way you put
out in practice and in the games
made a lot of Saturday afternoons
much shorter than they might have
been. .

I want to .,wish' each and every
one of you all possible success
during your stay at Pitt, and af-
terwards. I count myself very for-
tunate to have been with you this
past Year. “

Regards,
‘ WES.

Saalbach Announces Soph Hop
Net‘ Profit Exceeds $350

A proﬁt of “$350 or more”

‘closed the ﬁnancial records of the

Soph Hop. first of Pitts “big four”
social events of the year. William
F. Saalbach. assistant t.o the dean
of men, announced last week.
“The $350 or more profit from
this dance ultimately will reach
the University social events re-
serve accounl. a fund set up to
cushion losses or absorb proﬁts
from the Freshman Dance, Soph
Hop. Junior Prom, and the Spring
Festival.” stated Mr. Saalbach.
In explaining the excessive re-
turns from‘ the sophomore dance,

1‘./Ir. Saalbach said, “Ordinarily, a
proﬁt of this size means that the
admission fee was ‘too high, or that
the students did not get what they
expected in the way of music and
entertainment. However. the stu-
dents seemed satisﬁed with the
dance. *

“Good judgment on the part of
the dance committee, and indicated
student interest in soc-ial affairs
seem to be the reasons.”

The overall social events re-
serve fund. a product of the war,
was set up by the University to
replace the original class funds.

In the past, the University placed
an account in the hands of each
graduating class to encompass loss-
es and gains throughout its four
year course.

Under the present plan, the pro-
ﬁt realized by the Soph Hop will
remain in that account until the
end of the 1946-47 school year.
At that time, it will be transferred
to the social events reserve fund.

According to Mr. Saalbach. “it
is not the aim of the University
to make a proﬁt on its dances, nor
is it policy to lose money on
them.”

came after official action of, the
University following Wes Fesler’s
formal resignation last Friday.
Hagan Gets His Man

In spite of the previous impli-
cation by James Hagan, athletic
director, that several weeks might
be required for the recommenda-
tions to go through ofﬁcial chan-
nels,- the announcement came a
scant three days after Fes1er’s de-
parture for Columbus.

When Chancellor Fitzgerald
announced the appoi; tment
of “Mike” Milligan to head
football coach, he issuer‘. the ‘
following statement: “I am
pleased we have a max on
our coaching staff who has
won the united support of the
University of the gommunity
for the position of head foot-
ball coach. Mr. Milligan is a
top-ﬂight coach and a ﬁne in-
ﬂuence on young men.”

Director Hagan and the Faculty
Committee on Athletics, headed
by Dr. R. E. Sherrill, found a can-
didate for the vacant post “right
in the next ofﬁce.”- Milligan has
spent nine years of his eighteen-
year football career at Pitt.

» Varsity Gridder in ’30s

Mike played varsity football at
Pittifrom 1929 to‘ 1931 and re-
turned to Pitt in 1934 as freshman
coach under Jock Sutherland. In
the 1938 football shake-up, Mike
resigned and took at job as assist-
ant coach at the University ‘of
Florida, remaining there until

1941 when ‘he moved to Tulsa’

university as line coach under

Henry Frnka. The Frnka-Milli-I

gan combination led the Tulsans

to five New Year’s Day bowl

games'in ﬁve years. —
When Frnka left Tulsa, Milli-

gan came back to Pitt as Fesler’s
line Coach, and, after one season
here, is fully prepared to take
the reins as head coach.

Cyclotron on View

Third largest in the world, the
cyclotron is believed by Dr. Alex-
ander J. Allen, Westinghouse
Graduate Professor‘ of ‘Engineer-

tron, to be the most efficient and
productive for general research
purposes in existence.

Duringthe course of last semester, the Pitt News along
with several students organizations on campus, vigorously at-
tacked the Ofﬁce of the Registrar for the ﬁasco atSeptember
registration. ' - .

It has been our opinion that that office was immovable and
that any barbs and comments of student groups would be
graciously received and, as graciously, thrown into the waste-
.basket. The recent February has proved that we were in error.

The new plan for registration installed by Dr. Quick and Mr.
Batchelder, evolved into a. scheme far and above any original
claims of its workability.

For the ﬁrst, time in the history of Pitt, students"Were reg-
istered within an hour of the time that they entered the
Mosque. A . .

It seems that the efﬁcient methods of the registrar are
catching, The organizationiset uppby Mr. Biddle and his staff
to accommodate some 8,000 veterans was nothing short of mir-
aculous. Timing for the entire form—ﬁlling ordeal averaged a
mere 45 minutes, contrasted to two hours in September.

The bookstore enteredpthe swing of things last week by
cutting the -time required to obtain texts and notebooks to,
in ‘most cases, a half hour. A ‘

that students are still wondering what hit them. The average
time for registration—complete to ﬁnding your way out of, the
maze of pipes in the bookstore——amounted to a little more than
two hours. This contrasts with almost ﬁve hours in September.

Will Be Replaced

by John Patterson

The Corps of Engineers has been
directed to develop plans and spe-
ciﬁcations for a 1248 bed Veterans
hospital within the grounds of the
University of Pittsburgh. In a te-
letype press release from Phila-
delphia, the Veterans ‘Administra-
tion announced that the 14-acre
site is “on high‘ ground directly
north of the football stadium.”

John Weber, secretary of the
University, stated that he had re-
ceived no official notiﬁcation as
yet. “We expect to hear within
the near future,” he said, “and
shall haveat least a— year after
this ofﬁcialnotiﬁcation to abandon
any University buildings located
there.”

Trees gymnasium, the School of
Mines laboratory, and Pitt’s de-
crepit track house are on the pro-
posed site. “We are working on
plans now to house University ac-
tivities in the area elsewhere,”
commented,Dr. Weber, “but they
are not developed enough" to an-
nounce at this time.” v

Pitt appliedfor six government-
supplied buildings‘, last month. If
they are secured, four of these
will be used for the School of
Engineering and Mines, one for
the School of Business Adminis-
tration, ' and the’ sixth, a large
hangar-type structure, will be used
for indoor sports. The University
has been offered several buildings,
but no‘ decision will be made for
at least a week.

British Universities
Open to Americans

The prominent universities in
Great Britain plan to hold “sum-
mer schools” for ‘Ameircan stu-
dents during July and early Au-
gust, 1947. They are the Univer-
sity of Oxford, the University of
Birmingham, and Aberdeen uni-
versity.

The courses deal with European
civilization in the Twentieth Cen-
-tury at Oxford; English Literature,
1500-1640, at Birmingham; and
history, economics, and education,
at Aberdeen.

Graduates of accredited schools
with the degree of B. A. and those
with suitable qualiﬁcations who
are undergraduates will be con-
sidered for admission to these
courses.

Students interested in these ex-
change studies are directed to
submit applications to the Insti-
tute of International Education, 2

ak Jhn Milich of Geneva tips the ball away from a Panther

in the Geneva-Pitt tilt which the latter won, 57-47.

Panthers Win Seventh .
In Rough Melee, 57 -47

In a game more reminiscent of football than basketball,
Pit‘t’s smooth functioning ﬁve notched its seventh victory of
the campaign by trouncing Geneva, 54-47 at the stadium Sat-

urday night.

Geneva failed to display any organized offense. They heav-

ed from everywhere at anytime but did manage to collect 14

goals from the ﬁeld. Seven of

these being garnered by John

Milich who topped the scorers
with 15 points.

With the aid of some neat-pick-
offs, Pitt hopped off to a quick
6--0 lead. Stressing possession and
passing superbly, they maintained
the advantage to the quarter when
they led, 15-9.

It was 28-18 at the intermis-
sion and 43-33 at the third period
mark. .

With the exception of a few
brief minutes in the second quar-
ter, the Covenanters were never
in the game. Were it not for ex-
cessive zeal on the part of the
Whistle tooters, Pitt might have
won by a far greater margin.

They levied 34 fouls against
the Carlsonmen while Geneva
was tagged with an even 30. Most
of the Pitt misdemeanors were for
blocking. In addition to some nifty
hipping, the Covenanters display-
ed an amazing efficiency 'at‘ mas-
saging Panther ribs with their
elbows.

GAGE SLANTS. . .

It was Nate App1e’s "last ap-
pearance on the home courts. He
tallied 13 points and it was the
third time this season that he has
led the Pitt scorers.

In the second quarter follow-
ing an adverse ruling by the
officials,‘ Slim Ransom, Geneva
coach, removed his ‘cagers from
the floor, After a short pow-
wow» they returned and Pitt
was awarded a technical foul
by the harassed officials.

it two in a row for the Panthers.

Westminster Attempts
Repeat Win Over Pitt

Dembinski, McLhinney et al,
better known as Westminster,
play host to the Panthers Satur-
day night at Farrell.

The Panther-Titan clash in
January was the roughest tilt of
the home season. Following a near
riot, the Titans copped a close 54-
45 decision. "

With Dodo Canterna back in the
lineup and the Pitt passing at-
tack working \ nicely, the Pan-
thers are expecting to even the
season’s series.

However they must stop Chet

Dem-binski and Bill McLhinney
who average close to 15 points
per game. Smooth ﬂoor play by
six foot, four inch Dembinski plus
McLhinney’s one-handed heaves
have brought the Titans victory
throughout‘the season.

6 Don Wilde, a South High pro-
duct and brother of Gus and
Ralph, members of
Panthers tank teams before the
war, led thescqring. Wilde copped
the 60-yard free style in :31.4:

rans Roes I71-fews City
With Personal Interest

Frans Roes, president of the Pitt Cosmopolitan club, hails from
Oosterbeck, a small town in central Holland. and he‘s Dutch to the
core. 01' serious mein butwith a gay twinkle behind horn-rimmed
spectacles. he’s that peculiarly pleasant combination of dykes and

tulips‘.

He speaks oi’ home not as Frans Roes, a Netherlands exchange

student at Pitt, but as an emissary of Holland, 21 personal repre-
sentative of the land of woodenO ~

shoes and windmills. Holland has
impressed the  . . ......... ..

nation to regain

this the in e

Along with
high m o r a 1
standards, conservative customs,
and indomitable spirit, Frans con-
siders emphasis on the intellectual
as one of Holland’s salient assets.
Education is big and a revered
word in the. Dutch lexicon.

The average American student
would be overwhelmed by the rid-
idness and scope of Dutch edu-
cation. A speaking knowledge of
Dutch, German, French, and En-
glish as well as background cours-
es in differential calculus were
prerequisites’ for admittance to

to the war.

All school a.cti.vity is strictly ;

academic; whatever social life ex-
ists is found in the large societies

- independent of the university and

often claiming as many as six
hundred members. These societies
sponsor lectures?“ on politics, phil-
osophy, rhetoric, and the arts;
their avowed purpose is to develop
the student’s personality which
would otherwise be neglected.
Frans was working for his doc-
tor’s degree in electrical engineer-
ing when a scholarship from the
Netherlands-American foundation,
an adjunct of the Institute of In-
ternational Education, brought
him to America in March of 1946.

A He’s studying industrial engineer-

ing at Pitt and observing local
industry with an eye to practical
application of Smoky City tech-
niques to manufacturing in Hol-
land.

For Frans Roes, this is all part
of a ‘personal program; under-

standing for world peace, educa-
tion and preparation for a great-
er Holland of tomorrow.

America's foremost authority on young people’; problem:

 

to gild the lily!

Your dress is all over ﬂowers . ..so you clip ﬂower sprays '
to your ears, and poke a posyi in your hair. A ‘
_ blooming ﬂower garden no less. Your suit is tailored,
gold buttons‘ march down your front...so you load your
wrists with gold, clamp 11 big gold pin to your chest (north
of fraternity pin position) and anchor more gold to your
lobes. From the front you blaze with-gilt like the uniform
of a very small country. Your navy dress is good, then you
twist a splashy stiff scarf around your neck, pull
on giddy gloves and shoes, clamp your middle in a wide
belt, and toss an enormous satchel bag_over your shoulder.
You’re a strong girl to carry so much splash!
One splurge of color...a single striking accessory...will pep
up your costume. But a fireworks display will make your aud'i- ,
once" dizzy. That clutter is overdoing it.
A little eyeshadow...a dash of just-righl lipstick...a ﬂick of
yourlfavorite scent .. .will point you up, too. But a little goes

a long way.

If you bede.ck'yourscll' with geegaws and warpaiut...
you make YOU insigniﬁcant. YOU are overwhelmed.
Of course, if y’ou’re trying to hide . ..you needn’t. pay any

attention to all this!

is indelible!

 

 

\ Let bells clang...let horns honk...let dates
’wait...a girl simply can’t go out without lip-
stick! Why, you'd feel absolutely undressed!
“ You'd rather go without your girdle!
But if you really cared how you lool:ed...you’d leave oﬂ O
a lot of your baubles, gimcracks and dingledangles. When
you're all macked out for going places, it is a temptation

JUSl' Red--a clean, vigor-
ous, go-wifh-everyfhing shade . ..
irresistible in lip uppeol.Won’t
stay on forever-how could a
fellow let it? But the impression
Just Red lips leave on his heart

ning the places you’ll go to, and the thiiiigs. 

you’ll do. Start saving for it today!
