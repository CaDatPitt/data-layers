_ byGL/ENDA MINSHULL

If students attending the debate
Wednesday night between conser-
vative columnist James Kilpa trick
and radical lawyer William.Kunst-
ler anticipated a heated discus-
sion, they were disappointed by
the lukewarm clash between the

'. two figures.

The topic to be discussed was
“Resolved: That the rulings of the
Supreme Court tend to protect
criminals at the expense of law-
abiding citizens and society in
general.” ,.

But the exchange eventually be-

*'“""zame a discussion of law in Amer-

1C3.

. Kilpatrick opened the debate
with an indictment of the Warren
court, whose rulings “required
every cop to be a William-Kunst-
ler.” The Warren court’-s deci-
sions, he arguedfliave tipped the

balance of law in favor of the ac- ,

cused.” -

had in 1830,” when federal juries
had the option of deciding law as
well as guilt of the accused.

What was billed as a debate had
turned into a mutual indictment
of the judicial system by liberal
and conservative alike.

During the questioning period
following the speeches’, Kilpat-
rick and Kunstler, while acknow-
ledging the probability of a con-
servative bench, disagreed on the

‘ credentials of Nixon’s recent ap-

pointees to the Supreme Court,
William Rehnquist and Lewis Pow-
ell.

Referringto, an FBI publication,
in which Powell gave‘ his view-
points, Kunstler felt.that,Powell’s
anti-‘communism would not make

' him a qualified member of the
bench, and he also criticized Rehn-
quist’s position on Civil Rights.

Kilpatrick' allowed himself to

’ display more emotion than he had

"I hate the law. It is the control
mechanism of the ruling class.’_’

Widening the scope of the de-

Bailey elected president

I by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Tom Bailey has been elected
first Student Government Board
president.

‘He was elected by a plurality
vote of the undergraduate student
body in a general election Wednes-
day. ,

Also elected were six Board
members: David Bluey, Terry
Weaver, Walt Wills, Robert Stack,
Ken Krenicky, and Terry Sadler.

Bailey was elated by both his and
his‘ fellow officers’ elections.

“I can’t believe it,” he said.
‘‘I’m pretty excited. I’m lucky to
have these Board members be-
hind mp.” ’ '

He added that he wants to in-
volve the unsuccessful candidates
during his term of office.

One thousand eight hundred and
thirty-five students voted in the
election, nearly doubling last
year’s turnout of 961.

The election was the first un-
der the new Student Government
Constitution ratified Dec. 6.

Student Government Elections
Committee Chairman Arnie Stein-
berg attributed the greater turn-
out to the larger number of inde-
pendent candidates (18) running
and the types of campaigns they
ran.

“I think the apathy was dispell-
ed by the type of campaign run,”
Steinberg said. “You could call it
a\‘smear campaign.”’

He‘ explained that the candi-
‘dates brought out a greater
amount of previous student gov-
ernment issues for the student
body to ponder. *

The breakdown of votes cast in
K the election are as follows:

President—-Bailey, 654; Dennis
Concilla, 489; Bill Small, 242; John
Frye, 159; Marcus Zolnier, 150,
and David Krell (write-in candi-
date),22. '

A "Bitch Day" against Szabo
Food Service, organized by a
group of Tower B Resident As-
sistants. elicited complaints rang-
ing from cold food to cold em-
ployees.

:"§.rvice Director. estimated that

Szabo received about 300 writ-
ten responses during Wednesday’s
"Bitch Day,” in addition to six

or seven, phone calls and visits _

I

from six groups of diners. He‘

characterized much of the criti-
cism as valid.

“In all sincerity, in all hon-
esty,” he said, “I would say that
the response was good. It was,
matter of fact, overwhelming.

I feel that many of ‘the gripes _

students made were legitimate.”

"Some of the others.” he add-
ed, “were raunchy, downright ob-
scene."

The most frequent complaints.
said Provoznik, concerned cold
food. too many fried foods. and
the belligerence of employees who
serve the food. Some of the res-
ponses. he revealed, werefav-
orable. 1

"Many did realize that the
quality of the food has improv-
ed,” he said. . ' A

“Bitch Day” was conceived by
a group of,TowerB RA’s tired of
listening to complaints about
Szabo that, when relayed .to the
Housing Office, were never act-
ed on,-

r

  

A ;'_S;zabo,. ,Fi.oo_d-, .Servic'e'_.has ihgld 

a lot~of complaints thatphave nev-
er been heard,” said one of the

V RA’s.

"Whenever we transfer a com-
plaint." ‘said another. "nothing
happens. They say, ‘Well. the
kids d_on’tbitch aboutit.""

The RA’s posted signs announc-
ing, “Bitch Day” throughout the
Towers and lists of phone numbers
of Housing personnel to whom
complaints about Szabo could be
directed. ’

During lunch Wednesday. they
quietly patrolled the Towers Ca-
feteria. distributing about 800
"Bitch Day Complaint Sheets“ to
interested students.

For the most part. the RA’s
seemed pleased with "Bitch Day‘s’

' results, though one criticized stu-

dents‘ resignation to food service
problems.

“The only,thing that got me a lit-
tle bit,” he said, “was that some
students were cynical. They said,
‘It’s not going to work.’ ”

Provoznik indicated that Szabo
will take steps to alleviate some
of the “bitches" reported. To
help, insure hot food, he ‘said. Sza-
bo managers would themselves

lines, giving student managers

But he warned, that the best of

intentions would’ not enable Sza-

bo, which serves roughly 500 ’
people in the Towers Cafeteria daily,

to "please 100 per cent of the
people 100 percent of the time.”

Chairman Steinberg suffered

two broken toes in a voting ma- _.

chine accident.

.“The. front left wheel of .a Tow-_’p"_

right foot and gave me a chipped

fracture of my little toe and a

slight fracture of the fourth toe,”
Steinberg said.

The accident occurred when, p

Steinberg was helping move the.
‘voting machines intothe Towers

Tuesday. He was pulling the ma-. 

chine, while another worker push-
ed.

According to Steinberg, the man
“forgot I was pulling” and let go
of the machine, causing it to run
wildly over Steinberg’s foo/t.

Steinberg, however, was’ non_- , .

plussed-by the accident. 1
“I’ve used a cane in three of the

last four student government elec-. , I

tions,” Steinberg said.

During 1969 elections Steinberg
used a cane because of an injury
to the ligamentsof his right ankle _
sustained in a fallof 21 feet. Last
year, Steinberg was suffering-
from two fractures of his left leg,
resulting from a football injury.

Although he said he did not
want to overestimate the im-

candidate he knew was trying

to get a piece of it.”

The issue of campus activism
apparently tak_en over by a
quasi-apathetic existence drew

’ a draw] from Kilpatrick.

“Well. .I’m not sure apa-

manifestations. Demonstrations

Kilpatrick. said that the re-
cent dismissal, subject to ap-
peal. of a Stanford professor

. for "engaging in a pattern of

conduct that constitutes a con-
tinual challenge to the univer-
sity” was quite legitimate in-
consideration of facts that the
professor did indeed encourage
incitementto riot. v '

Reminded that Nobel prize
winning chemist "Linus Pauling
had publicly characterized the
dismissal ‘as "a great blow to
freedom of speech,” Kilpatrick

smiled and replied, “He would."

“This business of inhibiting
freedom of speech,” added K_il-
patrick, “is a bunch of baloney,
it’s garbage.”

Kilpatrick expressed ambiva-

"performance in office..He said

that Nixon has fulfilled some but
not all of his campaign pro-
mises. »
“There are a few" he fulfilled
rather" well. The pledge to put con-

as in federal finance. . . He led
us to believe that he was a fiscal
conservative on deficit spending
but this year’s deficit will be the

Nixon’s re-election chances, .

said Kilpatrick, “are excellent."

Will he take Agnew with him?

“I think he’ll keep Agnew as a

A point in Nixon’s favor, Kil-

Survey reveals attitudes

by RICH EULER

A recent study compiled by the '

Student Consulting Project, a Pitt
organization, revealed that busi-
nessmen in the Hill District are no
longer willing to accept outside
help in their struggle to maintain
solvency.

According to William Tiga Tita,
a graduate business student here
at the University and one of the co-
ordinators of the study, the results
of the survey indicate that most
‘black businessmen consider of-
fers of outside help just so much.
talk.

“For years the black business-
man has been hearing how certain
programswere going to improve
Tita explained.

ghetto today is much the same as
it was in the past, and the black
businessman has begun to wonder
about these promises. The result
is that he no longer has any confi-
dence in . development programs
proposed to him by outsiders.”

"As a result of the stiidy, he said,
Student Consulting Project (SCP)
was forced to revise its methods
of dealing with black business-

_ men. 4 V
2 “We discovered that we ‘had

been operating in the dark—that
we really didn’t know the needs of
the black businessman,” Tita re-
marked.

Samme Thompson, a Westing-

"tihouse Electric executive and co-

coordinator of the study, saw
three uses for the information
gained from the survey.

. “First, the study gave our or-

- ganization some direction in deal- -

ing with the black businessman,"
said..Thompson. “Second, with the

_"statistics we gleaned we were

able to print a directoryof busi-

gﬁvnesses in the Hill District which

will let people outside the black
community discover the services

the Hill District has to offer. Final-

ly, this directory will also enable
Hill District businessmen to find
out more about each other——enable
them to cooperate with one an-

), other.

David Freedmanof the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs, who helped coordinate the
project, said that the study re-
vealed that attraction of outside
businesses into‘ the black com-
munity is the most important as-
pect of black economic develop-
ment.

, i “To me, black capitalism means .
black businesses getting into the
_ mass economy,” Freedman said.

‘,‘If the Hill District or any black
community is ever to become
more than a self-contained‘ eco-
nomy, outside contracting is es-
sentiail.”

Besides the directory, the SCP

also has plans for a group-buying
program. Under this setup,several
private businesses would get to-
gether to purchase _an item“'of‘
common need. By purchasing
items in alarger quantity, the
SCP reasons; greater .-discounts
can be obtained.

- within,
~~~_role is no longer to work for the

 

3

 Black entreprerteurs ‘wary of help

There are also plans for more
iirectoriesin other parts of the
city, and the SCP is encouraging
the University to buy from black
entrepreneurs by means of its
"Buy-Black Campaign."

.As Freedman sees it, the SCP
must strive to coordinate these fi-
nancial aspects of its‘program
with the technical aspects of run-
ning a‘ business.

“People aren’t going to be in-
terested in proper methods of
management if they don’t have
thecapital to manage,”, he said.
“but they’re not going to use their

capital ‘effectively if they don’t it

know common business proce-

. dures like bookkeeping.”

.-In addition, said Freedman, the
SCP must make the black busi-
nessman realize that his indivud-
ual problems are part of a greater
community problem.

“The major efforts in-'.'the area
of economic development in the
black community must come from
” added Thompson. “Our

black businessman, but, rather, to
work with him.”

Hitchhiking is an art form.

satisfactorily explain the motives of the

talking about money, it’s cheap. But what
is the price, say, of‘ three hours of time
lost? How do we convert a weather-beaten

f ‘if,'we could, we would probably discover
‘ that the cost of hitch_hiking is dearer than

 ’Then, of course, there is the belief that

Ride thumbers dream

of open door policy

and the sense of self-righteousness experi-
enced by the driver are both dwarfed by
the mutual sense of relief when the pass-
enger slams the door good-by. I

The hitchhiker, after, all, knows that the
guy behind the/wheel is a hard-working si-
lent American who_sweats plenty to earn
money to buy this goddam car and who has
little sympathy for kids too lazy to go out
and work like he did (does), and the driver,
for his part, resents the fact that the kid is
probably the spoiled-rotten son of a steel.
magnate. or, worse, a faggot who at the ‘
next red light will pull out a knife andlet in
his faggoty, junky friends, who have laid an
ambush.

So, knowing what they know of each other
and loath to learn more, they limit conver-
sation to banal patois and appreciative
grunts. The hitchhiker gets there, the driv-
er earns conscience-soothing brownie
points, hi, thanks, and take care. -

“ Conversely, there are those who main-
tain that hitchhiking offers rare moments
of solitude, time to ponder life’s impon-

derables.. Love, dialectical materialism,

capital punishment, Richard Brautigan.

But for the hitchhiker, time is the oppres-
'sor, the strongman bending all thoughts
into this balled , up question that, like
Eliot’s, drops onto your-plate: Will I ever
get ‘a ride? Brautigan becomes less and
less important, unless he suddenly drives
down the road and opens the door.

Probably the most widely-held belief

about-hitchhiking’s popularity is that it is

a manifestation of youth’s unselfish sub-
culture, an each for all, musketeerian
service, kinda like I gotta car, you don’t,
so hop in. Certainly, there are elements
of an egalitarian goodwill here.

But ask any woman who’ hitchhikes how
many times she has been picked up by a
woman. Though, the motives of hitchhikers
are at times obscure, the thoughts of those

,_who, pick them up are too often transpar-

ent.

Hitchhiking, if it must be categorized,
is an art form, a mode of individual_expres-
sion complete with its own folk heroes,
bards, and apostates." Its medium is its
message, an art where being there is more
important than getting there. It has as

many schools and styles as it has practi- .

tioners, like the Pitt student who thumbs

the 23 miles from his home in Natrona
Heights to campus daily, and who, If you‘
ask him, will patiently explain the super-,

’Middle of the road situation’

Marlboros cater to eclectic tastes

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

The village of Marlboro. Vt.,
rather popular center for music since the initiation
of a summer musical festival there some years ago,
featuring such respected artists as Pablo Casals and

Rudolph Serkin.

has become a

Based on his ‘Yale reminiscences, it is probably
one of his inferior compositions

The presto movementwhich the composer him-
self called a joke, was as much a viewing experi-
ence as a listening one as each musician wove his

own crazy quilt of sound.

Pittsburghers received a bit of this festival

this past week when its widely known trio presented
a concert at the Carnegie-Music Hall. Mitchell An-
drews, piano; Gerald Tarack, violin, and Charles
McCracken, cello, the artists who make up the
Marlboro Trio, presenteda concert devoted largely
to lesser known works a trois from the chamber mu-

sic repertoire.

A little known (and perhaps rightly so) Seren-
ade of Vincent Persichetti, composed in 1941, got
things off to a rather dull start. One gets the im-
pression that although Perischetti heads the com-
position department at Julliard, he still has some-
thing to learn about putting a coherent musical

work together. -

, Much more welcome and interesting was a trio
of Joseph Haydn, which followed. Haydn, better
known for his string quartets than his trios, wrote
both types of compositions in the same vein. A deli-
cate, musical vitality was conveyed throughout the

work.

Another modern work followed as a little known
"trio” of Charles Ives appeared on the program.

memory.

All Ivesis unfortunately not good Ives, as was
certainly the case here. College days are certainly
a good programatic subject, but one fears the com-
poser was rather overcome by his experience (to
the discomfiture of the audience-).

The always welcome Opus 87 Trio of Brahms

‘ brought the entire evening to a lushly romantic con-
clusion. Filled with gypsy melodies, the Brahms
never fails to leave a wealth of melodies in one’s

Throughout the evening, string intonation was
fairly good and the pianist showed his delicate key-
board technique. One cannot exactly say that the

program was a profound one but rather one which

Encouraged by the confirma-

leader in registration of 18-20
year old voters, the Allegheny
County Board of Elections is con-
tinuing its vigorous campaign.

‘ Early in October,-Jane Thomp-

son of the Citizenship Information A

Center credited this high instance
of registration to the efforts of
the County Board of Elections. The
Board, she‘ explained, enlisted the
aid of various groups, including
the League of Women Voters, and
launched ‘an early and concen-
trated campaign.

W. Holmes Isler, administra- 5

tive assistant of the Board of Elec-
tions, said that the Board is still
actively encouraging both stu-
dents and general citizens to
register.

“We are getting ready for an;

other general field registration

Riding the crest of a four game
winning streak, the Pitt Panthers
amble into Wolfpack country to-
morrow where they meet North
Carolina State in Raleigh at 8 p.m.

_ Bucknell became Pitt’s latest_
victim Wednesday night in the

Field House as the cagers over-
came a sloppy start to romp. pass
the Bisons, 91-67. The Cat attack
at one stretch was so devastating
that for the first nine minutes of
the second half the Bisons could
only salvage two points.

Assistant Coach Fran Webster
commented‘ on,Pitt’s slow start.
“You _have~to understandthat we
have three boys getting over the

. flu. Mike Paul and'Cleve Edwards

are still sick and Bill Knight just
got over it._ - T

“Bucknell played real aggres-
sively in the beginning of the
game,” continued the defensive
mentor. “They took the ball?away
from us and kept the score close.”

The closest the Bisons came
was 16-15 on a layup by Jim Dona-
van with 12:50 left in the‘ half. The
Panthers popped in the next five
points and from-then on there was
no contest. Four Cats battled for
Panther scoring honors, with
Kent Scott finishing on top with
18, Mike -Paul (17), Bill Knight
(16), and Carl Morris (14) follow-
ed close on his heels.

. "Bison 6'-5 sophomore Paul ‘Kerr _
‘led the field with 24 points,‘ manv'

Tom Burleson, a 7-4 farmboy from ‘

rural North Carolina, leads the at-

they (the Panthers) are going to
have to‘ “keep the ball away from

the ball game.

“I think we can beat them down
there,” Webster added, “but we
have to play with all we’ve got.
They’re a team like Davidson,
only they have Burleson.”

    Gymnasts belt    

by RICK ROSENTHAL

The Pitt gymnasts, led by three
first place finishes by Dick Pribis.
overcame West Virginia and the
judges Wednesday night in Mor-
gantown, to post a 132.05-127.90
win, their second in a row.

"When dealing with non—league
judges.“ asserted Pitt’s Assistant
Coach 12 Perez about the officiat-
ing, “we face the risk of encoun-
tering incompetent judges."

The officiating appeared erratic.
One of the judges, a professor at
West Virginia, Dr.Al3il1 Schweiker,
seemed only to post his score af-
ter comparing the scoring of the
other three judges. This was only
one part of the over-all effect.

In gymnastics, of the four scores’

which are posted, rating the per-
formance of? an athlete in the
event_, the highest and the lowest

1 albeei,

are discarded while the remain-
ing two scores are retained.’The
difference between two middle
scores is not allowed to exceed a
graduated scale from .1 to 1, de-
pending on how high the scores
are. '

However. Coach Perez pointed
out that the judges allowed the
difference to exceed the scaled
ceiling six times over the course
of the evening.

Of the four judges_onl_v one. Jer-
ry Spencer, was a card carrying
member of the Federation of Inter-
national Gymnasts. The other three
were not certified.
