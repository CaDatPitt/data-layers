osvar says to invest in

colleges is to invest in (1.8.

By Dirk Kaufman
The Pitt News

iWesley Posvar, president of the
University of Pittsburgh, said in an
interview yesterday that newly
appointed secretary of education,
William J. Bennett, is “simply wrong
in his appraisal of the benefits of
higher education.”

Bennett harshly criticized the effi-
ciency of the college curriculum in
America today at his first press con-
ference held earlier this week. He
claimed that students are being
“ripped off” by colleges that have a

“misguided marketplace philoso-
phy.”

' Posvar said that an investment in
colleges is “the best investment the
nation can make to stimulate eco-
nomic development.” He added that
“human capital is the first kind of
capital needed.”

He said that Bennett is wrong in
saying that there are too many stu-
dents attending colleges right now.
At the conference, Bennett said, “If
my own son, who is now 10 months
old came to me and said, ‘You prom-
ised to pay for my tuition at Har-
vard; how about giving me $50,000
instead to start a little business?’, I
might think that was a good idea.”
He said that it is “reasonable to ask”

whether so many young people
should go to college.

“His assertion that we don’t need
as many students isn’t realistic,”said
Posvar. He said that Bennett com-
pared percentages of young people
attending college in our country to
those in others, and that we had a
much higher percentage. Posvar
explained, however, that those
countries have further to go in their
own higher education programs.
Therefore, he felt it was unfair for
Bennett to compare the colleges here
with those in other countries.

Posvar said, “The core of the
problem lies in elementary educa-
tion. ” He said elementary and secon-

Trustees discuss
Sullivan Principle

By Julie Bavdek
The Pitt News

“Members of the [Pitt], board of
trustees acknowledge the real prob-
lems of apartheid in South Africa,”
said chairman Robert Kirby at the
board of trustees’ meeting Wednes-
day. “In accordance with the recom-
mendations of the Student
Government Board, we will have the
Finance and Investment Committee
re-examine the Sullivan Principles.”

Adopted in 1978, the Sullivan
Principles advocate that companies
doing business in South Africa take
steps to avoid discrimination in the
workplace. Chief Judge of the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Rug-
gero J. Aldisert, who ‘presented the
SGB resolution for divestment, told
the board that the Sullivan Princi-
ples are not as viable now as they
once were in 1978. 

Aldisert continued, saying that
students must understand the com-
plex nature of the problem. How-
ever, he added, “we must continue to
refine our efforts in this regard
[against apartheid].”

“Even if they did work as planned,
which they don’t,” said SGB

member Avery Abrams, “they still‘
only affect one percent of the total.

work force. Their negative effects far
outweigh the positive.”

According to Abrams, SGB
believes that the Sullivan Principles

are merely rhetorical and (10 not

Mugging

have day

By Dirk Kaufman
The Pitt News

Four of the seven juveniles
accused in a string of muggings in
Oakland have been sent to area de-
tention centers by Juvenile Court
Judge R. Stanton Wettick, accord-
ing to Beverly Bush, assistant direc-
tor of the Juvenile Court.

The alleged leader of the group
has been given a three-year sentence
and must serve 18 months of that
time before he is eligible for parole.
He was charged on all 13 counts of
robbery that were brought against
him. The remaining assailants will
be sentenced at a later date. No
names were released.

The youths, all Oakland residents,
targeted pedestrians walking alone
in a 13-block area along Forbes

address the basic question of politi-
cal rights for blacks.

Abrams also said that SGB is call-
ing for total divestment of all uni-
versity funds connected with the
Republic of South Africa. This
includes any university funds which
will be or already are invested in
stocks, securities or other obliga-
tions of any bank or financial insti-
tution that makes direct loans to
South Africa. These, he said, should
be withdrawn, as well as university
monies invested in a subsidiary of a
U.S. company operating in South
Africa or in a national corporation
of South Africa.

. If approved by the board of trus-
tees, divestment may begin to take
effect two years from the date the
proposal is adopted. However, Pres-
ident Wesley Posvar said, “I don’t
think it's ever going to come to an up
or down vote.” He added that “Tutu
himself favors more investment.” ,

Kirby agreed, “We can’t destroy
the livelihood of South Africa.”

Other issues addressed at Wed-
nesday’s board meeting included the
election of Anthony J.F. O’Reilly as
a charter trustee and Thomas H.
O’Brien as a term trustee. The board
also formally elected Dr. Thomas
Detre to the position of senior vice
president for the health sciences.

A new associate degree program
in respiratory therapy at Pitt-Johns-
town was approved. This program is
accredited and will require no cur-
riculum or budget adjustments to
affect the change in degree status.

victims were foreign students

According to police reports, the
gang usually trapped the victims by
first asking them what time it was
and then using a knife or gun to
force the victims to give up their
money.

In most cases, the group was only
able to steal between $5 and $30, but
one victim was forced to give $230 to
the thieves. Another victim was
injured and had his glasses broken
after being punched in the eye by on-e

Bush said that of the three who
were not sentenced, one faces
another hearing on Feb. 23 after
participating in a lineup, the second
is on probation and the third has
been released after charges against
him were dropped.

Troubles
in Latin

America

By Sonny Leone
The Pitt News

The Center for Latin American
Studies and the Department of Eco-
nomics presented a lecture on eco-
nomic conditions in Latin America.

The lecture, entitled, “The Crisis
of Development in Latin America,"
was delivered by Carlos Diaz-
Alejandro on Thursday afternoon.
Diaz-Alejandro is a professor of
economics at Columbia University
and is internationally known for his
works on development, interna-
tional trade and the economy of
Latin America. He received his
Ph.D. from M.I.T. and has taught at
the University of Minnesota, Yale
University, Oxford and the Univer-
sidad Catolica dc Rio de Janeiro.

The lecture concentrated on eco-
nomic and political conditions prev-
alent in Latin America. Diaz-
Alejandro drew parallels between
current inflationary conditions and
those which existed in the 1930s.
Both periods were severe contradic-
tions in terms of trade and technolo-
gical development.

Diaz-Alejandro examined at least
three similarities between the United

States and the combined countries
of Latin America: the “substantial

Pittsburgh PI
. exhibits four artists’ work

By Lisa Gordon
The Pitt News

An exhibition of four artists is
being shown at the Pittsburgh Plan
for Art, located at 407 South Craig
Street through March I0.

The artists —- Kimberly Burleigh,
Stephen Hankin, Lilian Pierce and
Mary Weidner — are quite diversi-
fied in their styles, making for a‘ very
good, varied show.

Burleigh’s works stem from pop
art and are concerned with media
images. She makes things known
that would otherwise be hidden or
passed by in today’s fast-paced life-
styles. This making known of the
hidden projects an eeriness in her
works.

In “Mental Telepathy,” she shows
a contestant on “Wheel of Fortune”
guessing the puzzle answer, which is
mental telepathy. The barely visible
N is suggestive. The greenish shades
contrasted with the blacks give the
viewer a spooky feeling.

Burleigh received her M.F.A.
from Indiana University in 1980. In
the last seven years, she has exhi-
bited 25 times.

Hankin’s works are colorful and
realistic. A native of Pittsburgh,
mostly he shows Oakland and por-

traits. “Bouquet Street” is a cheerful
work done in bright colors. The
lemon yellow and ﬂourescent
orange enhance the warm and happy
mood of the work. His precise
details and shading are a real work
of craftsmanship.

Hankin received his M.F.A. in
painting from the Pratt Institute,
New York, in I969. His undergradu-
ate studies were at CM U. This year
he was honored with the CMU Visit-
ing Artist Award.

Pierce’s works are two-shaded,
geometric forms. The works are
acrylic collages on canvas. Her
forms are white with a background
of blue, yellow and black.

Pierce was educated at the Center
for Creative Arts, Cranbrook Art
Academy and Wayne State Univer-
sity. She was once head of the color
and design department at the Center
for Creative Studies.

Weidner’s works are abstractions.
Her work “Release” is very chaotic
and alive. It creates a tension within
the viewer because of its gushing,
explosive scene. The yellow back-
ground is bright; there is nothing
dull about this work. This piece is
one of the best in the gallery and
illustrates her talent. Weidner
received her M.F.A. in 1975 from
Washington University. In the past
five years her works have been

shown in almost 50 exhibitions.

The artists were selected by the
Pittsburgh Plan's board of directors.
They consist of community and art
leaders of Pittsburgh.

Jim Nelson, the curater, said that
the show was not ' difficult to put
toghether because “We are fortunate
enough to have portable walls so we
can create the right space needed for
each artist. It is a process of trying
until you get it right.”

I The Pittsburgh Plan for Art is a
non-profit exhibition space funded
by private foundations, member-
ships, grants and the sale of paint-
ings. The gallery gets 30 percent of
the sale ‘price of a painting.

According to Nelson, “Our func-
tion is to provide the city with art
shows that would otherwise notbe
seen.” I

The gallery is open Tuesday
through Saturday from 10 to 5 and
Sunday from I to 5. It is closed on
Monday.

Hypothetical Bombs

A recent Reagan administration White Paper charges that if
the U.S. doesn’t accelerate military aid to Central American
“freedom fighters,” there could be “a perception that the Soviet
Union can establish a military presence anywhere it chooses.”
The threat posed" by amphibious tanks and armored personnel
carriers, however, is child’s play compared to a recently
revealed U.S. plan to deploy nuclear weapons in Canada,
Bermuda, Iceland and Puerto Rico. ,

The Reagan administration has admitted that nuclear wea-
pons storage facilities and a specially trained team of military
experts are already in place in Puerto Rico to receive the
weapons, even though the treaty prohibiting such deployment
would first have to be abrogated. This action will inevitably
lead to very dangerous consequences. The countries of Central
America are likely to perceive, and justifiably so, that such an
action is a serious threat to their security, necessitating that
increased defense measures be taken by their governments.

According to The New York Times (Feb. 13), one part of the
document, distributed by William Arkin of the Institute for
Policy Studies, authorizes actual deployments of nuclear wea-
pons around the world, and a second part establishes contin-

gency deployments.

Adm. Robert Falls of Canada has charged that the U.S.
holds an immoral attitude in developing these plans without
consulting the host countries. Even though the plans have been
said to be “hypothetical” or relevant “only in a state of emer-
gency,” Adm. Falls has a valid point.

Our government’s total disregard for morality becomes blat-
ant when the Reagan administration succumbs to yielding false
information on the U.S. military presence in Central America
to a congressional committee. It is unfortunate to see the
governing body on which the foundation of our nation rests be
shown such disrespect. The situation becomes even more
shameful when our leaders ask us to believe that a communist
government, an implicit evil we have never known, warrants
the development of plans to deploy more nuclear weapons
around the globe without prior consultation with the countries
receiving them. Surely 10 years (the document was dated 1975)
is plenty of time to di_scuss deployment of more unneeded

nuclear weapons.

If to be critical of the honesty of our government’s intentions
when it has obviously lied is to be “radical,” then by all means,
let's get radical in the name of humanity. ’

iThanks, Guys

After looking at the front-page
photo (Jan. 30) entitled “Ice Floes
Choke the Allegheny River,” we
were enraged to find that the Ohio
River had been renamed. We even.
missed the dedication ceremony.

‘Now that we have the Mononga-
hela and Allegheny Rivers meeting
at the point to form the Allegheny
River, does this mean Three Rivers
Stadium will be renamed “Two Riv-
erss Stadium”?

Seriously, we enjoy having you
(the Pitt News staff) test our ability
to play “What’s wrong with this pic-
ture?” Using our keen sense of per-
ception, we deduced that the Ohio
River had not been renamed. We

called Mayor Caligiuri just to be.

sure. He assured us that none of the
rivers had been renamed. You really
had us going for a while. Thanks
again, and please continue this
amusing contest. '

More jersey

Concerning Bob Travers’ recent
article titled “On Philly, New Jersey
and Babe Ruth:" On what basis does
he make his statements? Spending a
“few hours taking in New York”
does, in no way, give him the right to
comment on New Jersey. Traveling
on the New Jersey Turnpike to the
Lincoln Tunnel is not a grand view
of the entire state.

We have lived in New Jersey most
of our lives. Mr. Johnson is a Jersey
City native, and Mr. Wilson has
been a North Brunswick resident for
the past 12 years. We both feel that
we are better qualified to comment
on the quality of living in our home
state.

Obviously, Mr. Travers did not
see all of North Bergen, Jersey City,
Newark, Elizabeth and Bayonne. In
Jersey City, for example, there is
Liberty State Park and a rapidly
developing waterfront complex
known as Newport City. Both face
the Statue of Liberty as well as the
breathtaking New York skyline.

Negotiations are ‘going on to
locate a film studio in Jersey City,
housed in what is now a National
Guard armory. Why Jersey City?
Because property taxes are not as
high in New Jersey as they are in
New York. ‘

As for the living conditions, we

suggest you ask the residents of the
Heights section of Jersey City if they
would like their newly built lofts and
condominiums condemned or the
renaissance it is currently undergo-
ing halted.

Every city has its poorer sections.
Being a native Pittsburgher, Mr.

Travers should_not overlook the»

area surrounding Fifth Avenue
High School and the Hill District as
examples of urban blight.

While on the subject of urban
blight, Travers’ statement that New
Jersey means “urban blight” in Latin
is totally absurd and unfounded. We
put it to you, Mr. Travers: Have you
ever heard of, much less visited,
THE New Jersey Shore? Have you
ever been to Central or South Jer-

'sey, Somerset, Middlesex, Mercer

or Ocean Counties? Have you ever
visited and experienced the beauty
of the Gothic architecture at Prince-
ton Unive_rsity? _

If you have an urge to travel to
Las Vegas, but you do not have the
time nor the motivation to ﬂy 3,000
miles, why not try a short excursion
to Atlantic City? This is the city of
saltwater taffy,’ the Miss America
contest, luxurious casinos and the
world-famous, eight-mile-long
boardwalk. .

Have you ever been to the Dela-
ware Water Gap, Barnegat Light-
house, the Meadowlands Sports
Complex, Cape May, the Pine
Barrens, Lake Hopatcong?

Please, Mr. Travers, do not pass
judgments on a subject until you
have experienced the good along
with the bad.

We pose this question: Why do
illustrious names such as Herschel
Walker, Lawrence Taylor and Eddie
Murphy make their homes in Upper
Saddle River, N.J.? These people
have enough money to live any-
where they choose. For example,
Eddie Murphy is one of the hottest
stars around; he could commute

’ between Los Angeles and New York

if he so desired. Instead, he resides in
New Jersey. If New Jersey is so bad,
then why don’t these people move?

On a final note, we have one more
question: Why is this article in the
sports section and not on the editor-
ial page? Mr. Travers is obviously
stating his opinions and not report-
ing the news objectively. Perhaps we
are suffering from mere provincial
bias, but until Mr. Travers experien-
ces the Garden State as we have, we
suggest he keep those opinions to
himself.

Granted, New Jersey may not be
the greatest place in the world to
live, but we are fairly certain that we
are not the only New Jersey resi-
dents he has offended.

To conclude, a message to the
readers: Many people travel through
New Jersey, to New York or else-
where. More than likely, you travel

by way of the New Jersey Turnpike.
This road does not paint a pretty
picture, and it is certainly not what
New Jersey is all about.

Mr T and Mr R

As I skimmed your newspaper for
possible newsworthy articles, I came
across an amusing little letter from
T.R. Owens. Mr. Owens suggested
that we put Mr. T in a position to
deal with the Soviets. Although I
like his ideas, I don't see the need.
We already have an overrated actor
in a high governmental job who tries
to bully his way through the
negotiations.

Although it is a good idea, some-
one beat him to the punch.

Hysteria

Having considered the matter —
of course —— in all of its aspects, I
have decided that there is no excuse
for “Letters to the Editor." I offer
“Rubbish," by Scott T. Singleton,
CAS ’85, as a prime example of why
this offensive mooning of the private
soul should cease.

I am a hysterical type, of course,
but I don't write editorials for The
Pitt News. Why? Simply because I
am lazy, as hysterical types go. You
might say that it was the particularly
stupid quality of Mr. Singleton’s let-
ter which so rudely roused me from
my beauty sleep.

It seems quite evident that Mr.
Singleton has not even made it to the
l8th century when SamuelJohnson
wrote, “Patriotism is the last refuge
of the scoundrel.” The simple fact
that Mr. Singleton uses the words
“four short years ago" in his letter
betrays the fact that he hasn't even
grasped Newton yet, let alone Ein-

Then again, maybe he just doesn’t
know how to write effective prose.

In short, I would like Mr. Sin-

his fellow man. This would be a fine
first step in reality functioning for

From Where I Stand/ N iccol Donnelly

A group of people who have come
to be known as “right-to-lifers"
believe that every fetus conceived
has the right to be born, except in
cases of rape or danger to the life of
the mother.

Some right-to-lifers are ﬁghting
to save the lives of the unborn by
taking lives. Radical factions of this
group have been terrorizing abor-
tion clinics. Recently, National
Organization for Women represen-

tatives have been sitting in the East
Liberty clinic at night, trying to pre-
vent bombing attempts. g

The pro-life Catholic Church has
condemned these bombings. Almost
every official group dealing with
abortion — including most right-to-
lifers — has denounced these acts as
acts of hostility that defeat their
purpose.

The issue of abortion is one that

we come in contact with every day as”

A few things

Yesterday, I finally managed to
shovel the snow off my sidewalk.
Humming to myself, I dutifully sho-
veled strip after strip until I was
almost finished. Suddenly, though, I
rammed the shovel into a crack, jar-
ring my entire body.

“There‘s nothing I hate worse
than running into cracks with my
shovel!” I exclaimed out loud (to my
own embarrassed dismay). As I pon-
dered that thought for a moment, I
began to recall many things I hated
worse than anything. That makes
sense, right?

You know, I really hate running,
at top speed early in the morning
trying to catch the bus. There’s
nothing I hate worse, though, than
arriving in plenty of time tosee the
bus glide by without me. And why
must the driver insist on waving to
me?

I also cringe when thinking about
the times I have fallen asleep on the
bus on my way home. There’s
nothing I hate worse than waking up
three miles past my home and hav-

ing to get off the bus and walk back. .

I find myself somewhat disturbed
when finding dog-doo on my rug at
home. My disturbance transforms
into disguest when I step in that doo.
However, there is nothing I hate
worse than stepping in a particular
mess with both feet. This doesn’t
stop the dog, though.

On mornings when I wake up late,
I will sometimes get breakfast at
McDonald's on my way to school.
As my stomach cries for food, I
order scrambled eggs, sausage and
milk. Several times, though, my
breakfast has been interrupted and
consequently ruined by having to
pick vast amounts of egg shells out
of my teeth. So much for breakfast.

My stomach often craves food at

’ night, too. To satisfy that craving, I

order pizza. Anxious to eat, I swiftly
remove the pizza box lid to find a
cheeseless pizza. There is definitely
nothing I hate worse than discover-
ing that the entire glob of cheese is
plastered to the lid.

I also hate traffic. I often sit there
unable to move in any direction. As
my patience rapidly dwindles, some
jerk always has to beep. There’s
nothing I hate worse than irate driv-
ers who blow their horns. It certainly
never helps me move. ldo get head-
aches from it, though.

Frequently, I’m faced with enter-
ing a Pitt classroom late. Why do
students seat themselves from the
aisles first, leaving only a few seats in
the middle of the row? I haven’t a
clue, and there’s nothing 1 hate

I hate

worse than the outright hostile looks
I get while gracefully stumbling past
the students on my way to an empty
chair. Aside from arriving on time,
what can I do?

Math homework is certainly not a
favorite of mine. In a calculus class I
had, I would slave for hours working
out each problem. As I finished the
last problem, my head would fall to
the table where it remained until
morning. There is nothing I hate
worse, though, than handing in an
assignment only to discover that I
did the wrong problems.

As I stood there, shovel in hand,
pondering about all the things that I
hated worse than anything, I began
to realize how silly that statement
was. I guess I could have rambled
forever about things I often see as
worse than anything else. How
could I really have a whole list of
hates, each one worse than the oth-
ers? Next time, I’ll stop and think
before I make such a blatant
statement. »

Standing there, I almost forgot
what I first set out to do. Much time
had passed, and more snow had
blown onto the sidewalk. I was
almost finished shoveling, but then!
had to begin all over again. You
know, there’s nothing I hate worse
than

Abortion Clinics: hate, violence, and

college students. Statistics show that
most abortions in Pennsylvania are
performed on women aged 18 to 24.

After Feb. l5, Pennsylvania will
discontinue its financial assistance
for abortions. This is not expected to
lower the number of abortions. Lu
Conser, executive director of Sum-
mit Medical Center, said this action
will only force women to prolong the
time before they have the abortion,
which makes the procedure more
risky.

The people (predominantly
women) who work at these clinics
feel that delegalizing abortion would
be the worst possible solution. Dele-
galizing would lead to illegal abor-
tions performed by possibly
unqualified doctors or by people
who are not doctors at all.

Since abortion has been legal for
l2 years, Conser felt that doctors
have improved and advanced the
procedure to the point where there
are rarely any complications. Clinics
also offer counseling before the
abortion and a follow-up appoint-
ment to assure that the woman has
recovered medically and emotion-
ally. The procedure is considered to
be a minor operation when per-
formed under normal circumstan-
ces, with less than a one-percent
complication rate.

According to Conser, Summit
Medical Center has not experienced
any emergencies or complications
since it began performing abortions.
He said that the doctors at the center
do not perform abortions on women
who seem uncertain or who have

‘ been forced into a decision. Through

counseling, many women have been
sent home to reconsider their
decison.

Talking with some Pitt females, a
variety of opinions emerged, both
for and against abortion. Most
women feel there is something to

    

  

      
     
       
       
         
      

human’s compassion

fear in having an abortion, due to
recent threats of violence at many
clinics. Since May I982, there have
been over 30 acts of violence toward
abortion clinics throughout the
country.

During the anniversary of the
legalization of abortion, many of
Pittsburgh’s pro-life groups traveled
to Washington, D.C. President Rea-
gan supported their cry to stop these
“killings.” Mayor Richard Caligiuri
reinforced Reagan’s stand on this
issue.

There were no incidents of vio-
lence in Pittsburgh. Protesters have
picketed the downtown clinics, but
only on Saturdays. No real damage
has been reported by the clinics.
Most of the bombings have been on
buildings that housed only abortion
clinics, while Pittsburgh’s clinics are
in buildings that serve as multi-
purpose facilities.

Conser said the real damage these
protesters do is to the women who

face them. According to Conser, the
data the protesters base their argu-
ments on is outdated. She said that
the fetus they show doesn’t even
resemble those being aborted at the
first trimester. Although some
patients are afraid, most of them are
angry.

The Summit clinic has not had
any major problems, Conser said,
but one problem did arise when
some of the men who accompanied
women to the clinic became angry
and had to be restrained.

Although these clinics are being
harassed, nothing can be done other
than increasing security. People
seeking the service of abortion clin-
ics in Pittsburgh have nothing to
fear. The worst harassment would
be the picketers, who are within their
rights.

As of ‘now, there is no solution to
this split in opinions, since the law
allows a woman to make that deci-
sion for herself.

Spree ends in
carnage

GRAINFIELD, Kan. (UPI) —— It

started with a killing in a restaurant
in Grainﬁeld, Kan., and ended I25
miles away with a shootout outside a
farmhouse ‘near Colby, Kan.
1 Four people, including one sus-
pect, were killed in Wednesday’s
rampage in northwest Kansas. Four
others were injured.

The first victim was the manager
of a Stuckey’s restaurant who appar-
ently died in the robbery. A high
school student found his body.

Shortly after, a state trooper spot-
ted an old car speeding along an
interstate and notiﬁed an undersher-
iff who stopped it. The gunmen
opened fire and wounded the under-
sheriff. The four gunmen then fired
into a grain elevator and wounded
the manager.

Officials said they stole a pickup
and took two hostages, who both
were killed. An officer said, “They
shot them both in the face, I’m told.”

The suspects continued their high-
speed rampage. A roadblock forced
them to turn back and they went to
the farmhouse. The residents were
not home.

A highway patrol spokesman said
three officers caught up with them
and a gunfight erupted in the yard.
One suspect was killed; two others,

mmilill

including a woman, were injured.
The fourth was chased down and
arrested while the three others lay
bleeding in the snow.

Companies fight
fraud

SEATTLE (UPI) ~ The credit
and charge card industry hit multi-
billion dollar figures long ago, with
fraud costs not far behind.

But a larger awareness of the
losses by business and consumers
may help bring the overall theft costs
more in line.

eredith Fernstrom, a senior vice
president with American Express,
talked of the problem earlier this
week in Seattle and said the cost of
credit and charge card fraud has hit
$500 million.

But times are changing and Fern-
strom said that Visa International
predicts its fraud costs will drop 20
percent for 1984 over 1983, after a
l,500 percent increase between 1981
and 1982.

Figures from Ranier Bank Card
Services in Seattle show about half
of all fraud occurs in three states:
New York, Florida and California.

Although consumer liability is
limited by federal law to $50 per
card, there is still inconvenience and
short-term credit problems to con-
tend with. .

llll||“""'

In Brief

Fernstrom reports the financial
service industry has moved ‘against
fraud and counterfeiting by rede-
signing the card printing process. It
makes fraud more difficult and more
expensive as more of the new cards
come out.

Stormie gets
Valentine

PITTSBURGH (UPI) -— Valen-
tine’s Day is a doubly special day for
sevcn—year-old Stormie Jones. ,

A year ago in Pittsburgh she
became the world’s first recipient of
a simultaneous heart and liver trans-
plant, and yesterday her mother,
Lois Jones, and Greg Brown were
married at the Victory Assembly of
God Church in Dallas, Tex.

On the anniversary of her surgery,
Stormie’s doctors said she is living
the life of a normal seven-year-old.

Stormie was born with a genetic
disorder that allowed her blood cho-
lesterol to build to levels six times
higher than normal. She would need
a new liver, which clears cholesterol
from the blood, as well as a new
heart.

She received both in surgery at
Pittsburgh's Presbyterian-
University Hospital one year ago
today.

Though Stormie's body appar-
ently has accepted the two new

organs, she must still take anti-
rejection medication twice daily and
stay on a low-cholesterol diet.

Hotel fire claims
23

MANILA, Philippines (UPI) -
Scattered flames and dense smoke
hampered efforts to search the upper
floors of a Philippine hotel where at
least 23 people were killed in a dev-
astating fire.

Five Americans were among the
dead in the blaze at the Regent of
Manila Hotel.

Manila’s fire chief said the death
toll could climb after the top four
floors of the nine-story luxury hotel
have been searched. One report said
more than 100 people are still
missing.

Hotel employees and witnesses
said the blaze broke out on the
second floor of the building early

Wednesday following an explosion
and a power failure.

They said phone lines also went
dead and no general alarm was
sounded.

Owners of the hotel said 288 peo-
ple were registered as guests at the
time of the fire. The owners are not
commenting on what caused the
fatal blaze.

Police said all indications are that
the fire was set by arsonists.

dary school students need to
concentrate more on the math and
science areas, and prepare them-
selves better for the college
curriculum.

He supported Bennett in his
insistence that higher education
must strive for a better quality
standard and said, “We have already
made steps to insure that we will
continue to offer quality education
in the future.”

When asked about any changes
that might come about through the
appointment of Bennett, Posvar
said that he couldn’t see any drastic
changes coming in the future. “This
administration sees a very limited
and passive role for the Department
of Education,” said‘»Posvar. He com-
mented that all that Bennett suggests
will not necessarily become fact.

The Reagan administration has
proposed in its new budget plan that
cuts be made in the amount of fed-
eral aid given to students. The new
plan calls for those students whose
parents have an income over $32,500
to be cut from eligibility for federal
aid. Also, those whose parents make
over $25,000 will be ineligible for
work-study programs, and no stu-
dent will be able to request more
than $4,000 in federal aid.

“What is the final outcome may be
different from what was proposed,”
Posvar stated. “The higher educa-
tion community has restored cuts in
aid over the last several years. We
certainly feel that we will be able to
work out a plan in this case also.”

What, me worry?

CRAZY FROM THE HEAT
David Lee Roth ‘
Warner Brothers

With the multi-platinum suc-
cesses of Van Halen tucked
gleefully under his belt, the
inimitable David Lee Roth has
found it fitting to serve up one
of the most superfluous records
to hit the shelves this year. Crazy
From The Heat contains four
tracks that were selected for no
other reason than the fact that
Dave has always liked them. His
childlike passion for the oldie
material saves this debut ep
from ending up a vinyl Frisbee.

Competently produced by
VH's Ted Templeman’ (with
major musical contributions by
Edgar Winter), the record takes
itself about as seriously as we
take Dave (good fun, but let's
not forget the profit factor).

”California Girls," though
embarrassingly similar in treat-

ONE CLEAR MOMENT
Linda Thompson
Warner Bros.

Linda Thompson's first solo
album after her 10-year—mar-
riage and musical partnership
with her husband Richard starts
out assuredly enough with

"Can't Stop the Girl.” With .

martial drumming and a Scot-
tish melody just begging ‘for
bagpipes, it seems she's hung on
to the most commendable qual-
ity of her work with her hus-
band — restating English folk
music with enough passion and
“immediacy to transcend the role
of archivist.

   

CHINESE FILM FESTIVAL

-B-ELINDA THOMPSON? — — —— — — — — — —— - —

ment to the original, is playfully
accented with Roth's trademark
hedonistic yelps. The cover of
the Lovin’ Spoonful’s "Coconut
Grove” grooves with soft
steamy vocals and an ethereal
texture, while ”Iust A Gigolo/I
Ain't Got Nobody” sounds like a
show tune sung by a demented
Sinatra with a chest cold. Its
brassy finale could turn Vegas
on its ear. The piece de resist-
ance — the booming horns and
unbridled vocals of ”Easy
Street” as we experience flirta-
tious cabaret Dave in all his
vamping glory.

If you appreciate the image
you'll appreciate the record and
if not, you can at least marvel at
the beautiful cover photo of a
sassy Dave wading in the eme-
rald green waters off The Sey-
chelles. We should all be so
brazen.

JEFFREY SEWALD

DAVID LEE ROTH

Together, they created a
seven—record body of work that
was modern and evolved, yet
never lost the rich tradition that
was its backbone. Unfortu-
nately, this“ record does not
maintain the hardy integrity of
its opener.

The rest of the album is
marred by overly prettied
arrangements, overbearing
churchy embellishments and
the stylistic diversity character-
istic of first solo outings, touch-
ing all the bases with a kind of
hit-or—miss outcome.

Two notable exceptions are
placed back to back, ending side
one and opening side two. The
haunting rendition of Ravel’s

//:2:

7%; av

"Les Trois Beaux Oiseaux de
Paradis” is a triumph of quie-

. tude. The Kate Bush-like ”Take

Me to the Subway” puts hide-
ous laughter, incomprehensible
murmuring and Middle Eastern
chanting over ‘layers of syn-
thetic percussion and keyboards
— bizarre and memorable.

It's easy to fawn over a crea-
tion sprung from personal
tragedy when the emotion is so
palpably authentic, but divorces
and solo albums happen every
day. Not to diminish Thomp-
son's tribulations, but her effort
must be assessed more coolly,
knowing the heights she rose to
with her husband.

Compared to the lean, sinewy
guitar work of her ex-spouse,
the instrumentation on this
record is flabby and anony-
mous. Her abilities peek
through this cloudy mess from
time to time with brilliant assu-
rance. If Linda Thompson can
hone her extraordinary powers
of composing and singing and

' jettison the safety net format of

"the new solo artist," her integ-
rity will carry her. The next
record could be the one.

WHO'S LAST
The Who
MCA

Culled from the band's 1982
farewell world tour, Who's Last is
tired — from its unimaginative
cover to the photo of the band
on the back showing Pete
Townshend and bassist John
Entwhistle looking like unfor-
tunate survivors of a meltdown
at Madame Tousseau's. The
weariness extends to every
vinyl point in between.

Although Townshend is gen-
erally as sharp as a knife, the
rest of the band is merely com-
petent and sounds strangely

The bands earliest material

seems to have held up best. Side
one’s ”My Generation,” ”Sub—
stitute” and ”I Can't Explain"
are the only songs (outside of
”Long Live Rock,”where
Townshend delivers a funky
break from the drollery) that
generate any enthusiasm from
the band or excitement in the
listener.

To include yet another ver-
sion of ”Won’t Get Fooled
Again,” ”Behind Blue Eyes” and
”Baba O’Riley” is worse than
redundant; it's a bit of a dis-

a sadder commentary on the

It's no mystery why this

Pittsburgh, PA — sixteen
new wheelchair accessible
paratransit vehicles will soon
be placed into service by two
local paratransit operators,
marking another first for
Allegheny County in improv-
ing transportation accessibility
for handicapped persons.

Custom build by Creative
Industries of Detroit, the
Chrysler vehicles were pur-
chased on a low bid of $36,000
each through a Federal Urban
Mass Transportation Admin-
istration (UMTA) demonstra-
tion grant.

”Eight vehicles each will be
owned and operated by the
Yellow Cab and Colonial Cab
Companies, making this area
the first in the nation to have
this type of wheelchair accessi-
ble vehicle in regular pas-
senger service," said PAT
Executive Director William W.
Millar.

”We are deeply grateful to
UMTA for enabling the
further expansion of transpor-
tation services for handicapped
persons throughout Allegheny
County."

Unlike paratransit vans that
are equipped with wheelchair

lifts, access onto the Chrysler

VEHICLES DEBUT

vehicles is coordinated
through ramps stored under
‘the passenger floor and oper-
ated manually by the vehicle
operator.

Each vehicle will accommo-
date a maximum of five pas-
sengers and up to two
wheelchairs.

The new accessible vehicles
will complement the two local
cab carriers fleet of wheelchair
accessible vans currently used
for ACCESS and other
services.

ACCESS Transportation
Systems, lnc., under contract
with PAT, provides door-to-
door service for elderly and
handicapped persons through
privately owned transporta-
tion carriers and non-profit
community agencies.

The system was developed
initially under a demonstration
grant. from UMTA and today
continues to serve as a model
for other transit agencies.

ACCESS currently provides
more than 70,000 trips each
month, approximately 20,000
of which serve wheelchair
users.

COUNSELING

Sometimes counseling is simply
sharing your thoughts and feel-
ings in confidence with a counse-
lor who is objective and also a
good listener. This is often helpful
when you have a decision to make.

Sometimes counseling provides
you with, or directs you to, certain
types of information and then
helps you to understand that
information.

At other times counseling may
help you to change your feelings
about yourself or others, or help
you to change some of your
behavior.

_ 

Generally people come for
counseling because they want to
feel better about themselves
andlor others. Some of the spe-
cific reasons for which they come
include a desire to: increase self-
confidence, overcome loneliness,
depression and shyness, cope with
stress, and to become more
assertive.

THE COUNSELING AND STU-
DENT DEVELOPMENT
CENTER

The psychologists and counse-
lors of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Counseling and Student

Penn «AAA Motorist.

It's time to get ready to go in the
snow! Winter is here, like it or not,
and since none of us can control
the weather, let's start with some-
thing that you can control——your
car.

ELECTRICAL
SYSTEM

Number one item on your
checklist should be the electrical
system. Examine the battery's
ability to hold a charge; weak bat-
teries should be re-charged or
replaced. if the battery isn't per-
manently sealed, check the fluid
level and, where necessary, top it
up. Be sure battery posts and
cables are clean and tight, and
have the voltage regulator

checked.
EXTERIOR LIGHTS

All exterior lights should be
fully operational. Not only do you
have to see out, other drivers have
to be able to spot you.

IGNITION WIRES

Ignition wires, the distributor
and spark plugs all need to be
checked, so a Fall engine tune-up
is an excellent idea.

RADIATOR

The rediator and hoses should
be examined for leaks and cracks.
If you can't remember when the
system was last flushed out and
refilled, do so now. Also, test your
heater and defroster since their
proper operation contributes to
your visibility.

BRAKES

In winter driving, good brakes
are all-important, so make sure
brake shoes, pads, and the entire

system (including fluid levels) are .

as they should be.

Safe Winter Driving

TIRES

Have you examined your tires

for tread wear lately? Snow tires
are good common sense on the
drive wheels, and an even better
idea if you can have them on all
four. chains provide the best trac-
tion in severe conditions,
although it's important to
remember they will limit the max-
imum speed you can travel on the
open highway. Although front-
wheel drive cars do enjoy superior
traction, snow tires will improve

that considerably, and when-

chains are necessary they should
be mounted on all four wheels.

EXHAUST SYSTEM

Have the exhaust system
checked for leaks. Make it a habit
to always crack the window or
open a_ fresh air vent when the
heater's running. When parked
near a snow drift, always be sure
the tailpipe is clear of
obstructions.

WINDSHIELD WIPERS

Along thses same lines, wind-
sield wipers and blades need to be
checked, and the washer reservoir
bottle needs to be topped up with a
good anti-freeze solvent solution.

BE PREPARED

Admittedly, it's nearly imposss-
ible to anticipate every emer-
gency, but if you carry the
following items in your car, you'll
be prepared:

—Tire chains

—Small snow shovel
—Traction mats

—Small bag of sand, salt, or kitty
litter

—~lce scraper or snow brush
—Battery booster cables
—Warning flares
-—Flashlight A

—Cloth or paper towels
——Blanket and First Aid Kit
—Extra clothing

GETTING STARTED

Now that the car is checked out
and ready, we. get to the harder
stuff —- getting started. Drive the
car forward and backward in the
parking space to clear a path for
the wheels for several feet. Heavy
snow may required some shovel-
ing. Point your wheels straight,
and with a gentle pressure on the
gas pedal, try to ease out of your
parking space gently. DO NOT
SPIN YOUR WHEELS, you'll only
dig yourself deeper. If you still
can't get out, spread some sand,
salt or kitty litter for more tractio.
If that won't work, lay out the
traction mats in front of each

wheel. If you're still stuck, you-

may need pushing help, but don't
let your helpers stand directly
behind the wheels— they may be
injured by objects thrown by the
wheels as they spin.

Once you're underway,
remember that a light touch on
the gas and brakes is the best way
to retain traction and avoid skids.
When the wheels start to spin,
ease up on the gas until traction
returns. Try to maintain your for-
ward momentum. As you come to
a hill, see how other cars are doing
ahead of you, and allow enough
following distance so you won't
have to slow down or stop. At the
crest of ahell, reduce speed and
proceed downhill as sowly as pos-
sible. Try to minimize the use of
the brakes, but where necessary,
use a slow and gentle touch on the
brakes to avoid locking the wheels
and skidding. Try to maintain a
generous amount of stopping dis-
tance ahead of you.

STEERING’ AND
SKIDDING

‘ ‘Just as your gas and brake
pedals require and*easy touch, so
too does your steering wheel. You

can avoid many skids by anticipat-

ing lane changes, curves and turns
well in advance, by gradually
slowing your speed, and by using
smooth and precise steering
movements.

Now let's suppose you're doing
your very best, but you find your-

self skidding anyway (it happens
to the very best drivers). First of
all, don't panic, don't jam on the
brakes, and don't jerk on the
steering wheel; instead, disengage
the driving force to the drive
wheels. Wiht a manual trasmision
this is easy: simply de-clutch. With
an automatic transmission, it's a
little trickier, you have to shift to
NEUTRAL. This requires prac-
tice, since you have to be certain
of finding NEUTRAL imme-
diately. Practice this while the car
is safely parked. if you don't there
is the very great danger you may
over-shift into REVERSE. Once
the drive force is dis-engaged, you
can regain control ith smooth and
precise steering movements.

In most cases, you'll experience
the kind of skid in which the rear
wheels "breakaway" from the
direction in which the front
wheels are pointing. Dis-engage
the driving force from the drive
wheels. Steer in the direction you
want the front of the "car to go. As
the rear wheels begin to respond,
"countersteer"”'the other way, so
your rear wheels wind up on the
same side of the road as your front
wheels. Remember to keep those
steering movements gentle! If you
over-correct, a rear-wheel drive
car may start to skid the other
way. With the car now back under
control, reengage the drive force ,
(engage the clutch or shift back to
DRIVE), and gently bring the car
back up into a safe speed.

Front, wheel skids are less com-
mon, but they are easier to deal
with since there's no danger of
"over—corrrection". Disengage the
driving force from the drive
wheels. Unless you are skidding
on a very sharp curve or in a
crowded area, DO NOT move the
steering wheel. Since the front
wheels are skidding sideways,
they're automatically exerting a
certain amount of braking force. If
you "unwind" the steering wheel,

Commuter /lssocioﬂon

p}igé"°I

you will regain control of the car
sooner, but you will also find
yourself travelling faster. So only
"unwind" the steering wheel
where sharp curves, and limited
space exist. Once traction is
regained, steer the car gently in
the direction you want to go.
Then re-engage the drive force‘
and gently bring the car back up to
a safe speed.

And this brings us to the matter
of just what is a "safe speed".
Speed limits are posted with the
understanding that these are the
fastest speeds you can travel
when all conditions are at their
best, and that lets us out. Just
because the sign says 55 MPH
doesn't mean you should try to go
that fast.

STOPPING

Stopping in the winter means
longer seeing, following and stop-
ping distances...much longer. Try
to focus your attention as far
ahead as possible (at least 12
seconds). Be alert to temperature
changes and localized hazards
such as shaded spots, bridges,
overpasses and intersection.
Heavy traffic areas may have road
surfces polished to glare ice condi-
tion, and meltwater runoff can
further aggravate the situation by
"lubricating" an already icy
surface.

The best way to slow the car is
to disengage the drive force to the

"drive wheels (Practicel, Practice!),

and then "pump" the brakes. This
is done by applying the pedal fairly
hard, until the wheels just begin
to lock up, and then release them
until the wheels just begin to roll
freely again. By "pumping the
brakes" repeatedly in this way,
you will achieve the best combina-
tion of braking effort and steering
control. A’

You may find yourself sitting in a darkened cinema

\.

by Carrie Stetler

During the Talking Heads’ last
tour, David Byrne wore a gargantuan
suit and danced like a nerd possessed.
The rest of the band made a lot of
weird faces, and behind them a back-
drop flashed words like ”dustballs,”
”public library” and ”onions.” Direc-
tor Jonathan (Melvin and Howard)

ality."

performance art. The potential
audience, catching glimpses of the
results on MTV, might be tempted to
ask, ”What does it all mean, anyway?"

Of course, the title of the movie is
Stop Making Sense, and as cerebral as
the Heads’ reputation might be,
understanding them has never had

. much to do with enjoying them.

On vinyl, the band.’s odd poly-
rhythms and even odder lyrics often
create a sense of an impending ner-

vous breakdown. You might think,
then, that sitting through a Talking
Heads concert film would be a tense
affair, but even during its more eerie
moments (which are few), Stop Making
Sense is filled with humor and unex-
pected joy.

The first half of the movie is sur-
prisingly relaxed, despite David
Byrne’s solo opening performance
onstage: an acoustic version of ”Psy-
cho Killer.” (It sounds disconcerting,
but it's not.) He is soon joined by a
sheepish Tina Weymouth as the-rest
of the band emerges, until the entire

TALKING HEADS

ensemble (including back-up singers
Volume, Bernie Worrell and Steve
Scales) is on screen. Tina Weymouth
gradually loses her sheepish grin as
the band warms up, and soon they're
all looking pretty static, jogging in
unison or dancing and mugging with
each other as they play.

Through Demme’s simple and inti-
mate camera’ work (He could have
sprung an odd—angle, quicksilver
editing job here, but he had the wis-
dom not to.), each of the players is
revealed as a separate and intriguing
personality. Demme also captures

the ”oneness” of the band so that the
film is never unbalanced.

In other words, you never feel like
looking at the drummer when the
camera is somewhere else. Not only
does the movie seem perfectly bal-
anced, but the concert performance
itself —— considering the amount of
choreography that must have gone
into it — seems spontaneous.

Without appearing to hog
Demme’s spotlight, David Byrne is
the obvious focal point of Stop Making
Sense. His theatricality has an even
wider range than mere video can sug-
gest; he moves from light sarcasm to
black comedy merely by slicking his
hair back or donning a pair of horn-'
rimmed glasses. During ”Naive Mel-
ody" he performs a strangely graceful
dance, using a lamp as his partner; it
is one of the film's best moments.

There is‘ no boring ”behind the
scenes" look at the band in Stop Making
Sense, and no prolonged shots of
audience reaction, either. The film
focuses strictly on the band's ‘perfor-
mance which, while happily lacking in
forced banter (The Talking Heads are
above shouting, ”It’s great to be in
Cleveland tonight!”) doesn't seem
self-absorbed, either.

This is simply a good movie, cen-
tered around a fine concert, and it
doesn't take a Talking Heads’ fan to
appreciate its warmth and‘ refreshing
lack of “sense.” Who needs to think
when your feet just go?

 

The best-laid plans

by Leslie M. Bennett

There is something intimidating
about finding a valid way of
approaching a literary work whose
themes seek to expose our faults and
failures as well as our dreams and
schemes for improvement.

That feeling is sure to be shared
with The Famous Rider and We're
Entertainment's current production
of Of Mice And Men by Pulitzer and
Nobel Prize winner, John Steinbeck.
Steinbeck’s text, originally a novel

 written with the theater in mind, is a

challenging one because it demands
much, not only from those portray-
ing its characters, but also from its
audience.

Set in the height of the Great
Depression, the play presents a series
of conflicts and confrontations
among a group of California ranch
hands, particularly between George
Milton (Fred Donatelli) and Lennie
Small (Torn Revilla). George is a
high-strung, verbal character who

I makes up in cunning what he lacks in

courage. Lennie is his loyal compan-
ion — a big and powerful oaf whose
inferior capacity for intelligence can
almost be overlooked given his huge
capacity for hard work and
sensitivity.

Aside from trying to resolve the
everyday trials of getting along in
this world full of people, the play also
portrays the chilling’ loneliness that

keeps men apart. ‘

”Guys like us that work on ranches
is the loneliest guys in the world,”
says George. ”They ain't got no fam-
ily. They don't belong no place.”

In order to distinguish themselves
from the rest, George and Lennie
envision owning a little place where
George can ”live off the fat o’ the
land” and Lennie can tend rabbits like
the ones he saw at the Sacramento
fair.

The Famous Rider's production,
directed by Richard P. Willing, suc-
ceeds in capturing Steinbeck’s pro-
vocativeness, in spite of certain
technical and logistical problems.

Tom Revilla, who is finishing a
master's degree in theater at Pitt,
positively becomes the role of Lennie,
with his perfectly dull-witted but
well-intended speech and gestures.
Fred Donatelli, ending a two—year
absence from acting, exhibits a high-
pitched performance as George, giv-
ing the character a bit more strength
and sympathy than the play may give

. in a straight reading.

The sets are well-conceived,
thanks to Richard Willing, who
designed them, and scenic artist
Robert C.T. Steele. The bunkhouse
and barn scenes are particularly
realistic.

Any shortcomings in the produc-
tion come in the staging itself. Some
of -the action takes place on the stage

floor making it impossible to see from

David Early and Mike Freeman star in Of Mice and Men.

any seat beyond the second row.
That, along with an awkward stage
entrance where the audience sees the
actor before he actually appears in
the scene, serves only to distract
from the play.

The eight members of the support-
ing cast all perform admirably, with
some special applause going to David
Early, who accepted the role of
Crooks on short notice.

Another particularly crucial scene
takes place in Crooks’ room, on a
night when all the others go carous-
ing and four apparent misfits gather

.-.4-......................,.,‘_,‘,

to talk. Each of the characters suffers
from his own sort of isolation: a wife
who has no one to talk to, a handi-
capped old man looking for a way to
contribute, Lenny, whose sole occu-
pation is his dream, and the proud
and intelligent Crooks, who is
excluded from the bunkhouse
because he's black. It is he who has
the most articulate diagnosis: ”A guy
gets too lonely, he gets sick.” he says.

By the last shattering scene, where
the problem of Lennie’s isolation is
finally and painfully resolved, no one
can avoid feelings of sorrow, guilt
and love.‘

Panthers hold off(lConn, win 5th in a row

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

St. John’s red-splashed uniforms
add color to a happening later today
in Jamaica, N.Y., where the nation’s
No. 1 basketball team just might
carry out a post-St. Valentine‘s Day
Massacre.

If the Redmen (20-1, ll-0) want
to, the Panthers stand to be
terrorized.

The last time that happened (Jan.
14), St. John’s toted away an 87-56
victory, fracturing Pitt under the
largest hail of machine-gunnery in
19 years of Fitzgerald play.

At the time, head coach Roy
Chipman carried away his head in
his hands. Lately, he’s winning much
more appreciation, winning five in a
row after Wednesday night’s 78-71
lock on Connecticut. Which guaran-
tees nothing as the Panthers recon-
cile with a team whose 15-game
winning streak bests all Division I
schools.

“If we don’t win tonight,” Chip-
man said two nights ago after Pitt
ascended to 15-7, 6-5, “with St.
J ohn’s and Georgetown ahead, you
go out with your rear end in your
hands. You don’t know what to
expect. But now we go against those
two schools and play. See what

happens.”

The Panthers can expect a repeat
of Jan. 14 with Syracuse's Chris
Mullin (second in league overall
scoring, 18.5), Walter Berry (second
leading rebounder, 9.5) and Bill
Wennington (third in ﬁeld percen-
tage, 59.8). Given their last game,
they could have envisioned another
loss to UConn. Last month's 76-74
loss to the Huskies came after Pitt
dropped a 15-point lead.

Earl Kelley, the culprit then,
played the villain again. His three
straight jumpers and two free throws
in between put UConn ahead 49-47
with 13:09 left. He and his 26 points
had lifted UConn from a 10-point
deficit earlier.

Kelley’s 40 minutes on the ﬂoor,
though, couldn’t pull the Huskies
any further — that, and a box-and-
one defense that effectively
grounded him.

“It took them out of their game,”
said guard Joey David, assigned to
Kelley while the other four played
zone. “I don’t know how Demetreus
feels, but if you’re playing the box-
and-one, you have four guys behind
you, four guys supporting you.”

Also, at guard, Demetreus Gore

did to UConn what Kelley tempo- .

rarily accomplished against the Pan-
thers. The freshman from Detroit
played his finest college game, scor-
ing 23 points, coupling well with
another freshman Charles Smith (18

Pitt women’s team
destroys Seton Hall

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s basketball team
moved into solid control of fourth
place Wednesday night with a 76-50
romp over visiting Seton Hall.

Although Coach Judy Saurer
thought her squad could have
played better, the Lady Panthers
had little trouble with the Bucettes.
“We didn’t look like we were in a
flow out there,” said Saurer. “We’re
going to have to play a lot better if
we are going to beat Boston
College.”

Saurer was thinking of Saturday
afternoon’s confrontation with Bos-
ton College at the field house. The
Eagles are riding high off a 65-56
victory over Big East frontrunner
Villanova on Wednesday night, and
will be looking to avenge the one-
point loss they suffered at the hands
of Pitt Jan. 16.

Boston College is a big team that
is led by two newcomers. Freshman
guard Ann O’Day leads the Eagles in
scoring at a 12.3 clip, while junior
Marie Grant, a transfer from Boston
University, is second at 11.9 ppg.

The Eagles boast 6-2 Biz
Houghton and 6-0 Sally Madeira
along with Grant on the front line,

Press Box

Jorge Sanchez, Matt Peters and Mark Klaf-
ter stand high in the ranks of Eastern

which makes the play of Pitt center
Jenny Tyner all the more important.

Tyner will have to be a force in the
middle if the Lady Panthers are
going to control the Boston College
front line. “We are really going to
need her to play well,” said Saurer of
Tyner. “We’ll have to get the ball to
her.”

While Tyner’s play may have the
biggest impact, Pitt will also need
Jennifer Bruce and Ellen Gilhooley
to keep the play consistent. The two
senior forwards combined for 37
points and 17 rebounds against
Seton Hall, but they will need to
team with Tyner to handle the BC

frontline. .

Pitt‘s guards took a step in the
right direction against Seton Hall.
Kim Tirik and Lisa Fubio combined
for 24 points and 10 assists, while
limiting their combined turnovers to
seven. In addition, the team
decreased the turnover count from
29, against Duquesne last Saturday,
to only 17 against Seton Hall.
Seventeen is still a high number, but
it is explained by the fact that the
entire team, including the less expe-
rienced players, saw action.

Pitt travels to St. John’s next
Wednesday, then ends the regular
season at Connecticut on Feb. 23.

behind by two.

“I’m a lot more comfortable out
there now than I have been,” said
Gore, who made 9 of 17. “Charles
helped get me the ball and, yeah,
we’re starting to feel better
together.”

“Lethargic” sums up Chipman’s
prognosis of the first half. Ahead by
10 with 5:38 before the half, the
Panthers lost track of their leash on

Kelley as he pumped in six points to
cut it to 36-34 at :10, before counter-
part Curtis Aiken upped the inter-
mission score with two free throws.

“Keith [Armstrong], Chip [Wat-
kins] and Charles already had two

fouls,” Chipman recounted. “So we

had four subs in the game and we
wanted to stay out of foul trouble.
But we missed free throws, threw
some balls away."

It wasn’t until Chipman opted for
the box-and-one that the Panthers
responded.

“We had to go to that because .
Earl is a good shooter and we felt he
could knock us out down the stretch
if he got open,” Armstrong said.

‘‘There’s no way to stop him,”
Darryl Shepherd added. “We knew
that before the game. We tried the
box and he still put the ball in the
basket. He’s impossible to stop.”

Pitt gymnastids super trio leading East

ByJace Palmer
ThePlttNews

The men gymnasts will be the
home team for the first time in 1985
as Eastern Michigan travels to Fitz-
gerald Field House tomorrow at 2
p.m. The Panthers are heavily
favored considering the emphasis
the two schools give to their
program. .

“They [Eastern Michigan] don't
usually build up their gymnastic
team as they do other sports,” said
junior Marty Comini. “I think we
have a better quality team.”

Pitt head coach Frank D’Amico is
hoping to reach the 270-point mark
for the first time this season. “East-
ern Michigan is not a predominantly
‘young team,” he commented.
‘“They’ll probably score/around the
230 range.”

Last week’s meet at Indiana State
was a turning point in the season,
clearly showing Pitt's strength as
every gymnast contributed to the
scoring. One key link in the Pitt
attack has been the improvement of
sophomore Ben Rovee. Rovee has
made large contributions as he has
competed well all season.

“I think I’m making gradual
improvements as the season pro-
gresses," Rovee stated. “Last week-
end I had my best score ever in floor
exercise. I hope I do good on rings
this week because that’s my strong
point." i

He added that if he does hit on the
rings, he expects around a nine in
scoring.

For the second straight week, the
Panthers will be without sophomore
Kevin Garren, who is out temporar-
ily with a shoulder problem. How-
ever, this should not be as big a
factor as his absence was last week
due to the difference in competition.

“It will be nice to get in a couple of
nice scores in the next two weeks,”
D’Amico said. “The following week,
we’ll travel to Slippery Rock and we
should receive good scores because
we’ll have the same set of judges.”

Pitt’s weakest point as of late has
been the pommel horse, an event
they’ve been concentrating on all
season. Last week’s showing pro-
duced a 43.9 —~ their best yet, but
D’Amico doesn’t want to stop there.

“Pommel horse will again be a key
event on Saturday because we want
to keep increasing that score,” he
said. “As soon as we break the 44
barrier, we’ll try to increase that,
too.”

D’Amico said that the team is
really coming around on rings and
parallel bars, and expects to keep a
regular 46 team score in vaulting.

In many sports, competing
against a weaker squad can often
lead to drastic outcomes, but senior
captain Ed Miller doesn’t feel this
will be the case on Saturday.

“I never really anticipate meets
like I used to. I just take them as they
come,” he said. “Performing well in
a low-pressure meet is pretty easy
because our routines should go like

they do in practice."

As the season hits the halfway
point, several Panthers will be look-
ing to move ahead of the competi-
tion in the Eastern standings.
Freshman Jorge Sanchez, along
with past All-East performers Mark
Klafter and Matt Peters. are defi-

nitely in contention. All three are
among the leaders at the present
time.

“I really don’t look at the statistics
this early,” said Klafter. “I usually
take the season as a whole. Toward
the end is where the true performers
come through. You can’t afford to

let up now." V

Pitt has had a reputation for peak-
ing at the end of the season, some-
thing they’ll need to do against
upcoming powers Ohio State (No. 2)
and Penn State(No. 1). For now, the

Women’s swim team sets goals

By Mary Dalgle
The Pitt News

You may have seen the combina-
tion of. numbers before - 9-3-10 -
it’s the slogan that has been on the
back of the Pitt women’s swim
team’s T-shirts all year.

So what is the significance of 9-3-
10‘? According to Coach David Belo-
wich, it’s the team’s one form of
jargon, a private representation of
their goals for the season. The nine
stands for a 9-0 record, the three
stands for the team’s third Big East
Championship title and the 10
stands for the team’s goal to__, be
ranked in the Top 10 nationally by
the end of the season.

“We knew that we would have a
strong team this year. 9-3-10 became
our own slogan; we knew what it
meant, but it wasn‘t something that
everyone else would know. It

became the goal embraced by the
team,” Belowich said.

The swimmers will have the
opportunity to fulfill at least part of
their slogan in their final dual meet
of the season when they face a tough
Princeton team this Saturday at l
p.m. at Trees Pool.

The team has had a two-week
break since its last meet. That was
enough time to get rid of the flu that
had plagued the team for the second
half of the season.

“I have a good feeling on how
we'll swim. Everyone is healthy and
we don’t have any injuries. I can
recall the meet against WVU, when
we had three people out with
temperatures of 103 degrees. We’ve
had to overcome a lot of adversity. I
think that kind of adversity has been
good; it’s made us stronger,” Belo-
wich commented.

According to Belowich, his team,
which lost to Princeton by four
points last season (72-68), is ready
both physically and mentally totake

on the Ivy League school. The rest,
he said, is up to Princeton.

“We’re in the position to be ready
to win,” he said. “Whether we win or
not is no longer important, as long
as we do our best. We can’t control
what Princeton does, so we’ll just
give it our best shot.”

Belowich is planning to go with
the regular lineup for the meet,
although he said that there may be a
few surprises. “I don’t think we’re
going to have to make any major
changes. We don’t need to pull any
tricks either,” he said.

There is one “surprise” planned
for those on hand for the beginning
of the meet. Sophomore Susan
Hickman will be back by popular
demand to sing the national anthem.
Hickman made her debut last season
for the Big East Championship.

Belowich is hoping for a lot of
crowd support to help the Lady
Panthers claim their first undefeated
season since 1976.

“This is it. W,e’ve set our goals and
have been counting all season. Now
we have one,” Belowich said. “Prin-
ceton’s a tough team. If we are to
have an undefeated season, it’ll only
seem right if it’s against good
competition.”

Pitt keeps

streak alive

continued from page ﬁfteen
Chipman stops diplomatically
short of admitting that the box-and-
one, a first in his five years here, will
be heaved at Mullin.
“He’s so darn smart. We have to
be ready for anything,” he said.
Anything, including a quick end-
ing to a tidy string of wins.
 

“I’ve got to come back in and
start working on my outside
shot. "

—— Chip Watkins

Off the Boards: The Panthers
pinned 44 percent of their field
goals, UConn with 42 percent. Each
team saw three of its players foul out
— including Armstrong, for the
second straight game.

Mullin is Big East Player of the
Week for the third time this season,
the 6-6 Brooklynite having scored 43
points in come-from-behind efforts
against Seton Hall and Villanova.

Only Kelley (92.7) is ahead of
Mullin (86.2) in conference free
throw percentage.

Forward Chip Watkins scored 10s
in points and rebounds in one of his
best performances to date. After two
fouls 3:19 into the game, he topped
the halftime leader board with 10
points.

Four-of-nine from the field, Wat-
kins wasn‘t pleased. “I’ve got to
come back in and start working on
my outside shot. When I start going
outside, I go back to my old ways.
I’m not_ concentrating.”

The Big East Championship series
March 6-9 is a complete sellout. All
l9,59l Madison Square Garden
seats have been eaten up through
mail orders and by the nine member
schools.

With the Panthers now in fifth
place and Villanova (7-5) in fourth,
Pitt would again meet the Wildcats
if first-round action began tonight.

Runners up against veterans at meet

By Rich McKenzie
The Pitt News

This weekend the members of
Pitt’s men’s track team face their
stiffest challenge of the year as they
travelto Syracuse for the Big East
Indoor Track and Field Champion-
ships. The Panthers will be trying to
improve on last year’s third-place
finish behind Seton Hall and Villa-
nova. This will be a difficult task to
accomplish, however, as the Pan-
thers are a very young squad, taking
only onejunior and one senior to the
meet.

“This is a very important meet for
us; it’s our conference champion-
ships, and we would like to do well,"
said Coach John Vasvary.

To do well, the Panthers will have
to perform better than some of the
finest runners in the country. There
will be eight or nine Olympians from
the U.S. and around the world com-
peting in the meet.

Pitt must also face some of the
best teams in the country.

“As far as track goes, the Big East
is analogous to basketball in that it is
one of the best, if not the best track
conference in the nation. As far as
the favorites,” Vasvary continued,
“going in, Villanova, Georgetown

open 24 hours
COME IN AND

and Seton Hall would have to be the
favorites, mainly because of their
experience. They all are experienced
teams who have fine runners. St.
John’s, Connecticut and Syracuse
will score well because they all have
excellent field teams.”

The scoring system that will be
used in the meet will be a six-place
system, with first place in each event
scoring 10, followed by 8-6-4-2-l,
for places second through sixth,
respectively.

Those athletes who Vasvary con-
sidered the favorites in their given
events include Martin Booker of Vil-
lanova in the 55-meter hurdles and
the 300-meter dash, Andrew Daw-
man of Seton Hall in the 400-meter
run, and Tracey Biskin, also of
Seton Hall, in the 500-meter run.
Booker has one of the fastest
recorded times in the East this sea-
son for the 55-meter hurdles.

Favored in the 1,000 is Miles Irish
of Georgetown, as he has run one of
the fastest times in the nation. Other
favorites include fellow Hoyas in the
mile, Kevin King in the 3,000, Frank
McConvill, and the Hoya two-mile
relay team. In other team events —
the distance medley and the mile
relay — Villanova has a strong
chance to win.

In the field events, the favorites
are Ray Humphrey of Georgetown
in the triplejump and the longjump

 

and Mark Gooden of Syracuse in
the high jump. Syracuse’s Eric
Decker and defending champion
Paul Ursillo are favored to win the
shot put and pole vault, respectively.
The probable winner of the 35-lb.
weight event is Jim Kenney of
Connecticut.

With the experience and talent
that the championships promise, the
young Pitt squad’s chances for vic-
tory would seem to be slim.

“There are quality athletes com-
peting and the competition is going
to be really tough, but we will line up
and give it our best shot, and when
you do that anything can happen,”
Vasvary commented. . '-

Championship Notes: The cham-
pionships will take place in two
separate locations on separate days.
On the first day, the competition will
take place at Manly Field House on
the Syracuse campus and the second
day at the Carrier Dome.

The Panthers are still recovering
from a bout with the ﬂu that has hit
them particularly hard in the middle
distance - events. Vasvary said,
“Training-wise, we’re where we
would like to be at this stage of the
season, but I would like to have one
more meet or so to get everyone fully
recovered.”

Hockey team ‘hot,’ Wins again

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News
It was a cold night, even for

hockey. But 10 members of the Pitts-
burgh Hockey Club made the jour-

F ney to Meadville Wednesday night

CTCTOTOTOTQTQTQ

BEER BLAST

“BLACKJACK TOURNAMENTS”

to seek some hot action. The Pan-
thers are now 14-2-1 after defeating
Slippery Rock '13-3 on the Rockets’
home ice.

The Panthers took control early
in the game, scoring five goals in the
first period and leaving the Rockets
with only two. a

“Our game strategy was to get a

Gymnast trio

continued from page sixteen
Michigan and a possible shot at
national rankings.

Off the, Rings: The following Pitt
gymnasts hold these individual posi-
tions in the Eastern standings:

Matt Peters - tied for ﬁfth on
rings (9.32), tied for fourth on paral-
Iel bars (9.12), tied for first on high
bars (9.62) and third in all-around
competition (53.95).

Mark Klafter — second in floor
exercise (9.68) and tied for ninth on
the parallel bars (9.03).

Jorge Sanchez —~ fourth in floor
exercise (9.52) and tied for seventh
in vaulting.

  
   

  

  

 
       

lot of goals in the early going
because we didn’t have that many
players,” said co-captain Damon
Brown. “Overall, the defense played
really well. Slippery Rock was pretty
physical in front ofthe net, and that
just got me motivated.” Brown, a
defenseman, played offense for most
of the game and demonstrated his
adaptability with two goals and two
assists for the Panthers.

“We definitely played as a team.
Because we were Shorthanded we
knew if we skated with them, we
would tire out. So we passed them to
death,” said left wing Jim Owens Jr.
“Instead of skating the puck, it was
passed ahead to save energy. Every-
thing went our way. Well, almost
everything.”

Since Slippery Rock has an in-
door/ outdoor ice rink, the Panthers
were given a small space heater to
warm up the bench a little. Unfortu-
nately, defenseman John Pettit got
too close to the heater and his pants
were set aﬂame.

“We had to throw the water bot-
tles on the side of his pants to put out
the fire,” explained right wing Roger
Oldaker. “.lohn’s OK, but his pants
are all brown now.”

The Panthers continued to burn
up the ice by scoring eightadditional
goals in the secondand third peri-
ods. Hat tricks were recorded by
Bowers, Owens and Oldaker (4
goals).

“That’s the first time I ever scored
four goals,” said Oldaker. “Slippery

(Rock isn’t a bad team, but with us
just coming off from playing Ohio
University and Duquesne, we were
really skating fast and they weren't
fast enough to catch us.”

The Panthers’ next opponent is
Gannon, the only team the Pitt skat-
ers haven’t beat this season. The
Panthers were shut out by Gannon
in an early season game at the Civic
Center in Erie and the Pitt skaters
are out for revenge.

“We want Gannon more than we
wanted Duquesne,” said Bowers.
“The first time we played Duquesne,

we at least showed them that we _

could skate with them. But we
played terrible against Gannon and
we didn’t show them anything.”
The Panthers have been through a
lot since they last battled Gannon,
including beating Duquesne, the
No. 1 team in the division. The skat-
ers now have the confidence and the
momentum to ﬁnd the revenge that
they seek in this rematch.
“We‘rejust going to take the body
to them,”explained Brown. “We feel
that we’ll have an advantage on our
home ice.”
The game is set for Monday
night at Lakevue Ice Palace.
