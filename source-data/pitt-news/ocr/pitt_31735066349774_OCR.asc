For Damages

A former Pitt gymnast, paralyz-
ed by an accident in Trees Hall,
ﬁled suit yesterday demanding that
Pitt continue to cover his medical
expenses.

Thomas A. Cardamone, 24, of
Bethel Park, was a senior on
October 19, 1972, when he fell
while dismounting from rings
during gymnastics practice and
Cardamone has

since then.

A 50-page document estimating
damages to Cardamone and his
parents in excess of $7 million was
filed in Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court along with a request
for an injunction that would force
Pitt to pay for his medical
expenses.

According to Cardamone’s fath-
er, Pitt paid for eight months’
hospitalization for his son and
supplied the family with a nurse
eight hours a day when he returned
home.

Cardamone, who was resident
assistant and a cheerleader in
addition to being a member of the
gym team, went to the Harmarville
Rehabilitation Center in January.
His family was informed the
University would no longer cover
his expenses.

A University spokesman said Pitt
officials have never acknowledged
liability in the case, but refused
to comment further.

An attorney for the Cardamones
said Pitt was notified in September,
1974, that the family planned to
sue. The attorney said he was led
to believe at that time a settlement
could be reached without going to
court.

“We think Tom can still become
productive if given the proper
care,” Cardamone’s father said.

A conference between the family
and Pitt has been scheduled for
Friday afternoon before Common
Pleas Judge Marion Finkelhor.

The Committee on Student
Organizations (CS0) has ordered
the Commuter Association (CA) to
either hold another election of
officers or furnish proof that
alleged improprieties in the June 9
and 10 election did not occur.

Charges that voters in the CA
election were not required to
produce ID, the ballot was not a
secret one, election workers were
guilty of improper “recruiting” of
voters and that at least one voter
used an assumed name when
voting were discussed at a CSO
meeting Tuesday.

“We seriously question the
procedures employed in the CA
election,” CSO chairman Hank
Kearney said after Tuesday’s
meeting. ‘

“I was walking down the hall
(and the election worker)...asked
me to vote, saying he needed only
one more vote for 25," Kearney
said.

“I told him who I was and he
became very embarrassed.”

The CA had been under review
by the CS0 in March for alleged
violations of CS0 by-laws. It was

equipment used to make it and
conspiracy to make and distribute
an illegal substance in a nonjury
trial before Allegheny County
Criminal Division Senior Judge
Loran Lewis.

Allison, a teaching fellow in
Pitt’s chemistry department, was
returned to the Allegheny County
Jail to await sentencing. He could
receive a maximum 24-year sen-
tence, Lewis said.

Another Pitt student, Mary Jo
Belleza, who was living in Towers
at the time of the arrest, also was
charged in the incidents. Her trial
was postponed.

Chemicals and equipment capa-
ble of producing 100 pounds of
methaqualone, which has an
estimated street value of $15,000 a
pound, were seized in a garage at
the time of the arrest.

Allison, formerly a high school
teacher, was convicted three years
ago of making amphetamines in his
high school classroom. In 1973, he
was sentenced to Lewisburg
Federal Penitentiary for making
amphetamine sulfate (speed) in the
laboratory at Waynesburg Central
High School, where he taught
chemistry.

He was parolled after serving
eight months, of a 12-month
sentence.

Pitt Budget
Awaits State
House Vote

Pitt’s $60.4 million state budget
was approved by the State Senate
Tuesday and sent on to the House
for a vote.

The $60.4 million appropriation
is the figure used by the University
in computing its overall annual
budget, which precipitated a $70
per year undergraduate tuition
increase and budget cuts through-
out University departments.

Pitt’s initial request was for
$68.5 million, but Governor Shapp
recommended $59.9 million.

The Senate also approved a $4.5
million grant to Western Psychia-
tric Institute, which is part of the
University Health Center of Pitts-
burgh, Inc.

The House is expected to vote on
the measure next week.

Police Oust Teamsters

Pitt police voted overwhelm-

voting for the Amalgamated Plant
Guard Union over 10 for the
Teamsters and 11 for no represen-

The results made the Plant
Guards Local 502 the official
representative for the 77 police on
campus, shutting out the Team-
sters, which represented the
University force at the time of last
week’s election.

Widespread dissatisfaction with

BUDGET PLANNING APPROVED

HARRISBURG (AP)—Legis-
lation to force the governor to share
budget planning with the legisla-
ture was approved 194-0 yesterday
by the House.

The bill was passed without
debate and sent to the Senate after
Republicans failed to pass two
amendments to make it even
stronger.

It would require the governor to
brief majority and minority leaders
each December on budget pros-
pects, and would set a deadline for
the governor's annual budget
proposal.

The proposal would have to be
given to the legislature by the first
Tuesday of each February, except
for a new governor, who would
have until the first Tuesday in
March. '

Revenue estimates, used to set
the state budget’s limits, would be
regulated by specific procedures
and-requirements. The bill would
establish a cabinet level office of
the budget.

NEWS BRIEFS

BUTLER TRANSIT
DISCONTINUED
BUTLER, Pa. (AP)-—The
Butler Motor Transit Co. said
Wednesday it will discontinue

week-day bus service in the Butler
area because it has no agreement
with state and local governments to
cover operating losses.

Last year, the company had a
$52,000 grant from the state,
township and city, but there is no

k £3'SuCh arrangement this year.

The company will continue to
operate a special bus for the elderly
on Saturdays. It also will continue
charter service.

The ﬁve buses carried about
11,000 passengers a month. Three
drivers will be laid off when the
service is discontinued.

CAMPAIGN FUNDS SLASHED

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
Federal Election Commission de-
termined yesterday that nine
presidential candidates will get no
more federal matching money
except to pay campaign debts
incurred before they bowed out of
the nomination races.

The FEC said the candidates
could appeal the ﬁnding. The
group includes Rep. Morris K.
Udall, Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
Gov. George C. Wallace and Sen.

Frank Church, four of the last ﬁve
major chasers of Jimmy Carter, the
apparent Democratic nominee. The
oiiiy candidates still considered
active for matching funds purposes
are Carter, President Ford, Ronald
Reagan and California Gov. Ed-
mund G. Brown Jr.

Federal law provides that a
person can get no more money for

' new debts if he or she is no longer

an active presidential candidate in
more than one state.

WARREN COMMISSION
REPORTS

WASHINGTON (AP)-—The
Senate intelligence committee said
yesterday the CIA and FBI failed
to provide the Warren Commission
with evidence that “might have
substantially affected the course of
the investigation” into whether
there was a conspiracy to kill
President John F. Kennedy.

The committee stressed that “it
has no uncovered any evidence
sufficient to justify a conclusion
that there was a conspiracy to
assassinate President Kennedy.”

But the panel said that failure of
the CIA and FBI to pursue the
possibility of a conspiracy behind
the assassination >“impeaches the
process" which led the Warren
Commission to conclude that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone.

Bryn Mawr- Vassar

Books, Not Classy Decor

BY MREA CSORBA

Though the name would
suggest it might, the Bryn Mawr-
Vassar Bookstore has no room for
classy decor. Thetiny two-story
resale shot, tucked away on
Winthrop Street, is lined top to
bottom with books.

What doesn't ﬁt on the ceiling-to

floor shelves ﬁows onto ﬁre—place
-mantles, window sills, or is stacked
into open closets. Books bury large
tables in the middle of the rooms,
or are packed into categorically
arranged boxes on the floor.
Finally the overflow is caught in a
basket outside on the landing——
books which are free for the
picking.

Polite, well-bred ladies with hair
bunned and appropriate hemlines
to match assist browsers through
this maze ‘of the printed word.
These women are alumnae of the
colleges the sign speaks of,
running a bookstore to raise
scholarship money for their alma
maters.

The business evolved from their
highly successful book sales held
annually in church basements. The
public’s response, both in the
books donated and in their
subsequent sale, lead to the
opening of the shop by a few of the
present 30-member crew four years
ago.

Since then, the number of books
has swelled geometrically, and all
books received are arranged
categorically between six room_s.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Tllihr ram arms 

Press Freedom

Dr. Albert Watrel was ﬁred recently from his post as president of
Slippery Rock State College for, among other things, “numerous
ﬁnancial problems” at the Pennsylvania school.

A second charge brought against Watrel was that he allegedly tried
to coerce the editors of the school newspaper, The Rocket, to print
articles favorable to his administration and suppress news which

showed Watrel in a bad light.

Much to the credit of The Rocket’s two editors, they went ahead with

an article detailing misuse of university funds by Watrel and other

administrators.

The two editors should be lauded for printing the article despite their
knowledge of what it could mean. The administration had threatened
the paper with a lawsuit, and had threatened to interfere with money
used to flmd The Rocket and pay the editors’ tuition. V

The problem at Slippery Rock, however, points out an all too
common problem at smaller colleges of that sort. Unlike the situation
at Pitt, Penn State and other universities wherethere is a large student
body, advertising revenues of small college papers are not enough to
cover more than a small part of the newspapers’ budgets.

While most college newspapers, such as the Pitt News and the Penn
State Daily Collegian, accept a fraction of the student activities fee and
payment from the general university fund in return for distributing the
paper at no cost, most smaller college newspapers receive a large
portion of their funding from the University. Any arrangement like

that is asking for trouble.

Many private colleges maintain editorial control of some sort over
their student newspapers by either direct censorship by an advisor, or
indirect methods such as appointment of editors by the college
president, or payment of editors’ tuition.

A situation where the editors face loss of tuition, expulsion, or
cancellation of publication over any criticism of the administration
fosters the type of journalism found today in too many small,

professional papers.

Many, many small towns have papers which will criticize politicians
and police, but never hint at any wrongdoing by the town’s big

business (i.e.—-big advertiser.)

College newspapers, and all newspapers for that matter, should be
in a position where they rely on no one source for survival. The
knowledge that one advertiser, or subsidizer, has ultimate control over
adequate funding would make any editor stop and think, and some
have not been as true to integrity as The Rocket.

Opinion

Anyone, Everyone Votes

BY CRIS HALL

The improprieties in the Commu-
ter Association office elections of
June 9 and 10 raise serious doubt
as to the ability of that group to
remain representatives of more
than half of Pitt’s students.

Voters were improperly recruited
by an election worker. Voters were
not required, or even asked, to
produce any identif1cation——no Pitt
ID, no drivers license, not even a
social security card. Nothing.

At least one voter used an
assumed name while voting. No
Pitt student belongs to at least one
name which appears on the list of
those who voted.

At least one voter was told by the
election worker that the balloting
was “a joke.”

Unfortunately, he was right. But
there’s not much to laugh about.

Faced with the possibility of
losing’ its status as a student

' organization and, as a result, its

Student Government funding, the
CA staged the two-day election to
comply with a Committee on

freshman camp, you create the
illusion that your article is every bit
as factual as the others on that
page. Therefore, it is not at all
difficult to believe that you
deliberately sought to mislead the
freshmen.

To the reader unfamiliar with the
format of The Pitt News, the
phrase, “Behind the Lines," gives
no indication as to the opinionated
nature of your article. This is
deception, Mr. Moore! And your
attempt at deception is as
degrading to the , rest of the
University community as it is to the
freshmen.

It appears reasonable to infer
that you, Mr. Moore, not the

ﬁrst-year grade school, not college,
students.”' Do you honestly
believe that the freshmen cannot
discern fact from opinion? Is that
your justiﬁcation for the deceptive
nature of your article?

I suggestthat in the coming
months you give serious thought to
the meanings of the words, ethics,
honesty and integrity. Unfortu-

already too familiar with the

Student Organizations mandate it
hold ofﬁcer elections and furnish
proof it has 25 active members
before July 1.

The CA was lucky if it coaxed two
dozen actual commuters to vote for
an unopposed slate. Not exactly a
mandate.

It is obvious commuters, who are
a majority of Pitt students, need a
representative body to provide
leadership in tackling issues such
as parking, afternoon entertain-
ment and others which affect them
as students and commuters.

But the half-hearted attempt to
hold a fair election shows the
present Commuter Association is
not to be trusted with the Student
Government funding necessary to
represent Pitt’s commuter interest.

The Committee on Student
Organizations was correct in
requiring the CA furnish proof it is
really representing the group
whose name it carries. It is also
correct in requiring the CA hold
another election or defend the June
9 and 10 ﬁasco.

And the CS0 will be correct if it
recommends denial of CA funding
and organizational status, based on
the evidence currently available.

Diane Giebler, who was elected
president in the recent election,
has charged the CS0 review is an
attempt by the Student Govern-
ment Board to annex the CA.

. While it is probably true the SGB
wouldn’t mind taking the CA under
its wing as another committee,
Giebler is incorrect.

The student who discovered the
improprieties was not acting as a
SGB agent.

In fact, the SGB has had little, if
anything to do with the CS0
investigation. It certainly did not
spur the CS0 into action. Charges
were brought by a student and the
CS0 followed up on them.

The only error CSO might have
made was in acting too late. July is
not a good time to hold elections for
an organization which represents
students who will be here in the fall
and winter.

It is clear commuters cannot be
called upon to decide who will
represent them until September. In
the meantime, however, the SGB
must decide what to do about
funding a commuter group.

The only options seemingly

available to the SGB are the .

recognition and funding of the
present CA, or the formation of a
commuter-oriented committee of
Student Government.

The latter alternative wold lead
to vehement criticism from the
present core of CA members. The
latter, based on current evidence.
would be disastrous if the CA
handled funds as well as it holds
elections.

It is a tough decision, and the
only way it will be made an easier
one is if the CA decides to hold a
decent election before July 1. They
probably won’t.

If they don’t, the SGB, should it
make the right decision, will be in
for a lot of criticism and the present
CA will ﬁnd itself out of business.
but the real losers will be Pitt’s
commuters.

J‘, Does Disco

BY TOM WASELESKI

Beyond Mobius, Cedar Walton.
RCA Records, APL-1435.

Just at the height of the disco
rage, when every major city has its
own disco station and a rock dance
hall can scarcely survive without it,
comes this album—a collection of
some of the best disco tunes to
come out in recent years.

Arranging the pieces is Cedar

alton, soul-jazz keyboard master,
and performing with Walton is
Eddie Harris on sax, Blue Mitchell,
Eric Gale andnumerous other jazz
and funk notables.

The title track is a Walton
original, featuring some zippy
organ work by the composer. The
horn section is full, with solos for
trumpet and ﬂugelhorn, while
Jimmie Young on percussion and
Gordon Edwards on bass provide
solid backup. Walton switches to
an echoing synthesizer on the
chorus, supported by a stiff line of
saxes.

Rider" to a tee, despite only taken
vocals. Harris does plenty of
shining on his sax when Mitchell
1sn’t measuring out sharp blows on
his horn.

“Bad Luck" is fresh and funky
as ever, with female chorus and a
strong bass by Gordon Edwards.
The only weak spot on this one is
the backup strings, which leak
through the jazz every once in a
while, sounding terribly monoto-

nous and out of step with the rest of
the song’s vibrancy.

Walton is right on the mark with
his synthesizers throughout the
Bee Gees’ “Jive Talkin’,” last
summer's biggest disco hit. The
vocals are a little too bland and too
unabashedly imitative of the cut’s
original singers, however, and rob
Walton of an overall good
arrangement.

The piano on “Canadian Sun-

Thursday, June 24, l976—THE PITT NEWS—Page 5

set” is so straight, leaving the jazz
_to percussion and guitar, that for a
moment it sounds like just any
other pianist. But the piece
belongs, adding some fresh air to
the album’s heavy disco romp.
“The Girl With Discotheque
Eyes” is a collaboration of Walton
and Mike Lipskin, and is the only
tune here with any appreciable
amount of lyrics. The voices are
smoothly alluring and provide a

contrast to the torpid jazz solos by
trumpet, organ and guitar.
Another Walton creation is
“Lonely Cathedral," the album’s
closer, and a low-‘keyed one at that.
Using full and mellow horns, the
steam is all gone from this cut
when compared with the others.
Nothing’s lost, though. This is a
great party album, and that last
track’ll do just fine when things
begin to wind down.

——-Space Oddity

‘- “Space Oddity,” a tale of
compassion and the death of a hero
(Major Tom, who has a God’s-eye
view of, but can do nothing about
the blue planet, earth, was a
significant jumping point for
Bowie’s career (it was his first big
hit in England and America) and is
the opening tune on his latest
release, a greatest hits collection.

These songs are of Bowie as a

' hustling, young artist. We saw his

changing guises from starman to
punk to rebel to his last; a settled,
successful man trying to hustle,
socialize and still hide from the
machinations of modern living.

The songs are as varied as the
changes. A fine dance-love tune,
“John, I’m Only Dancing,” a
British hit a few years back, is
released here for the first time in
America. His master treatise on
time, “Changes,” a song in which
Bowie takes the conclusion of T.S.
Eliot’s Four Quartets and synthe-
sized it into a song, is also offered.
A song which ranges from
philosophy to the guise of the old
story-telling, future-sighting min-
strel, is “Diamond Dogs.” But
there were still more changes to
come.

Possibly the biggest change, the
transcendence from fame by
destroying it it in a song, is “Ziggy
Stardust,” a song about witch-
burning which features rock star
Ziggy as a main course destroyed
by his" own ego.

At that point of his career, Bowie
had become the famous rock star-
rebel-troubadour; a symbol of
decadence he was displeased with
and which would eventually lead
him to the role of an entertainer
talking to a whole generation and
beyond—breaking down racial
walls with funk, and generation
gaps with lyric poetry.

His latest claim to fame,
“Golden Years,” is a survival
handbook for the present: “Don’t
let me hear you say that life is
taking you nowhere...the lights are
warm and the days are young...
never look up; walk tall; act
fine...Nothing’s gonna touch you in
these golden years...Run for the
shadows” repeated again and
again, following a litling, poetic list
of the images of these golden
years...keep a stiff, if hidden,
upper lip in this, new fabulous

“ﬁfties” era.
Bowie is an entertainer of the

‘stature of Frank Sinatra as he

reflects the present time, not only
in song, but also on ﬁlm. His

Not Hot, These

BY M. C. PILECKI

Lately, the only reason to go to
the movies has been to enjoy the air
conditioning.

The stuff they’re sticking onto
reels these days isn’t all that hot
(sorry about that). _Summer just
gets the dregs of the movie
industry, with only the rarest of
exceptions.

There’s not much that can be
hoped for with Tunnel Vision, a
real loser of a ﬂick. Those who
attend the ﬂick expecting to see
Chevy Chase (mentioned in the
ads) will be disappointed—he’s on
screen for less than three minutes.
And those who go expecting to see
another slightly pornographic TV
sative like The Groove Tube will be
utterly bored.

Tunnel Vision is, if anything, a
satire of itself. And not a very
interesting one at that. It purports
to be a preview of a future
“alternative” TV network in a
society that’s even more decayed
than the present one. The movie
doesn't clamp down much on TV as
we know it, but rather pretends to
predict the morality of tomorrow.

If that sounds dull, don’t worry.
So is the movie. If there were any
gags in there, they fell ﬂat. Sure,
there’s some borderline soft-score
porno, but nothing as raucous as in
The Groove Tube. Nothing as
funny, either. There wasn’t even
enough to force a giggle out of
anyone in the audience.

Bugs Bunny Superstar has to be
listed as a disappointment, too,
mainly because of the Mickey-
Mouse production (sorry about this
one, too). It looks like a home
movie, with cartoons strung along
by (guess what?) a home movie of
the original Looney Tune cartoon-
ists acting silly. It features a
narration by one of the “grownup”
cartoonists who is wearing the
worst toupee imaginable.

The cartoons are fine, all right,
but the narration would have been
better with more emphasis on the
evolution of the cartoon characters,
and less on the cartoonists. And,
for that matter, more showing of
the older, rarely seen cartoons-
like Tweetie Pie’s or Bugs’ first. It
was stupid to mention them in the
movie and then not show them. As
it turns out, Bugs.Bunny Superstar

as

recent movie has him portrayed as
a space being falling to earth
becoming a corporation executive,
succumbing to the pleasures
money can bring with the mind
overloaded by technological lei-
sure, as he “runs for the
shadows.” It’s like Sinatra singing
“It Was A Very Good Year,” as
Bowie walks the stage, now in
conservative shirt and deep-v-
necked, black body suit.

A rebel grown up with dreams
suppressed, he's a picture of the
successful entertainer, cooly sing-
ing into the microphone with
sparse band back-up.

The rebel may be older, but not
gone. His outbursts of song still
reﬂect the times and desires we are
growing up with: freedom in “Jean
Genie,” the legacy of the outcast in

“Rebel, Rebel,” and the tell-it- ’

like-it-is optimism of “Young
Americans.” _ _ _
Even if Bowie’s in retirement

once again, his legacy still bears
fruit, after all the changes, in the
golden years.

Reels

is too much like a high school
yearbook-—-juvenile and full of
in-jokes. And missing the real
superstars.

The Missouri Breaks had one
superstar too many, mainly Marlon
Brando in his most eccentric
performance since he embarrassed
himself in Mutiny on the Bounty.

Breaks sports a tired “modern
Western” plot chock full of
violence (but no sex—explaining its
PG rating). Jack Nicholsen gives
his usual steller performance,
wasted on an inane plot about a
psychopathic killer (Brando) and a
bunch of horse thieves (headed by
Nicholson) played against a gor-
geous Western backdrop———showing
again the beauties of nature
against the ugliness man brings.

Unless you can groove on Brando
dreaming up cute ways to kill off
the other characters, Breaks is one
big bore. The humor of Brando’s
outlandish portrayal grows thin
very quickly, and the slight
characterization of Nicholson as the
badman unwittingly going straight
is not enough to sustain the ﬂick.

After this, one longs for the
‘reality of John Wayne movies. ,

I've heard of “two for the price of one,” but this was ridiculous. I
heard some pretty fine music June 12 at Three Rivers Stadium, and

saw one whale of a riot.

When I walked up to Gate A around 5 p.m. for the ZZ Top and
Aerosmith concert, my initial reaction was one of shock. The gate’s
runway looked like a tornado had hit. Broken glass, empty beer cans,
bags of popcorn and people who looked like they had just swallowed a

zonked from the blazing sun.

Rivers.

plate of cornchips covered the ground like a blanket. I knew right then
and there that this crowd was burned out. '

Aerosmith, a hard rock-heavy metal band from Boston, was revving
up when I found refuge in the press box. Five hundred feet from the .
stage, I could watch the free-for-all below me in safety.

I guess the best way to describe the action in the festive seats would
be to call it a cross between a perverted 4th of July celebration and a
full-scale pier six brawl. People were not only boppin’ to the music of
Aerosmith, but also beatin’ each other up, and engaging in a
dangerous firework-throwing spree.

During the intermission between Aerosmith and the headliners, ZZ
Top, all hell seemed to break loose.

I counted 15 major brawls. One girl had a cherry bomb explode in
her lap, and another bushy-haired young lass’ hair went up in ﬂames
from a sparkler. Everyone else was bummed out on dope, beer, or

Sure, it was the first outdoor concert of the summer, and sure, the
music of ZZ Top and Aerosmith is aggressive hard rock, but that's no
excuse for the antics pulled by some of the idiots in attendance.

I believe in partying ’till the heart’s content, but I don't believe in
hurting people. Throwing sparklers, firecrackers and empty bottles
and cans is asinine and downright dangerous.

Recently, there has been talk of banning future concerts at Three
I think it would be a wise move.

After all, the only people who come out ahead on stadium shows are

the promoters and performers.

With tickets going for nearly nine

bucks a crack, multiplied by over 50,000 fans, they clean up royally. It’s
the fans who come out on the short end. V

The inflated stadium show prices hurt the pocket book, and what’s
worse, the fans dish out money to attend a concert in a stadium so large

they can barely see the stage.

Many people told me that they were bored at the June 12 concert.
They could hear, all right, but the performers were as small as ants,
while the insanity around them was grotesque.

‘-‘This ain’t rock ‘n roll, this is genocide," is a linelborrowed from

David Bowie.

I now know what he was talking about.

The Plight
Of The “Unfan”

BY BILL MOORE

Unfan. It isn’t really a word, but should be.

It's a word needed to characterize that fraction of college students
who scratch their heads when their friends at the lunch table talk about
some guy named Dorsett. To describe the college students who look
out their Tower C window on Saturday mornings and wonder why all
those people are walking up to the stadium. To describe the students
who can't yet quite understand why their fathers would always go to
the sports pages ﬁrst.

I admit, I was at one'Pitt football game. But I didn’t watch it. The
first play was good; someone dropped the ball. My friend, Pete, said it
was a fumble. Nobody fumbled on the second play so I went and
bought a hot dog.

On the way to get the hot dog I ran into an old friend named Mark.
We started talking, and then it was interrnission...er, halftime. That
was fun. I like bands.

The game started again, and I left.

Being an unfan is not unlike having cooties. You go to a party, and
someone asks you what you think of this year’s basketball team.

“Well, uh, I don't really pay that much attention,” you answer.

“Oh. Well, never mind.” And they walk away.

You go home for a weekend and your father says, “Great game last
week wasn’t it. Pitt clobbered Notre Dame. How did you like it?”

“Uh, I wasn't there, Dad.”

“You okay, son? What's wrong, aren’t you feeling well?”

My father and I talk less and less every time I go home now.

Being an unfan is so unAmerican. Everyone else is in on something
you know nothing about. They have their own heros, their own
language. They talk about redshirts and RBI’s and ERA’s and the like,
and they might as well be speaking Flemish.

As a kid, I collected pictures of the Beatles. No one wanted "to trade
two Don Drysdals for a Ringo, so no one bothered to call me. After
school, everyone would go to the basketball games, and I would go
home and watch “Leave it to Beaver.” On Saturday's they would go to
football games and I would mow the lawn.

Monday mornings I would go into school, and they’d look at me like I
was leperous. “Where were you, numbskull?”

My sophomore English teacher in high school was also the football
coach. Two days before each game, he devoted the entire class period
to talking about the team. “Hey, Bill, who do you think should
quarterback? Solymosi or Carrara?” I wouldn't have an answer. I
didn’t even know who Solymosi and Carrara were. I ﬂunked that year,
despite a 93 on the ﬁnal.

My attractiveness to the opposite sex was not enhanced much by the
fact my dates would have to explain the game to me when we went to
the stadium on Saturday nights. It was supposed to be the other way.

A few of the hulks on the team would grab me in the hallways of my
high school to tell me they had names for my kind. Queer, I think it
, .was.

At times I'm proud of my status as an unfan. I am a rebel, a man
who marches to a different drummer. But most of the time I feel
handicapped, marked for life, queer.

I tried. God knows I tried. I subscribed to Sports Illustrated for a
year. I read it religiously cover to cover. When the year was up, I knew
nothing. I hadn't understood a word of it.

I'm going to be a Pirate fan, I decided last month. For a week,
whenever anyone would say “Hello," I would answer, “Go Bucs!” I
read the Press sports pages, and relished every word Bob Smizick
wrote. When the week was over, I quit and went back to the funnies.

I can name the prime minister of any emerging African nation you
can think of but the only Pirate player I can name is Sandy Koufax.
And that might not even be right.

I bought a season pass for next year’s Pitt football games. I bought a
warm blanket, and a wine bota, so I could be like everyone else. I
looked up Tony Dorsett’s name in a yearbook so I know who he is. “Go
T.D., Go T.D.!”

Chances are good—-—in fact it is a foregone conclusion—the ticket will
lie in my dresser drawer ’til I ﬁnd a friend to lend it to.

~ And next year, next year when the leaves turn red and blow across
Fifth Avenue. Next year when you've got your quart of rum and space
blanket tucked under your arm and your’re headed for the stadium.
Next year when Tony Dorsett repeats as all-American. Next year when
Pitt is number one, you can ﬁnd me in my room watching “Godzilla
Eats the Flower Children” for the ﬁfth time.

Pitt-State
Ticket Orders

Now Accepted

Ticket orders are being accepted
at the Pitt ticket ofﬁce for the
Pitt-Penn State football game,
which will be held November 26 in
Three Rivers Stadium. Kickoff is
scheduled for 9:05 p.m.

The game was originally sche-
duled for November 20 at Universi-
ty Park, but was switched to the
new date and location so it could be
shown on national television by
ABC.

Although all details of the switch
have not been worked out by the
two schools, each school is to
receive approximately 25,000 tic-
kets for the game. Pitt fans and
students are reminded that, al-
though the game is now to be
played in Pittsburgh, the game is
not part of the regular session
ticket package.

ticket ofﬁce in the Field House, or
by writing to the ticket office, P.O.
Box 7436, Pittsburgh, Pa., 15213.

Debbie Jones Quits Pitt, Heads For Maryland

BY CRIS HALL

Debbie Jones, the 5-11 captain of
Pitt’s women’s basketball team,
said yesterday that she has made
an “irreversible” decision to trans-
fer to the University of Maryland
and spend the last two seasons of
her college career a Terpette.

Jon‘es, an all-American candidate
who averaged 15 rebounds and a

like number of points per game last
season while leading the Panther-
‘ettes to a 16-8 record and a
consolation championship in the
AIAW eastern regionals, said she
decided in the past two weeks to
leave ﬁrst-year coach Pat Wal-
lace's program in favor on Terp
coach Chris Waller’s squad be-
cause she “wasn’t happy playing
basketball at Pitt”

"1 just didn’t feel I enjoyed
playing the game, and when I don’t
enjoy playing the game, that’s
something to worry about,” Jones
said.

Jones will be able to play for
Maryland next season, her junior
year, because AIAW rules, unlike
those of the NCAA, do not force
transfer students to sit out a year of
action before playing for a new
school. ‘

Jones_ will not, however, be
eligible for an athletic scholarship
from Maryland until her senior
year.

Jones said she had not told
Wallace of her decision to leave,
but the Pantherette coach did learn
the news yesterday while vacation-
ing in eastern Pennsylvania.

Wallace said she had known her
star was deliberating a transfer,
but said she was “a little
surprised“ at the news because
Jones had given her the impression
she would stay in a telephone con-
versation two weeks ago.

Jones said the Pitt coaching staff
influenced her decision to abandon
the Blue and Gold.

 

 A‘ ' - “
Debbie Jones says she’s played her
last game as a Pantherette.

“I didn’t like some of the things
the coaches were doing,” Jones
said. “I don’t feel our basketball
team was in very good physical
condition during the season.” A

Wakkace became Pitt’s head
‘coach following the controversial
ﬁring of Jean Condo last Novem-
her.

‘‘I was very upset when coach
Condo was ﬁred,” Jones said.
“She really worked, put a lot into
it. I also feel the reason why she
was ﬁred was unexplained.”

“The spirit on the team is very
low,” Jones said. She added she
believed there was dissension
among team members and that she
had progressed very little in her
two years at Pitt.

Jones said she expects to make
the Terpette’s starting lineup next
year, and that she ﬁrst became
interested in Maryland’s program
when she saw the Terpettes play in
last year’s eastern regionals.

Her ﬁrst contact with Weller, she
said, came at the AIAW champion-
ships at Penn State.

Jones’ departure will probably
leave her team-leader responsibili-
ties to Kim Raymond, a 5-11
sophomore fron Toms River, New
Jersey.

Cubs Nip Moose, Bucs, 6-5  

BY JOE TYBOR
AP Sports Writer

CHICAGO (AP)—A ninth inn-
ing error by pitcher Bob Moose,
Pittsburgh's ﬁfth error of the
game, scored Jose Cardenal and
helped the Chicago Cubs snap a
four-game losing streak with a 6-5
victory over the Pirates in the ﬁrst
game of a doubleheader yesterday.

Moose's error came on a high
hopper by Jerry Morales after the
Cubs opened the ninth with singles
by Joe Wallis and Cardenal. After
Bill Madlock forced Wallis at third,
Moose threw wild to second
attempting to force Madlock.

Oscar Zamora, 3-2, picked up the
win in relief. Moose is now 3-3.

The Pirates had pulled into a 5-5
tie in the top of the eighth when
Richie Zisk blasted his eighth home
run of the season, with Dave Parker
on base.

Two of Pittsburgh's errors came
in the ﬁfth inning helping the Cubs
to a four-run rally and 5-1 lead.

The Cubs scored their ﬁrst run
without the aid of a hit. Manny
Trillo led off the second with a walk
and stole second base. With one
out. he stole third and scored on
Manny Sangui1len’s throwing er-
ror on the play.

The Pirates came back with one
run in the fourth on successive
two-out doubles by Zisk and Bill
Robinson.

Pittsburgh added runs on Star-
gell’s ninth homer, in the sixth,
and Tommy Helms’ sacriﬁce ﬂy, in
the seventh.

The second game was postponed
because of darkness after four
innings with the Pirates leading
2-0. The game was to be resumed
today prior to the day’s regularly
scheduled gaine.

 
    

throwing error allowed Jose Carde-
nal to score the game-winning run
in the Cubs’ 6-5 win over the
Pirates.
