DOWN THE HILL

By BILL CATROW

And now from the ridiculous to

the sublime, from the trash to the
trite, or however yourwill have it.

Gus Wilde and Betty Ann Crede
have been much talked of for a
very long time, but thelring that
Credie has been sporting for the
last month surely adds a perman-

ent note to their affections.

It’s real fraternity spirit when
you can keep your engagement a
secret for four long days just so
you can tell your “sisters” all at
once. That is what Jean Kimpel did,
and it was quite a party that she

and the lucky man, Dick Brunk, gave
for the Phi Mus on Monday night.

Just heard—--and ‘ rather belat-

edly at that-.-—that Lorna’ Hazel-
ton spent the-week - end before

last doing her very best to pro-
vide. a very pleasant time for

Johnny Sy-ka, Rhode Island Navy

man.

Speaking of a guy that you’ll

' never see ata. campus social ‘with-

out something smart in fem com-
panionship and you’re' just natur-
ally talking about Bob Buell-af-
fectionately-_ and direspectfully

known as “Bubbles? —, and for

proof cite" Sammy Round, Dot‘
Mooney, Barbara Owens, et al.

4 Possibly the most lonely girl on
campus last‘ Saturday p. in. was
rebel girl Jane Dudley. Going steady
is certainly fun until your man goes
out oftown-for a -week, and engi-
neerslike Lee Zeigler just-can’t be
depended uponto stick around. .

In case. you haven’t had time to
inquire, the reason Milt Lopatin

‘isn’t wearing his pin is that he

and Anita Stewart just”can’t wear

ical, now, isn’t it?)

it at the same ‘time. (Kinda log-_

Among the boys who won’t be

around much anymore——in fact, u

 Y Performs Wide Variety
pf Of Service For Soldiers

. “Nothing too little, nothing too big” for the soldiers at the Univer-
, sity has become more than a slogan of the Pitt YMCA, for they will do
just about anything for the men stationed at Pitt——-anything from per-
sonal advice and supplies to weddings!
Recently an air student wanted to get married, but there were many
legal matters to be taken care of, since both he and his bride-to-be were
{- ,from out of the state. Arrangements had to be made before the wedding,
A but the desperate soldier had only a Saturday. afternoon.
When Mr. W. Wray Miller, program chairman of the YMCA branch
at Pitt, heard the student’s problem, he made all the arrangements for the
ceremony and took care of the soldier's legal matters so that he could get

his marriage license.

The soldier was married, and once again the “Y” had come through.
The YMCA program at Pitt includes the men in uniform as well
as the civilian students. Nearly 40,000 individual services were per-
‘formed by the Pitt “Y” for the military personnel on the campus in

the past six months. Among these
v were 28 feature movie shows
' ‘which were presented on Wednes-
, "day evenings, entertaining 8,083
’ soldiers. Movies will continue in

Room G-24CL with a schedule of
., recent feature pictures.

In his four weekly visits to the
inﬁrmary and hospital, Mr. Miller
_has made 2,780 contacts with sol-
= 'diers who were on sick calls. Pur-

pose of these visits was to provide
‘ for whatever need arose and to visit

\’_ aw soldiers who were not only sick but

'\

‘ lonely. On one occasion, a soldier
was ready to come out of the hospi-

fj. tal but found he had no clothes ex-

. I

' lciept the pajamas he had on when

'. the ambulance brought him to the

I  hospital. Immediately Mr. Miller
,. salvaged a pair of pants and sent
- ahappy soldier home. The soldier
, who now is back to active duty has

 grateful memories of the “Y.’—'

The “Y” also furnishes the sol-

: ;/ “ iliers with books, magazines, and

stationery. For those who enjoy
.._music, it provides classical rec-

‘. ‘X’ jords as well as popular pieces. The

. “Y” ollice offers the men a place
" of relaxation.
"Mr. Miller acts as a “one man
information center.” In addition to
 discussing their problems with him,
soldiers have him" buy their train

5 tickets, make. train reservations,

.5 have their ﬁlms developed, and take

\

7 care of money orders because their

personal time is so limited. On one
occasion a soldier who was a per-

New Books Stock
Alldred Library

A number of new books have
been added to the collection of the
Alldred room.

The new group of book includes
many novels. E. Arnot Robertson's

“The Signpost” is a very timely
work. which follows the life of an
RAF pilot in Ireland. It pictures
the life and customs in Eire, afford-
ing a’ better understanding of the
position which Ireland has taken
in the world today. The scene for
“Liana” by Martha Gellhorn is set
on the French Island St. Boniface
in the Caribbean. It is a story of
the marriage of a white man to a
mulatto and the problems which
arise through racial differences.
“If you enjoyed “My Friend
Flicka,” you’ll want to read Mary
O’Hara’s new book, “Thunder-
head,” the sequel. It is full of ex-
citing adventure, centered upon
“Thunderhead,” the white colt of
Flicka. What happens when peo-
ple of one continent go to live on
another continent is revealed in
Kay Boyle's ""Avalanche.”, The
romantic tale of an inn run by an
ex-sailor unfolds itself in “The
Golden Fleece,” by Norah Lofts.
A stirring tale of the American
trek westward and the terrible
ﬁght around the invasion of the
locusts is found in ‘The Lpcusts”
by Otto Schragg.

Students of religion will be in-
terested in “The Life of Jesus” by
Maurice Goguel and “A Portrait of
Jesus” by Sherwood Eddy.

For anyone interest in myths
“Indian Legends of the Te-0-ne-sta’.’
by Berta Livermore‘ is available.

The only travel book is Carveth
Wells’ “Introducing Africa,”- a
small, general account of the coun-
try. , .

Inline with the war have come
Leland Stowe’s “They Shall Not
Sleep” and “Target Germany.” The
former is a commentary on the war
as Mr. Stowe saw it and of the
prospects for peace. “Target Ger-
many” is the Army Air Forces’
official account of the VIII Bomber
_C_ommand’s ﬁrst year over Europe.

Lenten Services Stimulate
Worship Among Students

Students requested the the Uni-
versity sponsor weekly Lenten
services being presented in Heinz
Chapel throughout the present Len-
ten season. These services are pure-
ly non-sectarian. Their chief pur-
pose is to stimulate worship among
all students and members o‘f the
faculty, without distinction as to
race or religion.

Today’s service will be sponsored
b_v‘Pitkin Club under the direction
of Student Leader Mary’Jean Nelan,
Ed, president of the club.

Dr. Hugh Thomson Kerr, pastor
of the Shadyside Presbyterian
Church, will speak on “The Mean-
ing of the Cross.” Dr. Kerr, a
trustee of the University, founded
Pitkin Club 30 years ago. He is a.
graduate of the University of
Toronto Theological Seminary and
obtained his D.D. and L.L.D. de-
grees at Pitt. He has been pastor
at Shadyside for 13,years.

The Lenten program was first pre-
sented last year. Services are under
the direction of the different church
groups represented on campus. Each
week a new group plans the pro-
gram and obtains the student lead-
er, the speaker, and the musical so-
loist. Miss Alice Long, soprano so-
loist at Shadyside Presbyterian
Church, will sing “Oh, Divine Re-
deemer” by Charles Gounod at to-
day’s service.

Psych Fraternity Elects

penetrated by the electron beam.
When sectioning biological ma-
terials such as tissues, a section
thickness of ten microns may be
satisfactory for light observation,’
but for-- penetration and resolu-
tion of structural detail by the
‘electron beam, the thickness must
be only one-hundredth as great,
or about.‘0.1'micron. Such a sec-
tion thickness would lead from
gross tissue and- cell structure in-
_to the realm of cellular elements.
Unless ‘such a thin section is pro-
duced, the electronbeam furnish-
es us with -gsiihouette images.
Those images ,may..be large and
striking butare limited. in value.
It has been obvious since the in-
vention of the electron microscope
that new methods of histological
and cytological technique must be
discovered. With the ﬁnest of mod-
ern microtomes, it is possible to pro-
cure sections of biological material

.of approximately one micron in
thickness. Such- sections ‘are pro-

duced only with great diﬂiculty and
are ten times too thick to be used

' in electron microscopy. Some suc-

cess has attended the production of
thinner sections by the so-called
wedge technique. The diﬂiculties and
irregularities accompanying this
teclmique have been almost insur-
mountable. A , '

Mr. O’Brien, in working for his
doctor’s degree, under the guid-
ance of Dr. G. M. McKinley,’ has
modified the old microtomevby de- ,
veloping a new feeding arrange-_
ment and rotary knife. With this
new microtome the specimen is
constantly moved toward a rotary
“Cyclone” knife revolving at 10,-

. 000 revolutions per minute or
faster, the edge describing a cir-
cumference of ‘eight inches. At
12,500 revolutions per minute, the
blade is traveling. 100,000 inches
per minute which is about 1,000
times as fast as ordinary micro-V

’ tome movement. The advantage
of this high speed is that the spec-

.imen when being cut will have the '
strain distribution localized at the
knife edge.‘Therefore,' when these
slides are made, the contact per-

‘ iod is short, .0001 second, causing
little deformation to the tissue.

The properties of the substance
to be cut must be known when mak-
ing these sections; some of these
properties are the plastic ﬂow, hard-
ness, coefiicient of expansion and
many others. With high speed cut-
ting, plastic ﬂow does not occur. The
thermal expansion effect when sec-
tions are made with this high speed
knife is negligible. In view of this,
nothing has to be done tothe ma-
terial when sectioning. Whenthese

Pitt "During War,’
In Spring show

_“Furlough, But Not Furlong,”
Pitt Players production to be pre-
sented around Spring Fesival time,

' is just one big satire on Pitt4Pitt

students, Pitt professors, and Pitt
institutions.

Joe, former Pitt student but now
in the army, comes home on a 24-
hour pass and has six hours to
spend at Pitt with his college sweet-
heart. Everything happens to pre-
vent the meeting.

As he is waiting for her in the
elevator corridor (great Pitt in-
stitution) a test air raid is held. A
warden. who goes into action too
zealously knocks Joe senseless.
In this state of mind, he wanders
about the Cathedral, seeing Pitt
at war. .

Pushed by the crowd into the
Commons Room, Joe sees the spring
registration. It is the usual Pitt
registration, except for one thing.
The professors are standing’-before
a blockade of tableshearing a stu-
Just
Biz Ads.” . ‘

In the Tuck shops, the habits and
ideas of the students are. satirized
mercilessly. The army and admin-
istrators at Pitt are “given a going
over” when Joe‘ hears a ‘discussion

in a class room.

At last,.Joe ‘is’ brought to con-
sciousness to ﬁnd his‘ girl at his
side. The ﬁnale‘ is their reunion,
under the clock in the elevator
corridor.

Original music will be injected
into the ‘skits at a rapid rate. The_
theme song’ of the production .is
“Wasn’t It a Wonderful Furlough.”
Others include “There_You Are,”
“Before It’s Too, Late,” and “With

. All  Heart.”

The Players are attempting to
form a Pitt orchestra for the show.
Anyone who can play an instru-
ment may try out today "at 3:30
o’clock in the Stephen Foster Me-
morial. ‘ _

The cast will be announced next

cussion.

Paul Lukas, as was generally
expected, was cited for the best
male lead performance of 1943.
His performance in the play,

“Watch On the Rhine,” and later
in the movie, which differed only
slightly, had been praised every-
where. So far so good. The an-
nouncement that “Casablanca”
was the best moving picture of
1943 shocked the public consider-
ably. “It was a swell picture, but
. . .” was the consensus of com-
ments. Finally came the an-
nouncement that one. Jennifer
Jones had won the same academy
award which in recent years has
been the possession of Bette Da-
vis, Louise Rainer, and Ginger
Rogers, all substantial and famil-
iar names. Maybe she deserved
it, and maybe she didn’t. Thus far
“The Song of Bernadette” has
been seen by a minor fraction of
the public. At the date of the
Academy banquet, sixty days had
- elapsed since 1943 had expired-—
Hollywood logic nevertheless de-
crees that Jennifer -‘Jones con-
tributed the outstanding efemale
leading , performance of 1943.

Exactly what makes ‘the Holly-
wood thinking «machinery move as
it does? “Casablanca” was certain-
ly an extremely popular moving
picture. Box-oﬁice receipts set a
record for 1943. Does. this, neces-
sasily prove that it . was the best
ﬁlm of the year? An unbiased eval-
uation must present the fact that
“Casablanca” Was a chameleon in
quality. Consistency of intention and
of taste was lacking. The characters
moved about mouthing romantic
gush, which is all right in its place;
without warning the direction of
the story moved to social import
and again to romance, then to melo-

Having nothing more pressing to write about this week, “Rambling
Reviews” will concern itself with the Academy Awards.

The yearly awards of the Hollywood Academy of Arts and Sciences_
have come to be both an American and a Hollywood institution. M0515:
members of the public are interested. primarily in the best performances \
and best picture awards. Honors for technical achievements are often as j‘
important from the standpoint of progress as the acting and direction‘_
prizes. However, that phase of the awards will be ignored in this disc

drama. “The Ox-Bow Incident” for,  
instance had one theme, one mood,-T. . _ _
one overall personality. “Watch On? . —

The Rhine” had one dominant all 
consuming theme; the _ change in . ‘ ' ,
emotional tone was perfectly con’-‘  -

sistent to the development of the -, 
plot. No incident or scene was com-. 

plete in itself.‘In “Casablanca”.-».», 

Humphrey Bogart makes love, and5 . 
that’s that. Then he assists a ‘refuel *_ 
gee, and the incident is complete: -' 

“Casablanca” bit off more than it+_‘;:‘ 
could chew; excellent acting, _di1'ec-  
tion, and laudability of intention _
saved the day, but was it the ‘best, 
movie of 1943? 7 . -

 and that the present rushing
system be changed in certain re-
iispects. ‘ ' ‘ '

 During the ﬁrst spring

_o’oun‘cil. “Besides, it will give the

‘beneﬁts of a'fraternity."

fTol eliminate pre-rushing and

isilg-advised that a maximum of three

The main objection to the entire
plan was the obstacle of two pledge
éjlasses throughout the remaining
months of the spring semester. “It
will" be difficult,” pointed out a
member, to train the pledges as

decided to let each fraternity work

University Plans
Veterans’ Assoc.
For . Dischargees

War veterans of World War II
who are now taking classes at the
University have proved that they
know how to get things done in
hurry. ‘

Steps are already being taken to
organize them into an association of
war veterans. This association will
then "be an integral part of the
men’s regular campus organiza-
tions.

Purpose of the organization is
two-fold. It aims to unite these
veterans because of their common
backgrounds and enable them to
help one another and to place the
University facilities at their dis-
posal. In this way, all the govern-
ment information, concerning ben- _

.eﬁts' to which they are entitled,
will be made available to them as
quickly as possible.

Special tests and educational de-
vices are being planned to deter-
mine .t_he veterans’ abilities and
professional objectives, which may
have changed" as a result of their.
recent , experiences. _

About one-third of the veterans

were Pitt students before they en- _

tered the service. One of the men
saw action in the Atlantic and the
Paciﬁc, one was wounded in North
-Africa, one came back from Eng-
land, and one was wounded ‘in the
Paciﬁc. ‘ _ . '
“These veterans represent the
future of the University,” said
Chancellor John G. Bowman.

taken in $42,000 he would have been entitled to a 50-50 share of the-Q:

Regardless of whatever success the Panther nine rnay"

 T ; if Clinic Considers
  SW... Problems
Sol Retail Stores '

, On Tuesday and Wednesday,
March 7 and 8, .Pitt’s Bureau of
Retail Training sponsored its semi-
annual Store Operations Clinic on

V the 19th floor of the Cathedral.

' The Clinic was under the super-
 ’ {vision of Professor Albert B. Smith,
D V’ Jr., senior fellow in management
a’ research and Professor Bishop
’: Brown, director of the bureau. It
» convened Tuesday morning at 9:30
p .o’clock and ended at 4 o’clock on
 .. Wednesday. .
According to Professor Brown,
 this clinic was the most successful
‘ ever conducted. A number of im-
portant phases of retailing were
 discussed. The representatives
 emphasized the necessity of doing
7 abetter selling job in the stores.
 They realized that department,
, ,, stores ‘face the shortcomings of
   younger and less experienced em-
’ ' ployees as well as shortages in
merchandise brought about by the
 war. . » i
__ 4 ' Highlight of the conference was
 the speech delivered by ‘Mr. Earl
A <¥.VV. Elhart, "director of the Fairchild

I.’ In another talk, Mr. I. D. Wolf,
J ‘(vice president of Kaufmann’s De-

How well we remember that warm
autumn evening six months ago
when, with barracks bags slung over
our shoulders, we stepped from the
train and gazed for the ﬁrst time
upon the city of Pittsburgh.

After having endured life on
the Texas deserts for countless.
-months, the Smokey Cityseemed _
to us the next thing to paradise.
And our expectations were not to
be unrealized. We can sincerely
say that our experience in Pitts-
burgh has been an unforgettable
one-—one of the most wonderful
we have ever bad. It’s all been
like a dream, and now that it is
over, we ﬁnd it almost impossible
to fully express our appreciation
to the people of Pittsburgh who
accepted us almost as their own.

-We'd like to reserve special
thanks for the YMHA, for because
of its proximity to the University,
its numerous recreational facilities,
and its informal, home-like atmos-

phere, ittook a greater role in AST
life than any similar organization.
The weekly Sunday breakfast and
afternoon dances always brightened

Also, to the ‘Masonic club and a
Variety Club USO we owe a debt

Panhellenic Skote Clears
$lOO.for China Relief

Well, it's over now. There wern’t
too many spills, just enough to
make life interesting, and every-
one who put on rollers at’Panhel-
lenic Skate vouches that a swell
time was had by all.

Panhellenic Council, is happy;
their ﬁrst trial with all the women’s
fraternities sharing equal respon-
sibility turned out successfully. Ap-
proximately $100 a was cleared for
the China War Relief Fund, more
than Doris Kalmenson, C, and her
committee expected. A total of more
than 300 tickets was sold. ’

of gratitude for many of our
most pleasant hours in Pittsburgh.
The hostesses were charming and
attractive, and were most instru-
mental in making these organiza-
tions as popular as they were.
(The many AST marriage certiﬁ-
cates and engagementrings are
perhaps indicative of this.)

More than a few’ pairs of socks
would_ still have holes in the big
toe ifit hadn’t~-been for the gener-
ous efforts of the HAWVS Women to
afford us every possible comfort and
convenience- Their kindness was
typical ‘of the Pitt-sburgher’s atti-
tude. ‘ 3

Well, our barracks bags are

packed—and ‘as’ we sling them ‘over .

our shoulders once again, we take
with us some of the most wonderful
memories of our_ lives. But we shall
return on a more peaceful day and
perhaps repay’ in some measure the
kindness accorded-us in the Smokey
City. So until-then, we’ll just say-

OH Fashions Steal
Spotlight Of Show

In Spring a young woman’s fancy
turns to thoughts of fashions!
Students at the University
School of Nursing saw a really

complete fashion show on Wednes-
day evening. Styles in women’s
fashions from 1780 up to present
day trends were featured.

Among the costumes modeled was
a one - hundred - year - old lavender
wedding gown. Gay outﬁts from the
90’s topped off with plumedehats and
bathing suits that were designed
NOT to show the ﬁgure quite obvi-
ously stole the show.

Narrator Jennie Umbel pointed
out that when skirts became
shorter, the necklines became low-
er. The modern ensemble was se-
lected from the Wardrobe Shop
on Craig street, and the 1944 cos-
tume was represented by the uni-
form of the cadet nurse.

The show was sponsored by the
traditions committee of the School
of Nursing, and faculty members,
parents of the students, and friends
were invited to attend. There were
piano selections by E. J . Bently and
M. Whitney and solos by L. Olander
