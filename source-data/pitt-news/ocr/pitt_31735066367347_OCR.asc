. Library Receives Collections

011 Anthropology, Government

The University Library has recently received several
gifts, which include donations of personal libraries by three

‘ faculty members.

Dr. George Murdock, professor of anthropology, has
donated over 3,000 books and serial publications covering
the entire ﬁeld of anthropology.

Over 500 books and government‘

documents, including biographies,
histories of business, and fiction,
have been donated by Dr. Robert
Weidenhammer, professor of ii-
nance in Business Administration.
Dr. Adolf Grunbaum, pro-
fessor of philosophy of science,
has given the library a collection
of 160 books mainly from the
period of the l920’s and l930’s.

These works of German and
European politics during the rise
oi? Hitler are very rare today and
difficult to obtain. Dr. Grun-
baum’s collection also includes
several Libretti pieces of music
which are the accompanying liter-
ature to operas.

The most unusual of the recent
donations is a total of 323 manu-
scripts; the Sheldon papers, from
a mid nineteenth century Utopian
movement called the Kiantone Ex-
periment.

These manuscripts are charac-

_t,~ristic of the Humanistic move-.

lHedges: KiilsiwFirst

Deer of Season

Jim Hedges, Arts sr., killed the
,.i‘irst deer of the season (which
begins Dec. 1) last Monday.

While Jim and his father, Jos-
eph Hedges, University procter,
were driving on route 80 from
their home in Holiday Park to the
University, a group of deer ran
onto the highway in front of their
car.

Hedges was able to avoid a
buck and three doe, but ran head-
on into the fourth doe.

While Hedges was sorry about
the deer, he was a little disturbed
about the $40 damage done to the
car. Just prior to the accident,
the same part of the car was re-
paired that was damaged by the

impact of the 125 pound deer.

To Appear in Poetry Anthology

Works of 3 Students Published

Three original poems, written
by University students, have been
selected for publication by the Na-
tional Poetry Association. The
pieces will appear in this year’s
edition'of the Annual Authology
of College Poetry.

“C’est La Vie,” by Barbara Jean
Bruder, “Memoir On Campus,” by
Victor Prestegiacomo and “Trea-
tise,” by Ed Roberson have been
selected from poems submitted
from every section of the coun-
try.

Barbara Jean Bruder is a grad-
uate of Grove City College. This
is the first material she has had
published nationally. A member
of Pi Gamma Mu, National Social
Science Honorary, Miss Bruder is
now working on her M.A. in Eng-
lish. She is also presently a stu-
dent assistant in English.

The poetry of ,Victor Preste-
giacomo will be making its sec-
ond consecutive appearance in
the Annual Anthology. Last
year, as an English project, he

wrote, “Eternityo," which was
later published. As a senior in
Secondary Education, Prestegia-
como has no deﬁnite plans for
continuing his writing career.
Ed Roberson is a sophomore in
the School of Liberal Arts. He is
on the staff of Ideas and Figures

entists in each of about 12 basic
health ﬁelds, projections of such
supply and demand for the next
10 to 20 years, and recommenda-
tions as to how the increased
demand for these scientists may
be met.

 l  Useless Persuit     —»

If anyone wishes to wastetime at the University, he can
ﬁnd many useless activities and projects. Most noteworthy
of these is ﬂoat—building, traditionally a part of Homecoming
Weekend. Every Fall, hundreds of Greeks don’ their sweat-
shirts and dungarees, and begin hours of work, bending
chicken wire, painting, and playing with paper-mache.

Fraternityand sorority funds are spent, classes are cut,

   
 
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
     
   
   
   
 
  
  
  
  
 
   
   
 
    

is completed a few minutes before the half-hour parade and
torn down immediately afterwards. The more fortunate
groupsreceive a bright shiny cup for their trophy case.

Inter-‘Fraternity Council proposed at last week’s meet-
ing that ﬂoat-building be discontinued because of the time,
money and energy necessary for such a project. In its

. place they suggested thatthe competition be on the basis
7 of house fronts.‘

Front-building, theoretically, could“ retain the “spirit”
that the ﬂoats give to Homecoming, and at the same time
would be less work and less expensive, members of Inter-
Fraternity Council felt.

,

A 4 But with competition strong among Greek groups,
 front-building will eventually become as elaborate as ﬂoat-
building, and it will be the same old story.

So while lFC’s proposal is an admirable attempt, in all
probability it will not alleviate the problem.

This motion will soon come before student government
for approval. Members of the Senate should recognize that
front-building is not a solution, but just a change that will
produce the same wasteful effects as ﬂoatbuilding.

_ They should consider whether or not these frills that
L take students away from more vital matters ‘are even neces-
tsary for a successful Homecoming. ‘We doubt that they are.

I Letters to the Editor

Polish Coed Disputes
Communist Lecturer

As a Polish citizen concerned ~

about the American conception
of Poland, having read the Pitt
News account of Dr. Grzegorz
L e o p o 1 d Seidler’s statements
concerning education and poli-
tics in Poland, I must clarify
many statements he made and
make it clear that they do not
express either the true situation
in Poland or the feeling of Pol-
ish people.

In the ﬁrst place," no Polish
patriot would call the occupants
of his country “friendly neigh-
bors . . . deeply dedicated to

world peace.” But then, no Pole V

dedicated to the ideals of free-
dom for. which our people stand
would be in the position of Rec-
tor and Political Science’ Profes-
sor in a Communist-controlled
coiintry. '

According to Dr. Seidler,
member of the Polish Commu-
nist Party's Central Committee‘
for Education, the party does not
maintain any controls over his
school.

What more control could a‘
party have than to have their
member as Rector of the univer-
sity? Or what is even more ob:
vious, as a political science in-
structor? Or to pay for the in-
stitution? Or to evaluate its pro-
gram every three years? Com-
mon sense would tell anyone who
had never seen Poland that a
political science professor would
believe that the university “can-
not be concerned with political,
social, or governmental disputes,
but only technological ad-
vances.”

Having attended Polish schools
for ten years I am only too
aware that they not only are
concerned with political matters,
but. that they exercise so much
control in these matters as to
ch_ange names, for example, of
scientists to Russian ones, to re-
quire all students to learn Rus-
sian, to teach ‘that only the
Communist way is good. I had to
learn two. history courses — the
fictitious one taught by the
Communists in the schools and
then another, the truethistory,

from my family.  . y . l,

 

 
  

are always free . . .” His con-
ception, however, of a “free’
election is far from the Ameri-
can ideal.

I witnessed on of these “free”
elections in which the Commu-
nists wanted to make it so clear
that it was “free” that they
went around in taxis and forced
everyone out of their homes,
even taking people from sick-

. beds, to go to the polls. There

at the polls the “voter” picked
up a paper with the name of the
candidate on it and under the
close scrutiny of the police drop-

ped the “ballot” into the ballot-
box, without ever marking a line
or» an X or any other indication
of choice on it.

To this Dr. Seidler might re-
ply that this election was during
Stalin’s era," that now it is dif-
ferent, that Polish elections are
“just as in the United States,
with the names of several par-
ties and candidates on the bal-
lots?” A

As a student deeply concern-
ed about“ the political situation
in my country, it is strange that
I was not aware (nor are‘ any
of my family now)- of the exist-
ence of “several parties” in P0-
land.. On the contrary, I __.was
taught that there is only line
party — the Communist Party

— which expresses the ideas of

all the people.

As an example of the blatant
lies typical of this man’s report
we have the statement that we
have no “little, red railroad

cars” in Poland (referring to the A

streetcars). I traveled every day
to school ‘in Polish streetcars
(and they are red, too, by the
way). i

Dr. Seidler’s speeches at Pitt
serve as a good example for Pitt
students to observe. A good ex-
a m p l e, that is, of Communist
propaganda and the fact that
they cannot under any circum-
stances be trusted. Any Pitt stu-
dents hearing his lectures should
‘bear this fact in mind — that he
is speaking for the Communists

~ and not for the Polish people,
_ _ allot whom are crying for free-
I dom. V ' - . , .

Mr. Warren Ashburn’s recent

 Penn Statell ands cats Worst Loss

9‘.

I Lions ran the ball for two points
V and a 14-3 victory.

Last Period

. Overcome '3 - 0 Lead

By JACK

For three quarters it appeared as though the Panthers
were headed toward a respectable season. A fourth quarter
full of Panthers miscues resulted in a 14-3 win for Penn State,
as the Cats slumped to their worst record since ’57, when
they won four and lost six. Their record stands this year at

a mediocre , 4,-3-3. 9

But scribes and Panther hope-

fuls will quickly point to the Blue '

and Gold schedule which has been
one of the roughest in the nation.
They will also point to the close
games both tied and lost. How-
ever, the 4-3=3 record still stands.

There were eight seniors: Mike
Ditka, Ron Delfine, Jim Cunning-
ham, Chuck Reinhold, Fritz Walk-
er, Dick Mills, Ed Fornadel and
Paul Hodge; each one went into
the game with only one thought,
“We wanted to win the State
game more than any other,” Ditka
said. ,

Both ‘Teams Threaten

For the ﬁrst threequarters it
appeared as though the Panthers
might have‘ won it. Until the
fourth quarter they held a 3-0
edge on Fred Cox’s 35-yard ﬁeld
goal in the opening minutes of
play. Both teams threatened often
but drives were nipped before
they could cause_any damage.

The Pa.nther’s pass defense
reached its usual peak as_ State
scored both touchdowns in the

‘ fourth quarter on passes.

Lion touchdowns came on pass-
es of three and (30 yards. On
State’s ﬁrst touchdown pass the
Panthers were caught for having
too many men on the ﬁeld. The
penalty was refused and State led
6-3. After the second TD, the

Hard Loss
“We moved well until we got
inside their 20-yard line,” Quar-
terback_ Ed Sharockman said.
“Then we weren’t able to come
up with the big play to carry us
farther. As long as we are inside
our own 20 We are strong both on
offense and defense.”
“Not coming up with the big
.play has been the story of our
season,” said Delﬁne. “It’s hard
to take a loss like this when
you're a senior.”
Panther senior tackle Dick

Mills, however, credits the Lions
with outstanding play. “They had
a tough team,” Mills said. “You
can’t take that away from them.
They pla ed hard and rough like

Passing Edge
“Our line play was better than
theirs,” said guard Paul Hodges,
“but we letthefn out of the bag
once too often.” .

State led in running with 217
yards to the Panthers 157. The
Panthers, however, held a slight
edge in passing yardage, 78-63
and ﬁrst downs 17-15.

‘Ditka, already rated by th e
coaches across the nation as an
All-American, played the game
equal to his rating, according to
Coach John Michelosen. The sen-
ior from Aliquippa played the en-
tire second half of the game with
a shoulder separation.

second quarter of Saturday’s 14-3 loss to Penn State. Jim Cun-

W ms Yogi

The Yogi season came to an
abrupt halt this week as once
again Jack (Scoop) Smith led the
prognosticators with a 9-5 reoord
and coasted to the Yogi Cham-
pionship.

Scoop has led the yogis since
the ﬁrst week and ﬁnished the
season with a 98-40 record, 12
better than his closest competitior,
the player, who ended the seasonﬁ
at 86-52. ‘

The female and Marshall Ro-
meo ended in a tie for third, the
coach was ﬁfth and Ted Col-
ton held up the-rest of the yogi
from the bottom spot which he
has clung to all season.

“There have been many thrill-
ing moments in guessing this sea-'
son.” Scoop Smith related. “My
worst guess was that Syracuse
would beat Pitt. However, I made .
upfor it this week when I picked »
Penn State’s paper over the Pitt
News.”

On the other end of the yogi
race Ted Colton commented,
“Smith lead all the way but any
one who would pick Syracuse to
beat his own team doesn’t deserve

 

allgother tate teams.”

to be the top picker.”

Penn State Falls in Overtime

Smith, Leads Boaters to 2-1 Win

By JOHN FLEMING
For the booters to cop a 2-1
victory over Penn State, it took

a determinted Panther team ef-
fort in the season’s ﬁnale on the
Practice Field Saturday.

The Panthers did all of their
scoring within three mintues.
With one minute left to play, it
looked» like the .Nittany Lions
would again beat the Blue and
Gold. However, 15 seconds later
the tide turned. .

Pete Smith and Cork)’ Cum‘
bert, the Panthers’ sophomore
scoring punch, teamed up to tie
the game at one apiece. Smith
took a short pass from Cuthbert
to tally with only 45 seconds re-
*maining to play.

Late Scoring ,

.In the ﬁrst two minutes of the
initial overtime period, this same
sophomore scoring punch clicked
again. Cuthbert passed from the
wing to Smith who scored the
winning goal. ‘

Both teams were late in scor-

ing. The lone goal for the Lions .

“The boys did a terriﬁc job of

pulling together after the injuried
returned to action,” said Coach
Leo Bemis. “After losing ﬁve in a
row, they came back to win three
and tie one in their ‘last four
games.” The booters ﬁnal ledger
for this season reads 5-5-1. '
Cats Lose Seven

Seven seniors, who command
almost all the Cats defensive
power, played their last soccer
game for the Golden Panthers.
All—American goalie “Zeke” Zani-
copoulos, fullback Ron Prado, and
halfbacks Cal Smith, Bob Mc-
Nulty and Carl Templin will be
missing from the defensive unit.

The Panthers will lose Bob

Collegiians
Win Blood
Bowl, 34-8

1 Johnny Black
Leads Cowards
To Easy Win
For the third straight year
the Pitt News Hawks have not
been able to defeat the mighty
Cowards of the Penn State
Daily Collegian. In the early

morning dew last Saturday
the Hawks went down to a crush-
ing 34-8 defeat.

The Cowards came up with a
tremendous passer in. Johnny
Black and three capable receivers
who were able to get behind the
Hawks defense. ' ,

For the third year in a row,
Black was the outstanding Cow-
ard player. Saturday he threw
ﬁve TD passes and ran for a two
point conversion.

The News Hawks on the -other
hand could not come up with
anybody who could match

Black's aerial supremacy. On

the ﬁrst play of the game, Jim

O’Brien, News Hawk tailback,

threw 3 10118 pass to Chuck

Dunbar but Black was “Johnny

on the spot” as he intercepted _

it. From there the Cowards
marched for a quick score and
made the two point convsrsion.
_The Pitt News came back to
tie. the score 8-8 with O’Brien
going around left end for the
touchdown. But after that the
Hawks were never in the ball
game.

Hawks Coach Ted Colton said,
“We wanted to win this one but
I guess they were too good for
us. We missed our ace passer Ron
Maser. If he "had been in our
backﬁeld it might have been a
different story.” v

Maser was injured last Tues-
day when he was leading Varsity
Hall to the IM championship. He
had 12 stitches put in the face
and, was not able to suit up for
the Blood Bowl.
