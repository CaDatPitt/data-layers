Lifted Oil Embargo Explored P‘Hecl<led John Bircher

‘BY MATTHEW KAMBIC

Government, economic, and oil
corporation authorities expressed
differing views on the effects of
Tuesday's lifting of the Arab oil
embargo against the US.

Seven of the nine oil producing
nations dropped the embargo citing
the United States for assuming “a

. position which is more compatible

with the principle of what is right
and just toward the Arab-occupied
territories and the legitimate rights
of the Paiestinian people.” ' I

The White House was‘ silent on
the matter, according to The New
York Times, partly because the
lifting had been anticipated and
also because the official statement
said nothing about increases in the
production of crude oil.

The Times reported, 7 “The
amount of oil the US will get from
the lifting of the embargo. now
depends on the extent to which
Arab countries, and especially
Saudi Arabia, the biggest- oil
exporter in the vworld, "increase
their output.”

Spokesman for Gulf Oil Corpora-
tion Sherri Zippay said, America
had been producing oil at an 82%
capacity during the embargo, and
this figure would obviously be
expected to rise with the end of the
embargo. She said, “It
will take between six and eight
weeks before ‘we can return to
maximum refining capacity [14
million barrels a day.] Consump-
tion ofoil is at 16 million barrels a

Tuition,” Cost Rise

The causes of tuition and cost
increases at state colleges and
universities will be investigated by
Pennsylvania House and Senate
members in joint-committee hear-
ings in Monroeville, March 29.

The committee, comprised of six
State Representatives and six State
Senators, is studying the problem
of increasing costs and tuition in
order to take proper legislative
action, according to Representative
Fieber Pencost, Chairman of the
House Education Committee.

According to recent newspaper
accounts, the national average
tuition increase at public institu-
tions jumped 3.6% last. year for
in-state students and 10.4% for

- out-of-state students.

“Nationwide, we have the
highest tuition rates for state
colleges ($750/year) and universi-
ties ($1,000/year),” Pencost said.
"The opportunity for higher
education should be made available
to every deserving, person. The

day, l and was at 20 before‘ it
was checked by certain factors.”
The Times listed these factors as

. warmer than* usual weather in the

US this winter, a slowdown in
industrial growth rates, oil conser-
vation programs, and some resis-
tance to high prices.

Pitt economics professor James
Schlesinger viewed the lifting of
the embargo as a sign of an
improved economic and political
climate: “Better economic rela-
tions around the world generate
better political relations.

“The US will immediately feel -

the effects of the lifting in that
companies will have a different
outlook in their long range

forecasts. Also, the steady inflow
[of oil] may find prices decreas-
ing,” Schlesinger said. —

Zippay, however, forsees possi-
ble price increases. “With
imported crude costing more than
domestic crude, an increase in gas
prices can’ be expected." Zippay
said Gulf feels mandatory alloca-
tions of fuels should be removed.
“Industry can do a better job of
allocating than the government.”

Schlesinger said the Arabs. used
the embargo to show some power.
“The Arabs realized that their
welfare rests on the sale of oil. not
on keeping it., It‘s the same
principle as holding gold--it doesn't
do you any good unless you use it.”

BAS Deputy Candidates

BY BILL HADUCK

Bringing the organization -to the
people, establishing good man-
agement, and initiating better
relations with the administration
are a few of the positions
candidates have taken in the race
for Black Action Society (BAS)
deputy chairmanﬁ George Van
Hook, Joey Fuller, and Steve
Daniels are the candidates for
BAS’s second highest office.

Van Hook senses a gap in the
organization that should be closed.
“Currently, I think there’s a wide
breach between the officers of the
BAS and the people they’re
supposed to be serving.

“The basic issue in the whole
campaign, Ifeel, is that the people
Leaders
thrust down policies on thepeople
normally without consulting them
and there isn’t really any constant
flow of ideas between the rank and
tile. My specific policy would be to
facilitate this ﬂow of communica-
tion.

“A lot of people are afraid of
BAS ofﬁcers. They feel they’re
very high "up or something. I
decided to run because I felt a
leader would have to be a person
the people could trust and could
have the rapport the person would
need toget the peoples’ ideas. I
feel 1 have rapport with the black
students on campus.”

Van Hook said he wanted to
institute a new system of liason
officers or BAS represeritatives.
“They would be in charge of taking
anything discussed at the general

body meetings or. 0 confmittee.

Joey,Fuller, BAS deputy chair-
man 1972-73, said she doesn’t‘have

“What I see the deputy

Forsees Communist Coup 

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

Speaking about the threat of a
Communist takeover of the United
States, Robert Welch, founder and
director of the radical right wing
John Birch Society, was jeered and
laughed at by students Monday
night in David Lawrence Hall.

Welch’s speech consisted en-
tirely of excerpts from his famous
1958 speech in Indianapolis precip-
itating the founding of the John

' En-‘ch Society. / _
The speech was marked by

occasional laughter" from the
audience which became more vocal
when, replying to a question
following the speech, .Welch

‘described the Women Liberation

Movement as “a plot dreamed up
by the Communists to remove the

woman from -her "pedestal and .
.further subvert society." .
The crowd's response caused

Welch to cut short the question and
answer portion of the program.

“I've spoken at colleges up and
down the east and west coasts and

_ this is the second most impolite

audience I have ever met,” Welch
said.

At a news conference held earlier '

in the Student Union, Welch said
President Nixon will serve out his
term of office. “Mr. Nixon has a
very thick skin and he is very
ambitious. I doubt if he’ll resign
and I don’t think he will be
impeached.”

“We've always been an oppo-
nent of Richard Nixon. ‘He and
William F. Buckley have done more
to destroy the John Birch Society
than anyone else.”

Welch said Watergate was

American society and of the corrupt

Study Reveals Disturbed

By JOHN BRONSON
Associated Press Writer

To the American people, the
energy crisis is simply another grab
for a buck, the latest in a series of
reasons to be angry and frustrated,
a Pitt study shows.

An overwhelming 82% of 585
persons responding to a Pitt survey
said they were dissatisﬁed with
general conditions in America
today. And 55% said life would not
improve by 1976.

“First we have Watergate, then

director of Pitt's Center for Urban

....., _...:.:..-

“If we had only the energy crisis
to deal with, I'm sure the responses
would be much more optimistic,"
he said. “But the level of
frustration comes not so much from
the lack of gasoline as from the
energy situation’s connection to a
much larger national crisis.”

“This becomes absolutely clear
in the written comments at the end
of the energy survey where most
people mention Watergate and the
notion that we have to cleanse our
political system,” Nehnevajsa said.

Nothing to Do? Dial-on—Activity*"*

BY DAN DEELY

Code-a-Phone, a system of calling
the University to find out the
week's events. is expected to be
initiated this week on a trial basis.
Student Government President
Mike Furick announced.

Similar to Dial-the-Weather, the
caller will instead get a message

listing University-sponsored spea-
kers, concerts and other events

over a week’s period, in a taped
phone message.

Student Government Program-
ming Chairman Chuck Braverman
said the new system would
probably be socially oriented,
giving taped messages of times and
places for all scheduled events and
for certain meetings.

“I think it's a way a student can
call in to get information on
activities and ‘he won’t be

Pedestrian Bridge Plan

Joins Dorms, Law School

BY RALPH HAURWITZ

A pedestrian bridge to be built
from the Towers dormitories across
Forbes Avenue 20 feet in the air
will eventually connect the resi-
dence halls with David Lawrence
Hall and the buildings planned for
the Forbes Avenue construction
site. according to Director of the
Physical Plant Hunt Martin.

“At first," said Martin. “it will
be a bridge to nowhere. in that it
will connect only to the Law School,
which should be completed late in
1975. There will also be stairs
running from the bridge to the
sidewalk in front of Lawrence Hall,
enabling students to go from the
Towers to the other side of Forbes

via the bridge." A

Construction of the‘; bridge will
begin sometime during the sum-
mer of 1975, Martin said. although
the connection to Lawrence Hall
will not be completed until early in
1977. when the Quadrangle project
is finished.

Buildings presently under con-
struction along Forbes Avenue
include Pitt’s new Law School
Building and the new Professional
Quadrangle, which will house the
School of Education, the School of
Social Sciences, and the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs [GSPIA].

Braverman said.

When the idea was originally
discussed Furick said, “We ran
intothe objection that we'd be
providing free advertising. The
way I feel about it is that the
service we’re providing outweighs
the objection of advertising."

The Student Government has
invited all University organizations
to use the system. Request forms
necessary to submit messages are
available in 305 SU. The message
should be in at least one week prior
to the scheduled event.

Furick said the system looks
promising “because of the size of
the campus the students have
trouble keeping up with all of
what's happening. This way a
student can call a dozen times a day
if he forgets to keep himself
informed. ‘

“We'll eliminate the students
excuse of ‘I’d like to have gone to
something, but I didn't know about
it.‘ The student doesn’t have to
walk anywhere for information"
just call.

“We hope to just try out the
mechanics of it now and use it next
fall on a regular basis. The unit we
have now is cheaper than what
we’ll use next fall,” Furick said.

The present system is capable of
handling only‘ one call at a time.
Next fall's system, however, will be
able to handle ﬁve calls at once.

plans to implement strategy which

will improve his image among

American minority groups.
A As a result Nixon has scheduled a
token appearance at the White
House for someday next week. He
and his invited guests. which
include Strom Thurmond and
Lester maddox. will participate in
an Al Jolsen Film Festival.

“An Evening With" Minorities"
will also include Charlie Chan
flicks, John Wayne movies, and

(reruns of the Bill DAna Show.

Nixon rejected a speaking engage-
ment at the harlem Press Club
because the First Lady is suffering
from inﬂuenza. The report quotes
the President as saying, “I'm ‘not

Once President Nixon has im-
proved his relations with the

efforts on the youth of America.

averted when Henry Kissinger
informed the President that he
could wear his American flag pin
on his left sock.

The President will answer all

questions from newsmen during ‘

his streak. However, as a public
service, only radio coverage of this
event will be allowed.

According to the classified report
President Nixon lives in constant
fear of being kidnapped by a
terrorist group. Recently, a plot by
the HJC (House Judiciary Com-
mittee) was uncovered.

Informed sources state Peter
Rodino, Field Marshall of the HJC,
intended to hijack the Presidential
limousine and drive Nixon to
Capitol Hill for questionning.

The plot failed when Rodino
hijacked the wrong car. However,
the limousine's occupant, King
Timahoe, the President's dog,
testified against his former'boss
and provided the HJC _with
valuable information regarding
Nixon's improper behavior.

The President is afraid his secret
plan will be nagated once Tima-
hoe's testimony becomes public.
According to the report Nixon has
said, “Timmy and l were the only
livingcreatures who knew all the
truth. Now that Timmy has
become a turncoat, who will defend
me in court? I1 will not let the
Presidency go to the dogs.“

But, Nixon's future depends on
his own ability to execute the plan.
The report reveals the President is
prepared for the worst. lt was for
this reason he recently dispatched
Pat to South America to scout sites
for a home in exile.

For the past few months Nixon
has attempted to buoy the spirits of
his distraught family. At their last

Dear Editor:

Two letters by Kurt Olsen and Lee
Moses published in the Pitt News,
issue of Monday, March 11, 1974;
portrayed utter naivete on the part
of the writers of such letters.

The writers showed that they are
victims of the racist ideas they are
trooping out to defend. Otherwise,
how could a student who claims to
be astute, knowledgeable and
responsible rave and rant over an
attack against subjection of stu-
dents to racist ideas that have been
historically demonstrated and
known (supposedly known also by
Kurt and Lee since they claim
tremendous intelligence) to be
inimieal, prejudicial, and distor-
tional to real human historical
progress?

These super students of bourgeois
democracy showed their state of
bondage. Otherwise, how can they
raise the slogan of academic
freedom when the academic
content of the book under attack is
a scheme for elimination of human
freedom?

  ‘Love Me...I’m President’

impeachment. And if it fails,
Simon has given me his word there
will be enough fuel for the
Presidential jet. Surely, Uncle
Leonid will grant asylum if
everybody else rejects us."

The report concludes by con-
ﬁrming a story printed in Playboy
magazine. Spiro Agnew is
preparing a reorientation package
for Nixon to assist the President in
his transition from public servant to
civilian just in case the secret plan
does not exist. ‘

These students who are pissed off
about banning a textbook that

' propagates forced sterilization and

decimation of oppressed peoples of
the world forget that the students
selecting the
textbook. So, what do these
students mean when they chant
their‘ academic freedom slogan?
They also forget that a textbook is
not the same as a reading list.

Coffman, the teacher of the text
argued in March 8th Pitt News that
the book is ‘the only comprehen-
sive book of the ‘human ecology”‘.
At the same time he stated that
“The book proceeds from the
assumption the world is over
populated and ,something must be
done to resolve the demographic
crisis.“ ’how can a book that starts
off with a false, onesided and
reactionary assumption be the most
comprehensive in ‘human eco-
lo_gy"'?

. Is it not clear the very term

‘human ecology’ already involves
two categories that embrace
relationally the totality of society
i.e., humanity and environment.

Obviously any assumption that
isolates one aspect in order to label
it is not only limiting the subject
matter but maliciously misdirecting
people’s focus. So, the assertion
that the world is overpopulated
must be attended with the
question; relative to what? And
when one asks that question, the
distortion of reality is unmasked for
it becomes clear that such an
assumption is totally meaningless
though dangerous. One grasps the
totality in actual plain reality that
the only correct assumption that
can adequately deal comprehen-

sively with the issue of ‘human.

ecology’ is that there is a
discrepancy between world popula-
tion and utilization of world
resources, which boils down to

stating that there is a problem with

the mode of production which is the
crux of social being.

Although this contradiction may
manifest itself to some as over-
population it is erroneous to take

         Letterto the Editor
On Death and Dying,

.’f‘. . _Govemor Shapp should resist the pressure tactics of the State
 ’ Legisture, hold ﬁrm to his convictions, and veto this week House Bill
S 1060, which would reinstate the death penalty in Pennsylvania.

_ Any death penalty bill should be vetoed by a sitting executive
7 because neither a legislature nor a court can ever reasonably sit in
, _judgement over another individual’s life. Although it has been said
’ many times, murder, including murder done by jurisdiction of a
'1 “legitimate state” can never be justiﬁed.

this superﬁciality as a basic
assumption if even we have to
accept assumption in the place of
objective reality that is clear to the
working people. When objective
reality is replaced by false
assumption, the condition and
character of service rendered
becomes a crucial issue.

But Charles Ralph, Biology
Department Chairman resolved the
issue when he stated in the same
Pitt News article: “We want to be
sure the rights of professors are
protected in terms of his right to
select what he thinks is the best
textbook, and the right to present
ideas no matter how unpalatable

’ they are to the community.”

No surprise, once these professors
are at ease with anti-community
false assumptions they should be
expected to consistantly denigrade
the community’s interests, ideas,
knowledge, and welfare. Anti-
community academics is surely
palatable but only to those who, by

their objective position in the
community as ‘oppressors and
exploiters are anti-community.

It is clear, therefore, that

responsible academis demands
rephrasing Charles Ralph’s state-
ment to read, “We want to be sure
the rights of a professor are
protected in terms of his rights to
select what he thinks is the best
textbook, and the right to present
ideas no matter how unpalatable
they are to the rulers and
oppressors of the community.

These conscious students, mostly
sons and daughters of exploited
and oppressed working people do
not harbor or encourage bourgeois
illusions about academic freedom.
To us academic freedom means
freedom of knowledge or truth.
And since the university is
essentially the institution for the
working out and propagation of the
truth, we shall make all efforts to
establish and nourish this essence
in the interests and genocidal
ideas.

The line is already drawn no
matter what. capitalist in the
interest of thepeople irrespective
of the rulers‘ temporary in
subjecting the university to the
service of their greedy interests
and mouthpieces among the
students and faculty think. Similar
forces would hail free enterprise
(by which they mean the freedom
of employers to exploit workers)
when workers demand higher
wages; they would shout “totalita-
rianism" when the public demand
air pollution measures, against
corporations.

We need no more racist lies and
distortions cramped down our
throat under any disguise, law, or
‘academic freedom’ slogan. We

« have least needlfor fascist ideas to

befog our minds whether they
come from colonialist circles of
Rhodesia, [where Boughey was a
professor] or bourgeois cliques in
America. . F

We recognize and resist these
poisonous ideas even though
ringed around with the slogan of
‘academic freedom‘ and cajoling
insinuation of ‘little honest scholar-
ship.‘ _

The presumptuous nodding is

‘over. The test is in public action

not in the ante-chamber of a few
dozing taciturns such as Kurt
Olsen, Lee Moses. and professors
who rudely wake up to howl at the
advance of progress.

Sincerely,

Anugo Ntukogu

fessor in the Department of Black
Education, Research, and Develop-
ment]

Travel Chariot Wins Honors

BY LARRY PANSINO

Greek Week's winning chariot

air-travel theme, was taken Mon-
day by the Greek team of Delta
Sigma Chi, Triangle, and Delta
Delta Delta.

Contrasting 19th century air-tra-
vel, one hemisphere depicted a

hot-air balloon aﬂoat above the
streets of Paris with the slogan
“Around the World in 80 Days”
emblazoned above. The other half
showed a model of Skylab in orbit
and the message ‘fAround the
World in 80 Minutes.”

Chariots were judged both on
design and performance in the race

a major construction effort, which ‘
Jay Roling, assistant to the Vice

Chancellor of Public Affairs, called
“the largest project of its kind ever
attempted by the .General State
Authority."

This project also includes con-
struction of the new buildings,
relocation of Sennott Street, which
now runs behind Lawrence Hall
and Hillman Library, and con-
struction of a pedestrian mall
between Hillman and Lawrence, at
what is now Pennant Street.

“Sennott will be relocated to_
behind the Quadrangle complex
upon its completion," Roling said.
“The new street will hook onto
Schenley Drive in the vicinity of the
Frick Fine Arts Building and enter
into a parking and service entrance
under the new building."

Four 70's Novels:

(“During the Livingston rodeo, a
gopher and a rattlesnake had faced

shadows of the 'Absarokas. Only
the snake had been able to pay

Piano relates the adventures of
Nicholas Payne--his motto is “Non

shows a snake dragging his heels.
The individualistic Payne comes
into conflict with his girlfriend's
conventional parents. Payne, in his
Hudson Hornet, follows his girl-
friend's family from Michigan to
their ranch in Montana. Payne also
_ioins up with C..I. Clovis. a multiple
amputee who wants to build bat
towers.

Elaborate prose and perceptive
social criticism ﬁlls McGuane‘s
novel. -Typical is his observation of
how the West of the Indians now
belongs to the unappreciative rich.
The book's ﬁner. qualities are
tarnished by McGuane‘s weak
characterizations and lack of
sympathy for minor characters.

‘Swing A Man On,’ or...

M BY M.C. PILECKI
Some movies deﬁnitely have
identity problems. ‘
They start in one direction, stop,
shuffle around, then veer off in a
completely new direction. And so
you spend half the time just trying
to figure out what it is, an activity
that is not going to add to one's
enjoyment.
That's the

one of primary

problems with Man on a Swing,_

billed as a whodunnit although it
comes off as a whatizzit. The basic
story. gleaned from actual police
ﬁles, is that of a self-proclaimed
clairvoyant foisting his services to
the stymied cops in a clueless
murder case.

It sounds like a good idea. and
coming from a documented case
makes it sound even better. But
the movie hedges around it. The
ﬁlm starts off with the police
detective (Cliff Robertson) becom-
ing absorbed in the personalities of
the case, especially the attractive
victim. 50 at first it looks like this
is yet another film about the
detective investigating a young
woman's murder and falling in love
with her.

But the necrophiliac theme is
droppedcalmost as soon as i_t starts
to gel. Then it goes onto the cop’s
home life and the problems caused
by his excessive devotion to duty.
One starts to wonder how his wife
ever became pregnant.

And then, long after the story
should have been revved up and
moved on, is the central character
introduced, practically through a
back door. Joel_Grey, in his second
flick (the first was his Oscar-win-'

ning role in Cabaret). is rather
birdlike and often overly fussy in
his portrayal of the alleged
clairvoyant. as though he couldn't
quite shake his earlier movie role.

But. to be fair, Grey is pretty
good at the abrupt switches of the
trances he assumes when he
attempts to solve the crime by
entering the spirit of the killer. The
twitching, the screaming, the
egotism and the way he throws
himself around a room in his
“trances" is, paradoxically. quite
believable of a clairvoyant and
dramatically important while also
being inappropriately amusing to
an average audience.

Cliff Robertson has the unfor-
tunate job of running around trying
to play reality juxtaposedtto Grey’s
mystic. He ends up looking mostly
stern and always overly suspicious
of the persistent Grey, even though
his suspicions are given little base.

The restraint on Robertson, and
indeed the entire film. is that of
adhering too close to the facts of
the case and forsaking dramatic
possibilities. Director Frank Perry
and screenwriter David Zelag
Goodman seemed more interested
in putting this highly unusual case
on the screen, rather than making
an entertaining, satisfying film.

There is too much hesitancy to
round out and interpret » the
characters and situations with the
stern third-person objective per-

' spective taken. The case is indeed

one to raise many questions about
clairvoyancy and the sincerity of its
title character, but the film leaves
more than its share of untied ends
in its refusal to interpret some of

them.

In his “Bibliographer’s Case-
book,” Field discusses inadequa-
cies of several previous bibliogra-
phies. Field has consulted
Nabokov’s own notebooks and
papers to supplement the research
he has done in places such as the
New York Public Library, the
British Museum and the Helsinki
University Library.

This deﬁnitive book accom-
plishes several ‘valuable tasks.’
Through extensive cross-referen-
ces, it does much to clear up
confusion over the titles and places
of publication of Nabokov's work by
indicating where translations have
been published and into what

languages. The book will aid
scholars in’ trying to evaluate
Nabokov's influence’ on world
literature.

Vladimir" Nabokov,i who has
written works in Russian and later
in English, is one of the finest
living writers. This book will be
useful to scholars and readers
interested in knowing more about
Nabokov’s works.

While Field's listings of foreign
translations ends in 1972, his
listings of new books extends into
the near future. New or upcoming

Nabokov books include Lolita (the

screenplay). Strong Opinions, Na-
bokov's first collection of essays
and reviews. and Tyrants Des-
troyed,—a collection of stories. This

tine book shows the diverse
interests of its subject. It is an
accurate bibliography of Vladimir
Nabokov. chess enthusiast, butter-
ﬂy expert and novelist. I

Which brings us to bibliography
entry number 0905. Transparent
Things, published in late 1972 is
Nabokov’s most recent novel. This
-wonderful, brief work covers
serious matters with a light touch.
As usual, Nabokov’s extraordinary.
prose leaves the reader groping for
superlatives.

One of the book's underlying
concepts is expressed on the first
page:

“When we concentrate on a
material ob_iect, whatever its
situation, the very act of attention
may lead to our involuntarily
sinking into the history of that
object. Novices must learn to skim
overmatter if they want matter to
stay at" the exact level of the
moment. Transparent things,
through which the past shines!...A
thin veneer of immediate reality is
spread over natural and artificial

,matter, and whoever wishes to

remain in the now, withthe now,
on the now, should please not
break its tension film. Otherwise

the inexperienced miracle-worker ‘

will find himself no longer walking
on water but descending upright
among staring fish.”

American, who revisits Switzerland
where he met his late-wife. Person’
is not an especially appealing
character but Nabokov's thorough-
ness makes him interesting. We
learn of Person's married life, his
father's death in Switzerland when
Person was a young man and his
career as an employee for a
publisher. With admirable ease,
Nabokov juggles the different time
periods of his story.

In keeping with the general tone
of the book, Nabokov is not above
poking fun at himself. A stepfather
who lusts after his beautiful young
stepdaughter is a humorous re-
minder of Nabokov's famous novel

Lolita. The writer"‘Mr. R." who »

like his creator lived in Switzer-
land. is reminiscent of Nabokov
himself.

“Mr. .R’s” writing “acquired a
shapeliness, a richness, an osten-
sible dash, that caused some of the
less demanding reviewers in his
adopted country to call him a
master stylist,” Nabokov writes.

Death and fire haunt this book.
Person, when he returns to
Switzerland cannot remember the
hotel room heistayed in years ago
with his future wife; the hotel
manager has committed suicide
and all of his records were
destroyed. Incidents like this
preﬁgure Person's own death.

Fire is the other important
recurring image. Person dreams
his house is on fire while he

accidentally strangles his wife.
Person’s’own death occurs when

his hotel is consumed in flames.

Other items and images recur.
Person, in his Swiss hotel, finds an
old magazine he had left there
‘eight years before. It contains a
piece about a man. who like
Person, had murdered his wife
1 eight years ago. '

Of more consequence is Person’s

remembrance of a childhood dream

-as he dies. On the book's last
page Nabokov writes:

“Rings of blurred colors circled
around him reminding him brieﬂy
of a childhood picture in a
frightening book about triumphant
vegetables whirling faster and
faster about a nightshirted boy
trying desperately _to'awake from
the iridescent dizziness of dream
life. Its ultimate vision was the
incandescence of a book or a box
grown completely transparent and
hollow. This is, I believe, it: not
the crude anguish of physical death

7but the incomparable pangs of the

mysterious mental maneuver
needed topass from one state of
being" to another.”

As is typical of this book, one of
its author's shortest, demonstrates
again Nabokov's ‘great talent.
Nabokov’s unique mixture __of
seriousness- and humor juxtaposes
death and satire in a perfect book
well worth reading. .

Tomorrow At Civic Arena

Panthers Set To Defend Ora wn     i

BY BART MACK
Sports Editor
It wasn't Indiana, but it didn't
make too much difference to the
Pitt Hockey Club as the Panther
skaters qualiﬁed for the Western
Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey Asso-
ciation championship to be held

tomorrow night, 9 pm at the Civic‘

Arena, by trouncing the Du-
quesne Dukes, 5-2, at Sewickley
last night. ,

Pitt made the trip down the
Ohio river fully expecting to face

Indiana but found the Dukes as '

their opponents instead. Du-

quesne won that right via its
regular performance against the
Indians. Both teams tied for third

place with 11 points but the Dukes
won the spot on their 1-0-2 record
against IUP.

The Panthers will face either
Indiana or Carnegie Mellon,
depending on the outcome of their
semiﬁnal clash. . j

The Dukes, playing without
their star defenseman C.H.
Bender, put a score ' into the

'defending champions by taking

the lead on a John Sullivan goal
with a little. more than nine
minutes gone in the first period.

«The ﬁred up Dukes put the,

pressure on league-leading goalie
Jumpin’ John DeFazio all through
the initial period with 11 shots.

Duquesne’s lead lasted all of 20
seconds before Pitt captain Denny
Browne made a sliding block on a
Duke shot at the Panther line,
sending the puck rolling at center
ice where it was picked up by
winger Rick Vernon- Flying in

Vernon blasted a slapshot from 20
feet that Duquesne goaltender
Bob Mitro never had a chance to
handle.

N.C. St. Hoops: An Obsession

‘ BY RON SIEGEL

Perhaps the greatest college basketball player in history, North
Carolina State’s David Thompson’s life could have ended Saturday
because of some over-zealous fans who happened to be the team

.physicians.

The 6-4 forward had taken off on one of his ﬂying leaps to block a
Lew Hill shot Saturday when he collided with teammate Phil Spence.
Spence stands 6-9, but Thompson had jumped so high, his feet
collided with Spence's shoulder. The result was an agonizing ﬂip that
sent the Shelby, N.C. junior crashing to the floor with the back of his

head making first contact.

The Wolfpack trainer rushed out to treat Thompson beforeplay had
been stopped. He lay unconscious for four minutes before being
wheeled away on a stretcher and taken to nearby Rex Hospital.

, The game continued, and if was soon reported that Thompson was
being X-rayed.' Later, it was announced that he hadn’t suffered any
serious injury, to the great relief of everybody in Reynolds Coliseum.

Early in the second half, Thompson reappeared, and the game had to
be stopped as the fans cheered and both teams went over to greet him.

Wearing a white bandage around his head,

the two-time

All-American appeared to be in a daze, not knowing where he was.
He should not have been brought back to Reynolds Coliseum.
Upon awakening at the hospital, Thompson sent word to his team

that he was all right, and repeatedly inquired about the score.

He received 15 stitches for the gash in his head. Doctors feared he
had broken his neck, but by lifting his head before impact, he somehow
survived with just a cerebral concussion.

After the game, Dr. James Manley was brought before the news
media to explain Thompson's condition. ’

“We decided to bring him back because of the widespread TV

exposure,” Manley said.
know how David was.”

“We knew that a lot of people wanted to

A reporter inquired if’Thompso\n had requested to return to the
game. Amazingly, Manley replied that he did not. “He didn’t object

to it though," he replied.

If I were Wolfpack head coach Norm Sloan, Manley would never

touch another N.C. State athlete.

Thompson was returned to the hospital for overnight observation,

and obviously never ‘should have left.

Even if he hadn't suffered a

head injury, how is a 19-year-old expected to know whether or not he is
medically able to leave a hospital to make an inspirational appearance

at a basketball game?

\
\

IlllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllii

Manley and the other team doctors got caught up in the absurd
“Wolfpack “Fever,” in which winning basketball games becomes a
non-compromising obsession. S

It was clear that many of the 12,000 State partisans that jammed the
Coliseum may have been similarly motivated. One woman was on the
verge of hysteria, but didn't get that way until it was announced that it
was Thompson lying on the floor. A

"There isn't any ball game. season, or anything worth something
happening to David," said an emotional Sloan after the game. “I don't
care if he's able to play in the finals.

“When I saw him lying there, ljust thought that I didn't want to be
associated with it." he added. “I wish I hadn’t seen him fall."

The fact Thompson could have suffered paralysis by being brought
to the Coliseum should weigh heavily in his direction on whether or not
to sign a pro contract and skip his senior year at State.

With Manley and company handling him, Thompson's value as a
player could slip from three million to nothing if he gets injured again.

Iowa. and although they were not
able to bring a championship back
to Pitt they were able to gain some
national recognition for their
squad.

A total of 113 teams entered last
weekend's meet. It was the 44th
NCAA tournament and once again

the Big Eight dominated with
Oklahoma winning the top honors
with a point total of 69‘/2.
However. the Pitt wrestlers were
able to amass a total of 15 points
which was good enough to ﬁnish in
the top twenty teams. They ended
the tournament in a tie with Yale
University for 18th place.

But the big story was not the fine
ﬁnish of the team, but rather the
outstanding performance of two
Panther lightweights, George

Bryant and Rande Stottlemyer.
Both wrestlers received AII-Ameri-
canrecognition for their showings
in the meet.

Bryant was the fifth place finisher
in the 118-pound class. He entered
the tournament as the EIWA
champion and winner of the
Sheridan trophy (most ‘pins in the
least amount of time in the EIWA).
He continued his form in the
opening matches of the NCAA's by
first defeating Bob Dalton of
Miami. the Mid-American Confe-

rencé champion, and then out-
wrestling Jim Haines of Wisconsin.

F” Records Full At AIRW4

The Pitt Piranhas set six team
records at the AIAW (Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women) National Championships
at Penn State last weekend.

Taking part in ﬁve of those
records was freshman Angie
Lopez, who just returned from the
Central American Games in Santo
Domingo, where she captured one
silver and two gold medals for
Puerto Rico.

Lopez placed eleventh in the 50

yd and the 100 yd breastroke with
times of 32.87 and 1:10.62
respectively, giving her All-Amer-
ican status. This, needless to say,
is a first in Pitt women’s athletics.
Lopez thought she might have done
better had she not been tired from
seven days of competition in Santo
Domingo.

“I was tapered for the Games

-and that was the ﬁrst thing on my

mind," explained the tanned
swimmer. “Next year, I'll

PCAC champ, and a 12-2 victory
over Rich Dawson of Oklahoma
State in the final match gave
Bryant fifth place. ,

Stottlemyer was able to get off to a
better start as he won his ﬁrst three
matches. His first opponent was
the Western Regional Champ, Dan
Mellow. Rande wrestled him to a
3-3 draw but then out-scored him
2-1 in overtime. After defeating
Dave Schaffer of Cornell, Stottle-
myer was paired with John Fritz of
Penn State.

Stottlemyer had met Fritz twice
previously, ﬁrst in the dual meet at
Penn State which ended in a 9-9 tie
and then in the EIWA’s where Fritz
defeated the Pitt freshman by a 6-4
count. But Stottlemyer was due to
upset his Pennsylvania rival and
ﬁnally "won a hard fought 5-2

_ _ decision. However, he..ii_1jured_his
' ribs in this match which Tprovedlto

be his downfall.

Despite the sore ribs, Stottlemyer
continued to wrestle and next met
Billy Martin of Oklahoma State.
He led in the match until he_
aggravated the injury and ended up
on his back at the 6:46 mark.

Because he had made it to the
semiﬁnals, Stottlemyer could not
finish lower than sixth place, so
coach Dave Adams had him forfeit
his last two matches rather than
risk a more serious iiiiury.

Although the collegiate schedule
has now come to a close, most of
the Pitt wrestlers will see‘ a bit
more action. The Pennsylvania

a World Football League  

Begins Raid on NFL

By BRUCE LOWITT
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK AP--The baby
World Football League plunged
headlong into war with its older
brothers Monday by drafting
players-_-both hangerson and
stars--of the
league and, what might be a more
lucrative market, the Canadian
Football League.

Charlie Evans, a discontented
running back with the NFL's New
York Giants, became the ﬁrst
players named in the WFL‘s “all

National Football ‘

pro" draft, chosen by the Wash-
ington Ambassadors. A spokes-

man for the Washington team said. 3  I
it expected to sign Evans later this‘

week. The Ambassadors had
originally expected to sign him at
the draft.

Larry Csonka, just about every- 

body's No. l on the Super Bowl
champion Miami Dolphins, was
No. 2 in the draft. The steamroller

running back was chosen by the‘, I

Toronto Northmen.

The New York Stars of the WFL

his option in 1973, becomes a free
