Problems with
international TAs

By Greg Evanina
The Pitt News

The following has recently been
made the official policy of the Col-
lege of General Studies:

“Students enrolled in courses
taught by non-native, English-
speaking graduate students who are
having serious difficulties in under-
standing the English of the instruc-
tors and who are unable to change to
another section of the same course
or enroll in another course should
inform their advisor or the associate
dean. If after investigating the situa-
tion it is determined that the student
has made every effort to adjust to the
situation and has not been able to

change sections or courses, the stu- _

dent will be advised to withdraw
from the course and seek a refund.
The dean or associate dean will
make the determination on which
students are to be given tuition
refunds.” .

According to CGS dean John
Bolvin, this policy, only recently
expressed in writing, has been in
effect for several years. The purpose
of publishing it, he said, is to inform
all CGS students of their options.
Last semester, nine CGS students
chose this option.

Bolvin said there are problems
with several TAs; however, he
admitted that the majority of CGS
students do not have difficulty
understanding their foreign instruc-
tors. “We’re not talking every inter-
national graduate student not being
understood,” he said. ‘‘It’s only a
handful that are a problem.”

That “handful," Bolvin said, are
mainly concentrated in the Depart-
ment of Mathematics. Math depart-
ment chairman W.E. Deskins
contended that his department does
its best to screen prospective TAs.
Unfortunately, he said. the commit-
tee is not always able to personally
interview the applicants before they
make a selection. “Most of them
[applicants] are located anywhere
from 100 to 10,000 miles away,” he
said. “Therefore, it's impossible to
interview these people. lt’s not prac-
tical to require that they come here
for a personal interview. And so,
there is little specific knowledge
about their ability to communicate.”

Like the mathematics depart-
ment, many departments are not
sure about their new teaching assis-
tants’ language skills, so the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences graduate office
decided to do something about the
problem.

In March 1977, FAS instituted a
program which requires all foreign
TAs to take an interview test. This
test, conducted by Lionel Menasche
of the linguistics department, is
designed to test the instructors’
English-speaking and comprehen-
sion skills.

TAs who score low on the test are
required to take a course designed
by the English Language Institute.
The TA’s department is asked to
provide these TAs with grading or
non-classroom assignments.

TAs with intermediate scores on
the test must participate in a four-
session tutoring program with a lin-
guistics instructor.

TAs who are permitted to enter
the classroom must be evaluated

In Vitro fertilization

successful at Magee

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

Magee—Women’s Hospital has
announced its first successful in
vitro fertilization after confirming
the pregnancy of Tina Baptiste, 28,
of Butler. The Baptistes, married
four years, were unable to have
children due to scar tissue blockage
of the wife's fallopian tubes. How-
ever, thanks to the in vitro tech-
nique, Mrs. Baptiste is now l3 weeks
pregnant and is expected to have a
normal pregnancy.

The world witnessed its first in
vitro fertilization in l978 when
Louise Brown of Bristol, England,
became known as the earliest “test
tube baby." The Program for In
Vitro Fertilization and Ovum
Transfer at Magee accepted its first
patients in October of 1983 and l6
unsuccessful attempts at fertiliza-
tion were made. Dr. David F.
Archer was named director of =he
program in July 1984. Since that

time, eight more women have had
the procedure done and two preg-
nancies resulted — that of Mrs. Bap-
tiste and a second, which was
aborted.

See page 3

After Archer’s appointment as
program director, the in vitro tech-
nique utilized at Magee underwent
several changes, including modifica-
tions in the induction of ovulation,
sperm recovery and incubation pro-
cesses. Archer, however, does not
attribute the recent success of the
program directly to these changes.

“I know of several units where
success was achieved using our old

’ method,” said Archer. He went on to

explain that it is difficult to deter-
mine which of the modifications, if
any, bad a bearing on the first
pregnancy.

Terrorism has become a way for
nations to wage war inexpensively
and anonymously, according to Dr.
Stephen Sloan, professor of political
science at the University of Okla-
homa and a specialist on the topic of
political violence and terrorism.
Paramilitary terrorists have become
institutionalized, he said, so that ter-
rorism is now an integral part of the
foreign policy of such nations as
lran, Libya and the U.S.S.R.

“Terrorism is a form of armed
diplomacy,” said Sloan, “where an
exchange of bullets is just as signifi-
cant as an exchange of
ambassadors."

Speaking to students from 11 area
high schools at Friday’s meeting of
the World Affairs Council of Pitts-
burgh, Sloan stated that terrorism is

an undeclared war that recognizes
no noncombatants. In war, innocent
civilians get killed, while with terror-
ism innocent civilians are the
targets. No matter if the terrorist is
of the left or right, said Sloan, it still
results in death.

Terrorism is a tactic or technique
which, through violence, creates fear
for a coercive purpose, the professor
said. Calling it “propaganda by the
gun,” he said terrorism is theater.
The terrorist defines his audience
before striking. Increasingly, he
said, terrorists rely on the use of
modern mass communications to
convey their message to a global
audience with a speed unheard of
before.

This makes terrorism especially
effective against western democra-
cies, as they take advantage of the
free press. “You don’t hear about
terrorism in authoritarian countries,

Brain death: a modern medical

beat monitor, familiar from so many
TV shows, beeps regularly. Your
father steps up beside you, and put-
ting his arm over your shoulders
gently, says in a quiet voice, "He is
dead. " You feel shock. Your father
leads you from the room,‘ the others
follow. In the conference room
down the hall, the unidentiﬁed man
begins to speak.

He offers sincere condolences and
begins explaining that although his
heart is beating and he is breathing.
your relatives brain isfully inactive
and is, in fact, dead. He explains that
your relatives organs may save the
life of another if they were donated
for transplant.

W0’1d€'f» “How dead?” The machines
say life. "Prove it, ” you challenge.

Death in this case is not tradi-
tional death, which is determined by
the loss of functioning of the heart
and lungs. The death portrayed here
is “brain death," in which “the total
and irreversible cessation of brain
function” has occurred, including
the action of the brain stem, which
regulates and directs the vital func-
tions of the heart and lungs. The
machines are what maintain these

functions in a brain-dead patient.

Brain death as a criterion for
death has been accepted by 39 states
in judicial rulings or, as in the state
of Pennsylvania, by legislative
action.

The director of the University of
Pittsburgh‘s organ procurement
program, Donald W. Denny, spent
much of I981-82 in efforts to secure
passage of Pennsylvania's Act No.
1982-323, the “Uniform Determina-
tion of Death Act.”

This act has been a great help to
Denny's life-saving activities. A
large part of Denny’s difficulties
arose from doctors’ fears of “the
legitimacy of public support for the
concept of brain death." This is a
prime concern to physicians, Denny
said, who pay $20,000 to $70,000 a
year in malpractice insurance.”

Denny received support for the
proposal from the Pennsylvania
Catholic Conference, the state
Department of Health and Surgeon
General C. Everett Coop, a strong
pro-life advocate. Small pockets of
opposition arose but were counter-
acted by Co0p’s support.

The same type of proposal has
been opposed in the New York state
legislature by right—to-life groups

and Orthodox Jews for the last I0
years. The issue was decided last
Oct. 30, however, when New York's
highest court, in a decision which
convicted two defendants of homi-
cide, ruled that brain death is equi-
valent to traditional death.

Judge Lawrence H. Cooke told
The New York Times, ‘When the
respiratory and circulatory func-
tions are maintained by mechanical
means, their significance as signs of
life is at best ambiguous."

Dr. Moses D. Tendler -— “afore-
most authority on Jewish medical
ethics," according to The Jewish
Chronicle — speaking at Poale
Zedeck Orthodox Synagogue,
retracted statements from an article
he wrote in I968, in which he “con-
demned transplantation as murder.”

Denny hailed the decision,
remarking that a decision by the

state’s highest court rules out
appeals which can be invoked
against legislation. He stressed,

however, that doctors are “still dedi-
cated to saving life.” Presbyterian-
University Hospital has several
“nationally renowned" brain resus-
citation specialists who make every
effort to save the patient.

If their efforts cannot retain life.

dilemma

Denny’s job comes in. He empha-
sizes that he does not act as a per-
suader. “My job, as I see it, is to be
sure that the family understands that
the patient is dead and to inform
them that they have a choice to
make.” He does not dispute their
decision.

An implied consent law, which
grants donation unless a card desig-
nating non-consent was previously
obtained, is currently in effect in
France. Asked about the possibili-
ties of such a law in the United
States, Denny replied that it
“wouldn’t fly“ and further that he
would oppose it. Even when a
patient is carrying a donor card,
Denny obtains permission for trans-
plant from the family. “It [implied
consent] would have no impact on
organs for transplant," Denny said;
he would still contact the family and
respect their right to veto,

In an increasingly impersonal
world, organ donation at the Pitts-
burgh Transplant Foundation is
kept personal.

One woman, in a letter to Denny,
called her son’s donation, which
saved a life, a “beautiful tribute;
even in his death he helped others.”

Sterile University

  

Perhaps the sterile quality of the William Pitt
Union should not be condemned and simply passed
over as nothing more than a great insensitivity to
architecture and humans. Perhaps it is something
deeper. We refer to the general tone which the uni-
versity has in recent years assumed: The trend
toward prettiness, the trend toward facade-building
and the trend toward the non-intellectual, favoring
high-technology impressiveness. We refer to the

Dorm Life Sterile Union

Conrada Fabrizio’s Jan. 21 article Contrary to the assertions made

trend toward trendiness.

Trendiness, in and of itself, is not evil. Indeed, it is
sometimes useful for 13-year-old girls who need to
find a niche into which they can relax. In a major
university, however, trendiness is a paramount evil,
for it is the exact antithesis of a university’s purpose:
to provide a physical space for the free and unob-
structed exchange of ideas. Lamentably, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh seems to be no place for such a

thing. a

One need only look around for proof. Look at the
Five-year Plan, and read about the fact that the
School of Engirieeering isn’t entirely up to scratch,
yet is recommended for an increase in funding, while
linguistics operates at the same level of quality, but is
recommended for a decrease in funding.

Look at the attention focused on the football and
basketball teams — both trendy sports —- and com-

’ pare it with the attention focused on volleyball or
soccer. Read President Posvar’s cover letter to the
F ive-Year Plan in which he states that he has no idea
whether there is any worth to the Campus of the
Future project at all, but that he intends to see those
plans through to completion.

We, the University of Pittsburgh, are at a critical
moment; we can take steps to insure that the unive_r-
sity becomes and remains a place for the free
exchange of ideas (be those ideas trendy or merely
real), or continue on our present course toward
becoming a post-high school vo-tech, decorated by
buzzing, ﬂashing and dazzling lights, behind which
that important intangible is lacking.

seems to imply that dorm life isjust a
step below heaven, and a small step
at that. She has obviously never
lived in Pitt’s dorms. After two-and-
a-half years in Pitt’s dorms, I hon-
estly believe that the only advantage
they have is their location.

Besides being overpriced and
undersized, there are other down-
falls with which to contend. Exces-
sive noises and overcrowding
accompanied by a general lack of
privacy and less than appetizing
food are some of the more notable
undesirables. Housing 30 or more
people who hold different social,
political and religious beliefs on the
same floor is fine in a shelter for the
homeless, but not in a dormitory.

Becoming a commuter isn’t a
“cure-all” solution. Commuters
must deal with a severe parking
problem, a long walk to class or
hours with nowhere to go in between
classes. But for me these
inconveniencesare small compared
to the hassles of dorm life. Since
becoming a commuter, I can express
my thoughts on dorm life with a
familiar cliche. “The dorms are a
great place to visit, but I wouldn't
want to live there."

No Crock

I think in the future your colum-
nists should write about subjects
they know something about for it is
obvious that Bryan Lee (“DMS: A
lot of ‘Crock,’ " Jan. 23) doesn’t
know what he’s talking about.

If his column was to be about the
cartoon industry, then he knows
what he's talking about. However, it
was about the steel industry, an area
I don’t think he's qualified to dis-
cuss. Anyonewho puts the entire
blame for the steel industry’s woes
square on the shoulders ofthe Unit-
ed Steel Workers of America is
naive. To use an old cliche, it takes
two to tango, and it also takes two to
negotiate. If U.S. Steel could see the
troubles coming from foreign com-
petition, why didn’t they explain
that to the union? I‘m sure that a
reasonable person, given a chance,
wouldn't price himself out of ajob.

As for foreign competition, I’m
sure Mr. Lee thinks it must be fair
for the steel companies to get away
with the same atrocities they got
away with here before unionization
and the Wagner Act. If 70 hours per

a company more competitive. I
guess Mr. Lee thinks that we can
keep up with the newer, more up-to-
date equipment of the Japanese and
Germansjust on the good ol‘ Repub-
lican belief in capitalism.

Well, I'm afraid that 70-year-old
open hearth furnaces can't compete
with the new electric furnaces of the
Japanese and Germans, no matter
how hard you try.

As for the union: Yes, they got
away with too much. Their pay was
too high and maybe they weren't
working as hard as they should. Yes,
they're to blame also, but as I said
before, negotiations take two. If
both sides weren’t so distrustful of
the other, maybe this situation
wouldn’t have developed.

This brings me to the point of my
letter. Mr. Lee should have stuck
with his discussion of the Denomi-
national Ministry Strategy. I don't
agree with its tactics and methods.
They're ineffective and embarrass-
ing to good union people. The only
way to solve this problem in the steel
industry is to sit down and negotiate
between the union, the leaders of the
steel industry and the U.S. govern-
ment. Since steel is essential to our
national defense, that makes it a
government problem. Cooperation
between these groups is the only way
tosolve this problem. Inthe future,
Mr. Lee should write about Walt
Disney, since he’s inept to write
about the steel industry's problems.

White Apparition

After looking at the front-page
photo (Jan. 23) entitled “A Winter's
Night on Forbes Avenue," we were
orgasmic to see that the White
Tower Restaurant had been re-
erected. We walked down to the
corner of Bouquet and Forbes to
satisfy our yearning for the taste of
the White Tower burger. Much to
our surprise, it had been torn down
again!

Does the White Tower only come
out at night? Do you know when it
will pop up again‘? If so, could you
let us know? Doesn’t it cost the
owners of White Tower a fortune to
play this silly game of peek-a—boo?

I. ‘t J Wu»: L-."i.. -u". i,.'

in last Friday's editorial, “Sterile
Union," I find the student union

(and I insist on calling it that)’

extremely useful. Granted, it could
use a free-service TV room for stu-
dents deprived of such luxuries, a
cafe that stays open until at least ll
p.m. and a 24-hour open door pol-
icy. Despite these deficiencies, how-

ever, the student union has a lot of-

unrsengnimi natgntial:
It IS not the building, but the stu-

dents who create a sterile atmos-
phere. Your editorial contains
comments on how the student union
used to be, but it doesn’t consider
that students are not like they used
to be. Take, for example, our placid
obedience to printed commands.
I've yet to be apprehended by a
sign while reclining in the “red
room.” lt’s usually quiet in there,
unless assaulted by sporadic blurbs
of mainstream bv WPTS. The furni-
ture is comfortable, and the lights
aren't so offensive as those in the
“blue room. " I rather like the marble
walls and plush furniture. It makes

V me feel privileged.

There are no matrons around tak-
ing names of those who put their feet
up. If and when they appear, we can
simply drive them out with the smell
of dirty socks or aim our soda cans
in their direction. Seriously though,
most students let their feet hang over
the edge of the couch, dispose of
their garbage properly and even use
the ashtrays instead of the floor.
Rarely do they jump on the furni-
ture, unless they are startled by that
most obnoxious buzz occasionally
spat from the elevators. I see no need
for juvenile signs.

However, if the administrative
staff thinks it necessary to create and
enforce more regulations, they can
at least come up with some worth
violating. The fact that they placed a
sign which reads “No Food" in the
Kurtzman room tells me that we’re
too well behaved. I'd be more enter-
tained by one that read, “No Drugs,
Sex or Violence Permitted on These
Premises." The day we see a sign
posted that reads “Defacement of
This Property Will Result in a $300
Fine,” we will know that the preser-
vation of the student union is being
threatened.

Furthermore. there are several
relatively unnoticed lounges on var-
ious ﬂoors of the union for those
who are self-conscious of their re-
clining. many areas conducive to
group activity as you so define it,
and scores of hardly used stairwells,
cubicles and open rooms suitable for

desire. Surely anything is possible in
the student union, from sleeping to
studying, from sex to consumption.
It is only ours if we treat it as such.
And if the administration imposes
martial law, we can do as the French
did in I968 and barricade the place.
So what? Many of us practically live
here anyway.

The column “From, Where I
Stand” by Tim Hunter (Jan. 21)
prompted me to write this letter.

The column was titled “Live and
Let?". It stated that: “Abortion is an
act of murder. All arguments to the
contrary arejust malarkey.” It seems
to me that the title was derived from
the saying “Live and let live,” which
is good advice. Why doesn’t the
author and all those involved on
both sides of the abortion argument
take it?

If you’re not for abortion, don’t
have one. But don’t interfere with
those who wish to have one. What is

the purpose of such radical actions"

as blowing up abortion clinics? It is
almost comical to blow things up to
“save” lives.

By adopting the “live and let live"
philosophy, there is no longer any
need to distinguish when life begins
— whether it be at conception, birth
or anyplace in between or after.
Believe it begins whenever you like.

But don’t try to force someone else ‘

to believe what you believe.
If you’re for abortion, have one.

> Have two if you want. But don’t try

to force those who don’t believe in
abortion to change their beliefs.

Standing up for one’s beliefs is
something we all should do. But
what is the purpose of forcing your
beliefs on others? What does it
accomplish? You win. The govern-
ment makes the law saying you were
right and those who opposed you
were wrong. You’re happy. The peo-
ple you fought against are still going
to do what they want anyway. You
did nothing more than boost your
ego.

I suppose I should be classifed as
pro-abortion because I'm not
against it. Actually, I believe in leav-
ing the decision up to those
involved. As far as I’m concerned, if
you’re not in a position where you
have to make a decision whether or
not to have an abortion, then you
should argue about somethirig
worthwhile — like whether or not a
tomato is a fruit or vegetable.

The Pitt News, Monday, January 28, 1985

Trying to Break Through/

to terminate the lives of the little
ones within us, and if we choose
abortion, we will send our babies to
a violent death.

Since The Pitt News frequently
runs ads which advertise abortion
clinics, we think it only fair that the
readers be aware of what happens in
these clinics.

We would like to clarify the term
“abortion" and what it means to the
children who are being aborted. This
letter contains explicit material, so if
you are unable to read about what is
actually happening to unborn
babies, stop now.

Consider the following methods
of abortion:

0 Hypertonic saline solution. This
solution is injected into the mother's
womb. The saline solution burns the
baby's delicate membranes with
pain similar to that when getting salt
into a wound. The baby will vio-
lently jerk and move in a frantic
attempt to escape the poison. Find-
ing no place of refuge in its mother’s
womb, the baby is forced to sue-
cumb to the poison and is expelled.

0 Abortion by suction. Recently, a
sonogram, which permits visualiza-
tion of events occuring within the
womb, was done on a woman having
an abortion. A film was later shown.
The doctor who did the abortion
quit his job after seeing it and said he
“never wanted to see that film
again.” Statistics show that most
abortions occur between the lvlth
and l2th weeks. The fetus in the film
was only 10 weeks old. Here is a
description of the event:

“At first you see the child at play,
sucking his thumb and moving
about. But at the very moment the
suction tip touches the amnionic sac,
you see the child jump.away and
move to the top of the uterus as
though he senses something aggres-
sive is happening. His mouth opens
up in a silent scream and you can see
his heart speed up and his arms and
legs moving rapidly. Then you see
the suction tube tearing away first
one arm, then the other, as the child
writhes in pain. You see the spinal
column slipping down the tube until
only the baby’s head is left with a
piece of spine on it. And finally you
see the abortionist searching for the

A baby’s head.”

Second— and third- trimester
babies have their heads crushed.
Babies born alive after abortions are
murdered or left to die. Today, right
now, more innocent ones will be vio-
lently aborted.

We weep for the children whose
lives are snuffed out by abortion. We
weep also for the mothers who have
made this choice.

More Foul Play

Bold deception at most, but bril-
liance at least! What better way is
there to launch a verbal attack on
one’s enemy than to accuse him of
the very act he has charged you with?

From this counteraccusation, the
so-called argument proceeds with
subsequent counteraccusations until
a standstill is reached in which both
parties lose sight of their original
claims. This is the intention. Gradu-
ally a sufficient degree of confusion
ensues whereby no outside party
retains a clear view of who is oppos-
ing or defending what.

Rhetorically, this “technique” is
very effective for those who wish to
avoid constructive argument and
discourse. The Reagan administra-
tion is fully aware of the advantages
inherent to this strategy and no one
knows this better than the Nicara-
guan government.

By adding the evil image of the
Ayatollah Khomeini to the Sandi-
nista’s list of villainous allies, Presi-
dent Reagan has prepared the
grounds for his latest attack. “The
subversion we are talking about,” he
said “violates international law.”
Amazing! Notice how easily the
accusations roll off the forked
tongue of a leader whose adminis-
tration has just attempted to with-
draw from a suit filed against it in
the International Court of Justice
for violating international law. The
Nicaraguan government has filed
suit against the United States, charg-
ing the U.S. with attempting to sub-
vert and overthrow an elected and
recognized government.

Incredible? Not really. Since this
propaganda maneuver has been
examined and exposed for some
time now, we could expect a more
sophisticated approach in rational-
izing an illegitimate act. (We’ve had
enough practice. Does anyone out
there remember Vietnam?) But we
can simply consider the source and
call it typical. ,

First, let’s consider the entrance of
Khomeini in this dastardly scheme.
When asked on what evidence the
president based his interpretation of
Khomeini’s motives, White House
spokesman Larry Speakes replied
graciously for the president that it
was “public knowledge” (another
old trick) that Prime Minister Hus-
sein Moussavi of Iran had visited
Nicaragua this week. So? Obviously
from this isolated fact we can con-
clude that Nicaragua is-receiving
support from Iran and that this sup-
port, in whatever form it takes (and
it must be conspiratorial), is
dangerous.

Following this line of thought, we
can attempt to claim that because
the Sandinista government has been
elected by the Nicaraguan people to
govern, that because the elections
were legitimately conducted and
that because this government has
publicly advocated a pluralist politi-
cal system, it should be isolated from
relations with other Third World
countries and accept visitors only
from those allied with, or approved
by, the United States.

Despite the fact that Prime Minis-
ter Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, Presi-

page 5

dent Migel de la Madrid of Mexico
and the Catholic Bishop of Nicara-
gua have recognized and approved
of the Sandinistas’ efforts to reach
an accord with the U.S. through its
public affirmation of the legitimacy
of U.S. interests in Central America,
the Reagan administration con-
tinues to further thrust its macho
policy by calling assistance to the
contras' subversive activities “an act
of self-defense.”

Unfortunately, a large portion of
the American public will compla-
cently accept this absurdity. Such
are the modern politics of madness.

If you infer from this writing that I
support Third World revolutions
and the Ayatollah, hate the Reagan
administration, and am one of
“them liberals," you are wrong and
serve as an example to illustrate my
point. We can no longer accept these
inconsistencies as viable policy. Not
only is such “policy” counterproduc-
tive, it is downright embarrasing.
Even Fidel Castro affirmed the
potentiality of a capitalist economy
in Nicaragua. Would it not better
secure our interests and theirs to
assist them in developing such an
economy? It would probably be
cheaper than ﬁnancing a covert war
and decrease the reasons for main-
taining such a high defense budget.

Our responsibility is to critically
examine our own histories, the
extent of which we have or haven’t
changed and ways in which we can
become better. This requires honest
inquiry and a desire to learn the
truth. Regardless of who is right or
wrong, legitimate or illegitimate in
these childish games our govern-
ment renames “security issues,” it is
obvious that the information fed to
us is for the most part unadorned
bull. Do not simply react to what is
written or being said, but think —
and do so critically.

From Under My Desk / Dan Bates  
Staying Llnfashionably Warm I

Okay, go ahead and laugh!

Laugh at the two shirts and
sweater I have on. Make fun of my
wool socks and winter boots. You
can even ridicule me for wearing
such a bulky coat. If you find plea-
sure in poking fun at the long knit
scarf that almost buries my face, or
the furry earmuffs, go right ahead
because frankly, I don’t care. I am
warm.

Pittsburgh has been hit this past
week with snow and arctic tempera-
tures — bone-chilling, sub-zero
temperatures — which make me
cold, almost frozen. To deal effec-
tively with this discomfort, I usually
wear a rather largeportion of my
wardrobe. Once dressed, I waddle
(because walking is too difficult with
the bulk of clothing) to the bus stop,
through town“ and then around the
Pitt campus. _

Oddly, though, I. have noticed
many curious folks staring at me
throughout the course of my journey
to school. Many just look once.

Some take a second look. Others
point to me and shake their heads.

As I climbed into a bus the other
day wearing my winter attire, two
scantily dressed women glared
directly at me and exclaimed, “Look
at him!” Then they laughed. But I
was warm.

I was also somewhat disturbed -
at first. I began to realize, though,
why I had become such a spectacle;
my clothes aren’t fashionable.
Should I feel embarrassed?

Well, what should I wear" then?
For the past several days, I’ve been
pondering that question in a futile
attempt to appear in vogue. Stand-
ing on the Cathedral lawn, I have

been observing the many fashiona- ‘

ble Pitt students traipsing through
the snow and slush.

_You know, for a moment I
thought spring had arrived. Girls
were wearing crop-legged pants,
leaving ankles bare (except for those
little frilly socks). Others wore
dresses and even mini-skirts. De-

spite the ice and slush, some of the
most fashionable women slid
around in high-heeled pumps. These
women were covered with goose
bumps, they shivered and shook, but
they did look good.

Guys paraded around in light
jackets and tennis shoes. I also
noticed that few men wore hats. I
guess hats really aren’t in style this
winter. ’

Now I understand why people
laugh at me. I suppose I really look
odd, and I’m definitely not very styl-
ish. Even when the temperature
dropped below zero, these people
pranced around in the latest styles of
spring wear. They maintained their
high fashion throughout the cold
weather, even after severe storm
warnings. I must admit, though, that
those bandages I spotted on many
frost-bitten ears certainly look sillier
than furry earmuffs.

So go right ahead and laugh at
me, because I just don’t care. I may
look odd, but I am warm.

Youth horne controversy
emerges in

By Jon Williams
The Pitt News

Local residents are angry over a
proposal to place a youth home in
north Oakland. Scheduled to open
at 412 North Neville St. is a clinic for
eight to 12 juveniles needing treat-
ment for family, social or minor
criminal problems.

The proposal was approved by the
City Planning Council on Oct. 16,
1984, and now awaits a City Council
vote on Jan. 30. The decision to
place the home in Oakland was sug-
gested by the Allegheny Juvenile
Court, according to Hank Lipinski,
director of Alternative Program
Associates Inc.

This would bring the number of
facilities operating in the north
Oakland-East Liberty area to three.
This additional burden is what local
residents are protesting.

Helen Schlenke, a resident of
North Dithridge St. and the presi-
dent of Bellefield Area Citizens,
said: We’re opposed to it only
because we already have our share.
We want other areas to attend to_
problems like this as well.”

Adding to the dispute are conflict-
ing interpretations of a city ordi-
nance passed in 1980 restricting the
building of new institutional centers.
According to Schlenke, City Coun-
cil in 1980 placed a mandatory
quarter-mile distance between facili-
ties to prevent the overcrowding of
correctional institutions in the city.

The Pitt.Ncws, Monday, January .28,..l98$

Oa

“We‘re not opposed to the home,
but it is completely against the intent
of the earlier. legislation.  Now
there will be three homes closer than
about one-fifth of a mile to each
other; they have no intention to go
with the law.”

Lainski confirmed the established
limit but said it does not apply to this
case. He stated: “The 1980 council
limits areas where group homes can
be placed and the number that can
be built. If a new facility was created,
because of the home on Dithridge, it
would be within the quarter-mile
[restriction]. But the Dithridge
home was operated as a group home
since I972, before the ordinance.”

He added that lmicus House (one
of three homes to which Schlenke
referred) had operated at that loca-
tion but had relocated to Lawrence-
ville, opening the war for the current
home.

City Councilman Jack Wagner
provided further insight into the
problem: “What we really have here
is a home, and it has restrictions. It's
not consistent with its surrounding
buildings. That can have a detrimen-
tal effect on a neighborhood,”
Wagner said. “What you have here
are juveniles convicted of some
crimes living in a residential area.
My No. l concern in this is for the
neighborhood.”

Lapinski defended his position.
“Look at our track record in Bethel
Park, where we provide services. In
five years, none of our kids have
caused damage.”

Another resident, Steve Bowser,
president of Pi Lambda Phi frater-

kland

nity, disagrees with Schlenke and
Wagner. “I don‘t mind the home
being placed here. We have our
problems with our neighbors, and
we’re pretty cooperative. It’s a good
neighborhood.”

The location of the facility near
major libraries, schools and art cen-
ters is one of the reasons Lapinski
gave for Oakland’s receiving the
home.

Schlenke is of another opinion.
“The kids will be attending Schenley
High School, the second most segre-
gated school in the district. They
didn’t want to go to the suburbs
because they’re better organized [to
handle a similar situation].”

Wagner said that at the last coun-
cil meeting, when public testimony
was received, several residents men-
tioned the activities of Pitt's fraterni-
ties as a main reason to place the
facility elsewhere.

To this, Bowser said: “I’m defi- 
nitely interested in helping the h 
home. Some Carnegie—Mellon Uni— A . .; I if
versity fraternities come over to the
halfway house to help out all the
time. I think it would be a pretty

good thing for us to get involved in
and try to help.”

Wagner would not say how he will
vote on Wednesday, but com-
mented: “Members of the program
and the [city] administration will be
present. I believe this proposal war-
rants discussion. The public testimo-
ny will be reiterated to give council
the feelings of the public.  I’m
really waiting for more information,
because it hasn’t been proven to me
this facility could best serve as
intended.”

In vitro fertilization

successful at Magee

continuedfrom page one

'lhe process of in vitro fertiliza-
tion begins when the woman is given
the drugs pergonal and clomid to
increase the chances of more than
one egg developing. Then the
patient’s hormone levels are moni-
tored in order to determine the cor-
rect time of ovulation. Once the
follicle reaches about 25 millimeters
in diameter, the egg can be recov-
ered. Egg recovery is accomplished
by a simple surgical procedure called
a laparoscopy in which tiny punc-
tures are made above the ovaries to
release the egg.

When the egg is recovered it is
taken directly to an adjacent lab,
where it is fertilized in a test tube
before being transferred to a petri

dish and incubated for a period of36
hours. The embryo is then returned
to the patient’s womb and the wait-
ing begins. .

Throughout the procedure,
records are kept documenting the
progress of each successive step.
Photographs taken ofthe eggs upon
recovery and before returning to the
womb are also kept on file to be
referred back to later if complica-
tions should arise. “We keep very
complete records," said research
technician Jonathan Richards. “So
complete that sometimes if I sneeze l
have to write it down."

. ‘According to Archer, in vitro fer-
tilization is often a last-ditch effort
for infertile couples and is attempted

only after other surgical procedures
fail. Due to the high cost and low
success rate of the procedure, each
couple is limited to three attempts.
This was the first attempt for Tina
and Russell Baptiste, and according
to Archer, Mrs. Baptiste had a hard
time believing she was pregnant even
after she witnessed the heart of her
unborn infant beating on the screen
of a sonogram at Magee.

Four more women will attempt
the in vitro procedure this month,
hoping to become some of the few
successes. Although it is difficult to
predict an outlook for the program
at Magee after just one pregnancy,
Archer is looking forward to eventu-
ally reaching a 20 to 30 percent suc-
cess rate.

Speaker warns of .
international terrorism

continued from page one
said Sloan, “because the state itselfis
practicing terrorism.”

As an example of state-practiced
terrorism, he said that the Soviet
Union has formed “marriages of
convenience" with Cuba and Nica-
ragua to create instability in Central
America and Western Europe to test
the resolve of the United States.

It is difficult to respond to a spe- i

cific act of terrorism, Sloan
explained, because those who
engage in it are from small, clandes-
tine groups. He used the bombing of
the U.S. embassy in Beirut to illus-
trate the difficulty of tracing the
sponsor of the act.

“In anger, we’d like to strike back.
But how and against whom?” ‘he
asked.

He warned of the danger of being
unprepared for terrorism. lfa demo-
cracy overreacts to terrorism, it can

become authoritarian and serve to
legitimize the terrorists cause.
“Unless we are willing to accept that
terrorism will happen to us, we will
be unprepared and overreact. Over-
reaction plays into the hands of the
terrorist."

The way to counter terrorism is to
delegitimize and deglamorize it, said
Sloan — to say they are not heroes
but criminals. “They can be dealt
with as criminals,” said Sloan.
“They are not patriots but killers."

The key is intelligence, stated
Sloan. Without good intelligence to
analyze and penetrate the clandes-
tine groups, terrorism cannot be
stopped.“You have to have effective
intelligence to meet terrorism,” he
said.

Just as important is a govern-
ments resolve. Fighting terrorism is
a long process. A government must
be willing to engage “ a protracted

battle of a dirty war. One must have
a committment to fight and fight
hard.”

Sloan said the Reagan adminis-
tration is pursuing the right direc-
tion with the policy announced
recently by Secretary of State
George Schultz that the U.S. should
respond quickly and militarily to
terrorist attacks against the U.S.

But this will prove difficult,
according to Sloan. Reprisals, he
said, call for effective intelligence to
locate theperpetrators ofterrorism.
Sloan suggested that to strike back
blindly would in itself be an act of
terrorism. “This administration is
pursuing the right direction.”

“The threat cannot be over-
stated,” said Sloan. “Terrorism is
not what happens to other people. It
is what happens to us.”

each term by the Office for the Eva-
luation of Teaching. The evaluation,
which is completed by undergradu-
ates, must show that at least 80 per-
cent of the students had little or no
difficulty understanding their TA’s
spoken English.

If only 50-80 percent of the stu-
dents said they understood their TA,
then his department is notified and
the TA must be tutored. The surveys
are continued each term until his rat-
ings improve.

When less than 50 percent of the
students said they could understand
the TA, the TA is prohibited from
teaching until his language is
improved.

This percentage system was deter-
mined by FAS Dean of Graduate
Studies Elizabeth Barranger. Bar-
ranger is familiar with the TA situa-
tion, since her job requires’ her to
oversee all graduate students.

Barranger said the departments
with the highest number of foreign

, TAs are math, computer science,

chemistry, economics and physics.
When asked why there is such a high
number of international students in
these majors, she replied, “The
departments look very hard for
domestic students — it’s a high
priority for our recruitment. We try
to find good U.S. students. But the
problem in many of these fields is
students can get jobs right after col-
lege and so they aren't going on to
graduate school.”

In response to the CGS tuition
refund policy, which assumes the
TA is inept, Barranger does not
agree that the TA is wholly responsi-
ble for every conﬂict. “There is a
problem with some of the under-
graduates who don’t give them
(TAS) a chance,” she said. “They
come in and just decide that this per-
son will be too difficult to
understand.”

Ironically, Barranger finds some I

fault with the interview process she
currently oversees and for which she
set the percentile guidelines. “The
thing that’s, difficult,” she said, “is
that we can give an interview test to a
person, and both-the person giving
the test and the two people we have
sitting there will give the person a
high score. When I get the results
[from the Office for the Evaluation
of Teaching] back from the under-
graduates, they will say they have
trouble understanding his English.
And I know that it’s not the English
they have trouble understanding.

pening that's made it difficult -
they may not be speaking slowly
enough, or they may not be using the

unprepared or they may have all
sorts of other problems that don't
have anything to do with their
English.

“On the other hand,” she con-
tinued, “from the perception of the
undergraduate, it can be even the
material that's difficult and he
would feel that he’s having trouble
understanding the English. So it’s
difficult to measure the problem. It’s
difficult to say whether it’s the Eng-
lish or whether it’s something else.
And when we get cases like this, we
try to do a variety of things besides
the English — we visit classrooms,

we tape, we do all sorts of things. So
we have trouble trying to correct the

problem because it’s not necessarily '

the English that’s the problem.”

Barranger’s opinion that under-
graduates are part of the problem is
also held by College of Arts and
Sciences dean Irwin Schulman.
Schulman does not feel the need to
implement a refund policy as CGS
has done.

His reason for this is that CAS is

more ﬂexible than CGS, because ifa ’

problem arises, there is usually an
adequate number of alternate recita-
tion sections to which the student
could be moved. Additionally,
Schulman said that because of the
relatively small number of com-
plaints he receives about TAs, a
refund policy is not really needed.

However, Schulman does find
fault in one aspect of the current
system used to educate the TAs.
“The problem," he said, “is con-
stantly recreating itself since we get a
new batch [of TAs] every year  and
it’s not wholly soluble.”

Like Deskins and Barranger,
Schulman places most of the blame
on undergraduates: “We have a stu-
dent body that is fairly parochial in
some ways — or at least some
members of our student body are —
and if they [TAs] don’t talk McKees—
port, it’s not English as far as they’re
concerned. So one has to sort out
genuine‘ communication problems
from mere provincialism.”

Schulman added, however, that
when he investigates legitimate com-
plaints about foreign TAs, he inves-
tigates the problem. He said that
when the student’s problem is
genuine, his office sides with that
student.

Confessions of
a foreign TA

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

Ashvin Rajan gets a knot in his
stomach every time he enters the
classroom to teach. Twenty-
three-year-old Rajan is a mathe-
matics teaching assistant from
Madras, India.

When Rajan steps into the
room for a class’first meeting, he
explained, his students seem to
glare at him coldly.

“I can picture the emotions
running through their heads.
Their first emotion is, well, I am
just another foreign teaching
assistant to put up with."

Rajan said he feels stigmatized
as a foreign teaching assistant,
and he is frequently faced with
overcoming this‘ derogatory
label.

“Until I open my mouth, you
realize, I’ve not really convinced
them that I can speak English or
communicate with them with
minimum problems,” Rajan
said. “There is a great deal of
resentment and hostility.”

Rajan first came to the United
States when he was 17 years old.
“I cameon a visit with my par-
ents for 10 days. I intended to see

Disneyland, the Empire State
Building and the Washington
Monument,” he explained.
Local friends in Pittsburgh
strongly urged his father to put
him in school at the University of
Pittsburgh. His parents wanted
him to stay in the U.S.; they
thought they would be giving
him a good education, Rajan

said.

At first, Rajan resented his
parents’ decision. “I didn’t like it ’
at all," he explained. “I had been
admitted into a technical insti-
tute in India for further educa-
tion. All my friends were going
off to college someplace, and I
fully expected to join them."

He said the adjustment to the
U.S. was difficult. “I found
myself culturally and socially
displaced from my circle of
friends."

After about one year, though,
Rajan did adjust to his new
environment. As a teacher, he
has also learned to cope, but he
still gets frustrated.

“My frustration is that, most
of the time when I walk into the
classroom, I’m really not emo-
tionally or psychologically pre-
pared to put up with all this sort
of resentment,” Rajan explained.
“I'm only trying to do my job.”

Bugs Bunny’s“ creator
-condemns new crap”

By Dirk Kaufman
The Pitt News

Cartoonist Chuck Jones, at 72,
was as animated as his characters in
a lecture at the Carnegie Institute
last Saturday. Jones, the creator of
such characters as Bugs Bunny, Wile
E. Coyote, Pepe le Pew, Road-
runner, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd,
began his talk by saying, “I can tell
just looking at your faces that you‘re
all idiots. Lots of twitching going on
out there."

He told the crowd that he was
amazed to see Mr. T every week on
television and at the same time see
people getting upset over violence in
his cartoons.

The characters that dominate Sat-
urday morning today, Jones said,
are far worse than his own. “The

standard today is that the good-
looking characters are nice and the
ugly ones are bad," he said. “I think
it’s horrible to raise children on this.
Children will actually grow up
believing this.” He described the
entertainment available to kids on
Saturday mornings these days as
“crap. I've tried other words,” he
said, “but theyjust don’t seem to fit."

Remember Wile E. Coyote and
the Acme company? The way the
poor animal’s cars would wilt
behind ‘his head as yet another
boulder dropped toward him? The
character and the company were the
product of Jones’ imagination. The
“Acme Do-It-Yourself Supersonic
Rocket” and “Acme Disintegrating
Pistol" both came from his child-
hood years, as did most other Acme
products. ,

The crowd remained on the edge
of the seats (or steps) for the full two
hours, taking in every word. They

laughed at and cheered personal
favorites.

On a sheet distributed at ticket
stands, Jones was quoted: “A small
child once said to me: ‘you don’t
draw Bugs Bunny, you draw pic-
tures of Bugs Bunny.’ That‘s a very
profound observation, because it
means that he thinks that the charac-
ters are alive, which, as far as I’m
concerned, is true. And I feel the
same way about animation  Ani-
mation isn’t an illusion of life, it is
life.” .

When the last ﬁlm ended and
Jones walked onstage for final com-
ment, the crowd stood and cheered
him. He blushed and dropped his
head, then looked up at the people

and smiled. He smiled broadly as the .

clapping faded and the crowd sat
down. “If you’re insane, ...” he said,
while the crowd smiled warmly at
him. “I’ve been seeking this kind of
insanity all my life.”

Pitt art exhibit opens

By Laura Craiy
The Pitt News

An exhibition of the new acquisi-
tions of the University Art Gallery is
currently being shown in the back
gallery in the Frick Fine Arts Build-
ing. These works were acquired in
1983 and 1984, and are being shown
for the first time until Feb. 20.

Many of the works are l9th cen-
tury French drawings received from
an anonymousdonor. These include
a drawing of an Arab ﬂutist, attrib-
uted to Jean Leon Gerome and a
drawing by a pupil of Gerome,
Alfred Phillipe Roll. The drawing by
R01] is a beautiful portrait of an

elderly peasant woman sitting in the
woods. Roll’s paintings, featuring
naturalistic scenes of peasant life
and landscapes, earned’ many
medals and honors in the latter part
of the 19th century.

The displav also includes a Japa-
nese woodblock print, a Cambodian
stone rubbing and some Japanese
scrolls, one of which is a travel map.
Besides the drawings and these
objects, there are three series of
works by individual artists.

On the left wall just inside the
gallery are five etchings by Richard
Reiber. The subjects of these prints
are industry, machinery and the city.
These contrast with the photographs
on the right wall by Ralph Gibson -

posed portraits of young women,
many with attention to severe con-
trasts of light and dark.

The third series is not really a se-
ries, but rather three examples of
painting by Matthew Parcel]. The
paintings are very different from one
another and show of both diversity
of subject and form.

The exhibition contains a variety
of art styles, techniques and time
periods. Some are academic pieces,
some are more adventurous works.
There should be something to inter-
est everyone. The exhibition should
be seen in order for theipublic to
discover just what kinds of work the
University Art Gallery has in its
holdings.

Newsbriefs

(UPI) — Three former members
of Frank Zappa’s Mothers ofInven-
tion have ﬁled a l3-million-dollar
lawsuit against him and two of his
music companies. Don Preston,
Jimmy Carl Black and John “Bunk”
Gardner said they have not received
any royalty checks from Zappa since
1969.

The lawsuit claims that Zappa
broke three different contracts with
his band members. It also says that
Zappa improperly obtained rights to
master recordings of his records
without including the musicians as
partners.

Neville Johnson, the attorney for
the three musicians, said he’s trying
to locate more’than 20 other musi-
cians who were members of ~ the
Mothers from I965 to 1973 to have
them join in the class action suit.

Neither Zappa nor his attorney
could be reached for comment.

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) — A
Philadelphia orderly testified Satur-

' day that he saw a 32-week-old fetus

move and gasp for air after a doctor
said it was dead. The testimony
came in a preliminary hearing for
Dr. Joseph Melnick. The 62-year-
old physician is accused of withhold-
ing treatment from the female fetus
following a Sept. 12 abortion. The
fetus died about 90 minutes after it
was aborted.

Orderly John Dougherty testified
that he heard the cry but that Mel-
nick told him to wrap the tiny body
and carry it to the morgue.

‘ “The Pitt News, Monday, January 28, 1985

(UPI) —— Milk cartons went on
sale Saturday carrying a message.
The cartons are printed with the
photographs of missing children.
One of the children pictured on the
cartons is a 5-year-old girl from
Pittsburgh, Nicole Lynn Bryner,
who has been missing since March
1982. The youngster turns six next
month‘.

The cartons, distributed by a Con-
necticut company, also contain brief
biographies of the missing children.
Also listed is a toll-free telephone
number for the National Center for
Missing and Exploited children.

CINCINATTI (UPI) — Officials
in Cincinatti said that they have
detected traces of the chemical ben-
zene in the Ohio River near Pitts-
burgh. A spokesman for the
Cincinatti-based Ohio River Valley
Water Sanitation Committee said
investigators are trying to locate the
source of the poisonous, cancer-
causing substance.

India (UPI) — Leaders of six
nations arrive in India today for a
one-day meeting that they hope will
eventually lead to the ending of the
superpowers‘ arms race.

Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi will
host leaders from Sweden, Mexico,
Tanzania, Argentina and Greece.
His mother, killed by assasins last
year, was an original member of the

group.

The so-called “group of six" first
met in May of last year to issue a
joint declaration calling for a freeze
in the production and deployment of
nuclear weapons.

That meeting followed the col-
lapse of arms talks between the
Soviet Union and the United States.
The two superpowers have since got-
ten together and plan to resume
arms talks in Geneva, Switzerland,
in March.

TEHRAN, Iran (UPI) — Iran
said that it would welcome a full
United Nations investigation of
Iraqi claims that Iran has shelled civ-
ilian targets in the latest round ofthe
war in the Persian Gulf

U.N. teams have been stationed in
both countries since last summer to
make sure they are holding to an
agreement not to attack civilian
targets. Two previous requests for
an investigation came from Iran.

This time, Iran calls the Iraqi.

charges “a propaganda ploy.” Teh-
ran said Iraq only wants to turn
attention away from the U.N.’s find-
ing last month that Iraqi aircraft
dropped cluster bombs on three
Iranian villages, killing nine people.

BEIRUT (UPI) -— The resigna-
tion ofa member of Lebanon’s nine-
man unity cabinet has thrown the
government into paralysis.

Yesterday’s cabinet meeting was
canceled indefinitely, postponing

action to counter the slump of
Lebanon‘s currency against the U.S.
dollar and consideration of security
problems such as the prevention of
bloodshed when Israeli troops leave
southern Lebanon.

Instead, Lebanese political and
religious leaders are trying to per-
suade leading moderate Selim Hoss
to withdraw his resignation.

The prominent Sunni Moslem,
who holds a doctorate in economics
from Indiana University, is Leban-
on’s education and labor minister.
One recent report said that he had
threatened to resign because he
thought the government failed to
work seriously enough.

Beirut newspapers are quoting the
Shiite Moslem minister for southern
Lebanon as saying Hoss cannot
leave because that would mean the
end of the government.

Israel (UPI) — Israeli troops are
scheduled to leave Lebanon’s port
city of Sidon by Feb. 18. Talks
between Israel and Beirut to coordi-
nate the withdrawal have broken
down, and Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said yesterday that
thev mav not resume.

There are fears that Israel’s pull-
out will open the door for fighting
between Lebanese factions. Israeli
radio reports that U.N. officials
intend to ask France to provide
troops to keep the peace in the city.

WASHINGTON (UPI) —
There’s a museum in the nation's
capitol where tourists can see the
cruelties of life and death over a cen-
tury of medical history through
more than just pictures and wax
models.

Nowhere in the country except the
Armed Forces Medical Museum can
a visitor learn about elaphantiasis,
for example. On display is the actual
leg of a man who died ofthe disease.
Also at the museum, located on the
grounds of the Walter Reed Army
Medical Center, are rows of hearts
and lungs with gunshot wounds.

Tour guide Diana Monroe
admits, “It’s not for everyone.”

Visitors to the museum can see the
bullet that killed Abraham Lincoln
as well as pieces of his bone and hair.
Next to that display are the verte-
brae of‘ Lincoln's assassin, John
Wilkes Booth.

About 60 people visit the museum

Pfister leads Lady Panthers

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

Having won three . individual
events and one relay, Tracey Pfister
had what the women‘s swim coach,
David Belowich, called her best
meet of the year as Pitt upped its
record to 7-0 by defeating West Vir-
ginia 88-52 Saturday at Trees Pool.

Pfister took first place in the 200-
meter freestyle, the 200-meter back-
stroke, the 200-meter individual
medley and played a key role in the
200-meter medley relay.

“Tracey just had an outstanding
meet," said Belowich. “We had three
people out with the ﬂu and there
were a few others who weren’t up to
par, so we relied on the rest of the
team to come through and fill the
gap. Tracey did just that.”

Senior Sue Heon had a tremen-
dous swim in the 1,650-meter free-
style. Finishing with a time of
16:53.96, shejust missed the out time
for the NCAA championship meet
by a little more than two seconds.

“Sue had a remarkable swim in
the 1,650. I think she was a little
disappointed in not qualifying for
Nationals, but that was her best dual
meet time in that event of her
career,” Belowich said.

Heon also placed in two other
events. She took first place in the
500-meter freestyle and third in the
200-meter individual medley behind
Tracey Pfister and Jodi O’Neil, who
took first and second, respectively.

“When it comes down to the 200
individual medley, there are very few
teams that can match our quality
and depth,” Belowich said.

Team captain Laura Barber had a

In its second loss ofthe season,

the men’s swim team was
defeated-at West Virginia on Sat-
urday 65-48.

Senior Geoff Emore led the
Panthers in scoring, taking first-
place in both the 200-meter indi-
vidual medley and the 200-meter
backstroke.

The only other first place swim
in the meet was the final event,
the 400-meter freestyle relay,
won by freshmen Charles Lersch
and Joseph Pﬁster and sopho-
mores Tom Shaulinski and
Richard James
3112.54.

The divers had a little more
success, taking first and second
on both the one- and three-meter
boards. Todd Mulzet took first
on both boards, scoring 310.95 in
the one-meter and 345 in the
three-meter event. Mark McCor-
mick earned a second place on
both boards by scoring 304.05 on
the one-meter and 332.05 on the
three-meter.

The Panthers‘ final dual meet
of the season will be Feb. 9 at
Cleveland State. They will be at
home for the Big East Cham-
pionship Feb. 28 through March
2.

events. She took first in the I00-
meter backstroke and second in the
200-meter backstroke.

Pitt dominated the diving compe-
tition, taking first and second in
both the one- and the three-meter

events. On the one-meter board, it
was Tricia Ney taking first place
with a score of 259.05 points and
Jennifer Brown claiming second
with her score of 228.04 points. On
the three-meter board, it was Brown
taking first with her score of 271.95
and Ney placing second with 268.80
points.

“The meet looked easier than it
actually was. With the three people
out due to illness, I didn’t think we’d
dominate the way we did,” Belowich
said.

The swimmers’ next meet will be
this weekend when they host
Youngstown State. According to
Belowich, that meet is a very low-
pressure one for the team. “We have
a tough schedule, and after a while,
that can really take its toll on a team,
so it’ll be a nice break for us.”

The meet with Youngstown will 0

give the Panthers an unusual oppor-
tunity to choose their own events.
“This kind of meet gives
swimmers a chance to try some other
events,” Belowich said. “The seniors
have first choice in what events they
want to be in, and it’s down the line
to the freshmen. I’ve found that the
team really enjoys that kind of fun
meet, so we try to do it once a year.”

wanted to jump on them from the

Junior point guard Kim Tirik,
who had 11 assists in the earlier
meeting between the two teams, con-
tinued to pass circles around the
Hoyas. She finished the half with
five assists (which could have easily
been eight had it not been for some
dropped passes and missed layups.)
“She's doing what we tell her to do
and that is push the ball up the
court,” said Saurer. “She can do so
many other things but if she does
that it will help us win.”

The Pitt defense continues to be
superb, holding Georgetown to 26
points in the first half and keeping
center Allyson Westbrooks out of
the scoring column. Westbrooks,
who is a Steel Valley High School
graduate, didn’t get her first field
goal until the middle of the second
half and finished the game with only
six points. The Pitt’s l-2-“l—l zone
pressure forced the Hoyas into com-
mitting and incredible 19 turnovers
in the first half. With their first break
in high gear, the visiting Panthers
turned the steals into easy layups.

The Hoyas were led by sharp-
shooting guard Maura Gill, who had
l4 points, and forward Beth Knights
with l0. Everyone on Pitt’s squad
with the exception of Jane Plake,
who was held out of the game with
an ankle injury, got into the game
and the scoring column. Bruce ﬁn-
ished with 25 and she got help from
Kim Gannis (l 1), Lisa Fubio (9) and
Stephanie Collins and Valerie “Hol-
lywood" Halesworth, each with
eight.

Pitt’s next game will be Wednes-
day night at the Fitzgerald Field
House when they will be looking to
avenge a tough double-overtime loss
earlier in the month to the Friars of
Providence.

Wrestlers make

By Kirsten Gostony
The, Pitt News

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
has extended its record to 6-2 by
-winning their last three matches.
They began Thursday evening by
defeating Kent State in a close bout
24-22. The Panthers traveled to Ash-
land on Saturday where they were to
compete against Ashland and
Purdue. Pitt compiled a respectable
lead of 39-3 9ver Ashland before
they were forced to forfeit at heavy-
weight due to a lack of sufficient

fielding, making the ﬁnal score 39-9. ~

Purdue did not show, however, and
the forfeit gave the Panthers their
third victory of the week.

Joe lagnema (ll8 lbs.) lost to
Kent State’s Mark Adkins 8-0 but
received a win by forfeit against
Ashland. John Hnath (126)
recorded two wins. Hnath defeated
Kent State’s Dan Gnabah with a
technical fall at 5:47 and defeated his
Ashland opponent l2-5.

Against Kent State’s Jeff Gainer,
Panther Kyle Nellis ( l 34) was able to
record a fall at 4: l6, while on Satur-
day he gained a technical fall against
his opponent at 5:37. This hoists his
individual record to 14-2, with an
impressive total of five falls.

Wrestling at 142 lbs., Steve Frank
fell to Kent State’s Rick Wilson by a
score of 6-2, yet was able to rebound
by defeating his opponent on Satur-
day with a pin at 5:41. Gary Bolin
(150) recorded a technical fall
against Kent State’s Dave Yerse
when he was awarded a point for
riding time advantage. Against Ash-
land, Bolin defeated Todd Winter by
a score of 8-1.

Joe Bond (185) was also able to
compile two wins. Against Kent
State’s Forest Messner, Bond
recorded a technical fall at 4:45,
while against Ashland be defeated
his opponent 5-4 only by acquiring a
point for riding time advantage. At
l67 lbs., Panther Doug Haines fell

page 15
it 3 ina row

to opponent Ed Difeo of Kent State
8-6; however, he came back on Sat-
urday to record a fall with a time of
2:27.

Mike Tongel (177) was defeated
by Kent State’s Doug Dake, who
recorded a technical fall at 4:25.
Dake is currently ranked sixth in the
nation. On Saturday, Tongel’s
opponent defaulted due to an ankle
injury, thus he recorded six points
for the team’s effort.

Against Kent State’s Doug Baker,

Panther Ken Hackman gave a cou-.

rageous showing as he continued to
wrestle despite suffering an injury.
Unfortunately, Hackman fell to his
opponent 7-5, and his injury sent
him offto the hospital for X-rays. As
a result of the injury, he may be out
for the rest of the season. 2

On Thursday, Pitt's Curt Conner
wrestled at heavyweight, falling to
Kent State’s Dave Gibsom 12-5. On

. Saturday, he dropped to 190 lbs. but

again recorded a loss, this one to
opponent Jim Zachnar 6-2.

“In the beginning of the year, I
said the team was filled with youth.
Along with that comes a lot of heart
and enthusiasm. And I think the way
they’ve been wrestling is an indica-
tion of that,” said head coach Rande
Stottlemyer.

“My favorite saying is ‘They’re
playing their hearts out on the mat,’
and that’s only because it’s the
truth,” added assistant coach Jack
Spates. “They’ve been doing every-
thing necessary to win, and we’re
thrilled with them.”

The Panthers have now hit the
heart of their season with upcoming
matches against top-ranked oppo-
nents Navy, Lock Haven, Penn
State, Bloomsburg and Clarion. If
they wrestle as well as they have
been, they are sure to stay ahead in
the wins column.

Blowout

Lady Panthers
smother Hoyas

By Michael Bertonaschl
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s basketball
squad (1 1-7, 6-3 in the Big East) uti-
lized a swarming defense and some
sizzling outside shooting to defeat
the Georgetown Hoyas at McDo-
nough Arena 90-50.

Earlier in the season, the two
teams met at Fitzgerald Field House
and Pitt squeezed out a 69-68 vic-
tory. Saturday night’s game had no
such drama as the Panthers con-
trolled the game from the start and
coasted to an easy victory. “I think
in the first game we were a little
uptight,” said head coach Judy

Saurer. “It was our first Big East.

game of the year.”

There was nothing uptight about
the Panthers on Saturday as they
surged to an 8-0 lead before George-
town head coach Cheryle Thomp-
son called a timeout. When play

Bruce

continued from page twenty
they could be a force to be l'€CK-
oned with in the Big East
tournament. »

Bruce, meanwhile, will keep
tossing in those jumpers as she
adds to her record-breaking
totals. If she keeps up her present
pace, she will have scored around
2,400 points by the end of her
career. That’s a mark that should
stand for quite a while.

resumed, the Hoyas continued to
have problems against Pitt’s l-2-I-l
zone pressure and the lead swelled to
22-4. Atthis point, the game, for all
intents and purposes, was over. The
only drama to unfold now was Jen-
nifer Bruce chasing Clyde Vaugh-
an’s title as the all-time leading
scorer in both men's and women’s
basketball at Pitt. With six minutes
remaining in the first half Bruce
sank two free throws to notch points
13 and l4. Lisa Fubio then stole a
pass and fed Bruce on a breakaway
layup. As she went up to score the
Panther bench and some parents
and fans who had made the trip
erupted into cheers and applause.
The ball rolled around the rim and
fell out and the record was tempor-
arily put on hold. On Pitt’s next pos-
session, Bruce got loose underneath.
This time her layup attempt was
good and the bench and fans could
finally give her the applause that one
of the finest athletes ever to wear a
Pitt uniform deserved.

“It was definitely an honor,” said
Bruce. “I can’t say I wasn’t thinking
about it but I'm just glad we won.
My teammates were behind me all
the way, 100 percent. They never let
up and they kept telling me how
many I had to go." She finished with
a game-high 25 points and with at
least 10 games to go in the season,
she may put this record completely
out of reach.

For the second game in a row, the
Panthers went into the locker room
at halftime with a comfortable lead
(51-26). “The kids are doing what we
want them to do,” said Saurer. “We

Brawls, penalties mar hockey club win

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

-Fans at the Pitt-CMU hockey
game yesterday were everything but
bored as the Pittsburgh Hockey
Club held on to beat the Tartans 2-l.
Spectators may have been angry or
even confused, but they were defi-
nitely not bored.

The first period was rather
uneventful except for the first goal
of the game coming from Pitt center
Jim Lang with 36 seconds remaining
in the period. Near the beginning of
the second period, defenseman Vic
Hugo was struck in the face by the
stick ofa CMU player, leaving Hugo
with chipped teeth. No penalty was

   

calledon CM U; however, Hugo was
thrown from the game after he

attempted to retaliate. “This is the
worst reffing l‘ve ever seen,” said
Hugo, sitting in the stands after the
call. “The ref said he didn’t see it.”

After ﬁve minutes of confusion
and fruitless arguing with the refs,
the Panthers went back onto the ice,
skating much harder than before the
penalty was called on Hugo.
According to defenseman Damon
Brown, CMU came out hitting hard
and left the Panthers with no choice
but to return the favor. “That’s why
the game was so physical. CMU set
the tempo,” said Brown.

Later in the middle period, Lang
scored the Panthers’ second and
final goal of the game. The third
period brought more high-intensity
skating from both teams as the

penalties began to pile up. The next
Panther skater to be thrown from
the game was left wing Jim Owens
Jr. for a ten-minute misconduct.
Owens felt that the refs lost control
of the game but he does not deny
that he deserved this particular call.
“Some were bad calls; some were
stupid plays by us," said Owens.

Minutes later, defenseman Tom
Dieffenbach was being carried off
the ice with a knee injury. “I think we
were a little mad and a little upset,”
explained Dieffenbach after the
game. “We knew we would have to
hit like them to win. I went into the
corner to hit someone. Damon was
coming down too and I hit the booth
and twisted my knee.” Dieffenbach
was still experiencing severe pain
after the game and he isn’t sure he'll
be back on skates.

A final Pitt skater was ejected
from the game when Brown was
called on a misconduct and major
roughing. “The refs let it get out of
hand with the stick-swinging inci-
dent with Hugo. It was a buildup of
things and I lost my temper," said
Brown.

The Tartans, with penalties rival-
ing those of the Panthers, scored
their first and only goal in the third
period but the Panthers were able to
hold onto the lead and win the game.

The Pitt skaters were not bitter
after the game, aside from an occa-
sional gripe about the poor reffing.
“It wasn’t a bad game, was it?” asked
goalie Bob Mattioli, already know-
ing the answer. “It was a good game
and really good first period. All of

slows down the game." Mattioli
made some incredible saves for Pitt,
allowing the puck to pass him only
once on 17 attempts.

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club
defeated CMU 6-2 just two weeks
ago and this win brings the Panthers
to I0-2-1. This time the victory over
CMU wasn't as easy for the Pitt
skaters. “CMU really came out hus-
tling and they played a better game
this time. Overall, it was a good
hockey game for both teams,” said
Dieffenbach.

Goalie John Godwin did not play
for the Panthers yesterday but his
comment following the game basi-
cally sums up the extent ofthe game,
“It was an awesome game,

Syracuse pressure

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Not even the Great Earl ~ the
ranging sideline antic - could pull
victory from that l0-gallon foam
imitation of a Stetson of his.

Syracuse knows the Panthers
tried. Playing renegade basketball
nearly throughout, the Orangemen
and Panthers threw away game
refinements — no less the ball — in a
fashion befitting Pitt’s new-found
method of handing its leads to
opponents.

Graciously, the Orangeaccepted
the 80-75 win Saturday afternoon at
Fitzgerald Field House..They would
have it no other way, for Charles
Smith sailed by ‘Greg Monroe, giv-
ing Pitt its largest lead (55-48) and
placing Syracuse 10:58 from its third
straight defeat.

Coach Jim Boeheim, in nothing-
doing style, shaved off his sportcoat
and applied the veteran lineup that
sped his squad to the NCAAs last
year. Subbingwaned as Monroe,
Wendell Alexis and Andre Hawkins
(before fouling out) joined Rafael
Addison and Dwayne “Pearl”
Washington in administering ﬁnal
rites.

“Jim made a good move there,"
counterpart coach Roy Chipman
said. “It worked.”

The outcome pushed Syracuse to
12-3, 4-3 for tonight's Carrier Dome
happening against Georgetown. It
also left the Panthers 10-6, 2-4 and
perplexed. For the third time in five
games, theirisustained leads have
died in mid-game.

Ironically, after playing catchup
against it, Pitt pulled out a road win
over Boston College one week ago.

Otherwise Connecticut, St.
John’s, Georgetown and Syracuse
have squired away wins under no
tension at all.

Jennifer Bruce

“What we need to get is killer
instinct," said Keith Armstrong,
whose 16 points were second only to
Curtis Aiken’s 18. “When we have a
lead, we have to try to keep it. It
wasn’t that we were overconfident,
but when [Syracuse] had a lead, we
were relaxing and they were coming
hard.”

Score-wise, Pitt could seemingly
do no wrong in the first half as it
jumped out to a 35-32 halftime lead.
Aiken, Armstrong and Demetreus
Gore, a surprise producer off of the
bench with a game-total l5 points,
each contributed eight points.

But, as Chipman said not-so-
gloatingly, the lead appeared
lacking.

“Personally, we should have been
up by more than three. We had more
opportunities. We came out of the
locker room and were ﬂat. Just like
that, three fouls. Shows we’re not
playing like we should have been.”

Of the Panthers’ seven steals in the
first half, they converted for only
seven points while Syracuse's Rony
Seikaly and the Pearl combined to
both give the game away and con-
tend for a “That’s Incredible”
installment.

Seikaly, the Lebanese pivotman

, who has trouble putting English on

the ball, can block -(led with five).
Boeheim still has to teach the
youngster how to shoot, receive
passes, create space and rebound.
His three boards and five points
hardly qualify for starting status.
Meantime, the Pearl thought
nothing of his team, hitting for l8 of
his 30 points in the first half and
qualifying for a lone assist.
Amazing, isn’t it, that Addison
could knock in 16 and Alexis 13?

Boeheim didn’t think any of the

uppity showmanship by the Pearl
was funny. ~

“Dwayne played great at times,
but he played terrible at times,”
Boeheim said. “You got to be in on

Jennifer Bruce became Pitt’s
all-time leading scorer on Satur-
day when she tossed in a short
jumper against Georgetown and
eclipsed the old mark of 2,033

point performance. this one dur-

every play, but you don’t have to
score on every play. We want
Dwayne to score, but he didn't get it
to the open guy as well.”

“A lot of times you could say I
missed some plays,” Washington
said. ‘‘It’s something that happened.
Sometimes other guys are covered,
so I shot it.” _

On Seikaly, still defining the open
concept, Boeheim mentioned, “For
one thing, he hurts in pressure. He
can rebound, get the turnover, but
on offense he doesn’t know where to
go.“

Acting as an asterisk — or as a
point of information — Boeheim
also credited the Orangemen with a
half dozen or so more turnovers
than statisticians accorded them
(23). “Due to Pitt’s trapping
defense," Boeheim added.

It doesn’t matter that Pitt outstole
Syracuse 12-7, the only category in
which the Panthers bested the
Orangemen.

“When they made their come-
back, we were making things happen
defensively, trying to get steals
instead of winning the game,” Chip-
man said. “We got steals in the first
half, but they were making mistakes,
too.”

The foul mannerisms peaked
within the first 12 seconds of the
second half as Gore, Armstrong and
Chip Watkins each picked up his
third personal in that span. Several
minutes later, Addison began can-
ning l2 of his 16 total points and
Alexis ll of his 13.

“We think we can go with teams
one on one, which we can,” Darryl
Shepherd said, “but we have to be
more hesitatant. We start taking too
many chances. We were up by five;
we should have taken our time.
Instead we tried to be up by 10.”

A case in point was Gore. His
season-long streakiness from the
field continued as evidenced by 3-7

of the Hoyas. “I feel basically the
same,” the forward said yester-
day. “It’s been one of my goals."

Bruce is in her third season as
team captain and has been a
force in the Pitt attack since she
came to the program four years
ago from Carrick High School in
Pittsburgh.

This athlete played her first
two years in the shadow of Deb-
bie Lewis and Pam Miklasevich
but blossomed last year when she

Her team had some troubles
earlier in the season. Losses to
St. John’s, Villanova and Boston
College by a total of eight points
put Pitt in a tough situation, but
things have turned around now,
according to Bruce.

“We’re on a roll now,” she
said. “We're winning and we
