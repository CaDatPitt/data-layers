As the Soldiers and Sailors
lawn was closed to sunbathing to
Pitt students, so may the
|andmark—accompanying
building.

Attorney David McMullin, who
is handling the crisis on behalf of
the memorial, is not terribly op-
timistic that Soldiers and Sailors
will be able to stay open, and the
15 employees are also unsure
about the status of their jobs.

The problem is that not enough
money was budgeted for the
memorial, which is operated by
a board of managers. This board

is composed of three county

commissioners, two judges from

the Common Pleas Court and
eight veterans from the Veterans
of Foreign Wars and the Ameri-
can Legion.

A statute requires the county
commissioners to appropriate the
funds for the memorial with any
disputes being settled in the
Common Pleas Court.

”The budget gets cut year after
year,” McMullin said. At the be-
ginning of the year, $434,000
was appropriated, which, accord-
ing to McMullin, is not enough.

”The county commissioners
have not attended a board meet-
ing in four years, so they dognot
understand what is going on, and
apparently they don't want to,”
McMullin said. He explained that
the commissioners have repeat-

“/\/Iemorial faces possible shut down

edly refused requests to meet
with the Hall.

And on Dec. 31, 1987,
McMullin and the memorial
asked for a court order for addi-
tional funds. McMulIin thought
they had won the case; however,
Judge Hortos on July 5 sided with
the commissioners.

Although an appeal has been
filed, the process could take up
to a year. On Sept. 1, the
memorial petitioned the Supreme
Court, asking it to assume juris-
diction and to hold an emergen-
cy hearing, as it can do in a
matter of public interest. So far,
McMullin has not received word
on the petition.

It is estimated that the money

Signs posted near construction
sites in Salk Hall that read
”Warning Danger Cancer and
Lung Disease Hazard” have
some staff members who work in
the building worried about health
risks and dissatisfied with the ad-
ministration's concern for their
well being.

Some Salk Hall employees
have complained of suffering
from skin rashes, respiratory
problems and other allergic reac-
tions since the construction
began.

To bridge the gap between the
university and the Salk staff, a
safety committee was formed.
The staff of Salk Hall is represent-
ed by Herman Langkamp, who
works in the building's microbi—
ology department. Langkamp at-
tends ‘meetings with the

administration concerning the
reconstruction and reports back
at staff
meetings. ‘ -

According to Langkamp, the
people who work in the building
daily are ’’absolutely not” in
danger from the asbestos.

”Everything is within safe
limits,” Langkarnp said.

Certain staff members are still
skeptical. But why would they
doubt the head of their safety
committee who, like themselves,

works in the building everyday?"

”People believe their fears over
the administration's facts,” said
Dr. Robert Mundell, interim as-
sociate dean in charge of physi-
cal plant management.

’’People are inclined to believe

that the establishment will not do

them justice,” Mundell said.
Mundell blames the confusion
on ”disinformation” and rumors

FASC meets to discuss

budget and education

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Staff Writer

FAS Dean Peter F.M. Koehler
opened the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Council's first fall meet-
ing with an announcement that
the Institute for the Black Family
has been incorporated into CAS
within the department of black
community education, research
and development.

The institute, directed by Dr.
Jerome Taylor, was formerly part
of the university’s School of So-
cial Work.

In other business, FASC dis-
cussed budget constraints as well
as other matters of concern to the
faculty of CAS.

Koehler expressed concern
over the hiring of new faculty
specifically for new programs
such as the Institute for the Black
Family because ”it’s difficult to
start something new when you
have difficuly doing all the things
you have to do already.” Koeh-
ler stated the FAS did not receive
an increase in its operating budg-
et this year.

”FAS has been forced to oper-
ate at a deficit for many years,”
Koehler said. He added the
deficit for the 1987-88 year was
approximately $496,000.

CAS Dean Mary L. Briscoe not-
ed 2,500 freshmen were admit-
ted to CAS this fall, an 11.2
percent increase over last year,
while the number of CAS faculty

has remained at approximately
545. Koehler stated this translates
into an increasing faculty—student
ratio.

To address this problem, Koeh-
ler said he has discussed the pos-
sibility of eliminating the
university’s spring term with
Provost Rudolph Weingartner.
This would allow FAS to funnel
more of its funds into the fall and
winter terms. Koehler said he and
Weingartner determined it would
not be feasible to eliminate the
third term of the academic year.

Instead, Koehler proposed the
development of an improved
marketing strategy to attract stu-
dents to enroll in the spring term.
Koehler said this would allow
FAS to reduce the ”overflow” of
students in courses in the fall and
winter terms. University Presi-
dent Wesley W. Posvar would
have to approve any expansion of
the spring term.

The amount of physical space
provided for faculty members
was another concern addressed
at the meeting. Koehler said the
university compares ”woeful|y
with other major research univer-
sities” in the amount of space
provided for faculty and research-
ers. ”We are beginning to be
completely gridlocked,” he con-
tinued.

These problems will be dis-
cussed again at a full FAS meet-
ing scheduled for Oct. 20.

First woman elected as bishop of Boston diocese

BOSTON (AP) — The Rev. Bar-
bara Harris said Tuesday she was
”a little incredulous” at being _
elected the first female bishop of
the Episcopal Church, but she be-
lieves her historic status shouldn't
overshadow her work.

Some members of the church
have objected to bringing a wom-
an into the line of apostolic suc-
cession, but Episcopalian officials
said they don't expect the elec-
tion will split parishes or stall the
ratification process. .

”l have  beenelected bishop
of the church and not a symbol
or a token, and my whole empha-
sis is  on the role to which I
have been elected,” Harris said
at a press conference at St. Paul’s_
Cathedral in Boston, where she
was elected Saturday.

Pa. Supreme Court
election canceled

PITTSBURGH (AP) -— The state
Supreme Court on Tuesday can-

state Supreme and state Superior
couns

The five-sentence ruling came
in favor of Richard Sprague, a
former Philadelphia County dis-
trict attorney. Sprague argued the
state constitution allows judicial
elections only in odd-numbered
years.

The decision apparently delays
the elections until November
1989.

The high court, in a ruling
handed down only hours after
oral arguments, ordered the
secretary of the commonwealth
to remove the offices from the
general election ballot. The court
said a formal opinion would
follow.

”What is John Heinz afraid of,
I ask. Is he afraid of his record?”
the 39-year-old former Philadel-

press conference. ”Pennsylvania

Vignola and Heinz are sched-
uled to debate Oct. 18 at 7 p.m.
at the studios of WPVI-TV in
Philadelphia. The one-hour de-

College emphasizes peace studies 5o|diers

HUNTINGDON, Pa. (AP) —
Long before the subject became
trendy, the small liberal arts col-
lege of Juniata offered courses
ranging from history to geology
as part of a ”peace and conflict
studies program.”

Today, the number of peace or
conflict-resolution programs has
grown to more than 200 from
about 20 in the early 1970s, ac-
cording to Robin Crews, who
heads The Peace Studies Associ-
ation, in North Newton, Kan.

”It's a new and emerging
field,” said Rev. M. Andrew Mur-
ray, who heads the 15-year-old
program at Juniata.

Murray said the introductory
peace and conflict studies class-
es at Juniata try to dispel the
”liberal” notion that peace
comes through ”love and under-
standing” and the ”conservative”
idea of ”peace through strength.”

’’In peace studies, everything is
up for grabs. We try not to make
any careless assumptions on why
human beings organize for lethal
conflict,” said Murray, 46, the
college chaplain.

Students in the classes have

differing political views, and stu-

dents majoring in the program
are prepared to work anywhere
from the Pentagon to Green-
peace, he said.

After a recent meeting of the in-
troductory course, several stu-
dents listed their career interests
as law, international relations,
communications and education.

Crews said one reason for the
growth in peace studies is an in-
creasing interest in finding new
wa s to solve conflicts without

using military force.

”The empirical record we have
before us is [that] violence
doesn't work,” said Crews, who
is also director of the Kansas
Peace Institute at Bethel College.
”Military attempts at conflict
resolution are entirely unsuc-
cessfu|.”

Another reason for the growth
might be that many professors be-
ginning the programs came of
age intellectually during the tur-
bulent 1960s and early 1970s,
Crews said.

Robert J. Murray, a professor of
American history at Penn State
University, said professors teach-

to be careful not to let their own

”There is a danger for them to’

Murray said. ”If they become

The commissioners have been
quoted as saying that they are not
going to give in.

However, since the story was
made public last week, the com-
missioners said that if the
memorial needed money, all they
had to do was ask. McMullin
pointed out that even after the
suit, the memorial received no
money.

Despite the fact the commis-
sioners appear to be backing
down to public demands, accord-
ing to McMullin, no real progress
has been made. McMullin is puz-
zled by this. ”Last year, 255,000
people used the Hall. ...If you
were a politician, why would you
take on the veterans? There are
200,000 veterans in Allegheny
County. Why get them angry by
closing the Hall?” McMullin can

but said, ’’It almost seems it was
intentional to let the Hall close.’’
The commissioners could not be

This subway train station,

As a result of the citizens’

According to Mundell, all of
the information concerning build-
ing safety that is given to him is
passed on to Salk Hall em-
ployees.

However, two problems can
arise in the dissemination of in-
formation which can cause un-
certainties among the staff. Either
a person responsible for getting
the word out neglects to do so,
or someone begins telling others
that the safety information is not
true, according to Mundell.

”Every time I get information,
i send it out [to the staff]. I have
even hand-carried safety figures
around to those who are very

public.

Despite safe asbestos levels in
the building, some of the person-
nel at Salk Hall have experienced
physical reactions that they link
to the construction.

According to Georgette Johns,
a Salk Hall employee, she has
suffered respiratory difficulties.
She saw a physician who ac-
knowledged that she neither
smokes nor has allergies and at-
tributed the condition to dust ir-
ritation from the construction.

People who have had respira-
tory and sinus problems prior to
the building's renovation are es-
pecially irritated by the dusty en-
vironment of Salk Hall. A

New welfare bill
a worthy proposal

Before adjourning, Congress is expected to pass a major
federal welfare reform bill that would switch the emphasis

from giving money to the poor to attempting to educate, train

and get jobs for welfare parents.
The plan, called Job Opportunities and Basic Skills, would
costvan estimated $3.34 billion. It targets welfare parents with

children over the age of three, and its major concern is push-

ing these parents to get jobs. It requires that one adult in a ’
two-parent welfare family must perform 16 hours a week of
community work, on-the-job training or some other kind of
work. People under the age of 25 could enroll in an educa-
tion program instead of working. There is also a portion
which requires automatic deduction of child support pay-
ments from the paycheck of the absent parent.

— The JOBS bill is the first significant change in the welfare
system since Reagan took office, and it is a potentially suc-
cessful andworthwhileone. As the saying goes: Give a man
a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to fish and you

feed him for a lifetime.

A life supported by the government is not much of a life.

‘What this bill would do is not only lower unemployment

and eventually lower the cost of welfare for the government,
but it would give some of the welfare parents a new hope
and new independence even while requiring one of them

to have a job. .

. We applaud the efforts of all the congressmen and '
representatives who worked» to make this bill possible and
negotiated for weeks to make it passable in both the House
and the Senate. A bill of this kind can only be a step in the

right direction.

Tired of being pushedaround  

I caught myself abbreviating my
first name on a cover letter the
other day -— someone might
think I’m a woman, and I would
really like to get a job someday.

Somewhere between fact and
fantasy lies the idea that I'm equal
to any man. Because I'm a wom-
an, he is, of course, innately phys-
ically stronger in most ways. But
is he innately’ more mentally
capable? I think not. I've compet-
ed competently in class and work
situations with men. Yet when I
graduate, I'll have to expect to
make 60 cents to his every dollar.

In other words, while I'm do-
ing the same job —— identical in
every aspect — the man will
make 40 percent more than I will
on every dollar. ‘

I wander through drunken
stages of debates with male
friends who all think I'm crazy.
I rage that I'm a minority, hired
only to fill a quota. I argue that
I'll never know whether I'm be-

ing hired because of my ability or I

because 90 percent of their em-
ployees were men and the

government was breathing down V

their backs.
My friends pour me another

beer and tell me that I should be
be quite satisfied knowing that I'll
only have to work until I get mar-
ried and raise a family — my true
destination in life as a woman.

Have we come a long way,
baby?

No, but we sure do look great
in those ads.

Actually, we have made con-
siderable progress. Back in the
18005, if a woman showed any
sign of independence, the male
of the family rushed her off to the
doctor. And men such as Issac
Baker Brown, a gynecologist,
claimed to have success during
his peak years of activity
(1866-1867) in curing antisocial
behavior of various kinds by prac-
ticing the surgical removal of the
clitoris. No wonder women
never said anything back then.

These clitoridectomies, as they
were called, functioned as a cure
for any sign of independence,
sexual excitement, intelligence,
or undesired skill, other than the

Is the use of fetuses for medical research

As those who attempt to
separate the morality of selling
poison gas to the Nazis from the
Nazis’ use of it to kill millions of
Jews, a panel of doctors, ethicists
and theologians are now trying to
separate the moral questions sur-
rounding abortion from the
research involving the tissue of
aborted babies.

In approving the use of the
aborted fetus for research, a fed-
eral advisory panel last week
passed without objection a draft
statement that further. devalues
human life and brings us even
closer to the day when only those
determined by an authoritarian
elite to be "fit” and "wanted"
will be allowed to survive.

In his book, Medical
Holocaust: Exterminative Medi-
cine in Nazi Germany and Con-
temporary America, Professor
William Brennan of St. Louis
University notes that many phy-
sicians who collaborated with
Hilter conducted experiments in-
volving fetal hearts and ‘Jewish
brains. The hearts, notes Bren-
nan, were mounted in a ther-
mostatically controlledl bath,
"surviving for hours without any

change in their spontaneous con-
traction rate." Of course, the
abortions which produced the fe-
tuses were perfectly legal at the
time, as they are now in Ameri-
ca. And, as now, they were con-
ducted in the name of

L ”advancing” medical science-

The experiments on Jews were

CAL
THOMAS

justified on the grounds thatJews
(like fetuses) were sub-human,
and conducting experiments on
their bodies, which had just ar-
rived from the gas chambers (the
fresher the tissue, the better, say
contemporary doctors about the
aborted), would eventually allevi-
ate pain and suffering in others.
The contemporary argument is
that fetal experiments should be
allowed so that people suffering
from Parkinson's disease and
other maladies can be helped.
Inhumanities are often per-
petrated in the name of the
highest humanitarian and social
principles. That is what makes
them so dangerous, because it is

easy to be blinded by the light of
good intentions and to ignore the
darkness that will certainly
follow.

The federal advisory panel
sought to make fetal experimen-
tation more acceptable by
promising to write guidelines that
would prohibit the selling of baby
parts for the purpose of making
a profit. Good luck. If people
have no qualms about abortion
or fetal experimentation, what
makes us think that they have
enough moral strength left over
to resist the temptation to make
money?

In a story published in the Feb.
29, 1976 edition of The Washing-
ton Post, it was disclosed that be-
tween 1972 and the middle of
1974, D.C. General Hospital's
obstetric and gynecology depart-
ment sold the bodies and organs
of babies aborted by hysterotomy
to Flow Labs of Rockville, Md.
Flow then used them to produce
cell cultures, which were sold to
medical pharmacological
researchers and firms. It was also
revealed that $75 was paid to
D.C. General for each body sup-
plied. The money was spent for

such things. as departmental
equipment, a TV set, attendance
at education meetings and soft
drinks and cookies for visiting
professors. The hosipitaI’s pathol-
ogy department had also been
trafficking in the preparation and
sale of aborted human bodies
and organs to commercial firms
for 10 years. In return, it received
$68,000.

Is fetal experimentation worthy
of a civi-Iized people? Are» we
now into recycling body parts the
way we recycle bottles?

What's next, for there will cer-
tainly be a ”next" just as abor-
tion’s next was infanticide. What
would be wrong with addressing
the world's hunger problems by
legalizing cannibalism? Too in-
comprehensible? Give it time. All
incomprehensibles become com-
prehensible when moral founda-
tions are sufficiently destroyed.
How long ago was it when abor-
tion was incomprehensible?

The federal advisory panel is
behaving like Pontius Pilate, try-
ing to wash its hands of innocent
blood. But its members cannot
escape history's judgement, any
more than could Pilate, or could

The Pitt women's volleyball
team went on the rampage last
night against St. Francis and

' Robert Morris.

In the first match of the even-
ing against St. Francis, the Lady
Panthers came away with a 15-3,
15-6 and 15-2 victory.

In a match marked by frequent
Pitt substitutions, All-American
candidate Denise Frawley paced
the Lady Panthers with five kills

in two games.

Pitt's domination continued in
the second match as the team
won in convincing fashion (15-0,
15-5 and 15-10). Once again, the
Lady Panthers substituted fre-
quenﬂy.

Spearheading the attack for the
Lady Panthers were Lori Silk and
Kelly Matheis. Silk bothered by a
bad back was still able to rack up
five kills in only one game against
the Colonials. Matheis saw action
in two games in tallying her five
kills.

Smith, Lane get ready

East gets ready for '88

For those of you who missed it:

0 Charles Smith, the former Pitt
All-American center who was
drafted in the first round of the
NBA draft by the Los Angeles
Clippers, has a little numbers
conflict.

Smith, who has worn No. 32

Bridgeport, Conn., might be play-

ing without his trademark digits
for the first time, considering that
jersey is occupied by an NBA
veteran.

Of course, it's only Greg Kite,
so maybe Smith will see the num-
ber that Pitt retired in his last
home game against Seton Hall.

0 Jerome Lane has encoun-
tered the same problem with the
Denver Nuggets. Lane, however,
probably won't see No. 34, con-
sidering Danny Schayes occupies
it right now.

Actually, he's lucky he's play-
ing for the Nuggets at all. All-Star
forward Calvin Natt took a salary
cut so Denver could sign Lane to

_a $200,000 one-year contract.

Otherwise, he may have been
playing in Europe. .

0 Speaking of pro basketball,
the Los Angeles Clippers open
their season against the Philadel-
phia 76ers, the same team that
drafted Smith, only to trade him
to the Clippers.

0 With the loss of Smith, Lane
and swingman Demetreus Gore,
who was drafted by Tulsa of the
CBA, Pitt's fortunes don't shine as
brightly as they have in the past
few seasons. But one thing the
Panthers do have going for them
is the experience of four fresh-
men starters from last season.

Point guard Sean Miller, guard-
forward Darelle Porter, center-
forward Bobby Martin and guard
Jason Matthews gained invalua-
ble experience, as Miller, Mat-
thews and Porter all entered the

starting lineup ‘throughout the
season.

What about the rest of the Big
East? Georgetown could be the
preseason No. 1, with freshman
phenom Alonzo Mourning and
Olympic point guard Charles
Smith guiding the way. Syracuse,
featuring Derrick Coleman and
all-everything point-guard Sher-
man Douglas, can never be
counted out, and Billy Owens of
Carlisle, Pa., should prove to be
invaluable to the Orangemen.
Villanova should have another
solid season with the likes of for-
ward Doug West and greatly im-
proved center Tom Greis
returning, as well as 6—foot—9
freshman All-American Marc
Dowdell.

Seton Hall is once again a team
to contend with, despite the loss
of forward Mark‘Bryant and guard
James Major; 250 pound center

Ramon Ramos returns, as does

the ”Muggsy" Bogues of the Big
East, Pookey Wigington.

The surprise of the Big East this
season should be the Connecticut
Huskies. UConn won the NIT last
year on the strength of team ef-
fort and the inside moves of
center Cliff Robinson.

But the Huskies are loaded.
They also return guards Phil

. Gamble, Tate George and Steve

Pikiell, and forwards Willie
McCloud, Murray Williams and
Lyman DePriest.

The incoming class is also im-
pressive, featuring highly regard-
ed guard Chris Smith of
Bridgeport and two huge centers
in 6-11 Dan Cyrulik and 7-0,
240-pound Marc Suhr of West
Germany.

With Dana Barros at the helm,
Boston College is always a threat,
and the Eagles will also see for-
ward Steve Benton and eight
other players returning.

New coach Rick Barnes has a
great deal of rebuilding to do at
Providence. He returns three
players who averaged over 10
points per game —— Darryl Wright,
Marty Conlon and 1987 All-Big
East Freshman Team member Eric
Murdock — but loses 27 points
per game with the graduation of
Delray Brooks and Steve Wright.

St. John's may have the hardest
time competing of all the Big East
schools. The Redmen return only
two valuable players in forward
Jayson Williams and forward
Matt Brust, but every player may

The entire Pitt team saw action
last night with the exception of
Heather Hollands who was ill.
Despite the frequent substitu-
tions, the Lady Panthers were
able to maintain a high degree of
intensity throughout the two
matches.

With the two wins, Pitt's win-
ning streak was extended to six
matches. In each of those
matches the Lady Panthers have
won in the minimum three
games.

Sophomore defensive end Nelson Walker (94) has been a big help to the Panther defense.

Injury riddled defense doesn’t
lose much with Walker starting

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

The Pitt defense is loaded
with injuries right now.
Sophomore tackle Marc Spin-
dler, nine tackles through the
first two games this season but
only two tackles in limited ac-
tion against WVU last week, is
less than 100 percent because
of a hip contusion. Freshman
linebacker Ricardo McDonald
recorded 10 tackles in the first
two games but only one
against WVU, due to a
sprained ankle.

Both should be ready this
Saturday when the Panthers
travel to Boston College.

Senior end Burt Grossman
sprained his ankle against
Ohio State, and it is not
known whether he will be
able to play against BC.

”Burt still found his ankle a

little tender [Monday] night,”
Pitt coach Mike Gottfried said.
”Right now, it's a day to day
thing with him.”

All three of these players are
key parts to the Pitt defensive
puzzle. The Pitt defense is ex-
pected to suffer because of the
injuries.

Now, in steps sophomore
defensive end Nelson Walker.
Walker has been used as a
backup so far during his Pitt
career. Then Grossman went
down, and Walker was pen-
ciled in as the starter.

”When Burt is there, we ro-
tate [sub in and out to give the
players a rest],” Walker said.
”When he wasn't there [last
week against WVU], we didn't
rotate. As the game wore on,
we sort of wore down and got
tired.

”Burt has helped me a lot.
I know that sooner or later, I'm

going to have to learn to play
without him around. Right
now, I can't wait for him to
come back. I'll be glad when

, he comes back.”

Walker started his first game
against WVU and recorded
four tackles, pushing his total
to 12 for the year.

Walker graduated from
nearby Ringgold High School.
After his senior season, Walk-
er was named All-State as well
as All-Washington County.
Collegiate Sports of America
named Walker to its All-
American team, and USA To-
day named him a second team
All-American. In his high
school career, Walker had 178
solo tackles.

Before games, Walker
prefers to keep to himself in-
stead of being a cheerleader in
the locker room.

Please see Walker, page 8

’’I don't like to talk a lot be-
fore games,” Walker said. ’’I
just try to concentrate on what
I have to do. Try to get myself
mentally prepared. I don't
really do anything special.”

Although Grossman is better
known, Walker gives the Pan-
thers a little extra speed on the
end. ‘

”Nelson is one of those guys
who gives you 100 percent on
every p|ay,” Grossman said.
”Last week he filled in very
well. In fact, he played a great

”Nelson is going to be a
great player before he leaves,”
cornerback Alonzo Hampton
said. ”He works really hard
during practice, and when it
gets to the game, it shows. He
gives it all he has for every
play that he's out there.”

Cornerback Cornell Hollo-

”Nelson is a hard-nosed
player. I know the inside job
is going to get done when he's
on my side of the field. He
goes out all the time. Some-
times that can hurt him, but he
still does it. It helps the

gives an example to everyone
else.”

fine.

Iohnson’s gold turns to
tin as steroid scandle
ta rnishes record victory

By James Litke
AP Sports Writer

SEOUL, South Korea — Ben
Johnson always ran like a man
possessed. Now, it turns out, at
least part of the time he was.

His accomplishments, which
blazed as bright as the Olympic
flame, have been extinguished,
his throne abdicated, his ever-
faster dance along the periphery
of time stopped cold.

And his pockets, which would
have been lined with gold, have
been turned inside out.

At 3 a.m. Tuesday in Seoul,
Canadian chef de mission Carol
Ann Letheren walked into John-
son's hotel room as he sat, al-
ready disconsolate, surrounded

l

by his mother, his sister, his
coach and his manager.

Letheren asked for the gold rne—
dal and the 26-year-old Johnson,
never articulate but now mute,
handed it over.

”My reading of Ben's reaction
is that, number one, he was com-
pletely in a state of shock,” she
said. ”At that point in time he still
did not comprehend the sit-
uation.”

The International Olympic
Committee was even then
preparing its statement, readying
a grave face to turn to the world
and make Johnson's shame
public.

Johnson's handlers, perhaps
with his input, were at the same
time preparing a tale of sabotage
— a water bottle spiked with a
’’yellow gooey substance.”

Ben Johnson can still run, Lord
knows, but he can't hide.

’’I’m deeply sorry,” said Carl
Lewis, the gold medal he inherit-
ed surely cheapened in the
bargain. ,

’’I feel sorry for Ben and for the
Canadian people. Ben is a great
competitor and I hope he is able
to straighten out his life and
return to competition.”

The second item on Lewis’
wish list won't come true for at
least two years, even though
Johnson's fall from grace may
chasten other athletes enough
that the use of performance-
enhancing drugs in the sport will
be cleaned up considerably by
the time he gets back.

”This will change the history of
the Olympics,” said Edwin
Moses, the tvvo-time Olympic
champion, world record-holder
in the 400-meter hurdles and
long an outspoken critic against
drug use by athletes. ”This will
change a lot of people's lives.”

For Ben Johnson, that day may
come too late. Sprinters have an
intense but notoriously short life
span. They also need a flag to run
under, and Ben Johnson will
never compete again under the
red and white Canadian maple
leaf.

Fact and fiction are loaded with
tales of good men bought for the
right price. Butjohnson may not
even avail himself of that conso-
lation.

Many of the contracts signed
with commercial sponsors that
were to enrich Johnson an esti-
mated $5 million to $10 million
in the next five years also have
clauses designed for just such
transgressions.

And how quickly
punished the transgressor.

they

Even as Johnson was airborne,
the Canadian Olympic Associa-
tion said his $650—a—month sup-
plement had been cut off, and
Kyodo Oil Co. of Japan an-
nounced it would take down
promotional pictures of him in

6,500 gas stations around the

country and seek a refund of fees
covering the end of his contract.

A Finnish dairy had no such
recourse, but said it would with-
draw commercials showing John-
son autographing the cap of an
admiring youngster.

Steroids have been a

.problem even before

the Seoul Olympics

By Charles J. Hanley

Associated Press Writer

SEOUL, South Korea —— The ana-
bolic steroid, breakfast of muscle-
gmen, has emerged from the
shadows of the weightlifting gym.
It can now be a distance run-
ner’s last ounce of strength, a
hockey star's power play, a relay
team's fifth man.

And the discovery that Canadi-
an sprinter Ben Johnson, world
superstar, relied on this illicit elix-
ir in his gold—medal victory in the
100-meter dash ensures that the
drug dilemma will remain on the
Olympics’ center stage for years
to come. I I

The scandal of performance-

Benhancing drugs first tainted the

Olympics at Munich in 1972.
The problem, authorities agree,
has grown since. .

Prince Alexandre de Merode,
head of the Olympic medical
commission, estimates that 6 per-
cent of the world's top athletes
use steroids or other banned
drugs.

But other observers, down
there in the locker rooms or out

‘on the playing fields, would put

the figure higher. J

”Everybody uses drugs,” says
one African sprinter, Horace
Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone.
”These guys will do anything to
win a gold medal,” said Canadi-
an fencer Stephen Angers.

The lnternational Olympic
Committee, in its continuing
struggle to rein in drug use, will

I present an Olympic charter on

doping to world sports ministers
meeting in Moscow in Novem-
ber. It calls for more help by in-
dividual governments in cracking
down on athletes’ abuse of drugs.

The IOC and other sports or-
ganizations ban more than 3,700

‘. substances, but anabolic steroids

are at the top of the most—wanted
list.

These organic chemicals can
increase the muscle mass in ath-
Ietes as they train. They also have
serious side effects, including per-
sonality changes, kidney mal-
function and prostate
inflammation.

Weightlifters for years have

3+ popped steroid pills or taken in-

jections to give them a boost
toward the record books.

But when Johnson's urinalysis
”tested positive” and his gold
medal was stripped from him
Tuesday, the first such disqualifi-
cation of a medal-winning Olym-
pic sprinter, it made clear to the
world what many in sports knew:
Steroids are becoming the drug of
choice in many arenas.‘

Even before the Games, the
Seoul Olympics were touched by
the drug problem.

American swimming star Angel
Myers, a medal hopeful in five
events, was dropped from the
U.S. team when a urinalysis de-
tected signs of steroid use.

One of the first Olympic
casualties, in 1972, was another
American swimmer, and he was
the victim of his team doctors’
mistakes.

Rick DeMont, a 16-year-old
from California, won the
400-meter freestyle at the 1972
Munich Olympics by one-
hundredth of a second over Aus-
tralian Brad Cooper. But the
young swimmer tested positive
for ephedrine and was disquali-

fied. The American doctors had
not realized that an anti—asthma
drug taken by DeMont since
childhood contained the banned
substance.

At the 1976 Innsbruck Winter
Games, ephedrine again tripped
up an Olympian.

Galina Kulakova, a great Soviet
cross-country skier, won a bronze
medal in the 5-kilometer Nordic
event but was disqualified be-
cause she used a nasal spray con-
taining ephedrine. She was
allowed to compete in other
events, however, and won a gold
and a bronze.

Later that year, at the 1976
Montreal Olympics, tough IOC
screening decimated the weight-
lifting ranks. One Polish and two
Bulgarian medal winners were
stripped of their medals for drug
use, and four other lifting compe-
titors, including Americans Philip

Grippaldi and Mark Cameron,

Water-based drug /ohnson used
could cause user big problems

By Darrell Christian

AP Sports Editor

SEOUL, South Korea —
Scratch another ”safe” steroid
from the sports scene.

Ben Johnson, in all likeli-

I hood, took the popular pills

called stanozolol with him
into track exile.

Johnson, the world's most
infamously fast human, wasn't
the first Olympian in Seoul to
be caught using the steroid,
but he was the one who blew
its cover.

He was stripped of his gold
medal and world record in the
100-meter dash after traces of
the drug were found in his
post—race urine sample.

And that, says the chief
medical officer of the U.S.
Olympic Committee, should
be enough to convince ath-
Ietes once and for all that

stanozolol is not the undetec-
table steroid they might have
thought it was.

’’It has been in the past. It
isn't anymore," said Dr.
Robert Voy. ’’It’s like the rest
of them. It was difficult (to de-
tect) up to a year and a half
ago.”

Stanozolol is a water-based
steroid taken oral-Iy that, ac-
cording to a U.S. Olympic
Committee brochure, stays in
the body up to six weeks, not
the eight months for fat-
soluble types that are injected.

That made stanozolol in par-
ticular favor with athletes who
wanted an extra edge and
thought they could fool Olym-
pic laboratories.

In Johnson's case, it was fast

enough to run the 100 in a .

blurring 9.79 seconds, four-
hundredths of a second off his
old world record.

Johnson was the third gold
medalist and seventh person
overall caught for banned
drugs in Seoul. Kalman Csen-
geri of Hungary, who finished
fourth in 75—kiIogram weight-
lifting, also tested positive for
stanozolol and was dis-
qualified.

”We've seen about 15 posi-
tive cases of this drug in the
last two or three years," said
Dr. Robert Dugal, a Canadian
member of the IOC medical
commission.

Manufactured in the United
States and several European
countries, it is a prescription
drug that Dugal said should be
used medically in ”very, very

specific cases of one or two *

types of anemia.” ,
”|t’s a message to athletes
A they cannot fool around
regardless ofwhat their gurus
tell them," Voy said.

were also disqualified.

Organizers at the 1980
Moscow Olympics, boycotted by
most western countries, said no
athletes tested positive for drug
use. But many observers were
skeptical. One big winner, East
German shot putter llona Slupia-
nek, who broke the Olympic
record in Moscow, had been
forced to sit out an earlier season
when she was caught taking
steroids.

In the Los Angeles in 1984
Games boycotted by the Soviet

bloc, officials disqualified 11 ath-
letes for drug use.

One was Swedish wrestler
Thomas Johansson, who lost the
gold medal to American Jeff Blat-
nick in the super heavyweight
class, and was later stripped of his
silver because he tested positive
for steroids.

The Finnish distance runner
Martti Vainio was another
casualty in 1984. He placed sec-
ond to Italian Alberto Cova in a
tightly contested 10,000-meter
race but lost his silver because
traces of an anabolic steroid were
found in his system.

At this year's Winter Games, in
Calgary, Alberta, the steroid scan-
dal reached a new sport, ice
hockey. Poland's best player,
Jaroslaw Mirowiecki, failed the
test and was barred.

De Merode, medical commis-
sion chief, says authorities must
scramble to keep up with the in-
genuity and technology of those
involved in the sports drug busi-
ness. He now fears advances be-
yond steroids.

”Tomorrow,” he said, ”there
will be another drug problem,
more complicated and probably
involving some genetic manipu-
Iation.”

Michael Porter and Greg ”Boo

Marco Baldi signed a pro contract

Also, All-American Chuck

The Redmen do have potent

The Big East was a recruiting‘

seem to have been excluded. Pitt
picked up only one player, for-
ward Gilbertlohnson, who is ac-
tually a JUCO transfer from
Lees-McRae J.C. in North
Carolina.

Pitt will have to depend heavi-
ly upon their young players and;
hope that Rod Brookin, one of
the most dangerous scoring
threats in the Big East two seasons
ago, can stay academically
healthy. And 1987 Prop 48
casualty Brian Shorter will be ex-
pected to fill the hole left by the
departed Lane.
