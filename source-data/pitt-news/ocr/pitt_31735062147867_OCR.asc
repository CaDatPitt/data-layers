It is generally felt that the future
of w0m_en’s ~athletics at Pitt lies‘ in
the Women’s Athletic Association...
This is a young organization, hav-
ing been in existence in its present
state for onllly the last year.

The association has arranged for
two convocations each year‘ for the
general purpose of advancing ath-
letics. These have both been well
attended and on these occasions
agitation has been started for _a.
girls’ c'ne'erleader, a more vital in-
terest aroused in girls’ basket ball,
and a. broader understanding of the
importance of athletics. commuui-g
cated to the women of the student
body‘. A “Health Week" campaign
was conducted under the auspices
of the W. A. A., a. party in the form
of an indoor track meet, and a hike
were given and ﬁnanced by the asso-
ciation.

Everything is ready for the Home
Concert of the University Band on
Wednesday, April 5. The program has
been completed and Director William
Gregory ‘is prepared to put onethe
best thing, along musical lines that
has ever‘ been attempted by a. Pitt.
organization. Gregory is well satisﬁed
with the results of the rehearsals and
is confident that the ‘audience will
appreciatethe band"‘s‘ efforts. Espe-
cial attention has been paid to the
preparation of a program which will
appeal to all. “Classical” music is
combined with some up-to-date popu-
lar numbers into a. well-balanced re-
cital. -

,The band has often been classed
as one of the best student organiza-
tions in the United -States and has
compared very favorably with every
other like organization with which it
has come in contact. Critics in the

'East were favorably impressed with’

the band on the trips which it took
with the football team. Alumni are
big meters for the band and are ex-
pected to turn out in full force at the
concert.

Student Manager J. L... ‘Christian
has worked hard to make the band a.
successful organization and» is direct-
ing the sale of tickets. He is being
assisted by Faculty Adviser Schramm.
This is Mr. Schramm’-s fourth year
as adviser and the success of the
band is due ‘in a great measure to his
interest and guidance.

The ‘soloists for the concert are

zations it has been necessary to
have the funds to ﬁnance the Wom-
en’s Athletic Association. This was
attempted by charging dues oi‘ 50
cents foreac-h member, and no other
means have been resorted to. How-
ever, at this timethe ‘plans for a
circus which ‘will assist ﬁnancially
and provide a unique social function,
it is. expected, will solve the pro-
blem. Tickets for the show will be
on sale soon at a charge of 35 cents,
and the campus will be canvassed by
potential acrobats, equestriennes and
clowns.

The present auditorium is not large

WHAT MAKES umvansrrv
/ spmrrz

high school we heard much about
“school spirit.” Our teachers asked
us to write themes on the subject and
we defined it as everything from
crowd, contagion at. an athletic con-

. test to the faithful pursuance of the

high ideals of sch_olarship which we
were supposed to have. Now that we

_ p are men and women in a university. -

the ‘question can still be asked’, and
the answer is still as hard to find‘.
School spirit in high school is con-
ceived to apply only to those activ-
ities in which the entire studentbody
takes a*’part, and therein it makes the
greatest distinction between the same
name in the university.* Every act

is expected to be guided by this
vague vision called “school spirit.‘ In
high‘ school we liked. to think that
our own little organizations were the

when we went forth to cheer the foot-
ball team on,.'or when we were asked
to support the school annual. In the
university we like. to think, whether
we practice our ‘belief -or not, that-
.school spirit is working. all the time,
in each act that relates to the
campus. _ L

We cannot define university spirit.
tryas we may. To some it may pre-
clude the sort of courage ‘which
makes our athletes struggle even
unto exhaustion for a mere ribbon or
two in the name of their institution.
It may mean to others the indomit-
able strength of will which makes us
refuse to quit any project until it is
successfully conipleted. But to all it
means at least the heart of the
school, the guiding hand which makes
us continue when we would hesitate,
and malresus work when we would
shirk. It is the subconscious idea
which makes us think of the school
when we plan somethingwhich re-
quires the labor of but a few, for we
know that there is a. something which
can be called school spirit.

Many of us have much to learn if
our school spirit is to be developed
to a. higher plane. We mean here
that there is a prevailing epidemic of
personalism, in which students do and

cogitate - about T the ‘- effect" on the
school. We have many organizations

Alternatmg,.Current Transformer

There ..is« nothing that compares with i elec-
tricity for the economical transmission of power. -
As a matter of -fact, energy in any other form can
be economically transmitted only f or the shortest
distances. If a/power need develops, and its
location is more than a few hundred yards from
the power house, the engineer at once turns to
the electrical method for cheap and reliable
Ltransinissioii. . T T ‘ . l

. To the thousands who are living their lives in
-the earlier days of the Electrical Age, it probably
seems. that this situation . must have always
existed. But actually, there is many a man with
no gray in his hair can recall the days when
electric light and power were literally unknown.

There is no room to discuss allthe varied as-

one of the great fundamentals the has led to the ,
use of alternating current transmission for about
95% of the electrical systems now invuse has been
its great economy, as compared to other systems,
in the transmission of power. And the trans-
Jormer, itself, is the heart of the alternating
current system. . ’
It permits a small current, at high voltage, to
be transformedrto a large current atilow voltage,
or vice versa, through the use of simple, immobile
apparatus, and [thus supplies the essential factor

in electrical transmission.

William Stanley is remembered because it was
he who commercially developed transformers of
high efficiency and satisfactory regulating qua1i--
ties. He brought out the ﬁrst system in which
the transformers were connected  parallel,
across a constant-potential system, instead of
the series operation used by Gaulard and Gibbs.
The system embodying this principle was put
into operation at Great Barx'ingtoIi,.;Mass.,-‘on
March 16, 1886, and has been the standard
method ever since. - - T A

Thus brieﬂy is recorded the history of an-
other ‘contribution of the Westinghouse engi-
neering organization to the electricalarlz; since
all the transformers which are made today are
built upon the same general principles as those
first constructed to embody Wi1liamT Sta.nley’s
inventions.

° In the o‘l.’osi~ng contest of the ‘sea-
son, the Pitt girls’ basket ball team
defeated the Thiel College tossers
at This-l last Saturday, 23 to 10. The,
game Lwas far from ‘being a. ﬂoor
classic. The Panthers outplayed their

opponents ‘individually and from the

first few minutes of play maintained.
a. big ‘lead in the score. ‘

Edith Laiarus, ‘playing her final
game of Pitt basket ball, did some
briillliant works at . side-center and
later at center. “Ethel James, also a
‘Senior, completed her third year of
varsity lball in a reliable: manner.

0live‘Wi1t, at forward, innocently
caused muchl amusement when, after
an. unexpected contact, the bodyef
her‘ opponent described a -complete
arc ‘in the air. This demonstration
of jut jitsi was intﬁlipreted by the
referee as premeditated and Olive
‘Was disqualiﬁed for “unnecessary
roughn”ess,” although the referee ad-
mitted later that the little Pitt fia-
vorite did not have a. ‘_‘vicious face."
