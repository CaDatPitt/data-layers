Pitt might face multi-
million budget deﬁcit

Byjennifer Calabrese
Senior Sta1)"IVriter ‘

Pitt could be facing its tightest
budgetyear since the debt—ridden
19603, according to University
Provost Donald Henderson.

Unless the state legislature and
Governor Robert Casey amend
the governor’s proposed tuition-
cap plan and provide a larger
commonwealth appropriation
than the $133.5 million Currently
being proposed for the university,
Pitt will face a $9.5 million to $12
million shortfall, ” Henderson said
as he related Pitt President Wesley
Posvar’s statement to a senate
council meeting in Posvar’s
absence on Monday.

The legislature is expected to
vote on Casey's proposed budget
in mid-June, according to
Henderson. Pitt has been waiting
for a ﬁnal word on the state
budget since January, when
Posvar instituted a hiring freeze
in anticipation of a low
appropriation. Since then, Pitt
leaders have made several trips
to Harrisburg in attempts to
convince the legislature to give
Pitt an appropriation closer to
the $147.9 million requested.

“[Recently] I spent a couple of
days in Harrisburg visiting with
legislators. I came out of it with
a very grim feeling about the
prospects for next year  [and
through] the next term of office
for this governor,” Henderson
said.

“One thing for sure was that

9 nobody held out any prospects

4%

.31‘

for extra money [in Harrisburgl.”

The recommended
appropriation is a result of a
deficit the state budget may be
facing. Should the proposed
budget go through, the
requirements of the governor’s
tuition-cap incentive plan will be

the deciding factors between a
$ 12 million or $9.5 million shortfall
for Pitt.

Currently under the plan, which
attempts to give incentives to
schools to keep tuition low, the
university would receive $100
from the state for each full—time,
in-state undergraduate student as
a reward for holding the tuition
hike to $100 per student or less.

“This [proposed tuition cap] is
one-of the major threats to our
fiscal well-being. Using the
proposed formula, Pitt would face
a ‘$12 million budget deﬁcit and
be limited to 2.2 percent tuition
increases. If we were allowed to
raise tuition by 6 percent and [the
incentive] was not limited to full-
time students, our deﬁcit would
be reduced to about $9.5 million,”
Henderson said.

The $147.9 million
appropriation T Pitt asked for
would allow the university to
give faculty and staff a 7.4 percent
salary raise and allow Pitt to pay
$4 million in increased fringe-
benefit costs. Other increases the
university must provide include
renovations and maintenance.

University administrators have
not recently commented on how
Pitt might deal with the shortfall,
but in February Posvar told Pitt’s
Board of Trustees, “We will
achieve whatever remedies we
can. We will delay maintenance
and renovations; we will make
reallocations [to deal with
expected shortfalll.” _

Student Government Board
Presidentjulie Shepard expressed
her concern about possible tuition
increases to the senate.

“As we are presuming that there
will be tuition increases once the
state budget is decided, students
would like to see those as low as
possible,” Shepard said.

A campus phone-in information
system, T elefact, has gained
approval from the Student
Government Board's Allocations
Committee. for operation
beginning in the fall term.

According to SGB member
Patrick Abramowich, initial
funding for Telefact will be
provided throu the SGB reserve
fund. Costs for one year of
operation are estimated at
$42,000.

The service will provide’
information for the campus
community on a variety of

subjects. These include calls

relating to a personal crisis, first
aid or any emergency situation.

Also available will be data on
campus directions, activities,
administration or any general Pitt
information. Questions
concerning the city of Pittsburgh’s
social or cultural events, business
information or area directions will
also be handled by Telefact
personnel. ,

Abramowich said that questions
on other subjects may also be
answered by Telefact, depending
on the amount of time and
resources required by operators
to find the answer.

“T elefact offers students the
opportunity to personalize an
otherwise large and intimidating
university,” said Abramowich.

One key feature of Telefact is
that no one will be put on hold.
The system will be manned by

A Phone-in fact service coming in fall

student operators, who will be
paid $6 an hour. Located in the
William P_itt Union, Telefact is
tentatively scheduled to operate
from noon to 9 p.m. seven days
a week. Hours may be decreased
somewhat in the summer.

Abramowich and SGB
Presidentjulie Shepard have been
working on approval of the
project since October, when they
attended a student-leader “Think
T ank" session.

.“It was one of the things I
promised in my campaign
platform,” Abramowich said.
Although Telefact still needs
official approval from the SGB
members, Abramowich said that
should not be a problem since

the project has received board ‘

support throughout its research.

Recycling lauded as option to incineration

By Dominic Romeo
For The Pitt News

A group of concerned citizens

‘met at the William Pitt Union

with experts on solid waste
management to discuss why
Pittsburgh should recycle all of
its solid waste, some of which is
now being incinerated and
released into the atmosphere.

The Allegheny Group of the
Sierra Club and Concerned
Leaders for Environmental Action
Now of the University of
Pittsburgh sponsored a forum last
Wednesday to inform city officials
of alternatives to the current plan,
which involves both recycling
and incineration. The meeting
resulted from the Allegheny
County Sanitation Authority's
decision to install two new
incinerators as a part of a dual
alternative project to meet the
city’s increasing waste-removal
demands.

Sierra Club speaker Marilyn

S Skolnick said that the local chapter

  

STDET TECHNICL
  WRITING ASSISTANT

became interested in the situation
when it was learned that Alcosan
was planning to use the new
incinerators at their treatment
plant located along the Ohio
River.

“All environmental groups are
universally opposed to
[incineration] as being the primary
method of disposal,” said
Skolnick, who went on to say

i that most of the public is unaware

that there are alternatives to
incineration.

One alternative is the
conversion of sludge into a semi-
solid substance suitable for use
as a fertilizer. The Environmental
Protection Agency has endorsed
this type of “green” use for sludge,
and advocates incineration as a
last resort only, said Skolnick.
“Incineration has gone by the
wayside,” she said, “Recycling
makes a lot more sense.”

“There is a stigma associated
with the use of sludge,” said
Penn State University professor
Dale Baker, who holds a Ph.D. in

soil chemistry and plant
physiology from the University
of Missouri. Baker was on hand
to explain why Pennsylvania
sludge can be recycled into useful
and environmentally safe
products.

Baker is the developer of a soil
test that determines the level of
impurities in sludge in much the
same way that a pH test
determines acidity. He said that
with information from his test,
the chemical problems of any
soil can be corrected, including
the synthetic soil produced from
sludge. '

Baker told the group of citizens
that
synthetic soil made with sewage
slu dge is an environmentally safe
and mutually beneficial
alternative to incineration.

Not only is incineration energy
intensive, said Baker, but it is a
process that releases potentially
hazardous chemicals into the
atmosphere, contributing to the
acid rain problem and to local

cancer risks.

Bruce Brody, a chemical
engineer representing the Sierra
Club, gave the results of an

g Environmental Protection Agency
' report which clearly showed the

increased health risks associated
with incineration. The EPA has
concluded that incineration
pollution causes 60 times more
cancer cases per year than the
“green” use of sludge would
cause, said Brody.

Alcosan representative and
environmental engineer Carol
Howe spoke about the decision
to continue using incineration as
part of the “dual alternative”
program that is now being
implemented. Howe said that
the use of winter storage sites
that would be required for a
more aggressive recycling
program would not be “cost
effective."

Howe , also said that for
programs that turn sludge into
fertilizer they would ideally need

Editor’s Note.- To protect their
anonymity, the lastnama ofsome
people quoted in this article have
been omitted.

V On the corner of Oakland
Avenue and Sennott Street stands
a red brick house with grayish
trim. To most it is an ordinary
place, with a porch and yard
similar to others in the
neighborhood.

But to the daily “drop-ins,” at
People’s Oakland, the house at
231 Oakland Avenue is a special
getaway. A

“People need a place to go
when they are down and out. It’s
a nice place to come and make
friends," said Kevin, one of the
drop-ins at People’s Oakland.

People’s Oakland is a group

. that began in 1971 as’ a voice of

the Oakland community.
Residents were alarmed by
crime, parking problems and the
effects of institutional expansion
on the neighborhood.
“People’s started as a
community-organizing agency
that was formed by Oakland

residents,” said Maureen Cook,

executive director of People '3 for
the past 11 years. “We worked
with the institutions on zoning
plans, crime—prevention
programs, the decrease of liquor
licenses and issued parking

stickers.”

However, what began as a
community—planning and
organizing agency became a

mental-health project. In. 1973

and 1974, Woodville and Polk
State Hospitals released many
patients because of both the new
civil—rights law and the
introduction of drugs as a cure
for mental disorders.

As a result, many people came
out of the hospital with no
knowledge of or experience with
the outside world.

“Many of our people came out
of these hospitals with no
contacts,” Cook said. “For
example, at Polk most of them
were raised in the hospital from
chﬂdhood and had no
opportunities. They often had
little or no contact with their
families.”

“I was in Polk for 27 years, and
I came out with no place to go,”
said Robert, who has been a
regular drop-in since the early
days. “I was on the streets. A
hobo. A hippie.”

Because many of these people
had never been exposed to life
outside a hospital, others tried to
take advantage of their naivete.
Abuse by landlords was a problem
common to all.

“Even though their mental
capabilities were different, their
problems were the same. We

A held meetings on Tuesday nights

where we discussed their rights

as members of the Oakland
community,” said Cook.

An interest in social functions
grew from the Tuesday evening
meetings. Various activities are
held, including picnics in
Schenley Park, daily activities that
are facilitated by volunteers, a
softball team and the Golden
Group.

According to Wilma Sirmons,
program supervisor for six years,
members are encouraged to
stimulate group discussions.

Donna, a People’s member who
leads the health—awareness and
consumer-issues meetings, said,
“I like to come and socialize. I
like the program, and I’d miss it
if it weren’t here.”

Last summer the softball team
joined a formal league, which
consists of four teams from
mental-health centers. Last year
People’s Oakland won the
championship. Displayed on a
mantel in the front office is a
team photo and trophy.

“We have a softball team at
People’s, and we won the
championship last year. We just
started our season with a
doubleheader. We won the first
game 22-4. Iwas pitching, and
[we] lost the second game 10-3,”
said Duryei, who spoke about his
team with great excitement and.
pride.

, The Golden Group is for grass-
roots members —— those who
have been with People’s for the

« Mentally ill find social fun at People's Oakland

last 12-15 years. The group, for
50- to 85~year-olds, is sponsored
by its members and receives
funding from People’s.

“We are a socialization group.
Some of our outings include visits
to the Three Rivers Arts Festival,
nationality rooms, the zoo, [the]
Aviary and Phipps Conservatory,”
said the group facilitator.

Although many of the original
people from the '70s still “drop
in,” most of the newer members
are suffering from schizophrenia.

Because People’s is funded by
the Allegheny County Mental
Health Rehabilitation Center, it is
a county-wide agency; formal
referrals come from throughout
the county. However, because
the project primarily serves the
Oakland area, most referrals are
from Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic and St. Francis Medical
Center.

People’s tries to _ help its
members in social, educational
and vocational areas. The center
is open Monday through Friday
during the day for those members
who want to stop by for friendly
conversation and company. It is
a place where members feel
accepted and comfortable.

_ “I like the program. There are
a lot of nice things to do. It’s
something to talk and think about.
It’s an easy way to make friends, ”
said Jeanne.

“I am comfortable here,” said
Kevin. “They try to help you

3

integrate into society. When I'm
here, I don’t have to worry about
what people think of me or if
they are staring at me.”
People’s tries to help its
members re—enter the work force
through a vocational program.
The program helps members face
the competitive environment that
is part of any job. Members are
then placed in outside jobs,
usually as part-time volunteers.
“I am a VISTA volunteer. It’s a
disability-awareness program that

goes to elementary schools and ,

teaches children about people
with disabilities,” said‘Kevin W.
“Wilma [Sermons] is the main
reason I got the job,” he added
with great appreciation.

Although the main focus of
People’s is to place members in
outside jobs, the Litter Crew is a
work program that was
established by People’s in order
to help some of their members
earn extra money. The , crew
consists of four men who sweep
the sidewalks on Forbes Avenue.

The
community contributes toward
the salaries of the Litter Crew.
However, the program is in the
red and’ in need of more
community support.

“The Catholic Diocese gave us
a grant, and we've had donations,
but we have no formalized
approach for contributions,” said
Cook;

Providing seven Apollo
computer work stations for the
PreSbyterian—University Hospital

Pittsburgh, the University of
Pittsburgh’s department of
anesthesiology has been awarded
an equipment grant in the excess
of $236,000.

Allowing anesthesiologists and
critical care medicine staff to have
all pertinent information at hand,
the computers will continuously
display, analyze and store patient
physiological information from
which heart rate, blood pressure,

oxygen Saturation, and
temperature can be derived.

“With existing technology, this
information could not be easily
stored for clinical and research
purposes,” said Lee Deneault,
M.S., research assistant in the
department and principal
investigator in the study. “If it
was not recorded in a written
form, then it would not be
available for future use.”

“This new system, however,

will allow us to Store data for

further analysis. If a trend is
suspected after a certain type of
procedure is done on a group of
patients, previously recorded
patient data could easily be
reviewed and analyzed. In
essence we've developed an _in-

patient care. This type of
productive research aids in the
development of better care
techniques and will ultimately
save lives,” said Denault.

What to do zfyour catfozlls oﬁ’ of the roof Oakland

-—A friend has fallen and she
can’t get up.

—A roommate is doubled over
on your dorm room floor,
squealing in agony, clutching her
stomach. ’

— Your cat has fallen out the
window and landed in a sewage
drain.

Would you know what to do?

If not, you're not alone,
according to Robert Kennedy,
chief of Pittsburgh’s Emergency
Medical Services, who claims that
many people unfortunately do
not know the fastest way to get
an ambulance on the scene.

“All too often we see cases
where a person just didn’t know
what to do,” Kennedy said. “They
didn’t know to call 9-1-1 and
dialed an administration number
instead. Or they called 9-1-1 and
hung up before the operator could

I get all the information. Or they

didn’t have their house number
posted, and the ambulance had
to drive up and down the street
looking for them

“Time is perhaps the most"

   

critical factor in a medical
emergency, and all of these
scenarios cost time.”

Kennedy suggests that each
person develop an emergency
plan. “True emergencies happen
so rarely, they don’t think about
it until it happens.”

One of the first steps in a crisis,
said Kennedy, is to call 9-1-1. The
operators at 9-1-1 are specially
trained to deal with emergencies,
so let them lead the conversation.

Kennedy, says not to worry if
the conversation takes too long,
since the operator can send
information to a dispatcher while
the caller is still on the line.

Do not hang up; let the operator
end the call, to make sure he or
she has all necessary information.

Another key is to have
somebody waiting for the
ambu1ance’s arrival, so that the
driver doesn’t miss your house.

Another important step toward
proper emergency procedure is
knowing when not to call, said
Kennedy.

The courts are protecting
our Constitutional rights 

This week the Supreme Court voted 5-4 against a federal law
prohibiting desecration of the American flag.
President Bush and members of Congress protested immediately

I and said they will push for a Constitutional amendment that would

outlaw ﬂag desecration. This proposed law would be a violation of
the First Amendment and would infringe upon Americans’ right to
free expression.

The United States ﬂag is the symbol of the freedoms granted to the
citizens of this country. Those patriots who lost their lives ﬁghting for
the United States were fighting for the very freedoms that the ﬂag is

supposed to embody. Depriving Americans of one of these freedoms .

is not a tribute or an honor to war veterans or war dead.

Flag burning is used as a form of protest against the government
by those U .S. citizens to whom justice has not been served. American
Indians, for example, have the Constitutional right to burn the ﬂag to
display their disgust, anger and frustration against a system that has
abused and disregarded their people. The ability to protest, to
publicly disagree with the decisions of our elected officials, is one of
the freedoms that makes our country, our Constitution and our ﬂag
worth respecting and defending. /

As Supreme Court Justice William Brennan noted, “Punishing
desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes the
emblem so revered, and worth revering.”

 or are they?

Two members of the rap group 2 Live Crew were arrested in Ft.
Lauderdale, Florida Sunday for singing “obscene” lyrics at an adults
only show.

A federal judge declared the band’s lyrics obscene last week

‘because he. said they advocate violence against women, appeal to
prurient interests and lack artistic merit. Two days after the judge’s
ruling, a Florida record dealer was also arrested for selling the 2 Live
Crew album “As Nasty As They Wanna Be.”

The determination that 2 Live Crew’s music is “obscene” was made
by one judge. Because of his decision, record dealer Charles Freeman

‘ and 2 Live Crew members Luther Campbell and Chris Wongwon were

arrested, and arrest warrants have been issued for members Mark
Ross and David Hobbs. With his decision this judge has established
a dangerous precedent for censorship of the arts.

In the 19605, comedian Lenny Bruce was incarcerated for simply
uttering the 10—letter euphemism for fellatio. While Bruce’s material
may have offended some, his manipulation of profanity and use of
it as a social statement is considered genius. But it got him a jail
sentence in the name of morality. 2 Live Crew’s lyrics express much
the same cynicism and disdain for the morality pressed upon America
by a closed— minded few in power.

The disapproval of one federal judge does not outweigh the
Constitutional rights of artists to express themselves freely. We can
only hope that the intelligent masses will rise up against this ruling
in an opposition coda to this truly indecent song.

Crew: as risky as they Wanna be

Here we go again..-

On Monday in the handgun
capital of the United States, Flor-
ida, members of the rap group 2
Live Crew were arrested on ob-
scenity charges.

A few weeks ago, I mentioned
the band in a column I wrote
about certain hyper—patriots ral-
lying around the ﬂag. Since then,
a Broward County judge ruled in
a federal district court, that the
lyrics to the group's album “As
Nasty as They Wanna Be”, were
obscene.

On Friday, in Fort Lauderdale,
Nick Navarro, deputy sheriff,
raided a record store, and ar-
rested the owner, Charles Free-
man. This was after a spot check
of over forty record stores, by Mr.
Big and his minions ( I wonder
how many drug deals went down
during the time it took Deputy
Stalin, I mean Navarro, to harass
those forty record stores).

At approximately three a.m.
Monday morning, Sheriff
Navarro, and his thugs arrested
band members, Luther Campbell,
and Chris Wongwon on a misde-
meanor charge of violating a
prohibition against obscene per-
formances. The band had per-
formed a “clean version", (the
audience chanted the “nasty”
parts), of a song from the album
with “a suggestive title”, during
an adults only performance that
evening. Does anybody want to
speculate as to the number of
drug related murders that oc-
curred while Broward’s finest
were videotaping the show?

But Cowboy Hitler, disregarded
such petty issues in his quest to
rid society of the more immedi-
ate dangers. Yes, the good people
of Hollywood, Florida must be
protected against the seven deadly
words, even if these adults paid
to hear them. I can see him now,
his white ten gallon hat tipped
back, hand on his holster, and his
narrow eyes staring far off, envi-
sioning a time when he could
have had the offenders hung by
dawn — send out a posse! But
times have changed, this is a
different world... or is it?

Despite gains in social and
economic status, women, gays
and minorities are still enslaved
to the straight white male stan-
dards of sexuality. _,

Consider this. In New York, a
club has been harassed by au-
thorities concerned about a per-
formance by an ex-porn queen,
Annie Sprinkle. Parts of the
show satirized the sex industry.
For example, Ms. Sprinkle held
her bare breasts and bounced
them, ballet style, to classical
music, mocking the “big tits”
mentality of the porn trade.
Authorities said that her work is
obscene, yet the act was too
ridiculous to appeal to “prurient
interest”.

Lisa
Oshop

As a porn queen, though, Ms.
Sprinkle had performed live sex
acts on stage in the very same
club, and she was never both-
ered by police. Sprinkle con-
cluded that nude performances
done for the gratification of men
are less obscene than nude per-
formances parodying ‘it.

Art that depicts homo—erotic
acts are what spurred the Jesse
Helms flak. Dave Wojnariewicz,
a photographer, is suing Donald
Wildmon, from the American
Family Association. The Rever-
end Chinless Wonder cut, mini-
mized, enlarged, and made
“obscene” excerpts from the art-
ist's photo collage. Rev. Wildmon,
sent the result, showing graphic
details of men having sex with
each other, to members of the
Senate, Congress and concerned
citizens. Unfortunately,
Wildmon's desecration and dis-
tortion of evidence worked.

Senator Helms showed Wojnar-
iewicz’s “work” to Congress, to
support his case for the Helms
Amendment. Incidentally, Helms

requested that all women and
pages leave while he showed
these “photos” to Congress. I
guess he was trying to protect
women’s sensitive eyes, and the
pages’ virgin ears.

His message, though, was that
sex was for the “big boys”. Don’t
worry your pretty ‘lil head, we
tough strong men will take care
of everything.

These swaggering chumps are
taking care of it in Florida, too.
Despite the fact that not‘ one
citizen complained, Deputy
Navarro and Judge Rodriguez,
decided that the average mem-
ber of the community would be
offended if they heard 2 Live
Crew’s album. N avarro’s reasons
for “Nasty as they Wanna Be”
banishment are that the album
“advocates violence towards
women”, lacks artistic merit, and
that it appeals to “prurient inter-
ests”. It can be argued that Hus-

tler, Penthouse, Screw, and Guns ‘5’

‘N’ Roses each meet one or more
of these standards for obscenity,
but so far there has not been a
peep from Rodriguez and Navarro
about complaints by women, gay
and minority groups against the
material that these groups put
out.. What is it that makes

Gun’s and Roses’ material music .-

and 2 Live Crew’s pornography?
My guess would be that there are
certain unwritten yet understood
standards that make distinct the
nebulous line between what I
will call “acceptable” and “unac-
ceptable” porn. The standards
for “acceptable” porn are that
women must be objectiﬁed, ren-
dering " them submissive, that
gender roles must be intact un-
less it is for the gratification of the
male audience, and that under
no circumstances should “accept-
able” pom reflect any kind of
reality except the white straight
male’s.

Sprinkle violated these stan-
dards when she got up on stage
to demonstrate her own thoughts
of sexuality, moreover she chal-

lenged the status quo by satiri7.— ’

‘Craig cruising needs solution

There's been a lot of talk in
and around Oakland lately. Some
of the residents there are fed up
with the noise created by gay
men cruising the area late at
night. So fed up, that they went

'5‘ to the City Council last week to

ask them to stop the cruising,
preferably by closing off the
streets in the cruising circle to
traffic between the hours of 11
p.m. and S a.m.

The council, in the words of
Bentley Rand, one of the plain-

‘ tiffs, “basically just told us to go
home."

No wonder. .

Within one block of the Atrium,
the high—priced condominiums
where a good number of the
complaints are coming from, are
four restaurants, several shops
and three bars: the Holiday, Great
Scot and the Panther Hollow
Inn. The plaintiffs say that they
expected their “residential area”
to be free of excessive noise. An
area that is close to so many
businesses can hardly be termed
as strictly residential. What did
residents of this area expect when
they moved in, seclusion and
silence at night? Did they look at
the block right next to them
before they came in?

Furthermore, gay cruising has
been going on in the Craig Street
area since the 1950s, according
to Rick Austil of Cry Out!, a gay-
rights activist group. Surely resi-
dents might have considered this
before putting money and time

into a place where the noise is
“unbearable.”

Putting aside what the resi-
dents should or shouldn't have
expected when they decided to
move into a place smack be-
tween two major universities,
trying to solve the problem by
requesting that that the streets be
closed to non-residents during
the prime cruising hours is an
infringement on everyone’s rights.

Jennifer
Calabrese

It would mean telling the public
that the streets that their tax dollars
pay to maintain would be closed
off to them. If the residents want
their streets closed, then those
roads should be made private,
with the upkeep paid by the
streets’ residents.

No one can be sure how much
of a “gay issue” this is (i.e., are all
the complaints just because the
cruisers are gay?), but there does
seem to be a double standard.
Residents of Bouquet Street on
the south side of Forbes Avenue
haven't proposed closing their
street off just because of the high
traffic and noise level on their
streets that may be due to the
many businesses that are nearby,
so why should the residents of

the Craig Street area? Granted,
the two places are very different,
with the South Oakland Bouquet
Street being mainly student hous-
ing, but special intervention
should not be given because of
the high price that someone might
have paid to live in the Atrium.
Just as students accept that their
neighborhood might be a little
noisy because of the surround-
ings, the Craig Street residents
should also.

While the situation remains
unpleasant, it is unresolvable
without compromise from both
sides. The plaintiffs’ solution is
extreme and unfair, but likewise
some steps should be taken by
the cruisers to curb the noise.
The high level of noise is a result
of the high amount of cruisers,
many of whom are teenagers

A who have just discovered their

sexual orientation and have no
other place to go to socialize.

If the plaintiffs succeed in
convincing the city to close the
streets off, the problem will
remain. The cruisers will ﬁnd
somewhere else to ride around.
The people in the Oakland
community should spend their
energies trying to help the prob-

lem by establishing a place where ‘

gay teenagers can go, like a
community center, instead of
wasting time with unrealistic
solutions.

Get your facts straight, Luksik

“A fool always finds a greater
fool to admire him [or her].”

I once cracked open a fortune
cookie to read these words of
wisdom. I realized the truth
behind this message while await-
ing the Pennsylvania Republican
gubernatorial primary results. Peg
Luksik captured roughly 46 per-
cent. After a near cardiac arrest, I
asked myself, “Are Pennsylvania
Republicans brain dead for al-
most nominating pompous prud-
ish Peg, perhaps the most un-
qualified candidate for the gover-
nor’s office in recent history?”

With a Republican turnout of
less than 25 percent, voter apathy
almost permitted Luksik to win
the primary. Aren’t people aware
of Peg Luksik’s agenda and the

I babblings of her cohorts?

People Concerned for the
Unborn Child (PCUC), anti-abor-
tion-rights lunatics, labeled Luksik
“a principled choice.” According
to PCUC’s May andjune newslet-
ter, PCUC has “worked closely
with Peg Luksik in the pro-life
movement for many years.” PCUC
and Luksik’s Pennsylvania Par-
ents’ Commission oppose repro-

A ductive choice as well as sex
. education. These people support

ignorance, especially their own.

Here’s a good example of their
stupidity: Despite their interest in
sex, I think PCUC’s Cecile Hecker
could use a course on the human

' reproductive system. In June's

Exprmsion, a ‘newspaper’ that

defies description, Cecile wrote,
“[Planned Parenthood and sup-
porters of birth control] "consider
programming teens to become
homosexual a form of ‘birth
control.’ After all, homosexuals
don’t usually become pregnant. ”

Mark
Smith

I never heard homosexuality
listed as a form of birth control.

Equally absurd: On March 7,
1990, Pat Robertson, 1988 Re-
publican presidential candidate,
stated on the 700 Club: “Well, we
wonder why .we’re having so
many pregnancies today? One
million teenage girls pregnant
out of wedlock, half a million
abortions  why do you think
they're doing all of this? Because
the leaders, their leaders are
teaching them how to be homo-
sexuals, teaching them how to
be lesbians. ...” I’d'like to know
how two men or two women

having sex sometimes can be-

come pregnant?

I got lucky; I videotaped Pat’s
“impressive” knowledge of sexu-
ality as a reminder of his wis-
dom. Peg almost took Pennsyl-
vania, but Pat won the Republi-
can primary in Iowa. Republi-

cans must question thiselement
in their party!

Imagine going to the drug store
and learning that the birth-con-
trol pill was outlawed. Anti-abor-
tion-rights groups support crimi-
nalizing the pill, which prevents
conception, and the I.U.D., which
prevents implantation of a fertil-
ized egg. RU-486, the hormonal
abortion pill, is also being used to
treat breast cancer in France, but
anti-abortion groups oppose
bringing RU-486 to the states. So
far, no effort is being made to
bring this potential medical break-
through here because Pat, Peg
and the crew get their way.

Things you must do to stop
the blind leading the blind:

1. Pray for brains. God knows
Pat, Peg and Cecile could use
some.

2. Read. Reading challenges
the assumptions and prejudices
that Peg, Pat and the gang use to
prop up their ravings.

3. Cut this article out and send
it to Governor Casey, Senator
Heinz or Senator Specter. Tell
them you are fed up with Pat
Robertson, PCUC and the whole
lot. .

I know many people only shrug
their shoulders and claim noth-
ing can be done. But you have to

‘ do something, or you would be .

an even greater fool for allowing
the blind to control your life.

There are two sides
to tbe co-ed com

This letter is regarding Uennifer Calabrese’sl article “No Men
Allowed  Women ﬁnd support and unity at all-female
colleges."

I am not writing this letter in order to question your views on
all-female colleges [...] but rather, I would ask you to consider
the other end of the spectrum — the Virginia Military Institute.

The Virginia Military Institute [of] Lexington, Virginia, has
been brought up on charges of sex discrimination. VMI, a
military school — an all-male military institution!

This well-established institution is founded in making the
citizen-soldier and much tradition. But the deep-rooted tradi-
tion is being challenged by the state and federal court systems _
as. to whether or not women will be admitted to VMI [...]

[Tlhe cadets themselves and alumni are familiar with endur- '
ing the “rat line" (the first year of a cadet) and truly appreciat-

ing the vast history and
honor code _ of a cadet
and gentle- man; there is
tradition  within both
the inStitu- tion and the
VMI com- munity. This
tr a d i ti o n

should not
be tampered with. [...] ‘

There are only two military schools that are all-male after all
of the military academies have gone coed. They are VMI and
the Citadel. These schools are dedicated to excellence and
producing a unique male-bonding experience that might not
otherwise be obtained [in] a co-ed environment. With the
admittance of women to an all-male institution, there lies an
awkwardness between both mental and physical competition.
[...]

Mills College and Wellesleygcollege received vast attention
from the media; VMI has received far less. [...] What makes the
Mills and Wellesley situations any more important than VMI’s?-
There isno difference between the two. [...]

Yes, ﬁnancial obstacles pose a major problem for these all-
”whatever” institutions. But why should this be a major
hindrance in pursuing the type of education and environment
that an individual seeks? '

male sexuality

Wojnariewicz violated these standards by both bending the roles
concerning gender and reﬂecting a reality alien from the straight
white male’s.

Despite displays of hyper—masculine sexuality that raise a few
eyebrows, black artists like Ton Loc and Eddie Murphy really do not
violate the standards for “acceptable”‘white male obscenity. The
crotch grabbing image that both men present, are too exaggerated
to reﬂect any reality. Their characterization of women and sex reflect
common stereotypes of women as whores or as castrating bitches
who demand gratification.

2 Live Crew lives up to objectifying women, and gender roles.
What makes them so damnable that their music is not aimed at the
white male audience but rather confronts the African-American
community whom the band wants “to think and reﬂect” about their
language and attitudes. Keeping with conventional standards, Ton
Loc avoids being too real by calling sex the ‘wild thing". 2 Live Crew
rather than indulging in a semblance of illusion comes right out and
says “me so horny". ,

I sense a real sexist and racistbias on the part of the authorities who
are making decisions on what objectionable work is censored and
what objectionable work is allowed to remain. No where in the
recent political uproar calling for censorship are straight white men
attacked. Homogeneity in art and popular culture was the hallmark
of the eras in which women were burned at the stake, blacks were
enslaved, and gays as well as religious and ethnic minorities were
gassed. It is imperative that every concerned citizen screams in
outrage over censorship. If we do not speak up for ourselves our
speech will be decided for us.

World Music. Funny how any
sounds coming from any non-
anglo place get lumped under
the heading of World Music. The
truth is there are so many local
forms of pop music, let alone
traditional styles, in the world, it’s
as ridiculous to call them by the
same name as it is to introduce
Neneh Cherry and Clifton Chenier
as “American pop.”

But with the explosion of
international styles being
imported —— encouraged by
conscious-era popsters such as

Mahlathini and the Mahotella

jive. This is the type of music that
inspired Paul Simon to record his
Graceland LP a few years ago.
Mbaqanga is characterized by
brisk Afro-pop rhythms, intricate
guitar playing,
sweeping synthesizers or horns,
and call-and—response singing
between a charismatic leader and
an often-female chorus. V

PSYCHIC TV

By Tim Azinger

What more can be said about a
husband and wife musical team
with tattoos and pierced genitals,
except that they’re obviously into
something different?

For almost 15 years now,
Genesis P—Orridge has based his
life around doing something
different. Starting in 1975 as the
leader of the now legendary and
still popular Throbbing Gristle,
Genesis “invented” what is now
referred to as “industrial music.”
It was one of the most radical
explorations of music to date,
and it is credited with paving the
way for the punk trend that soon
followed.

Genesis retired Throbbing
Gristle in 1981 and soon after
married Paula. Psychic TV was
formed in 1983 when Genesis
and Paula joined forces with
ex-alternative-TV founder Alex

Fergusson. The band continued
its musical experimentation,
releasing numerous albums until
Fergusson eventually left the
group.

Psychic TV continued under
the leadership of Genesis and
began to release a series of 23
live albums, one each month. To
date, 16 have been released. Their
musical styles have oscillated from
rock to pop, and their most recent
projects with W ax Trax Records
have uncovered what has come
to be known as Acid House music.

The current P'IV lineup includes
Genesis and Paula along with
Matthew Best on drums, Fred
Giannelli on guitar and Daniel
Black on keyboards.

Henry Rollins first rose to power
as the frontman for the now-
defunct Black Flag. Hank, as fans
and friends often refer to himp
put the punch behind this unruly
power—punk group. His screams
incited riots, and his answer to an
obnoxious fan was a kick in the
head. Physicality was the ultimate
expression.

Since his punk rock days, Hank
has admittedly and drastically
matured and tapped the
intellectual
aggressive psyche. While often
revered for being outspoken,
Rollins refers to it as “being
realistic,” and believes that all the
problems in the world are created
out of weakness and denial of
reality.

Rollins currently directs his
creative efforts as an author,
lecturer and singer/founder or 
the Rollins Band. Somehow he
manages to juggle his energies
among the three.

The Rollins Band has just
finished a tour of Australia in
support of their third album,
Hard, and Hank’s jumping right
into a series of Spoken Word
tours, which are more or less}:
Henry Rollins’ reﬂections on the

48 Hours just another typical lame sequel

By Matthew Myers
Stqﬁ’ wruer

One of the first of this summer’s
plethora of sequels, Another 48
Hours, is proof positive that any
script, no matter how badly the
holes show, can be made to
capitalize on Hollywood's
formulaic production pattern. By
now, however, every moviegoer
in the world should expect the
unexpected, or rather, should
anticipate the triteness we are
forced to endure.

‘Besides, what can these movies
tell us that we don't already know?
What more do they have to offer
besides a larger body count and
bigger visual effects? Not a damn
thing.

If this sequel to 1982’s 48 Hours

and I still think I was cheated.
Bottom line: Jack Cates (played
by Nick Nolte) is under
investigation by the district
attorney’s office for the death of
a criminal. Hot on the trail of a
mysterious crime lord known as
the Iceman, Cates is suspended
from the force and faced with a
prison sentence unless he clears
his name. His only clue to the
Iceman’s identity is Reggie
Hammond (played by Eddie
Murphy), who is being hunted by
the Iceman’s hired easy ridin’
bounty hunters. Following his
release from prison, Hammond
and Cates team up again to solve

the mystery. They have only 48
hours to clear Jack's name, but
just two hours of this nonsense is
enough to drive any audience
insane.

First of all, this movie is not
funny. Those Eddie Murphy fans
expecting to see that wise—ass
grin and that donkey laugh will
undoubtedly be disappointed in
Paramount Pictures’ big boy. In
all, he has about three‘ genuinely
funny moments, but the rest are
played so hard that the effort
shows through.

For instance, in the original
1982 smash Murphy was seen
screaming the lyrics of some
Marvin Gaye or Stevie Wonder
song, tuned out from the world
(in true ‘80s fashion) on his
Walkman. In the sequel, the

filmmakers think this is so funny
that they have to show it to us for
10 minutes. It’s not that funny
anymore.

And instead of a humorous
entrance, Murphy is deadpan
serious. He doesn’t make usl
laugh until about halfway intol
the movie, and then, it’s at the
expense of Nolte. Big deal. The
original film was a fresh and
innovative venture for
Hollywood, at true alteration in

back then, this was real

producers pulled it off. And back
then, Murphy was given second
billing to Nolte.

Festival. In African countries they
have their own pop radio and
aspiring stars and, like in the
southern United States with
Zydeco, regional hit records. But
when bands take the stage in
Africa, it means something
different from when Bon Jovi
collects on a sold-out stadium or
when Bo Diddley travels the tired
festival circuit. Bands in Africa
practice 30—plus hours a week
and play all night on the
weekends. And Mahlathini’s
group, Makgona Tsohle (“The
Band That Knows Everything”)
has been together since 1965.

Third—world music fills a social
function, something more urgent
than the high-turnover,
narcoticized pop in this country.
African pop is often politically
colored party music like Fela Kuti
or Thomas Mapfumo. In the case
of Mahlathini, the music is pure,
joyful dance pop, something that
probably does well in South
Africa.

They're bringing a completely
different musical ethic to

Pittsburgh today. Their concert
should be a rare challenging and
worth while experience.

What price to pay?

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Come fall term, Pitt students will be able to use the new Charles L.
Cost Center located behind Trees Hall for a variety of activities. It may
come with a price, literally.

The university has not yet determined if students will be required
to pay an entry fee to use the facilities. ,

The complex will house an area the size of a regulation football
field which can be converted to nine tennis courts in an hour and a
half as its main attraction. According to Pitt’s director of athletics, Ed
Bozik, most of the sports teams, including football, baseball, soccer
and track, will be able to practice in the new building.

Also, students will be able to use the building for physical-
education classes in case of inclement weather. Recreational tennis
and conditioning activities were also mentioned as viable uses of
interest to the general student populace.

“There hasn’t been any determination as to [charging-students to
use the Cost Center] yet. We are trying to ﬁgure out ways to cover the
operating costs of the building, especially with the university’s
financial structure the way it is," Bozik said.

According to Bozik, the original plan was to operate the center like
a tennis club, ‘thus charging admission to students.

“Most schools [with a comparable special facility] have a charge
associated with admission. Most do, but some don’t,” Bozik said.

Pitt’s associate director of athletics, Dean Billick, was unsure of the
ultimate outcome regarding entry fees.

“It lstudents’ paying] might be the way we have to go, but it’s not
the way that we want to go. Right now, I don’t expect that it will open
for student use until the fall term. Obviously we’ll have to make a
decision before that [in regard to student payingl,” Billick said.

An area of monetary interest that recently arose was a contribution
of $50,000 to the center which was supposed to be made by former
Pitt football coach Mike Gottfried. Gottfried has apparently not
donated the money yet, but Bozik is not concerned.

‘‘That’s something I can’t worry about now. Mike is no longer an
employee of the university, and I would be surprised if he fulfilled
his.original intent,” Bozik said.  ’ 0

“T o the best of my knowledge, I don’t believe we’ve received
lGottfried’sl donation, but I can’t be 100 percent sure of that,” Billick
said.

A good portion of the center has already been taken care of
ﬁnancially, but Pitt is not quite out of the woods yet in totally covering
its costs. According to Billick, a bond may have to be put out to raise
the rest of the funds, and that will be done through the athletic
department.

“If the students have to pay [to use the Cost Center], it will be for
operational reasons,” not to pay off the rest of the funding or other
reasons, Billick said.

Host of celebrities tee ojffor Autism Society

By Mike Rampa
sports Editor

June 11, 1990 — Montour
Heights Country Club. Sight of
the Ninth Annual Myron Cope/
Foge Fazio Golf Tournament for
Autistic Children. A beautiful,
sunny Monday with temperatures
in the mid-’70s and a light breeze
blowing that is just enough to
keep the yellow ﬂags on the
putting surfaces waving and
visible from the tee. A group of
six golfers stands on the first tee
and five of them quiet down as
one of the best hockey players in
the world leans over to tee up his
ball 

Mario Lemieux’s back problems
have been the subject of
conversations at barrooms, dinner
parties and company picnics since
the Penguin star was first
diagnosed with a herniated disk
way back during hockey season.
His doctors, trainers, teammates
literally
swamped with questions about
his injury, its seriousness, his
progress, etc. But on this day the
public can rest a little easier about
Lemieux and his health.

To play golf well, which
Lemieux’s 2 handicap will attest
to, one must be ﬂexible and
strong. The art of the golf swing

entire swing. Having strong arms
has little to do with how far one
hits the ball. It's all in the motion
of the body and how much power
it can muster up through coiling
its muscles. And the muscles in
the human back are extremely
important variables in
determining distance and
accuracy.

This tournament. being a
shotgun scramble, Lemieux
started his day on the 10th tee
through the luck of the draw.
Being a concerned journalist, this
reporter hurried to the tee to see
Lemieux’s first shot of the day.
He went to his bag, pulled his
metal driver, looked over the
situation, and sent the ball on a
trajectory even NASA would have
been proud of.

With the help of another
colleague of mine, we measured
Mario’s tee shot at just over 300
yards, to the right side of the
fairway. Don't worry, Pittsburgh,
old number 66 looks like he
hasn’t missed a beat.

Asked if he was considering
joining the PGA tour, Lemieux
did not rule the possibility out.
“I’m not thinking about it right
now, I'm just playing for fun, and
I'm making a living playing

-' hockey and that’s what I want to

do right now,” Lemieux said.

Lemieux was in the winning
group for the past two years, but
did not ﬁnish in the Top 5 on
Monday. Steeler Chuck Lanza and
Toronto Maple Leaf Dave Hannan
took the top two spots this year.

Myron Cape and Foge Fazio
have held this tournament for the
past nine years to beneﬁt the
Pittsburgh Autism Society. Many
local celebrities take time out of
their schedules and donate their
finances (there is a $200 entry
fee) for this increasingly
successful golf outing which
brings sports personalities ranging
from scratch to inﬁnity on the
handicap board.

“This tournament is a big part
of the Autism Society’s budget.
It’s a very hard working and
worthwhile charity that does not
have a big professional staff or
fund raisers. I’m their fund raiser
to a large extent, and the whole
purpose of this is to net every
penny of this tournament to the
Autism Society," Cope said.

difﬁcult task.

“It takes a lot of people willing
to do a lot of work for no monetary
rewards. You need a lot of people
willing to make phone calls, send
letters and be enthused about
raising money for a charity made
up mostly of volunteers,” Cope
said.

Cope was the sports editor of

Tbe Pitt News back in 1959. Most
of today’s college generation
knows Cope as a broadcaster,
but Cope was also an excellent
writer. “My ambition was to be a
newspaper guy and I was in that
for about nine or 10 years and
then I went into magazine writing
and by accident into broadcasting.
I would have been happy to be a
newspaper guy the rest of my
life.”

For Fazio, the tournament is a
homecoming of sorts. “It’s great
to be back. This is my home club
and everyone is an old time friend,
and I’ll get some time to spend
with my mom in Coraopolis. It's
good to see all the other coaches
and the Pitt and Steeler players
again,” Fazio said.

Fazio is relieved of his duties
with the New York Jets until July
10 at which time he will return to
New York to get ready for camp

on July 22.

Steeler Tom Ricketts was out in
full force with his new set of
clubs after coming off what he
called a “pretty good mini—camp.”

“My feet feel good. I got those
banged up pretty good last year
and broke my thumb — there
were a lot of little things. But it
was a year for getting some
experience and learning what to
expect, and I think I’m ahead of
the game right now,” Ricketts
said.

Ricketts is working at both right
and left guard presently and did
not see the tackle position at all
during the Steelers mini-camp; a
position which was his forte
during his years at Pitt.

“I think learning the guard
position has given me a better
knowledge of the game what the
whole line is doing,” he said.

Ricketts will be busy enough
off the ﬁeld, as he is getting
married on June 30 and is in the
process of getting his new house

. Pittsburgh to host first showjumping competition

By Doug Miller
For The Pitt News

 

For the first time ever, Pittsburgh will host a horse showjumping competition. Yesterday at the
Allegheny Club in Three Rivers Stadium, former Pittsburgh Steelers’ star Lynn Swann announced that the  7   . , , _ 
Hartwood Showjumping Festival will take place June 26 through July 1 at Hartwood Acres. ‘

   
   
         
   
      

 

 
   
   
     
   
   
   
     
  
   

 
         
   
   
   
   
   
      

  

    

E The Festival will beneﬁt the Parental Stress Center, an independent, non-profit social—service agency
that provides a variety of services for the area's abused, neglected and high-risk children and their families.
Bob Bernardini, first vice president of the PSC, is hoping the event will increase Pittsburgh's awareness
not only of world-class horsejumping, but also the need for greater awareness of child-abuse problems.
“We would like to raise money for the center, and every year it becomes harder and harder," Bernardini
said. “Our expectations for the Festival are high, and we hope this will be a big money—maker."
Showjumping is divided into three main divisions: the Jumper division, the Hunter division and the
Equitation division. The Jumper division is broken down into eight sections, ranging from Schooling
Jumper (open to all horses) to Children's/AdultJumper (more experienced amateur riders). The Hunter
division is the largest of the three, containing 17 different forums in which riders may compete. The richest
, and most grand of all showjumping competitions is the Equitation division, where horse and rider will
compete in the Festival’s Grand Prix for a first-place prize of $9,000.
Participants in the Grand Prix are some of the world’s top riders. Events are held weekly in major cities
around the world.
Lynn Swann commented on the Pittsburgh stop of the showjumping tour, “We want to see Pittsburgh
continue to grow as one of the world’s most livable cities, and this opportunity provides people with an
excellent chance of seeing world class competitors, as well as providing for a great cause.”
Many former and future Olympians will be on hand, as well as Pittsburgh’s only Grand Prix rider, Chuck -
Waters. He spoke of the opportunity of perhaps winning his first blue ribbon, saying, “It would really   --  it   _  _ 
be a big kick to jump up and win this thing! That would be a great buzz.” I h 6 al_ 26_ L
There will be an exhibition at Point State Park on Monday, June 25. The Festival will provide an The H g _ 00d S owiumping Fes V June July
opportunity for spectators to witness the beauty and grace of one of the world’s most prized animals. r 1

U.S. soccer team on road to fulfilling bad expectations

By Sean Heilman
Sta_ﬁ" W1-iter

The U.S. World Cup team was

.looking forward to this past
‘Sunday since it qualified for

soccer’s world-championship
tournament last November. Its 5-
1 thrashing at the hands of a
mediocre, at best,
Czechoslovakian squad has made
for a distinct probability of a long
two games before it is sent back
home in humiliation.

The U.S. still must play
tournament-favorite Italy in front
of 80,000 crazies in _ Rome’s
Olympic Stadium on Thursday (3
p.m., TNT network) and an
Austrian squad that lost to the
Italians 1-0. And many people
feel the Austrian squad is

considerably better than the

Czechs.

A strong defense was expected
to carry the United States to soccer
respectability during this World
Cup. Instead it has disappointed,
leaving it hard pressed to justify
its presence in Italy.

The Americans mounted few
legitimate offensive attacks. They
looked like they were playing
with a load of bricks tied to their
ankles, often being beaten to
loose balls when they had a step
advantage on their opponent. The
defense was embarrassed time
and again. It even allowed the
shortest Czech player on the ﬁeld
to leap and head a corner kick
pass directly into the U.S. goal.

Their play was ample
reinforcement of the world-soccer

media's predictions that the

United States would not come

close to winning or tying any
games. They did score a goal,
however, which in itself was a
surprise to the rest of the world.
Paul Caligiuri scored midway

through the second half to cut the
score to 3-1.
“The U.S. has been a

disappointment,” said Pitt head
soccer coachjoe Luxbacher. “The
guys were trying too hard. They
got out of their typicalstyle and
were reckless [offensively]. They
were getting caught with three-
on-twos and four-on-threes
[against theml.”

Their play against the Czechs
has caused Italian journalists to
anticipate the possibility of World
Cup scoring records to be broken
Thursday when the United States
faces Italy. The most lopsided
World Cup score in history is 10-

1.

“The Czechs played well in the
qualifying round, but they lost
their last four exhibition games,”
Luxbacher said. “The rumors were
that they were in dissent.”

But the Czechs looked like

they were a team -prepared to

challenge for the World Cup
trophy. The U. S. team made them
look that good.

“I don't think the U.S. is as bad
as it looked. They were letting
people run free and were over-
attacking. Against Italy they will
be a huge underdog. The U.S.
team is young, but it isn't over
yet. They went [to Italy] to show
that they can play. But if they get
blown away [in the last two
games].  “

Adding to the pressure the U.S.
team has this Thursday; it not

only must play an Italian squad
considered the best in the world,
but they are playing in Italy. The
Italians have surprised many with
their offensive play in their first
game. Italy failed to finish
numerous scoring chances against

Austria and could have won 3-0 p

or 4-0.

“What astounded me was the
play of the Italians. They created
chances,” Luxbacher said. “They
are known for a strong defense.
When you create chances, you
are going to score some goals.
Italy could be the best team in the
tournament. The U.S. better strap
up their boots.

“Italy and Brazil have been
excellent (Brazil defeated a
stubborn Swedish team, 2-1). I
would say Italy looked best. Brazil
looked vulnerable in the back,”
Luxbacher added.

athletes are only juniors, thus
making the feat even more
memorable. Men’s and women's
sprint coach Steve Lewis said,
“That achievement is outstanding
considering their ages. Anytime
you have an athlete that places in
the Top 10 in the country, it’s a
real pleasure.

“I felt both were capable of
such accomplishments,” he
added.
