Reagan,
The Fourth
Stooge?  

By ANN WALKER.

“The Reagan Administration
seems to be doing the job of three
men: Moe, Larry and Curly," Pro-
fessor William Johnston of the polit-
ical science department said at
yesterday’s University Honors Pro-

_ gram's (UHP) Noontime Lecture.

The lecture focused on President
Reagan and looked ahead to 1984.
Johnston addressed three main
issues, including the adaptation of
an “aloof” administration to one of
“politics as usual,” the extent to
which the president will involve him-
self in his agenda and the question of

‘ whether or not he will run for re-

"with an unusual agenda," Johnston

said. “The public views Reagan as a
nine-to-ﬁve president, and his advis-

become more involved with his

According to Johnston, the presi-
dent may feel uncomfortable with
increased involvement because it
will cause changes in the way he pre-
‘sides over the office.

I the Social Security issue is advan-

tageous for Reagan because he is

portrayed as being bi-partisan.
“This issue is a mine ﬁeld because

McGeehee said he submitted his
findings to the agency, but after a
brief period of praise, he was told to
go back to Washington, D.C.

His ﬁndings, he said, ran counter
to the , official Washington view-

 

successfully scaring the North Viet-
namese into the South, the CIA used
this migration as propaganda,
according to McGeehee, to induce
. American support for the South
against the North.
Another example, he said, was the
Gulf of Tonkin incident. The CIA,

tries in the Third World,” he said.
“While proclaiming its good
intentions and decrying the threat to
its national security, U.S. policy
makers have imposed unpopular

governments and shored them up

with armies, police and weapons.”

Board e
Establishes
New ,
Corporation

By CHRISTITNA CLINTON

The Board of Trustees yesterday
approved the formation of a non-

profit corporation that will eventu- _

ally reap benefits for the university

and protect it from any liabilities.

connected with the activities of the
corporation.

The new corporation, the Univer- A

sity of Pittsburgh Trust, will enable
certain corporations affiliated with
the university to conduct activities
that are notaffiliated with teaching,
such as medical services and applie
research and development. ’

“This new trust will provide a vs;

.hicle for organizing activities that-

would benefit the university but can
most appropriately function as
separate entities,"’ said Pitt chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar. . “

Under the trust, Pitt would be
protected from any liabilities that
may occur from the corporations
activities which do not have educa-
tional purposes.

Posvar said the trust is,.an ideal
way to better managethe univeisi.-
ty’s subsidies and funds. In addition,

of the Title XI grants, which give
financial aid to students pursuing
careers in the ﬁeld of international
affairs.

“Ina country that cares about
national security, to eliminate for-

-eign knowledge in the next genera-

tion is ridiculous.” he said.

is a liberal arts education, which is
offered at Pitt through the College of
Arts and Sciences, a valuable one?
‘- This question was posed to var-
ious members of the Pitt commun-
ity for this week's “Forum."

Barry Applbaum

Coor ina or of honors
advis ng in the Univer-
sity Honors Program

A liberal arts education is “very
valuable," according to Applbaum.
“If students are not sure of what they
want, either personally or academi-
cally, a liberal arts education pro-
vides a ﬂexible, good background in
a variety of disciplines."

However, Applbaum does see a

I drawback.

"The problem with a liberal arts
education is it places a large burden
on the student to plan his education
in a useful fashion. For example,
engineering is a well-deﬁned disci-

I ‘ pline in which an accepted body of

information is learned. But in the lib-
eral arts, to an extremely large extent,
the students deﬁne their own educa-

tion by choosing courses which
meet their own particular needs."

The main weakness of the liberal
arts program is also one of its main
strengthes, Applbaum said. “Done
right, you can tailor-make an educa-
tional program that enables you to
pursue your own goals."

A liberal arts education also offers
a student the chance to do more
than just land a job; he can develop a
career. To Applbaum, a career is
"something bigger than just paying
the bills." A career also gives per-
sonal satisfaction and aids personal
development.

"By the very nature of the liberal
arts program, you can go to school
for four years, graduate and have
nothing—if you take the easy way
out. But if you map out properly and
assess your goals and desires you
can set up a liberal arts program con-
gruent to your aptitudes and goals.
Then you can pursue a career or get
a job. It just takes planning."

through the liberal arts that we under-
stand the intellectual and cultural tra-
ditions that make us what we are and
provide the basis for what we can be
as people."

Although Haugeland does not feel
that every student should major in a
liberal arts related area, he does feel
that all areas should include a strong
liberal arts component.

"A liberal arts education shouldn't
be scaled down to a token. This des-
troys the purpose of educating the
whole person. if that person is edu-

' cated in other things as well, that's all

right

To Beckman, the value of a liberal
arts education depends on the indi-
vidual. “For people who only want to
ﬁnd a job and make money, a techni-
cal education would suffice. But for
people with any interest beyond that
technical ﬁeld, it's not enough."

Because she feels that an exclu-
sively technical education is too
“one-tracked," Beckman is in favor
of extending the time required to
graduate with a technical degree
from four to ﬁve years so that stu-

dents can take -more upper-level.
courses in other areas of interest.

An electrical engineer for two
years, Beckman switched to a dual
major of computer science and writ-
ing because she became "bored and
unrestful" with ﬁve technical classes
per term.

"I think an education is more
worthwhile and enjoyable if there's a
diversity of work rather than if all the
courses demand the same kind of
thought. -

“lf technical students don't care
about their overall education, then
they might as well go to Triangle
Tech. There they can learn to punch

security and money, but there are
just as many with other interests who
are grinding their teeth. Some over-
load with 20 credits per term to
pursue outside interests." '

Susan Harland ‘
Academic adviser to bus-
iness majors and English
majors .

"In business, there are two choi-
ces. One, strict vocational training,

tends to yield job offers but not a lot
of chances for advancement. If they
take liberal arts courses, there are
fewer job offers at the outset, but
liberal arts majors climb the corpo
rate ladder more frequently and
quickly and have a higher rate of job
satisfaction. As Socrates said,‘The
unexamined life is not worth living,’ "
Harland said.

-Harland sees several advantages
of a liberal arts ‘education over a
strictly technical one.

"The way a liberal arts education is
supposed to work is thatit teaches
students how to learn, think and ana-
lyze. it's not just learning a set of
specialized skills, but rather a set of
procedures to apply to other skills.

"The specialized, vocationally
trained person is stuck with what
skills he has. A we|der‘can do one
thing, weld. A liberal arts graduate
isn't that limited in career choices, so

perhaps he'll ﬂounder around until i

he ﬁnds one he can live with."

Harland also gave one more rea-
son, why students choose a liberal
arts education. "A liberal arts degree
usually produces a more content
person. If you can't have what you
like, you can at least like what you
nave."

  Scare Tactics

Morality inevitably creeps into the law.

_ Murder and rape, for example, are violations of

both moral and legal standards. But this does not
mean that “morality” and “law” are interchange-
able titles for the same set of rules.

Drawing the line between morality and law is,
admittedly, a rough task, although most people
can agree on some guidelines. Moral rules have in
common some statement of what is intrinsically
good—or bad—for people. The purpose of laws,
on the other hand, is to create a framework in
which people—who are often selfish—can live
together and benefit from society. Fortunately, a
federal judge has at last shown a willingness to-

‘ understand and respect this important distinction

in an area where the Reagan administration has

failed.

In a Manhattan court recently, Judge Henry
Werker called for the blocking of enforcement of
the Reagan administration’s “squeal rule,” which
requires family planning clinics to notify teen-
agers’ parents before providing them with repro-
ductive counseling or contraceptives. .

Opponents of Judge Werker’s move might
attack that decision from two directions, but both
arguments widely miss the point of the crucial
difference between law and morality. First, the
administration has argued that the “squeal rule”
will encourage “family participation” in an
attempt to alleviate what Congress has called the
“critical” problem of teen-age pregnancy.

But if the intent of the law or of lawmakers is
actually to address that problem, isn’t it equally

(or perhaps more) probable that the “squeal rule“
would scare away significant numbers of young
men and women who could benefit from advice
or instruction in preventing conception? If that
"probability becomes a reality——.and it almost cer-
tainly would—then the “squeal rule” would actu-
ally hurt the valid intent of our lawmakers to stem

the tide of teen-age pregnancy.

A second argument might claim that either
teen-age sexual promiscuity or contraception or ’

both, are immoral and that the

law should pro-

vide no encouragement for immoral behavior.
This argument clearly ignores the overwhelming
evidence that—-immoral or not—teen-agers will
continue to be sexually active and that without
access to family planning advice, society will pay
the price in terms of an increase in unwanted

births.

While morality may be rightly concerned with

promiscuity, the law must be

concerned with

society. Thanks are due to Judge Werker for

. making this point clear.

Letters To The Editor

Sticking To The Realilssues

Dear Editor: I

As an official in a progressive po-
litical party, it bothers me that the
local left has such a distorted view of
Israel. There are things wrong with
Israel; the church-state separation

_ there should be stricter, the military

under closer civilian control, and it
would be best to vote out the Begin

administration altogether. But it is ,

hardly the’ fascist superstate por-
trayed in recent letters, especially the
one last Wednesday. Some specific
points:

0 Israel does not have “the third
stongest army in the world after the
United States and the USSR.” this
dubious honor belongs to the Peo-
ples’. Republic of China. There are
dozens of nations ahead of Israel in
manpower, weaponry and funding.
It even has a smaller armed forces
(l64,000 regulars and 236,000 reser-
vists) than do many of its hostile
neighbors (227,500 for Syria, for
instance. and 188.000, for Iraq). '

0 Israel does not want Arab land,
or it wouldn’t have given up the (oil-
rich) Sinai. Somefanatics there do
want Arab land. Some fanatics here
want the Panama Canal. Does that
mean the U.S. wants Latin Ameri-
can land?’

0 The letter-writer Wednesday
states that “the massacre in Lebanon
was not Israel’s first holocaust
against Arab women and children.
Children as young as 11 have been
killed on the West Bank for...ex-
pressing their views.” First, the
-Israeli army didn’t cause the massa-

_cre, but failed to stop\Ait—which is

; just as bad but not the same thing.

‘Secondly, the death of an 11-year-
old occurred when Israeli troops
fired into a rioting crowd—not the
brightest thing in the world to do but
not the political assassination
implied by the letter-writer. Child-
ren are executed for political reasons
in certain- Arab countries; ,not in
Israel.

Some shorter responses:

0,Amnesty International does not
cite any political prisoners in Israel
at the moment, although it has in the
past (as it did for the U.S.—

' remember the Wilmington Ten?).

“Collective punishment" is not
Israeli policy. The Iraqi reactor was
refining nuclear bomb material.
This litany of responses should
not be taken to mean that I approve
a permanent Israeli presence on the
West Bank; Idon’t. It doesn’t_ meanql

~32.-. --

,-,_>:_|_. I.‘ _

Arab nations are evil; I ’don’t. But
the opposite proposal—that Israel
has caused all the problems in the
Middle East and the Arabs are inno-
cent victims of capitalist imperialist
fascist Zionism, fascist Zionist capi-
talist imperialism or whatever—is

just as silly. Let's try to stick to real
issues.

“Barton Levenson
,_ President,
Commonwealth Party

Amusing,Not Frightening

Dear Editor:

After reading pages 4 and 5 of the
Opinion Page for Feb. 11, 1983, I
can now believe that the same view

.can be in two places at the same

time. Both the lead editorial and
Scott Rex’s article (“Communists
and the Freeze Movement) reflect
profound misreadings of an impor-
tant issue that deserves much more
careful attention.

Both articles argue that it is a mis-
take for advocates and participants
in the nuclear freeze movement to
allow “Communist groups” to
become involved in this protest con-
tending that such involvement
“stands to possibly split the move-
ment.” Unfortunately, neither writer
defines what is meant by “Commu-
nist groups,” and Rex’s attempt (or
rather,_lack thereof) to distinguish
between Maoism and other con-
tending interpretations only con-

fuses the issue.

I find Rex’s view‘ of “Communists
knocking on the doors of Right-
Wingers and convincing them to
sign their petition. It’s scary," quite
interesting. I think that the irony in
such an act is quite amusing, but I
fail to see why he finds it frightening.

Rex would also do well to really
examine the aims of the nuclear
freeze movement. Its main focus is
not “a freeze on the research and
development of nuclear weapons”
but a halt to their acquisition and
deployment. It strikes me as difficult
to argue a position on an issue whose
fundamental point he fails to
recognize. »

I would also be very interested to
know how Rex would go about pre-
venting “Communist groups” from
joining the nuclear freeze move-
ment. Perhaps he would have them
show their party cards as an ade-
quate meansof identiﬁcation. »

But what disturbs me most of all I

about both articles and the notions

1- ‘L-*9 -'~.§‘.‘!~.-_~..'!'?.;!.‘.!',' -

seems to recognize that the‘adminis-
tration’s attacks on the nuclear
freeze movement began long before
there was any substantive evidence.
as to “Communist ” participation..
Both writers, in arguing that “Com-
munists” should not be permitted to
participate in the nuclear freeze
movement, overlook the critical ele-
ment in the program: namely, that
neither side can lose in agreeing to
such a freeze.

In attempting to short-circuit the
administration’s revival of
McCarthyism by focusing on “Com-
munist” participation in the move-
ment, the writers, in effect, bend to
Reagan et al and manage to encour-
age the very thing they aim to
prevent. .

I may be wrong in referring to the
“writers” throughout this letter
because I suspect that the same per-
son wrote both articles. If The Pitt
News really wants to look at instan-
ces of “infiltration,” Communist and
otherwise, its very own Opinion
Page might not be a bad place to
start. __

Socrates: Trucking OnThe Road Again

By sreve PARKS,

Harsh rain beat upon Socrates as he
stumbled blindly along the highway. Stick-
ing his thumb out every time a car whizzed
past, he was usually greeted with a splash
from a tire. In a fit of desperation, he steps
out in front of a truck and waves it down.
Socrates is greeted—not with a smilin
face—but with a white flag. ’

“Outta my way! I’m on my way home, so
there's nothing in my rig, and I agree with
the Independent Truckers strike.” ’

“Great,” said Socrates. “But what I would
really like is a ride.”

“Aren’t you a trucker?" asked the man,
sighing in relief.

“No, I’m a philospher. Could I have a ride
please?”

“Okay,” replied the man. “You aren't an
escapee from a mental hospital, are you? I
mean, isn’t that a hospital robe?”

“No, it’s a toga,” replied Socrates, climb-
ing into the rig. “Now what are the inde-
pendent truckers?”

“Independent truckers are just that. We’re A

loners who band together when something
"threatens our livelihoods. We’re an associa-
tion that helps each other out."

“So it’s voluntary help, and only when you
feel it is necessary!"

“Yeah! Otherwise we'd be like the Teams-
ters,” the trucker joked.

“What are they?”

“A union of truckers. They get the com-
pany to help them out, but you have to
follow the union even if you don't agree with
them. And you also have to pay them!”

" “What happens if you don’t agree with
them?”

“Well, it used to be that they'd hassle and
threaten you and maybe shoot at your rig.”

“What about now?”

“Now you follow them. Period!”

“Oh,” noted Socrates. “Is that why you’re
an independent trucker, so you can follow
your own ideas, without ’ the threat of
viol_e_nce.”

“Yeah,” he replied. “Me and the others.”

“So everyone does what they want, basi-
cally.” —

“Up until now!” he said.

“What do you mean?” ‘

“Well, some decided to strike against the
new gas tax, which the companies pay for

the teamsters, but if I strike, I’Il lose the rig.”

“Don't you people have a strike fund to
pay your bills?” Socrates asked.

“We don’t pay any dues to have one! So I
can’t afford to strike.”

“How’d your fellow truckers respond?"
asked Socrates.

“With threats.”

“Threats?,” Socrates said, startled.
“Yeah, they say the only way, the strike
will be effective is if everyone complies with
it.” A
“And if someone doesn’t comply with it?"
“They shoot at your truck, throw bricks at
your windows and other such things,” the
trucker said.
“Sounds like teamsters ‘used to!’ ”
Socrates suggested.
“Only worse!" _
“How could they be any worse?” asked

‘ Socrates.

“What alternatives do I have, either I
comply with the strike and lose my rig, or I
join a union where I have no freedom of
choice.”

“Why didn’t they try something else
before striking, such as jamming the
Washington streets with trucks or getting
the ordinary person to help—they’re as hurt

by the tax as much as you! Why not go to the
media and explain your plight instead of
having the media explain your violence?"

“The media cost too much,” argued the E

trucker. .

“More than a life?” asked Socrates. “And
what have all the threats and violence
accomplished?”

“ ’“It:s gotten me off the highway," he said.

I m just as much a victim as a person ‘who
can't buy the food I'd carry. Every time I try
to go to work, my life is in danger.“

“Why did you give me a ride then?"
Socrates asked, getting scared.

“With that outfit, I was hoping they would
think you were my wife‘. Hopefully they
won’t harm women."

As the last words left the trucker’s lips, a
brick game flying through the windshield

and bullets pierced the tires. The truck spun V

off the highway and into a ditch. Socrates
crashed through the glass, its shards tearing
at his flesh. As he sunk into the mud, blood
pouring from him, he could hear distant
ambulance sirens. He turned his head,
looked at the injured trucker and said, “I
guess they believe in equal rights!"

ADAM ANT
February 10, 1983
Stanley Theatre

By TODD ERKEL

The best live rock and roll specta-
cles combine fashion, theatrics and
dance with state-of-the-art technol-
ogy, changing the real to the surreal.
Adam Ant may have thought he
covered all those bases when, in fact,
all he was doing was masturbating
(figuratively speaking) his way
through the motions, hoping that
few of his pack of ant-people would
notice. They didn't. They only
screamed andmoaned and cried in
ecstacy, and when it was over,
neither would admit to the other that
he had faked the entire scene.

Ant & Co.‘ marched out onto the
stage under the "cover of the ”Fanfare
for Rocky" theme, signalling either
some funny rock—n-roll parody/bur-
lesque or unbridled bad camp. The
only example of the former came dur-
ing ”Rancheros” as Ant led the crowd
in echoes of ”Clint...Eeeeaaaast-

Insect,
Considering the overwhelming

and deafening response Ant received,

of pretentious foolery was not. Given
his swooning good looks and pirate-

wood.” The rest? Welcome to Camp

a bit of schtick was expected—a night "

 

ADAMANT

climactic

ecleures tcome out of post-
punk England, revealing myriad sub-

tleties behind the" gaudy war paint’
exterior. ”Ant—Music" was at once X

foretelling in its brashness, and yet
nostalgic in its approach to sounds
(i.e. the Duane Eddy-like guitar
lines). .

Ant pretty much ignored the musi-
cal elements this night, choosing
instead to bump and grind his, way
into the wide-open hearts of pre-teen
Pittsburgh. Idols have always existed
in rock—n-roll and, comparatively,
Ant is one of the more substantial;
but why play down to your audience?

the performer ut from genuine give
and take (why do you think a band as
incredibly torrid as The Rolling
Stones often bores live audiences to
tears?).

The placing of ”Goody Two Shoes”
at the beginning (3rd) of the set was
like pinching the Hindenberg, the
deflationary effects went barely
unnoticed, but Ant could just as eas-
ily have done it last, allowing the
audience to expire in one big ‘bang.
The frenzy sustained itself, the more
die-hard of the ant farm chipping in
big on ”Stand and Deliver" and ”Ran-
cheros,” and everyone knew ”Des-

operate But Not Serious."

The concert’s closing irony. and
ultimate downfall came ,when Ant
chose to pay homage to the one
artist—-fittingly dead by today's
youth's standards—who manages to
create the kind of dark-mystic aura
Ant once strived for. The cover of Jim
Morrison's ”Hello I Love You” failed
less in its execution than in its end
effect on what was thought to be a

”new music” show. All these kids put

on their best Square Pegs attire and
screamed right through running
mascara only to be left with the
remains of someone else’s hero. If
this generation is to return vitality to
its music, then icons like Adam Ant
will have .to better deliver the goods.

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ
Have you ever felt like you just

at his concert at the Stanley Theatre"
last week.

His first time in Pittsburgh as a solo
act, Collins displayed all of the wit,
personality and talents he has shown
in the past as singerIsongwri-

‘ terldrummer for Genesis, as well as a
sense of maturity he has recently L

acquired.
This time, he was more settled and
more subdued than when he has per-

formed with Genesis.
That’s not to say that he didn't con-

vey a tremendous stage presence and
intensity through both his voice and
lyrics——he shined during songs like
”Thunder and Lightening," "In the
Air Tonight,” ”I Cannot Believe It's
True," and ”This Must Be Love."
With the help of the Fabulous Jac-
cuzzis, an eight—piece band, Collins
mixed hard rock and cool jazz to pro-

duce a sound all his own, like in '

"Behind the Lines"and "It Don't Mat-

_ ter to Me."

His dexterity was evident when he
played the keyboards for "Don't Let

. Him Steal Your .Heart Away" and

performed a drum solo for ”The West
Side." The audience was on its feet
for "I. Missed Again," "Like China "
and Collins’ successful remake of the
Supremes' song, ”You Can't Hurry

' Love.”
Maybe one reason Collins has such .

a good rapport with the audience is
that he sings about real love—about
”holding "closely and never letting
go"——while other songwriters pro-
duce stuff about psuedo-, backseat-
of-a-car romance.

THE RITES OF SPRING: A STU-

BREAK IN FLORIDA .

By Bruce Iacobsen and Rollin Riggs
Arbor HouselPriam Books

For hundreds of thousands of col-
lege students, the spring break trip to
Florida is a near-ritual. And The Rites of
Spring, by Bruce Jacobsen and Rollin
Riggs, is available just in time to help
this year's migrating crowd plan their

vacations. The authors, recent Yale
graduates, decided that ”a compre-
hensive, insider's guide to Florida
during March and April" was essen-
tial, and their book fulfills
expectations. A

Detailed information was collected
via on-the-spot research at the areas
in question—the most popular cities
(Fort Lauderdale and Daytona) and
some attractive, lesser-known ones
(Fort Walton, Panama City). The

MOVIE LISTS
By Jeff Rovin
Signet Books

ious birthdays of stars, for instance,
or some real names or a few films
with animals in their titles. The opin-
ion lists are arbitrary and rather
pointless. Why does Rovin list his 10
”most stirring moments of heroism”
when everyone has his own favor-
ites? His ”just,when you thought
they were washed up” list of screen
comebacks (Peter O'Toole, Richard
Burton, Peter Sellers) is patronizing
and slightly incredible: did Farah
Fawcett really rise ”phoenixlike" in
The Cannonball Run?!

Undeniably, there are some fasci-
nating Curio items, though. Bette
Davis's list of favorite films is a sur-
prise (she includes The Old Man and the
Sea, of which she says, ”That perfor-
mance of Spenc_er’s—God!”). The
self—appraisals of well-known per-
formers are intriguing; ”I don't
always like myself as I am, and if I
hadn't been able to become an actor
I'd have been in despair," said Lau-
rence Olivier. And there are 16 pages
of unusual photographs, including a
very nice one of Walt Disney.

The Second Signet Book of Movie Lists is
not particularly valid as a reference
source, and it's not too much fun,
either. Save your bucks and wait for a
bargain matinee.

Don't get your hopes up — any
movie fan worth his ticket half can
come up with additions and excep-
tions to many of The Second Signet Book
of Movie Lists lists. To make the book
entirely complete, of course, would
be practically impossible-, but even a
casual reading reveals glaring omis-
sions. Why forget Jane and Peter
Fonda as acting offspring of an actor?
Or That Hamilton Woman as a film feat-
uring an eye-patched character (Lau-
rence Olivier as Horatio Nelson)? Or
Jack Lemmon from Some Like It Hot in a
man-dressed—as-woman role? How
about Kind Hearts and Coronets, which
fits under the list of films. featuring a
star in two or more roles (Alec Gui-
ness played eight parts in that one.)?

ence to Alfred Hitchcock, the ending
of Psycho is kept secret). Movie poster
advertising and occasional produc-
tion shots are included, as well as the
full screen credits, running times and
production notes.

Where applicable, some insight
into the director's purpose is offered.
For example, Sam Peckinpah, com-
ments on The Wild Bunch (1969), say-
ing, "I wanted to show what the hell it
feels like to get shot." The politics
behind a film are sometimes consi-
dered; for instance, the book says
that High Noon (19§2) is considered a
fable of the McCarthy era. On the
Waterfront (1954) is called another
statement about communism.

The reading is uncomplicated and
provides amiable companion pieces to

chronologically from 1934's The Thin
Man to 1976's Illustrious Corpses. In
between, look for Stagecoach, The Mal-
tese Falcon, My Darling Clementine, North

likely to find a few favorites among
those included. Good Guys and Bad Guys
is a satisfactory souvenir, especially if
you've seen many of the films.

PACIFIC voim-zxz B

By Clive Cussler
Bantam Books

Pacific Vortex! was the first adven-
ture that featured Dirk Pitt, hero of

- Vixen osand Raise The Titanic!, two of

Cussler’s most popular novels. This
novel was not meant to be published

but due to probable pressure by Pitt
fans and Cussler’s publishers, it was
released. _

The Pacific Vortex has a reputation
that is similar to that of the Bermuda
Triangle. When a new U.S. nuclear
sub is lost in the vortex, the search is
on. Dirk Pitt is brought into the plot
when he finds a capsule containing
the final message from the sub. Pitt
steps in and answers many questions
that have the navy stumped and
leads them to the sub.

Finding the submarine involves
locating a » small army of men
equipped with special scuba devices
and a secret to hide. The majority of
the pages involve the unravelling of
the vortex and exposure of the secret.

Pacific Vortex.’ is not the best written
of the Dirk Pitt adventures; actually,

it has few of the intricacies involved

——Pagc 13
a

in later Clive Cussler novels. If you
have never read one of his books, I
would first suggest reading The Medi-
terranean Caper, Night Probe! or one of
those mentioned above. These four
books are loaded with the highly
exciting reading that has made
Cussler popular. After you've read at‘
least one of these novels, Pacific Vortex!
should be read to see the improve-
ment in style.

Those of you who are familiar with;
Dirk Pitt and his adventures should;
pick up Vortex! to round out your col-
lection. A refresher on Pitt can be
found at the back of the book.

Whether you are an experienced‘.

Cussler reader or not, the story 
exciting and enjoyable. :

‘Without A Trace’

A Mother's

By MARY ANN .KRUPA

‘Movies that take on righteous
causes——such as child abuse—.often
take accidental, exploitative detours
in the process of defending the cause,
and a movie about disappearing child-

ren is not comfortable to contemplate C

for this reason.

Stories of this nature make popular
TV drama, but many would rather
spend their four movie dollars for
something, if not lighter, than at least
less emotionally antagonistic.

Without /i'Trace ‘focuses on a moth-
er's nightmare; her child departs for
school in the morning, and later in
the day, she, comes to the horrifying
realization that he never reached his

destination.

From that point on, the movie
becomes a tight, nervous coil of res-
trained horror as the boy's mother
watches the machinery—the press,
the public and the police — being set
in motion to recover her son. But
before long, the situation becomes
hers and hers alone. The days, weeks

and months pass; life resumes as ‘ Corkill) who suddenly disappears in Without/1 Trace.

intelligence and courage.

The mother, played by Kate Nelli-‘
gan (whose last major role in Eye of the
Needle was also a portrait of fierce,
maternal strength), maintains an art-
ful control over her own panic, refus-

ing to submit to the terror that lurksia

at every turn in her pursuit. She‘?
becomes the cool head amongst a
throng that loses perspective of her
plight and that of her little boy.

For this reason, Without a Trace suc-
ceeds as a story of a mother who is
determined to learn her child's fate at
any cost. The movie avoids exploiting
an ugly, sinister and heartbreaking
situation that threatens every
parent.

Judd Hirsch, of TV’s Taxi, plays a
supportive role of a detective
assigned to the case. He lends insight
into the predicament of police under
such volatile circumstances and is_
convincing as a man torn between his?
duty and his emotional investment in?
the case. "' '

Without a Trace, painful as the sub-
ject matter is, provides thoughtful
and intelligent entertainment.

can you go wrong with songs
like "Tutti Frutti," "Yakety
Yak," "Band of Gold" and even
"Auld Lang Syne"? You can't,
and that's why this record
works. -

The other reason it works is
the singers the producers chose:
Elvis Costello, who sings the
title track; Sting ("Tutti
Frutti"); Dave Edmunds, who
sings "Run Rudolph Run " well

TROUBLE IN PARADISE
Randy Newman
Warner Bros.

Randy Newman continues to
add to his ever-growing cast of
American fools and universal
foibles on Trouble In Paradise, dot-
ting them about the country
and the globe from ”Miami” to
South Africa.

He's dipped his pen back into
the rattler venom and come ‘out
jabbing at everything from
apartheid rule to the loss of
genuine romance. Newman's
voice here is at its mischievous
and warbly best, and the music

i has taken on a sharp, rock-n—roll

overbite that the L.A.—id back
music scene had long since cor-
rected “for the sake of
appearances.

You've got to listen between
the lines with Randy Newman,
or, as he once put it, ”it's not
music to barbeque by.” If you
still think the anthem ”Short
People" was meant to be taken
at face value then you've got it
all wrong. '

‘Trouble In Paradise has sort of
an anthem of its own, this time
centering on his birthplace and

home with ”I Love L.A..” Some V

of the city's most revered
'Angelenos—Lindsey Buck-
ingham and Christine McVie—
join in to chant ”we love it" in a
chorus that sounds like roll call
at the Royal Order of Buffalos’
meeting. _
The inescapable feeling one
gets from the record, and from
G‘ many of Newman's most acidic
perceptions, is that it's hurting
him more than anyone who
might get splashed i_n the pro-
cess. Even the upbeat duet with
Paul Simon, an irresistable. me-
lody called "The Blue” leaves
you with an unsettled feeling
that will never be danced away.
In between two vivid ballads,
”Same Girl,” and ”Real Emo-
tional Girl,” Newman litters

Begging
For A
Script

BY CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

With the exception of the New
‘Plays Festival at Carnegie-Mellon
University, you can usually count the
{number of new scripts produced by
Vtheater companies in Pittsburgh in a

fact I have consistently deplored, sol
was delighted to hear that the Pitts-
burgh Public Theatre, the city's only
resident all-Equity company, was
producing Aims For The Middle Class, a
new comedy by Stuart I-lample. After
attending the world premiere of Alms
"last week, I have one question for
artistic director Larry Arrick and the
members of the Public's board: Out

For more information and

you must have looked at, how could
you choose such a banal piece of fluff
as Alms to squander all that talent and
money upon?

Alms is full of Jewish angst, the arti-
ficiality of middle-class values and the
generation gap.‘ We've seen it all
before, which is not the point. Rarely
have we seen it done so clumsily.
I-lample’s script is contrived, self-
conscious and worse, about as funny
as Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelungen.
The characters are stereotypes and as
complex as those in a medieval moral-
ity play. There is the successful
middle—aged man who has sold his
dreams to buy a Mercedes; an aging
Jewish Princess utterly unable to deal
with the pressures of divorce; and a
teenager who rebels against his reli-
gion, his culture and (of course) his
father. ‘The situation Hample writes
about is all too real, but the truth is
hidden under a barrage of bad one-
liners and theatrical cliches.

There are some good moments in
Alms, specifically a seder that turns
into a dueling Groucho Marx-like
competition between father and son
and a delightfully obscene joke about

Henry_Kissinger. But moments do

not a play make, especially when one

considers the remainder of the two ’

hours spent in the theater.

Alms is beautifully mounted, and
designer Thomas A. Walsh's set, with
its surreal blending of time and place
and movable units, is wonderful.
Kristine Bick’s lighting is remarkably

.— effective, particularly in a driving

scene in which the high beams of
approaching cars periodically illumi-
nate the actors. The cost of Walsh's
set alone is probably equal to the
budget of the City Theatre Company’
for the entire season; the waste of
money on I-lample’s trivial ‘play
stings.

The acting talent in Alms is buried
under the weight of Hample’s script
and heavy-handed direction by Larry
Arrick. Richard Greene (no, not the
Richard Greene who played Robin
Hood) has an excellent sense of comic
timing and gives the father, Marshall,
more life than the writing deserves.

The House That Brecht Built

By LINDA HENRY

Being hit by a ton of bricks is not a
pleasant experience, and in this day of
mindless ”entertainment” program-
ming, accessible to nearly everyone
within the confines of his comforta-

ble living areas, it is risky business to

present a dramatic review of works
by a pIayw__right known for his heavy
intellectualism. However, if the
bricks are handled carefully and

stacked precisely, what can happen is '

fortified stimulation of‘ creative
thought, or as Bertolt -Brecht would
describe it, ”a call to action.” The Uni-

\versity of Pittsburgh Theatre Com-

pany’s production of Brecht on Brecht,
running ‘through Feb. 26, ista fine
tribute to the master bricklayer.
Directed by W. Stephen Coleman,
a member of Pitt's theatre arts

faculty,» the production manages for

the most part to find the fine balance
between pure Brechtian ideology and
more conventional entertainment.

P Coleman cast a striking ensemble.

of actors who moved through the
tightly choreographed production
freely, as though spellbound by the
words they were speaking. They
worked as a true team, particularly in
song numbers which included the
entire cast harmonizing.

But Arrick manipulates him like a
puppet, allowing him to overplay and
frequently flail his arms like a scare-
crow on fire. Evalyn Baron as the
mother, Doris, and Marcus Diamond
as the son, Ken (who prefers to be

‘addressed as Tender Coyote), do

what they can with I-Iample’s charac-
ters, but it is a losing battle. Timothy

'Donoghue does a professional job
with Keith, Ken's liberal and%;.__

extremely goyische headmaster, but
the role is so ridden with cliches as to
be unintentionally comic. Bethany
Faye Decof is Sarah, Ken's girlfriend,
but again, her talent is no match for
Hample’s relentless stereotyping.

Alms For The Middle Class continues
at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre
through March 20. The best that can
be said about it is that at least it is
keeping a number of talented actors
and technicians off the welfare rolls,
however, theater is supposed to do
much more. A

The women were brilliant in roles
not particularly becoming to their

’ sex. Elena Bertolino and Karla Boos

were delightful as whores arguing

over the affection of their shared A

"lover. Maura Minteer froze the
audience with her chilling rendition
of a forsaken love song, ”Surabaya-
Johnny,” and Caryn]. Ronis was star-

. tling in the most demanding scene of

the review, a monologue entitled

”The Jewish Wife" (although the ‘,
scene itself is a bit long, lasting  '

minutes).

It was a difficult performance to
put together since there was no dra-
matic throughline, only recurring
themes—hard to swallow over and
over again. The first act is too long,
but about the time you are ready to
scream ”enough is enough,” inter-
mission comes, followed by the
second act which is delightful.

Some of the messages Brecht pres-
ents I find abhorrent, some I admire,
but the attraction to this production
is not dependent upon whether or
not you agree with him but the fact

that he demands you to think about" I

what it is.you do believe in. Like
accomplished construction workers
erecting a house, the University of
Pittsburgh Theatre Company creates
this intended provocation. 0

Eitt Takes Lead“ In Big East Championships

By MIKE SIBERINI

The University of Pittsburgh is
hosting the Big East Swimming and
Diving Championships this week-
end, and if there is such a thing as a
home-pool advantage, both Pitt
teams are reaping maximum beneﬁt
from it.

-:”‘7After the first day of competition,
Pitt’s Panther and Lady Panther
teams are at the top of the standings.
The Lady Panthers have accumu-
lated _225 points to lead their nearest
competitor, Syracuse, by 65 points.

“It was an excellent day. This was
the best fust-day swim in a long,
long time,” women’s coach David

Belowich said. “I couldn't ask for a
better performance from the team.

The men‘s race is much closer; the
Panthers are in ﬁrst place with 171,
followed by Syracuse with 145.

Sue Heon paced both Pitt teams
with three wins. The junior swimmer
started off by breaking a conference
record—a feat that she ‘ would
accomplish twice again during the
evening—and qualifying for the
NCAA Championships in the 500-
yard freestyle. She ﬁnished in
4:54.27, over six seconds faster than
her time in the preliminary round
earlier in the day. In her next event,
the 200-yard individual medley, she
ﬁnished in a tie for ﬁrst with team-
mate Jan Ujevich. Both girls pushed

each other to another Big East
record of 2:07.60. After qualifying
ﬁrst overall in the 200-yard back-
stroke, Heon came back at night and
matched her performance, besting
the field in a time of 2:07.12.

The Panthers capped their day
with a win in one of the most excit-
ing races of the competition, the 400-
yard medley relay. Ed Bergan
(backstroke), Doug Condon (breast
stroke), Geoff Emore (butterﬂy) and
Jon Quinn (freestyle) battled back
and forth with Syracuse for the first
15 lengths of the pool before Quinn
took the lead from Orangeman
Robert Bonsall on the last turn.~The
junior freestyle specialist raced

home in front to ﬁnish in conference _

record time of 3:28.54. Pete Doyle
won the 50-yard freestyle (in 21.05,
another Big East record), and diver
Mark McCormick took the one-
meter event for the other Panther
victories.

The Panther diving team
accounted for 54 of the team‘s 171
points. All six divers placed in the
top 10 overall, including four out of
the top five positions.

-“I was overjoyed with the results,"
said diving coach Julian Krug. “The
freshmen really did the job.”

Wendy Morgan won the 50-yard
breast stroke and Georgia Spolsky,
Morgan, Nordine Burrell and Alicia
Dugan teamed for a victory in the

  Sports

‘200-yard medley relay.

Syracuse led the rest of the ﬁeld,
taking two ﬁrsts in both the men‘s
and women’s competitions. Chris
Black (500-yard freestyle), Todd
Cooper (200-yard individual med-
ley), Betsy Spiegel (one-meter diving
and the women’s 800—yard freestyle
relay) were the winners for the Or-
angemen. Villanova‘s Beth Metzer
was the only other victor of the day,
taking ﬁrst in the 100-yard butterﬂy
in 59.29—only 0.13 better than Pitt's
Burrell.

The championships resume 11:30

* a.m. today with the preliminaries at

Trees Pool. The second day’s finals
will begin at. 7 p.m.

Irish :
Slows
Down Pitt

 scorr DELLETT

Controlling the tempo of a game
is an important key to winning bas-

ketball games. Notre Dame made '

the Panther basketball team play its
game, and the result was a 60-54
Irish victory before 11,127 at the
Civic Arena Wednesday night.

“We controlled the tempo,” Irish

head coach Digger Phelps said. “We ~

felt we could beat them in the ’50s or
’60s. We were very patient.”

“I thought Notre Dame played
their game better than we did ours,”
Pitt head coach Roy Chipman said.

, TM/e tried to up-tempo the game, but

‘;\4;3<%-‘were unable to."

Part of the reason Pitt was unable
to play its game was that the Pan-
thers never gained the lead. Several
times the Irish lead was cut to one
point, but Pitt couldn’t hit the criti-
cal basket.

“In order to beat Notre Dame,”
Chipman said, “you've got to get
ahead and make them play. If you
don't get ahead, that’s the game.”

“We had to play catch—up, and
that’s tough to do against Notre
Dame,” Clyde Vaughan said. “We
knew we couldn’t let them get the
lead.” -

Usually, Vaughan would make
the key shot. But Notre Dame used a
variety of defenses to contain the 6-4

>'°-smrward. Although he had 17 points,
aughan only shot ﬁve for 15 from
the floor.

When Pitt did manage to come
close, Irish forward Bill Varner
managed‘ to make the important
basket. He hit a short jumper late in
the ﬁrst half to increase the Notre
Dame lead to 23-20. The senior for-
ward opened the second half with a
10-footjumper and two foul shots to
give the Irish an eight point margin,
30-22.

With the lead down by two,

Varner went inside, double-pumped

'  d scored, drawing a foul from Pitt

center Matt Miklasevich. -He com-

pleted the three point play, and

Notre Dame started to spread out
the offense.

Two Panthers stood out. Trent
Johnson did a good job on the offen-
sive boards, scoring 13 points and

Notre Dame’s Bill Varner (top) had a successful homecoming, scoring 21 points in the

Returns
Home

By BARRY ZASLOFF

He came from Valley High

School‘, where they ran holes in ten‘-Q

nis shoes and sometimes wandered
to the middle of New Kensington for
shot selection. It was said that Bill
Varner had a compass attached to
the ball, that he could find the basket
even if it was covered.

That was at Valley. Now Varner
plays for Notre Dame, where they
are’ trying their hardest to return
basketball to its original form,
where anyone who takes a shot
longer than 15 feet must answer to
Irish coach Digger Phelps. A pair of
shoes had better last the entire year.

Varner, who played in his home-
coming game against‘ Pitt last Wed-
nesday night at the Civic Arena,
might still prefer the running game,
though it was hardly noticeable after
Notre Dame’s 60-54 "victory. He
scored 2] points from an assortment
of inside shots, coming as close to
perfection as possible by hitting on
nine out of 10 chances.

Still, he wanted to run. He wanted
to step up the pace from the early
minutes of the game. Perhaps
visions of Valley High passed
through his mind. Phelps had other
thoughts.

“Slow down. Slow down,” Phelps
hollered from the sideline. “Be
patient; watch it; watch it.”

One by one, Pitt watched Varner’s
shots sail through the basket. If
anyone has deserved to be labelled a
scoring machine, it was Varner

Wednesday night. Even the slow,

pace couldn’t stop him.

“I’m still adjusting to this type of
tempo game," Varner said after
single-handedly strangling Pitt. “In
high school, we always used an,up-
tempo running offense.”

But then he went to Notre Dame,
where, for a while, things weren’t as
rosy as they were at Valley. He left
for South Bend a star. But for two
years he saw considerable time on

the bench. He had second thoughts 7

about his choice of Notre Dame.
Luck, it seemed, was not on his side.

“I thought about leaving because I
wasn't playing that much. In high
school, you’re a start_er...a star on a
team,” Varner said. “It ,_ was _ my
decision—no.one. told me if I should
stay or leave. I made the decision on

When the Panther track team
travels to Syracuse tomorrow for the
Big East Indoor Track Champion-
ships, it will face perhaps the tough-
est competiton that the conference
can provide.

“The Big East has to be consid-
ered as one of the top track confer-
ences’in the country, if not the top,”
Panther head coach John Vasvary
said.

In evaluating the opposition, Vas-

-vary finds extraordinary strengths

on every team.

“There isn’t one slouch in the con-
ference,” he said. “Any of the teams
are capable of scoring a lot of points.
Villanova is heads above everyone in
the conference from a team stand-
point. They have outstanding depth
and balance. They also have the
experience.

“Connecticut and Syracuse are
both very strong all-around teams,
especially in the ﬁeld events. U-
Conn was the outdoor champion
last year, and Syracuse has the lux-
ury- of hosting the meet.

“St. John’s is a young, well-
balanced team who returnsthe Big
East champion shot putter, Ray Ian-
naconne,” he added. “Georgetown
and Providence have excellent mid-
dle and long distance runners and
could really have a strong impact
fr‘om a team standpoint.

“Seton Hall and Boston College
are known for their jumpers, but
they appear to have very strong all-
around teams this year. Last season,
Seton Hall, won the indoor
championships.”

Despite the outstanding competi-
tion, Vasvary believes that his
Panthers have some advantages.

“No one is expecting us to do any-
thing at this meet,” he said. “We
have had a pretty good indoor sea-

son with some very fine performan-
ces against some very stiff
competition.

“Aside from Villanova, I don‘t
think that anybody else in the con-
ference has competed as extensively
as we have. I

“I think if our guys .just worry
about doing what they do best
instead of worrying about the things
that they have no conrol over, then
we can be very competitive.”

Vasvary believes a total of 100

points will win the meet. Last yeaelri-0' '

Seton Hall edged Villanova by one
point, 109-108, for the team title.

Villanova coach Jack Pyrah
believes that this year’s meet is likely
to be just as competitve.

“It should be a good all-around
meet,” he said. “Connecticut, Syra-
cuse and Seton Hall have very
strong teams. Pitt will add a lot of
quality to the middle distance
events, which will hurt us. It will be a
battle, but I feel we will definitely be
in the battle.”

Villanova returns several bona-
fide superstars. Senior hurdler Rod-
ney Wilson was the 1980 NCAA
55-meter hurdles champ, and in.

1981 "and 1982, he finished secon-3.7%
and third, respectively. John Mar-

shall is the collegiate record holder
in the 800-meter run. Marcus O’Sul-
livan is the conference’s toplmiler;
twice this season he has run the mile
in under four minutes. And a
Pittsburgh-area native, Mike Eng-
land of Hampton Township, who
was last year’s 800-meter Big East
champ, also returns.

One of the mystery teams will be
St. J ohn’s.. Of the 36-man roster, 20
did not appear last year.

Third-year coach Peter Mahoney
believes that the program—like
Pitt’s—is on the upswing.

“We finished sixth last year in the . .
Big East and just had a bad ye 9-‘

overall,” he said. “We have 20 new
faces, of which 1] are freshmen.

“I think we had a super recruiting
year, but since we are so young, we
are going to make mistakes. We feel
that we have a good shot at fourth
place if we have a good meet.”

Aside from the 20 new members,
the Redmen return a few expe-
rienced competitors.

Senior hurdler Mark Nigro, who
was third in the outdoor Inter-
Collegiate Amateur Athletic Associ-
ation of America Championships in
’82, will run the 500-meter run.
Senior Pat Wood, who recently ran
a 3:49.9 in the 1,500-meter run, will

compete in the same event. Jungigg-,.‘,_;:.
Mike Regan is entered in the 3,000-

meter run, which he ran in 8: I4 two
weeks ago. And Iannaconne, the ’82
Big East shot put champ, also
returns. .

For the Panthers, Vasvary has
entered 18 members in 15 different
events.

‘Rick Asberry, Rich Baderinwa
and Joe McCall are scheduled for
the 55—meter dash. In the 55-meter
hurdles, Roger Kingdom, McCall,
Brian Pollock and Darryl Shepherd
are competing. Asberry, Baderinwa
and Pollock will also compete in the
300-meter run.

In the 400-meter run, Mario
Joyner is scheduled, while Terry
Gallagher is entered in the 500-meter
run.

Darren Gcary and‘ Garland-M
Brown are to compete in the 800- 

meter run, and Todd Colas and Bill
Moorehead will represent the
Panthers in the 1,000-meter run.

Pitt will also ﬁeld three relay
teams—the 1,600-meter team of
Joyner, Pollock, Baderinwa and
Gcary, the 3,200-meter team of
Brown, Gallagher, Colas and
Moorehead and the distance-medley
relay team of Gallagher, Pcllock,
Brown and Moorehead.

In the field events, Ralph Mitton
and Joe McCall will compete in the
long jump, while Mitton is entered

in the triple jump along with R0 

Goldberg. Kingdom will compete in~'
the high jump.

In the shot put, Bob Buczkowski
is scheduled, and Rob Chobany is
entered in the pole vault.

By DALE MOORE

The hour of truth is drawing near
for the Lady Panther indoor track
team. After weeks of training, Pitt
will visit the Carrier Dome in Syra-
cuse this weekend for the Big East
Indoor Track and Field
Championships.

As this is the first Big East cham-
pionship to be held in women‘s
indoor track and field, no one is sure
what to expect, except intense
competition.

“Villanova has a lot of good
bodies,” St. John‘s coach Pete Ma-
honey said. “Connecticut has a lot of
good ladies everywhere, too. We’re
not up to our usual level, but we
have big meet experience. I hope to
do well.”

Carrying the hopes for St. John's
on the track will be Shell Rice, who
is ranked sixth in the East in the
hurdles. Mahoney believes she will

, place high in the 55-meter hurdles,

the 55-meter dash and the 300-meter
dash. Also helping St. John's cause

will be long jumper Tracey Winn,

who is the indoor Eastern champion
with a jump of 18-9 3/4.

Villanova is regarded as the favor-
ite at the contest. “I expect a compet-
ititive team battle,” Villanova coach

Bob Shoudt said. “We have to be ‘

one of the top teams.”

Villanova seems to have the ath-
letes to back up Shoudt’s claim.
Peggy Stewart is an All-America in
four different events and returning
national champion in the 400-meter
hurdles. Other All-Americas on the
Wildcat squad include Patty Brad-
ley in the 800-meter run, Veronica
Mclntosh in the 400- and 600-meter
runs and the mile and two-mile
relays and Mary Ellan McGowan in
the 3,000-meter run.

Also expected to finish near the
top (will be the Syracuse
Orangewomen. Coach Andy Jugan
also believes the competition is more
difficult.

“The women are at the same point
the men were at four years ago," he
said. “Everybody has quality people,
but there will be a lot of cheap
points. The team championship may

come down to who has the most
bodies.” —

Some of his quality people include
sprinter Lisa George, long jumper
Sharon Daniels and shot putter Ann
Sharkey, who has thrown over 40
feet this season.

Unfortunately for Syracuse, they
don’t seem to have enough people to
"keep up with Villanova or Connecti-
cut in the team competition.

Pitt also has a shortage of partici-
pants, but those available should
provide competition for the rest of,

the Big East. While the quantity ma~‘3-‘i~».,’ '

seem small, Kennedy believes the
quality is there.

“I want all the girls to place in the
top six,” said Kennedy, who believes
that this year’s Big East meet is
important to the future of the
women's track program. “This year,
nobody may be worrying about us,
but with a good showing, we can
give them something to think about
for the future.”

The future should be bright for
the women’s track program. The
oldest competitior for Pitt this week-
end will be sophomore Renee‘
Henderson.

dashes and with Sue Torre, Gail
Counts and Marsha Hawkins in the
mile relay.

Along with the mile relay, Counts
will also be running the 55- and 300-
meter dashes. Torre will compete in
the 400-meter run; Hawkins will
represent Pitt in the 55-meter
hurdles.

Freshman Amy DiFrancesco will
run against some of the best distance
runners in the country in the l,500-
meter and 3,000-meter 111115.

son have been directed at doing well
in this weekend’s championships.

“Allithat matters is to run this
weekend,” said Torre, who has been
bothered with a thigh injury. “No
matter what happens, I am going to
run this weekend.”

- For Torre and the others, this
weekend is a chance to see what they
have accomplished and to find out
how well they match up with some of
the nation’s best. It also will show
them how close they are to reaching
this level themselves.

Clarion

By TIM DINGER

The Panther wrestling team ends
it dual-meet season with a trip to
Clarion to take on the Golden
Eagles Saturday.

The injury-plagued Panthers
come into the Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL) match-up with a 3-3
record, 8-6 overall, while Clarion
enters at 9-6.

“They come on well as a team. All
their injuries are back, and they’re

going to show us the best p0SSible€}.1~‘

lineup they can,” assistant coach‘
Chuck Coryea said. “They are a
tough team to wrestle. They’re men-
tally tough right now, and if we’re
going to beat them, We’re going to
have to win all the close ones.”
Although Clarion will have all the
injured wrestlers back, the Panthers
won’t. The Panthers were hard hit
early in the season with losses of
starters John Hnath (126 lbs.) and
Doug Haines (158 lbs.) and high
school All-American Jack Uppling

, (177 lbs.).

The latest victims on the Panther

starting lineup are Frank Rich (17:77

lbs.), who recently had knee surgery,
and freshman Joe Bond, who missed
the last two matches because of an
ankle injury. Z

Starting off for the Panthers will
be freshman Kyle Nellis (14-8) going
against -___Clarion’,s, Jamie Kasser.

low brick road to victory with a 30-
point, ll-rebound performance.
Twenty points came in the second
half after a sluggish first half in
which Pitt could only muster a slim
three-point lead.

In the team’s six-game winning

streak, Bruce has amassed 153’

points to average 25.5 points per
game. Besides being Pitt’s leading
scorer, the sophomore tri-captain
also tops the Big East in scoring with
19.6 points per game.

The Lady Panthers got off to a L

sluggish start, failing to score until
nearly four minutes had lapsed. A
pair of 18-footjumpshots by sopho-
more Stephanie Collins put Pitt
ahead in the early going, but the
teams traded the lead several times
in the next ten minutes. The home
team finally took the lead for keeps
on an 18-foot jumper by freshman
guard Kim Tirik with 5:14 to go in
the first half. Pitt took a three-point
lead into the locker room at half-
time, 27-24.

Hot outside shooting and board
control lengthened the Lady
Panther lead in the second half.
Senior tri-captain P_amMi__klasevich
scored 14 of her 18 points in the
second half, most of them in the 14-
to-l6 foot range. The Lady Pan-
thers shot 62 percent in the final
twenty minutes, compared to only
32.4 percent in the first half.

Pitt also took control of the
boards\afte‘r half-time, snaring 22

rebounds to Georgetown’s 12. With
time running out, the Lady Panthers
spread out their offense, taking the

easy basket hoops: seven of the last *

scores were lay-ups. Georgetown
responded by fouling and gave the
Lady Panthers 12 shots from the
free-throw line, making nine. The

seven rebounds. Pitt outrebounded
Notre Dame, 23-19 despite being
outsized. Guard George Allen took
command offensively in the ;_.
half, scoring all ll points after half-
time. His steal and layup cut Notre
Dame’s lead to three, 49-46, with
two minutes left, but that’s as close

as Pitt got.

Chipman wasn’t pleased with sev-
eral aspects of the game. One was the

absence of the clock.

“It’s a tough adjustment playing
without the clock,” he said. “For
Notre Dame, the adjustment was

small.

“It’s got to be consistent for ev-
eryone. If we have a shot clock, fine,

let’s have it for everyone.”

. 
Another was the crowd noise ;‘{,.g;"r

the Civic Arena. “It wasn’t a bad
crowd, but it was a little disappoint-
ing,” Chipman said. “The students
were out in full force, but with the
arena three—quarters full, the noise
isn’t the same as the Fitzgerald Field

House.

“I like not to play games at the
Civic Arena unless the place is

packed.” -

Tomorrow at the Fitzgerald Field

thers will face a team with a different

At 134 lbs., Joe Throckmorton‘

(14-5) will take on Mark Ciccarello
of Clarion. The match is important
not only for both the wrestlers in the
dual meet, but also for seeding for

—éI18Xt week’s EWL Championships.

The winner of the match will go into
the tournament with a second seed;
the loser will be seeded third.

At 142 lbs. the Panthers will show
either junior Craig Richey (5-6) or
freshman Gary Bolin (4-5) against
Ken Nellis of Clarion. Nellis, the
older brother of Pitt 118-pounder
Kyle Nellis and former teammate of

Varner Returns

. »,To Hometown

c_oltz'nued-from pgge seventeen
my own, and I decided to stick it
out.”

Pitt might be sorry he travelled
that path. Each time the Panthers
threatened to take the lead—which
they never did—~Varner, a 6-6
senior, somehow worked his way
free for an open shot. He was des-
tined to drive a nail through the col-
lege he almost attended.

“I considered Pitt,” Varner said,
“but I decided it would be better for

' me to go away and grow up. If I

would've come to Pitt, I would have
-,gone home every weekend, and I

.. '-would not have matured.”

On the court, Varner matured
against Pitt. He was averaging just

under 10 points and five rebounds a I

game, and he was the sixth man off
the bench, until Notre Dame’s recent
loss to Fordham. Then, to Pitt’s dis-
may, he again became a starter.
And, for Varner, the new begin-
ning started right here in his home-
town, where he wore out that first
pair of shoes and made that ﬁrst
jump shot. They came out en masse
from the Valley area. Varner said
that he gave out 25 tickets to friends
and relatives. His high school and
junior high teachers bought 100
tickets, and his grade school

, jzteachers purchased 30 tickets.

“My friends ‘were teasing me
about this game, which made me
even more ﬁred up,” Varner said.
“And my sister goes to Pitt. She
knows Clyde (Vaughan), and they
were teasing each other all this week
about the game.

Now, Varner can do all the teas-
ing. He played perhaps the best
game of his life before a group of
people that had already witnessed
some of his monstrous feats.

“This was Billy’s‘ game," Phelps
said. “He’s been waiting four years
for this.”

ents the Panthers with their toughest
team challlenge of the season.
Although they rose to the occasion
at the VMI meet two weeks ago, they
still have their work cut out this
weekend. '

Bolin, is last year’s EWL runner-up
at 142 lbs.

At 150 lbs., if Bond is ready, he'll
face Glenn Ammon of Clarion. If
not, freshman Eric Wertz (1-4) will
get the call for Pitt.

At 158 lbs., Jeff Ielic (I6-6) will
wrestle against Clarion’s Nate Cater.
This match is also important to both
wrestlers for next week’s seeding.

The 167-lb. weight class is open to
several wrestlers for Pitt. If Bond
starts at 150 lbs., then a likely candi-
date for the Panthers will be 150-
pounder Eric Wertz. [If Bond doesn’t
wrestle, forcing Wertz down in
weight class, then either freshman
Vince Augello or Sherman Moyer
will take to the mats against former
EWL runner-up Rob Albert of
Clarion.

The loss of Rich at 177 lbs. gives
Clarion’s Brian Kesneck the default

Panther Grapplers Face Clarion

win.

At 190 lbs., Panther Kurt Karano—
vich (l4-2-l) wrestles his last dual-
meet match at Pitt against Clarion’s

 Jim Beichner.

Closing out the match will be hea-
vyweights Dan Kasperkoski (6-1 1-1)
of Pitt andtwo-time EWL runner-
up Curt Olson of Clarion.

“Clarion has been wrestling great
lately, and this being a road trip for
us and their having good wrestling
fans in that area, it’s going to be a
tough match for us,” Coryea said.
“We’re going to-have to win the first
eight matches if we want to win.”

After tomorrow’s match, the
Panthers will prepare to go into the
Eastern Wrestling League Cham-
pionships next week at Clarion in

order to qualify for the National '

tournament two weeks later.
