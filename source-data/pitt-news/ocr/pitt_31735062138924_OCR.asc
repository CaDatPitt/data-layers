Alumni Council Chooses iRidinger—
Absentees Are Dropped—Consti-
tution Is Discussed.

 

At the first meeting of the new
Alumni Council last Monday night C.
W. Ridinger, an alumnus -of the En-
gineering School, was elected chair-
man of the Council ‘for the ensuing
year. Mr. Ridinger has been an ac-

tive "member of the Coiincil for sev-

eral years and has been prominent in
many of the alumni activities. He, is
at present serving on the Athletic
Committee. As a testimonial ‘of his
good work in the past, he was elected
by an unanimous vote.

Owing to the small attendance at
the last meeting, eighteenout of the
total membership of fifty, a lively dis-
cussion took place upon the question
ofdropping men who have been ab-
sent for three consecutive meetings
The Council ﬁnally voted to drop all
members who have been absent for
three or more consecutive -times.’ An
election was then held to elect men
to ﬁll the places thus vacated. The
election resultedpas follows; I. H.
Aronson, Law School; P. V. McPar-
land, School of Dentistry; A. W. Mc-
Cullough, Delegate at Large. Other
vacancies will be filled at the next
meeting of the council. It was de-
termined that in the future vigorous
measures would be taken to insure
a full attendance. '

SENATE DANCE DROPPED.

 

At the meeting of the Senate last
Friday it was decided to drop the ar-
rangements already made for the
Senate dance, as the lighting contract
had not been given and also the con-
tract for the road to the gymnasium
had not been awarded.

A vote of thanks was sent to the
Freshman class for its consistent and
good work on the day and night of the
parade. _

It was reported that the formal
opening of the gymnasium would not
be until commencement week.

CHARLES M. BREGG

SPEAKS TO. CLASS

Prominent Newspaper Man Makes
Address to Journalism Students.

Mr. Chgrles M. “Bregg, dramaitic
editor of the Gazette—Times, .and
prominent in local newspaper circles,
addressed the students of the Journal-
ism class of the University on last
Monday evening. He spokeon “The

.Higher Side of Newspaper Work.”

He expressed the hope that, the news-
papers would soon see a great re-
demption and check the tendency of
the newspapers to become nothing
more than straight commercial enter-
p"ises. He said in part: I

“The business of» a newspaper is
divided into two distinct parts, the
active part and the journa.listic_\part.
Each parteis important and neither
department could well exist without
the aid and co-operation of the other,
but their ﬁelds of activity are entirely
apart. The active -part is ‘composed
of those men who get news, get ad-
vertisements, write heads and do

everything in this line of work. The

j0urnalis‘ic side iscom-posed of those
men who try to write such things as
will be an expression of the people,
and such things as may lead the peo-
ple in the right path.

“I have been in the newspaper,
business for twenty years and yet I
am unable to write a head. I’ cannot
es-timaete space at all, no matter how
muc-h I try. They often say down at
the oﬂice. Did Bregg w-rite this?
Well, for goodness sake, get some-
one +0 write a head on it.’

“But, while I would not last very
long -on -the actual active force of a
newspaper, still I feel sure that in
journalistic side, I can exert consider-
able inﬂuence.

“In my particular line of work-
dramatic criticisrn—while now almost
.a lost art in the newspaper ﬁeld,, still
where it still exist-s, it exerts a
powerful inﬂuence. There is a tend-
to think that the
great mass of people don’t know any-
thing and that you must -‘write d-own
to them. This idea is all wrong, a
fallacy which should be corrected.
The same idea prevails in the thea-
ters. They try to play down to the
public—-try to get down as low as
they can, instead of playing up.
The journalist may exert a great in-
ﬂuen-ce for good in this line. _

“There -is no great fortune in news-
paper work. Don’t go into this line
of work if you want to make a for-
tune. But if you want to d-o a great

/I work for humanity; to get into close
‘relationship with the great mass of

the people; to be able -to -exert a mar-
inﬂuence for g-o»od—-go iznto
journalism with high ideals and stick
to them.

“If the present day~ newspaper
business is to be made better, if .a
great redemption is to take- place and
the newspaper business -is to *-be raised
from its present depraved condition.
the young blood now going into the
work must go in with high ideals and
a spirit of independence, backed‘ up

by a policy of honesty and integrity.
Hold to your ideals and have a con-*
sistent policy and you will be able to
do «a great work in any line of jour-
nalism you may take up.”

COST OF LIVING DISCUSSED
BY DROHOLDSWORTH

 

(Continued from Page 1)

recent rise in the cost of the necessi-
ties of life has covere-d almost all
commodities and countries. The slow
increase in wages and salaries, which
have not kept pace w't-h the increas-
ing level of prices, has caused severe
hardship to thousands and great dis-
tunbance to general/business.”

Dr. Holdsworth urges the exten-
sion of truck gardening and the CLl'llIl'\
vation of idle land in the vicinity of
Pi‘t:burgh. ,

“Pittsburgh, groaning under the in-
creasing burden of high prices, should
be deeply interested in «the develop-
ment of the farm lands, naturally
tributary to the district. One chief
agency for the reduction of the high
cost of living is intensive culttivation
of the soil and truck gardening. In

every direction from the city are sec-

tions excellently adapted, to trucking.
“Every effort should be made to de-

"_velop and extend these tracts. It may

be stated conﬁdently, however, that
this development will not c-ome of
itself. Conditions are such that en-
couragement and help are necessary.
The agricultural experiment station at
State College is doing good work in
acquainting farmers with the best
agricultural methods. Elsewhere the
railroads have done much to stimulate
agriculture.” .
Considerable space is given by Dr.
Holdsworth in his report to’ the case
of the middlemian. He says_ in part:
“An analysis of the distributive pro-
cess, the machinery and agencies by
which food products and other neces-
sities of life are brought to the con-
sumer presents many diﬂiculties and
antagonisms. In recent di-scussions of
the cost of l.iving problem the middle-
«man has received his fair share of
criticism and abuse. Standing be-
tween the producer and the consumer
the middleman has been charged by
both ‘with rapaciity, greed and oppres-
sion. The class of «merchanrts and
dealers known as middlemen is
divided into jobber, wholesaler, re-
tailer, broker, commission merchant,
agent, etc., each bent upon getting as

‘much as he can out of the handling

of the product, and in many oases
each accusing the other of getting too
large a share.

“At the outset it must be clearly
recognized that the middleman is 3
-natural and necessary adjunct to pres-
ent day distribution.
ligent person believe that in this day
he -can dispense with the grocery
store and the butcher -shop? In turn
-the grocer cannot see how it would
be possible to handle his business
without the services and credit ex-
tended to him by the wholesale dealer.
Generally the retailer, because of his
small capital and limited storage
room, must buy ‘his goods in small

Does any intel- S

quantities and often his proﬁt comes
from the frequent turn over ofihis
merchandise, and he has to depend
upon the large and varied stock -of the
jo.bber’s warehouse to keep up his
supply. The manufacturer, and, for

«the most part, the wholesaler, is not

equipped to retail his product. It is
true, however, that the catalog, or
‘factory to family’ plan of distribution
is increasing rapidly, especially in the
west. The produce or ‘commission
man ‘brings the fruit and produce of
d'stant regions wit'hin reanoh of the
consumer; the butcher shop iandthe
b_utter store put him into -touch with
the farm, the packing house, and the
creamery.

“The consumer has neither the time
nor the facilities to procure the hun-
dred and one commodities that go to
make up life’s necessities. The mid-
dleman di-d no-t impose ‘himself upon
the consumer or the producer; he is
simply an agency evolved out of the
necessities of the distributive process
and as such he is fairly entitled to a
legitimate return for the service he
renders the community. Evidence is
not lacking to show that both -the job-
ber and the retailer are selling goods
todayon a smaller margin than in
former years. Certain it is that the
cost o-fdoinig business has increased
:both to the retailer and the whole-
saler. In the general condemnation

of the middleman as being responsible -

for the high cost of living, it is‘ for-

gotten that 25 years «ago they -were.’

pushing business just as vigorously as
now, yet prices declined steadily for
years.” I I ’

It is expected that “Dr. Holdsworth
will issue several more reports soon
on other phases of the Pittsburgh
survey. ’

OUR DEBATERS.

Every Pitt man interested in de-
bate is rejoicing. over the double vic-
V, tory achieved by our teams last Fri-

~ day. The fact that Pitt won when

defending both sidessof the question
U-emphasizes the strength of our men.

In recalling that we have in the last
 two years been remarkably success-

ful, winning three out of the four de-

-bates held in that time, much credit

is due t-o the change of spirit in the
A’ student bo_dy toward this side of in-
._ gte/rcollegiate activity. For a long

A-time ‘Pitt was unsuccessful in debat-
ing because the students were not in-
 f terested. Last year we won our ﬁrst
 ~ victory in years by a unanimous vote.
A -_ "This year we were successful in win-
Wning both debates in the triangular
league.

 

3' This sudden and unexpected change
"in our fortune is due directly to the
great interest which the student body
has, recently taken in the intercol-

legiate debates. Anot‘her source of
_ success has been, the careful coaching

“which the teams have received. Un-
til the last two years no systematic
training was given the men on the
team. Now as a result of a ﬁne c-oach-
_ " ing__,-.systei:n which is constantly im-
‘"1"-_;_proving, Pitt is forging rapidly to the

 

 

H‘ ﬁfront. Mr. Fish deserves the hearty
thanks of the undergraduates and
alumni for . the painstaking efforts

A I which he has devoted to the strength-
ening of our debating teams.
The success of our teams last week
‘is but ajsign--of our future progress
’ “in this line of undergraduate activity.
No person knowing the difficulties
which have hindered our men in the
~.-past can -doubt that it will be far
"easier in the future to develop men
g of the ﬁnest caliber.

 

CREDITS.

_ The recent action of -the faculty
 granting credits for class work to

 

those men who perform ‘a reasonable
amount of work on the school paper
is one which will aid greatly in the
task of making the school paper
more efﬁcient. These credits are not
being given. with the idea in View
that the work on the Pitt Weekly
will serve as a substitute for regular
class work, but because those men
who have taken part in this phase of
student activity have been forced in

. the past to sacriﬁce their class work

in‘ order to do good work on the
paper. It seems but just that when
a man is willing to sacriﬁce a large
part of his time to the duty required
by his loyalty to the school, he should
receive some recompense. The
am-ount of credits granted will by no
means be suﬂicient to countenbalance
the number of credits which a man
loses through his work on the
Weekly, ,but they do enable him to
devote his best energies to the paper
without greatly hindering him in his
school work. A

It is the policy of this paper to
build up a staff which will be always
well-trained, ready for any emerg-
ency. The recent action of the fac-
ulty will be a great help in the future
in carrying out this policy. With the
‘worst trouble of the men who work
on the paper removed, fear that their
work would prevent them from ac-
quiring sufficient credits to "graduate.
many more men will in all probability
apply for positions and those at pres-
ent on the staff will be enabled to do
better work. The than-ks of -the
Weekly staff and their constituents
are -due the members of the faculty
for their very helpful attitude toward
this student publication. Wi-th such
help as they have this year tendered
mucli easier has been the work of the
staff. "

MR. BREGG‘S SPEECH.

1 Those members of the class in jour-
nalism who were present at the lee-
ture given by Charles M. Bregg, dra-
matic editor of the Gazette-Times, on
last Monday evening, were treated to
one of the most powerful speeches
ever given in this-University or any
other school. After listening to the
speech which Mr. Bregg delivered, it
is easy to understand how he gives
such straightforward and honest
criticismhon every play that comes to
the city. Mr. Bregg spoke with an
enthusiasm and earnestness that
comes only from a whole hearted in-
terest in his\work and a desire to
make for the betterment of his pro-
fession. If every man that goes in to
the profession of journalism from this
time on would only -take to heart the
plea of Mr. Bregg to go into the pro-
fession with high ideals and stick to
his ideals at any cost, there is no
doubt that the ‘newspapers of this
country would soon see the redemp-
tion, which the speaker so earnestly
desired. Such men .as Mr. Bregg can-
not come too often to speak to the
studvnts of the University and to in-
still in the minds of the students the
fact that, it is-not a question of how
much money you can make, but how
much good you can do, that counts.

‘Pitt "Patts

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Sir :-—It is the desire of many‘-stu-
dents that the school paper take a de-
cided stand upon the question of se-
curing adequate restaurent facilities
within reach of the school. At the
present time, we need a low-priced
luncheon counter.
land can a man secure a‘ lunch at noon
at a fair price. In this school we-;
should have a restaurant where all]
the students might eat together.
Aside from the advantage which such
an undertaking would be to the stu-
dents ﬁnancially, it would tend-to fos-
ter school spirit. All of them eating
in one place would be a pojwerfulé
force in increasing the loyalty of ourl
men to their school.

One feature of all club and fra-
ternity houses is the loyalty «which
they generate for their schools‘
through the constant association with
one of their members or another.
The same loyalty would be aroused
in the whole student body by the in-
stallation of an efficient low-priced
“Union,” a system which is in use in
many schools at «the present time. A
co-operative restaurant is just as
necessary for the student’s welfare as
a co-operative Ibo-okstore. We do not.
-have the latter even "now, but in my
judgment it is but a question of a
short time before one will be started.
It is something which the students
demand and which they will getin the
near future.‘ If by no other method,
the last of these two needed_changes
will be brought about by some ener-
getic group of students organizing a
club for the purpose of securing their
books at the wholesale price. I trust
the Weekly will give me this oppor-
tunity of expressing my beliefs on the
improvements in handling our stu-
dent body, which I deem necessary
i-mmediately.

Yours respectfully,
An Upperclassman.

ThQ came, they saw, but that is as
far as they got along the line of
Caesar’s famous phrase: “Hiky, Deky,

FENCING ASSOCIATION
HAS BEEN FORMED

New Organization Will Endeavor to
Place Pitt in Big League.

Deﬁnite steps were taken last
Thursday afternoon to organize -.,a
fencing association in the University
of Pittsburgh. It is «the aim of the
association to obtain membership in
th-e Intercollegiate Fencing Associa-
tion of United States. At the meet-
ing a constitution was adopted, stat-
ing that the object of the club will be
to foster and maintain the art of
fencing in the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Next year the team will have dual
meets with University of Pennsyl-
vania and Cornell. The winning team
will go to New York to fence in the
ball room of the ‘Wald-orf-Astoria.

There are twenty-six members in
the ass-ociation now and it was de-
cided to limit the membership to
«thirty-ﬁve and to charge an initiation
fee of one dollar.

Mr. Postgate o-f the P. A. A., who
will coach the men, was very well
satisﬁed with the work done by the
men in the two practices ‘held thus
far. _He said: “If the men continue
as they have started we will -be able
to have regular fencing bouts‘ about
«the ﬁrst of May. ~He hopes to pro-
duce a team by nextyear which will
rank with the best in the association.

Meetings of the club are held Tue's-
day evenings and Thursday after-
noons in the chapel. Any one inter-
ested in fencing is‘. encouraged to
come out. 1

Theo cers elected are; F. Wilbert
’l3, president.
R. K. Smith,
treasurer. . _

E. E. Paﬁ, ’l3, manager.

CROSS COUNTRY RUN.

’14, secr-etary and

Cross country runs will be ’held
each Wednesday and Friday’after-
noon at three—thirty. ' Director Miller
has arranged to have the men who
can do a rthree—mile run under a cer-
tain limi-t receive a “cross-country
button.” The limit will be ‘made high
enough that several men can earn the
button, but will be low enough that
a man cannot earn it the ﬁrst day he
runs.

ATENNIHS CANDIDATES.

The tennis arrangements are under
full swing and candidates are re-

_.quested to give their names to Di-

rector Miller or Manager Ma-cKrell
before March 29. Drawing for the
tournament will be made at that time
and no candidates will be allowed to
try for the team if their names are
notpon the lis-t when the drawing is
made. A ’ V " '

ATHLETIC LEADERS .
ARE H_0NORED

At a meeting of the Board 'of_Di-
rectors of the Pittsburgh Athletic As-
sociation on March '15, the following
Athletic Committee was elected:

Chas. S. Miller, Chairman; ']as. H.
Thompson, Karl E. Davis, John B.
Barbour, Prof. Andrew Kerr, Dr. Paul
H. Franklin and J. M. Haverty.

As will be no-ticed from this list,
three out of the seven inclu-ding the
chairman are Pitt men, which is quite
an hon-or for the University. This
com~mitt'ee has full charge of athletics
a.t th=e association.

Director Miller was also elected

Men’s Association of Wilkinsburg.

STUDENTS ARE TARDY
A‘T CONVOCATION
(Continued from Page 1)

hearty co-operation of the students
of the University in these great ~prob-
He said in part: i

A “There are two or three things that
I want to speak to the students about
this morning. ‘ In the ﬁrst I.Want to
tell the students of a motion that
Bishop Whitehead put through the
Board of Control at the last meeting
of that board. He made a motion to
the effect that there should be put in
-the minute -book of the board a reso-
lution expressing the deep apprecia-
tion of -the board for the splendid
showing the students’ made at the
Alumni banquet, held during the re-
cent celebration. He said that the
student demonstration on that night
would go ‘down in the history of the
Univer"'ty as one of its greatest
events. '

“The second thing that I want to.

call the attention of the students to is
the great amount of money it takes to
run such :1 University as we have ‘here

at the present time.

“In the old days when the Uni-
versity was in its infancy, the cost of
running the University was very
small in comparison’ to the present
annual expenses. Then the sum per
year that had to be raised outside of
the income of the University was
about $10,000, now the amount to be
raised is over $200,000. All «this goes
to show that it is very hard for the
University to increase the endowment
fund. , I

“But I am sure that the University
will sometime get the money that it
wants and needs, and more besides.
It may" not be this year, it may not
be next year-—it may not be even ﬁve
years from now, but just as surely as
the sun rises and sets, the University
of Pittsburgh will get all the money
it wants sometime. I know the peo-
ple of Pittsburgh, and I know the
people of Pittsburgh will give freely

_to the University when they ﬁnd out

‘how much the University is doing for
the ‘City of Pittsburgh".

PITT DEBATERS WIN
DOUBLE VICTORY

 

Negative Team Wins a Victory
From Allegheny at Meadvi.1l'e—
.Large Crowd Out.

 

(Continued from Page 1)

eat certain things and these things it
seemed no member of the team cared
for very much.

A cnowd of about 1,000 persons
were present at the debate and after
the debate an informal gathering was
held, at which refreshments were
served. All the members of the team
report that they had a ﬁne trip and
were very well treated by the mem-
bers of the Allegheny team and the
students of that institution. The
news of the victory of our home team
over Wooster was the ﬁnal thing that
made the team at Allegheny feel so
happy, and come home with the
“smile that won’t come off” ontheir
faces.

Prof. Fish had this to say in regard
to the results of the contests:

“I am pleased beyond words that
our teams won a double victory in
this year -of the one hundred twenty-
fifth anniversary of the University.
The men worked hard on the ques-
tion and deserved to win. The work
orffour teams was marked by the
splendid and consistent teamwork
that they displayed.

“The debate at Allegheny was
marked by four things, namely, the
size and attitude of the audience-; the
place the debate was held; the enthu-
siasm displayed in debating at Alle-
gheny; the strength of the contest.

“The audience numbered about one
thousand people. It was a gathering

worthy of the ‘best efforts -of any
speaker. Besides the students and’
faculty of Allegheny college, there

were present at the debate lawyers
businessmen, judges and pre.achers.
'1‘-he att'tude of the audience was very
helpfulto the ‘home speakers, but
~ to. =the visiting
team. At a mass meeting of the stu—_
dents, held in the morning, the stu-
dents were urged to give their utmost
‘attention to the home speakers, but
by the expression of their faces to
show how little they saw in the argu-
ments of the vistors. They did as
they were "told, which was very p.atri-
otic, but rather disconcerting for the
Pitt fellows when they got up to
speak. . n .

“The debate was held in the Ford
Memorial Chapel, a most beautiful
building with a very large seating ca-
pacity. The building was everything
that one could wish for to debate in.

“All the students of Allegheny have
the interest of the team a-t heart. A
mass meeting was
held the night before the debate, at
which speeches were made and the
captain of the team made a speech
stating what the team hoped to do
Pitt on the next day. Every student
was urged t-o be at the debate the
next night and to hel-p the boys win
a victory from Pitt. 1 .

"The debate itself, was a splendid
type of. a real intercollegiate Contest
Both teams were well preparediand

 PITT

had every phase of the subject well
in hand. The Allegheny men had
been at work on their speeches for
weeks and had a better delivery than
our men, but we ’had the arguments.
Our team work was ﬁne, and the af-‘

‘ ﬁrmative could not harm, to any grea1

ex.tent, the arguments that our mer
brought forward. No one man starred’

aside, the principle of the recall of
judges should be adopted‘_by the sev-
eral, states,” was the side defended by
the University of Pittsburgh -team
consisting =of Robt. VVetta'ch, ’l3, cap-
tain; W. B. Conrad, ’l4, and S. A.
Shepard, _’15. VVooster was» repre-
sented ~by.J. H. Baird, captain; A. G.
Zook and A. J. Townsend. ,

The judges of the debate were
Prof. Marsh, Mr.-Walker an-d Dr. Mc-
Neil.

In part the first sp-eaker‘Mr. Shep-
ard of the affirmative, said:

“The subject is politi-cal in charac-
ter. As the law now is liberty is in
the judges’ hands, and on account of
bad decisions the subject of recall
was br-ought about. It is in harmony
with the principle of government. It
is dependent on t'he will of the peo-
ple‘ if instituted. Should be made re-
sponsible to the people.”

Mr. Townsend of thenegiative said:

“None of the nations that have
courts have ever thought of the re-
call of judges. Popular recall will not
represent the people, but the majority
of the people. To secure its postiion
it must be proved that there is enough
serious evils in the system; that the
system can be changed; that it can
be maintained.” ,

Mr. Conrad said in part:

“The recall is a result of a process
that has been worked out in the his-
tory -of the country by a tremendous
amount of labor and care}?

Mr. Zook of the negativeisaidz

“The recall would reduce law to the
will of the ﬁckle majority. The ma-
jority are not always right. Why de-
stroy the power of maintaining con-
stitutionality if constitution is to be
maintained.”

M~r.'Wettach cl-osed the construc-
tive argument for Pitt with an im-
pregnable defense for the affirmative.
The negative was concluded -by the
speech of Mr. Baird. In part he said":

“The people must get control of
the primaries to overcome loss. It is
heinousness. It would lower the

-standard of the judiciary. Go-od men

would not enter the judiciary under
these conditions. Politics would be-
come the seat of the judiciary. Would
destroy the independence and fear-
lessness of the judges. If we would
have courts of justice,” he concluded
“we must bear unto the words of the
fathers:

' Wooster fought hard. and lost»  _

‘I this further
' dents will bring out many more ap-
« plicants for places.

by a small margin. In the face of
the defeat their small band of rooters
sang and cheered with the spirit of
victors, and all present heartily ap-
plauded when Dr. F. M. Thorpe said
“We are sorry for only one thing in
this victory; that you are not of us."
FACULTY GRANTS

CREDITS TO STUDENTS

 

(Continued from Page 1)

_ paper, or any other kind, amounts to

nothing. i _

As there has been keen competition
this year’ for the positions open on
the paper’s staff, it is expected that
inducement to the stu-

The granting of
credits is carefully safeguarded to
prevent any abuse of the privilege
and still to make it not too difficult.

In connection- with F the credits
granted for the newspaper men, the
debaters were also well «provided for
by the faculty. Two credits, as in the
past were given all men taking part
in any intercollegiate debate, while
the alternates were added to the list
-of credit—getters by being made eli-
gible to one cred-it. This has been
the custom in the past, but has never
been made oﬂicial by the faculty.
Now it has been placed on a sound
basis. The rules under which the
credits are granted follow below:

editor-in-chief, associate,‘ or assistant
editor, and writes articles of at least

-mined by the editor-in-chief and the in

‘COUNCIL ELEOTS CHAIRMAN.

 

(Continued from Page 1)
F. Biddle, recommended amendments

_ in line_ with the suggestions of the

Alumni Ass0ciation.at the last meet-
ing of that body. The Council after
a spirited debate in which nearly all

present took part, voted to refer the .

amendments back rtovithe committee
with instructions. In the articles
drawn to comply with the instruc-
tions of the Alumni Association meet-
ing, the nominations for ofﬁcers were
to be made by nomination blanks. The
council disapproved of this plan and
instruc-ted the committee to prepare
a plan by which all officers of coun-
cil and also members of council should
be nominated by a nominating com--
mitee and this list of nominees be
sent out to alumni for corrections or
additions before the ﬁnal election is
‘held. It was argued by those in favor
of the plan adopted by the alumni
council that it would provide for the
choice of capable me-n only, while
guarding against government of this
body by any one group of men.

A number of new members were
proposed and elected‘ to membership
in the Alumni Association. R. C. Mc-
Kenna, chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee for the past year, gave a very
full report for the year’s work, in
which he -outlined the work accom—
plished by that committee. A vote of
thanks was tendered the committee
for its efiicient work during the last
year. The question concerning the
mailing of the Pitrt Weekly to unaf-
ﬁliated alumni, raised by Mr. Scovel

at the meeting of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, and referred to the Alumni
Council, was postponed on report of
the Pitt Weekly.

The part which the Alumni are to
play in the campaign about to start
for the endowment fund was referrecl
to the finance committee with instruc-
tions to aid the trustees in every way
possible. Reportsifrom the various
standingconimittees were received
and approved.
