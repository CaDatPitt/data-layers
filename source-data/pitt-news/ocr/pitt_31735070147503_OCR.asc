Celebrating the legacy  

Members of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity came together to remember Martin Luther King Jr.

john Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

The frigidjanuary wind did its best
to put out the 50 or so candles car-
ried by members of the Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity and others last
night as they marched down Forbes
Avenue sidewalks still patched with
snow. -

Gusts whipped along the large-
ly deserted streets drowning out
the marchers’ singing, but for all
mother nature’s efforts, the small
points of light remained. Frater-
nity members hopedthe ﬂames
—- shielded by gloved hands and
hunched shoulders —- might be a
ﬁtting remembrance for Martin Lu~
ther King_]r., a man who refused to
allow the momentum of the civil
rights movement to be put out in
his own time.

The historically black fraternity
dedicated to service and broth-
erhood sought to carry King’s

memory, and after a short march,

- continued to discuss the issues fac-

ing today’s black community. The
vigil and discussion formed a part
of several events on Pitt’s campus
this week to commemorate King’s
legacy. - -

The group gathered ﬁrst on the
snow—capped steps of the Cathe-
dral of Learning, mostly dressed in
smooth, silk ties and starched col-
lared shirts or other formal wear —
whites and blacks, men and women.
Alpha Phi Alpha president Isaac
Connor thanked the small but di-
verse crowd for braving the cold.

“We’re here today to remember
the legacy of Martin Luther King
Jr.,’’ Connor began, lighting the ﬁrst
candle and passing the ﬂame from
wick to wick. “I know everyone’s

cold, but we have an important .

duty in remembering and honor-

" ing him.”

After a brief moment of silence
and some autobiographical re-
marks, Connor and the Alpha Phi

Alpha brothers led the procession
west along Forbes Avenue. As some
marchers’ candles went out, oth-

ers quickly leaned in to rekindle
them, passing the ﬂame back and ‘

forth so that the original light still
remained when the group reached
David Lawrence Hall.

Once inside the building, Al-

pha Phi Alpha member Kene Uke-
je moderateda group debate and
discussion on the ideology and
teachings of King and other black
cultural leaders, particularly those
of Booker T. Washington and W.E.B.
DuBois. ‘ ‘ ' '

The conversation focused on two
of the principle troubles still facing
the black community in‘America
today: a lack of health care and busi-
ness ownership.

Ukeje cited statistics that seemed
to surprise ‘many of those in atten-
dance. For instance, he reported
that black people constitute almost
40 percent of new AIDS cases re-
ported annually in the U.S., while

representing just 13 percent of the
country’s population.

The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reports similar sta-

tistics on its website. At the end of e

2007, black people accounted for
46 percent of people living with a
diagnosis of HIV infection in the 37

states with “long—term, conﬁden-

tial, name-based HIV reporting.”

. Ukeje opened the ﬂoor for dis-
cussion about this topic and others,
including the under—representation
of black Americans in small and

large business ownership. Alpha-

Phi Alpha brothers and others
proposed numerous explanations

' and potential solutions to these

disparities. _
“Too many of our people live
in poor, densely populated urban
communities with no access to
health care and no sexual educa-
tion. It’s not really surprising to
hear these facts.
“It’s ’cause we don’t vote. We
don’t get our voice out there, and

Small
fire in
Sutherland

Michael Macagnone

News Editor-

. A small ﬁre in a trash room brought
the cityﬁre department to Sutherland
Hall early Monday morning and sent
residents out into the chilly air for al-
most an hour.

The sprinkler system quickly extin-
guished the ﬁre on the eighthﬂoor. One
stairwell had extensive water damage
and morethanadozen rooms suffered
water damage of some kind across sev-
eral ﬂoors. A representative from the

- city ﬁre department said there were

no injuries.
Water was visible on the carpet of
the building’sﬁfthﬂoor after residents

. were allowed back in.

The alarm went off just afterz a.m.
insutherland Hall East, whichwas then
evacuated. Several units from the Pitt
police, city ﬁre department and city
police responded.

After a few minutes, one engine
remained at Sutherland while most of
the ﬁrst responders left. .

Residents were allowed back into
the building about ﬁve minutes before

we don’t get the help we need.

“Even when our brothers and
sisters graduate from medical
school,” he said, “they can’t help
out our poor communities because
they have to pay off their student
loans. They can’t work for free.”

‘ Gradually it became clear in the
conversation that, like King and
other big players in the civil rights
movement, many in theblack com-
munity at Pitt see teamwork and
communication as paramount in
solving the racial issues that still
cause suffering and-hardship, even
in a nation with a black president.

In closing, Connor called for
those in the audience to display the
same courage King once did.

“As a people I think we are afraid
of failure. Our community is full of
great ideas and great minds, but too
many of usgtake the easy way out,
saying we don’t have‘ the resources,”
he said. “We can’t solve our prob-
lems if we don’t put ourselves out
there and try.” I ‘

Opinions

What’s

f “What’s your sign, baby?”‘
Iis your normal pick up line,

you might want to replace
it with -something else. The re-
sponse might be anger about the

- supposed shift in zodiac signs,

especially if a tattoo is involved..

We’re sure you noticed the ex-
plosion from news outlets, if not
from social media sites, with a
list of updated zodiac signs —
including a new sign called Ophi-
uchus. .

Social networkers, including
a noticeable, number of Pitt stu-
dents, were observed mourning

and some refused to acknowledge
the change.

According, to The Boston »

Globe, the identity crisis of “I’m
a Pisces? All this time I thought
I was an Aries!” started when as-
tronomer Parke Kunkle told the
StarTribune in Minnesota that
the moon’s gravitational pull has
caused the calendar constellations
to be off by about a month.

But now, before Cosmopoli-

tan even had a chance to update ‘

its horoscopes, most astrologers

are saying that the signs haven’t

changed at all.

Cambridge, Mass., astrolo-
ger Joyce Levine told the Boston
Globe, “The precession of the
equinoxes does not affect Tropi-
cal Astrology, which is primar-
ily what we use in the Western
culture. Tropical Astrology is

based on the seasons: Aries, the

beginning of spring; Cancer, the

beginning of summer; Libra, the V

beginning of fall, and Capricorn,
the beginning of winter.”

An article in the Examiner
went as far as to suggest that pub-
lications that printed “the bogus

list of new signs should print cor-

rections.” ~ -
But more important to us than

whether or not the signs have

changed is why people care so ‘

much.

Though most are quick to dis-
miss their astrological signs and
the fortune—telling horoscopes
that correspond, the reaction to
a possible constellation shift_was
extremely widespread.

You might have your zodiac

sign tramp-stamped on your.
A back, ‘we’re looking at the char-

acteristics attributed to the dif-

ferent signs and thinking the
descriptive adjectives are pretty
generic. According to astrology-
online.com, a Taurus’ traits in-
clude being jealous, determined
and warmhearted. Yeah  that

’ u could be anyone.

Should we really be buying
into what seems about as reliable

"as a fortune cookie?

And as far as the identity crisis
that has erupted from the sup-
posed astrological shift, we’re
doubting that your sign actually
accurately "predicts whether or
not you’re a bitch. Sorry. I

A MIDWESTERN I$|EcI-:

Impacts of Civil War arestill felttoday

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

One hundred and ﬁfty years ago,
the United States entered the
most perilous ﬁve years of its
entire existence. South Carolina
secededfrom the Union on Thurs-
day, Dec. 20, 1860, with six other
states following in short order.
The situation deteriorated and on
April 12, 1861, the opening guns
of the U.S. Civil War were ﬁred in
Charleston, S.C.

The importance of the war to
the era can hardly be exaggerated.
Dr. Van Beck Hall of Pitt’s history
department made this very clear.
More than 600,000 Americans
died, roughly 2 percent of the
entire population of the nation
at that time. A comparable war
today would have 6.2 million
deaths. In three days, a single
battle, Gettysburg, claimed more
lives than the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan combined. As a per-
cent of the American population,
a comparable battle today would
leave 70,000 ‘dead. The largest
modern misconception of the Civ-
il War, according to Hall, was that
it was somehow romantic “with
the fancy uniforms and beautiful
women  [when] it really was the
Battle of the Somme.”

In this multi-part series I aim
to examine the war in‘three_ ma-
jor areas: its impacts, its causes
and its battles. This cannot be
comprehensive.After all, it took
Shelby Foote 16 years and three
volumes. to tell his version of the
war, and James M. McPherson
909 pages in one volume, “Battle
Cry of Freedom: The Civil War
Era.” Sb, three columns is a little
light by comparison. But I do the
best I can.

Why should the war still be

relevant to us today, these 150, _

years later? Largely because the
impacts of the war were wide-
spread enough that they still
affect us in the 21st century. Ac-

cording to Hall, perhaps-the most '

enduring impact was a redeﬁning
of the role of the federal govern-
ment. The ﬁrst income tax and
a forerunner to the IRS were set
up tofund the war. The govern-
ment was also heavily involved‘
in subsidizing railroads and also
dramatically expanded the reach
and scope of the mail service. Civil
War pensions were also an early
example of a government—funded
social program. I also note that
the right of habeas corpus was

suspended by the Lincoln admin— .

istration, giving the president the
power to detain people on a scale
that makes our modern debate
over detention of terrorists seem

trivial.

The Civil War changedlhow we ,
‘thought of ourselves. Foote said

that before the war, people said
“the United States are” whereas
afterward they said “the United
States IS.” “And that sums up what
the war accomplished. It made
us an ‘is.”’ Before the Civil War,

some states asserted their rights .

to nullify the will of the federal
government. After the war, this
didn’t happen. Once the’fed-
eral government ﬁnally acted

veryreal possibility because 5‘all

they have to do is make the United I

States go away.” I enjoy mulling
over sometimes trivial things that
changed the course of history.
What if Gouverneur K. War-
ren hadn’t rushed troops to
Little Round Top at Gettysburg?

I The South might have won the
battle and changed the course of ‘
‘the war. What if some careless

courier ‘hadn’t dropped Robert
E. Lee’s Special Order No. 191
in a Maryland ﬁeld, orders that

legacy that are still with us today

monuments.

against segregation, Southern
states didn’t pass nulliﬁcation
ordinances. After the president
ordered him to stop blocking that

schoolhouse door, George Wallace _

sullenly did so.
Another measure of the im-
pacts that the Civil War has had on

us today isjust how different our '

history would have been had the
war gone differently. And it could
have. Hall notes that a Confeder-
ate victory in the Civil War was a

in many more Ways than juststone

changed the Antietam campaign

when they were found by Union '

troops? What ifJohn Wilkes Booth
had twitched his hand, sending
the ball that killed Lincoln a few
inches too wide? T

We cannot forget the most im-
portant change of all, the aboli-
tion of slavery. This shook society
and the economy to their roots to
a degree many don’t really com-
prehend. Hall estimates that up to
a quarter of all wealth in the Unit-

ed States before the warwas mea-

sured in slaves, and that the best '

investment’ a plantation owner
could make was buying more land

. and more lives. Unfortunately, he

notes that the slaves were largely
cut loose without any particular
planning or thought, and the
struggle to ﬁnd answers to the

persistent questions of what to

do about former slaves was part
of the reason Reconstruction was
so messy. It was alsoincomplete
— the goals of some radical Re-
publicans regarding the rights of
freedmen wouldn’t be realized for
another hundred years.

Long -after Confederate bat-
tle ﬂags were handed" to fed-
eral troops at_ Appomattox, Va.,
Bentonville, .N.C., and countless
other places around the re-United
States, the Civil War had left dif-
ﬁculties and a legacy that are still
with us today in many more ways
than just stone monuments and
halls of the "Grand Army of the
Republic. -

I would like to thank Hall for
two very informative interviews.
To learn more about the Civil War,
he recommends James McPher-
son andJ_ames K. Hogue’s “Ordeal
by Fire: The Civil War and Recon-

_struction.”

I The Pitt men’s basketball team

couldn’t have asked for a better

A start to its top -ﬁve matchup against

Syracuse Monday night.

But it wasn’t the beginning of
the game that sealed the win for the
Panthers —,it was their play in the
end that allowed them to come away
with a74-66 win over No. 3 Syracuse‘
at the Petersen Events Center. S

Pitt started the game on a 19-0
run in the ﬁrst. eight minutes, but.
a 17-0 run by the Orange (18-1, 5-1
Big East) cut the lead to 19-17 to
essentially negate the Panthers’
hot start. '

But ahead by just four points M

with 7:39 left to play, the Panthers
went on another run — this time
it was a 10-2 stretch over the next
two minutes to push the score to

* 65-53, all but putting the" game out

of Syracuse’s reach.
“It was probably the ﬁrst time

in my career we ever got out to a

start likethat,” Pitt senior guard
Brad Wanamaker said in a post-
game news conference. “That’s

"What basketball is, a game of i-(ms;  

We made our ﬁrst run. They made
theirs.” ’
“We just did not do anything
well in the beginning,” Syracuse,
head coachjim Boeheim said. “We
regrouped and I thought we played
really well the rest of the ﬁrst half
once we got over that start and
made as good a comeback as you’re

V going to make.”

Junior forward Nasir Robinson

' led~No. 4 Pitt with 21 points, nine of

which came in the ﬁrst three min-

utes of the game.

“I was relaxed. My teammates
found me, and I just ﬁnished the
plays,” Robinson said. “Once Igot a
good rhythm, I just kept rol1ing.”

Syracuse played without its lead-
ing scorer, Krisjoseph, who missed
the game with a head injury. C.J. Fair
led the team with 16 points, and
Scoop Jardine chipped in with 12.

“You just have to play withiwhat
you have. Injuries happen,” Boe-
heim said.‘ ‘-‘Obviously he’s abig
part of our team, and we certainly

missed him tonigh .”

. Center Rick Jackson led the
Orange in rebounds with 11, also
scoring 10 points. ,

The, Orange got close several
times but could never quite over-
come its early deﬁcit to take the
lead and ended up with its ﬁrst loss
of the season.

Syracuse cut the lead to 28-27
before an Ashton Gibbs 3—pointer
made it 31-27 right before the half-
time buzzer. The Orange tied the
game at 41 on ajames Southerland
three with just under 14 minutes
left.

But Pitt guard Travon Woodall
responded with a quick 3—pointer
to take the lead back. For the Pan-
thers, their resiliency allowed them
to withstand the Orange’s come-
back attempts. .

“I think that’s just one of the
most importantfthings about this
team, through adversity and hard
times, we really just stick together
and push through,” senior forward
Gil Brown said.

The win marks the ﬁfth—straight
game that the Panthers have de-
feated Syracuse and their vaunted
2-3 zone. Wanamaker said that’s due
in largep‘artto't'he"‘teafn’s ability" to
score against that kind of defense.

“It’s just us attackingtheir zone,”
Wanamaker said. “We always have
somebody down low that can make
plays for other people. Nasir and
Gary (McGhee) were the culprit
of doing that today.” ‘

Pitt set a new Petersen Events
Center attendance record with
12,925 fans, and according to the
Panthers, they’re a big part of the
team’s success.

“It was crazy. When we made
that ﬁrst run, that’s probably the
loudest the Pete has ever been
since I’ve been here,” Brown said.

- “They were truly our sixth man. I

think having a crowd like the Zoo
really helps us out a lot and is the
reason why we’re so tough to play
at home.” V

For Boeheim, who’s been coach-
ing at Syracuse for 35 years, this
Panthers team ranks up with the
best in his tenure.

V ’ ‘This is as good of a-Pitt team-as -
I’ve seen,” he said. I

ing “311.”

Guillermo Cole, public infor-
mation ofﬁcer for the Allegheny
County Health Department, em-

’ phas_ized that -before reaching for

the phone, student tenants should
ﬁrst take any concerns to their

- landlords.

“The ﬁrst thing we’re going to

tion, the department rules the
problem as either urgent or
non—urgent, Cole said. An urgent
problem, such as no heating or
a carbon monoxide leak, would

prompt immediate inspection by '

the department.
A rusty ﬁre escape would be a

‘legitimate reason to call, while a

the landlords are not

doing anything about, dorftwait Several ‘
Weeks before calling us.

the department doesn’t do annual
inspections of every rented prop-
erty because that would require
a large amount of manpower. It
primarily relies on tenants to call
with concerns.

If student tenants believe
their rented property is not up
to building safety codes, they can

contact the city helpline byc_all- A

ask is, ‘Have you reported this
to your landlord or not?”’ Cole
said. Still, tenants shouldn’t hesi-
tate to call given an unresponsive
landlord.“ ‘ '
“If it’s a problem that the

landlords are not doing anything‘

about, don’t wait several weeks
before calling usj’ he said.

Based on a tenant’s descrip-'

leaky faucet or a missing shower
curtain would not be, Cole said. If
inspectors ﬁnd a safety infringe-
ment, the bureau can issue a no-
tice of violation to a landlord giv-
ing the landlord a period of time
to repair the problem.

Other common safety con-
cerns includea building’s number

of exits, smoke detectors and ﬁre

extinguishers. Conditions such
as structural problems, broken
furnaces or other utility issues
can be brought to the attention
of the Allegheny County Health
Department.

Should a landlordnot address

a problem‘ after a warning and the '0

allotted time for repairs, the de-

A' partment will come out to inspect

the complaint. An unresponsive
landlord could be brought to court
and ﬁned and could receive a lien
on his property, Cole said. He also
mentioned that, if the problem
persists after the designated pe-
riod, a landlord can be brought
to court and ﬁned up to $1,000
each day the problem remains
unﬁxed. P’ V ’

For non-urgent matters, the

department notiﬁes a landlord
that it has received a complaint
from a -tenant and provides a
deadline for the landlord to cor-
rect the problem. The time frame
depends on the circumstances,
although the-landlord can receive

up to 30 days for some issues.

Tenants can also take matters

Students seek out new roommates on the Internet

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staff Writer

Normally, if a.person went into her kitchen
to see a stranger sitting at the counter, she

would scream and call the police.

But for some students, the procedure is
just to yawn and say, “Would you pass the
Cheerios?” A ‘ '

When there are more rooms than room-
mates, some students look to the Internet to

ﬁnd a tenant — a practice that often leads ‘

to sharing a residence ‘with a stranger. As
they become a more popular resource for
job listings, shopping and other sergvices,
websites like Craigslist.com are also be-
coming hubs for Pitt students searching

, for roommates.

Craigslist is a network of online social
communities, including free online classiﬁed

advertisements. One section is devoted to L

housing, and includes listings for houses,
apartments and sublets available for rent.
Another section allows prospectiverenters
to list what they’re looking for in their next
residence. ‘ .

Pitt graduate student Erin‘Palumbo has
used Craigslist on numerous occasions to
ﬁnd a place to live or ﬁnd roommates to ﬁll

an extra bedroom.

Although the "website has helped her
ﬁll those rooms, the process was often a
strange one. . l '

‘When moving from Rochester, N .Y., to
Pittsburgh, Palumbo posted an advertise-
ment on Craigslist looking for a place to
live. One of the responses she received was
from a grandfather who insisted that her

Erin Palumbo: .

mate. ‘
“It’s always a bitawkward bringing
strangers in to live with because you don’t
know if it’s my territory or your territory,’f
Palumbo said. “But I think it’s actually
worked out very well for me.” ’

She advises students to be complete-
ly honest with ‘themselves and potential ,
roommates and to consider whether. life- »

mother call him to discuss her living with
him. She said that she also received e-mails
from other men who said she could live with
them if she cooked and cleaned.

' She got an e-mail that said,.“If you can’t
follow instructions, and respect mom, you
can not live here as a princess.’.’ _ . '

Ignoring those e-mails, however, Palum-
bo eventually found someone to live with,
and the person is currently still her room-

tries to avoid living with people with 9—to-

selves.”

Pitt sophomores Brenna Sweetman and
Paula Nociolo created a Craigslist advertise-
ment when Sweetman found out she would
be studying abroad this coming fall.

“Since I was studying abroad in the fall
and my roommate said that she was pretty
much open to living with anyone, we thought
that Craigslist would be a good idea,” Sweet-
man said. “And we’ve been growing kind of
desperate.” ' -

The two are keeping the opportunity open
to friends who haven’t ﬁgured out housing
yet, but plan to meet with everyone who
responds to the advertisement.Sweetman
said that all of the -responses the two had re-
ceived so far were from people who seemed
normal. ‘ ’ '

Nociolo advised Craigslist users to make
their posting as speciﬁc as possible. Sweet-
man will only goabroad for a semester, so
the two studentsonlylneed someone to live
in the’ apartment for a few months. They
ended up going back and revising their ad-
vertisement when people started saying they
were looking for living arrangements for
longer periods "of time. '

“I deﬁnitely think that Craigslist isa good i

said.‘ “It’s really easy and all you really need

. SOME UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

 

Isa crowbar necessary for S

. One columnist braves living across the Boulevard to cut costs

Jacob Brown
Columnist

 

Popular lore would have you believe liv-
ing in South Oakland, let alone across the
Boulevard of the Allies, is about as safe as
living in South Compton. A North Oakland
landlord all but told me that when I toured
his apartment complex some years ago.
But I’ve spent three years living on the

' more boisterous southern side of Forbes

Avenue without much trouble at all. The
worst thing I have experienced. in South
Oakland occurred when a drunkard tried
to break into my apartment after mistak-
ing it for his friends’.

And another time, a few idiots tried
to flip my car after the Penguins won the
Stanley Cup injune 2009. Fancily enough,
I discovered that walking out of your apart-

. ment with a large iron crowbar and asking

them nicely to walk away goes a long way
toward getting those people to stop.

My apartment situation this year drew a
little more fear from me than in years past,
though. With my old roommate graduat-

ing last year, I set out to ﬁnda new, cheap
place to live. That place just happened to -
' be located across the Boulevard.

Regarding living across the Boulevard,
you never hear anything positive. .

Case in point: Months before I would
move to my current abode, a woman shot
herself during a conﬂict with her boy-
friend in a house right across the street

’ ' from where I live. I questioned whether‘

I should try to get out of my lease at-that
point. i V

But after living across the Boulevard
now for almost five months, I have to

A admitgthat it’s been the quietest, safest— ,
feeling place I’ve lived in since moving »
. out of the eerily quiet Lothrop Hall after

sophomore year.

Living across the Boulevard isn’t per-
fect, though. To start things off, it’s not
exactly the place you live at if you’re the
kind of person who usually le_aves a ﬁve-
minute window to get to class. Getting to
class often involves playing Frogger across
the street without a crosswalk. .

And if houses on Atwood and Semp
are considered rat holes, property values
show that housing complexes across the
Boulevard are significantlyless, signify-
ing their desirability. Other rumors that
propagate throughoutthe “dirtier” South
Oakland concern drugs, crime and various
dribbles of delinquency.

Empirical evidence from my ﬁve-month
stint across the Boulevard shows none of
the latter, and I’m too afraid to go too far
down Dawson orjuliet at night to see if the
former hold any weight. Dan Marina and
Andy Warhol might have grown up back

Maybe I’m a victim of the neighbor-

mind to the stories I’ve heard. It should
be noted that I live just two blocks into my
street from the Boulevard of the Allies.

Should you leave

Oakland?

Lexie Bond
. Columnist

 

Picking up and moving every year is about as

‘fun as realizing you need to go up a jean size.

This summer I was lucky enough to move during
a heat advisory. Bonds are notorious for their.
active sweat glands, in case you didn’t know.

- But I suppose you didn’t really need to know
that, unless you want to opt out of the treadmill

"beside me at the gym from now on.

Despite moving beinga pain in my one-jean-
size-larger and sweaty rear, I was a bit more
excited this year at the prospect of moving to
a new neighborhood — Squirrel Hill. ' '

Now why would someone that goes to school
in Oakland want to live in Squirrel Hill? If you
must know, I’m quite fond of squirrels. Well,
squirrels and Razzy Fresh frozen yogurt,
which didn’t exist in Oakland at the time of
my move. ,

Squirrel Hill had’ some great perks at ﬁrst.
My apartmentwas a great size, had big closets

I avoid the ﬂu, avoid the people who cough and '

sneeze throughout their entire ride on public
transportation. ’

But my negative experience with the Port
Authority doesn’t end with my new and nec-
essary addiction to orange juice and NyQuil
cocktails. No. Riding the bus has also given
me a really big ego. I’ve learned that I’m highly

attractive by public transportation standards, ‘

by the number of old men that either 1) tell me
I have a nice face 2) tell me I can sit on their
knee when no other seats are available 3) “ac-
cidently” repeatedly rub their man parts on
my shoulder while I’m sitting and 4) bite me.

. Yes. I’ve been bitten by another human being

on the Port Authority. And no. I don’t want to
talk about it.

Of course my gripes about riding the bus
would not be unique to Squirrel Hill, but not
having to ride the bus is a great reason in- itself
for Pitt Students to stay in the.Oakland area.

In addition, another beneﬁt to staying in
Oakland is having other students as your neigh-
bors. My neighbors include two infants in the

I Yes. l’ve been ‘bitten by another

human being on the Port Authority.  
And no. I don’t Want to talk about it.

and hardwood ﬂoors. The parking outside 

. building was free — no permit required. My

rent was about the same as my old place in

’ South Oakland, butlwasgetting so much more

for my money.

  To add. Ieveri thought at 999 point

ifI lived in Squirrel iiiu"1dn§eiidugh, 1 might
becomeJewish.. B
So distracted by the abundance of squirrels

outside my front door and the abundance of
frozen yogurt in my belly, I didn’t notice the
drawbacks of the neighborhood until pretty

‘ recently. —

Iused to enjoy my15 minutewalkto campus
last year from my old place in South_ Oakland.
I’d get to rock out to Hanson on my iPod and
squeeze in a little workout every time I walked
to and from class. . I

But now it would take me an hour to walk

I to campus and would involve crawling up some

very large hills. Who would have thought Squir-
rel Hill would have so many hills? Apparently
not the person who assumed squirrels would
be more abundant. , .

Because campus isn’t a reasonable Walking
distance from my apartment, I’mforced to take
the Port Authority buses. I’ve also noticed that

—I4get sick -pretty much everyiother day now.‘ »
Coincidence? I thinknot. If you’re looking to «

apartment directly above me that run around

and cry all day —— that is when they’re not bang-
ing on the Xylophone they got for Christmas.
Their parents also like to vacuum constantly

and coughup disturbing amounts of phlegm ’
;at1a.m;_”M_‘_g____5,,”   . _.  .. 

Another disadvantage to living in_a. non-
student neighborhood is the slim chance that
you’ll make new friends in your imrnigrant—ﬁlled
apartment building. And if you think your old

friends will be willing to travel to visit you, you .

better make_something good for dinner. Forget
about having parties unless all your guests can

. stay the night when they’re too drunk to drive

home. , .
Although there surely are nicer and less
expensive rentals in Squirrel Hill, there are
deﬁnitely disadvantages to leavingthe Oakland
area. My advice to you, reader, as I hold your
face in my hands and shake it, is to stay here.
Stay as long as you .can! After all, you don’t
need an extra couple of miles between you and

your perfect attendance award. Do they give ,

perfect attendance awards in college? Well,
they should. .

Making the best of
a college bedroom

In college, interior design requires ingenuity, taste

Jordan Streussnig
Staff Writer

Four white walls can bepretty daunting,
but it doesn’t have to be that way.

Take it from junior studio arts major
Emily Priestas, who ﬁnds her own cre-
ative ways to add a touch of pizazz to her
space. ‘ V -

“I love adding apersonal touch to my
room with photographs. I often ﬁnd cheap
picture frames and paint them a bright
color, then use ribbons to hang them from
the wall,” Priestas said.

Kymberly Pelcher, the woman behind
Kymberly Pelcher Interiors of Pittsburgh,

‘ also highly recommends photographs as

a great, simple decoration for college
students.
“Photographs are an important thing,

Kymberly Pelcher:

for people to write on,” which could be a
low—cost, ‘easy way to add some fun and
personality to your décor. j
Beyond the paper; there’s still one
source of confusion that many beginners

find difficult to remedy: color.

Priestas suggested keeping. things
simple. _ I
“Adding too many patterns and colors

' can be overwhelming, but doing some-mix-

ing and matching can be fun because ital-

lows for many combinations,” she said.
Of course, aesthetics must be‘accom-

panied by sound organization. This can

be particularly important to those stu- V
dents dealing with stringent space limi-
« tations. . »

Nikki Nair, a senior majoring in phys-
ics and math, described the challenge of
living in a space-efﬁcient room: “I have

no closet, and my room "is about 6 feet by.

"Make sure‘ everything is out o.f sight’

Whcndyou go to sleep — computer .
close and papers put away. _  

especially in a dorm room when youire
away from your family. Go buy a few cheap
frames in different sizes, but keep them
in the same ﬁnish. Thenhang them ran!
domly on the wall. Even if you have a lot

"of different pictures, which tend to look

very unrelated, because you have the same
ﬁnish they will look‘-terriﬁc and cohesive,”
Pelcher said. ' ' ' .
Even if you opt to go frameless, pictures
can still be a focus in your bedroom. Try
aphoto collage on an area such_ as your
bedroom door. Don’t have a lot ofpictures

' laying around? Try making a collage with ‘ '

images from magazines instead.
Priestas also recommended picking

up some contact paper —- the adhesive

material with a design on. one side that

' many people have traditionally used to

line cabinets and drawers —- and maybe

cutting an interesting pattern into it be-___

fore hanging. - ‘
According to ehow.co_m, it doesn’t have
to be limited to that: Contact paper can be

i - used for all sorts of,other purposes, like CD

case or notebook covers, and can_typically
be purchased for about $5 per roll.
. ‘Priestas went on to suggest that con-

- tact paper can be used ‘‘like a whiteboard

7 or 8 feet. I can’t ever just drop clothes

r on the floor.”

Without a closet, Nair must make do
in other ways. "

“I put a bunch of nails in the walls and
hang clothes off them.‘I stack a bunchof
stuff - I have a bookshelf on top of my
desk,’»’ he said. I

Pelcher said that being selective and ‘

efﬁcient are crucial in a small space, and

color becomes all the more important.
“I would say to pick one color you love,

or maybe two, and go with a lot of different

shades of the same color. Small rooms tend -

to look very cluttered, and if you use dif-

ferent shades of the same color, that will ‘

cut down on clutter greatly. If you wanted
to do patterns, make sure to keep them in

' the same color family.”
Another word of advice from Pelcher, A

‘an adherent of feng shui, is to never go to
sleep in a mess. ~

“Because you sleep in‘ the same place A

that you'do your work, you always want to

keep your bed a very restful place. Make '
sure everything is out of sight when you '

go to sleep — computer closed and papers

* put away. Keeping things out of sight.is

key.” ‘

come equipped with when you get your
ﬁrst place. Calling your landlord over a
leaking fridge is logical; calling for a loose
screw is ridiculous.

Oftentimes, tools and skills go hand-in-
hand. Below,,I’ve listed a few prominent
examples. — . , ’

Screwdrivers and drills: I cannot ad-
equately express how important screw-
drivers and screwdriver know—how are.

Often, they’re the difference between an '

easy job and looking like a chimpanzee
trying to crack a safe. .

There are two heads that I’d recom-
mend having. A Phillips—head — one
that has a tip shaped a bit like an “x” and
comes to a point — and a standard tip
screwdriver — one that has a ﬂat head
that’s longer. One way to get both in one

tool is an offset screwdriver — often “s”~ 4

shaped, it has two heads and is useful in
tight spaces. IKEA furniture often requires
this kind of screwdriver for assembly.

You’ll want both and, if you have the

option, perhaps differentsizes. My own
hammer unscrews into two of each, which
is plenty for basic home maintenance.

' If you plan on buying furniture that
might require assembly, an electric drill
could be handy. Though they’re fairly easy

‘ to use,I’d advise you be somewhat familiar

with them or work with someone who is
—— power tools are, well, powerful.

Plungers: There’s a distinct kind of H

embarrassment that ‘comes with clogging
a toilet. And if you and your roommates
have one bathroom, it can be awkward and
inconvenient too. Fortunately, unclogging
atoilet.is pretty simple.

First —— after allowing some time to

pass, to let whatever is clogging the toilet g

degrade — start by draining any excess
water so you don’_t risk splashing. There

are two simple steps that thisoldhousea

com recommends do-it—yourself handy-
men follow.‘ .

Press the plunger into the toilet slowly,
covering the hole and achieving a strong
seal. - -
Pull up quickly. to draw up whatever is
blocking the toilet. ' V

If this doesn’t work, you might con-
sider either using drain Cleaner or calling a»

much like a drain snake but has rubber to

protect toilet porcelain. Don’t try using a

Sarah Simkin

I A lot goes into crafting the ideal living

situation: landlord, location, roommates,
reasonable rent and utilities. But as your
food columnist, I know of one room that
deserves extra attention: the kitchen.
Even if cooking isn’t your thing, you
can’t pretend you won’t ‘need to eat. And
by the time you move off campus, you

plans. So, in brief, here are few things. to
watch out for while apartment scouting
and house hunting: '

What is the counter space like?

Your counter space is where!you’ll do
-the vast majority of your food prepara-

tion. Again, I’r_n not talking about having “

room to do anything tricky with compli-
cated preparations, but will you have a
place to put your bowl down while mixing
powdered soup into it? Are you dexterous
enough toaccomplish that and other simi-
lar tasks in midair? Probably. not. i

‘ Counters are also where all your
kitchen gadgets will go. Even the bare
basics — microwave, toaster, coffee maker
— consume space. And there are blend-
ers, toaster ovens, stand mixers, electric
kettles, rice cookers, crock pots  you get

where I’m going with this. Think about V 

what'you’ll want to have constant easy

access to and how much space_you’ll need . - 1: '

to achieve that. »

How large is the pantry and.how
much storage is there?

This isn’t necessarily a deal breaker,
but a lack of a pantry might require some
‘creativity. My roommates and I felt we
needed a pantry more than a linen closet,
and the difference between those two is

‘ really only a matter of state of mind if you

Alternatives to  
working out at the gym

Working out from home another good way to stay ﬁt

Ohad Cadji [Assistant Visual Editor

The Panther CrossFit club works out in front of a member’s house on Coltart Avenue.

Isaac Saul
Staj_1" Writer

Getting off the couch and to the- gym is
hard enough when it’s nice outside, but
by the time winter rolls around, it’s nearly
impossible to get motivated for that walk
to the Petersen Events Center or any other
gym on campus. ‘

The excuses are endless, and Pitt soph-
omore Mike DeAngelis, an avid gym user,
can come up with more than one reason
to stay at home. ‘ ’

“Cold weather, having to walk up that
hill, or just a long night the day before,”
DeAngelis said. ‘ p - ‘

So, once you make the decision to stay
in, you need to ﬁnd a way to workout at
home. People"all have different routines,
but DeAngelis keeps it pretty basic.

“Lots of push—ups, pull—ups and crunch-
es,” DeAngelis said. “Our roommate Chris
has a door—jamb pull-up bar, so I use that
sometimes too.”

To keep up with their workouts, many
students are resorting to in-home activi-
ties. For this reason, at—home work-outs
such as Bowﬂex, P90X and the Insanity

Workout are all more popular than ever.
Surprisingly, getting a good workout at
home isn’t as difﬁcult as you mightthink.

, With some ‘cheap purchases, you can be

right on your way.

Door-jamb Pull-Up Bar — A pull—up
‘bar can cost anywhere from $20 to $80,
but they’re all relatively the same quality.
Most bars have a 300—pound weight limit
and can be installed into any door jamb.
Once the doofjafnb is installed, you can
get a few good workouts in: l '

—Pull-ups: Pull-ups’ are perhaps the
toughest workout you can do. With the

down, and then pull yourself back up. This
workout is great for forearms, core and
shoulders..Once an expert, you can try

' to do one-handed pull—ups. This is when

you take your off hand and grip your own
wrist on the hand holding the bar, while
using one arm to pull yourself up.

logic that pull—ups do, only you have your

Off- campus security an
issue at some universities

Institutions have less protection for students off—campus

Nick Clunn
The Record (MCT)

HACKENSACK, N. J. —‘The key cards and
security guards that provide a layer of
protection on college campuses might as
well be a world away when a student steps
beyond the front gates.

Within several blocks, students might
see a campus police officer on patrol and
the familiar faces of their peers. Expand
the radius, however, and the occasional
shuttle bus might be the only sign of a
nearby college. The call boxes and other
safeguards installed on. campus — and
often stressed to prospective students
and their parents during tours — can’t

Pelcher said there are many ways to keep things
out of sight. She suggested using decorative
boxes and bins and colored folders to add style
and function to a desk area. She also recom-

V Nair said that being organized is “the only
way to deal with living in a small space.”
“I’m naturally kind of a packrat. When I
ﬁrst moved in, I ended up getting rid of a lot

_ of stuff,” he said. 4

Evenin such a small space, though, putting
up at least a few decorations can liven up your

I

room and make it feel like home.

“I do have space for decorations,” Nair said,
“butI decorate functionally — all of my decora-
tions have a purpose.”-~ , ii‘

Nair said that, for example, he has a ﬂag
hung over his window, serving the dual purpose
of decoration and keeping light out at night.

Learning to live well in a small space is un-
doubtedly tricky for most, but it is not always
without reward. ‘

“It’s actually been nice. It’s helped me a lot
in being more organized and it helps me to
be more efﬁcient,” Nair said. “If someone has
trouble with organization, it just means they’re

not doing it, because it’s not really that hard.” I

months of work, you could also give the
one-handed chin—up your best shot.
—]umping Pull/Chin—ups: This is a bit
more advanced, but some athletes use the
jumping pull/chin-ups to simultaneously
work cardio, calves, core, and upper body.
The idea is simple:a]ump into your pull/
chin—up and after getting your chin over

0 the bar, extend back to your start position-

and let your feet touch the ground -only to
jump again (letting go of the bar). This
is a good way to end either a pu1l—up or
chin—up workout because it is easier on
your arms and core but gives you a good
cardio and calf workout.

Elastic Bands: The quality and intri-
cacy of these bands varies widely. At the
top end, you can get up to 388—pound re-
sistance with instructional DVDs for a
little under $130. On the lower end, you
can get some reliable bands with up to 100
pounds of resistance for around $15. The
exercises you can do with these bands are
basically unlimited. A simple example of
one workout is the bicep curl.

Take the band, holding one endin your
right hand and the other in your left. Then,
step down on the middle of the band with
your right foot, left foot or both feet. Once
the band is on the ﬂoor under your feet,

you can perform simple bicep curls just .

like you would with a free weight. One big
selling point of these bands is that studies
have shown them to be less stressful on
your bones and joints while focusing more
on the muscle belly. This makes them a
great choice for an everyday workout for
people of all training levels.

P90X: Probably the most popular of the
new chain of at—home workouts/P90X is
a workout based purely on the body with
no weights or equipment involved. On the
P90X website the system normally runs
for about $120; however, it isn’t unheard of
to find it online for free, and some people
resell it used for cheap. The workout is
based on something called “muscle con-

fusion.” Essentially, the idea is to keep

changing the workouts so rapidly and
with such variety that you never plateau
or become used to any one workout. In
this way, P90X is rumored to be one of
the best and most challenging fat burning
workouts on the market. i T .
Insanity: As if to one-up the P90_X,
the Insanity Workout is a more recent
concoction that promises amazing results
over a 60-day period rather than a 90-day

period. The workout, led by Shaun T, is_

supposed to be as hard as it gets. Here is
a snippet from its Website:

“Your personal trainer Shaun T will '

push you past your limits with 10 workout
discs packed with plyometric drills on top
of nonstop intervals of‘ strength, power,
resistance and ab— and core—training

The most common remedy for such oversight
that I’ve heard — or at least the most memo—
rable — is to pile all the food—encrusted dishes
and pans and grimy glasses in the offending
housemate’s bed. Which creates a pleasant
living situation for exactly no one.

What utilities must be paid?

Electric, gas, water — the bills can pile
up. Or they might be included in your rent.
Or some combination thereof. But it’s worth-
while to ask if the stove is electric or gas to

ﬁnd out whether you’ll be footing the bill for A V iv 

Electric, gas,
Water — the bills

major cooking.
How old are-the appliances?

Leaking faucets and broken ovens can be a
tremendous hassle. Not that new appliances

can’t misbehave too, but a refrigerator that 4
looks like it’s seen your parents’ or potentially” _
” your grandparents’ college days is a likely cul-

prit for stressful breakdowns.

Find out if previous tenants have had prob-
lems and, if you can track down an unbiased
source, how good your landlord is at address-
ing concerns promptly. You’ll be glad for this in
the ﬁiture should anything really go wrong.

Should you consider a place with mul-
tiple kitchens?

‘ The house that you pile eight of your closest
friends into for the year might not have been
built —— or at any rate retroﬁtted —- to accom-
modate such a group en masse. If it was intend-
ed to be rented as separate units, you could ﬁnd
yourself with two or even three kitchens. This
can be too much of a good thing.

Are you going to have to pay for gas or elec-
tric for spare stoves you’ll never use? Or deal

with additional malfunctioning appliances?‘

If you attempt to convert one kitchen into
some other form of living space, what are the
implications of that? These are all questions
to ask before you dive in.

Bearing these tips in mind, have a good i

search! I

can do anything from crunches to push-
ups, yoga, plyometrics and much more.
The key is finding safe and challenging
workouts without any extra equipment.
Here are two good examples:

Blake Griffin Push-ups —— Patented by
the Clippers forward Blake Griffin, these
push-ups involve changing the position
of your hands to attack different parts of
your chest.

The positions are pretty simple:

Regular push—up, wide—stance push—up,
diamond push-up (thumb and index ﬁn-
gers touching forming a diamond), right
hand high and left hand low push—up, left
hand high and right hand low pu_sh—up. Do
these consecutively (ﬁve total push-ups)
and that is one rep.

Try to do ﬁve sets of three reps or reps
until exhaustion.

Nine-Minute Abs —— this might re-“
quire either a partner or just a stop watch.
Essentially, you’re doing one abdominal
workout for one minute, changing the
workout eight times and trying to keep
your feet off the ground throughout.
