Men’s Election Day
Postponed A Week

- General election day for men
students has been moved back from
Wednesday, April 19, to the fol-
lowing Wednesday, April 26. An-
nouncement of the postponement
came from the oﬁice of the dean of
men late Wednesday afternoon and
was explained by Bob1Campbel1, in
charge of Student Congress elec-
tions. Campbell, who is now presi-
dent of ESGC, said, “The only
reason for postponing the elections
is to give prospective members of
Men’s Council a chance to com-
plete their petitions and hand them
in to the dean of men.”

Bob Baker, C, in charge of ar-
rangements for the Men’s Council
side of the elections, corroborated
Campbell’s statement by urging
men students who are interested in
becoming candidates for the va-
cated posts in Men’s council to get
petitions in the oﬁice of the dean
of men as soon as possible.

The elections are part of the
move by ESGC to obtain better
wartime student government on
«the Pitt campus. Ballots have
been outlined with a three-fold
purpose: electing members to
Men’s Council, conducting a plebes-
cite on the acceptance of the Stu-
dent Congress idea, and the elec-
tion of oﬂicers to this organization.

The ESGC nominating commit-
tee named the following men up
for election in the Congress: sen-
iors, John Whiteman, BA, Dick
Slater, E, Allen Motter, E, and
Fred Richardson, E; juniors——Bill
Devlin, C, Joe Siedlarz, C, Stanton
Tenchner, C, Grant Lee, C, Robert
Lazar, C, and Joe Stepek, C.

the dean of men to begin work
with the Civil Service. The basket-
ball team won another game!

Biggest event of February 11,
was the air corps musical produc-

Masonic Temple were obtained
with thepurchase of one thousand
dollar war bonds. And it went off
with a bang!

The issue of February 11 an-
nounced the E & M Dance.

Of great interest to the engi-
neers was an explanation of the
new draft deferment regulations.
A team of men debaters traveled
to Kent State to participate in a
tournament, and, to the amaze-
ment of all, departed with ﬁrst
place.

social fraternities and an an-
nouncement of the beginning of
rushing for men’s social fraterni-
ties. Girls wailed at the announce-
ment that the AST was to be pared

It’s not news about Howdy John-
son and Joby. But.(and this is a
scoop) what we know that Joby
doesn’t is that Howdy has been
around with Matilda Gratisharis -
glamour babe among the new fresh-
men— a great deal lately. This
comes from a conﬁdential source
strictly in the know. ‘

' Ted .Bloomei-"s doing‘ aeronautical
research at Langley Field, Virginia,
until /the Navy" calls him. Word
keeps coming back from him to keep
away from Lois Fair who is living
between letters.

Barbara Dan-ver used to get
around through the halls and in the
Tuck Shop without any help, but
now she has a bodyguard in Harry
Frank. We’ll take the job any day.
Another ring -over at the diamond
mine on Dithridge. This time it’s

man in Mississippi.

Question of the week department:
Since Grant ‘Lee is president, secre-
tary-treasurer, and accompanist in
Men’s Glee Club, who could the vice-
president be? Things like that keep
us awake nights.

An engagement to hit the papers
is that of Nicky Cicero and Private
Joseph Toia, just back from the
Aleutians. He was a Pitt man before
entering the service.

’ The Tuck Shop cake concession
is being taken over next month by
Pattie Watt. She baked a cake for

was really something. Lemon, nice
sticky icing, and such. '

was “Join Phi Mu and Get In the

isn’t it a little ridiculous? ,
Thought for today: Who is Wil-

News comes to us a little late
(very late, to be truthful) of an im-
promptu party for a hundred at Bill
Newstetter’s house when Bill was
home a few weeks ago. Bill didn’t
even know some of the guests him-
self, which, of course, made it that
much better. However, the Newstet-
ters have been living on K-ration
ever since.

Rumors reach us (and we’re nuts
about printing rumors) that the

‘T UP THE HILL ’"
By BILL AUL

Hello GD—oops! I mean Gls. (En-
gineers are being tapped into Up-
silon Sigma Alpha—--USA to you-
next month). All the engineers are
getting new summer suits with that
sharp(?) looking GI sun-tan color
that changes to dry mud color by
September unless you don’t wash
your clothes. (We don’t know what
Aul means either.) What I’m get-
ting around to is the fact that the
engineers are going to the Army.
(At long last Upsilon Sigma Alpha
has caught up with us.)

With the departure of the AST’s
imminent and the engineers getting
1-A's by the envelope-full, Pitt co-
eds are living a date—to-date exist-
ence. These days they’re going on
the assumption that old adages are
true, especially the one which says,
“The best way to hold a man is in
your arms.”

Basketball Flaslz
 Doe3 Gypry Lee

Recent basketball ﬂash of the Un-
iversity, Sergeant Morton C. Reifer,
Ed 42, is skyrocketing morale of
fellow soldiers to a new high at Fort
Bragg, North Carolina, these days.

vsergeant Reifer, who cinched the
success of the '42 Cap and Gown
show, “Snap Your Fingers," by his
portrayal of the feminine lead, has
kept GI’s happy by directing, pro-
. ducing, and acting in several Army
shows since his induction.

However, the general esteem and
approval of the men is not all the
compensation he receives. In a let-
ter to Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, he wrote, “One of the great-
est thrills I have had in depicting
female roles was a recent appear-
ance in a show with Gypsy Rose
Lee, who visited us here at Bragg.
It seems she desired some G1 to
do a ‘take off’ on her ‘take off, and
I was assigned that role.”

After the performance, Miss Lee
presented him with a costume she
had ‘worn iii the show “Star and Car-
ter” and asked him to continue to
do that number at any request. (Ser-
geant Reifer i.<n’t ﬁnding Army life
I exactly dull!)

Pittsburgh Center Plans
Inter-American Institute

Now only four months old, the Pittsburgh Regional Inter-Ameri-
can Center will review its accomplishments of the past and make plans
for the future at -its first institute, today and tomorrow.

Prominent good neighbor policy»?-

three-day institute, the Center has‘

for college students of this region.

Held an educational conference
for the teaching of inter-Ameri-
can subjects in cooperation with
public schools and colleges of the
county.

Established sub-centers at West
Virginia University and at Mar-
shall College.

Because the directors feel that the
culture and educational value of the
Center is well established, they plan
to stress the economic aspects of
the program in the future. They
hope that a ermanent Center, sup-
ported by local funds, can be organ-
ized. This permanent organization
would include an economic co-direc-
tor who would stimulate Latin-
American interests in the great in-
dustrial output of the tri-state area
and, at the same time, acquaint the
business men of this region with the
vast potentialities of the countries
to the south.

The institute, sponsored by the
local colleges and universities, is to
be conducted in Stephen Foster
Memorial. Carnegie Hall, and the
Faculty Club.

The Pittsburgh Center is directed
by Dr. J. Warren Nystrom, assist-
ant professor of geography at Pitt,
and Dr. Robert D. Gregg, head of
the history department at Carnegie
Tech.

 l“r(I‘.I.etter writing seems to be the favorite pastime around school.

any7iriore§“A'rid3 the mailman is deﬁnitely everyone’: best friend. We

like to hear what our old pals are

doing and we know that they like

to hear about each other. It is for this purpose that we dedicate this
‘column to Pitt men and women over here and over there.)

First Lt. Smith T. Charland, who<‘v

graduated in ’42, is now stationed
overseas with a reconnaissance
squadron. He writes, “As yet, I have
met no Pitt grads on this island ‘of
New'Guinea, except Lt. Ed Mosko
who has been with me in this or-
ganization since we entered the Air
Corps from ROTC.”

Kenneth Yeager writes from
‘northern Ireland, “Here I am in the
land of Ulster and the home of the
orange. Being in a. strange land, I
find that I am in for a great many
new experiences, and each day I
learn or see something different. I
must confess that driving on the
left side of the road (particularly
around a left curve going up a steep
hill) still gives me a funny feel-
ing. I doubt whether I could be sit-
uated in any more beautiful a land

a ‘as far as scenic beauty is c‘onc,erned.v
The land is rich and consists of

many small farms, since agriculture

‘seems to be their major industry.

The people all have quite rosy
i¢heeks—-due, no doubt, to the quan-

flity of milkip'rodu;cts they consume.”

[He was a sociology major at Pitt,
and he should be getting an enor-

mous amount of sociological data.)

Stationed in Alaska, as a Coast
Artillery Oﬂicer, :‘Lt.- Paul Schau-
ghency quips about this where-
abouts, “We’re somewhere in the
Aleutians where it rains in Russia
and blows over here horizontally!”

Pfc. Elmer Match, down in Kees-
ler Field, Miss., says that he and
Burt Englesburg, who is in ’ his
squadron, have been busy exchang-
ing notes on “the, gang.” His com-
ment——“They certainly are spread
out.” ,

Congratulations to Lt. William
Molfat Mn’43, who on February
21 married Helen Marie Stewart.
While at Pitt, Bill was a member of
Pitt Riﬂes and Scabbard and Blade;
he is stationed now» in Boston, Mass.,
with the Coast Artillery.

Information about the McKenna
clan comes from Lt. Charles McKen-
na, who is working as Intelligence
Officer in the Infantry at Camp
Swift, Texas: “Frank, In, Law ’31,
is a Lt. Col. on the staff of the 14th

Armored Division; Bernard, Pol.
Sci.’39, is a Lt. (j.g.) in the Navy
and has spent considerable time in
the Atlantic.” Their cousin Bill,
BusAd’38, has reached the rank of
major in the Air Corps; he is sta-
tioned in Georgia.

In July ’41, Richard Jones en-
tered the service as a private’ in
the Infantry; within the next year
he received his commission at Ft.
Benning, Ga. Now a captain, Dick
is with the 103rd Infantry Divis-
ion, at_Camp Howze, Texas.

Major‘ Larry Bachman, of the
Medical Corps, writes from Italy,
“We,’re al—l,eag,er for the big Europ-
ean invasion. Still having our share
of mud, but it’s gettingwarmerr over
here, and ‘soon all the many fruit
trees a'nd_..grape,vines should be bud-
ding.” In Italy, too, is .1st Lt. Ron-
ald Elling, who is with a ﬁghter
squadron; he writes: “I spent ﬁve
days at an Army Air Force rest
camp.-- (Resort hotel, good food,
beds with sheets.) Still operating

strong, and this will be my 17th ..

month over here.-’’- Lt. ‘Elling -then
goes into his oration about mud and
rain. .  a  .; _ 

. Sgt. Bert Jaﬂe is working these
days with the Provost Marshall’s Of-
ﬁce. His comment about his service
overseas is: “I’ve been transferred
to the mainland after 14 months of
comparative ease in New Guinea;
why I even had a jeep of my own."
He is now doing civilian investiga-
tion work, and ‘talks about being
driven all around by a WAC.

Home on a leave recently, Lt.

Irv Lieber is back at Camp Ed-
wards, Mass., where he is sta-
tioned with the Coast Artillery.
Lt. and Mrs. Boyd Kimberl-ing
spent a whole afternoon at school,
while Bud was on leave from Cal-
ifornia, to see all their friends
and talk over old times. Bud is
doing CA work, too.

Former campus editor of the Pitt
News, Jack Brady, who graduated
in ’42, gives an excellently vivid pic-
ture of the country overseas in
which he is now stationed: “I ﬁnally
arrived over in the Emerald Isle,

‘The iPitt'“‘fWe1vs

where the Irish brogues are not
half as thick as the ﬂies and the
mosquitos in the Carolina swamps.
Ireland is as beautiful a state as
my father has always led me to be-
lieve. Rolling hills, patchwork farms
along the mountain sides, and grass
that is always green; the wind howls
about half the time, and rain al-
ways chances on you at the time you
aren’t carrying your raincoat. The
skies are blue though, and although
the silver lining isn’t noticeable,
I’m pretty sure it’s there. The peo-
ple are friendly, and the kids con-
stantly run up to you andjust give
you a sly questioning whisper ‘Can-
dy’?” Jack speaks about the beer
not being Iron City and the power-
ful whiskey.

After a_ year of Army training in
the States, Pfc. Hal Gondelman at
Fort Custer, Mich., says that, he
sort of looks forward to foreign ser-
vice. “I’ve marched in snow up to
my ‘knees, go-nethrough the battle‘
innoculation course in mud up to my
ears. while Ivwas in a. prone posi-
tion, and marched in retreat par-
ades in blinding blizzards. There’s
nothing like basic training. I’d love
to- see the Cathedral lawn and the
old gang lounging about,” he
writes.- “ *_ - '~ ” ‘ ' 
, A great“ '-many‘ of ‘- the Heinz
Chapel Choinalumni are in vari- .
ous branches of, the service and
are scatteredhall over the globe:

’.Bob Davis ‘recently received’ his
captaincy in the Air” Force; he
was ﬂown at various times over
England, Africa, Sicily and Italy.~ —
V Lt. Milton, Moss, overseas for six-
teen months, is now stationed in
Italy.

In Alaska for over nine months,
Lt. Alvin Glass recently returned-
home on a twenty-day leave during
which he married Esther Deaktor;
Cpl. Vic Carlson arrived safely in
India a few months ago; others-—
Ben Fleck, Ellis Van Swearington,
and Orva Ice are still in the States.

A/C Arnie Bree, who is stationed
at Kirtland Field, Albuquerque,
New Mexico, has this to say about
his training: “We ﬂy every day if
the weather permits it and average.
about ﬁve hours of ground school’
daily. If Lady Luck sticks with me,
PH ﬁnally graduate here with my
bombardier’s wings the early part

of April.” Arnie mentioned that his

 

  
 
 

fraternity brother Len .Wo1k is now
a corporal in England.

From San Marcos, Texas, A/C
John Bruchas writes, “I was in the
Caribbean area until last June,
when I returned for navigation
training. I have gotten into some hot
arguments about the wonderful
school in Oakland, and it’s lucky
that I have plenty of Pittsburghers
to help me with the arguments. You
can’t beat a good “Panther”!

The Whiteman brothers, Sam-
uel and Jack, are both in the ser-
vice overseas, in diﬂerent branch-
es and in different areas. Samuel,
who graduated in ’40 is a lieuten-
ant, ﬂying transports for the Fer-
ry Command; he has been in Eng-
land and various other places. His
wife and two children live in Flor-
ida. Pvt. Jack, ’38 graduate, is in
New Guinea with the Signal

;Corps; he instructed there for a
while. Perhaps one day, the boys_
will get together over there. ‘
From Ft. Oglethorpe, Ga., comes
word that Evangeline Bassing-
thwaite, who received her master of
arts degree from Pitt in 1932, was
commissioned a second lieutenant in
the WAC.

There are scores of promotions
to tell about: A/C Charles _Kilgore
and Jackpllutchinson have received

commissions in the Army  Corps ‘

William ‘Lester and Bernard’ Rogohf

-were botlr commissioned second lieu-

tenantsin, the _Army Air Force; A/C.
Donald McQuade was appointed a
ﬂight officer in the Army Air Force;
William‘ J. Stewart now wears a pair
of silver wings. In the Coast Artil-

lery Leonard Bortz, Martin Faber- ..
mamand George Chirigos recently.

received second ’Iieutenant"s com-
missions. ‘ A I ’ ‘ ‘
In the service for “ eleven ’
months, Aleck Chizeck has done
a lot of overseas traveling; he
has been in Africa and is now in
Italy in the midst of battle. In
Italy too, Cpl. Everett Green has
served in every African campaign
from Oran to Tunis. At present,
he has been overseas for 15
months and is now taking part in
the Italian campaign.

Since Sept. ’43 George Boehm,
who was in pre-Law, has been serv-

Long, crazy letters from former i

campus editor Carl Eisenbeis keep“
“members of the Pitt News staff

amused—and on their toes. Carl, _

who is stationed at Bucknell, can’ ’
still tell us how to run _a good news-if ‘

islands‘ where the natives have“

orange hair. They put somethingin’
"their hair to kill the ‘”-lice_and*it'

Three members of the Ponzo
_ family, all former Pitt men, are
in the service. Ensign Angelo is
in a naval construction battalion
somewhere in the Paciﬁc and was
active in organizing an orchestra
for his group. Pvt. Robert is in

‘F Within the past few months, Lt. John P. Bracken and ll/laj. Jay W.‘

Pitt Gmcls

 _i iboverspike have been awarded the Legion of Merit citation. They are

the only two Pitt men to have rece
is bestowed for outstanding abilit

ived this honor. The Legion of l.\”lerit .

3' beyond the line of duty an-d has

generally been con.:-idered a reward for action not including combat.
‘I ‘Lt. Bracken, "34, of the USNR, received the citation for work in
setting up plans for the defense of Aruba-Curacao in the Caribbean

A . and for “exceptional meritorious

conduct and service to the United

States‘. . . for his judgment and exercise of executive authority."
according to the letter received by his mother. The paper was signed
by President Roosevelt and by Secretary of Navy Franklinox. Rear

Admiral A. G. Robinson decorated

saw action» on the “Marblehead.”

‘Major Doverspihe, who is serving
with the engineering units, was
"given the award. for outstanding
work in the Southwest Paciﬁc, by
Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

'.. The major and his party were

surrounded for seven months by en-
emy patrols on an island group. All
that time communication lines were
‘cut, and although his wife, Ruth,
and four-year-old daughter, Judith
Ann, continuedpto hear from him,
.. they had no idea where he was. They

' have not seen him for over two
- "years. General headquarters in the

Southwest Paciﬁc commended him
for his supervision of the design-
ing and construction of an airbase
‘and facilities on Norfolk Island. He
completed his project despite enemy
interference; he discharged ships
without losses even though inexper-
ienced labor‘ and improvised carriers
-were used to unload machinery and
supplies.

"A Major Doveispike is now serxing
in Australia. While enrolled at Pitt
$25 an engineer, he competed in cross-
country meets, belonged to the Glee
Club, and was an oﬁicer of Phi Del-
ta Theta.

Further honor was brought to
“ Pitt's alumni when Lt. Bracken
was made Knight of the Orange

Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina six

months ago. More recently, he was

an aid to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
- on her tour to island bases in the
Caribbean Sea and is now an aid

After 3 5 Raids
Tells His Talc

Home from 35 raids of the oldest
group in the Middle East was Lib-
erator Pilot Capt. Edwin L. Gluck,
C38. Capt. Gluck considers the raid
on Viener Neustadt where Ameri-
can planes bombed a Focke-Wulf
factory the most outstanding of all.

“We ﬂew the entire length of the
Adriatic and the width of the
Mediterranean. After the raid we
flew back to Africa. The round
trip was nearly 2,500 miles. and
that raid worried us more than
any of the others. The Germans
had ﬁghter planes up and plenty
of ack-rack,” said Captain Gluck.

He said that C__}ermans can be di-
vided into two classes——the brave
and the others. Goering’s Yellow-
Nose Squadron, which he encoun-
tered at dilferent times, didn’t close
in until they saw the planes were
damaged by ack-ack.

A member of the wave of Lib-
erators to hit the Ploesti oil ﬁelds.
the captain said that their brief-
ing included the ﬁve biggest reﬁn-
eries. “It was all low level bomb-
ing. Two Liberators hit the
ground; one damaged a wing, and
another lost an engine, but they
both returned safely.”

Flying only Liberators, Captain
Gluck said that they carried as many
bombs on that trip 815 a Flying For-
tress carries on a short trip, and
that they did all precision bombing.

He called Messina “Aclc-Ack al-
ley,” and Malta “the life-saver of
many of our pilots when you "had to
make a forced landing in bad wea-
ther.”

Holder of the Distinguished
Service Cross and Air Medal, Cap-
tain Glucl-; and his crew were cit-
ed for volunteering for an exper-
imental and dangerous attack on
enemy installations in March of
1943.

He enlisted in the Air Forces in
.lul_\7, 19:11, and went overseas in
May of 1942.

DELlNE   COACH

By LEN TANNENBAUM
sports editor

'/{Good Man Nowadays Is Hard to Find
, g For the first time since 1909 the sound of the starter’s
gun will not echo in Pitt Stadium this spring. Intercollegiate
track has become the Panther’s first major sports casualty of
the war. Golf also will be dropped but baseba.ll and tennis
squads will. carry the Panther banner through the spring sport
campaign. _

Athletic director Hagan and his staff have been reluctant
to drop any intercollegiate sport but the meek response to their
calls for candidates made such a move emminent. With only a

T handful of inexperienced thinclads and a group of middle 80

and 90 golfers, it would be pure folly to engage such teams as

 Army and Navy. \ z’

, If these two sports are the only Pitt war-time casualties,
however, the Panther will be indeed fortunate. For the de-
cision to curtail the spring sport card comes on the heels of an
ominous edict from Congress at a time when college athletics
in general face their darkest outlook. If Congressshould go
through with their much talked of plan to draft 4F’s for es-
sential work and to call up many of the deferred students, the
hope for the continuation of intercollegiate sport/scompetition
will receive a. crippling if not fatal blow.

However, the Panther‘ authorities with whole-hearted stud-
entsupport hope to carry on as long as possible. Some 35 can-
didates have signed up for baseball and have been hard at
work for the past three weeks. The diamond outlook is opti-
mistic with a handful of veterans of last year’s campaign
and a group of promising yearlings encouraging the hopes
of Coach" Mitterling for a victorious season. In addition
to the baseball squad the list of tennis candidates promises
Pitt another first rate net team. The “racket makers” will
have two grisards on the roster and about ten hopefuls trying
to make the grade. ~

Pitt "T” Party Rousing Success

Over 400 high school grid coaches from Pennsylvania,
Ohio, West Virginia, New Jersey, and New York attended
Professor Clark Shaughnessy’s football clinic last week-end.
The three-day clinic, which started Thursday night, enlight-
gened not a. few of the schoolboy mentors on the numerous ex-

plosive possibilities of the “T” formation. The Panther basket-»

ball pavilion was the sight of this, the most successful war-

time football clinic ever held. Entertainment consisted of chalk

talks, diagrams, demonstrations by members of the Panther
, football team, and motion pictures showing the Chicago Bears
» with the “T” at its best. ’

PSKA Mermen Are IF Champs
The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity is apparently the one
which “swims through. the water with. the greatest of ease.”
For they piled up enough points in the interfraternity swim
xmeet last week. to take the individual and team honors in a
hotly contested meet before a ﬁeld of eight fraternities. Run-
ner up to the winners was Delta Tau Delta, closely followed
by Sigma Chi. The others in the order of their ﬁnish: Phi

Gamma Delta, Phi Epsilon Pi, Pi Lambda Phi tied with Phi

Delta Theta, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

With more Pitt athletes every day
becoming members of Uncle Sam’s
rapidly growing family, reunions be-
tween Pitt men in service are no
doubt becoming more common oc-
curences. Many of you men may un-
knowingly be stationed close togeth-
er now.

The most recent Pitt contributions
to the long line of Panther sport
personalities in service have been
the standout performers of Clark
Shaughnessy’s recent gridiron squad
and several of Doc Carlson’s “little
toughies”; whose performance on
the basketball court the past season,
while not in line with the ever op-
timistic doctor’s “win ’em all” spir-
it, accounted for a highly creditable
7 and 7 record against some of the
country’s stiiifest opposition. Beth-
any College in West Virginia seems
to have drawn the bulk of the new
recruits, all of whom have chosen
the Navy blue. In this group are Joe
Mocha, ace quarterback and passing
sensation of Clark Shaughnessy’s
first year squad, and Cy Plazak, like
Mocha a quarterback and V-5 train-
ee, in addition to V-5 candidates
Rudy Buck and Bill Pandak, mem-
bers of last season’s “little tough-
ies.”

Also wearing “bell bottom trous-
ers and a coat of navy blue” are Jim
Maloney, star pass catching end for
the blue and gold (or red and white),
and Harry Alward and Red Fowler.
Al Marangoni, a tackle of the same
squad, is now a pharmacist’s mate
at Great Lakes.

Members of Charley Bowser’s
1942 eleven, scattered throughout
eastern U. S., may have a re-union
sooner than they expect as many of
them are near each other. Mike So-
tack and Jack MacCluskey are sta-
tioned in a V-12 unit at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania where both
were valuable additions to the foot-
ball squad. MacCluskey was named
on some All-American elevens in
addition to almost unanimous choice
as All-State center.

“Wild Bill” Dutton was the star
performer on the Bainbridge, Mary-
land team. Jim Marides played part
of the season for Penn State before
moving on to Oﬂicer’s Candidate

Among Leaders In Service

. Omicron Delta Kappa taps men because they are active on campus.
Pitt ODK men prove that afterthey leave school they are still “on the
go.” Some are not very good letter writers, but news has come from
quite a few, and these letters come from all over the world.

Take Lt. Jerome J. Hock, Jr., E42, for example. In 18 months over-

‘ seas, he has visited India, Jerusalem, Egypt, North Africa, Sicily, and

Italy and has crossed over 20,00G¢

miles of water! He was the aeronau-

Squadron which shot down 74
planes last" April and chased 2,000
miles over the 8th Army’s coastal
trail to catch the 57th in Tripoli-
tania.

Lt. Hock, now stationed in Na-
ples, recently visited the rest camp
at the Isle of Capri, where he met
several members of Italian royal-
ty. He was invited to their villa
for dinner and was shown a col-
lection of family heirlooms that
had been passed down since 1300.

Although he was detailed to take
the enlisted men to see the operas,
“Madame Butterﬂy” and “Pagliac-

lost his complete wardrobe when an
airﬁeld wasblown up around him.
Shortly after he landed in Europe,
a bomb, fortunately a dud, crashed
.’through_his tent.
Lt. Hock, who was written up in
-the February 13, 1944 issue of
»Forward Ho, newspaper of the
314th Squadron, was the second man
 the history of the University to
be tapped from night school to
0fD'I{o

Also in Italy are Bt. Aldo Icar-

di. C43, and S/Sgt. William B.

Clemmer. Lt. Icardi, former cheer-

leader and president of Independ-

3 cm Association, is living in a cas-

tle. that once belonged to a coun-

tess. He writes that recently he

— ran into Jim Hunter and Ernie
vi Bonelli, both Pitt boys.

Ensign Gus Wilde, C43, aboard a
Navy PT boat, Ensign Steve Minno,
aboard the USS Mackinac, and Lt.
.(i,g.) Joseph Kristufek, a Navy ﬂier
zvith a torpedo squadron, are all

somewhere in the Paciﬁc.” Lt.
Kristufek writes that he has gotten
one Jap plane for himself and that
he hopes to get one for Dean Biddle.

Stationed in Hawaii are Captain
Robert C. Adams, a former Pitt News
editor, and Captain Jack Withium,
active in Pitt Riﬂes and Scabbard

William Petrick is in Trinidad.

Cpl. William McElwain, a for-
mer “Pitt News” writer, is on the
stall’ of the Army newspaper,
“Stars and Stripes.” Captain Wil-
liam McQuade, who received the
senior award in 1937, and Sgt.

ODK president for the summer
and fall of 1943, Pfc. Holbert Car-
roll, is studying Chinese under the
Army Specialized Training program
at Yale. His successor to oﬁice, ‘Lt.
Robert Sullivan, is in the Coast Ar-
tille_ry. - .

Two former Cap and Gown
stars, Captain Russell Connolly,
’36,. and Lt. Jack Hoeveler are in
service in the United States. Cap-
tain Connolly is at Camp Swift,
Texas, while Lt. Hoeveler is sta-
tioned at Fort Washington, Mary-
land.

Lt. Michael DeMarco, C43, former
technical manager of Pitt Players,
recently was working outside of
Washington, D. C. Lt. (j.g.) Pat
Cusick is an. officer in charge of
Navy construction in Baltimore, and
Captain Edward T. Tait, who re-
ceived the senior award in 1942, is
working at Camp Edwards, Massa-
chusetts.

Bell Titled “Man
Who Came Back”

Gaptain Paul N. Bell, formerly
of the University’s School of Busi-
ness Administration, and now with
the 23rd Fighter Group in China,
has earned for himself the title of
“the man who came back,” for
three times within the space of a
single year he has been reported
oﬁicially “missing in action.”

Captain Bell was ﬁrst listed as
missing February, 1943, when his
plane was shot down in such a re-
mote spot that it took him a month
of walking and riding horseback
in the Yunnan Mountains before
he reached his base again. At this
time his friends gave him his title,
but he kept right on reinforcing
it, for he was again listed as miss-
ing in June of 1943. A soft-nosed
bullet struck his plane and split,
half of it entering his neck on the
left side of the jugular vein and
wounds, however, he ﬂew his par-
half on the right. Despite his
tially disabled plane 30 miles back
to his air-ﬁeld.

Shortly afterward he was listed
as missing again and this time had
to spend considerable time in a
hospital with a broken leg after
he was found. He was entitled to
a furlough home but refused it.

Captain Bell has been decorated
with the Air Medal and Cluster,
Silver Star and Cluster, the Pur-
ple Heart, and the Chinese Order

A typewriter is as much a part

Unlike many war correspondents, these men have to lll\(iel‘gt):I‘GgI_l«;.-‘v’, , 9 -

ratings as sergeants and assigned v.,

to units which are headed over-

and when the going gets tough
they pitch in and do their share of
the ﬁghting.

S/ Sgt. Spiegel graduated from the

the Johnstown Democrat in his
