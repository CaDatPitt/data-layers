Henry Kissinger, former
secretary of state and renowned
international consultant, told
members of the Pittsburgh
business community that Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev faces
many hardships in leading his
country in a speech yesterday in
the William Pitt Union Assembly
Room. ‘

STUDENTS PROTEST
EXCLUSION FROM LECTURE

The speech was part of the HJ.
Heinz Company Distinguished
Lecture Program, which is held
annually to recognize two people
who were awarded a fellowship
from the HJ. Heinz Company to
study at Pitt. The two winners
this year were Munir Ahmed of
Pakistan and Ramon Noriel B.
Sicad of the Philippines.

“The fact is, throughout the
course of history, the Soviet Union
has equated insecurity with the
physical possession of territory,”
Kissinger said. “One individual
cannot reverse 700 years of Soviet
history.”

He said that even ifGorbachev
survives politically, there will be
many people in the Soviet Union
that will try to discredit him. “The
victor in the Soviet Union always
announces the disgrace of the
loser,” he said. “Not one Soviet
leader in their history has ever
retired or left office with dignity.
No Soviet can walk into his office
with the confidence of any
American president or CEO. There
is a constant power struggle.”

Mike Seperack gets $8,200 a
year from the Reserve Officers’
Training Corps and for all intents
and purposes it would be ideal
for him if it stays this way.

“For me, if ROTC was thrown
off campus it would mean losing
a lot. To lose that much over [the
discrimination against gays] issue
would be a tragedy,” he said.

Seperack is one of 44 students’

who are on full scholarship at Pitt
courtesy of the Department of
Defense.

Behind the national controversy
over the discrimination of gays
and lesbians by the DOD, there
are students at Pitt who rely on
DOD scholarship money to
finance their education. For many
of the scholarship students, the
ROTC is the only reason that they
are able to afford to attend college.

“Out of 17 people [in the fourth

But Kissinger also said that this
process works in reverse. “When
the Politburo elects a leader, that
person subsequently purges those
who elected him,” he said. “.\'ot
one person who voted for
Gorbachev five years ago is still
there today.”

Kissinger said that three factors
will determine Gorbachev’s
success in the future: the state of
the Soviet economy, the political
legitimacy of the Communist Party
and ethnicity in the Soviet ljnion.

He described the ethnic
situation as the biggest problem.

“There are 16 different republics
in the Soviet Union. Fifty percent

of the Soviet population isn’t,

Russian. Only one republic,
Russia, is Russian, and only three
of those are Slavic. Most of the
republics in the Soviet Union do
not consider themselves Russian,”
he said. “The ethnic organizations
that are confined [in the Soviet
Union] are hostile to Moscow.
The Soviet Union has gone from
one-party rulefto one mad rule.

“For the next few years, the
Soviet Union will be torn between
tendencies toward chaos and
tendencies toward repression,”
he added.

But Kissinger warned that the
United States cannot become
complacent because of these
changes. “If perestroika succeeds,

the Soviet Union will be powerful 0

again,” he said. “They will still
have l10,000l to 15,000 nuclear
warheads. They will still have the
ability to project their power well.”

Kissinger said that Gorbachev
has “given up” on Eastern Europe.
“The only way that Gorbachev
could preserve the Russian empire

there. Their families just don’t
have the money. They still have
problems because the army

doesn’t pay for their food, money
or anything,” said Lieutenant
Colonel Michael Geoghagan.

The ROTC’s full scholarships
are comprised of up to $7,000
towards tuition, $400 a year for
books and supplies and a 3100
dollar stipend every month during
the semester. These scholarships
are given out on four, three or
two year plans. In return, students
who contract with the army must
commit themselves to eight years
in the army, to be served in a
combination of reserve, active or
inactive service.

In the case that a student does
not fulfill their obligation to the
DOD, they can be forced to pay
back the scholarship money,
which can add up to as much as
840,000. Such was the case with
James Holobaugh, a cadet in the
ROTC program at Washington
University in St. Louis. Holobaugh
may be forced to pay back the
almost 325,000 he received in
scholarship funds because he

informed the military that he is
83)’-

Last year, the scholar-ships that
the army provided, along with
other maintenance costs, added
up to $298,001 that the ROTC
contributed at Pitt. The university,
in turn, provides the ROTC with
office and classroom space in the
Cathedral of Learning.

University President Wesley
Posvar, addressing ‘the
contradiction between the
university’s anti-discrimination
policy against homosexuals and
the DOD’s ban on homosexuals,
said that, “The net benefit, the
financial benefit of the ROTC, is
to Pitt. Pitt is not giving money to
the ROTC.”

University Senate President
James Mauch was in the ROTC in
college and said that he can see
the benefits of the program.

‘'1 could not have made it
through college without the ROTC
help but there are other things to
consider. it is a difficult issue."

Student exclusion from lecture sparks campus protests

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Not everybody was happy with
the presence of Henry Kissinger
on the Pitt campus yesterday.

About 15 to 20 students from
two separate groups stood outside
the Assembly Room in the William
Pitt Union_protesting two separate
issues.

One group was protesting the
fact that students were not invited
to hear Kissinger’s speech. Gayle
Drake and Steve Chuchat,
members of an ad hoc group,
said that this isn’t the first time
students have been excluded from

speeches.

“Students continue to be
excluded from these events,”
Drake said. “Pitt is inviting these
big speakers but not inviting the
students. We can’t even voice
our opinions.”

Chuchat criticized Pitt President
Wesley Posvar for not letting
students into the speech, even
though the university is gaining
from the event. “Pitt is gaining
financially from these speeches,
yet they’re not open to the
students,” he said. “There is no
communication between Posvar
and the students in financial
matters.”

Drake criticized the way the
university was running the
program, and offered a proposal.
“If the business elite of Pittsburgh
doesn't want to associate with
the students of the university,

that’s their decision,” she said. “I .

propose that the university either
hold two separate speeches or
move the speech to a bigger
facility.”

Jane Reid, a senior philosophy
major and a leader of the other

group, criticized the fact that
Kissinger was called a
“distinguished” speaker.

“The economic elite would
rather not remember Kissinger’s
past,” she said. “But Pitt should
be aware of it. They should be
more careful about who is a
distinguished speaker and who
is not.”

Both groups denied that they
were protesting against Kissinger
or any of his policies.

Kissinger

Continued from page I ‘
was to give up Eastern Europe,”
he said. “He had to convince his
colleagues that the Soviet Union
could not holddown the growing
nationalism in Eastern Europe,
and even in their own people.”
He added that he did not expect
this move, and didn’t know of
anyone who did.

“I was surprised to see how fast
the Communist Parties evaporated
in the region,” he said.

Kissinger said that the United
States was not ready for the

. magnitude of these events. “The

United States has never had to
deal with the management of an
international system,” he said.
“Every president from Wilson to
Reagan, with the exception of
Nixon, has operated under the
premise that the United States

alone is immune to the
considerations of the balance of
power.”

He said that one of the biggest
challenges that our country faces
is determining goals. “The
challenge is to define the long-
range goals of our policy,”
Kissinger said. “We must educate
leaders of both parties to
distinguish between the tactical
and long- range goals.”

Kissinger ended his speech by I

saying that it is actually good to
be facing these problems today.
“There is no such thing as a fixed
American national purpose to the
region,” he said. “But this is a
good problem to have. We have
achieved what we wanted to
achieve. The shape of our future
in our hands.”

H.]. Heinz Co. pic/eltng Pitt

The University of Pittsburgh was very fortunate yester-
day to host one of the premier voices on foreign policy,
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Kissinger is
renowned for his expertise in the areas of East—West
relations and European affairs, a topic on which he spoke
yesterday.

Any political-science major and many history majors
can give you some type of an assessment, whether it be
negative or positive, of Kissinger’s policies as secretary of
state and national security adviser under former President
Richard ‘Nixon. His name can be heard in classroom
lectures during a typical university day. Many of these
students would have been thrilled to attend Kissinger’s
lecture at the William Pitt Union, if only to see such a well-
known figure. Student attendance at the event could
provide some interesting discourse on some of the points
made by Kissinger that are discussed "in classes today.
Instead of a student relying on his or her professor’s
interpretation of the goals sought by Nixon during his trip
to China, here was a chance to pose the question to the
man who orchestrated it.

However, students were barred from attending the
event. Understandably, this could be due to a number of
reasons, such as security precautions. However, this
event, sponsored by H.J. Heinz Company as its sixth
Distinguished Lecture for the H.J. Heinz Company Foun-
dation Fellowship Program, has never been open to
students. And past speakers have not been nearly as
popular as Kissinger.

We feel that the H.J. Heinz Co. should open the event
to Pitt students, especially considering the fact that they
are using a university facility for the event. After all, we
wouldn’t even consider such a request if the event had
taken place at the Westin William Penn or somewhere
else downtown. ‘

In attending the event or looking back at it, one has an
image of Kissinger speaking from a blue platform embla-
zoned with a large “Heinz” emblem. It seems as though

- it would be in the best interests (i.e., advertising) of H.J.

Heinz to allow as many viewers as possible to see that
emblem. In just such a situation, students can be the
viewers.

For that matter, it seems as though students would have
been a more active audience. Only two questions were
asked by audience members during the final segment of
Kissinger’s lecture.

We appreciate the fact that H.J. Heinz would bring, and
does bring, outstanding speakers to the University of
Pittsburgh. However, the goal of a university is to educate
its students and to open their eyes to the world. Given that
neither of these objectives were accommodated yester-
day, the university missed an ample opportunity to
provide such privileges to its students.

I remember the first time I saw
Platoon; my friend and I walked
out of the theater feeling a little
shell—shocked. I was trying to
cover up the fact that I had been
crying, and he was trying not to
think about what he would have
done in the swamps of Vietnam.
Regardless of how much verisi-
militude of the Vietnam conflict

this movie presented, it made for I

an interesting look into man’s
internal absolutes: what each
person considered good or bad.
I really liked it  back then.

Then the movie won several
Academy awards. Charlie Sheen
was on every cover of the indus-
try’s magazines. Oliver Stone was
being interviewed and touted as
“the hottest director” in the field,
and a surge of copycat films
about the Vietnam War soon
emerged.

Not to be far behind was the
fashion industry, which embla-
zoned peace symbols on every-
thing, and soon a new genera-
tion of hippie wanna-bes came
into the picture.

Certainly Stone was not re-
sponsible for all of the renewed
interest in the events of the '60s
and early ’70s, but to a large
degree Platoon did generate some
new curiosity on the part of
historians and the business in-
dustry.

Then there was his film Wall
Street, yet another film with
Charlie Sheen, who this time was
co-starring with Michael Douglas.
White-collar crime with Daryl
Hannah thrown in . yawn.

Then Born on the Fourth of
July came out and, well, you
know the hype. The only part of
the movie I really liked was
Willem Dafoe because he isn’t
the pretty young boy that Stone
likes to cash in on. (I mean Tom
Cruise could not have pulled off
being Jesus Christ.)

But now Stone has gone too
far by announcing that he is going
to make a_ film about the lead
singer of The Doors, Jim Morri-

   
 
   

nT

Conservative writers like John
Lofton have already begun their
attack on Stone’s move to immor-
talize Morrison in film. Lofton is
aghast that Stone would want to
make a movie about the life of the
lateJim Morrison, who did a lot of

 Jssic
Coville

drugs, was reportedly married to
a witch and wanted to “sleep with
his mother.”

In one area I do agree with
Lofton, and that is whydoes Stone
want to do this film?

Stone himself says, ‘‘There’s a
lot of bad boy in me  I identify
with Morrison. He was a shaman.
He was a god for me, a Dionysian
figure, a poet, a philosopher. I’d
like to bring his life out into the
light.”

Obviously inspired by the 1980
biography No One Here Gets Out
Alive, Stone has taken it graciously
upon himselfto bring yet another
person’s “life out into the light,”
much like he did with Ron Kovic
in Born on the Fourth of July. All
I keep thinking is, “No, please
don’t do this.”

I grew up listening to the Doors.
I still remember riding in my
mom's car listening to Light my
Fire, with my little voice chirping
in on the chorus. That was before
I knew anything about Morrison
and his “tragic” life.

_ When you grow up, you learn
that people do certain things to

get by in the world; Morrison
sang, and Stone brought situ-
ations out into the light with
major movie lal)els backing his
work.

Maybe Stone really does re-

vere Morrison, but if he really
felt as if he lenew him (and I
assume that his sources on
Morrison are the same books
and records that the rest of us
have), then he wouldn’t be doing
this film. Simply, Morrison left

the public arena because he,
didn’t want his personal life to

be picked at like old bread by
city pigeons. l le seemed to want
his lyrics, music and poetry to
speak for themselves.

Now Stone, who is suppos-
edly using glamour—boy Val
Kilmer to play the role of Morri-
son, thinks he's doing some-
body a favor by bringing up
Morrison's life again for public
scrutiny.

What will you do, Mr. Stone?
I-‘ictionalize some steamy love
scenes between him and his
witch wife? Go into his mind
during an LSD trip and find out
that he really did want to sleep
with his mother? Recreate the
concert in Florida where he
supposedly pulled down his
pants? Will you be vain enough
to know how he really died, or
will you go for the Ilollywood
glitter and make us think he's
still alive (reminiscent of Eddie
and the Cruisers)?

Who’ll be the rest of the band?
Charlie Sheen, Tom Cruise and
maybe, if you're lucky, Willem
Dafoe?

Do you think Jim Morrison
would be ﬂattered, or is this
another way to make some quick
money on the post-Vietnam film
fad?

Do us a favor Mr. Stone, ifyou
must capitalize on someone, do
it on a person that wants his life
affected by your magic touch.

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH‘

Song remains the same as Meyes switchs roles

' By Sean Heilman

Staff Writer

Bill Meyers was hired to be
Hackett’s offensive
coordinator this season. He has
several dilemmas facing him
during this spring practice,
including rebuilding an offensive
line which lost three starters and
helping to plan an offense which
will be effective next season.

Meyers has been Pitt’s
offensive-line coach for the past
three seasons. His role with the
offense was expanded when
Hackett, who was offensive
coordinator lastseason, was hired
as head coach.

“Paul will still be very involved
with the offense. He will call the
plays,” said Meyers. “He is still
running the offense.”

Hackett will not be with the
offense at all times, since he is
now head coach. That is where
Meyers’ new role comes into play.

“There are going to be times
when he is pulled away from
things. Iwillcoordinate meetings

and ensure that everyone is ready .

for practice. I will make sure
everyone is on the same page
when he is absent,” Meyers said.
The offense will basically run
under the same system it used
before Hackett was moved to
head coach, Meyers said. The
game plan and everyone’s roles
will be the same for the most part
because the team feels
comfortable with the way the
offense was handled last season.
- Meyers has worked with top
professional and college players
in his first 16 seasons as a coach.
He began his coaching career in
1974 as defensive coordinator at
Santa Clara. He moved on to
coach the offensive lines of
Califomia-Berkeley (1977-78) and
Notre Dame (1979-81).
He made his professional

. ‘coaching debut in 1982 as
offensive-line coach _for Bart

Starr’s Green Bay Packers. In 1984,
he coached Mike Webster and
the Steelers’ offensive line to the
AFC championship game.

From there, he moved on to

Missouri, where he was assistant
head coach and offensive
coordinator for two seasons
before coming to Pitt.

He played his college ball at
Stanford, where he was a starting
tackle on consecutive Pac-8 and
Rose Bowl champion teams
before graduating in 1972.

Some prominent linemen
Meyers has coached who are
currently in the NFL include Tom
Ricketts (Steelers), Mark Stepnoski
(Cowboys), Larry McCarren
(Packers), Tom Thayer (Bears)
and John Clay (Chargers). 1

At Missouri, his only other stint
as offensive coordinator, there

.was not nearly as sophisticated

an offense as Pitt has now.
“The [offensive] system we use
here‘ is more of a pro style. At

Missouri, we didn't have the. I

people to suit a pro system. We
used the I formation and ran a lot
of power- and option-style
running.”

A problem he faces this spring
is replacing" the entire 1989
offensive line, which was lost to
graduation. Pitt recruited seven
offensive linemen for the
upcoming season, five out of
high school and two from junior
college.

“It’s like any other situation

where things work in cycles."

Three years ago, we started with
that group of guys. Now, we’re
starting with a new group. It will
be competitive. We will line them
up and see who does the job.”

Vt/omens gymnastics ena’s season at Ohio State University

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

our floor routines.

“Our scores were a tenth lower then

The lady Panther gymnastics team ended
its 1989-90 season last Saturday, after
placing sixth at the Northeast National
Collegiate Athletic Association Regional
Championships held at Ohio State
University. “I was really pleased with our
performance, ” said Pitt head coach Debbie
Yohman. The Panthers posted a final
score of 180.825.

The Lady Panthers started the
competition with the floor exercises and
placed fifth with a score of 45.85 and an
average of 9.17.

“Our ﬂoors were excellent,” said
Yohman. "We received a lot of
compliments from the other teams about

usual, but that was because we were the
first team up,” added Yohman. “Realistically
looking at the floor, there were some
errors, but the scores were tight overall."

High scores for the Panthers came from
Tina Taylor (9.40), Karenjorgensen (9.35),
Gina Venezia (9.10), Kristen Brown (9.05)
and Kathy Wallish (8.95).

From the floor exercises, the Lady
Panthers moved over to the vault for their
second event. _

“Vaulting is probably our weakest event
level-wise,” said Pitt assistant coach Ben
Rovee. “The vaults we do you really can't
mess up.”

The Lady Panthers took seventh place in
vaulting with a score of 45.45 and an

overall average of 9.09.

For Beth Dyson, who received a 9.35, it
was her highest score ever, and Shelly
Sleith came close to her career high with
a 9.20.

But the Lady Panthers did experience
some difficulties on the vault. Jennifer
Butkovich, who came back last weekend
to score her career high and team-season
high vault of 9.40, after being out of the
Lady Panther line-up for a month, strained
her leg. Butkovich landed face down on
both of her vaults to score an 8.35.

“Jen did not have enough rotation on
both of her vaults,” said Yohman.

Other high scores for the Lady Panthers
came from Venezia (9.05), Taylor (9.00)
and Wallish (8.85).

The Lady Panthers moved to the uneven

parallel bars for their third event.

“We did really well on three events and
had some trouble warming up on bars,”
said Yohman.

The Lady Panthers had to adjust to a
new set of bars:

bars. Both Rovee and Yohman said that
the Speith bars are slower and springier
than the bars that Pitt uses.

The Lady Panthers placed seventh with
a score of 43.70 and an overall average of
8.74. The highest bar score came from
senior Hope Celani, who was placed in
the line-up as a substitute for Robyn
Borchers because of shoulder problems.

“Robyn’s shoulders were weak, and shé
was having some trouble because of them,

were ‘ehh,’ and some were really
good. Now it’s really good, so no

Thing o/‘Beauty, the Sun’s latest
release on SST, is a double LP
filled with the witty cacophony
that the band has staked its
reputation on. As Outrageous-as
many Of the songs may seem,
there’s a great deal of intelligence
behind them. That, combined
with the Sun’s vested interest in
dadaism and grungy tunes, gives
the equation for the Sun’s music.

“We all hold sort Of modernist
ideals, I guess,” says Klieler. “It
has a lot to do with a sort Of
‘anything goes’ kind Of attitude.
Our stuffcan be radically different
from one song tO the next.”

Different it is. Each song On
Thing of Beauty is a testament to
the Suns’ diversity and the efforts
Of its members to not confine
themselves to one particular style.

Double albums are usually a
forced project, with shortage Of
material being the biggest
problem. "

“It wasn’t a conscious thing,”
says Klieler. “When we went in,
we didn’t plan on coming out
with a double LP. 1 think overall,
there was a concept Of ‘let’s just
get all this material Out. Let’s
make it as big a barrage as
possible.’ “

The Volcano Suns are currently
touring the East Coast in support
of Thing ofBeauty. “The last tour
we did, we toured with Roger’
Miller,” says Klieler. “This time,
we’re probably going to end up
playing with a lot Of local bands.”

The «Volcano Suns will be
performing with the Clarlas and
the Cure Experience on Easter
Sunday, April 15, at the Upstage
Lounge. Showtime is 8 pm. Get
there early to shoot the breeze

Mystery Train steams its way

By Rich Turgeon
Staff Writer

Although this 110-minute film
isn’t the most exciting or even
thought-provoking piece of work
I’ve ever seen, and although
screenwriter/directorjimjarmush
seems to think “it is (as he forces
us to sit through endless scenes
of his characters walking down
deserted streets and to listen to
Elvis’s “Blue Moon” three times
in its entirety), Mystery Train is
one of those rare movies that

strangely gets better after you i

leave the theater and it settles in
the memory.

Getting past }armush’s
pretentious and overbearing
obsession with pop icons and
affection for the banal isn’t easy;

movies dealing with “real people” '

and about “real life” have always
been tough to watch for their
sense of self-importance and
uninteresting normalcy.

But something here works, and
it has more to do with the
atmosphere of optimism, affection
and subtle charm that Jarmush
creates than clever writing and
funky, off-beat casting choices.

Mystery Train is actually three
stories told separately, each

“ASKUS

eventually taking place on the
same night and in the same hotel
in Memphis, Tenn.

The first story deals with two
Japanese teenagers who search
Memphis for the past of Elvis and
Carl Perkins, and symbolically,
themselves as well. Wow.
Although it has its quiet moments
of wit, you’ll find a more satisfying
“coming of age” tale in Stand by
Me. Its unconventionality is
appealing at first, and the two
young actors in the roles ooze
charisma, but it’s not enough to
generate much interest after 10
minutes or so.

The second story is a complete

dud, that of a recently widowed"

Italian beauty who has a
conversation with a man in a
diner who has supposedly seen
Elvis’s ghost. She sees or dreams
about Elvis’s ghost that night, and
in a triumphant act of courage,
takes off her wedding ring in an
action that signifies divine
enlightenment and cries, “Life
goes on!”

The third story is by far the
most involving but features the
film’s worst actors. In this final
tale, an English factory worker
(adequately portrayed by ex-
Clash member Joe Strummer)
drunkenly totes a revolver in a
bar, as his friends watch with
concern. Needless to say,
someone gets shot, and the story
degenerates into an episode of
The Three Slosbed Stooges.

l’ve never seen a fi1m’s“world"
captured so lovingly as Memphis
in Mystery Train, and the set
design is as equally intriguing as
the city exteriors. jarmush
admirably takes chances in his
casting, story and concept; it’s
his 8elf—indulgent, tedious
execution and assumption that
we’ll care about these zombies
that makes his film hard to watch.

Mystery Train is a likable,
original oddity, like a weird
animal at the zoo, but you can
onlyiwatch it for so long before
moving on to the turkeys.

KRS—1 of Boogie Down Productions speaks at Pitt

Through the sponorship of the
Blade Action Society, KRS— I of
Boogie Down Productions spolee
at the University of Pittsburgh on
Apn'l5 and addressed a variety of
social issues concerning the world
we live in.

The following dialogue is taleen

from an interview that Tony Scott
of WP’/S-FM conducted after the
speech.

 

Your name is Kris Parker,
but everyone calls you KRS—1.
Could you elaborate [on] what
that means?

That means knowledge reigns
supreme over nearly everyone
nearly everyone. ‘Cause
ignorance rules a lot of us. But I
chose that name.  I think all of
us should choose one name other
than the one given to us because
these are slave names. Either you

 

call yourself Kris X or KRS-1.

In your topic for your lecture
tonight, you spoke on re-
evolution of the mind. Could
you elaborate a little more on
that for our listeners [and
readers] out there?

Well, logically speaking,
everything the black race has
gotten in this country, they've
gotten through shedding their
blood. Everything. Everything —-

from sitting in a five—and-dime
bookstore to sitting on the bus, to
going to school, to anything —-
we had to shed our blood for it.
So, we have to realize that we’ll
never be free until Africa is free.
And we should shed our blood
one more time to free ourselves
once and for all and take Africa
back. Just ask yourself the
question: why are there no African
cars? You got European cars, you
got German cars, you got French
cars, you got Japanese cars,
American cars —— no African cars.
We’re not competing in the world
enterprise or the world
commercialism or world
capitalism, for that matter, and
that needs to stop. That needs to
end.

You talk about the black man
retaking Africa and goingback
to Africa. Where in Africa do
you suggest that the black man
go? How do you suggest that
he [get] there? And do you have
a timetable for taking care of
all of this or a certain time by
which it should be done?

Number one, where in Africa is
the entire continent — all of it
needs to be Africa for Africans.
Black people need to be in Africa
building Africa. Africa has
everything we need there.
America has nothing at all.
Everything America gets it gets
from outside everything.
[America’s] used up its gold mines;
it’s used up its silver. it’s used up

its oil; it’s used up everything.
Africa continuously replenishes
these things. We need to be there.
How we go about doing that is
through armed revolution. The
freedom fighters in South Africa
have a very good picture on that.
It’s called ‘pick up your nine and
bust shots at the government.’
That's what time of day it is. Until
we realize that that’s the key to
what we have to do to get Africa
back, then, of course, we will
continue to be here in America
and wonder Why we're killed the
most and why we’re in jail the
most. Timetable on this — I say
in the next 50 years. Because a lot
of things are going to change ——
a lotofthings are going to change.
And either you fight for Africa, or
you fight for America. Or should
I say that you ﬁght for your
people or fight for the
slavemaster.

Getting back to the point of
reuniting the black
community and retaking
Africa, there might be some
people——-black peop1e——-who
aren’t really down with that.
For example, there are a lot of
things here in America that
many of us take for granted
that aren’t available in Africa.
Manytechnological advances,
such as things that help us
cook, that help us bathe and
that help us live our
comfortable lives on whatever

We Sljgt T Iarougla Art School exhibit

 _  F ’ ,» “ Bystevelieineman
, I V 0' :_, 1‘  __ Staff Writer

If local sculptors Amy Nolan,
Alison Safford and Chris Wassil
really slept through art school
like they say, it must have been
due to the long nights they’ve
spent laboring over the variety of
artwork featured in their show,
“We Slept Through Art School,”
which opened April 7 at the Why
Not Etna gallery.

The gallery gives you an
opportunity to see work by many
young, talented artists who,
despite an apparent boom in
gallery space, are seldom heard
from in the city. In particular,
you’re more likely to see work
by women artists at Why Not
Etna.

The well—lit, high—ceilinged
main room is perfect for NoIan’s
larger pieces, which are often
muddled by space problems. Her
two largest ceramic sculptures
are a pair (though by no means
a set) of 8—foot—high archways
. placed at opposite ends of the

room. They are the prime
examples of her interest in
anthropology and the architecture
of old South American cultures
(the title of one, "I Dated an
Anthro Major,” is as far as she goes
in naming her sources).

Chris Wassil works with various
media, mainly found metal objects.
Most striking are her metallic
human ﬁgures, familiar parts and
household items as parts of the
anatomy. Although the
combination of metalwork and
found materials is not graphic in a
realistic sense, its suggestion of
mutilation and mutation is still
unsettling.

Alison Safford’s work may not
seem as dazzling but is
immediately richer in narrative
content. There is almost always
some arresting contrast, like the
piece in which a bird’s nest rests
inside a fortress of spikes. Or the
fact that, upon close examination,
the cascading leaves and vines of
untitled pieces are really
meticulous metal facsimiles. Once
you’re that close, you are forced

10% too much for Pittsburgh's ‘Amusement Tax’

By Tim Azinger
Showcase Editor

People in the entertainment
business don’t find Pittsburgh's
“amusement tax” very amusing.

For 22 years, the city of
Pittsburgh has been collecting 10
percent of the revenue that local

—entertainment pl'Ol'l'10[€I'S earn

from any “amusement” function
—— a concert, sporting event,
movie or play — within the
Pittsburgh city limits.

The tax was adopted on Dec.
22, 1967 and became effective for
the 1968 fiscal year. According to
th_e tax law, producers of
“amusement functions” are
required to pay the percentage
on a monthly basis to the city
treasurer. All late taxes are
assessed a 1- percent—per-month
interest charge. Refusal to pay
the tax will result in the treasurer

tacking on ‘ an additional 10
percent.
Many cities, such as

Philadelphia, don’t tax the arts,

and the ones that do, charge less,
and more appropriate amounts
of money.

According to Richard Fees,
assistant director of taxes, the
money from the amusement tax
is used for “general revenue,
purposes.” Fees also stated that
money is allocated to particular
groups involved with the arts.

“There are other cities that have
a tax,” said Rich Engler, co—owner
of DiCe_sare Engler Productions
Inc., “but most of them have
much lower rates, around 2 or 3
percent.”

“It’s a thorn in all lpromoters’l
sides,” said Norman Veenstra of
Stormfront Bookings, a local
independent promoter. “I
understand why it’s there. The
city needs a certain amount of
revenue; it’s just that 10 percent is
high. That’s just another chunk I
have to take out of my earnings.”

While independent promoters
take the percentage from their
totallearnings (which often means
a loss), the larger promoters are

able to figure the 10 percent into
their profit allowance. For this
reason, pricesfor larger events in
Pittsburgh are often higher.
Along with paying higher ticket
prices, fans also suffer in another
way —— many acts are reluctant to
perform in Pittsburgh because
the tax is so high. Although the
Rolling Stones and Paul
McCartney played here in the
past year, both acts bypassed
Pittsburgh on their previous tours.
“Everybody will come around
sooner or later,” said Engler, “but
the people of Pittsburgh lose out.
There would be a lot more shows
if we didn’t have [the tax].
“Bands like to play all the major
cities in the country. Pittsburgh is
one of them, but if they can play
in [another city] and make $50,000
more, then they will.”
People have voiced enough

‘disapproval over the tax that

Mayor Sophie Masloff included
efforts to reduce or eliminate the
tax as part of her platform in last
year ‘s mayoral election.

According to Eric Feder,
administrative assistant to District
8 council member Dan Cohen,
Masloff spoke of taking Mario
Lemieux and Andy Van Slyke to

Harrisburg with her to lobby the '

state. Act 511, allows
municipalities to levy taxes.

“The rates can be set by the
municipality,” said Fees. “[Masloffl
was aiming her attack at changing
the tax laws”.

“Mayor Masloff hasn’t talked
about cutting the tax, just possibly

reducing it to 5 or 7.5 percent," _

said Feder. “The city can’t make
any changes until they do the
budget each year, so changes
can’t be made until November.”

Ben Hayllar,. city finance
director, was notavailable for
comment.

To avoid the tax, promoters
will often hold smaller functions

outside the city limits. Now, larger .

shows will have a tax—free venue,
at least during the summer months
with the advent of the Star Lake

Amphitheater, located at the
intersection of routes 22 and 18
in Washington County.

The 20,000—seat amphitheater

(7,000 reserved seats and 13,000 

additional _seats on the
surrounding slopes) will host
events from June through
September. Billy Joel will be the
premier act on June 17.

do you tell him to go back to

he ever wanted right here?
Well, there’s two levels to that.
Matter of fact, it’s more than that.
Number one, how do we know
that Africa won’t have all those
things? Number two, all of the
things that we have here that

a sickness called amnesia that
these people are suffering from.
They’ve forgotten where they’ve
come from, so here looks like
home.

I want to run Africa. I don’t
want to run America. Eventually,
lI’ll build my house in Africa. I
don’t want to build no house

A lot of What you said
tonight, I can easily see 
being not printed in the press
or misrepresented
especially the statement about
Satan being a tall European.
Would you like to clarify
yourself on that now?

Well, what I said originally is
that Satan is not a little red man
with horns that lives under the
ground; he’s a tall European. And
I say that because we can look at
it from a logical point of view.
Number one, the characteristic of
Satan is death. The characteristic
of the creator is life. Those that
wish to destroy life are speaking

of the characteristics of Satan.
Those that live and walk in death
are living and walking and
breathing in the characteristics of

, Satan.

One small question I would
have for the criminals in action -
the CIA.  You have two laws
you’ve got to go by in this country.

One is “Thou shall not kill.” The

other one is the CIA. Now, only
Satan would put his law above
the law of God.‘Only Satan would
test the respect of the creator -——,
only Satan. And this is why I say
Satan is a tall European. At this
time, Satan is a tall European
because it is the tall Europeans in

government, that wish to decide
on death penalties, when the Ten
Commandments clearly say,
’Thou shall not kill.’ There’s no
lawyer that can misconstrue. that.
There’s no debate.  But what
they do is they take their law, and
they place it above thelaw of
God.  That’s why I say this
government is demonic and Satan
is a tall European. And if this
country was run by black people,
I would say, ‘Satan is a tallAfrican.’
But it’s clearly not [run] by black

people. It’s [run] by the European. ,

And if you're going to run this
