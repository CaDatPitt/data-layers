Julian Bond Traces History

JULIAN BOND
Georgian Legislator

by ALAN DISLER

Julian Bond, twice -barred
Negro Georgia legislator,
spoke to a capacity audience
concerning the political his-
tory of the Civil Rights
Movement Friday night at
Carnegie Lecture Hall, The
sponsors of the lecturewere

the B’nai B’rith Hillel Foun-

dation, Americans for Democratic

,‘ - ‘Action, American Civil. Liberties

Union, and Students for Peace.

Bond was twice denied_ his seat
in the Georgia House of Repre
sentatives on‘ the basis of certain
remarks he made critical of US
policy in Vietnam and the draft.
The Supreme Court in 1966' un-
animously decided against the
Georgia legislature's action of re-
stricting “the right of legislators
to dissent from the national or
state policy.” ‘

  

For the purposes of discussion,
Bond set the beginning of the
Civil Rights Movement at 1960.
That year “was important for
two reasons,” he said. That year
signaled the “introduction of

ment. “The Civil Rights Move-
ment began to be ‘democratizedj
not that it was undemocratic be-
fore, but that it was a limited
gathering.” Bond stated that up

who were involved in litigation
or businessmen who made lots
of money and gave it to lawyers
who were involved in litigation.”

Bond continued, saying, “The
student participation began in
Greensboro on Feb. 1, 1960,” with
the first sit-ins. This “opened the
door to participation” of young
and old, whitm and Negroes “who
otherwise had no opportunity to
participate in the Civil Rights
Moveinen .”

Bond traced what he termed
“escalation of goals and manpow-
er” ' in Civil Rights, citing the
case of the CORE-‘sponsored Free-
dom Ride, in 1961, which con-
tinued the newly-conceived no-
tion of outside participation of
local race problems.

Bond related the problem of
Lawrence County, Ala., in which
Negroes comprise 81 per cent
of the population. After a voter
registration drive, Negroes were
faced with the problem of what
to do with their newly- acquired
power. In Macon County, in which
Negroes comprise 76’ per cent of
the population, the solution work-

ed out, was termed “party poli-

should occuply public offices in
proportion to their representation
in the population. '
This -was modiﬁed, however,

since most Negroes never held’

office and they also did not want
to “frighten whites,” and they
ended up occupying only 10 per
cent of the public offices of the
county. ‘

In Lawrence County, however, .

the View was that since the

The University calendar for the

period will last from April 10-11,
with the ﬁnal exam week re-
scheded for April 12-18.

by ROBERT ZAVOS

. After Auschwitz: Essays in_Con-
temporary Judaism by Dr.‘Rich-
7 ard L. Rubenstein is at once the
 -saddest and wisest theological
 work of this century. Dr. Ru-.
 benstein is one of the few theo-
; 'j_logi_ans who is aware of the trag-
 ic _nature of man and the ulti-
‘il. .n1ate indifference of the cosmos.

P In Chapter 12, “The Making of

sophy quite beautifully when he
- writes, “I found‘ it impossible to
- ' believe in a providential God. I
3 -7}:-elieved that when I died the
whole world of my experience
 would disappear with me. My
L: .world would last only as long as
I . ‘I did. It" would then disappear as
-if it had never been. I was con-
: vinced that I had arisen out of
nothing and was destined to re-
. turn to nothingness. . . . Nothing
 in the bleak, cold, unfeeling uni-
‘' verse was remotely concerned
with human aspiration and long-
t1“ing.”
 While this theme is_not new to
_20th century literature or philo-
esophy, it does strike a blow to
;traditional religion and Sunday
"School teaching. It leads natural-
fly to the question which Dr. Ru-
__benstein asks, “If existence is
..ultimately devoid of hope and
_-God offers us_absolutely nothing,
=.why bother with religion at all?”
_f ‘ ‘He answers this crucial question
 many places in his essays. In
[_“The‘ Meaning“ of Torah in Con-
temporary Jewish Theology,” he
states, “It is precisely the ulti-
'_m_.atel hopelessness and gratuity
of _our human situation which
‘calls forth our strongest need for
"religious -community. If all we
have is one another, then as-
'_::-suredly we need one another
{more than ever.”
u ‘He ' stresses the psychological
‘heed for religion in Chapter 5,
V" “Atonement and Sacriﬁce in Con-
temporary Jewish Liturgy.” He-
»-explains that “through communal
ltlenfession and acknowledgment
‘f’ ‘guilt, the penitent is assured
that his --is the shared predica-
_.ment of mankind.” While he
’;,acknowledges that‘ the problem

 a Rabbi,” he expresses his philo- -

“After Auschwitz”

of guilt is not solved, it becomes
a common concern and helps to.
unite the community.

He relates Sigmund Freud's In-
terpretation of Dreams to many
of the apparently irrational as-_
pects of religion. Just as appar-
ently absurd dreams reveal deep
emotions and desires, so do re-
ligious ceremonies reﬂect the
fears, aspirations, and yearnings
of the individual and the group.

Furthermore, religious cere-
monies dramatize ethical and
moral teachings and often pos-
sess a deﬁnite survival value for
the community. At this point, a
serious and reflective reader
might say that an atheist with a
humanistic orientation could have

ethical and moral‘ values. This is

exactly where Dr. Rubenstein’s
wisdom is apparent.

In Chapter 3, “Person and Myth
in the Judaeo—Christian Encoun-
ter,” Dr. Rubenstein explains his
disenchantment with a secular
society. Our growing technologic-
al society with its increased spe-_
cialization of labor and character-
istic anonymity of workers is re-
sulting in a depersonalized, de-
humanized society. ‘

Throughout his book runs the
realization that man and society
will always exhibit characteristic-
ﬂaws. His ﬁrst chapter, “Religion
and the Origins. of the Death
Camps,” cites strong evidence
that man's inhumanity to man
will never end. The most inhu-
man crime in the entire" history
of mankind ended just over two-
decades ago. (Even this very mi-
nute , men die half way around
the world in the name of
“causes.”)

More than anything else, Dr.
Rubenstein is a realist.- He is
aware of what man is and what
man will always be. The title of
his book explains his insight. Af-
ter the death camps how can any
human being conceive anything
other than the fact that we live
“in a cold, silent, cosmos.”

His insights into religion are
something that no Jew, Christian,
or Athetist should miss.

Grades a. Success

Do Not Correlate

WASHINGTON (CPS) —
There seems to be no direct
relationship b e tw e e 11 high
grades in college and profes-
sional success in later life,
two recent studies indicate.
Dr. Eli Ginzberg, a New York
researcher, studied a group of

Columbia University graduate stu-
dents who had won fellowships

to the school between 1944 and _

1950.» Ginzberg’s task was to ﬁnd
out how successful the 342 stu-
dents had become 14 years after
they completed their fellowships.

The ﬁndings showed students
who had graduated from college
with honors who had won schol-
astic medals or who had been
elected to Phi Beta Kappa Were
more likely to be in the “lower
professional performance levels”
than students ‘who had not dis-
tinguished themselves while in
college.

In another survey, a team of
University of Utah professors
found there is almost no relation-
ship between the grades of medi-
cal student gets and his later per-
formance.

This ﬁnding started the leader
of the research team, ‘Dr. Phillip

Pre-Medstudents
Hold Symposium

Alpha Epsilon Delta, honorary
pre-medical society, is present-
ing its second armual “Pathways
to the Profession” symposium to-
night at 6:30 p.m. in the main
auditorium of the Graduate School
of Public Health building. The
purpose of the symposium is
to orient the premedicalstudent
to the problems and procedures
of acquiring a medical education.
The speakers will be Dr. Samuel
Harrison, associate dean of the
University Medical School; Dr.
Benjamin Haseltine, advisor to
all pre-med students; Louis Cata-
lane, a fourth year medical stu-
dent; and Rodger Blair, a second
year medical student. Following
the speeches, guests will have an
opportunity to ask questions.

‘B. Price. He called it a “shock-
ing ﬁnding to a medical educa-
tor like myself who has spent his
professional life selecting appli-
cants for admission to medical
school.

He added that the study caused
him to question the adequacy of
grades not only in selecting those
who should be admitted to med-
ical school but also in measuring
a student’s progress.

There are numerous theories at-
tempting to explain these sur-
prising ﬁndings. The most com-

’ mon one affirms that the over-

emphasis on grades which begins
when a student is in junior high
and continues throughout his aca-
demic career tends to destroy
interest’ in learning for its own
sake.

John Holt, an educator and au-
thor of “Why Children Fail,” ob-
serves that current school meth-
ods destroy love of learning by
encouraging students to work for
petty rewards—names on honor
rolls, gold stafs, for the “ignoble
satisfaction of feeling they are
better than someone else.”

Slow Reader I’

A noted publisher in Chicago
reports there is a simple tech-
nique of rapid reading which
should enable you to double
your reading speed and yet re-
tain much more. Most people
do not realize how much they
could increase their pleasure,
success and income by. reading
faster and more accurately.

According to this publisher,
anyone, regardless of his pres-
ent reading skill, can use this
simple technique to improve
his reading. ability to 21 remark-
able degree. VVhether reading
stories, books, technical matter,
it becomes possible to read sen-
tences at a glance and entire
pages in seconds with this
method.

To acquaint the readers of
this newspaper with the easy-
to-follow rules for developing
rapid reading skill, the com-
pany has printed full details of
its interesting self—training
method in a new booklet, “How
to Read Faster and Retain
More,” mailed free. No obliga-

a page was printed in The Pitts-

didn’t do too much cheering at
-V the West Virginia game on Jan.
"18 and that they also arrived
] late. At half time, Dean Billick
- told them, “If you can’t show up
ten minutes early, we don’t want
you here.” Later that week there
 was a letter in the Pitt News com-
’ menting on the lack of activity
 by the cheerleaders. The next
‘game, Virginia Tech on Jan. 23,
F-the cheerleaders didn’t show up
[at all. Dean Billick apparently

it " turned out that they were
otherwise occupied that night.
Their excuses had a ring of
monotony: “Sorority,” “Fraterni-
ty.” At most colleges and uni-
versities, “Sorority” and “Fra-
ternity” are excuses for attend-
ing basketball games, but here at
Pitt they’re not only excuses for
students not attending games but
V -also for cheerleaders missing
A them. At most colleges and uni-
versities fraternities and soror-

cheering lifts the roof. Here at
Pitt, the stands are empty and
it is quiet, very quiet.

‘ ‘, In the article, one of the cheer-
leaders defended herself by stat-
ing that they are allowed only
one cut and if they take any
more there is a fine. At most high
, schools, competition for cheer-
...leading is so strong that there
are not only separate‘ cheerlead-

but there is a pep club for those
who didn’t make cheerleader. If
one cheerleader misses a game
there is not a 15 cent ﬁne but
rather dismissal. The missing
’ cheerleader is quickly replaced
by a JV cheerleader or someone
 from the pep club. Pitt could
‘stand to take a few lessons from
some high schools.

tried out for cheerleading and

like either the competition was
poor‘ or someone has things sew-

Letters to the Editor

article that they practice their
routines _a month and a half.
Members of the band tell me that
the cheerleaders haven’t had a
new routine in two years and be-
sides how long do you have "to
practice just to yell, “Let’s Go
Pitt”?

The cheerleaders say, “You
can’t ‘cheer to 500 uninterested
people,” and that when they get
up to cheer, people tell them to
sit down. If the crowd cheered
easily there wouldn’t be any
need for cheerleaders. The job of
the cheerleader is to get the peo-
ple to cheer; and this usually
means ﬁghting and yelling and
almost forcing students to cheer.
And if you ﬁght hard enough and
long enough you’ll win a couple
of converts and since spirit is
contagious it will not be long un-
til you have a good cheering sec-
tion week after week. This trans-
forrnation won't happen in a
week. It may not even happen
in a season but if enough people
work hard enough it will happen
and the results are well worth
the work and wait. Carnegie
Tech students have “identity,”
how about Pitt?

As for the students who tell‘

the cheerleaders to sit down, I
suggest that if they don’t want
to be bothered, they should sit
on the other side, of the Field
House.

The article quoted one of the
cheerleaders as saying, “You canit
blame the students. Not when

' the team is losing by 40 points.”

I say you’re not going to have a
winning team unless you have
an enthusiastic student body. The
students cheering can be that
extra bit to get the team on the
winning rack and keep them
there. Anyone can cheer when
the team' is winning, but it takes
guts and school spirit to cheer
when they are losing. '

As for the students who ﬁnd
cheering distracting, it should
be noted that a good cheering
section makes the players try
harder and results in a better
game. How hard is a player go-
ing to try when the-team is los-
ing _by 40 points and the students
are sleeping.

The article pointed out that
the Panther will not be able to
appear at the games because the
Athletic Department has stored
away his uniform. Dave I-Iart

wouldn’t have tolerated this, why‘

care one way or the other, some disgruntled’ students were heard com-
plaining that they may get finished with their finals two days later than
they expected. ,

But such a reaction should not come as a surprise to anyone. The
reading period is something that is needed at any good institution of higher
learning. But all too many students at Pitt have never learned to use it
effectively. Some resident students go home over the reading period break
rather than remaining at the‘University tostudy.

The efforts of the student leaders and the members of the admini-
stration should not be to no avail. The idea of a study period before ﬁnals
has been in practice for several years at some of the finest schools in the
country. There has been some discussion that perhaps we should spread
finals over two weeks intermingling study days with examinations,

  Period

 

If such innovations are to come to the University then the enthusi-
asm of a few student leaders for these changes must be spread throughout
the student body.

No one should «have to preach to the student body about the advant-

ages of such innovations. Anyone interested in producing the best possible

academic record should welcome the reading period. It is rather dismal to
think that the majority of students do not relish these additional two days.

But hopefully if it is maintained or broadened (as is expected) perhaps the

Free University in Free Society  

by Frank Couvares

“A free university‘ in a
free society” is a concept
which includes an enormous
amount of signiﬁcance. It
contains the idea that an
academic community must be
the place in which freedom
of thought, of expression,
and of intellectual experi-
mentation are exercised to
their fullest extent. It im-
plies the processes of growth,
maturation, and identiﬁca-
tion.

IT CERTAINLY implies
the freedom of the individ-
ual student to participate in,
and adopt for the ﬁrst time
as an integral part of his ex-
istence, an education in hu-
manity. And it means that
for an. unfortunately, but

‘necessarily brief time the in-

dividual as student may live
these experiences intensely,
absorbedly, and most impor-
tant, unrestricted.

The concept of academic
freedom can in no way be de-

‘ﬁned so as to include the

present activities of the
House UnAmerican Activ-
ities Committee. The commit-
tee’s behaviours is, in fact,
representative of a concept
so different from academic
freedom as to be contradic-
tory. It is this contradiction

which America must resolve. '

If our academic communities
are to produce mature, vi-
brant, and critical intellects,
then the conﬂict must be re.

players. Ask our team. Just get-
ting a response from the crowd
isn’t everything. We do this more
for the team than to have peo-
ple look at us from the stands.”
I hope the team appreciates it
because the students surely don’t
care.

B_ut let's take her advice. Let's
hear from the basketball and
football players, the sororities and
fraternities, Dean Billick and Bob
Timrnons, the Pitt Band and the
cheerleaders. And most impor-
tantly let’s hear from the stu-
dents.~ .

Let’s get some constructive cri-

ticism and new ideas. Let's start"

some changes, and stop this farce

 

The

solved in favor of academic
freedom.

THE PROBLEM can be
confronted simply by reduc-
ing it to two questions. First,
is the response to the sup-
posed dangers of campus po-
litical organizations a rea-
so'nable one or an excessive
one? And second, are the ef-
fects of limiting academic

freedom, and all the implica-I ‘

tions contained within the
concept, ever justiﬁably out-
weighed by current political
contingencies? That these
questions have not been an-
swered, and the conflict re-.
solved, is incredible,

Can the activities of Rep.
Pool beregarded as anything
but excessive? The obvious
disproportion between the
supposed potential danger of
the campus groups and the
manner in which the com-
mittee responded to that po-
tential well enough answers
the ﬁrst question. The sec-
ond and more profound ques-
tion must be answered on
the basis of the American
nation’s committment‘ to its

liberal ideology. If, indeed, .

the existence of critical
minds, the ability to reeval-

_uate and revise, the oppor-

tunity to attain s_elf-expres-
sion, are values of the Amer-
ican people, then political
contingencies can never be
allowed to stiﬂe the cultiva-
tion of such valuable commo-
dities.

THAT THE American pub-
he has not been able to
comprehend the import of

 

HUAC’s activities is unfor-
tunate. That the academic
community (especially stu-
dents) should not immedi-
ately recognize the serious-
ness of the issue, and resolve
the contradiction inherent in
it, is unthinkable.

Educational administra-
tors, academicians, and‘ stu-
dents must acknowledge the
threat to academic freedom
and assert the necessity for
a free university in which
interchange of ideas is un-
hindered and free-wheeling.
There should be no uncer-
tainly as to the response war-
ranted by the activities of
HUAC.

A body possessing no ju-
dicial perogatives should

should not be allowed to har— .

rass_ members of the aca-
demic community, nor to
crucify individuals on the

_basis of intellectual commit-

ments, nor ever to impede
the education in humanity

“Two for the Seesaw”  

by CHARLES REINER
Two for the Seesaw, a supposed comedy with a mes-
sage, opened at the Pittsburgh Playhouse last Friday night.
The play, with a cast of two, a la, Owl and the Pussy-
cat, concerns-Jerry, (Barton Heyman), a thirty-four year
old gentile attorney and Gittel (Carolle Campbell), a twen-
ty-nine year old Jewess with a bronx accent. Jerry is run,-

ning away from two crutches—-
his wife and -father-in-law, while
Gittel, with two ulcers, seems to
have beenla leaning post for most
of her life.

This potentially perfect couple
spent eight happy months and
one unhappy ulcer together until
Jerry decides to start living -and
stop leaning. After making this
“climatic” decision, he leaves for
Nebraska from where he has re-

cently escaped. As for the mes-
sage of this play, after Jerry has
gone, Gittel realizes, “It was bet-
ter to have loved and lost than
not have loved at all.”

er AidTonight 

by JAY ROSENSTEIN, Assistant sports Editor i
Whenever Coach Bucky Waters has to find a quick

remedy to get ‘his West Virginia basketball team winning
again, the schedule alwaysseems to enable the Panthers to

provide it.

The two squads meet tonight in Morgantown to com-

plete this season’s home and home series. In the game
played at the Field House, the Mountaineers crushed the cagers, 102-78.
WVU had lost three of its last four before they faced the Panthers.
After the easy victory, West Virginia won three of its next four,
losing only a two point squeaker at Penn State. I
But Saturday night Duke caught the Mountaineers, 91-75, to bring
WVU’s record to 11-6. Coach Waters will once again count on the

Panthers to set his club straight.

I Cager coach Bob Timmons indicated that he’ll have his team play
ball control, realizing the futility of running with West Virginia’s speed-
sters. “We’ll try to slow up their game as much as we can,” he_ said.
‘But we'll need better shooting against their zone than we got against

Fordh am. ’ ’

The Panthers shot 32% Saturday night in losing to Fordham, 68-59
at the‘ Field House. But the Rams didn’t do much better (34%), and

that kept the game close.

The contest‘ was tied eight times, the last. at 38-38 with 8:45 left.
A foul shot by Rich Goggin broke the deadlock, and Bill La.nghe1d’s
steal and layup gave Fordham the momentum to open up a 47-38 lead

that the Panthers couldn’t overcome.

Unfittingly, Langheld’s steal was off Ken Bollens, who played
another exceptional ballgame. Bollens scored 25 points and grabbed

14 rebounds in the same type of effort that earned him a berth on the ‘

all-ECAC team for the week ending Jan. 28.

_ It was Bollens’ five points in twominutese that momentarily brought
the cagers back into the game with three minutes remaining. Coupled
with Len Kalata’s jump shot at 2:19, the gap was narrowed to 54-50.

_ Then an intentional foul on ‘Stan Falenski and a double technical
foul fora minor scuffle highlighted a free throw derby that Fordham
won, 12-5, to put the game out of reach. . H ‘

“We played 32 minutes of good basketball,” sighed'Timmons, “but
not 40. ‘Mistakes killed us those last eight.”

Cub Cagers Beat Point Park

Face West Virginia Tonight

“Wait ’till next year” is the
perennial cry of teams which
lose to a big rival. But, in basket-
ball a team normally gets two
chances, and so for the frosh
cagers, tonight at Morgantown is
their chance to gain revenge
against the Little Mountaineers.

In the ﬁrst game, the Cubs
fell behind in the first half, and
a late rally fell just short. Since

that game, a bad ﬁrst half has‘

become a -pattern for the frosh.

It happened "again Saturday,
when it took a second half rally
and an overtime for the Cubs to
beat,Point Park, 75-68. “I don’t
know whether we just want to
get behind or what,” said a per-
plexed Tim Grgurich, freshman
coach.

After trailing, 41-35, at the
half, the frosh fought back to tie
the game at 62, all with a minute
left. Then a three point play by

Point’s Ron Brown seemed to-
sew it up for the Pioneers, but.
with 0.35 left, Mike Patcher
scored and was fouled. Patcher
sank the foul shot to send the
game into overtime.

Two gjump shots by Dick Has-
singer gave the frosh a 69-68 lead
with 1:11 left, when reserve guard
Bob Brickner was fouled. Brick-
ner made both ends of the one

and one, and then, with Point

Park forced to foul, Brickner and
Bob Petrini each converted two
fouls for the ﬁnal margin.

Bricknerfs performance pleased
Grgurich. “I put him in to see
what he could do under pressure.
This is a year" of learning, and
he can’t- learn sitting on the
bench. He really came through
with the heat on.”

There will be more heat on
tonight at Morgantown.

Fordh—am’s coach John Bach con-

curred. “When a team is losing

consistently,” he said, “you ex-
pect a rash of mistakes some
time during the game. We had

to wait awhile, but sure enough

they came.”

- The Rams, especially Langheld,
seemed content in the ﬁrst half
to gun from 30 or 35 feet, usual-
ly missing the shot. But 19 sec-
onds before intermission, Lang-
held ﬁnally connected on one.

- Fordham turned it into a four-

Point play , when Pat Raftery
made both free throws after be-
ing fouled under the basket. The
result was a 29-29 halftime score
instead of a Panther advantage.

Timmons saw a bit of daylight"
in the 14th loss of the year. “We
were more aggressive,” he noted.
“At least we were defending our-
selves out there."

That's not much to bring into
Morgantown.

MIC.HIGAN’S NCAA heavyweight champion, Dave Porter, shows Toby
H-ensgen what the study of aeronautics might be like. The learning
process is short for Porter pinned Hensgen in 43 seconds.

by ROY JA-COBS
Just bylookingi at the ex-
pressions of the two coaches,
it was hard to tell which

team was winning Satur-

day’s wrestling meet at Trees
Hall.

Michigan’s Cliﬁ Keen remain-
ed so stone-faced most of the af-‘
ternoon, you’d' never know his
wrestlers were completely out-
classing the varsity matmen. And
varsity coach Dave Johnson was
probably hiding the embarrass-
ment his team was causing him
behind his "bland expression.

Afterwards, Johnson seemed as
if he had been prepared for the
30-3 trouncing his team was go-
ing to take because he admitted,
“We won one more than I thought
we would.”

Typical of the varsity’s futil-
ity was Toby Hensgen’s match
at heavyweight against NCAA
champion Dave Porter. It only

_ lasted 43 seconds.

The two heavyweights danced"

brieﬂy, Porter then picked up

Hensgen up over his head, laid
him down gently on the mat,

 

 

Monday, Feb.r.ua_l',y:..6,‘_1967   EWS —— Page O7, _;

cradled him, and pinned him.
And it’s not because Hensgen is
a pushover.

“Porter did the same thing last
year in the national ﬁnals against
a 280-pounder,” said Johnson.
“He always has one or two tough
matches a year, but he wins
tho-se, too.”

The only winner for the wrest-
lers was Al Traunsteiner, who
has now three of his last four
matches after a shaky start this
season. He won his 167-pound

_ match with a 6-3_ decision over

Michigan’s Bill Waterman.
“A1 looked good,” said John-

Traunsteiner Gains Only Win 

son, “but what I can’t understand‘*-’-
is that they switched their 177-

pounder to 167 and he lost, while
the substitute 177-pounder beat

Hoover.” He wasn’t complaining _f.

though. ‘

Traunsteiner had to do some‘;

fancy wrestling in the first per-
iod to avoid several takedowns

by Waterman, then he himself 
got _tWo points for a takedown in 5

the closing seconds of the period.‘
Al reversed Waterman once each

in the last two, periods to oﬁset 

Waterman’s reversal and to cut

his opponent’s riding time advan-I 

tage to one point. -

Peking Professor Criticizes

- The following article by Huang
Ch'ang, associate professor of
physics at Peking University ap-

S - neared in the Chung-kuo Ch’ing-
' nien Pao of Peking on Jan. 25,

1962, under the title “Here and
There at Harvard University.”

I spent several years stu-
dying at Harvard University

V F ‘in the United States. I came

into contact with quite a
number of American univers-
sity students. In my view,
these students have the following

- characteristics:

.1. They ane busy with money
all day long and have no heart

‘ for study. The reason is simple:

tuition is too high, generally be-
yond the ability of the average
student to pay. Over the past ten

_years or more, the school fees

of a private university have

jumped nearly ten-fold! Except

for the children of rich families,
most "students have found it ex-
ceedingly difficult to pay such a

“ big sum for school fees. In order
to make some money, they can-
» not help, as soon as the school
A bell rings to dismiss school, rush-
, ing to various hotels, restaurants,

and coffee houses. to ﬁght for jobs
as dish washers, waiters, baby-
sitters, etc. They often work from
4 o’clock in the afternoon straight

' to midnight; after that they drag

their tired bodies back to their
dormitories. And the wages they

‘ '- get are pitifully small. In res-

taurants near, or even far away

from some universities, universi-
» ty students can often be seen

rushing here and there, scramb-
ling for work.

2. They,do not, or dare not, in-
quire about politics, being afraid
of getting themselves into trou-
ble. As far as politics is concern-
ed, it can be said, American
university students are ignorant
in the extreme. They do not
know who Marx was or what the
world situation is like. Further-
more, they basically do not dare
to inquire about politics. The
United States is .a country full of
secret agents. There, political
persecution is perpetrated in an
endless stream. Whoever utters
the slightest sound of discontent
is immediately suspected as a
Communist. In that country a
student, once tinged with “red,”
is unable to continue his studies
—much less, to graduate. His rel-
atives and friends will keep away
from him. His fate is thus sealed!

As far as I know, at Harvard
University there is no progressive
activity among the students. Some
Chinese students once held a

gathering of a purely friendly’

character, but immediately after-
wards the immigration bureau
found out who had attended the
meeting and had them ﬁnger-

printed, interrogate, voice-record-
ed, and warned not to hold any
more meetings. The students be-
came bewildered. Those who had
corresponded with friends in Chi-
na were also -located by the se-
cret agents of the Federal In-
vestigation Bureau who put un-
reasonable obstacles in their way
and asked them hundred and one

questions. Students have simply

been deprived of all their poli-
tical freedom.

3. They worship money and
are doped by religion. Money is
the thing most thought of by
American students because it is
the key to enjoyment. As a means
of making money, “knocking
other people down to step into
their shoes” has been fostered
since childhood as a kind of phil-
osophy of life. To seek personal
advancement, they may, with a
dagger, pierce the back of the
person who “obstructs” them, be
that person one of their best
friends! In Chicago there was the
conspiracy of two university stu-
dents to kill a baby. Their mo-
tive was very simple: to do a
shocking thing like that would

make them famous!

Another spiritual repository of
the students is religion. They be-
lieve in God. They believe that
God is “almighty.” They have
been told by the American gov-
ernment that they should pray
to God for world peace and pray
to God to “save” the youth of the

socialist countries. The aggression
of American troops abroad is
committed also to obey the will

of God! In the United States
“God” has become_ a tool of the
monopolist clique to ‘dope the
youth.
