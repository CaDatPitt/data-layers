More Breadth Given
In All Disciplines,

More Depth in Major

The Academic Assembly of
the University is presently
considering a broader curric-
ulum program for Liberal
Arts students in which great- A
er depth in the Natural Sci-
ences, Humanities, and Social
Sciences will be emphasized.

Last Thursday, upon recommen-
dation of the Executive Council
of the School of Liberal-Arts,
the Assembly approved a ‘state- 1
ment of general‘ principles design-
ed _to establish a ‘flexible policy
for achieving this objective.

Under this policy the Dean of
the School of Liberal Arts, the
departments, and the individual,
faculty members will work to-
wards developing a student skill-1»
ed in depth as well as bredth.

Studies Distributed

In order to accomplish such a
goal, studies will be distributed
across the three divisions of the
disciplines by work in courses /
speciﬁcally designed to awaken”
the student to the richness of his
intellectual heritage and to de-
velop in him aecritical judgment
in the arts and sciences.

The Arts student’s major pro- , ‘
gram will be constructed so that
he acquires knowledge of the
scope of the discipline, is com-
petent in its methods and funda-
mental‘ principles, and has an

(See election results,,pjage 2) ,

Elmer Merkovskyi won the Student Government elec-
tion but Dick Sobota will be the next SG president. Merkov—
sky, althoughthe received 57 more votes than Sobota, has
been disqualiﬁed because his QPA is lower than the mini-
mum which the SG constitution speciﬁes. A I

Commenting on this situation, Sobota, who polled 372
~9votes, said, “The election day
events, as surprising as they were,
proved one thing? that some stu-
dents are willing to put their ef-
fort into advancing what they be-
lieve.

“Most certainly this point was
proven, but I do not feel that the
answer, of SG problems would
have been reached by placing
l_\/Ierkovsky in office. V

Praises Enthusiasm

“Certainly, no one man can
run a student government which
will give students what they want
and presently" do not have.

“But I feel that if I, along
with the rest of my administra-
‘tion, can get Student,Govern—
ment back on the right track, it‘
will not be difficult for students
themselves to get SG rolling in
the right direction.” A

He observed that if more stu-
dents, either independently or as
part of organizations, displayed
the same enthusiasm for their
candidates in theifuture as they
didefor Elmer, student govern-
ment would realize increased
popularity in the public eye.

' Registration
To Begin For I
Spring Term  

l ,All students who want courses
in the spring term should make
appointments with their advisors

V immediately. March 31 is the last
day for spring registration.

Richard Hodges, director of stu-
dent records, said that courses are
being scheduled on a .“first come,
ﬁrst served basis” and if the pres-
ent trend continues, late comers
cannot expect to receive the
courses or the times that they de-
sire.

According to Hodges, more stu-
dents have registered for spring
courses than were expected.

At present, the total is 829.
~_,,« This includes: 205 in Liberal

Arts,, 64 in Business Adminis-

tration, 504 in Engineering and

Mines’, 5 in Nursing, 12 in grad-

uate work, and 39- non-degree

students. The average number

of credits per student is 9.15. ,

A Students in the School of ‘Lib- ,

eral Arts were given the chance to

make appointments in the begin-

ning of February. Those who did

not are now receiving post cards

for appointments.

By TOM BRYANT
_ Although the ‘Univ-ersity
has not officially announced
that it will force Saturday
classes upon students, a poll
taken by The Pitt News has
revealed generally, unfavora-

ble comments concerning an en-
forced program.

“There are a lot of disadvant-
ages to Saturday classes,” says
K83’ Pagonis, Arts jr. “Dorm stu-
dents won’t have a chance to go

process “too much.”

-Jay Furick, Eng. in, said “The
purpose of the trimester was to
decrease the timeneeded to grad-
uate. I feel that the Saturday
classes speed the educational pro-
cess again needlessly.

“Since we have the trimester,
why do we have to go to class on
Saturday too?”

At least two students felt that
religion would play a major role
in inﬂuencing student rejection of
the Saturday scheduling. ‘-

“Being a junior, the new sys-

blum, Arts fr. felt that the Satur-

day scheduling would discourage
future students from enrolling in
the University.

“Although Pitt has done a. lot
to interest out-of-towners into
applying for admission, going to
school six days—a—week will not
appeal to them.”

Students favoring the new plan
represented a minority in the
poll’s results.

Carol Edwards, Arts fr. said
that “Saturday classes are a good
thing. If a student can’t take a

Woineifs Housing p
Gets New Ruling

A new

regulation has been
made concerning housing for wo-
men attending the Spring trimes-

Reed Whittemore, modern poet
and Associate Professor of English
at Carleton College.

The poet will read his own
poetry at noon, and at the coffee
hour he will discuss “little maga-
zines.” A

Whittemore is replacing Alastair‘

Reid, another poet, who was ori-
ginally scheduled for this Midday
talk.

Reed Whittemore is a graduate
of Yale and the editor of a new
literary quarterly published by
Carleton College, “Theﬁcarléton

Miscellany.”
Three books of Whittemore’s
poems have been published /
“Heroes and Heroines” (1947),-T"
“An American Takes A Walk’
(1956), and “The Self-Made Man”
(1959). He once published a small
quarterly called “Furioso.” 4
Reed Whittemore’s poetry has
been published in many maga-
zines, including, Poet-ry, Esquire,
New Republic, Nation, Saturday
Review, New Yorker and Ne

ter. In a letter which was sent to
all resident women, it was stated
that: “Any undergraduate woman
student, regardless of the num-
ber of credits carried during the
Spring trimester, must live on
campus or in housing approved
by the Dean of Women’s Office.”

It was also announced that Mc-
Cormick Hall will be the only
dormitory open for women stu-
dents this spring. Undergraduates
will be housed on floors two
through eight. « A

course on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, then the new system
provides additional sections.”
Al Rosen,‘ Arts fr. said that
“students who really want an
education won’t mind the incon-
venience of Saturday classes.”
Finally, Mike Cusick, Eng. Soph,
summed up the overall student
opinion. “Saturday classes are no
good. I wouldn’t take them if they
paid me, and I’m certainly paying
them enough for what I’m taking
now.” ~ I

tem won’t effect me too much,
said Itzhak Epstein, Arts, an
exchange student from Israel.
“However,'I deﬁnitely would not
attend Saturday classes because
they are an infringement upon
the religious beliefs of certain
students of the Jewish faith.”
“The University wouldn’t ask
Christian students to attend classes
on Sunday; therefore Jewish stu-
dents shouldn’t have to attend on
their Sabbath.”
‘Another student, Phil Rosen-

» ome on week-ends and part-time
jobs will be impossible.”
Commuting students ﬁnd most
fault with the new plan. , “Satur-
day clases don’t appeal to me,”
commented Ray Jiannino, Arts ]'I‘.,
“because I communte 20 miles
every day from McDonald.”
“Impractical for commuters
because of the added expense”
was the comment voiced by Jim
Broff, Arts fr. »

Know Representatives
The ' ﬁrst item on
agenda is to present to the stu-
dent body a proposed amendment
to the constitution to increase the
number of senators and distribute
them more evenly among the stu-
-dents. ,

“If students want to be heard,
they must speak out; but, in the
past, there have not been
enough interested people to lis-
ten to them. I want every stu-
dent to know just who his rep-
resentative really is —— this is
something unknown to our stu-
dents today,” Sobota -explained.

“Wednesday’s events were the

lﬁrst signs that we do have some,

students in this school who are
not as apathetic a.s they are made
out to be. I hope that thisenthu-
siasm will continue, and that it

{will continue in the right direc-
’ tion.
Can Help or Hurt

“Finally, I do not feel that the
demonstration will have a detri-
mental effect on SG, because I do
not interpret the happenings as
mere mischief or ridicule.

“Although many of those vot-
ing for Merkovsky did not un-
derstand fully “why” they were
doing so, I feelthat those he-
hind -the movement were seri-
ous-minded, and had a ‘worth-
while objective in sight—arous-
ing the interest in our SG.”

When. Ronald Pease, assistant
Dean of Men, was asked what
effect the voting would hav_e upon
SG, he replied, “A lot depends on
what direction Elmer and his fol-
lowers are headed. .

“If they lose interest because
of his ineligibility, it will hurt
Student Government, but if they
continue their interest and are
‘sincere in their attempt to con-
tribute, they can be a constructive
element in the present SG even
though they are not in ofﬁce.”

It is further believed that the

most casual dress acceptablein the

private areas of the residence
hall, for example, is not appro-
priate elsewhere on campus.

2. School clothes should be worn
in the classrooms at all times.
‘jSchool clothes” are defined as
collared shirts tucked i'n dress or

khaki pants for men; sweaters,
blouses, skirts, or dresses for
women.

I 3. School clothes should beworn
in the dining areas, libraries, and
Student Union from 7 a.m. to 7
p.m. except on Saturday at which
time sports clothes will bevaccept-
able. A

-4. School clothes should be con-
sidered the minimum standard of
dress at all University affairs un-
less otherwise speciﬁed.

'5. Students should check their
coats before entering the cafeteria
atall times in order to allow max-
imum seating space for all.

6. Inasmuch as any such reg-
ulation should remain reason-
able and inasmuch as the intent
of this regulation is simply that
the standard of dress be re-
spectfully appropriate, it is sub-
ject to review for the Spring
term or as the need arises.

Commenting’ on the code, Dr.
William L. Swartzbaugh, dean oi
students, said, “The Olﬁce of the
Dean of Students fully supports

49

' the work which this student com-

mittees has done on this matter,
and their recognition that sensible
and appropriate dress, far beyond
merely giving an impression to
others of our University, is often
related to our conduct and our
concern for others. .The code is
certainly a reasonable one and one
which any University, student
should be willing to uphold,”

experience of depth in one or
more of its ﬁelds. . -

The new program will also at-
tempt t-o give the student an un-
derstanding of the relationship of
his major discipline to related
fields of knowledge and the ability
to integrate and exercise his dis-
ciplinary skills in such ﬁelds.

Approval Withheld

The Assembly withheld approv-
al of the second recommendation
‘regarding the execution of this
policy until a definition of basic
academic skills could be deter-
mined. They will vote again this
Thursday.

The proposed policy stated
that no Arts student could ap-
I ply more than_l5 credits of work
in the elementary courses to his
degree requirement of 124 cred-
its. These courses include com-
position, foreign language and
mathematics or logic.

Other changes passed, uncon-
tested. One such change expected
to go into effect is the distribu-
tion of a student’s studies over
the three main divisions of the
disciplines, the Humanities, the
Social Sciences, and the Natural
Sciences, whereby he takes 15
credits instead of the regular 18
credits of work in courses specifi-
cally designated for , distribution
purposes in each division.

In addition, a miniumm/of 24
credits of course work must be
completed in the major ﬁeld and
at least 12 credits in the courses
of the related discipline. If .a stu-
dent elects to do 12 credits of
work in’ each of two related «dis-
ciplines, the distribution require-
ments of 15 credits in the division
of his major may be waived. V

But the Arts student must still
satisfactorily complete two terms
of physical education or the basic

program th either Military or Air
Science. ‘ .

“M'e, too, hey,” she cried.

“Tell me,” he cried, “are you a girl of expensive t.a.st-es?’,”‘

“N0, hey,” she cried, “I am a girl of simple tastes.”

“Good,” he cried, “formy cruel father sends me an allowance
barely large enough to support life.”

' “l\'Ioney does not matter to me,” she cried.“‘l\Iy tastes are
simple, my wants are few. Just take me riding in a long, new,
yellow convertible and I am content.”

“Goodbye,” he cried, and ran awayas fast as his chubby little
legs could carry him, for he had no convertible, nor the money to
buy one, nor the means to get the money, short of picking up his
stingy father by the ankles and shaking him till his wallet

fell out.

He knew he must forget this girl but, lying on his pallet at the
dormitory, whimpering andmoaning, he knewlhe could not.
At last an idea came to him: though he did not have the money
to buy a convertible, perhaps he had enough to rent one!

“Oh, goody,” she said Whenwshe sawthe car. “This suits my

andthrough bosky dolls.”

And away they drove. All that day and night they drove and
ﬁnally, tired but happy, they parked high on a windswept hill.

“Marlboro?” he said.
“Yum yum,” she said.

They lit up. They puffed with deep contentment.

“You

know,” he said, “you are like a .Marlboro~—mild and fresh

and relaxing.”

“But there is a big difference between Marlboro and me,” she
said, “because I do not havea Selectrate ﬁlter nor do I come

in soft pack or ﬂip-top box."

They laughed. They kissed. He screamed.

“What is it, my dear,’ 3 she cried, alarmed.

“Look at the speedometer,” he said. “We have driven 200
miles and this car costs 10¢ a. mile and I have only $20 left.’5

“But that’s exactly enough,” she said.

“Yes,” he said, “but we still have to drive home.”

They fell into a profound gloom. He started the motor a.nd

backed out of the parking place.

“Hey, look!” she said. “The speedometer doesn’t move when

you’re backing up.”

He looked- It was true. “Eureka. l” he cried. “That solves my
problem. I will drive home in reverse. Then no more miles will
register on the speedometer and I will have enough money

topay

“I think that’s a marvelous idea,” she said, and she was right.
Because today our hero is in the county jail where food, clothes

Irv Richman
 W1'ites Song

» For Rock&Roll

~./

By PAT CHERKIN

Irv Richman, Ed. sr., is one
person who hopes that “Rock
and Roll is here to stay.” He
has recently made a demon-
stration record, “Lois” which
he hopes to record. The
Southern Record Company in New
York is interested in his record.

Irv writes the words and music
himself, and sings and plays piano

for his song. “However,” he said,

“there is a possibility that Paul
Anka will record my song.”

Paul Anka is a young vocalist
who has made popular, “Diana,”
gm-1 “Put Your Head On My
Shoulder.”

“Lois” is a jitterbug tune with
a catchy beat.

Irv has written two other songs
from which he will choose the
‘flip side’ if he does the re-
cording himself. They are “Come
To Me,” a cha cha; and a ballad,
“The Girl That I Love.”

This musician has been singing
professionally since he was eight
years old, and has studied piano
for several years. In addition to
making his own record, Irv sings
with “The Uniques,” a Pittsburgh
vocal group. .

“I've been interested in Rock
and Roll since I was about
fifteen,” Richman says. He’s been
composing songs since then.

Irv will graduate in April and
then teach elementary school. He
plans to continue song-writing as
a side-line. He is a member of
Kappa Nu social fraternity.

Is your future up insthe air?

As the conununic-.1tions needs of our nation
become steadily greater and more complex,
the Bell Telephone System is continuing its
pioneer work in microwave by “taking to the
air” more and more to get the word across.

‘To this end, VVestern Electric—the manu-
facturing arm of the Bell System~.lms the
monumental task of producing -.1 large part of
the microwave transmission equipment that
knits our country together by shrinking thou-
sands of miles into more seconds.

In spite of its great technological strides.
the science of radio relay is a rapidly-changing
one. And new break—throughs and advances
are common occurrences. A case in point: our
Bell System “TH” Microw-.1\'e Radio Relay.
This newest development in long-distance
telephone transmission will eventually triple
the present message-carrying capacity of exist-
ing long-haul radio relay installations. A full-
scale system of 6 working and 2 protection
channels can handle 11,000 telephone mes-
sages at the same time.

‘ To make microwave work takes a host of
special equipment and components: relay
towers, antennae, waveguides, traveling wave-
tubes, transistors, etc. But just as important,

a

it takes top—c-aliber people to help us broaden
our horizons into such exciting new areas as
communication by satellites!

And microwave is only ‘part of Western
Elec'tric’s opportunity story. VVe have—rigl1t
now-hundreds of challenging and rewarding
positions in virtually all areas of telephony,
as well as in development and building of
defense communications and missile guidance
systems for the Government.

So,’ if your future is “up in the air," you owe
it to your career to see “wh-.1t’s up” for you at
\Vestern Electric. {

Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus-
trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. For more
information, get your copy of "Western Electric and
Your Career" from your Placement Officer. Or write

pany, I95 Broadway, New York 7, N. Y. And be sure

to arrange for a Western Electric interview when tho

. Peace Corps

Although students may obtain applications for mem-
bership ingthe Peace Corps from the Office of Cultural and
Educational Exchange, this doesn’t constitute enlistment.
It merely insures’ the student that the information regard-
ing their availability will be transmitted to the proper au-
thorities. . » -

The rigidity of tests taken and requirements ‘needed

to establish membership» will be determined by 7 Congress,

it is hoped, in the near future- -

Whatis the role of members inthe Peace Corps, should
be answered by every student before applying for admis-
sion to that group. That the Peace Corps‘ is not an exile for

draft dodging or a glamorous‘ foreign legion, students al- .

ready know. ,

Possibly President Kennedy’s statement in his State
of the Union address——ask not what your country can do
for you but what you can do for your country-provides
the clue to why such an organization is being established.

, ‘We want to ‘gain respect from other nations, to rid
foreign countries of indifferent American representatives,

whose past actions have brought only scorn to the United-

States. Most likely lessfortunate nations will never like
Americans, in general,_ but perhaps they will be able to

respect its image. a _ _ »
Students, undergraduate or graduate, who are plan-

ning to enlist in the Peace Corps, should give "serious con-

sideration to what this ‘-group. will demand -of'=them~:b.efoi*e 

applying for admission.

Curriculum Cliunge  

‘The new curriculum proposed for the School of ‘Lib’-.  -

._eral Arts is a positive move in the direction -of establish.-g
mg. higher academic standards at the University.

Each Liberal Arts graduate will possess the necessary
basic skills, a more extensive background in all three divi-
,siBns, and a greater depth in his own major ﬁeld. _

' Although the requirements for each division would be

— reduced from 18 credits to 15 credits, the entering fresh-

man unless well-prepared in the basic academic skills of
composition, foreign language and mathematics, would
need more than 124 credits to graduate since only 15 credits

‘of courses taken in these ﬁelds are applicable to the 124

needed for graduation. . .

The elementary courses would most likely include
English 1 and 2, Math 19, 20 and 21, Philosophy 3 and 4 and
elementary and intermediate language courses.

For example, a science major can now ﬁllthe Human-
ities requirement by elementary and intermediate German
and one year of literature. If this new curriculum is adopt-
«ed the language course could not be applied. ’ —

The adoption of this curriculum would be advantage-
ous to the student because he would be meeting the re-

_quirements of each division with courses that were not
mere surveys--courses that would help 1 him to acquire,
Wknowledge ofsthescope of each discipline. ..

Kirk Discusses De-emphasis

Of Norms in American Society

By JULES ZACHER
“The de—emphasis ofnormsin America has had calam-
~ itous results,” was a key phrase in the lecture, “The Recov-

ery of Norms,” presented by Dr. Russel Kirk before the So-
ciety for Conservative Studies last Wednesday.

Dr. Kirk defined a norm as a standard‘ or a measure of

what man does or ought to do.

can also be an ideal or a goal ofo

proper behavior which man pur-
sues.

«T The -eminent
continued his iecture by warning
the audience to beware of new

, idealogies that have disregarded
norms. Dr. Kirk extended the
warning by showing danger sig-
nals of total collapse in the con-
temporary American scene, which
are due to the American peoples’
disregard for norms. ,

“Gross and material pleasures
are the sole concern of many
Americans today,” was the ﬁrst
fault of our society stated by Dr.
Kirk. He felt that materialism and
the desire to be sociable has dis-
placed religion inmany American

.,,~homes. » R
Dr. Kirk said that another so-

.cial ill brought on by the aban-
doning of our norms occurs in
education. Dr. John Dewey» in-
stilled in our educational system
the theory that we must teach
our .s_tudents* to adjust to the
modern world if they _are to be
happy. _

Dr. Kirk criticized this theory
by stating that we should not
teach our students to adopt to the
world if the modern world is un-
just and evil. , _

Dr. Kirk then turned his critical
eye to politics. ‘He believed that
. some liberals have the opinion
that government should be handed
over to highly specialized men
‘ who have absolute authority. But

Dr. Kirk feels that this is nothing
but Facism. '

Ending his speech’ on a dour
viewpoint, he told the audience
that the Russians can see our
weaknesses resulting from our
abandoning of our norms, and
will be quick to take advantage
of this situation.

According to Dr. Kirk, a norm

Review of Shirer’s

 Novel on Germany

Mrs. Davitt S. Bell, active in
educational and civic organiza-
tions, will review, “The Rise and
Fall of the Third Reich” by Wil-
liam L. Shirer, Wednesday, in the
Fine Books Room of the Book
Center at 4:15 p.m.

“The Rise and Fall of the Third
Reich,” was the November, 1960
selection of the Book-of-the-
Month-Club. It is the complete
story of,Hitler’s empire.

Shirer wrote this book from in-
formation which he gathered after
watching and reporting on the
Nazis since 1925. He was also an
on-thc—spot reporter in Germany
and Europe for forty years.

This book is the complete
story of Hitler’s loves, .his~im—
prisonment, and his suicide. It
also contains hundreds of inside

stories about the war which
were found in the Nazi ﬁles
after the unconditional sur-

render of Germany.

“The Rise and Fall of the Third
Reich” offers a chance, to those
who are curious, to learn more

about the background of t h e
world’s tensions. '

Cats End Season With 57-53 "Wins

   Maloney, Fridley Sink

. V 0 o
Fouls to Gain Victory
' By JIM O'BRIEN ’
Nervous prostration and ulcers were on the menu at the

Memorial Field House on Sa

turday night as the Panthers

eked out a nerve-whacking 57-53 win over arch-rival Penn.
State in the ﬁnal moment of hectic action.

The F-Boys, John Fridley

and Dick Falenski were grad-

uating after starring for Coach Bob Timmons for three years,

and they added to their laurelsb

a winning season -— their ﬁrst in
varsity play. The two co—captains
received new basketballs as a
token of a respectable 12-11 sea-
son.

Fridley led the Cats scoring
with 20 points and Falenski was
right behind with 13 -points. Frid-
ley intercepted a pass with 42
seconds to go, when State was
maneuvering for a ﬁnal shot
which proved the turning point of
the game.

i Maloney Drives

The winners took time
When the ball was brought
play, Tom Maloney drove toward
the hoop and curled a layup goal-
ward. It fell off the rim, but he
was fouled in the act. Maloney
converted two free throws to
break a 53-53 tie.

In the final seconds Fridley
was fouled and he added two
more charity tosses to put the
icing on the cake. Bob Timmons
remarked, “It got to the point
where one mistake wbuld be the
difference. They made the mis-
take—Fridley’s interception was
the turning point.”

In the first half it didn’t look
too good for the eventual victors.
They were down 7 points, 34-27,
at, the intermission, after the
Lion’s 5’-10" Mark Dumars hit 5
of 6 shots from the floor and 5
of 5 free throws, plus an assort-
ment of magical assists.

Defensive Changes

But Coach Timmons made some
defensive changes. He assigned
Falenski to DuMars and put Ben
Jinks on Gene Harris. A weary
Dumars was limited to one free
throw, and booted the ball out of
bounds in the ﬁnal seconds when
State was working for the tying
score. Jinks was superb in nulli-
fying Harris’ attempts.

“I don’t believe that Falenski
did a better defensive job,” Penn
State’s coach John Egli com-
mented, “Mark’s had a had an-
kle and the flu lately, and this
is the longest he’s played for a
long time. He» got tired, that's
all. You can’t defense that kid.”

When the score was tied, Ma-
loney was dribbling the ball and
fell to the floor, sprawling over
the foot of Dumars. A jump ball
was called following a scramble
with Harris, and State gained con-
trol. “That could have been fatal,”
Timmons remarked. “He was trip-
ped and the refs missed it.”

“The officiating was extremely
good," Egli retorted. “It was sen-

out.

sational." So a vote of ‘well done’.

Duquesne’s freshmen repeated
an earlier performance last Wed-

Panther cubs, 67-51. Willie Somer-
set had 25 points and John Cegalis
had 14 for the Dukes. Paul Krieg-

er led the yearlings with 13
points.

Coach Carl Peterson opened
with a man for man defense

against the Dukes. Dave Sauer
guarded Paul Kudelko and Cal
Sheffield watched Somerset as the

Duke‘s scoring punch.
\Vith eight minutes remaining
in the half, both Sheffield, who

had drawn his 3rd personal, and
a tiring Sauer who was still weak
from a recent virus sickness
were taken out of‘ the game. At_
this point the score was 16-13,
favor of the Blufﬁtes and they
went on to increase their lead
to a 29-15 half time margin.

Gymnasts Face
Mountaineers
Tomorrow

By LARRY HAGGERTY

A tired, travel-weary Pan-
ther gymnastics team con-
cludes its_ most disappointing
season in five years when
they travel to Morgantown
to encounter West Virginia

tomorrow evening. The gym clash
1.-, ,1 way at 7:30.
Originally the meet was sched-

uled for Feb. 8, in Morgantown,’

but poor weather and bad driving
conditions forced a postponement
of the contest. The Mountaineers,
coached by Bill Bonsall, have

never beaten the Panthers gym-~

nasts.

The Jungle Cats had little diffi-
culty in handling the Georgia
Tech gymnasts on Thursday, 86-
41, for their ﬁrst win of the sea-
son. The meet was highlighted by
Ron Daugherty’s 3.9 seconds time
on the rope which tied the Pan-
their record formerly held by John
Cacolice.

After leaving Atlanta on
Thursday evening the Blue and
Gold departed for Temple, but
fog delayed the arrival, via a
two hour layover in Washing-
ton, D.C., and the Panthers’
plane did not land in Philadel-
phia until 8‘ o’clock Friday
morning.

It was evident that the Panthers
were tired on Satuday when they
were downed by
Temple’s margin of victory came
on Panther Earl McConnell’s ﬁrst
loss of the season in tumbling and
a sweep of the parallel bars.

McConnell ﬁnished third in
tumbling behind the Owls’ Lou
Datilio and Dave Perilstein. The
only Panther victory was re-
corded on the rope when Daugh-
erty and Joe Battaglia tied for
ﬁrst.

As the result of losing to Tem- *

ple, the Panthers ended up in last
place in the six-team EIGL. Navy

Track Standout
Leaves College
To Join Army,

By JACK SBIITH

uni‘:|||||llIllllllllllllllllll

The University will lose one of its most promising track-

5men this Week when sophomore Harry Stokes withdraws
from school to join the Army.

’ No reasons were given for Stoke’s withdrawal. He did

say, however, that he would return after his two-year mil-

itary stint. “I expect to run while in

a better runner when I return to
Pitt.” .

His returning to Pitt in the fu-
ture will not help the track team this
year. His absence will be felt, for
Stokes is the best middle-distance
runner the Panthers’ have had since
Johnny Woodruff and Arnie Sowell,
1937 and 1956 respectively.

Stokes runs the 440-yard
dash in 47.2 seconds and the half
mile in 1:513, According to

track coach Carl Rees, “Stokes was a sure bet to break
"{ the University’s 440-yard dash record of 47 seconds set
by Woodruff in 1937.”

The Panthers had a chance to place one of their relay
teams in the IC4A Indoor Championships held March 11 in
New York City. "But without Stokes, neither relay team ap-

' pears to be a contender.
' * * * * *

 

On the brighter side of the ledger is a freshman foot-

ball player for next year. ,
Pant-her football coaches are seeking the services of a
negro halfback named Hawthorne Duckett. Duckett is prob-
ably one of the hottest college prospects the Panthers have
“had a chance to get since Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi pounded the
gridiron inthe late forties.

. Duckett hails from the eastern part of the State,
Doylestown, and attended Central Bucks High School ,
where he led his team to a league championship. He also
led the league in yards gained, 1,1.92 for a 9.5 yards per‘
carry, and points scored, 125.

=.% 21¢ =|= #5 =l=
Bob Timmons, basketball and football coach, recently
announced that he is relinquishing his gridiron responsibili-
ties. .
“I’m becoming too old to do both jobs,” said the 48-year-
old oach. The two jobs keep me busy from September to
‘March. That’s too much of a grind.”
Contrary to what many sports fans believe, Timmons is
‘ not quitting football in order to devote greater’ eﬁorts to
basketball. “I never took part in football spring practice,”
Timmons said, “and that is the time for basketball recruit-
ing; therefore, the two sports didn’t clash.”

VVhen Pitt and Notre Dame
have met on the gridiron, the
Fighting Irish came out on
top 3/5 of the time.

But few people know that
the Blue & Gold hold a 13-10

regular season all—time advantage
over the Irish in basketball.
Before the 1951-52 season, the
series stood 11-10 in favor of
Skyscraper U. Notre Dame had a
hoop powerhouse that year. They
had scheduled two games with
the Panthers, hoping to win both
of them, grab the lead in the all-

time series, and then d1‘0p the-

whole thing.

In Jan. 1952 the first half of the
home—and-home pair was sched-
uled for the new Memorial Field
House. Notre Dame built up a 15-
point halftime advantage, but
blew it in the third quarter and
ﬁnally lost, 62-55.

So when the Panthers visited
South Bend three weeks later,
they found themselves playing a

‘team with a chip on its shoulder.
Again the hosts outplayed the
Jungle Cats. Cat captain John
Kendrick, a clever and depend-
able backcourt man, called time
out with only ﬁve seconds re-
maining in the half, wasting a
time out. _
“Nothing went right during that
ﬁrst half,” says Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, cage mentor in 1952 who has
since been named to basketba11’s
Hall of Fame. “Kendrick’s lapse
was only one of several costly
ones we made.”

Carlson _Spurs Team

‘Whatever Carlson told his
charges at intermission soon had
its ‘effect. Playing steadily, re-
bounding well and setting up
their shots, the Panthers began to
move. With Dick Deitrick, Don
Virostek, and Mickey Zernich
leading the way, they battled into
the lead with the fourth quarter
about half gone..

The Cats’ margin ran as high
as seven points at one stage, but

The Panthers had no time outs

left because of the mistake at the-

end of the

half, but Carlson

-managed to tell his boys to freeze

the ball for that last shot. With
about twenty seconds left, Ken-
drick got the ball. Carlson ex-
plains it this way:

“Everyone in the field house
knew the score but John (Ken-
drick). The stalling must have
changed his pattern of thought,
because he was planning tc let
the clock run out, thinking we
were ahead. As he dribbled into
the far left corner, someone ﬁnal-
ly got through to him. He let fly
an “Ozarklke” type shot that
swished the nets just as the gun
sounded.” Final score Pitt 62-

By JIM HUFNAGEL
A pleasant but slightly weary “May I help you?” greets
everyone of the 100 persons who pass through the door of

405 SU everyday.

Because ofthe speedy solution of their problems, how-
ever, most of those who have business. in the office of the
director of Student Publication never realize that they are

only one of many.

A large number of visitors is
only one of Marian Nehus’ head-
aches. Marian, who is secretary to
the director of student publica-
tions, has also answered more
than 52,000 phone calls (about 50
a day) during the four years that
she has been working for the Uni-
versity.

When not answering the tele-
phone or dispensing information,
Mrs. Nehus handles all the cor-
respondence for the director of
student publications, the Owl, the
Skyscraper Engineer, Ideas and
Fig-uires, Polaris the Pitt Capsule,
Phi Eta Sigma, Pi Delta Epsilon,
and The Pitt News.

At the top of her list of pet,
annoyances, she puts the fact
that people calling the Univer-
sity seem to think that her of-
fice is an information center.

In spite or her many problems,
Marian says of her job, “I love it;
I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
The work is hard but I have a
great boss and meet a lot of won-
derful people."

“It is a pleasure to be- able to
be over at the University for
several hours and .know that
Mrs. Nehus will iron out any
problems which may arise while
I am away,” Irving Rothman,
