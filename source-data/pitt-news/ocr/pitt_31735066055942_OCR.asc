Pitt has revoked the charter
of the Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI)
fraternity for an alleged hazing
incident last fall that sent- one
pledging member to the hospi-
tal for alcohol poisoning.

On Dec. 4, Thomas
Hammond was taken to Presby
Hospital around 11:30 p.m.
after becoming:sick and von1it- —

 it ing blood at the FIJI house on
' Wallingford Street. Hammond

said he and others were forced

Pitt’s freshman engineering program has
recently been selected as one of five 1996
Outstanding Institutional Advising Program
Award winners by the National Academic
Advising Association (NACADA).

The award recognizes innovative practices
that have improved advising services for
freshmen and is given annually in a variety
of categories. Pitt’s award category includes
programs serving a specific population of
students, such as freshmen engineers.

The program is responsible for recruiting
new freshman and transfer students, as well
as guidingthese students through advising,

nar, all 300 or

career counseling. The pro-

gram was redesigned in order to improve stu-
dent adjustment and to reduce stress and ten-
sion in students’ lives. V

Before the freshman engineering program
was created, all freshman engineering stu-
dents were required to take a non—credit
freshman engineering seminar. In the semi-

so freshmen met for 50 min-

utes in the auditorium, a practice that faculty
and students alike felt was not working.
“Students were frustrated, bored, non-
attentive — basically fulfilling a require-
ment, but I’m not sure they were getting any-
thing out of it,

Pitt prof wins 2 awards for life's work

Anne Estonilo
For The Pitt News

A Pitt professor of political rhetoric recent-
ly received two career awards for teaching
and research at the Eastern Communication
Association (ECA) meeting in New York.

Theodore O. Windt, department chair of
communication and a member of the
Association for 25 years, is only one of two
individuals who received both the
Distinguished Teaching Fellow Award and
the Distinguished Research Fellow Award.
The Awards were offered for the first time by
the ECA this year.

Deborah Borisoff, president of the ECA,
credits Windt as one of the forefathers of
presidential rhetoric.

“Ted Windt’s work in the way of presiden-
tial rhetoric is legendary,” Borisoff said.

According to Borisoff, the extensive
research and work by Windt colleague Dan
Hahn created the discipline of presidential
rhetoric. She said that programs all over the
nation today rely on Windt’s research.

Windt created the first presidential rhetoric
course in the country, a course that began as. a
seminar 25 years ago. When asked to teach
the seminar as a course, Windt felt he did not
have enough material to make it a full semes-
ter course. As his work in the area grew,
however, so did the class, at one time reach-
ing 500 to 600 students per class.

Today, Windt’s Presidential Rhetoric class
remains just as popular and is known for
being ﬁlled during the first days of registra-
tion, though he has now limited it to about
100 students.

Windt was not originally interested in polit- _

ical rhetoric. He did his undergraduate work
in English at Texas Lutheran College and
went on to a graduate program in theater arts
at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
His academic orientation changed when a
professor introduced him to the works of
Khruschev, the premier of the USSR from
1958 to 1964. Pursuing this new interest,
Windt completed his rhetoric and philosophy
degrees at Ohio State University.

Author and editor of a number of scholarly
articles and five books, three of which won
the Everett Lee Hunt Scholarship award,
Windt has already collected many honors. He
is a past recipient of the Chancellor’s
Distinguished Teachers Award at Pitt and has
served as the chair of the communication
committee of the Institute of Politics at the
University. In 1987-1988, he served on the
Harvard commission on presidential press
conferences. He was KDKA-TV’s political
commentator on “Weekend Magazine” for 10
years and presently does political analysis for
KQV radio.

Windt is also a professional campaign con-
sultant and has worked on gubernatorial and
senatorial campaigns from Alabama to
Michigan. He is currently working on two
new books: “Conformity, Coexistence, and
Change: Rhetoric in the l950s” and ‘p‘In
Search of Consensus: Political Rhetoric in the
1970s.”

When asked if he ever tired of studying
political speeches and figures like JFK or
Nixon, Windt replied, “The information is
constantly being revised. Information that
was once classified is now available.”

Student selected for
prestigious in tern
position with ACT

 

Laura Jacobson
For The Pitt News

Every student, regardless of
her career choice, has heard
how important internships are

in obtaining any career goal.

The problem comes in ﬁnding
one and getting through rigor-
ous screening for competitive
programs.

For Brenda Siok Hoon Lim,
a Pitt student worldng toward
her Ph.D. in the research
methodology program in the
school of education, the hard
work has had a huge payoff.
The recipient of her dedication
is ACT, a nonproﬁt organiza-
tion focused on research in
measurement and statistics in
education.

The highly competitive
ACT program chose only
eight students from hundreds
of applicants. Lim was among
those chosen to intern for
eight weeks this summer at the
company’s Iowa City head-
quarters.

“I feel very lucky about
receiving this intemship,” Lim
said. Lim hopes the internship
will open up job opportunities
and provide an outlet for

at 624-5984.

he Center for Overcoming Problem Eating (COPE) at the

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is seeking women
ages 18 to 35 to participate in a research study. If you are suf-
fering from anorexia or bulimia nervosa, or have recovered,
you maybe-eligible to participate in this study. Participants
must be medication-free (birth control pills are acceptable).
Participants will be paid up to_$400 upon completion of the
study. For more information or to see if you qualify for the
study, please call the Center for Overcoming Problem Eating

expressing her own ideas
about research in educational
testing.

As a child, Lim, who is orig-
inally from Singapore, was
always interested in quantita-
tive reasoning and mathemat-
ics. After receiving her bache-
lor’s of commerce in Canada,
she returned to Singapore. It
was her four-year stay in
Singapore that sparked her
love for statistics. Lim headed
for Pittsburgh because Pitt had
what she wanted, a master’s

V program in applied statistics.

However, it was not Lim’s
academic achievements alone
which landed her the intem-
ship. She is an active member
of the American Statistical
Association, the American
Education Research
Association and the National
Council of Measurement in
Education.

‘ Equally impressive to ACT
members was Lim’s heart. In
Singapore, Lim took part in a
youth fellowship in which she
helped troubled teens and
taught Sunday school.

In her free time, Lim enjoys
shopping and swimming at
Trees Hall.

Laura Narducci, from Sen. Rick Santorum’s ofﬁce, said that
the appropriations measures will probably be passed, and that
the actual appropriations do not have a long way to go.

according to McClintock. Pell Grants, State Student Incentive
grants, and Federal Student Loans are all federally—funded.

Money for education has also been threatened with cuts at the
state level. As Pitt faces a reduction of its state grant, it is con-
sidering measures to maintain its revenue levels, among them a
larger tuition increase than its originally plarmed increase of 3.5
percent.

“We wantpeople who are going to be in it for the long haul,”
Campbell said of the student efforts to lobby the government,
adding that it will last longer than anyone’s term in Student
Government or even longer than some people will be in school.

oversees education appropriations. Pennsylvania’s other Senator,
Rick Santorum, also supported the Specter-Harkin amendment.

The PAT shuttles’ expanding services
and student discounts will not raise the
student transportation fee — for now.

“Fees will not go up this year,” said
Bob Harkins, director for parking and
transportation. But if the service expands
even more in the next few years, Harkins

— said Pitt will have to consider raising the

fee.

This is one of the issues raised by Pitt’s
new contract with PAT that Harkins will
take up with the student transportation
committee this September.

Pitt recently signed a four-year
contract with PAT extending the
PAT shuttle service for students,
faculty and staff. Under the new
contract, the Pitt zone will stretch
into Oakland down to Craft
Avenue and Fifth, which is a few
blocks further than before.
Students will also get discounts
for bus rides. in .zone one in the
evenings and on weekends, and
possibly discounts on monthly
bus passes.

The Pitt zone is the area in which rid-
ers can board for free with a Pitt I.D. It
includes parts-of Squirrel Hill and
Shadyside. Harkins said he had hoped the
zones would expand in Squirrel Hill and
Shadyside due to student complaints
about the locations of the bus line, but

. the deal that Pitt could get wasglimited by

its cost.

“The only thing I can tell students is
that we’ve tried to work the best deal we
can for them,” Harkins said. “Without

. doubling the fee, you can’t go to all of _

zone one.”

But during the evenings and weekends,
students will be able to go anywhere in
zone one, which includes downtown and
the South Side, for $.50 instead of the

regular fare of $1.25.

Students may also get a discount on
monthly bus passes, which will help
those who live outside of the Pitt zone
and can’t ride free with a Pitt I.D. But the
discount depends on how many people
take advantage of the program, Harkins
said.

“It’s very important number-wise for
students to get bus passes through us,” he
said. “The more I sell, the bigger dis-
count I get.”

Harkins said the discount could equal
as much as $12 per month deducted from

the normal cost of $40 per month.

your transportation fee, I’ll get you back
$12 per month off your bus pass. So in
five months, you’ve got back the money
you paid for the transportation fee.”

The new agreement will cost Pitt
$396,000. next year, almost double the
$208,000 the University paid last year.
Last year, which was considered an
experimental period, Pitt agreed to pay
PAT only the amount that the former
shuttle service had cost.

This year’s cost was based on the unan-
ticipated high ridership numbers that PAT
buses have collected from the Pitt zone
since the summer of 1995 — over 1 mil-
lion. Pitt will reimburse PAT about $.33
per rider. _

The cost will probably grow during the
next few years.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, May'29, 1996

Pitt zone expands under PAT contract

Harkins said Pitt will try to control
costs by monitoring numbers more close-
ly of people who use old I.D.’s or I.D.’s
that aren’t validated.‘ Currently, the only
way a bus driver can check this is by
looking for a current sticker on the back
of an I.D. .

“It’s awful hard for a driver on the bus
to look at the picture, ﬂip it over to see
the sticker when 20 people are trying to
board the bus,” Harkins said.

Pitt and PAT may consider developing
a portable machine on the buses that peo-
ple would swipe their cards through as
they board. The system would alert the
driver when someone doesn’t have a vali-
dated I_.D., which may mean that
the student hasn’t paid the trans-
portation fee yet or is using the
I.D. of someone who has gradu-
ated. '

Other problems that
arose during the experimental
period included miscommunica-
tion between PAT and its drivers
and students. When the Pitt zone
in Oakland was expanded down
to Children’s Hospital, some
PAT drivers didn’t know about the

change, which caused problems for.stu- ,

dentsutrying to get off at the hospital.

Also, many students weren’t using the

U-zone buses early in the year. The U-
zone bus lines roughly match the lines of

regular PAT routes, such as the 61C and '

71C. -
When parking and transportation
administrators'noticed that 61C buses

were coming in crowded and 64U buses

almost empty, they considered ending the
U-zone bus lines. But over the last year,

ridership has picked up on the bus line.

“I was very concerned all year long
that the students weren’t going to be
happy riding the PAT system,” Harkins
said. “What I found is that people got
comfortable relatively easy.”

Volunteer group names day
to get involved, help kids

Charisse E. Merchant
For The- Pitt News

Pitt students and other community members
have a chance to spend Saturday helping area
children by volunteering their time and energy.

Pittsburgh Cares For Kids Day and the first
annual Servathon will take place June 1 at the
DiCesare Engler I. C. Light Amphitheatre in
Station Square.

The Servathon is a fundraising function ‘pri-
marily for the benefit of Pittsburgh’s children.
Volunteers are asked to help raise pledges and
donate their time to help partake in communi-
ty projects of two main varieties: those
improving grounds where children work and
play and those dealing directly with the chil-
dren.

Some improvement projects involve build-
ing outdoor classrooms at local elementary
schools or building playgrounds. Local com-
panies like State Farm and Anderson
Consulting help with these projects on a year-
round basis. However, other businesses like
Blue Cross and PNC Bank will donate their
time for the day of the Servathon.

Volunteers are also asked to contribute by
dealing directly with the children. Volunteers
do this by taking children to museums and

other educational sites. Some of Miller
Elementary School’s children will have a field

trip to the Pittsburgh Zoo. The Zoo con- '

tributed by donating free tickets.

There will be a celebration party for volun-
teers from 3-5 p.m. at the Sand Bar in Sand
Castle. Pirate tickets, restaurants gift certifi-
cates, round-trip tickets on USAir, an evening
at the Westin William Penn and other prizes
will be awarded to the greatest donators.
Anyone raising over $25 will be awarded a
Pittsburgh Cares For Kids Day t-shirt.

All proceeds will beneﬁt‘ Pittsburgh Cares, a
nonprofit organization. Pittsburgh Cares hopes
to gross over $30,000 from pledges, according
to Carolyn Falk of Pittsburgh Cares.

The Servathon is part of a nationwide net-
work which has been successful in other cities.
According to Falk, Chicago, Miami,
Baltimore, Atlanta, New York City and other
U.S cities have grossed pledges ranging from
$20,000 to over $100,000. Pittsburgh Cares
hopes to further the success of the network.

Registration begins at 8:30 a.m. at the I.C.
Light Amphitheatre, where volunteers will be
greeted by Mayor Tom Murphy, radio station
B-94’s Shelly Duffy and Pirates owner Kevin
McC1atchy. For more information, call
Pittsburgh Cares at 471-2114. '

in smaller numbers, so that

we could have one-on—one
dialogue,” Bishop said.

The upper—class engineering
students were able to give,the
freshmen what they had been

 

missing in the earlier system,
a link to the real world. The
upper—class students were
able to share their experi-

“We thought if we gave

Freshmen have to chose
their department at the end of
the term, so one of the pur-
poses of the program is to
give them information about

teach the importanceof time

sophomore engineering
physics major and mentor for
the freshman engineering pro-
gram. ‘ ‘
Another goal of the pro-

-gram was to raise the School

by holding office hours and

tours when families came to

visit. In the 1995 school year,
253 students enrolled; by
1996, after the changes were
instituted, that number rose to

“We think that maybe that’s
one of the reasons the num-

Call gov’ t to account

Federal funding for various educational grants have

come under attack in recent months by legislators, send-
ing the message that education is not the top priority for
the government.

These funds provide money for such programs as feder-
ally Subsidized Student Loans, Pell Grant, State Student
Incentive Grants, and Stafford Loans. Many students
depend on these loans just to keep themselves in school.

At the same time that the federal funding is just barely
keeping up with the costs that it has to cover, at the state
level, Pennsylvania is also letting its funding for educa-
tion slide. Just holding the funding for Pitt at last year’s
levels maylead to an even greater increase in tuition than
3.5 percent.

Instead, it seems this country wants to return to the phi-
losophy of the Cold War garrison state. Instead of educat-
ing the next generation of America’s leaders, we seem
more interesting in building prisons to hold them while
they sit under the defensive umbrella of an anti-ballistic-
missile defense system. Arguments still rage over
whether or not to go ahead with the Star Wars programs
of satellite based defense systems.

Yet, as the Oklahoma City bombing and the attacks on
the New York subways and World Trade Center show, the
real threats are not going to come raining out of the sky
on multiple warhead missiles, but from terrorists, includ-
ing those from within the country itself.

The United States faces more subtle threats than these,
however, in the form of environmental damage, health
care concerns, and infrastructure decay. These are not
problems that can be solved with larger guns and bigger
prisons. These are problems that must be solved by
trained leaders and thinkers who can approach these con-
cerns with the knowledge and ability to see the underly-
ing causes. I

As we approach the end of this century, the world is
changing much faster than ever before. The time that we
are given in college can give us a handle on these
changes by providing a theoretical framework in which to
deal with them.

The students who are at Pitt now, and those of you who ’

are incoming freshmen, must begin to call the govern-
ment on the carpet about these sorts of issues. If they are
going to leave you with their messes to clean up, then at
least make them give you some kind of skills to begin
dealing with the mess.

Contact your elected representatives at both the state
and local level and tell them that it is education that will
determine the success of this country in the years to
come. -

You know, being poor
really sucks. I realize this is
not a particularly eloquent
way of describing my cur-
rent financial situation, but
I feel that my current finan-
cial situation does not lend
itself well to eloquence,
what with how badly it
sucks and all.

-Before I become the
recipient of excessive ‘pity,
let me reassure you that my
poverty is basically superfi-
cial. My parents are both
relatively secure middle-
class types, which frequent-
ly earns me the scorn of my
roommate, the product of a
somewhat more blue—collar
environment, who only puts
up with me because he fig-
ures that somewhere
beneath my suburban sur-
face flows the blood that
proves me a true son of
Poland, or at least a true
great—great-grandson of
Polish/Russian immigrants
who had already filled out
the naturalization papers
before they realized they
were in Baltimore Harbor,
not on Ellis Island, and
wasn’t Cousin Kostak going
to be confused when they
didn’t show up.

But — if I may be permit-
ted one massive understate-
ment — I digress. The point
is that although my parents

ARE»there as a sort of safe-
ty net, they’re a net I prefer
not to fall into, primarily
because I feel that if you’re
always confident in a safety
net’s ability to catch you
when you fall, you never
take the ti-me to learn to
keep your own balance. And
considering the sheer vol-
ume of junk underfoot on
the highwire that is life
(shoulda been a poet, shoul-
da been a poet), balancing
is a real handy skill to have
on tap.

So here I am in'Pittsburgh
for the summer with two
significant occupations: a

part-time job that brings in

just enough money to pay
the rent and utility bills
(subtle parenthetical: BUT
NOT FOOD), and a
research position which is
supposed to provide enough
money to live on while I do
scholarly things. Only prob-
lem is, Our Alma Mater
Which Loves Us And Cares
For Us So Much has a real-
ly cool payroll system
which says that I won’t get
that research grant until

halfway through the sum—,

mer. '

(Monday night: noodles
and a glass of ice water.
Tuesday night: noodles and
a glass of ice water.
Wednesday night: a glass of
ice water. Thursday night: .a
-glass of ice. Friday night: a
glass.)

To make a long story
short, I now present without
further ado Steve’s Tips For
Making It Financially
Through The Summer:

1. Sell your bed. A bed is
a luxury. I don’t mean the
frame, I mean the mattress
andlbox spring too. When
the landlord just will not
wait for your first paycheck
to arrive before‘ demanding

the rent in full, you need to
very quickly remind your-
self ‘that even a blanket on
the floor of your apartment
is more than a homeless
person would have, and you
should be thankful for it.

2. Carbohydrates are your
friend. Spaghetti is 79 cents
a box, which is about four
servings. A loaf of white
bread at Giant Eagle some-
times goes on sale for. 50
cents. A large carton of
plain oatmeal is $1.29. You
can exist on these three
things, plus water, for quite
a while as long as you have
a source of heat and a good
imagination.

3. Have a girlfriend. I ‘

recommend this no matter
what gender you are,
because women are just
plain more thoughtful. They
understand that you need
their love and support. They
understand that you need

one decent meal a week. '

(They frequently don’t,
however, understand why
you had to sell your bed.)

4. Entertain yourself. You
don’t need to waste money
on the movies or theater
when you can simply walk
around Oakland looking at
all the strange people. You

.don’t need to buy new

books when you can write
your own. (But you can’t
afford to buy paper, so write
on your hands.)

5. Some things can't be
compromised. Don’t trade
your beat-up tape deck for a
meal; music will keep you
sane when the food has
gone. I personally recom-
mend that great Philly band,
The Hooters, because it’s
nearly impossible to listen
to their music without expe-
riencing an increase in

Anti-abortion doesn’t
mean that you're pro-life

Rick
N owlin

 

I’ve been known to get into hot
discussions on political issues with
some of my evangelical friends,
especially since I disagree with
them most of the time. One hap-
pened a couple of weeks ago, when

' one of my fellow church members

who is more conservative than I
started raving about the “liberal
media” — and she used the exam-
ple of their general use of the term
“anti-abortion” rather than “pro—
life.” I told her, to her astonish-
ment, I agreed with that distinction
and use it myself.

Because there’s a whole lot more
to being “pro-life” than just being
opposed to abortion, euthanasia and
infanticide.

It’s not that I don’t believe in the
sanctity of human life as anti-abor-
tionists see it-- I just happen to
believe that such an attitude should
be extended to all of life, not just
the unborn. I readily admit that my
stance is unusual for an abortion

opponent, but I find it the only way

to be consistent. In fact, I have
come to oppose abortion for the
same reason I oppose such things as
war, racism, and pollution — as each,
in its own way, cheapens human
life for various political reasons.

On the other hand, for that reason
I find a certain irony about the issue
of abortion being the linchpin of the
conservative movement since the
mid-1970s. The American right
certainly believes in legislation out-
lawing it — but it seems to me that
other issues equally deserving of
“sanctity of life” status conserva-
tives either ignore or consider pro-
motion of such “govemment med-
dling.” There was a saying years
ago that Republicans (most anti-
abortionists support the GOP)
believed that life began at concep-
tion and ended at birth.

And I think there’s a good reason
for that. You see, being truly “pro-
life” could be politically and finan-
cially inconvenient, for many rea-
sons.

For example, while anti-abortion-
ists rightly denounce abortion-pro-
moting policies around the world
(such as the “one-child” policy in
mainland China), they‘ often say
nothing when it comes to such
things as malnutrition, disease and
warfare in some of those same
places. They were practically silent
when it came to apartheid in South
Africa — some nitwits even sug-
gested that black suffrage, because
of an exaggerated fear of commu-
nism, threatened American security.

The conservative solution to gang

warfare? Lock ‘em up and throw
away thekey, and if they act up
enough, let’s just give ‘em a dose of
potassium nitrate and be done with
them. Trouble is, we’re now incar-
cerating gang members in record
numbers‘, and youth crime is still on
the increase. And that doesn’t count
the kids who never made it to
prison because they were shot to
death on the street. This is being
“pro-life?” I

It seems to me that promotingithe
sanctity of human‘ life also means

maintaining clean air and water, yet .

conservatives have long tried‘ to
weaken laws which actually pro-
mote protection of the environment.
“It costs too much in ‘money and
jobs,” they complain. Sorry, but I
don’t buy that. Actually, consider-
ing the escalating cost of health
care, not to mention possible law-
suits against corporations due to
environmental negligence, it just
might be cheaper to do the right
thing.

What about the concentration of
more and more wealth into fewer
and fewer hands, evidenced by
record gains on Wall Street while
people lose their jobs? You general-
ly don’t hear about those issues
from people who like to call them-
selves “pro-life.” And welfare pro-
grams have long been under attack
(and having been on welfare
myself, I’m no fan of the system
anyway), but most people who
complain about it offer no reason-
able alternatives — so people starve
or freeze to death. Sounds to me
that the “sanctity of human life” is
being abridged.

I also have to ask: Would people
vote for, say, a Josef Stalin or a
Nicolae Ceausescu today? Both

were power-hungry Marxist dicta-

tors who ruled without regard for
the lives of their citizenry. And
both had abortion.banned in their
respective countries.

And although I didn’t set out to
say this, I have to look at the ways
anti—abortion forces, in their pas-
sion, have mistreated their critics
and enemies - and end up doing

more damage to their movement ,

than they realize. When I attended
Pitt in the early 1980s, members of
the previous incarnation of Students
for Life, which dominated the
Christian fellowship I attended at
the time, regularly browbeat people
like myself who agreed with their
position but not their militancy.
One time, a girl simply screamed a
verse from Psalms at me about
“being fearfully and wonderfully
made.” It didn’t take a genius to see
that, if Roe v. Wade weren’t over-
turned soon, .“pro-lifers” would
soon take to the streets — and other
lives, “fearfully and wonderfully
made,” would be in danger.

And you see the results — in
Wichita and Boston .' ’

That’s why I generally don’t call
abortion opponentslby their pre-
ferred designation. For me, there’s
more to being “pro-life” than just
being anti-abortion. -

doesn’t make you smile, their silly

really isn’t, will.)

These quick and easy tips can help
keep you aﬂoat in the turbulent sea
that is life (shoulda been a poet!) for
a while until your ship comes in. Of
course, if you ARE working a typical
Pitt summer job, your ship will proba-
bly be nothing more extravagant than
an abandoned raft which, upon closer
examination, isn’t actually a raft at all
but just an old door that someone
threw into the ocean while laughing
and saying, “Hey, I just threw my

door into the ocean, mostly because I -

can afford to buy a new one!”
Arrrgggh! Ijust HAD to go and
start talking about the ocean, which
reminds me that I could have gone
home to the South Jersey coast and
spent the summer lounging on the
beach for free instead of staying in

Pittsburgh, being poor, and trying to‘

be, like, ambitious and academic and
stuff, which I kinda thought was the
point of college but now I’m recon-
sidering. Anyone with a car want to
take a road trip to the-beach?

Um  I can pay you back for the

Columnist
Matt
Grove

s Shaquille O’Neal
walked solemnly off
the court Sunday after

the Chicago Bulls completed

a four-game sweep of his

Orlando Magic, even more

speculation stirred about the

possibility that O’Neal had
just played his last game at
the O-Rena.

Reports out of Orlando and
Los Angeles recently said
that O’Neal, a free agent
come July 1, would leave
Orlando in favor of the bright
lights - big city atmosphere
of Los Angeles and the
Lakers. Although O’Neal has
decided to wait until after the
NBA Finals to make his deci-
sion, we may have seen the
7—foot-l, 310 pound commer-
cial guru play his final game
in a Magic uniform.

Only 24 years old, Shaq
has already made enough
money to be comfortable for
the rest of his natural life, as
well as the natural lives of
countless others. What might
keep O’Neal in Orlando?

Men's hoops hires Christian as assistant

Mike Kovak
Sports Editor

Once again, men’s basketball head coach Ralph Willard
dipped his hands into the assistant coaching waters at the
University of Miami, Ohio. Jim Christian, an assistant
coach for the last year at Miami, Ohio, was named as the
replacement for Sean Miller, Pitt’s all-time leading foul
shooter and assist man.

Miller left Pitt after being offered a similar position at
North Carolina State, under new head coach Herb Sendek,
whom Miller previously worked for at Miami, Ohio.

Christian, a former player for Willard at St. Dominic
High School, also served as his assistant during Willard’s
formative years at Western Kentucky University from
1990-92. Prior to Pitt, Christian worked the 1994-95 sea-
son under new Western Kentucky head coach Matt
Kilcullen on a team that went 27-4.

Between his two stints at Western Kentucky, Christian
was an assistant coach at St. Francis (Pa).

“I am extremely happy that Jim Christian will be join-
ing our staff,” Willard said. “He has had experience with
our style of play at Western Kentucky, and he has done an
outstanding job at both St. Francis and Miami.”

Christian can’t contain his joy after receiving a chance
to coach in the Big East Conference, after five years as an
assistant coach in smaller conferences.

“I am truly excited to be a part of the University of
Pittsburgh and the men’s‘ basketball program,” Christian
said. “I am equally excited about being reunited with
coach Willard. In my life, coach Willard has been a major
inﬂuence and my experiences with him as a player trig-
gered me into pursuing coaching as a profession. I have
also known Bobby Jones (assistant coach) for many years
and have a great deal .of respect for him. I am looking for-
ward to working with him and the rest of the staff and
becoming a part of Pitt’s basketball success.”

With that bit of public relations aside, the 31-year-old
Christian was an All-State guard at St. Dominic’s, located
in Bethpage,“ New York. Following high school,
Christian’s hoops career continued at Boston University,
where he played for two seasons before transferring to

‘Rhode Island University.

At Rhode Island, Christian was a key part of a Rams

team that shocked the college basketball world by reach-
ing the Sweet 16 in 1988. The team was featured in
Readers Digest. He also played one season professionally
for the Sydney City Comets in Australia. 9

Christian joins a Panther basketball team that struggled
to a 10-17 record last season and is reeling from a sum-

Gill, Miller and potential recruit Jamaal Magliore.

Pittgraduate student Marisa Pedulla hopes to become the ﬁrst
American gold medalist in the judo competition._|n addition to
training and classes, she appeared on American Gladiators.

Benjamin Jackson ‘
Editor-in-Chief

_ The competition will be ﬁerce
and violent, and at the end of the
day, only one person will be left
standing, literally. The sport is
Olympic Judo, and the best in
the world will come to compete
in Atlanta this summer.

One of the University of
Pittsburgh’s own will be in
Atlanta trying to be the first
American to capture a gold
medal in this sport. Marisa
Pedulla, a graduate student in the
department of Biological sci-
ences, won a place on the U.S.
Olympic Judo team. On Jan 12
of this year, Pedulla beat all
competitors _in the 52 kilogram
(114.4 pounds) weight class at
the Olympic Judo Trials in
Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Pedulla began studying judo
in the fall of 1981. The ﬁrst time
she stepped onto the mat, her
brother threw her and knocked
the wind out of her.

“I wondered if this was really
for me,” she said. But she has
stuck with it, and now she is liv-
ing a lifelong dream to be in the
Olympics.

When asked to describe judo,
Pedulla said, “It’s a form of
Japanese wresﬂing in which you

for Olympic juclo

can throw your opponent to the
ground viciously, choke him into
unconsciousness or until he sub-
mits, or bend his elbow until you
break his arm or he submits. It
using the opponent’s movement
and force to defeat them.”

So what is the appeal of this
rough and tumble sport?

“When you step out onto the
mat, it’s just you out there, rely-
ing on yourself. It’s is the ampli-
ﬁcation of every emotion you’ve
had in your life a hundredfold,”
Pedulla said. “Throwing your
opponent and scoring an ippon
(a perfect throw, which wins the
match) is aesthetically beautiful
— your timing is right and it is
so automatic, you sometimes
aren’t even sure what throw you
just used.” ‘

Judo translated literally into
English means “gentle way” and
many practitioners say that it is a
way of life. Pedulla agrees, say-
ing that the lessons learned
through judo competition and
training carry over into all
aspects of life.

“[Judo] is a sport in that you
have physical conditioning and
competition, and it’s a way of
life in that you put your effort
strongly into things you try and
do,” Pedulla said. “You focus on

Names for a Few of
those Freshman Faces
playing at Pitt nex’r year

While most students and faculty are relaxing at cushy
nine-to-five jobs over the summer months, the work
does not stop for coaches and players on Pitt’s many
athletic teams. ‘

For several sports, with the exception of football and
basketball whose recruiting deadlines have already
passed, the summer provides coaches with the perfect
opportunity to recruit prospective collegiate athletes.

Now provides the opportunity to let the readers know
what athletes will be attending Pitt next season to com-
pete in various sports.

Wrestling:

1. Rob Loper (125 pounds, Erie, PA/Erie Prep
Academy)

Loper won the PIAA AAA State Championship at 125
pounds during his senior year. He defeated All-
American Todd Beckerman (5-4) at this year’s Dapper

attainment, setting a goal and
achieving it by dedication. It is
the same in academics, different
means, but the same en _.”

As part of her training regi-
men, Pedulla spends time teach-
ing judo to children and other
adults.

“It’s a great sport for kids
because it increases coordination
and self—conﬁdence. It is a sport
you can do throughout your life.
Through judo training, the idea
of the founder [Jigoro Kano]
was to make better people, as
you improve, your training part-
ners improve. You learn grace in
defeat and victory,” she said.

For other judoka [judo play-
ers] seeking hints for success,
Pedulla offers the following
advice: “Compete as much as
you can and try to get diﬁerent
inputs on your judo. Get as
much experience and variety in
judo to learn different techniques
that work for you. No one per-
son can guide you all the way
through.”

Pedulla came to Pitt in 1986 as
a Chancellor’s Scholar through
the University Honors College.
A Chancellor’s Scholarship is a
four-year scholarship which
pays for full tuition plus room
and board. As an undergraduate,
she majored in chemistry with a
bioscience option. She currently
is working towards her Ph.D.
studying myco-bacteria, which
is the family of bacteria respon-
sible for diseases such as leprosy
and tuberculosis. Her Ph.D.
advisor is Dr. Graham Hatfull, in
the biological sciences depart-
ment. Throughout her time at
Pitt, she says that she has
received a lot of support from
the Honors College, her advi-
sors, and her family.

“My advisor and my husband
[Dean J. Markovics], whenever

I’ve had to go off for a compet:i- . -

tion, have always just said
‘Good luck’ and never com-
plained about how much I have
been gone,” Pedulla said.

In a list of quotes entitled
‘Words to Live By’ Pedulla
quotes the Roman poet Horace’s
line “Seize the day, put no trust
in the morrow.”

On July 25, Marisa Pedulla
will seize her day, and her oppo-
nent, in her quest to be the ﬁrst
American to win an Olympic
gold medal in judo.

have come up with a better
plan that would give O’Neal
almost everything he’s been
looking for. A championship,
playing with Michael Jordan,
more time on the silver screen

Dikembe Mutombo

and ﬁnancial stability for his
family.

At the end of the current
NBA season, there is a long list
of players that will become free
agents that resembles an All-
Star roster. These players
include Michael Jordan,
Dikembe Mutombo, Kenny

    

*3.-.-JI/‘-w.

(left) and Alonzo Mourning (right) are two

high-profiled NBA free agents asking for $10 million per year.

Anderson, Alonzo Mourning,
Charles Barkley, Reggie
Miller, Juwan Howard, and
Horace Grant, Shaq’s team-
mate in Orlando.

Jordan recently asked for $18
million per year from the Bulls
(for two more seasons), but has
since given Jerry Krause a little
slack and is willing to negoti-
ate.

Mutombo is pushing for $10
million a year from the Denver
Nuggets. The Charlotte
Hornets’ Anderson is just
happy because he’s out of New
Jersey and married to Tami
from MTV’s “The Real
World.” ‘Barkley also wants the
opportunity to play on the same
team as Jordan, and Reggie
Miller just wants the chance to
shut up his sister Cheryl (an
analyst on TNT postgame
shows) and win a NBA title.
Mourning likes Miami and Pat
Riley, but is open to any rea-
sonable offers. Finally, Horace
Grant just wants some respect

from his peers for his hard
nosed style of play. Rah, rah.

Some of these players will
resign from their current teams
for some astronomical amount
that nobody but pro athletes
and divorced wives can imag-
ine asking for. Others will be
sporting some new duds come
October 1997. But, I thought as
I often do, what could be done
to make all of these players, as
well as the NBA, NBC, Bob
Costas and Disney CEO
Michael Eisner, happy?

Well, after countless minutes
of research and some tight
number crunching, here is what
I came up with.

These free agents will all
chip in and buy a new fran-
chise. Whatever they can’t
scrounge up, Disney will cover
and take full ownership of the
team because they own almost
everything anyway. The team
will not have a permanent resi-
dence; instead they will please
Shaq by having “home courts”

Michael Jordan, who said he
will not play for a team unless
Phil Jackson is the coach, will
be happy to hear that Jackson
will run the team with Pat
Riley (for you, Alonzo) and
Goofy by his side.

Mutombo, who speaks seven
languages, will be happy just to
get away from Mahmoud
Abdul-Rauf and subsequently
will be willing to play for less
than his ludicrous $10 million-
per—year request.

Barkley will be able to travel
around the world, playing golf
and punching cameramen, and
he won’t be in the same place
long enough to threaten the
safety of the residents by plan-
ning to run for office.

Anderson will still be excited -

about leaving Jersey — who

Reggie Miller can ﬁnally hop
a plane out of. Indiana for good,
never to return, because if he
bolted there isn’t anything left
there except Rik Smits and the

Horace Grant will be teamed
with Jordan again and will now
have three newspapers to com-
plain to about His Airness’
ego, all the while thinking
about how dumb he was to
have left Chicago in the first
place.

There were some problems
that I faced in working out the
glitches of this squad, and
some were unable to be solved
at print time but are being
worked on tirelessly.

What will the team be
called? The team carmot have a

Six Thousand reasons to go see Kelley Deal

After The Breeders were put
on hiatus a year and a half ago,
when guitarist Kelley Deal got
nailed for- a couple grams of
black tar heroin, all eyes were
on her sister Kim, who busied
herself recording with her new
project The Amps and produc-
ing the new Guided By Voices
album. Meanwhile, Kelley has
been more than busy herself,
supposedly kicking her habit,
forming a new band, recording
a record, and then starting up
her own label, to boot. .

When Kelley and her friend
Jesse Colin Roff recorded new
songs-for their project Solid
State last September, they were
offered record deals from a
slew of major and independent
labels. Deal, fresh out out of
the rehab hassle, decided it
wouldn’t be worth the extra
headache to sign another con-
tract, and opted to put the
record out herself, on her own
new Nice Records label. ‘

After she was contacted by a
New York band already using
the name Solid State, she
opted to change the band’s

name to The Kelley Deal

6000, a reference to one of the
15,000 “states of awareness”
described by'the hippie Arica
cult, which she is peripherally
interested in. Subsequent
recording in Minnesota (with
Dave Shouse of the Grifters,
among others) resulted in the
album go to the sugar altar,
which in my opinion is a much
better and more versatile
record than her sister’s new
album, Pacer. Don’t. get me
wrong, this is a pop album,
sometimes as sweet as the title
implies, but it’s full of
obscured bits of fuzzy sound
and lovely poetic vocals and
all the things you might expect
from one of the Deal twins.
Supposedly, Kim taught
Kelley how to play the guitar
right after she asked her to join

the Breeders a couple years
ago. It’s obvious by now that
Kelley has learned her lesson
well. When her band pulls into

rock movement is spawning stars. VV1th
the moniker “Indie Rock Champions” in
an NRM ad (when was the competition
held?), the Karl Hendricks Trio will
release their fourth album For A While It
Was Funny on Chapel Hill’s Merge
records.

In addition to the Trio’s cast of distor-
tion, power—packed enthusiasm, Hendricks

includes elegance in his lyrics as he con-
tinues to spew out frustrations. _

Like many Pittsburgh scenesters, I’ve
seen the Trio a million plus one times (but
not as many as Randy Costanza), and I’ll
continue to support them. Their live shows
are a kickfest. It warms the hearts of those
still suffering over the initial demise of
their hearts and it’s great to commiserate
in an environment where honesty hurts.

CMJ, the College Music Journal and the
staple of rock criticism described For A
While It Was Funny as the “build tension
up slowly and then stomp on the pedals to
send everything outward into a furious
hailstorm of pent-up aggression and fuzz
guitar” method I really don’t need to say
more, do I? .

Making a return to Pittsburgh are

recipe of slowness with tender vocals, The
Carnation play an atmospheric web of
sound. Opening the all-ages show at

The show starts at 10 p.m, Friday, May

La Haine (Hate)
Directed by
Kassovitz
(France, 1994)

Mathieu

“Do you know the story of
the guycwho jumps from a
building? As he falls down
the guy keeps telling himself
‘so far so good . . . so far so
good . . .’ But the fall is not
important, only the landing
matters.”

Finally an in-your-face
French film with social
dimensions. Finally a suc-
cessor to Cyril Collard and
his Savage Nights (Les Nuits
Fauves). Finally a French
film that doesn’t leave you
with tears in your eyes, but
with a bad taste in your
mouth.

Set in the suburbs outside
Paris, the film takes its audi-
ence for a 24 hour field-trip
into racism, exclusion,

revenge and hate. You will

 
   
 

 

c The Pitt News, Wednesday, May 29, 1996

be guided by three multicul-
tural youths angeredover
the brutalization of a friend
by the police during a stu-
dent riot the night before the
film begins. '

So far so good  But
when they find a loaded gun
you will experience what it’s
like to be young, excluded,
angry-and armed in a coun-
try where guns are as rare as
a good nightclub in
Pittsburgh.

Full of realism and a touch

of humor, La Haine is a
breathtaking look at the
growing social disorder of
contemporary France and a
wake-up call for the ‘so far
so good’ mentality of the
tranquil French’ middle-
class. .

The Cure
Wild Mood Swings
Elektra

. On Halloween, my senior year
in high school, I dressed up like
Robert Smith. Makeup, the bird’s
nest hair, black clothes, every-
thing. For my troubles, I got
called a fag by the school janitor
and the confused stares of all my
-peers. Anyway, it should come
as no surprise that I grabbed a
copy of The Cure’s new album,
Wild Mood Swings, the day it
was released and have been.lis-
tening to it non-stop since then.

The biggest and most welcome
change on this album is the addi-
tion. of a string quartet or horn
section on most of the songs,
replacing the synths of the past.
Alot of the songs are written
around acoustic guitar this time
around as .well. The presence of
the strings recalls Disintegration
more than any of their other past
work. However, Smith seems to
gradually be mellowing in his
old age, and these songs lack the
sense of hopelessness that much
of that album had. Replacing that
is a gentler sense of self-exami-
nation. 'Ihere’s a strong sense of
sweetness about this album. I
may be going out on a limb here,
but I think only someone
approaching middle age would
makean album like this, so
absent of the impulsive emotions
associated with youth.

The album opens with “Want,”
an electric guitar-heavy song
mixed by Alan Moulder of My
Bloody Valentine fame. The
murky guitar mix is reminiscent

. of MBV, but the strings and dis-
tinctive vocals of Smith make it '

stand out from any mere attempt
to copy. “The 13th “ sees the

band attempting a traditional-

Spanish-style song. Smith turns
in one of his stronger vocal per-
formances on this song, con-
sciously trying to sing in a diﬁ"er-
ent style than-he’s done in the

past. “Mint Car” stands out as ’

my favorite happy song the
band’s ever done. Every time I
hear it I want to run around my
room and eat sugary sweets.

“Jupiter Crash” has my
favorite lyrics on the album, link-
ing the narrator’s disappointment
with the unspectacular crash of a
comet into Jupiter with his disap-
pointment in a failed relation-
ship: “Was that it? Was that the
Jupiter show? It kinda wasn’t
quite what I’d hoped for you
know” sings the narrator in
bewilderment. The album ends
with the raw acoustic song
“Bare,” a song that Smith con-
siders the alburn’s central song.
In deeply personal terms, Smith
sings about growing old and
regretting the ways he’s changed.
Despite the sad nature of the
lyrics on paper, the music gives
the song a sense of hopefulness.
It’s one of the quietest and
strongest songs the band has ever
produced. Let’s hope they keep
producing music this good for
another twenty years.
