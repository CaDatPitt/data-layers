In a somewhat hectic meeting late

Friday afternoon, Druids, men’s lion-
orary sophomore society, voted to
clear the decks for action in answer
to the charges of inactivity hurled

toward it from various sources. Lack-

ing one of a sufficient number of mem-
bers to form a quorum, the group dis-
pensed with the Druid by-laws to per-
mit the transacting of old and new
business.

Reports from the temporary com-
mittees were read and discussed. The
social chairman, William Harvey, C,
submitted his statement regarding the
ﬁrst tea dance held in conjunction
with Cwens, women’s sophomore hon-
orary society, and intimated that a
similar proﬁt from future tea dances
will easily enable the founding of a
Druid scholarship in two years’ time,
\Vork on the index of the activities

Plans for the Druid room, a men’s
lounge for the sixth ﬂoor, have been
drawn by Russ Connolly, C, and sub-
mitted to the business manager of the
University, John Weber, for consider-
ation, it was announced by Edward
Durkin, C, president.

The committee of William Dornen-
burg, C; Theodore Biddle, faculty ad-
viser to Druids; and Durkin is still
engaged in the process of revising the
constitution and will present the new-
ly drawn document for a vote at an
early meeting,

Before adjourning Druids voted to
assist the sophomore women in pro-
moting their class dance, to take place
in Heinz House on February 14, and
to arrange a series of semi-weekly
luncheon meetings for the group. The
first of these meetings will be held
toniorrow at 12:30 o'clock.

Exactly 333 couples, 70 of whom
were guests, crowded the ballroom of
the VVilliam Penn hotel Friday night
for the annual Junior Prom, spon-
sored this year by the class of 1935.

Probable receip-ts of $923.30 against
expenditures of $901.60, give, to use
simple arithmetic, an estimated proﬁt
of $21.70. Though this total is far be-
low the ﬂat .$100 cleared by last year’s
Prom, it stands as next to the greatest
proﬁt made on any major University
affair this semester. The Freshman
Dance on November 17 netted $31.86,
However, the Soph Hop on November
3 broke even to the penny, and the
Yuletide Festival informal in Decem-
ber cleared slightly more than $8.
The expense account of the Prom was
the highest of the year.

Tal Henry and his North Caro-
linans, who played from 9:30 to 2
o’clock for the affair, depended
in the main on standard ar-
rangements with few original twists
to their offerings. The music, how-
ever, was smooth and well received.

The grand march at 10:30 o’clock
was led by Helen Bruun and Ellsworth
Miller. The programs and favors
were distributed during the march,
and the presence of these favors on
the wrists of so many women stu-
dents the last three days evidently
shows that they were quite accept-
able. The favors consisted of narrow
silver chain bracelets with miniature
padlocks for clasp-s. '

February 5-7 Set
For Registration

Cathedral Work Causesi Transfer
To Syria Mosque Basement

 

 

Preparations for handling students
who are planning to register during
the annual mid-semester registration
February 5, 6, and 7 at Syria Mosque
are rapidly being completed by the
staff of John G. Quick, registrar. The
registration committees in the various
schools have all received their in-
structions, and are preparing to facili-
tate the advising of registering stu-
dents as much as possible. It was de-
cided to change the place of registra-
tion_ from the Cathedral to Syria
i_Mosque,s.o that the construction work
‘on the Cathedral under the CWA will
not be restricted.

Registrar Quick released to the
News yesterday the various details
incident to the mid—semester registra-
tion. New freshmen will register
I from 9 to 10 o’clock Monday, February
5, From that time until 4 o’clock
February 6 all other students who
have not registered under the plan of
advance registration will be accom-
modated in Syria Mosque.

For the convenience of graduate,
special, and Saturday students the
time they will register has been moved
ahead to Saturday, February 3. This
will enable these students to enjoy a
short vacation before the beginning of
the second semester.

Glass Display

 

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head
of the department of chemistry
and an international authority on
glass, has acquired a new art
treasure for his already famous
glass collection. The panel has
been framed and is on display in
Room 305, Thaw hall, where Dr.
Silverman’s glass collection is
housed. The motif for the piece
‘was originated by Albert W. Va-
rasse, a Pittsburgh artist. Based
on a cut in “De Re Metallion,” by
Agricola, ‘published in Basle in
1556, it consists of an etching on
the-' under-side-i of a. sheet‘ of plate
glass. Mr. Varasse has applied a
Saracenic scroll above and below
the section depicting the furnace.
-A narrow Saracenic border also
outlines the panel.

The panel is an example of the
possibility of applying original art
to an everyday commodity. The
undertaking was the result of Dr.
Silverman’s efforts to encourage
the application of art in the
';American glass industry.

University Chess Team
Defeats Duquesne Group

The Pitt chess team defeated the
Duquesne night school team, ﬁve
boards to one, at the match which
took place Friday night at the Y hut.

The team from Pitt included:
Ilsley, Magram, Brandon, Phillips, Hed-
ner and Goretz, Members of the Du-
quesne team were: Z. Strothman,
Kunkel, S. Strothman, Riegner, Mc-
Gunness and Frank. S ‘

The same Pitt team will play the
team of the Pittsburgh Chess club at

Alumni  Booth To Provide
Text Exchange Facilities

 

The new ﬁling system instituted by
a sub-committee of the women’s room
committee will go into effect Feb-
ruary 7. The ﬁles, which are to be
at the disposal- of both men and
women, will do away, it is hoped,
with bulletin board congestion caused
by the sale of books between
semesters. V

Members of the committee will be
stationed at a booth on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
of Alumni hall for the ﬁrst two weeks
of the new-semester, ‘or as long after
as considered necessary, to receive ap-
plications of books wanted or for sale
to be listed in the ﬁles. There will
be two ﬁles: one, the “Books for
Sale” ﬁle and the other, the “Books
Wanted” ﬁle. An applicant must ﬁrst
look through the ﬁles to see whether
the book wanted or the book for sale
is not already listed by somebody
with whom he may do business. If
not, he ﬁlls out a card giving the
necessary information.

After this period of initiation of the
new system, the ﬁles will be moved
to Heinz House, where they will be
at the disposal of students from 10:30
to 2:30 o’clock daily,

It will be. theduty of every student
using the ﬁles to inform a member
of the committee when he has bought
or sold a book, so that his card may
be destroyed. This information will
be absolutely essential to the success
of the new system.

Women Debaters
Have Full Season

 

Since January 10, Members Have
Argued Before Five Groups

 

The women’s debating team partic-
ipated in the ﬁrst intercollegiate de-
bate of the season when they met Al-
I legheny college on January 17, before
}the Ben Avon League of Women Vot-
' ers at the Ben Avon Methodist church.

Marguerite Swank, C36, and Mar-
jorie Hanson, C34, representing Pitt,
defended the affirmative side of the
question, “Resolved: That the essen-
tial features of NRA be upheld,”
against a negative team from Alle-
gheny college, represented by Betty
Bright and Betty Zilhaver_

The sophomore debaters were
awarded the victory over the fresh-
men at their debate given at the din-
ner meeting of the VVomen’s Debat-
ing association on January 18. Betty
Glass and Ruth Tonkin were sopho-
more speakers, Agnes McClain and
Sarah Gluck gave the constructive
_speeches for the freshmen and the
‘refutation was given by Katherine
Hardy and Marcella Layton. Marjorie
Hanson acted as critic judge.

Since the opening debate on Jan-
uary 10, members of the association
have debated in succession before the
Thirty-second Ward League of Women
Voters, the Women’s Civic club of
Wilkinsburg, the Swissvale League of
Women Voters and Schenley high
school debating classes,

While they will cease activities dur-
ing. exam week, they will reopen the
season February 9 with two debates;

Tufts Will Speak
On Slum Sections

 

 

Will Analyze “Pagan Pittsburgh”
At Inquiry Forum Today

—j——

Sherwood Eddy‘s “Pagan Pitts-
burgh” will be analyzed by one of
Pittsburgh’s leading housing and slum
clearance authorities, Joseph P, Tufts,
executive director of the Pittsburgh
Housing association. at today's Inquiry
forum in Room 107, Alumni hall, at
12:30 o’clock,

Tuft’s talk will center about a
description of the actual conditions in
the poor or slum districts of Pitts-
burgh which, according to him, al-
though not “pagan,” are a serious
menace to the social welfare of Pitts-
burgh. He will also outline the
numerous methods of attack that will
be possible to use in the eradication
of slums.

“There is no short cut to slum
clearance,” said Tufts, “for it will
take careful planning by both local
and national experts to perfect a com-
prehensive plan that will be of real
value not only for the present but the
future.”

-9 Council will be asked to dissolve
itself as the student self ‘governing
body tonight. In the event of coun-
cil’s refusal, the petitions will be pre-
sented to the administration tomor-
row morning. The administration will
be asked to abolish Student council

, and set up a committee of seniors and

members of the administration as the
committee on student affairs, Such
a committee would havejurisdiction
over all student legislation and stu-
dent activity on the campus until the
spring elections, at which time another
form of student government would be
offered to the student body by the
committee on student affairs.

Members of the voluntary student
group which has drawn up and cir-
culated the petitions state that the
tendency toward centralization of all
student legislative activities will give
the central group more power and will
work with the administration for the
creation of a new type of student
government.

The choice of seniors as student
members of the committee on student
affairs is an indication that the com-
mittee composes a temporary legis-
lative body and because of their
status as seniors will not have any
personal interest in whatever form
of student government may be de-
vised.

of Student council; Scott Turner, E34,

The main objection which the com.
mlttee b1‘0Ught before council mem-
bers was Student council's slowness
in getting results on the trolley fare
question. Admitting that Student coun-
011 was doing everything it could,
otherwise, the group announced yes-
terday that it will co-operate with
council in bringing the matter before
state authorities,

Panhellenic Plans
Education Groups

 

Freshmen To Meet February 9
Under Muriel Dils

With rushing dates and regulations
drawn up for women’s fraternities’
Spring rushing, plans have been
formulated for the freshman educa-
tion program.

Due to the success of the informal
discussion assembly held in the fall
to acquaint second semester freshmen
with rushing rules and fraternity in-
formation, the same plan will be car-
ried out in the freshman education
program Friday, February 9, under
the leadership of Muriel Dils, Ed35.

In each of ten group discus-
sion groups, freshman girls
led by members of Panhellenic
council will discuss rushing rules
and the etiquette of frater-
nity life. During the course of the
meetings, the official women’s fra-
ternity handbook, O Philos, will be
distributed. Ruth Lazirovitz, C35,
,Panhellenic publicity chairman, an-
nounced this week that a fraternity
census has been taken, and the make-
up of the handbook, including a new
color scheme, is almost completed.
Alice O’Rourke, C35, Thelma. Ritter,
Ed 35, and Ruth Anderson, Ed36,
members of the publicity committee,
are assisting in the make-up of the
pamphlet.

Olson Prepares Strong

Pitt Team For Meet

Playing host to 18
traclnnen of this district, Pitt will
stage the annual indoor track and
field meet of the Allegheny Mountain
branch of the AAU at its track house
tomorrow and Friday nights. A full
program of eleven

list of entries will vie for the win-
ner’s honor in each event.
Every amateur athlete in this dis-

trict is eligible for the competition,;
It‘

including non-college performers.
is hoped that many high school track-
ers will appear to compete with the
collegiates and the unattached ath-
letes. '

Thursday night will see the running
off of the preliminaries in each
event with the exception of the hop,
step, and jump, The latter event has
but six entries, which will allow for
its completion on the opening night
of the meet. In all other events the
ﬁeld will be narrowed down to four
or eight contestants, depending upon
the number of entries reporting.
Activity will get under way at 7:30
o‘clock for the preliminaries.

Friday night, of course, will hold the
real ﬁreworks for track fans. The
semi-ﬁnals in the 50-yard dash and
the 50-yard high hurdles will open
the evening at 8 o’clock and the
ﬁnals in ten events will round out the
program. The order in which these
will be run is listed below.

The meet will abound with sports’
notables in the way of officials, W.
Don Harrison will preside as honor-
ary referee while the acting referee
will be William S. Haddock, secretary
of the AMA. James Hagan, Pitt
Graduate Manager of Athletics, is di-
rector. John Dambach, director of
Physical Education at Pitt, George
Kerr, L. VValsh, and Russell Fergu-
son, Pitt assistant instructor of his-
tory, are to be the judges.

Timers will include» Patrick Corr,
Pitt swimming coach, “Ziggy” Kahn,
of the Irene Kaufmann Settlement,
and John Christian. Field judges are
listed as Henry Blum, Bill Bode, ‘Wil-
liam Kern, newly-appointed ﬁrst as-
sistant football coach at Pitt, Markin-
felly, Russell, and Captain Palmer, of
Shadyside Academy. James Potts,
assistant Pitt track coach, will serve
as starter; Carl Olson, Pitt head track
coach, will act as clerk of the courts;
and J, J. Shannon will be custodian
of awards, Dr. H. M. Fink has been
named as the physician.

While every event is expected to
be hotly contested, there are several
especially brilliant bits of competi-
tion in store for the spectators if
past records are any indication of
what the trackmen will do tomorrow
and Friday nights. The pole vault
event is one which is attracting a
great deal of interest, due to the
recognized abilities of the men al-
ready entered. Salem, Ohio, will
send two star vaulters in Roessler
and Allen, both of whom cleared 13
feet consistently in high school com-
petition, along with a former Pitt
star, Roebusch. The local entries, Cy
Pelucha and Howdy O’Dell, varsity
Lalfbaclr, are being counted on give
the out-of-towners a stiff battle.

The high hurdles race will feature
two brilliant tirnber—t.oppers in VVork,
formerly of Purdue and now running
under the PAA colors, and Jimmy
(‘.uay, star Panther hurdler of last
year. Evans, 3. Geneva college lad,

Panther Freshmen Show
Class In Walla;-izing Kiski

Flashing the ﬁnest form they have
shown to date, the Pitt freshmen
completely outclassed the Kiski ﬁve
in a preliminary to the varsity game
Saturday. The little Panthers rode
roughshod over an unusually weak
team from the prep school and count-
ed a 51-26 victory.

Outstanding for the freshmen was
Ralph Ferguson, who contributed nine
ﬁeld goals from all angles to lead the
scorers. Ross Emerick played a
dandy game and accounted for nine
points, most of them coming from
pretty one-handed shots from close
in. Gaisford was best for the losers.

Cribbs again, the Notre Dame ﬂash can count himself as one of the luckiest
centers in basketball. For the past two years, Krause has been selected on
on the mythical “All-American” basketball team as the greatest center in
basketball. However, it seems that Cribbs cannot, or will not read the press
“rave” notices concerning this same Mr. Krause, and for the past two years,
the result of the center duels have been clearly in favor of the Jeannette lad.

ball handling characterized Cribbs’
great play in Saturday’s game that
snapped the Irish winning streak at
22 games. Little can be said against
Cribbs’ playing, and it was certainly
a sight for these sore eyes, bruised
nose, and sick stomach to see the
Track House Tarzan “come through.”

It was interesting to note the per-
sonal fouls called on both Cribbs and
Krause. Cribbs had the grand, and
perilous, total of three called against
him, while the halo-wearing Krause
