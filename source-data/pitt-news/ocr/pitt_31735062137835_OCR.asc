Of Schedule-Making

All Over Till Pebruary

By Charles B. Holstein

U. S. Grant, a direct descendant of
the famous president and great gen-
eral, and a distant relative of Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt, chewed
the blunt butt of a dead cigar, rubbed
the bristles of his one day's growth
of beard, Saturday night, and re-
fiected.

“Registration," mused Mr.
“must be over.”

Strewn over nearly every cubic foot
of ﬂoor space on the seventh and
eighth floors of the Cathedral was
a motley collection of preliminary
study lists, 1935 Owl blotters, torn
scratch paper,.cigarette stumps, school
catalogues, broken pencils, marked
up and partially destroyed pamphlets
of the time schedule of classes, not
to mention a few crumpled copies of
the Pitt News. But although a few
freshman registration cards were
seen where they had been lost, it
might be noted that there were no
athletic books nestling among the
trash.

It was one of the worst messes Mr.
Grant had seen. And Mr. Grant, in
his time, has seen some amazing
messes, for he, as one of the Ca-
thedral's night janitors, has often
cleaned up the News ofﬁce after dead-
line.

“The First Round-up” for 1934-35
had practically come to an end at 4

o’clock Saturday afternoon when the,

student assistants rose from the hard
chairs they'd been occupying for a
week and lighted cigarettes; Regis-
trar Quick and “Batch” stopped their
week-old marathon of runn.ing in and
out and up and down; the last fresh-
man boy had been refused his ap-
plication for admission to College
Orientation 1VV (the women’s course),
and the last freshman girl ﬁnally un-

derstood \that —she-~eou-ldn~’t-sclredule-

both physical education and ﬁne arts
for l\IVVF 3. Also, the section of
Room 717 reserved for the scholars
of the English department faculty no
longer resounded to a bedlam of puns;
the tough looking petty ofﬁcials in
checking capacities had wiped the
superior smirks from their faces and
become normal after the last regis-

‘tree had been chastised for neglecting

to signify whether it was '‘Miss’’ or
“Mr.” and the boys at the end of the
line who had been collecting the
names and telephone numbers of good
looking freshmain girls had taken
their material home
search,

It had been a hectic week beyond
doubt, but it had also been Mr.
Quick’s semi-annual big moment. For
six days distraught students and ot-
ﬁcials had been calling for him or
for his man Friday, Endicott Batch-
elder. “Batch” wa.s heard to admit
that should he make a mistake, “it
would hurt him to the Quick.” As
usual, the deferred payment booth
on the tenth floor had been extremely
popular.

It came out a.t the Freshman ban-
quet Thursday night that the new
dean of the College, Dr. Herbert Spen-
cer, had been stopped by “one of the
tall handsome chaps near the ele-
vator” and asked for his permit to
register. Tom Leachman, McClain,
Connoly and Weitershausen all do-
nied knowledge of the event, as did

"George Strong and a number of others

whose job was . . . and it may have
been just another one of those stories
to tell the freshmen.

‘ Among some of the cracks passed
in the English department, incidental-
ly, was this classic, alleged to have
been perpetrated by George Car-
ver: “Dodds in his heaven,all’s right
with the world.” Dr. Dodds, while try-
ing to place a junior in a helpful

literature course, denied emphatically.

that he was having much fun. Per-
cival Hunt, head of the English de-
partment, back from a stay at At-
lantic City, was heard to submit
this vignette: “Atlantic City, Amer-
ica’s comic strip.”

Appoint Mary Garber, ’33,
Aide To Dean Of Women

. Mary Garber, C33, former president
of Panhellenic and candidate for
senior queen, has received a scholar-
ship for personnel research in the
office of the dean of women. While
an undergraduate she was a member
of Mortar Board and Delta Zeta, social
fraternity.

During her research work, Miss
Garber will do part-time work as grad-
uate assistant to the dean of women.

New Course Offered

A special preparatory course in cer-
tiﬁed public accounting problems has
been added to the curriculum of the
accounting department. The course
will be taught by various staff mem-
bers and specialists in particular
ﬁelds,

Allan J. Fisher, instructor in ac-
counting, will offer a new evening
school course especially designed for
practicing attorneys.

number of artists invited, each one
has been limited to one canvas.

ternational were assembled by Homer

during his three-month visit in Eu-
rope this spring,

years, each national group of paint-
ings will be hung in a separate gal-
lery. In the event that an artist has
been invited to send more than one

painting, the works of that artist will
be grouped. _

Figures prepared by the ofﬁce of
John G. Quick, University registrar,
and released by the office of the dean
of men, show an all-fraternity quality
point average of 1.245, an improve-
ment over last year’s mark of 1.18.

Sigma Alpha Mu ranked ﬁrst in
quality point averages with a 1.61 rec-
ord, regaining the position which it
lost to Pi Lambda Phi last year.

At the end of the ﬁrst semester of
1933-34, the fraternities dropped to
their lowest average since 1927-28, 1.18
and one fraternity, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, hit an all-time low of _48.

Quality points are obtained as fol-
lows: each A grade credit is mul-
tiplied by three, B grade by two, C
grade by one and D grade by 0. The
fraternity average is obtained by add-

members of the fraternity and divid-
ing by the number of averages taken.

Research Bureau
Has Unique Class

 

Six Universities Represented In
Training Group Of Nine ’

Six colleges are represented in the
class of nine students who last week
began their training for executive
positions in department stores at the
Research Bureau for Retail Training.
These students were selected from a.
group of applicants representing uni-
versities and colleges throughout the
country.

This year’s class at the bureau is
unique in several respects. In the
group are three men, two of whom,
George E_ Mumma of Evanston, Illi-
nois, and John M. Wilson of Scotts-
burg Indiana, are graduates of the
Naval Academy at Annapolis. Wil-
liam B, Jackson, the other man in
the class, did his undergraduate work
in the College. L .!

The group differs from former bu-
reau classes, too, in that most of its
members are from Pittsburgh. Helen
K. Baerman, Westniinster college,
Hulda Brierly, Carnegie Institute of
Technology, Dorothy Kaufman, Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, Mrs. C. R.
Payne, Smith college, and Emma W.
Smith, University of Pittsburgh, all
Pittsburghers, and Nina Lambert,
Bucknell university, who comes from
Johnstown, complete the enrollment.

The bureau will continue its prac-
tice of giving its students a broad
backgroundof information about re-
tailing, speciﬁc information about the
methods which are common practice
in the business, and practical experi-
ence_. under supervision, in the busi-
ness itself. Three days of. the week
will be spent in classroom discussion
of current problems in retailing, and
the other three days will be devoted
to research work in the stores.

Players Announce First

There will be a general meeting of
all students interested in Pitt Players,
Thursday evening at 7:30 o’clock in
Room 315, Alumni hall. The meeting
is for old members and new hopefuls.
Anyone unable to attend should re-
port to Carl B. Cass, director, as soon
as possible.

During the meeting tryout sheets
will be distributed to the new men
and women, and time for tryouts will
be announced. The tryouts will be-
gin October 1 and will last for three
days, Contrary to former custom,
deﬁnite dates will be assigned and
must be adhered to. The Players’
bulletin board in the East entrance
of Alumni hall will carry further in-
formation.

Tyson Attends Meet

 

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics, attended the Silver Bay
Industrial Problems conference which
took place at Lake George, New York,
during July. The general type of dis-
cussion followed the theme of un-
solved problems of the NRA. Over
sixty industrialists and personnel
leaders were in attendance.

planning division of the State Emer-
gency Relief board at‘ Harrisburg.

The Carnegie Report

IS THERE ANY USE of a young

man’s' spending four years of
his life and 4,000 dollars of his
parents’ money by going to col-
lege?

This is the provocative question
raised by the Carnegie Founda-
tion in its survey of forty—nine
colleges and sixteen public school
systems of Pennsylvania which

concerns the actual intellectual

achievements of the college grad-
uate. What the Foundation did
was to give skillfully-prepared in-
telligence and general knowledge
tests to 2,800 high school and col-

lege students.

The results were surprising and
edifying. As a result of four years
of instruction, it was found, the
college men improved their score
on the intelligence test from ﬁfty-
six to ﬁfty—eight, but lost ground
in spelling, grammar, vocabulary,
English literature, history and
social studies. The average senior
in six colleges recognized only
sixty-one out of 100 words in

“familiar use by educated peo-
p1e'77

But the most amazing disclosure
is that the college seniors achieved
scores thirty per cent lower than
did high school seniors four years
younger.

These ﬁgures, even discounting
possibility of error or even of the
perhaps superﬁcial probing of the
tests, certainly indicate that there
is something wrong with the
methods of college instruction.
This “something” is undoubtedly
the false emphasis placed on the
credit system. "The rare student
with cultural leanings has been
made to abandon his pursuit of a
true education and join in that
mad academic struggle for cred-
its and diplomas.

A shift in emphasis is necessary
and inevitable.

It would be evidence of progres-
sive spirit on the part of the Uni-
versity Assembly if that body
were to study the report of the
Foundation with the purpose of

orienting the University Qurricu-
luni with a new type of education.

Spent Three Years Teaching English At Lingnan; Was
Outstanding In Undergraduate Life

 

By Charles B. Holstein

A part of the University’s “Pitt in
China” delegation is again back at
Pitt, it was disclosed to the Pitt
News late Saturday by a curious reg-
istration ofﬁcial.

Charles F. Seidle, C31, for three
years instructor in English "at the
University of Lingnan, in Lingnan,
China, has registered for a number of
courses in the Graduate school this
semester_

Mr. Seidle, a twin brother of N.
Robert Seidle, newly appointed as-
sistant to the dean of men, returned
to Pittsburgh last week. He arrived
in New York two weeks ago on the
Aquatania for his ﬁrst visit to this
country since he originally left in
1931.

L The former Lingnan instructor was
awarded his position immediately
after his graduation here. As an un-
dergraduate he was outstanding in
a large number of extra-curricular
activities, his major position having
been the championship of the board
of the,l931 Owl, senior yearbook. A
member of ODK, national honorary
activities fraternity, of Sigma Delta
Chi, national professional journalism
fraternity, of Theta Delta Psi, local
social fraternity (since merged into
the Pitt chapter of Theta Chi), and
of Phi Alpha Theta, national honor-
ary history fraternity, Mr, Seidle is

well known to a host of alumni and
faculty members. As a senior, he
was a member of Student council; he
also served on the YMCA cabinet for
three years and was listed in the
1931 Owl’s Hall of Fame, which in-
cluded the outstanding activities lead-
ers of his class.

Although he made no formal state-
ment Saturday, Mr. Seidle intimated
that his stay in China had been ex-
ceedingly interesting and enjoyable,
and he especially praised the unusual
advantages that section of China of-
fered tourists. His classes at Ling-
nan were composed entirely of
Chinese students, and were conducted
in English exclusively,

Saturday on campus for M1‘. Seidle
was scarcely more than a series of
back-slapping and hand-shaking sand-
wiched in between the routine of
registration as his former acquaint-
ances and teachers met him in the
Cathedral. His plans now call for at
least a year of further work in the
Graduate school. '

The University for the past num-
ber of years has been maintaining
a group of instructors and professors
at the University of Lingiian, the up-
keep of whom is largely met by an
annual tag day on campus, during
which students and faculty members
are asked to donate small sums. It
was through this arrangement that
Mr. Seidle was sent to China.

beled as a freshman number, con-
tains many new features in addition
to several of those retained from last
year.

Ritchie Assists British I
Museum Art Expedition

Andrew -C. Ritchie, a scholarship
appointee of the department of ﬁne
arts, has been selected by W, G. Con-
stable head of the Courtauld Insti-
tute of Art at London, as an assistant
to Mr. Kendrick of the British muse-
um on their next expedition, accord-
ing to a letter received by Walter H.
Hovey, professor and acting head of
the department. Mr. Kendrick is the
collector and keeper of ‘Celtic and
Saxon antiquities at the Museum. He
and Mr. Ritchie will set out to dig foi-
early Christian material at Gallen
priory in Ireland.

Mr. Ritchie received the scholar-
ship award for study at the Courtauld
institute for the year 1933-4, and a
renewal for the year 1934-5. He is
studying Scandinavian, Celtic, and
Anglo-Saxon art in an effort to trace
the mixture of Christian Roman tradi-l
tion with the barbaric traditions of
the Vikings.

Fingers off (A Shortened Story)
Frank and I were working on hot
pork sandwiches at the Broadway
Lunch when Geno came in with his

ringht hand bandaged. He works the

3:30 to 11:30 shift at the Falcon steel
plant.

Geno looked pretty green, and his
forehead was sweaty.

“Hello,” he said. He sat down at
the table with us. “How about a fag?”
I gave him a Wing.

“What happened to you, pal?” said
Frank. The Greek brought Geno a
glass of water.

“Coffee. Black,” said Geno. “Chip-
ped on‘ three ﬁngers down to the
ﬁrst joint.”

We looked at the hands he laid on
the white glass table top. We could
see in spite of the hefty bandages
that his three middle ﬁngers on his
right hand were shorter than those
of the left.

Geno had the longest ﬁngers of any
guy I’ve ever seen. '

“How’d it happen, Geno?” I said.

“Oh, I was ﬁttin’ a chain around a.
girder. The crane man lifted it a
little, and I thought everything was
okay. I started pushin’ on the end
of the girder to straighten it, and
then the hook slipped on the chain,
and I pulled my hand out of my
glove.”

Frank pushed his plate away and
lit a cigarette. I didn't like my pork
very much either, but I ﬁnished it.
The Greek brought the coffee.

The whistle blew midnight. “How
about tryin’ KDKA,” Geno said. “Paul
Pendarvis’s on.”

The Greek monkeyed around the
dials of the old tin box behind the
cash register. Pendarvis came on fast
and hot. We listened for a while.
Then the band started playing “Soph-
isticated Lady” with a swell piano
solo.

Geno looked at his hands, wiggled
his ﬁngers and touched them on the
table like he was playing the piano.
“Pendarvis knows how to play,” he
said, looking at the wall.

“Told your ol’ man yet?” said

Frank.
“No. That's the worst part about
it. I know he’ll throw a triple ﬁt.

The time has come, the walrus

Christ, he bawled the ﬁrst day I
went to work this summer. Well,
what are you going to do when you
don't have the dough?”

I didn’t like watching Geno turn
his hands and look at them.

“I guess you won't go back to
Oberlin this fall?" I said. I

“Guess not.”

That’s a hell of a dirty shame,”‘

Frank said_

VVe stayed till the Cotton Club pro-
gram was over. We paid the Greek
and went out where it was a lot
cooler.

“Say, boys, I’m going back to Ober-
lin this fall,” Geno said all of a. sud-
den. He bent up his left arm and
started sawing the air with his right.
“Violin.”

Frank slapped him on the back,
“Swell, kid, I’ll bet you’ll make Ru-
binoff and his ﬁddle look sick.”

Another Five Year Plan?

According to the Northeastern
News, Northeastern university expects
its freshman class to stay with them
for ﬁve years instead of the custom-
ary four years; the right ear of the
ﬁrst issue of the N. N. for this year
states “Northeastern welcomes the
class of 1939.” (Perhaps some of our
own freshmen will adopt the ﬁve year
plan, but at least we do not feel so
prophetic).

‘ Hi Gentlemen!

All, students and professors alike,
speak to each other at Virginia Tech.
The usual greeting is “Hi Gentlemen.”
The custom of speaking is considered
one of the school’s best traditions.
The freshman rules require freshmen
to speak, but freshmen after catching
the Tech spirit do not need to be re-
quired to speak; they do it volun-
‘tarily,

some one discovered that both teams

Questioning reporters at Columbia
university discovered that ﬁve out of
six people on the street believe that

Fine Arts Department
Adds Painter-Lecturer

Philip Elliot, a painter, who has re-
cently returned from four years in
Europe, has been appointed to an as-
sistant professorship in the depart-
ment of ﬁne arts. He will conduct a
lecture course in basic art principles,
and a practical course in the use of
various media of artistic expression.

Beginning his work in painting un-

der Eugene Savage at the Yale School '

of Fine Arts, Mr. Elliot worked on
mural decorations in New York “City,
and in 1930 was awarded the ‘Chal-
oner fellowship. From then until re-
cently his studio has been in Paris.
In 1929 he successfully organized an
art school in Waterbury, -Connecticut,
and conducted a class in design at
the College of the City of New York.
He is interested in the modern pos-
sibilities of photography as a gen-
uinely plastic form of expression, com-
-ing from his association with Ergy
Landau, the Hungarian photographer,
in Paris.

Between You,
Me And The

Lamp Post

By Wilbur D. Clark

i
The First Column

It is the custom for college column-
ists to blossom forth each year with
a first column on “Why I'm Writing
a Column,” which, just between you,
me and the lamp post, is unnecessary.
Every one knows that columnists col-
umn for one of two reasons: either,
for money or to appease that hunger
for self-expression which in other
is manifested by moustaches,
brilliant ties and purple shirts. Itried
a moustache with indifferent success;
ties and shirts cost money.

Somewhere in the ﬁrst effort of a
Pitt columnist one is bound to ﬁnd
Florence Fisher Parry referred to and
not with much respect. I did that
last year and already two others have
this year. “Hey, hey," the boys all
seem to think, “many people dislike
I DARE SAY, and so if I take a swat
at Florence the mob will be with me,
and my column will be read.” It
doesn't seem to ‘work out that way,
though. Thousands continue to read
Florence Fisher Parry night after
night, tsch-ing the whole way through,
while columns like these still ﬁll up
the space around the ads and ed-
itorials on page two of the News.

Anyhow, FF}: isn't so bad; She writes I lege senior, has a column in that new

a good column sometimes.

Another common paragraph in the
ﬁrst column is always the one about
“the purpose of this column.” Last
year the explanation I gave was,
“These words mark the resting place
of what was to have been a ‘literary’
column.” Grease, guns and manure
heaps, I maintained, had just as great
literary propensities as art galleries
and sunsets. That was a master-
stroke. Many delicate souls took an
active dislike to “that lamp post
column,” fancying that they were be-
ins ridiculed, and read the column
for se'~'reral months searching for
more thorns. This year, unfortunate-
ly, I cannot use the same explana-
tion. In fact there is no explanation
for it.

Hovey Lauds Background
Of Oriental Art Course

According to Walter H. Hovey, pro-
fessor and acting head of the ﬁne
arts department, the new course on
Oriental art offered by the depart-
ment will have as a background in
the ﬁne arts library one of the best
collections of material on Oriental art
in this country. The course will be
conducted by Mr. Hovey with lantern
slides and lectures. Two previous
courses in the line arts department
will be demanded as prerequisites, ex-
cept where sperial permission has
been given. During the summer sev-
eral shipments increasing the D1‘-
iginal Oriental stock were received.
These include ten cases of books,
each book a complete set of Japanese
art journals, and about seventy-ﬁve
scrolls of historical romances. Two of
the scrolls were on display during
registration week at the ﬁne arts ex-

hibit in Room 1001, Cathedral. Mr.
Hovey plans to stage a more com-
plete exhibit of the shipment later in

Starting Positions Gn Pitt

Grid Team

Still Undecided

 

VVitli hot battles still being fought
for ﬁrst team positions, the Pitt foot-
ball squad is beginning its home
practice sessions after two weeks
spent at Camp Hamilton, in the wilds
outside of Windber, Pennsylvania.
Five days of intensive drills are on
the books in preparation for the open-
ing game of the season, with Wash-
ington and Jefferson, on Saturday.

The two weeks of practice at camp
brought out the truth that there will
be several men contesting so hotly
for two or three positions that the
coaches are going to be hard put to
decide on a starting lineup,

At the end posts, it appears quite
certain that Harvey Rocker will start
at left end, while right end job is
pretty much of a toss-up between
Verne Baxter, sub last season, and
Leslie Wilkens, a converted center.

Bob Hoel is almost sure of the left
tackle position, Stan Olejniczak, Art
Detzel. and Abe Daniell are waging a
battle for the right tackle job. Ken
Ormiston and Frank Kutz appear to
be the class of the guards, who are
out to be the running mate of Captain
Hartwig. George Shotwell will likely
continue to shade Nick Kliskey in the
duel for center,

Miller Munjas looke like the starter
at quarterback, but neither Arnold.
Green nor Bob McClure may be count-
ed out of the running, The fullback-
ing will be done by Izzy.Weinstock,
with Rector as an understudy. The
left halfback job is one for which
there is quite a battle, Mike Nicksick
and Hube Randour being the gentle-
men in question. Nicksick appears to
have something of an edge after bril-
liant work during the latter part of
the camp training season_

Pitt’s right halfback will be one of
those things which is likely not to be
decided upon until the team lines up
or the opening kickoff. Bob LaRue,
good-looking Greensburg boy, is mak-
ing a determined bid for a starting
job in his ﬁrst season of varsity com-
petition. Bob is fast and is~ one of
the headiest players on the squad.
Vying with LaRue for the post is
Henry Vveisenbaugh, a converted full-
back. Weisenbaugh is best remem-
bered as Weinstock’s understudy last
year. Such an understudy was he
that Panther followers spent nights
thinking up ways to put two fullbacks
into the backﬁeld. There is a strong
possibility that the Tarentum ﬂash
may be used as a handy man behind
the line and not placed in the starting
lineup. Whatever may be the proce-
due, it is a sure thing that Henry
will have plenty of playing minutes to
his credit when the season is over.

‘Pitt followers will get a surprise
when the ﬁrst Pitt offense of the sea-
son swings into action, After years
and years of the methodical huddle
and lining up, Jlock Sutherland’s men
will use a shift this year to begin
their plays, There is nothing involved
about the shift, according to Suther-
land, and it makes only two steps
necessary for each man to get into
position from the initial formation.

Harrison Outlines Pitt Athletic
Program For Newcomers

 

 

Approximately 400 freshmen found
that the two hours spent at the ath-
letic assembly Wednesday afternoon
in Memorial hall was well worth
while. W. Don Harrison, director of
athletics, who was in charge of the
program, delivered a brief speech in
which he outlined the University’s
athletic program_

Mr. Harrison stated emphatically,

“Athletics are entirely a secondary

issue in undergraduate life on the
Pitt campus, class work being the
most important factor.”

The introduction of the coaches in
the various sports concluded the for-
malities. After the introductions, stu-
dents were given an opportunity to
report to the instructor of their fav-
orite sport.

Three new coaches were introduced:
Lieutenant Kleinman, coach of the
riﬂe team; Jack Schricker, coach of
the boxing team; and Bradford Ilsley,
assistant wrestling coach,

 

Football Managers: Notice

 

All students desiring to try out for
managers of the football team should

Whistle! Kick off! Signals! A
light snappy Panther football team
falls into formation; the ball is
snapped; 127 pounds of halfback tears 
into the line. He is playing footballl
for Pitt, and what's more his 127'
pounds is no extreme handicap, for
he is p-laying on the ﬁrst 150-pound
football team in Pitt’s athletic his-
tory. The old story, “I never had a
chance to play football at Pitt; I
weighed only 145 pounds soaking wet,”
is out. The athletic department
spoiled that one by sponsoring a team
for students who weigh less than 150
pounds,

Bob Hogan and John Meredith,’

quarterback and tackle respectively
on last year's varsity football team,
will coach the squad.

Wyhat.’ No Golden Panthers?

News that Pitt’s football players
will wear white jerseys, with blue
trimmings, this year causes at least
one signiﬁcaant problem. No longer
will sports writers, in search of syn-
nonyms and words with which to ﬁll
up headlines_ be able to employ the:
name “Golden Panthers."

The Pitt News will welcome any
suggestions coming from students’
concerning just what we may now,
call these boys since they are not
longer “Golden Panthers." If there

appears to be enough suggestions of-
fered, the News will endeavor to turn
the whole thing into some sort of a
contest, with appropriate judges de-
termining the most ﬁtting and catchy
name. There may be even a prize
for the winner.

Along with the white jerseys, the
Panthers will be outﬁtted in khaki

colored pants of airplane cloth. The
pants will have blue stripes up the
back. Headgears will be of solid blue_
As a change, the Panthers may use
blue jerseys with gold numbers.

Men's Health Service
Rep 0 rts Results
Of Survey

_The Student Health service of Falk
clinic has held its annual Freshman
physical examinations this summer as
usual, and all the freshmen are re-
ported as “doing nicely.” Under the
watchful eye of Dr. H. Clifford Carl-
son and Dr. George Kowallis, the
freshman men have been saying their
“oh’s” and “ah’s” much in the same
manner as other freshman classes
have done, and the examinations are
rapidly drawing to completion.

A comparison between the classes
of 1937 and 1938 shows that 537 fresh-
men were eiirolled a.t the clinic on
September 14, 1933, whereas 658 were
registered there on that date this
year. By the 14th last year 250 had
been examined, while 353 have been
checked over to date this year, The
majority of the freshmen this year
are local men, almost three-fourtlis of
them coming from Pittsburgh and
vicinity.

-Silhouettes have been taken as in
other years to help the freshmen cor-
rect their postural defects. Special
recommendations have been made to
the physical education department for
the correction of ﬂaws in the new-
comers’ physical makeup.

Dr. Carlson, are more tense and de-
