MC Introduces Change

In Government For Men

By MILLARD AlVIDUE
Men’s Council reached a “momentous decision,” as ad-

iiiwvisor Jack Hardman stated, at their lengthy meeting last

Wednesday evening, February 27. A basic change in the
government of the male student body was approved by the
group. This new system of men’s government will “incor-
porate all facets of men’s student-directed life at Pitt.”

Although the details for the:

program (to be incorporated in a
new constitution) are not yet deﬁ-
nite, the basic structure was de-
bated and decided upon" at this
meeting. The system is somewhat
similar to that of the U. S. gov-
ernment. Three areas of authority

 exist—-executive, legislative, and

judicial. ,

The ﬁve members of the ex-
ecutive committee will be elect-
ed by the total male student
population. The offices to be
ﬁlled will be: president, chief-
justice, vice-president, secretary,
and treasurer. The executive
committee will conduct meetings
of Men’s Council, and represent
Pitt men in various areas of the
University. The chief justice
would preside over the second
of the three areas of govern-
ment, the judicial. -

Besides this elected official on the

Men’s Court, four to six other

‘justices will serve, although the

method of selection is still under
discussion. Council favored a small
representative groupfor the court.
Debate was long on the question of
conflicting’ authority between IF
and MC judiciary commissions. It
was ﬁnally resolved that Men’s
Council would judge violations of
University regulations by indi-
vidual fraternity men.

The legislative body of the
men’s governmental set-up will
retain the name of Men’s
Council. This will consist of the
ﬁve members of the executive
committee, the presidents of the
four classes of the college and
E&M, two representatives from
both business administration and
education, and one man from
school of pharmacy. The addi-

The faculty portion ofthe com-
mittee is headed by Jack Hard-
man, assistant to the dean of men.

legiate Conference on Govern-
ment, an organization for the study
of government, will play an im-
portant part in the administration
of student elections. Their repre-
sentative has not as yet been nam-
ed to the committee.

At its ﬁrst meeting held last
week, the committee recognized
“in principle” the existence of po-
litical parties for the spring elec-
tions to be subject to the regula-
tions to be determined by the com-
mittee this week.

Term Ends, Time Begins

  Thief Flunks  But May Get Degree

By IRV JACOBS

John Farmer, student in
burglarology, visited the Pitt
campus last week to perform
his last experiment of the
semester. Unfortunately, con-
ditions were unfavorable for
successful completion of his study
in “Pilfering From Frat Houses.”
John met dismal failure in his
academic quest, and it may be a
long “term” before he can resume
work again.

Lack of good procedure could in
no way be the blame for John’s
unfortunate result. A veteran
burglar, he made careful prepara-
tions to insure a successful job.

His procedure was to visit the
darkened fraternity houses ‘in
the still of night, and to pilfer
unconcealed valuables from the
sleeping fraters’ rooms. His tech-
nique was simple, but effective.
He parked his shoes at the front
door, and silently stole his way
through the rooms, wearing a
large black concealing overcoat.

The first part of the experiment
ended successfully at 2:00 a.m. as

NewOfficial
Named By  
Litchfield

At the termination of his
position as director of Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhowe1:’s
Committee on Education Be-
yond the High School, Mr. El-

vis J. Stahr, Jr., will become

vice chancellor of the University
of Pittsburgh’s professional
schools.

Stahr, a former Rhodes scholar
and law teacher. is currently on
leave from a position as provost
at the University of Kentucky. He
will take over his duties at Pitt
next July 1.

In announcing his appointment,
Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield
said, “Mr. Stahr’s primary re-
sponsibility will be to serve as a
catalyst and leader to reinforce
those common threads of profes-
sional interests which run through
the Various professional schools
of the University.”

Thrce Chancellors ‘

“With his help,” Dr. Litchfield
added. “we should be able to see
even more clearly the possibilities
for reinforcing common interests
at the professional level. These
opportunities are implicit in the
programs of engineering and busi-
ness administration, for instance,

social work and retailing and
business affairs, or in the school
of law in relation to all.”

Stahr will also assist in de-
veloping the recently announced
graduate school of public affairs.

He will be one of three chan-
cellors of the.University. One, Dr.
Robert A. Moore, is in charge 01
the Schools of the Health Pro-
fessions. A third, who is to be in
charge of the disciplines and un-
dergraduate college, has not yet
been named.

Outstanding Undergraduate

A native of Kentucky, Stahr
achieved a notable scholastic re-
cord while taking his undergrad-
uate degree at the University of
Kentucky. He was president of
his senior class and of Sigma Chi
fraternity, co-captain of the vars-
ity tennis and debate teams, cadet

of Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa.

From 1939 to 1947 he practic-
ed law in New York City, ex-
cept fol four years that he spent
as an infantry officer in World
War 11 during which he rose to
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
He served overseas for more

rated ﬁve ‘imes.

Stahr left New York in 1947 to
join the faculty of the University
of Kentucky College of Law as
associate professor.

He received the Distinguished
Service Award of the United
States Junior Chamber of Com-
merce as one of America’s ten
outstanding young men of 1948,
being selected for that honor by
a committee which included Presi-
dent Eisenhower.

Students, Fclty Get Together

Discussion Groups
Help To Acquaint
School “Friends”

By DWIGHT FONG

“A closer relationship be-
tween student and faculty is
needed here at Pitt. We hope
we can create it with the stu-
dent discussion groups we are
holding at the professors’

homes.”

This was the statement of Nancy
Turenko, Col. ’58, co-chairman
with Joseph Wynard, Col. ’59, of
the Student-Faculty Committee.
The program, under the auspices
of the Pitt YM-YWCA, is design-
ed not only to bring students and
professors together, but it allows
the students to become acquainted
with more people and at the same
time integrate their university
learning.

Six groups of six to ﬁfteen stu-
dents each have been organized.
They meet at the home of their
sponsoring professors once every
four or six weeks to exchange
ideas on subjects that the students
have chosen themselves. More
groups‘ are being organized to
make the plan an integral part
of Pitt.

Faculty Cooperated

The faculty members in the
program have been enthusiastic
about it and have cooperated very
well, Miss Turenko added. “But
we do need some more student
participation. We want to have 20
to,25 groups formed by the end of
the semester and 100 within ﬁve
or six years.”

Dr. Joseph Zasloff of the De-
partment of Political Science,
whose group met for the ﬁrst
time last week, said that he was
pleased with the meeting. “The
students discussed religion and
their own religious beliefs,” he
said. “It was quite worthwhile
and offered a good opportunity
to meet people of varied back-
grounds.”

Faculty members hosting _groups
are Dr. Arthur Kannwischer of
the philosophy department; Mr.
Virgil Cantini, ﬁne arts; Dr. Z_as-
loﬁ and Mrs. Marion Finkelhor,
political science; Mr. Lawrence
Lee, English; Dr. Lewis Diana,
sociology; and Dr. Robert E. Carl-
son, Dr. James H. C. Liu, and Dr.
Raymond Brittain, history.

I Meetings Formed

Meetings are formed by the
committee which invites students
living near the home of a par-
ticipating professor. The ﬁrst meet-
ing is scheduled by the commit-

tee, but the students set the time ~

and subject of succeeding meet-‘
ings. To maintain contact among
the group, a report of each meet-
ing is ﬁled with the Y ofﬁce.

(Continued from Page 1)
John completed a successful tour
of the Phi Ep house. Moving on to
greater conquests in the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house, however,
John was to find other scholastic
pursuits in direct conﬂict with this

_ project.

There, Hank Fisher, Col. ’60,
found conditions ideal for work
in a criminological experiment.
He was studying alone in one of
the rooms when he became aware
of somebody moving through the
hall. On interrogating the intru-
der, he became suspicious of
John's motives when John ex-
plained that he was looking for
Seton Hill College. Moments later,
Hank, a former marine, made a
ﬂying tackle of the ﬂeeing bur-
glary student.

In the tussle that followed,
wrestler John Bellas joined in
and convinced the intruder that
“You’re not going anywhere.”

The failure of Farmer’s work
became obvious shortly afterward
when the “data” he had collected
was identiﬁed. Included in his loot
were four suitcases, a checkbook,
and several wallets containing
some $400 in cash.

This marks the second failure
that John suffered since the fall
term began. He- was currently
serving a probationary term since
his failure in a related course. on
“Pilfering From Sorority Houses”
taken from a school in Cleveland.
This necessarily delays his ac-
quisition of the B.S., but there is
still a very good chance that he
will get the degree. ‘

- Debating Diplomats

Perhaps the editors of Time magazine should have in-
cluded one more claim to fame for the University of Pitts-

burgh beside the Cathedral of Learning and the football S

team. The Men and Women’s Debating Associationshave
proven again their overwhelming superiority in college
ranks by taking top honors in two annual tournaments.

MDA scored one of the greatest victories in the history
of collegiate debating when they took ﬁrst and second
place in the tourney at McGill University in Montreal. Never
before had this tournament "witnessed a ﬁnishing round in
which two teams from the same school had to debate each
other to break their tie for ﬁrst place.

To accomplish it was necessary for the men to defeat
such teams as Columbia, N.Y.U., and Cornell. All of these
teams are topnotch and Cornell was fresh from a ﬁrst
place in the tournament at Johns Hopkins.

Women’s Debating Association carried home the ﬁrst

place trophy and the Best Debater trophy from the Mount
Mercy Tournament. Sixty college men and women took
part in the meet and this was the ﬁrst time that all the top
awards were won by women.

The value of this type of representation of the Univer-

sity student body on campuses in this country and other

countries can not be overestimated.

In a much more academic way the debaters are bring-
ing national recognition to the school that is known» for
football and a skyscraper. At least a great measure of re-
spect for the teams from Pitt is growing in the opinions of
college debate societies across the nation—a ﬁtting trophy
for two ﬁne groups of academic ambassadors. JM

The Four-HourWonder

By Jay Butler

To mention any change in the provincial com-
position of the Pitt student body is like mention-
ing matches in a powder house. Joe Student sup-
poses that he is in no position to choose, and he
faces the possibility of change with either a shud-
der or an oath. For him, things are _ﬁne as they
are. _
_ Pitt has been and is a provin-
cial school. Time magazine
placed the proportion of students
from within the the state at 94%
of the student body. In its
chosen role Pitt fulﬁlls a speci-
ﬁc purpose, that of providing a
maximum of higher education
forthose who are not capable of
leaving the Pittsburgh area. So
far this role has ‘never been
seriously questioned.

But now things are changing. There is a rumb-
ling in chambers of the oracles. and somebody up
there is saying the status quo is no longer good
enough, provincialism must go. There are rumors
of increases in tuition and the proportion of out-
of-state students. At this point Joe Student be-
gins to shake his ﬁst. He feels that he is getting
a satisfactory education at Pitt; and further, that
Pitt is the only place he can get it.

A Flaws in Education

I propose, however, that in reality neither is
true. A careful examination of the matter reveals
not only that there are flaws in education at Pitt,
but that Pitt is not" the only place many students
can or should be educated, and that for the rest,
the Pitt system must be made more complete and
mor effective. Allow me to explain this heresy.

Pitt is failing to educate the total man. It is
failing in nearly one case out of two to even keep
the student long enough to graduate him. This
failure is a result of what I have deﬁned earlier
in this column as an unsuccessful attempt to re-
concile massive ducation with the needs of the
individual. I do not propose, as some of my critics
would have me understood, that we install at-
tendants to hold the student’s hand during ﬁnal
exams. However, experience teaches us that the

process of ducation is successful only so far as it

meets the needs of the individual.

Personal Contacts

Now, is it possible to educate as an individual the
four-hour wonder who checks in at eight—thirty,
drives straight through to twelve-thirty, and then
grabs a streetcar for work? Does he have time for
the essential personal contacts with his teachers
and that intense preoccupation with education

The Harvard Grad . . .

Five Years After

 

which are so necessary to a valuable university ex-
perience?

Pitt has this advantage over the small campus
school; it is not isolated from the reality of life
around it. Pitt is a part of the larger dynarncis of
the city, moving and changing in that greater stir
of life. But there is a danger too. There is the
danger that the energies essential to education and
the time essential to its processes be dissipated like
water spreading on a blotter. This is what has
happened at Pitt. Ideally, Pitt would give the ad-
vantage of both campus and city school.

Contrast the learning potential of the four-hour
wonder with that of the full-time resident student.
It is simply not reasonable that these two so ir-
reconcilable quantities be forced to share the same
institutional container. To separate the former is
not so cold-blooded as it may seem. They are few,
and it is in their interest that they be regarded as
a unit and educated separately.

Exchange of Ideas

There is another group of students who do not
belong at Pitt. They are those who are capable of
going some place else. This has nothing to‘ do with
a qualitative comparison between Pitt and any other
school. A university is a place for the exchange
of ideas. For such an exchange there must first
be diversity. Diversity, of course, exists to a de-
gree; but that similar regional backgrounds pro-
duce similarities in values and culture is a fact. that
need not be elaborated.
those making use of facilities unique at Pittsburgh,
who are ﬁnancially or scholastically capable of «go-
ing elsewhere would do so, their own educational
experience would be more valuable, and their
places could in turn be filled at Pitt by out-of—state
students. ’

Finally. by careful admissions procedure and
counseling, only those students should be admit-
ted to the University who have made their de-
cisions on mature bases and who are mentally capa-
ble of college level work. Case in point: not a
fewtgood bricklayers have been drawn by the
current hue and cry of test—tube propaganda into
areas where they do not belong.

These are not solutions. "They are possibilities

for improvement which consider both the needs“

of the individual and the requirements of the area.
If the student looks wth horror at the prospect of
abandoning provincialism, it is because he has

been fooled into believing that its ruin is his own.

It is not. We need not call in the Destroying Angel
to get on the. road to repair. It is only necessary to
abandon the foolishness of mumbling at the oracles
and to settle down to rationalland svst'ematic cor-
rection of what has become a bad situation.

What ﬁeld to
major in, what
activities, if
any, to participate in, and choice
of friends are probably the main
areas in which the individual
can make the decision which will
best suit him or one which he
will later regret.

Since experience is reputed to
be the best teacher, perhaps an
insight into‘ some of the joys, re-
grets, and present positions of
recent graduates might both give
one an idea of what to expect,

' and at the same time what to

avoid.

Questionnaires Senf
Last summer, to gain data for
future counseling and advising,
- the Harvard University Office of
Student Placement and the
Office of Tests sent question-
naires to the 1,047 men who re-
ceived their bachelor’s -degree

 

from Harvard in 1952. The ques-
tions covered in considerable
detail the graduate’s job, marital
status, reading habits, future
plans, and past regrets. The con-

sensus of replies compiled from.

the 817 questionnaires received
were as folows.

“The most frequently—encoun-
tered graduate of ﬁve years is
married, has one child, votes
Republican, goes to church once
a month, and lives in a large
northeastern city. He is in busi-
ness and \is convinced that his
education, though unrelated to
his work in any sense, is the
preparation he would choose if
he had the choice again.”

“He regrets that he didn’t
look much more thoroughly into
career opportunities while still
an undergraduate, a n d isn’t
quite sure whether he thinks the
fault is his own, or Harvard’s.
He wishes he had more respon-
sibility in his job, and would
like to be making more than his
present $5,000 (the average sal-
ary) per year.”

Every major profession is re-
presented, and salaries range
from a medical student’s annual
deﬁcit of $1,000 to a stockbrok-
er’s income of $25,000 plus.

Need Cc,-ounseling

More than one—ﬁfth of the
graduates replying were enough

in doubt about their present‘ jobs
-’ or careers to indicate that they
wouldnowi like vocational coun-

seling. J This "was more common

among teachers, men at present
in the service, and among men in
business (regardless of present
income).

Military life touched 55 per-

/ cent of those replying, with re-

actions as to the value of serv-
ice time varying in every cat-
egory. Officers, however, were
more if r e q u e n tly enthusiastic
than their enlisted counterparts.
Several ex—enlisted men who
joined upon graduation felt
strongly that their lives would
have been far better arranged it
they had finished their military
obligation either before College,
or between sophomore and jun-
ior years.

Outrage and frustration seem-
ed to reach their peak among
enlisted graduates of law and
business schools.

Common Criticism

A former mathematics student
mirrored the only common crit-
icism of College training, when
he said “The faculty should do
more to provide undergraduates
with an awareness of unsolved
problems, so that a man thinking
of a research career can look to-
ward areas which challenge
him.”

The majority of those who
went to law school felt that they
might well have invested more
time in writing, philosophy, or
mathematics (to sharper. their
powers ofreasoning) at the ex-
pense-of some of the government
and economics courses taken as

school.

Dr. Teagarden received her
bachelor’s degree in 1915, and her
master’s degree in 1916. Her only
year of absence from the Pitt fac-
ulty was in 1924, when she stu-
died for and received her doctor’s
degree at Columbia University.
She also spent one summer teach-
ing at Mills College, Oakland,
Calif.

Teaching was not Dr. Tea-

since her graduation. Her clinic-
al practice has been divided

Win Streak Foiled
At 26; Strategies
Highlight Thriller

By CHRIS GILLOTTI

Penn‘ State Coach Charlie
Speidel’s strategy worked per-
fectly and Rex Peery’s back-
ﬁred as the Nittany Lions
edged the Panther matmen,
14-11, Saturday night to snap
a 26 meet winning streak.

Although ‘Peery admitted be-
forehand that this would be one
of his toughest meets, few fans
gave the Lions, who went into the
meet with a mediocre 5-2-1 re-
cord, much of a chance to prevent
the Panthers from completing an-
other undefeated season.

In the opening 123-pound
match, Eastern champ Sid Nod-
land had a tough time with Bill
Hulings, but came on strong in

the third period to decision him,
5-1.

Ed Peery tied the score in the '

130-pound event with a close 5-4
win over Johnny Johnson, hand-
ing the Eastern champ his ﬁrst
loss. Peery started off fast and

built up a 4-0 score in the second
‘period, but Johnson caught ﬁre in

the last stanza and the one point
awarded for riding time was
needed to give Peery the match.
John Pepe seemed just too much
for Vic DeFelice as he coasted to
a 6-1 decision. Then in the 147-
pound class the Lion strategy be-
gan to pay off. Peery chose to
throw Ted Bienkowski in against
undefeated Dave Adams. Spiedel
then withdrew Adams’s name and
sent in Carl Poust. It proved a
smart move as Poust held Bien-
kowski to a 1-1 draw.
Bob Bubb and Adams were
matched at 157 pounds. Adams
squeezed out a 7-5 decision and

DECISIVE MATCH—-The Panthers’ Bob Richardson (177 pounds)
desperately tries to escape from Penn State’s Les Walters in the
ﬁnal period of their deciding struggle at the Memorial Field
House Saturday night. Richardson, hampered by a severe nose
bleed, dropped a 4-1 decision to Walters which clinched the State
win over Coach Rex Peery’s grapplers who were seeking their
27th consecutive dual meet victory over a three-year span. Ron
Schirf’s windup win only closed the scoring gap to 14-11 in

favor of State.
I! II: #

Penn State led 11-5 in the run-
ning score. With only three
matches remaining, Peery chose
Dave Johnson to go against
Bruce Gilmore at 167 pounds.
Johnson easily decisioned him,
6-1.

Bob Richardson then went in
against Les Walters who notice-
ably outweighed him. Richardson
put up a. good ﬁght, but dropped
a 4-1 decision, and the Lions
clinched the meet. As an anticli-
max, Ronnie Schirf remained un-
defeated as he easily whipped

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

 

 

Basketball Coach Bob Timmons, speaking with the con-
viction of a Socrates, says, “I am satisﬁed with the perform-
ance of my team this year.” Now this may come as -a sur-
prise to many who feel that the team hould have compiled a
much better record than 15-9. After all the Panther mentor
had a well—balanced quintet in addition to Don Hennon. At
just themention of Pitt basketball this heckling minority could give
you many reasons why the Jungle Cats should have lost no more

 han three to ﬁve games. Timmons felt different, and openly ex-
' pressed his beliefs at the beginning of the season when he went on
record with the prediction that the locals would win 14 and drop ten.

The Panther tutor is ﬁrmly convinced that his ﬂoormen have
measured up to expectations. Here ishis case:

“The lackvof depth greatly hurt us,” says Timmons. “Take
the Orange Bowl classic for example. We were called upon to play
three tough games against Seaton Hall,.Western Kentucky, and
Connecticut on successive nights. By the time we reached the
overtime of the Connecticut game we were dead tired. I had no
adequate reserves to replace the starters who fouled out. This
was the championship contest but we didn’t quite have the man-
power to dump them after Hennon fouled out.” ‘

The likeable Timmons explained\ that the loss of veteran Phil
Kleiman an dsophomore Mike Polagyi deﬁnitely hurt the team. “If

possibly have won two or three games that we otherwise lost in
the late. stages.” '
Another reason Timmons gives to support his prediction is the
schedule. He offers: “This was the toughest card I have been called
on to face in my four years as head coach. We played some of the
strongest teams in the country. We played Big Ten leaders Ohio
. State and Michigan, the Southern Conference champion, West Vir-
ginia, and powerful Southeastern foes in Duke and North Carolina
State. Also, you can’t forget the local opponents. They were all
toughies. Penn Stateand Duquesne were the big ones, but the small
schools always consider the Pitt tussle the “big one.” Ttnay go all
out every minute of the game. There is nothing they like more
than to beat Pitt.”
These must be the reasons, _then, that Timmons smiles when the
hecklers try to corner him. He feels that he has conquered the

Peery explained that he switch-

cause he felt that Richardson, the
less experienced of the two, could
handle Walters, while Johnson
was needed against Gilmore be-

Same T ale Again -White
Stars As Tankers Lose

By MURRAY CHASS .
Warne White, Panther captain, salvaged what little glory
the local swimmers had Saturday night as they closed out
their dual meet schedule, losing their sixth consecutive one
to Miami (Ohio), 58-28, in the Pittsburgh Athletic Associa-

195'7—TlIE 1-rrr mws._m. 7.

White, who was one of the few standouts for Coach Ben

Grady this season, captured both¢
the 220- and 440-yard freestyle
events for more than one-third of
his team’s total score.

The only other Panther win
was achieved by Ed Robson in the
200-yard breastroke.

Resemble NC State
Miam1’s John Humpries was an-
other double winner as he too
picked up two ﬁrst places in free-
style events. His victories came in
the 50- and 100-yard sprints.
Humpries also was a member of
the Redskins’ victorious 400-yard
freestyle relay quartet.

After the defeat, which gave
the locals as ﬁnal 1-8 record,
Grady commented, “This team
(Miami) is the same as _North
Carolina State. They had three
good all-around swimmers in
Glenn Bohan, John Humphries,
and Dennis O’Brien.”

North Carolina State beat the

Panthers earlier in the season, 50-
35, and it was a coupleof versatile
mermen who did the most dam-
age. ’

Besides Humphries’ ﬁne display
of ability, the other two boys that
Grady mentioned came up with
better than adequate perform‘-
ances. O’Brien won the 200-yard
butterﬂy, and was on both win-
ning relay teams.

Bohan took the 200-yard back-
stroke and then helped the free-
style relay team to its victory.

Both O’Brien and Bohan set
new pool records in their in-
dividual wins. O’Brien swam
the butterﬂy in 2:23.78, and
Bohan covered the backstroke
in 2:19.7.

The Redskins’ 400-yard medley
relay team made it a trio of new
marks with their 4115.2 time in
the opening event,
