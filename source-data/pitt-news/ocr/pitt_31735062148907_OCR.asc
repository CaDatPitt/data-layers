features this year.

Managing Editor Kenneth
Speckhals, ChE ’59 and Copy

up at the request of the executive
committee.

The report noted that “the
history of pep assemblies at Pitt
is simply a repeated story of
bad relations between the peo-
ple involved and Student Con-
gress Assemblies Committees.”

A major cause of friction be-
tween the planners and particip-
ants is lack of advance informa-
tion as to the program or dates
of the rallys.

Situation Rectiﬁed

This situation is presently being
rectified through “better, relations
with the people concerned, parti-

will be asked for suggestions for

part of the program.”

“Student Congress, Mr. Michel-
osen, the team,
should not be made fools by tak-
ing part in a rally in which only
a small group of students partici-
pate.

“We should not plan a pep
assembly just to have a pep as-
sembly. Let the students want
one, and we will capitalize on
that spirit, but not until then.”

Pitt undergraduate Linda
Greer’s piano recital slated for
Mon._. Oct. 21 has been cancelled
as anassembly program due to
inavailability of proper piano
facilities. '

E&M Students Apply

F or Travel, Training

‘ The Engineering and Mines Travel and Training Pro-
gram Award will be given again this year according to Rich-
’ ard Lampert, Min. ’58, student chairman of the EMITT Com-

mittee.

Sponsored by the Engineering and Mines Cabinet, the
award is a grant of $500 and is given to an engineering stu-

dent for travel and study in Europe.

Applications will be made a

Nov. 18. The recipient of the

award should be decided upon by
the end of November. The name
of the student ‘chosen must be
given to the International Asso-
ciation for Exchange of Students
for Technical Experience by mid-
January.

..Al1 Engineering and Mines
seminars will feature last year’s
awardees, Donald Hoover and

" Donald Wise, who will discuss
the program and their experiences

abroad.

In a booklet published by the
school IAESTE is described as
a “non-proﬁt organization which
helps students of engineering
and the sciences to obtain sum-
mertime on-the-job training
with an industrial company in

‘ a foreign country.” 
It goes on to say that the asso-
ciation was founded in 1948 by
the universities and industries of
nine western European countries,
and has over 2000 industries in 21
countries providing training for
visiting students. , - ,
The program works in the fol-
lowing way: a student applies
through this school first, then to
the national committee, which

. sends the applications of several

candidates to the country in which
they have chosen to work. The
Jiational committee of the ex-

.V change country sends a descrip-

tion of the candidate’s qualiﬁca-
tions to one of the participating
companies. ‘

If the corporation accepts the

student, he gets assistance: in
tmaking travel plans, getting a
visa, and obtaining insurance.
The student, however, pays his
own travel expenses.

The awardee works for at least
eight weeks for the corporation
which pays him a maintenance
allowance to cover his living ex-
penses. '

Awardee Selected

A ‘fund of $500 was set up, an
awardee selected, and the name,
title of EMITT accepted by the
Pitt committee. A local corpora-
tion contributed another $500, and
one of the Nationality Room
Councils added to that. Another
company established engineering
contacts abroad.

Lampert stressed that Pitt’s
‘program is different from that
of the other 24 colleges and
universities which participate
in IAESTE in that it is the only ’
one which oriented and financed
a candidate.

He also related that the com-
is interested in drawing
some Pittsburgh companies into
the program.

Dragging furniture with a
clothesline more than a mile

" across‘ the Alaskan snow at
«fifteen degrees below zero
‘Was the immediate result of

Captain’ Ralph Paige’s un-
expected assignment to the Uni-
versity.

”j’The ijiewly named assistant pro-
iessor of Air Sciences was spend-
ing some leisure time with his

family in their log cabin sixty

i miles from Fairbanks when word
appointment came last
“At ﬁrst,” he said, “we

didn't know» what to do with the

 

 furniture, most of which belonged
xgto Uncle Sam.”

Taught ‘Pole Vaulters’
During his two years in Alaska
.where he was an instructor in
navigation at the Fairbanks Air-
base, the ﬂyer was a member of
the .:“polev vaulters” reconnaissance

 squad. He made about ninety mis-

 

  
  

E

i

  

,sions over the North Pole to
‘gather intelligence information.
; Each ﬂight lasted sixteen hours
«I and most of them were made in
weather forty degrees below.

 The captain outlined the haz-

ards of these missions because
at the pole “there are no means
of ‘navigating-—no radios. There
is. only celestial guidance.”
Compasses are no help because
they are magnetized by the
pole, he went on to say. ,.

., The instructor was also a mem-
‘ber of “Operation Ice Skate” in

mwhich the Air Force established

an ice island in the Arctic Ocean,

. some 480 miles from the pole.

Ice Island

 They took in American troops

A-in connectioriwith the Interna-

_ i tional Geophysical Year which at-

“tempts to inhabit ice packs for

scientiﬁc purposes, ' according to
Mtghe captain. Both the Americans
and the Russians occupy some of
these ice islands.

COLLEGE DAYS——Captain Ralph F. Paige, a graduate of the Uni-
versity who was recently appointed to the Department of Air Sci-
ence, points out scenes of his college days from the OWL to Ser-
geant John Cable. He reads “This has been a great year for Pitt . . .”

The new assistant told about
the closely knit 1ife"tat the air-
base as a result of so few peo-
ple. “Everything was done in a
pretty big way. We had dances
together and such affairs as Val-
entine parties. Everything cen-
tered around the Oﬂicer’s Club.”

The Captain’s wife and three
children-—-aged three, six, and
nine were all with him at the
base. “The family suffered
through the winters with me,” he
declared, “But my wife wasn’t too
fond of overnight in the cabin.”

Snow Shoes Used
They used the cabin as a week-
end retreat. It was on Birch Lake,
sixty miles from Fairbanks, and
lacked light, water, heat, and gas,

9;>,mi‘\lC.‘llQ\l%
 WZZa/ll’

and a road. This made it neces-
sary for them to use snow shoes
for over a mile.

Once he and Mrs. Paige took
the children in search of a
Christmas tree in the area of
the cabin. The weather was 25
below, and they had no snow
shoes for breaking the trail. Al-
though they saw the cabin
about 100 yards away they were,
bogged down too deeply and
had to turn back.

Captain Paige says, “I am glad
to be back.” He added that the
children, although they have an
adjustment to make, are happy
too because both sets of their
grandparents are in Pittsburgh.

 lime To Move

There has been a great reduction in the service availa-

lible in the Blue Tuck Shop during the past few weeks.

There has been a corresponding increase in student com-
plaints about the service. ' o ’

The use of paper cups and plates in the Tuck Shop
has been received as an unjustiﬁable attempt to decrease
costeof operation. Some students have dogmatically pro-
claimed that the University has decided that the expense
ofopening the cafeteria and new Hunt Room will be made
up by cutting the cost of operation of the Tuck Shop.

Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact, al-
most the contrary is true.

Decrease in service in the Tuck Shops is not only jus-
tiﬁable, it is an outright attempt to accomplish just what
it is accomplishing. That is to drive the autonomical zom-
bies who have the Tuck Shop ﬁxation into the facilities of
the Union, _ A '

It seems that some— will need the ultimate removal of

Rotten Apples  

By Gordon Clowneya S

Two weeks ago in Copiague, New York, a com-
_munity of 7,000, a man by the name of Delgado, his

/

iwife, and two daughters moved into a small $85

a.month home.
A This may not seem like an unusual, signiﬁcant,
or newsworthy happening, but the events that f9l-
lowed ’made it so. It seems that
Delgado, who is of Spanish
descent and has olive skin, was
apparently .mistaken for a Negro
by some members of this all
white community.

What followed was a series of
telephone calls to Delgado’s land-
lord expressing racial hatred
and threatening violence to the
family if it remained. The land-

 

he did not care whether his
tenants were Negro or white, informed Delgado

J \and his family of the threatening calls.

Delgado immediately packed  his family and
moved them out of the community and back to at-
tic quarters he. shared with his father. Delgado
said, “My kids couldn’t sleep after they heard about
the threats.” - ,

Residents of this Long Island community have,
by ‘now, realized their mistake and, since learning
that the family is white, would apparently accept
the Delgados back without further incident. But
Delgado» said last Wednesday that even though

he now might be left alone, he did not care to re— ‘

turn. “I don’t want to live near people like that,”
he said. “I want my kids to grow up in a decent
place.”
Greatest Mistake » M
But have the residents of Copiague who were
responsible for the prejudice and threats directed
toward this family actually realize their mistake?
It’s doubtful if they have, for the greatest mistake
thesepeople and others like them make is not in

disabled World War II veteran who was wounded.
twice and captured by the Germans, asked: “How;
can you‘ ﬁgure this kind of thing out? I thought ”

But a person’s past record, or the kind of peo-

However, when it was learned that the famil

Few happenings will point up stronger than this‘
one the silliness, and ignorance, upon which preju,

Panthers Seek Win
Over Strong Cadets

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The Panther football team, with three consecutive wins
on their luminescent record, travel East this Saturday to be-
gin serious combat for the mythical Eastern grid champion-
ship. The always improving Blue and Gold will invade up-
state New York to tackle a revenge-minded Army team.

At West Point, the Cadetswill attempt to bounce back

from last week's upset loss toO

Notre Dame, 23-21. The Sky-
scraper operatives will take the
ﬁeld at 2 o’clock to extend their
streak before a sell-out crowd of
27,000. -

The Jungle Cats will probably

:be slight underdogs at game time

due to their initial loss to Okla-
homa and the Black Knights’ im-
pressive win over Penn State and

' the home town edge. Anything
.1 can happen, however, once the

opening kickoff sails down th'e
ﬁeld, since the "previous games
between these two teams have
produced nip and tuck affairs,

i from start to ﬁnish.

Bowen Ready To Go
The Panthers will go into the
West Point fray as physically ﬁt

' as they have been since the cam-

paign lid lifter. Nebraska game
cripples Bill Kaliden, Jim Theo-
dore, and Dick Bowen «should be
at near-normal condition for the
battle. Kaliden’s badly bruised
hiphas responded well to rest.
Theodore’s trick knee appears
to have adequately healed. And
with a little bit of luck, Bowen
should be ready to ramble for the
ﬁrst time since Oklahoma.

Bowen’s strained ankle ‘is in

running form once again, and -

the husky" blonde should be
anxious to resume his line
bucking chores. But whether he
will take to the Michie Stadium
turf as a starter or not, may not
be resolved until game time.
Bowen’s two understudies Bob

Stark and Fred Riddle have per-
formed excellently in his place;
thus, he may have a battle on
his hands to get back into the
first eleven.

This ﬁght for the fullback job

is aghealthy sign for Coach John‘

Michelosen’s heretofore under-
manned squad. In addition’, Theo-
dore could well be in Bowen’s
boat. Joe Scisly did such an eye
catching job against Nebraska as
Jim's replacement that he too
may-have earned an opening as-
signment.

incurred” no additional patients
for Trainer Howard Waite. This
may prove to be a good omen.

Coach Michelosen is cautious
about Saturday’s engagement
with the Little Soldiers. When
queried about the severity of
the Army test, he replied that
“There are six tough games left
on our schedule.” He would not
venture an ' opinion about the
merits of the New Yorkers as
against some other of the re-
maining opponents.

The Nebraska team has also fac-
ed the Cadets. They lost by the
count of 42-0 on September 28.
The Cornhuskers’ coach Bill Jen-
nings was reticent about making
any comparisons between the
two teams. Jennings did say, “I
think the game will resolve it-
self to a battle of the two lines.”

Heavy Fan Support
Husker players were not .as
guarded as their coach, however.
Fullback Jerry Brown conceded
that there was not much to pick

‘from between the opposing lines.

The backﬁelds are another matter,
according to the burly Brown. “I
believe" that Pitt has a backﬁeld
edge,” stated Brown after his
team’s 34-O pasting. “Your backs
are more deceptive and they do a
better‘job of blocking.”

The truth in Brown's conten-
tion may be weighed after the
Saturday tussle. The Panthers
will have a rooting section of
approximately 3,000 fans. This
was the allotment which the
Pitt athletic oﬂiée sold out rath-
er quickly. In addition, the Stu-
dent Congress busses will pro-
vide official student representa-
tion. - _

The Nebraska waltz provided
some interesting afterthoughts.
The offensive line paved the path
for the ﬁve touchdowns which
was the greatest number any
Michelosen team has scored in the
three years of his tutelage.

Fred Riddle reigns as the four
game leading ground gainer with
214 yards in 34 carries. Stark,

—Scisly, and Dick Haley follow
‘Riddle in the rushing department.

Army Contest  
Battle Of East

BY MURRAY CHASS

,_ ‘After last Saturday’s friend-
ly little engagement with No-
tre Dame, the Army Cadets
may decide to take no chances
against the Panthers this
Week and move all their mil-

itary arms from the arsenals and
the maneuver sites to Michie
Stadium. _

For any one, including Coach
Earl Blaik, knows these arms
will be’ needed as reinforce-
ments behind the Cadet ﬁrst team.

‘The way the Army squad has

shaped up thus far it appears
that its whole strength is placed
in the hands of the ﬁrst eleven
men. A‘

This, the post—game quarter-
backs say, was the real reason
why the Black Knights were up-
set by the Irish. If the West
Pointers have the same lack of
ready and able battlers this Sat-
urday, they‘ may again be upset.

Army Surprise Team

It would have to be considered
a surprise reversal because Army
-has been awarded the role of fav-
orite by a couple of points. But
then, too, the Cadets were in the
same featured role against the
Dame. .
The Black Knights have been
a surprise themselves so far this
season. Selected to be no better
than number four in the East,
they have already downed in
convincing manner the Penn
Sate Lions, who were given top
billing in this part of the coun-
try prior to the ﬁrst kick-off.

In the opener Army shellacked

those poor Nebraska Cornhuskers,

42-0. This, of course, was eight
more points than the Panthers
tallied against the hapless Husk-
ers. But when scores reach that
high on the number scale, one or
two more touchdowns have little
signiﬁcance.

Kernan At Center

Coach Blaik, who is becoming
as much an institution at the
Point as Kissing Rock, has had a
nucleus of only twelve returning
lettermen to use so far. Of these
twelve, four were starters last
year.

Captain Jim Kernan will be
at center for the secondiyear
but can hardly compare to the
locals’ ‘Ch-arley Brueckman, an
All-American candidate (by
Beano Cook). Kernan‘ is rather
light for a. pivot man at 190
pounds.

Stan Slater, the strong man of
Army’s line last year, is once
again backto harrass oppossing
backs. The 188‘-pound guard is
considered one of the top play-

Harriers Continue
Winning Streak;
Timon, Rush Star

The undefeated Harriers con’-,,
tinued their winning streak with

a 24-34 win over Ohio University
on the four and three—tenth mile
course at Schenley Park last Sat-
urday.

Wally Gunther of the Ohio U.
crossed the tape ﬁrst with the
time of 22 minutes, and 48 seconds.
Panther star, Vince Timon, strode
home next followed by his two
team mates Ron Rush and George
Walter. '

Qhio University’s Tom Zola
and Bob Redman trailed the
Panther men. Blue and Gold’s
Ron Goldstein, Tom Wojnar
and John Griciotti rounded out
the Pitt scoring. ,

Coach Olson is still hunting a
man to ﬁnish with his top three
men of Timon, Rush, and Walters.
As Coach Olson says, “If I can

ﬁnd a fourth runner, ‘we will have

a ‘strong team.’.’

The other two returning start-

his ill—called and ill-fated pass in
the closing minutes of the Notre

Barta ran wild against Penn

Saturday on an 81-yard romp and
a one-yard sweep.

Freshman Grid Opelier
May Be Cancelled-Flu ,,,-

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Coach Steve Petro’s freshman gridders have proven that
you shouldn’t count your chickens before they hatch. This

"year’s group of freshman stars were supposedly the biggest

and most talented’ group ever assembled at Pitt.

When the squad reported

for their initial practiceiat

Trees Field,’they made reporters’ eyes pop, and everyone

present wondered where Pitt gotO
their future stars.

However the Asian ﬂu and
many serious injuries have crip-
p 1 e d t h e V
yearlings to
t h e extent
that C o a c h
P e t r 0 may
have the ﬁrst

Panthers have

son. West Virginia visits Ells-

Away games are with Penn
State on October 19, Navy is

the boys will remain over night.

Petro stressed. the need for ‘
more linenlen. .“I'might have to

cancel the ﬁrst game at Penn
State on Saturday morning if
the present shortage‘ of guards
and tackles doesn’t improve,”
commented Petro.

The last scrimmage showed the
following gridders to be composu
ing the ._ﬁrst eleven. Mike Ditka
and Ron Delﬁne at end, Len
Vella ‘ and Elmer Merkovsky
tackles, the guards are Chuck
Leith and 'Paul Hodge, and Rich
Matyus is holding down the center
position. ‘ V ’

The backﬁeld is considered iby
every yogi in’ Pittsburgh to be
loaded. John Sakal of Aliquippa
High is at quarterback, two Mt.
Lebanon graduates, Bobby Laftue
and Charles Reinhold, hold down
the halfback slots, while the full-
back is Jim Cunningham. ‘

Assistant coach Bob Pollock
states that Ditka and »Merkovéky-
in the line, and Sakal, LaRue, and

Cunningham in the backﬁeld have

been the standouts in practice; 130

are sporting a 3-0 record.
Ed Boyle, All-American c

andidate will lead the Rockets.

He has an outstanding-shot to score from his center—forward
position. Ed Jarvi is the other man that the Panthers have

to watch.

Last Saturday the Rockets de-
feated Oberlin 3-1. This was only
the second loss in ﬁve years for
Oberlin. Slippery Rock will pre-
sent a strong defensive club about
the same depth as the Panthers.

Bemis Lauds Team

Slippery Rock will have the
incentive that all small
schools have when meeting a
large school, and that is to beat
the large school.

Coach Bemis commenting on
last Saturday’s game with Lock
Haven mentioned, “We looked
much better than at any time
before.” The Blue and Gold also
passedmuch better and work-
ed the ball closer before shoot-.
ing.

Sam Hazou banged home two
goals and Jerry Bressanelli scored
the other one. Les Fogleman scor-
ed on a mix-up in front of goalie
Ron Goga.

No Injuries
The scoring was so well dis-
tributed it brought a smile to
Coach Bemis’s face. Bressanelli,
Hazou and Simeon Pestich have

scored two goals each. Lee Good-0

man and Jason Shrinsky have
scored one each so far this sea-
son.

None of the Booters were seri-
ously injured and are expected
to be in top shape for Satur-
day's encounter. Pete Karavellis
had a slight leg injury but
hopes to be able to play._

Coach Bemis is hoping that the
flu doesn’t hold any of the play-
ers out of this next tilt with the
Rockets.

Defensive Units Star

Ron Podmilsek, who reecntly
moved into the starting line, was

lauded by the head mentor, for his‘

fine defensive play. The play of
Bob Long and Tom Young at
halfback also caught the eye of
the coach.

Jim Graham at outside left is ‘

playing a steady game on the
starting line of Hazou, Jack
Horox, Karavellis, and Chuck
Kane.

Coach Bemis is very happy with
his pass defense. He attributes
this to moving Bressanelli from
the line to a halfback slot to help

stop passes by the offense. Fine
fullbacking by Bill Eisinger and
Fred Kipp along with soph Pod-
milsek has also helped.

Giving the sophomores a chance
to play has also helped Coach
Bemis develop a strong team this
year and will help develop teams
for the future.

On Oct. 26 the Blue and
Gold will host the Ohio State
Buckeyes, one of the top teams
in the Big Ten. Last year the
Buckeyes had the best crop‘ of
freshmen soccer players they have
ever had in the history of that
school.

Booters Tackle RocketslS'wamis Sail With Whitewater
In Early Morning Tilt

By JIM LACEY
On Saturday the undefeated Panther Booters meet the
Slippery Rock Rockets at 10 a.m. in the Stadium. The Rockets

long ago at the Stadium, but Su-
perintendent “Horse” Czarnecki,
reports that there is now no sign
of the suspected bookie in the Oak-
land vicinity.

Bookie, or no, the bafﬂement of
the “seers was quite evident last
week. The Miami Hurricane has
been reduced to a gentle zephyr
and so the Tarheels of North Car-
olina can breee through with little
tailwind. Perhaps, the N.C. Staters
have gotten-the secret from their
brethren and can also push aside
th: Biscayne Breeze.

The‘ Bayou Swizzlers from
L.S.U. mauled Georgia Tech to
confound the Confounded Quintet.
They thus earned a return trip to
the chart. Bowden Wyatt’s Razer-
backs upset Baylor and were dis-
courteous in their report to the
local oﬂice, so they will not dark!

College students usually
settle down in their old
neighborhoods after graduation.

D TRUI

False. Statistically, there’s only a 50-
50 chance that you will return to your
home area. If you left your home
State to go to school, the odds are'2
p out of 3 that you will settle Clown in a
different State after you get your
degree. _ -
