Students Prepare
History Of ‘News’

Staff Members Also Will Trace
Other Publications’ Origins

A component part of the history of
the University which is being com-
piled by. Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, as-
sistant professor of English, will be a.
history of the University publications.
Helen Rose. Gibson, C36, and Charles
A. Ruch, C36, are at work tracing the
lineage of The Pitt News, Panther,
Ow1_ Journeyman, Compass, Alumni
Review, Pittsburgh Record and Dental
Rays.

The origins of the News are already
rather well known. The campus news-
paper took its ﬁrst form as the Uni-
versity Courant at the Vvestern Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and became
the Pitt Vveekly in 1908 when the
University moved to its present site.
In 1932 the Weekly became The Pitt
News, and was published semi—weekly.
Last year the policy of tri—weekly pub
lication was adopted. 1

The history which will include trac-
ing the family trees of all other Uni-
versity publications, will be com
pleted in January, said Ruch and Miss
Gibson. ‘

Mrs. Starrett announces that the
work on the history is progressing
rapidly. She wishes to express her
appreciation to those students who
have offered documents pertinent to
the history for her use. Material
such as old catalogs and bulletins,
diplomas; pictures, diaries, and the
like is requested. and may be left in
Mrs. Starrett’s office, Room 108, State
Hall. .

Glee Club‘ Initiates

Approximately 45. pledges will be

will be led by student members of
the seminar, one will have an outside
speaker, and another will have a lec-
ture illustrated by motion pictures.

The combined mechanical and
aeronautical seminar in Room 817,
Cathedral, will feature the motion pic-
tures. These will illustrate a talk by
Dr. Aston, who is continuing his lec-
ture of last week on the methods of
pipe manufacture.

The industrial seminar to be held
in Room 12:08, Cathedral, will be led
by four of the students. They will

Hazy .Notion Abroad _
That Hop Didn’t Lose

Any sort of ﬁnancial report.,
even a. very rough, incomplete
one, for Friday night's formal
Soph Hop won't beavailable
for a. few days. It is. thought.
however, that the affair did not
suffer a loss.

Somewhere between 200 and
225 couples attended the dance
at the beautiful Twentieth Cen-
tury Club ballroom. Archie
Bleyer’s network orchestra
played from 9 to 1 o’clock.

Alvan Foraker, i\Ied39, James
Earhart, BA35, and Alfred Pero,
Ed37, ﬁlled in as ﬁrst trumpet
and t.rombonists with the band
in one specialty number. Three
members of the University
quartet, Robert Euwer. C36,
Frank Engel, B.-‘I38, a11d Eugene
Burkhart, C36, sang Alma
Mater, and Burkhart then gave
a solo of “I’m in the Mood for
Love.” .

D. C. Schultz, BA, was chair-
man of the dance. Julian Rus-
lander, BA, was business man-
ager.

 

Pardon Me, Boys,

I'm The Governor

Was his face red?

One of life’s little tragedies
struck Alexander Leggin, C37, in a
hallway on the seventeenth floor of
the _William Penn Hotel while
cadets. and girls‘ danced merrily on
in the ballrooms Saturday night.j

Leggin, of the University ROTC,
was stationed with several other

uniformcd students to guard the
door leading up from the sixteenth

floor. Orders given the guardians
were: Let no one in through the
door. 

Quite late in the evening there.
was another push on the door and
a_nother'time Leggin repeated his in-
structions. This fellow. was as in-
sistent as all the others, finally ask-
ing, “Can’t the governor of this state
come through this‘door?” , '

“You cotlld,” replied L'eg'gin,'-who
was used to this, “if you happened
to be the governor.” -

The “crasher” recovered himself
in time to keep from falling. back
down the steps and ‘silently offered
credentials.

The November issue of the Pitt
Panther appears next W'ednesday~
with “more .newcomers than ever
before,” as Editor Russ Connolly,
C36, putsit. -

Heading the list is Israel Gold-
berg, manager of the debating team,
who recounts some episodes of the
debating team’s travels. If Gold-
berg’s anecdotes are anythinglike
the postal cards he sent home ‘dur-
ing his debating tour through the
South last year—whee!

Quill Club Sets Friday

For Journeyman Deadline

Quill Club, honorary literary frater-
nity, met last night at the YMCA hut.

Several students who are interested
in contributing to the Journeyman,
literary publication of the University,
attended the meeting as guests. Alan"
C. Lloyd, Ed36, a.nd Jane Brahm, C37,
read selections they had written, at
the meeting.

Deadline for contributions to the
Journeyman has been announced for
Friday noon. Manuscripts may be
turned into Mary Milburn, dean of‘
men’s office, Room 801, Cathedral.

Player-Writer

Everyone who turned to The Pitt
News sport page Friday probably
read the story from West Point under
the by-line “Bud Underwood.” Proba-
bly no one ﬁgured that it was this
same Underwood who started the
game at quarterback for the Army
Saturday. Reports are that the cadet
does well in his double role, except
for some occasions when he unconsci-
ously explains the team’s plays!

Fou_rth,hour classes will be ex-
cused and students will have an op-
portunity to hear a recital of Indian
songs, dances, and legends at a gen-
eral assembly Friday in Memorial
Hall.

Te Ata., Choctaw Indian princess,
who appeared two years ago before
the women students at Leaders’ In-
stitute, will present the program, as-
sisted by a Pawnee Indian boy,
Kuruks Pahetu.

Princess Te Ata. whose name
means “Bearer of the Morning,” has
presented her program on the pro-
fessional stage .both in this country
a.nd abroad, and has won the admira-
tion and appreciation of countless
auditors, Indian and paleface alike.
iWhat_is perha'=ps even more unusual,

have permitted thunderous applause

here from his native Oklahoma, to
assist Te Ata in the assembly pro-
gram. He was a protege of Madame
Sembrich, and studied voice at Juil-
liard’s studio i11 New York City. He
has done radio work, presenting the
old Indian songs. His grandfatlier
was a well known Pawnee chief, and
his father, who is still living, has
much to do with the affairs of the
tribe.

will be a panel discussion on war
andpeace, with prominent graduate
students and .undergraduates com-
prising the panel of speakers.

Although the theme of the meeting
has been designated as “We who are
about to be shot at,” the discussion
will probably include a «consideration
of such topics a.s militant paciﬁsm,
the world ﬁght for peace and the dan-
gers of militaristic propaganda.

Dr. W. M. Parrish, professor of pub-
lic . speaking, will preside at the
session. _ 4

Pi Tau Phi what he thought of the
International Art Exhibit at the
sch.olast_ic,:g hoi1o1*a‘r';:’_s“g_wr§r1.e;et“i‘p’ig“A

Mr. \Varner, whose work. “Black
Twins,” is on display, criticized the
show as insufficiently representative.
He praised such artists as Dali and
Blume. and called Central European
art “uninteresting and unimportant
this year.”

"‘Alft somehow does not ﬂourish
-under dictatorships,” the speaker
replied when questioned regarding
the German display.

“There is much justiﬁcation for
awarding ﬁrst. prize to Spain,” he
added. “During the past few years
Spain has tinned out consistently
good work. ‘Elvira and Tiberio’
may not be a world-beater, but it
is a good, craftsmanlike picture.”

Faculty Members To Speak

Dr. S. P. Franklin, professor of re-

principal of the Falk Elementary

tions at Thiel College, Greenville, be-
ginning today.

Dr. Franklin will speak on “The Re-

‘Show-Oi Cast, Set For Opening

Tomorrow N ighi, G

Cass Declares i‘All’s Well’;
‘Players S av ‘Ditto,
Are We Good.”

“I think that .‘The Show-Off’ will
be the best modern entertainment that
we have given, and I hope that the
student body will take advantage of
what we of Pitt Players consider an
exceptional opportunity.”

So speaks Carl B. Cass, faculty di-
rector of Players, and he’s talking
about the show tomorrow night at 8
o'clock in the YM-YTVHA auditorium
on Belleﬁeld Avenue.

John “Football Hero" Parks, BA36,
expressing regrets that it soon. will
be all over, says: “ ‘Sic transit
gloria mundi,’ and we never get used
to it.” Parks plays the role of
Aubrey, the liar, braggart, and egotist
who ﬁnally vindicates himself.

Carolyn Hall,- Ed36, who has been
making war on a pernicious cold with
nose a11d cough drops, confesses:

; “There’s nothing I get more thrill out

of than being in a show. Footlights
. make-up . . . costumes . . . a
dark auditorium. It certainly ‘gets’
me. The cast and director of ‘The
Show-Off’ have been grand to work
with.” Miss Hall is playing the part
of Mrs. Fisher, irascible mother-in-law
of Aubrey, who is the _bane of her life.
Audrey Graham, C37, former girl
scout, says: “Swell play, swell, swell

7

director, and swell bunch of play-
mates”. lvliss Graham tomorrow
night will be Clara, the neglected wife
of Frank Hyland, played by Jolln
Vveisbrod, C39.

Vveisbrod comments: “I like this
racket. I’ve been_ doing this play and
another with thelvlasquers simulta-
neously. I try‘ to study, too.”

Beverly Childress, C38, sweet and
simple Amy in the play, has had a
great deal of fun, “particularly the
night eight of the cast and Mr. Cass
drove over to Audrey Graham's house
in Mt. Lebanon, after rehearsal, and
gu7.z"led cider.” _

Robert Madden, C37, who takes the
role of Joe, brother of Amy and Clara,
likes play-acting as well as tennis.
“J-ust say I think the whole thing is
going to be the nert.s,” he said when
interrupted at a furious ping-pong
game in the Y Hut.

Richard Frankel, C39, and grumpy
Mr. Fisher in the play, says: “Nobody
has said anything y-etabout the pic-
tures that Luke Swank took. I think
they were ﬁne, so hats off to Luke! !"

Chalmers Brown, Ed37, extols John
“Football Hero” Parks: ‘He makes
Victor "Moore in ‘Anything Goes’ look
like an amateur comedian, and I have
a right to say this, since I have seen
‘Anything Goes.’ ”. Brown is taking
the role of Gill, a working man.

Raymond Maclntyre, C38, is Mr.
Rpogers, an insurance salesman in the
play. He admires, among other
things about Director Cass, the gor-

V Receipt of full-size drawings for

ﬁve years international work on this

In those ﬁve years much patient
and painstaking work had to be done
to make the Hungarian room ﬁt the

fall within the bounds of classroom

in its decorative treatment, and third,
it must be utilitarian.

This last feature, utility, is em-
phasized because the University
doesn't want the Nationality Rooms
to become museum pieces. They are
primarily for student and classroom
use. The concept of these rooms is
to bring a feeling, a spiritual glow, as
it were, to those who enter them. This
feeling is, of course, to be carried into
their studies and a better understand-
ing of the cosmopolitan life of Pitts-
burgh.

Up in Room 1309, Cathedral, in the
Nationality Room Studios, 15 commit-
tees representing different countries
work throughout the year toward the
goal of a completed, ﬁnancially any-
way. nationality room.

Through this office letters and
plans are exchanged in 15 different
languages. The committees have as
their aide, Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, who is the University repre-
sentative for the groups.

The Nationality Rooms when com-
pleted will be the outstanding, if not
the only, classrooms of their type in
the world. They mark a unique ad-
vance in classroom construction.

Engineers Finn
To Bridge Gap
In Social Events

By Sam Williams

The engineers have hit upon a
scheme to bridge the social gap in
the University calendar. The bridge
construction work will begin Friday
evening at nine o’clock. The site for
the breaking of the ground which will
open this engineering enterprise is
the Grotto, and the man behind the
silver-plated pick will be Edward
Shepherd, IE36, who is the chief en-
gineer of the job.

Baron Elliott will be present as en-
gineer - in - charge - of-the-rhythm ma-
chine. He promises that the machine
will operate at top R.P.M. from nine
until one.

Civil Engineer William Hall, E36,
No. 1 of the Engineering Association,
has just ﬁnished ﬁguring whether the
Grotto will stand the static vibrations
resulting from the approval that will
issue from the throats of the 400 or so
couples attending the groundbreaking
ceremony.

t“A"ccording to -the calculations of
my corps,” he said, “the roof has a
safety factor of ﬁve. This is a great
disappointment, but with a little extra
effort it may be possible to raise the
roof anyhow.”

Dancing, which is technically called

“Trucking” (railroad engineers’ theme
song), will cost one dollar. Although
tickets can not be secured at the door,
they may be purchased from any of
the following: James Shields, IE37;
William McQuade, CE37; Frank
Obenauf, E37; Phillip Kurtz, ME37;
Robert Millar, iAE37;' Florian Maj-
chrzak, ChE37; Nelson Messinger,
EE37; Robert Smith, AE36; Elmer
Messer, E36; Frank Hockensmith,

Watch Your Husks, Nebraska,
Panthers Are Clicking Again

 

Pitt Eleven, Cornhuskers Renew Grid Rivalry, Saturday;
Local Fans To Get First Peek At Cardwell

 

Out around Lincoln, Nebraska, they are issuing storm warnings
to the Nebraska football team that Pittsburgh’s. Panthers will be in
a very turbulent mood next Saturday when the Cornhuskers come
here for their annual contest with Pitt.

The main reason for the Panthers’ frame of mind can be traced
to an ideal Saturday afternoon just four days ago when Army was
Pitt ’s guest at the Stadium, and received a severe dose of November
hospitality from the Blue and Gold eleven.

Up to last Saturday Coach Suther-v%

land’s outﬁt had played in-and-out
football, clicking like a typical Pan-
therfootball machine at one moment,
and playing indifferently at other
times. But against the Cadets, the
Jungle Cats seem to have ignited the
spark necessary to start their machine
moving, and next Saturday's game
will tell whether or not it is still on
the move.

Headed by the outstanding sopho-
more back of last season, one Lloyd
Cardwell, the Cornhuskers will bring
to Pittsburgh another potentially great
eleven. Last Saturday Coach Dana X.
Bible’s outﬁt won the Big Six confer-
ence title for the sixthtime. in eight
gridiron seasons . . by _- beating _ Kansas
19-13. ‘

In seven encounters this season,
the Cornhuskers have won ﬁve, lost
one, and tied one. Minnesota's great
team handed them their only setback
by a 12-7 score. In that particular
game the Nebraska team outplayed
the Gophers, but could not get over
a second score and therein lies the
story. The following week, still suf-
fering from the eﬂfects of that defeat,
the Cornhuskers were played to a
scoreless tie by a ﬁghting Kansas
State team.

Since then, however, Coach Bible’s
outﬁt has come along in ﬁrst rate
fashion, bowling over an undefeated
Oklahoma team, 19-0, beating a strong.
Missouri eleven, 19-6, and clinching
the Big Six toga by defeating Kansas.
Early season victories were scored
over Chicago and Iowa State.

Nebraska Has Veteran Team

Thirteen lettermen returned to the
squad this season, including last sea-
son’s varsity backﬁeld of Bauer, Card-
well, Lanoue, and Francis. The big-
gest gap in the team that Coach Bible
had to ﬁll this season was at center
where Franklin Meier formerly held
sway-. However Bob Mehring, . a
sophomore, and Paul Morrison, letter-
man from the 1929 team, came along
to erase that worry from Coach Bible’s
mind.

At ends Bernie Scherer, one of the
leading defensive players in the mid-
west, and Lester McDonald, junior
letterman, have been holding down
varsity posts. Both men stand well
over the six foot mark and make ex-
cellent targetsfor forward passes.’

Jimmy Heldt and Fred Shirey, a
pair of 200-pounders and six-footers,
have been playing tackles on the var-
sity. Shirey, a sophomore, is from
Latrobe.

Coach Bible’s center trio is made
up of Johnny Williams, Ladas_Hubka
or Kenny McG~innis, and Paul Morri-
son or Bob Mehring. Williams, a
senior, is a great all-around player,
having played every position in the
backﬁeld as well as center and guard
on the line. This season he has been
used at guard.

In the backﬁeld Henry “Chief”
Bauer calls the signals and -tosses the

passes. Johnny Howell, a sophomore,
and Allen Turner, a reserve, are
Bauer’s assistants. Cardwell and

Lanoue answer the dream of every
coach for a pair of nifty halfbacks.
Cardwell, a six foot, three inch lad
packing 190 pounds, has contributed
numerous long runs from scrimmage
this season, and sparkled against the
Panthers at Lincoln last fall. Bob
Benson and Ralph Eldridge, a pair of
senior lettermen, have been doing re-
serve duty.

At fullback Sam Francis handles
the line plunging and punting duties.
Francis is another six foot, 200 pound
player. For second team duty, Donald
Douglas, junior letterman, gets the
call.

Watching Pitt Foes

The Huskers of Nebraska clinched
the honors in the Big Six conference
by trimming Kansas State, 19-13, in
a wild ball game.

Carnegie Tech found Holy Cross
too much of a burden and went down
to defeat at Worchester, 7-0. The
Crusaders scored the only points of
the game early in the opening quar-
ter.

Southern California's Trojan horse
got a kick in the ribs from Monk
Moscrip, Stanford’s All-American end,
who booted a ﬁeld goal in the last
minute of play to give the Cardinals a
3-0 victory over USC.

Army Team Bows
To Panthers, 29-6

Last Period Attack Routs Cadets;
LaRue, Patrick, Randour Star

If Sherman's march to the I seas
back in Civil War days was as unin-
terrupted and spectacular as the
Panthers’ drives to the Army goal
line last Saturday, it must have been
a greatsight. For the Panthersgave
68,000 fans who jammed the Stadium
one of the greatest gridiron shows that
has ever been staged on a local bat-
tle-ﬁeld, sending the West Pointers
back to the drill ﬁelds with a 29-6 set-
back.

After getting as far as the Army
11-yard line early in the ﬁrst quarter
only to lose the ball on a fumble, the
Blue and Gold eleven returned the
pigskin to the enemy’s 24-yard line,
from which point Frank Patrick

booted his fourth ﬁeld goal of the

current season, to give=the~'Panthers
a three-point margin at half time.
Coach Gar Davidson sent his back-
ﬁeld ace, Monk Meyer, into the fray
as the second half got under way, and
the versatile" Monk personally led a
sortie into Panther territory. After
forcing the Cadets to punt, the locals
began a long-to-be-remembered march
to the Army goal line. Starting from
their 18-yard line, the Panthers, with
Randour and Patrick doing most of
the ball carrying, arrived at the Army
8-yard line in very short order. At
this point the Army boys entrenched
themselves for a couple of plays, but
a perfectly executed lateral pass from

Patrick to LaRue sent the latter over

‘for the Pitt touchdown. Patrick
kicked the extra point and the parade
was on its way.

Army Scores

Following this turn of events, the
Vfest Pointers in true military fashion
launched a counter-attack of 65 yards
for their lone six-pointer. A pass
from Meyer to True gave the soldiers

the” score.

Coach Sutherland sent his regulars
back to the front, and they proceeded
to move down the ﬁeld with the pre-
cision that the cadet corps showed
when they marched up the ﬁeld "in
pre-game manuevers. Bobby LaRue
broke loose on a deceptive reverse
play and raced 75 yards for another
score.

About a minute later, Randour got
hold of an Army forward pass, car-
rying it to the Cadet 27. Patrick and
LaRue collaborated once mor_e on a
lateral pass for the third score, but
ofﬁcials found fault with the way it
was executed. The same pair tried
again and it worked the second time,
with LaRue adding his third touch-
down to the Panther score.

With reserves ﬁlling the posts for
the Pitt team, a pass from VVood to
Shaw completed the scoring activities
for the afternoon. Urban threw the
pass from about midﬁeld to Shaw who
took it on the Army one-yard stripe
and stepped over the goal line for the
ﬁnal boom from the scoring guns of
Pittsburgh.—H. E. R.

Defeat W. Va.
F rash Team,I8-0

The Little Panthers as well as the
big Panthers had a successful week-
end. Playing before a large Armis-
tice Day crowd of 5,000 at Connells-
ville, Pa., Coach Mike Mi1ligan’s year-
lings whitewashed the West Virginia
Freshman eleven, 18-0.

The Pitt fresh scored six-pointers
in every quarter but the. third; .In
the initial period, Stebbins went over
for the score, after the yearlings had
marched the opening kick-oﬁ down
the ﬁeld.

Raskowski, Pitt guard, blocked a
kick in the second period to give his
team the ball deep in Mountaineer
territory. A few plays later, a pass to
Daddlo from Goldberg gave the Little
Panthers their second score.

In the ﬁnal period, Cambal, frosh
fullback, broke loose on a reverse

play and ran 48 yards for the touch-
down. ‘

Advance In Greek
Football League

Joining Delta Tau Delta in the
semi-ﬁnal bracket of the Interfrater-
nity touch football tourney, Phi Epsi-

lon Pi and Phi Delta Theta are mak-
ing a strong bid for the Greek title.

Sol Menaker played the leading role
in "the triumph over SAM, ﬁguring in
every score. Racing back a punt on
‘the second play of "the game, he went
over the goal line for the ﬁrst touch-
down. His short ﬂing to Jack Kotler
accounted for the extra point.

In the second quarter Menaker
dropped back to the 21-yard line and
sent a dropkick squarely between the
uprights for a ﬁeld goal. A 30-yard
heave to Marks sent the Wolves into
the half intermission with a 16-0 lead.

Capitalizing on a Phi Ep fumble,
the Sammies chalked up their six
points on a pass from Pinsky to
Seigal, only after three line bucks
fro'm"the one-yard marker had failed.

Scoring was completed in the ﬁnal
period when Menaker tossed a 17-
yard pass to Kotler for a touchdown.
Sending the pigskin through the goal-
posts on his second dropkick, Menaker
added the extra point.

Phi Delta Theta. entered the semi-
ﬁnals by trouncing Sigma Chi, 12-0.
Bill Grosscope passed to Sam Ander-
son and Neff Wells for the scores.

Panther Harriers Dominate
Field In Junior Al)/IA Event

Barney Gedwilas Cracks Tape In 22 Minutes, 43 Seconds;
Pitt Varsity Cops Team Title With 21 Points

Watch Barney Gedwilas of VVest Virginia University in the
IC4A meet at New York City, Monday!

It was the same Gedwilas of

two years ago who flashed the

master ’s touch as he polished oil’ Red Tost in the Junior AMA cham-
pionships, Monday, much in the same manner he displayed at Mor-
gantown when they ﬁrst clashed as freshmen.

The Panthers for the fourth straight year ran away with the

team title, copping the ﬁrst three
team places. Tost in second place,
Cook in fourth, Leggin in ﬁfth, and -
Emens and Groat rounding out the
varsity score in seventh and eighth,
respectively, copped the AMA title
with a low total of 21 points. In the
te_am scoring only members of full
teams ﬁgure in the tabulations.

Johnny Woodruff, freshman ace,
placed high, taking sixth to lead the
freshman squad to the runner-up po-
sition with a total of 60 points. The
Pitt Jayvees made itacomplete Olson
Day by taking third place with an
83-point total. Carnegie Tech’s var-
sity ran fourth with 84 points and
Bethany varsity hill-and-dalers ﬁnish-
ed ﬁfth with 93 markers.

Forty-two runners in the starting
line-up ﬁnished the short four-mile
lake course over Schenley park. Col-
legiate representatives dominated the
ﬁeld, with Mazey placing ﬁrst among
the unattached entries in 20th posi-
tion. Randall, another veteran dis-
tance runner, was back in 24th place.

After crossing the rim of Flagstaff
hill, Gedwilas immediately stepped
out to set the pace.’ Slowly, he pulled
away from Tost and the rest of the
ﬁeld as he rounded the lake in Pan-
ther Hollow and began the ascent to
the merry-go—around. As he crossed
the stone bridge on the cinder path
midway to the top, heworked smooth-
ly to increase his lead to 300 yards.

From the sharp left turn on the
level green at the top, Barney looked
like a certain winner with a lead of
better than a quartermile. The short
climb to the golf course, and the re-
maining downhill descent on the fair-

cracked the tape in 22:43 minutes.
This mark bettered last year's mark
of 24:27.6 minutes, hung up by Giolma
of Carnegie Tech, by virtually two
minutes. The course this year, how-
ever, was shortened by‘ almost 200
yards according to James Potts, as-
sistant track coach.

Pinkerton of Tech gave Tost a.
merry chase during the ﬁrst three
miles, ﬁnishing a good third some 13
seconds behind Tost’s 23:33 mark.
Cook of Pitt copped fourth in 24:17
minutes. Alex Leggin, Pitt varsity
placed next in 24:36. .

Woodruff, Pitt frosh, Emens and
Groat, Pitt varsity, Zamborsky, Pitt
frosh, and Theriault, Pitt varsity,
rounded out the first ten to give Pan-
ther harriers eight positions in the
select group.

Others to ﬁnish were: Brown, Beth-
any, 11th; Follette, Pitt jayvees, 12th,;
Horner, Bethany-, 13th; Cogswell, Pitt;
frosh, 14th; Connelly, Pitt jayvees,
15th; Lyngheim, Tech, 16; Walmsley,

Beaux Arts Ends
Freshman Events

Debating, Choral Groups Invite
Women To Bohemian Salon

Freshman women and their senior
mentors will turn Bohemian for a
while when members of the Women’s
Choral and the ‘Women’s Debating As-
sociation entertain them next Wed-~
nesday at the Beaux Arts Salon,
established as a Heinz House tradi-
tion last year.

Attired in artist's smocks and
hostess pajamas, the Choral and De-
bating representatives will lead their
guests about a chairless Heinz House
whose black-draped walls display pic-
tures lent by the Fine Arts Depart-
ment. Afterwa.rds, using cushions
supplied chieﬂy by the freshmen,Vthe
women will scatter themselves about
on the floor. to listen to and look at
a program which will include music
by the Choral, dance interpretations,
story-telling, and an informal lecture
by a member of the Fine Arts faculty.

.Art will be forsaken at some time
during the evening for a consideration
of- sandwiches and coffee.

Thus far this semester freshman
women have, at various times, walked
up University steps, clad in white
dresses with lanterns in their hands:
have fashioned strange headgear for
the Coed Prom; have lighted Heinz
House ﬁre in the Hearth Ceremony;
and- donned their best evening dress

-for the formal _Panhellenic Reception.

For Beaux Arts, which concludes the
series of upperclass welcomes to
them. freshman women will be allowed
to wear just anything they please.

Tales For The Grandchildren;
Or, She Danced With A Cadet

The tall plebe cadet from Texas
gave the ﬁnal hop to a West Point
mazurka, wipe-d his forehead, with the
back of a White glove, and remarked
emphatically to the little blonde in
blue, “It certainly is a rousin’ night,
maiam-39

And the blonde in blue, the 800, ca-
dets, the girl friends, and the 1100-
University hostesses—100 attending
the Military Ball last Saturday eve-
ning in the William Penn Hotel agreed
heartily. -

After getting over the novel sensa-
tion of coming to a formal dance in
the family car with Dad at 8:30
o'clock, the coed dancing partners pro-
ceded to have the time of their lives.
There wasn’t a Wallﬂower [in the
house. ROTC men appointed as hosts
introduced the hostesses to likely
looking cadets and a long and lively
stag line took care of the rest of the
evening.- There were touching scenes
when the ROTC boys introduced their
own girls to the gentlemen in uniform
and saw them dance away.

The cadets proved ﬁne_dancing part-
ners. To be sure, a few plebes who
certainly must have ﬂunked out in the
West Point dancing classes did their
home town carioca with not _a great
deal ‘of ﬁnesse, and a few of the short-
er girls had uncomfortable moments of
military buttons bumping their cheeks,
but that was forgotten in the excite-
ment of the rushing by the stag line
and the’ manners of the cadets.

Buttons _Are On Tight ,

The cadets seemed to enjoy the

Pittsburgh hospitality that had been

heaped upon them and realized mod- _

estly that they were the center of the
show and that_ they looked pretty good.
The full dress blue—gr_ay uniforms
were trim and handsome and the
shine of the gold buttons—44 by actu-
al count——gave a certain glitter to the
whole affair.

Some worried a little about how the
buttons on the back, of the coat _felt
when the cadet sat down, but the boys
managed well enough, The_ haircuts
of some of the gentlemen were mild-
ly astounding, putting to shame any
of the doormat cuts seen on the track
team, until it was explained that the
boys are clipped once a week, an av-
erage haircut being ﬁnished in a little
more than six minutes by the Corps
barbers.

Remembering legends of the last
Army ball concerning young ladies
who went home decorated with bell
buttons, a few of the coeds investi-
gated the situation and found that the
gold buttons this year are ﬁrmly
anchored on with iron washers. But
the coeds did not go home empty-
handed. In return for their hospital-
ity and hostessing, the 100 dancing
partners were presented with gold
mesh evening bags with the Army
insignia and a genuine bell button on
the chain.

The ball was colorful and gay. Shop
girls, debutantes, business men, and
even Mayor McNair crowded the hotel
lobby before and after» the dance to

watch the parade of cadets and girls
in evening dress. From the decorated
boxes surrounding the main ballroom,
Chancellor Bowman, prominent Army
officials, Governor Earle, and social
leaders, watched the dancing couples
below.

Came 12 o’clock,’and the announce-
ment for all cadets to leave immedi-
ately. ‘There was a scramble to the
check rooms, last good-byes, and for
the .next ‘half hour Grant street from
the hotel to the station was crowded
with cadets; alone, in groups, with
their girls, and in cars. And by 12:30
a group of young ladies was left with
memories of the evening, invitations
to visit West Point, addresses to write
to, and the same family car and Dad.

It was a big night. Newspaper writ-
ers have exhausted adjectives and
readers in describing the glamour of
Saturday night’s welcome to the Cadet
Corps of West Point and the young
ladies are still a bit dazed. But there
has yet ‘to be written the story of the
100 forgotten men who spent a Satur-
day evening at stag parties or at
home: silently thanking the fates that
the Army comes only once every four
years. ' ' -

News Gathering
Will Be Theme
At Xylon Forum

Today’s forum at 2:45 o’clock at
Heinz House opens a series of three
publicity forums sponsored by Xylon,
honorary journalistic fraternity for
women.

The subject under discussion this
afternoon will be the gathering of
news stories, and will be related to

Sochatoff, C36, Helen Rose Gibson,
C36, and Sarah Harris, C36, form the
remainder of the group. ’ ' '

All Women’s organizations have
been invited to send their publicity
chairmen to the forums, or if they
have no publicity chairman, to appoint
a delegate to represent them at the
meetings. This has been specially re-
quested so that each group will have
an opportunity to have its particular
problems dealt with. _

Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant dean
of women, and Mrs. Thomas E. Smith,
assistant director of -University pub-'
licity, will pour at the tea following
the open forums. ’.
