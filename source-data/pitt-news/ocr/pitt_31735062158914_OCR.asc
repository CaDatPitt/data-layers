Tl"cl-('lll"l‘it'lll8l"- acti\'it,v, at , the

l.'11i\'ersit_\".  was (l(,‘('.l(l.(‘Cl_
.\lon<‘ia_v'» inorningr when the

varsity stjuad '-'(lecli11e’(l an ex-
tension of the gridiron seasonby
voting against an administration
proposal ‘to participate in any,
post-season; game.

This ballot, taken at a meeting

the third hour Monday, crystal-
lized into official--,form a feel-
ing that h.as been prevalent
among the varsity squad members
for the past -few weeks.

The result of this action means
that the Panthers, accredited as:
the ranking team in the nation,
will not play in either the Rose
Bowl, the ‘Sugar Bowl, or any of
the other New Year’s Day foot-
ball attractions.

The meeting was called imme- ‘
diately upon the team’s return to
the campus, after the regularly-
scheduled season had been com-E
pleted Saturday when Duke was;
defeated at Durham, North Caro-
lina. 1
Players Acclaimed

Undefeated, and acclaimed by!
both grid experts and the foot-
ball public as one of the nation’s
foremost teams, t.he Panthers al-
ready had received invitations to
participate in the Sugar Bowl at
New Orlean and the Cotton Bowl
at Dallas, Texas. _

No invitation was forthcoming
from the Rose Bowl selectors.
However. definite assurance had
been given that the Panthers were
being considered prominently and
an indication of their reaction
was wanted. i

In this meeting, which the Uni-l
versity is xpected to translateg
into its official RSVP to anyone;
requesting its presence on the‘
gridiron January I, the traveling;
squad expressed its opinion on;
further football for the year.

The proposal was quashed for;
very simple reasons. The boys!
who do the playing on Pitt's foot- '
ball team were tired.

Twelve weeks of football, with
its obvious physical punishment is ;
a severe strain. Especially so in;
the case of the Panthers. A

Team's Decision 2

In meeting ten topflight op-5
ponents this year, Pitt was not,»
only meeting ten good football;
teams. It was meeting ten foot-’
ball teams who were keyed, ten
football teams whose season’s ob-
jective was to beat Pitt.

A post-season e n g a g ement 
would necessitate the resumption’,
of practice almost at once. The;
team wants rest,
from the gridiron strain that thisi
year has brought. And, they didi

ma ‘non ANGROS

‘Tomorrow sharply at 4 o’clock‘

on Trees Practice Field the Inter-
fraternity touch-football title goes
on the block to the highest scorer
with Delta Tau Delta and Lambda
Chi Alpha the only eligible bidders.
The Delts ﬁnd themselves in one
of the ‘two coveted positions for
the third time in four years. This
;year’s Lambda Chi entry is the

first to wade through to the top‘

for its house since the beginning of
‘Intram'..rrals.

Among G-reek circles Lambda
Chi has been getting top billing.
‘Odds of 3 to l are against the Delts.

Lambda Chi began their trek to 

the finals by tripping :1 fair Kappa
Sig outﬁi', 12-0, and permitting
only one first down. Its next vic-
tim, before it beat Phi Ep in the
semi-ﬁnals. 12-0, was Theta Chi.

The Delts drew a bye in the first

round and found the Pi Lams wa.it- 3

ing with an ugly glint in their
eyes.

Pi Lambda Phi, in fact, held 

Meet At Field.

 

the Delts even throughout a drab;

game except for two plays that
carried the ball from Delt terri-

tory across the goal line with cen— 5

ter Tredennick receiving‘ both;

passes. 3
STRONG OFFENSE

’In all i‘a_irness it must be said;

that the Delts. although they scored 
lucky fashion, presented 9. ~
mighty defense and stood Phi Delt T
off only j;a.rcls from the goal line:
several times before they v..'alked~

in

L1

off the field, victors, 6-0, in the
semi-ﬁnals.
Tomorrovr will see offense versus
defense. Lambda Chi sports the
best passer and array of receivers
to be found along Fraternity Row
this fall. In Mann and Tack they
"have two of the fastest and trickiest
backs in t«.‘>u-:-h—football. Mann has

time and again demonstrated his

abilities as a passer and receiver.

Johnny Downie and company;

will find Tack as elusive as quick-
silver and as easy to keep track of
"as a pack of rats in a cheese fac-
tory. He catches them on either
side, down the middle and crosses
with the ends. When he isn’t in
the open. 1‘./Iann himself invariably
ﬁnds Hebner or Stimple in the
clear.
DEFENSE TIGHT

On the other side of the ledger.
Delta Tau Delta has found little
difﬁculty in keeping its goal line
clear. Delts in their first game
held the Pi Lambs to one miserly
threatening gesture. And with
Phi Delt across the scrimmage line
it was almost the same story. No
Delt offense but plenty of defense
inside their own twenty-yard‘ line.

John Downie and “Tred” Tre-
dennick, are the Delts main-stays
in a tight territory that allows few
"passes to get by. Big Bill Berg and

‘ Schar shine in the line for the

Bayard Street boys.
Lambda Chi will, as mentioned
before‘, depend.-on Mann and Tack

in the secondary and Hebner andl

Stimple, crack ends, to provide a
margin of victory for them in their
quest for supremacy in the Inter-
frat touch-football ﬁnals.

Coach Jock Sutherland, in his
attempt to put his football team
in theproper mood for its ﬁnal
game with Duke, was given
material aid by a group. of
merchants and

the team Saturday, which Dr.

game. It was also tacked up
in the locker room. It was

Lambert Cup _ -
Awarded Pitt . "

.-U.-Undefeated Pitt was ‘recognized
as the outstanding football team
in the East yesterday when it was
awarded ‘the August V. Lambert
Meinorial Troptfy. for-- the second
successive year.

Selectedby aboard of 31 judges,
comprised of sports editors and

f6otb'all"“iXrf’ite"f‘§;'"tli'é"Panthers will‘ 

retain the handsome trophy as one
tangible indication of a season
well-played.’ S ‘

Pitt defeated Ohio Wesleyan,-...

State. and Duke and was tied by
Fordham during the season. Ford-

fildore Boxing
 Candidates

J:-rcl-: Shricker is still calling all
E boxing candidates.

, With boxing practice now in
ffull sv.'ing, there is ashortage in
ithe l25—pou:nd and the heavy-
:weight classes.

5 The only veteran .in. the 125-
%pound division, Homer Livingston,
Elias not as yet reported for prac-
,‘tice. There are several new pros-
Epects in thi group, but not hail’

%the l1l_?,!l‘;lJ(~_‘l"lZl‘.ai should really bel

 out.
Coach Shricker is trying to vvork

in few oi.‘ the l35—pounders down '

to the 125-pound limit, but this is
an uncertain process.
HE.-XVIES REPORT

, If you are a few pounds over
-the 1.2;")-pound class, come out any-
way; there is a four-pound allow-
ance in each class. If you. are
above this extended limit, you can
work the excess weight oﬁ.

In the heavyweight division the
boxing mentor is not so hard press-
ed. Two new try-outs, Irwin Arn-
ovitz, 223 pounds, and Geary
Kritchﬁeld, 207 " pounds, have re-
ported. These new men will give
,Shricker“something to work with.
, Withthe close of football season
ithe coach expects. Corace, winner
of last year's intra-mural tourna-
ment, Curly Stebbins, and Ted
Schmidtlto report. All three are
heavyweigh't_s.~  ~ ..

OPEN’ INVITATION

This, however, doesn’t mean
that the heavyweight position is
cinched. ’ Come out! , You’ll be sur-
prise'd”how quickly you can pick

. up the f;un_damenta.ls, and, with a

little ability you can possibly
make the team,

In the meantime, however, don’t

Leading Natators
I Stage Match
‘ ForTop. Honors

Senior ’.l‘om Locke, captain of
the -1937 Panther aquatic squad,
and Milton Lederstein, sophomore
sensation are staging a very friend-
ly, but lively, fued this season, the
wind-up of which will probably
settle the sup1‘eniacy in‘ ..the“‘22O
and 440 yard free-style.

Both Locke‘ and ’I.ede1‘stei_n are
well known for their prowess in
the swimining pool. _”The‘ Pitt cap-
tain has been on the team for four
years, but it has been only lately

that he has gained much attention. ,

Hailing‘ from South Hills High?
School,’ Locke came to Pitt with-‘E
little or no fzinfare. and only byi
constantly plugging has won his!
spurs as a top mte performer both
in the distance and in the back-
stroke.

SUD/IMER STAR

Lederstein, on the other hand,
came to Pitt along with his broth-
er Hyman, Al Beacon and Alex
Slabodian, known as the mainstay;
of the famous “Fifth Avenue i’our- V
some.” The older Lederstein
proved in his freshman year, and
during this past summer, that all
the praise heaped on him was en-
tirely just by vanquishing all com-
petition without too much diffi-
culty.

But, getting back to the Locke-
Lederstein rivalry, let it not be;
said that either of these two boysi
is trying to outdo the other and
leaving his team behind. In the:
case of Tom and Milt, each is
strictly team workers and personal
glory comes last. Both are mem-

' at Marshall college, Huntingdon,

W'hitehill produced this

Vvest Virginia, where he directed
productions’ of that sc‘nool’s dra-
matic group for two and one-half
years. He likes the play so well
that he gave his heasty.-approval
when Carl B. -Cass, ‘Players’ di-
rector, suggested “Ceiling Zero” as
oneof this year's plays. .. .

Last year at Marshall he also
produced “Accent on Youth,”
whi .1 Pitt Players will present
next April.

During ‘his days in the Yale
graduate school of dramatics, Mr.
Whitehill staged an ice show in
New Haven, Conn., starring Sonja
Henie, Karl Schaefer and Maribel
Vinson. indanuary, 1934.

Mr. Whitehill was an undergrad-
uate at Dartmouth college where
he was a member of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity.

RED BARN EXPERIENCE

For three summers he worked
at the Red Barn, Long Island, N.
Y., where Broadway producers
“try-out” plays later to be pre-
sented to New York’s theatre-goers
along the gay white way. De-
signer of all the sets at this “try-
out theater” was John Root, who
distinguished himself as the cre-

ator of the set for “Ceiling Zero”:

when it was staged on Broadway
two seasons ago, Mr. VVhitehill re-
calls.

Among the actors appearing in
the Red Barn plays were Gladys
Cooper, Phillip Merivale, Burgess
Meredith, James Stewart, Ruth
W'eston, Charles Trowbridge, Rich-
ard Cromwell, Rose Hobart, the
late Moffett Johnston, and Edward
Cianelli.

,_.PLAYS STAGED

Mr. pwhiteliill remembers stag-
ing such plays there as “S0 Proud-
ly We Hail,” “White Christmas,”
“Wisdom in Women,” “Seen But

Not Heard,” and ‘True to the Ma- 

rines.”
At the
Whitehill

“try-out.” theater
was known as

discomfort they took every oppor-
tunit}.y-'tg kidhim on this point.

ling to Dr. Omar (‘-. l_le](;l, as-
sistant dean of the College.

A receipt fr-«mt the treasurcr’s

office showing that the one dollar
examination fee has been paid
: must be presented in order to
Itake the test at 3:30 o’clock in 24

1 Arrangements may be made to
§ take the test at a later date at any
gone of ten special centers. How-
Q ever, the charge for late examina-
ftion will be ﬁve dollars.
 The tests, which have been con-
j ducted for the last seven years by
 the Association of American Med-
ical Colleges, have an important
fbearing on the consideration of
?the applicant’s admission to the
gschool of Medicines. It has been
Ifound that the tests have rather
 closely indicated the type of work
which the student later did in
 medical school.

It is not necessary that all pre-
medical requirements be complet-
ed at the time the test is given if
the requirements will befulﬁlled
in time for admission to the School
in the fall of 1938. ,

Students who took the‘ testilast
year but were not admitted to the
School. of Medicine should take a
re-examination at this time.

spetz claims
  Gyp,.Bi1sh§el,. 

“it may be a gyp,” Mr. Spotz

;but you won. Come up to 817
 Cathedral and collect.” ‘
 Such were the words of Tom
 Smith, C39, editor of the Panther,
 University’s erstwhile
‘magazine, as he announced the
winning by William Spotz, C40,
of the “Under the Bushelf’ contest
in the November Panther. ‘

Mr. Spotz turned in a card with
only two wrong out of 22. He at-
tributed the hardest true—false
tests to Dr. Gray instead of Dr.
Charlesworth, (he should only
know!)_. and placed Trinity college
at Cambridge, not Duke.

Also on Spotz’s card was a
word; several of them, in fact, in-
cluding “Frankly, Mr; Smith, I
think this is a gyp!” ’Smith rests
his case.

Local Attorney

The University has received a
bequest of $50,000 through the
will of E. VV. Smith, Pittsburgh

attorney, in memory of Mr.
Smith’s father, Curtis Benjamin
Miner Smith, member of the

Board of Trustees of the Univer-
sity from 1863 to 1873.

Curtis Smith was at one time
professor of classics in the Uni-
versity when it was known as the
VVestern University of Pennsylva-
gnia. While teaching he studied
Ilaw, and was admitted to the Al-
ilegheny County Bar in 1842.

“We hadua very interesting and
instructive trip, but it turned out
to be much more strenuous than
we had anticipated in the begin-

gineering, as these schools are
hoping to be accredited by the
‘American Institute of Chemical
