.AfterA Council Reconsider:

serve‘ as chairman of senior week

. and Asenior ball,‘ respectively. Both

appointments, made by the senior

In‘ V-endorsing‘ McCullough, Counci

. showed a reversal of attitude,‘ the f —

‘Week, previous having sent hisname
back to thAe._cabinet for further con-

 sideration- Fisher was ‘appointed
‘ after James Underwood, Bus. .Ad.,A

was disapproved by Council on the
ground that the position should go
to a -senior who had taken‘ a great-
‘erpart in extra-curricular activities.
Cabinet Members Present

Three members of the cabinet,
Ray ‘Montgomery, Bus. Ad., presi-
dent; James Mansman, Co1.,A Vand
Frank Burson, VEng., were present
at Tuesday.’s meetingto giveﬁargu-
mentsv Ainsupport of the men select-
ed_'andAVto “hear Council’s reasons for
failing to ratify McCullough at the
special meeting last week. When it
became‘ necessary to name another
choice for the chairman of the week,
the three cabinet members retired
from the AA meeting room and with the
aid of a proxy vote from E. E. Col»-
lips,‘ Dent,‘ who was absent, placed
the nameof Fisher before the gov-
erning body Afoi‘-’ immediate consider-
ation-J.’ He was accepted unanimously
on a motion made by Fred Lucas,
Bus. ‘Ad. ’31. ' , . ’

Arguments advanced against Mc-

similar to those presented a week
ago when his name failed of pas-
sage. Although several council mem-
bers believed‘ him capable of carry-
-ing out the work connected with the
position, they also felt that several

ﬂed for the appointment because of

greater. service performed during.
. their four years -at the University.

It was their opinion that the senior
weelkf chairmanships shou1d_bé re-

A garded as honorary positions and -
 givento‘ stu_de.Ants_ as a reward for

work «done in. activities.

The three cabinet members, led
15y "'Montg“oin’e‘ry,‘, ‘declared that ex-
ecutive an ' ‘organizing
should be the‘ primary qualiﬁca-
tions for the positions and that they
believed McCullough by. servi‘ngA;on
sAeveral_ undergraduate dance com-
mittees had demonstrated his thor-
oughness in this respect. They reit-
erated their former statement that
the matter had developed into an
‘issue’ to determine whether Council
or the cabinet had the prerogative
to make appointments for class po-
sitions. ‘ ‘

STRIKE DELAYS
  CAT|LnrRAL 

A strike of the hoisting engineers
working on the Cathedral-of Learn-
ing practically halted construction
on‘ the‘ building from February 27
to March 11. , ‘ V

‘The strike did not originate here
but was ordered by the Hoisting En-
gineers’ Union to apply to all -Stone
and ‘Webster ~ construction projects
throughout: the country in sympathy
with awalkout of the hoisting en-
gineers employed on a Stone and
Webster project in Hartford, Conn.

Building of the Falk Clinic, be-
cause of the slight need for hoist-

 

_of the strike, was little affected.

A Since‘ the date of settlement of
the .,-strike, March 11, building on
the Cathedral has gone forward
rapidly. Ten carloads of stone await
unoading in, the East Liberty yards
of the Pennsylvania Railroad and
more stone at the rate of two or
three carloads a day is being shipped
from Indiana. The tracery windows
of the Bigelow Boulevard wing of
the Cathedral are complete. About
800Acubic ‘feet are being set per day.

“ Elevator Tiling Continues

being continued at a fair’ rate. Til-
ing ‘of ’ the elevator shafts has

Omicron Delta Kappa, men’s na-
tional honorary activities fraternity,
is in the midst of a campaign to
raise $20,000 as a scholarship fund,

_ according to C. J. Phillips, local
president.

The interest, which will net $1,000
yearly may be given to any out-
standing Omicron Delta Kappa
senior in any college. The fund is to
be used for graduate work only. The
student may choose any university
in. the world. . . '

’ . .I.- Steele Gow, dean of administra-
.«;tion, and Chancellor John G. Bow-
man are members of the committee
;. that will choose-_ the candidates.
 «The idea of such a scholarship
;-..fund- was presented by Charles Wet-
— tach, alumni of. Pitt, now president
...;of the.=W. W. Lawrence Paint Com-
. pany, who .madc a large initial con-
_tribution. The plan was suggested
at the meeting of the National
=Council of the -Omicron Delta Kap-
pa fraternity here two years ago.
and was adopted at the Alabama
, conference a year later.
J. G. Quick, registrar, is chairman
fof the committee for raising the
fund at the University. Through his
“and the committee’s efforts, the Pit?
Gamma circle has raised $1,500 thi-
year, a greater amount than ‘any
other college has contributed so far.
'.The plan will go into effect as soon
‘as the fun}! is complete. ’

Most coeds admit they look to
“dates” for surcease from those
“too many lectures blues.” ,

But a few Pitt women get thrills
while they work. Tbetting all . the
dope on a. community political up-
heaval, chasing all over.Oakland to

never had an accident on his cor-
ner-—it’s all part of the. “home
work”- for the coeds who’ve‘ “gone
journalistic.” . I
.“I ‘like’. the ‘uncertainty of news-
paper work,” Berenice Gillette, Col.
.’30,.’ one ofthe mainstays of the
Oaklander, comments; “one never
knows whether a. story’s going to
be the ‘hit of the year or not. ‘And
then, think of the chances of meet-
tin celebrities!” Virginia Lewis,
Co. ’31, Berenice’s colleague, on the
Oaklander, -the Homewood-Brushton
News,- and the Hill-"Topper, agrees
that a journalist’s life is never a
‘dull. one. ~' ~ - .
— ' Work On Magazines“ .-
Their -days are full." Besides
runningthe three, local community
papers, each of » them works onla
magazine. Berenice does all- the
reporting for’ the Bulletin-Index,
Pittsburgh’s “New Yorker”; Vir-
ginia is editing a new trade maga-
zine in thefood produce ﬁeld.
When asked the inevitable, “How
do you» do‘ it all ?” Berenice admitted,
“It does keep me busy. Of course,
I1hav_e,to' budget all my time. More
remarkable are the twenty credits
Berenice carries iniaddition to her
newspaper work. _“When do ‘I
study?” Uusually from six toeight
in the morning.’ And I; manage to
find time‘ for «datesa few evenings
a week]? ..Betweenv times, Berenice
acts-’inUPitt Players. ' .- '
, -Next summer Berenice intends to

Journalism back to Corry high
school, where she edited the —“High»
Times.” Graduating from Ogontz’
ﬁnishing school at Philadelphia in
’28,_ she came to Pitt to make jour-
nalism her profession. -

Features Hobby

Virginia Lewis just about parallels

Berenice, though her particular
hobby is features. She is assign-
ment editor of the 0aklander,- and
co-managing editor of the Hill Top-
per, and Homewood-Brushton News,
besides working on her rnazazine
and writingfeatures. No onecould
be more ardent, oz‘-_ enthusiastic and
indeﬁnite.
know why she likes journalism. just
realizes she drifted into‘ it because
she liked to write and had worked
on a school paper, andvknows she'll
never tire of the hurry and the
tenseness of the newspaper office.
_ Ruth Reebel, Col. ’31, is on the‘
“South Hills Economist” staff ‘and
Ethel M. Danforth, Col. '31, another
journalist, is feature writer and sub-
editor of the “East Liberty Trib-
une.” Bilorelfexninists who express
themselves by way of the printed
page and absorb technique‘ through
classes in journalism include Elaine
Foraker. Col. ’32, a reporter for the
Oaklander; Madeline Enderlin, Col.
’32, Pittsburgh correspondent for
the Greensburg Tribune; Claire
Timlin. Col. ’32; Margaret Scher-
rnerhorn,'Col. ’32, and Bernice Da-
vidson, Col. ’32, all on the Oakland-
er staff.‘ -

Like medicine andbusiness, jour-
nalism is a, ﬁeld long considered‘
strictly masculine, yet readily adap-
table to feminine perseverance, and
perhaps, inquisitiveness. For what
woman wouldn't go _out of her way
to satisfy her curiosity?

For-a long time college undergraduates have been struggling along
under the burden of «obeying or breaking the Eighteenth Amendment and
Volatoad Act. ‘The maiori-ty of students. at least in schools other
tiara!-;.P.i.-ﬁt. have been breaking them.‘ It has been an unhappy. hypocritical

situation forjevervbody and nothing is -more clear than that a change

(audit. can’t be for the worse) is inegvitable.

Although‘ We really do not have a liquor Problem on this campus’
and most faculty and .administrative ofiicers agreeiPitt is among‘ the
“'tl¥7¢§t” of colleges. We are deeply interested in the situation throughout
tho country. . y ‘

' Next Monday the "Pitt Weekly, in co-operation with organizations
{fromtwenty-ﬁve other‘ prominent schools, will attempt to discover What
students here think _about,the drinking problem by conducting a compre-
honsive poll in all schools of the University. This newspaper is serious
in itsattenapt to secure the true sentiment and the entire ballot wi11.be
‘thrown out if. it becomes apparent students-are not entering into the
proper spirltiin marking their ballots. The results of this poll are cer-
 to attraetipublicity in this section as well as in other parts of the
country. ' ' .
V GT1;-to following excerpt is from the Harvard University Crimson. the
newspaper which is in charge of the college poll: I ‘ . '

' “'ﬁ1¢re is value in broadcasting the strong resentment that obtains
an American cainpi against the conditions which have followed. the puden-
forced Eighteenth Amendment and in arguing. the whole matter back"-and
forth. For better or for worse, the college men of today, and there are
Tm: 8. million of thein, will be the leaders of tomorrow, and their opinion
must boot real value and force. _ V _

_ “Through their under-graduate publications and other organizations,
i=hey,ha'.ve excellent media through which to voice. their sentiments. Hith-
erto,Tlittle-oonce’rted use has been made of these facilities to express stu-
dent opinion on national affairs, but the evils of prohibition come soclosc
 college m,en"both during and after their under-graduate days that it
more than legitimate for the collegiate press to step out of its
usual role o_£.disinterested observer. To keep under cover the unpleasant
sores of prohibition, which can be cured only by being opened, is to post-
tone the arrival of a. happier solution" of the problem of temperance.”

STAY INPEN TO
WIN CAGE TILT

Coach Carlson and his desperate
pack of “Golden Pan.thers’? were in
jail last Sunday.

<1:)leT1:1s, but they were playing basket-

a . . -

_ Quite _a queer place to be play-
ing but ll’. all came as the result of
a letter received by Coach Carlson
from the warden of the Rockview
Penitentiary
the inmates of the cells would like
to meet the Panthers. 3 H , .

Dr. Carlson. was -Avery obliging
and agreed -to, play the jailbirds as
it was a stop-o,ver_ on the way back
from Penn State, but he made the
warden” promise that there wouldn’1
be any.riots. The warden talked it
over with ‘the prisoners, and as
they promised to be good "for they
crlilldege lads» the game was‘ sched-
u e .

 

Game Proves Easy

Charley Hyatt and his pals were
a httle frightened at the assign-
1_‘n§I1l3.at first but on ' entering the
Jail, and seeing the docile looks on
the faces of the‘ inmates their’ fears
were quickly dispelled. ’ ,

The game proceeded and the Pan-
thers soon proved their superiority
by establishing a large lead at the
end of the half. Instead of resting
between periods the players were
entertained by a. gunman from Phil-
adelphia who sang to the accom-
paniment of _a bandit from Pitts-
bU1',£',’ll. The boys were highly pleased

and applauded vigorously. .

After the music the Panthers
quickly settled to the game in
hand. They ran up bucket after
bucket and when the game ended
they had won by the overwhelming
score of 50-23. The boys
amazed at the ﬁnevgrade of sports-
manship displayed by the hosts as
they gave the Panthers a big hand
for all the ﬁne plays executed. Hy-

att was high point... scorer ‘with
eight buckets.
The warden showed the boys

around after the game, letting them
‘see the prisoners getting lined up
for the meal, a total of nine liundred
being seated in nineteen minutes.
Coach »Carlson,_. _Les Cohen and
Charley Hyatt visited the execution
chamber. ﬂlule the restvof theboys

V »The following-is the iirst oil
a series of articles on the‘‘Fun- ,
damentals of Tennis,” by Eddie
Jacobs, former national boys’
champion‘ ‘and present ‘ captain
of the Pitt tennis team. In his‘. ‘
initial article Jacobs deals with '
the dévelopmentof the stroke. =

“By.EI)DIE JACOBS , *

~ Captain, Pitt Tennis Team
Until the ‘year 9.1914 stroke pro-
duction was conﬁned « to the old
-Lawford drive. It was a ball which

_was extremely I,heavily topped,faI.1dg
 ";.t_his was a sacrifice. of speed for.pre--
ieision. This drive, however, required

an immense amount of energy and
stamina. - I ,
From out of "sunny-‘ California
came William M.‘ Johnston withhis
I ‘It became
known as the Western stroke. _ It
was a ﬂat‘ drive obtained by holding
the face of the racquet parallel ‘to
the ground. ,The swing is s‘tar_ted
back, as far as possible and turning
the racquet in theair so that when
the ball and racquet come into con-
tact, they are perfectly ﬂat. In the
follow through‘ -the racqueti will turn’
by its own volition,‘ guiding the ball
to the desired place; and at the same
t_ime keep the ball within the ‘base

line. -
Tilden Simpliﬁes Stroke“

Then came Bill: Tilden, with his
famous Eastern strokes.‘ They sim-
pliﬁed the .Western, inasmuch as the
racquet was merely held out perpen-
dicular. to the ground. It‘ looks like
it is an-extension of‘ the arm, and
the racquet .is ‘brought. straight
through from the shoulder._At_the
end of this stroke’ there is aﬁsimi-‘

 

_,..

.cen_tly from study in ..European uni-
versities, will speak on» ‘The’, Vita-

lar tendency,‘ as the -.Western pro-
vides, which turns the__ racquet and
keeps the _ball in-the. c0.urt., This

 

pro‘ved—~ a ‘va_st; improvement. over. the
Western strokes because it ‘did away
with ‘the complete circlej -prior ‘to
coming in contact with the ball.
An.d..now the evolution ofsstroke,

production has evolved “into its ﬁnal

stage. Those who are. mainly instru-
mental in this revolution are. none
other than. two of the famous Mus‘-;
keteers,‘ Rene Lacoste. and Henri
Cochet. During -a‘ conversation with

‘William T. Tilden, he ,told"the'writer

that ‘undoubtedly; the French» » game
was the. soundest. of all. Heiwent so
far as to . say that if he were ten
years ?younger he; would "adopt . this,
method, in preference to 1 any other
hehadgseen-. “  _ '- _
5. This -‘method of stroke production

Eliminates Hard Swing

The .face ' of the "racquet is held‘ at
aislight angle facing . toward the

“sky. The swing is very short, but

theball is taken on the rise which
eliminates, the necessity of hitting
t,he‘ball hard inorder to getit out
of reach ofyour opponent. You get

an extreme angle on the shotif you

handle it delicately- It doesaway
with the risk of hitting the .ball_
hard, and the ‘chances ‘of inakingthe
shot are. much -greater than those. of

any of the previous strokes.

‘which _will. appear, next ‘week, will

deal with the fundamentals’ of foo‘-

AF-oi-mer Star Takes Up New
Duties At Spi-ingiDrills

 

Andy Gustafson, former Pitt full-
back, and a good one at that, is here
and very happily so, as the assistant
to his former mentor, Coach Suth-

erland. ' -He ﬁlls the shoes left emp
ty by. Charley Bowser, now head
coach at Bowdoin College. If rec~
ords and good football sense help

any, Gustafson looks like a sure suc-
I cess. - '

Obviously, Gustafson is'glad to

igetiback to his alma mater, not be-

cause he was in the least dissatis-
ﬁed with his enjoyable stay atu,Vir‘-

-ginia Polytechnic Institute, in the

capacity of head coach, but

to get back to his old alma mater

, and Jock Sutherland, whom» he hon,-

estly considers to be one of the ﬁn’-
est coaches in the country today.

Developed Good Teams L

Norfolk, Va., is the present home

town of the new assistant coach, but
he intends to lift stakes and mi-

grate to Pittsburgh next fall.

During Gustafson‘s head‘ coach-
‘ship at Virginia Tech, the football
‘teams turned in some ﬁne records.
In 1928 the team under .his leader-
ship copped second place - in th
Southern ‘Conference Football
.League. This was the year when
Georgia Tech went to the coast to
participate in "the Rose Bowl tour-
nament. In that same year Gus-
tafson’s pigskin toters defeated , a
classy Colgate .team 6 to

b lity. .His ability was recognized

It was
here, under the tutelage of a for-
mer Pitt quarterback, Billy Robin-
son, that he first commenced to
shine. g Later, when he was about
to graduate, Coach Robinson per-
sifzaded him i to attend the Univer-
‘sity of Pittsburgh. -

In his freshman year, Gustafson
played fullback on one‘ of “Doc”
Carlson’s classy frosh grid teams.
The next year he earned his berth

_"as fullback on the last Pitt team
to he coached by.Pop Warner.

that Gustafson first made the ac-
quaintance of that tall silent Scot
who -was to. compile suchenviable
records in the next few years.

But it remained
for [Gnstafson’s last year to mark
the first really successful season of

L Dr- Sutherland as a coach at Pitt.

ous schedule dropping only one bit-

This year, after four very suc-
cessful years at Virginia Tech, Gus-
tafson came back to the school
which holds so many vivid memories
of him. He is to assist mainly in
coaching the backﬁeld, having the
job almost, to himself. Thus far.
Mr. Gustafson tells us‘ that he
knows little about the backﬁeld pros-
pects. “I’ve only seen them doinr
calisthenics, and I ‘can’t really tell‘
how capable. a man maybe until
I have seen him‘ in some scrimmage.
Well one thing is? certain, we’ll
need a good backﬁeld to go through
the schedule- that we have mapped
out for us next season.” ‘
