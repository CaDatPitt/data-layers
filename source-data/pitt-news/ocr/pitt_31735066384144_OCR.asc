Pitt's Budget Crisis: The Students Give Their Views

By ANGELE ELLIS
and MARK MURPHY

Pitt News Staff Writer

Ninety percent of the students
polled in an informal Pitt News
survey believe there is a money
crisis at Pitt, but only 20 percent
blame the University administra-
tion. 1

When asked, “Is there a money
crisis at Pitt?” 90 percent of the 100
students polled answred yes, four
answered no and six didn’t now.
When the same people were asked,
“Who is to blame?” 20 percent
blamed Pitt’s administration, 57

percent blamed legislators in

L 7"‘ ' ' arrisburg and 23 percent said they

 

A didn’t know whose fault it was.

Allocation

Guidelines
Revamped  

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
A new Student Government
Board Allocations process pro-
posal, which will divide budgetary
procedures into three separate

aﬁgpropriations bills, was presented

to members of the SGB Assembly
yesterday.

A “Governmental Appropri-
ations Bill” Wlll include a budget
for the SGB and for all the standing
committees in one package. The
chairmen for the standing commit-
tees will prepare their budgets in
conjunction with the SGB presi-
dent. In previous years, standing
committee budgets were con-

(Continued on Page 2)

The survey, conducted last week
in the Cathedral, Student Union,
Towers and Hillman Library, also
brough forth student solutions to
the ﬁscal problem.

“Students should write to their
legislators, but Ithink more drastic
action is needed,” said Timothy
O'Neil, a senior political science
and Russian major. “The school
should shut down for a day in
protest.” .

“At least two other students
vehemently disagreed with the
letter writing suggestion.

“Letter writing doesn’t work,” a
senior speech major said. “It’s
ridiculous to think that it does. The
Chancellor wants us all to write
letters to our legislators, but they

The shape of things to come...what does the crystal ball reveal tor

don’t care what the college students
say. They only listen to the people
with the big do_llars:” . _ ”
“Letter writing is asinine. a
freshman said. “It’sbeen tried, but

 

it never works. What they ought to
do is go and bring about ﬁve

busloads of people to Harrisburg.

The legislators will start to worry

Pitt’s future?

when all the students show up."

According to senior Greg Porter.
any action might be unnecessary.
He feels the appropriations battle
will end soon.

“The money crisis will be taken
care by the third week in
November,” Porter said. “The
University is too vital to collapse.
We’ll get the appropriations.”

When asked, “Is student govern-
ment doing a good enough job in
trying to bring an end to the
problem?” 38 percent of the
students said yes, 27 percent said
no and 35 percent didn’t know.

While many people polled gave
student government high marks for
trying, others were highly critical of
its efforts.

“What can they do?” a junior
biology major asked. “Student
government doesn’t have any
power in Harrisburg.”

‘ ‘Student government never does
anything,” a senior said. “All I
read is that this person quit, this
person’s on.” ’

“Student government is trying.
but they’re not making progress.
They get an ‘E’ for effort,” said
Vickie Vanderhoof, a senior theater
major.

“Student government hasn't
acoomplishedtoo much. I read
about Bernie Payne (SGB presi-
dent) taking a plane to Harris-
burg,” ‘senior chemistry major
Chris Mostowy said.

Pitt's Lobbying Effort
Faces Crucial SG Vote

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News Staff Writer
The Student Government Board

is expected to act on a budget,

recommendation today that would
fund transportation to Tuesday's
student rally in Harrisburg, and at
least three Board members have
indicated they will vote against the
request. ‘

The Student Government Alloca-
tions Committee last night was
expected to approve some $2,S00in
travel funds requested by the
Student Government Task Force on
Higher ‘Education, and a ﬁnal
decision is expected to come from a
SGB meeeting at 8 a.m. today.

The allocations, if approved,
would enable at least six busloads of
Pitt students to journey to the state

capital to lobby for prompt
legislative passage of approved
funds to Pennsylvania's four
state-related universities.

While being “guardedly opti-
mistic” that the board will hand
down an affirmative decision, SBG
president Bernie Payne said last
night the vote will be close.

‘‘It’s too close to tell what’ the
board’s ﬁnal decision will be,”

Payne said, adding he will vote for

the funding.

“l’m behind the rally 100
percent. 1 think we have a moral
obligation to Terriple and Penn
State,” he said.

Statements by board members
last night suggested the ﬁnal vote

will be 4-3 in favor.

Tucker Urges Black Involvement in Politics

By BETSY NORMAN

Pitt News Staff Writer

fwlack political activist and

Qformer Commonwealth Secretary

  

C. Delores Tucker urged blacks,
particulary young people, to use
the power of the ballot in affecting
social and political change in a
speech to Pitt students Wed-
nesday.

“We will never truly change

' anything until we get our hands on

the levers of power,” Tucker said.

“We must be part of the
decision-making process. From
conception to resurrection, our

       
   

process and we had better be
involved in it.”

Tucker explained many politi-
cians felt. they need not be
concerned with the black com-
munity during campaigns,
“because they don’t vote anyway.”

“We must change this,” the
50-year-old ex-secretary said.

A member of the Democratic
National Committee, the National
Women’s Political Caucus and
Vice-President of the Pennsylvania
chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People, Tucker recently was ﬁred

misuse of state property and
employees for personal gain.
Shapp accused her of using her
staff to write personal speeches.

Tucker refused comment on the
case on the advice of her counsel.

Tucker’s speech was part of
“Black week,” sponsored by the
Black Action Society.

“I like both those words, black
and action. You,’ black youth,
symbolize action,” Tucker said.

“This is our country. Our roots

‘ are here. We spilled blood for this

country in the wars. We sweat in

railroads. There is a great deal of
black in the red, white and blue.

“Our political apathy is forging
chains for our children and
grandchildren. We no longer face
police lines; we face unemployment
lines. We no longer must sit in the
back of the bus; we are faced with
the problem of ﬁnding money for
the fare.

“The American dream is just
that-—a dream.”

Tucker said she believed all»

people are one family under God.
‘ “If we could get that message

people—that we are all one
family——-we wouldn’t need the
Black Action Society or the Black
Women’s Caucus or the Interna-
tional Women’s Year. Unfor-
tunately, that is not the case and
that is why the struggle must go
on.

“I urge all of you here to keep on
moving forward in the education
process. Remind your peers that
black isn’t beautiful when it’s dull.
Encourage them, serve as tutors
for them. Involve yourself in your
community. Serve as a model. You

sidered separately by the Alloca-
tions Committee.

The package will then go before
SGB for approval at a public
meeting. If the bill is rejected, it
must be returned to the president
for alteration. The amended bill
must meet SGB approval within
seven days.

Campus governing groups such
as the Resident Student Associa-
tion, Panhellenic Association,
Black Action Society and the
Intrafraternity Council will submit
their budgets in one package to the
Allocations Committee in a
‘_‘_Governmental Services Appropria
tions Bill.” These organizations
will have a chance to discuss their
budgets beforehand with SGB, and
will be able to appeal any
allocations recommendations dur-
ing budget hearings.

“The emphasis now is on
discussion beforehand to minimize
the chances of budget cuts.” Josh
Baylson, SGB member and As-
sembly president. said.

Remaining funds will be allo-
cated to the recognized student
organizations who must present
their budgets to the Allocations
Committee. The SGB will set ﬁve
categories of allocations, operating
expenses, athletic/recreational.
programming, services and special
interest setting monetary limits for
each.

The Allocations Committee must
then submit these budgets to the
board in a package known as the
‘ ‘General Appropriations Bill.’ ’
The SGB must accept or reject the
package in its entirety. If it is
‘rejected, the Allocations Commit-
tee must revise the appropriations
bill.

In other business, Baylson said a
complete listing of the addresses
and phone numbers of all student
organizations on campus would
appear in The Pitt News beginning
Jan. 18.

Pitt Lobbying Effort
Pending SGB Vote

(Continued from Page 1)

SGB member Dave Garger said
he would vote in favor, although he
said he would change his mind if
shown that radical elements might
become involved the rally.

“I’m for funding the travel
funds,” Garger said, “but not if
people point out the rally will do
severe damage to our future state
appropriations.

“If I see evidence of a radical
group, I will not vote for the
funding,” be said. “If this gets out
of control, the whole thing can blow
up in our faces.”

SGB member Josh Baylson said
he would not approve the funds,
claiming the_ rally was not

well-planned. “Unless I'm shot? K 

the rally is well-organized, I’ll vote
against it,” he said. “As of now. I
don’t think it is well-organized.”

Despite the uncertainty over the
funding, task force members met
last night to discuss Tuesday's
lobby.

Task force co-chairman Kathy
McCauley briefed the small gather-

Asked by a reporter what the task

It appears Student Government Board president Bernie Payne ------ --

. . . . . . . ' .'

spoke a little hastily Tuesday when he assured the Task Force on
Higher Education funds would be allotted for transportation to
next Tuesday’s budget crisis rally in Harrisburg.

Late last night, at least two board members, Dave I-Iesidence and
Josh Baylson, indicated they were not in favor of paying for the
buses. Board member Judy Berl was reported to be wavering, but
Payne said he expected her to vote in favor of funding at today’s 8
a.m. emergency board meeting. All other board members
indicated they favored spending the $2,500 for transportation, so it
appeared the measure would pass 5-2 or 4-3.

Payne said the 8 a.m. board meeting was necessitated by
schedule conflicts that would prevent a quorum beingpresent in the
afternoon. He expressed concern the early hour would prevent
student attendance at the meeting.

We also are concerned with the board’s failure to live up to its
committment to easily accessible meetings, and we feel the situation
could have been avoided had a little more foresight been employed
by president Payne. If he had not, in the first place, unilaterally
assured the Task Force on Higher Education bus fundingiwould be
approved, ‘lie could have avoided the llth-hour polling of the
Allocations Committee that resulted in this morning’s meeting.

Still, we hope the board will approve transportation funding at
its unfortunately timed meeting. Payne says the legislators haven’t
seen enough people, and we think he’s right. Although the
administration refuses to support the rally, it hasn’t condemned it,
and recent statements by Chancellor Posvar indicate the
seriousness of the situation is not unrecognized behind the stone
facade of the Cathedral. ’

The persistent inaction of the legislature is compelling evidence
polite lobbying in three-piece suits will probably not be effective.
Student activism may be our last best hope.

No Bumping and Grinding  

When I ﬁnished reading Ann
Butler’s article on the Golden Girls
in the Oct. 30 Pittsburgh Press, I
was ﬁt to be tied. This so-called
writer went to great lengths to
exhibit her gall and extreme bad
taste. I was a majorette for three
years in high school, and plan to

    Bible Thumping and Leaky Arguments W

By GARY GOVERT

Pitt News Staff Writer

I can’t resist commenting on two
letters appearing in The Pitt News’
November 8th issue, both of which
were highly critical of Steve Shope’ s
recent Bible-thumping condem-
nation of homosexuality (Letters,
Nov.7).

Your arguments were forceful,
gentlemen, but they leaked.

they perform. They do not bump or
grind. As far as their being
burlesque dancers, Ihave never
seen them shed a stitch of
clothing. Have you? The Golden
Girls are good at what they do, and
what they do is good.

Kathy McCloy
CAS Freshman

The common thread running
through both letters was t e
assumption that, if justice is to
prevail, personal values must be
kept separate from public policiy.
Surely, the writers said, Shope had
injected liberal (if that's the right
word) doses of his belief system into
his diatribe against homosexuality.

Unfortunately, the two critics did
not live up to their own standards of
objectivity.

Letters To The Editor

Commuter Laments Campus Vandalism

Everyone always says, ‘‘It never
will happen to me, ’ ’ but what do you
do if it does? Vandalism and theft of
commuters’ cars is . becoming a
more prominent problem than ever.
What do you do when your
eight-track or cassett player is
stolen? Unless you. have special
insurance coverage, nothing can be
done and you're out $100 or more.
This goes for CB’s also. How do you
study for a test that is a week away
when your books and/ or notes have
been stolen? Recently, my car was
vandalized and $200 in property was
taken, not to mention the damage
done to the car.

I would like to give commuters
who drive to the University a few
hints I wish I had known. To
prevent vandalism, you should
install a burglar alarm and post a
decal with a warning in the window.
If you can’t afford an alarm, buy a
decal and put that in the window.
Many times a thief won’t take a
chance if he doesn’t have to.

If your car has -vents, wire them
shut so they cannot be pried open.
Often, this is the easiest and
quickest means of entry. Do not
leave your window cracked open,

One letter maintained that Shope
could not prove the existence of God
or the divinely-instilled validity of
the Bible. Therefore, the argument
went, such sources are unreliable as
indicators of truth and are
inadmissible as evidence in support
of Shope’s claims.

Not bad—except the writer did
not mention that he cannot disprove
Shope’s assumptions. Instead, he
declared Shope’s conclusion ridi-
culous and based upon faulty
premises, with barely a word about
the premises themselves. Then,
somehow, the writer decided that
he would be forced to be a Christian
if Shope ran the country, a
conclusion for which I can ﬁnd no
stated premise at all.

The other letter was similar.
Mixing personal convictions (i.e.,
religious beliefs) with public policy
will mean the end of freedom, the
writer implied. Furthermore,
homosexuality is “none of the
Almighty’s business.”

I must say I enjoyed the irony
when the writer said to Shope,
‘ ‘Your assumptions are simplistic.’ ’

Neither writer seems to realize
there is no such thing as separating

even if you have theft-proof lock
knobs. You may even try taking
them completely off.

This sounds like a lot of trouble,
but it may save you money and two
hours in the police station. It seems
unreal that people would do
something like this, but since you
can’t babysit your car all day, you
have to do something.

In the event your car did have
something taken from it, try not to
touch anything. If possible, take
your car to the campus police
station; they are very kind and will
ﬁngerprint your car for you. Many
times, a thief leaves prints on

windows that have been pried open
or on something they tried to take
but couldn’t get loose. Also, cllc
for witnesses in nearby parked car .
These are not sureﬁre methods, but
they may prevent a theft or aid in
the return of stolen property. If only
one person makes use of this letter,
and it prevents a theft from that
person's car, this letter was worth
writing.

Don’t let all this go to waste; for
all you know, someone may be
hitting or casing your car right now.
Protect your property!

Name Withheld By Request

Task Force Too Conservative

I attended a meeting of the
Student Government Task Force on
Higher Education recently, and
came out feeling very disillusioned.
The impression I received was that
the members of the task force are
taking a conservative attitude, by
suggesting politicking and making
good impressions on members of
the Legislature rather than de-
manding the money due to the
students of the state-related
universities.

ion, no way to keep private beliefs
from inﬂuencing public policy. The
two realms are mutually inclusive.

Every decision made by man,
every law instituted by government,
is founded upon and supported by
some personal or cultural belief
system. And every belief system is
founded upon faith.

For instance, some American
policymakers pride themselves on
their pragmatism. They make
decisions based upon utilitarian
calculations of possible good vs.
possible evil. As a result, their
decisions are free from ideological
and religious bias, right?f

Wrong. Merely by deciding upon
a pragmatism as the best means to
practical policy formulation, the
decision-makers have made a
fundamental choice that is ultimate-
ly based on faith. They believe in
their system. They do not believe in
some other system, perhaps
Shope’s.

It might be argued the decision to
be a pragmatist is based on reason
rather than faith. Perhaps, but
accepting reason as a reliable guide

‘to action .-is ultimately an act of

faith—faith in reason. In other

It seems the most effective way
for a more efﬁcient task force is
through a wider student participa-
tion. If anyone is interested in
having a Pitt to come back to in
January, I would strongly recom-
mend participation in the task
force. More diversity of student
views is needed.

his critics’ Bible-denying are
equally acts of faith, with equal
“proof” possibility.

As acts of faith, they're religious
expressions. So what we have here
is two critics berating Shope
because his religious convictions do
not agree with theirs. I may not
entirely agree with Shope, but Iﬁnd
myself wondering ever more about
his critics’ reasoning. What ever

Reader Calls

 For Africa

Support

I am writing to urge all University
staff and students who oppose the
political and economics repression
of the governments of South Africa
and Rhodesia to support Saturday’s
demonstration downtown at the
County Courthouse. It is well
known that U.S. investments
protect the current regimes in these
countries, and, despite our govern-
ment’s stand on human rights, the
U.S. used its veto in the United
Nations to defeat the economic

_ .S_anctions that could have affected
Qiiange there.

Serious moves
against the current governments of
Rhodesia and South Africa repre-
sent such a threat to U.S.‘ corporate
interests that our government will
not change its policy without mass
opposition from the people of this
country. Mass demonstrations
supporting the liberation movement
will show a first-term president that
the people of this country are in fact
concerned about human rights
throughout the world.

Saturday’s demonstration begins
at noon at the County Courthouse.

To Dry Your Hair ?

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

By now, everyone has discovered
the merits of hand-held hair dryers.
Along with the benefits of
producing a reasonable Farrah
facsimile without baking under a
conventional dryer for three hours
comes the inevitable—your dryer
blows up.

Since it has been estimated a
blow dryer pressed into daily use
has a one—year life span, sooner or
later your Conair Pro will shoot
sparks, sending you flipping
through catalogues and wandering
through department stores in
search of a replacement.

  Women’s Rights Questioned

By DAN McKAY

Since 1973, women have enjoyed
the legal right to choose abortion
until the third trimester, when faced
with an unwanted pregnancy. Now,
this right is being challenged, more
strongly than ever, on both the state
and Federal levels.

The Supreme Court’s decision in
the case of Roe v. Wade established
that the right to choose abortion was
based on the Court’s view of the
right to privacy. It also stated a
fetus is not a person, according to
the Constitution. Justice Harry
Blackmun, who drafted the Court’s
opinion, maintained the choice is an
indivisible part of every American’s
“liberty,” protected by the due
process clause of the 14th
amendment.

The pro-life forces, outraged by
the 1973 Supreme Court decision,
now are pressing for a Constitu-
tional Convention. If the Constitu-
tion were amended, an article
guaranteeing the right to life from
the moment of conception would be
included. .

Opponents of the Constitutional

Convention are afraid it would
subvert the entire 14th Amend-
ment, as well as other parts of the
Constitution. They doubt the
changes made could be limited to
the abortion issue. Ellen Doyle,
executive director of the Pittsburgh’
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union (A.C.L.U.),
believes, “If you overrule Roe v.
Wade by a Constitutional Conven-
tion, you undermine the concept of
privacy that evolved in a series of
cases involving contraceptives,
marital privacy and non-inter-
ference of government in personal
affairs.” -

Pennsylvania's Legislature is
moving to support a convention.
The House of Representatives
overwhelmingly passed a resolution
calling for such a convention. The
resolution is now before a Senate
committee chaired by Senator
Edward Early (D-North Hills). A
hearing by the committee was
scheduled to be held in Pittsburgh a
week from today, but was
postponed indeﬁnitely.

Early, who has always voted
ain§t°abortion_ bills,  he is _

anticipate a close vote,” he said.
He added he was going to let Martin

Mullen (D-Philadelphia), the
“expert and leader” of anti-
abortion measures, draft the

Senate's version.

Early said that he is against any
government spending for Welfare
recipients’ abortions, although he
admitted this source discriminates
against poor women.

Doyle, on the other hand, said,
“It’s terrible that we’re not seeing
more support for the poor women's
rights.”

If the bill proposing the
Constitutional Convention passes
both houses, Pennsylvania will be
the 10th state to pass such a
resolution. .

Two-thirds of the 50 states must
pass it before Congress must start
choosing delegates, a site rules
procedures.

“Nobody knows exactly how it
would be run,” said Jeff Garin, a
legislative assistant for Senator
John Heinz III (R-Pa.).

“The whole idea (of the
convention) is to circumvent
Congress,” Garin said. He
intimated pro-lifers are going this
route because the chairmen of both
the U.S. House and Senate
Judiciary Committees are pro-
choice.

The real action in Washington is
in the House-Senate Conference
Committee that is deadlocked on an
appropriation bill for the depart-
ment of Health, Education _ and
Welfare (HEW). The reason is a
disagreement over the proposed
Hyde Amendment. Most House
conferees oppose any appropriation
for abortions. Most Senate
conferees, however, want strong
provisions for Federally funded
abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape or incest, and in
cases in which the woman’s health
or life is endangered by continued
pregnancy and delivery.

The deadlock has HEW
employees enraged because their
paychecks are held up as part of the
bill. \

President Carter has come out
against Federal spending for
abortions. He is also opposed to a

Constitutional Convention, stating
the" Sup. I.ne..Court,..m1!nss are

weight of law. He said he would do
everything possible to minimize the
need for abortions. “Every
abortion,” he said, “is proof of a
failure to prevent an unwanted
pregnancy. ’ ’

The New York Times,
13-state check, revealed:

In nearly every state, abortion
rights advocates have failed to
equal the opponent's network of
dedicated activists and steady, if
often modest, contributors.

While anti-abortion groups have
a reputation for “single-issue”
activism, they have alliances and
commonalities with groups‘ that
range from those fighting to “Stop
the Equal Rights Amendment! ” to
“Stop the Panama Canal
Giveawayl”

Groups favoring legalized abor-
tion overlap widely with organized
advocates of civil, feminist and
welfare rights, as well as with
family-limitation proponents such
as Zero Population Growth. The
effect is to increase their strength in
some ways, to diffuse money and
activism, in others.

With approximately 1.3 million
abortions performed annually, it is
surprising abortion advocates have
not had the political clout of the
anti-abortionists. '4 ‘

“I would like to see all those
women whc’.ve had abortions to
come out; .and cry on "their
legislator’s shoulders,” said Ellen
Doyle.

When shopping it is wise to do
the following: (1) buy only a brand
name as it is easier to get a Max
repaired than a Woolworth’s
bargain basement special; (2)
check the warranty; ‘and (3) get the
dryer best suiting your needs.

The types of blow dryers fall into
three main categories—pistol,
brush and styler/dryers—each
with several different brands and

uses. _ --,

Pistol Dryers

Pistol dryers are the kind favored

by most salons, but, when you’re
using one by yourself, it requires
the most expertise and dexterity.
You must balance the dryer in one
hand, and twist with a comb O1
styling brush with the other. The
advantage of a pistol dryer is it
dries fastest and usually generates
the most power (up to 1200 watts).
The main disadvantage is hairs can
get twisted through the mesh
grating at the nozzle end and may
eventually catch on ﬁre. ’

Almost every store carries its
version of the basic pistol drysgr‘
but the biggest sellers are from
Clairol and Conair.

Clairol: a newcomer to the dryer
scene, but the 1200-watt Son of a
Gun is gaining in popularity. It has
three heat settings and two air ﬂow
settings on a slide switch, and a
concentrater nozzle is included.
Price is around $20.

Conair: Probably the best known
of any type of dryer, the Super Pro
has four different heat settings, but
the two switch setting mechanisms
is confusing and hard to read. It

  A DECLARATION  
OF COMMON CONCER

   
 

l

for Our Colleges
  an

/

We, the undersigned, representing all walks of life throughout this

Commonwealth, declare our common concern for the crisis which
confronts our colleges and universities. We urge that it be resolved

without further delay.

Irwin

Pennsylvania’s colleges and universities are vital to our welfare.

They educate our young people; they renew the skills and perspectives
of our citizens; they develop new knowledge; they preserve our culture;
they improve our health and our daily lives; and they contribute to our
economic well-being. In short, Pennsylvania’s universities and colleges
serve the public purpose and deserve full public support.

For our state-related and state-aided universities, the appropriations

received from the Commonwealth are essential to their very existence.
For our private universities and colleges, Institutional Assistance Grants
are crucial to their ability to continue to serve a broad cross-section of
the young people of Pennsylvania. Without the passage and funding of

the needed appropriation acts, the future Of higher education in

Pennsylvania is in jeopardy.

Ronstadt Is A ‘Heat Wave’ Onstage

ByKEITHBR1AN

Tuesday, Nov. 8, while Richard
Caliguiri was winning the votes of
Pittsburghers, Linda Ronstadt was
winning their hearts at the Civic
Arena.

A crowd of over 11,000 cast a
favorable response to the evening's
20-song ballot. The ﬁrst tune,“Ball
and Chain,” got the momentum
started, and carried it into “That’ll
Be the Day."

Ronstadt, at center stage. held
the microphone "stand and dedi-
cated to the roadies a trucking
song, “I’m Willin’.” Clarity of
sound was impressive throughout
the concert. Distortion and rever-
beration were held to a surprising
minimum, despite the poor acoutis-
ties at the Arena.

During “Faithless Love," Kenny
Edwards, the band’s bass player,
showed his versatility by playing
the banjo. Ronstadt displayed a
vocal range of over four octaves.

Then Ronstadt turned around,
picked up a guitar, and started into
“You Won’t Matter Anymore.”
Ronstadt demonstrated that she
isn't just a chord strummer.

After “Poor, Poor Pitiful Me”
the band left the stage except for
keyboard man Don Grolnick and
Ronstadt. Under a white spotlight,
Ronstadt attempted Dave Hartley
and Glenn Frey’s “Desperado.”
Her rendition was beautiful, but it
can’t hold a match to the Eagles‘
version.

The next song was Elvis
Presley’s “Love Me Tender,” Dan
Dougmore played a gentle harpsi-
chord throughout the tune.

Ronstadt had an innocent, shy
attitude in the face of wolf calls and
several ‘‘I love you, Linda” yells
from the crowd.

“Simple Man, Simple Dream”
was a slow, quiet song from her
new album; a handful of spectators
tried to disrupt it by yelling at the
stage. After ﬁnishing the lowkey

lively.
Ronstadt sung Neil
Young’s “Love is a Rose.” This
song showed off the band, with
handsome spiels on banjo and slide
guitar.

Ronstadt sang only from center
stage, and never took the micro-
phone from its stand. Her stage
manner was limited; the people on
the side and to the rear were
ignored. However, her voice was

\

ﬁne enough to transcend even a
poor view.

Grolnick, on piano, displayed his
high-quality wares during “It's So
Easy To Fall in Love." His
keyboard virtuosity was shown in
“Someone to Lay Down Beside
Me” and the Stones’ °‘Tumblin’
Dice."

After an hour of high-pitched
vocals Ronstadt went higher.

she boomed out the lyrics.

Winkler, Not Fonz, Is Hero Of ‘Heroes’

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

“Heroes”
Directed by Jeremy Paul Kasen

How's this for a movie pairing:
The Fonz meets the Flying Nun on
a cross-country bus trip, and goes to
California to start a worm farm?

Sound a bit out of kilter? On one
level, the newly released movie,
“Heroes,” currently at the Fulton
Theater, could be viewed warily
with this crazy theme.

 

 

" iv:-’ .
‘tr
. ~ ;

, M ._ .

Jack Dunn (Henry Winkler) makes a deal with a rabbit farmer (Harrison Ford)

Why? Well, the movie stars two
of television’s most identiﬁable
personalities, Henry Winkler (the
Fonz from the extremely popular
television series, “Happy Days")
and Sally Fields (who immortalized
sisters with wings in her television
hit, “The Flying Nun”). At ﬁrst,
the audience feels uncomfortable
with them outside of their familiar
roles.

However, this ﬁrst impression
melts from one’s mind quickly, for
both Fields and Winkler are

 

supply fertilizer for his worm farm. Winkler, in a wide contrast from his famous
television alter ego, Arthur Fonzerelli, portrays a disillusioned Vietnam veteran

in “Heroes."

  
  

excellent in this low-budget,
effective love story, carrying a
silent yet strong anti-war theme.

“Heroes” is warm, sensitive and
vivid in capturing the effect of a
Vietnam tour on Winkler’s Jack
Dunn, a man forced to ﬁght
because of the draft, who comes
home with deep mental and
physical scars.

Dunn is the misrepresented
stereotype of the returning Viet
Nam veteran—-off the wall and
unable to cope with American
society. He spends four years in a
veteran's hospital before ﬁnally
escaping with the money necessary
to start a worm farm in California.
The money for the farm is put up by
several of his platoon buddies,
many of whom are disabled,
paraplegic and unable to leave the
veteran’s hospital. ,

Dunn represents their only way
out. His journey and destiny is to
reach California, and start this
worm farm that will give him, and

his friends, something to live for._

Fields’ portrayal of the delicate
Carol is the confused girl in her mid
20’s traveling to New York to marry
a man she doesn’t love to become
the happy and humble housewife.

The pair meet in a bus terminal
where Dunn is dodging the military
police, who are trying to return him
to the hospital.

Eventually, through a series of
attention-grabbing antics——Dunn

takes a traveling weatherman’s
ventriloquist’s dummy, harasses
the bus driver, and climbs on the
windshield when dodging the police
detains him from boarding—the
two come together.

The ﬁlm roams with little or no
base, but this traveling across
America, picking up on slice of life
scenes, is done well.

What director Jeremy Paul
Kasen has done is blend this
blooming romance between the
somewhat irrational Jack and the
confused Carol with an anti-war
theme of forgotten heroes.

One of Dunn’s old partners and
fellow heroes is played by “Star
Wars” star Harrison Ford. Ford is
an old country boy from Missouri
who lives on his parents’ farm
raising rabbits that will eventually
supply the feces for the worms.

Ford’s way of releasing his
emotions is ﬁring at the stars with
his Army carbine and racing
around in his souped-up Camero.

Along with Ford, Jack and Carol
meet ‘up with several other
characters as they journey toward
California.

In a motel where they stay after
the frustrated Ford lends them his
car to continue their trek, they
meet up with grimy red necks in a
sleazy adjoining bar.

In a sensitive scene where Jack
can ’t handle the tenderness and joy

of staying a night with. the lovely
Carol (it is hinted because of his

war experience), he goes out for aifv ,'_r

to try and regroup his feelings. On
his walk, he gets mugged by the
local toughs and has all of his farm
fund money stolen.

The money is recovered when
Dunn threatens to smash the motel
manager who is in cahoots with the
toughs, and Carol crashes their
borrowed car through the bar to
save Jack from being done in by the
bar thugs.

This sort of scene might remind
one of a Burt Reynold’s movie such
as “White Lightning” and
“Smokey and the Bandit,” how-
ever “Heroes” has much more
substance and meaning.

Also effective in their brief
appearances in “Heroes” are
“Roots” star Olivia Cole, and
Stuart Margolin from television’s

“Rockford Files.”

But what makes the film
worthwhile are the sparkling
performances of Winkler and
Fields. Their characters are real,
and an audience can root for them
and their quest to ﬁnd themselves
on their own terms.

The disgruntled man and the
confused woman are old themes,
but “Heroes” is not cliche in its
dealings with the modern romance.

  Logan Reinstated Aft

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Junior Dave Logan, who quit the
Pitt football team by walking out
before practice Monday afternoon,
has been reinstateded following a
unanimous vote of the players at
their team meeting yesterday.
Logan probably will return to
practice next week to begin
preparation for Pitt’s big encounter
with Penn State Nov. 26.

The Pitt News learned yesterday
afternoon the team vote followed a
10-minute meeting between Logan
and Pitt defensive coordinator
Jimmy Johnson, in which Logan
“talked things out” with the
defensive coach.

Iogan stopped in at the locker
room in Pitt Stadium before
yesterday's practice to “pick up

some mail” and chat with
teammates. He left after his talk
with Johnson.

The 6-2, 240-pound nose guard
from Pittsburgh’s Peabody High
School walked out before Monday’s
practice at the stadium and wasn’t
seen until practice yesterday.

Sources say Logan, hampered all
season by two sprained ankles
(suffered in Pitt’s season opener
with Notre Dame) and a bad neck,
has become increasingly disen-
chanted since losing his starting job
to freshman Jerry Boyarsky several
weeks ago. ,

The situation came to a head last
week when Logan, deemed healthy
enough to practice after four
separate medical examinations,
refused to do so.

Given anultirnatum of if you don’t

practice,you don’t play, I.ogan
opted for the latter, and was
especially peeved when Boyarsky
got the starting call against West
Virginia Saturday.

Logan walked out Monday,

formally announced his decision to
quit the following day and wasn’t
seen ~ again until yesterday's
practice.

Linebacker, Al Chesley, I.ogan’s
closest friend on the team, said he

, expects Logan to return in time for

the Pitt-Penn State game. He also
denies reports Logan had an
attitude problem of some sort.
“The Pittsburgh papers. have
been reporting it wrong,” Chesley
said yesterday. “I hate to see them
print things like that. It's his
business, not theirs. People don’t
_ understand it hurts a player when
3 ‘you have an injury. You’re

have anything like that. He’s going
to be back. He’s just bitter that he's
not starting.”

One of Logan’s defensive team-
mates said Logan laughed when he
saw that his name tag and gear were
removed from his locker esterday.

“I asked him, ‘Hey, Déve, what
happened to your name tag?’ He
just laughed and said, ‘Hey man, I

_ don’t know.’

“Right then, I knew he would be
back, ’ ’ the teammate continued. “I
just had that feeling. He’ll be back
for Penn State. Watch and see,”

“ e injury was a disappointing
thing to him.” Pitt head coach
Jackie Sherrill said, “Every man
has his bad situations. Dave's
having his right now. Now, I think
he knows he has to work. There’s
more to this game than ability. And
I think Dave realizes that now.”

Poloists Seek Second Straight Eastern Cro wn

By Boa LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer-

The Pitt water polo team
encounters the second roadblock in
its quest for national recognition
this weekend, competing in the
Easter Championships at Trees
Pool.

As a result of their convincing
victory in the conference champion-
ships, the Panthers are the top
seed for the Easterns, and will be
favored to win the title for the
second straight year.

The round-robin tournament will
comprise seven teams (four from
the Mid-Atlantic Conference and
three from the Mid-East Con-
ference). Brown University, which
had ﬁrst declined to participate in
the Easterns, and then sought to be

'*'a late addition to the tournament,

has been denied admission.

Of the three teams from the
Mid-East Conference, Kentucky
and Cleveland State are the two
that could give Pitt the most
trouble. Kentucky has a reputation
for being an extremely physical
team, even more so than Pitt rival

Holloway Enjoys Slice Of Big Apple

Bucknell. Cleveland State is always
among the top ﬁnishers in NCAA
swimming, and uses its speed as a
major offensive threat. The third
team, Ohio State, was routed by
the Panthers in the Pitt Invita-
tional, 20-12.

Dave Diaz, supposedly out for
the year with a broken wrist, had
the cast removed Monday and will
be available for this weekend’s
tournament. Although he won’t be
in the starting lineup, Diaz will give
the Panthers added bench strength
as well as sprinter’s speed, which
could be valuable against a team
like Cleveland State.

Co-captain Mike Mere does not
accept the fact Pitt can be
physically intimidated by teams
like Bucknell and Kentucky.

“When teams get physical with
us we give it right back to them,”
Mere said. “We can play as dirty
as anyone, but we’ll wait until a
time when the referee isn’t looking
so we usually don’t get caught. If a
team gets in a couple of cheap
shots during the course of a match,

it just makes us want to beat them

Although Army might not be the most awesome
football team Pitt faces this year, the press luncheon
thrown by the West Pointers in New York City
receives Pitt’s Randy Holloway’s highest rating.

“They really treated us great up there,” said
Holloway, who along with teammates Matt
Cavanaugh and Hugh Green was chosen by coach
Jackie Sherrill to accompany him to meet the New
York media last Monday.

“They took us to Rusty Staub’s restaurant and he
cooked a great dinner for us, and there was always
something to do,” Holloway said. “We went to a bar
that was a hangout for some of the New York Giants
and a lot of professional agents. And there were a lot
of stewardesses there, too.”

But it was not all such carefree fun and games for
the 6-6, 235-pound all-American defensive tackle. He
was forced at the luncheon to field such highly
intelligent questions as, “Somenational publication
called you the ‘Ross Browner of the East’—how do
you feel about that?”

Holloway, not one given to answering stupid
questions in a similar manner, replied that while he
indeed felt Browner to be a fine football player, “I
would just rather be known as Randy Holloway.”

Some of the other topics the three Panthers were
queried about concerned the status of the Pitt team in
the national rankings and, of course, that November
madness, the post-season bowls. ’

What does the bowl picture look like for the
Panthers?

“We’re looking for a major bowl bid because we
feel we deserve one,” said Holloway. “We’re not
trying to be picky, but we’ve been unbeaten since the

season—and we think we ought to be in one of the
ma j or bowls.

“Nobody’s trying to put down the lesser bowls,”
he added, “but we’d like to have the honor of being
in a major bowl.”

The three major bowls are the Orange, which take
the winner of the Big Eight (probably Oklahoma)
and has its eyes on both Pitt and Penn State; the
Sugar, which takes the Southeastern winner
(Alabama), and the Cotton, with Southwestern

 

leader Texas—-currently the only undefeated major
college team and a legitimate number one in all
polls——and probably Notre Dame matching up there.

Since bowl invitations are issued, or at least can be
issued Nov. 19, one week before the Penn State
game, it has been mentioned by more than one Pitt
player they will be facing Arkansas in the Gator
Bowl.

‘‘I don’t know anything about the Gator,” said
Holloway, “but if we don’t get a major bowl, we’d
be happy to go to a smaller one like the Gator.”

It was suggested-—with the help of hindsight,

-{*3i,¢l1.i.§_.==11>vays -20-20 3.'!d..-3.*.lFI¢.f.9F¢. a bit

unfair—that perhaps the shifting of the Pitt—Penn
State game to Nov. 26 might not have been the best
move Pitt could have made. ‘

Holloway agreed. “I didn’t like that at all. For one
thing, I wanted to go home for Thanksgiving. And
I’m sure a lot of the students who don’t live around
Pittsburgh wanted to do the same-thing. Anyhow, I
think the game would have been televised even if it
hadn’t been moved.”

College football is the only major sport that does
not have a post-§eason championship playoff system.
College basketball and all pro sports have such
tourneys to determine who is number one by a means
much more equitable and satisfying than the polls.

‘‘I’d love to see that,” Holloway said. “Last year,
a few teams thought that they were better than us,
even after we killed‘Georgia. I would have liked to
give them all a shot at us. And playoffs would help a
team like us this year. We had some bad breaks at the
beginning of the season, but I think we’ve played as
well as anyone since then.

“And besides, the polls aren’t exactly fair because
writers have their favorites, both players and teams.”

What kind of year has 1977 been for the Pitt
football team?

“Since the past season is just about over, I’d have
to say we’ve done very well. We’ve had lots of young
guys in for us, and with that king of experience and
who we lost by graduation last year, it’s awfully hard
to repeat as l2-0. But I think we’ve had a real good
year. I’m happy with what the team’s done.”

And—Saturday, unfortunately for Army, the Big
Apple will get toﬁnd out just what Holloway and the
Panthers are still doing. ‘ e

Pitt News Staff Writer

Thinking about the pass is
something the‘ Pitt defensive
backﬁeld has been doing a lot of
this week, as it prepares to face
pass-crazy Army quarterback Lea-
mon Hall in tomorrow’s clash
between the Panthers and a tough
Army team in East Rutherford,
New Jersey.

Balzer Ready For Arm

With the feeling that whatever
success Pitt has tomorrow relies on
stopping Hall (who ranks among
the national leaders: in passing),
the Panthers have concentrated on
pass defense in this week's practice
sessions at Pitt Stadium.

“We’ve been practicing against
the pass a lot,” Pitt backup
defensive back Mike Balzer said

earlier this week. “We’ve been’

practicing against the ﬁrst team
offense, and they’ve been throwing
a lot of passes to get us ready.”

Even with the added emphasis
on pass defense, the Pitt secondary
is expected to have its hands full
with Hall, who has thrown as many
as 30 to 40 times in most of Army’s
games this year.

As his 57 percent completion
average attests, Hall not only loves

Panther F encers Debut

ByJIMLEWIS

For fencers like John Griffiths, a
tournament the size and impor-
tance of the University of Pitts-
burgh Open Tournament in the
Trees Hall multi-purpose room
tonight (5:30) and tomorrow (9:30)
is the first, and perhaps only,
chance to any form of competion.

“It’s a new experience for most
of us,” Grifﬁths said. “It’s a thrill
for all of us and it’s a really nice
thing to compete in sports.”

The tournament, organized by
fencing instructor Stella Saurer,is
the ﬁrst ever hosted in a Pitt facility
in over four years and will feature
seven teams—two from Ohio State,
two -from West Virginia, two from
Saurer’s private Pleasant Hills
club, and one host Panther squad.
The opposition will be tough, but

’ Grifﬁths isn’t worried.

“I’m conﬁdent of my own

ability,” he said, “and I think all
the others feel the same way about
their ability.”

The others who will participate
from the Pitt team are Carolyn
Fenner, Bobbi Eggleston, Scott
Fadzen, Fernando Salazar, Mike
.Mandell, Ron Broadhead, Ray
Intriere, Matt Thorpe, Bill Johnson
and Bob Melder.

“They're so good, I don't know
who to choose for the ‘A’ team,”
Saurer claimed. “I’m surprised
how wonderful they were. I
emphasize technique and style and
thought they were doing really
well.”

Technique and style are impor-
tant to Saurer, who has competed
in fencing forpover 40 years.

“Fencing is such an individual
sport that you can express your
personality in it,” she said. “It’s
like talking; everyone knows how to
talk, but others speak well.”

Grifﬁths echoed his instructor’s
beliefs.

“The style in fencing is a matter
of personality,” he agreed. “It’s
excellent for character and dis-
Cipline—you just can get angry
during competition or you can rip
up someone with the sharp steel
blades.” ‘

“In England, fencing is a regular
school sport,” he continued. “The
English compete in fencing in the
Olymipcs, and so it’s a big national
sport over there. I hope fencing
lclan develop here as well as soccer

as.

But that may not be; due to lack
of funds, the University may not be
able to keep fencing classes
going—dooming the sport as a
campus activity.

“It’s shameful,” Grifﬁth-s said,
“because there’s a lot of student
interest and it’s important in
learning discipline, technique and
is good as exercise and for
developing character.”

to throw the football. he also likes
to complete his passes.

“Hall’s a good quarterback,”
said Pitt defensive backﬁeld coach
Larry Holton. “There’s no doubt
about that. Look for our secondary
to get some kind of workout this
week. He’ll be throwing that
football.”

If the Army quarterback throws
as much as Holton thinks he’ll
throw, Balzer could see plenty of
action. He will be the one to step in
should any of the Panthers’
starting defensive backs get tired
out from the aerial bombardment
anticipated from Hall.

That’s the reason Balzer is
paying extra close attention to Hall.

“He’s a good quarterback,”
Balzer said. “We’re hoping we can
get a good pass rush. If we can get
the good pass rush, he’ll have to
throw the ball real quick, and he

y Air Corps

probably won’t complete as many
passes.

3 “He doesn’t put that much zip
on his throws.” Balzer continued.
“But l;e’s still pretty accurate. He
likes the short stuff. He goes with
the quick patterns like the out, the
ﬂat, and the flag patterns. He just
picks you apart.

“But if the linebackers get good
drops on their pass coverage and
we get a good rush up front, we
shouldn’t have any trouble stop-
ping him,” Balzer said.

With top Cadet running back

Larry King (817 yards) hampered‘:

by a pulled hamstring muscl‘
suffered in the Cadet’s 31-6 win
over Air Force last week, Hall is
expected to go to the air even more.

If that’s the situation, Mike
Balzer and the rest of the Pitt
defensive backﬁeld will have to do
more than just think about the
pass.

Booters conclude Season
With Loss to Indiana, 2-0

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt’s soccer team couldn't
handle West Penn Conference
champion Indiana (Pa.), as the
Indians shut out the Panthers, 2-0,
on a wet and muddy ﬁeld Tuesday
at Indiana. This loss lowered the
ﬁnal Pitt record to .500 at 7-7-1.

The Indians ﬁrst goal by John
Bouman at 17:30 was an almost
impossible shot, while the second
by Tom Haney at 66:27 was a

Newell Accepts Responsibility o

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The goalie position is probably
the least glamourus role in hockey.
There is not only the physical strain
of being conﬁned to the cage and
staying in a hunched position, but
the added pressure and responsi-
bility of stopping the opponent’s
puck.

Larry Newell, who has started at
goal for the Pitt Hockey Club for
the past two years, is deﬁnitely
aware of his responsibility to the
team. Sidelined by compound
fractures in his big toe for the
season opener against Bowling
Green, Newell still was ready to go
in for Rich Cunningham if the
situation arose.

“I could’ve been ready to play if
Rich was hurt,” Newell said, “but I
was really in too much pain.”

With the addition of Cunning-
ham to strengthen the netminding
corps, Newell feels that this year,
Pitt’s season outlook “looks great.
We have three good lines and six
excellent defensemen.

“During the past two years, our
wins have at least doubled our
losses,” he added. “It looks good
this year. We have more depth.”

Even his injury—he caught a
shot in practice that broke the shell
of his skate.—-doesn’t bother Newell
too much.

“Our trainer, Bobby Osbourne,
is building me a pad like a cast I
can wear inside my skate,” he said.
“This isn’t as bad as last year. I
was out for a couple weeks with a
fractured ankle I got during the
New York trip. This is just minor
compared to that.

When Newell returns to the

lineup Sunday against Virginia at
the Civic Arena, Pitt will have the
two tallest goalies in the east—both
Newell and Cunninghan are over
six feet. Although most hockey
buffs think a tall goalie is at a
disadvantage, Newell disagrees.

“I guess we're the biggest
goaltenders, not only in the
Eastern Conference, but anywhere
around," he said. “But, if
anything, my height and weight
help me cover more area.”

Not only can Newell cover more
area, he can defend it—sometimes
more violently than he intends to.

“Last year, I started four games
in a row, and didn’t ﬁnish any of
them because of ﬁghts,” he said.

“I feel Itake it upon myself, if
someone’s bothering me in the
goal, it’s my responsibility. There’s
no excuse-—if a goal goes in it’s my
fault,” Newell explained.

-.x.-.- r ~ . - . --

\'.'

~-r.-I! . - : ' s - x q , A

Last year, Newell permitted four
goals per game, as opposed to his
3.2 average during his freshman
year.-

“It’s going to be lower this year,
but again, that depends some on
our defense,” he said.

The average may not be
impressive, but apparently, some
professional teams feel that Newell
is. Last season, he was approached
by an agent from the Cleveland
Barons, but declined the offer.

“They're going to be a folding
franchise, anyway,” he observed.
“I’m looking for another shot, but
preferably not until I’m a senior.
I’m pretty happy with my studies.”

Newell also received an offer
from the Penguin’s farm club in
Hershey, but turned it down. “I
want to get my degree and go from
there.”

A junior with career aspirations
in speech pathology, Newell
originally intended to go to college
in Wisconsin. Then he was drafted
by a team in Sault Ste. Marie,
where he played in the Canadian
leagues (often opposing Cunning-
ham). But Newell was unhappy in
Canada, and decided to come to
Pitt.

In the Pitt Hockey Club, Newell
was paired again with Curt Hetz,
his teammate at Shaler high school.
Newell had played against other
Pitt teammates in high school, and
was” familiar with their tendencies.
The cohesion between the Pitt
players made for winning seasons in
1976 and 1977. This year is
expected to be their best yet,
despite the teams’s current 0-l
standing.

Newell will return to practice
today, and may start against
Virginia (game time is 6:30 p.m.).
ﬁle may not be ready physically,’-

ut mentally, Newell is ready to
play.

“letter perfect” head shot from the
corner. ‘

“We presseed them in the
second half, but did everything but
put the ball in the goal,” said Pitt
coach Leo Bemis. “Both goalies
made some great saves and played
exceptional games.

This loss in the ﬁnal game of the
season, followed a great 3-2 win at
West Virginia on Saturday. Craig
Connolly led the Panthers, scoring
all three goals to lead Pitt to its ﬁrst
victory over the Mountaineers" in
seven years.

“One of our goals this season
was to beat West Virginia and we
accomplished it,” said Bemis.

“Connolly played a great game?‘

The Mountaineers took a 1-0 lead
when Eric Johke scored at 21:00,
but 30 seconds later Connolly
brought the Panthers back to a 1-1
tie with his ﬁrst goal. Pitt took a
lead it never relinquished three and
a half minutes into the second half
on Connolly’s second goal. With
Pitt leading 3-1, Paul Plemish
scored the ﬁnal goal of the game
for the Mountaineers with 12
minutes remaining.

Connolly ﬁnished the season as
Pitt’s leading scorer with 12 goals,
more than the entire Panther team
scored last season. John O’Hara
was second with seven goals, and
Marty Moyer followed with "-
tallies. The Panther team outsco ed

its opponents 43-25, and its seven '

wins in the season, 38-3.

In summing up the season,
Bemis said, “The upperclassmen
came through with the offensive
punch that we didn’t have last
year. We played a more balanced
game and weren’t constantly in a
defensive posture like last year.”

When asked about the future,
Bemis explained, “We’re a very
young team. We had only one
senior starter and one se i0:

substitute while we regularly}\'

started at least two freshmen. I
think we can look forward to more
success next year.”

Last season, the Panthers scored
a total of 10 goals in 13 games,
while compiling a record of 4-7-2.
This season, Pitt went 7-7-1 and
scored 43 goals. If the Panthers
continue to improve as they did
over the past two seasons, success
may be an understatement.

Joe Greene-less

PI'I'I'SBURGH (AP)-Pittsburgh
Steeler tackle Joe Greene, who said
a mouthful last week, responded
with a few words on paper
Thursday after he was ﬁned $1,000
for criticizing National Football
League ofﬁcials.

The Steelers announced that he
had been ﬁned. The Associated
Press learned‘ the amount was
$1,000.

Greene’s comments Thursday
came only by a press release
passed out by a Steeler spokesman
as the 280-pound tackle sat
sheepishly ‘mute in front of a few
reporters.
said about referees: “If I get half a
chance, I’ll punch one of them out.

“I wish a bolt of lightning
would come down and strike one of
their hearts out.

“I’ll call them the dirtiest name I
can think of. I’ll talk about their
momma.”

Greene met with National
Football League Commissioner
Pete Rozelle in New York for about
15 minutes on Monday after
Rozelle called him there to discuss
his remarks.

Greene’s prepared remarks
Thursday:

“I explained to Mr. Rozelle that I
said what I said was for effect. I
wanted to call attention to the

problem that I think exists
regarding ofﬁcials. Iwas upset and

frustrated. In the future I will

Pantherette Harriers
Finish Eleventh in East

By ANGELA VAVITHES

In the Eastern Championships in
women’s eross eeuntry, held‘ at
Rutgers University in New Bruns-
wick, New Jersey, Pitt placed 11th
in a field of 25 schools.

Pitt’s runners placed well in the
meet: Becky Falck was 37th,
Brenda Chorpenning placed 46th,
and Diane Miller, Maria Sciullo and
Jenny Westman were 70th, 93rd
and 106th. Teams from 25 schools
competed with individuals from an
additional 10 schools; the’ total
number of runners was approxi-
mately 170.

The Panthers were at a dis-
advantage because three of their
steady runners were unable to
compete. Therese Walton has been
out of competition for about 6 weeks
with a fractured leg, and the team

lost Diane Weigel last week to
tonsillitis. Both Walton and Weigel
are freshman, and had good
seasons before they were injured.
Sophomore Kathy Paczkowski left
the team about a month ago because
of obligations to the basketball
team. Sciullo said she feels the
absences hurt Pitt to such a degree
that, if they had run on Saturday,
the team would have placed in the
top five.

Eastern championships send
their first three teams and top nine
runners to the National Champion-
ships. Penn State and Maryland

placed first and second in the meet.

However, the third spot was open
because neither Massachusetts
third or Rutgers fourth had
sufficient funds to go, so the bid
went to fifth place Middletown.

University Travel Service has begun using an advanced, automated reservations system
that was specially designed to serve the public faster and handle the complex details of their
business more efficiently.

The system, known as Sabre II, enables University Travel Service to give its customers
immediate confirmation for flights operated by about 500 airlines worldwide. The flights serve
some 4500 individual cities and about 65,000 city pairs.

with Sabre II, University Travel Service sales personnel no longer work at conventional
desks. Instead, they are now seated, airline fashion, at Sabre ll reservations sets that use
video screens and typewriter-like keyboards linked directly to a main computer center.

This way worldwide travel information, including hotel accommodations and rental cars,
is at University Travel Service fingertips the instant a customer calls with a request or an
inquiry.

Sabre II provides University Travel Service with an immediate display of flights and seat
availability for the desired departure-time. The display includes all flights around the specified
hour. During peak periods the more satisfactory closed flights are also displayed to make sure
every possibility for the desired hour is explored.

As with airline space, the hotel and car-rental features are on a global basis. The system
also provides fare quotations, foreign currency conversions and a number of other service
activities aimed at customer convenience and satisfaction.

In addition, University Travel Service has added to the basic system additional automated
equipment to print tickets. The front copy of this ticket will be used as a bill-stamped
“lNVOICE” with UTS and address in red. So each passenger will have a direct copy of his
actual ticket when billed personally.

We are most anxious to accommodate our clientele with the utmost in service and
equipment. Why not stop by to see Sabre II in action. Our staff will be pleased to demonstrate
Sabre II, and to invite your comments on this, as well as other ways you feel we can continue
to improve our services to you.
