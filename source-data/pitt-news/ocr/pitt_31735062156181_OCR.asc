Open to Speakers

By HARRIET PINCUS

“Frolm those who have—for those who haven’t .1.”
This is the idea that will be presented to each Pitt un-

dergraduateby 150 classroom solicitors for the Pitt Chest . '

next Monday and Tuesday.

Paul Schrading, general chairman, has announced that
fourth hour Monday _and third hour Tuesday will be- given
over to Pitt Chest classroom solicitations throughout the
undergraduate school. The aim, asin last year’s campaign,
is “Two dollars from all Pitt scholars.” The dent and phar-
macy schools have already pledged to donate two dollars

per student fromitheir funds for material breakage, toward ‘_ -

the Chest goal of $8000.

The’ Graduate Schools of Public Health and Law are
completing their Chest campaigns today, while the medical
school and other graduate schools will solicit next ~week

along with the undergrads.

The Varsity Marching Band, under the direction of
-ert L. Arthur, is giving its cooperation to the campaign by

Bob-

centering its Saturday half-time show around the theme of
the Pitt Chest. Various dance numbers portraying “A Bene-
ﬁt Dance forthe Pitt Chest” will serve to. remind students

of the coming‘ solicitations."

Publicity co-chairmen Doris Hart and Rosemarie Feil
have placed a large,“thermometer” at the Student Deskto.

Bid Means Black Budget

‘ Miami Game Means
$100,000 Take
By BORIS WEINSTEIN
A guarantee of $100,000

"from" the Orange‘ Bowl would
" deﬁnitely put this year’s foot-

ban ledger in the black.

Pitt has been operating
without a proﬁt this year and
according to Frank Carver, ath-

letic publicity director, will con-it

tinue to do so.
An ,Orange Bowl offer, .how—

. ever, would erase any deﬁcit that

might occur during Pitt’s last ‘two
games. Van C. Kusserow, member

andrpast president of the Orange
_ Bowl‘ Committee, » informed the

News that Pitt is deﬁnitely being
considered for" the Orange Bowl.
Tight Budget _

He also revealed that the 1953
will be guarante_ed
$100,000 from gate, radio and
television rights.

“We’ll "have, "to think ‘many
times before turning down a bowl
offer like that one,” Carver said.
"As it is, we are handicapped by
a tight budget this year and it’s
tough‘ to go through a ' season

Vbucking that obstacle and draw-

ing only fair crowds.”

According to William Crough,
sales, service manager of QZVDTV,
"only the Orange and Rose Bowls

haveioﬁered their games for tele-
,vision in the eastern section of

the country.” Pitt, therefore,
would beneﬁt by an added sec-
tional appeal plus local interest.
Could Exceed 100,000

Its take, then, from television

and radio, plus a" bowl that can

A -‘ handle approximately 65,000 spec-

tators coiild net them more than

'.the guaranteed $100,000.

As yet,Pitt oﬂicials have not re-
ceived any bid» from the Orange,
Sugar, or Cotton Bowl commit-‘

 tees. A The‘ Panthers, though,‘ are

State Shows Gain
From Early Form
By RUSS ‘FRANKE
, In view of the recent strong
showing made by North Caro-
lina S State," Red Dawson’s
Panthersare in for a tougher
battle than expected‘ when
the Wolfpack ,- invades the
Stadium for the ﬁrst time in his-
tory tomorrow.

Apparently local fans are taking
the visitors more lightly, since a
slim crowd of only 15,000 is ex-
pected to watch Pitt go after its
sixth victory of the season against
a team with a 3-4 record.

But Dawson, fearful ofa let-
down such as led the West Virginia
upset, points cautiously to the
power the Wolfpack has gained
through the use of freshmen and
sophomores who have naturally
improved since the start of the sea-
son. I _ ‘

,, Bowl Talk Bad -.

Another gremlin Dawson has to
put down is the bowl fever which
cropped up on campus following
the Ohiogstate triumph. The red-
head warned that such a thing
could easily wreck. a good team.

However, all things point to an-
other win for the roaring Panthers
now that they are back in their
scoring stride of at_least 20 points
per ‘game. ' Once again, _the team
willbe at full strength, having in-
curred no serious injuries in Co-

Approximately‘ 15 persons have
signed up to run. Among them are
Professor‘ Robert X. Graham of the

Running is required to the 18th

may take an elevator to reach their
goal. ,

“Circulation of the Owl has been
poor so far,” business manager
Karl »Meyers stated today. Only
500 yearbooks '3 have been sold to

date and Meyers attributed it to a ,

“drop in senior. enrollment and the
fact that the price of printing.ap-
proximately ‘1800 Owls has risen
$1000 over last year’s cost.”

“The price of the Owl has risen‘

in the past twelve years, but so
has the price of everything else.”

In 1939 the yearbook cost $5 and

it is $6 today.

’ Actual cost of printing an Owl '

is over $10 and the $4 deﬁcit on
each yearbook is made up mainly

through advertisements, Meyers.

In the last few weeks, I have
noticed an extremely poor atti-
tude brewing concerning school
spirit. It has now reached its"
ugly climax in an unprecedent-
ed, unfounded and vile attack
upon Jay Garber, our Pitt Pan-

the nemesis of Mr. D. A.—Ron
Ecker. Ecker at times spoke with
more speed than clarity, but in
his slower moments delivered a

9vigorous defense of Garber and

assailed as -“utterly ridiculous”
Adler’s drive to oust Garber.

business had been disposed.
Adler moved‘ that Congress ask
for Garber’s resignation. ’Then
Adler began the attack. 

Adler Doesn't Gamble
Garber had »made too many
mistakes in‘ past rallies, Adler
charged. “I’m' not ‘a gambling
man,” Adler continued, “I’m not
willing to «gamble with future

pep rallies.” He further declar‘-'

ed that’it was about time «“to
quit passing out political pa-
tronage and to get interested
people” to dorthe necessary work.

Then followed a brief cross-
examination period. Adler and

his cohorts ‘wrung from Garber

Progress or Patronage

‘ By, DAVE GREEN ..

Men’s Council will -have a chance next Tuesday
tovrefute the opinion that it’s just a haven for poli-
'tic'al glad handers, but most facts ‘indicate that

progress will be sacriﬁced for political patronage.
. ‘When"Harry Dougherty resigned from MC re-
cently, the boy legislators were faced with the ,
‘problem of electing somebody in his place. No
. real diﬁiciilty was anticipated by. -

counselors, was

ungrateful barrage upon one
man, capable Jay Garber.

I am a transferee from the
University of North Carolina, a
senior" who felt that Pitt, ,at—
tempting to act like a member

of the Big Ten, would have

school spirit to match. its big

ambition. Iknow what it is like‘

to go to a school in which one
year you are on top and the
next, the bottom. Our, school
spirit never fell when we were
in the dumps; so if ours didn’t
why should Pitt who has‘ a good
winning team? Well I tell you,
it shouldn’t! .

If Mr. Adler and his cohorts
want to know who is responsible

' for the faux pas of the Ohio

ceived, developed and administered by him. He
currently is handling the orientation of speakers
for the Pitt Chest. A glance at his record in the
Dean’s oﬁice proves without a shadow of a doubt
that he’s got a lot on the ball. ' ” ‘

If electing th_e‘best> man for the job were the
only issue before MC, Joe‘ 'I‘rattner’s getting the
post "would be as certain as sunrise, but ever
since Joe _ﬁrst donned his dink, the cry among the
loyal leftovers of the Wecht machine has been,
“Cut Joe Trattner’.” . H

And he has been out. Last year, as'a represen-
tative of Freshman Council, he was thrown out of
Men’s Council meetings ona technical point brought
up by Ronnie Ecker. His name, after being mys-
teriously crossed off the list "of potential upperclass

ence of MC vice president Mort Goldstein. After be-
ing temporarily stopped from speaking for the Pitt
Chest last. year by a previously unheard of rule,
not permitting freshmen to speak, he ended up
soliciting funds from the elevator engine room in
th_ eupper reaches of the Cathedral. A

Reese, Berger, and others said
that they had. not been asked.
Adler said that he would have
been “tickled pink” to emcee the’: "

“possibly because I wasn’t' a close
friend of J ay’s.” ~.

Now it was the Defense’s turn.‘ V

no other place to go.  "

While the press scribbled, and 1

In 05 U Demonstration

Pitt students have been labeled “rowdy” by the

down-

' town newspapers‘ in connection with their display in tear-
ing down Ohio State’s goal posts after Pitt’s win last week.

After the game, a group of allegedly drunken Pitt stu-
dents crowded onto the ﬁeld ande’ .

made a run ‘for the $1000 goal‘

posts, which were of— all metal and
sunk into ﬁve feet of cement.

Students climbed to the top and
began to swing on the posts, and
as they were met by little resist-
ance from OSU students, they suc-

‘fceeded in bending the posts to the
ground and snapping them. They
never got them out of the cement.

ROTC Fails

An honor guard of ROTC at-
tempted to halt the wreckage of
theposts on the other end of the
football ﬁeld. Fights ensued and
several of the ROTC men lost their
helmets. The military students
marched off and the otherposts

. fell\before Pitt’s engrossed stu-
dents.

In a statement to The Pitt News,
Dean of Men Theodore Biddle

‘commented as follows upon the
7 ‘situation:

“We are disturbed by the re-
ports that connect students and
followers of Pitt with the destruc-
tion of property and other miscon-
duct at the Ohio State game in
Columbus. _

“Mutual Conﬁdence”

“Good relations betweeninstitu-
tions such as Pitt and Ohio State

_'are based upon mutual conﬁdence
that the schools concerned respect
certain high ideals and that the
students and followers of their
teams have an appreciation of
these ideals.’

“I know that these ideals are ad-‘

hered to by the majority of our
student body. We certainly hope
that all may adhere to them in the
future so that we will not ‘ in-be
subject to this kind of ci-i‘ticism.”

In IC4A’s

By DAVE MAZER

Six Panther .harriers travel
to New York ‘Monday to com-
pete in the 44th renewal of
the‘IC4A cross country cham-

ionships.

Headed by Captain Bernie Lu;
terancik, the group includes Dick

gWeber, Dan Sommer, Don Delli

.Gatti, Alan Gunderson, and Chuck.

Fritz.

«‘ The Blue-and-Gold’s only con- -

querors, Syracuse and Army, are

' ~- among the expected 45 entries and

the Panthers will be looking for-

_wa1;d to avenging their previous

defeat.
Placed Seventh

Favored team in, the match is
Penn State, the“ IC4A champion
the past two years. They were
undefeated in dual meet competi-
tionthis season.

The Panther harriers, however,
have been practicing for the ﬁve-
mile Van Courtland Park course,
"hoping to _improve over their last
visit to New York.

Coach Carl Olson’s runners ﬁn-
ished seventh in last year’s meet
with Frank Kuzma placing 25th
for top Pitt honors. ‘

NCAA Next

Although the Pant-hers are con-
sidered stronger than they were
last year, Olson notes that “the

SENIOR PIVOTMEN—Stu
Kline (left) of Westmont and
Gabe Gembarlosky of Donora
will again share the offensive
center duties tomorrow as ‘ the
Panthers seek their sixth win of

other teams have improved, too,
and I’ll be quite happy if we can
break into the top ﬂve.”
Following this meet, the Pan-
,thers return home to prepare for
‘the NCAA championships which
take place at East Lansing, Mich-

igan next Monday.

Cubs in Home Debut

By CARROLL ooox

Pitt’s undefeated freshmen meet Bullis Prep tomorrow
morning at 10:30 at the Stadium in their only home game

of the season.

The game, however, will be moved to Ellsworth Field
if badeweather necessitates removing the heavy covering off
the Stadium turf before the varsity game in the afternoon.

Tomorrow’s game is theﬁnal one of the season for the

Cubs who have already whippedi

the Army and Navy Plebes.

Line Holds Key

Although the Cubs hope to go
undefeated for the second time in
three years, Bullis Prep, conquer-
ors of Columbian Prep, Wyoming
Seminary and VMI frosh, have
plans of derailing the Blue-and-
Gold.

A Pitt line, which has yet to
yield a point in the second half,
is the key to Pitt’s hopes for vic-
tory tomorrow. ~

Kiesel To Start

On the oﬁense, the frosh rely
on the passing arm of Al Yanc-
wich and John Sebest for its scor-
ing. Handy Al has hurled two
touchdown passes, "both to Sebest,
who also has thrown two TD
passes himself—-both to End John

ple—and—Blue have compiled a 10-1
record thus far. .
Air and Land Attack

Flashing a powerful offensive
punch with lightning ground plays
and a withering airborne assault,
the Delts completely smothered the
Sigs. ' The Cliﬁ Hargest-Artie Mc-
Curley combo showed the aerial
way while Leo Kairys, Fritzie
Zivic and Dick Swanson bucked
out ground yardage.

Sigma Chi’s ace passer, Bud‘
Spangler, was stopped continually
throughout the tilt by the hard
rushing of Bud Atkinson and
Kairys. His running, however, was
the attack threat the-Delts found

  Rex \l’eery , Hopes
To Revive Crowds  

By BORIS WEIN STEIN
Sports Editor

  
  
   

   

Grappling and grumbling antics are the original fakeroos
of professional wrestling—male and female. The college va-
riety, on the other hand, lacks the grappling and grumbling,
but, unfortunately, trails a Weak second to the audiences
the, pros attract.

‘‘ Rex.Peery has the patience and ‘optimism, though, to
“plug the sports until the mobs rise up in mass and acclaim
college wrestling. When the ex-
national champ left Oklahoma
four years ago he also left behind
screaming college mat crowds who
weakly turned out to untie the
holds their favorite schoolboy
wrestlers got into.

Not many miles from here,
they create a similar amount of
excitement at Penn State, Waynes-
burg and Lehigh.- But how does
the mat tug-of-war shape up 10-
cally? '

Earlier this Week Peery,
with an eye to his sweat-
shirted proteges racing around
the basketball ﬂoor, approach-
the ‘problem from two fronts
——optimistically and doubtful-
1y.

i “Most of the people who came
out last year to see them perform were satisﬁed,” Peery recalled.

"‘Of course, a few basketball fans rejected the sport because it meant

that they «had to come early to get seats for the basketball game.”
The fact remains that while the wrestlers and cagers played on
the same bill the Field House was never sold out. So apparently the

_ grumblers enjoyed the grapplers.

This winter, however, the matmen must operate on their
own hook. Due to scheduling difﬁculties, the athletic department
was unable to arrange wrestling-basketball doubleheaders. The
idea,‘ by the way, was an original one. —

Frank Carver, athletic publicity director, stamped the project
successful and regrettedthat a similar schedule couldn’t be worked
out. _

So Peery must begin at home once again to zfurther improve
his audiences. The last time he took his work home he developed a
world contender, Hugh, and a state champ, Ed.
