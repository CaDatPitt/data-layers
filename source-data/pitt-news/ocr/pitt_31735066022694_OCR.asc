Liquor Board Chairman Opposes Funding Governor's Deficit

By SETH H; LUBOVE ’
Pitt News Staff Writer

A The chairman of the Liquor Con-

trol Board is not very happy with
Gov. Richard Thornburgh’s request
to’ raise $26 million this year
through’ increased liquor prices to
raise money to fund Pitt and other
state related institutions. Y

“I don’t think it’s our business to
be on any appropriations,” said
Daniel Pennick, head of the three
member independent state agency
in a telephone interview.

“The liquor board is an agency,
and we give whatever funds (we
receive) over into the general fund

NewOpen PartyAnd Rush Rules To Reduce Local Complaints L’

By SETH H. LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer
The beer will not be ﬂowing in

large quantities anymore this fall ‘

for Pitt’s 22 fraternities as new

‘open party and rush regulations

take effect, limiting a. total of one
open party per term for each frater-
nity and a limit of two weeks open
rush.

The new rules, voted on and pass-
ed by the Interfraternity Council in
April, are the result of plans to
resolve neighborhood and com-'
munity problems the fraternities
had encountered and to cut down
on some of the property damage
caused by outsiders during the large
parties.

Louis McLinden, fraternity ad-
viser in the Office of Student Ac-
tivities, said the neighborhood com-
plaints may have caused enactment
of the new rules, but he “doubts
it.”

“I would look at it as why should
the fraternity system be the only

priorities lie with the consumers.

Thornburgh requested a lO-_cent- .

per-bottle increase or handling

a budget deficit. The deficit would
have forced a ten percent across-

the General Assembly had set aside
for the state-related institutions.

social programming committee for
parties on this campus? Their
houses were not built to handle
those huge numbers of people,”
McLinden said.

According to a letter sent to all of
the fraternities’ national offices and
signed by Don Parella, president of
IFC, “rush will open the first two
weeks in September with open
advertising. The next" two weeks,
Rush will be by invitation only, and
to insure this policy, a “no advertis-
ing” regulation has been adopted.
This should reduce party numbers
and size and will lessen neighbor

-complaints. . .

“Lately, it has been a practice
here for fraternities to throw all-
campus parties weekly. This policy
has caused neighbor complaints
about large groups destroying pro-
perty after leaving our parties. In
addition, some houses have been
damaged by outsiders during these
parties. To diminish these problems
and to urtiji the fraternity system, a

Office of Residence Life will be in-
creasing their staff with the addi-
tion of two professional staff
members who will reside on campus
in University housing.“ These new
staff members, in the newly created
position of “area coordinator” will
be between the ranking of a resident
director and below the two assistant
directors of the Office of Residence
Life.

According to Tim Synder, one of
the two assistant directors of
residence life under Jo Ann Wood-
son, the area coordinators will
share “primarily central office
responsibilities in terms of over-
sight.’.’ It will be “on hand kind of
stuff,” Snyder said, in terms of

our back?”

In addition to Pitt, Penn State,
Temple, Lincoln, and the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania would be af-
fected by the slash, which Thorn-
burgh said he would not put into ef-
fect until October 1. Thornburgh is
hoping that the LCB‘ and the
Legislature would approve the in-
creases by then.

But Pennick is sticking firm to his -

position on liquor price increases
and lower discounts.

“It’s not right, because this is the
first time anybody. said to the LCB,
‘Hey, you have to come up with X
amount of dollar,’ and then it’s ap-

propriated for the universities or
any institutions. That’s up to them
(the legislature) to make,’-’ Pennick
said.

"‘I’m looking at it as a marketing
man. We’re in the business of sell-
ing this product,” Pennick added.

According to Dennis McManus
of Pitt’s Office of Governmental
Relations, the possible appropria-
tions slash is not necesssarily going
to depend on”revenues from the
LCB.

“Let’s say it’s contingent on get-
ting additional revenues,”
McManus said, but “the governor
would still like to get some of the in-

crease from the LCB, and I think at
this time he is planning on eventual-
ly seeing that happen. But, on July
21, 1980, it doesn’t look like that is
going to happen too soon.”
According to McManus, the fact
that appropriations are reliant on

the LCB this year is not unique, but ,

‘that situations like this will emerge
during any revenue shortfall.

“In any year where there's a
revenue shortfall or anticipated
shortfall in revenues, we’re depen-
dent on various sources,”
McManus said. “Some years it
might be the. income tax, other

Arsenal Pre-school To Remain Open
Future After Fall Remains Doubtful

By NOLA WERNER
Pitt News Staff Writer‘

The Arsenal Family and_
Children’s Center received $100,000
from the University yesterday to
keep the preschool open until the

end of the fall term.

Edison Montgomery, vice
chancellor for health sciences
allocated the state -. appropriated
funds ‘to help the financially strap-
ped institution remain open.

The decision was made during a
meeting between, Montgomery,
Anne Pascasio, dean of health
related professions, Sara Arnaud,
director of Arsenal, and a “steering
committee” of Arsenal parents.

limit of one all-campus party per
term has been adopted.”

McLinden said the fraternities
“only lost money on the large par-
ties,” because of the non-fraternity
students and non-students attend-
ing the parties “having "none of the
responsibility and not taking care of
the house.”

Damages to fraternity houses in-
cluded broken windows, spilled
beer, and the theft of valuable
stereo and recording equipment. ‘

“It just doesn’t pay the frater-
nities to be the only social group on
campus,” McLinden said.

Administration reaction to the
new rules has ben favorable, with
Senior Vice Chancellor Jack
Freeman calling the actions of IFC
“very sensible,” and. a “very
mature approach to the problem.” .

“I think the whole thing is just
very constructive and quite respon-
sible,” Freeman said, “and I'm
quite pleased with it. That kind of
self-governance and self-discipline I

with the resident assistants.

“I kind of see them in the role of
taking care of some issues that need
to be taken care of, the issues that

according to Montgomery.
ever, he added, “Pitt is out of the
business when the school closes for
the Christmas holidays.”

According to Arnaud, a Pitt
psychology professor who will con-
tinue as the director of Arsenal, the
state has appropriated $100,000 to
the Arsenal preschool for the past
six years without any increase for
inﬂation. , " Q

The Arsenal Center-is a preschool
for toddlers and three-to-four-year-
olds which is used by Pitt as a train-
ing ground for undergraduate and
(graduate students studying child

think is far preferable to the univer-
sity trying to impose restrictions on
fraternities.

“I have always maintained that
the fraternities should be primarily
self-governing. That is, they need to
know what their responsibilities
are, and set rules to meet those
responsibilities,” Freeman added.

In addition, Parella had mention-
ed in the letter to the national of-
ﬁces that the proposed university
housing project .“seems to’ be the
ultimate solution to many of our
problems.”

(There is a proposal to build be-
tween four and eight fraternity
houses on Pitt-owned land at Alle-
quippa and University Drives, _but
ﬁnancial problems of the frater-
nities are holding up any construc-
tion projects. Negotiations are in
progress between the individual
fraternity advisers and the-univer-
sity.) ,

McLinden said the housing pro-.
ject would solve some of the frater-

ing to anticipate problems but was
so busy “solving and dealing” with
problems that already exist, they
would have a hard time anticipating

“The bottom line will be that this
will free the resident directors to
spend a little bit more time doing
what they’re really there to do,”
which Snyder cited as “personal in-
teraction with the resident
assistants.”

Most people would agree that the
motives behind the creation of new
staff positions are reasonable,
especially Jo Ann Woodson who
was responsible for the hiring, but
others might disagree about where

development. ,

The preschool has been maintain-
ed for the pastfour years with the
help of supplementary funds from
private foundations, according to
Carolyn Lederman, a parent with
three children at Arsenal and a
member of the “steering commit-
tee.” '

However, “the supplementary

funds from private foundations _.

were finished as of July 1,” accor-
ding to Arnaud.

Lederman said, “Pitt has
estimated it will cost them an extra
$75,000 this year and that is why
they ‘are pulling out of Arsenal.”

nities’ problems because local
residents -wouldn’t have to have
fraternities as neighbors.

“I can’t imagine that they (the
neighbors) wouldn't be pleased at
the beginning,” McLinden said.

“I don’t think the housing is go-
ing to solve.all of our problems by
any means,” Freeman said. “But
certainly the major thrust of the
housing proposal is to limit the con-

centration of fraternity houses in _

the community.”

One major problem McLinden

cited as being solved by the housing —

project would be the move from
old, run down ‘houses to modern
facilities.

“All of our fraternities live in
homes that were built at the turn of
the century as a one-family dwell-
ing, and they’re all at least eighty
years of age,” McLinden said.

McLinden said the houses were

By BARB MADAUS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Thinking of graduating? I was,
for a while. But before I made any
hasty decisions, Ithought I'd better
explore what the business faction
calls “job-hunting techniques.” In-
formation from my peers was the
first step.

.“You’re an English literature
major? Oh- You want to write
poetry and starve in a garret, right?
Very romantic.” 4

My friends in engineering were
the worst, though they were full of
snide remarks about jetting off to

California, Florida, Colorado, or’

New England, company plane
tickets in hand, bound for glory, a
company plant tour, and a $20,000
offer.

I suppose I was jealous. They had
planned wisely for the future, read
all the right books, and were coif—
fured and dressed according to the
suggestions of John T. Malloy of
Dress for Success fame. I've never
been any good at looking
authoritative, which according to
Malloy is the way to “get ahead.”
I’m not good at intimidating
anyone; in fact, people tell me that I
look too young to smoke cigarettes.

I knew that I would need. a lot of '

help to attain corporate standards
and keep my parents quiet. (The
neighbors wanted to know, “how is
the job hunt coming, Dear?” What
shall we tell them?-etc.) So, shed-
ding my “do-it-yourself” job-
hunting lethargy (one resume per
week, if you can find a clean sheet
of paper), I made my way to the
placement center. I had avoided it
for years, only passing by to cast
looks of scam at the goal-oriented
‘ engineers crowded around the

_printed interview schedules. A few I
/‘liberal arts notices dangled limply

from the few square inches of space
that remained.

I had watched the gray and blue-
suited future executives parade
through the Student Union all year.
As I stood outside the placement of-
fice, I tried to imagine myself at an
“interview”--hair neatly in place
(not in my eyes, where it usually is),
standard blue suit, no runs in the
first pair of pantyhose I'd bought
since 1977, efficient, charming,
knowledgeable. . .no, it was too

docile to be true. A more likely:

scenario: wishing l’d stopped in a
bar and stayed there until I couldn’t
remember my name or my career
ambitions, having spent two hours
trying to get the wrinkles out of the
wrong kind of blouse. '
Fearing for my life and sanity, I
would creep into the air-

apartment doa

conditioned little room, feet encas-
ed in tight black pumps, swearing
under my breath about formality.
With the first questions about my

goals, I would suddenly lose con-
trol, forget all my nice ambitious

answers, light acigarette, bring my.

hand down hard on the
interviewer’s desk, and start lectur-
ing about the evils of corporations.
This, of course, would be the end of
my corporate ambitions. The poor
soul would call in three gray-clad
assistants, who would hustle me
from the room and to the elevator,
warning me that they didn't like
“my kind.”

Did I have any chance? Would I
be doomed to shoveling fast food
forever?

One ray of hope remained--an in-
formative little booklet entitled
“How to Interview.” Most of the
tips in this informative how-to
make your wonder whether you
shouldn't send a robot programmed
by Norman Vincent Peale. The sec-
tion telling you how to enter the
room and greet your opponent (ex-
cuse me, interviewer) struck me this
way:

1. Never enter a room smiling or
frowning; you don’t want to ap-
pear over-eager or betray existen-
tial apprehension. Be as neutral
and bland as the three-piece suit.
you are wearing.

2. Move to shake the inter-
viewer’s hand only when it is of-
fered to you (likewise smoke, sit,
cough, faint, etc). This way the
interviewer will know that you

have no mind of your own and
that his corporation will be able
to outfit you with one of its own
immediately.

3. Never wear a flashy suit if you
are a man or a blouse that shows
anything you‘ might have been
born with if you are a woman.
The interviewer might brand you:
a.) a non-conformist, b.) an in-
dividual, or c.) ask you what you
are doing after the interview. He
(or she, in these liberated days)
might try to glean this informa-
tion earlier by chasing you
around the desk.

4. Do not sit with your legs
crossed if you are a woman. To
the interviewer, this is an indica-
tion that you are more interested
in hustling your fellow employees
than his clients.

5. Never appear unconfident or
uncertain about your plans or
goals. Do not break into screams
of “But all I wanted. to do was to
emulate John Paul Getty!”, if by
the look in your inquisitor’s eyes,
you can tell that there is a rejec-
tion in the offing. You can
always tell by the gleam in his eye
as he contemplates the deadly but
impersonal letter he is going to

send you.

6. Try to remain calm and com-
fortable, as if the interviewer
were a family friend or peer.
Forget the fact that your career
and your new Cutlass are on the
line. Ask him about his

Pre-school Future In Doubt

Since Cut Of Appropriations

(Continued from page 1)

“We are dealing with $90,000
unless there is a restoration to
$100,000 by the governor,” said
Montgomery, explaining that there
had been a cut in the appropria-
tions.

Yesterday’s meeting was called to
determine the academic conse-
quences for Pitt students training at
the center under Pitt’s child
development and child care pro-
gram if the preschool would close.

Pascasio said that four to six
undergraduate students are placed
at Arsenal for one term.

For the several second-year
graduate students that will be plac-
ed at Arsenal this fall, “it will be a
one-term shot.”

Pascasio concluded in her report
that from anacademic standpoint,
the plan “would be feasible for a
one-term period.”

Montgomery told the parents
Pitt’s support would cease with the
end of the term.

“What happens after that is en-
tirely up to you people,” he said. A
Lederman said that on December‘

31, 1980, a board of trustees formed -"V

out of the parents would take over
control of the school.

Montgomery said Pitt will donate
to the center whatever equipment
the university cannot use because
“we don’t want to be dogs in the
manger.” I -

Pitt receives 1/12 of the state ap-
propriations money each month so,
in effect, “the University is advanc-
ing the money” to the center, ex-
plained Montgomery. _

Pitt’s board of trustees will re-
main in control of the money. How-
ever, Montgomery agreed to send
financial reports to the preschool’s
parents committee after Jenny Tib-
betts, who has a three-year-old
daughter at Arsenal, told him, “We
would like to be informed on how
the money is spent.”

“Tomorrow we are having a
meeting with as many parents as
can give some kind of commitment
to Arsenal,” said Tibbetts.

Eileen Cane, a member of the
“steering committee,” .who has a
three-year-old son in Arsenal, said
she likes the preschool, “because of
the professional teachers that have
studied child development.”

She said that Arsenal is needed
because “you pay according to your
income and our incomes are not low
enough for Head Start and not high
enough for us to afford the private
preschools.’ ’

After trying so hard to live,

Thank you for your letter dated
July 11 requesting my opinion on
higher education, appropriations
toward state related institutions.

I am a firm believer and strong
advocate of higher education.
Since being elected to the House. of
Representatives, 1 have continuous-
ly without fail, voted for the
necessary appropriations as needed
to run our educational institutions.
One of the greatest resources this
country has are its people and the
human mind. I could think of no
more a -disgraceful act than for
government to neglect its duties in
promoting the development and _
abilities of the human mind.

I believe strongly in these issues
and as long as I serve an elected
capacity I will continue to exercise
that basic belief.

A Editor’s note: This isthe first of a

two-part pre-season review of Pitt ’s
1980 football team.

By BRUCE GERSON
Pitt News Staff Writer

In the months to come, the “City
of Champions” may be boasting

’ about another national champion.

The Steelers winning Super Bowl

. XV, you might ask? The Pirates

winning the 1980 World Series?
Well, even though it wouldn’t be
much of a surprise if the Steelers
and Pirates did repeat as cham-
pions, this writer has the 1980 Pitt
Panthers’ football team in mind.

Returning from last year’s ll-1
squad are 16 of 22 starters.

National magazines such as
Game Plan, Pigskin Preview, Kyle
Rote’s Football Preview, Football
Roundup and Street and Smith’s
College edition have ranked the
Panthers lst, 3rd, 5th, 5th, and 8th
in the country, respectively.

Game Plan magazine, who picks
the Blue and Gold to end up on top
in front of Ohio State, Alabama,
Oklahoma, and USC, says, “The
1980 Pitt defense is the best defense

.we’ve seen in our 11 years of

publishing Game Plan.” Such a
powerful statement as that warrants
a good look at the 1980 Pitt
defense.

empt from the lottery system
because she was in the “Provost
Scholar Program”). Barch was
ecstatic over her new room, a single
with two windows, a walk-in closet,
and which shared a bathroom, a
kitchen, and another closet with
two other single rooms.

But then, in letter dated June 25,

from Jo Ann Woodson, Barch was
informed that a decision had been
reached on where the area coor-
dinators would be spending their
year at Pitt: room 857 Lothrop
Hall.
“We have received and discussed
various options and reached a deci-
sion with regard to placement loca-
tion,” Woodson wrote. “We must
inform you of the need for the 857
assignment in Lothrop Hall, to be
utilized for an area coordinator’s
twelve month accomodation. We
are able to reassign you to 822
Lothrop Hall.

“We regret that your plans for
living on campus have been altered.
We also hope for your understan-
ding cooperation.” _

Well, Barch was understanding
enough, so understanding that she
understood she had been moved
down the hall to a room with one
window,’ a wardrobe. and she
would share a bathroom and kit-
chen with the entire floor.
“Needless to say, I am more than

Nine starters return to the Pitt
defense, ranked fourth in the coun-
try last year. Leading the defensive
charge will be three-time All-
American, defensive end_ Hugh
Green. Green, a 6’2”, 222 pounder
has averaged a massive 70 tackles
and 43 assists during his three years
in Pittsburgh. The senior from
Natchez, Mississippi, is an outstan-
ding performer and will be very
much in the running for both the
Lombardi and Heisman Trophies
this year. The Lombardi Trophy
goes to the nation’s finest lineman.
His excellent speed and quickness (a
4.5 forty) allows him to range from
sideline to sideline, which makes
him look more like a linebacker
than a defensive end. He hits like a
linebacker, also. In fact, experts
and pro scouts believe that Green
will make a great linebacker in the
professional ranks. _

Green was the first freshman All-
American at Pitt since‘ Tony
Dorsett, and also the first three-
time All-American since number
33. However, to say that Green gets
a little help from his friends on
“dee” is an understatement.

At the other ‘end of the ﬁve-man
defensive front stands senior Ricky
Jackson, a 6’2”, 217 pounder who
was named to the All-East team in
1979. Jackson and Green are what
Game Plan magazine calls “Pitt’s
two bookend bombers.”

just a bit upset,” Barch said.

Barch was also cooperatvie. So
cooperative she sent letters out with
an explanation of the whole deal,
including contracts, letters, etc. to
Wesley Posvar, Rhoten Smith,
Donovan Hughes, the State
Secretary of Education Robert
Scanlon, and Governor Richard
Thornburgh.

So far she has received two
responses from her letter, the con-
tents of which were printed in their
entirety in last week’s'issue of The
Pitt News. One was from Donovan
Hughes, the other response was
from Charles A. Gilmore, chief _of
the Division of Institutional Liason
under Secretary Scanlon.

Hughes wrote that he sym-
pathizes “fully with your disap-
pointment in terms of reassign-
ment.” He also wrote concerning a
posible change in her reassignment,
which “in my opinion, would not
neccessarily be beneficial for you in
that we selected ‘prime areas,’ for
your initial reassignment and these
‘prime areas’ are rapidly being filled
with upperclass students.”

And then, two days later on July
10, this letter from Gilmore: “This
letter is to let you know that we are
contacting the university about this
matter. We are requesting a im-
mediate resolution of the problem
and expect that the university will
be in touch with you with the next
few days. Should this not occur,
please let me know.

‘Senior Bill Neill (6’3”-250 lbs.),
another All-East pick last year, and
three-year letterman Gregg Meisner
(6’3”-245 lbs.) will return as defen-
sive tackles. Jerry Boyarsky
(6’3”—275 lbs.) will again be looking
right over the opposing center’s
nose from his middle guard posi-
tion.

A step behind the front five are
the linebackers. Since Coach Jackie
Sherrill chooses ‘to play a ﬁve-man
defensive line, he employs only two
linebackers, and one of them is
senior Steve Fedell (6’2”-230 lbs.).

The other linebacking position is
a question mark for the Panthers.
Sherrill has several candidates to
choose from; the most prominent
ones being senior Mark Reichard
(6’0”-215 lbs.), juniors Sal Sunseri
(6’l”-222), and Ray Lao (6’3”-214
lbs.). .

_ Another question mark for Pitt's
coaching staff is at the safety posi-
tion. Carlton Williamson
(6’l”-200), Lynn Thomas
(5’ll”-182), and Terry White
(5’10”-180) are veterans in the
defensive backfield. White and
Thomas play the corners and
together they accounted for seven
interceptions last season. Strong
safety Williamson, not to be out-
done, picked off three passes of his
own. Sherrill and defensive
ﬂi

“Your status as a Provost

Scholar is noted and you are to be

congratulated for this accomplish.-
ment.”

“This office, which makes the
assignments and prepares the in-
voice and contracts, acted on a re-
quest from Ms. Woodson for some
additional staff people in the
residence halls,” Hughes said in an
interview. I

“And I was told she had higher
administration approval for. that,
and that’s why we acted upon it.”

According to Hughes, the
reassignment to room 822 was

within “a prime space in what we
had available.” But, Hughes said,
“she obviously does not consider it
a prime space.”

(“If room 822 is so ‘prime,’ why
not give it to the new area coor-
dinator?” has been Barch’s
response all along.)

A call Monday to talk to Wood-
son, to inquire about the “higher
administration approval”_ she _
received, but the inquiries never got"
through to Woodson, andrshe left
for her vacation yesterday.

But her assistant Tim Snyder
returned the call.

backﬁeld coach Ron Dickerson will

be looking for a safety to comp1i- '

ment these three seasoned per-
formers. '

Among the candidates for safety
will be quarterback Rick Trocano
(6’0”-180). Trocano worked out at
safety during spring drills and word
has it that he played well. But, if he

did start at safety, who would back

up last year’s freshman sensation, 

quarterback Dan Marino
(6’4”-210)? Another question
mark for Pitt's braintrust to deal
with.

On the whole, even with the two
question marks, one would have to
use an exclamation point in describ-
ing the Pitt “dee.”

New Rules For Fraternities
To Take Effect In The Fall

housing,” outside of what he cited
as “one or two.”

Under new, adequate housing,
the students living in those houses
would be safer, according to
McLinden. _

The new rush rules, affecting the
time of year when fraternities are
engaged in efforts to recruit new
brothers, are intended to develop a
“more personalized” rush pro-
gram, according to Parella’s letter.

McLinden termed rush a “two-
way street,” as a chance for rushees
to make themselves known to the
fraternities, and a chance for the
fraternities to “show themselves as
they are.”

“If a rushee has not made
himself known. . .to a frater-

Snyder said he was not familiar

with the specifics of the situation,

nity. . .he possibly would not get an ' 

invitation back to the next two
weeks. The fraternities must go out
there and get to know who they
want to invite back during those
first two weeks. They have to go out
and make themselves known; if
they are really, truly interested,”
McLinden said.

McLinden said he did not know if
the idea was innovative or that it
was new policy in regards to other
colleges’ fraternity systems, but for
Pitt it is a “step in the right direc-
tion.” . '

“Every campus is different, every
fraternity system is different, and
they have to blend together on the
campus, ” McLinden said.

“It’s between a rock and a hard‘ '

but “once J 0 Ann decided that she
wanted the person in Lothrop, she
then picked the place to put the per-
son.” -

Does she have the authority to
break contracts?’

“The Housing Office does.”

The only clause in Barch’s con-
tract which mentions anything
about reassignments reads as
follows: “The University Housing
office has the sole right to make
room assignments in the residence
halls...and to approve room
changes initiated by the Office of
Residence Life. This initiation in-
cludes the option to reassign
students whose health, lifestyle or
behavior may affect the other
students in the area, as long as the
act is not capricious or arbitrary.”

Snyder termed Barch’s allegation
that Pitt cares more about ad-
ministrators than students as a
“simplistic” view.

“Whenever you have to change
somebody from an assignment,
there's this false dichotomy that
you care about the administrators
and that you don’t, care about the
students. I think that’s a little bit
simplistic,” Snyder said.

Snyder also described the “after
effects_”_ of the disruption from
room assignments, and he cited
“bending over backwards and do-
ing double somersaults to make the
person your displacing happy.”

place, and I don’t think it’s a case
of insensitivity or whatever. I think
that’s being too simplistic about the
real world,” Snyder said.
However, Snyder intends to treat

‘Barch just like another student, up-

perclass scholar or not: “Without
being too insensitive I don’t care
that she was an honor student. You ,
know, that doesn’t concern me.
She was a student, that’s what mat-
ters to me.

“The fact that she’s an honor
student, or if she was the son of a
legislator or whatever, wouldn’t
really matter. We’re talking about
a student. And there are three
students involved. Not just Therese
Barch. I assume all three people are
being displaced. All we hear about
is Therese Barch, but there were
three rooms there. I assume all
three of those rooms were filled. .
The fact that’s she’s an honor stu-
dent, per se, doesn’t mean
anything.

“Sure I want to keep intelligent
people in our residence halls, but
that has to be secondary from my
perspective to just a person as a per-
son... I I

“I’m sure we want quality at the
university, but I’m not going to
kick aykid on probation harder than
I’m going to kick someone who's a
scholar. Your statistics will show
the people who are on probation
need housing more than people who

don’t,” Snyder said. ‘

years it might be the corporate net
income tax, this year it happens to
be the LCB.’’ ’

McManus claimed it is a “strange
situation,” since the revenues the
LCB raises are not earmarked for
higher education, museums, or any
of the other non-preferred budget
items affected by the cutback.

However, McManus emphasized
that Pitt is dependent on Thom-
burgh having sufficient revenue to
cover the expenses of government.

“Consequently, in this situation '

we are dependent on the governor
raising some more revenue, regard-
less of what that situation might be.

We’re being ..affected really by’

things that are not within our power
to control,” McManus said.

Senior Vice Chancellor Jack
Freeman said the responsibility of

providing adequate appropriations.

belongs to the state legislators.

“I think we've all along been
given reasonable assurances by the
government that we would receive
our appropriations at the level
recommended by the governor,”
Freeman said. “We had done all
our planning on that.”

“Our position has been that it’s
the responsibility of the executive

and legislative branch of the‘

government to decide where the
money should come from. We’ve
never taken a position one way or
the other°on sources of revenue or
taxation policies,” Freeman said.

. Freeman said he does not place
the blame of the current situation
on Pennick and the LCB, but
“there are a lot of actors in the pre-

sent little scenario, and we trust that . ‘ l

the General Assembly and the ad-
ministration each have a role to

play in sorting out the revenue pro—' ‘

blem.”

“We want to be helpful if we can I

be but, basically, we think that's the
responsibility of the political leader-
ship,” Freeman said.

The High Price Of The New Exploitation: ‘Caligula’

CALIGULA

Directed by Tinto Brass
Additional scenes directed and
photographed by Giancarlo Lui and
Bob Guccione

Based on a screenplay by Gore

Vidal

By THOM PALMER

It is rather simple to cite the
culprit in this travesty as producer
and Penthouse Magazine publisher
Bob Guccione. To call Caligula
historically accurate is exaggerated;
to call it a film is blasphemous. It

. seems that every phase in the pro-

cess of making this “film” was
done with such dereliction, that one
can’t help but feel that Guccione
and his crew set out with the idea of

V making an absolutely horrid pic-

ture. The music invoked audible
decay, the photography was
amateurish, the story was non-
existent, the voice dubbing was
equivalent to Japanese sci-fi, and
the editing was done with all the
precision of a blind paraplegic.

So what happened? A number
of positive elementsrwere definitely
present for the making of a strong
picture. Under the reign of Julius

Caeser, Rome switched from a.

republic back to an empire. After
his son, Augustus, held the reign
for many years, Tiberius took over
after Augustus’ death. This is the
period in which much debauchery
took place, and this is also the place
where Guccione’s film starts. The
Penthouse publisher stepped in
when the shooting of the film was
supposedly finished, fired his direc-
tor Tinto Brass, and did some ob-
vious reworking of Gore Vidal’s

screenplay, turning the entire pro-
ject into a fiasco. Guccione claimed
that much of the activity with the
palace walls was being shot as
predominantly homosexual. What
a contradiction for a pro-
ducer/publisher of one of the
largest men’s magazines in the
world. It was easy to make
changes, blaming Vidal for his bi-
sexual tendencies, but this seems
hardly the proper reason for the
script being the way it was. The
much-hated Tiberius had

preferences far from heterosexual,
as well as being the perpetrator of
his own type of perversity in his
resort at the Isle of Capri. But none
of this is ever fully clear. Tiberius
(Peter O’Toole) is thrust into
perversion with no explanation, and
without really being directly related
to any of the atrocities Guccione
conveys to us on the screen with ar-
tificial graphicness. After the first
45 minutes, the story falls into an
abyss that seems bottomless.

absolutely nothing, is

Nothing,

redeeming in Caligula.

The four-year reign of Caligula
(Malcolm McDowell) is undetec-
table. The film has no sense of time
or progression. No outside
references are provided to establish
him as an Emperor at all. Instead,
screen time is wasted with needless
and exaggerated detailing of
Caligula’s idiosyncracies. We are
told several times that the Romans
love him, but we never see it. The
one time we see Rome, it’s full of
prostitutes and thieves. Out of the

Caligula (Malclm McDowell) in bed with horse lncitatus and attendant Charicles.

. . .screen time is wasted with needless and exaggerated detailing of Caligu/a,'s idiosyncracies.

four million people that fell under
the rule of the Empire, there are no
reputable citizens? The work of his
assassins _is so sketchy and out of
focus that it is a wonder that they
even pull it off.

Gore Vidal is one of the most
prolific writers in America today.
His attention to historical accuracy
is virtually unquestioned, as proven
by such works as Julian, Burr and
1876, to name just a few. To think
that any pieces of his contribution
to Caligula remain is absurd. In-
stead, the idea that had all the pro-
per elements for an intriguing story
and fine film, fell into the hands of
a man determined to make the big
dollar. Guccione took por-
nography (if there is such a thing)
and surrounded it with enough
splendor and publicity that he was
assured of scoring a profit.
Everything has a function, and
granted, sex has ‘a major one in
cinema. It seems to be one of the
unconscious components in the
human core that life is constantly
drawn toward. But to spend ten

minutes on ‘the vigorous ardor of’

two eavesdropping lesbians, or spic-
ing every state function with fellatio
and cunnilingus with no point pur-
sued of no idea injected becomes in-
furiating as well as tedious. The
debacle Caligula makes such
adolescent extravagances like 1941
and Jaws almost justifiable.
Miss it. Pass it by, ignore it.

You will not be at any loss in,

avoiding Caligula. For those with
specialized tastes, you would be bet-
ter off sticking to mail-order video
films. Guccione’s radio adver-
tisements are correct, though. It is
a new trend in filmmaking. It’s
called The Decline and Fall of
Modern Cinema.

Fripp announced to a capacity
Decade audience, “will have to
move to the back. This front area is
for dancing. We’re a dance band.”

And did he mean it.

On this Saturday night Pitts-
burgh debut of Fripp’s new band,
the League of Gentleman, there was
no King Crimson leftovers to be
found. No Robert Fripp solo
material. No Frippertronics. Not
even any vocals!

In fact, you wouldn’t have even
known that this was the Robert
Fripp, father of tape loop rock and
mentor of studio wizardry, if the
guy on stage sitting on a stool, play-
ing guitar, wearing an English suit,
didn't look so much like him.

But still, as a basic four-piece in-
strumental group, The League of
Gentleman was exhilarating. The

‘ Decade audience was clearly over-
‘ whelmed as they responded obe-

diently to each and every one of
Fripp’s commands and literally
danced their asses off. Few of this
rabid crowd remained cool, dry and
motionless throughout the night.
The League of Gentleman was a

. drums.

tight, methodical ensemble con-.
sisting of Barry Andrews (late of
XTC) on keyboards, Sara Lee on
bass, and Johnny Too Bad on
Their set consisted of
group-written material, yet to ap-
pear" on vinyl, that clung tightly

if Lﬂelguolf Genlen:(-r) nny To Bad. Rbert Fri, Saraie, Barry Andrews

to a dominating bass and drum
throb.

When it was all said and done,
Fripp and friends did everything
they promised. They were
danceable, rock’n’roll oriented and
cleverly not dominated by Fripp.

The League of Gentleman were also
extremely adventurous but seemed ,
destined for cult status.

The question remains, however,
where does a dance band go from
there? «

. . . they were danceable,‘ rock ‘n ’roll oriented, and cleverly not dominated by Fripp.

Southside Johnny And Asbury Jukes:  Workers With Class

SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY AND
THE ASBURY JUKES/ EDDIE
MONEY

- Stanley Theatre

July 17, 1980
By SAM MATTHEWS

Musicians from New Jersey are
known as hard workers. Concerts
by Bruce Springsteen and Patti
Smith less resemble musical events
and more like three hour plus
athletic endurance contests.
Southside Johnny and‘ the Asbury
J ukes are no exceptions. On Thurs-

 

day night they played a 20 song,
two and a half hour set to a near
capacity dancing crowd.

The Jukes are a large group.
Their line—up is that of a basic rock
band (two guitars, bass, drums and
keyboards) plusa ﬁve piece horn mﬁon.
Add to that three back-up vocalists
and the ever present Southside
Johnny Lyon on lead vocals, and
you have a total of 14 musicians on
the Stanley stage at one time. Even
if the stage was overcrowded, their
sound was crystal clear. Though
the horns overpowered the guitars
at times, there was no mistaking the
voice of Southside Johnny cutting

through it all. From the first notes
of “I’m So Anxious” to the end
with “Hearts of Stone,” his stage
presence and the sheer power of his
vocal cords gripped the Stanley au-
dience.

While the Jukes have establish-
ed their own musical identity.
breaking away from early Spring-
steen association, they still have
some connections with the New
Jersey bar band school of thought.
First, this is good time music.
When the Jukes do “We’re Having
A Party,” this sums up their on-
stage attitude. To them, having fun
supercedes heavy philosophical

raps. Secondly, their set was spon-
taneous. On breaks between tunes
Johnny discussed with the band the
selection for the next number and,
in one instance, grabbed a har-
monica for an off the cuff rendition
of an old blues standard. Jukes’
meat and potatoes like “Got To
Get You Off My Mind,”
“Vertigo,” “Talk To Me,”
“Fever,” (the last two are Springs-
teen numbers)‘ “On The Beach,”
the aforementioned “We’re Having
A Party” and “I Don’t Wanna Go

Home” were all performed in this

manner. Also kudos go out to Billy
Cross for stellar guitarwork
throughout the night, including his

Chuck Berry imitation on “Livin
In The USA.” *
West Coast rocker Eddie
Money opened the show. The next
45 minutes were devoted to an Ed-
die Money’s Greatest Hits.
“Everybody Rock And Roll The
Place,” “Can’t Keep A Good Man

Down,” “Hold On” and “Two
Tickets, To Paradise” were per-
formed in computer printout
fashion. The stiffness of Eddie

Money and his band stood as a
direct contrast to the spontaneity of
the Jukes. Eddie Money also pro-
vided obligatory references to the
Pirate and Steeler ballclubs at no
extra charge.
