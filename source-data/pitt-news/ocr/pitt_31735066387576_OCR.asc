talks on
home life
to blacks

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

In celebration of the annual
Black Week, the Black Action So-
ciety hosted a lecture Monday
evening featuring Attalah
Shabazz, the oldest daughter of
murdered black rights advocate
Malcolm X.

According to BAS program-
ming chairperson Lynette Wel-
lington, Shabazz was invited
because ”she’s a professional,
successful black woman."

Wellington said that presenta-
tions such as this one will ”touch
on all aspects of our [Black] peo-
ple,”'— citing men, women, ac-
tors, dancers and writers.

Following an address by Wel-
lington and an introduction by

The statue,’/l Song to Nature,

which usually stands on top of

the fountain in front of the Frick
Fine Arts building, was taken
down last Thursday to be sent to
Cincinnati for restoration.

The statue is a memorial to
Mary Schenley, who, in 1889,
donated the land for the park
bearing her name.

In 1911, Pittsburgh's City
Council donated $10,000 to fund
the monument.

A national competition was

held to determine the design of_

the monument, and after examin-

Alegria said that she was ”very
pleased” with the responses she
received d_uring her reading.

She spoke out against Reagan's

aid to the Contras and urged stu-

dents, to do. the same.

Polish police capture
underground fugitive

WARSAW, Poland —- Police
Tuesday captured Kornel
Morawiecki, the last major under-
ground Solidarity leader and a fu-
gitive since the 1981 martial law
crackdown.

Morawiecki, leader ofa mili-
tant Solidarity faction known as
Fighting Solidarity, was arrested
at an apartment in Wroclaw in
southwestern Poland, govern-
ment spokesman Jerzy Urban an-
nounced.

Arrested with him was a
46-year-old woman identified
only as Hanna L., Urban said.

He said Morawiecki was being
investigated on suspicion of
smuggling and-possessing false
identification papers.

Morawiecki’s daughter, Anna,
said from her home in Wroclaw
that she had learned of the arrest.
She said her brother, Mateusz
Morawiecki, a university student,
also was seized.

She said security agents from
the interior ministry searched her
father's home for six hours after
the arrest.

Morawiecki, a physicist for-
merly employed as a researcher
at Wroclaw Technical Universi-
ty, became active in opposition
politics after university protests in
1968,, his daughter said.

Morawiecki was on trial on
charges of attacking Poland's for-
eign alliances but not in custody
on Dec.s13, 1981, when Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
imposed martial law. He hap-
pened to be out when security
agents came to arrest him and has

Doctor who vanished

has police stumped

PITTSBURGH — Allegheny
County and Ross Township
police met Tuesday to discuss
their investigation into the disap-
pearance of a suburban doctor
who disappeared nearly two
weeks ago.

Dr. Ann Nishizawa, 29, was
last seen Oct. 30 at St. Francis
Medical Center in Pittsburgh,
where she was serving her
residency, police said.

”Ann never showed up to get
her paycheck on Sunday [Nov.
1]. That's when we began think-
ing something was wrong,” said
hospital spokeswoman JoAnn
Nader. —

Dr. Gerhard Senula, who was
engaged to marry Nishizawa and
lived with her, said he returned
from a business trip to their Ross
Township house to find both her
and her car gone.

Just what are we
observing today?

In the observance of Veteran's Day, there seems to be some-
thing patently disturbing. When our veterans march down the
streetsfwith crowds of cheering (happy?) people on hand, are
wehonoring the marchers for what they have gone through

‘ and trying to sympathizewith them, or are we paying tribute

to the institution of war, somehow glorifying it?

In their homes, away from the political speeches and com-
mercialism surrounding the parades, many Americans spend
time thinking about family members lost to.our wars. It seems
that these are the people who understand something of the
hohday.

Ifwe see war as the creator of heroes, if-people gain a sense
of respect for the institutionalized, officially sanctioned killing
of each other by honoring its casualties and near misses, then
we are certain to repeat all the mistakes. .

In itself, Veteran's Day is a good idea. No society or genera-
tion should be permitted to forget the bloodier moments of our
history or the people sacrificed in them. It is not a day to soothe
our consciences. It is a day to offend them, to show that war
is an unacceptable alternative to dialogue and understanding.

    I.E1'1'E_R   _
A more ObJ€CtIV€
critic is needed

It would be greatly appreciated (we're sure by a majority of your
readers) if you would provide The Pitt News with a more objective
music reviewer. We are referring to the article, "Sting bites hard, but
there is no venom,” written by your distinguished assistant news edi-
tor, William Young.

It is quite obvious to us that Mr. Young has completely missed the
point of the new album by Sting. For example, "History Will Teach
Us Nothing” does not convey Sting’s ignorance of world matters.
Rather, the song states that history has shown us a countless number
of times that petty prejudices have caused much strife, anguish and
bloodshed in the world. These prejudices are a part of that part of
the past that we should leave behind in order to attain some sem-
blance of peace in international politics. Mr. Young has been rather
hasty in judging the meanings of almost all the songs, not to men-
tion the fact that he missed the humor in a number of them as well
(For example, ”An Englishman in New York”).

The article is a contradiction in terms. Mr. Young was expecting
"another driveling album of crybaby songs about political and eco-
nomic problems that don’t deserve to have songs written about them."
Obviously, Mr. Young, Sting came out with something different. Mr.
Young seems to have difficulty deciding whether Nothing Like The
Sun is an album full of ’'pleasant songs" that he appreciates or if it
is an incohesive collection of random thoughts which unsuccessful-
ly deal with various problems. In addition, Mr. Young has avoided
some of the main topics discussed in such reviews. The arrangement
of the music is unique and melodious; the lyrics are pure poetry.

Our intention is not to persuade the student population to fall in
love with Sting’s songs. We realize that everyone is entitled to his
or her own taste in music. However, it cannot be denied that Sting’s
abilities as a musician are truly great. We wish to make people aware
of the fact that objectivity and clarity are a necessity and that each
person should be given credit where [it] is due.

Snow, bread and poetry

As yesterday's snow made evident, it's nearly
winter. Ahh, winter, so lovely a season, or at least
until February rolls around. But for now, enjoy the
snow. Take a moonlit walk through Schenley Park.
Smell, hear and taste the season. Waltz with your
shadow, fall down and make snow angels. Get real
cold and wet, walk home, make a cup of hot
cocoa and take a long hot bath. Whatta season.

”Volumihous” was the word used by my editor
to describe the mail I got last week. Thank you
one and all. There are some incredible poets out
there, truly.

Here's a little something from a gentleman who
refers to himself as ”The Walrus.”

THE USED SOUL SALESMAN
Up on concrete blocks

You would buy— but his forked pitch
makes you wary

' of his ways.

— The Walrus

Dear Mister Walrus, thanks for the poem, and
feel free" to send more if you'd like. I look forward
to reading it as does the citizenry. '

The following is an essay, of sorts, written by
Richard E. Pozzuto. He also wrote the short play
that was in last week's column.

I'm itching I'm itching to give advice — some-
thing like, "Don't fly too close to the sun or your
wings will melt.”

For those of us who dwell on the seedier side
of things. For those of us who are caught’ up in the
misery, pain, self-loathing continuance of ’’life.’’
To ‘those of us who are not poets, writers artists
or anything. To those of us who are nothing, who
have nothing, who own nothing, who are noth-
ing that hasn't anything and shall be nothing and
never had anything never shall own anything and
who are losing something everyday, despite there
being nothing to lose." '  I ‘

 

To those who lack a shtick.

To those who have a shtick.

To the whole world andeveryone on it. I have
one piece of advice  '

You may wear your wax wings proudly, but they
are only wax and will melt closeto the sun. 50
if the sun is where you're going. If it's light you're
after. If it's warmth, if it's truth, if it's love.

You will fall on your journey, for your wax wings
will melt, and you will drift for what feels like an

I” unbearably long time, and then you will hit the

Earth.
And IF YOU DON'T DIE, you will think hard
about what to make your wings out of a second

' time. AND IF YOU DON'T DIE, you will lament
a whole life spent forging wings of wax. You will .

hate the wax sellers, the wax givers, the wax
whores, and inevitably, you will hate the wax buy—
ers, the wax takers and the wax pimps.

IF YOU DON'T DIE, you will need to get on
with your life again.

And for that you will need  WAX!

touched to hear that horny people are welcome
in The Naked City! Being an official member of
TNC has really added to my life! In addition to our
membership certificates and gold stars, official
members should receive Naked City buttons! I'd
wear mine proudly!

Once the buttons are seen all over campus, The _ ‘f I

Naked City could suppl members with Naked un-
derwear (what a contradiction!) And once the un-
derwear is seen all over campus, ALL your letters
would be from horny people. (And we will liter-

ally have a Naked City.) I
Don't toss your cookies!
Oreo in May

Good to hear from you again, Ms. Oreo in May.
The Naked underwear idea is just a tad much, but
the buttons are a really good idea. Submit your
idea to the business manager of The Pitt News,
and maybe somebody will make your dream
reality. ‘

A friend and I baked bread on Sunday. Even if
the bread doesn't turn out very well, baking is
almost as therapeutic as walking through fresh
snow under a November moon. Beyond the ther-
apeutic aspect is the delightful smell that stays in
your apartment for days. Wonderful stuff.

Have a good week, and write if you want agreat
bread recipe.

You don't have to be born in The Naked City to
live there. Pack up your bags and move to the

only place in America where everybody is a star. ._ - -'

Making strides

rvlartin adjusting to rigors of Evans’ practices

By john Enright
Editor in Chief

Bobby Martin has been playing basket-
ball at Pitt for only about a month now,
and yet, he's already had one experience
he'll never forget. I

When asked to name a most memora-
ble athletic moment for his biography in
the Pitt‘ Basketball media guide,’ the

6-foot-9, >215-pound freshman didn't

hesitate. -

He went straight to the hoop. -

"The first day ofpractice at Pitt,” was
Martin's reply. "Man, I never experienced
that kind of intensity and fatigue in my
life." ' ‘

It got worse. A

The second day of-practice Martin told
Coach Paul Evans he hadn't had basket-
ball practice involving drills since he left
a Catholic school the end of his sopho-
more year in high school.‘ \

It's not hard to gather why Martin made
this revelation to his coach.

One of Evans’ drills was giving Martin
fits. .

At the beginning of practice, the play-
ers do a drill called "Perfection." Each
player dribbles the ball with their left
hand the length of the court and converts"
a left-handed layup. Then they have to
come back down and do the same at the
other basket. If they miss either of the
layups or lose control of the ball, they go‘
again. A

And Martin was far from the perfec-
tionist.

"I hated that drill. I was kickjng the ball
off my feet and kicking it into the

bleachers.”

But as Pitt closes out its third week of
practice, Martin has finally become ‘accli-
mated to the physical grind of Evans’
practices. ~

Said Martin, "I" slept real well after that
first practice. I was dead. I've adjusted. I

’ go home and do my homework now. Be-

fore, I couldn't even do my homework.”

Now, he just has to keep his wits about
him. I

"Bobby shows signs of brilliance,” said
Evans, who was quick to add Martin has
his lesser moments also.

”His only problem is he's young, and-

that hurts him with strength and endur-
ance, and it hurts him with concentration.
Right about [the end of practice], he's not
concentrating. He goes for an hour and
20 minutes at most, and then he loses his
concentration," said Evans.

With Pitt possessing a frontline of

6-foot-5 Rod Brookin, 6-foot-10.C,harles
Smith and 6-foot-6 Jerome Lane (both All-
America candidates), Evans said Martin

doesn't need to worry about being

pushed into duty. -
,His role will be backing up the front-
line players if they get into foul trouble.

”As long as somebody doesn't get hurt,
Bobby shouldn't have a lot of pressure on
him,” said Evans. '

Martin, who was a Parade All—American
at Atlantic City High School last season,
has been disappointed in his practice play
.but thinks he'll be ready for the season.

''I have a lot to learn and a short time
to learn it. I just have to play my hardest
and help the team in any way I can. I'm
disappointed in myself with the concen-
tration. I'm scared to get hollered at. I'm
so scared to mess up, that I mess up," said
Martin. , _

Added Evans, "Bobby gets down easy."

The fluctuations in Martin's concentra-
tion level have left Evans mystified as to
what he can expect of him this season.

''I'd like to getla lot of minutes out of

him, but some days it looks like he'll have ‘

a seat next to me for most of the year,”
said Evans.

"Bobby’s an on-and—off player. He's
good, though. I won't take that away from
him. But he's got a lot to. learn," added

Jerome Lane. _ _
However, tvans said Martin may start

Monday night, against the Canadian Na-
tional Team at Fitzgerald Field House be-
cause Brookin may not be able to play
because of a class commitment. _

That _in itself speaks well for Martin's
ability.

Six-foot-9 small forwards are a rarity in
college basketball, but Martin, who is a
good outside shooter, can play the po-
sition. .

"Bobby’s a hell of an athlete. He has
all kinds of abilities. It's just a matter of

' getting him to concentrate and getting

some consistency. His biggest plus may
be that he runs the floor very well. He re-
minds me a little of David Robinson be-
cause David was very similar. [Basketball]
wasn't a big deal to him, and he didn't
have "a lot of concentration. David
showed some signs. He was 6-foot-I O and
about 212 pounds when he was a fresh-
man,” said Evans. . ,

Evans said despite Martin's abilities, he
has a better chance of playing center than
he does small forward, where 6-foot—7
Nate Bailey will battle forplaying time.

big difference."
The ‘Panthers lost a total of
seven games this year by one

The Pitt soccer team finished its
season with a 4-0 win at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania, but
this victory still didn't dispelthe
bad taste of a disappointing
4-10-1 season. '

"I think by going on the last
game, the team finished well,"
said Pitt head coach Joe Lux-
bacher. "The thing was, all year
we had a lot of chances.’With the
exception of Seton Hall, we—were
in every game. We just kept on
finding ways notto win." _ -

Even _though the team is losing

"The key is that everybody has
to work. The emphasis is on the
players,” said Luxbacher. "To
compete at this level, players

have to improve in the off season,

not during the season.” ’ _
A big example of this is Erim
Cude. Last year, Gude led the
team in scoring with 16 points.
This year, he could only manage
one goal in limited playing time.
"Erim came in out of shape,"
said Luxbacher. "He is a very in-
telligent player, but he lost a step
during the off season. On;this lev-

goal, two of those losses came in
overtime. In the three other
defeats, Pitt was beaten by Seton
Hall 7-0, West Virginia 2-0 and
Bucknell 2-0.

"We had enough chances at
the beginning of the Ohio State
game to blow them out; instead,
we lost in overtime [2-1]," said
Luxbacher. "We outshot Seton
Hall 26-5. [We] did everything
but win the game. ' _ »

”This year was. a lot different
than others. In the three years that

 
 



couldn't do it. It eventually began
to wear ' on you. The players
couldn't help but expect to lose.’’

Pitt was led in scoring this year
by Dave Moss with eight goals,
while Mike Grimes had six.

"Probably the biggest thing that
hurt us this year was the loss of
Sam Lanza," said Luxbacher.
"He hurt his ankle in the first
game and was lost for the restof
the year. He would have really
helped our offense."

With most of the team return-
ing next year, .Luxbacher hopes
the [team will make a better
showing. ’~

finished our chances. We put the
ball into the net. The thing was
that we played [well] in just about
every game. We had the chances
but just Couldn't capitalize on
them.”

Going into this season, Lux-
bacher was looking for some
offensive help. Next year, it will
be the same.

"The loss of Sam [Lanza] hurt
usa lot," said Luxbacher. "Sam
was the best finisher going into
the season. Our other offensive
players are good, but they are
more set—up players. Sam is a

A finisher.

"Another problem was that we
had to play a few players out of
position,” Luxbacher added.
"John Osberg never played in the
back before. He made some mis-
takes, but as he learns the posi—
tion, he'll get better.” .

This was an up and down sea-
son-for the Panthers. They won
three of the first four games and
couldn't pull off another one un-
til the end. Although they
finished well below .500, with a
few breaks, they could have done
much better.

‘Luxbacher and his players can
only hope the breaks will go the
Panthers’ way next season.

Continued from page 9

Evans is hoping Martin's de- _.

velopment will enable Smith to
get some minutes at his more
natural position — power
forward.

"There will be an opportunity
for me to get some quality
minutes. When the games start,

- and I geta chance to get into the

flow of the game, [the coaches]

-will seeihow much I can

produce. ‘My part producing will
all depend on me concentrating.
When the lights_ come on, I'll
concentrate because I want to
play,’' said Martin. _ E

In a poll of the Big East coaches
last week, Martin and teammate
Sean Miller were named to the
league's All-Freshman First Team.

Martin likes the honor, but
doesn't feel it places any addi-
tional pressure on him.

"I don't feel as though it's pres-
sure. I know I have to step in and
contribute, and I feel as though
I'll do that because I don't doubt
my abilities in the least. If I con-
tinue to progress, I'll get better
and better.” '

While’ Lane feels Martin is a
raw talent, he still thinks there
isn't‘ any question he'll con-
tribute,

"He's 6—foot—9, what do you ex-
pect? If your 6—foot—9 with a little
bit of talent, you're going to get
a lot of quality minutes. As the
season progresses, Bobby might
start, or he might be one of the
best sixth men in the country."
