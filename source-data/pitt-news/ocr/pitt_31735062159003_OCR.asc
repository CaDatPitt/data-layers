For School Systems

By ALVIN MALAKOFF

"The only kind of revolution we
need," said Dr. Pickens E. Harris,
associate professor of education
and philosophy, “is a revolution
in our ways of thinking.”

The revolution, this mild-man-
nered man who likes to be known
as a liberal went on to point out,
should come through the school.
The present curriculum changes,
in over 30 states, of school courses
is a promiseof things to come.

He does not believe that oppos-
ing groups are really at opposite
poles, but that with thought and
compromise both sides will find
their arg‘ume_r:tIs approaching each
othen and ﬁnally integrating. In
the light ‘of this, he cannot believe
in the violent change urged by
radical reformers. If our concepts
of our place _in society are
changed, we will experience a
gradual revolution into a new or-.
der ofvtliings.

Inferdependent Society-

“Stru-cturally our society is in-
terdependent,” says Dr._ Ha1‘1‘iS.
5-‘but our ._wia'l and moral beliefs
are largely _ individualistic.” By
not - recognizing this in our“ social
and political forrngz we have never
given them a chance to be proper-
ly used. 2 »

“Democracy . has never de1noc’d

because we egavej ourselves’ free-“

ciom, but never gave ourselves the
knowledge to — go with it.” It will
work if. we give it a chance, is
his belief... . , . A .
.New_. of teaching will
help overconIIe the false ideas that
are troubling modern society. « It

will, of course, be a gradual

Synthesis Plan
' -A synthesis of the new methods
that have been advocated to do
away with a curriclum based on
unconnected courses, is the com-
position of his participation plan.
In this plan, the child learns by
cl‘oin.g and by thinking, rather than
by parroting what has been given
to him. .
». To the university student, he
feels that changes should come in
more faculty co-operation, small-
er classes, and abolition of the
outmoded lecture system.

That all Irisnot’ harmony in the
teaching profession, Dr. .Ha1‘I‘iS,
readily admits. “I believe,” he
said, “it is unfortunateithat Amer-
ican educational leadership is di-
vided into two camps, the so-
called progressive and the so-call-
ed conventional school people.”

It is this cleavage he feels that
doesn’t allow; both sides to appreci-
ate the’, ,.valuesof the opposite
group ’é.nd‘ consequently doesn’t

allow a reapproachment and the
.beneﬁts that would result from a
uniﬁed group.

Stanford Inquires About
I-F Sing Arrangements

Pertinent information regarding?

the annual Interfraternity sing at
the University has been requested
by the president of Interfraternity
relations committee of Stanford
university. I

The Stanford interfraternity
council wishes to plan an inter-
fraternity singing competition and
intends to pattern it along the
lines of what has been done here
for the past three years.

There are only a minimum
nurnber of the larger schools in
the country that have any kind of
singing competition, although a
considerable number have sings
without the competitive incentive.
The singing project at the Uni-
versity was originally started as
an all-school "affair to further the

Three years ago interest started

became the sponsor and added
prizes for the best team to bring
the Sing back into prominence. It
has now become a traditional af-
with .a
dance the evening before the be-
ginning of the Christmas vaca-
tion. This year’s dance and sing
will be held Friday at the Hotel
Schenley.

The Greek bulletin board is an

‘idea of Robert R. Corley, assist-

ant dean of men and faculty ad-
viser to fraternities, to interest all
students in fraternities and fra-
ternity men and affairs. It is on
the wall in the waiting -room next
to Mr. Corle_y’s office. Titled
“Keeping Abreast With the
Greeks,” the board holds clippings
taken from papers over the coun-
try concerning fraternities and
fraternity men. ‘

The proposed new nomination procedure, which, if approved,
would become effective prior“to next springs election,» provides that
“not«le.ss than 30 nor more than 45 senior candidates” and an equal
number of junior candidates shall be nominated by the executive
committee “for popular: election. Of these Hnorninees, "‘not less than" :20

Adjustment

By AUSTIN HAY

The versatile Fritz Kreisler,
who appeared recently at
Mosque, remains king of violin-
ists.

Especially representative of the
program was his own wel1—known
composition “Schon Rosmarin.”
His intonation, clear and warm,
gave life and exotic feeling, Aus-
tria with its thatched roofs and
muffled Vespers. ’

Loud plaudits for encores
brought the grey-haired Viennese
to -the foots repeatedly a wrinkled
white handkerchief in one hand
and his priceless
dangling from the other.

PAINTS IN OIL
Kreisler has a quality of perfec-

Iscripts. He is also an accom-
iplished pianist and hunter. ,

He dislikes social affairs and,
unless coerced, never attends any.
He always gets to a concert about
a half an hour early to tune and
warm up his violin—his audi-
ences have never been kept wait-
ing, which is rather unusual
among artists. .:

Of interest is the exhorbitant
prices that concert artists demand
——and get. Mr. Kreisler treats
this subject from an uncommon
point of view.

Bureau Notes
Local Business;

Still In Slump

_ Pittsbuigh economic activity
reached a yearly low last week,
according to the report issued by
the University's Bureau of Busi-
ness Research.

The weekly summanv of the
bureau revealed that the general
business index had slumped to
75.4 --percent, four points lower
than theprevious week’s record.
But the report also revealed note-
worthy increases in some branch-
es_ of business activity-

Despite reduced activity in iron
and steel plants, district railroad
carloadings of iron and ste§l,_prod-
ucts showed substantial increases.
Both‘ before and after allowance
was made i for usual seasonal
change.

I Department store sales also re-
flected increases, even after the
usual holiday gain was discon-
tinued. But sales in terms of
actual dollar volume, the business
review cited, were four per cent
smaller last week and six per cent
smaller in the four weeks ending
December 4 than in the same pe-
riod last year.

 Pitt made 13 of their 17 charity

leashed in on 6 out of 12. Pitt’s

g good iree-shot marksmanship de-

gcided the contest. Eddie Spoto—
lvich, burly grid scrub, led the
§B1ue and Gold attack. His two
lﬁeld goals A and four fouls, for
{eight points, gave Pitt the edge at

Tlicrc ARE limits to capitalistic “progress” 5

in Anierica. \Vhere is capitalistic initiative go-
ing to expand—at a proﬁt? A

Investments cannot‘ be plowed into expansion
of business to build more automobiles, more
radios, more bathtubs. Money cannot be sunk
abroad.“ There is not a sufficient return of
proﬁt, and there is too great a risk for capital
to turn to low-cost h0usi11g——A1nerica’s most
pressing economic need.

Just‘ , what is America’s
frontier -’ .

That. ;what we would like to ask of the
National Association of l\la1iufact.u1°crs. I

The p15’eséii.t frontiers might be wide enough,
if the American people earned a_ sufficient in-
come to buy back what it produced. Too great
2; slice is cut‘ off.’ as proﬁt, to be invested in non-
consumptive enterprises, which in turn raise
the volume of goods produced even farther be-
yond the reach of the consumers’ income.

More equitable distribution of the national
income might help to get us out of this dileninia.

But’ no. The Association ﬁnds, as a “road
closed” sign to its progress, “policies which
have the eﬁect of re-distributing existing
wealth and income instead of producing more
national wealth and income.”

The Association vented its anger especially
upon the federal wages and hours bill and the
Wa.gner labor relations act‘. Overlooking the
fact that business is now largely interstate, the
conclave urges that wages and hours be regu-
lated by state action.

It asked that labor unions be penalized for
violating contracts by being disqualiﬁed from
negotiating again. Since selling labor in the
market by means of negotiation is the main
work of unions———th'ey would be thrown out of
business.

fact that the Library is very much alive comes to
us as rather a shock. For it seems, after talking to

really read these books. This is certainly a g:atify-

Clarence 'Day’s book has deservedlycaused quite
a ripple in the world of, books. Writing in a con-
cise and lucid manner, Mr. Day treats the activities
of his unusual {parents with amazing freshness, in-
corporating in his sketches 3 human appeal that. is
undeniable. When the rest of our modern authors
concern. themselves with ‘the problems of moral
degradation, dcfeatism, and sordid human pathol-
ogy, Mr. Day’s wliimsical treatment of an everyday
subject comes to us, like 2:. much-needed. breath. of
fresh air. If you ‘are bored‘ with Faulkner’: mis-

cegenation, and Caldwell’s Georgia crackers, try

Clarence Day’s Life With Mother. V

Dale Carne,lgie’vs book is" not quite so deserving.’

Like» Eddie Guest‘, he dresses up the rather pale
platitudes of his shallow homey philosophy in the
garb of pseudo-literary respectability. He presents,
as something new and fresh, a formidable collection
of obvious “musts”_in the art of making friends and
selling yourself, that everybody knows but never
puts in use. ’_If yo_‘u_re_ad,_the book, you are bound
to be irnpre_ssed——for a while. Then, like last week".i
sermon, you will forget all about ‘it.  '

If" you want something that you ‘can .really.,bi;te'
into, try Cronin’:-' The Citadel. This book is a. best-
seller relating the difficulties of a British doctor.

who tried, in his profession, to _I_‘e,tai_n__l1i,s pre-
practicc idcalismf, According to Dr. Cro_nin_, it is
.-; :pretty‘ tough job. This book, although‘ ﬁction,
is almost‘ autobiographical; Dr. Cronin himself‘ has
experienced all the disillusionment of the fictional
doctor in his book. ' . J _ .

. The book has caused. quite a furore in the world
of medicine as well as literature, and quite‘ a few
of his colleagues don‘t like it a bit—-which should
make you want to read it all the more. Victor

‘Hciser’s An American Doctor?s"Odyssey is auto-

biographical and just as ‘interesting as the more
pessimistic Cronin novel.

Kenneth Roberts’ Northwest Passage I‘ have not
read. But I understand that it is an intensely ab-
sorbing historical novel. -It» is supposedly histor-
ically; accurate and fictionally appealing, which is
-certainly quite an accomplishment. It‘ it means

ciation of Manufacturers in convention. a.ss'em- .. anything to you’. it t°° is a bewsener’

For the biogifaphy lovers, jthei .,librar'y'hz,-is :1 Curie
biography enfitled; appropriiately, Madame -cane.

STOP and 60

By Nick Spanos

Penn

You’d think that “A Damsel in Distress” would
be pretty hot stuff, what. with Gershwin, Wode-
house, Astaire, and Burns and Allan. all puttin’
their two cents’ worth in. Instead, the whole thing
runs pretty cold. Every’thing’s there. Astaire is at
least as good as ever.’ Gershwin’s tunes are ‘nits
already. Ginger Rogers is no longer around. And
Gracie Allan has never been in a better show.

But the thing lacks story and as the crazy Krash-
nmurti once "told Yifnitz, his Lithuanian contem-
porary, “Without story you ain’t got nuttin.”‘ ' '

Of course, technically there is a story. The film

"is an adaptation of";a Wodehouse classi’c°but the

movie men left out all the Wodehouse ﬂavor. That —

was unfortunate. A Wodehouse plot without the
Wodehouse ﬂavor . . . well it’s like 801 without
Dean Lanfear or Heinz House without Deans Amos.
Something is Ir1issing'°.,.,_, __ ’ _

Reginald Gardnerimight have supplied that but
he’s_ never given the chance. Only once, and that
near the end of the picture, does he really let his
hair down and roll his eyes.

Stanley , . . .

“First Lady” is the George S. Kaufman-Katherine
Dayton conception of how the Washington. Merry-
Go-Round breaks down. Neither of the two authors
deserve too much credit, as they haven’t created
much. All they’ve done is to record the Longworth-
Patterson feuds with _just a little wit thrown in.
The result is very entertaining. V

You needn’t bliéve an of it, but there is some
truth in the story that the picturetells. Its theme
is that the hand that rocks the cradle‘ rocks the
highball and the Capitol as well. The women" ought
to like it, it ﬂatters them so. The comedy is all
broad burlesque with Louise Fazenda and Walter
Connolly getting most ofthe laughs. Kay Francis is
also in the picture,’ but that seldom if ever helps.

”Hot Lips” Busse heads the stage show. Henry
leads a large band with a large baton and plays a
sweet trumpet. This group doesn’t seem to be
straining a tonsil all the time in a mad effort for
swing. , _ _

Along with Busse are a couple of good dance,
teams. Why do so many people become a good
dance team?

  Calamity, Dear:

By Irene Long

A l-

the fact. that exams are rearing;
Yet, I jitter

so i’o1't11natc as to have 1'e.<;tlcss

slrorn a long line of Irish who in-
variably gave up hoeing potatoes
to suddenly tear off on sailing ves-
sels for parts unknown. This
streak first manifested itself when,
at the tender age of four, I ran
away from home, with a bag of
green apples for sustenance, and
was found a few hours later pur-
suing a lusty pig down a decrepit
country road.

, At this point, there is nothing I
should like to do better than whip
up into northern Canada with my
favorite books, Hudson Bay blank-
-pets‘, snowshoes, skates, a ca’n-open-
er, and’ a typewriter. There,‘ where
the air’ is pure and the woods are
‘free from picnicking tourists, I
would have a lovely time.

_While I'_thiuk of it, they need
engineers; up in that part of‘ the
woods. Therfe is a great road-
building project lgoing on.» The
ancient, rickety lane from North
Bay into, tvhebfpar north is in the
process of being paved. It passes
through. great forests, beside, love-
ly rippling lakes, and trails into
desolate. mining towns. Cobalt,
thehome of the world’s largest sil-
ver mine, is in‘.-its path, and one
sees" silvery rivers, bars‘ the deposits
from the mines enter them. There
are great lumber camps . . . and
‘husky’ lumberjacks leap lightly

bones. I, Calznniiy, am dcscended¢

turcsque indeed. I should think
it would be fun. for any ruddy,
willing, and able engineers to
traipse up there. There is a great
demand for them.

Now you, Mr. C)HV, iniglit want
to pant through :1 few jun_gles,. or
pulsate on the glowing sands of

about (so the ads say) whereas I
would have the gorgeous wavcrs
of the Aurora Borealis to grow
wistful about. But then, heck, I’d
probably have to shoo Indians off
the doorstep with my broom. Im-
agine ‘the little Indians whisking
aroundpon my broom! ,

Frankly, I think this streak of
wandering that afflicts many of us
is delightful, and not at all unfor-
tunate, as some_ of our more staid,
sensible -citizens seem , to think.
It's fun. After I “got through in
Canada I’d probably trade snow-
shoes for some ancient slacks and
tear off on a dilapidated boat
somewhere.

When it is impossible to do all
this the best thing, Mr. OHV, is to
read travel‘ books, "consult maps,
and take imaginary voyages. Use
your"imagination'““.’ J . tliat’s what

it’s for!‘ If that fails . . . try jig-

saw puzzles. ‘

Yours, sympathetically,

The course which began with
only two students developed into
a group of seven. One student at-
tended the class for over three
years, traveling some 300 miles»
each way for just a few hours on
Saturday." aft'érnoon.  " 

At first the classes were held
in the basement of the Cathedral,

door ,eX_haustin.g all ‘the oxygen.
Consequently, the students met in
the museum.

Another Student in the course
was an education major. He made

stuffing small mammals for dis-
play in his zoology classes. Since
then he has had several promo-
