 May_ sixth the  Club. of
«Washington held »a ﬁeld day in com-—

inerifioration of the anniversary, of.

Sa’r£i.uel, Pierpont Langley’s ‘ﬁrst aero-
dr'orne ﬂight May 6, 1896. The cele-
bration was held at the.Chevy, Cliase
Club. Prof. V\/illis L. Moore, president
of the Aero Club of VVashington, gave
an address on Langley’s work and in-
ﬂuence on aviation. Several ﬂights
were made by members of the .*'\i'l11_y’

Aviation Corps and Paul Peck of Gyro‘

‘Motor Company, District of Columbia

Mr. Langley in 1896 made the ﬁrs?“

successful ﬂight with his model steam
“aer‘odro.me,” thus demonstrating the
practicability of mechanical ﬂight. Tlie
ﬂig.ht was made at the experimeiitril
station 4 on the Potomac river.
‘made two successful ﬂights. He ‘con-

’ tinued his experjinents and finally con-

structed a large, ‘man-carrying nia-
chine driven by a remarkably eﬂicieiit
ﬁve‘ cylinder gasoline motor which was

' bluilt in the Smithsonian, institute un-

der--his direction.
This.time.' due to a slight defect in
tlie““ilaiiiiching apparatus, he failed, but

the would not admit it.

_He is now upheld by all modern
students of aviation and all' agree that
the Langley machine was correctly
built and undoubtedly would have
ﬂown if it had been properly launched.
Mr. Langley died in 1906; but it was
not until after his death that he was
accorded the measure of credit which
his experiments deserved. He is now
known as the “Pioneer of the Air.”

(the teachers of French in the second-
ary schools of Pittsburgh and vicinity
met at the University to discuss the
best methods of teaching French. The
meeting was called by Dr. Harry of
-the I_{omance Department. Prof.
and Jefferson
College led the discussion, and Miss
Steinert of the
High school dwelt at lengthupon the
importancevof insisting that the stu-

dent get a correct pronunciation of.

the language. A great deal of inter-
est was manifested in the defense’ and
criticism of the various methods now
in vogue for teaching modern lan-
guages. The High School teachers

claimed that the college entrance re-;
quirements in modern languages de-'

mand that the teacher “cover” too

- much g.round,.thus leaving but little

time for the important drill. work in

composition and conversation.
Arrangements are being made to

Reports on Smoke

Economic Survey Expert Desires
New Law to Eliminate This
Nuisance.

In his latest chapter of the eco-
nomic survey of Pittsburgh, Dean J.
T. Holdsworth of the School of Eco-
nomis, deals with the smoke problem.
which he declares is the greatest si_n—
gle hindrance to Pittsburgh’s prog-
ress. Not only is the smoke nuisance
a menace to health and an obstacle to
comfort, the doctor says, but it in-
volves an enormous loss to manufac-
turers, business men and citizens gen-
erally. _

Smoke elimination is possible, Dr.
Holdsworth declares, and he holds
that the present ordinance looking to
smoke prevention is faulty in that it
exempts heating and puddling fur-
naces, which cause a large part of the
smoke of the city. He would have an
ordinance covering the whole subject
and enforce it rigidly, and he would
also have a vigorous anti—smoke cam-
paign in order to arouse all the cit-
izens. He suggests the appointment
of a smoke abatement commission,
which would then secure the co-op-
eration of all organizations working
for social and industrial betterment,
especially the women’s clubs.

evening for the Bermuda Islands in
hopes of improving his health. For

some time past he has been in ill‘

health and it is hoped that upon his
return to his duties his health will be
greatly improved.

Dr. McCurdy has been working
very hard during the past winter com-
pleting a new text book on Oral Sur-

caused him to become in his present
state of health.

On the night of his leaving a large

ered at the Union Station to bid him

In this‘, the last. issue of the Pitt

and management, it is the desire] of
the Pitt Weeklystaff to thank heartily

the staff to achieve whatsoever degree
of success has been attained this year

the loyal, hard-working ‘men who
through their painstaking, conscienti-
ous efforts in their several positions
became the real strength of the paper.
Without them,-we could» have done
nothing. Then, to the members of the
Pitt Weekly Advisory Board, those
men who from their busy days gave
freely so much time to the affairs ‘of
The Weekly, much credit indeed is
due. For the help given us by
Chancellor McCormick and Secretary
Linhart, we are most grateful. Dr.
Linhart was exceedingly courteous in
placing at the disposal of the paper
To the deans
and_members of their faculties we are
much indebted.

'Alumni, students and faculty have
joined us ,i'n,our work in aimanner
which presages well for the success
of the paper in the future. Better co-
operation on the part of all the friends

ing our positions, we owe ‘a deep debt
of gratitude to all these friends who
have done so much to aid us.

‘For the incoming staff we ask the
same unselﬁsh co-operation.,The new
board, in our opinion, is the most cap-
able and the best trained staff which
has ever held office on this paper. It
is worthy of all thevsupport its friends
can possibly give it. In farewell, we
thank our many friends for their help
-and wish the new staff all success.

A LAST WORD.
During the -year just closing the
University of Pittsburgh has seen a
wonderful growth. In students, fac-
ulty and alumni a spirit of optimism

has prevailed which promises well for

0

the future, _Co-operation has been the
watchword of all the many friends of
this institution. Loyalty on the part
of the students and alumni has never
been so pronounced. With such an
atmosphere within the institution, it
is no wonder that the University of
Pittsburgh has made so great an ad-
vance during the present year. No in-
stitution can remain at a standstill
with loyal students boosting their
school, with loyal alumni devoting
both time and money in the most" lib-
eral manner to thepneeds of their
alma mater, with loyal-teachers giv-
ing freely of their time and strength
to upbuild the University. We have
been most fortunate this year, in o_ur
one hundred and twenty-ﬁfth anni-
versary, to have ihadso completely at
our disposal a‘l these factors requisite
for success. “A Greater University of
Pittsburgh” has been our motto—and
a long step has been taken toward the
realization of thieiimost ardent wishes
of Pitt men.‘ A

But this year marks but the starting
point. We -have just begun the ﬁght.
With so ﬁne a start, our advance will
be even faster. One thing alone can
hinder it. That one‘ possible drawback
is the spirit of “knocking” so apt to
develop in any university. We have
been, comparatively free from it of

c

late in the University of Pittsburgh. .

Criticism, where it is constructive, is
justiﬁable-—but never can “knocking”
serve any good purpose. We believe
that this evil is one which will not in-
terfere with our progress. The day of
the “knocker” at Pitt has disappeared.
The friends of the school have come
to realize that far more good by far
can be accomplished by an apprecia-
tion of what is good than by an in-
discriminate criticism of everything.
The large amount of evil resulting to
the school through knocking has
‘awakened students and alumni alike
to the consciousness that by such
means more harm than good is ac-
complished.

\/Vith the spirit of unanimity now
prevailing among students, faculty
and alumni, the University of Pitts-
burgh will grow by leaps and bounds.
We have all put our shoulders to the
wheel, and nothing can stop us. VVith
our curriculum improving in size and
quality, with our athletics conducted
in such a manner that none’ can cen-
sure, with student organizations
ﬂourishing, with the coming improve-_
ment in our facilities, the. friends of
Pitt may well rejoice. “Loyalty” is
the watchword. Live up to it. .

My Dear Mr. George :

I was somewhat surprised at our
lastbainquet to note that the college
yell “Alle-ge-nee, ge—nac, ge-nae,” was
credited to Mr. W. A. Johnson, Class
of ’9l. ‘

The person who originated this yell
is’Mr. John G. Stephenson, _lr., Class
of '93. who was present at the ban-
quet that night.

Mr. Stephenson attended Prepara-

tory School at Lawrenceville, near
Philadelphia, and this yell was sug-
gested to him by one of the Lawrence
yells. -
I hope that you will make this cor-
rection through the columns of the
Pitt VVeekly, also letting Mr. Kirk and
others who have _charge of these mat-
ters have the information. ' ﬂ _

Mr. Stephenson is a very prominent
and enthusiastic associate member of
our alumni, and I am very anxious to
see that this correction is made.

Yours truly,
Alumnus.

‘Pitt “Patts

By Prowler.

Last Monday evening, tired out
from a rather strenuous day’s work, I
arrived at the ofﬁce of the University
paper about 7:30 to do my little stunt
of writing up- this column for the
paper. My entrance was not noticed,
as every member of the staff was busy
writing a story, reading copy, or do-
ing something that took up his whole
attention. Selecting a quiet corner
and an easy chair (?)v I sat down to
think.

Now, perhaps, some of my readers
have tried this stunt of trying to
think. If so, you understand what a
very complicated art it is, especially if
you haven’t anything particular to
think about. I thought and thought.
and the more I thought the less I
thought (Slide, Kelly, Slide, we need
the run). 0

After a long time (which time I
spent in lighting a cigar and letting it
go out about one and one-half min-
utes after I lit it), therecame a lull
in the work of the -staff of the
Weekly, and all hands joined in a
little newspaper bee (you have all
heard of the fanning bee, but it is not
the only insect in the B class).

It was found that there were three

generations of Pitt VVeekly men illv

One thing above all others was

pre—eminent in-the conversation—the
steady and rapid increase in the_ size.

equipment, inﬂuence of “Old Uni.”

And the great new spirit of Pitt that

is gaining headway every day.
“Things a-re not as they were when

.we took charge a year ago,” said the

present editor. “There has been a
one—hundred-per—cent. increase in the
spirit of Pitt since that time. The

gradual elimination of the ‘knocker’

and all those things detrimental to
any school caused by knocking have
tended to raise the standard of all de-
partments of the University’. The
change is noted not only’ as it affects
the VVeekly, but it effects every stu-
dent organization.” '
“Many is the-time,” chimed in the
pioneer editor of the Weekly, “that I
have had to write almost the entire
paper myself when I was editor. The

Each man had some inter—7

idea seemed to be prev'alent’that as

I was the editor I was to write the”

paper. Now, the present editor has a
staff of men on which he can depend
for all sorts of aid. The work of the
editor is much more systematized
now than before. and there are more
men who are willing to sacriﬁce time
and energy for the
school paper. The man that gets the
position next year will have the ad-
vantage of two years’ experience of
others and should be able to put the
paper forward one more notch. Each
new year should bring anew advance

for the Pitt Weekly.”

No more was it hard for me to
think——I had something to think
about. The words of these men of
experience and full of the love for
their Alma Mater gave me plenty to
think upon. I thought of the future
of Pitt. I thought that I could see
ahead through the mist of time and
catch a faint glimpse of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh in years to come
when present students are out in the
great wide world of business. I saw
Pitt—-taking up the whole space in-
tended for it in Chancellor McCor-

‘ mick’s plan; I saw a student body of

Pitt, everyinan of which was full of
the spirit of Pitt—rea_dy to make any
sacriﬁce for the sake of dear old
“Uni.” I thought I passed through .'.i
great assembly hall in a great student
building, and on the walls were hung
the pictures of prominent men in
student life from the ﬁrst year of the
University of Pittsburgh on down
through the years.
ganization had pictures of its famous
men hung on these great walls. Not
perfect men—no man is perfect——but
men who dared to take the lead in
matters pertaining to the uplifting of
their fellow students, and “Old Uni.”

Well, well, Pitt, what do you think

score tells the tale, but the meet was
much closer than that indicated by
the ﬁgures 61 to 38. The Sophs went
strong at first but were soon over-
powered and forced to take "second

"Well.

Last‘Wednesday, the Tech nine
walloped the- Pitt team to the tune of
6-0. The pitching of Carts featured
the game, as he let Pitt down hitless
and runless, but it is hard to judge
a pitcher by his work against our
men as they have been unsuccessful
insolving every hurler they have
faced this . year. The players try
hard enough to win and seem to have

plenty of “pep” but the necessary hits.

are never forthcoming,.and no team
can win under such conditions. 

The only other stellar performance
of the Tech game was astop and
throw that Graves pulled-off late in
the game. With a man on and one
down, the batter rapped a hard one
between Graves and Arras. The for-
mer dived_for the ball and threw the
runner out at "second without regain-
ing his feet. He received a hand from
both Tech and Pitt rooters. Tech has
a star pitcher in Carts and hit fairly
well, but showed a miserable exhibi-
tion» on the paths. They bumped
Cooper hard in the ﬁrst inning, but
Over, who succeeded him, fared much
better. 1

PITT WILL MEET W. &,J.
. ON SA'l‘URDAY, MAY 11

The Pitt track team led by Cap-
tain Bryson will journey to Washing-
ton, Pa., next Saturday to participate
in a dual meet withw. & J. The
Washingtonians are touted to have a
strong team this year and seem con-

ﬁdent of victory but the Pitt forces ‘

also believe they can win.

While the makeup of the team has
not been deﬁnitely decided as yet,
there are several men who are sure
of their positions, namely Captain
Bryson, Matt and Jim Marshall, Ro-
senthal, Davis, Tinsley, McKinney,
Boots and probably Polly Galvin. Six
men besides these will make the trip,
but the work done this week will be
the determining fac-tor.

Manager Hall is trying to arrange
for a special car to take the squad to
Little Washington, but has not been
able to make deﬁnite arrangements as
yet. It is hoped that a large squad
of rooters will make the trip as the
meet will be well worth while. Both

Pitt and her rival have some classy

performers on the cinder path and the

meet will be closely contested in
every event.
The ﬁrst two places will count

three and one respectively and the
participants are limited to ﬁfteen con-
testants.

 

This makes the lneet abso-,
lutely fair for both.

  On the Eastern joarney

Lafayette and Penn State De-

With Penn——Manager Mac-
Krell Wins Every Match;

V Pitt Has Strong Team

The tennis team has been the talk
of the University for the past two or
three weeks and when the returns of
three matches showed Pitt the
lead, much praise was heaped upon
the Gold and Blue tennis
While everyone was pulling for the
team, many were doubtful as to what
the results of an Eastern trip would
be as Pitt has fared none too well
there several times in the past. While

in

all the players put up a splendid ex--‘
ihibition of the ‘racquet game, Man-

ager MacKrell was the particular
star and none of his opponents in sin-
gles were able to win. The match
between MacKrell and Page, the
Penn Captain, was an exciting one
but the Gold and Blue player won

handily after dropping the ﬁrst set" '

6-4.

The team composed of Captain
Wilbert, Manager MacKrell, Ebe and’
“Pat” Wright left Pittsburgh ' on
Monday afternoon and played Penn»
State on the following day. While-
some of the scores were very‘ close,
Pitt had little trouble in winning 5 to
1, Ebe being the -only Pitt man to.
taste defeat. The scores were:

beautiful and artistically charming
star of “Polly of the Circus,” etc.
Miss Taliaferro will be aided by a
coterie of players and will present a
one—act play, “The Return of Toi
San,” written and staged by herself.

In the supporting program George
Moore and Pauline Welch, a lively
pair of singers and dancers, will ca-
vort around in a most frolicsome man-
Frank-
lynn Ardell & Co. will play a delight-
ful comediette entitled “The Suf-
fragette.” Fred Haydn, Eddie Bor-
den and Tom Haydn are a trio of
laugh—provokers who will introduce
“Bits of Vaudeville.” Edgar Berger,
the noted ventriloquist, and the Gray
Trio will also perform in their nat-
urally catchy way.

A

in_Clark University, will speak to the
students at the weekly assembly on
V\{'ednesday, May 22. Prof. Hodge in

_ an advocate of the “V\/air on the Fly.”

He believes the common house ﬂy to

manity and is endeavoring to arouse
public interest against these germ
carrying “pests.” This problem of fly
extermination will be the subject of
his address on May 22. He is sched-
uled to address other meetings while
in this city. .

Dental department, left Tuesday last
for a four’ months’ trip abroad, mak-
ing Berlin and Halle, Germany, her
principle stops. .

ter inppghysiology and her untiring ef-
forts shown towards the advance-
ment of the students in general has
won for her many a friend. Her ab-
sence will be greatly regretted during
her absence by the students at large.

league and he presided at the business
meetings.

Baird of Wooster won the first prize
of twenty—ﬁve dollars. He «spoke on
“Industrial Peace” and displayed the
same ﬁne qualities of publicaddress

which so impressed his audience in

Pittsburgh when he was here this
year with the \/Vooster debating team.
Hawley of Colgate, speaking on
“America’s Mission,” won second
place, and Lane of Allegheny won
third place. The title of Mr. Lane's
oration was. “The Second Emancipa-
tion.” Mr. Irons delivered an oration
on Theodore Roosevelt, entitled “The
Tribune of the People.” His oration
and delivery were very good,,but he
was somewhat handicapped by the
fact that he had chosen as his subject
an individual‘ while most of the other
men spoke on questions of policy
which are of universal interest.
Cornell was proposed as the sixth

lmember of the League.
