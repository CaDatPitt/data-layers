Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor ponders
at his last Board of Trustee meeting.

O'Connor lashes out at Board
as his exit package is debated

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Outgoing Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor’s gold-
en parachute almost
crash-landed as angry
board of trustees members
questioned the exit pack-
age at last week’s semi-
annual meeting.

And _as O’Connor’s
parachute began to
descend, he chastised the
board and warned them
not “to misread my suc-
cessor the way you mis-
read me.”

The exit package some
board members were irate

over includes an offer for
O’Connor to stay at Pitt

and teach biology for

$177,720 a year.

Martha -. Munsch, a
Pittsburgh lawyer, voiced
the first concern over the
compensation package for
O’Connor. She called for

the board’s executive

committee to “review and
reconsider what the com-
pensation committee did,”
but her motion failed by a
vote of 11-7.

In addition, Munsch
questioned the sense
behind offering O’Connor
a salary more than double
that of the average biolo-

gy professor in a time
when Pitt is freezing all
other salaries and raising
tuition.

Outgoing chairperson
Farrell Rubenstein pas-
sionately defended the
package.

“I’m flabbergasted and
appalled at this resolu-
tion,” Rubenstein said.
“What does it say to any
other chancellor who
might come to this uni-
versity?”

Before the debate over
O’Connor’s exit package,
the chancellor publicly
blasted the board for the

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt’s board of trustees voted
in a interim chancellor, select-
ed members for the committee
to find a permanent leader and
approved a tuition hike of 4.5
percent last week.

The board met last Thursday
in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom, where Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor said his
goodbyes, as did his supporter
and outgoing board chairper-
son Farrell Rubenstein. Both
received standing ovations
from the board members and
the 75 or so people present,
although some board members
expressed disagreement over
O’Connor’s exit package
approved by the compensation
committee. (See story at left.)

Replacing O’Connor and
Rubenstein will be Mark
Nordenberg and J.W.
Connolly, respectively.
Nordenberg, a professor in the
School of Law, will take office
on an interim basis Aug. 1,
and Connolly has.already
begun to lead the board.

Lightning kills one,
injures two others
at Schene/y Park

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

One person died and two others were injured after seek-
ing shelter under one of the tallest trees in Schenley Park
during a lightning storm last week.

Jain Liu, 38, was pronounced dead around 5:30 p.m.,
about an hour after being struck by lightning. Dr. Chixu~
Wa Chen and Shih-Hisen Liu, a student at Carnegie
Mellon University, were also struck, and they suffered
various bums. Chen was taken to Mercy Hospital’s bum
center, and Liu was taken to Presbyterian University
Hospital.

Hisen Liu, 37, was originally listed in serious condition,
but by the weekend he had improved to fair condition,
according to a spokesman at Presbyterian. He was dis-
charged sometime on Monday and could not be reached
for comment. -

Chen, 32, who was visiting Pittsburgh from Taiwan, had
third degree burns on his feet and torso. He was released
last Saturday and also could not be reached for comment.

The clash of the weinermen

By Jackie Duggan
Asst. News Editor

The ding of the bell is sound-

ed and the competitors are in

their places. In the one corner is
David Piwonski, 36, born and
bred in Pittsburgh and a Pitt
man through and through. In the
other is Gene “the hot dog man”
Scott who claims to be a sea-
soned food vendor of
Pittsburgh.

Take a seat, my friends, as the
battle between the Hillman
Library wienermen unfolds.

For four years Piwonski
enjoyed a successful business
as the hog dog vendor on the
sidewalk in front of Hillman
Library, but for the past nine

months the man who wishes to-

be known as “the hot dog man”
has been giving him a run for
his money.

“I believe in competition but

this is ridiculous,” said
Piwonski. “What he is doing is
unethical and immoral.”

According to Piwonski, what
“the hot dog man” is doing is
also illegal.

Piwonski says he has four dif-
ferent permits, including a
Pittsburgh vendor permit and a
health inspection permit, which
legally allow him to be a hot
dog vendor in Pittsburgh.

“I have paid good money
for these permits and have
had to pass vigorous health
inspections,” said Piwonski.
“It’s not fair that he has taken a
good portion of my business
away and he doesn’t have a per-

, mit.”

Piwonski proceeded to show
the yellow board of health stick-
er on his cart and his laminated
Pittsburgh vendor card.

When asked whether he has

Pifl grad combines street and school in mog

By Julian Neiser
For The Pitt News

Jehvon Buckner used to
run track at Pitt. Now he
runs a magazine to save the
human race.

“This is a magazine
designed to raise the con-
sciousness of the readers. We

.CXpOSC YOU [0 a IICW p61’-

spective to create a solu-
tion,” said Buckner.
Buckner, an Akron, Ohio,
native and Pitt graduate in
black studies, is the
president and editor-in-chief
of Da Ghetto Tymz, a
magazine created to moti-
vate and inspire the

T African-American communi-

ty.
At Pitt, Buckner discov-
ered that his previous educa-
tion lacked the depth and
truth about African
American culture.

“I was really inspired by
rapper KRS 1, who spoke at
Pitt in 1990. He made me
realize how African
Americans have been
exploited and misrepresented
in history,” Buckner said.

After KRS I discussed
the truths about topics
such as the Emancipation
Proclamation, and how real-
ity is different from what
schools teach, Buckner said

"he realized he needed to

be self-reliant in his educa-

tion.

“I am obsessed with learn-
ing as much as I can and
translating it to my people
on a level where there is no
hierarchy,” said Buckner.

Buckner believes teaching
and communicating with
others is his calling. Don’t
be mistaken, he is not pas-
sively passing on informa-
tion.

“I throw punches,’ said
Buckner, “.I want to put out
a positive conscious mes-
sage that will wake people
up.”

Buckner’s writing was
rejected by Jet and Ebony
magazines, as well as other
African-American-oriented
magazines, because it was
too strong for those maga-
zines’ middle-of—the-road
approach to “fashionable
culture.”

“I was seeking help from
people who supposedly rep-
resented our culture and
found they were afraid to say
what they really thought,”
said Buckner.

Buckner’s combination of
a _street and scholastic
background allows him to
not only speak the truth
about the realities of life, but
he can do it in a profession-
al, crystal-clear manner
without losing its bite or
intent.

“Maybe some of my elders

9

have a fear and jealousy of
what they were supposed to
be,” said Buckner.

Buckner’s response to the
rejection of his work was to
create his own magazine.

In April of 1993, he print-
ed out a five-page newspaper
and passed it out into
the neighborhood, tell.ing
people to pass it on to
someone else. Not only were
people reading it, they were
asking to contribute.

“People saw we are
killing ourselves and are
not aware of our history”
said Buckner. “When others
started contributing, it
showed that anger can be
transferred into creativity for
everyone.”

The newspaper was
upgraded to a color maga-
zine in May of 1994 and
presently circulates over
1,000 copies to New York,
New Jersey, Washington and
other major urban areas.

Locally, his magazine can
be found at the New World
Book Store, the Third World
Trading Post and the Wood
St. Emporium for $2 a copy
or by yearly subscription for

“I am real to the people.”
said Buckner. “I want to
prove that education can
break off the image of the
African-American communi-

ty.”

first time since his April res-
ignation announcement.

“I hope that those of you
who will search for the uni-
versity’s 17th chancellor
will articulate the institu-
tional values, missions and
goals which, upon my
arrival, was distinguished in
its absence,” he said.

Along with urging the
board to “avoid the turmoil
you have created for me”
with regards to his succes-
sor, O’Connor spoke of the
improvements Pitt has seen
since his arrival. He passed
out a nine—page booklet
highlighting his accomplish-
ments, such as the city’s
approval of the Master
Space Plan, a comprehen-
sive 20-year plan for the
redesigning of Oakland and
Pitt.

O’Connor’s booklet also
pointed out the formation of
a diversity task force and the

increase in minority student

recruitment among his other
accomplishments.

In addition to those, the
chancellor pointed out some
“highlights” in his booklet
that were vastly criticized
by people in and out of Pitt,
such as the decision to retain

°From page 1
his ideas and where he sees
the board going in upcoming
years.

“I’m concerned about our
public image, about student
retention, about the attempt of
the faculty to form a teachers’
union,” Connolly said.

«A major decision made by
the board was to approve a
tuition raise of 4.5 percent for
the 1996 fiscal year, which
means a $222 increase for in-
state students and a $484
increase for out—of-state stu-
dents.

The board released a back-
ground statement concerning
the tuition increase. It stated
the increase was necessary
because the “Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania may not
approve a budget before June
30 [and] it is necessary for the
university to advise students

I and their families of the cost

for the coming school year in
a sufficient time for them to
plan their finances appropri-
ately.”

The resolution raising
tuition left open the possibili-
ty the rates could be
reduced in “the event
that the Commonwealth
Appropriation for the

University is approved in an
amount greater then the
amount currently included in
the proposed budget.”

The board also officially
approved Nordenberg as
interim chancellor.

“He has served with distinc-
tion in challenging roles in
the past at the University of
Pittsburgh,” Connolly said.

As Nordenberg moves into
his new office, the search
committee will begin its work
to find a permanent chancel-
lor for Pitt. Along with three
student representatives, who
will be picked from next
year’s undergraduate and
graduate student govern-
ments, the committee mem-
bers include eight trustees and
12 representatives from Pitt
staff, faculty ‘and administra-
tion.

“I am confident that the
members of the search com-
mittee will meet this chal-
lenge and move the search
process forward as expedi-
tiously as possible,” said
Connolly in a press release
issued by Pitt at the meeting.

Connolly also said Pitt has
hired a professional firm,
Korn/Ferry International out
of Washington, to aid in the

search.

Hot Dogs

a permit Scott said, “What do you
think? I wouldn’t be here from day
one if I didn’t, now would I?”

Recently the two big dogs went
head-to-head involving campus and
city police.

On Monday, June 19 Scott was
cited for disorderly conduct by Pitt
police. Police investigated after
receiving an anonymous call that
the vendors were fighting.

Both vendors deny they were
fighting that day.

Scott claims he was discriminated
against because he’s black.

“I was set up,” said Scott. “It was
racism to the max.”

Scott believes Piwonski planned
the call and the university and city
police were trying to make “a good
name” for themselves by going
after an easy target.

According to Pitt Police Captain
Tim Delaney, it was the city police
who received a call saying there

iwas a dispute between the two hot
i dog venders.

“Pitt police only became involved
after the city police requested
assistance,” said Delaney.

The assistance was necessary
after Scott did not produce a valid
vendor permit.

“He produced an expired vending
license,” said Delaney. “He [Scott]
claimed he left the valid license at
home.”

According to Delaney, this is not

“If this was about a ‘race thing,’
I wouldn’t have insisted the hand-
cuffs be taken off and he [Scott] be
let out of the city police car,” said
Delaney.

Apparently Scott was on his way
to police headquarters when
Delaney stepped in. Scott was

“He has robbed me of my joy, I can’t be the Dave-
guy that everyone used to know and love.”

the first time he has been asked for
proof of a vending permit.

“For someone in the vending
business he should know better,”
said Delaney. “It’s like driving a
car without a valid driver’s
license.”

Scott did produce proper docu-
ments to the police, but not before
he was handcuffed and put in the
back of a police car.

Delaney felt the matter could
have been handled in a milder fash-
ion.

conduct but was allowed to
resume business as usual through-
out the day.

“It’s about capitalism,” said
Delaney. “It is between the two
of them and I don’t want my
officers involved. The whole thing
is unfortunate. I used to go there
to eat, but who needs the hassle?”

Piwonski admits the fighting has
taken its toll on him as a person.

“He has robbed me of my joy,”
said Piwonski. “I can’t be the

Dave—guy that everyone used to
know and love.”

Ada Mezzich, a fourth-year stu-
dent at Pitt. has known Piwonski
about three years.

“Dave always makes it a point to
make me smile when I walk by,”
she said. “He really believes in the
product he sells. He is a person of
integrity.’’

Tradryce Morgan, a film studies
major, says she prefers giving Scott
her business.

“Scott gets along with everyone,”
said Morgan. “That other hot dog
guy is vindictive.”

Scott said as far as he is con—
cerned the other vendors on the
street do not exist.

“I’m just looking straight ahead,”
said Scott.

But Piwonski disagrees.

“He is hiding behind the umbrella
of discrimination to get around his
legal responsibilities as a vendor,”
said Piwonski. “And it’s killing my
livelihood.”

For now, the round is over, but
there are many more dogs to be
sold, so keep a lookout for the
bickering weeniemen.

Thank you, Dr. Salk

We would like to take this time to pay tribute to a great man
whose contributions to society were invaluable. Jonas Salk
died Friday, June 23, at La Jolla, Calif., due to heart failure.

Salk’s accomplishments began in the 1940s when he helped
with research to develop a flu vaccine. At the age of 34, Salk
moved to Pittsburgh to take a position at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Two years later, Salk was
named director of the university’s virus research facility.

In 1952 Salk began his research with the polio virus. He
tested the blood of afflicted children and later inoculated
them with what would become the polio vaccine. The follow-

.ing year Salk injected himself, his wife and their three sons

with the experimental vaccine. Within another year, the vac-
cine was tested nationwide on 1.8 million school children.
The results of the test were announced in 1955, and Salk offi-
cially became known for the development of the polio vac-
cine.

His research, however, would not be recognized for its
importance until long after it became outdated by Dr. Albert
Sabin’s oral polio vaccine. Salk’s experimental methods were
criticized by the medical community for being too risky. In
order to test his knew vaccine, Salk had to inject his subjects
with a weakened version of the virus. The results of this could
be either that the body would build the necessary antibodies
to kill the virus, or the subject would develop the polio virus.
The early stages of Salk’s research proved that both were

_ entirely possible. However, the end result was an inoculation

which saved millions of lives.

Salk’s medical career certainly did not end with his polio
vaccine. In his later life, Salk moved to California where he
began looking for a possible AIDS vaccine in 1986. By 1991
Salk’s’ researchers began testing HIV- infected patients with
an experimental vaccine. Five months before he died, the
Food and Drug Administration approved further experimenta-
tion and trial use of Immunogen, a potential AIDS vaccine. ,

Salk’s discovery of the polio vaccine not only saved mil-
lions of lives, but also puttthe University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine on the map. Both the medical community and the
university community owe a great deal to Dr. Salk for daring

“to break convention and do what needed to be done. Had Salk

been afraid of taking the risk with polio, the world would still
cower from a mysterious deadly disease.

Perhaps the rest of us and the rest of this university needs to
make an example of Dr. Salk. Breaking with tradition and
taking risks is always frightening, but it is the only sure way

_to progress. Salk took the greatest risk —-— potentially infecting
his own family with polio — while trying to achieve progress.
This university sorely needs to break from the boundaries of

convention and approach the 21st century. If Salk’s example
is ignored, Pitt will surely be leftbehind when the rest of the
community moves on to bigger and better things.

Confessions of Cl girl-watcher

Y
Mfriend
3 Tracey

has a way of

always remind-

ng me that I’m
man.

It’s not that

 

- 4 she tries to.
lgggﬁmnlst When I met
Nowlin . her, I was

involved with
someone else,
and in the six years we’ve
known each other, we’ve
never actually dated. We go
Dutch treat to Pirate games,
plays, Kennywood Park and
the Shadyside Balcony, and
that’s comfortable for us.

However, one unexpected
(and welcome) consequence
of our relationship is that
when one of us is wearing
something the other finds
attractive, the other says so.
One evening last summer we
made plans to attend a Pirate
game, and she showed up in a
miniskirt. Yes, I noticed. (And
she’s very pretty anyway —-— at
least according to my stan-
dards.) This spring we went to
see “Chemin de Fer” at
Stephen Foster, and I just
threw on a wool blazer over a
sweater. She said she liked
that on me.

I know what you’re think-
ing: Why didn’t you hit on
her? On the other hand, what
would be the point? I see no
reason why we can’t enjoy the
relationship as it is. Just
because she’s wearing cloth-
ing that I may like is no
excuse for me to think that
she’s trying to seduce me, or
vice versa, for that matter.

Now, I’ll be honest with
you: Like most men, I’m a
“gir1-watcher,” and some
clothes I find more attractive
than others. For example,
dresses and skirts well below
the knee, stirrup pants, high-
heeled patent-leather pumps,
espadrilles and patterned
nylons are almost guaranteed
to catch my eye. (My favorite
color is ivory.) On occasion,
some of the outfits that I’ve
seen some of my female col-

leagues here at The Pitt News
in have caused me to look up
from the word processor;
however, as I’m so much
older than they and don’t want
to come across as a “dirty old
man,” I keep my admiration to
myself.

That, I think, is the differ-
ence between me and a lot of

men. I’ve never been arrogant.
enough to believe that all —

these women are after me
(truth is, I knew they never
were); so even if someone is
indeed “dressed to kill,” 1
don’t. take it personally.
Perhaps she likes the way she
looks, and that’s fine by me.

‘ Furthermore, I really
believe that most people dress
for themselves, not for some-
one else —— I know I’m that
way. Since I get to dress up so
rarely, I almost always wear a
suit and tie to church,ban-
quets and parties; for my high
school class reunion last year,
I even bought my first double-
breasted suit. I really couldn’t
care less what women think,
although I’ve been told I’ve
turned a few heads on occa-
sion. (1 find this hard to
believe, since I don’t think of
myself as particularly hand-
some.)

On the other hand, for some
reason, a lot of men seem to
think that if a woman is fash-
ionably dressed, she’s possi-
bly interested in sex, and this
may be where a lot of the sex-

ual harassment comes into

play. Strangely enough, men
may actually be intimidated
by a good-looking woman;

' that doesn’t surprise me, con-

sidering the amount of nerve
they feel it takes to approach
one and the fear of being shot
down. (Remember, a rapist
doesn’t want sex so much as
power, and that desire may be
a response to such fear.) On
the other hand, I read a survey
a number of years ago which
noted that high school boys
were more likely to approach
a girl who was wearing jeans
than one in a dress —- because
the boys felt more comfort-
able.

(Note to women: If you
want to have a good time at a
fraternity party and not have
guys try to hit on you, you
may want to consider wearing
conservative, business-type
clothing. Anything else,
they’ll be all over you,-That
is, until people start getting
plastered. Then, all bets are
off.)

. Ironically, once people do
connect and don’t feel the
need to impress each other,
their dressing habits change.
At the beginning of the rela-
tionship with my former girl-
friend, I showed up at her
house one evening for a
“night in,” and she was wear-
ing a ﬂannel shirt and jeans.
She went upstairs to change
—-— and thought, “Wait a
minute! This is Rick!” She
came back down as she was.
You see, she knew I accepted
her as she was and didn’t real-
ly need to stimulate my atten-
tion (although I certainly
don’t mind if she does).
Indeed, when we met, we
were casually dressed as’ it
was, so each of us already
knew -what the other looked
like in “civilian clothes.”

And that’s important too, as

I’ve always known that every- ~

one needs to be appreciated

no matter what he or she looks —

like. One’s personality, char-
acter and values don’t change
with his or her clothes -—- at
least I don’t think so. When
the fancy suits and dresses
and high heels come off and
you’re left with just a vulnera-
ble person, real relating
begins. (Perhaps placing less
emphasis on appearances
would cut the divorce rate.)

Who knows what Tracey
will be wearing when we go
out again? On the other hand,
who cares? We just plan to
have a good time together,
whatever we do. And if she is
wearing something cute, I’ll
probably look.

But I won’t touch.

Vcﬁﬁeiimg their opinions...

God help us (oops!)

Erika Kendra’s column on
the graduation ceremony
prayer controversy at Peters
Township High School, in
which she supports the vale-
dictorian (Kerry Ann George)
who led a prayer in spite of
legal action, requires a
response.  It is quite obvious
 that seeking to prevent
prayer at a public school func-
tion is an attempt to protect the
First Amendment, not tear it
down.

Several points need to be
addressed individually:

l. Kendra uses the tired old
straw man argument that the
phrase “separation of church
and state” does not appear in
the Bill of Rights, thus claim-
ing that the separation princi-
ple was not intended by the
founders. On the contrary, the
separation principle has exist-
ed in America since the early
1600s, when Roger Williams
(founder of Rhode Island)
talked about a “hedge”
between church and state. Both
Thomas Jefferson and James
Madison were ardent separa-
tionists 

2. The 1962 Engel v. Vitale
ruling did not remove prayer-

r---------------

Ride the Raptor, Magnum, Gemini,

 

from public schools. Students
had — and still have — the
right to pray in school. What
the ruling did was ensure that
the government (federal, state
or ,local) cannot sponsor
prayer. Also, roughly half of
the states had already removed
official prayer from their pub-
lic schools by the time the rul-
ing was set down.

3. Most' disturbing were
Kendra’s remarks about major-
ity rule. The entire point of the
existence of the Bill of Rights
is to protect certain fundamen-
tal rights from the whims of
the majority (recall that many
of the 13 original states
refused to ratify the
Constitution without a Bill of
Rights)  .

To say this incident leaves a
bad taste in my mouth is an
understatement. The issues are
difficult to resolve (freedom of
speech vs. freedom of reli-
gion). One might even admire
George for a non-violent act of
civil disobedience. But it is
possible to admire George for
standing up for her convictions
and at the same time disagree
with those convictions.

Christopher J. Sirola
Graduate Student, FAS

Columnist Erika Kendra is
certainly not wrong for com-
mending Kerry Ann George’s
exercising her freedom of
speech and following her
heart, and I am sure that all the
Christians in the audience were
pleased at yet another victory,
one in which religion entered a
place formally devoid of it.

I believe that they have
schools that use religion as the
backbone of their education,
and regularly include prayers
in their day. We all know these
to be Catholic schools, or
Christian schools, for instance.

In public schools, students
find a place where everything
is not taught with a religious
bent, and students find that
there is education separate
from religion. Perhaps the idea
of separation of church and
state was pulled out of context,
but is it not a valid idea?

I believe that religion can be
good, but I also believe that it
has been creeping into politics
too often lately. If people want
religion, can they not celebrate
it at their own homes and
churches? I do not understand
why they feel that everyone
would benefit from their reli-
gion and their beliefs.

If George had truly wanted

to exercise her freedom of
speech, and show “Jane Doe”
and all those opposed how
bold she could be, she should
have presented prayers in all
the different religions repre-
sented by the students in her
school, because even though
the Christians would like to
believe it, theirs is not not the
only religion, and they are not
always right. I fear that George
may have given the already-
too—proud Christian Coalition
something else to celebrate;
next, Peters Township may
find themselves fighting to
keep some of their books in
their library, and how is that
for free speech?

Off-key commentary?
I am the violinist referred to
by Tara Munkatchy in the June
21 preview for “‘Tis Pity She’s
a Whore.” While I appreciate
the essentially favorable views
she expressed on the produc-
tion of the play, I don’t feel the
personal pot-shot at me was
particularly necessary. I am
mentioned by her as being a
strolling violinist, a part of the

However, I do not appreciate
being called a “wanna-be rock
star/psychiatrist lawyer.” Even
if my personal aspirations
(taken directly from the play-
bill and not from any personal
interview, incidentally) have
anything whatsoever to do
with the production of the play,
which they certainly do not.
there was no reason to insult
me by calling me a “wanna—
be.” I am just a soon-to—be
junior here at Pitt, trying to
make my way through college
like everyone else. I don’t see
what having plans and desires
for my future has to do with
the play, or how they make me

.a “wanna—be.”

Also, I have not been “hired
to stroll through the audience,”
as Ms. Munkatchy stated. I am
performing in this play as a
favor and not getting paid. 1
would appreciate some facts
being kept straight!

Next time, Ms. Munkatchy,
try looking a little bit beyond
the press kit before writing a
preview. Try seeing a perfor-
mance, or even a complete
rehearsal. It helps!

Indie-pendence day is fast
upon us. July 4th is that
esteemed day when
Americans nationwide eat hot
dogs, drink beer and watch
fireworks. Well, Pittsburgh
knows how to party and when
indie(sic) rock is involved,
there’s bound to be no end to
the celebration. Monday, July
3rd, Luciano’s Coffeehouse
hosts one of this summer’s
best shows yet. They’re not
British (oh no)  they’re not
corn-fed American rockers
either(too cliche) .They’re
Matador recording artists
Bailter Space, one of New
Zealand’s finest musical
exports.

Bailter Space is one of those

bands that make critics sweat.

The band has an interesting
sound and it's not easily
described. Of the past three
Matador releases ( Robot
World, B.E.l.P and Vortura)
journalists have focused on
what is now one of the mean-
ingless words in music criti-
cism: noise. Masterful feed-
back and distortion led for
comparisons to My Bloody
Valentine, Glen Branca and
(surprise) Sonic Youth. The
comparisons are obviously trite
as well (who hasn’t been influ-
enced by Sonic Youth?), but
put the band in good company.
Like MBV and SY, guitarist
Alastair Parker crafts dense
washes of guitar tone that
weave brilliant melodies and,
on many occasions, erupt into
some of the most sonorous
feedback on wax. However,
this is not dissonant clamor. I’d
have to agree with Option
writer Brad Lips who notes
that, “...Bailter Space capital-
izes on consonance to erect a
monolithic rush of guitar that’s

  
 

ujessetrbuvich

so relentless you can only con-
centrate on the shadings.” The
riffs are huge and dense but
cohesive. Despite the over-
whelming presence of the gui-
tar in the mix, the music is
filled with stark dynamicism.
There are massive rushes of
sound in which the vocals
almost get buried, and con-
trasting lows in which even the
most subtle nuance is easily
detectable. Most impressive,
the band always remains tight.
This is due to the killer rhythm
section comprised of John
Halvorsen on bass and Brent
Mclachlan on drums. Even
when the group gets “experi—
mental”, triggering samples (of
their music) amongst lush
walls of feedback, the band
grooves.

Their new record, Wammo,
is the most focused recording
the group has made to date.
The focus seems to be shifted
from dynamics and atmos-
phere towards well-crafted
songs. Make no mistake,
Bailter Space has always been
a pop band; this time it’s more
pronounced. Tracks like
“Untied,” “Splat” and “Wammo”
are pristine~power-pop gems.
These tunes pack a lot of snap
and are definite toe-tappers.
“D Thing” and “Colours” have a
Velvet Underground-like
chime, and “At Five we Drive”
is a brash driving rocker.
“Voltage” rounds out the
record with spacey rap/eastern
influence. Chalk one up for
Wammo, another impressive
record in Bailter Space’s 10-
plus year career. They are
sure to entertain.

Second on the bill is the
NYC outfit, Run On._This band

Love Child and Fish and

Roses. The band is composed
of Rick Brown on drums, Sue
Garner on vocals and bass,
Alan Licht on guitar and David
Newgarden on organs. I guess
the phrase “idiosyncratic pop”
goes a long way with this
band. They have two EPs to
date, Days Away 7” on Ajax
and On/Off 12” on Matador,
and the music stylings range
from electronic to country.
On/Off, their latest, has five
very different songs. “lnto the
Attic” is funky. A rumbling bass
and chirpy guitars start it off
and the melody takes off with
organ bursts right to the conta-
gious chorus, “Out of the
Closet and into the Attic  
Next, “Switch on” is an ambi-

 

ent guitar/keyboard instrumen-
tal. it has a stiff tempo and a
minor feel. This is contrasted
with “Pretty Note.” A Moog
sputters, the guitar jangles and

 

   

 

eyed country and western
chanteuse. The fourth track is
the rocker. “Water” has a dri-
ving beat and nasty guitar
hook. The final track features
some sparse vocals from
Brown and spooky percussion.
All in all, I think this is a fun
group with some genre-bend-
ing diversity. They’re punchy
and should be interesting live.
Starting the Matador fest is
Six Horse. This is a Pittsburgh
super-trio featuring Pat Morris
on bass (Northern Bushmen,
Don Caballero), and Bill Baxter
on drums (currently in
Blunderbuss, and the Final lris
Co.). and completed with
Shannon Burns on guitar and
vocals. If you missed their set
at the Turmoil Room last
weekend (I just missed ‘em),
then you might not understand
the hype. Several friends chas-
tised me for showing up late.
Father Mike, high priest ofi
punk on WPTS, told me that “it:
was like watching Big
B|ack...amazingl” I’ve yet to
meet anyone who was not
impressed. The group does
have a Chicago Touch and Go
feel. Morris’ basslines are
nasty and pummeling, Burn’s
guitar riffs are angular, searing
and heavily overdriven,
Baxter’s drumming is solid and
heavy. The only recording to
date is a 7" single on Three
Little Girls (Flodan). |t’s better
than most of the new Touch
and Go bands and a must for
fans Shellac, Bitch Magnet and
Pittsburgh’s own, Don
Cabellero. They’re tight as it
gets live, so don’t show up
late! 4

Of Love and Other Demons
By Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Alfred A. Knopf/$21.00

This love story between a
36-year-old protégé to a colo-
nial South American bishop
and a 12-year-old
Rapunzelesque ingenue —
believed to be possessed by
the devil — has its moments.
Marquez is a master story-
teller. Reading his narrative is
like looking at a painting by
Seurat: all detail. But this work
reads more like an adult fairy
tale, and one that I could not
connect with.

Sierva Maria has been mis-
understood all her life. The
product of a loveless marriage,
this daughter of the Marquis
spent most of her days ban-

the company of slaves, practic-
ing their rituals enjoying their
company. That is until she is
bitten by a rabid dog on her
12th birthday. While she
shows no signs of rabies, her
father (in a. surreal change of
heart), sets out to cure the
child. His methods include:
bringing her back, away from
her supportive and loving envi-
ronment, into his household;
tortuous exorcism tonics and,
finally, putting her into the con-
fines of a vengeful convent.
Marquez allows Sierva Maria
her due pity, but it is difficult for
the reader to build up a gen-
uine affection by the point it is
most probably intended. As far
as the development of her
relationship with Delura, I felt
that both were attracted to

th'r6'u'g’h"“pity, as
well: his sympathy for the way
a beautiful, mysterious girl
was treated, and her sympa-
thy for his feelings for her.
This isn’t exactly the founda-
tions of a relationship to read
and admire. And this is com-
pletely aside from the fact that
his Humbert-like attraction to
her pre—pubescent body
detracts from the readers’ sen-
sitivity for any serious emo-
tional connection between
them.

Marquez’s simple, lyrical
voice is spellbinding. He is
experimental and unique, and
for that, l truly admire the man.
And if that is the only reason
you choose to read this book,
you will probably be satisfied.
On the whole, I found it tiring.
The only way I can describe it
adequately is in terms of a
painting. It's wild to look at, to
turn over and over in your
mind, but the blandly sadistic,
unfocused story —— which I
would have liked to have read
if it centered on only one of
the main characters — moves
slower than a velvet Elvis
painting at a charity auction.

Knoxville's
Cinderella

Story ,

he next-
Guest . best
Colummst thing to

Kevin being the home
Kramer team in any

tournament is
being the Cinderella team. So,
when the Pitt baseball team
ﬂew down to Knoxville,
Tenn., for the Mideast regional
for the first time ever, there
probably wasn’t another team
in the country with a better

, Cinderella story than ours.

Heading to the Big East
playoffs as the No. 4 seed (out
of four teams), the chances of
winning a game, let alone the
championship, were beyond
comprehension.

While the other three teams
all had pitchers who threw 90
miles per hour and hitters who
hit 400-foot home runs, we
had a bunch of players with
little expectation, but a lot of
heart.

The heart proved to be
mightier than the talent, as we
rallied back from a seven-run
deficit against Seton Hall in
the ninth inning (which result-
ed in the much-awaited elimi-
nation of Coach Jackson’s
mustache). Then we went on
to beat mighty Providence,
which resulted in one of the
greatest post-game pile-ups of
all time.

A few days later, we sat
glossy-eyed in the Pitt football
stadium and watched the
regional pairings on ESPN.
When the announcer said that
he’d hate to be the pitching
staff that had to face the
Oklahoma State offense, we
all just kind of laughed
because it was a miracle just
making it to the regionals.

So we went down to
Tennessee with the attitude
that we wanted to enjoy the
time while it lasted and not get
embarrassed in the meantime.

The only real embarrass-
ment, however, came prior to
the games. The first time was
when we showed up early for
practice on the Volunteer field
and found Georgia Tech tak-
ing batting practice in their
crisp practice uniforms.

With some of us dressed in
an assortment of colored Pitt
shorts, some dressed in baggy
sweat pants and one player
dressed in khakis, we got the
feeling that we wouldn’t be
allowed on the field because
of our mismatched wardrobe.

But with the tournament
committee realizing that these
formalities were all new to a
team that had never even
come close to being at a
regional tournament, they
allowed us onto the field and
the hitters proceeded to take
batting practice while the
pitchers shagged ﬂies. With

Pitt's Ruben Brown walks away from a 5-year
Pitt career and into Buffalo Bills territory after
signing a contract worth a reported $5.65 mil-

lion over the next five years.

' Brown signs

The Pitt News
Wednesday June 28, 1995

with Bills  

, By Brad Isles
 Sports Editor

The waiting is the hardest part

V for prospective first—rounders in
::_E the NFL draft.

For instance, there is Warren

'4 Sapp, who was projected as the
 number one pick overall, but fell
~ to 12th after reports of several

failed drug tests. Sapp, visibly
upset and disgruntled, sat listening
to his counterparts’ names being
called out by Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue, until the Tampa Bay

'Buccaneers put his misery to rest.

Sapp, eager to put his critics to
rest, was the first player to sign
after the draft.

The waiting also ended early in

I it the draft for Pitt’s All-American

offensive tackle Ruben Brown, as
the Buffalo Bills selected him
with the 14th pick overall.

Now, the waiting is over for the
Bills after Brown signed a con-
tract last week ‘worth a reported
$5.65 million over five years.

Brown, all 6—feet-3-inches and
305 pounds of him, was the sec-
ond offensive lineman taken in the

 draft. Southern Cal’s mammoth,

Tony Boselli, was taken second by

Olsavsky. “I told him, ‘it’s fun
now, you get to make money and
play football and that’s all you’ve
got to worry about.”’

Brown came to Pitt from
Lynchburg, Va., where he was
voted as 1989-90 most valuable
defensive lineman and the 1990
Virginia Male Athlete of the Year.

He started out at defensive end,
playing the first two games, but
had to be redshirted after an ankle
injury.

In the 1991 season, he was
switched to offensive tackle and
was selected to the Football
News’ third-team freshman All-
American team.

The accolades kept pouring in
after his ‘92 and ‘93 campaigns,
andcoming into the ‘94 season,
Brown established himself as the
best offensive lineman in the East.

He missed three games last sea-
son due to a wrist injury, and con-
tinued the season with a protective
cast on his hand.

Evoking memories of “The
Fridge,” coach Johnny Majors
used Brown in the backfield as a
blocking back in short yardage sit-
uations. Brown even got the call
on one play, gaining four yards.

The Pitt News peeks
at NBA Draft Lottery

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Thanks to the increasing
upward trend of underclass—
men declaring themselves eli-
gible, this Wednesday’s NBA
draft could have the deepest
class in a decade. But while
this year’s draft is extremely
rich from top to bottom,
don’t count on a lot of future
all-stars to be born like last
yean

Although it’s hard to pre-
dict draft day trades and what
not, The Pitt News takes a a
shot at the NBA’s lottery
selections.

1.) Philadelphia (from
Golden State): The 76ers,
who hold the third pick,
might trade up to get the
Warriors’ first pick to make
sure they get North
Carolina’s super-sophomore
Jerry Stackhouse. Although
Golden State needs another
swingman like it needs
another injury, the Clippers,
who hold the second pick,
would have undoubtedly
selected the 6-foot—6 All-
American guard/forward. The
Sixers desperately need a
scorer, and Stackhouse is the
best scorer in the draft. The
trade, however, will be void
if Golden State decides to

trade the disgruntled Latrell
Sprewell.

2.) L.A. Clippers:
Maryland’s lanky Joe Smith
is the logical selection. The
Clippers need help every-
where, and Smith, at 6-9,
does a tad of everything. If
the Philly—Golden State trade
falls through, the Clips could
find themselves with
Stackhouse and Smith will go
No.1.

3.) Golden State (from
Philadelphia): The Warriors
make out big on this trade.
Golden State needs to solidi-
fy the power forward slot.
Luckily for them, this draft
features an influx of power
forwards. It’s a tough call,
but the Warriors will take
Rasheed Wallace. The 6-10
sophomore from UNC fits
perfectly in the Warriors'run-
and-gun system —— he’s
incredibly athletic, but he has
nothing that resembles a
perimeter game. Plus,
because of the trade, the
Warriors will get something
from Philadelphia — perhaps
Sharone Wright.

4.) Washington: The
Bullets are in a tough situa-
tion. They have their forward‘
slots shored up with Chris
Webber and Juwan Howard,

fbackyard brawl

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Who needs Pitt—Penn State? We’ve got Pitt-Duquesne.

The city rivalry has been picking up steam over the past
couple of years, and now it’s getting even better. Last
week, Pitt announced the contest will be officially called
The City Game, and a doubleheader will be played featur-
ing both the men’s and women’s squads.

“I am looking forward to this event as much for what it
will mean to the community as for the game itself,” said
Panther head coach Ralph Willard in a press release.

A portion of each ticket sold for the game will go to
Dapper Dan Charities, a local group that raises money for
Pittsburgh youth. The money from games will go to the
Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania, according
to Bruce Keidan, president of Dapper Dan Charities.

Pitt Athletic Director Oval J aynes said he hopes every-
body comes out and gets involved.

“This is a way we can showcase both of our programs,
and at the same time we can.support Dapper Dan chari-
ties, which is one of the greatest organizations in
Pittsburgh,” Jaynes said.

Newly hired Duquesne hoops coach Scott Edgar is also
looking forward to the game.

“These games will be very good for Duquesne
University, for Pitt and for our community,” Edgar said.

“I’m sure both teams will play really well, and it will be
a meaningful game for the people of Pittsburgh." added
Jaynes.

The games are scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 29, at the
Civic Arena .

Draft

-From page 9
but the draft’s top talent are all
forwards. Washington needs an
injection of excitement, and
what better answer to the
Bullets’ ﬂailing ticket problems
than Kevin Garnett? Garnett, a
6-10 all—everything teen fresh
out of high school, thinks he’s
ready to hang with the big boys
-- and apparently NBA scouts

- feel the same way. Selecting

Garnett is a gamble, but in the
long run, that gamble will pay

_ huge dividends in more than
 one way. However, there are
 talks that the Bullets might
T trade their pick to the Pistons.

5.) Minnesota: Oh, those

3 poor, dreadful T-Wolves. What
1 do they have to do to win?
1 Antonio
 Alabama might be the answer.
0 Another sophomore, McDyess’

McDyess from

V  6-1'0 frame and playing style

Rasheed Wallace from North Carolina is likely to be a
top five pick in tonight's NBA Draft. '.

 

, has been compared to Karl
 Malone. Golden State was

heavily looking at McDyess,
but he reportedly had a horrible
tryout.

6.) Vancouver: This is a piv-

otal selection for the expansion
Grizzlies. They need someone
who can step up and make an
instant contribution. That’s
when it finally pays off to be a
senior like Ed O’Bannon.
O’Bannon, UCLA’s 6-8 All-
American and Final Four MVP,
can do it all. But will his ques-
tionable knee that underwent
reconstructive surgery his
freshman year hold up in the
NBA’s rigorous 82-game sched-
ule?

7.) Toronto: He ain’t pretty.
He ain’t graceful. And he cer-
tainly ain’t a marketing man for
the expansion Raptors. But he’s
big and strong with a good
touch. Bryant “Big Country”
Reeves, all 7—feet and 292
pounds, can be a stabilizing
force in the middle for years to
come. '

8.) Portland (from Detroit):
The Trail Blazers, who are
rebuilding, traded their 18th
and 19th selections in the first
round and the 58th pick in the
second. The Blazers have a log-
jam at the power forward slot,

so Corliss Williamson will con-
tinue to drop. They need to look
for a two—guard who can score,
and Michigan State’s Shawn
Respert is the man. The Big
Ten’s second all-time leading
scorer definitely knows how to
put the ball in the hole, but
NBA scouts are questioning his
ball-handling skills.

9.) New Jersey: The first
thing the Nets need _to do is get
rid of head coach Butch Beard.
Next, they need to land a shoot-
er/scorer to run with Kenny
Anderson. That’s why
Portland’s trade for the eighth
pick really screwed them. The
Nets have been desperately
looking to fill the void left by
Drazen Petrovic’s death.
Respert was their man. This
could be GM Willis Reed’s
chance to deal the problematic
Derrick Coleman if they take
Arkansas’ Corliss Williamson.
He’s the best player left, so it
might be his only choice.

10.) Miami: The Heat need a
point guard, but chances are
they will look to solidify the
middle. At. 6-10, Cherokee

‘From page 9

the manicured outfield grass looking
and feeling like a U.S. Open putting
green, we practiced with an excitement
and naiveté that made it seem as though
we were a Little League team playing
on opening day.

The only other embarrassing moment
came directly before the opening game,
when the announcer said, “Now, the
starting line-up for the Pittsburgh
Pirates.”

But when the games started, and
when we realized that the players on the
other teams had the same fears and
made the same mistakes as we did, we
played almost like we had been there
for years.

And looking back, the biggest differ-

ence between playing a Big East team
at Trees Field and playing Oklahoma
State in Lindsey Nelson Stadium was
not so much the level of competition
but the 2,000 fans, the Gatorade in the
dugout and the ball girls chasing after
fouls.

Because we were the scrappy
Cinderella team from up-north that beat
The Citadel and California and twice
came close to beating Cowboys from
Oklahoma State, and thanks to Johnny
Majors for winning all those games as
the head coach at Tennessee, the fans
absolutely loved us.

In the end, Teddy Campbell (who
held the most potent offensive team in
the country in check for eight innings
while pitching with what looked liked a

broken back), the coaching staff and the
entire team got the respect that we right-
fully deserved.

Sure, the two guys from Oklahoma
State who hit back—to-back home runs
against me in the second game may
someday play on a major league team.
But when I (and the rest of the team)
stood on the roof of our Knoxville
Tours charter bus and watched
Tennessee beat Oklahoma State in the
final game in front on 5,000 raving fans,
I still think there was more pride and
happiness on the roof of that bus than
anywhere else in Lindsey Nelson Field.

Tom Bresnaban, the Bills’ offensive line
coach had high remarks for Brown after
the Senior Bowl, saying that he was "clear—

The Bills have projected Brown as a
guard next season, instead of a tackle.

“I’m what you call a football player,”
Brown told The Buffalo News in April.
“Whatever they ask me to play, I play it
and try to play it as well as I can.

“That’s what I want to do [play guard],
