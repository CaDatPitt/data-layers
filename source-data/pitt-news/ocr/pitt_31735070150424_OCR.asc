Sandusky sentenced
to at least 30 years

Paula Reed Ward
Pzﬁsburgh Post— Gazette
(MCT Campus)

Less than a day after Jerry San-
dusky gave a statement in which
he continued to proclaim his in-
nocence and blame others for

his conviction on 45 child sex

abuse charges, the former Penn
State University assistant football
coach was sentenced to between
30 and 60 years in prison. '

“That has the unmistakable ef-
fect of saying you will spend the
rest of your life in prison,” Senior
Judge John Cleland said.

Sandusky will remain at the
Centre County Correctional Facil-
ity for 10 days before being trans-
ported to state prison.

His attorney, Joe Amendola,
has said his client would like to be
placed in a general population.

Sandusky spoke for 15 min-
utes, repeating much of a state-
ment released Monday on a Penn
State student radio station. '’

“Others can take my life and
make me out as a monster,” San-
dusky, said. “They can’t take away
my heart. In my heart I know I did
not do these alleged, disgusting
acts.” _ .

He questioned how his convic-
tion occurred and said often that
he continues to have hope and
that the truth will eventually come
out. ’ =

“We’re starting the fourth
quarter now,” he said.

He became emotional only
when talking about his family
standing by him, and how unbear-
able his life would become if that
were to stop. ‘

“You ﬁnd out who’s committed,
who will stand by you,” Sandusky
said.

Three of Sandusky’s victims

read statements, and_Senior Dep-
uty Attorney General Joe McGet-
tigan read one from another and
from the mother of.0ne more.

The prosecution did not make

any request for a speciﬁc sentence. .

“He will complain‘ there wasn’t
time enough to prove his inno-
cence,” McGettigan said. “There’s

not time enough in the world for
him to prove that lie.” '

I

Sandusky was the only one to
speak on-his behalf. He called no
witnesses, although a number of
letters in support had previously
been submitted to Judge Cleland.

Penn State president Rodney
Erickson issued a statement via
email after the sentencing.

“Our thoughts today, as they
have been for the last year, go out
to the victims of Jerry Sandusky’s
abuse,” Erickson said in the state-

'ment.- “While today’s sentence

cannot erase what has happened,
hopefully it will provide comfort
to those affected by these horrible
events and help them continue
down the road to recovery.”

Gov. Tom Corbett, who as at-
torney general supervised the
early stages of the investigation,
released his own statement this
afternoon. ' A

“These cases are difficult in the
best of circumstances,” Corbett
said in his statement. “It is to the
credit of these investigators, along
with the resilience of the victims,
resulting in an airtight case, the
conviction of 45 crimes — and
now, today’s sentence.” ,

Investigators and prosecutors
weren’t the only people the gover-
nor mentioned. .

“I want to especially commend

the victims in the case, ‘who had

ELECTION 2012

Professors use presidential election
a year as a teaching tool in classes

Joe Chilson
. Stcyff Wrz'ter

It’s election season, and all across

campus students and professors
are getting into the holiday spirit.

The presidential election is
creeping into Pitt classrooms this
month, both as a teaching tool for
professors and as an issue of inter-
est for students.

Gerald Shuster, who teaches in
the communications department,
requires his Political Communica-
tion class to volunteer for at least
one campaign this fall, presidential
or otherwise.

“How often in a class can you
get people to test the theory against
the real thing?” Shuster asked.

Though Shuster only requires
15 hours of volunteer work for his
class, he said that when he did this
exercise in the past, more than half

of the students ended up signing
up for more hours, some doing as
many as 100.

Shuster says requiring his class

‘ to get out into the political process

teaches them the real—world skills
that the class doesn’t offer. ‘

“I want them to be familiar
enough with the process to speak
intelligently about it,” Shuster said.

But he also thinks the experi-
ence goes beyond the goals of the
classroom.

“It takes them out of the realm
of being complacent,” Shuster said.

Polls indicate that the race be-
tween President Barack Obama
and Republican presidential nomi-
nee Mitt Romney will be a close
one. The two candidates, vying for
votes on Nov. 6, will participate in
their second televised debate on
Oct. 16.

Other professors, who can’t

devote their whole class to study-
ing this year’s election, try to work
it into the instruction where they
can.

Professor Jon Hurwitz, who
teaches politicalpsychology in the
political science department, said
he tries to take a few minutes in the
beginning of class once or twice a
weeklto discuss what’s happening
in the election with his students.

Last week, professor Hurwitz
asked his class to watch the presi-
dential debate so that they could
discuss it.

“An election comes once every
four years,” Hurvvitz said. “To not
talk about it in a political science
course is a lost opportunity.”

The momentum can ﬂow in the
other direction, as well, when stu-

dents push to get their professors

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGB focuses meeti
national, Board ele

Megan Trimble
° Stcyff Writer

Two Board members were absent as
the Student Government Board met
Tuesday night, leaving the remain-
ing seven to discuss the upcoming
homecoming events on campus and
the national and SGB elections.
Board Presidentjames Landre~
neau announced to about 20 people

V gathered in Nordy’s Place that the

Board is ofﬁcially endorsing Board
members Alex Murdoch and Olivia
Armstrong, who could not attend
the public meeting because they
were at Meet the Candidates event
for homecoming, in their bids for
homecoming court.

Board member Gordon Louder-

‘ back took the opportunity to reiter-

g on
ions

ate Land_reneau’s endorsement, and
to remind students of homecoming
events on campus, as well as a spe-

cial halftime presentation during ‘

Saturday’s football game against

Louisville. Louderback urged Stu- —

dent Alumni Association members
to sign up through the SSA web-
site for halftime ﬁeld access to sing
happy birthday to the University.
“Everyone get excited, because
it’s going to be a very long and fun

weekend for homecoming,” Loud-

erback said.

Landreneau outlined SGB’s pres.-
idential election plans, announcing
that they will hold their ﬁrst student
watch party for the vice presidential
‘debate Thursday, Oct. 11, at 8:45
p.rn. in Nordy’s Place. He encour-

the courage to come forward and,
testify in open‘ court, in spite of
tremendous pressure and nation-
al publicity,” Corbett said in his
statement. _ '
In Sandusky’s radio statement
Monday, the former coach contin— _
ued to declare his innocence and
blamed his conviction on a vast

’ conspiracy.

“A young man who is dramatic
anda veteran accuser and always
sought attention started every-
thing,” hesaid in the statement.
“He was joined by a well—orches-
trated effort of the media, inves-
tigators, the system, Penn State,
psychologists, civil attorneys and
other accusers. They won. I’ve
wondered what they really won.
Attention, ﬁnancial gain, prestige
will all be temporary.” *

Even having said that, this
morning Sandusky admitted fond
thoughts for his accusers.

“These are people I cared

about and still do,” he said.

McGettigan called the radio
statement “an insul .” '

“It is an insult to human de-
cency,” he said. “jI‘he defendant
was and is the most insidious of
criminals.”..

Courtroom No. 1 was largely
packed by 8:30 a.m..

Sandusky’s wife, Dottie, en-
tered the room at 8:49 a.m., fol-
lowed eight minutes later by the
victims and their families. , I

Sandusky entered with his de-
fense team at 8:58 a.m., wearing
a red jail jumpsuit stamped with
“Centre County” on the back. He
appeared to be ‘much thinner than
during his trial.

A jury found Sandusky guilty
on all but three of 48 counts in
June following a two-week trial
beforejudge Cleland.

The most serious among them
were involuntary deviate sexual
intercourse, indecent assault and
endangering the welfare of chil-
dren. _

Prosecutors with "the Penn-
sylvania attorney general’s office

accused Sandusky of abusing 10
boys across 15 years, sometimes
in Penn State facilities.

His conviction included counts
related to all 10.

In the months leading up to tri-
al, McGettigan called Sandusky’s
charity for youth, The Second
Mile, “a victim factory.”

In the months ‘since being
found guilty, Sandusky has re-
mained in the Centre County Cor-
rectional Facility in segregation.

Sandusky said he spends his
time in jail reading, meditating,
writing and exercising.

While the Sandusky criminal
case has concluded —— although he
has said he will appeal -— prosecu-
tors are now gearing up to try two
former Penn State administrators
for perjury, accusing them of lying

.to a grand jury about their knowl-
edge of the accusations against
Sandusky.

Athletic director Tim Curley
and retired senior vice presi-
dent for ﬁnance Gary Schultz are
scheduled for trial Jan. 7 in Har-
risburg. I

involved.

Senior Chris Wilson has been on a cam-
paign of his own this semester. Wilson is try-
ing to convince as many professors as he can
to be lenient on election day absences to en-

' sure that students have time to go to the polls.

Wilson’s crusade began over the sum-
mer, when he and his friends wondered why
voter tumout among young people is usu-
ally so low. When Chris began to talk to other
people around campus about the issue, most
students told him they’d like to vote but don’t
have the time because of their course sched-
ule.

“You can sometimes stand in line for a

They just wouldn’t be able to do it,” Wilson
said.

So Chris began to email Pitt’s depart-
ment heads, asking them to ask their faculty
to grant students clemency on election day.

He was disappointed he didn’t get many re- _

sponses, but the professors he did speak with
were very supportive.

A University representative did not re-
spond to multiple requests for comment on

commodating students who miss classes to

aged students to attend even if they aren’t
politically active, adding that future events
will include another student watch party for
the ﬁnal presidential debate on Oct. 27 and a
ﬁnal results watch party. ,

“It will not be political, besides watching
the debates" on the TV screen. We won’t be
arguing or anything,” Landreneau said.

Board member Halim Genus said the spe-

ciﬁc voting locations within the William Pitt
Union for registered students residing in the
Litchﬁeld Towers or the Schenley Quad are
still under discussion, but that the combina-
tion will most likely include the Ballroom and
Assembly room.
' Upcoming elections discussion turned to
the SGB election taking place on Nov. 15, as
the Judicial Committee introduced a voting
referendum to the audience.

An identical version of the referendum,
which proposed that students would have the
ability to vote for eight Board members and
a president —— instead of ﬁve members and
a president, as it currently stands — was
rejected by the previous Board last year.

Within the reintroduced referendum, the
Judicial Committee argued that “students at
the University should be allowed to put to-
gether a vote that consists of a Board that they
ﬁnd to personally meet their needs?’

The Board chose to table the referendum,
which will be put to a vote next meeting, but
Landreneau stressed its timeliness.

COLUMN
' Redistribution of income is not socialism:

It’s a necessary part of capitalism

Daniel Okwaisie
Columnist

Most times-that a pundit gets on
TV to argue that the president is
a socialist, the stock market index
is scrolling across the bottom of
the screen. What the pundit often
doesn’t realize is that the presi-
den ’s “socialist” pro—government
policies that they are criticizing are
what actually keep the bottom of
the screen moving.

Aside from ignoringthe fact that

— a real socialist government wouldn’t

allow a freely moving stock market
(much less one reaching historic
highs), the pundits, and indeed
many normal citizens, don’t re-
alize that because of capitalism’s
tendency to enrich the owner sig-
niﬁcantly more than the worker,
the president’s light redistribution
and progressive taxation is exactly
what is needed to save capitalism.
This light redistribution is not
socialism; real socialists hate wel-
fare. They disdain the idea of a
manufactured safety net or artiﬁcial
government support for the work-
ing class.-In fact, Karl Marx, the
infamous founder of the socialist
school of thought, considered such
practices to be petty charity, not ad-

. dressing the core issues of capital-

ism. These light payments are just
like trying to patch up a broken jar
with tape instead of throwing it out
and getting a new one. To them, the
tape helps keep an ugly broken jar
around longer.

While hardly ever discussed to-

day, Marx actually wrote one of the '

most rousing and accurate critiques

of capitalism. His assessment of it
was spot-on. He praised capitalism
for overthrowing the feudal sys-
tem, a system in which your place
in life was cemented by virtue of

, birth. If yoii were born to an elite

class, you remained elite for life,
regardless of how inept or oblivi-
ous you were, and likewise, if you
were born a peasant, you stayed
so, regardless of your industrious-
ness. Capitalism, with its ruthless

_ pursuit of proﬁt, tore down these

societal barriers and wrought an
explosion of ingenuity and technol-
ogy never seen before in the history
of mankind.

However, this inherent charac-
teristic is what makes capitalism
unsustainable without redistribu-
tion. Pure capitalism is unsustain-
able because of the way it distrib-
utes the proceeds. Because your
boss doesn’t pay you the same sal-
ary he takes home, he becomes sig-
niﬁcantly wealthierwith every addi-
tional unit sold or service provided.
In the short term, the worker might
be just pleased enough to at least
be earning asalary or wage, but as
things naturally get more expensive
over time, it becomes apparent that
this situation is untenable.

The reason why redistribution
is a necessary essence of capitalism

is because of this inevitable collec- V

tion of wealth within the capitalist
class. In an attempt to solve this
problem, pure free—market capital-
ists — like the pundits who show
up on TV these days — point out
that any worker can also save up
and become an owner of a business
himself. This is theoretically true,

but it is painfully devoid of reality.
We cannot all become capitalists
at the same time. If we all become
owners, who will work for us?

So even if some workers make
the transition to owner, it is obvious
that there will always be workers.
Thus, without some redistribution
of beneﬁts, the capitalist is essen-
tially promoting the creation of a
sort of permanent underclass, akin
to what existed in the feudal society.

Marx predicted that this ten-
dency for capitalists and owners
to keep taking more and more of
the proﬁts for themselves would
lead to the fall of capitalism, as the
working class — who he argued
worked harder to create the prod-
uct — got fed up with it. Therefore,
any form of assistance, government
programs or welfare that helps out
working—class folks only delays or
prevents the overthrow of capital-
ism. Interestingly, Marx never gave
a clear description of what capital-
ism would be replaced by. And as a
result, Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev
and co. ﬁnished the theory for him.

‘They seized power and with the

most oppressive brutality, tried to
equalize society in Marx’s name.
Most free—market advocates
don’t realize that by campaigning
vociferously against the safety net,
worker compensation and other
government aid for the working
class, they are helping to bring
Marx’s prediction to fruition. They
do so in the name of preventing
socialism, but in reality, they are
simply attacking capitalism’s best
hope for long term continuation.

Draw at St. John’s elirninates Pitt from Big East contention

Donnie Tasser
Stcyj” Wrz'ter

Time has run out for the Pitt wom-
en’s soccerlteam.

Going into the last road trip of
the regular season, the Panthers sat
in last place in the Big East’s Ameri-
can Division in desperate need of
points to qualify for the conference
tournament.

But after falling 2-0 to Syracuse
and tying St._]ohn’s 2-2, Pitt (5-10-2,
0-6-2 in Big East) will fail to make
the Big East tournament for the sec-
ond consecutive year.

“As of Sunday, we are mathemat-
ically eliminated,” Pitt head coach
Greg Miller said. “Had we won on
Sunday, we would have needed to
win out and received some help in
the form of other teams losing.”

Miller said the Panthers now
simply want to ﬁnish the season
well for the seniors.

“Now, going into the last home
series — one of which is Senior Day,
on Sunday — we are only playing
for pride and for our seniors so we
can see them out on a strong note.”

After a disastrous pair of home
games two weekends ago that saw
Pitt outscored by a combined 10-1
against Villanova and No. 11 George-
town, the Panthers showed marked
improvement, losing a hard-fought
game against Syracuse and giving up
a second—ha_lf lead to tie St. john’s.

“Our soccer was deﬁnitely bet-
ter, and the coaches were much

  SPORTS

more pleased with our play, work
ethic and intensity,” junior Katie
Lippert said, “but it’s frustrating,
because we needed to win. We re-
ally needed the standings points,
because the season is almost over.”

Senior Ashley Cuba also ex-
pressed her frustration with the
season.

“This season has been really try-
ing, really frustrating, because it’s
only that much more that we need,”
Cuba said. “Everything has just felt
unlucky.»They say that you’re sup-
posed to make your own luck, but
still it seemed that whenever some-

thing could go wrong, it did for most a‘

of the year.” '
Syracuse 2, Pittsburgh 0
; Syracuse (8-4-2, 5-1-1 in Big East)

entered the match on a three-game P‘
winning streak, but for much of the

game was unable‘ to ﬁnd the net

against the Panthers.

The Orange outshot Pitt 22-5 in
the game, but were only able to hit
the net with six shots, and the score
remained tied for 76 minutes.

“We had the pressure on them
early,” ju_nior Danielle Benner said.
“We were controlling the game and
had a missed breakaway. We just
didn’t put away our chances.”

The winning goal was scored
in the 77th minute, when a Syra-
cuse cross hit a Pitt defender and '
deﬂected right to Erin Simon, who
ﬁnished. The Orange were able to

tournament. Huailei Wang | Senior Staff Photographer

score theclincher on a breakaway
with about four minutes to play, tak-
ing advantage of Pitt’s aggressive
formation.

“They got up by a goal late in the
game and we had to keep the pres-
sure on,” Benner said. “We brought
everybody up, trying to manufac-
ture a goal and they were able to
score in that desperation scenario.”

St. John’s 2, Pittsburgh 2 (2OT)

On Sunday, Pitt found itself in an

early hole after St. John’s scored in ' S

the 11th minute, but the Panthers
responded with two unassisted

- goals by freshman Roosa Arvas in

a seven-minute span.

In the 21st minute, Arvas stole
the ball from a defender and con-
ﬁdently ﬁnished to level the score.

A few minutes later, she took
advantage of a St. John’s turnover,
collected the ball and ﬁred it into the
net for her second goal of the game.

St.John’s would score in the ﬁrst

I minute of the second half, and the

score remained tied at 2-2 for the
rest of regulation and both overtime
periods. ’' ’

“Against St. John’s, we stuck
with the same mindset and tactics
as Thursday,” Miller said. “We gave
up a silly goal early, but for once, the
other team was making the mistakes
and Roosa was able to capitalize big.

.I thought it was our game — ev-

erything was ﬁnally bouncing our

way. But then we had a breakdown, H

The Pitt men’s soccer team contin-
ues to struggle in its last.season in
the Big East.

Still winless in conference
play, the Panthers have been out-
scored 15-3 in their last four Big
East games. .

Following a 7-1 loss to Notre
Dame last week, Pitt (6-5-2, 0-4
Big East) was hopeful heading into
last Saturday’s contest against Se-
ton Hall (6-5, 2-1 Big East).

However, the Panthers’ conﬁ-
dence took another hit as Pitt lost
4-1 to Seton Hall, giving up all four
goals in the first half.

Striker George Velasquez
scored the ﬁrst goal of the game
just four minutes in for the Pirates.
After receiving-a pass from Max
Garcia, Velasquez ﬁred a low driv-
ing shot from 20 yards out that

was able to get past Pitt goalie Lee

Johnston. .

After the goal, the Pirates tal-
lied two more within ﬁve minutes.

Facing a three-goal deﬁcit,
the Panthers knew they needed
to score quickly if they wanted to
have any chance in the match.-

And Pitt would get a goal when
junior co—captain Alex Harrison

ﬁred a shot from 45 yards out that V

Seton Hall goalie Kevin Bonder was
unable to save. . ‘ '

But after the goal, Pitt was un-
able to maintain any momentum,
conceding once again to Seton
Hall.’ ' '

Garcia sent a perfect ball to
John Gurel, who restored the Pi-
rates’ four—goal advantage.

The rest of the game, Pitt’s

play improved, but the damage »

was already done. The Panthers
were unable to get back into the
match, ultimately suffering their
ﬁfth consecutive defeat.

TASSER’S TAKE

Choosing which team to root for in MLB playoffs no easy task

Donnie Tasser
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

Featuring a refreshing variety of new and old
teams this October and the addition of the
exciting one-game Wild Card, Major League
Baseball’s postseason is as exciting as ever.
With the Pirates once again not in the play-
offs, I look forward to this time of year for all of

‘the bandwagon-jumping opportunities.

I get to root enthusiastically for a team,
take pride in their victories and suffer no pain
upon their defeats.

I’ll admit that baseball, at its worst, can be
time—consuming and boring with a lot of dead
time. But during the playoffs, every pitch is rife
with excitement, adrenaline, emotion and all of
the other romanticized feelings and sensations
that sports are said to provide.

So if you’re like me, you need to ﬁnd a team
to root for. And lucky for you, I will use my
knowledge of postseason baseball bandwagon-
ing —— all 20 years of experience —_ to handi-
cap the teams, allowing you to pick your new
favorite ball club.

Atlanta Braves

I have three good reasons to root for the
Braves: Chipperjones, Chipperjones and Chip-

‘ perjones. That’s it.

Wait, they’re eliminated already? Never
mind then. s '
Texas Rangers

i:]Mylan  

i"HF.${Yi'!U} BY 

They’re gone, too. Aren’t one-game playoffs
exciting?

St. Louis Cardinals

I will admit that I jumpedall over the Car-
dinals’ bandwagon last season.

There was just something about Albert
Pujols, David Freese and the rest of the team’s
sizzling-hot ﬁnish to snatch the Wild Card
on the last day of the season and subsequent
march to the World Series that just won over

my little heart.

Because the Cardinals are the returning
World Series champs, choosing St. Louis as a
bandwagon team is a no—win situation — even
fellow bandwagonerswill look down on you for
choosing the returning champion.

Washington Nationals

This season, the Nationals made the play-
offs, meaning a team from the nation’s capital
will be in the playoffs for the ﬁrst time since

1933- ’
The Nationals have evolved into a model
franchise: a smaller—market team succeeding

based on smart personnel moves that brought '

in aninﬂux ofyoungtalent and is lookingto stay
in the spotlight for many more years.

For that reason, I’m staying away from
them. I would like to let my jealousy develop
to apoint where I can hate them for being good
down the line, in that cynical Pirate—fan kind
of way. _ ~

San Francisco Giants

The Giants have potential as a bandwagon
team, based on their quality players — Buster
Posey, Hunter Pence, Pablo Sandoval, Matt
Cain and Tim Lincecum —— and because they
beat the big—spending Los Angeles Dodgers for
the West Division title.

But San Francisco is already facing elimi-
nation, and all of those likeable players may
already be on the golf course by the time you
read this. While it is easy to pick a new team —
that’s the beauty ofbandwagon—jumping —— you
don’t want to appear like a super bandwagon
jumper or anything.

Cincinnati Reds

Hate ‘em, hate ‘em, hate ‘em.

They beat the Pirates, are loaded with tal-
ent, will be good for several years and they
beat the Pirates.

I will now stare enviously at this franchise,
secretly hope that Cuban defectee Aroldis
Chapman gets abducted by Cuban spies and
mutter about how much I hate Brandon Phillips.

Oakland Athletics

You should root for this team simply be-
cause of its general manager. '

Billy Beane is abaseball genius — check out ‘
“Moneyball” if you don’t believe me — and I
really want to see him actually win something
of relevance.

This team won the American League West
division withasalary $8 millionless than the Pi-
rates, beatingthe Rangers and the Los Angeles

Angels of Anaheim, who both had signiﬁcantly
higher salaries.

Unfortunately, like_.the Giants, the A’s may
be eliminated by the time you read this.

Detroit Tigers ’

The Tigers have some solid Pittsburgh con-
nections, which make them a possible band-
wagon selection: Manager Jim Leyland and
his mustache formerly managed the Pirates
the last time they actually made the playoffs
and light—hitting utility man Don Kelly — a
Pittsburgh native who is married to Pirates’
second baseman Neil Walker’s sister — has a
knack for coming through  the postseason
for the Tigers.

Detroit’s best hitter, Miguel Cabrera, also
won the Triple Crown this year, leading the
league in batting average, home runs and runs

1967. So that’s cool.

On top of everything, how can you possi-
bly hate Detroit? Ever seen “8 Mile,” starring
Eminem? That place deserves some pity from
everyone. —

Baltimore Orioles

For the longest time, whenever I felt down
about my baseball team, I could count on a
select few other franchises to brighten my day.

The Orioles were always one of those teams,
seemingly mired in irrelevance in a ridiculously
difﬁcult division.

Then — boom —. this year, they are magi-
cally awesome. A

I now hate them for depriving me of an or-
ganization to look down upon. Plus, there’s
no way I’m rooting for a team from Baltimore.

New York Yankees

If you jump on the New York Yankees band-
wagon, congratulations, you might be the scum
of the Earth. - — y _

Jumping on the bandwagon of the richest,
most successﬁll franchise with the most obnox-
ious fans is like giving your track—star friend a

50-yard head start and then telling him to race ‘

your little sister as you loudly yell how you re-

ally hope your friend wins and how much your

little sister sucks. ' .
OK, so maybe that analogy didn’t make

sense. But neither does rootingfor the Yankees.

“As a senior, [being eliminated] obviously
really puts a damper on the season,” she said.
