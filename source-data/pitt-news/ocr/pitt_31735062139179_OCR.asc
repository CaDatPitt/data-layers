At a meeting of the Alumni Coun-
cil, held Monday evening in room 302

. Thaw Hall, Mr. R. A. McKean, C. l:..,

suing year. Mr. McKean has for
many years actively interested him-
self in Alumni matters. He was a
member of the special committee

.which ‘did so much to make the one ~

trict and is at present associated with
the Jones & Laugh]-in Steel Co. We

WHAT WOULD BAN

JOHNSON SAY?

Word has been received that the
head of the American "League has de-
cided that the members of any team
in that league will not.be permitted
to write baseball dope for the news-
papers. _It has become the fad of
late years for all the newspapers in
the country to ‘have an articleanow
and again by Ty Cob-b,~ Christy
Mathewson, Chief Meyers, Joe Wood
or some other celebrity oftheidiamond.
As a matter of fact, most of the dope
that comes out with the signature of
some baseball player attached to the
article is written by the sporting
editor and the plgyer -comes into, the
game only by reason- of the fact that
he gets so, much per issue for allow-
ing ‘his name to appear above or be-
low the dopeithat is written by.the
editor of the sporting page. Ban
Johnson believes that every man
should stick to his own line of ‘work
and that the sportingeditor should
take care of all the sporting news’, and
that.the players should take car‘; of
the playing end of baseball and stay
out of the newspaper game, of which
they know. little or nothing about.
This is the right spirit. and although
THE, PITT WEEKLY believes that
Johnson has made many mistakes, he
made a good move when he put the
‘ban on the player-writer. ‘ P

But at the University we have .an
example of the‘ other side of the
question. Chalmers Hall, the best
sporting edit-or thatever wrote ‘dope
,for a University publication, has an-
nounced hi intention of trying out
for. the ba ball team. In~_fact he
thinks that he.has« such a bright fu-
ture asa player that he has resigned
his position as sporting editor of THE
PITT VVEEKLY, to take eff ,the
first of the month. As far as’ we
know, this is the first case ofpa sport-
ing edit-or leaving his job to take up
the playing en-d of the game. We
hope that Chal will makegood in his

~ new venture, notwithstanding the fact

that he has, .left the paper in the
lurch, and we fervently hope that -he
will ‘be more of a success as an editor-
player ‘than the general run of player-
edritors. And having made the team
and having committed some “bone-
head” in a game, we won-der whether

editing copy when the ac-count of the
game is being preparedfor publica-
tion. '

Goon SPIRIT .

Little outbreaks like that which oc-
curred lbeltween the _members of the
freshman and sophomore classes last
Monday morning are good‘ for the
University,-notwithstanding the fact
that some ofpthe more conservative
members of -the faculty will not agree‘
with this statement. Such affairs are
the real essenceof University spirit.
The -man that goes through the Uni-
versity with his hands folded and
nevergets into a ﬁght or two fails
to get all that he ought to get out of
his college career. It makes every
person feel alittle more interested. in
the Urriversity after one of these af-
fairs; it_‘puts snap into the every day
routine work of the classroom. And,
strange as it may seem, a fellow feels
more like studying after a good frolic
of the nature of theione that took
place the other morning. We ought
to have more friendly outbreaks be-
tween. the classes.‘ Any damage to
the grounds or buildingsthatis done
in these ﬁghts (and there is seldom
any real "damage done) is more than
offset by the increased University
spirit that is forthcoming from these
struggles-of the classes.

MISS BAKEWELL’S SPEECH

In commenting on the speech de-
livered. last’ Friday morning by
Miss .Mary E. Bakewell, one of
the prominent wo1nan’s rights pro-
moters of this city, we wish to say,
in the first plalce, that her speech, as
a speech, was good and was delivered
in a pleas'ingV'manner. Mis Bakewell
spoke fluently for -thirty—& minutes
and neither read her speech, nor used
a single note. This is an accomplish-
ment which many men pave not at-
tained.

But as to the persuasiveness of the
speaker’s appeal, we have sonie——-in
fact, very» great-—doubt. VVe are not
sure that any of us, save a few prej-
any ‘ more in-
clined to extend the suffrage to
women than we did before. Miss

Bakewell gave a complete resume of . A

the subservient position of woman
from the time of the Greek suprem-
acy until the present; s-‘he spoke
of the ‘development of women’s clubs.
in the face of early criticism: and tl_1e
subsequent, pron_ounccd and lasting
beneﬁts that humanity has "derived
from these same clubs: she spoke of
the selﬁshness of man and the po-
litical mire into which he has plunged

our country, but Miss Bakewell failerl 
to show that the granting of the suf— e
frage to women would make the gov— A
A ernment of the United States so much

more efficient. - »

Needless to say, Miss Bakewell did
not point out very vividly the conduct
of the suffragettes in England, nor
‘did she recognize the fact that if
women conducted themselves in such
a reckless manner when making demg
onst-rations. for the right to vote, that
after they once got the coveted privi-
lege they might do more violent
things, if perchan-ce they failed to gain
a point they desired.

-However, one cannot expect a per-
son to dwell on facts tha1:.,would‘make
null and void their strongest ‘appeals,
and all in all, Miss Bakewell’s‘address
was good. We are anxious to hear
the other side of the question ex-
plained this morning. ~

However, the ﬂour went wide of the

were in front of them, "while the

of men at‘ his ,conini‘and,

army of 19145 “beat it” for the interior
of Thaw hall, while the fresh with
ﬁxed bayonets charged gallantly up
the steps. ,- ,

Gaining the ir}side. of the building
many of the ‘sophs” made their
escape by way of the basement, or by
hiking to the upper ﬂoors and hiding
in the rooms. But several of the real
‘heros of .the class-——about l0‘in num-

Great interest was-shown over the

many from attending the events. The

T _HE tobacco youenow smoke you consider
“better tobacco than you ever smoked before.”
Naturally, you kept trying until you found a

“better” one. i '
But it stands to reason that since there is a
difference in tobaccos you fmay "be missing still

Wgreater pleasure in a still better smoke——-in the

BEST smoke, in fact. , r

We know that Tuxedo is the best smoke because
we know that no better tobacco leaf grows, and
that no process of treating tobacco leaf equals the
Tuxedo process. ‘ 

  

The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette

0

.We know that Tuxedo is made’ of the BEST
tobacco—rich, mellow, perfectly aged «Kentucky
Burley. None better can be bought, because none
better is grown. ; " i ‘ L 

Tuxedo is pure tobacco, through and through
——handled under the cleanliest conditions.

_. It is treated by the famous on'gz'nal_“,Tuxedo .
process” forfremoving the sting and bite of the
natural vegetable oils. ' i ‘

I Tuxedo was,’ born in‘,1904‘. ‘ Its ﬁrstr imitator
appeared two years later. Since then a host of
imitations have sprung u-p. " -

No other tobacco can give -the unique pleasure

of Tuxedo because no other maker has yet been"

able to equal the Tuxedo quality!
Only by smoking the original can you get
complete satisfactionwrin pipe or cigarette.
