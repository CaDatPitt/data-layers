Chancellor Makes Seasonal Trip To Harrisburg For Funds

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

HARRISBURG—It was that time
of the year again.

It was the time of the year for
Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar to
present his school was a “sound
public investment” to state legis-
lators.

And it was the time of the year
for these same legislators to
respond with facts about a “tight”
ﬁscal budget and suggestions for
state-related schools to initiate
more internal cutbacks.

Posvar, surrounded by vice
chancellors and aides, yesterday
appeared before the state House
Appropriations Committee in
Harrisburg. ‘

“Our financial problem is simple
and obvious,” Posvar said. “We
are overwhelmed by inﬂation.”

Although committee members
appeared supportive of Posvar’s
plea for increased appropriations,
they made it apparent it would be
acceptance of Gov. Richard Thorn-
burgli’s proposed budget (and a tax
increase) that, would decide how
much money Pitt eventually re-
ceives.

“It’s like a bunch of people
coming into a room ﬁghting for
their piece of the pie,” Rep. Ivan
Itkin, D-Allegheny County, said.
“You are ultimately going to put
the decision to us.” v

“We are doing everything
internally that we can,” Posvar
said. I -

Thornburgh’s budget includes a
2.1 percent personal tax and a 10.5
percent corporate tax in addition to
a six percent sales" tax on gasoline.
This gas tax has met with
disapproval from both houses,
particularly new legislators who
were elected on a “no-tax”
platform.

The budget also includes a 4.7
percent increase in appropriations

‘for state-related universities and a

seven percent increase for state-
owned schools. Posvar said he
expected university revenues to
increase by seven percent, “which
is obviously less than the inﬂation
rate” of 11 percent.

'1 he university has requested $75
million in. state appropriations,
amounting to an 18.9 percent
increase over last year, This would
call for almost $12 million more
from the state than Pitt received for

1978-79. The state last year
granted Pitt $63 million), a 4.5
percent increaseover the gmevious.
year. \

Posvar also argued the “plight”
of Pitt’s Medical Schootll, where

tuiiiion has risen to $5,000 a ‘year,
compared to the Association ‘ of
Anlerican Universities average of
$22100. . '
' Ikep. Michael Schweder, D-Beth-
lehmm, questioned cutbacks initiat-

ed at Pitt, including a current
proposal to shut down the Titusville
branch campus. , ’

How Much Will Tuition Cost? 7

By T0/M KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staffwriter
HARRISBURG—Pitt ssttiudents
who accompanied Chancellor
Wesley Posvar to the state House
Appropriations Committesalhearing
yesterday left the capital] with an
unanswered question——ituition——
and how much it will costttillis fall.
-—“That’s the crux of the iissue,”
said Martin Bertocchii, lobby
coordinator for Student Govern-
ment’s Public and Govaimmental
Relations Committee. “'lIlnt’s our
main concern as students. They
(Pitt officials) didn’ttouch1Ilne issue
enough.”

, Posvar did not state approximate a.
‘ figures asto how. much tuiiﬁon may

increase if Pitt does not receive the
increase it seeks from the state. He

didlsay, however, that an increase
woliild be “very substantial.” "‘
_ “‘II think the representatives
wanted to know (exact figures),’’
saiikil Kim Watterson, Student
Gexvternment Board member.
“'IlIi;ey are committed and concern-
edl aahout higher education.”

~ Iliertocchi and Watterson were
jointed by student lobby committee
chriirman Jeff Miller and commit-‘
tee: imember Melissa Saul.

‘“‘ll think Dr. Posvar responded
well to the questions (from house
rmmnbers) but I think a lot of the
immnbers have already made up
thxciiir minds,” Bertocchi said. “‘I
d”t know if he changed‘ their
views at’"all.” ‘ ‘ "

‘‘‘‘Some of the» members were

. laughing and talking to each other

9

during the hearing,’
said. “They already know what
they are going to give us.”

The question of appropriations
for non-preferred status institu-
tions, such as Pitt, will partially be
decided by appropriations commit-

itees in both the House and Senate ~

before it reaches full debate by the
General‘ Assembly. Democrats,
who generally favor a tax increase
(which indirectly aids state-related
institutions) control the Senate
while Republicans, who oppose
raising taxes, hold a slim majority

. in the House.

_“They (the General Assembly)
will have a problem getting the

revenue,” Bertocchi said. “Before , ‘

they give the appropriation they
have to get the revenue.”

Protestors Heckle Activist Kate Millet At NOW Forum

By MARGI S'l‘UMPF

_ Pitt News Staff Writer

It wasn’t what Kate Millett had
to say, but just that she was there.

The middle-aged lesbian femin-
ist was at Pitt Wednesday night to
speak at a forum held in Benedum
Hall, sponsored by the Pitt Campus
National Organization for Women
and Pitt Union Program Council.

But during her speech, Millett
was verbally attacked several times
by persons dissatisfied with her
approach to the feminist movement
in Iran.

Millett is the author of “Sexual
Politics," a book that drew national
attention when it was published
several years ago and that stirred
controversy because of its feminist
stance.

Millett also stirred controversy
last month after she was extradited
from Iran during her trip there to
meet with Iranian feminists.

She contends that those women
need support from feminists across

Shadyside residents angry over Pitt frater-
nities on Bayard Street have asked the state
House Appropriations Committee to force the
university to deal with neighbor's complaints.
The-residents asked the committee not to give
Pitt funds unless officials sigh a letter of com-
mitment, report quaterly to a neighborhood
group and participate in a meeting with Mayor

the world to defend themselves
against the regime of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, which she
termed ultra-right and conserva-
tive.

"‘I have a great fear for my
sisters there (in Iran). I have great
fear for that the movement there
will be crushed.

“I appeal to you not only as
feminists but as humanists...
to insure that the. revolution is
saved...that Iranian women will not
be squashed,” Millett said during
her address. .

But political groups, as well as
some Iranians, hold that Millett is a
puppet of the U.S. government who
wishes to continue a policy of
American imperialism in Iran.

Representatives of several poli-
tical groups were outside Benedum
last night distributing both anti-
and pro-Millett literature.

Millett was verbaly attacked
several times by persons in the
audienceas she spoke.

Soon after Millett took ﬂu‘ place
at the podium,’ one woiiuan rose
from the seat in the back of the
auditorium to call Mlillllett a
“bourgeoise capitalist.

“You try to put womein against
men,” she said.

When the woman contiimied her
outburst, the audience began
clapping their hands and silamping
their feet while chanting ““let her
speak, let her speak.”

After the heckler was silenced,
Millett began describiimg her
experiences in Iran.

“Iran was to see the smuggle of
women in danger. I have never‘
known this before. I have never
seen such hostility, anger, crazi-
ness before,” Millett said. _

Political forces in Iran are not
receptive to the feminist move-
ment, she said.

A rally in Tehran on March 8 to
protest conservative dress codes-
the wearing by musleum women of
a long, traditional dress that covers

neaurly all of their bodies--was
mairked by physical attacks made
by opponents of the march, Millett
said. _

But the marchers were protected
by men who linked their arms
together toishield the women as
they marched, she continued.

“There were some very beautiful
men. . .‘warm, vibrant. . .who guard-
edl us from...the knives and fists of
the attackers and they (the men)

did it at the risk of their lives,” I

Millett said.

“We wereattacked daily, daily,
daily,” she stated, with nc
protection from government mil-
itia.

A group of Iranians in th
audience several times spoke or
against Millett, calling her “crazy
at Central Intelligence agent.”

One women rose during
question and answer period afti
Millet1’s speech to say:

“I am an Iranian woman.
don't need you help.”

  Mandatory

’ By THOMAS McALOON
, Pitt News Staff Writer

The installation of a mandatory
English examination for all incom-
ing freshman will be subject of a
special Faculty of Arts and

Sciences meeting April 10.
“In the last several years we
have found that quite a few
-students really aren’t ready for the
‘writing demands made by the

0 university,” said David Brumble,

Professor of English, and supporter
of the plan.
— A similar resolution has already
been aproved by the CAS Council.
d If passed by the FAS, the measure
would take effect beginning with
the fall term of 1979. Following the
\proposal’s guidelines, all incoming
freshmen and transfer students
would fake a diagnostic writing
examination.

' Over the — past few years
freshmen have been given reading
and writing tests during summer
orientation. Students found to be
deficient were advised to register
Basic Reading and Writing, on
a voluntary basis.

“In fall, 1978, 50% of the
students advised into Basic Read-

ing and Writing actually enrolled‘

into the course,” reads the English
Department proposal drafted by
David Bartholomae, professor of
English.

The proposal would require
students found to be deficient in
writing skills to enroll in Basic
Reading and a Writing, or Basic
Writing. Under this plan, students
would. be required to complete the

credits. Students failing to com-
plete would be suspended from the
College of Arts and Sciences.
“This test will not affect the
majority of students who take it,”
Brumble said. “It is designed to

pick up that 20% that really needs O

the help.”
“I’m worried about the motiva-
tion behind those students forced

into taking basic writing courses,” ~

Robert Marshall former dean of
CAS said.

By making participation in this
program mandatory, the English
Department believes students who
try to avoid writing courses here at
the university, would be forced to
have their problem corrected.-

“With the proper atmosphere
and proper advising, you can get
the same results as the mandatory
program without setting up a new
bureaucracy,” said Marshall.

“The program is absolutely
worthless if the student doesn’t
write afterward. Once a person has
taken the basic writing courses,
everyone will relax and the
problem would be swept under the
rug,” Marshall said.

“The educationally more. chal-
lenging situation that involves the
total commitment to better writing

by the entire CAS teaching staff,

would be dropped for the easy way
out. Once the English Department
rubber stamps someone able to
write, the other professors will stop
worrying about their students
writing, because the English
Department would have removed
the burden from them.”

“I don’t think that will happen. I

Commuter

By PETER KARLOVICH
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Student Government

Board's Commuter Affairs Com-
mittee met yesterday to discuss
plans to move its office to the
location of the«Off-Campus Hous-
ing Office. ‘ \

Mary Lou Sosso, director of the
Off-Campus Housing Office,
addressed the committee.

“This committee is really my
responsibility,” Sosso said. -“It
was organized by (former SGB
member) Dave Hesidence and

‘myself several years ago, but

didn’t really get off the ground.
My main function is to cut red tape

so the committee is free to
function.”
Sosso also said that the

committee needs to do something
to get the attention of the student
body.

“I have money allocated to me

an effort to reverse the downward
trend in writing ability.”

Dean Schulman recognizes the
fact that instructors are hesitant to
make the test a fixed requirement.

‘ ‘It’s a two way problem. One the
one hand we want to treat students
as adults. But, we do have the
responsibility to graduate college
students who have the ability to
write and write well,” said
Schulman.

According to Schulman, a case in a

committee,” Sosso said. “Some
schools get 80 percent of the
student government funds. I think
the commuter committee should be
the largest student organization on
campus. ~

“The committee, which repre-
sents 60 percent of the student
body, currently receives $250. The
issue of the office space was also
raised.

“I have a room in the
Off-Campus Housing Office that
can be used for the committee,”
Sosso said. “This would make
access for the average commuter
easier.”

Sosso also said her office has
$950 available especially for
commuters. These funds may not
be used after June 30.

The possibility of using some of
the money for the publication of a
commuter newsletter was also
raised.

point would be the football team.

“We have a scandalously low
graduation rate for football players.
This new measure ‘would force
them to get this writing require-
ment in, and it would also help
them in the long run. They would
be able to communicate better in
other courses, helping more
players to graduate possibly.”

On the chances of the mandatory
writing diagnostic examination
passing the FAS council, Schulman
said it would “breeze through.”

“We plan to get out an issue of
the newsletter before the end of the
term and also publish one for
freshman orientation,” said
Forrest Buffenmyer, assistant
editor. “The money from
off-campus housing will pay. for
these two issues, but we’re not
sure where the money will come
from next year.”

Committee members are being
asked to write stories for the
newsletter. ‘

“I will probably be able to get
money allocated for the newsletter
next year,” Sosso said. “But you
will have to try to get more money
allocated from the Student Govern-
ment Board. There are really no
restrictions on what I can budget
for. The vice chancellor wants to
see a large commuter committee

you all the help you need.”

said. “(Titusvi1le) could become a

ﬁnancial liability in the near
future.’ ’
Posvar added that ﬁnancial

problems similar to the Titusville
situation did not exist at the other
branch campuses.

Schweder also argued against
allocating a “lump sum” to Pitt,
stating that Pitt should receive
money only for programs offered
that are not available at other
private universities and colleges in
Pennsylvania.

“We are funding programs (at
Pitt) that are available at other
institutions across the state,”
Schweder said. “I don’t know if we
are going to be able to earmark a
lump sum of money (to Pitt) in the
future.”

Schweder then asked if the
university could submit an itemized
breakdown of schools and depart-
ments, indicating amounts of
money each actually receives from
state appropriations.

“It could be justiﬁable,” said
Posvar, “but it would make our
budgetary process very, very

» difficult. ’ ’

Rep. Itkin questioned the exist-
ence of Pitt’s school of education,
stating that he believed the school

was not practical given the fact that
“only half” of the students with
degrees in education eventually
find jobs in that field.

“The university should continue
a school of education," Posvar
said. “Ninety-ﬁve percent of
those students who applied at our
placement office last year were
placed in jobs.

“A great many of these people
enter the sales or marketing ﬁeld
for which their training (in
education) has adequately prepar-
ed them.” '

Committee chairman Richard
McClatchy, R-Rosemont, said at
the close of the hearing that
Thornburgh’s proposed budget
was the issue at hand and that a
“non-continuation” of taxes could

in fact take place. He then asked
the chancellor the size of the tuition
increase Pitt would have to pass if
taxes were cut.

“We worry about it,” Posvar
said. “I can’t give a speciﬁc

ﬁgure. It would have to be very
substantial for we would face a very
serious funding crisis.”

Posvar is due to appear before
the Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee Monday.

Shadyside Residents
Protest Frats To State

By The Associated Press

- HARRISBURG—A group of
Pittsburgh residents, fed up with
what they call bordello conditions
created by raucous fraternities on
their block, asked a House
committee yesterday to force the
University of Pittsburgh to deal
with the problem.

Rep. Frank Pistella read a
statement from the Shadyside
Neighbors for Progress to uni-
versity officials and House mem-
bers attending a budget hearing.

“The behavior of the University
of Pittsburgh fraternity men and
their guests run the gamut from
loud noises and public drunkeness
to public urination and public
fornication...and incidences of
vandalism,” the statement said.

Residents have complained that

university officials have ignored
the incidents,
have occurred repeatedly over an
eight year period on Bayard Street.

The statement asked that the
school be given funding this year‘
only if it signs a letter of
commitment to solve the problem,
report back quarterly to the
neighborhood group and partici-
pate in a meeting with the
Pittsburgh mayor.

University officials had no
comment when the statement was
read.

Later, university Chancellor
Wesley Posvarsaid the school has
been investigating the problem.

“The tone of the document
should be taken at face value,” he
said.

attorney representing Metropolitan Edison and
Duquesne Light, said the additional costs must be
“flowed through to customers.” I I

The additional costs that will occur because
Metropolitan Edison must now use coal and gas
fueled plants to supply its customers with electricity
are not small. According to Hazel Rollins, deputy
administrator of the Economic Regulatory Ad-
ministration, the average central Pennsylvania family
can expect an immediate $7.50 a month increase to its
usual bill of $35 to $40 per month.

increasing their rates to pay for the closings, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the energy
subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee was
not enthused about their plans.

“This is not an academic issue. Throughout the
country, poor and moderate income consumers are
barely able to pay their bills. Their bills could
skyrocket if a $500 million to $1 billion in additional
costs are added to a local utility’s costs,” Kennedy
said.

Rep. Eugene Atkinson, D-Beaver County, has
proposed a bill that could prevent the electric com-
panies from forcing consumers from bearing the
burden of the utilities’ mistakes. If the bill is passed,
the federal government would set up a fund to pay
for shutdown and repairs required by the govern-
ment, rather than allowing Duquesne Light and
others to increase their rates.

Atkinson’s proposal seems to be on the right track.
If we are to operate under acapitalistic economy,
however modified, it seems unfair to allow utilities to
force customers to pay for a company’s mistake.
Under a classic capitalist theory, the power com-

, panies should have to pay for the accident at Three

Mile Island and the repairs at Beaver Valley by cut-
ting into their profits.

son proposes, there could be other actions taken
along a similiar vein to chain the hungers of the
power companies. Pennsylvania already has the
Public Utilities Commission, the government agency
whose supposed job is to control the utility com-
panies of our state.

The -PUC has proved to be too friendly to the in-
terests of power companies, but it still could be the
best vehicle to keep utilities from foisting extra costs
from plant closings to utility customers. If the state
legislature would take the initiative, it could make it
illegal for Duquesne Light, Metropolitan Edison, and
other power companies pay for the costs that result
from the accident at Three Mile -Island and the faulty
construction at Beaver Valley. In an economic
system where companies are supposed to profit by
acting intelligently and effectively and lose by acting
ineptly, this is the only adequate answer to the

BAS Budget Cuts A ‘Divide, C0nquer’Strategy

As white students who have been
involved with the Black Studies
Department, and have attended

events sponsored by Black Actioni

Society, we want to respond to
several points made by Joseph

’ Tierney in his March 30 letter_ to

The Pitt ‘News.

The only charge that Tierney
makes inan up-front manner is that
no one"except black students have
the “slightest” interest in
BAS Programs. For one, BAS
events hold considerable interest

for the -black community that

surrounds Pitt campus on’ every
side except Shadyside. Secondly, a
considerable number of white
students and members of the
university community do attend
society events like Gil Scot-Heron,
Haki Madhubuti (Don L. Lee) and
others. This in itself is not
important.

B The thinly veiled charge that
Tierney makes is of much more
importance than the numbers of
whites who "attend BAS events.
Tierney states that he, (along with
all whites supposedly) “will never

beneﬁt” from programming dir-
ected at black students. The
implication here is that black
programming hurts (takes away)
opportunities (money) from whites.
This notion, that programs de-
signed to beneﬁt blacks hurt the
interests of whites, is very
widespread and dangero_us_today.

With the U.S. economy in crisis,
the capitalists must move to
strengthen a base of support for
themselves and at the same time
cut spending. The usual method is
to rob Peter to pacify Paul and pay

themselves. For example, Cali-
'fornia’s proposition 13 wreaks
ﬁscal havoc on social service
programs, which are important to
oppressed minorities, tosses a few
crumbs to white homeowners, and
a cake to landlords. .

The U.S. Supreme court, UCLA
Board of Regents, and Allan Bakke
lead an attack on afﬁrmative action
quotas in education by claiming
that special admission programs
for blacks and other oppressed
nationalities, “discriminate
against” (hurt) whites. The Bakke
Decision is hailed as a “Victory for
Whites,” and blacks and others are

denied access to the university,

while tuition hikes continue.

So, it is no surprise that the
administration and its hacks are
trying to steal from BAS in the
name of “equality.” What is
surprising and distressing is that
these other students are so eager to
be accomplices, and will sit down
and write letters to The Pitt News
telling BAS to “sit down and shut
up” in the name of “cooperation.”

Students must keep in mind that,
alone, we are all “minorities.”
The key question is whether or not
one is an oppressed minority.
Blacks are, have been, and will
continue to be oppressed, as long
as it remains possible for the
capitalists to do so. Greeks are a
self-selected group, very close to
the administration, with a lot of
power. Greek programs help a
“minority” to escape from the

“trials and tribulations" of being a

‘ Pitt student.

Black students have nowhere to
run. In the late 605, black students
demanded that Pitt fund special
programs so that they as students,
could further the struggle of the
black community. This is why

Black Studies and BAS are here,
and this is why they are being cut.

Relevant black programs beneﬁt
all students because they are
directed at black students, not in
spite of that direction. The same
system that oppresses black

people, oppresses all workers and
students. This is why many whites
do attend the programs put on by
BAS. -

The administration and its party
hacks on the allocations committee
are playing the racist game of
“divide and conquer” with the
governance groups. Instead of
trying to excape ‘ or to better
themselves at the expense of BAS,
these groups should be making
attacks on BAS and Black Studies a
focal point in the struggle to defend
all educational programs against
cut backs and tuition hikes. The
unity that has developed between
black and white students as a result
of relevant black programs will
make this task easier.

Dressingfor Success Means a Conservative Look

“Dress for Success” was the appropriate title for a fashion show sponsored
by Pitt’s business fraternity Wednesday night in the Student Union. The show
was geared for those venturing out into the business world.

The show was presented‘ by Saks Fifth Avenue and was directed by Judy
Wolk, fashion coordinator of Saks.

The look this year is conservative; neutral color (especially beige) with narrow
lapels. V ’ \.

Most of the clothes at the show were by big name designers—Evan-Picone for
women and Christian Dior for men.

Although the latest trend for women is subdued-no disco clothes at the office,
please— Walk suggested that the neutral suits be brightened with colorful shirts ‘%
or scarves. Shoes were very feminine, mostly pumps or sandals (open and
closed toes). Suit jackets are shorter this season, softly tailored and belted at
the waist with either natural fabric or patent leather belts.

Pants for both sexes are neither super straight nor wide-bottom. They are a
bit looser than the cigarette style width currently popular in designer jeans.

East Team Defeats Midwest in Dapper Dan Roundball Action

Bv The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—- Baltimore's
smooth Quintin Dailey and Brook-
lyn’s slamming Sidney Green led a
second-half rally that gave the East
a 111-105 victory over the Midwest
Thursday night in the opening
game of the Roundball Classic high
school all-star basketball tourna-
ment.

The Pennsylvania squad, featur-
ingn 7-foot-1 Sam Bowie, met the
South all-stars in the second game
at the Civic Arena. The winners
meet Friday night following a
consolation matchup of the losers.

Dailey, a 6-foot-4 product of
Cardinal Gibbons High School in
Baltimore, led all scorers with 22
points in the opening game.

The East, which trailed 60-49 at
halftime, outscored the Midwest
20-8 in the opening ﬁve minutes of
the third quarter. Dailey had 10 of
those points to help put his team on
top 69-68.

The Midwest, topped by the
19-point scoring of 6-foot-7 Darren
Daye of Granada Hills, Calif., then
ran off a dozen points in succession
to take an 80-69 advantage.

However, the East took com-

Pantnerette MVP

By KAREN KADILAK
"Pitt News Staff Writer

Pantherette sprinter Gwen
Murray admits that as a student
during ﬁnalsvweek, she has some
unusual plans.

"‘,Most people are ready to go
home,” the sophomore said. “I’m
ready to go to the Penn Relays.”

April marks the end of the school
year for most Pitt students, but not
for members of the women's track
team. The Pantherettes’ current
season ends in May.

“It doesn’t make much differ-
ence to me when I go home,” said
Murray who was named her team’s
most valuable performer at Tues-
day’s all-sports banquet. “I can go
home anytime. Butler, my

hometown, isn’t too far from

here.”

Murray, despite a recurring leg
injury, has been one of Pitt’s top
sprinters. She qualiﬁed for the
Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women national
championships in three events last
spring.

‘‘I want to do better this
season,” said Murray. “Person-
ally, I was disappointed that I
didn’t do better indoors, but the leg
bothered me at times. My leg
would be good, than I would
reinjure it. The season was totally
disappointing.’ ’

Murray initially injured her
hamstring last May in the AIAW
championships at the University of
Tennessee.

mand in the ﬁnal quarter behind
Dailey and Green, a 6-foot-9 center
from Thomas Jefferson High
School in Brooklyn. Green, who
totaled 16 points, had 10 of them in
the ﬁnal three minutes.

Green’s three-point play with
2:40 left put the East in the lead to
stay at 101-98. With about 30
seconds left, Dailey missed ' a
twisting layup, but Green skim-
med the ball on the backboard and
rammed home a two-handed dunk.

Tim Andree, a 6-foot-11 center

A from Birmingham, Mich., had 14

points for the Midwest and_

6-foot-11 Stever Stipanovich of St.
Louis had 11.

Antoine Carr, a wicked dunker
from Wichita, Kan., scored 21
points to lead the Southwest 10 a
97-92 victory over Pennsylvania
last night in the Roundball Classic
high school all-star basketball
tournament.

The Southwest plays for the
championship tonight against the
East.

The Midwest plays in Friday
night’s consolation game against
Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania's 7-foot-1 Sam

Bowie fouled out with five minutes
left after scoring 11 points.

It was the powerfully-built Carr
who drew the sixth and ﬁnal
personal foul off Bowie.

The Southwest, which led 48-46
at halftime, outscored Pennsyl-
vania 18-6 to take a 90-71 lead with
about four minutes left.

Pennsylvania was led by 6-foot-6
Larry Anderson of Pittsburgh with
17 points, followed by 6-foot-6 Bill
Varner of New Kensington and
6-foot-8 Walter Stone of Erie with
12 each. Six-foot-4 Horace Owens
of Philadelphia‘ added 10.

Volleyball Team in Virginia  
For Conference Toumament

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt will travel to Virginia this
weekend to compete in the ﬁfth
annual George .Mason Patriot
Invitational Volleyball Tourna-
ment. The invitational will include
10 teams from the Eastern College
Volleyball Organization.

The Panthers have already
competed against two of the ﬁve
tea-ms they will face in their
bracket. Pitt’s bracket will include
Penn State, (the number two team
in the East behind Rutgers),
Madison College, North Carolina
and the University of Pennsylvania.
In their contests with Penn State
earlier this season, the Panthers
were outmanned by the strong,
experienced Nittany Lions. Pitt
defeated Penn this year, 3-2.

Competition in this tournament
will consist of established teams.
According to Mike Hebert, it is this
type of competition that the
Panthers have been using to gain
the much-needed experience their
ﬁrst year.

“This tournament is ﬁlled with
some very strong, established
teams like we have been competing
against all season,” said Hebert.
“We’ve scheduled this type of
lineup throughout the year,

“It’s the ﬁrst serious track injury
I’ve had,” she said. “It will feel
good, then it will feel bad. Right
now, it feels good. I’m hoping that
it stays that way and the warm
weather will make it feel. better.”

Murray competed in only one
event in last weekend’s Virginia
Invitational, leading the mile relay
team to a third place ﬁnish.

“Alfreeda (Coach Goff) wanted
to see if my leg was strong enough
before she uses me in the multiple
events,” said Murray,’ who
ordinarily competes in at least four
events.

Murray, a former high school
state champion in the 200-meter
dash, will compete in tomorrow's
triangular meet against Ohio and
Indiana (Pa.) at Pitt Stadium.

One of her best meets was

including the tournament because

this season will lay a groundwork ‘

for our upcoming years.”

The ‘Panthers will begin play
against Penn State. The all-day
tournament will then have Pitt
facing Madison, North Carolina,
and Penn. All preliminary matches
will be best two out of three,
11-point games.

Champions will be decided by a

playoff of the top two teams from.

each division. The other bracket
constists of Duke, George Mason,
East Stroudsburg State, PSU at
Hazelton and Navy. Playoff games
will be the best two out of three,
15-point games.

Two teams within each group
will play each other in a semiﬁnal
contest and the winner of each
game will meet in a ﬁnal match at
the end of the day.

Since there are many teams Pitt
has not competed against ‘this
season, it is hard for the Panthers
to guess the outcome of the
tournament. Pitt will be one of the
weaker teams due to their ﬁrst year

status in the league.

“If we were a part of the
Western Pennsylvania league
which we could have joined, we
may be considered to be one of the
stronger teams involved,” said

against the Ohio Wildcats last
January. She took ﬁrst place in the
200 and was part of both Pitt’s
victorious 880- and mile relay.

_ ten at

Hebert. “For instance, Allegheny,
the team we beat in a match 3-0 last
weekend is one of the stronger
teams. We decided to enter this
league for the type of competition
that is found there. This will add to
the experience the team will have
gained this season.”

Pitt will be looking forward to
being successful in this tournament
this weekend. A victory would
alleviate some of the skepticism
concerning the ﬁrst-year Panther
program.

“The team will be putting in a
strong effort to win this tourna-
ment,” said Hebert. “A good
performance will do a lot to prove
to our competitors and those people
at Pitt who have been skeptical of
our program.” .

Junior Mark Ochs. who has come
on strong at the end of this season
agrees. '

“We’re hoping that facing Penn
State in our ﬁrst match will work to
our advantage. We hope to catch
them off guard early and surprise
them. Our goal is to ﬁnish second
in our bracket, which is a very
tough one. If we are able to receive
a strong game from Arnie
(Matthews), and our defense looks
like it did last week, we should be
able to achieve this goal.”

  Clancy  

  Tries For

USA Team

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—The big man on
the Pitt basketball team, Sam
Clancy, will compete in the Pan
American trials for a spot on the
United States basketball team, the
school said last night.

“His selection shows the respect
he carries across the country,” said
Pitt Coach Tim Grgurich. “Sam is
a complete player. His selection

' will give him an opportunity to

compete against the best amateur
players in America.”

The Pan American games will be
held in Puerto Rico during the first
two weeks of July. The U.S. team
will begin practice on June 3.

Clancy averaged 15.4 points and
12.5 rebounds last season as Pitt
finished with an 18-11 record and
made the ﬁnals of the Eastern
Eight tournament. -

A 6-foot-6 forward, Clancy was
named honorable mention All-
America and to several All-East
ﬁrst teams. He was also selected to
the Eastern Eight’s first team and‘
was named District Player-of-the-
Year.

The top 64 amateur basketball
players in the U.S. were chosen for

the trials scheduled to begin April -

18 in Bloomington, Ind., according
to North Carolina Coach Dean
Smith, chairman of the player
selection committee.

Key to early diagnosis of
cancer of the colon and rec-
tum is the proctosigmoidos-
copy as part of the regular
health checkup. The Ameri-
can Cancer Society urges
everyone over 40 to have it.

   

Sam Clancy has been chosen to try out for the USA team, which will play in the

Pan Am games.

Lady Tracksters Home;

For the first time in two years,
the Pitt women’s track team will
compete in Pitt Stadium when the
Pantherettes take on Ohio Univer-

sity and Indiana (Pa.) tomorrow
I morning. ‘

The Pantherettes are coming off
a ﬁfth-place finish at the University
of Virginia Invitational, run last
weekend. Pitt faced Ohio in an
indoor dual meet last February,
when the Pantherettes won nearly
every event. Although Indiana has
not directly competed against Pitt
in track this year, the Pantherettes
defeated tomorrow’s visitors in
cross-country last October and won
a dual meet against them outdoors
in 1978.

Sprinter Gwen Murray will test a
recently reinjured leg by competing
in the ‘880-yard medley relay, mile
relay and open 440 event. Others
favored in their events will be Peri
Jude Radecic, shot put and discus,

Pitt News 5!?

By The Associated Press

TUPPER LAKE, N.Y. - Officials
in this tiny Adirondack village say
they are “angry, outraged and
disappointed” because they have
been left off the preferred ticket list
for the 1980 Winter Olympics.

They began complaining to
Olympic officials Tuesday because
they say that while they won’t get
special tickets, they are having
their motel and hotel rates
controlled by the state during the
Games.

IT upper Lake, population about
5,000, is less than 40 miles from
Lake Placid, the site of the Winter
Games. Olympic officials have said
they will allocate 50,000 tickets to a
preferred area surrounding Lake
Placid, but that area does not
include Tupper Lake.

 

BEAU .’*«lOl‘*l"I‘, Texas - When new
Lamar iUnive1'sity Coach Larry
Keene. issued an open invitation
for an»;-.ne to give spring football
trainirg a try, he didn’t envision
two coeds showing up the first day.

Cindy Dewies and Kay Dow ran
through pass routes in the rain with
the Cardinal team Tuesday.

“We’re not trying to make the
team, we just wanted to see what it
was like,” said Dow.

Keenan issued orders there
would be no tackling of the coeds.

“If they makethe team, there I

won't be any male reporters in our
locker room, either,” Keenan

quipped.

LOS ANGELES - Larry Bird of
Indiana State has been voted the

recipient of the third annual John
Wooden Award by the Los Angeles
Athletic Club as college basket-
ball’s player of the year.

Second place went to Earvin
“Magic” Johnson of Michigan
State, the club announced.

Bird received more than twice
the votes of his nearest rival.

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. - Some
well-known football coaches are
planning to play in the first
National Football Foundation and
Hall of Fame Golf Classic here
April 22-25.

Anthony Capps, co-chairman of
the tournament, said early entries
include Paul Bryant, coach at the
University of Alabama, and John

 as From the World of Sports

McKay, coach of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.

Former President Gerald Ford,
honorary chairman of the tourna-
ment, also has entered.

The golfers will play for $30,000
in prizes. The National Football
Foundation’s Endowment Fund is
the beneﬁciary of the event.

BUFFALO, N.Y. - The Buffalo
Bills have put off a ticket price
increase for two weeks because of
what a spokesman for the Naitonal
Football League team called
“unprecedented interest in the
purchase of new season tickets.”

Stew Barber, vice president in
charge of administration, said 1978
prices would apply to tickets
purchased until April 18.
