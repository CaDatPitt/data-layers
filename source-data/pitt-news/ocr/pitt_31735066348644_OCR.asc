Announce Plans

To Hold Tuition

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Intensifying their efforts to stave A

off a tuition increase, Pitt’s three
Student Governments completed
strategies to mobilize campus sup-
port at an open meeting yesterday.

The undergraduate Student Gov-
Studies

-£..7"’ion_al Student Association (GPSA),

announced the major vehicle of the
efforts will be START UP day,
April 3 through April  _

An acronym for “Students
Against Rising Tuition at the
University of Pittsburgh,” START
UP day is an attempt to utilize the
combined voices of Pitt students,
University personnel, parents and
faculty in influencing Harrisburg
legislators. The move is a plan to
increase the University’s state

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The University started the wrap-
up of its case in the Pitt

‘faculty-union hearings yesterday

with the testimony of Provost
Rhoten A. Smith.

Smith testified that having more
than one union agent bargaining
for Pitt faculty would seriously
damage University progress in
developing cross-departmental
research and studies as a realiza-
tion‘ of the Litchfield “organic
university” concept.

Under direct examination by
University lawyer Ralph Zimmer-
man, the Provost said separate
bargaining units as opposed to the
“one university-one union” pro-
posal of Pitt administrators would
aggravate the problem of depart-
mental isolationism. '

Smith also ' discussed proposed
integration of Pitt’s newly-

expanded Law School with other e

academic programs as further
evidence of an on-going policy of
“organic” development in curric-
ulum.

The Provost described the nature

and function of his office in the’

total operation of University in
terms of" tenure or promotion
approvals and curriculum super-
vision.

Provost Smith’s testimony is .one
more_ link in the University
argument against establishment of
more than one bargaining agent for
Pitt faculty.

The “one university-one union”
plan hinges on a state labor law
that provides protection for institu-
tions like Pitt against over-
fragmentation. .

Testimony of University witnesses
is aimed at demonstrating the
interrelation and centralization of

.operations at Pitt and the deleter-

ious effects of fragmentation.

According to Hearing Examiner
Sidney Lawrence, Smith’s testi-
mony ends the academic and
administrative phase of the Uni-
versity case, leaving only sched-
uled testimony concerning the role
of library staff in any proposed
bargaining unit.

‘ Pitt Labor Hearings Resume

Cross-examination of Provost
Smith by attorneys representing
the six petitioning unions at the
faculty-union hearings is scheduled
for this morning.

The March session of the
faculty-union hearings opened
Monday with the testimony of

Edison Montgomery, associate‘
vice-chancellor of the Health

Professions.

City Council Approves

One-Way Forbes—Fifth   

BY ERIC _VAN CHANTPORT
The one-way pairing of Forbes
and Fifth'Avenues is no longer in

‘' jeopardy, as City Council voted

Monday to write the present street
pattern into law.

The 6-3 vote was a replay of last
Wednesday's committee session
vote at which council reversed its
long standing support of two-way
traffic on both avenues.

BY BRIAN DUNN
The one-way traffic pattern on
Forbes and Fifth Avenues should
be kept, according to an over-

. whelming majority of Pitt students

and a plurality of Oakland
merchants questioned in a Pitt
News poll last week.._

Eighty-four per cent of students
and 44% of businessmen said they
favored the current system; 9°76 of
students and 32% of businessmen
preferred ‘two-way traffic; and 7%
of students and 24% -of business-.
men expressed no opinion.

One hundred students, ques-
tioned individually at the Cathedral

‘of Learning, Hillman Library, the

Student Union, the Towers
Lobby and Benedum Hall, and 25
merchants, questioned at their

‘places of business along Forbes

and Fifth, responded to the survey.

When the one-way system was
installed in June, " 19.72, m_ost
merchants opposed it because they
feared a decline in business.
However, a plurality in the poll said
there has been no fall-off,. and
one-way is personally more con-
venient. '

“There hasn’t been a drop-off;
there’s been an increase,” said
Abe Marcovsky, manager of the
Oakland Hardware store. “This

inﬂuenced by its ‘anger at the
Mayor and argued, “A return to
the congestion and confusion of the
two-way system would make Pitt a

little more dangerous and a lot‘.

more unpleasant for all of us.”
Studies of traffic movement and
pedestrian safety favored one-way
traffic flow, which was endqrsed by
Port Authority Transit, the City

Planning Department and several ' . '

other groups. The major’ opposi-

tion came from the Oakland.  ..
ber of Commerce and an uptown _-

group.

The University administration had].

hoped Council would consider.the
one-way legislation as part _of a
wide-ranging transportation ._ pack-

Live wire: Ans wers on GRE Fee Waivers-

BY PETE BUTCH

This week's Livewire isiof special interest to the 400-500
seniors, as estimated through yearly trends by the Office of,
Measurement and Evaluation, who will be taking the
Graduate Record Examination (GRE) in April or June.

The GRE was the subject of last week's Livewire, which
pointed out that 108 of the 125 GRE free waivers allocated
to Pitt by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the test

administrators, went unused.

Student Government Board member Dan Stiffler and the -
Livewire reporter met with Associate Provost for Graduate

Studies and Research Dr. Joseph Shoben to try to alleviate

the problem,

Shoben asked that the Livewire publicize the possibility of
waivers for students taking the GRE this,April or.,June. He - . —

According to Shoben, Pitt is in no danger of getting its
allotment of 125 waivers reduced by ETS. He explained
the figure is a calculated percentage based on enrollment
and other factors, but not on the amount of previously\

 

     

expenses.

explained that students receiving financial aid from their
parents are not ineligible, provided none of that aid is for
academic expenses.

Shoben said the office of Student Aid gave him a list of
students receiving no parental contribution to academic
Any student wishing to have his GRE fee
waived must go to the Office of the Provost (801 CL) with a
letter of recommendation from a faculty advisor to show he
is serious about going to graduate school.

If he is a student in good academic standing at Pitt and is
on the list of students’ not receiving parental academic
contributions, he will have his GRE fee waived.

issued waivers.

He also defended the sending of memos publicizing the

. waivers to department heads and not to faculty advisors.

» Shoben said he felt it would be infeasible since nearly all
faculty members serve as advisors, and there are
approximately 2,000 faculty here at Pitt. The number of
memos would be enormous.

Shoben is confident, however, that memos to department

chairmen are sufficient, since he feels students come in
contact enough with their department chairmen to be
informed of the GRE fee waiver.

So, because of paperwork feasibility, the situation
remains unchanged, with a student relying on word from _ ,‘
his department or the Livewire for word on GRE fee‘ yd

“Students will be asked to tell

--a decline in the quality of educa-
tion for students here. There are
also persistent rumors of impend-
ing cuts'in programs, especially in
the‘ area of Black Studies and
Women’s Studies, but elsewhere
as well. i

In a sense, the cause of the
problem is the declining US econ-
omy-.-inﬂation, unemployment, re-
cession. Paradoxically, the corpor-
ations that control our economy
continue to make record proﬁts.

' Democratic and Republican politi-

cans--hoping to appeal to the
majority of voters (who are feeling
the pinch), but unwilling to anta-
gonize their big. ﬁnancial contribu-

_tors (who would resent substantial '
’ ‘ ‘taxes-on corporate -proﬁts)--tend to.

favor Governor Shapp’s formula: a
public budget that “holds the line
on spending and calls for no new
general fund taxes.” Holding the

_ line on spending usually’-means

cuts in money for health, welfare
and education (including state-re--

lated schools like Pitt). - .

Student Government Presiden
Larry Platt’s response has been
that we “have a good chance of
getting more out of the legislature,
but we will have to work for it.”
Speciﬁcally, he has initiated a
“blitz” of student letter-writing
and telephoning to legislators. At
the same time, however, he asserts
“students as a group don’t wield
enough bargaining power to do this
alone.”

terms. It will undoubtedly go a

long way to render student.

activities_at Pitt more meaningful
and politically, educationally, and
socially more enhancing than eve_r

"ef°’e_- THIRD WORLD PEOPLES;

_ and

To give more‘ weight to the
student effort, he says, “the thrust
of our "attack will be coordinated
with the (University) administra-
tion...We’ve got to go through
proper channels.” Among other
things, this student-administration
alliance also was to be directed
against “raising faculty salaries,”
according to an early statement by
Platt. (Fortunately, he has drawn
back from this proposal, realizing
that “inadequate salaries for fac-
ulty...directly’affect the quality of
education” for Pitt students). The
Pitt News editors go further,
asserting this student-administra-
tion alliance must, “be-prepared to
offer hard facts” on “reasons for

spending education funds here at:

the expense of Penn State, Temple
' other state-supported
schools.” By‘ logical extension,
this_unholy alliance could be not
only against University employees
and other students in our state, but
also against the elderly, the poor
and others “competing” for state
aid. A

Before we join this powerful
combination of “students-and-
Posvar against the world,” how-
ever, perhaps we should do a little

‘ more hard thinking.

First of all, why should students
trust the University administration
when the adminstration distrusts
the students? , The administration
is afraid toshare the actual details
_of Pitt’§ ﬁnances with the elected

A representatives of if the ’ student 7

body. These details are contained
in the (secret “level-one budget.” - I

What is the administration afraid
of?_ Will it really be necessary to
raise tuition, freeze hiring,» and
eliminatejobs and programs? How
much money isibeing spent on top
administrative salaries, on ' the
administration’s anti-unionization
activities, on war-related research
and on other dubious items? Open
the books. Show us. Letthe ‘entire
University community, participate

in these crucial financial delibera- .

tions. . . .
Secondly, to -be quite frank, the
University administration (doesn’t
represent that huge a social or
political force. It has clout only to
the extent that it carries out the
decisions ‘of our corporate-dom-
inated Board of Trustees. ’ Of
course, the corporations are power-
ful, but if it comes to a choice
between their proﬁts or the inter-
ests of the students, corporate
proﬁts will come out on top every
time. ‘
We think Pitt students would do
better to join together with Univer-
sity faculty and" employees, and
also with other campuses across
the state in calling for more aid to
education in general. And we
should consider reaching beyond

to be further..

working people and the poor are
most penalized by these education
cuts. We should be building links
with the organized labor movement
and with organizations of the poor

to fight these cut-backs. »~ -

Instead of simply appealing to the
legislators, trying to persuade
that money for Pitt “will result in
an optimum yield for Pennsyl-

vania,” we must appeal to the ‘

people who elect the legislators.

We must ‘strive to demonstrate to

children, on their future. And we
must begin to push for a system of
higher education that is increas-
ingly relevant and accessible to the
majority of the people.

In short, what we must accom-
plish is the creation of a ‘political
atmosphere in which the legislators
feel compelled to support the
improvement and expansion of
higher education. This involves not
simply private communications and
consultations with‘ politicians, but
public activities--meetings, rallies
and yes, even demonstrations--that
can attract the attention, capture

Judy Echoes Old Tunes
BY DOUG GEBHARD
Judith, Judy Collins, Elektra (7E-
1032) l!!!

Judy Collins does other writers’
material...and she does it well. No
matter what many may say, a good
interpretation of a good song is

better than no reﬂection or a weak
one.

' leaves her lovers for another.

Danny O'Keefe’s “Angel, Spread
Your Wings" is done in a bouncing
country air, with the backing
musicians giving a more than
ample full sound. The guitar work
of David Spinozza, Hugh McCrack-
en and Steve Burgh on this song
(and throughout the album) is
extremely well-directed. The
strength that these folks have had
on other lp’s is put on the back
burner, creating a full and rhyth-
mic session and needed leads when
apropos. ,

Hide the razor blades for this
album...that’s for certain. You
can’t call Judy Collins’ work “laid
back”...it’s more like already on
the bed. This albgm is so finely

0 mixed and produced it sounds at
times as if Arif Mardin had studied’
under Columbia Masterworks’
people. The orchestration is mas-
terfully added and executed,
whereas on his own lp it sounds

talks about this man in a "dream-
world who could be wearing a white

laden fence with a ceramic giraffe
next to him playing a Washburn
guitar.

Some surprise songs are the
Stones‘ “Salt of the Earth" and
Steve Goodman's “City of New
Orleans" (Steve plays on this cut,
as does Eric Weissberg. Weiss-
berg plays on a majority of the
tracks), “Brother, Can You Spare a
Dime?” and another classic, “I’ll
Be Seeing You.” She also does an
original tune “Song for Duke,” a
moving and sincere tribute to the
American classic. It tells of the
inﬂuence of his music and the

impact his funeral-< had on this '

writer. “This man was a hero/ He
sang the music of our souls/ He
knew that we all have in us/ A
place where beauty/ Always

BY G.W. STEVENS ,
The recent directive by the De-
partment of Health, Education and
Welfare that requires colleges and

. universities to spend comparable

sums of moneygon male and female
athletic programs is, on the sur-
face, a fair and long overdue
proposition.
- closer examination the directive is

  

7‘=il'l$onceived and can serve only to

downgrade the quality of college
athletics. .
Most universities are - primarily
one-sport schools, with the revenue
from the sport going 'to support the
remainder of the-athletic programs.
At Pitt the one sport is football,
which holds its own in the competi-
. tion for the Pittsburgh entertain-
ment dollar and ‘supplies the Uni-

versity athletic office with a sizable: t

annual budget. 

The ‘total yearly expenditure, for
the football program is nearly equal
to the combined budgets of the

-remainder of the athletic programs

(that is, if the basketball team is '

excluded from the analysis, since it
comes close to supporting itself
despite the second-largest budget
of all Pitt athletic programs). The
total expenditure on -minor male’
programs is in line with that laid
out for women-’s sports; but all
minor sports, male and female, are
allocated funds well under the total
of that of the football and basket-
ball programs.

The women’s athletic program at
Pitt is far better than it was just a
couple, of years ago. Forthe ﬁrst

 ﬁne, women can now come to the

 

University on athletic scholarships,
and the number of women’s pro-
grams has been increased to ﬁve
with the addition of track, volley-
ball and gymnastics. “However,

The glaring weakness in the
Pirate lineup is ﬁelding. Richie
Hebner made 28 errors last season
and Zisk is_ not exactly a great right
ﬁelder. Stargell, although pos-
sessing a good arm, is not one of
the quickest left ﬁelders around.
With Stargell and Zisk in the
outﬁeld, Oliver is forced to cover a
lot more ground than a center
ﬁelder should have to.

Tankers Close Season

Br TOM HALL

The 1974-75 swimming season is
coming rapidly to a close. Pitt’s
Swimming and Diving team has
shown marked improvement over
last season, finishing with a 7-3
record. .A second-place ﬁnish in
the Eastern Intercollegiate‘ Swim-
ming Invitational had to have been
a highlight in the four-year career
of Pitt Coach Dick Bradshaw. And
now for dessert--the NCAA Cham-
pionships at Cleveland State March
27-29. Again the Panthers will be
well represented. -

Distance swimmer Jerry DeMuro
set new pool marks in the 500 yard

freestyle (4:39.88) and in the 1650
(16:04.38) while qualifying for the
championships in both events.

‘ John Templin also qualiﬁed indi-
vidually for the 200 yard breast-
stroke (2:l2.34) during the Eastern
competition. '

Another pleasant surprise from
the Easterns was the performance
of the 400 yard medley relay team
of Santiago, Templin, Natali and
Schepner‘? Their time of 3:33.57
was good enough to make the trip
to Cleveland this weekend.

In the diving events, Coach Al
Coffey’s charges proved ‘them-
selves to be the best in the East,
making a runaway of the Invita-
tional diving events and assuring
themselves a chance at the
NCAA’s.

Dave .Reeder, who ﬁnished fourth
in the Easterns, and Jeff Miller,
who won the Eastern one-meter
event, will represent the Panthers
in the low board competition.

mark for the three-meter event

witha score of 333.25 against Kent .

Barcalow: Mentor 
  For Hockey club,

.o»‘

_ ‘BY STEVE SXBERZI‘. 
“ ‘Okay: Question time. What do

Red ~ Kelly, Gordie Howe, Stan
"Mikita,;Bobby Hull and Bobby Orr
- all have in common? True, they are

ﬁve of the great'est hockey-players

ever to. don skates, but here is the

real ‘answer_: They are all
C ‘;_acquaintances’T _of Pitt Hockey

Club mentor; Lenny Barcalow.

‘ Why the quotation marks? I

didn’t believe all his bull at ﬁrst, '

but after he introduced several Pitt
players to Bobby Orr, and myself ‘to
Ron Stackhouse, I quickly changed
my mind, although I was still a bit
hesitant to fully believe him.

I For, Coach Barcalow, being
constantly on the hockey scene is
the ideal life. He has spent the
better part of 40 years exposed to
hockey; during the last 14, he has
been coaching ‘in Pittsburgh
amateur leagues. _

“I went out to North Park one
day,” said Barcalow, reflecting
upon ‘his coaching debut, ‘~‘and,,
asked if I could skate with the
younger lads. There was a
shortage of coaclies to help those
guysf’ ' '

That makes you wonder "what the
65-year-old coach did before taking
up hockey instruction as his
favorite pastime.

“I was in- baseball for a long time,
but I always skated quite a bit,”
Barcalow said. “Then I found
there's more action in hockey. It's
faster and more exciting and the
players you deal with are a rare
breed.”

Barcalow worked as a coach in the
Pittsburgh Amateur Hockey
League and in the old Western
Pennsylvania Junior “B” League
before he was contacted to lead the
Panthers during the 1973-74
season. _

As you know, Pitt hockey has yet

to become a recognized varsity ‘

sport and lacks the funds that
accompany such recognition. As a
result, Barcalow is rewarded for his
efforts with only the satisfaction of
being with a winning club.

“Duke Schaffer (a former Pitt
skater) called me, and asked if I
could come over and coach the
guys,” he said. “After the ﬁrst
practice, the guys voted to keep me
on as the coach.” -

So, you may ask, “What has he
done?" _g How do a 37-5-2 record

titles in as many years grabgyou?
Originally from St. Catherines,
Ontario, Barcalow firmly believes

that to be effective a coach must be 

on the ice with the boys. Last year,
V though, while coaching South
Fayette High School, he learned

‘that you have to move around.
quickly when he was run ‘into the

boards and suffered _a brokenlleg.
An employee of the Allegheny
County Department of _Parks and

Recreation, Barcalow is known for ’

asserting the Panthers’
Vernon is the top éollegiate
in the state. --

“I have talked with several people
in the National Hockey League
regarding getting a try-out lined
up," -Barcalow said. “Rick is so
close you can just smell it.

‘‘I can’t see why the Penguins
pick up some guys,” he continues,
“when they have this guy in their
own backyard. I know he could

make it if only someone would take’

a look at him.”

Suppose Vernon does make it to
the pros and a guy comes up to you
at a game sometime and says,
“Hey, I know Rick Vernon. I
coached him in college."

Tell you what, just believe him.

3 Earlier this year Russell was

elected to the Basketball Hall of
Fame, as well he should have been.
However, Russell refused to attend‘
the induction ceremony, citing
personal reasons, and stated he did
not want to be inducted.

grams are valued beyond just what
they offer to the players. "Thou-
sands of silent participants are
involved, namely the fans. Since
there are many student fans at the
University who attend football and
basketball games and are very
much interested in the success of
the teams, the expenditure can be
justified to some extent.

The purpose of college athletic
programs should not be just to give
a few interested students some-
thing to do with their extra time.
The expenditure of thousands of
dollars is a gigantic waste in that
respect and can be better used

elsewhere in the University com-
munity, perhaps to strengthen the
intramural program that comes
much closer to meeting the needs
of the students.

If we wish to consider everyone--
male and female--as equals with
the same opportunities, then we
also must accept the equality of
athletes and non-athletes. And, if
the federal government can de-
mand more money be spent on
women’s programs, why doesn’t
the government initiate legislation
that would force athletic depart-
ments to spend as much money on
non-athletes (through intramural
programs) as they spend on ath-
eletes? ~

Boardlgnores Russell

(Continued from Page 9)

standard procedure, the Hall's
Board of Directors will not induct
Russell unless he attends a dinner.

The directors’ reasoning is simple
to them; but then, they are simple
people. If someone has died or is in
the hospital and can’t leave, he will
be pardoned from attending.
Russell's personal reasons aren't
acceptable.

Originally, the Board voted to
revoke Russell’s election, but later
they graciously amended that
proposal. Instead, a 10-foot-high
stained glass window will be placed

in the Springfield, Massachusetts
shrine along with those of 93 other
members.

The-Big Man's piece of glass will
be on the symposium with the other
inductees’ next month but already
will have been unveiled, with no
mention of it made.

Russell‘ has stated he will not
attend the induction because of
personal reasons. Why can't the
Board leave it alone? The man who
has done so much for basketball
and is still involved--as coach of the
Seattle Supersonics--should be
allowed to do what he thinks is

right.

Just because he won’t stand in
front of a group of gawking
spectators one more time to see a
stained glass _unveiled is no reason
for the Board to act as though he
never existed. The Board of
Directors has blown what started
out to, be an easy assignment l3y:¥,.;__
letting big heads stand in the way. A V
I agree with Russell.

If he doesn’t want to attend, good
for him.

4. NEW YORK METS--The Mets

:"’“.*.r-ave probably the best left-handed

pitcher. in the league in Jon
Matlack. Matlack is a solid
performer who last year posted a
2.41 ERA, but because of weak
hitting could manage only a 13-15
record.

Matlack should be very happy
now. Met hitting has improved
considerabley with the addition of
Joe Torre and Dave Kingman to the
Mets’ lineup.

The Mets’ outﬁeld leaves much to
be desired. Cleon Jones is
consistent, but Rusty Staub has
proven a great disappointment to
the Mets. The addition of Gene

 Clines and Del Unser could bolster

- /

the fielding but neither of them can l .

hit with power.
A good season from Seaver and

Koosman could pull the Mets past J

the Phillies.

5. CHICAGO CUBS--The Cubs I

are in the process of rebuilding,
and therefore are chock full of
youth and inexperience. Andre
Thornton broke into the starting
lineup last season at first base and
turned in a fine performance, as
did third baseman Bill ,Madlock.

Bill Grabarkewitz,will play second
base for the Cubs and the “old
man" Don Kessinger will be at
shortstop.  I A ' 

T“:--. Rick Monday, Jerry Morales and

I  al responsible service.

Jose Cardenal_will try to hold the
line at the outfield positions, and
could do a lot of running, as Cub
pitching should allow much in the
way of long balls.

6. MONTREAL EXPOS--The two
best players on the Montreal club
last season are no longer with the
team. Gene Mauch is faced with

.i7MTF1ie problem of having to rebuild
the entire squad. A poor-hitting

inﬁeld, coupled with an unproven
outfield--although the acquisition
of Rich Coggins could change
that--is the Expo story.

Saying the Montreal pitching staff I

is poor is being charitable. The
Expos traded away their best
pitcher in Mike Torrez and must
put a pitching staff together out of
unproven quantities and leftovers.

The Pantherette Synchronized
Swimming team held a water show
Friday and Saturday entitled “Sa-
lute to the Stars, Aquacade ’75,” in
keeping with the theme of activities
of other groups on campus. The
show featured the synchronized
team, the synchronized class and
the Pittsburgh Synchronettes, an
AAU team.

‘‘I was pleased with the perfor-
mance of the team,” Coach Vir-
ginia Grindle commented. “But
the turnout by the students was

A very disappointing.”

The team used its water show to
prepare for the upcoming Midwest
Intercollegiate Routine Competi-
tion, which it will host April 5 and
6. Thirty-four universities and
colleges will attend.
