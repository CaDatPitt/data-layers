stitutional racism; a sense of pow-_
erless and alienation among large

_ numbers of people.

We are committed to the strug-
gle for socialism and opposed to

any anti-democratic principle as‘

a basis for governmental, social,
or political org’anization.’Our con-
ception of socialism is both re-
volutionary and democratic. We
believe that the needs of the peo-

ple can only be fully met when

people take control of the poli-
tical, social and economic institu-
tions which shape their lives. So-
cialism is above all, democracy —
a system in which the socio-
economic institutions which affect
the Iives of all people in society
are controlled by the people and
are democratically administered
in the interests of all.

We affirm our. solidarity with
popular struggles against oppres-
sion everywhere in the world.
We support the struggles for na-
tional liberation and self-deter-
mination of all oppressed peoples.
We see our activity as a part of the
struggles of youth, black and
brown peoples, women. and work-
ing people for liberation. '

We are fighting for the fun-
damental transformation of the
university into a social institu-

' tion relevant to the crises with-

in our society.

We believe in the necessity of,

civil liberties within society and

internal democracy within our‘

organization. Our organization is
open to all who share this per-
spective.

Pre-moruto ri um

by KATHY JOYCE
Staff News Writer

“Let’s begin Wednesday, Oc-
tober 15, to break down our walls
of apathy and ignorance.” Ted
Harding, organizer of the mora-
torium, stated this basic message
at the Pre-moratorium rally last
monday at noon on the Cathe-

. dral lawn. -

He continued that the break-
ing down of walls is not enough,
and that “we must change peo-
ples’ heads.” Herebuked those
who criticize the anti-war move-
ment and also those who neither
know the facts about the war,,
nor care to know about them.
“No one can say we are not
fighting for freedom. We have a
duty to do something about
that. We are getting together to
learn what the war means in
Vietnam and at home,” he said.

Briefly, he explained the sche-
dule for the moratorium. ‘.‘On

Wednesday, there will be a day- V

long program of different acti-
vities,’ he began, to turn us on to
the hard realities of the war.”

In accordance with this objec-
tive, a demonstration of the destruc-
tive effects of napalm and
speeches on the history, morality
and political opposition to the
Vietnam war will be given on
the cathedral lawn. He further
stated that “we will then march
downtown as a peaceful demon-
stration to show that‘ the atroci-
ties must stop —- that society must
change toward different goals.
He concluded that many people —
members of both the community

and colleges — will come to-

gether “to grow and create a new
and better world.”

The second ‘ speaker was Al’

Rojas of the United Farm Work-
ers Organizing Committee. “You
are processed,’ he began, ‘like
nuts and bolts. You have your
body on the line to die for an un-
just war, an immoral war, a bad
war.” He stated that college stu-

dents are “actors, puppets. They

(the decision—making ~officials)
pull the strings.” He continued by
comparing the war at home to the
war in South east Asia. “The
minority groups must fight the
same battle in the ghetto and im-
poverished areas as in Vietnam
because they are not given the
proper tools to improve, and build
a better America.”

“.No more war,’ he concluded,
‘no more bombs, no more killing.
Let it end now! ”

Joseph White of the History
Department was the final speak-
er. In an analysis of wars, socie-
ties and movements, he began on
a . pessimistic note. “No anti-
war movement has ended a war.”
“But,’ he offered, “unsuccessful

military adventures have caused
the downfall of imperialistic so-
cieties.” He cited “such worthies”
as Czar~Nicholas, Kaiser Wil-
helm, and more recently L.B.J.
as “victims of imperialist buc-
caneering.”

“Even if the war is ended
within the next 18 months, ‘he
went _on, ‘the real danger is that
it is all to possible that the eco-

nomic and social situation will’

still be with us,” and they could
eventually precipitate another
war. “The presence of a far left-
will be crutial,’-’ he further stated.
Then,” he concluded “the intel-
lectual elite must find social
change to liquidate this war and
end all Vietnams.”

RELOCATEES AND TRANSFERS TO MEET

, The purpose of RSO is to facilitate

the complete participation of re-
locates and transfers in Oakland
activities. l

Host Mike Edelstein explained
the immediate need for housing
adjustmentsfor those who trans-
fer into Oakland. Also, registra-
tion and orientation facilities need
to be expanded for relocates and
transfers.

Tentative plans are being made
to take campus leaders to regional
campuses in order to stimulate
students interest and to from a
connection between Oakland and

— regional activities. Also, regional

campus students may come to
Oakland to orient themselves with
main campus activities.

Edelstein summed up RSO as a
“flexible organization soon to be
recognized as an established stu-
dent activity, with an elected
chairman and a representative
from each regional campus.”

The next meeting of RSO is
scheduled for Oct. 30 on the 12th
floor of the Cathedral of Learning.
All students who have been relo-
cated from one of the regional
campus or who have transferred
to the University of Pittsburgh

Pitt News Analysis

Pre-Moratorium F alters

by BOB GIN G
Staff Writer

A beautiful fall day set the
scene for a pre—moratorium rally
on the Cathedral lawn, Monday at
noon. About 200 sat and heard the
program, which was sponsored
by the Revolutionary Socialist Un-
ion.

Compared with the other prep-
arations for the moratorium, this
rally was very blase. The unim-
pressive group of speakers in-
cluded Ted Harding, and the his-
tory department’s own Joe White.

Amid barrages of cliche, and
other worn-out explanations about
the war, Harding, the first speak-
er, came up with one refreshing
analogy. He called on the assem-
bly to break down the wall of ig-
norance that surrounds the war,
and to break down the wall of apa-
thy. He compared the situation of
the people in America to the sit-
uation of a people in prison. These
were the walls which we had to

break in order to have our free-
dom.

Al Rojasof the migrant grape
workers was the only fresh face
to speak at the rally, but even he
seemed to be a bit overimpressed
with the entire situation. Of Oct.
15, he said, “For the first time in
American history, the people will
say no to those who make deci-
sions.” Obviously, he has missed
the many rallies, demonstrations
and varied methods of saying no,
that the black people of America
have been using for over a decade,
not to mention the Civil War, or
Democratic Convention in Chicago
last summer.

Rojas’ observations on the Uni-
versity were far closer to the real
thing than were his predictions of

Oct. 15. He said that the Universi-_ ‘

ty is ’a machine which turns out
nuts and bolts that screw into the
establishment machine. On the
war, Rojas wondered how we
could possibly try to solve the

he Magic Man

“Magic is not for everyone. It
belongs to the gods and only
those who are chosen by the gods
are ever permitted to learn it.
Thus, I will train only those who
the gods allow to pass two tests.”

AND SO, IT'soon happened that
all of the young boys tried their
luck with the magic man’s tests.
The first was very difficult. Each
boy. had to venture alone into
the wilderness, wressel a killer-
bull, and then kill it with his
bare hands. Of the 100 boys who
ventured forth, only 50 were
chosenby the gods. '

lThe second test was» much
easier. Each boy had to sacri-
fice 10 cows, 6 _sheep, 10 chic-
kens,‘ and 12 eggs and make a
gift of these objects to themagic
man. But, many of the villagers
were very poor and only the
rich families were » able to
make the sacrifice.

And so, the magic manbegan
to train the boys..He made them
memorize magic chants, string
magic beads, and he"used them to

, help him with his magic spells

'for_ the chieftan. - e _
.But, the magicﬁman wanted

only the strongest and-‘bravest’

young ,men to" learn ,his magic

- and so he tested the boysgagain.
and again by having them fight I

mock battles against one another.

The most skilled warrior r was

paws. Those that failed com-
pletely were, of course, dead.

AND IT CAME TO PASS
that one of the boys, a strong and
intelligent boy who had won
many Antolepe.’s horns, began to.
think about the magic and to
become disatisfied with the
magic man.

“Something’s wrong,” he told
his friend, "‘l’ve memorized the
chants, I can say magic spells,
and I can cook magic potions.
But, I don’t feel like a magic
man; I- don’t really know what
the magic is.”

And it‘ came to pass thatone

day he stole the. ancient scrolls

and hid himself deep" in the
woods where he could study and
search for the secret of the magic.
For many days and nights he
and then,_ one night,.

he found it.

(Editor's Note:
an active member of
vanced ROIC corps. She also
works in Public Relations for the
Brigade)

In September, 1967, I entered
the-University, of Pittsburgh’ as
a freshman .— not in an abstract
search for the truth as so many
like to see their presence here,
but to make myself qualified for
a better job than that of a high-
school_-‘trained stenographer.

It was, and still is, my purpose
to be a lawyer. During this first
term, I noticed on every Tues-
day a good many men all over
the campus wore either Army or
Air Force uniforms , as ROTC
cadets. ‘

As I came to meet people in
the ROTC programs, I develop-

services I and the’ programs and
people therein. _ ‘   :
Early-‘in the following .-term,
I visited,‘ the WAC Selection Of-
ficer; in Pittsburgh tolelear‘-n what
the military’ could offer me‘. It

a was then that ‘I‘_ discovered two

programs. ‘ ' r .
 These programs ' _ were the
' W AC College ‘Junior Program and

"jthe WAC -Student Officer Pro-‘.

gram. . -The former ~ consisted of

-spending four weeks as_ a Cadet
\ Corporal at‘ Ft.~“McClellan,-.Ala- -

of a corporal ‘and theft‘ option of
‘ cfhoosing“'to” enter the‘ ~Army7

officer _or_'to be. discharged‘ at. the
.,end ‘of the period with

The latter-ca_rr_iedl a. greater_

..On completionof the College
Juni_or.‘Program, one ‘could enter
the, Student Officer Program -as
a corporal.in* the U'.S. ~Army Re-' '

college 'drawii_1g full pay, allow-'
ances, and benefits, a total of _about

' $390 peremonth.

Following her graduation and
commissioning, the Student
Officer receives orders to report

Officer ‘Basic Course. Including
this training her obligation to

  ROTC Programs Offer 
Benefits To Women  

,Having considered these 'pro- ‘I

grams, ‘I thought taking ROTC
would provide me with train-
ing and experience that would
help me in the College Junior"
Program. I-cannot take thevcredit
for being the_ first girl -in ROTC
at Pitt, but I was the first to
wear a uniform and drill with“
the men." ‘

I gained in my classes» prac-
tical knowledge of military" sci-.
ence as «well as an opportunity‘
to know both cadets and cadre
members as being people each
having ‘his -own -in‘dividual5per-
sonality and feelings which did
not disappear behind a common
uniform. ‘

Never in my ROTC training-

was I submitted to any way of
political thought to which mem-
bers of the military. should con-
form (to date I have completed
the basic course and half of_ the
advanced .course) we were
never kept from
ourselves. ‘

Tape Tells All  

  Moorhead   Analysis Rapped

Editor, The Pitt News,

I recently attended the
speech '- lecturegiven by Con-
gressman William Moorhead on
the military — industrial com-
plex. Although I was not parti-
cularly‘ favorable impresed by

~ the speech, I considered the Pitt

News editorial and critical re-.
‘view by Miss Virginia‘ Joyce t;
have been a much greater’ fail-M

lure. I did not 1 object‘ to Miss

Joyce’s socioeconomic and poli-.

tical positions which seemed to
influence "subtly her <Niticism,

but I did. find fault with Miss *

Joy/ce’s analysis in areas vital to

responsible and resaonable jour-f
nalisticspeech criticism-2. - ‘

' Miss Joyce’s" criticism failed
in four vitalareas. First, Miss
Joyceboth misquoted and poorly-
‘paraphrased the .Congressman’s

remarks.‘—CI happened to" record.

 the speech and I_ verified these

problems from the-tape"re’cord-’

‘Congressman ‘ contradicted‘ ‘s him- .

other hand wanting more money

was not a contradiction in one

‘ sense-‘because Moorhead was not

Joyce meant superiority. ‘Con-
gressman Moorhead explained to
Miss Joyce when «she question-

eds him that"de'terence did not-

necessarily mean superiority in
weaponry. Miss Joyce failed to
take this
criticism.
Third, Miss Joyce exaggerated
some of the remarks and took
them out of context. Miss Joyce I

implied that the speech was a ’

harangue against Nixonand. that

l the speech seemed to be motiva-

ted» by political opportunism.

 On Drugs

by MARC HILLER, Chairman
Drug Seminar Committee

_ , At long last the drug scene is
 finally going to be explored right
7 out in the open-not behind closed
doors, not for a select audience,
 and not supressed by any ruling
' 1 body. “From pot to psychedelics,”
from bennies to heroine, and
from supplies to ‘user, the arena
shall be open. The Forum On
Drugs (Oct. 23, 24, and 25) will
attempt to present the so-called
“drugged generation” in perspec-
tive. A total awareness of all of

 _ aim of the program.

_ Student participation will be
stressed in the informal atmosphere

_ 7 in which panel discussions, guest

. lecturers, student led dialogs,

and films will be prsented.

. .. Many facts will be made known,

"maybe many will find answers to

their questions, but everyone will

-_ be left to make his own decision

’ as to whether drugs are for him.

In other words the decision is

 

ours-yours and mine. Both
 viewpoints will be expressed by
' ' highly recognized and well-

’ respected men and eachwill be
_ stressed on an equal basis through-
I out the forum.

 

‘Speaking on the fositive side
will be Paul Krassner, who has
, willingly bucked the establish-
; _ment and asked the question:
 drugs spoil the system?
" As the founder and editor of the
Realist, his voice oas been echoed
‘A V. from coast to coast.

 

“For the past ten years
Krassner has been hacking away
. g at society’s sacred cows — mother-
1‘ . hood‘, the Pope, sexual mores, the
flag (and himself) —- with cor-

‘ __ rosive, outrageous humor.

As editor of the Realist, Krass-
ner finds himself the precur-
sor and perhaps the dean of the
underground press.” Krassner will
tell it like he sees it and openly
tell anyone to do “it” if he wants
to.

 

   
  

the issues concerning drugs is the

Page  PITT NEWS-—Wednesday, October 15, 1969

Krassner: “If I had one thing
to tell every body, it would be-
do it now! Take up music, read
a book, proposition a girl — but
do it now. We‘ know we are all
sentenced to ‘death. People cannot
become prisoners of guilts and
fears. They should cling to each
moment and take what enjoy-
ment they can from it‘. . . . ”

_ The message he is bringing to
the University will be long rem-
‘ membered as his words when he

led the Yippies at the 1968 De-_

mocratic. National Convention in
Chicago. “You caall the kids who
came to Chicago to protest at the
convention a movement. I call
them a community which has been
joined together by the gut educa-
tion they have learned on the
streets. The main result cg the
Chicago demonstrations is the
changed consciousness of Am-
ericaand of the kids who were
there.”

Taking the opposing viewpoint
will be Robert Moorman, past as-
sociate of Timothy Leary and ex-
addict. Moorman has turned on,
tuned in, and dropped out and
during these years he experiment-
ed with marijuana, morphine,
heroine, L.S.D. mescaline, solvents
and glues, romalar, amphetamines
(pep pills) anp various other
assorted pills from time to time.

The end of the road for the
drug dependent Robert Moor-
man came in 1966 when he was ar-
rested in Tampa, Florida for grand
larseny and possession of nar-
cotics. During his confinement be-
hind the fences of the Florida
State and County Prison System,

Robert Moorman began a most ‘

painful and agonizing rehabilita-
tion. It is of these and other ex-
periences that Moorman will
speak during the Forum on Drugs
in his lecture, “The Burning Is-
sue.”

As the Drug Seminar Com'mit- ..
tee bringing the Forum on Drugs
to Pitt, we can only urge every-

one to go and hear these men as

Education Retreat

Wednesday, October 15, 1969--THE PITT tmws’-_,:-..g;.:7

\,

Requirements Changed  

Interested University faculty,
Pittsburgh Board of Education
members, and three students
from the Educational Cabinet held
a retreat at Camp Kon-0-Kwee
last week-end. Students Marlene
Walker, Beth Grosser, and Cabi-
net head Jeanne Katz participated
in_ .a seminar involving future
changes which could occur in the
School of Education’s present
curriculum.

Unstructured discussion groups
focused on such problems as the
QPA requirement for entrance in
the School of Education, lack of
black studies and special educa-
tion, and the urban problems in-
volved in teaching in ghetto areas.

Many expressed hopes of teaching
experiences in the freshman year
which may weed out those who
should not decide to go into educa-
tion.

The week-end succeeded not
only in improving communica-
tions between students, but also
was responsible for the following
changes in general criteria:

I( Humanities requirement is
now 15 credits, with the only spe-
cified courses being English I and
II.

2) Social Sciences and Natur-
al Sciences are nine credits each
(No required courses).

3) Academic major: 24 credits
and no requirements.

1:555’

...VA N I-IE U s E N”

/

   

4) General Electives increased
from three to nine credits.

Miss Katz commented, “The
faculty and others present were
very receptive to our suggested
changes’, but we need more stu-
dent involvement. So far only stu-
dents from the elementary educa-
tion department have shown any
interest, and we know there is
secondary education here at Pitt.
And where are the male students,
especially those who are going
into education to dodge the draft?”

Any students, whether directly
involved with the School of Educa-
tion or not, may attend Cabinet
_ meetings at 8 p.m. Tuesdays at
506 SU.

 Panther Defense
Limits Rushers

by ED CON LEY
Staff Sports Writer

17.‘.

Disastrous seasons in the
what it’s like to go nowhere.

past have shown the Panthers
So, naturally, the Jungle Cats

are jubliant over the fact that the opposition’s rushers have
been limited to minus one yard in the last two wdeks.

Saturday, the Panther defense
proved that its performance against
Duke a week earlier wasn’t a
fluke. At the end of the

triumph over Navy the stat sheets
indicated that the Middies had
gained nothing on the ground.
But Coach Carl DePasqua isn’t
ready to boast an unpenetrable
defense.

“For the most part we hit
hard and we were where we were
supposed to be,” DePasqua said.
“But, we still have some break-
downs in certain positions. We
are getting poised, though, and
we’re gaining confidence.

“We have a new defense this
year. And we’re staying with
it. It’s a matter of constant im-
provement. ’ ’

When asked if he thought the

defense was doing the "job
against the run in the first two
games this fall, DePasqua

smiled and returned with, “What
do you think?” ’
That was the coach’s way of
saying that the statistics backed
up the play of the tackling unit.

  Booters Shutout Grove City, 3-0;
Invade Ohio With Even Record

by BILL NAAB

After the booters smothered
Grove City, 3-0, yesterday at
Forbes Field, the Grover team
was silenced somewhat.

Before the match began. the
Grove City soccermen burst onto
the Forbes Field turf blistering
the atmosphere with loud animal-
like noises. “They were proud.
They were looking for an unde-
feated season. They had aggres-
siveness, height, and speed, and
they never quit,” remarked Leo
Bemis.

Nevertheless, Grove City did
not devour the 1-2-1 soccer team.

In fact. the Grovers were com-
pletely overmatched. The shots-
on-goal statistic is the most ob-
vious indication as to just who
controlled the game. Grove City
attempted only eight shots. while
the booters went to the nets 28
times.

“We outpassed them and out-
shot them. With a little better
shooting we could have turned it
into a rout. We should’ve had
about three more goals,” Bemis
stated.

Forward Chucho Valencia ‘ex-
pressed similar optimism.
“We’ve been scoring well, and

two shutouts in a row is really
great. To me. sometimes. it
seems like pro ball. We don’t hold
the ball too long, and everyone
has been playing real well."

Valencia began yesterday’s
scoring. At the 18-minute mark of
the first period. Chucko took a
pass from Dave DiEmidio and
booted a belt-high kick into the nets
straight away from about eight
yards out.

Late in the second period, Gus
Theopholis received a Lou Vida
pass, set himself up to the right
of the opposing goalie, and then
viciously slammed the ball in for
a score. ‘

 

Tony Nicholocouplos scored at
the 19-minute mark of the final
period. He took control of the ball
from 18—yards out, then mmaneu-
vered tmthe 12-yard line before
booting the ball intmthe far cor-
ner of the net.

Neither Theopholis nor Nicholo-
couplos started the game. In fact.
Theopholis had his leg in a cast as
late as last Thursday. But the
forward rested over the weekend
and felt ready to face Grove City.

Bemis enjoyed an all-out team
effort, though. “Mike Pincus had
his best game so far. He really
came through, but everyone play-

. ed good ball,” said Bemis.

The.witches are loose on the
second floor of the Student
Union. They drink in the potion
of students’ problems and brew
up immediate concoctions which
solve all dilemmas and put a smile
on the face. According to the
chief warlock. they get "all the
dirt in the culture.”

If this sounds like a descrip-
tion of the Counseling Center, it’s

ifftinfortunate. There has been an
“aura of witchcraft associated

with counseling that scares
away students and presents a to-

tally inaccurate picture of what

"i

 

‘\

counseling can mean.

Because of these misconcep-
tions, 75 per cent of the stu-
dents who seek an ear for their
problems be they motivational,
vocational or personal, have
“heard it through the grapevine.”
The Center does not advertise.

eight-member staff is the idea
that only the seriously ill need a
counselor.

The Center deals with emotion-
al upsets as common as the break-
up between two steady daters
or the general feeling of isola-
tion and misdirection that many
students experience upon enter-
ing a large urban university.

More serious problems are re-
ferred to the Student Health Cen-
ter, Western Psychiatric Hos-
pital or private psychiatrists.

The counselors at the Center
do not pretend to offer ready-

made solutions to the bevy of -.

problem-situations that it hand-
les.

Dr. Warren Hill, Director, sum-
med up his approach as “re-
lationship counseling. "’ “Problems
are solved through the process of
engaging experienced, sophisti-
cated interested personnel that
the student can rapidly get to
know because complete confi-
dentiality has been built into
their careers,” he explained.

You’re not as mini as usual? It’s only temporary,
you know. A monthly problem. But who cares when
you have that puffy, bloated, "Oh, I'm so fat feeling”?
TRENDAR, that's who. TRENDAR’LL help keep you
slim as you are all month long. Its modern diuretic
(water-reducing) action controls temporary pre-men-
strual weight gain. (That can be up to 7 pounds!) Start
taking TRENDAR 4 to 7 days before that time. It'll help
make you look better and feel better.

Confidentiality is a big fac-
tor. No records are kept and no
information whatsoever is re-
leased to graduate schools,
Deans, parents or the FBI, with-
out the individual’s express con-
sent. '

Not only are the records con-
fidential but the personnel also.
Dr. Hill finds that he must gen-
erally remain “vague and invis-
so that students can talk
to him about their hang—ups and
not run into him on campus every
day.

The staff reflects this commit-
Currently, the Coun-
seling center boasts an enlarged
staff of four full-time counsel-
ors, three counseling interns
and a counselor-librarian.

Mrs. Sara Fine, one of the new
interns, defined the ideal coun-
seling situation as one in
which “there are two people,
both of whom are interested in
the same person.”

“But it takes skill to guage
when a student can ‘understand
himself and deal with his prob-
lems within the counseling rela-
tionship. We \don’t tell anyone
what he should do,” she offered.

The two new black interns are

handling themseli/es with a dif-

ferent attitude than the one of

“invisibility.” Moses Stith, a
seminarian at the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary, spends

more than thirteen hours a week «

on the second floor and more than
that “being a friend.”

“I want to relate to. black stu-
dents, as a friend, in the pool
room, in the Towers’ lobby,—at a
dance. It’s important for me to
become visible in the communi-
ty so that black students will
trust me,” explained Stith.

In the area of vocational coun-
seling, the Center has set up an

‘extensive library of career in-

formation,
Fakles.

-Attempting to focus on the
problems of the world of work
and the self, Miss Fakles has
garnered a comprehensive '
collection of career briefs, per-

handled by Tedie

iodicals and even novels, sorting .

out the propaganda and striving

— for objectivity.

“We try to put students in con-
tact with people already in the
field they are interested in and
to, explain the personal qualifica-
tions required. We even have a
coffee pot up here, when it
works,” she smiled. -

The library is sponsoring a ser-
ies of career seminars to be held‘
on the five Wednesdays in Octo-
ber. The seminars bring in people
from different professions for
round -table discussion groups.

In addition to vocational and, r 
personal advice, the Counseling , ’ V 1
Center manages Peripetesis, an" '

informal discussion group deal-"

ing with current issues, the Open .

Circle, run along the same lines;
and the Student-Faculty Lun-
cheon series.

It’s too bad that onlyi10 per

cent of the student body takes ad-
vantage of the Center’s services.

There’s no fee, no waiting around '

and no hocus,-pocus.

Parents Weelgend: New Format

This year, an effort has been
made to increase the relevance of
Parents’ Weekend by providing
participating parents with the op-
portunity to develop a perspective
on the academic, social and politi-
cal repercussions of the present
University climate. Consequently,
the Student Steering Committee
has revised the program format.

At the Chancellor’s Reception,
Friday evening, Dr. Posvar and
Bernard Kobosky. vice—chancel-
lor of Student Affairs, will ad-
dress the parents on current cam-
pus issues. Discussion groups
Owill follow, dealing more specifi-
cally with these stated issues. Re-
source people from all levels of
the University will be available at
this time to clarify _and supply in-
formation as group leaders.

Robert E. Young, executive as-
sistant to the chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee
will lead a discussion on the Fi-
nancing of Public Education. Scott
Baum, president of Student Gov-
ernment, will discuss Student
Government Revisions. A dis-
cussion of Black students in the
University community will be
headed by Dr. Lloyd Bell, assis-
tant vice—chancellor for Program
Development and Public Affairs,
and by Chenits Pettigrew, assis-
tant to the dean of students. Wom-
ens’ Liberation, Security in the
Dorms, ROTC and a number of
other topic areas will be treated.

A full schedule of the weekend’s
events includes:
