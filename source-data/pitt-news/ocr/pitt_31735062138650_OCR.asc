Rushing Terminates  
For Men Tomorrow.

- Eight men’s social fraternities, now in the midst of springs
rushing, will continue their programs until 2 o’clock Sunday,-
morning, when silence period will begin.

George Smith, IF rushing chairman, reported: ‘ ~
“There were few complaints of pre-rushing, so now let’s

[keep the

slate clean by really observing silence rules. We are

all fraternity men. We all must give other fraternities the
respect we will and should expect from them.”
 Most of the fraternities are planning informal meetings}
at thiiir houses tonight; these affairs must be over by mid-

night.

, _ Mixed house dances, which will be the last contact _with‘»
freshmen, will be held tomorrow night and must be ended by,

2 o’clock Sunday morning.
‘ After that dance, all contactwith

freshmen must cease. During silenc ”""“"

period, which lasts until-5 o’clock
next Thursday afternoon, this regu
lation includes luncheons, house
gatherings and -even conversations
about fraternity matters."

The fraternities will select the
rushees they'desire for member-
ship on Sunday afternoon, March
5. The bids, on the prescribed
forms and sealed, must" be sub-
mitted to the olﬁce of the dean of
men by 10 ’o’clock Monday morn-
ing. These bids will be issued to
the rushees through that oﬂice as
quickly as possible.

During the ' period of silence a
rushee may -notify the ofﬁce of the
dean of men of his choice of a fra-
ternity. At 5 o’clock next Thursday
each fraternity will receive the ac-
ceptances and declinations recorded
by. their rushees. . .

Students who have been pledged
to a fraternity and who are released
from pledgeship through personal or
fraternity action are ineligible for

 

pledgeship in another fraternity for‘/,\,‘

three school months.

Adds Volumes
To Shelves

If you have the time . to sit
through a double feature movie, for-
get the cinema and sit down with a
copy of Stephen Leacock’s latest
short stories, “Happy Stories”
(Dodd Mead Pub., N. Y., 1944.) This
new volume is on the shelves of the
Alldred library on the 6th floor of
the Cathedral (former CATS balli-

probably remember it. longer than
the double feature, as the tales are

full of characters who become cari-
catures under the author’s witty
pen.
Less amusing but more inform-

ative is Nathan Strauss’ “Seven
Myths Housing.” (Albert A.
Knopf, N. 'Y., 1944.) Here Strauss,’
former U. S. Housing Administra- , t
for and member of the New York 1
Housing Authority, refutes many
of the fallacies concerning hous-
ing. Among the myths are" the
‘_‘There are no slums in my town l”.
“The slum dweller creates the
slums!” “Public housing does not»
rehouse families from the slums.” .
_ Ten world famous authors banded
together to write “The Ten- Com-
mandments,’?— a ten-fold denuncia-
tion of Hitlerian atrocities. -The
book contains ten short novels
which illustrate.Hitler’s career. Au-
thors are Thomas Mann,» Rebecca
West, Franz Werfel,‘who tells a dra-

- matic story of a Rabbi whotwistis

a swastika into the form of a cross,

Bruno Frank, John Erskine, Andre

Louis Bromﬁeld, Sigrid Undset, and
Jules Romains,‘ who points ‘out the

A graduate of Missouri State
Teachers College and the Univer-
sity of Missouri, Dr. _Oliver re-‘
ceived his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Wisconsin. He has
done more than make a life study
of American history, though; he
has felt the width and breadth of
America, its greatness and its
short-comings. For him, Ameri-
ca’s contribution to world knowl-
edge is the development of her
technology, the lifting of the bur-
den of heavy toil from the back
of man. It is this theme that he
teaches Pitt students in his “His-
tory of American, Technology”
course. A

Appropriately, Dr.- Oliver can
claim - a part in making American
history, for he is an honorary chief.-

fife  Flaws‘, -

By HEWITT FOX
With the end of the semester in

“sight, several companies have mo-

mentarily turned their thoughts

'from'textboqks and exams to the

lighter things in life: company
dances.

Company .F «is perfecting its
plans for a “big deal” this Wednes-
day night at the Hotel Webste
Hall.

Last Saturday night Company
A gave their dance at the
Webster with the music supplied
by Skip Strahl and his orchestra.
Ice cream, cookies, and punch
were provided for those who
couldn’t get into the Boot‘ and
Saddle. Everyone had a big time
including Don “Honey Bunny”
Johnson who captured the eve-
ning’s wolﬁng honors with his

,- predatory. prowling around, the

.-dance ﬂoor. .
"Company E danc"e last week was

strictly “zoot.” Upon entering the

door,‘ men were confronted by
armed guards, resplendent in white
gloves and belts. Highlight of the

Company News ,. . .

f? thing strangely familiar about that

evening was a pageant put on by
the Co. E Sabers which were
vaguely reminiscent of Gilbert and
Sullivan.

Several sections of German stud-
ents in Co. H gave a kommers
(beer bust to you) last Thursday
night at Webster Hall (there’s s3me-

iiame). Main attraction of the eve-
ning, however, was a sorority “hen”

party down the hall—which is where
most of the students ended up.

Berthole Jekel, the boy with the
bedroom eyes, suffered a setback
in his love-life recently. With
high hopes he dashed downtown
to pick up his date, only to be met
by her kid sister _who dragged
him out to her house where'his
date was conﬁned with a bad cold.
Jekel might have spent $1 quiet
eveningat home with the‘ folks if
things hadn’t been further com.-
plicated by friends and relatives
who kept popping in and out, un-
til he ﬁnally managed to tear»him-
self away. V ,

Just recently, a number of fellows
yﬂompany _A were privileged to
dgxiess a demonstration in the ﬁeld
_.£—9hynotics given by “Rajah Omar”
Qhappell, the first plat’oon’s‘gift to
tfmystical Indian art. Mr. Chap-
ltehas made a study of hypnotism
“ice he was 19-—at the present time
‘Still 19.

Thehypnotic seance began at 8
-M.,‘AMr. Chappell having selected

‘ ffgiiinea pig”_ a few minutes be-
The trainee‘ was seated prop-

- n his chair-—hands resting on
e,s§f both feet flat on the floor,

, yfrelaxed —- and instructed to
 .;sé_‘ his eyes. With about two min-
 Jgof, ‘.‘Sleep, deeper, deeper, deep-
‘, sleep -— deeper, deeper, deeper
op?’ .4— the vcitim was brought
rgmpletely under the Rajah’s ’con-

>s, The.‘-Rajah speaks in al’sooth-
")” ureamy voice. “You are under
1 power, V Ynu cannot open
eyes.‘ You niustnow obey
commands.” After this..mes-
geffof assurance, the'Rajah paus-
';then says, “Your right arm is
m__pletely paralyzed. You will
'  able to feel an'ything.’’_
_, taking a lighted cigarette,
1 1' it over the tips of his vic-
sﬁngers.-v'L‘he victim’s reﬂexes
, 01; respond. He feels nothing.

1 ‘fter ‘another pause the Rajah
 gain uspealis, “Your arm is no

longer stiﬁ.” (He rubs the vic-
tim's arm.) At this command the
victim’s arm drops to the former
position. -

Taking the necessary steps to de-
termine if the person is still under
hypnotic inﬂuence,- Mr. Chappell
says, “Stand up and do an about-
face. You are now in front of a pla-
toon of men. I want you to drill
these men for a few minutes.” After
the Rajah’s signal, the commands
came fast and furious, and in the
few minutes that followed the hyp-
notized victim had his imaginary
platoon all over the 12th floor, in
and.out of severai windows, and up
and down several elevator shafts.
He then brought the platoon to a
halt and turned it over to the Rajah:

At this point “Omar” decided
that the victim was under long
enough. “When I count to ﬁve you
will be awake. One-—you are slow-
ly moving. Two—you shake your
head. Th1-ee—you blink your _eyes.
Four—you slowly open your eyes.
Five—you are con_1pletely‘awake.”

The victim did not have the slight-
est idea as to what had passed in
the few minutes prior to his rude

he had done. Only did he‘- believe
them when he began to feelthe ef-
fects of the lighted cigarette.

One never knowswhen onewill d_o 7 :

By RUTH CLARKE

From Ohio University comes the
following little tale. Seems that a
discussion of court martials came
up in a history class. One student
claimed that a man had his rating
taken away when court martialed.
One freshman objected, saying that
he ought to -know for he had been
court martialed four times in the
Navy. When asked the causes of his
many trials, he replied nonchalant-
ly, “Oh, just for little things—like
once I stayed away nine days on
a week-end pass.” Little things—
how about it, you ASTS and Air
Students?

A West Virginia University co-
ed has the right idea. ’
“I think that Mrs. Hitler oughter,

Instead of a son,chad a daughter.”

Amen! -

We . . . well. What do we have
here? George Washington Univer-
sity featured a kiss machine at a
recent dance. Ten couples entered
the contest and their co-efficient of
osculatory response was measured.
A married couple ‘walked off with
the -prize. Speaks well ‘for matri-
mony. P. S.: They’ve been married
only four mpnths.

Attention freshmen! Why did you
come to college? Be honest. A lit-
tle girl at New York University con-
ﬁded: “I came to be went with, but
I aii1’t yet.” Of course that couldn’t
apply to Pitt girls. 

The faculty of Alabama Univer-
sity advises: “If at first you don’t
succeed, try summer school.”

Even the Red Cross can go only
so far. Two Gls at Southern Cal‘-'
ifornia University received the fol-
lowing note from a kind but human
worker: “We’re sorry but the holes
in these socks are rather (subtle)
large. We’re really glad to help if
we can, but next time please bring
them in before you canput them
on from either end.” No comment
needed.

Art students at the University of
Vermont are beginning to develop
inferiority complexes. .One ‘young
lady had ‘her artistic soul smashed
to a pulp when her interpretation
of no-man’s land came back with
the comment,‘ “A nice representa-
tion of soil erosion.” Ah, well, true
genius_ is never recognized until the

genius dies. ‘

Sustains Drop

In a report of the American Bag.

Pitt Law School   

Association, it is shown that the? ' 

University of Pittsburgh has held —  O

its own among prominent law;

-schools in its wartime enrollment

ﬁgures. .
There were 158 students in Pitt’!

Law School in 1939. Today therej

are 27 students, a drop of_83% 

enrollment. A number of

law,

schools have sustained even greatsgj
er cuts since 1939. Yale has had ‘I.
an 85-%_ cut in its law student“:-
group. Harvard has taken a 937d-:.
drop, and the University of Texas‘; 

a 95%_fall.
On the other hand, a few uni-;'

versities have been more fortunate} ‘T

Columbia is one of these with a’
drop of only 77%. Stanford has

dropped only 73%, and Temples,-"O

68%. Temple’s cut, however, ins’

-_cludes evening as well as” day,
classes, and there are» many eve-

ning students at the school who ‘are
deferred from selective service b.e_-.9‘
cause of daytime essential occupa.-s
tions. " O '

Bureau Conducts

Operations Clinic
Here This Week

Next Tuesday and Wednesday
Pitt’s Research Bureau for Retail
Training will conducts its semi-an-_
nual Store Operations Clinic in its
rooms on the 19th ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral of Learning. _ .

The Bureau, acting under the
co - chairmanship‘ of Professor
Bishop Brown, director of the
Bureau, and Professor Albert B.
Smith, Jr., senior fellow in man-
agement research, will receive
management executives from 27
leading department stores-in the
nation. Among the stores will be

. such prominent organizations as
Marshall Field and Co. of ~Chica- ‘

go, May Co. of Cleveland, and J.
L. Hudson Co. of Detroit.

The clinic will‘ convene Tuesday
_morning at 9:30 o’clock and will
close. Wednesday afternoon at 4
o'clock. The meetings of the officials
will _generally be in the form of in-
formal round table discussions. Such
important. topics as the selling job,
training, credit, employee relations,
and, most important, post-war plan-
ning will be discussed.

Three formaltalks will also be
Wgiven. At a luncheon on Tuesday

in the Faculty Club, Mrs. Lowen-‘
thal, assistant professor of per-
sonnel administration at the Bur-
eau, will present a talk on what

. the customer expects of stores in

the way-of service. Again at din- '
ner that same evening in Web-
ster Hall, -Mr. Earl W. 4Elhart,

' who is director of ‘the Fairchild
. Retail Publicatinos in Washing-

ton, will talk on personnel‘prob-
lems. And at luncheon in Webster
Hall on Wednesday, Mr.‘ I. D.
Wolf, vice - president of Kauf-
mann’s, will discuss “Post-war
Planning for Retailing.”

I-M League Idle,’

All was quiet on the AIM League
front this last week as the various
fraternities began their rushing ac-
tivities. Plans are underway, never-
theless, for a reorganization of the
loop, and a meeting is to be held
in the near future to decide just
what will be done. A. date for the
playoff game will also be decided on
at the meeting.

With the Phi Gams, league lead-
ers, and the Phi Delts, runner-ups,
opposed to any‘ changes which may
oust them from the play-off game,
the coming league. meeting promises
to furnish much more action than
the circuit’s activities for this last
week‘. ' _ '

BILL CIEPLY

High scorer with 111 points, Bill Cieply without a doubt was the

coming player of the season. Winding up the season with a 22 point

total, he downed the Mountaineers’ hopes for a repetition‘ of their win
streak over Pitt basketball teams. '

-—-Poet-Gazette (INS) Photo

The most highly publicized games
of the Pitt season were the Penn
State tilts. State’-s zone defense was
Doc's ruthless enemy and he meant‘
to kill it. Doc employed the freeze
in these games but it didn't mater-
ialize and we went down, 15-12. In
their return game State was again
too’ much for the Carlson men and
came through with a 35-29 win.

The Panthers met the Army men
at West Point and suffered their
most decisive setback of the season,
66 to 32. The West Pointers were
towering giants compared to the

Toughies and here height and ex-
perience meant victory.

Apple came through with aﬁeld
goal with ﬁve seconds left in the
extra session and gave the Panthers
3. 47-45 victory over Bethany.‘

We. came down the home stretch
now leaving but the two West Vir-
ginia victories, downing the Moun-
taineers 59-55 in their first meet-
ing here after a terriﬁc battle. Pitt
went to Morgantown to -take the
second decision.

Dr. Carlson could only say, “It
was the finest little team I ever
coached.”

With a little more luck than they had, our loasketballl

Panthers would have had a win percentag -

able than the one that now stands. Only :€l::l1l11fl:1ri:fSsIi)e1$:h
by NYU took the ﬁrst game of the season from the Toughies,
and the rest of the losses were accounted for by unusual play
and players. They ran all around but couldn’t jump over West.‘
rninster’s six-feet-eight goal tender and lost by a narrow mar-
gin. All along the season, unexpected happenings caused the
defeats. The only sound, undebatable licking came" at the hands
of Army at West Point——for Army has a good team and will

continue to dominate the East next season in most sports-

Oddly enough, though, Navy ,has been beaten by its fellow
service teams, probably accounted for by the professionals who
have entered nautical service.

Y Does It Happen? .

. Last week the Interfraternity Swimming Meet whipped
the otherwise calm Trees Gym pool into a lathery froth. Prin-
cipal latherers, it seems, were the members of the YMCA

swimming team. The faculty chairman of the meet, ﬁguring ‘

that the mostly independent Y boys wouldn’t have another
chance to display their swimming form, allowed them to enter
purely in the role of pacemakers. So the Y monopolized the
meet, took all the events, and then wanted to be called the win.
ner. When the Sigma Chis and the Phi Gams were oﬂicially de-
noted co-winners, the Y got angry and when the News failed

to make note of their being in the meet, an omission essential"

to the better make-up of the paper and the policy of presenting
the most important of many facts, the Y became voluble. When
the Y has a swimming team that enters a meet in which it-'

legally has a chance of winning, proper and full acknowledge-

ment will be given. Interfraternity Council stuck their co]-
lective necks out by allowing entrance of the Y, which action
lets them have something more to add to their mutterings of-
the demerits of the independents. Now where were we, oh
yes. . . . - ‘

Last Year - :

Indoor track was hitting a peak this time last year, and

V Coach (now Lieutenant) Hap Stickle was putting his charges » I
‘ through their paces within the conﬁnes of the track house.

Coach (now Lieutenant Commander) Carl Olson had departed
for the Navy sometime before, and things looked glum indeed;
Coach Stickle had a bad leg, his proteges were in various
stages of misery, and things were bitter. How different it is
this time. No track, indoor or outdoor, no track meets, no wor-
ries, and no news. ‘
Rumor Factory.

When some few papers are hard up for news, they deviate

' 3

a little from their usual sterling writing and print rumors, not -

only small article rumors but fairly large size article rumors,
complete with bold face headlines. They print, and then in-

vestigate, and even after they investigate make much ado '

about the nothing that they have discovered. Yes, again has
come the rumor that George Marshall of the Washington Red.
skins is tempting Coach Clarkshaughnessy with juicy con-

tracts if our coach deserts the college ranks and sticks with’ _

the play-for-keeps. Unless he changes his ‘former statements

very quickly, Mr‘. Shaughnessy is still with Pitt to the very‘

end, and let it not be near.
The Early Bird Catches It '

Baseball isn’t too far 0E and Coach Mitterling is going 3‘

ahead with plans to utilize under-Sta ium grounds for pre-
spring practices. According to the usual system, the inﬁelders
used the 1ndoor'space to sharpen up ﬁelding eyes and the out-

ﬁelders paced around the Stadium track to harden running .

muscles. The brainier of_ the fellows figured out a system
whereby they could stay indoors and still be an outﬁelder, so
they went for the inﬁeld until the _good weather when actual
play began, then switched to the hinterlands. As it happened,-
unfortunately, the bra1ns_fa1led to overcome the necessary,
brawn, and outﬁelding shins were bruised from peering for
and missing sharp grounders 1n the dim light of the under-

ground. All this resulted from early spring practice sessions. ’
Again Ralph Mitterling has a young team that will wonder if 9

all this is necessary, and they will ﬁnd that it is.
Will Be Having A Wonderful Time, Wish I Were Here

Much as I hate to realize it, this is only the fourth but the
last sports column I’ll have occasion to write for the News.
“sports, by hec” was one of the few things I did of the many,
things I want to do, and it was written as I Wanted to write

I it with nobody interfering with any policy expressed. The

comments were mine and no one else is to blame, and. hardly,
anyone will have a chance to blame me as I’ll leave shortly,
for the wilds of Maryland and Camp Meade. Len Tannenbaum
will begin next week as new sports editor before I get a chance
to run all the important articles and leave him with none. _ ,

"Co-Ed” Becomes
Milk Man, Licks
‘Delivery Problem

If you happen to see a pretty

_b,r_unette « bounding up the front

steps in the early morning with
your milk delivery, then you know
that your two-ton truck man has
been replaced by petite Pittite
Ruth Stewart, BA.

Ruth, 2. frosh in the School of
Business Administration, has been
helping her father with his Mones-
son dairy over the week-ends. When
other Pitt girls are starting their
second sleep on Saturday and Sun-
day mornings, this dark-eyed girl
is hustling into slacks and coat and
jumping into her dad’s milk truck,
ready to make the rounds.

Depositing bottles, collecting bot-
tles, and occasionally dropping
them —that is the dairyman’s rou-
tine. And that isn’t all of Ruth's
"talents, for she modestly states
that she can even milk cows 4-
which city gals must admit is quite
an achievement.

Ruth is one of the few girls who
does her work because she “likes
to.” .With the exception of Mrs.
Stewart ,eve_ry one in the family
has helped to deliver for the dairy.

It is doubtful whether Ruth will
ever have a milk route of her own,
so Monesson residents are making
the most of her presence while they
have her. AMonesson males who are
used to seeing her running up their
walks on summer and week-end
mornings sigh, “Isn’t the man-
power shortage grand 1”
