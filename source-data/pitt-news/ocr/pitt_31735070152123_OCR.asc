Prospective entrepeursfound startups ougl1Pitt programs

Harrison Kaminsky
Social Media Editor

Some say innovaﬁon in America is over. Alec
Davis would disagee.

The idea for Davis’ startup was born his
sophomore year at Pitt. Once, afteralong day

of classes, he returned to his apartment only '

to realize he had left the binder he needed to
do homeworkinhis classroom across campus.

“I was exhausted, and really didn’t want
to go out,” Davis said. “So I started thinking,
there had to be at least afew people who were
walking that route, anyway, and could bring
me my binder with very little effort for a few
dollars. Iwanted to create away to get in touch
with those people.”

This problem spurred Davis to develop

a smartphone app, Flippo, to “create a more .

efficient, and closer, campus community.”
“It allows busy students to post delivery
tasks that other students in the area can com-
plete for [them] in order to make a few bucks
in between classes or on their way home,”
Davis said.
Davis, who is now the CEO of a startup

based on this idea, and his team released their
app to a small group of interested testers last
weekend. The team plans to make the app
available to the public injanuary.

While Davis has waited about a year and a
halfto see his idea through, research suggests
mostyoungpeople don’tfollow throughwith
their business ideas.

According to a2011 Gallup Poll, 77 percent
of students in grades 5-12 want to be their

‘own bosses, 45 percent want to start their

own businesses and 42 perceritwant to invent
something that changes the world.

While the study showed that students
might have big plans for the future, the au-
thors noted the “focused efforts to transform
these aspirations into reality are not as strong
as they could be.” - . -

Results revealed that students lack the

‘ proper business and ﬁnance education. It also

showed younger students do not have as much
access to a business and ﬁnance education and
that few students are actually getting the prac-
tical experience required to start a business.

Board members round up progresson campaign initiatives

Danielle Fox
Stajf Wrz'ter

As the Student Government Board 2012-2013
term comes to a close,.Board members have
accomplished some of their projects, while
others have fallen to the wayside.

During each SGB campaign season, candi-
dates run on three project initiatives, which
they plan to complete if elected. Gordon
Louderback, president of the Board, said
the SGB members saw several major projects
completed duringtheir term. But projects do

not always go accordingto plan. Some Board '

members reached success by modifying their
original initiatives. Other members learned
that their projects were unfeasible or unneces-
sary, and afew said they got off to agood start,
with their projects still developing.

Gordon Louderback

SGB’s current president ran on three ini-
tiatives, including creating a campus project

submissionform,aﬁmdraisingandadvertis- ,

ing chair position and improving the alloca-
tions process.

Louderback completed all three projects
last spring.

Students could use the campus project
submission form to propose projects they
would like the Board to implement on campus.

Based on student proposals, the Board
voted on Oct. 30 to purchase a photo booth,
which student organizations can rent for
events. Louderback also said one student
submitted a proposal to establish a virtual
tour of all the residence halls, and the Resident
Student Association took up this proposal.

But Louderback added that the Board
Could not pursue every proposal. While stu-

dents submitted about 20 project proposals .

throughout the term, he said that only ﬁve
or six projects were feasible. The Board also
works under time constraints, Louderback
said.

“The Board members already have their
three projects, and they can’t always get them
done,” Louderback said. “So, adding another
project makes it difﬁcul .”

He accomplished his second initiative by

adding “relevant funding” columns to the
weekly allocations minutes. The new columns
list information concerning how much money
the Board had previously allocated to each
group. -
“It really just made the talks more efﬁcient
for the Board and easierfor the student groups
because we didn’t have to ask them as many
questions,” Louderback said. —

For Louderback’s third initiative, he pro-
posed the replacement of the Public Relations
Committee with a Ftmdraising and Advertis-
ing Committee. Afterthe Board approved the
switch, Louderback selected Erin Worbs, a
senior majoringinpolitical science, philoso-
phy and communication, as the Fundraising
and Advertising Committee’s chairwoman.

“The Board wanted to create a committee

_ thatcould_bearesourceforstudentorganiza-

tions to go to get advice for fundraising and
advertisingas well as have a chairperson to
fundraise for SGB events,” Louderback said.

Amelia Brause

Brause promised during her campaign to
try to extend the Healthy U program and to
help students ﬁindraise on campus. Brause
said she will complete these two projects
early in the 2014 spring semester, but in a

slightly different manner thanlshe originally '

proposed. _

Brause said Healthy U will host a ﬁnan-
cial seminar on how to save money for the
new year and a yoga event in January. The
Healthy U program identiﬁes eight areas of
wellness: physical, emotional, intellectual,
social, occupational, environmental, spiritual

and ﬁnancial. V

Brause’s program will highlight a differ-
ent aspect of wellness every month of the
academic year. Brause organized a monthly
competition through which student organi-
zations can win prizes by attending Healthy
U events. ,

Brause said she worked with Healthy U to
release the program in the 2013 fall semester,
but scheduling conflicts delayed the program.

“We ﬁnally got approval, and it’s been dif-
ﬁcult. There were a lot of things going on,
and it just didn’t happen with scheduling,”
Brause said.

Brause’s program required her to coordi-
nate activities with Student Health Services,
the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs, individual ﬁtness
instructors and intramural sports staff. Be-
cause so many different parties were involved,
she could not ﬁgure out a schedule for the
program that worked for all of them.

Brause planned to host a ﬁindraising
week this fall as part of her second initiative.
She said she moved the week to the spring

December 9, 2018 i The Pitt News I vv\ANv.pitinewsl.c0m

to coincide with a ﬁlndraising concert that
Sarah Klein, an incoming Board member,
has plarmed. The Board will direct the col-
lected donations to Greek Life’s $300,000
three—year fundraising pledge to the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation.

Brause said her third initiative to allow
student organizations to advertise through
a portal with the Student Organization Re-
source Center-turned out to be unrealistic.

Brause said she realized after talking to
administration and CSSD that she would not
be able to complete the portal during her
term. She" said her proposed project, which
would have included an interactive calendar
and a board for advertisements, would have
required too much web design workfor her to
ﬁnish within one year. In place of this initia-
tive, Brause said she worked with Mike Nites
on a book that details how to be a successful
organization on campus. The book includes
information such as how to reserve a table in
Towers lobby and how to place an advertise-
ment on the visual display boards.

Brause said the center will offer the book
for free to all studentorganizations next se-
mester. She said she expects copies to be avail-
able through the Student Organization Re-

source Center in the middle of next semester.
John Cordier j
Cordier promised to implement a program
to improve off-campus living, to extend the

' range of Wi-Fi farther outdoors and to in-
crease the number of visual display boards I

in campus buildings. .

Cordier said he originally planned to’

improve off-campus living through com-
munity service events and “good neighbor
activities,” but insteadhelped Board member
Dave Rosenthal with his off-campus seminars
and a guide to living off campus for students.

“When Dave’s idea came up, itwas in total

alignment with my goal for that project,” he i

said. “I felt that it would be best to team up
[to improve off-campus living.]”
For his second project, Cordier met with

‘ CSSD, and he was told that it was only a mat-

ter of placing more routers within Hillman
Library. .

CSSD installed more routers, so students
can study in more locations, such as Schenley
Plaza. "

Cordier also planned to increase the
number of visual display boards in campus
buildings. He wrote a recommendation to
academic departments, including chemistry,

“We discovered there wasn’ta serious need
to extend hours based [on] use,” Bonge said.
SafeRider currently operates from 7 p.m.
to 3 am. from Sundayto Wednesday and stops

running at 5 a.m. from Thursday to Saturday. .

Bonge has not completed histhird project,
but said he met with Armabelle Clippinger, the
director of Pitt Arts, and reached out to arts-
related organizations to encourage members
to take advantage of Pitt Arts.

Thomasjabro

Jabro worked to improve meal plans and
communication with Sodexo and provided
free lunch for some students in the process
in order to persuade the University to pub-
lish Student Opinion of Teaching, or OMET,
surveys and to increase funding for student
organizations. “ ’ '

Jabro and Board member M_ike Nites uti-

lized-apre-existingFoodCommittee,through ‘

which suidentsfcould meet with Sodexo repre-
sentatives and voice their ideas or comments

‘ aboutthe service -while eating complimentary

food from Sodexo. .. i

To encouragefclisctission about on-campus
dining options, Jabro said he added student
representatives groups such as the Mus-
lim Student Association, the Resident Student
Association, the I-_,Iillel]ewish University Cen-
ter, Plant to Plate and Gluten Free My Campus
to the Food Committee.

_ For his second project, Jabro tried to per-
suade the University to publish the results of
the Student Opinion of Teaching surveys, but
has been unsuccessful so far.

Jabro proposed the idea to University Sen-
ate Committee on Educational Policy, which
voted to leave thelclecisiori to Pitt’s_ individual
academic schools} V '  . A I if

Kathleen Kel y,’president of the Senate
Committee, saidithe committee members
were concemedbtécause professors are/not
required to request a survey. She added that
the results “capture a student’s impression of a
professor,” such as the professor’s personality
or information not relevant to the course, but
not his or her teaching methods. p

Jabro workediwith Nuwan Perera, Aca-
demic Affairs Committee chair, to determine
student support of the initiative by distributing
a petition and developing a survey that the
Academics Affairs Committee will release in
the spring.

Jabro and Perera have discussed their
proposal with various deans. Perera said the
Academics Affairs Committee plans to present
an ofﬁcial proposal to the Dietrich School of
Arts and Sciences next year.

]abro’s third campaign initiative was -to
increase ﬁinding to service organizations.
He said he does not know the exact numbers,’
but is conﬁdent that funding has increased.

The Board frequently voted this year to
ﬁmd service requests, such as federal and state
background checks, clearances and criminal
history records that are necessary to work
with children. Jabro said previous Board
‘members had misinterpreted the allocations
manual, which did ‘not prohibit approval of
the requests, but Board members commonly
denied them during previous terms.

Michael Nites

Nites campaigned to move the SGB alloca-
tions process online, to establish an “academic
grace period” to give students a few days off
beforeﬁnal exams and to improve transporta-
tion options. . ' ” ,

‘Nites has used Jotform, a site that hosts
online forms, to devise a process to submit
allocations requests online. He said it will

,‘ decrease confusion, keep a better history of
requests and reduce the amount of paper SGB

uses.

“The idea is that the online process will
walk students through the request,”.Nites
said. “It will have more instruction that can
change dynamically on the different options
you choose. So, if you click that you are going
to a competition, itwill put in speciﬁci_nstruc-
tion for the justiﬁcation.”

Nites said the Board will store future re-
quests inthe system, and the Allocations Com-
mittee and student organizations will be able
to access them more easily.

“If we wanted to ﬁgure how muchlmoney
club sports get, we could easily have a record
of the past ﬁve years of da ”.Nites said.

Nites said Jotform will give SGB 100 free
submissions a month. SGB would pay $9.95
for every additional 1,000 submissions. Nites
said he plans to debut the platform at the ﬁrst
allocations meeting next semester.

Nites’ third initiative was to implement an
academic grace period, which would eliminate
classes on the Thursday and Friday before
ﬁnals. Nites said there were mixed feelings
among students about whether or not they
wanted the grace period, so he stopped work

ENTREPRENEURS

Of the students who responded to the poll,
95 percent said that they are not currently
interning with a local business, 76 percent of
students in grades 9-12 responded that they
worked less than one hour in a paying job in
the week prior to taking the survey and 50
percent of students in grades 5-12 said that
their schools do not offer classes in how to
start and run a business.

Last year, Davis submitted his plan for
Flippo to the Randall Family Big Idea Competi-
tion, a yearly contest held at Pitt that awards
money to would—be entrepreneurs. Although
the team, which initially included Branden
Karnell and Chirag Shah, left empty—handed,
they still felt that their idea could take off after
continuing to develop the project.‘

Nor did the team’s loss discourage another
student who saw the team at the competition.

Brandon Chu, a ﬁnance student at Pitt’s
College of Business Administration, initially
had plans to present a water-repellant dental
mirror at last year’s Big Idea Competition.
After this plan fell through, Chu decided to
volunteer at the competition instead.

When Chu saw the Flippo team present its
vision, he felt compelled to join the team. He
is now its vice president of sales.

‘‘Our job is to make the app something
you’d want to tell your friends about,” Chu
said. “There are students that have time and

5 no money, and there are students who have

money and no time. We want to develop a
platform to bring those people together.”

v The team hopes the app will receive alarge
following early on after it becomes available
to the public on both iOS and Android devices
next month. Chu said that this way, the team

willbe able to harness support for the business. I

Chu said the team members plan to tap
into the nearly 500 active users on Flippo’s
Facebook page, which it has maintained since

'~ October 2012.

“We’ll ﬁnd the active people on there, hand
the app out to them, integrate it into campus
life and get it going. We have to hit a critical
mass,” Chu said. “But ﬁrst, we have to ﬁnish
development and then we can focus on incor-
porating [the concept .”

Davis and his team aren’t the only aspiring
entrepreneurs at Pitt.

Each year, the Randall Family Big Idea
Competition has hosted about 30 to 60 teams
of hopeful entrepreneurs who compete for

the ultimate prize: the funds and resources
to kick—start their own business and get their
hopes and dreams off the ground.

The 2014 event will be held by Pitt’s new
Innovation Institute, which brings the previ-
ously existing Office of Technology Manage-
ment, Ofﬁce of Enterprise Development and
the Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence
under one roof. ,

Last year; 1_3itt’s David Berg Centerfor Ethics
and Leadership hosted the competition. The
eventwas previously hosted by Pitt’s Institute
for Entrepreneurial Excellence from 2009

through 2012.

The event, which takes place each spring,
handed out a total of $85,000 to the top ﬁve
teams that participated in last year’s competi-
tion.- This year, teams will have a shot at one
of four grand prizes, each worth $20,000. A
winning team from an additional ‘W/vildcard”
category will receive $5,000.

As the old adage “if at ﬁrst you don’t succeed,” A

goes, the Flippo team will try again at this
year’s Big Idea Competition.

“We don’t see why not,” Chu said. “One of
the major obstacles we had last year was that

Flippo was still a concept. We have done a lot
since then. We have done market validation,
we have an active Facebook group, we have a
committed team, and most importantly we
will have a product before the competition.
Flippo will be much more concrete in the next
competition, and we’re excited to try again.”

The rules of the competition allow teams
to enter more than once.

Teams also must include at least one stu-
dent enrolled in classes at Pitt. Davis’ team ﬁts

on the project. The academic grace period
would have extended the semester and pre-
vented professors from having ﬁnals the few
days before ﬁnals week. I

Instead, Nites has been working with Lau-
ren Barney, a junior who ran in the 2012 and
the 2013 SGB elections, to eliminate Introduc-
tion to Chemistry and Introduction to Biology
exams on Monday, as well as the 4 to 6 p.m.
Saturday ﬁnal.

Nites said he and Barney. will meet with
Kathy Humphrey, Vice Provost and Dean of
Students, and Juan Manfredi, Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Studies, to present their

’ research on other universities that have suc-

céssfully eliminated these ﬁnal exam time
slots over break or at the beginning of the
next semester.

Nites worked with Kevin Sheehy, director

Nites also implemented a new budget
policy that allows Student Affairs_Afﬁliated
Groups to submit budgets semesterly instead
of armually. These groups include the Resident
Student Association, Interfraternity Council,
National Panhellenic Conference, Panhellenic
Association, Black Action Society, Asian Stu-
dent Alliance, Engineering Student Cabinet
and Nursing Student Association. “

Nites said the policy will decrease prob-

Dave Rosenthal

While Rosenthal succeeded in his plans to
teach students to cook healthy meals and to
give students avoice against unfair practices
by Oakland landlords, he missed the bus to
provide student transportation to the airport
during the holidays.

Rosenthal said that the University’s con-
tract for free bussing with Port Authority
states that the University cannot replicate
any bus route already in place.

“Thiswas one ofthe projects thatlthought
was going to be easy to accomplish,” Rosen-
thal said in an email. “I was horribly wrong.”

Rosenthal worked with the Student Di-
etetic Association and the HealthyU program

to host three healthy cooking classes for the
“average student.” '

Ros_enthal said ﬁmdraising and advertis-
ing were two major issues with the cooking
classes. Since SGB does not ﬁund for food,
Rosenthal used'anOutside the Classroom Cur-
riculummini grantaswellas Student Dietetic
Association funds.

Rosenthal said a solution to fundraising
and advertising issues could be to approach
organizations — sports teams, fraternities
and sororities — to determine whether
members would attend the courses as a team-
building, brotherhood or sisterhood event.

Rosenthal hosted two off-campus living
seminars this semester and invited lawyers
and housing experts to speak with students
about how to deal with a bad landlord.

Rosentl1al saidboth events were successful

Sowmya Sanapala

Sanapala campaigned to increase cultural
awareness on campus and to decrease unsafe
sex among students through increased con-
dom availability in residence halls. ‘She also
plarmedito persuade the University to affiliate
with the Workers Rights Consortium, an orga-
nization that monitors conditions at factories

  

that produce university apparel.

Sanapala belongs to Americans for In-
formed Democracy, a student organization
that spearheaded efforts to persuade-the
University to align with the Workers Rights
Consortium.

Sanapala said she spent the spring semes-
ter working with Americans for Informed
Democracy and found out this fall that the
University joined the Workers _Rights Consor-
tium. She said the project was a “collaborative
effort” between SGB, Americans for Informed
Democracy and administration.

“We endedﬁoff on kind of a shaky note
last semester, and we didn’t know what we
would have to do this semester on our end to
convince the University.” Sanapala said. “But
when we sat down with [administration], they
actually had good news for us.”

Sanapala worked to improve sexual health

Meanwhile, one of the winning teams from
lastyeafs Bigldea Competition plans to launch
its program this month. ’

Called Fliplynk, the program lets any orga-
nization that raises funds online accept used
electronics, such as smartphones, laptops,
iPods and tablets, as an additional source of
funding. _

The devices are sent to Fliplynk’s back-
end liquidation partners, which are certiﬁed
repurposing and recycling ﬁrms that ﬁxf and
clearalldatafrom the devices. Then, the ﬁrms
resell the devices to retailers and wholesalers,
generating cash for the donators’ causes.

Fliplynks founder, Vishal Vinayak, gradu-
ated from Pitt’s Katz Graduate School of Busi-
ness last spring.

“With incentives, including donating to a
‘good cause, recycling electronics and ﬁnancial
viability, Fliplynk is a new and excitingway to
ﬁmdraise,” Vinayak said.

Fliplynk will have its application pro gram-
ming interface, orAPI, available on its website.

An API “allows two pieces of software to
easily communicate,” Vinayak said. “‘Our API
works with all our partners’ systems to help
them offer our services on their websites vvith—
out any hassle.”

Vinayak’s team, made up of now— graduated
Katz students Kartikjohari and Andrew Dev-
lin, along with James Marasti, a graduate of
Robert Morris University, and Michael Han-
kowsky, a senior at Carnegie Mellon University,
wanted to start a company that has a positive
global impact.

“Fundraising is one of the hardest en-
deavors for any individual or organization,
and Fliplynk seeks to empower anyone with
asimple, easy method of fundraisingfortheir
cause,” Vinayak said.

While the Flippo team was able to survive
without the funding provided by the Big Idea
Competition, Vinayak said that Fliplynk win-
ning $20,000 at last year’s contest is the only
reason he kept going with the idea.

“The funds provided to us allowed us to
bootstrap the projectforsix months,” Vinayak
said.

Chu said that although Flippo didn’t win
anyﬁmdingatlastyear’s Bigldeacompetition,
the team wasn’tdiscouraged because it was
able to receive help from PantherLabWorks.

Chu said that although Flippo didn’t win
any funding at the Big Idea Competition last
year, the team wasn’t discouraged because
it was able to receive help from Pantl1erLab-
Works. '

PantherLabWorks, Pitt’s own startup
incubator, “accelerates highly creative and
motivated innovators through the process
of product development, market validation
and team creation,” according to its website.

Chu, who is also a consultant at Pitt’s In-
stitute for Entrepreneurial Excellence and has
been involved inanumber of entrepreneurial
ventures throughout his college years, had ad-
vicefor others look-ingto gettheir own startups
off the ground.

“Pinpoint the very core features of the

project you’re trying to put out. Find speciﬁ— ‘

cally the problems you’re ttyingto solve,” Chu
said. ‘And from the beginning, ﬁnd the feature
you’re looking to introduce to the market.”

Chu also said that it’s important not to work
on extra features until the foundation of one’s
project is completed.

“Focus on what needs to be done, make
the core product, alpha test it, test again and
again, and then ﬁnally release it to the market

whenyou have the results you’ve been looking v

for;” Chu said.

Chu drewan analogy to illustrate his point.

“It’s like trying to build a model airplane.
You can spend three months on it all to ﬁnd
out that it doesn’t even ﬂy. You have to build
the skeletal structure, and see if it flies ﬁrst,”
Chu said. “Keep adding features, but also keep
making sure that it still flies. Make sure you’re
minimalistic and stay on track with itbefore it
gets out of hand and is unrealistic.

PantherLabWorks offers students and
others at Pitt resources such as mentors and
networking opportunities.

Davis said people shouldn’t hide good
ideas. - —

“I’ve had a lot of people approach me with
startup ideas, telling me to make sure to keep
them secret. My main advice to these aspiring
entrepreneurs is not to worry —— tell everyone '
about it,” Davis said.

Chu felt similarly, ackowledging that having a
good idea is “literally just one step of the way.”
“If someone were to take your idea, and
take every single'step necessary to complete
the goal, then goodfor them for getting there
ﬁrst,” Chu said. “But it’s very unlikely that
someone actually will take every single nec-
essary step.”
Vinayak had some of his own advice to
offer. ‘

He said that, when forming a team, the
most important thing is implicit trust.

“We can work together the whole day in
silence, while still knowing what each of us
can and will do by the end of the day,” he said.

And most startups don’t just have an idea

and run with it immediately. Would—be en-
trepreneurs have to do a lot of preliminary
research before getting the product off the
ground.

“We always tend to look at things from a
psychological perspective. Why would a user
use our product? Is it easy enough for him to
use it? Is some part of it too ugly?” Vinayak
said. “Why would they even consider sharing
this on their wall? What do our partners want,
and what’s important for them to get across?

Davis said that an idea alone isn’t enough
to launch a company.

“The execution is the hard part, and it is
the passion for the idea that is going to help
you make it a reality,” Davis said. “Nobody
strikes gold right away, so go out there and
talk to anyone who is willing to listen. Get
their feedback, and take it seriously.” I

halls, but worked with LGBT Outreach Initia-
tive to develop a Student Health form through
which organizations can request a certain
amount of prophylactics to distribute at edu-
cational programs. ‘ ..
Sanapala had initially campaigned to pro-
mote multicultural diversity by bringing back
SGB’s Multicultural Committee, but changed
her plans after she talked to student cultural
organizations about their needs.

“[The organizations] didn’t feel like it was

necessary anymore,” she said. “They already
felt comfortable coming to the SGB office or a
representative to speak about any issue they
might have.” ‘

Sanapala said she instead began working
with the Multicultural Association to organize
events for the club and to help with allocations.

“The committee was an effort that I re-
alized was not necessary, and I didn’t want
to create another student group,” she said.
“Instead, I threw my weight behind an emerg-
ing one.”

Sarah Winston

Winston pledged to implement an online
reservations system for Student Health Ser-
vices, to establish a textbook swap program
and to make the Green Fund Advisory Board
permanent within Student Affairs.

Winston said she envisioned a process
for making appointments that would be very

similarto aservice UPMC offers on its website.

“Every time you sign into make anaccount,

the nurse and whoever will see your whole
medical ﬁle will pop up,” Winston said. _
‘ Although Winston said that Student Health
Services reported to her that it planned to
make a system for students to make medi-
cal appointments online through its website
during the 2013 spring semester, there was
no such service on its website as of press time.
Winston and Perera met last semester

with Debra Fyock, manager of the University _

Store, to discuss establishing a textbook swap
through the University. T

“In working with‘Debra Fyock, it’s obvious
that the University Store does everything it
can to ensure that prices are low,” Winston
said “That being said, I wanted to do more.”

While the University did not establish a
textbook swap, Winston introduced a reso-
lution to support Textbook Friend, an online
platform where students can buy and sel1.text—
books to other students on their campus. The
resolution passed, and there are currently
about 30 textbooks posted on Pitt’s platform.

Winston’s ﬁnal initiative was to establish
an Ofﬁce of Sustainability for environmental
groups on campus. Wi_r1ston worked with the
Green Fund Advisory Board, asubcommittee
ofthe Environmental Committee that allocates
funding to student environmental groups,
including Green Fund Advocates, to introduce
a resolution advocating for the creation of an
oﬂice within the Oﬁice of StudentAﬁ'airs. The
resolution passed in early October.

Winston said she and members of the
Green Fund Advisory Board and the Board
met with administration and are continuing
to work on this project. I

Curricular abandonment of Worldwide genocides

catastrophic to student development

Simon Brown
Columnist

At the end of every November, Americans
. gather to celebrate a moment from their
national memory: a communal feast that
united Native Americans and European
settlers during the earliest days ofcoloniza-
tion. Although this event does not appear

in history text books and the occurrence '

of a similar event is debatable, it does not
hinder the celebration that takes place.

Earlier this November, Germans and ,

Austrians also gathered to remember a very
real episode in their history, the 75th an-
niversary of “Kristallnacht,” or the “Night
of Broken Glass,” during whichjews were
' subjected tostreet violence, and tens of
thousands were corralled into concentra-

tion camps. I . .
This dark moment in human history,
however, will go unremembered by mil-

- lions of young Americans due to an un.—

acceptable poverty in our public-school
history curricula’.

For Pennsylvania schools, this systemic
problem has come into focus on one his-
torical subject, the Holocaust — during
which fascist European nations repressed
and systematically exterminated1_1 mil-
lionjews, Roma, homosexuals, political

dissidents and countless other rninorities”

between 1933 and 1945. 7 ,. 9 - , ,  

A bill currently under consideration
before the Pennsylvania Senate aims to
symbolically “allow” public schools in

Pennsylvania to “offer instruction in the

Holocaust, other forms of genocide and
human—rights violations.” This gesture

would only ofﬁcially recommend that.

schools educate students on these subjects,
after an amendment that would mandate
the subject was narrowly defeated before
the House.

That ignorance is not unique to the
most catastrophic humanitarian crisis in
world history. Rather, it is an indication
of the curricular abandonment of history
and social studies in general by education

, administrators and policy makers. The Na-

tional Assessment of Educational Progress
reported in 2010 that only 12 percent of
students scored‘ “proﬁcient” in U.S. his-
tory. Perhaps more indicative is the total
absence of world history from that federal

GREAT

assessment program.

When under—resourced schools face the
ﬁnancial chopping block based exclusively
on their students’ scores in reading and
math, it’s little wonder that administra-
tors make less and less time for the now
“extra—curricular” social studies.

But even for Pennsylvania students,
such as myself, who did beneﬁt from tal-
ented teachers and a close attention to the
Holocaust, the subject remains painfully
mistaught. To illustrate the superﬁciality
of our standard treatment of the event,

‘ I will recount my own education on the

subject. The treatment of the events usually
conformed to this recognizable narrative:

Keep the ‘work hard, play hard’ mentality out of finals

Sophia ‘A1 Rasheed
Columrzzsl

As ﬁnals week approaches, I can’t help but
carry an almost condescending senior at-
titude toward the noobs who allow stress
to take over. This could partially be due
to round two of senioritis, but I’d like to
think that it has more to do with the re-
ﬁned approach I’ve learned to take toward
ﬁnals week.

Over the past seven semesters, I’ve
made more of an effort to avoid stress in
preparation for studying time rather than
actually increasing the amount of time I
study, because I’ve found that eliminating
stress will actually help me stay focused

and positive. The result has saved me sev-
eral panic attacks and provided me with
the feeling that I can attack the week, and
I’d like to pass the savings on to you.

The overall theme of these tips is to
avoid the mentality that normally plagues

the way present—day college students ap- A

proach their lives: the “work hard, play
hard” mentality. While Wiz Khalifa is sort
of proof that this motto can get us far in
life, I’ve found that students wrongly adopt
this into their approach to the college life-
style. It seems that many would like to
spend their time completely entrenched
in “play,” instead of focusing on school.
Don’t get me wrong, playing is deﬁnite-
ly necessary to our sanity, but too much

of it gets in the way of the “work” aspect

-and negatively impacts your overall work

output by increasing stress and reducing
the efficiency with which you complete
work during ﬁnals week.

Now I’m not going to assume that “play” I

always involves alcohol, but in case it does,
you might want to consider switching to a
different form of stress relief during ﬁnals

.week, as this can have the most counteract—~

ing effect on stress. In the health article
“Drinking alcohol may prolong, not re-
lieve, stress” published in U.S. Newsand

‘ World Report, associate researcher Emma

Childs from the University of Chicago dis-
cussed the effects of alcohol consumption
on stress levels.

“The increase in heart rate and blood
pressure, the release of cortisol [a stress
hormone] and also the increased feelings
of tension and negative mood each_ reach
a climax and dissipate at a different rate.
Therefore, drinking more alcohol might
have different effects, depending on how
long after the stress a person»drin_ks,” she
said.

In addition to actually increasing the
likelihood of a stress takeover, drinking
stands in the way of a quality night’s sleep.
Multiple sources, such as Maia Szalavitz’s
article in Time “Sleeping it off: How al-
cohol affects sleep quality,” make it clear

BROWN .

“In 1933, Adolf Hitler became the leader
of Germany by his very persuasive speak-
ing. He detested Jews, and he convinced

. the Germans to strip Jews of their rights

and send them to concentration camps. By
1945, 11 million people, including 6 million
Jews, had been massacred.”

This account_provides none of the con-
text that could express the present—day ur-
gency of the message. The narrative focuses
on individuals and particulars, rather than
societies and mentalities, thereby empha-
sizing the genocide’s historical distance
and “uniqueness.” This retelling denies
students not only of a rich understanding
of the material, but also of an opportunity
to ponder the lingering echoes of the Holo-
caust in the realities of present-day racism,
intolerance and scapegoating.

Rather, if educators could focus on the
systemic social conditions that permitted
the genocide, they could draw connections
to the world in which their students live. If
they would teach that anti-Semitism had
pervaded Europe for over a millennium and
had produced massacres and resettlements
long before ‘the Holocaust, then it would
force students to consider the prejudices
that have plagued U.S. history since its
inception.

If they could teach that the Nazis mas-
sacred a whole range of minorities, and
not only thejewish population upon which
curricula usually focuses, they would en-
able discussion of the continuing, state-
sponsored oppression of minority groups
in the present day -— whether it manifests
in France’s expulsion of Romani people in
2010 or in Russia’s ever—increasing laws

 

discriminating against the country’s LG-
BTQ community.

Finally, if they could teach that not all
Germans activelyparticipated in the Ho-
locaust and some resisted it, then they
could bring students to question their
own obligations toward minorities and
the oppressed. Do we, as citizens, have
obligations to actively resist an unjust gov-
ernment? Does that obligation span across
borders‘? These are the pressing questions
that not only can educatestudents, but can
also engage them.

Such a rich curriculum could be avail-
able for any student, but it would take
considerable time to teach, and it would
spark critical thinking and reﬂection from
its students. Neither of these components,
however, ﬁt into the prevailing educational
regimen administered through Harrisburg,
Pa.

The state government cannot cut fund-
ing, enforce standards that value only math
and language arts and then mandate that
schools teach select events to mask stu-
dents’ embarrassing under-education in

history. It will require the state to mandate
more historical education across the board
and provide the money for a rich, engaging
curriculum.

These curricula can give students the
critical tools to better understand the
causes and effects of genocide — some-
thing this country collectively needs. And
if you’d like proof that history curricula
needs changed, remember what holiday
we celebrate on the last Thursday of every
November. 5

Picking the right beer to make

If I’ve learned anything during my
tenure in college, it’s that everything
is better when accompanied by a beer.
This time of year, everything is made
up, largely, of studying.

Now, it’s undeniable that a glass of
beer on the desk makes the studying
process inﬁnitely more bearable, but
caution is required. No one wants to
be in the midst of a paper or flurry of
ﬂashcards only to realize that the alco-
hol has taken effect, rendering studying
impossible. Fortunately for everyone,

be had that will improve ﬁnals week

the sound of a gong springs to mind. Yet
meditation is something that we humble
college students can practice, as well.
The ﬁrst thing to note is the differ-
encein terms: mindfulness meditation
is different than religious meditation.
As religious studies professor Clark

practice and doesn’t attempt to reach
a religious goal or to achieve some

forward balance, as the aforementioned
Sam Adams, with a soothing citrus
note to ﬁnish it off. Routinely men-
tioned among the best beers produced
in America, it is a failsafe choice for a
casual study beer.

If you’re in the mood for something
hoppy, look to Founders’ All Day IPA.
Appropriately named for its 4.7 percent
ABV, it is a beer that can be consumed
en masse without too much of an ad-
verse effect. It is aggressively hoppy
with ﬂavors of citrus and pine, able to
satisfy hop —heads everywhere while still
being forgiving enough to study with.

Finals are terrible, but the post-
ﬁnals elation makes it all worthwhile.‘
As is done in most parts of the world,
celebrations are usually accompanied
by drink — the best of which, of course,
is beer. Seeing as personal responsibil-
ity is at a distinct low as ﬁnals end, con-
suming sorne harsher, higher—ABV beers
is not only merited, but encouraged.

With Christmas close on the horizon,
an excellent choice for a burly beer is
Troegs’ Mad Elf, theirwinter seasonal.
Flavored with honey and cherries and
ﬂexing its muscles at 11 percent ABV,
Mad Elf is a wonderful and surprisingly
easygoing beer that _needs.to be treated
with a bit of caution. Its sweetness hides

the alcohol well, but be assured, it’s
there. Don’t let Mad Elf sneak up on you
— or do, if you want. That’s fine, too. A

If Belgian ales are more your style,
try Delirium Tremens from the Huyghe
Brewery in East Flanders, Belgium.
Delirium can be expensive but is well

A worth the price. It tastes of aromatic

peppercorns and sweet fruit with a

lboozy ﬁnish that reveals its 8.2 per-

cent ABV punch. It is one of the most

celebrated Belgian brews around, as ‘

well as a personal favorite, for a reason.
Finally, if you’re a bit more adven-

I turous and want to try something truly

crazy, go for Dogﬁsh Head’s 120 Minute
IPA. Its rotating limited-release season
makes it difficult to ﬁnd, but should
you be able to get your hands on the 18
percent ABV ale, you’ll be in for a truly
rewarding experience. It’s abusive, to
be sure, but not as much as you might
expect. Some of the sugars that help
the beerachieve such a high level of
alcohol content during the fermentation
process get left behind in the bottle,

adding a level of sweetness that cuts

120 Minute’s massive bite. It’s a punch
in the face, but a good one that will have
you coming back for more.

, Enjoy these: beers with the respon-
sibility and understanding that every

level of beer has its place in the world ‘

and, an appropriate setting for con-
sumption. Good luck, everyone. I

_“Stress” has come to be the catch-
word describing the end of the semes-
ter. “Stress is caused by fear, the fear of
not doing well,” Chilson said. “This is
imagined fear (that is, no one is being
attacked, there is nophysical suffering),
and fear induces stress.vWhen this hap-
pens, people lose perspective on what
is happening and focus on what could
happen.” ' I

So what exactly is mindfulness
meditation and how can it help relieve
stress? '

According to Deanna Burkett, out— -

reach and consultation coordinator at
the University of Pittsburgh Counsel-

ing Center, “Mindfulness meditation
involves a certain quality of attention.
In mindfulness meditation, attention
isldirected to the present moment in a
non-judgmental way.” Burkett explained
that this attention to thepresent mo‘-
ment is meant to “break the momentum
created by futu're—oriented and past-
oriented thinking, which usually carries
with itva lot of planning,‘ anxiety, and
worrying.” V ‘

Mindfulness uses the present mo-
ment as the object of meditation. Often,
the participant is encouraged to count
their breaths, feel their physicality in

. whatever position they are sitting and

to non-judgmentally observe thoughts
as they may flit into the mind. It is in.

moment that “the mind experiences
some rest from the worries and anxi-
eties it often experiences as it plans,
evaluates, anticipates and analyzes,”
Burkett said.

The beneﬁts of mindfulness medi-
tation have been found to improve the

"physical condition of the participant

and to visibly reduce the signs of stress-.
Physical indicators of stress (such as
blood pressure, depression,gpresence
of stress hormones) are reduced signifi-
cantly in people who practice mindful-
ness meditation. According to Burkett,
“Cultivating a regular mindfulness prac—
tice can produce beneﬁts that reach into
all realms of experience: individual,
relational and academic.”

The othergood news is that mindful-
ness meditation does not have to take

a huge chunk of your day. According to —

Buddhist monk Bhante Soorakkulame
Pemaratana, allocating 10 minutes of
your day to meditation or mindfulness
will bring a change in your life. In re-
sponse to the common co11ege—student
concern for “wasting time,” Pemaratana
pointed out that it’s actually an efficient
use of time. _ g
“Spending 10 minutes meditating
will give you more time, actually,”
Pemeratana said in an email. “When

_ we don’t have that peace, awareness

and centeredness, we can be very easily
distracted to things that consume our
time (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). We actu-
ally save a lot of time when~meditating
and are able to manage our time,better
afterwards.”

In essence, practicing mindfulness
can not only physically reduce your

8 stress levels, but also save you time in

the long run. Mindfulness is something
that can be practiced by anyone_at any
time. There are many resources in and
around Pittsburgh that can help foster
meditation and get you started on add-
ing meditation practices to your life.
Here at Pitt, the Stress Free Zone offers
classes on meditation dnce a week, as
well as mindful yoga every day. There is
also a Shambhala Meditation Center on
North Highland Avenue in East Liberty,
and for those with cars, the Zen Center
of Pittsburgh is located just outside the
city in Sewickley.

But you don’t have to travel or even
walk out of your dorm room to practice
mindfulness meditation.

Mindfulness can also be-practiced by
simply noticingeach breath, concen-
trating on the present moment and non-
judgmentally observing your thoughts,
fears and concerns as they may enter
your consciousness. ,

As Buddhist monk and activist Thich
Nhat Hanh once said, “The present mo-

ment is filled withjoy and happiness. If .

you are attentive, you will see it.” I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt’s defensive strategy

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

The Panthers’ No. 207 spot in national

strength of schedule proves that the Pitt
men’s' basketball team has yet to face
dominant teams this season.

However, it has cruised to a 9-0 re-
cord despite encountering talented point
guards, many of whom have taken advan-
tage of the NCAA’s new foul rules.

The rules, implemented by NCAA of-
ﬁcials this past offseason, were enacted
to cut down on hand—checking "and to
solidify block and charge calls near the
basket.

Using an offensive style that plays into
the hands of the new rules, Penn State
point guard Tim Frazier proved last Tues-
day night that he is single—handedly capa-

ble of shredding a defense in Pitt’s 78-69
victory. On most possessions, the 6-foot-
1, 170—pound speedster dribbled around
the perimeter, feeding off his teammates’
screens until he found an opening in the
defense that he could penetrate.

Loyola Marymount touted the same
threat in 5—foot-10 Anthony Ireland on
Friday, who scored 20 of the Nittany Li-
ons’ 68 points, with-six free throws. The
shifty ﬂoor general and his Lions were not
able to top the Panthers, who scored 85.

“The game is called different,” Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon said. “It’s an ad-
vantage to the guy that can put it on the
ﬂoor and put his head down, and that’s
what Frazier does, and I think this is the
same thing that Ireland does as well.”

Teams scored an average of just 67.5
points per game last season, the lowest

attempts per game, up from its 20.2 av-
erage last season, and although confer-
ence play hasn’t begun, the Panthers have
scored 82 points per game compared to
last year’s 69.

“Free throws are up for obvious rea-
sons, and you’ve got to keep guys in front
without fouling them,” Dixon said. “It’s
not a one-man job, it’s a team job. You’ve
got to use ﬁve guys, and you’ve got to get

said of speedy point guards. “So it’s not
solely one guy guarding them. Oftentimes
it’s transition. One-on—one with the whole
side of the ﬂoor to go, anybody can go by

anybody, so you don’t want to get in those

situations.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt finishes non-conference schedule over break

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Through nine games, Pitt men’s basket-
ball has defeated its opponents by an
average of about 21 points. Penn State
was the only team to come within single
digits ofthe Panthers when Pitt beat its
nearby rival 78-69 Dec. 2.

The Panthers look to continue their
winning streak over the University’s
winter break, with five games on the
schedule. Highlights include a trip to
Madison Square Garden to play former
Big East rival University of Cincinnati
as part of the Jimmy V Classic on Dec.
17 and the Panthers’ first Atlantic Coast
Conference game on the road against
North Carolina State.

The play of Pitt’s seniors, forward
Lamar Patterson and center Talib
Zanna, has guided the Panthers in the
season’s early installments. Patterson
leads the Panthers with averages of 16.2

points and 5.2 assists per game, while
Zanna is posting 13 points and a team-
high seven rebounds per game.

Here’s a look at theteam’s five games
scheduled over break:

Pitt vs. Youngstown State (7-4), Dec.
14

Pitt caps the end offinals week with
a matchup against Youngstown State, a
school now notorious in Oakland after
the Penguins defeated the Panthers in
football last year at Heinz Field to begin
the Paul Chryst era.

On the hardwood, the Penguins carry
four players who average double—digit
scoring, led by senior guard Kendrick
Perry and his 19.5 point-per-game aver-
age. Joining Perry are senior forward
Kamren Belin (13.7) and sophomore
forwards Bobby Hain (10.8) and Ryan
Weber (10.7). '

Youngstown State owns one of the
nation’s highest-scoring offenses, with

more than 83 points per game. The
team’s offense is the highest-ranked
unit the Panthers have played and poses
a test for a Pitt defense that allows just
more than 60 points per game.
Pitt vs. Cincinnati (7-1), Dec. 17
Once again, Pitt travels to Madison
Square Garden to take part in thejimmy
V Classic. The contest against Cincinna-
ti might be the most difficult game Pitt
plays in its non-conference schedule.
Cincinnati is one of only 14 teams in
the nation that boasts a better defense
than.Pitt, ranking a spot above the Pan-
thers at fifth in the nation by virtue
of allowingjust 56.4 points per game.
Senior guard Sean Kilpatrick leads
Cincinnati with averages of 19.7 points

Bowl

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football is going bowling for the sixth
year running. Sunday night, the Panthers
accepted an invitation to play against
Bowling Green State University in the
Little Caesars Pizza Bowl at Ford Field
in Detroit on Dec. 26.

“We’re excited for the chance to play in
another game against such a quality op-
ponent,” Pitt head coach Paul Chryst said
in a press release. “We are grateful to the
Little Caesars Pizza Bowl and the city of
Detroit for offering us this opportunity.”

Bowling Green (10 -3, 7-1 MAC) upset
then—No. 14 Northern Illinois last week
with a 47-27 victory to clinch the Mid-
American Conference Championship.
The Falcons from Bowling Green, Ohio,
ﬁnished eighth in the nation in yards al—
lowed and ﬁnished ﬁfth in scoring de-
fense by allowing only 14.8 points per
game.

‘ “Bowling Green was impressive not
only in their MAC Championship win, but
all season long, and we have a competi-
tive game of football ahead,” Chryst said.
