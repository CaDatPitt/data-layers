Scientists contend winter gloom causes depression

Heidi Price

   

Oakland is gloomy.
There’s no denying that.

For the past couple of
weeks Pitt students and fac-
ulty have marched through
the grey slush and‘ icy side-
walks on their way to and
from classes.

But some say the winter
snow and ice, coupled with
days that grow dark by din-
ner time, can cause a form of
depression known as
Seasonal Affective Disorder.

The cold and darkness
often keep people inside
their homes and out of the

sunlight, a lack of which sci-
entists believe causes the
disorder. For those affected
by SAD, the winter months

should be evaluated,” Miller
said. “I’ve had people who
thought they had SAD and
were in fact [manic-depres-

need for sleep that

season and end when
spring begins.

In a Pitt News “on the
street” survey, many stu-
dents questioned said they
had some of the symptoms
related to SAD, but many of
the experiences they
described were mild.

“It’s just a general all-
around sluggishness,” said
senior Laura Hutchins, 24.

“I get sleepy in the win-
ter,” said Karen Hawkins,
30, a junior. “I watch more
television.”

One Pitt student
described a more severe
experience with SAD and
the successful use of light
therapy to treat it. “Three
years ago I would spend one
day out of bed and three
days in bed,” said junior
Karen Coyne, 22. “I lost
jobs because of it.”

There seems to be a
treatment available for peo-
ple with such severe symp-

toms “Light therapy should
be regarded as a first-line
treatment, given its high
success and acceptance rate
[for this disorder],” accord-
ing to the Journal of the
American Medical
Association.

This form of therapy is
strongly advocated by Neal
Owens, president of the
SunBox Company, which
manufactures “light boxes.”

Light boxes are lamps
designed to simulate the sun
during the winter months,
and people suffering from
SAD can position them-
selves in front of the device

Bus plunges off bridge into
Nile; 39 killed, 29 injured

Around the World

CAIRO, Egypt — At least 39 people
were killed and 29 injured when a bus
drove through a metal fence and fell

3 off a bridge into the muddy waters of

the Nile on Tuesday. The bus landed
close to the shore and was nearly
buried in the mud. Interior Minister
Hassan e1—A1fy said that the steep drop
from the bridge and the mud oozing
into the bus were the reasons for the
high number of deaths. Witnesses said
that the bus was speeding when it
veered into the other lane and wrecked
into the river. Associated Press

ATHENS, Greece — Archaeologists
in Greece believe they have found
Aristot1e’s school. The Lyceum is
where the Greek philosopher taught
nearly 2,500 years ago. The archaeol-
ogists were digging in the location of
a planned museum when they found a

large fourth—century B.C. gymnasium
that is thought to be part of the
Lyceum that Aristotle founded in 335
B.C. Archaeologists believe that the
museum and the ruins can co-exist.

THE PITT NEWS

Memory of Martin Luther King
honored by diverse panel

 

A'i_R-.A'?<' 1'9

   

Thirty years ago, a panel composed
of different races mingling and talking
about sexual orientation, occupations,
and cultures would have been contro-
versial.

But in 1997, the rules have
changed.

Yesterday at noon, the School of
Social Work held a nationally—televised
conference in David Lawrence Hall in
recognition of Dr. Martin Luther
King’s birthday. Latinos, African

' Americans, Asians, and Caucasians

made up the panel. The panel was cho-
sen by the National Conference and
served to challenge stereotypes about
race and crossing “ethnic and cultural
boundaries.”

The eight panelists discussed many
issues including gender, sexual orienta-
tion, occupations, and culture, reminis-
cent of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s coined
term, the “Rainbow Coalition.”

“This is just the start of our venture
to helping communities across the
country,” said Sanford Cloud, Jr., pres-
ident of the National Conference. “This
will act as a stepping stone, like a
model, to commence with future con-
ferences on a more consistent basis. We
do this because of Dr. King’s message
and the role he displayed as a peace-
maker and an equal opportunist.”

Many claimed one of the most
charismatic of the panelists was
Clarence Page.

A “I thought he was very compelling
because of his controlled use of the
word,” said Tracy M. Soska, director of
the Continuing Education Program. “I
took notice especially to him when he
said, ‘It’s not a matter of someone say-
ing ‘I’m not a racist,’ but to say, ‘I’m
anti—racist.””

The National Conference is one of
the leading forces confronting issues of
race in workplaces and everyday rela-
tionships.

“In relation to campuses, nation-
wide, I think forums like these will be
very conducive, becausethe university
community is a place of learning and
thoughtful dialogue,” said Cloud.

The National Conference serves
communities through 62 branches
across the nation, with large—scale tele-
casts and local—based sponsorships.

Cloud said the National Conference .

branches can give everyone the chance
to reach his full potential.

In presenting the diverse display of
panelists yesterday afternoon, the
National Conference is starting to
reach Dr. King’s dream. Dr. King and
his message of equality by means of
non-violence were in full representa-
tion.

“I feel Dr. King was a great leader
because of his impeccable strength,
perseverance, and dedication,” said
John Woodson, a Black Action Society
member. “Just as we do  around this
time celebrate his birth and achieve-
ment, let us still not forget the struggle
the masses still fight for.”

Anna Deavere Smith, a panelist
and an award-winning performance
artist, opened with a riveting perfor-
mance based on two women. One was
Jewish, from Crown Heights,
Brooklyn; and the other was an Asian
woman living in the period following
the 1992 riots in Los An-geles.

For panelist Linda Chavez, a USA
Today columnist, Smith captured the
essence of expression and emotions.

“She gets inside the skin of these
women to express the views and feel-
ings that so many hold,” Chavez said.

Other panelists included Colonel
Maragrethe Cammerrneyer, the high-
est-ranking military officer discharged
for her sexual orientation; Karen
Naraski, the executive director of
National Asian Pacific American Legal
Consortium; and U.S. Senator
Christopher Dodd.

Also present were Clarence Page, a
Pulitzer Prize winning syndicated
columnist; and Alberto Ibarguen, pub-
lisher of El Nuevo Herald and vice
president of international operations at
the Miami Herald.

The program was nationally broad-
casted via satellite. The broadcast was
a joint venture presented by Civic
Network Television, the Connecticut
Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities, and Aetna, Inc.

Abul-Ela is Kappa Sigma’s gentleman on campus

.I_|.(aren Urbanik

" Nader Ahmed Abul-Ela has always been
active, but his college years are testing his atten-
tion span.

Abul-Ela is the president of Kappa Sigma,
a fraternity that is trying to get their national char-
ter this spring, and the community service chair
for Alpha Kappa Psi, the undergraduate business
fraternity. He is also Kappa Sigrna’s IFC repre-
sentative and a member of the judiciary board.

In the Pitt community, he also sits on the
council for Keeping Bigelow Boulevard Closed.
He said he believes the closing of Bigelow will

’ unify the campus and open options for utilizing

the area.
Abul-Ela makes it a point to stay involved
in every aspect of his life.

 

“I’m very genuine about the things Ibelieve
in,” Abul-Ela said. “I stand behind what I say.”

Abul-Ela balances his time between going
to bars for dancing and fun and attending to his
religious convictions. Abul-Ela, a Muslim, said
he ﬁnds it is easy to maintain his religious beliefs
because of the men in Kappa Sigma. He said it is
important for him to have such a close relation-
ship with his brothers since the Muslim faith
does not allow any substance that alters the mind,
including alcohol. Abul-Ela, who attends
Muslim services every Friday afternoon, said he
feels comfortable with his brothers because they
respect his beliefs.

As the son of a doctor, Abul-Ela said he
learned early in life what it means to be dedicat-
ed. His friends agree. A

?‘Nader is a president who listens to the
members of the fraternity and, because of that, he

has enabled us to realize our potential as both
individuals and as a group,” said Marc Shea,
community service committee chair for Kappa
Sigma. “I honestly don’t know how far along we
would be in this process of acquiring our charter
if Nader hadn’t been the leader of Kappa
Sigma.” ‘

Fratemity members look up to Abul-Ela for
his leadership abilities.

“He is an enthusiastic, intelligent business
and sports-oriented individual who uncompara—
bly leads us to our. goals,” said Jeff Fortier,
Kappa Sigma secretary who has been working
along side Abul-Ela since the fratemity was
founded.

Abul-Ela also recognizes that his brothers
depend on him for leadership. Though his abili-
ty to steer the group towards their goal has been
strong, Abul-Ela said he realizes that he needs to

also focus on guiding himself toward a better
position in his own view.

“I want to learn to build up my conﬁdence
with each of my successes,”Abul-Ela said, “And
learn from my mistakes.”

Ed King, a member of Kappa Sigma, noted
that Abul-Ela is the stronghold in their hopes to
receive their national charter.

“He does what needs to be done without
asking for recognition,” King said. “If programs
need to be turned in, phone calls need to be
made, he does them, but he doesn’t feel it neces-
sary to tell everyone how much he does.”

Regardless of all the time and work Abul-

Ela puts into his activities, he is able to maintain
the goals set forth by his brothers when they ﬁrst
began.

“As long as there is a gentleman on this
campus,” Abul-Ela said, “There is a Kappa Sig.”

ODK SENIOR OF THE YEAR AWARD

Applications are being accepted for the Senior of the Year
Award of Gamma Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa Society. The
Award recipient will be recognized at the Honors Convocation on
Friday, February 28, 1997. Any senior graduating in 1997 is
eligible for this award. Candidates will be evaluated on the basis
of Character, scholarship, leadership, and activities. Applications
are available in Room 140 William Pitt Union and are due by

Friday, January 24, 1997.

AWARD _
The award presented to the senior chosen by the committee
shall consist of a stone in the ODK walk between Heinz Chapel
and the Cathedral on which the awardee’s name shall be chiseled.
In addition, Omicron Delta Kappa Society shall present the
awardee a certificate attesting that the individual is the recipient
of the Senior Award.

PURPOSE
The purpose of the SENIOR AWARD shall twofold:

First, to recognize annually the senior student who has attained a
high standard of leadership in collegiate activities, to encourage
that individual to continue along this line, and to inspire others to
strive for similar conspicuous attainments. Second, to recognize
that type of student who, in the opinion of the committee, the

‘ University should aim to produce.

 

 

President Clinton’s fonner chief advisor, will

Sounds expensive, right? Not really. Uy and
her group attempted to land talk show giant

. Oprah Winfrey until they discovered her $70,000

price tag — this too just covers the lecture.

“We tried to get Elizabeth Dole here too, but
she charges a $50,000 honorarium,” Uy said.
“We tried for Hillary [Rodharn-Clinton], but they
told us she was ‘very busy’. She would’ve prob-
ably cost an arm and a leg, 

Aside from Stephanopolous, the committee
will present a lecture by human rights advocate

for Valentine’s Day.

Other upcoming PPC events include daily I

art exhibits, a serrrinar on apartment hunting, a
trip to the Civic Arena for a Penguins/Flyers
hockey game, and the Spring Break trip to
Panama City Beach.

Students can get a complete schedule of
these and other events and movies sponsored by
the PPC at the William Pitt Union. The commit-
tees also welcome any comments or suggestions
for improvement at 648-7900.

“A lot of people don’t realize it, but we’re

here for the students,” Uy said.

Owens said he himself experi-

early in the 1980s.

changed profes-

by the absence of warmth, she
advises hot showers.

Owens thinks that SAD should
be of particular concern to college
students in their twenties because,
“this is a time in
life where there
are the most pres-
sures.”

But Miller
disagrees, and says
the disorder is
much more likely
to strike older peo-
ple.

“SAD is more
common in the
third decade of
life,” said Miller, -who has treated
between 50 and 100 cases in the past
five years at Western Psych. “It also
affects women more than it affects
men by something like  5 to 1.”

Though the University of
Pittsburgh faces some of the
gloomiest and coldest weather dur-
ing its “spring” semester, Miller
stressed how rare the disorder is and
warns people who feel they have
these symptoms against se1f-diagno-

A new study of how lead affects col-
lege students has researchers trying to
correlate lead levels to SAT scores.

Dr. Herbert Needleman, professor of
psychiatry and pediatrics and director of
the lead research group at Pitt, is study-
ing college students to see if there is a
correlation between their lead levels and
SAT scores.

Working with Christine McFarland,
coordinator of the lead study, and two
research assistants — Heather Reeves,
and Carolina Diaz—Peroza —- data col-
lected from 1,000 Pitt students will be
analyzed over the next ﬁve months.

“We measure the amount of lead in
the bones by a non-invasive X—ray proce-
dure, and then we

the main source of lead exposure is in the
paint for houses, and many houses are
painted with lead paint. We want to get
federal funding to help pay for the costs
of repainting those houses.”

Needleman played a key role in the
govemment’s decision to ban lead from
gasoline and paint with his research in
1979.

His research was the first to study
lead levels in the teeth of subjects. All
previous tests measured lead levels in the

“Measuring the levels in the teeth
will give better results because unlike

and teeth,” Needleman said.

to ﬁnd out if there
is an association
between high lead

scores, and added
that in this study, a large diversity of peo-
ple are being examined, and anybody can
participate.

The student subjects commonly ask
the researchers if they will be injected
with lead if they haven’t previously been
subjected to lead exposure.

“Everybody has been exposed to
lead over the course of their life, and
that’s what we measure, we don’t inject
any kind of lead substance into the stu-
dents,” said McFarland.

Another research project Needleman
said would be beneﬁcial is a study of the
long—terrn effects of lead in the bones of
the elderly.

“As a person gets older their bones
get thinner. I wonder what happens to the
lead in their bones  could the lead be
the cause of some of the elderly’s prob-
lems? At this point no one has taken on
this project yet,” Needleman said.

According to Needleman, the new,
sensitive equipment for measuring lead
levels shows that higher lead levels caus-
es more problems than researchers
thought in the past. This could prove to
be instrumental in attaining federal help
in banning lead in house paint.

“One of the most important public
health actions in history was taking lead
out of gasoline,” Needleman said. “Now

The follow—up
study found that
subjects with high-
er lead levels were
less likely to gradu-
ate from high school and were more like-
ly to develop reading disabilities. He said
that in general, subjects “were less
inclined to do well in society.”

In another study Needleman con-
ducted, he measured the lead levels of
300 boys attending Pittsburgh public
schools and found a correlation between
lead levels and delinquent behavior.

“The children with high lead levels
were more aggressive, more delinquent,
and more likely to be involved in antiso-
cial behavior than the children with low
levels of lead,” said Needleman.

His previous research ﬁndings are
what sparked his new study involving
college students. According to
Needleman, most studies of lead and the
effects on brain function look at the peo-
ple doing poorly, but never looked at the
people that are doing well.

Needleman’s research has encour-
aged government ofﬁcials to take action
in the past and he said he hopes his
research will do so again in the future. He
adds that even though very few children
with lead poisoning die anymore, lead
exposure can cause permanent brain
damage.

Let's remember King in a
way he would appreciate

A few months ago, there was talk about closing Bigelow
Boulevard permanently and making it part of the campus. Some of our
brother and sister students (not the fraternities and sororities), gathered
together to bang drums on the Cathedral lawn and think of ways to do
this. The Pitt News was there, and we brought you the words of the
student known only as Paco, who said: “We can blow some shit up.”
This, however, isn’t the way to go.

Monday is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. While we sit not going
to class, thinking about another assignment or recovering from anoth-
er night of the Forbes Avenue crawl, perhaps its time to consider what
this holiday is all about

Martin Luther King, Jr. advocated the use of non—violent protest
and civil disobedience in order to affect positive change in society. The
Pitt News has been talking about civil disobedience lately, and it is
important to recognize the power that comes ﬁom exercising these
rights.

First of all, the bookstore: we’ve given suggestions about how to
deal with over-priced books. Make sure people are aware of the fact
that books are over-priced. There is a difference between civil disobe-
dience and a guerrilla economy.

The closing of Bigelow Boulevard, if the student government
board has their way, is not a dead issue yet. If people really want the
road closed, they need to think about ways of actively working for clo-
sure. Showing up at meetings of the Oakland Business and Civic
Association, showing up at City Council, and showing up on Bigelow
Boulevard are ways to do this.

Everyone complains about the Block system and the cafeterias.
Marriott’s contract is up in July. Now is the time for students to make
their voices heard. You do not have to have a meal plan if you are
unsatisﬁed with the system or the fare, even though they tell you that
you must Remember, there are no choice dollars that are as widely
accepted as cash.

One of the other lessons that we learned ﬁorn King is that we
must organize and use what we do to beneﬁt everyone. King’s dream
is still alive. While it may seem trivial to compare the civil rights
movement to the closure of Bigelow, what we can show is that we
have learned something better ﬁorn the past than fear and loathing.

fomted by the renewing of your mind.
— Romans 12:2 (NIV)

I note, with considerable irony,
just how hard some people in the
black community fought to make
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s "birthday a
civil holiday.

They might reconsider if they
actuallytookthetimetolistentowhat
he said and did

While I’m far too young to
remember just what happened during
the civil rights movement, I certainly
do have impressions considering the
historylhave alreadyread Based on
those impressions, it’s no mystery
why the movement has become a
shell of itself in my lifetime.

You see, I don’t think you can
truly appreciate the civil rights move-
ment without an understanding of the
Christian faith, which calls for an
inner transformation as the result of a
personal encounter with God through
Jesus Christ. In fact, (and this is rarely
stressed) the movement sprang
directly ﬁorn prayer meetings in
black churches in the South, the only
avenues available to blacks at that
time, and the vast majority of com-
munity leaders then came from the
clergy.

At the appointed time, God
raised up a prophet out of an unlikely
place — the Dexter Avenue Baptist
Church in Montgomery, Ala.

That exclusive social club, Dr.
King’s ﬁrst pastorate, was populated
largely by professionals who cared

A about little more than maintaining

their class status and looking down
on people who weren’t quite like
themselves. In a television movie
about King’s predecessor, Rev. Dr.

Vernon Johns — a radical, especially
for that time — members com-
plained, among other things, that
Johns’ forceful sermons on Jesus
Christ and social justice “robbed the
pulpit of dignity.”

Needless to say, that had to
change. (The mindset, that is, not the
sermons.)

Anyway, by the time
Montgomery police anested Johns
from the pulpit and the church subse-
quently ﬁred him, many of its mem-
bers were indeed ready to take action.

In came Dr. King, fresh from
Boston University — and, as they
say, the rest was history.

I hope by now that you see
where I’m coming from.

In order to effect permanent
change in society, people must main-
tain a proper relationship with God
and undergo their own spiritual trans-
formation in order to understand just
how to do it. These days, however,
the movement has taken on an atti-
tude of “We’re right, so why don’t we
just go out and get what’s ours?”

The results? Some blacks
thought they could go it alone and
have occasionally since told sympa-
thetic whites to leave. “We Shall
Overcome” became “We Shall
Overrun.” Many still thought that
once they had enough money, racism
would simply disappear. (Funny,
white conservatives wary of a post-
apartheid South Aﬁica made the
same argument.) In the end, in doing
so, they became, quoting the classic
spiritual, “drunk with the wine of the
worl .”:

Sadly, many in the black com-
munity also completely forgot that
they didn’t just earn those victories in
the streets and the courts —— God
gave them to them as long as they
maintained his vision for reconcilia-

He we Lam.
°“““miZf}l§.I

    

f

God gave 5 our civil rights, people

tion as well as justice and freedom
Dr. King, you see, knew that racism
hurt whites as much as blacks, if only
because hate, in his words, “corrodes
the personality and eats away its vital
unity.”

As I said last year, we no longer
desire the “Promised Land” Dr. King
spoke of and we said we longed for.
His dream of reconciliation has been
bypassed in favor of a campaign of
confrontation that has confused white
liberals and alienated almost every-
one else. I remember a passage in
Eldridge Cleaver’s classic (but, ulti-
mately, misguided) book Soul on Ice,
where he had Malcolm X ask Dr.
King rhetorically, “Lazarus, how
come you’re not dead?” Ironically, it
was Dr. King who became the new,
transformed man and Malcolm who
represented the old ways.

.And that’s why all the direct
action —— the marches, speeches, and
boycotts — no longer works. To use
a Biblical analogy, most of the activi-
tyforthelast25 yearsorsohasbeen
attempted “in the ﬂesh.”

So, what needs to happen in
order to deal with entrenched injus-
tice? I point to a campaign 11 years
ago at a church in Cleveland: “Get
changed, get together, get going!”

' Reform your own thinking.

Endeavor not to play the same
old stupid racial games, by building
relationships based on trust and hon-
esty with whomever is willing, black,
white, or whatever.

Don’t be afraid to reach out to
strangers.

Because, and I know Dr. King
would agree with rrre on this, if you
don’t want reconciliation, you don’t
really want justice. _

Pennsyl native eps Pitt tradition going

TPN: What initially sparked your interest in wrestling?

LS: I was probably a little older when I started than most kids
who wrestle in college. A lot of guys who are wrestling at this
level started in second or third grade. I started when I was in
sixth grade. Middletown had a middle-school wrestling
team, and I was a hyperactive kid, so it just kind of clicked.
I had an excellent coach, Ed Amdt. He really inspired me to
work hard and taught me to love the sport.

TPN: VVrth so many outstanding wrestling schools  e

Pennsylvania, what made you choose to attend Pitt?
LS: I first heard from Pitt when I was a sophomore. They
sent me a recruiting letter. I didn’t hear from them again, so
I called them back when I was a senior. Scott Hovan was the
graduate assistant then — he handled all the recruiting. Then
I came out here for a visit and I fell in love with the place.
TPN: With the wrestling team off to a good start (5-1), you
have to be pleased with how the season is unfolding.
LS: We’re deﬁnitely sitting in a good spot right now. I don’t
think we’ve wrestled our best yet. We wrestled great at
Bloornsburg, but since then we haven’t done as well. We’re
still winning though, and that’s a good sign. The bulk of our
matches are in the second semester [including the bulk of the
conference matches]. There have been a lot of upsets in the
EWLthis year. I think we have as good a chance to win the
EWL as anyone.
TPN: What are your goals for this season, both personally
and for the team?
LS: I’m cutting down [to the 142—lb. weight class] for the rest
of the semester. Competition is a lot tougher at 142. I’ll have
my work cut out for me. First I’ll have to beat [Mike] Dixon
in a wrestle-oﬂ‘. That will be tough in itself —— he’s been the
starter all year.

Then I’ll have to wrestle some of the toughest guys in

the country later in the season. I’ll have to wrestle the num-
ber-one-ranked guy at 142 [Rodger Chandler of Indiana];
and Kerry Kolat [of Penn State], who is the number-one guy
at 134 (but right now he’s wrestling at 142); plus some other
tough guys like Steve Fekin [of Edinboro], who is a two-time
national qualiﬁer.

My goal is to-knock some of those guys olf. I’l1 deﬁ-
nitely have a chance to prove myself. It’s just up to me to get
out there and do it.

Asfarastheteamgoes,Iwanttoﬁnishinthetop 15 in

the nation. I think we have a real good chance at doing:that;..,

And even more so, I’d love an EWL championship ring.
TPN: This year’s recruiting class was ranked the 10th best in
the nation. What is your impression of the freshmen so far?
LS: By far they’re the most talented freshmen since I’ ve
been here. They’ve made the transition to college wrestling
quickly. Rob Loper is one of the best kids in the country on
his feet right now. He only lost to Mark Angle [nephew of
Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle] by two points.

Nick Mengerick is redshirted this year, but I think he’s
going to be an excellent wrestler. I’ve wrestled him in prac-
tice and he’s tough.

Matt Mueller is going to be an excellent heavyweight.
His style is different than most heavyweights. He doesn’t just
tie up, he’s quick on his feet and has a good outside shot.

Things look really promising for the freshmen, provid-
ed the guys stay healthy and work hard. I think Pitt wrestling
has a real bright future.

TPN: How beneﬁcial has the Pitt coaching staff been to your
success on the mat? _

LS: They’ve helped me a great deal both on and oﬂ° the mat.
Coach Stottlemyer is always stressing academics. And as far
as wrestling goes, they’ll do anything for us. They’re not

gonna grab your hand and force you to be tough, you have
to be willing to work hard.

IfI called Coach [Dan] Payne or [Ed] Palmer and asked
them to work out at six in the morning tomonow, I can
almost guarantee they would be there.

I think Coach Stottlemyer’s experience helps a lot too.
He’s been coaching college wrestling for 17 years.

TPN: What is the most rewarding part of wrestling?
LS: There is nothing better than winning. I hate to lose and I
love to win. You’re out there on the mat and it’s just you and

fithe other guy. There’s no one else to blame if you lose. That’s
why I think it’s more rewarding than football or baseball and

other team sports.

The camaraderie in wrestling is great too. I’ll be telling
my kids and grandkids stories about my wrestling years.
TPN: What are your plans for the future? Do they include
wrestling in any way? -

LS: I’m a health and physical education major. I’m going to
get my bachelor’s degree this year and I’ll get a teaching cer-
tiﬁcate next year. I deﬁnitely want to coach after I graduate.

I think I’ ve been blessed with a lot of good role models.
I’ve had some excellent teachers and coaches, and my par-
ents are great I don’t think I would have made it to college
without them. They’ve always been willing to go the extra
mile for me. Just last weekend, my mom drove from
Hanisburg to Slippery Rock for our match. She stayed
overnight in a hotel, and on Saturday she got up, drove all the
way back to Harrisburg to pick up my dad, turned right
around and drove back to Ohio State for our match there on
Sunday.

I’d like to be able to give back some of the help I
received growing up. I hope I can inspire kids, not just to be
good wrestlers, but to work hard at everything.

The Pitt hockey team started off
the new year the same way they ended
the old one: winning hockey games
and retaining sole possession of first
place in its division.

The Panthers defeated the Steel
Stars 7-5 last Sunday in
Cranberry Township, improving their
overall record to 8-1-1, 5-0-1 in the
Western division.

Leading Pitt was Captain Bill
Elliott with four points. Pitt’s Mike
Girvin, Dan Gynn, Brad Rizzo, and
newcomer Jason Darby each scored a
goal helping the Panthers’ cause. Dave
Ciarletta got his first start and win in
the net for Pitt with 16 saves.

From the drop of the puck, Pitt
dominated play. The Panthers took a
1-0 lead 27 seconds into the first peri-
od when Girvin scored, assisted by
Darby, who was playing in his first
Pitt hockey game.

“Darby won the face-off, then
passed it through two defensemen,”
Head’ Coach Dickie Rizzo said.
“Girvin one-timed it in.”

Two minutes later, Gynn scored
for Pitt after stopping and redirecting
a shot by Dan Woodbury, giving Pitt a
2-0 lead. .

“I stopped the puck before it got to

the net,” Gynn said. “I faked to my
right, then went to my left and put the
puck between his legs.”

A minute later, Steel City got on
the scoreboard when Bill Swartz beat
Ciarletta making it 2-1.

Down by a goal, Steel City went
on the power play and had a chance to
tie the game. Instead, Elliott scored a
short-handed goal, giving Pitt a 3-1
lead midway through the first period.

Elliott took advantage when the
puck jumped out of the Panthers’ end.
Elliott was joined in his up-ice charge
by Ryan Moore.

“Moore went around a guy and we
went in 2-0 on the goalie,” Elliott said.

Four minutes later, Steel City
goaltender, Steve Kratsa, heard from
Elliott again. This time Elliott was on
a breakaway.

“Brad gave me a nice pass,”
Elliott said. “I went in on a breakaway
and scored.”

With a 4-1 lead, the Panthers con-
tinued to pressure Steel City. Pitt’s
determination, despite a three-goal
lead, paid off.

Twenty seconds later, Darby
scored assisted by Rizzo and Elliott
giving Pitt a 5-1 lead with over five
minutes still remaining in the first
period.

way, but it wouldn’t. The Panthers
owned the first period and proved it by
adding another goal.

Elliott made the third time a
charm, as he got the hat trick scoring
his third goal of the contest assisted by
Anthony Muffi and Bob Hoehn.

With the Panthers on a power play,
Elliott stood patiently alone in front of
the Steel City net. Muffi made the pass
and Elliott scored to the upper-right
corner of the net, giv-
ing Pitt a 6-1 lead
with 3:32 left in the
first period. E

The scoring
dropped off with the
start of the second
period. Both teams
skated scoreless until
the 10:04 mark.

Pitt set up the
power play, and once
again it was
Woodbury shooting
from the point. This time, Rizzo
tipped in the puck, scoring his first
goal since his return and giving Pitt a
7-1 lead.

The Stars’ goalie, Kratsa, was
pulled and replaced by Bryan Dommer
after Rizzo’s goal.

Ahead by six goals, Pitt began to
pile up the penalties, giving Steel City
the chance to make a comeback. The

Panthers, no strangers to taking penal-
ties, found themselves on the penalty
kill for basically the remainder of the
game and lost Rizzo, who was ejected
for fighting. -

“The guys need to be more disci-
plined on taking stupid penalties,”
Assistant Coach Rick Niedt said.
“Penalties kept the Stars in the game.”

Steel City mounted a comeback,
taking advantage of what seemed to be
a neverending Stars
power play. Despite
scoring "four goals to
pull within two of
Pitt, Steel City could-
n’t pull out the win.
The Panthers held on
by virtue of good
defensive efforts,
strong penalty—killing,
and a lot of blocked
shots by Gynn and
Tony Hermankevich.

This weekend,
Pitt has back-to-back games Friday
and Saturday against I.U.P. (Division
1) and I.U.P.(Division 2) in Indiana,
Pa.

With the addition of Rizzo and
Darby, Pitt will have the depth they
need to survive in the playoffs.

“It gives us four solid lines, more
offensive firepower and improves our
power play immensely,” Niedt said. -

Pih‘ track will use Kent meet as mental prep for rest of season

 Meek

:<~......-.-.v:. 2.173;.-:~:-.  r.- .

 

The Pitt men’s and women’s track
teams have been off to fast starts so far
this season. They will look to continue
their success this Saturday at the Doug
Raymond Invitational at Kent State.
The meet is the closest thing Pitt has
to a home meet this season. About 15
schools, mostly from Pennsylvania
and Ohio, are entered in the meet.

“We called the meet at Princeton
[last weekend] a fun meet,” Pitt Coach
Steve Lewis said. “We’re calling Kent
State a work meet. And when we go to
Boston the following week, that’s
called quality.”

Pitt will be looking to accomplish
several goals at Kent State. The “fun”
meet at Princeton was Pitt’s first meet
in four weeks. By working harder this
week, Lewis hopes to prepare the team
mentally for the rest of the season.

At Princeton, the team’s primary
focus was on the relay events. Most of
Pitt’s relay teams qualified for various
postseason meets. The distance med-
ley relay teams were the exception.
One of Pitt’s primary goals for this
weekend’s meet is to put together dis-
tance medley teams that can qualify.

The medley event has one runner
running 400 meters, another running
800, another going 1200, and one run-
ning 1600 meters (about one mile).

The legs are not necessarily run in that
order, however.

“We want to get all our relays
qualified so we can concentrate on
individual events in Boston,” Lewis
said.

Final decisions won’t be made
until race time, but for now, Scott
Curry, Scott Gilpin, Carl Taylor, and
Rich Walsh are scheduled to run the
distance medley for the men. The
women have two teams set to run the
race. One consists of Tamika Dorin,
Anna Kohler, Angie Martin, and
Chantee Earl; the other has Stacey
Anderson, Amy Francy, Lynda
Andros, and Dana McKoy.

A few other relay teams will be

put together, but there will be more
Panthers in individual events than
there were at Princeton, something
especially important for the freshmen.

Last weekend’s “fun” meet helped
the freshmen gain some confidence
heading into the tough part of the sea-
son. The Kent State meet is the begin-
ning of that tough part.

“You couldn’t ask for more effort
and enthusiasm from these freshmen
men and women. These are 18- and
19-year-old kids competing against
23- and 24-year-old men and women.
They’ve quietly had some great per-
formances,” Lewis said.

Coach Lewis is upbeat about his
team’s recent performance and is
looking for more top—notch times this
weekend. “So far we’ve had three

meets and we’ve had nothing but suc-
cess,” Lewis said. “Our captains are
leading us very well. The assistant
coaches are all doing a standout job.
I’m having a good time just watching
them.”

quee players were faced with a bigger
problem than preparing for the opposing
team.

The Cowboy family was faced with
the legal system. Granted, this was the
same system that slapped Irvin on the
wrist in June for his no—contest plea on
cocaine possession charges. Sure, he
should have been punished more severely,
but does his questionable past automati-
cally make him a bulls-eye for any and all
speculation?

There were reports out of Dallas, ini-
tially from Charmel 5’s Marty Grilfm, that
Irvin held a gun to a woman’s head while
Williams and the third man raped her.
There were tapes with Irvin’s voice in the
background. The future wasn’t bright in
Big D for the Playmaker, or the hefty
offensive lineman.

Griffin wasn’t the only media vulture.
Newspeople from around the country
journeyed to Cowboy headquarters to
watch as Irvin would surely crumble and
face probation violations and jail time.
Sports reporters started to speculate as to
who would take the starting spots for the
accused pair.

be noticed in this light.

This woman has made a mockery of a

THE PITT NEWS

are the Dallas Police going to do to find
Shahravan now that she has ﬂed the Dallas
area, following her admission of falsifying
police documents?

If the Friday confession by Shahravan
is true and the accusations against Irvin
and Williams are ﬁnally found to be total-
ly false, what happens to the tapes that
were "confiscated from Williams’ home?
Will they be turned back over to
Vlfilliarns?

“Did they exist at all?” might be a bet-
ter question.

There are an abundance of loose ends
in this story. A story that was irresponsibly
broken and then allowed to grow expo-
nentially. .

Marty Grifﬁn was right in jumping on
a potentially huge story. He was wrong in

AM  .

 

the way he followed up on the accusa-
tions.

The media frenzy produced sound
bytes and press conferences with everyone
from Irvin and Williams themselves to
their lawyers to Lt. David Goelden of the
Dallas Police Department. In the end,
work by the police did bring the truth to
light. But something must be done to
ensure that something like this doesn’t rear
its ugly head again. .

Members of the media will have to
explain themselves time and time again
until the next gargantuan story surfaces,
and rightfully so. But there is a much larg-
er problem here. Forget about the
Cowboys organization, the Dallas Police
Department, and the slew of radio, televi-
sion, and newspaper reporters. These peo-

 

 FROM PAGE 8

 

ple will move on, and eventually the story
will become just a memory for sports fans

Think about the families of Irvin and
Williams, and especially Nina Shahravan.
Where do they go from here? Irvin and
Wﬂliains have security in their profession-
al lives, but will stories like this, true or
not, end with the Cowboys? When will
Irvin’s wife and the rest of his family put
their collective foot down and say enough
is enough? Hopefully Ms. Shahravan real-
izes what she has done to set back the fight
against crimes like rape and assault. ‘

Soon enough she will have plenty of
time to think about her 15 minutes of
fame.

Madonna

Evita
Directed by Alan Parker
Starring Madonna, Antonio

Banderas, J onathan. Pryce

For those of you who are expecting
Madonna to fail in the long awaited
movie version of Evita, I would sug-
gest looking elsewhere. Madonna
proves that not only has her voice gone
well beyond that of pop singing, but
that she is also capable of quality act-
ing. The film, as a whole, is superbly
done. And it’s a shame that so many
will choose to avoid‘ it based solely on
the fact that Madonna stars in it.
Ironically, people will probably be as
divided about Madonna’s performance
as Argentineans were (and still are)
about Eva Peron. Coming from noth-
ing and nowhere, Eva Peron all but
clawed her way to a position of power
and then proceeded to give all she had
to the peasant class. She managed to
do it all with the conviction and charis-
ma of a female Robin Hood/Diva.

Director Alan Parker has taken on
the difficult task of Evita, and turned it
into a musical docu-drama of epic pro-
portions. Parker reflects the two ways
in which Argentineans felt about Eva
Peron. We see the triumph and self-
lessness of Eva herself compared to the
feelings of anger and rebellion as sung

 

by Ché (Antonio Banderas). Banderas
also shows that he is much better suit-
ed for comic roles as opposed to his
recent slew of mindless action movies.

The final gem of Evita is certainly
Jonathan Pryce’s role as Peron. Pryce’s
last film Carrington had him playing
the beautiful and decrepit writer Lytton
Strachey. After this ﬂawless perfor-

mance, one would fear that he would
be forever typecast. Thankfully, this
was not the case. Pryce’s Peron is vir-
ile,.believable and amazing.

Perhaps the only thing in the film
that warrants criticism is Jimmy Nails’
rather whimpy Migaldi. Sadly, he lacks
the charisma and voice that the original
Broadway actor Mark Syers had.

2-

    

Jonathon Pryce and Madonna prove their talents as those crazy, lovable Perons in Evita.

Nevertheless, Evita is an impor-
tant historical film that everyone
should see —— and if you hate Madonna
so much that you ﬂat out refuse to
go,then maybe it’s a good thing that
you don’t  the big screen may not be
narrow enough for your mind.

Let’s face it, if you’re not
21-years old in this state,
you’re pretty much fucked as

surely be in the house (the

features

not true at every bar, though.
For several months now, fans
of live rock (and every possi-

options go. There’s an all-
ages show about once every
millennium. This week, how-
ever, would seem to be differ-
ent!'There are at least three
(count ‘em—, three!) ALL-

here’s a few things to keep
you busy:

More all—ages fun, in the

Saturday’s show brings us the
legendary Plow United, from
Philadelphia, Pa. Also from
Philly are their tourmates
Super Hi-5 and Throttle

of their East-coast tour, and
what better way to celebrate
than with Pittsburgh’s own

this town. Most bars are too
scared to serve up live music,
and those that do proceed to
rape you at the door. This is

. every

   

Pittsburgh’ have frequented
the most consistently enter-
taining, challenging, and
purely rockin’ venue in town
week. Rickety
Tuesdays at the Tobacco
Roadhouse (which I still call
the Decade) have built up a
substantial following these
past few months, and it’s not
hard to figure out why:
therek no other place left to
go!

Not only is every show
just a buck, with one dollar
beer & booze specials to
boot, but some of the greatest
bands that Pittsburgh hasito
offer have been playing there

 

Skatepark of Pittsburgh

A new skatepark has been
operating in the Pittsburgh area
for a couple months now. lt‘s
called Skatepark of Pittsburgh.
It‘s not too far from the airport.

This park kills it. A smooth.
fast. I6-foot—wide. seven—foot—
high mini-ramp with an exten-
sion sits in the back —- deinand—
ing assault. The street course is
fun and has big obstacles.
Limited space does away with
street simulated obstacles (like
boxes and rails). but the quarter-
pipes. bank ramps, and the wall
ride all allow for lengthy runs. A
round wall quarter—pipe covers
about 24 feet from end to end
and continually whips you back
in the fight with more speed. The
parklopens at 4:00 p.m. and clos-
es at l():()0 p.m. all week. so
there’s plenty of skating hours
that can accommodate all types
of schedules. Everything
remains indoors for now. but
rumor has it that a vert ramp.
street course. and maybe a con-
crete bowl will be built outdoors
after the spring thaw.

Jerry Fleig owns and runs
the park with the help of some
friends. Jerry used to let dudes
skate his seven—foot mini ramp
when it was still up in
Sewickley. Sometimes. when he
was working nearby. he would
put» down his tools and take
some runs on the ramp. I guess
he must have been stoked on
that. because he soon put his
ramp-building skills to work on
the park. The usual difficulties
— like insurance —— which often
close parks before they open. did
not stop this park from finally
being built. Now Pittsburgh has
its own full—time. skater—owned
and operated park. So get out
there and skate. Your decision to
have fun can only result in more
good things to come for
Pittsburgh skateboarding.

To get there. take route 27‘)
S. to (10 N. Go a few miles past
the airport. and take the

«Hopewell exit. Stay right. go

through the light; drive along.
and make a sharp left turn down-
hill soon after the Texaco. Drive
some more. Look for the school
and make the left just after it.
Follow that narrow and winding
road. You might feel lost, but

you’re almost there. Watch for

the “Skatepark of Pittsburgh"
sign on the left.

Mobb Deep
Heﬂ on Earth
RCA/Loud Records

Rap music has always been about bat-
tling. Try to ﬁnd a rap song without a put-
down. It can’t be done. But what started in
the late 70s as “I’m better than you,” has
been replaced in the 90s by “Fuck with me,
and I’ll kill you.” Although the recent efforts
of acts such as the Roots, the Fugees, and
the Pharcyde have shown that there is a
market for irmovative lyricists who don’t
have criminal records, maﬁoso crime stories

continue to make big money. Enter Mobb

Deep.

This Queensbridge, New York duo
made some noise in the summer of ‘95 with
their exceptional second album, Tha
Infamous. Boosted by tight production and
street savvy, the Mobb’s Havoc and Prodigy
seemed poised to follow the lead of fellow
QBC—native Nas toward the status of rap
stardom. But if Nas is the crime boss of East
Coast rap, Mobb Deep are little more than a
couple of henchrnan.

Hell on Earth, the duo’s new album,
serves as the soundtrack for an urban tenor-
ist ﬂick; a place where the neighborhood
feels like Beirut and even your closest
friends have become the enemy. Musically,
the album is appealing on a number of lev-
els. The group’s production is outstanding,
as enormous basslines complement their
hostile retribution rhymes. Strings emerge
through clouds of gun smoke and acidic
piano loops surround dusty snare drums.
Quality samples, such as the Clash of the
Titans snippet on “Nighttime Vultures,”
giveMobbDeephighmari<sasfarasbeats
go.

But while the beats may be hard to
resist, the Mobb’s lyrics may be equally-
hard to stomach. There are no gimmicks, no
party raps, just 60 minutes of torturous
threats. The album’s major ﬂaw is its redun-
dancy. There is a certain finality in the act of
murder that seems to escape the Mobb’s
comprehension. They want to kill you, then
kill you some more. A malnourished, one-
dimensional vocal approach will have lis-
tener’s hungry for cameos by other rappers
(of which there are several). An insolent
Method Man blesses the track “Extortion,”
Raekwon livens up “Nighttime Vultures,”
and Nas lends some vocal dexterity to
“Give It Up Fast.” '

As if rapping about every possible way
to kill a man wasn’t a bit much, the duo
waters down their songs with mundane,
tough—guy choruses. Such is the case on the
otherwise effective “G.O.D. Pt. HI,” which
begins with a macho drive-by skit. Mobb
Deep aren’t terrible MC’s. That is to say,
their deliveries are cool, their voices aren’t
bad, yet criminal paranoia replaces original
thought. “Can’t Get Enough of It” is a prime
example of a typical Mobb song: a crack-
ling record is sampled to give the track an

impressively cruddy bassment feel, yet they ‘

fail to bring the goods with their rhymes.
“Lay on the wall and watch all y’all/ ya’
can’t injure a ninja/ Ya’ crept and took a fall/
Surrounded by crime cats, time for tapped

jaws.” Okay, we know that you’re tough
guys, but so what?

Mobb Deep will never receive the
commercial success of acts such as Bone
Thugs, Coolio or T‘upac, despite the fact that
their production is superior. Sell—out? Never.
Hell on Earth is unquestionably a street
album. The Mobb’s only gimmick lies in
the fact that they are straight—up 100 percent
HARD. Murder, robbery, and misogyny are
just parts of the battleﬁeld. The question
remains whether or not the Mobb possesses
the skills to win the war, as more gifted
groups are armed with clever put-downs
and creative wussie raps suddenly seem
refreshing. Sigh  .

A Minor Forest/Gainer split 7”
(taﬂdng to the) man from lusk/Bastion
Divot Records

A Minor Forest’s Flemish Altruism LP

was so good that I couldn’t wait for the split V

project with Gainer. The infomiation about
this release, which I read about in a Divot
compilation, did not specify the size of the
record. I learned it was a 7” only after my
roommate and I stumbled upon it in Paul’s
CD’s. Considering the amount of time it
took to compile the songs on Flemish
Altruism: constituent parts ‘93- ’96, we may
not see another LP from A Minor Forest for
some time.

But small releases are good too.
“(Talking to the) man from lusk” continues
A Minor Forest’s formula of passivity
mixed with ferocious guitar, drum, and
vocal surprise attacks. However, “man from
lusk” offers more of what’s quiet, starting
and ending with soft, instrumental inter-
ludes. Voice sampling pops up here and
there, adding another dimension to A Minor
Forest’s collage—style song creation.

Gainer’s song, “Bastion,” starts out big
and stays powerful all the way through. The
arrangement is complicated but heavy and
discemable, producing a potent variety of
riffs that reminds me of Drive Like Jehu.
One interesting verse/chorus arrangement
changes quickly from a galloping verse riff
to a pounding, synchronized onslaught of
drums, guitars, and screaming.

This split 7” gives a great sampling of
what these bands have to offer. A Minor
Forest’s Flemish Altruism is a double LP,
and you can hear some more Gainer and
other good bands on the Divot label on the
Ground Rule Double compilation. Write to
them at Divot, PO. Box 14061, Chicago, IL
60614.

THE PITT NEWS

Live;

a lot, and there’s a whole lot more
planned for the future. Take this week
for instance. It’s the Rickety New
Wave Caberet, featuring costumes,
trivia contests, prizes, and some of
Pittsburgh’s rock superstars in dis-
guise as New Wavers. At least half a
dozen acts will pull out_some of the
cheesiest ‘80s c_over songs they can
come up with to edutain our asses
with. -

In addition, local legend Scott
Prarie will be performing his unusu-
al set of emotionally piercing pop
songs. We’re talking about music as
healing in a big way, people, and if

‘you aren’t touched by his songs, then

you just might not be human. Scott is

 

Thursday, January 16, I 997

 

well known for his work in the avant—
noise group 7 Goats, and for his con-
tact—impro.visational work at the
Dance Alloy. The Scott Prarie solo
experience is, in my opinion, the most
effective means of communication for
this introverted, yet outward-looking
performer.

Fans of - spastic aggro PUNK,
The1985—style will be treated to a
special rare performance by that
band’s spin—off project, called Rib
King. Don’t miss this show. Write or
call Rickety Records at 682-1583,
515 Melwood Ave, Pittsburgh, Pa

God For Mental Illness to realize that there
are hands out there with more on their
minds than making a large wad of cash.
‘The Brian Jonestown Massacre digs
straight to the roots, with their sound rang-
ing from Mexican country—and—westem to
acoustic Brit pop. For BJM’s dabbling lis-
teners, this concept may be nothing short of
a nightmare, for evidence from past record-
ings has produced nothing less than the
group’s talent for reconstructing the likes of
My Bloody Valentine and the Stooges into
powerful, hypnotic, psychedelic shoe-gazer
drone.

band’s career had to be addressed:
“It’s funny because our CD
Methadnone isn’t really about that  I

into old American music.”

Take for instance “13.” ‘Tis perhaps the
best Creedence—inﬂuenoed song I’ve heard
coming from a band who I thought knew no
more about music than the fact that Brian
Jones was in the Rolling Stones. Slide gui-

Hazzar ”-like guitar solo —— it’s in there.

California, USA upbringing, he romances in
British tones in “Stars” and “Cause I Love
Her,” coughs up Dylan’s dnmken excuse for
a singing voice in “Ballad,” and imitates
Mick Jagger’s heaiable sneer in “Talk —
Action = Shit.” 

Anti-American shoe-gazers may be
hating this. They may be in total denial that
BJM has even stooped to this “low” level of
American culture. For those “loyal listen-
ers,” they get one 30-minute tribute to the
way it» once was; a smorgasbord of
Spiritualized/Ride/early Pale Saints.

Thank God shows evidence of a true
love of the group’s craft, namely music and
its connection to “r ” listeners; America’s

Enigma
3: Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!
Charisma Records

While Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!,
Enigma’s latest effort, attempts to recapture
the feel of the band’s previous work, it falls
short in many ways.

In 1990, when a song called “Sadness”
broke onto radio stations throughout the
county, Enigma was hailed as an innova-
tive trend setter. Yet, Le Roi Est Mort, Vive
Le Roi! (translated as ‘The King is Dead,
Long Live the King!”), tries to rely too
much on past successes.

Enigma’s work may still. be entertain-
ing, but Michael Cretu (who basically is the

band) seems to be treading water. Enigma
keeps selling albums, but it is mainly due to
the success of “Sadness” and the band’s first
album, MCMXCA.D. '

On MCMXC A.D., Cretu blended

’ Gregorian chants with ambient sounds and

a techno beat. At the time, it was truly an
original work, but in the six years hence, the
band has been followed by similar artists
such as Deep Forest and the “Chant”
albums.

In the meantime, Enigma’s second
album, The Cross of Changes, was released
in 1993 with little fanfare, although the sin-
gle “Retum to Innocence” regained some of
the band’s popularity. With three years
between albums, the group lost much of the

work.

The third album was once again
released three years after the previous one.
However, while the ﬁrst two albums devel-
oped a constant theme, Le Roi Est Mort, is
more of a jumbled conglomeration of
Cretu’s previous works.

This includes the work which Cretu
had done before Enigma. While many of the
albums he released under the name of
“Cretu” were standard dance albums, he did
develop an album called Die Chinesische
Mauer, which was the beginning of evolu-
tion of Enigma.

Die Chinesische Mauer (German for
“The Chinese Wall”) was released in
Germany. Much like Enigma’s work, it
melded two distinctive music styles —— East
Asian music and dance beats.

a distinctive sound and theme, Le Roi Est
Mon merely jumps from point to point.

“Morphing Thru Time” is probably the
best track on the entire album, yet it has the
same feel as a track from the ﬁrst album,
complete with the chants that were made
famous by “Sadness.” The third track,
“Third of a Kind” actually sounds more like
a Deep Forest tune than an Enigma one.
“Almost Full Moon,” meanwhile, has a
Middle Eastern inﬂuence, like The Cross of
Changes.

While the new album maintains the
same soothing trance—like feel of the Cretu’s
previous works, it lacks the focus. It does
not stick with one common theme, which is
what made Enigma’s albums interesting.
Instead, Le Roi Est Mort sounds like a com-
pilation of singles rather than a theme
album.

However, Enigma’s latest release, if
nothing else, is a good introduction to what
the band is capable of doing. A new listener
may enjoy this album, but Enigma fans may
be a bit disappointed by its roundabout qual-
lty.

In addition, Michael Cretu sings a bit
too much on this album. In previous efforts,
his voice was left more to the background
and an occasional lead on a few songs. Le
Roi Est Mort has too much emphasis on his
vocals, instead of the quality instrumenta-
tion that lies undemeath.

As a result, the album is of a better qual-
ity than most ambient—dance efforts that are
out today, but it is still not up to Enigma’s
best. Hopefully, we will not need to wait
another three years before we can determine
if this is an anomaly or a trend.
