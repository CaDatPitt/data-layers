‘ SG Urges Students
To Collect $50 Fee

DR. DOUGLAS THOMPSON, director of the Student Health Service,
addresses the senate Thursday. He explained that the two-fold purpose
of the service is to provide medical care and to educate students about
health measures and health hazards, especially cigarette smoking.

Student Government unanimously passed a resolution
reminding seniors and the Student Account’s Office that
‘each senior-is. entitled to receive» his $50 matriculation,f.ee.-
upon graduation. _ _ _

Every freshman entering the University is required to
pay a $50 matriculation fee which is to be returned‘ upon
graduation or withdrawal. _

The SC. resolution said: “Accord1ng to present proce-
dures, the University neither reminds the senior about his
deposit nor does it refund the money without a personal
request.”

It went on to say that “since
many students forget about this

By JACK! KATZ
Major student activity fund changes were

- announced by Lawrence L. Monnett, vice-

chancellor of business affairs, as a result of
Student Government requests earlier this
year. Speaking at a Student Affairs Commit-
tee meeting Thursday afternoon, Monnett
also squelched rumors concerning the budget
and Chancellor Litchﬁeld.

In response to an SG request that students be
given a. ten per cent discount on purchases in the
Book Center, ,Monnett outlined a proﬁt sharing plan
whereby the Student Activities budget wopld re-
ceive 50 per cent of the Book Center proﬁts.

“This year the proﬁts will probably be small
since this is the ﬁrst year the Book Center is oper-
ating on a proﬁt,” commented John Vrana, SG
president. “Next year profits should be higher. There
could be as much as $10,000 returned to us.”

The Book Center has never shown a proﬁt since
it moved from the basement of the Cathedral to its
present location in February and March of 1960 due
to maintenance and other costs. This is the ﬁrst
year they hope to be operating in the black.

The money received from this plan will be used
as. a discount or for student activities, depending
upon the decision of the Student Affairs Appropria-
tion Committee. It will be in addition to the present
‘Student Affairs allocation and will be earmarked
for activities.

In addition to the Book Center discount, SG also
asked that the ﬁve per cent -sales tax on textbooks-
be removed. Monnett explained that he has no‘ con-
trol, over the sales tax, but that he has been asking

to‘ lobby in Harrisburg for the removal of theltax.

In explaining the various rumontthat have been  I S‘

circulating, Monnett said: “We are not going broke.
We have never failed to meet any debt payments.”
The University has a $42 million debt, and “while
it is substantial, it is on revenue-producing property ~
such as the dormitories.” The University debt ﬁg-
ures are published as are all university debts.
“The cutbacks are due mainly to the fact that.
we are roughly one year out of phase,” Monnett.
continued, “and we are trying to cut this gap)’
When the ten year plan was ﬁrst started, a tuition

increase was contemplated for 1960. This was. not 
included due to an economic depression in the Pitts- A

burgh area effected by the steel mills.

“This cut $1.5 million that they were counting
on,” Monnett said. “This year.we hope the cut-
backs will bring us back where we should be.”

Monnett also explained that Chancellor Litch-
field is not going to be Ambassador "to Panama
nor is he going to be Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare. “He is staying right here. You couldn't
blast him out of this place.”

Monnett explained that the SG recommendation
that the proﬁts from the Identiﬁcation Cards be

turned over to the Student  budget will be 

granted. This will add approximately $2,500 to the

Student Affairs budget, and the money will be used

as appropriations for student organizations, _

also discussed.» A fee of $5 per trimesterewouldadd  -- '

$90,000-$95,000 per year to the Student,Aﬂ?airs allo-

"The bill urged all seniors to
request the money and asked the
University to assume its obliga-
tion to remind seniors to claim
their deposits when they are bill-
ed for their graduation fee.

President Pro-Tempore of the
Senate Jerry» Hogan estimated
that since the average graduat-
ing class is comprised of 1,500
students, as ‘much as $75,000
could be involved, if all students
asked for a refund of their ma-
triculation fees.

Dr. Douglass Thompson, direc-
tor of the Student Health Serv-
ice, addressed the senate at
Thursday night's meeting. He ex-
plained that the Service has two
major functions: the ﬁrst, to pro-
vide “good clinical medical care”
24 hours a day; the second to edu-
cate students about health meas-
ures.

Dr. Thompson hoped that dur-
ing a student’s stay at the Uni-
versity he might learn to deal
with certain repetitive illnesses.
A further aspect of the education-
al service is to warn students of
health hazards, in particular ci-
garette smoking,

When the possibility of a Uni-
versity inﬁrmary was raised, Dr.
Thompson pointed out that they
are usually ineffective and ex-
tremely expensive.

In an effort to cut toll charges, outside lines are no
longer available from restricted University extension tele-
phones. Local calls (now have to be placed through a Uni-
versity operator and long distance calls can only be made
from phones with a special “Q” number.

It was disclosed that toll calls have been made on Uni-

these calls have been untrace-
able and according to David
Brewer, director of purchasing
and office services, the phone
bills were “higher than we hoped
they were going to be.”

The Special “Q” numbers have
been assigned to the various
deans, who may distribute them
to their departments. When a
caller attempts to make a long
distance call through a Univer-
sity operator, he will be asked
for his “Q” number. Calls may
then be traced back and charged
to the department or project
which made them. '

The changes were instituted on
Jan. 16 for the Museum num-
bers and on Jan. 22 for the May-

continued, that part-time help on

With over ' 100 Air Force

in ‘ ' Academy cadets forced to re-

sign‘ ‘over questions of aca-
demic integrity, the issue of
cheating continues to con-

. cern the University commun-

ity. The faculty and the ad-
ministration at the University
feel that the problem does exist
here, but only in isolated cases.

Nearly all those interviewed
agreed that a uniform policy for
dealing with cheating infractions,
which would be made public to
students and which would be
strictly enforced by the faculty,

I  is needed at the University.

At present the official hand-
book of University policies and
regulations for undergraduate
students states that in cases of
academic dishonesty “disciplin-
.ary action is taken by the aca-
demic dean concerned in consul-

’ tation with the instructor and in

some cases with the Dean of Stu-
dents.”

, While the handbook goes on to
deﬁne cheating, it does not state

- what kind of disciplinary action

is taken by the dean in cheating
cases.

The following comments typify
the divergent views expressed by

I ' the 20 faculty and administration

members interviewed.
> What kind of experiences

have you had with cheating in

your classroom?

—Bliss Cartwright, graduate

, assistant in the Department of

Philosophy:
I have had two deﬁnite cases.
One was a graduating senior who

- said he could not be present for

a ﬁnal exam. He turned in a
take home ﬁnal that I immedi-
ately recognized as being plagia-
rized. .

The other case was not as clear

‘cut. In an exam, I received a

blue book that was worth a “B”
from a very poor student. I
checked and found the material
was the same as that written by
the person sitting next to him.
—-Dr. Jerome‘ L. Rosenberg,
professor of chemistry:

T'.., ,._._...,._....1 1' A..,.1 4.1_l .. .,..L:-..
a... 5..---.. _.- - -...._ ..-.._, .>-q.-...c..,;.,..

is fairly well under control. The
cases where I have discovered
cheating are really isolated. I
don’t deny there is some we

 

BLISS CARTVVRIGHT

haven’t caught.

Some University students feel
that looking at test from past
years is cheating. I don’t see this
as dishonest. I think its legiti-
mate.

—Dr. Robert G. Colodny, asso-
ciate professor of history:

None. The nature of my as-

signments doesn't permit cheat-
ing. Cheating is literally impos-
sible because the examinations
are based on individual insight
which can’t be crammed for.
- You encourage cheating if the
student feels the work is busy
work, The size -of the class is no
excuse for cheating. Multiple
choice exams should be outlawed.
They’re a’ fraud. It is impossible
to cheat on a properly composed
set of essay questions, particular-
ly if the emphasis is put on the
~ quality of argument and think-
ing. _

> How did you deal with
cheating infractions?

—Dr. Colodny: I warn stu-
dents in advance that plagiarism
is self-defeating. ,

Dr. Rosenberg: I have report-
ed them to the dean of the school
in which the student was en-
rolled and let the dean take the
disciplinary action.

Cartwright: I failed the stu-
dent who had plagiarized the
take home ﬁnal. It is unfortun-
ate; it went down on his record
as simply an academic “F” and
not as an “F” for dishonesty,

In the other case I questioned

HELEN POOL RUSH

the two students and they ad-
mitted they had studied together.
I had them take the test over
and the poor student knew noth-
ing.

—Anonymous member of fac-
ulty: Are you asking me what I
would do or what I'm supposed
to do.

> Where do you see the solu-
tion to the problem of cheating
coming from? -

—Dr. Rosenberg: I prefer to
rely on the honesty of my stu-
dents. I frankly would hate to
see students locked in avroom by
themselves with a proctor stand-
ing over them.

—Dr. Colodny:. The teacher
must set an example of intellec-
tual integrity that his students
will be inspired to live up to.

_—Cartwright: There are pecu-
liar problems in a commuter
school. An honor system works
better in a residential college.
My preference is that some sort
of honor system should be tried.
There is nothing. to lose and
much to gain.

—Dr. William B. Crafts, dean
of men: ~

A consistent policy of punish-
ment for various degrees of aca-
demic dishonesty implemented
by the faculty is needed. In this
way Professor X would deal with
the same infraction in the same
way as Professor Y would deal
with it.

Helen Pool Rush, dean of stu-
dents: ‘ '

 

DR. ROBERT COLODNY

I would-prefer to depend on a
body of public opinion that holds
people to high standards. As a
person matures he must hold up
his own values even when he is
in an impresonal situation.

One University official:

The faculty just shouldn’t.close
their eyes. They should watch
for wandering eyes in exams.
Moreover they should produce
such a high level of teaching
that it would seem sacreligious
to the student to cheat.

The administration can help
with the problem of cheating by
making the University a more
human institution by keeping
classes at a reasonable size.

—Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice-
chancellor for Student and Gen-
eral Affairs:

Deﬁnite standards should be
set by the faculty. The primary
responsibility rests with the fac-
ulty member in his classroom.
Exams can be proctored. Examina-
tion dishonesty could be largely
eliminated by proper supervision.

     Cheating ExistsHere, But 1. Isolated

By BARRY SHAW i ,
PlM Series. presented vio-
linest Allen Hood in the Sup-
per Room Thursday. At best,
he was mediocre, and at
worst, he was terrible.
Hood began with the Han-
del Sonata in D Major, a
light work demanding only an
adherence to its melodies and a
clean tone. Hood performed this
work adequately, giving a straight-
forward performance without
many mistakes.

During the second piece, how-
ever, Brahms’ “Sonata in A Ma-
jor,” communications began to
break down between Hood and
his accompanist, Anthony DiVit-
torio. The Allegro of this work
contains one of Brahms’ most
soulful melodies, and requires a
complete integration ‘ of violinist
and accompanist. Because the
two musicians seemed to be play-
ing separately, the music really
suffered. It was in this piece
too, that Hood’s_ actual poor play-
ing began to show through.-

It was after intermission
though, that the concert really
deteriorated. Hood chose to play
three works by Paganini, presum-
ably to show that he was as much
of a showman as that great vio-
linist. Unfortunately he was not.
Racing up and down the violin, a
necessary quality for Paganini,
Hood not only was sharp and
ﬂat, but squeaky and droning all
at once. The violin either "reson-
ated or sounded like a whining
cat during these pieces.

The concert closed with a
Bloch Sonata that sounded main-
ly like a tuning up.

puter design, display techniques, propagation, or human engineer-

ing. You may analyze. You may synthesize. You may deal with ‘

systems or individual components. At the highest levels, you may
have to consider political, economic and social factors . . . as well as
the available and predictable technology.

would permit the exceptional student to _grad-

e Sphinx

 By ancy Delaney‘

And Billy Budd was hung.

The captain wrung his
hands and sobbed. But Billy
Budd was hung. The sun
shone and the sky was blue
and the sterile purity of the
law waspreserved. And Billy
Budd was hung.

The drop was ﬁfteen feet
and his neck snapped, and
they all said, “I’m sorry Bil-
 ly Budd, but

0%

   
  

. . because “the
Mlssnelaney Sphinx de-
mands, and we do -not know
the answer to the riddle.” It
was easier to sacriﬁce Billy
than to ﬁnd the answer.
It- was easier to reify
an abstraction and kneel be-
fore it than to grasp the rid-
dle by the shoulders and

S : ‘ shake it and scream “no, no.

.\i

 

You may foil us and trip us
and scoff at us, but we will
be human. It is all we have
—to be human—and we will
build our world with it.” It
was easier because to be hu-
man is also to be weak, and
to be hurt. But the riddle
of life is iron: strong, insen-
sitive. And it is easier to
play the game of the Shinx
than to be human and to be
hurt.

Yes,_ the game is easier——

. But we must refuse to play.

We cannot be committed to

the Law; we cannot be com- ‘__

      

not be committed to Princi-
ple or to Cause. For we must
be committed toman, not to
the institutions. Man creates
his institutions to serve him,
not to master him; to trans-
cend the Sphinx, not to emu-
late it. ‘

Yet man molds his protec-
tors into gods as demanding
as the Sphinx itself. He con-
tinues to sacriﬁce his blood
to them, shutting off his
heart and crying, “If I don't
obey them, they weaken; and
their death would leave me
alone to confront the Sphinx
his terrifying Riddle.”

BUT IT IS not really the
demise of a protector, nor
theterror of the Sphinx’ that
causes man to shut off his
heart. Instead, it is his own
cowardice to accept the aw-
ful responsibility that ac-
crues to a master and escapes
a servant. He is afraid to
be human—and to be hurt.
A universal principle relieves
him of the responsibility for
the decision that this man
dies and that man doesn't.

Under a ﬂat universal,
Billy Budds die, but the cap-

tain’s hands are clean. The
captain stands on the fore-
castle—or sits in a dean's
office—with the flag of Law
and Virtue waving over his
head. He does not reach for
the starched handkerchief
in pocket, for he grasps the
Navy Regulations. or the
Student Handbook, in both
hands; and his innocent
tears trickle down ‘his chin.

But we must judge. For
our commitment lies with
man, not with his institu-
tions. We cannot moralize
that “one exception sets a
precedent,” then sip our tea
and take a nap. We must be
willing to say yes to the.
ﬁrst man and not the sec-
ond, and then say, “I am

responsible‘ for this judg- ‘

ment.” For we are not tired

old men weary of feeling and -

afraid of being human. I am
twenty and I am empassion-
ed and I am human. The
Sphinx may jeer, but I will
not play his game. And if
God is god and his way is
really the way of the Sphinx
then I am thankful I am
man—-and I can hang with
Billy Budd.

Cheating Story

0
Questioned
Editor, The -. Pitt News:

As members of the teaching
staff here, we have a few ques-
tions and comments on Fred
Frank’s second article on cheat-
ing. First, what is this secret
code encapsuled in the staples of
the blue books? Perhaps one of
Mr. Frank’s interviewees, wear-
ing, we suppose, a stocking over
his (her?) head, could interpret
it for us.

Second, what reforms would
his interviewees suggest the fac-
ulty initiate? (Since it's all their
fault.) An increase in the num-
ber, and cleverness, of proctors
would strain university funds,
and, worse, be “very bad psycho-
logically for the cheaters.”

Teachers could prepare a sep-
arate exam for each student in
the course and check ﬁngerprints

_ at the door, but this would result

only in complaints of arbitrari-
ness and messy ﬁngers. Again,
teachers might charge a ﬂat rate
of $20 for a C in ﬁnals, thus sav-
ing the nuisance of grading an-

other test, and eliminating the

middleman.

We can promise that at the of-
fer of as little as $10 for opening
the supply cabinet of our depart-
ment, not only will our eyes light
up but our ears will turn red as
well and we will break into song.
Unfortunately, our supply cabi-
net contains nothing but manila

envelopes and thousands of gum

bands.

Finally, it is embarrassing to
report that in three and a half
terms of teaching neither of us
has been approached by a stu-
dent of the opposite sex looking
for help with grades. We don't
guarantee compromising our in-
tegrity, but give it try, girls.

tages such as the opporttmity to
complete a life's basic education
in two and two-thirds years and
the long summer period. It is for
these deﬁnite advantages alone
that the trimester should be
admired.

I do not agree with his reform

Defense of
Prof Studied

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to question, A in
brief, one of the motivating prem-
ises in the defense of the un-
known professor (“Two Students
Defend Prof.” The Pitt N ews,
Jan 15, .a letter defending a pro-
fessor who was attacked in a pre-
vious letter).

I am not familiar with the course
or the professor and have only
an interest in free critical analy-
sis" and discussion at heart. You
see, if we accept the dictum of
messieurs Anderson and Landau
we are then required to slavishly
accept the authority of any pro-
fessor or any hypothesis that is
placed before us..

I maintain’ that neither are
sacred cows to be blindly follow-

‘ ed and adored: the mark of the

intelligent student is his ability
to objectively analyse and judge
a situation, personal or academ-
ic, for its quality, value, and
validity. Sherry Lazar

ON CE" MORE UNTO THE BREACH

Today I begin my eleventh year of writing this column in your
campus newspaper.

I wasn’t sure I’d be coming back this year. After a decade of
doing this column, I had retreated to my country seat, tired but
happy, to enjoy a nice long rest-. But last night as I sat on my
verandah, peaceful and serene, humming the largo from A Long
Day’s Night and worming my dog, a stranger suddenly appeared
before me. ' ’

He_was a tall, clean-limbed man, crinkly-eyed and crooked-

' grinned, stalwart and Virile. “How do you do,” he said. “My
name is Stalwart Virile and I am with the Personna Stainless
Steel Razor Blade people.”

“Enchanted,” I said. “Take off your homburg and sit down.”
I clapped my hands sharply. “Norman!” I called. “Another chair
for Mr. Virile!”

  

      

sag)“,
“Another chairfor Mr. I’ zrile!”

 

Obediently my dog trot-ted away and returned directly with a
fanback chair of Malayan rattan. He is the smartest dog in our
block. .

“I suppose you’re wondering why I am here,” said Mr. Virile,
seating himself.

“Well, sir,” I replied, n1y old eyes twinkling roguishly, “I’ll
wager you didn’t come to read my meter.”

You can imagine how we howled at that one!

“That’s a doozy!” cried Mr. V irile, ﬁnally catching his breath.
“I must remember to tell it to Alice when I get home.” ‘

“Your wife?” I said.

“My father,” he said.

“Oh,” I said.

“But enough of wit and humor,” he said. “Let us get down to I
business. How would you like to write ‘a campus column for
Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades?” I

“For money?” I said.’

“Yes,” he said.

“My hand, sir,” I said and clasped his. Warmly he returned
the pressure, and soft smiles played upon our lips, and our eyes ,
were moist with the hint of tears, and we were silent, not trust-
ing ourselves to speak. I

“What will you write-about in your campus column?” asked
Mr. Virile when he was able to talk again.

“I will take up the burning issues that vex the American un-
dergraduate!” I cried, bounding to my feet. “I will explore, With-
out fear or favor, such explosive questions as ‘Are roommates
sanitary?’ and ‘Should proctors be given a saliva test?’ and
‘Should capital punishment for pledges be abolished?’ and ‘Can
a student of 19 ﬁnd happiness with an economics professor of 80?”’
_ “And will you also say a pleasant word from time to time about
Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades?” asked Mr. Virile.

“Sir,” I said simply, “what other kind of word except pleasant
could I possibly say about Personna Blades, which give me more

‘ luxury shaves than Beep-Beep or any other blade I might name?”

“Another of my products is Burma Shave,” said Mr. Virile.
“Can you find it in your heart to mention Burma Shave occa-
sionally?”

“But of course!” I declared. “For is not Burma Shave the
whisker-wiltingest lather in the land?”

“Yes,” he admitted. B

And then he shook my hand again and smiled bravely and
was gone—a tall silhouette moving ercctly into the setting sun.
“Farewell, good tonsorialist!” I cried after him. “Aloha!”

And turned with a will to my typewriter.

‘ Saturday was Rex Peery

{day at _-Fitzgerald Field
 House, and the wrestling
 ‘team made it a winning
J day, defeating Maryland,
214-13. The victory was

Peery’s 113th career win here, .

V and was his last home appear-

ance as wrestling coach.

  Although Peery does not re-
V tire until March, the matmen
- took the _meet as a ﬁnale for
' . the coach, taking several key
. performances to win their
_ ﬁrst meet of the season.

‘ Toni Liberati came into the

 130-pound match at 125
 pounds, getting a a disputed

draw with Maryland's Milt

_ Thomas. Liberati did not know

he was going to wrestle until

. - ﬁve hours before the meet,
when Mike Johnson failed to

make the weight for 130-
pound match.

Thomas held a 4-3 edge
when the third period ended,
but Peery claimed Liberati
had riding .time, giving him
the point necessary for a draw.
Although Maryland coach
“Sully” Krouse waddled

I around the timekeeper’s table

for ﬁve minutes claiming
“someone tampered with the
clock,” referree Lynn Kling
declared the riding time point
valid.

Amidst the ensuing furor,
Dino Boni handily defeated
Kent Webster, 6-3, giving the
matmen an 8-2 margin going
into the key 147-pound match.

“This one tells," said Peery
as Frank O’Korn approached
the mat. “If he wins this one
we'll have the match.” O’Korn
and Nelson Aurand battled for
two periods, with a 2-2 score.
However, at 2:12 of the third
period, O’Korn made an es-
cape and then a take down,
defeating Aurand and giving
the matmen an 11-5 lead.

But the victory was not se-
cure, with four remaining up-
per weight matches remaining.
The matmen had only won
three of 12 upper weight
matches prior to the meet,
and Maryland has had their
best men in those divisions,.
according to Peery.

Lee Hall, however, won his
third match of the year, de-
feating Maryland's sophomore

  Tracksters Conquer

  Slippery Rock, 48-38

By RON SHEARER
The Panther track team defeated Slippery. Rock
Saturday, 48-38, in a meet coach Carl Rees termed the

worst‘ organization he had ever seen.

“If there hadn't been any spectators, we wouldn‘t have been
able to have any judges,” said Rees. “Besides the lack of offi-
cials,” continued Rees, “we were disqualiﬁed in the mile on a
technicality which I had never heard of, and which they could
not prove since they had no rule book at the meet.” The tech-
nicality which Rees referred to was his last minute insertion of
Bill DelVecchio in the mile relay in place of Fred Poellnitz when

S S "the ﬁrst two legs were run poorly.

The Panthers won the meet with a good showing of depth
by placing several men in most events. Jim Flanigan won the
shot put, and Hangosky took second with the best effort of his
career. Damien Koch won the mile run, while Frank Handelman
ﬁnished third. Bill DelVecchio won the 600-yard run and Luddy
Hayden won the hurdles, with Dick Crout and Paul Lambert tak-
ing third places in the respective events. In a similar ﬁnish as
with the meet against Kent State, John Bailey and Dave Eichen-

hub won the two mile run.

Coach Rees was disappointed with some of the perform-
ances, but he was not disheartened. “Slippery Rock has a
track which is similar to asphalt, and no one was allowed to

_ ’ wear spikes. Naturally, using sneakers hurt our performances
_ and slowed our boys down considerably,” said Rees. Fortunately,
the track team will not run on the same type of surface again

' , this year.

Cagers Play Westminster;

Split on Weekend Road Trip

With only enough time to unpack then
pack their bags, the Panther basketball
‘team travels to New Wilmington, Pa., to
tangle with the Westminister Titans to-

- night. This will be the ﬁrst game of the

home and home series the teams plays from
now on.

Westminister has an 8-5 record after defeating
Carnegie Tech Saturday night, 74-63. Westminister
shoots accurately. They shot 53 per cent against
Tech and were led in scoring by Bob Oravetz, who
had 28 points.

‘The Panthers defeated the Titans both games
last year, but expect more difficulty tonight. This
past weekend the Panthers were both hot and cold
and split their two away games.

After leading all the way on Friday ‘night the
Panthers survived a second-half rally by Massa-
chusetts to down the Redmen 89-74. The Red-
men pulled the score to 65-60 but defensive hust-
ling on the part of Brian Fisher and Jim LaValley
and clutch shooting by Larry Szykowny and Daryle
Ruby surged the Panthers on and widened the
margin.

The winners shot 50 per cent from the ﬁeld,
the best they have_shot this season. Leading the
shooters was Szykowny who poured in 24 points
and Ruby who hit for 21. La_Valley and Fisher
both had their high totals for the season as they
contributed 13 points apiece.

On Saturday’ in Hanover, Massachusetts, the
Panthers found it harder to score, and 'lost to

Dartmouth, so-70, Only 36 per cent of the Pan-
ther’s tries went through the‘ hoop while Dart-
mouth hit for 51 per cent.

Ruby_ and Szykowny did. lose their ability to‘

shoot, however, contributing 20 and 18 points
respectively. Ruby hit on short jump shots,’ but
the defense couldn't stop Dartmouth from scor-
ing on. lay ups and short pumpers.

The win gave Dartmouth a’ 3-11 record to the
Panthers 4-10. The oddsmaker and coach Tim-
mons ﬁgured the Panthers to have a rougher time
with Massachusetts than with Darmouth, because
of the records. The Panthers, however, split the
games the other way.

Swimmers Lose Fourth Straight

Panther swimmers lost their
fourth straight dual meet to Mi-

. ami of Ohio, 62-33, last Saturday

at Miami, but the score 'doesn’t
indicate the closeness of the con-
test.

The swimming team shook Mi-
ami at the start by winning the
seven-point 400-yard Medley Re-
lay and the 50-yard Free Style
but the Ohioans, aided by three
close races, ﬁnished the meet
with victories in the ﬁnal four
events.

In the 200 - yard Backstroke,
Russ Lindberg, placing third,
missed ﬁrst place by less than
a body length to Miami’s two
strokers. Second -place ﬁnisher

yard Breaststroke. in— the closest

Lindberg and Anderson along

_ with Gary Martin and Tim Ribar-

chak comprised the winning re-
lay team. Martin also swam and
won the 200-yard Butterﬂy event,
the second of four Panther firsts.

Andy James earned the other
two honors by repeating his Ohio
U. performance. He won the 50
and 100-yard Free Style swims
and again anchored the losing
Free Style relay team.

By FRANK SMIZIK

Brian Fisher’s value to the basketball team can be un-
derstood if you think of him as a defensive out ﬁelder re-
placing a big slugger. Fisher’s quickness enables him to steal
the ball and play defense, but he’s only as good a scorer as

a .220 hitter.
“I know I can score better than I have shown so far,”
said Fisher, “but I’m hurrying my shots too
much. In the West Virginia game "last week
I had a clear jump shot from about eight or
nine feet and I missed it because I hurried it when
_I saw those big men coming at me.” A .
In high school Fisherplayed the same way. He 
would steal the ball then go down court ahead of
everybody, and miss the lay-up. He did score a lot
though, .and. he made ’ All-City while at Peabody
High School here in Pittsburgh. 3.
Although he isa senior, this is the ﬁrst year for.  _. 
Fisher on the. varsity. After playing freshmen_ball
he played on the now eliminated junior varsity for
two years. He never made any trips with the varsity
and dressed only for home games. '

Fisher, two year letter winner in baseball,
doesn’t have a basketball scholarship, yet he still
gives up his time to play varsity basketball. “I just
wanted to play and I knew I could play varsity if
‘I gotthe chance.” _

Panther coach Bob Timmons still isn’t sure if ‘
Fisher belongs in the line-up. At the beginning oi /.2; .
the year Stan Falenski was strating at guard, but FISHER
he couldn't do the job, so Timmons went with Fish- Asset to Team
er. In the Bucknell game Roth '
McNally showed he could score
so Fisher was again on the bench.

At the end of December in the ‘

Quaker City Tournament the - ’ , v
Panthers couldn’t bring the ball    g   . . .
up court against a full court
press. Fisher was home with the

. measles. Timmons then knew he.
had to start Fisher again. Fisher
started. the West Virginia game
in Morgantown, but Timmons
used forward Dave Blyshak at
the guard position in that game
and he scored 17 points.

At Army Blyshak couldn't score
and---had trouble with the press 
the Cadets used so Fisher again
played and this time he scored
ten points in the second half.

Timmons still isn’t sure if Fish-
er will start. Roth McNally has
recovered from a knee injury,
and he showed he could score
again in the West Virginia game. ‘

 

FEBRUARY, 4 - 5 -,6

 

Timmons summed up Fisher’s
value to the team when he said,
“Brian has the experience that
the other guards don't have and 
he is a good dribbler and can  _. _   _ ,,,,,,,, H V,
 the  up court for us. " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. -
I know he can score but he hasn’t ‘
shown it so far, and we need
scoring in the lineup.”
