 With last Saturday’s record to our
credit we should have no trouble in
maintaining our side of the cheering
endﬁand, a little bit more.

Last ,week University spirit pre-
vailed all through the Ooakland dis-
trict, especially was it shown before
and after the game on Saturday. A
parade of Pitt students and alumni
through the downtown streets pre-
ceded the game. Headed by thePitt
band and the Gold and Blue routers,

Ifrom Union Station to Liberty avenue,
to Smithﬁeld street, to Fifth avenue
and;-thence to the ﬁeld of battle, their
strident yells reverberating between
the tall buildings. At the head of the
parade the Dents led a mule decked
in the colors of its alma mater, to
whose tail was tied the colors Of 
& J." dragging behind in the dust.
Fifteen hundred noise makers, donated
by the Dusenberry Baking Co., were
in evidence. -

A few minutes after Pitt’s adher-_
ents arrived at ,the park the voices of
3000 students and alumni rooters
boomed up witlrits Allegenee genac-
genac, led by the big noise maker
Scott Conway. “Witchi co-ax, co-ax,
co-ax,” was the echo heard from the
W. & J. camp which was stationed on
the opposite side of the ﬁeld.

A ﬂying spray of ribbons, paper
streamers, pennants and hats would
rise occasionally from one part or
another of the visiting crowd, as 3
result of a particularly brilliant ﬂash

of course predominated. Silk-hatted

enthusiasm .as_.the noisiest. freshmen,
in the student -cheering’ ‘section. — The’
alumni had their cheer leaders, too,
and almost as muchvrooting came from
the two graduate grandstands as from
the undergraduate bleachers.

After the game the Pitt and W. .&
J. students accompanied by the fair
sex to the Nixon theater, more than
howled in an effort to prove ‘just which
of the twO- institutions could lay claim
to the strongest lungs in the universe.
Pitt, after losing the foot ball game,
had the consolation of winning the
George, M. Cohan trophy, the judges
declaring that the voices of those
wearing the ‘Gold and Blue were just
a wee bit more powerful than those
from Little Washington. John Drew,
in a few well-chosen remarks, ex-
pressed his sympathy ‘ to‘ the losers
and handed the emblem to the already
hoarse cheerleader Scott Conway.

The handsome Roberts cup for the
winner of the contest at Forbes ﬁeld
was presented to Captain Cruikshank.

{Hats off to the scrappiest‘ and nervi-g
est bunch of ‘football players on earth!
Pitt has good reason to be proud of
its team’s showing last ‘ Saturday.
There were some».errors, of course;
but they were all ‘errors of the head,
and the hands, and the feet. There
was absolutely no fumbling by the
backbone. . _  * 

' Germany's fleet, is still‘ bottled’ up,
according to latest‘ advices from Lon-
don. Germany’s ﬂeet is entitled ‘to
Spiegel’s sympathy. ‘_ .. 

Speaking of Spiegel reminds us that
we now know the answer to the ques-
tion of -whether it was Fleming who».
made Spiegel, or Spiegel whomade
Fleming. _All the eviden,ce'last'.Satur-
day was in_ favor of the titian-haired
halfback. As soon as “Red’s” engine
began to miss a few, his sidekick was
throughfor the day.  A .. ' '

In-‘another column we ‘present the
Graduate Mana‘ge__r’s protest against
'1;h‘e use of student tickets by outsiders.
No protest could be more timely. At
the present‘ rate, itwill soon be “When
is a student not a student?  When he

fhas a studentathletic book.”

 We call attention to ,the mildest

thing that has come out of Washing- ‘
ton county in years-—-and best of all,
this "is from the Washington’ Reporter,

If we ever entered a kick against‘
the ,Varsity line, we takejpleasure in
retracting it’ right here. “ No matter?
how bad they may‘ look tomorrow_or
some other. day, we can’t wholly for-
get the Liege stuff they pulled last

resumption,  full, of. athletic ,rela-'

ball teams ‘reppresentingthe two rivals
have met only three. times in‘ the‘ past, .
in 1908,‘ 1909‘ and 1910. ‘Pitt was,re-
turned the victor in all three games,
although the one in 190_9‘was' won. by
a score of only-6'to 0." After the 1910?
game relations ‘were broken off and
for two years no’ contests of . any sort
were held between the two. Now, how-
