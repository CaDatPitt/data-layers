Dormitories in Total Darkness

To M alce Transformer Change

The darkness enveloping the
University dormitories from mid-
night to 7 a.m. last Monday was
to permit a change-over in the
transformer systems, according

to James L. Sahlin, manager of
Schenley Park Apartments Com-

jE,.{-pany.

“New transformers have to be
installed to handle power in the
Schenley area now that the new
men’s dorms are nearing ‘com-
pletion,” said Sahlin. , f‘While
the old transformers; are «being

 

    
  

must be installed.” Early Mon-
day morning, the lines were
transferred from the old to the
temporary transformers.

On June 10 the -current will
again be turned off from mid-
night to 7 a.m. to switch from the
temporary transformers to the
new transformers.’ They will be
located in a vault beneath, the
driveway of the new dorms, and

Self-service photocopiers have N

faculty members and students.

The ducostat machines repro-

The price for each copy ob-

11 inches.

Other departments of the li-

Physicist Urges Science Plan
For Underdeveloped Nations

A staff member of the Institute
of Theoretical Physics and of the
Institute of Sociology in Lund,
Sweden, insisted on- Monday at
Langley Hall that an analysis of
the relationship between science
and the underdeveloped countries
is essential to the formulation of
government policy.

- Stevan Dedijer is visiting this
country as a guest of the Depart-

vment of History of Science and

Medicine at Yale.

.Dedijer said that the problem

was one of the relationship be-
tween. scientiﬁc research and cul-
ture. The problem is of general
interest even though the scien-
tiﬁc revolution is being carried by
a minority of nations.
Should They?
_ For the “underdeveloped” coun-

tries, the question is, should they

develop research? “They must
start with the minimum political

~ changes necessary for the eco-

nomic development necessary for
research,” Dedijer said. Countries
need a cultural‘ revolution if they

‘ are to raise the standard of ‘liv-

mg.

“The development of a plan-
ned seientiﬁc-research policy is
essential to general national
development,” he continued.
But in th e underdeveloped
country, one must know what
"social force is necessary to in-
troduce research into the cul-
ture. In the industrialized na-
tion, there ls a demand‘ by in-
dustry on scientiﬁc research and
a. demand by the scientiﬁc com-

munity itself on research.

In the underdeveloped country
these forces are not present. Thus,
the government must acquire the
tools to stimulate the research.

Jones will devote himself to

“I look to the future’ with an-
ticipation of teaching,” Westin

Besides the recipients of the

Above Proﬁt or Loss

Editors Steer University ~ Press

Toward One Goal: Scholarship

By THOMAS PLATE

“The value of a university
press is-not measured in terms
of profit and loss,” explained
Fred Hetzel, associate editor
of the University of Pitts-
burgh Press. “A commercial
press is obligated to its stock-
holders. We are obligated to scho-
larship only.”

Agnes Starrett, the editor of the
University Press, added, “The
Press is committed to extending
learning beyond the classroom in-
to the world, and to the publica-

. tion of scholarly journals.”

The Press publishes the scholar-
ly journal Ethnology, edited by
Professor George Murdock, The
History of Education ‘Quarterly,
and plans to print American

Philosophical Quarterly, to be- ;
edited by Professor Nicholas Res-A _

cher. .

The Fiction of J. D. Salinger,
by Gwynn and Blotner, is the
Press’ top bestseller, tallying 13,-
000 sales.

But the Press was not found- ‘

ed on the rationale of sales.
Rather, the publishing arm of
the University originated with
the need to publish books con-
cerned W i th regional history.
One of the first of the twelve
regional books was Agnes Star-
rett’s Through One Hundred
and Fifty Years in 1937. Since
then the Press was published
about 15 to 20 books yearly.’

“Although we get many poten-
tial books from people’ ‘we’ve
never heard of, most of the manu-
scripts come from scholars, about
half from this University and half
from othersin the United States,’.’

said . Fred Hetzel. “It-' takes four I

or_ five months to process one
book.”

it takes so long to get from manu-

“After wereceive’ the manu-

proach a book with any degree of
seriousness when you are fore-
warned that it is . going to" be
humorously satirical.

What? No Pictures?

1 You also keep wondering, “So
; where the hell -are the pictures?
It’s got his name on it._ It’s written

like he-‘writes. So, where are the
(pictures? That’s ridiculous ——
Feiﬁer without, pictures.” And

this feeling never leaves during

the entire book. It gives the im-

,. pression of being only half a
book.‘The writing is so undeniably
Feilfer, that after you realize that
there aren't supposed to be any
pictures, you feel a little cheated.

Jules Feiffer would find it
very difficult to say anything
A important the way he writes.
You never know when he is
kidding or when he is serious.
He is funny sometimes, often,
in fact, butl suspect that where
he has meant to make an utter-
ly serious comment on. modern.
society, he has failed because
the reader was not prepared for
j-_ anything utterly serious.

By STAN STEIN‘

Jules Feiffer’s first novel, Harry, The Rat With Women, reads, not like a novel
should,‘ but more like one of his comic strips withoutthe pictures. The writing style is
the same, with or without the speech bubbles, and this, forimany reasons, is unfortunate.

For one thing, you have to go no farther than the ﬁrst couple of pages and you say
to yourself,-“This-is going to be a satire.” Very matter-of-factly; Just, “This is going to be
a satire.” Not that there is anything wrong with satire,‘ but it is very difficult to ‘ap-

through his early ‘twen/tiesvand

‘thirties is beauty ‘personiﬁed; He
is irresistible to women, as‘ well

as. men. In his later life he is
ugliness personiﬁed.Il-Iis ugliness
is the consequence of, his early
vanity.
Unlike Most

The trouble is that few people
are-, really either of these, and,
if they are, fewer think of them-

.selves that way. Feiffer is not
portraying universal man, he is-

picturing the exception. The read-‘
er, therefore, can never‘ become
involved with Harry, or any of
the characters for that matter,
and must remain an outsider.-

H Certainly there are characters
portrayed of whom the reader
will occasionally say, “Sure, I
know a person who is like that
— -sort of.” But in the main,
Feiﬁer’s characters are three-
ﬁngered -cartoon people, two-
dimensional and colorless.

In a sense, Harry’s vanity is
justifiable, though vanity is what
Feiffer decries‘ throughout the
book. Harry not only thinks that
he is beautiful, he is "beautiful,
and there is a diﬁerence between
the person who thinks he is beau-

tiful and isn’t and the person who

knows that “he is.

. During an interview last
week, Jerry Whalen, director of
men’s housing, casually re-
marked to a reporter from The
Pitt News that visiting students
)night mark up the blank, white
wall on the F01‘bes Street en-
trance to the new dormatories
but not the “mature students of

Pitt.”
I’m reasonably s u r e that
Whalen intended the comment

to be taken with a grain of salt,
but there is more truth in what
he said about student action
than would generally be be-
lieved. .

It’s not that University of
Pittsburgh students are more
mature than any others; it’s just
that no one on this campus has
"ever done such a thing and
probably Nouldn’t know how to

go about marking up a wall in
the accepted collegiate fashion ,

even if he_ wanted to.
Usually, Proud
Usually, I would be proud of
this obvious display of maturity
on the part of our students;

however, maturity has absolute-

ly nothing to do with it. The
truth of the matter is that Pitt

students just don’t give a good-

hot—damn about anything --
much less splattering paint on
a dormitory wall.

Students at this institution are
for the most part, dull:-time

ing on campus during the Spring
Term (students living at home
do not enter into the discussion

because their dullness is not a.

University sponsored function),
it is slightly more ‘than ‘quite
impossible to expect any bright-
ening of the situation.

The Rabble Returns

Of course, things usually pick
up in September when the rab-
ble rousers return for another
year of useless demonstrating
against Convocation -speakers’
and President, Kennedy, but
what ‘are we poor summer stu-
dents to do until then?

Excitement, it has ‘been said, .

however, is there for them that
has the determination to root it
out and, chunkie, I got that de-
termination and what’s better
yet, I’m willingto share the re-
sults of my ﬁndings with you.
Now don’t go getting all sorts
of excited. Put away your tennis
sneakers and hang up your glad-
rags. I’m not quite ready to start
dishing" up the goodies yet. This
is only an introduction. The real
divulging begins in a week or
so, so sit back and relax and
watch for the ﬁrst installment
of Summer Excitement in Pitts-
burgh or'Sunburn Spotlights in
this space soon.

Defense Department Hoax

False Security

“For the 192 U. S. cities of 100,000 people or
more, the Soviets could deliver about nine mega-
tons per 100,000 city people, allowing for a 30%
failure of delivery systems. This is an overkill of
160 times.” (Seymour Melman,
Saturday Review, May 4, 1963,
page 11.)

The people of the United

States are faced with-an im-
mediate problem: survival.
0 In the May 8, 1963 issue of
The Pitt News, concerned citi-
zens, read the Defense Depart-
ments answer to the possible
explosion or nine nuclear mega-
tons on 100,000 city people:
fall,-out shelters, some on the
ground level.

The Defense Department evidently thinks that
in the event of an atomic attack, ‘the city of
Pittsburgh and periphery is. indanger of fall—out,
which “results from a bomb explosion sufﬁciently
far enough away that there has been no appre-
ciable effects from blast or thermal radiation.”

What in the world are fall-out shelters useful
for? Does the Defense Department actually think
that Pittsburgh and outlying areas, with vital
steel and industrial capacity, would not be a prime
target for ‘a multimegaton bomb? _ ~

‘The Department would, it follows, pass out
aspirins and bathing suits to citizens in danger of
a ﬂood. ‘

It would advise its citizens that in the event
of a fire, dress lightly to ‘avoid overheating.

The reality of . its answer is this: fall-out

‘shelters are about as useful to citizens threatened

with nuclear annihilation as a band-aid is to a
hemophiliac. ‘
The Real Danger . _ .

Thereality of the danger is this: “Defense
methods of everyconceivable sort can be satur-
ated and overwhelmed by the variety and quality
of offensive weapons.” (Saturday Review, ibid.)

The truth is that fall-out shelters are not only
useless butithey are pernicious to clear and logical
thinking: they‘ lull the citizens into a false sense
of» security. In short, they are a hoax.’

But even _the basic assumption to fall—out

 

By Thomas Plate

shelters, or any shelter system, is more dangerous

_ than any answer to that assumption: unlike rain,

snow, death, life, love, hate, breathing and taxes,
devastating nuclear attacks are not inevitable.
There is noinevitability to missiles armed with
nuclear weapons," poised for overkill.
If the dam is leaking, you do not pass out
bathing caps; you ﬁx the leak in the dam. ‘
If a fire is raging, you don’t run into‘ the brick
cellar and hide like a mole; you put out the ﬁre.
If nuclear annihilation is waiting, you don’t
hide from it like an ostrich sticking his head
under ground; you destroy the danger by taking
the missiles oﬁ the launching pad and leaving
them off. -
No Logical Response
‘ But does the concerned citizen get this logical

response‘ from the Defense Department? No, all

he gets is a namby-pamby, “close your eyes, place

your hands over your head,” and hope the‘ bomb -.

doesn’t fall on you‘. ’
Fortunately,_ there is still some intelligent,

“unafraid, and responsible citizenry left: the‘ 14

faculty and staff members who sent a letter to
President Kennedy and other oﬁicials. The peti-
tion calls for the government to continue to pur-
sue an effective test ban treaty. ' .
This is logical. The -group headed by David
Halliday, dean of the natural sciences, and Francis
S. Cheever, dean of the School of Medicine, de-

‘serve the support of every student in this Uni-L ‘

versity. I support them; I applaud their deep
concern with admiration for their sense of duty.
as ‘citizens;

The letter says that a treaty would (1) ‘appre-
ciably '_curtail the ‘spread of nuclear weapons to
additional nations; (2) slow the development of
a weapons system already having “overkill”
capacity; .(3) transferwa good chunk of" the 51%
of ‘ our "government budget to non-destructive
areas; (4) reduce radioactive fall-out. (this is
much better than hiding in the. Cathedral until

the 14-day supply "of food runs out);"and (5) pro- ‘

vide a vital precedent for the rational solution of
other international problems. . " 
These 14 faculty and staffmemibers are in-
telligent citizens. Their approach to the problem
is imminently more logical than the Defense De-
partment’s and its subsidiary agencies.

‘I am really surprised that the

have enough strength, totempt
the interest of the student body

whether they seriously think
about this problem or, whether
they. are’ satisﬁed with today’s
condition. I heard some students
declare that there exists al-
.most no racial discrimination

those accustomed to a bad smell
can no longer smell it.

I’d like to tell you my very
small experience. Just after I
arrived here I went to church
with an American family. On
the way to church the wife told
me that we would hear a beau-
tiful solo in the choir. He is a
Negro, she added, but he has a
nice voice. "As soon as she used
the word “Negro,” her husband
corrected it to “colored.” At that
time I felt that even here there
exists racial discrimination as
they had to be so sensitive to
the word “Negro.”

I guess many students were
upset when this problem was
brought onto the campus be-
cause they know. it must be
solved as soon as possible, and
they were afraid that if they
took a place in the movement
they might lose their _white
friends, or accrue some disad-
vantage in the future. Perhaps
that is why so many passed by
the petition booths. Maybe it

avoid it. The chancellor‘ won’t
support this movement that stu-
dents complacently refuse to

pride. as the editor of one of
America’s great student news-
papers? _

I believe that universities
should. owe a great responsi-
bility to the society in which
they exist, but also to,truth it-
self. 'Univers'ities must not fail
to stand for truth.‘ If they won’t,
who will?

Toichi Aoyagi

Number one, Mr. Aoyagi, the

example "of discrimindtion you »

with the '— University of Pitts-

Number two, if we ‘may dis-

eering, and others, however,
feel that they are “pressing hard
for fourteen weeks.” Neverthe-
less, they would not sacriﬁce
ﬁnals’ week in order to gain an
extra week of class time.

The advantages they attribute
to the present system are that it
allows time for comprehensive
tests and gives the student a per-
iod in which to integrate his
knowledge of the course matrial.

A two-hour ﬁnal is “completely

ance.”

Dr. Crouch favors the present
system because without the.time,

Invitation Tomorrow

Jim Sylvis of Roger Johnson will pitch today for the
Panther baseball team against Duquesne at Leech Farm.
The Panthers stopped the Dukes the first time they met this
year, 6-0, as John Carlisle pitched a no-hitter.

The Panthers may be more worried about the NCAA
bids, which come out tomorrow, than the outcome of the

game today.

There are four berths in sec-

The winner of the Metropolitan
League (New York City) gets an
automatic berth, as does the win-
ner of the Middle Atlantic Con-
ference. There are two at-large
berths.

Four Being Considered
“I don’t have any idea what
our chances are for going to the

“playoffs,” Lewis said. “There are
(four teams that are being consid-

ered; Ithaca, Long Island Uni-
versity, Penn State, and us.

“Ithaca always has a strong
baseball team, and Long Island
University is strong also, but I
don’t know their records.

‘‘All I know is, we’re about as
close to perfection as we can get,”
Lewis said. “We’ve only lost one
game.” 1

Three Unbeaten Pitchers

“We’ve been working towards
the tournament all year,” Lewis

’ continued. “If we go to the tour-

nament, I have three or even four
pitchers that I can start.” John

If Duquesne expects to win to-

Cuthbert has 31 hits in 64 at

Ricciuti is batting .443, Maiurek

John Ciotfi and Paul Martha

Kent State has lost "twelve

Track Team to Meet Ohio U;
Hope to End Over .500 Mark

By FRANK SIVIIZIK

The Panther track team has
a decisive dual meet Saturday
with Ohio‘ University at
Athens, Ohio. If the Panthers
win, they williﬁnish with a
winning record. Their loss to
Navy last Saturday gave them a
3-3 mark for the season.

Coach Carl Rees made several
changes in his lineup against
Navy, but it did not make much
difference. Vance Carter“won the
880—yard run,‘ but Mike. Slutsky
couldn’t fill the space he left in
the 440-yard race. Slutsky could
only manage a third.

John Bailey switched» from the
two mile to the mile and ‘took
ﬁrst place, but no other Panther

could place. The same was true"

of the two-mile in which Larry
Robinson took a" ﬁrst. Robinson
had been‘ running the mile, but
had not been» very ‘successful.
Friend Second ‘Twice

Joe Friend met his most for-
midable opposition of the year
and fared fairly well.’ He took a
second in the 120-yard. hurdles
and the broad jump, andthird
in the 4.40-yard hurdles‘. Al-
though his performances in the
120-yard high hurdles and broad
jump were impressive, he’ ran
way off his usual time in the 440-
yard intermediate hurdles. '

Jack Whiteford, a Panther stal-

wart in the high jump and in the
hurdles, ‘could not score _any points
against the Midshipmen.

/_,Penn State Foe

‘For Winless
Cat Net Squad

By FRED BERLIN

The loser of the Pitt-Penn
State tennis match Saturday
could complete a perfect _ sea-
son. Itiwill be a! rather dubi-
ous distinction,,however, and
an unwelcome one. In their
total starts to date neither team
has posted a victory.

Last /Thursday Carnegie Tech
proved its local supremacy. The
Tartans, who held an earlier win
over Duquesne, defeated the
Panthers 7-2. Dave O’Lough1in
and Roger Glaser won the ﬁrst
/two -matches for the Panthers as

i ‘ Tech swept the remainder.

On Saturday, bad weather
forced the cancellation of the
West Virginia meet. The Mounties
had posted an 8-1 victory ea_rlier
this season. No plans have been
made to reschedule the rained out
contest.

Lions iWon Last Year

Although Penn State won only
three meets in 1962, they were

 able to get past the. Panthers.
‘ This year State coach, Sherman

Fogg, now in his seventeenth
year as mentor, has ﬁelded a
young squad. There are no seniors
in the starting lineup.

With A] Isaacman and Steve
Seitchik as the only ‘returning’
lettermen, the Lions have ex-
perienced a great deal of dif-'
ficulty. _The upcoming encount-
er will provide_ special incen-
tive for Jeff Bickmore. The six

1 foot sophomore netter is a na-.
tive Pittsburgher and_ graduate
of Peabody highschool.

Panther coach Ben Pope hopes
that next season will prove to be
a better one. He’ said, “We’re
looking for help from our fresh-
men. We need a greater ‘amount
of competition within" the school
and more interest.”

Following’ the Penn State match '
_V,(.,only Allegheny remains ‘on "the

‘ schedule. The contest will be ‘the

ﬁnal for seniors David -O’Loughlin.

and Roger7Gl’aser. Allegheny did
not appear against the Panthers
last season. '

The tennis teams record is now

Back to Original Position

Versatile John Cioffi
Plays Three Positions

John Ciofﬁ has played three positions for the baseball
team in the past threeyears. He came here as a second base-

=man, but has since played right ﬁeld and first base. - Only

recently has he been switched to his ‘original position.

. Ciofﬁ adapted well to his

outﬁeld position his ﬁrst year,

according to Coach Bobby Lewis. Ciofﬁ explained the ease

with which he accepted the shift.
“Outﬁelders can be made in a
day,” he explained. “Any man
with two legs. and a glove can
catch a fly ball.”

In his junior year, Cioﬁi was
shifted to ﬁrst base. “He played
so well at ﬁrst that he made me
look like a magician,” Lewis said.
Cioffi accepted this praise modest-
ly. “First base is the easiest posi-
tion to play,”ihe said. “There is
very little thinking to do.”

Second-Base Harder

“Playing second base is a lot
harder than ﬁrst,” -he continued.
“There is a lot ‘morejthinking -to
do. At ﬁrst base there are only
a few things to watch for. You al-
ways ‘have to look for the bunt,
and sometimes you have to worry
about keeping the runner close if
you think there might’ be a steal
or a hit-and-run.

“’l‘here is a lot more thinking
to do at second base,” Cioﬂi
said. “For one thing, you have
-to watch for th steal and hit-
and-run V more closely. On a
double play, you always have to
let the pitcher know ahead of
time who is going to cover the
:_.ag..”

Lewis has been satisﬁed with
Cioﬂi’s play at second thus far.
“Hejhasn’t made any errors, and
on the double play ’we manage to
getjthel head man. Ciofﬁ can go
anywhere E and doia good jo .’_’

Lewis explained that although
Ron Supansic, the regular second
baseman, who became ineligible,
covered more ground than Cioiﬁ,
the’ other inﬁelders would not
overshift to favor Cioffi. _

Ciofﬁ, however, admitted that

I” shortstop Al Riccuiti d o e s
“cheat” a bit when a runner on
ﬁrst base -is a threat to steal.
“Al usually plays one to two
steps closer to the bag when
there’s a man on ﬁrst. That way,
he makes the tag on a steal.”

\. Without Supansic, the baseball

team loses a lot on the double

play, according to "Lewis. “But,”
he concluded, ~ “Cioﬁi. will be all
right.” '
