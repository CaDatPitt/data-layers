Shapp’s Budget May Cause Tuition Increase I 

by JOHN POULIN

Dark clouds gathered over Oak-
land last Tuesday as Governor
Sliapp called for a financial freeze
on Pitt in his "streamlined bud-
get" proposed for fiscal year
1973-74. While the Governor turn-
ed his back on rising inflationary
costs and the costs of new pro-
grams. stunned University offi-
cials cringed with thoughts of pro-
gram cuts and a possible tuition
increase next fall.

The Governor's proposed budget
will.hold state funds to Pitt at
$45.5 million. Last year. the state
boosted appropriations to the Uni-
versity by more than 10 per cent.
All three of the Commonwealth‘
colleges (Pitt. Penn State. and
Temple) have had their funds froz-
en for the coming year. The‘ only

segments of higher education to ‘

get budget increases were the
county community colleges.

In justifying his freeze the Gov-

ernor said, “Enrollments are
stabilizing and operating costs
should reflect this.” In an inter;
view with the Pitt News Friday,
Vice—Chancellor Arlon Elser, direc-
tor of Pitt’s Planning and Budget-'
ing, considered this reasoning
much too shallow.

Elser said. "Inflation is going
up—it's going to cost us more to
heat our buildings. and .wage and
salary costs are going to incrase
at least moderately." Elser said
that an “overall increase of’ five
per cent «$2.3 million)" in the
state appropriation would be
needed to actually stagnate the
school's budget. "In addition." he
said. "there are new education
programs which should be tund-
ed."

The task which Shapp has laid
before the University is to "elim-
inate some of their costs without
reducing" the quality of educa-
tion.“ Although Shapp supposes
some savings in more "efficient

United F/arm  Worl<ers Need Support

operation." it appears inevitable_
that some substantial cutbacks
will be in order or a tuition in-
crease next fall. '

As to cut backs, said Elser, “I
can’t prejudge it at this stage.~It’s
premature to talk about cuts per-
say-—what is called for is an as-
sessment of our priorities.” There
are 20 different schools within
the University, and an extensive
evaluation involving conferences
with the deans of these schools is
underway.

When asked about the likelihood
of a tuition increase next fall. El-

ser replied. "lt‘s
uated: we realize it's near the
ceiling already ~ that's a bare

bones fact of life. The student is
paying about all he can bare.

/But.“ he added. "the uitivei.-s~ii_\~

has been holding the line on tui-
tion. we haven‘t had a tuition in-
—crease in the last two years.

Elser explained that the budget

.1l.JFWSeeks Stronger Lettuce Boycott

“x

by LARRY PANSIN/0

The Pittsburgh officeof the na-
tionwide Boycott of Non-L'nion
Lettuce has been trying to convince
local consumers — most notably
by picketing A&P super markets-
to buy only lettuce harvested by
by members of the United Farm
Workers tUFWi,Union. Only 10 to
14 per cent of California and Ari-
zona lettuce is picked by UFW
laborers: the purpose of the boy-
cott is -to force all of the growers
to negotiate contracts with the
union.

The boycott‘ organization has
picketed A&P because of the store
chain's large volume purchasing
of non-union ‘lettuce. As the big-
gest chain store in the world. A&P
buys four million heads of lettuce
each week. The boycott feels that
coast-to-coast economic pressure
on A&P from a successful boycott
will force the growers to accept"
the union.

' “Every supermarket chain in
the city sells non-union lettuce,”
said a representative of the Pitts-
brugh boycott. “Only the Oakland
Co-op deals exclusively in union
lettuce.
what they can get, and most of
it isn’t picked by the UFW.”

‘E Szabo Food Service. the Univer-

I’, sity's catering service for dormi-

tories and lunch shops. has re-
cently agreed to buy union lettuce.
Associate Food Director Robert
Henner said. "We use union let-
Ktuce almost exclusively and will
continue to/ do so as long as the
price difference remains relative-
ly small. Right now. union lettuce
is only 25c to 50c more per case.”
Renner said that he as ap-
proached by representatives ot
the boycott about three weeks
ago and complied with their re-
quests because of the "worth-
- wliilenature of the cause."  ' '

Undergraduate Academic Review

Professors Veto Power

by KAREN BURGIO _ ‘

Proposals for the revision of the
veto power of.professors rated" in
the Undergraduate Academic He-
view were discussed at Fridays
noon meeting of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council.

In two; separate proposals. Hon
Eskin and John Capitman of the
College of Arts and Sciences Cabi-
net suggested replacing the veto
power of a course evaluation. now
held by course ‘_instructors and
professors. with an explanatory
power. allowing the instructor to
explain why he felt the course suc-
ceeded or failed. or why the
course evaluation is inaccurate.

Eskin proposed that instructors
could choose not to be reviewed,
or not to explain why they dis-
agreed with the evaluation. Capit-
man proposed that all courses,
recitations and labs be review-
ed, but allowing the instructor
four options: accept the evalua-
tion and have it published, accept

the evaluation and have it pub-

\ .

lished with a personal commet or
rebuttal, reject the evaluation and,
in its place publish a statement of
why the “evaluation is invalid,-or
reject the evaluation, not p,u_blish .
aCrebu,ttal,\ but have it‘ bei_‘noted;

'lish the evaluation. '

Currently. professors and in-
structors choose whether they
will allow ‘the course to be eval-
uated by students. They may veto
the evaluation. it they feel it is
inaccurate. -but cannot publish a
rebuttal or comment on the eval-
uation.

Professors at the meeting‘ coin-
plained that the (AH. as currently
set up. does not help the instruc-
tor. for the information is not al-
ways useful to him. Eskin and
Capitm_an said that students do
not always place credibility in
the Lndergraduate Academic ite-
yicw. because instructors can
chose to have the course eval-
uated. or can refuse to allow the
ex aluation to be published.

Dr. Jonathan Harris of the Po-
litical Science Department ex-
plained why he felt the UAR did
not publish “fair” evaluation, as
currently setup:

“I have been teaching a course’
for the past five years, and final-
ly hit what I felt the course should\
achieve, being more coherent,

,more informative and requiring-

more work onthe part of the stu-

 
 
 
 

state freezé. but also from a shut"-
fling of federal funds. He pointed
out that the federaldbudget pro-
posed by President Nixon will re-
direct a sizeable portion of feder-
al aid to higher-education in the
form of "interest-free loans." The
effects of this havebeen some-
what disasterous. Elser said that
the health professions at Pitt were
particularly _ hard with funds
to the Graduate School of Public
Health "cutback 40 per cent."
Support to the School of Education
' was c__ut in a likewise manner. And

Another boycott worker said,
“The political process there (in
California) is ugly and corrupt.
The growers control the cops and
the judges and treat the workers
as commodities. The union treats
them like human beings.”

Besides the A&P picket lines.
the Pittsbkgh Boycotts "educa-
tional effort" involves spreading

the news of their cause to as many

consumers as possible. Ch\avez.
head of the UFW. will be in the

The goals of the \'F\\' for the
workers is improve wages and es-
tablish numerous fringe beiietits
such as credit unions. clinics. re-
tirement farms. insurance. legal
aid. counseling. and an economic
development fund.

Statistics released by the Sen-
ate Subcommittee on Migrant La-
bor reflect the conditions of the
lettuce workers. Of the three mil-
lion. farm workers in 1971, one-
third of the total is migrant work-
ers, 300,000 of them being chil-
dren under 14 years of age.

"The average migrant family
has 6.2 members. 2.3 of. whom.
work and earn $2.020 a year.“ the
statistics read. "Nine per cent of

’ them receive public assistance."

Two-thirds of all farm workers
are not covered by the minimum
wage law and 75 per cent of all
workers below federal poverty
levels. They received less than
half the national industrial aver-
age wage in 1971. earning an aver-
age hourly wage of $1.73.

The average’ migrant family
lives in 1.9 rooms: among mi-
grant homes. 18 per cent have no
electricity. 90 per cent no running
water.-and 96 per cent no bath tub
or shower. "In California. four out
of five farm workers families live
in housing so substandard it is
dangerous to health and safety."

my roommate and I choose to indulge.
l'hings were already tight. and promised to get
tighter. School began to look like a lu.\'ury. I would

seek employment. There wasnt any.

There was employment, in a general way, but
none for me. Before _returning to school, I had
been a technician. It would be nice, or“ at least
bearable, to return to that sort of work, at least
for a while. No way. ’

When I admitted to being in m_\ Juitior year.
interviews ended abruptly. Nobody wants an em-
ployee who will rush back to school as soon as
he can. .\'obody believed I would not do just
that. tThey were right.» '

It would be difficult ll not impossible to cott-
ceal my student status; a gap of several years
Ill a work history requires a lot of explaiiiitig.
Damned if you do. . . ’

Obviously. jobs which required a degree could
not be considered. There was very little left. atid
that little would pay even less than the net trom
veferan’s benefits. _

All told. I was netting about $300. per month
from the \'.A. and occassioiial employment. After

taxes. I would have less than that left from $400.

per motitli. -But nobody had offered me eveti that
much. Minimum wage work comes to a lot less
than \'.A. assistance.

This is what they sometimes call a dilemma.

However, one solution did suggestitself. The
Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency
existed to help students, through grant and loan
programs. H

Fine. I got the papers for PHEAA. filled them
out. gotall the necessary endorsements aitd atti-
davits. signed them in all the right places. last
name first where appropriate. got them back to
the right office and sighed with hope and reliel.

The whole thing took part of an evening and one

‘technicality. for

alternoon ol scurrying around. It it worked it
was worth it.

It worked. After what seemed a rentarka.ble short
delay for a bureaucracy. a caiiary _vellow envelope
came to my house. A form inside. likewise in a
cheery _vellow tdo they use gray to notify losers.‘ I.
announced that the loan had been approved;
take this to your bank.

The bank had also been notified. Twenty niiti—

young woman handed me a Cashier‘s Check tor
what looked like a lot of money. It was made

breathe. All along I‘d been waiting lot‘ some
something to go wrong. It had
not. I had the check. I would pay my tuition

as a veterani. I would go to the bookstore. I
would return a library book and pay the fine. I

were endless. I could hold my head high. I
could look my cat in the eye.

‘But first I had to return to the university. Its
name was on the check too; we both had to en-
dorse it. The work of a moment.

Not so. ‘First. there was a long line at the
cashier's counter. Predictable. Only one cashier
on duty. Predictable. Someone having a long
discussion with her. Predictable. I waited. Noth-
ing would spoil the day. Got there at last.

Food, Worms
and Health

Dear Editor:

I am writing to yoti about
food. worms. and health. An un-
usual combination indeed. or at
least I thought so until Friday.
l*‘ebruary El. . I was sitting down
to eat what I expected to be a
good meal at the Presbyterian
Hospital Cafeteria of. the Uni-

. versity Health Center consisting

ol among other items a fillet of
fish. Lo and behold. but as I
put my fork into it. I saw a
worm! It was a yellow. round
worm of about-an inch. My only
consolation was at least it was
not half of a worm.

Well. I took my plate. worm.
lish. and all and asked to speak
to the manager of this line. cale-
teria. which in addition to feed-
ing students. employees. and
men and women of the medical
profession also sends its delicacies
to all of the patients who he in
their hospital beds. Lpon speak-
ing to the person who I was in-
i'tii‘iiied was in charge. I came away
in a state of disbelief. Mr. Chiel
Dietician informed me that
was aware of the worms in the

lisli. not only in the tish now‘

being served. but in the fish when

_.! it was originally purchased. In-
quiring further. I was told that

the worms were guaranteed to be
of a harmless species and there-
lore he chose to serve them. By
this time I was wondering whether
maybe I was getting a good
deal». .-\fter all. look "at all the

tures whichl had studied about
in my invertebrate biology course
as an undergraduate. Maybe. the
fact that the worms were present
was why the fish was being serv-
ed to all of us undernourished
medical students on such poor

diets of hamburgers and cokes— ‘

to give us extra protein! .In fact.
provided they were not on pro-
tein-free diets. just think of how
this added dose of proteins
would help all the_patients in
the hospital.

.\Ir. Dietician was a very po-
lite man. He even gave me my
meal on the house. that is to say
he returned my money. L'ntor-
tunately. however. I really did
not feel like eating any more loud
even if it, would aid my ailing
health. Having found staples and
hairs in my food before. I guess
I should not have been concern-
ed by such a natural thing as a
worm. But my pastlack olCpro-
teins really bothered me. so I
placed a call to a group of peo-
ple who I'm sure are also always
concern_ed about good health. 'llie

the. food inspection division who
was an investigator. He agreed
with me that my report was a
bit surprising atid seemed concern-
ed indeed.

The Health Department promis-
ed to conduct an investigation into
why I should find worms in my
food and they promised to get in
touch with me. I told the III-
vestigator that I really would
not have’ complained if the menu

I TransyIvanI°an—born Historian Explains

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

A black coffin set the stage
for a lecture Thursday night en-
titled "In Search of Dracula."
The lights down. except for two.
pale red and glowing from the
back corners of the SU Ballroom.
combined with the dischordant
organ music to-set the mood.

When almost all had filled the
seats in the ballroom. lined the
sides and overflowed into the
Kurtzman room awaiting the lec-
ture and movie. a voice rang
out. "We need absolute silence.
please.“ _

Once this was attained a small
spotlight illuminated the front
of the room and the coffin slowly
opened as Dracula emerged,
resplendent in slicked down hair
and spreading cape. ’

It was a rather novel introduc-
tion for the speaker. Radu Flor-
escu. a Transylvanian born. Ox-
ford educated historian who found
Dracula‘s castle in 1969 and co-
authored In Search of Dracula.

Florescu explained that the be-
ginning of the Dracula myth in
American culture was a_result of
an original novel by Franz Stoker
entitled Dracula published in
America in 1899. _

The novel. "translated in every
language but Romanian has never
been out of print in America."
Florescu said. I

“Stoker did something‘ illegi-
timate in the novel,” Florescu
said. “He married two concepts;
the misdeeds of a rathernasty
prince of Romania. Vlad the Im-
paler, with the story of Prince
Dracula of Transylvania.”

"Back home (in Transylvania)
in school I was taught that Dra-
cula was a national hero. But in
the West. Dracula has assumed a

much different reputation."

Florescu. a professor at Boston
College. is now teaching a course
on the "Age of Dracula. thestudy
of a fascinating personality who
defended the line of Christiandom
against the Ottoman Turks."

The course. Florescu says. is
taught "logically enough in the
night school of the college."

The invention of the printing
press coincides with the early
folk tales about Dracula, Florescu
said. “Dracula tales were best-
sellers of their time.”

Forescu’s" co-author of«In Search
of Dracula Raymond McNally,
“stumbled across stories written
in 1490 by monks,” Florescu
said. “We suspect they were the
first diplomatic reports of
Dracula.”

Russian. German and Roman-
ian folklore all possessed similar
tales about the life of Dracula.

Florescu said "Romanian was
a spoken lauguage. not written.
until the 18th century. There is
no way Romanians could have

related to the Russians or Ger— »

mans to get the tales."

Some of the reviews of In Search
of Dracula by Florescu and Mc-
Nally have not been favorable.
Florescu said, “Our critics in the
New York Times have said this is
all based upon folklore. This
is_ not true.”

“This is the first polemical ap-
proach to the story in which we
have researched the pros and

' COIIS.

"Dracula research implied not
only the study of Russian and
German history but also Dracula

archives. The study implied the

collective research of historians.
some of which have been hunt-

ing Dracula since 1922.“ Florescu
stated.

The problem Florescu said is
that "we are dealing with two
different Draculas. two different
approachesf'

The Dracula character brought
to life by Stoker is a combina-
tion of two men and the culmin-
ation of misdeeds done by both.
Vlad the Impaler, prince of
Romania received his name from
his nasty habit of impaling thou-
sands of ‘ criminals or prisoners
at one time, usually feasting be-
neath the impaled when it was

9 done, Florescu said.

The real prince Dracula of
Transylvania was no saint either
according to history. Born in
1431 he came to the thrown in
1476 and ruled for six years.

'Florescu said.

Prince Dracula was profiled
in the short movie based on his
book_as a ruler concerned wi_th
the problem of the large num-
bers of poor in the area. Invit-
ing all the poor to a lavish feast
in the castle he then set fire to
the room. killing all inside.

Since finding the castle by
methods of historical comparison
of places existing in all three
languages translations, .Florescu
has found himself and the book in
the middle of the press clamor
about legitimacy of the claim of
being a" historian and not a
money grubber. -

“I‘m still basically a historian
and a scholar in spite of things
that have been said about me-
like I’m a direct"descendent of
Dracula.“ Florescu explained.

A second book on Dracula.
“Not as scholarly and for the
public" is to follow In Search of
Dracula.

Florescu has also put together,
a Dracula tour for Pan Am Air-

lines flights to Bulgaria’, starting-

this March as “a way of emers-
ing oneself in the 15th Century.”

A short film of the same title
as the book followed his lecture

experiences with the point of view
that you don't always have to like
being home 24 hours a day and you
might want to do something else
with your life besides having a
nice family.

about self-defense. Would you
like to comment on the impor-
tance of self-defense for women‘?

Cassandra: I got interested in
self-defense immediately when I
came to Oakland. It got to the
point where I had been hassled by

people. a ,lot of my friends had“

been hassled. some of them raped.
So. I took a self-defense course.

hassled me and not feel afraid.

News: You're obviously involv-
ed in a new kind of social move-
ment. How do you relate to that‘?
Do you feel like rebels?

Cassandra: I think feminism is
basically-misunderstood in Amer-

very personal. I’ve come come to

notice, lately, that everything I 

do raises eyebrows. Yet, I’m just- ,
living my life. I’m just doing what I

I think’s right for me and‘every- .-

son that raises hell. I think that’s.

what feminism is, living what I
am.

Kathleen: I feel I'm not as radi-

call as I was two or three years’

ago. The society we have is going

to be here for awhile. It's probably‘ .. -

better to work out specific things
that need changing instead of hav-

ing‘a big revolution and putting g,  in
something ghastly in its place. I '
think part of it involves equal pro- 5

tection laws for men. I think the

peak of radicalism in the women‘_s.~.1,’N.' "

1970. I think we have to live with, «  ;

men and with this society.

 Operatic ‘Risorgimento’

I   Verdi Rarity Breathes New Life

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor _
Operatic rarities are almost
certain to attract audiences coin-
»-posed of both knowledgable and
._ ‘ignorant listeners. The former
 , breed attends out of loye fora lit-
 tie’; known work while the latter
 group is usually present due to
'_ "pure curiosity.
Most of us. however. who at-
~ tended the Pittsburgh Opera pre-
. miere of \/'erdi‘s~Nabucco this
*.past week must admit ourselves
. to be of the latter group and it is
: with good reason that we make
this confession.

 
  
  
   
 

Seldom performed today,’ .\'a-
. bucco was only the third of Verdi’s
7 operas and his first great success.
;, -Taking as its theme the Babyloni-
L. ; Fan captivity of the Hebrews during

_  ~. the reign of Nebachandnezzar, the
  opera’s libretto soon become the
, symbol of a free Italy during the
 early years‘of the Italian “risor-

"'1 gimento.” ’ *

 

g. , -Nabuc.c0’s rarity‘ stems from its
"demands and its overall qtiality
"~t'”-las an aesthetic masterpiece. 'l‘he
st chorallforces employed are large’
and some of.the special effects
it are tricky to stage. In addition’ to
. I these facts. it must be noted that
.. this work is not a full fledged mas-

 

 

terpiece. II_ is Verdi. but not Verdi
at his best

The action dos not flow as it
does in later Verdi operas: great
musical moments are interspers-
ed with mediocre arias and other
such “filler." Even the orchestra
produces the type of music one
might associate with an ltaliaii
marching band. Most of the clior-
uses are in unison; perhaps the
young composer was almost
afraid to’ attempt part writing at
this time. '

Nonetheless, Nabucco has many
redeeming quaIities,- a fact which
was often demonstrated by some
of the participants in‘ the Pitts-
burgh production. Soprano Rachel
Mathes literally stole the show as
Abigaille, the supposed daughter
of Nabucco. Her wonderfuly de-
veloped dramatic style shone
forth in the many florid coloratura
arias which Verdi wrote for her
role.

Both Thomas Tipton as Nabucco
and Justino Diaz as Zaccaria were
off to a muddy start in one act but
this problem was remedied later
in the opera. Both vocalists were
hardly at their best throughout
the evening‘ but they provided dra-
ma although they both often stood
in Miss Mathes‘ shadow during
the course of the action.

An honorable mention goes to
the opera chorus which was aug-
mented for the occasion. While
much‘ of their work was in uni-
son, they delivered a sense of
large scale drama to the entire
production. Their interpretation of
the very famous “Va, pensiero”
chorus was especially well done.

Costumes and scenery Ill. the
production were very often dis-
appointing or outlaiidisli. .\abuc-
co's entrance during act one in a
costume which very closely re-
seinbled the (fhrysler Building
was‘ a highpoint in Pittsburgh
kitsch. One rather tires of seeing
stairs in every scene ot an opera.

but the set designer for this pro- -

diiction'evidently did not.
The Hanging Garden scenes
were devoid of hanging gardens

tDid ‘the king forget to water his,

plants‘.’i andtthe climactic mo-
ments"were very anti—climac.tic:
that lightning never did quite
knock .\'abucco's crown from his
head and that rather LlIl(I€l‘llt)Ul‘-_
islied statute of Baal in the final
scene never did tall and break into
thousands of pieces. Ah. well.
perhaps we were to iniagiite these
eyents.

For all its inadequacies. how-
eyei‘. this production was an iii-
teresting atteinp_t. Dr. . Karp
"stuck out his neck" in regard to
this production and we are happy
to announce that the guillotine
was not required after all. Pitts-
burgh's Nabucco, in addition to
providing pleasui:e for the listen-
er. gave many of us an early fore-
taste of the greater things which
were yet to come as a result of

 /Vlusic Depi. Developing  

Eihnomusico/ogy Study

by ROB OBENREDER '

The Music Department is devel-
oping‘ a Ph.D. program in rjtlino-
mtisicology. the study of music in
relation to culture.

Slated to begin next fall. the
program will openwitli an em-
phasis on .-\fi‘ic‘an and Alro-.-Xiner—
ican music. '

V"lithnomusicology is an integ-
gral part oi graduate study" in mu-
sic. but has often beenfconsidered
as a completely separate iield."

. sltiwsoii said. Slawson explained

that the skill of taking non—\-Vest-
ern music. of “developing a‘ good
ear.” and the exposure to other
forms of"musical traditioiis in the
study of ethnomusicology are in-
valuable additions to music study.

He also said musical historians
hadmuch to gain from experience

' in this field. By learning toistudy‘

diff-erent types of music from the
point of view of the people involv-
ed. historians would gain new in-
sights into the reasons for music-
al dey elopment.

The Music Department is cur-
rently seeking an associate pro-

ifessor to ‘chair the new program.

Until one is found, Nathan Davis
and Victor Grauer will serve as
interim directors. Fela Sowanda,
a professor associated with the
Black Studies Department, is also
being sought for the program.
Davis. a professional musician
and professor of music at the Uni-
versity. is very interested in the
program. "Most enthi1on1usicolo—
gists are anthropologists who
know little music. With this pro-

gram. we can train musicians to
balance the situation.” Having
musicians in a field so concerned
with cultural music seems to be
an important criteria tor the de-
partment.

Davis said that altlioiigti the
course will consider only Alrican
and Afro-AAmei'ican music at the
outset. other ethnic groups will be
included as the program develops..
“In an urban situation such as
Pittsburgh. where we hate so
many ethnic communities. we
have to have this type of pro-
gram." The large foreign student
enrollment at Pitt was another
factor which enhanced the impor-
tance of the program.

The four or five year program
will feature many field trips to

-the countries involved and will

include many unusual courses. An
organization called Contact Africa,
which supplies teachers and mu-
sicians from Africa, will be used

I in the program. In some courses,

members of the class will learn to
play. various native instruments
and participate in classroom jam
sessions.

"This type of course is need-
ed." Davis stressed. "Integra-
tion of the arts. understanding the
cultures of other people. is im-
portant in the development of
world peace. .

/5

Davis stressed the need for all ‘V

types of students to participate in
the program. notjust blacks. "I
don't believe in this separatist
tlieoiy. The courses are for the

. entire community."

John  Sebastian interviewed’

UH 5’at1II'f'-'1;-. ‘night John Se-

_I?.'c'..*‘.’j'ari happened to Pittsburgh.

For those select few who witnes-
sed this happening. consider
yourselves fortunate that you
were in the right place at the
right time. For those of you
that weren't. all I.can say is
that to understand the intensity
of the performance. dig out all
of your old Lovin‘ Spoonful al-
bums and play them backwards
with your box on 78 rpm. then
and only then can you begin to
fathom the possibilities of what
happened at -the Mosque.

I had the extreme pleasure of
spending Saturday afternoon with
John Sebastian. driving. around
Pittsburgh doing up "numbers"

all afternoon. and still walked '

out of that concert tbeing the
hard rock enthusiast that I am:
not believing what I had seen or
heard. Do you believe in magic‘?
S.B. How do you feel. John’)
J.S.'Utterly fantastic. It's really
great to be in Pittsburgli. and I
cant wait until the show tonight.
SB. What's it going to be like‘?
J.S.» Oh, boy, you just wait and
see. Things are flowing quite freely
and I’m really satisfied,~more sat-
isfied than I’ve ever been. I’.ve
got this new band, you see, and
they are the best little band I’ve
ever played with’and that includes

‘ the Spoonful. You’ll see.

S.B. Do you. have your per-
formance planned out‘?

J.S. No. not really. I usually
rely a lot on spontaneity. kind

-of a simultaneous ,anticipation
thing.‘ you know. I like to feel‘

out the audience. because lhave
to be where they are just as
much as they‘re being where rm
at. It‘s a give and take situation.

That's why I rarely_ do a concert
stoned. I just can‘t work stoned.
\ ouve got to be sensitive. and when
I‘m stoned. especially on grass. I
get too dreamy and kind of lose
it. you know.

SIB. Tell me you weren’t stoned
at Woodstock.

J.S. Stoned. I wastripping man,
and it was ridiculous. Did you
know that I wasn’t even supposed
to play‘? Chip Monck pulled me
out of the crowd and told me to
put together a set, and that’s what
I did, but I never could figure
out how I did it. It sure was
nice, though.

S.B. Is your act slanted towards
commercialism‘?

J.S. Thats a tough one. because
to me commercial means that a
lot‘of people like it. and that‘s a
goal I try to achieve constantly.
except on the other hand my
act isn’t full of a lot of type like
a full scale attack or something.
As a song writer there's nothing
more I like to hear than some-
body saying. "Hey. man. that's-
a really great song you got there."
and I guess that's a commercial
so we'll leave it at that.

\

S.B. How long did you do solo

work before you got a band to back ‘

you up‘?

J.S. Not too long at all. After
the Spoonful, which was really a
fun thing for a long time-until we
started making some money, I
mean real money, then things got
to be a drag and Zolly split.
I was thenext to go and started
doing solo work right then.

It was alright for a while but‘
I really missed the band. I‘d*do
my shows and tell the audience

4 to listen to the songs. just letting

everything hang out. and after

awhile I got tired of it because
I was too restricted. 'I‘l1at's what
so nice about my new band~l
can do anything! I‘m a rock n‘
roller at heart. I like to turn up
my amp. sit back and get it on.
and I can really do that now.

SB. Have you gone through
many bands’? I

J.S. A few. I worked with
Dallas Taylor a lot after the
Spoonful. and almost became a
part of Crosby. Stills. .\.'asl1._.¢;
Young. They wanted me as a
drummer. and I was going to do it.
but at the last moment I got out
because I knew it .just wasn‘t
me. I almost got a thing~together
with Ry Cooder. but that fell
through too.

The same thing happened with
Little Feet. They just came out
with a really nice album. At one
point I decided to put together

. this all-star band but everybody

chickened out and I had to do
all of the engagements solo,
there was at least a dozen of them.

S.B. Do you have an album
coming out very soon‘?

J.S. As a matter of fact we are
in the middle’ of it right now.
If we weren‘t touring we'd be
in LA. working on it now. It‘s
going to be called The Four Of
Us and is nothing like the other
albums. I was quite dissatisfied
with Cheapo. Cheapo Produc-
tions Presents due to the fact
that I used too many people.

I tried to figure out the indi-
vidual or group of people that
would work out best for a cer-
tain cut and the album came out
something like seven or eight
different bands. The nature of
the‘ album is very confusing.
I’m very_ satisfied with the in-
gredients going into the new al-

 The high point of their per-

Valerie Carter. Her rendition
‘for a song called “Cook With

distinctly "country." and other
times they sounded "spacey." It
really depended on how their
fort_v year old violinist played as
it was he who seemed to deter-
mine the style.

And it was he that almost drove
me crazy with a half hour of
electric violin-moog sound ef-
fects. He was definitely talented.
but throughout the half hour I
found myself praying that one of
his strings would break or some-
one would pull the plug onhis
moog. Fo_r me his music lost its

artistic value after the first five

minutes. .

McKendree Spring did a nice
job with Neil Young's ‘.‘Down

“No Regrets.” But the rest of
their stuff was simply unimpres-

John looked about the same as
he always has, except that he
had much less hair. He still has
a free spirit and a nice mellow
touch with his guitar. He put on

~ a good show for an hour, bounc-

ing around the stage in his pop-
sicle orange bellbottoms, switch-
ing from acoustic guitar to elec-
tric guitar to harmonica to an
instrument that resembled a
miniature harpsichord.

I couldn't believe it when I
saw a little man in a brown
sportcoat waving at John B. to
wind his show up. At first Se-
bastian wouldn't budge. But after
ten minutes of the little man's
g_vrations. John slipped into his
farewell number. It was a bit
premature and it left me with a
feeling that there had been more
to come. But there are laws in

The National Organization of
Women NOW started a new chap-
ter for the Pitt-Oakland area, a
a meeting held at the University
and City Ministry Center on
'l.‘hursday evening.

The new chapter of the organi-
zation which. in the words of a
spokesperson is "dedicated to
the proposition that women. first
and foremost. are human beings.
who like other people in our so-

ciety must have a chance to de— .

velop their fullest human poten-
tial.“ will try to reach as many of
the women in the Oakland area.
including University students.
as possible. .

‘Anne Eisler and Sharon Camp-
bell. co-conveners of the new
chapter. are both Pitt students.
who believe NOW can make a

“fruitful contribution to the Oak-

land area as a whole by working
for change in such areas as the
handling of rape victims. birth
control and abortion information
and re-orientation of the educa-
tional system."

I Elly Smill, a Southern Penn-
sylvania NOW board member,
spoke of the necessity for “build-
ing local chapters, not only in
the various communities of the
large urban centers like Pitts-
burgh and Philadelphia but also
in the-small towns all across the

_ state.”,

Against Lock Haven there were few bright spots. At 118 pounds
sophomore George “Fuddy” Bryant, who appears to have shifted into

Lud Hanczar was victimized for eight points in a disatrous third

two teams exchanging the lead
from one to the other.

With two of the three techhicals
called on the Panthers during the
half’ and iiinuinberable fouls and
walking charges the contest was
over for the lioopsters. ‘

Knight was once again the top
shooter and rebounder for the
Pantiiers. collecting almost halt
of the team's points. He racked
up a/total of 31 points and 12 ‘re-
bounds.

Martin and Bruce also contri-
buted heavily to the Panthers’
total number of points—Martin
pulled in 16 and Bruce 10.

High scorer tor the Geroge
Washington squad was Clyde Bur-
well. Burwell. a 6-11 sop‘homore

center who had been averagiiig‘

13.1 points per game. collected 16
points for his squad. Because of
his height. the Panthers found it
difficult to handle the Colonial
lioopsters.

In his fotir years at Pitt. Loacn-

“Buzz" Htdl has seen his share of
sub-par officiathig. From the con-
fines of Rosewood gymnasium in
the Bronx. to the University of
Pennsylvania's Palestra. then
back to Lafayettes high school

dealt with the Panthers merciless-

Two iiigiits ago. in the wilds of
_\orthern Virgiiiia. on the Fort
Myer Army Base. Hidl and the
Panthers were once again sub-
jected to a classic display of ques-
tionable. if not down right interior

officiating. There they were down---

ed by GW 69-66. The whistle toot-
ing trend which started five initi-
utes into the ball game continued
relentlessly until the final buzzer
souiided. /

~-Dtiring that period of time the
Cats were slapped with three
technical louls and supposedly
committed 20 of the personal va-
l‘l€l_\. The difference front the
strip between the squads =17-25
vs. 6-10: is an adequate indica-
tion of which way the calls were
going.

From the outset it was obvious
that the home team had an advan-
tage above and beyond its shoot-
ing ability, and that there was
nothing that Coach Rid]. could do

about it. His objections »were,

quickly silenced by the first big
SGT.”

Randall AndRea Shine
At Michigan State

by LYNN HARRIS

The Pitt indoor track and field
team had a tough time at Michi-
gan State this weekend but there
were two shining mombers: Billy
Rea and Roosevelt Randall.

Billy Rea had an outstanding
day in the long jump by breaking
the Michigan State Field House
record and the meet record with a
25.65. The previous record had
stood from 1948. In the triple
jump Rea jammed his heal in the
first trial therefore Coach Ban—
ner scratched him from the event.
It is hopeful that Rea's injury is
not serious. I I

Roosevelt Randall placed sec-

‘ ond in the triple jump with a 40.3.

It was Randals “personal best.“
according to Coach Don l\/Iollen-
hauer. Randall's was a close sec-
ond with first being 49.454.
“Randall and Rea were the high-
lights of the meet,” said Mollen-

Xhauer.

The mile relay took fifth in their
heat of the university‘ mile relay
with a 3.19.5. Pitt was in with
some of the best competition of
the Midwest. including Michigan
State. Eastern Michigan. and Ne-
braska.

“We were respectable but not‘
as good as we had hoped." said
Mollenhauer.

The distance medley, consisting
of Tom Moore, Chuck Mozingo,

A Rich Markley, and Bob Steele fin-

ished out of the running. Pitt led
till the anchor mile leg. Bob Steele
who was anchor man was not up
to par due to not feeling well.

"We didn‘t do what we hoped."
added Mollenhauer.

Nick Martin took eighth in the
open mile. Bob O‘Neil placed eigth
in the two mile run with a 9.135.

“It was not Martin’s best mile
and O'Neill is capable of much
more,” stated Mollenhauer.

Rich Jackson won the trial heat
in the open 600 and placed fifth in
the finals. It was a "very strong
field." according to Mollenhauer.
The 600 was highlighted by Bob
Casselman. a sprinter from Mich-
igan State who set a new Ameri-
can record of 1082.

Ken Silay in the open 1000
placed fifth with a 2.12.7. doing
"very well." according to Mollen-
hauer. High jumpers Tim Riley
and George Jpin didn‘t place. Bill
Kalchaler of Pitt qualified in the
semi-final trial heat of the hurd-
lers. placing second. however.
failed to qualify for the finals.

“Overall, I was somewhat dis-
appointed,” said Mollenhauer.

"However, besides Randall and-

Rea standing out Chuck Mozingo
and Rich Markley were good for;
us;{' he continued.

Mozingo had a 48.4 in the dis- ‘

tance medley and a 48.5 in the

mile relay. Markley had a out-
standing three-fourth mile leg in
the distance medley with a 301.4.

The tracksters next meet will
be with Frostburg tomorrow night
at the Field House. beginning at
4:30 with pole vaulting. field

shot the Nittaiiy Lions. l4-5.

Although finishing with a high

not having a good shooting night,

Mack was a pushover goal-keep-'

deteiiders. beat Mack with an oil-
speed wrist shot on the glove side.

But Penn State ‘didn’t seem to

From Behind A.  
Fiberglass Mask

(Continued from Page 11)
Last night. after three and a half months of practice. l was award-

ed my first start by coaches Tom Myers and Guy Carole. I didn‘t le;
them down as we beat Penn State lMCK€€SpUl‘l l. 4-1. at the Alpine. 'l‘nc
lollowiiig is a View of the game through a fiberglass mask.

Stat
skat

l was nervous about the first shot going in and it showed. Pent.
es first shot was not strong but I barely got the blade of my right
e on it. We definitely weren‘t skating well at alLey'en tliottgli we

kept the play’ in their end. Mike Kohl got credit for a goal when a PS1."
defeiisemaii cleared the puck into his own net. My first real test came

wlie

n a PSI" skater broke through our defense.
I was surprised to see him in so close and was caught a little too

deep in the crease. His shot was headed for the right corner and I bare-

ly got my right leg out in time to deflect behind the net. A few saves on’

long shots later, I was in the dressing room with a one goal lead.

1 was starting to think shutout when the second period began and

it cost me my wish’. After a couple of saves. the puck stayed down ll:
the PSU end for a while. and I began to lose my concentration. Its quite

easy

to do. when you haven‘t seen a hard shot for a few minutes. Fred

Mauro stickliandled. into our zone and fired a wrist shot from anout 1.3

feet

that beat me on the gloy'e side.

/

it was my fault all the way. [didn't conceinrate on the puck enougi.

to catch it. But one thing a goalie cant do is let a goal get him down.

When the red light goes on everyone looks at the goaltender but I said: .

to my self. "So it goes." and made sure I kept awake at all times. PSL

only

put one good shot from handshakhig range on me in the second

period. and I made the save. We got two more and went lliit) the dress-

iiigi

mom with a 3-1 lead. ,
We got one right on the bat in the third period and I knew that P51

would put some pressure on me in the last period. We were a man shor.
when they finally got around to 11. Uur defense had been playing well
btit this time they let a PSU skater in on the top of the crease and I had

to make a pair of saves I0 keep our lead in tact. -
