Debaters
(Continued from Page 1)
will be the natural rivalry stirred up

 

between the two schools by Janu- H

ary’s Rose Bowl game.
Thenthere will be-another factor,
a more or less personal one for
Charles W. Lomas, coach of the Uni-
versity debaters. Lomas’ team will be
meeting a pair coached by Aibert L.
Franzke, professor of speech and di-
rector of varsity debate at -Wash-
ington. V’ H C" ” ' ‘ '
When Coach Lomas was a student
at Carroll 4’ College -_ in T Wisconsin,
Coach Franzke was in charge of de-
baters at neighboring Lawrence Col-
lege. As a result, Mr. Lomas fre-
quently debated against Franzke-
coachecl teams. In view of these
facts, the debate tomorrow will be
something in the way of a remote-
control reunion for the two coaches.
When the University tendered an
invitation to Washington for a de-
bate, it was decided to stage the
debate according.t'o problem-solving‘
rules. Invented by Professor F. W.
Orr, director of speech at the Seattle
school, it has been used by that Uni-
versity almost exclusively this year
in its debates on the Paciﬁc Coast.
At the same time, at Penn State
College, Pa., two representatives each
from the University Men’s and Wom-
en’s‘ Debating Associations will be

taking part in the second annual In-

tercollegiate Mock Legislative Con-
vention sponsored by the Penn State

his moneyfs worth in what he buys,
Mr. Dixon said that the situation is
due to"-the inadequate educationof
the consumer., the failure of modern
competition, a poor» distribution of
wealth, and inefficient. buyi_ng- habits
of the majority of the people.

Most peoplgaccording to Mr. Dix-
on, place ‘too much faith in advertis-
ing, which is often misleading, and do
not make suificienttests of articles
t-heyuse.

As iniprovements, he. suggested

that government legislation should be -

passed providing minimum standards
of quality for all articles of life
whether food, clothing, or shelter. Mr.
Dixon feels that students in both

grammar and high schools should be

given basic ‘education in buying

methods. ,

in the site and the personnel of their
competition will not react adversely
on their performance. As a matter of
fact, it was because of the team's‘
wishes that the change was effected.

The Central Conference champion-
ships will be held on a dirt‘ track a=
against the more m1fa‘:‘1ili:1r.bo:11‘ds
of Madison Square Garden, the IC4A
battleground. Pitt’s own track house
has a dirt track, and the Olsonmen,
therefore, are able to showto better
advantage on that type. of running
ground.

Close to. 40 colleges will compete
in the evening’s bill of fare in quest
of a championship held _by the Pan-
thers in 1934. Favorites this year
are Notre Dame, Marquette, and
Drake. Pitt, being a last minute en-

try, must be considered a dark horse: -

An independent survey wasmade recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

  Miss Lawrence veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s Why so many of them
smoke Luckies.You,~too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies-“—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
“It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.

,  t -y Panther Humor

 LATEST “PANTHER” stunt should
_.h'_ , prove ‘meteor less classic in the ‘stunt history
_of».the.Unive-rsity’s “alleged” humorous publica-
tion. Just how many people they are convincing
is notso. important as the ingenuity they (the
staff "m‘embers‘and Madame Editor) use in effect-
ii_1’g'.th¢ir" latest escapade. This almost takes
s'ome,..o.f,us back to the days when Joe E. Brown
End William N issley McNair were receiving Pan-
tlier plaques, and having a good time with it all,
too;,and when the Penn State Froth had the
absolutely “classic” taste of insubordination—a
bad one at.that—when one of the minor editors
com posed’ a bit of an ode to the editor, the full
signiﬁcance of which passed over the heads of
the good taste" censors until the thingwas pub-
lished, an_d»..the..harm was done. Then, if you
a'i‘e~'interested' in more history, we can go back
e_v’én,further to the time when the art work on
thezoutside cover of our own Panther looked
iiiuch like a -French postcard sketch on canvas
¢"j_h:..revue,at;the I.nternati.onal, or an even more
ridiculous comparison. Also, the FIRST Lady
‘Panther editor _b_ack_in the days of the Big War

.  . . .,they tell us she" took an early vacation.

This is merely cited forits historical value, and
h;ds‘no relationship or signiﬁcance to -the present
situ’aition.. I,  -

‘.,-:_‘,Vl/_ell,,to_“get_.back__ into date, the boys say the
editor i's'~a dictator, pointing to the placard grac-
ihg*-her desk, ‘.‘You may be right, but I’m the edi-
tot.” "So there is a strike; we don’t know where
they get the “sit-down,” except that perhaps that
is"take'n from the customary position in which
we usually ﬁnd -the boys. Photographers——
tli‘ey’re a_l__ways_ necessary-—were ‘called in yester-
day,’ and, the “strike” was off'icia1ly““on;” -.Th.e
e,ditor',, little’ ”'Mis_s'“Irene7 Matveak, CS7, ‘has
riothing-,to,say, ’excep~t—-and that is plenty. Of
course,‘ ,-you -‘are told she knows nothing except

tliiit the magazine has* been. “most successful——-

just look at tli'E:”books." -L She-knows nothing ex-
cept that it is a big surprise, etc. . . . Well, we
hope the latest stunt works, and venture that,
believe it/or not, the ne.xt',number will be the first
whiz-bang-_ issue" of the "year. . '

When a Pitt football player feels the urge of sel_1'- .
expression, he ﬁnds solace in the dance ——- at least in
some cases.

Under the tutelage of 3'31.’-zabeth Tel. Rczirick, assis-
tant professor of physical education, half a dozen foot-
ballers, along with a sprinkling of basketball and track‘.
stars, regularly “trip it,” and for that matter hop, skip,
run, jump, slide, glide and pirouette it, _“on the liglit
fantastic toe” at Trees gyninasium. every "l_"uesd;.iy mid
Thursday between the hours of 12 and 1 o’clock.

The football players imiulgiiig in this forni of 22435;-

Musulin, Frank Soiichak, Edward Spotovich, and Wil-
liam Stapulis. ‘ —

in civilized life is dancing considered etfeminate.
Furthermore, men. are naturally better daucezrs them
women, Miss Rearick believes—-—at least in the dances
calling for strength and agility. And that’s the kind
the football boys are doing. The women are better. she
admits, for the dainty type of dancing, but the dainty
type of dancing is seldom taught any more. Even
women majors at the University do the other kind.
Enlisted in the dancing class i.n addition to those al-

Insects ‘T_al<e The Stand’ ,_

Can the color of an insect be changed by injecting
dyes into it? Will the change in lieat or humidity af-
fect the growth of the insect?

These are the questions to be answered in the ex-

insects. The subjects are placed in rooms with various
degrees of light and humidity. After anieasiired
length of time they are removed and the chaxigezs noted.

Some of the insects are exposed to difi'e1'ent colored
lights to see if there is any change in their colors. An-
other manner of attempting to change the colors of the
subject is to inject pure food dyes into caterpillars.

The results are determined when the insect has reached
adult stage. 0 ‘
