bomb threat

The Pitt News Staff

As Pitt hits a total of 67 bomb
threats received this semester, a
Pitt spokesman said an addition-
al threat went unnoticed.

University spokesman Robert
Hill said in a WPTS interview on
Wednesday that a bomb threat
was sent to one of his “devices”
Saturday at 10 p.m., but because
he was traveling, he did not see
it until 24 hours later on Sunday
at 10 p.m.

“So obviously there was no

Five dorms, Nordenberg’s
house receive bomb threats A

The Pitt News Staff

An Emergency Notiﬁcation Sys-
tem alert emptied ﬁve upper-
classman dorms early Wednes-
day morning, hours after
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s
house received a bomb threat.

After these threats were
made, authorities said they have
made progress in the bomb-
threat investigation, although no
arrests have been made.

David Hickton, United States
Attorney for the Western District
of Pennsylvania, issued a state-

ment Tuesday saying that au— .

thorities have made “signiﬁcant
progress in the investigation”

of the bomb threats, but he did

not expand on exactly what this ‘

meant.

Rumors about suspects have
been circulating the Internet on
various blogs dedicated to the
Pitt bomb threats, and many
people have reported their -ﬁnd-
ings to police.

,“We thank the University of
Pittsburgh students and commu-
nity members for the informa-
tion they have provided so far.
The information has helped us to
focus upon potential suspects,”

Hickton said in the statement.’

“We encourage anyone who
thinks that they may have infor-
mation to continue sharing this
with law enforcement.”

Pitt spokesperson Robert Hill
said there has been no arrest, and
the overall investigation contin-
ues. He would not comment on
rumors of suspects “in order to
protect the integrity of the inves-

‘ tigation.”

“The University will not com-

ment on its details, the identity -

of those who may or may not be
of interest, or who may or may
not have been cleared,” Hill said.

Pitt sent out an ENS alert just
after 4 a.m. Wednesday empty-
ing Ruskin Hall, Panther Hall,
Oakwood Apartments, Centre
Plaza Apartments and Bouquet

Gardens. The threats brought the ‘

count of bomb threats on campus

evacuation then, but there was

also no device that exploded,”
Hill said. “So basically that was
another hoax, but something we
didn’t know about until basically
after the fact.”

Hill conﬁrmed in the inter-
view with WPTS news director
Chazz Aden that the threat tar-
geted a University building, but
he declined to say which one be-
cause, “First of all, it didn’t hap-
pen, and I don’t want to give any-
body any ideas,” he said.

The 4 p.m. WPTS segment
marked one of the ﬁrst public
interviews a member of the Pitt
administration has participated
in concerning the string of bomb
threats this semester.

Hill said that the weekend
threat wasn’t the only time Pitt
didn’t respond to a threat — im-
mediately at least.

On April 3, Litchﬁeld Towers

- received its ﬁrst bomb threat,

sent to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette at 2 a.m. Hill said that
while Pitt police were process-
ing the threat, another one came
through an hour after the ﬁrst.
Pitt then evacuated Towers. An

Emergency Notiﬁcation System
alert was not sent out concerning
the evacuation.

“Other than that [threat Hill
received] and Litchﬁeld, we have
responded immediately,” Hill
said. _

New security measures

On Sunday night, Pitt sent out
a message to students and fac-
ulty notifying them of new secu-
rity measures across campus that
went into effect Monday.

The ﬁrst message said that
access to buildings would be re-

stricted to certain entrances and _

that Pitt IDs would be checked
upon entering. It also said that
no one would be allowed-to bring
bags into the buildings.

Hill said that University of-
ﬁcials immediately‘ heard from
students who indicated that it
was “too severe a restriction for
their normal activities of bring-
ing laptops, books, supplies and
the like.”

A few hours later, Pitt modi-

ﬁed the security measures in di-
rect response to students’ con-

cerns about how inconvenient.

the original measures would be.

The new policyphas allowed peo-
ple to bring bags into buildings as
long as they are ﬁrst checked by
security. _ -

Hill said that once the build-
ings are swept clean and no de-
vices are found, Pitt restricts
further access to the buildings.
Only a few entrances are open,
and security guards stand at each
one, checking people’s Pitt IDs
and searching bags.

Hill said the process of re-
stricting access to main‘Univer-
sity academic and residential
facilities is part of a program to
reassure people of the security
on campus.

“We’re fortunate these have
been threats —. as disruptive as
they are, they have not resulted
in an explosion,” Hill said.

’If ‘ threats are received at the
restricted buildings, the build-
ings will still be evacuated, but
Hill said the possibility of anyone
bringing in an explosive device is
diminished. . 4

He said that while no ap-
proach to security can 100 per-

' cent guarantee that a threat won’t

be carried out, what Pitt can do is

  Offering

“assure safety to the best ability
of the University.”

“We would rather err on the
side of evacuations, checkpoints,
search bags than do nothing,”
Hill said. “We’re balancing se-
curity measures against conve-
nience; security’s going to win
out.”

Hill also clariﬁed that for
events held on campus, non—Uni-
versity affiliates can show a driv-
ers license or other form of ID to
enter a building. The guest must
then be escorted by the host of
the event while in the building.

Hill -couldn’t conﬁrm whether-

or not the new security measures
are speeding up the process of
evacuations and readmission

into buildings because he said _

he hadn’t examined the timing of
evacuations. ‘
A The ongoing investigation

Hill said that the Pitt police‘

are continuing‘ the search for
the person responsible for the

threats and that if the threats

continue, students can expect to

see more administration outside

during nighttime evacuations.

down those responsible and put
an end to this plague against
people of the University of Pitts-
burgh,” Hill said. _

Hill said evidence of support
from members of the administra-
tion can be seen as they are out
with students during the evacu-
ations “trying to reassure them

that the safety and security of the '

campus community is top prior-
ity.” ' _
Hill said that ' Kathy Hum-
phrey, vice provost- and dean of
students, has talked with numer-
ous student groups, including the
Student Govern,ment,Board and
students in residence‘halls, to get
their feedback on the threats.
When it comes to divulging

more details, Hill said Pitt is go- '

ing to have to wait until the inves-
tigation is complete. _
' While .Pitt has offered a
$50,000 reward for informa-
tion regarding the bomb threats,
the student body has yet to get a
monetary ﬁgure for the cost of
the threats. b

Students’ hnmh-threat response heartening

For the past few weeks, Pitt has
served as a useful experiment in.
the power of decentralized in-
formation sources.

Aside from ENS texts, a few
scattered press releases from
public oﬁicials and reporting
from local —— and now nation-
al — "press sources, we ﬁnd
ourselves reliant primarily on
informal Internet, communi-
ties for information. This new,
unorganized system has proved
surprisingly robust, given the
circumstances. I

Reddit, Facebook and Twit-
ter now often inform us about
building evacuations before the
ENS .text system. Apparently,
the lag time requiredfor cen-
tral authorities to send notices
out in batches is longer than the
time required for a social-—media
user to start complaining about
another building being evacu-
ated. And in the cases when
information about evacuations
is wrong, or when somebody
deliberately ‘tries to, distort
the ﬂow of information on the
Internet, errors are often cor-
rected within minutes.

More surprisingly, the In-’
ternet is not only spreading

information, but also analyzing‘
it, often improving the situa-

tion on the ground for students. I

Stopthepittbombthreats.blog-
spot.com, a website begun in
the past few weeks to aggregate
observations and patterns re-
lated to the bomb threats, has
proven to be immensely popu-
lar and useful, collecting more
than 350,000 page views since
its launch. The creator, who ap-
parently has some intelligence
background, has been offering
the campus a comprehensive
analytical summary with each
round of threats, providing a
more complete analysis than
any other single site. ‘

The discussion moves be- ‘

yond the lcreator’s opinions,
however, with other users
commenting and -providing ad-
ditional insight into the day’s
events. As on any website, there
are many comments of ques-
tionable value, to say the least,

. but the aggregate effect of dis-

cussion has been positive, with
members of the community able
to try and discern some truths

about these events. At the very I

least, it offers the community a

collective outlet for our frustra-

tions. — . » » »
And while we would have ex-

pected some informal support

group to start on Facebook, few
would have anticipatedthe cre-
ation of several‘ couch-surﬁng

websites to‘ connect displaced

dorm residents with students

’who reside off—campus. Not

only does this demonstrate a
high level of g'ood-heartedness

and philanthropy, but also a

remarkable capability for high-
level organization . without’ a
central. agency controlling in-
formation. * I V
There are, of course, draw-
backs to this new world of in-

formation. On Monday night,

a speciﬁc blog post by a Reddit
user quickly jumped in popular-
ity, and the accompanying link
to a conspiratorial blog made

the rounds on so<:ial-network- ,
ing sites. Similarly rumorous -

tweets and Facebook posts have»
experienced bursts in popular-
ity over the course of the last
week. In more than one case,

the unveriﬁable’ information
quickly sent many students into

conﬁision and fear — an un-

' avoidable drawback of unedited

information that reminds .us

that the democratic nature’ _of

the Internet doesn’t always pro-
duce instant accuracy.

Moving forward, we feel it is
best to remain cautious when
spreading, what are possibly
false rumors. Also, as has been

pointed out by users on these

sites, it is possible the per-
son or people_ responsible for
the threats to read the online

stream of information, and this i
, should not be forgotten.

Yet all told, the impact of
these new information sources

has been — some would say .

surprisingly ’—,— A positive. We’ve
been discovering information
faster ‘and more comprehen-

I sively than we would have other-

wise. Traditional news sources

and University authorities have I

responsibilities and restrictions
that prevent them from serving
such a function on the campus.
We can be happy and comforted

‘ that, during these times, there

is a community online serving a
very useful function within the
University discourse. |

QPINIONS

A MIDWESTERN PIECE?

Tmyvon Martin case merits pause

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

“Rashomon,” directed by Akira Kurosawa, is one
of the great classics ofjapanese cinema.-
Its plot revolves around a murder, but what re-

ally happens_is never established. The murder is

recounted from a number of different perspectives
and slants, each of which is different, leaving the
audience guessing. . 

We are in the middle of our very own version of
“Rashomon,” one that touches on all~of the most
inﬂammatory issues in the United States. .The
Trayvon Martin shooting has exploded all over
the airwaves. The Martin family holds that Tray-
Von was walking home, minding his own business,

saw -his shooter, ﬂed and was shot in cold blood. ' 

George Zimmerman,‘ the man who pulled the
trigger, claims that he acted in self-defense after
Martin assaulted him and pounded his head into
the pavement. The police report says that Zim-
merman’s head was bloody and his back had grass
stains on it. But was that caused by an unprovoked
assault?‘ Was Martin defending himself from a
crazy guy with a gun? What about a video recently
released by ABC that apparently shows a very un-
bloodied Zimmerman at the police station?

I don’t want to comment on the facts of the case
itself. I don’t know what they are.‘ I’ve heard a lot
of things from a lot of different people, but I wasn’t

there, and the investigation is ongoing. The stories ,

we’re hearing from the media are incomplete; the
media does not have subpoena power, and critical
records, such as the autopsy report, are sealed.

Everything that I’ve heard in the Martin case
leads me to three or four possible conclusions
about what‘ happened, which would lead me to
three or four possible opinions on this case. Flor-
ida special prosecutor Angela Corey is now decid-
ing the best way forward legally. I hope that justice
is served.

I will say a few things based on what I have seen

personally. First, and above all, if the Department .

of Justice ﬁnds that the law—enforcement agencies
that initially didn’t arrest George Zimmerman did
so because of race or clout, heads need to roll at
the Stanford, Fla., police department and the Flor-
ida State Attorney’s office. ,
But heads should roll and people should be
punished based on an investigation, not on the

,say—so of the public. Considering that the locals

might not be trusted to investigate the case, calls
for the Department of Justice to step in are com-
pletely appropriate. However, the petitions call-
ing for Zimmerman’s prosecution are inappropri-
ate. We don’t arrest people based on the opinions
of people around the country. If we were to start
arresting people because the public demanded
it, we would move toward vigilantism. And if we
can’t trust the feds to do a thorough investigation
in a case like this, we create a dangerous mindset
where the only way to get justice is.to obtain it for
ourselves.

mu "1 LEnII|pu*;

The media has behaved disgracefully in this
situation. Granted, this case needs media atten-
tion because it keeps everybody honest. Yet the
cause of justice is not helped by showing two sets
of side—by—side photos, with one set of photos be-
ing a scrawny black kid and a mug shot of a white
guy and the other set being a strapping football
player and a smiling, very Hispanic—looking guy
in a suit. The only point of something like that is
to invite the sub—caption “Whom do you believe?”

Having black and white people yell at each other '

on TV doesn’t help either. Interviews of eyewit-

nesses -might end up leading to accusations of a '

biased jury if this case goes to trial, especially be-
cause the eyewitnesses are not only talking about
what they saw, but also speculating about what
they thought happened in a manner that would
not be permitted in court. This harms the cause of
justice. If Zimmerman is found guilty, the convic-
tion is going to be appealed on the grounds that
there aren’t 12 people in thiscountry who haven’t
heard all about this case. '

Finally, the media has been dishonest about
some facets of the case. For example, Zimmer-
man’s 911 call was edited by NBC so that it read
“the guy looks like he’s up to no good  He looks
black,” omitting what was in the ellipsis, namely,
the 911 dispatcher asking, “OK, is he white, black
or Hispanic?” Considering this, we need to ask
ourselves what else the media might not be getting
right.

In short, before we rush to judgment, we need to
be aware that we don’t have the entire story. The De-
partment of Justice will investigate thoroughly, and
then we’ll have more ﬁrm ground to stand on. I

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

On Easter Sunday, Pitt students received
an email informing them of a wide range
of unprecedented security measures to be
implemented in response to’ the ongoing
bomb threats. The measures were imple-
mented unilaterally without any student in-
volvement in the decision-making process.

Any change that limits student or faculty
freedom should be made in an open manner,

. with input from all affected. It is the students

who are roused out of bed at 3:56 a.m., forced
to leave unﬁnished exams and frustrated by

every night without these threats. This same
administration has not even had a public de-
bate on how to proceed, much less let SGB
decide on how to combat these threats.

The administration’s secretive deci-
sion—making process is unacceptable. It
should convene an assembly of /students
and faculty to decide, or at least publicly
discuss, all future policy decisions regard-
ing the bomb threats. _The administration
also needs to ﬁnd some way of informing
the broader student body as to how deci-
sions are being made.

inconvenienced, and I ask the rest of you
to feel the same. I will perceive every can-
celed class as a defeat, every bag search as
an insult, every unilaterally enacted pol-
icy as a betrayal, but every time the cam-
pus comes together as victory until these

threats stop.
Daniel Glazier
School of Arts 8: Sciences

To the Editor,
The University should stop using the
Emergency Notiﬁcationsystem every time

could encourage copycats.

Additionally, the multiple messages wa-
ter down the importance of the ENS system,
possibly causing students to stop taking mes-
sages seriously. If there is another shooter on
campus in the future, we might regret having
used the ENS so liberally. A bomb threat is
very different from an active shooter.

Finally, the ENS is not the most effective
way to communicate to relevant people. A
ﬁre alarm in the threatened building would
be more effective without all the negative
consequences; “ S E '

f Knowing music’s roots lleep

By Chazz Aden
WPTS Contributor

Music cannot stand still. The
music you listen to daily comes
from a rich myriad of inﬂuences

and experimentation, and
this exploration is how
listening can be enriched.

This Monday, Screaming Females
came to the Mr. Roboto Project.
This band has changed its music
throughout its career, and the
band still continues to evolve
their sound.

It may be a cliche of the
pretentious music snob to scoff at ~
new releases and declare earlier
records superior, but there is
value in seeking out the origin of
cool sounds.

Screaming Females has earlier
work that demonstrates the
themes of their later albums.
“Arm over Arm,” an early single,
includes a riff that would later be
fully realized on “Mothership,”
a track off their album What if
Someone is Watching their TV?

Going back to ﬁnd my music’s
roots has been valuable and
has enhanced my listening
experience. I’ve heard artists
forging their identity or playing
with genre bounds, musicians
ﬁguring out how to make
cool music together, and I’ve
witnessed the fun that’ comes
with just making music.

The early works of Bob Dylan _

paint a portrait of a folk artist
in love with the blues but still
allow a space for him to grow into
something completely different.

Propagandhi is another
fantastic example of a band that
took the time and grew into its
sound. By recognizing the band’s
progression from earlier albums
like 1996’s Less Talk, More
Rock to later albums like 2009’s
Supporting Caste, a listener
can take in the development of
increasingly complex concepts,
both musically and lyrically.

But the search can move
beyond simply ﬁnding the earlier
works of a single artist, and

.an eager listener can begin to ~

of the hip-hop scene, is the sense

Doll dances,

By Anna Weldon
Senior Staff Writer

Most love triangles are complicat- .

ed enough, but with a doll in the
mix, things can get really messy.
The Pittsburgh Ballet The-
atre will present “Coppelia” at
the Benedum Center this week-
end. The three-act ballet tells the

A love story of Franz and Swanilda

and their run—in with a life—like
doll, while weaving together the
simple lives. of the village peas-
ants with the mad creations of Dr.
Coppelius.

Terrence S. Orr, the artistic
director at the theatre, said the
ballet arose at the end of the R0-
mantic era in the 1870s. The story
focuses primarily on the two char-

romances in Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s ‘Coppelia’

acters in love and the games they
play with each other.

Dr. Coppelius, the doll’s cre-
ator, is an old doll maker whose
slightly eccentric persona has
the rest of the town thinking he is
mad. Obsessed with dolls, the old
doctor believes he can bring his
creations to life with a little bit of
magic.

‘Coppelia, one of Dr. Coppelius’
dolls, sparks Franz’s interest and
leads him to pursue the lifeless
creature. Swanilda’s jealousy over
Franz’s new love interest gets the
best of her, and chaos ensues in
Dr. Coppelius’ laboratory. V

Swanilda takes the place of
Coppelia and acts like a doll. After
she plays her trick, Dr. Coppelius
realizes he cannot bring his cre-
ations to life.

Because the -ballet has been
around for so long, Orr believes it
has certain universal characteris-
tics that keep audiences intrigued.
The complex love story has yet to
lose its compelling components,
but the ballet’s real timelessness
derives from the changes’ that
have occurred over the past 140
years, he said.

“.1 think one of the things -that
makes this work is that it isn’t like
it was 14_0 years ago. If it was, we
wouldn’t want to see it,” Orr said.

Certain changes to various ele-

ments of “Coppelia,” such as tech—.

nical components or more theat-
rical elements, have helped the
ballet to grow and become more
complex. ~ .
Stephen Hadala, the corps de
ballet member performing the

role of Dr. Coppelius, explained
the comedic side of the ballet. _’

“It’s a really old ballet, but it’s
a lot funnier. There is a lot more
comedy than some of the older
classics,” he said.

Hadala performs his role en-
ergetically in order to add to the
comedy. He _ and the other two
lead ‘roles, Franz and Swanilda,
have the most humorous parts in
the ballet, he said. Certain funny
moments lend to the ballet’s ap-
peal. -

For example, during one scene
in the ballet when Swanilda pre-
tends to be Coppelia, she slaps
Dr. Coppelius in the face. These
moments relate to “present—day
audiences,” Hadala said. ‘

He also uses the varying mu-
sical tones from the orchestra to

topic of discussion during Ultra Dive’s ‘9os Night.

Jelly shoes, scrunchies, mood rings and
roller blades .— these are just _a few of the
iconic reminders ofa ’9os childhood.
Right outside Oakland, there is a
bar that can rush you back to the time
of Spice Girls and boy bands — “Fresh
Prince,” spike-haired Backstreet Boys
and all. Belvedere’s ‘Ultra Dive’s ’9os
Night has become a monthly go—to for
me and my friends over the past year.
Belvedere’s, which .is located on
Butler Street in Lawrenceville, welcomes
guests with specially themed nights
promoted by Joy Toujours, the bar’s
promoter. The doorman greets those
entering through the narrow door and
then waits, ready to emblazon the hands

of the next arrivals with Belvedere’s
trademark “You are beautiful” stamp.
“We put the stamp on people’s hands,

A and they immediately smile. Anything

you can do that makes someone smile,”
Toujours said. - ‘

Even though the \ front bar area
prohibits ' smoking,
‘continues to serve as a smoking bar
throughout the rest of its facility, which
accumulates a considerable amount of
cigarette smoke. -

There might only be a few ba,r—goers
who choose to match the ’9os Night
theme, leading to very few scrunchies on
the dance floor. Instead, a blend of punk
rock, hipster—esque plaid and skinny
jeans color the bar’s jam session. .

Label celebrates Cash’s
80th birthday with release

MCI‘ Campus

This newest release sliowcases a more gospel side ol'_]ohnn_v Cash's musical repertoire.

By Anna Weldon
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Had the legendary Johnny Cash still been
alive, he would have had his 80th birthday
this February.

In honor of his death, Columbia/Legacy
released Bootleg Vol. IV: The Soul of Truth
on April 3 as the ﬁrst release to his birthday’
celebration. The two~CD, 51—track collec-
tion of gospel and spiritual songs includes
a variety of previously released and unre-
leased material.’It offers listeners a chance
to reﬂect on Cash’s career and recall his
multi-genre talents.

Cash began his career after the Air Force
discharged him in 1954. He auditioned that
year at Sam Phillips’ Sun Records as a solo
gospel artist but eventually ended up drop-
ping gospel music and recording with his
band, The Tennessee Three. v

Shortly after a few failed releases, Cash

«gained acclaim for his song “I Walk the

Line,” a 19505 hit that remains popular to-
day. Though his gospel—music aspirations
at times took a back seat to his exploration
of a more mainstream sound, Cash still re-
corded gospel tracks periodically, many of
which can be found on Bootleg Vol. IV: The
Soul of Truth.

Cash recorded the music on the album

from 1958 to 1983. Though many of the T

tracks have been previously released, oth-
ers have not, and the new material gives the
set a fresh spin.’ Songs like “Truth,” “Back
in the Fold” and “What is Man” appear for
the ﬁrst time on this collection.

The album consists of traditional gos-
pel and folk tracks as well as original
tracks that Cash wrote. Religious listeners
might even recognize some of the tracks as
hymns. '

His recognizable, bass—baritone looms
throughout the album and gives a dark

Grade: A

twist to the upbeat songs. Even when sing-
ing gospel music, Johnny Cash remains the
“Man in Black.”

Bootleg Vol. IV: The Soul of Truth has a
simple sound, avoiding most complicated

' musical elements. As in otherjohnny Cash

recordings, the singer’s voice and delivery
contain more power than the music behind
it.

The album has something for both
gospel—music listeners and fans of Johnny
Cash. The spiritual nature of the songs
holds religious signiﬁcance, but Cash’s
talent and popular sound still resonates,
making the tracks less traditional gospel
music. _

The songs mostly feature Cash’s coun-
try—blues sound, but some tracks come
across a little differently. “I’ve Got Jesus
In My Soul,” a traditional gospel song that
Cash recorded with the Carter Family,
sounds more like a church band perfor-
mance than a Johnny Cash song. But the
album is not compiled to emphasize Cash’s
dark persona; instead, it demonstrates his
more religious characteristics.

Still, despite the spiritual lyrics, the two
discs pay a good tribute to Johnny Cash’s
career. They embody his sultry sound
while attributing religion to his music. The
spiritual component does not suppress his
obvious talent. m

reminiscent of Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me

* “Hold On,” is destined for pop success.

The album’s two space-ﬁlling tracks,
“Hang Loose” and “Goin’ To the Party,”
ﬁnish quickly enough not to distract from
the stellar songs surrounding them.

The screaming organ on the track
“Heartbreaker” will undoubtedly be fea-
tured on numerous angry, post-breakup
mixes.

The album closes with “On Your Way,”
a track that could easily have slipped into
a Kings of Leon—type mediocrity, but How-

Even if, like the Black Keys before it, the

group needs to sell its songs through Zales V

commercials — as it did during the 2011
holiday season with the Otis Redding-in-

The hype surrounding the band stems
from its strong reputation for outstanding

live performances and a well—received se1f— T

the music director and principal conduc-
tor, conducts the orchestra that accompa-
nies PBT’s version of “Coppelia.”

Barker, who has conducted “Coppelia”
numerous times over the last 20 years, no
longer has to spend weeks on preparing
the score. Because he is familiar with the
music, Barker can focus on illuminating
certain musical components that hemay
have previously missed.

The music, composed by Léo Delibes,
is melodic, he said.

“He was all about composing a beautif

ful melody. His orchestration was ﬁne and
detailed, and he tended to stick to just the
strings or just the winds,” Barker said.

Barker explained that he used his har-
monies in a theatrical way that is notice-
able in “Coppelia,” but his music is note
very complex. His simplicity leads to the
music’s beauty, Barker said.

Live music also plays an important role
in the bal1et’s delivery. The live produc-
tion creates a sense of spontaneity in the
performance that can cause certain un:__,
planned differences to arise.

“Theatre is all about the performance
right now. It has to be good. It has to be dif-
ferent. It has to be unique,” Barker said.

Miami Marlins, you knew it was
coming,

Ozzie Guillen, major league
baseball’s big-mouth manager
best known for hot—headed
tirades and not thinking before
he speaks, let another gem ﬂy the
other day when he proclaimed his
admiration for Fidel Castro.

After his tearful apology
to the city of Miami and the
Latin American community on
Tuesday, the Miami Marlins
suspended Guillen for ﬁve games.
But the hypocrisy of the whole
situation is ridiculous.

Although publicly expressing
support for a Communist
dictator who held power in a
repressive regime for more than
50 years is obviously a moronic,
insensitive ' and politically
incorrect thing to do, issuing a
suspension for it is even worse.
Granted, Miami’s ‘huge Cuban
population makes it the one city
where you would deﬁnitely not
want to uttersuch a remark But
this is precisely the reason Ozzie
was hired.

The Marlins have just moved
into a brand—new stadium (that
has so many over-the—top features

that it’s a veritable Frankenstein V

of ballparks), revamped. their
logo, team colors and team name
(previously the Florida Marlins)
and spent lavishly on several
high-proﬁle free agents in an
effort to renew their failing fan
base — seriously, their contests
used to make ‘Pirates games look
crowded.

‘ And then owner Jeffrey Loria,
ignoring the fact that Guillen’s
antics grew old in Chicago,
found a high-proﬁle manager
whose antics can draw a crowd
by themselves. Loria wanted
zany sound bites and colorful
on-ﬁeld explosions, but he never
expected the ﬁrst one to alienate
the fan base that the team was
trying to reclaim. He should
have.

This is not the ﬁrst time
Guillen has initiated controversy,
and it is not the ﬁrst time that
he has expressed this fandom
of Fidel Castro. In 2008, the
Venezuelan-born Guillen told
Men’s Journal that Castro was
the “toughest man he knows”
because of his ability to remain

n praises Fidel Castro

in power despite the constant
attempts to remove him. (For
the record, he also said, “I don’t

admire his philosophy; I admire .

him,” in that interview.)
But Guillen had also expressed

admiration for the controversial «

Venezuelan President Hugo

' Chavez in2005.In bothinstances,

he has retracted his statements.
On top of that, in 2006 Guillen
was ﬁned by the league and

ordered to undergo sensitivity.

training after using aﬁgay slur
in a post-game rant aimed at a
reporter. ' .

The most troubling thin
about this whole situation is not
that Guillen is being suspended
for doing what has been expected
of him; it’s the outrage that has
come from the remarks.

No, We shouldn’t praise a
dictator (although it’s difficult to
argue that Castro is worse than
the violent and militaristic U.S.-
backed Fulgencio Batista regime
that he replaced), but since when
did we ever let what Ozzie Guillen
—— or any professional athlete —
might say affect us?

 Boston Celtics rise to top
of Atlantic Division

By Nate Barnes
Staﬁ” Writer

In sports, many teams with playoff
experience talk of the ability to “ﬂip the
switch” and play their best when it “truly
counts.” The flaw in this logic is that each
game —— at least during the regular season
—— counts the same, whether it’s in the win
or loss column.

More often than not, the cliche is often
used as an excuse for a team’s unsavory play
until that team begins performing the way
people expect it to. Growing up as a Lakers
fan, I experienced this for four years in a
row when Kobe, Shaq and Co. would lag
through the regular season and then tear
everyone’s hearts out in the playoffs.

That being said 

The Boston Celtics have ﬂipped the
proverbial switch. And for a team that
considers itself a serious playoff contender,
it’s about time.

Disclaimer: As a Laker fan, I hate the
Celtics more than anyone can understand.
Yes, even more than yinzers hate Philly
and vice Versa. Being a part of arguably
the greatest rivalry in all of sports, I can’t
imagine an NBA Playoff Tournament
without the Celtics on the other side of the
bracket, allowing for the chance of another
L.A.—Boston NBA Finals being recorded in
the annals of history.

At the beginning ofthe season, Ibelieved
the Celtics and General Manager Danny
Ainge should have blown the team up by
trading at least Ray Allen and maybe even
Kevin Garnett. They made my thoughts
look good by starting 5-9, including both
three— and ﬁve—game losing streaks.

After clawing their way above .500,

by mid-February, “the Celtics suffered
another ﬁve-game losing streak to fall to
15-17 on the year. Although three of those
losses were to powerhouses like the Dallas
Mavericks, Oklahoma City Thunder and

The Boston Celtics

have flipped the

proverbial switch.

p And for a team
that considers
itself a serious

playoff Contender,
it’s about time.

Chicago Bulls, the C’s also dropped two
games to the lowly Pistons.

Normally, being 32 games into a season
with a record slightly below .500 would not
cause concern for a team like the Celtics.
But such comfort would come from looking
forward to the rest of an 82—game season,
not the lockout-shortened 66—game season
of this year.

As a team with mettle tested in the
playoffs, the Celtics responded as expected.
Beginning with a ﬁve—game win streak
to counter the recent losing streak, ‘the
Celtics are 18-7 since Feb. 28.

The great play as of late, coupled with
the Philadelphia 76ers playing their worst
basketball all year — 10-13 since the All-
Star Break — have the Celtics" in the lead
of the Atlantic Division and a hold on the
Eastern Conference’s fourth seed by three
and a half games.

And as the “ﬂipping the switch” proverb
goes, the Celtics are certainly playing their
best basketball and getting better as the
playoffs _approach. At 8-2 in their past
10 games, Boston has the best record of
any Eastern Conference team over that
stretch.

back in the 2007-2008 season when the
Celtics took the Larry O’Brien trophy
back to Boston.

Prior to that, the Celtics lost
heartbreakers to two of the league’s

best teams, the Bulls and the Spurs. On b

April 5, the Bulls pulled away in the ﬁnal
minutes to secure an 83-86 victory. The
night before, the Spurs won by a single
point, 87-86.

The two losses ended a ﬁve-game
winning streak for Boston that featured
another win against the Miami Heat, this
one coming at home and with a 19-point
margin of victory.

With nine games remaining in Boston’s
season, the team trails the Pacers by two
games for the third seed. Acquiring this
would be advantageous for the Celtics as
it would allow them to, avoid a second-v
round matchup with the Bulls, which
would be likely if Boston were to remain
in the fourth seed, barring an upset of the

‘Bulls as the No. 1 seed.

_ If it maintains its current seed, Boston
will most likely face the Atlanta Hawks in
the ﬁrst round. If they acquire the three
seed, the Celtics would most likely face
the Magic. Although arguably a tougher
out than the Hawks, beating the Magic

would lead to a relatively easier road

to the‘ Finals for the Celtics. The_ ﬁrst
matchup would mean the second-round
would most likely pit Boston against

, Miami, a team against which the Celtics

have experienced much more success
than they have against the Bulls. I
