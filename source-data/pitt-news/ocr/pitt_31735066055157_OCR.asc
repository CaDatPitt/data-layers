Dressed in business suits and
white hard hats, Pitt and city offi-
cials thrust shovels into the South
Oakland ground yesterday to begin
construction of new student hous-
ing.
“This is an exciting day for the
University of Pittsburgh,”
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said
during a brief ceremony. “This is
also, I think, an exciting day for the
city of Pittsburgh and the Oakland

community.”

Several City Council members,
Pitt administrators and Student
Government Board President
Alyson Wallach joined Nordenberg
under a white tent set up on the SB
parking lot.

Members of Pitt’s Blue and
Gold Society greeted spectators as
cheerleaders helped bolster Pitt
pride. Members of the Pitt march-
ing band played “We’ve Got The
Spirit.”

Students mourn AIDS victims

Pitt alum reunited with class
ring after 26 years

Megan McDonald

Staff Writer

Pitt alumnus Richard Younkin
had his class ring for just one week
before he lost it 26 years ago.

Two weeks ago, he got it back.

“This is one of those things that
restores your faith in human
nature,” Younkin said.

Younkin, now a child psycholo-
gist, graduated from Pitt in 1972
and lost the ring shortly after. He
said he couldn’t afford to buy the
ring in the first place, so purchasing
another was out of the question. “I
just sucked it up and forgot about
it,” he said.

The story of the ring’s return
begins several years ago, when
Penn Dot worker Patrick Lydon
found it while picking up litter on
the Parkway east between Penn
Hills and Monroeville.

No one seems to know how the
ring got from Pitt to the berm of the

highway.

“It was in my drawer for sever-
al years,” Lydon said. “I didn’t
want to sell the ring, Ijust wanted
to give it back to its rightful
owner.”

Lydon had little luck at first,
and the ring lay forgotten in his
dresser drawer until he came across
it again a few months ago. He said
he didn’t know how to get in touch
with the owner, so he gave it to his
cousin, Thorp Cubarney, who works
in Pitt’s Biomedical Science Center.

Cubarney took the ring to the
University bookstore, which origi-
nally sold the ring, but the store
didn’t have records dating back far
enough to show who bought it.

“I saw initials and some Greek
letters on the ring, but I didn’t
know what they meant,” Cubarney
said.

She then called Pitt’s lost and
found, which informed Greek

Pitt student Lisa Santoro had to

make a choice last summer. She
could either take classes at Pitt or
travel to Italy to work on a research
project.

Santoro chose Italy and applied
for a scholarship through the
Summer Study Abroad program,

Rooms and Intercultural Exchange
Programs.

She spent five weeks in Italy

They decided to raise money that

bringing studies to life.

Bruhns. “The depth of the cultural

THE PITT NEws

Housme

as Bouquet Gardens, will consist of
three garden-style apartment build-
ings between Bouquet Street and
Oakland Avenue. The housing pro-
ject is the first new construction on
the Oakland campus since
Sutherland Hall opened in 1992.

A total of 192 upper-division
undergraduate students will live in
the complex’s 48 apartments when
construction concludes in August
1999.

With a $5.3 million price tag,
this housing is the first phase of
Pitt’s 10-year facilities plan that
accounts for $500 million worth of
construction projects. In the future,
the University will add enough
apartments for 800 students to live
at the Bouquet Street site.

Bouquet Gardens is a concrete
response to a clear and consistent
message from Oakland residents
who have wanted Pitt to build more
student housing, Nordenberg said.

“We are here today for an event
that provides tangible proof that the
University and the community can
work together to achieve a consen-
sus which recognizes the interests
of both the University of Pittsburgh
and the Oakland community that
benefits us all,” Nordenberg said.

He added that architects
designed Bouquet Gardens to fit in
with the styles of existing buildings
in South Oakland.

, Nordenberg joked that he was
certain that adequate sound-proof-
ing was part of the design, as med-
ical helicopters flew back and forth
from UPMC and Children’s
Hospital, occasionally making it

difficult to hear the speakers.

City Council _. President Bob
O’Connor said the new housing will
help Oakland reverse a 20-year eco-
nomic decline. Bouquet Gardens
will serve as a catalyst for econom-
ic recovery by keeping students in
Oakland, where they can patronize
local merchants.

He Said

He referred to Oakland as a

shopping mall, with the Forbes
Avenue shops, Wyndham Garden
Hotel and Carlow College’s new
science center.
Oakland is “like an old Cadillac
all it needs is shined up,”
O’Connor said.

O’Connor said there’s no reason

WEDNESDAY, 2 DECEMBER 1998

FROM PAGE 1

why Oakland cannot be a place
where people want to live. It has
ample resources, from Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University to hos-
pitals, libraries and museums.

“The future of Oakland is right
in front of us. Let’s grab it,”
O’Connor said.

Wallach said the beginning of
work on the facilities plan has
brought a new spirit of excitement
to campus.

New student housing is a criti-
cal element of the plan, she said,
because it will help Pitt retain stu-
dents and compete more effectively
to recruit new students. Eventually,
Pitt will offer freshmen a four—year
housing guarantee and transfer stu-
dents a two-year guarantee, she
said.

Wallach promised that students
and community members will have
no trouble living side by side.

“Pitt students who live in this
building will be good neighbors,”
she said.

Bouquet Gardens will help Pitt
give students the best possible
experience during their four years
here, Nordenberg said.

“[It] is an exciting new project
that will give our students a superi-
or living and learning experience in
a setting that will respect the com-
munity values of our neighbors,” he
said. “We sincerely hope that
today’s ground breaking is just the
first in a series of celebrations that
will recognize the efforts of all of
us to make the University and the
city even better places to live, learn
and work in the years ahead.”

RING

Advisor Kerrie Daley of the ring.
Daley recognized the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity letters and decided
to call its international headquar-
ters.

Daley came in contact with
Kathy Jemson, who researched the
records and found two people with
Younkin’s initials. One lived in
California and the other, Younkin,
in Pittsburgh.

“I decided to write -off the guy
in California,” Jemson said. “So we
went through our Pittsburgh files
under his role number and got his
location.” The files showed that he
was an active alumnus who still
donates money. After repeated
unanswered phone calls to Younkin,
Jemson decided to write him a let-
ter.

“I wrote that it was going to be
the most unusual letter that he had
ever received,” she said. “But that
we thought we might have his ring

FROM PAGE 2

from 1972.”

Younkin called Cubarney when
he received the letter.

“I was really taken aback and
pleased,” Younkin said. “There
weren’t a lot of good things hap-
pening to me that week, so this was
super”

Younkin met Cubarney a few
days later at St. Ferdinand’s Church
in Cranberry, where she and her
mother were playing bingo.

“He was so nice,” Cubarney
said. “He gave me a big hug, and
stayed with my mother and me for
20 minutes.”

Younkin’s reunion with the ring
was a bit of a surprise, because
when he tried it on it was too big.
He ‘took it to Balfour jewelers, who
said they would re-size it for free.

Younkin said he plans to wear
the ring all the time.

“It’s like those notes people
give you that make you feel so
good, you put them in your drawer
for the times when you need them,”
he said.

Sneaky bills will only backfire

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy
said Tuesday he’s no longer going to
push for Plan B.  1

What a pity, Seeing. aslre and his
cohorts put so mucheﬂiort into trying

to sneak a rider into Pennsylvania ‘

House Bill 907, which Governor
Tom Ridge vetoed Monday.

Murphy knew for weeks about
the sneaky inclusion —— which went
urmoticed until after Bill 907 was
approved by the. House. This is why
it’s no surprise that he and several
County Commissioners are under
investigation by a State-Legislature
Committee.

Like the Organ Distribution rider
(inserted by Louisiana Governor
Dick Livingston to ensure that
organs are distributed with a geo-
graphical priority rather than on the
basis of need) that was inserted into
October’s Budget Bill, which passed
the U.S. House of Representatives,
Bill 907 was a sneaky, underhanded
attempt to get a plan with uncertain
amounts of support approved.

Whether one agrees with state
funding for stadiums, the tactic of
trying to get it approved stealthily
has blown up in Allegheny County’s
face. As Gov. Ridge said at a press
conference Monday, “[it] needs to be
won on the merits, straight up, fair
and  .

The rider, which would effec-
tively have allowed Gov. Ridge to

allocate any amount toward stadium
funding that he wanted, stiffed
Philadelphia lawmakers, who are
also;  stadium ﬁsnding. The
easiest way would be for Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia to have worked on
a bill that would guarantee both cities
money for stadiums, to prevent
teams in both cities from leaving and
heading out of state (to states such as
Connecticut, which has allotted $305
million to help establish an NFL
franchise_there).

Just as outrageous is the fact that
lawmakers’ don’t seem to bother to
read the legislation they’re passing.
Even though the legislation may be
long and tedious, “little” arnend-
ments regarding stadium ﬁrnding
and transplant organ distribution are
just as important as the bills tl1ey’re
amending. If lawmakers are taking
time to pass legislation, they should
make time to read it thoroughly as
well.

Political maneuvering should be
conducted in the full view of the
public. By trying to pushing for it on
the sly, Pittsburgh has seriously
undermined its cause for stadium
funding.

While ftmding will probably still
occur (contrary to the fears of both
Murphy and Pirates owner Kevin
McC1atchy, both currently acting
like petulant children), it must ‘be
won without being sneaky.

Last weekend I went to see the movie
“Pleasantville” and was pleasantly surprised to
ﬁnd myself inspired intellectually by this
movie. The plot: Two kids from contemporary
America are whisked into a 1950s “Father
Knows Best”—esque television series called
“Pleasantville.” The two promptly wreak havoc
upon the town and its bland, black and white cit-
izens, turning most of them into self-aware peo-
ple in color. Walking out of the movie I had to
chuckle at how the director of the ﬁlm had done
such a skillful job at mocking the silliness of
how we view our past. The 1950s, long cele-
brated as a time of idyllic tranquility disrupted
by the turbulent 1960s, were not any kind of
golden age for America. The truth, as with most
things in life, is a good deal more complex.

When Bob Dole ran for president, he
launched into an attack during the Republican
National Convention against
‘i1nlcnowing” critics who dared to
suggest that things were not neces-
sarily better in the past. Dole’s
speech, an attempt by his campaign
to throw red meat to the conservative
activists whose support they needed for the fall
campaign, was a nostalgic appeal to a bygone
era that comes alive in terms of “Father Knows
Best” and “Leave It To Beaver” on Nick at
Night. As a political manifesto, it turned out to
draw adisturbing contrast. On one hand were
the forward-looking Democrats and their
“Bridge to the 21st Century,” and on the other
were the backward-looking Republicans and
their rose-colored memories of an era when the
law of the land held that African—Americans
were to be segregated from society. and women
were to content with cooking and cleaning.
Today we laugh at the absurdly bad propaganda
ﬁhns of the 1950s and their dark warnings about
the dangers of young girls giving thinking about
being something other than their husbands’
maids. Back then, they weren’t funny at all.

The 1950s, in truth, was a turbulent decade
for America. In the South, the civil-rights move-
ment fought a long series of pitched battles
against segregation that saw much bloodshed
and upheaval. In 1957, for example, U.S. Army
had to be dispatched to Little Rock, Ark., to
enforce the desegregation of a high school
there. _

wealth and prosperity, yet not everyone lived in
a pristine neighborhood. Poverty was so abun-
dant in America that Michael Harrington was
inspired to write a stunning book called ‘The
Other America,” detailing detailing the division
in America between the haves and have-nots.

People recall the 1950s as an era of law and
order, and today we decry crime and lawless-
ness as signs of a collapsing society. Watch the
news tonight, and you’ll be convinced that
America is teetering on the edge of anarchy. The
1950s, however, was hardly a crime-free era.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette recently ran an
article detailing crime stories from 1948, includ-
ing horrifying tales that we are familiar with
today (children killing each other for toys, etc.).

Today, the media give wide play to the sen-
sational and the terrifying. The unofﬁcial
mantraof the news industry is “If it bleeds, it
leads. Ifit thinks, it sinks.” America’s
ﬂirtation with crime is less a product
of a permissive judiciary than
KDKA trying to boost its ratings.

Most people will argue that
culture was better back in the 1950s,
but I am not so sure. When I see millions ﬂock
like lemmings to IQ-irnpaired Adam Sandler
movies, I am tempted to concede that they
might have a point. But could a television pro-
gram as gripping as “ER,” with deep, compli-
cated characters, have been made during an era
when network censors bitterly fought to allow
the word “pregnant” to be uttered on “I Love
Lucy”? Somehow, I doubt it.

It’s odd that Hollywood would make two
intelligent ﬁlms about how we perceive reality
— “Pleasantville” and “The Truman Show” —
in the same year. Imagine that! Movies that
actually inspire you to ask hard questions about
the world in which you live and the way in
which you perceive it. What I ﬁnd particularly
intriguing about “Pleasantville” is how skillful-
ly it deconstructs a myth about a time that never
was. Forty years from now, people might have
fond memories of the 1990s. I hope then that
there are people willing to question this percep-
tion of reality and ask some hard questions
about the time in which they live.

Michael Berquist was pleasantly surprised that 
Hollywood actually made a movie that had 1

some intelligence.

   
    

Thanksgiving
weekend and
Pittsburgh sports

First of all, welcome back, and I hope
you all had a wonderful holiday.

Being omniscient, I already know that
anyone who is a fan of our basketball
teams had a pleasurable Thanksgiving,
much like I did.

Here are random thoughts and stories
from my weekend:

When Pitt beat up on Xavier and qui-
eted all those UK fans in Puerto Rico, I
couldn’t help but chuckle. Pat, the sports
editor of The Pitt News, and I had a dis-
cussion before the break about whether we
thought the Panthers were good enough to
make the NCAA Tournament. We con-
cluded, to our surprise, that they were.

Even coach Ralph Wiﬂaid couldn’t
have expected the results the Panthers had
this past weekend.

I gave thanks to my family for having
our Thanksgiving dinner at 3:30 p.m. The
Steelers game was on in my house as we
ate and was quickly shut off when they
lost.

Eating quickly, I went to my cold
basement and watched the Panthers easily
dispose of the Musketeers frorri Xavier,
scoring 94 points. When I learned Pitt
would play Kentucky the following mom-
ing, I was ecstatic.

Waking up at 10:30 a.m. on a day off,
I again found myself in the chilling realms
of my dungeon, watching the Panthers
handle the fomth best team in the nation
with relative ease.

OK, so after that, my holiday week-
end was honible. Our football team gave
up two fewer points to West Virginia than
our basketball team did to Kentucky. The
debacle that occurred the following
evening in Puerto Rico did little to bright-
en my spirits as Christmas music took
over the nation’s radio waves.

One of the first things I did after
watching the Panthers get destroyed by
Maryland was ﬁnd out who they were
playing next.

Then came the sigh of relief.

Prairie View A&M!

It is critical to the success of the team
that the players respond well to losing
their first game of the year. Winning is the
best way to teach younger players how to
win.

I know. “That’s a real Harvard state-
ment, Brad.”

Look at it this way. The Fred
Piimuses and the Chris Seabrookses of the
basketball world would be accustomed to
winning ball games instead of losing them

When a wrestling team loses 110
wins from the previous year, that’s the
first sign the upcoming season will be
dubbed “a rebuilding year.”

That’s the situation the Pitt
wrestling team faces this season. Three-
time All-Americans John Withrow and
Mark Bodo have graduated, taking
their 61 wins with them.

Jake Schaus, a two-time NCAA
qualiﬁer, transferred to the University
of Buffalo, taking 16 more wins away
from the Panther lineup.

“Those are guys we’re going to
miss, guys we'll have trouble replac-
ing,” said head coach Rande
Stottlemyer.

Realizing it would be difficult to
replace those grapplers, Stottlemyer
decided to redshirt another of his
team’s best athletes, Rob Loper, who

has a 61-18 record in his first two years?

as a Panther.

Stottlemyer will also redshirt the
majority of his recruiting class, which
includes 15 wrestlers. The idea of red-
shirting Loper and the freshmen is to

save a year of eli-
gibility so they
can make future
teams legitimate
national con-
tenders.

But for a
wrestling pro-
gram as strong as
the Panthers,’
even a rebuilding
year could mean
finishing among
the nation’s top
30 — something
they’ve done in
12 of the past 14
years.

“That’s why you don’t mail in the
results,” Stottlemyer said. “On paper
we don’t have the team we did last year,
but you never know. If the right guys
step up, there’s always a chance you
can surprise some people.”

Here’s a look at the 1998-99 lineup:

125 - Brian Legarth gets the starting
nod. He was the prize recruit of the
1997 recruiting class and gained some
valuable experience last year as a true

freshman, picking up 13 wins in limit-
ed action. Christopher Neu and Zach
Hasse will be the primary backups.

133 - As the primary starter at 118 last
year, Shawn Arnistade comes into the
season with more experience than most

sophomores. With that year of experi-

ence under his belt, he should improve
on his 10-17 record from last year.

WVU dominates the Backyard Brawl, 52-14

Patrick Robertson

Sports Editor

The Backyard Brawl resembled a
good old-fashioned butt—kickin’ by the
Mountaineers.

Pitt’s football season came to an end
Friday with a 52-14 drubbing at the
hands of West Virginia.

The Panthers ended the season with
a 2-9 record and no hopes of a bowl
game. WVU ﬁnished 8-3 and is await-
ing a bowl bid. -

The first quarter looked promising
for the Panthers except for one play. On
the first offensive play of the game,
WVU quarterback Marc Bulger riﬂed a
pass to Shawn Foreman, who was tack-
led by Tray Crayton and Seth Homack.

Crayton lay motionless on the ﬁeld
for a moment before stirring a little.
Trainers and doctors rushed onto the
ﬁeld, along with coach Walt Harris.
Crayton had some numbness in his arms
and was taken off the ﬁeld on a stretch-
er. He was transported to the hospital.

Crayton underwent an MRI and
regained feeling in his arms. He
returned to Three Rivers Stadium and
joined his team in the locker room after

the game.

Bulger enjoyed his 13th straight
game with a touchdown pass, his 15th
career two- touchdown game, and a
career—high six touchdown passes. His
3,034 yards make him the only quarter-
back in Mountaineer history to throw for
more than 3,000 yards in a season.

“The guys didn’t play like we
coached them to play. We fought, but we
just didn’t have enough,” Harris said.

West Virginia’s potent offense was
held at bay until 1:05 in the ﬁrst quarter.
Pitt’s defense held All-Big East running
back Amos Zereoue in check in the ﬁrst
quarter.

The Mountaineers ﬁnally put some
points on the board with a 38-yard ﬁeld
goal by Jay Taylor.

After this drive, Harris tried to
jump-start the ﬂoundering Panthers by
inserting backup quarterback Matt
O’Connor.

The junior-college transfer ran three
plays before throwing an interception to
WVU junior safety Gary Thompkins.

Two drives later, WVU scored a
touchdown on a 24-yard pass from
Bulger to Khori Ivy.

On the next Pitt possession, Matt

Lytle returned to take control, but Pitt
missed a 44-yard ﬁeld-goal attempt.

With good field position, the
Mountaineers drove down the field and
scored on a pass from Bulger to David
Sauders.

Pitt kept it a game in the next series,
when Kevan Barlow stumbled, spun,
and ran his way into the end zone to cut
WVU’s lead to 17-7.

But after another Bulger touchdown
pass, WVU blocked a Pitt punt and ran
it back for a touchdown, leaving the
score 31-7 at halftime.

Harris credited his team’s poor play
to “losing previous games and previous
years.”

He felt his team did not expect to
win or know how to win.

Bulger’s touchdown passes to Mark
Corman and Foreman ran the score up to
45-7. '

Harris inserted O’Connor again, but

the game was out of reach. Pitt’s Amirl

Purifoy added a 17-yard interception
return for a late touchdown, but Pitt
dropped the game, 52-14.

After the game, Harris summed up
the season by saying, “I pray we don’t
ever have to go through this ever again.”

Asslstant Sports Editor

The rebuilding Panther wrestling
team saw its first action of the season
this weekend, finishing seventh out
of 12 teams at the Mat Town
Invitational, held at Lock Haven
University.

“We’re a young team, and we
wrestled young,” explained assistant
coach Ed Palmer. “For a lot of our
guys, it was their first ever [varsity]
college wrestling matches.”

On such a young team, it’s not
surprising that the Pitt grappler with
the most success was Chad Jesko, the
wrestler with the most experience.

Jesko, a senior, finished second
in the 149-pound weight class. He
rolled through Hofstra’s James
Scanlon, Bucknell’s Ben Chunko and
Slippery Rock’s Chris Elliot with a
combined score of 30-5 before drop-
ping a 5-2 decision to nationally
ranked Jamarr Billman of Penn State
in the final round.

“I was happy with the way I
wrestled, but there’s always room for
improvement,” Jesko said.

Pitt competed without Nick
Mengerink, a wrestler who many feel

depth.

141 - This is one of the most wide-open
weight classes in Pitt’s lineup. True
freshman Chris Digiuseppe is the
starter right now, but he missed this
weekend’s tournament with an ankle
injury, so fellow freshman Andy
Villeco wrestled. Senior Ben Dings
could also see a lot of action.

149 - Chad Jesko comes into his senior
season with a starting spot locked at
149. The three-time NCAA qualiﬁer
put together an impressive 29-11 record
last year and should be a national
power.

“Jesko is going to be one of the top
kids in the country, mark my words,”
said Pitt assistant coach Ed Palmer. “He
wrestled the number-two kid in the
country [Penn State’s Jamarr Billman]
as close as anybody.”

157 - The Pitt coaches are counting
heavily on junior Mike Ziska to help
fill the void left by last season’s depar-
tures. Ziska qualiﬁed for the NCAA
tournament last year, and that experi-
ence will be invaluable on Pitt’s young
team. Mike Dixon, a former starter,
provides quality depth at this weight
class.

165 - Senior Brian Pardini beat out fel-

has a shot at the national champi-
onship this season. Mengerink
missed the tournament with an
injured hand but should return to
action by the end of the month.

Pitt had place winners in eight of
the 10 weight classes.

Senior Kevin Johnson finished
fifth at the 174-pound weight class,
while impressive freshman Dan
Stine placed fifth at 197.

Sophomore 125—pounder Brian
Legarth and junior heavyweight Matt
Mueller finished sixth in their
respective weight classes.

Seyenth-place finishers for Pitt
included freshman Andy Villecdo

‘and junior Mike Ziska at the 141-

pound and 157-pound weight class-
es.

Junior Brad Wood rounded out
the Panther place winners, finishing
eighth at 184.

“We’re not wrestling the way we
want to yet, but we will get there,”
Palmer said.

This weekend, Pitt will compete
in the Las Vegas Invitational before
returning home for its first dual meet
of the season, which will be next
Thursday night against Bloomsburg.

low senior Kevin Johnson to make 165
one of the most experienced weight
classes on an inexperienced team. Both
should see plenty of action.

174 - Pitt boasts one of the nation’s top
wrestlers in Nick Mengerink, making
174 the team’s strongest weight class.
Mengerink went 34-4 as a freshman
last season, and he picked up All-
American and EWL Freshman of the
Year Honors. He comes into the season
ranked third in the nation.

184 - This is Pitt’s other wide-open
weight class. Junior Brad Wood cap-
tured the starting spot and wrestled
well in the team’s first tournament.
Dave Galati, Pat Bainbridge, Jake
Nelson and Josh McCollough could all
see mat time.

197 - Freshman Dan Stein comes to Pitt
as one of the nation’s top recruits and
has immediately claimed the starting
spot at 197. His talent is unquestion-
able, but — similar to the rest of the
team — inexperience could be an issue.
Fellow freshman Aaron Bibro provides
depth.

Heavyweight - It appears this will be
the year Matt Mueller will realize his
enormous potential. He is a 250-
pounder with incredible athletic ability
who could be a force at heavyweight.
Sean Barkey will be the backup heavy-

weight.

Wﬂlard can show game ﬁlms until all the
players’ eyes fall out. He can also run drills
until everyone gets hurt in practice, a com-
mon occurrence here.

But the best teacher is experience.
Next year, when Vonteego Cimimings is
playing basketball professionally, the
Panthers will know what it feels like to
win, and they won’t want to lose. They
will get discouraged when they lose.

And not just the “Oh, damn, we lost to
Temple” response. Instead, the players
will get ﬁred up, not wanting to lose anoth-
er game.

It’s the same way in academics. In
high school, a good student (notice I didn’t
say excellent) earns A’s and B’s. When this
same good student goes to college, the
classes are tougher, and he or she doesn’t
do as well on a test, getting a C. The stu-
dent is livid, ripping papers and tossing
whatever is in his or her reach. This is fol-
lowed by the “I suck,” which is repeated to
each and every person on the person’s
domi ﬂoor.

So not every student reacts like I do.
Be grateful.

For the next test, the student puts forth
more effort, knowing what is needed to
succeed, and again earns A’s and B’s.

The basketball team needs to do the
same thing. Vifith big road tests against
Tennessee and St. John’s coming in the
next week, it’s essential to destroy Prairie

TH: Prrr News

You don’t beat teams like Prairie View
when you’re in the top 25. You smack ‘em
around a bit. You show them why coaches
and writers across the nation named you
the 20th best team. You light them up for a
115-53 drubbing.

I’m not forgetting about the women’s
team, either.

At 4-0, it has already defeated the
likes of Penn State, which should be music
to Pitt students’ ears. The Lady Panthers
should not be content with such a good
start, and having talked with head coach
Traci Waites, I know they will not be con-
ceding anything.

I now return to my discussion with
Pat. Something tells us that Pitt will be
announced when CBS and ESPN do their
basketball tournament selection shows
sometime in mid-March.

I can only hope we are not one of
those “bubble teams” left out because
against Seton Hall, one of our cheerleaders
failed to execute a back ﬂip, and we didn’t
respond well enough to win.

It’s all about responding when faced
with a loss. When you brush yourself off
and get back up from the fall, ready and
willing, you know you’re better than good.

So, I’m glad you had a good
Thanksgiving. Now get off of your ass,
and work that extra piece of pumpkin pie
out of your system.

Vonteego Cummings led the team
with 24 points. Attila Cosby and Isaac
Hawkins both racked up double doubles.

Hawkins registered 19 points and 12
rebounds, while Cosby had 23 points and
12 rebounds.

Friday’s round-two game featured the
Panthers meeting the defending National
Champion Kentucky Wildcats. Pitt
jumped on the Wildcats early and did not
let up. _

The Panthers went into the locker

room with a 31-25 lead, shooting 50 per-’ ,

cent ﬁom behind the are compared "to
Kentucky’s 10 percent.

Crmimings and Hawkins were the
only Panthers in double ﬁgures, with 20
and 10 points respectively.

The victory upped the team’s season
record to 6-0 and set up a match against
ﬁfth-ranked Maryland in the tournament
ﬁnals.

But the fatigue of the three-day tour-
nament caught up with Pitt as Maryland
showed why it is a national power.

Maryland jumped out to a dominat-
ing 46-17 ﬁrst-half lead before continuing
the romp in the second half to ﬁnish with
a commanding 87-52 win.

Maryland forward Laron Proﬁt was

1995, Williams reached his record
yardage on 1,011 attempts and aver-
aged 6.2 yards per carry. But what is
most interesting is the fact that
Williams had to wait until his last reg-
ular season to capture the record.

The record~setting day came
against the Texas A&M defense, which
was ranked No. 2 in the nation coming
into the game. The Aggies entered the
game allowing 250.8 yards per game.
Williams ground out that much
yardage himself. In carrying the ball 44
times, Williams rushed for 259 yards,
giving him 2,124 yards in his senior
season.

Williams now holds the following
Division I-A rushing records: career
rushing touchdowns (72), total career
touchdowns (75), career points scored
overall (452), games with a touchdown
(33), and games with two or more
touchdowns (21). He also became the
only person in history to rush for con-
secutive 300-yard games when he
gained 318 yards against Rice and-350
against Iowa State.

Despite the accomplishments, the
debate continues as to whether Dorsett
or Williams is the best Division I-A
running back of all time. Dorsett was
on the sidelines to see Williams break
his record and said it couldn’t have
happened to a better guy.
