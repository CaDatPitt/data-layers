Charles H. Ebert. director of
the Placement bureau, disclosed
that according to a survey of the
causes of job ‘dismissals, the ma-
jority oi the cases are not for
lack of skill or training required
by the position. The study was
made recently by -76 large corpor-
ations..

Mr. Ebert continued, “This
should serve as a guide to veter-
ans in school today. It seems that
veterans have a tendency to con-
centrate on one branch 01‘ learn-
ing without full consideration-»for
a well—rounded background. Get-
ting the degree that will enable
the student to ﬁll a job seems to
be the main ambition.”

Mr. Ebert added, “The survey
shows that of the 76 "corporations
studied,-only 10.1 per cent ofall
dismissals were "lack of training
or skill; yet 89.9 per cent‘ were
because of undesirable character
traits.” . ,

In other words, getting along in
college seems. to mean that the
average graduate will get along
well in a future job. A well round-
ed background is needed rather
than over concentration , on spe-
cialization. Some of the most com-
mon undesirable traits listed in
the survey were: carelessness,
laziness, lack of initiative,» and
lack of ambition and loyalty.

Vets Ass’n
Gains Formal
Recognition

Pitt’s Veterans association
moved toward more substantial
footing early this month when
Stuart Workmaster, association
president, announced formal rec-
ognition for the group by the
Committee of Student activities.

tion was made known on April 8
in a letter to Workmaster from
William F. Saalbach, assistant to
the dean of men, following the
required year of probation for new
activities groups on campus.

, Recognition for the group cli-
maxes a year of social activity
and organized efforts to solve
problems facing vets and the stu-
dent body in general. ‘

Swinging into college activity
last October, the Vets presented
their first dance of. the school
year, the Pigskin Hop, at the
Mosque.

.Turning to pertinent student
issues, the Vets discussed all
phases of the housing situation
in an attempt to bring a federal
housing set-up to the Pitt cam-
pus.  ; '3 . J 

Another battle came when Pitt
vets, backed by a petition signed
by over 3000 students, campaigned
for streetcar passes. Regardless of
the petition‘ and the series of
meetings and discussions, Pitts-
burgh Railways ruled that “giv-
ing veterans st.re‘etcar passes is
discrimination." . ’ '

In the past few years—no, in the past‘ few months, we
have been ‘witnesses to an evolution whether we know it or not.
The old-school grind has bored deeper into nights, and every
“day’s activities have been ampliﬁed to the point of rotating
-in the inevitable circle. But this madly rotating circle is What
’_ We have been griping for for the whole year. A

Perhaps this evolution started with the successful foot-
ball season. The students did their part; they cheered enthus-
, iastically, trekked up the hill, and stood like a fortress behind
the team. Congratulations! -

Cap and Gown sparked enthusiasm into the newly-returned
organization. The students had backed them. Congratulations!

Registration in February struck’ us with awed unbelief—
we found’ we could register rapidly under a new plan. There
was student -cooperation. Congratulations! '

,. 4‘ kitt Players were the talk of the school ,wit_h their hilar-
S ious production, “Room Service.” See, the students enjoyed
the e-ntertafnment, and quickly got into the swing of the affair.
Congratulations! - ‘ . ’ . .

Da.nces——freshma.n, sophomore, and junior—diverted stu-
dent minds from the book routine,‘ and they gladly attended.
Student-Congress arranged tea dances, and the ,Mosque rang
with the pleasures of students. Congratulations!

Elections, in almost every campus organization, drew the
student into the ring of participation, and he did it gratefully.
Now he was really in the swing. Congratulations! ‘

A quick check of the activities on the spring schedule

:— shows us that we will be kept busy. Spring Festival, Memorial
ball, Milit'a.ry ball‘, individual organization dances, ﬁnal meet-
ings, and banquets of groups, clubs, fraternities, etc., will be
an integral part of the remaining seven weeks of school. This
weisknow, because the student body has shown before that they

A , want and will support these activities. .

The attendance, attitude, and the amount of participation
in the past have proved this. _

Don’.t let any faction, either within or outside the Uni-
versity, rebuke you for lack of interest in Pitt. Show him the
record for the year; compare it with. other schools this size,
and tell him of your participation in school activities this year.

Please accept a co-ngr,atulatory hand of-praise and .thanks.

Almost despairing of any show

to the cause of freshmen advance-

in the future, more orientation
time be devoted to the discussion
of" famous men who’ve graduat-

pletion of the building.

We were stumped by the ﬁrst
choice query but, gazing at the
walls of our ofﬁce ﬁnished in the
decor of an early American gar-
age, we awarded the frosh the
symbolic lantern for constructive
criticism for the second.

cent IF-Faculty Open House.
Dear Mr. Peterson:

1 9.4 7 , Interfraternity council
invited faculty and administrative
members and their familiesto at-
tend open ‘house atthe fraternity
houses of the University. 
purpose in extending this invita-
tion was to promote a closer per-
sonal relationship between fra-
trnity men and their professors.

the University,
cently,-because of the overcrowd-
ed classes, both faculty and stu-
dents alike have expressed, the

‘need for a_ closer relationship. An

open house, where they might
meet and. mix informally, seemed
to be the answer. 
Interfraternity Council decide
on /a Sunday date because of the
irregular class_ schedules of ’ the

though the fraternities exerted
considerable time and effort in
preparation for this event, only
20 members of- the‘ faculty and
administration, or about 1%, indi-
cated enough interest to, attend. _

A This presents a problem that In-
terfraternity council‘ frankly does

not know how to solve. We are

still interested in creating -a more
personal relationship between the
two groups. Since our cﬁrst attempt
failed, we would appreciate’ now
the advice or iassistance of your
committee in this matter.

Very sincerely yours,

FRIDAY, APRIL 25, 1947

by Abby Clark and Jim Ludwig

We’ve decided that some rec-
ognition should be given to those

‘fraternities displaying the best
"type

of interfraternalism. So,
this week the gold stars go to the
Phi Eps and the Pi Lams whose

 ofﬁcers got together the other day
,and ironed out all past difficul-

ties between the two fraternities.

‘We think this is a step in the
j right direction.

The Tri Delts claim a Regional

~ Tech, Penn State, Bucknell, Penn,
.William and Mary, Randolph Ma-

,‘con, and the Uni, of Maryland.

Incidentally. the SAE’s had a nice
tea_dance for the ADPi’s the other
day.

“Nothing like a little jaunt to
Penn State,” so say the Delta
Zelta’s of Pennsylvania. May 31
is the day, and the event is a
grand reunion of actives and
alums.

The Phi Eps made the Webster
Hall their home away from home
to their parents last Sunday as
they treated them with a very
enjoyable reception. Ah, why kid
around———it was a dull affair, but
a nice gesture.

Next week is a highlight in Chi
O pledge, Muriel Thompson’s life.
An audition for radio at the Arts
and Crafts center is the cause for
excitement, and we bet all her
sorority sisters will be there in
the ﬁrst row.

The Sigma Chi’s chalk up two
more social aﬁairs on their cal-
endar. April 28 they play hosts to
the ADPi’s and May 24 they hon-
or some lucky gal as their “Sweet-

Dances galore for the Theta’s!
Last Mondaygit was a dance for

will play hostess to the Delts.

A DELIGHTFUL DINNER?

F o u r t e e n brunettes ﬂoated
about inside tremulous bubbles
blown up by publicity men and
an unlimited expense account.

On Easter Sunday I loosened
my grip on those gilt—edged clouds
called glamour and went to the
Sunrise Services at the Hollywood
Bowl. This, I was told, was‘a
reverent tribute by Hollywood to
that great holy day. It was slight-

fly tainted for me by the obvious, :

interest of both tourist and Glen-
dale residents in how many
“celebs” they could point out.

After rolling Easter eggs and
meeting more stars at Hope’s
home Sunday evening, the ‘four-.
teen bruns went to Ken Mur-
rayis “Blackouts,” starring Mur-
ray and Marie Wilson. This crazy
laff show has been running out
there for ﬁveyears.

Monday and Tuesday we climb-
ed back on the plush cushion.

Our split-second schedule some-
times made it necessary to travel
under a police escort with siren
going full blast. (It was with dif-
ﬁculty that publicity me;- were
kept from smothering those ﬁve
limousines, our “giddy—cars” for
the week, in forty-foot banners

to‘ get into the movies.

More of playing Movie Star for
a" minute. Our‘ personal appear-
ances ranged from the “Bride and
Groom” through “Breakfast in
Hollywood” to the Lux Theater
and Hope’s show.

Before we left Hollywood we;

visited Westmore’s beauty salon,
Which has a mild cosmetic con-
cession on the Paramount lot. We

were made up and hair—styled as »

though we were shooting that
very afternoon.

End of stay, Variety called it
truly a powerful stunt,
And sitting up the train track a

- few hundred miles was the most

fabulous train wreck that had
fallen into any gag man’s lap.
The Santa Fe Super Chief. Best
story of the year. Dolly sister and
Hope’s brun‘ aboard. So important
to the railroad that an alert pho‘-,
tographer, taking pictures ﬁve

minutes after the wreck, was of-

fered $1500 to~suppress one roll
of ﬁlm.

It wasn’t just publicity that re-
ported those girls helping the in-
jured passengers. They were the
calmest people on the train . . .
even when some of our party took
off the velvet mittens they had
been wearing and became hyster-
ical.

FRIDAY, APRIL 25, 1947

/1’/udical $/alei

By Jerry Newberg

Nite Club

Rounding off their second week
at the Ankara out there on route
51 is the ﬁne talent of the Joe
Mooney quartette. The quartette
consists of Joe Mooney (piano or
accordian), Gate Frega (bass),
Andy Fritzgerald (clarinet and
sax), and Jack Hotop (guitar).
Mooney does the arranging, writes
many of the tunes and sings the
vocals in the soft style of Nat
“King” Cole. Sometimes Mooney
switches from the piano to the
accordian an.d believe me, broth-
er, no one can swing an accordian
like Mooney. 

The quartette gives with a new
_brand of jazz that’s' quiet—even
the old-school parents can enjoy
these wonderful arrangements.
Aside from its good music, the
quartette also entertains humor-
ously with hooked-up versions of
standards. If you want a sample
of Mooney’s works just drop in-
to a record shop and ask for his
latest Decca releases.

Wax Wise "

This 'weeks favorite album is
Lionel Hampton’s latest Decca re-
lease. It’s strictly for the boogie-
lovers. It gives Hampton at his
best, Hampton with his bubbling
vitality, the kind of music that
makes you ﬁnd yourself ridin’
along with the beat. The album.
contains Hamp’s most effervescent
boogie woogie compos; “Hamp’s
Boogie Woogie,” “Flying Home,”
“Hey Ba-Ba—Re—Bop” and others.

Kenton has come through with
another. This time it’s cute June
Christy giving with the Indian
boogie rhythm as she tells us
what is going on “Across The Al-
ley From The Alamo.” The ﬂip-
over with the Pastels vocalizing
on “There Is No Greater Love”
isn’t up to the Kenton par . . .
Andy and Della_ Russell sing to-
gether for the ﬁrst time on Capi-
tol’s- waxing of “Unless It -Can
Happen To You,” and on the
turnover Andy tells us, in his
,romantic voice, that “Dreams Are
At Dime _A Dozen.” The instru-
mental work is capable and the
singing per usual is sure-ﬁre.

If it’s a novelty song you are
looking for you can’t help but en-
joy the dynamic vocal ability of
Phil Harris as he whips up a
whimsical picture of a youngster
hitting his {stride in gay Paree.
The name of the tune is “Poppa
Don’t Preach To Me.” On the back
is “Necessity," the hit tune from
the Broadway Musical “Finian’s
Rainbow,” also treated in Phi1’s
genial manner . . . Coming up
fast is the Goodman-Mercer hit on
Capitol titled “Moonfaced and
Starryeyed“‘ and “It Takes Time.”
Both are hit tunes that you’ll be
sure to go for. Take a listen and
see for yourself.

All School of Education sen-
iors must have a Graduate Rec-
ord examination before gradu-
ation unless they have taken
them as sophomores. Arrange-
ments should be made with Dr.
Dietze in 1617 C1.

Carlson Stresses Three Factors

cavorted on the hardwood for the ﬁrst time last Monday.

Holdover varsitymen, Bill Ciep-9
ly, Ed Latagliata, and Sammy
David, plus a host of promising
jayvee and February freshmen
were shown the numerous possi-
bilities of the hidden ball tech-
nique, employed in the pivot slot.

Much stress was placed on the

Pitt Trackmen

In Penn Relays

Carl Olson leads his cindermen
into Franklin’ ﬁeld this afternoon
for the 5-3rd running of the Penn
Relays. Hampered by inactivity
during the indoor season, the Pan-
thers are a-cc-orded a ﬁne chance
of scoring heavily in the sprints.

The Panther 5440-yard relay
team composed of Herb Douglas,
Clarence Doak, and Bill Morton
are expected to provide stiff op-
position for Illinois, N.Y.U. and
Ohio State. '

Carr Should Score’
Tommy Carr who racked up
a 9.7_ second 100-yard dash at Mt.

Lebanon high school should score
heavily in the century event. The
sprint—medley introduces Johnny
Wilson who will run the crucial
880-yard leg. Johnny turned in a
1:58 half-mile at Overbroook high
school in Philadelphia.

Doak carries the baton in the
440-yard leg while the two 220-
yard legs will be run by either
Carr and Douglas or Morton and
Gene Heide. . '

A, In the specialtwo-mile run, Ed

Sudzina comes up against an old
rival in Penn Sfate’s Curtis Stone.

Eddie O’Too1e of Manhattan.

Th‘e,,Pirates aren’t the only hot team in town.

Ralph ,Mit.terli'ngg’s Jungle Cats ha.ve clawed their way to
three straight victories, smackinga total of 33 hits. ,

From" all outward appearances, the Panthers face the
pleasant prospect of compiling one of P_itt’s ﬁnest baseball
records in many a season. California Teachers, Salem, and

West Virginia have fallen victim¢
‘to the potent bats of the Pitt nine,
and tomorrow Juniata will play

host to the Panthers.

The Indianspmay offer a regir-

Their pitching staff has looked
razor sharp on occasions this year.
Either Dick Frick or Tom Kyper
will handle the pitching chores.

Coach Mitterling, whose pitch-

ing staff has been operating on a

a shot in the arm‘ when Deryl

against West Virginia, allowing a
