Abduction

Police at No. 4 Station in Oak-
land report no further progress to-
wards tracking down the abductor
of Graduate Nurse Marjorie Weller,
a senior in the School of Public
Nprsing last Wednesday night.

Mrs. Weller was forced into a
wild ride through Oakland, Schen-
ley Park, Herron Hill and Bloom-
field by an unidentified attacker
after she returned to her car from
a night class at McGee Hospital.
During the ride she fought off the
advances of the man, described as
about 20, blond, tall, and powerfully
built.

For more than an hour the thug
held Mrs. Weller at gun point. She
finally leaped from the car and
escaped when it slowed for a red
light at Liberty Avenue and S.
Mathilda St. ,

The man, hatless and wearing a
blue suit, pushed the pistol into’
Mrs. Weller’s back as she unlocked
the door of her car.

Forcing her to get in, then seat-
ing himself beside her, he drove
off, keeping the gun free in one
hand. When Mrs. Weller screamed
he tightened her scarf around her
throat.’

She offered him the four dollars
she had in her purse to let her go.

He refused the money then but
later took it. To keep her from
screaming, the thug threatened

continually to "wreck the _car and
then we’ll both get hurt.”

This attack marks the second
University affiliate to be brought
into the police headlines recently.
On Dec. 14, 1949, Mrs. Ruth
Knight, a University employee, was
shot and wounded by a robber.

Mrs. Weller is the widow of Jos-
eph Weller who was killed in ser-
vice with the air force. She is the
mother of a five year old son.

Liberal Frat

, Recognized  

By LARRY HERLICK
Kappa.Beta Phi, the only non-

sectarian fraternity on campus,
was recognized as a university
organization last week, it was

announced by Dean of Men Theo-
dore Biddle. Dean Biddle is chair-
man of the Pitt fraternity Committee,
a board of faculty members, which
must approve all fraternity and
sorority organizations on campus.

Kappa Beta Phi, a local frat,
was organized last year by a group
of nine men of all faiths on a non-
sectarian basis. The fraternity now
boasts of 25’ members and three
alumni. President of the organiza-
tion is Aron Stein.

Meanwhile, another victory against

sectarianism in fraternities was
reported. Jack Grodin, president
of Kappa Nu, revealed that the

recent national convention of the
frat had amended the previous sec-
tarian clause of the frat.

Have Stayed Open,

Congressmen Say      

.a'’_

By ED KLOTZ ‘ ,

The "closed door” session of Student Congress last

did not do any good and it was not necessary, a majority of Con-

gress members concurred when questioned over the week-end,   in
Several of the student legislators insisted that ‘it was notan 

unethical move, however. If conditions are such that secrecy is *

essential for the welfare of a program then a closed meeting. is 

justified, they said.

This was the consensus of opinion concerning the Jan. 9 meet-{Q
ing during which Congress ejected two guests and the News '‘re- ; 1
porter in order to hear a committee ‘report privately. I ’

Carol Nunes, Faculty Rating Com- A

mittee chairman, requested that the
meeting be closed during her report.
She claimed a misquote in the Dec.
2 issue of the News "got her in
trouble.”

Although no reporter was present
during the closed portion of the
meeting, Dick Kovar stated after
the close of the session that Miss
Nunes requested she be relieved
of the committee chairmanship and
the committee be dissolved.

“She wanted to work toward an
eventual faculty-administered pro-
gram,” Kovar said.

Howard Greenberger, Men’s Coun-
cil representative to Congress and
the one who was allegedly mis-
quoted, proposed the motion which
barred Jack Lindsey, an unidenti-
fied young woman, and the reporter
during the 45 minute delivery of
the FRP report.

"Looking back, the motion did
not do any good. At the time I
thought Carol (Nunes) had some-
thing important which, if released
prematurely, might endanger the
program," Greenberger said.

"Congress did not do wrong,” he
emphasized. “And I did not talk to
her (Miss Nunes) before the meeting
and it (the closed session) was
not prearranged.”

Flora Diemert, president of Con-
gress, when questioned if she had
planned to exclude the guests be-
fore the meeting, emphatically de-
nied it. "I was thinking of a closed
meeting for another matter but not
the FRP report,” she said.

Miss Nunes said, "I didn't real-
ize the trouble it would cause.When
I asked for a closed meeting, I
merely thought that the discussions
of the various Congressmen would
not be printed but that the results
would. .

"I never expected the reporter or
the others to go.I’ve never attended
a meeting where any one was asked
to leave.”

First Fireside

Chat of ’SO

Scheduled for Tomorrow

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
will be host to a small group of stu-
dents in his first floor office to-
morrow for the first fireside chat
of the new year.

This limited group of students
have been chosen from the first
signatures of men and women who
signed up for the gathering either
Friday or Monday at the Student
Desk. Senior Court, sponsor of the
fireside chats, contactedthese stu-
dents by phone to give them a for-
mal invitation.

In the past, students were selected
by invitation alone; but to make the
gathering more democratic and to
give all students who wished to at-
tend an opportunity, Senior Court
has innovated the above system.

As annual events on campus,
these informal talks with the Chan-
cellor are arranged by Senior Court
of WSGA to give students an oppor-
tunity to meet and talk with a busy

January is a little early to expect anyone to do much thinking

about spring student elections, the annual game in which a hand-
ful of unsupported independents holding a pair of deuces try to
outdraw the full house of the fraternities.
Consequently, we viewed with surprise and pleasure last
«week legislation introduced in Student Congress and Men's Coun-
cil,‘which would correct a flaw in the election procedure. This
refers to the evil of dual office-holding, that is, one person hold-

government bodie s.

7 ing or even running for seats in two of the school's three student

We propounded upon this weakness in the constitutions of
these organizations early in the semester as the basic cause
which led to disheartening "resigning rut” that was marking the
meetings of these groups at that time. But we expected to secure
little support, no matter how self-evident the flaw appeared, from
those already in offices who could, if opportunity presented itself

take advantage of the weakness.

What we -heard after that editorial opinion appeared bore out
our suspicions. Congressional leaders, many of whom were guilty
of this practice, defended themselves and the utilization of this
procedure to gain double positions in student government. They
insisted not only that they could handle two posts effectively,

- despite the rebutting evidence of frequent resignations from Con-
gress and Council, but also that they had to sit in two legislative

chairs.
it an I:

*t*

They maintained that there weren't more than a few persons
outside these bodies who wanted or deserved to be on the inside,
which we feel, if true, is only true because they are denied the
opportunity to enter the field for a combination of reasons, one of
the most important of which is the absence of a dual office-hold-
ership proviso in the constitutions.

Men’s Council stands today on the threshold of wiping the
error from its constitution. Jim Morton’s amendments, including
one, to eliminate dual office-holding, seems sure of receiving
Council's approval at today's session.

Student Congress,unfortunatel.y, didn’t take the same sensible
attitude toward a similar measure introduced a week ago Monday
by Dick Campbell. Congress refused to take action on it. Nor has
anything been forthcoming from WSGA, the female counterpart to

_ Council. In that case the measure doesn’t so aptly apply, for the

proportionately small population of coeds attending school makes

it less of a fault.

Council alone, however, can resolve the issue and show up
it's mistaken upper house merely by passing Morton’s amendment.
For‘, by ‘restricting its membership from running for or holding a
seat on’ Congress synonomously with membership on Council, it

obviously forces the provision on the unwilling new

members

and candidates for SC, despite their opposition to the procedure.

 ' By ALLAN BIERMAN

This is the second in a series by Mr. Bierman concerning
/V./en’s Council proposal to make over room 817 into a men’s

recreational lounge.

Now that Men's Council has de-
cided to take the matter of using
room 817 as a game room rather
than a rehearsal and class room
to Chancellor Fitzgerald, I would
like to ask one question. The ques-
tion is directed toward Roy Nelson
(nothing personal), head of the
committee that drew up the letter
that was sent to the Chancellor.

The question is, "Mr. Nelson,
Why room 817?” True, it is on the
men's floor, but then so is the Pitt
News, Owl, Panther and the Dean

. of Men's office. The activities car-

ried on in 817 are just as import-
tant as those carried on in these
other rooms, so why pick on 817,
the only place the band can call

‘ "home.”

It certainly would be much easier
to move a few card tables to an-

. other room, that is if one can be

‘found, than it would be to move

$45,000 worth of instruments and
cases plus a grand piano, a record
player ‘and more than 100 chairs.

Of course,the card players on the
eighth floor could take over as
recreational lounges any of the
previously named places and have
the present occupants move into
the hall.

This would indeed present a
liberal education to anyone who
happens to wander onto the eighth
floor. He could watch a newspaper,
a magazine and a yearbook in pro-
duction. He could also watch the
secretaries from the Dean of Men's
office (worth watching). He might
stumble into a band rehearsal and
be trampled under the high-step-
ping feet of the Varsity Marching
Band. He might even be able to
catch a ‘down’ elevator.

So once again I ask, "Mr. Nelson,
Why room 817?” ,

   

Open Sesame

By DICK KOVAR
Pitt News ‘Managing Editor

Every time someone mentions ‘Student Congress’ on this page '

the readers get set for an analysis of just what that body has or
hasn’t done and what should be done about it. And, to some ex-

tent, this piece is no exception.

Certainly, the publicity Congress
has received this year, as in former
years, hasn't been ofthe most com-
plimentary sort. Congress members
complain that the important and

0verset

praiseworthy legislation carried
out is ignored or submerged by the
News, which is the only medium
through which the average student
hears about the legislator’s actions.

By BILL SCRIVO

Pitt News News Editor

In the current issue of Pageant magazine is an article which
the writer of this column thinks should be brought to the atten-
tion of Pitt men and women. It is "Citadels of Snobbery,” by
Mrs. Glenn Frank, widow of a college president and former mem-
ber of Pi Beta Phi sorority (not represented here.) The article

speaks of the harm done by sorori-
ties and fraternities. Departing
from convention we would like to
presenta short review of the article.

Mrs. Frank first points out that
the general public believes that the
whole problem is a "tempest in a
teapot.” She says that “adult tax-
payers who have neither closed
minds because they ‘belong’ nor
bitter resentment because they have
been snubbed believe:

Human nature being what it is,
there will always be exclusive
cliques in colleges as there are in
adult life. Nothing can be done about
it.

Any girl or boy who is so weak
as to quit school ornourish a broken
heart merely because of a snub is
not worth worrying about.

A uthor Admits Truth

Fraternities and sororities are
not nearly so important as they
were before the advent of the ex-
GI’s hit the nation's campuses.
They even do some good, relieving
the housing shortage for instance
and contributing to charities.

The author admits there is some
truth in each of these statements.
She finds, however, that the damage
done by these Greek-letter societies
in a time when we are trying so to
promote Americanism vigorously is
a poor compensation for what little
good they accomplish.

Mrs. Frank takes the defense of
many frat men here that it is natural
for human beings to seek out and
make friends of some to the exclu-
sion of others, and completely dis-
proves it.

She claims that sororities and fra-
ternities actually “interfere with
this process.” In proving her point
she asks "What intelligent person
can believe that rushing shenani-
gans are a valid basis forming
friendships?” She also lists sev-
eral actual cases illustrating this

.point.

Charity on Campus

Ac cording to Mrs. Frank the
sorority and fraternity people them-
selves pay’"5in acquiring a calcu-
lated snobbery or a false sense of
snobbery that will serve them ill in
real life.” i

"Charity for sororities begins
on campus. Sorority girls can’:
mend the broken hearts of rejected
girls who sit with them every day
in class by sending food to starv-
ing people in Europe.”

She answers the housing shortage
point by saying:

“If colleges and universities
must condonea cruel, undemocratic
system because of property, then I
see very little hope for ultimately
preserving the American way of
life.”

"Citadels of Snobbery" is an
article which every frat man or
womanwhois so taken by the glamor
of the Greek-letter system that they
can see no wrong init should read.
The evil is too evident to be taken
lightly any longer.There are Ameri-
can universities, some of them our
mosthighly-respected schools, who
have tossed out an undemocratic
and foulrsystem. Why can’t we?

The News, of course, has to
choose the most newsworthy sub-
jects, and it is impossible toreport
every incident which occurs in Con-
gress. Therefore, it would seem

that Congress itself must seek some /

additional means of presenting it-
self to the students.

Meetings Open

It has been stated that any and
all students are invited to sit in
on Congress meetings, which are
held every Monday at 3:30 in room
832. The number of students who
can fit into that room comfortably,
however, happens to be limited to
the number of Congress members
plus the advisers. Any additional
occupants makes the cubbyhole
look like Noah's Ark in mating sea-
son.

But, in the way of giving the stu-
dents some sortof first-hand look-in
on their representatives at work,
here is a suggestion that Congress
might try on for size:

Staged Session

Schedule one of the meetings, say
shortly after the new semester be-
gins, for the auditorium or the so-
cial room of Foster Memorial Hall
in the form ofa Congress-sponsored
assembly.

Keep it, if possible, as much un-
rehearsed as you can . That means
that committee chairman will not
hand in or prepare written reports
ahead of time, the more outspoken
members will not prepare their
their speeches or statements be-
forehand, and no special topics or
legislation will be planned. That
way the meeting willibe as much as
possible like any regular meeting,
although the members may be some-
what reticent or at least stage-
struck by their unusual position.

Not a Panacea

Think it over, Congress; it's not
a panacea for all your publicity
problems, but it ought to help. And,
if it does come off, the students
owe it to themselves and to their
representatives to attend the spe-
cial session.

And it might not be a bad idea if
interested students started showing
up at the next few regular meetings.
It could inspire Congress to take
action on the suggestion, and, if it
gets warm enough, it might shorten
the meetings a little.

Advice Returned

Honorable Congressmen:

Since I first began covering Stu-
dent Congress on Oct. 3, many of
you have advised me how to write
my stories. You have instructed me
what news to admit or delete and
the stories you didn’t wish printed.

—I wish to express my gratitude
for your unsolicited concern over
my welfare. As a little boy, a long
time ago, I learned one may lose
friends if g1ft§ and compliments

are not returned promptly. There-

fore I wish to repay your considera-
tion, if I may, by giving you in
return a bit of unasked-for advice.

You must do something to improve
your record unless you wish to be
known as ado-nothing Congress.
To date your work has been only of
the clerical nature and not, as your
name implies, legislative.

Gavel New Target

I realize that you are lost in a
maze of politics and personalities
caused by two eratic liberalleaders,
Howard Greenberger and Don Ewart,
at one extreme and the highly con-
servative leadership of your presi-
dent Flora Diemert at the other. I
also know that the behind-the-scene
maneuvering of your president and
the disrespect of the opposition for
the chair causes you a great deal
of annoyance. This disrespect will
now doubtless be directed to the
president's new $4.50 rosewood
gavel.

But you must rise above this
bickering and strive, despite these
interruptions, to perform yourduties,
as elected leaders of our large stu-
dent body.

Allow me to review your accom-
plishments thus far. You made an
auspicious debut with your Penn-
Special train. However this venture
failed, despite the terrific coverage
accorded it by the News. This,
perhaps, may serve to show you
that the "lack of publicity” is not
the reason for your series of fail-

ures.

The rallies and victory celebra-
tions followed. Some of you claimed
they were successes while others
said,theywere flops. This question
probably will never be settled. By
the way, what ever became of the
poll committee which was to report
on the students’ ‘preference of an
additional day tacked to the spring
semester and the time given to stu-
dents for social functions?

A Lot of Nothing

These two programs were follow-
ed by a mass of investigations,
look-i.n-to’s and criticisms. The
objects were the cafeteria, tuck
shops, book store, typewriters,
eighth floor recreation space, State
Halli, Ellsworth Center and Phar-
macy School. Nothing ever came of
any of this business.

You did set the dates for the
dances and,by your own admission,
the majority were social and finan-
cial disgraces.

Which brings us up to date and
the controversial Faculty—Rating
program. This program, bequeathed
you by last year's Congress, has
had you in a dither from the very
first, hasn’t it?

I suspected as much when you
refused to outline a definite plan of
action and kept delaying it. But,
ladies and gentlemen, that was a
very unsportmanlike motion which
forced me to leave your presence
during the "locked-door" session
while you go out from under the
program and passed on the respon-
sibility to others.

' You Betrayed Us

This act caused me to lose a
great deal of respect for you, whom
I've considered my leaders. Tell
me, how can we the governed be
expected to react when our elected
superiors desert us?

You haven't accomplished very
much in ‘fourteen weeks, on an

./

,/

average of two hours per meeting,
have you? Think of all the wasted
time which you could have put to
good use. But perhaps you would
rather continue your aimless dis-
cussions.

I would like to see you set up a
definite program and adhere to it
for the remainder of the year. You
may start by spending a l‘ittle of
that $1900 budget allotted you.
After all, the school year is half
over and you have spent only $300.
While ec'onomy is an admirable
trait, you seem to be acting a bit
right-fisted for a progress legis-
lature.

Youaappear more interested in
the accouterments of your office
than you are of the welfare of the
students whom you were elected to
serve. Forget the gavel, keys, and
letterheads and concentrate on the
constitutional amendment, Com-
mons Room and St udent Center.

In conclusion let me suggest, if
you’ll excuse my impertinence, that
if you intend to reorganize yourself
internally, now is the time to start.
But if you continue as you were
then you should move yourself into
room 801 to do your clerical duties.
They have typewriters there.

He also said Kovar should not
have made his statement to the
News revealing the closed subject
of the meeting. He called it "un-

Kovar, who is also the managing

my first duty was with the News.
I took notes openly and did not

Blase About

Bulleyes

By DAVE WINTER

Bullseye!

That’s one cry you will often hear echoing from the Pitt rifle
range underneath the Stadium near Gate 1. Bullseyes are as com-
mon as red pencil marks on a freshman theme for the men on the

varsity and ROTC rifle teams.’

Sgt. Watts Shablowski and his
b0Y5 could probably match bulls-
eyes with Sergeant York and Tenn-
essee Jed in the morning and still
have enou§1 good shots left in
their systems to take on Annie
Oakley, a dead-eye with a six-gun,
in the afternoon.

In the first of a series of three
intra-squad matches recently, Don
Furman knocked off a perfect 100
score, ten straight bullseyes, in
the prone position. Then he fin-
ished the kneeling and standing
stages, posting a final score of
282 out of a possible 300 points.

The National Rifle Association
rates a 275 score as “Expert.”

Bob Davis, 279, and John Dibler,
276, finished right behind Furman.
Fred lloffmaster notched a perfect
prone score but slipped to a 267
total after the kneeling and stand-
ing stages. _

lligh score for the three matches
will get the winner an NRA club
member's medal.

Coach Shablowski is a pretty
wicked shot himself. He can out-
shoot all of his boys. He excels
in the difficult standing position,
frequently banging out 90’s.

As an old high school "bolts
open” man myself, I can describe
the standing position for the reader
-- it’s frustrating.

You hold a rifle, which weighs
about ten pounds, at a 90-degree
angle from your body. That makes
the pull on your arm and shoulder
muscles about 30 pounds.

You wave the thing in the general
direction of a target with 10 two
inch circles on it, then hold your
breath. Try to concentrate on a
quarter-inch hunk of black card-
board in the center of a circle,
50 feet away. Squeeze off a shot,
open your eyes, and hope it wasn't
"out in the snow.”

plaque as city league titlist, com-
piling a perfect record in matches
with Tech and Duquesne.

This year the league has been
expanded to include Washington
and Jefferson and California State
Teachers College.

Shablowski says his three ROTC
squads bettered their 1949 scores
this year in the matches sponsored
annually by the Hearst newspapers.
Final standings have not yet been
released.

At present both the varsity and
cadet teams are competing in postal
matches with schools across the
nation. The ROTC teams are also
firing in Second Army matches.

Three away trips have been
tentatively scheduled for the var-
sity. They will travel to Maryland
University, West Virginia Univer-
sity and the NRA sectional champ-
ionships.

.. new field of research, "atomic

mt dicine,” has been indoctrinated
in the‘, University of Pittsburgh’s
S. hool -of Medicine.
- Radioactive isotopes, rriade avail-
able by the Pitt cyclotron, are being
vsed here in the study of conges-
tive heart failure, which produces
shortness of breath and dropsy.

Dr. Campbell Moses and Dr.
Frederick Franke are conducting
experiments for the study with
radioactive sodium, in the Medical

' School’s Addison H. Gibson Labora-

tory. Dr.'Moses, director of the Ad-
dison laboratory, and Dr. A.J. Allen,
head of the Pitt cyclotron, are co--
operating closely in this project.
“Because of the rapid deteriora-
tion of radioactive sodium,” Dr.
.Moses said in an interview, "the
proximity of the Pitt cyclotron is
of vital importance in these exper-
iments.”
, Radioactive particles injected
into the blood stream of experimen-
tal animals are followed through the
‘circulatory system with a Geiger
counter, an instrument which mea-
sures radioactivity. By using these
"tagged atoms” as tracers, the
doctor explained, it is possible to
study closely the heart and circu-
latory apparatus, even to the mea-
surement of the blood flow inside
the chambers of the heart.

"The big aim here is to find out
why salt accumulates in the tissues
to produce dropsy, and how these
accumulations can be prevented,”
Dr. Moses said.

In other experiments, radioactive
iodine is being used to study the

- functioning of the thyroid gland.

WSGA Vote
Talks Set

Tomorrow evening the final de-
cision of when nominees’ names
should be announced for women's
elections will be made by WSGA
Commission at their monthly meet-
ing in the Braun Room at 6:30 p.m.

The question of announcing the
names has been,under discussion
in both WSGA executive committee
and Commission for several weeks.
Tomorrow's meeting will climax the
discussion and avote will be taken
on the question.

Beside the important vote which
will be taken, the meeting also
marks an important step in Com-
mission meetings. For the first time
this year the meeting will be held
in the evening, preceded by a
dessert lunch.

_._

Fhe discussion of announcing
women’s nominees arose when some
members of the executive committee
questioned whether one day was
enough time to create intelligent
voting on the part of the women.

Representatives from all women’s
organizations will attend the meet-
ing to decide whether nominees’

‘names should continue to be an-

nounced one day before elections
or further in advance.

Since the Easter holidays pre-
cede this .year’s election, the de-
cision of Comission may not be
able to be strictly adhered to
this year. However, this decision
will be carried back to the execu-
tive committee and some provision
for next year’s system decided upon.

THE COMMONS ROOM is one
hundred feet wide and two hundred
feet long.

EX-City High Cage Star
Leaves Pitt for South

Jim liingham, ex-South Hills High
basketball star and Pitt student,
has applied for transfer to liastern
Kentucky State College.

The 6-5 center, who set a City
high school record by scoring 32
points in one game, was unhappy
at Pitt. llis grades were poor and
and his classroom attendance was
reportedly inconsistent.

Freshman Coach Bobby Aftma“
said that "Bingham attended only
three practice sessions.”

Parents Favored Pitt

Although the angular youth could
not be reached for comment, his
mother told the News that he was
not getting along well at the Uni-
versity.

"lie never wanted to go to Pitt
in the first place,” she said. "He
wanted to go out of town for his
college education, but his father
and I insisted he go to Pitt or no-
where. Mr. Bingham is acquainted
with Dr. Carslon (Pitt varsity
coach).

"Frankly, I have told Jim that
I think he is letting me down, and
if he put his mind down to it he

could succeed at Pitt.”

Troubled by Infections

Mrs. Bingham said that her son
had been troubled with carbuncles
on his legs and consequeiitly had
to miss practice. In addition, she‘
said he had sprained an ankle,

She denied that young Bingh-am’s
32-point performance had gone to
his head, as many say. “Why, I
was more exictcd over that game
than he was. He wasn’t at all im-
pressed by his own scoring.”

Eiingham had been negotiating
with North Carolina State in Dec-
ember, but just after New Year's
Day he spent several days on the
Eastern Kentucky campus and de-
cided to transfer to the Richmond
school.

the back of my neck.

Rushed to Hospital

"Luckily, I sort of sensed my
timing was bad, so I threw my hands
back in time to somewhat soften
the blow.”

Al wasimmediately rushed to the
hospital where X-rays proved noth-
ing was wrong. Ile couldhave easily
severed his spine from the fall.

"In diving,” says the Pitt junior,
‘everything must be perfect, or
near-perfect. A lowered shoulder,
a bad approach, or bad timing will
affect the judging."

Diving Shoe Salesman

Since judges also award points
for degree of difficulty as well as
posture, approach, and height,
Ciocca gambles with the tougher
dives. llis toughest dive is a half
gainer-half twist-forward one and
a half. It’s a type of running back
dive.

Ciocca feels his diving ability
helps him at his shoe-selling job.
After all, in diving you have to sell
the judges, and if you can sell
swimming judges, then it isn’t hard
to convince a woman that she's
wearing the wrong size.

Sports Editor

Winter isthe season when everyone up north wants to go south
to get away from it all -- particularly the people who put sports

pages together. “The doldrums,”

they call winter -- the time when

the sports world lays down to a quiet nap.

It is the time of year when you
are directed to columns of type
"officially” confirming the fact
that Joe Plumblum, who led the
National League batters by 83
percentage points, is the year’s
batting champ. Straight out of Com-
missioner Chandler’s office em-
erges the scoop.

As the first of the year nears,the
writers start telling you what hap-
pened during the year, what did
not happen, what will happen next
year, and what will not happen
next year. They pick the player

]of the year, the coach of the year,
the bum of the year.

Enlightenment

From Hank Greenberg comes word
V that his Indians will steal the
pennant from the Yanks. From
Casey Stengel comes the declara-
tion that his Yanks are in like
Flynn. From Zach Taylor comes the
revelation that, with more pitch-
ing, he hopes to have his St. Louis
Brown finish seventh.

In short, the sports pages are
ideal for wrapping up one’s lunch.

Fortunately, we are able to state
that sports is by no means in the
..doldrums at Pitt. On the .contrary,
these. are bustling days on the
University campus.

Thanks to Athletic Director Tom
Hamilton and Graduate Manager
Frank Carver, there is more act-
ivity on the winter athletic front
than in many a past season.

Wrestling and freshman basket-

 

The

ball have been reincarnated.
swimmers are gradually develop-

ing into an eastern power. The
tracksters make an occasional
jaunt. And while the basketball

club is undergoing a depression
in the win column, how can their
plight ever grow dull with Doc
Carlson_ around?

True enough, none of these sports
can, by themselves, match the in-
terest of a football game. But as
a group, they provide a pretty
snappy winter.

We ighty Here

To the outside world, naturally,
our wrestlers and swimmers may_
be less interesting than the can-
asta championships of West Colo-
rado But their importance magni-
fies many times on the campus.

No, we won’t have to feed you

the "official” batting averages
from last baseball season, for
things‘ are rather lively around
here. Why, Paul Dietz, a mere
junior, has even won the National
Intercollegiate Chess Champion-
ship.

LEMME UP - Pitt’s Frank Skirpan (white knee
guards) is shown trying to escape from Lock Haven’s
Frank Vulcano in the first period of the 145-pound
mat 'fra'y at the Stadium Saturday. Here, Vulcano, who

went on to win a 10-5 decision over Pitt's entrant, is
credited with a near fall. Vulcano and his teammates
erupted to the tune of three falls and three decisions
to defeat the Panthers, 24-6.

Wrecks Edge

Boys Town

Taking an early first half lead
which they never relinquished, the
Rambling Wrecks s“ eezed by the
Boys Towners, 3,1-2 , at the Logan
Armory Wednesday night.

Russ Schewitz was the offensive
ace for the Rambling Wrecks with
14 points. At the end of the first
half the Boys Towners, comprised
of Pitt varsity trackmen, found
themselves trailing 19-13. Their
iron lungs could not ‘cope with the
superior height of the Wrecks.

The Boys Towners threathened
in the second half, but the final
gun found them two points short.
Roy Lee was the high man for the
losers with nine points.

Alpha Phi Wins
Alpha Phi Alpha brought their
record to a .500 percentage Friday
night by downing a taller Pi Lam
quint, 38-32.
Bobby Lee sparked the victors

with 19 points, sinking most of them

from almost half court. Lee's first
set shot put his team in front to
stay, 2-0, even though their oppon-
ents were aconstant threat through-
out the game. In close competition
to Lee’s 19 points were the 15
popped through. by Fred Klein for
the losers.

The losers trailed by three points
at the ‘half with the score reading,
18-15. They stayed close to victors
until the final minutes of play, but
a push shot from the side and a
foul shot by Rus Phillips ended all
hopes for the Pi Lams.

Pitt’s wrestlers, who lost to Lock

Sports Columnist Dewey llelmick
of West Virginia University’s "Daily
Athenaeum” last week deplored the
fact that Billy Reynolds, an ex-
West Virginia high school grid star,
is matriculating at Pitt.

What is more, Helmick declared
"the people ofSt.Mary’s (Reyralds’
home town) are hopping mad over
the Reynolds incident, and it will
take more than a banquet speech to
change their present attitude to-
ward the University (West Virgin-
ial.” ,

Not Interested

According to Helmick, the young
halfback told him recently that
West Virginia did not become in-
terested in him until a number of
,other gchools had approached him
with very attractive offers.

Reynolds wanted to attend the
Mountaineer school with his friends,

Migrations to Pennsylvania

"Evidently West Virginia of late
has been slow in approaching Moun-
tain State athletes...The northern
part of the state has always been a
good source for Mountaineer foot-
ball material, and it would certainly
be a shame if northern athletes
were to -migrate to Pennsylvania and
Ohio schools in the same propor-
tion that southern West Virginia
gridders go south of the border for

an education, the columnist con-

cluded.

Reynolds is currently a freshman
here. During his season of frosh
competition, he showed more pro-
mise on defense than offensively.
However, he was a triple-threat
flash in high school, and coaches
attribute his slowing down to the

claimed Helmick. "Certain St. fact that he is now playing under

Mary's citizens feel Reynolds was a different variation of the si gle

snubbed by University athletic wing and must form new habits.

First Place
Soccer Tilt

Just who owns first place in the
intramural six-man soccer league
will be decided today at Ellsworth
Center when the All-Stars (1-0) meet
the Yankees (2-03. Four o’clock is
the hour of decision.

This game promises to be the
first highlight of this new intra-
mural sport which had it's inception
here this season. The appearance
of soccer in Pitt intramurals is an-
other feather in the cap Of Intra-
mural Director Leo Bemis who has
boosted almost every sport known
since his arrival at the University
in 1947.

The present league consists of
four teams. They include, in addi-
tion to the first place clubs, the
First Presbyterian Church and Ells-

worth Center.
Bill Durkit of the Yanks and Carl

i Masterandrea of Ellsworth were,

according to Bemis, instrumental
in the formation of the league.
Today's contest will be followed
Thursday by a game between the
All-Stars and Ellsworth. Starting

. time again will be 4 p.m.

Last _week’s action saw the All-
Stars edging the Presbyterian Church
boys, 3-2.

Present standings:

Yankees (2-03, All-Stars (1-Ola

ii First Presbyterian Church (1-2),

':  llsworth Center (0-2).

There is no doorway nor is there
a walk across the lawn. There is
just an isolated pair of steps lead-
ing nowhere.

Approach with Caution

There are also doors-in the Com-
mons Room one must_ approach with
caution. No one seems to have seen
two doors, supposedly leading to
Dean Rush’s office, ever opened.

Not only are there doors that
go nowhere, there are windows that
are equally deceiving. To climb
out the window of the Syria Lebanon

“A Door Will 0pen‘,’i’ ‘
You May Find Nothing

By LEO MOSS
Never, never rush through a door at ‘Pitt with full confidence
that you will find anything at the other side.

For instance, on the Fifth Ave. side of the Cathedral there
in an exquisite pair of steps leading up to what should be a door-

Behind these, permanent elevators

Unused Stone Benches
The architects of the Cathedral

very considerately placed stone
benches in the ventilation courts
around the Commons Room. One
need only to climb through a win-

The cafeteria offers another
oddity. The center of the room is
high but around the edges the ceil-
ing drops about 15 feet. Apparently
all that space is not used for any-
thing.

At the Bigelow entrance to the
Cathedral is a fountain that, for
the last few years, has never been
known to spout. ,

Rolled stockings, shingle hair-
cuts, and the tango were a winning
combination Thursday as Junior
class coeds won the coveted Inter-
class Sing cup.

With a skit depicting the "Flapper
Age,” the class of 1951 took the
decision from the other women's
classes competing on the theme of
“Pitt Through the Ages.” Flappers,
"sheiks,” and vamps sang and
danced in a classroom typical of
1923.

The "Charleston,’ tango, and
other dances reminiscent ofthe age
of prohibition were much in evi-
dence, to the delight of both judges
and audience.

Competing with the flappers were
senior _ "pioneers,” sophomore

'Egyptians,” and freshmen of the

“Homeric Age.” _

Prior to the presentation of the
sing skits, the judges took part in
one of their own. Letting their hair
down were Dean llelen P. Rush,
Dr. Auleene Jamison, Miss Eleanor
Graham, William H. Bliss, and Dr.
John Geise. '

Announcement of the winners
and presentation of the cup to

man, was made by Dr. Geise.
