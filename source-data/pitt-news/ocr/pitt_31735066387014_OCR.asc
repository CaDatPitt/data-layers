system needs
active role of

participation,

says UPBC

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Led by chair Mark Nordenberg, the
University Planning and Budgeting Committee
presented their plans and reviewed the
progress of their new attribution system at a
meeting of the University Senate yesterday.

“One of the principle features of this new
system is its call for active participation by fac-
ulty, staff and students as well as administrators
at. every level of the planning and budgeting
system,” said Nordenberg, who is Pitt’s interim
provost and a former dean of the Pitt Law
School. 4 ' '

According to a draft distributed by the com-
mittee, the attribution methodology will lead to
improved record-keeping, quantitative assess-
ment, decision-making and motivation in the
budget process. According tothe committee,
attribution will be linked to credit hours within
schools of the university.

Questions about the plan were raised by sev-
eral senate members, including Dr. Robert
Mundell of the Pitt Dental School. Mundell
asked if the attribution method would affect
the fact that the hours taught by dental school
faculty have increased in the past 10 years
without increased allocation. .

“Responsibility and~ visibility will b
enhanced,” Senate Budget Policies Committee
chair Philip Wion said. “The people making the
decisions will be expected to account for their
decisions.”

Nordenberg said the committee is working to
progress forward with the budget planning.

“As we entered this year, we knew there
were two major tasks we would confront. One
was short-term budget, and the other was long-
range planning,” Nordenberg said.

He said necessary reductions in the short-

BAS chair election to be held Friday

Byjohn B. Moore
Staff Writer

On Friday, members of the Black
Action Society will cast votes for the
office of chairperson.

Vying for this position are Rinaldo
Washington and Michael Barge, both
currently holding positions with BAS.

Barge, serving as deputy chair for the
BAS, said if elected he would like to
continue with the current structure of

the organization and advance even fur- A

ther. ,
“What I would like to do as chairper-
son of BAS,” Barge said, “is to expand
the BAS and get more participation
among African students.” ‘ 9

The BAS has been proliﬁc in the past’

year with the number of lectures it has
sponsored on campus. I
Barge said he would like to have as
many lectures next year, but the
responsibility of finding speakers

would not only be up to him.

“As one person, I would not be
elected dictator. It is not just up to me
todecide the lectures, that wouldbe
up to the steering committee.”

Elections for chairperson will be held
between 10 21.111 and 6 p.rn. in the
lobbies of the Towers and Lothrop
Hall. ‘ 9

Numerous attempts were made to
Contact Rinaldo Washington for com-
ment, but all were unsuccessful.

Politician tells new
group to keep beliefs

By Bryan Bender
Staﬂ Writer

Although more people are
practicing “safe sex” than in the
past, there are still countless
numbers which are not. The
spread of sexually transmitted
diseases is rising at an alarming
rate.

Educators from the AIDS Task
Force led a discussion in the
William Pitt Union last night
highlighting the dangers of
unprotected sex and gave tips
on how everyone, regardless of
sexual orientation, can protect
themselves and those around
them.

The discussion, sponsored by
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian

Alliance, began with some star-
tling statistics.

According to the Task Force,
in 1989, among the age group
13-to-29 there were 259,450
reported cases of the HIV virus,
the virus which causes AIDS.
That number leaped 264 per-
cent to 631,530 in 1993.

But not only are HIV cases
increasing, so are the many
other different kinds of sexually
transmitted diseases.

These increases have been
found most repeatedly in those
from ages 13-to-19, according to
Task—Force statistics. More and
more are becoming sexually
active at a younger age than
previously thought and many of
them are not practicing safe sex,

in part due to the fact that at
such a young age the repercus-
sions of diseases like AIDS are
not witnessed firsthand among
peers.

The presenters ‘stressed that
although many people still think
the AIDS epidemic is agay,
white-male one, there has been
a greater increase in reported
cases among the heterosexual
community in the past few years
than in the gay one.

And those in the gay commu-
nity, according to the seminar,
are more aware and are practic-
ing safer sex than the heterosex-
ual community.

Many times, according to
Task-Force member Christine

Republican State
Committee candidate and
Pitt graduate Jacinta Marie
Dvorak told the newly-
formed Organization of
Minority and Female
Conservatives last night to
stick to their beliefs.

Dvorak, speakingat the
second meeting of OMFC,
said it is not easy to be con-
servative on a college carn-
pus.

“There are a lot of people
out there who hold liberal
ideas which I believe are
wrong," said Dvorak. who is

a former president of Pitts
College Republicans. “They
want the government to take
care of too much. We need
to bring back the ethic of
hard work."

She also talked about her
own experiences at Pitt, from
which she graduated in 1992.

“My senior year I was a
very outspoken pro-consery-
ative, pro-Republican
activist," Dvorak said. “I
found out that many groups
on campus say they want
free speech, but when there
is an opposing voice, they
want it silenced.”

Eat your vegetables. Use

Most male students get

Continued from page 1
President Booker Stallworth,

the organization was
established this semester in

light of other Pitt groups"

claims about who they repre-
sent.

“The [Black Action Society]
and [Campus Women’s
Organization} say they repre-
sent all minorities and women
on campus,” Stallworth
said. He said certain state-

ments by both organizations A

have led him to believe
that they are not accurately
representing these groups
overall.

Co-President Megan
Cortazzo said OMFC’s discus-
sion about women will
go beyond the issue of abor-
tion.

“We hope to discuss
women’s issues such as equal
pay, education and opportu-
nities in the workplace,” she
said.

Cortazzo said she was par-
ticularly concerned about the
possibility of a Women’s
Studies major at Pitt.

“We want to make sure
classes aren’t taught from
strictly a liberal view,” she

. said.

“Both sides should be clear
to students.”

Dvorak said she was glad to
see students interested in get-
ting back to grassroots con-
servatism and planned to
bring such a voice to the state
committee.

“The committee is responsi-
ble for setting the platfomi of
the Republican Party in
Pennsylvania which includes
the endorsement of candi-
dates,” Dvorak said, “But I
think they’ve forgotten about
grassroots activities.”

‘ She said she ﬁrmly believes
in Abraham Lincoln’s‘ words
about not furthering “the
brotherhood of man

by encouraging class hatred”
and not helping, the poor
by destroying the rich. She
asked OMFC to encourage
others to see the value of con-
servatism.

Stallworth said he has got‘-
ten positive feedback about
OMFC.

“We have more members
than the
Democrats]
Stallworth said.

He said he wanted people

already,”

a to know about OMFC as

an alternative to the other
groups with a “stereotypical
edge?

OMFC’s upcoming events
include a speech by Joe
Watkins, an African-American
candidate for the United

"States Senate, set for April

5.

Fortieth District state
Senator Melissa Hart will be
speaking to the group on
April 14.

The Task-Force members also

According to Task-Force

a myth among many that
safe-sex devices like condoms
are purely forms of birth con-

to prevent unexpected babies

Director of the Program in International Affairs at
the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School
of Public and International Atlairs. His most
recent We All Lost the Cold War co-authored
with Janice Gross Stein of the University ol

Lebow and Stein contend, contrary to the

provoked crises instead of preventing them, and
preserved the Cold War rather than ending it.

term budget were operated to the bene-
fit of academic areas.

“For example, the reduction assigned
to the provost was 1.2 percent while the
reduction assigned to business and
finance was 2.1 percent,” Nordenberg
said. , ,

He said the committee is viewing 1995
projections with “a great deal of cau-
tion,” because further cuts may be neces-

sary.
“The news from Harrisburg has sug-

gested that our present projections are
indeed optimistic, and adjustments will
now be required,” Nordenberg said.
“lBut] we are committed to making what-
ever necessary adjustments from those
accounts that we had intended to
increase during the next fiscal year,
rather than going back to the units and
imposing additional budget reductions
on them.” _

He said the attribution methodology
would be used by the UPBC for long-
range planning due to its ability to trace

revenues and expenditures.
“We’ve done our best to structure an

-appropriate process for long-range plan-

ning in the university,” Nordenberg said.
“We are beginning to consider the
broader strategic issues which must be
addressed if the university is to have a
healthy future.”

He said UPBC is also looking into how
Pitt should position itself to respond to
alliances with other institutions as well
as improving its own internal partner-
ships.

One senate member, jean Blachere, a
professor in the School of Engineering,
suggested that the UPBC better commu-
nicate its purpose to faculty members.

“Many regard the UPBC as a commit-
tee which just makes cuts,” Blachere
said.

The committee emphasized that its
conclusions were only advisory reports
to the senior administration, who make
the final decisions on the university bud-
get.

meats and salty snack foods
(chips or pretzels) are probably
getting too much salt. _

Fat intake among students is
usually high. High-fat foods stu-
dents eat include french fries,
fried chicken, hoagies with
mayonnaise, ice cream and

doughnuts.

The most frequent source of
sugar in a students’ diet comes
from candy bars (which are
about 50 percent fat) and soft
drinks.

So how can a student improve
their diet? A good way to start is
to keep a food record for one
week and seehow your eating
compares to the Food Guide

Pyramid. If you eat according to
the Pyramid, you will be getting
a variety of foods in moderation
and a balanced diet.

Disparity transcends media

Last Monday, an athlete on the Women’s track team
was misidentified in a photograph in The Pitt News
sports section. Although this mistake is regrettable, it
must be remembered that nothing is perfect 100 per-
cent of the time. The Lady Panthers track team does
not feel they get proper respect, and this oversight
brought the issue to a head.
Track team member Allison Williams expressed this

view by saying, “I think the respect they [The Pitt Newsl

give to Women’s sports compared to men’s sports is
ridiculous. The difference is unnecessary and laziness.”

In addition, she said that the student paper spends
too much time covering professional sports while

. neglecting non—revenue sports within the university. At

the same time, she suggested that The Pitt News should
not cover college sports if Pitt is not involved. For
example, she intimated that since Pitt is not in the Final
Four, the sports section should not cover that event.
The Pitt News is designed to provide college students
with information that they want and need. Part of this
body of information includes professional and college

sports from around the country. Simply because Pitt is A

not in the Final Four does not mean that Pitt students

have no interest in the Final Four basketball tourna-

ment. S ’
Despite the fact that colleges are sometimes accused

-ofbeing isolated in ivory towers, there is no reason the

student paper should promote student apathy of off-
campus events in sports or in any other department.

The Pitt News will continue to cover professional
sports and other collegiate sports, because this is what
the readership demands. The primary job of a newspa.—
per is to provide timely and useful information to its
readers. ‘ I

For the past four- years, there has been a consistent
attempt by the sports section to maintain a balance in
coverage,,:for-:~men’s and women’s sports. ’

There is no argument about whether there is dispari-
ty within the realm of athletics. However, these
inequalities are a result of much more than the media
and which sporting events newspapers choose to

If only the media were at.fault,‘then such problems

as a lack of resfpect wo.uld..be ,easilydefin_ed and

solved.

Questions concerninggender equality in athletics and
disparity in sports ‘funding are currently being dis-
cussed by athletic departments all over the nation.
Departments are struggling to formulate policies to
ensure women and men are treated equally in colle-
giate athletics.

Although the media may play a role in how sporting
events are reported to the public and how much
emphasis is placed on them, the issue of disparity runs
much deeper thanthe pages of college newspapers.

It isn’t often that mainstream
cinema is recognized as capa-

ble of producing a strong, and

at the same time enduring,
impression on audiences. Once
the lights go up and the last
credit has rolled, or when the
last slice of pizza is eaten at
post-movie dinner discussions,
the film’s potency is probably
diminished
Granted, catchphrases can
stand the test of time, although
“Schwing!” appears to have
basically disappeared from
popular vocabu'lary,,.and espe-
cially powerful images have
the ability to endure for years,
like thatdamn shark in jaws.
Still, once a movie is gone
from the theaters, it’s also gone
from our immediate individual
and collective consciousness.
Lately, however, it seemsthat
independent cinema has been

able, to, transcend this cultural 
‘phenomenon and supply us‘

with some interesting messages

and images in its movies.
Examples which spring to

mind are the odd love that

I evolved in The Crying Game,
the brutality of Reservoir Dogs

and the redemption in Bad
Lieutenant. (Yeah, it was there;
you just have to hunt for it a
bit.)

So, it was with this sensibility
that mainstream movies are
devoid of strong impressionis-
tic abilities that Igwent to see
Philadelphia. I wasn’t sure
what to expect from the first
mainstream movie to deal with
AIDS. And I was definitely not
prepared to deal with the
intense and automatic reaction
I ’ had while watching
Philadelphia, alone, during a
Saturday matinee, several
weeks ago. (I mean, I had no
Kleenex with me, and I began
steadily sobbing about 80 min-
utes into the movie.) As I
watched Tom Hanks slowly
deteriorate, emotionally and
physically, I realized that this
film wasn’t so much about
AIDS, homosexuality, homo-
phobia or discrimination, as
much of the hoopla surround-

somewhat. ‘

ing it would have made you
believe. Instead, this movie
was about humanity.

Since my purpose here isn’t
to digress into a quasi-review
of this film, I’ll dispense with
the details of the fabulous
opening credit sequence and
the equally beautiful but chill-
ing song by Bruce Springsteen,
which netted him an Oscar for
Best Original Song, so I can
concentrate on the human
quality that will hopefully
become. the hallmark of

    Amy E
Hajduk

Philadelphia.

I remember feeling dazed
and somber as I left the the-
ater, which was ironic since the
film delivered such a life-
affirming message. Sure, it
was depressing and sad, but
if you have an ounce of sensi-
tivity in you (you do, don’t
you?), I think you’ll be able to
find the intense human spirit
thatis emanating from this
movie. I

I’ve heard that a number of
gay and AIDS activists didn’t
like Philadelphia because it
didn’t do enough or go far
enough. (Tom Hanks and
Antonio Banderas have no
overtly affectionate and physi-
cal scenes.) Well, according to
director Jonathan Demme,
Philadelphia was never meant
to function as a readily accessi-
ble vehicle to promote AIDS
awareness and acceptance.
Even Denzel Washington, who
starred opposite Hanks as the
homophobic lawyer who even-
tually took on Hanks’ case,
said in Premiere that we should
be cautious about the ability of
Philadelphia to cause a radical
change in public perception.
“People don’t change much.
One of the smart things about
the movie is that my character
changes maybe eight degrees
 So, yeah, I hope
Philadelphia makes a differ-

"Philadelphia's" hallmark is humanity .

ence, but let’s not go over-

board either. You pay your $7
and eat your popcorn. It’s only
a movie. It ain’t gonna change
the world.” While we may not
like this sentiment, it is defi-
nitely true, and it is most cer-
tainlyrhuman.

The most interesting thing
about the AIDS aspect, inciden-
tally, was that Andrew
Beckett’s family already accept-
ed him. The struggle ofjustify—
ing Beckett’s character as a gay
man w.ith‘*A'-IDS was never an
issue. He started the movie as
a gay man whose family loved
him. That was a refreshing atti-
tude, and pretty surprising for
mainstream Cinema, if you
think about it. . I

Maybe some people hoped

‘Philadelphia would become.

an incendiary ‘polemic in
the fight against V. AIDS
and homophobia. It doesn’t
appear that this has happened,
although Tom Hanks did win
a Best Actor Oscar for his
role, which, coming from
the tradition-loving and contro-
versy—avoiding
of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences, might signal
that society, vis-a-vis
Hollywood, is finally ready to
embrace AIDS with at least a
degree of comfort. And maybe
the entertainment community
should strive to do more when
it comes to current social ills.
However, regarding
Philadelphia, I think Demme
has ma_naged to create a pow-
erful portrait of human grace,
spirit and dignity. It just so
happens that some of the char-
acters who demonstrate these
qualities are gay and have
AIDS.

If you haven’t seen
Philadelphia yet, or aren’t
convinced that the humanity of
the film triumphs over every
other aspect of the film, then
you ought to see it, or view it
again. But, do me a favor,
make sure you see it with
someone you love.

Double-header sweep over Dukes runs Pitt record to 9-4

Offensive explosion powers Pitt baseballto 6-3, 18-5 win over crostow val Duquesne yesterday at Trees Field.

By Sean Duncan -1
Staﬂ‘ Writer

A ﬁve-run sixth inning hoisted the Pitt
baseball team (9-4) over Duquesne
University'(3-6) 6-3 in the first game of
its home opener yesterday at Trees Field.
The Panthers ﬁnished the doubleheader
sweep by winning the second game, 18-
5.

Down 3-1 in the bottom of the sixth
inning, the Panthers finally figured out
Duquesne’s starting pitcher Tim Gribble
with a little help from the Dukes’
defense.

Shortstop Danny Gonzalez led off with
a single to third and scored on two errors
after Tyler Shantz grounded out.
Flustered by the errors, Gribble proceed-
ed to walk the next two batters —— then
he got yanked.'Josh Tyler then singled,
loading up the bases. -

Ken Strish picked up an easy RBI
when Duquesne reliever _Jamey Keysor
walked in the tying mn. Jason Conti con-
tinued the onslaught as he singled to
right field. The final blow was dealt by
Scott Etsell’s two-run single.

After it was all said and done in the
sixth, Pitt was ahead for good, 6-3.

“We were patient,” second baseman
Etsell said. “Their pitcher was throwing a
lot of junk, and we weren’t really hitting
him very good the first couple of
innings. jnce we relaxed and sat back
and waited for our pitch we started to hit

. the ball good.”

I “We stayed with it,” head coach Mark
an orxo-\ on}. _:“‘Tf’,n .~,\.n.\,~.o-;.-.-,\.. 5.-..-. 4... ,._,..
Jackson sai . ‘Its sometimes easy to get
frustrated theway the pitcher was throw-

ing. It.’s ai-‘little bit frustrating at times‘_

 

J g . . . . J O Y 10 H W
Jon Deﬁernardis (we promise) had a home runin yesterday's doubleheader

sweep for the Panthers ,

when someone is not throwing hard,
and youthink you should be hitting it,

e Pitt"

and you’re'not. We deserve credit for not
getting frustrated.” ~

While Pitt maintained its composure,
Duquesne couldn’t figure out the

Panthers’ pitchers. Tedde Campbell and ’

Gregg Mrochko coupled to stymie the
Dukes for three hits.

Starter Campbell pitched three innings
and gave up all three runs.

The other story of the game was
Mrochko’s stellar performance. He

_allowed one hit in four scoreless innings

and struck out three with no walks as he
improved his record to 3-0.

“I was focused,” Mrochko said. “I just
hit my spots and threw strikes, and that's
all I have to do.”

“His slider was working and his fast-
ball, he was throwing in,” Jackson said.
“He had good location, and when you
have good location, it’s tough to hit.”

In the second game the Panthers wast-
ed no time scoring — bombing the
Dukes for 18 runs. ‘

Demoralized by Pitt’s late heroics,
Duquesne was reminiscent of a Little
League team — committing seven errors.

“I think the first game could have been
a little bit discouraging for them
[Duquesne], because they were up
ahead and we came back,” Jackson said.

Pitt’s highlights came fast and furious
in the first three innings. - *

Craig Cawley walked to lead off the
game. Two batters later Etsell collected
his first of his three hits and three RBI.

The next two innings, Pitt hit the
Dukes with a blitzkrieg, scoring 11 runs.
Catcher Jon DeBernardis.capped the hit-

 fest with a two-run blast over the left-

center ﬁeld fence. , -
Starting pitcher Kevin Kramer (2-0)
threw three scoreless innings‘ for the win.

Women's track program speaks out on lotc/eo respect

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

Despite nine years of success, the Pitt
women’s track athletes feel they get the
Rodney Dangerfield treatment.

“We don’t get any respect,” first-year
performer Jennifer Williams said.

“People at the university don’t even
know that we have an active track pro-
gram,” sophomore Tonia Mullins added.
“'It’s like, we have one of the best records
on campus when it comes down to Big
East and national competition, but you

always hear about the football and bas-I

ketball team.”
_ But to the rest of the nation, the Pitt
women’s track and field program has
been one of the most successfulcolle-
giate programs.

Since 1985, the Lady Panthers have
had a tradition of having at least one All-

American on theteam. (This year,

sophomore Najuma Fletcher continued
that tradition by taking third in the triple
jump at the NCAA indoor national cham-
pionship.) For the record, the Lady
Panthers won the Big East Indoor
Championship in 1989, as well as win-
ning the outdoor conference title in 1990

- and 1991.

On January 29, Pitt’s shuttle hurdle
relay team went into competition with-
out three of its top hurdlers.

The foursome of Staci Suggs, Williams,
Mullins and Megan Ferrara shocked a
standing-room-only crowd as they
shaved .05 off the world record set by
Pitt 21 year ago. The new world record is
29.55 seconds.

Nevertheless, the Lady Panthers say
they get don’t get their fair share of pub-
licity

On Monday, there was an article writ-
ten in 7799 Pitt News about Mary Allison
Williams, the four—time Big East champi-
on in the 55-meter hurdles. V

According to the two-time All-
American and 1994 Big East Scholar-

Athlete of the Year, the article was a slap '

in the face. The article had a picture of
Najuma Fletcher when referring to
Williams. '

“They [The Pitt News] cover every bas-
ketball event in depth with pictures, and
those guys had a horrible season,” the
1993 Blue—Gold Award winner said. “I
am a first-year graduate student, and I
think I have been here long enough to
get my article and name on the same
page with the correct picture.

“Secondly, Najuma lFletcher, who was
named Outstanding Field Performer in
the women’s competition at the 1994 Big
East Indoor Championships] has enough
status and publicity that [T799 Pitt News]
should be able to pinpoint that that’s
Najuma Fletcher and that’s Allison
Williams. If [The Pitt News] wants to pin-
point two standouts, at least you sho_uld
be able to recognize my face in the pic-
ture.

“I think the respect they give women’s
sports compared to men’s sports is
ridiculous. The difference is unneces-
sary,and it’s laziness.”

Not everyone involved in women’s
athletics feels unappreciated. Cindy
Braziel, head volleyball coach at Pitt
said, “I will only speak for volleyball 

we have gotten tremendous support
from The Pitt News.

“I feel that I read as much about the
[women’s athletics] as we do about base-
ball or other sports we are competing
with for coverage.”

The coverage of volleyball is little con-
solation for other women athletes.

Williams discussed how 7799 Pitt News
worries too much about professional
sports but at the same time neglects non-
revenue sports within the university.

“A lot of times, I noticed in the sports
section they write a lot things that have
nothing to do with Pitt athletes,”
Williams said. “They write stuff on the
Super Bowl. They write stuff on the Final
Four. If Pitt is not in the Final Four, then
it doesn’t belong in The Pitt News.

“If the Steelers, Piratesand Penguins
are doing well, I understand a little pub-
licity; we are still in the city of Pittsburgh.
But there is no reason why they should
get more coverage than the women’s
track team or the tennis team, the golf
team or the damn basket weaving team
for that matter. If [779e Pitt News] wants to
report whatever is going on in the city,
then let them call it the Pittsburgh City
Newspaper.”

Williams’ complaint of lack of respect
extends to the University’s Athletic
Department.

“A lot of times people do not want to
talk about it because they feel that they
are going to get in trouble,” the
Bayshore, N.Y. native said, “but it per-
petuates all the way down from the head
of the athletic department down to the
managers that hand out our shoes at

practice.

“To the athletic department, the rev-
enue sports are of higher priority than
the non-revenue sports,” Williams said.

“Whenever it is convenient to put every-. 9

one on the same level, then the athletic
department puts everyone on the same
level. I don’t think it is a personal thing. I
don’t think they do it against any sort of
team on purpose, although I think it is
an attitude that perpetuates through the
entire department.”

An example of this is the 1994 track
and ﬁeld media guide. Half the book is
devoted to other aspects of the athletic
program and the university, ranging
from the chancellor to the Golden
Panthers. .

Officials at Pitt’s Sports Information
Department who made up the media
guide were unavailable for comment.

Assistant track coach, Keisha Dumas
agrees that the Lady Panthers are not get-
ting recognized.

“It is frustrating in the sense that the
[athletic department] does care but they
are not doing the best they can to show
their support,” Dumas said. “Sometimes
you need for them to say, ‘You girls are"
doing a good job.’”

Williams feels things are starting to
improve but still are moving too slowly.

“Since Oval Jaynes has been the direc-
tor of athletics, things have gotten a lot
better with women’s athletics,” Williams

I said.

“[Associate Athletic Director] Carol
Sprague is more involved in women’s
athletics also. So things are getting bet-
ter, but they are getting better too slow.”

Duckman
Created by Everett Peck
Airing on the USA Network

If you’ve ever wondered whether or not ducks
have teeth, wonder no more. “Duckman,” a new sit-
com on the USA network, proves not only that
waterfowl do have dentures, but also that they can
be the basis of an entertaining animated series.

Duckman is the nicotine—addicted, underappreciat—
ed father of Ajax, a brain—dead, 15-year-old surf
duck, and Charles and Mambo, a genius duck with
two heads" thatargue about Freud and Jung, Moses
and Mohammed. Duckman’s family also includes his
abrasive exercise-freak sister—in-law Bernice, who
took over the household after the death of
Duckman’s wife, and Grandmama, who does noth-
ing but sit in a clfair and ﬂatulate.

Professionally. Duckman is an exceedingly lousy
private detective. Cynical, grouchy and a bit of a
spaz, Duckman wouldn't solve a single case if it
weren’t for Cornfed, his sidekick pig who spews out

worldly wisdom in a cool, airy, Sergeant-Joe-Friday
monotone. ,

The cast is full of familiars. “Seinfeld”’s Jason
Alexander handles the title role, and Dweezil Zappa
appropriately voices Ajax. Bernice is played by
Nancy Travis (the mom from Three Men and at
Baby), and upcoming guest stars include Crispin
Glover and Teri Garr.

“Duckman” first appeared as a comic strip created
by Everett Peck, whose drawings have appeared in
Rolling Stone, among others. The series de-empha-
sizes plot in favor of parody and somewhat intellec-
tual humor. Like its predecessor “The Simpsons,”
“Duckman”’s attitude is fashionably irreverent. The
first two episodes elbow the media, religion and

modern art. (Duckman dies teiiij)oi‘z1i'ily after being
wrapped in pink plastic by an artist named "'Crisco.‘")

Also, like Matt Groening’s baby, the show spends a
good deal of time making fun of television itself.
However, “Duckman” diverges from "The Simpsons”
path in a couple of big ways. “Duckman”’s episodes
are rambling and unfocused, and the jokes and
themes don’t maintain a consistent pace as opposed
to “The Simpsons”’ neat packages of bizarreness.
Also, the writers of “Duckman” seem to intend to
give the show a serious side which may throw the

show into the proverbial cheese dip but will hopeful- ,

ly allow for a complexity not yet seen in an animated
series.

“Whether it has the longevity of Bart and Homer or
not, “Duckman” is better than most of the current
shows with actual humans in them. Although it’s not
as funny as a vintage “Looney Tunes,” its more than
worth a stop on a night spent with your remote con-
trol.

Overall the album is one of

Elliot Sharp’s interest in music
never lets him stay with one set-
ting for too long. As a result, the
New York multi-instrumentalist
winds up in vastly different
musical situations on a regular
basis.

Depending on what night you
catch Sharp in his hometown,
he might be ripping out straight
ahead blues with his trio
Terraplane, conducting a string
quartet or leading the intense
noise-rock band Carbon.

Sharp’s first Pittsburgh perfor-
mance found him in an unusual
setting of a different kind. In
October 1991, he performed an
early evening solo show at the
Rosebud. For over an hour, the
6-foot-plus bald man produced
a complex racket on a double-
necked guitar—bass and bass
clarinet, both under the influ-
ence of effect pedals.

The complexity of Sharp’s
playing was riveting, but it
made for an odd juxtaposition
with the restaurant’s swank

ambiance and the waiter with
the strolling liquor cart. One can
only imagine what the older
patrons thought of the intimi-
dating perfomier, who was clad
in black, and the sounds he
emanated. However, many peo-
ple responded enthusiastically
that night and again when he
returned with Carbon to the
same stage a year later.

Next Wednesday, Sharp will
bring Carbon back to Pittsburgh
for a performance on our own
dear campus in Benedum
Auditorium.

The venue might amuse
Sharp, who admittedly started
out as a “young science nerd”
before getting into composition
at Buffalo University in the early

  THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 24, 1994

As it goes with most com-
posers who take risks, Sharp’s
ideas met with resistance from
his professors. After performing
one of his pieces, Sharp said,
one instructor “called me into
his office and said that I put too
much sociology in my music,
that music was made to be lis-
tened to sitting in red plush
seats and my music was made
to be listened to sitting on the
ﬂoon”

The concrete elements, as it
were, of his music date all the
way back to high school when
Sharp was involved in the free
speech and anti-war move-
ments. While attending Buffalo,
Sharp was tried and later found
innocent of stabbing a security
guard during a political demon-
stration. During that time, plain-
clothes police followed him,

  

KAPLAN RULES

and he is convinced his phone
was tapped. As a result, he
admits,  lot of my music is
about paranoia.”

Much of this can be heard in
Sharp's work with Carbon, a
band whose 10-year history has
spawned a wealth of recordings
and personnel changes. Song
titles like “A Biblebelt in the
Mouth” and “LA. Law (Not a TV
Show)” provide chilling com-
mentary on the effect of politi-
cal and social problems in our
country.

Currently the band features
electric harpist Zeena Parkins
(who came to town last month
with John Zorn’s Carbon),
bassist Marc Sloan, drummer
Joseph Trump and David
Weinstein on sampler and E#

on a variety of instruments
including the double guitar-

‘ bass.

The interesting thing about
Carbon comes from the fact that
you can’t always tell who is
playing what. The bands sound
is hard and dense. The harp
slides around, intermingling
with the guitar, which
Weinstein samples and throws
back into the proceedings,
which is held together by a
warped funk beat.

As intimidating as it sounds to
those who don’t dig the ....uh,
avant-garde, Sharp doesn’t con-
sider his music as anything out
of the ordinary.

“I’ve always either played pop
music or played with it,” he
says. “The only difference

music is that its not popular.
There is no more need for an
avant-garde or for new music. I
always hated that term anywvay
because it’s like the question of,
well, ‘is it popular music or is it
unpopular?” —

Before Carbon takes the
stage, another group will push
the limits of what we consider
rock music. Boston’s
Concussion Ensemble features a
lineup of three drummers, a
percussionist, two guitarists and
bassist.

T hat’s right, no vocalist. They
don’t need one.

The septet stirs up a brew of
thundering riffs which receive a
further punch from the drum-
mers, who alternately pound
out straight beat that can level
the walls or set up a mix of
polyrhythms that go beyond
simple descriptions like “funk”

and makes you forget about the
lack of a voice.

Like Elliot Sharp. the
Concussion Ensemble eschews
monikers like experimental.
“We as a band never felt we
were different or freakish, but a
lot of people thought we were
avant-garde or world beat,”
drummer Brian Gillespie said in
Alternative Press last year. “I
think we dispelled that image
and made people realize that
we were just a really, really hard
rock band.”

A listen to their CD Stampede
indicates this. The band draws
influences from Irish tunes,
garage rock and Birthday Party-
type bass lines.

The Ensemble features a
who’s who of the Boston under-
ground scene of the past 10
years. Founding drummer
Malcolm Travis now pounds the

sorry I took so long to listen to
it. It’s phat!! But one thing about
this crew is, even though you
may have the album. you have
to buy all of the singles as well
because of the unreleased B-
sides. The B—sicle of “\Vlio
Got...“ contains the rugged track
“F**k lt lip. How Many..." con-
tai_ns the phattest track they
made (in my estimation) enti-
tled “Act Like U \\’='ant It“ (a duet
with a new group called Smif-
N-Wessun). And the new single
"I Got...” contains the new
underground flavor of "Killin

Every Nigga.” They definitely
have the formula.

The album overall is slammin’
except for some dull points and
the poor quality that makes it

Two weekends ago the Pitt
men’s gymnastics team finished
fifth in the 1994 ECAC
Gymnastics Championships
held at the University of
Massachusetts.

“We had a good meet,” head
coach Frank D’Amico said. “We
did our best. We couldn’t do
any better. I am very happy
with our performance. It was a
positive note.”

“We did the best we could
due to injuries,” Carslaw said.
“The other schools were on
fire.”

Rings was another apparatus
that the Panthers competed well
in, scoring 45.25. Youndt and
Severino led the way‘ with
scores of 9.4 and 9.2 respective-

This Friday and Saturday, Pitt
will be hosting the National
Independents Team and
Individual Championships. The
schools scheduled to compete
are the University of Illinois,
Western Michigan University,
Kent University, the College of
William and Mary, James
Madison University, Radford
University and Pitt.

According to Coach D’Amico,
Illinois should dominate the
meet. Pitt won this meet three
years ago when it was held at
Illinois.

“I am looking forward to this

weekend,” Severino said. “It
will be my last home meet, so I
want to do well.”

Besides Severino, the other
Panthers scheduled to compete
are Sweeten, Lannie, Narvaez,
Jon Shapiro, Youndt, Saleem,
Carslaw and Mike Maurer.

The team competition begins
Friday at 7 p.m., and the indi-
vidual events begin at 1 p.m. on
Saturday. Both days of competi-
tion will be held at Trees Hall.

While the men have finished
their ECAC's, the women have
completed their regular season
and now look forward to the
ECAC Championships this
weekend at the University of
Vermont.

The Lady Panthers are work-
ing hard in preparation for
ECACs. Brenda Stevens and
Robyn Senior will compete in

Bethany T oellner and Michelle

are real excited. This is like

ed head coach Debbie Yohman.

“I am really excited,” said
Buck.

“It [ECAC] gives me a chance
to try some things I didn’t
do during the regular
season.”

“I’m excited, I have never

before,” Senior said.

In their last meet of the year
this past weekend, the Lady
Panthers were defeated by
Rutgers University 183.425 to
182.925. This score was the
highest team score of the year
for Pitt.

“The team did a superb job.
We could not have done much
better,” Yohman said. “It was
devastating to be so close and
not be on the top end.”

Pitt Women ready for N W IT showdown with Gonzaga

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt women's basketball
team entered this season intent
on running more than it had in
the past.

The fast break has been a key
to the success of the 19-9 Lady
Panthers all season. The run-
ning game has helped Pitt over-
come its lack of size as well as
sparking an offense that had

sputtered in recent seasons.

Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
said that the running game will
be a key again as the third-seed-
ed Lady Panthers play sixth-
seed Gon’/.aga (20-8) in the
opening round of the National
\‘C’omen’s Invitational
Tournament at Amarillo, Texas.

“They are a well—rounded
team,” Bruce said.

“They have a good balance
between inside and

outside.”

The inside part of that bal-
ance is the main concern for a
Pitt team that has had trouble
with teams with strong inside
games.

“It always is la concernl,”
Bmce said.

"No matter who we play,
whether they are any good or
not, if they have an inside
game, that’s something we have
to deal with.”

  

Bruce said that he thinks Pitt
has a quickness advantage in
the match—up.

 are going to establish
that right off the bat,“ Bruce
said.

“We are going to run the
break on them, and we are
going to press them. We are
going to try to negate any size
that they may have by keeping
their post players out on the
perimeter, helping break the
press."

opposing guards this season,
especially late in the year.

On Jan. 30, Boston Colleges
Keriy Curran, who led the Big
East in scoring this season,
chipped in 25 points, but hit
only seven of 22 shots from the
field.

Pitt was also able to shut
down Jodi Brooks of Seton Hall
the last two times the Lady
Panthers played the Pirates.
Brooks scored only 11 points on
three—of—11 shooting on Feb. 15

“The one game we stopped
Jodi Brooks [in the tourna-
ment], we stopped two of
their inside players, Texlin
Quinney and Shamona
Marable,” Bruce said. '

“We have the ability to stop
the other team’s best guard,
yet we will have to do some
doubling up or some team
stuff to stop the inside play-
ers.”

Bruce said that the team
has put the disappointment of
not being invited to the NCAA
tournament behind
them.

“I think that is gone,” Bruce
said. .

“I think, the closer to the
game we get, we are starting
to focus on this opponent.
These young ladies are ready
to play again.”

Bruce said the Panthers are
approaching this tournament
in much the same way that
they entered the Big East
Tournament, stressing the
importance of a strong open—
ing game.

“We want to make sure we
go into this game like we did
[the conference tournament
opener against] Miami la 70-

60 Pitt victory] — with all
guns blazing. No looking
back.

“I think we have a good
chance of winning [the tour-
nament]. If we have a good
start, we have a good chance I
of winning.”

Win or lose, the Panthers
are guaranteed three games
this weekend because the
tournament has a losers’
bracket.

Pitt Notes: These will be the
final games for senior hoop-
sters Jonna Huemrich, Jill
Colabrese,Erin Maloy, and

Continued from page 7
Rutgers and ﬁnishing third was
rookie Buck (36925). Seniors
scores were a 9.175 on uneven
bars, a 9.30 on balance beam,
9.375 on floor exercise and a
9.55 on vault. This score puts
her number five on the all-time
top-10 vaulting list at Pitt.

Another highlight of the meet
was Stevens’ balance-beam rou-
tine. She scored a 9.50 after not
practicing on beam for two
weeks due to an ankle injury.

In recapping this season one
word comes up again and again
— injuries. At one time or

another everyone on the team

 

has been under the trainer’s
care. The injury bug just never
seemed to quit.

“You just have to play the
cards you’re dealt,” Yohman
said.

“We’ve done really good this
year but we’ve had a lot of bad
luck,” recapped "Battista.

One high point of the Lady
Panthers’ season is Stevens. A
consistent performer all year,
she in all likelihood will be
competing in NCAA regionals
next weekend.

“She has done a hell of a job
this year. I’m sure she will do
well,” Yohman said. I
