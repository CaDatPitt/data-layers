Perhaps no athletic affair during
the school year attracts more alumni
than the University’s annual intercol-

Saturday on the Schenley Oval, start-
ing at 1 P. M., and the entry list is
the largest on record. The best ‘col-

state will be entered. L

It is -the tenth annual affair held
by the University, being started back

The _ Alumni Secretary is _noW ar-
-ranging for Senior Registrations and
within the next week all members of
-the Senior class of all departments
will receive a card to be ﬁlled and re-
turned. A man has been selected in
each class to look after_ this registra-.
tion as it is very essential that no one
be missed. As the Dental ‘Seniors are
the first to complete their work, it
has been arranged with the class pres-
-ident, C. E. Overberger, to have the
cards ﬁlled out by all members.

Th_e_ following data is_ to be given
on the cards: Name in full, (no
initials), school and year entered, de-
gree and year same 1S granted, date
of birth, home address, name and ad-
dress of one who will always know the
address, other. degrees. and courses
(when and where taken), prep_.-sch_oo1
and class, honors when at University,
fraternity, athletics, etc. The cards
are to be ﬁlled out in ink for perman-
ent alumni record. One of the most
important records is that showing
“the address of one who will “always
know the graduate’s address.” If_we
have this, we will always be able to
keep in touch of the alumni. As a
general rule, the younger graduates
‘change-_their address often for the
ﬁrst ﬁve: or six years after they com-
plete their course. in the past we
have not,had this additional means of
locating them and many have been
lost track of.

Seniors are asked to attend to this
detail as soon as they receive their
card as it is all important.

 [N LAST _gqNr£nENcE

The third and last journalist con-
ference of the Middle Atlantic‘associ-
ation of College and School . news-
papers was held at the University last

_Friday and Saturday, and was marked

by an address on “World'Journa1ism*’
by Dr. Walter Williams, Dean of the
School of Journalism of the Univer-
sity of. Missouri. _ '

‘At the business session on ‘Friday
morning, Mr. Charles rnold, instruc-
tor in Journalism "at the University,
read a letter from the School of’ Eco-
nomics, which stated that the School
of Economics of the University of
Pittsburgh invited the conference to
meet at the University henceforth.
The School of Economics offering to
bear all the expense, also to send out
the invitations and provide the speak-
ers. In order to accept this invitation
the ‘members .of the association
thought it" advisable 'to dissolve the
association, and after a motion by one
of the delegates, it was unanimously
passed. . f
‘ The Friday afternoon meeting was
devoted to a consideration of the edi-
torial. and news’ department of school
publications. An address of welcome
was delivered by Dean J. T. Holds-
worth, of the School of *Economics.
Harold S. Downing, president of the
association, presided. Papers were
read by W. Biurdette.Cl‘endenning, of
Waynesburg college; R. B. McDaniel,
of the University.of Pittsburgh; D. F.
Graham, Dickinson ,coll_ege;' Russell
Farrel, Peabody high school; Miss
Isabelle M. C_arrol,. Meadville high
school; Maurice R. Robinson, Wilkins-J
burg high school;fGeorge Ketchum,
University of Pittsburgh, and Carl L.
Mulﬁnger, of Allegheny co1lege.- '

‘At the meeting Friday night,
George S. Oliver presided and intro-
duced Dr. Williams, who compared
the journalism of the foreign countries
with that of the United States. Dean
Williams spoke in part as follows:

“Journalism, portrait record of the
life and interests of "humanity, expres-
sion of contemporary thought, inter-
pretation of the people’s heart and
mind, is everywhere. Sometimes the
record is blurred or blotched, the ex-
pression distorted and unfair, the in-
terpretation stiﬂed and inaccurate, the
journalist who is by burn-the recorder,
advocate, buyer and seller of news,
entertainer, judge, tribune, teacher,
interpreter, public servant, has all
countries for his own. Journalism,
universal in its concern, existance and
appeal is a world profession. A \i

“Types. of journals which study 0
the world's press discovers are as
various as the peoples of the various
nations. Journals accentuate toaa de-
gree certain characteristics of _ their
local constituencies. ..They have the
spirit of’ the land. They reﬂect the

temper of thetime and place.’ Journ-

alism, in its real essence, though a

was the topic of Dr. Walter Williams,‘

Dr. Charles Knaf, Professor of Latin
at Columbia university, was an honor-
ed visitor and heard Dr. Williams
address. A

Dr. Williams said _in part, ,

“In the present. crisis, let there be
no window breaking byour press, for
the other country will send in its bill
for those broken windows. Even as
we must act with reserve and caution
and study the other country in inter-
national aifairs, so we must also con-
sider the other fellow in the every day’
walks of life. I

“We must not only consider onur.vo-
cation and the tools for that vocation
but also ‘The Other Fellow.’ There
has been much misunderstanding of
the other fellow in our land, of which
the Chinese people is a striking
example. The immense population of’
China is not understood by us because
their language and customs are dif-
ferent. We misunderstand the other
fellow because we think he is not ad-
vancing in culture. , - "

President Woodrow Wilson:

“~We, students of the University of

conﬁdence in the sagacity and pa-
tience of our President and do declare.
thatiwe ﬁrmly believe that the United
States should continue the policy of
neutrality as respects European af-
fairs that it has pursued in the. past.
We believe that occurances -such as
the ‘sinking of the Lusitania, grave
as that is, should neither tempt nor
force us into War, and that we’ should
pursue peaceful means of settlement
,rather than attempt warlike reprisals.

AN EVERY DAY CREED.

 

I would be true,

For there are those who trust me ;
I would be pure,

For there are those who care;
- I would be strong,

For there are those who suffer;
I would be brave,

For there is much to dare;
I would be friend to all——

The poor, the friendless;
I would be giving

And forget the gift;
I would be humble,

For I know my weakness;
1 would look up,

their transportation, the University
itself taking care of all other features,
including the arrangement of program
and the securing of prominent editors
and speakers of national reputation.
This unexpected piece of generosity
to the visiting delegates makes it pos-
sible tp hold larger, more representa-
tive, and more valuable conferences,
as well as extending the scope of the
work the local department of journal-
ism can do in assisting the neighbor-
ing journals.

OPEN SEASON FOR‘ EICNICS.

 

 

Tomorrow afternoon the College
will hold its ﬁnal social event of the
season when it essays the “bask of
nature” stunt in the fastnesses of
Schenley Park. ’Twill be calculated to
give the departing Seniors a last
glimpse of each other before the fatal
week. And furthermore it will give
the men in the pews one more chance
to make themselves solid with the men
behind the desks. Both of which pos-
sibilities arevery commendable. There
is little enough of espirit-de-corps in
either classes or schools on the Uni-
versity, and any occasion that offers
a potential increase in either, is to_be
welcomed. Then again, everything
which tends to break down the need-
less. and invisible barrier between
teacher and student, is a step forward.
Often that barrier is merely a case of
mutual misunderstanding, which needs
the touch of informality and the free-
dom from classroom restraint to dis-
sipate, which such an event as an all
fresco picnic gives. But whether for
the forementioned reasons or otherof
the pleasures of life, not expecting co-
education and food, the School of Lib-
eral Arts is invited to present itself
en masse or in installments tomorrow
p. m. at the Bridle Path Shelter house’.

TIMBER.

 

Vox populi approximates vox dei
when the judgment and ethics of the
people takes on a tinge of the..divine.
And that devoutly wished-for consum-
mation is of less frequent occurrence
than its 0 portunities -for exercise.
Without going into a moralistic cata-
rogue of virtues which should be _up-
permost in the desired brand of office-
seeker, just what is most commonly
in our thought when we as students
exercise our students’ right‘ of fran-
chise? What motives oftenest de-
termine us in our choice of candidates ?
What, in short, is our standard of ﬁt-
ness or non-ﬁtness, worth or unworthi-
ness, if we fulﬁll our obligations to the
extent of casting a ballot at all?

Questions like these are very
natural ones on such a day as today,
when the undergraduates of the Uni-
versity are deciding who shall hold

the positions of trust within their gift

for the twelvemonths to come. In-
difference, popularity, politics—these
are the three -main factors which re-
‘ suit in the abuse of the average vote.
And of these three, the most potent
and the least excusable is indifference.
The new system of publicity will make
it less so. There is now no possible
plea that can be advanced for the indi-
vidual who knows not the merits of
‘the candidates for whom he is voting.
It is the business of every student,
just as it is of every citizen of the
republic, to ﬁnd out who is running
for office, and if unacquainted with
characters or records, to investigate
before election. Voting by chance, be-
cause a name is ﬁrst on a list, or by
any other accidental circumstance, is
equally reprehensible. It is barely
possible‘ that in this election, in which
for the ﬁrst time, the women students
are .playing an important part as
candidates, that such admonitions as
these may not be entirely wasted on
the feminine electorate.

Popularity or mere acquaintance is
a weak enough ground at any time,
and particularly so at the end of the
year, when every one has had oppor-
tunity to see men in action in other
lines than on- the varsity gridiron. If
the hero of the crowd were in even a
majority of cases worthy of the mo-
mentary splendor that blows around
him, the case of the popularity candi-
date would be different. But unfortu-
nately it is the superﬁcial traits that
are quickest made capital of, and the
solid qualities necessary to the best
public service are seldom present in
such men.

Today the men and women we need
in office must possess honesty, faith-
fulness, and an exalted sense of re-
sponsibility. Brilliancy of brain-power,
oratory, or stage-presence are nice
things to have, but not at the expense

‘ of these other more fundamental ones.
The man who will attend promptly and
regularly the meeting of the body of
which he is a member, and give his
best endeavor to the matter in hand,
is at a premium today.

STRANGERS WITHIN OUR GATES.

"The University of Pittsburgh seized’
another ‘opportunity to be of. service
to its ﬁve million constituents in the
tri-state region when it made, through

 

 

 — the School of Economics and the de-

partment of journalism, an unusual
offer to the members of the Middle
Atlantic Association of College and
School 1 Newspapers, which held its
‘ third annual session at the University
'011f.‘ Friday and Saturday last. The
off-':e’ “was, in effect, to -take: over the

. even slightly versed in local_ lo_re,
there.could be but one association
with the name in question, viz., that
of our old friend and ﬁeld representa-
tive, erstwhile of Altoona, but now of
Pitt fame, the inimitable “Doc,” oc-
casionally prefaced by the unforget-
able handle of “Galen Edwin.”) _
Two contemporary events are bring-
ing the University into favorable
prominence throughout Western Penn-
sylvania. We refer to the “prosper-
ity carnival” being held at Motor
Square garden, where Pitt is repre-
sented by a booth, with literature and
attendants to entice the prospective
freshman, and to the trade extension
tour now in progress, being_ taken by
the Pittsburgh trade special, under
the auspices of the Chamber of Com-
merce, upon which the University is
being ably exploited by Professor
Charles Barr Robertson, director of
the extension department.

Both events demonstate conclusive-
ly the position the University now
occupies, among the city’s conceded
economic assets, and as part.of hei-
industrial, commercial and social p_ro-
gress. The local carnival is reaching
the million‘ residents of Allegheny
county proper, while the trade special’s
itinerary includes Leechburg, Vander-
grift, Apollo, Blairsville, Johnstown,
Altoona, Tyrone, Phillipsburg. Clear-
ﬁeld, Huntingdon,- Bedford, Cumber-

Connellsville, Scottdale, Mount Pleas-
ant, Latrobe, Greensburg, Jeanette,
and Irwin. The contributing territory
east and south of the city are thus
covered and the advantages of Pitts-
burgh education set forth in whirl-
wind fashion, to be later followed at
greater leisure by the summer ﬁeld
representatives. These are only two
of the innumerable unique and effect-
ive methods which are constantly be-
ing utilized by the extension depart-
ment‘, to bring the University to the
people. v

 

THE LIFE SECRETARY PLAN.

 

The foundation of the entire alumni
system at Yale, Cornell, Pennsylvania,
Columbia, and other large institutions
where the organization of graduates
is most effective is built around. the
Life Secretaries, these men being
elected before or at graduation and
their duties being to keep in close
touch with the members of their class-
es after graduation and work with the
Alumni Secretary to maintain all
records of the class, etc.

At Pitt, we have been endeavoring
for several years to get the Life Sec-
retary plan in effect, but a number of
classes have failed to follow it. This
year a special effort will be made to
have Life Secretaries elected in all
classes. Instead of” one Life Secre-
tary for the entire senior class, cover-
ing the professional and undergrad-
uate schools it will be best to have one
elected for the undergraduate schools,
College, Engineering, Economics,
Mines and Education, and one for the
Law, one for the Dental, one for the
Pharmacy, and one for the Medical
school. Five in all. Each Secretary
to Si look after the graduates of his
school or schools.

Letters will be sent to the class
presidents immediately outlining the
plan and asking them to hold an elec-
tion. It can be attended to at the
time the Senior Registration is looked _
after, this being another detail referr-

"THE FRESHMAN’S ASSEMBLY.”

 

When I ‘ﬁrst came to Pitt-, as a pro-
duct of the country schools, one of my
ﬁrst acquaintances was that of the
regular weekly University assembly.
No sooner was registration completed,
and so the door locked to prevent
escape, then I was informed that the
regular school year would be opened
that Friday with a convocation at
which all students must be present.

At the appointed hour, I left the
seemingly friendly shelter of the
double-decker and skirmished around
the hall before daring to approach the
entrance. At intervals small atoms
of humanity left their coverts with a
-rush and ducked quickly into the dark
interior. Here and there came one of
those truly great men, with proud
step and lordly mien, whom I knew
were of the dreaded species of college
professor. .

At 1ast,.fearing that my absence
would be noted and that the meeting
could not be carried on under those
conditions, history repeated itself and
by a second charge of the light bri-

. to eat again.

and removes permanently the dirt,‘

gade I gained the portals. Upon en-
trance into the auditorium, however,
I was confronted with long rows of
vacant seats, _with here and there a
freshman looking wildly about him.
Upon the platform, in front of us, was
massed a collection representing what
seemed to be all the -knowledge in the
world, for there were professors of
every known degree and dimension.

Impressed by what my eyes had
beheld and with my “ego” decreased
to one tenth its former circumference,
I dropped into the nearest seat, just
as one of the platform inhabitants
rose to speak. Later I learned that
this was the Secretary of the Univer-
sity, occupying his customary position
of speaking for the Chancellor. He
was followed by several othervspeak-
ers, all of whom sought to extend to
us a hearty welcome by recounting
the advantages to be enjoyed there-
and incidentally impressing upon the
mindsof each and every one of us
just ‘how small and insigniﬁcant he
must be. When the assembly was
ﬁnally closed with a hymn which no
one had ever met, a scared bunch of
listeners crept from their places of
concealment and ventured forth into
the paths of lights.

So it went for the ﬁrst few weeks
of school. But gradually just as a
soldier becomes accustomed to the
whirr of the bullets, we too became
hardened to the steady hum of the
ever recurring series of Presbyterian
divines, and so began to give more at-
tention to our surroundings. The
older classmen did not seem to feel so
badly over the ever recurring night-
mare of chapel hour, and the reason
was soon made_ clear. While their‘
bodies were occupying the customary
seats, their minds were far away and
no matter what the speaker was say-
ing, they slumbered peacefully until
the general stirring of the audience
announced to them that it was time

As soon as this secret was discover-
ed, Friday assembly became to me a
delight as a restful hour for the
weary student.

Y. W. C. A.

At the meeting -last Monday the
following delegates to be sent to
Eaglesmere were chosen: Helen
Burckhalter, Margurite Ekas, Lulul
Glaser, Jane Meeklin, Mary Sanner,
Mary Johnson, and Ellen Koch.

Before the election the members
listened to an excellent address which
was given by Miss Russel, on “What
Is In Thy Hand.” '

ALVIN.

 

 

The (motion picture adaptation of
Hall , Caine’s amazing story, “The
Eternal City,” will be shown at the
Alvin Theater, starting Monday after-
noon, May 24, and each afternoon and
evening thereafter at 2:15-and 8:15
respectively. Produced in Italy and
England by the Famous Players Film
Co., this picture marks’ a new era in
dramatic picturization. For many
years Hall _Caine steadfastly refused
to permit his work to be reproduced
upon the screen. During a recent
visit to England,‘ however, Adolph
Zukor, president of the Famous Play-
ers Film Co., met the distinguished
author, who became impressed by the
astonishing artistic advancement of
American ﬁlm. producing companies,
and who subsequently was induced by
Mr. Zukor to assign to him the motion
picture rights of the immortal novel.

ADDITIONAL ALUMNI NOTES.

Dr. B. F. Jenkins, 06, Secretary of
the Westmoreland county club, and
Paul G. Thompson, ’15, Secretary of
the Beaver county club, met with the
Alumni Sec_retary.Monday night pre-
ceding the Council -meeting, for the
purpose of preparing a Constitution
for the county organizations.‘ F. F.
Jordan, ’18, Secretary of the Jeffer-
con county club, had been seen prev-
iously and his views secured.

A tentative Constitution was pre-
pared and will be submitted by the

C01. 1911. An interesting letter has
been received from Norman M. Grier,
11, who is located at 5091 Cates ave.,
St. Louis, Mo. He advised that after
several efforts he has been able to
get the Pitt men of St. Louis together
for a little dinner and that it will be

iheld at Acord’s Restaurant, Wednes-

day, May 19th. S. F. Andrews, ’78,
T. C. Carhart, ’07, and several other
men were mentioned among those‘ who
expected to attend. We hope to have
a detailed report later from Grier of
this ‘get together.” These little
gatherings all help, even if less than
a half dozen attend. St. Louis isn’t
a hot bed of Pitt men at this time
by any means, but those who are
there are loyal.

Ups to Appear in the Next
‘Issue of WEEKLY.

VOTERS SHOW INTEREST.

We are printing in this issue four
more of the “Who’s Who" write-ups
of alumni who have been nominated
for the vacancies on Alyumni Council.
Ballots will go out about June 1 to
the members who are entitled to'vote
for these and for the officers of the
General Alumni association, as the
election rules state that the official
ballots shall go to the alumni not
later than 10 days before the date of

ing, as agreed on at the Council meet-
ing Monday night, is scheduled for
Friday, June 11, at 8 o'clock and will
be held at the Fort Pitt hotel.

’As has been pointed out several
times in these columns, the Alumni
Secretary suggests that those who are
paid-up alumni, and. therefore the
ones eligible to vote, save all the
copies of THE WEEKLY containing
these write-ups and then when the
ballots reach them, to read every one

ory as to the capabilities and exper-
ience of each nominee. This will help
to make Council more efficient than
ever as the Nominating committee
was very careful to select men who
they thought would serve faithfully
and show the proper interest in alum-
ni affairs The question of the best
25 in the 31 men nominated rests with
the alumni to decide at the election.

The Alumni Council is the smaller
working body of the. general alumni
body and as it grows in efficiency and
the per centage of live workers who
have the time to devote to alumni
activities, increases the proposition of
stirring up the alumni for Alma Mater
is going to be greatly strengthened.

Following are the write up’s:--

LOOKING ’em oven
~ Saturday was a bad day for Pitt,
with the defeat at State's hands Bur-
well’s injury, and Fry’s absence from
the Tech ‘-meet. V _ e

To George Hesselbacher, who
throws ’em over for -State, we give all
the praise we know how. * With his
inﬁeld and ‘outﬁeld giving forth odors
a la amembert, big George nevergave
up the ﬁght, and breezed through a
deserved winner. —

Tech was unfortunate in being com-
pelled to compete in the ﬁeld events
last Friday and Saturday. If the
track competition only had been ﬁg-
ured, the Plaid would have won by a
score of 37 to 35. Leaving Pitt's ﬁeld
winnings out of the calculation would
be like leaving Pennsylvania’s elec-
*torial vote out of the Republican total.
‘ “Stew” Gmiinbling, Pitt’s w. k.
spiked-shoe artist, is acquiring more
thanlocal fame as a baseball player,
cavorting with the Miners’ team. For
the‘ beneﬁt of the coeds we might add
that “Stew” is some fancy hand with
the needle. ‘

Since early spring,»J_oe Matson has
improved at least ﬁfty per cent in his
work behind the bat. Histhrowing to

in the Allegheny encounter, and neith-
er State nor . Allegheny- could make
way with a steal on Joseph.

Not the least of the rooter’s miseries
on Saturday wascaused by the work
of Sam Eckles as umpire. His work
on the bases was poor, and on balls
and strikes he rarely made the right
. guess. An especially bad blunder was
-in calling Beattie out at third in the
third inning, when Weber. dropped
the ball and let itroll ﬁveor six feet
from him. All this time Eckles was
gazing in the direction of the bull pen
in ri ht ﬁeld, and missed the play
entire y. ' . -

\

._Both Pitt and State had many men
caught on the bases in the battle at
Forbes Field. Each nine had a run-

in the third inning. With the bases
Jammefl, Kominars grounded to Healy
‘ who nicked Vogt at the platter. On
two ‘ later occasions, with men on
Kominars hit safely. .

“Red” Carlson is mourning the fate
of his Freshman team in losing to Ben
Avon, after a‘ winning streak of one
consecutive game. The ﬁrst-year cap-
tain claims he has the best team in the
University; and after seeing the big
fellows’ play" against State, we’re in-
clined to agree with‘. him.

' “Jimmy” DeHart had State*s inﬁeld
out of order in the third round Satur-
day when he sped. from, ﬁrst to third
on Beattie’s bunt. Robinson’s excite-
ment became too much for him, and
he ﬁred the ball‘ against the bleacher
wall-in left ﬁeld, DeHart cantering
home without difficulty. . '

The following letter was" received
by -Manager Opsion from, Manager
Dias, of the Syracuse track team:
“It gives me great pleasure to be
able to verify the records made by
Sutherland and Burwell‘ of the Pitts-
burgh team, in our dual meet last
Saturday (May 1st). ’

and fulﬁlled the throwing qualiﬁca-
tions in every respect, and the meas-
ured distance -of 124 feet and 8 inches
is absolutely correct. In regard to
Burwell, he, too, is justly entitled to
his mark of 10--1-5 seconds in the
100-yard dash, for‘he won the race
fairly in that time. ‘

“I wish to express'the pleasure of
the Syracuse management in having
entered into athletic relations with the
University of Pittsburgh, and the
hope that this relation may be fur-
thered at our dual. track meet in Pitts-
burgh next year.” V ‘

The Freshmen nine pwill‘ attempt
this afternoon to mend its broken
fortunes at the expense of the East

second game of the season against
this particular collection of baseball

the Freshmen came through with a
handsome win and are now ‘in high

The University track team over-’
whelmed the Plaid representatives in
the ‘dual meet held Saturday on‘
Forbes Field, and thus eliminated an-
other competitor; for the intercollegi-
ate championship of Western, Penn-.
sylvania. .The decisive defeat of the
W. & J. team leaves on_ly_the Penn
State men to -be reckoned with. Bur-

and was compelled to drop out of the
race. Lou McMaster broke. his own
University record for the_ pole-vault

mark by 2% inches. .

The meet was marked by many
close and thrilling ﬁnishes. Burwell,
in the 100 yard dash, : after being
penalized two yards‘ for false starts,
made up the penalty and ﬁnished ﬁrst
by almost two yards. Despite the
handicap he made the distance in
_10 1-5 seconds. The 2 mile run proved
equally exciting. In this Livermore
- of Pitt and Dockstader, of Tech, alter-
nated in holding the lead, but the Pitt
representative by a gritty ‘spurt won
out in the last ﬁfty yards.

- Gantos and Thomas, of Pitt, and Ries-
er, of Tech. Gantos was Pitt's best
bet and started out strong. The pace
was too -much for him, however, and
on the last lap he was passed by Reis-

Thomas. The distance was negotiated
,in _4 minutes 46 seconds. - x

With Langdon in unbeatable form,
-and with the whole ‘team’ displaying
some of real class, the Varsity had
little difficulty in swamping Allegheny‘
in the game on Trees ﬁeld last Wed-
nesday afternoon, the score at the
‘windup being 10 to 0.. '
' Theweather in the early part of the
day was hardly ﬁt for publication, but
the sky cleared off suﬂiciently by
game time ‘to -warrant. starting the
contest. The ﬁeld was rather sticky,
but Pitt was slowed up very little, ‘as
sixstolen bases will attest. Another
feature of the Varsity’s play was the
fact that the squeeze lay was worked
successfully three times, and was
started on another occasion, but failed
because the beneﬁciary remained
anchored on third base. '

  MEET WILL

The big Intercollegiate. and Inter-
scholastic ﬁeld and track meet held
annually. by the University ' will be
staged__ Saturday on Schenley Oval, the

letes from all the high schools, pre-
paratory schools, colleges and univer-
sities of this part of the state will be
present. Teams from Ohio and West
Virginia high school's are also enter-
ed. It is estimated that close to 500
athletes will-be entered in the differ-
‘ent events. Among the colleges listed
are Pennsylvania State, Westminster,
arnegie Tech, Washington and Jeffer-
son, and several ‘others.

This meet will dcelare the winner
of the collegiate championship in ﬁeld
and "track for Western Pennsylvania.
Pitt has’ already won over Tech and
W. & 'J., and the big ﬁght will be be-
tween Pitt and Penn. State. The up-
State boys seem to have the edge on
the Varsity but the result should be
close. Pitt is wofully malt ‘in the

men in these events it will mean a
number of sure points\for ‘them.

' The probable loss of Burwell in the
dashes is a hard blow to—Pitt’s chances.
The "colored sprinter was counted ‘up-
on to take one or two of the dashes
and'"his absence will be hard felt.
Mays and Cook aretwo good bets in
the shortdistances and should make
their opponents hurry. Livermore is
booked to win the two mile, as he has
been making the best time for this
distance in the local meets. '

Penn State has entered a full team
and are ‘out to win the meet. The
Center County college ‘always sends
down an exceptionally strong team
and the squad‘ this year is no excep-
tion. Dolin, White, and Post in the
‘sprints are amongst the best men in
the state for ‘these distances. With
Hammitt, Brown and Whiting the
Blue and White team is well supplied
with hurdlers and should win both
ﬁrsts. Mason, for the quarter, Cotton
for the half, and Garland, Schroeder,
and Hunter for the distances,‘ are
among State’s hopes. Lamb is a‘ host
in himself in the weights, and should
easily win the hammer. Pickett and
Elliott are high jumpers of no mean
ability, while Page won the pole vault
last year. Palmer and Sheehan broad
jump about the same distance.

_ Carnegie Tech will also entera full
team and are "expecting to make a’
good showing. Rieser, their crack dis-
tance man, shows" signs of much prom-
ise. ‘

W. "& J- will ‘i senda team but they
are not looked upon tomake much of
ashowing. Reich has been making
good in the pole vault. In the Pitt-
.W. & J. -meet he and McMaster tied
in this event at 11 feet 3 inches. How-
ever, McMaster has been doing much
better, and the Washington boy will
haveto hustle to‘ defeat “Lou.”

All the local high schools and pre-
paratory schools have entered teams.
Shadyside, who ‘won the Allegheny
meet will have a team entered, as will

 LREFUNION puns

  WELL UNDER 
WAY

Representatives of . Six Classes
are Working Hard to Boost
Their Affairs. .

ALUMNI DAY IS JUNE 15th. L

Considerable progress was made
during the past week in interesting
the members of the reunion classes in
the activities of Alumni Day, June 15,
and arranging for affairs by them on
that day. It now is assured that the
six youngest classes scheduled for re-
unions, will “come back’? to Alma
Mater. They are the classes of 1906,
1907, 1908, 1910, 1912, and 1914. The
“boosters” in charge are as follows 2-

1906-—F. N. Adams, 1203 Resaca
place, Northside, Pittsburgh.

I907--Prof. J. S. Lambie, Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. .

1908-H. D. Magaw, 630 16th 'st.,

. Homestead, Pa.

/

1910—J. J. O’Connor, Mellon Insti-
tute, or K. E. Davis, 421 Park build-
ing. Pittsburgh.

191 4—M. A. Follansbee, Follansbee,
W. Va. ' ' _

These representatives_ are looking
after the undergraduate departments
only—Col1ege, Engineering, Mines,
Economics, and Education. If the
members of classes of the professional
schools are planning anything, their
class officers are asked to get in touch
with the Alumni Secretary, so his
oﬂice may be the clearing house for
this entire reunion feature.

The class of 1906 men are badly
scattered and more than half of the
graduates are no longer in Pittsburgh.
Some are hundreds of miles from this
city. An effort will be made to get
many of them here June 15 for a
banquet and other activities.

Prof. Lambie of the Engineering
school is Secretary of the 1907 class
and he has kept a close tab on all the
graduates that year. Their reunion
should be something unusual.

The class of 1908 has many men
located in the Pittsburgh district and
Mr. Magaw will work up their re-
union. They have had several re-
uion affairs since graduating.

The class of 1910 has arranged for
its banquet at the Pittsburgh Athletic
association and will have “doings”
during the day, also, one being the
taking of a class picture around the
1910’ tree. Mr. O’Connor and the
Alumni Secretary are looking after
this. Prof. Daniel Carhart, Emeritus
Dean‘ of the Engineering school, has
been invited as honor guest, and has
accepted. Many of the 1910’ers want
to get back to meet “Uncle Dan,” if
He was very
popular with all the “tenners.” Let-
ters have been sent all members of
this class and many have responded.
A good turn out is assured.

The class of 1912 will dedicate a
class memorial on Alumni day. This
will be a large ﬂag pole and, accord-
ing to present plans, it will be located
on the steps of State hall. The design
is now being prepared and will have
the approval 0 fthe University archi-
tect. A fund for a class memorial
was started by the 1912’ers at the
time of their graduation and has been
held in trust until this time. L. W.
McIntyre is president of the class and
is handling the details of the reunion.

M. A. Follansbee, president of the
class of 1914, is “boosting” their re-
‘union and has his literature out to
members. As many of the ’14 boys
are around Pittsburgh and can attend,
a goodly large percentage of the class
rool is expected at the ﬁrst “get to-
gether.” This class has planned a
number of distinctive features for its
reunion. ‘

The Alumni Secretary will be glad
to assist all the “Boosters” in working
up reunions. Several of them have al-
ready had conferences and secured ad-
dress lists from him.

The classes named will likely have
separate reunions on Alumni day,
which is Tuesday, June 15. the day
before Commencement. The other
classes which are scheduled for re-
unions will be urged to at least at-
tend the Commencement banquet,

-Wednesday, June 16th, in a body as

they are so badly scattered and the
system of class organizations in those
years were,so hazy that it seems im-
possible to get them together for sep-
arate reunions on Alumni day. All
members of these classes will receive
separate letters later telling of the
Commencement banquet and urging
thir attendance. This will apply to
the graduates of the professional
schools as well as those of the under},
graduate schools. r ..

BRASHEAR.

Combining the wonderful precision more or less of the apparatus made
necessary to produce apparatus whose latthe little shop in Allegheny. Among

measurements come to within one.

millionth of an inch of “absolute ac-
curacy with a love of scientiﬁc studies
equal to that of the specialists in their
chosen lines, John Alfred Brashear,
instrument-maker to the world, as-
tronomer, collaborator of Langley in
the early attempts at ﬂying, former
director of the Observatory, and ex-
chancellor, stands forth as one of the
few really great ﬁgures connected
with the history of the University of
Pittsburgh.

Mr. Brashear was born at Browns-
ville, 'Pa., on November 24, 1840, gain-
ing what education he ‘could from the
public schools. His love of science
and especially of astronomy, was gain-
ed from his maternal grandfather,
Nathaniel Smith, who had constructed
one of the ﬁrst telegraph instruments
in this part of the state and who had
also succeeded in taking some of the
earliest dagnerreotypes. Very early
in the boy’s life, he was introduced
to the mysteries of the heavens and
taught the names of the constellations,
the study of which he has pursued for
almost seventy years. Unlike most of
our leaders in scientiﬁc lines, Mr.
Brashear lacked the advantages of a
college ‘education, and at twenty-one,
he found himself established, seeming-
ly for life, as a machinist in one of the
rolling mills of Pittsburgh. Never-
theless, he kept‘ up, at odd moments,
his study of physics and astronomy.
About this time, the study of as-
tronomy was becoming a fad with the
people of the city. Everywhere and
with all classes, the skies were being
studied and searched. With renewed
zeal for his beloved study, Brashear
with the aid of his wife set about the
construction, after his day's work was
over, of a telescope of their own. Their
ﬁrst efforts failed, but ﬁnally success
rewarded them, and soon afterwards
the little cottage was the home of one
of the largestggeﬂectors then in exist-
ence. Soon his skill at this work gain-
ed the recognition of Samuel P. Lang-
Lley, the director of the Allegheny Ob-
servatory, and the instruments of that
institution came to the machinist’s
home to be repaired. His purely scien-
tiﬁc work was also attracting the at-
tentionof the world. With the aid of
Langley and William Thaw, Brashear
was enabled to give up his work, move
to Allegheny, and set up a little shop
for making scientiﬁc instruments.
Soon afterwards, he received his re-
ward in the shape of an appointment
in the Western University of Penn-
sylvania, of which the Observatory
was a part.

From this point success came rapid-
ly. With his -improvements, both in
the process of, and accuracy in mak-
ing the rock crystal prisms, used by
Langley in his new invention of the
bolometer, the name of John A. Bra-
shear became known throughout the
scientiﬁc world as a man who com-
bined the special gifts of great manu-
al dexterity, inﬁnite patience, and a
love of precision for its own sake, in
a manner so absolutely essential for
a successful maker of the delicate
instruments used. Shortly all the lead-
ing observatories were equipped with

these productions are the instruments‘

of the bolometer, the reﬂectors of the
telescopes, Hale’s spectro—photohelio-
graph, Pickering’s prism of quartz,
which is the largest in the world; the
Mills spectroscope,‘ at the Lick ob»
servatory, and the famous “ruled grat-
ings” of the late Dr. Rowland, at
Johns Hopkins University. Nearly all
the famous observatories of the world
are equipped with Brashear spectro-
scopes.

While his prime interests has ever
been in the manufacture of his as-
tronomical instruments, _ Dr. Bra-
shear’s scientiﬁc studies have been
such as to gain for him world-wide
recognition and honor. He was given
the degree of Sc. D. by Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, and by
Princeton University in 1911, that of
L1. D. from University of Wooster in
1896, and Washington and Jefferson
College, and that of D. Eng. from the
Stevens Institute of Technology in
1912. From 1898 to 1900, heiwa's
director "of Allegheny Observatory,
and from 1901 to 1904, he was acting
chancellor of the University. A

One of the many things done by Dr.
Brashear for the city of Pittsburgh
was the opening of the observatory
to the citizens. Pittsburgh is said to
be the only city in the country where
the people are free to go -to the ob-
servatory and be shown the wonders
of the heavens without charge. Lec-
-tures were also given, explaining the
mysteries to the laymen. This spirit
of self-sacriﬁce has ever character-
ezed his work, many of the instru-
ments being produced without proﬁt
to the manufacturer in order that they
may help .in- the advancement of
science.

Dr. Brashear is a fellow of the Am-
erican Association for. the Advance-
ment of Science, being vice-president
in 1900, a member of the Royal As-
tronomical Society of Great Britain,
former president of Western Pennsyl-
Vania Engineers Society and the Pitts-
burgh Academy of Arts and Sciences,
:3. member of" the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers, British As-
tronomical Association, the Societe’
Astronomique de France, Societe’
Belge d’Astronomie, American Phil-
osophical Society, the Astrophys, So-
ciety of America, and the National
Geographic Society, and an honorary
member Canadian Royal Astronom-
ical Society. He is also chairman of
the Educational Commission of Pitts-
burgh.

One amusing story told of Dr. Bra-
shear’s ideas of precision is that con-
cerning a prospective purchaser who
desired a glass bar a yard in length
and “absolutely straight.” While de-
murring at the “absolute straight-
ness,” Dr. Brashear agreed to do his
best for two hundred thousand dollars
and then proceeded to lecture the
customer on the meaning of the word
“absolute” when applied to the mak-
ing of such materials for use in as-
tronomical and other very exact in-
vestigations. At the ﬁnish, the custom-
er compromised upon a bar coming
within one twentieth of an inch of
absolute straightness and costing
about forty dollars.

hotel, this taking the place of an even-
ing. It was felt that the members
of the association could best attend a
meeting at this hour. At that time,
the report -of the Election committee
will be heard and following it the
Council will have a short organization
meeting and elect a chairman.

The following members were elect-
ed to represent Council on the Athlet-
ic Council: A. R. Hamilton, Floyd
Rose, Laurence B. Hurst, Dr. E. T.
Chatham, C. W. Ridinger, Dr. H. W.
Heckel, Dr. F; J. Blumenschein, B. H.
Smyers and Dr. P. V. McParland.

Plans for reunions and other alumni
activities at Commencement time
were outlined by the Secretary. It
was voted to hold the annual com-
mencement banquet Wednesday night,

-June 16th, at the Hotel Schenley and

details were left to the Eentertain-
ment committee. The rate per plate
will be $2.00 for this and members of
the class who attend will receive a
free membership in the Alumni asso-
ciation and THE PITT .WEEKLY
until January 1st, 1916.

The Secretary brought up matter
of revision of the Directory for dis-
cussion and asked that Council recom-
mend to the University $1000-» be ap-
propriatéd for this purpose. A com-
mittee was appointed to confer with
the University authorities with a view
to securing this appropriation.

A vote of thanks was tendered THE
PITT WEEKLY for the additional
space devoted to alumni activities.

The Secretary recommended the fol-
lowing for membership in the associ-
ation, Council approving:

Dr. C. D. Anderson, Walter A. Bell,
A. M. Danzelli, Charles E. Dinkey,
J. Harvey Evans, J. Rogers Flannery,

PITT LUSES
T0 MICHIGAN

The strong University of Michigan
racqvueters downed the Gold and Blue
team on the Trafford City courts, four
matches to two. The Wolverines are
exceptionally strong on the courts
this year and the brand of tennis that
they displayed Monday is hard to
beat. The teams split‘ even in the
doubles, each winning one contest. It
was in the singles that the Michigan
boys secured the deciding games. Out
of four matches McEllroy was the only
Pitt man to come out on the long end.
McEllroy defeated Reindel instraight
sets, 6-4, 6-2. The crafty server from
Edgewood was in his best form and

 

  
  

had no trouble in disposing of his
opponent.

The results:

Singles-'——W. S. McEllroy defeats
Reindel 6-4, 6-2; Crawford, Michigan
won over Gaut 6-4, 8-6; Mack defeated
Haines, Pitt, 6-2, 6-0, Switzer, Michi-
gan won over Myers, 6-4, 6-1.
Doubles: McEllroy and Gaut, Pitt, de-
feated Reindel and Crawford, Michi-
gan; Mack and Sweitzer, Michigan,
defeated Haines and Myers, Pitt, 6-4,

BEN AVON WINS OVER

Last Tuesday afternoon was a fatal
period for Ammons’ charges, for his
Freshmen met with defeat at the-
hands of the Ben ‘Avon high school

The Pitt ﬁrst year men were
crippled by the absence of their hard-
hitting captain, “Red” Carlson but de-
spite this handicap they presented a

Meadows was shifted from third to
the. double “S” position and the third
corner was held down by Thomas. Be-
sides out scoring the Freshmen, Ben

having three to their discredit as
against two made by the Pittites.

Just the minute it touches

the paper, a Moore starts writing.

No fussing with it to get it going. ’

For when a Moore is closed, the pen goes
down into the ink. And it comes up moist,
ungummcd, ready to write at the first stroke.

Another thing you'll like in 9. Moore is_its safety. Drop it
in your pocket any way that's _conveni_ent~it_ won’t leak.
For when the cap screws down. it shuts up the ink chamber
bottle-tight. , ‘ .

‘ It's the kind of pen a busy man liken. because it writes rizh
away and writes RIGHT all the time. Let us show you some
of its exclusive features. Many styles from $2.50 up. .

The new wor1d’s’ journalism is the-
outcome of the new world-spirit. Man
is not made for the established order,
the’ new spirit asserts; the established ‘
order must be made or remade for
man. Civilization is a garment——if it
does not ﬁt comfortably, let us change
it. So state and church and society,
business and school and government,
are invaded with interrogations if
not with axes bypthe new world-spirit.
Of this spirit, at the same time its
creature and creator, its prophet and
‘its slave, is the. world-journalism.”
