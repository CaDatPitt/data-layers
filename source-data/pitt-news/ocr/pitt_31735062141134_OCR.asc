Tuberculosis Campaign

Injections Begin /Vlonday

A painless injection may save a person years of illness as a tuber-

culin. -

Commenting on Pitt’: anti-tuberculosis campaign, Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, director of. the Men’: Student Health service, said today, “The in-
‘ sertion of just one drop of ﬂuid beneath the skin can mean all the differ-

ence in an individual’s health.”

The campaign will be limited to two weeks. This Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday students may receive the ﬁrst injection. They must re-
turn within 48 hours for an observation of the results. If the reaction is
negative, a second strength will be administered April 21, 22, or 23. A
second negative reaction will mean freedom from the disease.

If there is a positive reaction either time, the student will be X-ray-
ed at one-ﬁfth the cost outside the University. The X-ray plate will be

read by an X-ray technician and a chest specialist.

Hours for injection will be 9:30 to 5 o’clock in the offices of the Men’s
Student Health service, 34th floor, Cathedral, or the. Student Health Ser-

-vice for Women, 2809 Cathedral.

Robert Sell and Gretchen Shutte, co-chairman of

the Senior Memorial committee have announced that

senior men and women have selected their class: gift

to be presented to the University.

The gift will be lamp posts’ to be erected along the
two walks between the Cathedral and Heinz chapel.

“The lamps will not only beautify the Cathedral
campus, but will also stand for a symbol representing
3 great senior class of the University of Pittsburgh,”

stated the co-chairmen.

Money for the lamp posts will be raised by asking
the graduating class, by means of individual letters,
sspledge at least one dollar toward the annual

3enior Memorial fund.

Last year, the graduating senior class donated to
the University a glass medallion. T he medallion is in-
stalled on the ﬁrst floor of the Cathedral at the corner
window facing Forbes street and Bigelow boulevard.
Money for this gift last year was deducted from the
cap and gown fee of each member of the graduating

class .

By JACK De BENEDICTIS

Stalling for time to whip their-
organization back into shape, and
stalling for time‘ to attempt to. de-
feat student interest in a possible
re-election, the Fraternity party,
represented by Richard Mansﬁeld,
asked the committee investigating
fraudulent voting to allow theml
 this morning to present their
decision regarding the alternatives
offered them by the investigating

The committee had requested 7 
that the Fraternity party present =
to the committee by Thursday‘ af- '

ternoon their decision of choice
between two alternative proced-
ures. A
The two alternatives were: (1)
an immediate re-election on April
,IS without any investigation 9f
fraudulent voting charges, or (2)
an investigation of all fraudulent
voting charges and a subsequent,
recommendation for action on
these charges. . ,
Background for this startling ac-
tion has been the meeting of
the student-faculty-administration
committee to investigate fraudu-
lent voting in the recent student
election.

‘The committee met Wednesday 

afternoon with student. representa-
tives of both parties and with the
editor of The Pitt News.

At that meeting the general at-
mosphere was one of compromise
and willingness to adjust on the
part of Independent leaders, and
stubbornness and unwillingness to
compromise and adjust on the part
of the Fraternity leaders.

This stubbornness and unwilling-

ness was engendered by the pecu-
liar political set-up-among frater-
nities at the present time. in order
to beat a possible re-election, Fra-

ternities must repair all the broken if C

fences in their not-so-tight po-_

litical organiation. And right now '
there are plenty of broken fences. j

There was a very deﬁnite split
in Fraternity ranks in the recent
election. Fraternity men expect in

mend this split now and thus carry it

the elections and defeat the amende-
meat at a possible re-electiml.
But they need time. And they
appear to be getting it. ‘. A
The committee stated that the
principal reason for this meeting
was to see if there was common

ground for an agreement between i

the two parties.

Independents stated that a re-
election without an investigation
was their contribution to such an
agreement. .

Fraternity men hedged, saying» 

that they would have to have‘ time
to get the Fraternity presidents to-
gether.

' Although Independents charged

that this looked like stalling, since .

Fraternity leaders had already
had plenty of time to decide what
they would do, they agreed to give

Fraternity’ men another chance to '

consult before deciding, providing
thatthis was not just more stalking.

It turned out to be.

Richard Mansﬁeld got in touch
with Dean T. W. Biddle, late Wed-
nesday evening, stating that he
could not get the fraternity presi-

dents together and have a decism 
ready before, Friday morning. Dean v

Biddle then got in touc

Lead Fraternity Teams In Title Quest.

With the season rapidly drawing
to a close, the Interfraternity mush-
ball race has been narrowed down
to a team race in both divisions.

In the top bracket, the defend-
ing champions Phi Kappa and Phi
Delta Theta are engaged in a bit-
ter battle for’ ﬁrst place. Both
squads have won four contestsand
lost one.

According to pre-season dope,
the Phi Kap aggregation was odds-
on favorites to cop the Greek crown
for the second straight .year. How-
ever, the Neville St. boys have been
playing ratherspotty ball and were
upset by the Phi Delts 2-1.

Pitcher Mike Sotak and Catcher
Frank Dax, last season’s a11-intra-
mural battery, have been the main-
stays of the Phi Kap attack

throughout the entire campaign

and have been largely responsible
for the success of the defending
champions. «
Paced by Bob Sell and Stan Val-
inski, the‘ Phi Delt nine has been
the league's most surprising entry.
Generally regarded as one of the
weaker squads, the Phi Delts have
climaxed their drive for lnterfra-
ternity mushball laurels, by upset-
ting the Phi Kaps. A

Meanwhile, Pi Kappa -Alpha

heads the “B” division with the

only undefeated team in either cir-
cuit. The PiKA batsmen have
amassed a record of ﬁve victories
against no defeats to place them
far ahead of their nearest rivals,

Pi Lambda Phi. The Pi Lam crew 1

must win all of their remaining
games while the PiKA’s must drop
their ﬁnal battle in order to gain a
tie for the division lead.

Laspada Tops Pitt Marksmen;,
Cengia Only. Regular To Return

Final official tabulations from
riﬂe headquarters revealed that the
veteran and captain Larry La Spa-
da topped all marksmen for the
season just concluded. Besides ﬁr-
ing the highest individual score of
the campaign——a, 286—La Spada
also held the top mark in seasonal
shooting average——a 280.

In the eight series ‘of postal
matches, La Spada placed ﬁrst ex-
actly six times, although being tied
twice for the honors. Other riflers
who placed ﬁrst in the matches
were Johnny Helbling, twice, and
Bruno Cengia and Bill Shuck, once
each. i '

Featuring this year’s Blue and
Gold bullet men was, of course, La
Spada, who was by far the most
consistent shooter on the squad.
The sensation of the team was
Bruno Cengia, who came up fast

ances when in the national tourna-

team with a 279.
lncidentally, Cengia’s 281 was
ﬁve points shy of the national in-
dividual record this year, scored

by Howard Chandler of Brooklyn

Final results. show that the
Panthers took twent.y—three deci-

sions while dropping twenty-one

with various foes, managing to
keep above the .500 mark. A
Those who have ﬁred for the last
time for Pitt this season are La
Spada, Shuck, and Haywood, all of
whom will graduate this month.

vestigating committee.

As a result most students will
not be informed of the decision of
the Fraternity group until Monday
morning, two days before a pos-
sible re-election’. .

Affairs do not seem to be working
against a Fraternity victory, by
any means.

A more complete report of the
committee meeting follows below.

The Aftermatli  

After an extremely close elec-
tion, Independents charged that
there had been fraudaulent voting
on the part of Fraternities, and
that they had proof of this.

Countering this charge, Frater-
nity men' asserted that they too
could produce evidences of fraud.

The charges of fraudulent voting
were immediately taken up by SFA
and an impartial investigating
committee of students, faculty, and
administration was set up and em-
powered to investigate charges of
fraudulent voting.

The committee was: Dr. . Ben
Williams, chairman; Dean Helen
Pool Rush, Mrs. Agnes Starrett,
Jean Brink, Dr. George Crouch, and
William Seyler.

The broad purpose of the com-
mittee was to recommend what
should be done about the situation.

The investigation committee had
the broad power to work out a com-
promise between Fraternities and
Independents so that an investiga-
tion would not be necessary. and,
if the two parties could not agree,

to investigate all charges of fraud-

ulent voting and rule whether these
charges were sufﬁcient to call a re-
election.

Fraternities Delay Action . .

1 The Meeting 1

Last Wednesday, the investiga-
tion committee met in an open dis-
cussion with three Fraternity men:
Al McArdle, SFA Fraternity meni-
ber, substituting for Richard Mans-
ﬁeld, reputed leader of the Fra-

-ternities; Hillard Kreimer, chair-
man of SFA elections committee
under whom the recent election was
carried out and a Fraternity mem-
ber; EdlTait, president of SFA and
Fraternity member; three Inde-
pendent leaders: Hiram Milton,
SFA member,’ Independent; Al
Icardi, SFA member, Independent,
poller of the largest single SFA
vote in election history; and Jack.
Brady, SFA member, Independent;
and Jack de Benedictis, editor of
the Pitt News.

The committee attempted to ar- .

rive at some conclusion agreeable
to both parties: either a re-election
or an investigation.

Independent leaders stated that
they would rather have a re-elec-
tion without an investigation, since
they were anxious not to harm the
reputation of those involved in the
fraudulent voting.

Fraternity Politics

But Fraternity spokesman Mc-
Ardle was not prepared to speak
for the fraternities. He stated that
before the Fraternities could take
their choice of the alternatives re-
election without investigation or
investig-ation—all the Fraternity
presidents would have to be con-
sulted.

.This.was necessary because in
Fraternity politics a pre-election
caucus must meet to divide the in-

 gain’ an

tended spoils. At these caucuses
slates of candidates are approved
-——this house getting so many men
on the voting slates, that house
getting so many.

Also the houses which will sup-
port each slate are decided on at
these caucuses, so that votes will
be divided among the candidates
equally, in this way assuring a
maximum number of candidates
elected.

—-‘Just who is to be president, vice-
president, treasurer, etc., of SFA
is also decided at these caucuses.

There was pre-election caucus of
this sort held before the recent
election, but, unfortunately for the

peace of mind of fraternities, there‘

was a split in the Fraternity ranks.
This split ispartly responsible_for
the high number of “yes” votes for
the equality amendment.

Complete Re-vote

‘ Independents agreed that the re-
election could be a complete re-
election rather than only a vote on
the equality amendment.

They agreed to it because it
would beneﬁt the Fraternities in
this way. --

Fraternity politics depend on
satisfying a number of houses. If
these houses are not satisﬁed, the

political unity of Fraternities will ,,

the threatened and perhaps split,
just as it was at the recent elec-
tion. _

The problem facing Fraternities
now is to mend that split and bring
the dissident houses back into the
fold by promising them substantial
executive posts in SFA.

Given such consideration dissi-
dent houses may fall in line and
vote “no” on the amendment. And
the Fraternities will remain in pow-
¢l'. '

If this problem is not solved,
Fraternities face probable defeat.
And so they are now stalling to
see what will happen. '

Meanwhile, if the Fraternities
agree to an immediate re-election,
the investigation committee will
recommend to SFA executive com-
mittee that such an election be held.

SFA executive committee laid
plans yesterday to meet this event-
uality by appointing a committee
to superintend such an election if
it came up.

If Fraternities choose to invite
an investigation of fraudulent vot-
ing, the investigating committee
will proceed with closed hearings of
fraud charges and on the basis of
the validity of these charges will
recommend further acti_on.
