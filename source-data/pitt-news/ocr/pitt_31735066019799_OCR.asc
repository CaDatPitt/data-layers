Two banners reading ”Earth
Peace, Not Starwars” and
”Divest War” hung in front of
Carnegie Mellon University's
Dougherty Hall yesterday as part
of a rally for peace.

The Duncan and Porter House
Spiritual Affinity Group, a Pitts-
burgh organization dedicated to
taking in homeless persons,
kicked off a week long, 24 hour
vigil to expose the university's
military contracts on campus.

The vigil was organized by
Vince Eirene, founder of the Dun-
can and Porter House and a

member of the New Student Net-
work, and those in attendence in-
cluded CMU students, professors
and any one who has an interest
in peace, according to Eirene.
Eirene said that the vigil will
conclude at 8 a.m. on Friday
morning with a march from the
CMU campus to the Software En-
gineering Institute followed by a

Survey finds SGB services unused

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

A large majority of Pitt students
does not make use of Student
Government-sponsored services,
a recent Student. Government
Board survey revealed.

More than 75 percent of the
respondents to the survey said
they had never put a suggestion
in an SGB suggestion box, used
the SGB taxi service, attended the
Friday night nightclub in the Con-
course, or used the SGB-
sponsored legal service.

The survey also revealed the
majority of students would favor
the establishment of a late-night
snack bar in the Towers Lobby
and the addition of more campus
phones. The area most favored
for more phones is the Cathedral
of Learning, according to the
survey.

SGB member Tanya Jackson,
who conducted the survey, said
the results will be turned over to
the respective board members
who are working on related
projects.

Jackson was assisted on the sur-
vey by the University Office of

iMeasurement and Evaluation.

Although only 315 students were
surveyed, the results are an ac-
curate representation of the stu-
dent population because of the
diversity of the respondents, Jack-
son said.

Based on the number of stu-
dents who answered each ques-
tion, the specific responses on
major issues were as follows:

0 Have you ever put a sugges-
tion in an SGB suggestion box?
”Yes,” 4.8 percent; ”No,” 94.6
percent.

0 Have you ever used the taxi
service? ”Yes,” 21 percent;
”No,” 77.5 percent.

0 Do you feel there is a need
for a place to snack late at night
in the Towers Lobby? ”Yes,” 64.4
percent; ”No," 32.1 percent.

0 Have you ever used the Pitt
Basketball Shuttle? ”Yes,” 29.8
percent; ”No,” 68.9 percent.

0 Have you ever attended the
”Fri day Night Live” at the Con-
course? ”Yes,” 15.6 percent;
”No,” 83.9 percent.

0 Have you ever used the legal
services provided by the Student
Government Board? ”Yes,” 4.8
percent; ”No,” 90.8 percent.

0 Do you feel there is a need
for more campus phones? ”Yes,”
79.7 percent; ”No," 18.5
percent.

0 Do you feel that more com
puters are necessary to serve the
needs of the students? ”Yes,”
48.8 percent; ”No,” 12.4
percent.

In addition, 56.5 percent of the
students found street lighting on
campus to be adequate and 55.2
percent denied a security
problem on campus.

In other Student Government
business, Robert Williams
resigned his position as Affirma-
tive Action Committee Chair-
person.

”I just have too many time res-
traints in my everyday schedule,”
Williams said. ”I’m not able to
fully dedicate myself to the job
and rather than hurt the commit-
tee, I'd prefer to recommend a
replacement.”

Williams recommended com-
mittee member Sang Hong to act
as chairperson until a new chair
can be selected in the fall. The
board approved Hong unani-
mously. Hong was not present at
the meeting. In a phone interview
last night he said, ”I’m disap-
pointed Rob couldn't finish his
term and I'm sorry to see him
leave. I just hope I can do a job
comparable to the one he's

Libertarian

By Jason Hillman

”Can you think of anything
more boring than George
Bush and Michael Dukakis?
This is the most boring elec-
tion in recent history,” said
Ron Paul, Libertarian
presidential candidate.

Paul spoke to Pitt students
last night at the David

; Lawrence Hall, stressing that
‘the present Democratic and
Republican candidates are not
addressing the problems of
society.

”We [the Libertarian party]
have a message. We have an-
swers to today's problems,”
said Paul. ”This country and
the [Democratic and Republi-
can] parties are bankrupt: They
have nothing left to offer.”

NSN to be
recertified
by Student
Activities

By Brendan Kevenides

Staff Writer

The recently suspended chart-
er of the New Student Network,
a campus human rights organiza-
tion, will be reinstated on Friday
April 15th, according to Joseph
Cavalla, Director of the Office of
Student Activities.

The NSN was suspended by
the Office of Student Activities in
late March on charges that it had
failed to submit the proper forms
concerning a shanty built on the
lawn of the Cathedral of Learning
and then failed to disperse the
structure when asked to do so,
according to Cavalla.

”My recommendations may
have been too harsh,” said
Cavalla.

Cavalla explained that he
reviewed the case with his staff,
and because the group did make
an attempt to file the proper
forms, he said they should be
given another chance.

“ 

My recommenda-
tions may have been
too harsh.

— Ioseph Cavalla

Cavalla added that despite his
reconsideration, the NSN will be
required to follow the procedures
necessary for all organizations at
the University of Pittsburgh. ”This
does not mean that they should
not adhere to the rules,’’ said
Cavalla. ”They need to obey
them like everyone else.”

He also said as far as he knows,
the university has never re-
certified a group so soon after its
suspension.

Cavalla said he never met with
Pitt president Wesley Posvar con-
cerning this issue but that Posvar
did suggest that he meet with
NSN vice president John
Ratchotte.

According to NSN president
Angie Hirsch, ”Once we heard
we were re—certified we didn't ask
too many questions.”

Cavalla said although the NSN
petitioned students for re-
instatement, the reversal of his
decision was not due to outside
pressure.

Hirsch said the NSN will hold
a meeting next week to decide

I the group's future.

Israel deports 8 more Palestinians to Lebanon

JERUSALEM —— Israel Monday
deported eight more Palestinians
to Lebanon,_ saying they incited
anti-Israeli protests. Leaders of the
four-month uprising in the oc-
cupied lands called for a ”day of
firebombing” later this month.

The army said five of those
deported were from the Gaza
Strip and three from the West
Bank. .

Israel deported four West Bank
Palestinians on Jan. 13, sparking
protests of the action as a viola-
tion of the Geneva Conventions
governing the treatment of
citizens in occupied zones.

The army said deportation ord-
ers had been issued for 12 other
Palestinians from the territories
occupied by Israel in the 1967
Middle East. War. The Palestini-
ans who were ordered to be
deported may appeal.

Israel has deported more than
1,000 Palestinians since 1967.

Six of the 12 ordered deported
are from Beita, the site of a clash
between Israeli teen—agers and
Palestinians. Two Arabs and an

Israeli girl died in the melee.

I

Also Monday, Arabs in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip shut-
tered their stores and stayed
home from jobs in Israel under
PLO orders.

Hijackers kill another

hostage; demand fuel

LARNACA, Cyprus — Arab
hijackers of a Kuwait Airways jet
killed a hostage Monday and
tossed him onto the tarmac, after
threatening to slay a member of
Kuwait's royal family.

The gunmen said the dead man
was a ”Kuwaiti officer.” He was
the second man killed by the
hijackers, who hold nearly 50
people aboard the plane.

Doctors said the side of the .

man's face was badly injured,
possibly because of a beating. He
had been shot at least once in the
head.

The hijackers warned they
would take ”more dangerous
steps” if their demand for fuel
was not met by Cyprian officials.
They earlier said they wanted to
fly to a ”neutral country.”

ment concerning technological
research at the SEI. Greenberg
said that this policy permits the
Defence Department to review
all material coming out of the SEI
and decide whether the informa-

’’It doesn't seem possible that

tary should be involved with a
school like this,” said Karla Ivan-

the only reason that the institute

Feminist runs for Senate

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

Poised on a platform of wom-
en's rights, human needs and in-

creased funding for higher

education, feminist Jeanne Clark
is hoping to become Western
Pennsylvania's first femalelstate

senator by upsetting both

Michael Dawida and incumbent
James Romanelli for the 43rd Dis-
trict seat.

A former director of the Nation-
al Organization for Women,
Clark has spent the last 20 years
trying to convince all women to
become active in the political
process.

”We need people who are ad-
vocating what the majority of the
people want,” Clark said. ”We

need people who are going to ad-

vocate raising the minimum
wage, and [who are] not trying to
grab their own pay raise first.”

Clark also said that women
have the right to have abortions
and believes the legislators need
to put more money into these
programs ”and not try to punish
young girls and poor women for
getting pregnant.”

Clark went on to say that she
has gotten favorable response
from college students and how
unfortunate she thinks it is that
the present system of government
tends to ”disenfranchise” them.

In conjunction with her desire
to involve students with politics,
Clark set up a booth in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, offering students
a convenient place to register for
the presidential primaries.

’’It’s so important that students

are active, because they really are
concerned about the future,” she
said. She added that she felt to-
day's students are more propor-
tionately active in the issues of
today than even those of the late
'60s and early 705.

Clark also favored an increase
in the minimum wage. ”You
can't live on minimum wage,”
she said.

According to Clark, ”Pennsy|—
vania is 49th out of 50 in fund-
ing for higher education. That's
an outrage. Why, because you
were accidentally born in Penn-
_sylvania or you live in Pennsyl-
vania, should you have to pay
$10,000 to go to medical school
at the University of Pittsburgh?”

Clark is gaining support across
her district, and in addition, she

According to Paul, more
government results in less free-

and the conservatives defend part

 of it, but nobody defends the

what the worst goverment can
be.

’’I think there have to be studies
done,” said Pawloski. ”[Legaliz-
ing drugs] is a very radical thing
and would be very hard to push
to the American people.”

government],” said Paul Strifler,
a senior. “I don't think Dukakis
and Jackson's ‘more government’

theory can work.” ’ I

no longer going to be a missile in Reagan's demonstrably limited
rhetorical arsenal. Now, horror of horrors, abuses ofcivil rights
elsewhere in the world, possibly within the sphere of Ameri-
can influence, will be dealt with more harshly. Bad news,
indeed. .
Reagan was said to be ”very pleased”’with the Soviets’ de-
cision to withdraw their troops, even though Mikhail Gorbachev
plainly stated that the truce was not a ”gift to Mr. Reagan.”
Within Afghanistan, there is still a sizable faction of rebels,
fighters now partially funded by the United States, who con-
sider the official Afghan government little more than a puppet
of Moscow. Those rebels have stated that they will refuse to
recognize the accord, and that they will continue fighting as
they have for the past seven years.
In Moscow, a spokesperson for the Soviet negotiating team
said that any ’’internal disputes” would be handled by the Af-
ghan government. In essence, it seems that the Afghans have.
been given at least some of their rights to self-determination
back. -

~ Reagan, in the twilight of his presidency, has expressed op-

timism for the May 29—June 2 summit meeting with Gorbachev.

As a result of the tentative accord, he said, there will be an im-
provement in East-West relations.

The war in Afghanistan is by no means over. There is still

a significant population who are disillusioned by the present

government, and there is no reference in the peace accord to-
the interests of that group. They had no part in the negotiations. ,

It is commendableithat the Soviets have decided to end their
direct involvement in a foreign war. Again, the lesson that for-
eign involvement in a civil war can lead to disaster was
reaffirmed, this time at the cost of more than 100,000 lives.
Truly, a high price to pay for an education that history tells us
will probably be ignored.

Recertification for

' a very good group

I

As of Friday, the New Student Network will once again be
a certified student group. After ”reviewing his decision,” Joe
Cavalla, director of Student Activities, decided to once again
recognize the NSN as a legitimate student organization.

We feel that this decision by Cavalla was a good one, and
one faithful to the premise that a university should be a place
for students to try to increase their awareness of the world sur-
rounding them and to explore different possibilities for having
a positive impact.

It is regrettable that there was ever a dispute _over the status
of the NSN. Now, however, with that matter hopefully dis-
patched, the NSN can get on with the good work they have
done thus far in aiding the homeless and poor.

Legalization of pot a bad idea

I would like to offer Paul Anater
a few comments on his ”Wa|king
by Moonlight” column of Thurs.,
April 8.

V Why should we stop at legaliz-
ing marijuana? Let's legalize
crack, cocaine, LSD and all the
other illegal ‘drugs. That way
more people will have access to
them, their.usage will increase,
and instead of having drunk
drivers killing innocent people,
we can let people who are
stoned, tripping or wired join in
the fun. Even though you may ad-
vocate the ”responsible" use of
drugs, many users won’t bother
to think beyond satisfying their
hedonism. Legalization would do
far more harm than good.

You said that you avoid people
who don't use pot. This is a very
narrow perspective. In avoiding
people who choose to stay
straight, you are denying yourself
the positive influence of count-
less worthy people. I know many
such people who consistently
avoid drugs, and they are among
the most talented, creative and

, exciting people I've ever met and . r

they are excellent friends.

Some of my friends use pot,
and although I don't like their
choice, I accept it. In return, they
accept my choiceto not use it or
to avoid them while they're get-
ting high. Believe it or not, there
are more people out here saying
”No” than you may care to
admit.

As for drugs deserving credit for
artistic excellence, you are mis-
taken. If drug usage by the artists
you mentioned is the source of
the quality of their works, then
every junkie and doper would be
tu-rning out works of the same
caliber as ”The Raven” or ”Sgt.
Pepper.” Coleridge, Poe and the
Beatles produced great works be-
cause they are talented artists, not
because they were on drugs. As
for the ”good” things drugs
produce, ‘Coleridge died a lone-
ly madman confined to his dwell-
ing by his own request. You‘,
Paul, may smoke pot until you
sprout cannabis leaves on your
extremities if you think it will
help you to be a great writer.
Meanwhile, I won't hold my

Supercilious I misinformation,

I am outraged after reading
Paul Anater’s ode to the pleasures
of pot. It reflected absolutely no
understanding of the enormity of
the perils of addiction. What was
given was misinformation
clothed in a ‘hey man —— cool”
style.

I suggest that Mr. Anater attend
a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.
It would be an eye-opener, and
might even savelhis life. At the

very least he might thinkﬁtwice »

and do a little research before

tossing off more supercilious_ ar-{

ticles.

Looking folrla reason I

Editorfs note: The following
letter is a response to Mark
Brown's column of April 8.»

What was the real purpose of
your article on Michael Chabon
and his book The Mysteries of
Pittsburgh?

Your article was by no means
a critique or review. Normally,
one reads the material before one
passes judgment on it. It seems
that you did the opposite. You
passed your judgment on
Michael Chabon, his novel and
its success somewhat blindly,
despite the weak disclaimer you
inserted at the end of your article.

Could it be that your real inten-
tion was to incite reaction from
those in the community who hap-
pened to like The Mysteries of
Pittsburgh? Or maybe your pur-
pose was to stir up some feelings

o_f_pity for yourself among the

readers of The Pitt News over
your lack of meaningful literary
achievement.

Could it be that you are afraid
to read the book? Yes, there is a
chance that you might like it, and
maybe you'll realize that your
own writing is lacking in com-
parison.

Whatever the reason, Mr.
Chabon’s-novel is more than a

’’drawn out drama over whether“

the main character turns queer or
not” that you referred to it as. I

‘think that you'd realize that if you

took the time to read it. The book
is an insightful look at the dynam—«
ics of human relationships and

the changes one undergoes as «

one’s life takes a‘ new direction,

such as leaving college.
Working in a bookstore, I have,

come into contact with many

opinions on The Mysteries of

Pittsb_urgh— opinions both good

and bad. At least these opinions’.

have a basis: they come from‘

people who,have read the book;

And please, not every writer inf
town is ”eating his spleen out” in
envy over Mr. Chabon’s successf
Even your generalizations have’?
no substantial basis. ,
So, please, Mr. Brown — next-
time, do your homework and
don't belly ache so much.

‘Al round of I applause

As a Pitt graduate student I am
distressed that the university
would expel from campus a
group dedicatedto helping the
homeless because they would
not tear down a structure that ap-
parently bothers some people.
Why? One never knows, and we
cannot judge other people's mo-
tives but maybe it did remind
some of us ”too much” of the
homeless.

Instead of expelling the group
from the campus, maybe we
should be giving them a round of
applause for their concern and for
their doing this loving,-Christian,
Jewish, humanitarian, etc. work
that any committed believer or
non-believer should be proud of.

Pirates’ policy leaves press out in left field

Have you seen any of the_cur—
rent national and local maga-
zines? Whether it's Inside Sports
or the Pittsburgh Press Sunday

Q Magazine, nearly every periodi-
cal has an article on Syd Thrift.

and his revamped Pittsburgh
Pirates.

As everyone well knows, the
Bucs finished strong last year,
winning 27 of their last 38 games
and finishing fourth in the Na-
tional League East with an 80-82
record. Not so great, but for the
Bucs, it was a new beginning af-
ter three years in the East cellar.

The Pirates continued their suc-
cess early this season, finishing
their first road trip at 3-2, and

3‘ defeating the Philadelphia Phil-

lies 5-1 last night at Three Rivers
Stadium in the home opener.

In the wake of this miraculous
turnaround, the media has
proclaimed that the Pirates could
be the up and coming team.
Pirate manager Jim Leyland
agrees that the young Bucs are on
the rise, but fans shouldn't be too
optimistic about the Pirates’
chances to advance in the pen-
nant race.

Maybe the Pirate front office
should take a cue from Leyland.
The media relations department
has deemed the Pirates the most
valuable commodity in Pitts-
burgh, so much so that they have
denied press passes to the student
media for opening night,

weekend games and any game in
June, July and August.

These rules apply to all col-
leges wishing to obtain passes to
Pittsburgh home games.

When asked why, a Pirates
spokesperson said, ”That’s just
our new policy.”

What's going on here? Two
years ago, when the Pirates lost
102 games, they couldn't pay
people to watch a game at the
stadium. Now, media relations’
”new policy” limits student me-

Sophomore Adam Walker is one of the favorites for the starting tailback position.

dia to two passes per approved
game. College newspapers can-
not cover games of their choice.

The Pirates also have declared
the clubhouse and press box off-
limits to student media. Game
stories are written from the
stands, and all interviews with
players must be done before the
game.

The Pirates are definitely hot
material in this town and to the
baseball world in general, but
they've taken it a little too far. The
Pitt News is willing to give the
Pirates fair, consistent coverage,
but the Bucs feel they have ar-
rived in the big time. Why deal
with the low man on the totem
pole when they can go right to

the top? I'm sure the Pirates did
not limit coverage for The Pitts-
burgh Press or Post-Gazette.

The Pitt News is the third- lar-
gest paper in Pittsburgh with a cir-
culation of 16,000 four days a
week, and there is absolutely no
reason to censor our readership.
College students want to know
about the Pirates just as much as
the general readership of Pitts-
burgh's dailies.

And it is unquestionably true
that college students constitute a
large number of those who regu-
larly attend games at the stadium.

Maybe the Pirates feel there
will be no one around campus in
the summer to read feature arti-

Competition tough for
running backs during
spring football drills

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

When Craig Heyward decided
to pass up his senior season of
eligibility to play pro football, it
seemed the Panther ground game
might suffer.

Heyward — the second-leading
rusher in the nation last season —
was a workhorse for the Panthers,
rushing 387 times, while quarter-
back Darnell Dickerson was se-
cond with 45 attempts. In fact,
Heyward received the call on 65
percent of all rushing calls.

Right now, I'm sur-
prised. We're a lot bet-
ter now than I thought
we would be at this
point.

—Tommie Liggins

With Heyward out of the pic-
ture, someone will have to
emerge as the leading candidate
from a young but talented group.

At tailback, sophomore Adam
Walker is the leader of the group.
He rushed for 214 yards (5.6
yards per carry) last season in
limited action. Although Walker
may be the heir apparent at tail-
back, it’s something he feels he
has to earn.

”I feel it's mine, but I still have
to work for it,” said Walker. ”The

Stouffer may be pushing luck with

Here is the scenario:

You are a former quarterback
of a weakling Big Eight school, a
pretty good one at that, but cer-
tainly not a highly publicized
player, one the scouts drool over
conditionally.

Last year, you were selected
among the Top 10 picks in the
NFL draft. This comes as a sur-
prise to you, as you were consi-
dered by many pro scouts to be
no higher than a shaky, low first-

round selection, if not a solid
second-round selection.

The team that picks you is not
exactly in a desperate situation
when it comes to its quarter-
backs, but the team's starter did
have an unimpressive campaign
the previous season, and so play-
er personnel is just hunting for
some backup security at the po-
sition.

The team originally offers you,
oh, say a multi—year deal worth

THOMAS
DANYLUK

well over $1 million. Do you sign
eagerly, thinking that the team is
initially paying you more than
you're worth?

Or do you, possibly out of
some sense of pride and at the
prodding of your agent, refuse the
offer, claiming you should be

paid more like a Top 10 selection
normally would be, and hold out
for more cash? For over a year?

When the St. Louis (now Phoe-
nix) Cardinals selected Kelly
Stouffer as the sixth pick overall
in last year's NFL draft, many
analysts were highly surprised at
the move. First of all, the team al-
ready had Neil Lomax, a Pro
Bowl performer in 1985, over
center, and although his perfor-
mance in 1986 was anything but

position is not a given thing. The
decision is up to the coaches, so
I'm just going to give it all I've
got.”

Although Walker spent most of
last year on the sidelines watch-
ing Heyward, he feels he may
have learned a thing or two.

’’It didn't hinder me. It was a
learning experience for me,” said
Walker. ”I learned to see what. he
did well and I tried to contribute
what I could. I felt I complement-
ed him as well.

”I’m just ready to go,” he
added.

Two other players, sophomore
Brian Davis and redshirt fresh-
man Ronald Redmon are also in
the running for the top spot. Da-
vis rushed for 298 yards (5.0
yards per carry) and three touch-

downs as a freshman in 1985, but -

hasn't played since. Nonetheless,
Walker knows Davis will give
him some stiff competition. '

”C0mpetition always brings
the best out of me,” noted Walk-
er. ”It’s great competition for me
and it's great competition for
him.”

Tommie Liggins, running backs
coach, agrees that the competi-
tion has made spring drills a lot
more beneficial to the team.

”Right now, I'm surprised.
We're a lot better now than I
thought we would be at this
point,” said Liggins. ”With Brian
Davis, it's going to make us a lot
better. There's more competition
between our top three tailbacks

impressive, the Cardinals still had
greater needs at other positions.

Secondly, Cliff Stoudt, a form-
er Pittsburgh Steeler and USFL
castoff, was a relatively solid, if
unspectacular, backup for L0-
max, so that's two quarterbacks
the team already had under
contract.

Thirdly, Stouffer, although

cles and game results. Although
it's true that enrollment does drop
after April, The Pitt News still has
a circulation of 10,000 once a

burgh does offer summer courses.

By limiting access to games
and players, the Bucs are short-
changing themselves. They will
receive less press, and although

be the least of their worries, the
Pirates seemingly should take any
opportunity for print that presents
itself.

The Pirates have shrugged off

and, what's more, easily con-
trolled. By the same token, col-
lege papers have the right to
reduce or eliminate coverage of
the 1988 Bucs.

Pirates don't want us at the stadi— ‘

um, or because the student press
decides it doesn't care to be there
due to their policies, there will be
decidedly less coverage of the

mer and next fall.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April I2, I988

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's track team
dominated the opposition at the
Panther Relays on Saturday at Pitt
Stadium. The Panthers proved to
be invincible on their home track,
taking firsts in 11 out of 17
events.

, Terry Wellman doubled in the
‘dashes for Pitt. In addition to cap-

turing the 100-meter dash '

(10.76), Wellman finished first in

the 200—meter dash (22.37).
The Panther’s Pat Malone cap-

tured the 3000—meter

steeplechase in a time of 9:25.59.
Teammmates Craig Woshner,
Tom Boggan, Dave Hackworth,
John Hartman and Joe Warner
made a clean sweep of the top six
places for Pitt in the event.

Eric Cannon captured the
110-meter hurdles for the Pan-
thers in a time of 13.67 with Cal-
vin Holmes, George Ifill and
Norris Coleman taking the next
three spots.

Pitt's Rowan Mighty (49.17)
dominated the field in the
400—meter run, winning by more
than two seconds.

In the 400-meter hurdles, the

Panther’s Chop Burton (53.39)

, led a 1-2-3 sweep by Pitt. Fellow

Pitt tracksters Coleman and Cor-
nell Brown finished second and
third, respectively.

Keith Dowling won the
5000-meter run in a time of
15:20.95 for the Panthers while
teammate Joel Ninos took runner-
up honors.

Two Pitt relay teams took top
honors. The 400—meter relay
team of Cannon, Ifill, Mighty and
Dave Price (46.79) finished first,
as did the 1600-meter relay team
of Mighty, Holmes, Burton and
Ifill (3:16.33).

In the field events, Mike Stra-
tos hurled the javelin 182-feet-six-
inches in winning the event for
the Panthers. Pitt's Sam Lyons
finished third with a throw of
169-1.

Pitt's Jeff Quinn, Kevin Gennu-
la and Mike Remaley took the top
three spots in the discus throw.
Quinn's winning effort was
129-feet-1‘/2-inches.

Several Pitt athletes came out
of the meet a little sore, but the
biggest casualty was All-
American candidate Price. He
suffered a slight hamstring strain
and is definitely out of action for
this week's meet at the Universi-

Relays

ty of Tennessee; he may miss
next week's meet as well.

Despite the misfortune that be-
fell one of his top runners, Pitt
coach John Vasvary felt the meet
was beneficial for a number of
reasons. ”I felt like we did get a
lot of good things done. It was
nice to run on our home track
and avoid the 10-hour bus rides
we often have coming back from
away meets,” noted Vasvary.

”And, it was nice to have a
mental break, away from the kind
of intensity we have experienced
at the Atlantic Coast and Coloni-
al Relays,” he added.

scored. Shortstop Mike Claus was
also one for two, with a double.
Right fielder Sean Alber was one
for two with two RBI.

In the second game, Pitt won
9-8 in 10 innings. Bill Sherbon-
dy hit a three-run homer, his sec-
ond of the game, in the top of the
tenth inning to give the Panthers
their third win of the season.

Pitcher Paul Ponzi went seven
innings, allowing six runs (one
unearned), seven hits, five walks
and striking out three batters.

Pitcher Steve Hoffmann
stepped in and earned his second
win of the season , giving up two
earned runs, two hits, six walks,
and two strikeouts in two innings.

Doug Jackson got the first save
of the season for Pitt by coming
into a bases loaded situation and
getting the Panthers out of a jam.
Jackson gave up a sacrifice fly
and got the next batter to hit into
a double play to end the game.

Among those with hot bats for
Pitt were Sherbondy, who went
three for five, including his two
homers, and scored three runs
with four RBI. Designated hitter
Brian Lohman went two for three
with a double, one run scored
and one RBI. Claus went two for
ﬁve with one double and one run
scored.

In the third game on Sunday,
the Panthers lost 9-7. Rich Low-
man pitched six innings, giving
up five earned runs, ten hits, two
walks and one strikeout. Jackson
pitched one and one-third in-
nings, giving up four runs, one
earned run, two hits, and walk-
ing four. Jackson got the loss.

”They're pushing one another.
I see a big improvement,” added
Liggins.

At fullback, the Panthers have
Dan Crossman and Steve Aungst.
"Both were defensive backs, but
both can do the things we ask for
at fullback. I feel they're doing a
great job," said Liggins.

Crossman moved to the other
side of the line when former run-
ning backs Louis Riddick and
Prentiss Wright moved to defen-
sive back.

"I like it, actually,” said Cross-
man. "They both went over there

so I came over here because the
position was open, so I'm starting
now and working hard.

"I feel real good. Things are go-
ing real well,” Crossman added.

"Another kid who's got poten-
tial to do something is [sopho-
more] Shaon Berry. Those guys
are doing a real good job," Lig-
gins added.

Liggins feels any running back
with some skills can make the
team, but not having a back like
Heyward will make the other
backs’ performance more visible.

"If a running back comes to
this school with any kind of talent
— with the offensive line we have

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April I2, 1988

 

— he can be good,” said Liggins.
"He may not get the tough extra
yards when a block breaks down.

”The way Craig plays, when
you're 275 pounds, you're like
another lineman coming on.
We're not going to be able to do
that, but I think we'll have more
breakaway runs than when we
had with Craig,” Liggins added.

As a whole, Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried feels the inexperience
has shown so far, but the deter-
mination is there.

"The young guys are making a
lot of mistakes, but it's early in the
spring. They're all doing real well
and they're all giving us solid
play," said Gottfried.

The Panthers had 14 hits in this
game. Lohman went three for five
with two doubles, one run scored
and one RBI. Lamanti went two
for three, with one run scored
and one RBI. Sherbondy hit two
of four with a triple, two runs

Head coach Bobby Lewis said,
"The third game was seesaw
back and forth. It could have

gone any way.”

Over the three games, the Pan-
thers collected 33 hits. Several
Panthers brought up their batting
averages. Sherbondy is now hit—
ting .429, with Lohman right be-
hind at .426. O’Leary is hitting
.358, with Alber at .345 and

Coach Lewis said, ”We have

Ohio State defeats
volleyball team in
weekend scrimmage

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's volleyball
team hosted the Ohio State Lady
Buckeyes in a scrimmage held on
Saturday. The Lady Panthers were
defeated 3-0.

In the first match, the Pitt wom-
en were defeated 2-O. The last
two matches were closer, but the
Lady Panthers went down to
defeat by identical 2-1 scores.

The scrimmage takes place
each spring and is the volleyball
team's equivalent to the "football
team's Blue-Gold game. It gives
Pitt head coach Shelton Collier
and his assistant, Sue Hoover, a

, chance to evaluate returning

players as well as plan for the fall.

Collier minced no words in
evaluating the progress made by
his team this spring. "We lost
four seniors [Noreen Coughlin,
Louise O’Shaughnessy, Lisa
Stewart and Krista Ziener], and
we haven't come close to replac-
ing them.

"Perhaps our four new incom-
ing recruits will step in next year,
or perhaps several of our current
players will make dramatic im-
provements over the summer and
be ready to compete nationally,"
he added.

Collier started his evaluation of
individual players’ performances
in the scrimmage at the setter po-
sition, a position that was so apt-
ly handled by All-Big East
selection O’Shaughnessy. "The
setting position was split between
freshman Jenelle Lantagne and
junior Lori Silk. I felt both setters
did well in the scrimmage. We
have put in a new offense and
they handled it well,” ‘noted
Collier.

However, Collier did not rule
out the possibility that incoming
freshman Deirdre MacAulay
might be moved to the setter po-
sition. "MacAulay is a power hit-
ter now, but we may convert her
to setter, depending on what will
make the team strongest next
year," he added.

All—American candidate Denise
Frawley made a strong showing
at the scrimmage. Collier had this
assessment of his junior outside
hitter's play: ”She will have an
opportunity to be a legitimate All-
American next year if she has a
superior season week in and
week out. She continues to show

signs that this may be the case. A

lot depends on her."

Freshman Michele Adamson
and junior Nora Mulvihill were
Pitt's middle blockers for the
scrimmage. Adamson is attempt-
ing to follow in the footsteps of
Coughlin, who always played her
best against top competition.

Stepping into the No. I outside

hitting position vacated by

Stewart is junior Kelly Matheis.
Matheis was recently selected by
her teammates as the most-
improved player on this past
year's team.

Evaluating his team's play
against the Lady Buckeyes, Col-
lier opined, ''It was disappointing

to lose to Ohio State because we - -

defeated them all three times we
played them last year.

"No question our team has
taken a couple of steps back as
far as ability and intensity. The
real issue is whethef these play-
ers plus our incoming recruits in

our program will be nationally ‘

competitive next year. I believe
we will," added Collier.

Caps try to end playbff

By Ralph Bernstein
AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA — Are the
Washington Capitals about to
complete another chapter in
their history of NHL playoff fu-
tility?

Six straight times before this
year the Capitals have been in
the playoffs, and they're in
danger of elimination for the
sixth straight time. Only twice
have they won a playoff
round, and they never ad-
vanced from divisional com-
petition.

The Capitals trail the
Philadelphia Flyers 3-1 in their
best-of-seven first-round
Patrick Division series, giving
them a tough road as they
head into game five Tuesday
night in Landover, Md.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April l2, 1988

Washington seems to find a
way to lose in the playoffs.
Twice in the last three years
the Capitals have bowed out
by losing three straight while
needing one victory to
advance.

Last year the deciding game
went to four overtime periods
before the Caps lost.

This period of frustration
might have reached a new
high Sunday, when the Caps
blew a three-goal lead with-10
minutes to play in regulation
and lost 5-4 in sudden death.

Washington coach Bryan

_ Murray said after Sunday's col-

lapse that his team didn't
panic.

’’It wasn't a panic situation,"
Murray said. ”We had pretty
good composure.”

Murray said his team missed
defensemen Scott Stevens and
Rod Langway, who didn't play
in game four because of in-
juries.

”Late in the game we really
missed Stevens and Langway.
We could have used their ex-
perience to get more pressure
on them.”

The Capitals’ past playoff
frustration hasn't gone unno-
ticed for Rick Tocchet of the
Flyers, who passed the puck to
Murray Craven for Sunday's
game—winning goal.

”Maybe they're doubting
themselves. You have to sense
that that's been the history of
their franchise. They can't
seem to win the big playoff
game. We want to stamp on
them and crush them."

wasn't really expected to be a
Top 10 selection to begin with.

But the Cardinals, not the
shrewdest of dealers when it
comes to matters on draft day,
still took him, possibly to pres-
sure Lomax, or possibly just to
have more backup security than
Stoudt provided. Whatever the
reason, the Cardinals drafted the
6-foot-3, 212-pound Stouffer, but
they didn't sign him. And they
still haven't.

The team initially offered him
$1.3 million over four years.
Stouffer refused. They increased
the package several times, but
never enough to satisfy Stouffer
or his agent, Michael Blatt.

The Cardinals most recent deal
was worth $2.4 million over four
years, or over $1 million more
than the original offer a year ago.

And Stouffer recently rejected
it.

Now one of two things must be
happening here —— either Stouffer
believes that his holdout status
will gain him even more cash in
the upcoming draft, which he
will be eligible for, or Stouffer has
somehow confused himself with
Vinny Testaverde.

Six hundred grand a year isn't
too bad a starting salary for a
young buck out of college, and
Stouffer probably realizes that.
Green Bay and the Los Angeles
Raiders, two teams that have an

early selection in this year's draft,
have expressed interest. So have
Seattle and San Diego. Those
teams, especially the Raiders,
need quarterbacks, plain and sim-
ple. But are they going to just
plop down a contract worth more
than $2.4 million to a player with
suspect NFL capability who has
been out of the game for well
over a year?

One would think not.

His stock surely hasn't risen
much over the year, and it might
have even dropped same. If he
decides to re-enter the draft this
year, he might not be selected un-
til the second or even third
round. His high contract de-
mands hard-core bargaining after
having scared some teams away.

Maybe the location of St. Louis
turned Stouffer off, or perhaps it
was the Cardinals long-standing
losing tradition. But the Cards are
now in the clean, growing area of
Phoenix, so that deterrent should
have been taken care of. So it
seems as if Stouffer just doesn’t
like the Cardinals.

But when considering the
Cardinals overpriced $2.4 million
peace offering, how could he not
but extend his right arm to them
at the negotiating table, and then
on the playing field?

Ever hear of gettin’ while the
gettin’s good? Don’t think
Stouffer knows good gettin’ when
