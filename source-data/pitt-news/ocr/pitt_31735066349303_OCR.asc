Four candidates have turned in
petitions making their candidacy
for Student Government Board
(SGB) president ofﬁcial, and 18
candidates will battle for the six
Board seats. ‘

The presiden-
tial candidates
are Larry Cha-

The Pitt News questioned each
presidential candidate on several
issues, including faculty unioniza-
tion, tuition increases and payment
for student seats at football games.

Chaban, current president of the

would employ a different approach
than the current SGB. “I wouldn't
be as low-key,” he said’. “They
were too timid.”

He proposed organizing a
student coalition that would be
larger than the Board and would
include representatives of more
student groups. “If it worked,” he
said, “it could replace the present
system.” ‘

Chaban said he would support a
faculty union that had educational
quality as a primary concern.

More pressure on the adminis-
tration to reveal level-one budgets

Chaban’s strategy to combat
higher tuition. “Until we see the
budgets, we don’t‘ know how they
spend our money,’-’ he explained.

He opposes payment for football
tickets and suggested a student
boycott of games if a payment plan
were implemented.

He supports_ a student referen-
dum to determine if student
leaders would be remunerated.

concerns were not overlooked
during faculty union proceedings.

The ﬁght last year against tuition
increases was directed against the,

wrong people, Gronsky stated. “It=-

should have been concentrated
more towards the administration,
not the state.” P ‘

If elected, he said, he would

Student Accounts and Student Aid,
and would try to eliminate the
mandatory 19-meal plan for resi-

“The best system for football
tickets is no pay,” he said. “If at
all possible, I would like to see a
no-pay system." _ ,

Mark Satinoff, currently a Board
member and head of the Young
Socialist slate, said this year's
Board did not have an effective
strategy to win the demands

The Pittsburgh “Super” Steel-

Cowboys, 10-7, going into the ﬁnal
quarter of yesterday’s Super Bowl,
added 14 points in the guise of a
safety, two ﬁeld goals and a
beautiful 64-yard touchdown pass
from Terry Bradshaw to All-Pro
wide receiver Lynn Swann, to
become only the third team to win
back-to-back Super Bowls.

as smaller class sizes,” he said.
“Students should make the
decision whether we pay for tickets
or have_ a coupon system,” he said.

“‘The SGB should ﬁght for that

right.” i . V
His strategy, “ he said, ywould
include public demonstrations,
rallies and boycotts.
Satinoff would liketo enlarge the
Board to include 30 or more
‘representatives and would like to
"see removal of SGB members made
easier, he said. .
' In his position as an SGB

' member thisyear, he has worked

on formulating the strategy for
future battles against higher
tuition. l ,
‘ Barry Weisband, a member of
the SGB Allocations Committee,
said experience would make it
easier for him to head the Board.

“The first months of the new _,

administration are spent on alloca-

tions, and it won’t take me three or .

four weeks to figure, out what I’m
doing.” _ ‘ '

He advocates student participa-
tion in the faculty union question to
guard against higher tuition or
lower educational quality, but said
the Board can’t "take a stand until
the faculty “decides its own fate.”

He would ﬁght any attempts to
charge students for football tickets
and would similarly oppose any‘
further increases in tuition. V

Grievance Procedure

Areas Recommended 3 v

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN .

The Student.Accounts Ofﬁce,

.work conditions’ for student em-

ployes and a V Housing Contract
revision are three areas that should
be dealt with in the Chancellor’s
proposal for a University-wide
grievance procedure, Student Gov-
ernment Board (SGB) President
Larry Platt ‘said in a year-end report
to the Board last week.

Platt said a ‘ well- developed
grievance procedure could serve

- the students’ immediate needs for

complaint resolution and serve as a
testing ground for evaluation of

.University business policy." '
“Students currently have no.

appeal mechanism through which
to dispute decisions ‘made by the
Office of Student Accounts regard-
ing penalty fees,” Platt explained.

Platt’s report also said the
grievance procedure could be used
to regulate the University's treat-
ment of -student workers and could
be used to settle cases ‘of alleged
unfair labor practices. T '

A grievance procedure also could
be used to interpret the-provisions

, of the housing‘ contract, Platt’s

report said. 1;, p’
The SGB feels that the current
housing contract is in need of

' r,evision.. bec'aug'se.v_it outlines the
obligatiollsp of ;the, students as _
tenants witho.u:t7 ,'provisiol_l -for

 

speciﬁc services the University will ‘  
provide as landlord, according to _

the report.’

Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s pro-
posal for the creation of a
University-wide‘ grievance proce-
dure is in accordancewith. -the

Afﬁrmative Action provisions of’ . 
Title IX of the Education Amend-~ ’

ments of 1972', which”prohibits’
sex discrimination
assisted education programs. .

The Student Aid Ofﬁce should- - 
make adjustments in aid in the‘

event of tuition increases,’ Platt
said. , . « ;
“I have written a letter to Chuck

Dees of Student Aid to see- -if they A

could make it clear that students

could challenge the dec_isions’Von_t 

their aid,”.’ he added. _ .
“The University makes‘ its

decision on aid by July 15, based on " i‘ V Y 

calculations of possible state and

federal aid.” Platt said. “There-is 
no adjustment made for tuition ’

increases unless a student speciﬁ-
cally calls for it."’ V

Platt‘ also outlined t_he.SGBf's'__' 
stand on the interest from; the  7
_Student Activities fee, reporting

that the SGB will continue ‘to

dispute the University's claim. to

standards yesterday after the
Steelers’ 21-17 Super Bowl victory.
Police made more than 200 arrests,
mostly for disorderly conduct and
drunkenness. ~

Police in riot gear spent the night

:._f«"§;gersing crowds from the down-

ea.

ro’wn area after several thousand

shivering but ecstatic fans jammed

the center-city- streets.

The singing and dancing football
fans met‘ head-on with more than
300 helmeted policemen‘ and
several dozen ,German Shepherd
dogs along Liberty Avenue, where
scattered instances of bottle-
throwing were reported. '

Most‘ of the celebrating erupted
shortly after 5 p.m. when bumper-
to-bumper traffic pushed, its way
into downtown streets that_ were
virtually empty.

The police dispatcher ordered
patrol cars to close the area to all
cars, buses, trolleys and pedes-
trians at 6 p.m., but was sharply
told he was “a little late” by the
occupants of an anonymousrpolice
car.

The’ majority of celebrants who
slipped ‘through the police lines
congregated .along Liberty Avenue
chanting “We’re Number One!
We’re Number One! ”'and drinking
alcoholic beverages to offset the
wicked cold. _

The temperature downtown had
dropped to about ﬁve degrees
above zero by mid-evening.

Celebration on the Pitt campus
was limited primarily to cheering
and toilet-paper-throwing in the
Quad and along Forbes Avenue.

~ This afternoon, an organized
parade is slated to welcome the
Steelers back from Miami. Pitts-
burgh -Mayor Pete Flaherty had

earlier asked fans to save their
exuberance for the Monday parade
“when we can all pay tribute to this

Conversion Planned j  

BY TOMMIE NELL TAYLOR

Bruce Hall, now occupied by the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA), may
be a student housing unit by April,
1978. according to Director of
Space Planning Roger Taylor.

Sandra De Bourlando, chairman
of t_h’e‘Graduate and Professional
Student Association (GPSA), said
she talked with Tom, Albert,
director of Auxiliary Services, in
November about converting Bruce
Hall to graduate housing facilities.

GSPIA probably will move to_
Forbes‘ I, the new professional
building complex behind the law
building, by the summer of 1977,

‘ Taylor said.

The cost of renovating Bruce

Hall can’t be estimated, he added, ,

because no administrative decision

has been made as towhat type of ’

housing it will become.

Since Bruce Hall.was originally A
an apartment complex. it will cost
more to convert it into dormitory ‘
apartments.

facilities than into
again. Taylor said.

De Bourlando said no housing. 

facilities exist specifically for“
graduate students, except for the

Ruskin apartments on North A

Belleﬁeld Avenue. .

‘But according to Barbara Wolf,

senior secretary of apartment
housing for graduate students,
several additional housing 'units
exist: the Forbés-Craig unit with
59 apartments, the Ruskin unit
with 176 apartments and the

Mayflower unit with 19 apart,-.

ments.

De Bourlando said the estimated R

15,000 graduate students would

welcome the Bruce Hall housing '4
facility because “the accommoda-v

tions we often ﬁnd are overpriced,
dirty, isolated and inconvenient.”_

   Our SGB Endorsements

Voting in an election is seldom easy. business when a voter intends
seriously to examine the candidates on their past performances, their
‘stands on the crucial issues and the programs they plan to implement

in office. _

What it more difficult rightnow is a long slate of contenders
the voters must consider. They year ﬁnds four candidates running for
Student Government (SGB) president and 18 vying for seats on the

Board. '

While the candidates have their hands full trying to show why one is
better than the other, the voters are likewise having scarcely an easy
time narrowing their choices to one presidential contender and four

selections for the six-seat Board. -

\

The Pitt News, after interviewing every official candidate, urges-
undergraduate students to vote for the following candidates:

SGB President—Jie Gronsky

."SGBMembers-+Stefﬁ Brooks, Lan'yKrain, Larry

BenitaMamcus'

Gleason and

For the office of president, Joe Gronsky has the necessary

.2 combination of enthusiasm and sound planning to place him
‘ sufﬁciently above his nearest competitor.

 has pledged utilization of other student leaders (Greeks,
engineers, etc.) to form a broader. power base from which to operate.

‘ .. We are particularly interested in Gronsky’s willingness" to confront the

faculty unionization issue head-on, maneuvering among the various
union factions to the students’ best advantage.
For the Board, we feel that Larry Krain brings the necessary

, imaginﬁion and experience needed to act on the important issues
' facing Pitt students in the coming year. Having worked on several

Student Government committees, Krain has a feeling for management
and negotiation with both students and administrators.

V Steﬁi Brooks would provide the necessary‘ social consciousness that
unfortunately is too often missing from the SGB. The past year showed
us the value of having a Board member who isﬁrmly committed to the

7 struggle against racism and sexism.

M Iarry Gleason and Benita Marcus also should be elected to the board
 ~;=for their well-thought-out plans and“ frank evaluations of thecurrent
University situation. Few contenders for the Board showed such a

_ grasp of the issues and the way to approach them.

For further clariﬁcation, we urge students to attend the “Meet the

Lounge.

 Candidates’ Day” scheduled for Tuesday in the Student Union Lower

Confronting them with the main issues—-faculty unionization, tuition

_hikes and program cuts, athletic tickets,‘ activities fee interest-will

providea vantage point from which the serious contenders will be seen

apart from the also-rans.

A-few minutes with the candidates will make the voting a lot easier.

I H.

The Resident Student Associa-
tion (RSA) would like to extend our
apologies to all students who
attended the 27-foot-screen show-
ing of the Super Bowl. Due to a
unit that burned out, it was

-necessary to keep’ people outside
the doors until the problem was
resolved. This step was taken to
protect the equipment since there
was a possibility that the game may

service to the students, which was
why there was no charge to the
students for the game. The RSA
would like to extend its apologies to
all people who- attended for the
inconveniences that were caused
by our problems. '

  Concerning Logos and Dodos

BY J OHNMETCALFE

A couple of "months ago, a reader sent a letter to
this newspaper asking why the front page still
displayed the outdated device of a candle within a
shield to symbolize the University. I was horriﬁed.
The older design had been a part of my life since the

period known as my Early Middle Youth. Under the ~

candle, it said “VERITAS ET VIRTUS,” which
seemed noble whether you could read it or not. The
name of the place (UNIVERSITY of PITTSBURGH)
was sometimes included. Always, there was mention
of the cryptic date, ‘‘I787.'’

-The shield itself was divided by lines radiating
from the flame of the candle, like light rays. Three of
the lines were extra thick, suggesting the three rivers

. we- keep downtown.

-This was a ﬁne coat of arms, suitable for use on
letterheads and the like. It did not even require that
one be an alumnum (this is a neuter -form—'my Latin

. is thatgood) of the institution in order to recognize it.

The reader. inquired whether The Pitt News was
unaware that a new “logo” had been devised for the
University, and that everyone else was using it. No
wonder I looked worried. I had thought this was the
case, and that if the staff were ever reminded of this

__ oversight, said oversight would be corrected straight

out of existence. It was a trying time.

The gallantstaff replied in boldface just below the
inquiring letter that there was no mistake here, and
that devotion to_Truth and Virtue might be doubly
important to a newspaper that had to live within a
University that had abandoned both——at least in its
logo. I agree.

The whole thing is silly and expensive. The very
people who concocted this new monstrosity have
issued ﬁgures documenting the enormous expense.of
such a change; it is smaller than, but similar to, the
hullaballoo that accompanied the drastic change from
“ESSO". to “EXXON." That_one,was said by its

proprietors to have cost’ $100 million. It’ ,
accomplished, nothing. '

We still know that “EXXON” is “ESSO."' The

But I was talking about the new University logo. I
hope it does not appear on the front of this issue of
thisgpaper. It is monstrous. It is worse than the old
one.

The new logo resembles an Interstate Highway
marker that has not yet been granted a
numb'er—perhaps it does not go anywhere. The
center is dominated by a sort of checkerboard. It
could be used only by the most» primitive,- sort of
players. It presents a full set of ranks, but has only
two files; nobody will ever win at this; having

jumped, there is no place to land.

make it look like an Interstate Highway sign that has,

The new logo is not really much sillier than the old
one. but the old cartoon of a candle at least had_

' gotten itself recognizable. .It will be a. long time.

Recently, the NBC television networkauthorized
the replacement for its peacock. It cost nearly $1
million, but a replacement was found. Just before
this newornament to our lives (a stylized letter “N")
was unveiled, NEBC learned that some poor soul in
far-off Nebraska had furnished the same logo to his
local educational station for $100. There is'a lesson

r here.

Defenders of Pitt’s new logo claim it resembles the
coat ofarms of William Pitt. That it does. but it is the .
coat of arms he adopted after he became Earl of
Chatham.

reply to this article I would like to
set a few things straight. '

The author seems to have missed ~
the major point ‘ of the band's

advcrtiscment._lt was partially to
get the crowd to open its eyes at
halftime. but as the large print at
the bottom of the page read,‘ it was
primarily to spread
enthusiasm and spirit the band
possesses to the rest of the crowd.

I don't intend to call the author
ignorant since he had the .decency

to sign his namc}. but I must call-

him insolcnt for speaking out. on a
‘subject he obviously knows nothing
about. I was convinced of this by
M.E. Elbas‘ comments regarding
the West Virginia band. ‘

It was mentioned in the article
how impressive West Virginia's
new band uniforms looked. If Elbas
had even so much asnoticed the
Pit! band once this yczii'. he would

"good," Mr. Elbas.

That brings us to the issue that
has been ,"skirtcd" for so long.
Why doesn't Pitt have a large

SGB Roundup

BY BILL MOORE

_Editor’s Note: All 18 of this
year’s Student Government Board
[SGB] candidates were interviewed
this weekend by The Pitt News.

They were asked to respond to
many issues, including faculty
unionization, tuition hikes and
payment for football tickets. They
also were asked to list their ideas
on what new issues the SGB should
look into, and what old ones should
be revived.

Following, in alphabetical order,
are A capsule summaries of’ the
candidates’ views:



GARY ARCURI

Arcuri considers "himself repres-
entative of a large majority of the
student body. “Like 99% of all
students,” he said, ‘.‘I really don’t
know that much about Student
Government.” _

Arcuri disagrees, with the pres-
ent Board’s handling of problems
and called for more student
involvement in SGB affairs.

He opposes student paymentfor
football games, and claimed his
‘being on the Pitt football team
would allow him to do “a hell of a
lot" in that area.

On faculty unionization, Arcuri ‘

said the Board definitely should be
fjnvolved, but said the stand taken
T by the Board would depend on
student opinion.
‘He also said he would like to see
a strengthening of the hockey
program at Pitt. A
On lack of student involvement,
he said, “A strong body is one that

exercises. If students exercise
\ ’ "-1

their right to vote, we’ll have a
strong student body."

NICK DROBAC

Drobac advocated Student Gov-
ernment involvement in securing

’ more scholarship money on the

federal, state and University levels.

He supports faculty unionization. I
“It is good,” he said, “because
faculty wages will be increased and
that will attract better teachers.”

To fight tuition hikes, Drobac
said he would organize student
marches and letter-writing cam-
paigns on all levels.

He would not fight the manda-
tory 19-meal plan for resident

‘freshmen, he said, because “they

have to make a buck. There is no
way the cafeteria could operate
without it.”

He transferred to Pitt last term
from a community college, but said
he was active in student govern-
ment there and was a member, of
the Pennsylvania Student Lobby.

LARRY GLEASON

Gleason called for better com-
munication between Student Gov-
ernment and students, claiming the
present Board could not implement
its goals because it lacked support.

A coalition'_ of student organiza-
tion, he suggested, could increase
the effectiveness of the Board.
“There has to be a complete,
uniﬁed student body to back you
up,” Gleason said.

He stressed the importance of
the facult unionization issue to
students, ut said he could take no
stand until he took a closer look at
the facts. A

    

GARY ACURI

He said he would insist on
student involvement in the faculty
union proceedings.

He opposes tuition hikes and

payment for football tickets, but
said he would consider a comprom-
ise if the money were returned to
the Student Activities Fee fund or
used to support~student programs.

He said tuition has to be held to a
minimum.

JO ANN HALLER -

g “I wouldn’t be as antagonistic as
last year’s Board,” Haller said.
“They accused the administration
of things before they. knew the
facts." - I

She said she would oppose

’ unionization of faculty if it meant

an increase in tuition or decrease in
educational quality, but was not yet
sure whether it would.

  

  

STEFFI BROOKS
She said a student boycott of '

football games could be an
effective way of battling any
attempt to require'students to pay
for tickets.

She termed last year’s efforts to

stop the tuition hike “a big flop.”~ '
’ She proposed involvement with

other state schools and said she
would push to see the level-one

budget. ‘‘I don't see why it isn’t

possible, and we might have to talk
with some lawyers,” she said. i ,

Haller advocated mandatory
listing by faculty of the--number of
tests, papers'and required books in

, the course descriptions issued at

registration time.

JOE HOWARD
Howard was anxious to have the
University provide a 24-hour study
facility. “There is nowhere to go

looking for possible ‘cuts in

“The more involved students can I
get in running the University, the
more responsive the University will

be to students,” he said.-

. He criticized the administration
“shoving the ticket-coupon

“The best thing the Board can do
on faculty unionization,” Hubbard

BENIT A. MARCUS
Marcus said she would like to
see the University renovate a house

to spend the night on campus. -
“If the faculty does unionize,”
she said, “there would have to be a
‘no-strike‘ clau‘se in the contract.
We are paying for our education,
and it wouldn’t be fair if there were
a strike.”-

She proposed a massive lobbying
effort by student groups to stop
attempts to initiate a charge for
student football tickets. “There is

organize a voter registration drive

pressure in Harrisburg.
CLIFF PROTZMAN
Protzman sees a lack of
openness in the present SGB, and
said" he would try to change‘ it if
elected. ‘ ‘

He wasuncommittted on faculty

unionization: “We should examine

‘ it to ﬁnd out how it will affect

students," he said.
“Students definitely don't want

' to pay for football tickets,” he said,

“and we should try to find ways to
avoid it."

" 'He wants to‘ look further into

student aid, and the housing
contract, and advocates “strong-
er” methods to ﬁght tuition hikes.
He also said’ he would work to
have the Activities Fee interest
deposited in a student fund.
Protzman said he would publi-
cize his office hours to increase
SGB‘s openness to students.

“I wish the present Board had

Scalamogna said. .

“The ultimate burden from
faculty unionization will rest on the

students," he said. .“I would like-

universities where there has been
. unionization. ” ,

He called for a change in the
funding priorities of the SGB
Allocations Committee _and a closer
look at groups that are highly
funded. , \

He opposes tuition hikes and
payment for football tickets unless
the administration could prove it is
necessary. “A tuition hike would

a business proposition and a

The three seek their fortune
through the highly profitable
business of rum running, running
also into a syndicate trying to drive
the independents out of business.

Minnelli is still playing the same
madcap poor girl she’s been doing
since Cabaret, and it’s appropriate
enough here. Nobody expects
much, anyway. Reynolds is solidly
in his element as a light comic hero
(he just can’t -handle the heavy
stuff), especially as a not-too-bright
stud. Hackman is puzzling. He
starts off as a gritty grifter, and
magically turns into ’ a suave
leading man when he puts on a new
hat. He doesn’t take the part-too
seriously, which accounts for a
sometimes uneven performance.

One_ problem with Lucky Lady
(and indeed with so many modern
so-called comedies) is its insistence
in making the villains—from Coast
Guard patrols to competing gang-
sters—into buffoons.

you have to be able to at least
tolerate Peckinpah’s cynicism, self
pity, macho and, generally gray
outlook on life. His \ﬁlmS, if one
can get into them, ‘have the
questionable effect of making the
viewer hate just about everything
in the world. .

The Killer Elite concerns a
fictitious private company that
subcontracts killing assignments
principally from the CIA. Lovely.
Peckinpah cutely points out at the
film's beginning that no organiza-
tion like this could exist in the
United States.

Okay. James Caan is one of the
company's leading hit men, a
skilled.killer who does his job

\expertly and who doesn’t have

anything going for himself after
that. He’s maimed by a man
(Robert Duvall) whom he considers
his best friend, and spends much of
the movie rehabilitating. This is
where the core of the movie is—in
Caan’s struggle to overcome his
imposed weakness and return to
his full self. ' -

Needless to say, he’s shrugged
off by. his superior, a bland

and the boss (Gig Young), but he

interrupts, and Caan is called in to
combat his nemesis and ‘protect

(rather than assassinate) a Chinese .

diplomat passing through the
United States. But Duvall has been
assigned (by his side) to kill the
diplomat. .

There are ‘several ways to
approach The Killer ‘Elite. If

Peckinpah turns you off, then,,.

obviously, The Killer Elite will turn
you off. The preoccupation" with
violence, or even just the little

things that make one squeam‘ish~

(like removing the stitches from
Caan’s many scars), and the

insistence on a very cynical view

that sees men and women alike as

 

just competing whores, are not the -

things that bring in the mass
audiences.

For the “action lover” who dines. 

on a steady diet of fabricated gore,
The Killer Elite may be a little
tame. That’s right.

The Killer Elite is not really an
action movie about hardened
killers. It’s a jaundiced look at a
rather seamy side of existence-
seen as though it were the only side
of life—where men aren’t heroes,
but just more skillful than others at

- staying alive. '

Onstage, Deep Purple has

bands in the heavy metal field.’ It

Friday evening, Deep Purple Phase

Purple opened with “Burn,” and .

the arena buzzed with approval. It
seemed as if Purple was on its way
to tearing the'\place up, as it did in
all its previous Pittsburgh appear-
ances. But it wasn't long before
the problems began. ‘

Their small businesses became big
businesses.

Why? Because they ﬁlled a need.
They did the job.-People liked the
way they did business, and their
businesses grew.

Such growth, a logical and even
necessary phenomenon in the
private-enterprise system, seems gore-
ly misunderstood today. “A grow-
ing volume of criticism equates big-
ness with badness,” says Randall
Meyer, president of Exxon Co.
U.S.A. “Big business” is -‘portrayed
as a monster born full-grown, deter-
mined to snuff out little competitors
-and run roughshod over consumers.

Neither the historical record nor
the economic and social realities of
America today support such a view.
Big business has not “cornered” the
U.S.-marketplace and work force.

‘businesses with one to three em-

ployes.. The “big” businesses employ I

15.6 million workers out of a total
I work force of 86.6 million. if

Nor-"has big business ‘cornered the -

nation's wealth.‘ The approximately

A 5 percentof American wealth (prop-
erty, plant and equipment, and

inventories) held by U.S. manufac- '

turing corporations with assets of

$1 billion or more is slightly less-

than -those companies had a decade
ago.’ ‘

Fears of big business often stem
from lack of understanding of the

V basic economic reasons why some

businesses grow big and others stay
small. Big jobs, like the produc-
tion of steel, chemicals or great
quantities of such complex products
as automobiles or television sets, re-

quire huge investments of capital, ‘

raw materials and managerial and
technical skills. Indeed, looking to
the world problems of energy, natu-

ral resources and the environment, .

one must conclude, as has noted his-
torian C. N,orthcoteParkinson, that
big business must grow bigger be-
cause “the research that underlies
the discoveries, whether geophysical
in -Alaska, or chemical in West Ger-

many, demands a scale of invest—‘

ment that is beyond the reach of the
family ﬁrm.”

But sometimes even relatively
simple products, like razor blades or
chocolate bars, require “bigness” be-
cause of the enormous markets that

exist for them. Then, too, we'are

living in an age when the efﬁ—
ciency of bigness, the “economy of
scale” as it is called, is vital if-com-
panics -are to remain competitive.
This is especially true where‘the
‘competition consists of huge foreign
combines backed heavily by their
governments’ treasuries. General
Motors may account for 43 percent
of U.S. auto sales, but it has only

mous research and development re-
quired to compete in such markets
is simply beyond the means of small
companies.

On the. other hand, there are in-
numerable ta§ks—the sale of con-
sumer goods and services, home and
automobile repairs, restaurants, to
name a few—that'can be handled

. efﬁciently by both small and large

businesses in a local area.

‘It . is important to realize that —

businessesbig and little carry out
their tasks in a vital atmosphere of
interdependence. Small businesses,
for example, would be much less
prosperous withoutithe tools, raw
materials, ﬁnished and semi-ﬁnished
products they purchase from big
ﬁrms. As Leo McDonough, execu-
tive vice president of the Smaller
Manufacturers Council (comprising
575 companies), says, “If there
weren’t a U.S. Steel or a Jones 8:
Laughlin spitting out fantastic
amounts of steel and keeping prices

But what about competition?
Aren’t the big boys stamping it out

There are ‘many energetic, clever

makes a similar product—because
we can build it at a lower price and
give faster delivery.” "
Remarks Irvine Robbins, of giant
Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co.:
“Sometimes when we get big, we
get a little lazy, a little complacent.”
When his company grew big by con-
centrating on “walk-in, walk-out”
ice—cream stores, F arrell’s' of Port-
land, Ore., moved proﬁtably into
the same market as BR with sit-
down soda—fountain-parlors. “They

. was that we improved a little, and

Farrell’s is doing ﬁne, too.” .. -
‘ As to the charge that ‘big business

artiﬁcially keeps prices high, the facts ’

again rip apart the rhetoric. A study
by economist J. Fred ~Weston, of the
University of California, Los An-

geles, reveals that the heavily con- »
centrated industries (big. business) -

have held prices down better than
smaller and less concentrated ones.
In industries where the top‘ four
companies had at least 75 percent of
the business, prices rose an average
of 47 percent during the inﬂationary
period 1967-1975. But_in the least-

concentrated sectors . of industry,

prices rose 70 percent in the same
period. Leonard Woodcock, presi-

dent of the United Auto Workers, ’

admits: “The old anti-trust notion

—that, if you break things up into ‘

small competitive units, you will

have lower competitive ‘prices —- may - \

be wrong. General Motors, the big-

gest car producer, is without ques-

tion the most efficient and most

able to hold down thecost of its

products.” .
Whatever their size, in the end,

. businesses in Americamust pass the

test imposed by the most aﬂluent
and sophisticated consumers in the
world. Any businessmust aH'irma-
tively answer those old questions:

It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times, for the die-hard,
tough-luck Panthers. It seemed,
for one brief, shining moment, that
Pitt was about to work a basketball
modern-day miracle. It was not to
be, though—the Panthers lost, to

powerful Marquette, 73-62, before,

a packed house in the Milwaukee
Arena on Saturday.

After trailing by _20 points at the
halfway mark of the ﬁrst period,
and by 14, 39-25, at intermission,
the scrappy Panther amoeba
defense took the Warriors to task. in

the second stanza, and the offense .

began clicking. Pitt drew to within
four points of the second-ranked

team in the-country with over ‘four,

minutes left in the contest.
They did indeed score a moral

victory when the mighty, yea, the

unbeatable -Warriors went into a-

stall offense for almost two minutes
before getting a back-door layup by
Butch Lee at 2:10. .
Characteristically, the Panthers
would throw the ball away, commit
an offensive foul, etc. But this was
no ordinary Panther performance.
Bob Shrewsbury hit the open shot,
cutting the lead back to four, 62-58.
Again the Warriors refused the
upset bid. All-America candidate
Earl Tatum hit both ends of his visit
to the charity stripe. The Panthers
came right back with time running

1 out when Larry Harris hit on a

jumper. The Panthers refused to
fold.

Tatum again hit for the Warriors,
and this time his shot was
answered by a bucket from
freshman Wayne Williams.

So the four-point contest came
down to the last minute. The
Panthefs had" to foul in an attempt

_ to get their hot hands on the ball

again. They never got the
chance—the Warrior big men
grabbed crucial missed foul shots
and turned them into buckets of
rain for the Cats.

In the last 40 seconds of the
contest, Marquette scored the ﬁnal
seven points, turning the ﬁnal
score into a mockery of the best
Panther performance to date ‘this

season, - .-

The ﬁrst half ofthe game went as
expected. as Marquette scored the
first 13 points before Willie Kelly,
who played an exceptional game at
center against the likes of 6-10-
Dennis Whitehead and 6-9 forward
Bo Ellis,—tapped in a Harris misﬁre
to make the score 13-2.

The rest of the ﬁrst half was
played fairly even. Marquette
gained a 20-point advantage, and
the Panthers closed to within 11
from time to time.

One illusion was blatantly
evident in that first period. The
Warriors were giving the Panthers
justtone shot at the basket.

It was a make-or-break it
situation, and the Panthers proved
themselves worthy. Not only did
they refuse to be blown away, but
they let the big boys from
Wisconsin know they were in for
the battle of their lives. I

Marquette is an excellent bas-
ketball team, mostdeserving of its
No. ‘2 national ranking and .its 11-1
record.

But how can a team, crippled by
injuries to the likes of Keith Starr,
Tom Richards and Ralph _Mc-
Clelland, playing their hearts out,

  Gymnastsﬂurting - Split   9

BY PATT,Y‘TASCAREI.LAf

The Pitt gymnastics teams’
opened the season Friday night
against West Virginia; the women

edged out the Mountaineers by a .6 .

‘margin, and the men took a 7.6
loss. » ‘‘
Both coaches cited injuries as
the major problem. Pantherette‘
Coach Donna DeMarino was
missing a. large section of her
team—ﬁve girls sat out with
injuries. Men’s Coach Ig Perez is
starting with a squad devastated by

mishaps; of his three all-around '
‘ players, Gus Papantonio is out for
the season, and while team captain .

Don Stevenson and Rob Pasterick
competed’ in the opener, both’
played injured.

“Rob shouldn’t have competed
Fridaynight,” Perez said. “We
put a lot of weight on his shoulders.
We shouldn’t have, but everyone
else was injured. If I’d known we
were going to lose, I wouldn't have
let him compete.” .

DeMarino, fortunately, has .- the
services of Cyndee Severyn, who
placed ﬁrst in the balance beam
and ﬂoor competitions and fresh-
man Dianne Miller, who took ﬁrst
in the vault: Also, unlike Perez,
whose original ‘team was primarily
juniors, DeMarino has a young
team—eight of the 14 members are
freshmen. '_ .

, “West Virginia had a lot more
difﬁculty in a couple of events than
we did,” she observed. “We had a
lot more class, and our routines
were a lot cleaner and a lot more
polished. That’s an important
thing in gymnastics; it's not just
being able to do the skill but to do it
well. "

“Miller has a terriﬁc vault.

‘We're looking for,her to pick up on‘
the bars, also. And Claire Henry

  'l‘rackstersBegin Season   

Schurele and Kevin Carpenter
rocketed off the blocks with a‘ 6.3
and a 6.4 and ﬁnished one-two,
respectively, in the high hurdles.
Tom [Herman (2:14.4), Nick
Martin (2:16.4), John Bieranpwski
(2:17) and Mark Studnicki (2:19)
were the top four finishers in the
‘l,000-meters. Studnicki also
placed fourth in the mile run.
Alex Kasich, WVU’s cross-
country All-american, won a

(another member of the active-but-
injured list), when she’s able, /is
probably one of thebest vaulters in
the_East,” DeMarino added, V

For Perez, the future is not so
bright with thecore of his team
riddled by injuries.

“When we started three years
ago, we had one senior, two juniors
and the rest freshmen,” Perez
explained. “And those freshmen
were all-around, which you rarely
see‘in any school. We had the
highest increase in score of any
team in the country. It"s kind of
discouraging, but we've just got to
face the facts—we’ve got freshmen
again.” I

“But I’ll tell you, I was really
proud of them at WVU. I forgot
they were freshmen—I really don’t
think of them that way.”

One of the biggest hopes for the
Panthers is sophomore Frank
Klein. vHe arrived ‘last yearlwith
the disadvantage of never having
performed with a gymnastics team,
but his natural talents, combined
with added maturity, make him an
integral part of the team.‘.

Pitt gymnastics is unique be-

cause of the close relations
between the men's and women’s
teams. _
Gymnastics also has an unusual
position in the world of sports; it is
‘individually oriented, not only in

5 riting performancesbut also in the

rewards received. For the aspiring

gymnast, there are no hopes of a ‘

professional career other than
center ring at Ringling Brothers,
Barnum and Bailey. And with the
time the Pitt teams devote to
studies, the dreams of an Olympic
medal are also ruled out.

“The think I try to stress the
most ’ is to strive for personal
satisfaction,” DeMarino said.
“Because if a girl sets her; goals
high and I encourage her to satisfy
herself, then she might be able to
sneak out of the gym a little early
and fool me, but she can’t get away
from herself and ultimately, she

. has to answer to herself.

“When they ask me ‘Should I do 
it again; do I have to do another‘

routine?’ I ask them if they’re
satisﬁed.”

Satisfaction is the key to Pitt
gymnastics-

  Panmerettes Win Again  

BY PATIYTASCARELLA - ,

The Pantherette basketball team
won its third straight game when it
avalanched West Virginia Univer-
sity, 73-41 , . Saturday night.

The celebrated Pitt-defense was
unbelievably formidable in the ﬁrst
half, keeping the Mountaineers ‘
almost completely away from the
scoreboard. With 8:15 remaining
in the half, the Pantherettes, led by",
hot-handed Diane Zaken, lunged
off to a 18-2 lead. ;

WVU tried to penetrate the Pitt
defense with the oldest hallmark of
Mountaineer teams—total "aggres-
sion—but to no avail. WVU guard
“Sam” Booth (5-6) picked up four '
quick fouls in less than two
minutes. But Pitt led, 32-8, at the
half.

If WVU had played throughout
the entire game as it did in the
second half, -it could've’ proven a

‘contest to rival the Pantherettes’

battlefwith Ohio States last week.
Instead, Pitt’s early lead put the
game too far out of the Mountain-

‘eers’ reach for any real threat to.‘

-de_fens_e..”‘ .; _-

Theasecond ‘half consisted of
much sloppier playing from the
Pantherettes. whose concept of

defense shifted from shutting out ‘

WVU to increasing fouling.

Five-foot-eight forward Joan
Maser took charge, of the Pitt
offense to lead all scorers with 14
points. rZa’ke_n poured in 10, and
Jan Conway contributed seven.
Conway, a 5-6 guard, continued to
show increasing poise on court and
is developing into one of the best
passers on the team.

- -WVU had the edge off the boards
and totaled 56‘ rebounds to Pitt’s,
52. Kathy Szramowski brought
down ‘nine rebounds; Mimi Sen-
kowski and Maser each hauled in
SIX. .
“We have to go to the boards
more,” Pantherette Coach Pm
Wallace said. “We had a couple of
new people starting and I thought
‘we all did a good job, although we
were pulling it a little close towards
the end. .

“West Virginia likes to run. I

  rlyer Marksmen rap Soviets        “g°s“"°"a°" mt F°°t--fir:

BY STEVE SYBERT

With the recent series be-
tween National Hockey League
teams and the Soviets now history
it is safe to admit the Russians are
good. But are they better than the
North Americans? I

The Soviets sent-their top two
teams from last season against the
NHL's top eight and escaped with a
5-2-1 total mark, though they were
not able to defeat our top three
teams.

The climax of the much
publicized series came last Sunday
when the Central Red Army team,
Russia's champion, _ took on the

:;Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia

Flyers in what many considered a

, contest for the true world cham-

pionship.

Philadelphia came out on top,
4-1., in a game marred by an
unusual occurrence. With 8239 left
in the opening period, the Soviets,
after arguing fora penalty when-
Flyer defenseman Ed Van Impe
upended Army star Valery Kharla- ,
mov, packed up and left in an
action whichwill no doubt be
regarded as a famous event in
hockey history. .

All progress made with the two
Team Canada series of 1972 and
1974 could have been washed out if
not for "some tense locker room

{negotiating which brought the
- Soviets back to the ice nearly 20

minutes later. Thevother Russian
team, the Soviet Wings, pulled the
same stunt last year while playing
New Haven _on_ an American
Hockey League. tour.‘ '

Several reasons weregiven for
the Soviets’ departure. An estimat-
ed 250 million people throughout
North America, Europe and Russia
viewed the game and the Soviets
did not want their countrymen (an
estimated 100 million) seeing such
“dirty” tactics by the Flyers
against Soviet players. _

their players to get maimed for the
upcoming Olympic competition
in February—a ﬁasco which the
Russians will undoubtedly domi-
hate.

The third reason was the
appearance of several anti-Soviet
signs throughout the Spectrum.
Once again, the Soviets felt their
people should not be subjected to
such distasteful propaganda. One
sign, which ﬂashed any time the
Soviets argued,'read “TELL IT TO
THE CZAR.” '

When told the Soviets might-
have to forfeit their pay «for the
game by leaving, they came back-
quicker than the time it takes to
pronounce most of their names.e
Upon returning, the Soviets faced a.
delay-of-game penalty slapped on
them by referee Lloyd Gilmore.

‘game resumed, Reggie Leach took
a pass from Bill Barber and slid the
puck by Soviet goaltender Vladislav
Tretiak to give the Flyers a lead
they-never relinquished; Rick
MacLeish eluded. Tretiak on a
breakaway six minutes later for a
2-0 lead. _

Joe Watson extended the Flyers’
lead with a shorthanded goal -in the
second period, but Victor Kutyer-
gin made i 3-1 by beating
Philadelphia oalie Wayne Ste-
phenson to his glove side from 40
feet. Larry Goodenough scored
from the slot with 15:59 remaining

Pitt lost the mile relay by only
