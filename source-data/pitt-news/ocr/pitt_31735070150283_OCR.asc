STUDENT GOVERNMENT.
Social media takes on crucial role in
Student Government Board elections

Natalie Daher
For The Pitt News

Social media in Student Govern-
ment Board campaigning has be-
come a matter of keeping up with
thejoneses.

At midnight on Oct. 24, Twit-
ter was buzzing and Facebook was

bursting with pages for SGB candi-

dates who activated their accounts
at the earliest moment possible.
In the following weeks of the cam-
paigning that culminates in today’s
SGB elections, these sites would es-
sentially serve as online bulletin
boards where candidates could post
platforms, photographs, events and
various other information for stu-
dents to View at their leisure. _

As in the national presidential
election, the use of social media
has become critical to obtaining
votes in smaller-scale, campus-wide
elections. It is especially necessary
because of the younger audience the
election targets.

Sowmya Sanapala, an SGB can-
didate for Board running on the
Stone slate, does not believe that
candidates could have a shot at
winning the election without so-
cial media. ‘

“It is one of the main modes of
communication at this point in all
of our lives,” Sanapala said. “Social
media is how we keep in touch with
each other and is incredibly impor-
tant for this election.” .

Independent candidate Lauren
Barney saw the success that Presi-
dent Barack Obama gained from
the “Internet Election” of 2008,
and she has attempted to follow
suit. Barney has created a Facebook
page, group and event.

I “From the Democratic primaries
of 2007 and 2008, I noticed the way

 
   
    
 
      
 

that Obama pulled ahead of some-
one who was very established, like
Hillary Clinton, was through the
social media,” Barney said. “I saw
the power it has. If they can get their
name out there, this is more votes.”

Candidates themselves are not
the only ones who are in on the
Internet action. Many friends and
supporters of slates —— groups of
two or more SGB candidates run-
ning together —I take initiative
by changing their proﬁle pictures
to photographs of their preferred
candidates’ smiling faces.

“We’ve had a lot of our support-
ers change their Facebook pages,”
said current Board member and
presidential candidate Natalie
Rothenberger. “We’ve just been hav-
ing our friends reach their friends
reach their friends in a network sys-
tem to make sure that we’re reach-
ing as many students as possible.”

Although Twitter has recently

been increasing in popularity in”

comparison to previous years, Face-
book still seems to be the forerun-
ner of the social media enterprise.

Former SGB Board member Nila
Devanath said that Twitter was not
a component of her 2010 campaign
but that times have changed only
two years later.

“When I ran, Twitter was not a
very big thing. It was generally for
people just out of college or busi-
nesses,” Devanath. said. “Now,
Twitter is backpedaling. People
in college are just tweeting about
random stuff.”

Although current candidates

utilize Twitter, they have agreed’

that Facebook remains their pri-
mary form of communication. _

Despite therise of social me-
dia, Barney emphasizes the value
of face-to—face campaigning.

“I think it’s more important
to speak to people,” she said. “Al-
though [Facebook] is a great outlet
for the distribution of ideas, it’s just
not as great as going out there and
actually showing students that they
are more than just a vote. By show-
ing them that they are a person, that
shows more than just asking them
to like your Facebook page.”

The addition of the online realm
to the campaigning process has
changed the entire dynamic of the
election, according to former SGB
president Molly Stieber.

“You should never base your
campaign off of what other people
are doing, but I don’t think that
holds true when it comes to social
media,” Stieber said. “If someone
has a Facebook page, you should
make one too. It doesn’t take a
whole lot of effort, but itlcan reach
a lot of people. You’re deﬁnitely at
a disadvantage ifsomeone is able to
reach out to that many, but you’re
not.” .

The wide use of social media
outlets has the potential to increase
student voter participation from
its hardly representative percent-
ages. Although last year’s student
body turnout peaked at 24 percent,
it was a 5 percent increase from the
previous election. M

“You’ll see that the trend for
elections in turnout has gone con-

tinuously up,” said Annie Brown,

the chair of SGB’s Elections Com-
mittee. “There would be far less
turnout and less people informed
about it [without social media] just
because it’s so simple to get on a
laptop, which most people are al-
ready on.”

Many candidates have utilized

STUDENT GOVERNMENT  
SGB initiatives often a

blast from the past

Megan Trimble
Staﬁ Writer

Student GovemmentBoard promises I

of academic grace periods, faster In-
ternet and Pitt shuttles to the airport
might have students thinking they’re
experiencing deja vu. After all, SGB
candidates have made these promises
before — but according to the candi-
dates, the initiatives remain feasible.

SGB candidates run on platforms

of three initiatives that they plan to
accomplish’ over a one—year term.
The projects chosen have often been
attempted before, and many remain
unaccomplished.

For the candidates running for

‘ next year’s Board in today’s SGB elec-

tion, however, it’s no secret that their
plans are unoriginal.

INITIATIVES

SGB initiatives,” said Michael Nites,

currentAllocations Committee chair— -

man and Board member candidate
on the Steel slate. “Look at any of the
initiatives being run on, and I can
guarantee that someone has run on
it in the pas 3’

Nites is running on an initiative
for pre-ﬁnals-week academic grace
periods, orafew days off for students
before ﬁnals, an initiative that last year
madeup part of the campaign plat-
form of current Board member Zoe
Samudzi.

Samudzi said that she met resis-
tance between student and faculty
opinioninregard to which days could
be cutfrom the academic calendar. But
she said she believes thatthe projectis
still feasibleforlong—term change and

that students continuing to press the .

issue show optimism.

“There is alittle wiggle room inthe
calendar,” Samudzi said. “We laid the
foundation, and the administration

was receptive and sympathetic with
the problems that students felt a lack
of reading days was creating.”

Nites said he is not running on
an entire week of days off and that

iSamudzi“laidthe groundwork”forhis

ﬁiture progress. He did acknowledge,
however, that one year is not a lot of
time to enact change on campus, but
he feels that the academic grace period
initiative could be accomplished if the
Board “jumps on it and is proactive.”
“Projects evolve over time, and
you always need a student to advo-
cate for issues that the student body
cares about,” he said. “But it’s about
phrasing. Theres adifference between
accomplishing something and advo-
cating for it, and that is an important
distinction.” N ites said that “some—

times SGB sounds like awhine-fest” as

it names campus problems that should
be ﬁxed. He added that Board mem-
bers needto havea mixture ofprojects

they can accomplish themselves and .

others they advocate for in order to
create a blend of positive change and
to build groundwork.

Students might ﬁnd academic

grace periods tempting, but easier
and more efficient transportation is
also promised frequently.

Board member candidate David 

Rosenthal, part of the Pitt United slate,

is running on an initiative that is de— i

signed to counteract Port Authority
bus route cuts by providing students

’ transportation to the Pittsburgh In-

ternational Airport during breaks.
According to Rosenthal, this project
is certainly feasible and something
that can be accomplished during a
one-year term. .
“There was a huge student govem—
ment push last Board with [former
SGB President] Molly Stieber and the

I Port Authority cuts,” he said. “If the

28X is cut, students still need to get
to the airport, so change would need
to happen.” ' '
Rosenthal said that he spoke with
current SGB Transportation and
Safety Committee Chairman Richard
White, who Rosenthal said “seems to
feel that it was feasible as well and
could be accomplished.” Referencing
a time that he waited on Fifth Avenue
for two and a halfhours for a bus to

  

   

the airport, Rosenthal said that even if
platforms aren’t accomplished in one
year, they are still valuable.

“What you will see is that if the
administration sees [the initiative is]

apressingissueforstudents,thenthey [

will take note of the problem and will
be more likely to work with studen ,”
he said. '

Faster Internet is also a common
theme among candidate platforms.
Various campaign platforms incorpo-

rate an Internet improvement initi_a- _

tive this campaigning season, from
the Fifth slate’s]ohn Cordier’s plan to
extend the external wireless range on
campus to the Pitt United slate’s] Con-
nor Harbison’sI plan to enhance the
Internet speed in Hillman Library. The
Kessler-Larkin 2012 slate’s Hans Kes-
sleris also includingasimilarmission

of library improvements. I
Kessler said inanemail thatwhile
Internet improvement is not one of

his primary initiatives, he feels that I

it would make for a better studying
environment for students alongside
hispursuit of extended library hours.

Steps toward Internet improvement,
he said, can be taken within a year-
long term‘. I A -

“I personally have experienced in-
stances where the Internet access in
Hillman is so bad that it is essentially
unusable,” Kessler said..Although he

said that he does not have an exten- - ,

sive enough knowledge of wireless

networks to be able to say how the '

problemcanbe ﬁxed, he still feels the
goal is attainable.

“There must be some steps that
can be taken, perhaps increasing
the number of routers or wireless
networks, that would improve upon
the current unworkable situation,”
he said. A I '

Universityspokesmanjohn Fedele
declined to comment on “the feasibil-
ity or relative merits of alleged candi-
date positions.” I

ﬁdent in the feasibility of their initia-
tives movinginto today’s SGB election,

with Pitt mascot Roc and posing in

a basketball game.

“Throughout my four years,
I’ve been very invested in enjoy-
ing the experience outside of the
classroom, whether it be a football
game or a walk in Schenleypar ,”
said current Board member and
presidential candidate Gordon
Louderback. “I’m just trying to show
that I’m a well-rounded person who
loves my school a lot.”

SGB candidate Sarah Winston,
running on the Fifth slate, believes
that Facebook is a place where her
slate can display its tightly bound
unity. ‘ ‘

“We are a pack, and social media
shows that we are ateam. So hope-
fully people will vote for all of us
together,” she said. “We don’t take
pictures apart. It gives avibe to the
rest of the campus that we work
together. Showing the unity shows
that we are in it for a long haul.”

In terms of outreach, candi-
dates much create traffic on their
Facebook pages by inviting as
many people as they know. The

Kessler-Larkin slate has also given
friends and supporters administra-
tor capabilities in order to bring
even more accounts onto the invi-
tation list. I
According to SGB candidate
Mary Mallampalli, the current
chair of SGB’s Community Outreach
Committee, involvement on cam-

pus has the potential to reﬂect the _

number of Facebook friends that
a given candidate might have. She
and the two other members of the
PITI‘ United slate, David Rosenthal
and Connor Harbison, are all mem-
bers of large Greek organizations
on campus.

“Reaching out to members of
our organizations has helped us to

reach out to a lot more people that ~

we otherwise would not have been
able to reach out to,” she said.-

The same holds true for Loud-
erback.

“Being able to be involved in a .

lot of student organizations has al-
lowed me to meet a lot of awesome
people, and then I was able to con-
nect to them through Facebook,”
he said.

Stieber noted that the template
for the promotional photograph
seems to prevail from term to term

even as the elections evolve. She
also utilized the same template and
was inspired to do so by the presi-
dent who ran before her. Present
candidates appear to be continuing
the same model. ’
“It doesn’t mean that it’s right or
wrong. People have just seen that
it worked,” she said. “While doing
the campaign photos and Facebook
pages and templates that have been
done for a while is so great, [candi-

dates] shouldn’t be afraid to branch

Sanapala called the recurrent I

theme a “tradition,” and she be-
lieves it is a part of how SGB elec-
tions have always been.

“I just remember seeing candi-
dates dressed up in professional
attire out front of the cathedral. You
associate people with" that image
with candidates,” she said. “I can’t
imagine how [a change] would be

Pitt’s posters of alcohol tragedies
  insulting and ineffective

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

The poster reads, “This was Gor-
don. Gordon was in his ﬁrst se-
mester of college and pledging
a fraternity. After a pledge cer-

emony, Gordon was ordered to"

drink, along with his brothers,
four handles of whiskey and six
bottles of wine in 30 minutes, or

they couldn’t leave. He did not

wake up after passing out at 11
p.m.”

A few days after this poster and
others like it went up in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union and other campus
buildings earlier this semester,
a Facebook friend of mine,»a re-
cent alumnus who asked not to
be identiﬁed by name, uploaded a
photo of the poster with the cap-
tion, “This was Gordon  He died
from being hazed, a criminal ac-
tivity. Alcohol did not kill him, the
people who forced him to drink
killed him.” ‘

My friend might not be a stu-
dent anymore, but his post re-
ﬂects the frustration many Pitt
students feel when they see these
posters, and.I’m one of them.

I hate these posters. I hate the
cartoonish melodrama of their
emphatic past-tense language and
blotted-out faces, and I think the
campaign as a whole is insensitive
and offensive to the victims.

When using a person’s death to
raise awareness for a certain kind
of tragedy, it is always important
to proceed with the utmost care

because you are using the name

and likeness of someone who did
not — could not — consent to
have that likeness used. While I’m

_ assuming the victims’ families

consented to have their children
serve as cautionary tales —— and
I hope they saw and approved the
ﬁnal drafts of the posters before
they were released —— family con-
sent is only part of making an ad

tasteful. You have to ask yourself:

If I died in some tragic way, would
I want to appear on a poster that
looked like this? Despite the best
intentions of the Office of Health
Education and Promotion —
which had not responded to re-
quests for an interview as of press
time —— I think the “This Was [So
and So]” posters fail that test.
For 'a close friend of mine'—
also unnamed because her fam-

.ily has tried to keep its tragedy

out of the media —— who lost her ‘

brother in a car crash just a little

.over a month ago, seeing the post-

ers makes her think of how she’d
feel if she saw her brother’s face

blocked out under the text “This

WAS Jason*’’ on a poster warning
against reckless driving.

“It’s triggering and thought-
less to the people who really have

lost someone,” she said.

The posters evoke disgust sim-
ilar to the ad campaign that was
pulled by the Pennsylvania Liquor
Control Board last year after crit-
ics — including the Women’s Law
Project, which I interned for at
the time —— complained about the
ads’ lurid and insensitive handling
of date rape. The ads depicted a
woman’s bare legs with her under-
wear around her ankles. The cap-
tion read “She didn’t want to do
it, but she couldn’t say no.” Femi-
nists, including myself, blogged
that the ad, in its quest to get at-
tention with shocking language
and imagery, crossed the blurry
line between “If you drink too
much, you could be raped” and
“If you drink this much, it’s your
fault if you get raped.”

The drinking-deaths campaign
makes the same misstep — its
focus on gory details, combined

. with staggering statistics regard-

ing how much the victims had to
drink, reads not as “This could
happen to you,” but rather, “How
couid they be so stupid?”

In all fairness, Lynn Gordon
Bailey_]r., the freshman who died
from hazing at the University of
Colorado, has a foundation named
after him, the Gordie Foundation,
which does focus a lotof its ener-

To the Editor,
Just last week, our generation’s
voice was heard loud and clear in

the national election. Now more A

than ever, students are seeking a
president who can relate to the is-
sues we face on a daily basis.

In Thursday’s Student Govern-
ment Board election, one presiden-
tial candidate seeks to be a true
representative of Pitt’s student
body.

Natalie Rothenberger has been
running on the platform that she
will not only bring viable and im-
portant plans to the forefront but,

V more importantly, she will also'be

connected with the student body

__after the election.” Her strong,

stance on bringing SGB and the
student body together cannot be
matched by any other candidate,
and having a president who seeks
this connection is like the gift that
keeps on giving. While all of the
SGB candidates have brought for-
ward concerns and their prospec-
tive plans to correct those issues,
no one else has offered to hear
what the students have to say.
Many students on our cam-
pus barely know what SGB is, yet
alone what it does. A candidate
who seeks a continuous, strong
connection to the student body
will strengthen the bridge between

students and the Board, which has ‘

so much inﬂuence on our campus

LETTER To THE EDITOR

activities.

It would be redundant to re-
peat Natalie’s extensive qualiﬁca-
tions, and the candidates all have
impressive accomplishments ‘to
put on their resumés. However,
she has done an exceptional job
ofbeing a leader on our campus
and still caring about the entire
student body. Natalie soars beyond
the opposition when it comes to
her ability to connect with others
and be the amiable president Pitt
needs, students need and our com-
munity needs.

"Skyfa|l”

Directed by: Sam Mendes
Starring: Daniel Craig, Judi Dench
Grade: A

Almost every generation will remember the
V debonaire acts, athletic stunts and world—saving
maneuvers ofjames Bond ——- or at least one of
the six men who have represented his character
throughout history.
And what better way to celebrate the 50th
birthday of the cinematic hero than a record-
breaking opening weekend at the box ofﬁce,

' which earned the franchise’s newest movie

$87.8 million?

The 23rd Bond ﬁlm, “Skyfall,” stars Daniel
Craig, who must track down the cause of a series
of threats on the British secret service agency
MI6. Someone has stolen and released a list of

November 15, 2012 I The Pitt News l vvvv\/v.pitmevvs.com

covert NATO operatives to the public, placing '

each operative in grave danger.
Theﬁlmbegins with Bond immediately back
in action, gracefully maneuveringa motorcycle
above the rooftops of Turkey in pursuit of the
stolen list, and the high—intensityﬁlmproceeds
accordingly. The cliche ﬁghting scene that takes
place on top of a train might seem a bit famil-

V iar — and reminiscent of past ﬁlms :— but it’s

impressive all the same. -

While previous Bond movies like “Casino "

Royale” and “Quantum of Solace” focus on
classic elements such as girls, guns and explo-
sions, director Sam Mendes incorporates more
emotional undertones into the plot of “Skyfall.”

" Instead of witnessing his usual sexual es-
capades with exotic women, we get to see the
rare, sensitive side of Bond. This time, the main
woman in, his life is M (Judi Dench), the head

. past the formality of business ‘— an

. she allows him to take on the critical mis-

   

Their professional relationship
is stripped down to slowly reveal a
mother—son connection that goes

atypical relationship for Bond and a
female character. Bond takes it upon
himselfto ensure M’s personal safety
when her past brings forward a dan-
gerous villain whose sole intention is
to destroy her.
M proves her faith in Bond when

sion oflocating this villain, despite Bond’s
failed physical and psychological exams
— the grades most likely the result of his
unexpected sabbatical. . ,

But don’t be mistaken, Bond still lives
up to his sex—icon reputation when he
meets Severine, played by the gorgeous
Berenice Marlohe. Severine has more to
offer than just a pretty face and some stun-
ning curves. She can take Bond to the root of
all of MI6’s problems: Silva. ,

Played by the brilliantjavier Bardem, Silva
is a cunning psychopath who uses his genius to

   

‘seek revenge on M. His playful attitudeserves ‘

as a foil to Bond’s no—nonsense disposition,
creating a humorous form of banter between
characters that breaks up some of the intense
action scenes. ‘

The exceptional casting and screenplay are
accompanied by cinematography that takes the
audience all over the world. From skyscrapers
in Shanghai to island casinos in Macau, it will
be no surprise if the camera workwins Roger
Deakins, the ﬁlm’s cinematographer, an Oscar.

And though this Bond ﬁlm offers moments
that are similar to the franchise’s past additions,
“Skyfall” still shows the way in which one man
can capture large crowds across decades, while
adding new plots and constant improvements
to the ﬁlms. ‘ _

“Shaken, not stirred,” Bond said. But no

matter how you prefer your drink, cheers to i

the latest addition of thejames Bond saga. I

‘Lincoln’ captivates audiences, Spielberg creates bel

Thomas ‘Visco
Staff Writer

Directed by: Steven Spielberg
Starring: Daniel Day—Lewis, Tom-
my tee Jones, Sally ‘Field, David
Strathairn .
Grade: A

Abraham Lincoln is a myth.
Collected from speeches, pho-
tographs and scraps of our politi-
cal consciousness, the Lincoln
we know today is a creation of
national memory.

In Steven Spielberg’s latest
ﬁlm “Lincoln,” Spielberg, Dan-
iel Day-Lewis and a phenomenal
cast capture the mythic Lincoln:
the politician, the visionary and
the storyteller.

The ﬁlm begins in late 1863
after two of Lincoln’s most
memorable speeches: the Eman-
cipation Proclamation and the

Gettysburg Address. Instead of
spending his time on the Civil
War’s beginnings, Spielberg
chose to focus on the war’s clos-
ing months. This allows the ﬁlm-

’maker to avoid the black hole.

that is the Gettysburg Address
— an epic moment in history no

actor could do justice — and in- .

stead promotes Spielberg’s_ Lin-
coln as a visionary, or rather, the
Lincoln weall remember —- not
the man he_was. _
Few-remember the President
Lincoln of the early war, the man

who suspended the writ of ha-

beas corpus, imprisoned thou-
sands of political dissidents and
promised the preservation of
slavery in the South in exchange
for preserving the Union. This
movie, embodying ‘our collec-
tive conscious, chooses to ignore
that Lincoln. This is not to say
that this lessens the film’s great-
ness. However, viewers should

be aware that there is much more
to the man than what “Lincoln”
shows.

Focusing on the ﬁghtto pass

the 13th Amendment, which .

ended slavery, “Lincoln” details
the president’s legislative battle

-surrounding the constitutional

amendment and the simultane-

- ous conclusion of the Civil War a

and lead up to reconstruction in
the South. In this way, we see the
visionary Lincoln, the man who
planned peaceful reconstruction,
fought for the rights of freed men
and slaves and laid the rhetorical
framework for civil rights.
Daniel- Day-Lewis is a phe-
nomenal actor, as he proved

‘in “There Will Be Blood,” but

‘Guardians’ heat up, Jack
Frost cools things down

"Rise of the Guardians"
Directed by:l Peter Ramsey
Starring: Chris Pine, Alec Bald-

win, Hugh Jackman, lsla Fisher,

Jude Law
Grade: A-

Not since the Dark Ages has fear
so paralyzed humanity, but once
again all that’s good in the world is
in jeopardy. Has everyone ﬁnally
forgotten the Guardians, under
oath to protect the children of
the world, and turned them into
a whisper? The Guardians need
help. 1

With stunning animation and
human emotions, “Rise of the
Guardians” tells a story of identity
and purpose, hope and-wonder
and the incomparable power of
imagination.

DreamWorks animates the
screen with a punch that gives
Pixar a run for its money, and the
3-D aspect of this ﬁlm has an ac-
tual purpose. Snowﬂakes ﬂoat all
around, and winter’s bright, ma-
jestic winds swirl off the screen,
giving Jack Frost (Chris Pine) a
seat right in the audience.

jack is the playful menace of
winter, and Pine boasts the same
smug magnetism he brought to
Captain Kirk in the “Star Trek”
reboot. jack represents snowball
ﬁghts, sledding, blizzards and —
most importantly -— snow days.
But for all the seasonal bliss he
brings, nobody can actually see
him. To the people of the world,
even the awe—inspired children,
jack Frost is nothing more than
a myth.

Pine gives helpless frustration
to ]ack’s late—night musings with
the Man in the Moon, his “cre-

ator,” and you see the yearning in '

his watery, cloud-grey eyes.

But when he’s plucked from the
snowy rooftops of suburbia and
summoned to the North Pole, the
Guardians — Santa (Alec Bald-
win), the Easter Bunny (Hugh
Jackman), the Tooth Fairy (Isla
Fisher) and the silent Sandman —
solicitJack’s help in their crusade
against Pitch (Jude Law). Pitch, or
the Boogeyman as he calls him-
self, is the darkness and fear that’s
been swept under beds and long
forgotten. ‘

Much to the surprise of the
Guardians, jack isn’t interested.

Election music attempts to connect

voters, does little for 

Matt Singer
PVPTS Contributor

In the early hours ofwednesday, Nov.
7, a crowded Boston convention cen-
ter rangwithasomberacappella ren-

dition of “God Bless America.” A deep

and almost monotone voice came
over the loudspeakers to interrupt
their crooning and announce former
Governor Mitt Romney’s entrance.
With no speciﬁc song waiting to be
played, the crowd had taken it upon
itselfto clear the silence that had bee
hanging in the room. -
Crowds are not used to a speech
—— or any campaign event, for that
matter — occurring without music.
on this particular night, maybe a
song, no matter how timeless or ﬁt-
ting, would not have been appropri-
ate for the circumstances. But, in a
campaign markedly accentuated by
careﬁil music selection and campaign
playlists, an event without a musical
introduction seemed almost naked.
A few months prior, the chorus
of Trace Adkins’ “Tough People Do”
resonated throughout the Republican
National Convention in Florida as at-
tendees joined into sing about people
pulling themselves up by their boot-
straps and outlasting tough times.
And 2o—sornethings were practically

drooling when President Barack
Obama’s afﬁnity for Arcade Fire be-
came well-known back in 2008. Four

.\ years later, the band’s song “We Used

To Wait,” with-its hauntingly catchy
melodies describing the tumultuous
and impatient pace of aformally iner-
tia-less lifestyle, had a comfy place on
the Obama campaign’s ofﬁcial 2012
Spotify playlist.

While those songs aren’t neces-
sarily bad, they are without a doubt
safe. On a strategic level, almost
every major political campaign at
some point touts the importance of
inclusion. Both Obama and Romney
had an encyclopedic mix of familiar
favorites — in which anyone could
ﬁnd at least one gem — waiting in
the queue to play.

Mitt Romney’s campaign playlist
featured the sort of loud and proud
Americana that his campaign fo-
cused on so heavily, with tracks like
Kid Rock’s “Bom Free” and the folksy
“I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow”
by Soggy Bottom Boys. Somewhat
atypical, though, was the inclusion of
Billboard country chart favorites and
The Killers’ 2004 super hit “Some-
body Told Me,” possibly included for
the young Ayn Rand lover yet to adopt
his parents’ affinity for rock ‘n’ roll
power ballads. '

These songs all combine to make
the perfect polymerization of the-
matic continuity. In other words, the
songs are supposed to say What the
candidate says — or is at least try-
ing to say. But there is a sort of awk-
ward disconnect between throwing a
bunch oft:rack's together and actually
examining them inthe context of the
candidate’s lifestyle, no matter how
painstakingly researched they were
beforehand. ' .

No matter how hard I try, I just
cannot picture the president curl-

_ ing up in a blanket on a dreary daya

listening to Florence And The Ma-
chine’s “You’veGot the Love” while
reading Pitchfork’s opinion of Flor-
ence Welch’s voice. I have just as
much trouble picturing a business-
man whose net worth is estimated
between $190 million and $250

million ﬁnding something in The —

Killers’ “Read My Mind” that truly
resonates with him. Maybe he likes
the part at the end with the powerful
and immersive singing of “She said I
don’t mind if you don’t mind / ’Cause
I don’t shine if you don’t shine” just as

a much as I do. Or maybe he just likes

the music video of Brandon Flowers

and company running around Tokyo.

GUARDIANS

. “You guys are hard work and deadlines,” he

comments with a grin and toss of the hand.
“I’m snow ﬁghts and fun times.” Santa’s elves
— hilariously useless in their pointy hats
and lack of motor skills —— gasp in disbelief
at his response.

It isn’t until Santa challenges him that
Jack realizes there might be hope in helping
the needy bunch. “Who are youjack‘? What
is your center?” asked the eccentric, but still
jolly, Santa. Jack has memories — a past
‘before he became Frost —— waiting for him
on the other side of this journey.

Pitch is aneloquent villain, evén allur-
ing, as he attempts to recruit Jack into his
nightmare. Tempted, by the mere notion of
being believed in, Jack is steadfast in his
resolve to never be feared like Pitch.

The Guardians draw their power from
the imagination and belief of children. But
once Pitch dims most of the wor1d’sAlight
by sabotaging Easter and the Tooth Fairy,
dreams turn to nightmares, and the Guard-
ians’ strength wanes. Jack must confront

-that which he fears most to save his new
friends and the imaginations of children
everywhere. He has to ﬁnd his center.

Certainly not afraid to borrow tropes
from children’s ﬁlms throughout history
(e.g., “Hook,” “The Goonies,” “Up,” etc.),
“Rise of the Guardians” brings the power
of dreams and belief to mystical form. It’s
probably not as funny as kids want it to be
——- Pitch has a looming presence in almost

' every scene — but there are enough laughs

to keep themlfrom restlessly squirming
in their seats. It’s hard to be bored with a
movie that features an Australian Easter
Bunny and Siberian Santa with arm tattoos
and swords, ‘

A “Do you stop believing in the moon just
because the sun comes up?” Jack asks with

a wink that provides audiences with a re—'

afﬁrmation of ﬁctional characters. And
his question_might just have some parents

leaving out plates of cookies and milk this ’

Christmas for more than just their kids’
amusement. ‘

Having validated their conceptions of
holiday heroes, youngsters will leave the
theater hopping with enchantment. I

With this need to diversify, the ﬁnished prod-
ucts of campaign playlists seem, in the end, to
lack authenticity. The eclectic utility that allows
the same playlist to be used in a college audito-
rium ﬁlled with East Coastyuppies one day and
a rally of Michigan union workers the next can
start to appear forced.

Yet, people overlook it. Maybe it is because
some people don’t mind sitting through pieces
of their mom and dad’s iPod selection so long
as they get to hear at least one indie hit before

. a politician speaks. We ignore the fact that the
candidates probably don’t even listen to the
bands they include on their lists and most likely
play a microscopic role — if any —— inthe song

selection. Are campaign theme songs so wholly ‘

negligible as long as the consensus deems them
OK and determines that they ﬁt under an over-
arching thesis on American values? '
A In anodd sort ofway, the whole thing is simi-
lar to those really cliche middle school dances
that we all went to. All of our buddies wanted to
hear a Green Day song, but that girl that you re-
ally liked wanted to hear a Nelly Furtado single.
Although they seemed to be at completely oppo-
site ends of the spectrum, the night still survived
as the music selection gravitated toward the
middle and everyone was satisﬁed. The music
. was all radio hits and jump—around pop,.but we
loved the feeling of being surrounded by our
V tween friends, having fun. ‘ -

Campaign playlists seem to operate in the
same way and really only have to obey two rules:
Do _not kill the thematic vibes, and give everyone
at least one chance to_sing along.

Senior No. 10 heavyweight Zac
Thomusseit put his opponent,
Justin Dozier, on his back in an
attempt to seal the match-win-
ning pin that could have started
the No. 18 Pitt wrestling squad
out with a victory over No. 13
Michigan.

The Panthers trailed the Wol-

verines 16-12 heading into the

ﬁnal match, and the six points
from a pin would’ve meant a
win for Pitt. But Thomusseit’s
performance resulted in a 6-0
decision — worth only three
points to the team — and the
Panthers lost.

Pitt fell to the Wolverines 16-
15 in its first dual meet of the
season in Ann Arbor, Mich., Sun-
day. The team hurt itself with a
slow start, losing four ofits first

Conference tournament starts Friday

Senior Staff I/Vrizfer

With a Big East Tournament
berth on the line, the Panther
Volleyball team rallied to end
their season with two confer-
ence victories. Those two wins,
along with outside help, secured
a place in the tournament for the
Panthers.

Pitt (17-13, 7-8 Big East) de-
feated Seton Hall Friday night,
and after DePaul’s upset of St.
John’s, a 3-1 win over the Vil-
lanova Wildcats Sunday put the
Panthers in the tournament.

,_,, Pitt head coach Toby Rens be-

lieves that his team is entering
the Big East Tournament play-
ing their best volleyball of the
season.

“I am pleased with how the
team came together in the past
few weeks,” Rens said. “We are
peaking at the right time.”

The Panthers finished sev-
enth in the Big East regular
season, putting them within
the conference’s top‘ eight teams
that make the postseason tour-
nament. The tournament begins
with ﬁrst-round matches this
Friday at Marquette University
in Milwaukee, Wis.

In their opening match, the
Panthers will face the host team,
The Golden Eagles, which fin-
ished the season in second place
in the conference and compiled
a record of25—4 overall and 13-2
in the Big East.

The Panthers and the Golden
Eagles met for a regular season

match at Marquette on Oct. 5.
The Golden Eagles prevailed 3-1
in a four-set match.

-In their previous contest,
the Golden Eagles out-hit the

Nate Barnes
Stcyj” Wrz'ter

DraftExpress.com describes Pitt bas-
ketball’sJames Robinson as a “tough
and team—oriented player” in its pro-
ﬁle of the freshman guard.

After Pitt’s 78-53 dismantling of
Lehigh and its superstar, sure-ﬁre
NBA draft-pick C.J. McCollum Tues-

_ ._day, Robinson has put both of these
" "q"ual_ities on full display in just three

regular season games. _

Looking at the game’s box score,
one would think McCollum had a
pretty solid performance. He tallied
17 points on 7-for—11 shooting, includ-
ing 3-4 from 3-point range. He also
turned the ball over ﬁve times.

McCollum, a 6-foot—3, 190-pound
guard, will likely become a lottery
pick in the 2013 NBA Draft.

One scout in attendance Tues-
day described his skill set as such:

“[McCollum] can play multiple posi-'

tions, which makes him more valu-
able,” he said. “He’s aﬁmdamentally
sound, solid player, and even when
outmatched, like last night, he still
makes the right plays, right passes,
right cuts and right drives. He really
plays the game effortlessly.”
McCollum, a 6-foot-3, 190-pound
guard, burst on to the national bas-
ketball scene during the NCAA tour-
nament earlierthis yearwhen he and
No. 15 Lehigh delivered astunningup—
set of No. 2 Duke. Inabattle of guards,
McCollum outplayed Austin Rivers
-— the No. 10 overall pick in_]une’s

Frshman guard mes Ryobinson not the better of eigs.c-

defense stiﬂes McCollum

NBA Draft — with a 30-point, six-

rebound and six-assist performance.
McCollum will likely become a

lottery pick in the 2013 NBA Draft.

Back to Tuesday.

Prior to the game, head coach
Jamie Dixon said Robinson would
start as the primary defender on Mc-
Collum. If anyone has heard Dixon
speak of Robinson,‘he raves about
his defense —— and for good reason.

5 “[Robinson] is deceptively ath-
letic. He’s got good size, he’s smart,
he’stou ,”Dixonsaid.“It’sveryrare
to have a freshman who can defend
as he can.”

Tuesday night, Robinson and the
Panthers locked down McCollum
for almost every single one of the 31
minutes the latter spent on the floor.
Robinson and Trey Zeigler drew the
actual assignment of marking McCol-

lum, but the entire Panther defense

played a huge role in neutralizing him.
“It’s gotta be team defense with
[McCollum] . He uses a lot of ball
screens, and you gotta handle those
well,” Dixon said.
The Panthers handled just about

‘everything Lehigh threw at them,

especially the team’s attempts to get
McCollum open and put the basket-
ball in his hands — most notably,
through ball screens.

Robinson ranthrough and around
just about every single screen any

' him, similar to the way in‘which fresh-

wanted to be, and obviously we wanted
to come out with the win, but it was a
good effort.” ’

The Panthers will.look to build on
both the offensive and defensive perfor-
mances they posted in the final matches
of the season. ‘

A Against Seton Hall and Villanova, the
Panthers had four players contribute
double-digit kill figures, representing
a balancedscoring effort that has.been
a season-long goal, according to senior
Alexa Campbell.

“We are playing really well for each
other right now,” Campbell said. “Every
hitter is making a presence, and that has
been a huge part of ourwins.” '

In the Seton Hall match, the Panthers
recorded a season-high 96 digs, with
senior libero Margy Acton accounting
for 31. f

In terms of blocking, the Panthers
once again finished the season strongly



ti.

by earning a season-high 16 in their final
match against Villanova. Monica Wignot
ﬁnished with a team—best eight while

Jasmine Dittrich and Campbell earned

seven and six, respectively. .

For the Panthers, the most important
aspect of their tournament match will be
focusing on their own game without wor-
rying extensively about what Marquette
does on its side of the net.

“Our team approach has been one
point at a time throughout the last few
matches, and that needs to continue for
Marquette,” Campbell said. “Focusing
on working together will be key, as will
staying in the moment.” ‘ A A

Wignot agreed, noting that the team’s
focus must remain on its members’ own
preparation for the approaching match.

“The biggest challenge will be making
sure we focus on what we need to do and
not the big picture,” Wignot said. “We
need to worry about us, not Marquette.”I

Post—game, McCollum was a man of few '

words. . _
5 “They did a good job overall,” McCollum
said when asked about Pitt’s defensive effort
and, of course, that of Robinson.
Robinson exuded quiet conﬁdence when
reﬂecting upon his lockdown performance. ’
“I justwanted to be solid. Iknow the coaches
putalot of trustin me to check [McCollum] right
from thejump ball,” Robinson said. “I know my
team trusts me, and they have my back.”
And solid Robinson was. Pitt as a whole did
a great job making sure McCollum couldn’t do
to them what he did to Duke.
“Pitt is one of the best defensive teams inthe
country. That’s their M.O.,” the scout said. “The

him to the left. Every time he went to the basket,
he ran into double-teams. On pick—and—rolls,

. Pitt got the ball out of his hands.”

But Robinson stepped up more than any
other Panther._ ‘ A ‘
Defensively, he didn’t take his eyes off Mc

Collum. Every time down the ﬂoor; Robinson

face—guarded McCollum, preventinghimfrom _

even touching the ball on many of Lehigh’s of-
fensive sequences. » A
One particular example of this pattern came
"right out of the gate inthe ﬁrst half. After McCol-
lum scored on Lehigh’s ﬁrst two possessions to

A give_the Mountain Hawks a 5-2 lead in the open-

ing minutes, it seemed McCollum was about
to turn in an impressive performance —- one
with which any ofthe dozen-or—so NBA scouts

in the media section would present to their
respective general managers, salivating over
the kid’s scoring prowess and ability to guide
a team like Lehigh to victory over a nationally
prominent team like Pitt.

Robinson made sure that didn’t happen.

McCollum didn’t even touch the ball on his
team’s following three possessions. When he
got the ball next, he turned it over. By the time
McCollum was able to have any sort of say in
the game, it was already heading in Pitt’s favor.

So, when looking at the box_ score, people
will likely say McCollum “got his,” and the rest
of the Mountain Hawks couldn’t keep up.
