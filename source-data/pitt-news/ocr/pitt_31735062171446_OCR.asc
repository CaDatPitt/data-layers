WILLIAM KUNSTLER

by ELLEN GANLEY

William Kunstler and Rennie Davis came to
Pittsburgh Friday night to talk about repression to
more than two thousand people at the Carnegie Mu-

are Hall.

Paul Boas. a member of the Student Bar Asso-
ciation at the University introduced Kunstler. He
asserted that the speakers were not allowed on the
Pitt and C-MU campuses because “as long as they
(Pitt and C-MU) are corporate institutions. they
cannot allow people like William Kunstler and Ren-
nie Davis to express their ideas on campus.“

When Kunstler took the podium. he explained
that he had taken part in legal presentations on a
local court riot case that afternoon. Kunstler and
a Pittsburgh attorney filed injunctions against Dis-
trict Attorney Roberg Duggan. Sergeant Francis
Quinlan of the Fraternal Order of Police and five
Pittsburgh policemen.

KUNSTLER BLASTS REPRESSION

The first charge of repression that Kunstler
made was in reference to the House Internal Secur-
ity Committee's list of radical speakers who have
been appearing on college campus. The list was di-
vided into 12 categories. including the Commun-
ist Party. the Chicago Conspiracy. and the Black
Panther Party.

‘ ‘He contended that this list was "more than just
an announcement of Who‘s Who on American Col-
lege, Campuses. It’s really a warning to the col-
leges." Kunstler went on to argue that the members
of the list were considered "dangerous people. The
Establishment decided they should not be heard by

- the people.“

unstler maintained that recently there has
be n a series of events that have increased the re-
pression of youth in America. The first he cited was
President Nixon's recent letter condemning col-
lege professors for their part in radicalizing college
students. He also stated that Margaret Mitchell’s
outbursts, “the most recent of which blamed all of

the country’s problems on the colleges,” are not

helping the situation.

The, Chicago Seven‘s attorney next cited the
Portage County investigation of the Kent State inci-
dent as a prime example of repression. The report
of this inquest asserted that the “students were to-
tally guilty of suicide on the campus of Kent State."

The only censure the court gave the National
Guard was a suggestion that the Guard should not
carry M-1 rifles because. as Kunstler put it. "the
holes they left were too big."

Two of the students injured in the riot have been

indicted for rioting. Kunstler believes that "this
was a bold move to make the victims the culprits."
THE REAL CRIMINALS

Kunstler suggested that the Ten Most Wanted
List is "a~pub_lic relations stunt pulled by the FBI."

Such. people as H. Rap Brown and Bernadine Dohrn; g

the"‘people you know," are-nowffound on the list.

-_I(_ixiiistler-,stated} that "the people of "this cioupntry 3 . g _

by one. I've never seen the real criminals on the Ten
Most Wanted List._I‘ve never seen Richard Nixon.

General Westmoreland. or Spiro T. Agnew up there.”

Kunstler believed that the government is “mo-
tivated by the greatest tyrant of all “fear.’_’ Fear
turns people into animals and democracies into
totalitarian states.”

He asserted that "the government is creating
fear on one hand and claiming law and order on the
other. How can you respect a government like
that?" ‘

ALTERNATIVES TO REPRESSION

Discussing alternatives. Kunstler said that "all
of us must now band together as we did in May and
determine that they shall not take us over until we
are all dead. They shall not turn us into a Nazi state
without a fight.“ He advised all his listeners to
band together and fight in any way your conscience
dictates."

Kunstleradvised the crowd to consider two fac-
tors before taking action. He said that "if you go
from one plateau (of action) to the next. be sure you
have completely exhausted the first plateau. If you
go from one plateau to another and you find you

must use violence. be as humanitarian as possible.“
Kunstler concluded his speech by saying. “You ‘

are young. You are _free of most of the baggages of
middle age. You are being persecuted by all kinds
of medieval laws. by "threats of financial cut-offs.
by pressures from your parents and institutions.

"If you believe that the Weathermen and the lib-
erals have the feeling for a free world and an’open
society. then for the love of God. stay together. If
we spend our time nipping at each others tails.
they will take over and the horror will begin." he
said.

DAVIS RAPS NIXON AND WAR
Rennie Davis began by describing the “horrors"
that are taking place in South Vietnam and said that
the South Vietnamese are becoming “politically
conscious."

The former Chicago defendant believed that
even South Vietnamese diplomats are coming out
for “independence and freedom from American im-
perialism.” Even Viet veterans are "returning with
a sort of non-verbal unity against the war." he con-
Unued.

Davis pointed out that directly after President
Nixon's “token peace plan, "the Viet Cong proposed
a counter plan. One of the terms of the plan was to-
tal withdrawal by a set date. Davis believes that “if
the people of this country knew of‘*the points of this
plan. they would support it."

ORDINARY PEOPLE CAN WIN

He stated that "new delegations should bypass
federal channels. The American people should ne-
gotiate their own treaty with the people of Viet-
nam." Davis then asserted that the “Paris Eight
Point Treaty should be brought to this country and
presented to every town."

Subsidy

by POHLA SMITH

“Public institutions often end
up favoring the privileged."

Quoting Benjamin Franklin. Lt.
Governor Raymond J. Broderick.
Republican gubernatorial candi-
date. attacked the state‘s present
program of aid to higher educa-
tion while. speaking at Stephen
Foster Memorial Friday after-
noon.

Broderick advocated dropping
the program which subsidized tui-
tion at state-owned and state-re-
lated institutions in favor of one
under which all aid to higher edu-
cation would be allocated to stu-
dents.

Tuition at all of the 149 private
and public institutions would then
be nearly equal. A student would
be given “realistic amounts to en-
able him to go to the college of his
or her choice.” The aid would be
in the form of part scholarship-
part loan. He would “pay on his
ability to pay.

Broderick criticized the subsi-
dized tuition program for two rea-
sons.

Aid to-colleges “subsidizes col-
lege ‘tuition for families who can
afford to pay as well as for out of
state students.“ The program has
failed. Broderick said. in “enabl-
ing a high school graduate to go on
to college despite his family‘s fin-
ancial situation.“

All colleges are suffering from
financial problems .“due to in-
creased ,enrollment and the rising
costs of education,” Broderick ar-
gued. As a result, tuition is rising
at private institutions while state-
owned institutions are able to hold
their tuition down with the help of
state aid.

Consequently. Broderick feels.
there is a gap developing between
the price of private and public in-
stitutions. “If the gap worsens."
the candidate declared. “a class

Reactions of department chair-
men to the recently released Stu-
dent Government Course Evalua-
tion booklet have been mixed.

The most recurring criticism
was the low response which. in
some cases, was less than 25
per cent of the total.

Rudy Potenzone. co-chairmen
of the SG committee which pro-
duced the course evaluation book,
explained that “there was a great
deal of student apathy. perhaps
‘because students were uncertain
what the computer evaluation
cards sent to there were all
about.“

The second reason for the poor
response involve the problems the
committee itself encountered.

Because of a memo lost by the
printers, the address labels were
four weeks late getting to the
committee,

meet objections stated by many

. professors.

However, not all criticism to-

A specific criticism was made by
Dr. William Keefe, chairman of

in the book was not congruent with

to him.

. Of the 13 cards returned for a
certain Political Science course,
nine cards were very favorable,
two unfavorable, and two ambival-
ent. Yet the written evaluation in
the book was highly negative.

There also appeared a quoted

Co-chairman Goldberg, who was
in charge of the written section,
explained that the evaluations
were split up among different
members of the committee. With

the large number of courses being
evaluated, she could not check
each course description.

She stated that the person re-
sponsible for the mistake would
be approached and then added.

“The proof of my faith in the-

written section is the i'act that I
had no qualms at all when giving
the cards to the department
heads. . . . I had no idea that an
evaluation had been falsified."

Potenzone. who will be heading
the committee for the’ next two
terms. stated that the question-
naire has been revised so that the
written comments will be drawn
from the objective statistics. The
next questionnaire. he said. will
-have fewer questions and will be
more objective.

“Although there will be a space
for comments,” Potenzone de-
clared, “the next questionnaire

will lessen the subjective human
error.” I

three times a week in large sec-

The cyle is completed. explain-
ed Boggs. with the requirement
that teaching assistants “attend

available to assist him or her.

: _ _A recurring theme in the criticism of my articles is the theory

A A recent letter to the editor used wage conditions of auto work-
ers as example that American workersdo quite well. Although I take
up ‘exception to the wage given in the letter, the author seems to think
that crumbs off the master’s table is gourmet eating.

  O, _ ' t- Not only does he find the inadequate wage substantial but never

M . ° People who did not make the car were getting twice as much out

byRIC"HARD LEAVY

According to the calendar we are in an election
year. And according to the billboards we are enter-
ing the heat of an election campaign.

Some heat.

Shapp and Broderick have been saying the same
things for months, Scott has won the election al-
ready, no one is quite sure if Sesler is runni_ng at
all. From the looks of things, everywhere, Twe-
dledee is running and not too hard at that. against
Tweedledum. It has been so long since we all had a
chance to really hate in a campaign (perhaps back
to Goldwater) that the only thingleft to hate is the
electoral proccess itself.

I GOT TO THINKING that way after witness-
ing a most interesting interplay of youth and mid-
dle-age. A college-age girl was standing in front of
the Giant Eagle weigheddown with campaign leaf-
lets and buttons seemingly not very happy about
the cool drizzle and the lack of interest in the pass-

ersby. But then a_ grey-haired man appeared from ‘

the store and the fun began. He spotted her Shapp
button, “politics" triggered in his mind, and he

wanted to sound off. Shapp or Broderick or Smith,‘

the girl was a representative of the political sys-
tem and personalities were of no importance.

' His harangue went something like this:

“These politicians——a bunch -of crooks and
cheats every last one of them! You know what they
say, money. Money! That’s all! Either they're
crooks before they get into office, or once they get
there. And it doesn’t matter if it’s Harrisburg or
Washington or anywhere else. A politician is a liar.
Every last one of them. So tell me what difference
does it make? Vote for Shapp or vote for Broder-
ick or—you see how Johnson turned out. And this
goddamn Nixon. Oh, they’re great people! To hell
with it all, girl.” p

AND THEN HE left. Throughout his speech the
Shapp girl had stood there nodding. As soon as he
was finished he walked on, leaving the girl holding
out a leaflet to his retreating back. She looked at
me, and shaking her head, she said, “Talk about
alienation.” * 5

In recent years the cry, directed mostly to-
ward the young, has been to “get involved." From
all sides the youth today is assaulted with warn-
ings about apathy. '

As a result a plethora of causes have arisen‘

manned by the concerned minority of students. Sig-
nificantly, these organizations have not dealt di-
rectly with the American political experience.
Generally they relate to the outer fringes of po-
litics (Women’s Lib, Black Power, Ecological con-
cern) or with the refutation of the existing power
structure (SDS, Revolutionary Socialist Union).

THE TRADITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, the

Young Democrats and the Young Republicans, ,

maintain relatively low levels of interest. Indeed,
members of such organizations are sometime un-
comfortable with thier position of supporting can-
didates they see as dubious at best.

The New Right, in the form of the Young Amer-
icans for Freedom, however, controversial, have

' not attracted even barely significant numbers.

In short, for whatever the reasoning, students
are demonstrating a marked lack of interest in this

‘ year's elections and in the electoral process in gen-

eral, as have their parents.

WHY SHOULD two dissimilar portions of so-
ciety view Nov. 3 with a yawn and a shrug of hope-
lessness? ‘ .

First off, it is something of a shaky venture to
postulate the inner workings of the mind in gener-
al, much less the mysteries which go on inside the

’ voter’s head.

P...»

Palitiés  arm 50   yrs: more 7;-

In the 1968 Presidential election less than 61
per cent of eligible voters turned up at the polls.
Were those 40 million people who stayed home
thinking “all politicians are clowns anyway” or
“any politician will do a good enough job” or some-
thing else? Regardless of rational, ho-humming the
elections is an American cultural fact.

IT WOULD SEEM that disaffected middle-aged ‘

people. like our man at the Giant Eagle, look at
their past history of voting as a waste of time.
“Look at what it’s got me," he might say, “a lot of
aggravation."

Still having a hard time paying for things he
bought on time, he sees every paycheck eaten into
by an increased cost of living. The college kids
make no sense, the city around him is dying (as-
suming. it once lived), and all the promises of 30
years of assorted campaigns make for ironic jo!{7_,
and material for harangues when confronting po-
litical workers.

No wonder “politician" has connotations of
crookedness. 

THE STUDENT view may be a more sophisti-
cated one. involving a politically more mature un-
derstanding of the causes behind political ineffec-
tiveness. But the result is the same-—disaffection.
One’s. appreciation of theforces at work may ‘in-
clude anything from C. Wright Mills’ theory to a
neo-Marxian orientation, still you are, by not cast-
ing a ballot, saying all politicians are a bunch of

7 bums.

In a move to dynamically involve the Pitt stu-
dent in the electoral process of 1970, the Universi-
ty created the Citizens’ Information Center (CIC).
The plans for CIC were drawn up immediately af-
ter the outrage of Kent State and the CambodL..n
adventure and the ensuing student political frenzy.

Ideas for CIC included, and now include, the
Pitt student gathering candidate information to
more effectively campaign, performing public
services such as demonstrating the operation of
voting machines, and generally expanding the stu-

> ' dents’ awareness of his role in the nation’s politics.

FROM THE meager response shown by stu-
dents to CIT, the post—Cambodia frenzy is long
played out. The valuable services CIC could per-

form do not appear to be reaching fruition in time,‘

for this election. ‘

Students, in fact, are often disgruntled to learn
that the two days electioneering recess, which
most had no vote in ‘deciding, may negate the pos-
sibility of the two-day reading period before finals.

Mature or otherwise. students and older citi-
zens alike look on the campaign with smirks. And‘
while the people in CIC must hold to a basic trust
that their involvement will affect the results of the
election, even the co-ordinator of the project, Mrs.
Jane Thompson, expressed hopelessness with the
State Legislative races.

(L?

“YOU LOOK FOR the less incompetant man.
You can’t expect top-calibre people to be attracted
to the job of State Legislator with the salary which
is paid. Good people can’t afford to be in Harris-
burg from Sunday to Wednesday and still main-
tain their own job responsibilities.”

Perhaps then, the liberal ideal of “just get in-
volved in the system and work on it” is beginning
to wither. Looking at the American electoral pro-
cess from a historic perspective, this ideal long
ago started to fray at the edges.

Amidst the despondency of the time, we cannot
afford to ‘see this laudable liberal ethos disinte-
grate entirely, for should it go, the goal of partici-
patory democracy goes with it. '

can only result in “slavery.“.

CONSERVATISM, they assure
us, is the best alternative be-
cause of its “stress on the inher-
ent value of the individual and
his basic right to be free from
restrictions of arbitrary force."

Historically, however, the es-
sence of conservatism, from
Burke, De Maistre, and Metter-
nich to William F. Buckley, Jr.,
has been resistance to any so-
cial change, which threatens the
wealth, power and comforts of
the dominant social strata.

Dogmatic defense of the stat-
us quo and self-righteous elit-
ism, embellished with impres-
sive phraseology—-these are hall-
marks of such conseryatism.
The conservatives of the past

favored a_strong state, to control ”

(while accepting, often enthusi-
astically, the right-wing dicta-
torships of Franco, Salazar,
Chiang Kai-shek, etc. ).

THE continuity is clear, how-
ever, when we observe that. al-
though they denounce “bigness"
in government and labor unions,

‘R they are strangely silent about

the gigantic corporations which
dominate out society.

The top 100, corporations in
this country own 58 per cent of
all corporate assets; one per
cent of all adults hold. 76 per
cent of all corporate shares, one-
half of one per cent of the pop-
ulation owns more than 25 per
cent of all wealth. (See G. Wil-
liam Domhoff, Who Rules Amer-
ica? 1967.)

Because they favor it.)

YAF is more concerned with
fighting against all forces
threatening this status quo than

I with seeing that social injus-

tice is eliminated. Their col-
umns and letters in the Pitt
News are concerned exclusive-
ly with attacking liberals and
radicals. Poverty, racism, ex-
ploitation of workers, militar-
ism, pollution, even the fantas-
tic tuition increases at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh - these
are at best secondary concerns
to them.

The best alternative to such
conservatism, I’d suggest, is
Marxism. Marxists don‘t claim
that society is more important
than individuals. We too believe
in “the inherent value of the in-
dividual." That’s why we argue

 that 1)" all individuals have a

right -to a”decent life, 2) the

.1 V.

   

ity for each individual, and 3)
individuals should collectively
control the socio-economic
forces which shape their lives.

The socialism that Marxists
advocate is not an alternative
to democracy but an extension
of it. Socialism means the dem-
ocratic control of the economic
institutions which shape needs
rather than create private prof-
its for corporations.

A COLLECTIVIZED economy
minus democracy is at best only
halfway to socialism, and those
who point to dictatorships and
other flaws in Russia, China,
and other Communist-led na-
tions are proving, not that so-
cialism equals slavery, but that
these nations have yet to fully

by JOSEPH BLASI

I went this summer to the cen-
ter of a whole movement in my-
self that has been gradually build-
ing, asking the questions. “Can I
be me? What will happen if I take
a load of time—like three straight
weeks—to express me to you and
explore the maze of feelings and
communications between us?"

I decided along with 150 others

I to stick around until we express-

(7 t

ed ourselves. There were no
tasks. no work, no talks or lec-
tures. just room for meetings.

All of us met every few days in
a large room. It was usually quite
emotional since we had no leader
or agenda. The rest of the time
was sp_ent in small encounter
groups that changed about every
three days (or in periods depend-
ing on how persons felt). Let me
tell you about me. before I go on.

UNUSUAL FOR ME

It has not been usual for me to
take a lot of time with people to
be. to express. to explore. to let
the precious and strange parts
emerge. without having my own
little plan, or role. or agenda.

Since I was small I have been
manipulated. taught that what-
ever I wanted. felt. or. was at the
moment, could not be my emer-
gency. Should, should. should was
the story of me. living death.

I have been overpowered. con-
trolled. and manipulated in the
name of great things: love. God.
country. democracy. concern. ed-
ucation. immediate fun. intellig-
gence . . . I was manipulated and
I learned so well how to do it to
you; this has been my main ex-
perience of human relationships.

For the first timein my life I
have experienced an alternative
to this. Those three weeks (on top
of 20 years of manipulation and

scattered love) were very radical I

for me. I use that word radical
and I wonder if you know it does-
n‘t mean a lot of external stuff.

It means going to the roots. I
went to my roots. I saw them. I
let others see them. I laughed. I
cried. Italked. llistened. Ifought.
I stayed. I was afraid. I hated. I
loved.

I had time to do this. and I felt
a little safe since the others began

to show that they were like me. .

My facades and games. I felt.
were not all necessary. and slow-
1y I let go. I really began to meet
people wherever they were. with
whatever feelings that had at the
time. with whatever feelings I had
at the time.

A RISK

It was risky to be me and spend
a lot of time with others without
being able to predict the outcome.
My games at least are predict-
able: I fake it or I lose or I take
over sornone. Simple.

I felt freer than ever before.
These other persons were now ex-
ploring their feelings about me.
telling me where roads seemed
blo ked. telling me when they
felt they encountered me.

When I felt as if I were re-
sponing to different persons in
ways I never felt free to respond.
I also began to explore parts of
me I used to close off. especially

I feel as if I‘m scrambling now
trying to say that from this free
occasion I came more liberated.
less controlled. less controlling.
more loving. lknow now that the
defeating games do not have to be.

I have found an alternative to
the way I have lived. I‘m not a
“people freak" for I do not find
myself running around being gut-
sy. open. and sensitive with ev-
eryone ll tried that and its total-
itarian.

BUT I’M AFRAID

I'm scared because I do not fit
into programs. philosophies. and
institutions as well as I did be-
fore. I have more trouble falling
in love because I'm not interest-
ed in being a companion of defeat
I don‘t want to overpower some
one. I‘m taking more responsibil-
ity for what I say and feel and am.
and I tend less to be a detached
critic and complainer. I feel my-
self wanting more to rt ‘ate to'the
people wherever they are.

I‘m less frustrated by the poll-
tical situation in this country be-
cause I now know how easily a
nation can be organized towards
death. when individuals like my-
self run around screaming about
oppression and never get to it in
themselves and their relation-
ships!

I believe that much of the new
richness being recovered ‘through
person-to-person encounter will
be the center for overhauling gov-
ernment and the politics of death
in this nation. As a result of what
has happened and is happening in
me with others. I feel hope.

In his haste to point the "irele-

ard McDonough ignores pertinent
gpassages in my letter. He recalls

ganywhere in the world, especially
, n the Socialist countries.“ Mc-
5Donough replies: "So what.
hould this prevent anybody from
 trying to make their situation bet-
 ter?“ _

_ If McDonough had carefully
 read my letter he would have ob-
§served that I said. “Strikes and
 protests underscore freedom to
 express dissatisfaction and to
 seek improvements, hallmarks of
 democracy." Later I stated. “It is

Quite obviously I applaud a per-

tion. McDonough can neither lit-
erally understand nor interpret
my remarks. Note that his other
critical comments never pass be-
yond the catchword “irrelevant.“

My challenge stands: establish
Marxism, utopian or otherwise,
as a viable way of life before of-
fering it as constructive alterna-
tive to democracy.

If McDonough‘s sort of reason-
ing was as “common" as mine,
then his mind would not be the
mental slum which it is. McDon-
ough does not logically refute my
statements or credibly assert an
argument of his own.

He cannot even punctuate prop-
erly. The Silent Majority recog-
nizes that McDonough and those
who think similarly thrive on ban-
alities.

MEREDITH STOPS PUBLICATION -

OF NEW COLLEGE MAGAZINE

THE MAGAZINE, a Meredith Corporation magazine for college students,
which had scheduled its first issue for October will not be published.

Robert A. Burnett, Meredith vice—president and general manager of
the Magazine Division, said lack of advertising support forced the decision
to stop publication two weeks prior to the scheduled mailing of the Octo-

Meredith had published two prototypes of The Magazine in Novem-
ber, 1969, and March, 1970, for distribution to advertisers and agencies. The
first issue, carrying eight pages of advertising, was to be sent to one million
students on campuses across the nation. The Magazine was to be circulated
on a controlled basis and published seven times during the school year.

Burnett said, ’This deicision does not change our belief in the need for
an effective publication to reach college students. We were convinced of
this when the decision to publish was made a year ago after a year of re-
search and planning. We were confident we had the product to serve stu-
dents and the means to reach them.

”However, the general slowdown in economic activity today which has
caused reductions in advertising budgets made continuing of The Maga-
zine an unacceptable risk.”

Drama Review

Pittsburgh was treated to a
rare and professionallt-acted
Shakespearean play last Wednes-
day evening as the National
Shakespeare Company- presented
the comedy Muc Ado About Noth-
ing at Carnegie Music Hall.

Essentially. the comedy is cen-
tered around the ambiguity of
love. showing not only the serious
side. but primarily the comic.
light moments of love.

Very few flaws marred the eve-
ning‘s performance. and those
few were very minor indeed with
respect to the total show.

The sets for example, were
simple and brightly colored, and
proved the perfect vehicle for
Shakespearean comedy. Since the
same set was used throughout,
and change of scene was marked
only by change in costumes or
lighting. Swift transition was up-
held and none of the comedy was
lost.

Perhaps the only questionable
staging device was the use of
Christmas-like lights during the
masked-ball scene. and in one
other scene later in the produc-
tion. ,

These lights seemed quite out
of place for this type of play. and
many in the audience were puz-
zled by their purpose. One of the
sets of lights was even set up in
the form of a star in a tree. The
play waould not have suffered in
the slightest is these lights had
been omitted entirely.

The cast themselves handled
the dialogue expertly and with
perfect diction, never losing the
mood of the play and destroying
it for the audience. However, the
opening minutes seemed awkward
for the cast, resulting in some-
what sloppy diction and extreme
rapidity of speech. This was only
a temporary thing as the cast

quckly warmed up to a fast, fresh, .

Finley as Benedict, Judith Hink as Beatrice (foreground). Rear: Saax Brad-

and lively pace, never allowing
any of Shakespeare’s jokes to go
unnoticed.

All the actors. even down to the
smaller parts. showed nearly
equal expertise in the clarity of
their delivery. including their ef-
fective use of body language and
attention to the details which
comprised the characters they
were portraying.

Although it is difficult to single
out one particular actor in the
cast. one of the high points of the
night was found in the lead couple
of Beatrice (Judith Hink) and
Benedick (Wes Finlay).

Both Miss Hink and Mr. Finlay
successfully carried off the intel-
lectual bantering of the couple.
They tossed around insults with
the greatest of ease, never letting
up on their verbal attacks. Even
at the announcement of their wed-
ding, the pair still ‘stayed amus-
ingly in character.

Finlay best portrayed Bene-
dicks bashfullness in love scenes
with Beatrice. and Beatrice was
molded into a strong. flippant. yet
feminine character.

Harlan Schneider provided
much entertainment with his dis-
tinctive portrayal of Don John.
Don John was presented as an in-
secure and humorous villian.
weak and feminine. and slightly
childish. marked by his great ena-
moration of his to_v. a small cup
and ball.

Slapstick comedy was quite
successful due to the cameo per-
formances of Richard Beebe
(Dogberry) and Chris Root (Ver-
ges). The pair, primarily Dogber-
ry, comically murdered English
with impossible coinages and uses
of malapropisms. This constabu-
lary group proved themselves
great stage clowns as they fro-
licked back and forth, keeping the
audience in gales of laughter.

Those who have the tendency of
worrying about understanding
Shakespeare and who have the
opinion that Shakespeare is al-
ways serious and difficult. would
have gone away in a completely
different state. They could not
have helped but leave the theater
in a bright state of mind. thor-
oughly comprehending each joke
and action.

It is certainly a shame that the
company was here for but one per-
formance. Pittsburgh could use
more well-acted Shakespeare
such as this.

tions) is not be offered for two

ed. "Your channels. Mr. Nixon.
are closed. Your time is up. If the
government does not stop the war
in Vietnam. we will stop the gov-
ernment."

Davis is presently organizing a
march on Washington that will at-
tempt to close down all govern-
ment activity for one day. He said
that the march will be a massive.
not violent campaign to clog the
streets of Washington. It will cre-
ate an international crisis and
give the Vietnamese people a
chance to move."

Davis finished his speech by as-
serting. “We are against the war
machine. Ordinary people can
win.

WOMEN’S UNION CALLS
FOR UNITY '

The Pittsburgh Radical Wom-
en’s Union preceded the male
speakers. taking the opportunity
to explain the goals and "strug-
gles" of the local womens liber-
ation group.

Their speech. attacking sexism.
charged that "women are op-
pressed and our oppression is to-

lives. We are exploited as sex ob-
jects. breeders. domestic
vants. and cheap labor. We are
considered inferior beings. whose
only purpose is to enhance men's
lives. Our humanity is denied
while our prescribed behavior is
enforced by the threat of physical
violence." This initial statement
met with some hostility from the
crowd. \

A spokeswoman announced that

Angela Davis who is being held
without bail in the Womens
House of Detention in New York.

cluded by proclaiming. "We call
on all our sisters to unite with us
in struggle. We call on all men to
give up their male privileges and
support womens liberation in the
interest of our humanity and their
own.

"In fighting for our liberation
we will always take the side of
women against their oppressors.

“I’m convinced this program
would give students a wider
choice,” he affirmed as he closed
his speech. “There will be no sac-

portunity.

To the audience's surprise.
Richard Shapp. son of Brodericks
opponent Milton Shapp. stepped
up to the microphone in a question
period to demand an explanation
of some of Brodericks radio and
television commercials.

These commercials a c c u se

Shapp of giving bail to “hippies
at the Chicago Democratic Con-
vention in 1968.

Young Shapp questioned Brod-
erick in a voice charged with emo-
tion, “How can you run ads like
you do . . . that are causing pain to
my family? When will you face
the issues?”

Off guard. the GOP candidate
hesitated. “Do you want me to an-

Alinsky Vents Spleen

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Saul Alinsky is a grandfatherly-
looking man. with sagging chins.
baggy pants. a wrinkled raincoat.
and a battered suitcase. If you did-
n‘t know better. you'd swear he
was Willy Loman come back to
prove he could still sell.

But you do know better. and
within minutes of meeting the

I man who calls himself a “profes-

sional radical." you are convinced
of the appropriateness of the title.

Barely off the plane that
brought him to Firday nights Ur-
ban Affairs Conference. Alinsky
found abundant cause to vent
spleen: the hotel I“that damn bed
needs a bedboard"t; his fellow
panel members ("you mean I'm
going to have to listen to three
other guys speak?" I. our fair city
t“yeah. Pittsburgh. the city
where ‘every crucifix has a pic-
ture of Andrew Mellon t."

Alinsky has made a career of
venting spleen. organizing other-
wise helpless groups to help
them fight often powerful institu-
tions. In the past, Alinsky and his
interpid bands have grappled suc-
cessfully with such giants as the
Eastman-Kodak Co. and Mayor
Richard Daley of Chicago.

"You can’t organize on the bas-
is of values." says the 60-year-
old Alinsky. "You must find the
common need among people. If I
go into a neighborhood of hard-
hats and begin preaching equal-
it_v. they‘re not going to listen. But
if I can organize them around
some issue like inflation. they
may find it to their benefit to
make a deal with blacks. Then.
maybe they'll all be able to com-

This basic organizational tech-
nique. so successful through the
years for Alinsky. has been modi-
fied to meet the changing Ameri-
can society. Alinsky finds it im-
possible today to concentrate sole-
ly on the organization of the poor.

 

CARL ALINSKY, inspirer of a chew-
ing-gum protest and teacher of Ce-
sar Chavez, spoke at the Urban Af-
fairs Conference here Friday night.

“We are the first nation to
emerge predominantly middle-
class, and this is where the pow-
er lies. Even if we were able to
put blacks, Puerto Ricans, Indi-
ans, all of the poor together, they
would still be in the minority. We
have to start organizing the mid-
dle class.”

One of the initial efforts at mid-
dle class organization was under-
taken by a graduate of Alinskys
Industrial Areas Foundation. Ce-
sar Chavez. “That grape boycott.
“reminds the proud instructor"
was essentially a middle-class ac-
tion."

Alinsky learned the methods of
agitating in the rough and tumble
arena of early unionization. when

brawn was employed more fre-
quently than subtlety. In that roll-
icking era. Alinsky found it neces-
sary to struggle for improbable
goals with the scrawniest of
means.

He is still fighting the odds.
Some years ago, several students
from an extremely conservative
university complained that their
social life was so restricted, that
gum chewing was the only per-
missible extra-curricular activ-
ity.

On Alinskys advice. each stu-
dent on campus threw wads and
wads of gum on the roads and
paths of the university. dramatiz-
ing their plight and effectively
halting transportation. At last re-
port. students at the university
were permitted to do anything.
save chew gum.

Alinsky has much less sympa-

thy with todays campus ridicals.
dismissing much of their philoso-
phy as "a lot of rhetoric.“

“When these kits speak out
against comfort and wealth, they
argue against the very things poor
people desire. It’s about time they
stopped copping out.”

Alinsky seldom does. though he
did manage to squirm out of a
dinner engagement Friday night.
When he heard that William
Kunstler was also in town and at-
tending a cocktail party in Squir-
rel Hill. he asked his beleagured
chauffeur-for-the-day if they
couldn‘t go to the cocktail party.

When the chauffeur appeared
hesitant. Alinsky said. “Well just
tell ‘em my plane was late“ and
off they went to the party which
cost its guests $12.50 to attend.

feur‘s wife and an admirer who

Condon Discusses
°B()(Iyf Laiiguage’

Dr. William S. Condon. assistant professor of Human Communica-

tion at Western Psychiatric Institute. will discuss .\'on—Verbal Com-
munication Thursday at 7 p.m. in 120 CF.

"When a person speaks. his body moves according to what he is

saying. His tone. in turn. signifies what he is thinking." stated Dr.
Condon.
In order to interpret expressions. movements and changes in

tone. Dr. Condon will bring sound films of facial expressions and body
movements.

Condon feels his field is "new and startling.“ In fact. he is one of
the four or five people across the country doing intense research in the
field of non-verbal communication.

Condon became interested in his field, “lingusitic-kinesics,” dur-

ing the l950’s when he worked as an attendant at Western Psychiatric I 

Institute and the Veteran's Administration Hospital. His doctoral thesis

' in philosophy, entitled “The Synoptic Index of the Works of Sigmund

Freud,” was also based on his interest in the field of human behavior.
Condon was awarded a doctorate in philosophy at the I7niversity in

1962 and has done post-doctoral studies in linguistics at the Univer- 

sity of Chicago. .
As a non—teaching member of Western Psychiatric Institute. Con-

don is currently interested in relating empirical work with theory by . 

studying sound films on human behavior.

Cuerilln Movements

NIGI-l'l' srunams

ON WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, your Student Cabinet will introduce four
petitions for your consideration. These petitions will be presented at our “OPEN
HOUSE” in the Supper Room of the Student Union beginning at 7 p.m. This meet-
ing will represent the start of a massive drive for signatures in support of the
following:

1) A VOICE IN COURSE SELECTION—Each student in General Studies should
be able to inform departments, through a valid pre—registration system, of
their needs or desires for particular future courses.

2) MAJOR ADVISING—Each department or school which offers a major in
General Studies should provide an advisor for evening students. This advice
should be available to both declared majors and to students contemplating a
particular major. This new advising system would not be meant to replace
the present advising system. Instead, it shouldrelieve some of the pressure
from our present overworked and understaffed advising section.

2) GRADING OPTIONS—All other undergraduates in this University have a %
choice in grading systems except General Studies students. We feel that night
students should have either the pass/ fail or credit/no entry options as soon
as possible.

4) A SHARE IN DECISION MAKING—The School of General Studies Council
which is composed of faculty, students, and administrators should be the
legitimate decision-making body of the school. In order to be effective, this
group must meet on a regular basis. We ask your support in calling for reg-
ular meetings.

THESE FOUR ISSUES, by no means, exhaust the possibilities for improving the

a night students lot. They are just more easily solved than major questions such
as the nature of the school’s responsibility to the community, but that question
will be raised in a future ad in The Pitt News. Meanwhile, come to the “Open
House” on November 18 and be one of the first, of what we hope will be many,
signers of the “Four Petitions.”

LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION in future ads. Remember, that’s No-
vember l8, Supper Room, Student Union, 7-11 :30 p.m.

Wearing their marine green
jackets, the Miami University
football team walked along Penn
Avenue, downtown Friday eve-
ning. Jokingly, the Hurricane
players began to shout and march
in cadence as though they were a
smooth-running Army unit.

The next day at Pitt Stadium the
Hurricanes didn‘t look like a
smooth-running football team for
almost two quarters against the
Panthers. And the Miami squad
couldn’t over come the careless-
ness.

The Hurricanes gave the foot-
ball to the Panthers six times in
the first two periods of the game
—five consecutive times at the
beginning of the second quarter.

The Panthers capitalized on
three of the breaks and quickly
produced a four-touchdown lead
with 38 minutes, 17’ seconds
still remaining in the game. Mi-
ami couldn't come back.

The Hurricanes ironically be-
gan to turn the game around
slightly on an interception of their
own. Burgess Owens got in the
way of a Dave Havern-to-Bill Pil-
conis pass and started the Hurri-
canes on a touchdown drive Mi-

the half was over.

Miami's Coach Walt Kichefski
called the Hurricane second half
their best half of the year, but
they only managed six of the 17
points required to overcome the
early deficit.

Kichefski said afterward, how-
ever, that he didn’t think his team
gave the game to the Panthers.

“We fumbled because Pitt hit
so hard," he reasoned. “They just
knocked the ball loose.

The ball was also away from
the hands of Miami receivers in
the game. Besides two early in-
terceptions, Pitt defenders ob-
tained two second-half steals.

Reggie Frye led the Pitt inter-
ceptors with two grabs, and now
leads the team with four this fall.
And, just in case Miami quarter-
back Kelly Cochrane would like to

know, Frye is one of those rarities .

in college football known as a
walk-on.

Reggie Frye, the man who act-
ed as thief and led Pitt with six
individual tackles and six assist-
ing knock-downs. is not receiving
an athletic scholarship for his Sat-
urday afternoon's work. He‘ll get
little more than the game ball he
earned against Miami.

But he’s not upset. or even frus-
trated. He is attending Pitt with a
University scholarship and he did-
nt expect to play often this year.

‘‘I was looking towards the fu-
ture, my junior and senior years,”
the sophomore said Saturday, af-
ter completing his second game
as a varsity starter. “I didn't

fense completely devastating.

noon than the Panthers. with 196
of them via the pass.

In fact, the Pitt defenders would
have been the in famous “goats."
instead of the heroes, if Coch-
rane hadn’t overthrown a couple
times when Hurricane receivers
were beating the Panther defen-
ders. Such plays have been fre-
quent this year, despite the suc-
cessful fall the Pitt defense
against the pass has had. And one
wonders if perhaps the Pitt sec-
ondary is a lucky secondary.

“Yeah, I guess so,” Frye said,
hesitatingly. “But you know the
quarterbacks couldn’t throw a
perfect pass every time.”

Yes. Reggie. And Walt Kichef-
ski will tell you that a team can't
be smooth-running every time.

  Panthers Hang On For Fifth Win 
      Cats First Half TDS 5’,

Outlast Miami ’Canesii,f

by JERRY MYERS : _ _
Extending their winning streak to five games in a row, the Pitt

Panthers victimized a mistake-prone Miami squad. 28-17. outlasting 

a Hurricane comeback attempt that finally sputtered late in the final_ _.

half.

Exploding for four touchdowns early in the first half. the Cats‘capi- \
talized on early miscues by Miami. The Hurricanes gave the ball up,‘-

eight times. four on fumbles and four on interceptions. Miami's failure _

to mount a sustained drive when they did hold onto the ball thus enabled
the Panthers to pile up 28 points early in the game. A y 7 V y -A

Size played an important part in the game, and the fact that Miami‘ ' V‘
was bigger than Pitt helped snuff out the Panther running attack. Work-”_»

ing from deep in their own terri-
tory for almost the entire second
half. the Cats failed to put any
points on the scoreboard during
the final 30 minutes of the contest.

 Ralph Cindrich 
Under Knife

Ralph Cindrich was sched-
uled for an ankle operation to-
day. Bone chips were to be re-
moved, and the surgery means
that the Panther middle line-
boclter will miss two or three
of the Panthers’ remaining four
games. His pre-season hopes
for All-America honors are, of
course, wiped out by his physi-
cal problems.

  

 

Miami, on the other hand, began
to move the ball late in the second
quarter, scoring with 7:37 left
in the half. Mike Cummins booted
a field goal with only 26 seconds
left in that half.

The Pitt machine started roll-
ing early in the game. Taking a
Miami punt at the Pitt 40. the Pan-
thers marched 60 yards in five
plays. highlighted by a 38-yard
pass from tailback Denny Ferris
to Steve Moyer and quarterback
Dave Havern threw a touchdown
pass to Esposito for the first Pitt
score.

The Cats got the ball right back
when Bill Ramos picked off a Kel-
ly Cochrane pass on Miami's first
play from scrimmage after Pitt's
TD. The Panthers then proceeded
to grind out 43 yards in seven
plays with Dave Garnett sliding
over right guard for the 11 yard
TD run.

Denny Ferris got his part of the
first half action with a six-yard
touchdown run which hiked the
Panther lead to 21-0. Ferris then
took a 21-yard pass from Havern

LEO BEMIS
Concerned Over Lekoma

 

 To JV-ers

" The junior varsity soccer team
/finished a very successful season
Saturday with a 3-0 whitewash
against the highly rated Cleveland
,5 State JV soccer team.

Scoring for the cub kickers
“were Rich Losego. Tony Bolea and
Jorge Maurer. The defensive
. alignment of Frank Resciniti. Jan
Korman and Bill Haines helped
V team captian and goalie George

Hull get his first shutout of the
season. George only gave up five
goals in the five games he played
 this year.

The junior team booters finish-
. ed with a record of 5-1-1. Coach

Dick Slutzky. who also coaches
,-wrestling. cited the players as
main reason for the team‘s suc-
.cess: “The guys made me look
_i good. They were excellent."

The team's explosive offense
scored 46 goals while the stingy
defense allowed only eight in sev-
', en contests. Leading scorer on the
"’sq‘uad was if Jorge Gutierrez who
had 12 markers. Other high
I scorers on the team were Tony
Bolea and Jorge Maurer with
eight goals apiece.

. With talent such as was seen on
the JV team this year. varsity
"scoach Leo Bemis should be able
J to adequately fill some of the holes
*on his varsity squad which was
4 unable to score Saturday.

 Booters Stung 

by MIKE MILLER

Horace Greely once advised
young men to "Go West." but the
young men of the Pitt soccer team
may be questioning this advice.
They lost their second match to
an Ohio team Saturday. bowing
2-0 to the Cleveland State Vik-
ings in a match at Cleveland State.

Coach Leo Bemis attributed the
loss -to the lack of scoring in the
first half of the match.

The Vikings were hobbled by in-
juries from a rugged match with
Kent State and were not playing
up to their full potential. Conse-
quently they missed some scor-
ing opportunities. The Pitt boot-
ers also did not take full advan-
tage of the opportunities.

This, felt Bemis, was the teams
undoing.

Cleveland‘s goals came back-to-
back in the closing minutes of the
second period.

Eraldo Mattei scored for the
Vikings on an assist by Jim Mc-
Millen with 19:36 gone in the sec-
ond period. Herman Szeker fol-
lowed him. netting a goal in 20:44
on an assist by Vito Colonna.

Coach Bemis was impressed by
the Viking offense.

"I thought the offense was as

 

 

good as Akrons.“ said Bemis. re-
ferring to the booter's first and
most challenging opponent. "They
have a good forward line. good
dribblers and good set up men."

Bemis. however. had little re-
gard for Cleveland's defense and
thought that Pitt should have got-
ten into the scoring.

One of Pitt’s shots passed over
thecrossbar of the goal cage and
rolled down the back of the net.
From the side lines it appeared
to have been a goal, and the ball
passed through a hole in the net.
The shot aroused hopes momen-
tarily. Bemis stated that if it had
been a score, the team might have
been able to recover and possi-
bly win.

Bemis maintained a 4-2-4 de-
fense throughout the match. des-
pite the burst of scoring in the
second half. He considered the de-
fense to be the most appropriate
against a strong forward line.
such as Clevelands. The goals
were not due to‘ the type of defen-
sive formation. -

. On the offense the booters tried
to score from the wing positions

.as the outside men were able to

out—run the enemy full" backs.
Their opponents utilized the same
strategy with more success.

A Runners Attend

I’itt Mermaids Lose To

   

ﬂ ‘Top’ Kent St., 65-30  

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Pitt's women's varsity swim
was_handed its second defeat on
Saturday by Kent State. 65-30.

Though not indicated by the
score. Pitt faired surprisingly
well against Kent State. a team
now in contention for the Ohio As-
sociation Championship.

The Pitt Mermaids again swam
well. all bettering their swimming
records from the last meet at
Slippery Rock. Kittan Martan
broke the Pitt record in freestyle.
when she came in at 28.4 in the
50 yard freestyle event. This time
was five tenths of a second better
than her prior record.

Captain Diane Kase came in
second for Pitt with a l:l4.6 time
in the 100 yard individual medley
‘event. Diane swam against Kent
State’s Kathy McKitrich who is
ranked fifth in the world in free-
style and who is trying-out for the
Olympics in 1972. Kathy McKit-
rich also led Kent State to first
place in the 200 yard medley and

was first in the 50 yard “free”
with a 25.2 time.

Diane also finished first for
Pitt in the 50 yard breaststroke
event. with a time of 35.0. Kent

, Pigs Outlnst Bombers

In illutldy Conditions
In Independent Action

by MARK SIGMON -

The football field was a swamp. but neither team seemed to care
as the Pigs held on to edge Bino's Bombers. 19-12. in an independent

league game on Thursday night.

On the fifth play of the contest. Pig quarterback John Fahnestock
dropped back and unleased a 50-yard scoring aerial to split end Larry
Stawartz. the latter having intercepted a Tony Bradjic pass just min-
utes before. Leading 6-0. the Pigs missed the PAT try. but still carried
their six point advantage into the second half.

At halftime. both squads es-
poused a great deal of confidence
and enthusiasm. “Bino“ Scairdo-
lari proclaimed. "If our iBomb-
ersi defense holds them scoreless
in the second half. well beat the
Pigs. It took the entire first half
for our offense to get adusted.
Now we are ready to roll."

The Bombers did indeed surge
in the second half, skyrocketing
to two touchdowns. But the Pigs
scored two touchdowns also, and
even added a successful PAT, as
Chuck Sietum grabbed Fahnes-
stock's conversion pass.

Bob White. the Pig coach and
two-wa_v starter. was cert,ainl_\' a
better seer than "Bino." pro-
phesizing between halves. "We'll
»Pigsi get two touchdowns this
half. despite these lousy playing
conditions.”

Old Spit, Sty
I)erelick Wfin

The Sty defeated the Serbian
.\';-itionals. 18-13. Thursday scor-
ing 12 points in the first half on
touchdown receptions by Bob l’ry-
bar who caught two touchdown
passes and (lone tjiomore who
grabbed a third Tl) aerial.

The Hawks and the Derelicks
tied. 12-12. but the Derelicks
were declared the winner by the
referees because they gained
more yardage. Jim Turner and
(‘liarles Slcmenda scored for the
Hawks and Dave Krugh scored
both Derelick 'l‘Ds on passes from
his brother. Bob.

Old Spit won their second in
downing the Pack, 20-0.

\ Sunday at noon the lilectrical
lﬁngineers defeated a group of
Freshman lingineersf 13-0. The
Civil Engineers topped the indus-
trials. 6-4. and the Mechanicals
held the Chemicals to only six

..points winning-.14-6. . ’ 

l)ave Marrangoni kept the
Bombers in contention with sev-
eral sparkling plays in the second
half. Besides scoring'a TD on a
20 yard pass ‘ from Bradjic.
Marrangoni intercepted one Pig
pass and set up the only other
Bomber score with a long pass
reception.

However. by the timevScando-
lari hit paydirt with less than two
minutes to go, the Pigs had al-
ready clinched the game. White
gathered in a 40 yard TD pass
from Fahnestock, and Stawartz
streaked down the, sideline with
an interception for the final score
of the contest.

In a football game marked by
tough blocking and pinpoint pass-
ing. the Pigs‘ depth and pass de-
fense were the deciding factors.
Despite the miserable playing con-
ditions. both offensive squads
were much sharper in the second
half.

.\'evertheless. White argued. "If
the fraternities can play on the
AstroTurf' in Pitt Stadium. why
shoiildnt our league be able to do
likewise?”

In the 50 yard butterfly event,
Pitt came in second with Margie
Wallace's 33.6 time and third with
Gail Ditman’s 35.3. Pitt also did
well in the 100 yard breaststroke
event. Sally Brunson clocked 1:24
to place second and Anna Marie
Crella placed third for Pitt.

Sally Phillips gave Pitt a sur-
prising second place in the diving
event. Sally has only worked out
this past week. due to illness. Pitt
Coach Virginia Grindle was very
pleased with Sall_v‘s performance.
"Weve been hurting for a diver
and Sally really came through.
This will mean a lot in future
events."

Despite the loss. Coach Grindle
believes Pitt did very well against
powerhouse Kent State. "We rose
to meet the competition. but the
competition was top calibre. Sev-
eral of the Kent State swimmers
are national champions. Kent
State has quality as well as quan-
tltv. ‘-

“We knew it would be a rough’

meet at Kent State—they have the
power and the depth. But we went
for the individual events instead
of the total score, and the girls did
very well.”

"All the swimmers are better-
ing their times and I‘m looking
forward to getting our first vic-
tory on Thursday.“

Pitt. now 0-2. will go for that
first win when they meet Chat-
ham at Trees Pool on Thursday at
Tp.m.

 

 

The Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania marksmen. led by senior
star shooter Bob ‘Doverspike.
easily outshot the Pitt rifle team.
1.320-1.238 Friday. Leading Pitt
gunner was senior Bill Crooks
who shot a 259. Howie Ashbrook
was tops among the newcomers
with a 224.

Junior Bruce Barrett. the
teams secretar_v. blamed the loss
on "a lack of spirit. Some of the
guys don‘t 'come to practice and
then they expect to do well."

The team is also burdened by
the load placed on the seven re-
turning lettermen due to the lack
of new shooters on the team this
year. Only two freshmen shot in
