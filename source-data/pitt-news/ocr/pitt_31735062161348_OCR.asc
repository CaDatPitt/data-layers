Loyalty Oath Passage

Poses Future Problem,
Law Dean Predicts

By GENE WEINSTEIN
Staff Reporter

“Just what does the proposed Loyalty Oath Bill mean
to us here at the University?”

This is the question which Pitt faculty, administration,
and students alike are pondering in the wake of the recent
passage of the bill by the State Senate.

. In an interview with the News on Monday, Charles B.
Nutting, dean of the Law School, commented on the following
questions arising out of the controversy.

Q. “Why should the Loyalty Oath Bill, if passed, affect
Pitt and not other colleges in the area?” ‘

A. “It would require the oath before Oct. 1, 1951,
only from faculty members of colleges supported or par-
tially supported by the state.”

Q. “What does the oath itself consist of?”

A. “It is divided into two parts. The
signers must swear: I. To support the
Constitution of Pennsylvania and the
United States.

2. That they do not advocate violent
overthrowal of the government nor that
they are members or affiliates of any or-
ganization which advocates such over-
throwal. Refusal to take the oath or the
admission of being a subversive person
will result in dismissal.” '

Q. “Is the Communist Party speciﬁcally mentioned in
the proposed law?”

A. “As far as I know it is not. The deﬁnition of the
word subversion is rather vague.” ‘P ‘

Q. “What protection, if any, does the bill give to ac-
cused employees?”

A. “The bill allows private hearings before the At-
torney General—and ﬁnal appeal, if necessary, to the
Common Pleas Court of Dauphin County.”

Q. “For what purpose was the Loyalty‘ Oath proposed
and ultimately passed in the Senate?”

A. “I understand that advocates of the bill contend
that it is necessary to drive communism out of the col-
leges -and that this bill is the proper instrument for
achieving that end.”

Q. “Why, then, has so much sentiment arisenagainst
the measure?”

_ ‘A. “Those who oppose the bill agree with its ob-
jectives but deny that it is the proper way to solve the
problem.”

Q. “What speciﬁc arguments do Q

 

Oath Meets
Mixed  

Reactions

The news of the passage in
the State Senate of the con-

troversial Loyalty Oath Bill

has meet mixed responses
here at Pitt.

The Act, as it now stands, would
require the “oath” from faculty
members of all state supported in-
stitutions.

Backing the bill at Harrisburg
are the various veteran groups,
with the opposition stemming
mainly from educational circles.

Recent developments here are:

1. The Chancellor of the Uni-
versity, Dr. R. H. Fitzger-
ald, urged Monday, extend-
ed hearings at Harrisburg
as well as a full discussion
of the issues involved.

2. The Board of Deans unan-
imously a p p r o v e d the
Chancellor's statement.

3. Student Congress tabled a

motion condemning the
Oath.
4. The Pitt Chapter of the

American Association of
University Professors has
not yet taken an official
stand. ‘‘

They are, however, mimeo-
graphing copies of the bill for dis-
tribution to all faculty members.

The secretary of the local
chapter, William Tacey of the
speech department, summarized
the attitudes of many of the fac-
ulty who commented on the Bill.

Tacey said, “I am opposed

to the bill because it is a
threat to freedom of teaching.
The term, subversive person,
is so difficult to deﬁne that
conceivably any teacher might
be in danger of being called
subversive if he were quoted
out of context.”

Col. Holland L. Robb, head of
the Military Science Department,
expressed the opposite view.

“I see no objection,” declar-

Enrollment Figures

By DAVE WINTER
Campus Editor

Is 12 years of schooling enough to equip a student for
the world of today, since the 1951 graduating senior will be
offered many opportunities for immediate reward in busi-
ness, industry, or the military services? ’

“No!” say Pitt educators. “In these times college edu-”

cation is more necessary than ever. In all phases of our na-
tional life, stress is made on our obligation to encourage

intelligent young people to get as much educational train-

ing beyond high school as possible.” (For instance, new draft

regulations deferring top 75 per cent of students.)
Hundreds of outstanding seniors from 74 Tri—State high

schools will get a chance to de-.

cide their own answers to this
question this month. through a

new public relations project
which started yesterday.
Talk, Look, Listen

Each school has been invited to
select 10 to 15 student leaders who
will come to Pitt for an afternoon
to talk, look and listen. The aim
of this public relations project is
to give high school students a clear
picture of what college life could
be like for them at Pitt. Stanton
C. Crawford, dean of the College,
is general chairman for the proj-
ect.

Pitt’s student leaders and some
of the University faculty and ad-
ministrators will help visitors to
ﬁnd out what Pitt has to offer in

Policy Talks
Listed Here

This week five of Pitt’s na-
tionality rooms will be the scene
of the Brookings Institution semi-
nar on “Problems of U. S. Foreign
Policy.”

Announcement that arrange-
ments for the seminar have been
completed was made today by
Viers W. Adams, director of Ells-
worth Center, who, with Clinton
W. Longwill of the Brookings
staff, is executive secretary of the
conference. '

He said that the Czechoslovak,
German, Rumanian, Scottish, and
Norwegian classrooms will be used
by the various discussion groups
of the seminar which runs from
April 5 to 10.

In addition, 132 C1. will be used
for meetings of the seminar as a
whole. Classes scheduled for
these rooms will be held else-
where from April 5 to 10, the days
the seminar will be in session.

those who are against the bill

present to substantiate their
claims?”
A. “They say that since

communists have no respect
for the truth, they would sign
the oath. Furthermore, they
continue, the Commies might
even encourage passage of
the law as a means of weak-
ening our institutions through
an atmosphere of dissension.”

Q. “What ultimate result do the
opponents of the bill believe the
Oath -might hav.e?”

A. “They believe that be-
cause of the vagueness of cer-
tain of the terms, as well as
other features, that persons
may be penalized because of
unorthodox political views.”
Q. “If the Act is made law, is

it, Dean Nutting, completely ana-
l_a’gous to the much publicized sit-
‘nation at the University of Cali-
fornia?”

A. “No. In California the
Board of Regents demanded
the oath. Here the State will
insist upon it as a condition
of employment.”

Q. “What if the University
should decide not to ﬁre non-
signers?”

A. “The results of this are
not speciﬁcally mentioned in
the bill.”

CHICAGO, lLL.—(I.P.)—Rad-

-The results of an ever-increas-

ere recently by Raymond D.

.This has brought about some
‘unusual trends. Ten more notice-
"able effects of the abrupt turn-
[about are: (1) More companies

;ning engineers have increased at
‘least 10 per cent in the last six
irnonths: (3) No graduate is begin-

Draft Deferment Test Ruled

High scholastic standing is now the means by which?

Pitt’s draft—eligible students may continue their studies for

at least one more year.

In an order signed Saturday, March 31, President Tru-
man authorized the deferment of college students from the

draft either on the basis of a high
score on a nation-wide aptitude
test or high standing in their class.

The test score necessary for
deferment, to be set later by
Draft Director Lewis B. Her-
shey, has been estimated as
70 out of a possible 100 points.
Deferment by “required schol-
astic standing” will probably
include the upper half of the
present freshman class, the
upper two-thirds of students
now sophomores, and the up‘-
per three fourths of the pres-
ent junior class.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
said that he was “highly pleased”
with the program, calling it a
“splendid arrangement.”

Blanks Available in April
Local draft boards will have

application blanks and printed in-
structions for the tests, available.
about April 12.

Students deferred under the
plan will be classiﬁed by their
local boards as “Class II-A (S).”

ed the Colonel, “to the Loyal-
ty Oath because it offers a
method of demonstrating our
cooperative spirit and our
loyalty by taking such an
oath.”

Dave Rhodes, editor of the Pitt
Law Review had this to say: “To
any .person with positive subver-
sive inclinations, a loyalty oath
would constitute no eife’ctive'bar—
rier. While obviously failing in its
functions, it would establish an
unhealthy precedent in our edu-
cational system.”

All student leaders contact-
ed attacked the bill chiefly on
the grounds that (1) it would
imperil academic freedom and
(2) it would not work.

Job Future

The average is $290 to $310; (4)
Industry is seeking women engi-
neers for the ﬁrst time; (5) Any
engineering graduate can begin
work the day after graduation.
The other changes include: (6)
Engineers in sales work and serv-
ice operations in industry already
are beingchanneled into strictly
engineering functions; (7) On—the-
spot hiring is taking plac.e for the
ﬁrst time; (8) Research managers
and heads of engineering depart-
ments are accompanying person-
nel men who normally interview,

(9) Companies are willing to ac-

draft if they have not received
their first notice; and (10) Train-
ing/programs have been curtailed
and eliminated except in the larg-
est companies, and graduates are
being placed immediately in en-

At present tests are being com-
piled by the Educational Testing
Service of Princeton, N. J.‘ They
will be administered at about 1000
examination centers, including the
University of Pittsburgh, on May
26, June 16, and June 30 at no
cost to students.

Dr. George L. Fahey, director
of the University Testing Service,
will administer the test here.

Draft-eligible high school sen-
iors or others planning to enter
college will take‘ the test after
beginning their ﬁrst year of work.

- Technicians Needed

The purpose of this new defer-

ment plan is to make certain

the nation will have a flow of ed-

ucated and trained men, especially
scientists and other technicians.
General Hershey has quoted
military officials, who testiﬁed be-
fore Congress. “ ince we cannot
hope to match t e Iron Curtain
countries in manpower our advan-
tage lies in our superority in sci-
entiﬁc and technical know-how.”

As for the basis upon which
deferments will be made.
Hershey will ﬁx the aptitude
level, “to either increase or
diminish the number of stu-
dents in training, .as the na-
tional interest may require.”
The General has pointed out

that these deferments are not ex-
emptions xfrom military service;
men deferred now will be expect-
ed, to serve in the armed forces
at the completion of their college
work, or sooner if they do un-
satisfactory work or drop out of
school.

Pro Brings Med Center Cash, 

By LHEN

BAKER

Since Feb.‘ 11 he’s been occupied with raising the neces-
sary funds to ﬁnance Pitt’s new medical center. Mahony is
not scared by multi—million dollar estimates. He’s just come

here after raising $550,000 for a.

church in Rochester, New York,
and before that he raised»$2,00~0,-
000 for a Philadelphia hospital.

Mahony works for Ketchum,
Inc., an agency which hires itself
out to conduct fund raising cam-
paigns. In choosing Mahony to
handle Pitt’s campaign, the agency
selected a man who was familiar
with the.University.

Former Pitt Instructor

Starting as a ﬁnance instructor
in 1924 Mr. Mahony continued for
19 years on Pitt’s staff. He became
the Director of the Downtown Di-
vision (now the Late Afternoon
and Evening School) in 1931, and
the Director of the Erie Center in
1938.

Then he became associated with

Brigh tens

gineering work.

The placement picture began
changing last September. Between
Sept. 15 and Oct. 15 demands for
research, development, and design
personnel increased at a surpris-
ing rate, Meade said. “Between
Nov. 1 and Dec. 1' calls for pro-
duction men became‘ urgent, and
the entire thing has snowballed
ever since. There have been as
many inquiries recently for pro-
duction men as there were during
the entire period from Sept. 1 to
Dec. 15.” _

This is only the beginning, he
asserted .“It is certain that engi-
neering colleges cannot meet the
complete demands of industry at
the present time, and it appears

behind in the future._iActually, the
low point will not be reached until

After this job he entered profes-

“The difference between a pro-
fessional and a homemade cam-
paign,” said Mr. Mahony, “is that
the professional knows now much
to ask -for and produces an in-
tense and compact job.”

An individual, according to Mr.
Mahony, is never sure just how
much he is expected to gi_ve.‘De-
termining this is Mr.- Mahony’s
job. His second responsibility is
setting up a time table which.must
be followed. He believes that if a
campaign lags beyond its deadline,
it will never meet its goal.

His job, as he visualizes it, is
not to collect money, but consists
instead of four aspects. The tech-

Tea for 400

Staff Reporter

A The man who wrote Tea for
Two, has never been in the Com-
mons Room at 3:30 p.m. or his
song might have gone Tea for 400.

Willa and William Wright are
the people responsible for pre-
paring the 400'cups of tea that
are ‘served every week day in the

Commons Room.

A Mrs. Wright has been making
tea for Pitt students and faculty
for about eight years. Four years

. ago when more people started tak-

ing advantage of this “pause that
refreshes” her husband was hired

‘to help her. ‘

Men Like Tea

The Wrights have noticed that
lately more men are drinking tea.
“In the past most of the tea was
consumed by the women, but now
it’s about even,” said the soft-
spoken Mrs. Wright.

Pitt men enjoy Mrs. Wright’s
tea so much that they have been
asking her for the receipe. “They
say it’s better than their mother’s
tea,” she said.

, Mr. and Mrs. Wright have been
married for 34 years. Mrs. Wright
is a graduate of Kentucky State
College and has taught in the ele-
mentary schools in Kentucky. Her
husband is a former salesman.

She Can Cook, Too

Mrs. Wright’s tea is good, but so

is her cooking. According to Mr.

- Syphilis and Communism

A member of the Universityof Colorado faculty ‘was
-speaking at a luncheon recently. At the .end of his ad--
dress, a man rose from the audience and said,"‘Sir, I
understand they teach communism in the classes at the
University. Is that true?”

The faculty member replied, “Sir that is quite true.
We do teach communism in our classes. And in our medi-
cal school we teach syphillis. But we don’t advocate‘
either.” i

University of Colorado.

legislated lo yalt y

Two bills, one the ‘loyalty oath: bill already passed by
the Senate and theother a measure to set up a legislative
investigation of Pennsylvania schools to 'discover'if Com-

munist principles are being taught there, are currently be-
ing considered by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.

Loyal, intelligent educators all over the United States
have been ﬁghting this kind of legislation ever since it ap-
peared two years -ago in California, and now are faced with
it here in Pennsylvania, supposedly one of the most enlight-
ened states in the Union.

The educators who oppose these measures are not ﬁght-
ing for an abstract principle or for a colorful philosophic
theory. The monster government of Nazi ‘Germany came
into being through the same kind of misguided, fear-inspired
legislation, and while it may take longer, the same thing CAN
happen here. In our desperate ﬁght to keep Communism

* from our front door, we are in danger of allowing an equally

dangerous foeto develop in our own parlor.
. v . >1< >1: :1:

The issue is not a question of loyalty versus disloyalty;
indeed, that question hardly enters the picture. No Com-
munist is going to think twice about perjuring himself to
further the interests of Communism. The signing of an oath
is not going to prevent any Commu_nist many school from
remaining right where he is.

The real issues are of such magnitude as to defy an ade-
quate discussion of them by any one person, particularly a
student, within the limits of a column, or even an entire
newspaper. . “

Yet it is vital.that .every citizen (not just faculty and
students) understand the full import of these measures, since
they represent a drastic step toward the restriction of indiv-

‘ idual and collective freedom and are comparable to similar

measures already in practice in Communist countries /and

* * *

— . The only adequate means of fully considering all as-
pects of the bills is the public hearing that has been demand-
ed of the legislature, and which the legislature has seen ﬁt
so far to deny. A

. They have done this in spite of the ‘fact that the right of
the citizen to hear and be heard on matters of public in-
terest constitutes the basic foundation of the system of rep-
resentative government.

A public hearing,‘ reported by the press, will let the or‘-
dinary citizen, as well as the legislators, see that something

' more than loyalty is involved. And it may throw a roadblock

across the downhill trail toward an American police state.

What can have caused all this interest? It is too early
for wrestling, and the Kefauver Committee has wound up its

more dramatic scene about to be
unlocked for TV audiences.
It is the grand opening of Chan-

Knowledge Revealed

As the class continues, there are
no nodding heads, no doodlers. Ev-
ery hand is held high with each
question, and every answer when
given has deep, sincere thought be-
hind it. There‘ is no hesitation
throughout the hour, and when
the bell has rung and the brisk

thoroughly and completely cov-
ered. _

E a ch listening housewife
feels she has stepped fore-
ward on the pathway to
knowledge, and the grand
debut of Channel 13, Pitts-
burgh, has successfully
launched a popular station

, Of course the scene above would
not be typical, either of the kind
of show used for Channel 13, or of
an 8:30 a.m. class at Pitt.

What programs are “education-

ference on Human Relations in Higher Education. _

graphed sheets on which the do-.
ings of the Conference are record-
ed for posterity. According to
Andy, the 300 odd delegates, from
some 20-0 colleges in 43 states, took
a healthy wallop at the problem of
getting along. in school. /‘

On the conference agenda were

in college admissions; unequal
medical and living facilities; un-
even participation in student ac-
tivities by underprivileged groups;
the effect of state legislation on
student affairs, and the problem
of training instructors. =-

Not Cowards

The delegates, all of whom rep-’
resented active student organiza-
tions on their respective campuses,
were no namby-pamby lot. «Un-
like most of ‘our courageous citi-
zens, they faced the “loyalty oath”
craze which is currently sweeping
the nation, and which has now
thrust up its ugly head in the great
state _of Pennsylvania.

The issue came up on the agenda
in the discussion of “faculty em-
ployment” practices. First, holding
that they were opposed to “dis-
crimination on the. basis of creed,

and a suitcase full of mimeo-9

such problems as discrimination.

religion, national origin, sex, or
political views in the hiring, ﬁring
and upgrading of faculty mem-

bers,” the delegates declared ﬁat-
ly: “Weare opposed to the use of
loyalty oaths for teachers.”

Later a resolution was pass-
ed by the Conference, sitting
as a committee of the whole,
which stated “Resolved, that‘
A the signing‘ of loyalty oaths
-not be used as criteria for

the hiring, ﬁring or upgrading

of faculty.”

The action of the Conference is
a heartening sign in these days of
blighted ignorance. It is also a
stinging rebuttal to those who
charge that American college stu-
dents are wallowing in amire of
dpathy on matters moral and po-
litical.

Go on. Jeer!

But there are, no doubt, many
who will shrug off the Conference
with the thought that here is just
another group of Reds, bent on
spreading their nefarious propa-
ganda and disrupting our beautiful
land of liberty. Not so, I say. A
brief glance at the organizations

represented at Earlham is suﬂi~§
cient to dispel this charge. .
There were representatives from‘

Although -Chuck Gibson
graduates from the freshman

-team to the Pitt varsity this

year, the sophomore basket-
ball backstop will still be per-
forming in the ‘min 0 r’

_ leagues.

Gibson has had more playing
experience than the average col-
lege ballplayer, having caught two
years for the.Dormont entry that
won the Greater Pittsburgh League
championship last summer.

The 20-year-old catcher makes
his collegiate debut Friday when
Pitt travels to Athens, Ohio, for
its season opener against Ohio

University.
* Pitt Booster

Chuck’s presence on Coach
Ralph Mitterling’s team should

solve the catching problem and
also give the mittmen a strong
booster for the coming season.
Gib is. high on the Panthers.

“If we don’t make the NCAA
with this year’s team,” Gib
charges, ‘.‘we never will. This is
our year to go to the tournament.”

Last season the Panthers needed
only "two victories against Penn
State to‘ gain a Section 2 NCAA
bid.

Starter for Dormont

Dormont was bigleague stuff
for the 5-8, 160-pound catcher.
Chuck held down a ﬁrst-string
berth along with ex-Pirate star,
Lee Handley, two ex-Double A
stars, Al Mackey and Ed Owcar,
and Bob Foliart. Foliart cpmpeted
against Phil Rizzuto for the New
,York Yankee shortstop position.

' During season competition, Gib
batted .275, but hit an even .500
during the playoffs.

The aggressive phys ed mask-
man could have jumped from Dor-
mont into professional baseball
but felt that his education was
more important.

said, “but I decided to combine

He’s quick to add, “I still want

graduation.”

Gib, a Saint George high grad-
uate, didn’t catch in high school
because baseball was absent from
the athletic program. Catching for
Pitt’s frosh squad last season, he
collected six hits for nine attempts
in four games.

Pitt Officials Frown
On Phog’/s Proposal

By WILL

DOERGE

News Sports Editor

The suggestion by Phog Allen, Kansas basketball coach,
that a national commissioner of athletics be appointed, isn’t
getting too muchsupport from Pitt’s athletic ofﬁcials.

Allen said in New York last week that college presi-

dents should surrender their po

wer to a national commission-

er who would receive $l00,000 yearly to regulate college

athletics. 7
But the opinion at Pitt to Allen’s —
plea seems to be—a commissioner
isn’t the answer.
Need for Law

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
doesn’t think the appointment of
a commissioner would be a good’
idea.

“Colleges ﬁrst have to agree on
what they want before anyone can
do anything for them,” Hamilton
told the Pitt News.

“We have need for the law,” he
continued, “but we seem to be go-
ing in reverse direction now thatf
the Sanity Code has been abol-Z
ished.” ~

Hamilton for Job? I
Earlier this month, Hamilton’s?
name had been mentioned as a’
good choice for a high commis-I
sioner of college athletics if the.
NCAA ever decided to create such 
a position. E
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgeraldi
had no comment to make on the?
proposed commissionership as he?
was not familiar with Allen’s pro- g
posals. I
“Captain Hamilton could prob-.
ably speak for me on the subject,” ’
the Chancellor did say. I
Not a Chance

Frank Carver, graduate man-

I

ager of athletics, backs up Ham-
ilton’s position. '

“I don’t think there is a chance
for a commissioner. This business
of regulating athletics is a matter
of self policing. When teams get

-out of line they have trouble get-

ting schedules.”

“One man can’t do the job of
policing college athletics,” con-
cludes Carver.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, basketball
coach, made this suggestion at the
recent coaches convention in an-
swer to Al‘en’s proposal.

Moron .'.\V3.I‘d
“I told them,” says Carlson,

. “that since our coaches association

‘s connected with education, we
should make an award each year
to the school which has an athlete
with an IQ of 60 to 70 who does
exceptionally well in, his studies.
“The award would be for a
miraculous educational job.”
Carlson feels that this would
show up the certain few schools
which are consistently involved in

lowering their educational stand-t

ards in order to ﬁeld top teams.
“I do not believe that Allen’s
suggestion for a commissioner is
the answer to our problem, be-
cause you can’t buy something for
$100,000,” Carlson maintains.

News Sports Editor
. Dr. H. C. Carlson, the Pitt basketball coach, and Sidney
. Brodson, the Milwaukee gambler, have arrived at the same

the fact—by different means,

however—that there are officials who are ‘homers’, that is
either consciously or uncon-

sciously.
Brodson came to his conclusion
through his betting activities,

.while Carlson bases his appraisal

of officials on the officiating re-
port which he submitted at the
recent coaches convention in Min-
neapolis.

His report merely backed up
what he had been maintaining for
a long time. Carlson always claim-
ed that there were ‘homers’ and
now he has the facts to substan-

‘tiate his beliefs.

“Our ‘officiating report has

cials who have consistently

Carlson.

During the past season, Carl-
son has kept tab on otﬁcials all
oiver the country by means of
charts which have been sent to
him by other coaches. Carlson is
the chairman of the officiating re-
search committee of the National

Association of Basketball Coach-

es.

Home Team Favored

‘ The returns he has received
have indicated that (1) the home
team is generally favored in foul
calling, especially in the second
half, (2) the home team is gener-
ally favored on out of bounds

’not call the two shot intentional

foul, unless the foul is on an at-
tempted shot. “

In the first game, Kappa Nu
will play the Phi Eps, and in the
second game. Kappa Nu will meet
Theta Chi to end regular season
play.

With both‘ Kappa Nu and the

three way tie for first place could
easily result. ‘-

Playoff Possible

”If Kappa Nu beats the Phi Eps
and then loses to Theta Chi, a
playoff would be necessary, and
would push the IM tournament
back until next week.

Director Leo Bemis plans to start
tourney action this Friday.
While the race for fraternity
points is not quite so close in Sec-
tion .2, two well-placed upsets
could result in a four-way tie for
first place.

be tied for the league lead,

Bemis has arranged the All-

possible for the fraternities to cop

What can be done to the offi-

the result that they’ll get few-

4 Up to Districts

Carlson is hoping that the vari-

_ ous NCAA districts will take ac-

tion in this oﬂiciating matter now
that his report has given them the
facts to work on.

His report shows that in Dis-
trict 2 which includes Pennsylva-
nia, New York, and West Vir-
ginia, visiting teams get a better
break from officials on foul call-
ing than in any of the NCAA’s
seven other districts.

Approximately the same num-
ber of fouls are called on both the

However, discusion on other
contemplated changes has result-
ed in experimental rules in sev-
eral of the conferences, and if
proved satisfactory, may be adopt-
ed nationally.

Games in the Big Seven con‘-
ference will be played under the
experimental rule that prohibits
the waiving of the free throw.
If the toss is made, the team
shooting will retain the ball, but
if the shot is missed, the ball will
continue in play.

In the Paciﬁc Coast conference,
the waiving of the free throw will
also be prohibited and all per-

The aim of rules such as'these
is to increase the penalty for a

“After a fash-

says Casanova,
“but we’ll know

President Howard Greenberger brought up the question

its With Oath
Staff Reporter

In one of its busiest sessions of the season, Student Con-
gress came to no decision on the currently hot loyalty oath

 

in his report at the start of theé
meeting, with the suggestion that
a motion one way or another on
the matter would be in order.

Nobody took him up on it until
the end of the meeting, when
Andy Schurman introduced a mo-
tion which would have put SC on
record as opposed to the loyalty
oath as a criterion for the hiring
and ﬁring of teachers and profes-
sors. .

Motion Tabled

Advisor Lester G. Brailey sug-
gested that it was then too late
in the meeting to begin discussion
on such a vital issue, and that it
would be a good idea to table the
motion until next week.

The lawmakers agreed anani-
mously to follow his suggestion.

Earlier in the session Herman
Levy had reported that he had
done about all he could do in the
way of getting the ‘servicemen’s
newsletter’ project organized.

He asked that SC decide
whether it wanted to continue to
administer the newsletter itself,
or whether the editor should be
a non-congressman.

Congressman Editor

A motion was made that some-
one out of Congress be appointed
as editor, but that one congress-
man be a.ppointed to act in an ad-
visory capacity. The motion pass-
ed, but President Greenberger put
off the appointments until a later
date.

Treasurer Bill Green then
moved that, if the money could be
found, SC buy a public address
system which would be used for
pep rallies, etc. The motion passed
unanimously, "and Green was in-
structed to begin scraping up the

necessary funds.

In a separate report, Green
drew a somewhat gloomy picture
of the present status of the pro-
posed inter-honorary fraternity
council. He said that the various
fraternities have thus far been un-
able to agree on any of the pro-
posals concerning the set-up of the
council which he has offered.

One More Try

Green said, however, that he is
going to give it “one more try,”
this time in the form of a steering
committee headed by Dean of
Men T. W. Biddle. The committee
will attempt to formulate a plan
on which at least some of the frats
can agree.,

So far Green says that a nucleus
group of eight or ten of the frats
could be formed as a starter.

Actors, Singers, Dancers

Players Seek Talent for Show

By IRENE ROZAKIS
Staﬁ‘ Reporter

Are you the type of person who comes home from a
movie and spends the rest of the evening acting out Clark
Gable’s part in front of your mirror?

Well, you don’t have to keep your talent hidden any
longer; here's your chance to be a real live actor.

Pitt Players will hold tryouts¢

this week for their next show,
Gold in the Hills; or The Dead
Sister’s Secret, a musical melo-
drama complete with strapping
hero, innocent heroine, and hissing
villain.
Cast of Thousands

Thirty—ﬁve actors and an un-
limited number or’ dancers, sing-
ers, specialty acts, and comedy
rountines will be needed.

The Players don’t care if you’re
a Pre-med, a Bus. Ad, sophomore,
senior, sorority girl or frat man.
Any student in the university is
eligible to try out.

Instead of conﬁning your har-

monizing to aan obscure corner,
bring that barbershop quartette to
the tryouts. Don’t waste that good
baritone or soprano singing Old
Man River in the shower; come up
and sing for Players.
Get Into the Act

And to all future Milton Berles,
why entertain the elevator pas-
sengers with your jokes? Make
them pay for their entertainment;
get into the Player’s next show.

The schedule for tryouts is as
follows:

Today—Actors only: 3:30-5:30
p.m. in 351 CI.

Tomorrow—Dancers only: 4 to

him to colleges and universities
throughout this district.

Due Friday

Pitt’s fraternity cow-boys and
sorority prairie gals have already

an annual part of the Spring Fes-

idea of a wild west show.

Each ﬂoat will be docorated to
represent a western song. Six cups
will be awarded, three to the best
fraternity ﬂoats and three to the
best sorority ﬂoats.
