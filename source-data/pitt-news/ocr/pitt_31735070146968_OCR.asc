instein’s ‘grandson’ wins award

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staff Writer

Ezra “Ted” N ewman’s father want-
ed his son to be a dentist. Ezra had
a different plan in mind.

Instead, he chose galaxies over
gumlines, a choice that was re-
warded last November when he
was granted the Einstein Prize
by the American Physical Soci-
ety. The award recognized the re-
tired Pitt professor for his lifetime
achievement in the scientiﬁc ﬁeld
of general relativity —— a domain
of study founded by Albert Ein-
stein.

“It’s the most signiﬁcant award
within the ﬁeld of gravity,” said
Jorge Pullin, chairman of the prize
selection committee.

Pullin said the choice to pres-
ent Newman the award was quick
and nearly urianimous, a rarity for
the Einstein Prize. He accounts
the swift selection to the major
contributions Newman has made
to the science.

In a statement, the American

Physical Society pointed to New-

1“

man s outstanding contributions
to theoretical relativity, including
the Newman—Penrose formalism,

Kerr-Newman solution, Heaven, V

and null foliation theory” as rea-
sons for his selection.

‘The society also commended
Newman for his “intellectual
passion, generosity and honesty,
which have inspired and repre-
sented a model for generations
of relativists.”

The most well—known of these
cited contributions was a math-
ematical discovery Newman un-
covered with Roger Penrose of
the University of Oxford in 1962.
The physicists found that they
could rewrite Einstein’s original

 

 

 

 

equations for general relativity
in a way that madethem easier
to analyze and solve under special

circumstances.

This new process of writing
the original equations is now
known as the Newman-Penrose
formalism and is used by physi-
cists across the world, said New-
man’s research partner and recent
Pitt graduate Tim Adamo.

ity knows about the Newman—Pen-
rose formalism,” Adamo said.

_ After his research with for-
malism, Newman continued to
contribute to the physics com-
munity. In 1965, he published re-
search at the same time as fellow
physicist Roy Kerr, predicting the
existence of a type ofblack hole,
one of only three types known to
potentially exist through math-
ematical deduction. This black

g hole type came to be known as the

Kerr-Newman black hole.
“Treasure troves of informa-
tion are hidden in those equa-

« tions,” Newman said.

Newman said that his expan-
sive work in general relativity
stems from his love for the sub-
ject. He knew from the time of
his high school days in New York
that he wished to pursue a career
in physics. His love of science led

battles
for (3-20 
records  

Andrew Bergman
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Citizen Police Review
Board is still embroiled in alegal ﬁght
for disclosure of police records from
last year’s G—20 Summit.

The CPRB, an investigative entity
formed in 1997 by a voter referen-
dum, was established to advise the
mayor and the chiefof police on police
conduct and to-hear and investigate
individual complaints pertaining to
police behavior. ‘ '

A recent court decision denied

the board access tofullpolice records
from the Summit. Beth Pittinger, the
board’s executive director, said these
records are necessary for a thorough
investigation of police conduct.

T Some of the documents the board
seeks —- like arrest reports — are
normally considered public records.

“Absent the police reports, we
can’t conduct a thorough investiga-
tion,” Pittinger said.

The city has maintained in court
documents that Pennsy1vania’s Crimi-
nal History Record Information Act,
which prevents disclosure of infor-

mation about suspects and criminal

records to non—criminal-justice agen-
cies, is a reasonable justiﬁcation for
reﬁising disclosure of police conduct
records.

Though the Citizen Police Review .

Board is considered bythe lawanon-
criminal-justice agency, its members
are appealing to the state Common-
wealth Court to force disclosure.

SGB denies morethan $20K

A Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staff Writer

Student Government Board allotted less than
one third of the $27,000 in allocations requests
it reviewed during last night’s meeting.

The Board denied many ofthe requests based
on precedent. Duringthe one hour anAd15 minute
meeting, the Board struggled-speciﬁcallywithtwo
large requests that totaled more than $15,000.

The ﬁrst was a request for the student orga-
nization Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee

Growth and Empowerment, known as FORGE. A

FORGE, whose purpose is to advocate-for

Areﬁigees and the poor, put on an on—campus con-

ference in 2008. The‘ organization nowwants to
host afollow-up conference at Pitt and requested

$5,281.77 to ﬁmd a two-day conference with a '

keynote speaker and two additional speakers’.
Historically, the Allocations Committee has

not recommended allocations for on-campus

conferences because those requests are not in

line with the Student Activities ﬁmd, said Matt '

Grau, allocations committee chairman.

The Board approved funds for one keynote
speaker after President Charlie Shull said the
event could be conside “on—campus program-
ming.” -

Board member and President-elect Molly

- Stieber encouraged the group to meet with her

to explore other sources of funding. -
The otherlarge request came from Lady Pan-
thers Lacrosse. The team requested $11,631.82to

attend atournament in'Calif' omia,' where the team‘ '

would compete with the top-10 ranked teams 

the nation. The group’s requestwas sent back to
the Allocations Committee for a second review.
‘ Captain Brittany Whiteside said the group
already had raised about $4,000 through ﬁmd-
raising. Grau suggested amending its request to
a lower amount and possibly raising team dues.
The last order ofbusinesswas to approve the
incoming Allocations chairman, Mike Bane.
Inaccordancewith SGB by-laws, anominating
committee chose the junior to lead the 2011-12
committee. _ M A

Duquesne University, said the city’s argumentfor

_ restricting access to the records is “interesting.”

He said that their attempt to use the Criminal
History Record Infom1ationAct to control public
dissemination information pertaining to police
conduct — as opposed to sensitive information
about investigations — isn’t necessarily in the

-normal spirit of the law.

Joanna Doven, a spokeswoman for Mayor
Luke Ravenstahl, did not respond to multiple
calls requesting comment.

Pittsburgh police spokeswoman Diane Rich-

ard directed all questions about the legal battle
to the Pittsburgh Law Department. Associate
city solicitorjohn Doherty referred back to the
Criminal History Record Information Act, say-

ing he believes the law prohibits the city from '
' releasing the documents. .

conduct during the G—20 Summit, the CPRB
opened up a general investigation into police
conduct during the Summit. The inquiry drew
about 88 separate comments expressing con-
cern about police conduct during the Summit,

AcLu suitscould disclose more

Pittinger said.

In March of this year, an initial court decision
ordered the city to disclose some police records.
The city then supplied 300 documents, some of
them heavily redacted. B

According to court documents, the board
asked a judge to consider the police department
and specifically Police Chief Nathan Harper for
contempt of court because the documents were
heavily redacted.

Outside of the courtroom, the -board has had
other issues with its investigation.

The board’s two solicitors, Hugh McGough
and William Ward, resigned after the city’s law
department tried to add a series of provisions
to their contracts. One provision mandated an
increase in malpractice insurance coverage and
another stipulated that the city could ﬁre attor-

. n‘eys without consulting the board, according ‘
to Pittinger. 

“The City Law Department is interfering
with the board’s right to hire a solicitor,” Pit-
tinger said. A ,

Currently the board has no lawyers.

Injune of this year, the mayor moved to re-
place ﬁve members of the board —— a move that

administration might be attempting to interfere
with the investigation. . t
The issue might soon be moot, as informa-
tion obtained bya series oflawsuits by individu-
als against the city could exceedwhat the board

has requested.

Two lawsuits in particular, Seeds of Peace

from New York University and a‘master’s
and" Ph.D. in the subject from Syracuse
University. '

It was at Syracuse that Newman con-
ducted work with physicist Peter Berg-
mann; Newman chose to attend Syracuse
because it would provide him the oppor-
tunity to study general relativity. ‘

Many scientists had abandoned general
relativitysoon after its discovery for the
fellow physics branch, quantum mechanics.
Bergmann, however,Ahad studied under Ein-

stein and was one of only a select number‘

“You could say [Newman] is the grand-
son ofEinstein, so to speak,” Pullin said.
Newman taught at Pitt beginning in
1956, when he took a post as an associate

. professor. Over the course of 40 years, he

taught a wide variety of classes in the ﬁelds
of physics and astronomy, mentoring 19
doctoral students along the way. He retired
from teaching in 1996 and now holds the
position of professor emeritus, conducting
research out of his ofﬁce in Allen Hall.
Newman, now 81, estimates that he
has written more than 30 papers since his
retirement. Currently, he is working on a

widely divergent perspectives.

At Pitt, the administration’s posi-
tion is clear. Although current laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
would theoretically permit concealed
carry at institutions like Pitt, Student
Code of Conduct deﬁnes possession
of a ﬁrearm as “an offense related to
welfare, health or safety.” Therefore,
while 71 U.S. college campuses — out
ofthousands — allow students or affili-
atestolegallycarty guns, accordingto
KXAN—TV, Pitt explicitly doesn’t.—

AtThe Pitt News, it’s more diﬂicult
to solidly come down one way or the
other. Whereas guns on campus might
provide certain people withextIafree-
dom and another sense of safety, con-
cealedcarrycould easily denythe same
rightsto otherstudents who choose not
to arm themselves.

We understand the need to feel
prepared—— as opposedto helpless ——'

- in the event of an imminent security

threat,butit,’s surelypossible that aver-

age students wielding guns duringsuch ,

a crisis couldjeopardize an organized
lockdown effort by uniformed secu-
rity personnel. Though SCCC’s claim
that of none of the 71 campusesthat
have endorsed concealed carty have
experienced gtmviolence mightbetrue,
sitting in lecture knowing that fellow
classmates could very well be packing
heat could substantially degrade the
overall learning environment. A

As we continue our never—ending
search for the best way to provide a

.violence-free campus community,

for institutions of higher education to
simply endorse concealed carrywould
not offer a complete solution, or even
come close for that matter. But since
more than 35 college campuses began
allowing concealed carry at the begin-
ningof this semester, it’s certainlytime
to talk about it. |

‘Potter’ best story ever

Bateman 4 6

came out, there’s a good chance We’re the
first pop—culture columnist to do this.
We’ve always prided ourselves on stay-
ing ahead of the trends, like that time we
coined the best—selling term “newsiness,”
and this retrospective is more of the same.
What We’re trying to say is that you’re lucky
to have us.

Okay, so ﬁrst question: Was Harry Pot-
ter the greatest story of any kind ever told
by anyone? Umm  yes in all capital let—
ters, as if we were shouting out the name
of England’s leading prog-rock quintet at
one of that band’s arena-shaking concerts.

And with three exclamation points. Until A
someone gets around to writing a rock '

opera using only text messaging —- an
idea that would surely revive the ﬂagging
careers of those aforementioned prog—rock

pioneers — this will probably remain the V

best story. _ .
We tried unceasingly to think of a bet-
ter story, perhaps one that involved those
ridiculous reality show and YouTube char—
acters you all love, but we were stumped.
However, since we believe in conducting

thorough research before we make any-.

bold claims, we challenge you to come up

with other stories that might top Harry.

uncomfortable the pie—humping scene in
that legendary hot college comedy was?
They wouldn’t have gone on to make 500
more of those ﬁlms if that nerdy, naive kid
wasn’t willing to thrust himself into that
warm apple pie. He did what he had to do,
and none of you will ever forget it.
By the same.logic, the Harry Potter se-
ries had to end the way that it did. Sure, it
, might have pleased a few holier-than-thou
types if the boy-wizard had stayed as pure
as the snow that fell right at the begin-
ning of Snowmageddon 2010, but that’s
not real life. Those of you who have been
out in the real world can understand the
pressures that Harry was facing. His mom
had a terminal illness, and his dad was
about to try a huge case against the evil

CEO of a petroleum corporationthat was. 
dumping oil as well as evil into the Gulf of

Mexico. This wasn’t the time for negotia-
tion, and we will go to our graves believing
that Harry did the right thing.
On top of this amazing ending, there
" was all of the great acting and great writing
that went into making the various Harry
Potter productions. We’ve always believed
that if you assign a great director to a mov-
ie and give him or her a great cast to work

 

Potter. Once you’ve got one, send us a let—
ter, and we’ll check your work for errors.

Next, let’s discuss the ending. How
about that ending? By way of “spoiler

' alert,” you should probably stop reading

right now if you haven’t seen Potter’s ﬁnal
act. It was a real lollapalooza of a bang fin-
ish, replete with all of the wit and the jokes
and the violence and the lovemaking that
has made this series such a family favorite.
Did we mention the wit and the jokes? Yep,
there certainly was a lot of that.

One of the wildest things that happened
at the end was Harry Potter’s decision to
lose his virginity so that he could save
the human race. It almost goes without
saying that this choice didn’t please folks
out in the Bible Belt. Those moral ma-
joritarians were already reeling after the
disgusting vampire pregnancy scene in
the last movie when the revelation about
the sexual orientation of the fancy—talking
actor who plays Harry’s adviser Gandalf
the Grey (later Gandalf the White) sent
them over the edge. If that weren’t bad
enough, Harry had to go and relinquish
his priceless maidenhead.

Nevertheless, you can’t compromise
when it comes to great art. Remember how

with, you can’t help but reap the beneﬁt
of such a great combination.j.K. Rowling,
A the lifeblood of Harry Potter, knew what
she was talking about when she hired these
folks. We doubt that any Academy Award
voters read our little column, but if they
do we want to exhort them to give Oscar
- statuettes to anyone who had anything to
do with the tragic story of this beautiful,
precocious and cherubic boy—wizard. ,
In short, we are all better people for
having lived through the greatest story
ever told. Consider the fantastical realms
through which we traveled: Narnia, Hog-
warts, the Matrix, outer space and Eng-
land. While following Harry’s miraculous

Did Judas Iscariot really betray Jesus?

The play ‘The Last Days of Judas Iscariot’ allows the audience to make its own judgment in Judas? court case in hell

Ryan McGinnis
Staff Writer

“Last Days ofJudas Iscariot”
Today through Sunday
Today—Saturday at 8 p.m. and
Saturday-Sunday matinees at
2 p.m.

Directed byjoanna Getting
Henry Heymann Theatre
www.play.pitt.edu

From the title alone, you might
think Stephen Adly Guirgis’ “The
Last Days of Judas Iscariot” is a
biblical drama about the well-
rehearsed New Testament story
ofJudas betrayingJesus. That the
play is in fact about a catatonic,
post-suicidalJudas standing trial
in hell probably wouldn’t occur
to you.

The premise gets stranger. A

The characters from “The Last Days ofJudas Iscariot” From left to right: Satan, Yousef

lawyer from purgatory has de-
cided to appealJudas’ damnation,
and Mother Teresa-, Sigmund
Freud, Satan and St. Monica are
present to weigh in on the case.

“College students are the per-
fect audience for this play,” said
Joanna Getting, the production’s
undergraduate director. “It’s
not about the Bible per se — it’s
about redemption, forgiveness,
not only of others but of yourself.

There’s something for everyone: _’

foul language, sexual innuendo,
Jesus.”

Guirgis intended the play to
have an irreverent surface and
serious themes simultaneously.

“The play appropriates Judeo—
Christian mythology and mod—
ernizes it,” said Brian Shaffer,
who plays Satan.

In essence, “Last Days” op-
poses itself to one-dimensional

representations ofJudas Iscariot,
treating‘ him instead as a com—
plicated ﬁgure whose role in
Christian tradition is anything
but settled.

“There are so many variations

on the story,” Getting said. “In
one of the Gnostic gospels for
example, it says Jesus tookJudas
under his wing and trusted him
to betray him, because his self-
sacriﬁce was necessary. In fact,
in my research I’ve found that

V some of the earlier New Testa-

ment translations don’t use the
verb ‘to betray’ to describejudas’
action — they say ‘Judas handed
overJesus.”’ =

The diverse assortment of wit-

 

nesses adds to the ambiguity.
“It’s actually Monica who nags
God to sign the writ and set the
trial in motion. As the mother
of St. Augustine, I think she sees
a lot of her son in Judas,” said
Maria Palombo, who plays St.

Dadija Bliudzius I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
El—Fayoumy, Judas Iscariot, Jesus of Nazareth

Monica. _

Palombo refers to Augustine’s"
lifestyle preconversion, when
he had a 13-year affair with a
Carthaginian woman. Though
many of his actions then were
sins by the doctrines he later
helped to shape,

Augustine’s biography is now
considered a model of the avail-
ability of forgiveness to most
Christian believers.

Of course, a central question
of “Last Days” is whether that
same forgiveness can be extend-
ed to Judas. ‘

Satan doesn’t think so.

“He’s testifying for the pros-
ecution, not the defense,” Get-
ting said. “Judas is Satan’s hood
ornament. He doesn’t want him
to leave hell.” \

As Satan, Schaffer added‘,

MUSIC COLUMN

Wagner: Rift between West and Swift not so big

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

Since the beginning of the modern
music industry, the actions of some
performers have overshadowed their
professional work. Kanye West might
be the perfect example of that today.

“Yo Taylor. I’m really happy for
you. I’mma let you ﬁnish, but Beyonce
had one ofthe bestvideos of all time.”
When West spoke those words to
country—pop artist Taylor Swift on the
stage of the-2009 MTV Video Music

Awards, he made himself Celebrity

Enemy No. 1.
At the time Iwas rather undecided
about both of artists. Kanye was cer-

, tainly every bit the egomaniac people

made him out to be, even before he

i proved it on stage. But Taylor Swift

also represented everything that

country music had become after

Nashville decided that being “coun- ‘
try” meant ﬁtting into a closely set ’

parameterthat doesn’t directly relate
to the genre’s rich musical past.

One year and one album each
later, West has proven_himselfto be
the victor in their implied feud. Not
only has West won over the critics, but
Swift seems to have taken a cue from
him — infusing her music with the
conventions of other genres.

In a move that quite literally made
my jaw drop, the popular indie music
site Pitchfork gave West’s ﬁrst post-

VMAalburn,MyBeauty'9¢/Dar,€ Tu/irted thatsoundandsignalthatswiltmight _

Fania.)/, a 10.0 rating. On atraditional iv

rating scale aperfect score might not

seemthathardto obtain, butonasite L

that caters primarily to indie-music
lovers and gives even what it consid-
ers to be the best albums of the year
grades as low as a 7 out of 10, the rat-
ing something to note._

The album really is that good.

From the super catchy chorus of

“Dark Fantasy” (“Can we get much
higher / so high”) through the sincere-
ly syncopated beat of “Runaway” and
ending with the politically charged
vocals of Gil Scott-Heron on “Who

I‘ Will Survive inAmerica,” it’s one ofthe

most inventive albums in hip-hop’s
recent memory. . I
Many note West’s ability to create
such work in spite of his controver-
sial statements. But it’s because he

says outlandish things that he can
give so much credence to songs like
“Runaway,” which features ahaunting
toast to everyone with a Kanye—style
big mouth. '
Separated by genre buttied byhis—
tory Taylor Swift released her third al-
bumSpea/(eNo22gamontl1beforeWest’s

hasalways beenamaster at'communi-
eating her personal feelings through
song, and thisxalbum is no exception.
Speak Nouis ﬁrst single, “Mine,” is a
sentimental ballad of young love in
Swiit’s traditional uber—sweet style.
Other tracks, however, diverge from

not be the country music industry’s
cash cow that she was made out to
be.

With every release, it feels like
Swiftis recording her growthas a per-
son and, on this release, part of that
is an evolution of sound. “Innocent,”
which she performed at the VMAs a
year after the incident with West -—
and might or might not have intended
to be about him —"is informed by a

heavy backbeat that seems straight __

out of hip—hop. The guitars move
toward rock rather than the twangy
honky-tonk that most country artists
seem to use by default '

The album’s second single, .“Back

to December,” leans even more heavily, .
. toward her changing sound. Whereas

her vocals seem to go places outside
of count1y’s usual croon, she’s backed

by Shondells-style guitar and a 

orchestra, adding an interesting tex-
ture to her already sentimental lyrics.
“You gave me all your love, and all I
gave you was goodbye,”. are the lyr-

ics as swellingstrings accentuate her »
*''’s‘e"lf5Ioathing,''and a chm”, 1'n“gﬁ‘é*mBl‘o'”

accentuates her pain.

Swift had always teetered on the
edge of pop. With this album’s evolu-
tion, she seems to be moving even
more rapidly toward diverse produc—
tion.’ 1

Though various musicians have

made concerted efforts to incorporate ‘

different influences into their work

‘ throughout human history, one of the

most prominent in today’s world is
none other than Kanye West.’
Performing on VH1 Storytellers
with a string section, listening pri-
marily to rock outside of his work
and maintaining a strong tie to hip-

I hop, West is the model for this style

of production.

It’s curious that alter Kanye’s re-
marks, Swiftmovedinadirection that

mans are allowed to go to heaven,
and he’s been cast out. I think he’s
come to a place where he’s ac-
cepted that, but others don’t see
that in him. There’s a point where
he says, ‘I don’t care about good
and bad; I care about truth.”’
No one has a definitive claim
to truth in “Last Days.” Getting

said the play doesn’t resolve with
one interpretation of the New
Testament trurnping the others
but rather provokes audiences
to consider the nature of truth
itself.

7 “A big theme in the play is the
difference between loyalty and
honesty,” Schaffer said. “When

you think about loyalty, maybe
you think about a dog or a soldier,
but there’s also loyalty to an idea.
And what is truth but loyalty to
an idea?”

One of the interests of “Last
Days” is its involvement of the
audience in the proceedings, in
thesense that the play’s open-

endedness and experimental pre-
sentation should trigger thought
in attendees.

“We want the audience to feel
like members of a jury,” Getting
said. ~

And of course, there’s the mis-
chievous reimagining of histori-
cal characters.

“St. Monica isn’t played like
you’d expect — she’s a badass
from Brooklyn,” Palombo said.

The play has added depth to
the cast and crew’s perception
ofjudas. "l

“I think audiences will find .

said. '

: MEN'S BASKETBALL

City Game still a major

-\

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ Writer

When considering the Pitt men’s
basketball team’s most intense ri-
vals, a few schools come to mind
— namely West Virginia and Con-

__, gr/iecticut, perhaps even Syracuse and
more recently Villanova.

But sometimes it’s easy to forget
about one of Pitt’s oldest rivalries: A
nonconference game —— although it
wasn’t‘always that way _— against
a school located only three miles
down the road on Forbes Avenue.

This year marks the 79th meet-
ing between Pitt and Duquesne in
what is known as the City Game, a
matchup that players and coaches
remember for its intensity.

_ “We’ve had some great games,”
Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said in
a news conference. “Rivalries are
great, because whatever happened
last year orthe previous «two years 
those things don’t matter. It’s a new
game, and everything’s forgotten.
And it’s who’s playing that night.”

The teams met for the ﬁrst time
in 1932, and the location of the City
Game has varied since its start. From
1932-39, the game was played in Pitt
Pavilion. When the series resumed

.5311 1953, it took place in Pitt’s new
home, the Fitzgerald Field House.

Starting in 1966, the Panthers
and the Dukes met in'Civic Arena,
also known as Mellon Arena, for
10 straight years. After the 1976
season, the City Game alternated

(between Mellon Arena and the two
schools’ home courts.

From 2002 until the City Game
last year, the matchup was played
either in Duquesne’s A.J. Palumbo
Center or the Petersen Events Center.

rstarting this year, the rivalry game
will take place on the Consol Energy
Center floor, where both schools
have their own locker rooms.

From 1976-82, Pitt and Duquesne
played in the same conference, the

1 Eastern Eight, made up of the two
‘ ﬁittsburgh schools as well as Vil-
lanova, West Virginia, Penn State,

George Washington, Massachusetts
and Rutgers. - '

This period created some of the
most intense games between the
Panthers and the Dukes. Former
Pitt point guard Kirk Bruce, who
played from 1971-75, just before Pitt
entered the Eastern Eight, remem-
bers why.

During that time, there was a V

freshman team and a varsity squad.

The rivalry with Duquesne, Bruce
said, started when the players were
freshmen‘, and he played against
some of the opposing athletes in
high school.

The rivalry was particularly
strong during Bruce’s time as a
Panther because Pitt assistant coach
Tim Grgurich and Duquesne assis-
tant coach Mike Rice both attended"
their respective schools and played

against each other in the 19605.

“For sure, our assistant coach in-
stilled in us the rivalry he had when
he was a player at Pitt,” Bruce said.
“I think the other reason why it was
so intense is that most of the play-
ers back then on both teams were
local.” 3

friends in the summer and played

THROWING A KIRSCH BALL

All Pitt fans shouldbe at Consol for City Game  

Last year, Duquesne students outnumbered-Pitt students at Mellon Arena — that shouldn’t happen

Lauren Kirschman
Staﬁ'Wri ter

 

Last year’s City Game was disap-

_ pointing. .

No, not because Duquesne took
Pitt to two overtimes. Actually, the
game was exciting —.although
stressful —. and the 17-point
comeback by the Panthers made
for the perfect ﬁnal college bas-
ketball game in Mellon Arena.

The City Game was disap-
pointing because the number of
Duquesne students in attendance
noticeably exceeded the number
of Pitt students in attendance.
Knowing that the attendance had
nothing to do with travel time, I
could guess the reason why.

When it comes to rivals,
Duquesne isn’t the ﬁrst school
that comes to mind for Pitt fans.
We remember the games against
Connecticut and West Virginia.

The double-overtime win last
year was more of a bother than
anything, an obstacle in the path
to Big East basketball.

To Duquesne, that’s not the

* case. The Panthers are the big

boys in town, and the other Pitts-
burgh schools are just dying to
knock them down a peg. Hence,
Duquesne students show up in full
force when the City Game rolls
around. . .

But here’s a little history les-
sonifor you: ;It wasn’t always that

But from 1966-78, the Dukes
won 10 out of the 12 matchups
with Pitt. From February 1980
through January 1982, the two

teams met six times. Duquesne

won four times.

After that, the Panthers start-
ed their dominance, winning the
next nine games against Duquesne
and then, after a loss in 1988, win-
ning the next seven. Pitt’s last loss
to the Dukes came in 2000, which

Last year, Duquesneicame pret-

won by 11 points; in 2007, they
won by ﬁve. So here’s something
to remember‘: Anything can hap-
pen in a rivalry game, especially
when you’re at the top.

What this all amounts to is

Maybe it won’t be as excitin
as playing West Virginia or Con-
necticut. Or maybe, like last year,
it -will. Either way, it’s a college
basketball game between two
Division I Pittsburgh basketball
teams. _

It’s a natural rivalry between

11

two universities located on the
same street; Pitt and Duquesne
players know each other and play
against each other in the Pitts-
burgh Pro—Am League during the
summer.

Not only that, but the game
will open up.Consol Energy Center
to basketball. If you missed the
last game in Mellon Arena, not
only did you miss a thriller, you
missed a historicalmoment. Don’t
miss another.

It’s probably seen as more of a
rivalry to older fans than college
students, and that’s okay. But it’s
still about bragging rights. For
the last nine years, Pitt has had
them. Why miss the chance to
use them because you’re sitting
in Oakland?

Pitt students are lucky enough
to be able to have the No. 3 basket-
ball team in the country.

other, so when college basketball
season rolled around, the City Game
was mostly about bragging rights.
“The funny part about it was that
we were_ friends off the court, but
when the game started, you had guys
trying to rip each other’s heads 0 ,”
Bruce said. A‘
All of the City Game matchups
were intense, Bruce said, and many
were close games. The two schools
played every year in a Christmas
tournament known as the Steel

‘ Bowl.

“Duquesne was Very good back
then,” Bruce said. “It meant some-
thing for us to try to strive and beat

. them.”

The matchup on Dec. 7, 1973 is
the game Bruce remembers most
fondly. The Panthers defeated
Duquesne 82-65 in a game where
former Pitt great Billy Knight scored
32 points. Pitt went on to put to-
gether a 25-4 season and advance
tothe NCAA Elite Eight.

“We beat them pretty bad,”

Bruce said. “That particular game

really propelled us to have a great '

season.” -
Bruce went 1-3 against the Duke
during his time as a Panther. Former

Pitt guard Curtis Aiken had more
luckfrom 1983-87, during which
time the Panthers won every game
against their crosstown rivals.

The matchup never lost its in-
tensity.

“I always remember feeling more '

nervous about that game than any
other game we played,” Aiken said.

i “We were favored every year when

Weiplayed against them, although
the score didn’t dictate that every
year.” -

_ , Pitt and Duquesne played close
games in both 1983 and 1984, when
the Panthers won by ﬁve and six
points, respectively.

Over the summer, Aiken said
players from both schools would
be geared up for the game and talk
trash back and forth. Although they
were all friends off the court, Aiken,

‘ like Bruce, said all affable feelings

disappeared when it wasptilme to

“The coaches made it intense,”

team will have to play well to win tonight.

“We look forward to the opportunity to
play against a very good basketball team
that is playing well,” Dixon said. “And we
look forward to the challenge.”

Duquesne is a quality shooting team
that Dixon compares to early season op~
ponent Rhode Island, who is also in the
Atlantic 10.

“I’ve seen [Duquesne] make shots. That’s
what they do,” he said. “That’s what they
did against us last year. That’s something
we have to prepare for. They can shoot the
ball.”

The Dukes could pose a problem for Pitt.
The Panthers struggled against a quality
shooting team like Rhode Island and didn’t
put them away until late.

If the Panthers can take care of business
this week starting with Duquesne tonight,
they could continue to rise in the polls.
Ohio State, ranked No. 2 in the nation, faced
tough competition last night and No. 1 Duke

will face a strong competitor tonight. I

Summer leagues lead
to bragging rights

History < 11

P - sure leading up to the City Game. In terms of

games the Panthers looked forward to, the
matchup with Duquesne was the top contest
circled on their calendars. '

“The fun part was when the ball went up
in the air, and you got to play the game,” he
said. “The pressure and the nerves leading up
to the game weren’t ﬁm.” — .

Beginning in the 1982-83 season, Pitt
joined the Big East Conference. Since then,
the Panthers have won 25 of 28 City Games,
including a record-tying nine in a row since
2001. Dixon remembers the loss to Duquesne
in 2000 “like it was yesterday.” Former guard
Julius Page missed a chance to tie the game on
a technical foul free throw.

Even with Pitt’s recent dominance, Aiken
said he doesn’t see much difference in the
rivalry he experienced andthe City Game
today. .

Kirk Bruce:-

Duquesne to ‘fcome out swinging,” in this
year’s version of the City Game, which marks
the ﬁrst basketball gamein the new Consol
Energy Center. - P

“They probably felt like they should have

’ won last year,” Wanamaker said. “We gave

them some chances.”

Senior Gilbert Brown agreed with Aiken
that the Pro—Am League helps to sustain the ri-
valry, saying that the league brings a new level
of passion and excitement to the game. When
Brown played his ﬁrst gameat Duquesne’s
Palumbo Center, he realized how important
the rivalry was to the fans.

“It was a crazy atmosphere,” he said. “The
place was packed.”

Dixon’ said that the game means a lot to
fans from both schools. In turn, he added that
the game means more to the players. The pro-
grams have done everything right in carrying

The similarities are that you have a
two teams that are basically located
on thegsarnestreet.  

Pitt and Duquesne players still face off
in the Pittsburgh Basketball C1ub’s Pro—Am
Summer League, he said, and the coaches and
players understand the signiﬁcance behind the
rivalry, making it as intense as it’s ever been.

“It was a great game last year, and I know
Duquesne felt like they should have won the
game,” Aiken said. “They’ll be looking for
some "revenge. It’s very intense and exciting.
If you’re a fan of basketball in Pittsburgh, you
don’t want to miss this game.”

Bruce believes much of the intensity now
stems from the fans.

“The similarities are that you have two
teams thatare basically located on the same
street,” he said. “That’s always goingto be
a natural thing. The difference now is [Pitt]
is ranked pretty high, and Duquesne is low-
er looking up. We want to continue being

a good team, and Duquesne is in the way a '

little bit.”

Last season, in the ﬁnal basketball game
inside Mellon Arena, Pitt clawed back from
a 17-point deﬁcit in the second half to force
overtime.

Ashton Gibbs hit a 3-pointer with 2:06 left
that sent the game to the ﬁrst overtime, but
the game stretched into a second overtime,
where the Panthers out-shot the Dukes 11-2
to secure the victory.

Pitt senior Brad Wanamaker expects

on the tradition, he said, from closing Mellon
Arena to opening Consol Energy Center with
the ‘City Game.

-Duquesne head coach Ron Everhart said
just having the chance to play the City Game
is a great opportunity for Duquesne, and he
praised the Pitt program. _

“They’re a very good basketball team and
ateam certainly capable of winning a national
championship,” he said. “Again, you look at
it as an opportunity in a sense to put up or
shut up. , _ V

“[The Panthers] are good, they’re real
good, and you just hope as a coach you can
make your guys understand that you have
to play as hard as you can for the entire 40
minutes to have a chance to compete against
guys like this.”

Dixon said that with the Pitt and Duquesne
teams, ‘as well as the recent resurgence of the
Robert Morris program, basketball is on the
rise in Pittsburgh. Playing the City ‘Game in
the Consol Energy Center will only help.the
rivalry to grow.

“It’s a special game for us,” he said. “I’m
glad the tradition continues, and I think we’ve
done everything right in moving [the City
Game to Consol].”

Pitt and Duquesne will tip-off in the Consol
Energy Center Wednesday at 9 p.m. Tickets
are still available. I A
