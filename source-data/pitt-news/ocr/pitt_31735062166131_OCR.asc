MC To Consider
Progress, Purpose
In Self-Evaluation

Men’s Council is now in the
process of arranging acorn-
mittee to evaluate objectively
the progress and function of
council. This is a follow up

of a proposal suggested at
the ﬁrst meeting of this year.
The chairman of the committee
will be selected from within MC,
but the general composition of
the committee is still in the plan-
ning state.

At the Council meeting Wed-
nesday, Nov. 7, Bob Barrickman,
Col. ’57, moved and council mem-
bers passed the motion that MC
sponsor a series of dancing lessons
at the new student union for the
whole student body and that a
committee be‘ appointed to ar-
range details for the smooth op-
eration of such a program. Bar-
rickman stated concerning the
coming dance lessons: “I feel that
this school, in its role as a great
University, should have students,
who are able to dance well. The
lessons, sponsored by Council, will
be free to the student body. MC
should offer to the students as
many services as it possibly can.
The series of ﬁve lessons, with
instructors most probably furnish-
ed by the Morgan Dancingschool
will be offered in the early after-
noon.”

Art Bloom, Bus. Ad. ’59, chair-
man of the social committee, pro-
posed to MC that they hold a so-
cial affair some weekend in the
near future. This will further
their objective on becoming a
more homogeneous group.

Jan Swensen, Col. ’59, will
edit a newsletter concerning the
activities and projects of , coun-
cil which will be sent to groups

Students To
Raise Funds

By GORDON CLOVVNEY

Pitt’ s Varsity M - thing
Band will represent the stu-
dent body at the Miami foot-
ball game on December 8th,
provided a student sponsored
drive can raise $8,000 to help
pay expenses.

The significance of the game,
which was originally scheduled for
Friday evening, December 7th,
was-not realized at the time the
band's biiclget was drawn up.
Therefore, no allocation was made
for the trip.

But since this time, the game
has been rescheduled for Saturday
afternoon, and will be televised
nationally as the TV gaine of the
week. Both Pitt and Miami have
high national ratings at this date,
and should each team continue
their winning ways the game
could produce a major bowl con-
testant.

Cost of the trip will be about
$12,000, a third of which the band
will be able to pay, leaving two
thirds, or $8,000 to be raised by
the student body.

Two fund raising projects will
be undertaken by Bob Richard-
son and Carol Vaganozzi, general
co-chairmen of the student drive.

The first effort to raise money
will be at the Pitt-Army game on
November 17th. Canisters will be
available for the contributions of
fans attending the game, It is

hoped that the second third of the 6

$12,00 goal can be collected that
day.

A beneﬁt concert by the band,
to be given at Cafnegie Music
Hall on November 30th, will be
the second of the two projects.
The concert is expected to -raise
the additional money needed, ap-
proximately $4,000.

It would be necessary for at
least 2,000 students to attend this
concert to make it successful, ac-
cording to T. W. Biddle, Dean of
Men. Dean Biddle pointed out that
in 1952, $2,800 was collected
through a direct solicitation cam-
paign to send the band to the
Notre Dame game at South Bend,
Indiana that year.

He pointed out that it would re-
quire another such enthusiastic
response on the part of students
to make this present drive click.

In emphasizing the fact that this
drive would be entirely a student
sponsored project, Dean ‘Biddle
stated that Student Congress is
willing to lend their support to
the success of the undertaking.

to the Dean of Men, will work

Fine» Arts.iGallery
To Present Exhibit
Of Poetry and Art

University of Pittsburgh Henry
Clay Frick Art Gallery is current-
ly showing an exhibition entitled
“Poetry and Art” on the seventh
floor Cl. This exhibition will con-
tinue through Nov. 21.

The main purpose of this ex-
hibition is to illustrate the cor-
relation of the work of the vari-
ous department in the humani-
ties and how each phase of ex-
pression enhances the other. The
Fine Arts Department also
states that this visual approach
may provide visitors to the gal-
lery with a new insight into the
subjects of poetry, painting or‘
philosophy.

Also on exhibition is a glazed
horse which was recently received
by Fine Arts through the will of
the late Henry King Siebeneck, a
Pittsburgh lawyer. This example
of Chinese sculpture and pottery
represents the work of the Tang
period (618 to 905 A.D.).

Recently the Philippines have

economic development. Jose San-

fact, prior to his arrival in the '
United States in June of this
year, Joe had already made quite
a name for’ himself in his native
country. A

His opportunity came only a V
short while after he had been ad-
mitted to the bar in 1955. At the
Nacionalist Party convention, he
was nominated for a seat in the
Palowan provincial assembly. Al-
though the Nacionalistas won a
decisive victory in the national
election, the Liberal Party swept
the provincial vote, thereby
affecting Jose's ﬁrst taste of poli-
tical defeat. In the interim be-
tween elections, this young poli-
tical aspirant decided to further
his understanding of economics —
and government by studying in an

It was from the United States
Information Bureau in Manila
that Jose ﬁrst heard of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s School of
Retailing. Although he had been
accepted to several American
universities, he chose Pitt after
a visit here this summer. While
here, he is supplementing his
book learning with actual ﬁeld

Guild Gains

Many of the nearly 300 freshman women have had scores
of activities behind their names in various high school year-
books. And once in college,‘ the former journal editors
and class play stars la.ment not having immediate scores of
similar “extra—activities.” Why not apply all. this loose tal-
ent? Why not try out for every possible club or activity?
Simple-——that would be leaping right out of the frying pan
into the ﬁre! A

» First of all, the matter of mid—term grades should be
considered. More than 1300 freshman men and women are
enrolled in various general courses. Classes are large, and
there is little or no time for personal instruction. Lectures
move fast, and often much can be missed even in an in-
stant’s distraction. Further burden of running to meetings
and preparing for programs would tend to pull down mid-
term grades. _ A e
, Secondly, much less work in college is speciﬁcally as-
signed than in high school.,Students may attend lectures
without having read the assigned pages and no one will mark
a red “E” in a roll book. ' , 4

The only way students know they’ve fulﬁlled an as-

signment is by their understanding the professor’s theory
or being able to count the red cells seen under a micro-

scope. H
Finally, there’s an easy ‘stepping stone into “the ﬁre”

L from,“the frying pan.” ‘This stepping stone, for the women

students, is a system of freshman clubs that work directly
with'campus activities. These eight clubs——called Guilds-—

A include a recreation group, a drama’ group, one on news-

paper work, nationality rooms, choral, twelfth ﬂoor, speech
and art. '
Besides working with the various campus groups, the
Guilds are an end in themselves. Plans are being‘ made
to produce a one act play, to swim at the YMHA, to sew
foreign costumes for dolls, to sing, to cook, to give a radio
program on WCAE, and to “dabble in paint.” . '
Beginning this freshman program for women, the Guild

“chairmen and advisors will hold an introduction party on

November 30 from 4-6 p.m. on the twelfth ﬂoor. Meetings

" twill continue acording to the free time of the freshmen.

(Mentor groups will disband). Sophomore women will aid

i the chairmen with meetings so that schedule conﬁicts will
-let freshmen belong to the activity of their ﬁrst choice.

A Activity in one of these Guilds is an introduction to only
one of the many phases of campus life. It is one of the
numerous bridges “from the frying pan into the ﬁre.”

 vs Technology  ._ _," ' 

And Everything   In Altos" Place 

By Jay Butler

Our expanding technology, clutchng at its slide .

rule with hot little ﬁsts and squinting at the world
through a fuming test-tube, has set for itself the
canon of admitting to the world of practical reality
only those phenomena which can be measured in
the laboratory or charted on a graph. Admirable
and effective as this method may be in. dealing
with electrons or rectilinear func-
tions or the mileage of the fam-
ily automobile, it tends to ex-
clude large areas of our culture
in the humanities and the arts.

Are we practically justified in
this exclusion? Has art become

in practical modern society? Though such a view.

may be sneered at by the cult of the micrometer

and the brotherhood of the Bunsen burner} objec- ‘

tive consideration of the purpose and methods of
art and the artist leaves no doubt "that their func-
tion is indispensable to our society and will remain
so as long asthe basic unit of that society is man.

The current Fine Arts Department exhibit en-
titled “Poetry and Art” provides precisely the
background material that has been previously lack-
ing for that objective consideration of the place of
art in our modern society. In drawing corollaries
between the plastic and the literary aspects of ﬁne
art, the exhibit clariﬁes those very values which
are the basis of art and its creation.
Exhibit Useful

The exhibit is useful ﬁrst of all in arriving at
some indication of the purpose of art. An examina-
tion of the seventh ﬂoor gallery reveals ﬁrstva
broad variety of subject matter. This coupled with
visually distorted representations of reality has

probably led to the popular belief that art can be i

little more than superﬁcial. This is a result of a
basic misconception regarding the crgative process.

The literal subject-in-hand of a work is merely
the‘ vehicle. The real subject of the artist is man.
He is trying to understand man by examining his
own and other’s subjective reactions. This accounts
for the apparent distortions of reality. The Greek
frieze and Paul Klee, the Odyssey and Emily Dick-
inson record not the eventbut man’s reaction to it,
and it is here that art differentiates itself from the
objectivity that is science.

The ability to give tangible form to abstract

concepts, right and wrong, love and hate,‘ is so in-,

tegral a component of art that it must belong to art

Sit, Smoke and Stare . . ._

 
   

by deﬁnition. Through the use of sensuryadetail
and sensory images, the artist can not only.-recreate
a given event or scene, but he can recreate itzzas it
appears only to him. Art then serves the dual
function of providing vicarious experience and of
giving comment on that experience. It is a means
through which man can place himself inside an-
other’s skin and experience the wistful irony of a
sad-faced Roualt clown or the gentle pathos of Paul
Klee’s “Singer of the Comic Opera.” Even if he has
seen these things himself, they take on a new
dimenson of meaning as he sees them through the
eyes or feels them through the skin of the artist.

The photograph or the lab report cannot give him

this other view.
Reference Poini V

The practical signiﬁcance of this -comparing of
subjective notes is that of providing a reference

point for man in a society where permanent values 

elude him like forgotten names and in which he
wallows not only unable to touch bottom, but un-
able to determine the relative direction of ﬁrm

(footing. All-time highs in insanity, divorce, and

crimes of willful violence bear witness to the in-
adequacy of man’s attempts to locate himself.
“Normal” personality has suddenly become the ex-

ception rather than the rule. Religion and philoso- I

phy attempt to provide the needed reference point,
but because of their abstract nature they fail in
the same way as attempts to deﬁne insanity in
terms of atoms or electrons fail. Until they assume
concrete signiﬁcance, only the ﬁne arts can provide \_

the necessary tangible statement of human experi- 

ence and present man to himself for his critical
judgment and reﬂection.

-

Since his earliest distinction from the lower ani- «

mals, man has directed his capacity for abstract

thought into the three areas of the natural sciences, >

the social sciences, and the humanities, respective-
ly concerning themselves with his attempt to under-.
stand the external world, his fellow man, and him-
self. He persists in paying lip service to the trinity,
but in spite of his almost frantic efforts to orient
himself in the ﬁrst two areas, he chooses to disre-
gard the third. The capacity of the human organism
to contradict in practice the product of its own

‘rational theorizing was never more graphically’

demonstrated.
If during the course of man’s developmentit was,
ever necessary for him to examine himself, it is’

necessary now. It is time \for the scientist to come. “

down from his ivory tower and reorient himself.
It is time and past time for not only the scientist,
but the entire insulated mess of society to‘ come
down out of the trees and relearn to live actively
with itself.

How About You?

 

By Vcmge Metros
Are you one of the members
of the sit, smoke, and stare so-

ciety? If so, you are fraternizing I‘

with a very select and choice
group of individuals. A member
of this society is readily identi-
ﬁed. There is the shifty-eyed
look, the glance of boredom, the
sly smile that occurs when a
good joke has been told, and the
bleary-eyed look of too much
inhaling about a sit, smoke, and
stare member.

This society was organized in
September when the-Blue Tuck
Shop granted the use of its
booths to those students who
wish to spend all their free time
(some even cut classes) sitting,
smoking, and staring._ At ﬁrst,
the freshmen and transfers hesi-
tated upon devoting so much
“precious” time for such a se-
ciety. But the newcomers did
get into the groove within a
month. Cokes and cigarettes are
universally accepted as refresh-
ments. These students meet any
hour of the day, ﬁve days of the
week.

Become Member

To become a member of this
society, you must have the de-
sire to spend at least one hour
in the Blue Tuck. Once you
settle down in your sitting posi-
tion in the booth, glance around
at the surrounding area and
make a mental note of who is
there for future reference and
use. '

Your debut will probably be

‘designated when you volunteer

to go through line and get the
cokes. Of course, all the eyes of
the members wil1”be"upon‘-you. I

   
 

Head in the air, bored manner
about you, pave your way
through a mob, while carrying
your tray full of cokes, and pro-
ceed back to your booth. After
you plunk your cokes down on
the table, sit and light up your
cigaret.

The ﬁrst step of your initia-
tion has now been passed. The

- rest of the initiation period con-

sists of careful observance of

.your attitude by the other mem-

bers. i Never decline a cigaret,
have a good joke ready to tell
at any time, and have a few
choice words to offer about mem-
bers of the opposite sex. Oh, be
sure to eat the ice outofyour
coke.

Fear and worry may consume
you, while you wonder if you’ve

made it or not. After waiting *-

about a day, you know you’ve
made it, when you hear those
glorious words,

“Meet you in“

,7 _ J

the Blue Tuck.” Well, you’re in, ’

you’re a member of the sit,
smoke, and stare society. Con-
gratulations! Now that you are 'a
member, you are allowed to eye-
ball to your heart’s desire. And

“\you even get ‘a free bottle of

eyewash f o r overly-strained
eyes. 
There are some members who

complain of the stuﬁiness and
of the smoky atmosphere in the
Blue Tuck, but they are the ones
who don’t budge from the booth’
for fear that they may miss out
on something. Remember, there’s

nothing that can compare with\_

sit, smoke, and stare.

Editor, the Pitt News:

In answer to Mr. Jacob’s de-
fense of Vice-President Nixon,

it is unlikely that a man who
has suffered a serious heart at-
tack and major operation short-
ly after will survive four years
at the hardest job in the world,
that is, being president. There-
fore, if the Eisenhower-Nixon
ticket is elected in 1956, Nixon
will probably be president by
1960. Mr. Rothman has stated
Eisenhower’s failings well, so I
-Won’t elaborate on them. How-
ever, Nixon’s‘are another thing.
I don’t think we want a “minor

league McCarthy?’ as Epresidentzl

~ ‘  " Harvey Klelman, Ed. ’53

Nixon’s exposure of Alger Hiss
was quite admirable, but his
twice getting elected to the
House of Representatives by
identifying his opponents as

and his identifying the Demo-
cratic party likewise in 1952 are
inexcusable. ’

Nor do Mr. Eisenhower’s

dual mean much when «his ad-
ministration has tram-pad on

A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED,

‘Y

R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when he
ﬁnished high school he wished mightily to go on with his
education. It seemed, however, a forlorn hope. Crop
failures had brought his father to the brink of disaster.
(R. L.’s father raised date palms which, in North Dakota,
is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.) Nor could’

R. L.’s mother help; she had grown torpid since the death
of Rudolph "Valentino.

R. L. could go to college only if he worked his way
lilll‘i)llg“ll.. This was a prospect that dismayed him.

Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pon-..
dering his dilemma. One day, walking and breeding, he
came upon a park bench and sat down and lit a Philip‘
Morris. (There is no occasion, happy or sad, pensive or
exuberant, when Philip. Morris is not entirely. welcome,

as you will discover when you go to your favorite tobacco
counter and buy some.)

R. L.—was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, “My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?”

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with
wispy, snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent,
showing a delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His
back was bent, and his hands trembled. “Do you think,
sir,” said R.L., “that a boy can work his way through
college and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?”

“Why, bless you, son,” replied the stranger with a

rheumy chuckle, “of course. In fact, I did it myself."

“Was it very hard?” asked R. L.

“Yes, it was hard,” the stranger admitted. “But when

Gridders Hammer Irish, 26-13

Long Runs Thrill
Crowd; Bagamery,
Salvaterra Shine
BY ED KOLTISKA

For 20 years the« Panthers
were unable to upend Notre
Dame’s Fighting Irish at the

Stadium. Finally, under the
tutelage of Coach John

_ Michelosen, the Junge Cats

broke the jinx and trounced

‘Notre Dame, 26-13, to put their

record at 5-2.

The irony is this contest is that
Coach Michelosen quarterbacked
the last Oakland team to_defeat

the ‘Irish at the‘ Stadium, 26-0, in

1936.

Some 58,697 fans watched

R 6 Notre Dame go down to defeat as

“they played one of their best
games this season,” exclaimed Ed
(Moose) Krause, Athletic Direc-
tor of Notre Dame.
Panthers Build Lead

The Panther offense was just a

little too much for the Irish to

‘ handle. In the second quarter, the

Jungle Cats made two ‘drives of
72 and 87 yards for touchdowns.
Corny Salvaterra, on a pass
attempt; ran around ,_ his right
end for the score when he saw
that his receivers were covered.
Ten minutes later, Salvaterra
passed to Joe Walton in the end
zone for the second touchdown.

Bags Bagamery” missed the

‘extra point after the ﬁrst score,’

but Darrell Lewis converted after
the second touchdown to lead
Notre Dame, 13-0, with 49 sec-
onds remaining in the half.
Hornung Runs 50 Yards

The Irish took over on their
own 50-yard line after Lewis
kicked out of bounds twice. Paul
Hornung, billed as All-American,
lived up to his press notices.

On a pass attempt Hornung
was trapped in his own back-
ﬁeld; but evaded Panther tack-
lers and scampered 50 yards
down the right sidelines for a
touchdown.. Hornung’s place-
ment was wide to make the
score 13-6 at the half.

With the weather ranging be-
tween 34-37 degrees, the Jungle
Cats used the third quarter as a
Warm—up period. -

Bagamery Shines

After an exchange of punts, the

Panther forward wall stopped an

,Irish drive’ on the nine-yard line.

Here the coaching staff unveiled
new offensive power in Bagamery.
With the ball on the 27, Bagamery
cut off tackle and romped 53
yards before being brought down
from the. rear on the Irish 21-
yard line.
Theodore climaxed the drive
as he broke over left tackle for
seven yards and a touchdown.

Boaters Defeat Denison, 2-1,

After Losing to Ohio State, 3-2

By MURRAY A. CHASS _
Sophomore sensation Chuck Kane scored two goals, one
in the last ten seconds, at Denison, Saturday, to salvage a

split for the Panther booters in

their weekend series in Ohio.

The ‘Frank Meriwell’ ﬁnish gave the locals a 2-1 victory

after they had lost in the same-9
fashion Friday at Columbus. In
that one with Ohio State, the
Buckeyes won with'only 62 sec-
onds remaining in the game, 3-2.

Coach Leo Bemis ‘described
both the Denison players and fans

goal hit the nets.

OSU Roars Back

Jack Coulter, inside left‘, had
put the Big Red in front in the
third quarter after a scoreless
ﬁrst half, Kane tied it up later in
the same period. ,

On Friday the soccerites had a
2-0 lead at halftime, but Ohio
State struck back for a single
goal in the third quarter and a
pair in the last.

Sam Hazou continued his scor-
ing ways with a goal in the open-
ing stanza; and then Lee Good-
man, a sophomore who has pick-
ed up greatly in the past two
weeks, accounted for his second
goal in as many games in the sec-

But in the second half Ken
Bertz, Som Lesheim, and Paul
Hartman scored in that order to
insure the Buckeyes’ win.

Besides the improvement of

the only substitute used in the
Denison game, Bemis is more
than pleased with his sophomore
goalie, Ron Goga. Goga replaced
the injured Ben Cheshelski for

the Ohio trip and played two ex- _

cellent games in the cage.

The Panthers now have a sea-
son report car.d of three wins,

fourth losses, and one tie.

Meanwhile, the freshman squad

ﬁnished their regular season last-

Wednesday with a win over the
Kiski Prep eleven, 3“-2. Pete Kar-
avellas, a former Greek Naval
officer, scored two of the goals,
and Simeon Pestish kicked in the
other. This gave the yearlings a
2-2-1 mark.

How would a
graduate degree
affectrny chances
foradvancement
at‘:Du,Pont? I

 

   

John Nettleton wants to know:

Robert J. Buch. M.S., Ch.E., came to the Engineering Devel-
opment Section of Du Pont’s Grasselli Research Division from
the University of Louisville four years ago. Since then, he has

engaged in many kinds of chemical engineering work, from pilot-

plant operation to evaluation of the potential of proposed re-
search programs. Within the last year, Bob has taken the re-
sponsibility of procuring B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. technical gradu-
ates in all phases of chemistry and chemical engineering for the

Grasselli Research Division.

‘ is advanced degree would undoubtedly have a favorable
effect in technical work, John, but let me enlarge on
that just a little. In your own ﬁeld (and mine, too) a
higher degree is considered to be evidence of ability in
carrying out original research. It is therefore helpful in
obtaining work in research and development, where that
skill isdeﬁnitely important. You might say that it gives a
man a head start in proving his ability in those areas.
It's less important in some other areas, though. For
example, in. production or sales work ability for handling,
human relationships is just as important foradvancement
as~technical competence. If an engineer is sold on pro-
duction work or sales, a graduate degree in marketing
or business administration might be more helpful to him
than advanced technical training in getting started.

, John c. Nettloton expects to receive his Rs. in chemical engineer-
ing from Villanova University in June 1957. He has served as presi-
dent of the student chapter of A.I.Ch.E., and as secretary of Phi
Kappa Phi fraternity. John\ is now wondering about the pros and
cons of advanced study in his ﬁeld. 1

Bob Buch answers:

 
  

But I’ve noticed this at Du Pont. Once a man lands a
job in his chosen ﬁeld and actually begins to work, his
subsequent advancement depends more on demonstrated
ability than on college degrees. That's true throughout
the entire company—in scientiﬁc work, administration,

or what not.

So an advanced degree is not a royal road to anything
at Du Pont, John. But when coupled with proven abili-
ties, it is unquestionably helpful to a man in research and

development work. It often gets him off to a faster start.

Terry Must Win I
At Notre Dame

By STEVE BUTCIIOCK

Sports Editor

 

Notre Dame coach Terry Brennan said absolutely nothing to

his gridders as they Hwearily pulled themselves back into the dressing
room after the 26-13 loss to the Panthers Saturday. For the sixth time
this season there was nothing but bitter gloom and silence awaiting

the once proud Irish.

At just the mention of Notre Dame before this year one in-
variably thought in terms ofwinning, unparalleled school spirit, and
great ﬁgures such as Knute Rockne and George Gipp.

The only thing the Irish had Saturday was spirit, but even.
spirit isn’t enough when you run up against a superior team.
The South Benders are down, but they aren’t out according to
Brennan. Terry feels that his team is improving as the season

progresses.

Nevertheless, Brennan let a little slip Saturday which gave the
impression that he seesa couple 'more defeats coming up before the

season is over.

As he was being questioned, the youthful Irish mentor unknow-
ingly, barely above a whisper, mumbled as he shook his ‘head, “Three
more to go.” Then Brennan proceeded to name the Irish’s three re-
maining opponents-—North Carolina, Iowa, and Southern California

-——with apprehensiveness.

It wasn’t hard to reason that the season couldn’t ‘end any
too soon for Terry. The strain and torture of losing appears to
be taking its toll on the ex—Notre Dame halfback who succeeded
Frank Leahy. So ‘far the public and the alumni have remained
rather silent about Notre Dame’s grid fortunes, probably ﬁguring

that the Irish will rebound next
year. If they don’t B r e n n a n
could possibly be looking for
another coaching position.

At Notre Dame the trait of tra-
dition has placed unremovable
pressure and burden on the coach.
It’s a cinch‘that Brennan will hvae
to win or go. Leahy always won
and it’s doubtful if a healthy
Leahy would be there today, even
if he were still winning.

Harriers Lose

To Penn State

By MIKE GERBER
Last Friday the Panther
harriers saw their ﬁve m,eet
winning streak come to an
abrupt end as Chick Werner’s
Penn State Lions took the

measure of the injury riddled
Panthers», 21-34.

Vince Timon and Jimmy Moore
did not run for the Panthers, and
as it turned out, the absence of
these two stellar performers un-
doubterdly was the difference be-
tween winning and losing.

Timon was hospitalized as a
result of the food poisoning
which he and the rest of the
team incurred on the ill-fated
trip to West Point.

Moore was not able to com-
pete because of a persistent groin
ailment. Also unable to run for
the Panthers was Tom Jessup.

Leading the way for Penn State
were Captain Don Woodrow, and
sophomore Fred Kerr. Woodrow
placed first as he covered the 5.2
mile course in 26:55. r

Following Woodrow and Kerr
were the Blue and Gold’s John
Christof and Thornton Smith,
who were third and fourth re-
spectively.

However, Ed Moran, Clem
Schoenbuck, and Bob Thompson
of Penn State ﬁnished ﬁfth, sixth,
and seventh, to‘ give the victory
to the Nittany Lions. Rounding
out the top ten ﬁnishers were
Wendell Harford, Dale Fauser,
and Chuck James, all of Sky-'
scraper U.

Sowell Eyes Olympic Laurels

Mathias Predicts
Arnie Will -Finish _
Behind Courtney

The Olympic torch is burning
in Melbourne, and when the 17th
mod ern Olympiad commences
later this month, Pitt will have
the distinction of having its third
participant - Arnie Sowell -~‘ in
the greatest sports spectacle of
them all.

The Blue and Gold greats pre-
ceding Sowell were Johnny
Woodruff (1936) and Herb Doug-
las (1948). In the 1936 games at
Berlin, Germany, Woodruff won
a Gold Medal for the 800 meter
run, the same event in which
Arnie ,will be entered.

In Sowell, though, Coach Carl
Olson probably has the most
versatile athlete in the history
of track at Skyscraper U. He
has competed in the 440-yard
dash, 880-yard run, low hurdles,
broad jump, high jump, mile
run, and various relay teams
ranging from a half-mile to two
miles.

Sowell has been a champion
from his high school ‘days at
Schenley to the present. He is
holder of many records. Among
these, he holds the IC4A 880-yard

run record of 1:50.3. This broke
the- record of Johnny Woodruff.
In early 1955 Arnie established a
new world’s record for 880 “four
turn” run at the National AAU
Championships at Boulder, Colo-
rado. His time was 1247.6.

In 1956 Arnie kept pace as he
successfully defended his 800
meter title. He won for the sec-

time the 880-yard ICAA cham-
pionship. Also for the record
third time in a row he won the
IC4A 880. .

Despite all these records most

“ track experts predict Arnie will

run second to Tom Courtney in
the 800 meter run in the Olym-
pics.

Other competition will come
from Be1gium’s Roger Moens who
holds the world’s 800 meter record
at 1245.7. Recently Moens injured
himself and may not be in top
condition for the Olympics. _

Bob Mathias, in predicting the
order, of finish in the Olympics,
puts Sowell second in "the 800
meter run.

Arnie is now in San Francisco
with track coach Carl Olson
training for the games.

, Coach Olson gave up his other
duties. at the University in order
to help Arnie in the last few days
of practice before the team de-
parts for Melbourne. Woodruff
brought back a spark from the
torch at Berlin. There is a good

chance that Arnie will bring back’

a spark from Melbourne, too.

College President Tells

o o c '
OfEng1neer1ng Shortage
In a speech on Nov. 3, Dr. John T. Rettaliata, president
of Illinois Institute of Technology at the sixth annual Tool
Engineering Conference on the Illinois Tech campus warned

that Russia will surpass the United States in the number
of engineers in a year or two.

Mr. Rettaliata based this statement on a National Science
Foundation r e p o r t comparingé

Russian and American scientiﬁc
and technological manpower
totals which showed that last year
the U.S. margin had been reduced

‘to approximately 40,000.

\ The report placed the 1955 to-
tals for the two nations at 575,-
000 engineers for the United
States, and 535,000 for the Soviet
Union.

The USSR also holds a wide
lead over this country in the num-
ber of high school science and
.mathematics teachers, he stated.
Comparative totals were 130,000
to 140,000 for the United States
and 350,000 for the Russian sec-
ondary schools.

In his speech Mr. Rettaliata
stated that if the demand for
more engineers is to be met,
there must be a greater effort

Working engineers . . .

may continue study to earn Master’s degree

Ambitious young

engineering graduates today

want to be in two places at the same time. They
want to be employed as quickly as possible, work-
ing daily at a job that offers promise of a reward-
ing career. They also want to be in the classroom,
pursuing advanced studies they know to be so
essential to real professional achievement.

Recognizing the many signiﬁcant beneﬁts to be
gained by that two-fold ambition - benefits that
accrue both to the individuals, personally, and
to the company employing‘ them — Pratt & Whit-
ney Aircraft has developed an extensive graduate
fellowship program. Within easy commuting dis-
tance of P & W A facilities, working arrangements

~v have been established with graduate schools at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, University of

sity. Similar arrangements with several other uni-
versities are pending ﬁnal approval.

At each school, the qualiﬁed Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft employee is able to take courses —- within
speciﬁed areas — leading to a Master's degree.
A tuition-refund plan makes it possible for success-
ful degree candidates to obtain thistadvanced ed-

In this era of advancing technology, the world's
foremost designer and builder of aircraft engines
has taken a far-reaching step to assure its engi-
neers and scientists of the opportunity for per-
sonal growth . . . growth that is so beneﬁcial to
employee and company alike.
