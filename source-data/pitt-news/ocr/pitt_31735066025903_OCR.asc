as t e new FAS dean

Kris Kissel
Contrlbutlng Edltor

Provost James Maher is expected to
announce today that he has chosen John
Cooper, from Pitt’s chemistry depart-
ment, to be the next dean of Pitt’s biggest
school, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Administrators agree Cooper will
have to deal with several important
issues facing FAS after he takes the reins
on July 1.

Improved planning for undergradu-
ate education will be an important prior-
ity, according to the Maher.

That planning will come as part of a
much bigger picture. In the long term,
Cooper said, he wants to form a better
integration of the undergraduate, gradu-
ate and research aspects of FAS. In the
short term, he must deal with an exodus
of professors who accept the retirement
package being offered over the next

year.

Cooper said he plans to begin mak-
ing preparations very soon.

“I feel I’ve got a lot of homework to
do before I start this position,” Cooper
said. “The most important component of
that is that I hope to visit all the depart-
ments and programs in their own build-
ings, before or shortly after I start the
job.”

Cooper said his variety of experi-
ence, both at Pitt and elsewhere, should
help him to deal with all of these issues.

“I think I combine the strength of an
internal candidate with the perspective
of an external candidate,” said Cooper,
who was first a postdoctoral fellow and
later a professor in Harvard’s chemistry
department. He did his undergraduate
and graduate work at Oxford, England.

Cooper, who once chaired Pitt’s
chemistry department, said ’ his actual
title of “Dean of the Faculty and College

of Arts and Sciences” is a statement of
his and Maher’s wish for a better inte-
gration of teaching, research and schol-
arship functions. 4

Cooper said that through his own
experience, he’s come to understand
how these functions work together.

Oseola McCarty is often described as a
modern day Sojourner Truth.

After quitting school at the age of 12
she started her own laundry business and

1,; continued to do other people’s larmdry for
H 70 years. McCarty, now 86, inspired the
‘nation when she gave her life savings of

1 $150,000 to the University of Southern
Mississippi to fund scholarships for African
5 American students. She hopes these schol-
f arships will ease ﬁnancial concems and help

«she recipients get through college.
“v .“I didn’t get an education of my own,”

, McC/artysaid, “but I sure know the value of

one.

l"_..Carty, “the laundress who gives
scholarships,” was the guest of honor Friday
night at the University’s Tribute to
Excellence and Education.

The evening began with an informal
gathering in the Ballroom of the William
Pitt Union where McCarty met with guests
and sold autographed copies of her book.

The formal program began in the
Assembly Room of the Union. Featured
guests were Some of God’s Children
Gospel Choir with Mime group Divine
Reﬂections, the African American Dance
Workshop, Nathan Davis Jazz Ensemble,
Debra Starling of Kuntu Repertoire Theatre
and Garbon Duvall of Pitt’s music depart-

ment.

Pitt showed McCarty the talents and ‘

achievements of its own African American
students.

The usually ﬁve-rninute walk
from Bruce Hall to the Medical Arts
Building took much longer for
Megan Sullivan this past Tuesday.
Slowed by a throat infection and the
characteristically cold February
wind, the Pitt sophomore hoped her
trudge to Student Health Service
would at least be satisﬁed with care.

What she received, she said,.was
a reception as cold as the biting air
outside and an appointment for the
next day. So Wednesday, Sullivan
had to retrace her steps, but this time
sicker, and a whole lot angrier.

Gone are the days of walk-in
care at SHS. Students must now
make an appointment, and hope their.
illnesses do not worsen in the mean-
time.

In Sullivan’s case, it did.

A SHS brochure states:
“Appointments are available with
nurses, nurse practitioners, and
physicians. Walk-in patients are eval-
uated by a nurse, who will schedule
appointments, as necessary.”

According to Sullivan, she was
not evaluated by a nurse upon arrival.

“No, that ‘didn’t happen,” she
said, recalling her initial Visit. “The
receptionist wasn’t giving in. It did-
n’t seem to matter that I was sick.”

Sullivan said that she didn’t have
the energy to offer much resistance to
the receptionist. “I was too sick to
argue.” _

On ‘Wednesday, after Sullivan
pleaded to get her 3 pm; appoint-
ment “moved up, a Student Health
Service nurse practitioner evaluated
Sullivan’s condition. Her throat was
so badly swollen and inﬂamed, the

nurse practitioner immediately

referred Sullivan to Presbyterian

Hospital.

After arrivingat the hospital by
Pitt Police car, Sullivan was again
evaluated and then treated for what
was diagnosed as severe strep throat.
The cost of the emergency room
visit, which was not covered by the
$65 student health fee, was
Sullivan’s responsibility.

At the hospital, Sullivan said she
was given steroids by doctors to

Wally ”Famous" Amos expounds upon his WATERMELON theory. 

Famous Amos cooks 

Christal Hall

 

Staff Writer

Wally “Famous” Amos said he was
always on the lookout for a superstar to
represent. He ﬁnally found one —- the
chocolate chip cookie.

Wherever we go, his cookies ‘are
famous — in Japan, Malaysia,
Singapore, Indonesia, the United States
and Canada.

Amos said he made the cookies
according to his Aunt Della’s recipe,
which he eventually called the “Famous

- Amos Chocolate Chip Cookie.”

Amos opened his ﬁrst store on Los
Angeles’ Sunset Boulevard in 1975, sup-
ported by friends Marvin Gaye and
Helen Reddy.

“When I ﬁrst opened the store my
motto was, ‘If you have a mouth, you are
a potential client,’” Amos said.

After the ﬁrst two years, Amos said,
the company was baking more than six
tons of cookies each week at the Sunset
Boulevard shop and at the Nutley, N.J.,
factory. He was grossing more than $1
million a year from sales to stores such
as Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus.

Amos said that when he missed
some ﬁne print in a legal document, he
left his company open to a buyout.
Seven months into the litigation win get
back his company name, Famous Amos,
he started a new company, Uncle
Nonarne. His new company he sells
cookies and muffins.

Amos said he is always traveling to
promote both his baked goods and his
secrets to success. He has appeared on
“The Merv Grifﬁn Show,” “Good
Morning America” and “The Today
Show.”

He has written three books, includ-
ing his autobiography, “The Famous
Amos Story: The Face That Launched a
Thousand Chips,” “The Power in You”

'.

and his most recent book, “Watermelon 3
Magic.” 
Amos said “Watermelon Magic” 
about making your own choices. He said
he encourages African Americans not to
allow themselves to be manipulated or 4.‘
stereotyped. . ..
“A lot of people say ‘Oh, I’m 
black’ ,” Amos said, “So what? You 
wake up every morning black, deal with ‘it
it.” ’

Mm it as,» ,

Amos said he wears shoes with 
watermelons on them to remind him of
his watermelon credo. ,

“W” is for “whatever you believe 
creates your reality.” 

“The person who says ‘I can’ and ‘I
can’t’ is right,” Amos said. 

“A” is “attitude is the magic word.” ,4’

“I would rather hire someone with a 
great attitude and with minimum skills
rather than hire someone with great§€
skills and a bad attitude,” Amos said. '
“The one with litﬂe skills will be quick-
er to learn.” ~—

“T” is for “togethemess; everyone;
achieves more when there is a group’
eﬁort.” 
“The only thing you can do by your:
self is fail,” Amos said. 
He said he lost the Famous 
Company because he didn’t want 
help from others. In his new companéi
Uncle Noname, he hired six people

nicates on a daily basis. A r  ‘

Brothers in CMU’s Phi Kappa Theta fraternity chapter aren’t speaking to the press.

Jeff Christman
For The Pltt News

For Phi Kappa Theta brothers at
Carnegie Mellon University, mum is the
word.

The fraternity house, just a few miles

7 ﬁom the Cathedral, has a celebrity-by—asso-
 ciation on its rolls: Monica Lewinsky’s

I sophomore brother Michael. And that has
_ journalists scrambling to the Moorewood

Avenue frat house.

Lewinsky refused to talk to the media,
but when independent counsel Kenneth
Starr sent three FBI agents to interview him
Feb. 7, he was forced to talk.

Details of the meeting between ﬂre FBI
and Lewinsky are not known. A

Starr is investigating allegations that
former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky had an affair with President
Clinton and was encouraged to lie about it
under oath.

According to The Washington Post, B

Lewinsky’s attorney, William Ginsburg,
claimed Michael Lewinsky told FBI agents
he had no helpful information because he
didn’t know anything about his sister’s pro-
fessional or social life.

Bill Kreily, spokesman for the FBI’s
Pittsburgh bureau, was not available for
comment. “I

Lewinsky remains holed up in the Phi
Kap house letting his fraternity brothers
“oeak for him. 8

But the Phi Kaps aren’t talking.

Fraternity‘ President Jason Reisman
declined comment, and three fraternity
brothers, including Lewinsky, did not return

FBI visits Lewinsky’s brother

requests ﬁom The Pitt News for comment.

The brothers also had nothing to say to
the Associated Press, WTAE Channel 4 or
countless other media outlets.

’ “Michael Lewinsky has been very clear
with me and others that he does not want to
talk to the media,” said CMU spokesman
Don Hale.

“I think the ﬁaternity is doing an excel-
lent job in protecting Michael’s right to pri-
vacy,” said Brian Krug, president of the
Carnegie Mellon student government.

“He shouldn’t have to lose his right to
privacy, to go to class, to lead a normal life
because of something that may or may not
have gone on with the president,” Krug said.

Hale shared similar sentiments. '

“I think the fraternity has been good in
helping Michael out,” he said

Krug said that despite l\/Iichael’s
unwanted fame, CIVIU students are not treat-
ing him any ditferently;

“I think it’s more of an attitude of indif-
ference. They don’t really think it’s as big of
a deal as the media makes it out to be,” Krug
said. ’

But the media have been generally
cooperative, according to Hale.

“I would say we’ve received pretty
good cooperation from the press in regards

to Michael Lewinsky  [though] we’re not.

surprised by the interest in the media,” said
Hale. “I think the press, in the most part, has
been pretty cooperative in recognizing his
interest in being as student at Carnegie
Mellon and conducting his daily aifairs.”

Both the director of greek life, Dean
Allison, and ClVIU’s chief of police, Jim
LaPaglia, declined comment. A

have twin goals of excellence — in
‘undergraduate and graduate education,’
and ‘research and scholarship,” he said.
“There is a tension between those, but I
think it is a creative tension.” .

Cooper described how teaching h
inﬂuenced his research — that under-
graduates and beginning graduate stu-
dents have often asked him simple ques-
tions that changed the way he looked at
his own work.

He also explained how working to
stay at the forefront of his ﬁeld has
allowed him to effectively teach students
the real-world importance of what they
learn in a classroom.

Maher said he would like Cooper to
share with the faculty the understanding
of how a major university should oper-
ate.

“[Cooper must] bring all of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences to a com-
mon understanding of the importance of
working together to build strong pro-
grams in undergraduate education, grad-
uate education and research,” said
Maher. ‘

_Maher added that Pitt has a long-
standing problem with people tending to
make decisions about the undergraduate
programs separately. but the undergradu-
ate programs have not gotten the kind of

FROM PAGE 1

integration and planning they should
receive with the research and graduate
programs.

“The key issue here is to make sure
the resources of the arts and sciences are
deployed to treat them [teaching and
research] all as important, rather than to
have some kind of piecemeal planning
that affects one aspect while neglecting
others,” Maher added.

That deployment of resources will,
to a large degree, be accomplished by
how Cooper decides to deal with the
aftermath left by the current retirement
package, which is enticing eligible pro-
fessors to end their careers with Pitt
within the next year.

“The crucial point,” said current
FAS Dean Peter Koehler, “will be the
selective rebuilding of the faculty after
the impact of the early retirement depar-
tures.”

Koehler, who has been FAS dean
since 1986, said he knows something
about building a school’s faculty; in the
last 12 years, he has hired about half of
the currently active tenured and tenure-
stream professors.

Cooper will have to do a lot of
rebuilding in a very short time.

“I think we’re at a very unusual
time, because we have an urgent short-
time priority: We have to adapt to the
changes that are going to come with the
early retirement plan,” said Cooper.

“We are going to lose a signiﬁcant
number of faculty out of FAS,” Cooper
predicted. “But we have to manage those

’ changes so they help us to fulfill our

goals.”

Those goals, according to Cooper,
include making sure the savings from the
retirement package translate into
improved opportunities for research and
instruction for the undergraduates. ’

In the last year, the FAS administra-
tion has decided to aim for a faculty size
of 505 tenured and tenure-stream profes-
sors. That would mean eliminating
almost 60 such positions from what FAS I
currently employs.

Administrators expect to lose more
than this number through the retirement
package. It will then be up to«Cooper to
decide how best to rebuild the faculty.
That will mean selecting departments
which he will allot tenure—stream posi-
tions, so they can hire new assistant pro-
fessors. It will also mean implementing a
plan to hire full-time, non-tenure-stream
instructors to pick up the slack in the
teaching workload.

“FAS has agreed to a faculty size of
505, and that means we need to recog-
nize the reality that we are going to need
help instructing students,” said Cooper.

Cooper was part‘ of the _Faculty
Planning and Advisory Committee last
year which produced the Phase IV docu-
ment — a description of Pitt’s plan to

 

' decrease the faculty size and supplement

it with non-tenure-stream postdoctoral
fellows.

“The number 505,”
Koehler, “is simply a total number meant
for the school. What has not been done is
to decide how much of that reduction
will be done in each department.”

I Koehler said_ the decision for a fac-
ulty size of 505 professors is “a compro-
mise between a necessary budgetary
reduction and an assessment that we did
not feel we could go lower than that and
still maintain quality.” A

Koehler refrained from making any
major decisions along those lines for the
past year, he said, so that he would not"
block the freedom of his successor. .

“I think John [Cooper] is an excel-'

lent choice, and he and I will work very .

well together to make this a very smooth
transition,” said Koehler. f

Cooper, who had to interrupt a
Saturday afternoon phone interview to
pick up his daughter from a piano lesson,
has been at Pitt since 1986 — the same
year Peter Koehler came to Pitt as dean
of FAS. .

When asked how he and his family
will adapt to the" long hours and heavy
workload of an upper-level administra-_
tor, Cooper said, “Family life is very
important to me, but I think we’re used
to balancing the pressure and conﬂict of
work and family life.”

reduce the swelling in her throat, as
well as prescriptions for the infection
and the pain. While she was relieved
that she finally received the needed
medical care, she was nevertheless
upset by the lack of attention she said
she got at the original visit.

“My biggest gripe is that they
[SHS] let it progress until it was out of
their hands. I’m really disheartened by
the whole situation,” Sullivan said

Pitt spokesperson Kenneth
Service, who said he was unaware of
the new SHS policy, declined to com-
ment.

Sullivan had visited SHS before
and was pleased with the care and the
immediate attention. She said the qual-

FROM PAGE 1

 

ity of care at SHS is excellent, but is
not alone in her dislike of the new
appointment policy which began last
fall. According to Pitt student Dave
Mansueto, the new policy “is a horrible
step backwards. I thought it was much
better before.”

Mansueto, like Sullivan, visited
SHS in the past and received prompt,
quality care. “Last year I had mononu-
cleosis and the nurse practitioner
immediately ordered a blood test.
Things were better before. The new
policy seems absurd,” Mansueto said.

A Sullivan said she feels that any
future health concerns will be person-
ally evaluated before making an
appointment at SHS. “From my view-
point, if it’s serious enough, I’m going
right to the hospital. I’ve learned my
lesson.”

a victim.”
“I’ll never look at a watermelon the
same,” said Lassain Robinson, a member

 

“Black people are good at becoming a
victim and blaming the white man,” Amos
joked. “Why isn’t it the white woman?”

Amos said that if he can make it, any-
one can make it. He said that black people
say that the white man has his foot on
African Americans’ necks. He said that no
one has to keep them down.

“The system doesn’t know whether
you’re black or white,” Amos said. “The
man who works in the system might

know.”

Amos was born in Tallahassee, Fla.,
and raised by his mother, Ruby, until age
12. After his parents divorced he went to

New York City to live with his Aunt Della. .

Amos said as a teenager he attended a
New York City trade school and had an
apprenticeship at a local hotel as a cook

He said he quit six months before gradua— I
tion and joined the Air Force. After serv— .
ing four years, Amos returned to New ;
York and went to work, ﬁrst at Saks Fifth *
Avenue and later at the Morris Agency. He ’

said at in both jobs he started at the bottom
and by hard work he climbed to the top.
“I’ve been knocked down and I keep
getting back up,” Amos said. “Life is
about bouncing back, not rolling over.”

Amos said one of his favorite poems i

is “The Eagle” by James Agrey. At the end
of the poem it says, “My people of Africa,

we are eagles taught to be chickens. Don’t 
be satisﬁed with chicken feed that is ,

thrown at you.”

Amos said, “Whatever your sex, color 

or size, use it and make it work for you.”

The Pitt News

 

Good stuff about the ’Burgh, n ’at

Heather Barnett

Morehours, less hassle
for health services

People can't schedule an illness.

But that's exactly what students must do if
they want Student Health Services to help them.

The policy Student Health Services adopted
last fall eliminates walk-in visits in all but emer-
gencies. According to a brochure, walk-in

patients are supposed to be evaluated by nurses»

who will schedule appointments "as necessary."

That makes it extremely unlikely that any-
body will receive care in the early stages of an
infection or sickness —— while it would stillbe
easy to treat.

Instead, most students will be put off until a
there» is an empty space in an appointment book,
while their illnesses will have progressed further.

On top of that, we have at_least one instance
where a student, Megan Sullivan, wasn't even
evaluated by a nurse on walk-in, but instead had
to deal with a stubborn receptionist who refused
to hear her complaints.

That student's illness worsened by the time of
her appointment, and she had to go to a hospital
emergency room — a trip that is not covered by
her student health fee.

Paying a health fee serves students no purpose
if they will have to pay for normal health insur-

;_ ance anyway’ to afford hospital visits that "could
 have been avoided in the first place.

If Student Health Services believes it cannot

;treat all the patients in a day who come as walk-

“ ins, in addition to its scheduled patients, then its
‘administrators should consider keeping the
offices open 24 hours a day. '

’ Service around the clock would obviously ,

benefit students who cannot schedule their ill-

“asses. It would give the office more ﬂexibility
to treat incoming patients. And it would mean
that a student in Litchfield Towers who sprains an
ankle at 8 p.m. wouldn't have to climb up cardiac

.hill ‘and find the emergency department to have

something done about it.

Of course, expanded business hours will cost
more money. But students would certainly rather
pay a few extra dollars into the health services
fee each semester than shell out several hundred
dollars for a visit to the emergency room just
because the daily appointment book -was full.

Columnist

There's an old saying that
there are two sorts of people: those
who light a candle and those who
curse the darkness. We columnists
are rarely seen with a literary

match.

Maybe this gruffness says
something about writers in gener-
al, or journalists speciﬁcally, or_ our
generation or society as a whole.
Maybe it's just plain easier to list

what's wrong with the world, espe-

cially since we tend to take what's
right for granted. Either way, I feel
the need to neutralize some of my
customary vitriol with some happy

I -thoughts. (Don't worry, I promise

not to get Kathie Lee-perky on
you.) i "

Having grown up in a
hideously boring small town, I
guess I'm more .prone to appreciate
the positives of Pittsburgh than are
a great many Pitt students. What
follows is a list of things — some

small, some admittedly obvious —_—.

to be grateful for about Pittsburgh,
this most underappreciated city.

- The Steelers and accompany-
ing culture. What other excuse is
there to scream at the top of your
lungs while twirling laundry over
your head? (Ah, but I forget my
year in a Pitt dormitory... ) This
city takes its team seriously. Banks
close for playoff games. After the
AFC championship "game last
month, KDKA-TY had a psychia-
trist on to discuss sports—1oss-relat-
ed depression, with nary a tongue

in check. The Steelers ‘unite .

Pittsburghers like nothing else,
except maybe our collective hatred

 

of.... »
- Cleveland. As a liberal, I get so
few chances for mindless bigotry;
Cleveland is a treasured scapegoat.
I've never been there, I've never
(knowingly) met a Clevelander,
but I get inﬁnite joy from wry
comments about the Mistake on
the Lake. All I need to complete
this bliss is a new incantation of
the Browns to kick around. Just as
the end of the Cold War left the
United States with the feeble

enemy of Iraq, the mighty ‘Burgh

vs. Bralms rivalry has fallen to a

strong dislike of Jacksonville.
(And the Cowboys, but that does-
n't count because everybody hates
the Cowboys.) '

"n'a " —— Ever found yourself
hanging on the edge of a clause,
dangling below a participle, grasp-
ing desperately for a direct object?
In comes "n'at," a‘ vocalization in
shining armor, to transform an
embarrassing silence into a seam-
less ‘Burgh conversation!

- the neighborhoods ——
Pittsburgh is many things, but it's
certainly not bland and homoge-
neous. Our own congested, street-
wiseOak1andisafarcryfrom
upscale. (okay, borderline snotty)
Shadyside, which is nothing like
the blue-collar South Side  you

Pittsburgh are connoisseurs of’

French fries. From the soft, ‘salty
mounds of root-vegetable bliss
available at the O to the crisp,
brown steak ﬁies on “ your

THE PITT NEWS

 

Monday, 16 February 1998

 

Enough complaining about the maintenance workers, already 

Paul Clark

Columnist

The little rally held for Pitt
maintenance workers earlier this
month stands as an excellent exam-
ple ofjust how narrow-minded peo-
ple can be, how they can fail to con-
sider the big picture: the purpose of
this University -and the role of
maintenance workers.

I really shouldn't need to say
this, but just in case you didn't
know, we all have a contract with
the University of Pittsburgh: We
pay it to educate us and help us earn
a valuable, respected degree.
Realize this now: More money for
the maintenance workers means we
pay a higher tuition. The same stu-
dents who bemoan the high costs of
college and its inaffordability
(without loans) for lower-income

families, paradoxically, turn around -

and advocate higher salaries with-
out realizing this simple correla-
tion.

Further, despite the ISO's,
Students in Solidarity's, and others‘
best wishes, this University simply
can not function as a socialist insti-
tution. The chancellor's and mainte-
nance workers‘ salaries cannot and
should not be equalized. These
groups and advocates should realize
that a good chancellor costs more
than $30,000 a year. Such a salary
for our chancellor would attract

only the most desperate and incom-
petent, in the field. Remember, no
matter how much one may wish oth-
erwise, this school must remain
competitive with other schools.

Mr. Nordenberg deserves every
penny of his salary, bonus and
house. An executive of a near-bil-
lion-dollar business, our chancellor,
in a brief list, has acquired massive
donations, coordinated the work of
thousands of employees, pulled
some behind-the-scenes political
moves to find outside funding for a
convocation center, and moved the
appropriate people in place for a
revival of our football program and
the popularity and morale of our
school. To label a bonus for these
outstanding achievements "a dis-
grace" is to deny the reality of dif-
ferences between the jobs of chan-
cellor and maintenance worker.

The duties of a maintenance
worker vary, but mowing lawns and
tossing out trash are no comparison
to the above. If every Pitt mainte-
nance worker strikes, each will be
easily and quickly replaced. In fact,
a great many of Pitt maintenance
workers are simply unnecessary —
specifically those cleaning the
dorms. _

Look in the mirror: We're all at
least 18 and we're all big people
now. We can vacuum our own hall-
ways, take turns hosing down our
own group showers, and clean up

our own messes. Conceivably, our
great RAs could set up a nice alter-
nating work schedule that would
take very little time for pairs.
Instructors could clean their own
blackboards and residents can

unclog their own toilets. With a lit-

He said

tle personal respon-
sibility, a lot of this
University's salary
costs could be cut.

As far as person-
al responsibility
goes, those who rally
for the Pitt mainte-
nance workers could
use a huge dose of it.
If you truly believe,
as some protestors
profess, that our
maintenance workers
do an outstanding
job — if you walk
down the hallway
and have been so
seriously» impressed
byits cleanliness and
upkeep — do not point at the
University and yell, "They have the
money." Instead, seek out the work-
er responsible for this heavenly job,
feel into your own wallet, pull out
$20, and give it to him or her. If
YOU honestly feel that the person
who cleans your dorm or classroom
deserves more money then YOU
give him a tip. ‘ ‘

AHA! We have reached the true

purpose of those who protest.
They're just out there protesting
because it makes themselves feel
good. They feel like they're stand-
ing up for some weakened, inca-
pable group that's being oppressed.
News ﬂash: The Pitt maintenance
workers can take
care of themselves.
In fact, most have
made good lives for
themselves. ,

However, the
fact that a mainte-
nance worker can-
not perform the job
of chancellor and
therefore should not
earn an equal salary
does _not mean he
deserves your pity
or your rally. Low-
skill, low—educa- -
tional level jobs
translate into lower
salaries. To obtain a
. higher wage in our"
market, one needs to obtain higher
skills or a higher education. No
illogical complaints, no feel—good
rallies, and no strike can replace
that fact.

Paul Clark has cleaned toilets in
previous occupations and can do it
so well that ”the Virgin Mary would
be proud to sit on it” — Full Metal
Jacket. k ' » -~

Ridge getting
too much credit
for too little help

I am writing in response to all
the praise Gov. Ridge is receiving
for giving Pitt over $100 million
dollars.

Sure, I am pleased that Pitt will
be getting new buildings and reno-
vating the older ones, but no one
has taken any notice that nothing is
being done about the ridiculous cost
of tuition.

Pennsylvania has the second
most expensive public university
system in the country. For some
reason, no one seems to have any
problem with this. There are actual-
ly good things being expressed
about the fact that tuition is only
going up by a little over 3 percent
next year, as compared to the usual
hike. .

I am glad I'm getting out while I
can. When my sister and I graduate
in April, we will both be over

  

$20,000 in debt, which we will
being paying until the end of time.

I guess I shouldn't be upset.
After all, there will be some nice
new buildings here in four or five
years.

Thanks Gov. Ridge. I'm sure
that's enough to get you re—e1ected
and to keep everyone from noticing
the real problems of this university.

Higher cap can ’t

help Steelers
keep Thigpen

Here we go again.

In a sight that has become painful-
ly repetitive over the past five years to
Steelers fans, free agent Yancey
Thigpen signed with the Tennessee
Oilers on Saturday. His $21 million,
five—year contract makes him the high-
est—paid receiver in NFL history.

Heading into the free—agent signing '

period that began last Friday, Thigpen
was considered by many NFL experts
to. be the creme de la creme of the free-
agent receiver class. Last season he
caught 79 passes for 1,398 yards.

But the Steelers were more than
willing to let him go.

The plight of the Steeler organiza-
tion is well known: The team doesn’t
generate enough revenue to stay in the
free-agency game. Maybe it has
enough to ante, but the Steelers fold
because they can’t match the next raise.

But, at least since 1994, the brains
of the front office have drafted so well
and signed the right free agents that the
Steelers have not only stayed atop the
AFC Central but have played in three
of the last four AFC championships.

Big names like Kevin Greene,
Chad Brown, Neil Q’Donnell, Rod
Woodson and Leon Searcy have all left
Pittsburgh for a considerable difference
in pay. When Greene left, Brown and"
Greg Lloyd filled the holes at line-

backer and nothing was lost.'lf any-

thing, the defense was better.
When Brown left for Seattle, a
young Jason Gildon, a free agent this

year, used his speed to put together a.
solid year. The Steelers have had suc-

cess filling holes in the dyke, but will
‘he success continue?

1 The $17.6 billion, eight—year TV
ontract the NFL just signed is expect-
11 to raise the salary cap by $10 mil-
on for each team. Now teams will
ave more money to spend on keeping
reir free agents.

.In the world of sports ﬂrere two types
of losses. 1

Type A is the royal whipping; the type
where a team gets its insides handed to it on
a platter — right after its opponent rips them
out with a fork (see Pitt—Ohio State football,
1996). A type A loss is degrading and
humiliating. , ‘

Then there’s type B — the stupid mis-
takes, bad-bounce, had—the-win-in-your-
grasp type (see Pirates-Braves game 7,
1992 NLCS). A type B loss wrenches at
your insides in a diﬁerent way. After a type ,
B loss, you don’t feel like you were beaten,
you just want to press the reset button.

Irish stay unbeaten vs. Panthers 6
Toney, Chastang lead Pitt

Shannon Heim

Staff Writer

. Last year, the matchup between the
Lady Panthers’ basketball team and the
Fighting Irish of Notre Dame ended in a
16 point Irish victory. Yesterday in South
Bend the margin of victory was decreased
 by one point. Pittsburgh lost the battle,
75-60.

In this contest, the Lady Panther team
started no seniors, with junior Gina
Montesano at forward, sophomores center
Nickeia Morris and guard Michelle
Katkowski, and freshmen Monique Toney
at guard and Kenosha Chastang at for-
ward.

The first half saw Pittsburgh connect
on 11 of 24 field goals and four of six free
throws. The Panthers successfully com-
pleted the only attempted three-pointer of
the half, and ended the first period trail-
ing Notre Dame by only four points, 27-
31.

THE PITT NEWS

The young team ended the match with
a total field-goal shooting percentage of
43.8 percent, 65.2 percent from the free-
throw line, and 3 for 3 in three-point bas-

kets. They outshot the Irish — who’

totaled a field goal percentage of only
36.9 percent and were a mere 27.8 percent
in three-point attempts — but lost.

The leading Lady Panther scorer was
Toney, who totaled 11 points and also
contributed four assists and two rebounds.

Following close behind Toney was
Chastang. The freshman forward finished
with 10 points, two assists and added
eight rebounds. ,_

Contributing a team—high 10 boards
was Morris, the sophomore center. She
also added nine points and a game-high
seven blocks. '

The Lady Panthers’ next matchup will
be at Rutgers on Wednesday, Feb. 18.

They will then end their regular season at

make sure all damages/deﬁciencies
are noted and get a copy of the
lease signed by the landlord. In
addition, check with the Better

Business Bureau to see if they have

any complaints on file against your

prospective landlord or rental
agency.

THE [N’S AND OUT’S OF
SUBLETTING I

To sublet (sublease) is to lease to
another person, a house or apart-
ment which is alreadyibeing leased
to you. In legal terms, the landlord
is the lessor,- the tenant is the lessee
and the sublessee is renting from
the lessee.

SUBLETTING YOUR
APARTMENT

Check your lease. Are you permit-
ted to sublet and if so, what steps or
procedures must be followed. Are
you required to notify your landlord
in writing of your intention or to
have the landlord approve any
prospective sublessors? If your
lease does not say anything about
sublets, it is generally assumed that
you can sublet?

Meet with your landlord. Discuss
your intentions, gain approval and
clarify the process. Will your land-
lord permit you to terminate your

lease without penalty. if .you locate.  

THE PITT NEWS 1998 RENTAL GUIDE

   

someone to assume your lease or
accept a new lease. This is prefer-
able for most students. If you plan
to return to the apartment after a
short time (1-6 months) or before
your lease expires, it might be bet-
ter to sublet and maintain your
claim on the apartment for your
return.

If you sublet your apartment,_ real-
ize that you are-for all intents and
purposes-a landlord! You will need
to establish, ‘collect, document, and
account for a security deposit. This
is necessary to protect yourself but
imposes legal obligations on you

‘ just as they do for your landlord. .

You will need a lease agreement, in

_ writing, to protect yourself from

any actions or problems or legal
actions brought by YOUR tenant.
An oral agreement is binding in
Pennsylvania but is subject to mis-
understanding and challenges in
court. You will still be responsible
for paying rent and if your tenant is
supposed to pay your landlord
directly, you are responsible for any
missing or short payments and/or
late fees. You will be responsible
for any damages to the unit and you
may be responsible for unpaid utili-

i ty bills, telephone charges and

cable TV f_ees_. Leasing and security
deposit forms and explanations are

available on the intemet, public and
university libraries, and bookstores.

Realize that the actions of your ten-
ant may also affect you. Tenant
damage to the unit, building, com-
mon areas or systems may result in
legal action against you to collect
damages. Legal action may also be
required for you to collect damages
from your sublessee. Unintentional
damage, sucha ﬁre or ﬂood, of the
unit or building may make the unit
uninhabitable. Who is responsible
for paying damage costs and related
tenant expenses?

Whenever possible, the Housing
Resource Center recommends that
students terminate their lease with
their landlord, have the sublessor
sign a new lease with the landlord,
recovertheir security deposit, and
have no further legal obligations or
liability to the landlord or the new
tenant. 

Looking for a Sublet Apartment?
For all intents and purposes, sublet-
ting andleasing are identical. You
are the lessee and should be famil-
iar with the requirements and stan-
dards of both lessors but that is
only slightly more complicated than
a traditional lease agreement. The
advantages of subletting are that
you may be able to sign a lease
shorter than 12 months and you
may be able to pay a discounted
rental rate. In most rental communi-
ties and university student housing
areas, leases are for 12 months. If
you only need an apartment for one

. semester or during the summer, a
_ sublet can be ideal. Even if the

landlord becomes the lessor, the
length of the lease can be negotiat-
ed for the duration of the original
lease term if you wish. While the

rental rate agreed to by the ‘landlord '

and original tenant is customary for
the sublet, it may be possible to
negotiate a discount. Remember, if
the unit is not sublet, the original
tenant is responsible for paying the
rent for the remainder of the lease
term. This can be a signiﬁcant
incentive to negotiate.

Subletting an apartment is a legal
relationship. Know your rights and
obligations. Document your discus-
sions and all agreements. Be a
knowledgeable "consumer, a good
tenant and an informed landlord.
For more information, call or visit
the Housing Resource Center in
person or on the intemet. To list a
sublet or to check available sublets,
access the Housing Resource
Center Sublet Listings on our web
site or visit our office.

The Housing Resource Center staff
are not lawyers and can not give
legal advice. The preceding infor-
mation ispresented to clarify and
educate members of the university
community regarding this topic. If
you have a question about the legal

_ aspects of leasing, legal remedies or

speciﬁc circumstances, be sure to
consult an attorney.

TENANT’S RIGHTS

The most common landlord prob-
lem in the community are those
involving the making of repairs and

_ the returning of the security

6

deposit. Other less frequent prob-

lems include interferences with the
tenant’s “quiet enjoyment” rights,
unarmounced and frequent inspec-

tions, and the like.

Written notice to the landlord of
any problem is essential. In this
way, you can prove, in court, if
necessary, that such a problem
existed and the landlord had knowl-
edge of it. If the landlord makes no
effort to correct a problem, you
may try alternative methods, i.e.,
rent withholding or suing the land-
lord in small claims court. See rent
withholding for more information.

QUIET ENJOYMENT RIGHTS
What is quiet enjoyment? It means
that you have the right to peaceful
possession of the property. Your
landlord cannot interfere with this
irrevocable right, which is in every
lease - written or oral. When a
landlord wrongfully evicts, shuts
off utilities, locks you out, fails to
supply agreed utilities, or otherwise
interferes with your rights - then
the landlord is violating your right
to “quiet enjoyment”.

After the landlord violates your

THE PITT NEWS 1998 RENTAL GUIDE

“quiet enjoyment” right, you must
continue to pay rent but you may _
sue the landlord for actual damages.
Also, if your landlord ever sues you
for money, and has ever violated
your rights to quiet enjoyment, you
may ﬁle a counter—suit against your
landlord.

A tenant’s evaluation of the serious-
ness of the conditions and decision
to move out could be subject to
judicial review if the landlord sues
for the remaining rent due under
the term of the lease.

Furthermore, under the doctrine of ’
“constructive eviction”, the tenant
may have the right to move out of
the premises and not be obligated
for the remaining rent. Such a “con-
structive eviction” means that the
landlord has, by his behavior (i.e.,
breach of quiet enjoyment failure to
perform duties of the lease, etc.)
implicitly “canceled” the lease.
Thus, the tenant is permitted to
move out.

It should be remembered that this
should be a last resort and should
only be implemented where a ten-
ant feels a suit in court would not

bring satisfactory relief. A tenant
should always give ample notice of
his intent to vacate and the reasons
why. This should be in writing and
a copy should always be kept.
Then, if the conditions continue and
are serious enough, the tenant may
vacate.

RENT WITHHOLDING

Rent withholding does not mean
that you don’t have to pay rent. It is
a system whereby you pay your
“rent” into an escrow account at a.
local bank, in order to force your
landlord to uphold his responsibili-
ty. To do this, you must call the
Allegheny County Health’
Department and request that an
inspector visit your apartment at a
mutually convenient time. Make
sure you have a thorough list of
complaints ready, and that the
inspector ﬁles them in his report.
Before the inspector leaves, you
have the right to know whether you
qualify. You should request that a
copy of the inspector’s report be
sent toyou. If you qualify, you will
receive a certiﬁed letter from the
Health Department, stating that
your unit is unﬁt for human
habitation, and that you may open

Monday, 16 February 1998

an escrow account at the bank. Go
to the Health Department, get an
escrow account card, and take this
card to the bank with you. You
must now remain currentin your
rent payments and write your
account number on each check to
insure credit. The Inspector will
return periodically to your apart-
ment to see if repairs are being
made. If within six months from the
date of the original letter from the
Health Department, repairs are not
completed, you are entitled to a full
refund of your escrow payments.
You and your landlord have the
right to appeal for 30

days after the six month period.

DON’T GIVE UP

Another remedy you have is to
make repairs yourself and deduct
the cost from your rent. This
“repair and deduct” concept is not
viewed very favorably by the
courts. You should only do this
when the landlord had promised to
make repairs, but repeatedly has
failed to do so, or when it is neces-

’ sary to prevent further injury to _
p property. If you “repair and deduct”

be sure to keep all receipts. Make
several copies and send one to your

landlord. By doing this, you will be
protected should your landlord
decide to sue you. You must prove
that repairs were made, that they
were necessary, that the costs were
reasonable, and that they were com-
pletely made. An alternative to

this is that you may continue to pay
rent, and sue your landlord to have
the repairs made, or sue to recover
part of the rent already paid (since
the property can be assumed to be
worth less than the full

rent).

SUING YOUR LANDLORD

If you have a complaint against
your landlord and wish to recover
less than $8,000 excluding court
costs, use the District Justice. If
you are suing for more than $4,000

the person or business you want to
sue, the amount, and a short state-
ment about why you think you are
entitled to the money. You must
provide information so that the
party being sued will know the
nature of the suit.

You may sue for all expenses which
are a result of your complaint.
Court fees range from $18.00 to
$35.00. After ﬁling a complaint, the
clerk will tell you when to come
back for the hearing, generally
between 3 and 4 weeks. The party
being sued must receive a copy of
the complaint before the hearing; it
can be sent by certiﬁed mail or
hand delivered by the sheriff (an
additional fee which can be includ-
ed in the amount for which you
sue). Having the sheriff deliver it is
more effective, because the party
usually can’t avoid him. At the
hearing, have any relevant docu-
ment and witnesses (if possible)
who will back up your story.

A LAST WORD

It should be remembered that as a
class, landlords are no more “evil”
than tenants. Often times disputes
develop simply from the mutual

distrust between tenant and land-
lord and their conﬂicting interest.
That is why a well-written lease is
essential between a lessor and
lessee. When the rights and duties
of each party are in writing, both
can rest easier knowing exactly
what they must do and can expect
to receive in return.

Court action is never the most
desirable means to settle disputes.
Often times disagreements arise
from misunderstanding of the
agreement itself, and as such, all
grievances should always be settled
informally if possible. If informal
settlement cannot be attained, the
lease is often the tenant’s weapon
in court.

Either way, the lease is essential. to
a proper understanding of the roles
"tenant and landlord are to play.-As
such, every potential tenant should
be sure to read and understand the
content of the agreement.

Before you sign the lease, put all
agreements you reach with the
landlord in the lease, make note of
all listing deﬁciencies, and make I

sure you have an extra copy signed '

GUIDE TO THE.LEASE'
AGREEMENT

A Lease Agreement is a contract,
either written or oral, giving you
(the Tenant—Lessee) the use of prop-
erty for a speciﬁc time (usually 6-
12 months). The Lease will usually
contain other conditions, such as,
who pays for utilities, are pets and
sub-letting permitted? There are of
course, many other provisions
which vary according to each
Landlords’s speciﬁcation.

Although the Lease itself may be
written or oral, it should be kept in
mind that both are legally binding.
The disadvantage of the latter is the
Landlord may attempt to demand
performances not part of the origi-
nal Lease, and it is often difﬁcult
for the Lessee to prove such agree-
ment exist. The duration of an oral
contract is limited to not more than
three years. On the other hand, an
oral lease is a month to month lease
and only requires a 30 day notice
when vacating. In spite of these
advantages, it is generally recom-
mended that you should avoid an
oral lease simply because verbal

agreements have a tendency to
result in misunderstandings and you
may lose out in the long run. You
should always request a written
lease which evidences the original
agreement.

Standard Form Lease

There are many types of written
leases, the standard form lease
however, is a printed form includ-
ing the specific major clauses that
make for a tight lease; in other
words, a legally binding contract.
Most landlords use this standard
form lease and simply print in the
blanks provided —— the landlord’s
name, your name, the amount of
the security deposit and the terms
of the lease.

Despite the fact that this type of
lease is formal and binding, it has
advantages to you. It assures that
the rent can be only increased by
the conditions set forth in the lease.
Moreover, an inclusive lease states
in clear language what conditions
both the tenant and the landlord
must follow. The written lease
guarantees the tenant can only be
evicted for violations speciﬁed in

the lease.

There are, of course, disadvantages.

. You should be careful and read all

fine print even if it means using a
magnifying glass, for many clauses
seem slanted in favor of the land-
lord. One such clause usually states
that you cannot move until the term
of the lease ends without incurring
penalties, i.e., forfeiture of security
deposit or a month’s rent.
Remember, once you sign the lease,
you are bound by its conditions.

Private Agreements

For those of us uncomfortable with
formal documents, there is a
“homemade” lease. This lease is an
informal agreement that simply
states the terms and conditions of
the lease on paper. A homemade
lease of this nature is less rigid and
contains fewer clauses that favor
the landlord than the standard lease.

Despite the advantages of a “home-
made” lease, the tenant should
make sure the agreement drawn up
by the landlord contains no ambi-
guities or misunderstandings with
respect to the responsibilities to
each.

THE PITT NEWS 1998 RENAL GUIDE

 

THE LEASE ITSELF

Before signing your lease, you
should understand the terminology.
You, the tenant, are the lessee, the
landlord is usually referred to as the
lessor. If the address and phone
number of the landlord is not
included in the lease, you should be
sure to get the information when
the lease is negotiated.

The following is a list of the most
common conditions contained in
standard leases. Any leasee should
be at least familiar with their mean-
ing and the rights and duties which
they create for the tenant.

Security Deposit

You may be required to pay a
deposit to account for any damages
created by you or your failure to
pay rent. The amount of money a
landlord may require as a security
deposit during the first year of any
lease is limited to two months’s
rent, and during the second or sub-
sequent years is limited to one
month’s rent.

Landlords are required to maintain
security deposits which exceed
$100 in an escrow account. For

 

security deposits held more than
two years, the tenant is entitled to
the interest on the returned security
deposit.

When you enter into a lease agree-
ment, make a complete list of all
damages (even the most minor
damages) and submit this to your
landlord. Make sure you keep a

Monday, 16 February 1998

copy for your records. The landlord _

must agree to the specifics of the
damage list. If you don’t make a
list, you run the risk of eventually
being charged for doing that which
you did not do. Ask for assurances
that the security deposit will be
placed in escrow to guarantee the

fund will be available upon termi—p j 

nation of the lease.

Section 512 of the Landlord—Tenant 

Act of 1951 provides that your «
landlord must return full security
deposit within 30 days, or supply

you with a written, itemized, list of A

damages caused by you plus the
balance of your deposit. You, the
tenant must leave your landlord a
forwarding address in writing, and
pay the last month’s rent.

bilities, you may only be entitled to
the original deposit. This 30 day
period begins upon the expiration
of the lease or when you (the ten-
ant) give possession back to the
landlord.

Duration of the Lease
You should always be aware of the
duration of the terms of the lease.

L Such a clause Should state when it
begins and how long it will last. It ‘
. could be month to month, year to

year, or simply a “School-year”
lease.

A month-to-month lease usually
gives you rights to the apartment
for 30 days and is renewed each
month by continued occupancy. A
30 day notice is required prior to
termination. The year-to-year lease,
on the other hand, obligates the ten-

L ant and landlord for one calendar

year and rent is usually paid in
monthly installments. The tenant

‘Should be aware that continued

occupancy, even for only a few

days past the termination date, may

«obligate the tenant to an additional

,year’S rent payment. The school-

year leases are the same except the

"tenant and landlord are only oblig-

 

ated for 9 months or the length of
the school year.

Rent

A tenant should always be careful
that the lease states the amount of
money due, and when payment
Should be made. Without a rent
amount in the agreement the tenant

may be faced with the landlord’s A .
' attempts to unjustly increase pay-

ment.

Furthermore, the tenant should be
careful to note any penalties which
the lease may contain for late pay-
ment. Some standard leases will A
permit the landlord to demand the
entire amount due, i.e., the number
of months remaining, as an assur-
ance for the late payment. Such a
clause is known as the rent acceler-
ation clause. Often leases contain a
forfeiture clause which allows the
landlord to treat the lease as
breached for late payment. See sec-
tion on rent withholding for further
information.

Repairs

Generally, unless a lease provides
otherwise, the landlord may enter
your property to inspect or make

 

THE PIT NEWS 1998 RENTAL GUIDE

repairs. A time and date arrange-
ment between you and your land-
lord would be the most preferable
method. Your landlord may only
inspect and make repairs at reason-
able times.

. If your landlord comes at an unrea-

sonable time, you can ask him to
come back at a time more conve-

nient for you. If he persists in com- .

ing at unreasonable hours, you may

' bring action against your landlord

before the Justice of the Peace. If
the making of repairs necessitates
your moving out, even if only tem-
porarily, your responsibility to pay
rent is suspended for that time.

If your landlord is not making
repairs as quickly as you would
like, you cannot (according to cur-
rent Pennsylvania Law) automati-
cally withhold rent. There have
been times when tenants in slum
housing withheld their rent, and
were subsequently evicted for not
paying rent. The law can protect
your rights, but you must use it to
your ‘advantage. If the landlord
won’t put it in writing or refuses to

repair, send a letter to your landlord ’

explaining the repairs agreed to, or

  

state the repairs the landlord Should
make. Say in the letter who is to
make the repairs, when they are to
be made, and who

will pay for them. Most important,
keep a copy.

Subletting and Assignment
Sublet means to lease or rent all or
part of a leased or rented property
to another person. Assignment
means transfer of property.

The tenant should make sure to .
understand these conditions. Many
leases limit the tenant to use the
property only as a residence.

_ "Restrictions on either sub—letting or
' assignments are enforceable by the

landlord. If nothing in the lease
prohibits you from sub—letting or
assigning the lease you may do so.

Distraint .
Another clause to look for is dis-
traint which allows the landlord to
sell the tenants personal property
for non-payment of rent. If this
clause is in your lease, it is now
illegal, but some landlords may
threaten an uninformed tenant with
this illegal device. ’

Lady Bears take eight of nine titles; Panther tennis takes none in season opener

Kindra Wykoff -

Staff Writer

Did Pitt’s women’s tennis team
play anyone else besides Southwest
Missouri State at Pitt’s invitational
this weekend?

It wouldn’t seem that way if you
had seen the final score sheet. It
might as well been Pitt vs.
Southwest Missouri — the Panthers
because they hosted the event, and
the Lady Bears because they took
first place in eight of nine tourna-
ment brackets, losing only the low-
est—ranked singles bracket to
Bucknell University. '

In every match against the Lady
Bears, the Panthers lost, coming
away with no titles in their own
tournament. Pitt placed just two
players in the semifinals, with both
Lindsay Carlson and Amanda
Hoffman losing to a Southwest
Missouri player in the final round.

Pitt Head Coach George
Dieffenbach believes the experience
helped his team become stronger.

“We’re better prepared as a
result of this weekend. There’s a
good sense of unity,” Dieffenbach
said.

to Dieffenbach helps the Panthers
ease into the spring season after
having roughly a two—month break
from play. That’s why Dieffenbach
is such a fan of this event.

“It gives my team a chance to
compete at home,” said
Dieffenbach.

Without the stress of travel, the
players can focus more on what they
have to do to advance to the champi-
onship bracket.

Last year was the first time in
the history of the invitational that
Pitt produced a champion. It had

two. p
' This year, it had none.

But the final score on paper
doesn’t always show what happened
on the court.

Fran Davis had a very strong
showing against Southwest’s Olga
Rembielinska, even though Davis
lost 6-3, 6-1. .

“Rembielinska was a tough play-
er, but Davis hung in there and was
aggressive,” Dieffenbach said.

A nice surprise for Dieffenbach
was the play of iPitt’s No.-9 seed
Kim Nikelwicz against Kori Nicol,

vzamwzrx

one of Duquesne’s top players.
Nicol won, but was unable to shut
out Nikelwicz, taking a 6-1, 6-0 win.

Pitt freshmen sensations Carlson
and Dana Jafarian both continued to
live up to their top billing.

Viktoria Gimberg, the champion
in ﬂight A singles, lost four games
to Jafarian before going on to win. It
was the most games she’s lost in one
match in her career. _

“Gimberg was a national caliber
player. Jafarian played-well against

THE PITT NEWS

Panther LaX downed in double-OT

Matt Townsend
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team was booted out of
their reserved spot in the Cost Center for its game
last Thursday night by a late request of the Carnegie
Mellon women’s tennis team. However, Pitt
Stadium was open and Pitt Head Coach Rob Heaps
found the light switch. “It’s really been tough
trying to get a ﬁeld reserved,” said Heaps. “We’ve
been here for 14 or so years and never had a prob-
lem, but this year has been different. It seems like
the athletic department doesn’t care- about us.”

Despite the change to a freezing venue, 100
fans and Pitt’s pep band showed up to watch a dou-
ble—over1ime 14-13 loss to St. Vmcent’s College in
Pitt’s ﬁrst game of the year.

“It was freezing,” said captain Steve Love.
“This game really didn’t mean much to our season
because they aren’t in our league.”

St. Vincent is a NCAA Division H scholarship
teamandoneofthebesttearrisPittwillplayall
year.

“It’s a great thing to go out and start with a
stronger team,” said Heaps. “It was a positive game
for us despite the loss.”

The focus of this game was to get necessary
experience for the younger players and some prac-
tice playing together as a team, which hasn’t been
happening on a regular basis because of cancella-
tions.

“This game really wasn’t that important, so we
tried some things,” said Heaps. “I made sure every-
one was playing, including both goalies.”

Pitt led the game by three or more goals in both
the ﬁrst and second halves and was up by two

scores with three minutes to play. But after a couple
of penalties sat out two defensive starters, younger
players came in and turned the ball over which led
to both the equalizing scores. I

“We had a couple of problems on defense,”
said Love. “Some of the freshman guys were a lit-
tle timid out there, but that will go away with time.”

After St Vincent tied the score with seconds to
play, Pitt thought it won the game a little later, but
the goal was disallowed. A difference in rules of the
two governing leagues caused the discrepancy.

On the goal in question, the oﬂicial ruled that
the ball was not in the net before whistle sounded.
In St. Vmcent’s NCAA rule book, for a goal to be
true it must be in the net before the ﬁnal whistle.
But, in Pitt’s National Collegiate lacrosse league,
if the ball is released before the whistle is sounded
then the goal is good. Before the game the teams
agreed to play Pitt’s riﬂes for the ﬁrst and third quar-
ters and St. Vmcent’s for the second and fourth,
hence the goal didn’t count.

In the ﬁrst, sudden-death, ﬁve-minute over-
time Pitt dominated play, but couldn’t ﬁnd the net
and a second overtime was forced

“We had everything going for us, but we just 4

didn’t get the good shots we needed,” said Love.

A couple of minutes into the second overtime
backup goalie John McGrath stopped a ﬁrst shot,
but a St. Vincent player scooped in the rebound" to
end the game.

“If this was a big game we would have gone
out and won it,” said Heaps. ‘

Marc Poleciitti led all scorers with ﬁve goals
and two assists, and Pat Shea scored a hat trick

before an injury slowed him
down. Last year’s third—down
specialist, Courtney Flowers, is
also an option.

The Steelers will probably
look to the draft as well, but it
won’t replace the loss of
Thigpen’s experience. He was
Kordell Stewart’s go—to guy and
more than made up for Charles
J ohnson’s lackluster performance
last year.

So, the Steelers are left with
C.J. and either a rookie, a sec-
ond-year player or a converted
third—down specialist to catch
balls for a second-year quarter-
back.

Hope it works. _

And it probably will, but that

. doesn’t explain why the Steelers

always fail to re—sign homegrown
players while their competition
does. -

The Patriots have already
signed their best offensive line-
man, Bruce Armstrong, and pass
rusher, Willie McGinest. The
Packers kept wide receiver
Robert Brooks and linebacker
Brian Williams._ Even the" finan-
cially strapped Bengals were able
to sign wideout Damay Scott.

But let’s just be thankful that

the market than anybody else.

But the Packers, unlike ‘the
Steelers, have already signed
their top receiver in Brooks.

For the Steelers, losing
Thigpen was expected, but sign-
ing Steed is crucial. He is the
anchor of a defense that didn’t

Perhaps the Steelers will re-

their younger players will ﬁll the I.

But wouldn’t it be nice if, for 5

League champion and feature 10 nationally
ranked grapplers.

Weird things seem to happen on Friday
the 13th.

The difference in this bout was the four
“swing matches” —— those individual match-
es between wrestlers of fairly equal talent
that could go either way. The Mountaineers
came away the victors in each match.

“We win one of those matches and
we’re talking about all the great things we
did,” Pitt Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer
said.

The Panthers looked strong overall,
beginning with Rob Loper and his 22-7 win
in the 126-pound class. Nick Mengerink
wrestled to a 7-0 shutout at 167, and All-
Americans John VVrthrow (177) and Mark
Bodo (190) turned in winning performances.

The only weight classes in which the
Mountaineers appeared to wrestle better than
Pitt were 134 and 150, where nationally
ranked Whitey Chlebove and Mike Mason
cruised to victories.

It was the close losses at 118 (5-4), 142

killed the Panthers.

But despite trailing 15-5 after the 158-
pound weight class, Panthers Bodo,Withrow
and Mengerink battled back to cut the
Mountaineer lead to 15-14 heading into the
heavyweight class.

Pitt’s Matt Mueller physically dominat-
ed WVU’s Vince Pellis, and led 3-2 most of
the match. But with nine seconds left, Pellis
managed a takedown to give him a 4-3 lead

and give WVU the win. The Mountaineer’

crowd erupted into a frenzy as the home
team stormed the mat to hug Pellis. The
Panthers stood silent, staring in disbelief.

Penn State 16, Pitt 15

After an emotionally crushing loss to
WVU, one might have expected the
Panthers to come out ﬂat against ﬁfth—ranked
Penn State on Saturday.

But the Panthers showed why they’ve
ﬂirtedwithanational top-l0rankingallyear,
and were once again a “could have” away
from a victory.

“I really don’t think last night’s loss [to
WVU] affected how we wrestled today,”
Stottlemyer said. “We had a great crowd

and had a chance to beat PermiState, but we
didn’t get the job done.”

Penn State’s seventh—ranked Jeremy
Hunter dominated at 118 to give the Nittany
Lions an early 40 lead, but it was Loper"s
performance at 126 that sparked Pitt and
energized the Fitzgerald Field House crowd

Twelftlr-ranked Loper and 10tl1-ranked
Jason Betz traded escapes to leave ﬂre match
tied at one after regulation. That sent the
match into a .ﬁrst—takedown-wins, two-
minute overtime period But neither vvresﬂer
managed to score, sending the match to dou-
ble overtime.

In double overtime, a coin ﬂip deter-
mines which wrestler gets in the down posi-
tion and which starts the period on top. The

bottom grappler has 30 seconds to break free
from his opponent’s grasp.

If he escapes, he wins. If not, he loses.

Loper won the toss and chose tostart on
the bottom. He nearly escaped several times,
but as the clock ticked down it appeared Betz
would claim the victory.

Just as the buzzer rang, Loper spnmg
free from control to eam an electrifying win.
Loper raised his hands in the air and faced
the ﬁenzied crowd of 1,780 Panther fans.

Unfortunately for the Panthers and their
fans, unranked Nittany Lion Bitf Walizer
upset nationally ranked Chad Jesko (134) to
stop the Panther momentum.

“Jesko already beat [Walizer] twice this
year,” Stottlemyer said. “We have no busi-
ness losing that match.”

Fifth-ranked Jamarr Bilhnan’s 6-3 win
at 142 upped the PSU lead to 10-3, before
Pitt’s Brian Partlini captured a win at 150.

“I kept shooting [attempting take-
downs] on him, but he ‘defended really we ,”
Pardini explained “I knew if I could keep
from getting taken down, I could win.”

Third-ranked Clint Musser managed a
7-2winat158 tobringthePennStateleadto
13-6 before Mengaink, VVrthrow and Bodo
grabbed three straight wins, giving Pitt a15-
13 lead heading into the heavyweight match.

“That’s right where we wanted to be
heading into heavyweight,” Stottlemyer
said “They were bumping a guy up [from a
lighter weight class], but we oouldn’t get the
job done.”

This weekend’s losses drop Pitt to 11-5
overall, 4-1 in the EWL. Next up is another
conference clash as 19th-ranked Edinboro
comes to the Field House on Friday night. '

ment may have given the
Panthers a bit of a lift —— even
though Connecticut controlled
much of the game’s tempo, Pitt
was able to hold the Husky lead
to 12 points for most of the first
half.

Cummings, Ricardo Greer
and Isaac Hawkins combined for
32 of the Panthers’ 34 points in
the first half. But Hamilton, who
had five of his 14 first—half
points in the final minute, gave
the Huskies a 48-34 halftime
lead after hitting a three pointer
and coming right back with a
jumpshot on UConn’s next pos-
session.

The Huskies opened the sec-
ond half with a 15-3 run made
possible by Connecticut’s man-
to-man pressure defense. UConn
caused turnovers, turnovers led
to fast breaks, and the fast
breaks led to points — the
Huskies were able to convert 21
points off the fast breaks in the
game.

Once again it was Hamilton
who hit a three pointer that
capped off the 15-3 rally. But the
Panthers fought back with a 13-4
run, led by seven points from

Greer.
The push would be short-
lived, though, as Hamilton

changed the momentum of the
game by hitting two free throws
and starting a 16-4 Husky run.
The run gave the Huskies their
largest lead of the game, 83-54,
with only seven minutes left to
play.

Connecticut finished off the
game as Hamilton, who could
hardly contain his happiness
over his offensive output,
banked a pass off the backboard
to teammate Kevin Freeman,
who then slammed home a dunk
that brought all 15,467
Connecticut. fans to their feet.

Freeman, who played with a‘

bout of theflu, finished the day
with 14 points — third on the
team behind freshman guard
Khalid El-Amin, who had 15.
“Connecticut did an excel-
lent job of distributing the bas-
ketball with 19 assists,” Pitt
Head Coach Ralph Willard said.
“A 12-0 run led by a three-point-
er by Hamilton put them ahead
by 21. They never looked back.”
For the Panthers, Cummings
finished the game with 19
points. Greer also had'a big
game, leading the squad in

points with 20 and finishing _

with 10 rebounds. Isaac
Hawkins had 16 points and 13
boards on the afternoon.

Pitt’s Atilla Cosby was able
to shut down Connecticut under
the boards with a career-high six
blocks. Cosby also scored seven
points.

Cosby hit‘ on five of nine
shots (including three of four
from the foul line), but as a
team, the Panthers had trouble
completing their attempts. Pitt
made only 31 percent of its shots
from the field.

“Connecticut had to rebound
after a tough loss to WVU earli-
er in the week,” commented
Willard on the Huskies’ motiva-
tion. 1
Pittsburgh has had trouble
keeping close against five of its
past six opponents, trailing each
of them by more than 12 at cer-
tain times in each game. Pitt has

lost eight of its last nine games '

and are last in the Big East with
five games left to play.

The loss dropped
Pittsburgh’s record to 8-13 over-
all and 3-10 in the Big East. The
Panthers travel to. Georgetown
on Tuesday night for a Big East
matchup with the game slated to
start at 7:00 p.m. It will be tele-
vised on Fox Sports Pittsburgh.

her,” said Dieffenbach.

Carlson beat Wendy Eason of Bucknell in a
very close match, but then went on to lose to
Southwest Missouri’s Tuva Hegna in the finals.

Pitt’s Jennifer Bible lost in the semifinals
to Asa Duneborn, also of Southwest Missouri.

“Bible had a service break in each set
[against Duneborn]. That’s very respectable,”
Dieffenbach said.

Perhaps the nicest surprise for Dieffenbach
was the comeback of Panther Erin Shalbrack,
who didn’t play at all in the fall due to an
injury. _

“She had the best showing of the tourna-
ment. It was a real close match. It will pay
great dividends in the springtime,” he said of
Shalbrack’s 6-7, 6-2 and 6-2 semifinal loss to
Lady Bear Ilse Norma.

Although Pitt didn’~t produce any champi-
ons from the tournament, Dieffenbach isn’t'
unsatisfied with the way his team performed.

“I’m happy with‘ my players. They always
give 100' percent for me,” said Dieffenbach.
“Tennis is a long-term thing in terms of
improvement,” Dieffenbach said. “I hope we
work hard again next year.”

This weekend of competition helped to
season some of Dieffenbach’s younger players
and gave his more experienced players a tune- I
up. Not only is this good for the women, it’s .;
also good for Dieffenbach, who is looking to ~i
.extend his six-year streak of .500—or-over sea-
sons. ~
