Committee
Holds Meeting

The Student Committee In-
Alcoholic
erages held their initial meet-

vestigating Bev-

ing last Thursday to decide
what areas would be discussed b_y
the committee and how informa-

tion could best be gathered.
The members plan to send let-

ters to the administrations and
student governments of those
campuses where alcoholic bev-

erages are permitted, asking them
where and when they are served,
and what regulations are in effect
concerning fraternity houses and
dormitories.

Richard Sobota, SG president
and chairman of the committee,
said, “We are proceeding in a
fashion, consult-
ing the proper authorities in all
areas where clariﬁcation is need-
ed. We are basing our study on
facts and are not taking for grant-
ed anything in the area of admin-
istrative or student opinions.”

During‘ the meeting commit-
tee members discussed what
they knew about Pennsylvania
laws pertaining‘ to the sale and
serving of alcoholic beverages.
They later decided to study the

laws further.

Mimeographed summations of
the committees ﬁndings will be
made available when the series of
meetings is completed.

Sobota Deems Meeting ‘Sucessful’

Freshmen ‘Meet Their Senators’

Although only 25 students turn-
ed out for the “Freshmen meet
your senators" .1.eeting‘ last
Thursday, Student Government
feels it was successful.

SG president Richard Sobota
said that many of the freshmen
present had indicated that be-
cause the meeting was worth-
while, they would encourage their
friends to attend the next gather-
ing.

Because of the small attendance
the meeting was informal? Stu-
dents discussed problems with SG
officials Pat Teeters, Jay Fingeret,
and Mary Alice Polyak.

The freshmen responded un-
favorably to a recent suggestion
calling for the presidents of the
various campus organizations to
replace SG as the decision mak-
ing body. ‘

Pat Teeters said that SG must
adjust to the trimester system in
order to be a truly representative
body.

Suggested revisions in SG
elections were also discussed as
Jay Fingeret explained to the

freshmen how SG operates and
what their authority and ololiga-.
tions were.

On Problems

By Jim Nelson

Senators from Student Govern-
ment Association met with Fresh-
men Wednesday to discuss cur-
rent student problems and to pro-
mote greater understanding be-
tween freshmen and SG. That is,
they met with twenty freshmen.
Out of a class of about twelve
hundred freshmen men and wom-
en, only one and three quarter
students per every hundred show-

-*ed up at the meeting.

Why did only 1.75 per cent of
the freshmen attend this meeting?
Have the freshmen already be-
come oriented‘ to believe that dis-
cussion of the things that involve
them is unimportant? Do they be-
lieve that their voices and opinions
mean nothing in our massive Uni-
versity? Seldom at the University
of Pittsburgh is anyone’s opinion
asked about anything. Most of us
have learned by now that if
someone higher‘ up asks 0ne’s
opinion, he had better grab the

floor and talk long, fast, and hard,‘

because opportunity to do so is
limit.ed. Student government, the

A touchy theme with many
variations is currently being dis-
cussed in several campus organi-
zations. The theme, an old one, is
that of the traditional good-night

 kiss at the women’s dorms before

dates take leave of each other.
And just as traditional is the
problem of deciding just what a
goodnight kiss consists of before
it becomes outright love-making
in a public place. Everyone, with
morals or no, is familiar with the
goodnight kiss, and although each
has his own ideas about how he
would like it to be, he also has
a strong hint of what society will
accept and a respectable. public
kiss. ,

What could possibly be more

representative. body of stldent
opinion and thinking, ‘asks stu-
dents for an opinion, and they
hear nothing. ‘

I would rather think that the
low attendance
at this meeting
was due to lack
of publicity by
SG than to
think that even ,
freshmen do
not care what
is going on
around them.
Reaching over
twelve hun- ,
dred students is quite a job. I
hope that when the second meet-
ins‘. which is scheduled for
sometime‘ this week, is held, that
Student Government will have
made an all out attempt to in-

Pilltsbu-rgl1 International’ Viewed . . .

Dignified Chaos

By,Ed Robertson
It used to be that trips through the Carnegie
Art Galleries meant an atmosphere of serene dig-

‘ nity, with the most noticeable activity. being the
. mysteriously isolated buzzing of oldladies oﬁ at

the end of the hall. But last week my visit was
more like a voyage to some
exotic Byzantium -— or at least,
an adult penny-arcade. That
statement is not meant to dero-
gate the seriousness of the Pitts-
International, however,
for I left the staid old galleries
with the feeling of having been
truly. intellectually entertained.

In do not mean that I was
entertained by the tasks of rec-
ognizing inﬂuences in a work or
eruditely identifying schools to -
myself. Nor do I mean that I was entertained by
the presumptuous game of interpreting how the ar-
tist felt or what he meant. What I .do mean is
that I felt that It was being informed of new prin-
ciples that now take into consideration the beauty
of irrationalities that the old worship of naturalism
and realism in art was forced to leave out.

Now immediately some of you are prepared to
throw the question of communication to me. But
let me answer by relating a few incidents which I
observed in the galleries.

Child's Play? ,

A“young man coming upon Jose De Rivera’s
Construction No. 72, looked at the gracefully ir-
regular piece of tubing and began telling his wife
of the fun their kids could have on the piece of art-
work. The woman looked obliquely at her husband
and replied, “You won‘t put any of my kids on that
thing; it looks like it’s ready to take off.” Whether
she knewit or not, she had probably interpreted

Orders from Moscow ? ? ? . ’. .

 

Mr. De Rivera’s work exactly as he hadintended:
the piece was anything but static. ‘
In one of the second floor galleries I passed two

 

elegantly-dressed matrons scurrying like children I

in a toy store from one work to the next, bending
over, peeking through the openings and into the
crevices of the sculpture, and sayingwhat fun the
whole thing was. These two women, I think, had
the necessary attitude.
Solemn Insights I V
How many of your great insights have actually
been that profoundly solemn? Certainly not allgof.

them. How many of the world’s great discoveries C

were not, first, merely show oddities? It now comes
to my mind that the solar ‘battery is today demon.
strated as the power behind a kaleidoscope of
aluminum bits. I can easily imagine, somewhere

Red Horizons .

By Barry Gross _

Daniel Rubin, the man who tricked the Inquiry
Club, edits “New Horizons for Youth,” a monthly
newspaper aimed at American high school and
college Through the use of charged
words, 0-pinion-riddled'~"‘news stories” and other
methods of journalistic slanting, ,
he and his staff present warped %
pictures of the Untied States.
According to “New Horizons,”
this is a country where “The
National Review” stands with
the Ku Klux, Klan, Senator
Barry Goldwater is a reaction-
and cultural events are
withheld from our youth be-
cause of exhorbitant prices. .

As Pitt News editor Julie Thomas said in last
editorial, “For

Rubin’s paper, his political leanings are hardly

students.

week’s anyone who has seen

so subtle as to be completely hidden from view.”
He does’ try to hide his leanings, though, by con-
cealing his background from ’ groups’ he asks to
speak to, and by concealing the purpose of his
newspaper by inserting in it harmless articles on
the human brain, used car buying tips, and sports
information. /
Superficially Sane

These articles give the surface impression that
the newspaper isymerely a general sheet which
prints items of interest to T American youth. ‘A
survey of one issue shows twelve, articles on civil
rights, six articles on the U.S. and world affairs,

. and a lead story ona world youth forum. The

survey would lead the casual reader to believe
that the editor is trying to keep his young read-
ers well informed of the dynamic hapenings in
the world which are affecting them.

But a careful study of the tone, fact selection,
word‘ usage, and subject material found in “New
Horizons” ad.ds support to the accusations made
this spring at a Senate Judiciary Committee meet-
ing that editor Daniel Rubin is director of the
Communist Party’s national youth organization in
the United States. . i
’ The lead article on a world youth forum held
recently says: “We heard many times compaints
of virtual occupation of other countries by Amer-
ican troops.” If the phrase “we heard many

times‘ complaints” sounds strange to you, you “will ,
probably wonder,  I did, ‘if  is the result of

 

 

poor word usage or of difficulties encountered in
translating from one language to.-another.

The article also quotes a French representa-
tive to the Forum, “It is to be registered that

there are comparatively few young people from
the USA . '

put it, ‘The absent ones are always to blame’?
Then a lad from Britain bernoans the number of
U.S. military bases on his country’s soil. “You
celebrate the 4th of July as the day of inde-
pendence from Great Britain. On the next 4th of
July, we are looking forward to celebrating our
independence from the United States.”
Cori-oon Comrades -

A cartoon on the editorial page is entitled “On

‘the Same Team,” and shows four baseball play-

e1"_S Standing together. The ﬁrst, labeled “John
Blrcha” is Painting the word “red” on the wall.
The second, wearing a gun, has a swastika for a
face. The third, representing the Young Amer-
icans for Freedom, a favorite “New ,Hc‘:izons”
'E€i1"ge’E, is clutching a copy of the “National Re-
'‘”C“’-” The fourth, hiding under a Ku Klux Klan
hoods is C31‘I‘YiI1g, a hangman’s "noose. For some
reason, the “team’s”_ manager is not shown; Per-
haps he is busy sowing fallout.

In a catch-all editorial, attacking “Dangerous ,-

Crackpots,” Senator Barry Goldwater is placed
“-3900118 the most ractionary elements in the coun-
try-” Evidently, Rubin -feels that Goldwater has
been hiding some unpatriotic and sinister actions
under the guise of conservative statements.‘
Cultural Commodity

_ “What Plfice Culture.” another article, follows
Leomd _K°g3ns the great Soviet concert violinist,
as be gives concerts in Cuba, where ticket prices

tllscrepancy 1n the two country’s standards of
IIVIDE which accounts for the price diﬁerence.
How many hours must a Cuban work to earn the
equivalent of 25 American pennies?

If Mr. Rubin does not receive his orders from

.Moscow, then he is unwittingly’ helping their 1

_CaUSf% by luring those youths genuinely interested
in civil. rights into following his warped pictures
of America. Those who follow his tune will find
themselves‘ being manipulated by the Reds, and

‘WHITEY FORD, the brash
blonde pitcher of New York
Yankee fame. stirred some scotch
and soda absent-mindedly in a
swank cocktail lounge in the Syr-
acuse airport. and said, “Well, I
guess New York really got the last
laugh on Pittsburgh this year."

FOREMOST IN HIS MIND was
the fatal collapse of the Pirates
this year after beating Ford's
Yanks in the World Series in 1960,
but the statement was prompted
by the crushing 28-9 thumping
whichthe Syracuse Orange oi’ up-
per New York had dealt the be-
wildered forces of Pitt in Archbold
Stadium on Saturday afternoon.

THE ANCIENT BOWL looked
as though if was struck by an
earthquake and the Panther forces
were split almost as much by the
powerful thrusts of the Syracuse

West Chester
Bounces Cats’
Soccernieli, 3-1

By LEN BERENFIELD
West Chester State College
continued its march toward

an undefeated soccer season_
Saturday, as the Pitt booters

went down’ in defeat, 3-1. The

victory gives West Chester a
10-0 record for the year. and
makes them a strong contender
to represent their district in the
NCAA tournament. ‘

Despite their many injuries, the
spirited Panther team took the
lead in the first half when Bob
“Corky" Cuthbert tallied. A few
minutes later, the Cats saw vic-
tory begin to fade when Cuthbcrt,
the tcam’s leading scorer, wastin-
jured and forced to leave the
game. However. the Panthers
withstood the West Chester on-
slaught for the remainder of the
half to retain their slim 1-0 lead.

Tide Turns

In the second half, West Ches-
ter controlled both the ball and
the scoring. They tied the game
early in the half with Don Wil-
liams doing the scoring, and later
surged into the lead as Bill Fulk
added two. more goals to clinch
the game.

Once again, as in the past, in-

juries were Pitt’s nemesis. The
team mised the services of Han-
nington Okoth and Alberto
Sichel, both of whom did not
even make the trip due to pre-
vious injuries. The injury to
Cuthbert during the game de-
tracted from the Panther scor-
ing punch, for “Corky”ileads the
scorers with twelve goals in nine
games. As Coach Leo Bemis
stated, “Considering our injuries,
the boys played very well.”

Although the whole squad play-
ed well, several Pitt booters turn-
ed in outstanding performances,
Goalie Tom Staab made an in-
credible thirty one saves during
the course of the game. while
Steve Daniels and Paul Liberati
also stood out.

Last Tuesday, the Jungle Cats
notched a victory, defeating
Grove City. 1-0. Pitt controlled
the ball for most of the game,
ﬁnally scoring when Cuthbert
blasted the ball into the Grove
City net with sixteen mintues left
to play.

“It Goes On..."

 

WHAT MAKES BILLEY RUN?

We were sitting in the soft seats of an airlines bus, traveling
swiftly toward the Greater Pittsburgh Airport, from which we would
ﬂy to SjV'l“dCl.lSe, New York. I was watching Pete Billey. I was watch-
ing him sitting there, studying.

‘rho gauge Colonel Earl (Red) Blaik used to measure a football

‘ player was simple. The boy was either a student or an athlete. He
was dead wrong as ‘far as Billey is concerned. This “student” is a
rock-1-ibbed, relentlessly aggressive kid who cuts down bigger foes
with explosive blocks, a swift, hard-blocking back, who is tougher,
quicker, more intuitively gofted for football, and has a greater zest
for L‘(:li‘Ib€ll' on Pitt’s team. I

Pete peered out of the window a moment, gazing hard at the

I W  ‘ multi-colored foilage of the pass-

ing forest alongside the parkway.
“Lookit them oak trees,” he said to
me. “I’II bet there's lots of squirrels
in ‘em. You know this is the first
time in eight years that I haven’t
been huntin’. -
“I used to go into the woods around

Somerset Country,” he added, “and lay

around in the leaves and fall asleep.

Sometimes I’d look at the squirrels for

hours before I’d start to shoot them.”

I  _ , Billey looked away from the hills and

The Bruismg Gridder back to the printed text.

Shortly afterwards we were at the airport and heading toward
our plane. I walked behind Billey. He has thethick neck and deep
chest 01'. a tackle and the spraddle—gaited walk of a ﬁghter who would
be hard to knock off his feet. And the reserve Pitt halfback is tough
to knock down. Yet he stands only 5’9” and weighs about 170 pounds.

We were on the plane. I was watching Billey again. I was
watching him sit there, studying. The other fellows were play-
ing cards, reading magazines and talking to the hostesses.

I had it all ﬁgured out for. myself. This is a guy, I was thinking
to myself, who is not wasting any time. His Q.P.A. shows it——he has
a 3.4- or thereabouts. Oddly enough, he almost wasn’t admitted to
Pitt. Billey scored low on his college boards and he had to take
them a second time to reach Pitt’s standards

“I wish that they hadn’t told me my 

marks,” Billey told me. “Then I
would've felt that I was on a par with
everyone else. Now I feel inferior. I
only study so hard cause I hafta. I only
have an average I.Q. The other fellas
tell me I get such high grades cause I
study so hard. 'Well, I hafta read the
stuff over and over cause they can read
beter’n me.”

“I only wish that I didn’t worry
so much. I still get so nervous be-
fore a test. I’m scared cause I think A ~ —
that if I quit workin’ so hard, I'm The Intense Student
going to fall hard. I only hope that I don’t ﬂunk anything. I want
to get all my requirements in the ﬁrst two years.

“I'm too tired to study after comin’ down from the hill after
practice every night, and I only get about three or four hours of
homework done anight. I used to get six hours done.

“I’ll really have to cut the books tomorrow night. I have an or-
ganic (chemistry) test on Monday. I’ll probably study from nine
o’clock till three o’clock tomorrow night, and go to ten o’clock Mass
on Sunday.

On the way home, Steve Jastrzemski, who helped recruit the
Hurst gridder, said, “Isn't that Billey a helluva ballplayer? You know
I was talking to him in our ﬁrst scrimmage session of the year, and

he t911S.me ‘just don’t get in my way, Steve.’ Imagine that! Me a
senior and him a newcomer!”

“Did you see him rebound of]? (Ernie) Davis and hit him again?

Navy's highly touted freshmen

continue to roll on undefeated with
a 6-0 ‘card.

The Sailors, ﬂashing four tal-

Injuries Costly
Coach Bill Kaliden cited two
reasons for the loss. “Injuries
forced us to use some players for
almost the entire game. Navy
used four different teams and just
wore our boys down.” Guard
Chuck Dougherty, Halfback Bob
Gaffney, Fullback Bernie LaQuinta
and Center Tom Furjanic were
used only sparingly due to injuries
incurred during the contest.
“Another thing that hurts us,”
the Coach added, “was that we
dropped too many passes when
our receivers were in the clear."
We had a couple of promising
d r i v e s stopped because we
couldn’t hold on to the ball.”
Despite these factors Kaliden
admitted that, “Navy was the best
team we faced this year.” He also
had high praise for the outstanding

Waslo Only 7 Seconds Second

Thin- Clads Beat NYU I

By GERRY M AZO

Coach Carl Rees‘ cross-country team snapped a ten-me1:i2 ’

losing skein and regained some of its lost prestige on Satur-
day, as they upset New York University, 27-28, in the sea-
son’s ﬁnale.

In winning a dual encounter for the first time since the
1960 lid—lifter, the Panther harriers wound up with a 19ﬁ1

ledger of three victories and ﬁwn

dcfeats. Both of this campaign's
previous triumphs occurred in It
quadranglar contest in which Pitt
placed second to Ohio University,
but came in ahead of Bowling
Green ‘and host Kent State.

Jim Brown of NYU took indivi-
dual laurels, as he completed the
Schenley Park course in 22:20.
Pitt’s ace, Steve Waslo, ran al-
most stride for stride with Brown
until the ﬁnal. hill, whcnthe Vio-
lets’ star finally pulled away for
a sevcn—second victory. Both run-
ners’ times are among the best
ever compiled on the Pitt course.

Tarkany Shines A

Bob Tarkany of the Panthers
finished fourth, following the los-
ers’ John Dugan, who came across
the ﬁnish line-in a solid third
place. The plucky Pitt junior, .,a
major disappointment earlier in
the year and recently plagued by
an ankle injury, at last showed
a return to his ﬁne 1960 form.

With NYU leading at‘ that
point, 9-12, the Jungle Cats eked
out their narrow triumph when

Dick Cook and Jon Hart ﬁnished

seventh and eighth, respectively.

“It was a team victory all the
way,” commented a happy Carl
Rees. “I’ve been waiting all sea-
