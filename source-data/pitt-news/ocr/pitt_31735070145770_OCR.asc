University helps city pool resources "it" -°°"°°"$

Tonyjovenitti

Staff Writer ,

When the city and surrounding
municipalities_ come together,

they sometimes meet in Pitt’s .

Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs.

The School hosts the Congress
of Neighboring Communities, or

CONNECT, a groupgthat repre-
sents the 36 municipalities bor-
dering the city. The members
meet wherever they can, usually
in Oakland, to discuss ways to
pool resources so surrounding
neighborhoods and the city can
work together on issues that af-
fect the region.

Last week, City Council unani-
mously voted to allow Pitt to

apply for more state funding so

it can continue to sponsor the
program.

Bill Peduto, the city council-
man for District 8, which includes
parts of Oakland, said CONNECT
will look for ways the city and
its neighbors can share servic-
es, such as emergency manage-
ment services and installing LED

' streetlights.

“If Dormont, Wilkinsburg and
the city are all buying rock salt,
why don’t we all buy rock salt
together?” Peduto asked.

Peduto is working on his mas-
ter’s in public policy and manage-
ment at Pitt. The man in charge

_of CONNECT, David Miller, is

Peduto’s professor.
“The issues that affect the city-
of Pittsburgh are the same that

Pitt said it will try to provide
more aid to Haiti by collecting
crutches, canes, walkers and
wheelchairs.

Steve Zupcic, assistant di-
rector of Pitt’s Office of Com-
munity Relations, said students
and faculty members can drop
off their used crutches, caries,

' walkers and wheelchairs at the

Fifth Avenue entrance of Parran
Hall between 9 am. and 8 p.m.
Feb. 24 and 25.

Volunteers, primarily stu—_

dents. in Pitt’s Graduate School
of Public Health and some faculty
members, will check the items
to make sure they are in good
condition. -
‘Workers from Global Links,
a Pittsburgh-based aid agency,
will also’ check the items before
packaging them and sending
them to Haiti.
“This is a way that so many
of us, regardless of our skills or
ﬁnancial resources, can relieve

the sufferingof those injured by «

the earthquake,” Zupcic said.
Zupcic said he hadn’t seen sta-

tistics, so he didn’t know how

People find compromise between creationism and evolution.

John Manganaro
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

A movie called “Creation” is draw-
ing new attention to an old_debate on
Pitt’s campus.

Released in the United States
late last month, “Creation” depicts
English naturalist Charles Darwin as
he struggles to balance his theory of
evolution withhis marriage to Emma
Wedgwood, his religious wife (and
cousin) whose faith contradicts his
groundbreaking work. The movie
dramatizes the couple’s efforts to
rectify science and faith. In the pro-
cess, it sheds light on the most heated
discussion in contemporary science

ICE, ICE BABY

and theology. _
Greg Voss has observed this issue
ﬁrsthand. Voss is a minister working
with the Christian Student Fellowship,
a nondenominational campus orga-
nization dedicated to helping college
students live in a faith—oriented way.
The movie seems to be kindling
discussion across Pitt’s campus, he
said. Like the Darwin portrayed in
“Creation,” religiously oriented stu-

. dents seek to reconcile their beliefs

in the classroom every day.

Voss said he works closely with
about 30 students at Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon, and the issue of evolution is
often a topic of conversation and con-
cern. But he feels optimistic about the
message behind the new movie as a

way for students to begin reconciling

the clashing ideologies.
“I think students are starting to

~ realize the argument between cre-

ationism and evolution does not have
to be an ‘either/or’ issue,” Voss said.
“Throughout the Bible, in both the
books of Genesis and Romans, we see
that evolution does not necessarily
disagree with God’s larger plan.”
Voss explained that the early sec-

tions of the Book of Romans offers

pertinent insight into the faith end
of the debate. He read one excerpt
of the book: ‘“For since the creation
of the world God’s. invisible quali-
ties — his eternal power and divine
nature — have been clearly seen,
being understoodfrom what -has

gle with theology  

been made so that men are without
excuse,’_” Voss read. “Coming from a
faithful perspective, scripturelikethis
opens up arange ofpossibilities when
it comes to reconciling creationism
and evolution.”

“Many biblical passages show us-
the reason and logic behind evolution
can be yet another expression of the
greatness of God,” he said. “Every cell

in our bodies ——' theway those cells ‘

differ from the cells in trees, fungus
and other animals —— it all points to
something bigger.” '

19th-century and Victorian literature
at Pitt, oiferedasimilar opinion ofthe

and creationism. Helfand has taught

both graduate and undergraduate
courses covering the theory of evo-'
lution in the 19th century. He believes
the debatehas alreadybeen,se_ttled‘in
manywaysvand thatamovielike “Cre-
ation” can further smooth the rift.
“The discussion that went on be-
tween Darwin and his wife is an im-
portant one when it comes to merging
Christian dispensationwithbiological
fact,” Helfand said. “Evolution is an
accepted fact, but there are always
goingto be additions and corrections.
Unless students believe inthe biblical
creation story verbatim, there is no
conﬂict between a belief in God and

.a belief in evolution.”

 Both the Roman Catholic Church
and the Church of England have ac-

cepted the theory of evolution at dif- .

ferent times since Darwin published
“On the Origin of Species,” Helfand
said. He addedthat conﬂict only aris-
es when the Bible is read in a literal

. T sense, apracticethat is less accepted
A today than in the past.

“Att'he end of ‘On the Origin of

~ Species,’ Darwin calls out to young

people to give his theory afair shake,”

- Helfand said. “Darwinnever thought

that he had nailed everything down,
that he had defeated faith, but he did
thinkthat he had found some relevant
explanations for life.” ‘ .

' Despite Helfand’s' ‘ eas, students
of faith still encounter signiﬁcant dif-‘
ﬁculties in science classrooms at Pitt,
Voss said, because many professors
refuse to engage in a give—and-take
conversation that equally addresses.

comparable and should be complementary.”
Stanley Shostak, a retired Pitt biology pro-
fessor, elaborated on the way in which science
and faith can be reconciled, both in and out
of the classroom. Shostak taught courses on
evolution, histology and embryology at Pitt,
and has visited the village of Downe, England,

where Darwin wrote his masterpiece.

“It is very importantto understand that Dar-
winwas not ahero but avery unique scientist,”
Shostak said. “A great deal of what he said still
escapes many biologists./When we get right
down to it, it is very hard foranyone with a
mathematical or biological background to not
see a purpose in living things. Many scientists
see evolution as a replacement for God, but I

don’tthink Darwin meant itto be thatway. His

objective was never to kill God.”

For this reason, it is essential that biology
teachers keep creationism in mind when teach-
ing evolution, Shostak said.

“Just because Darwin views man as a par-
ticular assembly of genes,.a biological cocktail
of selection and interaction, that does not mean
we can reduce the issue to God versus evolu-
tion,” Shostak said. “While the ways in which
creationism and evolution differ are not trivial,
both theories are going after the same tru .”

Pitt student Robert Yon agreed. Yon is a
junior studying history and political science.
He is also the president of Pitt’s chapter of Carn-
pus Crusade for Christ, a group dedicated to
spreading the New Testament across campus.
He ﬁrst heard about the movie through a fellow
Crusade member and thinks evolution can ﬁt
into Christian ideology.

“In my experience, it seems like those people
who are strong atheists and believe complete-
ly in ‘evolution require as much faith as any
Christian,” Yon said. “I see a lot of similarities
between the dogmas thatl think most people
don’twant to admit exist. At the end of the day,
there isn’t a complete fossil record, nor is there
any complete evidence for God. We need to have
faith either way.” -

This fact is vital to any reconciliation be-
tween creationism and evolution, You said.

“A lot of the time there is a misconception
that Christianity and hard science can’t coex-
ist,” Yon said. “But I know a lot of people who
work hand in hand with both. As long as you

— know where you stand on the issue the two can

go together very closely. It’s all about keeping

Understanding stimulus: hardly a waste

What does "$470 billion — 60 percent of the stimulus -— really buy?

 
 
  

Columnist

According to a CNN poll, 54 per— -

cent of Americans believe that the
American Recovery and Reinvest-
ment Act, or “the stimulus pack-
age,” has beneﬁted bankers. Mean-
while, only one-third believes the

/ARRA has beneﬁted the poor, and V

only one_out of four Americans be-
lieves it has beneﬁted the middle

. class. The overwhelming majority

— three out of four — believes at
least half of the stimulus money

has been wasted. ' '

This poll is the most depressing
economic news I’ve heard lately.
It means that very few Americans
have any idea what Congress put
in the ARRA. Once you understand
what’s in the bill, it is impossible
to believe that it beneﬁted bank-
ers but not poor people, and it is

_ unlikely that so many Americans
‘would call half of the package a
“waste.” ’

The following graph illustrates
the ten most expensive items in
the ARRA.

These ten items cost $470 bil-
lion. That’s 60 percent of the stim-
ulus. Obviously, none of this money
went to bankers. That’s why CNN’s

Stimulus < 5

polling director Keating Holland
said, “It’s possible that the belief
that the stimulus bill has helped
abankers and CEOs is due to the
public confusing the stimulus bill
with the various bailout bills.”

Was this money wasted?

ARRA expenditures fit into
three categories:

(1) Programs that directly aid
individuals and families — such
as tax cuts, unemployment pay-
ments, food stamps, COBRA insur-
ance and Pell Grants. To believe
that this money is wasted, you have
to believe that individuals are not

‘ very good at spending money or
that health insurance is wasteful.

(2) Programs that enable states
to stick to their long-term spend-
ing plans — such as the aid to
state Medicaid and public educa-
tion budgets.»Voters deemed these
programs necessary and produc-
tive for decades. Why would they
suddenly have become wastes of

money over the past two years?
Consider that every few years,
Pennsylvanians ask, “How much
do we want to spend ori_f educa-
tion?” The answershould depend
on Pennsylvanians’ priorities and
the commonwealth’s long-term
ability to generate income. No one
would ever propose that it depends
on house prices in Florida and Cali-
fornia or the unemployment ‘rate
in Michigan. But if the recession
forces hamstringed authorities to
lay off teachers, plostponie school
upgrades and cut ﬁnancial aid,
then the education of the common-
wealth’s children really" does de-
pend on such arbitrary factors.
(3) Programs that fund speciﬁc
projects — such as highway con-
struction, medical records tech-
nology, Smart Grid upgrades to

the electricity grid, broadband for-

rural areas, public transit upgrades
and tax credits for wind turbines.
This category amounts for much

of the spending not listed in the
graph. This spending is doled
out in small amounts to myriad
causes. . T V
It’s common sense that fast and
complicated projects invite waste.
But this whole category only com-
poses a fraction of the ARRA. And
the waste is often counterbalanced

by huge gains on worthy projects. '

The $11 billion for a Smart Grid, for
example, is desperately needed,

. unless you think its ﬁne that un-

clipped trees in;0liio can induce an
economic paralysis as severe as_tl:ie
Northeast Blackout of 2003. .
There’s a perception tliatdthe
entire ARRA was devoted to the
third category. Rush Limbaugh,
for example, recently argued for a
hybrid stimulus plan: “... under the
Obama—Limbaugh Stimulus Plan
of 2009, 54 percent of the $900
billion — $486 billion ’— will be
spent on infrastructure and pork

o as deﬁned by Mr._,Obama and the

Democrats; 46 percent -— $414
billion — will be directed toward
tax cuts.” '

The phrase “infrastructure
and pork” implies that the ARRA
only funds construction projects.
That’s a plain falsehood. While it is
easy to believe that unions forced
Democrats to spend all the money
repaving roads, that narrative is
more story than history.

Why isn’t the ARRA working?

The ARRA did a good job of
stimulating spending — i.e., grow-
ing the GDP. And the ARRA did
a good job of preventing human
misery — i.e., keeping people fed,
housed, healthy and educated. But
it hasn’t stymied unemployment.
So, it’s two for three.

This recession has been a per-
fect storm for employment: A hous-
ing bubble bursting causes lots of

job losses in construction, which
is an especially labor-intensive
activity. And the places where job

. losses are worst are, by deﬁnition,

also places with rapid declines in
housing prices, which makes it al-
most impossible for unemployed
workers to sell their houses and
move to places with jobs. It’s hard
to imagine a government policy
that would reverse such a vicious
cycle. Maybe the best we can do is
to stimulate the economy gener-
ally and help people ride out the
storm.

Of course, the ARRA isn’t per-
fect. There will be outrageous
instances of waste. Employed
workers ended up saving most of
the $116 billion in tax credits they
received. Not enough money went

toward encouraging private-sector '

employers to hire. But believing
the ARRA could have been better
is very different from believing it
was a bad idea to pass the bill.

it is a big leap to support nuclear

INTERVIEW

City Paper music editor moonlights solo

Bethie Girmai
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Aaronjentzen is all over the Pitts-

burgh music scene. As a musician
and a music journalist, he’s in it,
on it, writing about it and writ
ing for it. V

Jentzen made a name for
himself as the music editor for
the Pittsburgh City Paper, but
his most recent vocational en-
deavor cultivates his passion for
performing music rather than
writing about it.

Jentzen, who compares him-

self to artists like Nick Cave,

Scott Walker and David Sylvian,
said that as a musician critiquing
other artists, the dynamic is dif-
ferent than it might be for some-
one who just critiques music and
doesn’t write or produce it.
“For me, being a musician
myself —-having some under-
standing of the processes that
go into making a record or play-
ing a—show — makes me a little
bit more understanding of what
that’s about,” Jentzen said. “But
at the same time, I’m not writing

critiques for musicians to read.
They’re for more general audi-
ences.” .

He said, he chooses his words
very carefully with other local
artists for fear that they don’t
have his experience with me-
dia. C

Though he initially moved to
Pittsburgh because of a girlfriend,

but he stayed for the Pittsburgh’s ‘

art and music scene.
“The affordability of living

here gives things a different qual— ,

ity,” he said. “You can be adven-
turous in some ways you can’t
in this competitive engagement
with every other band in town.”

Jentzen said the mellow at-
mosphere of the music scene in

Pittsburgh attracted him to the

city. , .

It wasn’t long before jentzen
began recording music with his
band, Chalk Outline Party, in
2003. A

TELEVISION REVIEW

HBO misses with new Big Apple drama

Kieran Layton
A/E Editor

“How to Make it in America”
Starring: Bryan Greenberg, Vic-
tor Rasuk, Lake Bell

Creator: Ian Edelman

HBO

Sundays, 10 p.m. .

Grade: C+

In 1998, Darren Star created
a series for HBO that took New
York and turned it into one of the
glossiest, most fabulous charac-
ters on television. That show was
“Sex and the City,” and aside from
making the Cosmopolitan the of-
ﬁcial drink of tourists wishing
to emulate Carrie Bradshaw, it
brought New York into the lime-
light — millions of viewers from
Anchorage, Alaska, to Portland,
Maine, saw the Big Apple in a
new light: one tinted pink with
glitter.

Now, in 2010, another HBO

show is trying to emulate that
shifting mass perception effect,
except it’s been updated to reﬂect
the poor state of the economy. Un-
fortunately, everything about the
show — at least its pilot —- is just
mediocre. For now, New York is’
going to remain untouched.

“How to Make it in America”,

concerns itself with a group of 20-
somethings who all fall withinthe
range of desperately broke and
struggling to get by. Ben; (Bryan
Greenberg) is a jeans salesman
who sometimes moonlights as
an illegal street vendor ofﬂstolen
goods with his buddy Carri (Victor

Rasuk). But what he really wants .

to do is graphic and fashion de-
sign. Of course he does — he is
young and struggling and living in
Manhattan. If it weren’t for having
his own jean line, he would want
to be a writer. ’
Also circulating in his social
periphery is Gingy (Shannyn Sos-
samon), a previous trust fund brat

who strives to maintain ﬁnancial
independence and run an art gal-
lery. Of course she does — nothing

most. -
The show’s ﬁlming style makes
it often resemble pseudo-reality

like some offsetting of the wealthy
guilt to round out the show’s cast
of oh—so-urban pretty actors.
There is the “Dork From High
School” who sold out and man-
ages a hedge -fund (Eddie Kaye‘
Thomas), and there is the beau-
tiful ex—girlfriend (Lake Bell) of

Ben’s, who also appears to be the ‘

one that has her sh*t together-the

shows like “The Hills” and “The
City.” When the characters are on

the screen, you almost expect the ‘
white captioning. to let you know '

which character is exchanging
witty banter, and whose “friend”
they are. Hell, you almost expect
a Whitney Port appearance.

The show isn’t horrible by any
means. It’s produced by the same

team that did “Entourage.” The
writing, acting and production
values are all there. The problems
lie in the concept. 0

high-paying jobs would be ideal.
A show about someone who has to
buy stolen leather jackets and ped-
dle them to tourists? I don’t think
so — those tourists are probably
still lost in the decadence of the
“Sex and the City” image of New

York, not the muted reality of _

“How to Make it in America.”

And though I will have to give
the show a few more episodes to
redeem itself, for now, I’ll stick
with the tourists.

ite instrument to play, although he-initially
felt reluctant to learn it.

“I picked it up a couple of years ago kind
of as a necessity for my old band, and real-
ized clearly I just need to step up and learn
how to do this,”Jentzen said. “But it turned
out to be way more fun than I thought. I
had played guitar for a long time, but there
was something about bass. There is more
boogie in that — it’s more sexy.”

A After recording several successful EPs
with the band, Jentzen left Chalk Outline
Party in 2007 to pursue his solo career.

Chalk Outline Party distinctly marked
the beginning of Jentzen’s singing and
songwriting career.

“I kind of started a version of it in col-
lege, and when I ended up moving to the
Pittsburgh area, one of my friends, Brian
Sproul, was here and he and I decided to
work on music together and starta band.
We did that for several years, put out some
EPs, did some regional touring, and a cou-
ple years ago, I decided I wanted to do
some other kinds of music,” he said. ’

Chalk Outline Party served as the outlet
that helped Jentzen mature as an artist
and eventually fueled his aspirations to
establish himself as a solo artist.

“With a band, it’s hard to evolve. For
me as a solo artist, I can change something
on a dime if I want to try a different song,
and it seems to be more forgiving of. that.
You can put out an album that has a bunch
of different songs on it, and I don’t think
that’s weird. But if it’s a band, it’s kind of
strange,” Jentzen said. ’

jentzen said he believes more creative
and artistic limitations for members in a
band exist than ones for a solo artist do.

“I was just recording some demos this
weekend where I was asked to do music
with a ’6os sound to it for a video game
soundtrack, and I don’t know what I’ll ever
do with it, but that’s not really something
you can do with a rock band — you can’t be
that ﬂexible. It’s kind of like the difference
between being in a relationship and being
single,” Jentzen said. _»

]entzen’s ﬁrst EP as a solo artist, Great
Inventors, debuted at No. 9 on the national
underground/specialty radio charts. He
said he plans to release a self-titled full-
length album and go on tour in April.

Aaron Jentzen will play a show with
Bear Hands and Ready Room at 9 p.m.
Wednesday, Feb. 17, at Brillobox in Bloom-
ﬁeld.

Junior’s play peaks against Louisville

“Junior Brittaney Thomas shined asshe sped the Panthers to their win over Louisville.

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Sports Writer

On a day when the Petersen Events
Center turned pink, Brittaney
Thomas was red hot.

The junior ﬁnished with a ca-
reer- and game-high 22 points as
the Pitt women’s basketball team
defeated Louisville 72-69 on Sun-

“baseball teams.

the Pete” breast cancer research
fundraiser.

Most importantly, however, was
Thomas’ ability to step up when the
team needed her the most.

For the Panthers (13-11, 2-9
Big East), a team that struggled
with closing out games through-
out the Big East season, Thomas’
emergence proved essential as the
Panthers grabbed their ﬁrst home

4 conference victory this season.

“She really showed no fear, and
she showed a lot of character on
the offensive end,” Pitt head coach
Agnus Berenato said of Thomas.
“She attacked. She was what we
call ‘in the ﬂow of the game,’ and
I think she wanted the ball. She

wanted to take the shots.”

No player was more vital for the
Panthers than Thomas, particu-
larly in the second half. Every time
the Cardinals grabbed momentum,
Thomas pushed Pitt forward with
a crucial shot.

When Louisville pulled within
one point with just over eight min-
utes remaining in the game, Thom-
as scored on a layup, was fouled
and hit the ensuing free throw to
boost the score to 58-54 in favor
of the Panthers. ‘

Later, Thomas hit a jump shot
to give the Panthers a four-point
advantage with 1:22 remaining in
the game.

For what seems like the ﬁrst
time in conference play, the Pan-
thers had a player who looked
conﬁdent taking big shots down
the stretch.

“I’ve been talking to Coach and
thinking about a game like this,”
Thomas said. “I felt like when I
got hot, I was really in the ﬂow
of the game. My teammates and
coaches kept telling me to shoot. I
just turned it on from there.”

’ Berenato said it was good to

have a role player leading them
to the victory, since so often this
season opposing teams’ role play-
ers and not the stars have been the
players to beat the Panthers.

“It was really good for us that
someone else stepped up and said
‘I want to help the team,’.” Berenato
said. “That’s what wins games. To-
night, Brittaney was that player.”

Thomas wasn’t the only player
that stepped up for the Panthers,
as three players reached double
ﬁgures. Jania Sims and Taneisha
Harrison scored 16 and 11 points,

respectively, something Berenato V

also recognized. ’ ‘

‘‘It’s important to have others V 

scoring because we don’t have that
one player that can do it on her
own,” Berenato said. “We don’t
have Shavonte Zellous to put up a
ton of points. Therefore, we have
to balance out the scoring and the
assists.”

Harrison hit _a crucial three-
pointer after Louisville grabbed

— a 42-41 lead early in the second

half. Chelsea Cole contributed by

Dave Warmstedt ﬁlled the vacant po-
sition on his coaching staff with a fa-
miliarface. On Friday, Wannstedt and
the Panthers announced the decision
to hire Bernard Clarkjr. as Pitt’s line-
backer coach for next season.

Clark, a native of Tampa, Fla.,
played linebacker atthe University of V
Miami from 1985-89, which includes
acouple years fromwhenwannstedt
was a defensive coordinator for the A
Hurricanes (1986-88).

As a Hurricane, Clarkwas a mem-
ber of two national championship
teams. He then spent three years in
the NFL after being a third—round
selection of the Cincinnati Bengals.

Most recently, Clark was the
defensive coordinator at Hampton
University in Virginia.

One thing that brought Clark to ‘

Pitt was a familiarity with Wannst-
edt’s system and style of defense.

“I love the way they do things
here because it’s basically the same
scheme we ran when I played at
the University of Miami un-

said. ’ '

When meeting with re-
porters on Friday night, Clark
stressed that Pitt has created a

of Pitt’s coaching staff, but recently
commitments have come from more

recruiting class does not contain a
single signee from the Sunshine —

he enjoys the negotiating process that
occurs during recruiting.

Chris Neverman I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Redshirt junior Kevan Smith is a key returning player for the baseball
' team after batting .363 last season.

best players in recent years, this
year’s squad is hoping to improve on
last year’s campaign underjordano.
He begins his 13th campaign with the
Panthers when they travel to Wofford
College in South Carolinafor athree-
game series this weekend.

With a younger squad than in pre-
vious seasons,Jordano believes that
his team’s potential is promising.

“Developing; Our pitching staff
will be young at times, but every guy
has the tools to be a productive part
of the staff. We have to strive for con-
sistency,”Jordano said. “Defensively,
we were the best ﬁelding team in the
conference a year ago and for the
most part the entire team is back
with the exception of Chris Sedon.
Offensively, same story’?

Jordano pointed to some key re-
turning players like redshirt junior
catcher Kevan Smith, who batted

' .363 last season and senior inﬁelder

Joe Leonard, who ﬁnished the 2009
campaign with 35 RBIs and a .316
batting average. Jordano also said
that seniorinﬁelder Frank Mercurio
and junior outﬁelderjohn Schultz are
important players coming back for
the Panthers. ‘

Joining these returning players
are 11 athletes ofJordano’s 2010 re-
cruiting class.

It’s “one of the most decorated I‘

and talented incoming classes we
have ever had,”Jordano said.

The strong recruiting class, Jor-
dano said, was aided in part by the
construction of the new Petersen
Sports Complex, which could be
open in time for next year’s base-
ball season. The new Petersen Sports
Complex began construction during
the offseason, with plans for a new
turf baseball ﬁeld. The Panthers cur-
rently play at Trees Field, which is
located behind the Charles L. Cost
Center on upper campus.

“The Petersen Sports Complex
will vault us into the top.-three facili-
ties in the Big East,”Jordano said. “It
has already impacted our recruiting
in a positive way.”

Another way that the new facil-
ity will impact the program is giv-
ing the Panthers an opportunity to
host games and tournaments early
in the season — something they
are currently unable to do because
of weather conditions on the grass
surface at Trees Field. The new com-

plex will also help the program with
attendance, thanks to an increase in
seating to 1,000 seats.

With their series against Wof—
ford set to start on Friday, the Pan-
thers will be on the road much of
the early part of the season. They
will not return home until March 16
with a matchup against Youngstown
State. .

Pitt will travel to South Carolina,
Tennessee and Florida for all of its
early season games before returning
home in mid-March. x.

The Panthers begin conference
play on March 26 with a series
against St.John’s at home. With nine
Big East series during the season,
the Panthers have a challenging ﬁeld
ahead of them with Big East favorites -
Louisville-—whichwon the 2009 Big‘
East regular season title and confer-
ence tournament — South Florida
and St. John’s.

The schedule is “very solid from
top to bottom, and I would not be
surprised if it is a dogﬁght down te-
the ﬁnal weekend,” Jordano said.
“We have our work cut out for us,
but we are very close to be ready to
get it on.”

Jamie Martina I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

One of three players to reach double ﬁgures on Sunday, redshirtjuniorjania Sims
contributed 16 points to the Panthers’ 72-69 victory against Louisville on Sunday.

Since the Georgetown loss on Feb. 10, the
team has focused on ﬁnishing, Berenato said,
and the coaches started making play calls at
the end of games in order to take pressure
off the players.

“Just run the play,” Berenato said. “If you
score, great. If you don’t, it’s OK. Win or
lose, we [the coaches] take the responsi-

bility. I feel like it took a lot of pressure off

everybody.”

Due to crucial rebounds and free throws,
as well as Thomas’ huge shots, Berenato said
the Panthers felt they were going to-win at
the end of the game.

“I think that was the difference maker,”
Berenato said.

There was deﬁnitely a difference between
the Pitt team that closed out Louisville and

the Panthers that continually faltered down
the stretch this season. .

Most recently, the Panthers committed
costly turnovers late in the game against
Georgetown, and on its ﬁnal possession,
Pitt’s play broke down and Sims was forced
to take an off-balance three in an attempt
to tie the game. . .

But against the Cardinals, Thomas made
sure that her team walked away with the
victory, even if Berenato had to give her a
little nudge to get there.

“I don’t think I’ve ever gotten mad at her
for not taking a shot before, because Brit-
taney just shoots,” Berenato said. “Today, I

got mad at her, because we were calling her '

number, and she didn’t take the shot. I told
her that we needed her. She really stepped
up for us today.”
