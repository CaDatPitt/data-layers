Noted Frenchman
- Visits University

D’Estourne||es Speaks on Peace to a
Full Chapel. 7

Baron d’Estourne1ls» de Constant,
who was introduced by Chancellor
McCormick as “the pioneer in the ad-
vocacy of international peace, since he
stood for peace at a time when the
idea was looked upon as ridiculous,
and as one of ourselves, since he re-

, ceived an honorary degree from the

University,” gave an address to the
faculty and students on Wednesday
morning. We were fortunate in being
able to hear him, as itlooked as if the
Chancellor’s effort to get him would
be inwvain. But the Baronwas willing
to interfere with his occupation during
morning hours in ‘order to visit us.
He believes that he must take every
opportunity to speak for his cause.
Using typical French gestures and

"speaking a somewhat broken, but eas

ily understoon English, D’Estourne11s
showed the folly of war_from‘ an eco
nomic and scientiﬁc standpoint. rHis
French accent was no detriment to

C him. Rather, we listened the "more at-
tentively to get his thoughts, and we’

considered the position which the ‘Bar-
on holds in the world. The Baron ob-
tained a hold on the audience and nev-
er lost it. His speech was interspersed
with epigrams and a merry ﬂow of wit.
He characterized war as a useless

‘THE. 1912, OWL if -

The University of Pittsburgh Year
Book Comes Out Soon.

The one big_pub1ication of the school
year, the Owl, will be here next week._
The Owl is the annual production of
the Junior Class of Pitt. This year.’s
Owl bids fair to excel all past efforts
of Junior Classes, and the Class of
1912 are enthusastic over the pros-
pects. -The Owl is‘ due to shom itself
next Monday ’morning, the 22nd, after
Chapel and a great success is hoped
for.

The appearance of the book will be
very artistic. In size, it is nine by
eleven inches and is bound in flexible
brown leather. It would be an orna-
ment in any library. The volume will
contain nearly three hundred pages of
the most interesting reading and pic-
tures. The cuts are innumerable.
There are cuts of the faculty, of the
buildings and of many scenes and stu-
dents around the school. The Junior
pictures, tw ohundred in number, are
arranged in a panel in a. design taken
taken from the bronze doors at the en-
trance» of State Hall. There are sev-
eral cuts to every page. In short, the
cuts form. one of the distinctive feat-
ures of the Owl. _ ‘

The, editorial board this year is
headedrby Joseph Neeson of the Col-
lege. Harry Leonard, elected editor of
the.Oowl, resigned during the year.

Pitt Defeats. .
" Westminister

Varsity Defeats New ,Wi|m.ington Boys
.55-49-—Bryson and Rosenthal Star.

(By, Special Correspondent)

The varsity track team won its ﬁrst
annual meet with the representatives
of Westminster College Saturday, 55
to 49. The meet was held on the splen-
did new ﬁeld of the Buhl Club of_
"Sharon and was attended by a large
crowd of athletic enthusiasts.

The feature of the afternoon’s games
was the running of Captain 0. H.
Bryson in the quarter mile, he estab-
lishing a new university record of
50 1-5 seconds for this event. Had he
not slowed down at the tape after he
saw that all his'opponents were hope-
lessly outdistanced, it is probable that
he would have done, better than. 50
ﬂat. The ﬁeld on which the record
was made is said to have been abso-
lutely accurate and the record will
probably stand as a new university
mark. . Manager Chalmers Hall will
investigate further and have the dis-
tance remeasured to insure from de-_

fects -in the record. Ex-captain “Tony”

Ross and W. C. Gill houd the univer-
sity record for thequarter at -51, the
latter being a member of the track
team a number of yearsiago.

‘The Varsity entered into‘ the meet

badly handicapped, owing to--the‘loss— '

“oBsT|NAT,E MARY”

A Success.

Cap.,a—n_d Gown plays to at Large and
Enthusiastic Audience at the Nixon.

Lastyjnight another triumph was add--
edito the laurels of Pitt. The Cap
and Gown Clubgave their fourth an-
nual production to an-enthusiastic au-
dienceat the ‘Nixon. This year's pro-

duction of, “Obstinate Mary” was the"

best, ever and agreat success in every

_ way. The theater was ﬁlled ’wit'h"reI-
_,atives and friends‘ of the Cap and  -

Gown "members and especially stu-
dents. There was no lack of Pitt en-
thusiasm." V

A word about the play itself. “Ob-
stinate Mary” is a three act musical
The
play has an exceedingly humorous

plot running through it with ludicrous '

situations and many catchy songs and
unique dances. '

4 The "plot deals with two maiden
aunts, Sarah Jane and Hannah, whose,
niece Mary Jane,"‘Obstinate Mary”, is

the heroine of the play. Jack Taylor,..

a’ lively young ‘college boy is in love
with Mary, There are no parental ob-
jections_, but the two aunts object.
They are leading members of the W.
C. T. VU., and one of them has seen
Taylor coming out of a hotel of ques-
tionable character. . They believe his
habits_ are not ‘becoming to one sueing
for their niece’s hand. Of course,
Taylor, like other college boys, is in-
nocent. Jack takes Mary for a buggy
ride in spite of the aunts’ objections.
They go to a party at the home of
Mary "Ann, niece of Judge Rogers,
who had been courting Sarah Jane.
Before retiring that evening, the old
maid aunts partake of a little re-
freshments which they thought was
“rosebud shrub,” a light, non-intoxi-
catingbeverage presented them by
the Judge. Soon they discover that
they have taken considerable cham-
pagne.
under the inﬂuence of liquor and pull-
ing off some high-class comedy.

The second act is taken up with a
party at the home of Mary Ann. Here
the song-and-dance (specialties are in-
troduced. In the third act matters
are cleared up for the marriage of
Jack and Mary.

The cast of the play is a sfo'llows:'

..P«t‘.&ss ..Editm.'ia| .Ca.lls :_Atte‘~nti_o.n -To
Pittis .—Fme .w-oa<-

--The -University of Pittsburgh is a
.-thoroughly democratic .institution in
which the people of.Pittsburgh have .a
lJ'11_St pride. The .University of Pitts-
Abnrgh, under the capable leadership, of
Ch_anc.ellor Samuel B. McCormick,
took onqa new lease of life a few years

ago. The great work it is accomplish-
.i—ng».and the splendid buildings erected

and designed have established it as
one of the institutions reﬂecting great

.-cnvedit on Pittsburgh. As the Chancel-
_lor5pointed out last winter, in an ad-

dress before the city councils, the uni-
versity really belongs to thehpeople, of

.Pit1_;s,burg,h_because it isfnot drawing

from the bounty of some rich man. No
philanthropist has endowedit with his
millions.

There ishno good reason why the
University of Pittsburgh should not
hecome one of the great seats, of_ learn-
ing in the United States. There is

.popular. sympathy with the ,effort to

reach that proud distinction. It should
be borne in mind, however, that the
University is‘ of psecial advantage to
those Pittsburghers whose lack of
means bars them undergoing the ex-
pense of sending their sons to colleges
or universities at distant points. The
son of the Pittsburgh family ﬁnds at
the door of his home the institution
that will give him,the educational
equipment he desires.
PITT STUDENTS GO

TO CONFERENCE.

Mr. Gear Makes Strong Address in
Behalf of State Student Summer
Conference. '

Last -Friday, Mr. Gear, the student
secretary of Penn State’s Young Men’s
Christian Association made an inter-
esting address in Chapel. The few
students who were present were all
glad that they had had the privilege of
hearing this leader in college Y. M. C.
A. work. Mr. Gear urged the Pitt stu-
dents -to send a large delegation to the
summer conference which is to be
held in this state in the near future.
These conferences have been largely
attended by college men in past years.
It hasvbecome a tradition at Yale nev-
er to send less than one hundred rep-
resentatives. , Pennsylvania, P e n 11
State, Princeton, Lehigh, Franklin &

to-help in the work of improving the
appearance of the campus. He has
been working along these lines for sev-
eral years and is thoropghly acquaint-
ed with the shrubbery of this region.

conﬁne his remarks to the mere tech-
nical part zofthis subject, but will be
able to pointgout in practical details

used to decorate our hillside.

This is a meeting which every stu-
dent should attend. Our campus, neg-
lected as it hasgbeen so far, is badly

_in need of ‘attention. -The (Science

Club has determined to aid in the work
of making the hillside beautiful. To
ﬁnd some way in which the campus
could be made presentable at a reason-
ablecost is the object of the Club. If
our own native trees can be used .and
the expense of receiving the horticul-
tural varieties saved, then the prob-
lem will be much simpler. Let there

WEEKLY

MAIL BOX

There Was an unsigned communica-
tion left in the editor’s mail box. If
the writer desires the publication of
this letter, he will please see the ed-
itor and, sign the letter.—Ed.

Editor Pitt Wekly:—I have read
with considerable interest the article
in the Pitt VVeekly regarding the
hardships of the co-operative system
and also Mr. Wilcox’s reply to the
same. I am heartily in sympathy with
Mr. Wilcox’s attitude in the matter.

As one of the “Co-ops” I can say
from personal experience and from
conversations with others of the Jun-
ior Class who are working, that our
work is not in any sense a hardship,
and I think that persons who so re-

A gard it have a very much exaggerated

idea regarding the “ease” of the,E'n-
gineering School courses. I will quote
from my own particular case.

My hours are from 8.30 to 5.30 with
an hour off for lunch; the same hours
exactly which prevail in the Engineer-
ing School. And, while I may work
harder during those hours than I did

-in iscvhool, It think that this is more
than balanced by the three to four"
hours per day additional which are of

necessity spent in home study during
the school term. Then there is a cer-
tain triﬂing pecuniary arrangement.
which affects matters somewhat, and
as for educational advantages, 1 think
they may be set one against the other.

I am heartily in sympathy with the
co-operative system, and I do not
think there‘ is any dissatisfaction
whatsoveer being felt by anyone with
it. Yours sincerely,

_L. W. Mclntyre, '12.

PITT VERSUS STATE THURSDAY.

Tennis Team, Picked—Prepare for
State Dual Meet. ,

One of the strongest tennis teams
that has represented Pitt for years
will meet its first opponent on Thurs-
day of this 'week. Penn State will be

, the visiting team and thel’. A. A.

courts will be the scene of the match.

"There will be ample seating capacity

for a large number of spectators and
we earnestly urge that every loyal
Pitt man be on hand to cheer for our

team. Whether you know the game or

not, even if you are not interested in
tennis, you owe it to your college to
do all you can and often your pres-
ence, your cheers and encouragement
do a great deal for the team.
Mackrell, McEllroy, Wilbert and
Sloan composeithis year's team and
State will have to go some to down
these men. The make-up of the State
team is not known to us so far, but we
need not fear that their men will not
be worthy foes. A
lue l‘(:'.SuI1S or the seini-ﬁnalswand
ﬁnals were in some instances close, as
may be seen from the scores:
Mackrell beat Crick, 6-4, 6-4. _
Sloan won from Crick,4-6, 6-1,_ ’9-7.
Wilbert won from Grove, 6-1, 6-0.
McEllroy won from Conrad, 6-0, 6-0.

One match remains to be played yet
between McEllroy and Lewis.

waste of lives, money and time and al-
most Without exception, huge mistakes
that could have been avoided. Leav-
ing out entirely the sentimental side
of the question, the Baron spoke from
the viewpoint of the scientist and the
student of politics. War has dropped
some of its barbarities, he admitted-.
“We do not kill babies now. We raise
them to be useful in the community
and ‘keep them until they are good
enough to be killed as young men.”

He appealed to the students as the
men who are to take an active part in
the peace movement and he advocated
the organization of societies to be
formed especially among students “to
spread the spirit of arbitration, justice
and conciliation.” After the speech the
Baron shook hands with the faculty
and many of the students.

Baron d’estournelles de Constant is
a memberiof the French Senate, a
member of the Hague Court of ‘Arbi-
tration, a former ambassador of
France to England, winner of the No-
ble Prize, and the 5ﬁrst citizen of Eu-
rope in the Peace‘ Movement. During

has been to ‘make it absolutely a Uni-

The Owl costs about four or ﬁve dol-

cause of this action is given as lack

of several men who were ﬁgured on
for the trip. Gordon, the miler and
two miler, who is a student in the

ceived instructions not to use him. He
met the team at Rochester and was
prepared to run but was notiﬁed that

probably won both.hur.dles, missed the
train and this left the squad without a
Miller,’ the
sprinter, had also been declared ineli-
gible to compete and with Robinson
and Weger, middle ‘distance men
among the missing, the chances for se-
curing a victory over the New Wil-
mingtonians seemed anything but
b-right. ,With the ever optimistic Joe
Thompson along to cheer the boys up,
however, things soon assumed a dif-
Joe said “We are going
to win today no matter what happens”
and somehow the athletes became,im-
bued with the idea that they simply
couldn’t lose. That is what won them
the meet. 4

Right at thevvery start there was a
big surprise‘ for Westminster. The 100
yard dash was an event they were ﬁg-
uring on sure with their crack sprint-
er, “Bob” Russell entered. Rosenthal
got the jump on him however, and
breasted the tape a good yard ahead,
winning ﬁrst place. “Ham” Wooten
wasn’t far behind and took a third,

. Russell getting three points for West-

minster with second place. The time
was 10 2-5. -

Surprises then started to heap up.
The mile run was the second event
on the urogram and this was one in
Coach Thompson had conceded eight
points to Westminster. The Varsity
hadno experienced miler and had two

_men entered who had never run the

race before—-Lichtenfels and Bane.
“Lick” proved a dark horse, and a
very dark one at that, however, and
sprinted away for ﬁrst place, Mathews
of Westminster getting a poor second.
Lichtenfels was tickled over the feat
and he had a right to be as he won
his track letter by getting ﬁrst.

In the 120 yard hurdles, Pitt failed
to score and Davidson and Alter of
Westminster took, eight points for
ﬁrst and second. Homer Halferty
started the race but failed to place.
It was his ﬁrst try at the high im-
pedimentsand they weretoo much for
him.

Captain Bryson’s race, the quarter
mile, came next and the gallant Var-
sity leader hung up his new record.
Conway of Westminster was second.
Westminster was sure of Winning this
event with its star, Waters, but he
“ran his legs” off trying to maintain
the fast pace set by Bryson.

In the low hurdles, Davidson again
scored a ﬁrst but Homer Halferty, by
a plucky exhibition, took the second
place from Alter of Westminster. The‘
race came at the most critical stage of
the afternoon’s games and the three

points secured by Halferty really

saved the . day.   “Wes 9,. §9X11ibi-

some well deserved words of commen
dation after he crossed the line 'a"good
second. ' -

There was nothing to the half mile
run’ but Bryson and had he wanted to
“Cap” could have secured almost a lap
on‘ his opponents. As it was, he was
content to run Waters of Westminster
“out” as he was instructed tohdo by

Coach Thompson, so that Lichtenfels '

could get the much needed three
points for second. That was the way
things turned out and the scorer re-
corded eight big tallies for the Blue
and Gold and nary a one for West-
minster. ‘ A ' ‘ : I

Rosenthal and Wooten took every-
thing in the 220 yard dash, also. This
was one of the most closely contested
events of thevmeet. Rosenthal, al-
though compelled to run fromthe,ex-
treme outside of the track, covered the
distance in 243-5 seconds. ‘_‘Ham”
Wooten secured second by a ﬁne
sprint "at the tape. " ‘

The ﬁeld events were well contested
Westminster ‘proving strong in the
weights, with their star, Ashton, and
Pitt being best in the jumps. Ashton
threw the discusL116 feet 11 inches and
took ﬁrst, Parrich of Westminster be-
“Polly” Galvin in the
shot put won ﬁrst for Pitt with a‘ toss
of 39 feet 10 inches. Ashton won the
hammer throw with “Polly” second.
Bob Tinsley secured ﬁrst in the high
jump and second in the pole vault.
McKinney. won the latter event,
thereby getting his letter in track.
Westminster got both places in the
broad jump.

The varsity squad was accorded
very courteous treatment at the hands
of the Westminster management and
athletes and the most cordial feeling
prevailed during and after the meet.
Although competition was very close
and the hivalry for points was keen,
Westminster never lost sight of the
fact that it takes true gentlemen to
be good losers. After each event in
which the Pitt ‘(men won, they were
congratulated by their defeated rivals
from New Wilmington. It was no-
ticeable that Captain “Bob” Russell

_set the example for his men in this

when he wished “Ham” Wooten suc-
cess -in‘ the 100 yard dash as they
walked down for the start. This is
the kind of spirit that counts, Pitt
men, and we hope our athletes will
display the same brand in the Inter-
collegiate Saturday.

Right in this connection, it will not
be amiss to hand our Varsity .boys a
bouquet of the same kind of ﬂowers.
Every one conducted himself in a man-
ner entirely becoming a loyal, repre-
sentative of the University and a gen-
tleman. -

the game was the heavy hitting of the

make up for their poor showing made
in the early part of the season. Mc-

THE SCHOOL CALENDAR.

Several times during the year we
have seen two‘ school organizations
holding their meetings at the same
time. Students who wanted to go to
both were unable to do so. There
should be a committee on our college
calendar whose duty it should be to
prevent such conﬂicts To have such
a committee would entail very little
work, and dovery much good. Our
organizations and social functions
constitute the life,of the school. -No
conﬂicts should be permitted which
would weaken any organization.

Then the calendar should he pub-
lished each week in advance. There
is not suﬂicient advertisement given
our society meetings Were there an
ofﬁcial calendar of events for each
week and that calendar published in
advance as it is at Yale, then each
organization would have its meetings
thoroughly well advertised. VVe ven-
ture to suggest that either the Stu-

question. A
