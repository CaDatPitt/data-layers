boy, football player, lawyer, re-
presentative in the state legislature
and Congress, whistle-tooter for

._pro football games, and his present
position on the bench of the Court
of Common Pleas.

Besides Judge Weiss’ speech,
the assembly program calls for the
awarding of $350 in scholarships

Wednesday afternoon.

In his exact, clipped British ac-
cent, the good-looking author of
“How Green Was My Valley”
slashed into some widely-held be-
liefs and drew for his listeners a
startling distinction between human
beings, an outline of the tremen-
dous influence on the world of
five individuals, a resume of his
own life, and a definition of the
job of the modern writer.

Improve Common Lot

Mr. Llewellyn concluded that a
writer should be a “damned nui-
sance” to the forces opposing im-
provement of the common lot. He
should be a man who can detect
the differences between the world
as it could be, and,by setting forth
those differences bring the world
closer to the ideal.

One of the speaker’s most
challenging statements was his
setting forth of a distinction be-
tween a “human being ” and a
“sentient.” The former’s thoughts
are concerned with the world, its
people, and what can be done with
and for them. The sentient, on the
other hand, is interested in himself
and in other people only to the ex-
tent of what can be gotten out of
them. I

Mr. Llewellyn also hit the
Nuremberg trials of the Nazi lea-
ders which he covered as a repor-
ter as a stupid and martyrizing
move. He described Karl Marx also
as a supreme intellectual, whose
arguments and theories have been
mangled by men far beneath his
stature. He has no use for present-
day Communists, however.

Discusses His Life

Otherwise the author discussed
his life and experience. He ex-
plained his trials, his disillu-
sions, and his successes.

When asked afterwards if all
good writers must suffer as he him-
self obviously did, he replied that
he had enjoyed every moment of it.

Richard Llewellyn was brought

there by the

University Lecture

    

BACKSTAGE CHAT - Richard Llewellyn, author of "How Green
Was My Valley,” talks with Art Contis, College junior, in the Foster
Memorial office. The noted author addressed an audience of University
men and women Wednesday afternoon on “Why Writers Write.”

***

Large Foster Audience

Impressed by Llewelyn

Gasping on the ropes was a large Foster Hall audience when
Richard Llewellyn had concluded his talk on "Why Writers Write”

Series, which was begun last
semester under the direction of
J. Edward Ricart, assistant to the
clean of men.

Two other men have come as
speakers on the Lecture Series,
and Mr. Llewellyn’s talk wassthe
final event of this year.

Dr. Putnam F. Jones introduced
the speaker to the assembly.

Campus Party Places

4 Men; IF

Choices

Win Other Positions  

By BOB THOMAS

The All-Campus Party cracked IF Council's slate in four
places in Wednesday's elections.

In spite of this, Council punched the rest of its ticket into
office and, now sits on top in student government for another year. I

Only one non-frat man came through for the “All-Campus mach-

inc” with Dale Hooper easily cap-

turing a senior Congress post. Dick
Shallenberger, also broke the slate
for a junior spot.

IF Ahead

The rest of IF’si slate came in
ahead in the Congress race. Sen-
10; winners are Hooper, Herman
Levy, Clint Lowery, and Andy
Schurman. Shallenberger, Don Caro-
thers, William E. Green, and Will-
iam McKinley caputred junior spots?

All nine proposed amendments
to the SC constitution passed in
"no-contest” fashion.

Andy Schurman raked in 1208
votes to win the top vote-getter
title this year. Nearest was junior
winner Don Carothers with 1064.
Both men were backed by IF and
All-Campus.

IF’s grip was broken twice in the
Men’s Council race. Len Baker,
college sophomore, and Serge F.
Paris, E&M senior, grabbed seats
away from IF candidates.

Voting Light

Voting was extremelylight, falling
nearly 1000 ballots shy of last
year’s 2500 high.

On the whole the rather hastily-
organized All-Campus coalition

    

 P [levy
showed well in the race. Hooper,
the lone independent to win, was
backed by the A-C. Other coalition
winners were frat men.

Besides Baker, who squeezed
into Council by six votes, and
Paris, the rest of the MC posts

went to IF men.
In E&M the seats went to: sen-
iors, Joseph F. Lagnese, Paris;

 

A Schurman

snallenberger

iunior, Charles R. Wendell; sopho-
more, James Walter Brown. Bern-
ard Ivanschultz captured the un-
contested Pharmacy post.

Senior Business Administration
winner was Ralph Douglas while
the sophomore seat went to Jack
Burwinkle. The junior Bus Ad spot
was filled earlier in an internal
council election.

Eight men were chosen to re-
present the College on Council.
Senior winners were Norton L.
Berman, Richard S. Richards, and
Roy Titchworth; juniors, Sam
Shapiro and Ralph Thorne; sopho-
mores, Baker, Ronald D. Ecker, and
Don Milletary.

Two of the amendments endorsed
by men voters will change voting
procedure next year for Student
Congress, Men’s Council, and WSGA.
Previously passed by women voters
in their election, the aniendtttertgs,
call for men and women voting to-
gether next year. 0

SC Elects

. McCauley

Brenda McCauley was internally
elected to serve on next year's Stu-
dent Congress as a senior repre-
sentative at Monday’s Congress
meeting. 

Miss McCauley ran against Cora
Pancereve, this year's recording
secretary. They were the only two
junior women on Congress this year
and were automatically nominated.

Lohmeyer Resigns Pitt Post:
Accepts Advertising Position

An assistant’s office on the dean
of men’s staff will be vacant May 1.

Publications Advisor Paul F.
Lohmeyer leaves his post next
month to take an advertising posi-
tion in private business. His new
job will be assistant advertising
manager of the Pittsburgh Brewing
Company.

He notified Dean Theodore W.
Biddle of his acceptance of this
post in March, asking that his re-
signation become effective May I.

Here Two Years

Mr’. Lohmeyer has held the publi-
cations post--advisor to the News
Panther, Owl, Compass, and Foto
Club--for nearly two years.

Commenting on Mr. ,Lohmeyer’s
impending departure, Dean Biddle
said, “Mr. Lohmeyer has been
making so many valuable contri-
butions to me, my staff, and the
University that I know it will be
hard to find a worthy replace-
ment.”

Mr. Biddle said there was no
announcement to be made at the
present concerning Mr. Lo,hmeyer’s
successor except that the Univer-
sity is “exploring” the situation.

Asks Continued Cooperation
lle called upon the organizations
Mr. Lohmeyer has supervised “to
continue to show the fine coopera-
tion with the University' and this

office that they have throughout

the year.”

A graduate and a three-year
varsity basketball center in 1941,
1942, and 1943 at Pitt,-Lohmeyer
retumed here as an administrator
in 1046. Until he succeeded
William McElwain as publications
boss, the 6-4 journalism graduate
served as a senior training officer
of the Veterans Administration.

Lohmeyer is married and has two
children, a daughter, three, and a
two-month-old son.

 

 

The defeated member in the in-
ternal election, Miss Pancereve,
claims that she was not elected be-
cause "the group thq wanted How-
ward Greenberger for president next
year thought I would vote for Don
Ewart.” (The new Congress presi-
dent is elected internally at the
end of the Congress term.)

The V0136 Was 9-6 against Miss
Pancereve.

Other members of Congress back
up Miss Pancereve’s statement in
claiming the election "dirty poli-
tics.” Greenberger reportedly knew
nothing about the political maneuver.

From Classmates

Pitt's senior Pharmacy ‘students
not‘only know how to fill prescript-
ions for sick people, they know how
to take care of those who can’t be
helped by medicine.

Last February one of the members-
of their 96-man class, Ugo F. Car-
uso, was seriously injured in an
automobile accident while en route
to school.He is still in the hospital
recuperating.

his fami1y.His hospital bill is taken
care of by the driver of the car's

worrying about his family, since
he can no longer work.

Now, according to Pharmacy stu-
dent Bill Blockstein, the Pharmacy.

Losin Good M in

No employer likes to lose an energetic worker who accomp-
lishes things. ‘Small wonder Dean Theodore W. Biddle regrets the
departure May 1 of Paul F. Lohmeyer, one of his assistants and
publications advisor. The News adds its high opinion of Mr. Loh-
meyer to Mr. Biddle’s.

The adjourning advisor made many valuable contributions to
publications in general and to the News in particular during his
two years on the job. These have, we feel, enabled the News to
-produce a better newspaper this year. His primary effort during‘
his firstyear was to bring about the installation ofvari-type equip-
" ment for setting the copy and the use of offset printing.

This provided a further training ground for future journalists
by giving them more of the "job of producing the paper than they
had previously when only the writing was done by students. At
the same ‘time it cut costs to a point where the Panther for the
the first time in many years used black instead of red ink in its
» 1 books and it saved the News, in a period of soaring printing costs,
I i from plunging deep into the hole.

*** ***

Perhaps Mr. Lohmeyer’s best recommendation was that he
seemed to fulfill to everybody’s satisfactionhis job of Advisor.

It would be‘easy for an advisor to hold a censuring hand over
,. anything that could remotely be construed as harmful to the Univer-
sity'. He hasn’t. In fact, it was usually we who took matters to
him, if we had any qualms about a story or its implications or
I or ramifications. Only one story all year was "killed” by us that
we .didn’t agree should be omitted. And that came not on his direcy
tive, but from a higher body that met and ruled on it.

While serving in the job well from our viewpoint, Mr. Lohmeyer
, also handled it well from the University’s angle. Mr. Biddle indi-
'4 I cared this, ,commenting on Mr. Lohmeyer’s departure, when he
said, "Mr. Lohmeyer has been making so many valuable contri-
I butions to me, my staff, and the University that I know it will
be hard to find a worthy replacement.”
} , Mr. Lohmeyer’s two-year stay in the publications office found

all publications on the upgrade, much of this due to his work. It

will now be up to his successor to do comparably good work so
_ this can continue.

Takes Exception

Editor
Pitt News

We would like to correct errors
made in Mr.Raphael Maher’s letter to
editor on the subject of women’s
elections published in the Tuesday,
April 18 News. We found the first
error in the paragraph in which Mr.
Maher was discussing the election
of president and vice president of
sample organizations. . He says»
"Thus, the nominating committee is
sure of putting two girls on the next
executive,committee,and subsequent-
ly on the next year's nominating com-
nittee.”' The president and vice
Dfesideflt are’ not automatically mem-
bers of the nominating committee
for the following year. The vice pres-
ident is not necessarily a member of
the nominating committee. The pres-

ofthe nominating committee. As such,
she is presiding officer and has no
say in the selection made. Her vote
is only cast in case of a tie. The
nominating committee is usually
chosen by the executive committee
attempts to chose women who are
representative of the group. Most
organizations restrict the number of
executive commi tree members who may
serve on the nominative committee.
Mr. Maher was also under a mis-
conception in his discussion or the
election of other officers. "But if
the nominating committee is really
worried about the chances of one of
its proteges, all it has to do is nomi-
nate some unknown to run against
her and thus insure the ‘election’ of
the favorite.” Just because a girl
is “unknown” does not mean that
she is unqualified as a nominee for
an executivemffice. Popularity rat-
ings have never been a basis for
judgmentin women's elections. Judg-
ment is based on the girl's capabil-
ities as recognized by the nominat-
ing committee, who after all, are a
representative body of the group.
This idea should also cover another
imisconception occurring in the dis-
cussion of Senior Court members. The
statement in last week’s letter read,
l".. .the girl (a transfer student) hav-
ing been at Pitt just one semester
and having just two committee posts
to her credit, thus completely ignor-
ing girls who have worked hard in

fearyof criticism.

In conclusion, we feel it necessary
merely to mention that the President
of Student Congress is nota member
of Senior Court. Perhaps it would be
wise for Mr.Maher to become aware
of the positions of certain Student
Congress officers in respect to other
organizations.

Mr. Maher speaks of fair play; but
is it fair play, Mr. Maher, -to attack
an organization’s policies on the
grounds of half" truths and miscon-
ceptions? 'Facts, not misinterpreta-
tions, speak.

Commends Coverage

Editor
Pitt News

With your editorial in the April
4 News, you brought to a climax
the coverage of Men’s Council’s
attempt to obtain 817 C1 for use as
a men's lounge. From my position
as chairman of the committee to
obtain the room, this coverage
seemed to me quite accurate and
worthy of praise.

However, the problems that we
faced early in the semester still
remain. An adequate, permanent
home for the band has to be found,
so that they may be moved from
817. Rooms need to be found to
accommodate the music apprecia-
tion classes now meeting in the
Panther Room. And, thirdly, a
‘satisfactory program must be wor-
_ked out to meet the needs and in-
terests of the students.

The story is not dead to the
students until next fall. It is my
personal hope that the News will
not let it drop here. And the News
deserves, I believe, compliments
for keeping the story before the
students so accurately up to now. A

N ow In Use

The headquarters of the Student

formed Church is now open follow-
ing ceremonies which were held
Monday afternoon at the church.

' Though nominally only an office
or headquarters for the SCF, the
facilities are available for the use
of all students of the University
for lounging and recreation and,
upon special request, dining.

The wing of the church at Bay-

ard and Dithridge Streets which
has been made available to the
Federation is open under super-

vision from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Mon-
day through Friday. According to
Dick Campbell, any student groups
desiring to use the facilities in
the evening should contact either
Campbell himself or Rev. Nevin C.
Stamm of the Grace Church.

Last Monday’s informal opening
ceremonies were attended by 100
people, according to Campbell's
estimate. University officials,
some members of the Grace Church
board of trustees, the ladies who
will be supervising the facilities,
and a’ small number of students
were present.

Members of the Student Christian
Federation are continuing to re-
furnish their part of the church.

Lawrence Advises Seniors’ . x

Mayor Says “Stay in Pittsburgh ”
By JACK MARKOWITZ‘
"Stay in Pittsburgh” is the advice Mayor David L. Lawrence
gave to graduating seniors at last Monday’s YM and YWCA lunch.
The Mayor, an ex-officio member of the University Board of

According to Pittsburgh's civil leader, this city offers great
opportunities to college students
entering upon careers.
Pittsburgh is in the happy posi-

the future.

Regardless of the excellent posi-
tion of Pittsburgh in the future, the
Mayor soberly pointed out that the‘
most essential requisite today is
world peace.

In spite of the troubled condi-

Lawrence said that he would cer-
tainly like to change places with

In addition several industrial

 ‘Voice’ Singles ‘Out Pitt  
F orF 0 reign Broadcast

By BOB THOMAS .
The ‘State Department’s Voice of America has singled out
Pitt and Pitt students to give a demonstration of education in a

Representatives of the "Voice” were at Pitt yesterday to
-wire record an unrehearsed program to be rebroadcast in German

     
    
   
   
   
    
     
     
  
   
 
  
  
   
     
  
    
     
   
   
   
  
  
     
  

The big, powerful government
"Voice” beams its programs all
over ithe world, 24 hours a day, in
60 different languages.

Pitt was chosen because of its

location in the heart of one of
America’s most highly industrialized
areas. As outlined by Mrs. Agnes L.
Starret, University editor, the pro-
gram planners hope to, show some-
, thing of American democracy as it
works in the college system during
the student's education for a job
in later life.
. In its search for active Pitt stu-
’dents with the double qualification
of a good speaking voice, David
Berger, director of the Pittsburgh
operations of the "Voice,” picked
/ threelmen and two women to speak
on? the program. '

David Rhodes, a graduate law
student, Paul Kraces, a Czecho-
slovakian student who speaks Ger-
man fluently, and Jack Schano,
portrayer of Marc Antony in the re-
cent Pitt.Players production, "Jul-
ius Caesar,” were the men.

Jane Dobrosielski, newly-elected
president of WSGA, and Ruth Hay-
hurst, a German war bride who
married an American GI‘, upheld the
women's part in democratic, co-ed
education. Mrs. Hayhurst serves
‘as a conversationalist in German
besides attending classes‘ at Pitt.
M Three faculty members took part
in the program which consisted for
V, the most part of interviews held in

the Commons Room, the German
Nationality Room, and Mrs. Starret’s
thirty-third floor office.

Since the program is to be broad-
cast in German, an interpreter, J.
Albert, converted the program to that
language on the spot.

Dr. Coit Hoechst, from the Pitts-
burgh Board ofEducation, and Henry
Roebel, vice president ofthe Ger-
man Room committee were .also
included.

°Blennd’ Extends
Open Invitation

All Pitt students ar_e invited to
come and “blennd” at the Student
Congress sponsored April Showers
Blennd to be held Thursday, April

An open invitationis beingis-sued
for this, the last Blennd of the

intellectually through classes.
Phyllis
Blennd committee, stresses that
this Blennd must be a success if
the get-to-gethers are to be con-
tinued next year.

There will be card playing as
well as conversation. Blennd and
cookies will be served. '

Although Herm Meister, Pitt
football line coach, has termed
the depth of the Pitt line as “fair”
no such problem affects the mana-
gerial staff.

As can be seen from the above,-
three of the hardworking managers,
Zoren Popovich, Jim Ventura, and
Ed James, are deep in their duties.
Back at the football problem,
however, the big line coach is ex-
perimenting in the forward wall in
hope of getting better reserve
strength.

According to Meister, the end and
center positions" are the best for
depth. Whether the veteran line will
need many replacements next year,
or whether Casanova still intends to
experiment with a platoon system are
questions that remain to be answered.

Meister’s opinion, though, re-
lates only to the offensive ability
of the team. There has been little
done with the defensive play of
the team. This phase probably
will be delayed until the fall.

Starters in seven of the fourteen events in Pitt's track meet
tomorrow at the Stadium against the Miami Redskins of Ohio are

As a matter of fact, the little

But for a starter, consider the

fact that Rabbit Walton was an
important hand on Jimmy Russell’s
Donora football crew.

“Once you’ve started getting
knocked around in football you get
to like it,” says The Bunny.

“In fact you’re not happy,” he
adds, “unless you’re getting
knocked around out there.”

Probably a better reason forI1ab-
bit’s choosing football is that once
a fellow has tasted success in a
sport, it's hard to drop it until he’s
proven to himself that he has gone
out of his class. And this is parti-
cularly true of the glamourized
gridiron.

Right now, Rabbit is trying to
prove to Casanova that he is var-
sity stuff. So far, the little guy’s
point has been well taken.

Coach Dave McCormick’s inex-

schedule this weekend as the Pan-
thers open their 1950 golf cam-
paign today against Juniata Col-
lege at Shannopin Country Club.

Following today's meet, the
Panthers journey to West Virginia
where a match is scheduled Satur-
day with the Mountaineers.

all that remains of the 1949 team
that won three matches while
losing six. McCormick, plagued
by wintery conditions that preven-
ted practice, and having to field a
team hastily selected from among
36 candidates, will face a formid-
able opponent in Dr. Edgar S.
Kiracofe’s Juniata Indians.

Dr. Kiracofe has four veterans
returning in Allen Arthur, Ray
Korody, Robert Rhodes and Frank
Stasenko. The Indians hung up a
record of 8 wins and 1 loss last
season, including a 5-4 verdict
over Pitt. V

Expected to see action against

the Indians today are veterans
Mihocko and Anderson, and new-
comers Bob Reilly, Bill Stitt,
Blaine . Helner, Myron Schwartz,

and James Cox. Coach McCormick
is expected to use the same line-
up ‘against West Virginia tomorrow.

 .i1(.I2-Yard Punt
r Highlights Cas’
College Career-

Did you know that in Jock
Sutherland’s first year as head
coach at Pitt, Len Casanova
was ‘a standout halfback for

 ~Santa Clara‘?

’ Ed James, one of the varsity
managers, points out that in
§paldings Official Football Guide

 of 1925, Cas is listed as an
"outstanding halfback."
_ The Guide also says of the
new Pitt coach: ‘‘In the St.
Mary’s game Casanova got off an
extraordinary punt when he
kicked from three yards behind
his own goal line, the ball
-traveling 60 yards in the air and
 bounding to the opponents’ one- '
yard line before it was touched
by a Santa Clara player. Total
yardage on the punt was 1112.”

On the preceding page, the
‘Guide’ casually mentions Dr.
Sutherland. “With a team com-
posed largely of green material,”
Spaldings' Guide says, “and a

,, .,new coach....”

Coming from behind in the last of
the seventh inning, the Faculty Die-
hards staged a desperate three run
rally to edge Desota Hall, 11-10,
Tuesday at the Ellsworth field.

Louis Ilough, the batting star for
the Diehards, drove in the tying and
winning runs with a line drive single
to left field. Successive singles by
Ed Trombor and Jim Gomersal and a
walk to Jerry Price set the stage for
Hough’s game winning hit.

Both teams were shaky at the start
with a total of 16 runs scored in the
first three innings but settled down
after that.

A record total of approximately
315 players took part in Tuesday’s

Debate   Sets

'Amendment

Opinion

Although the Student Congress
constitution has now been amended
to allow men and women to vote
together in the same election, opi-
nion has not yet consolidated on
the idea.

In a debate held prior to men’s
elections, four members of the Pitt

,debate team mirrored student
thought on the proposal.

A negative team of Cyril Wecht
and Roy Nelson vigorously opposed
throwing the two previously-sepa-
rate elections together. Said Nel-
son: "It would extend the dirty
politics of IF Council into wo-
men's elections.

The affirmative team of Bill
Swanson and Fred Purdy con-
centrated on the idea that sepa-
rate elections for student offices
are undemocratic.

By E &M R epresentative

A proposal to send a representative from Men’s Council to
the E&M meetings was turned down at Men’s Council meeting last
Tuesday.

The suggestion was raised by Elido Monoriti, an Engineering
and Mines representative. A spirited discussion followed im-
mediately. _

Men’s council members turned
the proposal down on the basis that
since Council is a higher body than
the E8zM cabinet, the engineers
should send a representative to
Council if they want better repre-
sentation.

The Fair is given each spring by
members of the guilds, sponsored by
WSGA to give freshmen women a pre-
view of the major campus activities.

The group projects, which began
in the fall semester, will be dis-
played in 1217 Cl. Anotherpart of
the Fair will include skits and short , ,
programs presented at 3:30 mm. in ’
1228 Cl.

Prizes will be awarded for the
best display and also for the best
skit.

their sole contact with the student
body was through their personal
acquaintances, in the Tuck Shops,
01; within their fraternities.

As far as Monoriti’s recommen-
dation went, Council suggested
that if E&M Cabinet or any other
group of engineers would allow
him at their meetings, he could
attend.
