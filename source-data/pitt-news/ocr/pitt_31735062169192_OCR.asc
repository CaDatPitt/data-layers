Sparse Senate OKays ‘

Todays College Presidents
Must Adapt to New Roles

by IVAN ABRAMS

The college president of
today, according to a New
York Times Magazine article
last Sunday, must be a sales-
man, philosopher, and riot
preventer.

The men now rising to the
top positions at many schools
are different than their predeces-
sors, stated Andrew Hacker, the
author of the article and a pro-
fessor of government at Cornell

DR. SWESLEY W. POSVAR
Chancellor-Elect

.University. He said that the

campus chief executive of 1967
discovered early in his career
that he was fonder of adminis-
tration and committee work than
teaching. His superiors, the a-rti-
cle continues, were ‘quick to rec- .
ognize this ability and assigned

” ':>*the professor a minor, but prom-

ising, deanship.

It is at this point that Hack-
er sees the future president's
career takes shape. Of course,
he says the familiar ritual of
protesting about the’ courses
left untaught, the research left
incomplete, must be made, but
the administrative professor is
re-ally much happier away from
the classroom or the laboratory.

According to Hacker, the
switch from the lecture hall to
the office is usually made be-.
tween the age of 35 and 45, not
long, he says, before the man
so honored begins to consider

..-7'-“himself to be presidential tim-

3,

her.

Since about half of the pres-
ent group of college presidents
have risen through the ranks of
their own institutions, the young
dean may decide to remain at
his own school and hope for the
best. Yet, Hacker states, he may
just as often accept a position
of responsibility in a different
institution, especially if at his-.
original university there is a
surplus of young, promising
deans and vice-presidents all
hoping to one day become pres-
idents. ‘

Hacker emphasizes that in or-_
del‘ to be able to demonstrate
such mobility- the presidential
hopeful must exhibit certain im-

  

  
 

bring to the school refreshing
new ideas o-n educational philo-
sophy. A book, says Hacker, is
especially valuable here.
Second, the presidental hope-
ful must demonstrate good “stu-
dent relations” or, as Hacker
prefers to term it, “riot control.”
For many presidents this has
been a downfall, particularly in
the larger multiversities where
personal contact with students
is rare, Hacker .em_-phasized.
Yet, H-acker feels that the col-
lege president's most important
quality is his success as a sales-
man, He must be able to sit
down to tea with the spinster
heiress in the afternoon and eat
dinner with the governor the
same evening, both in order to
secure funds for his university.
It is as a salesman, Hacker says,
that the president can put all
of his qualities to use. His Ph.D.
never fails to impress the gen-
eral public and his administra-

tive experience easily charms

the politician.

Also, Hacker states, while the
college president generally has
spent some time -teaching fresh-
men and sophomores, he is real-
ly much more at home in adult
surroundings, and -so able to re-
lax, even when approaching peo-
ple for funds.

With today’s growing depen-
dence on grants and foundations,
universities often select presi
dents familiar with the opera-
tion of these organizations. And,
states Hacker, they just as fre-
quently select professional sol-
diers who are able to work their
way through the Pentagon red
tape and secure funds for mili-
tary research for their school.

During their tenure as presi-
dents, Hacker says, the contem-
porary administrators are fre-
quently so involved with non-
‘academic matters that presi-
dents often let the traditional
academic structure drift along
without change. 0

While Hacker lament-s the
fact that today’s college presi-
dent is beginning to seem as if
he came out of a standardized
mold, he sees this as being typi-
cal of American leadership in
all ﬁelds today. These adminis-
trators, he states, wield consi-
derable power. While they may
not personally be in power, they
are at least -the spokesmen for
an important segment of Amer-
ican culture and often ‘indicate
the future of higher education.

Allocation of $16,000
To 1 3 Student Groups 

by DAN BOOKER

Six Student Government (S-G)
senators approved $16,429 in al-
locations to student organiza-
tions Sunday. All of the 13 rec-
ommendations made by the Al-
locations Committee were ap-
proved in what was the last
group of per term allocations
that will be made. Allocations to
student organizations will now
be made for a fiscal year.

The bulk of spring and sum-
mer term funds approved by the
Senate will be used to increase
programming in these terms.
Eleven thousand dollars went to
the Student Union Board (SUB)
for events ranging from weiner
roasts to a Spring term concert.

College Editors Reject
“The Campus Courier”

The controversy over Campus
Courier, the Reader’s Digest As-
sociation, Inc., new campus sup-
plement, continues ‘among col-
lege editors.   , g

‘ The United States Student

Press Association in Washing A

ton, with 310 college newspa-
pers as members, has advised
the campus press to reject the
proposed Reader’s Digest sup-
plement on the ground -that de-
pendence on an “external or-
ganization” poses a “long-term
threat to the freedom of the col-
lege press.”

However, the Associated Col-
lcgriaxte Press in Minneapolis,
with 750 members, has sent out
a letter saying the Courier, “sur-
rounded by the proper safe-
guards as it is, and molded to
the editorial needs of the college
press, would be good for the dis-

tributing newspapers and for
the ﬁeld.

Skip Leabo, associate director
of the Minneapolis group, said
one of the safeguards was the
promise from the National Edu-
cational Advertising Service Di-
-gest affiliate, that there wouldbe
no decline -in the back-and-White
lineage in the regular papers

due to color ads in the supple-'

ment. NEAS is also a. national
advertising representative for
college papers.

Mr. Leabo explained that the
National Advertising Service,
the NEAS predecessor, ran a
successful supplement, Campus

Digest for about 10 years prior '

to World War II. A second at-
tempt with the same name in
the early 1960’s “never got off
the ground,” it was noted.

Youth Advisory Council

Probes Pennsylvania Exodus

.by LINDA GOLDSTEIN

(Miss Goldstein is serving on the
Governor's Youth Advisory Coun-
cil representing the Young Demo-
cratic Clubs of Pennsylvania, of
which she is College Director.)

‘Pennsylvania gran-ts more bac-
calaureate degrees than any
other state, yet our state is not
deriving a proportionate beneﬁt
from what statistically is in our
favor. For statistics (from the
US. Bureau of Census) also‘ re-
veal that the number of young
people leaving Pennsylvania, in-
cluding a good percentage of
men and --women with higher
education, has posed a serious
problem.

This dilemma is the ﬁrst task _

assigned to Governor Raymond
P. Shafer’s newly-created Youth
Advisory Council (YAC), which
is composed of leaders of state-
wide youth groups who will
thoroughly explore such topics
as out-of-state migration.

The initial meeting of the
YAC was held recently in Har-
risburg. At that -time, John T.

 

‘Acﬁonr YAC. director, .explsained '
.» ..‘_v -- A7‘  I,.'.'.“‘v'~_-  1 

    

group: “The ﬁrst project of the
Council is to try to investigate
the reasons for young people
leaving Pennsylvania and to
make recommendations to be
carried out.” Action felt that
solutions could range from len-
couraging new industry to rais-
ing salaries in government to
more publicity of available job
opportunities. ,

Action made the point that his
research indicated that the peo-
ple who are moving out of Penn-
Sylvania are not particularly un-
skilled. The largest numbers of
out-of-state migration appeared
to be drawn from the higher
educated and from people rear-
ed on farms.

In studying speciﬁc profes-.

sions, the point was made that
teachers, for example, beneﬁt
from a move to an adjacent
state such as New York where
salaries are much higher. This
is signiﬁcant in light of the
fact that 65 per cent of migra-
tory people move, for job-related
fl?-?‘§°??S .:-3 0.9 din ' -S

 

    

'Ilhe ﬁrst step toward ascer-
taining the reason-s for young
people leaving the state is the
preparation of a poll by YA'C to
try to determine what young
people speciﬁcally feel about
such questions as their job op-

portunities in Pennsylvania and

even probing such areas as the
image the state holds to young
‘people in terms of their career

. aspirations.

The concert, scheduled for June
2, alone accounted for $6,500» of
the SUB request. Funds for so-
cial and art ﬁlms, publicity, and

Public Affairs lectures ﬁlled out i

the Board’s request.

Students for Peace also re-
ceived .$2'5O to sponsor two speak-
ers during the third term.,'l"he'
speakers included Staughton
Lynd, controversial professor
who was dismissed from Yale,

and Rev. Bevel, an associate of it

Martin Luther King in the South-.

ern Christian Leadership Con-  

ference.
The biggest row occured when
the Pitt Players’ $1,624 request

came -before the sparse Senate."_ _'_ V
The committee recommended 

that $1,494 be allocated. The
sum was to be used almost en-

tirely for publicity for two plays ‘

to be held the third term. Sen-

ators questioned paying for puv I
..blicity for one play, sponsored

by the University of Pittsburgh
Theater, which is a wnfederar
tion of the University Theater
and the Pitt Players.

The committee explained that _

the allocation would allow v~ the
undergraduates to play an im-

portant role i-n a University pro :::.:
duction which is usually direct-i

ed and run by the Department
of Speech and Theater Arts. The

ultimate goal, said the commit-.

tee, is to to allow the under-
graduates to completely pro-
duce their own play. The rec-
ommendation of the committet
was approved on the condition
that, as President Ken Freder-

ick stated, “We make sure‘ that 

the undergrads put on their own
play.”

W'PGH received $1,925 for
equipment and news and music

services. The equipment  be 

used to expand service to other

areas of the University and to

other schools.

Army Blues, a women's affili-
ate to the Army ROTC, received
$700 for uniforms for 10 mem-
bers. A similar request from
Angel Flight, which is associ-
ated with the Air Force ROTC,

was refused by the committee r
because of a poorly prepa.red_'

budget.
Other organizations receiving
funds included: Men’s Council,

$520; SG, $250; OW], $220; and- ,

the Society for Conservative
Studies, $32. The Army ROTC
Cadet Brigade, the East Asian
Studies Group, and the Pitt Sing-
ers received none of their re-
quested funds.

Spring Tuition Charges   [

Will Be Corrected

The disparities of the third
term billing system will be cor-
rected, according to David Smith,
assistant to the vice-chancellor
for ﬁnance. ‘

Bills for students attending
both seven and a half week
terms whose combined invoices

"produces tuition charges, exclu-
' S   .,

  

,$iY¢; 

    

each school, will be adjusted.

Also corrections will be made
for those out-ofstate students
whose combined invoices charge
an_ out-of-state fee in excess of
$100.

Students with such charges

should present both bills to Stu-

4?” Accounting: .935 ..-9.1?

the Master of Science -in Civil
Engineering and a Master of
Public Works. There will also
be available a three-term pro-
gram leading to the degree of
Master of Public Works.

Six Student Government (SG) senators out of the 25 elected repre-
sentatives met Sunday and approved $16,429 in allocations to various stu-
dent organizations. Although this is the Spring term, we feel that the
students who chose to run for the Senate have an obligation to fulfill their
responsibilities, one of which includes the important task of evaluating and
giving ﬁnal approval to student allocations.

S The intense amount of activity surrounding SG elections each Janu-
ary and the weeks preceding it would lead the casual observer to believe
that students take the privilege of serving in their Student Senate seriously.
The coveted awards bestowed on the victors put this campus in a state of

frenzy during campaign time that is unequalled during the course of our _

school year. We lament that the prize of representing the student body,
which has so much status in January, continually loses its value as the year
progresses. The poor attendance at Sunday’s meeting is only a minor
indication of the pathetic senators that are responsible for serving our
students. Their poor turnout during the past Winter term is more regret-
able, as is their performance as a whole during the SG meetings.

The six senators who did attend Sunday’s meeting approved an allo-
cation which we must question. The sum of $700 was given to Army Blues,
a women’s organization associated with its male counterpart in ROTC.
The group, which was recently granted recognition, received funds to pur-
‘chase ten uniforms, costing $70 apiece. A similar organization, Angel

most likely to, too, will be granted several hundred dollars in the near‘

future for the same purpose.

We can see no justificaton in awarding money for uniforms to what
is basically a social organization, regardless of their affiliation with the
military. As they are performng no service where they must" officially ap-
year in uniform at a University function, such as the University Band or
the Cheerleaders, we must disagree with first the Allocations Committee’s
decision to grant the money and secondly, SG’s approval of this stand.

We are in no way questioning the existence of a group such as the
Army Blues or Angel Flight, but we do not see why money should be
bestowed to outﬁt members of these organizations. We feel that this sum
could be used in ways that would better serve the student body, such as
obtaining a prominent speaker for one of the Public Affairs Series.

In all fairness to the Army Blues, we must point out that one of its
leade-rs informed us that she was told that organizations are only able to
use money earned by their members during fund—raising drives for charit-
able purposes and a grant from the Allocations Committee was her group’s
only alternative, -aside of paying for their own uniforms. However, we still
cannot see the validity of the decisions made- by the Allocations Committee
in this one instance. ~

There are so many avenues open to better this University's extra-
curricular activities, and we cannot waive from our belief that a basic cri-
terion of the Allocations Committee must be, “Does this allocation serve a

S" Brourman -Story

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to start off by
saying I am a Black Afro-Ameri-
can militant, This does not mean
that I go through life wanting
to kill “Whitey”; I don’t believe
in being abused, ostracized, in-
suled, etc. (without provocation)
and take is passively, while I
have my prayerbook in hand. I

I‘ ‘ am a strong advocate of retalia-

tion. Granted, some of my asso
oiates disagree. They feel that

‘we should pray for those who
””“do us in.” I h-ave long since re-

jected their philosophy.
Question: Why shouldn't Blacks
protest the war in Vietnam?
Can you possibly imagine the

if mental anguish a black man

must experience when he comes
home from Vietnam (if he is
still-living) and ﬁnds that the
black problem still

U.S.A. (not Springﬁeld, Ohio, or
Pittsburgh, Pa., lor hometown
anywhere), this same man can-
not (-in still an alarmingly large

- amount of cities, large and small,

north and south’) expect to be
hired on what qualiﬁcations he,

0 . .. as an individual, has to offer.
-He cannot live anywhere, can-

not. go anywhere, most disgust-
wing of all, the man runs the risk

of a .sniper’s bullet in his back

should he attempt to register
and vote (get out of line). There
is segregation everywhere; in
the south “whitey” tells you
where you can go. In the north,
“whitey” has been known to
tell you but he has a style all
his own. He practices deceit’.
Let the record show that not all
non-blacks are bad. It is those
ones that are deﬁnitely bad -
these are the ones that are ask-
ing for a mass uprising. Blood-
shed one cannot imagine. Dr.
King has succeeded in keeping
the lid on things for quite a
while. Now even he must admit

that it is senseless to ﬁght over-

seas when he have a ﬁght on
the homefront. g

A good argument: What about
all those black “boys” that en-
listed? a

When you are going to be re-
ferred- to as a "boy” all your
life your best course of action
is to» go to -the front line and
try to get yourself shot-dead.
What good is life without man-
hood?

'Also, 100,000 black men did
not enlist. (Brourman never said
they did but he implied that all
those black men ﬁghtinginViet-
nam were in full agreement

rage did not have a burning de-
sire to‘set things right overseas,

Operator Rebuts
Blumberg Letter A

Editor, The Pitt News:

In response to Audrey Blum-
berg’s criticism of the telephone
operators, I feel that it was un-
fair. First of all, as a.student
operator for the past year, _I
have encountered many rude
students who haven't yet learn-
ed any manners. Secondly, the
telephone operators do not make
the rules that govern calls after
11 p.m. Their concern is doing
their job, and sometimes the
students interfere rudely. M-iss
Blumberg should direct her com-
plaint of this “no calls after 11
pm.” to the appropriate party.
Thirdly, students do not realize
the enormous job of running a
switchboard like the one at the
University.

Letters to the editor must include
the complete name and school or
address of the waiter. Where pos-
sible, letters should be typewritten
and triple-spaced. Names will be
withheld at the request of the
writer. The Pitt News will pub-
lish, space perrnitting, all literate
letters which do not contain libe-
lous material. All letters-are sub-

ject to condensation by the editor,

Address letters to ‘Letters to Edi-
tor,‘ The Pitt News, 407 Schenley
Hall.-

Anyone who has seen the size
of the University switchboard
marvels at the speed and accura-
cy -that the operators answer
calls. Finally, the present size
of the switchboard is not ade-
quate for -the number of calls
that come in each day, and me-
chanical difficulties occur like
two people on one line, lines
that don’t answer, and discon-
nections. Certainly the opera-
tors are not responsible for this.
I feel Miss Blumiberg owes the
University operators an apolo-
gy. She will be welcomed to
a tour of the switchboard, and
it will allow her to see the enor-
mity of the switchboard opera-

.tors’ job. I feel that the opera-

tors are doing a terriﬁc job
with the present cond-itions.

Students Decry

0 Summer Billing

Editor, The Pitt News:

As four out-of-state students at-
tending both the Spring and Sum-
mer sessions, 1967, weare deeply
concerned about the newly inti-
ated billing procedure. If Dean
Rush has “no idea of exactly
how many students are affected,
but has only heard of a few
cases and really thinks that it's
not a problem,” then we suggest
that she open her eyes and real-
ize the ﬁnancial demands that are
being imposed upon those at-
tending both the Spring and
Summer sessions. In Tower C
alone, 150 women are being

housed for the full spring term.

Although the out-of-state fee
is to be abolished in Fall, 1967,
we ﬁnd it incredible that we
are being required to pay 'a
higher rate (i.e. $25/3 credits)
which, in most cases, exceeds
the previous ﬂat rate of $100
per term. What is the necessity
for increasing the oust-of-staite
fee, when plans for abolition are
imminent? Why should students
attending both sessions be pen-
alized?

Furthermore, there seems to
be no logical rational justifying
a per credit charge for those
students carrying 15 credits or
more over the 15 week period.
For example, an oult-of-state stu-
dent a.ttending either the Fall or
Winter trimester carrying 18
credits is charged a ﬂat rate of
$700. Currently, a student at-
tending the University [between
April and August (supposedly a
third trimester) :is charged $846

for the same 18 credits! The Uni- 

versity Fee, in accordance with

the other charges appearing on-

the invoice, is raised.

We strongly urge the Office
of Financial Affairs to investi-
gate and take action on this
matter immediately.

Robert Byman
University of Illinois

 

Robert W. Galvin
Chairman, Motorola Inc. .

POINTS OF VIEW are exchanged about business in this 15th of a series of dialogues between

Robert W. Galvin, Chairman of Motorola Inc. and Robert Byman, student at University of Illinois.
This continuing discussion, taking place since last October, reviews issues raised by students . . .
and a businessman’s answers to the points they present. Similar dialogues are taking place
with five other students-—the letters being published on a total of 29 campuses.

    BEWARE
the Plastic Carrot  

Dear Mr..Galvin:

Johnny Hart, in his comic strip B.C.', poses
two ants on an anthill. The first queries,
”What do you feel is man's greatest
triumph?” The second answers
unhesitantly, ”The achievement of social
affluence,” ”.,. ._And his greatest failure?”
Without pause, the second ant replies,
”The development of money as incentive.”

I, as a veritable ant in the scheme of
things, marvel at the social affluence that
business has wrought for mankind. But I
‘can't help but think that the development

of money incentive is something of a failure.

One of your letters made mention of the
fact that someone is promoted every ten
minutes at DuPont. But how do you
define promotion? By a raise? Is a
$10,000—a-year man higher in rank than
a $9,000-a-year man? How much higher?
There are 100,000 DuPont employees,
but there surely aren't 100,000 ranks;
there are 100,000 different salaries.

Which comes first, the chicken or the
egg, the salary or the importance?
Obviously, a good businessman will earn
more than a less valuable individual
within the corporation, but I suspect that
the profit motive is stronger for most
than any desire for achievement. Doctors
and lawyers gauge their success by the
number of cases they cure or win. If they
are successful, the money will come-
after achievement. Businessmen are given
their salary—and then they are expected
to achieve..When TIME writes about

F. Lee Bailey and his peers, the article talks
cases. When TIME lists the top ten men
in business, it lists them by salary.

You alluded to this point in a letter; you
said a raise in salary does not guarantee
success. But it appears to me that business
has put the salary before the importance.
If so, I see it as a failure.

—-Robert Byman
University of Illinois

Dear Mr. Byman:

An associate of mine once taught American Literature to
11th grade boys. Your letter calls to mind a conversation
in which he expressed a central struggle he had through-
out the course: He believed the students should be there
tolearn; too many of the students thought they were
there to get grades. ‘

This former teacher remembers as his own greatest
successes those boyswho came to understand that, if they
learned, the grades would follow——and that, on the other
hand, getting good grades does not necessarily prove

that one got the content of the course.

Why did these boys want good grades? To get into a good
college. Why did they want a good college? To get a good
job. What was a good job? One that paid well.

I suggest that the carrots in front of these particular
young men were plastic carrots._ Inedible, or at best,
only ‘semi—nutritious. '

The healthiest approach for any doctor or lawyer,
educator or businessman is to do his job well and let the
money follow. I do not know any doctor or lawyer,
educator or businessman who would say that money has
never been an incentive—but should doctors or lawyers ‘
or businessmen have money as their only goal—I think
this is tragic. ' '

You are right to rank your workabove the money it
brings. I hope you have no convictions that every
”businessman” does the opposite.

A $10,000-a—year man is probably ranked as more valuable
than a $9,000—a-year man in the same company—if-
individuals in a company are given ranks. But take another
look at TIME magazine. It does not just talk about salary
when it talks about businessmen. It reports on what each
man has accomplished, what he has contributed to his
company, and what his company is contributing to our
way of living. The article usually details how the man

has directed his personal talents and abilities toward
significant achievements. One of the rewards the
magazine reports on is the man's salary. But just as
personal satisfaction and fulfillment are rewards that
follow the effective use of one’s talents, so is it that
financial growth is a rewardfor a job well done.

Dave --Welty Fires No Hitter
But Winning Streak Broken

by IVIIKE BROURMAN
Dave Welty and D-on Stock had been idled by rainouts
for almost two weeks before they got to pitch last Saturday
in a.double-header against Syracuse. The results were start-

lingly -different.
-Stock and Welty will take the

. mound on a more regular basis
this Week, and coach Bobby
Lewis is hoping that things will
be--more normal.
Against Syracuse,‘ Welty was
brilliant as he ﬁred a no-hitter
for a 1-0 victory in the ﬁrst
game, The lack of work, how-
ever, was noticeable when Stock
-took the mound for the ﬁrst
time in 14 days.
He was rattled for four runs
in the ﬁrst two innings as the
Drangemen handed the Pan-
thers (7-1) their ﬁrst defeat of
the season, 4-2, in. the nightcap.

pitches against Clarion this af-

bother him. “I had a lot of rest
. too much,” he re-
marked. it

“I threw a lot today (Mon-
day), just to try and get’ back
in the swing of -things. I should
be ready.”

Clarion will be no pushover.
The Wildcats have lost only
three games all year.

Welty returns to the mound
tomorrow against Westminster
at Leech Farm. The Titans de-
feated‘ the mirt-‘ters last year by
a 21 count, but they will be fac-
ing one of the nation's leading
college pitchers according to the
latest NCAA statistics.

The no-hitter lengthened Dave's
scoreless inning skzien to 34 and
was his fourth consecutive com-
plete game. His 14 strikeouts in
seven innings places him second
in the country in average strike-
outs per game, with 16. .

Despite his long idleness, Wel-

ty insists that he was not stiff S

at all against Syracuse. “I felt
real good .‘ . . great. I wasn’t
still.’ at all. I had my control and
didn’t waste too many pitches.
I felt strong all the way.”

Catcher -Chris Mitchell evi-
dently agreed with Welty’s 
lysis. “Chris came out in the
early innings and told me the
ball was moving real wel'l,”Wel—
ty added. “My curve was break-
ing well and I kept it down.”

Jerry Mahle, Syracuse’s All-
America center ﬁelder and one
of the ﬁve lefthanded ‘batters in
in the lineup agreed that the
curve ball was the big pitch. “He
kept it. down and move it in and
out. It was impossible to get a
good piece of it.”

First baseman takes throw.

For most of the Syracuse bat-
ters, it was impossible to get
any part of it. Along with the 14
strikeouts, they had three
groundouts and inﬁeld popups.
No one got the ball to the out-
ﬁeld.

The only suspenseful moments
came -in the ﬁnal inning. Welty
fanned the ﬁrst batter and got
-the second -on a one hopper back
to the -box. He ﬁred two strikes
past pinch batter J-im Kennedy
and then Kennedy took an ex-
tremely close pitch that the um-
pire called ball one.

“I thought I had him on that
cne,” Welty disclosed.

9n the next pitch Kennedy hit

- a chopper to the right of the

mound. Welty deﬂected the ball
to shortstop Ken Cooke who
couldn’t come up with it. The
official scorekeeper ruled an er-
ror, but the Syracuse bench ar-
gued that it was a hit. Welty
then ﬁred three strikes by the
next batter for the no-hitter.

“I think I should have come
up with the .ball,”. Welty said,
“But I'm glad they called it an
error. I’ve lost too -many no-
hitters on those kind of plays.”
Cooke, who drove in the win-
ning run, also believes that it
was the right  “I should
have had it,” was his only com-
ment.

singles man John Keil, who pre-

' vtioulsly had won 16 -straight

matches. The three sets lasted
two hours, 45 minutes, with
Nichols on top 3-6, 8-6, and 7-5.
Nichols managed only a 5-6
record last season in the first
singles -spot, but currently has
compiled an 8-1 slate. Coach Ben
Pope attributes much of Nichols’
improvement to his playing

squash during the winter. Ac-
cording to Pope, “Nichols’ back-_
hand seems stronger and he is

hitting his ground strokes clean-_

ly and with power.”

The play of sixth singles play-
er Elliot Saliner improved over
theyweekend, as he won his
matches by comfortable mar-
gins. Pope feels that “Sainer is
ﬁnally coming on strong and
has gained the conﬁdence to
clean his opponents off the
court.” His two victories squared
his season’-s record at 4-4.

Bob Salembiier suffered the
only loss in the team’s two
games, losing to Yloungstov/n’~s
Ed Tolbert, 7-5, 6-4. Bill Gold-
stein (6-3), Tom Stromp ("7-1),
and Erik Lieberman (6-1) all
scored double victories.

The doubles pairs of Nichols-

G 0 I d s te i n , Stromp-Salembier,
and Lieberman-Sainer also up-
ped their season's record with
two wins each.

The netters new sport a 6-3
record, but the toughest part of
the schedule lies ahead of them.

6 Today, they host Bethany at the

Trees Courts at 1 p.m. Wednes-
day; they face Carnegie Tech

here at 3 p.m.; then go away‘

away against Grove City in a
make-up match Thursday. The
season ends May 27 against a
powerful Penn Stat? team.
Coach Pope expects a tough

-time against the -strong Bethany '

team andc the rinter-city rivalry
match with Tech -always pro-
duces surprises.

“On paper -it looks like ‘a 7-6
season,” says Pope, “but if the
boys continue playing the same
brand of gutsy and determined
tennis, the ﬁnal season outcome
could be different.”
