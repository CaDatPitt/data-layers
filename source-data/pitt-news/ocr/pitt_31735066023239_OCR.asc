Student GovernmeniAwaiis Action From Food Service

By CINDY COHEN
, Pitt News Staff Writer

The “continuing saga of the
university cafeterias” was dis-
cussed once again at last night's
Student Government Board meet-

ing. ‘ ’ '
After meeting with the Resident

1 Student Association Food Service

Committee, members of the
administration, Key Management
personnel, SGB members Todd
Park and Kim ‘Watterson still

. believed that there has been only
"superficial response on the part of

Key Management.

“We feel that instead of dealing
with individual _complaints it would
be better to make people aware of

the basic, underlying problems,”
Watterson said. “Let's worry
about "preventing the problems.”
Watterson said the response
from Key Management to \many
speciﬁc complaints from residents
concerning ﬁnding fragments in
the meat and broken glasses were
“one chance in a million” but after
viewing. reports Watterson said
“there have already been seven or
eight chances in a million and we

have only been back to school for

two months. ’ ’

Watterson cited one instance

- where a freshman bit into a piece of

metal that went into his‘ gums.
“There seems to be widespread
dissatisfaction. _It’s not just the

freshman who are complaining
about the food. We are concerned
about the juniors and" seniors who

‘say that there—has been a decrease

in food quality,” Watterson said.

Watterson and Park said the
cafeteria workers were very defen-
sive.

“Theyare taking these com-
plaints personally,” Watterson
said. “I got the impression that
they are afraid for. themselves.”

Board” member Rita Cordisco
also talked to H cafeteria ’ workers.
“They are very excited,” Cordisco
said. “They are attempting to

V unionizebut they are really afraid.

But they do want Key management

-out of there. ’ ’

The old Webster Hall Hotel will no longer house Plttresldent students but will instead only house those
residents willing to pay the rent in the new luxury apartments that should be completed early in December. _

“If there is no improvement by
next Thursday’s Food Service
Meeting we will have to go up to
the next higher authority. Right
noweall they seem to be doing is
revising menus. A Most of the
problems, such as not enough
dishes, should be prevented,” Park
said.

El_ections Committee Chairman,
Mark Suekoff also gave his
preliminary report. The deadline

According to
Suekoff there have been 3 petitions

" There was some concern over the
fact that people who spend their
days on upper campus, ’ e.g.

The United Way is working
on Pitt's campus thanks to
Kappa Alpha Psi and “loaned
executives-” from various Pitts-
burgh companies.

Kappa Alpha Psi, a social-,
service fraternity, has been
conducting a full-scale drive for
the United Way on campus that
will continue through Nov. 8.

This service drive includes
booths in the Towers and
Student Union lobbies to collect
donations and to tell contribu-
tors about the United. Way. ’

The United Way has 97
agencies that work with 173
services such as the B0_v Scouts
and. Big Brother and Sister of
‘Allegheny County.

The current drive in Wash-
ington, Greene and Allegheny
counties is for $25 million.

Joseph Markosek, a “loaned

executive,” pointed out that 92

"cents out of every dollar

actually gets to a United Way.
agency. The other eight cents-
goes for overhead costs of staff
and pamphlets, he added.

Markosek, an employee‘ of
Westinghouse, explained the
“loaned executive” concept.

“Companies in the area loan

- an executive to the United Way

for 10.» weeks to help with
funding drives.” ‘

Markosek added that the
“loaned executive” help plan
funding drives such as Kappa
Alpha Psi’s.

Kappa Alpha ‘Psi president
Alvin Davis said his fraternity
was looking for something to do
that would have the most
widespread service.‘

' . “United Way touched many
of _-the aspects we were looking
for,”-‘Davis said.

In addition to" the donation’

"booths, Kappa Alpha Psi" is

sponsoring a track meet from
6:30 to 9 p.m. "

“We are hoping to get
groups with 10 members to
come up and participate," said
Davis. He added that the $15
entry fee for each group would
. go the United Way. Registra-
tion forms may be picked up at
the Student Union Main Desk
or at the Kappa house, 231
McKee Place, before Oct.-22.
Q .

‘Davis added thatthere will
be trophies and music to run
by.

Kappa Alpha Psi provides
other services, according to
Davis. The fraternity is
planning a voter registration
drive and a’ membership drive
for the NAACP. A Halloween
party at the Home for Crippled
Children and Thanksgiving
baskets for 10 needy families
are also planned for"the~_near
future. '

. HouseMembers Disagree   

I Over Nuclear Safety

RV The Associated Press
_ WASHINGTON—Members of a
House panel investigating the

;March 28 nuclear accident at Three

Mile Island. disagreed sharply

‘__’Tuesday over what remedial
_ .legislation—if any—is needed to
I. make nuclear power safer.

" “I don't see much chance of
getting a bill out this year,”
conceded Rep. Morris K. Udall,
D-Ariz., chairman of the energy
and environment subcommittee.
Subcommittee members were
split on the question of what to do
next as they sat down’, after seven
months of hearings, to begin

' drafting legislation.

Advocates for a full phase-out of
nuclear power--urged upon the
committee by consumer advocate
Ralph Nader—-conceded they
didn't have the needed votes to
bring it to the House floor. Rep.
James Weaver, D-Ore., suggested

,_ a five-year moratorium as an '

alternative. His idea generated

F little enthusiasm.

Republicans on the panel, who
generally favor continued nuclear

A power, sought to delay considera-

tion of possible legislation until

- next year.

And one senior Democratic
member, Rep. Jonathon B. Bing-
ham of New York, declared: “On
this issue I come out mildly for the
leave-it-alone, or ‘do-nothing,’
option.” a

“Doing nothing is one of the
options,” Udall agreed. He said
such a gesture would be well
received by the nuclear industry,
throwing a “security blanket over
it."

Udall and a majority of commit-

tee members clearly indicated they

' .  .:an A

2. »..,» 

wanted to do,/something as a result
of the accident at the central
Pennsylvania nuclear generating
station. But there was no clear
consensus on what.

A 63-page staff memorandum-

presented , a wide range of
options—-ranging from a nuclear
moratorium to a proposal that all
future nuclear plants be located
away from populated areas. ‘

On the issue of a moratorium,

_the staff report noted that a

moratorium of any length would
lead to a major disruption of the
nation’s already-troubled nuclear
industry.

“To the extent that the industry
is in fact instituting the necessary
reforms, a moratorium, by dis-
couraging and stimulating an
exodus of talented engineers, could
work against the objective of
improved reactor safety,” the staff
memo said.

.Subcommittee members did a-
gree to delay a firm conclusion until
after the presidential commission
studying the» accident issues its
ﬁnal report——expected within the
next few weeks.

Udall told the panel the
presidential commission is likely to
recommend a major restructuring
of the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission.

Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.,
said he plans to get a jump on the
White House panel by introducing
this week a bill that would take
safety and investigatory functions
away from the NRC and vest them

 in a new independent “Nuclear

Safety Board.” ,
It would perform in roughly the

‘ same way the National Transporta-

tion Safety Board oversees airline
safety, he said.

policy would give the copyright committee the right
to decide when a faculty member’s book was
produced with inordinate use of university facilities
and thus give Pitt the chance to claim part of the
proceeds from publication. But, the policy fails to
make clear the criteria on which such a decision
would be based and gives the committee too much

' - BALTIMORE——Dave Parker 1

and Willie ‘Stargell, the power

-‘part of ,_Pittsburgh*.s line-up,

drove in a pair of seventh-
inning runs to ignite the Pirates
attack as they, tied the 1979
World Series at "three games
apiece by defeating Baltimore 4-

"0 in Tuesday night’s sixth game.

It .was" the second straight
victory for the Pirates and
forced the Series to a’ decisive
seventh game Wednesday night.

Scott McGregor; the winner in 

Game Three, will pitch for the
Baltimore 1 Orioles--possibly

against Jim Bibby, who started
- Game Four

but was not
involved in the decision for
Pittsburgh.

- Left-hander John Candelaria
and bullpen ace Kent Tekulve

3; creditable game,

combined for "the seven-hit
shutout—-the first of the

'Series—as Pittsburgh kept its

chances ‘going to become the
fourth team to recover from a 3-
1 deficit and win a best-of-seven
Series. '
Since scoring six runs in the
eight inning of Game Four, the
Orioles have fallen into a
dreadful slump, managing just
one run in 19 innings. Their

' slumbering bats proved fatal to

starter Jim Palmer, who pitched
matching
Candelaria’s shutout through
the first six innings.

Candelaria, who has been
troubled by back and rib cage
injuries, was lifted for pinch-
hitter Lee Lacy leading off the
seventh as the Pirates

sought to get something going
against Palmer.-But Lacy struck

out as a capacity Memorial‘
Stadium crowd of 53,739 roared .

its approval. Soon, however,
the Pirates silenced the crowd.

Speedy Omar Moreno,
criticized for his poor hitting in
earlier games, drilled the second
of his three singles to right field.
Then, on a hit-and-run play,
Tim Foli bounced a ball up the
middle. ‘Orioles shortstop Kiko
Garcia tried to field the ball and
keep his foot on the-base for the
force play on Moreno. But he
succeeded in neither, and the
ball squirted through for a
single.

That set the Pirates’ table
with big guns Parker and
Stargell coming up. In the first
inning. Palmer had escaped a

‘similar jam against the same
two hitters. This time,

9 however, he didn’t get away.

Parker, who carried a .429
Series batting average. into this
game,. drilled a single past
second baseman Rich Dauer,
scoring Moreno with the game’s
first run and sending Foli
scampering to third. A moment
later, Stargell got the second
run home with a sacrifice fly to
left field. --

Finally in front, Pittsburgh
went to the ace of its bullpen,
the lanky, bespectacled
Tekulve. He had been ripped in
Game Four—the victim of the
bulk of that big Baltimore six-
run rally. This time, it was a
different story as he mowed the
Orioles down easily, allowing
one hit the final three innings.

t7<_>ppingv'tthe Battling lBucs After. Gome Six Win

The Pirates doubled their
lead in the eighth.‘ Ed Ott
opened with a single and dashed
to third on Phil ’"Garner’s
ground rule double that
bounced into the left field
stands. It was the second hit of
the game and 11th of the Series
for Garner, who also set a
World Series record in
Tuesday’s game ~ by

participating in his ninth double

play. ‘—

Bill Robinson, who had come

f“.~

into theqgame in a defensive,‘

shift in the seventh, followed
with another sacrafice ﬂy to
left, and then Moreno, who had
left 11 men on base in the first
two‘ games of the Series,

delivered an RBI ‘single, making

it 4-0.

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Football coaches are generally
very cautious people. They are
quick to praise their opponent,
even quicker to downplay their own
squad, and quickest to refrain fror.
making any predictions .about the
outcomes of their games.
_ Unfortunately for most coaches,
some of their players don’t
subscribe to the same theory of
pessimism. Take Pitt Coach Jackie
Sherrill as a case in point. His
team is currently 4-1, and ranked
14th nationally. He and his squad
will play the University of
Washington this Saturday, which is
5-1, and ranked 12th in the country.
Seems to be a pretty good
matchup, doesn’t it? Listen to
what Panther fullback Randy

McMillan has to say about ‘the

game.

“I think we’ll win by at least two
or three touchdowns,” McMillan
said with a smug grin on his face.
“I think we’ll win the rest of our
games this season. No problem.”

At about the same time, Sherrill
pulled out a white handkerchief

- and began waving it in McMillan’s

face, trying to tell the junior college
transfer to cool it. McMillan
obliged, Sherrill pointing out how
he didn’t want to give the Huskies
any bulletin board material.

Sherrill needn't worry there. It’s
not likely ‘that the Pitt News will
reach Seattle during the next few
days, so everything’s dandy in the
Cold War Department.

But Sherrill and his team have
more important issues to worry
about this week-—namely the 5-1
Huskies, who lost an emotional
game at Arizona State last
Saturday night, 12-7.

“This is a very big, mature,
talentedl football‘ team,” Sherrill"
saidi int summing up Wa‘shin'gton.
""'.l?h‘ey have an excellent fullback in
Toussaint Tyler and one of the best
l'3a'cl~'r-s~in*tl'1e‘ country in ta-ilback Joe‘
S‘t‘eel'e‘.”v

_ “l"0ur‘ players know who they’re’

playing, this week,” Sherrill added, ‘

‘l"an‘d‘> this is one of those games
where some of our players are
going to have to play above their
abilities for us to win.”

“Both squadsvare obviously aware
of the importance of this inter-
sectional game, Pitt’s first visit to

9 this year,” Sherrill said.

the west coast since 1971 when the
Panthers beat UCLA in the season
opener, 29-25.

“It’s important for them, Sherrill
explained, “because it gives them
a chance to play a big Eastern
opponent, and ,‘it’s important for
both teams because the winner will
probably jump into the Top 10.”

’ The Huskies rely _on size, speed
and quickness. Their runners are
big and agile, their lines are big,
and their defensive secondary is
faster than Matt Dillon’s draw.

“Washington is without a doubt
the best team we have faced so far
“We’re
going to have to be very physical up
front and force them to put the ball
in the air. If we can control the line
of scrimmage and force them to do
some things they don’t want to do,
then we’ll_have a chance to win.”

Besides Steele and Tyler, other
key performers for the Huskies are
quarterback Tom Porras, defensive
tackle Doug Martin and center Tom
Turnure. Eight of the Huskies
regulars started for their 1977
squad which beat Michigan in the
Rose Bowl. - '

Pitt News Staff Writer

After recording their second win
of the 1979 season last Wednesday
night after Davis and Elkins, the
Pitt soccer team will look forward to
putting another win under their
belts against their next opponent,
the Fighting Scots of Edinboro.

The Scots come into tonight’s
contest with an 0-6 record. Thisis
not to mislead the Panthers who
have a history this season of losing

jo defeated teams. The Panthers
themselves are only supporting a
2-5-2 record, although they put in a
much improved performance
against a tough Davis and Elkins
team last week.

Last year the Panthers defeated

Edinboro at the Scots home ﬁeldby
a 3-1 score.
Jeff Tissue and Tom Liebenguth
-scored in that victory. Tissue, at
wing, scored early into the ﬁrst half
and was followed by Liebenguth.
Liebenguth surprised‘ everyone
including himself when he shot a
ball from the_45-yard line which
ended up dropping behind the
Edinboro goalie.

Tissue, who is an alumnus of the

Edinboro soccer team, looks for a‘

Panther win, although he believes
that the Panthers cannot take, the
game too lightly.
.‘ /
“We may have won that game
3-1 last year but by no means did
we dominate the entire time,” said
Tissue. ”“‘They really came on
strong in the second half after we
had scored all our goals in- the ﬁrst.
We must.be ready to meet them
tonight.”

“We have to play up to our
capability tonight and do it

SHOWCASE

Violence Ruins Atmosphere At Fat City  

Last Tuesday night Iwent to Fat City in
Swissvale to see Bobby Blue Bland and
Billy Price and -—-the Keystone Rhythm
Band. But Bobby Blue Bland could not
appear because of illness. I stayed, along
with everyone else who was informed at
the door, because Billy Price and KRB ~
would still be playing. '

The show was totally enjoyable. The
club was crowded, the dance ﬂoor

. packed, and everyone, including the

' band. seemed to be having a good time.

Between the second and third sets,
however, a ﬁght broke out. For no
apparent reason one man assaulted
another man with a large wooden stick
and chased that man and another out of
the club. The bouncers assisted in
shoving the two latter men out the door.

0

The people with me and around me
were incredulous. We wanted to know
why the “victims” were out and the
perpetrator in. When I asked to see the
owner about the reason for this injustice, .
I was informed that the apparent
“perpetrator” was the owner and that
such an occurrence happens “all the
time.” One of the employees at the door
informed me that it was his job “to get
the peopleuout before he (the owner) kills
them.” ‘

Such incidents are grossly unfair to the
victims-,——obviously, the other patrons
(who ﬂocked out when the fight occurred
leaving a half-empty club) and the
musicians who are performing. There
was tension in the air for all who stayed,
and the last set was not given the full

com. sroliv

attention and appreciation of the previous
sets.

I, and the people around me decided
not to ever return to Fat City until such
nonsensical violence ends. No matter
who is playing ‘there, no matter how
enjoyable, a display of sickening and-
unfair cruelty shatters the whole mood at
the very least. Patronage of an establish-
ment by musicians and customers only
puisan O.K. on such behavior. I do not
think such a club deserves patronage. If
such a performance has happened in the
past, it should be relayed to whatever
media or persons that may support“Fat
City via advertisement, patronage, or
performance.

Of Pitt’s various media activities,
WPGH, the _campus radiostation, is
probably the least understood or
appreciated. This is unfortunate
because the station offers much to
students. ,

Over 50 students work at WPGH in
various capacities. The most
important, of course, are the station’s
30 disc jockies. Because WPGH is a
free-form radio station which
alternates its music on rotation,
students who become “jocks” are
required to play a wide variety of
music.

This rotation system is based on
colors which are assigned to various
types of music. Blue represents older,
more proven  This would
include artists like Bob Dylan, Traffic,
Deep Pufple and the Rolling Stones.
Red represents -popular artists. Bruce
Springstein and Yes would be
examples. Artists found on the orange
lable are known as core artists. They
are similiar to pop artists (the two are
interchangeable in fact) but have
usually received a larger amount of air
play on other stations and also boast
top-selling singles. Billy Joel, Boston
and Supertramp would be obvious
examples. . -

New releases of all types are marked,

with the color green. Yellow conotates
jazz. music.

and Stanley Clark, account for almost
ten percent of the air time.
Perhaps the most important color

label, at WPGH, however, is black.
This is the “image" label. Music
found on the black label is important
because it enhancm the station’s free-
form image. Examples of artists used
for this are AC/DC, Michael Stanley,
Ron Wood, and any New Wave or
punk band.

When WPGH began in 1963 the
format was Top 40. It remained this

, way until three years ago when the

format was changed to the more
progressive-free-form style.

“We're the most progressive of any
of the stations in town,” said Dan
Shanleiilco, general manager of
WPGH. “The other stations play it

‘ mostly fussion artists like Steely Dan

   
    

  
 
      
   

safe, using a combination AOR(Albuin
Oriented Rock) Top 40 format.
Because of therotation, our jocks are
forced into playing different things. ’ ’

Not to exclude any type of music
that would be of interest to students,
WPGH also features a disco show.
“The Groove Line” is on the air every
Saturday night from 7 to 10 p.m.

Aside from music, WPGH also
features news and sports broadcasts.
About 25 students handle this part of
the operation. There‘ are, however,
some problems with the news end.

“Down here it’s mostly the rip and
read method,” said Shalenko, alluding
to the UPI teletype machine which
WPGH gets most of its news from.
The station also uses live audio fee
from ABC News Radio. ‘

“I’d like to see the news more
campus oriented but most of the

people interested in .that go to The Pitt‘

-News,” Shalenko said with a smile.
The sports at WPGH, for the most
part are like any other station. WPGH
features two sports shows; “Sports
Rap” on Sunday night and “Right On
The Pulse Of Sports,” which usually

features a guest interview, on
Wednesday night. Shalenko said the
station is also planning on

broadcasting two Pitt hockey games
from the Civic Arena later on this year.

WPGH» is limited in its capacity to
reach more people in the area because
it is a carrier current station. Rather

ween Radio llas Much To offer To Students

than broadcasting its signal into the
open airways, WPGH must send out
it’s programming through phone lines
and into transmitters located in various
buildings on campus. From the
transmitters, the signal goes into power
lines located within the building and
can then be picked-up on 64 AM.
Presently, WPGH can be heard in
the Student Union, the Litchfield
Towers, and Lothrop Hall.
Transmitters have been installed in the
Forbes Quadrangle and the new Fobes

' Pavilion but have not been hooked up '

to the phone lines. This should be
completed within the next two or three
weeks.

Although there has been talk to the

contrary, WPGH will probably remain '

carrier current and not become an FM
station. Allocations from the Student
Government Board have increased
over the last three years from 2 to 5
thousand dollars, yet this is barely
enough to cover the high costs ‘involved
with running the station.

‘I think most people would be very
surprised if they knew exactly how
much it ‘costs to run a radio station,”
said Shalenko. A

Two examples of these high costs are
cart machines, used for broadcasting
taped commercials and music which
the station does not have on vinal,
which cost $2,000 a piece and the ‘main
console which needs to be overhauled
and would have to be replaced if the
station went FM, that costs
approximately $8,000.

Shalenko feels that one of the main-

reasons WPGH will not go FM is that

the University is probably holding out
until Pittsburgh gets cable television.
He thinks that the University would

rather have a TV studio than an FM'_

radio station, mainly because it would
have more control over the broadcast

content.

Nevertheless, WPGH continues to
provide the best possible programming
it can within its capabilities. A new
programming concept to appear soon
will be all-night broadcasts.

‘‘I’d like to get to a point where
people turn to us 03 a regular basis,”
said Shalenko.

Encore: And ll: Strong'AndRespected_ Jazz Artists  

By KAREN METZINGER .

The Encore in Shadyside’ and the
Encore II downtown on Liberty Avenue
are two of the last remaining jazz clubs in
Pittsburgh to ‘consistently present both
‘local and national talent. The; Encore,
Inc. is owned by 'Will Shiner, and
manager Bobby Davis books the
performers. Davis, though not a
musician himself, has “an ear and heart
for music,” and thinks of the Encore II as
“the number one jazz club in the state.”

The Encore in Shadyside has been in
existence twenty-plus’ years and has
earned the reputation as the third top jazz
club in the U.S. during the Sixties.
Deservedly so, for over the years the

(Encore has presented such performers

Local favorites
include: Harold Bet_ters—who played a
steady gig at the Encore for years-—.,

lot...” to “This is the _most comfortable
club.I’ve been in in town,” and “I try to
come here each time they (the Encore)
get a new band. I like to catch two or
even three performances.” I

The Encore has been known to be the
oldest and strongest jazz club in
Pittsburgh. .

“It’s one of the few clubs that gear
themselves toward good music, not just
enterprise,” ~ said Randy
Purcell, a local trombonist.

The food is good, the service courteous
and prompt, and the stage, though small,
is in the center of the room where the
performers are easily visible and audible

from every table or bar seat in the house. _

The $4.00 cover charge may seem a bit
high, butone must remember, it pays'the
musicians.

. In »a town with so many talented‘
musicians and such a large, though sadly
almost-underground jazz community, it is
a shame that there are not more clubs like
the Encores.

Kresky explained.

Kresky’s hopes for this current

_ .With a;, word of caution however,

Kresky "stressed that, the Stanley project

Theater

much emphasis on films from the
1930s and early 1940s. This becomes a
drawback in “Film”; only connois-
seurs of vintage Hollywood cinema will
appreciatethe parody used in all of the

first act and much of the second. Only.

about five of the 25 movies parodied in
the play were produced in the last
decade. l

Another problem with “Film” is its
pacing. Watching the performance
gives one the feeling of being on some

kind of '.jerking, stop-and-g_o Kenny-
wood amusement ride. Thereare too
many 30-second scenes which require
15-second set-changes. As a result, the
actors look more like an Indy pit crew
and are often out of breath when the
new scenes begin. While it was easy in
any of the movies that ‘are parodied in
“Film” to‘ splice in a_ quick, scene or
one-liner, on stage, with the actors
moving the sets, this does not work.

much better.

light musical-comedy and an‘ excellent
choice for Homecoming.

“Leave It To Jane" is pure family fare,
complete with mistaken identities.
elaborate scheming and those sweetly

complicated college romances that no one
seems to have anymore.

On the first day of classes, Atwater is
already geared up for the big game on
Thanksgiving Day. But Coach Matty
McGowan (played by Scott Williams) tells
the boys their chances of winning. are
slim: one player is injured and another is
married. V '

Big man on campus, Stub Talmadge,
convincingly played by Kevin Cotter, is
the one who’s going to help the team win.
It is the calculating Stub who brings
“Silent” Murphy (Bill Kennedy) to the
college. Stub “discovered” him—mov-
ing a piano—and convinces President
Witherspoon (Geoffrey Thompson) that
Murphy is not there to play football but to
“study art.” ' l "

-Bessie, a state golf champion, walks with

the appearance of having just pulled up

Jane Witherspoon is the’ President's
daughter and college sweetheart. When
one of the young men asks her, “Just
when will you make up your mind which

_ one of us you’re going to marry, Jane?”

she sorrowfully replies, “I don’t know.

Atwater’s' luck changes when the

but also gets him to change his name as

he’s at Atwater. The plot thickens when
Billie realizes he’s been duped.

One of the highlights of the play is the
role of Flora Wiggins” “a, prominent

waitress,” played by Caryn J. Ronis.'

Flora is constantly after Stubbs for money
he owes her mother, as a lodger in their
boarding house. She has also had “rela-
tionships" with five or six college
students. After she is thrown over by yet a
another boy, she sings, “Cleopatterer,”
/the story of the “woman of the Nile,”
who didn't succumb to the sex roles of her
day. The actress’ juts and gyrations
across the stage, as she, poses as a
hierglyphic come alive, show that Ms.
Ronis truly has a gift for comedy.
Thecharacters of Mrs. Elan Hicks of

t.....And Justice For All’: New Pacino ﬁlm PremiresAt Pitt.

By TOM McGINTY

And Justice For -All
Directed by Norman Jewison

“And Justice For All,” starring Al
Pacino, premiered at Pitt Sunday evening
to the delight of several hundred movie

fans. This is easily one of the ﬁnest new -
, ﬁlms to come along this year. It is the

story of a brash, young Baltimore lawyer
and the complex and compelling lifestyle
which is being thrust _upon him.
Although it. is a very fastpaced plot it
never loses any intensity and is smooth
and tight. Bold stills of a courtroom set
the tone of this ﬁlm at the onset and
amply prepare the audience for one of the

most interesting and thought-provoking

two hoursthey’ve experienced anywhere.

The characters are well-portrayed from
a black, transsexual-male who insists on
wearing a blond -wig, to the dying, senile
grandfather of Pacino. Jack Warden is
excellent in his role as a gunslinging
judge who is bent ongcommitting suicide.
John Forsythe plays"a judge whom Pacino
shows extreme hatred towards but who

he must later represent as his attorney. ‘

All of the characters seem to be well

By THOMAS PALMER

Apocalypse Now
Directed by Francis Coppola

Let us dispel misconceptions and
preconceptions. Let us establish, as
ﬁlm-goers, that ‘the ﬁnal scenes of
Francis Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now”
are no less powerful than therest of the
ﬁlm. Unclutter the head, and within
moments of the ﬁrst strains of The Doors’-
“The End,” the inverted ‘montage of
Martin Sheen, and the blurred napalming

of an obscure beach, “Apocalypse Now” '-

emerges like a developing photograph, as
one of the most_ incredible works of
cinema in our time.

John Milius and Francis Coppola’s
screenplay is based on Joseph Conrad’s
“Heart of Darkness,” but closely follows
Michael Herr’s journalistic ‘ “Dis-
patches.” What they have compiled is a

‘skeleton, a.hybrid of surrealistic comedy
and documented terror for the beautifully
copious horror of Southeast Asia.

‘Martin Sheen plays Captain Willard, a
special assignment army assassin chosen
to snake upriver into Cambodia to
‘terminate’ Colonel Kurtz,'played like a
shadow on the wall by Marlon Brando.

Willard is caught in the limbo between ‘

home and Vietnam; the soldier who ﬁnds
he cannot exist sanely in either environ-
ment after having done time in the
jungles. He ﬂoats mindlessly, with no
purpose other than following the headless
leadership of the army.’

Willard is sent on a mission that
doesn’t ofﬁcially exist. Col. Kurtz, the
perfect officer, a soldier with as -‘much
promise as army hawks could ask,
succumbs to the foreign insanity. He is
the living personification of this plague,
the unnatural sickness that touches all
who come in contact with the Vietnam
conﬂict. He is the psychotic thorn in the
army’s side; his existence is the existence
of the unadmitted madness in fatigues.
But Willard only can imagine Kurtz, for
heimust ﬁnd him first.

Another madness unfolds. Willard
hooks up with Kilgore, played with
subdued, displaced hysteria by Robert
Duvall who will probably, and deserved-
ly, receive an Academy Award nomina-
tion for his performance, despite its
brevity. Kilgore is tainted with that
demented army holiness that lets him
stand Pattonesq_ue amidst shelling and
machine-gunning while others hit the
ground; with that murderous, good-ole-
boy impuls‘ivenesst'hat .has him invading

type-casted and the dialogue is superb
, throughout.

The issues covered often are very
emotionally charged, leaving you either
aching with laughter, crying painfully or

fthinking deeper than you may have

good surfing conditions; with that
orchestrated, artistic destructiveness that
allows him to blast Wagner's “Valkyrie”
as they move in to gun down Vietnamese.

' .Is Coppola inﬂating this American
’ grossness, or just using us as the example
or the generalization of a pin-pointed

madness, more so thanks to Duvall, and
.in doing so, might possibly preserve a bit
conscious existence.
Willard watches and tacitly, skeptically
understands. A '

And, it. is apparent, Coppola does too.

Coppola shows -this in the man's

Willard
travels upriver in a patrol boat with these
-young men, who survive on drugs and
mail-call. More appropriately, they are
barely surviving, until from beyond the
trees, with no warning, bullets and
bamboo darts pelt their deck. Coppola
takes us to yet another crescendo of
facing violent death, and shows their only

retaliation as one of screaming in a-,
violent rage and machine-gunning walls

of trees. A

Their barbarism of ruthlessly
slaughtering passing boats of Vietnamese
women and children is partially justiﬁed
with an instinct for survival riddled with
paranoia. Their brutality is padded with
lighter moments of blasting blindly at
animals. ' simply because their sudden

movements trigger the intense realization -

Kilgore exudes this —

' for that next,

happy, hurting and‘ concerned. The

death of an innocent boy, the arbitrary

interpretations of the rights of the
accused, the love and companionship and

that they can be the next American to die
at the hands of an enemy they never see

. or hear.

Coppola mounts the tension perfectly,
creating for us a bearable trauma, not as
severe as those who have lived through it,
but strong enough for us to know ‘the
mental ‘strain. The soldiers sing and joke
and talk of ambitions, all in preparation
inevitable, unseen,
unforewarned advent of death. Whether
they survive isn’t "the question, for
Coppola shows that ‘through the whole
‘ordeal, something in each one of them
dies. _ . ’

Sheen, as "Willard, is strong in his
consistency. He keeps up with. the pace
of the picture and with Coppola. Being in

practically every scene seemed to drain ~

Sheen, to take away from his perfor-
mance. Yet, it is still hard to envision him
doing anymore with the role of Willard
than he did.

Yet this can only be said in comparison
to Duvall’s performance. Though it is
short, his presence can be ‘felt long
afterwards, and will probably be
remembered more vividly than Sheen or
Brando. A "A , »

Brando, as always, is a totally different
story. He moves murkily into the picture,
with Coppola showing us only his face
and‘ bald head, incessantly silhouetted.
We know he is Kurtz, but Brando is so
low-key, it is“ hard to grasp. Something
about the build-up of the character does
not- come out when Willard and, the
audience ﬁnally catch up with Kurtz.

3, MARGERYIMEYERS y

Livingston Taylor's hit album, “3-Way
Mirror,” was released last year, after a
period of almost ten years in which his
albums were enjoying only minimal
success. An accomplished performer,
Taylor has taken his diverse reperetoire
of songs to clubs and colleges across the
country, where he has become a sort of
underground friend. But until the release
of "‘3-Way Mirror,”_ his music had not
been selling to the larger audiences that
often make superstars.

Taylor's songs encompass a variety of
themes and styles, yet each song displays
the unique lyrical and musical character-

istics which have become his trademark.

Once you hear Livingston Taylor, you can
never forget the melodies or the voice,
which is soft-spoken but never shy. His
lyrics often read like good poetry, and
revolve around stories more often than

' catchy phrases.

\,

 

 

. proper conflict.

.urgency and torture.

_ At this point in his career, Livingston
Taylor feels that he has a better
understanding of music than he did when

«he began to make music, and this

development, along with the desire to
keep an open mind, has been instru-
mental in his latest success.
SHOWCASE: The songs on “3-Way
Mirror” sound much different when you
‘perform them onstage. . '
TAYLOR: They do sound differently, you
know. In many instances, I didn’t

‘visualize the way they turned out. They

just happened to turn out. I think it’s

important not to be close-minded about,

your tune. ’You just go into the studio,
and you sit down with terrific musicians
and terrific arrangers, and let it grow.

SHOWCASE: When you wrote ‘TI Will
Be in Love With You,” did you have any
idea that it would wind up with such rich

I instrumentation?

TAYLOR: Oh yes, I. could hear that,
certainly. But a good song should be able
to stand on it’s own. If it doesn’t stand on
its own, there’s no string line that's going

‘to turn it, that's going to make it good.

(Taylor whistles “I Will Be In Love With
You”) It’s got a pretty melody. It's a
song you could whistle. And it’s also a

,song that can handle a tremendous-
‘ quantity of production.

And it did. A
good song has to have a good melody and
good lyrics, and then you can do what you
want with it. .

SHOWCASE: Have your songs developed
in-a way you had forseen? ‘
TAYLOR: I don’t know, I'm a better
songwriter, now. Ihave lost the heat that
I had when I was young, and I lost that
My life's not so
tortured. But I'm technically far better
than I was. I really understand about key
changes‘ and bridges and verses and
choruses, and the differences between a
‘good melody and a bad melody, and
I 7 I understand songs"
technically far .better than I did, when I
started writing. But that doesn’t
necessarily make me a better songwriter.
But it does make it possible to make more
balanced tunes. '
SHOWCASE: What about lyrics?
TAYLOR: I don’t see my lyrics getting
better. You sort of write about what you
write about. Lyrically. I've also been able
toget more technical, but not necessarily
better. I don't think the storylines I write

.‘ today are any better than the ones I wrote

‘ the simplicity. I ‘i

when I was seventeen or" eighteen. A
good song's got to have a good story line.
And that's something you can't just force
or rush. Either it’s there, or it's not.
SHOWCASE: Why do you play children's
songs?

TAYLOR: I play children's songs because
they give me tremendous pleasure. I love
really love the
statements. There’s a song that Leslie
Gore sang—“It’s My Party and I'll Cry If
I Want To.”—-—that’S a great song. One of
the reasons why it’s soterriftc is that it
just focuses in on one thing- It doesn’t try

targets in real close.
SHOWCASE: Will you read any poetry,
tonight? ,

TAYLOR: No, Iwon’t. I haven't read any
poetry onstage in a long time.‘ I found
that when I was reading poetry onstage, it

It just

was in a time when my _music wasn’t.-

being accepted very well, and I think you

tend to look for things that will be,

accepted. And my music wasn’t being
very well-accepted, so I found myself
gravitating to different things. Now my
music is being accepted, and I'm sure
there will come a time again that it's not
being accepted very well, and then I'm
bound to read more. _
SHOWCASE: How does it feel, now" that
your music is being accepted more than
before? ~ _
TAYLOR: Releasing albums increases
your visibility. There are lot’s of people
in different organizations helping me to
increase my visibility. And I had a nice
hit record, this past year an_d that's a big
help, in terms of your visibility.
SHOWCASE: You've said that you’d like
to disappear, soon.
TAYLOR: I would like to disappear. I'd
love to go back to college and finish
college. But you really can't do it, and
continue to have a career. My career
would not_s.tand‘four years of being gone.
So I’m not going to disappear,_- n_ow.__
This gets‘ into some ‘complicated areas".

The only reason for, visibility is for-

financial reasons. There’s no point in
ever being recognized or seen, unless you
make money. doing it. Otherwise, it’s far
nicer to. not be recognized. .
SHOWCASE: What about the desire to
share what you’ve created?

TAYLOR: But you can’t just share your
music. You've got to share a whole bunch
of other stuff, too. It’s the nature of it,
that people want to know other things.
And if -you don’t let them in on the other
stuff, they won't buy your music. You,
for instance, come and interview me, and

you're asking me questions other than

musical questions, and thatis because it
will be written into a piece that someone

' may or”may not find interesting. People

become curious about your personal life.
I’m not quite clear on just’ what goes on. I
have to get more information on this. But
apparently, something goes on, where

‘people wantto know about certain things. ’

SHOWCASE: Can't you withol‘d that sort
of information? '

TAYLOR: You can, but eventually...for
instance, I can say to you‘, “No, no
interview," and what you'll do is sort of
think to yourself, “That guy...I'm here,
Ifvm busy, I've got a job to do. .If he
doesn't want to do it,_then he can jump in
the lake.'.’ And then there comes a time
when my- records won't be selling,'well,'.

He can go to hell, now.” So, you sort
of...reap what you‘ sow. Ilike to do that. I
like to be visible.

SHOWCASE: Would anyone really take it I

interview?
TAYLOR: You'd be surprised. If you, on
a cold afternoon, came‘ all the way down
here, and you were told no interview,
you’d think to yourself, “Cripers, this
guy owes me_this interview_.” You see
what I'm saying? He owes you that
interview. But it’s interesting, the notion
of making ‘a living out of being
visible———fascinates me. I was trained to
do this. ,That’s what I've learned, ever
since I was very little, how to be visible.

I think a publicationlike Rolling Stone
magazine is a very boring publication,
and I very ' rarely read it. Though
occasionally, there are things I'd love to

there’s a part of me that craves to know

idea of what it could possibly be—but it
is. Not only of her, but many people. My
own relatives not included, by the way.

,It’s amazing that magazines like

Rolling Stone and People are absolutely ..

inaccurate, all the time. Out of thousands
of words, their accuracy would be twenty
words. Absolute fabrications. ,
SHOWCASE: People want to know these
personal things, maybe, so that they can
incorporate them with their own
fantasies. '
TAYLOR: Yes, I guess that's_right. And
yet {here are people I’d like to know
about, like. Paul McCartney or Albert
Einstein, or people I really admire.
Though if there’s any chance of reading

some juicy tidbits about Farrah Fawcett- '

SHOWCASE: If you go back to college, ,

what would you majorin? A
TAYLOR: I'd like to major in

government, and my dad's a doctor, and ‘

I've often thought of being'a doctor,
although that can be pretty boring. But I
must say, realistically, I don’t think I'll
get there. I love making music. And I
love playing. -
SHOWCASE: Is that going to make you
feel secure? ‘
TAYLOR: , No, the music industry is

' never secure. Each time you go out, you

have the question, will anybody be there?
Will anybody show up to see. me play?
And it's really a big question. I’m always
surprised when people are there to see
me play. ' .
SHOWCA'SE: Do you prefer to do a
one-man - show?

TAYLOR:
myself, because I really don’t like

carrying a band. I make my albums with ’

some of the best players that play, and if I
can't carry them on- the road, if I can’t

afford them, it’s terribly frustrating to ~
carry less than great players. I’m_har,d on _

them and they're hard on me. . \
SHOWCASE: Are you planning another

TAYLOR: I’m in the middle of finishing
one UP» NOW. so it'll be finished very
shortly.

SHOWCASE: You've said that you'd like
to be the president. What platform would

you campaign on? .

TAYLOR: I would revamp the tax

structure. I would tax cash flow, instead

of income, or a combination, perhaps.
But I would deﬁnitely emphasize cash

A flow instead of income tax. which I think

is regressive and foolish. And I feel very

strongly about a guaranteed minimum_

Concerts

 
S.U. Lower Lounge
October 14, 1979

There have been recent complaints
about this- year’s choice for the
Horriecoming concert. That Living-
ston Taylor is not a “better act” seems
untrue and unfair, for Taylor’s brand
of entertainment is not the brand of
other acts. He is “better” at the sort
of show that he puts on, one that
is more diverse than a typical concert.
For in Livingston Taylor’s one-man
show, he generates enough energy to
make one think that he couldn’t
possibly do more for his audience.

For the past six years, Livingston
Taylor has taken hisshow on a circuit
_of clubs and colleges, and has develop-
ed small followings, more as a result of
his performances than of his records.
He believes that his audience wants
more than just a set of good songs, so
he gives them /stories, comedic
interludes of music, and sometimes
poetry. - , ' F

Livingston Taylor is “Liv” to his

. audience, and this familiarity breeds a

healthy interaction. His manner

onstage, _ is intensely elegant,
sometimes. At other times, his
clowning draws attention to a boyish
image that seems to _ convey the
message, “Now let’s have some fun.
Let’s laugh.” Thelyric, “I’m out of
this world,” opened Taylor’s first set
of Homecoming concerts with a note
of immediate interest. He was sharing
a fantasy with the audience, and in
doing so, he was making‘ it possible for
‘them to have that fantasy, too. On the
guitar, Taylor played many of the
songs that have been successful either
on albums or in performances. Among

. these were “L.A. Serenade,” “Going

Round One More Time,” a very strong

I version of “In My Reply,” “I Will Be -

In Love With You,” and “Blackbird.”
There was a pleasant medley of
Woodie Guthrie’s children songs,
‘interspersed with stories of Taylor’s
childhood experiences with Santa
Claus and the U.S. postal service. In
the same vein, Livingston sang “I’ve
Got My Pajamas On,” a delightful
piecewhich describes the joy of being
young {and having the opportunity to
wiggle around with a teddy bear.

When Taylor sat down at the piano,
he. pounded out some dissonant
chords, and said, -“This is a song that
the moving man taught me.” He
managed to make the audience enjoy
the dissonance too, if only for a little
while, as evident by thetremendous
amount of laughter and applause.

Liv played an old favorite, “Get Out
of; Bed,” -with a softness that the
recorded version seems to lack, and
more emphasis on the lyrics.
also included a short song that Taylor

had written for, his dog, and he,
explained that the dedication was?

partly dueto the fact that his dog has
to put up with. the dissonance in
Taylor’s music room. The lyrics are as
simple as the tune:

“Rufus, Rufus, buddy buddy dog.”

When Taylor played a medley of
bluegrass tunes on the banjo his
abilities with the instrument quickly
became evident. He had an amusing
trick of re-tuning the banjo, as he
played, making the tuning process an

integral. part-ofithe melodies. 

The set A

  Ecksteine Family Shine Ati"Daq’s Show

Billy Ecksteine brought his unmistak-

Ecksteine’s baritone voice is still strong _

and his vibrato still resonates. The

. exceptionally rich and ﬁlled the room with

a glowing warmth as she sang the
ballads; “The Last Time I Felt ‘This

touching duet with her father on “You
Don’t Bring Me Flowers.” Less
impressive was her version‘ of Pablo
Cruise's “Love Will Find A Way.” Most
of Gina Ecksteine’s choice of material,
however, was excellent, and her
performance drew a warm response from
the audience. _»

When Billy took the stage again he

“A Young Man With a Horn,” and on
guitar on"‘..Iellyroll’Blues." He brought
back his daughter for another duet
“Dedicated to You,” which concluded an
excellent show.

Ecksteine mentioned that he sings the I

states “good taste runs in the family.”

  Little River Band Are “Firstiunder The Wire” At Stanley

The ‘Little River Band
Stanley Theatre
October 15, 1979

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

“The Little River gBand--Australia's
Best,” said the radio ad. Such an
announcement may immediately turn off
the listener, in an era when the best of
anything is greeted with immediate
suspicion.

Still, the Little River Band have an
impressive record--their catalog includes
both gold and platinum LPs and 455, and
their current tour is selling out just about
everywhere.

The show in Pittsburgh kicked off to an
enthusiastic crowd Monday night, owing
partially to the fact that Glenn Shorrock
made his allegianceto Pittsburgh clear
from the very beginning--“Let’s go
Pirates,” he shouted on the second

_ number, “they’re coming back to win it
all!” '

He also dedicated a ‘song to Willie
Stargell; made continuous references to
the famed Buccos, and just in general
knew what to say to get the crowd on its
feet. But here is a difference from some
bands: Shorrock was serious, as was
learned ~backstage before the show
started--he wanted a Pirate baseball
cap to wear onstage for the -encore. “I
really think they’re going to win it all,”
he said. Talk among fellow bandmembers
touched upon what the scores of the two
remaining Series games would be. It's

nice to meet and see, in concert, e~

musicians who really give a damn about
their audiences, and who .aren’t just out
to“‘snow” an audience out of its seven or
eight bucks (no pun intended.)

numbers as “Share -My Love,” and

.“We Both ,Deserve Each Other’s

Love.” .

Since the ‘Jacksons have not
performed in the Pittsburgh area for
sometime, the sudden reentry ‘of the
band to the top of the pop scene had
the crowd anxiously awaiting their
arrival. The show began with a video
tape sequence of their V’, first
appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show
The flashy,
quick-footed quintet then‘ arrived on
stage, building the energy level left by
LTD. 

The Jacksons performed some of
their biggest hitsispanning their ten-
year /career, including a melody of
“Jackson 5” tunes, among them:
.“AB(},” ‘.‘I Want You Back,” and
“The Love You Save.” Michael
Jackson still handles the lead vocals,
although the group did spotlight solos
on brothers Randy and Marlon.
Michael however still managed to steal
the show on an older mellow hit,
“Ben,” when he floated across the
stage on a small, revolving platform.
Most of the night, however, the
Jacksons had the Arena fans dancing
to such tunes as “Dancin’ Machine”
and Michael’s most recent disco hit,
,“Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough.”

The show mixed well with both the
group’s old and new material. While
most of the crowd walked away, 'or
danced away, satisfied, many felt that
the Jacksons had not performed
enough of their more recent ‘songs
which have catapulted the revitalized
group again into the spotlight of the
music industry. ‘7 . ~  ..

   Bacharac|1’s New Album is Fresh And Vibrant ‘Woman’

By DAVID E. STUBBS

Burt Bacharach and the Houston
_Symphony
''‘.‘Woman’’

._ A&M

“Woman” is the latest album of world

» famous composer, Burt Bacharach. This
‘. album is a classic--a breath of fresh air, to

coin a well known cliche. “Woman is

- one of those albums which can't be placed

in any particular category. The music is

Eat to the Beat

. Blondie

Chrysalis

. Earlier this year, Blondie gained a cer-
tain notoriety as the New Wave band that
scored a number one with the disco single
“Heart of Glass.” While it did crack the
American market for the band, it also

didn't represent their true face. Further, _

the band felt that the super clean
productionprovided by Mike Chapman
presented their music in too slick a
context.

On Blondie’s new album, “Eat To The
Beat,” a Phil Spectorish “wall of sound”
approach to production prev‘ails which
mirrors the band’s infatuation with the
Girl Groups of the early Sixties. Further,
while “Parallel Lines” had consistency, it
lacked the humor and variety of the first
two albums. This void has been filled on
“Eat to the Beat.”

Where “Parallel Lines” stayed in an
almost straight pop/ rock groove we find
more experimentation with style in song
and approach on the new album.

For example, there is the ban,d’,,s,,

I

It reggae send_-up “Die Young Stay Pretty”
which features lyrics like: “Living at

home with your family/dried-up-twigon
your family tree.” Or, there’s the song
“Atomic,” a Disco parody so blatant as to
combat any of the purist’s peeves about
“Heart of Glass.” Finally, ‘there is
“Shayla”—the band’s best effort itt a
ballad yet.

One could go on further and list the

' virtues of all the tracks on the new album.

One ygould also go on about how the less

/restrained solos and the more open use of

different background vocalists instead of
just over-dubbing Deborah Harry con-
tributes to a less clinical sound compared
to “Parallel Lines.” ._ Instead, it’s
probably best to say that on the whole,
this album illustrates Blondie’s current
popularity and why it’s likely to continue.

available. '

There are eight tunes on this album.
Everyone is in itself a “mini symphony.”
The album opens with “Summer of ‘77,”
a sort of Latin sounding upbeat:tune with
a vibrant horn line. “Summer of ‘77” -
sounds a bit like the Bacharach hit
“Promises, Promises, Promises” only
with quite a bit more “spunk.” The
second tune is the title cut, “Woman,” a
slow, melodic tune with the strings,
horns, and piano up front. “Woman” is
followed by “Riverboat,” featuring a
straight forward, performance by vocalist
Libby Titus. The musical arrangement
behind Ms. Titus is marvelous.
middle of this mellow tune it breaks into
six bars of funk and then back to the

 

In the A

original theme- Very innovative.
“Magdelena”/ and “New York Lady”
are sort of like Burt Bacharach’s answer
to jazz. The two tunes are well arranged,
especially the horns and rhythm section.
Woodwindist John Phillips, is featured on
both songs. Phillips does some nice
saxophone work on both songs and a
surprising oboe solo on “Magdelena.”
The obeo is sort of the forgotten
instrument in the woodwind line but
Bacharachllwrites a well deserved part
here. “New York Lady” comes off very
funky, a side of Bacharach which has
never really been heard before. The song
absolutely grooves! .
“There is Still’ Time” and “_Dancing
Fool” are .more familiar tunes from

touching performance is done by Carly
Simon on the song “I Live _In ‘The
Woods.” The lyrics reﬂect the cynical

again. »

“Woman” is the kind of album that
people have ‘been waiting for from
Bacharch. Unfortunately, since the

_ album covers such a wide variety of style

and doesn’t ﬁt into any speciﬁc category,
it probably won't get a lot of radio airplay.

      Blondie’s New ‘Eat To ‘lite Beat’: A Better Tasiing-A|bum  

 

  Lowe's ‘Lust’ And Edward's ‘Repeat’: Genre Of PoweriPop  

By GEORGE SI-IANER

Labour of Lust

’ Nick Lowe
‘ . Columbia

Repeat When Necessary

Dave Edmunds

Swan Song

The New Wave is more successful on
the American charts than it has ever
been because of the genre of Power
Pop. Power.Pop is the combination of

straight forward melodies and vocals .

with upfront guitars and lyrics, -which
display a varying mix of smartness and
cynicism, that appeared after the initial
blast of the New Wave. . .

i Unfortunately, Power Pop has been

..,o _
‘.-

\

one of the most abused terms in music

and has‘ been used to encompass '

groups ranging from little-known

English rockers like the Buzzcocks and .
XTC to current American superstars,

like the Cars and Cheap Trick.

Perhaps the best example of. the
genre is the collaboration of Nick
Lowe and Dave Edmunds.

Lowe and Edmunds have been
partners ever since Edmunds produced
Lowe's old band Brinsley Schwarz,
and have been playing together since
the foundation of Stiff Records in
1976/77. While no longer associated
with‘Stiff,‘Lowe and Edmunds still
share the same management and have
never been closer.

This «is exemplified by the
simultaneous re ‘-29 of their new

albums “Labour Of Lust” and‘
-“Repeat - When Necessary” in an
attempt to cover the pop spectrum.

“Labour Of Lust” is Lowe's second
solo "release and presents a more
coherent picture than last years “Pure
Pop_Fo_r New People” which was a

it 3 collection of previously ‘released
' English singles. This is not to say that

Lowe has stinted on variety this time
around. The songs on “Labour of
Lust” range from “Cruel To Be Kind”

and “American Squirm,” 60s styled

;pop melodies with 70s sentiments, to
light acoustic tracks like “You Make
Me.” However, the most distinct
trend on this album is the continued
input of- Edmunds’ blues and

rockability roots in songs -like‘ ,“Switch_. . s

Board Suisan” and “Born Fighter”
which dominate the second side. ‘

A Before Edmunds became strongly
involved with Lowe, he was a rock’n’
roll revivalist best known for the single
“I Hear You"Knocking.” Edmunds
has since provided the guitar backbone
for _Lowe’s music while taking on more
pop influences as shown on his
rendition of Elvis‘ Costello’s “Girls
Talk.” However, “Repeat -When
Necessary” makes the best of fifties
rock sound like it never lost relevance.
-Eventually, when Edmunds’ current
‘contract with Swan Song expires, we
will see the first ‘full-fledged rockpile
album with Nick Lowe and Dave
Edmunds. That’s when the perfect
pop/ rock mixture will appear. '

delayed due to the unexpected financial
success of “Budokan.” The album
contains nine typical Cheap Trick
compositions. The title tune is already
on its way to becoming a smash hit single.
“Gonna Raise Hell” is a slow, intense
rocker that features Rick Nielsen
jamming for much of the song’s nine
minutes and 18 seconds. “Voices” is a
mellower rock love ballad which to an
extent breaks some new ground but still
retains that unmistakable Cheap Trick
style. And the studio version ‘of “Need

sounding almost indistinguishable from
the live version found on “Budokan.”

energetic rockers with the emphasis on
harmony and catchy melodies. Tom
Werman again produces the album.

The second and third Cheap Trick
albums, “In Color” and ‘.‘Heaven
Tonight,” featured a clean, crisp studio
mix. Their ﬁfth release, “Dream Police”
is much more spontaneous and “live,”
closer in overallsound to the live “At
Budokan.” And the material is
consistently good, running a close second
behind their finest album to date, “In
Color.”
