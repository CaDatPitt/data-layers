Pitt-Penn State football rivalry will end in 1992

By Mike Rampa

Sports Editor

First there was no open alcohol allowed
around Pitt Stadium. Then there was no
tailgating permitted in the Syria Mosque
parking lot. Now there will no longer be a
Pitt-Penn State football rivalry after the
1992 season.

Penn State has said that there is no room
for Pitt on its football schedule. It cited
“severe contractual problems” in the mid-
1990s, primarily because of its recent entry
into the Big T en Conference, as the principal
reason for its decision to interrupt the 98-

year-old series.

Penn State said it might resume the
series in the future, but no timetable has
been established. The Pitt-Penn State
contract was a 10-year deal which will
expire in 1992.

Pitt President Wesley Posva-r was
informed last Thursday of the decision by
Penn State President Joab Thomas.

“We recognize that Penn State has been
forced to make substantial changes in
their football schedule as a result of
conference commitments. We, too, have
had to modify our schedules to
accommodate our entry into the Big East

football conference,” Posvar said.

“Over the past several months the Pitt
department of athletics has suggested
scheduling alternatives which we think
would have enabled both teams to find
mutually acceptable dates for future games.
None were found to be acceptable by
Penn State,” .Posvar added.

One of those proposals involved moving
the game to the beginning of the season to
avoid new league conflicts.

A proposal which has been mentioned
in the past was for Pitt to give Penn State
two games at Beaver Stadium in exchange
for one in Oakland. According‘ to Pitt

Athletic Director Ed Bozik, that proposal
was not discussed.

The series began in 1893, and the schools
have played a total of 90 games since then.
Penn State leads the series 45-41-4. The
last time the two schools did not play was
in 1934. Only 13 other Division I rivalries
have exceeded the 90 meetings of Pitt and
PSU.

“The danger now is that there will be a
permanent cessation of this time—honored
rivalry which began in 1893. It will be far
more difficult to reinstate the series once
each of us has made future commitments,”
Posvar said.

Ethnic food, music and crafts created a festive atmosphere at
Pitt’s 12th annual Latin American and Caribbean Folk Festival.

The festival, held Saturday at Forbes Quadrangle, was
sponsored by Pitt’s Center for Latin American Studies.

There were handmade crafts for sale, such as sweaters, shirts,
jewelry, dolls, weavings, paper and piﬁatas.

Traditional food, including tacos, tamales, ﬂan and black
beans and rice was sold in booths run by local restaurants and
cultural groups.

Several political groups encouraged awareness of problems

faraway lands at the International
Career Fair held at Pitt last
Thursday and Friday.

The fair, sponsored by the Study
Abroad Office and Students
Around the World, was a two-day
seminar on international careers,
student services and graduate and
professional schools within the
international arena.

Practicing professionals came

questions about how to ﬁnd a job
overseas,” said Tracy Seeley, vice
president of Students Around the
World.

“It’s very, very difficult [to find
jobs overseas], and today students
were able to come here and talk
to people and get some ideas,”
Seeley said.

Pitt’s Placement Service
sponsors a career fair in the fall,
but it is not geared toward
international careers, according
to Seeley.

The International Career Fair 

tried to show students what
opportunities exist on campus
and what kind of contacts they
can make off campus.

According to Michael Fekete,
business manager of Students
Around the World, a lot of
students are hesitant to get
involved in the international scene
because they don’t feel they have
foreign-language qualifications.
He said that students need to
know that with some under-
graduate preparation, such as
Pitt’s certiﬁcate program, they can
qualify to work internationally.

The fair was geared mostly
toward freshmen and soph-
omores so that they could get a
focus for the rest of their
undergraduate studies.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, April 15. 1991

. Pitt researchers are using

rockets to study environmental

problems such as the greenhouse
effect and ozone depletion.
Professors Edward Zipf and
Peter W. Erdman, both Pitt
physicists, are leading a series of
rocket launches, projects and
experiments to study the
thermosphere (atmosphere at

 " very high altitudes). '

In support of the Upper

if 1 Atmosphere Research Satellite,

which the space shuttle will place
into orbit next November, ‘at least

I 12 rockets will be launched over
the next three years.

The UARS project is expected
to last 5 to 6 years and is the
precursor to a series of satellites
thatwill be launched late in the
next decade.

These satellites are a part of
the Earth Observation System, a
$3 billion effort by NASA.
According to Zipf, EOS has been

called “return to planet Earth.” '

He said that today’s technology is
being used to stop tomorrow's
ecological trends.

“This is a very people-oriented
satellite,” he said, adding that the
efforts of the satellite are
concerned with humankind and
what humans are "doing to
themselves. :

Pitt’s launches are supported
by NASA, which awards grants of
$200,000 a year for the UARS
project.

This represents 20 percent of
NASA’s total rocket launches over
the next 36 months.

Zipf, along with other members
of Pitt's Aeronomy Group, will
launch the rockets from various
locations. _

These locations include Esrange
in Kiruna, Sweden; a mobile site
in Brazil; White Sands Missile
Range in New Mexico; and Poker
Flat, Alaska. , A

The payload, a type of rocket
developed by the group,
cryogenicallycollects whole air
samples during ﬂight. These are

then analyzed at the Space

Research Coordination Center on
the Oakland campus. This will
provide data as part of NASA’s
correlative measurement
program.

Zipf’s group works on
launching rockets but also spends
time in the laboratory. “There is
almost a dialogue between the
two," he said.

“We fly rockets designed to
[solve] certain problems.
Sometimes by accident we solve
another problem that is important.
It's a clue to something else you
are thinking of, a welcome but
unanticipated discovery proven
to be fruitful over the years,” he
said.

Pitt's Aeronomy Group is also
involved in two other field
programs in addition to the UARS

and global-warming projects. A,

$500,000 grant was awarded to
Zipfs team from "the Department
of Defense to perform plasma
physics experiments in the upper
atmosphere.

The group will also launch a

Strypi XI rocket in a joint effort:

7liiResearchers use rockets to study environrnent

 By Chrissy Cullen

with Utah State University in order
to study the radiation and heat
produced by shock waves when
an object enters the atmosphere,
The group has also received a
three-year, $480,000 NASA grant
to study the effects of the sun on
the upper atmosphere (100 to
300 kilometers above the earth)
through the data which was
gathered by the rockets launched
in Alaska and New Mexico.
Zipfs‘ team first got involved
with NASA when it received a
research announcement
describing NASA’s needs. Zipf
and his team then wrote its
proposal stating how it wanted to
approach the situation. The
proposal then went through
agency and review panels and
was mailed back with NASA’s
reply.
“In many ways, this is a
business," said Zipf. “It is a more
ﬂexible way of handling the

' dollars.”

Zipf, who launched his first
rocketin 1960, said, “If you launch
a rocket well, it is a sense of joy."

Union” last week at Pitt. ,
"The Soviet Union is facing a
variety of crises today, according
to Mandel. These include
economic, social, ideological and
political crises, he said.
“It is common knowledge that

' the Soviet Union has been going

through a period of unsystematic
crisis which creates [Mikhail]
Gorbachev’s reforms andexplains
them,” Mandel said. .
Mandel said that an additional
systematic Soviet failure is “the
inability of the system to switch

from extensive to‘ intensive

industrialization, and its failure to

catch up with the great specific

‘pace of the third technological

revolution.”
The military has suffered from
this failure, Mandel said.

“The Soviet military technology.

now hasa five-year gap with the:
American technology,” Mandel
said.

The Soviet crisis of legitimacy
is often overlooked, Mandel said.

“There is a political, moral and
ideological crisis,” Mandel said.
“Gorbachev, himself, in his book
on perestroika, makes a .general
remark which again shows this
loss ‘of legitimacy in the
mechanisms of power in an
industrial society.” ‘

“Gorbachev writes, ‘People are
so convinced of the lack of

that when accidentally [Soviet]
television does say the truth, the
people don’t believe it," said
Mandel. “The people don’tbelieve
it because they start on the
assumption that everything [on]
television is a lie.”

Mandel said that the Soviet
people’s anger is even directed
towards the higher-education
system, which has become
restrictive.

“The state budgets [had]
declined, and it was not possible
any more for most of the students
who wanted to go to the university
to go there.._'Ihere was severe
competition, one of the severest
in the world. Parents were very
angry,” Mandel said.

Blacks in Corporate America...,if

By Tammy R. Poole
Staﬁ" Wﬁter

Statistics show that
approximately seven out of
10 African—American
students at Pitt do not
graduate. .

But for at least on
African—American Pitt
student, these statistics have
not been discouraging;
rather, they have provided
her with the extra incentive
to succeed.

On April 28 at
approximately 4 p.m.,
apprehension will be the
last thing on the’ mind of
Tricia Graham as she takes
her ﬁnal steps down the
University of Pittsburgh
road.

The post-war recession
and job-market competition
do not hinder Graham from
facing today’s working
world.

On the other hand, she
says she is quite optimistic
and will push even harder
to achieve. ,

“It is going to be
extremely difficult for

_African-Americans,
especially because we have
to be twice as good to make
it in corporate America,”

Pitt leaders offer advice to black

By Tammy R. Poole
Staff Writer

In the March/April 1991 issue
of the Blade Collegian Magazine,
an article entitled “Employment
Opportunities for African-
Americans in the 21st Century"
raised the question of how

African-Americans can pursue

careers in corporate America.
William C. Brooks, author of

that article and group director of _

personnel for the General Motors
Corporation's Truck and Bus
Group, answered the question in
his article by writing:

“We can by both proudly
retaining our special strengths
and perspective and by being
agents for changing a hard
corporate structure. In other
words, by both demonstrating
individual achievement and
fostering collective progress.”

When the same ._question_ was

asked to several African—American
faculty members at the University
of Pittsburgh, each expressed an
opinion based on past
experiences. Each also offered
advice on how African—American
graduates in 1991 can succeed in
their specialized fields of study.
“The basic recommendation
that I would make is the need to
focus on the highest possible
attainment in whatever you
undertake,” said Jack Daniel,
associate provost at Pitt. “The
first thing is to develop
quantitative skills — at a minimal,
calculus. Always remember that
calculus is one of the primary
intellectual gatekeepers for the

21st century. Most of the-

disciplinary backgrounds for the
corporate setting require such
quantitative skills.-"

Daniel also stressed that success
for African-American graduates

begins with the contributions that

are made to the African-American

“Of equal importance for
African—Americans is the need to

keeping their African‘cu1tural
origins at the center of their
existence,” said Daniel. “Finally,
it is my personal view that an
African—American cannot be
successful in the corporate setting

Slova/e group examines gypsy

By Virginia Bi_'OWIl

suqr Writer

’The history and culture of gypsies was the
subject of the third annual Thomas Kukucka
Memorial Award lecture and Slovak Student
Award presentation.

' The event was sponsored by the Slovak
studies program and the Slovak Club. Terrence
Kaufman, a professor in the anthropology and

‘ linguistics departments at Pitt, lectured on the
topic “The Arrival of the Gypsies in Europe."

Following along with the theme of gypsies,
Miso and Lida Suchy presented a lecmre, a slide
presentation entitled “Survivors: Photographs of
Gypsies in Slovakia” and a documentary film
called, Dzbavas Mange Dlugone Dromeba (I
Came Up a Long Road). The three presentations
explored the daily lives of the gypsy population
in Eastern Slovakia.

The film followed Suchy through a gypsy
village, capturing distinctive scenes of daily life.
It was awarded Best Documentary at the Film
Festival Cadca in 1988.

Miso Suchy traced his fascination with the
gypsies to childhood.memories of traveling long
distances to visit his grandfather in eastern

culture

Slovakia.

Suchy’s ﬁlm gave an insight into the gypsies
and their way of life. “It’s our very personal
experiences with the gypsies,” Suchy said.

Miso was born in Czechoslovakia in 1965 and
studied visual documentary at the College of
Higher Muses in Bratislava. His wife, Lida, was
born in North Dakota in 1960. She received her
bachelor's degree in anthropology from the
State University of New York at Albany and her
master's degree in communications from Syracuse
University.

After the presentations the recipients of Slovak
Student Scholarship Awards were honored.

“The Slovak scholarship is possible due to
private funds, and any student who has taken
Slovak for two semesters is eligible,” said Martin
Vortruba.

Constance Cherok, Michael Cuchran, Jacinta
Dvorak, Roberta Kunkle, Linda Lipchak, Barbara
Jean Mima, Donna Mima, Kathryn Rudolph and
David Stock were awarded scholarships.

The Thomas Kukucka Memorial Award was
presented to Barbara Jean Mirna. This award is
for students who wish to study in Czechoslovakia
and was set up in order to help defray the costs
of travel..

aspects of the 18th century,” said
Professor Philip Koch. -“It’s an
interdisciplinary organization. It
tries to show or  examine what
is common in the 18th-century
mentality in different countries,
in different artistic disciplines.”

At each seminar, three or four
papers pertaining to that seminar’s
topic are presented. Koch said,
“In addition to these seminars,
we had plenary meetings in which
the local planning committee
chose A outstanding scholars who
would speak to the assembled
attendees."

Koch said, “The seminars serve
two functions. They are to present
original ideas on  the topics of
the seminar. These specific new
ideas will help people working
in "those special areas. But in

addition, they are opportunities

for people who are not directly
involved in these specific areas
to learn a little bit more about
other aspects of the 18th century.
This is the interdisciplinary idea.”
The goal of this annual meeting,
according to Koch, was “to
illuminate both experts in the
ﬁeld and those who have a
curiosity about particular subjects
on which they are. not expert.”

Festival

Continued from page 1
the Latin American Children’s
Fund and the Pittsburgh
Committee for Health Rights in
Central America were among
these groups.

Frank Smith, a member of the
Committee for Health Rights, said
that the festival has become a

' yearly event for his group.

“We raise money for
humanitarian projects in Central
America. We have a walk-a—thon
every year, and we have a work-

» a-thon this year. "Basically, ‘WC

raise money for health plans, like
community—based health projects

‘mainly in Nicaragua and El

Salvador," said Smith.

The other political groups that
participated are trying to bring
human rights and political
freedom to the people of Central
and South American countries
through fund raising, political
awareness and boycotts of
products such as Salvadoran
coffee.

LatinoAmeriCanta, one of the
musical groups featured in the
festival, played Latin American
protest songs. ,

"A few of the other groups
featured were Cantios, a folklore

‘grou p from Venezuela, Caribbean

Vibes, a Caribbean. steel band;
and Guaracha, which played salsa
and merengue music.

Children attending the festival
had the opportunity to have their
faces painted and to participate
in the breaking of candy—filled

‘ piﬁatas.

Theresa Starr, who lived in

Panama for three years while her ‘

husband was stationed in the
military there, said she enjoyed
the festival.

“You get a little bit of each
different country in one place,”

' she said.

Bloomer

Continued from page 3
receptor-containing cancer
cells.

One of the most recent
developments made by
Bloomer and his research
assistants is the
development of new
synthesizers for radiation
and ' chemotherapy

specifically for poorly-

oxygenated tumor cells.
Bloomer is well—respected
among his peers.
George M. Bernier Jr.,

‘dean of the university's

School of Medicine, said,
“Bill Bloomer is a multi-
faceted leader who is a real
triple threat in terms of
patient care, teaching and
research." _

“It was only four years
ago that we were lucky
enough to woo Dr. Bloomer
away from the highly
regarded radiotherapy
program at Mount Sinai
Medical Center to perform
similar miracles here for the
School of Medicine and the
PittsburghCancerInstitute,”
said Dr. Thomas Detre,
president of the University
Medical Center.

Along with his position as
chairperson in the
department of radiation
oncology, Bloomer is also
associate director of the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.
His work with the institute
and his university research
go hand in hand, according
to Bloomer.

All the cancer—related
activities co—ordinated by the
PCI are closely related to
the research at
university, he said.

Another honor recently
given‘ to Bloomer is his
appointment to the. Claude

Worthington Benedum "

Professorship and Chair in
Radiation Oncology.

This endowment, worth
$1.5 million, was donated
by the board of directors of
University Radiotherapy
Associates, Inc., and will go
into the University of
Pittsburgh endowmentfund
to further educational and
research activities.

over the years.

For Graham’s outstanding

“You may make it through the

you may have to come back for a
second, third or final interview
before the hiring process actually
comes into play,” said Graham.

“As long as you are aware of
the stages and the steps that you

have a problem.

"You have to prepare for the

Director opposes QPA's

By Cheryl Benson
For The Pitt News

Robert Hopkins, director of Pitt's
placement office, is against the members
of the Quality Personnel Advocacy program
separating from the placement office.

QPA existed under the placement office
for three years.

Until this year, Hopkins’ assistant gave
job—related workshops and (acted as a
guidance counselor and role model for

' minority students.

Since Hopkins’ assistant is no longer
with the placement office, Hopkins had to
assume more responsibility for the
program.

Hopkins said that he could not assume
the same role as his assistant, an African-
American, and be as effective because of
racial differences between himself and
minority members.

Hopkins viewed the inability to identify
with black sensibilities or to become a role
model for minorities as causing resistance
by some students.

In order to maintain ties with the
students, Hopkins initiated student
involvement.

Hopkins said he is unaware of the
problems the QPA members have with
the placement office.

Hopkins is also disillusioned about
the possible break from the placement

split from placement offic

office.

“I don’t like the sound of it,” Hopkins
said.

He said that it will be difficult for members

to totally separate the program from the
placement office. '
' "‘You don’t break it away from the
people that started it unless they want to
let it go. I’m not about to abandon the
population,” he said.

The placement office is responsible for
all publicity and organizing, as well as
maintaining and initiating ideas, according
to Hopkins.

He said it is difficult to reach any one
specific population.

Promoting the program is a special

challenge for this reason, according to

Hopkins. I
“Publicity began as adequate last year,

and it’s getting better,” said Hopkins. if

Hopkins is concerned about the ,

members attempting to separate from the
office.

“They could set up in competition, but
in order to be successful we have to work
cooperatively," Hopkins said. '

“Separating would be self:defeating.
By working together, the placement office
and the QPA members could accomplish
more, and in time both groups could reap
beneﬁts from working together. No one
can do it any better at the moment," he
said. '

said Daniel, who was once the
chairperson of the black studies
department.

I “In addition to this commitment
to the African—American struggle,
it was mandatory that I have
well—developed administrative
skills,” he said. '
William Harmon, vice president
of student affairs, said that in

it’s job satisfaction, ” said Harmon.
“But the most important is job
satisfaction, because if you enjoy
what you do, then there is a
tendency to want to just throw
yourself completely into your
job.” \

Dennis Brutus, chairperson of
the black studies" department, said
that African—American§ need to
be prepared to be very

competitive in corporate America.

“The reality is that the U.S.
economy is in bad shape,” said
Brutus.

“This means that there will be
more layoffs and fewer jobs, and
blacks will have an even more
difficult time trying to get
promotions in the corporate
world. Racism is likely to
intensify,” he said.

order to attain success in
corporate America, one must
research whatever material is
needed and become familiar with
its necessities and requirements.

“Well, I think that it is important
to research the information that
is involved with corporate
America today by talking to
individuals working in specific
arealsl of interest and
understanding what is involved
in the educational process,” said
Harmon. _

Harmon said that personally,
he has maintained specific goals
in his career which allowed space
to broaden his capabilities, skills
and talents. '

“I thinkthat the most important
parts are discipline and
perseverance,” said Harmon. “As
far as my own personal
experiences are concerned, Ihave
basically set goals for myself in
terms of my own
accomplishments and didn’t place
any limitations. No one should
set limitations for themselves.”

Limitations prohibit a person
from achieving the success that
he or she wants to attain,
according to Harmon.

“Success is in an individualized
achievement, and whatever the
person sees as important or
successful is what the individual
should strive for. For some
people, it“ is money; for others,

According to Mandel, “There
are four possible outcomes of
these crises. One is the restoration
of the old type of post-Stalin
dictatorship. The second possible
outcome is the restoration of
capitalism. The third possible
outcome is the self-reform of the
bureaucracy and the success of
the Gorbachev experiment. The
fourth possible outcome is what
I call in the jargon of my own
organization — that jargon is
now widely used by Gorbachev
himself —— political evolution."

Yet, Mandel added, “I think
none of the four has any chance
of being realized.”

 ' Since January 16, I've sat back and watched

in‘ wide—eyed amazement as the revisionist
historian element in American society has twisted
the designs of American foreign policy around

l._ _. to suit its nonsensical socio-political values. I've
V Watched’ countless protests here on campus

and heard a few too many whine-fests by long-
haired leftovers from the 1960s that have in-
variably deteriorated into diatribes against the

United States with a “historical analysis” tilt to

them. I "

A .° Some of the more popular accusations include
J’ thej§‘“fact” that we've spent the postwar years

doing nothing for the world beyond attacking

helpless and democratic regimes that we’ve
‘J found to  unkind to U.S. business interests.
“The two best examples of this are Vietnam and
' Cliile. ' ‘ '

Or are they? Has anyone ever thought to look

‘beneath the veneer of these accusations for
what could be the truth?

,Let’s examine the situation in Vietnam 20 to

 30 years ago. Common fallacy: T be United States
 waged an illegal imperialist war against a

derrjzocratic nationalistgovernment because°tbe
United States was egged on by business interests.
Sorry, I hate to bring the modern crop of stupid
airheads down to earth, but the war involved an
ardent communist-from-minute-one insurgency
whose aim was to take over a country that had

 more fertile land, a more prosperous economy
and_ thriving infrastructure than it had. In 1956

Tom Lester

the Geneva Accords temporarily divided Viet-
nam at the 17th parallel, but within weeks of the
agreement Ho Chi Minh’s legions had started a
massive buildup of the insurgency against
Saigon. By 1967 South Vietnam had become
democratic under Nguyen Van Thieu, while
North Vietnam had become. a bastion of to-
talitarianism and militarism. (It had the 4th-
largest army in the world between 1966 and

l 1976.) Yet the United States to this day is

denounced as the aggressor.
Three weeks ago, Ramsey Clark alluded to

the savagery of U.S. air attacks on civilians in ~
V Hanoi and Haiphong during Linebacker II.

Unfortunately, he, Jane Fonda and dozens of
journalists who toured the bomb-damaged ar-
eas in January 1974 have since been pro_ven to
have been duped by Hanoi and Peking. Le Duc
Tho has often said that their reactions were
great propaganda victories that led to the U.S.
pullout in 1975, despitethe fact that civilian
casualties were extremely low.

The Chilean situation has been similarly bas- '

“ tardized. Common fallacy: Ybe U.S.ove11brewa

popular democratic president (Allende) and

placed a murderous general in bis stead '

(Pinocbet). Reality: Allende barely won in 1970

but promised to obey the Constitution and \

guarantee everyone’s civil rights. Between 1971 I
and 1973, Allende confiscated all private ‘

property, killed those who opposed his efforts,
released leftist M.I.R. terrorists and disbanded
the congress in favor of his handpicked “People’s
Assembly.”

The military, made up of strict constitution-
alists (a rarity in South America), reacted to
these illegal actions by trying to oust Allende,
something even his Communist allies couldn’t
do by planting bombs in his office. With the
support of the United States, the military
overthrew Allende, and Pinochet stepped in.
Contrary to popular opinion, nobody suspected
that Pinochetwouldn’t remain democratic. Even
so, Pinochet rapidly stabilized Chile’s society
and economy and finally stepped down in favor
of democracy in 1989, all without threats of the

discontinuation of U.S. "aid because Pinochet.

immediately refused U.S. aid in 1973. Eighteen
years later, Chile is much better off than it was
under Allende’s regime.- ’
Please keep these two examples in mind the
next time a two—bit hack like Ramsey Clark

accusesus of wantonly murdering civilians in .

Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador or Iraq. People
like him, CISPES, the LaRouchies and the
commies all have an axe to grind against
America and will say anytbingto getyour mind,
soul and — most importantly — your money.

f .Welfare, farm subsidies roots of poverty

. Last month some disturbing sta-

tistics-w.ere*re1eased by the Food

. cording to their study, one out of
 every eight children in the United
' States- does not get enough food.

Usually when such studies are

 - "published, most of the major news

media call out for more welfare
payments.

For example, in the April 6 Post-
Gazette, columnist James E. Casto
criticized the federal government
for not spending enough on the
Supplemental Food Program for
Women, Infants and Children.

My‘ opinion is that welfare, in the

of poverty. Welfare encourages
unwed women and teenagers to
have babies that they are often not
able to properly care for. Welfare

also discourages people from
seeking employment and becom-
ing upwardly mobile, and welfare
also hurtstaxpayers, many of whom
are poor. \
People who support’ welfare
would like us to think that they
care about the poor and hungry.
What I wonder is, if supporters
of welfare care so much about the
problem of hunger, then how come

the vast majority of them never '

criticize federal farm_ programs
which increase the price of food?
For example, in 1941 the federal
government issued peanut permits.

have oneiof these permits. Since
1941, these permits have been
handed down from generation to
generation, and no new permits
have been issued. This protects
peanut farmers from competition,
and by limiting the peanut supply,
it makes them more expensive.
Other federal farm programs,
such as farm subsidies, marketing
orders and trade barriers, increase
the pricesof other foods. . ,
Thanks to these programs, we
pay higher prices forsuch items as

dairy products, orange juice, bread ‘

and cereal. _

According to the June 1990 issue
of Reader’sDigest, during the 1980s
federal farm programs cost us $260
billion in higher taxes and food
prices. This is more than $4,000 for
a family of four.

As a percentage of income, the
poor spend more money on food
than anybody else. The“ poor are
the biggest victims of these federal
farm programs.

If the people who support wel-
fare are truly trying to help the

' poor and hungry, then why is it

that most of them never speak out
against federal farm programs?

Ithink I can answer that. Speaking
"out in favor of welfare is a popular
thing to do. People who favor
welfare’ are viewed as “compas—
sionate.” I

But criticizing federal farm pro-
grams is not viewed in this light. It
just doesn’t get the same kind of
publicity.

The easiest way to help _the
hungry of this nation would be to
abolish every single federal farm
program. But to a large degree, the
news media have chosen to ignore
this idea. Instead, they want more
money for welfare. '

Lisa.Raff’s lament for the “good ol’ days” in
[April 9’s] perspective section was a real kick.
Maybe I’m the one who's pining for the past,
but I'd expect a newspaper editorial on some-
thing like the Kinko’s decisionto be full of
righteous indignation rather than whining self-
pity. ~ -

Copyright laws in this country are supposed
to balance the rights of authors to protect their
writings and those of information consumers to
enjoy reasonable and limited use of copyrighted
material. A good copyright law ought to protect
economic incentives to create "and publish
books and journal‘ articles, while at the same
time ensuring that readers aren’t unnecessarily
restricted in their efforts to access those works.

Personally, I believe that reproduction of
materials for educational purposes is fair use,
since I don't see that it has much impact on the
value of or market for the works being repro-
duced. I suspect that the textbook publishers
who sued Kinko's were more interested in
protecting the value of their own (highly
overpriced) texts rather than those that were
going into the classroom packets.

Not everyone agrees with me,‘ however. A
_U.S. district court has sided with the copyright
holders (in good faith, I believe, despite Ms.
Raffs accusations of a draconian government
conspiring to destroy the educational system).
But whether you come down on the side of
authors or readers, I should hope the debate
would be over issues of access and property
righ_ts. Stop sniveling about how convenient
Kinko’s was, and forget the childish complaints
about courts “taking away our right to learn."

Clark saw Iraq ﬂrsthand .
I am shocked by Robert E. Lewis’  “Clark’s
comments must not be taken seriously” letter to

the editor in the March 25 779ePittNews. Mr. Lewis

chastises TbePittNews, contending that the paper
disregarded statements of the administration’
and. the military, ignoring that it was they who

brainwashed Americans with absolute control p ,

over the media for several months. Mr. Lewis
then goes on to malign Ramsey Clark for his

actions in opposition to the Vietnam War. I can ‘ ‘

sense his implication that Ramsey Clark and his

kind were responsible for the U.S. losing that if

war. . _
Ramsey Clark observed — firsthand — the

aftermath of the U.S.—led bombings of their-.

country on thousands of Iraqi victims, yet Mr.
Lewis advisesfus not to take this seriously. Mr.
Lewis demonstrates to me some kind of retarded
sense of morality. I wonder if those Germans
who objected to Hitler’s aggression were accused
by their countrymen of being traitors?

 It is apparent that there are several architects

of the media who are quick to deny that the
expression “might makes right" is a moral
precept in America. Is patriotism defined in
terms of blindly supporting the means by which
greater wealth is attained by a few and disparity
in the world is reinforced? With more weapons

dangerous for values to be based on power as

justifications and motives in the bombinglof
other people, these people seem to have akind '
of guilt in the first place‘ about not being
Americans. Our news reports of America at war
in the Persian Gulf were the beginning format
for the most expensive movie ever produced. It
was planned and propagandized as a war that
succeeded in brainwashing Americans into
supporting U.S. action, which in reality consti-
tuted the bombing of self-determined Arabs
into submission to pave the way for future
American and Israeli designs.[...l

By J ohn Labriola
Staﬂ“ Writer \-

The men's tennis team closed
out its season yesterday with a
performance much akin to last
Monday's a loss to Edinboro
University, In the process, itfailed
to achieve its record 14th win in
one season, finishing at 13-10.

The Panthers suffered / a 9-0
shutout at the hands of ' the
University of Buffalo Bulls in the
Cost Center in just under four
hours.

The competition opened with
singles and progressed into
doubles. Pitt’s No. 1 seed Eric
Weaver lost to Rob Gregoric 6-2,
6-1.

Following Weaver’s defeat was
No. 2 seed Larry Gerrard, who
lost to John I.aBianco (6-3, 6-4).

“It was afgood match,” said

_ LaBianco. “I was lucky I got ahead
early in the first set, and I held on.
Both of us were serving well.
[Gerrard's] a very good net player.
I-’Ie’s very aggressive."

Jeff Mills was the next member
of the Panther team tofall. No. 3
seed John Lavere beat Mills 6-4,
6-8, 6-3.’

Pitt’s fourth seed, John Te gano,
gave Rob Whitbred a run for his

- money. In the end, Whitbred
came out the winner 7-5, 6-4.

“This court is a very distinctly
different surface from what we
are used to playing on,” said
Whitbred. “This is the only time
we play on an Astro-Turf surface

I the entire year, and it is totally
different. We simply can’t prepare
for it, so coming in here Pitt has
a very distinct home-court
advantage. '

“As a result, John knew how to
play the court a lot better than I
did. Basically I had to turn to a

war of attrition, a bloo_d-and-guts,
whoever-niisses-first match. I was
lucky that he grnissed ta: _couple
more shots than I’ did,”:added
Whitbred. ‘ ,_

‘ Pitt’s No. 5 seed followed in his

_ teammates’ footsteps ;and_ was

defeated 6-0, 6-4 1 "the: Bull_s’
Tony Tringali. -V , - { f

The ﬁnal loss for the “Panther
singles ' team came when Joel‘
Orth fell to Dave Hunter. Orth
started out the match with a 6-2
win, but Hunter came back in the
second (6-2) and third (6-1) sets
to win.

“I found Joel to be ‘a really top
tennis player. He had great court
speed and is really solid on both
sides,” said Hunter. “I had a tough
time during the first set adjusting.
You could tell thatjoel had played
here before, and I hadn’t. After
the second set I. made- some
adjustments to the turf,- and it
helped me out."

The second ' leg of the
competition‘ opened with Pitt’s
No. 3—seed doubles team, Tegano
and'O’Connor, losing to the Bulls’
Kevin Humphrey and Lavere in
two sets (6-4, 6-2). ,

Next to fall was the NO, 1—seed

team of Weaver and Mills to =

Gregoric and LaBianco (6-1, 6-1).
“[The Buffalo doubles team] was
really consistent and very
aggressive,” said Weaver. .

The final Panther team, to fall
was the No. 2—seed team of
Gerrard and Orth to Steve

‘Courtwright and Whitbred in two

sets 6-3 and 6-4.
“Joel and I had a good match

today,” said Gerrard. “We gave it .

all that we had, and we did well.”

Nelson, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus

and. the latest edition —- Tom‘

Watson. All of these players made
it to the No. 12 hole, the second
of the famed “Amen Corner” at
Augusta National Golf Club in
Augusta, Ga., hoping to win golf-‘s
most prestigious tournament, only
to have their hopes dashed by an
innocent—looking hole that has
slain even the greatest golfers of
all time.

This seemingly innocent par—3
is the one that seems to make or
break the eventual winner every
year. This year’s winner, Ian
Woosnam, and Watson entered
neck and neck.

Woosnam came into his fourth

Masters seeking his first major
tournament win. Despite being
ranked No. 1 in the world,
Woosnam has never garnered
the respect of either the press. or
his fellow competitors. Many
believe that Nick Faldo, winner
of last year’s British Open and
the past two Masters tournaments,
should rank above Woosnam
based on Faldo’s performance.
However, while Woosnam has
not won the so-called “majors,”
he has won numerous
tournaments in America, Europe
and Australia. He led Watson by
one stroke when they entered
play on Sunday and appeared to
be in the driver’s seat following
the turn at nine.

However, after two holes of
play on the back side, Watson

appeared to have the momentum '

on his side, and Woosnam’s hold

on the top spot seemed to be
faltering. At this hole, "Watson
put his tee shot into the drink
directly in front of the hole, and
Woosnam hit the center of the
green. Woosnam escaped with a
par; Watson limped home with a
double bogey. ‘

After this hole, Watson seemed
to make a charge. After Woosnam
pulled his tee shot on the par 5,
No. 13 into the creek that runs
parallel to the left-hand side of
the fairway, Watson hit a solid
drive down the center of the
fairway. Woosnam hit his next
shot into the crowd on the right
side of the fairway; Watson put
his second shot 10 feet from the
pin.

Watson made a par and an
eagle on the next two holes to
pull into a three—way tie with
Woosnam and Spain’s _lose—Maria

Olazabal at minus 11. It seemed
as though Watson would recover
from his disastrous effort at hole
No. 12 and break out of his four-
year streak without a tournament
win. Woosnam was not to be
denied, however, as both
Olazabal and Watson choked on
the last hole.

Olazabal seemed to take
command of the , tournament,
pulling in front of Woosnam by
one stroke. Fate reared its ugly
head, though, and the young
Olazabal, picked by many to win
this year’s event, was forced to
play bridesmaid. At the par 3 No.
16, he left his tee shot in the
bunker next to the green. He
saved par after a brilliant "sand
shot left him five feet from the
hole. -

Unfortunately for Olazabal, his
drive went home to Spain before

time 150 yards from the green.
His next shot found a green-side

After Olazabal faltered on the
last hole, the tournament was
between Woosnam and Watson
again. The pair entered the last

hole tied for the lead at 11 under 4.5,

past two years, this tournament
wouldbe decided in extra playoff
holes.

Watson and Woosnam both
shanked their drives. Watson’s

“We started off really slow;
nether of us were playing that
great, but we played smart,” said
Devins.

“We tried to take over the net
and put the ball away. Basically,
we wanted to keep our returns
low and rush the net.

“When we serve to get our first
serves in, we rush the net.
Basically, our goal was to rush
the net, be consistent, put the
ball away and don’t go for too
much,” added Devins.

The LoPrinzi—Devins victory
was followed by the third—seed
team of Chris Orir and Josie

beatLaura Barron and Marianne

Orir-Neiswenter took the first
set, but Barron—Nielsen came back

in the second. By the third set, .

Orir-Neiswenter proved to be
the better of the two teams.
The Lady Panthers’ only
doubles loss in the competition
came from the No. 2-seed team
of Jill Cohen and Barbara
McCarthy to Martha Witiosch and
Cathy Patricola 6-3 and 6-2.
“We need a little work on our
doubles,” said Cohen. “We’ve

 

improved a lot, but we didn't get
to play as many matches together
during our spring season as we
did in our fall. So we just need to
play more, but I think we showed
improvement.”

With the Pitt squad holding a 2-
1 lead over the Royals, both teams
headed into the second leg of the
competition, the singles matches.

The Lady Panthers took five of
the six singles matches of the
evening. The Pitt singles squad
opened the matches with No. 1-
seed LoPrinzi defeating Balcius

“I think [my match] went really 1

"I’m really excited that I won, I

probably one of my most

Staﬁ‘ Writer ’

During all of last season, relief O

pitcher Dennis Terzich appeared
in only seven games for the Pitt
baseball team as the Panthers
struggled to an 8-23 record. In
his limited playing time, Terzich
used a hard overhead fast ball to

 ‘ . post one save and a 6.05 ERA. '

One year later, after altering

' his throwing motion, Terzich has‘

become the Panthers’ most active
stopper — appearing in 15 of
Pitt's 31 games — and the
Panthers have improved to 1,2-

20 this year.

Terzich owes most of his and
the team’s improvement to first-
year head coach Mark Jackson.

“Coach Jackson dropped me
down to sidearm before the
season because he wanted to
take advantage of the movement
on my fast ball,” said Terzich.

“It was weird at first because I
have been throwing overhead
since Little League, but it has
been effective." ,

Terzich claims that this is a

'typical example of Jackson’s

coaching.
“His baseball has philosophy

behind it," said Terzich. “He
started us out with the basics _in
preseason and took it from there.
In a few years, he’ll have a real
successful program.”

Everything hasn’t been perfect
this season, however.

Due to his new throwing style,
Terzich has developed tendinitis
in his right elbow, and he also

' strained his right rotator cuff.

“I’m so used to throwing
overhead that my mechanics are
sometimes off,” said Terzich, a
redshirt sophomore from West
Mifﬂin. “And when that happens,-
I put too much stress on my arm.”

Congratulations to  

George C. Bandik

coordinator of the undergraduate chemistry
program and this year’s winner of the
American Chemical Society— Student
Affiliates’ OUTSTANDING SERVICE AWARD
for his contribution, service, and dedication to
chemistry undergraduates and
undergraduate chemistry programs.

rm: PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, April 15, 1991 I 

Terzich said another reason
for the injury might be overuse.

“There was a stretch earlier in
the year [when] I pitched ﬁve out
of five games,” said T erzich. “That
also takes its toll."

Terzich blames his arm
problems for his poor
performance — five runs given
up against Providence — last

_ Saturday. -

“I had no velocity on my fast
ball, and I had no movement.
Earlier in the season,.I had
velocity, movement, and I was
hitting my spots. I just didn't
have that against Providence,”
said T erzich.

IRelz'efpz'tcl9er T erziclo shows oz year com ma/ee oz dzﬂerence 

Through it all, however,
Jackson has remained confident
of Terzich’s ability.

“His confidence is still high,” '

said Terzich. “He still puts me in
there to do the job.”

Off the field, Terzich does the
job as well. Terzich made the
dean’s list last semester and has
made the Pitt Athletic Honor

Roll three times while majoring

in business/ﬁnance.

“The players on the team misﬁﬁ? V

a lot of classes -because of
baseball,” said T erzich. “But if

. we don’t hit the books, then

Coach Jackson hears about it.”

with Pitt freshman Steve Rau, the
Pirates continued to Outclass the
Panthers. Robert Sheppard
stroked a clean single and
advanced to second base On a
single by Mike Groppuso — the
1990 first—team Big East third
baseman.

With two on and only one Out,
John D’Addetta hit the second

‘-“three-run blast Of the inning,

giving Seton Hall a 7.—0 lead.
After retiring the final two
batters in the second, the heavens
opened up and the rain started to
flow. The tarp was quickly pulled
out, and the game remained in
limbo for over two hours.

When the game resumed, Seton

Hall continued to dominate. The
Pirates pounded Out nine more
runs Over the last ﬁve innings.
The hitting stars for the Pirates
were Ferretti‘ (3—fOr—S, 1 HR, 5
RBI) and Sheppard (4-for-S).

"3' Pitt got On the board in the

fourth when Greg Trimbur
walked and advanced on aJasOn
Roth single. T rimbur scored On a
sacrifice ﬂy by Bryan Henne, and
Roth scored On a sharp Greg
Christrnan single.

Pitt scored its only other run Of
the game in the bottom of the
fifth when senior Blain Vucci hit
a solo shot over the center-field
wall. ‘

“It was a big thrill for me,” said

._g»:~Vucci. “It’s always good to get a’
homer, no matter what the

outcome of the game is."
