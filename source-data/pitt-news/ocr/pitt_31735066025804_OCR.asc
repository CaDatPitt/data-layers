5 GB President says Union
not enough for students

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

The William Pitt Union may no longer be large enough "to
house all of Pitt’s student organizations..

Student Government Board President Gil Golden said, at
Monday’s Senate Council meeting in Forbes Quad, that students
and student organizations need more space.

There is not enough storage space in WPU for the groups, and
it costs approximately $850 for a 10—by-10'feet square space out-
side of the university. Students do not have access to the eighth
and ninth floors of the union because there are NASA and other
research offices that are not necessarily student related.

Over the summer, Telefact moved to the eighth floor, and
finally students claimed space on that ﬂoor, Golden said.

“Students could use that space. I’m not suggesting something

‘ is wrong here, but student groups are growing, and we could
really use some additional space,” he said.

Golden said it does not make sense to have those offices in a
student union when there are not enough cubicles for student
organizations on the fifth floor and conference rooms. He said
that there is a waiting list for cubicles.

“It’s definitely something I would like to pursue. It's definitely
something worth looking into,” Golden said.

Golden also inquired into the definite date for graduation.
‘Graduation will be held Friday May 1 at the Civic Arena.

“I think that was the best possible solution,” Golden said. “I ~

Sexual assaults and rapes of
Pitt students are being report-
ed more frequently, according
to Assistant Director of Public
Safety Gary Moses.

Four female students have
reported sexual assaults or
rapes to the police this semes-
ter, as compared to one for
the entire year of 1991.

With a new Student Govjef/nment Board
elected students might think the old board
is finished. ' ,

President Gil Golden said to think again.

“This board has not yet done all that we
have to do,” Golden said at last week’s SGB
meeting. “We’re not lame ducks, despite
popular opinion. We still have at least six
weeks to go.”

Pitt’s Board‘ of.Trustees is currently
reviewing a new shuttle system for the uni-
versity, Golden reported, which the current
SGB played a major role in bringing about.
If approved, the plan will add $30 per
semester to student tuition for expanded
shuttle service.

“Plans are underway to start the system 
which seems to go pretty far above and
beyond the recommendations from the
'chancellor’s Task Force on safety, which. he
convened last summer,” Golden said.

  Current SGB still has goals, plans

“Things are going to be done to possibly
have a transportation system that’s a thou-
sand times better than what we have now,
starting January fourth,” he added.

The Freshman Council reported at the
meeting that it will be promoting the new
transportation system next semester, pend-
ing trustees approval. The council will be
distributing sever_al.thousand maps of the
new system.

The current SGB is also looking into plans
to work closely with Carnegie Mellon,
Carlow College, Port Authority Transit and
federal agencies to plan a more expansive
shuttle system, Golden said.

A shufﬂing of administration may also
play a role in bettering Pitt’s transportation
service, Golden explained.

“The Parking and Transportation Office
has now been split,” Golden said. “They are
two separate entities, so that they can truly
concentrate and be funded for those things
that each are required for transportation.”

Liberate your old jeans
on Levi’s Amnesty Day

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Have you been looking for
an excuse to_ get rid of those
old Jordache or Sergio
Valente jeans that somebody
bought you eons ago?

All Pitt students who are
trying to get rid of those
old jeans and also want
to help clothe the less fortu-
nate people in the area now
have the opportunity to do
so.

On Tuesday Nov. 10, the
Pitt Program Council and Levi
Strauss and Co. are sponsor-
ing a Levi’s 501 Amnesty Day.
The event will be held on the
patio outside William Pitt
Union.

According to Todd Cable,

director of Special Events for
PPC, the Levi’s 501 Amnesty
Day is a great chance for Pitt
students to help local needy
people and get rid of some
real ugly jeans.

“It’s a good way to get rid

of those old Sergio Va1ente’s
that are hiding in your closet,
and others benefit from it so
it’s a really good idea,” he
said.

According to Cable, partici-
pants will include Pitt stu-
dents, faculty and community
members, and as an added
incentive, students who come
down to donate their non-
Levi’s jeans also win a free
T-shirt and are automatically
entered into a drawing to
win a free pair of Levi’s 501
jeans.

Some students have found the perfect major... maybe

By Apryl Flynn

For the Pitt News

Switching-majors can result in
an extended college stay and
be "very costly, but it may be
the only option for a student to

' be_happy in the future.

Angie Busbee, a career coun-
seling intem for the Counseling
and Student Development
Center, said the most common
reason students find themselves

in this situation is because they

did not take time to do proper
career planning and develop-
ment early in their college
career. _

Busbee said that many.stu-
dents make an initial" first
choice influenced by outside
forces, such as peers, parents
and the media. “And then at
some point, they realize that
they never took the time to find
out themselves what they really
wanted to do,” Busbee said.

This is when many students

come into the office and say‘

that they are in a major that
someone told them was a

“good” major or one that they
can make them a lot of money,
Busbee ‘said. But now they real-
ize that maybe making a lot of
money is not really what they
value most. What they value
most is doing something mean-
ingful to them, she said.

‘.‘It would be more beneficial
to change your major and get
into an area that you truly want
to be in than it would just to
get a degree and get" out of
school in four years,” she said.
“It would be better to stay in
school an extra semester or
year than to suffer long term.”

Fred Koloc, director of acade-
mic advising for CAS, said that
switching from CAS to a profes-
sional program, can be a prob-
lem because professional pro-
grams are so structured.
However, switching majors
within CAS “is much more ﬂexi-
ble than most students “realize,”
he said, since the "requirements
for a major are only 30 credits
on the average.

“It used to be very easy for
students to at least switch from

7

one major‘, to no major, to liber-
al studies,” Koloc said. “But a
year and a half ago, the" rules
were changed. Now a liberal
studies student. has to have a
proposal accepted before their
senior year. Therefore, that
change is certainly much more
difficult than it used to be.”

He stressed that students
should remember that majoring
in something they are interested
in and do ‘well in does not
require them to find a job in
that one area. They can bend
their major to other kinds of
jobs and careers.

“Most students do not realize
that so much of the work in the
world is not really relevant to
the specific topic that the stu-
dent studies, it is much more
relevant to their abilities to
learn and understand,” he said;

4 Busbee said that 80 percent
of people working in career
ﬁelds are not working in a field
‘related to their major. She also
said that most people do not
realize that there are 30,000
careers. “It makes you realize

how much research you have
to do to find the right careers
for you.”

Busbee suggested that stu-
dents start planning in their first
year to find outwhat they like
and do not like, and what their
skills, abilities and values are.

The Counseling and Student
Development Center offers
group and individual counsel-
ing. In these sessions, a career
development model is worked
through. The four steps of this
model are confusion, self-
awareness, career awareness
and an eventual move toward

helping the student decide on a.
.major.

Koloc recommends students
take the introductorycourses to
see how theyreact to the mate-
rial and to see whether the
major deals with issues they are
interested in.

He said that although declar-
ing a major is different in each
department, most departments
like to see students declaring
their majors at the end of their
sophomore years.

For The Pitt News

A study is being conducted at
Pitt to examine ways of pre-
venting and controlling pollu-
tion on campus.

ties around the country are tak-
ing part in similar studies, fund-
ed by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency. V

/« The EPA has allocated
$100,000 for a study at Pitt
because “the EPA wanted to
see how a contained communi-
ty like a university would man-
age their waste and respond to
opportunities for pollution pre-
vention,” said Angel Martin-
Dias, a projects manager at the
Center for Hazardous Materials
Research in Harmarville.

Other colleges and universi-

The center is working jointly
on the study with Pitt to look at
non-academic facets of the uni-
versity, such as how supplies
are purchased and what kinds
of supplies are ordered in every
department, as well as universi-
ty printing, housing and food
services, Martin-Dias said.

The concern with pollution
and waste is also increasingly
apparent in the industry.

“Chemical companies are
becoming more and more envi-
ronmentally concerned,” said
Laurence Keller, the director of

the Department of
Environmental Health and
Safety at Pitt-

Keller ‘said that_ companies
are less willing to have their
products associated with the
stigma of environmental disre-

gard.

“The goal of the study is to
look at areas where pollution or
waste is generated and to look
at ways of recycling and pre-
venting this waste,” Keller said

One area they’ll'look at is
Pitt’s use of chemicals in labora-
tories. .

“[We will look at] Chemicals_
which would be persistent and
get into the ground water,”
Keller said.

The study focuses on reactive
organics like picric acid and
heavy metals, such as chrome,
cadmium, lead and mercury,
Keller said. The study’s goal is
to eliminate the university’s
need to dispose of this type of
waste and be responsible for
the, costs involved in transport-

ing these materials through the-

“waste stream,” Keller said.

One way to cut back on haz-
ardous waste production would
be the widespread use of “elec-
tronic warehouses” within uni-
versities, Keller said. He said
they would facilitate the re-
using and recycling of chemi-
cals and other materials. A pilot
program is currently in place in
the chemistry department.

It works like this: A person
logs into a computer and com-
pletes a purchase request. If the
computer finds someone who
has the requested compound,
regardless of the department,
the computer electronically
introduces the two parties and
an_- exchange is made.

Two years ago, $1.2 million
was spent on hazardous waste
disposal at Pitt and “probably

EPA allocates funds to Pitt for pollution prevention study

less than half a million dollars
was spent last year,” Keller said.

He credits the decrease in
hazardous waste disposal to
recent policy changes that sup-
port a “total management con-
cept” of waste prevention.
“We’re changing the way we
handle these materials,” Keller
said.

Martin-Dias said that the
results from the study at Pitt
have more than one purpose.

“While we’re looking for
opportunitiesto reduce waste
and implement new ideas and
then stand back to watch the
results, we also hope that stu-
dents and faculty become

aware of what pollution pre- '

vention is about and incorpo-
rate it into their own lives,”
:Martin-Dias said.

Pitt’s Students for Media and
Art Exhibition presented its sec-
ond student—made film and
video festival last night.

“The SMAE allows students to
use the equipment to help
them m_ake films,” - SMAE
President Brian Wittle said.
“But otherwise the students are-
leftto themselves to create.”

A sparsevbut enthusiastic
crowd of 20 attended the
event, which was held in the
Assembly Room ofthe William
Pitt Union.

“We haven’t been able to
advertise as well as last year,”
tWittle said explaining the small
crowd. Last year’s attendance
was near 100, and 10 films_.
were shown.

Four films were shown this
year, ranging from four to 20
minutes in length.

Kevin Ruppenthal’s Tortured
Soul led off the show, examin-

‘ing the revenge-driven fantasy

of —a wheel-chair bound
woman.

Brian Wittle’s contribution, a
20—minute—long parody of a
family in crisis, called SC/91?1l£tZ
Family Christmas brought guf-
faws, as did Hugues Dalton’s
silent Biff the Vacuum Cleaner,
His Wife-and Her Lover. C
' Dalton also presented the
dialogue-less Tragedy of George
Fenzi. ‘

SMAE will also be presenting
its second annual art show next
term, featuring student—made
paintings, photography and
sculpture, as well as another
film festival in March.

Also, the public safety fee and the $1 fee
that are to be added to students’ tuitions
were concerns of Golden.

Vice Chancellor of Business and Finance
Ben Tuchi said that it looks like the adminis-
tration will move ahead in implementing the
new transportation system in early January if
it is passed by the Board of Trustees.

“A large amount [of events] need to occur
before the fee is put into place,” Tuchi said.
He said that it will probably be enacted in
the summer or fall terms, because people
are not aware of the changes, and it would
be hard to change the billingsystem.

Golden said that students have added to
the chancellor’s Safety Task Force and have
made remarkable accomplishments. “I hope
it passes,” he said.

Other issues addressedat the meeting:

0 A committee has been set up to review
the Study Abroad proposal.

0 SGB member Jacob Brody said that he
thinks the student body should“ be able to

participate in Governor‘ Bob Casey’s
Operation Jump Start so they have a say in
what goes into the mulitpurpose academic
Complex. E

T uchi said that at this time t_here is nothing
going on with the buildings, except Provost
Donald Henderson is preparing to appoint a
building committee that will include stu-
dents. - - __

The state is in the process of preparing to
advertise for architectural and engineering
contractors for the structure. Tuchi’s rough

_ guess of when the spade will hit the ground

is early 1994, but other projects that do not
require excavation will be started much
sooner than that date. ‘

0 A _resolution urging Provost Henderson
to appoint a search committee for the posi-
tion of director of the University Library
System passed. ’

0 The council voted to support the idea of
in-house university spousal benefits for

domestic partnerships. The Staff Association 1

Board member Derrick St.
Clair said that he is working
with police to map out safe
walking routes in North and
South Oakland by the end of
this week. These routes will
include emergency phones,
signs, more lighting and
added patrol, he said, with
additional patrol being added
immediately.

St. Clair also reported that
recycling bins. will be placed
around the fraternity houses in
an attempt to improve Pitt’s
recycling habits.

“Fraternities need to recy-
cle,” St. Clair said. “It’s one of
[Pitt’s] biggest recycling prob-
lems. This is the first step
toward bettering the recycling
programs on our campus.”

Recycling bins will be
placed for the fraternity hous-
es on the hill, around
Sutherland Hall and the North
Oakland fraternity houses, St.
Clair reported.

The Resident Student
Association added that recy-

_ cling will also spread through-

out the residence halls. RSA
was recently granted money to
put thebins in the halls.
Matthew Sipple, an SGB
representative on the Senate
Committee, said that the com-
mittee was working on clear-
ing up the process people go
through if they’ve been
harassed or if they have been
accused of harassment.

“A lot of people — faculty
— are very concerned about

being accused of harassment,” _

Sipple said. “We're going to
see what procedures are need-
ed and makesure that they’re
followed.”

Golden reminded Pitt stu-
dents of the free legal coun-
seling available weekly for
any kind of legal problem or

' landlord complaint.

“Anybody who needs free
legal counseling; all you have
to dois call and make an
appointment,” Golden said.

He also encouraged student
leaders to consider attending a
leadership seminar, which will
be sponsored by Duquesne
University. The seminar, on
Nov. 14, costs $8.iGolden said
SGB will sponsor any student
leaders interested.

Bike parking is expanding, -

board member Dan Leichter
said. Additi.onal bike racks
should be installed soon near
the Cathedral of Learning and
Schenley Quad, he reported.
The board-elect was con-
gratulated and encouraged to
work at fulfilling his campaign
platforms in the year ahead.
The student body was

reminded that students should

not stop giving their input to
SGB.

“I urge all students,”
Leichter said. “Just because
the election is over doesn’t
mean you can’t get involved
in student government.”

. X-Ploited

Imagine walking to the supermarket in the morning

because you ran out of your favorite cereal — Ben __

Franklin Proverbios. You ask where you can find them,
and the stockperson kindly points you to the historical
figure aisle. Along the aisle you see it all; there-is a
plethora of historical_-figure products: Harriet Beecher
Stowe’s bookends, Ghandi bedwear and Kennedy’s
Soothing Ointment. If the truth be told, it's a disgusting
display of poor taste if there ever was one. .
Fortunately, commercial marketing has yet to come to
that. However, given the way that things seem to -__be
going, even the greatest minds of history are not

beyond the scope of a quick way to make a buck.‘

Entertainment figures ‘have been marketed and exploit-

ed by big business for years now, but after all, that is‘ 

what the entertainment industry "is all about. Those in
the industry,,for the most part, desire that type of
lifestyle. .

But now, withﬁthe hype of Spike Lee’s film about
Malcolm X, marketing masters have targeted the
deceased black leader, a major historical figure, as the
newest fad. The “X” T-shirts and baseball caps have
been around for a while and are not the focus of this
article. However,_ a new wave of products. are arriving,

\ apparently including some “X” potato chips.

The exploitation‘ of Malcolm X to sell worthless
objects is as_offensive aswhen the great advertising
"minds of America used the Gulf War to sell products,
like CNN’s Gulf War highlight film. Visions of American

ﬂags ﬂoating in a warm summer breeze as the backdrop

for such slogans as “The Heartbeat of America” is not

only cheap exploitation but an insult to the men and

women who risked their lives in the Arabian Desert.

Last week, Dr. Maulana Karenga expressed his con— '
cern that Spike Lee is degrading himself by using.

Malcolm X to makemoney because Hollywood has
made Malcolm X into a commodity instead of a “world
historical being.” . .

We do not condemn Spike Lee, whose movie should
be an interesting look into the man’s life, but we do
condemn the shameless capitalistic vultures that are
using the interest surrounding the movie to make a
quick buck. Most of them probably care littleor nothing
about the man or his place in history. -

Perhaps somepeople would say that “X” products are
not all bad because they keep the name of "a leader’ in
the public eye. However, these kinds of products deval-
ue the man’s message. Value is not simply a question of
supply and- demand, it, is also a question of scarcity.
Great leaders are scarce, and Malcolm X was a -great
leader. By making such goods as “X” potato chips, “X”
mugs, etc., we are taking somebodywho meant so
much to so many people and turning his ideals into an
invaluable trivial good that can be bought and sold.

Looking back on this year’s
election fervor, I can’t help
but notice that in the “year of
the woman,” women didn’t
fare so well. The women that
did, well, I congratulate them
on their persistence, but I
have to question their intent. I
am reminded of that quippy

statement made sometime dur-

ing the campaign: “We need
to elect more breasts; we’ve
certainly been electing boobs
long enough.” .

Well, a couple seats are now
occupied by people with the
aforementioned appendages.
Unfortunately, these breasts
are attached to boobs.

As I perceive it, these bleed-
ing hearts can’t really repre-
sent a majority opinion, can
they? I am speaking specifi-
cally of Barbara Boxer, Diane
Fienstien and, yes, our own
Lynn Yeakel. These three
would make a fine representa-

tion of. the population,
wouldn’t they? Forgive me if I
laugh. -

We can almost write off
Boxer and Fienstien as a nec-
essary evil. (Whaddaya want,
folks? .We’re talking about
California here.) But Lynn
Yeakel? What the hell
were we thinking? I find it ve-
ry disturbing that this woman
carried almost half of our
great state. You should, too.

Not that Arlen Specter is any

sort of great guy. On the con-
trary -— he’s a liar, a sneak, an
all-around politician. But Lynn
Yeakel? Oh, my. .What’s the
world coming to?

‘If you didn’t already know,
Lynn Yeakel is little more than

_a rich (very rich) angry
woman. ' .
Regardless of what feminists
may claim, Yeakel entered the
campaig-n for the sole reason
that she was angry at Arlen
Specter for his treatment of
Anita Hill during the Clarence
Thomas hearings. V
Incidentally, Specter was
only doing his job, but that’s a
"story in itself. She tried to
infiltrate the “boys’ club” and
failed. For that matter, why is
the Senate a “boys’ club?”
Keep in mind,- my fellow
citizen and voter, we elected

' them all — not male voters,

Chris

  Diersen

but all voters. If the voters
wanted women in these vari-
ous government positions,
they’d be there. '

I did feel sorry for Yeakel,

though, after , watching “her —

concession speech on election
night. The gang of loud-
mouthed idiots shouting
before and during her speech
made me realize just who

stands behind this movement. ~

Teary-eyed bleeding hearts
abounded, and the spectacle
was entertaining, if not embar-
rassing. _ _

There was talk of the next
election, when Yeakel would
pull through and bump
Specter from his seat on the
Senate. I’ve got news for you,
Lynn, and it ain’t good
news. You can throw in the
towel. The game is over, and
you’ve lost. You failed to

Congressional booby prize Winners ‘

instill anger in the hearts of
Pennsylvan-ians, and even

dirty old Arlen Specter shin—ed I

over the darkness of your
campaign.

If women want to get into
politics, they are going to
have to take a new approach.
For years, liberal women have
portrayed themselves as repre-
sentatives of the oppressed
women of America. A

This tactic is stale, and ‘peo— A

ple are sick ‘of hearing
it (excepting Californians, who
have always been confused).
Women are going to have to
bite the bullet like everyone
else. and try to work with the
powers that be insteadof
fighting the government and
calling names. .

,Women need to look among
their ranks in history and find-
their successful counterparts.
Take, for example, Margaret
Thatcher —
influential individual and a
great asset to the‘ Brits.

Look closer to home and
you’ll find such individuals as
Elizabeth Dole, successful in
her own right, not as a

woman but as an individual in ‘

the political spectrum. _

I’m not saying that women
must cave in all their ideals
to make voters happy,
just that if they continue to
wage war on the govern-
ment, they will continue to
lose.

Just thought I’d let you
know.

By Mike Johns

The Pitt News

He was one of the most exciting bas-
ketball players ever to play at the
University of Pittsburgh —- an offensive
innovator, a creator with an unbelievable
repertoire of spin moves, double—clutch—
es and dazzling ﬁnishes.

As part of a'star—studded but star-
crossed cast that always pushed things to
the absolute limits, no player personiﬁed
the Panthers’ style more than the
Freakazoid — hitting the hanging
jumper, leaning in for a crazy scoop
shot, throwing down a dunk with
authority and always igniting the crowd.

An integral part of perhaps the most
talented Panther squad in school history,
it was Demetreus Gore who could light
up the crowd likeno other.

Gore came to Pitt as one of the top
high school basketball players in the
land. Hailing from Detroit’s Chadsey
High School, Michigan’s 1984 Mr.
Basketball made an immediate impact on
the Panther program, quickly becoming
a fan favorite with his breathtaking. cre-
ativity and dramatic ﬂair. He, along with
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane and Curtis
Aiken, elevated Pitt’s program from rela-
tive obscurity to national prominence.

Gore truly blossomed in his sopho-
more season, tapping a great deal of his

unlimited resources to lead Pitt with 16.1
points per game on a sizzling 56 percent
f1eld—goal percentage. He also led Pitt in
free—throw shooting, nailing 84 percent,
and chipped in 3.8 rebounds. This stellar
season earned Gore All—Big East second
team honors. ’

Southwest Missouri State in the National
Invitational Tournament. This led to the
firing of head coach Roy Chipman. Paul
Evans replaced him, and Gore initially
had problems adjusting to the new sys-
tem.

His junior season was highlighted by a
30-point explosion against Wisconsin in
the Rainbow Classic, but inconsistency
plagued Gore. His scoring dropped off
to 12.9 points and 45 percent shooting
from the ﬂoor, although he displayed a
better passing game, dishing out 107
assists.

Pitt’s massive team talent finally

The 1987-88 season was Gore’s cur-
tain call. Unfortunately, he suffered an
extremely severe ankle sprain during a
preseason pickup game that hampered
himfor 'a great deal of the season. Pitt
opened the season ranked second in the
nation and fired out to nine wins before
being upset at Georgetown. After a slug-
gish start, Gore exploded in Big East
play, helping Pitt win its first-ever out-
right regular season championship.

Gore finished with 1,565 career points
but fell short of his Final Four dream.
With such a potent collection of talent
(four high school—All Americans), Gore
and his mates appeared destined to

but hard luck found Pitt every March.
Now, five years later, Gore looks back at
his career — the ups and downs and
that fateful NCAA Tournament loss to
Vanderbilt that ended the career of the
man they called Freakazoid.

Pitt News: Why do you think you’re not
playing pro basketball?

Gore: My biggest reason was I didn’t
have a good senior year that was up to
my standards, due to a preseason injury.
So that set me back right away, and
looking back I should have redshirted
and come back my senior year. But at
the time I. didn’t feel like I wanted to go
through another year of college basket-
ball.

It is just not like going to the games
and playing; there is'a lot of other stuff
— traveling, coaches on your back all
the time and peoples’ expectations of
you. I was just burned out by big—time
college basketball, so I didn’t want to
redshirt and come back for another year.
PN: Did the fact that Charles Smith was a
senior and you were ranked in the top
ﬁve or top 10 have anything to do with
your not wanting to redshirt?

Gore: Yes. I thought we_ would at least

didn’t work out, and Jerome (Lane) went

Woodstra said of Pitt’s
relatively unknown setter,
who has led the offense
to two: straight Big East
titles.

Mernagh has quietly
assist-ed Ann M.arie

side hitter, for the past
two seasons and helped
the All-American hopeful

to another great year.

Lucanie has been
Lucanie — and that has
been just fine for Pitt.

She leads the team in _

kills and digs and is look-
ing to become the Big
East Player of The Year
for the second straight
year. She might also
become the conference
tournament’s Outstanding
Player for a record third
time.

With the improvement
of ‘the first-year players

on both offense and‘

defense and the rock-
solid play‘ of both
Mernagh and Lucanie,
Woodstra does have
something to smile about.
Her team has come from
the doldrums of the Big

East cellar to the top rank

in the conference.
“We’re starting to do

some things that are
good,” Woodstra said
with a smile. “We are

playing much better
defense and have much
more balanced attack.”

Continued from page 7

_ work.

This part of the system saved
Pitt and forced a third action to
try to break the tie. This step
was to find ‘out the percentage
of points won by both Pitt and
Providence. It turned out
through‘ some nifty calculations
that Pitt had won 58 percent of
its points while the Friars only
won 52 percent of theirs.

So the long and drawn-out
process of selecting the No. 1

_seed in the Big East tournament

was over. Pitt won — barely.

The rest of the seeds were as
follows: No. 2 Providence, No.
3 Seton Hall, No. 4
Georgetown, No. 5 Syracuse,
No. 6 Villanova, No. 7
Connecticut and No. 8 Boston
College.

The Big East Tournament will
be hosted by the top-seeded
Panthers on Saturday and
Sunday Nov. 21 and 22 at the
Fitzgerald Field House. The
tournament will start early
Saturday.

Opening up at 9 a.m. will be
Seton Hall versus Villanova in

match one.

At the same time, in match
two, Providence will face
Connecticut. At 11:30 a.m.
match three ‘will pit the
Panthers against
College. Also at 11:30 a.m. will
be match four, in which
Georgetown squares off with
Syracuse." I

The semi-final matches will
also be held on Saturday, one
at 5:30 p.m. and the other at 8
p.m. The championship match

will take place on Sunday at 2

p.m. *

with an assist going to Koval.
Pitt then opened up" its lead
with two goals just nine sec-
onds apart early in the second
period. 1 ’
Stock scored at 3:18 (Koval,
Crousey) to make it 2-0, and
Mark Zukowski added a goal
off the setup from Scott
Kalson at 3:27 to give Pitt a 3-

0 advantage,

After a goal by Kalson at
7:18 (Koval, Giordano) which
gave Pitt a four goal lead, Matt
White closed out the second
period scoring with a goal at
12: 17 (Crousey, Kalson).

Pitt’s final "two goals came
early in the third period.
White tallied his second of the
game at 1:17 (Giordano,
Crousey), and Stock finalized

the Pitt victory with a score at
3:27 (Zukowski). The win
gives the Panthers a 2-3 ‘Over-
all record, 2-2 in league ‘play.

Pitt’s next game is an 8:30
p.m. start this Saturday against
the Pittsburgh Junior Stars at
Harmarville. F

From there they head to the
Civic Arena to face the
Duquesne Ice Dukes at 4:30
p.m. on Nov. 22.

PN: ‘What position did you play
here at Pitt?

Gore: I started out as a guard
and when the new coach came
in (Paul Evans) I moved to for-
ward mostly because of the new‘
personnel that was here, or
whatever the reason was. '

PN: If you had stayed at guard

would you have had a better
chance at playing in the NBA?

Gore: I know‘I would have, but

you know at the time they
wanted to move Rod (Brookin)

to the two guard spot for what-

ever reason. And what hap-
pened is that Jason Matthews
came in and played the two, so

'0 I had to play the three.

PN: In your senior year, the
team potentially could have had
all that talent plus Brookin,
Brian Shorter
Goodson.‘
Gore: Exactly —— it would have
been .a‘ great line up.

THE Prrr NEWS, Tuesday, November 10, 1992.

Gore

NBA scouts? A .
Gore: Well, I know he didn’t
promote-me. I know that for a
fact. I guess it could have been
for personal differences, but I
never knew why. As far as I
know, he didn’t promote any-
body, so I didn’t feel slighted. I
really don’t know about Smith
or Lane. As far as I know he
never went out of his way to
promote somebody. I guess that
is up to individual coaches as to
whether they want to promote
people, and obviously he didn’t.
PN: A lot of people say that he
made a major effort to promote
Darren Momingstar.

Gore: That is what I hear. But I
wasn’t around. But I figured

somebody had to do something. '

Darren is a good player for
what he does. He has some
skills, he has good post moves.
He is not a complete stiff. As far
as I was concerned he had to
get some type of promotion —
somebody had to say something
good about him. A

PN: Do you think it is fair that a
coach uses his athletes to keep
his job, and when their eligibili-
ty is up he doesn’t help to pro-
mote them to get a shot at the
next level?

Gore: Well, "I tell you that has
been going on forever, and that
is not going to change —- even
though that goes on a little
more here at‘Pitt. But it goes on
everywhere. Athletes who play
football, basketball or whatever
will tell you that after it’s done,
most universities won’t help
you. You’re- not making money
for them anymore, so you’re on

, your own. Some schools, like

Georgetown, with (John)
Thmnpson  he tries to take a

‘personal interest to his players

and that kind of helps.

' PN: Do you regret coming‘ to

Pitt?

Gore: Not at all. It didn’t turn
out how I wanted, but I made
some very good friends —

‘.Cur_tis (Aiken), Jerome (Lane),
John Blanton, Charles (Smith)

—- it is not something I regret;
Some regrets are from maybe
after my junior year or before
my junior year. After the coach-

ing changel took a long look at
transferring to Michigan State. I
was real close to doing it.
Before Evans even came in I
was given reports that he was
going to bench me, and there
was going to be changes
because personalities wouldn’t
mesh. But I tried to give him the
beneﬁt of the doubt. It ended
up happening just like people
said.
PN: A lot of people said that

_even though you had a lot of

talent," your previous coach, Roy

 

 

PN: When you got into the Big
East Tournament and the NCAA
Tournament, what kind of ten-
sion was there?

Gore: It was fine in the regular
season, but in the tournaments,
even with Chipman, when the
coaches get tight that translates

into a lot of unnecessary‘

screaming‘ and yelling, and that
atmosphere in ‘February — the
guys just want to get the season
over with. A

When the NCAA Tournament
started the guys would say for-

needed it to a certain extent. It
helped him out.

With Charles Smith you don’t
need to be like that. What are
you going to gain by cussing
him out? As far as calling him a

motivator, it depends on what . -

you would call a motivator.

PN: What is your opinion of
Coach Evans?

Gore:.I have no opinion on
Coach Evans. None. Right now I
have no animosity toward him
because now he’s just Paul to
me.

 
    

   

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Demetrius Gore was critica1_of Paul Evans’ handling Pitt shooting guard Ahmad Shareef.

Chipman, couldn’t take you to j

the Final Four.

Gore: It had nothing to do with
Chipman or Evans. ‘If Chipman
would have stayed our junior or
senior year  you could have
put any coach here who is
capable of coaching at any level
and we would have won 25 or
26 games. It is not one) certain
thing that Evans did. He just.
stepped into a team that was
Top 10 caliber. It was nothing
that he built.

get the differences with the
coaches, let’s just go out and
' win. :
PN: How would you rate Paul
Evans as a coach?
Gore: I wouldn’t.
PN: Is Evans a good motivator?
Gore: As far as a motivator, if
calling somebody an a—hole
500 times is motivation, then he
_is a great motivator. You can
take it two ways; some guys
need to be yelled at, I just want-
ed to play. Jerome, I think,

PN: How disappointed were
you after the Vanderbilt game?
Gore: I was -real disappointed.
The thing I was disappointed
about was we were going to
play in the Silverdome next  I
never got to play in there, and
that’s where I’m from.

It didn’t seem real. First of all,
I don’t'believe we played the
defenselwe played. The media
said Darrell Porter was sup-
posed to foul the guy, but I
know it didn’t happen. I never

heard any speciﬁc direction on
the bench, I was out of the
game. If anything, why would
he (Evans) take me out anyway?
I was a senior and he put in
Darrell, who was a freshman.

I will go on record as saying I

never heard anyone giving '

directions to foul anyone. We
should have had more pressure.
We played a zone, they rolled
the ball into half court and the
only thing that can beat us is a
three—pointer. We definitely
should have had more pressure.
PN: Ifyou had beat Vanderbilt,
you would have had a smooth
road to play Purdue in the Final
Eight.’

Gore: That was the most disap—_‘

pointing part of that loss. They
tried to blame the game on a

freshman. The coach should’

have stood up and said ‘we as a
team should have won.’

PN: Does Evans get his point’

across. to the team?

Gore: It gets to the point with
me personally, and a couple of
other guys that I know -— you
tune him out. You don’t want to
hear that day-in and day—out. It
gets to the point that you have
to focus on tuning the coach
out and playing basketball at
the same time. That is two
things to wony about when all
you should be worrying about
is playing basketball.

'I’m not saying you have to
baby guys. Everyone knows we
were an_ undisciplined team and
he did bring in discipline. But I
personally feel that he took it to
the extreme.

PN: What are you doing now?’  ‘

Gore: Right now I have an auto
body and customizing shop on
Frankstown —— 6564 Frankstown
Avenue. We do ground effects,
auto body work, the whole
thing. Anything you need we
can do it.

PN: Are you still a Pitt basket-
ball fan?

Gore: Oh yes. It can see some
of the same things happening to
them. Ahmad [Shareef] is a
much better player than he has
been showing. He really can’t
take the vocal abuse that Evans
gives.
