._  Encouraging‘ aswas the Panther‘ baseball turnout and
ashopeful as wasthe _outlook for a. “healthy" spring inter_-
collegiate sports program, it appears now that whatever op-
timism the Pitt‘ fans held ‘fora “norma ” spring sportscard
is duefor a sudden setback. With the recent announcement

continued‘ after" June 30, the problem. of scraping up enough

is no smallmatter. ‘ , - . _

-been the ones tokeep intercollegiate ‘sports alive. With these

heayyfacademic schedules, must either show good marks or

to expect these future “admirals” to give up whatlittle. free
time they have ﬁghting their hearts out for an Alma Mater

. fbably never intend to return. ’ ' ,1

former Pitt men will answer to
their names. Most ofthem learned
their football under Jock Suther-

the Panther meant that there was
"quite a bite behind it, -not a tooth-
less chirp. .It’ will bring back a day
when ‘the names of Shotwell, 0l‘lYl—
