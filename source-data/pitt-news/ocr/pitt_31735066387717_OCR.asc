Ex—Soviet

Staff Writer

Yuli Edelshtein, a Russian
Jew formerly imprisoned in a
Soviet gulag labor camp, will
be speaking in room 501 of
the Cathedral of Learning to-
day at 3:30 p.m.

”Edelshtein, age 29, is form-
erly of Moscow and was an
English teacher who was per-
secuted for teaching Hebrew,
which is not condoned in the
Soviet Union in any form,”,
said Lew Borman, director of
community relations for the
United Jewish Federation.

Edelshtein was arrested in
1984 for drug possession and
sentenced to three years in a
gulag. ,

According to Borman,‘ the
KGB falsified the grounds for
his arrest because of— his
Hebrew teaching activities.

”He was released from con-
finement in May of 1987, ap-
parently partially because of

to talk on Soviet life

ton D.C. this coming Sunday.

refusnik

Gorbachev’s glasnost policies
and also because of consider-
able international pressure,”
said Borman. ”He applied to
emigrate to Israel repeatedly
prior to his arrest, but the real
reason for his arrest was his
Hebrew teachings. After his
release, Edelshtein succeeded
in emigrating to Israel,’’ said
Borman.

Edelshtein will be one of
four main speakers at the rally
for Russian Jews in Washing-

According to Borman, ”If
we can't trust the Soviets to
honor the Helsinki Accords,
then how can we trust them to
honor any agreement on
nuclear disarmament. or .hu.-
man rights?”

Borman also stated that all
seats scheduled on’ the free
"buses to the Washington rally
are now filled, but interested .
people should contact Rabbi
Joseph Levine at 648-7843.

Love is topic of talk

By Rich Cholodofsky

Staff Writer

Pitt's French and Italian depart-
ments will host a free lecture by
Professor B.F.'Bart, entitled ”The
Meaning of Romantic Love:
Flaubert’s Madame Bovary” at 3
p.m. Friday, Dec. 4, "in room
1228 of the Cathedral of
Learning. '

Bart, who is a professor in the
French department, is a" Flaubert
specialist. »

”After 40 years of publishing,
I have written three books, one,
oddly enough, called Flaubert-
Life and Times,” he said.

The lecture will look at the
meaning of romantic love by ex-
amining Flaubert’s Madame
Bovary. _

According to Bart, there are
two kinds of interpretations of the
meaning of romanticlove: post-

‘modernist and traditionalist.

”Postmodernists say it is very
hard to convey the meaning,” he

said. ”Tradiona|ists say that it is

possible. Flaubert proves both.

“I am a traditionalist,” he
added.

Bart said that he will try to
prove the traditionalist side in his
lecture. _

”When I am halfway through
the lecture, I will have thorough-
ly proven my opponents’ side,
but hopefully, when I am
through, I will have proven my
side,” he said.

Bart will lecture in English, but
all quotations will be in French.
”The French department wanted
the quotes in French,” he said. ’’If
you cannot understand spoken
French, this is not a lecture to
come to because the quotes are
the evidence for what I am trying
to prove.”

PAA to elect officers

The Pan African Association,
recently formed and registered at
Pitt last March, will hold a meet-
ing on Saturday, Dec. 5, to elect
new officials.

According to Ndembwela H.
N gunangwa, president of the or-
ganization, official positions are
open to everyone.

”We are open to all students of
African descent and all students
who believe in our cause,” said

Ngunangwa.

Ngunangwa said that the ob-
jectives of the organization in-
clude promotion of African
culture in the community,
healthy relations among African
students and staff, creation of an

‘assistance program and future

conferences and lectures "discuss-
ing the economic, political and
social development of Africa and
‘black culture.

Falwell libel case challenges
First Amendment protection

By Richard Carelli

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —— The Rev.
Jerry Falwell and magazine pub-
lisher Larry Flynt sat silently
across from one another in a
crowded courtroom as the
Supreme Court heard lively argu-
ments in a key free-press con-
troversy the two men sparked.

At issue is the constitutional
‘protections to be given satireand
parody, and the case is being
watchedgclosely by many in the
news business, especially politi-
cal cartoonists and commen-
tators. '

The justices, whose ruling is
expected byJu|y, must decide the
validity of a $200,000 award
won by Falwell for an advertising
parody that appeared in Flynt’s
magazine, Hustler.

The ad purports to quote Fal-
well discussing a sexual encoun-
ter with his mother in a Virginia
outhouse. '

”HustIer has every right to say
that man [Falwell] is full of b.s.,”

argued Flynt’s lawyer, Alan Isaac-

man of Beverly Hills, Calif. ”This
is a public figure, somebody
who's supposed to have a thick
skin.”

When Isaacman added that the
effect of the ad is ”HustIer saying,
’Let’s bring this stuffed shirt down
to our level,’ ” the courtroom
erupted in laughter.

Fa|well’s lawyer, Norman Roy
Grutman of New York City,
urged the justices to preserve his
client's legal victory. He called
the sued-over ad ”deliberate, ma-
licious character assassination.”

Before the 60-minute session
began, many in the courtroom
stood or craned necks to catch a
glimpse of Flynt, who during a
1983 argument session was for-
cibly removed from the justices’
presence and arrested for shout-
ing obscenities.

Today, Flynt sat impassively.
But the justices displayed more
animation than usual. V

When Isaacman told of a
200—year-old pol-itical cartoon
that showed Georgewashington

_riding a donkey and referred to
him as ”an ass,” Justice “Antonin,

 .u-.." ~  <

   

Scalia shot.back, ’’I can handle
that. I think George could handle
that.” '

After the courtroom laughter
subsided, Scalia added, ”That’s a
far cry from committing incest
with your mother in an
outhouse.”

At one point, Chief Justice Wil-
liam H. Rehnquist asked Grut-
man what legal protections
should be available to a car-
toonist,who portrays a politician
as ”one big windbag, a turkey.”

Grutman said such portrayals _

are legally protected unless they
represent a ’’worthless kind of
verbal assault.” _

The parody at issue appeared

in the November, 1983, and ‘
March, 1984, issues of Hustler. -

The advertisement, with a pho-
tograph of Falwell, purportedly
quotes him discussing a sexual
encounter with his mother and

describing himself as a habitual‘

drunkard.
At the bottom of the page, in

small print, readers are told that - i
the ad is a parody ”not to be

taken.Se.ri0UsIv—’f.  I .. .

 

Gorbachev interview censored for Soviet TV

THE PlTI' NEWS, Thursday, December 3, I987

 

MOSCOW — Soviet television
censored Mikhail S. Gorbachev’s
comment to NBC News that he
and his wife discuss top govern-
ment affairs but broadcast in full
his statements on touchy topics
such as Soviet troops in Af-
ghanistan.

The exchange between the
Soviet leader and NBC anchor-
man Tom Brokaw about Raisa
Gorbachev took just a brief part
of the private, hour-long inter-
view taped Saturday at the Krem-
lin and broadcast in full in the
United States.

The fact that part of the passage
on Mrs. Gorbachev was deleted

when the.interview was broad-
cast Tuesday night in the Soviet
Union indicates how sensitive
her role is in Soviet society.

Mrs. Gorbachev’s stylish
clothes and frequent presence at
her husband's side have delight-
ed the West but caused some
grumbling in the Soviet Union,
where families of top politicians
have traditionally maintained a
low profile.

Gorbachev also has broken
from the traditional style of Soviet
leaders, pushing for greater open-
ness on certain topics and sweep-
ing economic reforms.

“I grew up in Pittsburgh in the

comedians, reading books." Dillard
learns her world, a grand and paradox-

club. Her father quits his corporation job
and takes his boat down the Ohio River
alone for a few months, down toward
New Orleans. Her mother teaches the
three sisters how to tell a joke, dance all
night, and bet a poker hand.

Dillards ecstatic interest in the world
begins here in childhood. She collects
rocks and insects; sheimakes sharp pencil
drawings; she memorizes faces for detec-
tive work, pitches a baseball, plays with
a microscope, learns psalms, tries ﬂying.

traordinary is Dillards distinctive irony
and humor coupled with the power and

Flutist looks back

 

on colorful career

By Marcia Dunn
Associated Press Writer

PITTSBURGH —— James Gal-

way has been ”noodling away” -

at the flute for four decades, he
likes to say, and he practices
faithfully every day. But for the
pied-piper premier, it's fun, not
work.

”lt’s still my hobby,” Galway
said, his brogue punctuated with
laughs.

”lt’s the same sort of feeling
somebody must get when they
break a world record. I mean, we
break them every day. Because
you only get better. You can't af-
ford to get worse,” he said, relax-
ing in his hotel room before a
recent performance with the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra.

‘Dressed in a baggy, black and
white sweater, black slacks and
black Reeboks, the 5-foot-4 mu-
sician leaned forward as he
mused about ”James Galway 
my very favorite student” and
”my next best friend, which is my
talent.”

’’When you're in my situation,
you owe it to the public and to
the kids who look up to you,” he
said. ”You owe it to them to prac-
tice every day, and you owe it to
them to walk on a platform and
deliver the goods every time 100
percent.”

The 48-year-old Galway has
been delivering the goods with a
flourish to crowds from all walks
of life since he traded in his pen-
ny whistle for a flute at agenine
in his native Northern Ireland and
began weaving magical melo-
dies. , _

Galway has recorded pop,
jazz, Celtic and even country

tunes along with the more tradi- .

tional, classical ﬂute works, many
of them best-selling hits. He's also
appeared on The Tonight Show
and Sesame Street and had his
own television specials.

He's written an autobiography
and is working on another tech-
nical flute book on his com-
puters, two of which accompany
him on tour along with four of his
14, 14-karat gold flutes.

Wife feels her husband is too small

Q: My husband (we got mar-
ried nine weeks ago) is small
down there. While he does
everything right and takes a nice
long time, even during inter-
course, it still doesn't give me an
orgasm. That he can do well in
other ways, but I would like to be
getting more out of intercourse
and more of what women tell me

about. I am not really sure what

that would be because he is the
only man I ever had sex with, but
I am asking the old question, ”Is
that all there is to it?”

ails
on? Q

that some women simply do not
have orgasms from intercourse
without additional stimulation
before, during or after inter-
course. There should be no pres-
sure on you, from you or from
him, to have your climax at that
time in that precise way.

I suggest that you do get a sex
manual and experiment with
different positions. In each pos-
tion, try little variations of move-
ment because each couple has
their own ways of lovemaking.

Doing it with you on top may
work much better for you — but
don't expect it to work like a new
toaster with a guarantee. Try
different moves, making contact
with different areas, and above
all, do enjoy the orgasms he does
give you. The special one you
want is more likely to come if you
are unworried about it.

Incidentally, there are a lot of
women with similar difficulties
whose men are of average or
even larger-than—average size
down there.

Joininglvoices in
protest of inhumanity

This Sunday, people from all over the nation, and in some
cases, the world, will gather in Washington D.C. to protest the
Soviet repression of the Jewish people living there.

For too long, the Soviet Union has escaped without
widespread disparagement of their treatment of their own
citizens. Gorbachev tries to explain tolthe world that the Soviet
Union is attempting to implement a policy of glasnost, of open-

' ness. We wonder what credibility any statement of such inten-

tions can have when literally hundreds of thousands of Soviet
Jews are willing to subject themselves to the persecution of the
state by applying for exit visas. These people, it would seem,
want no part of glasnost. They want out.

Martin Luther King, reminded us that injustice anywhere is

a threat tojustice everywhere.-If it is possible, try to make it _

to Washington this weekend to show your support. If it is im-
possible for you to attend, write your congressman. In the in-
terest of freedom and justice, we can do no less.

G(r)asping in the
darkness of insult

It is said that form obeys function. If that is indeed the case,
what is the function of this year's presidential campaign?

For example: Gary Hart was pushed from the race because
the thrust of expressed public opinion was that he was unfit
for office — that he, because of a sexual liaison, certainly dis-
played an unacceptable lack of judgment. On this week's tele-
vised -debate between the majority of presidential hopefuls, the
most commonly expressed sentiment was not that of ’’I am the

‘ best person for the office because of what I might bring to it,”

but rather, ”I am the best suited because the others are patent-
ly unsuitable.” - . I ’ ‘ V '

The forms are those of slander and insult. They are the forms
of. rising to power not on ability but by default, by the mistakes
of others. Form follows function, which can mean that func-
tion dictates form.

When a child is pressed in an argument, he will insult his
opponent. Lacking a more reasonable path, or lacking sufficient
knowledge, he will seek to win by a barrage of words crafted
to do nothing but hurt. The function is winning, the form is
insult.

In our youth, we were taught that a time would come when-

we should put away childish things. Surveying the electoral
landscape, it appears as if that time has yet to come.

In a nutshell 

Most of the luxuries, and many of
the so-called comforts of life, arenot
only not indispensable, but positive
hindrances to the elevation of
mankind.

-— Henry David Thoreau

Searching among the roots

'I'I'IE NAKED, CITY
PAIJI. ANATER

No one can tell of the vicissi-
tudes through which a man pass-
es as well as he can himself;
therefore in writing this, I must of
necessity make frequent use of
the big personal pronoun first
person singular, trusting that it
will not be looked upon as
egotistical.

That was written by my great-

I great_ grandfather, S. Harper

Smith, in the introduction to his
autobiography. -

This past weekend, I had the in-
credibly good fortune to ”come

I into” a group of writings that I'll

call a multi-generational autobi-
ography of my ancestors.

Researching my genealogy has
long been a favorite pastime of
mine. I consider myself lucky to
have had something such as this
collection of writings fall right
into my lap.

The story starts in the year 1610
— that alone makes my head spin
— and continues to the year
1974. That's 364 years of history

, at my fingertips, andgthat is in-

credible. ,

In addition to the usual genea-
logical things, such as names and
dates, this book contains numer-
ous accounts of frontier life and
bits of philosophy. It is a living
history book, and I'm trembling
over it.

My great-great grandfather
wrote this of his experiences as
a young boy in Canonsburg, Pa.
The following is an account of life
in 1864:

When I was nine years old, we
moved to the farm on which my
mother was born (about two
miles from Canonsburg) where I
grew up a typical country boy,

‘raised in a log—cabin, and ex-

perienced all the hardships of
frontier life except fighting
Indians.

During the time following the
Civil War, the struggle was to get
the farm paid for.  Many a night
after a supper of mush and but-
termilk, I climbed the winding
stairs to bed in the garret, with
nothing between me and the sky

but the shingles and the rafter- J

poles with the bark on, where the
mud wasps built their nests in the
summer and the wind and snow
blew in, in the winter.  Many
a winter morning I have
awakened snug and warm even
between sheets (not blankets) to
find an inch or so of snow cover-
ing my bed and my hair wet from
melted snow.

How I did hate to make the first
move to get up! To step barefoot-
ed into the snow and grabmy
trousers, shake the snow out of
them and crawl in! Woof! Now
after half a century I can still
recall the sensation.

And I bitch about the draft that

comes through my bedroom

windows.

great-great-great grandfather,
John McClure Smith. It was writ-
ten by his youngest son, Harper,
and the year is 1815.

He left home at the age of six-
teen, carrying all his belongings’
in a bandanna handkerchief
slungon a staff, he walked to

Pittsburgh for the purpose of 7

learning a trade, which trade was
cabinet making; serving his time
with one Harmor Denny. This
shop was located on what was at
that time Diamond Alley, about
one square from what is now the
”Park Building” corner of Fifth
Avenue and Smithfield Street. 

But to resume: — At that time
Pittsburgh was only a village;
whole acres of the point were
bare; and Grant's Hill, where the
Courthouse now stands, was a
thicket that (as he expressed it) ”a
chicken couldn't get through it. ”

After their day's work was
done in the shop, the apprentices
used to amuse themselves by
catching frogs in a large frogpond
located where the Kaufmann
building now stands on the corn-
er of Smithfield and Fifth Avenue.

Could you imagine a frggpogd ‘

in downtown Pittsburgh? Or for
that matter leaving home at 16

with all of your belongings in a’

bandanna, before it was a cliche
to do so?

Along with the good ex-
periences these people related
through their writings, bad ex-
periences also abound. Someone
to whom I showed the collection
remarked, ”It would be neat to

live in an earlier time." It would '

have been fascinating, indeed.
But read this:

In 1847 came the terrible
scourge of Scarlet Fever that

made an awful inroad in his fa- .

mily. Six children died in the
short space of 15 days; leaving
only the oldest (13 years) and the
youngest (3 months). Sorrowful
I847!

The following passagejis from
my great-great grandfather's

‘ V’" remembrances of his youth.
The following is about my

Every Autumn I carried to
school, to church, and every-
where I went, that unmistakable
sign of the country boy; — Black
hands from gathering walnuts. I
generally gathered from two to
ten bushels to sell on our annual
fall trip to Pittsburgh; said trip
was a greater event, and more
talked over in our family, than a
trip to Europe would be now.

His family lived only 20 miles
from downtown Pittsburgh. The
concept of ”an annual fall trip to
Pittsburgh" is so foreign to me.

The same man tells of his at-
tempts to save enough money to
get through medical school.

During vacations I helped at
home till the work was done,
then I hired out wherever I could
get a job; I chopped wood, quar-
ried stone, made rails, shoveled
dirt into a cart on the R.R. grade,
or anything at which I could earn
money (wages were $1.00 to

$1.50 a day) for school the next '

Winter.

This treasure I now hold is
amazing in its history alone; what
makes it even more incredible is
that these are_stories of my ances-
tors, in their own words. Wow.

The Heretics

Thursday, December 3, ‘I987

Introducing the single loudest element in Pittsburgh

By Patty Pisula
Staff Writer

When The Heretics rehearse in the
basement of their South Oakland row-
house, it ain't no secret. For the interview,
I first had to sit through one of these en-
durance sessions. Finally, the five sweaty
figures emerged from the depths, and we
talked about everything anyone ever
wanted to know, (and, God, even some
things I'm sure no one wanted to know)
about their history, songwriting, future
and so much more.

Q: What's the age range of the band?
(After much deliberation about the valid-
ity of this question ...)

Jeff (vocals): Twenty-tvvo to 26.

Steve Fabian (guitar): Can we start
over?

Mike Michalski (guitar): Oh, every
young girl out there wants to know how
old we are:

Q: The point is, you were all weaned
on pretty much the same music. So, out-
side of strictly "musical" influences, what

I don't know how to play
jazz, so I play this.
— Elmo

sort of cultural or social influences helped
shape your performance in The Heretics?

Greg Dreg (bass): AEROSMITHI

Jeff: That's a pretty good question. We
don't get asked many good questions, so
I guess we should make the best of this.

Phil (stray boarder): Blood Lust! .

Mike: Shut up, Phil. You're notin the
band. _

Jeff: Films. Foreign films. Art films.
Performance-wise, though, I'd have to say
nothing influences me more than music.

Mike: Performance-wise, for me, kill
flicks!

Jeff: For Mike, definitely splatter flicks!

Mike: I love to see people get axed into
little pieces. And I like Chainsaws and de-
mons that arise and turn into pus. Yeah,
that's performance. That makes me think
good thoughts when I write songs.

Elmo (drums): Naked women!

Mike: Which reminds me, lesbians are
another thing

Would you trust these guys to lhelpyour grandmother cross the street?

Steve: Surf films!

Mike: Naked, attractive lesbians.

Jeff: If you're really talking about ”cul—
tural" influences, poverty, on my part, is
a pretty big thing.

Elmo: Culture has nothing to do with
this music.

Mike: I'm serious —— naked attractive
lesbians are a big influence.

Jeff: Yeah, for heteros. You can put.that
right on the record, too.

Mike: And other lesbians, of course.

Elmo: Why do all of our discussions
end up being about lesbians?

Greg: I'm very influenced by Aer-
osmith.

(Rest of band groans.)

Jeff: That's embarassing.

Elmo: No, that's the intellectual answer
we were waiting for.

Greg: Aerosmith is the most artistic
thing I ever saw. ’

Jeff: More than anything else in the
world? Scooby Doo probably had more
influence on you than that.

Greg: Wait! Didn't the guys on Scoo-
by Doo have a band?

Mike: No they didn't. That was josie
and the Pussycats. A

(Everyone scrambles to remember the
theme song.)

Mike: Elmo, are you going to let "naked
women” be your answer?

Greg: You could probably include
women with clothes on.

Steve: The old feeling of "punk rock,"
although-I hate to categorize by using that
term, is what influences me. What the
Buzzcocks had.

Q: What did they have?

Steve: Good chord progressions.

Mike: They had everything! They had
it all! ~

Elmo: What's a chord? ‘

Steve: A good, fresh sound. That feel-
ing has been lost lately, and I'd like to
retrieve it, not let it die so quickly.

Jeff: Yeah. Like the fact that if you just
read poetry, it bores the hell out of peo-
ple. I've been writing poetry forever.
MOUNDS of poetry 

Mike: You put a few chords to it, peo-
ple listen.

Jeff: Well, if you want to simplify it that
much, it's certainly true. How many
poetry readings have you gone to that
haveireally blown you away? I'd have to
see Charles Bukowski drunk out -of his

 

‘They're not really snotty brats, they're serious musicians.

mind to be impressed with a poetry read-
ing. It's either this or pumping out that shit
they put in the Atlantic Monthly. I'm not
into that.

Q: Considering all that, what ‘do you
think you sound like?

‘ Jeff: LOUD is the only common
denominator.

Greg: Hmmm, that's true.

Mike: We're probably the single
loudest element in the greater Pittsburgh
area.

‘Steve: Beyond loudness, we're just try-
ing not to sound boring  .

Mike: Yeah, exactly.

Steve:  not sound repetitive or, espe-
cially, self-indulgent.

Jeff: We certainly don't sound like
other Pittsburgh bands.

Mike: There was a show last night at the
American Legion Hall. Every band, in its
own way, had something we try not to be.
They had a band that was self-indulgent
and just played guitar licks for their own
beneﬁt -

Jeff: Who would that be? Drop names.

Greg: It doesn't matter.

Steve: It was The Crowflies!

Greg: I love The Crowflies.

Mike: Then The Little Wretches tried to
do the Velvet Underground thing for the
umpteenth time. They had a good mix
[Mike ran sound for them], and they per-
formed well, but it was just more of the
same. The last band, To Damascus, was
very good. I loved them. I probably could
have watched them again. The fact was,
by the end of, the set, they were becom-
ing very repetitive. I strive to make our
music a new adventure for every song. So
no one gets bored, you know?

Steve: That's why it's good that we all
write songs in a different style:

Mike: Each of us writes our songs in-
dividually. Together, our styles create The
Heretics’ sound.

Steve: We're all violently protective of -

ourxown styles.
Q: What creates your cohesiveness? A

band cannot exist on volume alone 
Jeff: ExactIy!! Thanks, Pat!!

. ~_Mike: Exactly, doessomebody rel-s'e_ 1
want to answer thisqu ‘ '

estion? ,

     

 

Jeff: Come on  it's true. What really
ties us together?
Mike: Well, Elmo once put an ad in the

paper that said he wanted to be in a band:

that was "young and snotty"  What
else, Elmo?
Elmo: You're confusing me with The
Dead Boys’ Young, Loud and Snotty.
\ Mike: Weren't The Dead Boys why yo
wanted to join a band? ~
Elmo: Yeah, yeah, that's it. I wanted to
join a band that was young, loud and
snotty. It's all coming back to me..now 
Q: Are you putting words in his mouth?
Mike: No, really. That's what he said.
Elmo: Actually, I wanted to play jazz.
Mike: If you can play young, loud and
snotty, can't you play jazz, too?
Elmo: I don't know how to play jazz,
so I play this. '

The old feeling of ’punk rock’
is what influences me,
although lhate to categorize
by using that term.

— Steve Fabian

Greg: For me, the style of music I
played before this was completely differ-

ent. I was always a big fan [of the other

current Heretics]. Jeff used to play with
Richard [Schnap] in The Third Mind. I

used to go see Bad Martyrs, Elmo's la‘st'

band. And I always went to see The [form-
er] Heretics. The Heretics were my
favorite.

Jeff: Wait, not to be egotistical, but I
think the most cohesive factor is how well
my voice works with the two guitars.

Elmo: Oh, wow. We were on cohesive-
ness. I forgot. . , ~

Jeff: For instance, Frank's [ex-Heretic]
songs, Steve's songs, Mike's songs; when

they sing them, it's a lot different than ‘.

how I ultimately interpret them.

lets our music reach other cities, so we
can tap their limited audiences. Hopeful-
ly, it will inspire them to want to see us
live. I'd have to say the biggest point is
getting the music to other people, other
places.

  Heretics

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 3, I987

 

Continued from page 8

Jeff: And, by God, if there was
somebody in Pittsburgh who
would happen to like this type of
material, the fact that we have
vinyl gives us a little more access
to clubs. So, the people who
want to see The Heretics have a
little bit more access to us ——
somewhere besides our base-
ment. There are lots of other
bands that twiddle around in their
basements until they're 30.

Mike: Why should we waste all
this time just practicing if we're
never going to have something to
show for it? Without a record, the
best we could do in Pittsburgh is
play out every weekend and have
everyone here get bored with us
in two months. With a record, we
have the possibility of becoming
"heard of” across the entire
country.

Q: Why did you decide to
cover The Stooges’ "Search and
Destroy” as your first single?

Jeff: The idea must be directly
attributed to Elmo. Then, after he
had allof us talked into it, he sud-
denly didn't like it anymore!

Elmo: You're right. But by that
poiht, I didn't really have any say
anyway. ‘ _\

Jeff: We all thought we were
doing it justice.

Mike: After I saw The Dead
Boys play it, we played it for a
while with the previous lineup.
That didn't work out. Nobody
could play it right.

Jeff: Hey, Black Flag did
"Louie, Louie.” We did "Search
and Destroy.”

Steve: We all liked it. It was the
favorite song of each of us, at one
time or another.

Jeff: We tried to do Cheap
Trick’s "Surrender." It just wasn't

I there. We didn't do it.

Greg: Oooo, that didn't work
at all.

Jeff: I like covers. If a band can
add its strong points to material
other people wrote, they should
do it. As for "Search and Des-
troy,” we emulate it, but we push
it further. We recapture it in a
modern sense.

Mike: It's a good enough ver-
sion that people won't say, "Boy,
The Stooges did a way better
job.” They'll say, "Wow, this is
a lot different than the way The
Stooges did it.” It's easy for peo-
ple to criticize covers because
they're used to the original. But
they won't be able to say. this
sucks because it just doesn't.

Elmo: In fact, after they hear
our version, they'll say, "I never
realized how much the produc-
tion of the original sucked!"

Jeff: Also, all those people who

" I like The Stooges and who never

heard of us will be interested

enough to wanna hear it. "Hey

Betty, isn't this an Iggy Pop song?
I wonder what they do with it.”
So it's also a fine marketing
technique. '

Elmo: We should mention
other bands that have covered it,
like The Dictators and The Dead
Boys!

Jeff: We destroy The Dictators’
version.‘

Mike: Not to mention The

‘Dead Boys’ version.

Jeff: To tell you the truth, I've
never heard The Dead Boys’
version.

Elmo: What?! .

Mike: They only do it live. It's
always sloppy and out- of tune.

Q: What are the odds of more
vinyl, say, 12 inches worth?

Mike: The album will be out on
Skyclad Records. Gregg Kostelich

 

and I are tying up some loose
ends right now. It'll have 13 to 15
songs.

Q: All originals?

Mike: There’ll be one cover.

Q: What is it? _

Steve: We'll just have to wait
and see, won't we?

Mike: The album will be a lot
more diverse than the single, es-
pecially when you consider that

it will have 15 songs, and the sin-
gle only has two.

Q: What do you think of
Pittsburgh? I

Jeff: Do you want the truth? I
really don't like anybody in Pitts-
burgh. It's stale, boring. What can
I say? I wanna leave this city.

Mike: We can barely get Jeff to
come to our shows.

Greg: In fact, we're always ner-

vous because he’s nowhere
around. He always makes this
grand entrance at the last minute.

Q: I wanna go home now, so
do you have any closing

Y comments?

Mike: I would like to thank
Gregg Kostelich very much for
putting out the single.

Greg: We love that guy.

Mike: He did a great job with

{_—

the mastering and everything.’
Our single will probably be bet— '
ter than any other Get Hip release
in the next 10 years!

Everyone: We love thatlguyl

Mike: Oh, anybody who reads ' 

this that has a spare $4,200, we
need to buy a mini-Winnebago.
Jeff: Yeah. I want The Heretics

Illinois set to face Lady Panthers at NCAA

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball
team will be in action tonight
against the University of Illinois
in the opening round of the wom-
en's NCAA volleyball champion-
ship at Champaign, Ill.

Coaching the Lady lllini will be
former Pitt coach Mike Hebert.
Hebert was instrumental in estab-
lishing the Pitt program as one of

the finest in the East. While he
was at Pitt (1976 to 1979), the
Lady Panthers annually made the
regional Final Four. In Hebert’s
last year, Pitt won the regional ti-
tle of the AIAW (Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Wom-
en), a predecessor of the NCAA
women's championships.
When asked to assess this
year’s'edition of the Lady Pan-
thers, the Illinois coach respond-
ed, ”I’ve seen Pitt play, and it

Miller shoots down

zone; Panthers beat
St. Francis, 88-70

By John Enright

Editor in Chief

With Al|—American candidates
Charles Smith and Jerome Lane
looming large, Jim Baron took

‘away Pitt's inside game and

challenged the Panthers young
freshmen guardsto beat his St.
Francis Red Flash.
Unfortunately for ‘St. Francis,
Pitt freshman Sean Miller took
Baron's challenge and buried it.
__Mi|ler tied a Pitt record with six
3-point field goals (in six ’at-

tempts) as the Panthers beat St. '

Francis, 88-70, last night at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

’’l was happy I got hot. Their
zone was giving me the shot,”

said Miller, whofinished the

game with a team-high 20 points
and seven assists.

”Sean’s a good shooter. Once
we get [Rod] Brookin back that
will make our offense that much
better,” said Pitt coach Paul
Evans. -

Baron packed his team in a
tight zone defense, trying to take
away the inside game of Smith,
the Panthers’ 6—foot—1O center,
and Lane, the 6-6 power forward
who led the nation in board-
crashing last season.

Baron's theory was effective for
awhile at least. His team was

A down only two points at halftime,

36-34. Lane and Smith combined

I for only 11 points in the half (10
by Smith).

Pitt was outrebounded 16-10 in
the first 20 minutes, with Smith
andLane grabbing only four re-
bounds each.

St. Francis didn't appear intimi-
dated by Pitt's front line and the
Red Flash played an inspired
first-half.

Women's basketball poised for Penn State

By Matt Martin
Staff Writer

The 1-1 Lady Panthers basket-
ball team traveled to Washington
last night to take on the American
University women's squad. As of
press time, results of the game
were not yet available.

Over the Thanksgiving
weekend, the Lady Panthers
traveled west to compete in the
University of Nevada Las Vegas

Pitt jumped to a 25-18 lead
with 7:39 remaining, but St. Fran-
cis went on a nine-point run, to
take a surprising 27-25 lead.

Miller answered with a
3—pointer giving the Panthers a
28-27 advantage.

Later in the half when the Red .

Flash went up by one, Miller
stuck a 20-foot jumper from the
right wing.

After the game Baron still ad-
hered to‘ his game plan, despite

. the torrid shooting of Miller.

”Pitt is an outstanding basket-
ball team. They do an excellent
job with their inside game and
they have two great players in
Smith and Lane. We felt if we
were going to get beat, it was go-
ing to be from the perimeter,”
said Baron.

’’I thought Sean Miller did a
great job of shooting 3-pointers.
He was shooting with confi-
dence. If there was anyone who
was going tobeat us it was going
to be the freshmen. If we had any
kind of chance, [the zone] was
it.”

As was the‘ case against Robert

Morris last Saturday, the Panthers-

left their game faces somewhere
outside the Fitzgerald Field
House. ”With the team we have,
we should have been up by at
least 10 at halftime,” said Lane.

The Panthers led Robert Mor-

_ ris by only three points at inter-

mission and Evans verbally
assaulted his lax squad at hal-
ftime. This time around they got
the silent treatment. ”I didn't say
much at halftime. I gave them my
spiel last week,,but you can't do
that every night.”

Lane says that's the way it
should be.

”What can [Evans] say? We

chipped in against UNLV with 12

But, as much as he was im-

Kirk Bruce was just as pleased
with his newcomers. ”Our new-

said. Junior college A transfer

As college football nears the
end of the regular season, the
Syracuse Orangemen are faced
with the distinct possibility of
finishing their season with a per-
fect 12-0 record, if they can han-
dle Auburn in the Sugar Bowl.
But unless South Carolina upsets
the Miami Hurricanes on Dec. 5,
the Orangemen will have no
chance of winning the national ti-
tle because the unbeaten Hurri-_
canes will face undefeated
Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl,

and the winner of that game is a
lock for No. 1.

Almost every year, especially
in situations like the one I just
described, a debate will rage:
Should there be a playoff system
for college football? Should Syra-
cuse be given the opportunity to
prove, through head-to-head
competition, that they are capa-
ble of beating Miami or Oklaho-
ma and therefore deserving of the
national title?

Let me be the ﬁrst to admit that
I think Syracuse could beat the
Sooners. Maybe you think they
couldn't. Maybe you think they

Top 10.

Such a disagreement as this is
just one of several reasons why
college football should not adopt
a playoff structure.

Arguing over who is No. 1 is
one of the things that makes col-
lege football great. It stirs up con-
troversy. It inspires people to
come up with elaborate lines of
reasoning as to why their team is

the best. It creates anticipation as _

best. It may cause the blood of
snubbed Syracuse fans to boil,
but in short, it's good for the
game.

Consider the case of the 1969
Penn State Nittany Lions. That
team will be remembered and
talked about forever for having
been snubbed by the polls,
despite a perfect record, after
President Nixon proclaimed the
Texas Longhorns to be the best in
the land. Coach Joe Paterno then

Had there been a playoff in 1969
in which the Lions toppled Texas
to become national champs, then
who but faithful Penn Staters
would ever remember the 1969‘
Nittany Lions today? Or 10 years
from now? Let's face it, the Great

mous. And isn't the "Paterno

"We have a lot of young peo-
ple playing. They can’t come in
the first two games and be in the
flow. We got a lot to work on
right now. We're not doing the
things we're supposed to be do-
ing. We're three beats behind
key,” said Lane.

"We had four freshman on the
floor a lot and it's like coaching
a freshman team in some ways.
I feel pretty good the way the
freshman are coming on, but they
have to come a lot further," said
Evans.

But Lane, never one to get
pumped up for "rinky—dink"
teams, isn't too concerned. "As
long as we're there at the end of
the season. That's all that
counts." _ —

Gymnast Freehling thinks Bow]

improvement is motivation

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

_ Gymnast Brock Freehling con-
tinually improves himself by striv-
ing to reach his goals.

Freehling, a sophomore from
Leechburg, Pa., sets goals for
himself at every meet.

’’I always try to hit my routines
and score as high as I can. As
long as I feel I did the best that
I could, I'm satisfied.” Freehling
went on to say, ”For myself, just
knowing that I'm improving,
that's enough motivation to keep
me going for the next couple of
years. I always want to beat my
last year's scores, and each meet,
I want to get a better score.”

Last April, Freehling had sur-
gery on his ankle, from which he
hasn't fully recovered. One of
Freeh|ing’s goals is to have full
use of it by Jan. 16, the first
regular-season meet._

In his spare time, Freehling
teaches gymnastics to children. “J

The brothers and sisters of
THETA NU GAMMA wish to
congratulate this year's elfin
king and queen, who will be
crowned at our annual Christ-

mas bash! Way to go Vivian and
Richard!
The elfin court: Frances and Todd,
' lst runners up, Sue and Chris 5., 2nd_
runners up, and Sam and Tracy, 3rd
runners up.
Maybe you'll win next year, F 

enjoy it, and maybe someday I'd
like to coach.”

All of Freeh|ing’s coaches have
influenced him, from his high
school coach, Dem Answine, to
his coach here, Frank D’Amico.

Freehling decided to go to Pitt
because ”it was mainly the gym-
nastics, and it was close to
home.”

Freehling became interested in
gymnastics when he was in
elementary school. When he was
in seventh, eighth and ninth
grades, Freehling competed atlthe
high-school level.

Freeh|ing’s favorite event is the
floor exercise, which he also feels
is the easiest.

’’I worked on the floor the most

during high school, so it's my,

best event. But the event that is
the most fun is the high bar be-
cause I can just let myself go.”

Freehling thinks that this year's
team could score a 270 and be
in the Top 25. ’’If we work hard
enough, I think we could achieve
that.”

About the team spirit this year,
Freehling said, ”This year, the
team unity is good, but we have
some individuals. But at Navy,
we were really pulling for each
other. I think as the year progress-
es, we'll become a lot closer. We
should do much better this year.”

The problem with balancing
academics and athletics, accord-

. ing to Freehling, is that ”any sport

takes a lot out of you, but it's
worth it.”

money-grubbing, corporate-
affiliated games worth the artifi-
cial turf they're played on? Can
we really respect a bowl system
in which the Independence
Bowl, in Shreveport, La., invites
the 6-5 Tulane Green Ripple just
so it can sell tickets (Tulane be-
ing from nearby New Orleans)?

Yes. Despite some valid argu-
ments to the contrary, bowl
games, like the wire-service polls,
are good for the game.

I guess what I'm trying to say
is that striving for and speculating
on bowl bids adds something ex-
tra to the season for both the play-
ers and the fans.

With the current bowl system,
a team such as Michigan State

can go to the Rose Bowl, have a . ;.

great time in sunny Southern
California, then win the game (I
know, the Big 10 never wins) and
gain some momentum and some-
thing to build on for next season.
The same thing can happen in the
Orange, Liberty, Bluebonnet and
all the other bowls.

But in a playoff system, there
can be only one winner. Only
one team can end their season
with a victory. Only one team
can be satisfied with their post-
season performance. Everyone
else goes home a loser.

College football is a thriving
sport. There is no reason for it to
try and be more like the business-
like NFL.

Save the bowls.
