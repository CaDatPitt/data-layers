2 S.U. Staff Members Resign

Two Student Union staff mem-

with Student Union duties.

Miss Waters plans to be married
soon and declares that “her re-
sponsibilities to her husband come
ﬁrst.” Larry Heller will enter
graduate school to obtain his ad-
vanc:d degrees in speech and
drama.

Heller has been with the Stu-
dent Union since it began to oc-
cupy its present building. He was
a graduate of the University in
1958 and made the transition be-
tween student and administrator
under the tutelage of Dr. Swartz-
baugh, then head of the Student
Union. '

From his major love, dramat-
ics, Heller found it easy to enter
the programming of student ac-
tivities. He has directed the

interfere ’

   

speakers on music and perform-

ers are featured. Recently he
assumed the duties ‘ of director

of the Midday Series program
succeeding Dr. Cooper.
Judy Waters started to work in

student affairs when Dr. Cooper
became head of the Student Union
in 1959. She’ had been a student
under him at Allegheny College
where she received her degree in
English.

Miss Waters is responsible for
all scheduled events that take
place in the Student Union. As a
liaison between the Dean of
Women’s staﬂ and the Union, she
is part of the Dean of Women's
staff and is a freshman seminar
leader. She is also head of the
dance committee and the jazz
committee.

Miss Waters has said, “I am
sure that the staff will do all to
continue the programs that have
been successful and continue to
meet the student desires as we
have done.” '

Report To Trustees
Reveals Findings

Of Board Of Inquiry

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld has officially cleared
history professor Robert G. Colodny of subversive charges
with a seven page summary of facts compiled by the three-

man investigating committee.

The report — addressed to Gwilym A. Price, chairman
of the Board of Trustees —- was immediately criticized by

Noted Chinese
Sociology Prof

To Speak Here

Dr. Marion J. Levy, Jr.,
professor of Sociology from
Princeton University, will
speak at the University’s Pub-
lic Health Auditorium on
Wednesday at 8 p.m.

Dr. Levy’s address, “The Stabil-
ity of Traditional Chinese Social
Structure,” will be the last, in a
current lecture series on China
being presented by the Univer-
sity’s Chinese Language and Area
Center.

A member of the Princeton. fac-
ulty since 1947, Dr. Levy is also
a member of the Editorial Board
of “Behavioral Sciences,” and the
Board of Directors of the Human
Relations Area Files.

Dr. Levy has written articles
for “American Economic Re-
view,” “American Sociological
Review,” “Behavioral Science”
and the “British Journal of So-
ciology.”

In 1952, Dr‘. Levy prepared an
article, “Contrasting Factors in
the Modernization of China and
Japan,” for the Social Science Re-
search Council Conference on Eco-
nomic Growth in Selected Coun-
tries. He was awarded a three-
year Ford Foundation Grant for a
study of Japanese Social struc-
ture in 1957. ‘

The Professor received his B.A.
degree from Harvard University,
his M.A. degree from the Univer-
sity of Texas, and his A.M. and
Ph.D. degrees from Harvard.

Dr. Levy’s lecture is the ﬁfth
and last of the Chinese Lan-
guage and Area Center’s current
series. On June 7, Wing-Tsit
Chan, Professor of Chinese
Culture and Philosophy at Dart-
mouth College, spoke on “Zen
Buddhism and Neo—Confucian-
ism.” Lord Lindsay of Birker,
Professor of Far’ Eastern Stud-
ies at the American University
of Washington, discussed “Con-
tinuity and Change in Chinese
Political Institutions,” on May
24.

 

Representative John. T.
Walsh, who decried a lack of sup-

porting evidence. However, at the

same time Dr. Edward D. Eddy,

Jr., president of Chatham College,
commended the Chancellor for his
supporting stand concerning Dr.
Colodny.

In the opening remarks of the
Chancellor’s report the Ameri-
can university w as deﬁned
as a place of free inquiry, but
no member of the University of
Pittsburgh harbors any idea that
American society should be re-
placed by another.

This sweeping statement in-
cludes Dr. Colodny. The rest of
the report examines the ﬁndings
of the committee headed by Philip
H. Powers, assistant chancellor for
development.

The c o m m i t t e e ascertained
through several thousand pages of
evidence and months of effort
that “Dr. Colodny is a loyal Amer-
ican, is not now and never had
been a Communist and is not a
subversive person as deﬁned by
the Pennsylvania Loyalty Act of
1951.”

Dr. Colodny’s dealings with
Communist an d Communist-
front organizations were denied
as being pro—Communist, rather
as simply anti-Fascist. The re-
port states. “He (Colodny)
brands Marxist doctrines as fal-
lacious and believes that Com-
munism has no place in a highly
developed society such as ours."

Dr. Colodny has deﬁned his po-
sition in a brief statement issued
recently .

Bandit Foiled
In Robbery of
Food Lockers

An Oakland man attempted to
ransack a Schenley Hall locker
and snatched a purse Thursday,
witnesses said. ‘

At about 7 p.m. the suspect,
Samuel Miller, of Aliquippa
Street, was reported to have grab-
bed a purse belonging to Mary
Davidson, a visitor to the Univer-
sity, before ﬁeeing up the steps
from the SU_ basement. He was
chased by several students before
he dropped the purse and the stu-
dents surrounded him.

Prior to the arrest Miller was
observed by Richard Williams, an
employee of SAGA food service,
tampering with the lockers of
SAGA employees which are lo-
cated in the SU basement. Wil-
liams and Miller scuffed when
the SAGA employee questioned
him. ‘

The suspect then ﬂed the locker '

room to the stairway where he
encountered Miss Davidson.

Miller was immediately arrest-
ed by Ofﬁcer Jim Cronin and sent
to No. 4 police station where a
hearing was to be held.

Kathy Rahill, education fresh-
man, and Jacques Wertheimer,
arts sophomore, observed the de-
fendant with the purse.

Poor Record

MittersEnd
Year With
5- 1 0 Mark

Jim Brosnan, the relief art-
ist of the Cincinnati Reds, au-
thored a best-selling book,
“The Long Season,” which
could aptly headline a resume
of the 1961 Pitt baseball sea-
son.

In the opening contest of» the
campaign, the Panthers were ex-
tended to extra-innings before
they succumbed 9-8 to California
State (of the Pennsylvania vin-
tage). And in the ﬁnals they suf-
fered through fourteen innings
until 1:00 a.m. before bowing, 3-2,
to Fort Lee, Virginia.

Jim Sylvis, who authored a no-
hitter midway in the year, and
failed to even win thereafter,
struggled on the mound during the
entire marathon battle. Perhaps
Jim will retreat to the typewriter
and write a eulogy, “The Longer
Season.”

In between these two “sweat-
ers” the Cats dropped eight out
of thirteen “breathers” and ﬁn-
ished with a 5-10 record. A .333
percentage may realize the uto-
pia of most major league play-
ers, but team-wise it is sad. _

In fact, it was also an unreal-
ized dream individual-wise. This
represents one of the poorest years
that Coach Bobby I.,ewis has ever
enjoyed.

The Pitt nine completed a good
share oftheir schedule with a
minimum‘ roster,_ badly d_epl_e_ted
by drop-outs and a few inelible
members. The trimester, in gen-
eral, was their toughest foe.

Coach Lewis is now heading a
baseball school in the district with
Pirate stars and other major
leaguers instructing. It would be
nice if their success rubs off on the
Blue & Gold.

Just Briefin It

Snodgrass

Midday Poet
Gives Advice
By PAT CHERKIN
The advantage of being a
poet, said W. D. Snodgrass,
1960 Pulitzer Prize winner, is
that you can tell the world
about the operations you’ve
had and get away with it.
Talking with the coffee-hour
audience in conjunction with last
week's Midday Series, the poet
was referring, in particular, to
“Operation,” a poem from his col-
iection, “Heart’s Needle.” Snod-
grass, however, meant more than
operations. He touched upon an

important aspect of writing, be it
poetry or ﬁction. \

All beginning writers tend to
pour ‘forth tales of their opera-
tions, graduations, aspirations, ex-
asperations, and humiliations. Few

ipoets, though, at so early an age,

can bring their reader to em-
pathize with the power of the
emotion which is intimate to the
writer.
Snodgrass has succeeded in
his little poem, “Heart‘s Nee-
dle,” which is a cycle of pas-
sages written seasonally to his
daughter from whom he has
been separated by divorce. His
success is in his power to make
the reader feel his own pathos.
His talk, Fact In Poetry, often
sounded like a professor’s pre-
pared speech on the techniques of
writing and carried with it the
expected amount of disjointure
and boredom. At the same time,

he hit upon interesting and use-

ful ideas.

Snodgrass’ poetry was disappoint-
ing. But Snodgrass, the man, was

future he will prove also to be a
great poet.
