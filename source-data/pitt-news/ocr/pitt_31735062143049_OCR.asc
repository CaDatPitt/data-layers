leave for a two-week refresher
course this afternoon.

Mr. Digby, chief dispatcher, took
time out to explain the purpose of
"the course. “It’s a wonderful
thing,“ he said. “And it’s in keep-
ing with the spirit that is Pitt.”
Digby -pivoted ; toward room 106,
bow'ed his head, and then con-
tinued: ,

”“A lotof you .people probably

think therops are insulting by

sheer accident. But that ain’t so,”
‘he explained. His expression be-
came almost ﬁendish as he con-
ﬁded this last bit of information.
“It’s a deﬁnite program. We
don’t want any polite‘Pcrcys on
our stall. If they cant master the
sarcastic touch, out they go.” Mr.
Digby swelled with pride. “You
have to beherc inthe basement to

“I see them all, large and small,
men, and w0men--even -tire fac-

member a few of the quips to tell

“How about this

Mr. Digby launched into an en-
thusiastic harangue. “The idea

By La Roth .

The Hatfields and the McCo‘ys
‘reign supreme as the 1onevfued-
ers in the nation. This morning in
a memorable meeting, Hames
J agan, athletic director and track
coach Cal Colsen ertj'1braced in

" the athletic oifice.
“Itwasall a gag,” said Cal. “l »

have nothing but thei.deepest'es—
teem for _Hamey.” To prove his
point, Mr. Colsen slapped Jagan
arniably across the back. After he
picked up. the scattered‘ teeth,
Jagan‘ climbed to his feet and the
two ipals got to reminiscing. ' ' ’
, “We almost came "together in
"38, didn’t we Cal?” asked Ham-
as. “Yeah,” replied the smiling
Mr. ,Colsen. f‘That wasthe year
we put the kidsto Sock Under-
land the football coach,” he con-'
tinued, 1  7 * ' 3
“You know Hamey I ‘thought
‘you were on your way out,.. too,”
' chuckled Colsen; “Yes sir you
really raised a rumpus there.”

Jagan lowered his head mod-
estlyi-and quickly changed the
subject. “Pressure from above,” be
demurred. “But I’d do, it again.
Yes sir, I surely would.”

Noticing the evident‘ embarass-
ment of M_r. J agan, Colsen quickly
changed the subject. “Say Harney
old boy, couldn’t we arrange a

-track. meet for every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday?” he ask-
ed. . ’ . _.

The Portly athletic. "director
wrinkled his brow. “You know

that means plenty of work, Cal,” .’

he said.’ He led‘ off with several

“ahs” and ‘then brought forth a '

new proposal. ~-“How. about a meet

on‘ Mondays and-Fridays?” he ask— V

‘-‘Cal hesitated a moment and 3

proved his greatness by readily
acquiescing. “Why, that’s fair
enough Hamey,” he said. Mr. Col-

sen changed tack again, “Say, eh-ow ,
long do you intend to let Mulliganff ’

-stay around here?” queried Mr;
Colsen. '

At this point, G.’ s. Rum_p.wad--

dled -in." “Hi Rumpy,” they chor-
ussed. “Say, boys, just how are you
going to ﬁnance this deal?,’’ quer-
ied Rump. -

“I got it!” shouted J agan, “Yeah,
I got it too" exclaimed Colsen,
“We’ll pay off that damned’sta-
dium and we may even be able to

Athletic Director Approves x T

James Hagen, .lohn’s other son, expressed his full, accordance
with Chancellor'Fitzgerald’s de-emphasis program at a press confer-_.

ence held in the athletic ofﬁce;toda'y.

No one attended the conference. v »

“This do nothing spirit will greatly aid the ‘athletic oﬂ‘i€!‘e in the 

fulﬁllment of_ our plans,” said Mr. Hagen in an unofficial. statement. -

The once‘ Pitt man went on to explain that the de-emphasis of it 4

“Win ’em all? Hell, no. But, it
keeps my name in the,papers. You
can’t keep turning Y out those
mediocre teams and expect to "hold

the. fans a little entertainment.”

This revealing and almost revo-
ldtionary disclosure was released
today by Doc Larson. “If I de-‘
pendedon myrecord to stay at
Pitt, I’d be a practicing medico to‘-.
day,” he said. . ‘ e ,

“It’s easy,” he_ continued. “I rip

and praise my boys. It’s a living,”
he-sighed." .  «.

‘ “Thanks, . Doc. ‘Great guy isn’t
