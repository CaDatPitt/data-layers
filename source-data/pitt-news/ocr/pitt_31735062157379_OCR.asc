Of Top Sophomores

After an absence of over two years, Druids returned  active
status this ‘week and prepared to tap its ﬁrst new members since

Long recognized at the University as the scholastic and activities
honorary for sophomore men, Druids -fell by the” wayside in
April 1946, largely due to the results of the war and inability to
mantain its traditional place in the post-war rush swamped the Uni-
'¥versity with thousands of new stu-

dents.

The gradual acclimation to
new enrollment and some - new

ideas concerning tapping methods_
- led in December, 1947 to the for-

mation of a committee to reacti-
vate Druids.
Late in May, 1948 this commit-

tee, headed by Bill Raines and .

Mort Lerner, received permission

from the men’s fraternity com-

inittee to reactivate the fraternity.
Former Druids to Tap '

‘ The committee of former Druids
composed of Larry Burwinkel,
Dick Matson, Mort Lerner, Dick
Hargrave, Bill Raines, and -Dr.
John M: Ferguson, faculty advisor,
will tap 15 men to membership
this fall; These 15 will ﬁien be-
come ‘the active members of
Druids and will carry on the "fra-
ternity program. -

In contrast to ~the.qu'estionab1e
methods of tapping whichledi to

bership of the new Druids will be --

determined by an activities ‘point

A. scale system and a basic scholastic

requirement of a 1.5 quality point

It is possible to _imagine Kopelman be-

he was ﬂattened by a 240 pound mass of
humanity, and immediately subscribed to
the theory that the healthiest exercise for
a shrimpis a long hike in the woods. Now
he iswa college player, no less.

If All Starfed Like This

Here is how the confusion started. It is
“High School Day” at the Stadium and the
Pitt players are busy establishing themselves
as heroes in the eyes of several thousand
youngsters by beating Marquette. After the
game,-about 35 kids gather outside the dress-

the most friction between room-
mates.
Personal habits, althoughi m-

' portant, did not seem to cause

as much trouble.” These are
the conclusions Miss Nelson, a

graduate of Mount Holyoke Co1— "

lege, who served with the Red
Cross during the war, -put into-
a thesis for her masters in Ed-
usation.

She says she asked the girls to
rate .their roommates on some
26 points including such facts as

.,.neatness and cleanliness, re-

ligious background, extra cur-

ricular interests, sense of humor,

and economic background. ’
Most of the girls, she ‘says,

‘are satisﬁed with their room-

"mates, agreeing with them on’
such matters as sleeping hours,
‘borrowing, moral standards and
ideals. , "

Cause for most disagreements
she said, appear to be thelack
of similar courses or outside ac-
tivities, differences in sorority
affiliation, and a lack of coop-
eration in housekeeping.

that:

“Dormitories should be erected

Choral Group

Intercollegiate Chorale of Pitts-
burgh, under the direction of
Mary Scanlon of Pitt’s music de-
partment, will meet Thursday at
7_:30 p. m. in the First Baptist
church, Bayard and Belleﬁeld
streets. '

The chorale, begun at the Uni-
versity by Miss Scanlon, has a
number of members from Tech,
P.C.W., Duquesne,
Mercy. '

This is the only group of its kind
among Pittsburgh colleges. Mem-
bership is open to graduate and
undergraduate students in the
city.

Father Eloy I. Grundler, new moderator of Newman Club has
been appointed Chaplain ‘or Catholic students.
i Father Grundler, a graduate of Duquesne in 1936, was awarded
his M.A. at St." Vincent College in 1938 and was ordained in 1940.
After ordination, Father Grundler was sent to St. Brendan’s
Church, Braddock, where he held the following posts:-‘District Director
of the Holy Name Society, Publicity Director of the Red Cross Blood
Bank, and psychology instructor at Braddock General Hospital.‘ All
this was in addition to his regular church duties. .
From Braddock, Father Grundler was sent to Assumption
Church in Bellevue. There he supervised one of the largest and

and Mount _,

 

A 930st modern parish centers in
the diocese, McGovern Hall.

Father Grundler revealed he has
several innovations in mind for
Newman Club.

The club now has members at
Pitt, Tech, Duquesne, Mt. Mercy,
and P.C.W. Father Grundler
wants to estab_lish separate chap-
ters at each school. Each group
would govern itself, and yet re-
main under the guidance of a cen-
tral authority.

Wants Separate Chapter

A night school and graduate
school chapter of the club here is
another aim of Father. Grundler.
He is certain allthis will take
place within the year.

Father Grundler stresed that
the $4 per year dues paid to the
club entitles members to all social
events. There are no other as-
sessments, he emphasized.

In line with Newman Club pol-
icy will be a series of discussions
conducted by Father J . P. Knight.
These discussions will be held in

Ford at E&M’s
Autumn Dance

“There’s a certain popular make
automobile in your future” at the
Engineering and Mines dance,
Friday, Nov. 5, Job White, pub-
licity chairman for E '& M. Asso-
ciation, promises. _

The engineers, topping a mem- _
bership drive this week, are giv-

ing away one of Henry Ford’s-

products at their Fall dance at
West View Park.

Chairman White claims the
prize to be “one of the most un-
usual and spectacular prizes to be
given away at any Pitt function,
or at any college aﬁair, fornthat
matter.” a

As if a genuine Ford isn’t in-
ducement enough, E & M cabinet
is offering Baron Elliott’s music
plus free admission to association
members. Laymen and non—mem-
ber engineers pay $3.25 for ad-
mission.

E & M Association is still ac-
cepting a limited number of new
members, despite its growing
ranks, announced Professor Wil-
liam Rudley, advisor to the group.

Students who signed up at regis-
tration may obtain their cards at
the Student Desk now, while any-
one in the Engineering and Mines
School who has failed to ﬁll in a
membership application may do
so before Oct. 26. No applications
will be received after that date.

Speaking on a subject close to
his heart, Dr. H. C. Carlson, Pitt
basketball coach, will address the
Washington County Teachers’ In-
stitute Friday. The topic—“Fa-
tigue.”

tours of their respective plants.
The purpose of the course, ac-_
cording to Mr. Turkes, is,“to give

chance to ‘see engineers at work
in various types of industry so
that he might be better» able to —

choosehis branch of engineering.”
Engineering students at Pitts-

to so many large and important
industries of‘ the nation, Mr.
Turkes believes. At many other
schools, long trips are necessary
to bring the student in’ contact
with actual plants in ' operation.
For instance, West Virginia Uni-
versity places the course in the
senior year and sponsors a Week’s
tour spent mostly in the Pitts-
burgh district.

Mr. Turkes blamed the small
June enrollment on the high
school student’s usual reluctance

Despitepthe fact that Marquette’s. play was, as Hilltopper assist-

each TD, now leads Pitt scorers
with seven placement conversions.

Saturday Fullback Bob Becker
and reserves Nick DeRosa, an end,
and Jack Smodic, defensive half-
back, -- added their names to the
scorebook. ,

Becker Scores First

Becker came ﬁrst, crashing over
from thelvlarquette one to snap
the double ’whit‘ewash ‘after 341/2
minutes of action. Jimmy Joe Rob.-
inson’s brilliant cross—ﬁeld sprint
of 61 yards with a Bobby Lee pass
set it up.

This turn of events temporarily
roused the listeless I-Iilltoppers.

Just as Pitt-scored after ‘receiv- 

ing the second half kickoff, Mar-
quette surged 46 yards to paydirt
after Jerry Hiller had scooted 49
yards with Blokovac’s kickoff.
Pitt’s Lee tried to break the 7-7
tie immediately, when he picked

But Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi, who
had been having a bad afternoon
trying to pass, heaved a long pass
to DeRosa who never broke stride
as he gathered in the pigskin and
loped 82 yards for the tally.

This score decided the contest,
but Jack Smodic iced it with just

a little more than a minute left..

He hovered. under a Marquette

“p_op-up” pass, grabbed it, and-

ankled 45 yards into the corner
of the end zone.

Smodic had intercepted a pass and
traveled 45 yards for a touchdown.

The pass was deﬁected high into
the air by a charging -Pitt lineman,
and Smodic looked like he was
playing centerﬁeld again for Ralph
Mitterling’s baseball team as he
came in to make the catch.

“It was my ﬁrst score since my
high school days at German Town-
ship,” said Smodic. “Brother, I

Harry (Chick) Jagade, Indiana fullback, has gained among many

Clyde Smith's Indiana Squad
Shows Lack of Strongﬁubs

By BOB VAN ATTA_

Something that Pitt- has never acciomplished, a. victory
overlndiana on the gridiron ,is closer to tl1e possibility stage

, this fall.

Five games in the series, all since 1942, have resulted in
Hoosier victories. However, Clyde Smith’s array is somewhat

‘juries but thus far this year has
managed to stay in playing con-

Sparking the Hoosier backﬁeld
are three top drawer men, which
is the main reason for their sur-
prising showing. Hitting the head-
lines most frequently is halfback
George Taliaferro.

Sebek and dynamo Taliaferro
regulate the skyway offense.

In his ﬁrst year as Indiana
coach, Smith, a singlewing advo-

reserve strength and quarterback

So much has the lack of re-

The Medical Sophomore A team
established themselves as out-
standing contenders ’ for Profes-

i' sional league honors in their first

game, trouncing the ’ previously
undefeated Medical Sophomore B

team, 25-6, at Trees ﬁeld. .

The victors scored all their
points in the ﬁrst half. Tom Lom-
bard threw a ﬁve-yard pass to
Jim Scott, who‘ traveled 50 yards
for the ﬁrst TD. Thelsecond score
came on a 15-yard pass from
Lombard to Dave Cherup.

Two more tallies came in the
second period on an aerial from
Scott to Wally Zernich and a 50-
yard heave from Gary Bell to
Cherup.

Second half action was more
even. It was played mostly in the
center of the ﬁeld. Midway in the
ﬁnal quarter, Lou Meyers blocked
an A team kick and.the B’s took
possession on the “A” 18.

A pass, Meyers to Joe Mazza,
put the ball on the one-yard line.
Then Meyers passed to Dave
Miller for the losers’ only score.

Retail Training Students Draw
Tough But Colorful Schedule

By LOIS HITE

Next time you complain about
walking to Alumni Hall for a
four—hour lab, consider the 108
students taking retail training.
These students ride a streetcar
downtown to eight-hour lab in one
of Pittsburgh’c department stores
as often as three times a week.

There are compensations, how-
ever.

A lab period spent in Horne’s
college shop, amid paper-shell
china on Kaufmann’s seventh ﬂoor,
or in the Frank and Seder down-
stairs store, boasts color that out-
shines any campus lab.

Only School Like It

These laboratories are only a
part of the uniquesness that be-

.longs to the‘ School of Retail

Training; it is the only graduate
school of its kind in the country.
That claim is as valid today as it

 

was thirty years ago when the
school was founded. a

For thirty years, Pittsburgh’s
best inillinery departments, smoke
shops, and balcony lunch rooms
have been campus to students
who have come here from 67 dif-
ferent colleges throughout the
United States. These students re!
ceive a masters degree in retail
training, a degree only Pitt can
confer.

. Part-time Salesmen

Retail training students act ai.
salesmen two days a week, ob-
serve non—selling operations a
third day, and return to Oakland
where they are regular students
the remaining three days a week.

The department points with
pride to its placement bureau

which takes the school’s student's

Fl

   

 

 

  Q

away from their temporary busi-
ness arrangements "in any of the

seven downtown stores and gives

them permanent positions, usually
as supervisors.

You might say retail training
equals good jobs, exciting work,
people, and nice surroundings.

There is one little catch: Like
the busman's proverbial holiday
that includes a ride, the retail
training student is hard at work
behind the counter before Christ-
mas.
