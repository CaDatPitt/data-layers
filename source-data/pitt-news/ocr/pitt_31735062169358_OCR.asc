UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Dr. Lui Will Speak  
On ‘China Crisis Today’

On March 15, the School of
Liberal Arts will hold an Hon-
ors Assembly_followed by a re-
ception for 532 students enrolled

_ in the School of Liberal Arts who

have earned a cumulative quality
point (QPA) of 3.25 or higher.
This group also includes 19 Uni-
versity Scholars who have attain-
ed a cumulative QPA of at least
3.75 with a minimum of 60 cred-
its.

Dr. James T. C. Liu will be the
speaker at the assembly which
will be held in the SU Ballroom
at 3:15 p.m. His topic will be
“The China Crisis Today: An His-
torical Perspective.” Dr. Liu is a
professor of history and Oriental
studies at Princeton University.
Liu was born in Kwe-ichou,Pro-
Vince, China, and did his under-
graduate work at Yenching Uni-
versity. He received his Ph.D. in

history from the University in

1950. Dr. Liu was the coordina-
tor of the University’s Far East-
ern Program. He has written
many books including: Reform in»

_Sung China. and Ouyang Hsiu,

11th Century Neo-Confucainist.

This year there will be no Uni-
versity wide hon-or convocation
as in the past. Instead, each
school is going to hold its own
individual program to recognize
its honors students. ‘

Halfway /Full;
933 Accept

Newly appointed Admissions
Director Bernard J. Kobosky has
announced that 933 high school
seniors have paid a $50 deposit,
reserving a place in next year’s
freshman class. This number rep-

‘resents almost half of the 2,000

freshmen the University expects
to admit by next fall.

Last year at this time only 309 ‘

high school seniors had sent in
-deposits, according to the direc-
tor.

Kobosky stated that his office
had received about 6,500 applica-
tions‘ before last Wednesday's
deadline date. This is an increase
‘of 1,400 over the number re-
ceived by the 1966 deadline of
June 1. Acceptances thus far num-
ber 2,747, and more will be mail-
ed throughout March and April.

Kobosky announced that the

freshman engineering class for

next fall is almost full; only stu-
dents who show exceptional prom-
ise will be chosen from the re-
maining applications.

Impeachment
Campaign

At BU Fails

(CPS) A campaign for the im-
peachment of President Lyndon
Johnson at Boston University two
weeks ago received sharp opposi-
tion last week when 4,000 stu-
dents signed a statement dis-
agreeing with the stand taken by
the student newspaper.

The campaign began when edi-

- tor - in - chief Raymond Mungo

wrote an editorial which was an
“excellent documentation of why
Lyndon Johnson ought to be im-
peached.” Mungo stated that when
he- raised the idea of impeach-
ment before a crowd of 800 stu-
dents, he “got a roaring ovation
out of it.” The editorial was sent

. as a letter to House Speaker John

McCormack. .

Both the local community and
president of the university, Har-
old Case, showed a negative re-

. action, while students. at first

seemed favorable. President Case
told a television station that he
had sent a telegram to McCor-
mack apologizing for the editori-
al and saying that the editors’
opinions do not represent those
of Boston University,
Theirecent statement by 4,000
students also condemned the edi-
torial and maintained that it did-
n’t represent the consensus of

the Boston University student

population.

McCormack’s legislative assis-
tant, Dr. Martin Sweig, said that
the call for impeachment is “ri-
diculous. Who ever heard of such
a thing,” the said.

Mungo said that his- letters-to-
the-editor have been running
three to one against impeach-
ment. “We never even suggest-
ed,” Mungo said, “that we were
speaking for a majority of the
students at BU.-”

Mungo said he was pleased
that students at the university
were reacting to the newspaper.
“What’s important,” he said, “is
that you raise an issue.”

Leader of the delegation was
Agostino Galluzzo, a sophomore
at the School of Public Commun-
ication, who helped to draft and
distribute the statement.

Meanwhile, the campus Young
Democrats Club voted to endorse
impeachment of President John-
son. The university’s YD have
consistently been opposed to the

Johnson Offers Alternatives ,
In Response to Commission A

President J ohns/on in re-
sponse to the report of the
National Advisory _Commis-
sion of the. Selective Service,
(Pitt News, March 6), has
offered an alternate plan of
action concerning the draft
to Congress.

The President’s program, like
that of the National Commission,
calls for the drafting of 19-year-
olds ﬁrst, picking them by lot-
tery. However, the President is
not calling for the abolishment
of student deferments at present.
According to reports, he is post-
poning the decision until further
information can be obtained
through congressional and pub-
lic debate.

Appearing before a special ses-
sion of the House and Senate on
Monday, President Johnson stated
that deferments for graduates, ex-
cept those in medical and dental
schools, will be discontinued. He
emphasized that many post-grad-

Anti-Vietnam

Protest Booth

The University’s Students for
Peace are currently engaged in
is project of collecting money and
signatures from students and fac-
ulty members to place a full page
ad in a local newspaper during
the week of'April 8 when organi-
zations throughout the country
will protest the U.S. involvement
in Vietnam.

Booths will be set up daily in
the Towers Lobby and Cathedral
of Learning ground ﬂoor. In ad-
dition to soliciting signatures and
money, literature on the War in
Vietnam will also be distributed.

According to Ross Danielson,
chairman of the Petition Com-
mittee, “We don’t think this will
result in ending the war, but we
ﬁll it is important to demonstrate
this consensus against the war.”

The group plans on making an
appeal for faculty support to-
night when a newly formed fac-
ulty committee on foreign affairs
meets.

So far, about 250 signatures
and
Other groups from colleges and
universities in this area are in
the process of similar projects,
and they have been meeting reg-
ularly together as the Pittsburgh
Area Students for Peace. The
price for a full page ad in a lo-
cal newspaper is approximately
$2,000.

The text of the peition reads:
“The legality and morality of the
War in Vietnam are not only
high questionable, but a sincere
commitment of our government
to seek a negotiated settlement
seems to us to be absent. Let us
end this useless killing of men,
women, and children and begin

to build a world community

founded on peace. We students
and faculty members from col-
leges, .universities, and high
schools in "the ‘Pittsburgh area

$100 have been received. A

uates “have managed to pile de-
ferment on deferment until they
passed the normal cutoff point
for induction.” Experts believe,
however, that any post-graduate
with a deferment would be per-
mitted to complete his degree.

Although there are many com-
plications involved in" overhaul-
ing the Selectice Service system
(President Johnson has set the
deadline at Jan. 1, 1969), admin-
istration experts contend that
there will be no further marri-
age deferments or deferments for
fatherhood, except in hardship
cases. - '

At the center of the new sys-
tem is what Johnson calls, “a
fair and impartial random sys-
tem of selection.” Those having

deferments would, when their
present. deferment expires, be
placed in the current year’s se-
lection, if under 35, the draftees»
would be selected from these
men. , '7_“-

In adopting the policy of draft- '
ing the “youngest ﬁrst” of those,
without deferments, the Presi-
dent again agrees with the Advi-
sory Committee’s recommenda-
tion.

Johnson concluded his message‘ 
to Congress by stating that the_
establishment of an all—volunteer
Army is unrealistic, and that Vol-_
untary civilian service in the"
Peace Corps or other groups, as."-
a replacement for military serv-_~
ice is “well-meant but imprac-O '
tical.” ' E , :9‘.

Peace Corps Members  
Protest Vietnam Policy

Over 800 returned Peace Corps

volunteers signed a letter on Mon-
day to President Johnson that is
critical of U.S. policy in Viet-
nam as “seriously undermining
hopes for a peaceful and bounti-
ful world.”
' The signers, speaking as indi-
viduals and. not as Peace Corps
representatives, expressed that
“The growing impression that the
the United States is unclear about
its goals in Vietnam and is not
facing realistically the alterna-
tives available to it.”

The letter follows by two
months a letter to the President
from student leaders at 100 col-
leges expressing doubt and an-
xieties about the U.S. War in
Vietnam.

Like the student leaders, the
former Peace Corps volunteers
expressed doubt that some of the
country's “most loyal and coura-
geous young people” would be
willing to serve in the armed
forces in Vietnam.”

“We are, moreover, fearful of
the growing disenchantment and
the resulting loss in enthusiasm
so necessary to the vitality and
effectiveness of _the Peace Corps,”
the letter states.

It also says that creative and
dedicated -people ‘ throughout the
country. would “be reluctant to
participate at all in overseas
programs of the Government—a
state of affairs that would be un-
fortunate for the United States
and tragic for those Americans
who would thus be deprived of
what should be one of the great
experiences of their lives.”

_On the matter of foreign poli-
cy, the letter states its hope for"
a peaceful world and says, “We
are united by those hopes and by
the conviction that American po-
licy is seriously underminingvthe
contribution America can make
tow.ard achieving that kind of
world. ,

“American actions often seem
unconnected to the rhetoric used
to describe what we are doing,”
the letter continues, “a situation
that invites cynicism and suspi-
cion‘ about American rhetoric —-
and goals—-—in places» far removed
from Vietnam itself We have ob-

  
  
   
  
  
   
    

be hampered by such suspicions‘ ,
even in places where these ef-
forts are most constructive.”
At present, there are more
than 10,000 returned Peace Corps
volunteers scattered throughout .-
the nation. =

Burton Segall of New York, a '
member of the ad hoc committee
that collected signatures in this
area, said that no active Peace
Corps workers had been asked to
sign the letter. .

Mr. Segall, who served two;-.
years in Tanzania, said that in-__
clusion of current volunteers“;
“would cloud the issuesince this
letter is not to be construed as
official Peace Corps. policy.” 7.

The chairman of the ad hoc ”
committee is Francis Andrew of
Chicago, a law student at the"
University of Chicago who spent ' j
two years in the Dominican Re-. '- A
public. ’ ‘ ‘ '

Other members,. in addition  _
Mr. Segall, are E. Phillip LeVeeen '1
of Los Angeles, a graduate stu-
dent at the University of Cali!
fornia at Los Angeles; Eric Reu-
ther of Washington, a graduate‘
student at Georgetown Universi-_:l.:_
ty; and Albert C.‘ Ulmer of At'-'
lanta, a community organizer for 5
the Southern Regional Council. 

Mr. LeVeen said some of the"
signers had been upset that the
letter was not in stronger terms.-
“Others,” he said, “didn't want
to sign because they felt the
Peace Corps would suffer eco-N‘
nomically at the hands of an-'
noyed Congressmen.” . O .

project was underway; Universi-
ty students agreed to serve as
group leaders and homes, class-
rooms or offices were arranged.
for use as classrooms.

“In the beginning of the pro-
gram,” said Rosenthal, “the big
job was in interviewing parents
and students, ﬁnding out what
the needs were. Diversiﬁed groups
were formed of people not likely
to get together, one part of the
enrichment project.

After working nearly 40 hours

‘a week last summer in organiz-

ing the project, Rosenthal now
puts in 25 hours per week in
helping leaders provide a “ger-
minative” approach to learning.
No facts are taught the students,
instead they are encouraged to do
critical thinking.

“We are not trying to produce
non-conﬁrmists,” said Rosenthal,
“but we want them to do radical
and imaginative thinking. We try
to stimulate their creativity by‘
contact with good art and litera-
ture, and by encouraging them to
write their own plays, music, poe-
try. We try to encourage their
sense of self-awareness and try

to get them to do things for
themselves.

All the groups, which are small
and focused on individual atten-
tion, meet on a ﬂexible schedule.
Those singled out for “intensive
work,” who can beneﬁt most
from the program, may meet two
or three times a week.

Rosenthal recently made an
evaluation of the children’s prog-
ress in the program. Two things
were obvious. Project Challenge
students,. due to encouragement,
were usually freer with strangers,
interested in learning what they
could offer. In addition, their di-
versiﬁcation of interests were
quite high. ‘

Rosenthal is now interested in’
expanding his program in the 7

near future to include more
bright underprivileged children.
He also looks forward to work-
ing in cooperation with the Learn-
ing Research and Development
Center and other groups in the
community.

Miriam Abrams, a ten-year-old
East End Elementary School stu-
dent, explained that she thought
the program was “just great.” We
get to talk about psychology,”
said Miriam, “and we even dis-
cussed why we hurt others. It’s
a good chance to ﬁnd out about
ourselves.” -

Rosenthal, through his project,
is trying to see what can be done
to develop the gifted individual
into the genius. For this reason
he feels the project should be of
interest to everyone’ in the aca-

demic community. He encourages '

those interested to call the YMCA
office.

‘Friday,’ March 3, issue of The
Pitt News, concerning so-called
.*‘unannounced” "ex-a minga ti o n s

given by this Department,, we
~~would like to present the other
side of the issue. We believe that
the letter was written in refer-
ence to an examination given in
, our Geography’ 81 class.
. One of the major issues_is what
constitutles an “unannounced”

‘examination in the course, stu-
dents were told that the next
test would not be announced,
since it would follow the next
unit of work. Prior to the “un-
Z\fanounced” test, both Mr. Muel-

ndicated in their recitation‘sec-
‘_t2on_s the week before the exam-
ination was given that a distinct
" nit of the course (the litho-
fsphere) had been completed, and
that an examination could-be ex-
pected in the near future. Fur-
thermore, a much more emphatic

As a member of the Liberal

necessary to reply to to Dr. To-

ing this program.

Although I respect Dr. Tobias’
concern for the quality of his
courses, his fear that the Pass-
Fail proposal is the “ﬁnal blow"
to upperclass distribution course
is totally unjustiﬁed: our propos-
al speciﬁcally statesithat no dis‘-

Pass-Fail option. _

Secondly, the criticism that the

ed on the bandwagon” is also
unwarranted. The merits of this

program have been under study
since September; over 20 faculty
members — the majority of them
department chairmen——were ask-
ed to comment upon the propos-
al in its earliest stages; the pro-
gram was revised many times be-
fore being submitted in January

to the Faculty Assembly, with the ‘

faculty comments taken into con-
sideration. Rather than a “ba1nd-
wagon” measure, the Pass-Fail
program was a carefully written
proposal, intended to-broaden a

student’s academic’ career. I do_
not feel that this program will .

“cheapen”_ a student’s degree.

As a ﬁnal precaution in ad-
ministering this program, it was
strongly ‘urged that a student’s
academic advisor play an impor-
tant role in the student’s selec-
tion of courses to be taken on a
pass-fail basis. Field courses in
an unrelated division to the stu-
dent’s major or minor are rec-
ommended ‘areas to be studied
on this basis. If the advisor feels

that the "student could do well in -

a course, it should not be taken
as a pass-fail grade.

It is encouraging that Dr. To-
bias has taken the time to be
concerned about the Liberal Arts
Cabinet; we welcome any other
faculty or student interest. The
Pass-Fail program will no doubt
be reviewed next year, when the
results of the fall trimester will
be available. Perhaps further cri-
ticism should be saved for that
time. I

Student Suggests

Correspondence

Editor, The Pitt News:

Recently I wrote to the USO
Office here in Pittsburgh request-
ing a list of servicemen’s ad-
dresses in -Vietnam. Since there
is deﬁnitely a morale problem, I
though corresponding with some
of the fellas ﬁghting there might
help. In reply, I received a letter
from Lynn Baehr, USO director,
asking that the following letter
might be published in The Pitt
"News, in hopes that some of my
fellow students, both men and
women, might respond.

I think that those of us who
have brothers, ﬁnances or friends
ﬁghting in Vietnam can appreci-
ate what letters from home mean
to these men and those who don’t
know anyone ﬁghting there will
have a greater awareness of this
situation by corresponding with
a serviceman. Something like
this would make a great and
worthwhile sorority project.

Thank you for your attention‘
to this matter.

Boys Question
Morning Ritual

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reply to a question present-
ed in a letter published Mon-
clay,,“Is Pitt turning into the fag
capitol of Western Pennsylvania?”

for two years while he was_in the armed forces.

V If the President and Congress insist that college students be drafted
then they should serve before they even begin their work for their bache-
lor's degree. Any‘ break in the higher education process would be inevit-
ably harmful. Finally, !we must object to the President’s intimation that
the student who goes on for advanced degrees is somehow an unpatriotic
individual who wishes to a.void his duties as a citizen of the United States.

The President has said that hewill not decide whether undergraduates
should be allowed, to have deferments ‘until he has heard the Congressional
and public debate on the subject. We hope members of the University
community would see -it as their duty to express’ their opinion and hope-
fully state their disgust with the proposals the President" has set forth.

HIlllI ﬂ

First,, I would like to express
my surprise at the writer’s na-
ivete. Does he really thing that
use of men's cosmetics is a sign,
of man’s lack of masculinity? The
realtest of masculinity (assum-
-ing that masculinity and hetero-
sexuality are synonymous) is
sexual performance with a Wom-
an. Does Mr. Tierney, the writer
of the letter to which I am re-
plying, assume a positive corre-
lation between use of cosmetics
and inability to “make it” physi-
cally and emotionally with wom-
en? I would like to see the data
substantiating an assumption
like that. More important, how-'
ever, if a man wants to use 10-
tions, oils, talcum, etc. on his
body, that is entirely up to him,
no matter what it implies about
his personality. b

Concerning whether or not Pitt
is becoming a fag capitol (quite
‘a sophisticated choice of words_

’ for a graduate student, I might

add!), I have never given the
question much thought. But if
most ’ of Pitt’s male residents
would rather “-spend an hour in

a Tower B commode on a week- *

day morning” watching men,
primp in front of a mirror, in-
stead of getting a little extra
sleep (and Mr. Tierney in his let-
ter encourages men to do pre-
clsely the former), then maybe
the answer is yes. However, I
think most of us prefer sleeping
to peeping!

Apartheid Policy
Spells Separation

Editor, The Pitt News:

What would you do if you sud-
denly found the CIA had set up
an interrogation and student con-
trol agency on campus? What
would you say if you found it
necessary to have a government
pass to travel from one state to
another? What would your reac-
tion be if you found you were
restricted to attend a Polish, J ew-
ish, Italian, Irish, Chinese, or
Negro college? How would you
feel if student congregation, dis-
cussion, and speech were forbid-
den? .

Impossible you say? Not if you
live in South Africa. Due to the
apartheid policy, students are di-
vided according to race, and are
then forced to attend tribal col-
leges in the underdeveloped areas
where they were born. The Gov-
ernment’s policy is directed to-
ward creating continuous divi-
sion and suspicion among the
various factions of the South Af-
rican native population.

To further control the liberal,
free thinking college population,_
the government maintains a Ges-
tapo like police agency on each
campus. The students are not al-
lowed to discuss political policies.
They are forbidden to travel any-
where, including other universi-
ties, without a government issued
pass.

Any infraction of these regula-
tions precipitates a midnight visit
and police interrogation. The stu-

dent may be expelled from the.

university, and there is nowhere
he can go to have this decision
reviewed. '

You, the university students of
the United States, have the right
of free speech, of congregation,
and of expression on your cams
puses, but you take it for granted.
Students in universities around
the world look to you for sup-
port and leadership as free,
young, and dynamic students. '

There is a lack of purpose and
direction among the students in
America. How many of you are
in college because you thirst for
knowledge and know your coun-
try will need educated, informed,
and responsible leaders. This 'is
the reason the South African
black man wants to .go to school.
He is restricted, segregated, ham-
pered and suppressed. You are
encouraged, aided, and advised
during your college careers.

Are you really all talk and no
activity? Will you continue to in-
dulge in purposeless activity?
You had better think about it or
one day you will wake up and
find the rights you take for
granted exist no more.

These comments were summar-
ized from interviews and discus-
sions with a student from the
University of Natal, Republic of
South Africa, during his visit on
campus last week. As a represen-
tative of the World University
Service, his purpose was to ap-
peal to the student body to sup-

‘port the upcoming WUs schol.

‘Another _

Bill DelVecchio S Still

Running in Blue, Gold

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

IIIIIIII lIIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIINUIIII
|IIIIIllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIllll|I||I||Il|Ii'Il|II|Il| lI||

Bill DelVecchio is running for his life, There has been
no limit placed on his future by some doctor. Nor has he
been running away from his past_ Rather, he has been run-

‘ning toward the future——the upcoming Olympic games.

His varsity career ended nearly two years ago, but he
still wears his Pitt sweat suit. He was one of the greatest
runners to ever put on a Pitt uniform, but he has learned
more about running in the short time since
he graduated than he did during the four
years he was on the track team.

He continues to pound out mile after
mile on those sagging boards in the Field
House after putting in a full day at the Den-
 tal School. He continues to strain every mus-
” cle in his body while lunging out of the

 

  starting block because he has a vision.
“I think I have just as good a chance
to make it to the Olympics as anybody else,” he will conﬁde.

And he continues to work and strain. For DelVecchio,
running is part of his life_ The starting gun. The ﬁnishing
tape. Both are as much a part of his body as blood and cells.

“I enjoy it. Nobody likes to go up there and beat the
hell out of himself. Once I stop thinking that it’s fun, then
it will be time to quit.” ‘ -.

This winter he has entered the biggest amateur meets
in the East. In the Philadelphia Inquirer indoor meet, he
placed ﬁrst in the 600. Right now he can run about a 46
ﬂat in the quarter and the 220 is still his best race.

Every place he goes, he still warms up in his Pitt uni-
form,

“And everybody asks me‘ what has happened to Pitt.”

The track team has been humiliated in nearly every
dual meet it has entered this winter. There are maybe six.
good runners and an outstanding coach but not much else.

“They have to make up their minds about what type
of track program they want,” ‘says DelVecchio. “Right
now they can’t compete on the dual level_ that they have
been.

“Either they should give out enough scholarships to
ﬁeld a team with depth or else they should eliminate dual
meet competition. The only way Pitt is going to make a
name for itself again is to give out six full scholarships
and concentrate on these six boys. By entering them in the
big invitational meets and with Banner as a coach, people
will start to notice Pitt runners again.”

According to DelVecchio, the one thing Pitt has going
for it now is a good coach_ Inthe past, it didn’t even have
that. I

“This is the ﬁrst year that the track team has been
taught how to run. Last year,.Paul Greig was told that he
could never be a really good runner. This year he has broken
the two mile record which should have been broken a long
time ago.

“Frank Handelman, Kigman Davis and Greig still
haven’t reached their full potential. They’re like sopho-
mores now because they didn’t learn how to run a race
until this year.” .

From experience, DelVecchio realizes that the only
way to gain that experience is to run in the big meets. But
that takes money.

DelVecchio gained his experience on his own, He never
would have done as well as he has if Jim Banner hadn’t
been around, but while Bill was on the varsity, Banner‘
wasn’t around that often. ‘

DelVecchio still wears the Pitt name mainly for Ban-
ner’s sake. He still continues to labor in solitude because

that solitude is part of his life. And he still harbors the ‘

hope that sometime in the future Pitt will make up its
mind about what type of track program it wants,

Comeback

1‘.-_~'

Pushed Aside ’Til Next Year 3

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
. Assistant Sports Editor

It was supposed to have
been the start of a comeback
for Panther basketball. This

was to be the year, everyone was
saying, when the team would use
its depth, its sophomore talent
to end the devastating drought
of the past two seasons.

But for some reasons that are
clear, and for others that aren’t
so obvious, the Panthers didn’t
improve. Instead, they regressed.
Bluntly, they had their worst
year in history.

The cagers lost’ 19 games, and
won only six. Two of the Wins
were over Carnegie Tech. The
other four games that could be
chalked up as victories were

against Westminster, Bucknell,
Lafayette, and Air Force.

Of the six wins, the biggest
margin of victory was 14 points.
On the other side, the Panthers
lost to‘Penn State by 40, and to
Davidson, Cornell, and Temple
by 38.

Coach Bob Timmons had hoped
to break even this year. He cited
several problems which explain-
ed why his team didn’t.

“First off, we lost Dave Welty
to baseball,” he pointed out. “We
had been counting on him to run
our offense. Then we missed
S1 eve Stevenson and Tim Fisher
for the ﬁrst part of the year.
When Stevenson came back, it
took him a while to get into the
'rl.*.ythm of the club. We lost Fish-
er permanently, and he’d been

Winning Season Ends
As Cubs Beat Point Park

by MIKE BROURMAN
It was a big night for the steak eaters on the frosh

basketball team. Coach Tim Grgurich awards a beef dinner
to every ballplayer who grabs 15 rebounds, and three of the
Cubs picked off that number in Monday night’s 83-76 victory

over Point Park,

Paul Naponick, Rob McFarland
and Mike Patcher were the win-
ners, and it isn’t the ﬁrst time
for any of them. In fact they
should be eating steak for quite
a while.

Patcher is credited with ﬁve
dinners, McFarland and Naponick
have three apiece, as does Charlie
Hunt, who missed out last night.

It took the strong rebounding
to down Point Park, which gave
the Cubs almost as much trouble
this time as they did in the ear-
lier meeting at the Field House.
Then it took a second rally and
an overtime for an 82-77 victory.

It took 30 minutes in this game
for the Cubs to establish them-
selves. At one point in the ﬁrst
half they lead by 14, 31-17, but
Lee Snyder led a rally which cut
it to 38-36 at the half.

Midway through the second per-
iocl the frosh still led by only a
bucket. Then McFarland and
Patcher led a charge which car-
ried the Cubs to an 18 point edge,
at 78-60, and enable Grgurich to
empty his bench. Point Park
whittled away at the margin,

 

but the outcome was never in
doubt. ,

The win gives the frosh a ﬁnal
record of 14-4 for the year. This
ties them with the 1966 club
which included Julius Peg and
Charlie Hirsch, three year start-
ers .on team which went to two
NCAA tourneys.

Still Grgurich was not com-
pletely satisﬁed. “I thought we’d
be undefeated,” he admitted.

.Varsity coach Bob Timmons is
more realistic. “They played a
pretty good ballclub tonight and
won. Snyder is an older boy and
whenever you’re playing juniors
or kids with more experience it
makes a difference. They did a
good job considering.”

McFarland led the Cubs with
23 points, Patcher added 22 and
Bob Petrini scored 13. Hunt, Nap-
onick and Dick Hassinger each
had eight. Snyder, operating out
of the pivot, led all scorers with
33 points, including 13 of 13 from
the foul line. Ron Brown added
13,’ mostly on long jumpers and
sweeping hooks.

counted on for offensive punch.

“Those were three of our best
sophomores right there,” he em-
phasized. “Then, of course, Stan
Falenski was out for eight games.
You can’t play basketball that

way. You have to get ﬁve men

playing together.”

Timmons had mixed appraisals
of the remaining three sopho-
mores oif of last year's 11-5
freshman team. “Len Kalata help-
ed us, as did Stevenson when he
came back,” he noted. “Tony De-
Lisio ﬁnally decided he wanted
to play basketball, and he start-
ed working on his defense to-
wards the end of the season. Al
.DiFrischia has to build up his
strength and become more ag-
gressive to be eﬂ:'ective.”

The year hasn’t been wasted
for those four sophs. They had a
chance to get experience play-
ing against some top .ballc1ubs.
Six Panther opponents have re-

ceived bids to post season tourna- 
nients.

“Our kids got around and saw
sophomores on other teams,” said
Timmons. “They realize now
what they should be like.”

Next year, Timmons will be
able to mix that experience with
two—year lettermen Ken Bclens
and Pete Smith, and with this
season’s freshman crop. The Pan-
thers lose Jim LaValley, top
scorer and leading rebounder,
Bob Caldwell, and Falenski
through graduation. LaValley’s
spot will be the most crucial to
ﬁll.

“Jim just this year came
around,” observed Timmons. “But
Charley Hunt is ahead of LaVal-
ley at this stage in his career.
All we have to do is teach him
to put the ball in the basket. He
has that annoying habit of miss-
ing the easy ones.”

Timmons is_conﬁdent that Hunt
will concentrate on basketball
over the summer. “They do that
in Indiana,” he said. Summer-
time appears to be the key to
next year's chances.

“Basketball is a sport where
you either improve or go back,
you never stay the same,” Tim-
mons reﬂected. “The boys are go-
ing to have to work individually
cn shooting, ballhandling, and
footwork.”

It’s too early to get hopes up
for a winning season, especially
after this year's letdown. Pray
for a long summer instead.

 Gymnasts End Season on Sour

by ANDY SWARTZ
The gymnastics season is
ﬁnally over. Like the foot-
ball team, like the basketball
team, and like the Wrestling_
team it Was their worse sea-

son in history. The gymnasts
lost to all seven of their Eastern
league opponents and compiled
a 2-9 record, defeating only Cor-
nell and West Virginia.

The decisivevpfactor behind the
failure was the lack of partici-
pants. Throughout the season the
gymnasts had between ﬁve-and-
seven men competing against
their opposition’s 15-20. Due to
injuries they were never really
at full strength.

At the beginning of the year
Dave Shidemantle was injured.
His injury, combined with several
players not returning from last
year’s squad, forced coach War-
ren Neiger to press the remain-
ing six gymnasts into new events.

Jim Sacco was originally hop-
ing to concentrate on three events
and leave the all-around division
to lg Perez. However with only
seven members on the team it be-
came a must for everyone to par-
ticipate in several events.

Coach Neiger remarked, “I
really though that we could match
or even improve last season’s 4-7
record.” However, the morale of

the team suffered and. it soon be-

ICAAAA  

Meet Completes Indoor
Trackster Competition

by DAN LICHTENSTEIN

The indoor track season ended Saturday night in much
the same way it began: frustrating, but with pretty much
what was expected. Four runners returned from the ICA
competition in Madison Square Galrdenwith good times and
good performances but with no score. A ,

Well over 100 athletes completed in this Eastern indoor

championship meet, so the events
had to be run in numerous quali-

- fying heats before the ﬁnal cham-

pionship ﬁelds were determined.
All four runners, Frank Handel-
man, Paul Greig, Kingman Davis
and Chet Wojceikowski ﬁnished
high in their individual heats in
times consistent with their usual
performances. But these times
were not good enough to place’
them in the ﬁnals.‘

For instance, Kingman Davis
won his own heat in the 600-yard
run. But there were 14 of these
qualifying heats and only the top
ﬁve of six times from all 14 made
it to the ﬁnals. No one can say
how well Davis would have done
had he been in a faster qualifying
race.

The story is the same for the-
others. Handelman has bettered
the old 1,000-yard record several
times this season with 2:13 to
2:15 clockings. However, this time
and a second place in his heat

Misfits, MBA  
Undefeated
Independents

The Independent Intramural
Basketball League has ended with
two undisputed winners.

In League “A,” the Misﬁts ﬁn-

ished the season undefeated in _

eight games. Their magic formu-

‘ la was a balanced attack. Each

game, three or four players scored
in the double ﬁgures. Captain Al
Zortea and Jim Jaﬁe (high ,
scorer) were the most consistent
gunners for the champs.

The Misﬁts beat the runner-up
Young Bulls (7-1), 48-45, in a
head on clash that decided the
top spot. Freshman football play- ,

y <:i's Frank,Gustine, George Med-

ich, and Chuck Winters were the’
heart of the Young Bull attack.

In League “B,” the MBA ﬁn-
ished the season undefeated at '
8-0. Their formula was high
scorer Tom Roantree who aver.
aged better than 25 points per
game. Captain Bob Schultz, sec-
ond high scorer, kept the defense
honest with"his consistent scor-
1118‘.

A  Nads~-ﬁnished strong end‘

did not place him in the cham-
pionship race.

Greig, too, has been consistent
in running about 9:17 for two

' miles. Although this has been one

of the better times in the East
for the season, it was too far
from the very best. Greig ﬁnished
second in his heat, but did not
ﬁgure in the championship.

Wojceikowski made the best
showing. Running his usual 6.3 to
6.4 for the 60-yard dash, he
made it through the qualifying
and quarter ﬁnal heats. Yet this.
time wasn’t good enough to get
him past the semi-ﬁnals.

Although not one of the four
was signiﬁcant in the overall
meet, coach Jim Banner was
pleased with their individual per-
formances. One bright note is
that he has next year to look for-
ward to. Only Handelman will be
lost through graduation and Da-
vis is only a sophomore.

But next March is too far away
to consider, for the outdoor sea-
son begins in three weeks. April
1 marks the ﬁrst outside d.ua1
meet which will be at Navy.

  

 
 
     

ompetition:-.3‘  ,

 

came apparent that the gymnasts
just didn’t have the manpower
nor the skill of their opposition.
The outlook for next season is
even worse. With the graduation
of captains Ig Perez and Jim Sac-
co and only one promising fresh-
man, Denny Ricard, it is likely
that the gymnasts will be lucky
to match this year’s record.
However, coach Neiger has

traveled all over the East in

search of talent for next year’s
freshman team which‘ he hopes to
form for the ﬁrst time in four
years. Neiger hopes to recruit at
least eight gymnasts and hope-
fully have some other boys come

__out on their own.

Note

' Since some of the best gym-
nasts in the east come out of
three local high schools, Penn
Hills, Butler, and Mt. Lebanon,
Neiger is attempting to attract
some local talent. “Next year
there will deﬁnitely be a compet-
ing freshman team which will
give the boys some badly needed
experience.

Neiger admitted the results of
his recruiting program will not
show for at least two years. The
record of next year’s gymnastic
squad will heavily count on Dave
Shidemantle. If Shidemantle stays
healthy the gymnasts could pos-
sibly win several meets. Without
him, they may not win any.

WOMEN'S CHORAL
PAUL D. ANDERSON, Director

To ALL UNIVERSITY WOMEN:

You are cordially invited to atten dan informal team on
Friday afternoon, March 10th, from 2:30 until 4:00 o’clock
in Dining Room ‘A’ of Schenley Hall, at which time you

may apply for membership in the 1967-68 Women’s Choral.

‘We are university women who love music and love to
sing. Our members are an industrious crew, and we are
proud that many of, them are elected to honorary organiza-‘
tions on the campiis. We believe in our group because it is
one activity which is not only fun and entertaining, but is
also worthwhile and educationally sound. We are delighted
that freshmen have always added new enthusiasm to our
singing. Our music includes pieces from the Middle Ages
right up to “the very latest,” and we love it all!

In past years, our concerts have been given jointly with
a.men’s glee club, either at ‘Pitt’ or some other university.

In order to reinstate these, we plan to invite to membership
.-sixty women now, and twenty more this summer. If ‘suc-
cessful,’ and with your active assistance there is no reason
why we should not be, one of the ﬁrst activities in the fall,

' following Lantern" Night, will be a. weekend “Choral Camp,”

where we and the “Pitt” Glee Club can get a good start on
the year’s music. " -
