Piﬂ drops lwo men's sporis Faculty

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Beginning in the 1996-97 acad-
emic year, women’s soccer will
be introduced as the newest varsi-
ty sport at the University of
Pittsburgh. Next year, the men’s
gymnastics and men’s tennis pro-
grams will be eliminated.

‘The elimination of two men’s
sports has been an agonizing deci-
sion,” Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes said in a published report
on May 2. “It is a decision we
deeply regret, especially for the
coaches and athletes currently in
our men’s tennis and gymnastics
programs.”

According to Title IX, which
was enacted in 1972, any educa-
tional institution receiving federal

funding must provide equal‘

opportunities to both men and
women, to participate in all activi-
ties, including athletics.

There are different ways in
which schools can comply with
Title IX.

For example, it can show a his-
tory of expanding the opportuni-
ties for women to become
involved in athletics. It can also
fully accommodate the needs of
women students.

Or, the university can ensure
that the number of women partici-
pating is proportional to the num-
ber of women in the student body.
This can be achieved by the addi-
tion of women’s teams, cutting of
men’s teams or use a combination
of both. Pitt chose the latter.

\V1th the reduction of the two
men’s teams, there will be nine
men’s programs and eight

women’s programs for the 1995-
96 academic year. In 1996-97
there will be nine apiece, after the
addition of women’s soccer.

Jaynes said that the most severe
punishment from failing to com-
ply with Title IX would be the
government to withold federal
funds, which are numbered in the
millions. Also, other forms of
financial aid, such as PELL
Grants, would be witheld.

The Office of Civil Rights
selects schools on a random basis,
or after a complaint is filed.
Jaynes said that no complaint was
ﬁled and the OCR investigation
probably arrived from there previ-
ously being ll men’s teams and
only eight women’s teams.

Jaynes said that there was a sur-
vey conducted on campus by the

Pitt faculty members will
have a stronger voice if they
unionize, say leaders of the
‘United Faculty (UF), but oth-
ers say negotiation by collec-

priate for assembly line work-

than for faculty in a diverse
university setting.

“We each approach our jobs

require homogeneity rather
than heterogeneity and they
tend to attack these diverse
points of view.”

“University faculty are not
laborers working on an
assembly line putting cars
together,” said Paul Shepard,
a physics professor.

Because university faculty
have to make many more
decisions and have such dif-
fering opinions, the collective
bargaining used by unions to
negotiate salary, benefits and
working conditions would be
inappropriate, according to
Shepard.

But approximately 25 per-

around the United States
engage in collective bargain-
ing through unions. And on a

Finals week just ended and grades only
came but a few days ago and already you are
backin the classroom. For some students,
this so-called “summer break” is actually no
break at all.

“I think it’s a lot more stressful in the sum-
mer,” said senior Kim Noonan, who is
majoring in microbiology. “The pace is
much faster. You only have seven weeks of
class.”

Kim has taken summer classes before and
says she does not think it is harder to study
or that the professors are more lenient during
the summer.“You really have to work a lot
faster,” she said.

According to Ken Service, director of
communications, summer class enrollment is
on the decline. In 1991, 14,011 students
were enrolled in summer classes. By last

However, not all students think taking
classes in the summer is stressful.

Bob Silvio, a Pitt sophomore, is taking
summer classes because he is co-oping for
engineering. He says that he has not found it
difficult to concentrate in class yet because
the hot weather is not here yet.

_“I think it’s a little more relaxed in the
summer because the professors seem to have
the same attitudes as the students,” said
Silvio. “They understand it’s harder for us
because of the nice weather.”

Some students think that the nice weather
outside actually makes it easier on them dur-
ing the semester.

.“There’s definitely a big difference,” said
Robert Berry, a junior majoring in exercise
physiology. “It’s a lot more relaxed.”

“There’s not as many students and the pro-
fessors have more free time,” he said. ,“Last
year, if you had 15 to 20 people in a class,

. Summer means back to school for some

year it had dropped to 12,595.

that was a lot.” ,

He says he has to take summer classes in
order to keep his grades up because he
works full-time. “I can only take about three
classes a semester.”

Pitt junior Joe Direnzo also thinks the nice
weather makes attending class easier.

“They’re pretty laid—back,” he said. “I kind
of get the impression that a lot of the instruc-
tors really don’t want to be there, and the
students are able to see that.”

He says he takes summer classes because
he has a double major and wants to graduate
on time. He says he does not find it hard to
concentrate since most of his classes end
pretty early in the day.“I’d only sleep in in
the mornings if I didn’t have class.”

So, even if you are taking summer classes
just to keep yourself busy, try to keep the
sound of people rollerblading and the sight
of frisbees ﬂying past from making your
thoughts drift right out the window.

much higher, said Mark
Ginsburg, president of UP.

Leaders of UF launched
their campaign to unionize
faculty members on April 26
when they held a press confer-
ence urging eligible faculty
members to sign cards autho-
rizing UF to represent faculty
in collective bargaining.

The UF leaders said a union
can strengthen faculty voice at
Pitt without ignoring the uni-
versity’s diversity.

Although unionization has
been an ongoing considera-
tion, the recent decision by
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor to change health
insurance carriers in spite of
faculty opposition emphasized
the need for faculty to have a
more effective mechanism to
negotiate such concerns,
according to Philip Wion, trea-
surer and past president of UF.

“The decision on
HealthAmerica and the way it
was done certainly offended an
awful lot of faculty and staff
and brought home as never
before the need for unioniza-
tion so that such decisions
could be negotiated instead of
handed down,” Wion said.

But the current governance
bodies at Pitt, such as the
Senate Council and the
University Planning and
Budgeting Committee
(UPBC), already involve staff,
faculty and students in deci-
sion-making processes, said
Ken Service, director of com-
munications.

Various committees were set
up through the University
Senate to examine the health
insurance issue, said Pratt, and
although the recommendation

to keep Blue Cross/Blue
Shield as the health insurance
carrier was not followed, that
is not a justification to form a
union.

Pratt voiced his opinion
against the change in health-
care carriers and even though
he does not agree with
O’Connor’s ultimate decision,
he said he believes the chan-
cellor took all points of view
into account.

“If people want the opportu-
nity to make recommenda-

as salary, benefits and working
conditions, Ginsburg said. The
current governance groups
would still operate to discuss
academic priorities, building
and other development pro-
grams within the university,
Ginsburg said.

While administrators say
that adding a faculty union to
the current governance bodies
would only increase bureau-
cratization at Pitt, Ginsburg
says the faculty union would
allow “the governance systems

the union and administration

Ginsburg said, relations

been very positive despite a

But a faculty union would
prevent Pitt’s Board of
Trustees and top administra-
tors from unilaterally making a
change, such as was made
after the health-care debate.

Under collective bargaining,
the only way a change could
be made would be if two sides
reached an agreement after
negotiations or if an agreement
could be reached under negoti-
ations mediated by the state
labor board.

“In the end, the agreement
has to be reached and not have
people walking away from the
table and saying, ‘Well, that’s
your argument and this is mine
and we’re going to impose
something’,” Ginsburg said.

tiations would not cover areas

on matters that weren’t includ-

could be even more effective.”

At other campuses where
faculty and administration
engage in collective bargain-
ing, the union and governance
groups have developed a com-
plementary relationship, giv-
ing‘ the faculty a more
assertive voice, Wion said.

“When the faculty becomes
organized, those governance
systems can be strengthened,”
Ginsburg said.

However, a complementary
and professional relationship
already exists between the
administration and faculty
governance groups, and a
union may disturb that,
Service said.

That’s a misperception, said

also remain commit-
ted to reﬂecting the diversity
of the campus, Wion said.
People who know how collec-
tive bargaining has worked
across the country notice that
contracts are tailored to the
specific needs of campuses, he
said. _
Any contract “would reﬂect
the diversity and variety of
faculty wishes,” Wion said.
“Out of an institution as com-
plex as Pitt, it would not be
appropriate to ignore diversi-
ty.”
“There’s no reason to
believe that because you have
a union you only have one
voice,” Ginsburg said. “What
you have is a mechanism for
encouraging discussion and
debate and making sure that
when there is consensus that
you have a strong legally bind-

The UF has sent authoriza-
tion cards to all eligible faculty
and to many eligible part-time
faculty. According to
Ginsburg, faculty members at
all five campuses are eligible
to sign authorization cards
except for those in the medical
school, a group of part-time
faculty in the law school and
faculty members who also
hold an administrative posi-
tion, such as department chair,
associate dean or provost.

'State law requires that 30
percent of these cards indicate
approval for a faculty union in
order to authorize an election,
but UF leaders will not limit

themselves to that percentage-

They will look for an indica-
tion that the majority of the
faculty would support union-
ization before petitioning the
state labor relations board to
hold an election, Ginsburg
said.

UF leaders said they hope an
election will be held prior to
the search for the new chancel-
lor so that the he or she would
not come into an uncertain sit-
uation.

UF needs to hear colleague
concerns about unionization in
order to address those'ques—
tions, Ginsburg said.

“If the vast majority of fac-
ulty know the details — the
clear picture — they will sup-
port this move to organize,” he
said.

Some faculty members
remain unconvinced.

“I don’t think the faculty
union is going to improve the
quality of the faculty or the
quality of education at the

Jaynes said that to remain in

football team and both men’s and

mum requirement to remain in

“Every sport came under
scrutiny,” said J aynes.

Due to the financial strains of
the University, it would be
impossible for Pitt to just add
three women’s sports to even the
number. Thus, it was imperative
that some men’s sports be
dropped.

edge of it, but [Jaynes] did

Dieffenbach also coaches
women’s tennis and manages the
Charles L. Cost Sports Center.
He will retain these positions
next year.

“I’ll still give 110 percent to
the program,” he said.

The men’s tennis team had
been in existence for the last 80
years and they didn’t have a los-
ing record in the last 12 years.

Dieffenbach, who had coached
the men’s team since 1975, com-
piled a 190-151 during this time.

“Unfortunately for the men,
the team had to be eliminated,”
Dieffenbach said. “The team has
always done well academically,
their QPAs have always been

The progress of the men’s ten-
nis team has been hindered by
the lack of outdoor tennis courts.

Title IX Causes Racket

In attempting to comply with NCAA Title IX regulations,
the Pitt athletic department has announced it will drop the
men’s gymnastics and tennis teams in order to field a
women’s soccer team. This recent decision has sparked a lot
of controversy.

According to The Daily Pennsylvanian (the newspaper of
the University of Pennsylvania), Title IX of NCAA regula-
tions requires that “any educational institution receiving fed-
eral funding provide equal opportunities to participate in all
activities, including athletics, to both males and females.” It
is unquestionable that the concept behind this regulation is
valid, even necessary at times. For years, collegiate athletics
was dominated solely by male athletes, merely because the
opportunity did not exist for women to enter the collegiate
arena. Title IX is aimed at providing that arena.

The issues presented by Pitt’s recent decision, however,
focus around much more than simply gender inequities. The
decision to drop the men’s programs came only recently, at
the end of the spring term, leaving members of those teams
with few options if they want to pursue _athletics at another
college or university. .

By the time the decision was announced, athletes stood lit-
tle chance of winning scholarships to play anywhere else.
Those athletes who are here on scholarships will be allowed
to keep them until they graduate, but if they choose to trans-
fer in order to play, they will most likely be unable to win a
scholarship at another school until the fall of 1996.

Economics is certainly not an area which can be ignored in
this issue. In order to fund the budget the women’s soccer
team will require, something had to go. To avoid a violation
of Title IX, Pitt’s decision to cut the men’s teams was the
only possible avenue.

Pitt’s athletic department is not to be faulted for the deci-
sion; the NCAA set the rules, and Pitt merely followed
them..Women’s soccer is quickly gaining popularity
throughout the country, and Pitt is finally acknowledging not
only that fact, but the need to offer more opportunities for
female athletes. I

The Pitt News supports the decision to add women’s soccer
to the athletic department. This decision is a great step
toward the greater goal of providing equal opportunities to
both men and women, in and out of the athletic arena. It is
unjustifiable to assert the “men are better athletes than
women anyway” argument, because that does not solve any-
thing and it is not even necessarily true. However, we sym-
pathize with those men who are being punished in order to
facilitate that step.

Pitt’s decision might have been made with a bit more con-
cern shown toward those who have already achieved some-
thing, while at the same time opening opportunities for oth-
ers to achieve the same.

Reverse racism equally wrong

n _ the last
few years,
the black

‘community has
participated in
all kinds of
social activity,

  

olunmist

ranging from
Rick a n t 1 - d r u g
Nowlin marches and

workshops to
“Stop the Violence!” rallies,
not to mention all the never-
ending battles against racism.

While such are important, I
don’t think any of these touch
its biggest problem — its
inability or unwillingness to
forgive. Holding on to resent-
ment and bitterness and refus-
ing to deal with them in a
healthy manner causes all sorts
of problems, such as depres-
sion, rage and chemical depen-
dency.

So, just what is forgiveness?
The best way I can put it is a
cancellation of an emotional or
social debt; its ultimate mes-
sage is: “Yes, you were wrong,
but I won’t hold it against
you.” It is NOT merely forget-
ting about a misdeed or deny-
ing its harmful effects —- these
must always be taken into
account. Rather, the evil deed
is removed as a barrier to any
relationship.

This is especially important
when dealing with the unpleas-
ant and controversial subject
of racism, which, contrary to
popular opinion, is primarily a
relational, not institutional,
problem. I would be lying if I
told you I haven’t suffered
racism (although fellow blacks
who have read my past
columns on the subject would
question that); however, I’ve
been able to withstand its
effects on me by doing some-
thing novel.

In 1973, I made the decision
to forgive, in advance, the
entire white race.

Two years earlier, I had
entered what is now known as
Trinity Christian School, as
one of the few blacks and the
only black male in my fifth-
grade class, and l simultane-

ously attended its white, con-
servative “mother” church. I

was being taught at home that V
‘ all whites hated me — and I

was, unfortunately, very vocal
about it.

But my attitude began to
shiftwhen I ran across a cou-
ple of Sunday School lessons
which gave the impression that
racism was indeed a bad thing.
(Remember, this was long
before the “diversity” move-
ment.) It made me realize that
I was guilty of the very same
things I was accusing them of.
I thought, “What would hap-
pen if I gave these people a
chance?” So I did.

As things turned out, my
accusations of racism proved
to be false, and I needed to be
forgiven because I had indeed,
for the most part, prejudged
them. Although I no longer
have any affiliation with either
the school or church, I will be
eternally grateful for the
lessons I learned.

If you’re black, you may be
thinking now, “You mean we
have to forgive them for slav-
ery and brutality? We have to
forgive the Ku Klux Klan? We
have to forgive those who have
oppressed us all of these
years?” That’s right!

Because forgiveness is not
about burying the past — it’s
about moving on. You see,
your resentment and bitterness
don’t hurt them at all — but I
can guarantee that they’re
hurting you. Where do you
think the drug and alcohol
abuse comes from? Why do
you think people shoot each
other in the street, even in
broad daylight? Why do you
think racial tensions flare up
on campus from time to time?
Because certain people haven ’t
dealt with their anger!

During a recent discussion I
had with my roommate, I
made the observation that the
paramilitarists involved in the
Oklahoma City bombing were
obsessed with preserving their
freedom -— to the point of
being enslaved by it. In the
same way, when blacks com-

plain about oppression, I have
the sneaking suspicion that
the-y need to be oppressed,
because they have it so
ingrained in their minds that
they can’t live without it. On
the other hand, in the 22 years
since I changed my thinking,
rarely have I felt that way.

I have also learned that
racists often have other prob-
lems. For example, my former
girlfriend’s ex-husband (who
turned white as a ghost upon
seeing me for the first time,
and chewed her out the next
day for dating a “nigger”) is a
workaholic and womanizer
who abused her psychological-
ly during the four and a half
years of their marriage. When
I told a former schoolmate that
the seventh-grade teacher at
Trinity’didn’t like me in part
because I was black, he told
me, “He didn’t like a lot of
people.”

Several years ago, I heard a
white woman make this
remark about a church I knew
to be racist: “That church has
got a lot of bad attitudes.”
TV’s Archie Bunker had an
abusive father; former Ku
Klux Klansman and neo-Nazi
David Duke, an alcoholic
mother who never got over her
sister’s death. While I justify
neither their attitudes nor their
actions, I understand better
why they do what they do —
and that I don’t have to be
angry with them all the time.
Simply put, they may not
know any better.

As Perry McKinnon, a for-
mer aide to Al Sharpton who
had exposed the _Tawana
Brawley rape hoax, put it so
accurately in an interview with
Parade magazine, “If I were
prejudicedagainst a racist
today, I would be no better
than him.” So cancel those
debts and prove you’re more
of a human being than your
enemies. You may even turn
them into your friends. '

tn the Absence of Angels

Slavsl

(Thinking About the
Longstanding Problems of
Virtue and Happiness)

Producing Director: Marc
Masterson

Genius. It seems that it’s
fashionable to call any play-
wright who finds himself suc-
cessful on Broadway these
days by that title. It’s fashion-
able. However, after seeing
“Two-peat” Tony Kushner’s
latest work since Angels in
America, Slavsl, at City
Theater this past weekend, I
can pretty safely say that it
takes genius to orchestrate the
humanity of his message so
eloquently in the dialogue of a
few old men and an eight-
year-old girl.

City Theater provides the
audiencegwith an exciting
interpretation of real citizens’
feelings just before the crum-
bling of communist society.
The set, even though it takes
the “red” theme/parody to the
extreme, involves the audi-
ence in scenes that move
through, for example, Pan-
Soviet Archives for the Study
of Cerebro Cephalognomical
Historico-Biological
Materialism to an epilogue set
in heaven in this dark come-
dyldrama. The officials’ cos-
tumes, with their distracting
medals, show the audience
thefutility of the characters’
haphazard struggle to hold
onto a past never fully real-
ized. But it is Kushner’s
insightful monologues which
really form the showcase for
the actors to perform in.

The audience glimpses at a

— literally —- fatal speech of
idealistic theory, which is so
impassioned that it kills the
speaker and brings on the
death of another man. In
another scene, a pseudo-alco-
holic lesbian puts off the
advances of a sleazy official,
and, inadvertently, condemns
her troubled physician lover to
a couple of years in Siberia.
The characters In this play are
rich, endearing and well-devel-
oped. There are hazy lines of
confusion which cover the
“good” guys, the antagonists
and the simply deluded in this
production, which brings it
closer to reality. My favorite
monologue was the moving
condemnation of the govern-
ment by the mother (portrayed
by Demetria Mellott) of a child
facing an early death due to
radiation from a series of toxic
exposures. I believe that
Mellott’s performance pro-
voked the reaction that
Kushner was hoping for with
this production.

The play’s subtitle, Thinking
About the Longstanding
Problems of Virtue and
Happiness, was particularly
appropriate given the sense of
feeling in this work that forces
the the audience to look
beyond the fallen idols (Stalin,
Lenin) of the set, into their own
lives which may have at one
time or another harbored
apprehensions about the
future. This wordy, retrospec-
tive subtitle summarizes
Kushner’s detailed plot while
predicting what the audience
will leave the performance
doing.

Slavsl will be playing at the
City Theater through May 14.
Tickets: 43 1 -CITY.

Also being performed at City
Theater, May 19th and 20th at
8 p.m. is Marathons, a
Physical Theater production
with pre-show entertainment
by Etta Cox.

Cardenio
Directed by Kevin J.
Wetmore
The Unseam’d Shakespeare
Company

It was like “Sid and Nancy
Meet the Bard.” In this bawdy,
brawly production of
Shakespeare's lost play,
Cardenio, don’t expect to hear
the clash of rapiers like in ye
olden days, only the rattle of
chains. Lots of them —
attached to an assortment of
body parts. I mean, I thought
“Theater Unchained” was the
slogan of the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival this
summer!

Set in funky, post-modern
scenery (which even includes
a unique fridge that serves as
a mausoleum), this tragedy
deals primarily with the strug-
gle of deposed king, Cardenlo
(Matt Kubala), to regain, not
so much his throne, as the
freedom of his love, Luscinda
(Christina Petrillo) from the
clutches of deliciously twisted
Fernando (Tim Dawson), who
has overthrown him as leader.
As foil to Cardenio’s loyalty,
there is the subplot of his
brother, Anselmo’s adulterous
wife, Camilla, seduced by his
best friend, Lotario. Rebekah
Slotnick turns in a hilarious

Cardenio runs at the Pit through May 13th.

performance of CamilIa’s
maid, who undoes her mis-
tress.

The opening choreography
to Green Day’s “When I Come
Around,” was excellent, as
was Anselmo and Bellarius’
final sword/dagger play, but
the slightly overdone dance of
the other major fight scenes
were the only tedious points of
the play.

Along with its excess of
leather, is death galore (think
back to the body count of
Romeo and Juliet) and a new

suggestive theme for
Shakespeare, necrophilia.

Lengthy but fun, the
Unseam’d Shakespeare
Company’s Cardenio is a tight,
leathered, bound-up produc-
tion of a recently unearthed
tragedy produced, I believe,
for the first time in the ‘burgh.

Cardenio will be playing at
The Pit through May 13. For
tickets: 441-3141.

ie.sse ‘s 7

"Bring on the Loser" 7"ep
Eas River Pipe
Merge Records

Whether the platters are 12,10,7 or 5
inches, the single is an integral part of
selling music to the public. From
countless bar room jukeboxes to your
Aunt May’s stack of dusty 45s, one
could not experience recorded music
without coming in contact with these
two (or three) song wonders. Hell,
even CD3 couldn’t kill the vinyl single.
How many kids do you know that col-
lect CD5s?? Records have made a
comeback and the indipendent rock
scene has consistently chosen the
vinyl single for getting music to the
masses. Not only do records arguably
sound better and have some hip nos-
talgic quality, they are less expensive
than CDs for the music listener. The
average costs $3 or $4 and contains
three songs. This translates to more
bang for the buck, and avid musiuffs
can sample a wider variety of music
than the CD world could offer. The
most popular format seems to be the
7". They used to call them 45s, but
what about the ones that ran at 33
rpms? While the speed changes, the
7” diameter remains the same, so the

name stemmed from practicality and
now is a buzzword for any hipster. A
couple weeks ago, I found that there
was more than practical reasons for
the celebration of the 7”, and definitely
more than any ‘hipness’ it could bring.

East River Pipe’s “Bring on the
Loser” single is just brilliant. This
Merge release has to rank up in my
recent top ten favorites list , and could
easily contend with the best singles in
the Merge catalog. East River Pipe is
one man, F.M. Cornog. He now
resides in New York City, where he
records his music on an 8-track home
studio. Previous to this, he was literally
homeless and ill. I heard he had eaten
some acid and had a breakdown; sub-
sequently he lived on the streets out of
sheer desperation. Eventually a friend
helped him straighten out his life a bit
and convinced him to record some
songs he had penned from his off-kilter
experiences.

This would explain the passion and
emotion I hear in the the title song.
“Bring on the Loser” is a meloncholic
look at desperation and self pity.
Cornog’s voice is silky smooth, but his
dynamic capabilities make his somber
observations and seemingly pointless
wishes resonate commandingly. The
jangle from his guitar is well crafted
and the tone is rich and clean, coated
with a lush reverb. The Ringo Starrish
drumming is mixed fairly high and sur-

prisingly lacks the ‘tupperware’ sound
that many home recordings offer. In
general, the song does remind me of
the Beatles. Not just ‘‘I’m a Loser,” but
the entire 19605 Beatles’ songwriting
technique comes to mind. The music
seems basic, but on further examina-
tion subtle features wow and amaze. I
consider this pop because it employs
the verse-chorus-verse formula, and
the guitars sound nice, but this song is
not some bubblegum throwaway. It
makes feeling bad and confused
sound damn pretty. It does this without
sounding pathetic or overbearing (like
Morrisey can sometimes be). I think
the backing vocal sigh during the cho-
rus sums up my feeling for this song.
Ahh...The B-side features an instru-
mental “Fan the Flame” and another
vocal dazzler “Sleeping with TaIIboy.”
Both compliment the A-side wonderful-
Iy.

Why are singles in general so cool?
They give the listener a perfect dose of
enjoyable music. It’s hard to pollute a
single with a lot of junk that albums
can get plagued with —— there isn’t
much room for it. Of course, one bad
song could ruin one (law of averages),
but when they're good, they’re great!
“Bring on theLoser" is certainly great.

The Wild Bunch

Written and directed by Sam
Peckinpah

With William Holden, Robert
Ryan and Ernest Borgnine

With all the wannabe
badass shoot ‘em ups posing
as Westerns in this watered-
down post-Unforgiven revi-
sionist moment, it’s a relief to
have a real western from days
of yore rereleased— Sam
Peckinpah’s 1969 classic The
Wild Bunch — with real poss-
es, true grit cowboys and sul-
try temps. Maverick, Legends
of the Fall, Posse and
umpteen other contempo-
raries, y’all gotta thang to learn
here. Although the Westerns
of today accomplish a feel for
the man’s man West, it’s a
glossy-goopey feel, and com-
pared to the tough-as-nails
slow drawl pace of
Peckinpah’s piece, the charac-

ters in these films reflect the
pretty-boy personas of Mel
Gibson or Brad Pitt more than
the Duke or old Clint.

With one of the most riveting
credit sequences on film,
Peckinpah introduces the
opening shoot-out with freeze-
frame snap-shot which is
punctuated with William
Holden’s drawled command,
‘‘If they move, kill ‘em.” it’s
those cooler-than-all lines
counterpointing the manic
bloodbaths that make The
Wild Bunch a paragon of story
telling Western-style and
enduring cartoonish attitude.
The point is this: in
Peckinpah’s West, notions of
romanticized gallantry are
dead. Codes of morality are
also dead. Villagers are little
more than irrelevant saps who
provide a destination for stray
bullets and matter nothing
when blown away. The image

here also comes in the begin-
ning, an extreme close-up on
a horde of vicious red ants
under a blazing sun and spec-
ulation from local children. As
dire as the climate is hot, hot,
it’s a cruel, cruel animalistic
filmscape. Sentiment means
nothing; all that remains is
Pike Bishop's (William Holden)
stolid rectitude and Deke
Thorton’s (Robert Ryan)
steadfast devotion to bringing
the law to Pike’s bunch.

The story goes this way: it’s
1913 and Pike’s an old and
tired gunslinger who has
rounded a small group of ban-
dits up for small jobs like the
bank robbery that opens the
film. Deke Thorton leads a
band of bounty hunters out to
get Pike and posse and bring
them to justice. As it turns out,
long ago Pike was responsible
for sending Deke to jail, and
he’s out for revenge as much
as the bounty. Once Pike,
Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), and
the Gorsch brothers (Ben

Johnson and Warren Oates)
cross the border to Mexico,
they engage themselves in a
heist of U.S. weapons for a
faction in the Mexican govern-
ment, which is winning a war
with its peasants. Things go a
bit awry following the heist,
which results in an awesome
violent showdown with
Mexican officials.

There are few women in The
Wild Bunch, and representa-
tions of the female range from
the whore to the subservient
beau- most are little more than
objects of gratification for
these hard-livin” men. After
watching The Wild Bunch it’s
easy to see how Peckinpah
gained a notorious reputation
as a hard-drinking misogynist.
But perhaps it’s a bit of justice
when Pike is fatally shot by a
woman —— provoking a “Bitch!”
explosion from Holden before
a child finishes him off. Here,
the rude and unapologetic
gets his comeuppance —— and
the idea of a woman having

the final say about a man’s
man is something to chew on.

Unlike Eastwoods’
Unforgiven, Peckinpah
delights in his stock charac-
ters. He neither tries to add a
twist on the characters being
or create some kind of anti-
western. Bearing in mind the
most acclaimed western of
recent years, with Clint misfir-
ing his rifle over and over in
Unforgiven —— which carries
the message that he’s a bit too
washed up and seen too much
to still be fightin’ — it’s a hell of
a pleasure to see Holden
shoot his gun and actually hit.
And hit often.

The Wild Bunch opens at

are 7:15 and 10 p.m. daily,

Wrlght were decided

by trash-talk-
ing, the Reggie Miller-led
Indiana Pacers would be
defending champions coasting
to another title with little or no

trouble. ’ _
But the NBA title is decided

based on the ability of five men
to throw an orange sphere into
an orange circle more times
than any other group of ﬁve
men.

And unfortunately for the
Knicks, Magic and Bulls, it
looks like Indiana can do that
too.

If you’re reading this, you
already know about Miller’s
heroics against the Knicks last
Sunday and in Game 5 of last
year’s Eastern Conference
ﬁnals. You may be less familiar,
though, with an emerging star in
the middle.

The Dunkin’ Dutchman —
Rik Smits from Marist (as Keith
and Dan would say).

At 7-foot-4, Smits is the
”‘ at $33 13 the N133 who is
not completely awkward at all
times. (Ever seen Bradley,
Muresan or Bol attempting
those 18-foot jumpers Smits hits
on a regular basis?) Height isn’t
everything in the NBA, but
when playing Orlando or New
York it must feel awfully good
to have Shaq or Ewing looking
up a good three or four inches at
you.

While Miller got all the press
for Sunday’s huge win, Smits
tossed in a game-high 34 points
to keep the Pacers on top for
most of the game and close at
the end.

NBC’s Tom Hammonds said
Smits wants to use this match—,
up with Ewing to prove that he
is among the elite centers in the
league. While Smits was having
a career game, New York’s
“elite center” scored a whop-
ping 11 points, thanks to the
defense of Smits, Antonio
Davis and Sam Mitchell (I’ll
pause while you all say in uni-
son, “Sam who?”). Of course,
that’s 11 times as many points
as Ewing scored in Game 3 of
last year’s Eastern Conference
final against those same Pacers.

The Pacers/Knicks rivalry is
well-documented, but Indiana
has some history with the other
remaining teams in the Eastern
Conference as well. Orlando
Magic? The Pacers swept them
out of last year’s first round.

Big East cloor Championships
.

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Not even Dietrich Jells’ two
first—place finishes at the 1995
Big East Conference Outdoor
Track & Field Championships
were good enough to defend
Pitt’s men’s Outdoor title last
weekend at Villanova
University.

Georgetown, the new champi-
on, foiled the Panthers’ back-to-
back bid by beating Pitt by 58
points. Georgetown scored 148

. points to Pitt’s 90. The women’s

team, also fighting to repeat as
the Outdoor champions, fin-
ished third behind Connecticut
and Villanova, respectively.

“We got blood out of a
turnip,” head coach Steve Lewis
said. “There’s a difference
between losing and getting beat.
Combined, we had more first-
place finishers than any other
school.”

Lewis said the big difference
in the meet was the number of
people‘ each team had. For
example, Georgetown’s men’s
team had 35 members, while
Pitt only fielded 17 people.
Oftentimes when Pitt came in
ﬁrst, the other teams with more
people had a logjam of people
placing.

Jells led the men’s charge as

Willard lands 7 -foot

journeyman, fina//y

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Coach Ralph Willard’s
recruiting class for the 1995-
96 basketball season has
been ranked as high as sec-
ond in the country and is
routinely ranked in the top
five by most of the top
recruiting services. Last
Friday, it got even better.

Willard was able to land
Mark Blount, a 7-foot center
out of Dobbs Ferry High
School in New York. In his
senior season, Blount aver-
aged 24 points, 14 rebounds
and six blocks a game.

He has another impressive
stat, but this one is not bas-
ketball-related. Blount has
attended seven high schools
in four years, including two
years at the famed Oak Hill
Academy in Virginia.

Blount has often been
described as “a misunder-
stood kid.”

“He wasn’t going around
getting kicked out of
schools,” said assistant bas-
ketball coach Sean Cleary.
“A couple of schools
wouldn’t let him play basket-
ball, so he transferred out.”

from Baton Rouge, La.;

Blount is the sixth and
ﬁnal recruit for Willard. He
will join other signees
Vonteego Cummings, a 6-4
guard from Thompson, Ga.;
Michael Gill, a 6-7 forward
from Washington; Isaac
Hawkins, also a 6-7 forward

Andre Howard, 3 6-8 for-
ward from Philadelphia; and
6-2 guard Kellii Taylor from
Maine Central Institute.

After last season, Blount
was selected as a Parade
All-American, and he also
was named player of the year
in Westchester County.

With the graduation of
Jaime Peterson, Blount is
likely to be in the starting
ﬁve. That is, if he attains the
minimum required score on
his SATs.

He joins Cummings and
Hawkins on the list of those
who haven’t reached the
minimum. However, they
have “scores outstanding,”
which means that they are
very close to passing and
may do so as early as next
week.

“He’s very athletic and
agile for a kid his size,” said

pion, beating Syracuse’s Corey
Ward by .06 of a second with a
time of 10.39. Pitt’s Jay Jones

took third with Anthony Dorsett
right behind him. .

The football trio of Jells,
Jones and Dorsett teamed up
with Jerel Williams to win the
400-meter relay with a time of
40.75. Also, Jay Murphy
nabbed the l10—meter hurdle
crown with a 13.86 ﬁnish. Wes
Alexander placed fifth in the
event

Jells fell .26 of a second short
of taking his third ﬁrst-place ﬁn-
ish of the weekend, in the 200-
meter, behind the Big East’s
Outstanding Track Performer,
Seton Hall’s Kevin Lyles.

“Dietrich is just getting start- .

ed,” Lewis said. “He’s just start-
ing to run. This is his first meet
since April 7.”

Alexander rounded off the
first-place finishers, as he took
the 400-meter hurdles with a
time of 51.34. Williams took
third and Orrel Green placed
ﬁfth.

After the first day of competi-
tion, the women’s team was in
seventh place. But that was
before Najuma Fletcher
launched herself to two first-
place jumps on Sunday.

Fletcher, who was once again
named the Women’s
Outstanding Field Performer,
won the triple jump with a leap
of 43-4 1/4. Then, she followed

Tennis teams close
seasons in Miami

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

On April 21, the Pitt men’s
and women’s tennis teams trav-
elled to Miami to close out their
respective seasons at the Big
East Championships.

“It was a great finish to the
Big East,” said head coach
George Dieffenbach.

The men’s team began the
weekend by losing 4-0 to St.
Johns, with a good showing
from the number one doubles
team of Braden Doherty and
Brad Wade. They defeated Peter
Matus and N. Moukhatasov 8-5
for the only Pitt win of the
match.

Pitt was shut out in the singles

i matches.

Next the Panthers faced Seton
Hall and got the victory with a 4-
1 margin. '

Doherty, Wade, Christian
Frenza and Stephen Rosenthal
picked up singles victories, with
Rosenthal’s 6-2, 6-1 decision
clinching the match for Pitt. The
Pirates got their only point by
taking two of the three doubles
matches.

“This was a good victory for
us,” Dieffenbach said.

With a 1-1 record, Providence
was up next for the Panther
squad. The matches were close,

but the Friars proved to be too
much, defeating Pitt 4-0. A

In a battle for seventh place,
the Panthers matched up against
Connecticut, and it came down

to the ﬁnal match.

“It was as tight a match as you ,
could ever get,” ' said _
Dieffenbach.

Doubles were first, and the
number two team of Frenza and
Mike Sullivan defeated the duo
of Eric Engstrom and Mitch
Katz 8-4. Pitt’s number one team
of Doherty and Wade held off
UConn’s Brian Monihan and
Richard Saxe in a tiebreaker, 9-
8, after being down 7-6.

Those victories got Pitt one
point going into the singles
matchups. The Panthers needed
to win three of the six singles
matches to take the seventh spot
in the tournament.

Monihan defeated Doherty 6-
3, 6-4 to notch the match at one
apiece. Frenza lost in third sin-
gles to Saxe in three sets, 6-3, 6-
7, 6-3. UConn’s Katz then

defeated Sullivan 5-7. e4, so to .

give the Huskies a 3-1 advan-
tage. ‘

This is where Pitt began its
comeback.

Matt Mills was able to defeat 7
Adam Tardif in three sets, 7-6, 4- - 
6, 6-3, and Rosenthal defeated

Record-breaking Pitt
baseball in playoffs for

second straight season

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

The Panther baseball team,
after getting crushed in game
one of a three-game set with
rival Boston College, rallied
for a doubleheader sweep on
Sunday-that propelled the
squad into the Big East play-
offs for the second year in a
row.

Pitt claimed the fourth and
final spot in the tournament,
slated for May 16-21, at
Bristol, Connecticut. The
Panthers will be matched up
with the top-seeded
Providence Friars in the first
round of the double elimina-
tion tournament.

Yesterday, the Panthers
were on the road battling
West Virginia. Coach Mark
Jackson could not be reached
for comment.

Another trend is develop-
ing for the Panthers — for
the third year in a row
they set a team record for
wins, this campaign they
finished with 33. The most
recent Panther victories
came at Boston College
last weekend.'After getting
pounded 13-2 on
Saturday, Pitt came back
strong in the doubleheader
on Sunday.

Outfielder Jason Conti
continiued his torrid hitting
as he drove in the game—win-
ning run in game one of
the doubleheader. The
Panthers were trailing 3-0
in the fourth inning when
outfielder Josh Mellor
connected for a two—run

homer. Conti, whose .386
batting average leads
the Panthers in Big East
play, singled in the top of
the seventh to clinch the
game.

Game two was an offen-
sive explosion. Pitt and BC
combined for 32 hits and
scored 27 total runs. For the
third time this year, Pitt
scored 15 runs in a game and
they knocked out the Eagles,
15-12.

Third baseman Jon
DeBernardis lead the
attack for Pitt. The senior
went five for five and
drove in four runs. Junior
outfielder Bob Miller drove
in three runs, including a
two—run homer. Senior pitch-
er Tedde Campbell got the
win;

Campbell picked up three
wins in a one—week period
to improve his record to 12-
3. Along with the win
against BC, Campbell
mowed down the
Georgetown Hoyas earlier in
the week, claiming one win
in a Panther sweep.
Campbell struck out 11 in
that game, bringing his
team-leading total to 87.

The~Panthers have a tough
road ahead of them. The
Providence Friars swept the
Panthers last month, outscor-
ing them 21-7. In addition,

the Panthers have lost five of ‘

six games to the other two
teams in the tournament,
Villanova and Seton Hall.
Their lone victory was a 12-
5 decision over Seton Hall
on April 9.

Three Panthers head to NFL

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

NFL Draft.

(207 overall).

All speculation was finally put to rest two weeks ago when Reuben Brown, Pitt’s behe-
moth offensive lineman, was selected as the 14th overall pick by the Buffalo Bills in the

Some draft experts felt that Brown, a 6-foot—3-inch, 305-pound tackle, was too small to
play the position. But Brown’s speed and strength made him the second offensive lineman
selected in April 22-23’s draft.

Two other Panthers were drafted as well. Curtis Martin, Pitt’s fifth all-time leading rusher,
who passed up a possible redshirt to enter the draft, was taken by the New England Patriots
in the third round (74th overall). _

“I thought he was going in the second round to be quite honest,” Pitt running back coach
Charlie Coe said. “Dallas came to his house the night before and really expressed interest.”

However, Dallas opted for Alabama’s star back Sherman Williams instead as the 46th pick.
Martin’s stock may have been lowered because he has been injury-prone in the past. 1

‘‘It’s a crap shoot,” Coe said. “If he stays healthy, he’ll have a fine career. New England
was looking for a running back. If he carries the ball 10 to 15 times a game, then he’ll do real
good. He’s capable of doing it.”

Tom Barndt, a 6-4, 275-pound defensive lineman, rounded out the Pitt players drafted. The
two-time all-Big East selection was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the sixth round

nailed a second-place ﬁnish in the long jump with

a distance of 20-0 1/2.

Fletcher, a junior, is now a 12-time Big East

champion.

“She is the most dynamic competitor and ath-
lete I have ever seen,” Lewis said. “She’s an

extremely special person.”

The Panthers’ Sunday surge didn’t stop with
Fletcher — senior Lakeya Smith captured the

Purter landed behind Smith in third and Fletcher

°From page 4

Dave Dumple, a now former play-
er who sat out last season due to
injury. “Everybody was at home,
nobody knew. It was a cowardly
way to do it.

“It’s ironic that they cut teams
that have opposite women’s
teams,” he added. “I would love to
see a women’s soccer team and
other women’s teams, but I don’t
want to see i.t at the expense of a
men’s team.

“We don’t ask for anything.
We’re constantly sharing space
with other teams, we always take
the sacriﬁce.”

The men’s gymnastics team had
also been a very successful pro-
gram. Since 1968, the team com-
piled an overall record of 218- 188.
Frank D’Amico, who had
coached the team since 197 8,
never had a losing record and ﬁn-
ished with an overall record of
200-110, including going 19-11

D’Amico was unavailable for

eliminated in the country, leaving
only 33 in all three divisions,
roughly 900 schools.

One problem that many people
and coaches have with Title IX is
that men’s football and wrestling
are included in the statistics. Often
there is upwards of 110 football
players to include. This is enough
to tip the scale of equal representa-
tion in favor of the male athletes
because there is no female equiva-
lent.

Yesterday there were
Congressional hearings on Title IX
concerning thisyproblem. The
Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee met to
determine how well Title IX is
working, according to USA Today

The athletes currently involved
in men’s tennis and gymnastics
who have been receiving financial
aid will continue to receive it.

Also, any athletes from either of
these sports who wish to transfer
will be able to do so and will
immediately be eligible for com-
petition. Usually, transfers must sit
out ayear.

Dieffenbach said that none of his
tennis players have approached
him about this possibility.

“The most difficult thing is to
take away opportunities for one
group to add for another,” said
Jaynes.

dropped the second set 6-7. He
then fell behind in the third 6-5

being up 40-0, before mounting
his comeback. Wade came back

The Panthers finished their
season with a record of 13-12.

“The team made steady
progress throughout the year. It
was a tremendous ﬁnish to our

The women’s team was not
quite as lucky, finishing in last
place.

In the first round they were

up their only point in doubles.

Zielinski and Fran Davis
defeated Kelly Barnes and

_Kerry Dillon in number one

doubles, 8-6. And the number
three team of Siegel and
Deborah Baird defeated Jen
Grant and Erin O’Shea 8-1.

Villanova picked up its four
points by sweeping the singles
matches.

The women closed out their
year with a record of 13-12, and
tied the school record for all-
time wins, which was set in
1975.

“The team was much more
competitive,” said Dieffenbach.
“We’ll expect to do even better
next year, but it was a real great
year for both the men and
women.”
