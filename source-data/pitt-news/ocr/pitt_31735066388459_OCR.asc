Pitt should eliminate its ROTC program by 1997 if the
Department of Defense continues to discriminate against
gays and lesbians, according to a report released by a
University Senate committee.

The committee’s recommendations come after six
months of studying the conﬂia between ROTC’s exclusion
of gays and lesbians and Pitt’s policy prohibiting
discrimination based on sexual orientation.

In its report, the committee specified that ROTC is a
university program which must follow Pitt’s rules. This
directly contradicts statements made by outgoing Pitt
President Wesley Posvar in May 1989, when the conﬂict
over the ROTC policy was first raised. Posvar classified
ROTC as an "outside organization" and said that the
nondiscrimination policy does not apply. Posvar is out of
town and could not be reached for comment.

Although any student is allowed to enroll in ROTC
classes, students who wish to receive ROTC scholarship
money and progress toward a commission must sign a

Specific Recommendations

1. That the university acknowledges the conﬂict
between its current nondiscrimination policy and the
Department of Defense’s position.

2. That the university recognizes that the ROTC
program is supported by the university and has the
necessary hallmarks of a university program. (These
include provision of space, of equipment, some staff
support and listing in university journals and brochures
as a university program) '

3. That the effort should be to join with the American
Association of Universities to inﬂuence the Defense
Department's position. The AAU, through its chief officers,
has attempted to communicate with the Defense
Department about the concerns of many AAU members.

4. That this effort should also be carried on through the
office of the president of the University of Pittsburgh in
direct communication with the Department of Defense.

contract which asks about sexual orientation. Since the
DOD prohibits homosexuals in the military, students
who indicate on the form that they are gay are expelled

Posvar’ s
pay hike

A Committee recommends removal of ROTC in 199 7

from ROTC. ROTC instructors are participating in a
training camp this week and could not be reached for
comment. In the past, ROTC leaders have maintained that
they have no control over DOD policy.

The committee recommended that Pitt join the American
Association of Universities in inﬂuencing the DOD to
change its policy. The office of the president should also
try to inﬂuence the DOD to change, the committee said.

The committee’s recommendations are reasonable,
according to Barbara Shore, University Senate president
and chair of the ROTC committee.

“We struggled very hard until we got to what we
thought was  a position that would respect the ROTC
and their desire to be part of that process and to respect
the kids who are therriselves gay, lesbian or bisexual and
the offense that this is to them,” Shore said.

The recommendations are a middle ground between
ignoring the situation and immediately throwing ROTC

off campus, Shore said.

“It is an effort to accomplish the long-range goal, which
is to get the DOD to change its policy,” Shore said.

Concerns
faculty

ByJenna Ferrara
News Editor '

Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
$55,000 salary increase, which
came at a time when the faculty
was clamoring for pay raises, is
indicative of the university’s
reluctance to raise faculty salaries
to the Association of American

‘ Universities average, United Fac-

ulty President Philip Wion said.

In accordance with federal law,
university officials disclosed last
week that Posvar’s salary had
been raised to $242,000 in the
1989-90 fiscal year. ,

“Obviously, that's a huge jump
when the administration was
claiming that there were budget
difficulties for the university as a
whole and when faculty salaries
were not increasing at anything
like that rate [of Posvar’s raisel,"
said Wion, an associate professor
of English. “[Posvar’s raise] came
when the administration has been
asserting to the faculty that there
was no money” to increase faculty
salaries, said Wion, an assistant
professor of English.

The average pay for a university
president in the 57-member
Association of American
Universities is $152,876.

“A 29—percent increase is very
high, especially when the base
pay for presidents of universities
was also very high,” said Wion.
“This is rather puzzling —- how
the trustees could justify such a
large increase.”

Wion said that the average Pitt
faculty salary ranked 50th among

Pro—lzfers form human chain across Oakland

By Renee Crespy
News Editor

About 6,000 protesters lined
the streets of Oakland Sunday
afternoon to form the Greater
Pittsburgh Life Chain, the largest
pro-life event ever held in
southwestern Pennsylvania. All
of the participants held identical
signs that read “Abortion Kills
Children."

The Life Chain, a church-run
operation, was intended to show
that Pittsburgh citizens are
opposed to abortion, according
to Stephen Smith, coordinator for
the Greater Pittsburgh Life Chain.
I “We are communicating two
simple truths. The first is that
abortion destroys the life of an
innocent child, and the second is

, Jesus Christ offers forgiveness and

healing to the broken hearts of
women who have had abortions,”
said Smith.

Other participants said they
were there to help save the
innocent lives of unborn children.

- Stephen Smith

Rich Paladin, Pastor for Word
and Worship Fellowship Church,
said that he hoped to show
onlookers that abortion kills.

“Even if only one person driving
by would see a sign and have a
change of heart and see abortion
for what it is, it would be worth
it,” said Paladin, who has
participated in several anti-
abortion rallies.

According to Paladin, women
have several alternatives to
abortion.

“We can provide complete
financial assistance for the mother.

There is adoption. We can give
people a place to live. There are
so many choices, and abortion
isn’t one of them," said Paladin.

Others felt that if abortion were
made illegal, it would violate their
rights.

who skateboarded . past the
demonstration wearing a sign that
read, “Illegal Abortion Kills

The Life Chain stretched eight
sidewalk miles. It started on Craft
and Fifth avenues, and proceeded
through Shadyside to the
intersection of Fifth and Penn
avenues,‘ where the chain
extended both ways.

The Life Chain was started in
1987 by a pro-life organization in
Yuba City, Calif., where it has
since spread across the country.

This was the first Life Chain
ever to be held in Pittsburgh.
Three other chains were also
conducted throughout the state:
one in Greensburg which
involved approximately 2,500; the

‘ Scottsdale-Everson Chain that had

400 to 500 participants and the
Delaware County Chain of over
5,000. The Life Chains are a
prelude to the National Day of
Life Chains, which will be held
on Oct. 6. Several million people
are scheduled to participate.

Pitt evaluation turns up research concerns

By Jim Wechsler

Asst. News Editor

Pitt just received its report card.

The Commission on Higher
Education of the Middle States
Association of Colleges and
Schools determines whether or
not to re-accredit universities.
Evaluation teams of faculty and
administrators » from member
institutions present their
suggestions for improvement to
the MSA.

Because of the enormity of this
task, the MSA allows each

_ institution to do a self-study on

an aspect of its performance. The
self-study is reviewed by the
evaluation team before the team’s
four-day visit to the campus. This
year Pitt focused on research.
The stakes were high. Without
accreditation, Pitt would lose
prestige as well as eligibility for
federal scholarships. Although the
final decision won’t be revealed
until June, Jerome Rogers, who
chaired the 21-member self—study,
said it is unlikely Pitt will lose its

accreditation.

The MSA team, chaired by G.
Dennis O’Brien, president of the
University of Rochester (N.Y.),
listed three areas of concern in its
report: redeﬁning Pitt’s mission,
stability and structure of
administration, and
communication.

As a “multiversity,” Pitt has
many specialties, the team
discovered. But the evaluators
said the vast expansion of Pitt’s
research capabilities over the past
10 years may require Pitt to revise
its mission statement.

The team heard criticisms of
imbalance in Pitt’s research
programs.

Some students in the health-
science ﬁelds said research was
being conducted at the expense
of quality teaching. This concern
arose because of financial
rewards offered to faculty who
brought in large outside research
grants. The health professions
are the only schools with bonus
programs. The MSA ‘ team
suggested either the elimination
of the reward system or the

for excellence in teaching It
reminded teachers not to
overlook “the teaching power of
research.”

Some members of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences said the lack
of outside funding for areas such
as the humanities requires Pitt to
allocate more of its own funds
for research in those departments:

The team ruled that Pitt’s
research priorities reﬂect national
trends ‘and are not dis-
proportionate.

The team said Pitt’s 1986
acquisition of former Gulf Oil
research labs refueled the applied
research vs. academic research
debate.

While these labs will probably
divert attention from academics,
the investment potential of the
labs, renamed the University of
Pittsburgh Applied Research
Center, was too good to pass up,
said MSA evaluators.

The team said all of these

areas deserved attention but were

the AAU schools in 1989-90. .

Barbara Shore, president of Pitt’s University Senate, said that
if the purpose of Posvar’s raise was to bring his salary closer to
AAU averages, faculty salaries might be increased accordingly.

University spokesperson Tim Ziaukas said Posvar’s salary
increase was justified. “The university’s recent search for a new
president made it clear that the current salary levels were
inadequate, and the board [of trustees] thought the president
should be more fairly compensated.”

Ziaukas said that the university is working to raise faculty and
staff salaries above the AAU averages.

He also finds the lateness of the disclosure to be suspicious.
“It’s interesting that this is being released now, rather than in the
fall  Posvar said he welcomed the opportunity to reveal
salaries. Well, if he’d really believed that, he would have
revealed it last September,” said Wion.

Posvar received a vote of no confidence from the faculty of
arts and sciences in 1989. .

Doctors and medical administrators such as Thomas Detre,
president of Pitt’s medical center, are among Pitt’s highest-paid
employees. Detre earned $325,000 in 1989-90, a $25,000 raise
from 1988-89.

The four highest paid Pitt faculty members in 1989-90 were:
0 James H. Herndon, chairperson of orthopedic surgery,
$409,500
0 Thomas Starzl, chief of transplant surgery, $350,000
0 Bartley P. Griffith, professor of surgery, $325,000

overhead expenses.

Philip Wion, president of United
Faculty, said that many of the
items, such as travel expenses for
spouses of administrators, should
never have been charged to
university funds at all.

“If an administrator wants to’

take a spouse. on a business trip
 they pay for it themselves, not
charge it to the. institution,” said

Wion. “Should any kind of
[university] money be spent on
the lavish lifestyles of
administrators when there are
better expenses the money could
be put to?” he said.

Wion, who spearheaded an
unsuccessful effort to unionize
Pittfacultyandstaff, also criticized
theuniversityforspendingmoney
on anti-union attorneys and
billing the charges to overhead. .

But university spokesperson
Tim Ziaukas said, “All the
expenses were appropriate
expenses,” including Pittsburgh
Athletic Association and golf-club
memberships.

“That's how business is done.
The president of the university
probably needs to belong to a
few of those [social] clubs that a
professor of political science or
history wouldn’t  Things like 
holiday cards [for Posvarl  are
legitimate development tools,"
Ziaukas said.

Barbara Shore, president of the
Faculty Senate, said the decision
to bill an expense to the university
“has to be made based on solid
guidelines.”

“Some of social expenses are
business expenses, but it has to
be clearly demonstrated that such
is the case,” Shore said.

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, May 22, 1991

Continued frompage 1
The committee’s suggestions
are a first step in implementing
the new policy, Shore said. The
proposal must be passed by the
Faculty Assembly and the Senate
Council. ’
Shore said she is unsure
whether the the university

_ president or the Board of Trustees

will ultimately decide whether to
implement the policy.

Shore has already met with
Provost Donald Henderson to

\.:“diSCuSS the recommendations.

Henderson will forward the
information to President—elect
John Dennis O’Connor.
O’Connor is out of town and
was unavailable for comment.
During a visit to "campus in April,
O’Connor addressed the issue of

I‘ the conflict between Pitt’s

nondiscrimination policy and the
ROTC.

“It is a very difficult issue,”

‘O’Connor said. “If someone

Kwould have asked me about that
‘ Eiuestion four years agowhen I

was at the University of California,
my response would have been,
‘If the Army or the Air Force or
the Navy cannot come up with a
policy that fits a non—bias in terms

of sexual orientation, then I’ll‘

throw them off Campus.’ When
you ask me that question today,
I am not as glib. I cannot say that
 ‘My Carolina experience has
really had a tremendous effect on
me in terms of the military. Over
20 percent of all of the American

\,.,_troops in the Persian Gulf came

out of North Carolina. The military

is a very important option forthe -

youth.”

The Department of Defense
deferred all questions about the
policy to the U.S. Army ROTC
cadet command at Fort Monroe,
Va.

Jack Muhlenbeck of the Cadet
Command’s public affairs office
said he has heard reports of similar
actions at other colleges. ROTC
simply follows the rules of the
Defense,
Muhlenbeck said.

“The Department of Defense
ofﬁcial policy on the situation is
contained in the following
language: Homosexuality is
incompatible with military
service,” Muhlenbeck said.

Muhlenbeck refused further
comment.

The university community's

reaction to the committee’s
recommendation was mixed.

Kurt Weinschenker, who
graduated from Pitt’s ROTC
program in April, said he disagrees
with the committee’s recommend-
ations.

Weinschenker stressed that his
opinions were his own and not
necessarily those of the ROTC.

“I think it is stupid. I really
think it is stupid. ROTC has been
at this university for 75 years,”
Weinschenker said.

Weinschenker said the policy
is the result of pressure by the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance. I

“I think this is definitely a
pressure tactic from a minority
public interest group to bend the
collective university to their will,”
Weinschenker said.

“If they want to do something,
let’s see it done with intelligent
reason and thought .-Let's not see

it done by heavy-handed slam-I

dunking of a minority within the
university community -- which is
what the ROTC really is,”

Weinschenker said.

Commissions for the armed
forces come directly from the
president of the United States,
who the committee should try to
sway, he said.

Weinschenker said that military
policy is a reflection of American
public sentiment.

“Traditionally in this nation we
have said that one must be
heterosexual in order to have
moral character. For better or for
worse, this is just the way it is,” he
said.

Melissa Smith, co—president of
BiGALA, said she is generally
pleased with the recommend-
ations.

“I feel 1997 is too long to
wait. Too many years of
discrimination will be allowed to
pass until 1997. The committee
acknowledges the conflict, and
to wait six years for it is wimpy.
Action needs to be taken now.

With the new president coming '

in, this is something he can prove
to- the university, to the people in
this community,” she said.

5. That it be understood that the University of Pittsburgh will notify _

the Defense Department that it will not continue the ROTC program
on campus after 1997 if there are no appropriate changes in the policy.
This notification should make it clear that Pitt is willing to continue the
program if the policy that discriminates against homosexuals is
reversed.

6. Until this reversal occurs in all the literature that the university
issues which describes the ROTC programs, including catalogues, a
statement will be made that the Department of Defense policies
discriminate against students on the basis of sexual orientation, and
therefore are not in compliance with the university's anti-discrimination
policy. ROT,C programs will be eliminated at the university in 1997
unless these discriminatory practices are stopped.

7. The university wishes to support those students who are directly

and adversely affected by the discriminatory policies of the Department _

of Defense.
8. The president’s office should continue to monitor progress and
report back to the university community as appropriate.

“My resignation letter was
leaked to the press, ” said Carlisle.
According to the Press, Carlisle

‘ said in the letter that he thought

university officials downplayed
details of an internal investigation
of Adovasio’s term. Carlisle-did
not deny the handling of the
Adovasio investigation was one
of the main reasons for his
resignation, but he said yesterday
there were other major reasons.
Carlisle said he had agreed to
become the interim director of

the CRMP, but he felt 18 months

was “a little long" for an interim
position. He said he left partly
because a replacement director
could have been found in that
time.

“I wasn’t getting the kind of
assurances I needed to continue
on as interim director,” Carlisle
said.

A spokesperson for the‘

university, Robert Reteshka,
refused to speculate about the
future of the CRMP.

Reteshka said Pitt decided some
of Adovasio’s expenses "were
unnecessary. One instance cited
was a contract with the Utah
Department of Transportation,
where Adovasio refused to use
power tools and backhoes to dig
at some of the sites because he
said the tools would have erased
signs of early civilization. The
delays, along with some of
Adovasio’s questionable travel
claims, cost UDOT more money

than expected. Reteshka said Pitt

asked Adovasio to repay the.

money.

“He agreed to pay the money
back, and he did. We consider
the matter closed,” Reteshka said.
Reteshka would not reveal the
amount of the payment but said
it was “less than $2,000.” _

Carlisle said he did not accuse
the administration of
mismanagement, as the Press
reported yesterday. Reteshka,
who said he had seen the letter,
also could not remember Carlisle
making any allegations.

_ “To my knowledge, he didn't
[accuse the administration of
mismanagementl,” said Reteshka.

The Press reported that

Adovasio said the allegations
against him were partly because
of professional jealousy. Three
archaeologists from Pitt have since
joined him at Mercyhurst College,
where Adovasio is the chairperson
of the archaeology department.
“It makes it very diflicult to
complete reports when you have
a diminishing staff," Carlisle said.
According to Carlisle, the CRMP
has been productive despite the
loss of staff. The CRMP completed
33 proposals for 24 different
sponsors in the past year. Of these
sponsors, 19 were new clients,
according to Carlisle. Carlisle said
the CRMP had a S&percentsuccess
rate for securing contracts for the
proposals.

ROTC defies Pitt policy...

The University of Pittsburgh’s policy is clear in prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

The Department of Defense’s policy is clear in prohibiting
gays, lesbians and bisexuals from serving in the armed
forces and from receiving scholarships and other ROTC
benefits.

ROTC is a university program which defies university
policies.

It was determined by a University Senate committee that
since Pitt supplies office space and support-staff salaries, .
among other things, ROTC is subject to ALL university
policies. , _

Despite numerous futile attempts in the past to reform
this Department of Defense policy, this committee has
finally devised a workable eight—point plan to end this
contradiction.

The committee wants "the university to confront the
Department Of Defense with an ultimatum: Change the

policy or ROTC will be eliminated from this campus by

1997.

University Senate President Barbara Shore stated the
purpose of the plan: “What we are really hoping is that the
Department of Defense will get convinced that their
policy is not good and will change their policy.”

This decision is not an attack against Pitt’s ROTC program.

.It is an_attack on its governing facility, the Department of
~ Defense.

While we recognize that anti-homosexual bias in the

military will be hard to overcome, the University Senate’s '

action is part of a nationwide movement by other;
universities, such as Northwestern, to force the DOD to

accept gays and lesbians, many who have proved

themselves as outstanding soldiers before they were
dishonorably discharged. Although it is important to keep 1
in mind that we are dealing with the lumbering federal
government — infamous for its reluctance to change —
this should not dissuade the university from taking a stand
against heterosexism. .

The Department of Defense has argued that the inclusion
of homosexuals in the armed forces would undermine
morale and incite insubordination among heterosexual
enlisted personnel who report to a homosexual officerr
However, the same arguments were used many years ago
when the military fought against the assimilation of women
and blacks into the armed forces. While the transition of
women and blacks into the military was a difficult one,‘
these groups have now proven themselves to be among
the military’s finest. '

The Pitt News disagrees with the DOD’s assertion that
homosexuals are not compatible with the military and
supports the University Senate committee’s
recommendation. I

, Memorial Day weekend kicks
off, the summer for ‘America in
general and Hollywood in
particular, as sweaty moviegoers
search for air conditioning and a
good ﬂick to ﬁll their lazy summer
afternoons.
The big movies of summer look
to be the ones with the biggest
stars (no surprise there). Newly
Oscared Kevin Costner follows
up his astounding success in
Dances With Wolves with Robin
Hood.- Prince of Thieves, 21 film
rumored to have lots of tension
, , on the set. Kevin Reynolds directs
(without any hits on his resume)
and Costner, not the world’s
greatest actor, has to dub an
English accent — like America's
females care. For the male
members of the audience, the
luscious Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio does her version of
Maid Marian.It should be cool to
see. a picturesque, modern
rendition of Robin.

sex-changed Loz/eStory, with Scott
doing Ali MacGraw’s part as the
noble young lover headed for
death's door. Joel Schumacher,
of the moody and stylish
Flatliners, directs what is sure to
be Julia's next big hit.
Arnold Schwarzenegger makes
good on his “I’ll be back” threat
with Terminator 2.- judgement

Day, James Cameron's high-
budget ($140 million) sequel to
the awesomely successful The
Terminator. Supposedly it
focuses on the metaphysical
relationships between humans
and machines, but this is really a
special-effects lover’s paradise. It
looks like dumb fun for
Schwarzenegger’s legion of fans.

Bruce Willis has his own high-
budget adventure, playing a
former cat burglar who must rob
the great museums of Europe in
Hudson Hawle. Michael
Lehmann, who last did the low-
budget cult phenom Heathers,
directs Willis and his movie
partner-in—crime , Andie
MacDowell. Willis does some
singing, scarily enough, indulging
his ego to the extreme. Can't
Demi Moore keep him
somewhere?

Naleed Gun 21/2: The Smell of
Fear promises to be fun, with
more from the files of “Police
Squad.” Leslie Nielsen reprises
his role as courageous but stupid

a torch for Priscilla Presley’s lovely

Mario’s back! Of course it’s a
pun, but Lernieux’s return to the
lineup last night in Minnesota has
reclaimed the Penguins’ home-
ice advantage and evened this

 

  

brutal Stanley Cup series at two
games apiece.

It certainly wasn’t easy,
although the game started out
like a rout withthe Penguins
scoring three times in the game’s
first four minutes to stifle the
North Stars and theif wound—up

followers — whether they were
at the packed Met Centre or
watching on pay-per-view cable.

Kevin Stevens scored the Pens’
opener as he deeked a Minnesota
defender, then slipped a tricky
wrist shot by Jon Casey, who
flopped to the ice backwards as
he watched the puck trickle past
the goal line. Stevens figured in
on the Pens’ second goal as well
by driving a shot off Casey that
careened between the slots and
found Ronnie Francis’ lunging
stick, which quickly ﬂung the
biscuit past the out-of-position
Casey.

Then it was Mario’s turn, as he
shoved a nifty pass from Marc
Recchi past Casey who was again
left motionless and lost in the
crease. The Pens came out
determined early and inﬂicted
enough damage during this three-
minute stretch to hold on for a
tough win.

Dave Gagner got Minnesota
back into the game with some
great effort‘ along the boards.
Then he found himself alone in

front of the net with the puck ‘

which Tommy Barrasso never
had a chance to stop. But Brian
Trottier got the eventual game-
winner as he tucked a Bob Errey
rebound shot past (guess who?) a
sprawled-out Casey, who decided
to make ice angels while he was
on his back. A I '

Minnesota came back as they I

gained momentum from a penalty
kill then used their favorite ally,
the power play to cut the Penguin
lead to two goals. Brian Propp
got the goal off the pretty passing

stick of Gagner, as Minnesota
broke out three-on—two and
utilized a perfect weave to re-
ignite the building.

Referee Andy Van Hellemond
started to play favorites,
penalizing the Penguins two times
in a row and offering the North
Stars a lock and key to the game
in the form of a ﬁve—on-three
advantage. Minnesota cashed in
as Mike Modano ﬁred a wicked
slap shot over Barrasso’s right
shoulder and Minnesota was back
in business, down a goal at 4-3.

Fortunately, that was all the
scoring that the North Stars would
do for the evening, thanks to

Barrasso, who slammed the door .

and held bankrupt cards in front
of the North Star attackers,
particularly Neal Broten who
Barrasso denied time and" time
again in the third period. (Maybe
Neal should talk to Phil Rizzuto.)

The North Stars were handed
their business cards again late in
the third period, when Troy Loney
took a five-minute major and
game-misconduct’ penalty for
poking Mark T inordi in the face
with his ‘stick.

But Pittsburgh responded by
playing its best hockey of the

' night, holding Minnesota shotless

during the crucial power play
and leaving the Met Centre dead
even. The Pens forced the series

‘ to" a definite sixth, game and placed _

the entire season in an emotional
three-game pouch.

» Minnesota is a scrappy, physical
team that seems to be giving the
Pens defense ﬁts at times. Often
the defense has been scrambled

J Pens even Stanley finals at 2 with 5-3 win

and out of position for stretches
in a game. The defense has been
vulnerable, but Barrasso has been

exceptional (except for the first 8

game). The North Stars have
speed and like to burn to the
outside and center the puck in
front of the net, where they look
to use their size and finesse to get
chippy goals.

Minnesota has an impressive
array of scoring, though, as was

shown by the three goals they,

scored last night. (Granted, two
were power-play tallies.) Gagner

scored in front of the net, Propp‘

scored after some nifty passing
and skating, and Modano let a
60-foot blast ﬂy free. They can
score in a lot of different ways
and fashions, but black and gold
is in style.

Pittsburgh has grown like no
team I have ever witnessed —
from a choker attitude to a
determined bring—it-\on aura.
Pittsburgh continues to overcome
tremendous obstacles along its
way to the Grail.

Last night the Pens killed off
their toughest challenge by
quelling the North Stars home-
ice advantage and a late five-
minute power play. It is obvious

that the Pens are not going to win.

the cup without Lemieux. He
commands too much attention at
all times and is passing thepuck
like the Lemieux of old.

history — all in the merry, berry
month of May.

NBA championships coala’ pit Magic against Michael  

By Michael Milliron
Staff Writer _

The NBA is now conducting its own
version of the NCAA Final Four. In the
Eastern Conference the much-awaited
rematch of the Chicago Bulls and the two-
time defending champion Detroit Pistons
returns, while the Portland Trailblazers
have to overcome their old nemesis, the
Los Angeles Lakers, to get back to the
finals in the West.

It is not surprising that these four teams
are left. Portland (63-19) had the best
record in the NBA this year, and Chicago
(61-21) had the best record in the East. The
Lakers have lost only one playoff game (a
one-point setback to Golden State), and
Detroit’s savvy and experience have carried
them this far.

Portland runs a blistering transition game
like the Lakers of the mid-'80s and may
play better defense than that dynasty.
Chicago has emphasized the defense which
has earned the Pistons two straight
championship rings.

The Portland Trailblazers have virtually
no weaknesses. They run, score inside,

score outside, rebound and can ‘play.

multiple defenses forcing turnovers
because of their outstanding athleticism.

Their entire roster can play in the NBA,

right down to the 12th man, Wayne Cooper.
Clyde Drexler belongs among the league's
marquee names. He has been unstoppable
in the playoffs, averaging 22.4 ppg, 8.2
rebounds and 8.6 assists.

.-5-.-.~.v v

..;El.}§..I£.e15l‘21?5S?£§.7...-El1%!.{!£l9“S*“P$9.-.. .. While .=he.¥ekers ereeet as deep as the Armstrong and" Craig Hodges, forward

win if they want it. Whether they want it
bad enough is the question here. While
they run off scoring spurts of 10 to 15
points, they are also just as likely to give
up 10 to 15 quick points by the opposition.

The Seattle Supersonics were able to
come back against leads and pushed the
Blazers to five games in round one. They
seem to have a real disdain for the half-
court offense at times, and that often spells
doom in the playoffs. Terry Porter (18.7
ppg, 6.4 assists) is one of the better point
guards in the league and loves taking
shots with the game on the line.

Center Kevin Duckworth is capable of
big things at center but does not consistently
produce. Their bench is the league's
deepest, led by veteran Danny Ainge and
UConn graduate Cliff Robinson.

Many thought the Los Angeles Lakers
would be in a transition year, considering
their lack of playoff success lastyear. They
had a new coach in Mike Dunleavy and
two new players in forward Sam Perkins
and guard Terry Teagle. Things appeared
that way, too. Early in the season, the
Lakers started out 2-5. They were not
where they wanted .to be. Now they are.
The Lakers have the role of underdog in
the Western finals.

Dunleavy has made some changes. He
went from “showtime” to “slowtime” and
has stressed team defense. Instead of a
bushel of fast—break baskets, the Lakers
post you to death in the half-court offense
with Perkins, MagicJohnson,James Worthy
and Teagle.

Blazers, they have the horses to win this
race. Magic (24.6 ppg, 8.3 rebounds, 12.8
assists) is, well, Magic. Worthy (23.8 ppg)
and Perkins (18.5 ppg, 8.8 rebounds) are

post-up weapons and more than capable 8

defenders. Guard Byron Scott is shooting
61 percent from the three-point line in the
playoffs.

Off the bench, A.C. Green is an active
rebounder, and Teagle is a pure scorer.
The emergence of rookie forward/center
Elden Campbell could be a big factor
before this series is over.

' Everything on the court points to a
Portland victory, but they do give teams
chances to win. Seattle and Utah did not
take advantage of their opportunities. Magic
Johnson will. The Lakersin six. .

Michael and the Chicago Bulls have
been saying all season how they want to
go through Detroit to get to the finals. As
Detroit’s hobbled Isiah Thomas said,
“They’ve got us.” The Pistons have
dispatched the Bulls three straight years.
Chicago feels that this is finally its year.

Perhaps for the first time, the Chicago
Bulls are the Chicago Bulls and not the
Chicago Jordans. MVP Michael is still the
man, but he has more help than ever
before. Despite not making a return trip to
the all-star game this year, forward Scottie
Pippen is having an outstanding playoff
for a change.

The Bulls are also just a shade below the
Pistons in team defense, but they are
younger and more athletic. Chicago even
sports a bench these days with guards B.J.

Cliff Levingston and center Will Perdue. .
Two-time defending champion Detroit
must have all its pistons firing to have a
chance at beating a Motivated Michael and
Co. That is not to say that they cannot, as
they showed great heart, determination
and pride against Atlanta and Boston.

Employing the “Jordan Rules” is no
longer a guaranteed way of stopping the
Bulls. The Pistons will have to play some
great individual defense against some of
the Bulls’ other players.

How well Defensive Player of the Year
Dennis Rodman handles Pippen will be
paramount in this series. Also, guard Joe
Dumars cannot expend all his energy
guarding Michael. With Isiah’s injuries,
Dumars must contribute more‘ offensively.

The inside-outside scoring combo of
center Laimbeer and forward James
Edwards will give Cartwright and Grant all
they can handle. The Piston bench has
been firing on all cylinders. Microwave
Vinnie Johnson has been hot, and forward
Mark Aguirre has been shooting like he
did at Reunion Arena (when with the
Dallas Mavericks) in the mid-’80s. Forward
John Salley has been blocking shots and
playing defense. .

This series is going to come down to
Isiah’s health and to who plays better
defense without being ejected for it. The

Pistons will not win this series by Isiah

. banking in three-pointers. The Bulls in

seven. Michael gets a shot at Magic and
his first NBA Championship, and NBC gets
a ratings coup in itsfirst year covering the
NBA.
