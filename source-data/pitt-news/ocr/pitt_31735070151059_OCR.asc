Sports stadiums across the world
have become monuments to cor-
porate welfare, a Pitt guest speaker
said yesterday afternoon.

More than 50 students and
guests ﬁled into Room 324 in the
Cathedral yesterday at 5:30 p.m.
to hear Pitt’s Global Studies Center
guest Dave Zirin, sports editor for
The Nation magazine, talk about
the hidden costs of sports at home
and internationally, from the Con-
sol Energy Center in Pittsburgh to
the Olympics.

According to Zirin, stadiums
are bad public investments. He
thinks the economic-activity they
generate doesn’t cover the cost to
the taxpayer, and he worries that
the government subsidizes local
sports teams instead of building in-

frastructure that will serve the city. .

He pointed to the Washington
Nationals’ baseball park as an ex-
ample of this confused prioritizing.

Within a year of Nationals Park
opening its gates with the help of
taxpayers’ dollars, Zirin said, faulty
metro systems allegedly caused
the deaths of nine commuters. The
accident Zirin referred to occurred
onjune 22, 2009, when two south-
bound trains on the city’s redline
track collided head-on. The acci-
dent occurred after signals failed
to indicate where a train was lo-
cated on a track. The section.where
the collision occurred had been
installed just ﬁve days earlier. Zi-
rin said taxpayer-funding could’ve

SGB members split on Hillel allocation

Mahita Gaj anan
Staﬁ' Writer

A student organization alloca-
tions request sparked disagree-
ment between Student Govern-
ment Board members this week
over whether historical prece-
dent should determine student
group allocations for the current
fiscal year.

At Tuesday’s weekly~public
SGB meeting in Nordy’s Place, the
Hillel Jewish University Center
presented a request for $13,509
for honorarium, airfare, ground

transportation andlodging for a
two—day event planned for March
28, featuring speaker A.]. Jacobs,
author of the nonﬁction work
“The Year of Living Biblically.”
After several minutes of debate,

the Board approved $8,794.60‘

and denied $4,714.60 in line with
the Allocations Committee’s rec-
ommendation. . B
Each week at its public meet-
ing, SGB hears requests from stu-
dent groups requesting money
from the Student Activities Fund,
a $2.3 million fund to which all
non-College of General Studies

{:

Pitt undergraduates contribute-
$80 each semester through the
Student Activities Fee. The SGB
Allocations Committee meets

each week before the public

meeting at Nordy’s to prepare
a funding recommendation to
submit to the Board along with
each allocations request from a
student group. ‘
Although the Board ultimately
approved the allocation for Hil-
lel in part, its final vote on the°
request was split evenly. Board
members Sowmya Sanapala, C]
Bonge,John Cordier and Thomas

Jabro voted to fund theevent and
Michael N ites, Amelia Brause,
Sarah Winston and David Rosen-
thal voted to deny funding in full.
Board President Gordon Loud-

erback broke thetie by voting in V

favor of the recommendation.
Although the Board handled
the request for the Hillel Jewish

University Ceriter’s event along .

with the 15 other allocatioris re-
quests Tuesday, the ﬁnal approv-
al of the funding raised doubts
among some Board members.

Nites, who was the Allocations Commit-

tee chair before becoming a Board member, '

expressed that the amount of money al-
located to the event was unusual.

“It’s just a lot of money for one group
to get on one event, and it’s not something
that we can do for all organizations out
there,” he said. "

Typically, the Allocations Committee
bases its funding for events onthe cost of
similar events from previous years. These
precedents, however, aren’t official, and
the committee can decide to provide more
funding if it chooses to do so. There is no
established limit to the amount of funding
a group can be allocated for speakers, and
the Board’ can overrule the Allocations
Committee’s request if it so chooses.

While he recognized the importance
of supporting Hillel, Nites was wary of
the steep increase in funds Hillel received
Tuesday. .

According to Nites and current Allo-
cations Chairman Alex Majchrzak, Hillel
received a total of $3,882.64 in the last
ﬁscal year (fall 2011 to spring 2012). Before

. Tuesday, Hillel had already received $4,552

in allocations for the 2013 ﬁscal year (fall
2012 to spring 2013), $180 of which went
toward a conference and $3400 to host
speaker Scott Freed. Majchrzak said he
didn’t have information about the remain-
ing ﬁgures available at the time he spoke
to reporters. Including the funding from

Tuesday, Hillel has so far received a total ..
of $13,346.60 from the Student Activities .

Fund in the 2013 ﬁscal year, more than
tripling the group’s budget from last year.
Majchrzak said that Allocations Com-

mittee members decided that the value -

of the event warranted the extra funding
because it was expected to attract more
than 200 students. He also said ]acob’s
message was one that could be potentially
beneﬁcial for a large number of students
on Pitt’s campus. ‘
The members who approved the request

said special circumstances can, in certain '_

cases, inﬂuence an organization’s°level of
funding. 2 .

“There are years where there is volatil-
ity in organizations’ budgets,” Jabro said.
“Sometimes boards will just decide that
an organization’s programming merits
funding.”

Although, according to Louderback,
there is no set rule requiring SGB to stick
to a student group’s previous year’s bud-
get, Nites said that with the number of
groups asking for money, the Board and
Allocations Committee generally tries to

keep student groups at the same level of
funding each year.
Rosenthal expressed similar thinking.

“I was uncomfortable giving them that
much money for a program given how
much money they had received histori-
cally in the past;” he said. . _

Part of his hesitation to vote in favor
of granting the funding was based on his
experiences on the Allocations Committee,
which he said tends to be more conserva-
tive in its decisions than the Board itself.

According to Nites, the justiﬁcation
to fund the event came from Board mem-
bers who were looking at howbeneﬁcial
the event would be instead of considering

-the cost.

According to Hillel President Michael
Finge_rman,_]acobs is a high-caliber speaker
who carries a high speaking fee. In “The

Year of Living Bibli'cally,”]acobs discusses ‘

how he lived an entire year adhering strict-
ly to the moral codes of the Bible.

Fingerman hopes that the event will
reach at least 350 people, and he plans to
collaborate with other religiously affiliated
groups on campus such as the Muslim Stu-
dent Association and the Newman Center,
a Catholic ministry center, to present the
event. - '

“We are an expanding organization, and
as we are expanding, we are requesting
more funds so we can meet our mission of
extending to the community,” Fingerman
said Tuesday. ‘

Nites explained that a group’s level of
funding ﬂuctuates with its success on cam-
pus. Traditionally, he ‘said, SGB funding

for a group increases as the group grows,
. as long as the group demonstrates a need

for increase in funding.

Although he voted to deny Hillel’s re-
quest, Rosenthal said he was not surprised
that the Board chose to fund the group de-
spite the precedent for maintaining steady
levels of funding between years.

“We’d have-to weigh how much they’re
collaborating with other groups and how"
much fundraising they would do other than
with SGB,” Rosenthal said. “It’s a case-by-
case analysis.”  :2-

_ In this case, Cordier, who voted to fund
the event, said that Hillel fulﬁlled the cri-
teria he looked for when student groups
came in to request money. For Cordier, the
quality of an event, the beneﬁt it would
have for the student body and the amount
of time in which an organization can pull
off the event are the most important crite-

ria in deciding whether to fund it. Though '

gone toward improving valuable infrastruc-
ture such as the metro system instead of
ﬁmding the new stadium.

“These are real choices politicians make,
and it’s gotten even more acute over the last
ﬁve years.” '

Zirin said that in a_ post-recession Ameri-
ca, sports organizations continue to threaten
cash—strapped states with taking teams else-
where if they don’t provide public funding
for new stadiums. Most recently, the Sac-
ramento Kings of the NBA_have incurred a
bidding war between Sacramento and Seattle
over who can offer the team a better deal.

The Maloof family, which owns the Kings,

. reached an agreement to sell the controlling

interest of the NBA franchise to a Seattle-
based group that has pledged to move the
team to its home city. The Kings franchise
"would ﬁll the void left after the Seattle Su-
personics departed for Oklahoma City in
2008. According to E-SPN.com, the Kings
franchise is valued at $525 million.
 Senior marketing major Bryan Szczur
said Zirin’s points hit closeto home.
A Johnstown native and lifelong Pitts-

burgh sports fan intending to go into sports "

marketing, Szczur wore a Pirates shirt to the
talk and hadno idea of the politics behind the

sports he loves before attending the event. ‘

.“It was eye opening,” he said. “I’ll still
watch, like any other fan, but [Zirin’s points]
will deﬁnitely stick in the back of my mind.”

According to Zirin, out of control spend-

Bave Zirin talked about the dangers of public financing for stadiums. Andy Slepman / For

ing on sports is not just an American_prob-
lem. ‘ A .

He said that China displaced millions
of people while erecting facilities for the

A Summer Olympics in 2008. According to the

Geneva, Switzerland-based Center on Hous-
ing Rights and Evictions, China displaced 1.5

.million people during the preparation stages

for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.

And while Vancouver spent millions ﬂy-
ing in snow from northern Canada for the
2010 Winter Olympics, the government also
cut physical educationfrom public schools
across British Columbia.

Most recently, Zirin accused Rio De]anei-
ro, Brazil, of-using the upcomingeolympics
and World Cup games to displace the city’s
poorest inhabitants, famous for living in the
favelas on the surrounding mountainsides.
According to an article in The New York
Times, an estimated 170,000 people could
be displaced as a result ofdevelopment sur-
rounding the two sporting events.

“I think that part of how we articulate a

movement against this.needs to be about

articulating a movement to not reject sports
or reject the Olympics or the World Cup, but
to reclaim it,” he said. 2'

Chelsea Vecchiarelli, who graduated from
Pitt in December, said she had no idea events
such as the World Cup and the Olympics took

he initially thought he would vote against
funding the event, Cordier said that af-
ter hearing Hillel representatives present
their side of the story at the public meet—
ing, he changed his mind.

The high attendance expectationsfor
the event and Hi1lel’s plans to include-
other student groups in the presentation
prompted Codier to vote in favor of the
allocation. -

Despite their assertion of the impor-
tance of case-by-case analyses of each
student group’s requests, both Rosenthal
and Nites said they worried about setting
a dangerous precedent when it comes to

other student groups requesting money.

“I know it’s something we cannot do
for everybody,” Nites said.

However, according to Louderback, it
is dangerous to compare student groups
because every request is different; and
the decision on each allocations request
depends on what exactly the group is re-
questing. For both Louderback andjabro,
it seems there is no point in rejecting pro-

gramming simply because it would poten- V

tially increase an organization’s budget.

“Just because one organization gets one
thing doesn’t mean another one is entitled

Louderback noted a potential downside
of adhering to the rules of precedent when
it comes to reqests for Student Activities
Fund allocations.

“I neve_r want to stop a club from doing
a new program or a good program or a
large program based on the fact that we are
basing it from last year,” Louderback said.

lation. Vecchiarelli graduated with a Spanish
language degree and a minor in Portuguese.

‘ She now works at Cameroon Football Devel-

opment Program, an organization designed
to channel youth enthusiasm for soccer into
sustainable health and social development.
It has an office in East Liberty.

Considering her job and her plans to move
back to Brazil, Vecchiarelli said Zirin’s talk
seemed tailored to her personally.

“[Zirin’s] comments opened up howl see
the role I can play in global sport develop-
ment,” she said. “I love what sports can do,
but I never thought about the darker side 
the history,_politics and money that drives
construction.”

Veronica Dristas, the assistant director of _

outreach for Pitt’s Global Studies Center, said
getting students to think about the sports
they love was exactly the idea behind asking
Zirin to speak.

“When you go to the next sporting event,
think about this,” she said. “What can you do
beyond being a fan?” a -

    Losing our religion?

By The Pitt News Opinions Staff

A report last year from The Pew Forum on Religion £5’ Public Life shows that members of the Mil-

lenial Generation;—- those born between the years of 1980 and 2000‘ —— are declaring them— ‘
selves religiously unaﬂiliated in record numbers. In light of this information, The Pitt News ’
talked to a cross—section of religious and secular leaders on campus to ask them how religion

and spirtuality continues to inﬂuence student life and how they believe this generation will con-

tinue evolving in its relationship with organized religion. :

Josh Phillips

Pitt’s Secular Student Alliance,
a_ group that brings together athe-
ists, agnostics, skeptics and non-
religious people.

The Pitt News: What are the mo— '

tivations and goals of the Secular Al-
liance?

Josh Phillips:~We’re sort of split. As
a social group, were there to discuss
re ' 'ous issues in afriendly environ-
ment. As a political group, we promote
various church and state—related is-
sues, and we’ve done some support
for some other groups.

TPN: Does Pitt’s Secular Alliance .

ﬁmction similarly to secular groups
on other campuses?
JP: From a cultural standpoint, Pitt
V isn’tadeeply religious campus. In alot
of places in the South, [atheists] have
aculturewarto ﬁght. Here most of the
students [here] are secular. ‘

TPN: Do you think it’s harder to -

be nonreligious or religious at Pitt?

JP: At Pitt, I don’t think there’s re-
allyadifference. There are alot ofboth
religious and nonreligious people.
Universities in general probably dif-
fer by place.

TPN: Do you think that religious
belief is dangerous? ‘ I

JP": I don’t know if I’d go with dan-
gerous, but it points to certain weird
thought patterns. There are a lot of
‘places culturally Where we interject
religious stuff that is rather incoher-

that God inﬂuences the Super Bowl.
However, many people who claim that
they believe these things will back
down if their beliefs are confronted.
TPN: We’re wondering what you

. think about religion’s interaction with

public life. For example, do.you con-
sider symbols such as Christmas trees
to be a religious symbols?

JP: They deﬁnitely reference Chris-
tianity in someway. However; people
respond to themin away thatis much

-more secular than anything else.
TPN: What do youthink about the‘

data that shows that more-religious
countries have lower suicide rates?
JP: An interesting counterpoint

O to that is that less religious countries

have a lower homicide rate, so that’s
interesting. I’m not exactly sure what
the statistical correlations are, but
I don’t think people suddenly freak
out and jump off cliffs when they lose
their religion.
4 TPN: Can you deny that religious

‘ that 27 percent of Americans think .

TPN: The New York Times re-
cently wrote a story about an “atheist
churc ” in London, where members
get together and give motivational
speeches and sing songs together
but without the context of religion.
So do you think then that, if religion
fosters social cohesion and positive
vibes, could other similar institutions
replace religion? I
JP: Fromwhatl know ofthatproj-
ect, I don’t necessarily agree with it.

if The founders of this church seemed

a

experiences created forces of good in '

society? For example, the Civil Rights '

Movement has some roots in religious
thought.
JP: Religion is not the only reason

_people cared aboutcertain societal is-

sues. For example, therewere famous
abolitionists who were religious.
However,therewere deﬁnitelypeople
who were promotingslavery based on
religious doctrine. There were also

people supporting segregation onthe ‘

like they were trying to be pro—mys—

ticism and like they were trying to ,

make things overly spiritual. [The
atheist church] was trying a little too
hard to make a church with a different
theme, instead of making a different
kind of temple. Social support isn’t
something that we have just because
we purport to have certain religious

' beliefs. Book clubs could do as aforrn

of social support. ,

TPN: Do you reallythinkthat read-
ing “Huckleberry Finn” wouldﬁllthe
same hole inlife thatbelievinginGod
does? S . -

JP: Well, not just “Huckleberry
Finn.” Actually, yes though, because
a lot of stuff people are looking for

. —— social support, understanding of
the world, a chance to talk and share

experiences —. I do think there’s a

groups do that in a more conservative Christian
climate, and some are more liberal. Our goal is to
create these communities and to nurture people

V already in those communities. Another goal of

to hang out. People canform their own groups .

to do what they want. .

TPN: Do you see religion itselfas a problem,
or incorrect interpretations of religions? '

JP: I do thinkthat, ultimately, religious belief

Lis very deeply ﬂawed because it’s based on the

idea that you can just know  based on
feeling them very strongly, which is the idea of
faith. And part of the problem is thatwe tend to
view the more moderate churches as the ‘freal”
churches and the more extreme ones are the
ones we don’t like. It’s hard for me to say that
religious belief itself isn’t the problem. Some
people are religious and never do anythingbad,
and some people do‘very good things out of
religious belief. '

campus? '

. Michael Van Ness: It’s difficult to be religious
at Pitt because it’s avery, very secular university.
The impression I get as a Christian on campus
is that it’s not like a university in the Bible belt
where everyone is just a de facto Christian.

TPN: Whathasyourexperience as achristian
leader on Pitt’s campus been like? .

MVN: I can’t speak for the whole Christian
community. No one person can speak for the
whole Christian_community. The whole goal of

' most Christian student organizations is to draw

people into this fellowship of love, of compas-
sion, ofjesus, of God and to be a loving com‘-
munity that wants to build each other up. Some

 
   

l<r:iiny Olltl l Visilal Editor‘

most organizations is to reach people who are

poor, who aren’t cared for and who are kind of i

on the fringes of society.

TPN: Why do you think Pitt is such a secular
institution? _

MVN: A lot of students who are liberal-lean-
ing come to Pitt. Our generation’s mindset tends
to be, “I don’t want to impose my values on you,
you don’t impose your values on me, and we’ll
all exist together.” I think this mindset is not
necessarily conducive to having strong beliefs,

- which is important for people who take their

faith extremely seriously.
. TPN: So you’re arguing that.people aren’t
takingaﬁrm enough stance, regardless of their
religion?

MVN: What I’ve noticed from the clubs I’m
associated with is that people in my parents’
generation are more likely to say that tl1ere’s
a right and a wrong. We’re, much less likely to
be black and white, and it’s harder to cultivate
a strong faith when you don’t view things, like
the existence of God, as super black and white.

TPN: How do you deﬁne Christian, for clari-
ﬁcation?

MVN: Christian literally means Christ—fol-
Iower. I-think most people in campus organi-

zations would agree with this deﬁnition. Being ‘

Christian means trying to model your life after
Jesus. It means valuingthings like relationships

and not putting a value on social  It’s I ,

more than just going to church.

TPN: Do youthinkthat there are some Chris-
tians who are just blindly going through the
world based on faith? ‘

MVN: Ibelieve infaith, butfaith means some-
thing different to me. Faith doesn’t mean that

P we shouldn’tfbelieve in science, for example.

: It’s diffi‘cult to
be religious at ,
Pitt because _
it’s a _very, very
secular university.

Michael Van Ness

And when, for example, I choose to believe in
evolution, I believe in it based on someone else’s
research, writing and presentations. And that
is in some sense a leap of faith — faith based
on empirical, rational evidence. And I think
that you can do that with Christianity. So you’re
makinga jump, but it’s a jump based on evidence
from a text I believe to be authoritative and from
observations of the world around me.

TPN: So you see the United States as secular-
izing. Do you see that as a bad thing?

MVN: I see Americaas polarizing more and
more. ‘

' TPN: What are the origins of that?

MVN: I want to make the point again that I

dorft speak for everyone. But I think that we’ve

and justice and interpreting them in the way that
we think the Founding Fathers intended that
we don’t have empathy for what other people

on the fact that you’re allowed to be different

multiple allowable views.

AlaaMohamed: There are all different types

TPN: How do you feel about Christmas trees

questioning what religion they want to be. On

the other hand, Iwas brought up in atraditional

nowadays Muslims have to work twice as hard
to show what we really stand for, and education
is a big part of MSA’S goal. The solution to these
problems is education — lack of education is

what causes these misunderstandings. Getting .

. TPN: We wanted to talk a little bit about the

separation of church and state. In the William:

Pitt Union, there’s a room reserved for Muslim
students so they can pray on campus. Given
that this is a public research university, do you
see thatas aconﬂict? '

AM: I don’t, because it’s a public university,
as you said, but the prayer room is there for
students who go here so that they can live and
study here. We reserve rooms for events, so
prayer is kind of like another event. We’re just
like any other public organization.

TPN: When Richard Dawkins or Christopher

Ellie PetroS.|<.y 1

AM: It’s goingto bugme personally because
thatpoint ofviewisaboutbeinginyourface. But
I don’t care what people do with their lives as
long as it doesn’t negatively affect me.‘ So if they
go around telling people that religion is wrong,
then I have to educate people about why we
should be allowed to practice our religion freely.
I thinktheir mindset is that theywill refute any
evidence about why religion could be a good

everyone should have the freedom to choose

When the Pitt men’s basketball
team squares off against St.
John’s on Sunday, it will do so
in ad matchup of teams tied for
fourth in the Big East conference
as the regular season hurtles into
its ﬁnal set of games.

The No. 20 Panthers (20-7,
8-6 Big East) desperately need
a win against the Red Storm
(16-10, 8-6) at Madison Square

Garden this weekend, with only —
1 four games remaining on Pitt’s
‘ schedule — four games that hold

immeasurable weight in deter-
mining Pitt’s position in the Big
Eastand in the NCAA Tourna-

two-consecutive losses to No.

Dame and must stop the bleeding
before any real damage is done to
its postseason aspirations.

The contest between Pitt and
St. John’s follows arguably Pitt’s
worst performance of the season,
in which the Panthers blew a 19-3
lead to Notre Dame, eventually
succumbing to the Irish 51-42.

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

February 22, 20W 8 I The Pitt News l vvvvvv.pittnevvs.cem

As tournament nears, 3 tied
at top of conference again

Nate Barnes
Senior Stqff I/Vriter

With the Big East schedule barreling down the
stretch toward the conference tournament, the
upper echelon ofthe league is beginning to sort
itself out, and who will earn a top-four ﬁnish
and a double-bye at Madison Square Garden
is becoming more apparent. 7
Right now, Georgetown,‘ Marquette and
Syracuse maintain a triumvirate at the top of

- the standings.

Pitt faced a tough stretch lately and receded
into the middle of the pack after a hot streak

through which the team won seven of eight-

and nearly broke into the conference? lead.

1. No. 8 Syracuse (22-4, 10-3 Big East)

Syracuse stays at the top of the rankings
for another week, having rebounded from
an upset loss to Connecticut last week with
victories over Seton Hall and Providence. Al-
though these are teams Syracuse was expected
to defeat, the Orange still took care of business

— against the Pirates and a hot Providence squad.

2. No. 11 Georgetown (20-41, 10-3) .

With an eight—game winning streak, the
Hoyas have risen to the top of the confer-
ence, and no team has beenhotter of late than
Georgetown. It has a chance to take sole pos-

session of ﬁrst place Saturday with its biggest ,

test of the season on the road against rival
Syracuse. ‘ _
3. No. 17 Marquette (19-6, 19-3)

, oach John Thompson III has helped Georgetown find its recent groove. MC Campus

After a loss to Georgetown, the Golden
Eagles rebounded with vigor by running Pitt
off the ﬂoor for a second time this season. On
Monday, Buzz Williams’ team receives its only
shot at the conference’s heavyweight when
Syracuse visits the Bradley Center, where Mar-
quette has won 23 games in a row.

4. No. 10 Louisville (21-5, 9-4) '_

’ ‘It seems many have forgotten about the _
Cardinals, but Louisville appears to have re- ‘

gained its form by winning ﬁve of six since

dropping three games in a row. The Cardinals"

have a shot to make up the one game by which
they trail the conference leaders with an easy
schedule before a rematch against Syracuse
on March 2.

5. No. 25 Notre Dame (21-6, 9-5)

The Fighting Irish rebounded from an atro-
cious loss against Providence with an emphatic
win in Pittsburgh on Monday. The Irish are just

- 1 1/2 games out of ﬁrst-place and could score a

double-bye "depending on how badly the top
teams beat each other up in these ﬁnal four
or ﬁve games. _

6. No. 20 Pittsburgh (20-7, 8-6)

Pitt had a week to forget, losing badly to
Marquette and Notre Dame. Hopefully, the
Panthers can move on quickly because Pitt will
likely need to win all of its remaining games if it
wants a decent seed in the NCAA Tournament.

7. Villanova (17-10, 8-6)

selﬁshly we played tonight, and it resulted

in a loss.”

\ On Sunday, Pitt will need to get back to
playing as it usually does with a founda-
tion set in the fundamentals of success-
ful basketball —— executing good shots,
rebounding and defending. This is the
style head coachjamie Dixon stresses day
in and day out with his team.

“I think it’s pretty obvious what we’ve

gotta do, what we’ve gotta get better at,”
Dixon said. “The rebounding thing is
pretty obvious, when we out-rebound op-
ponents [is] when we put ourselves in the
toughest position [to be beaten] .”

On Monday, Notre Dame out-rebound-
ed the Panthers by 15, 40-25 —— the worst
any team has beaten Pitt on the boards this
season. Overall, Pitt is one of the nation’s
best teams when it comes to rebounding,
as the Panthers average a margin of 7.4

rebounds over their opponents.
Part of rebounding better will come as

. a byproduct of playing more physically on

the ﬂoor, according to'forward_].J. Moore.
Playing this way is also a crucial step to-
ward neutralizing the effectiveness of the
Red Storm’s front line. .

“We have to look out for Sir’Dominic

Pointer. He goes to the boards. He had
10 rebounds against South Florida last
[Wednesday]. Jakarr Sampson,‘ he re-

bounds the ball really [well], and their big.

man [Chris Obekpa], he leads the nation
in shot—blocking,” Moore said. “We just
gotta be more physical and go out there
and play hard.”

Offensively, the issue of playing self-
ishly as Woodall detailed Monday resulted

from players passing up good looks at

BIG EAST (

Villanova has proven it can beat top teams
W“ this season and has more chances to do so with
three of the Wildcats’ ﬁnal four games coming
against opponents ranked higher than them
in the Big East standings. Nova won four of
its last ﬁve and might have momentum in its
favor as it begins a strenuous run.
a... 8. St.]ohn’s (16-10, 8-6)

‘ The Red Storm had agolden opportunity to
establish its conference legitimacy with back-
to-back games against Syracuse and Louisville,
but the team lost both games. On Sunday, St.

_]ohn’s has another opporti_mity_when the Pan-
thers visit the Red Storm in Madison Square

Garden. The teams are tied in the standings.
9. Connecticut (17-7, 7-5)
The Huskies are ineligible for postseason
play in 2013, but they don’t seem to use that
as an excuse to consider this a wasted season.

Led by one of the nation’s best backcourts, '

consisting of Shabazz Napier, Ryan Boatright
and Omar Calhoun, Kevin Ollie’s squad is in

-the thick of the conference and primed for a

strong season next year.
10. Cincinnati (19-7, 7-6)
Cincinnati continues to slide, having lost

three of its last four.- The Bearcats need a strong

ﬁnish in their ﬁnal ﬁve games, whichwill be no
easy task with two matchups against UConn

and trips to Notre Dame and Louisville ahead.

11. Providence (14-12, 6-8)

The Friars reeled off four-straight wins
to rise from the basement of the conference,
securing triumphs over Notre Dame and Cin-
cinnati, but a trip to Syracuse put an end to
Providence’s stretch of success.

12. DePaul (11-15, 2-11) .

The Blue Demons managed to vault out of
last place in the rankings this week by win-
ning a game against‘ a fellow" doormat, the
Scarlet Knights from Piscataway, NJ. DePaul
followed up with a 24-point embarrassment
at the hands of Georgetown. ‘

13. Rutgers (13-12, 4-10) .

All that really needs to be said here is that
Rutgers lost to DePaul. I know Rutgers is Rut-
gers, but seriously  DePaul? Shame on" you,
Rutgers. '

14. Seton Hall (13-14, 2-12)

Losers of eight-consecutive games, the Pi-
rates have plundered nothing this season and
only serve as a punching bagfor the rest of the

A conference. One has to feel just the slightest
bit of sympathy for Fuquan Edwin, who’s put- ’

ting up stellar averages of 17.1 points and 5.7
rebounds per game to no avail.

15. South Florida (10-16, 1-13)

The only team with a longer losing skid
than Seton Hall, the Bulls have lost nine in
a row with no end in sight. Even worse, USF
hasn’t really come close to winning a game
since an overtime loss to UCo'nn onFeb. 3.
It’s amazing to think this team somehow beat
Georgetown this season. I

the basket for tougher, ‘contested shots.

Among those players is Moore, who said

Pitt “definitely” passed up good looks, at
5

“I hold myself ‘accountable for that. I
passed up some real good shots,” Moore
said. ‘ ' - .

Shot selection will also be key for Dix-
on. It is something he mentioned Thursday
despite his tendency toward the conversa-
tion topics ‘of defense.and rebounding.

“Shot selection, just one area of it is
something that is a constant challenge,
and it’s never something that is safe
and perfect. There’s always going ‘to be,
I wouldn’t say adjustments, but you’ve
gotta continually guide and watch it,”
Dixon said. “We gotta take good shots.
.That’s what we’ve done-and what we’ve
always done,‘ and our offensive numbers
indicate that.”

As a result of players passing up so
many open shots — most of those on the
perimeter —-— Pitt made no 3—pointe_rs Mon-
day for the second time this season. Both
games ended in a loss for Pitt. Do not be
surprised to see Pitt let open looks from
beyond the arc ﬂy Sunday afternoon in

’ New York City.‘ ' - ‘

' The Red Storm come off a 15-point vic-
tory over USF after losing back—to—back
games against Syracuse and Louisville.
D’Angelo Harrison leads St._]ohn’s in ‘scor-
ing at 18.3 points per game, the third-best
mark in the Big East. “I think transition

3 offense,” Dixon sa_id,i_n regard to what St.‘
' ]ohn’s does well. “Anyone that rebounds .

well can take it downthe court and so
they- have the ability’ to get ﬁve guys out

in transition.” ' *

Even with fouriinportant games ap-

_ proaching, Dixon is only focused on the

game directly in front of the Panthers.
“We’ve talked about there being four
games left, but our focus is on our next one
and playing our best basketball. We’ve got
to take care of business against St.John’s,

who’s obviously playing very well,” Dixon -

said. “We can’t focus on the four [games
remaining]. We’ve gotta focus on the one
[Sunday] right now.” I
