Pittsburgh Celebrates... 'WeAre The No. ‘I Family’.

Pitt News Staff Writer

As far as Pitt dorm resjdents
were concerned, there was only one A
place to celebrate the Pirates’
World Series victory Wednesday
night—between the Towers and
The‘ Original Hot Dog Shop on
South Bouquet. Within ﬁve
minutes of the ﬁnal out, students
and fans jammed Forbes Avenue,
pounding away at cars, trucks and
PAT buses; by midnight, the street
was closed and traffic completely
re-routed.

Along with the celebration were
several incidents of vandalism and
violence, according to campus
police. Two arrests were made
here: one for assaulting an officer

and another, for disorderly conduct.

Also, a car was overturned on
Forbes. Lt. J im‘Waters called for a
tow truck, but,‘ by the time it
arrived, the car hadbeen turned
right side up again.

“We may have lost a lot of cars.
but we didn’t lose any people.”
Waters said.

Deputy Police Chief Sam Conte,
however. said there was damage to
a police vehicle. _

“There was some vandalism. but
it was sporadic,” Conte said.
”Three tires were slashed on a

police car, and the windshield was _

-broken.”

Presbyterian Hospital reported
six emergency room cases, all
treated and released.

To cope with crowd antics,
campus police doubled its forces
for the series finale.

“There were approximately 20-
25 policemen on duty,” said
Conte. “We knew there was going
to be a lot of people out, and they
weren’t just students, especially
with the downtown area blocked
off.

The official victory celebration is
slated for this afternoon at Market
Square. Pat Ciccone, or the City
Parks and Recreation Department,

wanted to play the unofficial Pirate
theme song, Sister Sledge’s “We
Are Family” at the rally, but so far
has been unable to locate a copy.

“We couldn't find a copy of the
record,” said Ciccone. “You
know. this record went solid gold
(signifying $1 million in sales) in
this area alone. And, you can't
give a Pirate rally without the disco
tune that team captain Willie
Stargell has just about made into
the city’s anthem.” J

Although early wire service
reports indicated that vandalism in
the city overall had reached wide
proportions with some 200 arrests,
in truth, the actual number was
approximately 50, according to the
police superintendant’s ‘office.

But, then, the celebrating has
really just begun, though pre-
cautions are being taken by city
police that those same damages
incurred during the Pirates’ 1971.

Board of Trustees Okays Capital Funds Campaign p

/ By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s Board of Trustees passed a
resolution yesterday authorizing-
the university to implement a
capital fund raising campaign
designed to raise more than $50
million from private corporations
and foundations. ~

The fund raising program will
begin in early 1980 with Chancellor
Posvar meeting with representa-
tives of the private institutions and
will continue throughout the
decade. Later in the year, faculty,
alumni and trustees will become
actively involved in the fund drive,
according to Posvar. '

The funds raised in the campaign
will be used to “meet the goals of
the university as it moves into its
third century of progress,” accord-
ing to the trustees’ resolution.

Posvar said it is hoped the
program will reach its peak when
the university celebrates its bicent-
ennial on Feb. _28, 1987.

“We think this will have a lot of
dramatic appeal,” Posvar added.

Major public relations activity for
the campaign will probably occur

 

said, adding more details of the
program will be announced later in

‘ the year. . '

Posvar announced that the
university is requesting $79.9
million in appropriations from the

state government for fiscal year
1981‘, an 18 percent increase over
last year’s resolution.

Penn State and Temple have
each requested 18 percent and 21
percent

respectively,

the same period last year. In the
area of government-sponsored
projects, the university received
more than $1.1 million more in
fiscal year 1979 than in ﬁscal year
1978.

The trustees also passed a
resolution authorizing the univer-
sity to invest in government or

Assembly Ponders
Copyright Provisions

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Faculty Assembly has
unanimously approved its own
versiov of a proposed copyright
policy, authored by two Senate
standing committees, that differs
from a draft written by the
administration.

Both the university and the
faculty versions of the policy are
designed to conform with a 1978
federal copyright law that gives an
employer such as Pitt the legal
right to own the copyright on any
written. works produced by an
employee.

The university's version of the
copyright. policy, claims both
copyright and ﬁnancial interest on
some works where extensive use of
Pitt.-owned resources is used.

Under the faculty version of the
policy, individual authors will
retain ownership of copyrights
rather than the university, unless
“specified otherwise in a con-
tract.”

“While copyright ownership will
reside in the authors, the university
may, retain a ﬁnancial interest in
any work that involves extensive
utilization of university resources
such as technical production
facilities beyond those normally
assigned to the particular indivi-
duals,” the faculty draft reads.

Professor’ Richard Abrams, who .

co-authored the faculty draft, said
an author should know, in most
cases, what amount of university
resourcesyis needed in his research

before his works are published.
Abrams added that “...an
individual using facilities would

recognize this and enter into a.

contractual
ily.”

A university copyright commit-
tee will act as a referee or appellate
body in cases where an author and
the university cannot agree upon
contractual terms, according to the
faculty’s draft. -

The committee will be composed
of nine members; four will be
appointed by the chancellor and
ﬁve will be appointed by the
university senate president, the
faculty draft reads.

The university proposal states
that analready existing-committee,
the University Patent and Copy-
right Committee, will determine
the amount of Pitt-owned resources
used in all cases and specify what
rights the university has to the
works.

According to the faculty propos-
al, “There shall be no predeter-
mined royalty distribution pattern
for those works in which the
university has aftnancial interest.’ ’

Instead. the royalty distribution
should be determined in each
individual case and be specified in
the contractual agreement, the
faculty proposal says.

agreement voluntar-

The faculty proposal is basically
a’ written statement of the policy
already used by the university,
according to Abrams.

“The intent of this document is
to stay as close as we could to the
current policy, wheter it be de facto
or explicit,”, Abrams said.

World Series Celebration Marked By Vandalism , Arrests  

By CINDY COHEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Two arrests were made‘ in
Oakland Wednesday night
during the World Series
victory celebration. Both
people arrested were students,
one for assaulting an officer
and_ the other for disorderly
conducL

Several eyewitnesses com- _

plained of excessive use of:
force and brutality on the part:
of the campus police in the-

disorderly .conduct arrest. A.‘

companion of the arrested
student said: “He was out in‘
the middle of Forbes, and a cop
pushed him with a billy club.

He tried to ﬂick the cop’s hat —
off his'head, and I guess the '

cop decided that was that. Two,
policemen took him against the’
wall of David Lawrence Hall,:

and one hit him twice over thet
head with a billy club.

“I went towards him, but
two of my friends pulled me

back,” the witness continued. ‘ _

“They were really rough on
him. They put him into one car
between David Lawrence all

I and Hillman (Library) and then 4
whenanother car came they.

transferred him. He has a bad
knee, and he was handcuffed
so he‘. couldn’t mo/ve fast so
they pulled him out by his hair

as he screamed.‘ ‘Stop! I‘ll
come, l’ll come.’ ”

Another eyewitness saw the
incident from the walkway
above Forbes Avenue.

“I was_ standing_ in the
overpass, and I saw this guy
cross the street,” he said.

I “They tried to push him back

with a nightstick. He tried to
tip this cop's hat off. The cop

dragged him to David Law-..
I rence and pushed his face into

the wall. He was being hit with
billy clubs. He was trying to
defend himself, and they. still
hit him. They put the
handcuffs on him and dragged

I him to a car.” ..

The friend of the arrested

student did! admit he was.
drinking and “was pretty well .

gone.” Another eyewitness

saw .:the scene from 15 feet

away on the street in front of
David Lawrence Hall. Denise
DelMaestro said: “I saw this
cop beating this kid over the
back. .Even after’ he was up

slashed and windshield shattered.
Students threw buckets of water, firecrackers,
ﬂaming toilet paper, and in pne instance, bags of soil

from the dormitory windows onto the masses in the ‘

street below.

Even the campus police got into the act. Several
people reported that they saw several officers use
extreme force to ' arrest a disorderly student.
According. to eye witnesses, the police allegedly
struck the student on the head. unnecessarily with
billy clubs. When they transferred the student from

, one patrol ‘car to another, the officers allegedly

‘pulled -him by the hair in an effort to hurry him
along. ‘ _ *

Although campus ‘police ‘reported few incidents of
injuries, more people could “have been seriously
injured. A student could have fallen in front of a
moving vehicle, pushed by the crowd that stood five
and ten’ deep along Forbes,Avenue. An exploding
firecracker could have blinded or otherwise seriously
injured someone. One of the many objects dropped
from the dormitories could have struck a student,
knocking him unconscious or causing other serious
harm. V ' I

As forthe campuslpolice, a riot ‘could have

resulted from the excessive use of violence allegedly
used on the disorderly student. Who trains these law
enforcement officers? They were surrounded by
what could have been a hostile crowd and they acted

like Philadelphia policemen,,using force rather than-

Teason to control the situation. ‘

In essence, A
championship seemed to overshadow the Pirates’
victory itself. For some, it seemed as though’ the

the celebration after the world -

Page 4-‘3Friday, October 19, 1979

Bucs’ victory was simply an excuse to party.
In other works, the meaning of the victory was lost

in the frenzy that followed the game. Where.were all

the Pirate “supporters” during the regular season,
when the team needed moral support from its fans?
How many games had the majority of those who
took/ part in Wednesday night’s fiasco attended
during the season?

Odds are that most of those people did not attend
one regular season game. After all, the Pirates were
in the pennant race since the All Star Break in July.
When they needed the support then, they rarely got
it. ' ~

Pittsburghers have the right to be jubilant over the
Pirates World Series Victory. It marked the second,
World Championship by a Pittsburgh team in less
than at year. But, there is a difference between a
celebration . and an uncontrolled rabble of
troublemakers. ‘ ‘ ' -

While most students were not - involved in th
incidents that m_arred Wednesday night’s celebration,
it would appear to outsiders that Pittsburghers have
about as much class as a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich. , '

The real test for the Pirates will come next season,

when their ‘title is onthe line and every team will be ~

attempting to. knock them‘ off their pedestal. That
means they will need hometown support‘ to cheer
them on to- victory during the season, not after it
ends. ‘ ' . '

If Pittsburghreally supports their Bucs, they will
turn out in droves during the regulartseason. Then,

and only then, can we truly claim that “we are

family.” — , r _ i

Homecoming Formal Leaves Doubts in Mind of Student

‘ As a member of the student body
of this university, I feel compelled
to voice my opinion of the recent
Homecoming formal. If this was
the best you could conjure up, then
you have just lost at least four
supporters of your government.
The affair was unimpressive,
shabbily run and not enjoyable at
all. The behavior of many of the
students was deplorable. Although
I know the Homecoming Commit-
tee put much time and effort into

this, the results did not reﬂect their —

work. Let me cite some examples:

First, when I came into‘ the
ballroom, there was no one present
to check my name off a list or take

my ticket. If I had not held a ticket, I

I could still have come, danced and
drank without anyone stopping me.
At the price of liquor these days,
does the SGB really have enough
funds to let anyone come and drink
at the expense of other students?

Second, the dance floor was not
nearly large enough. Surely
someone among your “people-in-
charge” has enough intelligence to
realize that it is physically
impossible for more than \300
people to dance on a floor of ‘the
size thatiwas provided. But, it was
obvious that someone did not have
the required amount of intelli-
gence. A‘

Third, the band that the SGB
obtained did not rate being called a
band. Since when does a band play
one song, take a 10-minute break;
play. another song and take another
break? If your people signed this
kind of contract with them, perhaps
they should take a course in
contract law. Also,‘ the music they
played was very poor. I’m sure you
realize that this _is simply another
opinion,but I am willing to bet that
anyone with any appreciation of
music in them will agree with me.

Fourth, the table service was
extremely poor to put it bluntly.
Why did we get cold hors d’oevres
only when the entire affair was half
over? Everything should have
been provided when we arrived.

‘If the SGB would like to know

Pitt Hosts Classic
Volleyball Encounter

By JEFF DUROSKO
Asst. Pitt News Sports Editor
The Pitt women’s volleyball team
will be looking for their third
invitational win of the season. this

1’./"weekend as they host Ottawa, Ohio

State and Rutgers in the first
annual Pitt Classic.

During the week, the Panther-
ettes defeated Penn State and
Edinboro in dual matches. Against
the Lady Lions on Wednesday
night, Pitt fell behind in the match
by losing the first game 15-12. but
rebounded to take the match three
games to one. Pitt downed Penn
State 15-9, 15-11, 16-14.

Pitt defeated Edinboro in three
straight games Thursday by scores

' of 15-8. 15-3. 15-7.

R

“We’ve been playing kind of ﬂat
this week,” said head coach Mike
Hebert. “In the Penn State match,
we played the freshman after the
first game and they handled
Edinboro with the same ease our
starters did.” '

Hebert said the Pantherette
schedule is actually at a low point
as far as competition is concerned.

“I’m worried about it,” he said.

“When you get used to playing at a —

certain tempo with a quick offense.
it I takes more intensity and
concentration. ‘

“But,” he continued, “when you
get back to the East, most teams
can't do that. They slow down, and
if we don’t watch it they could
cause us to slow down and lose our
edgef’

The coach added that this week’s
Pitt Classic will provide some of the
best competition the Pantherettes
will see for the rest of the year.

Pitt’s ﬁrst competition will be

Ottawa University, who will actual- '
_ly be beginning their season at the

tournament.

“They come from a strong area
in volleyball tradition where the
teams are typically strong and very
competitive,” said Hebert. “Any-
time you get a Canadian team down
here, you are guaranteed-a good‘
opponent.”

Hebert also had words of praise"
for the other two teams in the
tournament. Rutgers won the
Temple Invitational two weeks ago
andwould have had the chance to
improve since ‘Pitt last played
them, according to the coach.

“Ohio State lost no one from last
year’s team, which ﬁnished i_n a tie
for 10th in the nation,” he said.
“Atzthe Houston Invitational, they
played Houston closely and should
be great competition.”

Hebert added that Pitt would be
ranked somewhere between 10th
and 15th in the country if rankings,
were given.

“We have to play well this
weekend in order to win,” he said,
“because these other teams are
reaching the meat of their season
and should be peaking just about
now.”

Fighting Scots Fall to

By ANNA ARLOTTA

The Pitt soccer team may very
will be at a turning point in its 1979
season after defeating Edinboro 2-1
to record their first back-to-back
wins this fall. The Scots, although
winless, came into the Pitt game a
very strong and determined team
to meet their rivals. the Panthers.

, Due‘ to these circumstances, plus
the fact that both teams played
with a number of Western
Pennsylvania alumni, made for a
very hard-fought, physical contest
from beginning to end. Of the 22-
starting players who saw most of
the action throughout the_game, 15
of these had played high school ball
together or" against each other in
previous years.

Pitt took an early lead when
midﬁelder Danny Hamm 3scored
his first goal of the season and the
initial goal of his Panther soccer
career. Hamm took a pass from
fellow midﬁelder Al Adelmann and
controlled the 30-yard line to put
the Panthers up 1-0.

shouldn't take this team too lightly
even if they had yet to win a game. '
The way they played against us
made me think that they should
have a much better record that they
came into the game with.”

The Panthers showed their
opponents that they were not
about to be taken too lightly either
when they came back to score just
ﬁve minutes later. After going a

long time without scoring, fresh-
man wing Eric Tiedtke put himself
back into the goal-soaring brackets
with what proved to be the game
winning ﬁnish.

Tiedtke, who started against
Edinboro after four games in the
backup wing position. received a
pass cross from left wing Jeff
Tissue and shot the ball past
Edinboro goalie Rick Minetti to put
the Panthers ahead 2-1.

Netters Pound the Rock

played solidly to emerge a 6-4, 6-4
victor. Aldene Lacaria also lost her
first set, only to rebound for the
win; 3-6. 6-0. 6-3. Freshman Beth
Baughman lost .the only match in
the singles competition 2-6, 4-6.

The Pantherettes moved into the
doubles with a 5-1 lead. enough to
have the match already clinched.
The duo of Belkin-Jacobson easily
won 6-1. 6-1.

But Pitt dropped the final two

Coach Louise Rick was pleased

with the team’s performance after
a lengthy layoff.

"‘lt was nice to return to action
with a win. and it’s always nice to
beat “the Rock.” she said. “It was
also a good conﬁdence-builder for
Lisa La_Furia and Jan Brownstein."

match of the year 5-4.

16 due to rain. only to be called off
again after just two individual

I matches, were played.

Tissue was given an assist on the
play. *

The Panthers returned from

halftime with a 2-1 lead looking to '

put a few more goals on the board. .
One of the biggest chances that
they had came early in the second

half when Tiedtke, for the second’

game in a row, was fouled in the
penalty area. Tissue was again
elected to shoot the penalty kick.

Although his penalty shot in last »

week's 2-0 win over Davis’ and
Elkins was successful, Tissue’s
shot against Edinboro just missed.
It hit the post, leaving the Panthers
with only a one-goal lead.

That one goal difference was
enough to boost the Panthers’
record to 3-5-2 on the season. Pitt
has won three of its past four
games. The victory for the
Panthers should build up the
team’s momentum as it goes into
two tough games next week, both

on the road. Pitt will face Penn. '

State next Tuesday and will then
travel to Lock Haven ‘Saturday.

The Panthers upset the Nittany
Lions 2-0 last season. Penn State
surely has not forgotten that defeat
and will be more than ready to
meet the Panthers at Beaver
Stadium Tuesday .night._

It looks like a dream weekend for
‘college football fans, although it
has become something of a

_ nightmare for the folks at ABC-TV.

They had the nation's No. 1
team-—Southern California—all
lined up to defy the Notre Dame
legend and mystique at South
Bend, Ind. But now, thanks to the
Trojans’ embarrassing 21-21 tie
against Stanford last weekend-
Southern Cal blew a 21-0 halftime
lead-they are only No. 4: .

Another problem is that Ala-
bama and Texas, this week’s No.
1-2 teams, can each be on TV only
once more this season. The
network decided upon unbeaten
Texas and Arkansas this week as
the biggest- of five regionals
following Southern Cal-Notre
Dame, meaning that the Nov. 10
game between Texas and Houston
will not be televised.

The last time Southern Cal
invaded South Bend, which the
Trojans do every other year, Notre
Dame Coach Dan Devine garbed
his players in green jerseys. It
turned out to be . a brilliant
psychological ploy and the Fighting
Irish havebeen wearing green at
home ever since...and making
opponents see red. Until now, that
is...Southern Cal 28-14.

Last week’s score was 42 right,
26 wrong and one tie for a dismal

I     Willthe ‘Real’ Panthers Stand Up Tomorrow?
Sports shorts

Pitt’s game at Washington tomorrow afternoon
should answer many questions concerning the 1979
Panthers. : The biggest question that will be answered
concerns the quality of this team. Is Pitt one of the
10 best teams in the country, capable of going 10-1,

or is it actually a carbon copy of last year’s 8-4 -

squad?

Washington Coach Don James, who led the
Huskies to a Rose Bowl victory two years ago,
seemed a bit down on his squad following last week’s

12-7 loss at Arizona State. He even managed to .

chuckle when someone reminded him that his team
was ranked No. 12 this week. A ‘

‘,‘I don’t know how or why,” James said, raising a
few eyebrows in the process. “There have got to be
12' teams in-the country better than we are. ’ ’

James was particularly upset with the play of his
defense, and is worried because 'he felt his team
hadn’t been tested "prior to the Arizona State game.
And, in the loss to the Sun Devils, the Washington

. offense stopped itself on several occasions.

There was another possible factor involvedin last‘
week’s game, but James refused to accept it as a_
Before the game, Arizona

.   Classifieds

 

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

  

State’s veteran coach Frank Kush was fired, due to
charges filed by one of his players against him. The
player claimed Kush "had punched him on the field
during a game and tried to pressure him into quitting
the squadiand giving up his scholarship.

“I don’t think it had any effect on the game from
our standpoint, ” James said. '

But in any event, the Arizona State players and
fans were at’ an emotional peak, and Kush was
carried triumphantly off the field following the
game. A

J ames’s concernthis week is with Pitt, although he I
_ mayhave a tough time not looking ahead to his next

two games, which are Pacific 10 contests with UCLA
and California. On the subject of Pitt, however,
James is quick to praise the team. , .
“We’re very impressed with Randy M.cMillan; we
haven’t faced any running back like him,” James

 

said. “And we have great respect for (Benjie)’P'lryor,
the tight end. ’ ’ ‘

 

And with Washington’s concern about Pitt very 

real, so is Pitt’s fear of the Huskies.

“Washington is by far the quickest team we’ve . I

played,” said offensive coordinator Wally English,

(Dennis Brown, a second-string cornerback for the ‘

Huskes, runs a 4.2-that’s right-a 4.2 40-yard-dash.) ‘~

It will be interesting to see what the Panthers will
do should they fall behind early in the game. Will
they abandon their running game and throw theball
more than 40 times, as they did last year against Navy
and earlier this year in the loss to North Carolina? "

According to English, the Pitt coaches would like-

to run and pass the ball at a percentage ratio of 65._-
35. So far this season, the Panthers have run the ball:

’about 60 percent of the time, while they’ve thrown
the ball 40 percent of the time.

“But,” said English, “if they’re stacked against

the run, then we’re going to throw the ball, and if ’

they lay back for the pass, we’re going to run. That’s
our basic philosophy—we’l-l take whatever they give
us.” »

By The Associated Press

A To those who still doubt, to those

V who think it’s corny, the Pittsburgh

,‘Pirates still say it’s all in the

“famil '.” I
ThePirates opened their season
by losing 10 of their first 14 games.

-They opened the World Series by

losing three of their first» four.
But, in the lyrics of the Pirates’

favorite disco tune, “No, we don’t

get depressed. Here’s what we call

our golden rule—have faith in you .

and the things you do.”

And in the end, Pirates ‘sprayed
champagn/e together and challeng-
ed‘ anyone to discredit the notion
that :team togetherness was as

_. ' much a key to their success as their
_. record .323 Series batting average.

_“Who* says we don’t have a
family now?" Dave Parker shouted
in the lockerroom in Baltimore

Wednesday night after the Pirates‘

beat the Orioles 4-1 in game seven.
“Who doubts ‘the family’ now,”

echoed catcher Ed Ott.

“ls there anybody in this room
who doesn't believe we have a

V’ family now? ’ ’

The Pirates had been on the
defensive about billing themselves

as -“.the family” after a newspaper _

article in Baltimore suggested the

  “ 1’ 1'  

I

whole thing was “a bad joke” and
a “cheap grandstand play.”

“A'ny team that tries to compare
itself to a family is straining for
attention.’ It's artificial. it’s a
gimmick,” the article said.

The Pirates pointed out that
doubters are-also mentioned in the
song that inspired their nickname.
The disco tune, “We Are Family”
is by the group Sister Sledge, made
up of ‘Kathie, Debbie, Kim, and
Joni Sledge. ’

“Everybody -can see were
together as we walk on by,” the
lyrics go. “All of the people
around us, they say, ‘Can they be
that close?”’ ‘ , ,

Willie Stargell, Pirate captain
and Series MVP, " says the
Pittsburgh team is that close.

‘.‘There is a family closeness on
this team that is unique,” Stargell
said earlier this season. “Writers
and other people who have been

around other Clubhouses say it isri’t‘ A

that way elsewhere. And we don’t
put on airs. tWe are that way.”

Stargell first played “We Are
Family” over and over on the
clubhouse stereoafter the Pirates»
lost three tough games in San
Diego in mid-June.

“Someon?asked me if the family

I

was overrated," Stargell said after
the World Series triumph.

“That bothered me because this
person didn’t live with us and

  
 

 

   

P
together.’ ’

PHILADELPHIA—Dallas Green
was named manager of the
Philadelphia Phillies yesterday
with the intent of finishing the job
he started as interim manager
when Danny Ozark was fired in
August.

“I think I can do a job for the
Philadelphia Phillies, and I think
we have enough talent to do the
job,” said Green, 45, at a press
conference called by the National
League team to announce his

 one-year contract.

“I think Paul Owens, director of
player personnal, and I are
prepared to do what we have to do
make a winner. We don’t want to
break up the nucleus of the team,
but we’ll do what we have to,”
Green added. .

Green, the Phillies’ farm dir-
ector, went into the dugout for the
final month of the season to find
out why a team favored to win its
fourth straight NL East title had

- dropped to ﬁfth place.

Under Green, the Phillies won 19
and lost 11 and overtook the
Chicago Cubs for fourth place in
the division, but-still trailed the
Pittsburgh Pirates by 14 games.

“There are good baseball play-
ers on this team that want to win,”

said Green. “We won three years
in a row, and that was quite a shock
to go through what they went
through—the firing of Danny
Ozark, the roughness and gruff-
ness of me that they haven't been
used to for six or seven years.

, “That is a pretty big blow for our
guys to come through, but they
handled it and they proved they can
win. That’s really what we were

trying to get across to them,” A

Green said.

“We wanted to stay within the
organization,” said Owens. “We
were more than pleased with the
job Dallasdid on the ﬁeld...and
Ruly Carpenter, the Phillies’
owner, and I decided he’s the right
man for the job.”

Owens said he received 15
applications but never interviewed
anyone outside the club. “Some-
one coming in is going to take six
months to learn the individuals,
and I don’t think we have the time.

“We’re not just hoping to
become a contender again,”
Owens said, referring to the World

Series. The Phillies have appeared-

in the series twice, losing to the
Boston Red Sox in 1915 and the
New York Yankees in 1950.

“We have to paste everybody
back together again. Ithink our
doctors are in the process of doing
that.” said Green.

.“We can play with anybody if
we’re well, and we were not well
this year. Especially our ‘pitching
staff—it was riddled and never go
itself together. And we had some
off-seasons by some key guys,”
Green added.

‘‘I’m concernedabout our pitch-
ing—our bullpen more than our
starters,” Green said of possible
trades. “I’d like some more bench‘
strength, a little maneuverability.”

Green said he would institute an
off-season conditioning program
after talking with team trainer D-on
Seger, although many of the
players already work out during the
winter months. Green also said
pitchers would run, which some did
not do under Ozark..

Coaches Bobby Wine, Billy
DeMars and Herm Starrette -will be
retained, while Bob Tiefenauer will
return to the Phillies’ minor league
system as a pitching instructor.

the American Association this
season, and former Phillies catcher
Mike Ryan will join the coaching
staff.

“With a change or two, we can
be as strong as anybody in the
league,” Green said.

“If we do not make a change and
all our people trepair themselves

and prepare themselves for having _

their best years, we can compete,
too,” he -added.

“My decision to go from interim
manager to full-time manager was
thought out quite considerably,”
Green said. “I told you all along in
those 30 days as interim manager I
didn’t want to think about 1980.

“I did start to enjoy it,” Green
said. “Paul mentioned to me not to
sell myself short...'I went back and
talked with my family and I’m just
tickled to death for the opportun-
ity.” -

Green said an important con-
sideration in taking the managerial
job was security.
