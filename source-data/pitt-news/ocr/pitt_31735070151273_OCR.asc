Gideon Bradshaw.

A Chinese organization’s list of theworld’s
. top 500 universities claims that Pitt’s position
among the world’s universities  declined

' slightly over the last few years.

The Center for World-Class Universities

- at Shanghaijiao Tong University in Shanghai,
China, put Pitt in the top iOC$_ universities in
the world when it released its annual Aca-

T demic Ranking of World Universities earlier
this month. Although Pitt has fallen in the
rankings over the last few years, in many
specialized areas, especially medicine, it has

remained strong. Universities in the U.S. and -

other Western countries continue to dominate
the list. ‘ .
Pitt appeared 61st in the institutional rank-

- ings for 2013, down a few spots from 58th in

2012 and 57th in 2011. In 2003, the ﬁrst year
the center published these rankings, Pitt was
ranked 53rd. Pitt’s best showing in the Chi-
nese center’s rankings was in 2005 when it
ranked 43rd.- T

commentbecause he and other administrators

land Farmers Market, which convened every
Friday this summer. Both graduates have
other sources of income and paid for their
project throughamixof their ownfunds and
a grant from a local nonproﬁt organization.

Good and Matthews went to high school
together just outside of Pittsburgh in the
Plum, Pa., area, remaining close through-

out college. Matthews, who holds a degree T

in English writing, and Good, who holds a

 

degree in biology, both graduated in 2011.
While studying abroad in London as an
undergrad, Good ate his way through various
European nations, sampling different cui-
sines. After he arrived home, he experienced

CREPES

AmeriCorps, a corporation geared toward
nationwide community service. Matthews,
who had been working with UPMC for two
years, agreed to take on the challenge with
his old pal, and the two started selling crepes
this May.

The two men handle all the business
operations, includingvcooking, setting up
and serving. Although they do hope to hire
employees in the future, they want to ﬁrst
build enough revenue to expand the business
with initiatives such as a food truck and a
permanent spot on the street.

Specialty crepes at the stand run for about
$7, but customers can also choose to build
their own crepe with avariety of ﬁllings both
savory and sweet. The crepe itselfis priced at
$3, and most ﬁllings cost about $1 each. The
low prices make the Creped Crusaders com-
petitive with the brick—and—mortar Crepes
Parisiennes on South Craig Street.

Pitt sophomore Caitlin Shoemaker en-
joyed the addition to the market, digging
into a crepe ﬁlled with hummus and onions
— one of the stand’s savory options. “The
Lawrencevillain was really good. I like thatl
can get it on a vegan shell,” Shoemaker said.

One of the sweeter and newer options
to hit the stand,’s signature—items menu in-
cludes a s’more option, which is ﬁlled with

marshmallow ﬂuff, chocolate chips, graham
crackers and cinnamon.

A startup grant for the Creped Crusad-

ers came from Awesome Pittsburgh, a local
chapter of the national Awesome Foundation,
which grants money to creative projects that
the organization’s members deem worthy.

Mike Capsambelis, a trustee of the group, .

said in an email that the group provides one-

time, $1000 grants. There are no restrictions _

about reapplying for an additional grant.

Other programs that have received grants
from Awesome Pittsburgh include ZipPitt, an
urban zipline, and Carrie Deer Salvage Art
Workshop, an on-site workshop housed at
an old steel mill.

“We look for projects that excite us_ and
that we think will inspire, surprise or delight
the whole Pittsburgh community,” Capsam—
belis said. ‘ +

Although many of the expenses for start— .
ingthe business came out of Matthews’ and
Good’s own pockets, Good credited the grant
with getting their enterprise started.

,“Without Awesome Pittsburgh, it would.
still just be an idea that I was kicking around,”
Good said.

Expansion is in the works, but it may be
hampered by the owners’ other projects. Mat-
thews said that they would probably not ob-
tain a street truck anytime soon because of
the permits and inspections such a business
would require. "

“We both have interests outside of the
crepe business, especially creative interests
that may keep us from becoming a restau-
rant,” Good said.

Instead, the pair is considering adding
sandwichesand other crepe options to the
menu. New recipes and punny names are

RANKINGS

did not have time to review the methodology
of the rankings before time of publication.

The list also ranks global universities in
specialized ﬁelds.

In the category of natural sciences and
mathematics, Pitt was ranked between 101st
and 150th both last year and this year. Above
the 50th ranking, the center only lists the
range of positions to which universities be-
long. In engineering/technology and computer
sciences, Pitt also placed in the range between
101st and 150th. In the categories of life and
agricultural sciences, Pitt placed 45th this year
and 44th last year.

Meanwhile in the social sciences, Pitt’s po— .

'sition improved from 48th last year to 46th
this year. M

In the ﬁeld ofclinical medicine and phar-
macy, Pitt’s position has remained steady at
10th on the list both this year and last.

The center’s system of evaluation looks
at the amount of prestige an institution’s re-
searchers and alumni generate on the inter-
national stage.

Eor instance, the rankings are partlybased
on the number of alumni and faculty members
of an institution who receive top international
awards. For most ﬁelds, this means the num-
ber of Nobel Prizes they receive. In mathemat-

if Starting this fall, students who so desire can

eat, sleep and potentially live in the Hillman
Library from Monday to Thursday without
exiting the building.

The library has begun transitioning to ex-
tended hours. Beginning Sept. 9, thelibrary
will open at 10 a.m. Sunday and stay open
until 10 p.m. Friday. On Saturday, it will be
open from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Many students have awaited this change
for years, as other college libraries across the

» nation have expanded their hours to stay open

all the time. Apush for longer hours frequently

_’ appearedion the platforms for Student Gov-
‘ ernment Board candidates.

Rose Morrison, a senior, was pleased with
the development. '
“Pm just surprised it’s taken this long to

, become24/7, consideringhowmuch everyone

wanted it,” Morrison said.

Students weren’t the sole advancers be— ~

bind the push for longer hours. Rush Miller,
the director of the University Library Sys-
tem and a librarian at Hillman, said the idea
wasn’t new.

“We have been trying to get this done for
several years, as the extended hours we have
been trying at ﬁnals time had been so popu-

lar,” Miller said"-in an email. “Clearly we felt

A the need for this has been building and are

just glad we can accommodate the student
population’s desire to have the library open
24 hours.”

But extending library hours could be a
costly venture. ‘

Librarians with advanced training are
needed constantly, but most staff do not
have a degree in library sciences. Shelvers,

circulation attendants and some cataloguers ‘

are often student workers or other staff, and
the reference section is generally staffed by

4 a librarian. In order to keep Hillman open
‘longer, Miller had to be able to ensure that

there were the appropriate people on staff
at all hours.

“I know we added a position for evenings ‘

and additional guard hours,” he said. “We
did this through reallocating a vacant'posi—
tion from elsewhere so that no money was
added to our budget for this change in hours,”
said Miller.

ZarreenAmin, aseniorwho has worked at
the library for more than two years, is looking
forward to the new hours.

“It’s' more opportunity to get more hours of
work,”_Amin said, addingthat it will be easier
to schedule around classes and other com-
rnitments. “Plus, it’ll allow students to study
longer so they don’t have to relocate at 2 a.m.”

Frisk me once, shame onyoue

Stephen Suss
Columnist

Forcthe majority of Americans,
the immediate suspension of
their constitutional: r.ights
pr_otecting their privacy and
property while entering an
airport terminal has become
an expected part of life. There,
Americans’ privacies falls to
the wayside, as people experi-
ence extensive searches, and
occasionally seizures, of their
property. Many Americans take
comfort, at least, in knowing
that this ordeal is temporary,
and that once we have reached
our destination, our rightswill
be reinstalled. C A

T Minority residents in New
York City and other large cit-
ies, however, can not neces-

sarily take this same comfort
that their constitutional rights
won’t be violated outside an
airport terminal. As long as
they are within city limits,

their rights are on a permanent-

hold-, as they can be stopped
at any moment, searched, and
questioned with no probable
cause for arrest.

The New York City Police
Department has adopted this
stop—and-frisk policy in or-
der to ‘combat crime. At least,
that is what it claims. But new
evidence has surfaced proving
that this policy has dispro-
portionately targeted racial
minorities and _revealing that
thestop-and-frisk policy may
do more to fuel racism than to
actually lower crime.

These random acts of search

and seizure by theNYPD are
defended by the landmark
case of Terry vs. Ohio in 1968
in which the Supreme Court
found that the rights embod-
ied in the Fourth Amendment
fail to apply to a police offi-
cer stopping an individual for
brief questioning and frisking.
The assumption was that of-
ﬁcers have the mental capac-
ity to exercise solid judgment
in determining the necessity
of subjecting an individual to
harsh treatment. The evidence,
however, suggests otherwise.
As itturns out, the NYPD
has arguably twisted this pol-
icy into _a virtual witch hunt
against racial minorities. It’s
been found that from 2004

to 2011, whites -— despite only mak-
ing up about 33 percent of New York
City’s population — only accounted
for 10 percent of individuals who had
been stopped and frisked. Of minori-
ties stopped, Latinos made up 31 per-
cent, while blacks made up 52 percent.
Astoundingly, blacks make up only 23
percent of the city’s population.

Not only are blacks and Latinos more
frequently stopped by police, they are
more likely than white to be subjected
to force when questioned as suspects by

police. Ironically, when frisking does
occur, statistics reveal that whites are
more likely to be found with contraband
or an illegal weapon in their possession.

Blame for this racial targeting often
lies on the poor training of officers who
are given vague parameters deﬁning
suspicious behavior — such as “furtive
movements,” which justifiably could be
anything. Others argue that stop—and—
frisk instances occur more frequently
in high-crime areas that have larger
minority populations. The areas de-
termined to be “high crime,” however,

are largely up to officers’ discretions .

and could, therefore, be subject to bias.

Viewing the statistics, it becomes
clear that not only has’ the NYPD taken
Terry vs. Ohio too far — thus making
a mockery of the Fourth’ Amendment
— but it has also managed to attack
the 14th Amendment by intentionally
targeting minorities. With evidence
surfacing that there is little benefit to
the stop- and— frisk policy — through
which only about 10 percent of cases
actually result in an arrest —— it’s clear
that the-stop—and—frisk policy is not
just severely ineffective, but actively
harmful. ‘

This month marks the 50th anni-
versary of Martin Luther King _Ir.’s de-

livery of his “I Have a Dream” speech.
Yet, half a century after this historic
event, we ﬁnd New York City enforcing
a policy that promotes police activity
eerily similar to the racial targeting that
occurred during the Civil Rights move—
ment. The police activity ‘during that
time was similarly ineffective because
it wasn’t actually combating crime, but
attacking human rights. The stop—and—
frisk policy needs to be abolished not
only because it does not make cities any
safer, but also because it violates rights
for which generations of Americans
have fought. I

‘Corpse ﬂower’
  draws cult
crowd to Phipps
Conservatory

John Lavanga
A€9°E Editor

Last Wednesday night, a massive horde
of spectators ﬁlled Phipps Conservatory.
The staff of the conservatory did their
best to control this mob as it shambled
slowly, yet relentlessly, in pursuit of
the inviting scent of rotting ﬂesh. The
night of the blooming corpse ﬂower was
in full swing. ‘

Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunate-
ly for this crowd, the corpse ﬂower’s
trademark stench had all but dissipated
since the ﬂower first bloomed during
the late afternoon on Tuesday.~Romero,
Phipps Conservatory’s blooming Amor-
phophallus Titanum —— more commonly

' known as a corpse flower because of

its distinctive scent — was still quite a
spectacle to behold. The massive ﬂower
was easily taller than many in the room.

Romero’s rarity alone’ made ita sight
worth seeing for many. A native of Su-
matra, Indonesia, the corpse ﬂower is
one of the rarest and largest flowers on
the planet, not to mention one of the
strangest. Rather than utilizing a sac-
charine scent to draw in pollinators like
many otherﬂowers do, the corpse ﬂower
takes a more morbid route, relying on
beetles and ﬂies for pollination that are
attracted to the scent of rotting ﬂesh
the plant releases. In short,.it’s a plant
that fits comfortably into the annalsof
“Ripley’s Believe It or Not”.

According to exhibit coordinatorJor—
dyn Melino, Romero was acquired by
Phipps ‘Conservatory in 2010. Because
of the genetic diversity, of various corpse
ﬂowers —— the species can bloom any-

Drake finds his ‘niche as a ‘softie’ in
      the hip-hopcommunity

Jeff Ihaza
Staff Wrz'ter

Drake’s sensitive bravado and knee—wob¥
bling falsetto (yes, I’m calling Drake’s voice
knee—wobbling), make him great fodder for
Photoshop vandals who have done every-
thing from doctoring pictures of the rapper
during his Degrassi days to adding some
of the most hilarious captions to candid
photos. a

“Does this mean we’re together now?”

’ one caption reads beneath a picture of the

Toronto-born rapper hugging a woman at
the VMAs on Sunday.

The criticism is hackneyed but hysterical:
Drake is a softie, so we make fun of him. It’s

a genuinely fun exercise in escapism. He’s ,

become a pop-culture punchingbag in a
way that I guess only a true softie can: He

takes it because he loves you —— and because _

he’s worth more than most rappers ($30
million). .

“Drake’s the type of dude that waves at
you with two hands,” one Tumblr post reads

with slightly more offensive language.

But the GQ cover boy isn’t phased. His
latest single, “Hold on We’re Going Home,”
is the most bleeding~heart anthem out right
now, and despite thenjokes, it’s really good.
The track rides an ’80s-inspired 808 beat
that rivals Daft Punk’s dance-infused drum
patterns. The chorus is beautiful, albeit
cheesy.

“You’re a good girl and you know it,”
Drake croons. Aww. _ I

The same goes forthe track “Girls Love
Eeyoncé.” Here, we ﬁnd Drake actually sing-
ingvocals from a song made famous by wom-
en. It’s like he’s getting bullied at Degrassi
Community School for wearing women’s

clothing, but he fearlessly continues.

That’s why he’s winning the rap game: He
belongs to a class of artists who truly don’t
care about their public perception. Instead,
he’s making tracks that are self— effacing in a
way. that seems unnatural — he is perhaps
too real.

But he’s also a phenomenal rapper. If
hearing “Started From the Bottom” doesn’t
get you out of your seat, it’s only because
you broke Drake’s heart and he’s over you
now (Rihanna). “5AM in Toronto” puts your
favorite rapper to shame as Drizzy channels

his inner Max B, rapping laps around the

competition.

the choice in theme was glaringly obvi-
ous. With the city’s long-standing tradi-
tion ofproducing zombie ﬁlms such as
“Night of the Living Dead,” directed by
George Romero, no name but Romero
would fit.

“Pittsburgh’s the zombie capital,”
Melino remarked.

Once the big day had finally arrived,
the crowds poured in to get a whiff,
and the conservatory was packed w-ith
everyone from families on a Tuesday-
night gathering to zombie lovers on
an impromptu date night. According
to conservatory docent Jeffrey Lunz,
the interpretations of the scent were as
diverse as the clientele. Whenhe asked
visitors for the smell they most associ-
ated with Romero, the answers ranged.

“I got dead fish. I got Roquefort

cheese, Limburger cheese,” Lunz said,

adding that several med students com-
pared it to “[clostridium difﬁcile] diar-
rhea,” and perhaps most troublingly,
that “one lady said she works in a prison
and it smells just like that.” - ’

Wednesday night’s celebration of the
events took thezombie theme and car-
ried it a step further, with two screen-
ings of Romero’s seminal zombie flick,
“Night of the Living Dead,” zombie-
themed cocktails and a question—and-
answer period with one of the mem-
bers of the film’s original crew, Gary
Streiner.

Streiner was quick, to note that,
though the film never actually used
the word zombie, theconservatory’s
decision to build the exhibit around
the zombie theme was “very marketing
smart” and spoke to the legacy Romero
had built for himself in the city.

Sadly, the celebrations couldn’t last V

long. After about 48 hours, the corpse
flower began to collapse in on itself and
wither away, leaving only memories
of a stench and a rare moment when
it seemed perfectly natural to discuss

zombies and rare ﬂowers in the same '

breath. _

For those who unfortunately missed
the event, though, there may a sequel.
Behind Romero, there stand a series of
green stalks nearly as tall as the ﬂower
itself. These are the stalks of Phipps
Conservatory’s other corpse ﬂower,
which represent the promise that one
night, a corpse ﬂower would rise again.

Pitt releases

ﬁrst depth
chart, begins
prep for F SU

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football released its ﬁrst ofﬁcial two-
deep depth chart of the 2013 season Mon-
day in preparation for its ACC opener
against Florida State on Sept. 2.

The depth chart reﬂects many of the
developments that came through Pitt’s
three-week-long training camp earlier this
month, with redshirt senior Tom Savage
listed as the starting quarterback, true
freshman Tyler Boyd starting at wide re-
ceiver with Devin Street and true freshman
Chris Blewitt starting at kicker.

On defense, the interior defensive line '
remains as expected with Tyrone Ezell and
Aaron Donald slated to start at the tackle
slots. At defensive end, Ejuan Price is listed
as a co—starter after his impressive train-

' ing camp :with David Durham and Bryan

Murphy also starting on each side.
Behind the line, Bam Bradley is. at the
top of the strong-side. linebacker position
while redshirt junior Anthony Gonzalez
is on the weak side to ﬂank redshirt se-
nior Shane Gordon in the middle. Red-
shirt junior Todd Thomas is listed as the
second-team weak-side linebacker after
he left the team before the second day of
training camp but returned the next week.
In front of Savage, Pitt’s offensive line
will consist of Adam Bisnowaty and T.J.
Clemmings as tackles, Cory King and Matt

_ Rotheram as guards and Artie Rowell at

center. Rowell, a redshirt sophomore, won
the battle in training camp against redshirt
freshman Gabe Roberts. ‘

“I thought it was a great competition,
and I think Artie’s earned the opportunity

Predicting the fortunes of fall ACC sports

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

As everyone should know by now, Pitt is
playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference
this year. So, how will Pitt’s fall sports fare
in the new conference?

Across the board, the strength of Pitt’s
schedules in each sport should prove more
difficult than the past few seasons as a part
of the Big East. The football landscape fea-

. tures more depth than arguably any sea-

son Pitt played in the Big East, and both

the men’s and women’s soccer schedules ’

feature competition against teams that
make up the_nation’s best overall soccer
conference. J ' -
Cross Country .
Pitt’s cross country season begins at
the Duquesne Duals on.Sunday,'where Pitt

competes against schools from the western
Pennsylvania area. The ﬁrst competition
for Pitt outside of Pennsylvania comes at
the Notre Dame Invitational in South Bend,
Ind., on Sept. 28. _

In 2013, head coach Alonzo Webb brings

back a great deal of experience on both the —

men’s and women’s sides. A
‘Sophomore Rachel Brown looks to build
an a strong 2012, when she placed in the

,_ Top 10 at the 2012 Duquesne Duals along:

side junior Morgan Perry, who won the Cap-
py Anderson Invitational last season. Last
season, the women’s side compiled a pair
of ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes, two second-place
ﬁnishes and placed sixth in the Eastern
College Athletic Conference Championship.

The men’s contingent lost four runners
at last spring’s graduation and will this
year be led by Ben Kisley and Rich Addi-

son. Kisley notched a second-place ﬁnish
at the Cappy Anderson Invitational last

. season, while_ Addison placed third in the

same event.

At the Cappy Anderson Invitational,
both the men and the women took ﬁrst
place overall: ‘

Prediction: As Pitt enters the ACC, the
competition gets tougher. The Panthers
will run against the likes of Virginia Tech,
Florida State, Duke and Boston College, all
of whom placed at or near the top in both
the men’s and women’s events. With experi-
ence returning in force for Pitt, the runners

should be able to compete immediately, but.

expect Pitt to ﬁnish near the middle of the
pack against tougher competition.

to start in the end,” Chryst said. “I think
Gabe did a lot of good things and is con-
tinuing to improve, but right now we felt
Artie probably. gave us the best chance
right now.”

The two sides on the line of scrimmage
are what Chryst identiﬁed early as a key
against Florida State.

“One of the strengths of Florida State

August 27, 2013 | The Pitt News I wvwx/.pittnevvs.c0m

certainly is their offensive line,” Chryst
said. “Most football games you play in,
who controls the line of scrimmage is a
team that has an advantage.”

On special teams, Blewitt won the start-

ing kicker job over Brad Lukasak, while.

Matt Yoklic retains his spot as the team’s
starting punter. Lafayette Pitts and Jason
Hendricks will return kicks, while K’Waun
Williams is listed as the starting punt re-
turner.

An interesting wrinkle comes at the tail-
back position, where junior Isaac Bennett

is still the starting running back. Redshirt
sophomore Malcolm Crockett is listed as
his backup, and freshmanjames Conner is
not included on the two-deep, although he
took the lion’s share of carries in practice

during the weeks Bennett missed.

Conner sustained a shoulder injury in
Pitt’s scrimmage that concluded training
‘camp last week, but tweeted “Shoulder is
good!” later that afternoon. "Chryst said

both Bennett and Conner did some work_

in practice Monday, but the extent of the
work is unknown.

“[Bennett] obviously missed quite a
bit of time, so it’s still a little bit too early
to tell,” Chryst said. “He was able to go
through some things today, more than he’s
done before.”

In the coming week, as with the previ-
ous eight months since Pitt last played,
Chryst emphasized approaching the team’s
ACC debut in no different of a manner.

“We have a tremendous amount of re-
spect for that team,” Chryst said. “But I
think you can create a consistent approach
to the way you prepare.” a

record in 2012, but went 7-8 against a Big
East schedule that sent two teams — Notre
Dame and Marquette — to the NCAA Tour-
nament -—— though both were bounced in
the ﬁrst round. '

This season, Pitt’s schedule features four
NCAA Tournament teams, highlighted by a
Florida State team that ﬁnished No. 9 in the
season’s ﬁnal poll.

While the going does get tougher, Pitt re-
turns 12 players from last year’s team. More
importantly, ﬁve of the team’s six starters
from last year are back in the fold, as is new
head coach Dan Fisher, who compiled a75—2
record at Concordia University.

On the frontlines, Pitt returns leaders
in nearly every major statistical category.
Junior setter Lindsey Zitzke led the team
with 9.09 assists last season, junior libero
Delaney Clesen notched 292 digs, senior
outside hitter Monica Wignot racked up 267
kills, and junior outside hitterjessica Wynn
blocked 80 shots last season.

Prediction: (18-15, 9-11 ACC) Pitt’s ex-
perience and returning talent should keep
_the Panthers around .500 for most of the
season, but the wear-and-tear of a tougher
slate of games may take its toll late in the
season. 3
