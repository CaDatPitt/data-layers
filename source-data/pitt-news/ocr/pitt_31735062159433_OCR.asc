Committee

Pact Offer
At Hand

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Pitt News Sports Editor
An offer of new contract terms

to Head Football Coach Walter
"Mike" Milligan appears to be
only a matter of days - it may
come tomorrow. I A
Pitt’s eight-man Athletic
Committee met with Athletic Di-

rector Tom Hamilton at the’

Roosevelt Hotel last evening to

discuss, among other things, con-
tract terms. Their decision may
spend a brief time in the laps of
other University officials, but
should waste little time getting to
Milligan.

Hamilton, queried after the meet-
ing as to whether contract terms
would be discussed with the coach
very shortly after his return from
Pasadena’s Rose Bowl contest,
replied, “I suppose so.” Milligan
arrived home about one hour after
that statement.

Action Delayed

Milligan’s present contract, a
three-year agreement which expires
next month, was expected to be ac-
ted upon with less delay.

Committee Chairman Dr. Norman
C. Ochsenhirt said in early Decem-
ber that his group would convene
“before Christmas.” Noparley was
held, however, until last night.

There has been little, if any,
doubt right along that the head
coach would be offered a contract
renewal. After winning only one of
of nine games his first year, his
teams came back“ to compile a pair
of six-three seasons.

Speculation Over Length

Considerable speculation has
arisen over the possibility of the
new pact being a short-term agree-
ment.

Milligan’s present salary has
been variously estimated at $8,000

(to $10,000.

Crawling out of bed last night,
the Panther mentor told the News
in a telephone conversation that
the Rose Bowl game, in which Ohio
State slipped by California, 17-14,
was a well-played affair.

The Buckeye victory is looked
upon by Pitt partisans as a boost
for the local heroes, who in Nov-
ember outplayed Wes Fesler’s club
statistically but were, left holding
the light end of a 14-10 score.

Bus Death  
Inquest «Soon

The inquest into the death of
Leon Ladd, the boy who was killed
by the University bus Dec. 12, will
be held within the next two weeks,
according to the coroner's office.

The accident occurred while
Raymond Allen, the bus-driver_,
was turning around at Gate Three
of the Stadium. Allen was held by
police on a technical charge of
manslaughter, and is now free until
the inquest on $1,000 bail. P

A truck-driver, presumably an
eye-witness to the accident, who
carried the boy into the Presby-
terian Hospital, has not been lo-
cated. Both Allen and Yussif Ibra-
him, the only passenger on the bus
at the time, told police they were
not aware of the boy's presence be-
fore the accident.

Allen was back on duty two days
after the accident.

But for a twist of fate, the clos-
ing of Trees Gym, the accident
might not have occurred. The bus
ordinarily turns at Trees, but when

.the gym was closed as a safety

measure after cracks appeared in
the plaster, the bus route was
shortened. Instead of being parked
between trips at the gym, it was
parked at the Stadium.

Seiling Faces

Grand Jury

Eugene Seiling, accused ofthrow-
ing the jug that Koed Pitt coed
Marjorie Homan as she watched
the Pitt-Penn State football game,
faces grand jury action.

At a hearing before Magistrate
William Redmond in Oakland Police
Station it was decided to push the
case on to the grand jury which

will decide whether the city will,

prosecute on aggravated assault
and battery charges. Seiling re-
signed from Pitt shortly after the.
incident.

Seiling allegedly tossed the
half-gallon wine jug during the
height of the action. Friends with
whom Miss Homan attended the
game carried her to nearby Presby-
terian Hospital where she remained
over the weekend as a result of in-
juries inflicted when the jug shat-
tered on her head.

During the entire case Seiling
has, steadfastly denied that he
threw the jug. Mrs. Paul J. Homan,
mother of the Tri-Delt sophomore,
commented to the Pitt News that it
was “too bad” about the whole
affair.

Phi Kaps Cleared on °Necking’

By non Trroi/iAs

Common Pleas Court Judge A,
Marshall Thompson absolved Phi
Kappa fraternity of all "necking”
Charges placed against it by Hamp-
ton Hall residents W. H. Wilson
and Henry K. Kirk-Patrick, in a
suit filed on Sept. 28. '

In a 19-page statement delivered
00 Ian» 3, Judge Thompson also
told the fraternity thatit could con-

1 tinue to use its backyard parking

lot providing itwas given a "smooth,
firm” resurfacing job. This ‘ ‘smooth,
firm” covering, however, may not
completely smooth over the frat’s
stormy relations withits neighbors.

More Action Possible
Indications are that me or pos-
sibly both of the opposing lawyers
plan further action on the decree of
Judge Thompson which becomes
final if not appealed within ten
days. *=When asked whether she
planned an appeal of the decision,
Ella Graubart, attorney for Wilson
and Kirk-Patrick, commented, "I

have not made up my mind.”

Passive friction between the Phi
iaps and theirneighbors boiled into
the open on Sept. 28 when Wilson
and Kirk-Patrick filed a suit in a
court of equity to stop petting, of-
fensive language,‘and excessive
noise in the Phi Kaps backyard
parking lot. The suit also sought
to enjoin the frat men from parking
in the lot.

Lot Held Nuisance

Witnesses testified that the park-
ing lot was illegal and a ‘ ‘nuisance.”
Wilson at that time told the court,
"1 have hadno sleep fortwo years.”
He claimed that "the noise of start-
ing cars _prevents conversation.”

Both lawye::~s bypassed the neck-
ing and petting charges during the
three hearings which made urrthe
court battle. Phi Kappa alumni and
parents threatened, however, to file
libel suits for over $500,000 against
the complaintents in the case. The
suits have not as yet been filed.

In his decision Judge Thompson
said that perhaps the neighbors
were inconvenienced by the back-
yard parking lot but that the resur-
facing surface should end the trouble.

Spotty Play  

By WILL DOERGE
Westminster’s Titans proved"
a little too tall and a little too
tough for Pitt’s undersized bas-
ketball five last night at the
Stadium, easily defeating the

Panthers, 49-38.

Using their height to advan-
tage in controlling the back-
boards, and capitalizing on numer-
ous Pitt mistakes, the Titans took
an early lead and coasted to
victory.

A pair of 6/3 men, Sophomore.
Pat King and Captain Allen McCul-
lough, were the big men under the
hoop. King-led the scorers with 14
points while McCullough tallied 10.

Pitt Defense Shabby

Pitt's unorganized defense gave
Westminster plenty of openings for
easy shots. This, plus poor passing

Time and again Westminster in-
tercepted careless Pitt passes and
drove in for easy lay-up shots,
Jackie Jones being the chief ball-
stealing culprit.

Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi, playing’
his first game for the Panthers,Was
one of the few bright spots on the
Pitt side. His 12 points topped the
local scorers.

' Panthers Best from Field

Pitt outscored Westminster from
the field, netting 16 field goals to
the Titans’ 15. At the foul line,
however, the Titans were way
ahead, dropping in 19 of 28 free
throws while Pitt made 6 out of 11.

The smaller Panthers consis-
tently fouled their taller foes while
trying to gain possession of the

ball off the boards. Pitt tried to
make up for its lack of height by

constantly hounding the ball, but
it backfired on them by giving the
Titans an excess of foul shots.
Second Half Romp

Westminster held a 30-20 half-
time ilead. They increased their
lead to 42-27 after 12 minutes of
second halfplay, and the closest
Pitt came after that was 47-38
near the end. A

In the preliminary thriller, the
Westminster Jayvees edged the Pitt
Frosh, 48-46. Mike Zernich’s 15
points led the Panthers.

Trees Gym Ruled Safe,
Classes Resumed Today

By DAVE WINTER

Trees Gym has been declared safe. The athletic department
announced late yesterday that classes would be resumed this
morning, ending a dismissal which lasted nine school days.

The gym was closed on Dec. 8
to avoid possible injury to students
from falling plaster. Liquid cement,
pumped under pressure into an
abandoned nineteenth-century coal
mine to provide a solid base for the
new Veteran’s Hospital, unsettled
the gym foundation.

Cracks in the walls of the build-
ing appeared, and the boiler room
floor got an unexpected-re-paving
when the cement cracked it open.

Frank Carver, graduate manager
of athletics said that the question
of future use of the swimming pool
will be decided after Jan. 10, when

the pumping will be finished.

Dr. John Weber, secretary of the J

University, ordered the gym closed
to prevent accidents pending an
investigation during the Christmas
holidays.

Intramural basketball games at
the gym were canceled and the
swimming team switched its prac-
tice sessions to the YMHA pool.

Plans had been made to change
the IM basketball competition into
a sudden death tournament, and
games were to be played at Logan
Armory if Trees was permanently
closed. .

-2'-H our Service

V. The story of last night’s W’estminster basketball game, repre-
sents the closest the News has come to matching the speed of

the Pittsburgh dailies in the school paper’s long history.
‘ When they sawlthis article, only a little more than a half day

“old, on our front page, perhaps ‘the readers of the News wondered
how and why now and never before. We hope ‘it was a pleasant
surprise to, see this publication today put the word "news” in
newspaper with the timeliness of the basketball story.
, This has long been a source of concern_,,among those of us
“ who look on a newspaper as a means of keeping its readers up-to-
ate, not by pulling together. happenings through‘ mo st of a week,
ut by enphasizing immediacy. We've longed to deal with “live”
ws,; not with putting some life into, events that are going stale.
For various reasons, we have rarely been afforded this oppor-
i~t7y. Many of them are physical--the limits of the time we can
rte to the paper (already well stretched), early deadlines
her closely dictated in our printing contract, infrequency o
mportant, last-minute news, and a host of others.‘ V
 But the Westminster game, representing possibly the most
important home game as the Panthers’ opener and, at the same
. tr :e, -the only Stadium game this winter scheduled the day before
an issue of the News, caused us to smack our lips. Here was our
T 5 chance to hit thestands not more than a few hours in arrears of
the dailies.

x,Of course, to do this meant extra-duty on the part of’ several
members of the staff and the cooperation of our printer. We laid
but plans carefully, worked past midnight getting the story ready,
Then the printer tookover. By speeding up his schedule, the read-
rs arereading a timely story of last night's ball game.

Much of the credit for this accomplishment must go to our new
aritype process. With our old letterpress system, under which
i ll the mechanical work was done outside the school,iwe could
‘never have carried this story. It would have had to wait and sour
ntil Tuesday. ' ’ -

, However, this time, with the advantage of doing most of the
fork ourselves, we were able to do 'enough of the work here to
[have the printer polish off the remaining steps swiftly this morn-
glng and still deliver our papers to the stands on time this noon.
 We makeino promises that many or any other stories will get
this treatment during the remaining months of the year, for the
ikelihood of more than one or twomore stories thathave as much
general readership appeal and that would meet the other criteria
hatthe Westminster game story did is slim. We do feel, nonethe-
ess, that with this issue we have demonstrated our concern in
resenting to our readers current news while they still want to
read it and the accomplishments‘we can make with this paper
"under the present method of operation.

At the last minute, we ‘discovered we’d be able toiscore
ouble on "h‘ot” news stories, when we learned the athletic
ornmittee was to meet on Mike Milligan’s contract yesterday
vening. ' - i
‘A So you can see what this issue represents -- a milestone in
he history of the News.

This is round two in ‘the contest to get an adequate student
recreation_ center on the Pitt campus in the near future. ;Since the
first writing on this subject, we have found that we have several
influential members of theMUniversity administration in our corner,
among them Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald, Director of Athletics

Theodore W. Biddle.

This seems like an imposing
array, one which should have no’
trouble, to the student's way of
thinking, in getting such a pro-
posal approved and under way.

Unfortunately, that's not the
way it works out. The Chancellor,-
long an advocate of adequate extra-
curricular facilities, does not have

as the president of a large cor-
poration cannot always dictate his
own policies. As in any such large
organization, Pitt is governed at
the top by a Board of Trustees who
decide the larger aspects .of Uni-
versity policy. 4

These men in turn must consider
the sources of their income, par-
those who are regular

tance to the University.The'wishes
and desires of these people cannot
lightly be disregarded, and when
their ‘desires are at variance with
those of the students or even of
the entire University, the trustees
and administration must do some
pretty fancy stepping ‘to keep off
the wrong toes. -

The problem, then, of securing
for the University a student center
sufficient for such a large and‘po-
tentially growing student body must
be solved by convincingthese
donors that a student center is
just as important to Pitt as a
science building, a libratY» and 3
gymnasium.

The Chancellor and a number of
trustees are already convinced,
particularly after a flying trip some
of them took last fall to several
mid-western campuses who have
student centers. Certainly the stu-
dents as a whole are overwhelm-
ingly in favor of a student center
now. Both groups feel that the
extra-curricular activities housed
there are just as important to a
student's well-rounded education
as the classes planned for the
science hall.

Money Talked

Granted, those who are putting
up the funds are affected rather
directly, too, since it is their
money. But they have already had
their say, while the students have
been left, completely in the dark
on a subject which concerns them
more intimately than anyone else.

O.K. We’ve granted that ‘there is
some basis for the University's
hesitency in acting on the student
center. We” admit that there are
problems to be s‘<'5"lved and people
to be persuaded before they roll a
steamshovel out on the campus.
But why can’t we, the students, at
least be informed as to the progress
and current plans concerning the
project? Why can’t we have a look

at the plans and offer our sugges-

Their intentions may have been

But, finding this method too
slow in acquiring the public plau-
dits, they have’ turned to investi-
gating and censoring other organ-
izations on the campus, striving
to give the impression of diligent
legislating to their constituents.

Turned on News

After failing to rebuke the board
of deans for allowing only one hour
for victory celebrations, these
Congressmen have turned their
attentions to the News. For sev-
eral weeks they threatened to have
the paper investigated ‘and muttered
incoherently of "poor reporting”
and the “lack of publicity.”

The attack flared openly at the
Dec. 12, meeting. Howard Green-
berger, Men's Council represent-
ative to Congress, had a resolu-
tion passed demanding a “public
apology and retraction” for a state-
ment appearing in the News on
Dec. 2. .

According to Greenberger, he
was misquoted and the result of
the error caused "serious reper-
cussions to the (faculty rating)
program.” He objected to the_word
“forced” in the quotation, “The
test wouldn’t be any good unless
the majority of departments were
forced to use it.” Greenberger in-
sisted he had said "coo'perate.”

A check of the notes from the

‘ Nov. 28 meeting showed no mis-

quote. The notes read, "Unless
forced to be used by majority of
departments...”

Elusive “Spirit”

Greenberger will probably claim
that he was "misquoted in the first
quotation of this column since the
final draft of the ‘motion as it was
passed did not have “public apol-
ogy” in it. But if Greenberger will
think back, he will remember that
his original motion demanded a
“public apology and retraction.”

As it usually happens when’
Greenberger proposes a motion,
he has to repeat it several times
to get the “spirit” across. A case.

We want a student center, of
course. But we want also to have
some part in its planning, or at
least a glimpse of what we’re
getting and ‘when, if ever, we’re
going to get it. What we’re afraid
of, next to not getting a center at
all,—is that we’ll get some match-
box hurriedly thrown up but doomed

filing cabinets'(which are huge
compared to some of the other
organization's quarters) is willing
to forego immediate relief rather
than doom the next ten generations
of students to equally cramped
facilities in another building.

Student./ldvice /

While students may not be able
to appreciate some of the problems
involved in planning the building,
certainly their suggestions as to
the actual facilities included in
any student center would. be valu-
able to a planning committee. Why,
then, can’t a number of student
leaders be included on such a com-
mittee, and the plans and proceed-
ings of that committee be opened
to the general student body?

Perhaps a letter to the Chancel-
lot and the Board from Student Con-
gress might bring about the first
measure. The News is willing to
devote" this entire page, if neces-
sary, to a spread on the student
center, including reproductions of
current architects’ plans and any
statement by the building commit-
tee. That should take care of the
latter idea.

iMeanwhile, any and all develop-
ments that can be gleaned by this
reporter will continue to appear in
this space until the center is built.

Student Gongress Reporter

 

Several members of‘Student Congress, in’ the past two months,
-have made a habit of launching into long and tiresome tirades on
topics irrevelant to the subject up for discussion on the floor.

to gather personal publicity and

to keep their names-constantly before the students.

“the student body be polled....
concerning their opinion about a
two-hour victory celebration.”
,During
motion,‘ Greenberger forgot what
he had proposed. He asked the
secretary to read the motion back
to him. Dissatisfied with it and
after four revisions, he got the
spirit. »

If a man forgets what he ha
said from one half hour to another,
I doubt if he can remember what
he said two weeks back.

As the result of the repeated
rewording of motions, especially
by Greenberger and Congressman
‘Don Ewart, the president of Con-
gress issued a ruling requesting all
motions to be written and turned
over to the secretary.

Lots of Idle Talk

There has been a great deal of
idle talk at the Student Congress

that one of the Congressional of-
ficials complained at the ‘long
hours with little work to show for
the time spent in meetings.
Greenberger and Ewart do a lot
of talking at the meetings. They
may hope that some of their words
will appear in print. Perhaps the
sight of their quotations in eight
point type swells their egos and
prevents_ them from admitting to the
inane statements made in their
oratorical wanderings. * A

cussed by Men’s Council.

A Council in the spring to serve for

position opened, another election
is required.

. Howard Greenberger, president
of MC, remarked that under the pre-
sent system of replacing vacated
seats by aninternal election almost
ﬁhalf of Council's membership could
be filled each February by internal
elections. _

Nick Laux, representative t/o

 favored the amendment. “You don’t

New Device to Recor

Earthquakes Acquired

"'35? RAY CHRISTINA

A new seismograph which records earthquakes in ink has been
added to the University of Pittsburgh’s seismological station,
Acting Seismologist Eugene L. Sulkowski revealed.

Mr. Sulkowski, who recently developed the instrument, said.it
is "probably the only one of its kind in existence. "’

The new visual recording seis-
mograph traces an ink pattern on a
revolving paper roll. This paper
may be read easily and ground
tremors can be noticed at the moment
of their occurence.

An aluminum stylus moving across
smoked paper was previously used
in a recorder of this type. Other
recorders now in use here chart
earthquakes by means of a light
beam on photographic paper which
is later developed and printed.

Pitt’s seismological station is
the gift of George Hubbard Clapp,
former trustee of the University
and long a hobbyist in seismology.
It was opened in 1931 when the
Cathedral of Learning was but a
steel framework. _

The station's three electromag-
netic pendula, one vertical and‘
two horizontal, receive the earth
tremors and transmit them elec-
trically to the recorders. They rest
on a concrete pier which isiim-
bedded six feet in the rock beneath
the Cathedral and is surrounded by
a ring of air to decrease vibrations.

Principles derived from earth-
quake study have been success-
fully applied to, construction and
mining techniques

Doc Does Reseach on

Dr. Harold C. Carlson, who has
made a laboratory science out of
basketball, is busy with formulae
again. This time it's the officials
who are under the microscope.

With the aidof Webster's diction-
ary, the Pitt hoop coach has laid
down and defined a set of funda-
mentals which officials should take
stock of. As a side dish, he recom-
mends that all officials be com-
pelled to take IQ tests.

“Perception is the first funda-
mental of officiating,” Good Harold
declared this week. "That includes
seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling,
and tasting. At present, the offi-
cials see and hear, the players
feel, the spectators smell, and'oc-
casionally everybody »goes away
with a bad taste in their mouth.”

Havoc Created

Apperception, said the Doctor,
is the element which plays havoc
with Perception. Why do two per-
sons see one thing in different
lights? Perhaps because of varying
aupbringings, perhaps for personal
profit. Carlson contends there are

many reasons for Apperception.
Apperception likewise influences

Iudgmema aﬂothet fundamental talent:

of officiating, says he. “Judgment
-the ability of the official to make
decisions on what he is perceiving
--can'be influenced by boos, by
player’s actions, orby friendships.”

Carlson points out that the of-
ficial may not be succumbing to
Apperception consciously. He may
be totally unaware that he is its
victim.

IQ Exams Needed
In addition, the Figure Eight in-

 

DR. HAROLD CARISON
Science and Sports

ventor marks down Attention, "the
power or faculty of mental concen-
tration,” as a further point worth
considering. It is in this respect
that intelligence quotient examin-
ations are suggested.

Bias and Observation round out
the list, although Carlson does not
,-think that Bias enters into the pic-
ture to any great extent.

As an extra—curricular activity
to his compiling fundamentals, Dr.
-Carlson is attending local games
nightly to make a statistical check

  

Officiating

on district officials.

Scribbles Notes -

He takes notes on total fouls
called, total fouls not called (in
his opinion,) time of game when
called, time of game when not called
(in his opinion,l_field goals allowed,
field goals disallowed, and count-
less other phases which may occur
to him.

Eventually, he hopes to assemble
the hodge-podge into something of
a constructive nature.

It was Carlson who in 1948 was
awarded a cup for “the outstanding
contribution to basketball.” Will
history repeat itself?

The great play of Panther cap-
tain, George McCrossin, has been
a big factor in Pitt’s better-than-
expected performance so far this
season, He has impressed Coach
Doc Carlson with his inspired lead-
ership and brilliant floor play.

Paces Scores

"McCrossin has been outstand-
ing,” said Carlson. “He’s a great
team player.”

In three road games, McCrossin
has paced the Panther scorers. His
high was 17 points against Utah
State in the Corn Bowl.

As for Cincinnati, Carlson said,
"They were the best team I saw
last year and have lost only one
regular from that team.”

Richter Sharp

A pair of high scoring forwards,
Dick Dallmer (6-3) and Ralph Rich-
ter (6-4) pace the Cincinnati five.
Richter was among the nations

Sports Editor

jinxed me.

Leo Bemis can’t  blamed for wondering if he isleading a

As director of intramural athletics, Bemis has shown an,amaz-

ing capacity for work. He has been
energetic. He has come up with
fresh ideas. He has carried the
work of three men. Yet his athletic
program seems to keep going back-
ward instead of forward.
Certainly it isn’t the fault of
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton.
The Captain has been an avid sup-
porter of intramural expansion.
Trouble is, there is no place to
expand to. To make matters worse,
the University seems to be losing
the few fields and gym sites which
it has possessed. Thus, what we
have is not an athletic expansion,
5 but a contraction.
Lights Out
Bemis took over his post in the
fall of 1947. He felt out the situa-
tion for a year and then decided to
install lights on Ellsworth field
“so as to allow more IM football
games to be played. The lighting
people came and dug the pits; they
installed the wiring; they brought
. the towers.
1 Atgthat point the residents of
Shadyside said no, and went to

 court.

   
   

   

 
  

   

  
   

   
   
   
   
 

Night football at Ellsworth would
cause noise, they said. It would
create parking problems.‘It would be
a ‘general nuisance. Besides, it
would cause land values to drop.

So the Ellsowrth project died.

The next year Bemis obtained
Schenley Oval for football games.
At the same time the Veterans Ad-

‘ ministration stepped in and took
over Trees field for the purpose of
building a vets’ hospital. The VA
warned, too, that in time it would
also tear down Trees gym to make
room for further construction. .

Bemis consigned himself to that
dark prospect with the consolation

  
   

 

he woold have the» gym for at
least another basketball season,
and maybe’ next year Pitt’s new
field house might be completed to
relieve the crisis.

But no. Some careless engineer
or bricklayer or somebody had to
go and lay a lot of cement on Trees
field in such a fashion that it ran
right down the hill to Trees gym,
where it seeped through the floors
and made itself at home.

Before Bemis knew what had
happened, his last retreat was com-
ing apart at the seams. This was
the climatic blow. The house was
figuratively and almost literally
falling in on him.

Patient Man»

Now Bemis is a patient man,
more so than the average person.
He has calmly directed a, multitude
of projects with no regard for the
eight-ho/ur working day, while a lot
of cranky intramural participants
griped that why does Bemis post-
pone this game or tack on that
game? Through it all, our depart-
ment has not once heard him com-
plain.

Fortunately, the engineers re-
opened the gym this week, announc-
ing that the only corrective mea-
sure necessary would be the in-
stallation of a new gas pipe. Per-
haps the gas pipe is being put in
for Bemis’ convenience in the event
that another calamity arises.

Although set back by Gettysburg
and Indiana Teachers in the first
two meets of the 1949-50 season,
Coach Rex Pe,ery’s wrestlers in-
vade Columbus with high hopes of
pinning the Ohio State matmen for
their first victory tomorrow.

Pitt's grapplers, who lost to
..Gettysburg, 20-6, in the inaugural,
showed a marked improvement even
though losing to Indiana, 16-12,
aiweek later.

Coach Peery believes that the
Pitts can break into the win col-
umn if the matmen continue to show
the improvement and interest they
have exhibited in the revived sport
thus far this season. This opinion
is based on the good physical con-
dition of the grapplers as well as
the decided improvement shown by
the entire team. «

Leading the Blue and Gold in
team points are Ray Cappelli, 128-
pounder, and the 165-pound Doc
Cpnklin, who have six each. Both
are undefeated with two decisions
over their respective opponents.

The probable team for tomorrow's
meet:

121 pounds - Dan Richards

128 pounds -- Ray Cappelli

Out-of-Shape Tankers
To Open at KentState

By STAN SKIRBOLL

"We’re out of condition, but we'll win,” was the general con-
census among the Pitt swimming team, as they prepared to open
the 1950 season tomorrow against Kent State at Revenna, Ohio.

The tankers, who have been hampered this last month by the

lack of a practice site, have not
been able to get into "good enough

shape to suit themselves. Ever
since the cracking up of ancient
Trees Gym, the swimmers have

been without a place to practice.

The mermen spent their Christ-
mas vacation with the responsiblity
of practicing on their own. Arrange-
ments have now been made, how-
ever, to use the YMHA pool for the
remainder of the season.

"This is to our advantage,” ex-
plained Grady, “for the Eastern
Collegiate Swimming Meet will
take place in a 25-yard tank. The
Y pool is 25 yards, while'Trees
pool was only 20 yards.”

“The only disadvantage to the
Y tank,” one swimmer said, His
that it is much slower than Trees
pool. The gutters at the Y do not
take off the crest of the waves,
which eventually will slow down
our times.” '

The Panthers are slated for two
meets at the Y, the extent of their
1950 home season. An original 11-
meet schedule was cut to eight
meets due to lack of facilities and
cancellations from-other schools.

Now that xGrady’s biggest worry
is over, and his swimmers will
have a place to keep in condition,
the coach can turn his atten-
tion to style and form of individ-

uals.

The Pitt team only lost four men
via the graduation route, and have
a strong group of sophomores that
will help balance the team that
only lost one dual meet last year.

Grady will take about 14 swim-
mers with him for tomorrow’s in-
augural. The group will be headed
by last year’ s sparkplug, Dick Petro,
and sophomore Jimmy Zentgraf.

Zentgraf will give the Panther§
the much needed power in the dist-
ance events, something that was
lacking on last year’s squad.

Al Ciocca, ECSA diving champ, .
will not’ compete in 'tomorrow’s
meet.The ceiling at the Kent State

He retainediurisdiction in the case
so that he might ascertain the re-
sults of the “hard-surface order.”

The decision was divided into
four other parts. The fraternity is
to supervise the lot to keep out-
siders offand tokeep incqnvenience
at a minimum. There will be no
parking after midnight orbefore day-
light. The court will retain juris-
diction. The cost of the case will
be born by the fraternity.

This last item in a generally
favorable Phi Kappa decision has
caused some adverse discussion
among the fraternity actives.

Judge Thompson charged what
noise there was to “youthful ex-
huberance and lack of care on the
part of_ the cbfendants.”

Phi Kappa attorney Robert A.
Jarvis feels Ehat the decision is a
complete victory for the fraternity.
