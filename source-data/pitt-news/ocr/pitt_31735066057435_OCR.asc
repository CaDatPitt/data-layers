Cuba

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

If you have turned on a tele-
vision or flipped through a
magazine in the past couple
of weeks, then you probably
know there is a “Cuban cri-
sis.”

Last night, amongst posters
on the ground floor of the
Cathedral of Learning pictur-
ing suffering Cubans, Pitt
professors, a U.S. senatorial
candidate and students dis-
cussed the issues of the cur-
rent Cuban situation at a town
meeting.

Pitt professor Dr. Jose
Morano spoke at the meeting,
mostly about his personal ties
to Cuba.

“Only recently, two of my
cousins came here on rafts
because of the current eco-
nomic situation in Cuba,”
Morano said. “This economic
crisis that we now have in
Cuba is one that has been arti-
ficially created by the Clinton
administration.” N

Morano is referring to the
current policy being conduct-
ed by the United States
against Cuba, an island about
90 miles north of Miami, Fla.
Currently there are strict trav-
el restrictions and a trade
embargo being forced on
Cuba. This has come about
because President Clinton has
been trying to help the coun-
try establish a democracy.

In recent months, the policy
has come under scrutiny
because of the mass exodus
of Cuban refugees to the
United States. Just this week
alone, over 1,200 Cubans
have been picked up by the
U.S. Coast Guard in the

Judgeru/es in favor of/W. Graham Coalition

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

It took a four-day hunger
strike to get the attention of
the courts, but on July 28 a
federal district judge ruled in
favor of the Mt. Graham
Coalition and issued a perma-
nent injunction on further
construction of the University
of Arizona telescope project.

Arizona Judge Alfredo
Marquez ruled that the
injunction would stay until

the university “complied with
federal environmental and
cultural law,” according to a
press release- issued on Aug.
30.

At a Pittsburgh Mt. Graham
Coalition press conference on
June 29, it was announced
that the University of Arizona
was illegally cutting down
trees in a restricted area on a
permit given by the U.S.
Forest Service.

A hunger strike followed in
order to gain the attention of

those involved.

The result was that the uni-
versity agreed to delay the
removal of trees until a feder-
al district court could decide
the legality of the project.

Commenting on what the
injunction means, Mt.
Graham Coalition member
Matt Peters said, “The courts
aren’t buying the University
of Arizona’s b.s. any more.”

Peters also said even
though Marquez donates a lot
of money to the university as

well as being a season ticket
holder, the judge still has a
problem with what the uni-
versity is doing.

“In his ruling, he did say he
was convinced by what the
environmentalists had to say,”
Peters said.

According to a press release
quoting a New York Times
article, Marquez also ruled
that the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the U.S.
Forest Service had “over-

New Piﬂ‘ law dean has plans but

is still moving in

By Susan Perfater
For The Pitt News

He’s still moving in, with boxes filling one comer
of his office and no blinds on the windows.

Certificates suggesting his previous elevated posi-
tions do not exist in plain view. However, there are
probably more important things for a new law
school dean to do than contemplate office decor.

Peter Shane, the new clean “for the University of
Pittsburgh School of Law, said he has been meeting
with alumni and sitting for interviews with
reporters. Some of his time is spent focusing on the
overall direction the law» school is going.

Shane said he would like to “make law school
cheaper.” He added that this involves scholarship

tional financial assistance given to graduating stu-
dents with loans to repay.

Shane is quick to point out that although there are
space problems and possible adjustments that need
to be made in the curriculum, there are no major
obstacles the school cannot collectively overcome.

“The issue to me isn’t ‘Do we have to change
something to avoid disaster?’” Shane said. “We
have a whole menu of opportunities in front of us.
The question is ‘Are we going to make the most of
them?”’

Shane received his bachelor’s degree in social
studies from Harvard University and graduated
from Yale Law School in 1977. In 1981, after three
years of government work, he began teaching as an
associate professor of law at the University of Iowa.
In 1985 he obtained complete professor status.

Shane said he left government service not because

he found fault with it, but because he felt experi-
enced enough at that time to pursue a teaching

C areer.

Sh “One of my goals is that [Pitt] have the reputation throughout this part of the state as being the most
ane

the °°'a“th°r of two books‘ ambitious, highest quality provider of continuing legal education to the bar,” Shane said.

Original when he was there and that he doubted
there would be any there at that time of night on
a Sunday.

Whiteside said that when asked to leave he
was told that his shirt was the wrong way to deal
with racism and that people who wear shirts like
that have no ethics.

Whiteside and his friends left, and he went
back 15 minutes later to speak to the manager.

“The manager told me that people who wear
these shirts have no ethics,” Whiteside said.

Whiteside said he disagrees with the manag-
er’s comment that the shirt is the wrong way to
deal with racism.

“To me, it’s a big problem that needs a strong
statement,” Whiteside said. “I really think it’s
relevant statement.”

Simon responded to the incident by emphasiz-

ing that he is against racism, but that he just
doesn’t like the word “fuck”

“I’m against racism,” Whiteside said. “In fact,
the [Original] is one of the most liberal bars in
Oakland. I just don’t like that word.” _

Simon said the T—shirt reminded him of the
heavy metal group Body Count song, “Cop
Killer,” that caused a controversy 1991 with
lyrics about shooting police.

“That’s why there is so much vio1ence,”
Simon said. '

Simon said he is not against the freedom to use
the word or wear it but that if it is used that it
should be small and “maybe something hidden
where young kids can’t see it.”

“That’s insulting people using that word,”
Simon said. “Somebody wants to get rich
putting out that garbage. That’s a good way to
get rich.”

He has also had 20 articles

Shane said he believes the

He said he considers it very

Cuba

°From page 1
Florida Straits.

According to the Pittsburgh
Cuba Coalition, the group that
sponsored the meeting, this
policy has resulted in a war on
Cuba. The first speaker of the
night, John Cox, spoke about
this issue. Cox, who ran for
mayor of Pittsburgh in 1993, is
the Socialist Party’s candidate
for senator of Pennsylvania in
this year’s election.

“This is a policy that has
remained consistent for nine
presidential administrations,
[and] currently it is the most
serious threat of war against
Cuba since the Bay of Pigs
invasion,” Cox said.

“Over 7,000 U.S. soldiers
have been sent to Gauntanamo
Bay in the past month alone,”
added Cox.

Cox said the reasons for the
U.S. policy towards Cuba
stem from fear.

“U.S. businesses are threat-
ened by the Cuban revolution,
and I think this continuing
example of a socialist revolu-
tion will bring fear to a capi-
talist society like we have here
in the Western Hemisphere,”
he said.

Pitt students were also pre-
sent at the meeting, mostly to

try and ﬁnd out what is going
on in Cuba.

“I think it is human nature to
find out about what is going
on in the world,” said Jed
Miller.

Another student, Adam
Ford, came to the meeting
because he feels Cuba is being
treated unfairly.

“It’s pretty ridiculous. We’re
obviously killing off the whole
country. We are actually com-
mitting genocide on the Cuban
people. I think it’s about time
it stops,” Ford said.

Jim Cason, a member of the
Pitt community, said he was at
the meeting because he feels
Cuba is being treated unfairly.

“I don’t think the embargo is
a good idea. We should not be
isolating Cuba because they
have a lot to offer the [United
States] by way of example,

like health care, for one,”
Cason said.

Another issue brought up at
the meeting was the travel
restriction being imposed on
Cuba. According to Lisa
Valanti, founder of the
Pittsburgh Cuba Coalition,
Cubans visiting family mem-
bers, in the United States are
being sent to jail. In addition,

stepped their bounds in
approving the site change on
Dec. 7.

Within hours of that earlier
decision, the university
cleared about 250 trees.”

Reacting to the judge’s rul-
ing on the injunction,
University of Arizona lawyer
David Todd told The New
York Times the injunction had
caused a delay that could
unravel a consortium backing
the $60 million telescope.

This brings up the “possi-
bility the telescope may have
to be outside the United
States,” Todd said.

“It looks pretty grim for the
telescopes. This decision rep-
resents a change,” Peters
said. “I feel pretty good [the
change] will continue.”

The latest injunction strikes
another blow to a project that
has been a source of contro-
versy ever since Congress
passed legislation in ‘I988
allowing the construction of

the first three of seven tele-
scopes on Mount Graham.

The site, about 100 miles
northeast of Tucson, is home
to the endangered Mt.
Graham red squirrel and‘ is a
sacred site for the San Carlos
Apaches.

The University of
Pittsburgh, one of many uni-
versities approached to invest
money in the telescope pro-
ject, announced April 6 that
it would not be investing.

“With the loss of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
potential $15 million invest-
ment in April, and now the
injunction which will delay
the project for years, the
U.A. will have to put their
scopes elsewhere,” Peters
said. “If they [the UA and the
Forest Service] had simply
followed the law, none of this
would have happened. The
mountain ecosystem would
not have been damaged, and
the university could have
saved millions of dollars.”

Freshman Tabitha Wilk has just complet-
ed her first week of classes at Pitt.
A Before classes started, she said she was

i nervous about finding all of her classes and

getting there on time. Wilk said she ‘had no
problems and her classes are all really
good. i

“I don’t expect any problems, just a lot of
work,” she said. “My teachers are all real
nice  My chemistry teacher is [foreign]
and talks real fast, but he’s real sweet.”

Classes haven’t been the only thing on
Wilk’s schedule. She said she decided not
to rush a sorority this year, but she is not
going to forget that option in the future.

Wilk did decide to try out for the Heinz
Chapel Choir and should know today
whether she made it or not. She said she is
also participating in the Emerging Leaders
program, and she signed up for community
service.

Last Thursday night, Wilk attended the
74th annual Lantern Night, a ceremony for
freshman women, in the Cathedral of
Learning. “l was on the news. My grandma
said she saw me,” she said. “It was really
nice.”

And on Saturday she went to the Pitt
football game against the Texas
Longhorns.

“I loved it. It was fun. I loved when the
Panther stood there and his tail went round
and round,” she said.

say your activities fee is spent
on things that don’t affect you?
Well ........... .. get used to it. .
But hey, even if J. Dennis

will never know you from
Adam, Pitt is not above letting
our dear radio station, WPTS,
present an evening of thought-
provoking international music
on our campus. |t’s a start.
Next Tuesday, four groups
will appear in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room. Their
music spans the far reaches of
the globe, from the other place
_down under, to the Great
White North, coming back to
our own backyard.
Pittsburgh musicians have
always possessed a penchant
for popping up on the scene,

  

Canadian indie folk punk activists, Mecca Normal.

making some noise and disap-
pearing without much of a
trace. This is the tale of one of
them. in the late ‘80s, a Bethel
Park High student named Paul
Petrosky began releasing
homemade cassettes under
the moniker Weird Paul. Living
up to his name, his songs jux-
taposed hardcore music with
silly, juvenile lyrics.

In 1991, Paul became the
first local indie musician to
land a deal with a national
label. His warped visio.ns
charmed the hearts of the folks
at Homestead Records, who
were at the time one of the
most consistent independent
labels in the country. That year
they released Lo Fidelity, Hi
Anxiety. But by 1992, the label

dropped him, and it seemed
that Weird Paul fell off the face
of the earth.

Well, he’s back from the
suburbs, if not with a
vengeance, with a new per-
spective. Big Ten Rex, the
local label responsible for Karl
Hendricks’ Some Girls Like
Cigarettes EP, has released ‘‘I
Was A Teenage |dealist.” Has

three years of married life
calmed Weird Paul any?
Come and find out.

People have said Mecca
Normal vocalist Jean Smith is
an “angry woman,” as if that's
a bad thing. Well, I respond.
after seeing the way womer
are treated, wouldn’t you be?

Fear Of A Black Hat
written and directed
by Rusty Cundieff

“Fear of a Black Hat,” which
opens up tomorrow night at
the Beehive, is a hilariously hip
look into the often madcap and
generally misunderstood sub-
culture of rap music.

The movie, which will keep
you in a state of laughter, is
written by, directed by and
stars Pittsburgh’s own Rusty
Cundieff.

The main characters of the
film are Ice Cold, Tasty-Taste
and D.J. Tone Def.’These
three rappers come together to
form the group N.W.H. (Niggaz
With Hats).

Cold, who is played by
Cundieff, is the group’s fast-
talking, philosophizing leader.
Cold reminds one of the actor

‘SEPTEMBER 8 1994

 

|ce—T. Cundieft’s other acting
stints include Spike Lee’S
“School Daze.”

Taste, played by Larry B.
Scott, is the short-tempered
sergeant-at—arms. Taste is a
militant ammunitions and
weapons enthusiast who has
his own outdoor shooting
range. With his Geri curl and
stupid style of dress, Taste is
a cross between Easy E and
Flavor Flav.

D.J. Tone Def (Mark
Christopher Lawrence) is the
group’s heavyweight spiritual-
lst who doesn’t have any com-
mon sense. He is the type of
person who reminds one of
the Big Dumb Young up the
street.

Kasi Lemmons plays Nina
Blackburn, a sociologist com-
pleting her doctoral disserta-
tion on the underbelly of rap.
Throughout the movie her
unflinching eye captures
N.W.H.’s demented yet social-
ly significant essence.

This movie reminded me of
CB4, a story about three rap
singers from Low Cash, star-
ring Chris Rock. Fear of a
Black Hat pokes fun at the
images of hard-core rappers,
thus using different methods.

“My sense of humor is
rather off-beat. It is way off
from what most black comedy
writers do,” Cundieff said
while discussing the film.
“Still, based on the video,
executives at ITC
(Entertainment Group produc-
tion) expressed interest in
working with us. We didn’t
have a script, just the video
and a synopsis, but ITC
agreed to outline and the
actors started rehearsing . I
wrote the script while we were
already in production. It was a
lot of hard work, but it actually
turned out to be the best of
two worlds — spontaneity and
control.”

The funniest part was a
scene with the white rapper.
As the white rapper walked
into N.W.H.’s dressing room
before a concert, he told them
about his so—ca||ed black
experience, an experience
that N.W.H. didn’t want to
hear. Then, all of a sudden,
he called them his Niggaz.
That’s when the shit hit the
fan, and they proceeded to
kick his ass.

His ass wasn't the only one
that they kicked. Throughout
the movie, this group saw
seven of their managers bite
the dust. Rumor has it that
they had something to do with
their deaths.

Fear of a Black Hat on the
surface seems stupid, but if
you take the time to listen to
what is said l’l| bet you'll like
it.

This was one of the funniest
movies that I have seen in a
long time. As a matter of a
fact, it is better than CB 4.!

Hungry for Stink
L7
Slash/Reprise

The women of L7 are the
epitome of raunch — playing
heaw, come-hither rock while
sporting tight pants with “Iips”
sewn to the crotch area. I
want to like them, really. Yet I
find that I cannot. Punk as
they are visually, their music is
just darn ordinary. Sure, it’s
kinda hard, kinda sexy, but it’s
been done before, and it
wasn’t even that good the first
time around. Hell — Poison’s
got them beat as far as sound
goes.

There’s no getting around it
— this record particularly
sucks. It took a good deal of
stamina for me just to listen to
the whole rotten, repetitive
thing. First of all, the lyrics are
incredibly stupid. Example:
“Down in North Hollywood

there’s a guy with long hair, P

and he's really, really, nice.”
That’s a direct quote from the
first song on the album,
“Andres.” Actually, “Andres” is
the most tolerable song on the
album —- almost worth a lis-
ten. Even so, it still hasn't an
ounce of originality. This
music is about as basic as it
gets — just generic rock and
roll. Plus the vocals sound all
strained, not even in some
cool Janis Joplin emotionality,
just in a lame “my voice is not
very strong or very good” sort
of way. '

The only cool thing about
this band is that it’s all female.
It's quite a shame that they're

getting publicity and big book'- ’

ings (i.e. Lollapalooza), when
there are so many other all-girl

heavy rock bands who are infi-V

nitely superior. Seven Year
Bitch would be just one exam-
ple.

So if you’re in the mood to
hear weak vocals, cheesy gui-
tar riffs and piss-poor rhymes,
or if you’re just plain Hungry
For Stink, pick this baby up
‘cause it’s definitely stinkin’.

Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess Age
Public Enemy .
Def Jam Recordings

Suburbian sell-outs, Feds
and white devils, dope-
smokin’ gangstas, shit-talking
media critics and most of all,
perpetrators of black-on-black
violence: step off -—— way, _way
dafucback — because PE’s
back and their black power
gospel is gonna getcha. First,
jump five years to the last day
of the 20th century and dig the
album’s premise — president
David Duke of the United
World States of EuroAmerica,
the New World Order, has

declared war on African Unity,
and Chuck D’s mission is to
protect the people by any
means necessary. The not-so-
futuristic scenario works well
to forefront problems PE has
with American society (for
example, the proliferation of
guns, gang banging, drug
dealing and the seIf-destruc-
tive indulgence in such activi-
ties) and allows Chuck, Flava
and Terminator X to dis
wacked concepts like
Columbus Day, the Star
Spangled Banner and the
Pledge of Allegiance.

On one level, the album
functions as good ole’ “911 is
a Joke” fun (“What Kind of
Power We Got?”), clap-clap
kinesis (“Give it Up” and
“Living in a Zoo Remix”),
urgent siren-infused funk,
(“WhoIe Lotta Love”) and
goofy sci-fi soul led by PE’s
hip hop hoodlum, Flava Flav
(who recently accumulated his
24th citation for driving without
a license). So, there is ample
muse-sick in this mess-age;
but closer to Chuck D’s “fuck

the 40-ounce” concerns, the
rhyme animal reemerges as a
furious activist/educator with
an entire nation to wake up.
Indeed, this lecture is as
focused as any previous
Public Enemy album — serv-
ing as precise intellectual
bombs that would make
Eldridge Cleaver proud.

Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess
Age, PE’s fifth album, is soni-
cally scattered, a shotgun blast
at a broad target audience. PE
added a reggae flavor “Thin
Line Between Law and Rape,”
placed a bit more emphasis on
‘70s blaxploitation funk, mel-
low Soul Train choruses and
even delves into spoken word
poetics laid over a montage of
old PE snippets (“They Used
to Call it Dope”). But watch out
because some stray bullets
(“What Side you On?” and
“Bedlam 13:13”) both annoy-
ingly repetitive —— and boring
— will leave gange-green
inducing shrapnel in your CD
player. In fact, “What Side You
On?” is undeniably the worst
song on the CD, with a chorus

of angry freedom fighters
demanding over and over
“What muthafuckln side you
on?” While it is not only dull
and repetitious, the song remi-
nisces mob-like terror with an
“us/good versus them/bad”
mentality, simplistically backed
by a tired bump-bumb bass
track. I

But the album redeems itself
with house-rockin soul power
on “What Kind of Power We
Got” and, using Chuckie’s ter-
minology, several “airstrikes
from the airwaves.” PE is at
their best when they return to
familiar conscious-raising terri-
tory on “Aintnuttin’ Buttersong”
(referring to “The Star
Spangled Banner” as nothing
but violent, militaristic propa-
ganda). It samples Jimi
Hendrix’s spangled riffs and
ends with PE’s own power-to-
the people interpretation of
America's flag: “The red is for
the blood that we shed/ the
blue is for those sad-assed
songs that we be singing in
church/ the stars is what we
saw when our ass got beat/

stripes is for the whip marks in
our back/ the white is for the
obvious, there ain't no black in
that flag.”

The evaluation and subse-
quent dismissal of American
icons and rituals continues on
“Hitler Day,” which parallels
Columbus Day and “Hitler
Day” as holidays of absurdity.
“Why are we, as a people,
forced to celebrate days like
Columbus Day,” the liner notes
state, “when it kicked off 500
years of genocide. That’s as
crazy as celebrating Hitler
Day.” Obviously, ideological
confrontation has remained
the driving force behind PE’s
funk and the band knew how
to deliver.

Although lacking “Fear of a
Black P|ai1et’s” relentless wail-
ing and the snide poetics from
“Nation of Millions,” the raps
do offer a semi-appealing evo-
Iution on wax. Public Enemy is
lyrical sociology, Muse Sick is
simply a cheap textbook, and
Chuck D is a damn good pro-
fessor.

The Seagull

Written. by Anton Chekhov
Directed by:Tracy Ginder-
Delventhal

Performed by Grex Theater
Studio»Theater

243-8927

The Seagull soars through a
solid three hours of sheer
Chekhov psychoanalytic feast.
The play rises over a number
of subjects such as ‘pure the-
ater,’ mocking actors as a
group and leaving a commen-
tary of what they should be,
envy of talent that can'con—
sume the soul and destructive
love.

The beautiful script buoys
the play. At times it plays con-
science, reminding the audi-
ence to keep its principles 
and its heart.

Light and dark, good and
evil, yin and yang are repre-
sented in the forms of Irina
(Jeri Misler) and Nina (Jenna
Kalinowski) who end up in love
with the same man, Boris
Alekseyevich Trigorin (Thom
Deventhal), and in doing so,
drive another (Kostantin,
played by Jeff Carpenter) to
desperate measures.

Irina, Kostantin’s mother,

cannot accept her son’s true
worth. Hell, she cannot accept
anything that doesn’t serve her
immediate gratification. Enter
Trigorin, an unhappy writer,
who allows her to dominate the
part of his life he has set aside
for the female touch. A former
actress, she uses vulgar, tact-
less outbursts to grasp her
audience’s attention, but rarely
receives its pity. She is a frag-
ile, insecure woman in the
guise of a confident socialite.
Her polar opposite, Nina,
enters the play as Kostantin’s
girlfriend, as uncaged in shar-
ing her dreams as she is with
her love. A creature of soul,
she never perceived that in
chasing her dreams she could
get burned. in all her naivete,
her innocence is created and
destroyed during the course of
the play. The audience sees
her character take flight per-
forming with the theater she
has become so caught up in.
and destroyed by the man she
most admires and is brought
closer to by this tragic art.
Every woman in this play is
in love with the wrong man.

Every man in this play hurts
the woman who loves him the
most. No one is allowed to get
off emotionally easy in this
play. Especially the audience.
This four-act confuses and
melds random acts of love.
Masha (Bryn Jameson) is in
love with Kostantin, who all but
despises her. So she marries
a teacher (Juan Rivera) who is
close to him, but whom she
doesn’t love. The reasoning
behind actions like this are
never fully explained. Chekhov
loved this narrative realism.
The sets are rough, but

\.-\

appropriate for a 19th century
Russian country estate. The
closeness the audience is
allowed in the limited space of
the Studio Theater draws them
into the character’s lives.
Jenna Kalinowski shines as
Nina. Her subtlety is startlingly
real, and her sincerity is gen-
uine. Jeri Misler’s boisterous
character is a terrific success
as Nina’s foil. Her cattiness is
just right in a part that could be
easily overdone. Thom
De|venthal’s Trigorin is decid-
edly inconstant, as he should
be, but at the end one has to

strain closer to get what his
character is really saying.
However, the supporting
actors get lost in the shuffle by
the end scene in Kostantin’s
study, and the audience is
given little chance to care
about what happens to them.
The Seagull opens Grex
Theater’s first season with a
study of the classic. Actors can
look at this as a commentary
on their art, while everyone
else can relate to it, thanks to
Chekov, as a commentary on
their lives. The Grex Theater
will perform it at the Studio

Comatose. That’s the state
that everyone was in when this
group dropped their first

about the last was “Fudge
Pudge”; but on that joint, it
was O.C. (whose debut single,
“Time’s Up”, is smashing the
underground) who stepped up
and tooked charge. Everyone
just stepped past their first sin-
gle; but with a title like “Who
Stole My Last Piece Of
Chicken?”, wouldn’t you?

Well, in ‘94, O.K. will not be
ignored. With the first single,
“Stress,” they’ve awakened a
lot of people to let them know
it’s time to prove, not show and
tell. The flipside remix (not
found on the album), which
features Large Professor on
the beat and the rhyme, is
even phatteri than the original,
which was astounding to begin
with.

Poetry flips shit mad through-
out the entire album, but the
standout cut that represents
the ill styles these brothers
possess is “Bring It On.” To
write down the lyrics to this
song would do it an injustice,
because, although the lyrics
are crazy phat, the style is so

intertwined with them that the I

lyrics themselves wouldn’t
have the same impact. Point
blank, if nothing else, you
have to hear that song. l’ll tell
you this much: Monch sets it
off incredibly. Other standouts
are “Thirteen”, ‘‘Black
Sunday,” “Drop Bombs,”
“Why,” “Maintain,” “Keep It
Koming,”. and _ “Let’s
Organize” which features O.C.
on the rhyme and Q-Tip on
the hook.

The album overall is tight,
but there are some problems.
For one, this album doesn’t
rely on the music, which, in
itself, poses a dilemma. On
the positive end, it allows you
to focus on the lyrics and see
that they can more than hold
their weight. On the negative
end, if the music doesn’t grab
you, you may sleep on the
whole thing, so the album may
not stand a chance. Another
problem is that Monch is very
noticeably stronger with the
lyrics than Prince P0 is; not
saying that Po doesn’t have it
(he definitely holds his own),
but you’ll look for Monch on
every cut.

If you’re into lyrics as much
as I am, you should definitely
peep it. If not, this album is like
the last one as far as you’ll be
concerned. '

Artist: Gravediggaz

Album: 6 Feet Deep
Producer(s): Prince Paul,
RZA, RNS, Mr. Sime

label: Gee Street/Island/PGD
rating: @@@@

For the real heads in the
audience, let’s briefly trace the
history of each member.
Prince Paul (Undertaker) and
Fruitkwan (Gatekeeper) are
original members of the first
hip hop band Stetsasonic
(who, according to Daddy-O,
are still together working on an
album for release at a later
date on an unnamed label).
Paul, brings forth De La Soul,
and gets mad props as a pro-
ducer. The RZA (Rzarector;
formerly Prince Rakeem) was
first presented to the nation as
the world’s first ordinary gigolo
(he was the dirtiest person in
his video with beautiful women
flocking all over). When
TOMMY Boy pulled the plug
on his career, he resurfaced
with a clique of eight more rap-
pers and became one of the
most talked about groups out
with a gold plus record hang-
ing ‘on his wall. He, too,
became sought after as a pro-
ducen “

are a true hip op
you gotta remember Too
Poetic (Grym Reaper). Under
Tommy Boy's notorious “sin-
gle-first—album-maybe” deals,
he released a phat joint
(around 1988) called “God
Made Me Funky.” The lyrics
and rhymestyle are now dated,
but the beat can rock at any
party!’Tommy Boy booted him,
and he was never seen again
until now.

the Gravediggaz “horror-

Deep", “2 Cups Of Blood”).
That’s just the gimmick to rope
you in. You can’t just go on the
first single, “Diary Of A
Madman”, which has one of

:-"5

   

A the most evil (meaning eerie,

angry, creepy) tracks that I've
heard and harbors lyrics of
maniacal murder.

|t’s a freestyle album with a
catch. Grym Reaper (Poetic) is

‘ the strongest rhymer out of the

group (my objective opinion).
On “Here Comes The
Gravediggaz”, he flips it like:
“You don’t pull on
Superman’s cape/ you don’t
spit into the  wind/ you pull
the mask off the old Lone
Ranger/ and you  can’t fuck

 
   

with me and my men  Boom
bip competition ain't shit/ fakin’
the funk like silicone tits 

The Rzarector is no slouch
on the rhyme either. On “Blood
Brothers,” he adds a little auto-
biography with a touch of
humor:

‘‘I grew up on the violent
island of Shaolin/ 55 Flowan
sixth floor, 10th door/ when
jackpot rock was hot I was not/
a rusty-ass child with tears and
snot/ acquired the knowledge
to master my thoughts/ my
skinny frail body cou/dn’t fuck
with the sports/ six-foot-two
still wack on the court/ so I
stalk New York with a black
pitchfork. ”

album is dope (except for

phat guest ‘vocalists Scientific

Even though the album is
crazy ill, Fruitkwan upsets the
balance. His rhymes aren’t

garbage, but he doesn’t fit the 
whole “Gravedigga” persona. If T

they would’ve rhymed over the
outro (“Rest In Peace”) and
kicked the track for “Deathtrap”
to the curb, this album would
be even tighter than it is now.
The Gravediggaz definitely
would not be a bad invest-

September 8 1994

Or should I say, why aren’t
you?

Smith channels her hostility
into lyrics which display a
resentment towards people on
the street who catcall her
(“Come with me/ I know/ you
like to suck and fuck”), and a
strength that indicates she
won’t stand for such treat-
ment.

Next to Smith, guitarist
David Lester balances rhythm
and lead duties on his guitar.
Playing the only instrument in
the band seems like quite a
task, but his playing perfectly
complements his partner’s
poetic work.

The duo formed in 1986
when Lester and Smith met at
a Vancouver newspaper.
Since then, they have
released five albums and a
wealth of singles, most of
which appear on the K label.
In addition to her contributions
to Mecca Normal, Smith
released a book last year,
appropriately entitled, I Can
Hear Myself Fine. If you can’t
hear the vocals next Tuesday,
yell for the soundman to turn
up Smith’s voice.

Trash and Peter Jeffries, the
other two acts on the bill, hail
from the thriving music scene
in New Zealand. Jeffries was
part of the country’s early pop-
punk movement when he and
his brother formed The

. Nocturnals and later, This

Kind of Punishment, in the

‘ early ‘80s.

While playing in the latter
band, Jeffries began recording
at home on a four track
recorder, as opposed to work-
ing in the studio. The Io-fi
approach has become part

 

since then.

‘‘I don’t mix through a stack
of little black boxes to get that
professionally enhanced stu-
dio sound,” he said in 1992.
“Get the sound right on tape
first, then mix it. If you don’t
think the sound is good
enough, re—record until you
do.”

His early recordings have
appeared on New Zealand
labels such as Flying Nun and
Xpressway. Jeffries’ newest
album, Electricity, has been
released in the U.S. by the
Ajax label in Chicago.

Trash found its start back in
1986 playing occasional gigs
and, most notably, performing
a rock opera entitled “Trash
Hotel.” The piece allegedly
spooked both its audience and
performers who staged it in
the Dunedin Public Art
Gallery.

in 1989, the group solidified
their lineup when guitarists
Bruce Blucher and Paul Cahill
teamed up with ex-Verlaines
drummer Robbie Yeats. Like

Jeffries, Trash subscribes to '

the four-track approach, which

is how they recorded their'_

debut album Gritt and Butts. In
1992, a single and a two
tracks on a compilation fol-
lowed the album. The
American label New World of
Sound recently released
Trash’s sophomore album,
Not Gate. "

On their first American tour,
Trash’s music manages to
sound big despite the lack of a
bass player. Reviews have
mentioned the trio in the same
sentence as White LighVWhite
Heat, where folk music
dances with crazy drumming.

  Opinions

Smoking bans good

A few years ago, smoking was baimed on all commercial air-
line ﬂights. Since then, the right to smoke in public has been
rapidly decreasing. This trend has been met with joy by smoke

haters and decried by smokers as violation of their fundamental

ri hts.

gSome may argue that smoking bans are just another example
of Big Brother’s gaze upon our society. However, while we
strongly affirm that people have the right to decide for them-
selves whether or not to smoke, we are in favor of the increase in
smoking regulation.

The problem with smoking is it affects more people than sim-
ply the smoker. Studies have shown that inhalation of second-
hand smoke can be as deadly if not deadlier than smoking itself
and there are many people who are strongly bothered by ciga-
rette smoke. I

Few people have a problem with the government outlawing

A public drunkenness, disturbing the peace or other public actions

which bother or have the potential to harm other people.
Smoking is not significantly different and it could be argued is
even worse because of the risk of cancer.

The Pitt News applauds the actions of non-smokers who stood
up for their rights and succeeded in getting smoking regulations
passed. The era of the “smoke-filled room” has come to an end,
hopefully never to return.

Suggestions for Boyd

Finally, after nearly a year and a half, there is a director of the
Department of Public Safety at Pitt. The Pitt News would like
to welcome Rick Boyd to his new post and urge him to act
quickly on making Pitt’s campus a safer place. To that end we
have a few suggestions.

Pitt needs a stronger presence of cops on campus. There is
always a strong concentration of cops around the O’s comer, but
other than that they are hard to spot. Increased cop visibility,
especially in the form of beat patrols, would create a much safer
atmosphere for students walking the streets of North and South
Oakland at night.

Also more vans and phone operators are needed for van-call.
Many students who would like to use the service walk instead,
so they don’t have to deal with the hassle of trying to get
through and the often long wait for a van.

Another needed improvement is the reinstitution of publicly
displaying CrimeWatch reports. This would allow students to
see in what areas crimes occur in concentration and act accord-
ingly.

Finally we all must remember that Mr. Boyd can only do
so much. Pitt students need to also take the initiative to make
our campus a safer place. The Department of Public Safety
offers free seminars on campus safety that are very poorly
attended.

A greater concern by Pitt students in their own safety will go a

_long way toward ultimately making Pitt a safe campus.

W-courses are hard Io gel

. his is it, my ﬁnal semes-
j ’ ter as an undergraduate

at the University of
Pittsburgh. Come December,
my chances to voraciously
consume different bodies of
knowledge will come to an
end. Money and leisure time
will be scarce. Rather than
building and assimilating new
knowledge, I will need to lean
on that which is already in
place. -
My schedule this final fall
term requires me to take

; four classes in my major and

one writing section, not neces-
sarily in my major. This writ-

The head of the English Lit
department said it was impos-

I am not an unaccomplished
negotiator either, my situation
was simply not listened too,
cared about and in some cases
(the Dean’s office specifically)
met with open hostility. I have
just returned from the second
meeting of “Reading Poetry.”

request to enter the class. with

campus book store. I was
taken advantage of as usual,
but I wasn’t bitter because I
was too intent on savoring my
last semester at Pitt. After
ﬁnding my other books, I went
and succeeded in locating the
books for my writing section,
an English Lit class. (As any
veteran student or faculty
member knows, most writing
sections are English Lit class-
es) I was disappointed to find
that I had read all the required
books, ‘most of them in high
school. As building an educa-
tion requires challenges, I
knew I would have to choose
another class. .

tle about, something which
every “student” should know.
Furthermore it fit my schedule.

At the end of class I stated
my request for admission to
the class. The instructor
responded in much the same
way as a computer screen
would, “NO, I AM NOT PER-
MITTED TO EXCEED 22
STUDENTS. YOU MAY TRY
IN THACKERAY HALL TO
SEE IF SOMEONE DROPS.”
“No other output allowed”
seemed to logically follow but
it never came.

Thus my odyssey began as I
tried numerous ways to get my
foot in the door. Five different
offices in Thackeray Hall, as
well as numerous attempts in
the English department on the
fifth and sixth floor of the
cathedral. The Dean of CAS
doesn’t have an appointment

must feel a certain empathy
for, or familiarity with
what’s being said. Perhaps
I’m only rationalizing though.
At any rate I left the class
early on, counting 25 students
outside of myself all of
whom claimed to be regis-
tered. This is even more insult-
ing; obviously there exists
some elitist method of adding
the class which I am not privy
to.

I am now off to buy books I
have read long before. I must
manipulate the system to grad-
uate mustn’t I? I must re-read
“Robinson Crusoe” and feign
interest so PITT can kiss me
and my money goodbye come
Dec. 16.
