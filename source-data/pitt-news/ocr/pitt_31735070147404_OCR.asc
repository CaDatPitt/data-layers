Pitt honors future donors

University thanks donors who will give more than $1 million

Emily Riley
Staff Writer

Pitt recently inducted more than 60 in-
dividuals and groups into the newly es-

tablished Brackenridge Circle, a society‘ ‘

of donors who plan to make ﬁnancial
contributions to the University exceed-
ing $1 million.

The society will recognize donors
who assured their planned deferred gifts
through either bequests, trusts, life in-
surance or retirement plan assets — all
typically considered safe and reliable
forms of investments that might not be
available until after a donor retires or
passes away. -

The society recognized its inaugural
class early last month with an awards
ceremony at the Carnegie Museum of
Art.

Pitt Vice Chancellor for Institutional
Advancement Albert]. Novak said that
it is important to recognize those who

do make such signiﬁcant contributions V

to the University.

“Often times these gifts will not be
received by the University until after the
donor has died. Our primary goal with
the Brackenridge Circle is to publicly
honor these individuals for their extraor-

dinary contributions and care for Pitt,”
Novak said in an interview last week.
Donors include the 'Baierl family,
the Fu family and the Marous family,
as well as 63 other living benefactors.
Altogether, the society’s planned de-
ferred gifts will total $88 million for
the University. _ s
Novak said these contributions sup-
port various areas of the University
including endowed scholarships and
research funding, as well as the construc-
tion and renovation of facilities at the
school’s various branches. ,
Some donors approach the Univer-

_ sity with plans for where their donation

would go.

“In some cases, a donor has a very
clear idea of what they would like to do
and ‘in other cases, our development
officers help prospective donors learn
about the various ways they can support
the University, its faculty or students,”
Novak said. V

Donors can also give on behalf of a
family member or beloved faculty mem-
ber or “to address critical issues or needs
that they care about,” Novak said. Do-

Apples over coffee

Nutrition expert, students discuss alternative study aids

Dan Marchese
For The Pitt News

Though it might be convenient to buy a
large coffee or an energy drink to perk
up, experts say caffeine might not be the
best way to stay going during this hectic,
ﬁnals-ﬁlled time of year.

According to one dietitian, Nadiya
Timperman, the most effective way to stay
alert for the day is to adopt a surprisingly
simple concept: just eat an apple. She was
quick to add that it’s not so much the apple
that’s magical, but more the simple act of
eating breakfast that can help students
push though the end—of—semester rush.

Timperman is a registered dietitian
and nutrition educator in Ohio. She re-
lated eating breakfast to starting a ﬁre.

Timperman said eating healthy foods
like an apple or other fruits or vegetables
is like building a ﬁre with good ﬁrewood:

V The ﬁre will burn-strongly.and give off

light and heat — in other words, en-
eI'gY- .
Eating a healthy breakfast will make
the ﬁre burn steadily for a long time, she
said, whereas drinking coffee or eating
a donut or a mufﬁn for breakfast is like
building a ﬁre with newspaper. It will burn

bright and fast, ' giving your’ body a burst
of energy that doesn’t last.

Members of Pit_t’s student body re-
ported a wide variety of practices to stay
awake and alert while studying, but few

reported relying on fruit for these pur- '

poses.

Pitt junior Gabriel Cutler admitted to
skipping breakfast and opting for a cup of
coffee daily, and although he does make a
point of eating “a good amount of fruit,”
he does not do so to keep alert.

Senior Matt Timko said that he steers

‘clear of coffee but relies on energy drinks

like Red Bull and 5-Hour Energy to stay
awake when he needs to cram. Timko ad-
mitted that these drinks can be tough on
the body, even in moderation.

. Freshman Amanda Amen takes a
healthier approach to staying awake.
Amen said that she refrains from drink-
ing coffee and energy drinks both because
she wants to avoid the crash that goes
along with them and because she doesn’t
wantto rely on a substance. Instead, she
eats a good amount of fruit and takes
vitamins to help her stay awake during
crunch time.

Breakfast not overrated

Apples < 2

Speaking of tempting treats like do-
nuts, mufﬁns and lattes, Timperman said
that she is bafﬂed by people who rely on
sweet foods to start their day.

What confuses Timperman is that
“these same people walk up to the coun-
ter and order a 20-ounce mocha frappuc-
cino with whipped cream and caramel
and think that they’re making a smarter
choice than just ordering the donut that
they were drooling over.” .

Timperman said “there’s hardly an
difference in calories between the donut
we don’t eat on principle and those spe-
cialty drinks we order every day.”

She continued, asking, “why not just
get the donut and be happy?” '

Timperman did, however, stress the
fact that she does not completely con-
demn coffee as the root of all evil. She
admitted to “needing her morning cup of
coffee just like everybody else.”

She also took the time to explain how
coffee can be both good and bad for the
body. ‘ .

Coffee is a diuretic, meaning that it
shuts off a hormone in your body — aptly
named the antidiuretic hormone —— which
helps cells retain water. Drinking coffee
causes the body to get rid of water, which
can lead to dehydration, headaches and
muscle pain.

Timperman said the entire process is
actually very similar to drinking alcohol,
another popular diuretic which works
biologically in the same way.

“While caffeine is a drug, it is a be-
nign drug, and people regard it as such,”
Timperman said. “It’s the lesser of two
evils.”

She added that studies have shown that
low doses of caffeine daily can ultimately
lower risks of diabetes, kidney stones and
even Alzheimer’s disease. 

Donors can

nors Lucine and John Marous provide
an example of the latter.Both alumni
of the University Pittsburgh gave gifts
to help establish courses pertaining to
Catholicism.

“We are practicing" Catholics, and
we realized that a big proportion of the
student population is also Catholic. The
school needed a course in which this part
of the population can further the study of
their religion,” Lucine Marous said.

Both Lucine and John Marcus attend-
ed the award ceremony and said that it

This new society is not the only way
Pitt honors its numerous donors.The
Cathedral of Learning Society honors
donors who have already given gifts of
$1 million or more. The Chancellor’s
Circle is for those who make gifts total-
ing $1,000 or more each year. The Gold
Circle exclusively recognizes younger
alumni who give $500 or more annually.
The 1787 Society expresses gratitude
to planned deferred donations of any
amount. I ‘

police, one man produced a silver-colored

. handgun, and a second punched the victim
in the face and then demanded the victim’s

University attempts
to patch Leaks

Though we’re well aware that a profile
picture of oneself doing a beer bong
doesn’t look good to prospective em-
ployers, apparently posting or even dis-
cussing WikiLeaks on social networking
sites could be harmful as well. _

According to The Huffington Post, a
State Department ofﬁcial and alumnus
of Columbia University e-mailed that
university’s School of International
and Public Affairs this week saying
that “students who will be applying for
jobs in the federal government could
jeopardize their prospects by posting
links to WikiLeaks online, or even by
discussing the leaked documents on
social networking sites.” __

The school’s Office of Career Services
sent to its students an e-mail, which
said “engaging in these activities would
call into question your ability to deal
with confidential informationgwhich is
part of most positions with the federal
government.”

Because the State Department denies
any federal involvement in the e-mail,
we wonder why Columbia was so quick
to get behind the alumnus’ claims. .

According to The Huffington Post,
Philip]. Crowley, a spokesman for the
U.S. Department of State, said, “If an
employee of the State Department sent
such an e-mail, it does not represent a
formal policy position.”

Federal employees and contractors
were ordered this week not to View the
documents published by WikiLeaks or

other publications unless they have

authorization, according to The New
York Times.

This is_because the information ——
despite being posted on public websites
— is still considered classified.

Though it’s one thing for the gov-
ernment to order its employees not to
read the leaked documents, it’s another
to hold potential employees not under
contract to that same standard.

But as Crowley said, it’s not a formal
policy position. .

The Huffington Post reports that
“while republishfngthe leaked docu-
ments could indeed raise legal issues for
students, it was the admonition against
social media chatter that riled some at
Columbia.” - -

Because students at Columbia are

not current government employees, we ,

feel that they shouldn’t be expected
to keep its secrets — especially when
those “secrets” are currently available
to the public.

In addition, in an age in which young
people do not read and discuss current
events as frequently. as they probably
should, it seems wrong for an academic
institution to discourage discussion on
such a huge issue. _'

We especially find it interesting that
Columbia — a university with a promi-
nentjournalism school — is discourag-
ing the exercise of ‘First Amendment
rights. _ -

While we think it’s nice that Colum-
bia wants to protect its students’ job
prospects, the disadvantages of posting
are unclear.

Ultimately, students shouldbe en-
couraged to discuss current events,

The holiday season is prime time for social-
izing, counting one’s blessings and reflecting
on the past year. Unfortunately, some of that
time is likely spent reﬂecting on the fact that
some of your friends and family are people
you are thankful to see only once a year.
Let’s face it — every family has members we
would rather avoid. People who dress up like
KISS everyday, homeopathic folk—healing
born-agains and persons “slightly to the
right of Genghis Khan” in the words of my
uncle; all must be related to somebody. Odds
are some of them are related to you. .

Of course, none of them are related to —
me. All my relatives are perfectly nice and ~

column are. But based on those relatives
who don’t read this column, I can offer some
advice as to how to deal with people that
you can’t stand. '
The ﬁrst step is to realize that even
though some relatives might be acerbic,
- misanthropic, unpleasant, cynical and just
plain jerks, at least they can be occasionally
incisive and amusing. Like H.L. Mencken,
for instance; If someone is amusing, they be-

come less annoying and unpleasant. Seeing ,

someone as amusing is not too difficult. Can
you laugh at a racist reactionary who always
insists on sitting in the same chair, smoking
cigars and calling anyone who disagrees with
him a “meathead”? Well, if you’ve ever seen
the show “All In the Family,” you no doubt
did laugh at Archie Bunker. I

Kanye West is a waste of presidents’ time

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

Dang Kanye West! While Kim Jong Il

_...»was busy making platform shoes so he

could ride the big boy rollercoaster,
Kanye was busy being Kanye. As the
media has been in an uproar over the
feel and photo airline policy, Kanye was
busy snapping his own, well, intimate
pictures. Taylor, I’m going to let you
finish, but Kanye West had one of the
snarkiest “Today” show interviews ever!
Yes, other things have happened in the
world, but nothing compares to Kanye
being Kanye. _

Now if Kanye has taught us anything

«’ .—-about himself, it is that he has a big 

haha  ego. When he and Mike My-

ers were soliciting the good American .

people for a little bit of helpfor vic-
tims of Katrina, he called out George
W. Bush as someone who doesn’t care
about black people.

I imagine that Bush was pissed to

find out that his super secretive plan
ofbringing on Colin Powell and Condo-
leezza Rice didn’t pan out. I mean, that
plan seemed foolproof to me. ‘
I don’t know if you’ve already heard
 through the wire, but Bush has recently
said that Kanye West’s accusation of
racism was the lowest point of his presi-
dency. Uh, 9/11? Producing grammati-
cally correct sentences? Two wars? A
failing economy?.Did I mention 9/11? I

guess we’re all self—conscious, Bush is
just the first to admit it. Come on Bush.
If Taylor Swift, 50 Cent or other people
Kanye insulted didn’t take it personally,
you shouldn’t’either.

Kanye has certainly been living the
good life. He has recently released a new

tual news? I love Kanye but does that
mean that I think it’s acceptable for
him to be the cover story on a national
news network?

Honestly, it’s kind of pathetic.

I’ll leave it to Perez Hilton and E! to
tell me what Kanye thinks. We live in

Between Obama calling him a jack-

ass and now Bush viewing him as

the lowest point inhis presidency,

it seems like Kanye’s not-too good

with the politicians.

album and has made more headlines
than old age. He isentertaining and
doesn’t hesitate to give his opinion on
anything. From the law to how to treat
women, Kanye thinks he is an expert on
almost everything. V

As somebody who actually cares
about world events, I’m not sure ifI
should be outraged by Kanye’s attitude

_ and publicity or not. How-should we
feel when CNN is plastered with news '

about Lil Wayne’s jail sentence and
when it treats Kanye’s opinion as ac-

aworld where WikiLeaks is exposing
government secrets. Is Kanye’s exposing
himself equally important? Sadly, I have

to say no. Even considering how much I .

love Kanye West, I’m still going to have

to ask our politicians to ‘grow up.
Between Obama calling him a jackass

and now Bush viewing him as the lowest

point of hispresidency, it seems like '
' Kanye’s not too good with the politi-

cians. As I read all the backlash against
Kanye, I ﬁnd myself wondering why peo-
ple seem to care so much about him.

It’s not breaking news that MSNBC
and Fox News cover" stories that don’t re-
ally matter. It’s not the news networks’
fault that they give so much airtime to
dumb stories. It’s not their fault that
people would rather watch stories about
Kanye West. I’m not s-ayingthat they’re
all gold diggers, but they aren’t messing
with any broke stories. '

But clearly. it’s time that our presi-
dents refrain from getting involved.

_ I hold the office of the president to
the highest standards. I expect it to
represent my country and its ideals.
I expect it to defend my rights and to
respond to the threats posed to the
country. I expectfit to not giveva damn
what Kanye Westfsj-ays. It’_s despicable for
Obama to be caught ‘using obscenities
in describing an entertainer. I

It’s a complete disgraceto every sol-
dier who has given their blood and tears

— in the Middle East, to every person who

Watched their house flood and the_fed—
eral government do absolutely nothing
to help in the Gulf, to the millions of
Americans that had their homes fore-
closed and lifelong retirement dreams
dashed, to the men and women who
were ruthlessly killed on Sept. 11 in at-
tacks against our country and to the
minorities who truly did suffer as a re-
sult of misguided policy that George
Bush gives one damn‘ about what Kanye
West says.‘ '

yours aged 6 or younger in the other room.
Go ahead and help them build a snowman
or throw some snowballs in their direc-
' tion or something. The adults will love it
because it means the kids aren’t playing a
game of “let’s annoy Grandma,” and you’ll
love it because you’ll miss Archie Bunker’s
explanation of the world. If you don’t have
any young cousins, it is possible to create

loser. Whatever you decide, remember, you

have options.

Picking the correct topics of conversa-
tion and acting with generally appropriate
etiquette can save you a lot of troubleduring

- «::the season. Phrases rhyming with “brass

pole” or “coarse bit” should be avoided at
all times. Topics to avoid include religion,
politics and other relatives. Safer topics

include sports. Why else do you think they
play football on Thanksgiving? And why
does the game always involve the Detroit

pretty clear if you’ve paid attention over
the years. Good for you if you didn’t sleep
through all those family dinners!

Some of the people seated around your
holiday table might include the following:

The racist: This is a hard-to-deal—with
difﬁculty. Everyone feels a little awkward
telling this person he’s full of it. On the other
hand, nobody wants to vocally agree and
say things like “that’s right, white males
of Polish extraction are no good!” — es-
pecially not around my holiday table. The
best thing to do when faced with said in-
dividual is to be quiet, and perhaps make
moderating comments such as, “Well, they
don’t eat babies, do they? That seems a little

unlikely.” Deﬂection to another topic often
helps here, too. I -

The oddball: Maybe this person just
joined a cult that worships giant Wombats
and wants to convert you. Or perhaps they
believe salt crystals have magic powers that
are unknown to science or kept secret by evil
drug ﬁrms/the government. These folks are
usually a lot of fun, and when they aren’t,’ it’s

usually enough to invoke the great Midwest- I

ern phrase “Well, that’s kinda different,”
which odds are, it is. Then you can tune
out, as it is unlikely there will be a quiz. It is
usually a bad idea to tell them exactly how

wrong they are and so act like  well  like

H.L. Mencken, for instance. .

The nostalgics: These folks did some
amazing things in their lives._]ust ask them.
They lived through the Dee-pression, where
they thanked their lucky stars they were
born in the USA and that they could go to

school instead of working in the mills, which

weren’t hiring anyway. Children back then
respected their elders, by golly, and listened
to good, wholesome, morally upstanding
music like jazz unlike this rebellious crap
they play today, and, HEY, look at me when
I’m talking to you!

Yes, these stories are a bit boring — until
your older relatives die and you don’t hear
them anymore, and so an era’s memories
are lost to you. So shut up and listen, you
little whippersnapper! . ‘ '

A CONCERT REVIEW

  GT keeps it going ‘All Day,’ all night

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

Local mashup king Gregg Gillis, better known
as Girl Talk, makes remixes with the deftness
of a stage magician: Lose focus and you might
miss a sample. But, you’ll probably be too busy
dancing to care.

’ On Saturday night, before the second of
his two—day victory lap of Pittsburgh perfor-
mances, Girl Talk’s fans — bedecked in glow
sticks and hairspray —- were loose and ami-
able, enjoying the North Shore’s newlyminted
venue Stage AE. Naturally, some were drunk,
some were unruly and some ——- like the man
that leaned on my shoulder and conﬁded to
me that I looked like “a great friend who I’ll
never see again” — were in a mental realm
of their own.

Thankfully, all individual interaction — in
fact, all notions of individuality —— evaporated
when Pittsburgh’s premiere party—starter took
the stage. A

About 30 minutes after the two opening
acts — noisy electro-pop duo TM Eye and
boisterous Southern rapper Big K.R.I.T., both
of whom, if paired together, might resemble
something like Girl Talk — the lights dimmed,
the projection screen awakened and a voice,
at ﬁrst too low to be distinguishable, began
chanting: “Girl Talk  Girl Talk.” When its

pitch raised, the audience was quick to join
in the cheer.

Out hurried a lanky, long—haired man who
wouldn’t seem out of place at a grunge concert.
Clothed in a yellow sweatshirt and waving
the requisite terrible towel, he grabbed the
mic and hailed the already—euphoric crowd of
hometown devotees with the ﬁrst of his near-
innumerable big—ups to Pittsburgh. A stream
of lucky fans rushed onstage to join him. Gillis’
laptop —— the nexus of his noisemaking — was
set in motion.

Soon, Stage AE + a slick, industrial mini-
arena — was awash in bass, beats and ﬂailing
limbs, and akiller remix of the Wu—Tang Clan’s
“C.R.E_.A.M.” had everyone in a’9os rap ﬁmk.
Supplementing the revelry were balloons, gi-
ant, inﬂatable tubes and stage crew-manned
toilet—paper dispensers that produced oddly
beautiﬁil showers of snow—white tissue. Some-
how, the energy level never dipped. '

To enumerate Gillis’ samples —— Phoenix’s
“19o1”; Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s “Shimmy Shimmy
Ya”; The Darkness’ “I Believe in aThing Called
Love” — belies the fact that, in a Girl Talk
show, all songs are rendered anew, almost
unrecognizable from their pre-mashup form.
Thankfully, Gillis treats their reincarnation
with care: While it’s easy to lose sight of nu—
ances in a writhing mosh pit, it doesn’t take
a practiced D] to realize Gillis’ arrangements
are some of the most impeccably constructed

- Chris Neverman I Visual Editor
Gregg Gillis, the man under the moniker Girl Talk, uses his laptop as his instrument during a concert at Stage AE in Pittsburgh.

in the business.

Accordingly, despite the encyclopedic na-
ture of his sample catalog, there is such a thing
as a typical Girl Talk song: mainstream rap
vocals entangled with popular rock instru-
mentation — a highlight was the mashup of
Ludacris’ “Move Bitch” and Black Sabbath’s
“War Pigs.” It’s to this artist’s credit that for
the frantic, near-seamless hour—and-a-half
marathon, this formula never once seemed
at the end of its novelty.

If there is any complaint to be made about
Gillis’ performance, it’s that there was little, if
any, diversity in his music’s emotional palate:
with the possible exception of the poignant
“Imagine” remix, every moment from begin-
ning to end was intended to inspire ecstasy and
abandon. Naturally, this is what this species of
show — more akin to a club rave than a tradi-
tional concert —- is for, and nobody entered
Stage AE last Saturday expecting a reflective or
solemn experience ?alaYo—Yo Ma. Nonetheless,
as long as Gillis is on a mission to clash together
virtually all songs in pop music hi_story, it would
be a refreshing break to see him piece together
something a little weightier. ,

In the end, what Girl Talk is doing is both
avant-garde and unfailingly populist; he’s per-
haps the ultimate bridge between Pitchfork
and Top 40 radio. And at a time when musical
taste is increasingly polarizing, there’s nothing
more important than that. ’

Pitt alum
wins award
for fourth

book

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Despite being young —— just turning 39
— Pitt alumnus Terrance Hayes received
a National Book Award for poetry, suc;{
ceeding over four other poets.

. The National BookiAwards are a series
of prestigious literary prizes given to writ-
ers since 1950 in categories for fiction,
nonfiction, poetry and young people’s ﬁc-
tion. Hayes won with “Lighthouse,” his
fourth book of poetry.

His success has caused excitement in
the Pitt community, particularly the Eng-
lish department, and the Carnegie Mellon
community, where he works as a profes-
sor. .
“People in the writing program have,
been talking about it a lot,” said Pitt pro-
fessor Lynn Emanuel, who taught Hayes in
Pitt’s Master of Fine Arts program. ‘7We’re
all thrilled. It’s an honor to win the Book
Award. It’s an exceptional honor to win it
so young.”

Emanuel served on the panel of judges
for the same award four years previously,
so she understands the challenges of judg-
ing as well as winning.

“During deliberations, we talked about
the way it’s hard to givethe award to a
single volume of poetry when there are so-
many that contain a life’s work,” Emanuel
said. “For a single volume by a young writer
to win the award is extraordinary.

“I’m not sure what the impact will be for
Terrance, aside from the fact that he will
be very busy and get job offers and who
knows what. But I think it’s exceptional
that this happened to someone as young
as he is.”

Hayes earned his master’s degree in
writing from Pitt in 1987. He currently
teaches English at CMU and keeps busy
teaching workshops and classes to students
examining poetry in the public sphere.

He makes time to write on a daily basis
and always challenges himself in his writ-
ing, according to fellow professor James
Daniels. '

“In each book, he’s challenged him;
self and his readers with fresh, innovative
work,” Daniels said in an e-mail. “Stylisti—

Books as gifts can be tricky

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

The Dos and Don’ts of Books As Gifts

Books are excellent gifts. Nice but not ex-
pensive, thoughtful but not weirdly personal,
a good book is a giftthat someone can appreci-
ate without feeling guilty that you went to too
much trouble.

If you give someone the book that becomes
her favorite, you will have her gratitude forever
—— Kurt Vonnegut’s “Brealdast of Champi-
ons” was one of the best birthday gifts I ever
received. ,

But giving someone a book is not a risk-

free proposition — generally, the safest gifts .

are not usually the best or most memorable
gifts. Without further ado, here are the Dos
and Don’ts of doing your holiday shopping at
the bookstore this season.

DO give a book you read and liked: This
should go without saying, but don’t give some-
one a book you haven’t read,‘ no matter how
highly recommended or critically acclaimed
it was. Yes, giving a book you’re not familiar

’ with gives you some deniability if the recipi-
» ent doesn’t enjoy it, but honestly, it’s better to

own your tastes.

For me, one of the nicest things about get-
ting a book from someone is the prospect of
being able to discuss it with them after I’ve
ﬁnished reading it. When someone I respect
says, “I lovedthis book, I think you’ll really
enjoy it,” I feel ﬂattered, as if I’ve been deemed
“good enoug ” for a book that means a lot to
him or her.

DON’T give someone your favorite book
in the world: On the ﬂip side of this, not every,
book is for every person, and not every book
that changed your life is a book that everyone
positively must read, to have a fulﬁlled life.

Overwhelming love forabook or author can

blind you to otherwise obvious differences be—. -

tween your tastes in literature and your friends’,
which leads to ill-advised gifting choices. As in
most things, you won’t make good decisions if
you’re too emotionally invested.

Put yourselfto this test: if you would think
less of someone for telling you he didn’t like
“East of Eden,” do not, under any circumstanc-
es, give him “East of Eden” for Christmas.

_ DON’T give a book that’s commonly read
in high school: Unless you know of a not com-
pletely obvious way to ﬁnd out for sure that
somebody hasn’t read the book you plan on
buying for them, there’s always the risk that
they will already have read it.

Buying abook that’s assigned in the major-
ity ofhighschool English classes is a very good
way to needlessly increase that risk. Obviously,

— curriculum varies widely across high schools,

but use your judgment. I read “All The King’s
Men” in high school English, but I can still
gift it with some conﬁdence that the recipient
probably hasn’t read it. “The Great Gatsby” is
another matter. I

DO give a stand-alone book: When you buy
someone abook, you are asking them to make

. the commitment of time and energy necessary

to read it. That’s why books are tricky gifts and
lots of people don’t recommend them. A book
is only a good gift if the experience of reading
it was worth the time it took to read.

Buying someone the ﬁrst book in a series is
implicitly asking them to read the rest of the
series, and frankly, that just isn’t fair. People

V have busy lives. Many people have long read— _

ing lists already, and though they will gladly
bump the book you gave them to the top of
the list because they love you, they might be
less willing to prioritizethe whole “Sandman”
series, no matter how awesome it is."

On a related note, if you’re buying a book
for someone who’s incredibly busy, think short.
Even better — thinkabook of poems or short
stories. These are digestible and low pressure.
Your loved one can read a couple of poems a
day or one short story every night before bed,
and there’s no race to ﬁnish the book.

DON’T give a book with controversial con-

. tent: If you look at the list ofbooks most com-

monly banned from public school libraries, it
becomes apparent that very few books worth
reading are rated PG. I’m not telling you to
eliminate every book on that listfrom your

gift—giving repertoire, I’m just telling you to I

use your head. Most people over the age of
16 are cool with profanity and sexual content
within reason. A

It is not, however, safe to assume that ev-
eryone will appreciate Junot Diaz’s collouial
use of the N-word in “The Brief Wondrous

Life ‘of Oscar Wao,” or ﬁnd Chuck Palahniuk’s .

shock—rocking interesting and clever. It’s hard
to avoid drawing conclusions about someone
based on the books they cherish, and ifyou gift
“Lolita” to somebody who doesn’t know you
——. orVladimir Nabokov — very well, the con-

clusion might be less “Teddy enjoys beautiful -

prose and morally challenging subject matter,”
and more “Teddy enjoys child porn.”

D0 use what you know:'Thanks to Face-
book, it’s incredibly easy to ﬁnd out what
kinds of books somebody likes and use that
as a jumping-off point.

Did your friend love “Thevcatcher in the

Rye”? Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar,” written l

around the same time, is another great com-
ing-of-age story set in the 19505. Also, _I.D.
Salinger’s lesser-known novella “Franny and
Zooey” is thought by many —. myselfincluded
—- to be better than “Catcher” by far.

Know someone who’s a Virginia Woolffan?
They’ll love “The Hours,” Michael Cunning-

ham’s 1998 novel weaving allusions to “Mrs. A

Dalloway” with speculation about Woolf’s
life.

If someone you’re shopping for is wild
about “Hamlet,” try giving her “Rosencrantz
and Guildenstem Are Dead,” Tom Stoppard’s
tragic but hilarious absurdist play that follows
these two minor characters in Shakespeare’s
masterpiece. I

cally, he’s very inventive. Nobody out there
is writing like Terrance, and I think the
distinctiveness of his voice makes him
stand out. His work reaches across many
of the groups that make up contemporary
poetry.” V

Hayes said in an e-mail that he con-
sidered himself a reader long before he
became a writer and remembers reading
poetry along with fiction at a young age.
Though he never strongly considered mak-

ing a career out of poetry, now that he is ‘

a writer, he can’t imagine doing anything
else.

He also believes Pitt professors had a
large impact on his style.

“I remember my three poetry profes-
sors: Ed Ochester, Lynn Emanuel and Toi
Derricotte,” he said. “They were three
distinct poets and teachers. Each was en-
couraging and engaging. I try to be a poet
that combines all they taught me about
mind, body and spirit.”

Emanuel remembers Hayes in her
classes as a young man who was “finding
his voice.”

“He was sort of going back and forth
between writing about African-American
superheroes and his family,” she said. “If
you think in terms of his current devel-

oped work, it was a kind of interesting
sign of what would happen later.

“His poetry is in some ways rooted in
the real, domestic world of the family. In
other ways, it is also very socially con-
scious and very interested in both ste-
reotypes and characters from African-

even when he arrived.”

Although there are people who don’t
appreciate poetry or read it regularly,
Hayes considers the art small but thriv-

but you’ll also find regular people who
somehow discovered a poem or poet. I
think there’s something for everybody in
the form. No one says, ‘I don’t like music,’
because there are so many kinds of music.
The same is true of poetry.”

Emanuel also feels that poetry, one of
the oldest forms of literature, carries a

historical weight with it, making it a pow-'

erful class topic for all her students, past
and present. V

“It has an incredibly complex body of
knowledge attached to it,” she said. “I
think the other thing that an instructor
does is invite a student to enter this long,

complicated conversation by writing. I‘

think every_student in a MFA, certainly
any at Pitt, is very aware of some kind of
historical and cultural burden pressing
down on everything they write.”

With the award came a reassurance
for Hayes that people still care about the
art form. '

“Winning the National Book Award
only confirmed my belief that people
still care deeply about poems,” he said.
“I’ve heard from people across the social
spectrum who are curious or encouraging
about what I do. I’ve been excited and a bit
overwhelmed by all the attention.” I

FOOTBALL

Lewis has career day in Pitt win over Cincy

Win ends Big East season on a positive note, guarantees Panthers a winning season

~ Brody Engelhard
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Dion Lewis provided something Satur-
day against Cincinnati that the Panther
football team has been looking for all
year. A preseason All-American, Lewis
has struggled with injuries and has not
performed at the same level as last year,

(‘when he produced nearly 1,800 yards
on the ground.

Although Lewis had a considerably
disappointing 2010 campaign -— with
less than half of the yards he produced
a year before —— it didn’t stop him from
having a career day against the Bearcats

“to close out the regular season.

Lewis rushed for a career—high 261
yards while scoring four touchdowns at
the snow—covered Nippert Stadium as the

Panthers beat the Bearcats 28-10.

The win snaps a two-game skid against
the Bearcats — in the previous two years,
Pitt lost to Cincinnati with Big Easttitle
implications on the line.

L With Saturday’s win, Pitt earned part
of a three-way tie for the Big East Cham-
pionship. . g

It was only the third time this year
Lewis has gone for more than 100 yards,
and only the second time with multiple
touchdowns. Lewis has 2,755 career yards
and is now second among Pitt sophomore
running backs behind only LeSean Mc-
Coy, now of the Philadelphia Eagles.

“We got Dion [Lewis] rolling today.
We felt the conditions gave us reason to
lean that way because of the snow and
ice,” Pitt head coach Dave Wannstedt said
after the game. “He responded, and it
wasn’t easy, but it was great to see him

i Eamon Queeney I The News Record

Pitt running back Dion Lewis ran for a career-high 261 yards Saturday against Cincinnati while also scoring four touchdowns.

finish up the year with that type of per-
formance.” ‘

_ Fellow running back Ray Graham saw
limited minutes because of an injury and
only received one carry for 7 yards. Lewis
became more of a feature back with his
increased workload of 42 carries.

“I love Ray [Graham], and he was a
little banged up this week, but he was
anxious to go. We went into this game,
and we weren’t sure how much Ray was
going ‘to play, and I told Dion to get ready
for 35 carries,” Wannstedt said in a news
conference. “I think that sometimes when
a player goes into a game knowing that
there’s no turning back, and he knows
that he is the guy, sometimes you ap-
proach it a little differently.”

' ' Sports Staff

The Pitt men’s and women’s basketball teams
completed a successﬁ1l doubleheader at the
Petersen Events Center on Saturday, with both
teams recording blowout victories. The men’s
team remains undefeated, and the women look
to build off their strong performance heading
into Big East play.

Men’s Basketball

The No. 3 Panthers defeated Rider University '

(5-4, 1-1 MAAC) 87-68 behind senior Brad Wa-
namaker’s impressive 16-point, 11—assist effort to
go along with zero turnovers and ﬁve rebounds.

Wanamaker led the Panthers (9-0) in assists

its unselﬁshness. At halﬁime, Pitt had 14 assists

on 16 ﬁeld goals. The Panthers ﬁnished tied with ‘

a season-high 27 assists on 31 ﬁeld goals.

Rider head coach Tommy Dempsey said Pitt
does a nice job of playing off each other. _

“They continue to run their stuff, they don’t
settle,” he said aﬂzerthe game. “You have to contin-
ueto guard for20-25 seconds. Their shot selection
is very good, their pass selection is very good 
They nevermake your defensive possession easy
by throwing one pass-and launching a sho ”

Makingthe extrapasswas afocus atthe Pan-
thers’ practices this week, Wanamaker said.

“We were showingwhatwas preachedinprac—
tice,” he said after the game. “We’re ﬁnding the
open guys [and] they are hitting sho .”

The Panthers used two ﬁrst-halfruns to pull
away from Rider. Down 7-2 ﬁve minutes into the
game, Pitt took the 11-7 lead with athree-minute,
9-0 rim that included four points ﬁ'om Gilbert

The Broncs fought back, with Mike Ringgold
making a shot inside to cutthe score to 13-11, but
Pittansweredwithits secondrunofthehalf,a16-4
spurtthat stretched the lead to 29-15.

A Brandon Penn 3—pointer with 12.5 seconds
left trimmed Pitt’s leadto40-29, butDante Taylor
answered at the other end, hitting a layup with
three seconds left to send the Panthers into the
break with a42-29 advantage.

Ashton Gibbs followed withalong two.
Afterjustin Robinson answered with

The Bronc’s Robinson, who en-

er at 15.5 points per game, was held

scoreless in the ﬁrst half, going 0-8

The Panthers, who were without

due to suspension for violating team
rules, never missed a beat on Satur-

day. On ateamwithﬁve senior starters '

Football< 16

The ﬁrst quarter was capped
off with a Lewis touchdown from
two yards out, and the second
quarter started with a 76-yard
scoring run by Lewis.

It was never really close after
that. The Bearcats struggled to
contain the run, and Lewis made
them pay as the Panthers’ offense
racked up 430 yards of offense
for the day. Pitt won the time of
possession by 11 minutes, and
was 9-16 on third down.

Pitt quarterback Tino Sun-
seri was efficient despite the
unfriendly throwing conditions.
He completed 14-of-23 for 158

yards with no touchdowns and 0

one interception. It was his
counterpart, Cincinnati quarter-
back Zachicollaros, who really
struggled, throwing one touch-
down with three interceptions
going 12-of-24 for 109 yards.
“There is no secret. You win
football games by stopping the
run and getting off the ﬁeld on
defense. You can’t turn the foot-

ball over on offense,” Cincinnati 0

head coach Butch Jones said af-
ter the game. “Obviously, they
won the battle up-front and they
were able to run the football.”

Although Pitt pulled into the
three-way tie for the Big East
Championship alongside Con-
necticut and West Virginia, the
Panthers lost out on the Big
East BCS Bid because they lost
to both the Huskies and the
Mountaineers.

“But the bottom line, end of

getting revenge on Cincinnati,”
Wannstedt said. “It was really

coach Agnus Berenato said. “Shewasvery asser-
tive and aggressive. She was not afraid or timid
ortentalive at all.” _

At the end of the ﬁrst half, Pitt had already
forced 15 Mount St. Mary’s turnovers, the main
reason they held an 18-point lead going into the

- locker room. Many of their mmovers came as a
product of the full court press and the 1-2-2 trap
zone that Pitt ran early on. Pitt’s size advantage

“I think that’s what a team is all about,” Be-
