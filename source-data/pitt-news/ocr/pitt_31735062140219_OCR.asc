With Cage.

The second game of the series with
Geneva College played in the Gar-
dens last Friday evening, resulted in
another ‘victory for the Blue -and
Gold, the visitors going down to de-
feat by a score of 48 to 28. Only a
fair sized crowd was present to see
thegame and the spirit was not as
good as it might have been.- The
game was intensely interesting all the
way through, the Geneva ‘ﬁve doing
its best to win, ‘by fast and accurate

' shooting. -

The ﬁrst half ended with the score
35 to 10’ in our favor. Fa.rmer suc-
ceeded in throwing nine out of eleven
foul goals in the initial period, also
getting three ﬁeld goals in the same
Budd was in. splendid
spirits and put up the best game of
the season, getting four from the ﬁeld
in the opening half. . McDowell,
playing in Lindsay’s place, was able
to secure fo-ur ﬁeld goals and jumped
his -opponent in a creditable manner.

Farmer was slightly injured near
the closelof the game by a collision
with a portion of the cage, his pla.ce
being taken by Bane, who did excep-
tionally well.

Do You Want to Knock?

Here is Your Chance

Are you dissatisﬁed? Do you long
for a chance to wield the hammer?
Does your soul yearn for the oppor-
tunity to rap a part of this Univer-
sity? ‘

The Weekly is going to invite the
efforts of the students along this par-
ticular line of human prowess, by
calling the next issue a knockers’
number. Think of it! The arrival of
the time, when you may express your
pent up feelings with full effect!

The editors of the weekly have de-
cided that the most enjoyable Val-
entine Day number would be in the
form of a so—called knockers’ number.

The idea is to have the students,
members of the faculty and all those
connected with the University write
a knock about any phase of Uinversity
life. The invitation isiextended to all.
The range of subjects may cov-er any-
thing from the Chancellor to the jan-

how severe—it will be printed. There
are two restrictions——nothing of a.n in-
jurious character will be permitted to
run, and no personal indulgences will
be allowed. The idea is to have a- real
good-natured knocking contest. Get
your hammers ready.

Communications must not be over
‘two hundred words in length and to
insure publication -must absolutely
bear the signature of the writer, not
for appearance in the paper, but as a
guarantee of good faith.

Communications must ‘be handed in
to the J.14dl'E0I‘S not later than eleven
o’clock Saturday morning, February
11th. The proper place to leave your
knocks is in the Pitt Weekly mail
box in the general oﬂices, State Hall.

Now, everyone get your knocks
ready for the hammer issue next
week! '

  High School Stu-

dents Entertained

Event on March 3 Designed to
Promote Interest in the Uni-
versity By Engineering School.

The date for a reception to be given
‘to students of High Schools and pre-
;paratory schools, together with their
teachers and parents, has been set at
Mar-ch 3. This reception is to be
‘given in behalf of all departments of
‘the University. Light refreshments
'will be served, and it is very probable
that the regular work of the students
will ‘be carried on that evening as was
done so successfully lately at the time
.-of the inspection of the Engineering
building and equipment by the alumni,
though on this occasion students of
all departments will likely be on hand.

The interest of visitors, and partic-
ularly of those unfamiliar with the
operation of the University, is certain-
ly heightened by seeing the students
in action, and at such a time as this

, each stud.ent has an opportunity to

bring forth some of his school spirit
to the University.

Forensic Society Challenged by
Western lnstitution For De-

It is not unlikely that the debat-
ing team of the University will meet
the representatives of the University
of Notre Dame in an oratorical or
debating contest. The Notre Da.me so-.
ciety has challenged the University to
a debate and the members of the For-
ensic Society are considering the aid-
visalbility of accepting, at a date in
the near future. ' L

Such an arrangement, if it were A
possible to complete_ the necessary

details, would prove immensely inter-
esting to the lovers of the debate.

Chapel Attendance Poor‘ 

- Failure to Attend Devotional Ser-

vice is Noted in Dwindling
Class Representation.

A careful study of the attendance
at chapel exercises, during the past
month, reveals the fact that the stu-
dents have become very careless in
their attendance of devotional ser.-H
vices. Some mornings the space allot-
ed to one class is totally free from

the presence of its members. The Sen- >

iors, to their credit, seem to be the

best class in the University in regard -

to "chapel hours, the Juniors. the
poorest, and the Sophomores and the
Freshmen about even _in the way»-of
attendance. The matter of going to"
chapel is a purely personal choice and
cannot be altered by compulsion or;
any other means, but, it is only fair
to the man or woman, that.a. good
average attendance be kept up. The
speakers at the services recently have
been so good that none can afford to
miss the treat offered.

It would be follyito exhort the vir-
tue of compulsory chapel, because it
is primarily wong to force devotion
on any one, but the value of being
present three mornings in the week,
is almost self-evident to the thinking
person. 1

basketball ﬂoor at least. The last
game was closely contested, and of-
fers sufficient evidence that the

decided in our favor, as we already

it is absolutely imperative that the

Writer in Saturdav Evening Post
Cites University Professor as
Type of Real Learned
Man.

Henry Hyde, in the issue of the
Saturday Evening P‘ost for last week,

imentions Professor Robert Kennedy
Duncan as one of the foremost’ col-

lege professors, laboring toward busi-
ness efﬁciency, by the creation of in-
dustrial fellowships in the commercial
World. The article is quite compre-
hensive in character and is a worthy
tribute to the labors of Doctor Dun-
can. _ 

_ In the collegiate side of life, too
often, the practical is forgotten and
the writer in the periodical makes the
point, that Professor Duncan is one
of a type that sees the greater things
and is working for their perfection. —

Senate .iHoldsi Meeting

Chapel Attendance and Senate
Elections Are Discussed at

Meeting of Senators Last
Week. V

At a meeting of the combined Sen-
ates of the different schools held last
Friday, the only matters of general
interest discussed were the subjects
of chapel attendance and the mid-year
Senate elections.

The matter of chapel attendance
was approached not so mu-ch from a
religious point of View as from
a‘ consideration of the beneﬁts to be
derived from a regular and well at-
tended series of gatherings of the stu-
dents in the matter of fostering school
spirit and interest in’ school activities.
Chapel attendance is merely another
instance of the difference between
preaching and practice. If the abol-
ishment of chapel services were put
to a vote it is not likely that one-

of doing so. All that is needed to.
promote increased attendance is a
realization by the students that they
are missing something important by
staying away.

In regard to the Senate elections
it was d.ecided that the secretary send
notices to the presidents of the differ-
ent classes to call a meeting for the
purpose of electing senators at such
a time that the results would be
known in time for the newly elected
men to take ofﬁce at the next regular
meeting of the‘ combined Senates on
February 15. ' '

ENGINEERS TO MEET

Rumors of Another Banquet Pleases
The Engineers In University
—Meeting Today.

The general meeting of all the en-
gineering students which has {been an-

unavoidably postponed on each oc-
casion, will take place at the earliest
opportunity. The various matters of
interest to the engineering students
to be brought up at.this m-eetingeare
not deﬁnitely known as yet, but it is
!rumored that plans are in progress
ffor the arrangement of another ban-
Equet similar to the last one. At any
irate, such an. affair, after the congeni-
iality and enthusiasm evoked at the
{former one, should prove an even
ggreater success and be more largely
[attended than before.

Foot Ball Rules
Slightly Changed

Committee Believes in Letting
_Well Enough Alone and Code
Is Not Butchered. '

 

 

The Intercollegiate F.ootball Rules
Committee did a little surgery on the
game at a meeting in New York last
week. '

With E. K. Hall of Dartmouth as
‘chairman and _VValter Camp as secre-
tary the co-mmittee de-cided that inter-
missions were too long and reduced
the periods between the ﬁrst and
second and third and fourth quarters
from three minutes to_two minutes.
A new rule was adopted permitting
teams by agreement, to tra.nsfer the
supervision of offside play upon the
line of scrimmage from umpire to
head linesman. The linesman, how-
ever, is to report any infraction to the
umpire.

Another new rule adopted provides
that throwing a player to the ground
after the referee has declared the ball
dead may be considered unnecessary
roughness. An amendment was
adopted allowing only three men to
walk up and down the ﬁeld on each
side of the line. The present rule al-
lows ﬁve men. If the ball accidentally
strikes a.n ofﬁcial, provides another
amendment, it shall not become dead,
but play shall continue.

A new rule adopted speciﬁes that
all penalties under the rules regulat-
ing the forward pass shall be applied
from the spo-t of the down and not
on the spot from which the pass was
made. »

The committee transferred the duty

to the umpire, and in rule 18, section
‘2, which -provides that a player in
catching‘ for a pass shall not be
tackled or shouldered until he has
caught the ball and “taken more than
one step in any direction,” the words,
“taken more than one step in any di-
rection,” were sticking out.

After the conference Mr. Hall said:
“The reason that the committee made
so few changes is that we feel the
game has accomplished what the new
rules started out to do—the elimina-
tion of serious injuries——and that it
is now a safe and playable game.”

It was decided that if the ball, after
having been legally passed. forward
and having legally touched, shall then
_be fumbled and touch the ground, the
pass shall be considered as incom-
plete. The object of this rule is to
stop high passes and make a. clean
play.

A foul, following a ﬁrst or second

"down committed on or behind the

goal line by a player of -the side in
possession of the ball, while the ball
is behind the goal line or in flight

the goal line, shall be penalized by
the loss of a down and the ball shall
‘be put in play for the ensuing down
on the one-yard line. If such foul

follows a third down, the referee shall;

FORENSIC SOCIETY IN

‘Regular Meeting brings O_ut Large

Attendance of Members.

An interesting meeting of the Pitt
Forensic Society was held on Tues-
day evening, January 24th. A great
deal of business was transacted.
brought before
the Society for discussion was that of
considering an Intercollegiate debate
with the University of Notre Dame.
Notre Dame is apparently anxious to
arrange a debate with Pitt this year
and has made a good offer. No deﬁnite
action has been taken on the chal-
lenge thus far, however.

A call for candidates for the de-

nbating team was issued and an en-

couraging numberof applicants re-
sponded. -The ofﬁcial critic of the
Society was given the authority to
s,e1ect the teams which will represent

ithe University of Pittsburgh in the

contest with Allegheny and Wooster

FALSE JEWELS.

A few weeks ago a very rich wo-
man d.ied, leaving many precious
things and among the number was a
collection of rare jewels noted for
_  . their resplendency and value. P.articu-

,. jlarly conspicuous"was a luminous
necklace of pearls, whose worth was
alm-ostjncommensurable, according to
those in a position to know. Ex-
amination proved, however, after the
good woman had passed away, that
. the reputed, pearl necklace was large-
, ” ly sham, that many imitation stones
were among the number of the genu-
ine. No one had ever doubted the

7 man‘to wear stones of false value.
A , The world l.ooked at them with eyes
agape and said nothing. In college
life there are characters with the Same
 , traits as this woman of commanding
A ﬁnancial position. The men’m-ove

' among the affairs of student‘ life, are
possessed of the same emotions and
traits as those of the outer world.
It occurs, therefore, that the popular
man, the studious man or whomsoever
is ‘chosen, -falls heir to the same privi-
lege of wearing false jewels of charac-
ter. The opinion goes out, that such
 ' and such a man is a good fellow—he
is a good mixer, as the world goes,
and that is enough for many of us.
It never penetrates the mind, that the
man may be unﬁt for the real things
,_ of life. The question is seldom raised
. fwhether or not the pearls of his suc-
cess are genuine or not? Even the
man who is known to ‘be of unques-
tionable standing, the man whose sta-
 bility has beenhearned by effort and

display our inferior traits, but the best
way is to show false, where ‘there is
falsity, and be sincere, where there is
sincerity.

MOSTLY SQUABBLE.

The pressiof the country was agi-
tated last week by an article, credited
to the Daily Maroon, the ofﬁcial news-
paper of the University of Chicago.
The writer dilated at length on the

iodern aspects of impure athletics;
the almost passionate craving for vic-
tory, regardless of the cost and lastly,
the terriﬁc competition of the colleges
and universities to secure isuitajble
athletic material for their various
teams. ‘The newspapers, gave a great
deal of prominence to the utterance
of the Chicago student———they general-
ly do exploit the freak professors and
other things, coming from Chicago,
pretty well in the public prints. A
very careful analysis of the situation,
reveals the fact, that the entire mat-

THE PITT WEEKLY

clean up a'nd eliminate the unsavory
from their athletic records. ,MOSt as-
suredly athletics are getting better,
bigger and stronger and no amount of
disparagement from sources similar to
the article of last week will alter the
situation.

 

REMEDY IS NEEDED.

Last Saturday the newspaper dis-
patches contained a report of a
hockey game played in Cleveland,
Ohio, with Western Reserve Univers-
ity andthe name of the opponeents
of the Ohio seven was no other than
the University of Pittsburgh. The
Weekly does not know who the lead-
/ers of the team are, ‘but they are stu-
dents in the institution, who lack that
rare human quality, commonly known
as common sense. It has been wide-
ly advertised that the University
would not be represented by a hockey
team this winter-. Now comes those
irrepressible men, who will not abide
by any decision of the athletic au-
thorities and the general public raises
its eyebrows with a questioning look,
that does ‘not augur well for the in-
stitution. Last week a certain class
team in the University was the cause
of a" censure from a nearby high

school, because of a slight irregular-

ity in the lineup used’ against the
home team. Naturally the school an-
thorities resented the lack of courtesy
displayed in the condu-ct of the game
and immediately notiﬁed the Univers-
ity concerning the breach of collegiate
etiquette. A few weeks ago notices
appeared in thepress of the city, that
the University of Pittsburgh Inde-
pendents would form the University
strength in baseball this coming
spring,“ and at the time the Weekly
urged the athletic committee to in-
vestigate the formation of such an
organization and stamp it out at once.
Now these two latest slurs on the
integrity of the University are per-
petrated. FOR ONCE AND FOR
ALL, THE WEEKLY WISHES TO
STATE EMPHATICALLY THAT,

ter resolves itself into mere news-
paper prattle, with a ranting college‘;
student responsible for the racket.i
Calamitylhowlers were present in all:
ages and will continue to be until the I
no_tes of one Gabriel will reverberate

through the atmosphere. It is true,

the spirit of victory_iS in the ascend—§
ency, it is not disputed that collegesii
and universities have infringed upon?
the strict ethics of goodjbeh.avior——§
there is nothing new or startling in:
the phrases, everyone is familiar with
the facts. This acrobatic manipulator
of language did not give us any ad-
ditional facts of philosophy or grasp of;
the real athletic situation in the
American colleges. Quite the con-
trary from the‘rabid remarks of the
notoriety seeker, is the true aspect
of the case. Athletics in this country
are growing stronger, more virulent!
every year, because the students ofl
the American institutions want their:
sport based on the true concepts of}:
success. The large colleges and uni-

versities in the East effectively dis-

prove the allegations of the Maroon

editor by their ‘continued efforts to

THE UNIVERSITY or PITTS-
BURGH IS NOT THE PROPERTY
OF ANY SMALL SET OF INDI-
VIDUALS AND ITS ATHLETIC
REPUTATION MUST NOT BE
SUBJECTED TO ANY FURTHER
INDIGNITIES AT THE HANDS
or IRRESPONSIBLE PERSONS.

This whole matter leads to one con-

clusion, that the University must have

a remedy for the extreme laxity prac-
ticed by the students and that as-
sistance can come from no other place
than a director of athletics with at -
solute and complete supervision of
all forms of sport. No discredit is

iintended for the present graduate

manager of athletics. Mr. Hurst is a
hard working man, with personal du-

ties constantly crowding for attention‘

and it is not to be wondered! that
many of the remote corners are over-
looked. The management of football
alone, is sufficient labor for Mr.
H-Tirst; it is almost a superhuman task
to arrange all the‘ details of a season’s
-schedule, yet the manager is forced.

itoloversee all other branches of the

work. -The demand for a man whose

ler.

 

sole duty will be the proper attention
of all athletics from the Varsity down
to the Freshmen teams, is present
now and should be satisﬁed, before
further harm is wrought to the name
of the University of Pittsburgh.

 

STUDENTS WRONGED

In a recent number of the Weekly
the manager of the musical clubs was

requested to make a statement con- _

cerning ‘the absolute failure of the
Christmas trip promised the students
at ‘the beginning of the present col-
lege year.
and the explanation has not’ "been
offered the students of the University.
Laying aside the absurdity of boyish
exuberance exhibited by ‘the leader Of
the musical clubs at the start of the
year, it is not without proﬁt to look
at the great harm the action has
wrought to the institution at large.
The student activities of the Univers-
ity should be in keeping with the mag-
niﬁcent strides being made by the
administrative authorities, which
means they should be the very best
and be founded upon s‘trict ‘business
policy. The glee club of Pittsburgh

should stand on a plane with the most.
capable in the country, ‘because it rep- ,

resents what is shortly to be a factor
in the educational strength of the
United States. Probably it never oc-
cured to Mr. Cunningham that he was
representing -a University and not a
small college in an obscure rural re-
treat. The people of this community
are looking to the University now and
saying where is your student organ-
ization; where is your glee club; we

know of your football team, but what '

of the rest? The affair given on
Thanksgiving evening was a start in
the right direction and the efforts of
the manager are entitled to great
credit, but, ‘the aftermath is such that
one is almost disgusted to even think
of it. Failure from the world go. Is
that adding anything to the prestige
we need so badly? The answer is self
evident. The lesson of this affair is

equally as prominent—-the manage-V

ment of 'ihe musical clubs must from

this time on, be placed under direct l a

faculty supervision or else arranged
in such a manner that the students
will not be subject to further mis-
representation. The Weekly, if fully
aware of the circumstances, which de-
pnived the Universi'ty of Pittsburgh
students of a Christmas trip; the
occurence is not a new one in history,
but in a spirit of perfect justice, no
mention will be made of personalities.
We, therefore, will deviate somewhat
from the suggestion we made in the
recent ‘issue and ask that Mr. Cunning-
ham apologize to «the Students of the
University of Pittsburgh.

Junior Prom is
I Progressing

All Indications Point to Success-

ful and Enjoyable Affair Next
Week.

The Promcommittee now has all
arrangements made for this. “great-
est social event of the year,” which
is to take place at the Rittenihouse
on February 17. Everything seems
to indicaﬁe that this year's. 7'Prom
will surpass all others, as it should
do to be consis.tent with the strides
the University itself is making. The
Juniors have done commend-able
work in sending outinvitations and
booming the affair among their
friends, both in and out of school,
and certainly deserve the success and
commendation coming to them.

The Prom is now so near at hand
that by this time nearly every s.tu-
dent will know whether 04- not he is
going; the few, however, who are
still unidlecided, should be reminded
that the arranging of the Prom is one
of the greatest of. the school activi-
ties, and that those who go not only
have a delightful time personally,
but at the same time help to make
more successful one of the most con-

spicuous. of the traditional school in-

stistutions.

THE PITT WEEKLY

Large Crowd
  a At Luncheon

Alumni Luncheon Yesterday
Was Most Enjoyable. Gradu-
ates Turn Out to Weekly
Affair.

Yesterday the regular weekly lunch-
eon ‘of the University Alumni took
place at the Fort Pitt Hotel. These
regular events are very instrumental
in keeping up and indeed strengthen-

ing the interest of the alumni in the

school. As was mentioned in last
week’s issue, the students are welcome
at these lunches, though owing to. the
demands of the schedule it is not like-
ly that many will be enabled to take
advantage of this opportunity of be-
coming acquainted with the alumni.

A plan has ‘been mentioned, how-
ever, whereby the students could take
advantage of these affairs. This con-
sists in having the luncheon for one
time at least, held at the University
Club, the location of which is, of
course, much more convenient. Should
the students show general interest in
this scheme there is no doubt that
arrangements could. be made to carry
it out. Tuesday, by the way, and not
VVednesday, as mentioned last week,
is the regular day for these lunch-
eons.‘

CHESS AND CHECKER CLUB
MEETS '

Jolly Time Experienced by Those In-

. The chess and checker club o-f the
University met_last Wednesday._even-
ing, about a‘ dozen being present, and
several departments being represented.
The evening was purely a social one,
no ofﬁcers being elected. Interest
in the club is continually growing, and
until the membership arrives at a
proper number no permanent organ-
ization will be effected. The‘ attend-
ance was well divided among the
classes and a very enjoyable time was
experienced by all.

Writes Article

Treatise on Camphor Appears
in Current Number of Har-
per’s Magazine.

In the February issue of Harper’s
Monthly appea.rs an article by Doctor
Duncan in which he ﬁrst states in a
general way that the advantages to be
obtained by taking over Eastern
knowledge into Western «civilization
are just as decided as the pecuniary
advantages derived from forcing west-
ern products into the east, and then
goes on to take up camphor as his
particular example.

This has always been an eastern
product, the principal natural source
being Formosa, and moreover, until
lately, its process of distillation and
preparation has been an exceedingly
wasteful one. Modern and non-waste-
ful methods of production only ar-
rived in Japan at the close of the Rus-
so-Japanese war, the business ‘being
made a‘ government monopoly for the
purpose of providing income to clear
up the war debt. Just when the Jap-
anese were beginning to effect a real
monopoly the synthesis ‘of camphor
was accomplished, first in a labora-
tory and then ‘commercially, and
moreover, it was discovered that the
tree from which camphor is extracted
could be cultivated commercially in
other parts of the world besides Ja-
pan, Just how these things were ac-
complished is told very entertaining-
ly and instructively in Doctor Dun-
can’s article. . .

PROMINENT MEN MAKE AD-

Chapel Lectures Prove of Interest

During Past Month.
In the course of the past few
weeks vmany prominent speakers

have given lectures before the stu-
dent body. It is hardly necessary to
refer to the self—evident interest in
and appreciation for such lectpres as
-those of Mr. George, Mr. Robbins
and Mr. Burns. .
This past week two other »-noted
men have been added to, the list in
the persons of Mr. Sheldon, of Chi-
cago, and Mr. G. W. Gerwig, the
local educator and supervisor of the
census, for this district. The lectures
by these men wereigreatly enijoyed
and brought home truths of great
signiﬁcance in student welfare.

Student Danced I
if ' . ls Successful

Large-Crowd Enjoys Hospitality
Of Seniors Saturday Evening
In Thaw Hall.

The ﬁrst of,a series of dances to be
given this year under the auspices of
the Student Senates was held Satur-
day evening in the assembly room in
Thaw Hall. From the manner in which
the students turned out, it is evi-
dent that these dances will prove just
as successful as those of last year in
promoting congeniality among the
students and causing a good time gen-
erally. A

The affair was absolutely informal,
and, in spite of the fact that it could
not be carried over ‘into the “wee sma’
hours” after the manner of the aver-
age dan-ce, it was very -enjoyable. The
committee in charge arranged things
very well, and the only criticism com-
ing to the Senators is that this affair
should not have been the ﬁrst. How-
ever, it will probably be fa'r from the

and return Sunday. The strength of
Hiram is not known, but it is said the
Akron ﬁve is one of the cleverest
teams in the Buckeye State. Pitt
should have little difficulty in holding
her ‘own as the recent work of the
team shows itito be very high class.

THE Pirr WEEKLY

 

* Cap; and Gown

Club Meets

Arrangements For Play Being
Completed—-Associate Alumni

I 1 Memberships Being Created as

Incentive to Financial Success.

 

The Cap and Gown Club of the Uni-
versity met last ‘Wednesday evening
to outline plans for the play to be
given this year and to discuss gener-
ally ways and means to perfect the
organization of the club and promote
enthusiastic support of the student

. body.

Mr. Birdsall, the note-d dra'matic
critic, has assumed the directorship of
the club. Mr. Birdsall has studied un-
der Belasco, and his wide experience,
coupled with the zealous efforts of the
club members themselves, cannot help
but insure pronounced success for the
performance this year.

Th=e scheme outlined for this year is
a modest one, as is ﬁtting at this stage
of the organization's development. It
is probable that after all there will be
no attempt made to produce an ori-
ginal comedy, it being likely that a
play will be sent for though this is
not deﬁnite as yet. For téheypresent it
is planned ‘to have the performance
in two parts, a‘ one act comedy being
given as a curtain raiser and the sec-
ond part !being devoted to a collection
of musical numbers after the manner
of a musical revue. ‘Many original
numbers composed by the members
or by others of the student body will
be given. ' I

The club -this year has a" more ex-
tended and enthusiastic mem'bers'hip
than ever. The nucleus of the organ-
ization was originally in the Dental
School; the membership has now
spread until practically all depart-
ments are represented, the -College in

‘particular, making a prominent show-

ing. The members, however, are not

 satisfied, gbeing ambitions for a still

further extension, and it is earnestly
desired that more candidates come out
for the club. ’ '

The plan of having associate stu-
dent memberships has

lege is now being extended to the
Alumni. Such a scheme, when it at-
tains its full development, insures a
sound ﬁnancial basis for the organi-
zation, giving.1t more stabilityiand
guaranteeing its continuance and
growth.

Reception and Dance

Will ‘Entertain Fellow Students
and Friends on Friday Evening,
February Twenty-fourth, at

Fri-en-ds of the Evening Sc-hool will
be glad to hear the ‘association
planning for them an informal dance
and reception for Friday evening, the
twenty-fourth of February, at Monte-
ﬁore Auditorium. The executive com-
mittee intirnatethat this will eclipse
all previous Evening School affairs
and that a great surprise is in store
for all who attend. The program is a‘
very elaborate one and provides for
the entertainment of all so that there
will not be a dull. moment for anyone
the entire evening. McNer_nry’s or-
chestra has been engaged to furnish
the music and a buffet luncheon will
be served.

The Evening School
has smoked and’ eaten together often,

Association

but this is the grst time they have

extended a general invitation to their
friends and fellow students to parti-
cipate in their social functions. In this
instance they hope to achieve “two
results. First. Secure a more intimate
acquaintance with the Day School
students, whose fellowship and good
will mean much to them, despite the
fact that they. are in attendance at
the University but a few hours a week.
All day school students should at-
tend so far as possible. Second. To
induce those friends not affiliated
with the University to identify them-
selves with som-e one of its depart-
ments. Its opportunities along this

line are particularly great in view of '

the fact that each student has many
friends who are in need of such an
education as the Evening School af-
fords. Therefore. Get Busy.

Tickets may be secured at the Uni-
versity ofﬁce from F. H. Eckles.

ECONOMICS STUDENTS I
PLAN BANQUET

School of Economics to be Discussed
in Series of University
Departments.

Students in the School of Eco-
nomics sare arranging for a banquet
of all classes to be held some time
next month. An affair of this sort
would serve probably bet.ter than
anything else in gg-tting the mem-
bers of the school acquainted and
promoting Congeniality among them.

The School of Economics is the
next in the series to be taken up in
the Weekly. Its operation, growth
and future prospects will be dis-
cussed in somewhat the same manner
as that in which other schools have
been written up in previous issues of

The University of ‘Pittsburgh offers instruction in eleven thoroughly
organized schools. ‘ '

The courses in the School of Liberal Arts are organized according to
the group system which provides broad general culture as well as the oppor-
tunity for specialization in the latter part of the course.

A full college course for the training of teachers is oﬁered in the
School of Education. Educational theory based on the newest conceptions
of science, and professional skill developed by unusual facilities at the com-
mand of the University-serve as the basis of this course.

manufacturing plants is now in -operation in the School of Engineering.

New buildings in the new location in Oakland are now occupied by the V
College School of Education, School of Economics, School of Engineering.
