ODK Walk

BY DAVE WINTER
Two Wilde men have left their
marks on the Pitt campus.

Don Wilde, the "outstanding se-
nior student” this year, is the se-
cond half of one of the finest brot-
her acts ever seen at Pitt. ’

Both Don and his brother Gus
(College '43) have their names en-
graved on ODK Walk and the simi-
larity between their lives is amaz-
mg.

Both men were bequethed a jut-
ting Wilde jaw (pronounced Will-
dee) and both attended South High
School.

Gus was a guard on the football
and basketball team. He barely‘
missed being on South’s state
championship basketball team in
1937. He was only a green sopho-
more then, but went on to become a
varsity regular in both sports.

In his spare time he was ptesi-'
dent of the school's student coun-
cil.

fraternity, president of Druids, acti-

sident of the Student Faculty
Association (forerunner of Student
Congress) and in his senior year
was captain and coach of the swim
team.

After graduation, Gus took mid- .l
shipman training at Northwestern A
and then went to PT boat school.
He was a torpedo boat skipper in
the South Pacific in the last
months of the war.

OHIO STATE’S May Week, annual
Spring celebration, was marked by
a series of raids on women’s dormi-
‘tories ’--and sorority houses in the
_ dead of‘ night, according to the Ohio
. ;State Lantern.

A Starting about 11:30 p.m., May 2,

pulled down fire escapes and entered
. through the dormitory windows.Once
’ inside, they attempted to throw some
frof the residents into showers.

Wyhen campus police arrived with
[tear gas bombs, the radiers tear-
frilly left the first dorm invaded
[and .went on to two more. Here,
some, of the enraged girls were
successful in throwing some of the

marauders under showers before
they got away. _
The next night, approximately

100 boys again broke in through
‘women’s dormitory windows. When
campus and city police arrived,
they. moved on to two sorority
houses where they repeated their
* "antics. .

Five men‘ who were allegedly
‘among theraiding parties were sus-
, pended’ pending a decision by the
*“OSU Student Court. Six women who
“ iwfere accused of assisting the
raiders to enter the raided build-
""ngs’ were also suspended.

Letters to ytheliclitor

the University. This matter was
made public by your office in order
that the students would be aware
of this understanding with the City.
I am attaching hereto a copy of a
recent publication, apparently from
the “Pitt News, criticizing the City
for deeming baseball more impor-
tant than college. I assure you we
have enjoyedthe cooperation of
working with «you and your asso-.
ciates, but feel that such criti-
cism is unjust and that it should

be somewhat controlled.
Donald M. McNeil
Traffic Engineer
City of Pittsburgh

(Mr. McNeil refers, to an agree-
ment’ ‘made between the City and
University in 1947 whereby
Schenley Plaza parking spaces
were relocated and lifted to pro-
vide morercar space. Below is a
copy of the letter confirming this
agreement, written in 1947 by
William. McElwain, then an assist-
anlto the dean of men. - Ed.)

Mr. Donald'McNeil .
Bureau of Traffic Planning

Following our discussion last
week I am setting down in writing
the points covered in that discus-
sion, as you requested.

First; the Universityis complete-
ly satisfied with the technical as-
pects of the parking arrangement
for the Schenley Park Plaza, as
drawn up by your office. I-low park-
ing under that plan might be super-
vised is the only point in question.

You have suggested that the

University pay the salaries of two
police officers to supervise park-
mg in the area from 8:00 a.m. to

1:00 p.m. each day throughout the
school year. You have pointed out
that neither the park nor traffic
police have sufficient personnel to
handle that area as a part of their
normal duties, and you add that
considerable expense is involved
in what you con-sider chiefly a

' University problem.

Appreciating your point of view,
we wish you to consider these per-
tinent factors: a.

(1) Many people not connected
with the University park in that
area, including staff and visitors
to Carnegie Library and Museum,
employees of certain Oakland busi-
ness houses, etc.

(2) Pitt students and faculty are
citizens of Pittsburgh and entitled
to park on a public street, as are
any other citizens of the city.

(3)’,The expense involved is, as
suggested by you, considerable
and one which we cannot bear at
this time.

With these

considerations in

mind, we do not feel justified in

assuming the sole responsibility
for the parking problem in that
area. We do feel that your plan
should. be carried out, because

parking in the Plaza at present is
somewhat a haphazard affair, ex-
tremely wasteful of available
space. Since our students and
faculty ‘do comprise a large share

..of those parking in the Plaza, we
"make this offer:

To pay one police officer (or
two, if it proves necessary) to
supervise parking in the Plaza

from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. each
school day for three weeks, in the
belief that this well be sufficient
time to get people into the habit
of parking correctly. They now
park in a semi-consistent pattern,
even though there are no lines to
guide them.

We further would publicize
through our student publications
the new system of parking and,
would make it plain to students
and faculty that on the days of
home baseball games, they must
have their cars out of the Plaza by
-12:30 or run the risk of being hem-
med in when the city police begin
parking the ball game crowd solid-
ly.

We also would make it clear that
we do not condone illegal parking,
that we expect the city to tag any
cars parked illegally, and that we
thoroughly approve of such police
action.

I hope that, on this basis, you
and other city authorities will see
fit to go ahead with the relining of
the Plaza area, according to your
proposed plan. .

NEAT DODGE DEPT.: A journa-:

lie accepted it on grounds that
it involved communicating from this
world to another.

While on- the subject of journa-

disgusted with his class and cried
out: “Whaddya come to school for

WHO CAN WE TRUST DEPT.’
Leafing through old files of The
Pitt Summer News, I see where the
English department’s Donald Lee
says, in effect, that Webster’s Dic-
tionary is notto be trusted.

Mr. Lee, an ex-staffer of Webs-
ter’s, says the help does not have
time to check conclusively into the
definitioniof words. ,

With our faith in Webster’s de-
stroyed, what are we to go by? A
guy can say that coat means celery
or that desk means union suit, and
who’s to dispute the matter. _

PLEASANT PASTIMES DEPTJ
The big brains of the fraternities
become more ingenious by the day.
Only this month a Youngstown Col-’
lege frat initiated eight pledges by’
setting them adrift in a small boat
in the middle of Lake Erie for six
hours.

On the same night two fraternity
pledges of Wittenberg College. were
blindfolded on a highway and left
to stumble back to town as best”
they might. A truck bowled them
over, killing one and breaking the
other’s arm.

In the last analysis, the only
thing dumber than a frat man dish-
ing out “hazing” exercises is a
pledge taking them.

A After Graduation -. ?

Fifth of a Series

By DAVE WINTER

Talk about lucky people.

Most Graduates from the Pitt Schools of hlursing and Social
Work should bd ableito pick and choose when they go job-hunting.
There is a great shortage of personnel in both fields.

These two prpfessions used
the Pitt nursing school will" accept
men for the first time in history in
1950, and one-third of the students
in the social work school-are men.

Don’t snicker at the idea of male

. nurses. Mrs. Ruth P. Kuehn, dean

of the school, says, "The shortage
"makes nursing a good field for men.
There are many opportunities in
small hospital administration, in-
dustry, the Veterans Administra-
tion program and at state mental

0 hospitals which might attract men,

particularly if they had experience
as medical corpsmen in the service.

Bills Create Jobs

Federal legislation is making
both shortages more acute by pro-
viding money for hospital construc-
tion and for prevention and cure of
mental illnesses.

It is strange that these two pro-
fessions don’t attract more students,
because beginning salaries are high,
particularly for nurses.

The scarcity of nurses is most
acute in the public health field,
yet the American Health Association
wage floor is set at $3600 a year.
The Veterans Administration isn’t
stingy with its nurses, either. Its
scale rangesfrom a$3800 minumum
to a $7400 maximum.

The U.S. Army also needs nurses.
Besides bars on their shoulders,

I 0 they can get from $2160 to $5280

plus allowances for maintenance.

Nursing graduates from Pitt go
up the financial ladder faster be-
cause Pitt is one of 40 schools in
the US. which give courses lead-
ing to a bachelor’s degree as part
of the training.

Nurses Get Bachelors

Few nursing schools give bache-
lor’s degrees, but every year about
10 per cent of the nurses get bache-
lors. This is only a small part of
the reason behind the shortage,
though.

Dean Kuehn explains,“The Ameri-
can health program is developing
ahead of the nursing program. Group
hospitalization plans, for instance,
are increasing the use of available
hospital beds, and Pennsylvania
alone is building several hundred
hospitals.”

Hygiene Director Gets

State Medical Post

Dr. T. Lyle Hazlett, director of
the department of industrial hygiene
at the Medical School for 15 years,
has been named to a $9,000 a year
state position.

Governor Duff made the appoint-
ment, naming Dr. Hazlett as a mem-
her of a final non-court agency of
appeal on medical issues

to be strictly women’s jobs. But

Nurses’ Home
Projected

Pitt's building expansion program
has given top priority to the construc-
tionofan eleven story nurse’s home.
The building will be located in the
rear of the Falk Clinic facing the
Children’s Hospital.

Plans have already been completed
for its construction, but as yet es-

timations have not been made of its
cost.

Before construction can actually
get underway, several buildings, in-
cluding the Child Guidance Clinic,
will have to be torn down early this
summer to make way for the structure.

The city has already extended the
water mains in that area to meet the
expected increase in water consump-
tion. The building is scheduled for
completion in about two years.

The‘ University is building the
home in cooperation with the sur-

 

rounding hospitals, which initiated
the Dlan in 1938.

At that time the hospitals solicited
about $1,500,000 for the nurse’s
home , but that was not enough. The
remainder of the sum will be taken
from the building fund campaign
funds.

When the building is completed,
it willhouse 650 student nurses from
the University and the surrounding
hospitals.

The architects of the building are
Ingram, Boyd, and Pratt.

The undergraduate majoring in
the social sciences is not trained
for any specific job. Faced with
low wages or even no wages un-
less he takes advanced study, he
might think seriously about taking
a master’s degree in social work.
Rapid advancement, decent pay,
in most places satisfaction of
helping people . . .

Many graduates are stepping
right into supervisory positions on
account of the shortage,particularly
in group work. .

According to Helen Green, as-
sociate professor and public relat-
ions director for the school here,
social work is divided into three
main divisions: (1) individual and
family work, mending broken homes,
helping out in illness or economic
distress; (2) group work — settle-
ments, youth groups, etc.; (3) com-
munity work, which amounts to
social planning.

According to “Your Career”
(Simon and Schuster 1947, avail-
able in 825 C1.) beginners average
$2700 to $4000 a year and top-level
executives may get $5000-‘$15,000
annually.

Information is available in the
dean’s office, 2401 Cl., aboutjobs
after graduation and, for the under-
graduate, about entrance require-
ments and scholarships.

7th Floor Has
Art Exhibit

An exhibition of contemporary
American drawings is now on dis-
play in the fine arts gallery on the
seventh floor of the Cathedral.
They are drawings from the 1949
Whitney Annual exhibition.

These drawings are by thirty-
three different artists, some of
whom are John Sloan, Eugene
Speicher, Joe Jones, Reginald

Marsh, Ben Shahn, Saul Steinberg,
and Jacques Lipchitz.

The exhibition is circulated by
the American Federation of Arts

   
     

and will continue through May 30.

Football Coach Len Casanova

of his first team in Saturday’s in-
tra-squad \game, when the first-
string Blue team swamped the se-
cond, third Gold team, 54-6‘, before
over a 1,000 spectators.

But the head coach said that he
was "disappointed” with the show-
ing of his reserves. At this point
in the present grid campaign it
appears that depth will play a domi-
nant factor ‘in Pitt football for-
tunes next season.

Backfield Coach Jack Roche, the
winning coach along with End
Coach Bob Timmons, said that

State Big Obstacle

Penn State presents the biggest
obstacle to such achievement. Last
year the Lions shut out Pitt twice,
9-0 and 5-0.

But because of Pitt’s power at
the plate, the outcome this year
may be different. Six regulars, led
.by Centerfielder George Lowe with‘
.481, are batting .300 or better.

Lowe and Rightfielder Pat Murphy,
both_ converted first basemen, edged
regular outfielders for outer garden
jobs because of_ their stickwork.
Meanwhile, Bill Marhefka,
handed first sacker, is hitting .385.

W&J Easy

Along with this trio of first base-
men, Leftfielder Bobby Lewis,
utility man Sam Shapiro, and Third
Baseman Joe Ross give the Pan-
thers batting strength that has won
eight games.

With this hitting and the pitching
of Larry Brent and Rudy Hudec, who
are having their best year, a new
Pitt record may be established.’

The Panthers should take W85]
and Allegheny as they did last year.
Pitt beat the Presidents in two

they would ‘not block my vision by

B)’ WILL DOERGE

“Some people may say that I
was foolish to give up a high school
coaching post to go back to school,
but I believe that in the long run,
it was the best thing for me to do.”

That’s the way Ray Nedwidek,
the ex-Brookville high football
coach now attending Pitt, feels.
This February the 26 year old
Nedwidek resigned,his apparently
secure high school job to come to
Pitt to study for his masters degree
in physical education.

Nedwidek served two years as

his team to the class B Jefferson

year in 1948.

‘No Pressure’

‘'1 regretted leaving Brookville
because ‘everyone there was swell
to me,” he says. "There was no
pressure on me and it was a nice
place to work, but I’m looking to
the future.”

The former West View high ath-
lete was a popular coach at Brook-
ville. He left there with the recom-
mendation that "his work was ex-
cellent . ._ . he can coach in any
high school.” ‘

“Sure, I want to coach again,”
Nedwidek declafes. “I’d like to
get a job around here, .preferably a
WPIAL post.”

Had Baseball Offer

At Brookville, in addition to his
football chores, Ray taught physi-
cal education and handled baseball
and junior high basketball.

Nedwidek stays in touch with the
teaching profession by doing sub-
stitute teaching at his alma mater,
West View, in his spare time.

When Ray graduated in I942 from

Pitt and Carnegie Tech sporting
events, known for their bitterness,
will probably seem tame tomorrow
for the Panther netters after last
Saturday’s match with Western
Reserve.

. Pitt held a 4-1 lead at the end
of the first five events when it
began to rain. After the shower
was over, the Redcats said the
courts were too wet and refused
to continue. According to the Pan-
thers, there was nothing wrong with

" the courts and they claimed a vic-
tory by default.

West Virginia also fell to the
Pitts on Friday, 6-3, bringing the
‘Panther season record to 3-2.

Pitt is expected to win tomorrow
against the Tartans who have
played around the .500 mark against
minor foes. .

Who says a batter can’t steal
first bas e? Shortstop Dale Hamilton
of the Delta Sigma Delta’s did
exactly that last Friday at Ells-
worth as he sparked his team to a
9-6 victory over the Med Freshmen.

Hamilton showed a daring dis-
play of bunting which was remini-
,scent of past baseball greats. Only
‘one of his four hits went past the
infield. The speedy shortstop beat
out two bunts to the pitcher and a
bounder to third.

The Delta Sigs' left fielder,
George Barankovich, continued to
show why he is one of the most
feared hitters in the IM leagues.
Acrobatic George walked twice,
singled and homered

OPEN SEASON-Spring Festival’s publicity committee exhibits this
shot as an example of the wide fame of Friday’s Make-Believe Ball, fol-
lowing the release of several balloons last week bearing free tickets to
all Spring Festival events. The unidentified Ozark mountaineer thought
he had bagged one of them flying saucer critters, but wound up with a
vtatteredballoon and a jackpot ofadmissions to the week’ s Festival events.

 

Two_Down,
Six to G0

The first of the eight helium-
filled balloons released from the
Cathedral lawn to advertise
Spring Festival came to rest far
out in eastern Pennsylvania 4*
Saturday morning on the farm of
John Bodnar, of RJ). 1 Nesco-

-.ck, Pa.

Mr. Bodnar phoned publicity
chairman Michael. Marlowe at
noon Saturday and was informed
‘that the letter attached to the
balloon entitled him to free ad-
mission to all of the week's Fes-
tival events. Mr. Bodnar, how-
ever, .didn’t feel he’ could get
away from his fann chores to
travel here. He'll hang on to his -
Make-Believe Ball ticket for
Friday night's main ball and
make believe that he and his
wife are dancing to the music of
Ray Anthony’s orchestra at
West View Danceland.

A rather dubious communique
and picture released by the pub-
licity committee stated that an
Ozark mountaineer had brought
down another of the balloons and
would arrive in time for the ball
Friday night.
