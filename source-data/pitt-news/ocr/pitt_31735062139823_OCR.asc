Lounge To Open In Fall

Featuring the sessions of the
Univei-.~:ity Assembly Tuesday-
night was the report of Leslie
VVilkins on the High School In-
tcrscliolastics prograin here dur-
ing Spring Festival week.

Vv'ilkiiis predicted ‘that 8,0010
students from surrounding _Sf‘-h0(;5
would attend the InterscliolaSt1<-S, U9
complete program of which he out-
lined.

After the Cafeteria" committee un-
der Henry Ha,11er, C36, had reported
that there is little chance for iiii.pi'ov-
ing campus eating conditions, and
that the chief difficulty with the Uni-
versity cs-ifeteria is its location, the

Assembly authorized the g1'011D_ *0
continue work upon a central eating
place.

The Cathedral Student Lounge -
whose name was changed from Mixed
Lounge upon suggestion. of Dr. Flor-
ence M. Teagarden, professor of psy-
chology—wil1 be opened by next Sep-
tember, Executive Committee Chair;
man Leonard H. Marks, C35. aDI1011I10'
ed.

Upon suggestion of Frank Reich,
C36, chairman of the Curricula com-
mittee, the group seeking possible im-
provement in University courses was
increased by six, The new members will
be Roberta Nern, Ed36, Agnes Cala-
brese, BA35, Roger Haiisoii, C36, Bet-
ty Glass, C36, James Nicholas, E36,
and Edwin Banks, C39. _

Activity of his organization, R810-11
e):plained,' will be restricted to _ a
o,uestionnaire among the rep1'esen:"a-

tire students. Results of the work
will be reconiinended to a faculty
group.

Educational Forums

Miss Tliyrsa W. Amos. dean of wo-
men, described the educational
forums planned for 1935-36. “Vile want,
thi-oiigh these meetings to acquaint in-
terested students with the leading
trends in education both in this coun-
try and abroad,” she said.

According to Marks, Jess Penning-
ton.  is in charge of the Senior
l\len’s dinner on Monday, June 3. VVil—
son Loos, BA.".5, outlined the work of
his social committee, and reported a
$7 deﬁcit on the two SFA aftei'nooii
dances.

Motion for an SFA-created student
policy board for publications--that
“would not be a cen.sorsliip board” ac-
cording to its sponsors, “but a board
that should tell the student editor
wliat he should 1.‘.-l‘l1ll,, or what he
shouldn't print. wliicliever it is”—was
tabled indeﬁnitely by the Assembly.

Introducing a. bill to create a policy
board, George Strong, Junior assein-
blyman, complained that last year’s
semi—weekly Pitt News had prinietl ac-
counts of the Alpha-Beta campus po-
litical manipulations last spring. Un-
der a system whereby student editors
took instructions from a student
policy board, Strong said, suclr ac-
counts need not be printed,

Strong nientioiied that his plan
would set up a policy over The Owl
and The Panther, as well as over The
Pitt News. He urged that the detec-
tion of improper pictures and car-
toons might be a funi;-tion of the board.

After a motion by Jules Green, C35,
the Strong’s suggestions were tabled
by a vote of 24 to G.

Prob e Sessions
Continue Today

Attorney Wilner Promises More
Surprises From Quizzing

J. Alfred Vi-'ilner, plaintiff’s attorney
in the University investigation, prom-
ises. more “surprises” for the second
week-end session, which opens down-
town today.

Cciiiiiiienting on the case which be-
gins at 10 o’clock in the Council cham-
ber, the. young attorney told The
News: “I believe we shall have an
_interesting session today. Students

and faculty members have talked with

me conﬁdentially since last Saturday
and detailed violation of their rights
by the adininistration.

“Foriiier students and faculty mem-
bers will be called but none who are
now at the "University will be asked
to anpeai‘ unless they want to vol-
uiitarily.”

Mi‘. \-Vilner \Vednesday admitted he
was not certain whether he would
liave on the witness stand Dr. Ralph
E. Tiiriier, ousted history professor,
W’. Ellison Clialnieis, foriner economics
instructor, or Dr. Ralph E. Hinistead
of Syracuse university and chairman
of the committee of the American As-
sociation of University Professors,
which criticized the University in its
“Turner report.”

Dr. Turner was still in New York
1-‘fednesday, Mr. Clialmers in Detroit.
and Dr, Hinistead at Syracuse. Their
appeai'ance will depend on whether
the coniniittee is willing to subpoena
the three with the hope that it will
later 1'ec;e-ive funds from; the As-
seinbly.

C. F. C. Arensberg, Uni-versity at-
torney, asserted he had made no
plans for the University defense, say-
ing it. “depended on the testimony of-
fered.”

The session. will extend over until
tomorrow, then adjourn for two weeks
since no hearings will be held over
the Easter holidays.

Tomorrow Night

Winner Of Game May Claim
Na.tion’s Championship
Basketball Team

Just. at the time the College Asso-
ciation dance fans are checking their
wraps toiiiglit, Coach DI‘. H. C C-ai'lsori
will be s-hooing his Panther cagers
aboard a Pullman for their last trip
out of Pittsburgli this season.

’l‘he_v will be bound for Atlantic
City and the “Rose Bowl” classic with
Louisiana State-2's Tigers for the mythi-
cal national cliaiiipionship. If pre-
ganie predictions hold true, the Pan-
thers will play before the largest
crowd ever assembled under one roof,
since the Atlantic City auditorium,
the scene of the game, holds 40,000
people.

An old contention among animal
trainers'is that when Paiitliers and
Tigers mix it up, fur is bound to fly.
It is not likely that tomorrow night’s'
game will hurt that contention in the
least. The prowess of the Pitt team
is well known, while Coach Raben—
hoi-st’s crack ﬁve also has played
brilliantly enough to share  bit of
the iiaticiial spotliglit. All of which
proinises Atlantic City basketball fans

Newspaper reports from the South

concerning the Louisiana. State team
are enough to give Dr. Carlson head-
aches even before he sees the LSU
boys in action. All that the diminu-
tive Tiger team of the Bayous has
done this season has been to cl.own
its way to 12 conference wins t.o share
the Southern Conference title with
Kentucky, to average better than 48
points a game during tlie season, and
to present one of the Sout.h’s greatest
basket iall players in Captain

Some reports have it that VVade
with his ﬁve feet, seven inches, is

Social Science Report To Center
Interest Of ‘Conference

By Joseph Mccioskey

An. iiiiportaiit part of the joint meet-
ing -of the Peiinsylvaiiia. Historical
Association and the Annual History
conference of the University will be
the conference on the teacliiiig ofthe
social studies on Saturday afternoon,
April 20.

Ray 0. Huglies, assistant director
of curriculum study and research of
the Board of Public Education of
Pittsburgli, told The Pitt News VVed-
nesday that the discussions at this
conference will center around the re-
port of the social science commission
of the American Historical Associa-
tion, released in May, 1934.

After an‘ investigation extending
over a period of seven years, the com-
mission released a report which has
led to much controversy and to con-
siderable opposition from the more
conservative students of the social
sciences, In fact, four mein.bers of
the commission refused to Sign the
report because they considered it too
radical.

Mr. Hughes points out that the
failure by the coiimiissioii to deﬁne
the term “Collec.+.ivism” is the source
of most of the discussion. The report
states that the world is entering into
a period of “Collectivisni" but fails to
specify the "form, whether commu-
nistic, socialistic, or otherwise.

Among other things, the report
stresses the necessity of college pro-
fessors uniting to protect their rights,
tlie importance of academic freedom,
and the right of college professors to
engage in the social, political. and
economic. life of the comiiiunity in
which they are teaching.

College Association Offers Dancing _ .
Finale In Schenley Ballroom Tonight

 

Tonight at the Hotel Sclieiiley the
College Association offers musical ac-
companiment to its proverbial swan
song event.

How many couples will dance in
the in-ain ballroom to the music of
Fran E.ichler’s ten-man band from 9
to 1 o'clock is problematical. But
usually College Association member-
ship exceeds that of most other iiia-
jor University dances. About 300
couples are anticipated, according to
Don Canipbell, C35, president of the
CA.

Soon Campbell will no longer be
president of the Association. Soon
some other young chap will be super-

vising four dances over a year's

loan scholarship fund for needy stu-
dents.

Tonight Camp-bell will be dance
king for the last CA affair, although
he is slated to lead the Senior Ball
next Inonth.

Oscar Sclilossberg, C35, social
chairman, also quits active dance
duty tonight.

It’s formal tonight, and, for the

20 Years Make A Generation

“- "WENTY years have gone around the Sundial of

Trinity College, Cambridge, since Rupert
l‘-lrooke died. He was the most promising of the
poets of his generation, and he died in the British
campaign against the Dardaiielles. Before he died
he wrote down the belief of his generation in the
lines:

Now, God be tliankcd Wlio has matched us
with His hour,
And caught our jxoiilli, mid wakened us from
sleeping,
‘With hand made /;sll.l‘t"*._, clear eye, and sharpen.-
ed power,
To turn,  swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad—from a worhl turned old and cold and
weary.

Rupert Brooke and his generation believed that
the world war brought honor back to earth again,
rind that “Nobleness walks in our ways again.” He
went to the Dardarelles, and he died almost at
mice.

Another geiieration of Englislinien, studying at
'i:3a1iibridg'e, have lost belief in the nobleness of
war. Together with thousands of English stu-
dents, they have pledged that they will not take
up arms “in defense of King and Country.” They
drznv certain reactions to war from “Journey's
.i~.}nd," from “All Quiet on the \Vestern Front,”
froni “\Vhat Price (-‘:loi*_v“'-.”’ and from Sir Norman
Angeli and A. A. lllilne. They draw other reac-
tions from the economic consequences of the last
war, which have given Britain 15 bitter years.
../liid a few reii1eii:’.‘..mi~ ones, like Rupert Brooke,
who died.

After 20 years it. is i,'l.lf‘Rl,’r‘.l‘ to American students,
likewise, whether war is “God’s hour” or not. It
 clearer whether war is like “swimmers into
v.i:'-.lea.nness leaping”-—o'r like the proﬁteers and the
_patrioteers; like the dc:-itli of the frightened Ger-
man boy in ‘5All Quiet.”

Beyond whatever tumult and shouting may be
geiiei'ated today, as American collegians demon-

strate against the futil.it_\' and waste of war, re-
mains the iiiilieatcd social fact that a generation

War
“'0 IDE;\Vl‘IFIC‘ATIO.\T discs, one pending‘
from the other, were worn about the neck of

every American soldier during the \Vorld V\"ar. In
case a soldier became a battle casualty, one disc
was cut froui its string, and the other remained on
the body. A soldier who went without his identiﬁ-
cation discs was subject to court-martial.

’l‘o safeguard the identiﬁcation system even fur-
ther. the \\'ar Department. now considers a plan to
tattoo soldiers for future wars. It is explained
that the. identiﬁcation discs were not infrequently

blown to pieces along with that part of tlie wear-

er body from which the tags were suspended.

In a literal sense, the new identiﬁcation scheme
 practically bomb-proof. It suggests tattooing
the soldier on each shoulder and hip. If so much
as a. member remains, the casualty can be identi-
ﬁed and given what may be called decent burial.

“Basket cases,” newspaper accounts point out,
might cause some confusion in the hospital. A man
who had run point-blank into a high-explosive
shell might lose his identiﬁcation marks. But only
one soldier in about 5,000 goes to his death this
way.

So war becomes less horrible for the Graves Reg-

istration service.

SFA Petitions M“

ETTER than a‘ superﬁcial review of the ac-
coniplisliments of the Student-Faculty As-
sociation this year is the number of petitions sub-
iuitted by aspirants for seats in the University As-
sembly by the. deadline this week.

’l_‘he Executive committee was forced into special
sessions to consider nomination petitions of more
than a hundred and ﬁfty candidates, of whom not
more than thirty can be returned to the Assem-
bl_\'.

This is either a renaissance of the political in-
stinct, so long dormant according to popular mag-
azine article critics of the American educational
arena, or it. is a desire to share in increased stu-
dent" responsibility for one’s university career.

There cannot be too much realization on the parl:
of students that the University is their University.

Letters To The Editor 

Editor, Pitt News:

A certain group on the campus has circulated a hand-
bill concerning the Friday peace meeting. The purpose
of this liandbill is to discredit the student protest against
war by resorting to that old subterfuge of lampoonery
and ridicule, traditionally employed by those lacking
logical arguments to support their opposing views.

This particular example of ridicule reaches a new low
in its infantile droolings and forced humor, on a subject
deserving of the-most profound respect the uni-
versal desire for peace.

It may be that the writers of this circular do not
desire peace; most likely, liowever, they are laboring
under the false impression that only persons who will
fight under no circumstanccs—paciﬁsts——will participate
in such a rally. As has been pointed out, all persons, no
matter whether they believe in peace through a big navy
or by total disarmament, are welcome to attend
the only requirement being 3. sincere conviction against
the futility of imperialist war. If the writers of such
a. circular are unable or unwilling to inform themselves
of the true purpose of such a meeting, let them in the
future conﬁne their insipid wit to the treatments of the

Tales that get out about SFA meet-
ings and petitions: Two people got a
laugh out of SFA Marks’ remarks at
a recent SFA meeting, about his mak-
ing a check on the attendance of mem-
bers at meetings . . They were the
ones who actually did the work, Irene
Matveak and Jack Hammerschinidt.

Only two non-fraternity women have
ﬁled petitions for Junior Assembly-
woman.

One petitioner, name still unknown,
took the picture part of the applica-
tion seriously. His picture was big-
ger than the petition.

This thing about signing only six
petitions was unpopular with many
aniateur—professional Hancock handcr-
outers. But when Druids came around
with more petitions to sign, the air
was cleared somewhat. There’s notl1—
ing like a good slip of the old pen to
put pep in one, what?

An urgent request has been ﬁled
with the Pinchliitter to make public
the fact that Charles B. Holstein does
not, in any shape or ﬁgure, write
Pincliliittei"s bits. Chuck almost lost
any, all, and complete friendship with
SFAer Len Marks the other day over

Banks Turns €omm.emator
On Eurrent Campus Topics

By Edwin P. anks
7 HE ACTION BY SF.-\ relative to the organization of weekly discussion
meetings on the campus, at which various faculty men will address stu-
dents on topics of current interest, is commendable. However, it should go
'i''urtl1er. . -

While under the new program the University will have the Inquiry and
the In‘ternational Relatitziis forums offering mainly outside speakers. and
the proposed group with faculty ta.lks; arrangements should be deﬁnitely
made for greatly increasing the number of discussions led by students.

We do have the l‘.‘len's and the VVomen’s Debating Associations which
foster undergraduate speaking, it is true. But we still have the need for :1
Pitt group dedicated to the purpose of conducting weekly or bi-weekly cam-
pus meetings open to all students where students speak on subjects of im-
;iortance to them.

This Student Forum, as it might be called, should have an annual pro-
irram committee operating under SFA or the Y or even independently. The
-committee's function would be to select topics to be discussed and capable
students to lead the discussions. .

Questions considered might range from “Should campus publications be
directly controlled by the administration?” to “Is the establishment of a dic-
tatorship essential to the .return of American prosperity?” The method of
holding the forum niiglit range from having a single student speaker with a
subsequeiit question period to two or more speakers expressing different
points of view.

’ It is absolutely nece:-'sai'y, of course, that student speakers have adequate
preparation for their talks and that the topics be vital enough to draw cam-
pus attendance. The responsibility for the success of this project would lie
with the committee in charge, and the members of this group certainly would
be faced with a difficult job calling for patience, discrimination, and persist-
ence. The point is that, hard as the task would be, its effective accomplish-
ments would iniarlt a noticeable step in the progress of undergraduate educa-
«tion and laudablegorganization at the University.

A New God Fdri The Old ,_ . ,

At ’‘the_ College As_s‘o'ciartion‘assemblydn Memorial Hall Monday morning.
Dr. Marshall C. Muir, pastor of the Belleﬁeld Presbyterian church, gave a
very interesting lecture on religion and science.

As I understood him, the minister presented these signiﬁcant ideas.
First, he maintained that religion must prove its creed on the ﬁndings of
science. Second, religionists must change their old concept of God as a
capricious old man from whom favors are to be wheedled to a new concept
of God as the energizing force in human evolution. And, third, the truly
religious spirit manifest in all men, atheists, agnostics, or believers, who
have submerged themselves in their ideals.

Dr. Muir's ideas represent pretty well, I think, the intellectual revolt
of more and more modern younger clergymen. In them, moreover, are posi-
tive implications which should shock conservative believers out of their
news.

To accept the teacliiugs of science, ﬁrst of :.ill,»is throw out the mytho-
logical science of the Old '.l‘estament and probably the miracles of the New-
all of which leaves the Bible in the status of a book not divinely inspired,
nor infallible, but a. book, which contains among the chaff of superstitions,
mytlis, and legends, certain moral and ethical principles and a faith in mono-
tlieism still followed by present-day religionists. This theory also implies
that Jesus Christ must be understood as a human religious leader, and
while the greatest man of all time, not in any sense of the word a divinity.

The concept of God as force, or the clan vital of existence, means the
end of the concept of I-lell_and at least a totally different idea of Heaven.
ill‘ God is energy, It cannot be endowed with human"cliaracteristics; "there
can be no notion of disobedience or obedience toward It or any consequent
system of rewards and punishments meted out by It, Furthermore, a de-
personalized Creator is hardly an entity to whom man can bow down and
worship in any fashion. According to this religious philosophy, prayer can
have only a psychological value relating solely to the individual offering it.

Finally, to declare that atheists and agnostics can have the religious
spirit 'is to admit that the religious spirit embodies the relatonsliip of man
to«ma.n,iwithout-necessarily embodyingéany, relationship of man to God. Ac-
cording to this idea, then, the sincere Communists, for example, are among
the most religious people in the world today, despite their militant crusades
against any form of religion. Similarly, all reformers and revolutionists
who are dominated by their principles that they are willing to endure perse-
cution from the baiters of the established order are among the individuals
most thoroughly imbued with the religious spirit.

‘Spring, Spring, 0, Sweet Spring,’ Sighs
Lloyd As Bushes ‘Golder’ On Yon Hills

By Alan C. Lloyd
I-‘RING HAS come again to the
campus. and I do not say this be-
cause the bushes behind State hall are
again goldering the hillside, 1101‘ be‘
cause the grass has a fresh greeness.
nor because the trees behind Thaw
hall are sprouting their leaves. It is
true that the Cathedral of Learning
has renewed grandeur, now that its
head is in blue skies amid wisps of
clouds instead of the heavy, dirty rolls
of winter's fog.

The gloomy caverns of Alumni hall
are brightened with previews of
Easter’s new suits and hats. The sun
is shining again, and windows every-
where are daily opening wider. Yet
these are not final proof of the season.

The Wanderlust, lackadaisicality,
young-nien’s-fancies, moonlight and
warm breezes are to many the real
ti-umpeteers of spring. Professors
catch themselves staring out of“w1n-
(lows, and students answer, I-I_un,
“Huh?” to even the most clear, point-
ed questions. This, however, is but
an academic spring, and is not direct-
ly connected to weather.

W'hen young sorority pledges sit by
open windows instead of beside a fire

place. supposedly studying, and when ,

fraternity men buy new songsheets,
houseniothers begin to smile remi-
niscently, and say, “I do believelsprlng
is back again. Jane, we'll start house-
cleaning Saturday mo1‘niI1g- P11 ten
Paul to have the pledges here.” Still,
we can hardly start a calendar by such
opinion. I once knew a housemother

Our big bug specialists, too, have
announced that Plantesicus Migra-
torius was seen picking about on the
Cathedral lawn, and that the dread

stooges stop their tlunkyization, and
when young men begin to neologize,
we can be just about certain that
spring is actually here. But despite
these trivia, the real proof is: the

their hibernaculum for the fresh air

Panther N etmen
Anchor At Navy

Face Middies Today, Georgetown
Tomorrow To Wind Up Tour

Continuing its Eastern invasion, the
‘Panther tennis team will ﬁght it out
with the Georgetown nezters at Vash-
ington this afternoon.

The ‘Pitt courtmen will play their
last match in the East tomorrow aft-
ornoon, when they take on the Naval
Academy team at Annapolis in an at-
tempt at a revenge victory.

Last year the Middies trounced the
lmnthers 8-1, giving the locals their
only defeat of the season. It was
Captain Ganger's stellar play against
f;\[cClung, the Navy ace, that saved
Pitt from a complete washout. The
Geoigetown university match of last
season was rained out.

Dave O’Loughlin. Panther tennis
coach, will probably rely upon the fol-
lowing netmen to wind up the barn-
storn1ing tour with victories: Bob
f.\~ladden as the No. 1 man; Joe Mad-
den in the No. 2 position; Jim Slo-
cum at the No. 3 post; Clyde Miller
as the No. 4 man; Roy Heckler in the
No. 5 position; and Jimmy Thompson
;~.s the No, 6 man.

Now that the varsity football man-
-'.lf_.’,'BI‘S, Stewart M,cAwley and Joe
‘Rodgers have the managerial end of the
team well in hand, they have time to
interview any freshman or sophomore
students interested in becoming man-
ogers.

Any candidates are reqnestecl to re-
port to either Rodgers or l\IcAwley at

after 3:30 o’clock. As yet all of the

lnterfraternity Ball Leagues Reach
Second Round After Belated Start

 

If the gods of the weather are will-
ing’. Greek mushball will have pro-
gressed to the second round play in
all three leagues tonight.

League “B” was scheduled for the
ﬁrst loop g:-rm-es; however, rain and
a. light snow reversed the schedule so
that this league will be the last one
to complete ﬁrst-round encounters on
the Schenley oval ﬁelds.

Rules that will apply to all games
in the I11te1‘fraternity tournament are:
1. Each team will be composed of
nine players, and oﬂicial softball rules
will govern all games. :3. Games will
be of seven innings’ duration unless
called by rain or darkness, in which
case ﬁve innings must have been
played in order for the game to count
in the percentage column.

All questions on ineligibility and in-
terpretation of the rules will be de-
cided by the Interfraternity athletic
committee, com-posed of co-chairmen
George Golanty, Sigma Alpha Mn, and
Milton Margoli-s, Phi Epsilon Pi, and
Mr. Seidle, faculty adviser. ‘

In this year’s tourney, the 13 Greek
