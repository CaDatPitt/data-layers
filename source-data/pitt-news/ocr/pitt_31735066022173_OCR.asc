University

groups urge

the passage
of Cowell Bill

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

The United Faculty and other campus
groups are circulating petitions today
supporting the amendment to the state
Right To Know law that would open the
records of Pitt and other state-related
universities. '

“We want the message to come through
loud and clear in Harrisburg that large
numbers of people at Pitt do support the
bill," United Faculty President Philip Wion
said.

-The Staff Association Council and the
Student Government Board are also
circulating the petitions.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Ron Cowell
(D.-Wilkins), will probably be discussed
in a public hearing in the house education
committee in mid-September.

The state house passed the bill with a"
202-1 vote, and the senate will vote on it
later in the fall. ' .

Wion said the bill is needed to keep Pitt
administrators responsible to taxpayers.

The $240 million in state funds that Pitt
receives “can’t be traced,” Wion said.
“Under [pressure Pitt officials] revealed top
salaries of administrators, but other kinds
of financial informations just aren’t
available. I

“We think our faculty, staff and students
believe it’s important that the bill be
passed to ensure that the kind of secrecy
that’s led to so many problems is stopped,”
Wion said.

Pitt administrators have‘ been saying,
“We’re a public institution when it comes
to getting state money but a private
institution when it comes to opening
records,” according to Wion.

~Pitt spokespeople have said the
university administration “does not oppose
the bill in principle.”

Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor said
the bill is a “complex issue.” O’Connor
said in the last week of August the bill is

not specific regarding which records fall

under the proposed amendment.

“There are some things that you wouldn’t
want in the public domain, that shouldn't
be in the public domain,” O’Connor said. V
He said research contract proposals and
other confidential materials would fall
under that category. '

The Right To Know Law,. enacted in
1957, states that any state agency must
reveal most financial records, including
the acquisition and allocation of money
and the receipt or use of materials,
equipment and property.

If passed, the amendment would extend
the Right To Know Law to cover private '
institutions such as the University of
Pennsylvania and Drexel University, which
receive state funds, as well as the four

‘major state-related universities: the

University of Pittsburgh, Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln. ’

Local conservatives, liberals split on Thomas

By Megan Bertino

Asst. News Editor

Conservative groups rally

and liberals mobilize as
Clarence Thomas’ confirmation
hearings bring him one step
closer to a seat on the Supreme
Court

“Thomas represents not only
the economic, political and
legal struggle that black people
are having with the powers
that be; he also represents a
struggle black people are
having within themselves,” said
Joanne Thomas, Blacleline
editor for the Black Action
Society. A

“He knows the difference
between right and wrong, yet
he’s ignored this truth in order
to accept a position that was
handed to him just to appease
minority groups,” she said.
“What Afro—American, male or
female, would oppose
affirmative action, a presidential
policy constructed to prevent
discrimination on all bases,

"especially when Thomas is a

product of it?”

Thomas was head‘ of the
Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission for eight
years. “_

During his tenure at the
EEOC, Thomas changed his
stance on affirmative action
several times. A

Thomas said affirmative
action hurts minority groups
because it makes them
dependent on the government
Thomas was admitted to Yale
University law school under an
affirmative-action program.

Jacinta Dvorak, president of
College Republicans, said, “He's
very qualified  Thomas is a
great man with a lot of judicial
‘insight. It really bothers me that
people are calling him a token
black when he has such great
judicial authority.” ,

Greg Spicer of the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance is

‘ concerned about «Thomas

sharing the same conservative
views on ‘civil rights as other
Supreme Court jurors.

“Thomas’ conﬁrmation would .

,_,4 ,- .. 11: ,.4.._. 4«4..».v..-‘.¢..ou..4.

cement a court full of justices
who worship state power over
the interest of the individual.
Thomas’ confirmation is so
frightening because it brings
the court one step further to
completely silencing an
individual’s freedom of choice,"
he said.
' ‘ University Democrats
President Joel Leonard shares
this concern for civil rights. “I
see the court taking a definite
ultra-conservative shift to the
right. lThomas’l confirmation
concerns me because I can see
that personal freedoms and
liberties in this country will be
threatened for the next several
decades,” he said.

Scott Jeffries, of Black
American_ Law Students
Association, said, “I think it is a
good thing that Bush was
conscienable enough to‘ go
along with another black
person, but I don’t think it was

necessary.”Jeffries said Thomas _

is‘ an interesting candidate
because “he shows that blacks

are more diverse thanpeople

Max Miller of BALSA said he ‘
is concerned that the strong‘ _ 
dissentingopinionandactivism ’ A I '

of Thurgood Marshall will not
be carried out by Thomas.
“It is my hope that Thomas

will preserve some of the

activism of Marshall,” Miller
said. ‘ ’

When questioned ‘about his ‘
views on political activism at
confirmation"

hearings, Thomas ‘ said he
believed it was a justice’s job to

interpret the constitution,“ not 

impose his opinion. ' « A

Chris Helsel, co-president of — - 

Campus Women's Organ-
ization, said CWO strongly
opposes Thomas’ nomination.

Helsel said CWO sees’ ‘
Thomas as another justice in .

Not everyone was pleased with
the way the fair was organized.
Melissa Smith, co—president of
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, which was not
represented at the fair, felt
excluded from the festival. “No
one actively made sure we were
here.”

"‘It’s just too ironic,”' she said.
“Here again we’re speaking of
cultural diversity, and again gays,
lesbians and bisexuals are not a
part of this, are invisible. Again
we are not recognized.”

She also’ objected to ‘a
predominantly white-male
singing group opening the
festival.

Tim Jackson, a Pitt sociology
graduate who was involved with
this year’s cultural diversity week,
said, “We sent out information to
groups. There were postings of
events welcoming everyone.

Students Against Racism co-
sponsored the event with the -
Office of Student Activities, the
Office of New Student Programs
and several other organizations.

Chris Moleski, president of
Students Against Racism, said that
events which spread ideas about
diversity can only be helpful.

“Diversity opens minds and gets
rid of ignorance about other
cultures. People may even find
they enjoy learning about other
cultures. I worked a summer-job
where half the people there spoke
Spanish. That is a reality we have
to adjust to,” he said. .

Armondo Sciullo, a senior in
pre—rned, said, “Diversity is a good
idea, and it is great that there are
things like this fair to help promote
it. The university has a very diverse 9
population_,_ and it is a good idea
to expand our knowledge of other
cultures.”

‘ . each weekday.
._ A true democracy must represent the entire spectrum of
cultural diversity, Manning Marable said.

Marable, a sociologist and historian, spoke about multiculturalism
for the Celebration of Diversity festival last night.

Marable argued that dialogue cannot exist on the basis of
“superior and inferior.”

Systems of inequality and oppression of minority groups are
the genuine impediments to this dialogue, he said.

A new racism has arisen in the United States that is holding back

'-minorities, a'ccording to Marable. Efforts aimed at promoting
minorities and making up for past injustices are labelled as _
-reverse discrimination, he said.

“If blacks, women and Latinos actually controlled institutions
which dictate white life, like banks, major corporations,
governments or even the judiciary, then there could be the ability
to oppress whites. But they don’t, and affirmative action makes
only the slightest difference in racial and cultural inequalities.”

In order to create a pluralistic democracy, universities and

’ oppressed groups must be “aggressive and innovative and
involved in strategic planning to create diversity and equality.

“No political emancipation is conceivable without empowerment
of people of color, women, gaysand lesbians and any other -I
oppressed group,” he said.

Continued from page 1
support the abortion issue so that the pro-
life amendment will hopefully in the future
become a reality,” Collins said.

Students for Life believe that Thomas
will rule against Roe vs. Wade based on
statements he made in 1987 indicating that

V the pro-life argument was a “splendid

example of applying natural law.”
Natural law is an ancient theory that
says there are principles higher than any
written law. l
At Tuesday's conﬁrmation hearings,

Thomas played down his interest in natural
law, claiming he explored natural law

‘ only as political theory. He also said he

saw no role for natural law in constitutional
adjudication.

The question of Thomas’ qualifications
has also been raised by some objectors.

Pitt law Professor John Burkoff said, “I
don’t think he has had a sufficient amount
of experience as a lawyer to serve on the
Supreme Court.” 

Thomas has never argued a case before
a federal court.

Arthur Hellman, also a Pitt law professor,
supports Thomas. “From what I have read,
he certainly seems to be a strong nominee
and will bringan interesting perspective
to the court. Thomas has very strong
credentials, and I certainly see nothing 
that proves he should not be confirmed.”

Burkoff argues that Thomas’ perspective
would make him “a terrible Supreme
Court justice  He’s far too rigid in his
ideological views and would .not pay
sufficient attention to issues before the
court.”

Doubting Thomas

It has become unfortunately clear that Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas will be confirmed to the high
court soon enough.

Much like George Bush’s previous nominee, David
Souter, Thomas is learning that the best way to shelter his
conservative opinions about civil liberties is to reply in
roundabout, semantic circles.

His answers on the controversial subject of abortion are
especially confusing. Thomas had once" praised Lewis
Lehrman’s essay on natural law, which states that there are
certain natural rights guaranteed to all citizens, such as the
right to life and possession’ of property.

Of course, his appraisal has more than angered. the
National Organization for Women. To pacify NOW, Sen.
John Danforth, Thomas’ chief sponsor in the Senate, said
that Thomas, “at no time attempted to apply natural law
theory to rights of privacy or to the whole question of
abortion. That is an open issue with him, in no way
foreclosed by anything that he has said on natural laW,”
according to the Pittsbumb Post-Gazette. _

Another pointof much controversy is Thomas’ view on
affirmative action. Yale chose him in 1971 as part of a new
affirmative action program, with a goal of raising the
minority level at the university to 10 percent. Admissions
dean James Thomas of Yale said of Thomas, “I have no
doubt that in some measure Clarence was preferred
because of his background.” ’

So why, then, does Thomas vehemently oppose
affirmative action? One reason could be that his admission
to Yale was mostly based on his race and not on his
academic achievements. 8 .

More questionable than his views on controversial
subjects is Thomas’ lack of judiciary competence. A wise
decision cannot be made until more information regarding
Thomas’ experience is disclosed. 1

The emotional, never-ending. tales of poverty and
loneliness may evoke sympathy, but we need hard
evidence in order to make a qualified judgement on his
ability to sit on the highest bench in the land.

Thomas became a federal court judge only a little over
a year and a half ago. With that amount of inexperience,
there is no way we can tell exactly where his priorities lie.

Special interest groups have a right to be nervous about
the near—appointed Thomas, but since Thomas has not
ruled on many utterly significant cases, their worries don’t
have much solid evidence behind them. 0

~ Liberal, Thomas is not. Acting like a liberal, however, he
is doing well. It is typical for a nominee with such a
controversial background to try and cover up his views.
Souter swung to the left during his confirmation hearings
and acted the complete opposite once he joined the court.

What would you do if someone
handed you $82,000? Speaking
from the average student's
perspective, the possibilities are
endless —‘-—especially to one who
graduates in April and faces a
less than thriving job market.

Pitt President J. Dennis
O’Connor and the administration
found a disturbing way to spend
our money, to say the least. Did
they use it to offer more
scholarships to students, improve

the North and South Oakland —

shuttle service or hire a few more
campus policemen to make our
streets at little safer? NO. They
decided to redecorate the
president’s new office and once
again shower our top executive
in complete opulence.

After all the, scandals
surrounding the university this
past year, ‘caused by misuse of
funding and a more-than-
generous retirement package for
ex-President Wesley Posvar, I
believed the new president would
start his tenure off on a higher
note. ,

Instead he's buying $13,402
drapes, a $3,200 mahogany desk
and $16,006 in rugs and carpeting,
to name just a few items on the
long price list-' totaling $82,000.

How is this justified after the
tuition increase we just received?
My parents have saved for my
education (and my brother’s)
since they got married over 25
years ago. There are many other
students who are not as fortunate

Otlaer uses for $ 82, 000 Ce   expense

f Barbara
Hoffmann

as I am.

They work endless hours, worry
that their loans will not be
approved and hope they have
enough money to make it through
four years of school. Then,’ on
that happy graduation day, they
are faced with the bills they have
accumulated throughout their
college careers.

The average cost per year at
Pitt is about $7,000. Eighty-two

thousand dollars would fall $2,000 .

short of paying for three full four-.
year scholarships. It would even
give '11 students the option to go
to Pitt this year for free.

- Eighty-two thousand‘ dollars
would provide housing for 27
small families this year in a $250-
a—month apartment — not a
palace, but a place that would get
a family off the street and out of
the cold. 0

103,000 hot meals could be
served at the Rainbow Kitchen
for $82,000. 160 people could
receive one meal a day for two
years.

After donations, federal aid
and’ low cost or free food, the
Rainbow Kitchen operates on a
budget of about $40,000 a year-
only half of the $82,000 spent on
O’Connor’s office. 0

This money could also help

those removed from abusive

homes. 0
Just picture an abused woman,

unable to leave her husband

because she simply does not have .

the money to support herself and
her children.

The HOPE Center for battered
women operates on a budget of
about $85,000 a year. The shelter

houses 20 people. Eighty-‘two -

thousand dollars can support 10
women with one child each for
an entire year.

The Bradley Center also deals

with abuse. Room and board for
one child at this protection agency
costs. $4,370. ' .

For $82,000 a child could live

in this facility from the time of
birth to the age of 18 with $3,340
left over. after graduating from
high school.

.These are just some of the _ 3

ways $82,000 could be used to
improve the lives of the low-
profile middleeclass or, more

importantly, poor citizens. This .

money’ could ha e easily been
donated to seve al deserving
organizations.

If Dr. O’Connor was so

concerned with the well-being of
the Pitt community (which also

 

includes the needy in Pittsburgh),   

one would think he might be
able to sacrifice a decorative office

for the happiness of a few.

unfortunate human beings.

Hrd—hitters eady to amage the Oaklandunderground t

By Dominic Conti
For The Pitt News

San Francisco sludgemasters and bowling virtuosos,
The Melvins, will be gracing the bespattered and befilthed
streets of Oakland Sept. 17 for an appearance at the
Upstage. Not for everyone are The Melvins. Known
almost exclusively for their deafening live sound, these
twits have been cracking plaster since T982 and have
caused more than one west coast wimp to wobble out of
a local club where The Melvins have been pounding, legs
unsteady, blood streaming from his ears, unable to even
hear his own screams.

This is not to say that The Melvins are necessarily all
that stellar of a band, live or on record. They’re not. (This

‘§1£5E3.G3k‘ﬂ$9‘5§:&§1‘l¢'l6:£ﬁ3ﬁ’:9I£’.£3k:i;V§E£ '€':i3i'Pl:¢5§?ﬂ'.-§'3li."ia'¢Z$f‘£v3‘&?§’ﬁl\‘€il&-'l07'£Efﬂiﬁaﬁgﬁrfﬁ-' » J .' ” '

V reviewer has had mixed opinions about them for years.)

They're just loud. Jesus, are they loud.

Yeah, no one could ever accuse The Melvins of not
having a thick, full, live sound. And their records, I might
add, are no exception. Bullhead, their newest, is a
bludgeoning maelstrom‘ of one—dimensional riff rapery.
As the record goes on and you begin to think that the next
song could not possibly be louder and slower and just
more freakin‘ basic than the last one, The Melvins
proceed to amp it up  and slow it down, thus carving
you a new butthole pronto.

The opening song, “Boris,” a seven-minute opus about
God knows what, starts the rec off in typical Melvins’
fashion: slow, loud and above all long. Songs like
“Anaconda” and “If I Had an Exorcism,” two particularly

memorable tunes, provide more of the same.’ Worth
noting, however, is theone lonelchange of“pace'on
Bullhead. ?‘Zodiac” is a bastard hybrid child of Sabbath’s

. “Into the Void" and Iron Butterﬂy’s “In A Gadda Da Vida”

and could stand to teach Metallica a thing or two until it
eventually slows back down to the speed of mud. 
At this point it should be mentioned, before more
useless song-by-song deliberation is done, that a Melvins
record is best listened to, if listened to at all, on a
conceptual basis; that is, all at once, with little attention
to which song comes when or what each particular song

sounds like. The songs on Bullhead (or any Melvins songs ‘

for that matter) thurnp, scream and drone along for a

‘ while, and then they end. ‘Not much else needs be said.

Continued from page S-1
They all pretty much sound the
same, so what the hey, huh?

So what's good about The
Melvins, if anything, you ask?
Well it's essentially the same
elemental, yet so essential, thing
that made bands like The Stooges,
AC/DC and Robert Johnson as
great as they were —— mastery of
the simple concept: simple bands
(guitar, bass,’ drums, vocals);
simple riffs and simple lyrics (pain,
degradation, girls, etc.). The
Melvins aren’t fit to scrub any of
the aforementioned’s kitchen
ﬂoors, but they do have a firm
grasp of what it takes to be a solid
rock band, and that’s basically
what makes them worthwhile.

The Melvins play to the beat of
your heart and the pounding of
your blood -— that one internal
rhythm that makes everyone rock
at least just a little bit and that

everyone can- feel and relate to. .

They’ve mastered The Beat. You
know, that one Beat, man! The
Beat! Depending on how much
you appreciate a band with a
simple one—two punch like The

Melvins, how much you dig the
Beat should easily determine
whether or not Bullhead (or The
Melvins’ two previous LPs, Gluey
Porch Treatmentand Ozma) is for
you or not.

Ultimately doing one thing well
and one thing only has its
drawbacks. A booming, simple,
loud sound is almost‘ always
immediately captivating, but it
seldom sticks with you for the
long haul unless there’s some
intelligence and variety in there,
too. T hat’s what makes fairly
contempo, heavy, loud bands like
Killdozer and The Swans so good.
Because in the end, The Melvins’
sound is, well, dumb. If you’re in
the mood for one—speed, one-
chord decimation, then The
Melvins are it, but there’s only so
much “boom, crunch” the average
person with an IQ greater than
your average sea cucumber
should be able to take before you
call it a day and slap a Foetus
record on or something.

_ The Kelly Affair, Cold Water
Flat and Bunjie Jambo will be
opening for The Melvins.

3 drug—induced singles

You’re born, and you’re
destined to die. Somewhere in
the middle you plan on existing
in the rat-race, striving for your
three-bedroom piece of swiss, all
the while condemning yourself
to a life of unrelenting order.
These three seven-inch singles
may not help you find inner
peace but will most assuredly
take you to the other side and
back again, returning with a slick
ﬁlm of viscous jelly covering your
entire body. This is my trip and
this is how I see it: '

to yourself, “Gee, I wish I had an
LSD—inspired soundtrack?” Your
average encompassing vibrations

exploration via acid? Or maybe
you’ve never taken the plunge
into the eerie rhapsodies that
tripping suggests and want.to be
encompassed by jerk-with-your-
reality senses without the use of
chemicals?

Sonic Boom, half of the
legendary mind-warpers Space-

upward since the breakup of the

“other” half) has always seemed
to go for soothing melodies, while
Sonic has represented his

seven-inch proves that apart from
the Spacemen, his projects still

glimmer and exude an innovative

mind-bending quality. He serves
a platter full of what-you-make—it
compositions. There are no
words, no snappy choruses, no
foot—stomping beats. Nope. This
is dope. No chance this is dance.

These three songs are intended
to broaden your mind, ‘close off
the insidious plays of the outside

and gently lull you into a,

kaleidoscope of the unknown.

OK, so there’s always room for
personal interpretation, but one
thing remains clear: These little
ditties will drive you to a catatonic,
sedate state of mind.

The Drone Dream EP can be
played at any speed. Yet any way
you listen to it, it still produces
the same hallucinogenic effects.
This is whatl saw: “Octaves” is a
humongous vibration that drones
and pulses to a hypnotic wave.
“T remelos” is a Frankenstein-
suppressed wheel that never
completely circles and never ends.
“Ecstasy in Slow Motion” melts

into a mesmerizing, electronic.

THE PI'l'I' NEWS, Thursday, September 12,1991

 

Continued from page S-1
composer awaiting execution for
the murder of his wife, Margaret

, (Emma Thompson) in 1949.

Strauss appears psychotic when
.\being interviewed for the last

,_ time by reporter Gray Baker

(Andy Garcia) right before the
execution, and when Baker asks
him if he did indeed murder his
wife, Strauss responds with a

whisper in his ear. At the end of

the procession to the execution,
Strauss sees his wife standing in
front of him, at which point he
pulls out a hidden pair of scissors
'and makes a motion to kill her.
But how can she be there if she
is already dead?

The story shifts to the present
with a woman (also played by
Thompson) waking up from a
nightmare, screaming. She is mute
and suffers from amnesia and is
taken under care by an
orphanage. When the head priest
of the orphanage decides she
causes more problems than she
is worth, he calls upon Mike
Church (also played by Branagh),
a private investigator, to find her

identity.

Church names the woman
Grace and attempts to unravel
her past, all in the hopes of
finding her present. After
consulting a down-and-out
psychiatrist, who is now working
in a supermarket (played by
Robin Williams in a cameo
appearance), Church takes Grace
to hypnotist Franklyn Madson
(Derek Jacobi). There they learn
about Grace’s past existence in
another lifetime. The time is the
late 1940s, and the lives are those
of Roman and Margaret Strauss.
As a result of the hypnosis, Grace
recovers her ability to speak but
not her memory. '

Church displays a- cynical
skepticism at first, but when
Madson convinces him to
undergo hypnosis as well, Church
learns that he is tied to the past
existence of Roman and Margaret
Strauss. At ﬁrst it is assumed that
Church represents Roman
reincarnated, and Grace
represents Margaret; however
through a twist of fate, the roles
have been reversed. Williams
refers to fate as “the only cosmic
force with a tragic sense of
humor.” Here fate certainly plays
a witty trick on the characters.
Initially Grace fears that Church
will reenact the ‘scenario and
murder her again; however once
Church learns that he in fact is
Margaret reincarnated,’ he
develops the same fear against
her. So who dies? Who lives? The
ending offers quite a clever

surprise.

Dead Again is a well-crafted
motion picture. Flashbacks are
represented in black and white
to offer enhanced images of the
past, yet sometimes a hazy sense
of color trickles through to
possibly offer a reference to the
future. The soundtrack
complements the ﬁlm as well,
especially in a scene where
Church and Grace first realize
their dilemma during their
argument: Church’s neighbor
below him is playing haunting
scales that progressively increase
in volume. Sort of a present tie-
in with the musical past of Roman
and Margaret.

The title Dead Again is‘

misleading. Without giving away
the entire plot, it is safe to reveal
that no one “dies again,” and the
romance and mystery are stressed
far more than the suspense. Also
the casting of Robin Williams
and Andy Garcia seems quite
inappropriate.-The two dynamic
actors, whose talents more often
than not require much greater
attention than minor supporting
roles, are out of place. Williams
does not make a convincing
psychiatrist — at least not when

he is given only a few minutes to ,

try, and Garcia does not make a
convincing Pulitzer Prize-winning
reporter for the same reason.
Despite these minor short-
comings, Dead Again is a highly
entertaining film that offers much
more than just a -romance or
suspense thriller could.

do much except rake leaves in the front yard. The musicians,
however, keep the song in a constant fit of rage that may have
been grasped from the deep interments of hell.

“Apparatus Of Love” shines as a single. It’s a slow, melodic
song that erupts into an enormous cacophony of whirling and
all-consuming dizziness. Harsh guitars are matched with‘ a
soothing lead vocalist, Ret A La Quesne, who is reminiscent of
Velvet Underground’s Nico. It’s an incredibly intoxicating four
minutes that make me feel warm inside. The guitars buzz while
the damsel whispers breathy nothings during what appears to be
foreplay. And best yet, it’s easily hummed so it’s meat can be
retained throughout the day.

Slug
Painbaby 7" EP
Magnatone Records

Imagine Frank Booth in “Blue Velvet” slurping his nitrous and
the dazed ecstasy he appears to revel in afterwards: the blinded
violence, the sexual perversion, the consuming inebriation.
“Mommy, I don’t want to writhe in sludge!" You don’t want to
admit it, but you do; You also want to be whipped and slapped
until the pain is so excruciating, it feels good. Perhaps listening
to this four—song EP will prime you for a life of sado-masochism.

Wipe off the slobber oozing down your chin and wake the hell
up. Fulﬁll your sick fantasies elsewhere. But let Slug coerce you
to their other side — one where senses are dulled and
pummelled and evil reigns queen. It’s heavy. Ouch!

“Sore Thumb", “Painbaby” and “Freak of a Nature” capture the
sounds of extreme pain: discordant, heavy and gut—wrenching,
with insightful sound bites galore. Slug is like trying to see
through a haze of muck, like Monster Magnet’s dope sounds.

“Aversion” is a stellar single. It’s raw and uncooked 'l‘.bone
that tingles the teeth and stretches the jaw as you tear at the meat.
The grungy vocals overlap with the scummiest sludge that they
could dig up. The milky mire may prompt you to pillage your/
neighbor or submerge yourself in bodily waste. Itcends in a
propeller of climactic screams and rage. If this doesn’t make you
want to go out and rip stuff up, then I don’t know what will.
Ouch, mommy  it hurts  but I like it.

TI,-IE PI'Ifl‘ NEWS, Saturday, September 14, 1991

By Rob A. Mazur
Sports Editor '

At the beginning of this new
football season, everyone talked
of how Pitt had lost eight starters
and had many players in other
difficulties.

After training camp at
Johnstown, fans assumed a wait-
and—see position. They had heard
that this new team looked hungry
and like it really meant business.
The schedule ahead looked
unfavorable, with a tough contest
in Morgantown against a West
Virginia team that had humiliated
the Panthers at home the year
before and Southern Mississippi,
a bowl participant in 1990 and a
traditional upset specialist, in the
home opener.

Many_foresaw the first Pitt defeat
in a home opener since the
Panthers faced Maryland in a
Labor Day contest five years ago.

What seemed impossible just a
little over a month ago has come
true — the Panthers defeated the

Mountaineers 34-3 in a nationally

 

0 impressive victories

televised ESPN game and handily
sent Southern Mississippi away
35-14.

This Panther team differs from
the team of a year ago in one
aspect — they play as a team.
After last week’s victory over the
8. Miss. Golden Eagles, senior
comerback Sfeve Israel credited

the entire defense for helping‘/I/‘W

with his performance.

“We play like one big machine,
and everybody plays a part in
that machine,” Israel said. _

That came after Israel had just
played one of the best games of
his career, returning an
interception 81 yards for a score
to halt the Eagles’ first drive and

returning a fumble 35 yards late ,

in the game to thwart yet another
Golden Eagle scoring attempt.
Israel also had another apparent
touchdown off a punt return
called back on a clipping penalty.

For his efforts against Southern
Mississippi, Israel was named Big
East conference Defensive Player
of the Week. He was not the first

Panther to garner this honor’,"\ 

however. Ricardo McDonald,
senior outside linebacker,
received the same honor a week
previously for his efforts in the
West Virginia game.

A third senior who has been a
major factor in the Pitt turnaround
is running back Glenn Deveaux.
After playing much of last season
in the shadow of Curvin Richards,
Deveaux has been described as
the “rock that holds the running
backs together" by head coach
Paul Hackett. This year Deveaux

has become the Panthers go-to,,,.;

man. .

The re—emergence of these
seniors to lead the Panthers is not
merely coincidental, with the
Panthers’ rise from the depths of
college football.

Hackett has maintained all
along that if the team is to be
successful, the seniors must
provide a solid leadership role

for thegyounger players to follow. S

One such young player who

seems to have taken to followingﬁ

the example of those around him
is first-year linebacker Tom
Tumulty. When Tumulty came
out of Penn Hills High School last
year, he was hailed as possibly
Pitt's best recruit.

By the third day of camp,
Tumulty had proven himself
worthy of the starting job. Even
more impressive is the fact that in
his first down in a Panther
uniform, Tumulty made the first

Pitt tackle of the 1991 season. 6'

Other factors have played a
part. in the Panther comeback
thus far, but overall team unity
has been ‘die main force. If the

Panthers are to continue with the ,_

success they have had thus far,
they must preserve this delicate
relationship.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Saturday, September 14, 1991

Swift Burch (left) leads a senior-dominated defense which forced three Pitt turnovers a year ago.

By Derek P. Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

After giving up 41 points and
481 yards to Alabama last week,
Temple coach Jerry Berndt said
his defense “had some major
breakdowns.”

come Saturday.
The, Temple defense always
A seems to play Pitt with that “bend,
don’t break” attitude. In last year’s
28-18 Owl win at Pitt, the Panthers
accumulated 387 yards of total
offense in a fairly balanced attack
(196 rushing and 193 passing).
The big problem for Pitt was
putting the ball in the endzone.
The Owls’ secondary intercepted
Alex Van Pelt three times, twice
ending long drives and the other

touchdown.

Seven starters return‘ from the
1990 edition, and 10 defensive
starters are seniors. The stars are
the linebacking corps and the
secondary. ‘“As a unit, our

Don’t expect the same thing ‘

setting up, the final Temple.

_ linebackers are outstanding,” said
Berndt, “and individually, they
are all very good.”

Inside linebacker Santo
Stephens is the leader. Stephens
racked up 112 tackles in 1990
and also picked off two passes.
Teamingwith Stephens on the
inside is Kevin Cary, who is in his
first year as a starter.

The outside ‘backers are Gregg
Angeli and James Harris. Angeli
is the designated pass rusher,
having ranked second on the
team in quarterback pressures
and third in sacks a year ago.

_ Harris is 6-feet 8—inches, 267
pounds and an impressive athlete.
“He’s their ‘drop’ linebacker,
which means he covers tight ends
and running backs,” said Pitt head
coach Paul Hackett. Harris
recorded four sacks last year,
even though he was a reserve
and played defense for the first
yean

The secondary is led by senior
free safety Tony Schmitz, who
had three interceptions and four
pass deflections last year, as well
as 52 tackles. Roverback Mark
Ellis and cornerman Ron Bruce
both have game experience, as
does sophomore Kyle Glasper,
the youngest and smallest
member of the group.‘

“They are very experienced,”

P P Van Peltsaid. “They play together

really well, use lots of schemes,
and they’re good at disguising
coverages.” Indeed, Van Pelt’s
12-for—25 passing performance
against the Owls last year was not
one of his best, nor was it entirely
his fault.

The front three are anchored
by tackle Swift Burch and
averages nearly 300 pounds a
man. That’s largely due to the
presence of 540—pound nose
guard Alphonso Taylor, who is
also a first-year starter. The other
tackle is senior Eric Fenwick. The
Owls lost backup nose guard

‘*"‘" Scott Holland for the season when

he fractured his left leg last week,
so depth is thin on the front line.

The Owls gave up two long
touchdown runsto the Crimson
Tide last week (85 and 86 yards)

' and seem more vulnerable to the
run than the pass. V

The defense thrives on forcing
teams into third-and-long
situations because of the quality
of their nickel package defense.
The obvious solution, according
to Van Pelt, isto simply avoid
those third-and-a-mile plays
altogether. “We have to Continue
to balance our running and
passing to keep defenses off-
guard,” said Van Pelt.

0 As Hackett reminds us, this is
a team which has beaten Pitt,
largely because of two factors:
quarterback Anthony Richardson
and an opportunistic defense,
which capitalizes on opponents’
mistakes. .

Even though the Temple
defense was “out of synch” last
week, as Berndt put it, playing
Pitt always seems to motivate the
Owls even more.

“Coach Berndt said that last
year’s win made their season,”
Hackett said. “\X/ell,“I think that a
win Saturday would make this
season for them, too.”

Last Season’s meeting with the

Temple Owls was a frustrating

experience for quarterback Alex
Van Pelt.

Twelve completions in 25 I

attempts. Three costly
interceptions. Temple humiliated

the Panthers 28-18 in a.game that ,

wasn’t even as close as the score
indicates.

“In my career l’ve never felt
worse about a loSs,” Van Pelt
said. “I’d like to come out and
have a very solid performance
against these. guys.”

Van Pelt vividly remembers that
emotional game; there waS~the
bench-clearing brawl and the

  

 

 

   Pp

 

timeout that head coach Paul‘
Hackett called with the clock
-winding down to -make his
Panthers remember that moment.
“Temple came in here and took
the game from us. They really
rained on‘ our parade,” he‘ recalled.
Van Pelt’s performance against
Temple was one of the rare times
in his career that he haSn’t
sparkled. '
Last season he became only
the second quarterback’ in Pitt
history (the first was Dan Marino)

to pass for over 2,000 yards in -~ 8

consecutive seasons, finishing
with 2,427 yards. He is currently

third on Pitt’s career-passing,

yardage list with 5,785 and ranks
fourth in Pitt’s career-total offense

inept Tommy Hodson. Check out Hodson’s
nasty line from last Sunday: 12 for 26, with
95 yards and two interceptions.

You would think that he was facing the
Giants or Chiefs._No, he was facing the
Browns.

This is a team that has scored only 16
points and generated 549 yards in their
first two ballgames.

The only hope New England has is to
give the ball to rookie Leonard Russell,
and let him pound away at the interior of
Pittsburgh’s front.

That won’t last very“ long. The Steelers
are just too physical and will easily
dominate the line of scrimmage.

On offense look for Pittsburgh to mix
it up.

The Patriots defense is actually very
respectable and does not have any glaring
deﬁciencies. However the Bills can attest
to the damage that Barry Foster will do.

Foster thought he was back atArkansas
running through Rice the way he chewed
up Buffalo, with 121 yards on only 9
carries. ‘

Bubby Brister should be encouraged
by the fact that even Bernie Kosar had a
good day against New England, so he may
actually have a good day as well.

There’s no point in beating around the

bush. The Steelers will win. They’ll win

big.

The only drama in this game will be
whether or not New England eclipses the
massive total of 8 first downs that they

produced against the Brownies. We

wouldn’t bet on that. Take Pittsburgh -

Notre Dame, Michigan
face off in Ann Arbor

By Brian Berger

and Rob Pugliese
T be Pitt News

The School Boys 11 continued
their assault on college ball as we
posted a 2-1 mark (3-1 including
the mandatory Pitt contest) to up
our record to a sweet 5-1 on the
season. The Big Blue of Michigan
let us down, /but we’re comin’
right back with the Wolverines
(Elvis is still in the house) as well
as SEC powerhouses and the
suddenly proud Panthers. Kick
‘em in the grill, Rob.

Notre Dame (1-0) at (-3 1/2)
Michigan (1-0), 3:30 p.m.
Saturday, ABC.

The fourth-ranked Wolverines
have endured four consecutive

losses to Lou Holtz and his
leprechauns. The frustration
reached new heights last year in
South Bend, when Jon Vaughn
and Michigan dominated for three
quarters, only to let their 24-14
lead slip away when the Irish
scored the winning touchdown

3 in the final two minutes for a 28-

24 victory. The Wolverines were
clearly the better team, but
somehow Notre Dame escaped.
This time will be different.

Both clubs warmed up for this
battle with sloppy wins on
Saturday. Michigan led Boston
College by only a point with
eight minutes remaining in the
game before the combination of
Elvis Grbac and Desmond

year ago, with 845 yards and a
5.7 average per carry. Matthews
lost his top three wideouts from
last season, but T re Everett and
Harrison Houston will step right
in. Houston caught three
touchdowns against San Jose
State. The offensive line is solid
and experienced.

The Gator defense is still
adjusting to the departure of
defensive end Huey Richardson
and cornerback Richard Fain to
the NFL, but there is more than
enough talent to compensate.
Six starters return, including all-
conference linebackers Brad
Culpepper and Tim Paulk and
All—American free safety Will
White.

Gene Stallings survived his first
year at Alabama ‘despite going
“only” 7-4. The 16th—ranked Tide
‘is bolstered by the return of all-
conference tailback Siran Stacy,
who ran for 1,079 yards and 17
touchdowns in ’89 but missed
the entire ’90 season afterinjuring
his knee in the opener with
Southern Mississippi. Stacy ran
for 95 yards and a touchdown,
while also throwing a touchdown

pass to lead the Tide in a 41-3
ﬂattening of Temple. His running
mate is fullback Kevin Turner.
Their return combined with
talented sophomore Tarant Lynch
should give ‘Bama a potent
ground assault. Quick! Name
Alabama’s quarterback. That’s
what we thought; he’s going to
have a hard time against Florida’s
secondary. Senior Danny
Woodson won the job but is
totally unproven. His running
ability is his best asset, as
evidenced by an 85-yard
touchdown run last week. Flanker
Prince Wimbley, who also missed
nine games with an injury last
year, and split end Craig
Sanderson lead a deep receiving
corps. Alabama riddled the
Temple defense for 481 yards in
total offense at week ago. But if
this squad has any title hopes,‘
they rest on the defense.

It might be surprising to know
that Alabama led the SEC in
defense last year, even to Florida

field general Matthews, who,

recently said, “I think they had a
good defense last year. ” Yes, they
did, Shane. Seven starters return

corps returns, featuring all-

Three-fourths of the secondary
~that allowed a completion rate of
only 45.6 percent and only five
TD passes last year returns.
Our knowledge here tells us
that Florida is comin’ out really
fired up and already is eyeing the
Sugar. Matthews and the Gators
will fly by air, while Stacy and the
Tide will grind it out. Expect a
close ballgame for the first half,
but as the game wears on, Florida
will dismantle ‘Bama in a fashion

similar to the way that they
spanked Auburn last year. Florida
was 4-1-1 versus the spread as a
home favorite last year. The

Gators won at ‘Bama in a rugged,

17-13 ballgame last year. It won’t
be quite as close this time out
‘cause Shane knows the Tide
defense. Knows how to exploit,
that is. Take Florida -7.

Indianapolis Colts (0-2) at (-7

’ 1/2) L. A. Raiders (1-1).

We picked on the Colts last
week, and we love ‘em so much

9‘that we’re back to harass them
.. some -more.

I ‘ Like we told you last week,
anyone who loses to New

8‘ England at home simply loses all

respect."
, Surprisingly though, the

» Indianapolis defense is still

baffling us experts.
Through two weeks of play

 the Colts lead the AFC in total
defense and rank third in the

entire league.

They held Dan Marino and
Miami to a 3-3 deadlock for a half
before realizing who they were

'8 If in the second half and falling 17-

6. But Marino only threw for 147
yards, so could this defense be
for real?

Eric Dickerson has yet to
impress this year. Sorry, but 3.8
yards per carry for a man this
talented will not cut it.

He should have ripped the
Miami defense, but 60 yards on
19 carries was all that Dickerson
could manage. This will not be
his big breakout week, we’re
afraid.

The Raiders snuffed Gaston
Green and the Denver running
game to the tune of 33 yards on
19 carries in their 16-13 victory
over the Broncos.

Raider fans saw the Roger

Craig of old last week, except.

that he was running in their silver
and black rather than the red and
gold of the ’49ers.

Craig racked up 99 yards in
his first start as a Raider, ﬁlling in
for the injured Marcus Allen. Craig
should have another big week,
taking some of the heat off Jay
Schroeder and opening up that
Colt defense.

Look for a low—scoring game
with field position being a factor.

The guess here is that Greg
Townsend, Ronnie Lott and the
headhunting Raider defense will
eliminate Dickerson from
anything effective, forcing Jeff
George to air it out.

Indy’s defensewill not have
similar success against Craig. Look
for Schroeder to have time and
Willie Gault to have a big day.

If that’s not enough reason to
take the Raiders, well, our
perspective editor is a Raider fan,

and she can’t wait until they get

Bo and the Rocket in the same
backfield.
It won’t be a pretty game, but

L.A. follows owner Al Davis’
slogan: “Just win, baby.” Take Los
Angeles -7 1/2.

(- 8) Buffalo Bills (2-0) at New
York Jets (1-1).

After watchingJirn Kelly torch
Pittsburgh for 365 yards and 6
touchdown passes in the Bills’
52-34 victory on Sunday, we are
convinced that the Bills’ defensive
end Bruce Smith can take a few
extra weeks to heal his injury
while Kelly, Andre‘ Reed,
Thurman Thomas and the rest of
the offense continue their tirade
on NFL defenses.

Buffalo has racked u p 87 points
and 1,119 yards in two weeks
and Bruce Coslet’sJets don’t ﬁgure
to stopthis bumrush.

New York should have success
running the ball against that
injured Buffalo front, but they
will suffer the same fate as the
Steelers. . 8

and theJets could control the ball
and stay in the game for a half or
so, but then Kelly’s blitzkrieg will
do serious damage.

Jersey and New York City
should get ready to evacuate
‘cause the entire area around the
Meadowlands will be radioactive
after the Buffalo “O” triggers a
nuclear meltdown.

No more analysis necessary.
We, like the Bills. The only
question is whether receiver Don
Beebe was a one-week wonder
or a real Beebe gun. Take
Buffalo -8.

(-2) Miami Dolphins (1-1) at
Detroit Lions (1-1).

Don Shula’s crew came
through for us last week, and
now they face a puzzling .Detroit
club that looked to be knee deep
in turmoil a week ago but now
appears alive and well.

Marino only went 14-25 for
147 yards with one touchdown
and one ‘interception againstithe
Colts, buttailback Mark Higgs
ripped it up again.

The - 5-foot, 7-inch Higgs
rushed for 111 yards on 27 carries
to make some doubters take a
second look. Through two games
he has 257 yards on 57 carries,
second only to Thurman Thomas.

If Higgs has other games like
those, injured tailback Sammie
Smith may have lost his job for
more than a few weeks.

In the Motor City, fans and
players alike were calling for
Coach Wayne Fontes’ “Silver
Stretch” offense to be taken to the
used-car graveyard after
Washington shellacked the Lions
45-0 in Week 1.

. But a little man named Barry ‘
' Sanders goes a long way towards

curing a sick offense. Sanders
returned from an injury against
Green Bay to help the Lions to a
23-14 win over the Green Bay
Packers.

Sanders accounted for only
42 yards rushing, but his mere
presence took all of the pressure
from the shoulders of QB Rodney
Peete and forced Packer
defenders to divert their attention
from receiver Robert Clark.

Peete completed a career-
high 25 passes in 38 attempts for
271 yards and a touchdown,
finally looking like the field
general the Lions envisioned.
Clark caught\10 of those passes
for 143 yards.

The problem for Detroit now
is the defense. The two top Lion
pass rushers, linebacker Mike
Cofer and defensive tackle Jerry
Ball are banged up,- and this
secondary is not ready to contend
with Marino and his Marks
Brothers. ‘

Thisshould be a wild shoot-
out, with ESPN devoting 20
minutes of “NFL Primetime’? to
the battle between Marino and
Sanders.

The Lions better gas up the
engines because Miami’s turbos
are set for cruise control in the
Silverdome.

The Dolphins we/re 5-0 against
the spread as a road favorite last
season, and hey, we already took
one road favorite, so why — not
two? Take Miami -2.

Continucdfrom page 5

list with 5,591 yards. He has a
career—completion percentage of
.569 and holds the Pitt record for
completions in a game, with 37
versus Notre Dame last season.
As a first—year player he broke
Dan Marino’s single—season
record for passing yardage with
2,881 yards, and he already owns
more 300—yard passing games
(five) than any other quarterback
in Pitt history.

This year Van Pelt is just taking
care of business.

The junior from San Antonio,
Texas, entered the '91 campaign
as one of the premier signal-
callers in the nation and a
legitimate All-American
candidate, according to every
major publication in the country.
He has performed very
impressively while leading Pitt to
two big wins. Van Pelt has
completed 35 of 50 passes for 377
yards and four touchdowns, with
only one interception. What is
most impressive about his 66-

percent completion rate is that he

hasspread his passes out among
nine different receivers.

Van Pelt has started 25 games
for the Panthers, and his
experience, knowledge of
Hackett’s offense and poise under
pressure are three of his strongest
assets. He feels much more
comfortable with this offense than
he has at any time in his career.

“He knows the offense inside
and out. He reads defenses very
well [and] watches a lot of films.

Please
Note...

Kickoff Time
for Saturday's

Game vs. the
Temple Owls

He makes things a lot easier for
us," said tight end Dave Moore.
“In certain situations he'll let us
know exactly what's coming. He’s
taken the role of leader very well
and doesn't have any problem
keeping everyone in line.”
Hackett feels that the key to
Pitt’s first two victories has been
their ability to play as a team. Van
Pelt believes that the Panthers
are playing together as a team
more effectively than at any other
time since he has been at Pitt.
“We’re complementing each
other offensively and defensively
very well right now,” he said.
“Team play has put us in such
good position offensively.”
_The offense has looked to
sustain long drives a_nd control
the football in an effort to let the
defense catch its breath. The
defense does its part by creating
turnovers and setting up great
field position for the offense.
_“I think the defense might have
scored more points than we have,"

Van Pelt joked.

Pitt’s offensive production has
definitely been a team effort, and
consistency has been a major
factor in its resurgence. Hackett
has been pleased with the
offensive mix between the run
and the pass. Van Pelt credited
the offensive line’ with superb
play thus far.

“The line has been gashing
holes for the running backs, and
I haven’t been touched or sacked
yet,” Van Pelt said. “I don't expect
to be sacked more than a couple
times all season.”

He quickly praised the Panthers’
young receiving corps for their
preparation and said that the
receivers have done a tremendous
job thus far.

“They came in untested. They’re
catching everything and making
huge plays when we need it.
Things can only get betterfor
them from here on,” Van Pelt
said.

with a stern challenge. The Owls

_return seven starters from the

defensive unit that troubled Pitt a
year ago. The secondary is very
experienced, with three returning
starters, including free safety Tony
Schmitz, who intercepted Van
Pelt twice last year. Coach Jerry
Berndt feels he has an outstanding
linebacking corps. Van Pelt said
that the Temple secondary is one
of the best Pitt will face this year,
featuring many different schemes
and a good nickel package. He
praised the Owl linebackers,
particularly seniors Santo
Stephens (6—feet, 4—inches, 232-
pounds) and James Harris (6-
feet, 8—inches, 267—pounds).
“Santo Stephens is a great
player. Harris is the drop backer;
he has long arms, a Renaldo
Turnbull-type,” Van Pelt said.
“Temple is not the Temple of

the past. They have a lot of talent
on that team,” he added.

Van Pelt said that despite all of 

the off-season problems, the

Panthers never lost confidence in ’ 

themselves and continued to
believe in’ each other. Hackett

stressed that the Panthers must ' 
recognize that they have to play 

one game at a time. Van Pelt and ;

his teammates realize the
importance of Saturday’s Big East
test.

after being 2-0, and we wound

“We were on a roll last year 

up 3-7-1,” he said. “I know it’s a f :7

cliche, but we’re taking them one
week at a time. This year is so

much more low-key. Everybody’sL A,

taking care- of business.”
“We’re not going to try and
avenge anything, just stay on the

same preparation level,” Van Pelt I,

said.

spot has been an area of concern
with underachieving Shawn Wills
and Kevin Williams. The entire
offensive line returns and looks
to be a major area of strength, led
by senior guard Scott Spalding.
On defense the Bruins allowed
30.8 points a game last year. Not
‘ good. There is reason to believe

4 that they should improve,

particularly because three starters
return to the secon'dary that held

who has been compared to former

 

Bruin greats Kenny Easley and
Don Rogers. Darby is joined by
the fine cornerback tandem of
Dion Lambert and Carlton Gray,
a duo that has been together for
two full seasons already.
However the front seven is
loaded with question marks. Ex-
Panther Mike Chalenski is the
leader of the line from his end

Maddox and feel that he deserves

is too much for him. UCLA will
have big problems running the
football on this Tennessee front,
setting up a great deal of third-

Smith, Kacy Rodgers, Hardy and «

The Vol secondary is more than
capable of staying with Moore

College

Continued from page 14
against the soft Bruins’ underbelly.
The Carl Pickens Factor won’t
even rise to the forefront until the
Bruins begin to tire. Basically the
Vols will take whatever the Bruins
give them. Unfortunately Maddox
is going to be one bruised Bruin,
and he’ll be seeing so much
orange he’ll probably think he’s
on a Sunkist farm. In our pick of
the week, Take Tennessee -7.

Now that we've established that
the Florida-Tennessee showdown
on October 12 is still going to be
the real deal,and that: Ann Arbor
will be singing “Hail To The
Victors,” let’s clear off the table

and have some dessert.

Temple (0-1) at (-17) Pitt (2-0).

Panther pride is back. The
Panthers impressed the nation
with their 35-14 beating of
Southern Miss last week and as a
result are now ranked 24th in the
latest polls. Temple opened up at
Legion Field in Alabama with a
painful 41-3 loss.

This week’s clash will be the
first-ever Big East football game
at Pitt Stadium, another reason to
show up, as if Pitt's 2-0 mark
wasn’t enough. '

Cornerback Steve Israel once
again sparked Pitt with an 81-
yard interception return and a 35-

yard fumble return for
touchdowns while garnering Big
East Defensive Player of the Week.
Keith Hamilton dominated the
Golden Eagles with six tackles,
two sacks and a deﬂected pass.
On offense Alex Van Pelt and
Chris Bouyer connected on
touchdown strikes of 15 and 20
yards.

T emple’s offense sputtered at
Alabama, so senior Trent
Thompson, will start at
quarterback instead of Anthony
Richardson.

Temple has quality running

' backs in Scott McNair, Conrad

Swanson’ and Leon Brown.

Offense

Continued from page 3
and a touchdown. Richardson
won the starting nod this fall,
only to open the season with a 3
for 17 performance against
Alabama, a 41-3 Tide victory. As
a result backup Trent Thompson,
who doubles as the nation’s top
punter, will get the start Saturday.

“The quarterback change is a
little bit surprising, considering
Richardson's impact last year,"
said Pitt head coach Paul Hackett
“Now, in Thompson,_ we're
dealing with the unknown."

No matter who the quarterback
is, the Temple offense revolves

around the running backs. In last-

year’s game, fullback Conrad
Swanson scored three
touchdowns, and tailback Scott

McNair added 77 yards. Both -

return to anchor the backfield,

_ along with Leon Brown.

“With Temple, it’s definitely
the nmning game,” Hackett said.
“The combination of Swanson’s
power and Brown's speed is
excellent.”

McNair led the team in rushing
last year with 623 yards, while
Brown added 573.Injuries to the
backfield aren't a death blow
because the Owls go at least two
deep at both positions without
losing much. '

The passing game is decent no

A matter who throws the ball,

although Temple lost starting
wideout Rob Graf to a broken left
collarbone last week. “That’s a
real blow to their passing game,”
Hackett said. “because Graf is an
excellent possession receiver.”

Without Graf the focus shifts to
ﬂanker Leslie Shepard, who
caught only three passes last year
and none in the opener at
Alabama. Shepard, a transfer from
Miami, possesses good speed but
lacks experience. He also has
good open-field ability, as he is
the primary kick returner.

The offensive line is solid but
suffered some breakdowns last
week. Seniors Dennis McCabe
and Brian Krulikowski are the
leaders of this group, but both
tackles are sophomores. Tight
end was expected to be a strength,
but George Deveney, the leading

returning receiver, is suffering

from a strained hamstring.
Deveney did not play last week
and remains questionable for this
week’s game.

Still, a change at quarterback
likely will affect this team. And

.while it may not change Pitt's

defensive plans, it is a surprise to

' at least one player, Steve Israel.

L.-. ..

“It really is surprising. I really

.:.-.4 u _:rurLS1.e

haven’t looked at any film of
[Thompson]. But it seems strange
to me, because Thompson is the
nation’s best punter (averaging

almost 50 yards a kick), and to _

have something happen to him;
they would lose two positions,”
said Israel.

Swanson scored three times
against the Panthers in T emple’s
28-18 beating of Pitt last season.
Starting tight end George Devaney
is questionable due to a strained
hamstring.

On defense the Owls feature
an experienced secondary and
an outstanding corps of
linebackers. Temple held Van
Pelt to 12-25 for 195 yards and
three interceptions last season
and returns seven defensive
starters.

With 15 seniors starting, expect
the Owls to be fired up. The
problem for Temple is that Pitt
will be fired up, too. The Panthers

are focused and determined to 

get yet another payback for last

season. Look fora close game in . 
the first half, but the Panther 
defense will dominate as the  

game progresses, setting up some
easy scores. , «
