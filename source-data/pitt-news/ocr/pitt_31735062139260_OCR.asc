THE PITT" WEEKLY ‘

H‘ ‘DR. GALPIN MAKES

&

ADDRESS TO Y. M. C. A.

~'.Rev. Dr. Frederick Tower Galpin,
pastor of the First Baptist‘ Qhurch,

'who has several times expected to

speak before the association, but has
each time been prevented by unfore-
seefi circumstances, addressed the Y.
M. C. A. meeting last Monday morn-
ing in Thaw Hall chapel. Dr. Galpin
is a man of attractive personality and

.persuasive speech, and his talk was

 of the Christian life.

one of rare merit and inspiration.

E‘ Taking his cue from a quaint quo-
tation, in which the ideal man is de-
scribed as “scholar, citizen and saint,”
he treated these three heads in turn.
“True culture,” he said, “necessitates
the cultivation of all the senses_.
beyvondrthe ﬁve purely physical senses

- there is a sixth, or spiritual, sense, a

certainty of and receptiveness to God,
which must be cultivated as carefully
as the ot_hers. '
“As a‘ citizen, a,man‘must assume
anew social responsibility. There are
loafers in every department of life,
but nowhere so markedly as in the
popular attitude toward the state. It
is the duty of every citizen not mere-
ly to sit in,,the grandstand, but to
out and play the game. .
“A saint is merely a man of lcyalty.
To grow in constancy is the essence
The root of

"constancy is faith, and faith ca. only

acter of our own personality."

LANGLEY DAY ' CELEBRATED

 

Tuesday, May 6th, was‘ celebrated
as Langley Day in honor of Prof.
Samuel Picrpont Langley, for 20
year'sian instructor in our University.
A memorial tablet in bronze was un-
veiled in the vestibule of the Smith-
sonian Institution, of which he was a

former secretary. The inscription
reads: ‘ *
Samuel Pierpont Langley
~ l834——l906
Secretary of the Smithsonian

Institution
.1887—1906

Discovered the relations of ‘speed and
. ..angle»of surface when moving

‘P i in the air. ‘
And the words of Langley himself:
“I have brought to a close the por-
tion of the work which seemed to be
specially mine, the demonstration of
the practicability of mechanical ﬂight.
iThe universal highway overhead is
soon to be opened."

Prof. Langley worked for 20 years
in the University of Pittsburgh and
its observatory and later in the
Smithsonian Institute, studying me-
chanical ﬂight. With bird, balloon,
kite and other devices he observed
and tested he effects of the atmos-
phere, its ertiies, resistances and
?conditions. This work resulted in
those underlying, scientiﬁc principles
gwhich were Langley’s own, unique
{contribution to the world. They are
jthe foundation on which the whole
ifabric of aviation is building to-day.
{The most interesting part of all is,
jthat they were discovered right here
iin our own unive sity, with the ﬁnan-
lclal support an. b_ro_ad intellectual
gsympathy of Mr. William Thaw. It
1,15, therefore. with pride that we see
lthis recognition of one who was so
ic_Io.sely~connected .with this institu-
tion. .

JOURNALISM. CONFER~E’NCE

The conference of Student Editors
this afternodn and to—niorrow morn-
ing, with speeches this -evening by
two of.the foremost authorities on
journalism in the country, is the first
convention of its kind ever held at
‘Pitt. Not only is it an original idea
here but is one of the ﬁrst of its kind
in the country. . ‘

Mr. Don C. Seitz, manager of The
New York World, is a man who is
probably better acquainted with the
actual managing of a great newspaper
than any other person in the United
States, while‘ Talcott Williams, whom
we all remember in his speech at our
last commencement exercises, is the
one newspaper genius. of America.
The speeches of these authorities will
be well worth hearing, whether
directly interested in journalism work
or not. I ‘

The afternoon and morning sessions
promise to bring forth many new fea-
tures of public interest, for when ﬁfty
student representatives of various col-
leges. and schools get their heads to-
» in journalistic discussions
progress is sure to follow. The pub-

is to be‘ taken up and discussed from
every ‘standpoint, both on the editorial

and business sides.

This co_nference will be of great
value to the profession of j0l.1l‘1_‘1allSn1

managers along the true newspaper
principles. ‘ Second, it will assist in
raising‘ the standard of the student
papers. ' ‘

it is to ‘be hoped that other con-
ferences may follow this one and that
a conference be the culmination of
every student newspaper year. By this
means the college and school journals
and papers can be raised to the stand-

tain. . k i

T. R. Williams,_ instructor in jour-
nalismand managing editor of The
Pittsburgh Pres's,, deserves_ much

. praise for originating and carryiing

out the plan of the conference, and
L. G..Boggs for his unt,,iring.assist-
ance to Mr. Williams. ’ , '

 

, COMPULSORY ASSEMBLY

The studentshave suddenly awakeii—
ed to the fact that the faculty intends
to enforce the new compulsory attend-
ance‘ rule for theweekly students‘ as-
sembly. Therule was put into effect
two weeks ago with the members of
the student senate acting as moni-
tors. The - senators havse

-' pledged to ‘ keep accurate _ reports
and all students who« absent
themselves from an . assembly will

be reported. Already
of suspensions have been

a a number
de in the

out presenting a‘ satisfactory excuse
to their respective deans.- It is very
gratifying to see the entire student
body present at the assemblies. At-
tendance is requirediin other colleges
and universities, so‘ why not here? To
get the entire student body together
at least once a week is a means‘ of
building up school spirit. In union
there is strength and this is the thing
we need; strength through our devo-
tion and loyalty to “Old Uni.” '

,' ‘_ .»V_Pitt opened her _home season last
Tuesday by defeating Bethany Col-

lege in a ‘listless and one-sided exhibi-
tion of baseball. The only features of
the game were the_heavy hitting of
the Pitt team, the pitching of Haren-
ski and a. catch by Johnny _Baker of a
foul ﬂy. - The ﬁrst two innings of the

- game were productive of a little bit of

bagball—-at least no person scored
during that time and many thought
‘that the game would be a close one—
but after that itfwas a questionaof how
many runs Pitt would make before
the-players became too tired to chase

' around. the "bases any longer. The

ﬁnal countof the slaughter was 14-0.
Hai-enskiﬁwas selected by Coach

Edmundson ‘to take the measure of

the Bethany men, who had defeated

some of the best teams in this part of

the country, and the manner in which

’ “Joe” took the measure of the visitors

_was highly pleasing to all parties con-

'cerned, except the Bethany players.

Harenski had all the smoke of a Wal-
ter Johnson and an assortment of
benders that made the visitors stand
on their heads, so to speak. Backed

 up by brilliant ﬁelding and hard.hit-

ting on the part of the Pitt players,
Harenski had everything his own
.way. The Bethany team had no more
chance to get a ‘run over the plate

'1 than Dr. Linhart-has of making the

varsity, and we consider. this a rather
slim possibility. , ~

DUAL MEET WITH ii. & J. _
AT WASHINGTON SATURDAY

Records will be broken to—mori'ow
when 15 picked Pitt athletes meet W.
& J. in the ﬁrst duel meet of the sea-
son at Washington, Pa. The men are
in the best of shape and it is expected
"that they will give as good an account
of themselves as they did last Satur-
day. The W. & J. men have been
training faithfully under Physical Di-
rector Kirchner, and will do their best
to defeat Pitt in the ﬁrst meet for
the Moreland bronze trophy.

Last year the Gold and Blue had
little trouble vanquishing the VVaIh-
ingtonians, but from reports. the task
will be considerably harder this year.

Much enthusiasm has been stirred
up in both schools over the event, and
a large crowd of Pitt rooters will ac-
company the team to Washington.

that Tuxedo does. ” '

* THE PITT WEEKLY ‘

Hit-Makers

UN DRE D8 of the snappiest ballplayers

in the country——the clean-cut athletes
who provide Americans with their greatest
outdoor relaxation——are cheerfully endorsing
Tuxedo. This is the kind of endorsement
that carries ‘a convincing, punch.

These men have to keep “trained to the
minute”. all the time. The game-——even the
pennant——may depend on. -a single moment’s
play. They cannot afford to take chances
in their training. ‘ .

So when th‘eysmoke,they smoke Tuxedo.

They know Tuxedo is a‘ mild, pure tobacco,

full of energizing qualities. It can be smoked all

' day with pleasure. It will not bite the tongue; it burns

freely and smoothly, giving a cool, sweet smoke.

 

The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette

is ina class by itself. It has many_imitators———but
in the pipe it has no equal. 1 It is made of the best
selected Burley tobacco, the ﬁnest that Kentucky
grows, ripened, cured and aged until it has reached

. the tip-top of mildness, mellowness and sweetness.

Thenit is treated by the original “Tuxedo proc-
ess”- which takes out all the sting so it cannot pois-
sibly bite———eVen if you should smoke it all day long.

You simply cannot buy:better tobacco any-
where; and if you will try Tuxedo today, you will
see why these men are so fond of it.

YOU CAN BUY TUXEDO EVERYWHERE

 

 

JIMMY ARCHER ’

Jimmy Archer, of the Chicago Cubs,
well-known catcher and “.300” hitter, says:

“Tuxedo is my idea of a good smoke

‘ in every u)ay——coolness, mildness, purity.

Tuxedo is a winner. "
