NSABP project to resume recruiting

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project received permission to resume
recruiting patients for the Breast Cancer
Prevention Trial and treatment trials for breast
cancer at selected sites next week.

“We are hoping that this will begin a
week from today, May 31,” said Dr. Ronald
Herberman, interim director of the federally
funded NSABP, after the project received
permission from the National Cancer Institute.

The NCI requested in March that no more
patients be admitted to the study because of fal-
siﬁed data from a Canadian investigator at St.
Luc’s Hospital in Montreal, and because
of concerns about data management and audit-
ing procedures at the project’s headquarters at
Pitt.

According to Dr. Bruce Chabner, director of
the NCI Division of Cancer Treatment, the list
of selected facilities to begin recruiting is still
under negotiation, but will be restricted to insti-
tutions that have had satisfactory audits within
the past three years.

“The resumption of patient accrual is an
important step forward to both NCI and the
NSABP,” Chabner said.

Herberman said the NSABP moved as rapid-
ly as it could to get plans in place so the project
could once again begin recruiting patients. The
series of changes include a detailed plan to the
NCI which suggests having an audit system on
the clinical studies to assure both the partici-
pants and the public—at-large of the validity of
the previous studies.

Herberman said another change has been to
involve the trial participants themselves in the

Hundreds
celebrate
legacy of
Malcolm X

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Despite Malcolm X’s assas-
sination 29 years ago, hun-
dreds of people met on
Saturday to celebrate his lega-
cy.

“Before his death, Malcolm
had emerged as the interna-
tional spokesman for the pro-
gressive and liberation forces
of the world because of his
ability to break down and
articulate [the concerns of
various groups],” Muhammed
Ahmad, an associate of
Malcolm X, said. “He became
a citizen of the world.”

Ahmad, was the keynote
speaker at the fifth annual
National Malcolm X Holiday
Celebration held in David
Lawrence Hall Auditorium.

Vending tables with cloth-
ing, books and various other
cultural items crowded the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of David Lawrence

while ceremonies. speakers-
and dancers educated the ‘

audience about the life of
Malcolm X.

The festivities, hosted by
Pitt’s Africana Studies depart-
ment and the Malcolm X
Holiday Commission, attract-
ed more than 600 people.

“This [event] is important
because when we have an
international leader who had
the foresight to develop
answers a long time ago to
today’s problems, we should
learn from him,” Jim
Crawford Sr., a local member
of the audience, said.

Oakland residents discuss relationship with Pitt

university.

By Sam Gresock

- Graphics Assistant

In an effort to suggest ways
to increase cooperation
between Pitt and the Oakland
community, the Oakland
Neighborhood Alliance held
its third public forum
Saturday.

Approximately 70 Oakland
residents attended the open
meeting, held at the Pittsburgh
Blind Association building in
North Oakland.

Oakland residents filled out
surveys and had the opportu-
nity to vote on issues such as

local job opportunities, public
safety, community improve-
ment, zoning and the involve-
ment of residents in Pitt’s
expansion decisions during an
informal balloting session.

The results of the survey
will be used in future discus-
sions with Pitt regarding the
university’s Master Space Plan
for expansion and develop-
ment.

Oakland resident Theodore
Ley, a member of the all-vol-
unteer ONA, said he hopes
Pitt’s expansion plans are
designed to benefit the entire
neighborhood as well as the

“The so-called Master Plan
is a master plan for Pitt, but it
isn’t necessarily a master plan
for Oakland,” Ley said after
the meeting. “They need to
include all residents as far as
how they’ll be impacted by
this Master Plan.”

Ley has lived in Oakland for
about 11 years. In that time, he
said he has seen an “adversari-
al” relationship between Pitt
and Oakland residents due in
part to what he calls a lack of
communication.

“They need to ﬁnd sites [for
expansion], but how do they

get our input?,” Ley said. “I
haven’t received any public
information saying ‘this is
what we’d like to see hap-
pen.”’

Oakland resident and ONA
chair Marshall Goodwin said
he hopes the public forums
can shed some light on the
struggle between Pitt and the
neighborhood.

Goodwin said the meetings
help bring the community
together so residents can share
common concerns.

“Oakland is a microcosm of
everything in the city  we’ve

News In Brief...

International

A Haiti — Shots were ﬁred at a

ship this weekend and Monday
night by U.S. Navy ships
enforcing the international
embargo against Haiti.

The U.S. frigate Antrin
reportedly ﬁred ten 50-"caliber
shots at the Panamanian-
flagged Leonese on Monday
and planned to board it later
yesterday, according to
Lieutenant Colonel Stephanie
Hoehme. The U.S. frigate
Fiteh ﬁred warning shots over
the weekend at the Bahamian
ship Sea Search, Hoehme said,
but it continued on and the
U.S. ship stopped ﬁring when
Sea Search got so close to the
shore that civilians might be
hurt. The United Nations-
approved embargo took effect
early Sunday. —— Reuters

Jerusalem — Palestine
Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat issued an order
cancelling laws enforced by
Israel during its 27-year occu-
pation of the West Bank town
of Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
But Israel said Arafat couldn’t
change the law without Israeli
approval. Arafat’s announce-
ment was published in two

Jerusalem-based Palestinian r

newspapers, and instructed
civilian and religious courts in

  leas

Gaza and Jericho to operate
under laws that existed in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip
before Israel occupied the ter-

Washington, D.C. — Denny’s
Restaurants has agreed to pay
$45 million in damages to
avoid charges that it discrimi-
nated against African-
American customers in viola-
tion of federal civil rights
laws. The restaurant chain,
owned by Flag Star, one of the
largest food-service firms in
the country, has plans to
launch a nationwide program
to prevent further discrimina-
tion. Denny’s had been the tar-

.get of two lawsuits filed last
year in Baltimore and San
Jose, Calif. federal courts. The
allegations state that Denny’s
failed to serve African
Americans or required them to
pay a cover charge and pay
before the meals were served.
The settlement resolves both
lawsuits. — Reuters

Salameh rented the van

With the exception of the resi-

South Africa as well as prob-
lems like inner-city violence
and unemployment. These
things are predictable in a
society where people aren’t
listened to because they are
African-American,” Crawford
said.

Currently a professor of
political science at
Wilberforce University,
Ahmad worked with X on
several projects.

Ahmad was also a member
of the African-American
grass—roots organization
Revolutionary Action
Movement and the New York
Black Panther Party, which
preceded the Black Panther
Party for Self-Defense.

Ahmad’s speech traced
Malcolm X’s life from child-
hood and the influences which
contributed to his rise as a pro-

. gressive leader.

“Of course, it started with
his negative reaction to racism
as a child,” Ahmad said.

He said Malcolm X became
the first highly visible part of a
radical African-American
movement which had been
active for a long time. ’

“Malcolm said history is the
basis of all research,” Ahmad
said. “The reason we must
confront certain situations is
because the situation has not

iresuay, iviay A3, 177‘!

been resolved by the last gen-
eration.

"Malcolm said we must
investigate why the last gener-
ation could not resolve the
problem. When we look at
this, we might find out what
we need to do now to solve the
problem,” Ahmad said.

According to Ahmad, it was
Malcolm X’s attempts to solve
other problems, in addition
to the liberation of African-
American people, which
resulted in surveillance by the
U.S. Government.

According to Ahmad,
Malcolm X wrote President
Truman a letter from prison
which warned against fighting
in Asia.

“From then on, he was
watched by the government,”
Ahmad said.

“[Malcolm X] initiated the
first prison hunger strike
in Massachusetts. As a result,
inmates were granted Muslim
dietary rights if they chose,”
Ahmad said. “He also protest-
ed Vietnam before 1960;
he was one of the first protest-
ers.”

Ahmad said one of Malcolm
X’s most valuable qualities
was his ability to bring
organizations together and
maintain a network, a legacy
of unity which he says
African Americans should not

forget.

The solemn Malcolm X
Unity ritual, which is held to
reaffirm commitment to
Africa, was one of the
evening’s highlights.

Several leaders of local
African-American organiza-
tions joined representatives of
African countries in “passing
the water” with a black, green
and red flag, a symbol of
Malcolm X, draped in the
background. The ritual was
conducted by Sheldon Ingram
of WTAE-TV.

“In spite of [European-
Americans’] cruel oppression,
we guaranteed the struggle and
our liberation,” Ingram said
before passing the water,
which symbolized Africa’s
people.

“We, the descendants of
Africa, must submerge our
religious, philosophical and
organizational differences and
join our efforts and resources
so we may have a world where
all Africans are free,” Ingram
said.

Earlier, local activist and
radio personality Rick Adams
opened the events by speaking
on the need for African unity.

“Malcolm X argued that cul-
ture is an indispensable
weapon in the freedom strug-
gle,” Adams said. “We need a

cultural revolution to reunite

in Africa.”

Adams also said Malcolm X
deserves a holiday in May
each year to celebrate his
birthday. On May 19 of this
year, he would have been 68. ~

“The founding principle for
Malcolm X Day must be
unity,” Adams said. “A cultur-
al unity created as a result of
self-determination can only
survive as a consequence of
African—American unity. The
inspiration for this unity must

‘ be Malcolm X.”

Lee Kiburi, chair of the
Malcolm X Holiday
Commission, said individuals
should celebrate the holiday
even if it is not sanctioned
by the United States govern-

ment.

“This is a self-determined
holiday. When the government
gives you a holiday, the

-government can give you the

day off,” Kiburi said. “In a
self-determined holiday, you
just take the day off to cele-
brate Malcolm.”

The program, which was
also sponsored by Pitt’s Kuntu
Writer’s Workshop, included
performances by various cul-
tural groups.

Poets Sage Berlin and Kelly
Parker were featured, along
with the dancing of the Norma
Jean Barnes Dancers.

The performance troupe
Glorious Rebirth also enter-
tained the audience with their
music. Touring rap artists,
Misfits in the Attic, performed
in the celebration’s finale.

got a little bit of everything
here,” Goodwin said after the
meeting.

“[The forums] are an excel-
lent way to bring all the fac-
tions of the community
together so we can all start
seeing how we’re all affected
by the same issues,” according
to Goodwin.

Goodwin said a current
major item of concern among
Oakland citizens is the con-
struction of Pitt’s new under-
graduate college of business
administration.

Several of Pitt’s building
proposals for the new school
involve acquiring land behind
the Katz Graduate School of
Business ,which is adjacent to
Schenley Park. ’

Goodwin said building on
park property would have
harmful effects on the com-
munity and those who use the
park.

“When the university starts
to look at [developing] park

property when they currently
have unutilized and underuti-
lized buildings, it definitely
becomes a threat,” according
to Goodwin.

No Pitt representatives
attended Saturday’s forum,
though Goodwin said Pitt
affiliates showed up at ONA’s

this year.

“We hope the information
from these meetings can be
used by [Pitt],’_’ Goodwin
said. “They have to listen to
what we have to say  they
have to start actively acting on
our concerns.”

Ley also said he hopes to
see active involvement by
the university in ‘ issues
affecting the neighborhood
and its citizens.

“They need to send repre-
sentatives to see what our
needs are  it would be in
their best interests to see
what’s going on,” Ley said.
“We’d be doing all their work
for them.”

empower the participants,
while also allowing the par-

NSABP will remain on pro-
bation for most of the can-
cer- treatment protocols
until there is a resolution of
problems dealing with moni-
toring, oversight, re-analysis
and reporting.

“There are still problems of
administration that are not
resolved,” Chabner said.
“NCI has not accepted the
NSABP restructuring plan
in its entirety, and therefore
NSABP will remain on
probation until a fully
acceptable plan is submit-
ted.”

At the time of the termina-
tion of recruitment, the NCI
also requested that Dr.
Bernard Fisher resignas
director of the project.

Herberman said the current
status of Fisher’s role in the
NSABP still has to be
worked out with the universi-
ty, the NCI and Fisher.

Cheap shot defeats purpose

The national gang summit meeting will be held in Pittsburgh
this weekend. Not surprisingly, some Pittsburghers have not
reacted positively to the news. Community leaders praise the
attempt to substitute peace for violence. Some city residents
however, suffer from a chronic case of NIMBY (Not In My Back
Yard).

Monday’s Tribune-Review ran an editorial cartoon on the gang
summit. A hotel bellboy lies shot on the ground. The desk atten-
dant asks an African-American gang member, who is holding a
smoking handgun, whether he prefers a smoking or non-smoking
room.

This cartoon is aimed at entertaining bigots.

It was a low blow against the gang summit and gang members
—— an artistic drive-by shooting.

The cartoon was counter-productive.

Many residents, including Pitt students and Oaklanders,
stay inside, afraid of the growing violence in our city, and
reminiscing of the old days when they felt safe walking
the streets at night. When the effort to initiate a change ap-
pears, however, it is met with mindless cheap shots, such as the
Tribune-Review ’s cartoon.

Rather than respond negatively to the gang summit hosted in
Pittsburgh, the city’s media, leaders and citizens should react
positively. to this effort to end violence, no matter who is
involved.

cram it down their-throats.

Americans should "patiently stand behind our democratic'lead—
ers and support the sanctions imposed on the Haitians. The

However, embargoes by their nature take time to show re-

up with yet another political embarrassment on its hands, remi-

State schoo|sjccin't account for funds

s the state’s financial
watchdog, my major
concern is accounting

for state-govemment spending.

Accountability in government’

programs: is increased with the
establishment of detailed goals,
objectives and spending guide-

-lines. Unfortunately, Pennsyl-

vania’s fiscal report card shows
a falling grade in the account-
ability of its funding of higher
education.

Pennsylvania’s state—related’
and state—aided institutions of
higher education have been
sheltered under the notion that
commonwealth citizens don’t
have the right to know

authority to audit expenditures
of state allocations for these
institutions. However, without
spending guidelines what is
there to audit? Through the
current allocation process,
spending the money is the only
criterion for an institution to
receive it. ’ V

In addition, my department
has the authority to disallow
expenditures made by those
institutions for purposes not
permitted by the non—preferred
appropriations acts. But, these
acts fail to detail the intended
purposes of the funding, mak-
ing it impossible to render

al mission of a school. These
spending examples highlight
how the lack of guidelines.
restrictions or prohibitions on
the use of non—preferred appro-
priations can lead to abuse.
You may be wondering why
these state—aided and state-

jrelated higher education insti-

tutions don’t disclose how they
spend state tax dollars. Many
institutions believe they are not
obliged to present their finan-
cial affairs to public scrutiny
because they are considered
“private.” However, because
they are authorized to receive

and spend state appropriations.

they have surrendered

their hard-earned tax “I believe our messa e to these their independent sta-

lishment of spending guide-
lines. _ .

This year the commonwealth
allocated more than $580 mil-
lion to four state—related and
nine state—aided institutions of
higher learning. This money
willbe spent without specific
state guidance, unlike the funds
appropriated to the 14 state-
owned universities which have
a unified accounting manual to
detail spending guidelines. The
majority of the $580 million
goes to the state—related univer-
sities: Penn State University,
the University of Pittsburgh,
Temple University, and
Lincoln University. Similar
state funding is also received
by the University of
Pennsylvania, _ Drexel
University, Hahnemann
University and other state-
aided private schools.

My department has the

‘ ability of funding to payer mOney.99
— Auditor General Barbara

judgement on the appropriate
use of money. _
This problem is intensified
because the bulk of these insti-
tutions’ state expenditures cur-
rently falls into a category
labeled “educational and gen-
eral expense.” On average, 84
percent of the dollars appropri-
ated to these institutions falls
into this catchall account. With
no guidelines, almost ‘anything

could be considered a general "

expense. University adminis-
trators can legally use state
funds for purposes which are
not related to educating our
students.

In fact, prior audits conduct-
ed by my department have doc-
umented spending for parties,
lavish retirement benefits, and
even a low-interest loan to an
employee. No average taxpay-
er would consider such spend-
ing as related to the education-

to avoid public exami-
nation of their spend-
ing practices, and pub-
lie when they want
taxpayer money. They should
no longer expect state money
to be appropriated with no
analysis of need, no guidelines
for spending, and no account-

‘ability.
In an effort to initiate reform, 5
—I recently suggested a three-

part plan a to the House
Education" Committee on
reforming the current appropri-
ation process and urge you, as
a state taxpayer, to support
a reform of the current spend-
ing process. You deserve
to know how your tax dollars
are used. You deserve to know
that state funding to institu-
tions of higher education will
be limited only to purposes
directly related to educating
students.

vania's auditor general, is a

Entertainment

sieamin trains

 

diner follows it. Especially

, Sterling (Monte Russell), the
ex-con looking for a job.
Russell’s lines are delivered a
little too fast to understand in
the beginning, but that passion
ignites the play later during the
black power scenes and the
seduction of Risa.

To close their 1993-94 sea-
son, Pittsburgh Public Theater
chose August Wilson’s Two
Trains Running as its designat-
ed hit, and unlike the Pirates
lately, it delivered.

Directed by Claude Purdy,
whose experience with

Wilson’s plays is evident, Two
Trains Running gives the audi-
ence a good view A of
Pittsburgh’s own Hill District
during the civil rights move-
ment circa 1969. Wilson lets
the characters -become the
story. The play moves, cooks

V and the audience laughs’ loud-

ly. Set in the diner of uptight,
upright owner Memphis, the
saucy dialogue is informal and
the audience is immediately

engaged. Charles Weldon—

plays Memphis, a diner owner
that must sell, who is trying to
get what he feels he deserves.

There is a search for truth in
the play; these characters
believe in prophets (Samuel)
and psychics, yet never disre-
gard fate. Memphis, even after
he was unjustly tried in the
racist South of his youth, still
believes in the legal system.
Risa slashes her legs up to
snag a man that is interested in
her for something other than
her physical beauty. And
Sterling,  well, he still
believes in love. ’

Two Trains Running is
Wilson’s latest play, and
has already won the New

York Drama Critics’ Circle
Award for its run
on Broadway. It’s running
at the Pittsburgh Public
Theaterthrough June 19.
Tickets are available by calling
321-9800.

The music and the set are
‘painstakingly accurate — from
the color of the kitchen paint
to the ketchup bottles —— and
add to the play as a whole.
Willis Burks II is admirable
as Wolf, the numbers runner.
Taking risks sums up much of
what the play is about,
whether it’s gambling, the law,

-Tara M Lmkatchy

or love. Holloway (Sala Udin),
West (Allie Woods, Jr.) and
Hambone (performed, not
exploited by, Ron L. Cox) give
the play a fullness and under-
standing that is Diner -esque.
Risa (Angel Brown) the
waitress moves with 72 rpm
speed, and every eye in that

*** Remember, the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival
begins its fifteenth season this

Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid
Collective Soul
Atlantic

What’s in a name? “Collective Soul” is almost
right  I was thinking that Collective Garbage
might be more appropriate; perhaps that’s too
harsh. Probably the most accurate name would be
Collective Cliche. This band borrows/steals dead
and boring rock ‘n’ roll junk and assembles it for,
you guessed it, a dull, lackluster album. What’s in
a name? Hints, Allegations, and Things Left
Unsaid? It’s hard to tell if this is supposed to be
clever, or maybe it’s an attempt for some Southern
mysticism —— they’re from Atlanta. The bottom
line is that it is a clumsy attempt to sell a soulless
band. ‘

Like a bad Blind Melon ripoff band, Collective
Soul has got that pretty-boy, long-hair, shop-at-the-
Gap-but-tear-holes-in-my-jeans-style. I think they
watch too much MTV. The first song, “Shine” is a
five-minute opus that cops everyone from School
of Fish, to Jesus Jones, to Pearl Jam, and, if they’re
hipper than I think, the. Kinks. The distorted gui-
tars start a jerky little riff that emulates the vocal
line of “Lola” and the lyrics are sort of breathy,
talky/singy like that Jesus Jones song “Right Here,
Right Now.” They ask for “a word  a sign” then
on the chorus beg, “Heaven let your light shine

down.” The guitars toss a few barre-chords around

an
rus. My favorite part of the song is before the cho-
rus when somebody in the their toughest, most
pronounced Eddie Vedder drawl says “Yeah” in
answer to the pre-chorus riff. I also enjoy the Billy
Corganesque guitar bust throughout the song.

As far as variety, Collective Soul included an
instrumental. Of course, you’d expect it to be some
sappy tune about some girl, and it is. “Pretty
Donna” doesn’t even showcase the musical
prowess of the band: a guest musician played key-
boards, and did the string arrangement. The song is
a pseudo-classical interlude that has nothing to do
with the rest of the album. I can picture a band
meeting: “Uh, I know we could use an extra song,

but it doesn’t seem to fit  Don’t worry dude,

  

d the entire band chimes in on the profond co-

we’ll put it in the middle; it will be like a commer-

cial.” Whatever they were thinking, it was a pretty

bad move. I guess this shows their deep, sensitive
side. I sure wish they’d invest in a thesaurus; pret-
ty is such an overused word.

If “Pretty Donna” sounds like bad elevator
music, then “Heaven’s Already Here” sounds like
a bad White Lion song. The lyrics are just too
much: “Wake up to a new moming/Got my babe
by my -side/Now I won’t yield to new
wamings/Cause I got my piece of mind  The
chorus is most inspirational: “Who’s gonna bring
me heaven/When heave'n’s already here?” Well if
that’s not the question of the day! I wonder if this
touching song was written for “pretty Donna?”
The music behind the words sound like a pathetic
attempt at the jazzier side of the Allman Brothers.
Oh well.

On a positive note, it is amusing to combine
“Pretty Donna” with the remaining song titles. For
example, “Scream” and “Pretty Donna” is damn
amusing, as is “Pretty Donna” and “Breathe.” I
think I have “Pretty Donna Breath” right now;
Taco Bell does it to the best of ‘em. Maybe you
saw Collective Soul last night at Graffiti and beg
to differ. You know what they say, “Opinions are
like assholes, we all got ‘em. Some are bigger than
others.”

SOUND

°From page 7

The Screamin’ Cheetah
Wheelies
The Screamin’ Cheetah
Wheelies
Atlantic

You hate to think about what
would have happened if the
fates had stuck the Screamin’
Cheetah Wheelies on another
label, one which perhaps
would have seen fit to suggest
to the band “how about incor-
porating more of an alternative
vibe into your sound, boys?
Throw in some lyrics that con-
demn the govemment; tell the
drummer to make some mis-
takes here and there 

Maybe what the people in
my circle love so damn much
about this disc is how obvious
it is that these guys haven’t
heard anything in the last 15
odd years, reaffirming the old
cliche: ignore everything
around you, decide what you
want to do, and dive in.

If you’re excited about see-
ing the Smashing Pumpkins as
Lollapalooza headliners, then
you're listening to music for

something that the Wheelies
can’t provide; yeah, that’s a
complement for them, and if
you’re feeling alienated, go
ahead and skip to the next arti-
cle.

The disc opens with
“Shakin’ The Blues.” I played
it at work, and Old Man Ed
muttered, “Its got a swampy
feel.” That’s more words from
Ed than you get on an average
day, so I knew the Wheelies
were on to something.

“Ride the Tide” is sort of a
late—July jamboree sing—along,
the kind you’d expect at a fam-
ily reunion — say in Carolina
— as if you’d ever have a fam-
ily that would reunite, you
1atch—key low,.life. “Something
Else” sounds
Junkyard would do with
“Whipping Postz” good—ol—boy
Chutzpah with some ‘90s elec-
tro—shock, and don’t hold your
breath while the kids on guitar
strut. “Slow Burn” isn’t. The
whole disc hits you with these
ramblin’, swayin’, lovely
Allmanesque guitars, but
somehow avoids the excess
that so often comes along in
the bargain. Face it: Greg and
Duane pioneered a genre, they

like what

didn’t perfect one. The
Wheelies know it, and on
tunes like “Moses Brown” and
“Let It Flow” they summon an
ethereal, dreamlike quality that
would make make Dicky Betts
take off his hat. That’s to say
nothing of singer Mike Farris,
kind’ve a Mississippi version
of Steve Marriott. Just about
every verse ends with him

i doubling over in agony —— he’s

only singin’ about some beau-
tiful sunset, but Baby, that’s
entertainment! C’mon, tell me
you weren’t the least bit curi-
ous about a name like
Screamin’ Cheetah Wheelies.
The Wheelies are playin’
Sunday at the Arena with
Meatloaf. The good news, I
guess, is that for the suckers
that actually buy tickets for
Mr. Loaf, they’ll get to hear
some decent chops before it all
goes down hill.

So you can get on this alter-
native bandwagon, pick up the
new Sonic Youth, or you can
look yourself in the mirror
each morning. Grampa said
buy things that last, so shell
out the nickels and pick this
one up.

e year
of the

i don’; think so.
Q Sure there has
' f been plenty of
outstanding
goaltending in

. the playoffs, —

W Hasek’s 70 saves in a quadru-

ple-overtime performance
against theDevils. But the play-
offs, through the years, have

. always been about goalies like

Ken Dryden, Bemie Parent and
Grant Fuhr standing on their

7, heads and stealing the show.

Scoring goals has become a
problem this year and high—scor-

‘ ing teams, like the Red Wings

and Penguins, have become
nonexistent. However in the
NHL playoffs, there is a little
more to this situation than sim-
ply great goaltending. '

The lack of goal scoring is
really a result of a more defen-
sive system that has been insti-
tuted by many NHL teams.

In past seasons, teams were
willing to send two forecheckers
deep into the offensive zone to
force turnovers and mistakes.
Now we are seeing only one
forward chasing the puck, while
the otherforwards hang back
waiting for a defensive lapse.
The result is a clogged neutral
zone and, therefore, less goals.

This conservative style of
play is epitomized by teams like
the the San Jose Sharks, the
Buffalo Sabres and the
Washington Capitals.

Ask the New York Islanders
and the Detroit Red Wings if
this isthe year of the goalie.
They would probably tell you
that it is the year of the horren-
dous goalie.

Two of the biggest ﬂops in the
postseason, the Pittsburgh
Penguins and the Detroit Red

Wings, were upset because of an

inability to adapt to a lack of

‘ skating room. Both teams

played to their opponents’
strengths by settling in and
allowing the games to become
grinding, defensive contests
instead of shootouts.

All of the teams which remain
in the playoffs are still there
because they can play a defen-
sive style, are very physical and
have the goal scorers to take
advantage of the opposition’s
defensive lapses.

It would be asinine to dispute
that the Devils, Rangers, Maple
Leafs and Canucks all have pre-
mier goaltenders. But the goal-
tenders have not put on any
greater a show than other great
goalies in Stanley Cup history.

Now that the Big East base-

.9-6 (.600) and right in the mid-

The Pitt men’s basketball team may
have found themselves the center they
have been searching for in the new post-
Mobley era.

His name is Gerald Jordan and he is list-
ed at 6-foot-10 inches and 225 pounds and
could possibly add some presence in the
middle for -the Panthers, who do not have
a true center on the current roster.

“He’s got a lot of potential and we are
very excited about Gerald,” Pitt assistant
coach Tom Crean said. “He gives us a
legitimate big man who can rebound,
block shots and also score. He can be a
heck of aiplayer in our system. He will be
a great’ addition to the team.”

Jordan is transferring from Morgan
State in Baltimore where he achieved
impressive numbers. He averaged 13.5

points and 10.2 rebounds per game which
was enough to earn him the Mid—Eastern
Conference Rookie of the Year honors.

In one of his better games this season,
Jordan had 23 rebounds against George
Mason, which broke their stadium record

‘previously held by NBA star David

Robinson. -

Coming out of West Philadelphia High
School, Jordan was a prop 48 casualty and
had to sit out his first season.

Jordan will have two years of eligibility
remaining for Pitt. However, the big ques-
tion is when his eligibility will start. He
could be in the lineup as early as
November, although he may have to sit
out next year if Morgan State is not put on
probation.

According to Mike Holmes, Morgan
State has been conducting an internal
investigation of the program and the

NCAA is not involved. “  ‘”""“““"‘ “‘

Jordan transfers to Pitt from Morgan St.

Along with the addition of Kellii Taylor
and" Chad Varga, new head coach Ralph
Willard and his staff seem to have sal-
vaged three quality players from what
looked like a possible nightmare recruit-
ing period.

The addition of Jordan is especially nec-
essary this year now that Eric Mobley has
graduated and 7-foot-4 inch Thomas
Hamilton has departed. The only current

- member of the team that is taller than 6

foot 7 inches is Jaime Peterson. So Jordan
would add some much-needed size to the
small Panther lineup.

Willard’s up-tempo style does not really
depend on the center to be a dominating
force. The position under his system
requires a more athletic player who can
get up and down the floor. However,

someone with a quality low-post .gaii.i_“ci::,:-R

Blair shines; women

nob third Cll ECACs

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

To most athletes, competing
in the East Coast Athletic
Conference championships is
a nightmare. But to the Lady
Panthers, it is like visiting
your parents on the holidays.

This year was no exception,
as Pitt captured third place in
the three—day competition at
George Mason University last
weekend.

.“We got third overall in the
meet and didn’t run every-
thing that we could’ve ran,”
senior captain Kim Blair said
of Pitt’s performance. “This
[meet] is fantastic. This is
great. I am proud and happy to
just be on this team.”

Many of her teammates are
just as happy that she is a part
of the team, as she spearhead-
ed their attack.

Blair did it all, as she shat-
tered the school record in the
400-meter hurdles with a time
of 57.72 seconds (The old
mark is 58.76).

Blair wouldn’t have broken
the school record if not for the
push of Angie Martin, who
was clocked with a time of
58.03, giving Pitt a-one-two
sweep.

“[Martin] ran up on me,
which made me run faster,”
Blair said. “Angie came up on
me in the second-to-last hur-

if

dle. I didn’t think it was her. I
thought it was the girl from
Georgetown. When I crossed
the line and turned around. I
saw it was Angie. I was happy
because she made the nation-
als too.”

At that point, Blair had only
began to warm up. Her next
challenge was in the 100-
meter hurdles.

And once again her stiffest
competition came from her
teammates.

In the finals she was nipped
at the tape by Pitt’s Allison
Williams.

Williams, the meet record-
holder, won with a time of
13.42 seconds to Blair’s
13.47.

In the field events, Najuma
once again led the way, as she
easily won the high jump (5-
feet 10-l/2-inches). the triple
jump (43-feet 3-inches) as
well as a second—place finish
in the long jump (21-feet l-
1/4-inches). .

Fletcher also teamed up
with Blair, Martin and Lakeya
Smith in the mile relay.

The foursome captured sec-
ond with a time of 3:36.76.

PITT NOTES:

° Staci Suggs, Fletcher and
Williams were named to the
Big East All-Academic team.

° The womens' track team
will try to qualify for nationals

the Huskies to break into the
four—team playoff field on the
season’s final weekend, they
would need to sweep last-place
Villanova at home and hope
that Pittcould take two of three
at St. John’s. V
On May 7, UConn kept their
hopes alive by defeating ‘Nova
6-2 and 9-5. Meanwhile the
Redmen managed to take the
second game of their double-
header with the Panthers 3-2
afterlosing 10-6 in the opener.
So, the final day of the sea-
son would decide who went on
and who stayed home. The
Huskies needed a win over the
Wildcats and a Panther victory
over St. John’s to make it in.
UConn did what they needed
to by crushing the Wildcats 9-2.
Their fate was then in the hands
of the Panthers, who essentially
had nothing to play for, having
already wrapped up the regular-
season title. -
So the Huskies waited, with
knots in their stomachs, for
word of the Pitt-St. John’s out-
come. The word they received
did not do much to cure the
butterﬂies. The game had been

postponed. UConn would have A

to wait another day to learn
their fate.

Under Big East regulations,
the makeup date for Sunday
postponement is the following
Monday. Any necessary devia-

tions from that schedule must

be immediately reported to’ the
league ofﬁce.

St. John’s players had final
W\clIH4uauuuo uu v uu ct . an
examinations on Monday; and:
therefore, could not make up
the game at the proper time.
However, St. John’s failed to
tell Big East officials of the sit-
uation ‘so that other arrange-
ments could be made.

The Big East baseball com-
mittee met to discuss the situa-
tion at hand, and the outcome
was devastating for the

Redmen. The committee ruled
that since adequate notiﬁcation
of the prevailing conditions was
not provided by the university,
St. John’s must forfeit the game
in question.

The Panthers were awarded a
9-0 victory in the final game of

the series, and St. John’s fin-
ished the season at 10-8, with a
.555 winning percentage.
Connecticut, after sweeping
their final series, finished the
regular season at 12-9 — a .571
winning percentage.
