Saint Patrick's   Day Celebration
  MoreiThanf' Erin Go Bragh"  

By COLLEEN MCDONALD
' Pitt News Staff Writer

Despite the fact thatASt.
Patrick never used Irish Spring
,.,soap and ran around in green
’ ‘shouting, “Erin go Bragh”; to
leprechauans and “colleens”
after a night out in ’Danny’s
Pub, we still continuqto honor

the parton saint of Ireland to—'

day. But how many of us really
know what the celebrating is
about? ,
St. Partick, for the record,
' _ was not even Irish. He was born
in Britain in 390 A.D,,. and
although Patrick was baptized a
Christian he probably was as
much of a pagan as any present-
day college student.
At , the ripe age of 16,
_ _Patricius Magonus Sacatus (St.
"*"Patrick), was captured by Irish
raiders and taken into slavery in
northeastern Ireland. For I’ six

years, Patrick served under. ‘the _

- Irish chieftain, Miliuc, herding
sheep and swine among
“the rugged mountains of An-
trim.” It was here that St.
Patrick, so to say, chose his
“major’-’—religion.

Patrick was either sick of
potatoes or else he had truly
found God in his heart. The lat-
ter is more likely for Patrick
escaped from Ireland returning
to his homeland England in
hopes of becoming a priest.

Upon arrival t’o the nearest
seminary, Patrick, the scholarly
‘instinct within him, studied for
30 odd years beforebeing or-

dained a priest and becoming a.

bishop. In the meantime,
Patrick’s expense account took
him to France and Italy and his
contemporaries ranged from
Martin of 'Tours to Attila the
‘Hun. ‘

Sporting a white beard, flow-
ing robes, and staff, St. Patrick
returned in.432 ..A.D to Ireland

admist the pagan Druids he had
left behind.

The Druids, worshippers of
the sun, did not take kindly to
Patrick. In fact he spent
another 60 years traveling
through the whole of Ireland
trying to convert the Irish in-
habitants to Christianity.
Patrick finally managed to
establish a church government
with its headquarters at Ar-
magh. St. Patrick’s “foot-
prints” can still be found
throughout the entire island of
Ireland. '

We celebrate St. Patrick’s
Day on March 17, for this day
marks the death of the 5th cen-

tury saint “who drove the

snakes from ireland” but mostly
it marks a day in which all may
don their greenery, ﬂaunt their
“smiling Irish eyes” and yes,

, even dance a_.jig, despite their

nationality. A t _ ‘

Farrar stressed that
students in residence halls, apart-
ments, and houses as well could
achieve through lighting an “inex-
pensive way to get an expensive
look.” ‘

«Farrar continued his discussion in _

a recent Pitt News interview about

I lighting. I .
“Lights can do many good things.

for a small room. If you think of
light as ‘in ‘art illumination, a ﬂoor-

can light, orfup light’ can be used
to show off a room. Of course, you
could run into some problems if
you have cracked or peeling ceil-
ings,” Farrar said.

The ‘up light’ is an inexpensive

lamp which can be placed along the
walls of a room, and can be
maneuevered to create various
shadow effects which can help con-
tribute to visual increase in the size
of a room. Farrar said that plants

-can be used with the lights tomake

interesting shadows as well.

“If you’re fortunate to be into
plants, you can put the lamp under
the plant, and let the light penetrate
through the plant onto the wall, or

ceiling,” he said.

Students should have _ desk

lighting for the specific purpose of

studying, according to Farrer. He
said that although a desk lamp
serves a “functional” purpose, it
can reflect the room’s
‘ ‘personality.’ ’

“Your room should be a
comfortable one, it can be made in-
to an atmosphere in which you
don’t mind studying in, yet you can
watch television in it as well,” he
said. _

Farrar spoke of a third kind of
lighting, -track lighting. He said
that itcould be used to “highlight

, anything from a poster to a pieceof

photography, to a painting. There
are many ways to arrange track

EducatioIn,Jobs,Leis are Activities’ Leadto Sdllisldllct

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt’ News Staff Writer —

Americans have to combine their
education, jobs, and leisure ac-.
tivities in order to achieve true
peace and satisfaction, according to
Dr. Graham Baxter, guest speaker
at the 7th annual winter business
meeting of Alpha Sigma Lambda
national honor society.

The meeting was held in Forbes
Quadrangle on Friday night. . _

Dr. Baxter, associate dir.ector_ of
Pitt’s Energy and Environment:

_- Center, was referingto “holism,-” a
1 theory that the _universe and’

especiallylliving nature should be

seen in terms of interacting wholes‘

rather than the mere sum of elemen-
tary- particles, and emphasizing the
organic or functional relation bet-
ween parts and wholes.

“I’m suggesting to the individual
student that he look at education,
working and leisure as three
separate entities, but only by put-
ting them together can he achieve

, satisfaction as a whole person” said

Dr. Baxter: ‘

But V one must be very] specifier‘

aboutgoals and “think through”

what one’s skills are, ‘Baxter said. 1

Writer Tells Of Life ’  

By WALTER R. WATSON
Pitt News Staff Writer
Anne Beatts, comedy writer for
NBC TV’s Saturday Night Live,
will speak tonight at Pitt._ Beatts
will relate her experiences over the
past ten years as a “chick in the
chuckle racket.” The lecture __is

sponsored by the Pitt Union Pro- '

gram Council. ’
“I’ll also be expounding on, my

views of the Universe,” Beatts said I

in a recent telephone interview.
When asked what made her
.choose comedy writing over the
other professions her B.A. in\
English Literature (McGill Univer-
sity, 1966), had prepared her for
Beatts answered, “I didn’t choose
comedy writing over other jobs. I
fell into it. I read Thurber,
Pearlman,- Berkeley, and Walter
Brooks’ ‘Freddie the Pig’ books.
You could say I was steeped in

..books, especially those that had

something to do with comedy.

When I was seven years old, I'can.

remember wanting for my birthday
comic books by Charles Adams

»(creator of ABC TV’s The Adams

Family). I didn’t understand most
of the humor in the books, but I
found a lot of it interesting.”

“When puberty finally kidnap-

ped my, it was as if I had seen a
light. At that time,’ I felt that
women weren’t supposed to be fun-
ny, that someday I was going to
take my place behind a husband,
who I’d help get to the‘top while I
stayed in the kitchen,” she said.
“As a result, I became a
copywriter for an advertising firm.
I was in Montreal when I started go-
ing out with this guy who worked
for National Lampoon. He
broughtme to New York. The only
names in New York I knew were the
ones in the masthead of National
Lampoon. I got mixed up with Na-
tional Lampoon because it was
basically" the only game in town.
Doug Kenney and Henry Beard
were the editors of National Lam-

' that

poon, and my boyfriend, Michel

Choquette would take _me to their

dinner meetings.

They (Beard and Kenney)
couldn’t tell Michel not to take me
along. I mean, they couldn_’t say,’
‘Let her cat at home,’ preferably
like a dog. Anyway, ‘at the
meetings, they’d write down ideas

\. for the magazine on paper napkins-

Later on, when they’d look at what
was written down on the napkins,
they’d ask each other, ‘Where’d
come
from?. I didn’t write that, did you?’
‘No, I guess that was Anne’s idea.’
And each time they’d keep finding
more and more funny thingsthat I
had thought of, until they asked me
to join National Lampoon. I got in
by accident.” ~

She has received four Emmy
Award nominations and won two
Emmys for her work with the
“Saturday Night” show. She
works “eight days a week” with the
show "and besides creating the
characters of “The Coneheads” for
“Saturday Night,” she helped to
give life to “The Nerds” characters
on the show.

“I was a class‘ freak in high
school. I was a nerd. Lisa Loopner
‘(one of the Nerd characters, played
by Saturday Night’s Gilda Radner)
thinks’ she is the greatest pianist in
the world. That’s where she~an‘d‘I
are different. Because she doesn’t
know that she’s a Nerd but I did
and I really suffered. Rosie Shuster
(another SNL staff writer) and I
wrote, Lisa. Gilda (Radner), Rosie,
and myself all share similar ex-
periences growing up. Lisa
Loopner is an amalgam of the ex-
periences of all three of us,” said
Beatts.

Beatts will speak at 8 p.m. in the
Ballroom of Schenley Hall. She

will answer questions concerning-.

Saturday _Night, comedy writing,
and women in the comedy fields.

Those people that are happiest are
those that "can fit their job,”and
they ask themselves, “Are my com-
pany’s values my values?”, he add-
ed. _ . , A

Baxter urges people to practice
“holistic medicine,” explaining
that many doctors find themselves
in a “curing syndrome,” as a result
of medical training being geared
towards curing ‘rat-her than preven-
.tive -training. A

“We have to accept responsibility.

for our own lives and‘ our own out-
comes,” he stressed.
-pathology and trying to prevent

“Instead of _

 

what’s already there, we should
take a ‘preventive view of health
care.”

Baxter also sees the concept of
holism as being applied to the
disciplines such as engineering,
business, and management, that by
combining these fields there is the
possibility that engineers can be ef-
fective managers, or doctors better
businessmen. - E I

Dr. Baxter stressed thefact that A _l
‘holism is a “concept of totality, i.e. .-

The ‘training requires collabora-

tion among the units to be effective,”

sending letters explaining the
change to the effected recipients.
Students then have ten days before
their benefits are cut-off._ McCor-
mick said that the effective date can
vary anytime between March 21 and
April 15, depending on the timing
of the letter. i ,

Current full time status ends on
April 23 and, according to McCor-_
mick, students whose benefits are

cut-off can apply for the summer i

only. _
“I don’t see any impediment to
their getting cash benefits the way

the law now reads,” he added,

“One week before April 23,
‘students should call their case
vvprker and make an appointment
— for April 24 or 25. If they wait too
long, they may not be able to get an
appointment for some time, due to
case loads.” — A
Several thousand students state-
wide are affected bythe new law.
About 1000 of these are in the Pitts-
burgh area, many of whom are Pitt
K students. , , I

The new law does not «affect part

should contact their case worker
immediately, McCormick said.

w Means believes there is too much red-tape and not

enough seriousness devoted to the evening school govern-
ment. Means maintains that students get “almost nothing”
in return for their activities fees. Means views it as “partly
a problem with the activities and perhaps more a problem
with communication.”

Means would like to see “an overall revision and recon-‘

sideration” of the council budget. With a three dollar ac-
tivities fee increase pending Board of Trustee’s action,

Means sees sufficient fund available for budget additions‘
and modifications. _.He hopes to be able’ to purchase pro- ,

duction equipment for the Night Times.
Sheldon Bogos, a Businessmajor, hopes to give night

V‘ school students the help they want and need. He would like

better-communication between council and students. -Also
he hopes to give students their money’s worth for their ac-
tivities fees. s '

“Some CGS students live on campus and do not know of
events. Now, if they don't know, students from far away
must have’ an awful time,” he said.

Bogos would like to see the Night Times given enough
money to “represent the evening students as they should be
represented.” As an addition to the budget, he would like

to see a Commuter Affairs Committee work with the day '

school committee. Bogos will aim “to eliminate wastes in

spending on personal expenses for all committees.

Nancy Dreher, a junior majoring in Administration of
Justice, would like to initiate a more comprehensive night
school-/curriculum. Dreher believes that the education

A evening students now receive could be expanded by holding

more seminars, inviting experts in. various fields to speak
and continually adding “pertinent, up-to-date courses.”

. “Pressing issues run the gamut from parking, to tuition,
increases and grades. But the most consistent question con-
cerns our activities fee,” she said. '

She believes that students are becoming increasingly con-
cerned with what they are receiving in return for the higher

_ fees they are paying. a

Dreher indicated that she would like to see additiona

funding for the mixers," and also a regular evening

newspaper printed. “‘ ‘ —

‘Dreher concluded by voicing" her support for elimination
of the annual evening student graduation dinner that costs
the council $12,000. ' '

Mary Hagan, also a candidate for the cabinet, wants “to

,.increase the publication of the Night Times and publicize
mixers so uninformed but otherwise interested students
could attend them.”

South Hills. ’ *

“The South Hills students are asking why there is no

is being.done to benefit students,” she said.

Hodge’s major campaign issue is the availability of stu- b
. dent services.

He would like to see more offices remain
open later several days during the week. He would like to
equalize night school services with those of day school.

Because students lose touch with beneficial services, he
would like a budget addition allocated for the Night Times

“Manyxstudents rely on this paper to keep them inform-
ed,’.’ said Hodges. - .

David Huffner, a junior majoring in Political Science
and Communications, is currently president of the evening
students and is not permitted under the evening student

constitution to seek another term. He instead is seeking a _

evening student’s; Huffner advocated better food and ven- '

ding services. With the experience, ability, and determina-

tion Huffner believes he possesses, he hopes to form a com- ‘

prehensive planfor the Night Times. He will also work for

Evening College Cabji:nef”iEIejlCfioIns

Huffner is most concerned with the price of higher
education, a problem, in his opinion, that is the most press-,
ing issue facing the CGS student. 7

“In only three years, my tuition has increased by 30 per-
cent,” he said.. But with effective lobbying in Harrisburg,
he believes, the state legislature can be made more aware of
the situation. Huffner believes it is necessary to keep
higher education affordable. .

In regards to next years’ budget, Huffner predicts the
evening students operating with a budget at its lowest point.
Advocating increases, ‘would be “unrealistic” according
Huffner, but he promises to spend every dollar wisely and
for the benefit of the evening.student.

Mary Phillips, a senior Philosophy major," states that
achieving “cooperation among CGS organizations is my
primarygoal.” A closer examination of allocations to the
organizations is essential if mismanagement and,‘
misunderstanding of funding is to be avoided. According
to Phillips, when this is accomplished organizations .can
best serve CGS students.

“The stigma given to evening students by day students,

faculty and prospective employers,” is,-in her opinion, a ~

most pressing issue. “If courses and services are expanded
and improved, then the stigma can be removed,” she said.

Seeing many CGS organizations matching funds ’
allocated to them by the cabinet is Phillips’ hope for the
budget. She is also in favor of giving funds to the newly
formed Veterans Advocates at Pitt. V

Cheryl Tomko, a junior business major, would like to
have more offices opened with more consistent and reliable
hours. She also would like to see the Night Times “become

I a viable publication providing information and bridging the

communication gap between students and the administra-
tion.” ~

Tomko believes communication is the most pressing issue
confronting evening students. "Students “need to be in-
formed as well as to inform.” Channels of information,
Tomko believes, need to be improved for the evening
students. ‘

“We are consumers buying a product—education and we
have the right toplace demands on our investment,” she
said. ‘ -

Same Old Song

They’re playing that song again. V .
We’ve all heard it before, each year when
Chancellor Wesley Posvar travels to Harrisburg to

_ state,his case for increased Commonwealth apropria-

tions to Pitt and the other state-related universities.

Each year Posvar explains that the fate of higher ‘

education is on the line if more money is not channel-
ed in the direction of Pitt, Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln Universities. ’

Posvar has repeatedly told the legislature that the
middle-class Pennsylvanian, who represents the ma-
jorTty‘-of students who attend Pitt is being priced out
of the state, driven elsewhere where a comparable if

, not better education can be received at a lower cost.

And, last but not least, Posvar tells the lawmakers
that Pitt cannot survive another fiscal year of
minimal aid from the state without raising its tuition.

But, as proven each year legislature turns a deaf
ear to Posvar’s pleas, with the obvioiis victims being
the students. ’ ' A

Last Friday, Posvar told‘ the House Appropria-
tions Committee that ‘anothe/r tuition hike (the fifth
in the last five years) could not be avoided if -the
university did not receivea 17 percent increase in_

funding from the state. ’ .

Governor Dick Thornburgh has already stated his
line on the case of funding for the state related and
state-owned colleges that would account for only a
six percent increase. The House and Senate are ex-
pected to honor Thornburgh’s wishes, during their
annual budget deliberations. - “ V

Last year, Pitt students paid $1590 in tuition.
Posvar said Friday he is uncertain how much they
will be paying next year, but if the 59 percent increase

in tuition over the pastﬁve years is any indication, 
students can be assured it will be substantially more; 
The bottom line and what’s more, the saddestfpart 
of this saga is that‘ while the cost of a state-supported,
education is drastically on the increase, the quality of
education received at these institu-tions is on the ,

decline. v

Programs have been terminated, one right after the ._ A
other because of the lack of funding. 'lThe-iAlt~er'- ‘ '

after graduation.
The state of affairs at the university could be sum-
med up no ‘more appropriately than in the words of

Davis N. Campbell, an associate professor in" "

Foundations of Education in his Friday March 14 let-
ter to The Pitt News. ' ‘

“Alternative Curriculum was the first to go, now.

Excessive Definition — Placing Limits on Everyday Lite

By NICK ARNETT

There’s a blackboard in the
Forbes Quadrangle which becomes
covered with numbers three times a
week. That might not be unusual if
a math class, or even physics, was
meeting there. Unfortunately, it’s a
political science course. One of the
cOurse’s professors has a peculiar
liking for numbers.

This professor is a digital per-
son—at least he seems to imagine he
is. He leads a measured existence,
and he’s not°alone in his affinity for
reducing concepts to figures. Com-
munications professors even teach
about mass media in terms of

~numbers—how many people watch
a television show, how much power
a radio station’s signal has, what
Circulation a newspaper enjoys——an
incredible quantity,.of quantifica-
tion. .  ,
‘Quantification’ loses value as it
-The

l

political science professor is loathe

to pass judgments.

.“Me, have an opinion on this?”
one can imagine him saying. “No,
I just have the statistics, you decide
what you like.” He shuns quality.
Perhaps he’s not qualified. I

Pitt has many examples of
digitalization—-—"Objective“ tests,
grades, I identification - by
number—all the systems intended
to quantify students. It‘ may be
twisting the meaning of ‘quality,’
but this trend seems to result in a
lower-quality education.

The alternative to digital, as every
computer buff knows, is analog.
The same nerd will tell you analog

computers are going the way/of the

dinosaur. However, man remains
more analog than digital.

An example: A digital view of
Iran might\label the Shah “good”
and the Ayatollah ‘bad.’ On the

"other side, an analog view might see,

the Shah as ‘moderately bad,’ and

the Ayatollah as ‘worse.’ The latter ‘

seems to be the correct system" for
passing judgment on Iran. ‘It’s not
a question of ‘good or bad,’ it’s the
degree of badness present—the
quality—that’s important.

I’m arguing’ against excessive
definition. The more you define,

_the more you’re limited. - It’s like
putting on a uniform. A badge and »

a gun will limit you, in your own
mind, to being a policeman, if

. you’re a digital person. There are

many kinds of uniforms. I used to
go to a college with an overdose of
preppies—-young men who couldn’t
travel without wearing a dickey and
a blazer—their uniform.

-Steeley Dan, in “Deacon Blues,”
sings the words, “This is the age of
the expanding man.” Expansion is
stifled by excessive definition. One
can’t grow (expand) unless he is
willing to surpass the old definitions
and try new ones. One means to ex-
pand is to recognize at least three
ways to 1oo)< at eve,ry_t/hing on earth.

1. The political science professor
at his extreme——subjecting
everything to _quantification. It’s
possible to define everything you
see, to make clever distinctions, like

Aristotle separating fields of study '
* into biology, physics, et. al. The

value of such distinctions is small.
2. The opposite extreme——draw
no lines, make no definitions. Let
everything be whatever it grows to
become. If I seem to be talking like
an acid tripper, it’s not because I’m
tripping, but because “tripping”
is chemical expansiveness. I’m
speaking’ like a person on LSD talk-

ing about “consciousness expan-‘“

ding,” or “transcending.” Luckily,
I speak from second-hand
knowledge.

3. A little of No. 1, a lot of No.
2—some definitions are necessary,
but expansiveness should prevail.
Definitions must grow, especially
self-definition. The only reason I
argue for the predominance of ex-

pansion (analog) over definition
(digital) is that it’s more fun. It’s
being assertive, the “New Me,” in
the current jargon.

A while ago, I wrote about
Woodstock, the rock concert.
Shortly after the column was
published, someone mentioned
another Woodstock to‘me——the one‘
in “Peanuts.”

/

Woodstock, the bird, has an in-«
dividual identity—a small, ‘self-

definition. He also has an expan-
sive self-definition—he’s a member
of a flock. ' All the birds in the‘ ﬂock
look alike—Woodsto‘ck is

sometimes impossible to single out,
While it may be right for us to

define ourselves as Pittsburghcrs or

_Americans—moderately expansive
more . "

descriptions——it seems
truthful and useful to call ourselves
humans. ‘Like Woodstock, we're
individuals, but like Iranians and

 Former Member~Offers Advice to SGB Representatives

I find it rather disturbing that our
elected student representatives have
decided to aid , our university

‘ _ administration in their earnest ef-

forts to establish Pitt’s reputation

- as “Reactionary U.” It seems that

being known as the first university

, in the nation to further restrict

visitation policies in residence halls
is' not enough. We have now

I. chosen to lead a nation-wide stu-

dent movement to support draft
registration. Is our endorsement of
Ronald Reagan far behind?

Even more regrettable than the

actual decision is that rationale of

SGB members in arriving at it. The
Board’s initial moves on the matter
were both positive and commen-
dable. The heavily attendedforum

on the draft was an excellent exam- .

ple of what student government can

. do. Unfortunately, subsequent ac-

tions proved to be far less fruitful.
The discussion which followed
Martin .Bertocchi’s anti-draft
resolution at the following meeting
was a prime example of the confu-

-_’ sion and lack of direction which has

 
  

 
 

their viewpoint.
. lengthy deliberation ensued and the

plagued the new Board. Several
Board members felt the forum was

xi ' designed to establish some type of

student consensus on which a
resolution could be based. Others
seemed to‘ think the forum was only
an opportunity for students to air
An extremely

Board finally came up with its deci-
sion, or -shall I say non-decision.

.-Since the forum had not produced a
. clear-cut . majority either for or

against draft registration, and since
several Board members seemed not

-to have enough confidence in their

own judgment, they decided to hide
behind another attempt at finding
student sentiment on the matter.

’ Namely, a survey.

Taking an accurate and reliable

' /survey is a most difficult endeavor,

and is one best left to professionals.
Although Student Government’s
survey taker is a highly competent

'. and dedicated individual, she does

not have the time or money to in-
sure that a survey is truly reliable.
There are several problems involv-
ed. Firstly, I find it highly doubtful

' that the sample measured in the

survey was random, -as this cannot

L the decision.

’ their viewpoints and

E be achieved by handing out ques-

tionnaires in selected classrooms.
Additionally, some students have
expressed doubt about the neutrali-
ty of the questions. Second,~ we
have been told little about how the
results were calculated.

In view of the survey’s doubtful
reliability,'I ﬁnd it sad that SGB

members decidedto substitute its V
‘findings for their own judgment.

Although the desire to establish a
pure direct democracy is commen-
dable, it is at the time infeasible. It
is infeasible for there is no accurate

‘way to gauge the sentiment of all

Pitt students, or even a good

representative sample in a cost-

efficient manner. The truth of the
matter is that in the end, you as an
elected representative have to make
I am not advocating
you‘ totally neglect your consti-
tuents’ opinions; Indeed, they
should play a major role in your
decision-making process. Yet,
ultimately it is up to youto decide
which course of action is right.
Finally, I am beginning to
wonder just who SGB has chosen to
represent us, or the administration.
Increases in the price of room and
board are simply announced by Mr.
Blazer with no apparent questions,
even though there remain substan-
tial doubts that we are currently get-
ting what we pay for. The march to
eliminate self-designed majors con-
tinues with no SGB resistance. The
extremely weak support given to
BAS on the issues of Curtis Porter’s
tenure and alleged campus police
wrongdoings are still further ex-
amples of the Board’s lack of back-

. bone.

‘ Slick-talking administrators are
rather persuasive‘ I will admit.
However, ‘it is important to
remember that is why they‘ are
where they are today. To accept
rationales
whole and without question is a
most dangerous policy. So come on
SGB, show us some guts. Don’t
abandon your intuitions, your prin-
ciples, and your concern for‘ your
fellow students. Hiding behind
surveys and‘ advocating‘ adminis-
tration policies will probably make
your job quite easy. In fact I know
it will. But I urge youio pass up

Response to
Letters on SGB

I am responding to a group of let-
ters which appeared in the Friday,

‘March 14 edition of. your paper. It

concerned the Resolution passed by
the SGB, and the respondents’ dis-
satisfaction with it. \

To the questions posed by
students Mann, Kane, Collins,
Plazek, Pendergast and Galper, I
can only respond by asking them if
they had filled out one of the survey
forms. Also, this issue has been in
the limelight ever since’ President
Carter’s proposed reinstatement of
registration for the draft. It has
been on the vast majority of the
agendas, ‘and discussed publicly.
Since this has been of such public
interest? '(“public” meaning the

'SGB’s public, i.e. the students), I

cannot recall ever hearing from the
above named students. Never in a
meeting; never in the SGB office to
make their feelings known’ or to in-
quire of our survey, , which was
publicly announced at our meetings
and, I believe, mentioned in The
Pitt News. Never have I received
word from the SGB -secretary that

‘the above student(s) have made an

appointment with me" or anyone else

during our office hours, (and Board .

Members’ have established office
hours). t ' -
I’m sure that if the Resolution
stated the other position we would
be receiving critical comment from
the other side. So, one never seems
to win. However, what is disturb-
ing is that it seems easier to write a
critical letter than to walk "three
floors to check things out and to
ask the same questions that were
asked by these concerned students.
Why do _people express their opin-

Survival in
Numbers

The University, of Pittsburgh is
currently making plans to shift its
fraternity system _to a proposed

’ fraternity complex, one that sup-'
posedly will be built inthe next five _

years on the hill above Alumni
Hall. This move poses many poten-
tially serious consequences to the
fraternity ~ system as 'a_ whole, as
many of its members already know.
2 At the top of the list of problems‘
with such a move is the University’s
ambiguity as to when the actual
building will begin and when it will

be completed. How much ‘will it ,

cost to build? How much will it
cost to live there? 

Secondly, is the University _acting
in good faith? How can we trust an
organization that is in the process
of forcing two of its fraternities out
of their houses? An organization
that is trying to pressure its frater-
nities, which own their houses, into
agreeing to move into the proposed
complex. In short, they are making
it increasingly difficult for the
fraternities to survive at Pitt.

And last of all, in whose interests
are the University officialsacting?
The University has been ignoring its
fraterniti'es’» needs for years. Now-,
whenit has become economically
profitable, they plan to sweep us
out of their way. ’

The present fraternity system is
not a perfect one. No system is. In-
stead of sticking up for the rights of
its students, the University would
rather conveniently push them out
of the way. Who benefits from

this? The students? Or the Univer-

sity bureaucrats?

Since it is apparent that the
University is unwilling to stand up
for our rights, then we must defend
our own. It’s time we‘ put our pre-
judices’ about each other’s frater-
nity aside‘. We have a common

cause; our own survival. The only 

way to insure our survival as ~ a
system is to work together as one.

By ANNA ARLOTT
’ _ Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pitt men’s volleyball team

 beat the University of Pennsylvania

to continue it’s undefeated streak in
Division II conference games. The
victory edges the Panthers closer to
an automatic seed in the Eastern
Collegiate Volleyball League
Playoffs at the season’s end.

Pitt disposed of Penn for the se-_

cond time this season in conference
match competition by scores of
15-7, 15-11, 15-9 in the best of five
match. Pitt handled Penn rather
well in the first and third games of
the match although the second
game found the score see-sawing
back and forth before Pitt took
command after a 10-10 tie. The
match displayed an entire team ef-
fort, with the jumping of Brian
Devine and Ricky Camacho, the
setting of Dave Baird, added to the
control of Don Hardin, Danny
O’Donnall, and‘ captain Jeff
Beavers. These make uup the start-

' ing team for coaches Ray Reilly

.and Mike Hebert.

The second
match of the day against Navy
found many of the backup players

A getting a great deal of valuable play-

ing experience.
“That win over Penn made us an
undefeated 5-0 in conference play,”

I " said Reilly. “They all played well, 1

think that they did an excellent job.
We can't look at individual play,

" because it takes such a team effort‘
' to be successful. ‘
’ though, that I’m very impressed
twith the play of Brian Devine this

I must say,

season, he has made such an im-

- provement. ”

1 The remainder of the team labels
Devine the “Dead Man” as a
nickname because of all the nagging
injuries that he has come up with

this‘ season. But, his play is quite
1 the contrary. The improvement

that has been shown over a year ago

has put him into the starting lineup ,

and is added factor to the Panthers
victories.
In ,a non-conference game with

>— , the Midshipmen of Navy the Pan-

thers won 3-1 with scores 15-3,
15-2, 6-15, and 15-5. The third
game, the only loss for Pitt all day,

.found the Panthers slacking off a

bit after so handily defeating Navy
in the first two games. .
The Navy team‘ is still playin

‘with club status, which is exactly

‘what the Panthers were until last

Men’s volleyball team in action a

ference pla y.
season when they were changed into
a varsity team. This match found
many of the Panthers -reserves see-
ing action with first stringers being
inserted here and there.

\

' The Panthers lost some of their
momentum in the’ third game but
quickly picked it up again when the
fourth game rolled around. Pitt

. Stu Svvanson

 

   

 

took ..a commanding
before defeating Navy 15-5 and

winning the second"*match' of the
afternoon. = '

Pitt will now look ahead to a
non-conference game against cross-
,state rival Penn State on Wednes_-
day. evening.,j The Panthers have
beaten the Nittany Lions in one

10-3 lead V

gainst Penn. The win _left the Panthers

game which came when the two
teams split in the ECVL open tour-
nament last weekend. Pitt was the
only team, besides the tournament
winner, Rutgers-Newark, to hand

. Penn State a defeat in that competi-

tlOl’l. ,_ . '

“I look for good things, when
looking towards‘ Penn State,” said

Floth photo

Reilly.. “The match that we split
with them at the ECVL was im-
pressive. We have to keep winning

in our conference matches,” said’

Reilly, “because Princeton is right
on our heels, although we are sitting
pretty good with three games to go
in Division 11 play. We just have to
be sure to not get’ overconfident,
but, we aren't that kind of team.”

Swimmer Swanson Qualifies For

By STEVE THOMAS

Pm News Staff Writer

Pitt’s Stu Swanson became the
third Panther swimmer to qualify
for nationals by winning two
backstroke events this weekend at

the Indiana Invitational at Bloom-

ington._

Swanson qualified Friday night
by winning the 100-meter.
backstroke event with a time of 51.9
seconds. Saturday, he took first in
the 200-meter backstroke event be-
ing clocked at 1251.6.

Swanson will thus join team-
mates Rick Carter, and Sandy
Pidgeon as they journey to Harvard
in two weeks for the NCAA Cham-
pionships, Carter had previously
qualified for nationals in the 50-and

100-meter freestyle ‘events as. did
Pidgeon who will enter the
200-meter breaststroke‘ event ’ at

V .

Harvard. 1

Swanson, ranked ninth national-
ly, was coming off impressive per-
formances at Easterns last weekend
where he won both his events
despite an illness, and having to
swim under extremely poor pool
conditions; _He also set .a new

PHILADELPHIA—Steve Waite
brought Iowa back from a 14-point
deficit in the second half and scored
a game-winning three-point play
with five seconds left to give the
Cinderella Hawkeyes an 81-80 vic-
tory over Georgetown yesterday in
the NCAA East Regional basketball

. championship game.

The victory sent the Big Ten team
into next weekend’s national finals

at Indianapolis as one of the NCAA .

Final Four teams. \
The Hoyas controlled the game

’&>ractically all the way behind Eric

Floyd’s marvelous long-range
shooting and held a mountainous
46-32 lead with about a minute gone
in the second half.

The Hoyas still led by 10 points,
at 64-54, when Waite, a 6-foot-10
substitute from Iowa City, came in-
to the game and made his presence
felt. .

Waite scored 13 of his 15 game-
total points in the last 11 minutes,
including a three-point play at the
end that provided the Hawkeyes’
lead and their clinching basket. Jeff
Bullis scored Georgetown’s last two
points with one second left for the
final score.

The exciting contest was tied five
times in the last seven minutes in-
cluding 78-78 when Georgetown’s
Craig Shelton put in a field goal
with 2:05 left.

Vince Brookins scored a team-
leading 22 points, many of them on
long range shots, for the Hawkeyes,
a team that tied for fourth in the

Big Ten and lost a total of eight
games before the NCAA playoffs.

The Victory over the nation’s
11th-ranked basketball team, im-
proved their record to 23-8.

Floyd wound up with a game-
leading 31 points for Georgetown,
the Big East champion, which had a
15-game winning streak stopped

and finished its season at 26-6.
Floyd scored 13 of his points in
the first half and helped the Hoyas
take a 42-32 lead at intermission.

junior pumped in 16 points to keep
the Big Ten team within shooting
range of the Hoyas.

The first half actually was virtual-

crisp, long-range shots. ,

Steve Waite Scores Winning Points

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA-_—Substitute

Iowa center Steve Waite had two ,

thoughts in the last minute of play
as ' the Hawkeyes captured the
NCAA East Regional basketball
championship with an 81-80 victory
over Georgetown yesterday,’ ,
With the score tied at 78 and
Iowa in possession, the Hawkeyes
took two timeouts, unable to work

the ball in for a shot. Then forward -

Kevin Boyle broke for the middle

and hit Waite near the basket. '
“My first thought was to pass the

ball back to a shooter,” said Waite,

A a 6-foot-10 junior who instead took

a step inside and put in the winning

basket with five seconds left».
Waite was fouled on the layup by

Georgetown. forward Craig

_Shelton, his fifth, and went to the

line with a chance to" give the
Hawkeyes an insurance point.
Georgetown called timeout, hop-
ing Waite would think a little too
much about shooting the foul.

    Ve   
 To Form For Pitt

By ANNA ARLOTTA.

Pitt News Staff Writer

This year’s men’s volleyball team
is loaded with fresh, young talent.
It consists of a sweep of new players
the letterman
returners of a year ago. It is this
that has boosted the Panthers into a
strong contender in Eastern
volleyball circles. \ . '

One of those new faces that
coaches Ray Reilly and Mike
Hebert are proud to call Panthers is
setter Dave Baird. Baird did
something last year that many peo-
ple do before deciding to come to
college and that was to.» stay out a

- year of school.

“I really didn’t know just what I
wanted to come to school for so I

decided to wait for a year before

making the move to choose a col-
lege,” said Baird. ‘

In that year, Baird played little
organized volleyball but kept in,
shape partly by being an assistant
coach at his high school, Steel
Valley. While a member of the
Steel Valley varsity, he was a star-
ting setter for three years and
received all-state recognition his
senior season. The team placed se-
cond in the state that year.

Despite Baird’s decision to sit out
a year of school and volleyball he
certainly has lost nothing from that
all-state performance that he had
back in high school.

“It took a while in August to get
back into playing again, but I
don’t think that has any effect on
my play now,” said Baird-.

In part, Baird’s decision to come
to Pitt was due to the fine coaching

that the Panthers have in Reilly and

Hebert. The.starting program, in

it’s second year of varsity status,
posed a good opportunity for Baird
to see a great deal of action once the
season was underway.

“I thought with Pitt in it’s begin-
ning stages of volleyball that’ I
would have a good chance to play a
lot,” said Baird. “Also, ' I heard
that Mike (Hebert) was an excellent
coach and I was thoroughly. im-
pressed with his record at Pitt. I
knew that Ray (Reilly) was going to
take ‘over the men’s team and that
he would be a good instructor too.
So I decided that I should be able to
learn a lot from these two.”

. Whether Baird has gained a head
full of knowledge from Hebert and
Reilly or the fact that he has the ex-
perience and ability to perform well
/for the Panthers can be seen in his
play throughout the season.

Baird began his playfor the Pan-
thers in early September when the
Polish national team visited Pitt-
sburgh. He saw some action in that
game but ended up leaving with an
ankle injury. When Reilly and
Hebert decided early in the season
to alternate their offense from a
strict 6-2 style of play to a 5-1 style
(using only one setter instead of
two), Baird got the nod to do the set-
ting. - .

“I was doing some outside hit-
ting, but I would much rather set,”
said Baird. “It’s.easier to concen-
trate on a 5-1 because all you do is
set.’’- i

The Panthers are now "down to

, their final conference games until

they find out if they will be receiv-
ing that automatic seeding in the
ECVL tournament at the end of the
year.
