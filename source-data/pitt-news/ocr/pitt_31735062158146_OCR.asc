Unity, Not Division

Top Discussion
At Convention

Pitt religious advisors will
convene. Friday, Nov. 19, at

' Pennsylvania C o 1 l e g e for

Women for the second annual
discussion of religious prob-.
lems that confrontthe Uni-
Versity.

Chaplain Luccock will direct
the discussion on the» belief that
“religious interests, faith and life
ought to bring students together
instead of dividing them.” .

Highlighting the day will be
reports by Prof. Clara Jane Doug-
las, on the Science Religion Sem-
inar at Penn State, Frof. Edwin R.
Steinberg, on the Panel of Ameri-
cans and on possibilities of Inter-
Faith fellowship and discussion,
and Russ Bradley, director of the
National Conference of Christians
and Jews, on his experiences and
ﬁndings in Germany.

“The purpose of a campus
chapel,” said Chaplain . Luccock,
“is not to have all students wor-
ship in one‘ faith only, but to
provide the ﬁnding of objectives
and qualiﬁcations that will enable
students to use education towards"
understanding others. The chapel
presents a permanent place to get
what is not provided anywhere in
classrooms and textbooks.”

Religious advisors to be present
at the conference are Mr. Paul L.
Offenhiser, Baptist; Father How-
ard J. Ford, Catholic; Mr. James
Van Buren,_ ‘Disciples of Christ;

Dr. Zasloff Returns to Pitt A
For Political Science Position

I Relates Suspicion

Toward Americans

In Prison Camps

By BARBARA CHERINGTON

Pitt reclaimed a former stu-
dent when Dr. Joseph H. Zas-
loff accepted an assistant pro-
zfessorship in political science
this fall, after eight years of
study, work, and travel in
Europe. .

After getting his bachelor’s
degree in 1946, and master
in ‘letters, 1947, Dr. Zasloff did
research work for the United
N a t i o n s-Palestine Conciliation

’ Commission in Geneva, Switzer-

land. At about that same time he
published a study of problems be-
fore the U. N. entitled, Great
Britain and Palestine.

Dr. Zasloff obtained his Ph. D.
in International Relations at the
University of Geneva in 1952.
During the following two sum-
mers, he attended Harvard ﬁni-
Versity.

Saw Horror Museum
I Between writing, studying, and
‘later sworking for the United
States'Air Force as an education
specialist in Landsberg, Germany,
he travelled through Europe.

His travels took him behind
the Iron Curtain, to Czechosla-
vakia and Poland. Because cer-
tain identification pap ers
Weren’t in order, he spent three

A days in a Polish prison. There

extreme suspicion was held to-

ward all Americans. ’

» D1. Zasloif saw‘ one of the P01-
ish concentration camps, turned
into a horror museum commemo-

"rating Germany’s slaughtering.

This symbolizes “man’s vicious-
ness toward men,” said Dr. Zas-
loff. . '

But other sections of the “cur-
nacious. He visited various fam-
ilies and friends, where he made
use of his knowledge of French,
German, and Russian.

Hiked Across Boot

Dr. Zasloff hitchhiked “across
the boot of Italy to Naples.” Then
he sailed through the Mediter-
anean Sea to Israel with 300 refu-
the people live and work on com-
munal farms to conquer the bar-
ren soi1.” _ ‘

After spending five or six
weeks in Israel, Dr. Zasloffi
lived in London one year work-
ing full-time - on the British-
Palestine policy. He talked to
Parliament, members and other

The political science instruc-

tor went. skiing in Germany
from October through May, and
in Gudgastein and Switzerland
during Christmas vacation.

“A four hours’ trip” from
Landsburg, Germany was all that
Dr. Zasloff needed to get into,the
Bavarian Alps in Germany and
to the foothills of the German
Alps in Austria.

Dignity Demonstrated

Another socialist country he
visited was Yugoslavia. Although
this country is not behind the

'-Iron Curtain, it is governed by

Titoism.

This country demonstrated
much diginity toward" visiting
Americans. It is a poor country
with only one or two real
roads,” said Dr. Zasloff.

He went through Zagreb, Spain,
Madrid, and Copehagen on Week-
ends. While stationed at- Geneva
he ‘bicyled during vacation time
through Italy, the Riveria in
France, and to Holland.

"Dr. Zasloff, returned to the
United States in 1952 to teach pol-
itical science at Allegheny Col-

lege, Meadville.

Cheating Is Illegal;
 Stiff Penalty Results

Failure, Dismissal Can Result;
Exceptions to Rule Are Limited

The University has again madeé

it plain that cheating in the class-
room is illegal and will be severly
punished.

Cheating on examinations and
plagiarism of themes or other
written works are among the
things which will be considered

as infractions of the rules. Stu-

dents are reguired to present the

results of their own work except‘

under circumstances in which the
instructor may haveprequested or
approved the joint efforts of a
group of students. It is the res-
ponsibility of the individual in-
structor to enforce the penalties
and report his action immediately
to the dean of his school.

For the ﬁrst offense, the penalty

_ for cheating is failure of the as-
signment and disciplinary pro-

bation. Cheating on the ﬁnal
semester exam, except in rare
cases, will mean failure in the
course. The faculty member is
then required to report the oﬁense
to the dean of his school.

Second oifenses will be report-

ed byteachers in the same man-

ner. The punishment in these cases
will be dismissal from the Uni-
versity. When a student is dis-
missed it is recorded on his per-

strars oﬁice. After an absence of
one semester a student may apply
for readmission.

In each of the various schools
there is a disciplinary committee,
made up of faculty members, with
the dean acting as chairman. It is
the duty of this committee to hear
all cases’ involving cheating and
other relating matters. If the
faculty member feels that a stu-
dent is guilty of cheating but the
student denies guilt, the faculty
member is required to present the
case to the disciplinary committee
of his school for a hearing and
ﬁnal decision.

Student groups or individ-
uals who would like to per-
form at the Penn State pep
rally, ﬁfth hour, Friday, Nov.
19, are urged tolcontact Paul
Petro, Student Congress As-
semblies committee chairman
or Charles Elliott, assistant to
the dean of men, in 801 C1.

, “Freshmen should be told not to go home so early.”
This pointed remark resulted as several members of the
faculty discussed the week-end at Ohio State. 1‘

It is not as revolutionary as it appears at ﬁrst glance

_but does present a very possible long sought after, always

beyond reach, answer to the problem of student apathy.

It has long been the custom of freshmen and, unfor-
tunately, a great segment of the rest of the student body,

to depart post—haste for the homestead after their last.
~ classof the day has been dismissed. This misguided won-

dering results in the individual never acquiring the beneﬁts
of association with his fellow students.

, If the student has not already derived all possible ben-
eﬁt from the environment of his neighborhood by the time

he is 18 or 19 years old he might just as well give up for he

has missed the things he should have gained during his
childhood and these can never be had once he has departed

‘ thatrealm and stepped into a college ‘environment.

Some freshmen hurry homeward in order to secure a

- place of dubious honor _in ‘the path of homeward bound

high school students who comprise a part of his acquaint-
ances. Supposedly, when these students see him, they are
to look upon him as the big wheel, the college man, the high
school boy who made good. But he hasn’t. For in this line
of reasoning he has lost his identity as a college student by
reaching back for his high school days. ’

F It is, in fact, entirely within the realm of possibilities
that he may learn a little about not only his classmates but
himself as well. Those students who live respectively in
McKeesport and Beaver Falls might overcome the dia-
metrical opposition of their residences by stopping long

, enough on the common ground of the commons room to

meet and discuss their problems, their gripes, and their
views on student life.

For those who remain after class there is an activities
program extensive and varied. This has already been pro-
vided thus eliminatingthe need for too great an initiative
on the student’s part. Within the organization there is, how-,
ever, a place for initiative.

Furtherprovision is found throughout the faculty and
administration in the form of advisors for the organizations.
These people devote.time to activities with the result that
the students engagedtherein are provided with the council
of experience. _ - ~

As for a meeting place, the need exceeds the provision.
Tuck Shops serve but only as a last resort. Fraternity and
Sorority-houses serve, but only for their members. The

' Commons Room serves, but oppresses enthusiasm by its
‘ very austere and hush inspiring architecture. A student

Union would serve if it were. ..But it isn’t. Yet.

' ing at the paved road to peace.

On lnsignificance

By Joan Thomas

Anybody who thinks a little is’ probably tor-
tured at some time by the stabbing realization
of insigniﬁcance. When we look at the engulﬁng
masses in the slums, in the streets, huddled on up
elevators, or in the ranks of, the great, we are
scared.

Individuals struggle to climb,
sucked up by the crowd—into
pits of defeat, dissatisfaction, re-
morse, and ﬁnal gloom. They are
constantly thwarted in_ their ﬁght
for accomplishment, stamped up
on by members of the rat race.
Social climbing rats, rats seek-
ing false reknown, rats gnaw-

but are soon

 

Bewilderment

Those who want to create,
want to see, will take side roads. They seek inner
peace, the peace to be found only through inner

 

satisfaction, of attained goals, and fulﬁlling a pur-.

pose in life. That way one dies at peace. That
way death is not a stodgy ceremony. Instead it is
a shocking event. And , more people weep, not
warm tears of politeness, but hot tears of re-
morse, bitterness, and bewilderment that some-
body so great must die, - ‘

‘ Some have a mere desire for fame. They would
like their names to blare from history books and
journals as someone who had reached into the
thickness of the unknown.

Mud and Stones

These are the people -, who prefer paved roads.
But such routes have usually been made hard
and cold, cemented by strong machines of faith,
courage, and will. They are not to be tread upon

 

by jelly ﬁsh. Their home is the engulﬁng sea.
It is the side roads of mud and’ stones that must
be taken. It is with soiled shoes and bruised feet
that one sleeps well. F‘

But too many are satisﬁed with a warm ‘hearth
and a wooly rug. And as their hair whitens they
take pleasure in buying funeral lots, dictating
wills, and prescribing clothing to be worn in the
casket. '

The murky form of routine insidiously creeps
into their lives. Their only aims in life seem to

be getting dinner on the table at 6:00, iron white,

shirts without traces of scorch, and to have the
garbage out in time for the weekly collection. The
few who have any feeling of making a contribu-
tion to society suppress it. ‘ ‘
Muscles and Veins

They leave unexplored ﬁelds for the others,
the talented one. Here again insigniﬁcance cries
out. It ﬂexes the muscles and pulsing veins on its

ipowerful encompassing arms.

...One begins to wonder about the use of dusting
under furniture that will re—gather gloomy dust,
the use of chasing out with garbage that might just
as well rot in the wastebasket, the use of peeling
leafy vegetables for an anapesto.

Depression sets in, and one wonders why’ he
is here. He wonders of his use. ,He even realizes
that the appearance in the casket doesn’t matter.
The sad viewers won’t be around that long to
remember or to be sad.

The ﬁxed pattern of birth, plodding, death, and
replacement. becomes haunting, jeering.

Those who have accomplished something to
pass»on‘to future generations smile, perhaps scorn-
fully, perhaps sadly, atlthe masses. For they had
enough willlto ﬂex a muscle that scared insigni-
ﬁcance.

Coup Cracks Defense

It looks as _ though Mendes-

area. I think
PMF expected it.

Only two weeks ago, Eden,
Dulles, Adenauer & Co., obtained
a go-ahead from the French

-prime minister to start‘ develop-
ment of twelve German divisions
for Western defense. But before
allies got the concession, Mendes-
France had the.Saar amendment
added to the pact.

Industrial Saar Needed

The Saar is 991 square miles of
rich coal mines and steel ‘mills
located between France and Ger-
many’ with control being exer-

countries in the past. But most

of the people there contributed to
the axis cause during the big
war. Paris terms would make it
internationally controlled by an
independent governor of some
sort. .

However, members ‘of the
Reichstag have voiced violent op-
position to the agreement. Chan-~
cellor Konrad Adenauer has
weakened to a revolt in his coali-
tion cabinet by the powerful Free
Democrats (FDP). ’

In fact, sentiment is growing
among West Germans for neu-
trality. Citizens feel that a neu-
tral government composed of a
united Germany would serve as a
“buffer” state between Russia
and the West. Three pre-Hitler
Chancellors of the republic have
been quoted as favoring some
kind of deal with Russia to that
effect. The USSR seems to like it.
Germans Independent ,,

The truth of the matter is that
while allied ‘forces need the
twelve divisions to create a strong
army, Germans no longer need
the allies. Aided by American
funds, the defeated country is in
far better shape than victor
France. Last year in fact, Bonn
exportsin machine tools exceed-
‘ed that of the United States by a

hundred million dollars.

he has todo. A
A Loaded Schedule

Two boys had three major ex-
ams in one day. Another student
had two mid-terms, a paper and
30 pages to read. This tired re-
porter had two exams, two pa-’
pers, about ﬁve chapters to read
and a paper to write!

You say perhaps it’s the stu-
dent’s 0VV\n fault. Perhaps it is.
But even if a student keeps up
to date it is necessary to go over’
all material thoroughly before a
big exam. “

No wonder half the Pitt stu-
dents look like they’re half asleep.
Haveiyou noticed, too, how many
students have colds and Trun-
down conditions this week. And
how crowded the libraries have
been lately!

Dismal Forecast

I_t’s deﬁnitely the ‘season of
snow‘ ﬂurries, bitter blasts,- and
dismal exams. Ofﬁcial forecast: .
a long, cold winter. .

 

He made it a point during the
nine-power c o n f e re n c e that
Francewould not ratify a, German
rearmament treaty unless it was
accompanied by a settlement of
the future of the Saar. Only Ger-
mans will suffer the wrath of
allied powers. But they don’t
particularly care. They’re getting
along ﬁne without a war produc-
tion scale. 1 '

U.S. Hopes Shattered

‘ Neutrality plans will shatter

-an”y hopes‘ for Americans who

saw the Paris—London pact as a

means to enjoin Germany to"

NATO indirectly through the
Brussels Pact. And General Al-
fred Gruenther, Supreme Allied
Commander Europe, will -be
forced to shelve a complete time
schedule he had drawn up ‘even
before the EDC defeat to rearm
our old enemy by 1957.

It appears that events will
eventually shapeup for (1) a
neutral Germany, unarmed but
uniﬁed; (2) a weak allied army
in Europe supported only by
United States and British troops
and cash; (3) a satisﬁed French
government stabilized under the
astute‘ leadership of a master
statesman; and (4) ah American
crusade against Russia and vice
versa with all other countries sit-
ting back to watch the show.

Mendes-France knows what he
wants. And he’ll getit.

Instructors are tightening the
screws on the already writhing
students. Some students felt the
pressure last week and some will
next week. But in every case it
seems a.student’s work all piles
up at the same time.

It is not fair to a student to
have three exams on the same
day. Naturally he can’t do his
best on any. Yet he is putin
competition with some students
who have only one exam to study
for.

Exams Helpful » ,
Exams, tests, and ‘quizes are
helpful to some extent. Notes
and facts mentioned inclass don’t
actually jell in the student’s mind
until he has spent a good night
of intensive review for a test.
Some system whereby all ma-
jor exams and papers don’t crash

down on the student like a ton of.

bricks should be devised. It
would beneﬁt both students and

COLLEGE SMOKERS PREFER Luckies—and by a wide
margin——according to the largest and latest coast-to-coast
college survey. Once again, the N o. 1 reason: Luckies taste
better. They taste better because Lucky Strike means ﬁne
tobacco. Then, that tobacco is toasted to taste better.
“I t’s Toasted”— the famous Lucky Strike process — tones
up Luckies’ light, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste
even better. The pleasure you’ll get from Luckies’ better
taste is vividly depicted in the Droodle above, titled:

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
This coming Monday afternoon,
Coach VOlson’s high-geared harri-
ers will be out to cop the 46th
annual IC4A championship at Van
Cortlandt Park in New York City
--one that they missed by only
two points last year and haven’t
won since 1924. _

“We ought to at least ﬁnish in

the ﬁrst ten,” commented Olson,
“providing our top seven boys
V are in good physical shape.” But
there is already one drawback
that could spell doom for the
team that hasn’t lost in 17 con-
secutive meets. 1
Arnie Sowell, 880 champ and
star runner, h-as contacted the
virus .. bug that could possibly
shelve him as the Olsonmen go

' after the big one. “If Arnie can’t

run, ‘we’re licked,” Olson empha-
sized as the Blue and Gold pre-
pared to do battle with the best
runners in the nation.

Five ﬁien, including stars Walt

, Starz, Don DelliGatti, and Pete

Kress, are mising from last year’s

‘ team that ﬁnished second behind

Michigan State.
The only runner with any
tournament experience is Cap-

tain Alan Gunderson who placed ~

13th last fall with a. mark of
25:56 for the ﬁve mile course.
But the strength of the Pan-
thers has been augmented by the
ﬁne running of — veteran Bob
Cherry, who along with new-
comers Sowell, Jim Moore, Jack
Schubert, Thorton Smith, and
Tom Jessup, has built the locals
into a top-ﬂight outﬁt that will
undoubtedly make their presence
well-known before the last‘ entry
crosses the ﬁnish line in the

Hero. One Day_
Bum the   Next

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

There’s a pretty odd situation going on at Nebraska. It
seems that last winter everybody but the people who count
didn’t want Coach Biif Glassford to continue as the mentor
of the Cornhuskers. .

Quite a ruckus was put up but Glassford, a Pitt grad,
remained at his post and now is just about the toast of the
town. Reason: his Nebraska team has copped ﬁve games so
far and stand a good chance of getting into the Orange Bowl
as-representative from the Big Seven Conference. ‘

I guess this must be a lesson in perserverance or
something similar, but it also brings to mind that old
sports adage about a “hero one day and a bum the
next” except that in this case, it’s backwards. ,

Big Bill, moreover, brought himself back into focus b
going backward into his own 
past for form of attack.

Last year, using mostly
the air ways to travel, both
during the game and to the.
game, the Huskers notched

press.» This s e a s o n , Biﬁ
switched to the straight
ground plays that he learned
so well as a guard on the Jock
Sutherland-coached elevens of
1934-36 and sure enough—’
success.

I Also he can probably
teach this style of attack‘bet-
ter than anything else for he
had to know his lessons well Glass-ford

to make All-American here in his senior year.

Statistics point out that in the first six games for the
Nebraskans, they averaged an amazing 250 yards per
game on the lower level. While they do occassionally
pass, it’s been at the rate of eight throws a» contest and
in this day of high-scoring football and a lot of passing,
this is a rare situation. ‘ ’

Coach Walt Cummins, who has been scouting them, says
that “while the passing hasn’t been dominating, it’s been
effective.” As to their running, Cummins stated that the

 

.Huskers depend mostly on straight power with not too much

variety. In fact, the Nebraskans used one play, a regular
handoif into the line, 17 times this past Saturday in the
Kansas tilt.

since it has been the backbone of
this year’s squad.

However, the Middies may
prove to be a tarter. The future
admirals have been pointing for
the Panthers since they lost a
heart-breaking one-point decision
to Penn State earlier in the sea-
son. 

The locals have shown a devas-
tating ground attack running from
theiestraight-T. Quarterback Dick
Bowen hasn’t thrown much, but
the Panthers may pull a surprise
and feature an aerial game this
week.

Ed ‘I-Iumeston, rangy end, has
developed into a fine offensive
threat and may combine with
Bowen in an attemtp to flood the
airlanes with passes.

The Panthers, who tied Penn
State 6-6, and defeated Kent
State in previous outings, are
anxious to preserve their un-
beaten slate.
