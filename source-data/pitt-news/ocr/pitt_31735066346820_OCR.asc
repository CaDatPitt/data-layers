Book Exchange
Response Seen
As ‘Fantastic’

By VIJAY JAIN

Bernice Kimel, chairman of the
Student Government book ex-
change committee, stated’ that the
student response to her plea to
turn over the books they wished»
to dispose of was “fantastic.” She
explained that they had received
ﬁve large cartons of books, ‘most
of them for use by freshmen and
sophomores. , .

“There will be one more col-
lection made on the first day of
school in "September. This will be
for the beneﬁt of students attend-
ing the spring trimester and those
who left their books at home dur-
ing vacations,” Miss Kimel said.

The book exchange will take
place over the first two weeks of
school throughout the day on Mon-
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
The books will probably be placed
in the Student Union cloak room.
The book owners will receive their
money and unsold books on a holi-

¢Litchﬁeld met last Wednesday, the
Mayor said, “I assure all groups
that City Planning will survey
all equitable possibilities within
this broader renewed area and
will recommend a site or sites
which willmeet the essential re-
quirement of being contiguous to
the major educational institutions
so rightly urged for consideration
by Dr. Litchﬁeld.

Chancellor Comments

“There is no question that the
research park proposal represents
a tremendous opportunity which
this city will do every thing pos-
sible eo encourage.”

Chancellor Litchﬁeld replied
that, “This is what I like about
Pittsburgh. Things happen with
so many community groups
pitching in to help.

“It is a great compliment to the
civic leadership that the Mayor
and the City move so quickly and
positively on the idea of a major
research park.

“We are eager to bring good re-
search establishments and jobs in-
to the area as soon as possible. We
look forward to the City’s'recom-
mendations.”

The Mayor mentioned that the
Forbes-Fifth Avenue corridor or
Lower Oakland —- between the
boulevard of the Allies and the
Penn Lincoln Parkway —- would
be considered for the research
park. 0

Board Names _

‘I and F’ Editor

Ed Roberson has beerf named
editor of the student literary
magazine “Ideas and Figures” for
the next issue.

The selection was made by a
board consisting of Fine Arts Pro-
fessor Virgil D. Cantini; Jack Kol-
bert of the Modern Language De-
partment; William C. Stanley, Jr.,
from Fine Arts; Irving N. Roth-
man, Student Publications direc-
tor; and Susanna Downie, last edi-
tor of the magazine.

Roberson served as associate
editor last term and was previous-
ly a staff member. His columns
have appeared in the Pitt
News and his poetry in both
“Ideas and Figures” and “Mann-
scripts.” _ , _ ,

in the country.”

The station is already adver-
tising for Ford Motor Company
in repayment for the installa-
tion and upkeep of the United
Press International Teletype
which WPGH recently obtained.
As planned the proposed budget
would let the station pay back
the $15,000 investment and make
a small profit by the end of
1966.

Money, according to Johnson,
could come from the University
itself, from outside foundations or
companies, or from a loan, .with
the University providing collater-
al. He emphasized the “uniqueness
of the plan to repay the invest-
ment,” and added that “some other
campus organizations receive more
money in one year than the station
is asking as a total investment.”

Position Promised
The station has been promised
the position of regional switching
point for the ‘college radio net-
work, which Johnson says he can-

tions. He also stated that WPGH
is an ideal spot for an international
switching point. _

He added, “The radio can be
_ a powerful force, as evidenced
even in 1938 by the panic caused
by the Orson ‘Welles broadcast
of “The War of the Worlds.” It
could be the unifying force that
the campus needs.

The staff for the spring trimester
will include program director, Jim
Kleinberg; assistant program di-
rector for production, Jeff Travis;
news director, Dave Crawford;
news editor, Kathy Grant; sports
editor, Joel Spiro: and chief en-
gineer, Jerry Malin.

Alcohol Study

Art Pape ‘Deceived’

By Council, Sabota

On Missing Motion

Art Pape, president of In-
ter Fraternity Council, re-
cently stated that he felt “de-
ceived” by the student gov-
ernment and Richard Sabota
over the alcohol issue.

IF accepted the proposal only
after Sabota had assured the body
that SG had approved a motion
which would extend the drinking
privilege to the rest of the student
body after it was tested success-
fully on the fraternities. Upon re-
viewing the alcohol- proposal Dr.
Alan C. Rankin, asistant chancel-
lor of Student and General Affairs,
remarked. that no such motion was
passed.

“Without the motion on extend-
ing the privileges to the rest of
the student body I do not think the
propo_sal would have passed and I
feel neither will it pass in the
future.” Pape continued, “the pro-
posal has been returned by Dr.
Rankin for further study to the
SG and we will leave the next
move to them.”

Pape Continues

Pape commented that he felt
Dr. Rankin had correctly inter-
preted the voting in IFC. The
voting in Interfraternity Council
was 16 to 12 in favor and that in
the Executive Committee of the
IFC four to one against it.

In a statement accompanying
the proposal when he sent it
back to SG, Dr. Rankin had said
that the voting in IFC showed a
lack of consensus and strong
reservations by the fraternities
about assuming the responsibil-
ity the acceptance of the plan
would entail.

Dr. Rankin in his statement did
not rule out the possibility of ac-
ceptance of the proposal at a later
date should the furthur study by
SG prompt the IFC to accept the
proposal by a greater majority.
Asked to comment on possibility
of such a move Pape remarked,
“unless some of the members
change their minds or the study by
SG looks promising, I do not
think there will be any drastic
changes in the voting when the
issue comes up again.”

The IF president, when pressed
for his own opinion on the matter,
stated that he had given the mat-
ter much thought and did have a
definite opinion-, but that he did.

The presentation is made yearly
by the staff of Duke University’s\
Parapsychology Laboratory. T h e
paper describing the experiment
is titled “Fantasy Testing for ESP

and was published in the “Journal
of Psychology” (Vol. 52, 1961, pp.
491-503). .

Represents Extension

Dr. McConnel and Miss Ander-
son say that their research rep-
resents the successful extension of
known ESP technique to a new
situation. 0

The Director of Duke’s Para-
psychology Lab, Dr. J. B. Rhine,
called the experiment “outstand-
ing, first because the psycholog-
ical conditions were specially
designed to arouse the interest
of the subjects; and secondly be-
cause of the care with which the
tste were planned and conduct-
ed.”

Associate research professor in
Biophysics, Dr. McConnel co-au-
thored the book “ESP and Per-
sonality Patterns” with Dr. Ger-
trude Schmeidler. He has served
on the Parapsychological Associ-
ation’s Council ‘since its founding
in 1957 and was its first president.

Currently president of the asso-
ciation, Miss Anderson has also
served on its council since 1957.

ate in Education this year. ’

6500 Expected
For Spring Term‘,

Richard C. Hodges, director of
the Student Records Office, said
that approximately 6,500 invoices
have been issued for the spring
trimester this year; of these about
3,850 have been processed and
cleared, and another 2,000 which
came by mail are awaiting action.

The ﬁnal tabulation of, spring

trimester returns will not be avail-
able for another week but from
all indications it seems that this

year there will be more students,

than in the past years. Last year
there were about 5,400 students
in the spring trimester and in
-1960 there were 5,026.

A spols ..man from the Dean of
Men’s office said that to date some
90 men have applied for and have
been assigned rooms. The Dean
of Women’s ofﬁce added that about
180 undergraduate and graduate
women will stay in the Dormitory.
Last ‘year about 110 men and 125

  Radio -In terference 

A hesitant outlook toward student affairs at the Uni-

A versity is evident in one of several recommendations made
by the advisory board studying radio station WPGH’s bud-

get request.

WPGH, an entirely student initiated, organized and

‘staffed endeavor, has asked for a $15,000 allotment from

student funds to help develop a station worthy of repre-
senting the University of Pittsburgh. 0

A The board has approved the advertising request; it is
recommending that the University grant the $15,000. Both
moves imply endorsement of WPGH’s accomplishments so
far. ‘ A A

But the board must feel some reservation in their en-
dorsement, for they have also suggested that a full—time,
salaried advisor be appointed to oversee this “student” acti-
vity. Because theiadministrative detailsincurred by an
operation the size and scope of a closed—circuit radio station,

- even at this University, cannot possiblyloccupy all the time

of a person working a 40 hour week, this “advisor’_’g will also
assume some management of WPGH’s operational and tech-

nical functions.

Evidently the students behind the station have done
well by themselves up to. the point where a sizeable.allot-
ment is justified, but the board feels they would be incap-

, table of handling an expanded program.

rOth~er schools maintain affiliated radio stations with
considerably more than one salaried person supervising—--
Duquesne University is an example——but they do not tout
them as student ventures. Still other schools——Dartmouth
and many of the ivy leaguers are among these——have char-

tered their stations as separate corporations. These are in-

dependent student organizations.

As precedent for their recommendation, the advisory

board points to the William Pitt DebatingUnion with its

full-time chairman. Radio broadcasting, they ‘maintain, is
an outgrowth of public speaking, and the speech department
has chosen the salaried—manager road. But the director of

(Student Publications, two other student groups and the
‘WPGH staff themselves, feel that their activity is of a’
journalistic nature. The director of Student Publications has V

offered his services; Pi Delta Epsilon, honorary journalism
fraternity, has recognized WPGH as falling under their
jurisdiction and the Student Union Board plans to consider
them as a publication whenthey determine Union office
assignments; members of the station’s staff have expressed
willingness to operate on the same basis as publications.

At its dedication in January, Chancellor Litchfield ask-
ed that WPGH provide a “flexible means’ of faculty-student-

’ administration communication” and hailed it as “a major

step forward.” Supervision of the sort that the advisory
board has recommended may well harden vericose arteries

April, April, delicious April. This is that magic
time of year when University students finally de-
cide what to do with their summers: remain for
the third term or go to Europe. Travelling abroad
has become one of the most de-
sirable activities of American
youth; it is ‘stimulating, broad-

and expensive as hell.

from dribbling across the Channel into England,
although this was attempted in the latest World
War. The inhabitants of France‘ are called. the
French, but in olden times, before they became
prosperous, they were referred to as the Franks,
due to their long; lean shapes.

Popular Adiecfive

The French have contributed much to what we
take for gran.ted as being Americana; Note the
popularity of the adjective French in the fore-
front of such terms as: pastries, fries, salad d:ess-
ing, sheets, cuffs and kissing. ~ ’

Most charming of all French culture is the
language‘. Although it is necessary to have‘ an over-
sized nose with no nostrilsto speak the tongue,

understanding French is no _problem. Only two,’

terms need be mastered for communication pur-
poses: n’est-ce pas (pronounced “ness paw”), which

i is used by all Frenchmen, and oui (pronounced

“oui”), which is used by all Frenchwomen; All
other French terms are of little importance, since

 

By Matthew Nesvisky —---V

they are used only by waiters and politicians.

Now that the tongue has been mastered, let us 

enter the heart of France, Paris. Long hailed as a
cultural center of the world, this Capital city still
retains a great deal of Old World charm. See the
quaint little old ladies as they peddle flowers in

the crooked streets! See the crooked little, old 
men as they peddle snappy postcards to the tourists!

See Paris, center of culture!
The culture-oriented French have given many

great people to the world, in the past as well as the —

present. In history we can find Rene Descartes,-
who didn’t believe that anything was real, and
jolly old Voltaire, who preached that they more
real things were the better they were.

tooth (for cake) led to a cavity which stretched

all the way down (to her neck. . I _ 

Today, the French have Charles DeGaul1e who,
aside from being President (no accomplishment

 

We can 0
also find the tragic Marie Antoinette, whose sweet

 

since French law states that all Frenchmen must H i

take the position), is noted for being the only man

in the world who has ever attempted to conceali

a NATO submarine base in the middle of his kisser.
The French have also given the world Brigette
Bardot, whose parents recently received the Nobel
Prize for Architecture.
Creativity Plows

France is also noted for being a fountainhead
of great creative people, such as Cezanne, Renoir,
Hugo, Dumas and Pasteur. Occasionally they goof
and come up with a Maurice Chevrolet, but this
should not be held against them.

Much of France retains its slow, Old World
customs of guzzling wine, chasing each other’s
wives and. tying balloons onto Renaults, but all is
notlwell with this nation. The fact that the French-
men in Algeria demand that that country should
remain French while DeGaulle says it should—-
that is, since the Secret Army kills Moslems be-
cause the homeland feels the Arabs are entitled—-
that is, since the colonists want——

Outsider States View
On Alcohol lssue

Editor, The Pitt News:
Recently while riding on the

streetcar, I found a discarded

copy of The~Pitt News. ‘I was

startled to ﬁnd an article con-,

cerning a close vote among fra-
ternities on the issue of allowing
drinking in their houses during

, social functions.

My surprise stemmed mainly
from the fact that I had assumed
that it was not only allowed but
encouraged.i As a private citizen
I had occasion to visit Oakland
several -times during the spring
trimester and came in contact
with the outsides of several fra-
ternity houses where these social
functions were being held. The
noise was clearly audible a block
away and it was not the kind of
noise produced by Sunday school
punch. I -

Also, I wonder if ‘putting a ,

ladder against the side of a pri-
vate home and annoying the oc-
cupants in the wee hours in such
a persistent manner that they
were required to call the police
in self defense was a sane, sober
and intellectual act.

If the moral conscience of the
University is such that they feel
they must make these riots legal,
then make them legal, but don’t
kid yourselves about something

‘that is all»too clear to anyone

with normal vision and hearing.

Presentation Made

To Every President

The books in the big display
windows of the University Book
center are representative of the

collection which the American
Booksellers Association presented '0

to the White House Library in
1961.  V

Idea of the display, according to
Paul Boltacz, general manager of
the‘Center,iis to arouse students’
interest and make them take stock
of their own libraries in compari-
son. ~

Two hundred volumes were
selected by a committee from the
American Booksellers Association
and represent the best or most sig-
niﬁcent books published in.Amer-
ica in the last four years, accord-
ing to Boltacz. In the words of the

Association: “The books have to A

be signiﬁcant, yet not overspecial-
izedg readable, yet not conﬁned to
the popular . . There must be
books for children.” '

Old Custom

The custom of presenting books »

to the “home library” of the
White House began in 1929 under
the presidency of Herbert Hoover.
California bookseller, John Ho-
well, heard of the lack of books in
the White House and felt that it
should have a ' more permanent

library than just the books brought»

in and taken out by the individual
presidents.

According to Dr. Eaton, the Is-

has taken place in the prison sys-

CRAM COURSE No. 3: ENGLISH POETRY

Final exams will soon be upon us. This is no time for fun and
games. Let us instead study hard, cram ﬁercely, prepare assidu-
ously. I

In this column today let us make a quick survey of..English
poetry. VVhen we speak of English poetry, we are, of course,
speaking of Byron, Shelley, and Keats. Some say that of the
three, Keats was the most talented. It is true that he displayed
his gifts earlier than the others. While still a schoolboy at St.
Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines: '

If I am good, I get an apple,

So I don’t whistle in the chapel. I «

From this distinguished beginning, he went on to write an-
other 40,000 poems in his lifetime—-which is all the more
remarkable when you consider that he was only ﬁve feet tall!

I mention this fact only to show that physical problems never
keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for example, was
lame. Shelley had an ingrown hair. Nonetheless, these three
titans of literature turned out a veritable torrent of romantic

)et.r .

pl l\lol', did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for /dipping Elizabeth
Barrett’s pigtails in an inkwell. He thereupon left England to
ﬁght in the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evidenced by

$5600 Grant
Awarded to Study

Cancer Structure

Dr. Edward M. Arnett, associate
professor of Chemistry at the Uni-
versity, has been awarded a $5600
grant by the National Cancer In-
stitute to continue a study of the
structure of cancers.

The project to be undertaken by
Dr. Arnett will seek to determine
the cause of cancer through a
deliberate distortion of the elec-
tronic structures of molecules.

Dr. Arnett received the A. B.,
M.S., and Ph. D. degrees from the
University of Pennsylvania. He
taught at Western Maryland Col-
lege, and is a former research di-
rector for Max Levy and Com-
pany in Philadelphia. He was a re-

How splendid it is to ﬁght for the Greek,

But I don’t enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek.

While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley remained in England,
where he became court poet to the Duke of Marlborough. (It
is interesting to note in passing that Marlborough was the origi- ‘
nal spelling of Marlboro Cigarettes, but the makers were unable
to get the entire word on the package. With characteristic in-
genuity they cleverly lopped off the final “gh”. This, of course,
left them with a “gh” lying around the factory. They looked
for some place to put it and ﬁnally decided to give it to the
Director of Sales, Mr. Vincent Van Go. This had a. rather curious
result. As plain Van Go, he had been a crackerjack director of
sales, but once he became Van Gogh, he felt a mysterious,
irresistible urge to paint. He resigned from the Company and
became an artist. It did not work out too well. When Van Gogh
learned what a. great success Marlboro Cigarettes quickly be-
came-—as, of course, they had to with» such a ﬂavorful ﬂavor,
such a ﬁlterful ﬁlter, such a. ﬂip—top box, such a soft pack-he
was so upset about leaving the ﬁrm that he cut off his ear in a.
ﬁt of chagrin .)

But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Italy and Shelley in

England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to grow. Who
does not remember his wistful lyric:

A llltotugh I am only five feet high,

Some day I will look in an elephatnfs eye. ,

But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This too
failed. Then Byron, ever theladies’ man, took up with Lucrezia.
Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, a.nd Annie Oakley. Shelley, a more
domestic type, stayed home with his wife Mary, and wrote his
'l’a.mous poem:

I love to  home with the nzissus and write,

And hug her and kiss her and give her a bile. .

Mary Shelley ﬁnally got so tired of being bitten that she went
into another room and wrote Frankenstein. Upon reading the
manuscript, Shelley and» Byron got so scared they immediately
booked passage home to England. Keats tried to go too, but
he was so small that the clerk at the steamship oﬁice couldn’t
see him over the top of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome ,
and died of 9. broken heart.

Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together composed
this immortal epitaph: ’

Good old Keats, he might have been short,

But he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.

Mitters Win~Two, Lose
One On New York Trip

By BOB

SMIZIK

A weekend trip to New York saw the Panther Baseball
team come up with two wins and a loss to boost their overall

season record to 5-5. Against collegiate competition the cats

hold a mediocre 3-4 card. They will try and better this mark

this afternoon against California State at Forbes Field.
The journey to New York saw the imitters defeat Col-

gate, 10-5, and split a double-% A

header with Syracuse, losing the
opener 13-6, but rallying to win
the nightcap, 8-5.

Southpaw John Carlisle was the
winning pitcher
in both con-
t e s t s. Against
Colgate C a r 1-
isle went sev-
en innings and
was relieved by
H a r r y K a n e
who hurled hit-

frames.

Trailing 5 - 4

Jim Sylvis going into the
ﬁnal two innings against the Red
Raiders the Panthers struck for two
tallies in the eighth and four more
in the ninth. Leading the asault
was a newcomer to the lineup,
third baseman Paul Martha, who
smashed out a three-run double
in the ninth.

Martha and sophomore Ron
Supansic hadjust become eligible
to participate and Coach Bobby
Lewis was quick to put their tal-
ents to work. Martha took over for

 

.. Howie Mallet and Supansic took

over Corky Cuthbert’s second base
spot with Cuthbert moving to right
ﬁeld and sending Ray Barton to
the bench.

In the ﬁrst game against Syra-
cuse the Pitt moundsmen were no
match for the Syracuse hitters.
Lashing out 13 hits, including a
home run by football quarterback
Bob Lelli, the. Orangemen more
than doubled the Panther’s run
production. Al Ricciuti cracked a
home run and drove in a pair of
runs while Supansic put three
teammates across the plate.

In the second game Lewis pick-
ed his pinch hitters with uueering

. accuracy to pull out the win. In

the sixth inning when the Cats
‘tied the score at 5-5, it was pinch-
hitters Jim Yedlicka and Barry
Wetzel that drove in all three of
the runs.

In the seventh and ﬁnal inning,
Ray Barton, who had pinch—run
for Yedlicka the previous inning,
drove in two big runs to secure the
win.

‘After Jim Sylvis and Ralph
Shutterly pitched the opening ﬁve
innings Carlisle came in to strike
out ﬁve of the six Orangemen to
face him, to get the win.

The Panther netmen suffer-
ed their third loss by the score
of 5-4 at Kent State over the
week-end. Joe Brown defeat-

ed Kent State captain Paul

to 3-1 in singles play. Bill Hinkel
is now 1-3. Their defeat as doubles

Ralph Mason
upped his record to 3-1, but he
and Pete Nycum, who holds an 0-3
mark in singles, lost their fourth
doubles match. Overall, the team
is now 1-3.

Over the holiday between
trimesters, the netmen had reg-
istered a win at Bucknell while
meeting defeat at the hands of
Penn State and Ohio University
by the score, again, of 5-4. Paul

Five Suspended Players Return

Five football players who were suspended from the University
for a trimester were readmitted this term. Paul Martha, Bob Ostrosky,
Jon Botula, Ray Conway and, Glenn Lehner all reported to school

Thursday.

Carmen Ronca chose not to return to school. He was involved
in the same misdemeanor as the rest. Martha‘s ﬁrst classroom session
took place today as he was on the road with the baseball team at
Colgate and Syracuse. He is ﬁrst-string third baseman.

The football coaches also de-
sire his presence at the right
halfback slot. His absence _in
spring drills was keenly felt.
Besides Martha the rest of the
returning gridders 'took in the
spring intra-squad football game
Saturday. Of the ‘ lot Ostrosky
saw the most action last year be-
sides Martha. He was second-
string tackle. ,
Lehner saw considerable action
at the safety position on defense.
Botula played only a few min-
utes, and Conway’ W35 ‘Ted’

Half-Mile Relay Team Fifth In

Penn Relays Track Carnival

The Panther track team was in the Penn Relays Satur-
day, i.e., according to the entry list.
By the way, they took a fifth place in the 880-yard relay.

That’s all !

A quartet of Vance Carter, Joe Friend, Steve Muriter and
Bob Shanefelt were the only Panthers evident.

Shine Dim

A week before, they were some-
what better in the Ohio Relays,
a meet of lesser consequences and
slower runners. In this they cop-
ped second place in the mile re-
lay behind Purdue, a lesser light
in the collegiate track world. And
Pitt ﬁnished fourth in the 880
yard relay.

The day before that grand ex-
hibition the Panthers lost to,
Miami of Ohio, a team which
embarassel the basketball team
as well in the winter.

Ron Weirs broke the Stadium
pole vault mark before friends
and relatives (in vast Pitt Stadium,
by clearing 14 feet. Al Thomassy
broke his toe on the‘ Cathedral
stairway a few days before,_ and
the Cats got shutout in, the shot
put. and discus, one —time fortes
of the team.

Friend Stars

Joe Friend, an enigma on a poor
team, saved face by winning three
events. He streaked to wins in
both hurdle, events, and broad
jumped _22’—73/4”. He did not
anchor a triumphant -mile relay
team as reported in a Downtown
newspaper.

The Redskins, the victory
safely in storage, conceded the
event to the downtraught losers.
It was their first merciful act of
the day.

Vance Carter also redeemed the

forces somewhat. Pumping hard‘

with his long-legged stride, he

seized the quarter and half mile
runs with his exciting ﬂuid-motion
in the stretch.
No Jumpers
No third place was given in the
high jump as the Cats had no
physically able entrant.. Stepping
over a fallen bar would have al-
most been sufficient, but there
were no pole vaults handy.
There were not enough people
in the stands anyway. So a vic-
tory would not have created
much of a ruckus either. So
why should a loss.

There are some good men on
the track team, none on a national
basis. But track is mainly a team
event. This is where Pitt flops at
the tape.

Cox’s Absence
Alarming In

Blue-White Tilt

The annual spring football
game marks the end of the
beginning.

Beginning now the Panther
gridders shall strive to keep
their sparkling enthusiasm
which they generated in the
spring trials at a razor-sharp edge
over the hot summer months
ahead. '

Saturday’s super-scoring proved
one thing for sure -- the team is
going to direly miss a scorerthis
fall. Illogical? No, for Fred Cox,
the ace of the square-toed troup,
is gone. The mayhem on Saturday
saw three errant boots richochet
of}? potential blocking backs.

Kicking Faculty

Despite the 42-0 shellacking
which the varsity-studded Blue
team inflicted on the upstart
White group, the kicking was mis-
erable.

One good result was the esta-
blishment of Jim Traﬁcant as
the quarterback to unseat. Run-
ning and Passing with equal
dexterity. “Jimbo" paced the
first-string to its dynamic win.
Coach John Michelosen was
pleased with Traﬁcant.’s perform-
ance, and noted many other nice
aspects of _play, also some night-
marish play. “This team will have
much more experience than the
one we started last year with,” he
conceded, “and even last year we
would’ve been better with Trail-

cant in the line-up from the start.”

Ends Impressive

A questionable end corps exhib-
ited some tell-tale signs that Coach
Ernie Hefferle’s magic is rubbing
off already. Bill Howley, Ken Esk-
ridge, Al Grigaliunas, John Jen-
kins, Steve Mizerak and Bob Long
were impressive, and caught some
tricky throws.

Ray Pom! was outstanding in
the line, and Ed Adamchick and
Gary Kaltenbach and Tom
Brown were just as good. Popp
may be groomed into a lineback-
er of Joe Schmidt’s college cali-
her.

It was the ﬁrst time in a long

time that the varsity asserted its _

Adamchick said that some guys on
his Blue team were sitting around
Friday night, playing cards. in the
dorm, and they got to talking
about the game. They swore they
would eat the Whites up.

EfHead-Hunters’ Play Sadistic

Version of ‘Sacks-on-the-Mills’

By JIM O'BRIEN

_Ernie Hefferle, the prodigal son who strayed from the
Pitt football corporation to coach at Boston College for two
years is safely in the fold again, and his pet euphemism,
“sacks on the mill” is now a vital segment in the Panther’s
repertoire.

The poetic Hefferle once referred to Duke’s defensive
play in a scouting report as being%*
similar to a childhood sadism, in
which all the neighborhood kids

dulged. A shop—worn football
would be tossed into the air, and
one foolhardy soul would snatch
it, circle the lot for five seconds,
then disappear under the mauling
bodies of a score of tacklers.

The spring showing indicated
that the Panthers are going to be
playing “sacks—on—the-mil1” come

September. “Gang-tackling’s the

only way,” cried Bernie LaQuinta,

a burly boy from Mt. Lebanon.
Defensive Cast ~

Taking a cue from Army’s
Paul Deitzel who popularized the
“Chinese Bandits” at LSU, the
Pitt brass are going to mold a

;_l,specialized defensive unit this
year. The Panther version has
been labeled the “Head-Hunters.”

“The real idea,” Coach Frank
Lauterbur said, “is to get as
many kids in the game as pos-
sible. These are third string
kids, and there has to be a badge
for young guys to get the right
attitude, and know their play is
useful.

“Certain boys make good head-
hunters. They have certain skills
and they can be put in a specializ-
ed unit. But they must have a lust

for contact. They've got to want
to take other guys on. Their utopia
,,.is to get in on every gang-tackle.”
May Start

Head Coach John Michelosen
hinted that “they may even start
a game if we’re going to kick off.”
To which Lauterbur added, “And
they’ve got to go down ﬁeld on
kick-offs and put the fear of the
Lord in some people.”

One moose-like fullback who
will profit by the alignment is
Lou Slaby, who faced the in-
surmountable task of overcom-
ing a fullback corps that was
just too imposing. “This sounds
alright,” he said. “Gang-tackh
ing is better because one guy’s
not getting patted on the back

'" {for making each stop.”
“It will discourage the other

teams when they see eight and ten
guys on their ball—carrier’s back.”

LaQuinta says, “We’re just a
bunch of gung-ho guys who should
glue-up the line. The best ‘Head-
Hunter’ is the guy who wants the
most blood out there.”
