DISCUSSION HELD weighing the pros and cons of amnesty.

by KARL BALDYS

The question of- whether or not‘

a commission should be initiated
to ‘study the ..Allegheny County
government, will appear on the
ballot Nov. 7. Jane Thompson, di-
rector of the Citizenship Informa-
tion Center, released, last week, .a
list of candidates for the commis-
sion, and urged voters to pick up

a copy at her office on the third’

floor of the Student Union.

Walter Grady, a senior at Pitt
and a candidate for the commis-
sion, explained what a vote in fav-

or of the study would m ea n .“When

a person votes ‘yes‘ he’s

saying he wants a study of coun-
ty government, a commission that
can recommend changes. How-
ever, a future referendumwill de-
cide if the recommendations of
the study commission will be ac-
cepted.” Grady is the only stu-
dent candidate on the county bal-

._ lot.

The question has been brought
to the November ballot through
the “Home Rule and Optional

Plans Law—Act 62 of the Penn-
sylvania legislature. It permits 10-
cal governments to study their
present structure and present
recommendations to the voter.
Recommendations would be the
adoption of a Home Rule Charter,
the adoption of optional plans pro-
vided for in Act 62, or no change.

Under Home Rule, decisions on
spending could be made without
approaching the state legislature.

’ At present, if the county decides

to put in new street lights it must
first ask permission from Harris-
burg. Home Rule would not give
the county added powers of tax-
ation or allow the‘ county to ini-
tiate or suspend services to mun-
icipalities without the consent of
those municipalities.

Donald C. Stone, Dean Emeri-
tus and Professor at the Univer-
sity, termed the present county‘
government,  . something from
about the ninth century A.D.” He
claimed that local governments
were. being manipulated by,state

To Aid in Student Problems

‘I.’

S.G. Committee Formed

i by JAMES WHIPPLE

The Student Government Re-
search Committee, the newly-

formed SG committee, will soon

be electing a chairman. The main
objective of the group is to look
into problems that the other three
SG committees have no jurisdic-
tion over. ‘

Dave Bluey, one of the Student

‘government Board members,
ame up with the idea for the

committee, after he realized that
the Board could not look at every
problem that Pitt incures on a
daily basis.

Students who have personal
problems that could not be cov-
ered by one of the standing com-
mittees will be able to go to the
research group to get help with
their problems. An example ,of
this would be if the student was
having personal problems with
one of their professors and did not

The Research Committeewould
be available to the administration

' as well as the students. So far 24

people have applied for this com-
mittee. Every one who is inter-
ested may apply.

Bluey said, “I beleive this is an
up and coming committee and
that it could eventually evolve into
the most important the Student
Government has,”

  Panel Discusses Amnesty

* by RALPH DEAN

Obvious student apathy limited
to about 50 the number of persons
who attended the Student Union
Board “Panel Discussion on Am-
nesty” Monday in the Union Ball-
room. The discussion consisted

‘j_ primarily of pre—planned volleys
» from the audience and the mem-

bers of thepanel, and failed to es-
tablish a framework for argu-
mentative exchange.

Dr. Hal Reed argued for a “log-
ical, legal handling” of the ques-
tion of pardon for draft evaders

legislators. “The present system
provides a way that individual
legislators can control things on
the county level.”

Stone said, “An example of
what can be done by charter revi-
sion is to provide Allegheny Coun-
ty with a genuine legislative or-
gan. For the first time it could

‘have a body of whatever size ,is

needed-to represent adequately its
1,605,016 first class citizens.”-

Little opposition has been lev-
eled at the study commission con-
cept. According to Stone, “The
only criticism has been that it

might cost more. However, the-

county would be ten times more
effective than it is now.”

Walt Grady emphasized that

the candidates were all 'non—parti- ‘
no party affiliations '

san, i.e.,
would be printed on the voting
machines. However, both parties
have sponsored candidates. The

only requirement, aside from res-

idency, to get on the ballot, is a
petition with 200 signatures.

The City of Pittsburgh and 33 lo-
cal municipalities will consider
demmission studies of their in-
dividual structures. Some will

vote on Home Rule, others the ‘

optional plans alone, and some
will consider both. Voters are
urged to contact the Citizenship
Information Center to understand
their individual options.

Grady noted that he was also
running in Mt. Lebanon, along
with Michael Flannegan, another
Pitt student. “It’s funny, but Mike
and I are second and third on the
ballot in Mt. Lebanon, but I’m on
lever 33b in the county. I guess
that’s politics.” Positions on the
ballot were chosen by lot.

/Daniel Ellsberg Due
To Speak At Duquesne

Daniel Ellsberg will be the featured speaker at a public meeting
Nov. 1, 8 p.m., at the Duquesne University Student Union Ballroom.

Dr. Ellsberg was strategic analyst at the RAND Corporation and
a consultant to the Department’ of Defense from 1959 to 1964. After he
returned to RAND, in 1967, he began work on the McNamara" study of
U.S. decision-making in -Vietnam, now known as the Pentagon Papers.

Following the publication of the Pentagoh Papers in the New York

and military _deserters, while his
partner in the discussion,'Major
John Brent, Jr. spent much of his
time tr'y7ing'to refute ,the moral
objections to the war in Vietnam
which were presented by Willard

Mead and Dean Elder. ‘

Mead and Elder favored uncon-
ditional amnesty, while ‘ Major
Brent and Reed seemed to prefer
a “case-by-case” analysis and at-
tempted to prove that an histori-
cal precedent for this exists.

Following a brief opening state-
ment from each panel member,
the discussion seemed to drift into

«what one person present called

“cliches one could find anywhere”
about wartime atrocities and
methods and military initiative. _

The panelists could not agree
upon the number of people involv-
ed in the amnesty issue.

Reed cited 22,000 such cases.
Mead insisted that there are clos-
er to 400,000. Negative arguments

Further alternatives, such as the
proposal to draft “exiles” into

were generally ignored. - 

The concluding question and an§_

Brent and Reed attemptingto ‘ain-

the pro-amnesty audience. During?
that session, a man who identified
himself as a Vietnam, veteran
called for an end for all heated ar-.;

Proposed Merger of Schools Causes Conflict

‘by MONICA cmocco

A special colloquium for stu-
dents in' the Graduate School of
Library and Information Science
was held October 26.
The purpose of the meeting was
to discuss the proposed merger of
interdisciplinary Doc-

tlDIS), and Educational Com-
munications.

John Forsman, a member of the

f. _ GSLIS Senate, opened the meet-

ing by informing the students

 about the history of the proposed
I merger—15-12, and 14-10. He em-

Home or Office ~

phasized that at a meeting of the
Reorganization Committee, Pro-
vost Rhoten Smith confirmed that
Educational Communications
would be given the first and sec-
ond floors of the LIS Building;
promised GSLIS would not lose
their library. and any discussion
on changes would include the
GSLIS administration. _ -
However, Mr. Forsman contend-
ed that despite these promises
independent actions were being
taken and the GSLIS administra-
tion and faculty were not includ-
ed in any discussions or even

consulted. Furthermore, he stated

'cussions of

that there is no proof that any
benefits would result from a mer-
ger: infact, no new classes or
faculty would be available to the
students, GSLIS would lose space,
and the library would have to. be
changed.

“Our objective is to educate
and train librarians for the profes-
sions; this is not the objective
of the other two departments," Mr.
Forsman said. A

He concluded by stating that a
resolution, signed by the faculty,
to discontinue any further dis-
unification. would
be voted on by the GSLIS Sen-
ate, October 27.

Mr. J. Phillip lmmroth rep-
resented P_rovost Smith at the"

‘Collequium Discusses

meeting. He informed the stu-
dents of the following informa-
tion: _

O . First.
has

the Buhl Foundation
funded a small grant pro-

posal for an outside visiting team t

to review the proposed unifica-
tion and make recommendations.
Secondly, Educational Communi-
cations has only beenpromised
floors one and two of the LIS-
Building. No decisions on the
remainder of the building have
been make. There will be a space
allocation planning session Octo-
ber 31, and both he and Dean Ses-
sa. head of GSLIS, will be present."

Finally, the Provost is concern-
ed with the resolution being cir-
culated in reference to GSLIS

“Women in the Arts"

discontinuing any further discus-
sions of unification and says
that GSLIS is in a vulnerable posi-
tion from a budgetary point-of-

.view if it continues without the

proposed expansion. The Provost
wishes to make the Graduate
School of Library and Information
Science the best in the nation and
sees the proposed expansion as
one way to do this.

On Friday, Oct. 27, the GSLIS
Senate tabled the resolution to
stop further discussion of unifi-
cation with an amendment added
saying that it would wait until it
reviewed the report funded by the
Buhl foundation. John Forsman
said that at this point. “unifi-
cation is up in the air.”

Womens Studies Offered

(Continued from Page 2)

As a female writer, Kathy Searle presented her ideas about the

field of writing, concentrating on self published works. Writing 
a book about capital punishment, Searle stated that she learned to use , _
. a printing press so she could print her own works. She also explain- 

ed why a woman’ press offers a chance for women writers.

The bulk of Monday’s lecture and discussion was presented by

Landy, who spoke about the history of the epic form, and the writ-
ings of the classic epic writers, Virgil, Homer, and John Milton.

Landy opened by quoting Plato from his essay, “The Equality of J

Women,” where hestates that all occupations should be open to mem-
bers of both sexes. ' ,

In describing the role of women, Landy raised the question of
"why are there no women epic writers if this art form wasan integ
ral part of society."

Landy moved into the realm of the socialization of women and

“how we perceive ourselves." Continuing to question the history of ».
literature, she asked “what is the role of the artist, and how are 

women perceived in this role?" 

John Milton, author of Paradise Lost, was described by Landy as i_ 
. inspiration,” and the male to the »

equating women to the “muse . .
“articulator,” the guardian of the language.”

Landy also stated that "there is a certain equality in all of us 
being trapped.” She continued by saying that innovativeness is .

associated with men, and women are the inspiration.

The idea of creativity and innovation was open ‘to the audience
when Landy described -women as being
(government) corruption."

Landy concluded Monday's discussion by saying “only in the

area of performing. rather than creativity. women have been allow- "

ed to excell."

 It is in the economic realm more
than any other that logic and self-
interest should be pointing to
a; McGovern victory. And yet,
we hear of how people feel
Nixon is more competent in the
management of the economy,
and‘ how George McGovern
changes his rmind too much.

§ -"ago: “My strong point is perform-
ancenl always do more than I

promised, and then see who is

one thing and does another.

“Richard Nixon, in a letter to
__George Meany in 1969, wrote
Tthat "he “would combat infla-

continued, that Richard Nixon
is not as vulnerable as he should
be? Well, as stated. Richard Nixon
clamped wage and. price con-
trols on the economy some four-
teen months ago. Although it was
a frank admission that his econo-
mic policies had failed. it saved
him politically. For on the sur-
face things seem to have improv-
ed. But then’ they almost had to
improve. They had nowhere to go,
after three years of Nixonomics,
but up. Prices have indeed risen
less‘ than pay, but the rate of in-
flation is still 4% for the past year.

But the “price” we have paid
for this modest improvement is
tremendous. Profits for the large
companies have risen dispropor-
tionately. While the Administra-
tion seeks to limit wage increases
above $1.90 an hour, two of its
“special” friends, ITT and Lock-
heed, recorded record sales ,and
profits the first half of this year
according to the Christian Science
Monitor. Mr. Nixon believes that
by stimulating these corporate pro-
fits through tax preferences, that
the benefits will “trickle down”
somehow to the consumer. But
George McGovern puts it squarely
when he says that this policy is
merely one of “giveaways to the
big corporations and takeaways
from the taxpayers.”

The problem is that Richard
Nixon, aside from generalized
pledges, has refused to let him-
self be smoked out on these eco-
nomics subjects. He has yet to
enunciate a tax reform‘ pro-
gram or to say how long he might
continue wage-price controls, or
to indicate what level of unem-
ployment he believes might be
consistent with price stability.
George McGovern, as the pro-
pounder of '_ new ideas, has
thus become the focus of the dis-
cussion instead of Richard Nixon.

But not everyone forgets what
the past four years have been
like. The housewife knows that
prices are still rising, and that

‘steak has almost become a l_uxury

item. The steelworker who has
been laid-off twice in four years
knows that the unemployment
rate is still. high and that, as
The New York Times says, “the
Administration is unduly compla-
cent about so high a level of job-
lessness.” And all of us should by

‘now have the feeling that we’re

being socked by ever higher taxes,
while Mr. Nixon’s rich and pow-
erful frineds, the ones who really
have the ear of the B52 in the
White House, pay next to nothing.

The plain fact of the matter
is that people have momentarily
forgotten how economically diffi-
cult the past four years have been.
Nixon’s economic plans are based
on the same premise as hisvViet-
nam plans: a cynical belief that
the American people are too stu-
pid to look beyond what is imme-
diately in front of them. George
McGovern, the man who would
take an activist lead in aiming

to redistribute income and wealth‘

more equitably among all citi-
zens, puts the economic picture
into sharp focus: “Mr. Nixon ap-
parently believes that the Ameri-
can people will forget four years
of economic failure, if the infla-
tion statistic improves in any one
month. But the. economic set-

backs and mistakes‘ are so dis-
astrous that they cannot no_w.be .

easily? erased ”-  

  

 

Nixonomics Saved    

U.S. Economy

by LYNN J. ALSTADT & MIKE HALEY

College Republicans

In 1969, when the President took office, the American economy
was in an ever-rising inflationary period that had gone unchecked
through the 1960’s. Early in 1969, the administration adopted restrain-
ing policies to deal, with inflation and followed those with an ex-

pansive fiscal and monetary course in 1970. Some progress was,

made. but it was not fast enough. So, on August 15. 1971. President
Nixon took dramatic action to intensify his attack on economic
problems. His new economic policy included: (1) a 90-day freeze on
wages. prices and rents which was followed by.more flexible con-
trols: (2) tax measures to stimulate expansion; (3) suspension of the
convertibility of the dollar into gold and a temporary 10 percent

surcharge on imports.

The Presidents policies. have put the brakes on inflation while
not halting business expansion. A review of recent economic reports
demonstrates that the President’s policies are working.

Inflation is at its lowest level in recent history. The rate of infla-
tion for the third quarter of 1972 was 2.2 per cent. A review of the
inflation rate for the year tends to indicate that inflation has been
brought under control and is leveling off. -

The size of the work force has grown faster under the Nixon
Administration than it grew under any President in the past twenty
years. There are more people working now than ever before. The

jobless rate dropped to 5.5% in September while the total number of.

Americans at work was higher than usual for September.

Personal income has grown under the Nixon Administration.
After-tax weekly earnings of nonfarm_production workers rose by 7.2
percent during the past year. Discounting the rise in inflation gives
the average worker about a 5 percent increase in spending power.

Total industrial production and personal income have displayed.

solid gains. In September industrial production rose six-tenths of

one-percent and personal income rose by an annual rate of $5.7 bil-—

lion. The over-all economy has displayed strong, steady gains this
year. The second quarter of 1972 produced a 9.4 percent increase
and the economy grew at a35.9 percent rate in the third quarter.

Thus, when one looks at the economic policies of President Nixon,
one sees sound programs that are working. When we look at President
Nixon‘s opponent, though, we immediately become confused. Since

George McGovern was nominated by, the Democratid party he has»

been offering a new economic policy every month. However, while
he was in the Senate he never proposed or co—sponsored any economic
proposals. He has changed his mind so much over his economic
policy, that it is diffiult to imagine that he could provide any strong

economic leadership.

President Nixon, on the other hand. has demonstrated decisive
leadership and has produced programs that-are working. The
President has brought the economy under control and the future
looks bright. Based upon the results of the Presidents policies,

financial expert Alan Greenspan forecast

"a maintenance of

strong growth trends for the next year at least." To ensure that
our economy continues, to grow under responsible leadership, reelect

_ the President.

Letters to

Editor, The Pitt News:

In Ronald Brown's most recent
article on medical care, he once
again betrayed his inability to
comprehend the concept _of hu-
man rights. He and Senator Mc-
Govern contend that “the Ameri-
can people have a right to the most
basic human right—decent health
care." (I) But a right to “decent
health care“ per se implies that
someone is obliged to provide it.
And if those capable of providing
decent health care do not offer
their valuable services voluntari-

‘ ly, obviously; Messrs. Brown and
McGovern’s contention logically
commits them to forcing the com-
pliance of members of the medi-
cal profession. In effect, the right
of members of the medical pro-
fession to control their lives is
usurped. One must, therefore. as-
sume that Messrs. Brown and
McGovern have no intention of

’ recognizing the rights of mem-
bers of the medical profession to
their life, their liberty and the
pursuit of their happiness.

The solution to the health care
crisis rests—not in the enslave-
ment of doctors—but in destroy-
ing the AMA‘s‘(government sanc-
tioned) monopolistic barricade.
which forbids the entry of com-
petent competitors into the field
of medicine.

The phenomenon gaining widespread publicity—the Jews as a

a block moving toward support for Nixon because of his support for

lsrael—is indeed a puzzlement to one Jew whose interest in Israel
dates back to a period long before a Democratic President, Harry
Truman, with encouragement from two Democratic stalwarts. Judge
Harry Fisher and Jacob Arvey. recognized the new state.

I have some_ real reservations about Jews making their choice of

candidates based on a one-issue foreign policy position. but to those

who are so influenced, may I say that they have short memories?

ITEM: (It was the Eisenhow-Nixon administration that presented
Israel with a near-ultimatum to withdraw from Suez—a forced ac-
quiescence on Israel’s part that has produced nothing but hostilities
and terrorism. And yet, Secretary of State William Rogers has, on
August 10, reaffirmed as United States policy his 1969 program for
“substantial withdrawal.” V

ITEM: For almost the first three years of the Nixon administra-
tion, before the. 1972 "election and the Russian influence in Egypt
became prime questions.‘ Isarel’s Prime Minister, Golda Meier. and
Foreign Secretary, Abba Eban,. encountered nothing but frustration
in trying vainly to induce the United. States to sell them Phantom
jets. It was not George McGovern. but Nixon and Rogers who were
holding back on the sale of jets in an effort to pressure Israel toward
a committed withdrawal from the new borders, (at the urging of bank-
ers and the oil industry, writes the New York Post.)

ITEM: As the election loomed a little closer and Russian com-
-munism was bpcoming a real threat in the Middle East. the ‘Nixon
administration suddenly became alerted to a policy of apparent all-
'out support for Israel. However, after November 7. the need for a
“Jewish strategy" will be eliminated,‘and with the Russian threat sub-
stantially removed in Egypt, the old Nixon stance on Israel will re-
assert itself. As soon as Sadat determined that Russia would not sup-
port Egypt in all-outfwar, then the obvious step was to evict Russia
,"“-and thus remove Israel’s significance as a bulwark against communism
in the Middle East, which had been the principal motivation for the
Nixon administration’s support of Israel. ’

ITEM: There is ample evidence to indicate that after the election
the Nixon administration will resume its position of imposing the Rog-
ers settlemen.t on Israel. Once the Communist threat has disappear-
ed, a compatibility with 100 million Arabs and the oil concessions
that accompany them will appear more attractive to the administra-

tion than the guarantee of secure borders for Israel.’ In fact. the’

Nixon officials have already been quoted "as saying that “the diminish-
ed Societ pressure in Egypt would produce some strain on the solid
American-Israeli position in the Middle East.”

Israel’s newspaper, HAAARETZ, reports that Assistant, Secretary
of State Joseph. Sisco has already advised Iraeli-Ambassador Yitzhak
Rabin that the Unites States would initiate new diplomatic action
“but not in the imeediate future, not before the _election.” By Janu-
ary, 1973, Secretaryfof State William Rogers and Mr. Sisco will be
politely telling Israel that Sadat made a constructive’ move, and

now it is Israel’s turn to accept “substantial withdrawal.” This is
the imposed settlement in the Middle East which has consistently

been opposed by Senator George McGovern, who has since 1969‘

called for direct negotiations and for the sale or gift of jets to Israel.

There may be reasons to vote for Richard Nixon. but certainly
not on the Israeli issue.

For example, if you can live with what we are doing with napalm
bombs and land devastation, both in South and North Vietnam. and
agree with Nixon that Vietnam is our “finest hour” or. as Vice Presi-
dent Agnew had characterized it,  tremendously successful under-
taking . . . "

And if you see no inconsistency in a policy promoting Commun-
ism by extensive trade agreements with Russia and China (a positive
step), by setting the stage for a Chinese-Japanese alliance. by isolat-
ing. Taiwan and granting China prominent influence in the United
Nations, while at the same time trying to stop the spread of Com-
munism by massacring innocent people in Vietnam (supposedly to
preventa massacre). . .' -

And if you deem it an act of statesmanship to have extricated
Russia from a disastrous harvest by the sale of corn and wheat on
favorable credits at the expense of the American taxpayer and thereby

. to enrich U. S. grain dealers ‘(thanks to advance information and spe-

cial subsidies) and yet not bargain for any concessions to protect the

- human rights of SOVIET Jews and other minorities. . . .

‘And if you feel you can trust Richard Nixon after matching his
1968 campaign promises with his actual record on war, crime, infla-
tion, budget deficits, price and wage controls, jawboning, civil rights;
indeed, if you likea President who can so gracefully "rise above prin-
ciples“ (which candidate is the inconsistent one? ). . . ' ‘

And if you feel that tax shelters are the exclusive domain of the
man who earns his money without working for it, be they in the form
of excessive oil depletion allowances, or big business tax writeoffs
(shades of Nixon’s "work ethics"). . . -

And if you are not bothered byiwire-tapping,electronic surveil-

lance against political adversaries, secret campaign contributions, pro- f
ducing special benefits to bug industries like lT&T, or higher prices '

for the Milk Combine, Berrigan fiascos, the Lavelle cover-up and other
aspects of the Nixon ethic. . .

And if you believe that the welfare _recpient is a lazy freeloader
while Lockheed, and ‘Pennsylvania Railroad deserve our tax dollars. . .

And if you insist that the next two or three vacancies in the Su-
preme Court should be filled by ‘men who look and sound like Cars-
well and whose influence on the nation would be felt for decades
after Nixon fades away (and what happened to that Nimon campaign
promise to seek out another Cardozo. Brandeis or Frankfurter? ). . .

But to vote for Nixon on the issue of Israel—no way.‘.’l‘hat would
be an act of such misplaced confidence that it’would suggest a state
of retrograde amnesia—and that is hardly characteristic of the Amer-

) can voter of whatever ethnic group. -

Gays Discuss Love,‘
Marriage, Freedom

by SHARON SEXTON
News Editor
Society’s attitude toward homo-
sexuality is changing as aware-

- ness of the issue increases. This

change is reflected in the proli-
feration or organizations of gays
which have formed for the pur-
pose of initiating social and po-
litical changes which will enable
gays to live more happily and nat-
urally with their alternative life
style. I

One such organization was rec-
ognized by Student Government
last week. Gay Students at Pitt is
a group of approximately 25 grad-
uate and undergraduate students.

The following is a conversation
with several members of Gay Stu-

dents at Pitt which attempts to"

explore how they feel about being
gay, how their parents and friends
have reacted, and how they ,think
they can best revolutionize peo-
ples’ thinking so that their homo-
sexuality canlcome to be accept-
ed as the natural experience

‘-5- which they feel it is.

  

I you can’t genera_lize._‘_ ,

’ Several ‘names used in the in-
terview are fictitious. 

Sexton: Why do you prefer the
term "gay” to homosexual, and
where did the term come from?

Chuck: Why do blackpeople call
themselves black and not negro?

Sexton: Well, for fairly obvious
reasons, they have black skin. I
don’t think the rational behind

b your use of'the word “gay" is

quite as obvious. . _
Chuck: Homosexual is compar-

able ,to'_ nigger. or kike in our eyes.

Homosexual is a clinical, term and

we’re, supposed to.be sick, neuro- .

tic, and rotting, and guilty, as-

7 hamed—not- happy with ourselves. _
“Gay” is a word‘ whichiwe chose” I '

for ourselves as being joyous,
proud and happy.  . . -

‘Sharon: Where ‘ididjn the "word:
‘come from? Is it new? —

Beth: .No, it isn’t  It,waS,
used in the 1800’s in England.

Carol: It's been used" under-
ground foralong time.- I = '

Sharon: How many gays would‘.
you say-there are at Pitt? ‘

Chuck: , A lot more than you
probably realize. Probably about-
10 per cent ofthe student body.

Sharon: If we c_an'talk on a more.
personal level for a _.while——wha't

kinds of adjustment problems did: '

you have, what ithoughtsipassed

through your head when you began’
to be aware that you were gay? '

John: First you worry about,

parents, how relatives were go--
ing to take it. -And then you think
the things that everyone is taught,
you’re supposed to.think — you
go through this stage of reacting
to the stereotype. But soon you

realize that the stereotype is a I

lie, it doesn’t exist, and you stop '

worrying. '
Mick: There is a tremendous

amount of socialpressure. It's an

extremely traumatic experience.’

Chuck: When you first come to
the realization that you’re gay,
if you hear enough negative things
you begin to believe them. I think
that’s what held black people
back for so long. They believed
the stereotype. They accepted it.
I think people often ‘believe what
they hear about themselves until
they can look at it somewhat in-
telligently and see that it is rot.

Sharon:_ The recognition that
you are gay, did it come about as
the «result of one particular 'ex-
perience, or did it evolve from a
long series I of distinct exper-
iences.' _ .

,Mick:' It’s usu’ally".gr’a‘dual, but

  

Chuck: The first time I heard
the word “homosexual” was when
I was going into junior high

school, seventh grade. I identified 0

with it immediately. I had love
feelings for men, and I knew that
I was a “homosexual.”

Beth: Whereas in my case I
never even considered it. I-adop.t-
ed all of society's stereotypes and
restrictions against it, and
thought it was disgusting and aw-
ful. Then I happened to fall in love
with a woman. I consider myself
an intellectual and .a liberal and I
was able to rejectthe sterotype.
But it wasn’t like from adoles-
cense I knew that I wasn’t like
everyone else.

Sharon: What kind of reaction

‘did your friends take to the news?

Chuck: My friends accepted it
really well.

John: They really couldn’t have
been your friends if knowing that
you were gay changed their feel-
ings.

Beth: It really didn’t matter to
any of my close friends. It’s hard
to say how anyone’s parents’

would react. If your parents re-

gard you as a possession then
they’ll probably throw: you out. If

they regard you as a human be- ‘ ‘

ing—‘they’ll try to accept it.

Carol: A pretty’ common: reac-
tion, especially from mothers, is
"where did I go wrong." A

John: If they are ‘fairly liberal
they’ll probably be a shock~per-
iod, but they come to terms with

I itiin the end. You usually find that

parents and brothers and sisters‘
are closer to you after you’ve told
them..

Carol; “I’ve had no negative»

. “GAY IS a-mun loving a man and -
. a woman loving a woman.”

feedback, of course, I've told peo-,
ple that I thought would be open to

this kind of thing I haven't told‘
any of my friends that I thought

might not be able to accept it.

Sharonil What kind of feelings
do you have for the opposite sex,
indifference? Antagonism? I

Chuck: You look at people as
individuals.

John: You know people‘ as peo- '

ple. I think this is more true for‘
gay people than it is for hetero-
sexual couples. I think it is par-
ticularily difficult for heterosex-
ual males to get to know hetero-
sexual females as people. and not
sex objects.

Beth: One thing that‘s true for
me. it’s easier to like gay men be-
cause you don’t have to play male-
female games with them.

Mick: Also there’s’a big under-/
standing, a strong common bond,

_.between gay peopleiof opposite

SEVERAL GAY students rap during a consciousness raising session.

Sharon: Do you find that your
social life is at all limited because
you’re gay? v

John: It was before the m_ove- .

ment got started. Honestly, you
sit around and look for something

like thisxto "happen if there isn’t
I anything. And it’s ’not just‘ social

because "there is a strength that

goes with it. And-it’.s more than .
, belonging,

i_t’s more than the
Campfire Girl, YWCA sort of be-
longing.; You’ve got people behind
you and you know you are not

I alone. ~

. Mick: AWe’ve gotten together
and gone ‘to public dances and
danced with each .other,~ male

with --male‘, and female with ,fe-.‘

male. It’s'only since the group’

-was formed that we’ve been able’

to ‘do that. '

Sharon: Do you try to monitor.

your behavior in public? If you.

know that you are in amixed
group do you refrain from show-

« ing affection to your partner or

‘lover?

Carl: It’s not surpressed.

Mick: I don’t think we supress,

it in any way. As a group we _don’t
hide it but we don’t flaunt it eithér..

Carl: We are still very careful.

Sharon: When you do display af-
fection in public, what kind of
feedback do you get?

Ellen: You get the stare,«the

double. take, but rarely do you get '

a verbal attack.

‘Sharon’: Does it bother you

f when people. stare?

is inter—racial couples.

Sharon: How does the concept
of fidelity work within a gay re-
lationship? '

Mick: It works the same as it "

doeszwith a heterosexual couple.

If there is a guy that would en-V‘

joy going to bed’ with 1,000 gys—
he does. Or, in /my case, I have
relations with one person, that’s
the person I want to be with and
that’s the person I sleep with.

I would say one thing though, I

think gay couples are a little more ,

liberal in their thinking in regard-
to the idea of one-to-one relation-
ships.‘I think we branch out more
and are -a little more open=mind-

have a relationship and he de-
cides he wants to go out with
somebody else, and I‘m of the

4 same mind, then that’s fine. What

I'm saying is, there is more of
that around with gay couples than
with heterosexual couples. He

»wouldn't have to hide it like he
. would -in ’a heterosexual relation-

ship.

John: However, if you did hide
.it it would be just as destructive
it. it would be .in a heterosexual
relationship.

Beth:'- Gay relationships prob-'

ably tend to be a lot freer than

heterosexual ones. The bond be-.

tween the two people in a gay re-
lationshipis not a legal one.

Carol: Marriage started as a
way of taking a woman out of so-
ciety for one particular man; she
then became his possession.
There is very little of this type of
feeling among gay couples.

. Sharon 2, Whatido you think about
marriage between gays? Is there
any necessity for it?

Carol: Rightﬁnow there is a leg-
al necessity because of things
like inheritance taxes, joint bank
accounts. There is discrimination
against a single person gay or
straight.

Beth: A heterosexual couple

that gets married and doesn’t.

have children is no different than
a gay couple in terms of what they
provide the state. Yet they get

all kindsof tax benefits, inheri-

tance benefits—just about any-
thing. And in addition to allthat,
-society accepts them.

Sharon: Then the only real ne-
cessity for marriage between
gays is a legal one? ’

Beth: Yes.

Sharon: If someone came up to
you today and confided they
thought they were gay, what ad-
vice would you give them? Would
youtell them to see a doctor? To
come to one of your meetings‘?

Carol: First I’d tell them not
I" to worry about it because it’s no_t

as strange as they've been taught a

to believe.

Beth: I wouldn’t want topush
them one way or another, but I
would let them know that there
are alternatives.

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor
Somebody called the Homecom-

, ing ’72 a “Return to Tradition."

which is nothing but a load of pure
agriculture grade bullshit. I look-
ed at the pictures of the girls that
want to be the Homecoming
Queen and then I read what they
had to say for themselves and I
don’t think any of them could be a
a queen even in a very small coun-
try. . ‘
What they all seem to want is to
be a princess without all the trou-
ble of having Pat Nixon for a
mother and some asshole like Ed
Cox or David Eisenhower hang--_
ing around" the house. And the
crop under King LBJ was prob-

ably even worse even if it is hard

to imagine.

If Pm really needs a Queen the .

first thing to do is to get all these
oversize Barbie dolls out of the
running and back doing volunteer
work and being in charge of what-
ever it is that goes on in those
sororities. Then you should open
the nomination to women instead
of girls, like faculty members or
staff women, or the ladies that
work so hard at the cash regis-
ters in the coffee shops. The girls
could run for Princess and you
could elect all of them so nobody
would feel hurt about losing
something they really want.

You probably’ won’t do anything
about this because next year one

of these girls wants to be able to
say “Homecoming Queen” along
with all the other things they
claim to have done and things
they won already.

If we have to have one of these

I girls for a queen, I kind of like

the one that’s weaving herself
into some kind of lap robe with
new colors every year. The one
that changed from adolescence to
womanhood makes me wish I

could have watched or maybe’

helped. But they’re all princess
types. _ I

Maybe you ought to change the
title to Homecoming Queen Moth-
er, then you could get away from

all the princesses. E WHIMSEY.

py they were. I think if people
come out and say, “Here’s an al-
ternative Iife style,” more people
are going to opt for it. A lot of
women I know that say they’re
heterosexual are really lesbians
at heart. -They keep on saying
things that are really gay!

Sharon: What kinds of‘ things
are really gay?

Karen; Well like my sister's
friend was mad at her boyfriend
and she said, “Let‘s the three of
us girls go out tonight and have a
good time." She was saying that

_ you can’t have any fun when the

men are around, only when the
girls are together. ,

Sharon: Is that gay?

Cathy: No. I would disagree‘

with that. I'don’t think beinggay
for women is not liking men. I
think it’s preferring women.

Sharon: What about role play-_

ing in a gay relationship? Does it
exist?

John: Among younger gay peo-

ple role playing has about disap-'

peared. It is usually older gay
couples who have igotitenxinto the
sterotypes that feel there must be
a male, there must be a female.
Gay is a man loving a man, a
woman loving a woman‘.

It’s a new season forthe West-
ern Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Club Hockey Association who

I are picking up where they left off.

The Pitt Hockey Club, defending

‘ champions of the year old

WPICHA, still loom as the team
to be reckoned with.

Pitt made a virtual shambles
ofthe league last year and, with
the majority of the team back
again this fall, are practicing ve-
hemently to reassurrie their posi-
tion when the season starts on
Nov. 11. .

To begin with, the icers have a
pair of new coaches in Tom Mey-
ers and Guy Carole. Meyers saw
action with the Notre Dame hock-

’ e_v team while Carole once skated
with a junior hockey team in Mon-
treal. -

Phil Clarke and John Finney are
the only new faces to break into

the starting lineup. Clarke has

stepped right into a wing position
on the first line while Finney will
fill the skates of defenseman Fred
Wilson, who graduated last year. ‘

Along with Finney, the defense
will consist of Joe Testa, Kerry
Browne. and Duke Shaeffer. Testa
led the team in assists last year
with 12. while Shaeffer was sec-
ond in the league in penalty min-
utes, chalking up 41.

Clarke‘s linemates will be Den-
ny Browne, who was fifth in the
leaguein scoring with 10 goals
and nine assists, and Billy Glan-

-ville, who placed right behind
Browne, scoring nine goals and-

eight assists last year».
The secondline also has plenty
of firing power in Frank Wil-

si......p..pi. D.i..d Crown

liams, Dave Bahnson, and Tom
Lang. Williams led the team in
scoring with 12 goals and nine
assists, which also earned him his
third place in the final league
leaders. Bahnson hit for eight
goals last year while Lang, who
possesses one of the hardest,
quickest wrist shots in the cir-
cuit, lit the red lamp seven times

At Offensive Guard.

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

In the game of football it ’is not unfamiliar for
certain positions .to draw a majority of the atten-
tion—the quarterback and pass receivers. for ex-
ample. are some of football’s more prevalent
"'gloryguys."' V '

Individuals on the offensive line are very sel-
dom singled out for their efforts on the field.

Somehow this fact does not seem to phase

Pitt’s offensive guard Dave Wannstedt in the '

least.

“I haven’t had much ‘ink’ I guess you would
say since I’ve been here at Pitt,” related Wann-
stedt. “But it’s not important. I just go out there
and do my job and hope for the best.’_’ ‘

 - A’   1 The 6-5, 245 pound junior grid-
 der feels that his performance so
far this season has not been upto
par, he feels that he is capable of
performing better.One bright spot,
 however, is that he feels that he
 hasbeen playing_fairly consistent-
 ly, which is something he was un-
 able to accomplish last year.
Wannstedt‘s ambitions are
4 modest-—all he wants to be able to
do is perform his job the best he can. -

“I try to do my job right,” he explained. “The
right people are watching know when you’re doing
your job and when you’re not.__ It’s the coaches and
those type of people who know.”

   

 

iiivANsrlEori if

‘Cl? One of the,people who would know about these

things is the offensive line coach Ernie Hefferle. '

Wannstedt neatly summarized Hefferle's abil-*
ities as a coach when he stated that “the coach
doesn't show much emotion. He says what he has
to and gets his job done. ‘

“He's helped me in the way that when things
don’t go right, he tells you that you just have to
hang in there.”

The Panthers have been tr_ving to hang in_there
all season. Despite their 1-7 record the Pi,tt squad
has done a good job of it according to Wannstedt.

“We just keep plugging away. The attitude has

been realy good considering everythingthat hasn’t _

gone our way,” commented Wannstedt. "Theguys
have really kept their heads up. ‘

“We haven’t gotten the right‘ bre'aks—it’s been

man appears to be only a head
taller than the goal cage, he has
provided Pitt with more than ade-
quate netminding. especially
starring in the championship
game against.Indiana. _

The skaters are currently prac-
ticing twice a week in‘prepara-
tion for the season opener against
St. Vincent College. Although the
WPICHA schedule has not been
made official, Pitt has already set
the dates for two exhibition
games. On Jan. 20 the skaters
will be at University Park to
meet Penn State while on Dec. 8,

other rematch with Gannon Col-
lege. -

Last year. the skaters had to
resort to those exhibition‘ games

for any sort of equal competition."

 Wannsfe’dfNoiGIory Guy I

continued. “But we’ve_ come back every week and
the guys give a hundred per cent.

Although the season so far may not warrant it,
Wannstedt is ver_v optimistic about Pitt’s chances
of defeating West Virginia this Saturday at Pitt
Stadium.

“I feel we can handle West Virginia," he stat-
ed, concerning the Homecoming contest with the
Mountaineers. “Although-we’ve only won one game,
the guys will be up just as much as if they had won
more. '

If the.Panthers do manage to victimize West
Virginia,_ Wannstedt, believes that the closing games
for Pitt will be winning ones for the gridders.

“I’m optimistic. If we beat West Virginia I
feel we can win the rest here on in—beating West
Virginia will give us the'momentum we need,” con-
fided the hopeful gridder.

Contrary to the glamorous build-up job given to_

those who play football, a gridder’s is not always an ‘

easy job nor one that he is lavishly praised for.

But Dave Wannstedt doesn’t seem to mind at‘
all. He's just too busy playing football.

 fans read about this and figure. "Oh well. IleXlL“_t1€‘;_1l' V
will be more of the same for varsity.”,This pessemistic attitude,
begins to pop up in_ the minds of the players. Some facts should 1'
be made clear to both of these groups. ‘ 

Each week during the entire varsity season, the junior var
sity squad simulates the varsity’s opponent for almost the;
whole week. When the jayvees have a game-'this,we‘ek, they re "
main after the varsity and have their own practice two or three:
times for each game. ' "' ‘ i

This is nowhere near enough. The defense, which doesiiftiii
have to worry so much about learning different plays, did al

however, is a different story. The team spends all week in prae
tice pretending it is Notre Dame or Syracuse’s offense. When itff
comes time for their own games, the number of plays they can
execute is quite small. .  .

This improved as the season went on, but against West \'i"i‘
ginia, the opener, it was a big factor in the outcome of the game
Another ‘important skill which can only come with practice 
timing, and when you don’t have timing, you have fumbles. ‘Not
all of the eight fumbles in the Kent State game were caused b_
this, but in that game, one or two could have changed the out
come. ’

Another area which received practically no practice was;

practiced much of the time on his own to be able to kick fie-ldjj
goals, but, once again due to a lack of practice, he didn’t kick"
any because the blocking was unable to keep the opponents outs. 

All of this‘ leads one to examine the purpose of the junior
varsity. "Its purpose is two-fold. First, and most important, it ‘is*‘-
to providethe place for the varsity to turn to when injuries de
plete its ranks. It also initiates the freshman to the style of foot‘
ball that Pitt plays. I —- ' 

As should be clear if you read this far, the jayvee playeij;
aren’t in much shape to step right in and help the varsitiy i
needed. They lack timing and a complete knowledge of the.‘-
plays. These are gradually learned as one moves up to the varsi i
ty. but if pressed into immediate use, the jayvee is unprepared. 

Other schools cope with this problem better than Pitt does

a name coach and clear the
staff of Pitt has beens.
Chas. Turrill

I agree with you whole heart-
edly that any team which al-
lows the clock to run as, to
prevent them from getting
beat too badly should be asham-
ed of itself. And, I am very
sure that the NCAA knows
full well, when these things
take place. But, I.think you
might want to hide your face
a little in view of what hap-

.pened at South Bend this

year.

I am thoroughly convinced
that the last thing on Ara Par-
.segian’s mind was to let the
clock run on incomplete passes.
Pitt, in case you did not listen
to the game, had the Irish on
the run for three quarters of
that game and it wasn’t until
the officials took over by mak-
ing truly absurd calls that the
score grew to misleading pro-
portions, 42-16.

I If anyone. should have been
reprimanded by the NCAA in
that contest it should have been
the officials who made the
outrageous calls or the Notre
Dame people who didn’t mind
it one bit. Don’t'you agree?

Also, I haven’t heard anyone
claiming they had a winning

season -last year with that 3-8
record. And, if the Panthers
drop teams like Notre Dame
and Penn State, will Pitt foot-
ball have any fans? Even
though I wouldn't mind a Rich-
mond or a VMI on the sched-
ule, the only way to reincar-
nate Pitt football is to take the
big time steps which are ne-
cessary—like dropping the Big
Four et la. Unless measures
like these are taken, nothing
else will help either. As far as
hiring a name coach, Pitt al-
ready has. at coach with a
name, Pitt’s coaches name is
Carl DePasqua.

SPORTS EDITOR

After following Pitt football
for the pastgfew years. one
cannot help but notice the

number of injuries which have 2

occurred. Many of the city’s
sports commentators attribute
this to “bad luck." and this
may indeed be true. But why
is it that only Pitt gets half
of its ranks decimated by in-
juries‘?

We fans realize that some
injuries are inevitable through-
out a season but can it be pos-
sible that Pitt’s so—called “bad
luck” may be due to the pos-
sibility that our Panthers. as a
squad. may be inferior in their

  

physical conditioning? No, I
am not going to proceed into
the usual discussion of tdr-
tain players are seen inhabit-

ing. local bars. but I, as well

as many other loyal fans would

like to know how Pitt does stand
in comparison with teams on

its schedule in terms of train-

ing and discipline‘?

Because I am not signing my
name. I realize that this letter
will probably not be published.
But I wish that you. would at
last write a commentary on
this subject. as this is a very
controversial topic. and _vou’d
be discussing something that
the Press and Post-Gazette have
touched on, but have lacked the
guts to talk about. (or just do
not want to stir up trouble ).

Yours, truly,
A Pitt Fan
Dear Pitt Fan.
Like you, I too cannot help
but notice the number of Pitt
injuries, especially this year

where the injuries have been 

of more serious proportions.

You might be glad to know
that the Pitt football players
were in excellent shape this
year at summer camp—accord-
ing .to some observers ‘ there,

the Cats were in the best
shape in some time.

I can’t attribute it to any-
thing else but ‘bad luck.’

Since you didn’t proceed
into the usual discussion about
Panther athletes visiting local
bars, I will. '

Don’t you think that asking
an athlete not to go to bars
is a bit much. After all aren’t
athletes people like you and
me. What’s wrong with an
athlete going into a bar on
a. given night to catch a beer

kg or two. They work hard you

know. True, they have their
tuition paid for to promote
Pitt on Saturday afternoons,
but are they supposed to lock
themselves in the Towers mean-
while. I think it is up to each
individual athlete to deter-
mine for himself the measures
he should take in making sure
he stays fit. I’m sure George
Feher, Paul Felinczak, John
Moss, Lou Cecconi, to men-
tion a few, weren’t boozing it
One
player told me personally that
he had only three beers since
the season began. Besides,
after being batted around by
teams like Notre Dame, a few
drinks go a long way in help-
ing to ease the pain. Like I

said, it’s up to each one to
decide if it will hinder his
performance.

And, I think it too much to
ask coach Carl,DePasqua to
take a bouncer’s job at the
local pubs. Or, for that matter,

to take a job at the Tower’s A

desk to check up on the play-
ers. -

The Panthers are not in in-
ferior physical condition. Each
player has an individual weight
program assigned to him during
the summer and during the
season. If injuries are going to
come, they are going to come.

Even though you did not sign
your name, I agree with you
about being a controversial
topic. There are Pitt followers
that attribute Pitt’s falls to
this very thing. Why,-I had

one Pitt fan tell me that in-

a local bar, while he was
gulping down a pitcher of
beer.

SPORTS EDITOR

Let me_ preface this letter
by telling the readers that I
am a avid sports fan. How-

  R....,,w. G. t...

ever there are many things
which concern me about Pitt’s
sports program. Less than a
hundred football players re-
ceive the attention and money
of the athletic department. Are
we a college or sports fac-
tory? Should we be concerned
about winning games or cre-
ating and instilling coordina-
tion and ideals in the partici-
pants. I suggest that football.
basketball, -baseball etc. be
crafts to be polished for fun
and physical improvement.
by all means. but not a pol-
ishing school for professional
teams.

One or two (percent of the
students at Pitt participate now
in intramural activities. Let's
spend some time and money on
creating two or three hundred
touch football teams. establish-
ing chess tournaments etc., get
the students to participate.
not just be spectators.

At the end of the football
season this year when Pitt most
likely will be 1-10 or 2-9 will

Finally 1et’s stop all schol-
arships based on athletic abil-
ity and give to those students
who need financial aid. Let’s
have an increase in student
participation and abolition of
colleges as sports factories.

Instead of recruiting foot-
ball players let’s recruit and
aid students who want a col-
lege education. When is the
last time you heard of Pitt
begging students with great
grades to come here and paying
their tuition to boot?.

Come on Pitt, dare to be
different, give the sports pro-
gram to the students, let‘sim—
prove all the students not just
a few hundred.

Mike Snyder '
Dear Mike, 72

Now really, you don’t mean
to say that Pitt is a football
factory? Like you said, Pitt
gives out less than one~hund-
red football scholarships. Like

you, I would dread Pitt giving V

out 50 or 60 football scholar-
ships, because like you, I don’t
think that would be congruous
to an academic establishment.

\ If you think Pitt caters to ath-

letes, you would be shocked to
see what happens at other’
schools. Pitt is among the low-.
est schools in giving out schol-
arships. They give out only 25 a
year—very bad for a school that
is committed to a big time foot-
ball program. I would person-
ally like to see Pitt give out

"about ten more scholarships

yearly, for then, the team would
earn enough money‘ to pro-
vide for two hundred intra-
mural football teams. In case
you don’t know, the intramur-
al program is completely fin-

‘ anced by the monies earned by

the football program. ,
If we stop all scholarships,

‘ how can we have so many intra-

mural teams. I think you have
to decide which is more im-
portant in your own mind, as
you tend to bea little ambigu-
ous in your letter.

While you think. we should
concentrate on academic schol-
arships, why can’t we have
academic excellence as well
as a football team. Notre Dame

EDITOR

Apathy and an unawareness
concerning fraternities has led
some to near extinction. Ours
is a case in point. Sigma Delta
Psi is a national honorary ath-
letic fraternity. To qualify
for membership. one must
demonstrate outstanding ath-
letic ability through a series of
tests. We admit the times and
distances are not easy. but
out of the entire student body.
surely there are more than two‘
who can qualify. After we
graduate, will there be none‘? __
We appeal to the athletes to
show themselves and meet the
challenge.

Dear Bob and Jim,

What else can I add. You’ve
said it all. I'm sure there are
more than two people on this _
campus who can qualify for-
Sigma Delta Psi. May I sug-  
gest that you keep sending in  
material to the Pitt News to ’
continually remind prospec-
tive candidates who might
forget.
