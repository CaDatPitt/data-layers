In January. 20 Pitt undergrad-
uates moved into a house on N.
Dithridge Street in Oakland.

There would seem to be nothing
unusual about this, for N. Dith-
ridge is one big line of fraternity
houses and scene of students mov-
ing in was being played all over
the street; except in this one par-
ticular case at 272 N. Dith-
ridge ten of the students were
black and ten white.

These 20 men are the mem-
bers of the L'niversities Intercul-
tural House. They are not guinea
pigs put into a cage to see how
they will ract. but men from all
different social. political. eco-
nomic and religious backgrounds.
who are seeking answers to the
questions: Can different races
live together‘? What are the rea-
sons they are not living together
peacefully‘? What are the mem-
bers of the opposite race really
like‘?

The idea of the Intercultural
House is not the long overused
word. "Integration.“ but is in-
clined more towards "Co-exis-
tance." There are no rules im-
posed on the 20 men. the House is
theirs to do with as they please.
All 20 men decide how the house
is to be ‘run and what things are
right and wrong.

The program is being financed
by the Gertrude Stein Founda-
tion with funds from John Tyler,
a University political science pro-
fessor and his wife, Gabriel. The
house» could be named after the
Tylers for it is their money which
really have made the house a real-
ity. With their money the couple
decided to put it into their dream
of an Intercultural Family.

There were times during the

program when it seemed their

dream bubble was going to burst.
for the blacks in the house and a
few of the whites * suspecting
phony liberalism on the Tyler's
part. and attemps of exploitation
would become aroused. But with

time they found out that the Ty- .

lers were sincere in their dream
come true and were only to be re-
spected.

Choices for membership in the
house. which provides tuition.
room. board and scholarship.
were decided upon by the Tylers
and a- board of directors. which is
composed of interested Pitt offi-
cials. both white and black.

Miscellaneous Things
About the House

The house is modern and is to-
tally remodeled. Dinner is cater-
ed to the members from Saga «yes
they get tired of veal cutlets and
potatoes toot. Two members
share a room. white and black.
because the members wanted it
that way. There is a color televi-
sion and wall—to—wall carpeting.
except in the spacious basement
where the Intercultural
gigs are given. and the ping-pong
table is located. There is always
a supply of breakfast supplies.
which the members cook them-
selves. and they are given meal
tickets for lunch. since most of
them are on campus around noon-
time. There is not official govern-
ment structure. decisions are
made by majority rule. but one
person has the responsibilit_y to
order food from Saga. four people
pay the bills and keep the books.
and one person purchases the
other necessities the members
need.- But the positions are power-
less as such. and the members
who have them volunteered. You
can do anything you want. to in the
house as long as it does not affect
another member adversely. A
graduate student and his wife
have their home on the first floor
of the three story building. They
are there so that the members
may profit from their more broad-
ened experience because of their
slightly older ages. and are an in-
tricate part of the house. One
member is Pakistanian and an-
other Arabian. they have black
roommates.

But back to the ideas surround-
ing the house. Choices for mem-
bership were not made from just
persons who one might consi-
der passive or idealists. Personal-
ities of the ten blacks range from
those bending towards outright
militancy and racism in its es-

sence, to those who don’t really.

“give a damn about whitey, the
American system, or the world,
but just surviving and living the
kinda life I want to live,” as one
black member first put it. Many
of the whites could have been put
into a “slightly redneck” cate-
gory, meaning subtle and maybe
even unknowing racists. And

House .

many were true liberals seeking
answers to the ugly race ques-
tion.

In meetings which the house
members decided they should
have once a week. and a class de-
signed especially for intercultur-
al members under GSPIA. there
were many tense scenes.

There were some fights. and
some violent arguments. but the
20 men had the intelligence to
examine each incident. analize
its meanings. and understand
some of the reasons why they oc-
curred.

The Intercultural House is no
Utopia. The.Tylers and the board
of directors didn’t expect it to be.
The members went into the pro-
gram knowing that it couldn’t be.
The Intercultural House is not

made up of super humanists or ex- _

perimental monkeys, but 20
grown men, to use a proverbial
statement, searching for truth.
The Intercultural runs a little bit
better than the world surrounding
272 N. Dithridge St., because
20 men recognize that they are
20 men.

We are still far from the an-
swers. but damned if -we aren't
closer than a whole bunch of mod-
ern philosophers. We are still sus-
ceptible to the same racial weak-
nesses as anyone else. but at
least were aware of those weak-
nesses. and are searching‘ for a
way to combat them.

Were’ got two guys in ROTC
(only one is turning anti-estab-
lishment). the chairman of Pitt's
Black Action Society. some Wood-
stock men. some Black'Panthers
men. _some Martin Luther King
men. some William F. Buckley
men. and a whole bunch of Easy
Rier. and Manchild in the Prom-
ised Land men. But part of all of
them are in 20 different men.

Two hundredand seventy-two
N. Dithridge St. is our home. We
are a family. We don’t really know
what’s eventually going to come
out of our experience, but one
thing's for damn we are not now,
and we aren't going to be what we
were when we went into the House
and we'll know something good.
Very good.

I The Student Steering Commit-
, "tee (SSC) launched the first of
long months of preparation for
j the Career Seminars at a meet-
. ‘ jing Monday night in 206 SU. About
" 20 students were there to‘ dis-
‘ cuss the program which will be
h heldin the fall.

Tedie Fakles, counselor librar-
 ian and vocation adviser. opened
_ ' ‘the forum by defining the purpose

Q of the job seminars. “Our objec-
'tive," she explained, "is to
’ .acquaint students with the vari-
J ous fields they may enter upon
_. graduation. People from differ-
' jent professions are invited to an-
. Vswer questions that students may
have concerning the _nature of
their work. "

:7Sttidents Investigate Careers

After her brief explanation.
Miss Fakles suggested that the
group be divided into sub-groups
of specific interests. She men-
tioned that four program direc-
tors and a publicity director will
be needed as overseers.

In selecting specialists, the li-
brarian-counselor stressed that
they will be carefully screened.
“Letters,’_’ she said, “will be
written well in advance, and in
some instances, we will insist on
personal interviews.”

"Although the career spokes-
men may seek recruits." Miss
Fakles continued. “their primary
function is to communicate with
the students."

those of last year which were held

Anti-War Flick

 

by JUDY VOLLMER

Some of the "better movies" of
the 60's focused on social com-
_. mentary. including war. racial un-

 A rest. the American economy. and

 international sex. Few of these
movies offered specific or effec-
tive insights. But Suppose They
Gave a War and Nobody Came
pretends to have insights in too
many areas. and it flounders in
every one of them.

 

 

 

Suppose They Gave a War has
about four plots and f'ails to devel-
  op any of them completely. From

._a small town sheriff's hostility to-

‘ward visiting army men. to a
black man's being refused a loan.
to a stilted. fiftyish romance be-
tween Tony Curtis and Suzanne
Pleshette. the film jumps from
A’ theme to theme. leaving the view-
; ers ‘with a jumble of worn out
 messages.
. The most obvious and clearly
‘ j designed theme is the conflict be-
-tween "Old Army" and "New
. Army.“ emphasizing the archaic
structure of the "Old Army" and
,.the “New Army's“ awkward at-
-tempts to improve and polish
community relations with nearby
civilians.

Pathetic, Meaningless

with two completely juiced offi-
cers running the course, another
is the scene of a dance with army
officials and local citizenry try-
ing very hard to tolerate one an-
other. The last scene features a
giant army tank crunching cars
and wildly roaming through a
once peaceful town.

But when you stop laughing. you

realize that the film really was.

pathetic rather than funny. Pathe-
tic. because there was no reason
for the joking. the petty hostility.
or the violence. The whole movie
lacks a reason. and as a result. is
not entertaining.

The acting of Brian Keith and
Ivan Dixon holds segments of the
film together. reflecting a genuine
concern for where the army is go-
ing and what will happen to its
soldiers along the way. The only
other idea that the film clearly
communicates is an interesting
anti-war song at the end of the
movie. as the tank lumbers out of
town. leaving useless destruction
and anger behind.

Asia Scholars

Lobby for Peace

Representatives of over 1.500
Asia scholars met in Washington
Tuesday to urge Congress to end

-the war in Indochina. The unpre-

cedented meeting was attended by
some 200 specialists on East.
Southeast and South Asia. Calling
themselves Asia Scholars to End
the War. they issued a statement
decrying the "ever widening war"
that "destroys Asians and Amer-
cans alike."

The 1,500 signers of the state-
ment come from over 225 uni-
versities in 40 states where Asian
studies are taught. Among them
,were Drs. Zasloff, Singleton and
Yang. They lent their support to
the Hatfield-McGovern Amend-
ment to End the War and other
congressional action to end the
war. I

The scholars signed statement
was presented to Senators Mark
Hatfield. George McGovern. and
Charles Goodell. who accepted it
on behalf of the co-sponsors of the
Amendment to-End the War.

The specialists have also been
meeting with senators and repre-
sentatives. concentrating on those
who have not yet publicly. commit-
ted themselves to any of the con-
gressional measures to end the
war. Anti-war lobb_vists have been
in Washington in unprecedented
numbers in recentweeks. but this
is the first time that a large group
of Far Eastern specialists have
taken part in these activities.

(Editor's Note: The following

authored by two of the environ-
mental leaders on campus.)

by STU KISVILINSKY
and MARC HILLER

Last Thursday The Pitt News
announced the formation of_ En-
vironmental Action Zero Popu-
lation Growth. However. Student
Government and their advisors
have put a stop to our organiza-
tion.

They are afraid that we are
growing too fast. In April we wrote
a constitution and took steps to
receive campus recognition. We
were temporarily given space_in
Student Government.

As a result we planned pro-
grams for the spring term. We
also planned a teach-in for No-
vember spotlighting Dr. Paul
Ehrlich. But Student Government
is denying us continued use of
their offices and facilities. They
are not even sure that we. should
be given independent status. The
reasons:

1. We’re involved in_ the‘ outside
community.
2. We support ecologically sound

bills and pro-conservation can-
didates.

3. We are constantly growing and

expanding. I .
4. We are a “political” hot pot-
tatoe.

5. Grad students, med and dent
students and faculty members
want to join our group.

6. Our faculty advisor is from the
biology department and not
from the Dean of Students of-
fice.

We were told that we must wait
until September tor recognition.
.\'o teach-in.

6. Our affiliation with the Nation-
al Environmental Action office
in Washington, D. C., and Zero
Population Growth out of Los

V Altos, Calif.

until September for recognition.
.\’o teach-in with Dr. Ehrlich. who
wanted to make Pitt the first of
his six personal appearances. will
be held since SG will not permit
us to apply for an allocation. And
above all SG refuses to give us any
aid in our programs.

We find all of these objections
hard to believe. SC recognizes and
supports with financial aid such
organizations as Young Ameri-
cans f'or Freedom. Revolutionary
Socialist L'nion. Students for

Peace. Young Democrats. and _

Young Republicans. Are we as
"political" as these groups or
are we to contraversial for the
Lniversity‘?

In short we are being denied
the right to be a recognized cam-
pus organization. Our crime is
that we are too successful.

High schools. other organiza-
tions. faculty. and grad students
have gotten in touch with us and
promised time. effort. and coop-
eration. Why are we being sub-
jected to this political repression‘?

We can’t let ’our organization be
carefully pushed out of existence:
We are asking for help in letting
us organize and work as any other
campus organization.

Do we not have the same rights
as other campus organizations or
not‘?

‘Any financial help you can give
this struggling group will also be
tremendously appreciated.

 Return Of Mcllarthyism 0

Editor. The Pitt News:

I should like to reply to the
“Resident of Pittsburgh" whose
letter appeared in your May 15.
1970.issue.

I would be content to regard
this personsletter as being writ-
ten in the heat of anger.

However. I cannot do so be-
cause of one sentence this person
wrote. “Take a lesson from what
happened at Wall St..i\'ew York.
last week . .  this person says.

The parallels between the Wall

St. incident and similar incidents

”"in the recent motion picture "Z"
are more than striking. they are
frightening.

For a long time (about 15
years) most people in this country
were able to express their views
without fear of reprisal lneedless
to say this did not hold if you were
black. Jewish. Italian.etc. l.

However. aslin the film. he is
alive once again. I am referring
to the infamous Joseph McCarthy.

He made a brief appearance in
1954. but the voices of sanity
chased him back into-the wood-
work. Perhaps. radical students
have awakened him again. The

difference this time is that the
voices of sanity have disappeared.

This difference might be a fa-
tal one for freedom and the con-
stitution of this country.

Unless all people are able to
express their grievances without
fear of reprisal. we are headed for
big trouble.

Indeed. there are those who
think we have already found it.

I feel threatened by the "resi-

‘ dent of Pittsburgh" and those like

him. Let each choose his own path.
according to his conscience. in
these troubled times. but as for
me. give me liberty or give me
death!

Sounds corny. maybe. But. dear
Mr. Resident of Pittsburgh. lib-
erty is what this country is all
about. yours and mine.

Sincerely yours.

Even though Banks will be mak-
ing his first trip, the rest of the
squad have all been at the IC4As
before. “Certainly experience
helps,” said Banner. So in spite of
the injuries, the Bannerman
should not have butterflies.

Unlike the dual meets Em the
Pitt schedule. the competition at
the IC4A's will be much more in-,
tense. With so many schools parti-
cipating the meet will take two
days.. A . * 1 . A

regarded as the superior team in

Marty Liquori. who happens to be
the top active miler in the coun-
try. With this combination Villa-
nova will be tough to overcome.

IlllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE‘

by MIKE MILLER
The pressure of tough tennis
competition highlights two di-
verse views of Joel Hurwitz.

Hurwitz plays his best game
when the sqeeze is on. but the ten-
sion has an effect on his attitude.

JOEL HURWITZ

Call It “Killer Instinct’

"1 love to play tough competi-
tion." he says. "I play best un-
der pressure."

In six out of eight of his vic-
tories this spring, he has bounced
back from as far behind as triple-
match point.

Competition of this caliber.
however. causes a Jeckel and

Hyde tranformation in this per- .

sonality.

"I get really wound up." he
states. “I look at my opponent as
an enemy. an absolute mortal
enemy. I guess you could call it
a killer instinct."

Fortunately, Hurwitz confines
his killer instinct to the tennis
courts. ’

“Once I'm finished playing
that's the end of it." he reports.

His "mortal enemies“ are the
players he describes as "back
board" players, the ones who re-
turn every shot.

“It’s like hitting the ball against
a wall,’’ he says. “They are ex-
tremely consistant and they force
me to make mistakes. My biggest
weakness is lack of consistency.”

In addition to lack of consisten-
cy, Hurwitz has found playing con-
ditions extremely rough this year.

The scheduling of the matches
posed the biggest problem.

“We had eight matches togeth-
er. It was great for attitude. I
won six in a row. But the other
matches were scattered.”

He also found "every match
was like a road match." due to
lack of student support.

Despite these handicaps Hur-
witz has maintained the best rec-
ord on the team. 8-6. with the sea-
son ending tomorrow at Penn
State.

Hurwitz, a freshman. chose
Pitt soley for academic reasons
But, he felt—and still feels—that
Pitt has the potential for building
a good tennis team.

Golfers Down Allegheny
.On Meadville Course

The Rex Peery's golfers easily defeated Allegheny on a strange
course Tuesday. before meeting Penn State in their final match of the
season Thursday at Shannopin Country Club.

Mike McGuire paced the golfers Tuesday with a 73 in the 191/2-

512 victory over Allegheny.

Mike Jones shot the Pitt squads
second-best score. a 77. while
Peery's number one golfer. Rick
Plonka. fired for a 79.

Charles Patrick’s 84, Tim
Crist’s 85, and Mike Jones’ 87
