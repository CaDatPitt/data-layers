Cyclist in Fzﬂh e. bs lam struck by car

By Lane Hornfeck
Staff Writer

A University of Pittsburgh
student was struck in the Fifth
Avenue bus lane yesterday
afternoon by a car turning in to
the William Pitt Union entrance.

Dean Baetzhold was riding his
bike down Fifth Avenue in the
bus lane. When he approached
the entrance to the union, he
noticed a car preparing to turn
left in to the entranceway.

“I was riding my bike down
the bus lane, and I thought they
were going to stop, but they
didn't,” said Baetzhold.

The accident occurred at 3:45

p.m. Baetzhold was placed on a_

backboard and taken to
Presbyterian University Hospital
immediately after the accident.
He had no serious injuries and
was discharged at 4:20 p.m.

War often brings false prosperity

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Staﬁ“ Wﬁter

The University of Pittsburgh
Alumni Association luncheon
opened yesterday afternoon with
a verse of “Happy Birthday” sung
to the speaker, Pitt economics
Professor Reuben Slesinger.

‘‘I never had this many people

show up for one of my birthday

 

parties before,” said Slesinger
when he began his address at the
Westin William Penn Hotel.
Slesinger, who has been
afﬁliated with Pitt for over half a
century and is well known for his
accurate economic predictions,
said the 1991 economic outlook
is not very optimistic. “We are
forgetting about the hostilities at

the present time,” he said.

     
 

There is currently a tremendous
lack of consumer confidence,
according to Slesinger. He said
one reason is the United States’
current involvement in the war in
the Persian Gulf. Another is
business cutbacks such as layoffs
and unemployment.

“The growth factor has
simmered down, creating a lack

PS]P pledges to help
Iraqi war refugees

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

As the United States continues to bomb Iraq and its civilians,
the Pittsburgh Students For Peace will help Iraqi citizens,
according to PSfP member Jill Castek.

“If students don’t want to say they are against the war,” said
Castek, “they can at least help ease the damage now. We have
to help the people now, not at the end of the war when there
will be so much more to do.”

The PSfP started collecting funds for the war refugees through
a system in which people give a dollar and persuade someon
else to give a dollar. '

“With such a system, people will at least talk about the
situation,” said Castek, “and maybe this will also get people to
think more about the situation and what it means to everyone.”

Melissa Moran, also from PSfP, said that to raise more money
there will be an official kick—off dinner on March 17 at the
Birmingham Loft. Students will prepare a Middle Eastern dinner,
and there will be speakers as well. Peace activist Dan Berrigan
is tentatively scheduled to attend.

“We hope that through the fund raising for the war refugees,
wecan raise $1 million,” said Moran, “It was done during the
Vietnam War.”

Soldiers and Sailors serves as setting for key Lambs scenes

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall is an awesome sight to behold
at night, especially when it isn’t
being torn down and rebuilt to
accommodate a modern parking
garage.

Last February during the historic
buildings monumental face—lift,
the verdant, healthy lawn and
smooth cobblestone walkways
which grace Fifth Avenue were
nowhere to be seen, and the
view from the neighboring
William Pitt Union was ultimately
annoying. Instead of the grass
brilliant nighttime
illumination, the familiar

-landscape was filled with
, towering cranes and cement

mixers, and it seemed as if things
would never be the same.
But the industrial carnage

notwithstanding, the memorial

still bustles with activity intended
to capitalize on the locale’s historic
and beautiful ediﬁce — a classical
building in its grandest mode,
which under normal

circumstances would be
invaluable to filmmakers. But not
now. How could anyone use this
dump?

Behind the beaux arts design
of the monument, Jonathan
Demme smiles as he watches
crew members nail halves of pine
trees along Bigelow Boulevard.
The disguise is clever; from the
camera’s point of view, no one
will ever see the enormous pit
that workmen have been digging
since the beginning of August.

To the left of the Bigelow
entrance, a cannon has been
moved to make room for an
imitation iron sign that says,
“Shelby County Courthouse.”
Several feet away, five squad cars
with Memphispolice logos stand
by at the curb, awaiting a pivotal
scene. Police officers pace back
and forth, holding back the crowd.
Finally everything is ready.

Suddenly, various ﬂoodlights
come on the scene of barely
controlled pandemonium.
Flashing red lights, men shouting
commands, sirens in the distance.
SWAT members in full gear leap

MYTH:  

“You can tell if someone has an
STD (§exualIy '_I'_ransmitted
Qisease) just by looking at them.”

The truth is that aoysexually active person is at risk for
a sexually transmitted disease. A person can have an
STD, show no symoto‘ ms at all, and pass it to their sex

partners. If you’re concerned about STDs, the Allegheny

‘County Health Department's STD clinic provides free and
oonfioontial screening and treatment for STD. We also
offer free and confidential testing for HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS. We're located on Forbes Avenue, in the

heart of Oakland. For more information and clinic hours,

call the Health Department at 578-8080.

Cops kneel for cover behind cars,

voice yells, “CUT! Very good.
Thank you very much. Let’s do it

The crew hustles to reset Scene
81A on The Silence of the Lambs,
Demme’s 12th motion picture. It
has taken four months of
extensive location shooting in
greater Pittsburgh to get this two-
hour movie on film, and here at
Soldiers and Sailors things are
going right on schedule.

Inside the 80-year-old terra-
cotta structure, a banquet hall
has been converted into a
Tennessean historical-society
room to temporarily hold the evil
Hannibal Lecter (Anthony
Hopkins), the cannibalistic
psychiatrist who aids FBI trainee
Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) in
her search for a vicious serial
killer. It is the most important
scene in the film, the climactic
moment of this tragic tale. Inside
the room, the terror lurks behind
the iron bars.

Outside, however, things are a
bit less horrible — they’re just
exciting. Oakland residents and
Pitt rubbernecks peer past the
guards and assistant directors to
catch a glimpse of Foster and
Hopkins walking from their
trailers to the set. Several people
are rude enough to shout
suggestive obscenities at Foster,
who has grown accustomed to
ignoring such jibes. The hecklers
are soon quieted by others who
are trying to “watch the movie.”

Location manager Neri
T annenbaum chose the Oakland
site for its remarkable architecture.
“It’s difficult to ﬁnd this sort of
thing in other cities,” she says.
“Usually progress has made its
mark already. Well, you can
certainly see how it’s fared in
front of the building. But we only
need the interiors and one of the
sides to get these shots. Luckily,

they’re only doing construction

on Fifth Avenue. You have to
fool people.”

In the final cut, Pittsburghers
will most likely recognize. the
memorial and may laugh at the
small title in the lower right-hand
corner of the screen that identifies
the setting as Memphis, Tenn.

But the scene's intensity will
probably outweigh the self-
consciousness of the shot.

“It'll be worth it,” says Demme,
“It's great to use existing locations
because it’s likely they’ll be
around long after the film wraps.”

Inside the banquet hall, George

‘Romero stands ready in his cop

uniform. His small cameo-is one
of several in Lambs, and he seems
grateful for the chance to dress
up and pretend.

“It's quite a set,” he says
between sips of coffee. “I think
it’s going to be a great picture.
This place is absolutely
incredible."

Now that the film is ready for
release (this Thursday), Oakland
residents will certainly appreciate“
the traffic delays caused during
the two weeks of shooting at
Soldiers and Sailors.

“I think it’s great,” says student
Mike Grollman, who was an extra

in the film. “It’s a great opportunity ..

for the city to get more involved
in production. You really get
drawn into the action, but at the
same time there's a lot of waiting
around. It really demystifies the

movies — takes the magic away *

to see it on your own turf.”

of confidence,” he said. “In
essence, people are unsure about
the future.”

Slesinger said that it is not
difficult to project the effects of
the war on the economy. It is
more important to determine what
will happen after a war is over, he
said.

He claimed that there is false
prosperity during wartime. Some
industries prosper, and some do
not. Financial markets suffer the
most, he said.

According to Slesinger, this will
not be a quick war for the United
States. “Itwill take as long as one
year or more to win the war,” he
said.

Slesinger presented a
comparison between a normal
economy and one opposed to
one during wartime by parodyin g
popular television shows.

In “Recession, She Wrote,” he
said that there are recessionary
conditions in almost every facet
of the economy.

“If your neighbor is
unemployed, it is a recession; if
you are unemployed, it is
depression,” said Slesinger.

According to Slesinger, business
investments are essential for the
growth of the economy. He stated
that although business
investments account for only 15
percent of the Gross

National Product, investments
are crucial to the GNP because
they essentially improve the

economy.

“llnvestmentsl are way down,”
said Slesinger. “Very few business
firms are expanding and very few
are building new plants.”

In another television parody,
“Jeopardy,” Slesinger said that
there are many areas in the
community in danger.

“Much of this jeopardy is the
result of living a type of life
which earlier was too rich,” he
said.

Slesinger said he sees a problem
with the borrowing and lending
practices of banks ‘

“Banks have a lot of money to
lend out, but the people who
would like to borrow money from
the banks, the banks won’t lend
to. The people the banks would
like to lend to don’t want to
borrow any money,” he said.

’ He said that the increased
reserves accumulated by banks
are being used for safe securities
such as federal bonds, which
Slesinger said do not stimulate
the economy.

“The economy is based on an

assumption that you have a right
to profits, success and failure,” he
said.

He said that people are
concerned about the sanctity of
their basic saving investments;
they are worrying about problems
such as the future of the banks.

Because these people feel that
banks are in trouble, there is a lot
of indecision about investments,
he said.

“The whole ﬁnancial structure
is lacking confidence,” he said.

Slesinger explained his position
with an analogy between weather
forecasters and economic
projectors.

“Today, the weather forecasters
can feel very happy because
they’re either right or wrong 50

Slesinger.

“If the results don’t take place,
it is not the forecaster that is

Biker

the left turn when the car
collided with Baetzhold’s
bicycle. The driver of the car
and two passengers, all Pitt
students, said that they did not
see Baetzhold coming until it

was too late. '
According to the driver, who

refused to be identified, “The

sun was glaring, and I was

slowing down to turn in, and
then my friend screamed my
name.”

The back-seat passenger, a
sophomore, said, “I was
paying attention to a bus, and ‘
I never even saw the biker.
The sun was so bright. The
next thing I knew was that
something flew over the car
and past my window.”

Refugees
Continued from page 3
According to Castek, a
delegation will be sent to deliver
the money when the group has
sufficient funds to give the people
of Iraq. Upon arriving in Iraq the
delegation has to decide where
and to whom to give the money,
according to Castek.

The PSfP stands on a quote by
Thomas Merton which
summarizes why it wants to help
the refugees:

“I am on the side of the people A

who are being burned, cut to
pieces, tortured, held as hostages,
gassed, ruined, destroyed. They
are the victims of both sides. To
take sides with massive power is
to take sides against the innocent.
The side I take is then the side of
the people who are sick of war
and want peace in order to rebuild
their country.”

This says it all, according to
Castek andaMoran.

Just in case you were wondering
°Uh oh,,looks like the Soviet
Union is falling apart again.
Those madcap, independence-
’ crazed Lithuanians just don’t want
to listen to Uncle Gorby over in
Moscow. You’d think that he would
have taught them a lesson with his
mad dash to take over the televi-
sion station in Vilnius last month.
Nope. They decided to hold an
informal “poll” to see if the
Lithuanian people wanted inde-
pendence. Gorbachev said thatthis
vote was illegal, and that nobody
will take it seriously within the
Kremlin.
Funny—— about 90 percent of the

‘ 85 percent who voted were in

favor of it.

So what happens next? They
have already filed for sovereignty;
the population wants sovereignty,
yet the Soviets seem unwilling to
grant it. Nine other republics have
done likewise, though none have
had the actual courage to make a
referendum such as this one.

I'm sorry, but I've been predict-
ing a civil war over there for months
now. Tragic as it is, this is too good
an opportunity to stop predicting
that now. I’ll give it until June. If
nothing happens by then, then I’m
wrong, and the Soviet Union will
once again be the peace-loving,

communist capital it has always
been. Call me cynical, but I don’t
see that happening.

-Speaking of the Soviet Union,
here’s an example of just how
screwed up things are over there:

A group in the Ukraine said last
week that it was thinking about
opening-up Chernobyl as —- get
this — a tourist attraction. No,
really. A group of people is willing
to open up the area around the
worst nuclear accident in history
for a few bucks. They offer a tour
of the reactor site, showing off
where the meltdown took place, as
well as the protection surrounding
the core. According to one local
resident, “Life is good, but short.” I
guess so.

. I can just imagine the announcer

on “Wheel of Fortune” saying,
“Congratulatio ns./ For you adven-
turous types, you 've just won a trip
for two to Chernobyl, where you ’ll
spend seven days and six nights
losing not just your money but your
hair as well. Free chest X—rays
during the tour. You want a tan?
We’ll give you one inside and out.
Now you ’ll /enow what that micro-
wave popcorn goes through.”

Of course, the best part of the
whole deal is that if you don’t want
to pay for radiation treatment if
you should need it, don’t worry! It
comes at no extra charge. Gee,
what a bonus. _

-Jim Bakker got sort of a reprieve
yesterday.“

A three-judge panel from the
U.S. Court of Appeals decided that
Bakker, the religious leader ridi-
culed for the infamous Jessica Hahn
fiasco, received unfair treatment at
his sentencing and must be re-
sentenced. The panel ruled that
Judge Robert Potter deprived
Bakker of his due process for
sentencing because of comments
Potter made concerning religious
leaders. However, the charges
against still have not been dropped.

Well, seeing as I can’t think of
any lower life form than a televi-

‘sion evangelist, I guess I shouldn't
care. But hey, it does ’go to show

 W'ht' gong n, exe fo th War

that the system does work, in its
own warped sort of way.

-Well, the city of Pittsburgh can
add another person to its list of
famous personalities. Mario
Lemieux, Doug Drabek, Bobby
Bonilla, Douglas Hann 

Yes, Douglas Hann. This Fox
Chapel native was recently kicked
out of Brown University as the first
example of new anti-harassment
policies. Hann got the boot for
screaming racial epithets on cam-
pus. Since it was his second vio-
lation of these policies and he "was
drinking,’ he was expelled from
Brown. It’s so nice to see that we
can come up with such winners
from this area.

-Finally, just how does the uni-
versity get off by saying that we
can’t have access to public infor-
mation, anyway? Oh, excuse me, I
forgot. That Buckley Amendment
is so all-consuming of student
records. ,

Has it ever occurred to the ad-
ministration thatsome of the people
who are involved in these incidents
are not students? Probably not.
That would foul up its policy of
protecting the students and clear
up its libel complex.

]eﬂTatusleo is the perspective edi-
tor of The Pitt News

Administration responds to records controversy

Your news story, “Campus police
prohibit access to crime reports
(Thursday, Feb. 7)," and the ac-
companying editorial, “To swerve
and deﬂect ..." contained serious
factual inaccuracies. I would like to
correct any wrong impressions. First,
in the story you say the new policy
is a violation of the “Open Records
Act." In Pennsylvania, the law that
addresses this issue is known as the
“Right to Know Law.” The courts
have found that this law does not
apply to state—related universities in

Letters

Pennsylvania. Pitt is a state—related
university and thus exempt from its
requirements.~

Second, in your editorial you say
the new policy is in direct violation
of the Freedom of Information Act.
This is also incorrect. The Freedom
of Information Act is a federal law
which covers federal-agency
records only. Pitt is not a federal

agency.

Third, you also imply in the
editorial that the Buckley Amend-
ment does not apply to campus
police records. This is also incor-
rect. In certainrcircumstances, the
Buckley Amendment allows edu-
cational institutions to share its
campus police records ‘pertaining

to students with law—enforcement I

officials of the same jurisdiction.
The University of Pittsburgh police
records which relate to students
are not within any exception under

the Buckley Amendment. On the
contrary, such records are educa-
tion records under Buckley and‘
thus may not be released to any
third parties without express writ-
ten consent of the student named
in the reports. Thus Pitt’s new
policy on access to police crime
reports is not in ‘violation of exist-
ing state or federal law. On the
contrary, it strictly adheres to them.
As I said earlier, the new policy’
is designed to protect the confi-
dentiality of Pitt faculty, staff, stu-
dents and others. A University of
Pittsburgh police report provides a
written record of a criminal situa-
tion that can serve as a basis for
documenting the incident and for’
further investigation. Such reports
often include names of individuals
who may or may not be directly
associated with the incident This

_ report as complete as possible so
that appropriate follow—up can be

pursued. The university's new
policy is not intended to withhold

crime news from the media. In‘

place of a police report, the uni-
versity will provide The Pitt News
and any other news organization
with daily incident reports that
detail the date, time, place and
nature of any and all criminal in--
cidents that occur on campus. This
is what we are expected to do
under existing law, and'this is the
course we intend tofollow.

The Smoking Ban...

Helps get rid of cough...

Marisa
LaQuatra

The campus-wide smoking ban,
instituted on Feb. 1, is a good idea.
The new ban means no smoking is
permitted in any campus buildings,
including private offices, whereas
in the past smoking was allowed in

some public places or in private .

offices at the discretion of the oc-
cupants. I feel that the new ban will
prove effective for a number of
reasons. _

I remember going to see ateacher
in his office. Little did I know that
I would be talking to Puff the
Magic Dragon. I really had to re-
strain myself from leaving due to
the bothersome smoke because
my questions to him were impor-
tant and needed to be answered.
So there I sat with clouds of smoke
surrounding me. He would huff
and puff away on his cigarette until
my vision_ was clouded and I could
no longer see. My eyes began to
water. At that point, I could not tell
the teacher apart from the desk. I
relied totally on his voice and not
his facial expressions for commu-
nication.

After the assault on my eyes, the
smoke attacked my respiratory
system. I began to cough and got a
terrible headache. For those people
who are allergic to cigarette smoke,
the simple headache could have
developed into a migraine.

It did not all stop there. I began
to imagine my lungs being at-
tacked and turning charcoal black,
and such a thought made my heart

beat faster. With my lungs and-

heart already in jeopardy, I imme-
diately stopped all questions di-
rected to my teacher and, thinking

that it would be best to leave as '

soon as possible, Iran out of the
office. , l 3 ,
If you think I was stretching the
truth a bit with the office story, you
are right I am just trying to explain

, what smoke can do to some people.

It is amazing how destructive smoke
can be; Sure, we all know that it

warned by the surgeon general,
but how many people know that
non-smokers who are around
smokers are just as likely to de-
velop health problems related to
smoking? A recent article in The
Pittsburgh Press stated that, ac-
cording the American Heart Asso-
ciation, “passive cigarette smoke
kills 53,000 non-smoking Ameri-
cans each year, making it the third-
leading preventable cause of
death.” The 53,000 breaks down to
37,000 dying from heart disease,

3,700 dying from lung -cancer and‘

12,000 dying by other forms of
cancer tied to passive smoke. In
addition, “passive smoke increases
the tendency" of blood to clot,
thereby raising the chancesfor a
heart attack.”

I could go on, but I prefer to look

"at it from the other side as well.

"Although I back the smoking ban,
I can see the smokers’ point of
view. They are addicted to nicotine,
which is not an easily broken habit.
The question,‘“Just how much of a
habit is smoking?" can be answered

by associating with smokers and

following their activities closely. I
am talking about something other
than counting how many cigarettes
they smoke a day; I am talking
about what the smoker would do
to have one. For example, last year
I had a night class from 5:45 to 8: 10,
with a break at 7: 1 5. During breaks,

my friend would clutch her pack of
cigarettes and run outside, since
there was no smoking areas inside
the building. It were ofterrfreezing
cold outside. Nevertheless, my
friend went out with no jacket and
started to smoke that lone cigarette.

Concerned for her health, I would
try to‘persuade her to come back
inside, but to no avail. I recently
talked to her about the smoking
ban. ,

I realized that nothing I could
say or do wouldchange her mind
about smoking because I have tried
to help her quit in the past It was

‘ then that I was glad the university

was passing stricter ‘laws on

smoking. If I can’t help my friends,

maybe the university can. 3

\

...but we're all adults 3

Whether passive smoking has
caused any deaths remains a con-
troversy. There are statistics
pointing fingers in different direc-
tions about the medical effects of
my cigarettes on you, so rather
than argue medical presumptions
that the experts haven’t yet come
to a collective agreement on, why
don’t we put that aside and con-
centrate on the issue of smoking as
an irritant to the non-smoker and
the ramifications of the government
regulating smoking?

I have a tiny office on the fourth

ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union, and

John Yeager and Wesley Posvar
have decided that I can’t smoke
Marlboros in it anymore. Not even
if I open the window. Not even if
I close the door. Not even if I do all
those things and blow the smoke
outside through a tube while

humming praises -to C. Everett»

Koop. .

The thing that I can’t understand
is, why? The non-smoker has come
a long way, baby. Years ago,

smokers owned all the rights, and

that was no good, so they decided
that all restaurants and offices had
to have designated non-smoking
areas. Not a bad solution, except
enough non-smokers got together
and decided equal billing wasn't a
big enough share of the pie. So
then the laws were changed, and
designated smoking areas were the
call of the day —— if and only if all
employees have them. 3

So in the late"80s, the “lounge”
became a haven of smokers, puffing
away while their equally competent
non-smoking counterparts were
free to roam around the office
eating, drinking and performing
any number of other offensive
habits (i.e., excessive cologne,
nose-picking or telling racially of-
fensive jokes) as long as they didn't
do it with a glowing "nicotine stick
in their hands, ,

John Yeager, our esteemed vice
president of administration, an-

making process)‘ at the Senate"

looking to _ avenge last
Monday’s 86-80 loss to Pitt,
used the same weapons they
employed last week to beat
the Panthers last night 83-73.

Terry Dehere scored. 24
points, and Anthony Avent
added 21 and 11 rebounds in
leading the Hall to victory at
the Brendan Byrne Arena in
the Meadowlands. ,

The loss dropped Pitt to 17-
8 overall, 6-5 in the Big East,

’ while the Pirates improved to
15-7 overall and evened their
conference record at 6-6.

Sean Miller led Pitt with 22
points and four assists, making
all six of his three-point shots.
Jason Matthews and Darelle
Porter added outside offense,
scoring 16 and eight points,
respectively.

Dehere started the game hot,
hitting his first four shots,
including three three-pointers.
Miller and Porter kept Pitt
close, however, as almost all
of the Panthers’ offensecame
from the perimeter. Matthews,
coming off the bench for the
third straight game, added
more spark to the outside game
with eight points in the first
half, although he did not score
until around the 10-minute
mark.

Bobby Martin and Brian
Shorter did account for some
inside baskets, but both picked
up three f1rst—half fouls, giving

good portion of the period
where they watched the
Panthers’ perimeter show.
For the Pirates, Avent picked
up the scoring slack after

The Seton Hall Pirates,

them a seat on the bench for as

Dehere was shut down by
Matthews. After scoring 1 1 in the
first seven minutes, Dehere was
held to just two in the remainder
of the half.

The Panthers were not so
fortunate in stopping Avent,
however. The 6 foot-9 senior
scored 11 points and grabbed
four rebounds in the first period,
continually keeping the ball alive
on the offensive boards. ,

Seton Hall also received good
performances from freshmen
Arturas Karnishovas and Assaf
Barnea, who played good
defense and passed well.

Miller hit all four of his three-
point attempts before
intermission, including one from
beyond the NBA line of 23 feet,
nine inches, which gave Pitt its
last lead before the half.

Settling for the last shot,
Matthews turned the ball over,
leading to a Bryan Caver slam
which put the Hall on top at
intermission, 57-36.

The teams traded baskets in
the second half, but Seton Hall
was more active on offense and
defense. After burning Pitt from
the outside, Dehere went inside,
driving the lane on several
occasions. Caver, the 6-3
freshman, provided the spark for
the 9-0 Seton Hall run with Miller
on the bench.

Caver scored 10 points and
had two assists, and the Pirates
got good interior play from Avent,
Jerry Walker and Karnishovas,
who put a stranglehold on Pitt’s
inside game. '

The Panther frontcourt of

Pirates shut down Psie, wt’ - 73

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Terry Dehere (24) puts a shot up against Pitt two weeks ago. Dehere
scored 24 points in Seton Hall's 83-73 victory over Pitt last night.

Staﬂ’ Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnastics team has
experienced several extraordinary comebacks this
season. Last weekendthe Lady Panthers traveled to
Temple University to meet up with the Lady Owls,
and with the help of Pitt’s returning gymnasts, they
came away with a 179.20—178.8O win.

Early this season, Pitt fans witnessed the
comebacks I of senior Carrie Carnesale and
sophomore Suzie Coast, both of whom had knee
injuries. Following her teammates is senior Jeanne
Vecchio, who is also coming back from several
injuries that have hampered her collegiate
gymnastics career.

Vecchio reentered the all-around event two
weekends ago and said she feels as if she has ﬁnally
returned to gymnastics. “I feel like a real gymnast
now,” said Vecchio. “I’m now competing all-around
instead of specializing in one event.”

Vecchio now laughs about her past injuries, but
there was a time when injuries kept her from doing
one of the things she loves.

For Vecchio it has been a long, tough road back
from injuries to her knee and foot. During her
junior year at Fox Chapel High School, Vecchio
underwent two separate surgeries on her right
knee and another during her senior year.

Vecchidscollegiate career has also proven to be

painful. During her freshman year at Pitt, she
performed on the balance beam as well as the
uneven parallel bars, but a stress fracture in her
right foot took her out of Pitt’s lineup.

Vecchio still competed on bars while her foot
was injured during her sophomore year. “I felt that
I had to help, out the team,” she said.

At the beginning of her junior year at Pitt, she was
practicing a vault when she missed the landing pit
and sprained both of her ankles. When she began
to practice again after her ankles had healed, she
still felt pain in her right foot when she walked.

Vecchio had another stress fracture, this time to
the navicular (the arch of the foot), and tendinitis
in her right foot. This time her injury took her out
of the Lady Panthers’ lineup for the entire season.
Vecchio still supported Pittfs team by videotaping
the meets for the coaches. ‘

“I’m definitely ready for [the all-around event],
and I’m glad to ﬁnally be back,” said Vecchio. Last
weekend, Vecchio posted her career-high all-around
score of 56.60. She has not performed in the all-
around event for S 1/2 years, and she now wants
to see if she can continue to break records.

This Saturday the Lady Panthers will be hosting
the Lady Cardinals of Ball State University. The
meet is set for 1 p.m. at Trees Hall.

PI’I'I‘ BITS: At Temple the Lady Panthers came
from two points behind the Lady Owls to win by
four-tenths of a point.

Hoop team
featured
on cards

By Scott Campbell

Asst. Sports Editor

Imagine trading Darren
Morningstar for Michael Jordan.
As strange as that scenario
sounds, it is a possibility now
with the release of a set of 12
trading cards depicting Panther
basketball players.

“I never really thought about
anyone actually trading my card
or anything,” said Morningstar.
“It’s a good promotion, though.
They’re really neat.”

The cards, distributed through
Foodland Markets and the
Pittsburgh Police Department,
were released last month and
feature a color picture on the
front and a short biography of
the player on the back, along
with an a_nti—drug message.

“It’s a good feeling to be on
them,” said forward Antoine
Jones. “It’s an honor to be on a
card like that. It’s something that
the younger kids can have to
look up to.”,

Along with Morningstar and
Jones, the set also features cards
of Brian Shorter, Bobby Martin,
Jason Matthews, Darelle Porter,
Sean Miller, Chris McNeal, Gandhi
Jordan, Omo Moses, Ahmad
Shareef and Jermaine Morgan.

A set of 12 cards was also 

issued last year.

“It makes you feel special,”
said Jordan. “It means that you’re
recognized as a good player. But
I try not to get a big head about

it or anything. I don’t feel that I’m 1

an NBA-like player now or a big-
time player or anything like that.”
“I never thought I would be on
a baseball card or basketball card
or anything like that,” said
See Cards, page -9

Seton Hall’s defense allowed it
to build up a 14-point lead, 75-
61, with just under five minutes
remaining in the contest. Evans
put on the Panthers’ fullcourt
press, and Miller responded with

his sixth trey of the evening,.

Matthews was then fouled on a
three—point attempt. He hit three
free throws to cut the margin to
75-67 with 3:50 left.

From there, Seton Hall held Pitt
to just three f1el'd—goal attempts
and hit six of eight foul shots to

preserve the win.

Cards

Continuedfrom page 8
Shareef. “It's good to see that the
kids like them. They can collect
them, and people can come up to
you and ask for your autograph.”

Not all the Panthers were
enthralled by the collectibles,
however.

“I don’t think they’re special or
anything,” said McNeal. “It’s just
a card. But I don’t mind giving
my autograph on them or
anything.

“That's just part of being a part
of the University of Pittsburgh
basketball team.”

Most players say they have
been approached by kids before
and after gamesto sign the cards,
and none of the players seems to
mind. 7

“It’s a good thing to sign them. V

The kids get a chance to meet us
after the game,” said Jordan.

“I used to go to a lot of Cleveland
Cavaliers games and try to get
autographs, and one time
someone [John “Hot Rod”
Williams] turned me down, and I

said to myself, if I ever got in that
situation, that 1 would always
sign.”

Some Pitt players used to collect
trading cards themselves.

“I think pretty much every kid
collected’ baseball cards when
they were young,” said
Morningstar.

“And a lot of kids lately have
been coming up to a lot of players,

not just me. Getting cards_

autographed is the big fad right
now.”

, “I tried to collect cards as a kid,
but I couldn’t keep up with it,”
saidjones. “I tried to stick with it,
but I just couldn’t.”

“I used to collect football cards
when I was little,” said Jordan. “I
used to have all the Cleveland
Browns and all the Pittsburgh
Steelers. I used to have about
3,000 cards, I think.” , “

Most of the Pitt newcomers
also said theywould save some
of their “rookie” cards from this
year’s set.
