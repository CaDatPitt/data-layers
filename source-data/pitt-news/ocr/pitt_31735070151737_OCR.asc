A drop in tuition at nearby private universities
has led to increasing enrollment patterns,
whereas state-owned universities are hik-
ing tuition prices while experiencingismaller

' enrollments.

In 2011, the average tuition discount,
which is institutional grant dollars as a share ~
of gross tuition and fee revenue, for fresh-
men at private universities was 42 .8 percent,‘
according to the most recent study by the
National Association of College and University
Business Ofﬁcers. The study also reported
that the average markdown in tuition prices
at private universities for all undergraduate
students was 37.2. percent.

approximately 15 students.

“Look at the career resources of other

schools in other areas,” Kavalukas said.

By doing so, students can ﬁnd companies
that are typically receptive to college employ-

ees, ratherthan blindly searchingthrough the p

As Larry and Carol’s continues to op-
erate alter a drug bust on Tuesday,
authorities continue to make efforts
to shut down the restaurant, much
to the praise of local corporations.
“Again, the ultimate goal is to get
the business to close its doors,” said
Mike Manko, spokesman for District
Attorney Stephen Zappala. '
On Aug. 27, Fadi Aboud, 35, the
owner of Larry and Carol’s Pizza Res-
taurant, located at 410 Semple St.,
was arrested and charged for alleged
major drug possession at his estab-
lishment. After a six-month-long in-
vestigation, authoriﬁes searched both
the restaurant and Aboud’s homein
the lower Hill District, conﬁscating
an assortment of narcotics including
cocaine, Percocet, OxyContin and
marijuana, as well as paraphernalia.
Zappala is attempting to declare
the pizza shop a “nuisance property,”
allowinghimto order its closure with-
in 10 days of the declaration. .
This ability is a result ofZappala’s
collaboration with Mayor Luke Ra-

          
   

 

venstahl to create a Nuisance Prop-
erty Task Force in March 2010. The
force is comprised of representatives
of the city Law Department, the Dis-
trict Attomey’s Office, the Pittsburgh
Bureau of Police and the Bureau of
‘Building Inspection.

According to a statement from I

March 2011, the partnership between
the city and the district attorney led
to the eviction of 33 nuisance proper-
ties in Pittsburgh.

Wanda Wilson, executive director
for Oakland Planning and Develop-
ment Corporation, appreciates the
efforts to close the business;

“I thinkthat’s apositive step inthe
right direction for making a better
community.’We workin cooperation
with a lot of residents through code
enforcement totarget disruption in
the neighborhood,” she said. “It’s
good to see there’s enforcement going
on with the community and creating
a better neighborhood.”

However, Jim Flarmery, a profes-
sor in Pitt’s law school, noted that
whilethe closure of such a business
may be seen as positive, it can have
unforeseen effects due to the respon-

siveness of the city and impact upon

the neighborhood.

“In actual practice, however, even
the immediate ‘local’. impact of clos-
ing a nuisance property may some-
times be more complex — a mixture
of positive and -negative results. In
addition to removing an eyesore or a
health hazard, for example, the clos-
ing may lead directly or indirectly to a
loss of tax revenue, an empty business

front that will give the appearance‘

of blight, reduced local employment
opportunities, etc.,” Flarmery said in
an email. -

An employee at Larry and Carol’s
refused to comment on the charges or
status of the business on Wednesday,
Aug. 28. Additionally, an unidenﬁﬁed
party at Larry and Carol’s hung up
the phone when the restaurant was

contacted last night.

Aboud could also not be reached
for comment.

According to Manko, Zappala»

regularly communicates with police

chiefs from local universities about.

public safety, and will reach out to
them again to discuss ideas or initia-
tives that could cultivate a safer area
in light of the recent arrest at Larry
and Carol’s. I

Sophomore Caity Loper had at-

OPINIONS

V-EDITORIAL

Government, colleges must
prioritize careful cost—reduction

Simon Brown
Columnist

When Barack Obama enrolled for
his ﬁrst year at Occidental College
in 1979, the average cost of a uni-
versity education stood at roughly

$8,700 per year. When he sends his’

daughter, Malia Obama, off to col-
lege in 2016, the cost will be about
$18,300 per year — and that’s af-
ter being adjusted for inﬂation.
Perhaps the president had

this sentiment in mind when, two '

weeks ago, he publicly unveiled his
plan to use federal ﬁnancial sup-
port to encourage, universities to
reduce the price of the education
that they provide.

It would seem that he’s also well
aware that most American fami-
lies‘ will have a much harder time

paying that $18,300 than he and

Michelle Obama will.

The plan that the president
ﬁttingly announced at university
campuses across New York and

A Pennsylvania calls. for a system

to rank universities -.— public,
private and for-proﬁt — along
several metrics, including reduc-
tion of cost, accessibility to low-
income students and graduation
rates. These rankings would then
correlate to the amount of federal
support each university receives
by way of student-loan programs.

Simply put, if you go to a school
with a better ranking, the federal
government will allot you a more
generous loan package.

This plan promises to be a
much-needed step in the right di-
rection for higher—education pol-
icy. With the tug-of-war between
public universities and their less-
than-supportive state governments
coupled with runaway costs of pri-
vate and for-proﬁt colleges, the

federal government can provide
a fresh voice in the conversation.
And states and universities might
actually pay attention when that
voice is backed by billions of tax-
payers’ dollars.

You would be hard-pressed to
ﬁnd any university administrator
or policymaker who doesn’t decry
the rising cost of college education.
Even more diﬁicult, however, is
ﬁnding any agreement on why the

costs are rising in the ﬁrst place.
The current debate is no morethan
an intricate web of ﬁnger-pointing.

Public universities blame aus-
tere state governments, and state

governments blame irresponsible 7

public universities. ‘ a V

a In the midst of this chicken-
and-the-egg debate, the cost of
ﬁnancing for-proﬁt colleges has
skyrocketed with disappointing re-
turns. The 13 percent of all enrolled
college students who attend these
institutions receive 25 percentiof
all federal student aid, even though
only about 50 percent end up with
a degree to show for it. It comes as
no surprise, then, that these stu;
dents also default on their loans
at a rate much higher than those

at non-proﬁt colleges.

Universities of all varieties

enjoy the autonomy to set their
tuition at whatever they deem nec-
essary, and the funding mechanism
for federal student loans will con-
tinue to foot the ever—mounting
bill. So when universities incur the
considerable cost to build extrava-
gant new dining halls, residence
halls and rock walls, they can often
pass it off to taxpayers. The federal
government, then, is perfectly po-
sitioned to discourage the needless
expense and unﬁnished degrees
that too often characterize the
contemporary university.

But just as with any hopeful
policy goal, the devil is in the ad-

jministrative details.

Though no legislation now ex-
ists_to stipulate the speciﬁcs of the
ranking criteria, the generality of
standards the president listed leave‘
them open to gaping loopholes.

The primary goal of the legisla-
tion is to ﬁnancially reward insti-
tutions that can creativelyreduce
costs — an admirable goal, no
doubt. However, the problem lies
not just in the excessive costs of
many universities, but also in their
misplaced spending in programs

' that provide no value to a student’s
geducation. According to one study,
 —_a group offor-proﬁt colleges spent_

a collective $4.2 billion on market--
ing and recruiting, as opposed to
only $3.2 billion on instruction.
It is not overly pessimistic,
then, to consider the possibil-
ity that universities would reduce
costs primarily by slashing those
programs that actually produce

‘educational results, whether they

be small classes or tenured faculty.
It is particularly concerning that

BROWN

President Obama encourages these cuts to legitimate
classroom expenditures by suggesting that universities
pay for online classes for their students, rather than
providing ﬂesh—and—blood instructors. '
What is more, universities could appear more attrac-
tive to these hypothetical rankings by increasing gradu-

ation rates —-— but only by diminishing expectations for

student performance.
These problems parallel those that have arisen in the

wake of other evaluation schemes the federal govern-
ment has applied to educational institutions — most
notably to public schools —— through the No Child Left
Behind Act and the president’s Race to the Top program.
When policymakers tie funding to broad benchmarks
without providing the tools and methods to responsibly
achieve them, thosebenchmarks become irrelevant. You
need look no further than the standardized tests which
measure nothing more than how much time the teacher
spent working exclusively on test prep, to the exclusion
of all else. ,

To prevent these same ﬂaws from infecting his oth-
erwise promising higher—education’policy, Obama must

include professional university educators to oversee and
evaluate universities’ cost-reduction plans. By including
seasoned educators in the ranking process, the federal
government could disseminate and encourage best prac-
tices among universities through ﬁnancial incentives.
Only then could the admirable educational goals of the
legislation become a reality.

The nation, and the president, must work urgently
on this policy before it is lost in a partisan sea—change.
When Obama writes out his daughter’s ﬁrst tuition check
in three years, he’ll be nearly unemployed. I

CONCERT REVIEW

STRFKR puts on delightfully oddball performance at  Bar E

John Lavanga
A€'~J°E Editor

If STRFKR’s performance at Altar Bar
on Tuesday night had ended halfway
through, it would have been a moderate
success.

As the set began, a large, pixelated
display behind the band ﬂashed artful
visuals of multicolored pyramids and
whorls that accompanied STRFCKR’s
appealing blend of synthesizers and live
instruments perfectly while band mem-
bers remained somewhat static, largely

 

trapped behind keyboards and a drum set.
All of it was good. None of it was superb.

But from the momentlead vocalist
Joshua Hodges —— looking thrift—shop chic
in a long—sleeved ﬂoral dress — swapped
instruments with drummer Keil Corcoran
halfway through the show, it became clear
that the band wasn’t going to settle for.a
good show: They were looking to put on
a spectacle. ~ '

What a spectacle it was.

After the switch-up came a sudden,
virtually palpable surge of energy from

the group, who seemed reinvigorated by
the chance to put all of their talent and
versatility on full display. The members
went from static to borderline frantic,
and they upped the tempo of their tracks
to a practically dizzying pace. The audi-
ence, clearly shocked by the shift both in
instruments and in energy, responded in

kind. Suddenly the crowd, which ﬁlled.

both floors of the Altar Bar to capacity,
transformed from arhythmically sway—
-ing indie crowd into participants in an
exuberant dance party.

On albums, STRFKR’s music always
feels as if it shouldbe danced to, but in

‘ person, their music ﬂat—out demands that

listeners groove. Rather than sounding
like louder but inferior renditions‘ of
their songs, the ‘simple, layered bleeps

g and sy_n_t__hrhythms of the band took on

new life in the venue — no small feat at

Altar Bar, where even must—see live acts

have battled to maintain the quality of
their sound. '

ingful music for its own sake.

It’s safe to go ahead and put Brendan
Canty, former drummer of Fugazi, in the
latter category.

punk history — Canty maintains that the
band never lost its connection to its music
and audience. “It never felt like an out-of-
body experience. It never felt like we had
arrived anywhere differently than where we
began,” he said, speaking about the popular-
ity that Fugazi garnered over the years.

“[We] never lost that sense of family along
the way.”

Canty is both humble and sentimental
about his time as a part of one of the most
inﬂuential bands of ’90s, often chuckling at
the absurdity of his journey.

“Instead of going to college and getting
into careers, we just ended up being in this
‘submarine’ for 18 years, and going all over
the world and making records,” he said with
a laugh. “[Fugazi] went through four or ﬁve
cycles of fans and audiences.”

Though heis certainly best known for
his years drumming in Fugazi, Canty ﬁrst
showed off his musical chops as a part of
the Washington, D.C.-based Rites of Spring.
The band originated just as the hardcore

scene of the early ’80s was beginning to dis-
appear, and many bands were wondering
what their next moves were. “I think a lot
of people after hardcore tried to ﬁnd ways
to go. Some people went metal. In Rites of
Spring, we just went towards writing songs,”
Canty said in jest.

This desire to write songs that surpassed
the paradigms of hardcore continued with
Fugazi. When Canty started playing with

A From STRFKR’s strange taste in backup
dancers to their incredible versatility as
musicians —- each member switched back
and forth between at least two instru-

The feelings of its creators are instantly
accessible, free of the necessary analy-
sis to understand what they mean. You
don’t need to know the political under-
pinnings of Afrobeat creator Fela Kuti’s
music to feel the joy of their community
or the anger of their oppression. The

opening notes of Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s i

Get It On” are instantly recognized as
a prelude for making the two-backed
beast, much like the tremor in Edith
Piaf ’s.voice‘conveys a sadness that can’t

. be described. Despite the barrier of

language and familiarity, the message
remains clear and the feelings intact.

World music is nothing more than an
archaic identifier, built on the shaky legs
of perceived cultural superiority. And we
must see it for what it is: a sloppy, lazy
term dependent on location to separate
musicians while denying artists some
well-deserved respect.

And only once we acknowledge that
“world music” isn’t really so foreign

ing — can we enjoy everything it has
to offer. At the end of the day, it’s just
music, and you can love it or hate it.
Some records you’ll mock, others you’ll
treasure. We’ll know that it was just a
s-illyjterm, a nonsense word that wasn’t
made to hold all the life and beauty that
it contained. I

Pitt women’s soccer played to a _1—1

draw against Robert Morris Univer-

sity Wednesday at the North Athletic
Complex in Moon Township, as the two
teams each scored in the ﬁrst half with
neither earning a golden goal through
two overtime periods. ~

The draw is Pitt’s (3-1-1) first draw
of the season and, consequently, ends
the Panthers’ two—game winning streak.
Robert Morris (3-0-1) took its ﬁrst deci-
sion beside a loss with the match’s result.

Junior forward Alex Charlebois I

scored for the Panthers in the 10th min-
ute on a header off a corner kick from
sophomore midfielder1Roosa Arvas,
which brought Pitt to an early 1-0 lead.
The score by Charlebois was her second
of the season and the culmination of
Pitt’s dominance of the early offensive
direction. '

Pitt took six shots in the match’s ﬁrst .

Pitt club baseball team continues its uphill climb in 2013

Ryan Bertonaschi
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s club baseball team, a student—run
organization formed eight years ago, has
garnered more student interest this fall
than any previous year. In fact, seven
years ago, just 50' names were listed on
the club’s sign-up sheet. The club has
been on an uphill climb ever since, as
124 students etched their names onto
the 2013-list. .

“That’s a good sign. [It means] 

didn’t turn people away or we didn’t dis-
gust people with the way we ran tryouts
[in the past] ,” player-president Mark
Cunliffe said. “It tells us we did good
structure-wise, and basically it says we’re

‘ selling ourselves correctly.” '

For the record, Pitt Club'Baseball is

a club that" gained recognition by the

University in 2007. The team practices
and plays its games in both thefall and
spring on Trees Field on upper campus.

The team has a president, a vice presi;

dent and a business manager, and it relies

on the Student Government Board for
a hefty -portion of its funding for road
games and equipment to complement
its own fundraising efforts.

In order for the club to remain com_-
petitive, the team must reel in a cycling
ﬂow of cash.--For example, player—vice
president Evan Fitzpatrick said the team
will host a fundraiser at Five Guys Burg-
ers and Fries in the near future.

On Tuesday night, more than 60 sign-‘
ees swarmed the intramural fields for

if «“showcase” by Cunliffe.

»“It’s like an NFL combine workout,”

e Cunliffe said of the conditioning-only

practice. “Tonight is strictly baseball

i then a cut.” ‘ E

BASEBALL

Once the roster is narrowed down, Cun-
liffe, alongside Fitzpatrick, will conduct
a second round of cuts to form the ﬁnal
team.

“It’s going to be a step-by-step pro-

cess, but we’re really looking forward to it ’

and it all starts tonight,” said Fitzpatrick.

The team will face a handful of new
opponents this year, as the National Club
Baseball Association’s North Atlantic Re-
gion faced serious realignment in the
offseason. A member of the western
division, Pittsburgh will have to travel
further distances than last year, due to
the additions of Cornell, Syracuse and
SUNY—Cortland.

“It is a little further to travel, but is
new competition, so that’s exciting and
we’re ready,” said Fitzpatrick.

Perennial power Penn State will re-
main in the way of Pitt and a Club Baseball
World Series. Pitt is the only team from

' the North Atlantic Region’s western divi-

sion to ever beat Penn State.

Speaking of realignment, Pitt’s all-
sport move into the ACC has not seemed
to discourage students from trying out
for Pitt Club Baseball, rather than at-
tempting to walk—on the University’s
Division I team.

Sophomore Adam Romanowski, an
inﬁelder and pitcher from Wyoming,
Pa., plans to try out after having played
American Legion Ball over the summer.
Romanowski said his decision came down
to academics.

“Between school and club baseball, it’s
a lot more relaxed. D—I,‘you’re there for
a reason. You’re playing baseball to win
and to make a name,” said Romanowski.

Forxchemical engineering major Mi-
chael Dugan, the club side of athletics
allows him to partake in the competitive
and recreational aspects of baseball while
still affording him and others the chance
to stay focused on academics.

“Academics are still a priority on top
of baseball,” said Dugan, who played
four years during high school in Ohio.
“Club baseball is really nice because it’s
more of a laid—back version yet it’s still
competitive.” I!

BARNES BURNER

2013 shouldn’t be remembered
as the year the streak ended

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor .

The Pittsburgh Pirates ﬁnally did it. The
Battlin’ Buccos won game No. 81 Tuesday
night, and the most infamous losing streak
in professional sports history ended‘ before
it could reach 21 years.

21, for those who don’t know, is the
number of possibly the greatest Pirate to
ever don a uniform — both as a player and
a person. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle
said he’d spoken to the Clemente family
throughout the season about the number
and the family’s desire for the streak not
to reach it.

It didn’t.

And here’s the best part about the
streak ending — it won’t be the best part
of the 2013 season.

For many years of the 20 in which
Pirates fans endured losing season after

losing season, there were a number of op-
portunities for the Pirates to prevent these
20 years from ever happening. The 2012
team had one such chance, as did 70-win
teams in 2002 through 2004.

Through July 2004, the team man-
aged by Lloyd McClendon was 39-43 but
stumbled to a 23-46 ﬁnish. And there was,
of course, the 16-36 record to conclude
last season.

Teams in 1997 and 1999 had chances
togprevent discussions like the one today
from ever happening after they won 79
and 78 games, respectively.

But it’s over. It’s ﬁnally over. More im-
portantly, though, the Pirates’ season isn’t
over and won’t be until the calendar ﬂips
to October.

When the 2013 season is examined,
though, the Pirates’ season will not be

BARNES

remembered as the onethat culminated
with a 4-3 victory in Milwaukee in which
Vin Mazzaro was the winning pitcher and
Travis Snider hit the game-winning pinch-
hit home run.

The achievement of winning 81 games
isn’t much of an achievement if it’s looked
at in a vacuum. That’s a .500 record. Aver-
age. For context, during the 20 years the
streak lasted, the New York Yankees went
to the playoffs 17 times and didn’t have a
single sub-.500 season.

The‘ new re-

Martin leaves when his two-year deal ex-
pires, 2009 ﬁrst-rounder Tony Sanchez

will take over. Behind him, Wyatt Mathisen, '

Jin-DeJhang and 2013 No. 14—overall pick
Reese McGuire wait.

And now that the Pirates have this tal-
ent, it’s turning into major-league-ready
talent, whether it’s the emergence of 2011

No. 1—overall pick GerritgCole making his

debut in 2013 or trading away prospects
to bring in impact bats like Marlon Byrd
andJustin Morneau.

Obviously, not every major prospect
turns out to be the next superstar. Not
every guy with hype turns out to be Mike
Trout or Stephen Strasburg.

But the more

gime in the of-
ﬁces at PNC Park
have made it clear
over the past
three seasons,
and even since
general manager
Neal Hunting—‘
ton took over in
2007, that the
Pirates had no
intentions of be-

“We’re pleased.
We’re not
satisfied.”

. Clint Hurdle

minor-league talent
a team has, chances
are better that a few
more will turn out to
what’s expected. It’s
self—evident with this
Pirates lineup fea-
turing home-grown
talent in the form of
Cole, Pedro Alvarez,-
Andrew McCutchen,
Starling Marte and

ing just average. _

‘ l-Iuntington’s trades of players such as
Nate McLouth, Xavier Nady andjason Bay
began the process of what he called “ﬂood—
ing the organization with minor-league
talent.” Check that one off as mission com-

, plete, despite public outcry.

Bay bought Bryan Morris. Nady brought
back Jose Tabata and Jeff Karstens.
McLouth netted Pirates All—Star lefty Jeff
Locke and Charlie Morton, who’s having
the best season of his career.

Beyond the majors, look around the
entire organization. The Pirates have tal-
ent everywhere. I ‘

There are Jameson Taillon, Luis He-
redia, Tyler Glasnow, Nick Kingham and
others who should throw off PNC Park’s
mound in the near future, as well as Alex
Dickerson and Alen Hanson, players who
should become mainstays at ﬁrst base and
shortstop, respectively.

In the outﬁeld, Gregory Polanco has
become one of baseball’s top prospects and

. is accompanied byjosh Bell, Barrett Barnes

and 2013 ﬁrst-rounder Austin Meadows,

who has destroyed the low-A levels in

‘which he’s played since he was drafted.
Even behind the plate, after Russell

Neil Walker.

Unfortunately, the fans have spent the
past few seasonsfocusing on ending the
streak instead of aiming for the goals the
Pirates organization has for itself. Remem-
ber, these are the same fans Hurdle has
said from day one that he would like to
reconnect with their city’s baseball team.
Based on the 17 sellouts at PNC Park this
year, it’s clear that Hurdle is close to reach-
ing his goal. -

To fans, though, I recommend you
bear in mind the words Hurdle has said
so many times when asked about small
accomplishments along the journey of
the 2013 season: “We’re pleased. We’re
not satisﬁed.”- These words are an echo
of the vision instilled in the Pirates’ front
ofﬁce by not only Huntington, but even
Bob Nutting and Frank Coonelly, as well,
that has made its way into the Pirates’ on-
ﬁeld product: .

So, what will satisfy the Pirates? When
he addressed the media following the ac-
quisition of Morneau, Huntington was
asked if this team is one he expects to
compete in the World Series.

“We do,” Huntington said. “People will
probably mock that statement, but we do.”
