College AIDS numbers higher than expected

By Lisa Goetz
Staff Writer

Preliminary results of a study of
20 U.S. colleges indicate that
about three in 1,000 students are
infected with the AIDS virus.

Final results from the study, be-
ing sponsored by the American
College Health Association and
the federal Centers for Disease
Control, are expected by spring
after 20,000 blood samples are
tested. Only about 5,000 samples
have been screened so far.

”Three in 1,000 is a little
higher than what I'd expect,” said
Dr. Monto Ho, chief of the Divi-
sion of Infectious Diseases at
Pitt's School of Medicine.

Blood samples used in the
study were taken from students
who visited on-campus student
health clinics with other ailments
which required that blood be
drawn.

The identities of students who
allowed their blood to be used in

the study were removed from the
blood samples before they were
tested for the AIDS virus. The stu-
dents are not informed of the
results of the tests.

The 20 colleges chosen for the
study were selected from six ge-

ographic regions of the United '

States. The schools used in the
study varied in size, each
representing the area in which
they are located.

H0 is unaware as to whether
Pitt is in the study.

”I wouldn't necessarily have to
had been informed [if Pitt were in
the study], but I probably would
have known if it were,” Ho said.

The preliminary results of the
study are not necessarily
representative of the number of
students at Pitt infected with the
AIDS virus.

According to Ho, the number
of students carrying the AIDS vi-
rus would ”vary tremendously"
among schools.

I Colleges located in cities with
high instances of AIDS, such as
San Francisco or New York City,
may have more cases of students
carrying the AIDS virus than do

' schools in Pittsburgh, according

to Ho.

”Pittsburgh is a low area [with
respect to the number of AIDS
cases],” Ho said.

Ha noted that the infected
population of a college can differ
from the infected population of
the area in which it is located.

”The population of a small col-
lege in New York may not reflect
the population of New York
City,” Ho said.

‘The infection rate of college
students, according to the study’s
initial findings, is twice as high as
the infection rate of military
recruits. ‘

”I wouldn't have expected the
college group to be more than the
military,” Ho said.

The distribution of cases of

AIDS infections between the sex-
es will figure significantly in
evaluating the final results of the
college study.

If the AIDS virus is found in a
large number of women's blood
samples, it could indicate that the
disease is spreading from the high

v risk groups into the general popu-

lation.

According to Ho, the infection
rate in females is lower than that
in males, and homosexual men
still represent the largest group
carrying the AIDS virus.

No studies to determine how
many students at Pitt are infect-
ed with the AIDS virus are
planned, according to Ho.

However, the CDC is preparing
to. conduct a household AIDS
study in Pittsburgh.

”It’s not easy to test an institu-
tion. There is a great amount of
effort involved in making the tests
confidential. It's a touchy area,"
Ho said. ‘

   

 

Infant
receives

five new

organs

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Doctors’ at Children's Hospital
said only time will tell whether a
rare five-organ transplant per-
formed yesterday on a 3-year-old
New Mexico girl was successful.

Rolandrea Dodge of Fruitland,
N.M., received a new pancreas,
liver, stomach, small intestine
and portions of a large intestine.
The doctors,also removed the
girl's spleen. S

Dr. Satoru Todo, who headed
the surgical team, said the
16-hour operation went accord-
ing to plan. ”The prognosis is
very difficult to say, but I'm ex-
pecting it to go well,” he said.

Todo said that at one point the
child's temperature‘ dropped to
31.2 degrees Celsius and her
heart stopped beating for approx-
imately one minute; however,
this was the only unexpected turn
during the surgery.

He explained that this occurred
when the new organs, which
were chilled to preserve them,
were placed into the child. The
temperature of the organs caused
the drop.

Surgeons exacted resuscitative
techniques to tackle the stopped
heart. ' -

The operation ended at approx-
imately 3:40 p.m., and Todo said
-Rolandrea was in the intensive
care unit in critical condition, but

that she was moving her hands,

and feet.

According to Todo, the fact that
the new liver produced bile was
a positive sign.

He said, ”[Ro|andrea] is doing
fine.”

As a result of the surgery,
Rolandrea will be be able to eat
solid food.

Born with an incurable disease
called intractable secretory diar-
rhea, the intestines of the girl
were unable to absorb solid food.
As result, she was forced to
receive food intravenously.

The liver problems stemmed
directly from this type of feeding,
as the concentrated protein sub-
stance she was given caused liver
troubles about three months ago.

This is the second performance
of this kind of multiple-organ sur-
gery. Last November, 5-year-old
Tabitha Foster, of Kentucky, sur-
vived six months after having five
organs transplanted. Todo

Gorbachev accepts limits on presidential power

MOSCOW (AP) — President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev bowed to
criticism of his constitutional re-
forms Tuesday, saying he will ac-
cept tighter limits on presidential
power and try to accommodate
republics clamoring for more au-
tonomy. _

Gorbachev, acknowledging the
political give-and—take forming in
the freer atmosphere he has

’ fostered, told the Supreme Soviet,

or parliament:

”Our own socialist system of
‘checks and balances’ is taking
shape in this country, designed to
protect society from any viola-
tions of socialist legality at the
highest state level.”

The Supreme Soviet is con-
sidering, during its three—day ses-
sion, a package of almost 120
articles of legislation first pub-
lished five weeks ago that Gor-
bachev says are the first major
step toward a political system

based on law, not central dictate.
But the draft laws faced stiff
criticism that they actually

strengthen the presidency, which

NEWS BRIEFS

Gorbachev assumed on Oct. 1,
against the legislature, and
strengthen Moscow's power
against that of the 15 Soviet
republics.

The unprecedented criticism of
the proposed legislation was
highlighted by the Estonian
repub|ic’s Nov. 16 ”declaration
of sovereignty” over all internal
affairs and demand to review all
new Soviet legislation. Several
Supreme Soviet deputies, includ-
ing two top officials from the Bal-
tic republics, registered
dissatisfaction Tuesday with ele-
ments of the reform.‘

FAA examines alarm
systems on U.$. jets

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
Federal Aviation Administration
will propose modifications in the
takeoff alarm systems on virtual-
ly all U.S. commercial jetliners to
guard against an electrical short
that could keep the alarm from
sounding, officials said yesterday.

The directive would apply to
more than 3,700 commercial jets.
Airlines would have until Febru-
ary to comment on the proposal,
which the FAA would then be ex-
pected to make final.

Maine senator to be
new majority leader

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate
Democrats Tuesday elected

George Mitchell of Maine as their
majority leader and the man who
will guide the chamber through
its coming skirmishes with
George Bush's White House.

Mitchell was elected in the
closed meeting by a unanimous
voice vote after first narrowly
missing a majority in his race
against Sens. Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii and Bennett Johnston of
Louisiana.

Mitchell, who was appointed
to the Senate in 1980, was elect-
ed in 1982 and re—elected earlier
this month, will succeed Robert
C. Byrd, D—W.Va., who decided
to step down as majority leader
to become chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee.

Foreign travel alone can

”Excuse me, don't I know you
from somewhere?” I asked,
knowing I had never seen the
blond young man before.

”Bitte?” the German traveler
asked, looking confused.

Not understanding what he
said, I quickly apologized and
returned to my seat in the Paris
train station's cafe.

I sat silently ripping a styrofoam
cup, embarrassed that my loneli-
ness made me use pickup lines
on strangers.

Why had I decided to travel in
Europe by myself?

Since I wanted to see different
places without worrying about
where a traveling companion
wanted to go, I thought traveling
alone would be a good idea — as
well as exciting.

But, six hours into my great
traveling adventure, Iwas strand-
ed alone in a Paris train station,
only knowing how to say ”mer-
ci” and usually not even
pronouncing that correctly.

Earlier that afternoon, I had
learned from an impatient ticket
clerk that there weren't any avail-
able seats on the I I p.m. train to
Barcelona, Spain. The next one

didn't leave until the following
morning — and the clerk said he
doubted I would be able to get on
that one.

The man at the information
desk laughed at me and then ig-
nored me when I asked if there
were any cheap hotels near the
station. The police officers shook
their heads and looked past me
when I asked aboutyouth hotels.

I panicked. My first impulse
was to call my mom in Erie, Pa.,
and cry. However, that meant

that my family would find out
that I was traveling by myself —
exactly what they had forbidden
me to do.

Instead, I went to the women's
lavatory and stood in a stall try-
ing to figure out what to do. My
only option was to spend the
night in the train station.

I spent the first four hours sit-
ting in the cafe using my few
French francs to buy overpriced
coffee.

for an American - actually any-

By I0 p.m., I was bored and

An emaciated victim of
AIDS, lying on a hospital bed
breathing with the aid of an
oxygen mask, illustrated last
night's AIDS lecture in'the
William Pitt Union.

”This picture shows why
we're here,” said Dr. Richard
P. Keeling, chairman of the
task force on AIDS for the
American College Health As-
sociation. Keeling spoke to Pitt
students about the the in-
fluence of the virus on college
campuses.

The seminar was part of the
Our Choice Program, spon-
sored by the Panhellenic As-
sociation and the
Interfraternity Council.

Keeling’s goal was ”to turn
AIDS into something that is
manageable/’, Keeling at-
tempted to create this image of
AIDS by creating four ”reali—
ties” about the virus which are
pertinent to college students.
These were:

0 People in college do have
the AIDS virus.

0 Most infected students
don't show signs of the
disease.

  

AIDS prevention discussed

0 There is fear among col-
lege students.

0 AIDS is transmitted on
college campuses.

Citing the first two realities,
Keeling said that the reason
many people do not recognize
a problem on college cam-
puses is due the the fact that
”AIDS tends to be invisible on
college campuses.”

He said that because the
AIDS virus has an incubation
period of about five to seven
years, most people do not
show signs of the virus until af-
ter they graduate.

walked quickly down the plat-
form to the end of the train, that
she was experienced in hopping
trains.

She stopped at the entrance to
one of the train carriages, looked
around to see if a conductor was
coming andthen quickly board-
ed, pulling me after her.

We walked down the corridor,
searching for empty spaces on the
reservation signs posted outside
the small cabins.

We found the only two in the
last section of the train, and the
French girl quickly slipped into
the seat, pulled out a magazine

and motioned for me to sit down

 

beside her.

For the next hour, as the other
travelers started to board the
train, the French girl and I looked
at her fashion magazine and tried
to speak to one another.

When the conductor stopped
by our cabin to check our train
passes, the French girl said some-
thing in French about the reser-
vations and then he left.

By midnight, we were sound
asleep and on our way to Spain.
When I woke up a couple‘ of
hours later, my traveling compan-
ion had already gotten off the
train at an earlier stop.

Collier leaves Pitt post to take Olympic job

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Shelton Collier has announced
his resignation as head women's
volleyball coach at Pitt in order
to accept the position as the No.
1 assistant of the U.S. Women's
Volleyball Team.

Since 1985, Collier has served
as an apprentice coach with the
women's national team and was
responsible for scouting the op-
position in the 1988 Olympics.

Collier has coached the Lady
Panthers for the last nine seasons,

during which time he has com-
piled a remarkable 296-93
record.

In addition to leading Pitt to
four Big East titles (1 982, '84, '86
and '88) in seven years, Collier
has taken his team to the NCAA
tournament four times (1982, '84,
'86, '87) and the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Wom-
en tournament (a predecessor of
the NCAA) once, in 1981.

More than anything, Collier is
responsible for raising the level of
Pitt volleyball to one of national
prominence.

Volleyball team loses
in Texas tournament

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

ARLINGTON, TX —— A deter-
mined group of Lady Panthers
traveled to Texas last weekend in
search of a berth in the NCAA
Volleyball Championships. Un-
fortunately, in spite of a valiant ef-
fort, the Pitt women fell just short
of their goal in the Texas-
Arlington Classic.

Playing the host and seventh-
ranked Mavericks from Texas-
Arlington on Friday evening, the
Lady Panthers lost in a titanic five-
game shootout.

In game one, Pitt played near-
Iv flawlessv llevball jn defeating
fhe Mayeficis by a 15-2 count.
The Lady Panthers registered 13
kills in the game with nary a hit-
ting error, while brandishing an
incredible .591 hitting per-
centage.

Texas-Arlington jumped off to
a 7-2 lead in game two before Pitt
rebounded‘ to tighten things up at
12-10. At that juncture, the
Mavericks scored three consecu-
tive points to take the game.

The Lady Panthers fought back
to take game three by a 15-11

score behind the power hitting of
Denise Frawley and Julie Sheils.

The team from Texas-Arlington
came back once again in game
four. Putting their offense in high
gear, they turned a game dead-

locked at four into a decisive 15-6’,

win.

Game five was for all the mar-
bles, and the Lady Panthers start-
ed the fateful match with a 6-4
lead before the Mavericks
finished strong to post a 15-9 win.

Despite a crowd that hooted
and hollered, and used bullhorns
while they served, the Lady Pan-
thers performed admirably.

“Pitt was tough. They were the
best serving team we've seen in
the country. With their backs up
against the wall, they played an
inspired match. We were just
happy to get the win in a tough
five-game match,” said Texas-
Arlington coach Lisa Love.

The Lady Panthers received
sterling performances from a
number of individuals. Frawley
led the team with 19 kills for the
match while Sheils tallied 17.

Swimmer Kozlina

By Scott Campbell 5

Staff Writer

As this Olympic year comes to
a close, and we have honored
those local athletes who brought
home the gold, like Roger King-
dom and Suzie McConnell, the
time begins for looking forward
to 1992. How will Western Penn-
sylvania be. represented at Barce-

lona? Are there any local athletes
out there waiting in the wings for
a chance to display their talents
on an international stage?

Mike Kozlina is one such ath-
lete who just ‘might get that
chance. Kozlina is a junior on the
Pitt men's swimming team and is
ranked third in the NCAA and
27th in the world, says his coach,
Dick Bradshaw.

”We are sorry to see Shelton
|eave,” said Carol Sprague, Pitt
assistant athletic director in
charge of women's sports.

”First, he moved our program
from one respected in the East to
one that was respected through-
out the region, east of the Missis-
sippi. Then he took it from
regional success and turned it
into’ a nationally respected pro-
gram,” she added. '

Before assuming the reins of
the Pitt program in 1980, Collier
had built a strong resume for a fu-
ture coach.

He played setter for Ohio State
from 1974-77, leading the Buck-
eyes to national prominence. Fol-
lowing graduation, Collier spent
the next three years as an assis-
tant coach of women's volleyball
at Pacific, Cincinnatti and Ohio
State.

”I was the first assistant coach .

at Ohio State in 1979 and was
given a lot of credit for their sixth-
place finish in the national cham-
pionships. We had a couple of
wins against Pitt that year, and I
feel that influenced their decision
to hire me,” recalled Collier.

 

This past season, Collier turned
in one of the finest coaching per-
formances of his career. He took
a young, relatively inexperienced
Pitt team (with only two seniors)
and molded it into a formidable
unit which narrowly missed
qualifying for the NCAA tourney.

The personable Collier has
long been noted for his strong
rapport with players, and his

teams, historically, have been

close-knit and cohesive.
”We heard early in the season
that there was a chance that Shel-

looking towards Olympics

Although he is not making any
promises, Kozlina feels that he
has a good chance of being an
Olympian in '92, and doing so is
one of his life's goals.

”|t's really important to me,
and it will be until I quit swim-
ming,” Kozlina says.

Kozlina has bigger dreams than
that, however; he does not just
want to make the team.

”I'm not satisﬁed yet, I want to
be a world record holder some-
day, preferably in the 100-meter
backstroke," says Kozlina.

He came close to accomplish-
ing his first goal this past summer,
when he made it to the finals of
the 1988 Olympic trials. The top
two finishers made the trip to
Seoul, while the rest go home
knowing that they have four years

to improve. Kozlina finished
eighth at the trials, a placement
that he hopes to better by at least
six places four years from now.
’’I guess I was jealous, watch-
ing the Olympic team march
around the pool, with me not be-
ing in line," Kozlina says.
Kozlina had back surgery for a

slipped disc and was not able to -

What are the possibilities of football league?

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Can the possibility of an
Eastern football league become a
reality?

If it were up to Syracuse coach

Don MacPherson, the answer

would be a strong and resound-
ing "yes."

"I think that we should find a
way to get the athletic directors
together and make a damn
league out of this thing [Eastern
football],” MacPherson said.

His chief complaint was that
the 6-4 Pitt Panthers were not
offered a bowl bid this season.
MacPherson feels that the Pan-
thers were a good enough team

to deserve a bid, but, because
they are an independent, they
were not given the chance.

"They deserved a bowl game,”
MacPherson said. ”Especially. if
you look at some of the teams
that were picked. I think it was a
pure lobbying tactic, and we
should not have that in college
football.

”We are going to have to work
on that this winter and during the
summer so it doesn't happen
again — even if it is just a league
in name only — and put some
standings in so the bowl people
will be enhanced by it. It's a ter-
rible, terrible thing that Pitt was
left out." -

An Eastern league has been

talked about before, but nothing
ever materialized. Then the Big
East came along and schools such
as Syracuse, Pitt and Boston Col-
lege jumped on the boat. That
squelched the possibility of a
football league.

”One thing thatl have seen in
the East is that it is impossible to
get everybody together," Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried said. ”If
somebody doesn't get everybody
together, there won't be an
Eastern football league.”

One problem that slows the
possible league formation is that
schools get to keep any and all
money that they receive from a
bowl game. In a conference, the
money is split between all the

teams. As independent schools
get better and better, they won't
want to share the winnings.

For example, this season West
Virginia will make over $2 mil-
lion for playing Notre‘ Dame in
the Fiesta Bowl. They would not
want to split up what is rightfully
theirs.

”That is the greatest advantage
to playing independent football,”
Gottfried said, ”You have a
chance to pick your own bowl.
I look at being an independent as
being a plus right now. It's not the
only thing you are playing for,
but you are playing for a chance
at the national championship,”
he continued. ' *

MacPherson is in complete dis-
agreement with Gottfried when it
comes to a league formation.

”The ADs have to get together
and do something,” MacPherson
said. ”It would be like a dream
fulfilled for those who love foot-
ball in the East. I think the wave
of the future is conferences by
sports. I think we could have a
great Eastern conference, and I
think there are teams out there
who would be interested.”

Does MacPherson see this hap-
pening sometime soon?

‘“We|l, at my age, I hope it hap-
pens before I die."

ton would go with the Olympic
team, if he had the chance. It is
upsetting; I feel like I am losing
one of my best friends,” said
junior outside hitter Kelly
Matheis.

”We [the team] are totally ex-
cited for him. He is one of the
best coaches and he deserves to
be where he is going,” she
added.

Sue Hoover, Pitt assistant
coach under Collier the last two
seasons, commented on her men-
tor, ” This is a great opportunity
for him, to be able to work with
the national team.”

”He is very knowledgeable of
the game, and he knows strate-
gies. I'm happy for him, attaining
a goal and dream of his,” she
added.

It is understandable that there
is some anxiety among the Pitt
players as the immensely popu-
lar coach moves on.

’’I’m happy that Shelton has the
Olympic opportunity, one that he
has always wanted. However, in
a lot of ways it will be a bit in-
timidating with a new coach
coming in for my senior year,”
said junior Lori Silk.

‘As far as two former Pitt play-

.ers are concerned, Collier’s

departure should not hamper the
development of the Lady Panther
volleyball program.

’’I’m really happy for Shelton.
Shelton has established Pitt na-
tionally and with the strong team
returning, recruiting shouldn't be
a problem for the new coach,”
said Noreen Coughlin (Pitt
1985-87).

’’I think it's a big loss for the Pitt
program, but I know Shelton
would not leave the team without
leaving it in capable hands,” ob-
served Louise O’Shaughnessy
(Pitt 1984-87).

thinking the Panthers had one in
the bag.

”I don't think the crowd got be-

them to, and they're going to
need every edge they can get, es-

pecially on this floor,” Deane
said.

Siena stole an inbounds pass
with three seconds remaining
and translated it into the winning
basket.

0 However quietly, the Pitt
football team will finish its season
this Saturday at Syracuse. The
Panthers, who were denied a
postseason bowl bid, can finish
no worse than 6-5.

So why are the Iowa Hawk-
eyes, 6-3-3 over the regular sea-
son, playing in the Peach Bowl?
Does Iowa have a larger TV mar-
ket than Pittsburgh?

Ironically, the Hawkeyes will
play North Carolina State, the
same team that absolutely ruined
Pitt's chances of a bowl bid with
a 14-3 victory two weeks ago.

0 Pitt's gain may be Kansas
State's loss. Panther defensive
coordinator and secondary coach
John Fox was a candidate for the
KSU head coaching job, which
was filled Monday by Iowa offen-
sive coordinator Bill Snyder.

Fox has made the Pitt defense
one of the most impenetrable in
the country over the past three
years. His players have nothing
but praise for him and his

While Fox surely is a worthy
head coach, Pitt should try to
hang on to him for as long as
possible.

headlines recently. John Calipari,
former assistant to Paul Evans and

Michele Adamson was a defen-

With an unexpected second-
place finish at the Metro Invita-
tional at Navy, Pitt's men's gym-
nastics team has a bright outlook
for the upcoming season.

Of seven teams, Navy finished
first, scoring 261.95. Pitt placed
second with 243.55, and William
and Mary was third with 233.70.

”I thought we were in fourth or
fifth place,” said head coach
Frank D’Amico. ”WiIIiam and
Mary and Cortland are both
strong, and I really thought they

were ahead of us. I don't know
if this is a good ‘indicator for the
year, but it's a good start.

”The team competed excep-
tionally well this early. We made
mistakes, but as a whole, we did
well.”

Several Panthers showed
promise in their efforts. Among
them, freshman Pat Murgolo won
two events, the floor exercise
with a 9.2, and the rings with a
9.25.

”Our freshmen are holding us
together,” said D’Amico. "Mike

swim at full strength for six
months. He slipped the disc in
the fall of 1986 while lifting
weights and was hesitant to have
it operated on. He finally did
have the operation four months
later, on Dec. 16, 1986.

”I thought the operation was
going to be bad, but the worst
part was sitting around in the
hospital doing nothing,” says
Kozlina.

Well, not exactly ”nothing.”
He had to undergo two months
of physical therapy before he
could even get back in the water
again. He was not back swim-

ming competitively until that

summer, 1987.

“They took the disc right out,
and it bothers me every now and
then, but not so often that it's real-
ly bad,” he says about his back’s
present condition.

Kozlina started swimming at
the age of 8 in summer leagues
around his hometown of A|iquip—
pa, Pa.

He swam at Hopewell High for
four years under Coach Bob
Klemmer, and the two became
good friends. Kozlina says that
Klemmer, along with his parents,
has been the biggest help in his
swimming career.

Kozlina won both the 100 but-
terfly and 100 backstroke state
championships in both his junior
and senior years. .

Naturally, Kozlina received
swimming scholarships from
several schools. He did not
choose Pitt at first, however;
rather, he chose Texas A&M.
Kozlina swam there in his fresh-
man year, finishing third in the
conference in the 100 back-
stroke.

 

But the next fall was when he
slipped the disc. That was not his
only problem at A&M.

”I didn't really get along with
the coach there,” Kozlina states
flatly. He transferred to Clemson,
another school with a top swim-
ming program. But he never
swam for the Tigers.

’’I kind of jumped into that. I
really didn't like the university. It
wasn't my type; it was out in the
middle of nowhere. It was really
boring there,” Kozlina says.

Meanwhile, his high school
coach, Klemmer, had accepted
an assistant coaching position at
Pitt, so Kozlina decided to come
home and reunite with Klemmer,
who had also coached Kozlina
during the summers.

, ”He’s helped me a lot, in and
out of swimming,” says Kozlina.

Because of NCAA rules, Kozli-
na’s transfer to Pitt caused him to
sit out last season.

”I didn't feel like part of the
team,” Kozlina explains.

This season, Kozlina is compet-
ing for Pitt and doing an excellent
job. Not only is he consistently at
the top of the backstroke event,
but he is the man that Bradshaw
goes to when he needs to win a
crucial event.

’’I can put Mike into any event
that we need to win, because I
know that he can win it for us,"
says Bradshaw.

”Yeah, I'll do anything to help
the team. I just try to help every-
one by going out there to have
fun and win," Kozlina says.

As for immediate goals, Kozli-
na wants Pitt to be crowned the
Big East champion. That should
not be hard, since Pitt has won
the title every year since joining
the conference. He hopes to win

the individual Big East backstroke

title and one other thing.

’’I want to win the NCAA
Championship,” he says emphat-
ically.

He will try for that in the 100
butterfly, where he feels that he
is ranked in the top eight in the
country, as well as the back-
stroke. That may seem like a lot
of goals, but Kozlina is not one
to rest on his laurels. Rather, he
always seems to look forward,

iputting past successes and

failures behind him.

’’I don't like losing, but I don't
pout about it, as long as I know
that I tried my best. I don't want
to get too high on a win, or too
low on a loss; I just try to stay in
between the two,” Kozlina says.

While waiting to start a race,
the only thoughts going through
his mind are of keeping his
strokes ”nice and long.”

”I don't feel nervous, but I
don't feel "that confident either;
you can always get beat,” says
Kozlina.

You have one night.

Itlseems unfair. The genius had all that time. While you have a few
short hours to learn your sun spots from your satellites before the
dreaded astronomy exam.

On the other hand, Vivarin gives you the definite advantage. It helps
keep you awake and mentally alert for hours. Safely and conveniently So
even when the subject matter’s dull, your mind will stay razor sharp.

If Galileo had used Vivarin, maybe he could have mastered the solar

system faster, too.

shape, Kozlina and the other
swimmers start their day at 5 a.m.
on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays. They have swimming
practice and weight training from
5:45 to 7:15 a.m. At about 7:30
a.m., Kozlina comes down the
hill to eat and attend classes; then
it's back up to practice from
about 3:30 to 5:45 p.m. every
weekday.

’’I dread every morning, getting
up at five; it's a bummer,” he
says.

Sundays are the only days that
he has off, and he likes to ”sleep
in and watch football games.”

Kozlina is a psychology major
and admits it is not easy to jug-
gle both school and swimming at
the same time.

”Sometimes it gets tough when

you've got a couple of tests in
one week, and when you also
have practice, it gets to you after
a while,” he says.

After ‘he graduates, Kozlina
hopes to enter graduate school at

Pitt and eventually become a psy- .

chologist. He will also continue
to train for the 1992 Olympics
here with Klemmer.

During the summers, he will try
out for the national team, which
competes in the World Champi-
onships every year around the
world.

’’I think the best swimmers in
the world are here in the United
States,” he says.

I With a little luck and a lot of
work, Kozlina may get to prove
himself right in 1992.
