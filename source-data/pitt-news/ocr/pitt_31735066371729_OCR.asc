 

Phil sees
shadow again

PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (UPI)
-— To the boos of shivering onlook-
ers, groundhog Punxsutawney Phil
emerged from his burrow Saturday,
looked over his furry right shoulder
and saw the legendary shadow that
means six more weeks of winter.
Phil came out of his specially built
burrow, a box set into a rocky hill
called Gobbler‘s Knob, into the
glare of a TV at 7:28 a.m. The
temperature was about 20 degrees
and there was I2 inches of snow on
the ground. According to a ground-
hog at the Philadelphia Zoo, Punx-
sutawney Phil was mistaken in
predicting six more weeks of winter.
Peanuts stuck her nose out of her
burrow, looked around and saw no
shadow, which legend says means
that spring is just around the corner.
The zoo said that although male
gophers usually do the prognosticat—
ing, Peanuts is qualified for thejob.

Killer of AIDS
virus found

(U PI) — There has been an appar-
ent breakthrough in the prevention
of AIDS. California reseachers have
recently announced that a substance
has been discovered that kills the
virus‘believed to cause the incurable,
fatal disease. The Mariposa Foun-
dation said that the substance is
found in most commercial spermi-
cides. The Center for Disease Con-

the foundation on the four-year
study, confirmed the announce-
ment. Dr. Donald Francis of the

Chef Franey

honored by
feast

NEW YORK (UPI) — What kind
of menu would five of France’s
greatest chefs prepare to honor one
of their peers? The Greater New
York Chapter of the March of
Dimes Birth Defects Foundation
asked five chefs to pay homage to
Pierre Franey. the American-based
food expert from France, through a
black-tie fundraiser dinner at the
Tavern on the Green on Feb. 12.

For an appetizer, Paul Bocuse of
Lyon will prepare sweetbreads with
truffles. Alain Chapel of Moinnay
will be responsible for the soup
course —— frog leg soup with white
beans, truffles and chives. Roger
Verge will prepare the seafood
course, lobster in sauterne sauce,
while Jacques Maximin will prepare
the meat course, lamb nicoise. And
Gastone Lenotre of Paris has prom-
ised a surprise dessert. The dinner
will be washed down with cognac,
two French and two California
wines. The cost to guests: $500 a
plate.

Proposal for

used to certify doctors, lawyers and
other professionals.

AFT president Albert Shaker
plans to convene a panel of educa-
tion experts to draw up preliminary
plans for such a test, which he hopes
could be administered to new
teachers by I990.

Asked if a major goal of his pro-
posal is to “elevate teacher income”
as with other professions, Shaker
said it is and added that it is also
aimed at achieving “the same quality
and standards that go along with it."

Teachers are now among tne low-
est paid professionals, with an aver-
age salary of $22,000 annually. The
figure is cited as a major reason why
the best and brightest graduates seek
employment in other fields.

About 30 states now administer
their own tests, which Shaker calls a
“joke,” since they only determine
whether or not a teacher has min-
imum competency — a sixth grade
teacher must understand sixth grade
math.

Shaker‘s proposed national exam
would test teachers’ subject knowl-
edge as well as their ability to reason.
It would also require an internship
of one to three years.

Restaurant
tells customers
to cook it

themselves

DELEON SPRINGS, Fla. (UPI)
—~ If you have a complaint or com-
pliment for the chef at the Old Span-
ish Sugar Mill Grill and Griddle
House in DeLeon Springs, Fla., you
need never leave the table. That's
because the customer is the cook.

The mill, housed in a restored

Special interest stories from the wire

sugar mill a short walk from the
warm waters of DeLeon Springs, is a
do—it-yourself restaurant where the
food is provided but the cooking is
not. Each table in the small restau-
rant has an electric griddle
embedded in its center. The specialty
of the mill, which is open only for
breakfast and lunch, is pancakes —
all you can make and all you can eat.

Eaehtable receives two pitchers of
pancake batter, early American
style, made with unbleached white
flour plus a blend of five stone-
ground ﬂours, and more is provided
according to appetite. The flour for
pancake batter and homemade
bread is made in the restaurant's
own gristmill. All the pancake trim-
mings, including blueberries,
banana slices and applesauce, are
available, as well as sausage, bacon,
ham and eggs. Pitchers filled with
raw honey, maple syrup and unsul-
phered molasses are on each table

Whatever the combination, all the
cooking is done by the customers at
the tables. Sandwiches and salads
are available for the less daring, but
most people choose to cook their
own meals. Perhaps suprisingly,
there are few scorched pancakes or
singed sausages. With a seating
capacity of only 60 and a price of
about $3.50 apiece, the restaurant is
often filled, especially on weekends
when regular customers from as far
away as Orlando make the 45-mile
drive.

The mill itself is more than I50
years old. It sits nestled among palm
trees and live oaks in DeLeon State
Park, a,52—a'cre spread with a nature
trail and small camping area 30
miles west of Daytona Beach. A
wildlife refuge sits next door. At the
heart of the park is the mill and
springs, which pumps 16 million gal-

Student press freedom upheld

continued from page six
the student press First Amendment
model of the relationship between
editor and publisher. The student
model requires this: Since the pub-
lisher is the university‘s chi¢.fadmin-
istrator and his allegience lies
outside the First Amendment, the
First Amendment protection lies

with the editor, whose obligation is
to the ethics —of journalism, who
must be free of obligation to any
interest other than the public‘s right
to know the truth. The publisher
cannot censor the editor. On cam-
puses where the model is enforced,
courts have not dictated; instead, the
institutions have recognized that the

model is the correct one. it is a
model that ought to be considered
by the non-student press, where edi-
tors are still trained and still practice
the profession of journalism where
the publishers’ primary allegience is
to the corporation they serve rather
than to the newspaper, its ethics and
its readership.

practicing violence.

“Against what were we seen as
violent?“ asked Berrigan. “lt escapes
me how to be violent against the
ultimate violence.” He called the
facility attacked by the Plowshares
group a “nuclear Auschwitz” and
invited the audience to join him in
similar acts.

Berrigan was prompted to com-
ment on his trip to Nicaragua last
year. He stayed at the religious com-

munity founded by Ernesto Carde-
nal, the Nicaraguan minister of
culture, and a priest scolded by Pope
John Paul II when he visited that
country. Cardenal was a protege of
Thomas Merton. Berrigan said Car-
denal was expelled from his Jesuit
order due to “pressure brought from
the Vatican." .
Berrigan said he toured areas of
conflict in both Nicaragua and El
Salvador. He described the trip as
“an intense learning experience. We

LEARN...AND EARN MORE THAN
$900 a MONTH

were in some of the most terrifying
areas  and saw a lot of bloodshed."
He said the people therejustified the
violence by saying they were fighting
for survival. But Berrigan criticized
priests that claim the conflict is a
“just war.” He said he finds it “intol-
erable, priests justifying revolution
in the name of Christ.”

He said he was not condemning
the “theology of liberation" popular
with Latin American clerics. He said
he was condemning only violence.

Crime Update

By Sam Thompson
The Pitt News

Pittsburgh Housing Authority police officer Royland Hughes was
injured last Monday in the Trees Hall riﬂe range. Hughes was taken to
Presbyterian-University Hospital where he was treated for shell frag-
ments in his chest. The injury occurred during a scheduled firearm
re-qualification.

A Sony Trinitron color TV, an RCA portable TV and a luggage bag
were reported missing by lwa Gbobanigi Tuesday. The Pitt student
later received a call from an unknown male who said he had found his

. TV. Gbobanigi told the caller to contact the police.

At 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday a black couple in their early 30s swindled a
Mr. Donut waitress for $57. The couple reportedly ordered one dozen
doughnuts and paid with a $20 bill, then chose to pay with another
bill. By asking for varying amounts of change the man was able to take
her money.

first time since she suffered a groin
injury several weeks ago. She said
she is unsure whether she will be able
to compete in every event next week-

Another battered gymnast, Katie
Monaghan, competed only in the
vault and floor exercise due to.sev-
eral nagging injuries that have ham-
pered her performance this season.

To say the least, it was a painful
meet for the freshman from Wilkes
Barre, Pa. “I’m hurting," she said,
and with good reason. With shin
splits, hurt ribs and a “bodyache"
sustained in a spill she took on her
first vaulting run, it comes as no sur-
prise that Monaghan is scheduled
for an appointment with a doctor
tomorrow.

Of her performance Friday she
said, “I did all right, but nothing too
great. I competed in the floor and
vault and I crashed on my first vault
attempt — it hurt really bad. But I
think considering all the injuries our
whole team has had this year, we are
doing really well.”

Wrestlers capsized by Navy

By Mary wait
The Pitt News

The U.S. Naval Academy sunk
the Panthers’ hopes of acquiring
their fourth consecutive win this

weekend by defeating the Pitt wres-

tling team 30-1 1.

The Panthers were down from the
beginning after having to forfeit
both the 126-lb. and heavyweight
categories, forcing them to begin the
match as 12-point underdogs.
Coach Rande Stottlemyer was dis-
appointed with the loss but was
pleased with his team’s overall
performance.

“It was an encouraging perfor-
mance. They all gave as much of
themselves as they could. It was a
very good match. We stayed right
with them all the way,” said
Stottlemyer.

Joe lagnama (118 lbs.) scored
three points near the end of his
match to come up with a 16-point tie
for the Panthers. “Joe did a real
good job. He just kept plugging
away,” said Stottlemyer.

Kyle Nellis came up with a 10-3
win over Midshipman Andy Lynch
for the Panthers. “We could have
done better," said Nellis. “There
were a couple of weight classes
where we lost some close ones. The

match was a lot closer than what the
team scorer indicated. 1 think we
gained some respect from Navy
anyhow."

Another win for the Panthers was
recorded when Doug Haines man-
aged to pin’ Navy’s Andy Lewis.
Haines, who underwent knee recon-
struction two years ago, is dealing

' well with his limitations and is

becoming increasingly stronger with
every match.

Freshman Steve Frank (142 lbs.)
was dealt a 4-2 loss by Midshipman
Steve Delorso, followed by another
Panther loss. This time Navy’s
Kevin Bianchi came up on top 5-3 to
defeat Pitt's Gary Bollin. “It could
have gone either way,” Stottlemyer
said about Bollin’s defeat. “Gary has
to improve on defense. Once he gets
his defensejtogether he's going to be
hard to beat.”

Joe Bond (158 lbs.) lost to Tim
Semanski 12-2. “Joey did not wres-
tle well at all,” said Stottlemyer. “He
beat this kid last year 3-1. He just
wasn’t there.”

“Navy is a solid team," explained
Bond. f‘They just go out there and
consistently come at you. 1 don’t
think we were prepared for this
meet.”

It was one of those “close but no
cigar” matches for freshman Mike

Tongel, who was defeated by Navy‘s
Tim Curry. “Curry is ranked in the
Top 10 in the country," said Stot-
tlemyer. “Mike did a ﬁnejob against
Curry.” '

_ Sophomore Curtis Connor was
handed a 13-10 loss in the 190-113.

weight class. “Curtis needs to be
more consistent in his intensity,"
Stottlemyer explained.

The Panthers are preparing to
face stiff competition in Lock Haven
on Friday and in Penn State next
weekend, both Top 20 teams.

Swimmers wash Cleveland

The Pitt.men’s swimming and div-
ing team raised its record to 6-2 with
a 62-51 win over Cleveland State
Friday in the Ohio team's pool. “It
was pretty much an easy meet for
us," said senior Geoff Emore, who
won the 200-meter butterfly and
swam legs in the 400-meter medley
relay and the 400-meter free relay.
His brother Jim, a freshman, also
competed on those winning relay
teams, along with Rich Lucas and
Greg Murphy in the 400 medley and
Richard James and Charles Lersch
in the 400 freestyle relay.

The Panthers took firsts in the
1000-meter freestyle (Geoff Rife),
the 200-meter freestyle (James), the
100-meter freestyle (James), the 200-

meter backstroke (Rob Reddy). and‘

the 500-meter freestyle (Lersch).
Pitt finished second in the 200-

vidual medley (Greg Murphy), the
200-meter ﬂy (Geoff Emore), and

The team hosts Marshall next

Gamble, who swam for Pitt last year
and was hired early this season, said
the meet is a stepping stone to the
Big East Championships at the end
of the month.

“They’re a Division 1 school in
West Virginia and they have fairly

“In the beginning we wanted to
control the ball and runrwith it," he
continued. “They stopped it pretty
well and took a little out of our
game."

Seton Ha1l’s Andre McCloud,
who leads the Big East in overall
scoring with 19.6 ppg,1ed all scorers
with 25 and added six rebounds.
“We expected a close game,”
McCloud said. “We’re playing the
cellar game but everyone’s playing
like they’re undefeated."

‘Hoop Notes: Freshman Deme-
treus Gore scored six points in 11
minutes of play  Aiken was limited
to 27 minutes of court time due to
foul trouble, and he finished with
four  McCloud also ﬁnished with
four personal fouls  Junie Lewis
and Darryl Shepherd contributed
four points each  Aiken blocked
three shots and had two steals.

The Pirates have a pair of theives
in senior Mike Jones and junior
Ricky Burton, as Burton hadrfive
steals and Jones four, but they also
led in the turnover department with
three and four, respectively  Bur-
ton scored l3 and pulled down seven
rebounds  freshman Mark Bryant
added ll points and four rebounds.

Pitt shot 55.1 percent from the
field and 55.6 percent from the foul
line, while Seton Hall hit on 42.1
percent from the field and 70 percent
from the line. Pitt heads across town
tonight to play Duquesne, then trav-
els to Providence Wednesday.

Ailing gymnasts

finish 3rd in meet

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

The women‘s gymnastics team
finished third in a three—team meet
held at Fitzgerald Field House Fri~
day night. Wait, it’s not as bad as it
sounds. The top two teams at this
meet —— Florida and Michigan State
— are also two of the top teams in
the country.

The women were in contention for
a second-place finish until the floor
exercise, the final event of the meet.
and a sore spot with the team all
season.

“Basically, Michigan State pulled
away from us on the floor exercise,"
said head coach Donna Sanft. “The
floor is where we have been having
trouble all season long.” And with
less than a week to prepare for
another important meet, next Satur-
day’s in New Hampshire, Sanft
plans in practice this week to put
emphasis on a few weak links in the

overall program. “In practice we'll
be concentrating on the floor and a
few other routines that have been
giving us problems this year. I think
by a little improvement we can boost
our scores by a tenth in each event,”
Sanft said.

That is not to say there were no
bright spots for the young squad on
Friday. Freshman Kim Calderone
won the balance beam event with a
score of 9.3. “I think we did all
right,” she said. “They were very
good. Florida had a lot of very tal-
ented gymnasts. Some of them even
went to the Olympic trials.”

As good as Florida was, Sanft felt
they could be even better. “They
have a very good team and l was
surprised that they fell a few times
on the beam. lguess they didn’t have
a very good meet.”

Sophomore Alisa Spector, still
getting over an injury that caused
her to see limited action on Friday,
was able to see a team that she said
“really pulled together. We did

stays  atop

Seton Hall crowd

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. —
Tenacious is one way to describe
Seton Hall’s men’s basketball team.
The Pirates managed to please the
South Orange, N. J., crowd by mak-
ing a comeback in the second half,
but it wasn‘t enough as Pitt won 64-
62 in Walsh Gym Saturday. The
Pirates are still winless in nine Big
East appearances and 9-10 overall,
while Pitt arose to 3-5 in conference
play and 11-7 overall.

Pirate head coach P.J. Carlesimo
blamed his team’s loss on missing
opportunities and falling behind
early in the game. “We had oppor-
tunities and a couple of times we
looked like we’d take advantage.”_

They failed to take advantage of
Pitt’s 26 turnovers and never entirely
made up for the point differentia-
tion, which midway through the first
half was as much as 12. “The other
reason we lost was playing poorly in
the beginning,” Carlesimo said. “We
dug ourselves big holes. It’s not the
type of game where you play 40 min-
utes of exceptional basketball, but
most of the game [you have to play
well]. Eight horrendous minutes
cost us the game.”

Pitt head coach Roy Chipman
said that it may not have looked
good but the win is what counts. “I
wish we had done it in better fashion
and I told the kids to forget about
whether it’s pretty or not,”Chipman
said.

Pitt was led by freshman Charles

Smith’s 21 points and nine
rebounds, which he accumulated
before a collision under the boards
forced him to leave the game with
6:29 remaining. Chip Watkins con-
tributed 11 points and eight
rebounds. However, it was Joey
David’s late scores that sealed Seton
Hall’s fate.

With 2:25 to go and the Panthers
ahead by four but showing signs of
crowd-weariness, David hit a
jumper from the baseline to increase
the Pitt lead to 60-54. “We let the
crowd into it and they sensed they
might win,” David said. “I got open
and hit the jump shot, and our
defense helped us win.”

When the clock read :36, David
was fouled and dropped two foul
shots through to give the Panthers a
64-62 edge.

“The thing we did best was [apply-
ing] the pressure and working hard,"
Carlesimo said, “but we fouled the
wrong guy in the last seconds. We
had a time out to set_up what we’re
going to do and we didn't do it.”

The visiting Panthers went into
the locker room leading 41-32 after
controlling the first half, but with
barely three minutes gone in the
second period, Seton Hall closed the
gap to 46-44 and the most points Pitt
ever led by after that was eight, and
then only briefly.

“They started getting some breaks
and built some momentum,” said
Pitt forward Keith Armstrong, who
added six points and six rebounds.
“The coach called a timeout and told
us to calm down and play hard
defense. Defense was a key the
whole game; it helped us keep our
lead.

Swimmers remain undefeated -

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

The women’s swimming and div-
ing team remains undefeated follow-
ing an 88-51 win over Youngstown
State Friday evening at Trees Pool.

“1 think we can start talking about
going undefeated,” said Coach
David Belowich after the meet,
which boosted the team’s record to
8-0. “We’ve only got Princeton left.
Should we beat them, it will be the
women’s swim team’s first unde-
feated season since 1976.”

In order to beat Princeton, Belo-
wich said that the team will have to
be healthy. There were seven Pan-
thers out of Friday night‘s lineup
because of the flu, including All-
America Susan Hickman and the
reigning Big East Champion in the
200—meter breast stroke, Jodi
O’Neil. Junior Jennifer Brown was

absent from the diving roster with a
knee injury.

“We’ve had 10 people out in two
weeks,” said Belowich. “The team
has done a greatjob filling the gaps,
but we’ll need everybody Feb. 16
against Princeton.”

One of those people who did a
good job filling in the gap for the
Panthers was Sue Heon, who took
two first-place finishes and one
second. She took the 1,000-meter
freestyle event in 1,011.33 and the
400-meter individual medley in a
time of 488.98. Two minutes after
the 400 IM, both Heon and Marian
Cassidy, who took second in that
event, had to get back in the pool to
swim 200 meters in the 800—meter
freestyle medley.

Heon also managed to place
second in the 200-yard backstroke
behind Tracey Pfister. “Sue has
really proven herself this year both
in her performances and with her
team support,” said Belowich.

The team got the chance to swim

some events that are not part of the
usual lineup. As a result, there were
a lot of people swimming eventsthat
they haven’t participated in since
high school. Judy Haughton and
Holly Peters both swam in the 200-
meter freestyle, which is not one of
their usual events, and took second
and third, respectively.

“I was very pleased with that
event,” said Belowich. “I know that
Holly hasn’t swam that event since
her early years in high school.”

In the diving competition, Tricia
Ney took first place on both the one-
and three—meter boards. Freshman
Cathy McDonald contributed her
firstscore of the season by taking
third on the one—meter board.

According to Belowich, the team
had to have at least 35 points after
the one-meter diving event in order
for them to continue with their
lineup changes. Things stayed as
planned. They won 48 points after
