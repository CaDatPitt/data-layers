Proposal for
NCAA program
cuts tabled until 1
summer meeting

By Christopher Sepesy
Staff Writer

The NCAA president's commission
has announced controversial new
proposals designed to cut costs in col-
lege athletic programs.

The announcement was made
Wednesday at a meeting of the
NCAA president's commission in
Kansas City, Mo.

James Marshione of the NCAA

communications department said the
measures will not be sponsored at the

. January 1987 convention of the

NCAA, but will~be tabled and prob-
ably brought up at a special meeting
of the NCAA next summer, pending
further study of the proposals.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar is one
of three members of the committee
who made the formal cost-cutting
proposals. i

Another matter of’ importance to
the commission was the continuation
of Proposition 48 in Division I

schools and the implementation of it

in Division II schools.

Proposition 48 is the requirement
of freshmen athletes to have a
minimum 2.0 GPA in 11 high school
academic core curriculum courses.

In addition, it also requires that
they have a score of at least 700 com-
bined on the SAT, or a, minimum
score of 15 on the ACT. Both of these
must be met before a freshman is
eligible for competition.

Posvar said a similar rule, Proposi-
tion 56, is of equal importance.

”Proposition 56 requires that the
student-athlete works in steady accor-
dance with the progression of a
degree,” said Posvar.

”At many of the NCAA schools,
and especially here at Pitt, it is fol-
lowed. It gives certifiable proof and
supports the fact of athletes being
bona fide students.” .

The only group to publicly de-
nounce Proposition 48 has been col-
lege presidents at predominantly
black schools who feel it is
discriminatory because blacks
historically score lower on standard-
ized tests than white students.

Posvar said he felt pleased with the
decision of the committee.

’’It is very reasonable for the staff
to move carefully and fashionably, so
as to link all of the ideas expressed

together; to get them interconnected i

now requires the staff to work hard
to acheive a reasoned outcome,” he
said.

Posvar said although it may seem
so, the proposed cuts are not entire-
ly profit-based.

”The two main sports which

‘ generate revenue are football and

basketball [at Pitt]. Most of the other
sports need to be funded. However,
the depletion of funds is not our
primary goal with the proposals. Of
course, some cost-cutting would be
exercised, but the athletic programs
would virtually stay the same,” said
Posvar.

According to Posvar, the proposals
were in the best interest of student-
athletes.

”ln reducing the lengths of the
seasons, we would avoid any unrea-
sonabledemands on the time of the
student. This is very desirable on the
part of any school. It all works out
very harmoniously.”

One person who seems to be hav-
ing trouble joining in on this har-
mony is head football coach Mike
Gottfried.

‘'1 think if cuts should be [made],
why not do it with recruiting? |.can’t
see why they would even touch the
coaching staff or the scholarships.
They shouldn't take that opportuni-
ty [scholarship] away from a young
man.” .

Gottfried said he has confidence in
Posvar’s judgment. ’’I know he'll do
the right thing eventually.”

If the measures go through they
will:

0 Over a period of three years,
reduce the total number of athletic
scholarships from 95 to 80 in football
and 15 to 12 in basketball and reduce
the number of full-time assistant
coaches in both sports.

0 Create a one-month delay in the
start of the basketball season, as well
as reduce the total number of games
played.

0 Totally eliminate fall ‘baseball
and spring football practices.

Jim Mumma, president of the stu-
dent government board, sharply
criticized The Pitt News Wednesday
for editorial comments accusing the
SGB of inactivity, and for failure to
inform the student population about
the work of the board.

”The primary attack was that
nobody knows what the SGB is do-
ing,” Mumma said in a meeting of
the SGB Wednesday afternoon. ”As

far as I'm concerned, it's the media's 1

job to inform the public.”

The Student Government Board
and Students for a Free South Africa
co-sponsored a panel discussion
Wednesday to allow students and the
public an opportunity to raise ques-
tions concerning the divestment cam-
paign at Pitt.

Professorjules Lobel of Pitt's Law

School said that in the past, internal .

policies of a foreign government
were not interfered with by external
governments or institutions.

”This day has passed in the 20th
century with the coming of World
War II, where it became clear to the

.nations of the world that what one

country does within its own borders

’’I think it's unfortunate that an en-
tire opinions page was devoted to
knocking the people of this oragniza-
tion [SGB], who do a lot of work and

spend a lot of time working with

students and administrators, when
the fault lies primarily with those
whose job it is to make our work
public,” he said.

Board member Monique Simms
agreed with Mumma, and called the
editorial comments slanderous.

”The personal slander as far as the
inactivity of the student government
board president and the board
members, it's just wrong. It's totally
out of context,” Simms said. ”The ar-
ticle I looked at personally attacked
me and, l_think, every board member
here.”

Simms requested that The Pitt
News look at minutes of the’board’s
past meetings and reconsider the op-
inion of the editorial board.

Simms went on to remind the
board of the divestment rally to be
held on Oct. 8, and asked for the sup-

is of grave concern to the other coun-
tries of the world,” he said.
According to Lobel, if the U.S.
government, universities and cor-
porations contribute to apartheid,
they must be held accountable.
”We at this university  have a
responsibility to see that it [apartheid]
doesn't continue,” he said. ‘
As of now, the advisory investment
committee to the board of trustees
has not revealed its findings, and is
apparently waiting until the Oct. 14
meeting of the board.
According to Dennis Brutus, chair-

' man of the black studies department,

students nationwide are supporting
the divestment struggle.

Brutus cited the University of
California system, which divested

port of board members.

The board unanimously endorsed‘ 
a resolution presented by the govern-'
ment relations committee calling for 
action on House Bill 6, which would  P)
require state-related colleges and" _ ' 

universities to divest from South

Africa in order to be eligible for state 7 V

funding.

The government relations commit—. ‘ 

tee will be traveling to Harrisburg to
present the resolution on Nov. 1.8.

Designs for a neon sculpture com-
memorating the

proved by the board. The design, by’
artist Jane Haskell, combines

sidestepped it.

”The fact that there is not only an.

investment committee to the board
of trustees, but that there is also an
advisory committee to that invest-
ment committee exemplifies the con-
fusion of the situtation,” said Brutus.

”The end product is so bad that

sheltered in the past — one ’Uncle

repudiate the position which is being
taken by this investment adviso
committee.” 4

WASHINGTON — As the Senate
neared a crucial vote on whether to

override President Reagan's veto of
. a tough sanctions bill against South

Africa, Foreign Minister Roloef ”Pik”
Botha warned a group of senators that
Pretoria will retaliate against U.S.
farmers if the veto is overridden.
In a call to Senator Jesse Helms,
with several other senators listening
in, Botha said that South Africa will
cut off purchases of U.S. grain if the

sanctions pass.

The call drew swift denunciation
from Senator Richard Lugar from In-
diana, who said anyone who would
try to influence a senator by ”bribery
and corruption” is despicable.

White House officials are predict-
ing that Congress will most likely
override President Reagan's veto;
Republican sources indicated that the
most votes the president could
muster was 22, 12 short of the one-
third needed to sustain the veto. One
of Reagan's staunchest supporters on
Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole, said, ”It doesn't appear
the president has enough votes.”

The House overturned Reagan's
veto Tuesday by a vote of 313-83,
and should the Senate follow suit, the-
tough new sanctions would go into
effect.

Among the proposed sanctions are:
a ban on any new U.S. investments

  
 

 

 

in South Africa, a ban on important

' export items for South Africa (such as

coal and steel) and a further tighten-
ing of trade laws.

Democratic Senator Edward Ken-
nedy summed up his opinion of
Botha’s phone call: “We should not
let the bullies and thugs of Pretoria
intimidate the Senate of the United
States.”

Longshoremen strike
turns violent in Jersey

NEWARK, New Jersey —
Thousands of longshoremen in eight
Atlantic states went on strike
Wednesday, resulting in violent
clashes between the strikers and non-
union workers, and forcing cruise
line passengers to lug their own bags
up and down gangways.

The strike is the first full-scale dock
strike to hit East Coast ports in 15
years and involves a variety of pay
cuts that shippers say are necessary
because of increasingly deregulated
competition.

At a container port in Newark,
picketers, assaulted non-union truck
drivers who tried to cross the picket
line, breaking their windshields and
dragging one driver from his cab, in-

juring his leg. Numerous incidences

Longshoremen currently receive

tract proposal, workers who handle

would receive a pay cut, dropping
their wages to $14 an hour. Dock
workers who work with cargo in con-

Gandhi unharmed in
assassination attempt

NEW DELHI, India — A lone gun-
man fired several shots at Indian
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi Thurs-
day morning. However, police said
the shots missed, and Gandhi was not
harmed.

Police described the gunman as
”an eccentric,” and do not believe
he is involved in any way with the
Sikhs, who have tried in the past to
assassinate Indian leaders.

Police said the man, whom they
would not identify, waited in a patch
of bushes all night near a spot by
which Gandhi was to pass the next
day.

According to reports, the gunman
then stepped out and began firing
shots wildly, some at Gandhi and

Aquino seeking talks
with communist rebel

MANILA, Philippines — Filipino
President Corazon Aquino said her
government still wants to hold cease-
fire talks with communist rebels,
even after the top communist leader
in the area was arrested.

Aquino did, however, order all
government troops to be on red alert
in anticipation of retaliation for the
capture of communist leader Rodolfo
Salas. Government troops captured
Salas Monday night during a raid on
a communist village.

Aquino returned to the Philippines
several days ago, after what she
called a ’’highly productive” 10-day
tour of the United States.

SGB denies allocation for concert

By Teresa Candori

Assistant News Editor

A request for funds by the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance to sponsor
a concert was denied by the Stu-
dent Government Board Monday.

”We feel that the Gay and Les-
bian Alliance was out of their
realm in requesting a concert,”
said Karen Bohichik, chairperson
of the SGB Allocations Commit-
tee. ”We looked at a description

of their purpose, and we didn't
see anything that would justify
their having a musical concert.”
The Alliance had requested
funds to sponsor a concert by
Romanovsky and Phillips, a folk
group popular among the
homosexual community, accord-
‘ ing to Alliance advisor John
Marks.
”What they write about hits
home to a lot of people,” Marks
said.

Marks said he is not very disap-
pointed about the denial for the
funds, but he disagreed that the
concert is out of the realm of the
organization.

’’I think it has relevance to the
organization,” Marks said. ’’If our
purpose is to educate the student
community and help gay and les-
bian students feel more comfort-
able with their homosexuality,
certainly this group accomplishes
that purpose.”

According to Brutus, Sullivan has

" said that if apartheid has not been

completely eradicated by 1987, he
will call for total divestment by all
U.S. corporations and institutions.

Brutus called the board's position
on divestment an obscenity and a
disgrace to the university.

According to Brutus, if by May of
1987 there has not been some
”reform” in apartheid, then the
university will ”review" the situation
in South Africa.

 
 
  
 

Donald Frazier, executive assistant
of the Black Action Society at Pitt
said, ”We [students] don't want con-
venience;,we want justice and equali-
ty for all who cry out for it.”

In light of the recent incidences of
violence in Oakland and the media

attention given to them, amember of _ 

the audience referred to an ad that
appeared in The Pitt News which
read, ”Protest gang violence in

Oakland by boycotting anti-apartheid ' I

rally.” ..

Members of the panel said there is
not much threat of the protest getting
out of hand. Lobel said the way to
prevent any violent incidents is to

' have such a massive crowd that it

would be impossible, and because of
that, students have a greater respon-
sibility to attend and to ensure that
others do the same.

The rally is scheduled for Oct. 8,

a week before the board of trustees _ I 

meets to vote on divestment.

Cost-cuts" aimed
at athletic teams

"A committee of university presidents,- including our own, met in
Kansas City to discuss proposals for the NCAA’s January policy
meeting. The proposals, another extension of the controversial Prop-
osition 48, deal with ways to cut the costs of c llegiate athletic pro-
grams and how to make those programs less demanding on athletes’
study time. - .

The committee is recommending that Pitt football scholarships be
cut from 90 to 85 over the next three years, that the full time coaching
staff be reduced from eight to seven and that the football and basket-
ball schedules be cut. It doesn't sound like such a tragedy, and in
reality it isn't. Student athletes are students first and athletes second.
Cutting back the time they spend in practices and in competition has
only their best interests in mind. Major sports such as basketball and
football are extremely expensive. Cutting five football scholarships
and dropping a full-time coach is a little more than an inconvenience.

The educational system in this country is undergoing a major proc-
ess of review and evaluation. In order to maintain the quality and
cost-effectiveness of our current system, cuts in education are
necessary even if they are painful. The parties affected always get
angry and can't seem to grasp that this is being done for the good
of education. -

Regular students in the GSPIA and the Schools of Pharmacy and
Health Related Professions, just to name a few, have seen the axe
swing down on their programs, and they have suffered through it,

Bob Travers, Sports Editor

‘ but they did survive. Why should athletics be spared the same cuts?

Pittsburgh's finest
are deserting Pitt

Several months ago, the city announced plans to reorganize the
police station system in Pittsburgh. Part of this reorganization will
be to close down a few police stations, one of them being station
No. 4 in South Oakland.

The Department of Public Safety claims that the reorganization of
the police force will make them more responsive to the needs of the
citizens of Pittsburgh, because it will increase the effectiveness of
police coverage. This will be accomplished because the individual
officers’ jurisdictions will be made larger. So instead of South Oakland
officers being the only ones who respond to incidents in Oakland,
officers from Squirrel Hill and downtown will also be available to
answer those calls. That sounds as if it should work, but consider
the length of time it can take an officer to respond to a call when
they're currently in South Oakland. Just imagine how much longer
it will take an officer to get from Squirrel Hill to here. In addition
to time, there is another way that this new policy will affect Pitt
students.‘There have always been disputes between the city police
and the campus police regarding what is the responsiblity of the cam-
pus police and what the city officers are supposed to do. The officers
who are currently stationed in South Oakland are used to working
with Pitt's police force, and over time, some of these disputeshave
been minimized. But when police from all over the city begin answer-
ing calls here, those same old problems will come back. Because
of the mayhem this plan will cause, there is no way that it can make
police coverage in Oakland, or anywhere else, more effective.

Perhaps the existing police will be more diligent in their coverage.
Perhaps there will be more officers available when a problem erupts.

- Perhaps they will do all of the things that they aren't doing now. But

it's doubtful. How can they respond more quickly when they aren't
even in the neighborhood anymore?

The safety of the residents of Pittsburgh is being jeopordized by
this plan. Officers will take some time getting used to the changes.
Things will be chaotic for at least the first few weeks. During this
adjustment period, how will police coverage improve? And what are
the citizens of Pittsburgh supposed to do while the officers are out
fumbling around in their new surroundings?

The presidential address

I'd like to take this opportunity to
respond to the comments made in
Wednesday's Pitt News (Oct. 1,
1986) concerning the inactivity of the
1986 Student Government Board. I
would like to first say that the SGB
has been far from quiet and idle this
year. Instead, we continue to be in-
volved in the major issues that affect
the students.of this university.

We spend considerable time and
effort carefully allocating the student‘
activities fee. We are involved in and
[are] at the forefront of the South
African divestment movement by
planning forums to educate students
on the issue, by supporting a large
rally in support of our position and
through my current service on a com-
mittee that has been designed by the
administration to advise the board of
trustees on the issue. We are current-
ly in the process of interviewing for
and nominating the student member
of the board of trustees. Furthermore,
SGB is investigating the implemen-
tation of an escort service for late-
night studiers. The student govern-
ment is involved in maintaining the
academic quality of the university by
being involved in the selection of the
new" provost and by investigating »

, problems with members of the facul-

ty. In addition, student government
is working to counter apathy and in-
crease awareness by encouraging stu-
dent involvement in this year's
bicentennial celebration through
voter registration drives and by spon-
soring programs designed to increase
voter awareness during this election
yean

Finally, the 1986 SGB has been in-
strumental in the formation of a stu-
dent network that consists of all
state-related universities in order to
increase our lobbying power on stu-»
dent issues.

All of these things are taking place
just this term, yet The Pitt News ac-
cuses Student Government of inac-
tivity. To me and to the other
members of the Student Government
Board, a picture of our office covered
in cobwebs is a ridiculous contradic-
tion of reality. However, The Pitt
News’ image of student government
and what actually occurs here can be
explained with the revelation of a few
facts.

The Pitt News has yet to send a
reporter to any one of our weekly
public meetings this term, despite
numerous requests from our secretary
and from myself. Also, The Pitt News
was in attendance at exactly four of
our weekly meetings between in-
auguration in January and the end of
the term in April. The reason for this,
[as] I have been told by the Perspec-
tive editor of The Pitt News, is-that

LETTERS

the newspaper is short of staff. Yet in
the same issue, an article entitled

”North Side native celebrates 52nd
year vending in Pittsburgh” ap-

peared. If these are the articles that
the limited staff members of The Pitt

News are covering, then perhaps a
re-evaluation of our newspaper's
priorities should be considered.

- It is obviously the job of the media
to keep the student body informed of
important campus events. However,
The Pitt News suggests that it is my
responsibility to purchase ads to in-
form the campus of noteworthy ac-
tion taken by the Student
Government Board. I never realized
that it was necessary to pay a student
publication to print what is clearly
news. ‘

Finally, I think it's unfortunate that
such time and effort was devoted to
criticizing the people involved in stu-
dent government (who are genuine-
ly devoted to their positions) when
the fault lies with those people whose
job it is to make our work public.

Jim Mumma
President
Student Government Board

ZBT ‘ 

I am writing this letter in reference
to an advertisement that appeared in
the classified section of your paper
(The Pitt News, Monday, Sept. 29,
1986) under the Greeks heading.
More specifically, I am referring to
the author of the letter, ”Eric” (not his
name, l’m sure). For the benefit of
those not familiar with the advertise-
ment, Eric took it upon himselfto in-
sult the national fraternity of Zeta
Beta Tau, including its 103,000
members, the entire Jewish popula-
tion and his small circle of friends, in
that order.

I, as vice president of the Beta Phi
colony of Zeta Beta Tau and a mem-
ber of the Jewish religion, took much
offense to your slurs against» my

brothers and my people. I question '

your motives, as well as your mental
stability, to start trouble with a frater-
nity as strong as Zeta Beta Tau and
to put down the Jewish population of
the world. If you have some problem
with our fraternity, I wish you would
bring [it] up personally instead of tak-
ing cheap shots at our brotherhood.
Even though that ad was printed as
an oversight by The Pitt News, it was
expected that this kind of religious
slur that appeared in The Pitt News
would not be submittedfor publica-
tion. Because of this incident, The Pitt

News has agreed to screen all ads so
that no cheap shots can betaken by
a lowlife such as yourself.

So, thank you, Eric, for allowing
yourself to be humiliated by me and
my fraternity and for putting down
you and your friends for the reason
that all of you are not Zebes. You are
obviously not Zebe material, and for
that we are glad.

Football complaints ____j

As a first-year graduate student
from ”Back East,” I was looking for-
ward to my first famous Pitt football
game. While the game last Saturday
was exciting, I found the overall at-
mosphere hostile and uninviting.

First, the little ”dance” exhibitions
by the female cheerleaders are a
gratuitous spectacle. Some profes-
sional football teams, such as the
New England Patriots, have dis-
pensed with cheerleaders altogether.
No one misses them, and it has not
harmed the team. While I am not sug-
gesting that Pitt dismiss cheerleaders,
these dances were neither cheers nor
gymnastics. I felt embarrassed and
humiliated, both as a Pitt student and
as a woman, as my fellow students
jeered and hooted at the ”girls” (as
the announcer called them). If the
spectators feel the need for this type
of entertainment, let the male cheer-
leaders join in. They can gyrate their
hips and toss their heads around, too.

Second, if Pitt has some excellent
black football players as well as an
eight percent black student popula-

‘ tion, why did I see so few blacks in
the Pitt bleachers? I do not claim to
speak for anyone but myself, but let
me suggest a possibility.

A group of fellow graduate students
and I, who had all bought tickets at
the $2 student rate, were told to leave
good — unreserved —- seats. Ap-
parently, fraternity members, who
paid the same price for tickets as my
friends [and I], had ”reserved” entire
sections for their respective frater-
nities, ignoring the fact that student
seating is on a ”first come, first serve”
basis. It may be coincidental, but the
vast majority of the fraternity mem-
bers at the game were white. If this
is standard practice, I can understand
why many minority students may feel
a reluctance to attend the famous Pitt
games.

' A -THE PITT NEWS," Friday, October 3,  R '

By John Mccombe

He decided to answer the want ad.
lt informed him that Bruce Springsteen
and the E Street Band were looking to
replace Vinnie Lopez, a drummer
whom they had sacked a few weeks
ago. The ad also mentioned that the
band possessed a coveted contract
with Columbia records. ”You know
what that told me?" remarked Max
Weinberg. ”lt told me that they were
doin’ a lot better than I was." Until
that time in l974, Weinberg's
rhythmic skills had only been tested by
several stints with New Jersey bar
bands. He also managed to feed
himself by performing at an endless
string of parties, weddings and, you
guessed it, bar mitzvahs.

Max Weinberg's fortunes changed
when he answered that want ad. He
passed the audition and eventually
filled Vinnie Lopez’ position at the E
Street drum kit. The Springsteen audi-
tions ‘lifted the drummer from the
dance clubs and reception halls of
south Jersey. He had earned the
respect of the band with his ag-
gressive playing but, more important-
ly, Weinberg was having the time of
his life — and was getting payed for

i it. "After seeing Springsteen perform

live for the first time, Weinberg knew
what he wanted: "Bruce was havin'
the time of his life. / wanted to have

His introduction to percussion was
typicallyhumble. As a child, Max en-
joyed hitting things and making lots of
noise. ltgwas a noise that was intense
enough to drive visitors from -the
Weinberg home with their hands cup-
ped over their ears. He also had idols.
An early favorite was D.J. Fontana,
the house drummer for the first Elvis
Presley band. Weinberg remembers:
"When I heard D.J.’s roll on the in-
tro to ’Hound Dog,’ l was never the
same.” But most distinctly, Max
recalls the evening that he and his two
sisters sandwiched together in front of
a February T964 screening of The Ed
Su//ivan Show. The main attraction
that evening was the American debut
of four guys from Liverpool. A broad

smile creases Weinberg's face as he
recalls: "The main reason l wanted to
be in music is because of Ringo.”

Nearly lO years after Weinberg's
first session on E Street, he shared
conversation with the man who

”changed his life." As he sat on the
front parlor of the sprawling estate of
Ringo Starr, Weinberg must have felt
a surge of pride and accomplishment.
However, the impression that
Weinberg left with me is that most of
all, he is grateful for the opportunities
that his career has provided him. He
is also determined to constantly rein-
vent himself as a drummer, and he is
quick to remember atime in his life
when he allowed his skills to wither.

lf it were up to Weinberg, he would
erase and rerecord a good portion of
the rhythm tracks on Springsteen's
Darkness on the Edge of Town, the se-
cond album that he recorded with the
band. On cuts like ”Badlands" and
the title track,.Weinberg believes that
he had lost his essential skills as a
timekeeper. Regarding his manic rolls
on ”Candy’s Room," Weinberg is
somewhat modest: ”l did pretty good
on that one.” Overall, though, Max's
playing had arownincreasingly dis-

spirited _through a negligence of the
fundamentals of his trade.

By the time of the recording sessions
for The R/'ver,ihe had sunk to the
depths. Duri_ng one of many unsuc-
cessful takes of ”Out in the Streets,"
Bruce had to take his drummer aside.
The five words he whispered must
have felt like a freight train running
through the middle of Weinberg's
skull: ”You're not cutting it, Max." For
the man who proudly calls himself
”Mighty Max,” those words cut
deeply.

Cue the fanfare from Rocky,
because this man did pry himself from
the mat. In essence, Max Weinberg
returned to the boot camp of beat. He
armed himself with a jazz professional

for an instructor and the most elemen-
tary tool in his trade —— the‘

metronome. Weinberg explains:
"The metronome is a device that
keeps perfect time, and as l said
before, that wasn't my style." Max
believes that his return to form is a sim-
ple extension of the work ethic. He
renovated his drumming skills from the
ground up, through constant repetition
of rudiments which are the primary

rhythmic patterns that beginning-

     

 
 
  

   

 

   

 

   

 
  

 

 

call or stop by:

 

ATTENTION FRESHMEN
AND UPPER CLASSMEN

drummers are drilled on.

As a result, Weinberg was able to
achieve his greatest hour .in the

recording studio. His playing on 
”Born in the USA." sounds like a

choreographed avalanche, and it is
the work that he is most proud of.
However, l2-hour sessions of

unrelented hammering on a snare 

drum do constitute an occupational

hazard. After awaking on several oc- A i A

casions with clenched fists and hav-

ing to literally pry his fingers open, . 
Max was diagnosed as-havi.ng an 

acute case of tendonitis.

The recovery was painful and

. tedious. Because of his reduced grip,

on occasion Weinberg was forced to
tie his drumstick around his left hand.
There were alsopainful cortisone in-
jections before the band's marathon
concerts and the consumption of up to
30 aspirin a day. Finally, Max con-
sented to surgery. Today, after seven
operations, he can claim to be fully
recovered. Weinberg promises that

the E Street Bands’ four—hour sets are .. 

not yet an item for the history book
of rock. T

In addition to his talents as a musi-=: .
cian, Max has also pursued a career '
in writing. He has composed The Big ,
Beat which is a collection of profiles ' s

of i2 drummers whose work
Weinberg has always admired. ’’It
was my way of shining the light on my
heroes," he said. There is also the
Christmas release of Bruce Spring-
steen and the E Street Band Live,
1975-1985. The album is a five-

record boxed set of live material that j

spans Bruce's complete catalogue.

Beyond that, Weinberg refuses to
speculate on the future. There are a
few certainties, however. The E Street

band will continue ”as long as the en- ' '

tire group pushes in the same direc-

tion.” Max also promises ti continue - ’

playing hard, though he quickly
reminded me that he is a technician
as well. This is a man who obviously

loves his work. His parting words. , ,
perfectly sum up the credo of ”Mighty .
Max": ’’I just lay down a solid 2/4 

backbeat which is, as Huey Lewis
says, the heart of rock ’n’ roll."

~Romanul conducts Four Seasons

 By David Zuchowski

Victor Romanul is the associate
concertmaster for the Pittsburgh

ff ’ Symphony Orchestra. On Sun-
“ day, Oct. 5, he will make his

professional debut as a conduc-
tor. He willlead several mem-

— bers of the Symphony Orchestra

at the Unitarian Church in

T — Shadyside in a rarely performed
 production of‘ Vivaldi's Four
”-Seasons. Antonio Vivaldi (c.

l680-l 743), known as the ”red

priest” of Venice because of his

" fflaming red hair, wrote his most
‘ r~ famous work, Four Seasons, in
. an attempt to capture the emo- -
"  tion and feeling of spring, sum-

mer, fall and winter in four
separate concerti. Of special in-
terest is the fact that four
separate poems written by an
anonymous poet or, as is more

. ‘likely, by Vivaldi himself precede

 

each musical section. Jim Cun-
ningham of WQED will be on
hand to read this poetry, which
Vivaldi valiantly tried to capture
in musical form.

in the first section, Vivaldi
wrote dulcet but energetic music
replete with bird songs and
gushing fountains in anattempt
to capture the joy of spring; but
the music soon builds to a flurry
of sound representing an oncom-

ing storm with flashing lightning-

and thunder that later ebbs into
a gentle rain. in summer man

while the air is full of sounds of

cheerily, ”This is winter, and it

cert and a few of his experiences
with the PSO.

coming concert, he commented,

listen to other recordings of the
same piece. Then l sit down with
the score and study its structure,
the different tempi, even the
state of mind the composer
might have been in when he
wrote it. l try to hear the piece
in my mind and attempt to work
it out technically, trying different
approaches to the music. Final-
ly, I decide on the one I like
best.”

On the Four Seasons he said,
”|’ve listened to the Four-
Seasons many times in my life.
The most unusual version |’ve
ever heard was one by Gidon
Kremer conducting a small"
chamber group on PBS. Most
times, for instance, the adagio in
winter is played at a slow, relax-
ed tempo with the pizzicato of
the strings suggesting water
dripping from slowly melting
icicles. Kremer played the
adagio at more than twice the
usual speed suggesting that it
must have been an extremely
hot winter day to have the water
drip that fast.

”l\/ly favorite recording was
Joseph Silverstein's performance
with the Boston Symphony O'r-
chestra on the Telarc label. l
may be biased because Mr.
Silverstein was my teacher, but
l think that his playing on the
recording was absolutely pure
and flawless. He once told me
that other violinists may play
faster and bolder, but that what
made his playing great was that
he strove for the purest ideals.
And for Vivaldi's music, the puri-
ty and sweetness of his sound
works very well.

’’In our concert at the
Unitarian Church, Jim Cun-
ningham will recite the poetry

thought to have inspired"

Vivaldi's composition. This in-
volves an interruption between
each of the concerti to allow him
to recite. I wondered about how
this might distract from the flow
of the composition. But when
you think about it, the seasons

do not end abruptly only to have,

another begin just as abruptly.
They overlap to some extent,
and l believe that the poetry
recitation can have somewhat
the same effect.

"Eventually, l’d like to pro-
duce a video of the Four
Seasons. lt would basically be a
montage of different nature
scenes depicted in each of the
four seasons and set to Vivaldi's
composition. l think it would be
a great success. After all, why
should rock and pop music be
the only forms to enjoy the lux-
ury of video!”

On practicing, Romanul had
the following to say, "Some
lucky musicians like Zuckerman
can get by on just a little prac-
tice. l understand that he only
practices for about an hour each
day. On the other hand, I have

to put in a good seven hours,

each day. l can skip a day once
in a while; but if I miss more than
that, l have to start ‘all over
again. I use a little studio of my
own in Squirrel Hill, apart from
my house, so that I won't be
disturbed. My best hours for
practice are from l l to 3 at night
when I'm usually_wide awake
and raring to go. l can get by on
very little sleep, and if I get too
much my 2- and 4-year—olds
often come rushing into my
bedroom to. wake me up."
On the large number of guest
conductors at the PSO, he con-
tinued, "Since Andre Previn left

the Orchestra, we've been
without a permanent conductor.

"So we've had a slew of con-
ductors lead us over the past
several years. With a perma-
nent conductor it's easier to con-
centrate on the material after
you've learned his style. By hav-
ing a lot of guest conductors,
you have to constantly readiust
to each of the own particular
idiosyncrasies. There's a lot of
tension involved, and it takes a
great deal of emotional energy
to become accustomed to their
different demands and the dif-
ferent ways they have of re-
hearsing."

On Loren lvlaazel, Romanul
said, "Mr. lvlaazel is amazing!

ment and you think he's just

the movement is over, he goes

More rantings and ravings from the juror of jazz

FIVIN’ AROUND
Henry Butler
MCA Impulse!

By Douglas Payne

The smartest move MCA
Records has made in the '80s
was to resurrect the impulse!
label they've owned since they
bought out ABC Records in
l977. Some priceless classics
are beginning to reappear with
a somewhat hesitant push on
developing new artists as well.
Henry Butler, one of these new"
finds, is a solid gospel pianist
with inclinations to jazz and a
heart buried in the Afro-
American ideal. At times reminis-
cent of Richard Tee, Butler
possesses a twofold skill for ex-
troverted showmanship and in-
credibly colorful finesse for
restrained accompaniment. It's
in this latter capacity where he
most resembles McCoy Tyner ‘—
and that's no accident. Butler
often mentions John Coltrane in

his liner notes as a source of in-
spiration and the influence of A
Love Supreme is at times evident
on Fiv/'n' Around. However, it
must be noted Butler's case is not
so easily closed. The range of
musicianship he handles here as
well as the variation of structures
and accompaniment possibly
suggest the creative diversity of
a Chick Corea in the making. He
even works with some past Co-
rea bandmates here. The only
dud on F/'v/'n' Around is the
gospel number "| Want Jesus to
Walk With Me" wherein Butler
vocalizes over a chamber string
section. Otherwise, the album is
an interesting sampler of his
talents. With his next album,

. however, one hopes he'll unify
his directions and expand on his
broad ideas.

other lack of originality exists in
this group. This is yourlaverage
'80s groove fusion performed far
more distinctively by Maze, D
Train and even Stanley Clarke.
Finally out of Grover Washing-

Pieces enlisted Maurice White
to reconstruct what could have
been the pallid Earth, Wind and
Fire comeback album of the
'80s. it could have worked; look
what White did for Ramsey
Lewis in the '70s. But why on the

rehash of "Careless Whisper"?
The ugliness underneath sug-

the cover-tune—to-do of the '80s

These guys get no respect.
Perhaps they get too much
respect. Maybe we're iust
waiting for Malcolm McLaren to
pop up and announce with great
pride, "Ha, pulled another Sex

To/(yo/Big Heart does,
however, seemingly deserve
respect, even though its title
strives awfully hard to prove its

sincerity. In the past, the Lounge _

Lizards have recorded with
legendary producer Teo
Macero an obscure album of
‘Monk covers, but the relative
youth and style of the septet
seems to suggest a stab at glib
trendiness. Yes, they're a little bit

Tough Guys, the newest
release from Touchstone Pic-
tures, opens today and reunites
the acting team of Kirk Douglas

T and Burt Lancaster in an action-

comedy about two ex—cons. The
film is directed by Jeff Kanew,
whose last maior motion picture
success was i 984's Revenge of

the Nerds. The script was

designed by James Orr and Jim
Cruickshank exclusively for Lan-
caster and Douglas, and both
writers were elated when the
two agreed" to do the film.

’ The story revolves around two
old criminals who find that life
has changed drastically since
they entered prison 30 years
before. The duo had become
notorious as the last people to
ever attempt a train robbery.
Upon leavin the prision, they
find themseTves treated like
children. Lancaster, who plays
Harry Doyle, is tossed into a
retirement home, and Douglas,
as Archie Long, is given a
minimum-wage iob dishing out
yogurt while wearing a penguin

phat. After only one week, both

characters become fed up with
their new lives and decide to go
back to crime. After futilely try-
ing to regroup their old gang,
who by this time have become
either deaf, crippled or crazy,
Archie and Harry decide to do
it on their own. The prize they
decide on is the same train they
were imprisoned for robbing.

and disheartening look at the
treatment that many of the elder-

to give the film a more human

To live and die in Liverpool

By Douglas Payne

Billy McRacken's not having a
good day.

The one—time gunman is bein
blackmailed by an old friend he
is later forced to kill. Making
things worse, he's arranged a lit-

tle New Year's Eve bash for his ‘

band of protestant pensioners at
a wildly out—of—the—way dive
called The Charleston. To

everyone's surprise, the rival

faction of elderly Irish catholics
show up at The Charleston for a
non-existent costume ball.

Billy is forced to face his old
adversaries and bury his demons
for good —— all in one day.

Ironically, though, the transi-
‘tion inhis life, and more impor-
tantly in his values, comes on the
day we celebrate transitions —
New Year's Eve.

No Surrender, which opened
Wednesday evening at Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers at the Fulton
and plays through Oct. l2, is
anything but a celebration,
however.

Like Brazi/, /l/ly Beaut/'fu/
Launderette and Room With a
View, No Surrender is a vivid

' and colorful statement on Anglo

values from the mother country
herself, Britain. Yet, if films like
Brazil document a glossy,

streamlined system with a dirty
engine, then No Surrender por-
trays the greasy engine in all its
glory.

The place is present-day Liver-
pool at the heart of a squalid
England, where life is languid
and lawless. Yes, all hell breaks
loose, but who in hell would
notice? Director Peter Davis, in
his feature film debut, noticed
and captured this "silent
scream,” and the results are at
once hilarious and repulsive from
the guiding force of sadness and

oom.

Quirky characters filter in and
out of this black comedy like the
soot in the air. Some are tor-
tured, some are beaten, some
are killed and some lust die. Ear-
ly in the film an old boozer sits

in a bus stop shelter below the ;- '

revealing graffiti that boasts «
"Liverpoo| sucks!" Yes, in one 
sense it sucks its victims into an -
endlessly circular maze where ~'
on exit is as non-existent as the
costume ball not being held at -
The Charleston. John, Paul, 3
George and Ringo certainly got 2
lucky. The first line to flash across I
the screen was, "A normal night 3
out (these days)," and I
automatically we're prepared I
for the worst. The new manager I
comes to The Charleston to be 
greeted b pint—sized potential i

These comic asides are offset
by a bunch of elderly people
whose motivating life—force is
hatred. The bickering idiots are
so pig—headed that the grad-
ually deteriorating groups they
belong to maniacally seek death
out. That's cool if you're Bette
Davis and Jimmy Stewart in
Right of Way, but these people
are so heartless to their enemies
that they've become heartless
towards themselves. No Sur-
render never bothers to tell you
why they've maintained the

Hatfield and McCoy thing all
"these years, yet it shouldn't have

to and doesn't need to.

These people scowl, scorn
and wave fists as naturally as
they yawn and blink. The elder-
ly are as comic as they are
revolting if only because our
perception of the aged ac-
quiesces with gentility. Even the
mirth of the old and wise is shat-
tered into the childish and stupid.
Therefore, Billy McRacken
(played by Ray McAnally) isn't
out to be a martyr in this
wasteland of apathy; he's look-
ing for redemption and peace in
his soul.

Mike (played with depth and

perception by Michael Angelis,

who bears many similarities to.

Ringo Starr) is trudging, wide-

’ eyed and comical through his

first day of management. He's

not had his best day either. In
the face of imminent unemploy-
ment, he must accept his role as
troubleshooter, the strong, silent
type and as a reserved diplomat
who's fighting a private battle of
personal integrity.

Like Billy, he will achieve his
transition by accepting or adop-
ting values which can replace
those that have thwarted his
success in the post without
sacrificing any of his own morali-
ty. Billy and Mike save them-
selves by understanding the
virtue in the souls of others and
their own virtue as well. This is
not visible to the naked eye as
Smith's camera—work so remark-
ably notes, but the moral exists:
Underneath the decay an ember
of morality burns.’

, Basically, No Surrender is
about the decay of values. Even

the name ofthe nightclub where.

most of the action takes place
suggests a reverence for
decadence. The "beautiful peo-
ple" in this filmvare the foul-
mouthed punks who violate most
precepts of humanity and who,

, by virtue of being young, are

almost glowing in a virginal light.

The elderly folks are just as
grotesque, vulgar and insane,
yet they are perceived by the
outsiders, and the audience, as
pathetic.

   

This is not hard to understand
if we evaluate our own sur-
roundings, but there is a. painful
realization in the number of peo-
ple who learn and grow in these
awful times. "l surrender," said
McRacken to his gunman'bud-
dy. "|n fact, I give up." His sur-
render is not from life, but that
which impinges upon life.
Peter Smith's film is a
fascinating voyage through a
not—very—seamy underworld with
many well—developed charact-
ers on a night that could change
all their lives. Some of the per-

formances are brilliant (especial-

-ly Bernard Hill's bouncer
character, Bernard), and some
are realistically individual. The
only complaint that can be
lodged in this effort might’ be that
the black comedy becomes too
dark (and bloody) at times and

Occasionally, if we perceive
Mike and Billy as heroes in No

Surrender, as they are the only '

ones we see who surrender, un-

realistic ideologies without sur- , ' _

the film is a brilliant study’ of the 
virtues of human honor for,

CHOCOLATE

Elvis Costello and the
Attractions

Columbia Records

By John McCombe

The king is dead. His reign
was brief. Blood and Chocolate
finds Elvis Declan Patrick
Aloysius MacManus Costello
backed with the Attractions,
reunited with producer Nick
Lowe and, most significantly,
retreating from the spare ar-
rangements and confessional
lyrics of King of America.

The new album has been
referred to as Costello's
"Beatles album,” but only a few
cuts contain the type of produc-
tion gimmicks that dominated Im-

 

 

peria/ Bedroom. B/ood and
Choco/ate would have sounded
more at home in l978, not
l9<'>8. At times, the almost nak-
ed sound suggests a Costello-
ized version of John Lennon's
P/astic Ono Band. But Costello
does manage to throw in occa-
sional psychedelic sonic
treatments, and he makes no at-
tempt to match the agonizingly
bare honesty of the Lennon
album. Needless to say, this is
an album that is impossible to
label.

The verdict on the success of
the album depends upon your
tolerance of Costello's return to
cryptic wordplay and familiar
musical settings. "Uncomp-
licated" opens the disc, and it's
tuneless and confusing — the ti-
tle is inappropriate. What would
you make of this? / asked for
water, and they gave me rose
wine/ A horse that te//s arithmitic,
and a dog that te//5 your fortune.
Scratching your head? The
album's first single is somewhat
less perplexing.

"Tokyo Storm Warning”
gallops along like a deranged
cross between the "Sesame
Street Theme" and "l9th Nerv-
ous Breakdown.” Costello
wanders from Korea to
Alabama to Australia and back

g Blood  

to Tokyo. Along the way he
shares audio snapshots of dead
/ta/ian tourists whose bodies /it-
ter up the Broadway and the
KKK who wear hoods and carry
shot guns in the main streets of
Montgomery. The song seems
to be a seven-minute narrative of
our present global nightmare
and how many people just turn
their heads because we're on/y
/iving this instant and care
nothing about the future.
Much less interesting are

I/I

' Hope You're Happy Now" and

"Home is Anywhere You Hang
Your Head," which sound like
tossed—off outtakes from Armed
Forces. The true mindbender of
the set closes side one. It's
deceptively simple title is "l
Want You," but it shouldn't be
confused with John Lennon's
similarly titled epic of anguished
desire.

Costello's song is similarly
anguished but not similarly sim-

le. lt's desperate and full of the
Bitter bile of iealousy: Did you
ca// his name out as he he/d you
down/ /t's the stupid detai/s that
my heart is breaking tor/ /t's the
way your shou/ders.shake and
what they're- shaking for. "l
Want You" is easily one of Elvis’
most moving and strongest com-
positions.

THE Pl1T NEWS, "Friday, October 3, 1986

Side two is less difficult to listen
to but is also less interesting.
"Battered Old Bird" has an
almost hushed tone and the
haunting plink of an acoustic
piano‘, but its lyrics left me
clueless. "Blue Chair" and
"Honey Are You Straight or Are
You Blind" feature the merry-go-
round sound of Steve Nieve's
Vox organ, an instrument which
he resurrected almost lO years
ago on This Year's /L/lode/. Sad-

lly, though, these two tunes feel

like old clothes. They're comfort-
able but worn to the threads.
Elvis was much more successful
when he iniected his melodies
with a transfusion of new in-
strumentation on King of
America.

Elvis Costello has always been
prolific, and maybe it's begin-
ning to catch up with him. ln
i986 alone, Costello has~writ—
ten, recorded and released 30
songs. B/ood and

and Cher's "l Got You Babe"
vaults them to the radio waves
once again. And we were beg-
ging for more.

Well, they gave us more. On
Rat in the Kitchen, their latest
release, Ali Campbell and the
boys take us to the heights of
reggae ecstasy once again. The
album kicks off with "All l Want
to Do," a horn—flourished com-
bination of vocal harmonies and
never-ceasing bass scales. This
record lifts you up, dances you
around the room and never lets
you down again until the last
note.

Sure, there are some mellow
pieces on the album, such as

"You Could Meet Somebody,",

or "Elevator," but  well, it
flows. On this record, UB40
seems to have found the happy
medium between the smooth
and the scintillating. The upbeat
rhythm of "Looking Down at My
Reflection," and the anthem—like
quality of "Sing Our Own
Song" invigorate the second
side of the album. "Don't Blame
Me" recalls "Keep on Moving"
by the late Bob Marley, from
Labour oflove. And "Rat in Me
Kitchen," probably the most
catchy of them all, thrives

around Herb Alpert's inspired-

trumpeting.
Rat in the Kitchen is indeed a
sweet morsel of reggae candy.

And it grows on you. The more

you hear it, the more it becomes
the staple record on your turn-
table. In "Watchdogs" Ali
Campbell sings,  give thanks
for your protection/ Your watch-
dogs of the night. Give thanks
for UB40. They help give reg—
gae a good name. ‘

 

GUMBO
Dr. John
Alligator

By John Mccombe
ln I968, a New Orleans-

based pianist, composer and ar-
ranger named Mac Rebennack
re-christened himself Dr. John
and emerged as a solo per-
former with an album entitled

Gris—Gris-. As wild as thisdisplay V

of pure Mardi Gras madness
proved to be, the good doctor

bettered himself four years later-
with another dose of rootsy

Bayou rhythm and blues called
Gumbo. ln a decision that con-
firms the inanity of record com-
pany executives, Atlantic
Records allowed Gumbo to’
perish in record store racks and
cruelly branded the album OUT
OF PRINT.

Fortunately, Alligator Records
has revived the doctor and add-
ed the reissue of Gumbo to its
burgeoning catalogue of blues,
reggae and rock 'n' roll. _ The
album is a tribute to the greatest
New Orleans R&B artists of the
'50s and '60s — artists like Fats
Domino, Professor Longhair and

    

em "ire 
UB40 continue to
Huey "Piano" Smith, who
gained fame with his case of
"The Rockin' Pneumonia and the
Boogie—Woogie Flu."

Dr. John's impeccable two-
chord South Louisiana ballad
style is showcased on "These
Lonely Nights" and "Blow
Wind Blow," which is a funkier
version of an original by an
obscure New Orleans vocal
group called The Spiders. The
rollicking piano runs that shape
"Blow" are layered throughout
the disc on rich beds of Dix-
ieland horns and soulful female
backing vocals. A fine example
of the loose, iam session-feel
here is the album opening "lko
lko." The song is filled with
Creole dialects and the syn-
copated sounds of a Mardi Gras

* street celebration.

Gumbo is a fine introduction to
a talented and distinctive musi-
cian. Rock 'n' roll, as we know
it today, is indebted as much to
the R&B of New Orleans as it is
to the urban blues of Chicago.

For this reason, Dr. John's Gum-
bo serves as an indispensible
historical document. It's also a
veritable parade of rock 'n' roll
mayhem, and I'm glad we've

Kirk Douglas and Burt Lan-

caster are superior actors who‘

know how to have a good time
on the screen. They both look
fantastic, though both are show-
ing signs of age. It is pure enter-
tainment to see these two
veterans relate so well
throughout the. entire film. There
seems to be a special chemistry
between them that the audience
can easily sense. Both per-
formers are magical despite the
rather dismal vehicle they have
to work with.

Harry. He faces mandatory
retirement with as much grace as
he can muster but never quite
seems to accept it. Dinners that
consist of spinach souffle and
chicken broth, bedtime at lO
o'clock and nurses watching
over him night and day are not

ting old should be like. Still he is

.the member of the pair who

hedges when the idea of going
back to crime is discussed. Even—.

that being together with Archie
is really what he wants out of
life.

Douglas is the more rebellious
member of the duo, being a few
years younger and in better
physical condition from the
weights he lifts almost every
day. He tries the night life with
a young girl who teaches
aerobics and finds it distasteful,
although he thought it fun at first.
His parole officer gets him two

Life for Archie is just not satisfy-
ing unless there is a risk involved,
which is the main reason he
resorts to crime. Douglas does it

all in the film with grace and-

Will Panthers prowl over the Owls?

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt vs. Temple. Traditionally this
game has been a mismatch, as the
Panthers usually stomp over one of
the little sisters of the poor.

But the last two seasons Pitt hasn't
been doing much stomping at all.
The tide has turned to a certain ex-
tent. Pitt’s program fizzled under
Foge Fazio, while Temple started to
make some waves under the helm of
Bruce Arians. The Owls defeated Pitt
in Philadelphia 13-12 in 1985 and

lost to the Panthers 21-17 in a close _

contest last year in the City of
Brotherly Love.

But now the tide seems to be turn-
ing toward Pitt again. The Panthers’
recent mismatches with Purdue
(41-26) and West Virginia (48-16),
coupled with Temple's 2-2 record
and its numerous injury problems,
would indicate that Pitt should roar
once again tomorrow night at Pitt
Stadium. However, the two teams’
head coaches disagree.

”Pitt is always a difficult opponent,
and it is a first-class organization,”
said Arians. ”We respect them but
we’re coming into town with the idea
we're going to win the game.”

Panther coach Mike Gottfried may
not totally agree with that statement,
but he does anticipate a struggle for
his 2-1-1 team. ”Temple is a tough
football team,” said Pitt's first-year
coach. ”They have great skill players
and their quarterback (senior Lee
Saltz) is experienced. We're in for a
tough football game.”

An in-depth analysis of the Owls
proves that to be true. Despite their
2-2 record, Temple's defeats were
two very good football teams. The
Owls lost their opener at Penn State
45-15 and were victimized at
Brigham Young 27-17 last weekend
in a game they very well could have
won.

’’I thought we played a pretty good

‘football game against BYU,” said
Arians. ”We beat ourselves in the last
seven minutes of the game.”

In between those two tough losses
the Owls crushed - weak Western
Michigan and Florida A&M teams.

The man "who makes Temple click
is its Heisman-Trophy candidate,
senior running back Paul Palmer,
who has already rushed for 540 yards
this season. However, Palmer has
never seen much success against the
Panthers. He missed last year's game

with an injury and has gained only ‘

30 yards on 11 carries in two other
games against Pitt. Hopefully, for the
Panthers’~sake, Palmer will not break

-out of that slump tomorrow.

Besides Palmer, Temple possesses
two other talented backs in back-up
tailback Todd McNair and fullback
Shelley Poole, who Arians calls ”the
best blocking back in the country.”
lf the Owls can't run though, they
could be in trouble. Saltz is a talented
quarterback, but he lost his favorite
target, Willie Marshall, who will miss
two to three weeks with a foot injury
he sustained in the BYU game. Last
year Marshall had 183 yards receiv-
ing against the Panthers.

Defensively, the Owls are shaky at

best. They have given up 105 points.

in four games. Facing Pitt's high-
powered offense could spell trouble
for the Owls. The Panthers have put
89 points on the board in the last two‘
games and their run-and-shoot of-
fense appears to be getting better.
”The run-and-shoot is something
you don't see every day,” said Arians.
”|t’s like preparing for the
wishbone." _
Hopefully, it will be as tough to de-
fend against as the wishbone
sometimes is. The Panthers’ offense
has played well under the direction
of quarterback John Congemi, who
has passed for over 200 yards in three
of the first four games. Congemi’s
main targets will be freshman Hosea
Heard and sophomore Billy Osborn,
both of whom have played well at
the receiver position. Meanwhile,
senior fullback Tommy Brown and

sophomore running back Craig

Lady Panthers headed

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer
Following a disappointing third-
place showing in the Florida Invita-
tional, Pitt's women's volleyball team
is gearing up for the Georgetown
Classic. Pitt, 10-5 overall, is in first
place in the Big East. The Lady Pan-
thers are the heavy favorite versus
conference foes Georgetown,
Howard and Maryland. Coach Col-
lier stated, ”Right now, our main
enemies are ourselves. We should be
the best team there; we should win.”
Pitt has yet to take first place in a
tournament. The Lady Panthers fin-
ished second in the Villanova Classic,

second in the Pitt Classic and third
in the Florida Invitational. Coach Col-
lier noted, ”We’ve been playing well
recently, but not well enough to win
a championship. We have the capa-
bilities to become a great team. Some
days we play like we are a great team

The Pitt football team has a good
chance to be ranked No. 1 come
January 2.

I know, readers across the campus
are now preparing to crumple this
column into a ball and toss it in the
nearest garbage can.

You may wonder how Gottfried’s
team can possibly be hailed as the
top college football team in the land.

Well, they won't be for a while.

But if they get by Notre Dame,
Miami and Penn State, as well as
beating all the lesser opponents in
between, Pitt should be ranked in the
top five when bowl bids are sent out.

Just take in the following scenario.

Three big victories in a row over

not a standard that should be used to
get a high ranking.

If‘ Pitt crushes Temple Saturday
night, however, there's a good
chance they will be ranked in the top

Coach Collier is quick to point out,
”We will have to play aggressively
and out-hustle if we are to beat_the

feated us when we were not up to the
challenge.” Agreeing with her coach,
senior Kris Wexell stated, ”We are
going to have to play our game. We
can't be taken out of our style and
forced to play in theirs if we want to

keeping you from suicide is your
date’s presence. Some dates are
suckers for a guy in trouble. Others

you just gotta take.

to see Pitt football on a beautiful Saturday

Of course, taking a date to a game
is not without its flaws. Don't be sur-
prised if sometime around the third
quarter, your date sighs and says
something like she wishes you were
Pitt's quarterback and she was on a
date with John Congemi. Happens to
me all the time, but you get used to it.

So there it is. The rest is up to you.
Temple will be the perfect date game.
It's at night, so it will seem like a real
date, and you will onlyneed to watch
the game for a quarter. By then Pitt
will have a 88-0 lead, so watching the
game will no longer be interesting.

under a blanket with your date than
with your friends — unless your
friends include Christie Brinkley and
Cybil Shepherd.

opportunity for you to brag about
your glory days as a high school

2.You will probably know more
about the game than your date,
especially if you are a guy. if you are

a girl who's date is a CMU student
 you will still know more about foot-

that throughout the game you can
show your date how smart you are.

‘Pitt students prefer night games

By Rick Fellinger

Staff Writer

There aren't very many students
here at Pitt who are disappointed
with this week's 7 p.m. starting time
against the Temple Owls at Pitt
Stadium.

Nobody is exactly rising up from
the depths of the university with mor-
tars and fire-axes to protest” this
season's second and last night home
game. In fact, most of the fans here
are pretty happy about it and-would
much rather see a football game
played at night than during the day.

Students point out good reasons
why they like their college football
played under the lights, and these

Panthers

Continued from page 17

Pitt will win a closely fought, poor-

' ly played game. When it's over, fans

will breathe a sigh of relief and plan

. to spend New Year's Day away from

home.

The victory and Pitt's 8-1-1 record
should earn the Panthers a major
bowl bid, probably to the Orange
Bowl.

Alabama will take its top five rank-
ing into the Sugar Bowl to play Penn
State for the National Championship.

But of course, that hinges on the out- I

come of the Pitt's last game.

I always feel kind of queasy the
week before the annual Pitt-Penn
State game. Everyone always looks
forward to it, but it's kind of like look-
ing fon/vard to fighting a war. You can
win,-or you can be killed.

Last year's game at home was na-
tionally televised, and Pitt was
humiliated. It was supposed to be
Foge Fazio’s last chance to keep his

Heyward have been steady in the
backfield.

A big plus for Pitt is bringing junior
tailback Charles Gladman off the
bench. Gladman, a 1,000-yard rusher
in '85, was benched last week ‘but
responded well to his new status as
afreserve by rushing for 54 yards on
10 carries against West Virginia.

The only problem Pitt has right
now is the injury situation. The Pan-
thers are down to the bare minimum
of experienced players at se‘-;;.\ral key
positions. Another loss to the receiv-
ing corps or the defensive backfield
could really put Gottfried in a bind.
What is most important for Pitt tomor-
row night is to win the game, but run-
ning a frighteningly close second is
escaping the game without any more
key injuries.

 

Attention!

brothers, little sisters and
pledges 

 see you at the tailgate
this Saturday at the
Mosque.

Don't forget to bring the

sauce!  

reasons echo those of any normal,
red—blooded, American college kid.

"Night games are definitely much
more fun," said sophomore Chris
Lackey. ’'I think everybody gets so
much more psyched up for night
games. It would be great to have all
the games at night.”

Besides the more festive at-
mosphere, Lackey also thinks that
playing a game at night against a
team that isn't considered one of
Pitt's most heated rivals can make it
more exciting. ”West Virginia was
OK during the day, but if Temple had
been during the day, it would have
been the most boring thing in the
world,” Lackey said.

Not only is the night game a sport-
ing event, but it's also more of a
social event. Freshman Lori Dorko

job, with a winning season and a vic-
tory over Penn State, but it didn't
quite work out that way.

Even the fans were humiliated, not
just because of the loss, but because
the Penn State fans sounded about 10
times. louder than the Pitt student
section.

"WE ARE — PENN STATE" has to
be the dumbest cheer since "We
want a touchdown,” but with so

thinks that night games are "a great
place to meet people.” She con-
tinued, "|t’s really great going out
after the game when it's at night,
especially when we win.”

And, of course, nobody ever
overlooks what could be the spinal
cord of the college football environ-
ment: the tailgate.

Only the most hard-core beer
drinkers don't have much trouble
waking up around nine in the morn-
ing to start partying, but most people
would rather wait until later in the
afternoon before they start guzzling
beer like it's the nectar of the gods.

”When the game's at night, it gives
you more time to drink in the after-
noon. I'd rather not get drunk at nine
in the morning,” says Jeri Billets, a
pre-med major. ”Most people are still

many people screaming it at the top
of their lungs, it overwhelmed Pitt
Stadium.

Pitt will take an eight-game win-
ning streak into Happy Valley to take
on the undefeated Nittany Lions.

Gottfried's dudes will have their se-
cond most difficult task of the season,
facing the noisy Penn State crowd
and their dully-clad football team.

If the Panthers escape with a vic-

hung over from the night before.
They're too tired to start partying in
the morning.”

Billets also thinks that part of the

reason for a lack of enthusiasm in the-

stands can be blamed on a noon start-
ing time. "Everyone’s all partied out.
It's no wonder they can't get a good
wave going when everyone’s too
beat to jump up." No matter how
partied out the fans are, the wave isn't
too popular in many stadiums any
more, no matter what the starting
time is. The wave has lasted about as
long as disco.

Despite the arsenal of kegs and
cases that roll into Oakland parking
lots before game time, there are some
more scholarly reasons for liking
night games. ''I usually study on
Saturday afternoons, and I love the

tory, they should have their pick of
the major bowls. A date with
Alabama in the Sugar Bowl would be
nice, but a rematch with Vinnie and
the Hurricanes could get the univer-
sity another National Championship.

All this will lead to Joe Paterno
finally gettinghis wish, and a college
football play-off system will go into
effect. But Pitt will have already won
a National Championship, having

19 

games,” said Dorko. "When they

play during the afternoon, it takes

away from my study time.” _

What about crime? The possibility
of a night game causing more crime
around the stadium area doesn't
worry student Carmen Corley too
much. "The security is about the
same [as compared today games]. It
doesn't bother me very much be-
cause I'm with a lot of my friends,”
said Corley. Her mind is on more im-
portant things. ”The guys look cuter
at night,” she said. No word is in on
whether or not the girls look better
at night.

One anonymous fan says that The
Pitt News "can’t print what I like to
do before night games." It doesn't
take all that much imagination to
figure out what this might be.

 

stolen it right out from under ‘Pater-
no’s sizable nasal cavity.

If there are any people still reading
this, I guess you're as much" a
dreamer as I am.

Well, when someone throws this
back into my face after the season (or
after the Temple game), I'll admit I
was wrong. '

If Pitt wins it all, just remember,

PREGAME  

PITT vs. 'l'EMPI.E,~  

PITT STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

  
   

‘Quarterback John Coemiis playing as well as ever.

”/ have been a big fan of John Congemi for a long

time.”
— Temple head coach Bruce Arians
Nov. 22, 1985

By Jim Urban

Editor-in—Chief

Bruce Arians thought he would never again face John
Congemi.’

His compliment came one day before Congemi, a
senior, was supposed to conclude his college football
career against Penn State. Pitt was trounced 31-0, and
Congemi had apparently spent his eligibility.

Congemi is back. The NCAA granted him another year
of eligibility, and Congemi beat out junior college transfer
Sal Genilla for the starting job. Again, Arians has had to
prepare for seniorJohn Congemi, who has beaten Tem-
ple twice in three tries. -

Congemi has emerged as the team leader. When the
Panthers struggled through the first two games of the
season, losing to Maryland 10-7 and tying North Carolina
State .-14-14, Congemi called a team meeting and
expressed his frustrations. Pitt has responded with back-
to-back, blow-out victories — 41-26 at Purdue two weeks
ago and 48-16 against rival West Virginia last Saturday
at Pitt Stadium.

”The big thing is to have fun,” Congemi said Wednes-
day. ”|f| was not having fun, I would not have come back.
it is fun when you win.”

Congemi began his college career three years ago with
a 35-0 victory against Temple at Pitt Stadium. The follow-
ing season against the Owls, Congemi was hurt in the
first half— the result was a 13-12 loss. Last year, he played
the entire game, and the Panthers edged the Owls 21-17.
Pitt finished with a 5-5-1 record, and Foge Fazio was‘
replaced as head coach by Mike Gottfried.

With Gottfried came a new offense — a passing offense
largely responsible for Pitt's success the past two weeks.

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1986, 7 P.M..E 

Congemi quieting critics

’’I think he has pretty much silenced his critics,” Gott‘-"

fried said.

‘ He has adjusted well to Pitt's ever-growing offense. Pitt, ’ A" A’
began the year with two running backs, a tight end and" 
two receivers, but last week they switched to a run-and-_: :7
shoot look with one running back and four receivers. It" 
is a complicated offense, but one that Congemi has easi- ?

ly grasped. ’

’’I think John Congemi has picked up my offense faster .'
— and in a shorter time — than any other quarterback-.1

l have ever coached,” Gottfried said.

”We were not sure how much we were going tolbe 
able to do [with the offense],” Gottfried added. ”We use 

each game as a yardstick. Each week we add a bit more.”

Pitt ran a complicated offense when Congemi’s, ’ *

predecessor, a guy by the name of Dan Marino, lined

up behind center. The day Pitt began fall camp, Congemi" CZ '

said he wanted things to be like the old days — the days
when Marino & Co. dominated nearly every team on the
schedule.

”We play some teams that, when we walk on the field, '_
we should know that we are going to win,” Congemi said .
at the time. ”We haven’t'felt that way in two years.’—’i‘ 
”The attitude is there now,” he said Wednesday. ”The._ . 1
people are different. You tend to play the way you prac-_ 5 ,

tice, and we practice hard.”

Congemi is currently ranked 13th in the nation in total; ._7' A

offense, averaging 242.3 yards per game. He is this
week's East Coast Athletic Conference Offensive Player
of the Week for his 16 of 30 performance (260 yards and
three touchdown passes) against West Virginia. ..

”I remember when we scrimmaged at Girard [atown
near Edinboro] during camp,“ Gottfried said. ”l saw John

do some things I really liked; I stood in the huddle —— 

I was the only [non-player] in the huddle. I liked his hud-v
dle manner, and I liked the way he would attack the

defense. I found myself seeing him in a different light.

I like him.”
