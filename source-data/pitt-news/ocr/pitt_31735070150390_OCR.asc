$tudent researchers expand neutrino knowledge

Matt Schaff
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

As you reach the end of this clause,‘ ~

trillions of research subjects have
zipped through your body. They’re
named, in Italian, “little neutral
ones.” They travel at close to the
speed of light, and they may unlock

' the secrets of _the universe — or so

hopes ateam of Pitt student research-
ers.

Under the guidance of Vittorio
Paolone, associate professor in
the Department of Physics and As-
tronomy, three Pitt students are get-
ting to know the “neutrino,” a tiny,
uncharged and poorly understood
member of the soup of elementary
particles that composes our known
world.

Using computer simulations, ju-
niors Bruce Howard and Tom Car-

, roll and post-baccalaureate student
Maher Elharake are laying conceptual
groundwork for a large experiment
in Europe that could shed light on
neutrinos and, perhaps, how we cam
to be. I ~

  

“It could potentially explain why
things are the way they are,” Howard
said. .

A strange existence

The study of neutrinos could solve
a long—standing conundrum among
physicists: Isaac Newton’s apple. Of
course, the cause of the apple’s pro-
verbial descent onto Newton’s head is
settled. What isn’t is the fact that his
apple existed in the ﬁrst place.

As odd as it might seem, the ev-
eryday matter contained in apples
and zebraﬁsh doesn’t ﬁt snugly in
the standard model of physics. That
is, accepted physics would predict
that conditions of the early universe
should have destroyed matter, leaving
nothing but a sea of radiation today.

Under the standard model, the
Big Bang should have produced equal
amounts of matter and its counter-
part, antimatter, both of which would
annihilate each other on the spot.

Buta mere apple inthe hand (or on
the head) indicates that the standard
model could use some revision. De-
spite the fact that matter and antimat—
ter armihilatepinphysics experiments,

matter dominates in our universe, so
“something must prefer matter over
anﬁmatter,” Paolone said.

“People think it’s got to do with
neutrinos,” Paolone added.

The particle physics world has ar-
rived at neutrinos after an elimination
process of sorts. The idea is that some
particle must exhibita“charge-parity
violation” —— which would mean the
particle behaves differently than its
antiparticle — big enough to account
for matter’s early victory over anti-
matter.

To date, physicists have not found
a sufﬁciently large CP violation in any
observable particle, discovering only
a small amount in a speciﬁc type of
“quark” — another ﬁindamental
particle. I

“Something had, to have done it.
So the next thing is to go to neutri-
nos,” Paolone said. . ,

But the attention paid to neutri-
nos lies in more than just faith in a
remaining alternative. Rather, “It
turns out that neutrinos oscillate,”

Former SGB members use
experience in careers

Megan Trimble
Stay?’ Writer

Student Government Board election
cycles come and go, Boards transi-
tion and students begin to forget the
faces that represented them, but the
former SGB members don’t forget
— they put their leadership skills to
the test.

After graduating from Pitt, some

students choose to continue school-
ing, others enter politics and some
stumble upon employment oppor-
tunities, but in many cases, their in-

volvements with SGB do not fail to‘

impact their futures.

Sudipta “Nila” Devanath: 2009
and 2010 Board member

Former Board member NilaDeva-
nath completed two years at Pitt’s
School of Medicine before heading
to Harvard Law School, where she is
currently pursuingacombined M.D.
and ].D. with hopes of connecting
doctors and lawyers on national-scale
issues such as health care reform.

Devanath, who was a Board

member for two terms but had been‘

involved with SGB since her fresh-
man year, said that SGB was her
“launching point” because it helped
her cultivate a passion for law and
government.

“My parents are both doctors,
so that’s what I ﬁgured I would do,
but then undergrad went by, and I
was like, ‘Oh crap! I really like this
law and government stuff,”’ she said.
“If it wasn’t for SGB, I wouldn’t be
at Harvard Law. I literally wouldn’t.”

Devanath said that people some-
times view SGB politics as “dirty,” but
after participating in two election cy-
cles as an undergrad, she embraced
the campaigningprocess and learned
to persuade others around her.

“What it didwas make me abetter

advocate for the things that I cared

about. Whatever you care about, you
need to be able to persuade people
and sometimes to represent other
people and argue on their behalf,”
she said;

One of Devanath’s greatest vic-
tories was her work to alter Pitt’s
ﬁnal exam policy, thereby allowing
students to reschedule tests if they
have three or more on the same day.
Devanath said that she was not only
proud of the projects she accom-
plished, but of the people SGB allowed
her to meet. _

“I looked at the other members of
the Board and other student groups
and knew that they were going to be
colleagues of mine some day and the
people that I was going to respect,”
Devanath said.

Charlie Shull: 2009 Board
member and 2010 SGB president

Former SGB President Charlie
Shull now works for Shell Oil where
he is a land representative. In his
work, Shull oversees land contract
acquisitions for Shell’s development
in the Appalachian Basin, meaning
he pressesfor roadway and pipeline
agreements and deals with all activi-
ties concerning the surface. Despite
his current position, Shull hasn’t
ruled out a career in politics.

“I absolutely have a desire to re-
turn to politics because it’s so enjoy-
able to have that notion ofleadership,
responsibility and civil service,” Shull
said.

During his time as president,
Shull was responsible for creating a
more transparent Board by moving
Tuesday meetings from the SGB of-
ﬁce on the eighth ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union to Nordy’sPlace as well as
bringing the Collegiate Readership
Program to Pitt.

Shull added that he only felt suc-

NEUTRINOS

said Howard. “One neutrino, which
classically you’d like to think of as a
point-like particle, is a superposition
of three different mass states.”

He means that neutrinos, as they
travel through space, interconvert
between mass states, which are mix-
tures of mass contributions of three
different “flavors” of neutrinos: the
electron, muon and tau neutrinos.

Scientists hope that if they can
better observe neutrinos’ oscillation
from state to state and from ﬂavor to
ﬂavor, they might discovera sufficient
CP violation in the oscillation process.

“If CP violation doesn’t exist in
neutrinos, then forget it because we
can’t explain it,” Paolone said. “But
it’s expected to be very large with
neutrinos.”

Zeroing in on neutrinos

Only experiments will tell if neu-
trino oscillation exhibits CP violation,
and if so, by how much. Howard, Car-
roll and Elharake understand this.

“Because we’re experimentalists,
we want to test it,” Carroll said.

However, testing it directly will
require brain and capital resources
far beyond the capacities of any indi-
vidual laboratory such as Paolone’s.
Particle physics sets itselfapart from

other ﬁelds in that asking an experi-

mental question typically means a lot
of money and collaboration between
many scientists and universities: The

well—known Large Hadron Collider g

involved thousands of professors.

Finding answers to the next big
questions regarding neutrino behav-
iorwill take a similarly collaborative
route when a large, multi—location
particle detector begins studying
neutrinos at the European Center for
Nuclear Research in Geneva in 2014.

Paolone’s students have grabbed
on to a piece of that puzzle: They’re
running simulations of the CERN de-
tector with hopes of enhancing its
detection capacity but, interestingly,
not of neutrinos.

“The experiments thatwe’re a part
ofwant to observe these neutrino os-
cillations from a man-made beam of
neutrinos,” Carroll said. ‘We’re trying
to understand the beginning [of that
beam],” he said.

But physicists can’t produce neu-
trinos out of thin air. They ﬁrst have
to produce — you guessed it — a dif-
ferent class of particles.

Enter the “hadrons.” The CERN
detector, which replicates a detec-
tor at Fermilab near Chicago, is re-
ally three parts: a particle smasher,
magnets to aim the resulting particles
and detectors to monitorwhat’s hap-
pened.

Even if you are not 100 percent sure of
path, it’s best to declare a major early

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

There are quite a few times when
I ﬁnd myself reflecting on the
“coulds” and “should haves” _of
my now-completed undergradu-
ate career. Recently, I’ve been
thinking about; the;_ear;ly dec '
sions I made _in my ‘college career?
that have made the‘lrni_)stvp‘ositive‘
ripples for years of su-ccessiat:

my years at college and more
productive learning.

This sounds obvious, but I
feel it’s quickly and::easily'l,over—

‘looked. At Pitt andmany other

universities,  students

begin their undergraduate.. pro-
grams and academicjournéys not ' '

knowing what ﬁeld to pursue.
These choices are often rein-
forced by universities that allow
students to remain undeclared
well into their second year of
college. , ~
However, this decision delay

"to ﬁnd on-campus clubs, -local if

is not necessarily the best way to
start an academic career.

One of the most obvious ben-
efits of deciding a major early
is that it allows the student to
complete major requirements
from the start. Most universi-
ties are quite costly per credit
— Pitt in-state cost per credit
is $655 — so it’s advantageous
to be able to calculate precisely
how many classes are required
to fulﬁll your major. Even though
many students’ ﬁrst years will be
spent taking general education
courses, students usually have
room to squeeze in a few major-
required ones, if they choose to
start taking them early.

Choosing early alsolhelps
when building connections to
ﬁnd a better career. Let’s say you
declare your major as a fresh-
man. You’ll have several years

groups and national organiza-
tions geared toward-your major

._ or intended career ‘path. These —
organizations might host career’ ‘

fairs, conferences or workshops
that are designed to help you
make professional connections.
Such events can lead to valuable
internships or entry-level posi-
tions, which can lead to better
job opportunities in the future.

. «neithe

Giving yourself several years
—— rather than several furied
months — to pursue these con-
nections can result in less stress
and better results.

In addition, deciding a major
early can provide students with
the potential to graduate early.
Some majors at Pitt have relative-
ly few core courses. Completing
these early on can allow students
to have more ﬂexibility in their
schedules later.

However, you may be hesitant
because you don’t know what
you want to do. Many students
change their major, often mul-
tiple times. You don’t want to
play hopscotch for three years.

This would be a problem if a
major created a deﬁned career
path. But by declaring a new ma-
jor, you are not locking yourself
into a deﬁnite career choice. You
are merely..specifying‘-ageneral

IMPULSE

Graﬂiti art make public statement across Pittsburgh and abroad

Artists riskﬁeedom to gain status in gmﬁiti community

  

Surrounded by rough sketches of his
own work that are taped to nearly every
wall of the room, the artist sits on the ﬂoor.
His skinny frame is clothed injordan-brand
shoes and sweatpants, a streetwear—brand
T—shirt covering his upper body as he pre-
pares to divulge information about his
career.

Asking to keep his real name private
due to the law’s regulations on graffiti, the
Pittsburgh graffiti artist referred to him-
self as KAMS, a namewhich can be seen in
many locations across the Steel City — if
you know where to look — in the form of
bright colors and bubble letters, though he
doesn’t limit himself to a particular style
of graffiti.

Before developing a signature style,
KAMS ﬁrst built upon his love of art when
he was young, slowly discovering his skill
set.

“I was about 12 or 13. I was into art, I
was into drawing things. I started writing
names, started getting good at it,” he said
of the craft he has practiced for almost a
decade. “When you start writing names, you
start thinking of different ways to write it
and you go from there. It progresses. Then
you start actually going out at night, and
the more you stay on it, the more you get
up,” KAMS said.

Another grafﬁti artist,James, a 20-year-
old Pitt junior maintaining his anonymity
for reasons similar to KAMS’, also got his
start when he was in middle school.

“We were trying to be stereotypical,
no-good kids. We all liked punk~music and
hip -hop and doing stupid things; so We de-
cided we’d try it,” saidjames, whose group
of friends were inducted into the subculture
by a friend’s older brother who had already
taken up the hobby. Much like KAMS,]ames

also lacks a speciﬁc style, dabbling in vari- .

ous forms of graffiti.

“We knew the stigma associated with it
and we thought it was cool,” he said.

For better or worse, the stigma associ-
ated with graffiti is often negative.

“We knew that it was one of the pillars
of hip-hop. And even before that, it’s never
been legal, so it’s something that only ‘cool
kids’ could do,” James said.

Some circles have exchanged the word

“cool” with “vandal,” as police have in-
creased interest in the art—centric hobby
of people like James.

“The vandalism of our neighborhoods
will not be ignored,” Mayor Luke Ravens-
tahl said at a press conference on Feb. 2,
2007. “A Police Graffiti Task Force has been
created to focus on this city-wide problem.”

For the past six years, the three—man
Pittsburgh Police Grafliti Task Force has
led the charge in Pittsburgh’s crackdown
on graffiti across the city. Detective Frank
Rende, one of the task force’s members, has
helped to bring down some of Pittsburgh’s
most signiﬁcant graffiti artists.

“There is no graﬂiti allowed in the city,
at all,” Rende said.

The Pittsburgh Police Graffiti Task
Force follows the Pennsylvania Crimes
Code, charging each convicted grafﬁti art-
ist with criminal mischief. Section 3304,
Subsection a4 of the crimes code prescribes
this charge to those who are convictedof
“intentionally [defacing] or otherwise
[damaging] tangible public property or
tangible property of another with graf-
ﬁti by use of any aerosol spray paint can,
broad—tipped indelible marker or similar
marking device.”

Each individual case is then further as-
sessed based on the cost of damage. Work-
ing with the City of Pittsburgh Public Works
Department, the task force charges $300
for the ﬁrst square foot of damage and $50
for each additional square foot.

But the process to assess the damage
isn’t that simple. The cost of removing
the graffiti from certain types of material
(more for natural stone, less for a painted
surface), along with the height of the graf-
ﬁti can increase removal costs. Only after
it evaluates the scene does the task force
add up the cost of damages.

According to the Pennsylvania Crimes
Code, damage estimated at less than
$150 warrants a summary charge; $150
to $1,000 worth of damage qualiﬁes as a
misdemeanor of the third degree; $1,000
to $5,000 is charged as a misdemeanor
of the second degree; $5,000 or more in
damages falls under the charge of a third-

FILM REVIEW

‘BD2’ wraps up franchise
with blood-filled finale

Quinn Keaney
Staff Wrz'ter

“Breaking Dawn -- Part 2”
Directed by: Bill Condon

Starring: Kristen Stewart,
Robert Pattinson, Taylor
Lautner

Grade: B-

It’s clear from the opening scene of “Breaking
Dawn — Part 2” that when Bella Swan, played
by a surprisingly less-lifeless Kristen Stewart,
blinks those blood—red, baby vampire eyes,
Stephenie Meyer’s “Twilight” saga has come a
long way from its “hold on tight, spider mon-
key,” days. The series has ﬁnally hit its stride
with “BD2.” It’s a shame really, since Twilight-
hating used to be so easy.

This addition to the series ﬁnally lets its
hair down and doesn’t take itself too seri-
ously. Unlike its predecessors, the kid gloves
are off and this time, it’s for the best. Director
Bill Condon, who led the ridiculously goofy
“Breaking Dawn ~— Part 1,” has ﬁnally discov-
ered a way to tell the “Twilight” story that is
appealing to Twihards but doesn’t totally iso-

late non—fans. With the help of Melissa Rosen— '

berg, the screenwriter who’s been a part of the
story since day one of the ﬁlm series, this for-
mula manages to be a relative success.

. The ﬁfth and ﬁnal ﬁlm devotes nearly
all of its 115 minutes to quenching the vora-
cious thirst of its legion of dedicated fans for
all things Bella, Edward and Jacob. There’s
still plenty of rock—solid lupine abs, courtesy
of Taylor Lautner (expect a chorus of fan—gir1
screaming), and sizzling vamp—on—vamp ro-
mance. This time around, newly-minted vam-
pire Bella (Kristen Stewart) is able to let out
the ferocious, bed—breaking loving she’s been
forced to hold back since day one with Edward
Cullen (Robert Pattinson) — every teenager’s
sparkly, undead wet dream.

Bella struts her stuff, embraces her new-
found powers, and ditches the irritating lip
biting and mumbling to become the heroine
Meyer was never quite able to bring to term.
It’s also nice to see her saving Edward on mul-
tiple occasions throughout the ﬁlm, which
prompts him to give her a much—needed and
thankful apology for underestimating her all
of these years. There’s no apology for being a
suffocating, controlling, autonomy-robbing
creep in the past, but we’ll just have to take
what we can get. V

Bella isn’t the only one with new powers,
though. Her and Edward’s half-human-half-
vampire daughter, Renesmee (Mackenzie
FOY). has a few special talents of her own.
These talents include aging from a creepy,
CGI newbom to a well-behaved 6-year-old

Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson

film. MCT Campus

girl within the span of a few days. Some of the
ﬁlm’s most tender moments feature Bell a’s in-
teractions with her daughter.

Renesmee soon captures the unwanted
attention of the Volturi — the high—powered,
vicious oligarchs in charge of all vampire af-
fairs — led by the all-knowing Aro (Michael
Sheen). Renesmee is thought to be an unethi-
cally created “immortal child” —- a vampire
no-no — and the Volturi set off to destroy her.

The Cullens’ coven combs the globe for
friends and family to act as witnesses to the
fact that Renesmee is not what the Volturi as-
sume and to stand by them. While this part of
the plot sags, it still manages to be entertain-
ing — thanks to Sheen’s ridiculously campy
performance —— breathing life into the screen
with his overly-dramatic, wide-eyed facial ex-
pressions and kitschy giggle.

This tension ﬁnally results in a suspense-
ful showdown between Team Cullen and
Team Volturi. Although it features some of the
worst CGI seen to date (why a billion—dollar
franchise can’t afford to use decent special ef-
fects, I’ll_ never know), the scene is tense and
well-paced and concludes with a satisfying
twist that strays from the book in the best way
possible.

Despite all of this, “Breaking Dawn —— Part
2” is still a pretty awful ﬁlm. It’s cluttered with
useless characters and ﬁlled with laughable
acting, poor dialogue and a slew of afore-
mentioned CGI disasters. But then again,
this is what makes “Twiligh ” what it is, and
the pulpy, over-the-top vampire love fest just
wouldn’t be as good if it weren’t so bad. I

This sugar madness only we e as,

the colder months approach. Around the
holidays — often courtesy of our generous
and loving patients — our ofﬁce receives
more than enough sweet treats, which are
neatly placed and later devoured in the
back of the office. Halloween left us with

it is also just bad for my fading summer mo-
tivation to get in shape. The ofﬁce, the caf-
eteria and your mom’s sweet—ﬁlled kitchen
can all turn into danger zones during the
holidays. What can we do to battle these
sweet temptations‘; Here are a few tricks to
keep you ﬁghting back thosesugar cravings
this winter.

Bring water

' Whether you are surrounded by sweets
during the day or your sweet tooth is crying
out for some sort of chocolate goodness,
water can help. Sometimes you can feel
hungry based on your hydration levels. Be-
fore you take another bite of that chocolate
cake, take a few sips of water and wait.

- Dehydration also causes you to choose
junk foods over healthy foods. When your
body is properly hydrated, it works as it
should. When you are fully functioning,
you are better able to make good food deci-
sions, including choosing a good meal over
a plate ﬁill of cookies and calling it dinner.

Water is the best drink for you. Literally
half of our body weight is made up of water.

It not only helps to ﬁght these holiday sugar

cravings, but it also helps reduce muscle fa-
tigue, regulate digestion and keep your skin
looking clear and moisturized.

Exercise daily

Another way to escape sugar cravings is
to run away from them. Exercise helps to
keep our crazy sugar appetites quiet. Ex-
ercising helps you feel more conﬁdent and
stronger, and the exertions you make will
leave your body wanting real food.

If you are not motivated to get out and
run, take it slow. Start where your body is
comfortable. Whether that means walking’
for 20 minutes three times a week or begin-
ning a triathlon workout plan, start some-

where and set goals. Taking charge of your a

body by incorporating an exercise routine

into your week will make you feel more in _

control of what goes into your body. Leav-
ing that tray full of cookies in the back of-
ﬁce will feel like a victory, not a depravity.

Fill up on the good stuffﬁrst

Fill up on healthy food ﬁrst. Eat your
dinner before dessert. When your parents
make a “welcome home” dessert for you
to eat, make sureto have a portion of each
healthy food —- protein, fat and vegetable
-— before you dive into the chocolate cake.
If you ﬁll up on the good stuff, you will be
less inclined to overdo it on the desserts.

Now I don’t want to advocate saying no
to all treats. The best way to live a healthy
lifestyle is to enjoy little bits of treats. Al-
though there is a tendency to over-con-
sume during the holiday season, you don’t
have to engage in the behavior. You can en-
joy desserts and big, festive meals. The key
is to stay in charge and make smart choices.

Eat a piece of deliciousness, but remem-
ber to maintain your smart choices, too.
And remember, brush your teeth when

you’re done. I

for his house and the old grafﬁti matched
the new grafﬁti, so we arrested him and
took him back to jail,” a member of the
Pittsburgh Police Graﬂiti Task Force said,
speaking on Mr. Montano’s large case ﬁle,
which consists of 89 counts of guilty pleas
to the charge of criminal mischief and
damage to over 125 locations at the cost
of roughly $713,800. A

Now, after being charged with robbery
and simple assault this past August, the
26-year-old grafﬁti artist is back behind
bars.

“Mr. Montano was an artist, there’s no
doubt about it, but he used his talents for
evil instead of good,” Rende said.
Montano might not have been able to

  

escape the law, but other graffiti artists
-have received acclaim —— turning an illegal
hobby into a profession. _ ,

Banksy, a British grafﬁti artist who has
covered walls across the globe, has reached
such a high level of fame that not only are
celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Angelina
Jolie owners of a Banksy original, but seri-
ous art collectors have also caught Banksy
fever, leading to two of his pieces selling
for more than $1 million.

As budding Pittsburgh graﬂiti artists
such as KAMS andjames continue to oper-
ate under cover of darkness for fear of the
police, 42-year-old Shepard Fairey (a.k.a.
Obey) and other celebrity “street artists”
are able to freely move from city to city,
leaving their marks’ for all to see — even
here in Pittsburgh, which received a visit
from Fairey this past summer. Fairey has
turned his work into the popular Obey
streetwear clothing brand, a brand that
donates its proﬁts to various charities,
including Hope for Darfur, the 11th Hour
Project and Feeding America, giving back
to the community that helped catapult him
to fame.“Banksy and Obey, I’m not a big fan.
I do like their art. I don’t like the fact that
they’ll buff everything around them, but
leave that just because it’s titled as street
art, not graffiti,” KAMS said, referencing
two of grafﬁti’s biggest superstars.

As street artists like Banksy and Obey
reap the beneﬁts of acclaim, the work of
other, lesser-known‘ artists gets erased,
not deemed worthy enough to remain on
the wall like the art of their celebrity coun-
terparts. »

“You put your blood, sweat and tears into
it,” KAMS said. “I’m sure they’ve been there,
but how do you justify leaving’ their stuff
up? Sure, there are kids running around
putting up stuff that doesn’t look so great,
but that’s where you start from,” he says,
lamenting the fact that Pittsburgh has yet
to install “free walls” —— walls designated
by cities speciﬁcally for grafﬁti that can be
found in more than 100 cities nationwide.

“Growing up, I was always taught you
don’t write on schools, you don’t write on
businesses, you don’t write on people’s
houses,” KAMS said, explaining the rules
that encompass what some perceive as a

. lawless free-for-all subculture. But not ev-

eryone who practices grafﬁti abides by the
same set of rules KAMS does, part of the
reason the negative stigma has come to
hang over the art form.

“It’s forbidden in the city, there is no
safe place to tag,” Rende said, reinforcing
the harsh tone that Pittsburgh has taken

’ toward those interested in graﬂiti — one
that has led to numerous arrests in recent .

years.

“The aspect of taking letters and twist-"
ing them in different ways; it’s all art. There
are people that do characters, giant murals;
it’s all art. From the littlest piece to the giant
tags,” KAMS said.

It seems as if the debate will not be end-
ing anytime soon, as new artists continue
to dodge police and cover walls around
the globe. I F

WRESTLING

Slow start against Ohio State drops Panthers to 0-2

Dustin Gabler '
Senior Stcyf Wrz'ter

For the second straight match in a row, the Pitt
wrestling team’s lower weight classes struggled
and a solid performance by the higher weight
classes wasn’t enough to earn the win.

The Panthers now sit at 0-2 after dropping
Sunday’s matchup with No. 5 Ohio State, 26-13.

Having made it to three Eastern Wrestling
League championships in the past three years,
Pitt has had plenty of regular-season success,
but it wants to convert that success into an
NCAA tournament appearance in March. By
taking on top competition, as the Panthers have
done in their ﬁrst two contests against Michi-
gan and Ohio State, Pitt is hoping to change its
postseason fortune.

“[Tough matches] help us know where we’re
at and give us an idea of what we need to do to
complete our goals,” junior Shelton Mack said.
“Having a tough schedule prepares you for a
tournament, because you’re going to wrestle
one tough opponent after another.”

The Buckeyes swept the ﬁrst ﬁve matches of
the meet on Sunday with two pins, two major
decisions and one minor decision.

‘ Not wasting any time, Ohio State jumped
out to a 12-0 lead by recording pins — worth
six team points — at the 125- and 133-pound
weight classes. Freshman Godwin Nyamawas
pinned by Ohio State’s No. 8 N ikko Triggas, and
No. 7 Mack was pinned by No. 1 Logan Stieber.

The next two matches were better for the
Panthers — but only slightly. At the’141- and
149-pound weight classes, Pitt’s wrestlers
avoided getting pinned but still suffered major-
decision losses — losing by between 8 and 14
points -— giving the Buckeyes four team points

SPORTS

for each loss.

Ohio State’s No. 4 Hunter Stieber defeated
Panther Travis Shaffer 10-2 at 141 pounds, and
Pitt’s 149—pounder, Donnie Tasser, fell 11-3 to
No. 7 Cam Tessari as the Buckeyes took a com-
manding 20-0 lead.

One of the night’s most exciting matches
came when Pitt 157-pound sophomore Troy
Reaghard wrestled toe-to-toe with No. 16Josh
Demas. The two both recorded-an escape -
Reaghard inthe second period and Demas inthe
third --. and were tied at one with time running
out. Demas connected for atwo—point takedown
with one second remainingin the match to win.

The Panthers, with several youngwrestlers
such as Reaghard and Nyama, are beingforced
to learn quickly, as Pitt’s schedule doesn’t have
any guaranteed wins early in the season.

“These tough matches are to get the guys
that don’t have any experience an idea of what
college wrestling is all about,” senior Zac Tho-
musseit said. “I took my lumps as a younger guy,
but you have to learn fast and keep moving on.”

With Demas’ win, Pitt entered the second
half of the match with a 23-0 deﬁcit.

No. 16 Tyler Wilps got the Panthers on the
scoreboard with his 5-1 win over Ohio State’s
Mark Martin at 165 pounds.

At 174 pounds, the Buckeyes’ No. 2 Nick He-
ﬂin failed to overpower Pitt’s Nick Bonaccorsi.
The match ended 3-3 before the deciding point
was given to Heﬂin for his 1:07 of riding time
— awarded when a wrestler has his opponent
held down on the mat for more than one minute
-— giving Ohio State the 4-3 win.

With the score now 26-3, Heflin’s win guar-
anteed that Pitt would lose the team match.

But with three of its four best-ranked wres-
tlers at the four highest weight classes, Pittwas
lookingto pick up points and narrow the deﬁcit.

No. 14 Max Thomusseit won a tight match
3-2 over Ohio State’s Kenny Curtis, who was
looking to notchanupset victory. '

Pitt got its own major decision when its best
wrestler, N o. 2 Matt Wilps, defeated CJ. Magrum
13-3 at the 197-pound weight class. Although the
team match was out of reach, Wilps ignored the
Ohio State momentum to take care ofbusiness.

I “When the team is down, I ﬁnd it best to
just focus on my own match and ignore the
momentum,” Wilps said. ,

In only the second match of the day featur-
ing two ranked wrestlers, the Panthers came up

with thewin. No. 8 heavyweight Zac Thomusseit
defeated No. 19 Peter Capone 5-1 to bring the
ﬁnal score to 26-13.

Now sitting at 0-2, the Panthers come to

Pittsburgh for their ﬁrst home match of the
season when they host ﬁiture ACC foe Virginia
Tech. The Hokies, ranked 12th nationally, will
also challenge the Panthers at many weight
classes.

“It really sucks being 0-2,” Zac Thomusseit
said. “We have to keep our eyes on the prize,
which is March. All these tough matches are
preparation for the national tournament.” I

BARNES BURNER

Robinson, Moore, Taylor led Pitt’s incredible comeback victory

Nate Barnes
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Roughly two days after the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team overcame an 18-point deﬁcit
to defeat the Oakland Golden Grizzlies in
overtime Saturday, I ﬁnd myself just as lost
and mystiﬁed by the game’s proceedings as
I was on Saturday night.

Down 34-20 at the half, Pitt battled back
early in the second half, cutting the Oak-
land lead to 12 points with 14:33 remaining
in the game after Trey Zeigler made a free
throw. But, as it did for roughly 37 minutes
of Saturday’s contest, Oakland answered
the Panthers and pushed the lead back up
to its highest point of the evening at 48-30.

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon, who looked
certiﬁably and justiﬁably steamed at halftime

as he walked from the locker room back
out to the ﬂoor, maintained conﬁdence in
the Panthers the entire time. At a media
timeout with 11:34 remaining on the clock,
Dixon held fast to his conﬁdence in his team’s
ability to win the game.

“I told the guys there’s going to be about
15 possessions for each team the rest of the
way,” Dixon said after the game. “That’s
plenty of possessions to get stops, plenty
of possessions to score baskets.”

Dixon also maintained his belief that the
Panthers would eventually ﬁnd their rhythm,
while the Grizzlies would cool off.

“I ﬁgured we couldn’t be as bad as we were
in the ﬁrst half, and they couldn’t be as good
as they were in the ﬁrst six, seven minutes.”

Amazingly, Dixon’s thoughts became re-
ality as the Panthers stormed back to force

overtime, where they earned a 72-62 victory.

How and why did this memorable come-
back happen, you ask? Look no further than
James Robinson, Dante Taylor and].J. Moore.

Robinson

In the ﬁnal minutes of regulation, Rob-
inson showed moxie unseen at Pitt since the
days when Levance Fields ran the ‘point. With
15 seconds left, thefreshman point guard
waved off a screen from Taylor and drove to
the basket. Although Robinson traveled, he
made up for it on the next play by stealing
the ball and drawing a foul.

Trailing 58-56 with 10 seconds on the
clock, he calmly stepped to the line and
knocked down both free throws to tie the
game.

V “I ﬁgured I could make up for my travel

by making a play on the defensive end,” Rob-
inson said after his 14-point performance.

If you didn’t know before, you do now: *3
James Robinson is a winner. It’s no won- ‘

der the kid won 120 games in four years
at DeMatha Catholic High School; he does
not lose.

“He’s a tremendous player. There’s a rea-
son we got him out there starting,” Dixon

said about Robinson. “He has maturity?

that is beyond his years, both physically
and mentally.”

in the crowd at the Petersen Events Center ..

nation of Pitt, Moore took his intensity to
another level.

Both offensively and defensively, Moore
outperformed nearly every player on the
ﬂoor, as reﬂected by his 16 points and 10
rebounds off the bench.

Repeatedly, Moore beat his chest,
pumped his ﬁsts, ﬂexed his muscles and
even pulled out a Cam Newton—esque Super-
man celebration after one of the many tough
plays he made.

Pitt’s incredible rally would not have hap-
pened without_].J. Moore’s inﬂuence.

Taylor

One of Pitt’s much-criticized players dur-
ing his tenure here, Taylor took a huge stride
towards redemption with his performance
against Oakland. Off the bench, Dante ﬁn-
ished with 12 points and nine rebounds.

Of those nine boards, seven were huge
offensive rebounds that led to put—backs on
his end or continued offensive opportunities
for the Panthers, who needed every possible

shot they could get when Oakland had them
on the ropes.

“There are the people who focus on what
he can’t do. Thepeople who focus on what
he cando see what a great kid he is,” Dixon
said about Taylor after the game.

The fans saw not only a great kid, but a
great kid putting on a great performance,
which his teammates built off. And it will
certainly give Pitt fans more conﬁdence
knowing that when freshman center Steven
Adams struggles as he did against Oakland,
with Taylor in reserve, the Panthers aren’t
doomed.

But as much as the individual perfor-
mances helped Pitt overcorne one of its
largest deﬁcits in the program’s history,
the team’s total effort kept the Panthers
undefeated.

It was redshirt senior point guard Tray
Woodall who put it best after the game.

“We didn’t shoot well, we didn’t defend
well,” Woodall said. “One thing we did do
was ﬁght. Basically, we just fought.” |
