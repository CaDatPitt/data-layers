SGB Election Controversies Winding   Down to Resolutions‘

_ The controversies surrounding
the 1979 Student Government
Board election are slowly winding
down to resolution, ' with two
decisions being handed down by
the SGB Judiciary and Elections
Committees on Friday.

_ The _SGB Judiciary threw’ out a
case involving charges brought by’
board. candidates Peter Germain,
Pete Daloni and ‘Adan Mele that the

Engineering’ ‘Student Cabinet vio- _

lated the SGB ‘election-code_.‘— , ,
According to the candidates; the
cabinet offered a $100 prize to the

._ engineering,-department with the

greatest participation in last week's
election. I , . -

The controversy stemmed from
an article published‘ in GIBBS
News. a newsletter distributed in
the department of chemical engin-

eering.

“This (getting the engineering “

students out to vote) is, important
because we want the people in SGB
to be willing to work for us. So
keep in mind the Engineering
Student Cabinet sponsored candi-
dates when you vote, ” according to
the article.

The possibility of any wrong-
doing was cited under Article VI
Section 2 of the Election Code that

_- deals ‘with bribes, deﬁning a bribe
as something that serves to induce

or inﬂuence. ‘

The _charges were originally
dealt‘ with_ before the SGB
elections committee but v some
procedural errors were observed by
Steve Fendler, chairman of the

SGB ‘ Judiciary.

According to Fendler. the
elections committee has the power
to act on -alleged violations of the
code within 24 hours of the
incident. Fendler said members of
the elections committee believed
action must be taken within 24
hours -of the knowledge of the
incident.

Because of the procedural
inaccuracies, the judicial , board
could not “proceed to pass judgment
on the alleged infringements by the
Engineering Cabinet. '

The elections committee ‘also:
‘ruled not to ‘disqualify ‘board
‘member elect Walter Burke.

Burke overspent the $50 limit
alloted board candidates for cam-
paign materials by’ spending
$50.04.

The SGB Elections Committee (chaired by Mark Suekolf, pictured above) voted
not to disqualify board member-elect Walter Burke who overspent his
campaign budget limit by four cents.

Pennsylvana Hostage To Be Released By Iranan Students.

Katherine Gross left this north-
western Pennsylvania farming
community only a few weeks ago on
a long-awaited adventure as a
foreign service secretary in Iran.

“I’d hate to say how many calls
we’ve had today. But we want to
hear Kathy call us,” said her
father, Robert Gross.

“We feel pretty strong that we
may hear from her yet today.”

. The family’s hopes ‘soared
Sunday when Iranian students

But that good news proved to be

Questions
For Jimmy

Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenini’s order of the
release of the women and blacks among the 62
American hostages being held in Tehran brings a ray
of hope to the two week long standoff between the
United States and Iran. Hopefully, this move could
lead to negotiations over the freeing of the rest of the
hostages, and an end to both international tensions
and to confrontations between Americans and
Iranians in the United States. If the hostage issue is
resolved by the two nations, President Jimmy Carter
still must answer one question. Why did he allow the
desposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to enter the
United States, knowing that this probably would lead
to an attack against the U.S. embassy in Tehran.

It is very clear Carter and other top members of the
administration knew the consequences of admitting
the Shah into the United States. Reportedly, Carter
even asked during one staff meeing on the issue,
“When the Iranians take our people in Tehran
hostage, what will you advise me then?” To try to
mitigate the effects of admitting the Shah, L. Bruce

Laingen, the acting ambassador in Tehran, was
instructed to warn secretly the then Prime Minister
Mehdi Bazargan and Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi
of the planned move.

The decision to admit the Shah despite this

knowledge appears to have been the final surrender ,

to friends of the former Iranian dictator after eight
months of lobbying from s_uch influential Americans
as David Rockefeller, who is also the Shah’s banker,
and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
who still packs much clout in Washington.

Kissinger volunteered to use his influence in
Washington in order to gain the Shah’s entrance into
the United States. First, information was leaked by
sources close to Kissinger that the Carter
administration was blocking the admittance of the
Shah. Then, the former Secretary of State convinced
the British to use their influence to obtain for the
Shah a temporary visavtfor the Bahamas, and also met
with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in April to ask
that the disposed king be allowed to enter this
country. Carter stalled for time, sending a message
to Kissinger that said the time was not right for
admittingthe Shah.

Rockefeller, the chairman of Chase Manhatten
Bank, gave the Shah help through a close personal
aid, Joseph V. Reed. Reed visited several foreign
countries would he made inquiries for the Shah and
voiced Rockefeller’s interest in the Shah’s case to
David D. Newsom, the State Department’s
Undersecretary for Political Affairs. This office was
the main one that handled the Shah’s case.. ,

The news that gave these friends of the Shah the

Page 4—Monday, November 19, 1979 A?

leverage needed to win entry for him was the
discovery that the former Iranian ruler suffered from
cancer. When Dr. Benjamin Kean, a prominent
specialist on tropical diseases, visited the Shah and
reported that he needed special treatment in the
United States, the administration finally gaveinto
pressure to admit the Shah. In mid-October the
president’s senior foreign policy advisers met and
therewas no opposition to admitting the Shah.
Vance asserted that the deposed king had togwbe
allowed to enter the country on humanitarian
grounds and decided to warn the Iranians in advanc ,
to get assurances of the ‘safety of the Tehran
embassy.

’   The results of the admission of the Shah are now

history. As the American Embassy and the CIA had
warned, the Shah’s entrance into the United States
led to fervent anti-Americanism in Iran and an attack
on the embassy. Unfortunately, the incident also
toppled Foreign Minister Yazdi, who had helped end
a seizure of the embassy in February, and the

‘ incident escalated into an international crisis.

Rockefeller’s and Kissinger’s inordinate impact on
the administration decisions about the Shah should
be investigated further. When two men can push the‘
U.S. government to make a decision that obviously
would lead to the endangerment of U.S. personnel in
the Tehran embassy, the system definitely has gone
awry. Congress should investigate this matter fully
when the hostages have been released. Perhaps such
an inquiry cannot alleviate the suffering of the 62
Americans in the embassy and their families, but it
can help to stop such carelessness in the future.

One needn't look to Washington,
Harrisburg ‘or even the City County

‘Building for examples of inefﬁc-

ient, unresponsive. and entrenched
bureaucracy. It should surprise
few at Pitt that at least one such
organization exists in our own little
part of Oakland. I have in mind the
Graduate and Professional Student

A Association (GPSA).
 I       
 si'ona;l*stud_ents. ‘But they an have
their pockets picked regularly to.

keep this sluggist creature alive.
(Perhaps alive is an exaggeration).

The GPSA is supposed to
represent graduate and profession-

al student's views and problems to

the administration, to provide
services to students and to allocate
student activity fees. It does none

of these well, or even satisfactory. ‘

, Although there are vague claims
that GPSA has actually sought to
help an occasional graduate stu-
dent with an administrative prob-
lem, it is difficult to see how an

organization with so little input
from its constituents can claim to
represent anyone.

Recent meetings of the student
board which supposedly governs
GPSA have been held without
notice to representatives. The
most recent meeting of the group
was presided over by an adminis-
trative assistant, rather than the
student President. Absenteeism is
:_re_p’oe,teﬂy,high at these meetings

  to determine —
.-  since no one. including

the -group's administrative assis.
tam. seems to be sure who the
GPSA representatives are, or even
which graduate schools are active
participants.

For the money taken by GPSA,
students get the above mentioned
administrative assistant. complete
with secretary and copy machines.
They also are privileged to make
copies at four cents a piece. This is
a full one cent less than anywhere
else at the University. These are
the entire services provided by the
GPSA.

. After years of consideration. and

promises and plans for improve-
ment; and consultations with
GPSA’s administrative assistant
and‘ Director of Student Affairs,
Andy Smith; the Student Bar
Association (SBA), the student
government at the Law School,
have voted to seek withdrawal from
GPSA and have law student
activity fees allocated directly to
the Law School.

We believe thatiﬂiiis  a, wise

action for the law school and for
every other school which sees its
student monies taken with very
little received in return. However,
the SBA can, only speak for the

“students it represents. It can only

point out the logic of the situation
to other schools.

That logic is that the portion of
student activity fees going to GPSA
could be better spent by individual
student governing groups with
each school. This would be true
because there would be no need to
pay the salary of an administrative
assistant or secretary. Also. each
school could provide services that

meet the special needs of its
students.

For instance we do not believe
that the most important need of law
students is cheaper copying. But: if
we did, the SBA’could use the
money currently going to ,GPSA
subsidizing 53,000 copies a year
down to the four cent level.‘ That
represents 80 copies for. every
student at the Law School.

'I’vh'e'i-ei_di;tyis  "a, small ,

percentage of law students-_use -the
copy center and even "fewer make
as many as 80.copies a year there.

Other graduateand professional
students at Pitt could beneﬁt from
having their activity "fees bypass
the high overhead GPSA‘ and go
directly to their schools. This is not
an untried or unproven idea.
According to Mr. Smith, it is the
manner in which most universities
allocate graduate student activity
fees.

Naturally the SBA proposals
have aroused opposition in those
with a vested interest in GPSA’s
survival and continued consump-

  

tion of student monies. A lobbying
campaign has been waged by
GPSA’s administrative assistant.
He recently sent a letter around
warning of the ‘,‘repercussions” of
the SBA actions, and urging
member organization presidents to

“contact me personally” about thisisi‘

“unpr_ecendented” and “not quite
easily done” action.

PanthersForce Army

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

WEST POINT, N.Y.—The Pitt
Panthers assured themselves a
spot in the Fiesta Bowl on
Christmas Day by walloping Army
40-0 Saturday in Pitt’s most
complete display of offensive and
defensive football this season. The
Cadets simply did not belong on
the same ﬁeld with the Panthers,
and so futile were their efforts that
they failed to cross the 50-yard line
until late in the third quarter.

Dan Marino threw the ball at
will, completing 17 of 30 passes for
272 yards and a touchdown, while
the running backs and receivers
took turns scooting past, through
and around the painfully slow
Army defense.

The game was over after Pitt’s
ﬁrst possession, when Marino took
the Cats 68 yards on 12 plays,
culminating with a 2-yard TD run
by Rooster Jones. Highlighting the
drive were three Marino comple-
tions for 29 yards, and a 16-yard
run on a draw play by Wayne
DiBartola.

The next time Pitt got the ball
was on the Army 35, and on the
first play, Marino hit Jones on a
screen pass, and the Rooster did a
good job cutting across the grain to
get all the way down to the Army 2,
from where he scored two plays,
-making the score 12-0. Mark
Schubert was wide to the right on
his first extra _point conversion, and.
when Pitt ‘went for two points the
second time, Marino’s pass was
wrestled away from Jones by
Army’s Dale Love.

Once again, Pitt’s defense held
the Cadets on downs, and Pitt
took over at the Army 45.

Marino hit Kenny Bowles for 22

yards, and Ralph Still for 10, before
-misfiring on his next three

attempts. Schubert was sum-
moned into the game,
connected on a 27-yard ﬁeld goal,
making _the score 15-0.

Ricky Jackson. Mulrane must still

backup Jerryl '-‘iennett.

ing four passes, for 21, 23, 12 and

Pantherettes Take Top Honors in East by Spikinge Georgetown

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staffwriter

To the spectators watching Pitt
play Georgetown Saturday, it
looked as if the Pantherette volley-
ball team -had already won the
eastern title by defeating Rutgers
in the semiﬁnals.

The Hoyas ' came out looking
slow, tired and sluggish. Besides,
in pool play, the Pantherettes had
little trouble with them.

But, something happened in the
third game of the best three out ‘of
five match which lit a spark in the
collective mind of the Georgetown
players. After that point, the
Pantherettes had to fight and claw

_for every 4 point, as Georgetown
’ . m1ade'»it clear that it was  to be .

i ‘ a'o".eake-walk for Pitt.

  

* ‘“Georg'etown'ne_ver ﬁnished" that ‘ ‘

high bef_ore‘and i think they just all
of a sudden realized they were in a
championship match,” said coach"
Mike Hebert.‘ “Inthe beginning,
we intimidated them, but after
Maria Perez went out with a slight
ankle injury we had to make a
couple of adjustments and broke
down 'a bit. It gave them a lot of
heart and they realized they could
play with us.”

In getting to the ﬁnals. the
Pantherettes’ won four matches and
lost one. In pool play, Pitt defeated
Rhode “Island 15-9,_ 15-7. lost to

Penn State_15—12.  11-15, and

beat Georgetown 15-7, 15-11.

In the first round of the playoffs,
Pitt downed George Washington
15-13, 15-7. This advanced the
Pantherettes into the semiﬁnals
against last year’s runnerup
Rutgers.

Rutgers came out playing a
tough solid game and defeated Pitt
in the first game of the best three
out of ﬁve match 15-10.

“Rutgers has never beat Pitt
before and I was conﬁdent despite
losing the ﬁrst game that we would
win the match," said Hebert.

In game two, Pitt came back
playing with the “same kind of
intensity they played with earlier in
the season,-”

  

getting tired about midway through
the game. Pitt downed Rutgers

' 15-112 in -game three.

Rutgers was never even in the
fourth game as Pitt took a 14-1
lead, but let up a little, giving away
five more points and winning the
game and match 15-6.

“Our game plan -was to break
their freshman, a 6-foot-4 hitter,”
said senior captain Cindy Cham-
bers. “When she broke down,
theirentire team broke." - » '

The Rutgers victory set up the
ﬁnals match with Georgetown, who

dominated by Pitt, as the Panther-
ettes downed the Hoyas 15-6.
Game two went much the same as
Pitt won 15-11.‘ I
It was at this point that George-

town began to play championship '

style volleyball. Pitt went ahead
9-2 before the Hoyas staged a
fantastic comeback to tie the game
at 11-all. In a see-saw battle,
Georgetown nipped Pitt 16-14.
With a small, but very noisy
group of Pitt-hating Maryland
players behind them,- the Hoyas

“This championship is much
more gratifying than last year,’,’,
said Hebert. “After Ingrid
(Mueller) transferred, it left a big
hole and along ‘with our big
schedule. there was a lot of

pressure on our program to.

perform.”
The coach cited the efforts of
several Pitt players as outstanding.
“Cindy (Chambers) had a trem-
endous tournament all the way, as

_did Maria Perez in the ‘setting

‘f _v- "5",-' , 

position,” he said. “The best
all-around game, offensively and
defensively was played by Paula
Olsen. Her backcourt play and
attacking were tremendous.”

Hebert continued, lauding the
play of the three freshmen who had
a lot of playing time; Ellen
Mangus, Julie Gaul, and in
particular Robin Kuklais.

“We put Robin in a position in
which she had never played before
and she did an excellent job,” he
said. “That’s the luxury of having

a lot of good players. Wecan just
substitute if someone isn’t' playing
up to her potential.”

Pitt, with a record of 32-19.-3, will
now prepare for the nati0Il3-1
championships to be held at
Southern Illinois beginning Dec. 8.‘
Hebert feels the Pantherettes can
improve on last year’s 13th place
ﬁnish.

“We won't be seeded in the top
10, so it all depends on which pool
we’re placed in,” he said. “A lot
depends on the luck ‘of the draw.”

Top Teams May Not Go

By The Associated Press

Quick, can anybody come up
with a new bowl. You might be

able to- match Alabama and

Southern California.

The bowl picture has become so
preposterous that two of the
nation’s top four college football
teams may not represent their
conferences in major bowls-or even
in any bowls, for that matter-while
the Cotton Bowl could wind up with
a rematch of the October Texas-Ok-
lahoma war.

Unless the National Collegiate
Athletic Association has its head in
the sand, it will see that the 15
so-called major bowls are proving
to be about five too many for decent
matchups. Fourteen berths are
still undecided, although many of»
them are just awaiting the outcome
of conference races.

The Georgia-Auburn game-l5th-
ranked Auburn won 33-13 and
prevented Georgia from nailing
down a Sugar Bowl spot-was—
supposed to clear things up. You
call this clear? ’

The Sugar Bowl will match
Alabama or Georgia against Texas
or‘ Arkansas. But top-rated
Alabama could go to no bowl at all.
It all depends on the Crimson
Tide’s Dec. 1- game with Auburn.
