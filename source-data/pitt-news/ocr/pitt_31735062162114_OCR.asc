Service Stations Warn

End of Week Shutdown

BY MATTHEW KAMBIC

An impending service station.

shutdown threatens Pitt com-
muters with rnore transportation
problems. According to Thomas
Anderson, executive director of the

Pennsylvania Service Station‘

Dealers Association, stations will
be closing by the end of this week.
Stations contacted in the Pitts-
burgh area had different reactions
when questioned about the strike
and about Governor Shapp’s new
voluntary rationing procedures.

“The only thing we know is what
we read in the papers and hear on
the news,” said Curtis Gulf Service
in East Hills. “And if we shut
down it won’t be because of a strike
but because we've run out of gas.”

Ward Sunoco on North Negley
Avenue also faces closing due to a
lack of gasoline. “We’ll go along
with the Govemor’s plans as long
as we stay open, and if we

shut down this week it'll be for one
reason, no more gas.

Pitt Receives Japanese Grant

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

With-the receipt of a $50,000
grant, -Pitt will be the first
educational institution in this area
to receive funding from an
Asian-based company, the
Japanese trading ﬁrm C. Ihto &
Company Limited. _

The grant is directed to
expansion of Pitt's East Asian
Studies program.

An announcement will be made
jointly tomorrow by S. Miyake,
manager-assistant to the president
of C. Ihto & Co. Ltd’s Pittsburgh
ofﬁce, and Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar. '

A’ representative of the Japanese
Embassy in Washington DC said
that although the grant capacity of
the Japanese nation was limited,
and there were many things which
they would like to do in America,
the Embassy is pleased that the
grant will go through. i .

“We are enthusiastic,” he said,
“in promoting the mutual under-
standing of Japanese and Ameri-
can people, especially in pro-
moting understanding between the
people of Pittsburgh and Japan.”
Miyake, speaking for C. Ihto and
Co. Ltd., said his company was
acutely aware of the importance of
Japanese-American cultural rap-
port. The grant was intended to aid
international understandings on
many levels, economic and social
as well as academic, he said.

Pornography Bill Reaches Governor

BY DEBBIE POPP

Employees in the University
Book Center are sending a
telegram urging Governor Shapp to
veto the antipornography bill
passed in the state Senate Monday.

The telegram reads:

“The undersigned employees of
the Book Center of the University
of Pittsburgh strongly object to the
antipomography hill just passed by
the legislature. Its provisions for
permitting each district attorney to
determine what is obscene and for
seizure without trial material he
considers objectionable will cause
great confusion throughout the
state and will dangerously pre-
scribe the people’s right to read

‘ and restrict the Book Center's right

to provide books people want to
read. We urge your veto of this
bill.”

The telegram is not an ofﬁcial
University statement but the
viewpoint of the individuals em-
ployed in the trades department,
said Dwight Fong of that depart-
ment.

The telegram typiﬁes a critical
response by bookstore and theatre

 

managers as well as dissenting
senators. .

Mary.Bonach, manager of the
Book Center, concurs with the
manager of a local adult theatre in
Pittsburgh in claiming the tentative
law is “ridiculous."

   

The bill, which was approved by
a vote of 26-20 in the Senate .and
124-65 in the House, bans the sale,
distribution, or exhibition of books,
movies or other material found
obscene by a jury.

students need this international
world focus to promote greater
friendship, trade, and political
relations with one another,” said
Miyake. .

“It is our hope that this grant
will enable Pitt‘s East Asian Center
to expand its Japanese programs
and to continue its efforts in

establishing mutual understanding «.

between our two countries.”

Dr. William F. Dorill of the East
Asian studies program, and Dr.
Albert C. Van Dusen, Secretary of
the University, were cited as
“instrumental" by Miyake in the

-BY KARL BALDYS .
Scott MacLeod, Associate News
Editor of the Pitt News, was elected

editor-in-chief of the paper last-

night by a 25-16 staff vote.

MacLeod was opposed by Karen
Burgio, Production Editor the
newspaper. Michael Clinton and
Amy Elller, running unopposed,

were elected Co-Business
Managers.
Macleod outlined two objectives

for the improvement of the Pitt
News. “Although I think that
editorial coverage of the campus
has been adequate this year, we
haven’t been speaking out on local,
state, and national issues as we
shoul ,” he said, “I think the
appointment of an editorial page
editor might increase the editorial
clout of the paper.

' MacLeod also emphasized a
change in the paper's Arts section.
“I'd like to revise the Arts section
so that it would be a separate
section of the paper, like the sports
section.”

"Commenting on the upcoming
contract negotiations, Macleod
said that there was a n line of
communications Student
Government. “I feel we have a
better working relationship with
the Student Government.”
MacLeod did not feel the question
of publishers rights would be an
issue in the contract discussions.

Eller and Clinton the new
Co-Business Managers, promised
an expanded program of ad
recruitment. Said Clinton, “We’re
interested, primarily, in expanding
the size of the newspaper. To do
this we have to sell more ads to
provide room for more copy."

When asked about salaries and
the recent questions being asked
about how the Business Managers
are paid Eller replied, “Our

Dorill said both the United States

Schedule Charge”.
Under Review 

Administration
BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Hoping to end controversy over . I

the 25 cent time schedule fee, Pitt

administrators are reviewing alter- ’ 

native proposals, including those

offered by Vice-chancellor of-

Operations Joseph A. Dutton and
Student Government President‘
Mike Furick. ~

The original plan was to charge
students 25 cents for fall time
schedules, Dutton said, in order to
reduce waste and printing costs.

Dutton then modiﬁed his pro-' 

posal by calling for a rental system,
where students would rent time
schedules for 2-3 days for a 25 cent
deposit.

Furick’s idea does not include " 

charging for time schedules.

Students would pick them up at
distribution points and a clerk
would punch validation cards to

greed.”

VVithin the Soviet Union, Gold-
man explained, there are -no
separate organizations which can
divorce environmental issues from
those of industrial growth.

In one example of Soviet
ecological mismanagement, Gold-
nnn cited the removal of gravel
from beaches along the Black Sea
foruseintourist constructioninthe
area, which resulted in erosion of
railway beds along the sea.

“Raw materials,” he added, “in
the Soviet Union are used very
inefficiently.”

Goldman said on the average

“According to the govemment’s
current allotment system, we get
80% ofthesameamountofgas we
pumped in February of last year.
We received 24,000 gallons this
month in our allotment, while we
could pump at least 60,000,” the
owner said.

A South Hills Mobil station said
they would take no action on the
strike or Shapp’s plan until a
meeting later this week with other
service station representatives.

A Vlfilkinsburg station said they
would strike. “As far as Shapp’s
plans go", said Hall's Arco,
“they're just too late. Our gas
deliveries are back to normal, and
we don't have the long lines we
used to have anyway."

“It’s' up to the individual station
as far as I know,” said a Millvale
Texaco station owner. “We are
going along with the shutdown.”

for a shorter period of time than the
United States because of the almost
non—existent restrictions on move-
ment of operations.

The national drive for an
increased Gross National Product
has resulted in social and political
pressure on managers throughout
the Soviet system to increase
production, Goldman said, re-
gardless of the effects on the local
enviromnent.

He said this pressure, com-
bined with the lack of an organized
resistance to indiscriminate use of
natural resources. has resulted in a
Soviet environmental crisis.

tion said the Govemor’sirationing
plans were “bullshit.” “We sell
gas to whoever we want to here.
As far as the strike goes, we’re
running out of gas, so we’ll
probably close soon anyway.”

One Boron dealer said ' that
company-owned stations, including
his, would stay open. “We may
have to bear the brunt of customers
if the strike goes through,” said
the Mt. Washington dealer.
“We'll just have to wait and see
what happens.”

Governor Shapp said his 
stration was studying possible
anti-trust action against oil com-
panies. Independent dealers feel
the companies are purposely
discriminating against them in
order to drive them out of business,
Shapp said.

Pittsburgh commuters will
themselves have to “wait and see"
what the situation will be by the
end of the week. According to

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

A Russian version of the Mardi

Russian folk dancers and singers
will comprise a program titled “An

The folk dancers and choir are a

Penna. Service Stations Threaten Shutdown

Associated Press reports, Dealers
Association director Anderson,
whose organization represents
some 5,300 of the state’s 410,000
stations, said the shutdown would
start Friday or Saturday and last
from 7-10 days. Anderson said the
shutdown would be aimed at
protesting federal regulations gov-
erning gas pricing and distribution.

Shapp’s new system, which is
likely to _become mandatory,
involves using inspection stickers
instead of license plates to
detemtine whether a motorist can
buy gas on an even or odd day of
the month.

Other changes include minimum
purchase prices--$2 for sub-

.compacts, $3 for all other cars,

a system of ﬂags that may be used
by a station to show gas status, and
the placing of a “last car for gas”
sign on the rear of a car in a line,
when the station detemiines it is
about to ‘exhaust its supply.

Fine Arts Building, a “mas-
lenitsa,” the Russian version of the
Mardi Gras, will take place in
Stephen Foster Memorial. In-
cluded in the maslenitsa will be
various Slavic foods.

The maslenitsa festivities occur
a few days before the lenten season
because people abstain from
certain foods during lent, explained
Dr. Alexsey Kiselev, assistant
professor of Slavic Languages and
Literature.

“An Ethnic Evening" will
hopefully be the ﬁrst of a program
where each Slavic nationality will
get a chance to expose its music,
traditions and food, Kiselev added.

According to Jim Bernhardt,

president of the Graduate Students
Organization-Slavic Department,’

“The program was started for a
number of reasons. One was to
include the University and com-
munity together in activities.”

Another reason was to publicize
the activities for the Slavic
Department and graduate students
in it and to make people aware
what the University of Pittsburgh
has to offer in academics,
Bernhardt added.

“The program,” Kiselev stated,
“would also let high school
students come and see what the
University of Pittsburgh is about.”

Kiselev sees the program of
various nationality days as a way of
exposing the University to the
community, having fim and break-
ing away from “the ivory tower of
academics” by having. cultural
activities.

Tickets will be sold at the door
for $3 which includes both the
concert and the maslenitsa.
Tickets for the concert only are $1.
Tickets may also be purchased by
calling the Slavic Department at

to discuss family planning, abor-

Soviet Crisis
(Continued from Page 2)

According to Goldman, within
the Soviet Union calculations of
environmental impact-studies are
often altered or tampered with,
just, Goldman said, as they are
altered in the United States.

Also similar to a US problem,
according to Goldman is a “public
works syndrome” within Russia in
which big construction jobs get
done simply because they are big.
Labelling this “the unrestrained
power of govemment' building,”
Goldman discussed construction of
a large dam in Central Asia, which
went through simply because the
lake was the only major Central

Asian body of water which had not ’

hada dam built’ around it.

Goldman also mentioned a wide
range of Soviet systens which
showed great promise of increased
eﬂiciency in the use of power, such
as common heating for large
sections of cities, and use of steam
from power plants to heat homes
and facilities.

Goldman conceded there were
great promises of improvement in
the Soviet system, and emphasized
many of the ecological problems
were common to any nation which
is expanding industrially, and are
not necessarily inherent in the
socialist system of government.

The lecture was sponsored by
Pitt’s Center for Russian and East
European Studies, and the Cultural
Environment Program.

house is scheduled for 8:00 pm in
the Student Union Annex on
Bouquet Street.

SHACUP was fomied by the
Student Health Service to gain
student input on health related
services at Pitt. Ron Ecldey, a
counselor at the Service explained,
“We interviewed ﬁfty students and
chose a group that we felt would
give us some meaningful student
opinion.”

Co-chairrnan of the committee,
Peter Hoffmann, outlined the
objectives of the committee.
“We’d like to provide the students
with information on family plan-
ning and infomiation on relevant
health topics, like colds. We are
taking pait in a review of the
student health insurance and we
are inaugurating a complaint
service for the students.”

The complaint service is a new
feature of the health advisory
program. The concept’ is; to give
students a chance to change the
health care system where they feel
it needs changing. -“We expect
legitimate complaints and illegit-
imate complaints, but we feel the
majority will be worthwhile from
the standpoint of improving the
health center,” said Hoffmann.

The coffee house Thursday will
feature two ﬁlms. V.D.; A Plague
on our House and Gonorrhea. A

are invited.

Tlre Trutli About Waterlieds

\

Waterbeds represent an exciting and serious improvement
over the old fashioned boxspring/mattress. Doctors have rec-
ognized the therapeutic and hygienic values of the waterbed
for many years. When sleeping on a waterbed your back,
shoulders and hips receive total floatation support. Body
weight is distributed more evenly than is possible on any con-
ventional bed, making a waterbed the most comfortable and
healthful sleeping surface available. A waterbed’s gentle heat
helps relax tense muscles while the firm floating support lulls
you into a deep, restful sleep.

Stop into our showroom and experience the total comfort of a
waterbed for yourself. Free brochure available.

,In a time in which the only
 is change, tradition in and
it self is a bankrupt argument for
.;the preservation of anything. The
;University is the very institution
that has the structure to generate
_ ange. The fact that the
institution is isolated is no excuse
‘f r the continuance of stereotyping
,d general traditionalism, but
should be the very impetus for that
change. Through progressive
implementation of much needed
{day care and health care programs
oncampus, extension of funding of
the existing Women's Studies
Program and staff and the
establishment of an actual
Women's Center, can any real
effect upon change occur. The
women, as well as all other
individuals at Pitt must be made
aware of the seriousness of the
problem that exists as to the
demeaned status we. as students
and women, occupy in the
University. Action must be taken
by us to relegate any reaction!
Radical feminism is called
“Radical” because it is struggling
to bring about really fundamental
 inour society. We do not
believe that women should be
‘integrated into the mile world so
 we can be “just as good as
men.” We believe that the male
world as it now exists is based on
the corrupt notion of “maleness vs
femaleness,” that the oppression
of women is based on this very
nation and its attendant institu-
ﬂons. “Separate but equal” will
get us nowhere, we must eradicate

Dear Ms. Sexton:

'~ -,The article in the Pitt News of
January 23rd relating to the
contemplated changes in the life
sciences area conveys three
possible misconceptions: (1) that
there is “dissatisfaction in the
biology,” department (2) that
"biology" will be strengthened by
a merger with two other depart-
ments, and (3) that there is a
concensus of support for the
merger among the affected depart-
ments. These are largely contained
in remarks attributed to Dean
Rosenberg, but l suspect that
» because his comments are out of
‘ context and greatly abridged or
- modiﬁed, his intent was not quite
what comes through.

The absence of any quotations by
the chairnnn of Biology amidst
; quotations of the chairmen of the
‘A Biochemistry and the Biophysics-
- Microbioloml departments might
 ‘suggest that Biology is too ailing to
voice its opinions on the imponant
" matter of its own future and

is based. Theacademic community
has the potential to assert this
eradication due to its very
isolationism in that we, ‘as
students, are engaged in academic
pursuits to make better or change
the world. By first equalizing
education for women am we as
human beings first and male or
female second, have a hope of
living togetherassuch. Though we
may work in isolated situations, we
can know our larger strategy and
goalsandlmowthatwearepartof
a worldwide struggle for human
liberation.

Friday's rally was noted as a
“call to action.” We must initiate
this action by making ourselves
better aware of existing problems
such as the limited availability of
health and day care facilities. For
example: are you aware that the
family planning program does not
include:

l--Testing for and treating
veneral disease.

2--Pregnancy management.

3--Pre-e-xaisting gynecological
problems

4--Routine gynecological exam-
inations

S--Any gynecological expenses
incurred outside of the student
health service, including hospita-
lization. And...that a $20 fee is
charged?

Are you aware that no actual
University Women’s Center is in
existence?‘ A center, along with
other efforts which would provide a
community in which to pursue
solutions for the redress of
behavior and patterns of dis-
crimination both overt and subtle.

not have found him reticent on the
subject.

Regarding the ﬁrst, and most
important point, Biology does have
some problems, but they are
mostly not of our own making; they
are the result of several processes,
decisions, and lack of decisions.
Our main problem. of course, is too
many undergraduate students and
too few faculty. This is,

assumedly, the “burden" alluded

to.

With regard to the second point,
the grafting of about 25 bio-
chemists. microbiologists and bio-
physicists to an assemblage of 20
biologists probably will not result
in the miraculous creation of more
biologists. Present indications are
that it also will not result in
significant changes of course
offerings--certainly no, or little,
increase in “biology” courses will
occur.

Theﬁnalitem,thatthereisa
concensus of support of the
merger, is probably quite incorrect
and certainly unsubstantiated. No
vote was ever collected from the
total body concerned. A vote of the
Blolom faculty revealed they were
overwhelmingly opposed. How-
ever, when any such polling is
done, no one knows exactly what is

The University as a whole can be
one way of helping to meet this
need by cutting across the
traditional faculty, staff, student
lines and addressing the common
problems faced by women and
others. b
And...that we as students have
no established means of recourse
upon a professor in any situation
deemed by us as sexist or unfair?

Feminism is one of the basic
movements for human liberty. To
view it in any less serious aspect, to
ridicule present-day feminism as
thepassingfancyofahandfullof
malcontents, is to display a
shocking ignorance of the history of
one-half the hunmn race.

Today the American woman can
vote, get an education and own
property. We have obtained one
limited obiective after another,
discovering again and again that
liberation still lay ahead. The
achievements of each successive
movement have served to advance
our status somewhat, to raise our
ambitions, and to re-enlighten us
each time about the nature of our
struggle.

It is the social institution more
commonly referred to as
“academia” that we must attack.
To open the door to true equality
for all today, we must equalize
higher education opportunities
across the board, in substituting
facts for mystiques and myths; in
eliminating the double-standard
placed upon social regulations on
campus; and in eliminating sexual
role models and sexism in the
classroom. A

 

being proposed for approval or
disapproval. That is, the condi-
tions and details of a merger have
been, and rennin, tmdeﬁned.
Until the faculty of the three
departments know what kind of
fusion is goingtotake place] would
expect them to be quite reserved
about committing themselves.

In summary, the “dissatis-
faction” and the “burden” of
Biology could both be readily
alleviated by simply hiring more
biologists for the Biology depart-
ment. This seems not to be the
course chosen by the decision
makers, probably because there
are “problems" within the other
two “life sciences" departments.
it is hoped by those who favor the
merger that these additional
problems can be solved simul-
taneously with the solving of
Biology‘s problems--but, alas, that
is another story.
Sincerely.

Proposed Bureaucracy
Threatens SGB Power

BY TOM SMITH

Rege Kaufman, former SG
president, has proposed three
by-law changes for the consid-
eration of the new Board. One of
these changes involves the estab-
lishment of an executive branch of
government. A

Bureaucracy is usually charac-
terized by hurmn vegetation. ,

Student Government does not need -

the development of an executive
bureaucracy.

The proposed executive branch
consists of ﬁve areas or depart-
ments. They are operations,
academics. Student Government

Board committees, communica-

tions, and “at-large member.”

The purpose for the by-law
change is “to mirror the bureau-
cracy of Student Government and
the University.” However, it
seems that SG will be creating a
bureaucracy to “mirror” a bureau-
cracy.

. A second reason for the
formation of an executive branch is
to “free the Board people of trivial
responsibilities so they might truly
be representative people.”

The Board’s ftmction in this plan
is non-existent. The SGB is to act
as a policy maker instead of a “fact
ﬁnder.” -

According to Kaufman, Board
members “run on ideals and are
elected and never have time to
carry these out because they get
tied up...” It seems the executive
branch will do the work the Board
is elected to do. .

last year’s Board is a classic
example of a “tied up” SGB. It
was strangled by its own inability
and bureaucracy, and not by
non-existent philosophies.

Kaufman argues the Board
cannot discover the facts, consider
the facts, and legislate, even if the
seven elected members spend
20-40 hours a week" on the _iob.

However, for the last’ year Board
members were required to spend
only 8-10 hours a week functioning
as representatives of the students.
Any person involved in a major
activity, other than Student Gov-
ernment, spends more than 8-10
hours a week on the job. Why is it
so unusual to expect the SGB to do
the same?

The former president adds the
Board should talk “philosophies"
instead of performing “small
tasks." According to the proposal
the discussion of “philosophies"
includes allocations priorities.

The distribution of flmds is the
“small task." The Board cannot
direct its attention to serious
problems, if it is to spend all its

  0131):: iﬁttt ﬁrms

time allocating funds. -

Unfortunately. this has been the
case in the past. Board members
must realize there is much more to
their job than determining allo-
cations for student organizations.

An important function should be
the improvement of commun-
ications. But, a separate/branch
will not solve communication
difficulties.

The problem exists because of
the detachednature of the SGB. To
further remove the elected student
representatives from student or-
ganizations will make commun-
ication much more difﬁcult.

Group alienation from the
government will be inevitable.
This should not be the goal of
Student Government again.

This proposal is outrageous
because it fails to deal with the SG
processes that require immediate
attention.

For example, the Committee on
Student Organization lacks direc-
tion. It desperately needs some
instructions from, the SGB, ex-
plaining the committee’s function.
CS0 has the potential to solve the
administrative problems beseiging
Student Government.

The Board should be reluctant to
create any more governmental
agencies. It should determine the
reason existing committees are not
doing the job, and then issue
directives that would force the
committees to function according to
the needs of SG.

The fomiation of an executive
branch would weaken the authority
of the Board members, and allow
the president a free hand in
determining policy. No longer
would elected representatives be
concerned with solving student
problems. _

Their function would be one of a
stamp that either approves or
disapproves, and not one of active
involvement and representation.

The SGB must realize it is the
governing agent of the student
body. The Board cannot expect an
executive branch to Lassume its
responsibilities.

Board members who do not
accept the responsibilities of their
offices do not belong on the Board,
or in SG, or for that matter in any
organized activity. The Board is

elected to do the work, not a,

“trouble-shooter. ”

The new Board should disregard
this proposed by-law change.
Students and their government are
not served by ﬁve “expert”

executive assistants, . but seven,
and they should be the members of
the SG Board.

Bill Reaches Governor I 5

(Corttjnuerl from Page 1)

According to the bill. juries using
county standards would decide if
the material were obscene based on
last years US Supreme Court
ruling which said material could be
outlawed when: p
--The average person _applying
contemporary community stan-
dards would ﬁnd that the subject
matter taken as a whole appeals to
prurient ‘interest. ‘ ,
--The subject matter depicts or
describes sexual conduct in a
patently offensive way.

--The subject matter taken as a
whole lacks serious literary, artis-
tic. political, or scientiﬁc value.

The bill also prohibits the display
of any explicit sexual nnterial in
areas to which minors might have
access. Explicit sexual material is_
deﬁned as anything depicting
nudity, sexual conduct or sado-
masochistic abuse.

Conﬁscation of all the alleged
obscene material in the defen-
dant’s possession would be per-
mitted as soon as the ‘county judge
issues a preliminary injunction.

The court would then have the
authority to destroy the material
when la’ preliminary injunction
becomes permanent and the
defendant's rights to further
judicial review are exhausted.

Violaters of this act could be
ﬁned up to $5,000 and face
imprisonment up to two years. A
district attorney could have the

Most criticism of the bill centers
on the provision directing a jury to
apply county standards in deter-
mining if something is obscene.

An administrative assistant in
Senator Thomas Lamb's ofﬁce said
the bill would allow a considerable
degree of variance in 
and enforcement in A the 67
Pennsylvanian coimties. Some
people will be denied the right to a
movie, magazine, or book because
their neighbors think it explicit.

Another Senator's ofﬁce stated
the bill would allow a few powerful
ofﬁcials in the county the right to
decide what people shall or shall
not read.

One Oakland book retailer not
too concerned with the potential
lossing income said the bill is
unfortunate. “I pity the maga-
zines. lpity the people. Playboy.
Penthouse, Oui, or Playgirl would
not be pemiitted on the stands, in

BY JIM MALONEY

They might call Pittsburgh the
blues capital of the East after this.
Willie Dixon. James Cotton,
Sunday night services with the
sugar daddy himself -- B.B. King.
Seems they picked up a few fans in
a city known marketwise as a Three
Dog Night town.

The show at the Mosque Sunday
was an emotional event. Jimmy
Cotton, a veteran of a decade with
Muddy Waters, went all out in the
warm-up set. Speed guitarist
Mattie Murphy drove the band
superbly, and Cotton’s mlmnastics
on the “Mississippi Saxophone”
sent the Memphis beat rockin’
down the aisle.

The King’s men took the stage.
Sonny Freeman and the Unusuals.
his seven piece touring band, suit
B.B.’s style perfectly. Like Elvis,
King surrounds himself with the
best backup available, each
musician polished to a high gloss.
They do no wrong. As they rolled
into their standard opener “Every-
day I Have the Blues,” the big man
strutted onstage. The crowd
erupted ashe hit the strings--the
coveted sound, copied but never
equalled.

Then the classic “How Blue Can
You  F1nger's poppin', ﬁsts
clenched. he peeled off a searing
guitar solo that told of misery and
hard times. Lucille’s weeping
conversation with the tenor sax of
Bobby Forte served as an intro to
“Some Help I Don't Need." Sweat
was shining on King's face, and his
eyebrows danced up and down as
he berated his cheating woman.
Swaying like Cobras to his crying
guitar. the fans were mesmerized

by the Pied Piper of the blues.
“You better tell the iceman
next time he better leave some
ice.
Tell the postman
to ring more tan twice.
When I get home from work
better be some groceries left on
the shelf.
Tell that slick insurance man
he better write some insurance
on himself.”

B.B.'s crowds are different than
most. It's not always applause, but
shrieks of joy and encouragment.
“Tell it, B! Shake it, don’t break
it!" And he responds everytime,
sailing notes into the darkness like
frisbees. His guitar isn't an
instrument, it’s an appendage,
with snazzy punctuation for every
linel He uses no special effects, no
reverb or super doo—wah. He
doesn't expose himself. He
doesn’t kill chickens or lambs. He
doesn’t arrive on a skateboard, and
his clothes don't light up. Like the
man who smokes Camel Filters, the
king of the‘ blues needs no
gimmick.

Center stage for “The Thrill is
Gone,” B.B.‘s ﬁrst biggest chart
success. The band shufflin’ in
place behind him, King picked his
way through a solo that probably
loosened a few teeth.

Glaring into the lights, King told
of his last visit to the Mosque, and
how they nearly missed the plane
home. An American Airlines
official called the plane back from
the end of the rtmwaytopickupthe

kind--Pittsburgji will always be
very special to me.”

He returned to kick into “The
Saints Go Marching In." By now,
fans were uprooted from their
seats. and pressed toward the
stage to get close to the man. Then
came a tough instrumental, com-
plete with his patented falsetto
moan. King shuffled along the
stage, dueling with Forte, taunting
pianist Ron Levy.

The screaming notes poured into
the air, the band chugging full
steam behind him. Like the
huckster at the county fair with his
Mondo-Vego Tomato Dicer, he
could make his guitar do anything--

B.B.’s dressing room is alive with

King drums on the table and
strokes his face with a towel. Soon
he's up, pushing chairs at people,
worried about everyone being
comfortable. King is an amateur
pilot, and I asked if he needed
tower clearance for what he laid
down tonight.

“The Day of the Dolphin"

 

‘Dolphins Steal Film Off Scott

BY DREW PORVAZNIK
A dolphin tries to assassinate the
President of the United States‘?
Yes folks, that's the story behind
Mike Nichols’ The Day of the
Dolphin starring George C. Scott

and Pittsburgh's Fritz Weaver.
And "it's a serious movie!

In the ﬁlm, Scott plays a research
scientist who has trained dolphins
to speak and understand simple
English.

George C. Scott stars in the Mike Nichols ﬁlm, The Day of the Dolphin.

‘The Thrill Was Here

(Continued from Page 6)
He's up now, prancing around
the room, laughing and tellin’
stories. Like last year in Paris,

- carousing with bluesman Memphis

Slim. “We hadn’t seen each other
in a while, so we did the town.

 Wound up eatin’ monkey. Some

kinda delicacy there, but I'd hate to
tell you what it tastes like.” ,-
He can’t be nice enough, trying

to talk to everyone in sight. “My ’

English isn’t the best,” he says to
no one in particular. Apologies
from a man whose music speaks all

' languages.

A man from Sony wants to sell
him a casset nmchine. Jimmy
Cotton’s countin’ his cash, and the
band guys all have their coats on.

telling jokes and havin’ a good
time. Finally he’s ready, the
Boston concert is two nights away.
“Sorry I can’t spend more time
with you, but thanks for comin’
in.” Andijust like that, the thrill
was gone, but the memory went
home with everybody.

....n—. _— ju .-

The two dolphins (Alpha and
Beta) are later kidnapped by one of
Scott's assistants who trains Beta
to blow up the President's yacht by
carrying a magnetic explosive mine
on her back.

The irony is that the foundation
which ﬁnances Scott’s research is
behind the assassination plot.

The ﬁlm raises the problem of
unscrupulous individuals using an
honest scientist's research for evil
purposes--the movie’s theme.

Examples of this might be
nuclear research in which one may
develop nuclear weapons that
might be stolen and given to
political terrorists. Another case is
artiﬁcial life developed from a
test tube in which a scientist
secretly grows humans to be used
to carry out some criminal scheme.

However, the impact of this
concept is hardly felt in the movie
mainly because the story is so silly
and undeveloped.

If Mike Nichols, the director,
intended to copy the formula used
in The Day of the Jackal, then he
failed. The assassination plot is
never fully developed, the sus-

‘penseisminimalandtheclinnx

comes off like a dud ﬁrecracker in
contrast to the Fred Znnemann
ﬁlm.
In-The Day of the Jackal, there
was an intriging and suspenseful
race between “the J acka ” and the
French police who were to uncover
the plot to assassinate General de
Gaulle. V V
This race was like a chess game

BY DOUGLAS E. GEBHARD
Miss Mitchell's concert was
somewhat of a disappointment
after my idea of her was let down. I
somehow expected her to appear
on stage with a simpler dress

 style...her platforms and beige

sequin halter gown stunned me and

It I questioned my irnage--or the

image that had been given to
me--which somehow crazily inﬂu-

enced my listening enjoyment.

TomScottandtlIeLAExpress

rlwhoarethepeople backingherup

on the lp] presented the audience

. with a little less than mediocre jazz

set...wlIich is the thing to do these

 .. days I suppose. Their accom-

paniment on her first set was too
over-powering. For instance, the

lfguitar was inaudible at times and

iOscar for Alpha & Beta?

(Conlin/u’/I from Page 7)

where “the Jackal" and the police
tried to outsmart each otherand to
guess their opponent's next move.

This “chess formula" built sus-
pense to a high degree and led to a
powerful climax. .

In the dolphin film, the
assassination plot doesn’t unravel
until half of the movie is finished.
In addition, the attempt to foil the
plot runs too smoothly let alone
become as fIIlly developed as the
Jackal scheme. Hence, little
suspense resulted.

Unclear qualities such as the

foundation being more interested

’ in a dead president than in Scott's

"pure research" coupled with
doorknobs that turn at night
without explanation weaken the
already easy ﬂowing movie.

so was the piano. Her live versions
certainly were different from the
simple album tracks.

One thing which I didn't wholly
appreciate or understand was her
new “Woodstock"...an upbeat hip
jazz tempo with loud fuzz guitar
and funky (real) piano-—not by her.
Joni sat at the grand and played
and sang her way through the first
two verses and then ‘stood up.
made it over to the mike (where she
had her regrets taped) and snapped
her fingers and made it look like a
night club act. In between the
correct lyrics she added cute little
lines like...“and we were playing
in'the mud, having a real good
time..."

The album doesn't indulge itself
into such an act...the mastering is

At least in the Jackal ﬁlm, the
reason for de Gaulle's assassina-
tion was explained. A group of
men felt the general had betrayed
France during the Algerian War, so
they hired a hit man to knock de
Gaulle off.

The Day of the Dolphin also
contains two very absurb moments.

The first is when the foundation
members carry on a conversation
with the two dolphins, Alpha and
Beta, and the second absurdity is
when Scott instructs Alpha how to
foil the assassination attempt.

For children seven to fourteen
years old the movie is probably a
most entertaining one. The kids
will love watching the dolphins and
listening to them speak.

The dolphins steal the show
away from George C. Scott and are
the real stars of the picture.

fantastic, as is to be expected from
Asylum (ASYLUM 7E-1001) and
the musicianship isn't as blatant as
I have said.

Nothing can take away the talent
this woman has...my prejudices to
the simple music she did in the past
are my hangups...but I can and do
recognize this--Joni Mitchell is
undoubtedly the finest female
lyricist l’ve ever encountered. And
what is IrIore, she has changed for
her particular needs--be they
musically, socially, psycho-
logically, or whatever.

T‘unes like “Twisted” make me
believe that she’s gone through
those changes...“My analyst told
Ine...”, but in...well, come to think
of it she’s really pleading. Every
song has a prayer of sorts...“Still I
sent up my prayer/ Wondering who
was there to hear...” from.“'Ihe
Same Situation.”

To go into every tune with the
attitude of ﬁnding out Joni’s
problems is of course ludicrous but
somehow intriguing. The star is
never separated from the mas-
ses--we always want the gossip so
we read Circus or Rolling Stone to
read what's happening in the rock
world. Not that it is inherently bad
to want to know about those people
we've put on the pedestals as long
as we understand them as

.people...they can screw up too.

I was most impressed with “Free
Man in Paris." On the ﬁrst look I
didn't think about it too much, but
after some discussion with _ my
friend Dick I’ve come to the
conclusion that it could be about a
dear friend of hers...none other
than Stephen Stills. You see the
big clue is the line...“And wander
Down the Champ d‘Elyses...”
Stephen met his wife there and has
sung about that scene in one of his
tunes. It's really I guess, an
allegory about “the Business”...-

that big thing we call rock music
and all the implied magicit holds.

The album has some good
heartbeat songs. That is...a song
that you feel in you when she sings
it...the music...that open timing
which she ﬂoats past your ear...the
addition of an electric bass which
accentuates her harnIonies...or the
lyrics--those lyrics which only Miss
Mitchell can create.

So where are we to go? If I were
asked about my feeling on the
overall picture I've had and have
with this lp and concert I'd have
to say this: I loved the album
before the concert. I wrote a

 

review afterwards which was so
cynical my friend Dick talked me
out of publishing it..I was
disappointed at her appearance at
the Mosque. Now...I’ve grown out
of my crabbiness and am back to
loving Miss Mitchell. What I might
have done here is this; my own
editorial views on music have
shown through...sorry. I love
Joni's past and present and
wouldn't wish anything but good
fortune to her. I only regret that

rock has become what it is...a star _

maker machine that seems to have
gone crazy...

Ridl  
Sounds Off

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

 

Success has ﬁnally got to Buzz Ridl. ,
Throughout last season’s weekly basketball luncheons, the likeable.

\ Pitt basketball coach would calmly tell everybody about his upcoming

game, never cracking a joke or making an issue over anything.

But now Ridl is in the limelight. He no longer has to take a back seat
to all those small college coaches who annually scurry off to playoffs in
March.

Buzz Ridl tells jokes now, and he also speaks his mind. At this
week’s luncheon at the Greentree Holiday Inn, Ridl lashed out at the
critics who said his 21-1 Panthers don’t belong among the nations top
ten floor teams. ' -

“I didn’t bring this whole thing up,” he declared, “but it's been
brought up, and I think we need to do some research if we’re going to
be making statements about out schedule.”

As he usually does, Ridl made things easy for the media. He did all
the research for us.

Ridl proceded to match last year’s‘ schedule, which was criticized as
being too severe, with this year’s, which has been called a cakewalk.

“We played North Carolina last year, but they didn’t want to play us
this season, so we substituted Duke. Duke’s not as good as North
Carolina, but they are an ACC team. .

“Last year we beat Rutgers at home, this year we beat them on the
road. We played Duquesne, Penn State, and West Virginia the same
number of times as last year. Insteadof Southern Illinois in the Steel
Bowl, we played at Arkansas.

“We lost to Virginia at home last year, this year we beat them down
there. We don’t have UCLA this season, but we have Horida State, a
big, strong club.”

Ridl went on to point out that Harvard and VV1sconsin were easily
replaced by Cornell and Connecticut.

“Last year we almost beat Notre Dame on the road, this year we play
down at South Carolina. We played Davidson at home last year, this
year we beat them on the road.”

There were several relatively easy teams on the schedule both years.
“Youngstown away is tougher than Mt. Union at home, and the same
goes for VV1ttenbe_rg at home compared to Westminster away.

“St. Francis and Buffalo also can be considered equally difﬁcult
games.”

Ridl’s point becomes obvious. While the really top teams weren’t on
the card this year, many of the country’s top 30 remained.

The Pitt mentor was not ﬁnished. Using Basketball Weekly's Top
50, he showed how many teams some of the top-ranked schools play.

Providence plays nobody in the top 20, and just three in the top 50.
long Beach played only two of the nations top 50, although one of those
two was Marquette. Nevada—Las Vegas plays only one school in the top
50. That game was against Houston, and they lost. -

“Pitt has Syracuse, South Carolina, and Florida State on the
schedule," said Ridl, and all of these schools have been in the top 20 at
some time.” The Panthers play a total of six of the nation’s top 50.
which is certainly competitive with the rest of the nation, to say the
least.

Minnesota coach Bill Musselman was a visitor to the luncheon, and
he expressed his philosophy about schedules. “If someone asks me
about my schedule, I don’t even answer him.”

The Pitt basketball team could
become the winningest of all time
tonight with a victory over Temple
at the Field House. The two teams
will tip off at 8 pm. and the Pitt
junior varsity hosts Allegheny

Temple sports a four game

mark, impressive ﬁgures, but
nothing to compare to Pitt.

The Panthers are now 21-1,
riding the longest wimiing streak in
college basketball, and have not

Icers Blank Duquesne;

Tartans Tie Indiana

BY BART MACK
Associate Sports Editor

The stage has been set for the
final regular season rematch
between the Pitt Hockey Club and
the Camegie-Mellon Tartans. And
like last season, Pitt has received a
little bit of help in the battle to
regain the top spot of the Western
Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey Asso-
ciation.

Pitt continued_ its domination of
the teams running beneath second
place by blanking the Duquesne
Dukes, 5-0 at the Civic Arena
Sunday night, but the “upset” of
the night came in the ﬁrst half of
the doubleheader.

It was a replay from last season,
as the Camegie-Mellon Tartans
had to settle for a 1-1 tie with
Indiana. In fact, if the game was a
couple of seconds longer, C-MU
would have tasted its first defeat-of
the campaign.

Withjust ﬁve seconds left to play
in the game, Indiana’s Pete
Hanson picked up a loose puck at
center ice and found a clear path
toward the Tartans nets. C-MU
goaltender Jeﬂ Hart skated out
almost to his own blue line to
challenge Hanson, but the veteran
Indiana forward deked around him
and ﬁred a backhand that hit the
back of the nets a split second after
the ﬁnal siren sounded and the
green light came on, locking the
red light off.

The Tartans outshot Indiana,
39-14. but Ken Richert put on a
spectacular show in the Indiana
nets. That's the same Indiana
team Pitt trounced 10-2 just one
week ago.

C-MU still leads the WPII-lA_
with a three point spread over Pitt,
although the Panthers have a game

 

in hand on them. Even without
that “ gift" from the Tartans, a Pitt
victory on Saturday night would
insure the Panthers a ﬁrst place
ﬁnish by virtue of total goals
scored.

But the Panthers still have that
“C-MU hex” hanging over their
heads, having not defeated the
Tartans in almost two years.

For the first time this season.
however, Pitt ﬁnally has a full team
together to face C-MU. Duke.
Shaeffer is back from his suspen-
sion, Rick Vemon is back in his
usual goal scoring form and Glenn
Hyde returned to the blue lines last
Sunday night after missing the
previous game.

Vemon continues to pace the Pitt

attack. notching another pair of _ 

tallies against the Dukes. Centers
Joe Testa and Charly Hagins also
pumped the puck into the net once
as did defenseman Russ Stump,
who has scored three goals in the
last two games.

Panther netminder J umpin’ John
DeFazio recorded his second

shutout of the season and second '

over the Dukes by turning away

just 16 shots. '

have mathematically clinched
playoff spots...lndiana's sudden

Los Angeles, AP -- Coaches John
Wooden of UCLA and Bob Boyd of
Southern California are surprised
for far different reasons, yet the
basketball standings for each club
today read exactly the same.

That’s because UCLA was shot
down in the Northwest by first
Oregon State and then Oregon
while the Trojans of USO beat both
of them.

“We were the best club in

Oregon last weekend," said Boyd.
“While I felt we could win two
games there, I'm very surprised to
come home in first place. I thought
only that we would firmly establish
ourselves in second place."

Wooden was at a loss to explain
why his defending collegiate
champions sagged from an 18-1
over-all record and No. 1 nationally
to lose 56-51 to Oregon State and
61-57 to Oregon.

He said he considered line-up
changes and sought something to
make his cage Bruins hungrier.

UCLA and USC are both 18-3
ovcr—all and 7-2 in the Pac-8.
Southern California has lost to
Washington State and UCLA, but
has won four straight.

Both clubs face the same teams
before going against each other in
the conference ﬁnale and perhaps
for entry into the NCAA tourna-
ment. This weekend Washington

Pitt Still 7th

RALEIGH, N.C. AP —— After
many weeks of trying harder, North
Carolina State basketball Coach
Nomi Sloan ﬁnds it nice to be the
No. 1 team of college basketball.

Sloan’s team was top—ranked in
the Associated Press poll this
week, ending a long run as number
two behind perennial champion
UCLA. The Bruins dropped two
games over the weekend and fell to
third.

NC State, with a 20-1 record,
edged Notre Dame by a slim
margin for the top spot.’

Despite its new status, Sloan
said his team will still try harder.

“I think it will help us. It comes
at a good time to give a boost to our
morale. The teams we'll be playing
from nowon are all Atlantic Coast
Conference teams, and they
couldn’t be gunning for us any
more than they are already. We’ll
have a little more pride.”

Sloan was informed of the poll
results at practice Monday after-
noon. “Is that right?” he asked.
Told it was, he said, “We’re proud
and pleased.”

Sloan stopped practice brieﬂy to
inform his players. Their reaction
was restrained.

“lt’s not that we’re not
enthused,” said 7-foot-4 center
Tom Burleson. “It’s just that
we’ve got a lot of things on our
minds,” including a home game
with Duke Wednesday night.

Sloan said the sports writers who
picked the Wolfpack “had a good
case. '

“We’re a vastly improved ball

together much better particularly
with our press. We've beaten two
of the top ﬁve teams Maryland and
North Carolina on their home
courts; we beat Purdue on its home
court when it was leading the Big
Ten.”

Though the poll recognition is
nice, Sloan said, it’s not the goal
the team is seeking. Pursuit of the
real goal starts next month with the

ACC toumament, which NC State-»_-K, K:

must win to enter the NCAA
toumament.

"We want to be No. 1

Rick Weaver

*    Utility Man In Track

 LUXURY

,; i tained.

BY RICK STOUFFER

He's the all-American boy,
mom's apple pie, running with a
total commitment to track. Who is
he? Rick Weaver is the answer,
coach Jim Banner’s all-around
good guy.

= Weaver is the kind of guy you
would let your sister go out with: a
quiet, very subdued kind of person
who couldn't hurt a ﬂy, or so it

.- xseems.

But on a track surface the real
Rick Weaver shines through
whether in the 600 or the two-mile
relay. He is burning tracks all
around the east with a very intense
desiretowinagainstthebestthere
is.

Talking to Weaver, the impres-
sion is of a happy easy-going guy
who takes everything in stride.

“I’m having a good season this
year, the best since I came to Pitt.
(He took second place at the Pitt
Invitational and a third at the
Michigan State Relays.) This is
really only my second good season.

When I was a sophomore I hurt my
ankle and couldn't practice, ruining
my indoor season. Then when a
junior I had the ﬂu, which
discouraged me for the year."

lfyou rtmtrack and it is not an
Olympic year everyone wants to
qualify for the National cham-
pionship [this year to be held in
Detroit March 8th and 9th.]
Weaver is no exception.

“My goal has to be to qualify for
thenationalsinthe 600. It takes a
1:11 toqualifywithmybestsofara
1:l1.5 so I still have some work to
do.”

Pvebeenintracksincelwasin
eighth grade, Weaver continued,
Most of what I learned was on my
own. The coaches had other
outside interests. Pitt’s facilities

‘anditscoachingwerethereasonl

came here. I’ve gotten a lot of
individual help from coach Banner
and it seens to have helped.”
Running track, there is a
tendency to become bogged down
in running only one event. Rick,
mostly a 6()0-yard runner will be

running the half mile this Saturday
at the Ohio State Invitational.

“I really like running the half
mile but I don't consider myself a
quarter miler. You have to be
really fast to run it. Good times are
what make the season go fast."

“Rick is one of the most
coachable people on the squad,”
said Banner. “He is a great team
man who produces all the time and
is indeed a pleasure to coach."

The sandy-haired Weaver is
always concentrating, either in a
meet or at practice sessions. “I
always concentrate in workouts
because it helps me in meets. But
during warmups I goof off as much
as anyone. (Perhaps his solid
image has a crack.)

I’m looking forward to the Ohio
State Invitational and the Eastems
(Eastern championships at Prince-
ton March 1st and 2nd.) Then with
a sly smile he added, “I have a
pretty good chance to place there."

The all-American boy is alive and
well and running track at Pitt.

While Boyd acknowledged the
UCLA losses probably commanded
the most interest, the man in his
eighth year as head coach of the
Trojans commented:

“Friday we_ played the best _

basketball of any team since I've
been at USC. We shot 65 per cent
from the ﬂoor and played ﬁne
defense and at Oregon with its
rabid home crowd. Most signi-
ﬁcant, we had the best execution
since ljve been here.”

While Boyd had his best,
Wooden had his disappointment.
He doesn’t think the 6-11 Walton,
College Player-of-the-Year in both

1972 and 1973, has played as well

"since his back injury suffered Jan.

7. '

“He has had some ﬁne games,”
the coach said, “but he has not
worked as well with the team.”

Asked if ’ he anticipated lineup
changes, Wooden said, “Yes, I
won't go any farther.”
4 Speculation arose that freshman
Jim Spillane, a playmaker guard,
might ﬁgure in revised planning.

Asked about team morale, the
coach of NCAA champions nine of
the past 10 years, answered, “It’s
not very good. They are a little
frustrated. There are mental errors
and we’re not playing with the
same intentness.”

Piranhas Host Allegheny i

Tomorrow At Trees

The Pitt Women's Swim Team
has qualiﬁed nine swimmers for
the Eastern Championships in
Springﬁeld, Mass.; six of these
swimmers have also qualiﬁed for
the National Championships to be
held at Penn State next month.
The last chance for the Piranhas to
qualify more swimmers for post--
season competition will be tomor-
row night, as they host Allegheny
College.

The last meet of the season for
the Piranhas will be highlighted by
the ﬁnal appearances of three
seniors: Anne Wallisch, Kitty
Martin and Annamarie Crelli, all
four-year letter swimmers. They
will be honored in the meet, which
begins at 7:00 pm at Trees Hall
Pool.

The Allegheny College Women"s
SwimTeamisinits ﬁrstyearand
subsequently the Piranhas don’t
really know what to expect. '
Swimming for Allegheny, though,
are Joan Lange and Barb Moore,
Pittsbin-gh area AAU ‘swimmers.

Taking the Piranhas’ vast improve- .

menl into account and the
inexperience of the Allegheny
squad, Pitt is hopeful for a win,
leaving them a record of four wins,
three losses. ~
Joining Seniors Wallisch and
Crelli in the trip to Eastems will be
Pitt swimmers Mickey Chamber-
lain, Mamie Heretick, Vicky

Coleman. Glynnis Lyons, Sue I

Price, Bert Snoznik and Sharon

l Schoelkopf.

Freshman Angie Lopez qualiﬁed
by large margins for the big meet,
but will be competing in the
Central American Games in Santo
Domingo representing Puerto Rico.

She will rejoin the Piranhas when -

they travel" to Penn State for
Nationals, however, other Nation-
al qualiﬁers include Heretick,
Coleman, Lyons, Price and Snoz-
nik.

Assistant Coach Kate Mathison
is satisﬁed with the season. “The
swimmers have worked hard and
improved their times, including
those not going to Eastems. I’m
looking forward to everyone doing
their’ best times this meet and
perhaps qualifying a few more
swimmers for post-season compe-
tition.” '

Reflecting on the season,‘ team
co-captain Sue Price feels that
there has been improvement in the

women's program. ‘-‘We now have ~

the opportunity to participate in

competition such as Eastems and -V

Nationals. When our seniors
started swimming, they had a three
month season. with no post-season
competition. Seeing what changes
have come about in four years, we
can only be optimistic about the
future."

Paris, Ky. AP -- Veterinarians
should be able to determine
whether Secretariat's ﬁrst attempt
at stud was successful about April
1.

The Triple Crown winner was
able to get two of three test mares
in foal earlier this year, but
Monday was his first attempt with
a thoroughbred mare--My Card.

My Card, by My Babu Ace Card,
is owned by Walter Jeffords, a
utilities investment consultant who
owns a farm near Lexington.

The mare was the wimier of
seven races and $98,404.

Veterinarians are able to make
pregnancy tests after about 42
days. The gestation period for a
mare is about 335 days.

Syndicated for more than $6
million early last year, Secretariat

was the first horse since Citation in
1948 to win racing's Triple
Crown--the Kentucky Derby,
Preakness Stakes and the Belmont.

The syndicate agreement, which
would give members posting
$180,000 one breeding right per
year to the young stallion, was
disrupted last week when veter-
inarians declined to certify Secre-
tariat as fertile.

The presence of what veter-
inarians described as spermato-
gonia. immature cells in the
horse’s semen, was the reason
given for not certifying fertility.

Claiborne Farm President Seth
Hancock said a change in the
syndicate agreement was being
worked out to allow Secretariat at
least one breeding season.

legal differences. .

NHL President Clarence Camp-
bell announced that the settlement
agreement was signed by both
leagues before US Dist. Court
Judge Leon A. Higginbotham.

The agreement was submitted to
Judge Higginbotham here today,
and the jurist entered a consent
decree approving the settlement.

The long-discussed peace move
disposes of all pending litigation
between teams operating in both
leagues.

Campbell stressed that the
agreement was not in any sense a
merger.

Under the settlement, the WHA
agrees to respect the new NHL
player option clause adopted last
November. In turn, certain NHL
teams which have elected to do so
have committed themselves to play

JOBS

Not everyone seems to realize that charg-
ing phone calls to a fraudulent credit card
number is against the law. And that the
law sets heavy penalties for violators.

In this state, there's a fine of up to $500
—or one year in jail—or both. (In some
states, fines range as high as $10,000, with
jail sentences of up to 10 years.)

Modern electronic computer systems are

15 preseason exhibition games
against WHA clubs.

In return for dropping its suits
against the NHL, the WHA will be
reimbursed $1.75 million for legal
expenses to date.

“It would be wholly misleading
to describe the settlement of the
legal dispute as a merger,”
Campbell said in his three-
paragraph announcement.

“No such arrangement is con-
templated," Campbell said.

The settlement provides that the
WHA will respect the new NHL
player option clause adopted last
November.

In turn,
which have elected to do so have
committed thenselves to play
WHA teams in 15 preseason
exhibition games.

The WHA will be reimbursed for
its legal expenses in the amount of
$1.75 million. There are no private
arrangements, whatsoever.

The WHA" has agreed to
reimburse the NHL in the event it

‘ incurs any liability in litigation with

the former WHA New York
franchise which has stated it will
not join in the settlement.

The NI-IL’s Board of Governors

had approved the agreement

The WHA boards approved it
Monday.

One of the important concessions
in getting the WHA board to
approve was agreement by the
Toronto Toros not to make an issue
of the nonavailability of Maple Leaf
Garden in Toronto to the WHA.

Earlier, the NHL board had
opposed the agreement, but

Campbell said Friday that some 
modiﬁcations resolved that situa- 5
tion.

He did not elaborate.
