Students Map Out Boycott A

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN

NEW ORLEANS, La. Nov. 17.
1972—Students representing 70
universities and colleges from
every region of the country met
today with students from the New
Orleans and Baton Rouge branch-

es of Southern University to map .

out a policy of support for the stu-
dent boycott at Southern Univer-
sity. '

The boycott at-the primarily
black university resulted last

Thursday after the death" of two
students at Baton Rouge by what
the University’s Student Govern-
ment described as “Number
three shot gun shells fired by the
police.”

The students, representing Stu-.

dents for a Democratic Society,

(SDS), the Progressive Labor
Party _ (PLP), and Southern Uni-
versity campus-organizations,
have called for in an official press
release, a demonstration “to con-

’Object of State Council

by LARRY PANSINO

In an effort to provide a mech—‘

anism for student participation in
the policy-making process, the
Pennsylvania Department of Ed-
ucation has formed a Student Ad-
visory Council. Jerome M. Zieg-
ler. the Commissioner of Higher

Education, described the makeup
and functions of the Council in a
letter_ to the Deanof Student Af-
fairs,Dr. Alfred L. Moye.

“It seems appropriate,” wrote
Ziegler, “that . . . I provide a
means -whereby students can
.:!I;3’eak on issues critical to their
education and offer advice-on fu-
ture directions‘ of higher educa-
tion. A
“The Council will be broadly
representative, including students
and recent graduates of all seg-
ments of Pennsylvania higher ed-
ucation.” Ziegler ‘said that a total
of 32 members will be elected

from those nominations received.

from the various colleges and uni-
versities across the state.

Dean Moye and members of
Pitt’s Student Affairs Advisory
Committee '(SAAC) fond they
could not accept a limitation of
only one nominee as suggestedgby
Ziegler. “It is impossible,” re-
lated Moye. “or one person to
adequately represent us. Pitt’s
composition—urban, large. diver-
sified~—is the reason. but we don’t
know if the state will alow our
additional nominations."

Therefore, the SAAC chose four
nominees from the students who
applied for the positions. Two
nominees are undergraduate, one
is a graduate student. nd the
fourth is from the School of Edu-
cation. The SAAC voted on the ap-
plicants tuesday, screening them
from the statements they sub-
mitted.

Lyn Marcus, speaking on behalf
of the National Caucus of Labor
Committees (NCLC) this past

Wednesday outlined the socialist '

strategy in_Athe post-election per-
iod. ’ .

The primary objective of the so-
cialists. according to Marcus. is
to sabotage the efforts of the Nix-
on administration to p/ut its Phase
III program’ into full operation.
Marcus termed the Phase III op-
eration as "productivity bargain-
ing.”

Marcus said that the reason for
this new phase was that the_nation
was currently in the throes of a
depression.

The system has broken down

demn the deaths of the two stu-
dents at the Baton Rouge while
supporting the strike of Southern
University as the basis for a
movement against the racist po-
licies of this country.”

The release explains further
that “the action called for Mon-
day. Nov. 27, will hopefully result
in nationwide shutdowns and/or
demonstrations at colleges and
universities in order to support
the boycott and build for a general
demonstration’? at a date yet to
be announced.

The representatives also called

, for the formation of a national_
strike information center in New '

Orleans to coordinate all media
releases “and serve as a clearing
house for the continuation of the
struggle.”

Other decisions reached at the
meeting included the formation of
legal assistance funds from cam-
puses across the country and rec-
ognition of the need for a coalition
of the dominantly black universi-
ties in the country “to struggle
for a new approach to education.”

Larry Jones, from the Baton
Rouge campus, explained that
“the significance of thisstrike is
that black students are demand-

and the effects of the depression
will soon hit the industrial areas
across the nation.” Marcus warn-.
ed. ’

He added that the average per-
sonhas not yet complained of the
depression because “they have
not yet felt it in terms that they
recognize.”

Marcus further stated that in
order to cope with the situation,
President Nixon would resort to
“Bonapartist police state meas-
ures which were not seen in 1971
or 1972. He equated Phase III with
the economic policies of _Hitler
and Mussolini from 1933-1937.

Marcus expects that the admin-
istration will resort to counter-in-
surgency policies in order to im-

Pitt's Student Government
%ard_ waded through a mountain
of old business and allocations
recommendations in its regular
meeting Thursday night. The only
new. motion was a request from
WPGH’s Business Manager J. L.

Pierce for $3,709.16 to buy a new '

transmitters.

Board member Terry Sadler
used the request as an opportun-
ity to charge WPGH with being
"insensitive to the needs of black
students” and “unresponsive" to
blacks who wish to work at the
station.

Another member, Dave Bluey,
was. indignant about the WPGH
tactic, of “storming the Board”
ff)!‘ emérgency funds.

 

»  ., ..

  

It was generally agreed, how-
ever, that the large student in-
vestment had to be protected.
‘from the waste of “broadcasting
to nowhere,” and the-request was
passed unanimously after 45 min-
utes of heated exchange. Pierce
said that WPGH could be broad-
casting again in time for winter
term.

Other appropriations approved
included $25,000 for the Student
Government programs to be held
during winter term. and small
amounts for the Arnold Air Socie-
ty and the Society of Automotive
Engineers... Four hundred and for-
ty dollars and sixty cents was

granted for the purchase of a port- ‘

able color television to be placed
in the McCormick Hall lobby. as

Board member Walt Wills stat-
ed that this is actually the do-
main of the ‘Office of Student
“Strife” and wanted to know what
they were doing besides “mak-
ing it hard for students to live in
the Towers.”

An ‘issue which had received
much debate in past meetings. the
new contract for the Pitt News
was quickly voted on and passed.
The new contract will loosen SG
controls on the day-to-day spend-
ing of the paper. The contract also
reduces the risk of ‘intimidation o_f

through the withholding of alloca-
tions. . _ -

out the Ford Foundation and the
Zero Growth Program as the ma-
jor organizations used for this
purpose.

“The Zero Growth conceptis
pure charlatanry,” Marcus assert-
ed. “Right now we have sufficient
technology to solve all of the
problems of population and ma-
terial shortages.

The success of the Zero Growth
movement represents to Marcus
a “triumph of the will” for the
Nixon administration.

“It is an appeal to the simple
life which predicts doom unless
consumption is ‘slowed and re.-
versed,” he said. adding. “it is
directed against those who raise
the level of consumption . . . the
unions.”

Other aspects of our present
society which indicate the suc-
cess of the Nixon program so far.
are. according to Marcus. the de-
cline of radical movements and
the decay of the universities. Fur-
thermore. Marcus believes that
once the Vietnam war is ended the
Nixon administra tion will have re-

Speaking before a capacity au-

Berrigan stressed thatlaws today
are applied with unequal t’orce‘to

groups and individuals in the coun- '

try, and in some cases-"is not ap.-—

of such non-enforcement, ‘accord- _ 
ing to Berrigan is the lack of re- <

 

straint placed on President Nixon _ 

.in his handling of foreignand ‘

domestic matters.

V Berrigan accused Nixon of re- 
fusing to face and deal with prob-  --

lems of housing, school, and med-_
ical care for the poor of this coun-S 9

try, while putting major emphasis ‘ 
and budgetary allowances on war  2

and military preparation.

President Nixon’s - re-election‘ 
was proof, Berrigan feels,‘ that‘:
many citizens accept violence as A

a “good, quick, definitive‘ solu-

tion; that to get rid of hifman be; 1 _ .
ings is the best way to get rid of 

problems.”

But the time has passed, he 

stressed, when the United States
can inflict suffering on others
while feeling none of the pain. He"
claimed that the U.S. can no long-

results.

Berrigan quoted a Rand Corpor- .

resilience and "strength of the sol- I

WAMO Broadcast Adds to Activity

BAS Sponsors Black Market

by KAREN BURGIO

-Thursday’s Black Week activ-
ities included a Black Market Day
in the Student Union Ballroom and
radio station WAMO added to the
hub-bub by broadcasting live from

  
    

- the site.

The Black Market featured busi-
nes"smen with wares from the
black community in a flea mar-
ket atmosphere. People from out-

. side the University were also pre-
 sent, including students from Mc-
. Kelyn Elementary School.

' - Brother Wyatt of radio WAMO

A Day, saying, “This may not be a

financial success but it’s a nice

start and it’s good that Pitt does

something to recognize the black
culture.” WAMO broadcasted live
from the Black Market Day.

It’s great to see the black kids in-

is the discrepancy between the
"paper wealth” and the “real
wealth" in the country.

“What. the capitalists hope to do
is to increase mass profit at the
expense of wages. This is not a
real solution. however. for it re-
duces the demand for goods in
the market.” ' ‘

Marcus said that the capitalists
would try to accomplish this by
means of ’ job rotation, wage
gourging, and productivity drives

which, is nothing else, will bring-

the economy to a “controlled col-

lapse” from which it can be re- I
- built.

“We want to expose productiv-

won’t go along with it. We want to
prevent them from cutting their

To accomplish this, Marcus and
his associates hope to organize ,,a
skeletal force of the “potential or-
ganizers of society.” With this,
they hope to "resist capitalist po-
licies until they are strong enough
to mount a counter-offensive.

“Then we must find a point
where we can gain concessions
and also find out what can be done
with the economic process.” Mar-
cus said.

“The bourgeois democracy will

In other business. a special

to shame the University into mak-
ing improvements in the Union.

A petition was submitted by the
Tenant’s Union "for a referendum
on an optional meal plan. Board
members seemed to think that it
would be best handled by placing
the question on the—SG election
ballot.

Members of the board express-
ed their elation with the results of

said that the trustees now must
realize that further discussion on
the matter would be pointless.

l_aos Key to SE. Asian Peace

there are other problems which
have yet to be con sidered.

Much of Hooley’s talk centered
on Laos, which, according to Hool-
ey, is essential for peace in South-
east Asia. ‘

"If it weren't the presence of
foreign powers." he stated. "the
people of that area would prefer
not to recognize a political entity
called Laos.“ ,

However. Hooley added that
since Laos has a common border
with most of the nations in the
area. if any one nation were to
be granted its territory. the
others would feel threatened.

“If Laos disappears, the peace
disappears,” Hooley concluded.

He also pointed_ to Laos as an
example of the extended family
systems which predominate in
Southeast Asian politics.

“It is these familial conflicts
which underlie the Communist-

Pro-West conflicts of the area.”

Hooley asserted. adding “one of
the problems foreign powers have
faced in their Southeast Asian af-
fairs is that they are not dealing
with a federal government.”

* Hooley added that when such T

family systems exist, their goals
are often in conflict, thus, there
is no unified attack to a problem.
Any coalitions that are formed
vanish quickly. _

Another problem facing Laos
is that of the 300.000 refugees.
roughly 10 per cent of the popula-
tion. .

"With peace they may go back
to the mountain areas or else
squat on the land on which they
are presently living.” Hooley

. said.

He added that relatively little
attention had been given either to
this problem or that of the family
systems, yet both are important
elements of the life of Southeast
Asia. ’

That peace seemed likely was
borne out. according to Hooley. by
the fact that the Laotians them-
selves no longer want to fight,
He added that the only reason
they continue to do so is that they
are ordered to by outside forces.

"The Laotians are used to this

since they were colonized for such
a long time,” Hooley explained.

Regard the economic prob-

lems faced by the Southeast Asian . 

nations, Hooley said that be ex-
pected Japan to be the major con-
tributor to Indochina’s develop-
ment.

“The U.S. will still play a big
role. but distribution will not be

as one sided as in the past,” he - 

said.

the economics of the area—at
least. not for the present.

“China; like the United States./
has never really had a need for

colonies.” he explained. “I think‘

China is more interested in devel-

oping her own raw materials at'- ‘

the present. ”

-, STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE STUDENTS
' AT SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY, NEW ORLEANS CAMPUS,

r " ON SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1972

_,_“The widespread distortion by the news media of the event
surrounding the murder of the two students at Southern University
Baton Rouge campus (SUBR) had prompted the students at the New
Orleans campus to issue the following factual account of the South-
‘ ern,University massacre. ~

This account was taken from testimony by the New Orleans

students who were on Baton Rouge campus at the time 2

.7 At about 4 a.m., Thursday, November 16th. Baton Rouge po-

_ lice arrested four students leaders at their homes on warrants char-
j"ging them with disrupting the normal educational process. Under-
stand that the warrants that were used toarrest the leaders were
dated November 6th, and were supposedly rescinded. At about  o-
'.clock that morning, Baton Rouge students went around to various
 classes at an attempt to get students to boycott. When about 300 stu-
fdents were mobilized, they then went to ask Dr. G.’ Leon Netter-
ville, Pres., Southern Univ., to see about getting the students out
of‘ jail. He told students “Wait right here. I’m going downtown to
’ see about'it now.” Netterville then left under his own power. At

this time, the secretaries, officeworkers, security guards, etc., were

all in‘ the building, coming and going as they pleased. Nothing
 ‘that resembled a take-over was present. About 15 minutes later,

Sheriff’s deputies, National Guardsmen, State Troopers, and city
 -police moved onto the campus and told the students that they had
"Ir two minutes to.leave the building. Reports say that the orders

' could not be heard by the people inside. At the issuance of the

 twominute ultimatum, police began firing tear gas into the build-
’ ing.Students stood their ground and began to throw tear gas back
 at the police. The police then dispersed and came back shooting.
 Two people who were in the crowd with one of the leaders. known
-as “Sabu,” were shot. Police then moved into the building. A fe-
‘,1 male who was sitting down was shot at point blank range with a
{ff "tear gas canister. Her head was split open. Moving the terrorism
E-.‘.voutside, the police spotted a leader named Nate. One of the
lj ~ guardsmen remarked “That’s one ofthe niggers——let’s get him!”
#7 _"Students formed a circle around the particular group of policemen
 and pleaded for the brother’s life. Police then took him behind
 the ‘paddy wagon’ and beat him unmercifully. At the time that this
y‘”"is being written,"his condition remains unknown. Other students
‘*  were beaten and harrassed. Two student leaders are still at large.

The entire massacre was premeditated. Students who were at

;-‘y- the jailhouse attempting to get the student leaders out of jail heard

 ._the sheriff specifically state, before the vamp, “Fm tired of these

 

" ; niggers. We’re going to put an end to this mess today!"

As a result of the incidents on both S.U. campuses, Emitt Doug-
las, President of the Louisiana Chpt. N.A.A.C.P., proposes to seize
 — the moment to institute a merger between the Southern Univ. system
and the Louisiana State Univ. system. The students, faculty. and

\’ .

1- } administrators of the Southern University system passionately re-_

fused such a merger, as it is anoutright demonstration of racist
.7 9 E attitudes toward the black educational system. -

We are calling for a united front of our own against any such

By DENNIS PALUMBO
‘I found my friend Horace,

_ - the political observer, sitting at a
-_ corner table up in The Top of

 s the Towers restaurant last night.

A ‘ lowed my usual boisterous “What’s
" _Happenin’?”; much to my sur-

prise, he raised a finger to his
lips and tilted his head toward

-the wide picture window at his

"7' right, a window which afforded

a- somewhat generous view of the
city.

,“SHHH!” His eyes flashed
deep concern. Feeling properly
chastized, I cautiously pulled a

Wchair up next to him and sat
r . -down.

,“What’s all the’ worry about

 being quiet?” I asked, glancing

‘ ' "around quickly to see that there

 were relatively few other pat-
 , roiis in the room.

"“You’ll wake it up,” Horace
replied, jerking his thumb to-
ward the window. Below the lev-
el_ of his thumb, bright lights

   
   
  
  

' ; twinkled. The city glowed in the

night. ,

Horace began shaking his head.

“It. has remarkable insensiti-
vity,” he said. “I mean, it takes
a noble constitution to be able
to snore soundlessly through
Vietnam, ‘Watergate, pollution,
Defense Department spending. . .”'

“Well,” I offered, “I find
myself that I sleep better on a
full stomach. Maybe if it got hun-
gryit’d——” _

“No good. Just gorged itself
on the big wheat deal. All there
was to do was burp it, change
the sheets, and tuck it back in.”

A waiter strolled by, counting
his tip from another table. I ask-
ed for two gin-and-tonics—doub1es.

“I don’t understand it,” Horace
‘was saying as I turned from the
figure of the retreating waiter.
“Unless those two _fairy tales it
had read to it amounted to any-
thing.”

“Huh?” was all I could man-
age.

‘‘You know, the Trip ‘to Rus-

Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

Mr. Zrust has presented from
time to time, in my opinion,
much garbage. Some of his articles
were good, granted, and they took
much imagination, and skill as
a writer. However, this article
was his all time low. He not only
violated some of the unwritten
rules of journalism, but he also
questioned our rights as Ameri-
cans. A ‘

As a journalist, especially on the
editorial page, it is Mr. Zrust’s
duty to present controversial ma-
terial at times. I guess you can
say that this article accomplished
this goal; since I'm writing this
letter. it did cause some contro-
versy. However, as a journalist
he does not have the right to say
that another person’s opinions and
beliefs are wrong. He can pre-
sent arguments against their side,
and question their beliefs, but he
has no right to come right out
and say, that if you believe one
way you are wrong. A good writer
would never do this. However,
Mr. Zrust does this time and

. -again in his article.

Mr. Zrust supported President
Nixon, a fact‘ that no one can
deny. Anyone who ever read any
article he wrote during the recent
Presidential campaign, which ap-
peared in the Pitt News, could
see this clearly. I supported George
McGovern, along with many
other Pitt students and most of the
Pitt News staff. Now, I am not
attacking Mr.Zrust or anyone else
for supporting Richard Nixon. As
an American this is his right.
Why then didn’t Mr. Zrust give
us the same right?

Throughout his article, Mr.
Zrust attacked anyone who was a

McGovern supporter. Mr Zrust.

presented himself as a baby, who
had to get even with the people
who campaigned for McGovern.
All during the campaign, he said
that he was surrounded by stu-
dents and a news staff who were’
pro-McGovern. Now- he was to
get even. Now he could rub it in.
Now he could tell everybody how
wrong they were for using their
rights as Americans and backing
George McGovern. How wrong
they were for not supporting
Nixon, because he supported Nixon.
He ‘could now rubrit into .peo-
ple. because they did not agree
with him. . ’

The thing that really made me
the maddest, was Mr. Zrust’s
last paragraph:

“In closing, I have no condol-
ences to offer you, but merely
a recommendation. Since George
McGovern’s ideas were right
for you, but wrong for America, _
wrong for the Democrats, and
just plain wrong, do one thing:

It seems to me that Mr. Zrust is
telling all _McGovern supporters
that they were wrong for back-
ing McGovern, and McGovern’s
ideas were wrong. Who can say
if a person is right or wrong in
his political beliefs? An election
does not decide this. As Ameri-
cans we can back whomever
we choose, and even if this can-
didate loses, that doesn’t mean
we were wrong. We backed ‘Mc-
Govern because he stood for what
we believed in, and since our pol-
itical beliefs are our own points
of View, no one can judge them
as right or wrong. Mr. Zrust
stated .that we should “work
WITHOUT the system, for the
good of the country we love so
much.” Once again, Mr. Zrust
seems to be saying that since we
were wrong, that we should stay

‘out of the system for the benefit

of the country. This is not only a
ridiculous statement, but one that
must have come from another
area than Mr. Zrust’s head.
Who is going to say that I -am
wrong because for McGovern,

or that a person is wrong because
he voted for Nixon and vice versa?
Just because a majority of people
voted for Nixon. that does not

say our beliefs for McGovern-

were wrong and that we should-
n't work in the system from
now on. The fact is, we were not
wrong because we backed
McGovern, because McGovern
‘stood for what we believed in.
as Nixon stood for what Mr.
Zrust believed in.

It seems to me, that since Mr.
Zrust heard all through the
campaign about McGovern, and
nobody backed Nixon except him-
self, he was very bitter. So when
McGovern lost, it was Mr. Zrust’s
chance to get even. He present-

ed -himself as an immature per—’

son, whose behavior, or should I
say writing, would be excusable
if he were 4 or 5 years old. How-’
ever, supposedly, a young adult,
he did not present himself as one
in this case. Again, I am not
saying Mr. Zrust was wrong for
voting for Nixon ;- this was his right
to choose Nixon. Maybe Mr.
Zrust should reconsider his state-
ments. and see that as Americans
we all have the right to pick our
own candidate. And whether we
agree or not, no one is really
wrong in their political views and
beliefs.

Dear Sir:

I was grateful for the oppor-
tunity to listen to the speakers
at the anti-abortion rally (whose
attendance counting the four
speakers, Ms. Popp, and myself
came to a grand total of 19) so
that I could better ascertain their
“pro-life” position. For the bene-
fit of the readers of the Pitt News,
I would like to share some com-
ments about the proceedings.

Undoubtedly, most people will
be well familiar with pictures of
the results of abortion as shown
in the movie “Reality of Abor-
tion”. Such pictures are very good
at provoking an emotional response
that tends to dissuade rational dis-
cussion. Much less familiar to
the’ public, however, are pictures
the results of septic abortion that
occur in great numbers when
abortion is restricted. For those

- interested, books are available on

the subject at Falk Libra-ry. It is
too bad that the photographers
who. went to operating rooms so
as to produce “Reality of Abor-

tion” did not also expend some '

footage in the emergency room.
They might have been able -to
obtain some pictures like those in
the medical books. They might
have been able to photograph
uteri that had been removed be-
cause someone had been driven
to such desperation that they put
a plugof soft soap in themselves
in order to induce an abortion.
Or maybe they could get nice,full
color pictures of what happens to
a woman’s insides after some crim-

4 inal abortionist has poked a few

holes in them and infection sets
in. Perhaps they could have gone
to the lab and seen X—rays of
women with catheters in their
abdominal cavities after frantic
abortion attempts have resulted"
in perforation. They could
even have chosen to go to the
morgue and witness the autopsy
of a woman who dies from gas
embolization after septic abor-

V tion. They could have produced

lovely pictures of the red froth
that was once her blood pour from
her heart. Many of these women
do not survive long, enough to
beg male legislators to establish
more humane abortion laws. Those
that do survive are met with Hse
Bill
INSISTS will put an end to abor-

tion. I certainly agree with Dr.

Hogan’s statement that no amount

of semantic gymnastics will ‘change
tbe reality of abortion. 

-when conception begins.

800 which Martin Mullen.

Paul Frances must be forgiven
for connecting __abortion with the
other “anti-life” activities of Hit-
ler, for he does so without-
benefit of having read history
texts. Had he done so, he would
have discovered that Hitler, in an
effort to raise the birth- rate,
repealed the 1925 abortion law and
labeled abortions” . . . acts of
sabotage against Germany's racial
future.” For the same purpose,
he closed every birth c'ontrol
clinic in Germany and banned
the display and advertising of
contraceptives. It is interesting
to note that so much of the liter-
ature of the anti-abortion groups
represented. at the rally con-
cerns itself with raising the- birth
rate. No one will deny the atro-
cities that occurred in Nazi
Germany, but they took place
without abortion.

As for -bills dealing with
euthanasia, I can only say that
if I were suffering ‘from a’ter-
minal illness and were being kept
alive only by needles, tubes and
bottles, I would much rather be
left to die in peace and I do not
want Paul Frances, Martin Mul-
len, the Good Fairy -or-anyone
else telling me differently. ;

The term “right to life” is an
interesting one with many rami-
fications with which the public
should‘ be made aware. Throw
emotion aside for a minute and
consider the implications of
granting constitutional rights from
the moment of conception. When
would legal age begin? To grant
and fully protect rights from con-
ception will necessitate knowing
How
does the state intend to accomp-
lish this? Perhaps by compulsory
examination after each exposure
to‘ a possible pregnancy (and
no birgh control method is 100
percent effective!). If this prov-

 

ed overly cumbersome. then may-,_"_>s_

.be we would have a system of

licensing for sex. A multitude of
other possibilities come readily
to mind. Just where does the
"inalienable" right to life take
precedent over the rights ofthe
rest of us? Such questions are
never asked by those who place
emotion before common sense.

A farmore direct threat to
individual rights and freedoms
arercontained in measures such
as House Bill 800. As passed by
both the House and Senate, the
bill will abolish any termina-
tion of pregnancy except to save
the life of the woman. The Bill
originally stated that pregnancy
would be considered from implan-
tation but it was changed to apply
from conception. The implication
is frightening because many of
the birth control methods in use
today can act as abortifacients.
There is more than enough
evidence to show that intrauter-
ine devices and, to a lesser ex-
tent, birth control pills can
act as abortifacients. I submit that
it is the intention of, Martin
Mullen and the groups opposing
abortion to abolish the use of
IUD’s and oral contraceptives.
Furthermore, in order to enforce
H.B. 800, the state will find- it
necessary to investigate the medi-

cal records of every woman in  ,

state and, if she has an IUD, to
make it compulsory that she have
it removed. Also, any future de-
velopment of morning after pills
will be useless. The use of pros-
taglandins, just introduced in
Europe for public use as morning
after pills, will be curtailed. In
addition to use as an abortifacient,
prostaglandins also may be applied

to heal ulcers, alleviate asthma .

and arthritis, regulate blood pres-
sure and other beneficial uses. Is

. restriction of this drug what we

want from government? After the
state takes control of women’s

wombs what is next? R ‘Johnson .

Is there really a price differ-
ence on similar commidities in
different stores? With this ques-
tion in mind. I set out to compare
prices on randomly selected toil-
etries sold in the immediate Oak-
land area. The stores checked
were the University Pharmacy.
Gil’s (all three of them). Thrift
Drugs. Giant Eagle. Sun Drugs.
and the A&P. One should remem-
ber that these are prices on only

one given day: sales were notin-
cluded.

The toiletries compared were
low in cost. but all were essen-
tials. such that over a year the
money used for them could sub-
stantially add up. In many in-
stances. the college student’s re-
sources are limited. Any savings.
even if it-is only a few cents, can
aid the student in surviving fi-
nancially at college.

As one can see from the charts,

there is definitely a price differ-
entiation among stores in this
area. Consider one example: a
five ounce tube_of Colgate tooth-
paste cost $1.05 at University
Pharmacy. At Gil’s, a 6.75 ounce
tube of the same toothpaste for
37¢ less.

How can University Pharmacy
get away with such atrocious
prices. With the store situated
right next to the University, it is

Teacher Fireci

Over

Homosexuality

WASHINGTON. D. C. — Joseph
Acanfora, III. 22. a classroom
teacher who was transferred to a
nonteaching position after his
homosexual affiliations became
known to school authorities. filed
suit in the U.S. District Court in
Baltimore Tuesday.

Acanfora, an admitted ‘homo-
sexual. is seeking reinstatement
to his classroom position and at-
torney’s fees in his suit against
the Montgomery County Board of
Education and various Montgom-
ery school officials. His suit al-
leges that he was transferred for
"constitutionally impermissible”
reasons. violating his rights under
the 14th Amendment.

After he was graduated last
June from the Pennsylvania State
University, the university certi-
fication council deadlocked on

/

whether he could meet provisions V

of state_ law calling for teachers
to be of “good moral character.”
His appeal to the State Secretary
was successful and he was grant-.
ed credentials.

On Sept. 26. 1972, he was.“te5n-
porarily transferred from his
classroom" -teaching assignment
to a .nonteaching position in the
Montgomery County“Public
Schools’ Department of Curricu-
lum and Instruction. Acanfora has
never been given a hearing and his‘
requests for reinstatement to the
classroom have been refused. ‘

The National Education Asso-
ciation is supporting Acanfora’s
suit. Neither his teaching ability
nor his competence was at issue
in Pennsylvania or Maryland.

A Present Fall Program

gditlon. both groups.

By ANDREW J. SOPKO

Both the Women's Choral and
the Men’s Glee Club have long
formed an important portion of
our University’s choral tradi-
tion. In accordance with that tra-
under the
direction of Mr. Phil Cavanaugh.
performed separately and jointly
in their annual fall concert this
past weekend at Carnegie Music
Hall.

The opening half of the pro-
gram. laden with "mass" orient-
ed material. was devoted to two

A settings of the ordinary by Des

Prez and Britten. Our Glee Club‘s
rendition of Des Prez’s'late me-
dieval polyphony instilled mixed
emotions in this listener. Tenors
and baritones were especially rid-
den with tone problems through-
out; the former displaying an un-
confortable pinched sound in the
higher register and‘ the latter
sounding almost groggy. Convinc-
ing as the first two movements
were, the final two movements
proved less than successful and
were nowhere nearly as polish-
ed. '

Women’s Choral fulfilled their
opening attempt with the Missa
Brevis, of Benjamin Britten, com-
posed in 1959 for the choristers
of Westminster Cathedral. While
our Pitt ladies lack the unadult-
erated tone of. the boyschoir for
which the composition was writ-
ten, they performed this three
part harmonization of the mass
sequence with admirable success.
Sopranos were often screechy,
but the group was otherwise ac-
ceptable. » '

William Goff, whoprocided the
organ accompaniment in the Brit-
ten’, demonstrated knowledgeable
ability at the console. With the
exception of one earlyentrance in

the Kyrie, he conveyed proof of

his musicianship and did his best

By ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

The University Theatre’s cur-
rent production of Bertolt Brecht’s
Three Penny Opera is perhaps
one of the most intricate chal-
lenges undertaken by Pitt’s Thea-
tre Department in the past few
years. It is a difficult show to
stage and to cast and although
it is staged well, there is no cast
in this area to fill the bill with
true justice.

Three Penny Opera is a social
commentary based on John Gay‘s
18th century Beggar’s Opera. It
is a ridicule of the social con-
science of man, and is as appro-
priate today as it was then. The
story revolves around the notor-
ious bandit, Mack and Knife, and
one of his loves, Polly Peachum.

Her father controls the beggars’
market and upon learning of his
daughter’s affair with Mack, de-
cides to get him out of the pic-
ture.

The opera, with songs by Kurt
Weill, is full of wit. humor, and
biting social comment. It is also
full of profanity. The show is
earthy. but it is delivered as if
it were second nature to us all.

Jeff Boudov as Mack gives a
rousing performance and the
most outstanding of the produc-
tion. He is a fine actor and car-
ries with him a very pleasing
voice. This is his first starring
role in a University Theatre pro-
duction and he performs excel-
lently.

.t,‘EMissa's' Music Mutilated  

We must state our admiration
for the attempt made by all of
the artists involved, but we
must also state that the number
of problems throughout the course
of the evening made,the per-
formance unacceptable for even
the most undiscerning audience. ‘

A grave accoustical problem
reigned as one of the primary
culprits of the evening. Calvary
Church in Shadyside, where the
work was performed. is any-
thing but an accoustical gem. And
while we may admire its very
fine English Gothic design. its

very beautiful rood screen (be-’

hind which the orchestra and
choir and massed). serves as a
deterent to any musical attempt.
Sound bounces around the sanc-
tuary area and reaches the aud-
ience in a very muddled state.

Chorally, the Oratorio Society
is not quiteso well off this sea-
son. A very weak tenor section
did its best to bring off their im-

portant moments but very often

failed. especially‘in their sup-
posedly exaltant shout at the
et resurrexit, which came off.
quite understandably, like a cry
for help rather than ‘an announce-
ment of the tidings of the resur-
rection. Other sections of the
choir were passable but no over-
all comment can honestly be
made about balance, as the ac-
coustics make such a ruling most
difficult.

One would like to think that
our soli were ailing on Wednes-
day evening, especially _in view
of their less than inspiring at-
tempts. Marian Kelly, soprano,
Elizabeth Youngue, ‘alto, Tom
Caruso, tenor, and Jerry Shannon,
bass, found it very difficult to
sing together with any semb-

,cluding fugue of

lence of musical sensitivity.
Thoughtful ensemble conditions
within the quartet were fairly

-nonexistent and all singers were

inabsolutely miserable voice. V

The orchestra, about half the
size of the 70 voice chorus, had
anything but a ‘professional’
sound. Woodwinds were absolute-
ly blatant and the brass often
blared rather than played. Be-
cause of the concertmaster’s bad-
ly tuned violin. the lofty strains
of the "Benedictus" never attain-
ed heavenly heights.

As a conductor, Wilkins can
keep things under control admir-
ably. Nonetheless. _he took much
freedom with tempi. The con-
the "Credo"
was mercilessly slow, and per-
haps rightly so. especially in
light of what may have happen-
ed to the chorus had a faster tem-
po been taken. Presto slowed to
aIIe'gretto in the “Agnus Dei” and
excitement waned as a result.

According to the suggestions of.

a famous book of the choral mus-
ic tradition, certain difficult
works should “be attempted-by
good choirs only.” This, of course,
does not necessarily mean to
suggest that the Oratorio Society
is not a good choir, but it does
suggest that the group has per-
haps lost sight of its limitations.

A work on a smaller scale than
that of the Missa may have re-
ceived a ‘better performance. In
the Missa, however, the Society
demonstrated both a lack of fore-
sight as well as a lack of perform-
ance luck. . '

PoetDescribes Black
Struggle in America

By KARL BALDYS

Don L. Lee, a black poet, made a
plea for Black solidarity at a poe-
try reading in the student union
last Friday. The reading was
sponsored by the BAS as a part
of Black Week at Pitt.

The poet began by outlining
the black perspective in America.
He said, “There is no such thing
as objectivity. How can you be
objective about housing when

_you’re on the street? He attacked

the audience for what he called
their failure, as blacks, to be
relevant to the black community.
He stressed Pan-Africanism and
the development of a pure black
culture, attacking the “cultural
nihilism of the 60’s.”

Spaced between major argu-
ments of his speech were his
poems. Lee’s poems described the
city, the streietsand the ghetto.
He asked, “Are you a dead rain-
drop?"

Lee pointed to "western imper-
ialism and its inhuman domina-
tion of the third world." He said.
"Remember. white is the ab-
sence of color . . . When you see
people who are white, know that
they are evil and death is not
far behind."

Lee accused the university
blacks of selling out to a system
of. contrived white oppression.
"Black studies is not ‘pork-chop
studies.” He said that the con-
ciousness of the college student
must paralled the conciousness
of the black community. He cit-

ed Super-Fly and Shaft as misrep-.

resentations of the black man in
America and charged the black
fraternities with ‘romanticizi_ng‘.
He asked the audience, “Are
you committed to a life style that

is diametrically opposed to what
you are?” E‘

Lee praised the Chinese devel-
opment. their cultural autonomy
and their refusal to be fashioned
by Western ideology. "The Chin-
ese people, after 23 years of get-
ting together. can allow. in 1972.
any kind of dirt to come to their

country and not get soiled

tians. — -

If I am incorrect in my assessment of this human desire
in life’s daily dealings, I am still‘ convinced that the feeling
would stand pat in the world of sports.

‘Shove it down their throats’, ‘hit’em’, and ‘kill’em’ are
familiar phrases to the ears of stadium goers. Well, football
wouldn’t be much of a game without it, but I am referring“
particularly to the killing of coaches.

After one season of indirect ‘involvement with the Pitt

football program, I am continually hassled with Carl DePas-
qua’s job. “You should be writing he should be fired,” I am

told. “You are afraid to ask for his job." I am accu_sed. "You V

should do your job.” I am in-
formed.

 

rrf ‘

For some reason, the only
blood I can tolorate is my
own. Bodily injury nauseates
me, and, once I fainted in my
high school bathroom, after
I went in to assist a friend
who-had received a bloody DEPASQUA ,
nose. But, that’s not the reason I am not biting DePasqua’s
hand. I’m just not sure where the fault lies. I

It should be noted that whether I do it or not, the ‘deci-
sion on Carl’s status won’t-be geared around. my writing.
Among the chancelor’s belief, the athletic director’s point of
view, among alumni money, what I have to say won’t matter.

‘DePasqua has been in coaching long enough to know the
rules. He knows that if a coach is successful,_immortality,
glamor, and television commercials are at hand. None of these
are coming so he must have failed.

He has lost a lot of his football players both mentally and
through injury. He has made his share of mistakes. But, if you
believe that c-louds have to form before it storms, you have to
take the Big -Four, overall program, and other intangibles into
consideration.

Should a new coach be hired and the Bg Four not drop-
ped, let it be predicted here that no matter what illustrious
man is hired, four year’s later he will be in the same
boat DePasqua is in now. Of this I am convinced.

If they have not cheated, the other Big Four schools have
taken advantage of all the angles—-alumni giving, recruiting
edges, successful programs. '

Who is to say that if DePasqua had these advantages
all along he couldn’t have done a better job? ‘

It is for these reasons then, not for lack of guts on my‘

part, that I can’t ask for a replacement, in goodfaith.

I would rather be able to look myself in the mirror five
years from now and admit that I‘didn’t have apart in a man
unjustly losing his job, than have made a name for myself.

Yes sir. DePasqua knows what happens to losing football
coaches too. If he is rehired there will be a lot of-dissatisfied
fans, shocked alumni, and Carl himself might be most sur-
prised. But that won’t mean the move was a right one.

Often I have tried to. write about firing/DePasqua. Too
many things have made me look foolish in my attempts, if I
want to be honest with myself.

As far as my nerve is concerned, I would betaking the
easy way out by asking he be fired. I would be popular and
a lot of people would like me a lot more. I think it takes a
job — report-
ing the facts. ’

DePasqua has told me’ numerous times that he would re-
spect whatever I‘ had to say. He cleared the way for me
towrite what everyone wants‘ to hear. But, I ama mere col-
lege student with aminimal knowledge on what makes a foot-
ball coach good, a burning desire to pinpoint the real blame,
and an ego that doesn’t want to be swelled to tremendous pro-

portions.

The crowd has curiously gathered to look at the tragedy
of a 1-9 football season. They are gawking now. And, should
DePasqua get.the axe, a lot of them will undoubtedly say:
“Ah, too bad.”

For me, this lust is replaced by the need to be correct

PSU’s Nittany Lions
Confront Panthers On
Way To Sugar Bowl

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

' Enroute to the Sugar Bowl on January 1, the
Penn State Nittany Lions will tangle with the Pitt
Panthers. The Lions and the Cats will confront
each other at PSU’s Beaver Stadium, this Satur-
dayat1:30 p.m.

Penn State, a winner of three major bowl con-
tests in the last four years, will be looking for a
fourth victory this New Year’s Day when they
battle the Sooners of Oklahoma.

Previous victories for Penn State have been
consecutive Orange Bowl wins in 1969 and 1970and a 30
-6 triumph over Texas in the ’72 Cotton Bowl.

 

A major factor in the Nittany Lions’ contin-
ued success in the ’72 campaign has been the per-
formance of quarterback John Hufnagel.

“Huffy is the best college quarterback in the
country,” stated Penn State’s head’ football coach
Joe Paterno. “He can do it all — run, throw, han-
dle the ball and he is a leader. What more could
you want?” ‘

Apparently, not too much. '

As of the victory over Maryland, Hufnagel held
five Penn‘ State records. It was at that point (still
only the beginning of November that the PSU
quarterbach held the mark in passing yardage in
a game (290), total offense in a game (303), pass-
ing yardage in a career (2,802), total offense in a
career (3,397) and pass completion percentage
in a season (63.2 per cent last season).

“The records are nice because we have had
some great quarterbacks here but I really can’t
enjoy them right now. We still have some games
to play,” related Hufnagel after‘-the Maryland
contest. _

for us.”

back in 1893.

55-18.

“I don’t know if itwas-my best game,” con-
tunied‘ the McKees Rocks native. “But it was
the best passing game we have had as a team.

Thirds Win in Row

by BART MACK

The Penn State lMcKeesporti
hockey team may have surprised
some people this year by winning
their first two games.’ but they
definitely didn‘t scare the Pitt
Hockey Club. Pitt downed Penn
State last night at the Alpine Ice
Chalet by a 9-2 margin.

Penn State did show improve-
ment over last year. when they
did not win a game, and came out
hustling. Pitt received the first
break of the game after only one
minute had elapsed. getting the
man advantage as a result of a
Penn State penalty. From there on
the brother act of Denny and Ker-
ry Browne took over.

Denny picked up a rebound from
Kerry’s shot on goal and. .with
Penn State goalie Marv _Albert
down on the ice. easily lifted the
puck over him for Pitt’s initial
tally. It was a productive night
for the Browne duo. as Denny
picked up the hat trick with Ker-
ry collecting an assist on each
goal.

Rich Baginski scored his first

Trounce PSU  

goal of the season only two min-
utes after the Brownes put Pitt on
the scoreboard. Greg Mintz and
Jeff Leston picked up assists. The
first period ended with Pitt on
top, 2-0.

Penn State looked as if they
were going to give Pitt a tough
battle when they collected a goal
early in the second period. Pitt
netminder Mark Lieberman made
a tremendous save on a break-
away but the rebound went di-
rectly to Bill Chedwick. who bare-
ly beat Lieberman for the goal.
Mintz came right back for Pitt.
scoring only 20 seconds afte
State’s first goal. ‘

The “lush line" came through
again with Phil Clarke lighting the
red lamp. Bill Glanville and Den-
ny Browne set Clarke up for his

-third tally of the campaign. Tom

Lang took a pass from Dave Bahn-
son to score Pitt’s fifth marker
but Penn State came back with
their second goal before the sec-
ond period ended.

Denny Browne opened up the
third period with a goal in the first

and fed, a cross ice pass_ to his
brother.

Bill Glanville took a perfect
pass from the long-haired
Clarke to beat Albert, as Pitt
seemed to be scoring at will. A
minute later Dave Bahnson poked
the rebound of a Frank Williams
shot under the prostrated Albert
to light the red lamp again. Den-

game after Penn State had re-

Pitt's male volle_vball team has
gotten off to a shaky start and is
still actively seeking members.
The team is seeking club status
and thus activities fee funding.
but has not received it as of yet.

The team has just begun to or-
ganize and is looking for students
either with volleyball experience
or just good athletes who are in-
terested in playing.

All male students either with
volleyball experience _or just good
athletes are needed .

All students at Pitt. both
undergraduate and -graduate. are
eligible to join the team. The
women have had a varsity'volley-
ball team for a long time.

The team has had problems I

finding teams to play and has fin-
ally settled into a five team
which consists of Franklin
YMCA, Deer Lakes High School,
Carnegie-Mellon University, and
Slippery Rock College. x,

If the program gets off to a
successful start, the team is
strongly considering entering the
East Coast Collegiate Volleyball

League. "which includes Penn
State, Army. Navy, and Ball
State.

The traveling for that league is
not as much as it would appear
to be. and the regular season
schedule leads up to a tourna-
ment which is held each year at
West Point. ‘

The team is being coached by
Wes Sime,‘ who works in the Hu-
man Energy Department here at
Pitt, and who is amply qualified to
coach a volleyball team, having
competed on a team that came in

. third in the National champion-

ships one year. \

Adams Opfimisfic About Grap Season 

  Volleyball Team
Needs Players

- by BILL PROUDFOOT

The coach and his assistant hustled up the
field house steps and into the hidden cubicle of an
office that fronted as an unused hot dog stand. The

older. but still youngish. Dave Adams slipped into"

his swivel seat and fingered the shiny white adhe-
sive patch covering a cut above his right eyebrow
while his baby-faced assistant. John Abajace. eased
into a padded chair behind me.

Dave Adams is Pitt’s wrestling coach. but on
this particularly chilly Thursday afternoon. he had
been out watching the soccer team battle to a score-
less tie.

“If I want the soccer players to support our
bovs then I have to support them." he grinned.

But our subject was wrestling, and Adams was
obviously enthused about his team’s chances this
year.

“The attitude of these kids is,just great. We‘re
working extremely hard now and we're all helping
each other out.”

Coach Adams is extremely pleased to have one
John Chatman available to start the season. and ex-
pects a great deal from the former Trinity High
star. Chatman. who gave playing part .ime football
to be a full-time wrestler. could.be the best on the
squad. Adams said.

Coach also expects to “get a lot of mileage” if

from fellows like Bryant, Tritch, Morella, and Ca]-
grinini, while he expects freshmen like Ray Dala-
tore and Jeff Minerd “to make it tough for the reg-_
ulars.”

Kevin Love’s ability will be missed. though.
Adams called him "an extremely talented wrestler.
You don‘t find a boy like him every day.”

Is the new freshman eligibility rule good for
college wrestling?

“I think it is a good rule for our sport,” Adams "ii

said. “If a boy is good enough to practice with the
varsity every night, then he should have the oppor-
tunity to compete in the meets.” ‘ ‘ 

, I .. '

The dual meet schedule, which opens Decem-
ber 2 at Michigan. should be very exciting; it in.-
cludes some of the top teams in the East. Power-
houses like Navy and Penn State are slated and
toughies with Michigan. Leghigh, Clarion State.

and Maryland ought to have mat fans drooling in: 3

anticipation.

. Although the dual meets are important. Adams
said that “the tournaments are where you can real-
ly_make a name for yourself. If a boy does some-
thing in the national tournament. he gains country-
wide recognition.”

Women Spikers Beol CMU, Lose Two

by VICKY VETERE

This weekend the women’s var-
sity volleyball team dropped its
record to 4-3. beating CMU. but
losing to Ohio State and Capital.

Last Thursday Pitt romped over

' over CMU by scores of 15-3 and

-15-6. while the B team dropped
both games. 12-15 and 3-15.

The games featured some fine
serving by Pitt. Cathy Cassell of
the varsity team blasted several
fine. deep serves to even up the
scores. ’

Within the first three minutes,
of the first game, one of CMU’s
players suffered an ankle injury

I . and was taken out of the game.

During the second game, both
Cassell
of Pitt completed several power-
ful spikes to CMU. whose players
were making an abundance of
fouls and fumbles at the net.

Manager Eileen Surdoval was
pleased withthe varsity team’s
performance. “They showed good

ball control and serving. and were
able to get in many good hits."-

The A team’s strength was the
B team’s weakness. Both serving
and ball handling were poor. The
women often hit out of bounds
and failed to get the dig on a num-
ber of CMU serves.

Surdoval was rather amazed at
the JV’s double loss. “I still don't
know what happened. CMU really
didn’t win the game on their su-
perior playing. it was on our mis-
takes.”

Saturday’s tri-meet with Ohio
State and Capital held at Ohio
State proved a double disappoint-
ment as Ohio State downed Pitt.
15-6. 15-13. and Capital took the
win 15-6. 15-6. The B team also
lost to both schools. 2-15. 11-15
to Capital-. and 4-15. 9-14 to Ohio
State.

Surdoval commented on the de-
feat. “Both my A and B teams
played well. But Ohio State "and
Capital have better, more exper-
ienced teams. They have been

playing power volleyball for a long
time. My girls just switched this
year, and in a tight situation they
sometimes revert back to their
old habits.”

Even though the women spikers
were up against tough competi-
tion. the facilities at Ohio State
did not help matters any. The
courts were five feet short on
each end. “I wish we had known
we would have to play on a short-
ened court. We could have prac-
ticed that way. Their girls were
used to it. but mine kept hitting
into the back area.

Height was also a factor which
worked against Pitt as both Capi-
tal and Ohio State had many tall-
er women on the team. Both
squads had nice plays with solid
spikes and accurate sets.

Surdoval is confident though.
“It was good experience. I could
have scheduled easy teams for
them to play, but I would rather
they come up against the better
teams so they can improve. Next

year I hope to invite Slippery Rock
and Ohio State to Pitt for a tri-
meet.”

With the season nearing its
close. the women’s volleyball
team still has Indiana and
Youngstown on the schedule. They
will meet Indiana on Wednesday.

President Kennedy described it this way.-

"Acting on our own by ourselves, we can-
not establish justice throughout the world. We
cannot insure its domestic tranquility, or provide
for its common defense or promote its general
welfare, or secure the blessings of liberty to our-
selves and our posterity. But, joined withother
free nations, we can do all of this and more..."

Unfortunately there are people in this coun-
try who are against our simply participating in
the Atlantic Union discussions.

So we need your support.

By filling out and mailing this coupon,you'll
simply be saying “Why not? Let's talk.”

This Atlantic Union Convention will explore
the possibilities of forming a workable federation -
of democracies, geared to finding and imple-
menting practical solutions to our mutual
troubles.

By utilizing the individual strengths and
talents of each free nation, we can begin to set
things straight on the only world we've got.

We can pull the peoples of the world togeth-
er by solving the difficulties we face together.

The concept of a federation of autonomous
democracies is not new. Beginning in 1939 with
Clarence K. Streit’s non-fiction best-seller, Union
Now, it has won the support of such divers

There's only one answer:

We're all on this thing together.
, Even if we don't get along with some na-
tions, we've got to deal with the great problems
thataffectall nations: not Martians but pollution,
population, trade barriers, restricted freedoms
to travel, war.

They're just too big and too urgent for even
the strongest nations to solve alone.

One way to develop solutions is by getting
together with nations we are friendly with...
some of our European allies and other autono-
mous democracies.

In the next session of Congress, a resolution

 

will be introduced calling for a convention of del-
egates from the most experienced democracies.
