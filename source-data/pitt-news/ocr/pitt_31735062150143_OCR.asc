Miss Doehla cited exainplcs. -of

dcnt"s. “st:1b-E11-the-back" -.-rpcech di-
re:-ctcd 21,9j.1lll.=.t Italy a short wlrlle
back. She stated the presldert was
“yelling-' loudly and l31“an(lisl'1'i11g :1

.l\/1.1.35 Doehla was i‘ollo\\‘ed by Z'is-
kind. xv’.-to argued, “What about
child labor rclorms, unemployment
111511111111;-e, old age compensations‘?”
“If. their co:1t'i:1u._z-itiion .means cen-
tralization, th-en by all means, 1et’s

He also scored various groups sup-
porting‘ the Republican candidate,
say‘ir1'g, “I do not say that all Will-
k1'e's supporters are un-American,
‘but I do say that every un-Ameri-
can 'ini’luenree ‘in Ainerica is in sup-
port of Wendell Wil1kie.”

Handling the afﬁrmative rebuttal,
Roth ag-a‘i:1 pointed out that Roose-
ve1t"s .1d~ini'nist.rati()n was leading
the country ‘into war. The presi-
-c‘.ent"s-,appointment of Henry Stim-
son as ‘secretary of war, ‘a political.
move "at best, and his action in
the recent “destroyer deal” could
vccrtninly not be termed projects of
peace, ‘according to Roth.

Pitt Town meeting will be contin-
ued the Monday after the Armistice

The Pit: News

bill patrick"’s I--III-'--I
aﬁzlza

I’ve discovered—and probably you have by ‘no\‘\'——
that the hall’ of your life that everybody tells you YOU
missed is the Schenley theater, marqueed as the Show-
place of Oakland, on Saturday afternoons.

Even with the pence—l'or—dei'ense included and add-
ed, they give you plenty for your money at one of those
Saturday matinees.

Saturday afternoons,
you see, are given over to high-class grade B horse
operas and the super—special series dealing with the S0-
cial structure of modern life,
often: the Bell telephone; the
ditional thrill of these yeah-
dat’s - what - youse — tink kids,
the Dead Enders. And say,
whatdyousetink‘? Those tough
Dead End kids have gone and
joined up with them Junior
G-men in, order to apprehend
(it said) the Torch Gang, too.
My, it's certny grand.
But the horse opera!
It was one of those standard
‘American epics 8b011t l31‘08-
ress_ and , trailblazing and
America. They’ve been trot-
ting out those things every so
ofen: the Bell telephone; the
1_~ailroa_ds;, the Pony Express,
and the one .-about Slabfoot,
. the Susquehannock who cut a ’
swell trail from Pine Junction _
up Clark Valley. (This is a
new release with special ap-

peal to the Park Avenue
crowd.)
Anyhow, the one at the

Schenley was called the Tele— — V ~ V ‘
graph Trail. And what a trail. They mowed down
tribe after tribe of vicious Indians who were misled by
a vicious white man. They kept blazing away With
riﬂes and six-shooters. And the Schenley was full of
kids . The hotter the gunﬁre got, the wilder those kids
got.

And when things

looked bad for the Telegraph Trailers——them Indians
just about had ’eni 1icked——t‘ne kids were half standing
and half sitting, all of ’em yowling for the Telegraph
Trailers. And then John Wayne came ricliﬂg 7~ll3—*di5'
guised as an Indian (on account of he wanted to fool
the Indians one of the kids explained to me after-

wards). He c'.nne riding up, cloppity C109. -’33‘~‘~l3Di'if.‘>'
clop. The guns were spitting and the arrows were

zinging. He came riding up cloppity clop. And the
whole seventh and eighth rows of the Schenley began
swaying and rising up and down to the sound of the
hool's, cloppity—-rise~clop-—fall. The Sclienley was a
mad house. And I can say that if them Telegraph 'l idli-
ers hadn’t won, and the Union Army——yes, they were
in too--‘nadn’t arrived five hundred abreast across a
mesa, there wouldn’t be any Schenley, the Slim“-A,i'l.)l.ilC‘€ of
Oakland. Those kids would have seen to tli-at.

Postscript to Election

l i i _ Gerald Ziskiiitl

No thinking person doubts the oft-repeated prin-
ciple that democratic government. depends on a tree,
untrammelled press. We know, for example. that the
first act of an aspiring dictator is to muzzle the -.nev.'s;
utilizing the p:.ess as a ‘high—powered iinstrument to
drown out the opposition, the usurper can tliercbf im-
pose his brand of tyranny in the name of “j=.1stice."
A ‘free press, we all agree, is a mighty bul'w:~xrk ‘tor a

_ A free people.

The Press Is Not Free
.And yet, as the recent political canipaign served
to indicate, the American press is not free. Under the

_pressure_ot' events, it became as rutbl_ess, as arrogjant.
and unscrupulous as the dictated: press of Europe. It ..

was almost wholly one-sided. It resorted -to the
familiar tricks of Goebbel’s propaganda 1n”inlstI'}’.~ sup-
pressing or de—emphasizing news in order to serve the
selﬁsh interests of its overlords.

I write this column before the victorious presiden-
tial candidate is known. But if, by the time you read
this article, President Roosevelt should be the winner,
it would serve as striking evidence that the honest
facts, sincerely interpreted and disseminated via radio,
can rise phoenix-like to overcome the tremendous ob-
stacle of a dictatorial press.

License, Not Liberty

When I refer to a free press, I do not mean a
free editorial policy. The publishers and business cor-
porations controlling the editorial columns are cer-
tainly entitled to denounce Roosevelt with urrestrained
fervor, for that is a recognized right of free expression
in America. But when the press deliberately .isre-
gards the messages, and addresses of the President.
either by not printing them at all, or, burying tlieni
obscurely among the obituaries, the press of America
is not fulfilling its 1"unct.ion as impartial purveyor of
facts. When the press devotes its entire headline space
to ballyliooing the exploits of Mr. Willkie, and forgets
to mention the cause of President Roosevelt, even upon
his delivery of a major campaign speech, then the
American press is not truly free.

Return To Ethics

What this means, of course. is that the American
press has gravely compromised its sense of social re-
sponsibility. Ethics are blithely sacriﬁced when there
is no strict social accountability. Publishers hell—bent
on electing the utility candidate were willing to per-
vert their news columns with over-emphasis and repe-
tition, seeking to convey a one-sided notion of the
facts. Distorting news emphasis is a perilous abuse of
privilege. This triﬂing with the techniques of Euro-
pean distatorships must cease if America is to remain
free. Now that the acrimony of the campaign is over,
I pray that the American press will re-afﬁrm its lofty
principles of fairness, ;impartiality,_. and social respon-
sibility. if only because penance, as they say, is good
for the soul.

i To the Editor

Editor, the Pitt News:

I think the peopleol’ this country
are be:-o1’nin.g unduly alarmed over
the danger of agression by some
tforeign power. _ 

Our potential enemies are Japan,
Germany, Italy, and the Brlti=sh
Fleet.

Our Paciﬁc ﬂeet, ﬁghting a de-
fensive war,  far more than a
match for Japan, and could un-
senol 'reint’orcements‘- ‘to
the Atlantic. There we would have
our Atlantic squadron,‘ a stepcl'iild
to be sure, but still composed of
‘I25 vessels of all types, and backed
by the best naval aircraft in the

‘ world.

We _would be attacked by what
was left of the French,_ Italian,
British, and -German navies, which,
let us say, outnumber the Atlantic
squadron three to one. When they
came within 500 miles of our coast,
or rnorelikely, the Caribbean, we
should do exactly as the: Italian
navy is doing: stay in home ports
and harass the invader with mines,
submarines, and airplanes.

The ﬁve hundred airpl.anes which
the enemy could bring in car"iers
would be an easy mark for our air-
lforce, small as it is. When the
enemy would grow tired of keeping
its vessels in the open sea, they
would retire, and we would once
more control our side of the At-
lantic.

As for invasion in force. let me
cite one illustration: the Germans
have been laboring manfully for
more than two months to  across
twenty miles of English channel.
Let’s enlarge our navy some: Let’s
enlarge our airforce more and mod-
ernize our army: but let’s not lose
our heads.

ARTHUR MANKIN, C42 1-41.

Editor’s nolie: * Vl=i7:ell., now that
war’s all settled, let’s sit back and
enjoy the present one.

Panther C1‘OSS~C011l1l1‘y Sqiiad
Seeks Revenge over Penn State

Pitt and Penn State stage their
annual cross country feud at Schen-
ley park. this Saturday. For either
team, victory in this contest is tan-
tamount to a highly successful sea-
son, for bitter rivalry «exists between
coaches Olson and Werner.

Pitt will again bank on co—capt:iin
Walt Sterner, stellar veteran of the
squad. The margin of victory for
Sterner, if any, is not expected to
be so wide as has been the case in
previous meets. however.

For the number two slot for the
Panthers’ coach Olson will probably
bank on Frank -McCabe. Slow in
starting this year, lVIcCabe should
still be a deciding factor in the Pitt-
Penn State outcome. Sophomore
sensation Marcus Allias and junior
Johnny Brosky will be the other
Pittstzers upon whom much will de-
pend. .

The Staters, led by captain Willy
Smith, will provide the Olson l1:;11'-

riers with plenty of real competition.
State will be out to duplicate their
outst:1n.din;~;‘ win of last year when
they meet the Panthers here Satur-
day. The victory over the Blue a‘z‘.d
Gold aijhletes last season was the
only win garnered by the Lions.

The Slippery Reel: meet, original-

held yesterday over the Schenley

Golden Bears,
C hcrokces Play
Again after Tie

This fa1l’s intramural sports
schedule should take the prize for
being novel if nothing else as for
the second time this football season
two teams are scheduled for a re-
match. This may not seem odd to
the average observer, but under the
double elimination system, it rare-
ly occurs.

A 6-6 tie in last lVlonday’s game
between two stubborn foes, the
Cherokees and the Golden Bears.
necessitates a replay of that contest
today at 4 o’clock on ﬁeld 2. The
game will "be, without a doubt, the
most thrilling and hard fought of
the day for elimination will be the
fate of the loser. '

The tie was marked by hard line
play as well as frequent pass inter-
ceptions. Primer, Golden Bear
stalwart, made the first touchdown",
only to be followeda few minutes
later by Wilson of the Cherokees
going over. A" " A

With possible elimination from
the I-F race facing both teams, the

outscored a valiant Sigma Alpha
Epsilon team Monday, 26-18.

Sigma Chi’s Kline had a hand in
every one of his team’s points. He
threw two touchdown passes, to
Coxey and one each to Foliart and
Donaldson. He drop-kicked one
extra point and tossed to Roberts
for the other.

One of Kline’s passes went astray
and was picked out of the air by
Richmond, who dashed 30 yards for
the score. Jack Creps caught two
of Penman’s passes in the end zone
for the last SAE scores.

“Lzmky Red” Silverman led his
Sigma Alpha Mu boys to a 7-0 vic-
tory over the Pi Lambda Phi team
in a game which eliminated the
loser.

The lone tally came in the open-
ing minutes, when Red threw to
Aaron over the goal line. Lefty
Mayer tossed to Aaron for the con-
version. The biggest disappoint-
ment of the afternoon was the pass-
ing of Larry Katz. He completed
only one pass to Kreimer, while" six
of his passes were intercepted.

Observer Predicts Early
Action by SFA to Clear

Dance Chairman  Mixap

Group Expected to F ind Remedy
A For Leakage of ‘Secret’ Details

By S. F.

Ayers

While everyone on the appointments and executive committees of
the Student-Faculty association is fervently denying there will be any
changes in the dance chairman setup at the University, it is obvious to
most campus observers that something will be done to remedy the faults
discovered in selection of freshman and sophomore dance heads.

Main cause for complaint in the
of information which seeped out
from the supposedly-secret meet-
ings of the appointments committee.
The secrecy surrounding the activi-
ties of the committee is a newly-
adopted attitude. In former years.
the committee released to the stu-
dent body the names of men recom-
mended for dance positions tovthe
executive committee. This year the
entire procedure has been veiled in
mystery—ofﬁciall.y.

Instead of having the entire cam-
pus know, through public announce-
ment of the committee, that So-
and.so, Soandso, and Soandso were
recommended as candidates for
chairman of the freslnnan dance by
the appointments committee, the en-
tire campus was informed, through
private disclosures of committee
members, that certain names were
suggested to executive committee
for certain dan_ce.pg_sitio2.1s. ’ '

pointments chairman Roger Powell,
E41, this practice of divulging to
friends and fraternity brothers the
names and details of recommenda-
tions has been claimed by appoint-
ments committee members to be a
natural practice of many years
standing.

It was rumored by many campus
big-wigs that the executive com-

Confirmation

‘What was campus gossip for two
weeks was formalized Monday aft-
-ernoon when Lee McFadden, C44,
and Joe Mash, C44, received oili-
cial. notiﬁcation of their appoint-
ments as business manager and
publicity director, respectively, of
the Freshman dance. The appoint-
ments were made by Howard Wil-
son, C44, named chairman last
week by the SFA executive com-
mittee.

Thus Wilson has done what the
executive committee was «expected
to do and didn’t.

mittee did not exactly approve of

the undercover methods adopted by _
this year's“ appointments group.

None in the know will admit that

anything is being done to change

the appointments system, but sev-

eral members of the executive

committee have intimated that

“things will be handled differently

from now on.”

The following‘ is rumored to be
the proposed setup for future dance
appointments: .

1. Candidates will be interviewed.
by the appointments committee all
on the same day, if possible, to avoid
any “tip-oﬁs.”

2. Appointments committee will
send three or more recommenda-
tions to the executive committee,
at the same time releasing the
names of the recommended candi-
dates to the student body.

Pitt Gets Portrait f Paderowski

Commemorating the cightieth
biithdav of Ignace Jan Paderewsli
world famous pianist-statesman, the
Polish nationality room committee
will present. a portrait of their noted
countryman to the University to-
morrow at 11:30 o’clock in the de-
partment of music appreciation.

The portrait, done in oils on a
black background, was painted by
Mrs. Lucille Tomei, Pittsburgh
artist. Mrs. Tomei, whose works
have been widely exhibited through-
out the Middle West, is now the or-
ganizer for National Art week, to
be held this month.

Theodore M. Finney, associate
professor of the department of music
appreciation, will accept the por-
trait. on behalf of the University.
Heliodor Sztakr, Polish consul gen-
eral in Pittsburgh, will be the prin-
cipal speaker at the presentation,
discussing “Paderewski as 21 lV[usi-
cian and a Statesman.”

The consul general will enumer-
ate to his listeners the events of
the pianist—."tatesma1'r‘s life, all of
which have been shaped by his
“two passionate loves; love of his
country and love of his art.”

In 1919 Paderewski assumed the
prin".e-ministry of war-torn. Coin-
munist-threatened Poland, and did
much to obtain the creation of the
thirteenth point in President Wil-
son’s peace plan, “Polish independ-
ence, guaranteed by a covenant of
nations.”

A few months later he resigned

Card~P1mching. ~Machinesr in ~Registrar’s Office

By Neal X. Russo

Do you know how many unmar-
ried male Methodists attend the
University from Butler county and
how many of these same Methodists
were born in 1920? graduated in
the first ﬁfth of their high school
class in 1938? and are now ﬁrst-se-
mester juniors in the pre-medical
division of the College‘?

They can tell you all that, and a
lot more, up on the e.igliteentl1 floor
if you’d just give them a few min-
utes.

University graduates do get jobs
—-with remuneration.

They even get promotions!

This was revealed when two for-
mer Pitt students, Alvin‘ Malakoff
and Abe Wolovitz,_ were advanced
from jobs with the census bureau
in the department of commerce to
positions with the civil service com-
mission at Cincinnati, and the
Frankfort Arsenal, at Philadelphia,
respectively.

Both boys moved into their posts
with the census bureau immedi-
ately upon graduation from the
government service division of the
University last June. Malakoff was
managing editor of the Pitt‘New.s
in his senior year, and Wolovitz
served as manager of Men’s Debat-
ing association. Both were mem-
bers of the Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on Government. Malakoﬂf was
also a prominent worker in Peace
council. which operated on campus
until this year.

statistical (-arcl whose 45 columns
of code numbers take in everything
from year of birth to college grad-

such. as -fraternity, race, mothcr‘s
birthday.

Key to the statistical setup is the
assigning of a code number to each
of a group of relevant details. For
instance-, under the “county” col-
umn, No. 1 might mean “Allegheny,”
No.  might indicate “Washington,”
and so on. Then the number of

his Paris debut with a very suc-
