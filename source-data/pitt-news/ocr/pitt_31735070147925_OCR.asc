Choirs sing for Lupusresearch

Shaé Felicien
Staff Writer

The Drug Called Charlie Sheen made
an on— campus appearance Saturday

night, but it didn’t care about win-

ning. Instead, the four—man band

used its rock—infused sound to raise .

money for lupus research.
The band was one of 12 singing
acts to participate in Saturday night’s

A Voices For a Cure: A Fundraiser for

Lupus Research, which was orga-

. nized by Rocky. Paterra, who is a

member of Pitt Pendulums, one of
Pitt’s a cappella groups. p
Held in the Public Health au-
ditorium in Parran Hall, the event
drew in a crowd of more than 200

attendees who raised nearly $2,000 _

for the Lupus Center of Excellence
of -the West Penn Allegheny Health
System. “

The center works toward advanc-
ing research of autoimmune diseases
and improving the quality of life of

those afflicted by them. Lupus is a

disease where the immune system
attacks healthy cells and tissues,
leading to chronic inﬂammation.

Paterra, afreshman at Pitt, dedi— ‘

cated the event to the memory of
his best friend’s father, Jerry Wayne
Summers, who died in 2009 after a

_ 10-year battle with Lupus. He was

54. -
In a pamphlet distributed dur-
ing the event, organizers described

. Summers as a loving husband and

father, who was also a radio broad-
caster in Miami and Buffalo, 

p “Their family has been so incred-
ibly strong, and they’re so giving to
their community. Just being a part
of their life made me want to give
back,’.’ Paterra said.

. Paterra ﬁrst enlisted the help of
his own a cappella group, the Pitt
Pendulums, in November before
contacting other groups around
campus to perform. He said they
seemed eager to participate in the
cause.

cuts
trigger
protest

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

People from blocks around could
hear the shouts and cheers of more

V than 400 people protesting Port Au-

thority service cuts in Squirrel Hill
Saturday afternoon. l ‘
With little more than aweek to go
before the cuts take effect, protest-
ers sought to change policymakers’
minds about reducing service by 15
percent because of a lack of ﬁmding.
The impendingcuts brought together

- organizations representingstudents,

. Amalgamated Transit Union

' Local 85', which represents Port

Authority bus‘drive'rs, helped or-
ganize the permitted protest along
with Pittsburghers for Public Transit.
Pitt senior Andrew Wagner, ahistory
and political science major, helped
organize and publicize the protest
as a part of Pittsburghers for Public
Transit. '

Wagner, a member of Pitt’s Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society group,
created the Facebook event for the
protest. ‘

“We want to show the policymak-
ers that we are not goingto stand for
cuts to public transit,” he said. “In
fact, we demand that there is an im-
provement in public transit. We really
think that the city depends on it.”

Students acrossstate ﬁght Corbett’s proposed cuts

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Three weeks ago, Pitt senior Nick
Brink didn’t picture himself be-
coming the leader of a state—wide
student organization.

The neuroscience major is now
the acting president of the Coali-
tion of Pennsylvania Students, an
organization founded after Gov.
Tom Corbett proposed halving state
spending on Pitt and other Penn-

 

sylvania universities in his budget
address two weeks ago.

Brink and the 11 members of the
group’s board — which is comprised
of students throughout the state —
are trying to bridge a gap between
various universities in the two state-
supported systems: the four state-
related universities and the 14 uni-
versities in the Pennsylvania State
System of Higher Education.

“There was not one organization
that wanted to coordinate with all
schools,” he said. “We’ve worked

nonstop over spring break to get all
of the organization started.”

He created a Facebook event-

hours after Corbett’s budget address
two weeks ago, “GOV CORBETT
50% Appropriation Reduction for
Higher Education— UNACC_EPT-
ABLE” that now has more than
22,000 attendees. '

The cuts, part of Gov. Tom Cor-
bett’s ﬁrstbudget, amount to almost
$900 million in education spending
and would reduce Pitt’s $185 million
appropriation by more than half,

to $80.2 million. State legislators
will hold hearings on the budget
throughout April before setting a
date to vote on it. 4

Accounting for inﬂation, the ap-
propriation —.which accounted for
9 percent of Pitt’s budget this year
— would be the smallest Pitt has re-
ceived since becoming state-related
in the 1960s. Pittwill also lose more
than $10 million in federal funds
this coming year. Its total budget
is more than $1.9 billion.

Corbett called his $27.3 billion,

long-established and more recently
formed student organizations
across the state.

Brink has also worked to promote .

GPSA’s online petition against the
cuts —— which by Friday had more
than 4,000 signatures from stu-
dents at more than two dozen uni-
versities across the state.

Devanath also emphasized the
importance of Pitt Day in Harris-
burg on April 5. Student Govern-
ment Board will bus students to the
capitol building for a day of lobby-
ing legislators in person.

“We want to ﬁll as many buses
as we can,” she said. “When you
are talking to that legislator or that
staffer face-to-face, it’s hard to be
ignored by them.”

Other student leaders have fo-
cused most of their advocacy on
their campuses, or coordinated
through the Pennsylvania Associa-
tion of State—Related Students, an

organization formed last semester ~

to support public funding for Pitt,
Penn State University, Temple Uni-
versity and Lincoln University.
“There’s no need to re—invent
the wheel here,” said Christian Rag-

land, the president of Penn State’s
University Park Undergraduate
Association, referring to the new
coalition.

“I admire [Brink’s] efforts and I
hope to continue to help him in the
future,” he said. “But we need to get
behind the organizations that are
already established.”

The efforts of the state’s most
populous campus — with more than
40,000 students — have focused on
getting stories out to legislators. In
the last week, Penn State has gath-
ered video stories from students on
its campus, and Ragland said UPUA
wants to organize a phone bank to
reach out to legislators in the next
few weeks.

The phone bank is similar to a
letter writing campaign on Pitt’s
campus sponsored by SGB and
GPSA that kicks off tomorrow. De-
vanath said that Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg is scheduled to speak at
6 p.m. to start the campaign, which
runs through Wednesday.

The two groups will also coordi-
nate district lobby visits and calling
days.

But SGB President Molly Stieber
said the biggest event will be a rally
on March 30. Although details about
the location have yet to be ﬁnalized,
Stieber said she was “in talks” with

’ city administration to possibly shut
down Bigelow Boulevard and hold
the rally there. -

Timed less than a week before
Pitt’s Day in Harrisburg, the rally
would not be an SGB event. Stieber
said she wanted it to be “student-
driven‘, student—led.”

Pitt students will go to Harris-
burg the same day as Penn State’s

students, although Ragland said ,

that the two schools did not coordi-
nate the event. He thinks that reach-
ing out to legislators — especially
this year — will be the best way for
students to enact change.

“Students didn’t really under-
stand the importance of days like
that until this year,” he said. “I think
that the protest, the activism, plays
a deﬁned role in this process, but it
is up to the legislators to vote.”

Avenue to oppose the cuts independent from
any of the organizations.

“I’ve neverbeen to something like this,” she
said, raising her voice to be heard above the
crowd. “I don’t know much about this part of
the Pittsburgh economy, but as Pitt students,

we’re paying for it.”

Students on Pitt’s Oakland campus receive
Port Authority rides as part of their $9o—per-
semester Safety, Security and Transportation
Fee.

Wagner said that, as a Pitt student living in
Friendship, he relies a lot on Port Authority

,_ service.

“Without the 54C, I’d be late for class a lot,”
he said.

Leading up to the start of the march at noon,
drivers honked horns and the crowd cheered
whenever a passenger exited a Port Authority
bus, until police shut down trafﬁc on Murray
Avenue and the protesters stepped off the side-
walks at Beacon Street to begin their march
northward.

Police prohibited parkingon Murray Avenue
from noon to 2 p.m. for the protesters, who
marched from Beacon Street to the intersection
of Forbes and Murray avenues.

The crowd piled onto the lawn and steps of
the Sixth Presbyterian Church at Forbes and

Murray avenues about 12:30 p.m. for the rally.

Some of the crowd spilled onto the sidewalk.-
Speakers decried the Port Authority’s
planned March 27 cuts, which would reduce
service by 15 percent across the county. It would
also eliminate 29 routes entirely and reduce

. service onanumber of others, includingthe 71A,

C and D routes that run through Oakland. At
times, the speakers were drowned out by chants
of “Stop the cuts” for up to half a minute.

The cuts came after $45 million in federal
funds directed by former Gov. Ed Rendell were
meant to prevent service cuts of about 30 per-
cent. The Port Authority’s Board of Trustees
approved the smaller, 15 percent cuts in]anu—
ary —- partially because of a lack of dedicated
ﬁmding.

The rally on the church lawn petered out
after 1 p.m. when speakers turned off the bull-
hom after a promise that they would continue
protesting at Friday’s Port Authority Board

' meeting Downtown.

Mark Cheran, a Virginia native, said that
he hadn’t heard of the protest before he pulled

Authority often when in college.

protest went by, he had a different problem.

Pitt announced on Friday that itwould require its

the advice of the U.S. Department of State.

Neither Whitehead nor the students could be
reached for comment Sundayto see iftheyhadall

students currently injapan to depart by the end
of Saturday.

Pitt also canceled trips for six Pitt students
who were preparedto leave for the country inthe
next few weeks.

Students prepared to leave forjapan in the

NCAA blues and

blame

hen high expectations
Ware vanquished in a
sudden cloud of shock

and dismay, people respond by
grasping desperately for silver
linings, doing their best to sus-
tain any unextinguished morsels
of self-esteem.

We at The Pitt News tried that
for about an hour. But after the
men’s basketball team’s loss to
the Butler Bulldogs on Saturday,
little solace can be found for our
troubled hearts.

Oh sure, as the NCAA Tourna-
ment hums along Panther-less,
people will try to comfort Pitt
fans. They might applaud our
regular-season record, using
words like “remarkable” or the
all-American “awesome-sauce.”
They might point out how quickly

. we can replace graduating seniors

with incoming talent. Or they
might talk about the good looks
of Pitt fans as a whole. Although
all of that is true, we think Satur-
day’s defeat grants Pitt students
a free pass to be utterly, immuta-
bly sad — for at least a few more
days.

Along with a generalized sen-
timent of gloom, the blame game
abounds on campus. Fingers are
pointing every which way, from
last-minute referee calls tojamie
Dixon’s decision not to call enough
timeouts or pull the players from
the line during Butler’s end-of-
game free throws. Whereas some
arguments might now seem to
have merit, sifting through the
complexity of the loss to ﬁnd cau-
sality — especially when biased
by an abnormal—to —the-point—of—
unhealthy emotional state —— is a
practice ripe for error. So at least
in this editorial, we’ll refrain.

But that doesn’t stop us from
offering season—wide reflection.

In one stroke of analytical ge-
nius, we’ve discovered that the
two highest-proﬁle men’s sports

— teams —— basketball and football

-— might suffer from a kind of

“big-game mentality.” Whereas -

it became clear last year that
men’s football somehow fails to
win big regular—season games"
— ahem, Backyard Brawl 2010

-_ — the basketball team might

often knock off socks during the
regular season, but it just as con-
sistently disappoints come the
NCAA Tournament. A phenom-
enal characteristic ofjamie Dixon
is that he gets the Panthers to the
top of the Big East each year, but
for some reason the performance
stops there. '

But why? Why must the cur-
tains fall so prematurely? Why
can’t Pitt translate national rank-
ings into sizeable, deserved post-
season triumph?

Some say Pitt has choked each
year because each victorious op-
ponent has managed to put on the
court an unstoppable. player that
Pitt cannot seem to neutralize.
Think of Scottie Reynolds from
Villanova,]ordan Crawford from
Xavier or Shelvin Mack from this
year’s Butler team. Somehow
the Panthers let Mack score 30
points Saturday. Or perhaps the
Panthers engage. in yearly Tour-
nament— choking because the Big
East affords a uniform style of
play that tends to differ from
the playing styles of their NCAA
Tournament opponents.

Or perhaps it’s just another
fluke that shouldn’t change the
way we live our lives, as any bas-
ketball game — no matter how
many brackets you fill out or of-
ﬁce pools you participate in — is
in the end just a game. Nah, let’s
go with the being-sad thing. .

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Charlie Sheen needs help. No, really

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Human beings have an astonishing
tendency to concern themselves with
otherpeople’s business. Fromthe nosy
neighbors of ﬁction and reality to the
endless game of espionage played by
governments and corporations, we
demonstrate our intense interest in
the lives and actions of others, even in
caseswhenthose actionsare irrelevant
tous. UnlessIhappentobea'IVexecu—
tive or one ofhis ex-wives, the actions
of Charlie Sheen don’t matter in my
day-to-day life. Yet why are a record
number of people clingingto his every
brain dropping on Twitter, andwhyis
he able to parlay his role from “Two
andaHalfMen” into aseries of appear-
ances ontalkshows and maybe evena
/talk show ofhis own?

Althoughlhave no interestin oruse
for People, Us, Them, You-All, Aliens
or Celebrity Bass Fishing Weekly, I do
have a few theories as to why celebri-
ties, pardcularly self-destructive ones
like Sheen, command such afollowing.
For onething,the average human lifeis

pretty boring. We get up, eat breakfast,
go to work, discuss bass ﬁshing, come
home, eat and go to bed. Much as we
enjoy the idea of some excitement to
break this monotonous routine, the

vastmajorityofuswouldpreferittobe’ '

a safe and predictable form of excite-

. ment. And safe excitement is rather

difﬁcultto accomplish, unless we enjoy

very simple plots that are easy to fol-
low. Chaos in Libya has many elements,
from the domino effect triggered by
protests in Tunisia and Egypt to the
corrupt 42-year reign of Muammar

the conﬂict, and its outcome is uncer-
tain. Not only that, there are so many

the most destructive kind of celebrity
stories. We see a rich and famous per-
son looklike afool or have a meteoric
fall and it makes us feel better about
ourselves. Although we don’t have the
wealth and fame, we ﬁnd comfort in

havingadollop of common sense. We _

can by some measure judge ourselves
superior to those who have debilita —
ing addictions along with fame and
fortune. Andthe more arrogant or self-
assured the celebrity, the more enjoy-
able it is to see him fall. Iwould wager

thatif,say,OprahW'mﬁ'eyweretostart

— behaving like Sheen, we wouldn’t see
either as much coverage or as much V

glee at that sort ofbehavior. ‘

Of course, whetherwe shouldcare
is another matter entirely I’m inclined
tothinkthatwe shouldbecausethefact
that Sheen’s antics have found a will-

Charlie Sheen needs. The only differ-
ence between the two people is that
one isfamous andthe otherisnot. This
disturbing duality suggests that those
who are famous forfeit aspects of hu-
man dignity by virtue of their fame.
This dualitywouldbe less worrying
if at least the public were learning the
right lesson. It is not. Rather, the public
is being led to the conclusion that er-
ratic behavior is amusing. The lesson

on Forbes needs help, whereas there

EVENT PREVIEW

Emma Kilcup
For The Pitt News

An Evening with Brittany
Snow

William Pitt Union Assembly
Room

Today, 8:30 to 11:30 p.m., doors
open at 8 p.m.

Tickets free for students with

ID

More than 31,000 people liked
the “Love is Louder” Facebook
page, and they’Ve posted a com—
bined 1,000 pictures. These pho-
tographs are by people young and
old, men and women, famous and
not famous, with the words “Love
is Louder” displayed on hands,
paper hearts and even a baby’s
onesie.

The campaign began in Sep-
tember, formed by actress Brit-
tany Snow, MTV and Courtney
Knowles, executive director of
the Jed Foundation, a nonproﬁt

focused on preventing student
suicides.

Snow will discuss her own
struggles with emotional health
in a talk sponsored by the Pitt
Program Council, Active Minds
and the Division of Student Af-
fairs at 8:30 p.m. in the William
Pitt Union Assembly Room.

Snow and Knowles will also
discuss the “Love is Louder”
movement.

The goal of their movement is
to have high school and college
students remember the phrase
“love is louder” when they’re
feeling bullied, isolated or de-
pressed. That will be the mes-
sage they will pass on at today’s
event.

“Love is Louder” was formed
as a response to several publi-
cized suicides across the coun-
try. To promote the movement,
its creators have visited schools
throughout the country.

Snow feels a personal connec-

tion to the cause. She told MTV‘

that she experienced bullying in
school and faced difficult times
afterwards and that a good friend
had committed suicide in high
school.

The roots of the Jed Founda-
tion are similarly related to the
tragedy of suicide. The group was
started by Phil and Donna Satow
in 2000 after their son commit-
ted suicide.

Thejed Foundation’s publicist,
Lindsey Brown, said the group
hopes to “reduce emotional dis-
tress and prevent suicide among
college students.”

Since its inception, the foun-V

dation has reached more than
1,500 universities through
various programs, including an
online resource center called
ULifeline.

The event has already gar-”

nered support from University
organizations, including Active
Minds and the Talk About It Cam-
paign, student groups that pro-
mote mental health discussion.

on after reading an excerpt from
his forthcoming novel, “Houdini’s

.If you believe the plot of “Limitless,” suc-

cess is fast cars, supermodels and expensive
suits straight out of :1 Rick Ross video.
The movie follows New Yorker Eddie
Morra (Bradley Cooper) as he rapidly as-
cends from ﬁlthy, uninspired writer to mil-

lionaire ﬁnancier. -

The story begins with Morra behind
deadline on his book with’ not a single word
written. His girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cor-
nish), promptly breaks up with him and
the audience learns that Morra also ha_s a
broken marriage in his past. _

Walking the streets contemplating his

situation — unemployed and single, the ul-
timate Hollywood nightmare — Morra runs
into his ex-brother—in—law, Vernon (Johnny
Whitworth). Vernon, a former drug dealer,
is now a pharmaceutical marketer, one of
the moVie’s many satirical jabs which, dis-

appointingly, never develops into social

commentary. Vernon learns of Morra’s

writer’s block and gives him a mystery pill _

called NZT, which he says can cure all his
problems.

Indeed it does. When Morra pops the
pill, he experiences an immediate burst of
mental c-apacity.‘He cranks out his book in
a matter of days, becomes ﬂuent in several
languages, composes-music, starts drink-
ing Smartwater and can recall any con-
cept from memory instantaneously. After a
brief wardrobe change and a haircut, Lindy
falls back into his arms. But she disappears
just as quickly —— she is rarely seen on the
screen again and never stops Morra from
having casual sex with supermodels.

memory catapult him into elite social
circles, impressing attractive people at
those extravagant parties commonly seen
in liquor ads. His instant recitation of lit-
erature is used primarily for impressing

women into bed with him. Morra shows 4

no hesitation in using his “powers” for his
own self—advancement. Instead of bettering
mankind, Morra goes to work for Carl Van

_ Loon (Robert De Niro), a ﬁnancial tycoon,

conjuring millions with his ability to predict
stock prices. «
“Limitless” misses an excellent oppor-
tunity to call this vain and soulless lifestyle
into question. Morra becomes completely
absorbed in his extravagant lifestyle, for-
getting any of his past struggles, not seeing
the gift of NZT as anything more than his
ticket to money and power. .
Instead of mixing in some smart writ-

‘ing to match Morra’s intelligence, the

screenwriters were keen to pump upthe
script with action movie cliches.’There are
Russian mobsters, Wall Street crooks and
several random murders. Morra is pur-
sued by a mysterious man in a trench coat
and there is a spattering of terrible and
completely unnecessary ﬁght scenes. Just

when the plot holes are about to engulf the
last bits of the ﬁlm’s believability, they are
plastered over with an inexcusable cut to
“Six Months Later.” ‘'

The writing is dumbed down, but the rest
of the production crew must have been on
NZT. The cinematography is excellent, cap-
turing the transition from average Morra to
superhuman Morra with blooming satura-
tion and tight camera angles panning at the
incredible pace of his enhanced mind.

Cooper retains just enough of the pre-
NZT Morra to remind us that there is a
human under all that success. De Niro is
unremarkable and steals too much plot and
screen time from Lindy, who is completely
forgotten as Morra’s romantic partner or
moral compass.

At a time when ﬁnancial woes drive
many to the theater to escape, it is sad
that “Limitless” follows the line that the
rich and powerful are that way because
they deserve it. After making his ﬁrst mil-
lion speculating on stocks Morra wonders,
“How many other corporations have been
founded on NZT?” And who are we to ques-
tion the lifestyles of the rich and famous?
They are superhuman. I

“We want people to have a night where
they can share in something true and real,”
Dopico said. “I mean, you can go to the mov-
ies and share in something for sure, but to
have someone in front of your face shar-
ing about who they are is really something
magical,” she said. “There [is] so much less
face—to-face nowadays, and we want_that
here. We want to connect in a physical and
tactile way.”

The Amani International Coffee House is
a spacious and warmly lit room with words
and swirls painted on the walls and paper
lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The audi-
ence sits in folding chairs facing the three
presenting authors who stand up in front of
the crowd to perform their works.

This month’s “Speaking Of” was opened
by Andrew Mulvania, author of “Also in Arca-
dia,” from which he read a selection of poetry
describing his youth on‘ a Missouri farm.

“A raucous trail of geese ﬂy over, silver

I and bending as a single thing, the whole ﬂock

moving with one mind,” Mulvania read from
one of his poems, “Putting in the Garden.”
The Washington &]efferson College cre-
ative writing professor described his recent
work as “nonironic, formalist poems,” which
he described as “sort of unfashionable, but

not so unfashionable that they couldn’t ﬁnd
a publisher,” immediately breaking the audi-
ence into laughter. His other selections for
the evening included a poem about his young
son and his experience working at a pizza
shop under a gruff and colorful boss.

After the show, Yah Lioness described
her passion for language. “I love words ——
words are like ﬂowers I’m passing by every

is something that my mother gave me to do

Often writers in the series have their own
unique connection to Pittsburgh. For Yah
Lioness, a Pittsburgh native has “been lots
of places,” butadmits that her love of the
black—and—gold city runs deep. “I carry with
me the legacy of Pittsburgh —— it’s a place that
hasn’t been nastily exploited by the machine
the way places like New York have. But it’s
probably coming soon with the success of
people like Wiz Khalifa and people trying
to pick up the cover off of Pittsburgh like,
‘What else is cooking in here?”’

‘ Pete Madia I Pitt Athletics
The Pitt men’s soccer team played its ﬁrst game at its new home in the Petersen Sports Complex located on upper campus. The Panthers fell 1-0 to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds;"a
' professional soccer team based in the city. Pitt’s next game at the complex is Saturday against California (PA).

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Pitt upset in third round of Tournament

Tonyjovenitti

Senior Staﬂ” Writer R

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The ﬁnal
seconds of close games haven’t
been kind to the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team in the NCAA Tour-
nament.

In 2009, the top-seeded Pan-
thers fell to Villanova as Scottie
Reynolds hit a basket at the buzz-
er during the Elite Eight to deny
Pitt a Final Four appearance. Last
year, Pitt missed two last—second
3—pointers and fell to Xavier in the
second round.

This year, it looked like Pitt
would ﬁnally get a last—second win
in its third-round game against
Butler at the Verizon Center on

Saturday. But after a crazy ﬁnal -

10 seconds, Pitt wound up on the

losing end, falling to the No. 8 seed
71-70. ‘

“This is a disappointing loss for
us,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said in a news conference. “We
battled. We got down and made a
number of plays to put ourselves
in this position. We had a lead, and
just were not able to close it.”

Butler’s Andrew Smith ap-
peared to win the game with a
turnaround jumper as the clock
wound down. But as Gilbert Brown
raced up the court for a despera-
tion shot, referee Terry Wymer
whistled Butler’s Shelvin Mack for
a foul near half-court — sending
Brown to the free—throw line for
two shots with 1.4 seconds re-
maining.

Brown made the ﬁrst shot and
missed the second.

The game appeared destined

for overtime, but referee Antonio
Petty whistled Nasir Robinson for
a foul as he battled with Butler’s
Matt Howard for the rebound.
With 0.8 seconds left, Howard
made a free throw to win the game
for the Bulldogs, as Brad Wana-
maker was unable to get a shot off
after Howard intentionally missed
the second shot.

“The ups and downs of the
game, it’s really emotional during
that time period,” Brown said. “Ev—
erything could have been avoided
if I make a free throw and [Robin-
son] doesn’t foul. It’s just that’s the
way it went. They’re a great team.
All the credit is due to them.”

' Butler coach Brad Stevens,
while pleased with the outcome,
thought it was an unfortunate way
to end a game.

“You hate to see a game end

that way,” Stevens said. “But I
asked [Mack], did he think he
fouled [Brown], and he thought he
fouled him. And [Howard] thought
he got fouled. So that was the way
the game ended.”

Though the ofﬁcials called two
fouls in the ﬁnal two seconds of
the game, Dixon refused to blame
anyone but himself.

“It’s their call,” Dixon said
of the refs. “It’s their game, and
they did a very good job all the
way through. And we’re not going
to blame ofﬁcials.

“But I’m very proud of our guys.
And as always, I’ll take responsi-
bility for the loss.”

The team refused to blame
Robinson for taking the foul that
ultimately won the game for But-
ler.

“Nasir was just trying to make

a play,” Brown said. “It’s not like
he did it intentionally or anything.
He’s a hard worker. He’s a hustler.
He’s probably the hardest worker
on the team.”

But Robinson didn’t shy away
from any responsibility.

“I blame myself,” Robinson said
in the locker room. “I am smarter
than that. I have been playing this
game too long to make a dumb
mistake like that.”

So far, this year’s NCAA Tour-
nament has featured several
games that were decided by fotil
calls or non-calls in the ﬁnal sec-
onds, which have sparked a de-
bate among the college basketball
world.

Should the refs let the play-
ers decide the ﬁnal moments oﬁa
game, or is a foul in the ﬁrst half
the same as a foul in the last 10

AN 0LTMANN’S OPINION

Sports Editor

 

ﬁst two weeks ago, the Pitt men’s basket-
ball team looked primed for a run to the
Final Four.

It had just beaten Villanova to clinch
a Big East regular season championship
and was set to begin what looked to be a
promising postseason.

But now, after an early exit in their ﬁrst
game in the Big East tournament against
Connecticut and a stunning loss to Butler
in the NCAA Tournament on Saturday, the
Panthers’ season can suddenly be classi-
@d as a failure.

Even after losing to Connecticut, Pitt
was awarded a No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament in a Southeast regional brack-
et that many experts cited as the easiest
of the four Tournament regions, paving a
clear path for a Pitt run to Houston.

But the Panthers failed to make the
Final Four once again as No. 8-seed Butler
rained a barrage of 3-pointers en route to

Alex Oltmanns

a 71-70 victory on Saturday night.

But the question remains: Who should
be at fault for Saturday night’s heartbreak-
ing loss?

Some are pointing to head coach Ja-
mie Dixon for not preparing his team
well enough for postseason play or not
game—planning well enough for the Butler
matchup.

Others are putting the blame on senior
forward Gilbert Brown, who missed the
tail end of two free throws with just over a

WRESTLING

Six Panthers advance to    
second day of Championships

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

Six Pitt wrestlers advanced to the second
day of the NCAA Championships, but all
were eliminated from the competition on
Friday. ‘ '

The Panthers ﬁnished with eight wins and
15.5 points.

At 197 pounds, No. 7 seed Zac Thomus—
seit won his ﬁrst two matches on Friday
before losing to Oklahoma State’s Clayton
Foster and Virginia Tech’s Sonny Yohn, the
No. 2 and No. 9 seeds, respectively. He was
one victory shy of earning All—American
status.

In the consolation bracket, Anthony Za-
netta, 125 pounds, and Tyler Nauman, 141
pounds, won their ﬁrst matches.

After defeating Steve Bonanno of Hofstra,
Zanetta fell to Michigan’s Sean Boyle.

Nauman picked up a shut out win, 3-0,
over Cornell’s Hicks Manson but then lost
to Stephen Dutton of Lehigh in the ﬁnal
seconds.

Donnie Tasser (157 pounds), Max

Thomusseit (184 pounds) and Ryan Tomei
(285 pounds) dropped their opening match-
es of the day. _
‘ Tomei earned the Panthers’ highest seed,
entering the NCAA Championships as the
No. 6 seed. A redshirt senior, he ﬁnished
his career with a 109-34 record.

Check The Pitt News later this week for
a complete recap of the NCAA Champion-
ships. -

shouldn’t fall on any one particular player
or coach’s shoulders. This loss falls on the
entire team.

No matter whose fault the loss is, it
doesn’t take away from the disappoint-
ment that the Butler loss brings to not only
this‘year"s men’s basketball team but also
the program as a Whole.

The excitement building around the
team this year had fans dreaming of a Fi-
nal Four after spending the entire season

game,” Brown said. “We know we’ll never
be able to put the jersey on again and go
out there and play with our teammates.”

The loss to Butler is bad in itself, but

it’s how they lost — after missing a_ late
free throw and then fouling late in the
game —— that might have made this the
most disappointing loss in the program’s
history. ‘ '
“We’ve had a few losses this year, not

seconds?

Dixon said he thinks the referees have
done an adequate job, even though his team
was on the wrong end of it on Saturday.

“I think you gotta call it consistently all
the way through,” Dixon said. ‘flt doesn’t
change from time to time, team to team at
any time.” '

John Higgins, the officiating crew chief,
addressed the media in a statement after
the game.

“We do it every day,” Higgins said of
making the calls at the end of the game.
“It just happened to be a crucial part of the
game. You have to do what you have to do
as an ofﬁcial. If we get it right, we’re good. If
we get it wrong, we’re deadbeats and we’re
all over SportsCenter. We did what we think
is correct.” .

Oﬂiciating aside, it was Butler’s hot
shooting that stunned the Panthers, as the
Bulldogs made eight 3—pointers in the ﬁrst
half and Mack ﬁnished with seven 3—point-

. ers and 30 points.

Pitt had to overcome a ﬁrst—half deﬁcit,
trailing by as many as 12 points during the

ﬁrst part of the game. The Panthers opened

the second half with an 11-3 run to help set
up the nail—biting ﬁnish that Pitt is so ac-
customed to in the NCAA Tournament.

Brown led the Panthers with 24 points
and four 3—pointers on ﬁve attempts from

behind the arc. Robinson contributed 16‘ ‘

points, and Ashton Gibbs had 11.

Butler’s victory marks the Bul1dog’s sev-
enth win in their past eight NCAA Tourna-
ment games, as Butler played Cinderella

last season and made it all the way to the"

National Championship game before fall-
ing to Duke.

Stevens believes they can do it again,
especially now that his team has stolen a
No. 1 seed’s path to the Final Four.

“One thing these guys do is play through
the horn, and they’ll always play through
the horn,” Stevens said.

For Pitt, the loss marked the end of the
road for this year’s squad, as Pitt’s Final
Four hopes will once again have to wait un-
til next year. But there is no next year for
Pitt’s seniors — Brown, Wanamaker, Gary
McGhee and Nick Rivers.

“All the losses are tough,” Wanamaker
said. “For this one to be the end of it all for
me at Pittsburgh, this may be the tough-
est. I am overwhelmed with emotions right
now. I just love my teammates. If it wasn’t
for them, we wouldn’t be here today. They
made this year special for me and the other
seniors.” I

with tectonic changes in ‘technology, reading patterns, advertising, and reporting tools,
the news business is no longer the stable, gray undertaking it was only two decades
ago. 1 New forces, new sources of news, and new ways of transmitting and consuming news
have transformed both the reporting and reading experiences. This panel will examine these
changes and attempt to tackle the biggest unanswered question in the news business: who
will pay for the preparation of news and will people actually pay to consume news?
