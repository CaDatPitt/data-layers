Transplanst surgeon overcome obstacles

By Julie D. Hannon
Asst. News Editor

At the ripe age of eight, Dr. Velma Scantlebury’s curiosity
about medicine lit a fire within her as she innocently strug-
gled to tackle a chilling question — how an infected appendix
could kill her older sister.

And her curiosity only grew with time.

“There was never an alternative in my life. I just always
knew that'I wanted to be a doctor,” says the petite African-
American woman who speaks with a soft confidence behind
the mile-high stack of paperwork strewn upon her desk. _

But despite her near ﬂawless drive, the young black woman
who grew up in Barbados in the 1960s met more than her
share of roadblocks. Being female and of color, Scantlebury
learned early on that she had two strikes against her from the
word go.

“Even my own family physician said maybe I should,
instead of surgery, think of being a dermatologist,” says the
40-year-old surgeon. “Surgery was viewed as a man’s world,
and it’s not the thing a female would do 15 to 20 years ago.”'

But the struggle only sweetened the glory. Today,
Scantlebury is one of fewer than 20 female transplant sur-
geons and one of the two African-Americans. Her office is
located in Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, and she often
spends 50 to 70 hour weeks in the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, where she performs kidney transplants.

Scantlebury’s time is also divided as assistant professor of ,

surgery at Pitt’s Medical School, where she came to study
transplants in 1986 following a residency in general surgery
at Harlem Hospital in New York. She has been a staff mem-
ber since 1988.

She received her medical degree in 1981 from Columbia-

University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons in New

York. She originally arrived in the Steel City with-the-~int'ent.v

to use transplant surgery as a stepping stone‘ to pediatric
surgery, but opportunity knocked and Scantlebury stayed put.
“I never planned on staying in Pittsburgh. My first real
female role model in the field was a pediatric surgeon, and I
was going to be just like her,” said Scantlebury with a smile.

Police prepare for

By Anthony Breznican

Sixteen long years and the Steelers are going
back to the Super Bowl — hopefully for a win
, —— but win or lose, the Pittsburgh and Campus

 Police are bracing themselves for the inevitable
uproar facing the city on Sunday.

Gary Moses, assistant chief of the Pitt Police.
, has patroled the city of Pittsburgh during three

" Super Bowls and one World Series involving
Pittsburgh teams.

Though a win for the Steelers is hoped for. it
could also mean crowd—contro1 problems and
' damage to property. I -

In theunfortunate event that the Steelers lose
to Dallas, police expect the streets to be very
quiet.

“If there’s a loss, we don’t expect anything.
Moses said. .“In the event of a victory. there’s :1
contingency plan to increase security for the
area.”

City police have sectioned off the city in past
events to control the ﬂow of traffic and limit the
size of crowds.

Considering the layout of a city like Pittsburgh.
this is easily done by closing off bridges into

Keeping your New Year's resolve

You are probably already
beginning to slip a little on
your New Year’s resolutions.
A month from now, they will
probably be forgotten. Since
this pattern repeats itself over

- and over again for most of us.

why do we bother to make res-
olutions? One answer is that
we are not happy with some
aspects of our lives, and
though our follow—through is
often weak, our plans to
change begin with good
intentions and much opti-
mism.

There are many good rea-
sons why we don’t or can’t
keep our ' resolutions.
Among the most common
are choosing goals that stir
up underlying fears that
impede our progress, are too
general in nature and beyond
our present ability to achieve.
Sometimes all three of these
difficulties may be encountered
within one resolution.

Take, for instance, the seem-
ingly straightforward resolu-
tion of determining to be a bet-
ter student next term. This
worthy resolve may _ be
doomed to failure if not exarn—
ined more closely. Some stu-
dents, for example, are terrified
of discovering that there are
limits to their abilities.
Consequently, they never go
all out for fear that they may
not do well and be forced to

face their limitations. It’s better

to blame it on some other fac-
tor, such as a procrastination
problem. The solution to this
problem is somewhat elusive
and may require some counsel-
ing assistance to adequately
address it.

The plan to become a better
student is also too general. The
chance of success is greatly

011

    

enhanced by addressing the
specific things good students
do —- attend classes regularly,
ask questions, take good notes,
establish a regular study sched-
ule, etc. Breaking a general
goal into sub-goals that are
clearly achievable is an effec-
tive strategy. _

A resolution may also fail
because a basic skill needed
forsuccess is lacking. In this
instance, the resolution to be a
better student must begin with
a realistic assessment of skills,
followed perhaps by a visit to
the Learning Skills Center or
to the Writing Workshop for
specialized assistance.

Whatever goals you establish

mpus

— whether they are to become
more social, to lose weight, to
become more assertive or to
overcome some basic fear —
take time to think about the
core issues that interfered with
your achievement of these
goals in the past. Then estab-
lish some concrete, achievable
goals, work on the skills need-
ed to achieve them, and
don’t be afraid to ask for
help.

An even more efficient
way of making progress
toward your personal goals
_ is to take a little time each
morning to make some
daily resolutions. Just for
that day, resolve to speak
up for yourself, to eat
healthier, to hug someone,
to exercise a little, to take a
risk, to enjoy yourself, to face
something you fear with
courage, to make it a day you
can be proud of when you go
to bed that night. It’s easy
enough to tell yourself what
you are going to do next
month. What will really make
a difference in your life is
holding yourself accountable
for your daily commitments. It
ties in with the old aphorism:
“Yard by yard, life is hard; but
inch by inch, life’s a cinch.”
Welcome to another new year
and another chance to become
the master of your resolutions.

Opinions

Conﬂicts of interest

Most of us have applied for loans or grants to help pay for
school. and a lot of us have been turned down. But how would
you like to be able to tell PHEAA or PELL that you disagreed
with the assessment and would like it to be reconsidered? The
government would probably laugh in your face. But what if you
could force it to reevaluate your application? And then even If. it
decided to turn you down a second time, you would have the abil-
ity to overturn the denial. Wouldn’t that make funding your edu-
cation a whole lot easier‘? ' _ _

Now consider a similar scenario. You are an elected official on
a board and supposedly represent your peers. One of your jobs is
to choose the members of an allocations committee that will
make funding decisions for all the groups that request money,
including the board which chose the members of the allocations
committee in the first place. I

Add this scenario to the first, and you can get a pretty good pic-
ture of the inner mysteries of our own beloved Student
Government Board. -

The people we elect to our Student Government Board are in
charge of selecting the‘ members of the Allocations Committee.
That committee is in charge of allocating funds to all student
groups, including to the SGB itself. However, the members of -the
SGB have to approve or disapprove of every decision made by
the Allocations Committee. This includes decisions regarding the
SGB’s own requests. ’

About two weeks ago, the SGB requested a total sum of
$14,663.00 from the Allocations Committee to purchase new

9 computers and Internet hook-ups for the SGB office.

Surprisingly, Tuesday night the Allocations Committee
announced that the request had been denied. But when the presi-
dent of the board asked the members either to approve or disap-
prove, guess what happened? (This is a tough one, so take your
time.) _

Yes, the SGB voted unanimously to disapprove the denial, and
the Allocations Committee must now “reconsider” the request.
Even if the allocations committee votes again to deny the request,
the SGB will have the ﬁnal say on whether or not to accept a sec-
ond denial. Hmmm  How do you think they will vote?

This is, quite possibly, the most blatant conﬂict of interest we
have ever heard of in the university. It’s no wonder that so few
people know how the allocations process works: This is- a juicy
little secret that is better if no one knows. 9

Does anyone remember hearing anything about this request

I before or during elections — not only the process. but the fact

that SGB decided .to spend students’ money on new computers
for its office? No one seemed to mention those plans during the .
election, probably because most students might be a little irritated
to find out their money is being spent for something like this.
New computers will provide the SGB with all the technology
already existing in every computer lab on campus. How neces-
sary!

This kind of thing is a perfect example of the real workings of
the SGB. Maybe now we all might be able to figure out why so
little is done on things which will actually effect students on this
campus: SGB is too busy voting itself money to buy computers.

Check box two for campus safety

We, the students of the
University of Pittsburgh, pay a
combined $1 million in activi-
ties fees each year! One million
dollars. That might sound like a
lot of money, and, well  it is. I
think an interesting way of
looking at it is to divide it into
scholarships. Let’s say it costs
approximately $9000 a year for
a student’s room, board and
tuition. With the money we pay

for activities, over one hundred

students could go to school here
free. Which would you rather
have, an opportunity to escape
all of those student loans or the
numerous activities I’m sure
we’ve all attended in the past
year? . '

Let’s take a look at how our
money was distributed. The
SGB received $51,000. That’s
ﬁve and a half scholarships. Of
that money, $20,000 went to
committees. O.K., it’s quiz time.
I’ll award a free Terrible Towel
to anyone out there who can
actually name one SGB com-
mittee. Another $4,900 went to
the SGB elections. How much
cheaper would it be if we all
just wrote our choices on a slip
of paper and put them in a box?
With the level of voter turnout,
my method wouldn’t entail
much more time to count votes.

The BAS received the second
largest allocation. Its $33,000
comes to three and a half schol-
arships. The interesting part of
this is how the money was
obtained. Activities fees are
allocated based on how many
members the group has. In an
incredibly astute move, the
BAS claims EVERY black stu-
dent on ‘campus, whether they
are active or not. Guess what? I
just formed my own club. It’s
called the Pitt Student
Organized Federation (PSOF.)
My organization claims every
Pitt student as a member.
whether they are active or not.
I’m expecting a rather large
check in my mailbox any day
now. I

The Greek organizations

asoii
urtis

. received the third largest alloca-

tion. My question in regard to
this is: “Where do the dues go
that all the brothers and sisters
pay?” I have a little tip. You see,
if you return the keg to the dis-
tributor, you get your deposit
back. Or maybe the dues go to
help defray the rising cost of
ﬁlm and developing.

So what is the solution? Some

people have suggested that the

breakdown of the allocations
should be published in order for
students to have a better idea

‘wheretheir money is going.

This is a fairly good idea but
doesn’t really solve anything for
two reasons. One is that an
itemized breakdown may not
necessarily stir any student
interest, and therefore nothing
would probably come of it: The
other is that even if every Pitt
student saw the allocations, got
really freakin’ mad, joined
hands with his/her fellow met-
riculators and sang inheavenly
voices about the injustice of it
all, nothing would change. (At
this point the word “Marriott”
should be at the fore of every-
one’s brains.)

My solution is one in which
every student would have a very
simple choice. On the tuition
bill would be an area where the
$40 activities fee charge used to
be. In its place would be two
boxes. If you check the first
box, your $40 would belsent to
an activities fund to be divided
up in a way similar to the cur-
rent system. If you checked the
second box, your $40 would be
sent to the “Campus Safety
Fund.” Money in the safety
fund would be used to hire
more police, provide more
lighting, set up anescort ser-
vice. etc. If you feel that your
organizations and activities are
more important than your safe-
ty, then check the ﬁrst box. My
main goal is get an education
while maintaining use of all the

body parts I had when I gradu-
ated from high school. I think
I’ll check the second box.

What would happen to all our
activities? I’m sure they would
still be around, simply in small-
er and possibly more efficient
versions. There will still be
some money coming in from
the university. There is also this
dirty little concept called
“fundraising.” Fundraising hap-
pens when people actually care
enough about an organization
that they either donate money to
it~or work to collect money for

/it. By suggesting-this, I don’t

mean to say that people in orga-
nizations don’t work hard in
them. Under my system, any
money which can be raised
would be added to the alloca-
tion. This not only provides a
certain degree of autonomy to
the organization, but it also
gives the members valuable
experience for future work of
this sort.

Will my suggestions ever
come to fruition? Probably not.
No one has ever acted on my
suggestions in the past, so I

don’t expect people to start now. '

Are my suggestions valid and in

' the best interest of the universi-

ty? That is for you to decide.
Think about it this way. If you
are a parent trying to decide
where to send your child to
school, what is important to
you? Are you more concerned
with crime rate on campus or
the fact that the school supports
its Male Chinese Lesbian
Jewish Flaming Trapeze of

Death Club? (For the uninitiat- XE

ed, that is the MCLJFT 0’ DC.)
Look at it another way. The
next time you’re sitting at a club
meeting while one of your fel-
low students gets shot in the
street, think about this article

and think about the family that 
wishes it had the opportunity to '4

more than eight points.

Something had to give, and Pitt returned to its
losing ways (3-15 overall, 2-7 Big East), dropping
a 71-55 decision to the visiting Lady Wildcats.

“It «would’ve been nice to get this one,
Panther Head Coach Kirk Bruce, whose squad had
beaten the ‘Cats just nine days prior to this con-
test. “They’ve got an uppperclassmen-laden team,

and they played like it.”

Latia Howard, named Big East Player of the
Week this Tuesday, started the contest with a
three-point play, giving Pitt a 3-0 lead that stood
for over three minutes thanks to poor shooting
from both squads. Pitt built up a 7-2 lead early in
the ballgame with field goals from freshman Gina
Montesano and senior Stephanie Petho, forcing a
Villanova timeout five minutes into the ballgame.

Bruce summed up the next 55 minutes of play
very accurately, saying, .“We started the game in
decent fashion, and the next thing you know  “ _

Wildcat Head Coach Harry Perretta woke his »
team up during the break, and they did not fall
asleep again for the rest of the evening. A 12-4
Villanova run ending with two Jenn Beisel layups
put the Lady ‘Cats ahead for good at 14-13. The

, next thing Bruce and his squad knew, they were
fighting to stay within 10, finally managing to
claw back to a 31-25 halftime score. »

“We knew Jenn Beisel would be tough for us to
defend,” said Bruce of the Villanova sophomore
who scored 14 points off the bench on the night.

Behind Beisel and All-American candidate

. Denise Dillon, the Wildcats controlled the rest of .
the contest, opening» their lead as far as 20 points
late in the second half and_finishing with a 16-
point margin. Dillon led all scorers with 25.
points. She also led all rebounders with 12,
including 10 on the defensive glass.

Flood of'96 nearly
wrecks Piﬂ crew

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

A little bit of luck and some quick planning saved Pitt
Crew’s boats during last weekend’s ﬂooding. Boats belonging
to several local high schools sustained damage when eight to
10 feet of water inundated the boat house. _

“Another 10 feet are expected tonight [Wednesday],” said
sophomore and lightweight eight rower, Matt Conrad.

_“We don’t expect it to get into our bay this time,” said Coach
Todd Ridenour. “I was down there a hour ago.”
Afterpractice yesterday, team members checked that the
' boats were properly tied down. They had just finished cleaning
up debris from the weekend. Tuesday, a bulldozer removed ice
debris from the Three Rivers Rowing Association parking lot.

Sunday, when Ridenour went down for clean up, he found a
fish in the boat house door. . _ .

‘fl was there for probably seven hours,” Ridenour said. ‘The
damage could’ve been worse.” V

A “A ‘few motors weren’t working and a few tools might have
ﬂooded away,” said sophomore and varsity lightweight eight
rower Jordan Rabin. “But we’re in pretty good shape compared
to whatpeople predicted.” ’

O_nce_'the flooding subsided, the boat room was littered with
oars, debris and silt. The mudline, left by the retreating water,
was at the top of the room. 7

“We were lucky,” said Rabin.

It was more than luck. Mike Lambert, executive director of
the Three Rivers. Boating Association, drilled holes in the bot-
tom of the Pitt boats so the trapped water could move around

i once the ﬂooding began. _
‘_“He didn’t want theboats to act as buoys,” said Conrad. “It

Southern Man Albert French

 

“If I get hit by a bus I’d be

pissed off as hell. But that’s

okay I leave behind Patches of
_F_ir_e_, l_3_im¢, and lﬂy,” Albert
French proclaims after three
glasses of wine. “What’s

‘important is what I leave

behind, a commitment to a
future that I will not be a part
of, but my work will.” French is
Pittsburgh’s latest literary suc-
cess and one of the most well-
known authors of our time. He

grew up in Homewood, and

began a writing career at the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He ’
then went on to publish his
own magazine called the
Pittsburgh Preview. His career
went from journalism to litera-
ture when a publisher ran
across French’s.first short

_story,P h fFir and

Doubleday printed it in 1992.
He then wrote ﬂiﬂy which
made its mark in book stores
internationally with its crisp
depiction of a rustic American
south. Writers became excited
that a fresh Afro-American
author had emerged, but if you

A ask French— he’s just black,

and he just writes.

“People will read Emy and
see the fear in a young black
child in Mississippi. They may
see and feel a young girl,

‘Holly, living in America who is

not free to love who she wish-

i 3*‘; es. I leave behind these ques-

tions to beanswered |ater,”
French says.

Dressed in a grey tweed
coat and red scarf, French sat
in a dimly lit Hemingway's
chain smoking Merit cigar-
rettes. The soft smell of his

’ spicey tobacco reminded me

of Kentucky. In French’s deep

- raspy voice you could hear a
— hauntingaccent that mixed a

lazy southern tongue with the
slang of the north. Our inter-
view was extremely unortha-
dox and resulted in a night
filled with conversational
dreaming and soft-spoken
debates. French is a comfort-

. able speaker that makes his

presence felt wherever he

T goes. French doesn't need a

best-seller to attract attention:
his chrisma and stamina alone
can write a story.

Lolley: I know you began as a
photographer at the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazzette and then went
on to write your own articles.
How did that start your writing?
French: Looking back l’ve
never written a story that has
not been bought or published.
I don’t know what the secret of
my success is, but I think it is
probably that I will do what I
say, everything. I am not
afraid. I do have fear, but I
don’t let that stop me do what I
am going to do.

Lolley: What do you find the
most intriguing about the
South since your books are set
there? ’ ,
French: People are real with
their emotions, real with their

    lolly

P P, Y» -
They follow through on their
convictions, there’ is a freedom
to that. Whereas in the north

, people, are more traditionalized
and don’t follow through with
their inner convictions. For
example, an individual racist

who lives in the north willhide '

. it in their closet. But in the
South that freedom brings it .
‘out. It is real. It may not be
good. It may not be bad. But
it’s real. In being real you have
a substance that added to the
other substance that already
exists you have a big pot of
energies to work with. The
south is honest with it’_s bar-
bancnessf

hip-hop? In Pittsburgh? Huh?”

True, while da Burgh has its share
rock shows n’at, hip-hop here might as
well be dead. Tribe Called Quest is the
last rap act i saw here, and that was
two years ago. But mark your calen-
dars, kids, because Friday night, some
enterprising local heads’ are set to pull
of.’ nothing less than the rebirth of a
scene.

That’s when Society of Urban Poets
(that's SUP) presents That Thingl, a
showcase of local flavor unlike any-
thing you’re likely to have seen, espe-
cially on the Pitt campus. The show, in
the WPU Assembly room, headlines
with Strict F.L.O.W. The Math Team,
Demented Wordsmiff and DJ Selecta.
As a concept, the show is all about DIY
as it applies to hip-hop.

According to Masai, head of SUP,
rap in Pittsburgh has been “nonexis-
tent, period” because promoters got
scared by gangsta rap and bad experi-
ences at shows a few years ago. Now
their reaction is, “Oh no, rap concert, a
whole bunch of people going crazy!" As
a result, local acts can't get a foot in
the door, and only the biggest national
acts play mainstream venues. So SUP
set up That Thing! to give local
unsigned acts a chance to show skills
to the local crowd and prove that hip-
hop shows can be nonviolent.

Strict F .L.OW_., one of the bill’s head-
liners, aim to represent the positive,
poetic elements of hip-hop to the world.

‘The group is composed" of Saied
, Chatirour, Kevin Harris and Masai and

describe themselves as “poets, lyri-
cists. We're just takin’ it back to where
it started and givin’ it our own ‘96 twist.”
They skip the politics and violence, and
don’t brag about “our clothes or how
many women we have sex with,” they
just get on the mic and demonstrate
their lyrical skills and flow. The focus is
on pure hip-hop enjoyment, not posing
and talkin’ shit.

Musically, the group offers a jazz-
based sound with samples from stan-

will be promoting their new tape,
Trifecta, set for release on the 26th.

The Math Team, also headlining,

offers a different take on ‘96 rap. It fea-

tures'Omar Abdul Lawrence, formerly .

of locals Double O Sessions, and
bases its sound on live instruments.
Masai says Lawrence will “be coming
with live band for most of his perfor-
mances in ‘96.” The Math Team flow
resembles the Roots, with live backup
and a nonviolent rhyme attack. They

are self-produced and write their own . _
music, while Strict F.L.O.W. relies more _1

on a traditional producer-collaboration

approach. The Math Team will also  g _ _ V .

Demented Wordsmiff, the main sub-

new release.

There’s been kind of a
renaissance going on in the
Pittsburgh underground lately.
In the past couple months, I've
seen a lot of new bands pop
up, and there’ve been a lot of
.00! people who have become
involved in the scene. There
have been more shows being
put on than there. were at this
time last year, as well as some
new local zines popping up.

This resurgence in the D.l.Y.
spirit makes me proud to live
in this town. There’s a lot
going on, but a lot of people
fail to see it. If you've gotten
nothing else out of reading my
column, I want you to realize
that you can write whatever
you want, and you can put it
out yourself. You don’t have to
send it in to some literary mag-
azine and hope that some
snobbish college professor
who doesn't know or care
about you decides that it's
worthy to be printed. Because
if you think it's worthy, that’s all
that matters. Besides, if you
write something down, there
are probably one thousand
people who feel the same way.
Even if you don’t have the
energy to put out a zine your-
self, there’re a lot of zines out
there that will gladly accept
submissions. Write to me, and
I can try to get you in touch.

One local zine that’s found
its way into my hands lately is
Disgruntled T. V. #17/The
Pear. lt’s a split between the
two zines, with the DTV sec-
tion taking up the majority of
the zine. But really, the two
zines are pretty similar in style,

and it was difficult for me to tell-

where one ended and the
other began. Both consist
mostly of random thoughts and

nd

'.V.

writing. Reading the DTV part
really helped me to get an idea
of what the author is like. It
was more like having a con-
versation with her than reading
a traditional style-magazine.
The drawback to this approach
is that, like a conversation,
topics come up at random and
are dropped just as quickly.
So, in some ways, all the sec-
tions don’t really hold together
well as a single unified work.
It's a trade-off. There’s also
some record reviews and con-
tact addresses for other zines.
One thing that really
impressed me is—that you can
just taste the authors’ enthusi-
asm. They just seem really
excited about the scene, and
that gets me excited. If you
see this, it's free, so you have
no excuse for not picking it up.
Or you can send 50 cents in
stamps to Nicole Disgruntl/

Endnotes: Last column, I
called The Phoenix sexist and
homophobic. I also consider it
racist (holding up the quote
“white man bringum diseases”
as an example), but I forgot to
mention it then.

If anyone is inspired to do a
zine, or just wants to know
more, or whatever, write me in
care of this newspaper or at:
jjcst25@pitt.edu.

My band is planning a tour
over spring break (March 2-

people who will put us up or
any places that put on
punk/alternative/indie shows
within a day's driving distance,
get in touch.

lt’s certainly not news to
anyone that local television
reporting exhibits some real
intellectual poverty in many
cases. The recent PAT bus
crash has led to numerous
speculations in the name of
providing the public with an
explanation to this tragedy.
Finally, a WTAE news story
last week fell completely
down the increasingly slip-
pery slope, landing reporter
Alan Jennings squarely on
his journalistic behind dis-

seminating near misinforma-
tion.
Presumably serving as

public watchdog, Mr.
Jennings does a hard-hitting
piece of civilian police work.
Using a radar gun, this crack
reporter clocks PAT buses
while he's parked on a
bridge above a section of
the busway near the scene
of the previous week’s acci-
dent. The result, several
buses over the 40 mph
speed limit. Almost all of

a whopping 49 mph.

What I was waiting for, but
which never came, was the
information that would
essentially negate the
story’s findings. The accura-
cy of radar guns is less than
perfect. Such proof can be
found in the list of fines post-
ed on highways. Fines do
not start at 56 mph. A 5 mph
or more buffer is added to
the speed limit because tick-

Lost in Yonkers

Playhouse Theatre Company
directed by John Amplas

Neil Simon has always been
known for writing fluffy, whimsical
plays that do well on Broadway and
make successful film adaptations.
Hits like California Suite, Laughter
on the 22nd Floor and Barefoot in
the Park have all provided light-
hearted entertainment without dar-
ing to probe into deeper aspects of
the human condition. However, one
of Simon’s most famous plays, and
perhaps his finest piece of writing
for the stage, Lost in Yonkers,
boldly explores issues of filial dys-
function and love without forgetting
to maintain an amusing level of
light comedy. Playhouse Theatre
Company has the gumption to take
on the difficult job of executing
comedy amidst the thoughtful and
emotional issues of this play.

Lost in Yonkers is set in 1942
New York and relates a period of

time when two teenage brothers,
Jay and Arty, are left in the care of
their stern Grandmother Kurnitz.
The boys’ father, Eddie, takes a job
as a traveling salesman to pay for
his mounting debts. Jay and Arty’s
kooky Aunt Bella (the role made
famous by Mercedes Reuhl in the
film adaptation) stays with them
and their grandmother above the
family-owned candy store. The
character of Aunt Bella touches on
the notion of human frailty amidst
all the strength needed to survive
as a Jewish-American during World
War II. Simon illustrates, through
the portrayal of Bella, what hap-
pens to people when they don’t feel
love. Bella’s insecurities and men-
tal quirks are effectively contrasted
with Grandmother Kurnitz’s iron-
fisted, unflinching approach to life.
The confrontational ending
between Bella and her mother
powerfully signifies the theme of
the play: Survival is necessary, but
not at the cost of love.

    

Executing comedy amidst
thoughtful and emotional issues is
a hard task, but the cast of
Playhouse Theatre’s Lost in
Yonkers is certainly capable.
Veteran local actress Audrey
Castracane appears as Grandma
Kurnitz and succeeds in communi-
cating the strength and power of
her character without exaggerated
emotions or action. She subtly
commands respect and gives an
authentic, honest performance.
The eccentric character of Aunt
Bella is played by Robin Walsh,
who appeared in Point Park's
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? last
year. Although Walsh appears a lit-
tle forced at times, the strange
vagaries of her character a.re
amusing and touching. Nationally
recognized film and stage actor Bill
Mott plays the slick Louie, Eddie
and Bella’s brother. Mott displays a
likable quality of panache as Louie
and also shows how he is weak-
ened by his mother's strict upbring-
ing. Point Park College theatre stu-
dents Vaughn A. Challingsworth
and Ryan Calderhead play Jay and

Arty, respectively, and are skillful in _

presenting two opposing personali-

5 G G January 25 1996

ties (intelligence and thoughtful-
ness in Jay and childlike happiness
in Arty). Challingsworth, especially,
handles complicated scenes with
Mott and Walsh rather well and
shows some maturity on stage as
an actor.

Director John Amplas has
diverse experience in theatre, with
directing credits ranging from The
Threepenny Opera to Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf? His versatility
shows in this production of Lost in
Yonkers, as all of his actors are
quite comfortable with one another
and work cohesively towards the
same goal. The cast’s unified and
secure performance is a reflection
of its excellent direction. Finally,
Point Park Theatre energetically
showcases its abundant talent and
facility with tricky plays like Lost in
Yonkers.

Lost in Yonkers runs tonight thru
February 4th at the Hamlet Street
Theatre of the Point Park College
Playhouse. Curtain at 8 p.m. Wed.
thru Sat. and a 2 p.m matinee on
Sundays. Tickets are $16 and $18

Leaving Las Vegas
Starring Nicholas Cage
and Elizabeth Shue

Directed by Mike Riggis

As morbid as it sounds, the
first thing that attracted me to
Leaving Las Vegas was the fact
that the screenplay was adapted
from a semi-autobiographical
novel whose author killed him-
self two weeks after production.
This “rea|” death intertwined with
pretend life is mystifying and
needless-to-say, sparks my
curiosity. Similarly, “rea|” death
was my only reason for
seeing The Crow. However,
unlike the overrated Crow movie
which did have‘ a lot of media
hype and the ever—so-admired
teen heartbeat Brandon Lee, the
underexposed Leaving Las
Vegas delves into a world
where the leading man is the
not-so-attractive, but somewhat
talented Nicholas Cage, portray-
ing a once successful but
always drunk writer, and his
female, prostitute counterpart,
who I thought had peaked in
Adventures in Babysitting, -
Elizabeth Shue.

If I had to place Nicholas Cage
in yet another off-beat romance
story, I can't help but think of the
ever-flattering Lula as his lead-
ing lady. Leaving Las Vegas
tells the story of two displaced

life and are, simply put, lonely.
At first, Ben (Cage) and Sera
(Shue) live separate lives in dif-
ferent towns. Upon losing his job
for being too much of a drunk,
Ben heads to Las Vegas and is

somehow magically, amidst the A

chaotic lights of the city in the
desert, brought together with
Sera. Their meeting occurs as
Ben requests Sera’s services,
and Sera finds out that all of the
alcohol Ben has consumed in
his quest for death has not
helped his sex life. Since Ben
has no real need for sex (as
most men in her life do,) and
just alcohol, Sera holds on to
him, realizing that even though
Ben is a drunk, he is a good per-
son, and she is no longer alone.
What I find so interesting about
Leaving Las Vegas is Shue’s
portrayal of Sera and her
attempt to make the relationship
work without either person
changing. (Just a note here

since the Golden Globe Awards —

are over, I thought Shue
deserved the award, but unfortu-
nately she did not; however
some people thought Nicholas
Coppolla, I mean Cage, was
deserving.) Matter of fact, that
was part of the deal in starting
their relationship: that each

Dust Brothers, who were best
known for their integral part in
the Beastie Boys’ landmark

As word of their knob-twiddling
skill spread they in turn influ-

including a pair of London
DJs/producers who in tribute
named themselves  the Dust

Everyone should Get Hip
immediately to bands like the
Mount McKinleys, Highway
61, and the reigning Kings (if
only in my kingdom) of Iron
City Flock ‘n Roll, the Steel
Miners. That’s not to mention
the other eighteen or nineteen
good bands in Pittsburgh,
some of whom actually play
music whose style is not dic-
tated by the current trends.

Call the McKinleys “retro”
punk, or rock if it makes you
happy to use that word. _
Certainly the sound conjured
up by the term “garage rock”
would also apply to their
sound. Of course, we cannot
forget their wacky surf roots.
Whatever you want to call
them, just be sure and catch
the band live the next chance
you get. Not many bands live

up to the expectations of an
entertaining rock show, but
the McKinleys leave no one
disappointed.

Indeed their first full-length
record, “Portrait of a
Mindbender’ is an accurate
testament to this band’s ability
to rock. The vocals on the
record (shared by all four
bandmembers, as with their
live show) come out a bit
clearer than they do live, _
although I prefer the live vocal
sound, personally. The album
is on the Cynics’ guitarist
Greg KosteIich’s Get Hip
label, and Cynics bassist
“Demon Dave” Vucenich also
plays bass for the Mount
McKinleys. Drummer Joe ~
Morrison is simply incredible,
especially to see him actually
stand behind his kit while
playing.

Guitarists Kurt Edwards and
Matt Coyne have studied their
rock ‘n roll handbooks well,

4—

and Lee Hollihan’s recording

really captures the essence of ‘

their sound. If this alum is any
indication of the level of quali-
ty we can expect on local
releases in ‘96 (and just this
month we have quite a few of

. them coming out), then it
promises to be a very good
year indeed.

Fans of anything from the
Stooges and the Ramones to
Dick Dale or Man or
Astroman? will thoroughly
enjoy this record. There are
still a few instrumentals on this
one, and a really amazing
“experimental” piece entitled
“Oscar Goldman Jr," on which
Mr. Edwards adopts a Lee
Ranaldoesque vocal narrative
style that I've never heard in
their live show. “Bring You
Down” reminds me a bit of
their labelmates the Steel
Miners, and it is a delightfully
trashy tune. In the end, the
McKinleys can be mistaken

The Pitt News, Thursday, January 25,1996 .

 

I hate people who like the Dallas Cowboys, a team whose allegiance
boasts of the largest bandwagon and most pathetic following in sports (of
which, Pitt’s most notorious diunkard, Mark Gordon, has proudly hopped

on).

Pittsburgh \will beat the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, sorry to disap-
point anybody who decided that the ‘Boys were cool after they signed

Deion Sanders.

People who think the Cowboys will crush the Steelers are in for a sur-
prise; obviously these people didn’t watch the “Stillers” win 10 of their

last 11 games.

The gamenlooks even going, but here’s why Pittsburgh will win:

Neil O’Donnell will outplay Troy Aikman. Much has been made about
the prowess of Aikman in the playoffs. His record is 9-1. But O’Donnell
has yet to be stopped since offensive coordinator Ron“Erhar‘dt implement-
ed the f1ve—receiver offense, and he is a very good postseason QB in his

own right.
Better go get a sixer, Gordon.

Aikman will have difficulty throwing because the Steelers defense, behind Ray Seals and
. Brentson Buckner, will shut down Emmitt Smith early in the game, forcing Aikman into a
game he can’t win — a passing game. The Cowboys aren’t as deep in the receiver category

as the Steelers.

The reason Pittsburgh will shut down Emmitt is coaching, a category in which Pittsburgh

Freshman standout
Montesano was shutout
after her early bucket, scor-
ing just two in 32 minutes.
Petho was held to eight on
the evening, going only 2-6
from the-floor in the con-
test. As a squad, the Panther
women could shoot only 35
percent from the floor,
including a dismal 8-24 per-
formance in the first half.

‘The Wildcats shot 39 ‘per-

cent in the first stanza, bet-

ter than Pitt ‘could muster,
but nowhere near the 64
percent shooting clinic that
the ‘Cats put on in the sec-
ond. Bruce said Villanova’s
aggressive ball movement
overwhelmed the Panther
defense.

“We were chasing,” said
Bruce, “playing behind
them. You can’t defend like
that.”

Like her offensive perfor-
mance, Howard’s defensive
game was out of place in
her squad’s defeat. She held
all Villanova centers score-
less for the entire first half
and allowed starting
Wildcat center Shannon
Ferretti only four points the

. entire ballgame.

“[Latia] is capable of this
every night,” said Bruce.
“She’s in there ‘— active.”

While Howard stayed
active underneath all
evening, the Panther
perimeter play was silenced.
Along with Petho’s troubles,
starting point guard JoJo
Guzman made only one shot
of three in 30 minutes of
play. The team’s only 3-
point shotof the night came
from LaTo‘nya Durham with
under three minutes to play.

Villanova’s backcourt
responded with four three-
pointers, three from senior

Sue Glenning. Gleniningt

scored 16 points for the
evening, and led the team
with five assists and three
steals. -

Sorry, Steeler fans. It’s just not going to happen.

Here’s the bottom line. The Dallas Cowboys are better at almost
every position, and it’s going to show on the scoreboard Sunday.

My good friend Mike Kovak obviously smoked too much dope
watching Kevin Greene and Hulk Hogan beat up on Ric Flair.

The Cowboys are going to control the “60 Minute Men” from
minute number one, and the only thing Kovak will be putting on
1 his thumb is a Cracker Jack ring.

There are a lot of reasons why the ‘Boys are going to crush the
Stiller_s, but the key is Emmitt Smith. '

He has been the best running back in the NFL the past five
years —— better than Barry Sanders. Sure he’s got a huge offen-
sive line and Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin to take some of the
pressure off. But no one can take control of a game like number
22.

I’ve seen him do it many times against the New York Giants,
who by the way, have won TWO Super Bowls in the last 10
years, while the Steelershave zip.

Two years ago in the season finale against the Giants, he launched the
Cowboys into the play-offs with a 175-yard rushing performance while his right
shoulder was separated.

Emmitt is going to run straight through the Steel Curtain, no doubt about it.

And while we’re on the Steelers’ defense, let me point out a few misconcep-

will devise a scheme to stop Smith; what
will Barry “The Genius” Switzer do then?

Gordon talks about how many times
Smith has run over the NY Giants. But let’s
remember, Gordon’s memory only spans
back approximately three seasons; that’s
because he spends most of his time in a
drunken stupor. Besides, the Giants suck.
They can’t stop Andre the Giant from gain-
ing 200 yards a game. .

The Steelers defense ranked second
against the run in the NFL this season, set-
ting a franchise record for least rushing
yards allowed

The Cowboys defense." Remember when
Rodney Hampton, from those sueky
Giants, rushed for 189 yards against the

‘Boys? The Steelers line is a good cohesive ’

unit, and they should be able to get the
ground game going against a defense led by
Leon Lett “Down”, who’s been sited at
Uncle Jimmy’s with Gordon, not only

‘drinking, but also smoking marijuana. Lett

plans to puff down a dimebag before the

game.

The Steelers may not throw much in the
way of Sanders, but they will certainly run
at him. Deion can’t tackle kickers; when
Bam Morris eyes him up going around the
left comer, expect a collision, and expect
Morris to keep running.

The Dallas defense has the holes, and
Pittsburgh has the talent, desire and intelli-
gence to exploit them. A 13 1/2 point
underdog is the most ridiculous point
spread ever.

Pittsburgh will play a superb Super Bowl.

The offense will click and the defense will
stick They’ll win this game outright, and
by a comfortable margin, 27- 13.

And after the game, it won’t be the ‘Boys
bitching about the 1 am. alcohol curfew in
Arizona. But that’s alright, Gordon will cer-
tainly have a keg waiting for Jerry Jones
and the Arrogant Cowboys.

tions that Kovak has in his brain.
Again, too much dope.

Rod Woodson should stick to run-
ning his restaurant. At least there he
could control how light or dark his
toast will be.

Because in Tempe, Irvin and Kevin
Williams are going to burn him up.
(Relax politically correct freaks, the
comment about Woodson has nothing
to do with his skin color, only his Tim
McKyer—like corner skills.)

And here’s a note to Kevin Greene:
Your attempt at imitating. the greatest
linebacker ever — Lawrence Taylor, in
case you’re smoking some of Kovak’s
dope — is a poor one. The only simi-
larities between Greene and L.T. is that
they both are professional wrestlers,
and Taylor’s better at that, too.

But the Steelers’ defense is not their
downfall. It’s_the Neil O’Donnell-led
offense.

The following names are all quarter-

backs who have won Super Bowls:
Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Troy
Aikman, Phil Simms, Steve Young. If
you think O’Donnell belongs on this
list, then you definitely were smoking
some of Kovak’s dope.

The rest of the Steelers’ offensive is
just that — offensive. Bam Morris
would be the third running back, at
best, on the Cowboys, and Yancey
Thigpen would have a tough time
cracknig the talented Cowcboys start-
ing line—up.

Face it, black and gold fans. The
Steelers just don’t match up. I hate the
Cowboys (especially Neon Deion
Prime Time Slime or whatever) just as

‘ much as the next guy, but I’m not

smoking Kovak’s dope.

Mark Gordon is the Editor in Chief

‘of The Pitt News and doesn’t care who

wins the Super Bowl, especially since
the Giants have been relaxing at the
beach since the middle of December.
