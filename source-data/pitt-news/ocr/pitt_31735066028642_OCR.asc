Pitt student rapecl an Cathedral Lawn

 

By Jackie Duggan
News Editor

The date began in front of the William
Pitt Union, where two Pitt students
agreed to go the the Panther Hollow Inn
for a few drinks.

A young woman says it ended after her
date raped her on the Cathedral Lawn.

On Nov. 3, shortly after leaving the
Panther Hollow Inn, located on Forbes
Avenue near the Carnegie Mellon
University campus, a female student was
sexually assaulted by a male she
described as being a casual acquaintance.

The woman said she knew the male
from a small campus-sponsored organi-
zation where both attended meetings. It
was at one of the meetings that he had

asked the woman to go on a date.

She filed a complaint with Pitt Police
on Nov. 18, and so far police have not
been able to reach the male student for
questioning.

“All we have is the victim’s account of
the assault,” said Rick Boyd, Pitt Police
Chief. “The student went away for break
and as of yesterday, was not back in his
room.” .

Boyd said that while attempts to locate
the suspecthave been unsuccesful, he
belives they will bring him in within a
matter of days.

The assault occurred around 2 a.m.
when the couple was walking back to the
union, where the victim was going to
catch a shuttle bus home. _

As the two approached the courtyard

on the Forbes Avenue side of the

Cathedral, the woman said the male ,

began to “force himself’ on the her, and
that’s when the rape occurred.

The woman did indicate that the area
was well lit, but no one was nearby to
help. She suffered minor physical
injuries with scrapes and abrasions on
her arms and bruises on the back of her
head.

“Both students are over 21 and had
consumed a significant amount of alco-
hol,” Boyd said.

The two students left the bar near clos-
ing time after splitting three pitchers of
been

“We have no reason not to believe
her,” Boyd said. “I emphasize that we
have not talked with the suspect yet.”

Pitt Meclical Center gets over $12 million

Cancer center
receives $7 .7
million  

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer

The National Cancer
Institute has awarded the
University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute a grant for
more than $7.7 million, plac-
ing it among the nation’s elite
cancer centers.

The money from the grant,
referred to as an NCI cancer
center support grant, will be
given to the university over a
span of four years. The funds
will_be used to enhance the
research infrastructure of the
UPCI, providing funding to

support facilities for laborato-
ry, clinical, education and
prevention programs.

“The grant reinforces our
standing as a major scientific
institution in the national
cancer research community
and allows us to continue
providing innovative
approaches to cancer care for
patients,” said Ronald
Herberman, director of the
UPCI and associate vice
chancellor for research,
Health Sciences.

The funds from the grant
are allocated according to a
proposal submitted to the
NCI.

According to Jules Heisler,
associate director of adminis-
tration at the UPCI, the grant
will be used primarily for
research facilities. It will also
provide funding for the lead-

Alternatives
for heart

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer

The University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center
has received $4.8 million
from the National Institutes
of Health to develop an
innovative blood pump that
will serve as a low—cost
alternative to heart trans-
plantation.

UPMC and Nimbus. lnc.. a
medical device research and
development firm in Rancho
Cordova. Calif.. were award-
ed the five-year NIH con-
tract to produce an advanced

artificial heart assist device.
.The contract involves the
development of a system
which will use an implanted
rotary blood pump. similar
to a turbine. to help patients
with end-stage heart disease
— a cardiac condition for
which the main treatment
currently available is heart
transplantation.

This device. which repre-
sents the state of the art in
circulatory support. will be
applicable to a broader range
of patients. said Bartley
Griffith, chief of cardiotho—
racic surgery at the UPMC
and co-principal investigator
in the contract.

While there are 40.000 to
50.000 patients who need
heart transplants. only about
2.500 people receive them
each year.

OTTAWA — In order to prevent
Canada's unity from crumbling,
Canadian Minister Jean Chretien
announced yesterday three mea-
sures aimed at stopping French-
speaking Quebec from leaving
the rest of the country.

Chretien made his proposals at
a hastily prepared news confer-
ence arranged to defend himself
from blistering attacks both in
Parliament and in the nation’s
media for not moving soon after
separatists nearly won a sover-
eignty referendum on Oct. 30.

He said he introduced a motion

ST. GALLEN, Switzerland -
Decades after losing his job for
forging documents to save sever-
al thousand Jews from Nazi ter-
ror, a state police chief who died
in disgrace will get a new hear-
ing.
The St; Gallen district court
yesterday ordered an immediate
retrial for Paul Grueninger, who
was found guilty 55 years ago of
“activities inconsistent with his
position.” The court will decide
tomorrow whether he will
receive a full pardon.

Grueninger, former comman-

 

der of the St. Gallen police, was
charged in 1940 for forging
immigration documents to allow
Austrian Jews to evade tight
Swiss visa restrictions after Hitler
annexed Austria. He is believed
to have saved 3,000 Jews from
death in concentration camps. He
died in poverty in 1972.

million refugees don’t return to
Rwanda, four African leaders and
former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter are joining forces to ﬁgure

The five-day summit, which
began yesterday, is the first
regional gathering on the
Rwandan crisis, which began last
year with the genocidal ethnic
war that killed more than 500,000
people.

In a development sure to

WASHINGTON —— Asking
Americans to “choose peace” not
war, President Clinton told a
doubtful nation Monday night

that he will assume full responsi-
bility for the fate of 20,000 troops
he wants to send to Bosnia to
secure peace.

The president’s message has
begun to soften opposition in the
Republican Congress.

Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole (R-Kan.) said, ‘‘I want to
ﬁnd a way, if it’s possible, to sup-
port the president. He hasn’t
made the case yet. But he’s start-
ed.”

Dole also said that the troops
will head to Bosnia despite any
opposition, saying he believes
Clinton possesses the constitu-
tional authority to dispatch the
troops. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

Myth: Most students have
an acute awareness of
their own sexual desires
and limits.

Fact: When speaking with
students, especially youn-
ger students, about sexual
assault related issues, it
becomes apparent that
many of them have not
concluded with‘ any
degree of certainty who
they are as sexual human
beings. They may be able
to state what their politi-
cal beliefs and aspirations
are, but many will falter
when discussing or even
thinking about their own
sexuality and sexual
wants and limits. The dan-
ger in “not knowing” is
that, when a decision has
to be made and sometimes
all too quickly, it may be

' made by someone else.

Arriving at this major
decision in a matter of
seconds requires sorting

Sexuality raises
questions for students

 

through messages
received from powerful,
influential sources since
childhood. These mes-
sages come from parents,
religion, peers, the media,
teachers, etc.
Unfortunately, the mes-
sages received may con-
flict with one another.
Therefore, when a deci-
sion needs to be made
quickly, sometimes with
passions flaring, all theses
conflicting messages will
surface simultaneously,
creating feelings of confu-
sion and panic. The result
may be that no decision is
made.

Some male students
have been told by their
fathers it'is OK to have
sex; “just don’t get
caught.” At the same time,
they were hearing from

religion was teaching
them that premarital sex is
“wrong,” while their male
peers were saying, “Did

you get it last night?” The
media was selling them the
message that “the more you
score, the more of a man
you are,” while their female
peers were telling them to
respect women and that
“real men don’t need to
score.”

Some female students
report being told nothing by
their fathers, while others
heard from their fathers,
“Men only want one thing
from you.” Some women
heard from their mothers:

 

“Some male students have been told by

their fathers it is OK to have sex; ‘just

don’t get caught."’

—Mary Koch Ruiz

Sexual Assaults Services Coordinator

“Men don’t marry women
who do it.” Others were
told by their mothers, ‘‘If
you’re going to have sex,
make sure you use birth
control.” Women report
hearing from their male

peers, “If he doesn’t respect
you, just let me know.”
They hear from some of
their female peers, “If it
feels right, then it’s okay,”
while other female peers
respond with, “If he’s will-

ing to wait, then he really
loves you.”
Many women report hear-

ing from their religion that

sex before marriage is sin-
ful while the media is
encouraging these same
women to use their bodies
rather than their minds to
attract men. It is no wonder
why young adults, men and
women, have many ques-
tions but few answers
regarding sexual relation-
ships. They seem to receive
opinions which are conflict-
ual at best, but they receive

relatively "little guidance or
understanding.

Men and women‘ need to
define within themselves
what is of importance and
value to them. With a strong

sense of personal clarity‘

and conviction, they will
feel free to be themselves
and will not tolerate ambi-
guity or pressure from any-
one in any kind of relation-
ship.

Nuclear. materials hot property  

By Paul Kogut
Staﬂ’ Writer

“You could make an argument that the safest
place for nuclear material is on the top of a mis-
sile,” said Phil Williams, leaning back in his
‘chair, stroking his beard and chuckling ner-
vously.

His friend and research associate, Paul N.
Woessner, laughed as well.

“That’s a great conclusion,” Woessner said,
nodding to Williams. 7

But both Williams and Woessner know that
the subject at hand, nuclear material traificking,
is no joke, and their 18-page study on the sub-
ject complete with two appendices conveys that
idea. In fact, their message is one of urgency.

Since the end of the Cold War, the chance
that the Russians will use their nuclear missiles
has diminished considerably.

But thieves are finding it relatively easy to
steal nuclear materials such as cesium, plutoni-
um and uranium from laboratories in Russia
and other parts of the former Soviet Union.
Smugglers then leak it out of the country,
sometimes into the hands of terrorists, Williams
said.

Williams is the director of the Matthew B.
Ridgway Center for International Security
Studies, which is the focal point at Pitt for
research on national and international security
issues.

In their paper, “Nuclear” Material Trafﬁcking:
An Interim Assessment,” Williams and
Woessner explored the black market in nuclear
materials and gathered 149 cases of nuclear
smuggling that occurred between Oct. 15,
1991, and Dec. 15, 1994, into one list.

All of the cases in the study are the result of
arrests, the majority of which took place in
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

How many smuggling operations go undetect-
ed is anybody’s guess, but Williams estimates
the percentage at around 50.

In addition, most of the smugglers who have
been arrested have been amateurs. That’s not a
good sign.

“We’re saying, ‘Hey look — when amateurs
can get a hold of weapons-grade material as the
three in Munich did, that suggests that you have
a real problem,’’’ Williams said.

Williams was referring to the case that result-
ed in the arrest of a Columbian and two
Spaniards on Aug. 10, 1994. German police
captured the three men at the Munich airport
and seized about 300 grams of weapons-grade.
plutonium-239. They also found 1 kilogram of
lithium in their luggage, which was stored in a
cookie tin.

That’s just one of the many bizarre cases .
involving amateurs that VV1lliams and Woessner
have run across. Another involves a Pole who
kept cesium in his shirt pocket and later died
from radioactivity poisoning. In another, a
butcher living in St. Petersburg, Russia, kept
uranium in his refrigerator in a pickle jar.

None of the cases, collected from open
sources, occurred in the United States, and
there was only one case that may have involved
Americans, Woessner said.

Even though most of the material being
smuggled could not be used to build a bomb, it y
is still highly dangerous.

“If a criminal organization got a hold of
nuclear material, then they could threaten a city,
corporation or country with some kind of
release into the atmosphere or water supply,”
Williams said.

The message of the study is this: “The prob-
lem is not under control and  previous efforts
to deter or disrupt the nuclear trade has not suc-
ceeded,” the paper says.

Jesus was a person too

When you are planning your term papers next week, you better
be careful how you choose your topic. The Supreme Court recent-
ly declined to hear the appeal of a girl in Tennessee who claims
that in ninth grade her paper was given a zero even though she
filled all the requirements in writing it.

The teacher’s reason for failing the paper was not poor writing,
bad grammar or- spelling, or even plagiarism. No, no, her crime
was far worse. When asked to write a paper about the life of some
person in history, Brittney Settle wrote her paper about Jesus
Christ. When she first suggested the topic to her teacher, the
teacher rejected the idea. The rejection was based on the grounds
that “the girl’s strong Christian beliefs and deep knowledge of the
subject would make it difficult for her to approach the topic in a
scholarly way  (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Nov. 28.) According
to this logic, if you are an American, you carmot write a paper
about George Washington because you will obviously be biased
in his favor. And if you are Jewish, you are not allowed to write a
paper about Hitler, Nazis or Germany in general because you will
obviously be biased against them. Or  you get the point.

Settle challenged the grade on the grounds of discrimination
against religious speech. She had been given an assignment, and
she completed it using four sources as she was supposed to. Just

' because the person she chose to write about was a religious fig-

ure, she was failed. Let that be a lesson to anyone who was con-
sidering a term paper about one of the popes, a saint, Martin
Luther or practically any writer from before the 10th century.
(The majority of them wrote on religious themes and many were
members of the church.) 0

Settle’s teacher apparently saw no value in studying the life of
someone whom many believe was the son of God. Whether or not
you believe in Christ as a savior is not important here. Few people
deny that a person named Jesus lived around 2000 years ago. The
teacher separated herself from the church/state argument by say-
ing that “people don’t send their children to school for a teacher
to get in a dialogue with personal religious beliefs.” (The New
York limes, Nov. 28.) Settle’s paper was not intended to be deliv-

ered to other students in her class as a lesson for the day. Nor was
r it at all relevant for the teacher to get into a dialogue over reli-

gious beliefs. If the paper was well written, citing four legitimate
sources, the teacher’s beliefs should never have been an issue.

The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear this case is a tragedy. This
was not an issue of scholarly ability, it was a teacher’s decision
that she didn’t want anyone writing anything religious in her
classroom. It gives teachers ‘free reign to deny any paper on the
grounds of personal belief.

So when you are writing your term papers over the next few
weeks, know what your teachers believe in and what they don’t.
You never know when one will disagree with what you write and
fail you. And the Supreme Court apparently isn’t going to back
you up.

Is Newt Gingrich an Intellectual?

Is the Speaker of the House
the intellectual he claims to
be? Newt Gingrich seems to
think so, and to prove it he has
written a book called “To
Renew America,” a 260-page
manifesto that outlines
Gingrich’s vision for America.
But does it prove him to be
the intellectual ‘he claims him-
self to be? After foolishly
spending $24.95 (not includ-
ing the ‘seven percent sales
tax) on this waste of time,
money and brain cells, I came
to the following conclusion:

No way. '

“To Renew America” is
mostly a regurgitation of his
standard stump speech: since
1965 unnamedelite counter-
cultural liberals have devastat-
ed America with their evil
plans to tear down mainstream
society, and the future will be
wonderful and great as long as
conservatives are allowed to
cut the money the government
sends to programs like
Medicare and Medicaid. The
book itself is a sort of extend-
ed version of the college
course he was teaching at
Reinhardt College in Georgia.
If this is really a “college
course,” then Gingrich, who
has on many occasions
accused liberals of ruining
college academic standards,
owes quite a few people an
apology.

“To Renew America” is full
of plugs for political support-
ers like Roger Milliken, the
president of America’s leading
textile firm, whom Gingrich
credits with a “corporate cul-
ture” in which junior execu-
tives challenge the boss. Of
course, the real reason the
Milliken Corporation does so
well is because America’s tex-
tile industry is heavily protect-
ed by the federal government,
and Milliken pays good
money to make sure Gingrich
and Co. keep it that way. For
reasons I cannot begin to fath-
om, Gingrich neglects to men-
tion all of the money Milliken
gives him in his book.

Michael
Berquist

Gingrich laughably indulges
in his sci—fi side often, taking
to task bureaucracies using
sci-fi. He writes, “One of the
major reasons the spirit of
adventure has gone out of
space exploration is that we
have allowed bureaucracies to
dominate too many of our sci-
entific adventures. Look at the
difference between the movies
The Right Stuff and Star Wars
and you will see what I
mean.” As I read that, I won-
dered if Gingrich realized that
science—fiction is called that
because it is fiction. Star
Wars, while being a fantastic
trilogy of movies, never hap-
pened “long ago in a galaxy
far, far away.” I hope someone
will tell him this and tell him
soon.

Gingrich plods on:
“Bureaucracies are designed
to minimize risk and create
orderly systematic procedures.
In a way [bureaucracies] tend
to be inherently dull.” What is
Newt saying? That he would
prefer exciting bureaucracies
instead? Is that why he is slic-
ing Medicare, Medicaid and
welfare? They aren’t thrilling
enough? Is Gingrich’s entire
political philosophy based on
excitement?

One particularly humorous
section of “To Renew
America” dealt with
Gingrich’s desire to build a
real Jurassic Park and bring
back the dinosaurs (an idea
columnist Michael Kinsley
derided as being “the ultimate
conservative agenda”). At this
point I nearly fell out of the
chair laughing at the supreme
idiocy of Gingrich’s ideas.
Scientists, who unlike
Gingrich must contend with
the inconvenient problem of
reality, have mostly dismissed
Jurassic Park as an impossibil-
ity (or at least for the
moment). Perhaps Gingrich
should take the time to look

up the words “fiction” and
“nonfiction” in the dictionary.
Learning the distinction
between the two words might
come in useful in his next
speech.

The rest of “To Renew
America” is full of Reagan-
style anecdotes. Reagan him-
self used inflated stories of
“welfare queens” (stories that
were proven false, even after
Reagan used them time and
time again in his speeches) to
avoid having to resort to facts,
and Gingrich proves himself
to be a worthy heir to “The
Great Communicator” in that
respect. For example.
Gingrich attacks gun-control
advocates by telling us this
amusing tidbit: “In Israel it is
common on weekends to see
young people walking around
Jerusalem or Tel Aviv with
Uzis at their sides  Far from
making people feel insecure,
the sight of weapons actually
makes people feel safer.”
What is Gingrich saying? That
if we all carried guns we’d all
be safer? Somehow if I saw an
individual walking down the
street here in Pittsburgh carry-
ing an Uzi, I’d be terrified,
even if I possessed a weapon
myself. What is very disturb-
ing about Gingrich’s thinking
is that he passes off value
judgements like these without
the proof to back them up.

The Speaker isn’t the pro-
found thinker he seems to
think he is. Gingrich apparent-
ly thought that To Renew
America would show him to
be a latter—day Jeffersonian
politician-intellectual, but the
book reveals him to be a sec-
ond-rate politician and ideo-
logue. Gingrich seems to think
of himself as a revolutionary
with new concepts about gov-
ernment, but his ideas are little
more than old ideas cynically
repackaged to exploit the
mood of a deeply distrustful
nation.

and Mark Gordon Ohio State. The next game for the . 1   
v The PittNews Pitt is tonight against the 

The Pitt football team finished off its most dismal sea-
son in almost 25 ‘years Friday, just as it approaches the
20th anniversary of its undefeated national championship
season.

The Panthers were blanked, 21-0, in the Backyard
Brawl against West Virginia in Morgantown and closed
out the season with nine straight losses, ﬁnishing 2-9.

Less than 40,000 fans were in attendance at
Mountaineer Field for a rematch of what was one of the
best games of the season last year.

In that game, the Mountaineers beat the Panthers 47-41
in a contest that saw numerous lead changes, blocked
punts and ﬁeld goals, interceptions returned for touch-
downs and a last—second score that sealed it for West
Virginia. ‘

This year’s brawl, broadcast on ESPN, did not have
nearly as much excitement. West Virginia capitalized on
many Pitt mistakes as it rolled to the shutout.

For the Panthers, the lone offensive star was fullback
Chris Schneider. He rushed for 86 yards on 22 caries and
caught nine passes for 27 yards.

Freshman quarterback Matt Lytle made his second
straight start in place of injured Pete Gonzalez and com-
pleted l7 of 29 passes for 99 yards, and senior wideout
Dietrich Jells ended his Pitt career with three receptions
for 35 yards.

Despite the last-place ﬁnish, the Panthers managed to
secure four spots on the Football News All-Big East
Team. Jells, linebacker Tom Tumulty, punter Nate
Cochran and freshman kicker Chris Ferencik were all
selected, giving Pitt, along with Rutgers, the second most
in the conference, behind the co-conference champion
Virginia Tech Hokies.

Also in the past week in Pitt sports:

the Panther’s points. '

But it was not enough to slow down the Cavaliers.

Sophomore forward Monick Foote led all scorers with a
career high 27 points, picking up 18 on six-for-six three-
point shooting. Right behind her was Wendy Palmer, who
scored 25 points and had 10 rebounds.

Two keys to Pitt’s 16-point victory over a team that
recently beat the Massachusetts Minutemen were 15 of 18

°The Pitt Panther wrestling team opened its 1995-96
season by competing in the Mat-Town USA wrestling
tournament at Lock Haven last Saturday and placing
fourth out of 12 teams.

Placing ahead of the Panthers were (in order): Penn St.
with 159.5 points, host Lock Haven with 126.5 points and

behind with 115.5 points. Other powers such as North
Carolina St. and Bucknell grappled as well.

Pitt had eight wrestlers take eighth place or higher, high-
lighted by two ﬁrst-place finishes and two second-place
ﬁnishes. ‘

J .J . Fasnacht, continuing his dominance at 142 pounds,
took ﬁrst place in his weight class. Mark Bodo, at 190
pounds, took first place as well. Both wrestlers won their
ﬁnal matches by decision.

Bryan Matusic and heavyweight Pat Wiltanger brought

the second-place finishes home. “Luscious” Larry

U/fra-quick point

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor ,

When the Pitt Panther basketball team
practices, a point guard affectionately
referred to as “Ice” doesn’t get caught up in
all the talking. In fact, he hardly says a
word.

Returning from a serious knee injury that
sidelined him for the entire season last
year. Pitt point guard Jerry McCullough
intends to lead Pitt’s young, freshman-
laden team into the NCAA.toumament by
example.

“I think the team looks at me as a leader,
and so do the coaches,” McCullough said.
“I don’t like to talk or get emotional out
there. That’s just not my style.”

Pitt head coach Ralph Willard would like
McCullough’s style to be more vocal. But
the Sunday before Thanksgiving,
McCullough became too vocal at practice.

Apparently fed up with Willard’s fierce
style of practice, McCullough erupted at
the coaching staff and the players. Willard
subsequently “suspended” McCullough
from the team.

The following day, Willard allowed
McCullough to return to practice with sepa-
rate apologies for the coaching staff and the

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 29, 1995

players. In fact, he called a separate play-
ers’ meeting for that apology.

“I have to step up and lead this team, and
"getting the guys together and apologizing
was something I had to do.” McCullough
said.

With that incident behind the team, the I N

sophomore form, when he was selected as   .. 
one of 25 finalists for the United States 1 '6
Basketball Writers Association’s Player of :
the Year Award.

McCullough’s left knee, injured in a 
pick—up game before the beginning of last ,
season, is stronger than ever. A

Willard said, “His knee is great. His knee .
is 100 percent. His knee is actually stronger
than what God gave him. He hasn’t lost 
anything in quickness." ’ if

The crafty passer, who needs only 14
steals to move past Carlton Neverson as _
Pitt’s all-time steal leader with_l95, had ,_  .
reconstructive surgery on Oct. 7, 1994. A V
ligament taken from a cadaver was placed .6 ’
inside his knee, but McCullough credits 
hard work in rehab for his recovery. ‘

“It’s the weights,” McCullough said. “I
built up the muscle. It’s way stronger.”

McCullough’s knee needs to be stronger
to adapt to Willard’s run-and—gun, full—  ’
court press style.

“He’s almost in the same boat as the
freshmen right now, in terms of learning
how to play hard all the time,” Willard
said. »

“I’ve watched films of him from years
past, and he would play hard, and then he . ........ .. ~ - 
would be just out there. The way We Play: in  
you can’t do that.”

McCullough has accumulated 1,006" Jim Madvstaffphotogmpher
points in his pm Career and is only the SEN. Senior point guard Jerry McCullough scored 25 points, grabbed five
boards and had ﬁve assists against the Converse AAU last Saturday night.

One of the nation’s top recruit-
ing classes makes its way to Pitt
this season, with six freshmen
hoping to crack the lineup and
help the Panthers improve on
last year’s 10-18 record.

Leading the recruiting class is
Vonteego Cummings, a 6—foot-
3-inch point guard out of
Thomson, Ga. Ranked in the top
20 by some recruiting services,
Cummings was the ﬁrst member
of his class to commit to the
Panthers last off-season.

Assistant coach S_ean Cleary
said that Cummings possesses
“tremendous athletic skills” and
has been the most energetic of
the freshman in practice.

Kellii Taylor also hopes to see
some time in the backcourt in
his first season with Pitt. Taylor

‘ transfered to Pittsburgh from

Maine Central Institute, the
same prep school that produced
last year’s standout center Jaime
Peterson.

Initially pegged as a member
of last year’s Panther lineup,
Taylor’s season at MCI resulted
in a team-high 19.4 points per
game and a chance at quality
minutes with the Panthers this
season.

In only eight minutes against
the Melbourne Tigers in an exhi-
bition game earlier this season,

 __ Taylor registered ﬁve points and
‘-. one assist, equaling teammate

Cummings’ performance for the
evening.

around the country, the classroom
is like the plague.

Here are some disturbing num-
bers regarding graduation rates
between 1985 and 1988.

Consider National Champion
UCLA, a rich tradition and solid
perennial power. Coach of the
Year Jim Harrick works his play-
ers hard and it pays off  on the
court. The Bruins graduate only
25% of their players.

Nolan Richardson and the

H-5

should major in hoops

Hogs in Arkansas put up a fight-
with the Bruins last year but
could not repeat. They were prob-
ably just thinking about how they
could better their 31% graduation
rate.

What about Rick Pitino down
in bluegrass land? The Wildcats
are even worse than the Bruins at
21%. Roy Williams and Kansas _
are pressuring Pitino and Co. for
the No. 1 spot this year, but they
should focus on jacking up their
30% showing.

There aresome bright spots
around the country when it comes
to players walking up the get their
diplomas. Georgetown graduates
around 86%, Virginia 83%, and
82% of Dean Smith’s Tarheels
ﬁnish their degrees. '

For a handful of coaches who
stress ﬁnals as much as jumpers,
there are still too many like Jim
Boeheirn with 21% at Syracuse
and Bob Huggins of Cincinatti,
who fashions caps and gowns for

only 19% of his hoopsters.

One of the factors coming into
play is the money. What does a
talented kid think when the big
contracts are on the table? This is
just another pressure that they
can’t handle. The obvious step is
to go for the fame and fortune of
the pros, and, honestly, who can
blame them? I’d do it. and you
would, too. -

What can be done to encourage
these kids to stay in school?
Unfortunately, there is not very
much that can be done. Coaches
can make sure players go to class,
but they can’t do their homework
for them. At least, not all the
time.

I’ve come up with an idea.
Maybe not a great idea, but it’s
still an idea. Have these players
major in basketball —— it’s that
easy.

Every major has its require-
ments, and this one would be no

Villcmovo is The Pitt
News’ choice to

dethrone Connecticut

os Big East champion

The Villanova Wildcats are in a position that they are not
very familiar with — being ranked in the preseason.

The ‘Cats are No. 1 in The Pitt News Big East poll and as
high as No. 2 in some national polls, so they
will not be trying on any Cinderella slippers
this year.

But they will be trying on rings when
March Madness rolls around. Last year
the Big East champs got stunned -in the
first round of the tournament, but not this

 

yean

Coach Steve Lappas returns four of his starters, including
Big East Player of the Year Kerry Kittles and three—point
shooting guru Eric Eberz.

Last year Kittles did everything but drive the team bus,
averaging 21.4 points a game, 6.1 rebounds, 3.5 assists and
2.2 steals. Eberz led the Big East with an average of 2.85
threes a game, and his .470 mark from long range was also
No. 1.

Center Jason Lawson is back in the middle, and the 6-11
junior can play with any big man in the league. Gutsy for-
ward Chuck Kornegay and defensive whiz Zeffy Penn also
are returning to the lineup.

If that’s not enough for Lappas and ‘Nova to wreak havoc
in the NCAA, the top freshman is a 7-1 giant from Poland,
Rafal Bigus. The ‘Cats deserve the ranking, and every team
in the conference will be gunning for them.

John Thompson returns to the hardwood for his 24th year
as the head coach at Georgetown and hopes to take the
Hoyas to their 15th straight NCAA tourney appearance.

The Hoyas lost four seniors to graduation — Don Reid,
John Jacques, Kevin Millen and Irvin
Church. However, Thompson does have
three returning starters from last year’s
team, which went 21-10 and advanced to
the Sweet 16 before losing to North
Carolina.

Othella Harrington and Jerome
Williams return to give the Hoyas size and experience under-
neath. In ‘94-’95 Harrington, a first-team All-Big East selec-
tion, averaged 12.2 points and 6 boards per game. Williams
looks to improve on last season’s 10.9 points and 10
rebounds. . .

The main man, however, will be last year’s consensus Big
East Newcomer of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year,
Allen Iverson. He led the team in scoring (20.4), steals (89)
and assists (134).

All three players played on the USA Team for the World
University games this summer in Japan.

Also returning from last year are sophomores J ahidi White,
Jerry Nichols and Boubacar Aw. New faces for Thompson
include Godwin Owinje (6-8, 205), who averaged 24.5 points
at Bismarck State Junior College last year. He will be joined
by freshmen Jameel Watkins (6-10, 244), 6-4 Daymond
Jackson, 6-3 Victor Page and 6-2 Joseph Touomou.

Some might say Kirk Bruce was born to
be a basketball coach.

But that’s only partially true. He was
actually born to be a Pitt basketball coach.

Anybody who has followed Pitt hoops
over the past 25 years knows that. They
already know Bruce is a true Pitt man,
having starred on the men’s team in the
early ‘70s and currently guiding the
women’s team towards national promi-
nence.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 29, 1995

Bruce, 42, is entering his 11th season at
the helm of the Lady Panthers. His ﬁrst
four years were losing seasons, plagued
with false hopes and injuries. But ﬁve out
of the past six years have seen winning
records, culminating with a third-place
finish in the 1994 National Women’s
Invitational Tournament.

“He’s a Pitt guy, through and through,”
says assistant coach Larry Anderson, who
is going on his third season with the Lady
Panthers. “He might even bleed blue and
gold.”

Bruce was a star baseball and basketball
player at local South Hills High School
and enrolled at Pitt in 1972. He was a key
player for legendary coach Buzz Ridl, and
in his junior year he helped the Panthers
to a 25-4 season that landed them in the
final eight of the NCAA Tournament.

During that season, Bruce was over-

shadowed by second team All-American 9

Billy Knight, but his senior year he was
the Panthers’ go—to guy, averaging 17.1
points a game. The 6—foot-6-inch slender,
athletic guard ﬁnished his Panther career
in the top 10 Pitt list in assists and was

-l-‘brmer men’s star works the sideline for Lady Panthers

drafted by the Utah Stars of the American

Basketball Association.

“The best thing about that was just
being drafted and getting a signing
bonus,” Bruce says. -

This was in addition to playing with a
19-year-old kid named Moses Malone
and against Hall of Famer Julius Erving.

“Moses was just like a high school kid.”
Bruce remembers. “But even then he was
a tremendous offensive rebounder.”

One of Bruce’s favorite Malone stories
is about when the 6-10 center had a flat
tire and was going to be late for practice.
Malone didn’t want to waste time fixing
the tire, so he called the dealer, who
promptly brought over a new car for his
customer. —

Although his pro career did not last too
long, Bruce gained valuable experience
concerning the strategies of the game and
fostered what many believe.to be his top
quality as a coach — optimism.

Bruce never harps on what could have
been or the unfairness of life. And he
knows a lot about hardships; his father

Petho: From Down Under to on top

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

For her freshman proﬁle in the
women’s basketball media guide in
1992, Stephanie Petho was asked
where_ she wanted to visit one day.
She said Australia.

Three years later, Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce chose her to join the
Big East/Nike Women’s All—Star
Team, where she would play five
games in two weeks against
Australian teams.

Petho recalls how, after the ﬁnal
game of last season, Bruce
informed her about the trip over-
seas.

“He came up to me and said,
‘Hey, what do you think about
Australia?’ I had no idea what he
was talking about, and I said, ‘Oh,
that would be great. I want to go
there some day.’ He said, ‘How
would you like to go [this sum-
mer]?”’

Bruce felt Petho’s trip to‘

Australia would give her added
confidence and leadership ability,
and he was right. Now a senior,
Petho ‘is captain of the Lady
Panthers and is their leading .
scorer.

The Big East team, comprised
of one player from each confer-
ence team, ﬁnished its Australian .
tour with a 2-3 record. Petho, a

1 5-foot-9-inch guard, scored 44

points and had 10 rebounds in
the ﬁve games, while contribut-
ing l0 points in the team’s final-
game against the Ipswich Eagles.
Petho said their opponents

were bigger, faster and stronger

and even had a little home-court
advantage.

“There was a lot of referee
bias,” she said. “We learned a
lot, and sometimes you need
that. You need to get your butt
kicked every once in a while.”

Being chosen to play in the
Big East team and receiving the
opportunity to travel overseas

‘shows what Petho has accom-

plished since her freshman sea-
son. According to Bruce, her
freshman season passed Petho
by without her noticing it.

“She didn’t come in ready to

9 p1ay,” Bruce said. “For a lot of

freshmen, the year just kind of
goes by them very quickly. That
was really the case with
Stephanie.”

At St. John Central High
School in Bellaire, Ohio, Petho
averaged 35.9 points per game
and was named first-team AP
and UPI All-State as a senior, so
it was a shock to score only nine
points her whole freshman sea-
son at Pitt. She only played in 12
games. -

“I wasn’t prepared at all,”
Petho said. “I was out of shape
and had no idea what to expect
It’s such a different game than in
high school, because it’s so
much more physical and faster
paced. You either have to be
ready, or you’re going to get left
in the dust, and I kinda got left in
the dust.”

Petho forgot about her fresh-
man season just as quickly as it
passed by her. During the Off-
season, she ran, played in sum-
mer leagues and worked out

with her brother, Eric.

“Pre—seas0n is so much easier if
you’re ready,” _PethO said.
“Sometimes the freshmen come in,
and it’s agony for a month. But I
think a lot of it in college is condi-
tioning, because there’s no time for
rest.” '

The Australian experience
helped in this area as well. Petho
said thatsince the trip was in the
middle of summer, she used the
games as a gauge as to how well
conditioned she was. It gave her an
idea of how much work she had to
do when she got back.

As a sophomore, Bruce used
Petho exclusively off the bench.
She scored in double digits four
times, including 15 points in a 90-
72 victory over Providence. She
led the Lady Panthers in free-throw
percentage with 89 percent, mak-
ing 54 of 61 attempts.

“She’s a hard worker,” Bruce
said. “We saw her play when we
were recruiting her, and she could
put the ball in the basket. She

scored over 30 points a game, and

it was very effortless the way she

    

H-9

When she was being recruited,
Petho visited Syracuse and West
Virginia before she made her last
visit, which was to Pitt. She origi-
nally had two other trips plarmed
but cancelled them.

She said the recruiting process
was “very stressful and anxiety rid-
den,” and she made it a point to
sign early. She also wanted to stay
fairly close to home.

“My parents played such a big
role up until this point of my life,”
Petho said. “I thought it was only
fair that they get to come to most
of the games here.”

They were beside her when
Bruce told Petho she was his
choice for the Big East team.

After not starting a game in her
ﬁrst two seasons, Petho started all
28 games last year as a junior,
averaging 12.8 points and 4.4
rebounds per game.

She scored a career-high 29
points in an 80-71 victory over
Georgetown. She led the team with
25 points in a 73-67 win against St.
John’s in the quarterfinals of the

is keyito Panthers’ hig

I By. Sean Duncan
Mariagirig Editor

Somehow. some way, Ralph Willard prevented
Pitt basketball’s ship from capsizing last season.
Shackled to a bench that limited the then first-year
head coach to eight scholarship players, two team
‘managers. a football punter and three walk-ons -

moments of hope were few and far between in a

surprisingly positive 10-18 season.

But Willard and crew persevered the turbulent
ride, primarily because he knew help was on its
way. Lots and lots of help. ~

Willard’s‘ S.O.S. calls have been answered in a
big “way this season. And now when he scrolls
down his bench, he’ll find his sterling freshmen
class, talented transfers, key veterans and, most

. importantly, the return of Pitt’s dynamic floor gen-
- feral, Jerry McCullough.

V “We have depth at every position,” Willard said.
~_ _“It’s great. That’s the way you want to coach,
because dealing with people with this level of
. ‘experience, people are going to have bad nights.

 Now we have options.”

’ i _ ’With talent that can go 12 deep on any night,
 coupled with the fact that many don’t expect Pitt
‘ to make any waves in an already loaded confer-
 ence, the Panthers could be primed to give a pis-
. tol-whipping to snoozing Big East competition.

“That’s to our advantage,” said forward Chad
 Varga about the lack of expectations. “People

. I assume we’re going to be down again, and it’s our

 job to prove them wrong. And hopefully we can
: do that."
' of . Pitt’s success rides on .how quickly the freshmen
 ‘grasp Willard’s high-octane, trapping defensive
7 schemes, which in turn creates its fast-paced,
7 three-point bombing offense. Willard said the ﬁve
, freshmen have progressively ‘gotten better offen-
_ sively, but have had problems keeping up with
 Willard’s hectic defensive style of play.
. A “How good we’ll get depends on how quick the
:.freshr'n"en grasp the philosophy and learn how to
 play through fatigue,” Willard said. “That’s the
biggest problem with the freshmen right now: they
i have to learn how to play through fatigue.
Physically they’re in good shape, but mentally
" they’re fatigued and they fall off a cliff.
“Offensively, they’re going to score. That’s not a
p problem. The biggest problem is defensively.
2 They’re having problems guarding people.”
j . The freshmen class, which is ranked as the third
best class in the nation by Hoop Scoop magazine
and the Sporting News,'has a balanced attack at
every position. Vonteego Cummings, a 6—foot-4-
.- inch combo-guard from Thomson, Ga., is consid-
ered to be the linchpin of the group. Listed as one
of the top 10 guards in the country last year,

Cummings averaged 25 points, 6.8 rebounds and
2 ﬁve assists in his senior campaign. Kellii Taylor,
another multi-dimensional guard, signed with Pitt
Vin ‘94, but he didn’t meet the NCAA requirements
"and enrolled at Maine Central Prep school, where

he led the team in scoring with a 19.4 average.

_ Andre Howard, a strong rebounding 6-8 for-
._ ward; Michael Gill, a heady 6-7 forward who was
also ranked as a top 25 prospect; and Mark Blount
 round out the class. Blount, a 7-foot center, brings
' ‘size to a genuinely small Pitt team.

 “The freshmen bring in an-attitude of competi-
 tiveness,” senior guard/forward Garrick Thomas
 said. “They want to take your spot, and you want
 to keep your spot everyday at practice.”
Experience is something the Panthers seriously
‘ lack Pitt has four seniors, and only three of them
' ‘played last season (McCullough sat out last year
 with an injury). Additionally, only four players
" from last year’s squad have any game experience,
and even that number should have an asterisk by
_'it. Varga, a 6-6 forward, played in only 10 games,
 and in a handful of them he wasn’t at 100 percent.
"  The‘ few survivors from last season’s squad are
point guard Andre Alridge, shooting guard Jason
Maile, Thomas and Varga.
, . “We have so many question marks coming into"
' his year, because we have a lot of guys who have
alent but haven’t played,” Willard said.
  Despite Pitt’s lack of experience, there’s one fact
" hat can’t be overlooked: the Panthers have a log-
 am of talent. With a bench that can go 12 deep,

h-octane attack

Willard has the option to play a variety of combi-
nations, ranging from a three-guard set to two cen-
ters and even to a four-guard offense. That’s a lux-
ury Willard couldn’t afford last year, and, as a
result, Willard had to scrap his full-court pressing
style of play and revert to gimmick defenses.

“I think we’ll go 10 deep most nights with sig-
nificant minutes, but it might be a different 10,”
Willard said. “It all depends on who we’re play-
ing, what the match-ups are, the game situation.
The big thing is we have the ﬂexibility to do a
bunch of different things. The pace we play
demands that a lot of people play.”

This year Willard can finally implement his style
of play, which revolves around defensive pressure
at all times to create Pitt’s offensive opportunities.
And on offense it’s the same type of fast-paced up-
and-down action. Willard wants to push the ballup
the floor, get a good shot within 24 seconds and 
use the three-pointer to space the floor.   ..

With talent as rich and deep as a three—layered
chocolate fudge cake, one might think Willard
may have some difficulties deciding which people
will play. But according to Willard, the decision is
academic; playing time revolves around practice.

Willard and the coaching staff fihn each practice
and break it down every night. They chart Cate
gories like boxing out, shots contested, ball pursuit
and offensive rebounds. If a player’s percentages
are high in practice, then they will most likely cor-
respond to game percentages.

“All things we chart are habits,” Willard said 
“How much playing time someone gets depend H   .
on the person.” . ’ Jim Madl/Staff Photographer

Right now, wiiiaid is Still Searching for 3 Start- Six-foot-10 Morgan State transfer Gerald Jordan is expected
ing lineup. McCullough and Varga appear to be t0 be Pitt's Starting Cent?“ ' ’
locks, but the rest is uncertain. ,

Gerald Jordan, a 6-11 transfer from 
Morgan St., will most likely be the start- 2
ing center. Jordan, who had to sit out last
season, tallied 15 points and 14 boards in
Pitt’s first exhibition game of the year
against the Melbourne Tigers.

‘ “I’m expecting him to get better and
better,” Willard said of Jordan. “But keep
in mind, he hasn’t played in two years.”

That’s the problem with eight of
Willard’s players: either they have no
game experience or they haven’t played
in a year or so.

But due to one of thetoughest sched-
ules in the nation, the inexperienced_will
be immediately thrust into big-time
game situations. Besides playing _a rigor-
ous Big East schedule that includes pow-
erhouses like No. 6 Georgetown, No. 3
Villanova and No. 9 Connecticut, the
Panthers also face a potent out-of-confer-
ence schedule (No. 17 North Carolina,
No. 5 Massachusetts and Georgia).

“Certainly the way the Big East is
developing, we don’t want to play five
very, very difficult games outside the
conference,” Willard said. “It’s suicide.
But for what we wanted to accomplish, I
think it was important that we did that.

“I would like to be playing an easier
schedule in the beginning of the season. I
think that would be very helpful for
this team. Certainly we have the oppor-
tunity to measure ourselves in terms of
how far we have to go by our early
schedule.”

But if things go as planned and Pitt
achieves its goals, there’s no telling how
far the Panthers can go.

“Our goal is to be playing in March,”
Varga said. ‘”That’s something we want
to achieve, and if we work hard, I think
we can get it.” — A

"Thomas added that the team’s goal is
to be among the top 25 teams in the
country.

Whether that?s attainable depends on
how well the inexperienced become
experienced.

But one thing is for sure:

“I’m expecting a lot of fun,” Willard
said. “This team is going to get better
and better as the season goes on.”

Lady Panthers lack experience, but not desire to

T/1 ree starters
return as Pih‘
/ooksfo rep/ace
Jenine Joyce and
Carol Morton

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

With all the hype surrounding Pitt men’s basket-
ball this season, it seems like Kirk Bruce and the
women’s squad have gotten lost in the shuffle.

“These girls are-out there all week doing the
same thing as the men, but they’don’t get all the
attention,” Bruce said. “We’ve got really good
players. There is no difference there.”

‘The Panthers return three starters from last
year’s team, which finished 10-8 in the Big East
and l7-ll overall. Jenine Joyce and her 12. 8
points and 6.1 rebounds per game are gone along
with three-year starter Carol Morton, who finished
her career as the all—time leader in steals and third
in assists. Morton dished out 159 assists last sea-
son to lead the Panthers.

Senior Stephanie Petho. a 5-9 guard, leads the
charge for Pitt coming into the ‘95-’96 season. She
is the leading return scorer from last year, when

she notched 12.8 points per contest. She led the
Panthers in scoring seven times last year, including
the final two games of the year against St. John’s
and eventual national champion UConn.

Despite losing team—leaders in points and assists,
Bruce feels good about having a quality player
back to build this year’s team around. 9

‘‘It’s great to have an excellent player like
Stephanie coming back to the team this year. She’s
the type of girl that comes out every day and gives
you everything she’s got,” Bruce said.

Last season Petho averaged 4.4 rebounds and
shot 80 percent from the foul line. She was named
all-tournament at both the Pitt Invitational and the
UNLV-7 Up Desert Classic.

Also returning from last year’s starting squad are
a pair of 6-2 forwards who will anchor what is sure
to be a solid front line.

Washington, D.C., native Latia Howard is back
for her sophomore campaign after making the Big

_ East All-Rookie team in ‘94. She averaged 10.7

points and a team-high eight rebounds as a fresh-
man.

Howard will be joined again on the frontline by
Pittsburgh native Melissa Thompson, who coach
Bruce feels could be the final piece to the puzzle
for the Panthers. This junior is seeing her first
action since late January when she went down with
a knee injury against Seton Hall. In 19 games last
year Thompson averaged 9.7 points and 5.7
boards.

Pitt has another 6-2 forward to throw into the
mix in sophomore Farah Woods. In her first year
out of Perry Traditional Academy in Pittsburgh,
she saw quality time as a reserve last season.

"With the loss of Carol Morton, Bruce will have

points could come from junior
college transfer LaTonya

threat from beyond the three-

game in 14.8 minutes of play. Bolfert, from
Mequon, Wis., stepped up her game last year when.
Thompson went down against Seton Hall. Bolfert
scored 12 points and had eight rebounds in 31 min-
utes and started the final 10 games of the season
for the Panthers.

Coach Bruce said, “We have great leadership on
this team. We couldn’t ask for a better group of -
seniors to set examples for the younger kids.” ‘*

Fornadel and Bolfert will vie for the wide-open
small forward spot. Others contesting for the job
will be junior Kelly Senneca and newcomers
Alecia Balich and Kortni Webb. '

Balich is a 6-1 forward from Ayala H.S. in Chino
Hills, Calif., where she is the school’s all-time
leading scorer and rebounder. Webb, out of St.
Francis Academy in Baltimore, gives Bruce anoth-
er 6-2 forward.

Rounding out the list of quality newcomers to
the Panthers is 5-9 sharpshooter Gina Montesano
from Mercy H.S. in Rochester, N.Y. In her senior
season at Mercy, Montesano averaged 23 points,
six rebounds, five assists and five steals per game
and was named Honorable Mention All-America
by USA Today.

“Gina will be a good player coming off the

. bench for us this year,” Bruce said. “She can han-

dle the ball well, shoot from the perimeter, as well
as take it to the hoop on occasion.”

With a combination of decent size and great
range, Montesano could see ample time at either
off guard or small forward.

Boston College head coach Jim
O’Brien is hoping Danya Abrams can
step up his all-Big East play and
M'ickey’Curley can get some tips
from his older brother Billy.

Otherwise it will be another long
season for the
Eagles, who just
two seasons ago
knocked off the
North Carolina
Tar Heels in the
NCAA tourna-
ment.

Abrams is a rising star in the con-
ference, and despite being double
teamed most of last year, he managed
to lead the league in scoring with a
22.1 points per game pace. -

Sophomore center Curley, whose
older brother Billy was a three-year
starter for the Eagles, will have to
step up his play in the low post. Last

season he started eight games and
scored 6.1 ppg, while‘grabbing 4.3
rebounds.

Point guard Duane Woodward, who
started as a freshman last year and

dished out 4.3 assists and scored 6.9 '

points a game, will be back as the
main ballhandler.

Versatile junior forward Keenan

Jourdon returns as well. O’Brien
used him at both forward slots and at
two-guard last season.

The Eagles bring four freshmen
onto their roster, one that has no
seniors.

Six-foot-9 forward Nate ‘Fox should
see playing time in the post, and
guard Andy Bedard, a prep school
teammate of Pitt freshman /Kellii
Taylor, will push Woodward at point
guard.

The Friars’ prayers have been
answered. Providence has landed a
very good recruiting class to upgrade
a team that was mediocre last season
despite the fact that two of its play-
ers, forward Eric Williams and center
Troy Brown, were NBA draft picks.

Michael Brown is the only senior
on the team. He was forced to play
point guard last year and averaged
8.3 points per game. He should return

to his natural shoot-
ing guard position
this season with the
arrival of Shammgod
Wells, a highly tout-
ed freshman from

 

New York City.

 

The departure of
Brownleaves a gaping hole at center
for Providence. The two remaining
centers on the roster, Piotr Szybilski
(2.4 points and 1.8 rebounds per
game last year) and Jason Evans (1.3,
0.9), will be challenged by junior
college transfer Ruben Garces for the
starting spot this year.

Junior forward Austin Croshere
(10.2, 4.9) started to make a
name for himself in last sea-
son’s Big East Tournament.
Given the opportunity to
start this season, he could
become a star. He’s going to
have to if the Friars are to
improve on last year’s sixth-
place conference finish.

Seton Hall was not a

He should have some help
in the paint this year. Seton
Hall has added two 6-10
newcomers to the roster —
junior college transfer
Bayonne Taty and freshman
Kelland Payton. That’s good
news for a team that played
without a true center last
season.

Last year’s second-
leading scorer, Danny

game), will start this season
at the point for the Pirates.
The other guard position is
up for grabs. The early

The Distractions

History will be made in South
Bend, but that’s about it. The
Fighting Irish, who have had
problems recruiting as an
independent, are seriously
hurting in the talent category,
and every other category for
that matter.

Long-time NBA coach John
MacLeod
will give
his team’s
reigns to
s e n i o r
c a p t ai n
R y a 11
Hoover.
Hoover, a 6—foot-1 shooting
guard, has been a starter for
three years, but his point aver-
age dipped just below 10
points last season.

Notre Dame’s leading retum—
ing scorer is 6-9 sophomore Pat
Ganity. As a freshman, he aver-
aged 13.4 points per game, 5.1
rebounds and boasted a 3.8
GPA. Garrity is smart, but can
he hang with the likes of
Othella Harrington down in the
post?

Besides Garrity, no other
player averaged double—figures.
That’s not promising for
MacLeod. But one thing
MacLeod can look forward to is
his prize recruit Gary Bell. Bell,

 

' a 6-5 swingman from Joliet, 111.,

averaged 22 points and 12
boards a game, earning him
third-team Parade All-America
honors. ’

Besides that, the conference
virgins should easily be taken
advantage of in the Big East.

Rutgers is hoping to revitalize

play since the 1992 NIT and

playing time at point guard.
Both recruits, according to
Cleary, will “get the opportunity
to play a lot right away.”

Leading the freshmen in the
Melbourne game was 6-foot-5-
inch forward Michael Gill, who
notched seven points in 10 min-
utes. Gill hails from Silver
Springs, Md., and averaged 17
points and nine boards per
game at Dunbar High School.
Ranked 22nd in The Basketball
Times recruiting poll, Gill has
shown an ability to score from
anywhere on the ﬂoor, includ-
ing beyond the three-point arc.

Joining Gill at the forward
position is Andre Howard. The
Panthers grabbed Howard out
of Overbrook High School in
Philadelphia, former stomping
ground of Wilt Chamberlain
and a highly competitive
recruiting area.

The seventeen-year-old
standout came to Pitt, according
to Cleary, as a result of the aca-
demic program and, more
importantly, the chance to play
for Ralph Willard and against
hometown clubs such as
Villanova and Seton Hall.

Rounding out the freshman
class this season is 6-foot-l1-
inch center Mark Blount, who

coach Cleary insists is a “legiti-
mate seven—footer.” Blount
posted monster numbers for
Dobbs Ferry High School in
New York City last year, aver-
aging 24 points, 14 rebounds.
and six blocks per game. In
addition to height, Cleary says
the freshman “brings the athlet-
ic skills of a wing player” and a
good work ethic to the squad.

Walk—on guard Amr El
Nokali rounds out this year’s
freshman class. He led nearby
Chartiers Valley High School
with 24 points per game his
senior year, taking them to the
second round of the PIAA
championships.

‘The thing that’s important to
us,” said Cleary, “is we’ve got
six great kids who want to play
and want to win here.”

Add the high ratings and the
work ethic together, and this
year’s new recruits have a
chance to do just that this sea-
son with the Panthers.

Big East Tournament. In the
game. she was 13-17 from the
foul line and added 10 rebounds.

This year, Petho will be the
on-court leader for the Lady
Panthers. Bruce said his goal-for
the team is to score in the high
70s each game, and Petho is a
integral part of that.

“She puts all of those things a
scorer has in perspective,” Bruce
said. “She can shoot from the
perimeter, take the ball to the
basket, and she's a great free
throw shooter. That’s something

. we're going to take advantage

 

of.”
Petho said she accepts the role

of team leader and began prepar-
ing for it last season. She found
herself paying attention to last
year’s senior captains, Carol
Morton and Jenine Joyce, both
on the court and off.

After being here three years,
Petho feels it’s her responsibility
to help with the freshmen play-
ers.

“They don’t know what to
expect, and I have to prepare
them and give them an idea what
to expect,”‘Petho said. “People
giving me encouragement made
a hugedifference for me when I
was younger.”

Petho realizes her inﬂuence

off the court may be more.

important than her inﬂuence on
the court. She carries a 3.7 grade
point average in the School of
Pharmacy.

When she knows a player is
struggling in a class, Petho said
she gets on her about it.

“If I were younger and one of
the upperclassmen came to me
and said, ‘You have to hit the
books a little harder; we need
you, and you can’t be ineligible,’
I know that would mean a lot to
me, and I would do everything I
could to pick it up,” Petho said.

Bruce said sees the same
thing.

“Stephanie can do anything
she wants,” he said. “Whenever

she gets a B in a class, it’s a big
deal. Whenever you’re a 3.7 stu-
dent in the School of Pharmacy,
you can’t help but rub off on
your teammates.”

It is the professional atmos-
phere of the pharmacist that
Petho looks forward to when she
graduates. She said she would
donate her time to working at
camps if asked, but it takes a
special kind of person to be a
full-time coach.

“I don’t see those attributes in
myself that "people like coach
Bruce, coach [Larry] Anderson

a and coach [Bethann] Shapiro

have,” Petho said.

Pitt as having come full circle.
It’s gone from hoping to go to
Australia to actually playing
there, and from being an over-
whelmed freshman to becoming
a team leader.

“Going through high school
and being the top dog, to coming
in here as a freshman and being

pushed down the ladder, made '

me realize that if you want
something bad enough, you’ve
got to work for it,” Petho said.

‘‘All summer for three sum-

his junior year. He needs 277
points to move into Pitt’s top
10 all-time scoring leaders.

During McCullough’s junior
.season, he was named third
team All-Big East by league
coaches. He was second on
the team with 13.3 points per
game and led the team with
seven assists and 2.8 steals per
contest.

During his heralded sopho-
more season, “Ice” emerged
as a masterful point guard. His
ballhandling and lane-driving
abilities garnered McCullough
second team All-Big East
honors. Over a seven game
stretch that season in late
December and early January,
McCullough averaged 22
points a game and led the
Panthers to an llth-place
national ranking. He led Pitt
in scoring from start to finish
that year, with a final scoring
average of 15.3. He also led
the team with 156 assists, 64
steals and 48 three-point field
goals.

McCullough, whom St.
John's phenom Felipe Lopez
lists as his basketball idol,
more importantly improved
his foul-shooting percentage
to 77.2 percent from 62.9 per-
cent his freshman year.

“lce” played in 32 games
his freshman season, during
which he teamed up with new
Panther assistant coach Sean
Miller. He finished fourth on

McCullough played high

School in the vaunted New

He led the league in scoring,
averaging 22 points per game,
while collecting five assists,
five steals and four assists per
game.

With expectations running
high this season, McCullough
feels the confidence generated
by the fans and the freshman
recruiting class. He recently
told reporters that he feels that
Pitt will not lose after January.

“Idefinitely think that we
are a tournament team,”

McCullough said.
In Pitt’s two exhibit-ion
games this season,

McCullough has disappointed
none with his play. In the
opener against the Melbourne
Tigers, “Ice” scored 11 points
and dished out seven assists
and four steals.

“Ice” was huge against
Converse AAU. He pumped

from three-point range. He

also had four blocks.

Willard said. “But people
have to understand that he has
a huge adjustment to make,
because he hasn't played this

With “Ice” expecting to

McCullough expects himself
to be all-world as well.

Bruce

°F'rom page H-8

Clarence was a professional baseball player
in the Negro leagues.

His father played for the Homestead Grays
and competed against some of the all-time
greats, like'Satchel Paige, Cool Papa Bell and
Josh Gibson.

“Sometimes, my father would be on a road
trip, and he’d stay in a hotel room with 10
different guys,” says Bruce. “[But] he was
never bitter. He never had any animosity
towards anyone.”

That’s the attitude that Bruce brings to the
Lady Panthers. He says he is a ﬁrm believer
in working hard for whatever you get —
“there are no shortcuts.” His players have
picked up on that attitude.

“He’s~a very genuine person,” says

“He’s just the kind of guy, no matter what
you ask him, personally or as a player, I think
he would do everything in his power to help
out.”

Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes says
Bruce is the complete package, as a coach
and as a person.

“Kirk is a very positive person. He’s a
great role model, very upbeat, and he delivers
that to his kids,” Jaynes says.

After his stint as a junior varsity coach at
Pitt, Bruce spent 10 years at Clariton High
School, leading the Bears to a Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League
Class II A championship in 1978. Next stop
was the Fitzgerald Field House, where he
was an assistant under Lady Panther boss

“I figured out I wanted to be a coach in my
junior year of high school,” says Bruce about
his chosen career path. _

He brings an oveiall record of 138-147 into
this campaign, but this decade his record is
80-64. As usual, Bruce brings his enthusiasm
and optimism to the ﬂoor this year.

“We’re inexperienced at the point, but our
post play is set,” he said. “Everybody’s going
to work real hard this year.”

Bruce’s voice picks up and his eyes widen

when he talks about the individual players on.

different. Econornics would be a
staple. If these players can cut
out the middle-man in contract
negotiation, they could keep that
much more for themselves.

There has to be geography
somewhere in the curriculum.
Knowing exactly where
Vancouver is will be vital to
many of these hoop gods for
years to come. I still have trouble
finding the Golden State on the
map.

Don’t forget the foreign lan-
guage requirement. With the
inﬂux of players from around the
globe in recent years, a bilingual
shooting guard will be worth a
fortune. Nobody wants Toni
Kucoc talking smack on _them
and not being able to understand
him. .

Who can forget a performance
class? Commercials are every-
where in the ‘90s, and a bad per-
formance could land a player
wearing Pumas for the rest of his
career.

We still need one more class.
How about  music. If Shaq and
Wayman Tisdale can record hit
records, why cari’t everybody
else? Imagine the salsa band
with Orlando Antigua, Edgar
Padilla of UMass and Felipe
Lopez. Music, along with
Spanish 1, could satisfy two
requirements with one class.

Wow, if they keep it up,
maybe they could even graduate
early.

giving a strong effort in prac-
tice,” Bruce boasts.

Anderson and Jaynes believe
Bruce’s enthusiasm for the game

and personality are why top

recruits keep coming to Pitt.

“When parents and players
meet him, they just get an
attachment to him,” Anderson
says. '

Recruiting is a key part of
Bruce’s job, and it’s becoming
tougher to land top players,
mostly because the competition
is getting stronger as interest in
the sport grows.

“The players are getting bet- '

ter; the competition is getting
better; and people are missing
the boat,” he said.

Bruce sits behind a neatly
organized desk in his Field
House office, and in a typical
day during the pre-season he
answers calls about scheduling
for the 1996-1997 season, one
where the Lady Panthers might
travel to Hawaii.

His office walls are a sharp
white, and in the center of the
back one hangs a caricature of
his wife and his three children.
The other walls are lined with
tiny team pictures of each year
he’s spent at Pitt.

Bruce sits back in his big
brown chair and smiles about
the prospect of the future.

“IfI stopped doing this tomor-
row, I’d be satisfied,” he says.
“But still, you’re never content.”
