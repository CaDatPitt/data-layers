lntellectuals Condemn

Athletic Probe Stall

, Aesthetics and. intellectuals in the ‘Unive1'sit_\' family en-
tered the athletic probe this week. Their, comments and schol-
arly ana.l_vses-—reeo1-dcd in a quick. poll--build. up to a. positive

conclusion.

Usually devoted exclusively to either the physical and so-

cial sciences or literature and

they were attracted by the subtle implications in the Trustees’

always scornful of. ..athletics,

They claim, the Trustees’ ac-
tion is a deﬁniterebuke to Chan-
cellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald. Here is
their reasoning:

I. The Student-Alumni Com-

imittee members were appoint-
ed by the Chancellor. The Fac-
ulty ‘ Committee members are
appointed by-the Chancellor and
approved by the Trustees. Both
bodies are, in effect,, agents of
the Chancellor. . ,

2. The committees disagreed
on James Hagan and Mike Mil-
ligan but «were in fairly close
accord on other issues. The rec-
ommendations were speciﬁc.

‘3. The} 'Cl1"anc‘ellor gave‘ both
committee reports to the Trust-
ees and certainly must have
added his own recommendation.

4. The Trustees promised def-
inite action which was taken to
mean an evaluation of the re-
ports followed by a ﬁnal rec-
ommendation. A

5. Conclusion: The Trustees
announced, “The main issues
need additional ' thought ' before
a constructive program can be
offered.“

' bo' backed their

Since the Chancellor is the man
on the scene, so to speak, and
since the Trustees delayed reach-
ing a conclusion, the Trustees are

not impressed. by either the
Chancellor’s committees or his
recommendation.

The intel1ectual—aesthetic com-
conclusion with
this logic: “We, as students, know
that an evaluation requires‘ a
minimum and a maximum
amount of time. Fourteen days of
deliberatiori is a fair maximum.”

.If their‘conclu‘sion is valid, the
limb iupoiniiwhich Athletic eDirector~‘
James Hagan and Mike Milligan
are perched should be dangerous-
ly nearthe cracking point. Or as
one wag equipped, “Instead of
‘Three Men on a Horse,” Pitt has
three men. on a limb."

Another-5 Bad Taste.
it ‘Last Friday ’s Military Ball and the crowd-
ed seventeenth ﬂoor of the William Penn have
caused much comment and stir throughout‘ the
cathedral corridors. Many ticket holders feel
that they were cheated op we dollar basis.
Thus far,’ the News has been unableto un-
cover evidence indicating oversale of tickets
for the Ball. The_ committee stayed within
Hotel and ﬁre capacity rulings by permitting
only 1400 tickets to go on sale. »
Any person attending the Ball, however,
will disagree with the statement that it was
not overcrowded. The lack of checkroom facili-
ties in the Hotel along with isolated reports of

fainting coeds ..indicate that someone‘ slipped

up in counting tickets, or estimating hotel ca-'

E pacity. Reports state that all of the cocktail

lounges and bars in the area were ﬁlled to

limit ’with Pitt dancers, too.
The second point to irritate Ball ticket hold-
I ers was the premature closing at 1 p. m. This,
it appears, was the fault of an anonymous pert

ison who-forgot to apply with the city for a

half-hour extension. The William Penn is
-unique among city hotels in that it does not
carry through this project as part of its obli-
gation. As a result, Vaughn Monroe, Bill Le-
. Roy, and the combo were instructed by city
authorities to depart on the hour. ’

It is too. bad that the combination of ﬁnan-

-‘ cial and social success cannot be applied to the

1948 Military Ball. It was a ﬁnancial success,
without doubt, But, the crowded conditions of
the ballrooms and the relsultiant rumors of il-
legal crowding along with the premature clos-
ing .leave a bad taste in the mouths of some
. three thousand persons.

 ﬂur Sophomoric Code

The issue of power to act for the various
student organizations” has been dealt with in
editorial columns of college newspapers since
the beginning of time. Many campus leaders
here have tried to push through acts giving
them at’ least trken power. Just as many have

failed in, their purpose; or, if they had any’

measure of success, theirsgains were -nulliﬁed
in a few years by the uiiique system of throw-
ing out constitutions. ‘

Such a move occurred at Pitt during ,the
war when the constitution of they present: Stu-
dent Congress went, into eifect. Student-Faculty
Associationihad, it was stated, became “cor.-,
rupt.” ‘ ‘ 9

The constitution of-Congress,,,,as it stands,
resembles that of an oppressed high school
student council.) It relies on the thinking pow-
er, the decisioning power, of persons of high
school mentality and reliability.

~Na:tional Student Association recommends
considerably more power for student groups
at Pitt, even in the "eyes of the optimistic
“goody-good.” Itis one of the "main selling
- points in _- NSA’s rapid growth infthe United
States. *

Today ’s meeting of Congress should include
the report of the constitution committee, This
group, under the direction of George Lynn,
hopes to put the long-sought teeth into Con-
gress. We wonder what the result will be.

 Sfudenis For And
Againsf Wallace

 ‘Sfassen. and MacArfh"ur

By Bill Veenis _
This election year ./may provide grand colle-
giate ﬁreworks before that fateful day in Novem-
ber. According to the Pitt News over the past few
weeks, it has -made an eventful start.
First on the parade‘of campaign-born or-
ganizations to hit campus, ‘of’ course, was the
“Students for Wallace.” The stir caused by
this group far surpassed any original estimates
I of their agitating ability. It has also placed a

thoroughly black name on the term “politi-

cal.” .

The deans’ commission, set up to consider the
possibility of political speakers .held’ hearings way
back -in January. They were expected’ to make
some kind of report long before this. Since this is
an election year, the deans’ group has decided to
sit tight. No one can blame them. Political activi-
ty on campus will get much worse before it gets
better. . ' -

This week, the first feeler went out from
the “Students for Stassen” group in Minneapo-
lis._A few students at Pitt have considered the
last week’s W announcement of MacArthur’s
candidacy started latent action—-both for and
against-—in collegiate craniums.

Considering the number of men expected to
throw their hats into the ring, Pitt will ﬁndaiitself

with more “Students for” committees than hon-

orary fraternities. At the present rate of ’ reactiv-
ating honoraries,.the situation may get out of hand.
The year should be interesting, though. It’s
the first presidential election year with the.
veterans in college. Much will be done by po-
litical groups to foist their candidates on Mr.
Ex-G. 1.

Whether the deans’ committee decides to act or I

not, politics will rear its “revolting countenance”;

and the Pitt. students will realize that he has a

greater stake in his nation than the “protector’s”
possibility of organizing a. chapter here. An

goody-good attitude implies. , ‘

Duquesne Student Claims PC_A, i ,

Editor, the Pitt News:

Like Miss Marion Adler, tonight the taste in my mouth

is somewhat ﬂat. I ‘have just
issue of the Pitt News. In Miss
students of Duquesne Universit

ﬁnished reading the March 9 ‘

Adler ’s letter to the editor the
yewere, indicted as: “a noisy,

‘rowdy, ‘group of heckl,ers”s; “slobbery mouthed ignor2amuses”;
“narrow minded adventurous students '. . .. looking for. free and

cheap ,pub1icity."’ On top of ’this,¢
Miss Adler claims that " our 1
“Americanism" . “stinks.”

We have been referred to as
“so-called enlightened and edu-
cated students of democracy, pri-
vate enterprise, and free speech.”
If you would exclude ‘so-called”
from the quotation, the remainder
would be very true.

Mrs. Goldworth, who appeared
on Duquesne’s campus and who
presided over the meeting on
Mafch 1, is a member of the Jun-

. Editor’s note: Due to space lim-
itations, we ask that all corre-
spondents please limit their let-
ters to not more than 100 words.

‘Since there are times when the ‘

number of letters received pre-
cludes the‘ printing of all of; them,

the editor reserves the 'r1°.ght,;to.

choose which ones shall be pub-

lished and ‘to edit all material in r

ior Progressive Citizens of Amer-
ica. The PCA has repeatedly hew-
ed to the communist line. ' -

Mr. S. Steven Rosner of the
United Electrical Workers is‘ rec-
ognized as a leading communist
in his own union. *

Mrs, George Wuchinich, exe-
cutive secretary of the American
Slav Congress, another ‘recogniz-
ed red front, was the other prin-
cipal speaker.

It is not difficult to conclude
that those who here back Wallace
have very deﬁnite communist in-
clinations. In addition it might be

backed by PM, The Daily Worker,
and The New Republic. .

’What is the object of the Stu-
dents for Wallace movement? On’
their pamphlets and at the rally,
the platform of the group was
based on three main issues: the
defeat of UMT, non-political aid
to .-Europe administered by the
UN, abolition of the House Com-

and the deportation {of “labor
and progressive leaders.” Each of
these points is consistent with the
party line and is directly aimed
at weakening» the U.S,.A.

In writing this letter I feel that

quesne who attended the rally to‘
express -their opposition to com-
munism under any guise. we who
attended the meeting had a very
deﬁnite purpose that can be ade-g

three. points:

To show we are not duped
by the communist line.

,To demonstrate our ‘adversity
to any and all communist
fronts. ‘

To offer warning that, al-
though we are normally quiet
and condescending, one thing
that we will not tolerate is the
open promulgation of com-
munistic propaganda in any
form.

_Miss Adler accused me of ﬂag-
waving. If defending the polit-
ical philosophy in which I be-
lieve is indicative of “American-
ism” that “stinks” then I will
graciously accept the accusation.

We all personally realize the-
inherent value of civil rights, but
there is a limit to everything. A

does not-have a right to spit at
you, especially in your own back
yard.

The _cry 1 of ‘ corruption on the

The dance was scheduled for the »
end of the month when-funds for

GPS and,-most other students were
at the lowest point.

The publicity was so restricted-i
as to limit the propagandizing of’
the dance to a small group. There '
are deﬁnitely too many do’s arid?

don’ts for publicity on any event

My pet peeve goes on display
here and now. Student Congress

stage for "opening night Thursday.

Players Score ‘First’
With ‘Sons’ Product

Critics Award Play of 19479
Opens at Foster Thursday

In about 54 hours, Pitt Players will present the ﬁrst per-
formance of “All My Sons,” a dramatic production that won
acclaim from top Broadway critics during its long run there.

Again the Players have broughtva popular Broadway show
to Pittsburgh ahead of any road show that might possibly do
so. Again Pittites and Pittsburghers as a whole have a chance
to enjoy a leading contemporary drama presented by a group

theater arts.

Heading the cast are Bill Aul
and Josephine Bosco, who between
them have acquired a sizeable
loot of stolen shows. In a play
whose excellence stems not pri-

marily from‘ the plot but depends
rather upon Arthur Miller’s su-
perbly created dialogue, Aul and
Miss Bosco are expected to deliver
their ﬁnest performances so far.

Also cast in a starring role is
newcomer Mel "Silver, whose ex-
perience with other local dramatic
groups promises‘ to make his char-
acterization of a disillusioned vet-
eran an outstanding one.

_Comments by those who have
witnessed Director Harvey Pope’s
rehearsals indicate that the entire
cast has ‘shaped up well. Angela
Giallombardo, Sam Bohinc, Robert

Tomlin, Middle East Authority,
Airs Palestine Misconceptions

By Bob Silberstein

In answer to requests that Student Congress sponsor ac speaker
to present an opposing viewpoint from that given by Kermit Roose-
velt, Rev. Earl Hollier Tomlin delivered an address last Tuesday
on “The Palestine Question and -the Jewish State.”

A leading ﬁgure in the Baptist church, Rev. Tomlin is an authority
on Middle Eastern affairs and has, from‘ 1934 to 1937, spent much
time in Jerusalem with the American School of Oriental Research.

when last in Palestine, he attend-6

ed the meetings of the United Na-
tions special committee on Pales-
tine.

Points Out Misconceptions

The main text of Rev. Tomlin
address was highlighted by his
consideration" of “Certain miscon-
ceptions generally believed by
most people.”

He said that the belief that ‘the
Jews forced Arab residents out of
Palestine has put the Jews in a
rather bad light and-corrected this
misconception with the statement
that the coming of the Jewish peo-
ple in large numbers actually
opened the doors to Arab immi-
gration and Arab prosperity.

“The Jews,” he said, “Have
made a ﬂourishing garden out of
desolate waste; have built modern
cities; established hospitals which
have saved many Arab lives; de-
veloped extensive irrigation sys-
tems and have in general built the
country up tremendously.”

Live Side by Side '

Rev. Tomlin said further that
on the whole the Jew and Arab
live peaceably together on adja-
cent farms. In every conceivable
instance" the Arab has "copied Jew-

ish methods of farming and indus-

try.
The actual conﬂict, Rev. Tomlin
commented, exists between the

"s.
._,l
.

Jew and Great Britain and the
Arab and Great Britain because of
Britain's desire to protect her oil

interests and have Palestine act as
a political buffer. He said that the
Arab upperclass landowner op-
poses partition because, “When
the lowly Arab raises his standard
of living, the controlling few can
no longer “use him or extort
him.”

The speaker opened his remarks
with background information re-
lated to the “Palestine question:
“The New Testament leads us to
believe that at the time of Christ

Population Doubles

Palestine, in its entirety, contained
roughly about 300,000 population
and that the land itself was bar-

“Players are ﬁlling a real need

Playhouse,” states Tucker. “We
haven’t got the background or fa-

we have the ﬁnancial backing of
the professional group at the Play-
house. T

“But we do have talent, ability,
and the desire to present good,‘

“We feel that too many Pittites

All graduate students wishing to study in a Central or South
American country must apply before April 1.

Qualiﬁcations for the fellowships include a U S citizenship, a
bachelors degree, completion of some graduate study, a satisfactory

knowledge of the language of the:

country to which the student’
wishes to go, and a suitable plan
of study or research topic. Stu-

in which they will study.

The following countries have
thus far indicated that they will
receive students from the United
States: Chile, Costa Rica, Haiti,
Honduras, the Dominican Repub-
lie, and Paraguay.

Sometime in May, the United
States selection committee will
prepare panels made 'up of the
new names of five students for
presentation to each currently
participating government which in
turn will choose two from the ﬁve
for one-year fellowships. T-he stu-
dents will be sent to the Latin
American couhtries starting July
1. .

Interested students should write
to the Division of International
Educational Relations, American
Republics Section, US Oﬂice of
Education, Washington 25, D. C.,
for application forms. ‘

 

Nurses Hear
Reserve Talk

Colonel Mary G. Phillips, chief
of the Army nurse corps, was

guest speaker at the nursing
workshop roundtable , discussion
on Friday, March 12. _

Mrs. Edna Groppe, director of
the nursing workshop, introduced
Col. Phillips who spoke on the
new Army Nurse Corps Reserve
whose program is similar to that
of the Army Reserve.

Under this program graduate
nurses are oriented to army meth-
ods so that in the event of another

«war military service will not be

unfamiliar to them.
Graduate nurses regularly at-
tend these workshops on the 25
ﬂoor of the Cathedral. At the
present time discussions are being
held on hospital administration.
The ex-service nurses of the
school of nursing held a ‘tea on
the same day at which Col. Phil-
lips was guest of honor. The
Katherine Mae Joyce Post No. 509,
an all nurse post of th% American
Legion, were co’-hostesses.

Eastern Rivals

In ECSA Meet

The only satisfaction Panther
swimmers got from a disappoint-
ing third—place showing in the
Eastern Collegiate Swimming As-
sociation championships at Rut-
gers Saturday was their continued
1948 superiority over Penn State
teams.

The meet made four events in
which the locals had met. the Nit-
tany Lions in athletic endeavor
since January ,1, and twice the
basketball team and two times the

/swimmers have. taken the meas-

    

ure of their State College rivals.

Rutgers, with 82 points, and
Temple, with 30, ﬁnished well
ahead of a dismal 19 points re-
corded by Ben Grady’s array. Left
in arrears were~Seton Hall, Penn
State, CCNY, Delaware, and the
U. S. Merchant Marine Academy.

The‘ free style relay team’ of
Paul Brugger, Don’ Wilde, Captain
Walt Jackson and Dick Petro ﬁn-
ished second as expected in the
400 free style relay. The medley
combine of, Bob McHale, Bill
Manko, and Petro took third.

The saddest showing was in-
dividual‘ events. Petro ﬁnished
ﬁfth in the 100 free style. Don
Wilde’s third in the 50, Bill Man-
ko’s backstroke fourth, and Mike
Levine’s ﬁfth in the 220-yard free
style completed the Pitt scoring.

When the above ﬁgures were printed some years ago,
there wasn’t much the average man could do to change

this gloomy picture. .
He tried his level best

to set money aside. And some-

times he succeeded. But more often he failed. He put
it oﬁ‘. He made excuses. He made New Year's resolu-
tions to save—and_quiet1y'broke them.

You can see above how he ended up.

Winning Pitt’s _individual scoring championship during the just-
completed "basketball campaign doesn’t impress Dodo Canterna par-

ticularly.

“I’d~rather we’d won more games thanlbeen the top scorer,” he

-. mused.

Canterna, an expert with his
the 21-game

This total barely surpassed that

 of his teammate, Sammy David,
» who tallied 241. Dodo’s 14 mark-
" ers at West Virginia Saturday

night did the trick. David, who

. had been six points up on the

Freeport dead-eye, was checked
at ﬁve by the Mountaineers. '
Fields One Game High
.Dodo was especially deadly
against the high-scoring Moun-

'3-taineers, who just missed landing

in the select tournament circle. In
thehthriller here a month ago he
registered the one-game high with
22.points.

He explained this by saying,
“West Virginia used a man-for-
man against us both times. Our
plays work well against this type
of defense. _ ,

“Now, Westminster played a
man-for-man against Sammy and
I and a sort of zone against the
rest. With that and Chet Dem-

. ‘binski in the middle, we couldn’t

use our pick-offs through the cen-
ter.” Canterna scored only 20
points against the Titans.
. . Win Ten Games

Last year he tallied just 151
markers and ﬁnished behind Da-
vid in the scoring handicap. The

i four contests he missed because

of a shoulder injury kept this
count down.

There is general agreement that
the Panthers churned out a suc-
cessful season, Carlson’s twenty-
seventh. The Pitts opened up with
two road trips, seemingly detours
through Hades, for they dropped
their first six games.

Then they about-faced and sur-
prised quite a few peope by win-
ning 10 of the remaining 15 con-

Avenging an earlier one—point
defeat at the Tartan range, the
Pitt varsity riﬂe -team trounced
Carnegie Tech, 1359 to 1279, in a

shoulder-to-shoulder match ﬁred
Thursday afternoon at the Pitt
Stadium range.

High scorer for the afternoon
was Pitt’s Ray Hixson, with “a
total of 281.

Other members of the shoulder-

to-shoulder team include: Philip
Myers, Paul Robinson, Alvin Wal-

lace, Richard Pfeiffer, Donald

Furman, Murray Love, Sherwin
Mandelblatt, LaVerne Hodil, and
Robert Davis.

Partial returns from the postal
matches ﬁred by the varsity team
between January 10 and March
6, show the Pitt riﬂemen far out
in front with 27 wins against 11
defeats.

Among the schools defeated by
the Panther varsity were Purdue,
Penn State, M.I.T., Cornell, Mis-
souri, Iowa and. Harvard. Pitt
Marksmen dropped matches to
Indiana, Arizona, Illinois and
Michigan State.

Final results from schools which

Eight catchers Vie i..R.g..i.a..
Job Wth Mitterling's Varsity

Kopelman -

Baseball coach Ralph Mitterling is in one of those pleasant pre-

dicaments that baseball coaches enjoy. He is faced with the dilemma

of selecting his starting catcher from a bumper crop of eight prom-

ising receivers.

Turning over in Mitterling’s mind is the idea that veteran re-
ceivers, George Matich and George Schweinbatten, may not have

an easy time holding their uniform

S.

’Four newcomer, Al Satriano,¢
Mark Maystrovich, Charlie Varo,
and Virgil Fazzio, have been very
impressive, despite the fact that
the workouts have not included
throwing on steals.

Fazzio had a t_ry-out last year
but did not stick with the squad.
“He looks much better this year,”
said Mitterling. Maystrovich is
known for his quarterbacking on
the football squad.

Ed Coffey, another catcher who
was a second-stringer before he
went into the service, is out for the
team, and has looked fair. “But
he’s still too light,” Mitterling
complains.

Coffey contracted dengue fever,
a disease similar to malaria, while
in the service and has not been in
top shape since.

Bill McCutcheon is the eighth

catcher who is out for the team.
But McCutcheon, like Coffey, is
lacking in weight and could use
additional experience.

 jg Female ~'Barflyl Laws Ousted:
Educulional Plan Proposed

BOSTON, MASS.-—Our culture is too tolerant of drunkards oi’
both sexes, according to Dr. Herbert D. Lamson. proI’essor of sociolo-

gy at Boston College.
Commenting on the proposed

sale of alcoholic beverages-to women “barflies," Dr. Larnson stated.
that “the alcoholic problem should be controlled for both sexes. A
law which differentiates cannot be far-reaching
the basic problem." 9’

. “We must ‘de—smartize’ the
drinlt," he "continued. “We have
been sold a bill of goods that
its smart to consume liquor by
persons who have proﬁts at stake.
And profits in the industry are
great,” he added. .

“All youth gets today," asserted
Dr. Lainson, “is the Wet adver-
tisine‘. We must have unbiased
research on a social basis and
present the facts to them. People
shield each other and there is a
conspiracy of silence which tends
to underestimate deaths from al-
coholism.”

As an alternative program to
statute laws, Prof. Lamson sug-
gested preventive methods. Alco-
holics Anonymous, according to
him, is now in the first stages of
the curative method, but a pre-
ventive approach must be begun
in schools with health and alco-
holic education. This must be be-
gun in the grade schools, and var-
ied at different school l.eve_ls, he
explained.

It takes a good many years to
make a chronic alcoholic, accord-
ing‘ to the sociologist, and if new,
wholesome releases for modern
living tensions are found, this

Oil Substitute
To Eradicate
War Cause

BOSTON, MASS.-If synthetic
alcohol replaces fuel oil, one of
the chief causes of modern Wars
will be eradicated, according‘ to
Dr. C. W. Wolfe, professor of.
geologvat Boston College.

“S_v.nthetic alcohol made from
wood shavings and corn. istalks will
probably take the ‘place of fuel
oil,” stated. the professor.

“Such a switch will be a bless-
ing in disguise.” he continued.
“The sooner we get away from.
the use of oil the better, because
most world conflict now centers
on the control of oil.”

Looking toward the-afuture, the
proftessor declared “I think there
wil. be a lot of drilling in our
coastal waters in coming years.
This drilling will take place at a
good distance from shore and
should be successful, for there is
undoubtedly quite a bit of oil
there. Nevertheless, the, need for
a substitute product remains, and
we must find it.”
