Students Urged

To Observe  
Traffic Rules

‘City traﬂic authorities have re-
quested that Pitt students heed
the traffic regulations now in ef-
fect in the vicinity of the Cathe-
dral of Learning.  L .-

- A state ordinancerequires that
the curb space. in front of the en-

trances tg public buildings be kept
clear. Applied to ‘Pitt, the ordi-

 nancesmeans that no parking is

permitted at the curb "spaces at the
end of the walks leading to Ca-
thedral of Learning entrances.
Few Pitt students seem to be
aware that there is -a two-hour-
parking-limit in effect’ on the
Pittsburgh Athletic association
side of Fifth avenue and on Lyt-
ton avenue. The PAA employs a
man whose sole duty is to enforce
this regulation. Some time ago,
for the convenience of Pitt stu-
dents, city traffic authorities re-
moved the parking time limit from
the Cathedral of Learning side of
Fifth avenue between _ Bigelow
boulevard -and Belleﬁeld street.
Officers from the traffic‘ divi-
sion of the Pittsburgh Police de-
partment have explained one
point which has -confused Pitt stu-
dents for some time. Although
there is a yellow line on the Ca-
thedral of Learning side of Big-
elow boulevard, it is permissible
to park «there (except in front of
the two,’ entrances). The yellow
line was put there in 1943 to re-
serve Bigelow boulevard as a
drill ﬁeld for the soldiers ’st,_a-'
tioned‘ at Pitt. The -city has not
yet removed the line, but «stu-
dents may use the space for park-
ing their cars. "

There will be a meeting in

the Stephen Foster social room

' tomorrow at 11:30 a. m. for all

veterans, men and women. The

formation of: the Veterans as-

-sociation of the University of
Pittsburgh will be d-iscussed.

Pharmacy Adds
February Class

The School of Pharmacy has an-
nouncedthat as a convenience and

aid to returned veterans it will"

enroll a freshman class in‘ Febru-
ary, 1946. 4

‘This action was decided upon in

. are-cent meeting at Harrisburg of

the State Board of Pharmacy and
the deans of the colleges of phar-
macy of the University of Pitts-
burgh, Duquesne university, Tem-

ple university, and the Philadel-:
phia College of Pharmacy and Sci-

91.1C€.- . ,. 

“Norm-al procedure.” said’ Dr. E.
C. Reif, dean of Pitt’s School of
Pharmacy, “is for one class a year
to be enrolled in September, but
the release of many potential stu-
dents from the services within the
past few months has created an
unusiial situation, and we feel that
:—a February class will ‘help _solve
the ‘veterans’ problem.”

"The February ‘class, for which
non-veterans will also be accept-

‘ed, will continue in school through

the summer months, giving the
students an opportunity to become
sophomores in Septemberwith the
previously enrolled September
class. ..

“The veterans,” said Dr. _Reif,
“will thus save nearly a year
which would otherwise have been
spent marking time until another
September class could be en-

‘ rolled.”

Heinz Chapel Organist Conducted
First Band Concert After  Day

Another veteran home frome

overseas is Russell G. Wichmann,
organist -of the Heinz Chapel and
instructor in music appreciation.
He spent three and one—half years
with the Fourth Infantry division
in France and Germany.

Mr. Wichmann was a »Warrant *
Ofﬁcer and band leader’ with the —

division which sailed for Eng-
land in January, 1943. After in-
vasion training in‘ England, the
division hit Utah beach, Normandy,
at H hour on D day, but Wich-

mann didn’t come ashore until 14 ‘
days later with a ,,rear echelon.

The division fought all the way
up the peninsula of Cherbourg,
and was the ﬁrst outﬁt to reach
the city of Cherbourg. The band
played the first American music to
be heard there, while the Ger-
mans -still held the harbor and the
surrounding ‘territory.

The division spearheaded the
breakthrough of Saint Lo, and ‘the
band. acted as security guard at
the Division‘ headquarters. The
men pushed ahead toward the city
of Paris and were the first Amer-
icans to enter the famous metro-
polis. After fighting their way
through Belgium, _the Fourth
reached the powerful Seigfreid

Line and.‘ -again were the first to‘

crack its fortiﬁcations. ,
Crossing the Rhine at Worms,
the division battled the’ Germans
at Wurtemburg, Augsburg, Nur-.
emburg, and Munich. During all
these campaigns, the band found
time to give an occasional concert.
When VES day was declared, the
Fourth had reached ,the border
of Aus,tri.a."f "  ' " 
In December,‘ 1944, General
George  Patton credited the sav-

R. G. VVichmann

ing of“ the city of Luxembourg,
Belgium, from invasion to the
courage and ability of the Fourth
division. In addition to the credit
given by Patton, Mr. Wichmann
has ﬁve battle, stars and the

Bronze ‘Star. However, he speaks

with pride only of the division,
tandsays‘ little about himself dur-
ing the flong and dangerous serv-
ice.

Om 71...... 14a  

Strikes are the only form of warfare still condoned by so-
ciety. Though there maybe objection in some quarters to our
use of the term warfare, the term is, in reality, quite apropos.
With the World currently at peace, America, ironically enough,
isbeing torn by a vicious internal warfa,re——a warfare that is
depriving our people of needed material goods and preventing
our economy from assuming, once again, an even peace-time
keel.

Above the hodgepodge of claims and counter-claims, one
salient and undeniable fact stands o.ut. It is that strikes are
not proﬁtable either to labor or management. Instead of creat-
ing, they destroy; instead of gain, there is loss; and ﬁnally, it
must be kept in mind that very few strikes have ever fully ac-
complished their objectives. Also, every production hour lost
through strikes is gone forever and can never be regained. Thus,
time, in its relentless and uncompromising ﬂight, cheats us
through our own waywardness.

American labor is the most well-fed, the highest paid, and
the most all—around pampered labor in the world. It is our
superior systems of production and our technological genius
that have brought this about. Labor has the right to organize
and it has organized; it has a voice in the government and is
striving to become more civic minded. Therefore, we have no
quarrel with the American workingman. -However, as anyone
newly arrived in a. position of power is apt to do, labor is feeling
its oats too strongly and is stepping out of bounds.

We have seen American labor raised to this pinnacle of
power within a relatively short while. However, now that the
pinnacle has been scaled, certain labor leaders are becoming
power drunk. They seek to use the power of their unions as a
springboard to personal political success. They call for higher
wages at a time when we are struggling to dam up the tide of
inﬂation, and they deliberately hold up the vital reconversion
process with ﬂagrant czar-like statements and actions. Labor
must realize that the American business man is the cornerstone
upon which our -free enterprise economy is founded, and that
this business man, within prescribed limits, is entitled to run his
business as he sees ﬁt. This is in accordance with the most
fundamental principles of political democracy. The power of
management must not be encroached upon by labor or. govern-
ment, for it is——in the ﬁnal count—-—the business men, both large
and small, who really make our capitalistic system tick.

_ It is to be hoped that, in this new year, the American work-
ing-man will see just how his leaders are harming both him and
his reputation by their economically unsound methods. It is to
be hoped that he will put his faith once again in the future of
America, instead of being mislead by the fallacious mouthings
of politically ambitious rabble-rousers who receive, through his
sweat and ttoil, comfortable incomes for leading him into ill-
repute and beguiling him with a pseudo economics.

Millions of ex-GI’s are looking to America’s vast instru-
ments of production to give them the sort of future they have
long dreamed of. This futurewill become a reality only when
harmony is restored, once again, on the industrial front. We
cannot fully support world cooperation, while we lack this very
cooperation at home. We must remember that unity, like mis-
sionary Work, begins at home.

Pageant Marks
Carver Week

“Out of Nothing”, a pageant
by Miss Verna M. Curry, night
student in radio script writing at
Pitt, had its world premier in
Foster memorial hall, January 4.
Portraying the life. of George
Washington Carver, the pageant
was part of the Pittsburgh’ ob-
servance of Carver Week which
began January 1.

Miss Curry, said her choice of
the title for the pageant was
based on the idea that George
Washington Carver was always
making something out of nothing
all through his life. Built around
a narrator and a series of tab.-
leaux, the pageant included 3.0

minutes of dialogue along with .

musical settings. It was enacted
by a cast of 15 with the accom-
paniment of 75 Voices fr_0.m lead-
ing Pittsburgh choirs. It has been
sent to 25 other universities to be
used during a nationwide tribute
to Carver.

One scene in “Out of Nothing”
was written by Miss Marion K.
Koelsch, another student in the
same script class.

Telephones

 

    

nd Afoai i

T116 Bell. System plans an extensive trial of two-way radio
iniproviding telephone service to vehicles in a number

of large cities.

Connections with other telephones will be made
through the nearest of several receiving and transmitting
stations operated by the telephone company. It is gener-
ally similar to the existing ship-shore radio telephone
service for vessels in coastal and inland waters.

The main job right now is making more telephones
available for those who have been waiting for regula-
service. But as soon as the new equipment can be built
the Bell System will begin extending telephone service

to vehicles.

It’s back to work after a two week vacation.

Larry Mendy

Reporting.

 

Sports Editor
I had hoped this

column would be able to announce that the faculty athletic commit-
tee had given the athletic department the green light to give the

gridders a banquet.

The committee decided NO. Why?
divulged. It is being kept a secret.

It Wasn’t

Some excuses which have been heard are (1) It’s too late and

not timely to give the gridders a banquet now.

(2) The athletic

ﬁnancial condition is very poor. ¢

It would be too bad if the foot-
ball team had that too late at-
titude. In many of the games this
year the opposition jumped off to
big leads. If the boys feel that
it’s too late to win now, let’s just
start loafing; I wonder what kind
of reputation ‘Pitt would have got-
ten? Now the ﬁnanciai problem.
Pitt has a big time schedule and
the teams appearing on it must
be guaranteed so much before
they jaunt to the “Smokey
City,” whose fault it is that -the
gate receipts aren’t there. The
gridders aren’t the ones consult-
ed before the schedule is made.
Then our head coach -Mr. Shangh-
nessy is big time. He’s getting a
salary for which any college coach
would settle. It's just too bad that
the boys who play the game have
to suffer because others are mak-
ing the errors.

We Canboit

Since the student body can’t
rely on the proper authorities to
give the gridders a banquet, then
the students should do something
about it. The football team is the
students’ team. Therefore, this
column suggests that Student Con-
gress take it upon it's shoulder to
see that beginning next year the
football team be given a banquet
shortly after the ﬁnal g-ame. The
date should be published in the
Compass, and the Vade Mecum and
be made an annual affair with a
chairman chosen to make com-
plete arrangements. Tickets can be

sold. and the football team invited «

as guests. Now is the time to act
-—let’s not pop up with the ex-
cuse, “It’s too late when next
year comes around!”

Believe It or Not

Several days before the North-
South football game took place in
Birmingham, eight players were
called off to the side by a North
coach. The coach blurted forth, “I
can see where you fellows have
been schooled in fundamentals.”
Guess who three of those fellows
were—none other than John Kosh,

Nittany Here
Saturday Night

By George Kiscda

When Pitt and Carnegie Tech
draw beads in their annual grudge
battle at Pitt Stadium tonight,
ﬂoor fans may see an old story
with a new twist.

For the 58th installment of the
city’s sole remaining basketball
rivalry ﬁgures to be another Pitt
victory, No. 46 in the all-time
series.

However, the script will have a
new addition in George (Red) Sil-
ve-rman, who has replaced his old
boss, Max Hannum, as Tech’s
coach. Silvermuan took over the
reins last Saturday as the Plaid
plastered Case, 50-35, for its sec-

North-South game and were in
there when 20 of the 26 North

‘points were scored. Kosh was the

North’s acting captain for about
27 minutes and was responsible
for stopping a Southern scoring
threat when he tackled the ball
carrier on the 10 yard line and
made him fumble. Kosh then re-
covered. The score — North 26,
South 0.

A
0nd success in seven starts.

Despite the change in head m-en,
the Hannum touch will not be
missing tonight. Maxie gifted Sil-
verman with a valuable piece of
insurance in his own son, Gene
Hannum, who has been Tech’s
mainstay -this year. In seven skir-
mishes, Gene, a forward, has strip-
ped the strings for 107 points,
second highest total in the state.

The virtually all-frosh Skibos
pack another worthy basket weav-
er in 6-4 Paul Kuzma, giant cen-
ter from Monessen who has mov-
ed at a 10--point clip. With Han-
num at forward will be Lou
Heiles, while Joe Harmuth and

TPitt-Tech At Stadium Tonight

Panthers Stop
Geneva, 54:-43

Sammy David, the Bridgeville
bomber, should see plenty of ac-
tion following his 19-point bar-
rage against Geneva last Satur-
day. David sank seven ﬁelders
and ﬁve charity chances as the
Panthers removed Geneva from
the unbeaten class, 54-43, for their
second win.

Ritt grabbed the lead a-t the out-
set, fell behind, 23-22, at halftime,
then came on with a third—quarter
ru-sh that brought a 38-35 edge.
With Dave Podbielski and Elmer
Lipp hitting on one-hand push
shots, the Covies tied the count
at 41-41 but fell apart in the last
ﬁve minutes when Pitt went on a
scoring rampage.

Carl-son's cagers will follow up
the Tech tiff by entertaining Penn
State Saturday. Averaging 6-3,
Johnny La-wler’s lanky Lions-—
four of whom were regulars last
year-—-have split even in six
games «and are overdue to hit
their stride. The Lions’ chief
nemesis is Herb Currie, who goes
6-8.
