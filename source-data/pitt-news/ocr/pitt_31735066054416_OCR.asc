Golden Key honors new

Pitt’s Golden Key Honor
Society chapter honored students
who demonstrate academic excel-
lence Sunday night at its annual
induction ceremony.

At 7:00 p.m., inductees and
their families filed into Bellefield
Auditorium for an inspirational
evening of scholastic recognition.

President Susan Selai and the
society’s adviser, professor Richard
Tobias, welcomed new members
into the organization that honors the
top 15. percent of juniors -and
seniors in universities across the
country and the world. Pitt’s Golden
Key chapter inducted over 430 new
juniors and seniors this academic
year, approximately 140 of which
attended Sunday’s ceremony.

Tobias emphasized in his speech
that Golden Key is entirely student-
run and that members strive to meet
the society’s universal goal of
“Scholastic Achievement. and

 

Excellence.”

“We think that one of the things
we should say in the Golden Key is
that scholarship is as important as
football or basketball,” he said.

Golden Key illustrates academic
importance by awarding scholar-
ships to two outstanding students —
a junior. and a senior—each year.
Junior Kevin McBride, an Industrial
Engineering major with a 4.0 QPA,
received the first $500 scholarship.

The second went to senior Christa’

Cardillo, an English .Writing and
Anthropology major with a 3.94
Q.P.A. _
“[Maintaining a 4.0] is lot of work,
but I enjoy it because it’s a chal-
lenge,” said McBride. “That’s part
of me: trying to challengemyself to
do more.” I

The society also inducted a
number-of honorary members from
Pitt’s faculty. Honorary inductee
professor Beverly Harris-Schenz, a
German professor and vice provost

They lurk in the shadows of the street,
waiting for someone to pass by. They
shake their cups and ask for just spare
change, a little help for the homeless.

The question is how to decide who
really needs the money.

Panhandlers may make a student feel
awkward or intimidated. Often people
cross the street just to avoid them.

They claim to be homeless, and some
people feel sorry for them, as they would
for anybody down on his luck, and drop in
a handful of change. .

For other people, the familiar defenses
come up: “They have homes to go to.
They’re healthy men in their rr1id—thirties,
who just don’t ‘feel’ like working. We have
to work for our money, so why shouldn’t
they?”

While many of the panhandlers are in
need of help, it’s impossible to tell the dif-
ference between them and the ones just out

to con you out of your money.

One way of making sure your money
goes to the needy is to donate to those orga— 0
nizations dedicated to providing food and
shelter to the downtrodden.

“Instead of giving your money away
to panhandlers, put it in the canisters that
most of the businesses in Oakland keep
that go to the Jubilee Kitchen,” said Pitt
Police Chief ’ Rick Boyd. The Jubilee
Kitchen is a shelter in Pittsburgh that pro-
vides food and clothing for the city’s
homeless. _

Otherwise, Boyd said students should
avoid ‘ giving money to people on the
streets.

“They are con artists, thieves, and oth-
erwise persons with severe substance
abuse problems, mainly crack cocaine,”
said Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd. “Their '
main reason of being here is to suck money
from the students for drugs and booze.”

Tipper Gore helps raise $2
million for AIDS research

Across the World

ROME — Pope John Paul H entered the
hospital Sunday night to have his appendix
removed. Doctors say that the procedure
was necessary because the pontiff’s appen-
dix was inﬂamed.

A myriad of people gathered around at
the entrance of the Gemelli Polyclinic as the
76-year-old pope exited his bulletproof
Mercedes. Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Rome Mayor Francesco
Rutelli were among the famous on hand at
the arrival.

The Pope had a full day earlier Sunday ’

— appearing in good health as he attended
ceremonies and greeted audiences at public
appearances‘. As the pope entered the hospi-
tal, he addressed the crowd by saying that he
was being hospitalized to have a minor

2 operation and asked for the prayers of his

followers. The New York Times

KABUL, Afghanistan —— The Taliban, a
group of Islamic militantsthat have taken
over most of Afghanistan, waged an all-out
attack on ousted government soldiers hiding
in a northern valley on Sunday. This second

» day of attacks -had the Taliban using rockets

instead of the guns they usually use.

As the ﬁghting raged on, the militants
moved tanks, trucks and ﬁghters to the area.
The Taliban claim to have taken control of
three peaks around the valley. However,
they have yet to completely defeat the gov-

ernment troops. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

WASHINGTON —— Tipper Gore led a
group of about 15,000 people as they
marched their way around the nation’s capi-
tol on Sunday to raise money for AIDS —
the disease that has killed more than
300,000 people in the United States. The
money raised will go to help support people
who have the disease as research is still
being done. .
During the 6.2—mile walk, volunteers

Director of chapter development Stephen

student dedication.

“The group here has very strong, motivated

students as well as faculty.”

Tobias said that inducting honorary members
like Provost James Maher and having prominent
faculty and administrators present at Golden Key

scholarship assistance, while the others who
have not met this benchmark are reviewed
again by admissions representatives.

Some of the many scholarships avail-
able for incoming freshmen are speciﬁcally
designated for engineering, business, or
minority students. But three academic
scholarships in particular are open to all
incoming students. These are the University
Scholarships, the Honors College
Scholarships, and the

According to Joe Wright, an admis-
sions representative for Pitt, the University
Scholarships are assigned to students based
on class rank, grades, their scores on SAT or

Awarded money from that scholarship
can range from $1,000 to $6,000 and is gen-
erally higher for out-of-state students in an
effort to compensate for the increased
tuition cost.

The University Scholarship is available
for up to four years provided the student
maintains a grade point average of 3.0 or
better. The student must also take 24 or
more credits a year.

The University Scholarship is the most
common type of academic scholarship
given out with more than 300 awards dis-
persed armually. '

According to Kevin Altomari of the

the admissions office, they are sent directly
to the honors college, where a committee
led by honors college Dean Alec Stewart
decides which students to interview.

The winners are selected and offered
the Chancellor’s Scholarship which consists
of full tuition, room and board and is avail-
able for up to four years under the same stip-

ulations as the University Scholarship.

Some nominees who do not receive the
Chancellor’s scholarship but who are
deemed excellent students and dedicated
individuals are given what is known as an
Honors College Scholarship.

Wesley Posvar, former president of Pitt,
was the man who created the Chancellor’s
Scholarship to increase the academic stand-
ing of the University.

“I was struck by the fact that we were '

giving out a couple hundred athletic schol-
arships based on merit and athletic s ' ,”
Posvar said. “I thought there was a strong

case for academic scholarships based on J

merit and high school performance; It has
proven to be a great success because it
brings in outstanding students, which makes
this University a target for some of the best
and brightest students.” .

One of those students, Damion Shelton,
a freshman Chancellor’s awardee, came to
Pitt for the engineering program but said the
ﬁlll Chancellor’s scholarship gave him an
added incentive to attend.

“It’s not just about being intelligent. It’s
about being willing to put forth a large
amount of work,” Shelton said.

Michael Mulheam, another
Chancellor’s recipient, said the dedication

of a university to its students is reﬂected in;

around Oakland, they have a combined 400
totalling 753 charges, according to Boyd.
Those charges range ﬁom arson to aggra-
vated assault to armed robbery. Drug
charges are practically a prerequisite for the
panhandlers.

Last year a city ordinance called the
Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance was
passed in Pittsburgh. It states that panhan-
dling is legal if the actor is passive.
However, if the panhandler tries to block
someone’s path, follow someone, use
obscenities, or otherwise intimidate in any
way, his actions are illegal.

The ordinance also prohibits panhan-
dlers from standing within 10 feet of an
automatic teller machine. The campus
police urge anyone who witnesses a viola-
tion of any of these guidelines to report it
immediately. _ '

Oakland’s bad image has been attrib-
uted in part to the fact that panhandlers are
present, Boyd said. '

“It gives others the impression that
Oakland is not a nice neighborhood. [Pitt]
has a vested interest and we are doing every-
thing in our power to discourage panhan-
dlers in Oaklan ” he said. “We want them
out.”

mom PAGE 1%

 

In the past two years the number of
panhandlers in Oakland has decreased from
about 50 to about 10 to 15, but Boyd said he
believes that panhandlers attract other pan-
handlers and that as long as there is one left,
there is the potential for more to appear.

He listed some of the deceptive
schemes to try and collect money. One
woman is notorious for acting as if her car
broke down and she needs money for the
bus.

Another trick that’s often used is the
presence of a young child accompanied
with the complaint that the panhandler
needs money because the child is hungry.

The most common is the doorman
technique, where a panhandler stands in

‘ front of a store or bar (usually the Attic or 7-

11) and holds the door open for customers,
expecting change in return.

Boyd said students who come from
non-urban communities are not used to this
and normally fall for the schemes, shelling
out some change or even a couple dollars.

Here’s another update on the idiocy of the PittCard: students
must now pick up a Student Activities Card to go along with it.

The reason that we need this second card to take up space in our
wallets is because the new and improved IDs will not work if stickers
are placed on them. Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to tell the
difference between students, faculty, and staff by looking at the new
ID. For the purposes of identifying those who are eligible to vote in
student elections and to gain student admission to University events,
we must carry the Student Activities Card too.

The new IDs were supposed to be more eﬂicient; however, we
now need to cany more than one card due to the advent of the
PittCard. Surprisingly enough, the PittCard isn’t making our lives any
simpler, just more cluttered.

 
   

Give to a worthwhile cause

Panhandlers: are they really in need of our help or just freeloaders
looking for a handout? This is a dilemma each student at this University
must grapple with. A

But don’t give money to any of them. If you can’t tell which ones
honestly deserve the money, then don’t waste your hard-earned money
on just anyone. -

If in your heart you feel that you should help those who truly need
the money, there are plenty of organizations out there to help those in
need. We suggest donating your spare change to such organizations as
the Salvation Army, Jubilee Kitchen, and other grassroots efforts right
here in the city of Pittsburgh. . ‘

It isn’t right that the desire to help a fellow human being must be
tempered with the knowledge that you may or may not be getting ripped
off by some small-tirne con artist. However, in today’s society, and espe-
cially in Oakland, that is the case. So, you must protect your own inter-

We need to analyze the myths of gov'l

 

Exploring our version of capi-
talism reveals that its basis is signiﬁ-
cantly less than noble. It sustains
itself because it is a social version of
natural selection and it feeds on per-
sonal vice, which in combination are

self—perpetuating. This social

, Darwinism works great for the pow-
‘ erful and rich (who not by coinci-

dence are one in the same), but is
horrendous and irreconcilable for the
less fortunate. In our inﬁnite wis-
dom, we have allowed those in
power to tailor this “Darwinism” into
a perverse state that necessitates
poverty. We have allowed our gov-
emment to perpetuate myths that
people in poverty are there of their
own volition or due to their own lazi-
ness by giving mere lip service to the
“Land of Equal Opportunity” con-
cept. It is not that capitalism in the
sense of free enterprise is inherently
bad, it’s just that we have allowed it
to evolve into a state of things where
our society’s ingrained iniquities are
nearly irreparable.

The plight of poverty in this
country is a perfect’ example of
where our warped version of capital-
ism has gone ‘to the birds. To rise out
of poverty, one needs a job with good
pay, and to get a job with good pay,
one needs a decent education. To get
a decent education, one needs
money. To get money, one needs to

have a job with good pay. The circle ’

goes on and where it stops, no one
knows, or seems to care. Our gov-
emrnent commits the travesty of pla-
cating our compassionate concems
for the impoverished by using social
programs such as welfare. Welfare
barely provides enough money to

subsist, let alone anything resem-
bling a good education. By giving
this token money, we are not helping
the poor step out of poverty. We are
merely directing them further into
the vicious circle while letting the
rest of the population believe that we
are actually helping out Welfare
reformhas been a start out of this
downward spiral, but nothing near
enough has been done towards reso-
lution. _

Part of the reason for this is the
“I deserve it” myth plaguing the
upper three-fourths of the monetary
class system. Many affluent and
rniddle—class Americans in college or
middle age feel they have worked
hard for their money and deserve to
keep it. I have some shocking news
for these deluded masses. They were

- born into a certain amount of money.

But where did it all start? John Doe is
born into a rniddle—c1ass family.
John’s parents did everything they
could to give John a childhood
where money was not a considera-
tion. He lived in an semi-afﬂuent
area where the public school system
was excellent due to the support of
percentage—based taxes that bring in
enough revenue to create a healthy
school environment. The money
brings in excellent teachers, excellent
lab equipment, computers, and
everything that fosters a good learn-
ing enviromnent. John works hard
enough to get his straight As. He
goes to college on a scholarship or
his parents’ credit card, and some-
how by the time he’s done, he has
this strange notion that he spent his
entire life working hard for the
money he’s earning. His mistake is
that he forgets to realize that from the
root, everything he has achieved is
based on an opportunity given to him

vt--:-/

by his parents, the community, his
teachers, and his inherited prosperity.
These people (sony about the broad
generalization) need to get off their
high horses and realize that it is our
responsibility to give the same

»opportunity that was given to us,

back to those who, by our design ,
don’t have it.

Our prosperity is taking the
lifeblood of other human beings.
Poor people are not lazy or stupid.
Many poor‘ people work 70 hours a
week at a minimum wage job, just to
survive. If those college students
who were born into their education
worked half as hard, we might have
a few_Nobel prizes on our hands.

As Americans who believe in
our system of government, we have
a responsibility to dispel these myths
and try to the best of our ability to
institute change in our social pro-
grams. A change from handout-
based programs to education—based
programs would be a start. I am not
proposing a socialistic government,
just a kinder, gentler capitalism. The
problem is that the government has
gotten itself into such a quandary of
bureaucracy that governmental
change is nearly impossible.
Education of ourselves and our fam-
ilies combined with actions is the
only way around these debilitating
myths. We also need to stop whining
about raised taxes to fund education
or to create job training programs.
N 0 one in the entire world whines as
much about taxes and giving back to
the community as much as
Americans do. It’s that false “I
deserve it” syndrome that causes it.
Wake up America
Jay DeMartino thinks we need to lis-
ten more critically to the bedtime sto-
ries the government keeps telling us.

America's
Team no more

    

How ‘bout them Cowboys?

Everyone knows that armoying little
jingle, said by ex—Dallas coach Jimmy
Johnson in the locker room after the boys
won the ﬁrst of their three Super Bowls in
the past four years. It was seen and heard
over and over, as Cowboy fever dominated
the football world for the majority of the
‘90s.

This year is different, and I’m over-
joyed to armounce the reign is over, and
America’s Team (which they so much love
to call themselves) is on the verge of self-

- destruction. Now, they did beat the Eagles

last Monday night to get to 2-3. However,
the Eagles lost starting quarterback Rodney
Peete and had to go with the inexperienced
Ty Detrner, who has never started an NFL
game. Despite losing their quarterback and
any consistency on offense, a stingy Eagles
defense stopped Dallas again and again, giv-
ing the Birds a chance to win. This is unchar-
acteristic of past_Cowboy teams that would

. bury a team once they were ahead.

This is not the same dominating team as
the Boys of even a year ago,,when they
destroyed basically the same Eagle team in
the playoffs 31-10. The Dallas defense is a

far cry from recent years when it was num— -

ber one in the league. Free agency has aided
in the decline of the Dallas defense, with the
departures of Russell Maryland, Darrin
Smith and Super Bowl MVP Larry Brown.
Their run defense is the most glaring
weakness. I remember watching the Dallas
defense in 1993, and no team could run on
them. It was impossible. They would hold
teams to miniscule rushing yards and then
force them into third-and-longs. The boys
would then unleash their nasty pass rush, led
by Charles Haley (who is now injured indef-
initely), causing multiple turnovers and
sacks. They were unbeatable. '
Their offense still has that huge offen-
sive line blocking for Ernrnitt Smith and
Troy Aikman passing to Deion and the pre-
viously drug-suspended Michael Irvin.
However, a solid defense can shut them
down, as the Steelers demonstrated in the

Men's and women’s crew feel confident about their performances last weekend.

Crew competes in Head of the Ohio

Robertson

 

The Pittsburgh crew team participat-
ed in the 10th armual Head of the Ohio
Regatta in downtown Pittsburgh this

Saturday. Many gathered to watch crew ‘

teams from all over the United States
compete on the Allegheny. Both the men
and women participated in the regatta and
performed well for their first race. 3

The fall season of rowing consists of
all head races, where the boats compete
against time for about 5,000 meters. The
spring season consists of sprint races
which are ’_500 meters in length. Boats
compete against each other more than
time.

 
 

“This race was just a stepping stone,”
said Greg Egnor, coach of the women’s
team. “We are looking to build up this
semester and prepare for our spring sea-
son.”

The women’s team entered a light-
weight eight, an open eight, an open four
and an open double. The lightweight eight
came in 10th out of 17 and the open eight
came in 11th out of 14. Coach Egnor was
pleased with the fact that the varsity
women went from a competitive four last
semester to two competitive eights this
semester. Egnor is focusing on building
up the eights, since these are the boats that
will prove to be strong in the spring.

The men’s team entered a lightweight
eight, an open eight, a lightweight four

and an open four. The lightweight eight
took a bronze, coming in four seconds
behind Dowling College and 18 seconds
behind Cornell. These times were excel-
lent considering the experience that both
Dowling and Cornell have over
Pittsburgh’s young team. The lightweight
four came in fourth out of 22, and only
two seconds away from third place.
“The boats did really well this race.
The team as a whole is very young,” said
Todd Ridenour, head coach of the Pitt
crew team. “We are working on rebuild-

ing the team since we have had a different p

head coach for each of the last four years.
That upsets the balance the team starts to
gain.” ‘

Well, no one should be surprised that
Baltimore ousted Cleveland from the play-
offs — they have a better lineup and better
pitching. Now they face the American
League’s most formidable starting rotation in
the New York Yankees, who behind Bernie
Wrlliarns stormed past the Texas Rangers.

First Base: Baltimore’s Rafael
Palmeiro vs. New York’s Tino Martinez.
Palmeiro put up a solid effort against the
Indians hitting a key homenm in the Game 4
-clincher. His 142 RBIs have been clutch all
season for the Orioles and look for him to
play a big part in this series. Martinez has
ﬁlled in admirably for Don Mattingly in his
ﬁrst year with the Yanks. He was relatively
quiet in their 3-1 series drubbing of the Texas
Rangers. Each however, are established
clutch hitters. EDGE: BALTIMORE

Second Base: Roberto Alomar vs.
Mariano Duncan. Get out the spit shields
when Alomar steps to the plate. On the seri-
ous side though, Alomar knows what it takes
to win, having won back-to-back tiﬂes in
Toronto. He provides positive leadership to a
team that hasn’t gone this far into the playoffs
since 83. He’s fought off national criticism
and delivered the game-tying hit, plus the
garne-winning homer in game 4 against the
Indians. Duncan is a free-swinger and can hit
nothing but fastballs. If you throw him any-
thing else he won’t touch it EDGE: BAL-

Pitching: Any series usually rests on the

Orioles lack quality pitching. They don’t
have a dorrrinant closer and middle relief has
been a problem. When manager Davey

the Indians, he played like Mitch Williams. If

they do that against the Yanks, they will lose. ‘
New York’s staff is awesome. With David {

(Kathy. Segal

The science of nutrition is continually
evolving and imperfect. Specialists still
can’t agree on the best way to make the
human body burn fat as energy and how to
keep it off. Nonetheless, labels and the

information they provide can help you-

choose food that is healthier.

-The FDA requires all packaged and
pre-prepared food of any kind to list along
with its name the ingredients, with the
ingredient present in the greatest amount
by weight ﬁrst. Also listed is the net
weight, or weight of the contents.

The label also can include, but doesn’t
have to, nutritional infomration. But, if it
does, it must include it in a standardized
format.

If a claim is made. that a food is
“dietetic” or “low calorie”, then the

i processor must include a nutritional label

to substantiate the claim. This also means a
speciﬁed portion size. All the information

on that panel has to be based on that por— ,

, tion size. So if the portion or serving size is
6 oz., and the package is 18 oz., the label
must say that the package contains three

‘ servings per package and include the calo-
ries per portion.

The nutrition label also must include
the amount of protein, fat, and carbohy-
drate in grams per serving. It may also
include information about cholesterol or
sodium content, but that is not part of the
standard format. However, if a claim is
made that the food item is low sodium or
low cholesterol, then the manufacturer
does have to include information about

A sodium or cholesterol on the label.

Just remember, simply because this

p information is listed doesn’t necessarily
mean it is favorable. If the grams of fat
exceed the grams of protein, put it back on
the shelf.

For example, two tablespoons of Jif
extra-crunchy peanut butter claim to have
no cholesterol. This is true; however, Jif is
very high in fat and calories, and is an
incomplete source of quality protein. Since
the cholesterol claim is made on the label,

{I the remaining nutritional information must

 also be printed. Inspection of that informa-

 tion reveals that that particular peanut but-

 ter has 16 grams of fat per serving and 190

l calories per tablespoon.

" Wow! If you’re trying to reduce fat or
lose weight, chuck the chunky Jif and

, switch to Breyer’s Lite Ice Milk, which has

only 36 calories (four grams) of fat per
serving.

Below is a list of label deﬁnitions that
should help you make healthy food choic-
‘es should you be concerned with nutrition
and ﬁtness enhancement.

”  Lite —— Can refer to color, taste, tex-
L

, calories, or weight. Lite olive oil for

‘lalwristance, is milder in ﬂavor and lighter in

HEALTH & FITNESS

Scrap the Jif,

  

I THE PITT NEWS

 

it's too fatty

color than regular olive oil, but the fat and
the calories are the same.

Natural Any product can be
labeled “natur ” by any manufacturer,
which of course does not make it more
healthful.

100 percent pure —— “I00 percent
pure” means the product consists of a sin-
gle ingredient.

Organic “Organic” usually
irnplies that no synthetic fertilizers or pes-
ticides were used when growing, process-
ing or packaging the food, but this deﬁni-
tion is not backed by federal law.

‘ Lean — No more than 10 percent fat
by weight. ,

Extra lean — No more than 5 percent
less fat than the original product.

Leaner —— At least 25 percent less fat

than the original product.

Dietetic —- One or more "ingredients
(usually sodium or sugar) has been
changed, substituted or restricted. Not nec-
essarily low in calories.

Sugar-free/sugarless —— Contains no
sucrose (table sugar), but might contain
corn syrup, fructose, honey, sorbitol or
other sweeteners. Not necessarily low in
calories. .

Very low sodium — No more than 35
milligrams of sodium per serving.

Low sodium — No more than 140
mg sodium per serving.

Reduced sodium — At least 25 per-
cent less sodium than the original product.

No salt added and salt-free — No
salt added in processing. However, the
food could have signiﬁcant amounts of
natural sodium, or sodium ﬁom other
sources such as soy sauce or preservatives.

Low in calories ‘— No more than 40
calories per serving and no more than 0.4
calories per gram.

Reduced calories — One-third fewer
calories than the product it most resembles,
except meat and poultry, which must con-
tain 25 percent fewer calories than similar
products. , -

No cholesterol -—— Currently, no legal
definition. Remember, though, that a prod-
uct labeled no or low cholesterol may still
contain saturated fats that raise blood cho-
lesterol, and that this label does not mean
“no fat.”

Enriched — The replacement of
nutrients lost in the manufacturing process.
The most common is the addition of vita-
mins B1, B2, B3, and iron to reﬁned grain.

Fortiﬁed -— The addition of nutrients
to foods that did not originally contain
them. The additions of vitamins A and D to
milk, iodine to salt, and vitamins or miner-
als to cereals are examples.

Super Bowl.

This team is no longer feared by the NFL.
They are beatable, and teams like the Steelers,
Packers, 49ers and Colts know  Green Bay was
outscored in a shoot—out for the NFC
Championship last year. They scored at will on
Dallas, but their defense was suspect This year
their defense is much improved and their offense is
still one of the best in the league behind the reign-
ing MVP Brett Favre.

If Green Bay doesn’t dethrone Dallas, some-
one will and it will be wonderful. I’m tired of the
loudmouthed, arrogant, showboaling Cowboys.
First, there is Head Coach Barry Switzer, who
reminds me of a foul-mouthed weasel. He can’t
admit when he makes a coaching mistake like the
fom‘th—and—a-foot, as he called it, against the Eagles
last year which cost them the game.

FROM PAGE 8 

Then there is Neon Deion, who will show off
whenever he gets a chance. He is ﬂashy and ﬁm to
watch at times, but he plays football like a wussy.
Watch Deion when he goes for a tackle. He never
hits; even quarterbacks bowl him over.

Finally, there is “The Playmaker,” Micheal
Irvin. Here is a real classy guy. He cheated on his
wife and snorted coke for years, and when he got
caught he shed a tear so people would feel sorry for
him. Yeah, I feel sorry for a guy who is a multi-mil-
lionaire and plays a childhood game for his job. If
only we could all be this lucky.

The Cowboys go against everything that is .

good about sports. They thinkythey are above the
NFL and the rest of the sports world. I will rejoice
when they lose, and so should every sports fan.

Matt Townsend is a columnist for The Pitt News.

Crew

The Pitt crew team also had
their novice team at the race to sup-
port them. The novices didn’t have
enough experience to race in Head
of the Ohio, but will participate in
upcoming regattas.

“Our novices look solid in
practice, and so far we have three
women’s eights and one men’s
eight,” said Egnor. -

The crew team still has regat-
tas left in Boston, Ma.; Virginia;
and Ohio. This Saturday the team
is participating in a Row-A-Thon.
The team gets paid a certain
amount of money per mile, and
they are rowing for twenty miles.
The event will take place on all

three rivers in Pittsburgh. It will
begin at the Three Rivers
Boathouse and go down the
Allegheny to the Monongahela and
then to the Ohio. I

The Row-A-Thon will be an
intersquad row, which means men,
women, novice, and varsity will be
combined in each eight. The pro-
ceeds will go to purchasing a new
boat for the team. They are hoping
to raise about $6,000 to $7,000.
This is the ﬁrst Row-A-Thon the
team has held and they hope for it
to become a tradition in years to
come. Anyone wishing to sponsor
