An unemployed college
graduate took his frustrations to
thestreet Saturday, as he armed
himself with asix-inch hand gun
and ‘robbed the Forbes Ave. 7-
Eleven. - ‘

Louis Williams, 27, of Oakland,
entered the store at 9:45 a.m. and
asked cashier Diane McCune if
he could get change for a dollar.
An unideiitified customer gave
Williams change. Williams then
told the customer, “I’m going to

buy something anyways," and he
' a p proa ched

the counter,
according to the police report.
Williams then pulled out his
hand gun and said, “Give all of
your money right now.” McCune
stepped away from the counter
and gave him $20. After searching
the register and finding it empty,
Williams ﬂed, according to the
police report.
“After she put the money in the
bag, I took the bag off the counter
‘and ran out of the store onto
Forbes Avenue. I then ran up. the
steps and through the Towers
[lobby] and onto Fifth Avenue,”
Williams said in a statement to

A the police’. 

after being arrested at 1 p.m. that
day.

Before the arrest he was seen
by city police officer Harold

Drummond, who was on patrol _‘

at Pitt Stadium, retrieving a hand’
gun from some bushes."
Drummond called for backup and
pursued‘ Williams in a marked
car. Another office'r on a
motorcycle ‘joined the ‘chase for

‘Williams.

Drummond pursued Williams
down Terrace St. to Robinson St.
After catching up with Williams,
Drummond searched his bag and
discovered the pistol. Drummond

_recognized Williams from the

description of the 7-Eleven robber
and placed him under arrest on
charges of robbery and
possession of a_ concealed
weapon, according to the police
report. .

Williams explained his actions
in his confession statement to the
police.

Many of the questions I get

to do when one falls out of love.
The concerns most often seem to
focus on how to attract or maintain
someone else’s love.

Questions of this nature are the
hardest to answer because they I

Men and women who feel

Consequently, the kind of people

the groundwork for later

The reason falling in love or
staying in love is such a common
concern is that most of us are
conditioned early in life to believe
that being without a love partner
is a personal disaster which
insures a lifetime of unhappiness.
It is true that intimacy with
another person is enriching-and
it is certainly worth pursuing, but
it is also true that real intimacy
rarely occurs between people
who aren’t capable of achieving
happiness on their own.

or personal problems change will
not occur until you take the first
step.

One way to begin is to commit
yourself to believing that a
worthwhile person resides within
you who is capable of finding
personal happiness. Reﬂect on
the qualities in yourself that you
really like, and determine to work
on those that need attention. Take
note of those things you do well
on your own or that you initiate
with friends. Come to believe that
you are an independent and
capable person. You can find

help in facilitating this process

through individual counseling,
by joining a support group and
even by reading some of the
relevant self-help literature. The
chapter on “Love Addiction” by
David Burns in his book, Feeling
Good, is particularly helpful.

Loving someone else and being
loved in return is a desirable goal.
Valuing yourself first, however, is
the fastest and the healthiest way
to get there. ' A

Roy’s declines participation in CLEAN conservation program

By Gary Knapick

Staﬂ“ Writer

Members of the Concerned
Leaders for Environmental Action
Now were disappointed but not
disheartened yesterday when
group officers announced that
Pitt's Roy Rogers declined an
invitation to participate in “Mug
Yourself.”

Mug Yourself, CLEAN’s newest
conservation effort, is designed
to help participating eateries cut
down on Styrofoam use. The
establishments, whose names will
be printed on a reusable plastic
mug sold by CLEAN, will give a
10—percent discount to students

who use the mugs in lieu of the ’

disposable cups.
Dean Focareta, president of
CLEAN, said that even after he

offered to remove the 10-percent _
incentive discount, Roy Rogers’ .

management was still
unreceptive. “I think they just
don’t want to be bothered with
it,” Focareta said.

Jim Fossick, one of two
managers at the Oakland Roy
Rogers, said he never spoke to
CLEAN officers but the idea
sounded, like a good one.

“I don’t see that being a
problem. It would certainly cut
down on costs,” Fossick said.

Fossick said that if a restaurant ‘

manager refused, it was only
because “it was his job to say no.”
Fossick added that such a change

could be implemented only
through proper channels.
According to officers, CLEAN
will continue to ask for the
participation of other local
restaurants, including
McDonald’s, Schenley Cafe, Rax
and Arby’s. .
Methods of raising enough
capital to put Mug Yourself into
action includedthe sale of mug
space for advertisements, baked
goods, and fruit kabobs. CLEAN
estimated it will cost $500 to
implement the program.
CLEAN addressed other
projects at their meeting.

Pitt sexual harassment policy defined

   

By Lisa Tylak

For The Pitt News

The recent Senate judiciary hearings
‘regarding Anita Hill’s sexual-harassment
charges against Judge Clarence Thomas

have left many Americans, including people ' _

on Pitt’s campus, wondering exactly what

” sexual harassment is. _

According to a booklet distributed by the
Ofﬁce of Affirmative Action, Pitt’s definition
of sexual harassment is: any unwelcome
sexual advance, request for sexual favors or
other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature when:

0 Submission to such conduct is an explicit
or implicit condition of employment or

»academic success

-Submission to or rejection of such
conduct is used as the basis for an
employment or academic decision

-Such conduct has the purpose or effect
of unreasonably interfering _ with an
individual’s work or academic performance
or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive work or academic environment

According to Elaine Frampton, assistant
director of affirmative action, sexual
harassment is hard to deﬁne.

“There’s no clear lines. It’s such a difﬁcult,
difficult issue,” Frampton said.

The cases that are not that hard to define,
such as a teacher demanding sex for grades,
are rare, according to Frampton. In the last
five or six years, Frampton said she has only
seen about five such cases.

In the last year only 52 sexual-harassment
complaints and inquiries were recorded at
the office. Of those complaints, only 14
were filed. '

Frampton said women are probably more
willing to come forward now than ever
before because of guidelines that now exist.

However the victim still experiences fear
and embarrassment, Frampton said.,

“They feel that they caused it somehow,
which is not true," Frampton said.

Even fewer men than women come
forward about this sensitive issue. Of the 32
complaints and inquiries in the past year,
only one was ﬁled by a man.

“Men tend to tease, ‘Oh I wish I were

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, October 22, 1991

sexually harassed,”’ Frampton said, adding
that they would not think that way if it
really happened to them.

If someone experiences sexual
harassment, Frampton recommends the
victim write down everything that happened
and contact her office. She said there is
always some action taken, even if it is just
sitting down and talking to the alleged
perpetrator.

“I give people options — how they can
handle it themselves if they want to and
what would happen if they filed a formal
complaint,” she said. ,

“If you’re not sure about something, talk
to a peer about it,” said Mary Wivell, co-
president of the Campus Women’s
Organization. She offered this advice to
people on both ends of the situation,
saying that there is nothing wrong with
getting another opinion on any situation.

“The fact is this shouldn’t even happen,
but it does,” Wivell said,” [but] I think that
the more these issues are aired and the
more attentionthey get from the media, the
better it will get.” 1

There is also a possibility that
he might not win the election.
According to Theresa Wilson, the
SGB elections chair, a person can
still run for the board or the
presidency if he or she submits
an official, sealed transcript to the
office of student activities at least
24 hours before the election.

Any person interested in doing
so must have a QPA of at least

2.5. Any person submitting a
transcript would be eligible for
election as a write-in candidate,
according to Wilson.

This is not the first time a
president has run unopposed. In
1988 Kent Baldauf assumed the
presidency without having to
campaign against anyone.

Because there is only one
candidate, the elections
committee and the SGB have
been concerned about poor voter
turnout. In an effort toincrease
turnout, the SGB has placed a
number of referendums on the
ballot, such as a proposed North
Oakland shuttle and a $1 tuition
increase to fund study—abroad
programs.

SGB President Brent Saunders
has encouraged students to “Go
out and vote so you can be heard.”

Golden said that as president
he will continue the work that he
has already started as an SGB
board member this year.

Golden said, “Don’t deny'me
your vote because I’m your only
candidate.”

increased, government money is
not as available for part—time
students, Bolvin said.

“We are always looking for
new programs we might offer to
fit the needs of students in the
workplace,” Bolvin said. He said
the CGS administration is working
hard to recruit and encourage the
retention of students.

The CGS administration is
working on a master recruiting
plan, according to Anne
Levenson, associate dean of CGS.

“We try to make access to our
programs as easy as possible,”
she said. “That is why students

are able to register on the 9th
floor of Kaufmann’s [downtown].
We want students to feel that
they don’t have to battle their
way in,” Levenson said.

Levenson points to the
demographics of the community
as one possible factor in the
decline in enrollment.

“The population of Allegheny
County is aging,” she said, “and
the economy is such that many
people just don’t feel they can
afford" college any more.”

There have been so many
layoffs in recent years, and
companies are not offering as
much in the way of tuition

reimbursement as they once did,

Levenson said. She also cited.

rising tuition as a factor.

Robert Comfort, associate dean
of CGS, blamed the enrollment
decline in part on the fact that
fewer students are taking post-
baccalaureate courses.

“Years ago we had many more

teachers taking courses for

permanent certification,” he said.

Comfort said the enhancement
of recruiting and promotion
should help , to attract new
students, and good service should
help keep them. “We need to try
to keep the students happy,” he

said.”We need to listen to their
concerns.”

Marcie Roberts, president of
the CGS Student Government
Council, agreed that rising tuition
and reduced financial aid may be
factors in the decline but added
that she thinks the recent adverse
publicity the university has been
getting is also a factor.

“Non-traditional students may
be more concerned about how
their tuition money is spent than
traditional students,” she said.
“Often we are not only paying
our own tuition but supporting
the school through taxes as well.
I personally know of three people

who left Pitt because of ‘the
scandals."

Roberts said that non-traditional
students often hold full-time jobs
and have families as well.
“Because of other pressures in

their lives, it doesn’t take much to v

discourage some non-traditional
students,” she said.

The Student Government
Council is trying to find ways to

make the path to Pitt easier. It is _ '

exploring the possibility of phone-
in registration and working with
the Coalition for Child Care at Pitt
to encourage the University V to
expand child—care options for
students who are parents.

.\To ban or not to ban.”

 In light of the recent murder of 22 people-in Texas last
week, the subject of gun control was once again raised in

I the House of Representatives.

Although the Senate had already passed the ant,i—crime
bill and President Bush advocated the legislation, Ilouse
members voted overwhelmingly to oppose the ban on

' semiautomatic weapons.

Since this is the first anti-weapon bill that has been

proposed in years, it"isian accomplishment that it even -

proceeded to the House. Not all of the items included in
the bill were opposed, however. The Brady l3ill,"which
has forced a seven—day waiting period on the purchase of
a handgun, was approved, and it is hoped that the
proposal byjames Brady, ex-White I louse press secretary
will somehow be incorporated into an anti—crime package.
Some supporters ofthe anti-weapon bill rescinded their
opinions after George I Iennard, ofllelton, Texas, entered

Iv‘ a cafeteria and killed 22 people with a 9mm semiautomatic

pistol from Austria. The weapon is commonly known as
the (‘ilock-I7 and is often used for props in movies, such
as l)z'e I Ian! 2, according to ’/be l’z'tzsburg/9 Press.

’lbe New York 'l'z'mes reported that Democrat Chet
I-Edwards of’I‘exas told other representatives ofthe I louse,
“l’,)on’t let the tragedy in my district yesterday be the
tragedy in your neighborhoods tomorrow. We can not
bring back the lives ofthe 22 citizens lost yesterday. But
-with your vote, we canﬂsave some lives.” Iidwards had
previously-opposed the ban.

The vote against ‘eliminating the =(}lock—I7 and the
maga‘/.ine (or multiple—bullet gun—clip) which loads it_ was

I I justified by members of the Ilouse, who claimed the

‘proposed bill would not guarantee that an episode such
as the one in Texas would not occur again.

As always, the violation of second amendment rights
was questioned by National Rifle Associationxmembers.
The Second Amendment, in its original form, is being
infringed upon by the anti-weapons bill in the fact that it
is suggesting the restriction of specific gun purchases.

The Bill of Rights states that: “a well-regulated militia,

’ — being necessary to the security ofa free state, and the right

of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.” '

Considering _the rise of crime and deaths that are
accountable to weapons, this amendment is clearly

outdated. Although it should not be completely ignored ’

or changed to suit today’s society, the safety ofthe people
of the United States should not be placed in jeopardy.
Situations with extenuating circumstances such as the
slayings in Texas should prompt our government to take

action against weapons which are obviously endangering
' the lives of innocent humans. ’

Freedom of speech has been restricted in certain cases
since the I-‘irst Amendment was originally written. If this
right may be infringed upon, and freedom of speech has
never been known to kill anyone, then there is no
justification for the IIouse’s 2/l7—l77 vote against the ban
‘of semiautomatic weapons. '

The Vietnam Memorial in

»\\'v’ashingt0n, D.C., has always got

this strange aura around it which
gives you a feeling like you’re a
half—step behind yourself, like
you’re seeing something again

but for the first ‘time.

Near it is a book listing the
names ofall the men and women
who died in the Vietnam War, as
well as where they are on the
\\"all — this section, that section,
all depending on when they died,
or the best estimation anyway.
The book is arranged
alphabetically by the last name of
the deceased.

One day on a whim, I looked
up “Winters.” I found my entire
name: Winters, Christopher
Micltael. It’s like finding your
hame in the obituary section —

not just your first and last name, ’

which would be curious or even
unsettling, but your entire name,
leaving you touching yourself to
make sure you do indeed still
breathe.

Iinstinctively read this other
Chris’ day of death, looking for
some mystical connection—what
if he died on the same dayl came
to be? I was born in the beginning
of 1970, joyfully oblivious to Nixon
and napalm.

The possibility zipped through
my mind ofa faraway soul coming
to rest in my own body just when
I gulped my first breaths of air,
crying from that first smack ofmy
ass.

\\'/hat ifthis other Chris Winters .

was psychotic and he took over
my body? What if, what if, what if?

But for better or worse, life is
neither a movie nor a book. Ile
died in the middle of 1972, in‘
_Iune if I remember correctly, right
around the time I was spitting up
mashed green peas and burbling
along with my Fisher Price record
player.

People always look for reasons

Chris
Winters

to explain why they are the way
they are. Why else would Oprah
be around for so long?

Recently, out of the blue, I
remembered seeing “Winters,
Christopher Michael” in that big
book (and it is a big book), and
it got me thinking about names,
about the act ofnaming. It’s quite
a powerful notion.

If you know .the name of
something, you automatically
know what you’re talking about.
You can use big words and talk
about “dialectical materialism,”
and people think you know
something they don’t all because
you know the name. Cite books,
and people will believe whatever
you say because you’ve
remembered the title, the name.

It’s strange, but I think itcomes
from T1'me—maga7.ine sensibilities
olfpoliticsandculture. Timeis the
Showplace for new mass-culture

happenings, like the Lambada,»

cold fusion and those vegetable-

/shaped Swatches that rich

collectors pay homeless people
to buy for them.

Until all this PC stuff had a
name, nobody talked about it.
(Maybe they did, and nobody
noticed.) But afterward lots of
news Weeklies all had it on_their
covers, like the thing had sprung
up overnight, some gigantic
rutabaga of controversy.

Furthermore, if something has
a name, then the people who
believe in that something all have
names as well. If you believe in
‘multiculturalism,’ you’re
automatically a member of the
PC Thought Police. Never mind
any gray areas or intelligent
discussion, because another

Images conjarea’ by namesoften oa’a’

property of names is that they
tend to stick, no matter how hard
the named tries to exert its
tellonness. ,

Once tagged, it’s impossible to
break out except through some
strange, unexplainable, born-
again procedure where beliefs
are altered into something
radically different overnight ——
also known among conservatives
as the “Warren Syndrome.”

Presidential candidates are ripe
fortagging, but always remember
these a_re people rather than
platforms. A

Maybe in the coming months
you’ll hear meaningful talk about
a national health-care system and
other things the Bush
administration won’t touch with
a 10-foot Sununu, and Bush
himself will angrily respond to
charges of an unfeeling health
policy with an I Eisenhower-like
charge of “creeping socialism” or
some such label, tagging back his
accusers.

I know the name ofChristopher
Michael Winters. I know when
he was born and when he died,

but I don’t know anything about V

him.
.\ Through his name—— his mere
name —— I’ have this odd

association with him, fromhim. I
don’t understand it, but that’s the
power of naming.

Maybe I'm making too big of a
dealabout a name in a book. Yet
all the images and ideas he brings
up —— from the war, from youth
unfulfilled, from death and pain
— are things which have the
power to pluck that violin string
running down the center ofnearly
everyone, producing a’ sweet
melody in some but in others
twanging an awful, unavoidable
dissonance.

Cbris Winters is a senior
majoring in bistory.

Apathy is out. Letters to the editor are in.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, October 22, 1991

 

Mark Smith

With another National Coming Out
Day (Oct. 11) behindus, confusion
between two distinct phrases becomes
apparent again. ‘

Coming outis about taking your next
step: being honest concerning sexual-
orientation issues. Coming out is
voluntary and empowering. The
metaphor is one we have all heard -
coming out of the closet — and I do
recognize its importance.

Most often it’s gaypeople who “come
out.” It would be silly for heterosexuals
to “come out” since the society we live

unless otherwise noted. Coming out
has been important for the lesbian, gay
and bisexual communities; it has broken
down stereotypes and allowed lesbian,
gay and bisexual people to live without
having to lie about the people they
love. As a populargay— liberation sticker
states, “Free to Be.”

The next term needs to be defined:
Outing. Outing refers to disclosing a
person’s sexual orientation against his
or her wishes; this of course only
makes sense when applied to non-
heterosexuals. Closeted homosexuals
and bisexuals are more common than
typos in a term paper, so outing can
exist. Just because someone has been
outed does not indicate whether the
person is homosexual or bisexual. In
many cases, I have my doubts.

Some people wantto out individuals
to show the world that gays are
everywhere. Flyers in New York outed
Jodie Foster, Tom Selleck,John Travolta

alleged the claim: “absolutely queer.” I
don’t see the point of including people
in the gay communities if they don’t
want to be there, even if they are gay.

Flyers have appeared in the local

in assumes everyone to be heterosexual.

and other celebrities. These flyers all '

Hypocrisy justifies outing
of specific public figures

area identifying “queer outlaws.” They
seem to have been focusing on cartoon
characters. Poles around the Cathedral
of Learning allege Ernie and Bert are
lovers. Hypothetically, I can believe
this about Ernie and Bert — they have
been living together for over 20 years.

Political outings seem to elicit media
attention. Outed in a big way this
summer was Assistant Secretary of
Defense Pete Williams. Williams, who
Americans saw frequently during press
conferences concerning the Persian Gulf
crisis, was outed on the front page of
one of the country’s oldest gay
periodicals, The Advocate.

Outing, as a tool for change, is
questionable. The Department of
Defense’s anti—gay policy hurts gays in
the service. Suicide, harassment and
disruption of daily life are just some of
the consequences. The fact that a top
DOD boss is alleged to be homosexual
makes the military sexual—.orientation
discrimination policy look ridiculous.
However The Advocates evidence is
thought-provoking —— from the
spending of Williams’ time at gay D.C.
bars to his dining with a staffer from the
country’s largest gay—rights organization
in his home, the evidence is confusing.
Williams and others have remained
quiet about the issue, only offering-the

usual “privacy” arguments. Ironically,-

the DOD rejects a privacy argument for
enlisted military personnel. ‘ 7

In this case it was the politically savvy
thing to do. But what about the next

case? Outing makes homosexuality or.

bisexuality look dirty; it sensationalizes
the gay community.

I can’t see outing the average Jane
lesbian orJoe Gay. But in an age when
government inaction and medical
bureaucracy furthers the AIDS crisis,
gay bashings are on the rise, lesbians
lose custody of their children and a
recent example ofthe military anti—gay
policy led to a murder, it’s not surprising
that desperate people are outing people
such as Pete Williams. For them,
Williams represents a coward standing
on the sidelines while others suffer.

, Mar/e Smith isa colamnistfor’1’he Pitt
News.

After a particularly stressful day last
week I was up in ThePz'ttNewS office doing
the usual office things (typing, complaining
and ignoring the sports department), when
a co—worker suddenly announced to the
newsroom: ‘‘I’m going to Schenley. Anyone
want anything?”

It was at that point when someone
called out, “Get me a chicken combo,” that
‘I began thinking about the popularity of
the chicken combo.

In fact, the chicken combo is so popular
that, according to a Schenley cafeteria
spokesperson, they sell approximately 230
combos a day. ' '

Since I have choice dollars, I basically
survive on the chicken combo and small
tossed salad. Who looks at the numbers
that miraculously appear on the register? I
didn’t even know how much a chicken
combo cost on ‘its own until I decided to
do this column. (lt’s.$2.2S.)

.But o_f course,’ there is a reason I didn’t
know the actual price of my most—ordered
meal. And yes, that reason is beverage!

Yes, beverage is a necessity with the
chicken combo.;It’s not that the combo is
dry and pasty and needs to be washed
down. , ,

In fact, flavor ‘can be added to the
combo in a variety ‘of ways — but we’ll get
to that later.

We were discussing beverage. It is my
observation that Schenley Cafe carries one
of the most extensive lines of beverage on

A campus.

First, we’ve got the basic soft drinks:
coffee, tea, hot chocolate, ‘milks (which
went well with the now—invisible, Hostess
racks), Whip’r Snap’r’s and last but not
least, the full line of Taylor’s (fruit punch,
iced tea and lemon and grape drinks).
Don't forget the Mistics or the Everfreshes.

And the justification for the vast selection
of liquids? g

Easy. It is my hypothesis that the Schenley
folks know that there are students out
there like me who have their own top-
your-own combo system that we would
never dare stray.from. Therefore we need
a little variety for our basic, everyday
thirst. '

Back to the topyou r-own combo system.
~ This is an element of lunch and
dinnertime feasting that deserves some
discussion, since everyone has their own
system of topping their chicken sandwich
or fries.

Pitt students load combos? 
with ‘condiment affection’ 

 

 

 

  Lisa Raff

First, let’s discuss the sandwich po,rt_ion  ’

of the combo. There’s a system for
everyone. Trust me. ’
Eric Larkin, a Pitt senior, said heprefers

a slice of provolone cheese, lettuce and '

[Ol'I‘13[O.

Others are a little more daring. Jeff

Rosenthal, another Pitt senior, tops his

sandwich with mustard and provolone.-
But, silly me, I’m forgetting an important

part Of the combo! '

Along with its poultry counterpart, ’

Schenley fries deserve just as" much
“condiment affection.” J . -
Pitt senior Keith Walker tops his fries

with a liquid combination ofgravy, cheese,

mustard,‘ mayo and ketchup. Salt and
pepper, Walker said, are‘ not necessary.

However the real mystery ofthe chicken 1
_combo is the jello. For the past week or-so,

it’s been excessively watery, but before

then the jello was a major form of’

entertainment. ' .

For example, let’s say it’s two weeks ago
and you’re eating combos with somepne
you don’t have much to say to.

The jello (in its convenient plastic

container) can be used as an excellent

tension breaker.-All you have to do is turn
the container upsidedown and tap the
bottom of it. The jello almost never falls
and is always fascinating to watch. .
Back to the toppings. 'lhe contest, known
from here on out as “Are you more daring?”
has begun. -
Students wishing to enter should ‘send
their names, phone numbers and detailed
descriptions of their fixins through campus

Views on homosexuality na

“We would like to address Eric
Wenger’s letter regarding the
Bible’s view on homosexuality.

First and foremost, the Bible is
interpreted differently by all that
read it.

People will naturally
understand the word of God
within the framework of their
education, upbringing and moral
beliefs.

We do not understand,
however, how a “Christian” can
interpret the Bible to justify his
own bigotry. You, Mr. Wenger,
go out of your way to cite those
passages which can support your
narrow-minded, prejudiced
ideals.

Whatever happened to the all-
loving, all-forgiving God? Why
don’t you re-read the scriptures
and pay attention this time to the
instances in whichjesus forgives,
loves and accepts despite
violation of prescribed social
standards?

.What is your view of ‘Mary?

Magdalene? Who are you to cast
the first stone?

Jesus was not gay

The Pitt News provides nearly
daily coverage of overtly pro-
homosexual articles. Our
newspaper’s active involvement
with BiGala’s “recruiting drive” is
unprofessional and unacceptable.
I took affront at their most recent
“advertisement” entitled “Gays,
lesbians honor National Coming
Out Day.” _

On Monday, I was disgusted to
“discover,” according to
defrocked “minister” Hawk, “ 
Jesus was gay.” I, like many, was
shocked that anyone could say
such a thing; seeing it on the front
page of the university’s paper
incensed ‘me further. Who the

hell is this guy who claimsCh'rist _

was a queer? Does he believe
anyone considers his position

legitimate? He is obviously sick;.

however I must object to his
blasphemous transference of ‘his
own revolting practices onto our

I Lord. .

He claims, “Perhaps Jesus was
the ultimate bisexual.” Perhaps
“Minister” Hawk has somestra'nge
fantasies 

Our school newspaper prints
articles advocating homo-
sexuality.

It constantly presents pro-gay

thinking as the norm here; it has
become a deceptive forum for

gay propaganda.

I ask the students to’ demand
unbiased, reality-based
journalism. Don't permit- a
disturbed few to run our paper
with the intent of propounding

Get the facts straight

Journalists, like historians, are
expected to get the facts straight.
Therefore I—mus_t take issue with
a particularly egregious error
made repeatedly by staff writer
Gary Knapick in his Oct. 15 _
review of a lecture given at the
Law School by Cornell Professor
Martil Bernal.

Bernal is currently creating a
stir with his series “of works,
collectively titled Blacle Athena.
He argues that‘Greek — and

thus European —- civili’/ation was ' ’

much more heavily influenced

by Egyptian and Phoenician _
culture than is currently credited. _

A superficial reading of his
work —' or careless attention

given to his lecture — would '
f lead some. to believe that Prof.‘

rrow-minded, predjudiced

Berna! is also arguing that hlacle

African culture was at work, as ‘
Egypt is on the African continent, "
and therefore ancient Egyptians! .

must have been black.

Indeed, Knapick makes this
assumption, as hestates, “Berna!
said that  historians intentionally
excluded the role of hlacle

- Egyptians and Phoenicians in the

development of Greek
civilization.”
Prof. Bernal, however, never

made any such claim — either in;
his lecture, which I also attended,

or in his work. Instead he insisted

again and again that we really i

perhaps less controversial, claim

  Volleyball rolling toward Penn State showdown

Paul Diamond/T he Pitt News

Ann Marie Lucanie led the Pitt volleyball team to four Big East victories this past weekend.

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

Pitt volleyball heads for its
showdown with Penn State
Wednesday, on a roll after
winning all four of its matches
this past weekend.

“We played great, this past
weekend,” head coach Sue
Woodstra said. “One thing I told
the players was that we are really
firing on all pistons right now.”

Boston College saw that
firsthand as it stumbled into the
match with a 2-13 record. Pitt
easily dispatched the Eagles 15-
5, 15-8, 15-5.

The panthers had a solid .289
kill percentage. Ann Marie
Lucanie had a team-high 10 kills
and an outstanding .500 kill
percentage. Heather Hollands had
six kills and a .454 percentage.
Senior co—captain Sue Zonneville
played in only two games but
had six kills and a .750 percentage.
Setter Annemarie Mernagh led
the team with five digs. A

Senior Jennifer McEnroe led
the Eagles with eight kills,‘ a .421
percentage and seven digs.

Pitt had some problems in its
Saturday afternoon match at
Providence. -The team lost the
first game 7-15 before taking the
next three 15-5, 15-9, 15-6. The
Lady Friars actually had a better
kill percentage for the match (.184
to .167), but.that was due to the
first game, in which Providence
had nine kills and only one error,
while Pitt had six kills and 11

errors. Lucanie was tops again in ’

kills, with 14, and senior co-
captain Dee MacAulay had 12.
They tied for the team lead in
digs, with 17. Linda Zols had nine
digs, and Hollands had eight, but
each had more errors than kills.

“lThe first game] was our wake-
up call,” Woodstra said. “Ever
since the Big East came into
existence, Providence has given
Pitt trouble.”

First-year middle hitter Aileen
Koproski had nine kills and 17
digs for Providence. Sophomore
outside hitter Missy Dawson
chipped in seven kills and 15
digs. '

The Lady Friars were 12-5 and
ranked ahead of Pitt before their

two interceptions set up excellent
field position, and a stellar
defensive effort completely
stymied the Owls’ attack, shutting
them out until the final minutes.

With Pitt ﬁghtingfor its life in
the Metrodome, Keith Hamilton,
Ricardo McDonald and their
mates denied Minnesota any
breathing room, while bailing out
an inept offense. -

And then, of course, the
Maryland game. There were more

schedule. Lex Perkins and Doug
Whaley snuffed out the Terps’

Of course, not all of them were
there just to watch Pitt. Syracuse
is also on the list for many bowls
after its convincing win over
Florida. Saturday’s win did not
hurt its chances either.

“I made my’ plans to come up

to this game three or four weeks
ago,” said George Olsen,
Executive Director Emeritus of
the Gator Bowl. “This season has
been very enjoyable for both
teams and us.”

Cricket Musch, Executive
Director of the John Hancock
Bowl, agreed. “We’re certainly
looking at both of these schools,
and they’ve both been very
impressive, exciting teams.” _

The Panthers’ last bowl trip

. was to thejohn Hancock Bowl in

1989, when they defeated Texas
A&M 31-28. That game was Pitt
head coach Paul Hackett’s first
collegiate coaching victory. “We
had a great time with them,”
Musch said. “They provided a
great show, and I think that it was
that football game where Alex
Van Peltreally established himself
as a quality quarterback.”

Olsen said the Gator Bowl likes
to see teams that are balanced

offensively and defensively. “lThe ,

Panthers have] a good offense,
no question about it," he said.
“They’ll play all right with
anybody, and they’ve got a good
defense, too. We’re interested in
how they play defensively, too.
They might _score 30 points, but
we don’t want them giving up 50
either.” -

'I'HEPI'I'I‘ NEWS, Tuesday, October 22, 1991

I

 

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

The Pittsburgh Penguins raised
their 1991 Patrick Division, Wales
Conference and Stanley Cup
championship banners on
Saturday night, but the New York
Rangers" weren’t impressed.
Deﬁnitely jealous, though.

Mark Messier certainly wasn’t
impressed as he played his first
game as a Ranger in Pittsburgh.
The proud contributor to four
precious cups himself thanks to
the Edmonton Oiler dynasty days,
Messier would like nothing better
than to bring Lord Stanley to
Nuevo York, where its presence
hasn't been felt since 1940.
Penguin fans waited a long time,
but the Big Apple fans must be
really brown and soft on the
inside after being exposed for
that long.

The Rangers left the Pens feeling
mushy on Saturday night, as they
managed a late goal from Darren
Turcotte to move ahead of the
Pens in the Patrick standings at 5-
4, while the Pens fell to 4-2-1.

Remember the last time the
Rangers came to Pittsburgh? It
was late March, and N.Y. had just
given up first place to the streaking
Penguins. After three periods of
deadlocked hockey, the Pens got
a fluky overtime goal that
bounced off the boards and
behind the legs of John
Vanbiesbrouck and into the
Ranger cage.

The loss crushed the Rangers,
as they were taken in six games
by Washington in the Patrick
division playoffs.

So New York not only had
revenge on its mind but also a
point to prove. As defending Cup
champions, the Pens had better

be ready for Patrick rivals looking
to gun ‘em down.

The Islanders and Flyers tried,
but the Pens had too much for
the rebounding franchises. New
Jersey buried the Pens last
weekend, 4-1, and this time it
was the Rangers and their newly
revamped lineup. -

Again it was a ﬂuky goal that
determined the fates of these two
teams. With both teams tied at
four late in the third, Paul Broten
ﬂipped a puck at goaltender T om
Barrasso, but the puck took a
strange bounce and landed on
the stick of T urcotte, who slipped
the circle past Barrasso with just
over a minute remaining. The
goal eliminated yet another
stunning Penguin" comeback.
Trailing 5-1 entering the third,
the Pens struck quickly, as Kevin
Stevens tucked a Larry Murphy
rebound under Mike Richter. Joey

Mullen then fired his second goal
of the evening, a power-play tally
with 14 minutes left.

Rookie Soviet center Sergei
Nemchinov scored his second
goal of the game and fifth of the
season on a nifty backhand that
fooled Barrasso, butjaromir Jagr
answered for the Pens with his
third goal of the year with a—little
over three minutes remaining to

even the count at four. Turcotte _,

then proceeded to ruin the long-
awaited banner night in
Pittsburgh.

The Pens are having a lot of
trouble defensively. Paul Stanton,
Peter Taglianetti and Grant
Jennings seem to be in Scotty
Bowman’s doghouse, and even

Ulfsamuelsson is a -2 in the plus/ '

minus department.

Pittsburgh has given up five or
more goals in its last three games,
all to New York squads. The

Pitt hockey outshoots Duquesne in opener

By John Labriol
Staff Writer A

The Panther Hockey Club
opened its fall season last week
by defeating cross-town rivals
the Ice Dukes of Duquesne
University 10-8 at the Civic Arena.

Although Friday night’s contest
was only an exhibition game,
both teams proved that the level
of intense competition that has
always been apparent between
Duquesne and Pitt lives on in yet
another new crew of hockey
players.

The competition opened with
the Ice Dukes taking a quick,
two—goal lead over the Panthers.
Late in the first period Brent

Spitzer netted the Panthers’ first
goal of the night, with an assist
going to Bill Crousey.

At that point the Panthers began
to display the initiative needed to
pull ahead of Duquesne. The
Panthers opened the second
period by netting two consecutive
goals, giving Pitt a 3-2 lead. The
IceDukes netted two consecutive
goals to once again take the lead,
closing the scoring at 4-3 for the
remaining eight minutes of the
second period.

The Panthers opened the third
period by scoring two consecutive
goals to take a 5-4 lead over
Duquesne. Yet in true fashion of
this game, the Dukes came back
to tie the score with a goal netted

   
      

       

two minutes afterjCrousey’s (the
Panthers’ ﬁfth) goal.

For the next eight minutes of
play the score fluctuated with
each team leading an equal
amount of time. With 1:56
remaining in regulation time the
Panthers took a 9-8 lead. Don
Fendor scored off Vic‘ DiSanti
and Dave Koval.

At the 1:31 mark the Ice Dukes
took a chance that would prove
to be disastrous for them. To gain
an extra man on the ice, Duquesne
pulled its goaltender. With 31
seconds remaining in regulation
time the Panthers scored their
10th goal of the night and secured
their first victory of the season.

was Kip Linse, with assists going
to Crousey and Spitzer.

According to Pitt Coach Jeff I

Bele, the Panthers lack leg
strength, and their endurance was
"down. The level of skating
displayed by both teams was
good. Both had good form and
maneuverability, but both have
room for‘ improvement. Both
teams had adequate speed, but
both were lacking consistency,
except for where penalties were
concerned.

In Friday’s competition the ;

Panthers earned a net of 16
penalties for a total of 42 minutes.
The Ice Dukes were close behind
them with 14 penalties for a total
of 56 minutes. '

match. The Panthers took care of them 15-
11,’ 15-10,‘ 15-4 in what Woodstra called
the team’s best match of the weekend.

The weekend ended at the University of
Connecticut, which was 8-11 before
Sunday. The Panthers mauled the Huskies
15-1, 15-8, 15-2, with a very good kill
percentage of .342 compared to an
extremely weak .074 for Connecticut.
Hollands had eight kills and only one
error for a .467 percentage and five digs.
Lucanie played only two games and had
six kills.

Woodstra was able to find extensive
playing time for her bench. Senior Shelly
Seanor had the best match of the backups,
with seven kills and a team-high seven
digs. First-year outside hitter/middle hitter
Tracy Komar had three kills and five digs
in her ﬁrst playing time of the season.

The‘-Huskies had only 19 kills in the
match. Sophomore outside hitter Kim
Lobach had five of them and six kills.

Pitt's record now stands at 15-5, 4-0 in
the Big East. They have won nine straight
matches since losing four of five in late
September. The one loss that was not in

that streak was a ﬁve—game heartbreaker
in the season— opening match against
Penn State at Fitzgerald Field House. Penn
State is 14-3, not nearly as dominant as it
was last season. But there isn’t a single
player on the Pitt roster who has beaten
Penn State, including six seniors.

“The team was really focused on the
matches this weekend, but on the way
back we were thinking about Penn State,”
Woodstra said. “We are really up for this
match. It is the one match that no matter
what is at stake, both teams are going to
fight to the death to win.”

This unit has come up big time
and time again, ultimately
slamming the door each time it
had to. Until Saturday.

The Panthers forced the potent
Syracuse offense into six
turnovers, but this time it wasn’t
enough.rPitt fell to Syracuse 31-
27.

“We just had too many things

in the course of the ballgame get
away from us," said Pitt head
coach Paul Hackett. “It was a
tough day; it doesn’t come any
worse. How can you not win
when you get six turnovers? That’s
inexcusable.”

Although the six takeaways
resulted in 20 points for the
Panthers, the offense often
sputtered, especially when it

counted the most. Pitt’s defense

grew fatigued as the game wore
on and exhausted on the Orange's
final two drives. Syracuse owned
the football for nearly 39 minutes,
including 11 of the precious 15 in
the fourth quarter.

“I think the basic problem was
that the defense was on the field
too long,” Hackett said. “Anytime

becomes a fatigue factor down
the stretch that doesn’t have
anything to do with how hard
guys try.”

Syracuse’s punt figure for the
day, zero, and their third—down
conversion rate of 61 percent (11
of 18) contributed greatly in
wearing down the Panthers

“That hurt us,” McDonald said.
“You just can’t win like that. It
just prolongs the drives and makes
guys more and more fatigued.”

This defense has battled all
year, showing a fierce
determination every series.
Saturday, they met up with an
equally determined Marvin
Graves.

“He’s great. A guy like this you
just have to tip your hat to,”
McDonald said. “We tried
everything, but he just kept
battling back. Some quarterbacks
.would’ve just went in the tank,
but he kept battling back — the
great ones do.” i

Pitt’s fatigue factor magniﬁes
when chasing an elusive
quarterback of Graves’ caliber.
Graves overcame adversity all
day: fumble problems, forcing
the ball into coverage for two

interceptions and a relentless
beating from Sean Gilbert,
McDonald, Mike Kelly, Charles
Williams and a host of Panthers.
Trailing 27-17, Graves led the
Orangemen on marches of 70
and 73 yards in the final 12
minutes to pullout the victory.

“You have to give credit to
Graves; he’s very talented. He
took his team a long way,” said
defensive end Gilbert.

Despite its undying effort, the
Panther defense refused to pass

' the blame or point fingers at "the

offensive breakdown in the fourth
quarter. They stressedythat this
was a team effort, both in the
positives and the negatives.
“We made some big plays, and
our offense came down and
capitalized on most of them,”
said linebacker Tom Tumulty.
"Hackett made no excuses but
said he was very pleased that his

team played very hard to the end,

especially the tired defenders.

“The offense didn’t give the
defense time to regroup. You’re
very rarely gonna have your
defense get you six turnovers.
That was a tremendous job there,”
Hackett said.

Joseph Foner promised not to
be “annoying before and on
election day. I won’tbe knocking
on your door late at night to pass
out ﬂyers, and I won’t harass you
as you go to the Towers to conduct
your business.”

He also promised not to give
false promises that he will not be
able to keep. He stated that he
would like to see more people at
SGB meetings. “If elected, I want
to move the meetings to a larger
room so that more people can
attend. I also want people to
have the opportunity to" know
the board members,” he said.

Bryan Bender said his top
priority is public safety; “I plan to
improve communication. I want

to improve on- and off—campus_

safety programs and increase
student awareness about what
goes on in the university
community,” he said.

Bender said he would also like
to help get rid of student apathy
and see the course guide updated.

Barbara Rodriguez said she
plans to work closely with the
administration. “I will listen to all

student concerns. I would like to
openly and honestly discuss
student concerns with the
administration. One of my goals
is to initiate an open forum
between the president of the
university and the student body,”
she said. , .

Rodriguez also said she would
like to see the course guide
updated and see that all students
know what services are available
to them.

Daniel Leichter said, “The
university is an untapped
resource.. I want to enhance and
improve access to campus life for
all the students. I would also like
to see the choice dollars program
expanded.

“It would not necessarily be to
just food places but possibly other
stores as well. Using choice dollars
to pay for things would be a safer
alternative to carrying large
amounts of cash," Leichter said.
He also stated that he would like
to see a North Oakland shuttle
implemented. and have more bike

racks installed around campus.
Linda Kazmerski said she also
supports a North Oakland shuttle
and the expansion of choice
dollars. “I would also like to end
student apathy. I would like to
create a more unified campus
and make it a better place for
students and faculty,” she said.
Christopher Skutches said he
would. like to see increased
participation in all aspects of
student life. “By that I mean
membership in clubs, attendance
at games and all other aspects of
life at the university,” he said.
He also said he would like to
see better interaction between
the SGB and the students. “I feel
it must do more. I also plan to

continue the work of Andrew

Gould and Njugi Nginyo,”
Skutches said.’

, Abbie Campsie said, “The
voices of the students need to be

' heard. I found there is a need for

more student representation in
the administration, board of ‘
trustees and faculty,” she said:

Campsie would like to increase
student representation on those
committees.

Campsie also said she would
work to increase student
awareness of the activities
available to them and would also
like to see the Crime Stop program
enhanced. '

Ross Pasquale said he would
like to see the SGB help increase
campus safety. “I would like to
work with the city to increase the
number of officers and patrols in
Oakland. With the city budget

' cuts, they cut down on the police

force partially. We need to
increase safetyin Oakland," he
said.

Pasquale would also like to see
increased student involvement
and plans to work on that if
elected. If elected he said he
would like to form a committee

made up of members from all the '

campus organizations.

All of the candidates were given
five minutes to speak, and then
the floor was opened to questions.
