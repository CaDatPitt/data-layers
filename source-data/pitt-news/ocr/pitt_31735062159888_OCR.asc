  p-Xmas Dance

Jim Rock got underway today.
with plans for the first Commons
Room Christmas Dance, which is
slated for Dec. 14. - .

Rock received the nod_ as chair-
*‘man of the dance last week, when
the‘ Student Congress appoint-
ments committee named oﬁicer-s
for the all-student dance, second“

A in University history, to be held
in the'ﬁrst ﬂoor Gothic hall. '
‘ Ed Stone will serve as business
*--manager, ' and Al Bierman will
handle the publicity chairmanship
for the dance. Stone was on the
;business staff of last year’s Spring.

experience handling publicityfor
the 1951 Spring Carnival.‘  '

mination of an all—year Student
Congress campaign to ‘obtain=the

however,’ that while they have

room for that purpose. -,

» Indicationh ‘today are that the
sceptics on-‘the Boulevard might.
well be right." Plans for the new
Medical 'School Building are lan-'
guishing in the blueprint stage at
the present time, and Emery Jack-
sen, Pitt’s co—ordinating architect,
wouldn’t venture tosaywhen the
building might get started.

Dr. Edward C. Reif, dean of the
school of pharmacy, said that he
knows of no plans for improve-
ment of the present building or
faci_liti_es.- So the pharmacy‘ stu-
dents will "apparently have to go
along with what they have until
the medics _n1ove out, and that
seems to be ‘a long way. from now.

‘Standard joke of the students is

that they get excellent ‘practice in ‘

compounding medicines to heal
the splinter wounds suffered in
tryingto stay in their -_seats 'in_’03
hall.’ ‘

Donated in ‘I903

Donated by the class of -1903, it
is the educational center of the
school. But the future pharmacists
complain that the. 48 year old seats,
bad acoustics, pillars blocking their
view, and‘ tiny‘ writing arms" make

They are quick. to point out,

complaints with the building, they
are, on the whole,‘ more than sat-
isﬁed with the education ‘they are
receiving. “If our- facilities were
equal to the quality of instruction
we get,” a senior remarked, “this
would be the ﬁnest pharmacy
school in the nation.” ,

The students are also disgusted
with the parking situation. Em-
ployees of neighboring Mercy Hos-
pital compete with them every day
in a mad race to squeeze into the
two nearby parking lots. If they
are unlucky enough not to make it,
they then spend a half an hour or
more looking for parking space.

Full-time members of the University faculty have re-

\_two years, the. maximum raise willpbe $600.

This increaseis the ﬁnal chapter in a number of faculty
pay demands which began last February. Faculty spokesmen

at that time reported that the sal-
aries here were below national
and local averages for schools in
Pitt’s class.

According to the committee re-

Reveals Shortcomings

Instructors, the report says, will
be able to know just what their
-sho:rtc'omings are, and will be able
to make the time spent in class
more worthwhile.

The new plan,’ never before
tried here, proposes that every

in -each -of his classes. _

Cooperation Listed

deans of the schools of the Uni-

of experts in education and psy-
chology would be enlisted to pre-

- pare the rating sheets and to ar-
range for the best method of their
presentation and evaluation. '
The results would then be dis-
tributed to the faculty and a

Frosh To Have
Cheer Block a

Freshman Council is or-
ganizing a cheering block for
the Pitt-Ohio State game.

There will be a special

cheering section in the sta-
dium marked off for fresh-
men, and Frosh Council is hopeful
that all freshmen men attending
the contest will sit in the special
block. _ '

Postponement of election of of-
ﬁcers was another development
which came out of last Thursday
meeting of the Council. A

President Bob McGuire stated
that the postponement was due to
the fact that many orientation
classes have not selected represen-
tatives to the Council.

In view of the fact that all rep-
resentatives have not been elected,
and the representatives do not
know each other well enough to

select their oﬁicers, it was decided '
that last year’s oiﬁcers would con-
tinue to servein their present ca-.

pacity until- this year’s Council
elects its own leaders.

and returned the year after he graduated‘ to direct

the dance routines. _ _
 The Cap and Gown shows shad color,: they had
wit, and they had, off and on,Aso'me pretty good mu.-

They were a terriﬁc amount of work for the stu-
dents who did the writing and directing, the staging

and music-arranging. But nobody complains about S.
working hard; when they’ve got their heart in the _

thing they’re' doing. 

Cap and Gown, as the old ﬁles of the Pitt News
show, was something that the men on campus were
proud to call their own, ’ - _ _

in its prime tryouts brought out as many as 150

men for’30 parts,'but if the competition was rough,

and destructive have_ come through the mails this

‘ week. 9 «

It the State University of Iowa, faculty‘ mem-
bers‘are in the process ofbeing rated by members

‘ ._ of their classes. _ ‘ 9 9 P
'On_ the» destructive side, the practice of hazing -

ports the rating plan at Iowa

time on that campus. Instructors
are rated by students on the basis
of their teaching methods, knowl-
edge of subject, classroom per-
sonality, helpfulness, interestin 
subject," and testing proceedure. .

These pointsare graded on a comparative scale,
with the. consent of the instructor.’ Results are given

 

to'_ the .instructor‘s‘ only, who then ‘receive the re-

sponsibility for improvement.

The Technique
Two freshman of the‘Georgia Institute of Tech-

nology were convicted recently by the_“Ra‘t” Court, _
composed of upperclass ‘members of the Ramblin '

In the. October issue of the Panther, "Phi Epsil‘on

_- Pi president Cyril Wecht and Independent’ leader
Ross Reese traded verbal blows over theimerits of .
.- their ‘respective organizations. * .  

\Ross argues that _he’s having “too much fun as
an independent” to join a fraternity. His other ac‘-,

tivities, he insists, give him more “wholesome en-
joyment,” more friends, and at a considerable sav-
ing in time and money. _

Cyril has other ideas. He called the Independ-
ents “lost souls” who are giving up forever their

chance “to have St. Peter greet them at the Pearly‘

Gates.”

Both Cy and Ross enumerated an impressive list

of reasons favoring their own groups. Neither
struck" at the basic failure of University social
groups to date. _

No" one can predict how the rejuvenated Inde-

pendent Association will turn out, but the fraternity 9
.system at the Cathedral certainly hasn’t added much

to the brotherhood of man. , i ‘

in years ‘past. frequently provided scripting and mu- _

“tomers, discouraged the group. They decided to let

, different racial stocks and creeds.-

Gowners came back in December of 1947 ,9 with
“Mable’s. Fable,” with the traditional hairy-legged
heroine and" “chorus girls,” plus music, dancing and .
lyrics by students, aided by members of the gradu-
ate -Cap _and'Gown club. ' J .
The graduate Cap and Gown club still had, - A -5
nucleus here at Pitt in clean of men T. W. Biddle, -. ‘
‘William S. Saalbach, and Charles I-Iergenroeder,
business law lecturer. This graduate group, which

 

sical talent for free, managed both the ’46 and ’47
_shows~as their traditional function. '

(Two of the chief contributors to former
shows were ‘G. Norman Reis and Louis M.
Fuchan, who are also co-authors of the ~Pitt
Victory Song, probably once a curtain ﬁnale in
a Cap and Gown show.) 9 3 

The 1947 show ran into student apathy when '
casting time rolled around, however. _ '

This and a 10-day run (probably too long) in
Foster Memorial, which didn’t attract enough cus-

 

the organization fade quietly from. the Pitt scene.

“They just gave it up,”- says Mr. Saalbach, “not
permanently," necessarily, but because they thought";
it should be'put on at"the Nixon, but they didn't
have enough money.” 

So Cap and..Gown is dead as far as students at
Pittnow are concerned. But could it be revived?

esting story of some of the great shows-Cap an
Gown put on in its prime.) '

In the meantime, powerful Ohio State University, decked

fashioned by CoachAWoody Hayes
-—brilliant scarlet uniforms, and
its sensational ‘All-American half-
back Vic Janowicz, comes to the
Stadium Saturday to feast on the
victory—starved Panthers.

Field Goal Wins Game

Janowicz,_last year’s outstand-
ing college performer,
additional friendly slaps on his
broad 5'9", 196-pound frame after
last Saturday’s game with North-
western. It was Vic’s 18-yard

quarter that decided the import-
ant Midwest Conference game by
a 3';()- score. -’ . - .
J anowicz sparked the Buckeyes’
last year romp over the Pitts, 41-7,
by pitching four touchdown

er brilliant performances Jano-
wicz was named to'every leading
All-American team, thereby win-
ning the title of “everybody’s‘ all-
American.” ‘

this season after his platoons lost

another TD on a 5-yard jaunt by
Bobby Ingram of St. Mary’s, West
Va. _' '

from their initial win.

The victory for Rice was the
199th in the 40-year history of
the school. But the Owls caught
Pitt on one of its best looking
"days of the fall and made the
Texan three touchdown odds
appear to be. just another way
for the Big State-Little Empire
to brag.

As a unit the Panthers ‘played

the best, game of the season against 
the Owls. And with but four min— 

utesof playing time it appeared
that Pitt was well on their way;
to a 13-7 verdict. 

Rice No Setup ‘ 
The ‘boys had done all that wasf
expected of them. The Owls had-5

Panthers, and for a ball club that

SMU, 28-7, it looked like an upset E

career. Bobby Best_wick’s pass-.
ing was above average and Chris
'Warriner’s catching had netted
- Pitt 75 yards. =
And in addition the Pitts had
uncovered a halfback in freshman

ous job of spelling the injured Bil-
1y Reynolds. ~

six Rice fumbles. Everything was
pointed toward a" Panther upset
until the Owls collaborated for 65
yards on ﬁve plays to knot the
score, 13-13. Ten seconds later
end Bill Wright clalmly tacked -‘on
the extra point and the Pitts were
on their way to another defeat. '
