Week Chariot Race.

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

It was an unfortunate day
yesterday for Phi Gamma Del-
ta, Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sig-
ma, Kappa Kappa Gamma and
Sigma Delta Tau when, in the
middle of the Greek Week
chariot Race, their chariot
broke apart and flipped over.
They had no choice but to

watch as their opponent
dashed across the finish line to
win this year's race.

The winning chariot was
built by Delta Tau Delta, Zeta
Beta Tau, Delta Phi, Delta Zeta
and Alpha Delta Pi.

According to Jim Leib, a
Delta Tau Delta brother and
the rider in the winning chari-
ot, ’’It feels great. It was close,
but I had confidence that we

would win.”‘

”We crashed and burned,”
said David Wissinger, a Fiji
brother. ”We came in here ex-
pecting to win and ran into
some difficulties."

The brothers of Fiji and their
chariot team have been the
chariot race winners for the
past three years.

Even with the accident,
spirits were not dampened as

Deaf Awareness Day
kicks-off tomorrow

By Stephanie Gruich
Staff Writer

Karen Walkney, a deaf profes-
sor at Pitt who teaches sign lan-
guage, wants Pitt students and the
Oakland community to do one
thing tomorrow on Deaf Aware-
ness Day —— understand deaf peo-
ple for who they are.

Working mainly through Sign
Connection, the sign language
club at the University of Pitts-
burgh, Walkney has been helping
to spread deaf awareness
throughout the university and the
surrounding community.

Tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. in the William Pitt Union,
the Sign Connection will be
sponsoring Deaf Awareness Day.

Walkney, Pitt's first deaf under-
graduate andfirst deaf professor,

said that their goal is to promote
deaf awareness. ”We want to
show the hearing community that
deafness is not a handicap. We
can do anything that hearing peo-
ple can do," said Walkney.

Walkney, who has been work-
ing hard on the project, is very
excited about the whole day. She
said, ”Deaf Awareness Day is go-
ing to be one of the best this year.
Everyone is willing to help.”

She attributed this to the rela-
tionship she has with her students
and with Sign Connection
members.

”|t’s a family type of thing.
They accept my deafness and
don't pity me. I can be myself.
My students let me be me,” said
Walkney.

Council asks for
drug investigation

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh City Council an-
nounced yesterday that a sub-
committee has been estab-
lished to review the rules of
the Council and that the Cou-
cil will call for an investigation
of a drug problem on Trent
Street in the Hill District.

Sophie Masloff, City Coun-
cil president, said, "We ha-
ven’t done it [examine the
rules of the Council] for years.
As long as I have been here,
there has been a problem."

Masloff said at every meet-
ing a member of council seeks
an amendment to the rules.

The members of the sub-
committee are City Solicitor

Dan Pellegrini, Councilman
Marc Pollock, Councilman
Ben Woods and Masloff.
Masloff said she hopes to
have the recommendations of
the sub—commitee ready by
next fall.
City Council will also write
a letter to the Caliguiri ad-
ministration, calling for an in-
vestigation into drug problems
on Trent Street.
Councilwoman Michelle
Madoff reported hundreds of
hypodermic needles, balloons
filled with drugs and an excess
of garbage on Trent Street.

House
passes
abortion

bill

By Michael Blood

Associated Press Writer

HARRlSBURC (AP) - The
Senate approved legislation
yesterday that would restrict the
availability of abortions in Penn-
sylvania and sent the measure to
Gov. Robert P. Casey, who is ex-
pected to sign it.

Without debate, the chamber
passed the bill 33-14. Casey, who
has called abortion ”the ultimate
violence,” said last week he
would support the measure.

”This is a major accomplish-
ment for the Legislature," said
Sen. M. Joseph Rocks, R-
Philadelphia. ”Obviously, it's
been a long road for an extreme-
ly critical piece of legislation.’’

The bill, approved by the
House last week, represents a re-
vised version of legislation vetoed
by Casey last year. Casey, along
with leading anti-abortion foes in
the Legislature, drafted the new
bill that satisfied his constitutional
concerns during a series of meet-
ings earlier this year.

The bill would require women
younger than 18 to receive the in-
formed consent of at least one
parent, or a court order, before
obtaining an abortion. The bill
also requires victims of rape or in-
cest to report the crime before be-
coming eligible for public funds
for an abortion.

Criticism of the bill has largely
focused on provisions that would
limit the availability of public
funds for abortions.

Susan Frietsche, a spokeswom-
an for the American Civil Liber-
ties of Pennsylvania, labeled the
bill ”a civil liberties disaster.”

”This mandatory reporting pro-
vision does nothing but punish
the victim of a horrible crime.
The Legislature is leaving poor
rape victims with no choice other
than to self-abort or bear their
rapists’ babies," she said.

Senator Roy Afflerbach, a Le-
high County Democrat, labeled
the bill ”a snarling mongrel that
will snap at the heels of every
poor woman in Pennsylvania.”

Passage of the bill marked a
milestone for anti-abortion advo-
cates, some of whom criticized
Casey for his earlier veto.

"We are confident Governor
Casey will sign this important
legislation. The abortion control
legislation restores to parents the
right to protect their minor chil-

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 22, I988

Observers say corruption is widespread in Philly

PHILADELPHIA —— Corruption
is so widespread here that
crooked guards may be watching
crooks who may have been ar-
rested by crooked cops, defend-
ed by crooked lawyers or
sentenced by crooked judges,
longtime observers say.

”The only thing in the last 10
years that hasn't been crooked is
both the DA’s and the U.S. Attor-
ney's offices,” former District At-
torney Edward Rendell said.

Various investigations in the
nation's fifth-largest city, where
the Constitution was written 201
years ago, have resulted in con-
victions or charges against
judges, police, defense lawyers
and prison guards, the latest tar-
get of prosecutors.

The wave of corruption has hit
City Hall, too.

A federal jury last year convict-
ed Councilman Leland Beloff and
an aide of conspiring with reput-
ed area mob boss Nicodemo ”Lit-
tle Nicky” Scarfo to extort $1
million from a developer.

Last week, District Attorney

Ronald Castille announced that
the arrests of seven prison guards

and a cook in an escape and an
inmate's beating were part of
”Operation Ferret,” an investiga-
tion expected to yield more than
100 arrests among the city's ap-
proximately 1,400 prison guards.

Also last week, a federal judge
ordered former Common Pleas
Judge Kenneth Harris to begin
serving a 12-year sentence for ex-
torting bribes to fix cases. Harris,
67, is one of three former city
judges who have been convicted
and one of 16 who have been
named in various investigations.

The Pennsylvania Supreme
Court in February ordered eight
judges to be removed from the
bench, six permanently, as a
result of a federal investigation
into cash payments from Roofers
Union officials.

In Harris’ case, a lawyer-
turned-informant, Barry H.
Denker, testified he gave cash to
Harris and two other judges now
awaiting trial on extortion
charges.

U.S. says Russians
sending too many arms

WASHINGTON — The State
Department Monday complained
of large-scale Soviet arms ship-
ments to Nicaragua as the war in
the Central American country
cast a shadow over the visit of
Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze even before he
opened talks here.

Charles E. Redman, the depart-
ment spokesman, said the Soviets
shipped over 3,000 tons of equip-
ment to the Sandinista govern-
ment in January and February
alone.

For a number of years, the
Soviets have supplied Nicaragua
with $500 million to $600 mil-
lion in assistance annually, he
said. ’’I certainly don't see it as an
issue heating up,” Redman said.

In another development before
Shevardnadze opened talks with
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz late in the day, the White
House confirmed that there could
be two superpower summit meet-
ings this year.

Signing a treaty to sharply
reduce strategic nuclear weapons
this spring in Moscow ”is our
goal,” presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.

”We are hopeful, but there is
no guarantee that we'll have a
START agreement ready to sign at
the summit,” he said.

the 1984 Competition in Con-

The case stems from rejection
by the U.S. Army Corps of En-
gineers of a low bid submitted by
Ameron Inc., a New Jersey com-
pany, to repair sewer lines at the
United States Military Academy
at West Point, N.Y.

Although Ameron submitted a
bid of $1.03 million, some
$200,000 less than the next
lowest bidder, it was rejected by
the Corps because of a problem
with the bond supporting the bid.

Ameron protested the rejection

The law empowers the comp-

ly challenge the rejection of their
bids.

Awareness Day will receive a
pair of earplugs, which allow a
hearing person to experience the
difficulties of a hearing—impaired
person.

Throughout the day, there will
be many different groups enter-
taining the audience. Robin Page,
first vice president of Sign Con-
nection, said, ”There will be
three groups that will sign to mu-
sic.” Walkney is the director of
Beautiful Hands, one of the
groups that will be participating.

John Delong, a deaf musician,
will be performing. ”This [a deaf
musician] is very rare,” said Page.

The keynote speaker is Gary
Olsen, executive director of the
National Association of the Deaf.

Because of the conflict at Cal-
laudet University several weeks

ago, Walkney expects a good
turnout at the day's events.

Walkney said she supported
the uprising at Gallaudet. ’’I
loved it. I supported it all the
way.” She also commented that
because she doesn't understand
all of the hearing people's
problems, ”it isn't right for me to
be president of a university with
mainly hearing people.”

There will be a Sign Connec-
tion booth in the William Pitt Un-
ion tomorrow for interested
people to ask questions about be-
ing (leaf and Deaf Awareness

There will also be a carnival for
deaf children who will be attend-

Pitt evaluates effectiveness of new weight machines

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

A new type of muscle-
strengthening machine is being
evaluated by Pitt's School of
Health Related Professions.

Known as LAPKO, the weight
machines combine the versatili-
ty of free weights and the safety
features of mechanized devices

Artist gets

Associated Press Writer

SEOUL, South Korea —— Lee
Chul-soo draws stark pictures of
exhausted factory workers and
peasants clawing the earth with
their hands because he sees
beauty in their suffering.

”Beauty lies in the ordinary
lives and suffering of the com-

similar to the Nautilus system.

According to Ray Burdett, an
assistant professor in the School
of Health Related Professions and
director of the Movement Analy-
sis Laboratory, "LAPKO, in
theory, is superior to the Nauti-
lus system. It was built with safe-
ty in mind, in addition to
versatility.

"The idea is that a muscle

group varies as it flexes, so that
the strength of the muscle group
varies with its position," Burdett
added. ”LAPKO allows for specif-
ic muscle fibers to be selected for
improvement and the pattern of
resistance can be varied.”
LAPKO has been under de-
velopment for ten years by Paul
Lapcevic of Washington County.
Lapcevic received a $100,000

grant from the Ben Franklin Foun-
dation and Pitt to perform the

' research.

”There is one machine for each
circuit of excercising, such as
curling or leg exercising,” said
Burdett.

The School of Health Related

Professions and the Human Ener-
gy Lab of the School of Physical

Education has been testing the ef-
fectiveness of LAPKO since last
fall, performing a series of con-
trolled studies comparing it with
free weights, according to
Burdett.

Burdett is working on the
evaluation with Bob Robertson,
director of the Human Energy Lab
in Exercise Physiology.

his inspiration through others’ suffering

mon people,” the artist said with
a shy smile.

Lee is a leader of the growing
”Minjung,” or grassroots school
of art, that has evolved in South
Korea in recent years as a reac-
tion to decades of authoritarian
rule and the impact of industriali-
zation.

Minjung artists, who have at-
tracted a wide following among

young Korean artists, advocate
using art to fight for democratic
reform by depicting the hardships
of poor workers, peasants and
slum dwellers.

”Minjung art aims to expose
the social evils and injustices in
society. It also participates in the
movement of the masses,” said
Lee, a quiet, gentle man who
often smiles as he explains his

ideas.

The bold, realistic style of Min-
jung art and its bleak portrayal of
life are considered shocking in a
society in which artists generally
concentrate on landscapes or
happy rural scenes.

Minjung art is about the suffer-
ing of many Koreans who work
long hours for a very meager liv-
ing and spend their lives in

poverty, Lee said. It also is about
how industrialization has de-
stroyed traditional rural values
and made life bleak and pollut-
ed, he said.

Lee's bold woodcuts and por-
traits feature haggard men and
women drained by unrelenting
labor and bleak, hopeless lives.
A man claws at the stony earth of
his fields, a woman working at a
sewing machine in a factory
dreams of heaven, a beggar hud-
dles in front of a church.

Some critics have denounced
the new style as violent and
crude political propaganda that is
not art. ”Skepticism over the
quality of the works by Minjung
artists lingers on," said one critic.

Lee said his works are inspired
by the hope that a fair society
based on greater equality and
compassion can be built. He
dreams of a kinder, gentle world
and said showing how people
suffer can help bring change.

’’I’m not a radical," he said.
’’I’m an optimist."

Minjung art is also anti-
Western because its followers say
that Western influence has erod-
ed traditional Korean values and
brought industrialization and
other dehumanizing influences.

Some of Lee's works were re-
cently displayed at a Seoul
gallery. A steady flow of visitors
viewed the lines of stark wood-
cuts displayed on whitewashed
walls in the grimy, basement
gallery.

Lee admitted the show was a
sign of political liberalization and
of how artists are allowed free-
dom. The government of Presi-
dent Roh Tae-woo, which took
office in February, has promised
to end authoritarian rule and al-
low complete freedom of ex-
pression.

Lee makes a living as a book il-
lustrator and spends much of his
time working to develop Minjung
art. He said he wants to develop
the quality of the art and estab-
lish it alongside other artistic
schools.

A poor performance
in Central America

The Reagan administration has dropped everything to aid the
Honduran army: their support for the Arias peace plan, their
pretense of not wanting to get directly involved, even the 82nd
Airborne. The 82nd was the only thing literally dropped, in full
battle dress onto a peaceful airfield over 100 miles from the
fighting.

It is a necessary part of international politics that allies come
to each other in times of need. The question of need is a difficult
one to answer, and in answering it, our elected and appointed
officials are doing the job for which we pay them.

There is no reason, though, to turn the execution of foreign
policy into theater. And not even good theater at that. For a
day, the American public was treated to pictures and live cover-
age of hundreds of crack soldiers falling from the sky in the
shade of army-green canopies. Back in Washington, grim—faced
officials spoke of the sad state of affairs that had driven them
to these lengths. There were comments about the deterrent ef-
fect on the Nicaraguan troops.

Indeed, the Sandinistas have begun to pull back from the
border. Perhaps they had purchased tickets expecting a dra-

ma. They got only farce.

In a nutshell 

Why should we subsidize intellectual curiosity?

newspapers, the man on the
street was interviewed.
Philosophers postulated his
needs in their rationalization of
petty personal anxieties.

The man on the street is a hero.
He can at once be the drinking
buddy of a millworker and the
squash partner of the owner try-
ing to eliminate the millworker’s
job to increase his profit. The
street he inhabits is the back road
that shambles its way past the
house where I grew up, or the in-
terstate near which a certain lit-
tle pink house can be found.

When I saw him, the man on
the street was not in the best of
spirits. He was arguing with a
traffic cop who seemed to be in
the process of writing him a tick-
et. The nature of his offense was
unclear for the man had no car;
obviously, the man on the street
is a pedestrian.

”What do you mean I can't sit
here?" the man asked, waving his

hands. "This is my job; ask any-
body. Although I receive no
monetary compensation, I am un-
der the direction of no firm. Mini
skirts are on the way out. I have
spoken!’

The dismayed officer stepped
back, holding his worn plastic
notebook very still. The pen
standing motionless in his hand
was a cheap ballpoint. Blue.

”There are laws about vagran-
cy in this municipality,” the cop
said, the word tripping slowly
over his laboring tongue. He
seemed to be an intelligent man,
but eager to adopt an intellectu-
al colloquialism that wasn't his.
I expected there to be sarcasm
and menace in his voice; there
was only boredom.

’’I am not a vagrant. I am a ser-
vant of the people. I am their eyes
and ears, as well as their con-
science, although I have to be
careful how proud I get of that ac-
complishment,” the man on the
street said. ”Oliver North was a
patriot and a great scholar. He
should be sent to prison. I have
spoken/’

”Listen buddy,” the cop said,
visibly relieved and starting again
to write. The man clearly was a
lunatic. ”I’m going to cite you for

Who cares.

I got up this morning, but I
didn't have nothin’ to say. I got
up again this evening, and I went
to bed feeling the same way. I
wasn't anything but tired. I'm just
tired and bored with myself, so I
wrote this column, and boy, do
I need some help. Sounds like
something Bruce Springsteen
would say, doesn't it?

The Boss has come and gone
once again, taking with him the
hearts and money of screaming
fanatics who were willing to wait
in foul weather and sleep on con-
crete to obtain tickets to see the
man ”perform.”

Personally, I wouldn't pay IO
cents to see the man. And if I
were going to spend $300 (top-
price scalpers were getting this
for tickets), I'd expect Bruce
Springsteen to do a lot more than
sing me a few songs. For that

about

I'm probably one of the few
people in the United States who
doesn't like Bruce Springsteen. I
do have one of his albums —
Tunnel of Love. But the circum-
stances under which I came to ac-
quire it should tell you
something. A friend of mine
bought it, didn't like it and forced
it on me.

And my dislike for Bruce began
long before his marriage mel-
lowed him and his music.

It's not really that his music par-
ticularly bothers me. It's relative-
ly inoffensive. It's the kind of

music you could drink coffee and
clip your fingernails to. What
bothers me is that he's not worth
the price he's getting. When he
released that collection of
greatest hits a while ago, it was
one of the biggest, tackiest
money-making scams I'd seen
since anything Michael Jackson's
done.

And another thing —— if some-
one’s going to have so much
money, he or she should at least
have the decency to wear some-
thing other than a faded pair of
Levi's and a shirt with the sleeves
ripped off. Even Clarence has
more class than that.

vagrancy. If you wish to appeal,
you must appear ...”

The officer faded away into a
dusty haze of beaureaucratic
morality. The man watched with
impassive gray eyes and pulled a
crumpled pack of Kent cigarettes
from his pocket. He offered one
to the officer, who refused
without stopping his lecture. The
man put the cigarettes back into
his pocket. Kents are his favorite
brand (an independent survey
had confirmed it just that month),
but the man on the street had quit
on the advice of the surgeon

 

general. Someone in a movie,
though, had offered a policeman
a cigarette. It had seemed a po-
lite thing to do.

”Do you understand what I've
told you?” the officer asked, tear-
ing the ticket from its unspoiled
brothers and handing it to the
man.

”Sure, I guess so,” the man
said, looking away from the
officer to think. ”But you know,
I've got a wife and two kids, and
I have to make the payments just
like the next guy. The govern-
ment gets enough as it is. I have
spoken."

”I wouldn't know about any of
that,” the cop said. ”|’ve got a fa-
mily of my own, and if I want to
keep them alive, I've got to give
people tickets. It's my job. lfyou
want to, you can fight it in court.
Between you and me though, I'd
say the courts is gonna win. They
always win.”

Both men, seemingly astound-
ed to have found common
ground, were silent for a
moment.

”It’s a shame though, isn't it?”
the man said, ’’I mean, think
about it. You and I are standing
here, talking to each other, and
we might even get along. But be-

cause of the government, there
isn’t a whole lot of future in our
relationship. I might have to go
to court, and then you'd have to
testify.  It would just be a big
mess. Got to preserve the integri-
ty of the system and all. George
Bush isn't a wimp anymore. I
have spoken.”

The man on the street spoke
with a weariness he had adopted
because of a book he had read
about someone famous. It was a
good book. The famous person
was quite famous, and very rich.
The book had a lot of pictures to
prove it. He had been weary with
life. The man on the street
thought it was a good thing to be.
At least as good as any he had
heard of before. Someone in a
movie he had seen was weary.
The movie had made a lot of
money at the box office.

The police officer and the man
on the street parted company, the
police officer stopping to adjust
his nightstick so that it swung
properly when he walked. Ap-
pearances and all that. The man
on the street stopped to watch.

Smith criticizes coaching after early exit

(AP) —- Charles Smith, criticiz-
ing Pitt Coach Paul Evans for the
first time this season, said the
Panthers’ unexpectedly early exit
from the NCAA tournament was
a coaching fou|—up.

Smith and several other Pan-
thers pointed fingers not at them-
selves but at Evans after
Pittsburgh, despite holding a
three-point lead with four sec-
onds left in regulation, lost to
Vanderbilt 80-74 in overtime in

     

the NCAA Midwest regional
Sunday.

Pitt was seeded second in the
Midwest and was the only No. 1
or No. 2 seed eliminated in the
tournament's first two rounds.

Evans told a post-game press
conference that freshman guard
Darelle Porter was supposed to
foul Barry Goheen before he
threw in a desperation, last-
second three-pointer that sent the
game into overtime. Goheen had

given the Commodores a chance
to tie the game with another
three-pointer just five seconds
earlier.

But Smith, Sean Miller and De-
metreus Gore said that during a
confused huddle just after Go-
heen’s first three-pointer, nearly
every Pitt coach was talking at
once, and none of them specifi-
cally told Porter to foul.

”We were never told,” Miller
said.

”No one knew what to do, that
was the problem,” Smith said.
”No one knew. There's no way
we should have lost a game that
we were leading by three with
five seconds left.

”I’m not putting the blame on
anybody. It's a group. But any-
body who knows basketball
knows where the fault |ies.”

Evans said Porter was told to
foul Goheen ”but couldn't keep

  

up with him." Porter said he

lunior Pat Santoro became the first Panther wrestler in 25 years to win the NCAA championship.

 
   

didn’t know what to do because
of the tremendous confusion in
Pitt's huddle.

’’In the huddle, both of them
were being told, ’Fou|, don't
foul,’ ” Porter said. ”I don't know
what was said last. It was just a
miscommunication. I didn’t
know I was supposed to foul him.
I remember him saying it, but I
just missed the assignment. There

Santoro
reflects
on dream
victory

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The last time that Pitt has been
graced with a national champion
was in 1976 when the Tony Dor-
sett led Panthers made a run in
the football world.

All-American junior Pat San-
toro has put an end to the twelve
years of mediocrity.

Saturday night, Santoro put
away Edinboro's Sean O’Day,
16-11, to take the title.

”It really hasn't sunk in yet,”
Santoro said. ”It was one of my
goals in the beginning of the sea-
son, but l»real|y can't believe it."

Santoro had a seemingly easy
run to the title this year. Aside
from a 3-2 win over Carl Mono-
co in the semifinals, he handled
his opponents easily.

”Pat did a great job,” Pitt coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. ”He is
without a doubt the best 142
pounder in the country, and I'd
even say that he is in the top three
of all wrestlers. It was a
phenomenal win."

Santoro finishes the season at
48-0 and ranked No.1 in the 142
division by the Amateur
Wrestling News.

Some may say that beating one
person or team four times in one
season is impossible, but Santoro
did just that in beating O’Day.

lust how high can Heyward be drafted?

If foul, disappointing or upset-
ting incidents follow as a result
of this article, subsequent blame
will in turn be placed directly on
this paper's sports editor.

0 ’’I’m just hoping I go in the
first round,” former Pitt running
back Craig ”|ronhead” Heyward
told the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
last week, explaining his expec-
tations of the fast—approaching
NFL draft. ”People are talking
first round —— or even higher.”

Or even higher? Whoa. Isn't it
astonishing to think that Heyward
could find himself selected in an
upper atmosphere like the '/2th
round, or possibly even the
.2678943th round?

0 Speaking of the NFL draft, the

Atlanta Falcons have found them-
selves to be the lucky holder of
the very, very first pick. And a
selection of Heisman Trophy
winner Tim Brown would be a
big-time mistake for everything-
depleted Atlanta. Brown would
be a complementary addition to,
say, the New York Giants or the
Buffalo Bills, teams that are
young but fairly solid up front. At-
lanta needs defense and linemen
desperately before any top-o’-the-
draft wideout from Notre Dame.

0 The Washington Redskins
making former Chicago starter
Wilber Marshall the highest—paid
defender in the NFL is, quietly, a
slap in the face to Mike Single-
tary, the Bears’ best linebacker.

THOMAS
DANYLIIK

0 Rumor has it that I predicted
the Seton Hall Pirates would ad-
vance to the NCAA’s elite Final
Four. Unabashedly, the rumor is
true, and that choice strengthens
even further another rumor
which claims that I am the area's
most accurate false prophet avail-
able when it comes to NCAA
Tournament upsets. The Pirates
were tied late in the game against
Arizona, then Wildcat guard
Steve Kerr cooly hit an off-
balance, 29-point shot to bump
Seton Hall from thetournament,

84-55.

0 Seriously — how many of
you out there ever heard of
rainbow-artist Barry Goheen be-
fore he almost single—handedly
ejected Pitt from the NCAAs on
Sunday? (Probably the same
guess—who? gurus that have Rich-
mond, Rhode Island and Vander-
bilt still alive in their personal
tourney brackets.) All right, both
of you, step into this special room
we have prepared for wiseguys
like you.

0 In the tourney’s Midwest
Region - is the big mystery Will
Perdue, or ”Will Purdue ...?”

0 If Villanova somehow wins
the national championship this
year, like it miraculously did in

1985, then Don Johnson, Simon
LeBon and I will be vacationing
in the south-central Ukraine this
summer.

0 Isn't it pleasant to see
Georgetown get whipped every
so often? Temple blew out the
Hoyas on Sunday 74-53.

0 Over—hyped Kirk Gibson is
not going to lead the Los Angeles
Dodgers to the World Series. As
a matter of fact, Gibson never
even led the Detroit Tigers to
their title. Gibson did indeed con-
tribute to the Tigers’ 1984 World
Championship, but Darrell Evans,
Lou Whitaker, Alan Trammell
and Jack Morris were the guys
that got them there. Gibson was,

In their final home meet Friday
night, Pitt women gymnasts
defeated Bowling Green State
University.

Pitt won the meet with a
180.85 total; however, Bowling
Green kept the competition close
throughout the meet, finishing
with a 179.65.

The Panthers had some trouble
before the meet started. With an
unfortunate fall during warmups,
Shelly Sleith injured her head and
neck and was scratched from the
competition. Sleith has been Pitt's
top al|—arounder this season.

Coach Debbie Yohman felt that
the absence of Sleith hurt both
the team spirit and score. ”We
lost about two to three points
without Shelly,” said Yohman.
”The kids were down [without
Shelly], but we still managed to
do well.”

Pitt dominated the. vaulting
event with co—captains Kim Cal-
derone and Leann Vaughn plac-
ing first and second with a 9.45
(Calderone) and a 9.3 (Vaughn).
Junior Trish Aser tied for third
with a 9.2 (with BGSU’s Kim
Crawford).

On the unevens, freshmen

Borchers placed for Pitt. Vecchio
hit the bar routine of her career
with a score of 9.65. Vecchio has
been the top bar scorer for Pitt all
season.

Borchers hit ”the best bar rou-
tine she swung all year,” accord-
ing to Yohman. Borchers placed
third with a 9.1.

There were a few falls on
beam, but Vecchio managed to
finish second for the Panthers
with her highest score of the sea—
son, a 9.35.

On the last event, the floor ex-
ercise, Aser performed a beauti-
ful routine and achieved her
personal best score. She also won
the event with a 9.45. Freshman
Kathy Wallish followed Aser,
placing second with a 9.25.

Sophomore Hope Celani

reached her season goal on floor ~

with a 9.05.

This competition marked the fi-
nal home meet for seniors Calder-
one, Cathy Coleman and
Vaughn.

Cathy Coleman has steadily im-
proved throughout her four years
at Pitt. She scored career highs
this year on bars (9.45) and vault
(9.2). Coleman has earned three
letters.

Calderone has been the top
vaulter for Pitt all season with a

Chaney relies on stare Pitt

tactics for tight games

By Hal Bock

AP Sports Writer

HARTFORD, Conn. -- Silently
they stood across the court from
each other, the coach and the
referee, eyeball to eyeball for
what seemed an eternity, en-

. gaged in a major league battle of

nerves.

No words were spoken. No
moves were made. Temple coach
John Chaney and NCAA official
John Clougherty simply stared at
one another.

Perhaps glared would be a bet-
ter description.

Television had conveniently
called a first-half timeout in what
would develop into Temple's
74-53 second—round NCAA Tour-

nament blowout against George-
town on Sunday. While America
was being sold cars, tires, gaso-
line and beer, the confrontation
began.

Clougherty had no way to
know it, but he was in against a
professional starer. Chaney is so
experienced in his craft that he
has names for various versions.
For Sunday's showdown against
the referee who had just called a
technical on him, Chaney chose
”My One-Eyed Jacks Stare.”

Why the One-Eyed Jacks?

”lt fits officials real good,” the
coach said.

Chaney learned staring as a
boy. ’’I come from an old-
fashioned family,” he said. ”Any-

talking.”

”There was a lot of noise in the
huddle,” freshman guard Jason
Matthews said. ”A lot of coaches
were talking. Some of them were
saying foul, some of them
weren't. He didn't know whether
to foul or not.”

”He was never told to foul
him,” Core said.

Pitt assistant coaches Norm
Law and Mark Coleman said it
was mentioned in the huddle
about committing a foul, but they
weren't certain if the players ful-
ly understood their assignments.

Immediately after the timeout,
Vanderbilt fouled Smith, who
made both free throws to push
Pitt's lead to 69-66 with four sec-
onds left. Pitt had three timeouts
remaining but didn't call one,
thus allowing Goheen to dribble
down the sideline uncontested to
launch his tying shot.

’’I think each player in their
mind was thinking about it [foul-
ing], but as a group, you almost
have to be told by someone with
everyone there,” Miller said. "It's
not like human nature for you to
foul in that tight a game. It was
the only thing we had to do. It
was a lack of communication.”

Goheen said Vanderbilt lost
games to South Carolina and
Houston in the Sugar Bowl tour-
nament in New Orleans last year,
both on last-second three-
pointers.

”We said that if we were ever
in that situation again, we were
going to foul," he said. ”That’s
the way to attack that situation.”

Meanwhile, Pitt Junior forward
Jerome Lane, who has been en-
gaged in a running war of words
with Evans of late, said he is
”thinking hard about not coming
back” next season and turning
pro.

Continued from page 7

”Pat saw him as the single
thing standing in his way,” Stott-
lemyer said. ”He wasn't going to
let anybody stop him. He would
have beaten a guy nine times to
win the championship.”

While most champions raised
their hands in victory after win-
ning. Santoro wasn't into that.

After the final buzzer, he got
down on his knee and took his
ankle stripe off. He then walked
to the bench.

”Pat isn't the type of person
who celebrates that much, so he
just took it in stride,” teammate
Alan Utter said. ”After the finals,
we just sat around in the hotel
room, talked and watched
movies.

”I think he was more relieved
than anything else. It hasn't real-
ly sunk in yet. It'll be a couple of
days before it does.”

Santoro is the first Pitt wrestler
to win the national championship
since Jim Harrison in 1963.

”He is a true champion,” Stott-
lemyer said. ”He is a humble guy
who had one hell of a year. I
think he is somebody that you
can look up to.”

Although those watching the
match couldn't detect it, Santoro
injured his left shoulder during
the last period and had trouble
staying ahead.

”After the match he told me
that he had trouble when O’Day
went to the left,” Stottlemyer
said. ”Pat just figured he had a
big enough lead that he could
trade two points for one. After-
wards he was mad that he had to
do it. To him it wasn't a complete

match. But it was still great.”

’’I wish I could have wrestled
better in the last period,” Santoro
said. ”It was a bad way to end the
season.”

Even though the tournament
took place in Iowa, there were a
lot of people behind Santoro.

”The audience liked the way
that he wrestled,” Stottlemyer
said. ”There were a lot of oohs
and aahs coming from the fans.”

’’l was a little nervous going
into the match,” Santoro said.
”Every match is tough and I knew
that this would be no different. I
just used the same strategy that I
have used all year and was for-
tunate to win.

’’I really didn't know that I had
it until the last 10 or 20 seconds.
Anything can happen before
that.”

Stottlemyer differs with Santoro
on this point.

”To tell you the truth,” Stott-
lemyer said, ”after Pat got the first
takedown, I knew that he had it.
He just wasn't going to lose.”

Utter, Jeff Turner and Scott
Hovan also competed in the
NCAAs. Utter and Turner each
pulled out one match.

’’I think Jeff did a really excep-
tional job,” Stottlemyer said. ”He
and Alan wrestled good. Scott, on
the other hand, was a little differ-
ent. It wasn't his best week. I
think he was glad to get the sea-
son over with.”

PANTHER MAT NOTES: Ari-
zona State won the team title. Pitt
finished 15th. It was the second
year in a row that Pitt has finished
in the top 15.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 22, 1988

Chaney

Continued from page 9

time Mom and Pop had compa-
ny, you were not supposed to
talk. If you did, Mom just stared
at you and you went to your
room. You knew you were going
to get it.”

Unhappy with Clougherty’s
work in the first 15 minutes of the
Georgetown game, the coach fell
back on Momma Chaney’s stare
solution. What better time to ap-
ply it than immediately after a
technical? Georgetown’s Charles
Smith dropped in the two free
throws and, when CBS called
timeout, Chaney launched the
One-Eyed Jacks.

For one minute, 45 seconds,
the full TV timeout, the coach
stood with his back to his team,
which was huddled around his
assistants. His hands were on his
hips. He was slouching a bit. And
he was eyeballing Clougherty,

who was stationed across the
coun.

”Yeah, I saw the stare,"
Georgetown coach John Thomp-
son said. ”I started staring, too. I
was hoping his assistants weren't
talking to the kids.”

But Chaney knew they were.
”They know what to do,” he
said. ”They’ve been doing it
since Oct. I5. They'd do the
same thing if I had to go to the
hospital for an emergency
operation.”

To his credit, Clougherty
wasn't blinking. He stood with
the ball under his arm and sim-
ply stared right back at Chaney.
This was a basketball High Noon.
The Glaredown at the Civic
Center Corral would have made
Wyatt Earp proud.

Chaney felt safe with the stare.
"With the new rule, you can't
talk to the officials,” he said.

”He’d like to call another techni-
cal on me in that situation, but he
can't. What could he call? ’I see
what you're thinking?’ ”

The tension ended only when
the buzzer sounded to resume
the game, sending Chaney and
Clougherty back to work.

Later, when Temple had held
off a Georgetown rally and the
victory was secure, Chaney got
on the officials again, demanding‘.
that Thompson get a technical. ’’I
thought John called him the same
names I called him earlier,” he
said.

There was no call and Temple,
in control all the way, didn't need
one. That may have been why
Chaney never felt obliged to call
on the ”Reck|ess Eyeball,” a
heavy—duty stare used for more
serious indiscretions.

”That one used to get you ar-
rested down South,” the coach
said.

Pirates most economical team

By Ron Blum 7‘

Associated Press Writer

NEVV Y()RK  Buy the Pirates;

“) sell the Braves.

Baseball teams haven't gone
public, but lorbes Maga/ine is
pretending they have. And ac-
cording to Forbes, the Pittsburgh
Pirates are the most economical-
ly run team in the major leagues,
and the Atlanta Braves are the
least economically run club.

Using the payroll figures com-
piled by the owners’ Player Re-
lations Committee and revealed
by The Associated Press last fall,
Forbes says in its April 4 issue that
the Pirates paid the least per vic-
tory of any club in baseball in
1987. The Braves paid the most.

In its ”Up & Comer" column,
Forf)e.s shows that the Pirates,
80-82 last season and tied for

ilfourth in the National league

East, spent an average of
$50, 3()().25 per victory.

Second was the Seattle
Mariners at $70,506.41. The
Mariners were 78-84, fourth in
the American League West. Third
were the Milwaukee Brewers at
$83,711.25. They were 91-71,
third in the AL East.

The World Series champion
Minnesota Twins were 13th at
$137,317.13, despite a payroll
rise of nearly $3.5 million. The
NL champion St. Louis Cardinals
were 10th at $122,263.16.

The least economical club was
the Braves, who not only were
fifth in the National League West
at 69-92, but spent $195,585.41
per victory. Baltimore, 67-95,
was 25th at $192,738.30, and the
New York Yankees, 89-73, were
24th at $191,710.27.

Pittsburgh spent almost as
much money last season on play-
ers it had released as it did on
players on its roster. The Pirates’
payroll was $4,024,500. It spent
$3,545,000 on players such as
Steve Kemp, Jason Thompson,
Sixto Lezcano and Johnnie

leMaster.

Ranking clubs by runs, the
Pirates were first at $5,580, fol-
lowed by Seattle and Texas. The
Yankees were last at $21 ,653, 14
percent more than the Los An-
geles Dodgers, who were 25th at
$19,057.

Forbes also ranked teams by
average cost per fan —~ payroll
divided by attendance. Texas was
first at $3.60 per fan. Next were
the Cardinals at $3.78, boosted
by a record attendance of
3,072,122, the most ever by any
club other than the Dodgers.

Atlanta also was last in this

category, spending $11.09 per
fan on attendance of 1,217,402
and a $14,385,393 payroll, se-
cond in baseball to the Yankees.

The Braves’ cost per fan was 50

percent higher than any other
team. The Cleveland Indians
were 25th at $7.38 with a payroll
of $7,955,250 and attendance of
1,077,250, the lowest in the
major leagues.

Using these analyses, the
Pirates, Toronto Blue Jays and
Oakland Athletics are recom-
mended as buys. Milwaukee and
the San Diego Padres are specula-
tive buys, Seattle a buy for penny-
stock lovers and the Baltimore
Orioles a speculative buy be-
cause they can't go down any
farther.

The Chicago White Sox are a
sleeper to buy if they open

strongly.
Sells are Cincinnati, Atlanta,
Detroit, Boston, Minnesota,

California and Texas.

Rivas unsung tourney
hero for No.1 Temple

By Chris Dahl

AP Sports Writer

HARTFORD, CT -- There's no
getting around center ramon Ri-
vas’ value to No. 1 Temple.

Rivas doesn't have the running,
jumping and shooting skills of the
Owls’ better known players like
freshman sensation Mark Macon,
all-around athlete Tim Perry or
team quarterback Howard Evans.
A lot of people laugh when they
get their first glimpse of the
6-foot-1(), 25()—pouncler during
warmups.

But if Temple is to get past up-
start Richmond in the NCAA East
Regional semifinals Thursday
night at East Rutherford, N.J., and
continue its quest to be No. 1 at
the end of the season, then the
senior from Carolina, Puerto
Rico, must play like he played
Sunday.

”Ramon has taken a lot of criti-
cism over the years about not be-
ing able to score or run up and
down the floor," Coach john
Chaney said after the Owls beat
(}eorgetown 7-1-33 Sunclav.

"But he's been our anchor
since he's been here. He knows
our /ones and our shifts, pushes

our wings, and helps bring the
ball up. lie stays in there, and
with his size, he makes fast guys
slow trying to get around him.”

In Chaney’s structured scheme,
Rivas is the ultimate role player,
staying within the limitations of
his natural ability but contribut-
ing in many aspects of the game.

Rivas grabbed a game-high 12
rebounds and pounced on sever-
al loose balls in the win over (le-
orgetown.

A couple of times, (}eorgetown
players made the mistake of back-
ing away when Rivas got the ball
on offense, challenging him to
shoot. He made all three of his
field goal attempts -- two tur-
naround jumpers and a spinning
left-handecl shot underneath -
and seven of eight free throws for
13 points.

Rivas is nearing the end of his
college career after three years
under Chaney, and while his
body hasn't changed much, he
has become bigger in other
aspects of life as well as
basketball.

’’I grew as a person at Temple,"
Rivas said. ’’I know I'm a man
now. I was a kid when I came
here. 1 know I can go out and be
successful in life."
