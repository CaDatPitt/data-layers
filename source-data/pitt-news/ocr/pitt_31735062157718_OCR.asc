Also known as the “rose” team,
the event is under the sponsorship
of the social committee ‘of WSKA.
Each candidate for the title of
queen. will be presented with a
rose if her nomination ‘is declared.

Elections to select the queen
are planned for Friday. The polls
will function all day, and all
seniorwomen are encouraged to

reports.

Woman with the highest num-
ber of votes will be named Sen-
ior Queen on Tap Day. Runner-
up will hold the position of Alma
"Mater, and will ‘be made known at
the same time.

So far as procedure to nominate
is concerned, Senior Court ex-
plains that the suggestion box

cause it was thought to be a tool
for politics. ' ‘

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
makes his ﬁrst appearance before
a student group at next week’s
Monday Lunch.

On accepting the invitation to
speak Captain Hamilton said, “I

all of us——Pitt athletics.”

The new athletic director was
recently retired by the Navy after
long service. During the war he

was director of the Navy’s av1a- -

tion and physical ﬁtness program

Mr. Hamilton also served as ex-

Dick Campbell and Marion Ford
have obtained the use of the fourth

and Sailors Memorial hall to serve
as many students as possible at
this dinner on Monday, Feb. 28, at
12:30 p. m. However, only 200
can be accommodated. Reserva-

Tickets are 60 cents.

The Woman’s Choral Group trio
featuring Mary Krepps, Hope Ru-
ma, and Beverly Schmidt, will also
entertain. These singers were
well received at the January

Since_the success of the election

The nominating committee was};-,v‘i

The nominating committee ‘met
last Wednesday to consider all;

Ice Guesser   
Wins Tickets 

Marie Homisak declared today‘,
that an ice ball is not a round 
mass of solidiﬁed moisture. _ 

She explained; “Ice Ball on the... 
Pitt campus means the annual» 
Freshman spring dance.” ' . 

The dance, she said, will be held’ 11*:
Friday in the main ballroom of 
the William Penn beginningat 9 7‘-"‘.—;;
p. m. . ‘V 

She said the committee tagged _‘i
the dance as “Ice Ball” because‘ 
the decorations will center around
a huge artiﬁcial, “so-called” ice 2 11;
ball which will be suspended fromv
the balcony of the ballroom.

Students -and their dates will,
enter through an igloo and dance
to the music of Wes Parker ‘and
his band.

Tickets for the affair go for 
$3.25 per couple at the Student .-
Desk and $3.50 at the door. The
frolic will be informal and open
to all students,‘Mary said. , ‘

Meanwhile students on the cam-
pus were racking their brains to _ '
guess the number of ice balls in‘
the ﬁsh bowl. Two free‘ tickets “
will repay the lucky winner for
his mental strain, Bill Moltz said.

The bowls have been placed at
the Student Desk and in Ellsworth ,
Center. Everyone is urged by " V’
committee to take a crack at the '
bowl.

.   , SLANTED POOL
b'We’re' all of us a bunch of boneheads—and if you don’t
‘believe it just read the Post—Gazette.

The P-G, a well-known journalistic seeker after truth, came
to that conclusion after looking over the results of a poll taken
by the Jefferson Club.

‘The poll showed that in the ﬁeld of contemporary world
affairs Pitt students are about on a par with a well-informed
African bushman. To pu't it plainly we were sporting a ﬂashy
“D” when the Jeffersonians ﬁnished.

VVe’re little hurt. Not at the Jeifersonians, mind you, even
though their polling may leave something to be desired. \Vhat
we can’t understand is why the P—G thought that the poll, ob-
viously taken by amateurs, was worth space of the front page,
and why it should misquote the Pitt oﬁicial from whom they
received a comment on’ the stump.

Perhaps this is only a prelude to an even greater expose.
Who knowsbut what we may wake up some morning and ﬁnd
that some enterprising Post reporter is doing a series: I Was a
Moron at Pitt for Thirty Days.

We can remember the time (early in November, we believe)
when the P-G: hit the sawdust trail as far as polls were con-
cerned. At that time they dropped one Elmo Roper, a profes-
. sional poll-taker, for having made some slight miscalculation

with regard to an election. This, -in effect, is what the P-G said
tlienl

“We no longer believe in polls, and we don’t think
our readers do either.” .
Need we say more-.

For the reader who is not fully
aware of the facts of life, seeing
Walter White’s, first hand account
of racial prejudice is a jolting ex-
perience.

As secretary of the National As-
sociation for the Advancement .of
‘Colored People for more than
thirty years, White is well quali-
ﬁed to tell the story of his and the
association’s ﬁght -to save the Ne-
.gro ._from ‘oppression, and acts of
perversion. by the white race.

Blond-haired, blue-eyed,

conﬁdently and with ease as a

cause of the small fraction of Ne-
gro blood in his veins, he has cho-
‘sen to live as a Negro-, and to de-
vote his life to the ﬁght for
equality. ’

‘ Written from this objective
point of view, the book reports the

Negro as well asithe reverse with
a. perspective that makes the ra-
_cial line purely arbitrary. “Sup-
pose,” he writes,
‘every Negro ‘in America were sud-
denly to turn white. What would
happen to all the .-notions about
‘Negroes, the bases on which are
‘built race prejudice and race ha-
‘t'red?”

Music Notes

BIERMAN

RCA Victor’s recent 45 rpm record policy has really put a Qdeirit
in my fender. Eight months ago LP was introduced to the American
public on a 33% rpm nonbreakable disc. By all rights other record
companies should have standardized this long awaited development

in the record industry: being .able¢
to hear it played without interrup-
tion. Instead of sticking together
the industry has broken into two
different factions. Capitol has
followed in the footsteps of RCA’s

the World Student Christian Fed-

ed simple, but behind it all he
opened up a world of thought.

Not until Mr. Watts talked in-
formally with students at the tea
in Stephen Foster Memorial that
same afternoon did he give the
‘background for his thinking.

The Reverend Watts is slight of
build, about 5’ 7” in height, and
looks at the person to whom he is
‘speaking with an expression that
makes one believe what- he is say-
ing. He was educated at ‘King’s
College, Canterbury,’ and came to
the United States in 1938, at which
time he entered the Episcopal
seminary at Evanston, Illinois. _

Dr. McG,rathAddresses Meet
Of‘University Committees
Pitt had a distinguished visitor Friday in the person of Dr. Earl

J, McGrath, who was recently nominated by President Truman to
be United States Commissioner of Education.

4 Dr. McGrath, a professor of ed-e
- ucation at the University of Chi-.

cago, was here to address a joint
meeting of various committees of
the University on the topic “Gen-
eral Education Today.”

General education, Dr. Mc-
Grath deﬁned as “the. education.
that prepares us for the com-
mon activities as distin-guished
from education that specializes.”

“General education,” he said,
“seeks to reestablish the notion
that the intellectual and social de-
velopment of students is the chief.
end of education,_ to which pro-
fessional or specialized training,
important as they are should be:
secondary.”

Dr. McGrath also believes that
“Developments have now pro-
ceeded far enough ahead to justify
that the prediction that funda-
mental changes will take. place,
generally throughout the colleges
of the United States in the im-
mediate years’ ahead.”- '

From the pulpit Mr. Watts

pointed .out very vividly that

medicine, education, philosophy,
and religion only serve man so
that he may continue to exist. In
doing ‘this, the above do not give
an answer to the question, “Why
should man continue to exist?” To
date they have only said that man
exists, to exist. Religion itself has

the answer,” said Dr. Watts, “but ’

to exist ultimately we must unite

V . . . Is religion itself united?”

“Man exists to be in unity with

God,” said Mr. Watts. That unity‘

will come with ‘a return to a world
of theocentricity . . . where peo-

about God, the center.”

Rev Watts spoke dynamically, .

as he no doubt does when coun-
seling with students on his home

campus at Northwestern. His part- .
ing thought to students as he left V

the University tea was this: “The
ultimate new heaven and new
earth is to make everything a unit
with Christ.” -

A The University Catholic Club
presents _the Reverend Thomas
McGlynn, O. P., internationally
known sculptor of Providence Col-
lege, Rhode Island, tonight at 8:30
p. m. in Foster Hall auditorium.

The author—sculptor will speak
“The Story of‘ Fatima.” A

Art Institute. He is a student of
the noted Swedish-A rn e r i c a n
sculptor, Carl.Milles.

During the last decade, Father
McGlynn has produced many im-
portant works of sculpture, among
which are the celebrated statue of
Blessed Martin de Porres in Wash-
ington, D. C.

His most recent work is the
statue of Our Lady of ‘Fatima. In
order to achieve accuracy in the
representaion, the speaker went
to Portugal in February, 1938, and
there conferred with Lucy dos
Sentos, the only survivor of the

'-three children who saw our Lady

of Fatima in 1917.

Because of the instruction re-
ceived from this Dorthean Sister,
the statue of Our Lady of Fatima
is unusual in both origin and de-
sign.

municate in any manner with a
prospective member about fra-
ternity affairs throughout this

will then transmit to the fraterni-
ties either the acceptances of re-
fusals of the rushees at the con-
clusion of the silence period.

ALong Time
Between Stars

By DONALD GIFFIN
Sports Editor

Records, statisticians’ livelihoods, are made to be broken. Many,
undergo constant change, others stand for years, set by some great!
star and gather dust until another brilliant athlete comes along to
eclipse it.

Pharmacy Five

That’s what happened last Wednesday, when Sammy David put
a new mark into Pitt’s ledger of records.“ The dead-panned senior.‘
did his best to grace the occasion with an upset of the invading West 
(By Gawd) Virginians, but his ’ """""" "  !
efforts fell three points short.

David undoubtedly would sooner
have beaten the Mountaineers
than cracked the season scoring
ﬁgure of Charley (Chipper) Hyatt,
which had stood for 19 years. He’s
that kind of a guy.

The breaking of a standard
naturally invites a comparison be-
tween the newcomer and the old-
time king. ' .

Nobody ranks David over Hyatt,
and we wouldn’t dispute that. We
weren’t around, when Chipper

But we .don’t hesitate to say it’s

"Quiet, Sam at least rates a high‘
spot. on. the list of Panther ﬂoor
stars ‘ for overturning a mark of

games, 16 of which were played on"
unfamiliar, foreign courts.

'He’s moving toward -400 points
with .a club -’chat’s lost four more
than it’s won.

That’s how Doc Carlson looks at ’
it, as he calls Sammy “wonderful.”
“Hyatt had a much better cast
behind him. (‘The ’29-’30 Panthers

/nrenrts /couldn"t throw up a tight. ,
defense. then, as they do agai-ns.t
,us now. We had a more .aoc.ura-te '
team that could shoot from the
outside and recover the re-
_bounds.”’

’ “"O.ur_system gives all the, play-
.er»s. an equal -opportunity to scoreﬂ
but Sammy takes tlhefbest advan-vi
tagesl of this,’-’ Doc said. “He uses

The Pharmacy practically assur-
red itself of playoff berth in the
Coast League by beating the Pio-
neers, 38-31, Thursday at Trees

gym.
It was the ﬁrst loss of the sea-

the ﬁfth straight win for the
Pharmacy since they lost their
opening game to the unbeaten
Indians. .

Never behind, the Pharmacy
led, 21-16, at half-time. But the
Pioneers rallied in the third quar-
ter and pulled within two points
of the winners.

Big Harold Cathcart with two
quick baskets took the Pharmacy
out of -danger.

In another game at Trees gym,
the 'Colle_gzians~ walloped the

winners led 24-15 ‘at half—time,

Double Roll Call

The title of this one could be
“What's in a name?” or “It
couldn’t happen to a Rosen-
berger!”

It seems’ that‘ all was going
well with the roll call of the
Wednesday evening-class in 127
CL until the instructor read out
the name “Rosenberger.” Two

people answered- for that one.
Maybe that’s alright‘ once in a_
while with a Smith or at Jones,

but Rosenberger, uh-uh. But’

‘what happens next shouldn’t
happen to a Rosenberger! One
Rosenberger turned to stare at
the other Rosenberger and, two
brothers were staring at each
other. How did they know that
they were going to be in the
same class? Richard didn’t even
know that his brother, Forrest,
had started school this semester.
