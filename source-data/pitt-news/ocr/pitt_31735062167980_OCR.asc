Public Assistance Groups

Share University Crisis

by non GING \ \

Staff Writer I
Although there is great con-
cern over the destiny of the
University in lieu of the .finan-

cial crisis, one aspect of the ’

crisis which is often ignored
but is equally important is
what will happen to the other
public assistance groups who
are as yet unfunded?

As a meeting Sunday night,
the Emergency Committee for
Pennsylvania was formed.
This group is concerned with

-the financial plight of unfund-

ed public institutions such as
the state mental hospitals, pub-
lic schools, housing and welf-
fare programs, poverty pro-
grams, and also, the Universi-
ty. Members of the committee
come from groups represent-
ing public schools, welfare and
housing programs, women’s
voting groups, public services,
the University students, fac-

-ulty and administrators and

political organizations.

The Emergency Committee for I
/Pennsylvania(ECP)

resolved
various issues at this organiza-
tional meeting and is attempting
to set up programs to put pres-
sureon the state legislature to
pass the full appropriation needed
to keep various public assistance
programs and institutions open.
One of the aims of the ECP is to
research and distribute pamph-
lets and information on the vari-
ous tax bills that have been pro-
posed, the results that a failure of
fund appropriations will have on

the community and different ways
to pressure the legislature into ac-
tion.

Another topic discussed was the
march on Harrisburg scheduled
for March 9 and how the commun-
ity can be mobilized to participate
in this march. Efforts are also be-
ing made to set up a state-wide
meeting of powerful interest
groups who are concerned with
public assistance, which may pos-
sibly 'be coordinated with the
march. .

In talking with a spokesman
from the ECP. it was pointed out
that the legislature will probably
not fund the University unless all
other non preferred budgetary
items are also funded 100 per cent.
The ECP is hoping that it can work
with the University and that both
groups will work for mutual full
funding. Some of the programs
which are now unfunded and which
the group is attempting to attain
funds for are: housing assistance
(three mil-
lion), redevelopment assistance
(30 million )2 supplemental pover-
ty aid (44 million); non-public
school aid /(23 million) employ-
ment assistant (three million):
housing agency and community

action (three million); day care.

centers (two million» and West-
ern Psychiatric Institute (two and

. one-half million ).

The»ECP intends to undertake
the task of bringing the serious-
ness of the le'g_is‘lative impasse in
the state capital home to the com-
munity and work through all avail-
able means to bring about better

state» government and eliminate.

problems like this in the future.

  Legislator Responds

by GERALD KAUFMAN
_ State Legislator

(Editor's Note! The following is a
letter which Representative Gerald
Kaufman, Squirrel Hill Democrat, is
sending in reply to the many Pitt

students, faculty and alumni who.

have written him concerning the fi-
nancial crisis of the University. He
asked that we print it in the Pitt
News as an open letter to the Uni-
versity community. Also see page
four for another representative's
views on the University's financial
crisis.)

Thank you for your letter relat-
ing to the States budget and tax
problems. You will be interested
to know that I took my position in
favor of a state income tax as long
ago as during my last campaign
for the Legislature—-in the Fall of
1968—I stated publically. and in
debate with my opponent. that I
advocated a state income tax as
the only equitable solution to the

  Burglaries Routine

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer

Students of Physical Education
have been victims of a series of
burglaries which have become.
more or less, routine occurrences.

‘These thefts are most frequent in

the men's lockerroom at Trees"

Hall.

Dr. Karl C. H. Oermann. direc- .

tor of health, physical education,
recreation, and safety. attributes

 these burglaries to ‘carelessness

and neglect. "Often times stu-

dents simply forget to lock their ,

lockers. This is an open invitatio
for burglars to break in. ‘

‘‘However..''o Dr. Oermann ac-'

knowledged. "anytime there are
three or four thousand students.
problems are bound to arise."

The last theft reported, accord-
ing to Oermann, occurred a week
ago. But, he added, that he is “not
up-to-date entirely,” and “there

‘ is always another one going off”

that he is not aware of.

g Articles commonly stolen are .

tches. and ID ,

uables stolen. the security guard
is now making a special effort to
check students‘ IDs. Students are
now being askedito produce a sec-
ondary identification. ‘Many are
further requested to write their
signatures, so that the guard may
compare it with that on the’ ID. 
These measures helped to ar-
res_t a burglar two weeks ago. In
his’ possiession were found five
watches and a ‘stolen ID card.
“However.", Oermann asserted.
"for every one person‘ who is
caught..l5 others escape. If tres-
passers fail to produce sufficient’
identification. they runrout of the

building before they can be stop-i

ped."

In addition to this, according to
Oermann,’ other precautions are
being instituted. One of them is
having a gaurd stationed in the
men's locker room. This has been
virtually ineffective, though, in
reducing the rate of robberies,
since the security guard must stay
in the frontrof the building and

check identification cards. A
Still_vanothero is-3 the ipr7ovision__ in- K

        

lud d tb t

     

contract ‘requires that students:

make certain their lockers are
locked before they go into the gym.‘

Finally, the tunnel connecting
the Pitt Field House with Trees
Hall_has been sealed. so as to pre-
ventburglars from sneaking into

-the locker room. This method is

largely unpopular. since students
who normally use the tiinnel are
now exposed to the cold but, as Dr.
Oermann maintains, “It has
shown results."

/

A further solution presently be-
ing considered is having students
cbeck their valuables before going
into Abe locker room. Students,
upon checking their belongings
would sign their names on a'sbeet
of paper. When they leave, they

would again sign their names and

if the signatures matched, the

. items would be returned.‘

dilemma of meeting the ever-in-
creasing needs of the Common-
wealth.

A few weeks ago I again made a
public statement ‘concerning the
need for a state income tax. It

was carried in the press. on TV .

and radio. In spite of -all this pub-
licity. it is surprising and discon-
certing to find how many of those
who wrote to me areunaware of
myposition. In addition. I have
prepared an income tax bill which
I expect to introduce in the Legis-
lature in the next few weeks.
There is. however. little hope at
this timethat we can get suffi-
cient votes to pass "it. I will. there-
fore. vote for any reasonable tax
put before us in order to fund the
essential programs of the Com-
monwealth. I -

The conflicting pressures "to
fund“ and "not to fund" the bud-
get have resulted in a virtual par-
alysis of the Legislature. As you
know. we have passed $270 mil-

‘lion worth of additional taxes.

These resources. - inadequate to
fund the entire Commonwealth
program. are being fought over by
each interest group, including
those writing on behalf of the Uni-

- versity of Pittsburgh. In face of

the inter-relatedness of all the ed-

' ucation programs’ and the many
. social welfare programs—much
of which is directed at our young I

people—it is distressing to»wit-
ness the "everyman for himself”
attitude being displayed in the

‘fight-for funding.

The alternatives tofunding the

_entire Commonwealth program

remain unthinkable. I will, how-
ever. spell these out for you:

(1) The $270. million worth of
new taxes that we have passed
leaves $200 million deficit to be
funded. We could fund Pitt, Tem-

ple and Penn State. now, plus a few

other. programs, and hope that

sometime we would find sufficient
-additional taxes - to support the

otberprograms. These other pro-
grams include aid to non-public
schools, a special appropriation
to urban school districts, various
higher educational institutions,
state employee raises vital to the
operation of our institutions and
basic services, and a number of
welfare programs necessary to
the demandsof today’s.society.

ting the budget by $200 million._

V (2) The other alternative would
‘be to allocate the amount oftaxes
we have already passed pro rata
among all the unfunded appropria-
tion bills. This would leave the uni-
versities considerably short of ' f
the amount they need, and would /1.‘
result in a substantial tuition rise. , .

cited above. It will leave us with

Last Thursday. Feb. 19. in the
Pitt YMCA's suite of offices. Ron
Moslener. office manager and act-

his organizations goals and pro-
grams. According to Moslener.
"Education is the emphasis in this
society." Therefore. a majority
of the Yis programs concern edu-
cation on various levels.

Project Campus. involving over
200 junior andsenior high school
students from. the Oakland area
and 150 tutors from the Universi-
ty. is the largest and most suc-
cessful activity. With pride, Mo__s-.
‘lener ' interjected. “In Project
Campus. the need for education is

' provlen; it is our most productive
program." '

A more specialized program for
junior high participants interested

‘ in ‘one of the diverse fields of en-

gineering is Project ‘,,Engineer.
Many industriesnand members of
the engineering faculty are taking

an active irr__terest by planning field .

Goals

Not only are college courses
taught on the junior high level, but
the students have the opportunity
to meet with advisors ‘to discuss
classes and college life. The pur-
pose of, this program, Moselener
states, “Is to get a feel at the jun-

Vior high level of what it is like to

sit in a college classroom.”

Students are _not the sole reci-
pients of the YMCA's programs;
Moslener maintains that the Y
aims to service the community ‘
and its institutions. also. Groups
ofvolunteers are involved in week-
ly excursions to the area state
mental hospitals. Their activities
include a Coffee House. tutoring.

‘and -a variety of recreational
' sports. The Y has initiated Proj-
fect Prison. enacting similar pro-

grams but which is lying dormant _

because the committee needs ma-

ture. dependable volunteers.

Leadership. one of the Y‘s tra-
ditional goals, is embodied in
Project Judo-Pal. Those involved
learn judo t'rom a black-belt in-
structor and then teach their new-
ly-acquired skill to ghetto chil-

dren.

Because most of the YMCA’s—
programs concern human rela-
tionships and personal growth, all ,
student leaders and interested stu-
dents are urged to take part in
Project Discovery. Members re-

, ceive senstivity training from pro-

fessionals and Moslener contends,
“Develop interpersonal relation-
ships and make people aware of‘
who they are, where they’re going
and‘ how to_ relate to" other per-

V . sons_.’’‘

Movie Traces

by CINDY MORGAN
Staff Writer
The Southern Christian Leader-
ship Council and the National Co-
ordinating Committee will be
sponsoring a documentary film.
entitled King: A Filmed Record

. . . Montgomery to Memphis. The"

full length two and one—half hour
motion picture. which is to be
shown - on March 24 will trace
the life of Dr. Martin Luther King
from 1955 until his death in 1968.

The film will be attended by an
estimated one million persons in
more than 300 cities. In the Pitts-
burgh area. the _ film is to be
shown at the North Hills Theater.

the Stanley Theater downtown. the‘

Regent Square Theater and the
South Hills Village Theater.

A single showing is expected to
raise $5 million to help organiza-
tions dedicated to carrying on the
late Dr. Kings work and teach-
ings. Of even greater significance.
perhaps. is that this motion pic-
ture will document the civil rights

movement in the United States .

during its most important ‘period
ofrevolution. It is hoped that a
longer four-hour verision of the

_' film will be used as an education-
al tool in schools-and universi-
ties.

Ely Landau who is a motion pic-
ture’ producer. After Dr. King’s
assassinatio_n,- Landau approach-
ed Mrs. King and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference,
the organization through which

Dr. King worked, witllhis sugges- _
tion fora professional documen- ’

tary. For nearly two years he not
only worked without compensa-
tion, but a large cast of other ar-
tists, broadcasting entities‘, and
professional publicity firms also
volunteered their services.
March ’24, nearly. 1,000 fully-staff-
ed" theaters will be provided fo

the world premiere. . ’

In commenting on the overall-
project. Landau stated."'The uni-
que concept of a. single evening.
nationwide showing of the film

* will not only produce maximum

revenues to help carry on the life

work of the late Dr. King but will

also serve as‘ a dramatic‘ tribute
to Dr. »King‘s memory. We hope
that in somesmall way this event

. will be worth of. and do justice to.

'voted his life."

Mrs. Coretta Scott King said.
"We have not previously had an
opportunity to see at one time all
of the campaigns that were co-
ducted during those 121.2 years
of my husband's life and leader-
ship. With this motion picture.
many people who had very little
knowledge of the non-violent
movement will now be able to see
and understand it and its rele-
vance to problems today.“

Ticket sales began on Jan. 15,

6 Dr. King’s birthday. They will be

available at the local theaters

' showing the film and from sup- _
port.committees who will pur-

chase tickets themselves, and
then distribute them. Each ticket
will be sold for $5. and will be con-
sidered a tax-deductible contribu-

' by PAUL LeBLANC
Revolutionary Socialist Union
In 1964, Mario Savio, spokes-

man for the Berkeley Free Speech
discussed Clark

tion as a “knowledge industry.”

He suggested that the corpor-
ate elites which dominate both the
U.S. economy and the boards of

’ trustees of U.S. universities see

the faculty members as workers
and the students _as raw material
in an industry geared to produc-
ing well-conditioned personnel for
slots in the corporate political-'so-
cial-economic structure. Savio and
his comrades argued for an alter-

- native—a scholarly community in

which people could creatively de-
velop their minds and deepen their
understanding of reality.

Inlour high complex, technolog-
ically advanced, bureaucratized
society, the children of all strata
(especially the children of the low-
er income and working class ma-
jority) should—as a matter of

_ right—have access to institutions

A of higher learning.

IF THE intellectual tools and

" -Symposium Friday

 J Student-Worker Alliance Crucial, Implied

and dealing with the complexities
of our society become the posses-
sion of an elite minority. demo-
cracy becomes a total sham. And
becuase the university is a prod-
uct of the wealth created by labor
in society as a whole, the major-
ity sectors of the population have
a right to expect that they shall
have access to the universities
which they help maintain.

As we've seen, a second aspect‘
of Savio's analysis sees students
as “raw material“ to be turned
into cogs for the capitalist ma-
chine. Certain sociologists. eco-
nomists and others with a Marx-
ist bent have developed perspec-
tives which may provide a clear-
er understanding.

Due to the economy's'dramati-

cally changing technology. they
note, the composition of the labor

.force has begun to change. The

sector which we’ve usually thought
of as a rapidly growing new mid-
dle class (white collar workers.-
technicians, professionals) are
in fact "new working class" be-
cause. according to Marxist cate-
gories. they make their living not
by owning businesses but by sell-
ing their "labor power."

Congressman States

Opposition To Budget

. (Editor's Note: Sophomore History major Lois Fundis wrote a let-
ter to her Congressman, Democrat John F. Laudadio of the 56th Dis-
trict urging him to vote on the budget and release the delayed univer-

/  . , sities' appropriations. Laudadio wrote back on Feb. 10, making his posi-

tion clear. Miss Fundis read the letter to the l,000 plus students who
attended the financial crisis meeting in Common Facilities building last
Wednesday. The following is-a reproduction of the original.)

Dear Miss Fundis,

Thank you for yourrecent letter concerning University of Pitts- '

burgh financial problems.

I do appreciate your deep concern for the University's financial
problems and I, at this time, should set the records straight. I am
not voting to give the University of Pittsburgh $36,000,000, which
means taking additionalrdollars out of workingmen and women’s

’ paychecks in additional tax revenues.

I have made my position quite clear for a long time, that I will
not vote to take money from the little peoples’ pocketbooks; thus the
‘University had better learn to live under a new program without
looking to the State Capitolfor tax dollars.

As a matter of philosophy, the University had better start to
line within a budget that projects the kind of University that it is
rather than poor-mouth to the state taxpayers. Every‘ year this re-
quest for moneys (sic) increases far and beyond the taxpayers’ abil-
ity to pay, so my vote is not going to change their daily interest what-
ever, for I oppose this kind of give-away program.

If we accept this perspective.
we conclude that most students
not "raw material" so much as
workers-in-training. apprentice-
workers.

IF SAVIO’S analysis is accept-
ed with these two supplements.
we come to the realization that the
objective interests of students
and workers coincide. Needless to
say. there are complications.

Many working people have ac-
cepted the media stereotype of
students as an irresponsible and
obnoxious elite. Many students.
on the other hand. look down their

noses with an almost unforgive-

able snobbishness.and contempt at
those who labor.

Yet our recent financial crisis
has revealed other possibilities.
A dean of Liberal Arts has de-
clared that the cause of students
and the cause of university em-
ployees and hospital workers are
one and the same.

which cannot be polished off neat-
ly in a Pitt News column. This Fri-

Past Pres. Pro Tem, SG Senate

At last Student Government
(SG) election decision holds and
the new officers prepare to take
the oath of (office and get down to
some relevant work. Just a quick
look at the SG office proves that
their eagerness to get to work-

they cleaned it. But what I ques-

— I’  /ijw '-; I " _ .
SC Banquet U nnece

tion is their preparation for taking
the oath of office, an Inaugural
Banquet held by'and for the new
officers at the expense of SG.

More than 80 people received in-
vitations to dine onone of the most
expensive meals available at the
Faculty Club, compliments of the
SG. Although these lavish affairs
continued for many years, the
past administration and Alloca-
tions Committee decided this is a
waste of at least $340 and only

funded $30 for a "coffee and do-

nut" reception. But the new ad-
ministration refuses to accept
this change. Is this the typical
change attacked during the cam-
paign‘? ‘ ’
Twenty-seven students‘ taking
the oath of office is the only real
purpose for this banquet. Realiz-
ing this we must look for “other
reasons to rationalize this unne-
cessary expenses of time and
money for a ten minute cremony.
The only reason I can surmise is
that our new student leaders are
using SG money and therefore stu-
dent money to glorify themselves.
If they were truly student leaders

ssary r

,they would not permit such a mis-

use of‘ student funds, but would
suggest that the more than $300
go to meet the needs of students.

HOW» CAN Mr. Cundra state in
his letter .to new Senators, “You
will have an opportunity to create,
to innovate new ideas in activities
and policies; together we can
build this SG into a" trulyvaluable
organization, one which will seek
to meet the needs of students."
And, yet approve funding for a ban-
quet which does just the opposite?

Alternative uses, meeting the
needs of students, are easy to
think ‘of: the money could be'do—
nated "to Peace and Hunger Week,
for creative programing like send-
ing the senators to group dynam-
ics labs. to rent buses to the pos-

sible March 9 march on Harris-

burg. etc. With the University-in
the midst of its worst financial
crisis. with all departments cut-
ting their budgets, how can stu-
dent leaders spend student money
in glorifying themselves? I refuse

to. and publicly make my RSVP _

to my invitation to the SG Inaugur-
al Banquet NO!

RA Psychoanalysis?

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Staff Writer '

It was recently brought to the
attention of The Pitt News that
the process being used to inter-
view prospective resident assis-
tants (RA) was unfair.

Among this year‘s applicants.
the general consensus was that
the techniques employed were
those of an amature psychoana-
lyst. one unqualified to objectively
interpret the various i'eplies.

QUESTIONS SUCH as "Whatis
your favorite color?“ “What do
you see when you ‘close your
eyes?" and “What would you like
to be reincarnated as?"were ask-
ed.

This process caused u n d u e
alarm; In the past. the interviews
ran along the expected lines. Be-
cause of ‘the diversification this
year. student applicants felt an
intrusion of . privacy. ,

As in the past. next year‘s RA‘s '

which includes the staff of the
Housing Office and all of thejhead
residents. According to Mrs. Don-
na Smith. head of this committee,»
most questions were not viewed
for their answers. but instead. as
a device for getting the group in-
terviews moving. _

MRS. SMITH also stated that
students were encouraged to seek
out individual interviews. She con-
cluded that the people involved in
the selection process all had de-
grees in psychology.

.Miss Devra Kimble. head resi-
dent of Amost Hall, argued that
the answers were interpreted in a
creative way and not psychoanal-
ized. ‘

She stated- “All of us are in-
volved in counseling. . . . Each stu-
dent was giventhe opportunity to
return for a "personal interview
. . . if they felt that the process
was unfair." Miss Kimple ended
by saying that she has numerous
appointments this week.

Even if the-replies were analyzed.
the RA Selection Committee is
composed mainly of people who

’ are qiIali’fied to do so.

It,_is_ strange that at a ‘time

when’ the students at Pitt are,

clamoring for structural breaks
and. innovations in-.standard bu-
reaucratic processes. there would '

be objections when a new proce- '

dure was instituted.

' Many dorm students have ques-
tioned the entire concept of RA‘s,
feeling that the results of the Se-
lection Committee were always
hit andmiss. and that. therefore.
the University is equippedwith
both the good and the bad.

YET, RAs are an obvious ne-’
cessity. These people do have spe-
cific purposes. if only to maintain
order and to relate pertinent in-
formation to University residen_ts.
Their presence is valuable. es-.

Students Don ’t

Deserve Funds

Editor. The Pitt News:

Everybody down here is in a
tizzy about why we are not going
to get our state aid money. Aca-
demic types never could see the
forest for the trees. Other peo-
ple who pontificate in this paper
look for the causes for the finan-
cial crisis in the political struc-
ture of the legislature which they
say has created the present im-
mobilism. All the bickering about
what sort of tax should be levied
to procure the extra revenue is
a futile exercise in rhetoric/. You
have all missed the political real-
ities of this situation. Everybody
these days is down on students,
perhaps justifiably. Agnew, Wal-
lace, Al Capp, Eric Hoffer and
many other prominent Americans
frequently assault the current
crop of intellectuals who have
made the universities their pri-1
vate sty. —

signs and dirty things we stoondts

ing last year? No? Well he and his
fellow legislators remember! Can
you blame them for punishing
such disgraceful behavior?

Yes. everyone is down on the
students. Ever talk to a steel
worker about college kids? They
feel in brief that "You +q:1/25/35/sl
college punks are a buncha -% 3/s5/s-
draft dodging commie queers!”
And the academic community is
trying to sell the silent majority
on the idea that it should tax itself
further to provide comforts for
the stoondts. Dream on brothers.

Governor Shafer says we’ve

got to send" more kids to school be-
cause it benefits the whole nation.
Many citizens won’t buy this gar-_
bage anymore. The more kids en-
tering college the more disgust-
ing hippies we see, the more riots
occur, the further the entire socie-
ty has been dragged down. The
reason for this'*is* quite simple. As
anyone“ who has spent any time
within a university will tell you,
our nations colleges have become
breeding grounds for Marxist rev-
olution.

I won’t pay a state income tax
to help these_Pinko Profs contin-
ue their brainwashing of innocent
youth. I have seen young men en-

ter college as basically‘ decent. I
observe that in two short years
they are transformed into raving
communists trying to destroy the
American system. I know what's
going on in this so-called college,
the legislature knows and the si-
lent majority knows. Stalin knew
it too when he wrote: "Give me
control of one generation of a
country‘s youth and I-will run
that country.“

To Procure Funds

Editor. The Pitt News:

- I have observed with consider-
able interest the futile attemps of
the administration. faculty and
students to persuade our politi-
cally-wise, but wary, legislators
to fulfill the commitments the
Commonwealth made to Pitt and
other institutions of higher learn-
ing. While I am sorry that these

tions and how moral their posi-
tion. are always doomed to failure
because the pleadings are not
made in the only language the leg-
islators understand.

The only language the legisla-

tors understand is that which con-
tains political muscle. While the
threats, both implicit and explicit,
made by the administration. fac-
ulty and students are almost al-
ways sincere in such situations.
they are virtually always idle
threats.

If a small, but determined and
politically-wise, group would ap-
proach each legislator and quietly
inform them that a political cam-
paign is going to be mounted in
each legislative district in Penn-
sylvania both in the primary and
general elections, and that this
campaign will be either directed
against them or for them depend-
ing on their conduct regarding the
commitment‘ to Pitt, et al., and if
it is made clear to these legisla-
tors that the group is determined

and willing and able to conduct.

such campaigns, I feel confident
that they will take action and do
what they must do regarding the
commitmentto Pitt. ’

If anyone would like to discuss i
this with me. I would be most hap-.__l _

py to do so. ' ‘

 I Salter Closes

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Friday night was a “great
night” for coach Jim Banner
and the thinclads at the New
York Olympic Invitational in Mad-
ison Square Garden. .

Bryant Salter set a new school
record in the high jump as he
placed second in the event,while
the mile relay teamvposted the
second fastest time in the East
this year in winning its speciality.

‘Salter cleared 6101/2"
high jump. eclipsing his old varsi-
ty mark of 610". He and Olympi-
an Reynaldo Brown both cleared
that height. but Brown was offi-
cially awarded first place on num-
ber of misses.

~~'IIhe._Panthers’ 39.2 per cent gamefield goal average was the_ poor-

points before Mike Paul's basket
opened the cagers’ scoring.

Mike Patcher and Paul O’Gorek
added five consecutive tallies to
the Panther score seven minutes
later to pull the cagers within a
basket of the Lions, 43-41. But
shortly afterwards, any cager
hopes of stifling Penn State twice
within the same season (for the
first time in seven years) were
ruined.

decision to Bob Rust. Dave Young
won the heavyweight match by de-
fault when his. opponent Dennis
Coupe sustained a leg injury.
Despite the losses. Adams felt
his heavyweights performed ad-I
mirably. , ’ 4
"In the closing matches. which
we expected to be close. /our boys

' went out and set the pace and took

control." Adams remarked.

As for the losses, he said, “I
can’t saythat they did anything
wrong. The other guys were pret-
ty good and they deserve a lot of
credit.”

The victory over. Syracuse gives
the matmen a 10-2 record as
they go against Penn State next

Saturday. Penn State is now rank- ‘

ed number one in the East after
their defeat of Navy.

Adams says of the Penn State
match. "We're looking forward to
it. It‘s going to be tough, but there
is. more pleasure in beating a
tough team. ' ‘

      
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
   
  
     
    
   
  
   
    
   
    
   
  
   
   
    
   
      
       
    
    
       
   
      
 

Banner explained that the un-
usual height. of 6'10‘/2” resulted
from the use of metric distances.
Salter also made three attempts
to clear 7’ 1/2” and he was over the
bar on his last attempt, only.-to
come down on top ot it.

The field of high -jumpers in
the meet included Olympian John

Rambo f'rom the Pacific Coast "
Track Club and Joe David from.

the University of Maryland. This
was the first time that «Salter has
beaten David. _ _

In the mile relay, the quartet of
Smittie Brown, Dorel Watley.
John Aiken and Charles Reisen

‘ turned in a 3': 18.6 which is the sec-

ond fastest time recorded in the
East for that event this season.
The timeis also the fastest for the

into _seve_ral fouls. Of the final ten.
Penn State points. six were from
the free throw line. Thus. the Nit-
tany Lions‘ 48 per cent shooting
and an excellently executed stall
handed them a victory which com-
pensated for their previous 61-47
loss in«Pittsburgh.. _ '

“I can't figure out anything

really different between the two-

games,” Ridl stated. “We played
hard, but just didn’t executevwell.”

Throughout thecontest. Penn
State played a/deliberate offen-
sive style similiar to the offense

that Ridl employs. Earlier in the .
season. Lion coach John Bach‘

stated that his squad would go for
the “fast." good shot.

“I, think that our defense
might've made them more deli-
berate than what they usually
are. In the first half. our defense
was really tough." Jim Tweardy.

-ed. ‘A .

When the game began, it ap-

As Syracuse Shatters

Two Freestyle Marks

by JERRY MYERS
The mermen from Syracuse University overcame the

pool.

' Pittsburgh jinx Saturday to humble the Panthers, 69-44, at Trees

\-.

Succumbing to an awesome barrage of swimming, the mermen_
dropped ten of the 13 events to the Orangemen. By picking up seven
second places and five thirds the tankers managed to make it look re-
spectable, but the meet was decided by the seventh event.

It wasa big day for breaking records though. Rick Rowe, finish-

ing second in both the 500 and 1000
yard freestyle races, succeeded
in smashing the school marks in
those events. Rick’s time of 10:-
54.2 eclispsed the record he set
last week in the 1000 by» 15 sec-
onds. He then came back in the 500
to record a time of 5210.7, topping
the old record of‘5.11.7 set by
Robert Levine in 1964. .

The sensation of. the afternoon
was -Rick’s opponent, sophomore
Brian Krause from Syracuse.
Krause, with a time of 10:10.9, not
only broke the Trees Pool record

for the 1000 by 21 seconds, but-

also shattered -the Syracuse mark
for that event. Krause then re-
turnedto record’ a time of 5:00.8
in the 500.which set another new
Trees Pool record. It was quite an
afternoon "for both _Rick_ Rowe and
Brian Kruase. . ‘ .

Coach Bill Grant wasn’t very
disappointedwith the tankers per-
formance. He commented,_ “We
did well. This is the most -points

we’ve scored on them in a good _

number of years.”' .,

The "fact ‘ that the Panthers
couldn’t use their freshmen hurt
somewhat, but Syracuse has some
‘pretty good freshmen of their
own. “Their freshmen beat Col-
gate and Cornell, so-there’s no
doubt-that -he’s got as much to

lose as we do by not using them.
That’s how the ECAC wants to do
it."

The three firsts that the Pan-
thers did manage to salvage of-
fered some of the most exciting
swimming of the afternoon. Tom-
my Hayes turned in a timeiof
222.7 to take the 50 yard free-

style. Al Morrisirecorded a tri-

umph with a tough win in the 200
breast stroke. Al’s time. was
52:23.7, only five-tenths of a second
shy of the record he set last week.

Dave Wessel had some trouble.
in the one-meter diving event, fin-
ishing second after performing a

_ failed dive. Even with the fail dive,

he only missed winning the event
by three points. He came back to
win the high board competition .
with a dazzling total of 301.20,;
C_het Zientel continued to dive well.'.
enough to capture two third places.
Chester, according to Coach

_ Grant, “Has come a long way with

'his diving.” _
After next week’s’ Kent State

meet, ' the mermen tackle the~~

'Monda_y, «February 23, .ll970—THE PirT’NE7ws§;i§5§;e ,

by PETE NYCHIS ~

It was one of those days for Coach Warren Neiger’s gym-
nasts as nothing could go right for them as they went down to
another defeat, this time to powerful Penn State 151.92-113.23.

Penn State didn’t waste any time taking the lead“,15.51-21.06 at

the end of the first event, the floor exercise, by taking all three top -

sports and eventually set the pace for the '£_¢§._£“5i the meetin the small

inanner. -

The only bright spot f'or Neig-
er's gymnasts was once again Joe
Gracik’s brilliant performance on
the side horse. He placed first
once again with a 8.80 barely out-
distancing Penn State’s Mark Av-
ener who scored an 8.77. This
marked the fifth straight time he
has won his event. '

Lowell Meek also did a good
routine on floor exercise but his
8.33 was ‘only good‘ for fourth as
Penn State’s Mark Avener (8.47),
William Mitchell .(8.47)‘ and Tom

Clark (8.57) all placed ahead of

him. A.

In the still rings Scott Bressler
of State took first and two of his
teammates, Mark Avener (8.40)
and William Mitchell (7.77), fol-
lowed. For Neiger’s gymnasts
Jim Billec put inia creditable per-
formance and placed fourth with
his 7.4. Frank Swift showed con-

siderableimprovement and scor-_

ed 7.1 but s__til1 made numerous

mistakes as he held certain holds
over three seconds and was short
on others.

. Penn State didn’t letlup as it
went on to sweepthe top three
sports on each of the last three

, events with Avener, Clark and

Mitchell leading the way again.

In "the long horse Tom Clark’s
9.1 won it followed by James Cor-
rigan (8.95) and Mark Avener
(8.85)._Dave Andrew (8.75) put in
a good performance for Neiger’s
gymnasts but was still only good
for fourth.

State’s Mark Avener won the
parallel bars event (8195) follow-
ed by William Mitchell 58.40) and
Larry Bunes (7.40). Avener also
won the horizontal bars with a
