University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Vol. 71, No. 8_

Friday, September 24, l976

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Political canvassing for the 1976
presidential campaign will be
missing from campus due to Pitt’s
campaigning policy which prohibits
leafleting on University policy.

College Young Republicans
(CYR) President Mamy Abraham
said the Young Republicans will not

be distributing campaign literature
for the upcoming presidential
election.

In the past, Abraham explained,
the CYR had a few run-ins with the
University, because of canvassing
on campus. Since the line of
demarcation separating University
from community property is a fine
one, she said, it’s easy to solicit in
areas prohibited by the University
policy without knowing it.

’ For example, leaﬂets can be
distributed on the sidewalk outside
the Cathedral of Learning but not on

the Cathedral lawn. Those groups
who are cautious and meticulous

enough to stay out of the campus .

boundaries can still leaﬂet.
The Young Socialist Alliance,
which distributed literature last
week, on the Bigelow sidewalk in
front of the Cathedral, is the only
organization this year to pass out
political literature in legal areas.
Al Bowen, coordinator of the
university judicial system explained
the canvassing policy exists because
canvassing on University property
could be construed as an University
endorsement of that candidate.
Bowen said Pitt’s status as a
state-related school makes it
ineligible for state funding if it
contributes funds or in any way
endorses a political ‘candidate who
would have the power to lobby for
legislative appropriations to Pitt.
Canvassing is also prohibited at
state-funded Penn State.

Health Educator, Says

Sex Disease Rate Low  

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

The incidence of sexually trans-

mitted diseases at Pitt is low in
comparison to Allegheny County
statistics, according to Gerry C.
Hyner, health educator at the
Student Health Service.
“The lower incidence of these
diseases on campus suggests
students are not only more
educated, but are taking pre-
cautions against disease transfer,”
‘Hyner said.

According to Hyner, the top
three sexually transmitted diseases
on campus are Herpes Infection,
Nonspeciﬁc Urethritis and Vagini-
tis.

Gonorrhea and syphilis are not-

prevalent at Pitt, H ner noted.

  
 

It is possible to have gonorrhea
and not know it, because 75 to 85%
of the test results are negative,
while later tests often give positive
results. The initial negative results
show the difﬁculties of gathering
accurate gonorrhea statistics,‘
Hyner said.

According to VENUS—a hot line
for free information on sexually
transmitted diseases—v blood test-
ing positive may indicate a patient
has sugar diabetes, mononucleosis,
is pregnant or has syphilis.

VDRL test reports cannot con-
ﬁrm syphilis until one month after
contraction of the disease, Hyner
explained.

Last year the number of cases of
gonorrhea and syphilis in Alle-

involved now to save the oceans.

A University Prohibits Leafletting

Prosecutors for the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) at
Penn State University brought
charges against Penn State for
violating the ﬁrst amendment by
restricting freedom of speech and
the right to hear what others have to
say.

The Centre County Common
Pleas Court ruled last December that
Penn State’s canvassing policy was
constitutional. The ACLU, however,
is appealing the decision.

The ACLU chapter in Pittsburgh
has not attacked the canvassing
policy at Pitt.

An ACLU spokesman said the Pitt
policy was “perfectly understand-
able and fine.”

Although the University may not
endorse a candidate, students,
faculty and staff have the right to
support the candidate of their
choice.

Urban study says

Parking-Top Problem At Pitti

BYBILLMOORE

Results of a study by the Centerfor
Urban Research on students’ views

I. of the quality of life in Oakland have

been released, with parking listed as
the most serious problem by the
majority of those responding to a
questionnaire.

The study was conducted in the
spring of 1975, in response to
concerns voiced at that time by

~student leaders and Chancellor

Wesley Posvar.

Four thousand students ‘were
chosen at random from a list of all
students-including fulltime, part-
time, undergraduate, graduate and
night students—and questionnaires
were mailed to them. The results of
the study were tabulated from 927

solicitation, the Student Union and other University property is off limits
to campaigners for this year's election.

questionnaires which were return-
ed.

About 44% of those responding
expressed some dissatisfaction with
the Oakland community, with 38%
responding favorably, and 18%

_ neutral.

About 75% said the Oakland
community was worse than their
home neighborhoods, and the
majority said they expected there
would be no change in the area in the
near future.

Asked to name the aspect of the
campus they liked least, 33.1%
listed parking problems, followed by
22% listing traffic congestion and
Other responses
included crime, housing conditions
and pollution.

A large majority of students listed
Oakland’s best trait as its
accessibility to various facilities.
Accessibility to cultural facilities

was listed as the aspect liked most I

about the area by 32% of students
participating in the study, with

accessibility to enterntainment‘

facilities listed by 24%, accessibility
to education facilities listed by 23%
and accessibility to shopping areas
listed by 16%.

A series of problem areas in the
Oakland community were listed for
students receiving the question-
naire, and they were asked to rate
them as serious problems, minor
problems or no problem at all.
Parking was deemed a serious
problem by 59% of those respond-

Casey Plans Ed. Tax Break

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

A tax credit for college and
graduate education costs was
proposed by Bob Casey, candidate
in the 18th Congressional District
race, yesterday at a meeting of the
Pitt College Republicans.

“Too much money for schools is
siphoned off by federal bureau-
cratic expenses and only a little bit
gets to where it is needed,” Casey
said yesterday.

Under Casey's proposal,
American could_ pay for another
person's college expenses and in
return would receive a deduction
on his income tax return.

This plan would eliminate the
federal education bureaucracy and
save the taxpayers money. accord-
ing to Casey.

An elimination of the bureau-
cratic paperwork at Pitt involved

any «

with obtaining federal grants would
save money and cut tuition,
according to John Bradley, candi-
date in the 14th U.S. Congressional
District, which includes Oakland
and the Pitt campus.

The Pittsburgh area needs
improvements in transportation
thrdugh a network of beltways and
a rapid rail transit system,
Casey said.

“Pittsburgh residents pay four
cents a gallon into the highway
trust fund, but we *don’t get the
highways Harrisburg and Philadel-
phia get,” Casey said.

Casey promised he would put
pressure on state and federal
highway officials and that he would
employ a full—time staff member to
work for more local highways if he
is elected.

Programs for stimulating energy
exploration. lowering the drinking

age to 18 and halting congressional
spending for junkets also were
proposed by Casey. .

Casey characterized himself as a
“fiscal conservative" and his
opponent Douglas Walgren as a
“big spending, McGovern lib-
eral." Casey and Walgren are
seeking the seat currently held by
Senate aspirant John Heinz.

Walgren has lost bids for

election three times before and his
mother had lost twice before him.
Casey said calling Walgren “a
loser by inheritance."
“My chances of defeating the
incumbent Moorhead are less then
even." Bradley said, “But we are
picking up support in Squirrel Hill
and the suburbs."

“Moorhead has done an ade-
quate job in housing but very little
else in 18 years in office." Bradley
said.

Americans Lack Nutritional Education

BY BETSY NORMAN

Potato chips, pretzels, milk
shakes, french fries... The average
American's staple foods. Every
red-blooded American knows
where neighborhood McDonald’s
is, and that's the problem.

One thing that the U.S. is
evidently lacking is good nutrition
education according to Dr. Dave
Houston, a Pitt economics profes-
sor, in a speech at a malnutrition
workshop Tuesday night.

The workshop entitled “The
Business of Malnutrition,” was
held at Pitt in conjunction with the
National Week for Concern for
World Hunger which ends Sunday.

The purpose of the workshop,
according toLCheryl Morden,
coordinator of the workshop and
Pitt’s Campus Minister from the
University and City Ministries, was
“to raise the issue of malnutrition
in the minds of the public,
especially Pitt students.”

I hope that the workshop will

gheny County dipped for the first
time in eleven years. Although this
decrease is encouraging, Hyner
showed concern for a new strain of
gonorrhea which can resist penicil-
lin. This strain has not been
reported at Pitt.

National statistics suggest
gonorrhea is out of control, making
its elimination a “futile task,”
Hyner said. _

The Health Service offers free
counseling and information on
family planning and sexually
transmitted diseases. Hyner, and
Jan DeVoe, a family planning
nurse, are responsible for the
program.

Hyner said he plans to start
seminars on family planning later
this term similar to those required
for resident advisors in the dorms.

The Health Service provides free
routine pelvic exams, Hyner said.
Patients requiring further treat-
ment are referred to the Allegheny
County Health Service located on
Forbes Avenue.

Hyner said referrals are made

congestion, air pollution, vandal-

‘ ism, cleanliness of the community,
housing conditions and population
density.

In line with their responses to
previous questions, the students
listed parking as the facility needed
most in the area. They also
expressed a desire for “more open
green areas,” better street repair
and more apartments. The need for
more quick food chains was given the
lowest priority.

The report was authored by Henry
Y. H. Wong of the University Center
for Urban Research.

public in general to seriously
examine their own diets and
lifestyles," Morden said.

‘Father Fred Just, a second
coordinator of the workshop and
member of the Capuchin Justice
and Peace Commission, conducted
the workshop.

A film expose of the malnutrition
caused by infant formula in
Africa—Bottle Babies—was shown
to a sparse crowd.

Houston then gave an overall
picture of the economic basis of
hunger and malnutrition. He
commented on America’s role in
the third world’s malnutrition
problem saying “our system has
always produced poverty” and
adding “the single most important
cause of malnutrition is poverty.”
He also said that poverty is
partially “a problem with how
production is organized in our own
part of the world.”

The workshop, which was
sponsored by several Pittsburgh
groups such as the Pittsburgh
diocese and the Semple Street Food
Co-op, was only part of a week long

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Eternally Grateful

Now that the University Center for Urban Research has completed its
study of student attitudes about the Oakland area, there is no longer any
reason for student leaders and administrators to debate exactly what

students want. It is parking.

That of course con1es as no surprise to anyone who has beenon campus
to anytime inthe last ten years. From 9 a.m. to well past dinner time,
ﬁnding someplace to park in Oakland is as great a challenge as a Pitt

student can ﬁnd on campus.

More people listed parking as a serious problem on campus than listed
such other common maladies as crime, litter and vandalism. That
statistic, along withtheother problems given ahigh priority (crime, litter,
and vandalism), clearly outline what it is that makes life in Oakland less

than ideal.

In its expansion over the past years, the University has spawned most of
these problems, and its responsibility to both the students and the

community is evident.

Chancellor Posvar should receive his copy of the report soon, and it is
hoped he and other administrators will read it and put the expressed
concerns high on their lists of priorities. ’

The university has made great strides through its years of expansion in
undergraduate and graduate education, and in its professional schools.
But it has a reputation second only to Temple for urban blight.

Thetruth is, Oakland is not as bad as some seemto think. But even a
small amount of crime is too much, and the same goes for litter.

As for parking, it is clear student leaders will never make much
headwayinthis area. The Commuter Association has tried for years, and
ﬁnally justfolded up itstents and quit. Student Govermnent leaders have
tried, but the results were unencouraging.

The problem is one of money, and politics: and that clearly calls for an
effort fromthetop. The moneywasfoundforthe Professional Quadrangle
now receiving ﬁnishing touches’ and the substantial  tangles

were cleared.

Ifthe same sort of administrative ﬁnesse were applied to  a bit
more parking in the Oakland area, the results may be surprising. And

students would be eternally grateful.

Rules for Fire

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

With ﬁres. smoke and false
alarms so much a part of the
campus life this year. it is probably
time to trot out the age old wisdoms
about what to do when ﬁre strikes
your dorms.

There are some obvious rules,
Don’t panic. Don’t scream.
Proceed in an orderly fashion to the
nearest ﬁre escape. Don’t kick.
Move quickly and don't stumble.
Smoke? Get down on the ﬂoor and
get out. Don’t get on elevators.

But what about the important
question everyone must face in
those precious four seconds be-
tween the ﬁrst alert and the ﬁrst
ﬂames licking at our knees?

Some have said the style differs
from one person to the next, but
generally people look to glance and

News Article L
Misleading

I am writing to clarify several
incorrect statements which were
printed by the Pitt News in its
September 22 issue under the
heading “Psych Center Offers
Help." The article, which was an
attempt to communicate to Pitt
students the availability of the
services of the Clinical Psychology
Center, may prove to be misleading
to your readers.

The Clinical Psychology Center

, is a facility which offers psycholog-
ical, not psychiatric, services. The
Pitt News gave the continuation of
the article on page 8 a heading
entitled: “Psychiatric Outpatient
Help Here.” Along these lines, I
was incorrectly quoted on page 8.
The quote refers to “graduate
student working with the patient.”
As we are a psychological, not
psychiatric or medical facility, we
do not refer to our clients as
“patients.” We do not regard our
clients as “sick” nor “mentally
ill,” but rather as individuals who
are seeking help in dealing with
emotional discomfort or with
concerns about their behavior or
life situations.

A further misquote read: “we
have to tape all of the sessions so
we can evaluate the effectiveness
of the graduate student working
with the patient." Most of our
clinical sessions are audio and/or
video taped. While the Clinical
Psychology Center offers its
services to the greater Pittsburgh
community, the Center's primary
function is to provide a clinical
teaching and research facility for

Ph.D candidates in clinical psycho-
logy. The audio and videotapes
serve the educational function of
the Center. The recordings are
used not to evaluate effectiveness
of the graduate student, though
this is a concern, but to facilitate
student instruction thereby ulti-
mately promoting the client’s
welfare. All clients seeking service
at the Center are informed of the
Center's training function, the
need for taping, and the fact that

_all information (oral, written and

recorded) is kept confidential
within the Center.

Most clients agree readily to our
Center's need for taping. A few do
have questions about the policy and
most are reassured by our
explaination of how the tapes are
used and .by our policy of
conﬁdentiality. The misquotation
in the Pitt News article that “If a
person refuses to give his
permission to use the video
equipment, we have to ask them
to go somewhere else" gives an
erroneous impression. If a client is
not comfortable with our pro-
cedures, the client is referred to
another appropriate agency or
professional. In discussing this
issue with your reporter, I believe I
clariﬁed the fact that individuals
requesting service at the Center
are never just “asked to go
somewhere else.‘ Every effort is
made to assist them in securing the
required psychological services
from another agency or profes-
sional. _

It should be noted, also, that the
University of Pittsburgh Coun-
seling and Placement Service is the
major resource for the members of
the university community who seek
guidance or counseling with
personal as well as other problems.

hell to pay.

While the Clinical Psychology
Center offers its services both to
students and to others, its
resources are limited and its
services are restricted to those
consonant with its educational
objectives.

Again, Again...
Why Fraternities

This letter is in response to David
McDonald's letter on “Why
Fraternities” published in the
September 17th edition of the Pitt
News. Mr. McDonald, your
question of fraternities has long
been a topic of discussion brought
forth by non-Greeks who are
ignorant about the affairs of
fraternities and who never take the
time to adequately add to their
knowledge in this area. A fraternity
is a group of men who believe in and
are bonded together by certain
ideals. The ways in which
fraternities socialize have changed
since their conception, but so have
the social standards of society.
However, the ideals still exist and
serve to hold the fraternity together.
A fraternity differs from most
organizations _in that it is more
structured and closely knit. Frater-
nities are under constant attack
concerning their social activities
because of their excellent organiza-
tional efforts. There is little
difference between a party held by
the XYZ club. the Xth ﬂoor of

The ﬁrst thing to take is any and
all forms, slips of paper, cancelled
checks and other paraphenalia
related to your existence here at
the University. The reasons are
obvious. Without them you might
as well have burned along with
your album collections.

In another way, taking that paper
will probably help (however inﬁnt-
ismally) the supression of the ﬁre,
since infernos love nothing better
than a choice selection of course
registration cards, grant applica-
tions and official letters.

Next, take the notebooks from
your most‘ difficult courses. It
_ would be nice if you take them all,
of course, but in an emergency
situation you have to face up to the
fact that some courses are more
important than others.

Next come your tickets to home
football games. Think of how long
you waited for those goodies. Are
you willing to consign these to the
ﬂames? Hardly. Especially with
Pitt now ranking number three in
the UPI listings.

That bottle of pennies you’ve
been saving. Believe it or not, you
might have one of those pennies
with a three-eyed Indian or
McCormick Hall or a fraternity. The
only difference is that a fraternity is
more organized. One of the reasons
why fraternities maintain houses is
to have a supervised place for social
activities. Granted, fraternity
parties make noise, but what party
doesn't. If the XY Z club maintained
a house and held parties there, they
00 would come under close scrutiny
for noise. However, fraternities
recognize that they are a part of a
neighborhood and are striving to
maintain good relations with
neighbors. As an undergraduate, I
remember many times rising early
the morning after a party to pick up
litter around my fraternity house.
On those mornings, I recall seeing
such people as Ed Riefenstahl (past
IFC president) not only picking up
litter around his house, but walking
down the street picking up litter in
front of all houses.
In your letter Mr. McDonald, you
stated that the only purpose
fraternities serve is to ‘ ‘keep the tap
ﬂowing.” If fraternity men are
nothing but constant beer guzzlers,
why are eighty percent of the ﬁve
hundred largest corporations in
America led by fraternity men. Also
many political leaders of our country
are fraternity men. Men such as
Senator Henry Jackson, Governor
Ronald Reagan and Senator Hugh
Scott to name a few. ‘
I've been involved very intimately
with the Greek sstem on two college
campuses and during this associa-

something, which are probably

Clean underwear. Let’s face it.
By the time you get outside every
television and news photographer
in the metropolis will be waiting,
not to mention every person you
ever tried to impress or befriend.
Would you want them to see you in
dirty underwear? Take the time to
change. Even with the ﬂoor above
you caving in, you'll be glad you
did.

worth the‘ entire gross national
product of South Korea. You'll
need that kind of money after the
ﬁre to get more clothes, more
albums, another penny bottle and
the answers to the ﬁnal exams that
you won’t study for because the
rest of your notes were burned.

Socks. Yes socks. Now there
have been a lot of disparaging
comments about the worth of socks
in an extreme crisis, but the truth is
that in a crunch nothing consoles
like a shot of Thunderbird wine and
a pair of very dry and wooly socks.
Clean ones are preferable.

Finally, wake up your roommate.
It's only fair, and besides, they can
help you carry some of the stuff out
of the ﬂaming building.

tion I’ve seen fraternities do such
things as adopt an overseas child,
collect money for charities and
provide food for needy familites. Ask
the Allegheny Valley School for
Exceptional Children what great
beer guzzlers fraternity men are.
Last‘ year, your so called beer
guzzlers collected, in conjunction
with Pitt sororities, over $14,000
for the school. Also, consider the
effect on the University if the
Greeks would shun Pitt activities.
Each year, Greeks usher for
parents weekend, homecoming
events and participate in the
mentor program. For homecoming,
fraternities not only boost school
spirit, but also build ﬂoats and
banners at their own expense.

Think of the revenue, in the form
of alumni contributions, that the
University would lose if fraternities
withdrew their support from
homecoming. Alumni would
wonder what had happened to all the
school spirit that they were used to
seeing. I'm sure that this would
affect their contributions to the
University.

In conclusion Mr. McDonald, I
suggest that you take a little time to
find out about fraternities. If you
approach the matter objectively, you
will ﬁnd that a fraternity is an
organization which provides its

.members with the opportunity to
learn to be learders as well as to live
and work with others.

Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting Not A Joke

  
 

BY KEN GORMLEY

After swallowing two beers in
rapid succession, the young dere-
lict tramped out of Allie’s Bar and
staggered through the streets of

~~ Oakland.

From the scruffy clothes he
wore——tattered American Legion
jacket, Schmidt’s t-shirt, and
railroad cap—it looked like he had
attended a Goodwill clearance sale
the week before (and arrived too
late to find any bargains).

As he walked determinedly
towards the old Shadyside church
that was his destination, the
vagabond’s greasy hair swung
from side to side like a linp
windshield wiper.

In front of the chapel the bum
paused, looked quickly around, and
crept stealthily up to the door. His
sweaty ﬁst grabbed the handle.
Locked.

“Aargh," he muttered, and
dragged his wasted body across the
street. He accosted a neighbor.

“Do you know when the
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting
is?” the low-life demanded. “It
was supposed to be tonight.”

The skinny little man shot one
glance at the young wretch, and
inched towards his door. “I
th-th-think it’s tomorrow n-night”
his voice quivered.

“Rrahh,” the derelict bellowed,
leaving the little man shivering in
his boots. In a second, the bum
was gone—running down the street
back towards Oakland.

Was the derelict so drunk that he
didn’t know what day it was? Were
his brains so scrambled he couldn’t
remember when his A.A. meeting
would be held?

No. He was nothing but a sober
fool. I should know. After all - the
young derelict was me.

THE HISTORY OF ALCOHOLISM

Alcoholism was a problem long
before the words “Schmidts” and-
“Iron City” became part of the
English language.

Cave men who couldn’t cope
with the daily routine——hunting
wild boars and making necklaces
out of bones-—soon learned to
escape by drinking the magic
juices.

And the royalty of Ancient
Rome, weary of ﬁghting off tribes
of barbarians decade after decade,
found that a dozen or so goblets of
wine a day was enough to put their
heads in the clouds (and eventually
on silver platters).

But the problem is worse than
ever today. It strikes women,
children, college students, and
even and occasional German
Sheperd(and you thought it was a
real laugh to feed your doggy beer
at parties).

So I decided to disguise myself

as a derelict (Go ahead and say it,
wise guy, ‘‘It probably didn’t take
much disguising.” Come to think
of it, you’re right) and pay a visit to
an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
Just to see if there was any hope
for the victims of this dread
disease.

Luckily, my second trip to the
A.A. was more successful thanthe
first. This time the door was open-

INSIDE A.A.

Wearing the same tattered
clothes I had sported the night

before (by this time a little more

tattered--and a lot more smelly), I
shufﬂed nervously into the church.

“What if these people find out
I’m an impostor,” kept pounding
through my head. “I’ll probably
end up in a dark alley with a wine
bottle planted between my ears.”

I tried to ﬁght back such
sobering thoughts, and poked my
head cautiously into the fir_st room I

  

came to. Ooops...wrong place.
There were just a few upstanding-—
looking people sitting around
sipping coffee and chatting. It was
obviously a Knights of Columbus
social.

“Come on in," an older
gentleman said to me. “Is this
your first A.A. meeting?" My
knees almost buckled under.
“Duhh...yes. Yep. First meeting.
Yep," Ibabbled, nearly swallowing
my tongue.

The gentleman escorted me to a
seat in the large hall, and
introduced himself as Harry.
“Don’t worry son,” he consoled
me, getting me a glass of iced tea.
“I haven't had a drink for seven
years. We’ll have you doing the
same.”

God forbid, Ithought. No more
Original specials? No more
pitchers at the Keg? It was
frightening to even think about it.

By now the hall was almost
filled. No, most of the members
weren't ragged old bums with pints
of whiskey in their pockets. They
were well-dressed men and wo-
men. The kind you see in church
on Sunday. And young, normal-
looking college kids. (The kind you
rarely see in church on Sunday).
To tell you the truth, I was the
biggest bum in theiwhole crowd.

“Good evening,” a voice boom-
ed from the podium. “My name’s
Ed. And I’m an alcoholic.” ’)This
guy an alky? I couldn’t believe it.

he sold long ago.

Syria Mosque concert

Band: Excellent,

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

After hearing ecstatic praises
from their fans, reading rave
reviews of past concert triumphs,
and listening to samplings of their
recorded works; I went to the Syria
Mosque Tuesday night expecting a
hell of a lot from the Band.

I was anticipating, and getting
up, for perhaps the ﬁnest concert of
the year. No, make that event.
The Band are more than a
run-of-the mill rock band; they are
living legends.

Their early work with Dylan in
the mid-sixties, the impact of their
ﬁrst two albums, and the inacces-
sabile, low proﬁle they maintained
in the 70’s, has worked the Band
into the subconscious of ~ the
American music mind.

You may not think about the
group for months on end, but the
Band is never forgotten. They are
always there.

Maybe I expected too much from
the Band Tuesday night. But after
the Band's short performance, I
was not moved to grab the lapels of
the first person I passed on the
street to shout about the super-
group I had just seen.

Nor was I ready to scamper out
and purchase every precious
minute of vinyl ever grooved by the
Band. I was quite frankly...puzz-
led.

I didn’t know how to digest the
Band. Should I praise them for
their record-perfect, professional
musicianship? Chastise them for
their lack of audience rapport this
particular night? Call them rip-offs
for charging eight bucks a ticket,
then playing for little over an hour?

Well, let’s say for openers,
The Band concert was above
average, as far as concerts go. But
it was hardly an event.

Once people recovered from the
initial thrill of the Band’s presence,
and had grabbed their souvenir

7 pictures, the concert at times

downright lumbered.
The Band is not an exciting
visual act- Except for Robbie

but Lifeless

The Band

Robertson’s and Rich Danko’s
occasional toe taps and shoulder

swaying, lifesize cardboard cutouts
and an excellent stereo could have
substituted for them on the
Mosque stage.

And a people's’ band? They
didn’t even attempt to play to the
audience. I expected some down
home, free ﬂo_wing, good natured
rapport. There was none.

It seemed as if they thought their
mystique would be shattered, if
they uttered more than a lifeless
.“thank you”.

The cold and calculated stage

rock n’ roll. Particuliary note-
worthy were Hillman’s vocals on
two Steve Still’s numbers,"it
Doesn't Matter” and “The Witchin
Hour”.

Unfortunately though, watching
the Band was like watching a good
television show. You can see, you
can hear.... but you can never
really touch. ,

  Artist Carves Into
  Depths of Africa

BY MREA CSORBA

Pittsburgh hasn’t seen much
ancient African art. Neither has
Yourba Batonga. And that’s what
prompted him to take up the
carving knife six years ago.

At a definite disadvantage,
Batonga started carving artistic
representations _o§.~.p,as’t Black
history. Disadvantage, because he
has had no physical contact with
the culture and tribes he set out to
represent.

He relied on instinct to take him
back to where and when the life of
his race was nurtured. The Kings
and Princes of Benni, the legend-
ary face of Zulu, the King of Black
Ancient Egypt, all interpretations
of what he calls ‘Old Africa,
primitive and beautiful.’

And his soul’s voyage was
successful. In an exhibit of his
explorations at the Statue of Life

shows us raw, imaginative ﬁgure
sculptures that ring true to their
predecessors.

I, being white, am not qualiﬁed
to truly judge. And though they
struck a chord of authenticity
within me, Irelied on the experienc
ed judgement of native Jamaican
artist, and manager of Statue of
Life, Van-De Campbell, who has
been exposed to African art in
Jamaica and California.

Campbell explains, “Batonga’s
art is more primitive than real
primitive African art is. Form
dominates these more than design.

And they are more ﬁnished, have

more reﬁneness to them than

their feel well."

Batonga realizes the unpolished
aspect of his works. He freely
admitts that “at the present time I
am at the half-way mark in
bringing to life, that quality and

Lynott's Efforts
Gvet Boss Spotlight

Jailbreak
Thin Lizzy

Mercury srm 1-1081
BY J .V.FARERI

The cliche is bass players are
bland personalities that are best
kept in the limelight. Frustrated
bassists who don’t fit the mold
must launch into projects of their
own to ﬁnd satisfaction, while the
Jaggers of the world hog up the
stardom.

But Phil Lynott is changing all
that. The Thin Lizzy bass player
not only writes nearly everything
the band plays but also sings it and
is their undisputed ‘star.’

One wonders if Lynott would
stage a bassist’s revenge and usurp
the lead instruments with his own.
He doesn’t, though his guitarist’s
music carries a distinct bass ﬂavor.
Their swift stabbing chords are at
once the unit and heart of Thin
Lizzy’s rock, over which Lynott
unbridles an occasional guitar
solo.

The album opens with unmiti-
gated rock n’ roll. Bass and guitar
forge together into mighty chords
that jump toward the electric
whining refrain. Lynott's terse
stop-and-start lyrics suggest a
gruff, rough-edged Bruce Spring-
steen. “Angel from the Coast”

Deodato
Very Together—MCA 2219

Soundtrack from W. C. Fields and
Me, MCA 2092

Soundtrack from Swashbuckler
MCA 2096

Look out all you Trekkies! If
you’ve been hearing that new disco
version of the “Theme from Star
Trek” have no fear, Deodato’s here
with a new LP called Very Together
that’s loaded with the disco dance
beat. The group under the inspired
direction of Eumir Deodato helped to
usher in the now popular disco sound
with its mod version of the ‘ ‘Theme
from 2001: A Space Odyssey.”

In its latest album, Deodato
blends a number of elemental
inﬂuences to get the effect of
impressive orchestration and inter-
esting arrangements. Deodato
wrote ﬁve of the eight selections and
does all of the keyboard and
synthesizer work himself.

Three numbers in particular stand
out on this album. “Peter Gunn”
brings in a variety of instrument
mixes as well as some ﬁne vocals
from the Ellington Sisters. The

  

 brass on this cut sounds tremen-
 dous.

“Spanish Boogie” opens with a

 wailing guitar, goes into solo

trumpet then adds strings and
rhythm guitars for body. It comes off
a bit like Barry White but woodwinds
and vocals save the piece.

“Juanita” maintains a strong,
pulsating bass throughout, along
with Latin percﬁssion, the Moog
system and a terrific sax solo. In the
last moments of “Black Widow”
Deodata falls prey to a common,
cheap way of ending a song—the
fade-out. This is a sign of laziness on
the part of the composer unless he
wants to achieve certain effects from
the fading.

Henry Mancini has some ﬁlm’

scores to his credit that are rated
pretty high andthey deserve it. He is
a very talented composer. However
W. C. Fields and Me does not quite
reach the standard of excellence of
Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Days of Wine
and Roses and The Pink Panther.

The gm ' th f h ﬂ’ k

   

     
   

captures the sarcasm, loneliness
and melancholy of the great
comedian. Likewise the Hollywood
theme and “Carlotta’s Theme” add
bounce and thoughtful, reflective
inﬂuences throughout the picture.
But the real star of the movie is W.
C. himself and Rod Steiger in the role

319'

is superb. It is the selections frombt

the ﬁlm and quotations from Fields
that make this LP interesting. Some
background narration about Fields
is added by Valerie Perrine in the
role of Carlotta, Fields’ mistress for
14 years.

Fields was against “establish-
ments” of all kinds before it was
fashionable to be so. This is pointed
out very well in the bits of dialogue
from “dissertation on S.O.B. ‘s”
and “The IRS Incident.”
had a severe case of the inferiority
blues and felt keenly competitive
with Charlie Chaplin. Fields rated
himself number two; then state :
“Two’s not a number, nobody
counts past one.”‘ These bits of
dialogue plus the sporadic instru-
mental solos make this album worth
the effort put into it.

So you like sentimental moments
cheap adventurethemes and just
plain ordinary ﬁlm scores?
you'll love the soundtrack from
Swashbuckler. ANd as is the case
with so many of these would be

“new Henry Mancini.”

Booters Hosting Rockets Tonight

BY JIM LEWIS

Here’s the latest from Holly-
wood.

THE PITT SOCCER STORY: In
this ﬂick, dating to the early 70s;
Pitt head coach Leo Bemis is faced
with graduation problems, laek of a
winning attitude, lack of money,
lack of fans, lack of wins, lack of
everything. The future is dark, and

Bemis resorts to karate, walking

barefoot and smashing windshields
as he heads dejectedly into the
sunset.

But now, a sequel has been
created: .

THE PITT SOCCER STORY,
PART II: A contemporary movie
set in the fall of 1976. Bemis ﬁnds‘
an All-America candidate, ﬁnds a
young‘ crop of surprising talent,
ﬁnds a winning attitude, ﬁnds wins
and ﬁnds happiness in his 24th
year as the Panther coach. True,
he still lacks fans and money in this
sequel, but even Billy Jack suffered
a little in his second-parter.

The truth is, Pitt soccer looks
much brighter right now than it has
in four years. The Panthers boast a
1-2 record against some of college
soccer’s best, a great performance
against a skilled University of Cork
team (a 1-1 tie), a A new-found

I offense and ‘a sturdy defense,

anchored by All America hopeful
goaltender Frank Bucci.

Bucci, a junior, notices a great
change in this year’s Panther
squad.

“In the past, if the opposition

scored a goal, I felt that our offense
couldn’t get it back,” he said.
“But now, I feel the offense can
score and get back into the game.
And this year’s defense has a lot of
potential—more potential than last
year’s.”

$3

Which is lot of potential. Last
year,_ Pitt gave up only 16 goals in
14 games. ‘Pretty good for a young
club. But this year’s team is even
younger.

“We have a lot of new starters,”
Bucci claimed. “In the last two

Golfers Edgest. Vincent's,
Set For 5th Pitt Invitational

BY JIM PANE

_ The Panthergolf team is all set

-for “the big one” today as coach

Steve Petro prepares his new Blue
and Gold team set-up.

The “big one," as described by
Petro, is the Fifth Annual Pitt
Invitational Golf Tournament which
will host 17 (possibly .18) teams at

the Cherry -Hills Inn’ and Country .

Club in MacDonald, Pa. Tee off is
set for 12:30 p.m.

The Blue, or primary, team is
headed by senior captain Bill
Burkhardt, who is coming off a
medalist performance by shooting

' a 76 in Tuesday's 397-405 win over

St. Vincent College at’ Latrobe.
Senior Jeff Nagel leads the back-up
Gold team, which, according to
Petro, “shows promise.’ ’

Petro explained that his Blue and
Gold squads are individual teams
and will ‘compete against each
other “just as if they were
opponents." '

The tourney is a shotgun affair,
which allows all 108 golfers to
participate at the same time.
“This method makes it possible to
play more people," Petro said.

Petro coached the Panthers to
fourthpand ninth-place ﬁnishes in
the last two Pitt tournaments and
into his third» against
.. extremely tough opponents.”

Along with the two participating
Pitt squads, the ﬁeld of six-man
teams is rounded out by Buquesne,
Carnegie-Mellon, Robert Morris,
Westminster, Allegheny, Mercy-

-i:.al_§urst, California State, West

Liberty (who hopes to send two

.‘teams), Butler County Community
College. Youngstown, Gannon,.

College of Steubenville, St. Vin-
cent, Allegheny College (Mead-

ville) and Edinboro (winner of last
year's tournament). b

Looking over Monday’s dissap-
pointing last-place ﬁnish in ~
Youngstown and Tuesday's victory
over- St. Vincent, Petro evaluates
his troops by saying, “I'm happy
with the young fellows on the team,
and I'm hoping to see these kids
progress." ~

games we really looked good.
We've been getting impressive
showings from our offense. I think
you'll see Pitt score some goals in
the future.”

Hopefully the future includes

p 7:30 tonight at Pitt Stadium, where

the Panthers will host Slippery
Rock (2-1).

“If we beat Slippery Rock,”
Bucci said seriously, “we’ll have a
chance to make the NAIA playoffs.
But we have to beat Slippery Rock

‘to go anywhere.”

That will be tough; the Rockets,
who've compiled a fantastic 31-5
record in the past two years, boast

-a’veteran squad which includes

high-scoring Art Rex and Panther
nemesis Kamal Houari.

But Pitt will have an ace in the
hole———the goalie. ,

"Bucci does things that catch the
eye," Bemis said. “He’s quick. If
he stays healthy and continues to
get votes as the season goes along,
he’ll have a shot at All-America.”

Bucci's friend and Bethel Park
high school buddy, sophomore
winger Tim Pearson, agrees.

“Frank had a great game at
Davis and Elkins (Pitt lost 1-0 in
overtime). And last year at West
Virginia, he made 31 saves. The
defense always seems to hold,”
Pearson said.

This year, though, things may be
different. The offense, with Marty
Moyer, Mark Nigh, Pearson, Rich
Roccon, Todd Wawrousek and
Randy Gyory, looks like it has

ﬁnallyrcaught up to the stubborn
defense—Kim Blasko, Craig Con-
nolly. Tom Murphy, Karl Nigh,
Irwin Siegel and Bucci.

Bucci has the talent to make All

America-—the ﬁrst time such an
honor has been considered by any
Panther player in the last ten years.
But when asked how he feels being
touted as a prospect, Bucci looked
down at the ﬂoor and said, “I’d
rather build up soccer more than
myself. I'd rather see more fans.
We have to get fans.”

Such humbleness can shake the
earth. Hopefully, such talents like
Bucci can shake up Slippery Rock.

And if the Panthers’ success
story remains on track, the Pitt
Panther soccer team could get its
name in lights this season.

Murphy Team Leader

BY MARK MURPHY

Tom Murphy has a rare
perspective concerning this year’s
Pitt soccer team. As a four-year
starter and one of just a few
experienced players, Murphy can
compare the 1976 club with some
more recent versions. He likes
what he sees.

“We have a real nice team this

“year,” the senior fullback com-

mented. “We’re young with a lot
of freshman and sophomores but
they are playing real good soccer.

We're inexperienced and it will
take some time. This is deﬁnitely
the best team we’ve had since I
have been here.”

Despite the relative youth of the
Panthers, this year’s schedule will
help them grow up in a hurry.

“We do have a tough schedule
this year but we have a tough
schedule every year,” Murphy
said. “We play four nationally
ranked teams (Akron, Davis &
Elkins, Temple and _Penn State)
and then there are others which are
close to being ranked.”

Murphy himself did not start
playing soccer until his high school
days, but quickly picked up a love
for the game that keeps- him

playing all year round, including
the summer when he competes in
two different leagues.

Playing for Upper Merion high
school in the Philadelphia suburb
of King of Prussia, Murphy
garnered all-state honors his senior

year. When no recruiters came
knocking his doors down with
‘scholarship offers, he chose Pitt for
a variety of reasons.

“I decided to come to ‘Pitt
because I wanted to go to la-w
school and I needed a big school for
that. Plus I knew I could probably
start here right away.”

Play he has and in many
different positions too. In his four
seasons he has been a halfback, on

Field Hockeylnbebut  

BY PATTY, TASCARELLA

Pantherette ﬁeld hockey
makes its debut at 10:30 a.m. at
Tree.tField against Fairmont State,
and it looks like a rough season
ahead for head coach Janet
McDowell and her ﬂedgling team.

First of all, the final decision to
add ﬁeld-hockey to the women’s
sports program was made last
March, not only after high school
seasons had ended, also after the
outstanding players had been
recruited by other schools.

Then with little time to publicize
the sport, the roster was small.
According to McDowell, most of
the players heard _of ﬁeld hockey
through “talk among students, a

September meeting for. beginning:

athletes and bulletin. "board no-_
tices. ’ ’ She estimates that only half
of her team has had experience in
the sport. ‘ V

Obviously, this will be a building
year with focus on skill develop-
ment, positioning thorough un-
derstanding of the game and team
unity.

Field hockey, actually far more
similar to soccer than ice hockey, is
very popular in eastern Pennsyl-

vania, according to Sandy Bullman,
women’s athletic director. Since a
high percentage) of Pitt students
are from eastern Pennsy vania,
student demand for ﬁeld hockey as
a varsity sport was higher than
requests for softball or _powder-puff
football. -
McDowell, who holds a Section
A umpires rating in ﬁeld hockey,
started out as an assistant coach at
her alma mater, Ohio University.
For the past ﬁve years, she served
as head coach at Eastern Michigan

University. Her goals for her ﬁrst
season at Pitt are oriented toward
building rather than aiming for
championship slots.

Fairmont State should be tough
opposition, but Slippery Rock will
be the strongest opponent on the
schedule. The October.8 meeting
with the Rockettes will be the
Pantherettes’ third away game in a
row. Coupled with the 'Rock’s
-reputation, that would be a difﬁcult
match for even an experienced
team.

Aquettes Seeking Aid

Synchronized swimming is a
skilled aquatic sport (not water
ballet) which is judged the same
way as sports like ice skating,
gymnastics and diving‘ are. It is one
of the four recognized aquatic
sports’. the others being swimming,
diving and water polo.

The girls on the Pitt team have
made the University of Pittsburgh a

- well-known name in intercollegiate

competition throughout the U.S.
Last year Pitt ranked ﬁfth in the
Midwest Division in a field of 20

schools. Teams rankpedgbefore Pitt
were the varsity »teams at Ohio
State. University of Wisconsin,
University of Michigan and Michi-
gan State. At these schools. and
many more, synchronized swim-
ming is a women's varsity sport.
The sport was accepted into the
Association for Intercoilegiate Ath-
letics for Women last year and
hopes to hold its ﬁrst intercol-
legiate nationals at Michigan State
this year.

the line and, this year, he has been
moved to fullback. But the 5-10,
155-pounder doesn’t seem to mind.

“It’s a challenge moving aiound
the way I have. I've been so
offensively oriented all my life and
now I have the chance to play?
fullback and it’s fun.

“When you play fullback,”
Murphy continued, “you have to
think defensively all the time. You
might go on offense once in a,
while, but you still must be
conscious of your job on defense.
I’m always in the action and I like
it."

Being one of just a handful of
veterans, Murphy is a natural
choice for captain. As a co-captain
he takes his role seriously.

“As captain I have to teach and

lead at the same time,” he said.
“Sometimes. I have to act as
mediator between the coach and a
player. That’s a unique experience
for me and I enjoy it."

As for what he does when he
leaves Pitt next April, Murphy is
exploring different options.

‘‘If pro soccer paid more I would
probably give it a try, but as of
right now I don’t think I will,”
Murphy said. “Right now I am’
thinking of law school. I think I
would also like to coach a little. I
would enjoy working with players
and teaching them some of the
things I learned while I played.”

That is still a little off in the
future for Murphy, however. Right.
now he is concentrating on the
remainder of h-i:s— schedule.

“Like I  ‘fore we do have
some tough  , ‘s coming up but
we're getting better with every
game we play. Our younger guys
are becoming more and more
experienced and that can only
serve to help us.” i

Disdaining the‘ notionto look
very far into the future, Murphy is
setting his sights on the next few
weeks and the possible good things
they have in store for Pitt soccer.
He likes what he sees.

SYMPHONY CHARGED
IN ASSAULT SUIT

PITTSBURGH (AP)——A Con-
nellesville couple who say they were
attacked during a concert at Heinz
Hall here a year ago have ﬁled a
$50,000 suit against the Pittsburgh
Symphony Society.

Thomas Cole, 32, and n his wife
Rita, 32, said they were attending a
concert when they were beaten by
two men who had taken their seats
during the intermission.

The Society was named as
defendant since it owns and operates
the building.

The Coles charged that Heinz Hall
employes were negligent in refus-
ing to assist the couple while they
were ‘being beaten.

He was knocked unconscious

when one of the assailants hit him.

with a bottle. As a result of the
beating, Cole underwent brain
surgery and was hospitalized for
three weeks; ..._He is still partially
paralyzed in oiie leg.

  Undefeated Meet at Pitt Stadium

Panther fullback Elliott Walker, injured in a fall at preseason camp,
will get his first real test against the Temple Owls, who will invade Pitt
Stadium tomorrow afternoon. Walker has been used sparingly in Pitt's
first two outings.

BY STEVE SYBERT

With two impressive victories
already tucked, under their belts,
the Pitt Panthers, who now seem to
have the sky as their limit, will try
to make it three wins in a row when
the undefeated Temple Owls ﬂy
into Pitt Stadium at 1:30 p.m.
tomorrow.

After embarrassing Notre
Dame, 31-10, in South Bend and
traveling to the deep south to do
the same to Georgia Tech, 42-14,

Wilson photo

the Panthers now appear to be
headed into the November 26
matchup with Penn State at Three
Rivers Stadium with a 10-0 record.

The tables have turned from a
few years ago. Now, instead of Pitt
going into a game as the underdog.
they are now the favorite each time
they enter a stadium and oppo-
nents are now out to upset them.

It is a relatively new feeling at
Pitt and Coach Johnny Majors, who

is responsible for the turn-around,

thinks his team s success has not
gone to any of’ the players‘ heads.

“I like the way our team has
approached the season." Majors
said. “They haven't held any big
celebration parties after the wins
over Notre Dame and Georgia
Tech. And I haven't heard very
much talk about the rankings.
They're not too carried away with

9

themselves.’ _

Majors‘ only problem before last
Saturday was whether his team
would suffer a letdown after being
so high for the battle with the
Fighting Irish. Saturday night's
masterpiece in Atlanta proved that
wrong, yet the Panthers still came
away with another problem--‘the
loss of quarterback Robert Hay-
good for the season with a knee
injury.

So the Temple test will be,
essentially, the start of a second
season for Pitt, which is striving for
still a third campaign——a post-sea-
son bowl appearance. But the
Panthers will lose nothing with
Matt Cavanaugh at the helm. After
ﬁlling in for the injured Haygood in
the second quarter at Georgia
Tech, Cavanaugh passed for 117 in
seven completions to display the
new dimension he will undoubtedly
add to the Panthers’ offensive
attack.

Looking on the bright side,_with
Cavanaugh ably ﬁlling in for

Haygood. Pitt can now use such
sure-handed receivers as Jim
Corbett and Gordon Jones. where-
as beiore, the running of Tony
Dorsett and Elliott Walker were
more than enough to sustain the
offense.

Pitt ranks fourth in net punting and
ninth in scoring with averages of
45.1 and,3().5. respectively.
According to reports, fullback
Elliott Walker is nearing 100% and

will see the most action he has seen
so far this season when the

Tony Dorsett will continue his campaign for the Heisman Trophy

tomorrow against Temple, which has several outstanding runners of h‘
their own. A wide open, offensive game is expected for the near

I capacity crowd. .

You can't help feeling sorry for
the Temple Owls. Not only do they
own a seven-game winning streak
(second-longest in the country
currently) and no one seems to
care, but now their head coach says
he’s not concerned about his
team's contest with the third-
ranked Pitt Panthers.

“Nothing concerns me," said
Temple coach Wayne Hardin via
telephone hook-up at Tuesday’s
media luncheon. “They (the
Panthers) are a good football team
and they are in ‘the running for
number one in the country. But you
don't get concerned about them;
you just show up and play them and

see what happens."

in Philadelphia where the Panthers
trampled the Owls, 55-6. Temple
does possess ‘a good football
program. That is, compared to
most of its opponents, among them
Delaware, Dayton, Rhode Island,
Drake and Villanova. all victims in
the Owls’ current streak, along
with this season’s conquests,
Akron and Grambling.

But when Temple tries to tackle
bigger and better teams, they just
don't fair so well. Prior to their
annihitation at the hands of the
Panthers in 1975, the Owls were
stomped by West Virginia, 50-7.,
and downed by Boston College.
27-9_ But the team's best perfor-
mance of the season, though in a

decision for the Nittany Lions,
thanks to a 100-yard kickoff return
by Rich Mauti.

This year could be similar to 1975
for the Owls. They have an outside
chance for a credible 7-3 record yet
will be stomped on, most likely, by
three of their opponents, Pitt, West
Virginia and Penn State, while
breezing by the likes of Delaware,
Drake and Villanova.

Though he is not concerned with
Pitt, Hardin does have his share of
worries.

“Our offense is deﬁnitely better
than our defense overall." he said.
“I think it will be that way all year.
I’m just happy we’re 2-0 right-
now.” {Continued on Page

Switch to Defensive Back
Haygood’s Route to Pros

BY CRIS HALL

There was some good news and some bad news for Robert

Haygood on Monday. First the bad news—-his mangled left knee was
perhaps more mangled than was first believed. Torn ligaments had to
be repaired and a damaged cartilage had to be removed.

' The good news—the operation was successful and Haygood should
be ready to go in, say, about a year. Normally this would be bad news
and the end of a college career for Haygood, a senior. But for a variety
of reasons the injury could turn out to be not so bad a break after all.

Since Haygood participated in only two games before going down, he
is eligible for a one-year medical hardship extension of his NCAA
career. He has until the end of the year to apply for it, and chances are
he will. This will delay his departure from Pitt for a season, and also
will push his shot at the pros back a year.

That’s right, the pros. Haygood wants to go pro after he leaves Pitt.
He “has a deep desire to become a professional athlete,” according to
Pitt's sports information ofﬁce. That’s great. Haygood is
unquestionably an outstanding athlete and a young man who deserves
a shot at the pros. But—-—and it’s a pretty big but-he won't make it at
any position he presently is playing. That’s where the injury could,
well, help him. (Continued on Page 6)

game means ‘a lot to them. We're
about the biggest game on their

go a long way towards making their

“Temple has a lot of variations in

their offense. They try to catch you.

off balance. I don't want to call
them trick plays, but they'll catch
you sometimes if you're not
prepared.

“On offense, they line up pretty
much the same as we do."
Schroeder says. “They use the
veer. although they do throw the
ball a lot more than anyone else
we'll be playing."

Carey will be directing the attack
for the second year and has thus far
unleashed the ball 38 times,
completing 20 for 317 yards and
three touchdowns. According to
Schroeder, Carey “throws well,-
both long and short. '_ His speed is
probably average. It's definitely
not super speed."

Randy: An Individual

BY BOB EVANS

The victims of his never-ending
practical jokes—his “Sharon
games”--cal'l him names which
just cannot be printed. The Pitt
Panther Football Guide calls him
“...a very quiet and likeable guy.”
Rick Slager, the Notre Dame

‘quarterback who was tormented by

him an entire afternoon, calls out
his name in the middle of
nightmares. .

Now, given this list of such
consistent clues, it is elementary to
deduce the fellow described above
is none other than Randy Holloway
—-. philosopher, prankster, stu-
dent and football player.

“A lot of people want to know

you ‘cause you’re a player but

don’t care about you as a person,
which is more important to me, he
said. And" not too many players are

interested in that football stuff

after coming down“ the hill from
practice.”

A price must be paid to achieve
such notoriety, and Randy acknow-
ledges this more unpleasant side of
Pitt football.

V “College football can be very
violent. I guess most people might
notthink so, but practice can really
get crazy. It’s controlled violence,
not street violence, but there's lots

1 of flare-ups, too.’ ’

What's a “very quiet and
likeable guy” doing in such a
violent situation?

“Well, the rough stuff only lasts
so long, and then there's quite a bit
of fun in playing. So I just take the
bad with the good. _We just go out
and do the best we can.”

Week after’ week, Randy has
been able to give that best because,
both in high school and here at Pitt,
he has been fortunatg enough to

avoid injury. Yet, he knows the
‘hreat of injury is very real and is
tough not to think about.

I “I think about getting injured all
the time. I'm lucky, because ‘I
haven’t been hurt yet. Maybe I’m
overdue," he said witli.a laugh.
“When that kid fron1...Notre Dame
was dragged off the ﬁeld in the first
half, I wondered, ‘What's he going
through?’ I don't want to face that
pain."

Holloway was recruited as both a

defensive lineman and a tight end

RANDY HOLLOWAY

but was switched to fulltime
defensive duty early in his
freshman year.

“You’ve almost got to be a
maniac on defense," he said,
grinning. “You’ve got to hit
someone hard on every play. On
the offensive line, you can ﬁnesse

sometimes, but not on defense. But -

there’s a lot of satisfaction in
beating your manf’

Two weeks ago at South Bend.
hefound sweet satisfaction regu-
larly. Hollowav spent a great deal
of the game in the Irish backﬁeld
and disrupted their offensive flow.
For his tro_ubles, Holloway copped
defensive player of the game
honors.

“It's nice to get the recognition,
but put things where they’re due,"
he said. They were doubling on Al
Romano, and my guy was
inexperienced. But I always enjoy
beating a team of Notre Dame's
quality and tradition.”

Ara Parseghian, head coach at
Notre Dame ‘for 11 years, was the
color commentator for the nation-
ally televised game. Parseghian,
who had shown moderate interest
in Holloway at Sharon High,
probably was kicking himself for
not having recruited him more
intensively. And just why did
Holloway, an outstanding high
school basketball player, pick Pitt
and football?

“I didn't expect to be recruited
heavily in football, so I was going to
try both and Pitt had good
programs in both sports. But I was
so beat up and tired after football, I
forgot about basketball.”

Was Pitt a good choice?

“It was good for football and I

athletics, but football cuts into your

personal life here. Now all I want V

to do in my spare time is rest and
have a few beers.”

After sweating through his ﬁnal
practice, what lies ahead for Randy
Holloway

“Oh, maybe I'll go into
coaching. I’d like to impress on
kids some of the things I’ve been
through.

l|aygood’s Option: Switch

Now or Fight Pros Later  

\

( Continued from Page 2)

The chances Haygood has of making it as a throwing quarterback in
the NFL are slim. His forte is running, an activity most NFL coaches
prefer to leave to their running backs. At 6-0, 183, Haygood won’t’be
another Terry Bradshaw on the run. But there might be a place in
professional football for him—at defensive back.

Yeah, defensive back‘. Haygood could be a heck of a secondarv man.
He knows receivers’ routes and defensive backs and quarterbacks. He

is quick, smart and has good reactions and hands. Everything you
need, almost, to be a good defensive back.

It’s been done before. Ohio Sta_te’s Rex Kern (with Baltimore) and
Oklahoma’s Jack Mildren (with New England) both made the
secondary switch in the pros. _And they did it in the space of a
pre-season pro training camp, which is a couple of weeks long. Thanks
to the injury and the resulting layoff, Haygood could get a headstart at
the new position by spending his year at Pitt knocking passes down

rather than completing them. Should Bob decide to play out his -

redshirt option at Pitt, a lot of people, including himself, stand to gain.

Take Matt Cavanaugh. Matt will be a senior next year. Before
Haygood became a casualty in Atlanta, Cavanaugh was looking
forward to next year as his year. He was to be the quarterback, no
longer in the shadow of Haygood, who was really a shade ahead of
Cavanaugh in Johnny Majors’ game of musical quarterbacks.

With Haygood thinking about coming back for a fifth season,

‘ Cavanaugh must be wondering when he’ll be able to have a team of his

own. Cavanaugh will get a lot of experience during the remainder of
this season, and the team will become accustomed to having him call

the signals. So having him play quarterback will not be the .worst thing I

in the world for the Panthers by any means, and it will be the bestthing
in the world for Cavanaugh.

( Another plus from a Haygood switch to cornerback or safety would
be in defensive coordinator Bobby Roper’s secondary. Along with
assistant head coach Joe Madden, Roper would love to see Haygood
work out with the secondary come. next fall.

Another benefit from Haygo‘od’s standpoint is that pro scouts would .

have a whole year to watch him mature at defensive back, the position
for which he is he-st suited as a pro.

Hanhauser:  
Tackle with Taste

BY KAREN KADILAK

I Ever hear of a football player
who enjoys Philharmonic concerts,
building World War 11 models and
aquariums as much as he likes a
good downﬁeld block or open ﬁeld
tackle? '

Well, if you haven't or if you
have and still can’t imagine a big,
burly football player enjoying such
extracurricular activities, meet
John Hanhauser—an arts and
science lover, in addition to his role
as a Pitt offensive lineman. _

Believe it or not, Hanhauser
ﬁnds more to life than just X’s and
0’s and tackling dummies and it’s
this fact which explains why the
6-3, 255-pound tackle prefers an
evening at Heinz Hall (in the
off-season. Of c0|11'S€) t°v 53.3’!
viewing and reviewing the Pitt-
Penn State films a couple of dozen
times.

“Since Iwas young,” Hanhauser
explained while taping his ankles

-before a recent practice session at ‘

the training room in‘Pitt Stadium,
“I was always urged to become
involved in the arts.”

Nevertheless, love of arts or not,
there’s another passion in Han-
hauser’s life. Football, a love much
like the one he developed in his
days as a youth in Chicago, led to
his being selected for All-State’
consideration at Erie Cathedral
high school and Homewood Floos-
more high in Chicago before
coming to Pitt, where he is now
touted as an All America candi-
date. ‘

“I guess it’s just part of my

personality,” Hanhauser pointed ,

out. ‘ ‘Football has just been part of
my life. ’ ’ .

Could it possibly be that
Hanhauser loves football more than

‘ his other cultural pursuits? Just as

he philosophically discusses block-
ing for Tony Dorsett (“when Tony
runs to the opposite side, I’m going
to have to release the man in front
of me and do some downﬁeld
blocking”), he explains his varied
interests.

‘ ‘Both (football and culture) have
been imbedded within me since I
was vnung.” Hanhauser said. “I
always did enjoy football. As for
thearts,” Hanhauser continued, “I
was raised in Chicago before mv
family moved East and being so
close to the big city and all, we had
greater" proximity to museums and

“l’ve just been fortunate in
having great parents and their
giving me the opportunity to
combine both pursuits. As for
football, I'll have to give credit to
my two older brothers and my
uncle (Robert We-ber, a standout
linebacker for Penn State in the
pre-World War II days). They
really helped me become involved
in football."

His parents rarely miss a Pitt
home game and during the recent
Pitt-Notre Dame game a host of
Hanhauser’s relatives and friends
attended the game at South Bend.

“That's why I really chose Pitt,"
Hanhauser said. “because of its

‘proximity to Philadelphia and

Washington, D.C. Many of my
friends and relatives live there.
That plus the fact that Pittsburgh
has the big city atmosphere I like

Both Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors and offensive line coach
and offensive coordinator Joe
Avezzano agree Hanhauser’s fam-
ily background is greatly respon-
sible for the intelligence. aggres-
siveness and toughness Hanhauser

“I wish I had 80 o‘r‘85 other
players like him," Majors pointed
out. “He has considerable ability
and intelligence. Plus, he's plea-
sant to boot.”

Avezzano, famous for his mid-
week spaghetti dinners for his
offensive linemen. speaks in
generallv the same terms in
describing the articulate senior.

‘»‘He's level-headed," Avezzano
said. ‘.‘His family background has a
lot to do with that/. He's the kind of
guy llike. When he sees something
he doesn't think is right, he’ll
correct it by seeing me and asking
about the particular situation in an
intelligent manner.”
