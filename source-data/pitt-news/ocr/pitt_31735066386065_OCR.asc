City police believe that yesterday they
arrested a youth who has been committing
a series of rapes and burglaries in the South
Oakland area.

According to ‘ Commander Ronald
Freeman of the Pittsburgh Police
Investigations Office, a 16-year-old male
has been arrested and charged with the
rapes of two Pitt students and is being
investigated in connection with other rapes
in Oakland.

“We feel certain that we have the guy
who has committed most of the rapes,”
Freeman said. “We don’t know how many

we can attribute to him yet.”

A total of five rapes have been reported
in the area since July 8, according to Pitt
public-safety director William Brennan.

The suspect in custody is being charged
with the two most recent attacks, which
occurred on Aug. 16 and early yesterday
morning.

Brennan said that yesterday at
approximately 5:30 a.m., a male youth
climbed a fire escape to the third-ﬂoor
window of an Oakland Avenue apartment,
cut the window screen, entered and raped
the occupant.

“We’re trying to put all the information
we can together as quickly as possible,”
said Brennan before the arrest was made.

“I can tell you [the victim] is a student at the
University of Pittsburgh. The apartment
building was not owned by the university.”

The youth was described as black,
approximately 17 or 18 years old, with
large eyes and a block—shaped hair cut.

According to Freeman, the description
matched that of a youth previously picked
up prowling in the South Oakland area by
a joint city and Pitt police task force.

A yellow bicycle seen parked outside the
Oakland Avenue apartment during the time
of yesterday’s rape further linked the
suspect to the scene.

This was the fourth rape to match the
pattern of the attacker’s entering the victim’s
residence through an open window.

Another part of the pattern, according to

Freeman, is certain things that the attacker ’

said and did to the victims.

“We saw a pattern there, and we felt it is
this one guy doing these things,” Freeman
said. "

Brennan had been encouraging students
living off campus to take action to foil the
attacker or attackers’ pattern.

“Most importantly, I can’t stress this
enough —— now it’s warm out there, but the
general pattern [in the rapes] is the open

over dispute
with provost

By Jennifer Calabrese

A disagreement with Pitt
Provost Donald Henderson was
not the only reason that School of
Education Dean Thomas LaBelle
resigned this month.

“This is a situation where there
is a push and a pull factor. The
push factor is that I have been
offered an excellent position [as
vice president for academic affairs
and provost at Georgia State
University]. The lack of priority
and commitment that the central
administration is giving the School
of Education is the pull factor,”
said LaBelle. '

The conﬂict with Henderson
began in February, when LaBelle
estimated that about 25 of his
faculty members would be retiring
within five years. He then asked
Henderson to guarantee him that
at least half of those would be
replaced.

“We talked about this over some
time. He was not giving me any
definite answer,” LaBelle said.

Henderson said that the reason
that he was unable to guarantee
LaBelle the replacements is linked
to the ﬁnancial troubles that the

Rick Ozimok was the last person to shake President Wesley Posvar’s hand at the annual
freshman picnic yesterday.

Posvar meets
his last class

By Andrea Barczykowski
Staﬂ‘ Writer

When Pitt President Wesley Posvar shakes
hands with a long line of incoming students,

-it usually signifies a beginning. This year, it

marks the end of a Pitt tradition as the class
of ’94 will be the last to do so with Posvar.
Posvar said he is proud of the tradition of
greeting the new students. “This is the 24th
receiving line of freshmen. It's sort of old-
fashioned; very few schools do it. It’s very
important,” he said.
- Posvar has been shaking the hands of
new students at the annual freshman picnic

since 1965, but this year will be his last

because of his retirement at the end of this
academic year.

Freshman Rick Ozimok has the distinction
of not only being part of the last class, but

also being the last-recipient‘ of Posvar’s

freshman handshake.

“I didn’t even know I was the last. It was
an honor,” said Ozimok,‘who admitted he
had originally come just; for the food.

Not all the students just wanted a free
meal. Like many students, Kristin Nitowski
came “to meet the president and to associate
with my fellow freshmen.”

Although the stu dents wanted to meet the
president, many were not aware of the
president’s retirement.

“I didn’t know that it was his last year.
We’re really honored,” said freshmanjennifer
Mazzuca.

“I can’t guarantee something
like that to anyone. It is impossible

for me to make those kinds of
promises considering the ﬁnancial
constraints the university will be
under in the next few years,”
Henderson said.

LaBelle said that he thought
Henderson’s action may have
been prompted by a prior pattern
that former provosts began.

Students recall role in government ousting

Byjacinta Marie Dvorak
Sta_ﬂ‘ Wﬁter

Being a student in
Czechoslovakia in 1989 was
anything but boring.

The students in Czechoslovakia
were largely responsible for the
democratic revolution and the
destruction of the Communist
government.

Oto Markovic, a Slovak medical

student, describes the activities
of November 1989 as “amazing.”

“On Saturday, Nov. 18, I was at
home and heard that some
students in Prague had
demonstrated against the socialist
government and that they were
going to be beaten. 1 went back
to school on Monday, thinking
nothing of the incident,” said
Markovic.

But changes came quickly, and

one incident seemed to lead to
another. Some Slovak actors came
to Markovic’s medical school in
Martin, Czechoslovakia, and
talked about the possibility of a
revolution. “The actors talked to
every student, and then we
decided to strike like the students
in Prague. We were afraid,”
Markovic said.

Monday led into Tuesday, and
normal academic life seemed to

halt. The students’ first
revolutionary move was the
decision not to go to class. That
decision was met with great
resistance from the school’s
director.

The director told the students
that if they were going to strike,
they may as well just leave the
school.

“When the director left, we

One incoming freshman boy
had this to say, “I don’t think I
would take a class in the program
because as a history-oriented
student, I don’t feel women have
played many important roles in
history.”

Dr. Maurine Greenwald, a
history teacher involved with Pitt’s
Women’s Studies Program since
its creation in 1972,. disagrees.
Greenwald cites the persecution
of witches, controversy over birth
control and the feminization of
teaching as only a small portion
of women’s involvement in
history.

She teaches a course, U.S.
Women 1, that analyzes the
contributions of women‘ to the

' economy and the constraints they

faced as homemakers and wage
earners. The course also puts
special emphasis on women of
different races, classes and ethnic
groups. '8

Greenwald says

that any

student can always benefit from
a course in Women's Studies no
matter what their major. “The
Women’s Studies Program offers
a perspective of women from
several different disciplines’
points of view,” Greenwald said.

However, there are certain
majors where a certificate in the

Another major area explored.

in the program’s courses is gender
and the comparison of the sexes.
“It’s really important for men and

But while the number of
women in the program who will
receive certiﬁcates has doubled
in the past two years, the male
enrollment has remained
consistently low. McCallister feels
that there is a certain amount of
negative feelings among the males
on campus that keeps many
interested students away.

,Fresbmanwomen most prone to date rape

«fir

By Jenifer Crook
Senior Stajf Writer

This week, 1,247 freshman women will
launch their college careers at the University
of Pittsburgh. Many will choose to indulge
in the back—to-school partying life, taking
full advantage of their newfound freedom.

Yet, within the first months of school,
some of these young women may find that
their social fun has turned to tragedy.
They, along with 25 percent of college
women nationally, may become the victims
of date and acquaintance rapes.

“Data suggests that the most vulnerable
time for date and acquaintance rape is
during the freshman year between
orientation and Thanksgiving — the first
break,” said Robert Gallagher, director of
Pitt’s counseling center.

Sara is one of the faces behind these
statistics. An attractive, outwardly conﬁdent
21-year-old woman, the Pitt senior’s brown
eyes harbor a sadness which betrays her
ready smile. Only a few close friends know

why. Sara is a victim of date rape. very late, and not many people remained

however, when Sara realized that it was

The guy then became very forceful. “He

anyway, and then he just ran out of the

According to Gallagher, Sara’s
experience is far from uncommon among
Pitt students. In a survey of 600 Pitt
undergraduates conducted by the
Counseling and Student Development
Center last year, 21 percent of the women
said they were forced to have sexual
intercourse at some time in their lives. Of
those victims, 90 percent reported that
they personally knew their aggressor.

Rape prevention a myth, awareness a must, says PAAR

By Mike Ertl
Staﬂ“ Writer

There really is no such thing as
rape prevention, according to
Barbara Weiner, an education
specialist at Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape.

“We talk to women about
reducing the risk. We don’t
generally talk about prevention
because prevention implies that
the woman has that sort of power
to prevent it, and that’s not true,”
said Weiner. “Only the rapist can
prevent it.”

Pittsburgh Action Against Rape
is a local rape—crisis center located
at-3712 Forbes Ave. The agency,
which is operated by 23 regular

staff members and over 100
volunteers, provides counseling
and support services for victims
of sexual assault as well as offering
educational programs about rape.
According to a survey
conducted by Dr. Mary Koss of
the University of Arizona Medical
School, 15 percent of college
women surveyed reported that
they had been raped. The survey,
which appeared in the September
edition of Glamour, was
conducted from 1984 to 1985 and
involved 6,159 male and female
students at 32 U.S. colleges.
Although women may not be
able to protect themselves entirely
from being raped, Weiner said
they can take precautions to

public.

Crime Watch Seminar:

The University of Pittsburghwill hold a Crime
Watch Seminar on Thursday, August 30, at
6:30 p.m., to discuss the‘ recent series of
rapes in the area, and to inform students,
faculty, staff and general public, on how to
best ensure their personal safety in the fu-
ture. The seminar, sponsored by the De-
partment of Public Safety, will be held at the
William Vitt Union Assembly Room, 3959
Fifth Avenue. It is open and free to the

apartment on Ward Street. The
attacker, who was described as a
white male, approximately 19 or
20 years old with short brown
hair, beat the victim with a
hammer. .

It was the severity of this attack,
along with the victim’s description
which was different from those of
the two previous rape victims,
that led Brennan to theorize that
there was more than one rapist.
He said, however, that he
wouldn’t rule out the possibility
of a single rapist.

“My feeling is that when there's
a lot of press and media coverage
about something like this, you
may in fact evoke those kinds of
actions in others who've always

had the capability of committing
such a crime,” said Brennan.
Freeman said that city police
have physical evidence, including
the hammer used, to link the
suspect with the Aug. 16 attack.
He said different descriptions
were probably due to the
emotional state of the victims.
Officer John Cousins, the
commander’s clerk at the zone-
six city—police station in Squirrel
Hill, reported that there has been
a total of 10 rapes or attempted
rapes in the entire zone—six patrol
area since June, with seven of
these incidents occurring in July
alone. Zone six includes Oakland,
Squirrel Hill and Shadyside.
Cousins described the number of
rapesias more than usual.

Weiner advised women to travel
in groups and to tell someone
where they are going and when
they will be back.

According to officials at the
University Department of Public
Safety, students must take
common-sense precautions such
as locking doors and windows.

“College students have to take
responsibility for safety upon
themselves,” said police officer

Karen McKee Jones, “and a lot ol 1

According to Sgt. Charles Grier,

Managing Editor

Though experts are certain of the devastating
psychological effects suffered by rape victims they are still
unsure of the psychological motivation of rapists.

While some psychologists and other experts say that
violence motivates rapists, others argue that rape is a
sexually motivated crime.

“It’s both,” according to Detective Earl L. Johnson of the
Sex Assault Squad of the Pittsburgh Zone 6 Police.

“The motivating force behind a rape could be sexual and
it could be violent,” he said.

“I don’t think that anyone who could call [
authority would tell you that it’s either/or,” he said.

City Police Chief Mayer DeRoy
described the number of rapes as
a substantial increase over the
usual number, but that he was
more concerned with preventing
new rapes from occurring, rather
than dwelling on the ones that
had already occurred.

“[The South Oakland cases]
were all cases involving windows
that were left open,” he said. “We
want the young girls [moving into
Oakland in the fall] who come
from small towns where these
things don’t happen as much to
be safe.”

According to detective James
McCarthy of the city sex-assault
squad, it is standard to have aboul

“We make recommendations,”
said Jones. “The problem is even

Grier said Pitt students often

such as nighttime shuttle and taxi

These services are provided free

to students by the Department of

In the event that a rape occurs,
both Weiner and campus police
officials agree that the most

do is seek immediate medical
attention.

adding that they also need to be

Motivation for sexual assualt an/enown

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Silvija Singh, a staff psychologist with the university’s
Counseling and Student Development Center, said that
violence prompts a rapist to commit rape.

“It’s a violent act, not a sexual one. It’s a violent act that’s
acted out in a sexual way,” she said.»

“You probably wouldn’t have 100-percent agreement,
but I think that’s the way it’s generally viewed,” she said.

Dr. Robert Gallagher, also with the Counseling and

Student Development Center, said that the motivation for

rape is linked to the rapist’s background.

“Many rapists are men who grew up subscriblingl to the
more traditional roles of males [and] think that aggression
is natural -and healthy among males. They think that
women appreciate it -— that they want aggression and
look for it in a man,” he said.

Juicy, sweet, red watermelons helped to lure both

Fair shows
activities
available
at Pitt

By Andrea Barczykowski
Sta_,0“ Writer

A first—time student at Pitt could
get lost in the crowd at such a
large university.

To make freshmen aware of
the many extra—curricular
opportunities that are available
within the university, the student-
activities department held an
activities fair in Forbes Quad
yesterday. Representatives from
130 student groups were available
to give information about their
organizations to interested
students.

Besides the usual flyers and
pamphlets, organizations handed
out a variety of food and supplies.
Groups attracted students by
offering things from cotton candy
to sticks of deodorant.

Although many students may
sign up for these groups, the
representatives realize that the
students are not obligated to keep
with them.

According to Julie Rollins, vice
president of the Western
European Cultures Club, only half
the" students who sign up will
probably attend the first meeting.

“They [sign u pl because they’re
excited about meeting new
people. When we call them back,

. only about 50 percent are

interested,” she said.

But the fair is still an opportunity
to recruit members for the
organizations.

Cyndy Maganotti, president of
the Panther Investment Club,
understands that students are not
always sure where their interests
lie.

“There’s so many things, they
don’t know what they want to do.
But we’re still going to get a lot of
people at our first meeting from
this fair,” she said.

For most students, this is the
best way to find out what
organizations exist.

“I knew what I had in mind, but

I wasn’t sure if they offered [grou ps
pertaining to my interests] at Pitt,”
said freshman Stephanie Zweig.

Other students didn’t have I

anything particular in mind but
were looking for something new

“I didn’t know what I was

interested in, so I wanted to know '

what was out there,” said
freshman Gina Haun.
Whether the students had a
particular interest or were looking
for one, the Activities Fair helped

freshmen find their place at Pitt.

in being part of this tradition, after knowing that it was the last
for Posvar.

“It’s nice to be one of the last freshmen to shake his hand. It's
kind of exciting," student Radhika Kakaria said.

Because of the size of Pitt, most students saw this as their
only opportunity to meet the president.

“It’s such a large university, I didn’t think I’d ever get to meet
him,” said Cheryl Mickey.

According to Diane Saylor, program coordinator for the office
of special events, approximately 2,000 of the 3,300 invited
freshmen attended the picnic along with 200 faculty and staff
members, mentors and resident assistants.

Besides the president, students were also greeted by Mrs.
Posvar, Student Government President Julie Shepard and Vice
President of Student Activities William Harmon.

“Even if they didn’t meet me, they had a chance,” Posvar said.

agreed to strike without his
consent,” said Markovic.

The strike began in Martin on
Tuesday, Nov. 21, according to
Markovic.

“We formed a strike committee,
and we went into town and called
people to strike. We posted signs
and proposed resolutions. Later,
we organized meetings to tell
people why we had decided to
strike,” Markovic said.

Tomas Markovic, Oto’s
younger brother, decided to bring
revolutionary activities to his high
school. “Some students prepared
short revolutionary speeches that
were heard throughout the
school. I was one of those
students," he said.

The striking students suddenly
were faced with a great deal of
problems. “The police were
arresting us. It was very dangerous
[...] and scary,” said Markovic.

Later on, the police decided to
further the students’ cause,
Markovic said. “During the second
week of the revolution, the
policemen began to help us. The
policemen wanted the symbol of
the revolution to wear.”

Soon after the revolution began,
the policemen were wearing the
revolutionary colors: blue, red
and white. The strikes were not
contained to one part of the
country. “We had a link with
Bratislava and Prague. We all
agreed on what to do next,” said
Markovic.

Less than a week after the
school strike began, there was a
general strike against the
Communist government.
Everyone from doctors to bakery
workers went on strike.

“Everyone was in the street with
ﬂags and signs protesting. Cars
were stopped in the streets, and
people were honking their horns.
The police helped us by stopping
cars and striking. The military was
isolating us. They didn’t know
what to do," said Markovic.

About 10 days into the
revolution, the first change in
government took place. Some
Communist Party members were
immediately removed. But most
government officials were still
Communist Party members who
had just renounced their
membership in the party and
claimed to be democratic
supporters.

“We didn’t agree with letting
the communists in the
government,” Markovic said. “We
continued to strike. After a week,
the government changed again,
but we didn’t have a president.
We were going to strike until there
was a president that we could
agree on.”

On Dec. 29, President Vaklav
Havel was officially elected. “Our
strikes had ended, but we were
prepared to strike again until there
were free elections.” Free
elections took place on June 8
and 9 of 1990. Ninety-six percent
of the citizens of the republic of
Slovakia participated in these free
elections.

The striking did lead to the
desired goal of democracy, but
other problems arose. Many
students had missed class because
of the strikes and had a lot of
work to make up.

B100 vs. olbjecz‘ of CM U defense Ccmtmetprotesz‘

 _ -  By Dominic Romeo
 l‘ ’  Stag‘ Writer

   

Carnegie Mellon University’s contract with the Department of Defense
came under ﬁre again yesterday at a rally organized by Pittsburgh
activist Vince Eirene. \

“The struggle continues that voung minds not be drafted into the
works of war,” said Eirene to a group of students attending the first day
of classes. -

The demonstration occurred in the wake of the crisis in the Middle
East, with Eirene and CMU students voicing their opinions about US.
intervention there.

Wail Qattan, a Palestinian student at CMU who lived in Kuwait for
13 Vears, still believes in a solution to the Arab crisis.

Qattan feels that US. intervention is not concerned with the people
of the Middle East. “The interests of the United States are only to make
monev," he said. ,

“lf people are going to be killed, it should not be for oil,” said Eirene.

Carnegie Science Center to open in 1991

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

One of the next additions to the
Pittsburgh skyline will be the $57
million Carnegie Science Center,
scheduled to open in the fall of
1991.

The Center’s 40,000 square feet
of exhibit galleries, which will
provide four times as much space
as the present Buhl Science Center
building, will house a gallery of
the country’s top exhibits,
interactive discovery and pre-
school learning areas, a “Science
Spectacular” arena and a major
theme exhibit.

Education is the main mission,
according to Alphonse DeSena,
director of the Carnegie Science
Center.

DeSena stressed the need to
support science education in

regional school systems to combat
the “distressing decline of interest
in the sciences among our young
people.”

The Carnegie Science Center
will be built along the Ohio River
near Three Rivers Stadium.

The 312—foot USS Requin, a
decommissioned World War II
navy submarine, will float
permanently in the Ohio next to
the science center. Visitors will
be able to tour its interior.

The Carnegie Science Center
will feature an Omnimax theater,
71 feet in diameter with 350 seats.
In the Omnimax, the Carnegie
will show films that simulate
motion, such as diving
underwater, plummeting off a
cliff, ﬂoating weightless in outer
space or skimming over ﬁelds in
a low-flying plane. H

The effect is achieved by

projecting 70 mm film with a 180-
degree lens to fill most of a domed
screen. The screen curves beyond
the viewer’s peripheral vision as

he or she sits on steeply tiered
seats which are tilted at a 30-
degree angle to maximize the

effect.

To acquire the films that will be
shown in the Omnimax theater,
The Carnegie joined the Museum
Film Network consortium, an
international group of science
centers dedicated to producing
high-quality educational ﬁlms.

Joining the consortium is more
economical than renting films,
according to DeSena.

“By joining the network, we
have allied ourselves with
institutions with similar goals,” he
said.

Bu/9] Cilj/'5 science mecca

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

When The Carnegie Science Center opens in 1991, Buhl
Science Center will become an educational annex for classes
and other science programs.

On Oct. 12, 1939, Buhl Planetarium and Instituteof Popular
Science, as it was called then, was opened.

The planetarium was founded by the Buhl Foundation in
memory of mercantile millionaire Henry Buh1_]r., a Pittsburgh
philanthropist who acquired his fortune as co-owner of Boggs
and Buhl Department Store. The store was located in what is
now Allegheny Center Mall, where Buhl Science Center now
stands.

Many of Buhl Science Center’-s original programs, such as the
Science Fair, the Foreign Language Festival and the holiday sky
show, “Star of Bethlehem,” are still held annually.

Buhl was the fifth planetarium in the United States to house a
Model II Zeiss Star Projector 4- the only one still in use today.
Buh1’s rooftop siderostat telescope is still the country's only
such telescope open to the public.

The Carnegie Science Center
will also house a planetarium for

The Henry Buhljr. Planetarium
will be a 150—seat audiovisual
environmental theater where
visitors explore the universe via
state-of—the—art equipment, which
includes an audience—response
system. Hand-held response units
will allow participants to feed
signals into the central computer
for fully active audience
participation.

The new planetarium will be
capable of simulating a realistic
three-dimensional ﬂight through
space. The “Digistar,” an elaborate
graphics planetarium projector,
will accurately recreate seasonal
skies, the sun, the moon, stars
and planets.

The planetarium willbe able to
simulate a three-dimensional
ﬂight through space and to
dimensionally rotate images, such
as the brain or a DNA helix, for
‘scientific study.

The Digistar system, created by
Evans and Sutherland Computer
Corp., is also a scientific data bank
with astronomical details on 9,000
visible stars.

The planetarium will have a
dome 50 feet in diameter and will
contain 150 reclining seats and a

are never reported,” said
Gallagher, who cited an Auburn
University survey of 600 date—rape
victims, of which only four had
admitted the crime to police.

“’Ihere’s a lot of confusion there.
Sometimes the women can’t
believe this happened; they aren’t
always sure if it was rape.
Sometimes they’ll even go out
with the guy again because he
seemed like such a nice person
and they can’t believe he’d do
that.”

Often date rapes go unreported

-11

because the victims often feel
guilty and blame themselves,
Gallagher explained.

“The guilt in date rape is usually
more than in rape by a stranger.
Victims say to themselves, ‘I knew
the possibility existed, and yet I
let myself get into that position.”

In order to deal with the guilt,
Gallagher recommends that date-
rape victims confide in someone,
such as a trusted friend.

“It’s usually best to first go to a
friend or counselor if necessary.
They can help the victim sort out
the experience and decide on

other involved issues, such as if
the victim should tell her family.”
Gallagher said that Pitt’s
counseling center helps several
rape victims each year. “Many of
them are juniors and seniors who
were raped as freshmen and never
really dealt with it. A person can
be very upset for a long time ifshe
doesn’t deal with the tragedy.”

More often than not, said
Gallagher, date rape is linked to
alcohol abuse. “People’s
inhibitions and defenses are
down. Aggressors are more likely

to act if they have been drinking.”

Many people believe that it is
not a rape if a woman does not
physically fight her aggressor. This
is not the case, according to
Gallagher.

“If a woman says no, and the
man persists, he is being
inappropriate. Often when a man
is forceful, a woman feels trapped
and doesn’t know how to stop it,
so she lets it happen. It’s still rape.

“Men have to learn that they
don’t have to beat someone to be

a rapist” In fact, a national survey
conducted by Ms. magazine
revealed that one in every 12 men
admits to committing acts that
could be defined as rape.‘

Although the tragedy of date
rape remains highly unreported,
Gallagher credits the media and
other sources with giving the issue
increased publicity. “A lot more
victims are speaking up and
realizing that being raped was
not their fault. That’s a start, but
there’s still a long way to go with
prevention. ”

Pitt's disabled students struggle, but help is available A

By Pat N aughton Hoffman
Staﬂ‘ Wmer

In March of this year, automatic doors
were installed in Forbes Quadrangle to
assist wheelchair-bound students at Pitt,
and handicapped-entrance signs were
placed outside the Thaw Hall and Space
Research buildings.

But sometimes these doors are locked,

, which necessitates-travel up a steep grade

to reach Forbes Quad’s other entrance.
Depending upon the particular handicap
of the student, access to this entrance can
be very difficult.

Student Services specialist Sabina Bilder
said that there are 240 disabled persons at
Pitt. Most are students, but a few are
faculty and staff members. .

After graduation, Murdy visited Pitt and around Oakland by wheelchair. He was

deciding factor, Murdy said.

Although Murdy’s family lives close to
Pitt, he resided in Tower C during the
winter term of his freshman year. “People
on my floor are really cool. All I have to do
"is ask, and they will assist me,” said Murdy.

In the classroom Murdy uses a computer
called VersaBraille. Braille is made up of
combinations of six dots. The computer
has two levels of operation. The lower
section, consisting of six keys, functions
as the keyboard for the blind student. As
he taps the keys, a disk stores the
information.

The upper level, 20 tiny rectangular
combinations of six dots, is used when the
student is “reading” the information. Murdy
says that it helps him with notes and
assignments. It also has a spell-checker.

“lll don’t know what I would do without
it,” said Murdy, who has used it for the past
five years.

For the blind student, math can be
difficult. “Algebra is my roughest class; the
rest aren’t so bad," said Murdy. “lMy math
teacher] understands a lot of the problems
that I have. [He said], ‘As long as I know
you are trying, you won’t fail this class.”’

Another area Murdy has trouble with is
essay exams: He is working with the
Learning Skills Center to reduce his test

anxiety. .

Murdy said that students around campus
are generally pretty helpful.

“Getting around here is not easy——— [it’s al
matter of doing it and doing it,” said Murdy.
“If I need direction or something, people
are willing to help.”

sponsored agency, has worked with him

After school, McGlynn wants to join the
Peace Corps and work in Haiti. She is also
considering medical school.

Dyslexics often have trouble organizing
thoughts or writing things down by hand.

“I never know what to say when people
ask me about dyslexia,” said McGlynn. “I

how everything looks for me. Printed

on his class—schedule routine. Murdy and
his instructor are also working on street
crossings and bus travel.

The agency's main emphasis is on
assisting visually impaired students in any
way necessary, according to Murdy. For
Murdy, that assistance extends to funding
part of his education. Murdy received
$5,200 in financial aid from BVS last year.

Murdy attributes his achievements to a
family that has been a “neverending source

of support for me. I wrestled for school, ’

and they were really behind me. I learned
from wrestling to tough it out,” said Murdy.

Although Murdy’s disability is easily
recognizable to fellow students and
teachers, Erin McGlynn’s is not. In the
third grade, McGlynn was diagnosed as
having severe dyslexia. She is one of 40
known dyslexic students at Pitt.

Dyslexia is the most prevalent learning
disability among Pitt students, according
to Bilder. With dyslexia, the processing of
information does not take place from
beginning to end, said Bilder. _

' As a senior anthropology major, McGlynn
could have graduated last year. Instead
she switched her major to biology. She

material moves on the page; it's like seeing
waves.”

These problems make reading extremely
difficult for dyslexics.

“[I] am a very slow reader; I get all of my
tapes from Sabina. I see the context of a
sentence more like a symbol. If one letter
is off, I don’t see the difference,” said
McGlynn. For example, McGlynn would
write the word “bad,” but would read it as
“badly” because she cannot see the
difference.

Word processors make writing papers
much easier for dyslexics. Illegible writing
and spelling errors are nearly erased with
the use of computers, according to
McGlynn. Bilder adds that the use of a
word processor helps to reduce some of
the frustration dyslexics experience with
common mistakes which can be edited or
spell-checked.

When McGlynn started college, she did
not solicit help from the Disabled Student
Services, and her grades suffered. She heard
about the service from her father, who is a
faculty member at Pitt.

“Sabina’s been great,” said McGlynn, who
receives tapes of her texts and takes her

tests at the Disabled Student Services office.
“The more I relied on [Disabled Student
Services], the better my grades got. The

first semester after I used them, I made the “V-

dean’s list.”

Bilder sends a form letter to each disabled
student’s classes, and those students are
asked to introduce themselves on the first
day of class.

“Teachers try to be understanding,” said
McGlynn. Sometimes, however, she said,

the fact that she isn’t easily recognized as -

being handicapped can be a burden. Once
a professor said to her, “You don’t look
disabled.”

“I felt like saying, ‘I left my drool bucket
at home,’” said McGlynn. “People are a lot
harder on me [because I] look like everyone
else. They are less careful about what they
say to me.”

Another time, a sociology professor told
her to her face that he didn’t “believe in

teachers, but I seem to remember better
those they should stay away from,” said
Bilder.

-McGlynn recalled another time when a
literature professor told her that she could
not be in the class because the professor
“did not have extra time to devote to a.

student who was not normal.”
Even worse, in McGlynn’s opinion,~is
how paranoid professors get when Bilder

wheelchairs, and 16 use braces, canes or
crutches, according to Bilder.

Sestili has been attending Pitt part time
since 1983. “I lived in the dorms for two
semesters, and that was a mistake,” said
Sestili, who claimed he fooled around too
much and his studies suffered.

“Getting around in my bedroom in Tower
C was really tough because the room was
so small,” said Sestili.

When asked if the Disabled Student
Services office helped him, he emphatically
answered, “Yes.”

Sestili, like McGlynn, did not take
advantage of the service immediately.

Sestili has reciprocated the help he
received from Disabled Student Services
by working for Bilder during the past two
summers. He went around campus and
looked at every building to see what
improvements could be made for
handicapped students.

One of his suggestions was the
installment of the automatic doors in Forbes
Quad.

“Nice change,” said Sestili about the
automatic doors.

Another change Sestili would like to see
is improved lighting in the Cathedral of
Learning. He's also had difficulty getting

Withholding is abetting...

A woman was raped in her apartment on Oakland
Avenue yesterday. She is the fifth rape victim in the
Oakland area since July 8.

According to public safety director Bill Brennan, in four
of the rapes, the rapist entered the victims’ apartments
through open first-ﬂoor windows. Because of this pattern,

two or more of the rapes.

One of these women was beaten in the face with a
hammer so severely that homicide detectives were initially
called to investigate.

Freedom — use it or lose it  

Freedom of speech. As stated owners throughout Florida. So much emphasis has been

Since Aug. 15, Pitt’s public—safety department has been
distributing around campus an alert and two composite
sketches of one suspect. They are also offering free safety
surveys of student apartments and a seminar to tell students
about the rapes and how to prevent future occurrences.

Unfortunately, this action came too late for the two
women who were raped between July 8 and Aug. 15. "In
failing to warn the women on the Pitt campus immediately,

the department of public safety was grossly negligent.

While Brennan tried to justify the delay by saying that the
public-safety department needed time to develop a
composite of the rapist, there is no justification for
withholding from the public information that sexual assaults

did in fact occur.

Brennan said that women can take certain precautions
against rape, including closing and locking windows and

doors.

But had women been aware that rapes were occurring
in Oakland, they would have been even more cautious

about their safety.

'The public-safety department has a responsibility to
protect the students of the University of Pittsburgh. This
‘ responsibility includes informing students of the crimes
committed in the Oakland area so that they can help

protect themselves.

Rape itself is a horrible and despicable crime. Rape that
could have been prevented is exponentially worse.

in the Constitution, it’s supposed
to be one of our inalienable rights
as citizens of the United States. It
would seem clear-cut and easy to
understand; we may speak our
minds.

Unfortunately, numerous
politicians, religious leaders and
“concerned citizens” have taken
it upon themselves to decide what
is admissible for us to view,‘hear
and read.

Censorship in various forms has
taken place for centuries; so
public outcry over “obscene
material” is nothing new, but
when artists, writers and even
store owners are arrested for
disseminating this material,
something has gone awry.

What makes the situation even
more frustrating is the
inconsistency with which the

“obscenity” issue is dealtx“

Different areas harbor different
attitudes. What is perfectly
acceptable in one city may be
deemed lewd and indecent in
another.

Judas Priest has been sued for
the suicide of two Arizona
teenagers whose parents believe
that back-masked messages in the
group’s _ music were to blame.
Bobby Brown was arrested in
Columbus, Ga., in January 1989,
for “dancing suggestively.” Store
owners around the country have
been arrested and fined for selling
“obscene “ albums. K

Most recently and most
publicized was the arrest of 2 Live
Crewin Florida for their “obscene”
performance. Their album As
Nastyas They Wanna Be has been
cast aside like the plague by store

Closer to home, there was placed on the definition of

controversy over the exhibition
of the late Robert Mapplethorpe’s
work in Cincinnati this April.
With the help of Pennsylvania
State Senator Ron Gamble and
the Parents’ Music Resource
Center, most record companies
now “voluntarily” label any album
that contains lyrics dealing with
sex, drugs or violence in any form.

 

Tim
Azinger

Many albums are only to be sold
to persons over the age of 18.

These and hundreds of other
events have caused the Big
Brother of Orwell’s fantasy to
become a realistic nightmare. No
longer are unpopular thoughts
and expressions simply frowned
upon; they are now punishable
under the “law.” As rapper Ice-T
says, “Freedom of speech. Just
watch what you say.”

The individuals who have so
diligently taken it upon
themselves to protect us from the
evils of obscenity have forgotten
that each of us is a free—thinking
individual, able to make rational
decisions. '

“obscene” and what material fits
this deﬁnition that lawmakers
have failed to realize one very
important point: It doesn’t matter!
Everyone should be allowed to
express hirn/herself, and it is up
to each individual to decide for
him/herself what is obscene. So
not only are these censorship
efforts unconstitutional, they're

also insulting. These censorship
hounds believe that we can’t make
decisions for ourselves — how
degrading! .

Obscenity is a person-speciﬁc
concept, not an easily definable

truism. Censorship alone is absurd A

and even more so without a
standard by which to judge it. If
you can’t ﬁnd a standard deﬁnition
for obscene, then the solution to
censorship is simple: There
should be none!

Regardless of the subject matter,
the “obscenity” isn’t being forced
on anyone. We have the right to
listen, read or View anything we
want, just as we have the right to
ignore it; it’s that simple.

There are so many injustices in
this world that making a national
event out of every ﬂash of skin or
four-letter expletive that hits the
market is insensitive and foolish.
These energies could serve much
more useful purposes.

To all pro—censorship groups I
say “Fuck Off,” just because it’s
my right!

Bush on July 26. According to Bilder, this

act will have a profound positive impact

on the future for the disabled.
New buildings with more than two

stories must have elevators, and new
buses must have life equipment for

wheelchairs, according to the new
legislation.

Bilder has a “wish list,” and at the
end of each year she usually gets
some new equipment. In 1989,
she got three Braille ‘n Speak
machines. Information is entered
on a Braille keyboard, and the
machine speaks out loud what is

Sestili, although not enrolled in classes
this past winter term, started working five
months ago as a data-entry operator for
the life-histories department at Pitt. He got
the job through the Vocation Rehabilitation
Center.

There are 18 hearing-impaired students
at Pitt. Nine need sign-language
interpreters, while the others can read lips
and usually only need note takers.

There are also 33 other disabled students,
including those with heart/lung problems,
diabetes, psychiatric disorders and those
on dialysis.

Bilder’s interest in helping the disabled
began when she was intrigued by sign

Team concept: no names

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

You students out there may
have one more subject to study in
the fall.

But this one may be slightly
more enjoyable than history,
economics, biology, behavioral
neuroscience or whatever it is that
floats your boat.

When the Panthers take to the
field this year, there will be one
slight change in their appearance.

Head coach Paul Hackett has

‘ stressed the “no star” concept
since he took the helm last year.
Everyone is expected to
contribute in whatever role he
plays. And for that reason, Hackett
has decided to remove the players’
names from the jerseys, leaving a

- sea of numbers on the field and

- along the sidelines.

So get down to business and
start studying those rosters, Pitt
fans.

“We are going to emphasize
and talk about 15 or 18 starters.
We’re going to play the best
people for the situation, whoever
they are,” Hackett said.

“The concept that John
Robinson had at USC is probably
the place where I get that [idea].
When you run on that field and
see that Trojan maroon and gold,
you know who that is. You don’t
need to put someone’s name on
the back. And I think that the ‘Pitt’
on the ' helmet to me is so
distinctive, that to me is what we
are. We’re going to be a no—star
operation.”

Hackett plans to install a
multiple~substitution system this
season, which may have players

running on and off the field so
quickly that fans may not have
enough time to ﬂip through their
programs to see who is actually
playing.

Add to that the depth at certain
positions this season, and you
have a formula for numbers that
may confuse even the most adept
calculus professors.

Take the tight-end position, for
example. Lionel Sykes, Eric
Seaman and Dave Moore are all
likely candidates for the starting
job. Sykes is an excellent pass
catcher, Seaman an excellent
blocker and Moore is an able third
on the depth chart, which
occasionally means nothing,
notably in this scenario.

In the offensive scheme, tight
ends will play a key role. And in
keeping with his plan of playing
the best player for the situation,
Hackett may choose to play one,
two or all three tight ends on any
down. .

“Last year, [many times] we used
two tight ends, and then we went
to three tight ends, [a strategy]
which we actually stole from Joe
Walton when he was with the

Jets. We probably won’t go
without any tight ends very much.
We’ll have at least one, many times
two, and a lot of times three at any
given point,” Hackett said.

The secondary shuffle will
contribute to some numeric
confusion also. With many
inexperienced cornerbacks -
Marcus Washington, Steve Israel,
Dave Coleman and Vernon Lewis
to name _a few »— all may see
playing time.

This may mean increased sales

a Buffalo, Miami to battle for top spot in AFC East

"to Edttor’5 note: The following is

the first of a three-part series
analyzz'ngtbeAmen'canFootball
Conference. The AFC‘ Central
follows tomorrow, and the AFC
West will be in Monday’s paper

A strong case could be made
that the AFC East is the worst
division in the NFL. It is a case that

1 is likely to be proven throughout

the course of the season. The New
England Patriots and New York
Jets have new head coaches and
are beginning to rebuild. The
Indianapolis Colts are struggling
to establish front-office legitimacy,
let alone trying to ﬁeld a winning
team. The Buffalo Bills and Miami
Dolphins will battle it out for the

" division title, with the loser hoping

for a wild—card playoff spot.

0 Buffalo Bills—The Bills are
easily the most talented team in
the division, boasting marquee
players like Jim Kelly, Andre Reed,
Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith,

’ Cornelius Bennett and Shane
Conlan. However, they must

‘Questablish a better team attitude

and cease the pointless bickering

in order to achieve their potential.
A dispute between two assistant
coaches even came to blows last
season.

Quarterback Jim Kelly signed a
seven—year, $20 million contract
extension in the off-season. The
raise may be an incentive for Kelly
to shut his mouth and quit
criticizing players in the media as
well as to improve his play. While
Kelly's comments did not help
the Bills last year, his play certainly
did. He tossed 25 TD passes,
despite missing 3 games. Kelly
also has developed a better feel
for the short and intermediate
passing games, as he completed
58.3 percent. A return to form by
veteran wide receiver James
Lofton or the emergence of
Speedster Don Beebe could see
the Bills going deep more often in
1990.

Buffalo’s main offensive
weapons are running back
Thurman Thomas and WR Andre
Reed. Thomas has become one of
the top rushing-receiving threats
in football. For someone his size,
he also possesses an ' uncanny

ability to break tackles CS’10", 198
lbs). Reed led all AFC receivers
last year with 88 receptions. While
he is not the ﬂashiest receiver in
football, he does what a receiver
is supposed to do —- get open anc
catch the ball. Few do it better
than Reed, and he is very
dangerous after the catch. Watch

Michael
Milliron

out for rookie fullback Carwell
Gardner, a second—round pick out
of Louisville. He has good all-
around skills that have been
likened to Alonzo Highsmith’s.
He is capable of having the kind
of rookie year that Ickey Woods
had in 1988 for the Bengals.
The key to the Buffalo defense
returning to its ’88 form lies with
DB Bruce Smith and OLB
Cornelius Bennett. Smith was
nagged by injuries last year. It is

now time for Bennett to start
playing like Lawrence Taylor
instead of being compared to
Lawrence Taylor. If these guys
can put heat on the passer, the
Bills will do well defensively. A
division title is within reach for
Buffalo in 1990, and they are
capable of making some noise in
the playoffs. A
0 Miami Dolphins — Amid

trade rumors and reports that he
is unhappy, Dan Marino will lead

the Miami Dolphins into the 1990‘

season. He has endured two, not
sub—par, but sub—Marino, seasons
and is feeling some frustration
over the team’s lack of success.
Marino still possesses the quickest
release in the league, although he
is sometimes rattled and loses
concentration if he is hit. Marino
is, at times, reluctant to wait for
receivers to get open and will
force the ball, which leads to
interceptions. Despite some
shortcomings, he is still one of the
best quarterbacks in football
today.

Ever since the “Killer B’s” were
exterminated in the mid—1980s,

the Dolphins have always been
looking to improve their defense.
They finished 24th in the league
last year, but some help has
arrived. CB Tim McKyer was
acquired from the 49ers on draft
day. He should vastly improve a
talented, but young secondary
that includes hard-hitting safeties
Louis Oliver and Jarvis Williams.
The defensive line is easily tossed
around by opposing offensive
lines. This problem hampers the
play of a relatively good group of
linebackers. John Offerdahl and
Hugh Green have to fight through
too many blockers to get to the
ball carrier.

Sammie Smith was drafted last
year to improve the running game
and give the Dolphin offense more
balance. While he struggled early
with injuries, he came on strong
towards the end of the season.

Smith will take some pressure off .

Marino this Year. The offensive
line needs to improve. They need
to give Marino more time so he
can hit his receivers deeper down
field and go for more big plays.

See NFL, page 16

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, August 29. 1990

NFL

Continued from page 15
The Dolphins addressed this

situation by taking offensive
linemen Richmond Webb and
Keith Sims in the first and second
rounds, respectively, of this year’s
draft.

Marino to Clayton remains one
of the best passing combinations
in football. Mark Clayton is not
the biggest or fastest wide

~— receiver, but is incredibly quick

and makes clutch catches. TE
Ferrell Edmunds is a gifted athlete
who needs to develop softer
hands. What the Dolphin attack
could really use is a return-to-

form by WR Mark, Duper. The
former pro bowler seems to have
lost a step and his desire to be one
of the great deep threats in the
NFL. If Duper can make a
comeback and Smith can avoid
injuries, a wild-card playoff
appearance is not unthinkable in
Miami.

0 Indianapolis Colts -—— The
Indianapolis Colts will not finish
last in the division in spite of
themselves. They can thank the
Jets and Patriots for that. Trading
your kitchen and bathroom sink
for a potentially great shower is a
huge gamble even by Colts’ GM

“Jump on any deal” Jim Irsay’s
standards. This guy cannot “just
say no” to any trade. To trade all-
pro tackle Chris Hinton, WRAndre
Rison and two first-round draft
picks for a QB that some draft
experts said was a second rounder
is not smart management. Jeff
George had better be the next
Dan Marino, or owner Robert Irsay
may have to fire his own son due
to incompetence. Of course,
maybe Robert Irsay is not
competent either. After all, he is
the one who pays Jeff George’s
salary.
Eric Dickerson, also known as

the Colts’ offense, is unhappy
again. He is what league officials
like to call “disgruntled.” Who
would not be “disgruntled” if they
were one of the greatest running
backs of all time and a quarterback
who has never thrown a NFL pass
is making nearly twice as much
money? What is worse, Jim Irsay
has traded proven run blockers
(Hinton and Ron Solt) for
potentially good players. With no
blocking, neither Dickerson or
George can expect to shine in ’90.

The Colt defense is fairly solid.
DE Jon Hand is an underrated
rusher who impressed last season.

The linebacking corps includes
three former pro bowlers: Duane
Bickett, Chip Banks and Fredd
Young. This unit also includes a
future pro bowler in the form of
ILB Jeff Herrod. Herrod, a former
ninth-round pick, plugs holes
inside and is a punishing tackler.
The secondary is steady, if not
spectacular. Eugene Daniel is a
fixture at RCB, with Michael Ball
and Mike Prior at the safety spots.
Look for rookie Alan Grant to
start at LCB. Grant was a fourth-
round pick out of Stanford.

0 NewYork Jets — The New
York Jets have changed airlines
and will now ﬂy Bruce Coslet
instead of Joe Walton. However,
it is doubtful that things will be
any friendlier in 1990 for the Jets.
Coslet brings the Cincinnati
Bengal attack offense to New
York. New GM Dick Steinberg
has imported a lot of dangerous
weapons for the new attack via
the draft. First—rounder Blair
Thomas should be among the
league's leading rushers for years
to come, assuming the offensive
line ever improves. In the
supplemental draft, the Jets added
Syracuse WR Rob Moore to their
arsenal. Some scouts feel he is the
best receiving prospect since Jerry
Rice.

Even with the addition of young
offensive talent, the offense is
unlikely to improve. The players
will have to learn Coslet’s offense
let alone execute it. The offensive-
line situation is grave and there is
little help on the way. Good
offensive linemen are not
acquired through Plan B.

Quarterbacks Ken O'Brien and
Tony Eason will battle for the
starting job; however, that is not
necessarily good for the Jets._
Watch out for rookie QB Troy
Taylor out of California. If things
are out of hand by midseason, he
is likely to get a lot of playing
time. He has great potential for
the future. Al Toon continues to
have great statistics, although no

one passes him the ball
Consistently.
Defensively, the Jets have

already begun the rebuilding
process, with defensive linemen
Dennis Byrd and Ron Stallworth.
Alex Gordon and second-year
man Jeff Lageman lead the
linebacking group. Erik McMillan
heads the secondary. He is a
ferocious tackler and comes up
with a lot of interceptions.
Unfortunately, he sometimes
gambles too much, and the Jets
are vulnerable to the long bomb.
Expect third—round pick Tony
Stargell to win a starting job at
cornerback.

-New England Patriots — It
looks like another dismal year of
football in New England. Coach
Rod Rust takes over a team with
many holes to filll —— the most
vital position being quarterback,
where fossils Marc Wilson and
Steve Grogan will vie for the
starting job. The Patriots need to
find a quarterback who does not
take Geritol prior to games. They
took Tommy Hodson in the third
round out of LSU but do not expect
him to emerge this season.

1990 Panther football captains elected by team consent

Louis Riddick, Craig Gob, Alex
Van Pelt and Eric Holzworth were
voted captains for the 1990 season
by their teammates, Pitt Coach
Paul Hackett announced
yesterday.

Riddick, a strong safety, and
Gob, a linebacker, will captain
the defensive squad, while
quarterback Van Pelt will head

‘the offense, and tight end

Holzworth will anchor the special
teams.

“It was a surprise,” said Van
Pelt, who was the first non-senior
to be honored as such since Kelcy
Daviston in 1974. “I didn’t even
know that you could even vote
for lunderclassmenl.”

“It's a real honor,” said
Holzworth. “Especially since I’m
not a starter and all. Coach Hackett
says that special teams is one-
third of the game. Special teams is
the place where it’s easiest to score
on one play, but it’s also easy to

give up the score too.”

Hackett said that his return
teams this season would be a
major offensive weapon, while
the kicking teams would be
preventive maintenance, keeping
the opponents deep in -their own
territory. The Panthers will put
their best players on special teams
this year in order to develop
opportunities both offensively
and defensively under special-
teams coach Scott O’Brien’s

current philosophy.

In addition to the four, Hackett
said that other game captains will
be named each week for those
who perform the best at practice
and the last game, an idea that at
least one of the four agreed with.

“So often it seems that captains
are elected and others shy away
from being a leader,” said Gob.
“We’ll have a lot of leaders, rather
than having one leader and a
bunch of followers.”

In keeping with his “no star”
operation philosophy, Hackett is
firmly entrenched in the theory
that a football team should elect
its own leadership.

“When you have guys who have
been through such a hard camp
up in Johnstown, it’s only fair for
them to elect their leadership,

since everyone has seen what the ,

others can do,” Hackett said.

Frazier's eligibility rewrites current placekicking script

Pitt Coach Paul Hackett
announced yesterday that place-
kicker Ed Frazier has regained his
eligibility for the 1990 season.
Frazier was suspended by Hackett
last spring for academic reasons
and was also barred from
participating in fall camp.

Hackett said Frazier, a

sophomore from Hampton High,
will begin practice today but will
be suspended for the first two

games this year for violating team
rules over the spring and summer.
Frazier was the Panthers’
leading scorer last year with 77
points as a freshman walk—on. He
converted 14 of 20 field goals and
35 of 36 extra—point attempts for
the Panthers, including a game-
tying 42—yard field goal at West
Virginia as time ran out.
Frazier will join Scott Kaplan,

the team’s leading scorer in 1988,

[PITT BITS

Pitt’s soccer team has been picked to finish last in the
1990 Big East Soccer Coaches’ Poll. O

The Panthers finished at 8-6-3 last year, and 1-3-0 in
the Big East.

Seton Hall was chosen as the top team with 58 points
in the voting, just ahead of Syracuse (57) and defending
conference champ Connecticut (56). The Panthers
received nine points.

This season, the Big East has gone to a full round-
robin regular season schedule, replacing the North and
South division format of the previous five years. The top
four teams will qualify for postseason play.

Charles Knoles has replaced Dick Bradshaw as head
of the men’s swimming team. Knoles, 36, was head

coach of the Fort Lauderdale (Fla) Swimming Team, a
United States Swimming (USS)-affiliated program based
at the International Swimming Hall of Fame. Bradshaw
resigned to concentrate on his duties as head of Pitt’s
Aquatics Club and a physical education instructor at Pitt.

Mark Jackson has been named as Pitt’s new baseball
coach, replacing Bobby Lewis. Jackson was formerly the
baseball coach at Point Park, where his teams were
nationally ranked. Lewis had been the Panthers’ coach
for the past 36 years before retiring lastjune. Lewis has
taken the position of Assistant Athletic Director of Men’s
Sports.

The women’s volleyball team has been ranked 19th

in Volleyball Montblys 1990 Preseason Top 20 poll,
the first time in several years that the Lady Panthers
have made the list.

“That’s always been one of our goals, to break into
the top 20, but we want to be there at the end of the
season,” said second-year head coach Sue Woodstra.
“A preseason poll doesn’t carry as much weight. It just
means that we have to earn our way into the postseason
poll and the NCAA T oumament.”

The Lady Panthers open the 1990 season this
weekend at the Wisconsin Tournament where they
will be tested right away, facing No. 1 ranked UCLA
and No. 20 Wisconsin. Pitt will also play at least five
other Top 20 teams this season— No. 4 Texas, No. 7
Ohio State, No. 15 Penn State, and No. 18 Colorado.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, August 29, 1990

 

Names

Continued from page 15

for vendors of Pitt programs, as '

fans will have more of a reason to
buy one just to ﬁgure out who’s
who. In Johnstown, spectators
were hounding Pitt officials for
rosters and depth charts so that
they could figure out who they

were seeing on the practice ﬁeld. .
In game action, the situation will

be the same, only the uniforms
will look a lot nicer.

But Hackett has a different sales
pitch.

“We don’t need any ‘high
school’ socks, headbands [or]
patches. It should be enough to
run into Pitt Stadium wearing that

helmet that says ‘Pitt’ on it saying, 7-

‘Hey, we’re going to get after you.’

“If you have great pride in your
institution and yourself as a team,
you don’t need all those individual
things,” he said.

Basically, Hackett wants people
to know his athletes by the way
they perform. When a fan sees
No. 92 breaking through an

opponent’s line to record a QB‘

sack or stuff the running backs,
he’ll know that’s Keith Hiamilton.
Or when No. 35 pulls down a
pass, fans will know it’s converted
flanker Ricky Turner.
(Or just look at the roster.)

NFL ——

Continued from page 16

a bruising back, but he needs
more holes to run through. The
right side of the offensive line is in
direstraits. Ron Wooten and David
Viaene have had problems

moving defensive linemen out of
the way. Left tackle Bruce

Armstrong is a good pass blocker
and even better run blocker. The

majority of running plays will 

again go to the left side. Robert
Perryman is an underrated runner
and a solid lead blocker at
fullback. The receiving corps is in
good shape with Hart Lee Dykes,
Irving Fryar, Cedric Jones and
third-rounder Greg McMurtry.
Dykes had a good rookie
campaign and will continue to
improve. Fryar needs to develop
consistency.

The defense needs the return
of injured veterans Andre Tippett,
Garin Veris and Ronnie Lippett. If
these players can come back
healthy, the defense will be greatly
improved. First—rounders OLB
Chris Singleton and DE Ray
Agnew will be counted on to
better the team’s pass rush. FS
Fred Marion leads the secondary.
Lippett will be on the hot seat
since Raymond Clayborn went to
the Browns via Plan B. No matter
what happens, it will be difficult
for the Patriots to escape the cellar.
