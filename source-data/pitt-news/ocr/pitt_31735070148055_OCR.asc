Although students might be used
to swiping their Panther Cards ,_ this

summer the Port Authority will test

out a new method of using the Pitt
ID:' the tap.

This year, the Port Authority in-
stalled new fare boxes onbuses that
will allow for “smart card” technol-

S ogy. Jim Ritchie, a Port Authority

spokesman, said that while the new
fare boxes are already installed in all
of the buses, the smart card technol-

‘ ogy will notbe fully adopted until

2012, if preliminary testing in the

    

next few months is successful.
Instead of swiping, transit rid-

ers will press their ID cards against

the designated area on the new fare

. boxes, at which point a red lightwill
indicate that the tap was success-

ful. ‘ I
Ritchie said that the Port Author-

ity will begin testing the new smart .
card system on Pitt student IDs this-
summer. There is not a speciﬁc date "

for the start of this test, but he said
more information will be released
through the University. I ' A .
Ritchie said that the ﬁrst phas
of testing involved Port Authority

employees using smart cards much,

_ The Student Government Board has
spent a semester trying-to clarify al-
locations rules, but even" at the last
meeﬁngofthe semester, therewas still

. confusion in Nordy’s Place last night.

The Board tried to compromise

with student leaders who didrft know

the rules about certain types of alloca-

tions requests. -
Three of the eight requests ‘he

were conference requests that did not A

follow the rules set in the “Allocations
Man .”

All three of those studentleaders
were unaware of the $2,000 cap for
conference requests, and as a result
their requests were well over the
_ Requests exceeded the cap from
$500 to more than $1,000.

I In each case, the-Board attempted
to meet the organizations halfway by
alteringthe requests to approve fewer
members to attend —- there is a prec-
edentto send no morethanfour-—or

like registrationfeesbutnottranspor—

«The Society of Hispanic Profes-

Board tried .to placate. The organiza— _ I

Up the street at the bus stop on the corner
of Fifth and Thackeray, another Pitt student,
sophomore Mei Hong, said that she liked the
idea because people mightbe using expired ID
cards to ride the buses.

On the other side of Litchﬁeld Towers,
Kevin Minehan, a junior majoring in math-
ematics, said he liked the idea of smart card
technology because of its efficiency.

None of those Pitt students, who all said
they ride Port Authority buses multiple times a
week, said they had noticed the new fare boxes.

worked just fine.

Under the current system, students just ﬂash
their Pitt IDs to the bus drivers.

Not allwere pleased with the new technol~
ogy. Angel Pieseski, a daily Port Authority
rider who came to Oakland for a doctor’s ap—

pointment, did not see the necessity of the

fare boxes.

“I think that they were a waste of money,”
she said. “The old fare boxes worked just
ﬁne.” , . ’

The Port Authority spent $33 million on the
changes to the new fare—collection system.

she lamented the 15 percent service cuts that
went into effect last month. Those cuts elimi-
nated 29 bus routes, and according to the Port
Authority website, it reduced weekday service
on more than three dozen routes.

Pieseski, who said she usually buys a
monthly pass that costs $90, didn’t have high
hopes for the smart card technology either.
When asked how she thought it would affect
her Port Authority experience, she answered,

. “They.’ll probably just end up cutting more

Piracy’s for wusses

People often refer to the college-
aged as a volatile mass of risk tak-
ers, pointing to the stages of hu-
man brain development, the low
rates of contraception use during
intercourse and students’ willing-
ness to consume $5 pizzas at 2 am.
on a Tuesday as evidence. For those
who argue that a ﬂirt—with-danger
attitude pervades campuses across
the country, perhaps “music piracy”
can now be added to their card deck
of accusations.

According to International
Business News, a recent study by
researchers at the University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln found-that regardless
of legality, college undergraduates
view music piracy more favorably
than shopliﬁing music. Published in
the March 2011 edition of Psychol-
ogy, Crime and Law, only the study’s
abstract was available yesterday on
Pitt databases, so speciﬁc break-
downs carmot be reported.

According to the IBS report, stu-
dents responding to the idea of steal-
ing a physical CD “expressed various
reasons [for notstealing the CD],
such as morality inﬂuence from fam-
ily and friends, [and] fear of getting
can t.” Butwhen it came to illegally
downloading music, fewer students
cited similar concerns. For college
students, using the Internet to steal
is somehow less morally perplexing
than using your pocket.

If it’s remotely possible, for just
a moment, to put aside the moral
concerns, legal consequences and
the economic costs of ﬁle sharing
—- the Institute for Policy Innova-
tion found in 2007 that it might cost
the U.S. economy $12.5 billion per
year — the broader effects of hyper-
available, digitalized music has not
been entirely negative.

For one, although CD sales have

plummeted since the ’90s, the In- '

ternet has opened up a new source
of income for artists and record
companies alike (at least for those
artists and companies that license

 

 

their work to pay—per-download
music providers like i'I‘unes). The
Recording Industry Association of
America reports that between 2004
and 2010, revenues from digital sales
jumped 1,000 percent.

The prevailing free-music
mindset -—— even if it were put there
through nefarious ﬁle-sharing means
— has resulted, we think, in not only
enhanced consumer freedom but
also an unrivaled publicity oppor-
tunity for artists of all genres and
popularity levels. The free-music
mindset has prompted more artists
to post free, downloadable samples
on their websites or stream them on

You'I‘ube, giving music consumers ,
the chance to instantly pass judg---

ment on- some of the music before

whipping out their credit cards for

the rest of it.

Despite the efﬁciency with which
the downloading culture has en-
dowed the music market, intellec-
tual property should be vigorously
defended. Respectfor copyright laws

is essential to a healthy democracy. ,

Governments and universities clearly
realize this —- students should too.

After revisions were made in
2008 to the Higher Education Act, all
American colleges and universities
were required to implement plans to
“effectively combat the unauthorized
distribution of copyrighted material
by users of the institution’s network.”
Like any higher education institution
keen on keepingfederal funding, Pitt
fulﬁlls its obligations — it maintains
a policy that does not permit ﬁle shar-
ing within its network, advertises the
policy at freshman orientation and
follows a carefully deﬁned procedure
in response to evidence ofWeb-based
copyright infringement.

However often we catch that
lust—for—free-stuff virus so conta-
gious among us college students, we
shouldn’t let our youthful frugality
supersede another’s rights. And if
we do, at least we should be ready
to face the music. ,

With the advent of springtime, you
guys need to put down those video
game controllers and Toblerones
so that you can start working on
the summer bod of your dreams.
You’ve’ got only a few weeks to
reach that long-coveted goal of a
tripped 220—pound physique, which
means you’ll have to “hardgain” the
necessary weight and then ‘fshredl
Hydroxycut” down to your physical
peak. All of this might‘ sound
intimidating to the bodybuilding
“n00b,” but we’re old hands at this
game and more than willing to share
our wisdom with you.
Bodybuilding veterans will tell
you that the “hardgaining” phase
is the most ﬁm part of the program.

No holds should be barred as you»

struggle to amass the avoirdupois
requiredfor subsequent “shredding/
. Hydroxycutting”‘ activities. The
Freshman 15 (or 50, if you’vebeen
especially lucky) is a big help here,

this interminable Pittsburgh winter

The gallon- of-milk-a- day

_(“GOMAD”) dietary plan has

been recommended by nutrition
experts ranging from that one really
boisterous guy in Zubaz shorts at
the gym to the angel of death who
keeps appearing in our dreams.

To succeed, consume a gallon"

of whole milk every single day.

Gastrointestinal distress is bound ,

to result, but a ripped 220—pound
frame is well worth a few noisome
farts. Besides, you’re in college -
and what hot college comedy would
be complete without a character
who amuses his bros with some
gut—busting ﬂatulence‘? It’s a can’t-
lose proposition, friends.

An ’ alternative to GOMAD is
the equally affordable and equally
delicious eight—ﬁve-dollar—pizzas-
a-day plan (“EFIDOPAD”). Simply
shake off that late—semester
hangover —’ the carbs in beer are
great for developing the sort of
shirt-ﬁlling puﬂiriess that drives the

with the Louisiana Purchase —
and then‘ plop down in front of the
TV. Consume the pies slowly while
watching reruns of “SportsCenter”

on ESPN, and you’ll reach your

target weight in no time at all.
After you’ve hit that target
weight, it’s time for the “shreddingl
Hydroxycutting” to commence.
The least painful way to do this is
to stop eating for a few weeks while
maintaininga24/7 exercise schedule
(but be careful, because even the air
contains fat—laden carbs). You can
combat painful hunger pangs by
taking sips of sugar water from a
baby bottle and sleeping at least 15
hours per day. Diarrhea is a fantastic
way to lose those love handles, with a
combination of heavy-duty laxatives
and heavy—duty adult diapers certain
to yield rapid results. If you’re a real
sissy, you can allow yourself 100-
200 carb-laden calories per day -
just as long as you’re willing to do

Bateman 4 6

Well, according to surveys conducted in those
glossy magazines you ﬁnd near the checkout
line, the sexiest parts of the human body
are the biceps, the forearms and the calves.
The purpose of “hardgaining” is to beef up
those parts so that there’s even more of them,
with “shredding/Hydroxycutting” serving to
add all those super-sensual veins that your
signiﬁcant other enjoys caressing. _ '
' Once you’re roughly the size of a barge,

begin preparing for your big—screen beach T

debut. This is your moment, and with 220

ripped pounds on your side, it’s likely that the .

beach bunnies are going to hear you coming
longbefore you stroll into view clad in naught
save the turquoise Speedo that Daniel Craig
made famous in “Casino Royale.”

As soon as your would—be admirers catch
sight of you, you’re going to want to clear the
sands of possible rivals. Take a break from

. periodically kissing and rubbing your massive

guns long enough to strike a “most muscular”

‘pose. When deployed properly, a fearsome

“most muscular” can cause even the pointiest
club-spiked hairdo to wilt. Afterward, gambol
and pirouette through a sequence of glamorous

poses ranging from the ever-popular “front
lat spread” to the awe-inspiring “serratus
intercostals twisted crunch.” V

By now, you’ve undoubtedly secured your
position as the hero of the beach. No one can
deny your spectacular body symmetry or the

smooth ﬂow between your muscle groups.‘

Your bone structure looks fabulous —— so
fabulous that it more than compensates for the
fact that you can’t bend your arms to scratch

. your neck or drop. into a crouch to catch a
baseball. Who cares aboutany of that crap,
anyway? If it were "Christmas, your massive

gaining is easy.

calves could stuff even the most capacious
stocking, and beloved homemaker Martha
Stewart could hang one heck of a wreath off
your enormous “pec deck.” Make no mistake,
friends: You couldn’t see a better human being
if you tried. ,

The Fair Housing Project has been

, passing on their message to stop

discrimination in housing in a dif-
ferent way than many organiza-
tions: with a poetry slam.

For the past ﬁve years, the Fair

 Housing Partnership of Greater _
. Pittsburgh -— a nor_1—proﬁt_ dedicat-

ed to promoting equal housing in
the greater Pittsburgh area — has
invited local, socially—conscious
poets to compete in a poetry slam
for cash prizes of $500, $250 and
$100. The organizers aim to raise

' awareness about housing discrim-

ination. The event includes a sug-
gested $5 donation.
Terrance Hayes, recent Na-

tional Book Award winner, Pitt ’

y slamifor equal housing  

alumnus and this year’s master
of ceremonies emphasized in an
e-mail that, in slam poetry, “Ele-
ments of performance and deliv-
ery are as important as the poem
itself. Audience engagement is
essential.” '
In other words, slam as a genre
is suited to the Fair Housing Part-
nership’s larger project of raising
awareness of discrimination" and
generating conversation.

hosting the slam, said the timing
isn’t random: “April is Fair Hous-
ing Month. In,April of 1968, short-
ly after Martin Luther Kingjr. was

I assassinated, the Fair Housing Act
was signed into law. We do some- '

thing every year to commemorate
that.” .

“We have poets talk about is-
sues related to housing, housing
choice, diverse communities, in-

clusive communities and so on.‘

The object is to get people in the
community to come talk about fair
housing and express themselves.
Our job is just to give people a fo-

Record Store Day

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

People celebrate everything from
Passover to 4/20 in April, but for
music fans, April 16 particularly
resonates with meaning..

The third Saturday in April
is known to followers as Record
Store Day, created in 2007 to “cel-
ebrate the art of music” with special
events that connect artists and fans
through independent record stores.
The Alliance for Independent Media
Stores, the Coalition of Independent

Music Stores and Music ‘Monitor '

Network created and organize the
event. *

In practice, it’s like an auditory
Christmas, bringing out everything
from barbecues to special vinyl re-
leases and remindingus —— the mu-

sic fans — of the special place the
“local places” hold in our hearts.

With the rise of the Internet and j

the ascension of illegal mediums,
such as torrents, and even legal
mediums like iTunes, many record
stores saw the writing on the wall
and closed in the wake of this shift in
the industry. Stores simply couldn’t
compete with the ease of the Inter-

net. (“Give me convenience or give '

me death,” as the Dead Kennedys
would say). -

Even my hometown’s mainstay
-— a local chain known as theAGal—
lery of Sound —— closed down its
local branch after my senior year
in high school, as part of the trend
that affected even bigger players
like the Tower Records and Virgin
Megastore chains.

Sure, there’s always some stuff
at places like Walmart in addition to

what can be bought on the Internet

a holiday for music lovers

— it’s not as though you can’t buy
music. But how does a digital album
compare to that ﬁrst. real CD we all
had? You remember the CD.

It’s with that general idea in
mind that this event got started in
2007, bringing in heavy names like
Vampire Weekend, Death Cab For

‘Cutie and R.E.M. to create special,

limited-edition releases for the
more than 300 record stores par-
ticipating. Artists sympathetic to
independent music like Billy Bragg
did live appearances at record stores
to promote the event.

By the next year, the event was
recognized by New‘ York City May-
or-Michael Bloomberg and grew
to thousands of shops across the
United States and the rest of the
world. I '

This yearwas no less spectacular.

Record Store Day 4 8

sador for the event —— taking over from last
year’s ambassador,]osh Homme of Queens‘ of
the Stone Age fame — and numerous special
releases came down the pipeline.

All different musicians got something out

there. The Rolling Stones released a 7-inch a

single of “Brown Sugar.” Gorillaz released the
physical version of their album The Fall. Even

the Beastie Boys released a remix of “Make '

Some Noise” to beneﬁtjapan Relief Fund. ‘

. If you want to pick up most of these releases
though, you’d better start searching eBay or
preparing that special “Animaniacs” picture

Part of what makes a record store great is the
rarity of what you ﬁnd there.

Despite Record Store Day’s creation stem-
ming from the collapsing nature of the music
industry, since its inception there has been
movement toward a healthy future.

Since the event began, record sales have
soared, with places like Best Buy and Urban
Outﬁtters offering various amounts of vinyl

equipment to the burgeoning music enthusi— J
ast. Plus, it’s not just the Beatles and Pink Floyd

that sell. An array of releases that include big

albums from Radiohead and Neutral. Milk _

Hotel are increasingly popular, signaling the

viability of post—vinyl artistsin the format.
Perhaps one of the best signs of how record

. stores can succeed in the modern age, how— .
ever, comes from White Stripes frontmanjack ‘

White’s Third Man Records in Nashville.

By founding a combination studio/record g ’ A

store, the eccentric musician and music en-

thusiast has caused kids to line—up around 1

the block for special releases and has intro-
duced several innovative methods for dis-
tributing music — including a jukebox that
plays through mechanical monkeys. (You read
that right.) '

Though so many music mediums are ab-
stract, for at least one day ayear, the grooves
of a disk can become concrete in our hands.’
Though the reach of Record Store Day is lim-
ited and many of theexclusive releases are
probably sold out at this point, thousands
of others wait at places close by, like Wicked
Discs on South Craig Street or the Exchange
on Forbes Avenue. Go on, support the inde-

nonprofessional artists can contribute to
the solution. Pitt student Nashid Ali doesn’t
think poets can always make a direct impact
on the issue of unfair treatment in hous-
ing.
“The problem is, poets often stay just
poets. Baseball players for example can af-
ford their own buildings and not have them
be their main source of income, so they can

create affordable housing and not worry '

so much about making a proﬁt, whereas
a private corporation only ‘cares about its
bottom line,” Ali said.

But until artists have accrued enough
capital to implementthe kinds of programs
Ali discussed, he’d like to see them “proph-
esize where the best avenues are to go.”

Events like this Thursday’s slam provide
a space for exactly that sort of discussion.
Hayes said in an e-mail that he’d like to see
the competing poets “take the ﬂatness and
cliche out of ‘political discourse’ and re-
place it with a more human and personal
discourse about the ways politics impact
individual lives.”

the event a slam,Jay Dworin, program direc-

Act, said the event invokes “the spirit of
the griot,” the West African poet-historians
who act as keepers and performers of oral
tradition.

Dworin said that the conversation needs
to continue, and he stressed that discrimi-
nation on the basis of race, religion, national

- origin, disability status, familial status or

sexual orientation happens regularly.

As an example of housing unfairness, *
Harvey cited Tim Grant’s April 8 story in
the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, which pub-
lished the results of 200 recent Fair Housing
Partnership tests concerning discrimination
against the deaf. According to the article,
“researchers found 28 percent of landlords
contacted by deaf people either hung up the
phone, gave false information or used some
other illegal means to deny the deaf person
a place to live.” J’ ' '

He said that he also ﬁelds call from i
' people reporting housing discrimination.

“I get about 150 cases a year, so basically
every other day someone is calling with a
legitimatecomplaint of discrimination,”
he said. . —

Another example Harvey gave was mort-
gagelending, saying that when the group
checked out mortgage lending, it found that"

the level of service —- how long an agent . '

talked with a person, the kind of informa-
tion she provided, and the interest rate
quoted —— varied between races. '

‘ Dworin added that the student popula-
tion is not immune to discrimination. “We
get Pitt students here every yearwho have
been victimized,” he said.

Harvey would like to see more of these
students come to participate adding that
the event is open to anyone and everyone, .

' ﬁrst—timers included. ‘

“We’ve always been puzzled as to why
there weren’t more students. Also, we’d
like to see more people from the disabled
community and from different ethnic com-

munities, for example. We’ve certainly made

 outreach efforts to those communities,” V

FOOTBALL

Quarterbacks important to Graham’s system

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬂ’ Writer

According to headcoach Todd
Graham, the key to the future of
the Pitt football program is the
development of his quarterbacks:
Tino Sunseri, Mark Myers and
Anthony Gonzalez.

At Pitt’s intrasquad Blue-Gold
Game on Saturday, the impor-

' tance of the quarterback was on

display as starter Sunseri, who
has thrown for 300 yards once in
his career, attempted 55 passes,
mostly from the shotgun, and
picked up 416 passing yards.
The junior has had to ab-

sorb “like a sponge,” as Graham T

phrased it, one of the more intri-
cate systems in college football.
The system, one that Graham has
repeatedly described as no-hud-
dle, high-octane and explosive,
centers around a quarterback
who iscapable of running the
intricate offense.

“It takes time to learn,”
Graham said. “This system is
somewhat complicated, and all
the pressure, I’ll tell you, is on
the quarterback. This isa quar-

terback-driven offense. We’ve
got to have a quarterback that
is smart and makes good deci-
sions. We’ve been impressed with
[Sunseri].” 1 V
Overall, the Blue-Gold Game
showed that Pitt’s skill positions

—— recruits from the methodi- .

cal, plodding Dave Wannstedt era
— have adapted to Graham’s up-

tempo, no—huddle scheme.

The offensive productivity
stood in stark contrast to that

of last year’s Blue-Gold Game,

in which the offense scored one
touchdown on a 9—yard run by
Sunseri and former star running
back Dion Lewis picked up just 74
total yards on five carries. 
Looking back, the 2010 Blue-
Gold Game was an omen of an of-
fense that often struggled during
the season, most notably during a
35-10 loss to West Virginia. If this
season’s game is any indication,
Pitt"won’t be struggling to put
points on the board very often.
Pitt averaged 26.3 points ‘per

game last season, while Graham’s’

Tulsa squad put up 4'1.4'points
per game — seventh in the na-
tion. Pitt ranked 65th.

But despite the -offensive

showing in the Blue-Gold Game,
Graham was the ﬁrst to admit
that nobody should read too
much into Sunseri’s more than
400 passing yards and the start-
er-laden Blue team’s '48-13 vic-
tory. ’
“Gold was made up mostly of
our twos with some guys mixed
in,” Graham said in the post—game
news conference. “Naturally, the
score was pretty predictable.”
Gonzalez also used his feet
well on Saturday, scrambling for
39 yards and avoiding pressure
all afternoon, but the challenge
of leading Pitt’s offensive ‘sup-
porting cast against its defensive

starters was too great. He fin- A

ished just 9 for 26, for 82 yards
with two interceptions.

Graham said he.was impressed
with both Gonzalez and Sunseri,
but it’s clear his quarterbacks are
still learning the complicated
system’s nuances.

“It doesn’t -even matter what

the yards were today,” he said.
“We’re not even close to where we -

want to be in this offense.”

The Panthers’ offense hadn’tscored

“[That win] was very important,”
Pitt head coach Holly Aprile said in an

direction for us. We got back to doing

The Huskies jumped ahead early
in the ﬁrst game, eventually earning

Dixon announces the addition of top recruiter Bill Barton.

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

Bill Barton will join the Pit-t men’s basketball
coaching staff as the tearn’s newest assis-
tant, head coach Jamie Dixon announced
yesterday. '

Barton,‘ 50, was the head coach at Notre
DamePrep in Fitchburg, Mass., from 1999.-
2007 before serving as an assistant at
Duquesne University from 2007-08 and
an associate head coach at Duquesne from
2008-10, ‘ 

He spent last season as an assistant
coach at Marshall ‘University, serving-un-

der former Pitt associate head coach Tom

Herrion.

Barton arrives at Pitt with the reputa-
tion as one of the best recruiters on the
East Coast. _ '

‘ “With his numerous recruiting contacts,
Bill will help us in recruiting, scouting
and player development,” Dixon said in a
news release. “We are fortunate to have a
coach with his well-rounded and vast back-
ground.” -

1,000 rebounds.]ames was the 2008 Atlan-
tic 10 Defensive Player of the Year. L

“I’m extremely excited to join the Pitt
stall" and to return to Pittsburgh,” Barton
said in a news release. “We obviously want
to continue the great tradition established
at Pitt. The program’s championship success
speaks for itsel .”

_During his time at Notre Dame Prep,
Barton guided the school to consecutive
Prep School National Championships in
2005-06 and 2006-07. He ﬁnished with a
255-66 overall record.

He also helped more than 70 players earn

by the Washginton Wizards in 2010 and also
currently plays for the Timberwolves.

Barton also coached‘ former Pitt point
guard Carl Krauser and Syracuse stand-
out Paul Harris during their time at Notre
Dame Prep. Krauser played at Pitt from
2001-05, while Harris played at Syracuse
from 2006-09.

Panthers run. 100 plays on offense

«Football ( 11

‘occasionally Saturday, especially on risk-
ier gadget plays. The Blue offense ran a
ﬂea—flicker late in the game, but Sunseri
had to throw the ball away under pressure
from the Gold front seven.

Graham admitted the team ran “pretty
basic stuf ” throughout the scrimmage. ‘

“We’ve got training wheels on right
now,” he said. _

Players have had to ‘adjust to the

_, _game speed that Graham touted when he .

brought his system; to Pittsburgh from
Tulsa. Sunseri and the offensive line have
spent much of the spring working on lining
up as quickly as possible, and the entire
offense has quickened its pacebetween
plays.

“The ﬁrst day when we got out there,
when everybody was running from drill

to drill and everybody was yelling ‘high »

octane’ and [wide receiver coach Mike]
Norvell was yelling to hurry up, we kind
oflooked at each other like

a.-vs. 5-La‘-rum av ua.:.I.u,

scrimmage. ‘As each practice moved on,
we felt like our offense got more and more '
comfortable.” '
Conditioning the players for the sea-
son has been a priority for the coaching
staff this spring. Pitt forewent a halftime
Saturday and played for more than two

. hours with no intermission. In total, the

Panthers ran 100 plays on offense, and
defensive starters each saw about—.80.

“Toward the end there, they were tired.
They probably haven’t run 100 snaps in
maybe ever,” Graham said. ' H '

Now that the coaches have introduced
the offense, the players will have more
time to adjust to both the system and the
game speedduring "training camp this
summer.

Saturday was the ﬁrst time under Gra-
ham that the-Panthers reached triple—digit
snaps, and it showed as the scrimmage
went on”. The firepower‘ displayed in the
ﬁrst quarter turned into punts by the
fourth -—— 15 in all. _

“We came out quick. We started off
pretty strong,” wide receiver Mike Sha-
nahan said after the game. “Then there
was a lull where we had some penalties
and some turnovers ... The 100 plays might

_.......s.... 

edt last season. With Graham at the helm,
Tulsa ran 1,006. '

The passing game looked crisp on
Saturday despite the steady rain that fell

‘ for most of the scrimmage. Some have
— doubted the effectiveness of a high—tempo

offense at Heinz Field —— a playing surface

for more miommti<m' azeim co: atzt

snazzy ﬁegtztz Qaxitixersijasebait g.ma.iI.eom_,

 

~ often chewed up by inclement weather and.

sometimes by twoigame weekends —-‘ but
the results Saturday suggest otherwise.

“We’re going to have games like that,
especially in this part of the country,” Gra-
ham said. “We threw for over 400 yards,
and I’m standing in ankle-deep water on
that ﬁeld. That was one of the most en—
couraging things, seeing how accurately
we.threw our edge passes and our come-
back passes.” _

Graham recalled Tulsa’s 2009 bowl
game against ‘No.’ 22 Ball State to show
that he won’t change his game plan based
on the weather. _

Playing in torrential rain that turned
the ﬁeld into mud, Graham’s Golden Hurg
ricane racked up 632 total yards in a 45-13
blowout.

Sunseri-, a Pittsburgh native, said he
prefers bad weather because it puts pres-
sure on the opposing secondary, which has

to ,_match wide receivers’ cuts on a oor
p?ayll.'Ig‘S1II'Iace.'tiTananruoesnT1rnug‘u1c‘

weather, either.
“It doesn’t matter — rain, sleet, snow,
wind,’f he said. “It doesn’t affect how we’re

' going to operate. We’re going to.run our of?

fense. We’re going to throw the ball. We’re

_ going to run the ball. We’re going to do all

the things just like we always do.” 3

The Panthers sent Berlinerbacktothe mound
for Sunday’s game, and she too responded with a
complete game, holding the Huskies to only two-'-
mns as Pitt clinched the series with a 5-2 win.

Tutt and senior Ashley Amistade each scored
a run in the ﬁrst, and the Panthers held that lead
throughoutthe game While Berliner keptthe Con-
necticut offense at bay. Berliner allowed six hits

A and struck out four batters.

“Itwas a goodfeelingtowinthose games and
realizethatthiswasstillthesameteamlremember
that got off to agreatstartthathasbeen gone for

Pitt only lost consecutive games two other
times this season, a threegame losing streak to
Maryland, Texas and LSU stretching from late’

February to early March and losses to Penn State »

and Ohio State on March 29 and April 6, respec—

offensehas typically struggled asthey’vebeen shut
outﬁve times. Pitthas only scored overthree runs
in one defeat, a 5-4 loss to Maryland on Feb. 27.

The Panthers will look to continue their road

game series against St._]ohn’s with two games on
