Memorial, the

mittee of WSGA announced.

Three hundred freshman wom-
en join in the oldest of all wom-

Expressing the University's
cellor Fitzgerald said, “We take pride in the rec-

in ‘our war training program, and in our research

Under the direction of Dr. William S. lvlcljllroy,
dean of the School of Medicine, and the late Dr.
H. Edmund Friesell, former dean of the School of
Dentistry, Pitt averaged 52 medical and 3? dental

morning.

The Panther offensive col-
umns, utilizing buses, trains,
and private vehicles, should
throw over 800 eifectives into
the grid battle Saturday after-
noon.

Two Pullmans, bearing 51
players and grid staff, pulled
out of Pittsburgh last night, fol-

men this morning. .

The team should be warming up
for tomorrow’s foray this after-
noon, while the band takes a

heading into Ann Arbor for re-
hearsals tomorrow morning.

Beginning late this afternoon,
an estimated 600 students will
start pulling out, with departures
slated all evening and tomorrow
morning. In addition to scores of
private cars, three buses have
been privately chartered for the
trip.

The Delta Zeta’s sponsored ‘one
bus, inviting any interested stu-
dents to go along, while two other
buses, chartered by groups of fra-
ternity men also will carry a
large number of Pittites to Michi-
gan and back.

The week—end will be a full one
for most of those making the
trip, as many students plan. to

re-embark for Pittsburgh at mid-
night Saturday, however.

Estimates on the number of stu-

-Hollywood  Uses Pitt

An article appeared in Tuesday’s edition

concerning the group of celebrities who dc-'

scended on Pitt ’s campus the previous Friday.
The ﬁrstsentencc read, “In spite of the lack of
enthusiasm shown by the Pitt Players toward

the stars of “Unconquered,” C. B. DeMille g,

and his busy group put on quite a show Fri-
day afternoon.”

, This sentence has been the subject of much
discussion between the Pitt News and the Play-
ers.

A clariﬁcation is necessary.

It is true that the Players were unenthusi-
astic toward the display of personalities that
visited here last Friday; they are not to blame
for that attitude, a commendable one. Any-
one who attended the gathering could see that

it was a trumped up publicity scheme and*

that the Players were not .getting their share
of the publicity.
Rushed -and slightly confused, Paul Rogal

F and Lucille Bodnar attempted to read a scene

from “Unconquered.” It is doubtful if either
of the two gained anything from Mr. DeMille’s
coaching. They were interrupted even before
he could tell whether the acting was good or

- bad. Pictures were taken and the entourage of

Hollywoodites was herded into rented limou-
sines and whisked away, leaving everyone,
including the Players, wondering just what

- had happened.

Cops Loaf Saturday

The Tuesday edition of the News carried
an article griping about the prominent posi-
tion that “scalpers” play in the Saturday af-
ternoon scene at Pitt Stadium. A couple more
gripes are forthcoming, said gripes aimed at
the blue-coated boys from the Oakland police
station. _

With the proper amount of vigilance on
the part of the police, certain situations can be

. remedied in the future. The traffic division of

the force doesn’t let one violator slip by With-
out‘ at least a two dollar tag, as many students

can testify.

There were numerous policemen on duty
inside the stadium but when the directors of
the student demonstration block asked for the
aislesto be cleared, not one of the cops was
to be found for assistance. What if the fans
had decided to go onto the ﬁeld to cheer the
team as they came out for the second half?

Those gauntlet—like lines are Pitt tradition,

in and in the process of getting back to the stands

there might have been much confusion and pos-

sible injuries to the students. It just might have

happened. It might yet happen.

After the game, many spectators were con-
fronted by hawkers peddling their junk jewel-
ry outside every exit of the stadium. Does the
police force know if all these salesmen have
peddler’s licenses? Probably not, because a
great portion of them tour the country sell-

ing their wares at athletic events like the re-

cent Notre Dame game.

Is it fair that they should be permitted to
obstruct trafﬁc just outside the exits‘! If it is
Within their rights to sell, why can’t they do‘
it at the edge of the sidewalks?

The average fan doesn’t mind being pester-
ed by the young news boys but being button-
holed by scalpers, gamblers, and peddlerscan
be annoying. Maybe Lieutenant Maloney could
do a bit of good with his “marauders” here.

Almost any kind of action would be a
help to straighten out a situation that has

' Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor: »
How revolting can a thing get?

How much will the student body
of a large university take before

they protest? ..

Last Friday L had the misfor-
tune to witness Cecil B. DeMille’s
direction of a scene from “The
Unconquered” on the campus of
this university. The picture of the
Great Man, with ' his retinue of
yes-men, fawning actors, painted
Showgirls, newspaper photogra-
phers and reporters, condescend-
ingly “directing” a handful of
Pitt Players in a so-called scene
from his juvenile epic, is one the
student body will not soon forget.
In the short period‘ of 15 minutes,
Mr. DeMille effected a truly Grand
Entrance, scurried across the lawn
to an improvised stage, made a
sugary little speech, magnani—
mously directed a 1-minute scene
for which the Pitt Players had
spent hours in preparing, posed
for photographers, and, scurrying
back across the lawn, made an
even Grander Exit. ,

Never have I witnessed such a
blase insult to the intelligence of
so many people delivered in such
a short space of time, with such
bumptious effrontery. In Holly-
wood this may be sure-ﬁre for-
mula for bringing in the pelf;
however, the smog in Pittsburgh
is not yet thick enough to cloud
our reason. .

That this successful, farcical bid
for free publicity was approved by
the university dissapoints me.
From an administration which de-
ﬁnes a moral woman as one‘ who
does not sit on the campus lawn,
I realize we cannot expect too
much. However, we do look for-
ward to the day when the ad-
ministrative officers realize they
are dealing’ with mature young
men and women, and not pre-
kindergarten innocents.

Until then, we probably shall
ﬁnd out for ourselves how revolt-
ing things can get.

Very sincerely yours,
~ ' Jay Alan.

Dear Editor:

I have just ﬁnished reading with
unusual interest the editorial in
the October 3 issue “Hurry Up
And Wait” and the article on the
proposed Lamont Library at Har-

vard. Having worked at the Lend-

 

ing Desk I am most sympathetic
with the reeilngs of patrons who
have to wait occasionally ﬁfteen

minutes, but usually less, for

‘books.

The purpose of this letter is to
remind you that there is on the
sixth floor of the Cathedral a li-
brary room which might be ‘con-
sidered a miniature Lamont li-
brary. There are about three thou-
sand books on open shelves, chos-
en mainly with undergraduate in
mind, books which can be used for
that hour of relaxation, for col-
lateral reading in history, politi-
cal science, English, etc. plus all
the standard works for book re-
ports.

Besides this there are the best
of the new works, and the best
books for the general reader in
philosophy, biography and current
affairs. The easy chairs are here,
and all the sunshine there is. And a
book can be found ands charged
out in two or three minutes.

I've often wondered why more
students do not make use of the
Alldred room and its services;
perhaps editorial comment from
you would help.

‘ Sincerely yours,

Helen Frost Dice.

This Weekend Plus
 Platter Charter Notes
By Jerry Newberg
Riding the 88’s at Bill Green's this weekend
will be the talented ﬁngers of Jack Fina. Fina’s
16-piece ork has a ‘style of music which rests

heavily on adaptations from the classics, the band ‘

sounding much as if the maestro had gotten some
schooling from Freddy Martin.

The band is hoping that its Mercury recordings
will boost it into the big-name class. Also, a stint
in a Columbia ﬁlm has been helpful in spreading
the ork’s talent around to a great number of lis-

teners. Jack did a great job on his recording of‘

“Bumble Boogie” which hit a high in Mercury
record sales.

Majestic artist Eddy Howard will appear at
the Aragon Ballroom Tuesday evening Oct, 328
for a one-nighter. More information about How-
ard will be in next week’s “Music Notes."

Oct. 18-25 is King Cole Anniversary Week. '

The Trio marks its 10th Anniversary by releasing

a special record produced by Johnny Mercer co- A

operating the King, Johnny Miller and Oscar Moore.
The record includes “Save The Bones For Henry
Jones” and “Harmony.”

Pitt Band

(Continued from Page One)
The opening formation will be
a tribute to the maize and blue

‘ dressed corpsmen. The Pitt band

lines into the varsity “M” which,
traditionally, has been staged by
the Michigan band at the, half-
time intermission. The music in
this formationriwill be the “Uni-
versity of Michigan Victors

* March.”

Immediately following this pat-
tern, the ﬁgures “41-47” will be
formed to symbolize the two bands
previous and present engagement.

’ The characteristic themes in this
-, _line—up will include the Air Force,

Navy, and Artillery songs.

To picture the respective in-
termediate years, the Pitt corps
will step into 42, 43, 44, and 45
after an “Olde Lang Syne” fan-
fare. On each year, a rendition de-
picting the passingof time will be
played in progressive chords.

In the number 43, the band will
present a novelty stunt when all
the bandsmen sing out in unison
“When the war is over we will all
enlist again!” But when the for-
mation 45 appears. “Happy Days’.’
will be played, stressing the war’s
termination.

The music, “It’s Always Fair
Weather When Good Fellows Get
Together,” marks the ﬁnal year,
47,, followed by a punctuated
shout, “Hallalujah.”

The Pitt band left Pittsburgh
by chartered buses at 10:45 a. m.
today with personnel totaling 155.

The band will arrive in Detroit

, at 6:30 p. In. and will stay over

night in the Hotel Fort Shelby.
At 8:45 ‘a. m. Saturday the band

of many steel girders and one

semi—completed story.

For some strange reason, that
uncompleted story happened to be
the seventh ﬂor. Why, no one
knows; and of course, it wasn’t
done through any encouragement
of the student engineers who had
classes on the seventh and who
were compelled to traverse , the
wind blown stairs.

It was in the winter of 1932
that the postman’s creed ﬁrst be-
came synonymous with the code
of Mr. Forrest. The incident was
a ﬁre caused by short-circuiting
of some weather-beaten cables
near an elevator shaft in the
ﬂoor - less, wall - less Cathedral.
The ﬁre was reported by Scotty
at two in the morning. The result
-—-one near—frozen caretaker.

On April Fool’s Day of the
year that marked both the initial
year of the Memorial and of his
transfer to that building another
ﬁre taxed Scotty’s slumber at 6
a. m. This disaster cost the Uni-
versity a stage curtain.

The latest episode for Mr. For-
rest was opening the door to the
Memorial social hall last July and
standing abashed in two inches
of slimey water. The sewers had
let loose after a torrential down-
pour and dumped its residue into
the basement ﬂoor.

The arduous task of cleaning up

the debris took “Scotty” and a
crew of ﬁve the entire day.
‘ The wooden ﬂoor however, took

Red Man
At Nixon

By Hugh Gilmour

There’s a ﬁne example of the
living tradition of the theatre on
the Nixon stage this week in the
popular revival of “The Red Mill.”
That tradition has been carried on
by two young women——Paula and
Dorothy Stone, daughters of Fred
Stone," who starred in the original
production more than forty years
ago.

When it ﬁrst played Pittsburgh,
Fred Stone was the"top comedian
and “The Red Mill” was one of
the biggest successes. His little
girls, no doubt, were bred on his

. recollection of the show. Just a

few seasons‘ ago, when the Los
Angeles Civic Light Opera com-
pany presented it, Dorothy quickly
accepted the offer to play the lead.
She immediately contacted Paula
who, with Hunt Stromberg, Jr.,

was looking for something special .

to produce, and so the “Red Mill”
once again hit Brodway where it
achieved a much greater success
than it had originally.

, Whatever changes have been
made, since the ﬁrst production,
the music is and always will be
the same. A score by Victor Her-
bert is incentive enough for any-
one who likes an evening of song,
and the numbers all are handled
sincerely by the cast. “Because
You’re You” and “Moonbeams”
are two of the favorites.

The dance routines are cute, and

the girls, wrapped up in some gay,
colorful costumes, seem happy
enough. Add some attractive sets
and you’ve got a top-ranking show
-—and that’s exactly what it is.

=1! 4! l

The Nixon changes its mood
to a more serious one, the week
of the twentieth, when it presents
Shakespeare’s “Antony and Cleo-
patra.” Starring as Cleopatra will
be the incomparable Katharine
Cornell, assisted by a distinguish-
ed cast. '

Better Graders

CINCINNATI, O.—(I.P.)-Part-time veteran-students in the Uni-

at Cincinnati

versity of Cincinnati Evening College, employed during the day, are
equaling and in some respects surpassing the generally high rec-
ords being made by the fellow ex-GI’s who are regular full-time

day students.

And these evening campus veterans are outperfermonig their «—

non-veteran classmates.

So observes Dean Frank R.9
N euffer of the Evening College on

the local campus after a survey,
believed to be the ﬁrst of its kind,
to determine how the 3,100 veter-
ans enrolled during the ﬁrst sem-
ester, last year, compared with
the 5,000 non-veterans in the
same semester.

“The survey,” recently com-
pleted, “shows the veteran does
have a slight edge over the non-
veteran in the Evening College,
not only in grades, but in regu-
larity of class attendance, in an-
alytical attention, and in an in-

telligent grasp of the subject mat-
ter,” Dean Neuﬁer said.

The semester "academic average
for the veterans was 78 per cent;
for the non-veteran, 77 per cent.

In the second semester, 82 per
cent of the veterans re.-enrolled

as compared with ’68 per cent of .t

the non-veterans who re-enrolled.

“It should be explained, how-
ever,” Dean Neuﬁer added, “that
this lower percentage of the non-
veteran may be somewhat offset
by several hundred persons who
enrolled in one-semester cultural
subjects only.”

At that time, the club, under thel
chairmanship of Lionel B. Con-

The club fosters interest in lit-
erary subjects and promotes the
exchange of literary ideas among
interested students. It also serves
as a social meeting ground.

School ofﬁcials endorsed forma-
tion of the club, feeling that there
is a great need for such a student
organization. The club is entirely
student-controlled.

While membership will prob-
ably be recruited chieﬂy from
among English and writing ma-
jors, all students interested in the
aims and activities of the group
are invited to join. Voting privil-
eges, however, are limited to grad-
uate students majoring ‘in English.

As now contemplated, regular

‘End of Chaos.
Education's
Job‘-Weekes >

Upon education depends the ur-

gent solution to social and eco-,

nomic problems now plunging both
the nation“ and the world into
chaos. This is the opinion of Ed-
ward Weekes, Editor of the At-

lantic Monthly, and was the es-'

sence of his talk as he openedthe
1947-48 series of Pitcairn-Crabbe
lectures Tuesday evening._ L

Mr. Weekes challenged educa-
tors to close “the ever-widening
gulf between the ideals we dream
and the reality we live” in Ameri-
ca so that governments and peo-
ple abroad may see an honest pic-
ture of “God’s Country” that will
not hamper United States diplo-
matic ventures in behalf of peace.

With 50 per cent of the world’s
population actively or potentially
communistic, the United States is
obligated to put its own house in

order and live up to its demo-.

cratic and moral idealogy. All to
often, Mr. Weekes elaborated,
triﬂing inconsistencies in private
conduct can be warped by the
communistic press into extensive
anti-American propaganda cam-
paigns. ,

No longer, he said, is it possible
for the conscientious citizen to hi-
bernate within the conﬁnes of his
private life when the actions and
personal conduct of each Ameri-
can contributes to the front which
the United States presents to the
world.

Until Americans clear up their
“honest doubts about the destiny
of the United States,” this nation

can never hope to be understood

abroad.
With wealth and power come

responsibilities to the world‘ of

which each citizen must be aware.

Private action, Mr. Weekes claim- ,
ed, is the only key to rational pub- P

lic conduct and only with behavior
engendered by a psychology of

peaceiand good will can America.

expect support and understand-
ing from abroad.

Something went wrong‘ last
week. Sports Editor Golightly
picked an upset, Purdue over Ohio’
State, and the Boilermakers came
out on top. He must have wired
instruction to Fesler to have his
team lay down-—or something.

Meanwhile, Joe Santone and Doc
Gifﬁn have stopped speaking to
each other. The rivalry for the
top spot among the selectors has
been so great that, come Satur-

frenzy. At present they are locked

Goverwhelmed Michigan State 55-0.
Last Saturday, the Ann Arbor Ex. , 
press rolled over a weary Stan-w 
ford outﬁt, 49-13. ’
Haven’t Any Weakness

Dick Cassiano, who’s seen some
great teams, rates the Wolverines’
with the best. Cassiano further
.states that if they have any weak- V
nesses, they haven’t been evident,
so far.

The Michigan team is made up
of two complete units. an often-
sive one and another rugged bunch L
for the defense. In this way the V , 
Crislermen take full advantage of
the free substitution rule. Their 
offense begins from the “T” but ‘ ‘I
about half the time they shift into
the “Minnesota Shift.”

The Minnesota shift is a new
plague upon the Pitts. The Michi- 4
gan line is unbalanced to either
the right or the left. The quarter-
back lines up a yard” behind the‘
inside -tackle. .

The rest of the backﬁeld is back “
four yards and parallel tothe line
of scrimmage. The left half is be-
hind the left guard, while the
full and right half line‘ up behind
’ the right guard and outside tackle.‘

respectively. }. ‘ ~

Cassiano was particularly im- 
pressed by the play of Lennie 
Ford. The big colored boy'is_"an 
exceptional end on the defensive 
unit and occasionally stays in the
game on the -offense to carry or
pass the ball from an end around
He stands six-foot, four inches and '
weighs 215 pounds.

The term offensive and defen- ‘ , .
sive unit is used because the two’.  '
teams aren’t actual ﬁrst and sec- '
ond teams in the ordinary sense _
of the word. They both have their
particular jobs and each eleven
is superior in its own line.

Score in Eight Seconds

Evidence of the Michigan pow-
er is shown by their ﬁrst ‘touch-
down last Saturday that took ex-
actly. eight seconds to complete
after the game started. Chappuis,‘ .
the strong right arm, passed to
halfback Mann for over 50 yards _j=.
-and Mann traveled 25 yards for‘ 
the touchdown. - '

Chappuis is Ann Arbor’s answer‘
to Johnny Lujack. The right half-‘
back from Toledo is a deadly pass-
er. He can charge like a fullback‘
or be used for break away run- 
ning. He is undoubtedly Michi-
gan’s outstanding player.

Tomorrow afternoon will be a .
banner event for the tiring Milli-_ — I
ganmen. It will mark the conclu- ,
sion of the brunt of the schedule.

Wiﬂlouf Knowing The Facts

Golighfly

. ,_ Last Monday, two of the better known downtown sports column-
Zﬁists wound up and threw a couple of verbal haymakers at the Pitt
5" Physical Education Department. It was an aftermath of the Bill
-_“Bruno case which, as everyone should know, hit the headhnes last

- .4

Saturday.

Bruno missed the Notre Dame game because of a pulled leg

4 ,-muscle which he re—injured during a phys ed soccer class last
<:v.Friday. The indignation in the press box Saturday was terriﬁic. And

[LI _was one of the most indignant.

,1}

But being a relatively inexpe-9

rienced newsman, I withheld my

‘ verbal brickbats until I could hear

all sides of the case. I went to
Karl Oermann, director of physi-
cal education for majors in the
School of Education. ‘

He treated me to the most hec-

"tic ten minutes of my brief ten-

. ',-.,.,,|} _; 1l‘!“’:..—« .,

ure as sports editor. Oermann
asked my opinion of the case, and

after I rendered an opinion on ‘

the basis of what I knew, he gave
me‘ the most scathing, ﬁve-minute,
non-army chewing that I have
ever experienced.

Fully Discuss Bruno Case

Oermann -— still nettled by the
free-swinging downtown colum-
nists —- mistook me for a mem-
ber of the same breed. From his
standpoint, I was another sports

writer preparing to dump print-
ers’ ink into his still tender
Wdunds.

It should also be mentioned that
'the last ﬁve minutes of the hectic
ten was a one way affair in which
tyro Golightly blew his stack. Af-
-ter that we both settled down and
discussed the facts in the Bruno
case in a civilized fashion.

Oermann brought out three
particularly interesting points:
. Al. The phys ed department
didn’t know about Bruno’s injury
until’ they read the headlines in

L,

man has an injury, he is excused
immediately.

Dislikes Label of Saboteur

Oermann emphasized that he
intensely dislikes being thought of
as a saboteur of the football team.
He explained that the large num-
ber of athletes majoring in physi-
cal education makes it impossible
to excuse individuals from 1 the
‘classes. ‘ A
‘ His reasoning on this line is
that if they excuse football play-
ers, basketball players, swimmers,

e treatment. However, Oer-
ffnann pointed out that Bobby Lee‘
had been excused from soccer
classes previously when he had a
weak knee.

In view of the School of Edu-
cation’s policy in regard to ex-
cusing athletes from classes, I
sympathize with Oermann’s in-
dignation concerning the attitude
of "the downtown paper.

Climaxing a week of rough
work the Pitt Panthers go through
a light workout at Michigan Sta-
dium this afternoon in prepara-
tion for the third straight suicide
contest. More than 60,000 fans
are expected. 1

Pass defense and passing offense
kept the locals busy last Monday,
but from then on it was rough

and tough going. Assistant Coach
Dick Cassiano ran the reserves
with the Michigan plays, while
Head Coach Mike Milligan in-
structed his proteges in ways of
stoping th Wolverine “T” and
“Minnesota Shift.”

Several changes may be made
by Milligan for tomorrow's game.
Earl Sumpter, probably the best
tackler on the squad, may move
to left end, while Tony Ruzzano
shifts to right guard and Andy
Kisiday moves from‘ center to
guard.

During the last two skirmishes
the Panthers received only a few
minor injuries. However, Bill
Bruno is deﬁnitely out with a
charley horse. Bill Abraham, out
since September 5, may be lost
for the season.

The traveling squad of 35 left
last night at 11:10 p. m. via Penn-
sylvania Railroad headed for De-
troit. At Detroit the team met a
bus which took them to the Dear-
born Inn—located 15 miles from
the playing site at Ann Arbor.

After the game, Pitt will head
for home. by bus to Toledo and
train to Pittsburgh, arriving at
12:20 a. m., Sunday. '

Further investigation disclosed
that the Committee has had the

through the abandonment of more
than 100 special fees involving
thousands of students. The new
incidental fee will also cover in-
creased costs of special services to
students and spread such costs
more equally over the entire stu-

dent body.

The incidental fee is not a tui-
tion charge but is rather designed
to cover the cost of special educa-

ices. Among the items covered by
the fee are certain library‘ books,
which make the purchase of text-
books by the individual unneces-

of lockers and washrooms; regis-
trations and graduation expenses;
and the cost of student health
