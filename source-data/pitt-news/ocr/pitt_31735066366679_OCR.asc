UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Candidates Debate in Dormitories;

By FRED FRANK’
In a series of confrontations in
the dormitories the Student Gov-

 érnment (SG) presidential can-

didates have driven home their
basic campaign promises.

, Mahmood Mamdani, candidate 7
for the Pitt Progressive ‘Party,’

has urged student cooperation on

all issues. A lack of co-operation“

by the student body on vital is-
sues is the basic problem, accord-
ing to Mamdani,-, V -

He pointed. to the “rift” be-
tween SG and The Pitt News as a
case where student organizations
must stop attacking -each other

With new _ state, relation for the
University fast approaching; Mam-
dani feels the SG president must
acquire this co-operation to pro-
tect student rights.  .
Independent candidate Marty
Engels had ‘9"only'one promise—-

Structure  

By DAN Booker: ,
Searching for a new chancellor, the Executive Commit-
tee of the Board of Trustees and a six'member faculty com-
mittee are presently screening a list of approximately 70

men.

“Before any serious conversation can be held,” noted
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, acting chancellor and chairman of

the search group, “we must be
able to answer questions about
the nature of the University’s
state relatedness and internal or-
ganization.” ' .

Dr. Crawford gave no estimate
as to how long it would take to
choose a new chancellor. He did
remark, however, that the search
group will only make recommen-
dations to the Board of Trustees,
who will then make the ﬁnal
decision. , ’

The men under consideration
by the committee were. suggested
by the faculty , and administra-
tion, Very few men apply on
their own behalf, according to
Dr Crawford.

Assisting the search group as
adviser and consultant is Dr.
Deane Malott, president emeri-
tus of Cornell University.

The formal search committee

consists of nine Executive Com- —

mittee members and two ex-of-
ﬁcio and two emeritus members.

the Follansbee Steel Corp., emeri-
tus, and J. Henry O'Neill, Pitts-
burgh attorney, emeritus.

R. Denton, vice-chairman of the
Board of Mellon National Bank
and Trust 00.;-Leon Falk, Jr.,

man.

Other members are Malcolm

' It has been many months since
have turned to that favorite
4 ext of mine “Parables for a Uni-
{versity Student.” As that famed
;day of reckoning for ‘student
eaders fast aproaches, I feel it
"would be ﬁtting .to retell that
“age old fable, “The Chicken Lady
"Who Laid an Egg.” It is impor-
',.tant that this little snip of mirth
be interjected into needlessly
eated times.

" In that petit Gallic village, Ri-
peiidetout, there once existed a
’-clique called the Grossly Glori-
.-jﬁed Guild (GGG). As our sweet
“little tale opens‘ the GGG was
under‘ the malevolent inﬂuence
’ f -the,Terribly Tiring Talkatives
(TTT). If there was one thing
_}’common to all the members of
the TTT, it was that they loved
to hear themselves talk.

, BUT IT was a sad time for the
5 village of Riendetout, for welfare
of the village was intrusted to
«the GGG. And while Riendetout
‘ydeciined, the TTT talked. But the
iimiraculous part of it all was that
 despite the fact that nothing was
_‘ getting done, the villagers didn't
seem too concerned.

 For you see, the T'I'I‘ talked so
well and so long that a combina-

After close appraisal of SG during this past year, a series of salient
actors emerge as requisites for an improved governing body. The M951"
dent must have a broad base of support behind him. He must not only
b,:e"electe'd by a large number of students, but be able to establish a bargain-
‘Eng relationship with the many diverse interest groups on campus. _

' ’ , Another salient factor in the model for a students’ government is the
ability ‘of a president to enact, not react. He must be able to assimilate
various points of view and relate them to specﬁc legislative programs;
lie _must be able to mediate’ and compromise while providing the impetus

Basic changes must be made in the SG structure and an academic
edefinition of jurisdiction. There must be tenets of change, creating a
governmental framework which in itself emphasizes the persistent need

He has stated the need for a’ students’ government which can: (1) recog-

nize student organizations, (2) concern itself with social and academic
policies, (3) deal with equal -effectiveness in involving and working for
all studei/its—engineers, commuters, greeks, nurses, graduate students,
and dorm students. ,

‘ Manning further possesses a balanced perspective. Unlike Engels
wh.o emphasizes his intense involvement in SVG, Manning has been in a
position not only to be acquainted with basic SG operation, but to take an
objective appraisal ofxits place in relation to the entire University. Engels’
primary argument of experience is merely an affirmation of his limited
view; a petty pre-occupation which aided‘ last year’s stagnation.

While the PPP and Eric Stern did present_ “reV01l1ti0I1aI‘Y" id€aS, it
is Manning who can implement any. progressive "measures. Both Mamdani
and Engels can talk and present verbal nicities, but neither can establish
the necessary rapport with the populus; they cannot implement.

lVIanning’s choice of Howard Ainisman as ‘a running mate also re-
flects his balanced perspective and ability to implement. Ainisman is
strong, confident,’ assertive, and- knows parliamentary procedure; he pos-
sesses the strength to run‘a meeting and to re-establish necessary dynam-
ism to the mutilated Vice-Presidency. Even with Ainisman’s drawbacks
of occasional overzealousness, the combination of him with Manning‘ offers
more than Engels and his carbon copy running mate Bill Lerach and Mam-
dani with silent Lois Brady. _ _ h '

A PPP majority would be necessary for Mamdani’s success as SG-
President. A non-critical Senate. would be necessary for Engels to enact
legislation. Manning needs neither; he is made to operate amidst diversity.

Vote for Mahmood Mamdani

Mamdani has proved his quali-

working for a SG that represents

Although he is running with

If the recent poll is indicative’

of campus sentiment, 60 per cent;

of the student body seems to be

undecided as to‘ the relative mer- '

its of the three presidential can-
didates. This is understandable.
Although all three possess merits
qualifying them for Student Gov-
erment (SG) President, each has
his faults.

Representing the ‘Pitt Progres-

sive Party (PPP), Mahmood Mam- .
dani has proven himself an 'elo- "
quent debater _’ and a" capable

member of the Activities Fee
Allocations Cdmmittee. The PPP,
however, represents a radical no-
tion that what it wants is right
and is, therefore, justiﬁed in us-
ing every means, legalsor other-

. wise, to get it. They believe there

is a conspiracy of the administra-
tion against the students. -There
are deﬁnitely policies of the ad-
ministration and faculty which

, are objectionable, but a negative

attitude and an antagonistic, un-
compromising approach Will not

solve the problem. This type of

thinking is alien to mature and

n erac ion W1 the ad-
ministration through’ the Alloca-
tions Committee proves that h

This election is ‘not just for a
President but for a Vice-Presi-

vides the type of harmony that
is needed between o1ficers.a_nd in

ed ,to PPP senators. The results
of such a union will indicate to

By MAHMOOD 
The major reason for a presidential candidate to run
a senatorial slate along with him is that the President

can be most effective when working with a senate ‘that .

*7 agrees with him. This is the ideal situation and this

is what the President should aim‘ for. _

Once_ the Senate has been elected, no matter what
its composition be, it becomes the responsibility of the
President to have consultations with every group in
the Senate, and to, draw up—a1ong with them-—a tenta-
tive blueprint for the year.

The Presidnt must lead the Senate in the realization
of this blueprint. Programs ‘cannot be presented to the
Senate in their infancy. It falls upon the President’s

- shoulders to have his cabinet do all the essential re-
search on a program before presenting it as a bill in
the Senate. . ‘

$1‘; The cabinet should also work with. the senatorial

committees outside the Senate, to formulate the initial

proposals, work out their technicalities, to .have_ 'pro- 

posals ready for presentation in he Senate.

The Senate meetings primarily servethe purpose of
discussing proposed bills or issues of constitutional im-
portance. A case in point is the new constiﬁition that
was discussed, debated,- and amended within the last
few weeks of the Student Government meetings. “

Senatorial committees should be established with the
aid of the Vice-President. The Vice-President becomes

the liason between the President and the Senatorial _ I

committees, just as the President should be the liason
betwen the Student Government and the administration.
The President must also encourage the parties in

mg. The purpose of this would be to discuss the pro-
posals in the caususes and to make the compromises
before the Senate meetings. ‘This will minimize the time
spent in the Senate discussing several points of view.

It can be safely assumed that after the ﬁrst part
of, the term, there will emerge in "the Senate a few
people with outstanding leadership ability.

This chain of communication can not be rigid or for-
mal‘—.the President may often have consultation with
ev§ry_,lSenator on important issues. The communication

5-» lines within Student Government, whether between sen-
ators or with the President and Vice-President, must be
ﬂexible and open. Communication is a vital part of a
workable Student Government. -

, By_ RALPH MANNING

My primary concern,-if elected President,-would be
the creation of a‘mature, responsible, and self-sufficient
students without turning each issue into an excuse for
Senate. By.“mature,” I mean the Senate should strive
to fulﬁll the obligtion of presenting the wishes‘ of the
personal ﬁlibusters or duels between various senators,
as often happened last year.

By .“responsible” I mean the Senate should be able
to put childish, petty pride aside when crucialcauses

demand self-sacriﬁce and the forsaking of personal ..

gloriﬁcation for student good. By “self-sufficient,” I
mean the Senate should decide issues on the basis of
what students want rather than depending upon cues
from party leaders, the administration, or self-seeking
pressure groups. .

If is ﬁne to talk of the above ideal, but I intend to
do much more than talk. To begin with, I will have the
strong and forceful Vice-President necessary to assist
me in the above endeavor. I also hope to have a ﬁne
potential with which to begin to build a strong and uni-
ﬁed Senate -in my SURE senatorial slate. All ‘of these

candidates were chosen for their ability to unite and

integrate their own aims with the desires of the rest of
the Senate toward the common goal of student beneﬁt.

However, it would be naive to assume that even an
entire slate of SURE candidates (if elected) would go
through an entire year Without occasional diﬁerences
of opinion over issues. Here, then, is how I would deal
with any senatorial conﬂicts which might arise.

First, I would attempt to prevent minor differences
between senators or groups of senators from developing
into conﬂict. I would accomplish this through exten-
sive work. by the President_ outside of the meetings. I
would try to determine in advance of the meetings the
positions of the various senators and attempt to resolve
any differences through Presidential mediation, Thus,

the President would act as a buffer between conﬂicting I

senators.

This process, although requiring extensive work by
the President, will beneﬁt the students by resolving con-
frontations outside of Senate meetings. Thus, senators
could avoid six hour meetings which not only waste
their time but delay the passage of vital issues, such
as the planning of Homecoming and the Allocation of
the Activities Fee SG can’t afford another year such
as the last. If I am elected, I will not let it happen.

Last year’s Senate was unable to function success-

tions. These two factions waged war on each otherforf
the entire session of the Senate, and never once Wa O:
last year’s President able to bring them together. on_a'_-
major issue. - - i‘
As an Independent President of Student Gove'rnment,',f
I am determined to avoid a repetition of this destruc-
tive factionalism. I refused to be stigmatized by one
party because I belonged to another, which is why I
chose to run independently. ' I ._
.’ As President, I would not be a member of either
competing group. Whether a SURE or a PPP senator
introduced a bill would make no difference to me. '
The only criterion for my evaluation would be the.‘
merits of that speciﬁc bill. Being independent and 
sponsible solely to the students, I can help the Senate
function most successfully. . _ '
Another improvement that I would make in the Sen-
ate would be the implementation of a workable com-»
mittee system. This enactment would not limit debate
but would allow all opinions to be expressed through-
the proper channels instead of resulting in ineffective-
and unproductive four or ﬁve hour imeetings. _ 
A" more efficient way of handling legislation would.
be to introduce the bill to‘ the Senate in the form of a
ﬁrst reading. The bill should then be sent to committee,
where hearings would be held. Senators, administrators,
studen'ts, and even the non-University community would _’
then be permitted to.testify. .
When the bill is brought back to the Senate, a com- 
mittee‘ report would be sent with it, and, if the com-.

 

the Senate. .

By holding so much of the debate outside the Sen-
ate, Student Government could curtail the wasted hours '
spent there, in addition to increasing the participation
on.the part of the individual senators. Most important, ':
this process enables a wide cross-section of University. .j
students to become involved who can not do so under 
the present system. These committees can only increase ‘
students’ interest in Student Government.  ‘

The most outstanding achievement of a committee__
system, however, would be to move Student Govern‘.-; 7.
ment signiﬁcantly further in the direction of true d__e- 
mocracy, a move that Student Government must make:
if it is to truly represent University students.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Since when has debate become
a. requirement and an asset for a
Student Government presidential
candidate? It seems this year it
has for Marty Engels and Mah-
mood.Mamdani; two of the best
debaters in the school and the
state. I am referring -to last
Thursday’s open forum on WPGH.
It turned out to be , debate be-
tween Engels and Mamdani. Ralph
Manning did the smartest possi-
ble thing by sitting by and let-
ting these two debaters tear at
each other like lions in a circus
side show.

  
    
    
  
    
  
  
   
   
    
  

The position of Student Gov-
ernment president is an- execu-
tive position. The ability to ne- 
gotiate and compromise is the‘
most important part of the job;
Since when has a debater ever v
been taught to compromise? In
a debate each participant wants,
to win his point with no conces- "
sion or compromise. Could ‘you.
imagine a debate between. -the{
Student Government and the ad

ident refusing to concede a point—

e invention of the wheel be-

ery in the driver’s seat. A little
later came the phonograph rec-

duct of man's boundless ingen-
: “canned laughter.” 0
Think of it: now it was possi-
fble to “make people laugh” with-
= out making people laugh, or real-
ly being funny. Television-—itsl
fsituation comedies the perfect ap-
plication _for the new device \-
._ rose to ‘ heights of greatness,
while jealous writers and movie
, producers began to ask “Who
killed comedy?”
, ; The answer, it -appeared, was
that “Death killed comedy.” The
lthought of nuclear confrontation
.changed outlooks from progress
 pink to a cautious yellow; vio-
lence, starvation, and assassina-
ptions bred a new comedy out of
,sick jokes, racial jokes, elephant
‘jokes, and the World War III
joke (“Knock, knock.” “Who’s
there?” No answer.).
V Now we are actively involved
:in solving the problems of the
_late Fifties and early Sixties, or
at least we like to think so. But
‘much of our comedy is still dark.
"Is it that the present reminders
for inevitable death and tragedy
— for every JEK, an Oswald -4
[toughened us into a generally
grimmer family of man?
The pattern holds true in the
‘motion picture ﬁeld where, for
every Tom Jones there is a Dr.
Strangelove, reminding us who
we are, asking where we are go-
ing. And in some of the new
movies it is often difficult to sep-
arate the comic from the deadly
serious, so to speak. The addition
of canned laughter would be a
. valuable cut to today’s audiences,
*who are apparently unsure of
their own sense of humor when
_left to their own perception.
This becomes obvious upon see-
ing two ﬁlms now playing in the
b area, The Loved One —-— at the
"Shadyside—and The Tenth Vic-
, tim——at the Forum. Death is a
central subject in both ﬁlms, and
it seems pertinent to note that
‘both are billed as comedies.

_.;,_'But in The Loved One the si-
lent moments of self-conscious
hesitatioy illst before the audi-
ence laughs comment signiﬁcant-
y—as, significantly as the laugh-
ter itself——upon the uncertain
;_.nature of modern’ comedy. The

   
  
   
 
    
   
   
   
   
  
   

-ﬁlm becomes, therefore, almost

an unintentional satire of Ameri-
can taste — as well as an in-\
tentional satire of American fun-
eral practices-

It is on this latter subject that
The Loved One has received
much of its notoriety (“The Mp-
t_ion Picture with Something to
Offend Everyonel”), since it deals

largely with a young poet’s ﬁrst _

encc. nter with the funeral busi-
ness. And while much of the sa-
tire may be ‘valid, there would_
seem to be little defense for the
ﬁlm's frequent grotesqueness in
the name of “comedy.”

To describe in detail would of-
fend those who have not yet had
the chance to be offended by the
ﬁlm. Wherever subtlety — an
ever-present characteristic of sa-
tire — can be replaced by con-
trived gore, The Loved One —-
comes through with a hideous-
ness that is as funny as—well,
death. '

Thisisnottowriteofftheﬂlm
as one without moments of occa-
sional sparkle. Much of the iso-
lated spooﬁng, especially in some
of the‘ dialogue (“The secret of
social ease in this country is
never to listen when people
talk”), is an accurate observa-
tion of Hollywood society in par-
ticular. But it says nothing new.

And as a satire of the funeral
business it falls short by depict-
ing only this I very same silver
of society which exploits the ex-
clusiveness of a Whispering Glades
type of burial, and is not ex-
ploited by it-

After two viewings, the grotes-
queness in The Loved One seems
less severe, although needlessly
perverse. Considering the cast

etc.) and the director (Tony
Richardson of Tom Jones), and
their true comic potential, the
ﬁlm was a disappointing use of
some of the best talent in show
business._

A more pleasant surprise is The

Tenth Victim, starring Marcello

Mastroianni and Ursula _Andress,_

and what is signiﬁcant here is
that it is perhaps the first come-
dy based on killing. But even its

killing is sanctioned by the gov-

‘ ernment-—is notﬁijantastic enough

death in this picture is Within I

a different context, and is there-
fore comic. This, too, is seen in
audience reaction, which varies
from coldly suspicious to warm.

This absence of laughter —-
even canned laughter —-— may or
may not be indicative of a great-
er skepticism that has “killed”
comedy. It does, however, seem
to. indicate the present mutabil-
ity andgunsureness of individual
taste and sense of humor.

BRINGING UP THE AVERAGE
FOR A CHANGE the NCAA-is on the right track in
trying to control the eligibility of some of the athletes. A
rule was passed prohibitinga man who has a 1.6" average
based on a 4.0 system from competing.
The Ivy League squawked for some reasons of inde-
pendence and freedom of choice as to their athletes eligi-
\ bility. Their gripes may have some validity, but for“ the

Frosh Streakii
At Johnstown

By ROY JACOBS
Generally, when a basket-
ball team defeats a taller op-

ponent by 26 points at a
tough court, the coach is pretty
happy. Such was not freshmen
coach Tim Grgurich’s case after
Monday’s 101-75 victory over
Johnstown. '

“We were fair,” said the coach.
“We played well enough to Win
and that’s it.” He said the team
played in spurts and had good
and bad spells on offense and
defense. “And we gave them
some fast breaks they shouldn’t
have had.” ‘

Grgurich did take some of the

- blame for the offensive mistakes.

With the forwards in a bit of
foul trouble, he removed his
three biggest men and instruct-
ed the smaller team to use an
“open offense.” He meant for
them to move the ball quickly
and score some baskets. They
thought he meant go into a semi-
freeze. As a result of this mis-
understanding, a big lead was
lost midway through the ﬁrst
half.

. The frosh’s main concern be-
fore __the game was Johnstown’s
height. But as it turned out, the
Cubs scored on their big men, led
by Al DiFrischia’s 28 and Len
Kalatafs 23. -,

.l3ut the coach was also quick
to point out that guards made
all that scoring possible with

f their passing. Especially Dave

Welty. Welty contributed 14 as-
sists as well as 17 points, making
him largely responsible for 45
points in the game.

Grgurich was also pleased with
Tony DeLisio’s improvement in,-
working the ball around and
added, “Tony, and Frankie (Cle-

lments) played real good de-

tense.”
