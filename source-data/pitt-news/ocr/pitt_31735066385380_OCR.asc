”The Loudmouth” Morton
Downey, Jr. brought his talk
show to a sold-out David
Lawrence Auditorium last night
to speak about the legalization of
drugs.

The event, sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council, began with
a fifteen minute stand—up come-
dy routine by Downey.

Downey took time to put to
rest any rumors about how much
the Pitt Program Council paid
him to appear at Pitt. The Pitt
News had reported that Downey
was paid $10,000.

”The point is, they’re not pay-
ing me ten thousand bucks;
they’re paying me twelve thou-
sand,” Downey said.

Mort also addressed a group of
six people who were outside pro-
testing the show.

”I understand there’s a group of
six protestors outside. Let's invite
them in right now. Tell them to
come in; they’re part of the fami-
ly. Hell, just because they don't
have nuts doesn't mean they’re
not men,” Downey said.

The protestors declined
Downey’s invitation, but rather
senthim a letter while he was on
stage.

’’I pity those poor protestors

Morton Downey Jr. spoke at the David Lawrence Auditorium. last night‘. However, the controversy surrounding his visit

still lingers (see page 3).

By Sandra Kramer
Staff Writer ,

Three students, Jay Katz,
Scott Garrett and Phillip
Rhoades, organized a petition
in opposition to last night's
visit of Morton Downey Jr.

' ”We’re paying $10,000 at
an institution of higher educa-
tion to see someone who
caters to the lowest mentality
of people,” said Katz.

According to Katz and Gar-
rett, once the petition was or-
ganized, 'they spent several
hours getting signatures in
areas arpund campus, includ-
ing the Cathedral, William Pitt
Union and Second Plate in
Forbes Quad.

”I was surprised at the
response we got,” said Gar-
rett. ”I didn't know that peo-
ple were actually that mad
about Mr. Downey’s visit.
Several professors also signed
and even suggested that we go
and see others who were also
opposed.”

Katz added, ”About 75 to
80 percent of the people we
asked to sign the petition
agreed. Overall, we had

around 269 signatures for
those few hours.”

”If we had continued to stop
people and get their signa-
tures, I’m sure we'd have a
thousand in no time,” said
Garrett. ”However, we only
had a few hours to do so.

”What bothers me most is
the fact that he incites
prejudice in his audiences.
From what I know about his
last visit [at the Syria Mosque],
he had his audience chanting.
His audiences seem to follow
everthing he says. I think he's
dangerous. He represents
everything that's wrong with
our Country.”

Bath students said that the
Pitt Program Council could
have chosen a more respected
person to come to Pitt. Their
suggestions included Nobel
Peace Prize winners or politi-
cal figures such as Barry
Goldwater.

”A lot of our opposition had
to do with the [PPC],” Garrett
said. ”Who decides who
should come to Pitt? Maybe
the process should be more
open to the students. Morton
Downey Jr. does not fall into

Students protest Downey show

the category of speaker or en-
tertainer.”

Both Katz and Garrett agree
that ”Morton DowneyJr. is an
embarrassment to the univer-
sity. His speaking engagement
has no creative or intellectual
value.”

Last night outside David
Lawrence Auditorium, Katz
and other students held signs
protesting the event.

One protester, Althea Azeff,
a Pitt Sophmore said, ”We
need money for very impor-
tant things, social causes. I
don't exactly see how Morton
Downey is going to better any-
one’s social conscience.”

Producer for the Morton
Downey Jr., Jim Langen
offered all protesters free pass-'
es to the event. However, they
refused to accept his invi-
tation.

”When I was in college, ev-
ery person who ever showed
up at our college, somebody
protested,” he said. ."That
keeps everybody honest.
Doesn't bother us at all.”

Greek program designed
to educate Pitt students

By Adam W. Richter

Staff Writer

The two Our Choice programs
this year have brought in au-
diences of over 200 people, and
Interfraternity Council President
Charles Farinella said the pro-
grams will probably get better.

Our Choice, sponsored by the
IFC and the Panhellenic Associ-
ation, stands for Our Concerns
Harboring Over Increased Cam-
pus Education.

It is a program designed to edu-
cate Greeks and all Pitt students
on problems facing college stu-
dents. The first two programs,
dealing with drinking responsibil—
ity and AIDS awareness, were
held Oct. 2 and Nov. 29, respec-
tively. Although it is designed to
educate pledges, the Our Choice
program is open to the entire
university.

Michele Jedlica, president of
Panhel, agreed with Farinella that
the program was successful and
would continue its success.

”It’s a good starting point for
the continuation of the program,"

she said. Jedlica attributed the -

‘ success of Our Choice to the

amount of support from the
university. ”We got great student
and administrative support for
our program.” She also said stu-
dent response was good. ’

”We weren’t asking for any-
thing from anyone except that
they come,” she said.

The Our Choice program was
conceived by Jedlica and Farinel-
la at an IFC-Panhel conference
last year. According to Farinella,
they wanted to bring ”dynamiC”
speakers, such as the ones who
attended the conference, to Pitt
for the benefit of everyone.

Dr. Thomas Goodale spoke on

drinking responsibility, and Dr. A

Richard P. Keeling spoke on
AIDS awareness. Both Farinella
and Jedlica said they thought the
speakers did an excellent Job. ”It
wasn't as if they [the audience]
were being preached to [or]
talked down to,” Jedlica said.

Farinella agreed with Jedlica.
”Few speakers can captivate an
audience, and these speakers did
that,” he said.

Farinella said the present suc-

Israel strengthens relations with the Soviet Union

JERUSALEM (AP) —— Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres said Sun-
day that the Soviet Union’s en-
thusiastic response to Israel's help
in the return of four hijackers has
given ”new significance” to rela-
tions with Moscow.

Peres also noted in a radio in-
terview that Israel agreed to the
speedy return of the hijackers to
the Soviet Union Saturday after
receiving written assurances they
wouldn't face the death penalty.

”The Soviets promised us’ in
writing that these people
wouldn't be- executed, and so
there was no point in delaying or
complicating the process," he
said on Army radio.

The return of the hijackers end-
ed a drama that began Thursday
when four armed Soviets seized
a busload of school-children in
southern Russia, then traded
them for a plane out of the coun-
try and a $3.3 million ransom.
The hijackers surrendered short-
ly after arriving in Israel Friday
evening. ‘

Peres cited the reaction of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, who personally

PPC refuses to release budget and Downey payment

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

Regardless of the controversy
surrounding the payment of Mor-
ton Downey Jr. to speak at Pitt,
the Pitt Program Council refuses
to disclose the official amount of
money given to Downey as well
as their budget’s spending pow-
er. Reliable sources however,
originally told The Pitt News that
Downey’s payment reached ap-
proximately $10,000.

According to Downey, the Pitt
Program Council paid him
$12,000 to speak on the legaliza-
tion of drugs last night in David
Lawrence Auditorium. However,

Tom Misuraca, assistant director
of student activities, said he ”can
neither confirm nor deny” that
amount.

”His speaking fee was not out
of line,” he said. ’’It was very
much in line with speakers of his
popularity if not a little low.”

Lynette Wellington, PPC chair-
person for the event, said disclos-
ing the amount of PPC spending
for the Downey engagement
would hinder contracts with fu-
ture speakers.

’’If I'm going around talking
about prices then I'm not going

to be able to get a good deal,”

she said.
According to Wellington, other

figures considered with Downey
for speaking engagements were
film director Spike Lee, talk show
host Oprah Winfrey and actor
Louis Gossett, Jr.

”We have to go with who's
available and we try to get a lot
of people,” she said. ’’I think right
before exams you need to do a
different kind of program. I think
it's good to do a kind of fun, let-
loose type of program before ex-
ams because it gives people a
chance to unwind and not have
their minds boggled with a lot of
heavy, educational stuf .",

Wellington stressed that all fees
the PPC pays for speakers also

provides percentages for talent
agencies and personal agents in-
volved with the event, ’’It’s not
like we're handing anybody
cash,” she said. ”All the fees are
relative.”

According to Wellington and
Misuraca, all funds available for
PPC contract negotiations are ac-
counted for by a set budget, es-
tablished once a year. The
amount of this budget consists of
30 percent of student activities
fees and profits from previous
PPC sponsored events. The PPC
is prohibited from raising funds
for its organizaton but accepts all
donations. Wellington refused to

disclose the financial amounts

within her budget.

Wellington said that the role of
the PPC is ”to provide a variety
of programs for students whether
they be educational [or] entertain-
ing, that will appeal to a variety
of students.”

Previous PPC events, chaired

‘by Wellington include a lecture

by Gold—Medalist Greg Louganis

and a three day seminar on the

assassination ofJohn F. Kennedy.

everything this semester,” she
said. ”We don't program things

outside,” Downey said. ”I mean,
they don't want anybody to have
freedom of speech unless the
freedom is to agree with what
they say. I understand that. I
mean, I protested when I was in
college. I did all the same sh-t,
but I never was afraid to ap-
proach the person I protested
against.”

Eventually, Downey did ad-
dress his topic: the legalization of
drugs. A six—member panel of
people from the Pittsburgh area

was on hand to debate the issue.

Jack Wojtseck, a therapist at the
House of the Crossroads drug re-
habilitation center; and Dennis
Govachini and Steve Devlin, two
independent drug counselors em-
ployed in Pittsburgh, spoke
against the legalization of drugs.

”We already have enough
problems to deal with right now
with the deficit and the rising
crime rate in the United States tht
it would just complicate matters
for the government and for local
officials throughout the United

States," Govachini said.

The three members of the
panel who were for drug legali-
zation were Larry Demarzo,
another couselor for the House of
the Crossroads; Ron Vassel, a
freshman pre-med student at Pitt
majoring in micro—biology; and
Tracey Hunter, an LIS graduate
student at Pitt.

Downey opened up the discus-
sion, saying that he advocated the
legalization of marijuana, but not
other ”recreational drugs" such
as cocaine and heroine.

Hunter disagreed, saying that
all types of drugs should be
legalized. ‘

”If we legalize drugs, we won't
have that white stuff that's going
around killing people. We'll set
standards,” Hunter said.

”Legalization of drugs makes a
hell of a lot of sense because you
have millions of people... I mean
drugs have been illegalized since
1914 and what the f-ck have they
done -- nothing. There's still peo-
ple taking drugs and there are
massive crime rates and the eco-

nomics behind the legalization of
drugs would be tremendous
also,” said Vassel, who inspired
an offensive chant from the au-
dience nearly every time he
spoke.

After telling Downey to ”shut
the hell up while I'm talking,"
Hunter said that if we don’t legal-
ize drugs, it’s going to wipe out
the community.

After a reception in the William

Pitt Union Ballroom, Downey
headed back to New Jersey.

' PPC overly secretive ,
about Mort’s money Indecent assault taken too lightly

O

Morton Downey Jr. has come and gone from the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh, and the Pitt Program Council has still

steadfastly refused to release exactly how much Mort was -

paid to voice his views.

Mr. Downey even declared to the audience that he was
0 not paid $10,000,a figure“ The Pitt News received from
inside sources, but $12,000. However, Tom Misuraca, as-
sistant director of Student Activities and PPC adviser, will

not confirm this amount.

I It is understandable that not discussing the terms of con-

tracts makes good business sense. On most occasions, stu-
dents do not demand this kind of knowledge. Yet, the PPC

receives 30 percent of the Student Activity Fund, which
is more than $200,000. The students should be considered
. stockholders_in the PPC and thus should be allowed to
know upon request the amounts of money being spent

on all activities.

The SGB receives 50 percent of the Student Activity
Fund. However, unlike the PPC, the organization is
cooperative in disclosing how much money it allocates
to various student organizations. The PPC should think
about following this example.

In a nutshell...

”The real function of a formal education is to teach you
how to educate yourself when you're done with your for-

mal education.”

I am writing in an attempt to
express how angry I feel after
having read about Campus Direc-
tor of Public Safety Walt Waters’
account of ’’alleged indecent as-

.sault” that occurred on Nov. 14

in Forbes Quadrangle. I am also

curious as to why it took two.

weeks for an official recognition
of the incident. E

The statements made by
Waters in The Pitt News indicate
that he is taking the incident light-
Iy - too lightly, and that he has
no understanding of the phe-
nomenon of rape. The article
[said] that, according to Waters,
the woman showed no signs of
physical abuse, that ”the circum-
stances involved are question-
able.” I find it disheartening to
know that our campus director [of
Public Safety] still believes the
myth that a rape is not rape if a
woman is not actually beaten, or
if no weapon was involved.

Waters goes on to state that the
incident has been determined
indecent assault ”because the
woman was allegedly fondled by
her aggressor, but intercourse did
not take place.”  I wonder if
perhaps she saw the ”fondling”
as attempted rape,_ or a threat of
rape. After all, it took a flyer stat-
ing that she had been raped and
knocked unconscious for the
university to acknowledge the in-
cident at all. [...]

LETTERS

One of the three reasons rape
is so often unreported is that
minimal violence is involved.
Robin Warshaw, the author of 
I Never Called it Rape, cites as
one of the seven typical victim
reactions the absence of a strug-
gle. [...] Because you are a man,
Director Waters, you do not live
with the knowledge that any man
can overpower you if he chooses
to, the knowledge that you are
vulnerable.  I know, because I
was raped,_ and I did not have a
single bruise on my body. 

I have a lot of respect for this
unidentified woman for reporting
the incident. Even if there were
no rape, someone obviously vio-
lated her body in some way. 
It sounds as though, since she
wasn't actually raped, she has
nothing to complain about. It is
terrible to have such an ex-
perience played down.  If this
is how an attack in a public stair-
well is treated, I can imagine the
sympathy and assistance that
meet a girl reporting a date or ac-
quaintance rape. [...]

Barbara J. Brooks
Freshman
Mort for a quarter

Hmmmm... so the [Pitt Pro-

gram Council] is paying $10,000
for The Morton Downey Jr. Show
to come here. Well, considering
the fact that [it is] going to make
up half of that amount with tick-
et sales, let's say the net loss is
$5,000. Divide that by roughly
20,000 students who pay into the
Student Activity Fund, and it
works out to about 25 cents each.

So, when the Mort protestors

I shout, ”I don't want my money

going to The Morton Downey Ir.
Show,” do they realize how
stupid they really look protesting
a quarter of ”their” money?
We don't particularly like the
Affordable Floors, but our money
is going toward paying for them
to perform at the Club Con-
course; we don't listen to WPTS,
but our money is going toward
paying their bills; we're not in
[the Gay and Lesbian Alliance],
the BAS or the New Student Net-
work, but our money is going
toward the operation of these
groups. The point is not every-
thing paid for by the Student Ac-
tivity Fund is going to appeal to

everyone’s own political, social, .

or entertainment tastes, and that's
part of life. So quit your [com-
plaining] about Mort and go find
something useful to protest...
maybe 50 cents of your money.

’American—bashing’ becoming a favorite sport of Allies

These days, it's getting harder
and harder to discern friends from
enemies. Five years.ago, Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan referred to
the Soviet Union as the ’’Evil Em-
pire.” He went on to say that the
Soviet Communist Party was

MARIO
OLIVERIO

composed of the biggest batch of
’’looney tunes  since the Third
Reich.” Who would've had a
thought that in 1988, the West's
fiercest Cold Warrior would be
an invited guest in Red Square?

If the American—Soviet agenda
is doing so well, then the United
States must be nearing nirvana
with its allies — guess again. Not
since I can remember has Ameri-
ca suffered such U.S.-bashing
from the biggest bunch of in-
grates since the American colo-
niesin the 18th century. It seems

that the newest international fad
of our allies is complaining about
how evil the United States has be-
come. The~same people who
cried and wept for the starving
children in Ethiopia four years
ago are now suffering from
compassion—fatigue and have
decided to vent their frustrations
against Uncle Sam.

Two weeks ago, Canada was
gearing up for its national elec-
tion. Leading the country’s Liber-
al Party was John Turner, who ran
on an anti-American campaign.
Forget the economic upturn
Canada has experienced under
the conservative Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney; if re-elected, the
Canadian anti-Christ, according
to Turner, would commit the ul-
timate sin ——— signing a U.S.-
Canadian free—trade agreement
which would eventually
eliminate trade barriers over the
next decade. Canada, whined
Turner, would become the Unit-

ed State's .5Ist state, with Mul-
roney as governor. Some people
will say anything to get into
office.

And what about South Korea?
If I didn't know any better, I'd
swear I was watching newsreels
of Iran during the American em-
bassy takeover instead of present-
day Seoul. At least once a week
thereare shots of Korean students
burning American flags, picketing
the American embassy and shout-
ing, ”Yankees go home!” It
seems that the United States is
solely responsible for everything
from the division of Korea down
to the corruption that took place
under the presidency of Chun
Doo Hwan. For some mysterious
reason, the Soviet Union comes
away immaculately where the di-
vision of its country is concerned.

Another crybaby the United
States can do without is the
Philippines. When Andrew Mar-
vell wrote about a ”coy mis-

tress,” he could have had Cory
Aquino in mind. Ever since she
came to power in 1986, she has
been flirting with the idea of oust-
ing the two military bases that
have helped protect her country
since before World War II. Of
course, ifthe Bush administration
sweetens the pot and adds an ad-
ditional billion dollars worth of
economic aid, Aquino could be
persuaded to renew the military
base treaty for another two years.

But the biggest headache
comes from America's ”best
friends” — our NATO partners.
Ever since NATO was created in
1949, the United States has been
getting the shaft. Not only do we
have the additional cost of sta-
tioning our troops overseas in for-
eign countries where the natives
don't like them much, but we
also have had to pay an exorbi-
tant amount of the budget. There
are 16 members in NATO, yet
the United States pays for more

than half the cost to maintain an
alliance that is mainly for Europe-
an benefit.

In 1966 France pulled out of
the military wing of NATO; 20
years later, it refused to grant us
the use its air space when our
planes bombed Libya. Andjust
last year, Spain decided to kick
our F-16 jet—fighter base out of the
country —— only dependable Ita-
ly, which allowed us to use a
base in Sicily, enabled the Unit-

ed States to avert loss of a strat- .

gic military position.

No, our NATO allies don't care
much for the United States, but
I wonder how they would react
if we took Rev. Jackson's advice
and completely pulled out?
Perhaps a good scare from us
would help to change their minds
and positions. With friends like
these...

Mort tells college students what's on his mind

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Morton Downey, /r. was edu-
cated at New York University
and the Boston University Law
School. He received his Ph.D
from the University of California.
After what he called ”successful”
radio shows in Chicago,
Cleveland and Sacremento,
Downey moved to the Sacremen-
to television airwaves. Fourteen
months ago Downey began host-
ing The Morton Downey, Ir.
Show out of station WWOR in
New jersey. Since that time the
show has increased in every au-
dience market by at least one
hundred percent. Last night
Downey went back to school as
he hosted a forum at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. Downey
stopped for a few moments to
talk about education and success.

cess of the Our Choice programs
will last. ’’It’s something that is
going to maintain if not, over a
period of time, get better,” he
said. ”What I hope to see is that

[the pledges] won't mind coming .

back to it as brothers.”

In spite of the fact that many
people participated in Our
Choice, the effectiveness of the
program is something that
Farinella said ”only time will
tell.” However, he said, ”If, of
400 people, 20. people are
reached, that's 20 more people
that we otherwise wouldn't have
reached."

Jedlica is also optimistic about
Our Choice. ”As long as we con-
tinue to get good topics and good
speakers,” she said, ”it will con-
tinue to work.”

Also participating in the Our
Choice program were the Nurs-
ing Student Association, the Stu-
dent Health Advisory Board, the
Resident Student Association and
the American Red Cross.

things that are timely and of in-
terest to students."

Wellinton added that the PPC
provides a ”broad basis” of
events.

Wellington deﬁned Downey as
”an enterntainer.” .

”There are people that don't
like him, think he's a jerk,” she
said. ’’I can think he's the biggest
slime in the world but my job is
to put on a good show.

”Would [students] rather have
their money spent on something
that's going to sell out, going to
be a good show or spend money
and not have a good response?”

Student Government Board
President Craig Jackson support-
ed Wellington's choice of
Downey.

’’I think for what he can bring
in, he's worth the money,” Jack-
son said. ’’I don't see any
problem with the amount [paid to
Downey] or the program itself.”

Q: What type ofadvice would
you give college students about
future paths to success?

A: I would give them no advice
whatsoever, because everyone in
the university is giving them ad-
vice, everyone at home is giving
them advice, all of their potential
employers are giving them ad-
vice. Let them use their own
good common judgement. It will
probably pay off a lot better than
any advice I can give them.

Q: What do you think students
need to be concerned about

today?

A: I think they need to be con-
cerned about the fact that we've
been talking about helping the
poor in this country, the home-
less in this country, the elderly in
this country, the starving in this

country for over 40 years now
and what have we accomplished?
We have more poor, more elder-
ly, more hungry, more people
catastrophically going broke, be-
cause we keep talking about what

we're going to do and we never.

put our money where our mouth
is.

. Q: Why do think you are popu-
lar with college students?

A: My audience is 18 to 34.
What is the appeal? Someone
who isn't afraid to say what he
damn well thinks. Someone
who's not afraid to go out there
and kick some ass. Someone
who's not afraid of losing his job
because he said the wrong thing.
Someone who doesn't give a
damn what some intellectual,

eletist professor thinks, who spent «

his entire career in some ivy-

covered cottage who doesn't
know what the hell is going on
on 125th Street.

Q: Do you consider yourself a
crusader?

A: I consider myself an advo-
cate, certainly. I've been one all
my life. I was one when I was
fighting against the Vietnam War.
I was one when I was protesting
and working for civil rights. So,
yeah, I've always been a
crusader. I was one when I went
to Africa, helping the Africans out
of the country when they were
being blockaded, while all our
great civil rights leaders in this
country couldn't give a damn
about what was going on in Afri-
ca. Now, of course, all we've got
are African-American studies.

Q: Who was your inspiration
when you were growing up?

A: Who was my inspiration?
Jack Kennedy.

Q: Do you have any political
aspirations?

A: No, none whatsoever.

Q: Are you pleased with how.

the show went?

A: Yeah, very. It was a great au-
dience. All I ever ask is that the
people who kick the ass of kids
and students remember how they
feltwhen their ass was being
kicked. Let those professor and
teachers and know-it—a|ls take a
little advice from their students

Sports Editor

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Well, the
1988 Pitt football season is over.

And by the way that the Pan-
thers played in last Saturday's
24-7 loss to Hall of Fame Bowl-
bound Syracuse, it looks like
everybody is happy.

”After we found out that we
weren't going to a bowl game, a
lot of guys took the attitude that
they didn't care,” Pitt quarterback
Darnell Dickerson said. ”They
shouldn't have done that. You
could tell in some of the guys that
they didn’t want to play.

”I wish I would have said
something to them. I figured, why
would they listen to a guy like
me? Now I wish I would have
said somethingsl wish I would
have had the experience of see-
ing guys do that.”

The thing about this game was
that Pitt didn’t start off all that
badly, but it soon regressed into
something that was less than a
game.

”Nobody will ever make me
say that I am disappointed with
this team,” Pitt coach Mike Gott-
fried said. ”I thought we got bet-
ter. We did make some mistakes,
but young teams do that.”

Pitt tailback Curvin Richards
took the opening kickoff 37 yards
to the Pitt 42, and the offense was
ready to move. Dickerson took
control early as Pitt easily moved
the ball down the field.

Nine plays later, on a fourth-
and-one from the goal line, Dick-
erson handed the ball to
Richards. He looked to be over
in the end zone, but dropped the
ball. The referees called it a fum-
ble, and Syracuse recovered on
their own 11-yard line. End of
drive and, for all concerned, end
of game.

”On our initial drive, Richards
looked close to being in, and in
fact, I thought he was in,” Gott-
fried said.

”It’s always disappointing
when you don't get the ball in the
end zone,” Pitt Center Dean
Caliguire said. ”When you move
the ball down the field consistent-

Women outdistance Hokies for Invite title  

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swim team,

proved to be unfriendly hosts, as
they claimed first place in the Pitt
Invitational over the weekend.
Pitt amassed 835.5 points, out-
distancing runner-up Virginia
Tech, who scored 654.5 points.

Virginia, who handed Pitt their
only dual—meet loss of the season
in November, finished third with
647.5 points. Miami of Ohio
finished fourth, followed by Vir-
ginia Commonwealth and West-
minster.

”The team rose to the
challenge,’’ said Pitt coach David
Belowich. ’’I’m very pleased with
how they did. It was a good ef-
fort by everybody; they all did a

ly, get the first downs, it is hard
to get too down. But it still takes
some out of you. When Curvin
fumbled, it was tough to get too
disappointed. Coming off the
field, you had to be happy that
you moved the ball on these
guys. We just thought that we

would have to get them next

time,”

Pitt would have plenty of
chances because of the play of
their defense. They would force
five punts, get one interception
and recover one fumble.

”You know you have to go out
and do your job defensively,” Pitt
cornerback Alonzo Hampton
said. ”It does get a little hard on
the defense when the offense
doesn’t score, but it is up to us to
keep the other team from
scoring.”

Pitt did just that early on. They»
held the Orange to just four plays .
on their first two possessions.
Syracuse punter Cooper Gardiner
(a 51.8—yard average on the day)
sent Pitt deep in their own zone
each time, and the Orange
defense held tough to force a
Panther punt.

Then, late in the first quarter,
Syracuse started to do something.
Fullback Darryl Johnston took the
ball for 20 yards to start the Pitt
downfall.

Two plays later, quarterback
Todd Philcox hit tight end Pat Da-
vis for a 46-yard scoring strike.
The extra point made it 7-0 as the
Carrier Dome sounded close to
exploding.

”That was a play that we put in
during practice this week to take
advantage of their aggressive
pressure defense,” Davis said.
”The corner wasn't there, and the
linebackers were inside.”

Pitt sustained another long
drive at the start of the second
quarter. The offense mixed the
pass and the run to move to the
SU 26-yard line, but were snuffed
there and had to settle for a
33-yard field goal attempt by
Scott Kaplan. It was widelto the
right, and Pitt still had a zero on
the scoreboard.

pened to the offense,” Dickerson

tremendous job."

Belowich added, ”We took
some steps for our future, and it
looks bright.”

Pitt’s Laura Lee Sullivan and
Karin Masal, both freshmen,
broke meet records. Sullivan
swam the 100-meter breaststroke
in 1:05.22, breaking the old
record of 1:05.41 set by Anne
Erikson of West Virginia.

”I’m very happy with my per-

' formance [compared to] where it

is in the season,” said Sullivan.

Masal broke the 200 breast-
stroke meet record with a time of
2:23.24. The old record was
2:23.68, set by Pitt’sJodi O'Neil.

”I was a little behind what I
thought I could’ve [swum],” said
Masal. ”But there was some pret-
ty tough competition, so that

said. ’’It must be a lack of confi-
dence. That's all I can think of.
When we get down deep, things
just start happening. We get the
bad breaks. We just haven't been

pushed me a lot.”

Masal finished second in the
100 breaststroke, and Sullivan
took second in the 200 breast-
stroke.

Pitt led the invitational from the
first event, held Thursday night,
and never looked back. The first
event, the mile swim, featured a
second-place finish by Pitt’s
Theresa Picklo. Picklo, a sopho-
more, swam the tough event in
1 7:28.16.

The scoring was reinforced by
Liz Sari’s third-place finish and
Caroline Day's fifth-place finish.

second-place finish by Pitt’s 200
freestyle relay team. The team
consisted of Laure Walczak,

ert and Celeste Makiel. Virginia

Philcox hit his receivers to
move the offense down the field
during the second quarter. After
a time—out and a 7-yard Michael

Tech won the event.

' Pitt’s 800 freestyle relay team
of Walczak, Rickert, Gallagher
and Picklo also finished secon
behind Virginia Tech. ‘

Gallagher and Walczak also
scored big points for Pitt in the
200 and 100 freestyle events.
Walczak finished third in the 200
and fourth in the 100. Gallagher
took third in the 100 and fourth
in the 200. Picklo also finished
eighth in the 200.

”I swam well enough for
now,” said Gallagher. ’’I hoped
to do a little better, but I'm hap-
py withwhere I am right now.”

Noelle Barry finished fourth in
the 200 butterfly, with a time of

”l’m basically delighted all the
way around; we had some really
good swims,” said Coach Be-
lowich after Friday night’s com-
petition. ”lt’s also extra nice to be
in front.”

Pitt started Saturday night with

time of 5:05.38. Picklo took fifth,
Sari sixth, and Rickert came in
seventh.

Gallagher and Walczak teamed
up again and tied for second in
an. exciting 50 freestyle race.
Their time was 0:24.44; just .11
seconds behind Liz Stretcher of
Virginia.

”l didn't really expect myself to
do that,” said Walczak. ’’I didn't
really know how I was going to
do, but I'm really happy.”

Barry also tied for third in the
100 butterfly event with a time of
0:58.98. Walczak placed eighth
in the event.

The 200 backstroke results
were similar to the 100 back—
stroke results. Atiyeh improved

Walker returns from injury to score

By Scot Ross

Contributing Editor

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — A few
notes on Pitt's 24-7 loss to
Syracuse:

0 The Panthers’ season ended
much like it began + on a long
touchdown run by Adam Walker.

Walker, who lost his job to
Curvin Richards due to injuries,
sprinted 29 yards in the fourth
quarter for Pitt's only touchdown
in their loss at the Carrier Dome.

0 One of Pitt's bright spots this
season was Richards, who moved
up to seventh place on the
NCAA’s all-time freshman rush-
ing list by gaining 72 yards in the
game. His 1,228 yards (for the
year) passed North Carolina's
Amos Lawrence, who racked up
1,211 yards in 1977.

In addition, Richards finished
the year as Pitt's fifth all-time sea-
son rushing leader. The only

‘higher marks on the list were

Tony Dorsett’s '73, '75 and '76
years and Craig ”lronhead” Hey-
ward’s '87 numbers.

Richards’ talents were high-
lighted in an 8-yard run with
13:32 left in the second quarter.
Coming off the line, it appeared
he would get dumped for a loss.
Richards cut back, putting his
head down, and broke through
five Syracuse tackles, only to be
brought down by the sixth man.

0 Flanker Billy Osborn, who
missed his last game at Pitt with
a broken collarbone from the

N.C. State game last week, left his
mark at Pitt as the 11th all-time
receiver by yards (1,104) and
12th on Pitt’s receptions list (77
catches).

°Junior cornerback Alonzo
Hampton failed in his bid to be-
come Pitt's punt-return yardage
leadér. His 26 yards against Syra-
cuse left him 25 short of Gordon
Jones’ 385 in 1985.

PANTHER
NOTEBOOK

0 Carnel Smith led the Pan-
thers’ defense Saturday with 11
tackles. Senior middle lineback-
er Jerry Olsavsky ended his Pitt
career with seven tackles at Syra-
cuse, bringing his team—leading
total to 127.

0 Sophomore quarterback Dar-
nell Dickerson had a disappoint-
ing day in the air, completing 12
of 25 passes for 126 yards with
no touchdowns and two intercep-
tions. He did manage to gain 57
yards rushing and finish the year
as Pitt's No.2 ground gainer with

I 555 yards.

0 Senior free safety Troy
Washington managed two tack-
les to finish third for the year at
Pitt with 70. Burt Grossman,
defensive end, who also played
h_is last game at Pitt Saturday, had
seven tackles and ended up just
ahead of Washington with 71 on
the season.

0 Senior Cornell Holloway
ended terms with Pitt by netting
six tackles, one interception and
one fumble recovery.

0 On the other side of the ball,
Syracuse junior linebackers
David Bavaro and Dan Bucey
grabbed 20 and 18 tackles
respectively.

Punter Cooper Gardiner had a
sensational day with five punts
and a 51.8 average.

Quarterback Todd Philcox end-
ed the year as Syracuse’s highest-
ranked season—pa'ssing percen-
tage leader ever. Don McPherson
held the record previously with
56.9, while Philcox managed a
60.2.

The senior also just missed ty-
ing McPherson’s single season
completion mark, as he finished
one shy of McPherson’s record
142 completions.

Philcox finished his career at

, Syracuse just behind McPherson

in total passing yards and touch-
down passes.

Running back Robert Drum- ,

mond moved past James Brown
on the Syracuse aII—time rushing
list with 2,147 yards in his career.

Orangemen head coach Dick
MacPherson credited good field
position with the success his club
had against Pitt.

He felt that the Panthers would
seem to get something going and
his defense was able to shut them
down. ”What I loved about our
defense was the way they

Lady Panthers wallop American U., 98-61 

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

The Pitt's women's basketball
team racked up their second vic-
tory in a row Saturday afternoon,
annihilating American Universi-
ty 98-61 to improve their record
to 3-1 three days after sneaking
by Penn State at State College.

The Lady Panthers jumped off
to a 16-2 lead and never looked
back against American. Pitt star

, Lorri Johnson once again picked

the team up on her shoulders,

scoring 12 of the points in that

early spurt to lead her team.
From there, the hosts con-

tinued the domination, and when
the halftime buzzer sounded, Pitt
had put up an incredible 67
points on the scoreboard while
shooting a gaudy 66 percent from
the court. To say the least, any ef-
fort American put forth in the sec-
ond half was academic to the fi-
nal outcome of the game.

''It was a high-scoring game,
and I thought we played pretty
well,” Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
said afterward. "The problem for
them was the turnovers. They had
28 — that was 28 extra chances
that we had to score."

Besides Johnson, guard Jennifer
Shingler also contributed heavi-

have an eight-game opening
game winning streak during the
past eight years, and we broke
that.

"That was a great game be-
tween us. The closeness of the
game allowed us to stick with our
game plan. We were able to keep
our poise, and that's the big
thing.”

Despite the back—to-back wins,
however, Bruce still had one of

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Tim Adams and Mike Kozlina
each had a hand in five victories,
enabling Pitt's men's swimming
team to win the 1988 Pitt Swim-
ming and Diving Invitational this
weekend.

Pitt captured the lead after the
second event and never looked
back, rolling up 13 victories in 20
events.

The Panthers easily outscored
second-place Virginia Tech,
1,176-718.5. Virginia, who beat
Pitt in a dual meet two weeks
earlier, was a distant third with
545 points. Also competing were
St. Bonaventure, who finished
fourth with 369; Kenyon, fifth
with 245.5; and Westminster
bringing up the rear with an as-
tounding three points.

— the 200-meter freestyle along
with Scottjeffries and Bill Folger,
the 400 medley with Mark Dom-
broski and John Kesler; and the
400 freestyle with Jeffries and
Folger, which set a new Pitt
record with a time of 3:01.41.
Adams also captured the 50
and 100 freestyle events with
times of 20.96 and 45.50, the lat-
ter setting a meet record.
Kozlina won the 200 freestyle
in 1:39.61, another meet record,
and the 100 backstroke in 51.23,
beating Virginia rival Glenn
Houck by .01 of a second.
Kozlina lost the 200 backstroke
to Houck and also the very next
event, the 100 butterfly, an event
where many were expecting him
to put in an NCAA qualifying cut.
Kozlina was only .30 of a sec-
ond away in the preliminaries but
was a second slower in the finals

because he raced the two events
in a row.

’’It was Mike's choice to swim
in the 200 back, which made him
tired for the fly,” said men's
coach Dick Bradshaw.

’’It definitely slowed me; the
200 back really takes a lot away
from your legs,” said Kozlina.

”My times still have to come
down; I wasn't really going gung-
ho for this meet; at the end of the
year the speed will be there,”
Kozlina added.

Kozlina and Houck both made
NCAA cuts for the 100 back-
stroke during the 400 medley re-
lay, however. ’

Before the meet, Bradshaw said
that he had not expected this to
be a two-team meet between Pitt
and Virginia and had not count-
ed on a strong performance by
Virginia Tech.

Bradshaw, who added that Pitt
was resting prior to the meet
while Virginia was in a training
cycle.

”Sti||, I'm surprised at their lev-
el of competition, compared to
what they did two weeks ago,”
said Bradshaw.

”Virginia Tech is very similar to

said Bradshaw.

Mark Dombroski added two in-

”On the second TD, it was a
regular play we have for aggres-
sive defenses,” Davis said. ”The
corner was at home, but Todd did
a good job getting me the ball.’’

Gottfried saw it a little
differently.

”On the two scoring passes to
the tight end, we had broken as-
signments.”

Orangeman Kevin Greene con-
nected on a 27-yard field goal
late in the third to make it 17-0,
and ‘Pitt looked out of it.

”We self-destructed out there
today,” Gottfried said. ”Syracuse
is a good football team, and they
deserved the year they had.”

Syracuse scored early in the
fourth on a 15-yard Owens run,
and Pitt soon answered with their
only points of the game. Running
back Adam Walker scampered
for 29 yards to make the final
score 24-7.

”We want people to know that
the home of the Dome belongs
to us,” Syracuse coach Dick Mac-
Pherson said.
