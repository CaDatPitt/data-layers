Dental Students Register
For New School Term

Registration at the School of
Dentistry for the current school

‘year was conducted October 4 with

a class of 63 freshmen enrolling.

Although seven of the incoming
freshman class are enrolled in the
Navy V-12 program, the Navy has
announced that this training pro-

‘gram for both dental and medical

students will be discontinued at
the end of the present school term.

6 All students in the undergradu-

ate and graduate schools are asked
to give $2.00. Those who cannot
pay today or tomorrow may pledge
$2.00 and pay later. Pledges must
be fulﬁlled by November 30.

Bills will be sent to those who
make pledges to remind them of
their obligation. Sammy Round,
aided by the YWCA, will be in
charge of the bills.

Chairman Phyllis Krieger said,
“Last year Pitt fulﬁlled 99 per-
cent of its goal. This year, with
wartime conditions continuing on
intopeacetime, money is as essen-
tial as ever. We hope to reach the
100 percent mark. Let’s,cooper-
ate with our student speakers and
back them up with $2.00 from each
of us.”

The student speakers were
chosen by the committee with the
aid of the Dean of Men’s and Dean
of Women’s offices. They have
been trained by Harriet R. Glasser,
J. Frederick Miller, Abbie Wester-
man and Milton Tokash. About 35
professors will speak in their own
classes.

To date, 258 men in Dental
School have contributed a total of
$516 to the War Fund.

From the $2,500 collected last
year, Pitt received approximately
$1,500. Distribution was as fol-
lows: YMCA, $500; Men’s Stu-
dent Loan, $357; WSGA Student
Loan, $354; Medical School Loan
Fund, $41.50; and Pitt in China,
$125.00. The National Fund re-
ceived $525. More than half of
the funds collected at the Univer-
sity remained on campus.

Latecomer Vets To Benefit =

By Accelerated Program

George A. Hoffman, assistant to the dean of men and adviser to
veterans, has announced tentative ﬁgures on veteran enrollment and,
simultaneously, the establishment of a series of short intensive fresh-

man COUISES.

These courses will make it possible for veterans en-

rolling late to complete their ﬁrst semester work quickly and begin
second semester studies at mid-term. I
At present, there are approximately 882 veterans studying at

-Pitt under the “GI Bill of Rights,”¢

many with four and ﬁve years
service to their credit. In releas-
ing this ﬁgure, Mr. Hoffman em-

_ phasized that this is not a com-

plete roll of veterans at Pitt, since
many are paying their own way.
Mr. Hoffman believes that there
are more than 100 such students
and estimates total veteran enroll-
ment at 1,000. Late in October,
when veterans begin enrollinglfor
the intensive freshman courses,
enrollment will be further in-

creased, Mr. Hoffman pointed out.

The ﬁrst of these courses be-
an October 22, with mathemat-

ics 1, 17 and 21» being taught.

These will continue until Novem-
ber 19, when courses will begin in
English 1, history 11, engineering

--drawing 1 and again in mathe-

matics 17 and 21. Beginning Jan-
uary 2, mathematics 1 will again
be offered, along with economics 3.
These’ courses are designed to give

» .i1e,vcl;eran who could not register
0 D  Sqttnber, a chance to “catch-

R .

.2

up” with the rest of the freshman
class and start the second semester
with them. Regular entrance re-
quirements must be met for ad-
mission to these courses.

Mr. Hoffman pointed out that
throughout the fall and winter,
many discharged veterans will be
anxious to start college immedi-
ately. He said he thought Pitt’s
program provided about the best
way for these men to begin with
as little lost time as possible.

ment among the schools includes:

Soph Hop Takes
Place Nov. 10

Co-chairmen Zelima Schmidt
and Helen Reis have announced
the Soph Hop will take place Sat-
urday, November 10, from 9 to
1.2 p. m. High-lighting sophomore
activities, the dan-ce this year is
expected to exceed the attendance
of other years.

The ticket committee will be
headed by co-chairmen Gloria
Harold and Richard Matson. Glenn
Stuart and Mary Carolyn Daum,
heading the publicity committee,
are planning an extensive cam-
paign to stir up student interest.
Program and decorating tasks will
be supervised by Marion Barker.

With enthusiasm, Bernard Puet,
business manager of the dance
asserted, “Get set for the forth-

. coming S-oph Hop. Now that the

war is over, it is expected to be
one of the nicest that the Pitt
students have experienced.”

gate---Qeamwuly

The Pitt United War Fund drive is on once again! And we,
the students, should realize with very little explanation, the
necessity of our contributing to the Fund. In past years we have
given generously, and there should be no excuse this year to be
lax in our donations.

Every dollar collected goes 109 ways. Many_ are the organ-
izations that receive aid to perpetuate and thus, help in the

,work of caring for homeless children, furthering education, and

lessening the burden of other needs that arise.
The total amount of funds needed has increased three thou-

sand dollars over the amount required in last year’s budget. The

reasons -for such an increase (taken from Report of Central Pol-
icy and Budget Committee, August, 1945) are: “In the health
and welfare ﬁelds served by Community Fund agencies, there
has continued to be an aggravation of those problems, other
than economic distress, with which the agencies deal every day.”

“The end of the war and demobilization now taking place
will not bring about any substantial and immediate reduction
in the number of these probems. On the contrary, the process of
reconversion with its resulting labor displacement and economic
readjustment is beginning to throw new loads on the social
agencies of our community/’_

Not only is the money collected for the Fund used for re-
lieving foreign and national domestic problems, but many-of our

own campus organizations such as YMCA, YWCA, the Pitt-.

China Relief Fund, receive direct beneﬁts from the Fund, also.
And so, let us be ready to GIVE today and tomorrow
when we are solicited in our third hour classes. The student who
serves as representative in your room is a volunteer. He is
giving his time and effort to this cause without recompense. Give
him a chance to tell his story. And by your gift, showthat you
understand his appeal. . 1 . ,  

Esau ﬁt /1’/wﬁe/L?

The recent arguments over the atomic bomb, concerned with
what nation should have its control, have overshadowed a few
basic historical facts dating back all of six years ago. In the
summer of 1939 Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Communist
Russia had under the consideration of their separate govern-
ments, plans for the expansion of their spheres by the well
known strong arm method, plans that were causing the world
endless worry. Having already enveloped Austria and Czecho-

slovakia, Nazi Germany was ready to advance further regard-

less of the attitudes of Great Britain, France and the United
States. .

Nazi leader Adolph Hitler gave a diplomatic slap in the
face to the Allies when Germany signed a ten year non-aggres-
sion pact with Soviet Russia in August of 1939, which left his
eastern ﬂank protected and permitted the Nazi blitzkrieg to
storm over Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, while Russian troops
marched in «from the east, obcupying two-ﬁfths of Poland by the
end of the month. Russia lost nothing from the pact with Ger-
many.

While Great Britain and France were preparing to battle
the Nazis, Russian demands were made on Esthovia, Latvia, and
Lithuania, and these small countries disappeared? Similar de-

.mands- were made on Finland and the world knows of the cour-

ageous stand of the Finns against the huge Soviet forces; how-
ever, after a bitter three month struggle, Finland also went un-
der the Soviet strong arm. While the Germans were attacking
France, Russia demanded from Roumania the province of Bes-
sarabia. King Carol had no choice but to cede the territory, and
after a few months German troops occupied the remainder of
his country, forcing Carol into exile, leaving his people behind
under the yoke of oppression.

Does it matter that Russia became an ally of the United
Nations in the crushing of a common enemy? Should the fact
that Russia had followed a policy of aggression before the Ger-
man attack and subsequent defeat, and is now continuing that
same policy in the guise of diplomatic disagreement, bear any
weight towards the foreign policy of the United States? There
can be no trust and faith among the nations of the world as long
as one nation attempts to force its doctrines on other smaller
weaker nations. There can be no harmony between governments
elected by the people, who speak for the people, and govern-
ments controlled by dictators, in which every activity of the
people is controlled by a government agency.

The Allied Nations have successfully brought to a close the
most vicious War in history, and the war began because of force-
ful aggression; so the world battled the tyrant might for almost
six years, leaving behind memories of terror, agony, bloodshed
and hate. The interests of universal democracy do matter now
in the ‘forming of a new and more decent world, composed of

nations free and independent, whose sovereignty will be uncon-

"Sgt. Grace Freund

The law department ﬁnds a lot
of ex-Gls struggling with con-
tracts, torts, Blackstone, etc. Bob
Shortreed and Jim Bowman are
brother legal beagles in that
group. Some of the other boys
have been seen trying a case be-
fore the bar——o-f the Hunt Room.

 

In case some of you ex-GIs have
been wondering why the profs
take _a special check on Veteran’s
attendance, here is the “unofficial”
ofﬁcial answer. Briefly and rough-
ly, the deal is this: The V. A. al-
lows a certain amount of leave
time each month; if the veteran,
through cuts or absence, exceeds
that amount it may be deducted
from his subsistence pay at the
end of the year or at the termina-
tion of his schooling. If his ab-
sence is over an extended. period,
an investigation is started and his
schooling may be terminated as a
result. The safest and least expen-
sive solution is to keep the c-uts
at a minimum.

Graduate Takes Over
Munich Beer Hall

Eleanor Seaver, a graduate of
Pitt’s Retail Training School in
1938, has transformed Hitler’s
famous Munich beer hall into a
canteen for American enlisted
men and ofﬁcers. Mrs. Seaver, a
native of McKeesport, is a club
director with the American Red
Cross and has seen service in
Australia, England, France, and
Germany.

Her husband, Lt. Thomas Seav-
er, was a graduate of Pitt Medical
School in 1941. ‘He was killed in
an automobile accident at Pine-
hurst, North Carolina, on May 16,
1943, while Mrs. Seaver was serv-
ing in Australia.

Pat’ l_McCleary,"th-e good looking
Marine-ette gets credit for this
gag. Someone said that these pep
ralleys were «an upset of prece-
dent. “President~who?” she cooed.

We realize that -Pitt has a na-'

tionality room with the Early
American theme, so this sugges-
tion may be out of order. An
American Room, and American
Memorial Room, dedicated to the
Pitt students of World War II is
our thought. No-t to particularly
honor those who came back but
more _,_resp-ectfully to those who
didn’t. Such .a room might be tem-
porarily arranged as an exhibit
with suitable taste as -a memorial
to the Pitt students who gave their
lives in the late war. Over and
off.

Please Note
Elevator Signs.’

“Don’t believe in signs.” is an
old bromide which seems to have
caused, rather than cured, a head-
ache at the University. Those who
practice this theory have given a
large “king-size” one to our ele-
vator operators. These criminals
get into an elevator (express) and
blithely chirp “Five, please!”——or
even’ “Two!’-’ (Honest!) Others on
the list are those who jump in on
the ground ﬂoor and attemp-t to
sneak off on the ﬁrst.

We realize that life of schol-
astic endeavor undermines the
_health and weakens the muscles-
but don’t forget, boys and girls,
that after you trudge up to the
ﬁrst ﬂoor you may sleep all
through class and rest your weary
selves. Then, too, after you get
used to Walking up the steps: you
hardly ever collapse at the top. So
please, please make an effort to
remember which ﬂoors the cars do
stop on—or, if that’s too great a
burden, look at the sign over the
door before you get in. We are
trying to lower the number of stu-
dents thrown out of thirty-sixth
ﬂoor windows by elevator opera-
tors. With your co-operation, we
are hoping to cut it down to no
more than two or three a week.

afraid, write with conﬁdence, and vote unmolested. In such a
world there will be no more wars; there will be harmony and
trust. There will be a future for peaceful development of com-
ing generations who can say, “It did matter; it wasn’t all in
vain.”

By Burke and Bucher
Ah, me. It’s just one campaign
after another here at Pitt. It was

the YW last week, the United War
Fund today, and tomorrow, guess

what? . . the YMCA starts its
membership drive. Peace, it's
wonderful!

According to our co-author of
this weekly gem, “All bright eyed,
intellectual, and ambitious boys,”
are to sign up for Y membership

at the booth on the ground ﬂoor.

Steve would have written it him-
self, fellows, but he's still recu-
perating from the effects of rush-
ing. ’

Here’s a note (we’re ‘using car-
rier pigeon this week) to all" the
Freshman club lads: there’ll be a
meeting tomorrow with Clark
Shaughnessy speaking on his fav-
orite topic—football. Are we go-
ing to beat Temple? Well natch,
but for the inside dope, come to
Freshman club.

Orchids of the week go to the
new Freshman club cabinet: John
Graziano, Pep Mallinger, Bill
Swanson, Dick Gelm, Glenn Morin,
and Don Zangwill. Nice going
boys, keep it up.

YM, YM, nothing but YM this
week. But here’s a break in the
news. The ﬁrst YM-YW Associa-
tion night is October 26. Here’s a
chance to consolidate those-ahem
——friendships you made during
Hello Week. The occasion is a pic-
nic and barn dance at Hemlock
lodge in North Park. Stag» or
date, come on along all you new
and old Y members.

Last note is a reminder to all
freshman girls, mentors, and
transfer students. Don’t forget the
Caritas ceremony in Heinz chapel
this afternoon. For further infor-
mation, consult our sterling arti-
cle on page one.

Okay, the Y liners are-through
for this week, but all you brand
new Y Members, remember, this
column is for you, too. If there's
anything you want to see in it,
just schedule a conference with
one of the Y liners for some quiet
afternoon. You’1l ﬁnd us any day
in a darkish corner of the ‘Y office
plotting out this opus for next
week.

Until then, this is the Y Liners
signing off. *

Student’s
Stew

By Jeanne Mostoller

There has been quite a bit of
comment going around the campus
about the Cap and Gown show.
“What is it; when will we have
it again?”

Formerly, the Cap and Gown

was presented entirely by the
men students of the University.
T-he ﬁrst production was present-
ed in 1908 under the direction of
Dr. John S. Ashbrook. It was
rather humble and played one
performance, but it planted the
seed for many more succes.sful
Cap and Gown shows, in the com-
ing years. The last show by the
Cap and Gown was given in 1941.
In 1938 the show was directed
by that famous dancing and screen
actor, our own Gene Kelly.
. It‘was discontinued after Pearl
Harbor in 1942 because Pitt, like
all other colleges and universities,
lost her men to the Armed Serv-
ice.

Now, if we have a Cap and
Gown‘ show this year it will be
the students’ doings. Necessary for
its revival are: (1) at least ﬁfty
men to participate in the show,
(2) a deﬁnite plan to tbe submit-
ted to the Cap and Gown Cor-
poration, (3) men who have tal-
ent in acting, directing, and pro-
ducing.

The Corporation is comprised of
alumni of former Cap and Gown
shows and is headed by Theodore
W. Biddle of the Dean of Men’s
office. If the plan is to be accepted
by the group, it must be concrete
and well organized.

The public is also acquainted
withtthe shows. The men were

‘on the road and played in towns

all through the western part of
Pennsylvania. People came from
as far as Ohio and West Virginia
to see Pitt’s men perform.

I-f you are dramatically inclined,
the Cap and Gown has great pos-
sibilities. Many of the men who
actedvand worked on the produc-
tions went on the stage in New

.. York and one reached Hollywood.

Here, men, is your chance to
prove your ability.

The returning veterans, along
withithe talent we already have
here at Pitt, should be able to
cope with this question and really
put on abang-up show. The Pitt
of former years. could do it: let’s

, not be surpassed, you men _of to-
day.

Let’s prove our ability to
both the students and the Cap and
Gown Corporation. Remember, we

‘can have the show if we really

want it!

Mr. Riedl has had a confusing experience.
past year he has been both a student and an instructor at Pitt.

Four Veterans
Return To
Retail School

This year’s -class of the Research
Bureau of Retail Training can
boast of four veterans who have
come to Pitt from places as widely
separated as Canada and Texas.

From Ontario, Canada, has come
Wallace Bryan. Mr. Bryan is here
under the Canadian Government’s
Educational Plan which offers
educational beneﬁts similar to
those offered by our government’s
“GI Bill of Rights.” A graduate
of the School of Business Admin-
istration at Clarkson College,
Potsdam, New York, he enlisted
in the Royal Canadian Air Force
in 1943.

From ‘Pittsburgh comes John
Lewis. A veteran of four years in
the Army, Mr. Lewis entered
service on February 3, 1941, with
the 176 National Guard which
was activated from the Logan
Armory.

Ex-changing military uniform
for more feminine civilian attire
are two women students.

Elizabeth Heckert was Lieuten-
ant Heckert, U. S. Army Nurse,
from May 1943 until April 1945.
A graduate of the Passavant Hos-
pital School of Nursing, during
her servi-ce Miss Heckert was sta-
tioned with the Army Air Forces
in Miami Beach for one year and

_ at Elgin Field, Florida, for anoth-

er year doing relief work in all
parts of the hospital.

From the Lone Star State of
Texas has come Frances Harvey,
formerly Captain in "the Women’s
Army Corps. Miss Harvey receiv-
ed her Bachelor of Arts degree
from Park College, Parkview, Mis-
souri; her Master of Arts degree
in sociology from the University
of Texas; an-d was supervisor of
junior high school and. social
studies at Peru State Teachers
College, Peru, Nebraska, before
entering the WAC. A member of
the ﬁrst ofﬁcers’ candidate class
to be graduated from Ft. Des
Moines, Iowa, on August 29, 1942,
she was then transferred to the
WAC training command at Day-
tona Beach, Florida.

‘Tom Riedl did just that.

In June, 1941, Tom Riedl left
his home in Squirrel Hill for the
Army and by August of the fol-

lowing year, he had completed his
training in the ﬁeld artillery and
was aboard ship, bound for Eng-
land. By November, he had land-
ed in North Africa as part of that
ﬁrst, giant Anglo-American inva-
sion.

When the Nazis capitulated in
North Africa, Sergeant Riedl was-
transferred with the rest of the

American forces to Sicily. When”

ﬁghting was over there, he was
sent on to Italy. It was during the
battle of Cassino, Italy, in Novem-
ber, 1943, that Sergeant Riedl was
wounded in the leg.

‘Due to his wound, Sergeant
Riedl was th n returned to North
Africa for tre tment. He was hos-
pitalized there from November,
1943, to March, 1944, when he was
redeployed to the United States.

By what he calls pure luck, he
was assigned in August, 1944,.as
an assistant instructor in military
science to the Pitt military depart-
ment, Last year, he was coach 9f
the ROTC riﬂe team which won
the intercollegiate championship.
And throughchis combat experi-
ence, Sergeant Riedl was able to
bring many interesting and in-
formative accounts to ROTC men.

If you ask “Sarge” what the
greatest day in his life was, he will
probably tell you August 28, 1945,
for that was the day he was dis-
charged from the Army. Upon
discharge, he was eligible to apply
for admission to Pitt under the
GI Bill of Rights. He is study-
ing business administration.

Asked how it felt to be a stu- .

dent, “Sarge” said: “It feels won-
derful, but it’s sort of roug .”

And how does he like being
called “Sarge”? “I don’t mind it
at all. I’m so used to it. I’d feel
funny if they didn’t call me that.
I guess hardly anybody knows my
name, anyway.” .

Good luck, “Sarge.”

Pitt Host To Delegates

western Pennsylvania will be

Blond ‘Connie’

  Liked It

By Betsy McCre-ary

A Pitt now has thirteen veterans
coming from all branches of the
service, Waves, WACS, Spars, and
the Marine Corp Women’s Re-
serve. One of these is Constance
C. Rogers who has been in Coast
Guard for twenty-nine months.
Taking h-er boot training at Palm
Bea-ch, Florida, she was later sta-
tioned at Baltimore, Norfolk, New
York, and Philadelphia. She en-
listed as an Apprentice Seaman
an-d was discharged as a Yoeman,
First Class.

At Baltimore blond, blue-eyed
“Connie” worked at the Merchant
Marine hearing unit. This unit
dealt with Merchant Seaman ac-
tivities, casualty and collision in-
vestigations. This work ﬁt right in
with the law course she is studying
at Pitt.

Before enlisting in June of‘ 1943
“Connie” took some night classes
at Pitt. She wa.s discharged Sep-
tember 19 just in time to start
with a full schedule at Pitt.

Constance says that the reason
she joined. the ‘Spars was that she
has a kid brother in the Coast
Guard—but, she has one in the
Army, too. .

While stationed in Baltimore,
1lVLd., “Connie” found time to work
as a Red Cros-s Volunteer Nurses’
Aide at Union -Memorial hospital.
She also did volunteer work at the
Red Cross Blood bank_ two nights
-a week for ‘fourteen months.

Marian Rhodes

WAVE Veteran
Enrolls at Pitt

Marian Rhodes, Aviation Ma-
chinists Mate second class, dis-
charged from the WAVES on Sep-
tember 21, has enrolled as a fresh-
man. She expects to complete a
full four year course in the School
of Business Administration.

Marian was at the ﬁrst boot
camp at Cedar Falls, Iowa, and for
a while modeled for Uncle Sam’s
WAVE recruiting campaigns. She
worked on Gruman Torpedo
Bombers as an Aviation Mechanic
at Miami, Florida, naval air sta-
tion and took advantage of her off
duty hours to enjoy her favorite
pastime, swimming.

Before joining the service Ma-
rian was employed at the Beaver,
Pa., swimming pool as a life-
guard, a job to which she intends
to return during the summer.

Standing ﬁve foot ﬁve inches at
120 pounds with brown hair and
green eyes, the sailor-girl accu-
mulated 29 points from 33' months
of service. At Pitt under the G.I.
Bill of Rights, Marian plans to en-
ter several extra—curricular ac-
tivities, perhaps the Veterans’
Club.

In answer to the question of how
the WAVES feel about civilian
girls not being in the service,

HARRY JAMES
11:60 P. M.
.. Carnival

This is one of James’ newest
numbers sung by Kitty Kallen in
an amiable way. Harry -plays a
solid solo with an unintentional
amusing background. On the re-
verse side James plays one of his
ﬁnest solos while the violins play
a tricky backdrop. The entire ar-
rangement is solid except for a
short trombone solo. The tempo
changes later giving the tenor a
solo for about -eight bars. All in
all, this is one of James’ best discs.
(Columbia 3648127.)

FRANK SINATRA
I Should Care
When Your Lover Has Gone_

A slow moving song sung by
Frank in his usual phrasing style.
This record was made with an
orchestra ‘under the direction of
Axel Stordahl. The other side,
When Your Lover Has Gone, is a
better song. Backed by Axel’s
tasteful strings and woodwind
scoring, it is lavish1y- done since
Frank also sounds to ad.va.ntage.
(Columbia 36791.)

WOODY HERMAN
Northwest Passage
June Comes Around Every Year
As on other records of Woody’s,
the trumpet section‘ wins honors-—
even from the rythym section and
the soloists. The trumpet players
this "time were Sonny Berman,
Ray Wetzel, C. Frankhauser, Pete
Condoli, and Conti Condoli. The
trombone sedtion shin-es while the
wild {brass plays. Solos are by
Burns on piano, Marge Hyams on
cibes, Joe Phillips on tenor,
Woody on clarinet, and Harris on
trombone. June has swell muted
brass work. W oody’s solo is not as
good as usual. Burns plays a good
piano background. (Columbia
36835.) »

TOMMY DORSEY
That’s It
Nevada

That’s It——is certainly it. Charlie
Shavers -plays an excellent trum-
pet while Vi-do, Musso plays a
tenor solo. This is one of Dorsey’s
best jazz offerings in a long time.
Shavers’ trumpet solo is one of
the best recorded in a long time
by any member of any band. Stu-
art Foster an-d the Sentimentalists
sing Nevada.

SERVICE UNEXCELLED

By Ursula

We should have gobs of news
this week considering the Notre
Dame game and men’s rushing,
but Monday morning d-awned——
no news —— ten minutes before
deadline—no news. Here’s what
we got from the last minute tap-
ping of the grapevine.

We tried like mad to get some
off-the—records from Psi Omega
this week, but although we saw
them at the Notre Dame game and
later at a big boomin’ picnic, they
claimed to have had a “very quiet”
week-end. Caught a glimpse of
them ﬂoating from aisle to aisle in
the Stadium however.

Here’s something for the annals
of rushing history. Fiji prexy Ted
McCurdy took time out on Satur-
day night to give his pin to Kappa
Mary Lou S-tickle.

Mystery surrounds the why and
wherefore of Mary Lou McFall
who arrived at the Phi Gam house
‘Saturday night with Scotty Mar-
tin. Art Petsinger was not present.
A triangle brewing, no doubt.

Jack Scoﬁeld gave Pitt women
competition at rushing dances by
d-ating some blond modelling ma-
terial that really caught the eye.
Tell us, Jackson, do Kaufmann’s
girls really have S. A.?

Followed Doc Lambert around
all evening watching him and
Jean Voegele (Maryland College).
They were “clear out.”

We understand that there was
quite «a party at the home of Bet-
ty Lou -Hillegas last Saturday Nite.
Witnesses relate that the Army
Air Corps plus the Navy demon-
strated very effectively the value
of “combined -operations”.

Patty Woods seems to be con-
ﬁrming her Saturday night dates

ager. '

every two weeks throughoutthe
entire school year. Senior Court
is eager to have every student who
is interested attend these chats.

To receive an invitation, stu-
dents should sign their names in

 Strip

  Seen As Aid

In Education

Do you read the funnies? Are
you a connoisseur of comics? Well,
if you are, you can take that
sheepish look off your physiog-
nomy while you’re reading them-
for lo and behold the lowly comic
strip is ﬁnally coming into its
own. Educators now predict that
comics will become more and
more valuable as sources of edu-
cation and instruction. Their value
lies in the fact that they convey
ideas with a minimum of effort
on the reader’s part. Our own
Dr. W. W. '-D. Sones of the School
of Education is a leading advo-
cate of comic strips a-s education-
al aids. and serves as an advisory

editor for Superman Publications,
Incorporated.

Of course, everyone has a slight-
ly different slant in regard to the
funnies an-d here at school an in-
formal campus poll garnered the
following results:

A1 Roth seems to favor that
school of thought which considers
the comics childish. He comment-
ed, “I don’t read them except for
Dick Tracy and h-e’s a carry-over
from childhood.” On the other
hand Marian McCormick, a teach-
er to be, expressed her views in
the following fashion, “I think
that many of the current comic
strips rather accurately reﬂect
present day life and in this way
help give one’ an insight into con-
temporary conditions.”

Lewis Myers seems to doubt
the educational beneﬁts however
for as he explains, “Brenda Breeze
certainly takes my mind off my
studies. She’s soooo relaxing.”
Jean Donﬁeld suggests an im-
provement. “Personally,” she said,

“‘I think it’s about time they let

Little Orphan Annie grow up, ac-

bquire some boy-friends, and slip

into a few. clingy dresses.” We
second that motion, Jean.

Do You Know The Purpose
Of Business Research?

By Marion Barkan

The Bureau of Business Research is a division of the University
that students and faculty seem to know little about.

The purpose of this department is to keep the business men and
large industries in Pittsburgh well informed on the curve of the
markets and amount of business done weekly and monthly in our

city.

In order to send out this information, the Bureau publishes the

Weekly Index of Business Activity’

in the Pittsburgh District, which
includes a summary of the level
of business in Pittsburgh. They
also send out two monthly publi-
cations. A two-paged Survey of
Business Prospects is sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Chamber of Com-
merce. This paper deals. with op-
erations of ﬁrms and new orders
and deliveries. The third publica-
tion is an eight-page magazine
called Pittsburgh Business Review.
This is. a monthly summary of
business and economic conditions
in the Pittsburgh district. Some
of the items considered in the
Review are employment, payroll,
changes in business, production,
trade, transportation, real estate,
construction, ﬁnancial conditions,
prices, and cost of living.

So you see the Work is not only
interesting ‘but of great import-
ance to business people, import-
ant not only to Pittslburghers but
to the whole world. Besides send-
ing the publications. to many cities
in. the United States, the Bureau
sends them to England, India,
Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and other
foreign countries.

The Bureau, located on the
twenty-first ﬂoor, has a large re-
search library. Not only do they
have books, but pamphlets from
all over the world. This is not
their only source. They receive in-
formationand statistics from the
United States Bureau of Census,
Pennsylvania Department of La-
bor and Industry, United States
Bureau of Labor and Statistics,
United States Bureau of Mines,
and manufacturers and business
men in Pittsburgh.

The director of the Bureau is
J. P. Watson.

In a closer game than the 39-9
score indicates the Pitt Panthers

-rfell before the 1945 edition of the

“Fightin’ Irish,” Saturday. At the
end of three quarters. it was still
any1body’s ball game, but the Irish
commenced to pour it on during
the ﬁnal period. Fighting every
inch of the way, the Panthers
conceded nothing to their much
publicized foe. V

The entire Pitt line performed
heroically and special mention

‘should be given John Kosh who

was carried out twice before he
called it a day at the doctors in-
sistence. The broken ﬁeld running
of Jimmy Joe Robinson was some-
thing to behold and he brought
the large crowd to its feet more
than once. _

‘The Pitt -pass. defense again
proved vulnerable and “Boley”
Dancewicz took advantage of this
ﬂaw.‘ ‘He was the outstanding

South Bender on the ﬁeld both on
offense and d-efense. Along with
Dancewicz, ‘the Irish right hal-f-
back, Angsman, proved his grid-
iron ability to the throng.

Temple Yet To Stop Cats

Wednesday, A October   ;

Local Line-u p Remains Same

By Al Roth
Owls don’t always _come out at night. At least not the Owls
of Temple University who will swoop down upon Pitt Stadium
Saturday afternoon toeengage the University of Pittsburgh in a
gridiron clash. The Templars, thus far undefeated, have played

all their previous contests on Friday under the arc lights.

The

visitors,.who are under the guidance of Ray Morrison, ex Van-
derbilt grid captain, and his two able helpers, Josh Cody and

Josh Williams of Pitt backﬁeld 9

fame, are aiming for their ﬁrst un-
defeated season. Last. season Tem-
ple ‘ﬁnished with two wins, two
ties, and lost four, while this year,
the Templemen, after sliding past
Syracuse 7-6, have ' conquered
NYU, Bucknell, and West Virginia.
In doing this, they have «amassed
the astronomical total o-f 150
points while having their own de-
fenses punctured by‘ only three
thrusts over the goal, two coming
in last week’s West Va. tilt. Tem-
ple and Pitt have met twice before
with the results in favor of the
Panthers both times, iPitt’s famed
“dream backﬁeld” rolled up a 28-
6 decision in 1938 and Charlie
Bowser’s ﬁrst Pitt club followed
up with a 13-7 victory in ’39.
The Philadelphia eleven is a
rather well-balancedl group with
a starting line that passes. well

-start any number of combinations
without weakening his squad to
any degree. The Templars may
line up with two of the loftiest
ends found on any college roster,
they being Jack .Hewson and Carl-
ton Elliot a pair of inexperienced

hands who have" been behaving
like seasoned vets. Hewson is also
a Temple court star and is 6.6
while Elliot stands a mere 6.4. The
Owls will throw two husky tackles
into the battle, Mark Dolin of At-
lantic City, N. J. and George
Waltzer, a Marine vet who don-
ned football togs for the ﬁrst time
in ten years at the tail end of last
season. The guards will be John
Piscitella and Ed. Virshup. Mentor
Morrison has been loud and long
in his praises of Virshup who is
considered the best all-around
performer on the squad. Senior
Mort Hochheiser is a dependable
defender of the pivot s-pot. The
probable kick-off backﬁeld would
pit Jack Burns Q. -B., Jimmy Wil-
son’ L. H., Gene Zawoiski R. H.,
and 190—poundi freshmen Chet Or-
seck in the tailback, against the
Panthers.

Sports Editor

“We gambled on Saturday and lost,” sums up Notre Dame’s 39 to

9 victory concisely and to the point.

It was a known fact that a so-

called miracle would have to occur on Saturday for Pitt to come out

of the battle the victor.

It’s granted Notre Dame ﬁelded the weakest

team in three years, but don’t let anyone tell you that our players and

coaches didn’t try their darn best.

But it still takes big time material

to defeat a big time team and keep up a big time schedule like Pitt

is playing.
Strategy Fails

If at any time 65,000 fans left a
football game disguested, it was
Saturday. The fans didn’t appre-

vci-ate Coach Shaughnessy’s strate-

gy of sending in substitutes each
time the ball changed hands. In
a baseball game when a manager
pulls out his star slugger and
places in a pinch hitter he is prac-
tically “booed” out of the park,
but if that pinch hitter comes
through with a base hit the fans
call him a real ﬁeld general. We
can place Shaughnessy in the same
position. He was pulling his
punches in the same position. He
was_ pulling his punches against
Notre Dame. If the substitute had
carried in a play that produced a
touchdown the fans couldn’t have
yelled praises loud enough and if
a defensive sub had made a sensa-
tional tackle of an Irishman in
the clear and on the way to 'a
touchdown, another great ovation
would have blurted forth. The
game is over. We lost. Shaugh-
nessy tried. The boys tried. In
‘fact that ﬁrst half the Pitt squad
played the best football thus far
this season.

The Pittsburgh papers last week
opened an attack on Clark Shaugh-
nessy, Pitt football coach and

A
V

Washington Redskin advisor. It
seems as though Mr. Shaughnessy
is dividing his time between the
Pitt campus and the Capitol City,
supplying the Redskins with a
stock of T formation plays. The
match that lit the ﬁrecracker was
the Michigan State loss, then the
following day Mr. Shaughnessy is
seen in a top tier Forbes Field box
with a portable phone relaying in-
formation to the Redskin’s coach.
Mr. Shaughnessy, our loss to
Notre Dame is over and nothing
more can be done, but plenty more
can be said.

Public Relations Poor

As far as Pitt sport’s publicity is
concerned, it’s at a low time ebb.
Out of town newspapers just
don’t know what a piece of Pitt
publicity looks like. Recently Mr.
Hagan decided to give the down-
town newspapers a break and hold
weekly press conferences at the
Athletic Club, but that doesn’t do
the out of town papers any good.
Then Mr. Shaughnessy orders a
guard at the dressing room door,
not with orders to permit any re-
porters from the Pittsburgh Press
to enter. Even though we lost and
despite the riding they have been
giving him is no reason why the
Press shouldn’t be admitted.

Meet the Team

This week we’re going to take a look at the 205 pounds on each
side of Pitt’s center—meaning of course, the two star. guards, Fran

Mattioli and George Ranii.

In this pair, Pitt has two of the ﬁnest

lineman in the state, and they are two of the biggest reasons why
Pitt’s opponents take to the air so much. The main functions of a
guard are blocking and tackling and anyone who has ever seen Fran
and George in action will know they have done plenty of both.

 

Fran, a Navy dental student in
his senior year, has been with the
Pitt squad for four years, and each
year he adds just a little more
strength to that left guard posi-
tion. Weighing 205 pounds and
standing 5 feet 10 inches, he is
quite capable of ﬁlling his spot on
the line, but back at Har-Brack
High he wasn’t quite so big, and
for the year he played he was at
quarterback position. Last year
Fran hurt his back in the Bethany
game and was unable to play for

 

the remainder of the season.

George, a freshman in Dental
school, has been regular right
guard for three years now. His
205 pounds were just as useful to
him back at Aspinwall High where
he played tackle for two years.
The Aspinwall eleven was very
close to winning the Class B cham-
pionship then, but a tie in the last
tussle threw it out of the running.
For his outstanding playing last
season, George was picked to play
in the East-West game.

Carlson Boasts

Tallest Squad

Since Pre-War

If ‘there is any foundation to
the old basketball adage that

“height makes might,” Pitt’s floor »

fortunes may fall i.nto the Win-
’em All category when the 1945-6
trail unwinds.

Among the 29 court candidates
who have been battering the
boards in nightly sessions in the
Pitt Stadium gym are at least 13
sharpshooters who can stretch the
tape s.ix feet.

Three of the holdover letter-

men are in the second—‘story class, '

Hank Zellers, Ed -Garnhaml, and
Jake J aco-bson all -going above the
six—footlmark. ‘Then there are a
flock of freshmen who will ‘be
able to take up any possible slack
in the height departmen.t.

If there should emerge from
this pack a few tall passers who
will be able to spell -off the small-

er operators, Doc Carlson may not A

be the only one “looking up” to
the Panthers.

Only six weeks remain before
the opener with Ohio State at
Columbus on December 8. There
weeks. have been consumed in
laying the foundation, so ‘intra-
club games will start next week.

It’s now time to go all-out with
the pumpkin faces, spooky masks,
taffy apples, corn candy, etc., mak-
ing us think of——you guessed it-
Halloween! Of course, being col-

"lege students (ahem!) we must re-

strain ourselves (or -at least try to)
from ringing doorbells and chalk-
ing windows. But since the spirit
still goes on, my kid brother has
offered to take over for me this
year.

To carry out our theme——the
Chi 0’s are having a Halloween
Dance at their house this Satur-
day. The girls were the guests of
Tech’s Delt fraternity, last Satur-
d.ay—+M«aybe 'that’s where they
met some of their “Halloween
dates”? '

Not to be outdone, the Zetas are
also having an “orange and
black” dance on Friday night. The
girls held a house dance for the
Phi Gains on Monday.

IBut competition is keen, for
Mary Vas-ilvakis is chairman of the
Beta Sig Halloween Dance On this
same Friday night. Me thinks some
of these guys are gonna be kinda
conceited-—with two bids for the

, same night. May the best gal win!

The TPA’s held a Tea Dance for
the Phi Kaps last Wednesday.

‘ The gal’s eventful week also in-

cluded their annual Parent Party
where all the Ma’s and Pa’s of
TPA had a gay time!

Have you been a “victim” of a
green ticket thrust into your hands
by a Phi Sig? You’re Lucky! This
is your admission to the Phi Sigma.
Sigma Dessert-Bridge at the
Schenley Hotel‘ -on Sunday, No-
vember 4. Proceeds are being
given to our own ‘Twelfth ﬂoor Of
Pitt. Wonderful idea!

The Delta Zeta’s will sport pink
and green ribbons under their
pins today in honor of Founders
Day. This ‘Saturday the sorors will
hold a Founders’ Day Banquet at
their house. District D Z alumnae
will be present. _

Nollie Ramsey is -chairman of
the Tri Delt House-Dance on No-
vember 3. There’s still time to, be
asked, fellas!

A E Phi are having Open-House
after the Temple game, until 62.00.
All are invited, with the exception
of Freshman women. (Rushing
rules, you know.)

The Theta’s «also extend us an
invitation to attend their open-
house after the Temple victor)’
(we hope!). Again, 1

.Wednesday, October 24, 1945

By Marty Wekselman

The end of the big rush ﬁnds
frat men in various stages of re-
covery from exhaustion. After
closing Pitt’s gala opening of post
war rushing, all loyal fraters are
explaining away class cuts, be-
tween rubs at still droopy eyes.
Needless to say, Pitt’s ﬁrst’ peace
time rush in several years came
off in grand style; now, as a re-
ward, the boys are getting back
to the social calendar. Incident-
ally, the APHia’s (Alpha Phi
Alpha, who haven’t been heard
from previously) got back into the
swing of things last week—end with
some fine affairs for their rushees.

Several frats will honor their
new pledges in affairs this week
end. The Phi Ep’s fete their new-
est additions at a stag Friday
night, while the Phi Delt’s accom-
plish the same results at a dinner
dance on Saturday. Further down
Dithridge Street, the Pi Lam’s
welcome newcomers with a mas-
querade ball, also this Saturday.
The Delt’s will usher in Halloween
with a dance Saturday, and, in
addition, announce a dance with
the Theta’s on the thirty-ﬁrst.

Our side scores in the romance
column once again, with the
Sigma Chi word that Jim Ar-
mour’s pin is now worn by Cath-
erine Gross. Joy and sorrow are,
however, unfortunately mixed this
week, as the SAE’s mourn the
passing of Chuck Fusco.

The big guns in the service cor-
ner this week are the PiKA’s, who
announce no fewer than four dis-
charges. George Hauker, Ben Gil-
patrick, Fred Bey, and Dick Brock
are the lucky lads. The Phi Kap’s
were also made happy by the re-
turn of Larry Burwinkel, even if
it was only for a few days. Re-
turning to school after a long siege
of illness, is Phi Gam Les Sarles.
Les arrived just in time to attend
a dance for the ZTA’s last Mon-
day.

Fraternities in general wish to
announce that any bumps and
bruises noticeable on their re-
spective men, during the next few

weeks, are results of I. F. foot- 7

ball comptition, and not produce
strike riots.

Those howls .of anguish and
screams of mortiﬁcation that have
been issuing from the Dean of
Women’s Office are not due to
physical maltreatment. The of-
ﬁce has not resorted to corporal
punishment to keep unruly women
students in line.

All the mental torment and
furor was caused by the releasing
of their 1. D. (identiﬁcation) pic-
tures to women students. Once
Pitt coeds were gay, carefree, and
self-conﬁdent, but the I. D. pic-
tures dragged them into the dol-

‘ drums.

Bedraggled and weary, defeated
by a thousand arrows of registra-
tion misfortune, the coeds were
forced to suffer the indignity of
braving the camera’s truthful eye.
Engraved for future reference,
were the tired faces, almost be-
reft of make-up, and the stringy
hair that was once carefully
coiﬁed, devoid of curl.

When the coed I. D. pictures
were released, questions were
raised by the discerning Pitt men,
as to when the owners would be
discharged from the institution in
which they were serving time.

However, coeds will have their
revenge, for the boys’ I. D. pic-
tures now have been released.
