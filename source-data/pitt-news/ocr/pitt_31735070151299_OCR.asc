In a little more than a week, an
online petition to change the Uni-
versity’s email service collected
nearly 10,000 signatures from
members of the Pitt community.

Student Government Board

President Gordon Louderback in-
troduced the resolution — which
listsjudicial Chairmanjoe Kozak

and all ‘eight Board membersas M

co-sponsors — last week, and
the Board unanimously voted to
urge the University to introduce
Google’s Gmail platform to its

email service. The Board — re-

The Board argues that the use of Google
applications, which allows for the sharing
of documents,—— will create an oppor-
tunity for more effective collaboration
between students, faculty and staff.

The resolution claims that “Google
Apps for Education is a more efficient,
cost—effective and user-friendly option
than the current University email plat-
form.” A

statement Google released after the maga-
zine published this year’s rankings last
week. ~

The resolution has been a joint effort
between SGB and Google Student Ambas-
sador Zach Alcorn, a Pitt senior.

Alcorn operates as a liaison between
Google, the University and its students.
Alcorn contacted Louderback two weeks
ago to initiate discussions about the switch
to Google Apps for Education.

Louderback and Alcorn met before
drafting an online petition to persuade
the University to switch to the Google op-
erating system. The petition began to col-
lect signatures from students and'faculty
supporting the change after it was posted
online Sept. 9. ’ .

PALLIGRAPH

 

Elegant, eloquent students propose

constitutional amendment to ban requirements

Rohith Palli
Columnist

Disclaimer: The author has read
neither “Atlas Shrugged” nor the
entirety of “The Wealth of Na-
tions,” but hopes that readers
derive pleasure from this most
excellent worldview that has been
presented. Additionally, the “stu-
dents” he spoke to aren’t really
people, so don’t search for them
on Pitt Peopleﬁnder like we all do
at The Pitt News. _ T
We all encounter deadlines
at times, but they run counter
to everything a certain group of
disconnected students believes.
Because of the negative stigma
attached to students who belong
to this deadline-averse, often-
labeled irresponsible category
of procrastinators, it was difﬁ—
cult to contact students for com-
ment, but I nonetheless present
here their perspective thatall re-
quirements, especially deadlines,
V should not exist.

I asked Ran Pawl, a sophomore
biology and psychology major,
who refers to himself as pre-med,
what college is like for students
who are allergic to requirements,
and he replied, “Not only do due
dates force us to be productive,
but they also force us to complete
projects ina set time frame. In the
real world, people do whatever
they feel like doing. If teachers
cared about preparing us for the
ideal world, they would never ask
us to do things we didn’t want to
do.”

For studentsllike Pawl, Ayn '

Rand serves as an inspiration. In
her novels “Atlas Shrugged” and
“The Fountainhead,” she suggests
that the ideal human society is
one in which individuals acts
precisely as they were created to
and only in ways that bring them
pleasure. Rand, a sometimes—so-
phisticated thinker, summarized
her work aptly in saying that “al-
truism is the ultimate evil in the
world; helping others is for the
weak of heart.” ’

But if it’s pointless to be al-
truistic, what should our goals
be? And, as college students, how
should we pursue them?

Nadia~.Verita, a sophomore
anthropology major, suggested
the answer to these questions:
“We should all strive to be true
entrepreneurs. It is critical we dis-
cover our very narrow passions,
employ them to proﬁt and build
our material wealth. To this end,
we must not dither in the center
with liberal arts, but rather, focus
ourselves on career—preparation
regimens, boxing out extra-career
curiosity as much and as early as
possible.” _

When asked for theory to
back their declarations, several
students immediately quoted
Adam Smith: “Every individual
is continually exerting himself to
ﬁnd out the most advantageous
employment for whatever capital
he can command. It is his own

advantage, indeed, and not that

of the society which he has in view. But
the study of his own advantage naturally,
or rather necessarily, leads him to prefer
that employment which is most advanta-
geous to society.”

Hence, we have it on good authority
that the only greater good comes from the

individuals pursuing their own‘ inter€§'sfs:"’

Thus, we must have faith in the invisible
hand. As Verita is apt to say, “It is__;like the
ﬂying spaghetti monster .— something
worth believing in.”

When asked why there amt’; large ;
movement to reshape ouriiworld, Justin’ .

Solitaire, a junior studying philosophy,

responded, “I think there are lots more ,
students out there that share my opin-,

ions, but since we don’t believe insetting

requirements, no one has attempted to I
form a group. There would need to be some , "

deciding quality that defined the cohesive
whole, whether a sign—up sheet or a meet-
ing, and that would be asking too much of
our members. We just simply don’t associ-
ate in that manner.”

I asked Serena Evador, a senior majoring
in philosophy, what she believes to be the
biggest issue such a group, if it ever came
into being, faces. She described what she
considers the deadliest of deadlines —— tax
day. According to Evador, “A portion of
each individual’s earnings are thieved by
we1l—intentioned fools, subordinating their
ultimate pursuit of self—interest to the ben-

eﬁt of the greater good. Due to the effects ofg

the great invisible hand, the most efficient
way for individuals to beneﬁt society is to

 ‘contracts with our complicated" law system,
“we willreduce barriers to trade and allow
artisans to craft as they were meant to.” .

Since numerous students like Evador
have independentlypublished such_;_lmend—
ments to ban requirements of all types,
it should be easy to adopt one, but is it a
goodidea‘? » V ‘

The approach these students take to-

 

ward structuring society clearly has its
upsides: There is no such thing as account-
ability and hence no pressure to create
or produce, but the economy still func-
tions. People still generate products, but
they generate them happily. Reaching the
highest levels of production and consumer
satisfaction will require bringing down the
‘collective.’ America thrives on smart, sleek
entrepreneurs.

I have been convinced: such an amend-
ment is the path to elevating the American
quality of life. We should seize this mo-
ment of economic unrest to turn the crony

socialist model on its head and unhinge

American capitalist heroes. We should sup-
port any constitutional amendment to ban
taxes, labor laws and requirements of all

‘types, especially those dreaded deadlines.
, Laws shall only prevent the most terrible of

crimes, and government shall step aside in
favor of the regulation of the great invisible
hand. And then we can truly be one nation,
under the ﬂying spaghetti monster, with
liberty and riches for. all. I

Freshman Boyd receives muliple honors after big day

Tyler Pecyna
Assistamf Sports Editor

After compiling 4195 all-purpose yards in
Saturday’s 49-27 win over New Mexico, Pitt
freshman receiver Tyler Boyd earned weekly
accolades from the football community —
one from the ACC and one from 247Sports.
The ACC named Boyd Receiver ofthe Week
forhis six-catch, 134—yard performance, which
featured one touchdown reception. Boyd aver-

aged more than 22 yards per catch Saturday, .

hauling in two particularly challenging throws
inthe process. 7

The ﬁrst improbable catch came on Pitt’s
second drive of the -day, with just more than
three minutes off the game clock. Redshirt se-
nior quarterback Tom Savage let loose a high-
arching throw to his right side on ﬁrst-and—1o.
Boyd, who had been streaking dovvnﬁeld to
position himselfundemeath the ball, grabbed
the pass outside the hash marks amid single
coverage. Though the New Mexico defender
was ﬂagged for pass interference on the play,
Boyd completed the catch cleanly for a 51-

yard reception and set up the Panthers’ ﬁrst

touchdown of the afternoon. .
Boyd said the penalty upped the catch’s

degree of difficulty. A

“At ﬁrst I thought I was going to fall and

trip up,” he said after the game. “I was real
anxious. I wanted to make that big play, so
that’s what I did.” -

Onthe ﬁnal play of the ﬁrst half, Boyd dis-
played his heroics yet again. Savage scrambled
out of the pocket toward the sideline, time
expiring off the clock, before heaving a line-
drive throw to the end zone. With four play-
ers + two Panthers, two Lobos —— clustered
toward the back comer, Boyd emerged from
the crowd by leapingto snag the pass, allwhile
fallingbackward and  rightfoot into

' the ground to complete a successful 34-yard V

touchdown.

His performance was also littered with
dynamic rushing plays and included a 22-
yard kick return, leading 247Sports, a college
sports website, to dub him the National Tru
Freshmanof the Week. ‘

Boyd ran the ball twice and accumulated
39 yards and atouchdown. The scoring rush
started as an end-around sweep that show-
casedhis dazzling speed and athleticism, as
Boyd dashed through the New Mexico defense

and dove from 5 yards out to break the goal '

4 For the Panthers to compete in the loaded

ACC, Pitt head football coach Paul Chryst must
be able to recruit locally as well as nationally.

If you look at the history of the WPIAL, you
might be shocked by-some of the names you
see: Dorsett, Marino, Revis, Ditka, Namath
and Montana. These are players who have
won Heisman Trophies and National Cham-
pionships in college, as well as Super Bowls
and MVPs in the pros. .

With such a rich base of talent here in
Western Pennsylvania, Paul Chryst and com-
pany can win by effectively recruiting out of
the local hotbed."

Last year’s recruiting classwas certainly an
important one for Pitt football because itwas

the ﬁrstthat Chtystwas able to recruit himself.
Overall, he and his staff did pretty well.

Pitt landed two must—have WPIAL targets
when it signed Clairton’s Tyler Boyd—ranked
No, 165 on the ESPN 300 list —- and Belle

Vernon offensive lineman Dorianjohnson, .

who placed 29th on the same list and was
a ﬁve—star recruit, according to Rivals.com.
There still is a lot of work to be done, though.
In order to build on last year’s moderate
success, the 2014 recruiting class must be
a historic one for the Panthers, not just be-
cause of the names they sign, but because
of the types of athletes they attract. If the
Panthers learned anything from their 41-13
loss to Florida State, hopefully it’s that they
need more athletes like Boyd, who is currently
16th in the country with 173 all—purpose_yards
per game. A be .
The Panthers are off to a decent start, as
the team has signed important players, in-
cluding Betl1el Park offensive lineman Mike

' Grimm and North Allegheny safety Elijah

Zeise. Both players are just three-star recruits
on ESPN, though, so there is still much to be
desired. ‘ ,
The Panthers are still looking at Aliquippa
cornerback Davon Henry, Rivals.com’s 14th-

ranked comerback nationally and the 166th -

overall prospect; Gateway safety Montae
Nicholson, who is the No. 1—ranked safety
in the state and Rivals.com’s 126th prospect
overall; as well as Gateway cornerback An-
thony Davis, the 10th-ranked player in the
state, according to Rivals.com.

The biggest competitors for Pitt in the
Henry sweepstakes are West Virginia and

S Ohio State. For Nicholson, “Michigan State

and Penn State are two of the favorites,” ac-
cording to 247Sports.com, “along with Or-
egon, Pittsburgh and Florida State.”

‘ Andwhile defense will certainly be impor-
tant to the Panthers moving forward, Chryst
is renowned for his offense — especially his

rtunity to add local talent next year

rushing attack — after previously serving as
an offensive coordinator for Wisconsin and
Oregon State. And it is on the offensive side
of the ball where the Panthers might have the
most work to do.

Currently, Pitt is courting three running
backs in the top 40 of Rivals.com’s national
running back recruit list: Western Pennsyl-
vania native Shai McKenzie (20th), Chicago
native Chris James (30th) and Harrisburg
product Robert Martin (39th). The Panthers
have placed an emphasis on ﬁnding running
backs to complement their top young play-
ers such as Boyd and sophomore tight end
J.P. Holtz.

This summer Martin verbally committed‘
to Rutgers, but neither McKenzie norjames
have made a ﬁnal decision as to where they
will commit.

Just this weekjames tweeted “#Pitt or #Wis-

might come down to Chryst’s former employer
and alma mater, Wisconsin, and his current
employer. P V
., McKenzie, the Washington, Pa., native,
is supposedly considering the Panthers and
two ACC rivals, Virginia Tech and Florida
State. McKenzie attended the Panthers game
against Florida State on Labor Day, but he was
on the. Florida State sideline, visiting with the
Seminoles. _ _
_ With the addition of three—star running
back Qadree Ollison, from Buffalo, N.Y., the
Panthers could be in the market for only one
additional back. However, if both James and
McKenzie decideto commit, rumor has it that
Chryst and company won’t turn them away.
