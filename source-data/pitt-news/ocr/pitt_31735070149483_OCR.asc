Winter offers
themed beer

For The Pitt News

The label on bottles of Tr6eg’s
Mad Elf Ale displays a picture of

, a maniacally grinning elf who car-

ries red. cherries slung over his
shoulder. Hoppin’ Frog’s Frosted
Frog Christmas Ale’s bottle de-_
picts a frog in a Santa Claus hat,
greeting the drinker with a raised
glass.

These and other full-bodied,
dark beers populate bars’ and dis—
tributors’ shelves in Oakland and
the city at large as the winter takes
over. Their heavier, nutty feels
and higher alcohol content offer
a change from the lighter summer
ales, enticing customers to drink
on cold nights.

Around wintertime, Church
Brew Works, a Lawrenceville—
based brewpub, turns the taps on
for B-iere de Noel, a malty recipe
of the biére de garde style, which
originated in,France.

house manager at the brewpub
that also operates its own restau-
rant, creates a number of special
beers for the winter. According to

Pitt students prepare forinternship, housing hunt

Byjosh Won
Staff Writer

The spring semester has just begun,
but sophomore Andrew Khoo, a
chemistry major, is already planning
his summer research in Philadelphia
or Pittsburgh. _,

Similarly, Jon Cui, a junior ma-
joring in biochemistry, has started
Working on his housing plans for
the upcoming fall semester.

They are not alone. From hous-
ing and jobs to internships and vol-
unteering, many students will ﬁnd
that preparation for the upcoming
summer and fall starts now.

Housing

Cui will volunteer at.UPMC Pres; -

byterian during the summer, and
wants to make plans to staying in
Pittsburgh until the end ofhis se-
nior year.

a “I have my own lease at Schenley -

House,” Cui said. But his apartment
lease expires in August.’He said that
he plans to renew his lease this
month, ensuring a place for him to

stay for the following fall and spring a

semesters. . -A
This early planning is not un-

usual. A
According to Kevin Stiles, man-

ager of Pitt’s Department of Prop-

’ erty Management, students who

‘want new housing for the summer
' or coming fall semester should start in

their searches immediately.

Stiles said that all of the ‘apart-
ments that the University owns
begin accepting applications for
new tenants onjan. 9. The Univer-

sity owns about 300 apartments' .

in total. .

He recommended that students
begin searching for housing early,
as there are a number of things to
consider, such as number of rooms
desired and what neighborhood
they want to live in.

“You can’t start too early, even :

if it’s just talking to other students
about places,” Stiles said. “Take a

. landlords.

walk, go out and explore the neigh-
borhoods to get afeel for what you’re
looking for.”

Pitt offers services like the Land-
lord ‘Survey put out by the Student
Government Board, which is avail-
able on the Off- Campus Living web-
site, to help students weedthrough

Stiles said that landlords gener-
ally consult with current tenants
about lease renewals in January
and February,. so they know ex-
actly which apartments will be
available.

Another reason tostart early is
to examine leases thoroughly, which
generally last the entire year begin-

ning in August.

“Trust your instincts, and, if
you don’t understand something
[on the lease], ask the landlord,”
Stiles said.

Or students can bring a copy of
the lease to the OCL office at 127
North Belleﬁeld, where Stiles said
that full—time employees with ac-
cess to maps, directories and other
resources are available to answer
questions and assist students look-
ing into ofl'—campus housing.

Ski and snowhoarrl r_:luh
ears up for Seven Springs

mountain runs the students $2. The Friday ,

By Danny Zaidi
Staﬁ‘"Wri ter

Though this winter is off to'an unseasonably '

warm start, members of the Pitt Ski and
Snowboard club will soon hit the slopes.

The Pitt Ski and Snowboard Club will start
busing veteran and inexperienced skiers and
snowboarders to the Seven Springs Moun-
tains Resort, located about an hour outside
of Pittsburgh, for its season of weekly Friday
night trips beginning in early January and
running through February. ‘

Senior Roman Harlovic, the club presi-
dent, said that the club has about 400 mem-
bers so far this year, more than it has ever
-had in the past. To join the Ski and Snow-
board Club, students must pay $5 in dues,
as well as the cost for each trip to Seven
Springs. Through the club, a lift ticket costs
$25, and transportation to and from the

“lt doesn’t matter
what level you are in
terms of your ability to
ski or snowboard.”
— Dan Bintrim

night session normally costs ski and snow-
board enthusiasts $40 a lift ticket.

Students will depart for the ﬁrst time
this year on Jan. 13 at 3 p.m. from Bigelow
Boulevard, across from Soldiers and Sail-
ors, and will get back to campus at 11 p.m.
that night.

Dan Bintrim, senior and vice president
of the Ski and Snowboard Club, said that
normally, about 130 to 150 members at-
tend each trip. The club sends buses to the
mountain about six or seven times over two

months, but students can also drive up on V

their own. 2

“It’s a good time,” said Bintrim, who has
been involved in the club since his fresh-
man year. “It is a pretty laid—back club. You
can participate as much or as little as you
want.”

According to Harlovic, the members
range from novices to experts, and new
members can be admitted at any time.

“The club has a lot of ﬁrst—timers from
year—to—year, and a lot of veterans as well,”
he said. '

For those just starting out, Harlovic said
some students choose to rent equipment
on the mountain, but that about 75 percent
of members board the buses with personal
equipment in tow. The renting costs are $16
for-skis ‘and $25 for a snowboard rental.

Once they reach their destination, the
skiers and snowboarders can take their pick
from 32 slopes and trails and six terrain
parks offered at Seven Springs.

‘.‘It doesn’t matter what level you are in

T Bintrim said. “You can

‘take a look at the club’s Facebook page, “Pitt

 
 
   
     

terms of your ability
to" ski-or snowboard,”-

be an expert, and there
still is a challenge.”
Senior Joe Filippini
said he began snowboard-
ing at a young age, but the
Ski and Snowboard Club pro-
vided him with the opportu-
nity to try his hand at skiing.
“I was pretty experienced.
I was snowboarding since
Iwas 12, but I hadn’t -
skied, and I was
able to do
that through
the club,” he
said, adding ,
that he still remains loyal to the snowboard
since he has been doing it so long.
Filippini echoed Bintrim’s description of
the club’s easygoing atmosphere.
“The club has been very accessible and
easy to get into and maintain connections

In terms of the price of dues, Harlovic
said the normal Seven Springs prices don’t
apply for the members of the club. Seven
Springs gives the club the lowest group fare.
The club also receives partial funding from
the Student Government Board.

Harlovic advised. interested students to

can ﬁnd more information on costs, regis-
tration and updates. I

him, it is “very rare” that a seasonal beer,

winter or otherwise, does not sell Well.
The dates the brewery begins offering its

seasonal beers vary with the demand and

_ how quickly other beers run out. “It’s nota

speciﬁc date, but as the weather turns, we
start to go darker,” Moran said. _

Moran, who has worked for the brewery
and restaurant for more than seven years,
said a black ale that might be suitable for the
season is the Renegade Ale, so named when
Steelers fans began using the Styx song as
an anthem. .

The brewery’s Llama Lager, which, like
the rest of the restaurant’s selection, is
brewed on the altar of the Catholic church
that previously occupied the building, in-
cludes quinoa.

Quinoa is a pseudocéreal which originat-
ed in the South American Andes mountains
and is becomingly increasihgly popular in

the U.S. as an alternative to grains such as‘

rice and wheat. It gives the Llama Lager a
nutty ﬂavor. ' — -

But for imbibers whose taste buds that
prefer wheat, The Porch, an Oakland restau-
rant which opened in November and over-
looks Schenley Plaza, offers Blue Moon’s
Winter Abbey Ale, a malty, Trappist—style
ale which carrieslhints of wheat.

Joshua Palashoif, manager of The Porch,
said the Winter Abbey Ale is the restaurant’s
only seasonal beer, but it has proven popular.
He said the restaurant emptied two kegs
within the ﬁrst three weeks of business. _

V Winter Abbey Ale is one of the seasonal
products of the Colorado—based brewing
company Blue Moon, which rotates four
separate seasonal beers throughout the year
— one for each season.‘ '

Also close to campus, Peter’s Pub on
Oakland Avenue offers several selections
for winter revellers. Mad Elf, an IPA from
Triiegs Brewing Company, is a particular
favorite. A

“It’s Triiegs. It’s local, and it’s got pretty

high alcohol content,” said Andy Stacki‘e— '

According to Stackiewicz, who has
worked at Peter’s Pub for seven years, Triiegs
only distributes a limited supply of Mad Elf
in the area. He pointed out that the bar also
stocks. Samuel Adams Winter White Ale, the
nationally recognized brewery’s pale ale, and

- Great Lakes Christmas Ale, a dark ale.

John Elavsky has owned Hemingway’s
Cafe for 16 years. The seasonal beers he of-
fers all have one thing in common. “They’re
all my style because they’re darker,” Elavsky
said. “For winter, that’s typical.”

Hemingway’s also offers Samuel Adams -

Winter Lager, Pittsburgh’s Penn ‘Brewery’s
St. Nik Dark Bock, Le'inenkugel’s Fireside

- Nut Brown Ale, Blue Moon Winter Abbey

Ale and Festivus, a brown ale from Pennsyl-
vania’s Full Pint Brewing Company in North
Versailles.

But for beer enthusiasts who want even
more variety, Sharp Edge brewpub in Friend-
ship adds about 70 to 75 winter options to its
menu each year. Brett McMahan has worked
for the company for a little more than 10
years. Sharp Edge is a brew company that
owns ﬁve stores and bistros at locations in
and around Pittsburgh.

According_to McMahan, Sharp Edge’s
cellarman, breweries and distributors offer a
large variety of new seasonals each year.

While the styles of winter beer vary wide— ‘

ly from Belgian types to hoppy India Pale
Ales and heavy stouts, they tend to share
certain features. A

“They usually have a little more body to
them, ‘as well as more alcohol in there with
the [extra] body,” McMahan said.

He said that the beers often include notes
of coffee or chocolate, or distinct hints of
spices. The images and names on their labels
make them popular with shoppers looking
for gifts, as well as those lured by the higher
alcohol content. ’

But for McMahan, one of the great things
about selling beer is the variety. “It’s about
ﬁnding out what the customer really wants,”
McMahan said. ‘

Like McMahan, Moran emphasized the
range of the selection as much as any indi-
vidual ﬂavor. “Beers go quickly here, and
they change very quickly,” Moran said. I

or here at Pitt over the summer months.‘

After asking his adviser and networking
with family members, he was able to ﬁnd a
group of professors looking for undergradu-
ate researchers. -

“[It’s a position on] molecular diagnos-
tics, which happens to coincide with the de-
partment I am volunteering in at UPMC,” he
said. ’

Looking to gain experience to help him

when he graduates, Khoo is already work- "

ing on his application for a research position
with University of Pennsylvania for this sum-
mer. As the February application deadline
looms, Khoo hopes to ﬁnish his application
this month. _ ’

Khoo is one of many students searching for
internships, research positions and jobs on the
eternal quest to bolster his resume.

Associate Director for Career Develop-
ment and Placement Assistance Karin Asher
said that students should consistently revise
their resumes. '

“The resume is a work in progress and
should always be updated. As students gain
more academic and extracurricular experi-
ences at Pitt, they should replace less signiﬁ-
cant high school experiences,” Asher said.

In order to gain more experience through
internships over the summer, students have
a number of University resources available.

_Asher stressed the importance of making an

Spring break Cultural Immersion March 2-10

account in FutureLinks on careers.pitt.edu in
order to access internship listings.

Other resources for gaining experience
include non-University-afﬁliate internships.
com and the Pitt Career Network, made up of
Pitt alumni. The PCN is an online directory of
volunteering alumni who provide information
about their careers and offer professional
advice to students seeking employment in
similar ﬁelds. ‘

“Many  
internship
deadlines end
as early as
February. . 
— Karin Asher

As online resources such as FutureLinks
and intemships.com are application-based
and varying in availability, students should
begin searching for preferred internships in
January, constantly checking updated listings
throughout the year. t — .

Following this preparative event will be
one that provides job opportunities for Pitt
students: the Spring Career Fair on Feb. 7 and
Feb. 8 in the William PittlUnion.

Here, stalls of potential employers will
introduce students to their businesses and
potentially accept resumes for internships
and jobs.’  l -

Finally, on April 4, the Summer Survival
Job Fair will take place _in the WPU, with 75
organizations discussing summer job oppor-
tunities in Pittsburgh.

While there are opportunities like these
available, many summer employers ﬁnish the
selection process much earlier.

“Many internship deadlines end as early as
February for summer positions,” Asher said,
but she acknowledged that some positions
can be available for applications until the end
of the semester.

Assistant Director of Career Development
and Placement Assistance Ryan Sweeny said
that students should complete their Career
Action Plan on FutureLinks as soon as pos-
sible.

This action plan outlines a checklist of
things students should have completed ac-
cording to their year, from freshman to se-
nior. ‘

One of the ﬁrst things suggested inthe plan
is to consult with a career counselor about
making a resume, so that it can be uploaded
to FutureLinks, where potential employers
can view it.

Asher invites any student seeking assis-
tance with resume building or with any other
aspect of professional development to visit

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

The point of New Year’s resolutions

If Benjamin Franklin couldn’t perfect himself, then neither can you

NEW_ 

RESO-
LUTIO

Mike Rosenthal I Staff Illustrator

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

The new year is a time for reﬂec-
tion and rebirth: We reﬂect on
how much we ate over the holi-
days, and our guilt for doing so
is reborn. .

The new year also inspires all
kinds of resolutions: to exercise
more, exercise more discretion,
lose weight, stopismoking and
so forth. This pursuit of self-
improvement and perfection is
admirable, but perhaps, as our
imperfect founding father Ben
Franklin suggested, futile. In his
autobiography, Franklin likened
the process of perfecting oneself
to polishing an axe, grinding
slowly and laboriously to remove
each last speck of rust. In a classic
illustration of the law of diminish-
ing, marginal return, however, it
gets progressively more difficult
to remove every last bit. After at-

tempting this process of moral

‘self-perfection, Franklin, like

many of us after a few months of

‘- trying to keep our resolutions,

decided he liked a speckled axe
best. >

Let’s face it: New Year’s reso-
lutions are often dead by April.
Some of us even forget what it
was that we pledged to do as we
watch the Rose Bowl while eat-
ing our way through the third bag
.of Doritos. Thus, we have to ask
ourselves: What’s the real point of
making these resolutions? Once
we’ve discovered the answer, we
can formulate ‘resolutions in the
most appropriate manner.

First off, "it should be pretty
clear that, for the majority of us,
New Year’s resolutions are not
really about self-improvement.
That’s not to say some people
don’t take them seriously and ac-
complish them. That’s also not to
demean self-improvement. How-
ever, many people merely attempt

  
   

/we
::.'.’.‘\‘

to create the illusion of self-im-
provement by setting goals at a
socially acceptable time of year. If
most New Year’s resolutions were
really serious, we would either pay
more attention to them or not wait

‘ until the new year rolled around to

achieve them. Serious resolutions
would occur on April 28 or Febru-
ary 5 or October 25 —— dates with
no -signiﬁcance other than their
status as the day we made up our
minds about something.

The reason many of us make
New Year’s resolutions is that
they make us feel resolute and
like we are accomplishing some:
thing without having to do any
work. And if we care to share our
resolutions, they might make us
more appealing to the opposite
gender. Nobody could resist a gid—'
dy reaction such as “Oh, wow! I’d
never be able to climb Aconcagua!
You are so brave and strong and
manly!” when in reality, we don’t

know a mountain from a mole-
hill; Because everybody makes
New Year’s resolutions and most
people renege on them, we don’t
have to feel so bad about not keep-
ing them. Everybody loves telling
little white lies now and then, and
it’s much more acceptable to say
“I’m going to start running” and
not do it than to say “boss, I’ll
have that report-by Tuesday” and
not follow through. .

So with those ends and means

in mind, how should resolutions
be made? The key is to pick good
deeds that would be nice to ac-
complish, are challenging and
have as long or as indistinct a
deadline as possible. The objec-
tives should be vague and difﬁcult
to measure, such as a resolution to
be more studious and organized.
The resolutions should have wide
appeal, and,- considering you
wish to ‘appear as a selﬂess and
sensitive individual, they should
not pander to crass, prurient or
Washington special interests.
Makinga list is a good thing, ‘as
all important things have paper-

work associated with them. If you

want to feel especially important, A

go ahead and use some nice sta-

. tionery and a fountain pen. Of ’

course, in a few short months
you will lose the list because of
poor organization, which means
you can create the appearance of
a paper trail without actually leav-
ing one. Evenbetter, if you do ﬁnd

the list around September, you’
can always re-use some of the key

resolutions for the next new year,
saving you the trouble of having
to think too much. You can also
avoid accusations of being a “flip—
ﬂopper” and gain respect for your

consistency (Ron Paul’s resolution
has been to abolish the Fed for 30
years running).

Once you have drawn up a list
of resolutions, you should share
them. Often. In fact, if you irritate

the same people with the same_

babble about the great stuff you
have planned for the new year, at
some point they will stop paying
attention. A great paradox of in-
terpersonal relationships is that
the importance of something in
someone’s mind often decreases
with the frequency of repetition.

‘ . Granted, this is a great way to lose

friends and alienate people, but

also a great way to build up a repu-
tation as a “character,” especially
if you mix in some anachronistic
and weird resolutions, such as re-
solving to wear your.“I Like Ike”
button every Thursday.

Yes, the new year offers new
opportunities and possibilities,

like the opportunity to ham it up ‘

with the best resolution list ever,
now that you know, why you are

Few words could be written
about our city without remark-
ing on the unique love affair be-
tween its inhabitants and the

game. Somewhere amid the de-—

caying industrial smoke stacks and
dwindling population is a pride
that maybe shouldn’t be there. In
the wake of former head football
coach Todd Graham’s departure
from Pitt, I wonder if he even no-
ticed.

By all accounts, Pittsburgh
should be a ghost town, replete
with lifeless souls that missed the
last train out of a desolate place.
After all, this is a city built on steel.
Its heroes — Andrew Carnegie,
Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mel-
lon — persist only on street signs
and building facades, relegated
otherwise to the history books.

A city with a population that

has fallen to just under half its

previous high and a namesake

industry that moved on decades
ago‘ is not supposed to be proud.

I didn’t grow up _a Pitt fan, and

I didn’t know this was a football
school. I’d heard the names Dan
Marino, Tony Dorsett and Larry
Fitzgerald, but I didn’t know they
were connected to Pitt — that
they had once walked. the same

halls as me and lived on the same '

grounds.
I didn’t know that we once had

_ one of the ﬁercest rivalries in the

country with Penn State. I didn’t
know there was once a Pitt Sta-
dium that stood within walking
distance of the Cathedral. In fact, I
didn’t even know that Pitt had ever
won a national championship. I
learned to love the history of our
football team and the traditions of
our school. I discoveredthe pride
of this city. l

Enter former head football
coach Todd Graham. Exciting?
Yes. We were ready for a new
brand of football. Just as the grit
and muscle of the steel industry
is now overshadowed, so too did
we hope that Pitt would rise to top
of college football with a new ap-
proach to the game.

He spoke like a Visionary with

his “my-way—or—the-highway” at-
titude, but it concealed something
else. '

Some may claim they always
found him suspicious, but the truth

is we’ll maybe never know what re- '

ally compelled him to abandon our
school after only one season. Like
the star—crossed lovers that foot-
ball and Pittsburgh are, emotions
don’t always make sense.

Maybe he never understood
what football truly means to this
city. Or maybe he understood

that Pitt’s blue and gold are more
than just colors on a uniform,
that they’re a symbol of pride that
shouldn’t logically be there, and
that’s why he left. Regardless, I
bid him good riddance.

The Appalachian hills have
borne silent witness to Pittsburgh
for hundreds of years. They’ve felt
the agony of war in Pontiac’s Re-
bellion. They’ve seen the billowing
dark clouds of steel. They’ve heard
the cheers rise from football sta-
diums. They’ve experienced the
love story that rivals those taught
in our academic buildings. I just
hope new head coach Paul Chryst
can understand. I

Panthers fall in Compass Bowl

Pitt footballfinished its tumultuous season with a 2S-6 loss to SMU

By Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

One of the most-hyped seasons in
Pitt football history came to an
end Saturday when the Panthers

fell 28-6 to Southern Methodist

University in the BBVA'Compass
Bowl, played in.Birmingham,
Ala., at»Legion Field. _. —

With SMU already up 21-3 in

~ the second quarter, a crucial mo-

ment came when Pitt looked to an
onside kick to rally the team. A

’ fair catch was signaledby one of

the Mustangs, but the ball wasn’t
ﬁelded cleanly. The Panthers
jumped on the ball, but an inad-
vertent whistle stopped the Pitt
turnover and forced a re-kick.

“Both of the officials came ,

over to me. and said we made a
bad call; with ’ the inadvertent
whistle,” Interim coach Keith
Patterson said. “They were very
apologetic. Nothing you can do
about that. That was a big mo-
mentum changer. Looking back
it was difficult.”

The play ﬁred up the defense
that stopped SMU all but once
following‘ that whistle.

“Even though it was blown
dead, it was still a big momen-

tum shift for us,” senior defen- ,

sive tackle Myles Caragein said.
“Our defense got really ﬁred up
after that, especially with all of
the pushing and shoving. It was
still a big play for us and got our
defense going.”

The bounces would continue

to go S'MU’s way. On their next P

threatening drive, junior quar-
terback Tino Sunseri drove the
Panthers down the ﬁeld 74 yards

' to the Mustangs’ 10-yard line.

Sunseri found freshman running
back Isaac Bennett for his check-
down, but after a few deﬂections,
the ball landed in the hands of
SMU linebacker Stephon Sand-
ers. .
Sunseri finished his roller
coaster junior campaign by go-
ing 19 for 28 with 128 yards and
just the one interception in his
second career bowl game.

But it’s a series of uncommon

mistakes that will deﬁne the Pan-

thers’ last game of the season.
Another play that won’t show

up in the statistics line was’ an at-.

tempted fake punt that saw fresh-
man defensive tackle Khaynin
Mosley—Smith get around the
edge to pick up the ﬁrst down,
only to be whistled backfon an
illegal-motion penalty.

The Panthers were forced to

I punt following the mishap, and

SMU capitalized for its only
second-half touchdown on the
next drive. . -

“That was going to be a big
play,” Patterson said. “We were
trying to keep our offense out
on the ﬁeld.”

“The officials
  came over to
me and said
we made a—.
bad Call.”
’ -Keith Patterson

Later, Pitt would add another
Kevin Harper ﬁeld goal to bring

its total to six points for the day .

and end one of the lowest-scoring
offensive seasons in recent mem-
ory for the Blue and Gold. ‘ -

Despite Graham’s constant
talk of high-octane offense, the
Panthers averaged only 24.2
points per game. That number
ranks second lowest in the past
ten years behindponly the 2007-
2008 squad, which only managed
22.8 points per game.

Pitt was left with ﬁve coaches
for the bowl game, and Patterson,
the Panthers’ defensive coordina-
tor, was tagged with the interim
head coach title.

Having ﬁve coaches limited
the players’ preparation, and the
fact that all members of their pro-
gram were worrying about their
jobs only added to the team’s

distractions. According to Pat-
terson, many coaches and players
were not completely focusedon
winning their second-straight
BBVA Compass Bowl.

“You have a lot of people with
a lot of irons in the ﬁre,” Patter-
son said. “Coaches wondering
where they are going to live,
players look-ing at their future,
and positions that didn’t even

have their position coach. We

don_’t want to use that as an ex-

. cuse, but there is a lot going on

mentally.”

Patterson will move on to
Arkansas State to take over the
reins as its defensive coordina-
tor under former Auburn and

' Tulsa offensive coordinator Gus
I Malzahn.

The players have said the ex-
traordinary circumstances have
brought them together over the
past month, and the coaches
that stayed to ﬁnish the job with
the Panthers’ have gained a lot
of respect from the players and
fans. '

“It no doubt has been the most

challenging four weeks of my life‘

and career,” Patterson said. “I
wouldn’t change anything. I have
great respect for these young
men for ﬁnishingvand staying
together. That was worth it.”
The senior class for Pitt will
go out with its first losing season,
as the loss to SMU knocked the
Panthers to 6-7. As a class, the
seniors ﬁnished 33-19 in their
four years at Pitt, with one losing

‘ season, and made a bowl game

every year.

“I consider them my broth-
ers,” Caragein said. “That’s going
to be the biggest thing to let go.
It’s so hard to realize it’s ﬁnally
over. I would do anything to keep
playing with those guys. I love
them so much and would do any-
thing to stay with them.”

Recently hired head coach
Paul Chryst kept his distance
from the team. Chryst said he
was trying to respect the Pan-
thers and the season that he had
nothing to do with.

“This is the culmination of
their season,” Chryst said. “This
wasn’t me.” 1

Byjasper Wilson _
Staﬁ" Writer

Iasia Hemingway scored a career-
high 33 points for Syracuse when
the Orange handily defeated Pitt
83-60 on Saturday afternoon at
the Petersen Events Center.

Pitt had. no_answer for the
senior, who scored 18 of her 33
points in the second half after
the Panthers stayed within seven
points of the Orange in the ﬁrst
half.

Pitt had a 16-5 run midway
through the ﬁrst half that illus-
trated the potential present in
the young squad.

In the middle of the run, Abby
Dowd was fouled in the act of
shooting from her immovable

' place beyond the arc. After Dowd‘

converted all three of her free
throws, Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato switched to a full-court
press that paid immediate divi-
dends as Ashlee Anderson in-
tercepted an errant pass at the
Orange free—throw line and con-
verted for a three—point play.-
Pitt’s ihspired play roused the
dormant crowd and, for one of
the few times this season, there

was some semblance of an excited
atmosphere inside the Petersen
Events Center. However, the 26-
25 lead —— Pitt’s only lead of the
game — would last less than a
minute, from 5:51 to 4:54.

During that span, "the Pan-
thers added only one point to
make it a two-point lead (27-25)
before allowing Syracuse to draw
even with two Phylesha Bullard
free throws.

Redshirt sophomore Ashlee I
Anderson, who led the Panthers

with 14 points, said communica-
tion was to blame for Pitt surren-_
dering the lead so quickly.

“We didn’t do a good job talk-

ing, and that’s kind of where a P

lot of our mistakes came because
they had two back-to-back threes
[by Carmen Tyson—Thomas],”
Anderson said. ”We just have to
do a better job of talking. And
just knowing where the players
are on the court and who has the

.hot hand in that situation.?’

Syracuse head coach Quen-
tin Hillsman said that when he
looked at game tape from two

years ago, he saw that an effective _.
way to attack Pitt was through

the high post.

FOOTBALL

  
   

By Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

I’ High octane. The phrase was used

to increase the anticipation of an
uptempo, powerful, new style of
offensive strategies built by head
coach Todd Graham. But today,
the phrase is used sarcastically

7 to describe the Pitt football sea-

son’s disappointments and me-
diocrity.
The ‘season ﬁnally came to a

close Saturday afternoon after ,

Pitt’s 28-6 loss to Southern Meth-
odist University in the BBVA Com-

pass Bowl. The game highlighted '

one of the Panthers’ biggest prob-
lems over the course of the sea-
son: a weak offensive line. Pitt let
up seven sacks against SMU last
weekend, which makes 63 sacks

' for the entire season.

Quarterback Tino Sunseri
— who was sacked more times
than any other quarterback in

the NCAA -— looked uncomfort-
able throughout the entire sea-
son. With 11 picks to 10 touch‘-
downs, Sunseri’s season provided
much ‘controversy and dispute,
His overall performance did not
satisfy Pittsburgh fans, and the
coaching staff began to mishandle
his playing time.

Coach Graham had Sunseri in

‘ a,whirlwind. First, he would say

that he had total conﬁdence in his
quarterback who possessed “the
best chance of winning.” But then,
inexplicably, during the game,

’ Sunseri would be pulled for true

freshman Trey Anderson to at-
tempt to get the offense moving.
When Sunseri had a strong outing
— 419 yards, two touchdowns
—— against Connecticut on Oct.
26th, Graham described the per-
formance as “average”. Without a
doubt, Sunseri felt the pressure
on the ﬁeld from thedéfense and
on the sidelines from his coach.
The outcome was erratic play and

mixed results over the course of
13 games.

Sunseri wasn’t the only one
guilty: of inconsistency. As a
team, the Panthers’ fourth quar-
ter performances ﬂuctuated like
the stock market. Of Pitt’s seven
losses, four were determined in

the ﬁnal ﬁfteen minutes of play.

Losses to teams like Notre
Dame and‘West Virginia, despite
Pitt leads late in the game, really
changed the outcome of the sea-
son. Pitt could have had control
of the Big East, but instead lost to
Cincinnati in the ﬁnal minutes on
a ﬁeld goal. Then there was the
embarrassing 17-point collapse

against Iowa in the third game '

of the season.

Pitt was always close but was
also always unable to ﬁnish the
tight games. With the exception
of an upset victory over then—No.
16 South Florida and a strong out-
ing against UConn, the offensive
attack never shined under what

Graham promised to be “high-
octane” play.

Of course, Graham decided
to bolt to Arizona’ State after not
even completing his ﬁrst year for
the Panthers, leaving his players
with nothing but a broken—down
offense and a text message. The

' team did not take the news well

at all, expressing their frustration
on Twitteriwith angry remarks
about their former coach.

After that, the Panthers had
difﬁcultyimoving forward to close
the season. Interim coach Keith
Patterson — Pitt’s ﬁfth coach in
only 13 months ~— noticed that
the distractions hit-the players
hard. ' '

“The one thing I kept challeng-
ing everybody on the team to do
is to ﬁnish,” Patterson said after
Saturday’s loss to SMU. “They
represented as well as they pos-
sibly could.”

But now that this season of
mediocrity is over, Pitt has to look

forward to. what lies ahead.
With Wisconsin’s Paul Chryst

coming in to take over head

coaching duties, Pitt is hoping

that Chryst can be the long-term ‘

solution to a position that has
seen disappointment and uncer-
tainty in the past year. Chryst is
excited to move away from all the

P distractions and bring new quali-

ties to the team.

Chryst expressed that he had
“a lot of appreciation for how
they’re finishing things out”
from what was a crazy season.
He already has some ideas to
bring the players to the success
they want. _

“[Pitt will be] a balanced of-
fense,” Chryst said during half-
time in Saturday’s bowl game.
Balance was unattainable in the
contest against SMU, as Pitt only
acquired 7 rushing yards.‘

sonnel surrounding the running back posi-

tions. Pitt — known for producing strong
running backs in the last ﬁve years —— may
have a three—headed monster going into
next season.

First, Ray Graham, who suffered a sea-
son-ending knee injury against UConn,
should ‘be back next year to light up Hei-
nz Field in his senior season. With 2,229
rushing yards and 21 scores in his career,
Graham will undoubtedly be a huge help

backs — showed signs that he can carry

Then there is Rushel Shell —— one of the
top running back recruits in the nation —
Pittsburgh local who attended Hopewell
High School.'Shell holds the Pennsylvania
high school record of 39 consecutive 100-
yard games.

WllMEN’S BASKETBALL

FROMPAGE7  f’

way’s main point of attack despite Pitt con-

- stantly crowding the paint, which made it
C V difficult for Hemingway to get the ball.

Over time, her teammates’ performance
opened the ﬂoor up. ’
“At the free—throw line, it was like one

u [Pitt player] behind me, one in front of
me, so it was tough to get me the ball,” '-

Hemingway said. “But Carmen and La’Shayv
[Taft] made some threes so they had to go
out a little bit, which made it better for me
to get the ball in the-high post.”

Hillsman said his team did a good job
of limiting its turnovers and capitalizing

' .0n Pitt’S.

“We just wanted to take care of the ball
ourselves,”_Hillsman said. “Normally, we’re
on the back end of turning the ball over.
We’ve been making a real conscious effort’

A ' of just protecting the ball. I thought that

was huge for us so when we can flip that
number and win the points off turnovers
it’s very big for us.”

Syracuse converted 23 points off 23 Pitt
turnovers. .

If the ﬁrst half showed the team’s poten-
tial, the second half highlighted the tea_m’s
inexperience. Berenato lamented her
team’s performance in the second half.

“They caused a lot of problems with
our offense in the second half,” she said.
“I thought in the ﬁrst half we stayed with
them and really kept to our game plan-.
And in the second half we just went hay‘-
wire, you know, we didn’t score. We need
to gefproduction. We have to be able to
get baskets.” '

' In the second half, Pitt struggled to
solve the hyperactive Syracuse half-court
defense, settling for outside or contested

. _looks.

As a result, the team’s field goal per-
centage fell from 41.4 percent in the ﬁrst
half to 29.2 percent in the second half.

‘“[The Orange] were really active, and
they moved on defense,” Berenato said. “I

thought their guards moved. Their guards -

pinched  I felt we were hesitant  They
didn’t give you a lot of looks.”

Anderson agreed,‘ saying that the team
needs to be more decisive when it has pos-
session." , p  

The Panthers’ defense also drew Ber-
enato’s ire. “You can’t give a team 38 free
throws,” she said. “A goal was not to give
them free throws. We fouled them at will.
Every time down the" court, we fouled
them.” _ -

Sophomore Marquel Davis, who fin-
ished with 11, said Hemingway exploited
a matchup problem for Pitt. “She has a
quicker step than most posts because she’s
a small post, so  she’s kind of guardlike,”
Davis said. “A lot of times we let her get the
ball, and then it was a one—on—one situa-
tion. That’s like her game; she wants to go
one—on—one withthe post.”

The Panthers‘ are back in action tomor-

row night against Rutgers at the Petersen_—
