JIM MARINO

Varsity Marching Band will be sitting in the student
section again this year and will cooperate with’ cheerleaders
and Block “P” during cheers and flashcard demonstrations.

The band attended the Pitt-West Virginia game on Sat-
urday after returning that morning from their encampment
at Kon—O-Kwee. The Saturday game ended a week of vigor-

ous
the

lug

week at Kon—O-Kwee drill-
and rehearsing formation on
a 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. schedule, tak-
ing time out only for meals. Ac-
cording to reports, the weather at
the Zelienople camp was cold and
damp with temperatures at night
around the 25 degree mark.

Old and New Train

For the first time freshmen and
old band members started the
training week at the same time.
Freshmen were previously given
the opportunity of a “warm-up”
period of two days before the act-
ual drilling started.

The first public performance by
the band was given on Friday at
Farrel High School, Farrel, Pa.
«.,Ear1y the next morning the band

left for the West Virginia game.

Norfolk, Va. will be the scene
of the band’s next appearance

away from home as the 120-

piece marching group attends

' the Oyster Bowl game, between

Pitt and Duke University.

Some of the formations re-
hearsed at the camp were two
entirely new shows. One of the
displays is based on the Broadway
‘musical “The King And I.” This
show features a Siamese twin for-
mation which will move about the
ﬁeld. It also includes a formation

To Speak

Joseph S. Clark, Democratic
candidate for the U. S. Senate,
will speak to Pitt students

in an effort to determine the
student viewpoint on issues

or national importance. The pro-
gram is being sponsored by the
Young Democratic Club and Pitts-
burgh‘s Students for Stevenson.
Mr. Clark says he wants, in
particular, to ﬁnd out student
opinion on the present seniority
rule in the Senate, which awards
committee chairmanships on the
basis of time served iii the Sen-
ate and not on the basis of pop-
ular choice of the membership.
Mr. C l a r k himself favors
changes in this rule.

Following his speech, Mr. Clark
will receive questions from the
audience. Then he will ask ques-
tions to the students and a dis-
cussion period will follow.

Plans Expansion of

Discount Program

By MILLARD AMDUR

An expanded program of
Student Discount has been
arranged by Stanley Franzos,
Bus. Ad. ’59, chairman of the
project, and his committee.
Nineteen merchants in the

Downtown, Oakland, and Squirrel
Hill areas have consented to offer
a 10% discouht to students of the
district colleges.

The discount program is de-
signed to save the college stu-
dent money. Student discount
cards for 1956-57 were distrib-
uted at registration and are
available at the Student Desk
free of charge fo anyone who
has not yet obtained one.

Last year, few students took ad-
vantage of the discount. Franzos
states that more ﬁrms are likely
to enter Student Discount if ac-
tive participation and interest is
shown by thestudent body.
Participating merchants in the
Student Discount program are:

New Secret Society Organized
At Confidential Dinner Meeting

By FITZHUGH SCHENLEY

(Editor’s Note: Fitzhugh Schenley, last year’s junior reporter for
the ill-fated Omnibus, has joined the staﬁ‘ of the PITT NEWS.
En route from the Casbah to the Hollywood Social Club, he dropped
into the PITT NEWS ofice with the newsbeat on Pitt’s newest extra-

curricular activity as "yet unrecognized by COROSO.)
_ Members of Pitt’s newly—formed GA Society of faculty,
administration and students met in the second—ﬂoor hide-

away of an unspeciﬁed restaurant on an unnamed evening

last week to complete formally the
plans for their new organization.
In line with the secretive policy
(the “A” stands for Anonymous)
neither the place, the names of
the members, nor the date was
announced. Since their activity is
not secret (the “G” stands for
Gourmets) details of the dinner
which preceded the organizational
meeting have been announced.

Gourmets Anonymous will ask
once each month a worthy chef
to show his skill in providing a
dinner for the group.

At their ﬁrst meeting the new
Pitt group built their menu around

 

the specialite du jour, chicken lob-
sters.’ The ﬁrst course consisted
of cherrystone clams, attractively
arranged on a bed of ice. The chef
recommended a dash of lemon
juice as the only sauce, but the
members found that a highly-sea-
soned chili sauce containing fresh
horseradish added zest to this ap-
petizer.

Chicken lobsters, two for each
guest, were served as the main
course. They were brought to the
table hot from the broiler and
served with drawn butter. The
lobster was accompanied by a

Awardee Favors
System of Learning
England Practices

By GORDON C. CLOWNEY
(Editor’s Note: This is the third
in a series on student trips to
Europe.)

Last year’s “S” awardee,
Bob McCabe, was very favor-
ably impressed. with the sys-
tem of learning he participated in

while studying at Oxford this
summer.

Bob spent eight weeks at Ox-
ford, Where the method of learn-
ing is builtaround a series of lec-
tures and tutorials. The lectures
are usually general; and the stu-
dents attend only those that deal
with the subjects they are study-
ing. All discussion and work done
by the students are reserved for
the tutorials, which meet once a
week.

Dress Formal

Tutorials, Bob points out, are
comprised of only two or three
students and instructor. Students
come to the tutorial dressed in
black robes resembling some-
what our graduation robes. A 2500
Word paper is usually required of
each of the students, to be pre-
sented at, and discussed in the
tutorial each week. _

When asked if the system of‘
study at Oxford was harder
than that of American universi-

with his duties on the Student
Council. “

Previous to coming to Pitt, Dr.
Thomas worked in the public
school systems in Minnesota and
the ' state of Washington. Dr.
Thomas did his undergraduate
work at the University of Wash-
ington and received his master of
arts and doctor of education de-
gree from Columbia University.

FIREPLACE in the English Room was originally in the House
of Commons of the British Parliament.

  
   

“S” Awardee Bob Mc-

Cabe visited the parliament during his stay in England this past
summer. Bob spent eight weeks studying at Oxford, where the
teaching method is based on lectures and tutorials.

ties, such as Pitt, Bob said that
he thought it was mostly a mat-
ter of individual initiative. How-
ever, he said that he felt a stu-
dent really interested in learn-
ing could gain far more at Ox-
ford than at Pitt. .
Bob added that probably more
than a ‘few Pitt students would be
interested in having the British
system installed in the University,
when he noted that no student, no
matter how “slow,” was “flunked
out” of the British school. Degrees
are awarded such as ﬁrst, second,
third and fourth, with the top one
going to the highest segment of
the graduating class. Students of
lesser ability receive lower de-
grees, which include those stu-
dents at the bottom of the class.

Saw Parliament
While studying in London, Bob
had an opportunity to observe
meetings of Parliament. He wit-
nessed the proceedings from the

“Stranger’s Gallery,” where in-
terested observers are asked to
sign a paper stating that they will

refrain from engaging in the de-'

bates going on down on the floor.

London bobbies, "who carry no
guns, impressed Bob very much
with their polite, helpful manner.
He said that, unlike the majority
of the American police force, they
think nothing of going out of their
way to lend a helping hand, no
matter what the situation.

Students Scolded
Another interesting and also
somewhat surprising thing about
the London bobbies is that when
they apprehend a student, no mat-
ter what the offense, the student
is not arrested; but he is turned
over to the “Protor” of his col-
lege, who decides upon the pun-
ishment necessary.
Commenting on. newspapers’,
Bob stated that several of the
London papers are very con-

Fifty Local Execs
Take Sales Class

Fifty local sales executives have
become students again to_ attend
a new course offered for the ﬁrst
time at the University.

The course is “Sales Admini-
stration,” planned and promoted
under the joint sponsorship of the

Sales Executive Club of Pitts-‘

burgh and the Pitt School of
Business Administration.

The class will meet weekly
beginning Wednesday, Sept. 26,
from 8:05 to 9:50 p.m. in 1441
C]. Robert J. Qhapel, lecturer in
economics and marketing, is co-
ordinator for the course.

Each of the 15 class sessions
will present a different topic for
discussion. Guest lecturers, all ex-
perts in their ﬁelds, will lead the
discussions.

Topics to be considered include
sales department organization, re-
cruiting, selection, training, sup-
ervision and compensation of
salesman, selling tools, sales terri-
tories, and sales control.

servative. The London Times
has nothing on the front page
but classified ads, the news be-
ing contained on the inside
pages. Even such startling news
as the sinking of the “Andria
Doria” received no more than a
two column headline.

Gas stations are not as num-
erous as in the United States; and
“when you drive into one,” re-
minds Bob, “you’d better ask for
petrol instead of gas, or you may
find out, as one motorist did, that
the word gas may be mistaken for
air, and you may ﬁnd your tires
being ﬁlled, instead of your gas
tank.”

Bob was favorably impressed
not only with the city of London,
but with all the European cities
he visited. Berlin struck him as
being very modern. However, he
pointed out, the city does not con-
tain skyscrapers, as the American
cities do. .

Hats Off to tire Baml

Robert L. Arthur, director of the University’s Varsity
Marching Band, along with the other individuals having a

‘ part in this year’s group, have succeeded in forming another

outstanding‘organization. The 120 piece outﬁt again stole‘
the spotlight during their initial performance at the Pitt-
West Virginia football game. At a time when Pitt rooters
were feeling somewhat dejected because of a losing score,
the band came out onto the Morgantown Field in their usual
ﬁne fashion and gave the Skyscraper U. fans something to
cheer about. They lived up to their traditionally high
standards with outstanding marching,~intricate formations,
and ﬁne playing.

It’s a well-known fact that Pitt’s band rates as one of
the best in the country, an even more amazing achievement
when it is realized that, the group is operating without
scholarships and a school of music like equal musical or-
ganizations. Its excellence comes entirely from hard work,
long hours of practice, and each individual’s desire to pro-
duce the best.

The Athletic Department has reported that this year’s
band wil again be in front of the student cheering section
instead of in the end zone as was the case last year. There
couldn’t be better news for Pitt students interested in a
lively well-organized cheering section. The disadvantages
of the band sitting away from the student body have been
hashed and rehashed. One of the problems of school spirit
at football games seems to center around where the band
is sitting., With the organization back where it belongs, the
problem may be solved. One thing is certain, however.
There’ll be plenty of cheering when the band’s on the ﬁeld.

‘Does Stevenson Double -Talk‘ . . 

About the Draft?         

By Irv Rothman

When Adlai Stevenson recently envisioned the
end of the draft, he did not conﬂict with his earlier
statements that we are nearing war. Instead he
suggested a reevaluation of the transient drafted
army we now ‘sponsor as well as a reevaluation of
our foreign policy which has brought us into the

present crises. -
Mr. Stevenson actually said,

“We can now anticipate the pos- 

sibility . . hopefully but responsi-
bly . . . that within the foresee-
able future we can maintain the
military forces we need without
a draft.”

According to the Governor, the
problem of technological warfare
in which we are now engaged
must be conducted on a profes-

Autliorities in Agreement

Highest military authorities have themselves
stated that we cannot meet the demands of tech-
nical warfare until we can assure ourselves of
soldiers willing to stay in the service long enough
to get the needed training and then to put it into
practice. The problem is not only to train soldiers,

but to keep them.

Says Stevenson, “It is clear that a draft army, in
which men serve very limited tours of duty, cannot
meet the specialized requirements of our rapidly

changing military technology.
Public Relations Aspect

‘As I see it, another reason for such a standing
army is that of public relations. To many of our
European and Asiatic friends, American troops have

  

 

 

«become abominable in their manners and actions—-
olfensive enough to warrant zoning laws and troop
conﬁnement. ‘

Yet most of the trouble stems from soldiers who 2
feel too little obligation to the ranks to control‘
themselves “away from home.”

Professional soldiery, with means and family
life equal to comparative status in civilian jobs in
the States, would feel as obligated in the service ‘a ”
as businessmen toward a client. They would ﬁnd it
necessary and proﬁtable to maintain cordial rela-
tions with citizens in American base areas.

Thus we would beneﬁt from a professional army,
technologically and public relations-wise.

But the modernization of our army requires also
the streamlining of a foreign policy which has in
recent years stressed defense and not economic. 
solvency. . 

sional level with highly trained technicians and
specialists providing a suﬁﬁcient core for eﬁicient
operation.

Stresses and Strains

The present administration, has placed far more
stress on military agreements than on economic or
technological aid. Our policy is one of short—sighted
alliances rather than practical economic reciprocity.
Mr. John Foster Dulles can now boast that we have
security pacts with 42 nations.

The results: The “Geneva spirit” failed not be- '
cause our President was not a leader. He was and
is inspirational to peoples throughout the world.
What caused it to flop was our ﬁne words across
the table and our military machinations beneath;
in this aspect we were equal to the Russians .
although since the conference we have proven
slower.

Less emphasis on the military and more on real
peace would permit smaller armed forces. \

No, Mr. Stevenson did not conﬂict when he
advocated a reevaluation of the draft; for he en-
visioned a new foreign policy that would demand a
new concept of the armed forces.

Politicians and UMT. .. .

By Ed Bacliman

The Suez crisis has recently
brought to light a situation which,
justly, should make about one-
fourth of Pitt’s male enrollment
shake in their boots. This is the
f a c t, brought
t 0 th e f 0 r e 5
last week, that f:
in the event of '
a shooting war 
the ﬁrst men ,
to go to the _
front will be ]'
veterans who
have already 
survived one
or two con-
ﬂicts.

The reason ,
given: the inadequacy of our
highly-touted armed forces re-
serve program, a plan which has
fallen woefully behind in giving
this nation a trained nucleus
ready to serve during any emer-
gency.

As one of the approximately
3,500 veterans attending Pitt, this
reporter just can’t fathom the
._thin shell of security created by
America’s just-exposed inadequ-
cies. Nor, it is certainly imagined,
do any of the other 3,500 relish
being. called up to serve again
unless an absolute all-‘out war
faces the United States of
America. '

But suppose we have another
Korea? Or a conﬂict even small-
er than that? Under an adequate
reserve program, such as was
planned earlier, we would have
a ﬁghting force ready for action
immediately. But with no such
supply on hand, the nation would
be forced to call up, by special
draft or what have you, the men
who have had training, have
fought wars, are specialists in
the complicated process of a
shooting conﬂict.

Better Futures
Where are these men now?

i» Many, like us at Pitt, are pur-

suing higher education in an at-
tempt to better our futures. Some
of our veterans have started up
their own businesses, businesses
which would falter if the men
were called away again. Some
have high paying jobs or are just

 

Vets In Another War?

starting to hit their peak at work.
Many are leaders in their com-
munities and nation. Most vet-
erans are married, with families
to support, mortgages to pay oﬁ‘,
other responsibilities to meet.
Some of these men fought in
World War II, only to be called
upon to ﬁght again when South
Korea was invaded in 1950.

By modern ﬁghting standards,
most of these men are tired old
men, and don’t deservethe situa-
tion suddenly thrust into the
limelight. As the Pittsburgh Press
said recently, “This country is
not playing fair with a large
group of men who deserve better
from us.”

certainly no substitute for UMT.
The only service which is tak- ,

ing men via the draft at present‘)
is the Army. So our young men
now face the following future
upon high school graduation: two
years in the Army by being
drafted; three to four years in
the Navy, Air Force, Marines or
Army by enlisting; or a delay
for a few years while they ﬁnish
college before fulﬁlling their
service obligations.‘

With a plan like UMT sound-
ing so good on paper, what then
has kept it from its much-needed
initiation? The main reason is
public opinion. Mothers want
their 17- and 18-year-old sons at

Boys Not Ready

All this while we face a fact
which belies any need for our
veterans. Approximately 1,300,-
000 boys arrive at military age
each year. These are boys much
better equipped physically and
mentally to defend their country.
But with the present systems
employed by the nation, these
boys could never be trained and
ready in time for any immediate
emergency.

What’s the answer? The an-
swer is available in a plan which
has been kicked around for
years, but continues to grow dust.
This plan is Universal Military
Training. Basically, UMT would
take all-physically ﬁt boys when
they graduated from high school
and give them specialized train-
ing for a period of about six
months. At the end of this period
-——certainly a short time out of
a boy’s life--he would be re-
leased back to civilian life with
no_ obligations tied to him, un-

less the nation faces a shooting _

W81‘. '

Trained Nucleus

Should such a war occur, we
would have a trained nucleus of
millions, what with the 1,300,000
boys taking the training each
year. During a conflict such as
Korea, only a handful of this
force would be needed. But the
main thing; we would have a
powerful group of trained men
ready, if ever needed.

oRight now these same boys

‘face the draft, but the draft is

home. But too little information‘ 

has been given to the nation. If
handled sensibly, animosity tow-
ard the plan would practically
vanish.

But with the animosity there
at present, our politicians are
afraid to bring UMT up ‘for rec-
ommendation, for fear of jeop-
ardizing those al-precious votes.
For the sake of the nation, we
appeal to Ike and/or Adlai to
consider this,important subject.

Shows Enthusiasm
Akin to Freshmen
In Taking Position

By IRV JACOBS

Among the fourteen hun-
dred freshmen at Pitt this
fall is an “experienced college
man”-—also a “Freshman” at
Pitt. Though he served for
eight years in a similar ca-
pacity at the University of Ala-
bama, Rabbi Henry A. Fischel,
Pitt’s new director of Hillel pre-
fers to call himself a freshman at
his new post.

Possessing an enthusiasm akin
to that of an entering freshman,
Rabbi Fischel, in taking a job
“much different from that at Ala-
bama,” might indeed be classiﬁed
as a freshman at Pitt.

At Alabama, where almost all

of the 500 Jewish students active-

ly participate, Hillel is one of the
strongest organizations on cam-
pus. There, the Hillel facilities,
which include a fully equipped
modern building, are used exten-
sively for fraternity and soror-

.. ity affairs.

Dr. Fischel, though he has

a keen interest in working with
the fraternities at Pitt, feels
that Hillel should not compete
with or duplicate fraternity ac-
tivities. “But we do believe
that fraternity men have a
soul,” he stated, and it is inthe
direction of cultural and spirit-
ual fulﬁllment that he wishes

to steer the Hillel ship at Pitt.’
Included in his ideas is the in-
auguration of a “Creative Hour”
at Pitt during which talented stu-

dents will be encouraged to pre-
sent -an original piece of literature,
music, or other unpublished crea-
tive work before an audience of
students and professors, to be ob-
jectively discussed.

Another plan is to publish as an
Hillel project a “Jewish History
of Pittsburgh” in conjunction with
the Pittsburgh Bicentennial in
1957. The latter, requiring an ex-
tensive amount of research, will
serve as an excellent outlet for
the creative ability of interested
Pitt students, Jews and non-Jews
alike.

Hillel at Pitt needs not nec-
essarily be limited to Jewish
students, Rabbi Fischel believes.

LEADER of the Hillel organization is Rabbi Henry A. Fischel.
The Rabbi was formerly with the University of Alabama where
he also worked with Hillel for eight years.
that Hillel should necessarily be limited to Jewish students but
sees" beneﬁts in non-Jewish membership as well.

“and aids in promoting interfaith

 

 

He does not believe

At Alabama, for instance, there
were considerable numbers of
non-Jewish students who took
part in Hillel activities. Any
students who wished to use the
Hillel facilities or to participate
in certain programs along with
‘their Jewish friends were per-
mitted to join.

Of course, non-Jews are en-
couraged to retain membership in
t h e i r o w n religion-sponsored
groups. However, there is a cer-
tain advantage in such mixed
memberships, for it leads to ob-
‘jective comparisons of religions

programs.

Harriers   Open  Against Titans-

Moore, Sm—1'—t—I.-1., H arford
Carry Panther Hopes

By MICHAEL GERBER J

On Saturday morning at 10 lp.m., the Panther IC4A
champion cross—country team opens its 1956 season against
comparatively weak Westminster. The meet will be run over
the Schenley Park course.

The Panther harriers expect little more than a good
workout from theyoung and inexperienced Titans, but Coach
Carl Olson will be watching his runners closely, as the men
who do best in this meet and in the Slippery Rock meet
will be the ones chosen to make the trip to Annapolis, Oc-

tober 6, for the triangular meeté
with Navy and Villanova.

Coach Olson is counting on
two veterans, Jimmy Moore and
Thorton Smith, to be the Pan-
thers’ outstanding performers
this year. He is also expecting
big things of miler Wendell
Harford, and hopes that his
versatile track man, Ed Saun-

The Panthers have been prac-
ticing on their own since Sep-
tember 4 with the ﬁrst regular

practice session being held only
last Monday.

The Westminster Titans have
a new coach this year in David
Colton, who previously coached
at Geneva. Colton, who is also
Westminster’s publicity direc-
tor, claims that his team is
young and inexperienced, but he
nevertheless expects to improve
on last year’s 2-4 record.

Colton will send seven runners
against the Blue and Go1d—these
being Jim Osuna, a senior; Acey
Jackson, a junior; sophomores
Jerry Paul, Pete Marshall, Bob
Patton, and Mark Kenndell; and

 

   

but says he has the makings of
a good team, which he thinks can
capture the Tri-State champion-
ship next year.

Unfortunate is the fact that two
standouts, Perry Jones and Paul
Jessup, are scholastically ineligi-
ble.

Fresh Begin Hard Work
AnticipatingToughCard

By CHRIS GILLOTTI

While the rest of the student body spent Monday celebra-
ting the Panther’s hard earned victory over West Virginia,
Coach Steve Petro’s freshmen squad went through its ﬁrst
‘day of rugged, dirtschewing practice. .

The Panther Cubs dressed at the Stadium and trotted
onto Trees- Field at 4 p.m. With Coach Petro running beside
them and warning them to “watché
out’ cutting them corners,” the
boys did loosening-up laps around
the grass-covered ﬁeld.

Then they ﬂopped to the ground
as big Seraﬁno Fazio, All-W.P.I.
A.L. center from Coraopolis took
charge for calisthenics.

Moans and Groans

They groaned as they held their
legs eight inches off the ground.
They moaned as they swung their
legs back over their heads and
kicked up dirt. They grunted as
they strained through slow, per-
fectly executed push-ups. (“C’mon,
touch your chest, touch your
chest!”) But they still hustled as

. they lined up for wind sprints.

When Petro was satisﬁed with
their charging, they split up in-
to three groups. Petro himself
stayed with the guards and

~ tackles. He stripped off his jac-
ket and went to work on the
blocking dummy. (“You run at
the man just like you’re going to
tackle him, then wham, you
throw the block.”) ‘The boys
watched their teacher and de-
terminedly tried to imitate him.

Big Dick Deitrick, looking more
like a misplaced professor than a
line coach, took the ends aside and
started them on the road to ﬁlling
the spikes of John Paluck and Joe
Walton.

  

assistant Frank Kacher were kept
busy bringing out equipment and
dodging out of the way of hard-
charging blue and gold uniforms.

By six o’clock the day would

be ended, however, and the tired
bunch would make it to Ells-
worth Center for dinner, to stare
at lauded varsity and dream
“maybe someday . . ."

So went the ﬁrst day of prac-
tice for the freshmen. Tomorrow it
would be a little more familiar
and a little easier. In two weeks
it would be a habit, and by the
time the opening game with Penn
State rolls around in a month, all
this practice will have been turned
into a way of life.

toter entered the game after the
ﬁrst touchdown and kicked the
extra point that put the Jungle
Cats into a 7-6 lead.

He then kicked off and when
Mountie halfback Ralph Anastasio
fumbled, guess who was there?
That is right; it was Bugs. For
those two key plays Bugs was re-
warded with his seat on the bench
again. He never returned to the
lineup. Five plays later, right-
half Nick Passodelis of Aliquippa
scored the second Panther touch-
down. The locals eventually won,
14-13.

Going back to 1954 when Am-
brose was just a sophomore, we
ﬁnd that it was-the same Mr.
Bagamery who helped the Oak-
landers upset the Lewismen.

In that clash Bugs caught a pass
for one touchdown and added an
extra point with his right toe. The

Personally, Bugs has nothing
against the Mountaineers because
he also helped the Panthers pull
one of the biggest upsets of the
1954 season when an underdog
Panther eleven edged Navy, 21-
19. Who kicked the three extra
points? That’s right -— Bugs Ba-
gamery.

 

Fraternity Section
Football to Start

The ﬁrst of four intra-mural
touch football leagues, the Fra-
ternity section, will get under way
next Monday, Oct. A1.

After a meeting held yesterday,
Leo Bemis, head of all intra-
mural athletics, announced that 16
fraternities would enter teams in
the league which last year pro-
duced the Inter-City champs, Pi
Kappa Alpha.

Concerning the other three
leagues, Bemis said that the Inde-
pendent, the Engineering, and the
Professional School circuits will
probably begin action the week of
Oct. 8.

Last season the passing com-
bination of Dale Chovan to Jerry
Fisher led the PiKA’s to a sweep
of all opponents. While en route
to the City championship, they
downed Delta Sigma Phi, 25-6,
for the IF title and then shut out
the dental fraternity, Delta Sigma
Delta, 25-0, for the Campus
crown. A

The schedule will be run much
the same this year as in 1955.
After approximately two and a
half months of rugged competi-
tion, each city college will enter
its top team in the play-offs.

Because a Pitt squad is the
reigning titlist, this year’s Pitt
winner will be given a bye into
the ﬁnals against the winner of

Jim Brown Leads

  Strong Orangemen

. Into Grudge Clash

By AL PELAEZ

Noah Webster, -usually held
as a model of conservatism,
surprised the football world
this week by boldly declaring
that Saturday will not be the
Orangemen’s_ day. In fact,

Webster states in his Unabridged
Dictionary that July 12 is cele-
brated as Orangemen’s day and
apparently thinks that the Panth-
ers have little to fear this partic-
ular Weekend. P

Coach John Michelosen, how-
ever, has decided to completely
disregard the advice of the afore-
mentioned scholar and has been
running his charges through a
series of tough practice sessions
this week.

Michelosen was extremely dis-
satisﬁed with the way the Panthl
ers performed at Morgantown last
week and has several weaknesses
"in both his offense and defense to
eliminate before Saturday’s con-
test.

No More Pep Talks

One consolation for Big Mike is
that pep talks won’t be necessary
to ﬁre up the Panthers after the
way the Orangemen rolled over
perenially tough Maryland.

Syracuse’s head mentor Floyd
Schwartzwalder, on the other
hand, thinks that Webster def-
initely knew what he was talk-
ing about. Schwartzwalder de-
clared that “Pittsburgh showed
plenty of. power in defeating us
a year ago (22-12) and we ﬁg-
ure them to be even tougher
this season.” ‘

Although Schwartzwalder’s pes-
simism sounds genuine enough a
quick examination of the facts
uncovers a flaw in Syracuse’s un-
derdog role —— namely Jim Brown.

 

JIM BROWN
Outgained Terps on ground

* *‘ *

Brown, a speedy, elusive halfback
with the power of a fullback,
specializes in out-gaining most
opposing teams in total yards
gained rushing.

lAll-American Brown

Not only is Brown a threat
when running the ball, but he’s an
excellent pass, receiver and, a
strong defensive link in the
Orangemen’s backﬁeld. Brown,
along with the Panthers’ Joe Wal-
ton are rated as the East’s only
bonaﬁde All-American candidates.

Supporting Brown will be a.
cast of 17 lettermen including
halfback‘ Jim Ridlon, end Dick
Lassee, tackle Jerry Cashman

   

Zimmerman Lets
New York Fans
Forget Albright

and another Brown—Bill.
Ridlon, who led the Orangemen
in pass receiving last season was
shifted to the backﬁeld this sea-
son and has been playing the posi-
tion like a pro. Ridlon’s ﬁne run-
ning has taken much of the pres-
sure off Brown and he is also the
best blocker in the Orange back-
ﬁeld. Against Maryland he even
completed a touchdown pass —
quite a trick for an ex-end.
Watch Wingman Lasse
Lasse, a top pass receiver
should‘ give the Panther secondary
some anxious moments Saturday
along with Brown — Bill —- who
specializes in breaking up the op-
position plays from his linebacker
position. Observers at last Sat-
urday’s Maryland game‘ were ‘al-
most unanimous in their selection
of tackle Jerry Cashman as the
outstanding lineman on the ﬁeld.
Bolstering this array of num-
eral winners will be _several sop-
homores working with the varsity
for the ﬁrst time. One of them,
Chuck Zimmerman, may make the
New Yorkers forget about Eddie
Albright — their star quarterback
who graduated last year —— soon-
er than they ever thought they
would.
Zimmerman ran Syracuse’s
_tricky razzle-dazzle type of of-
fense with the poise and calm-
ness of a veteran against :Zary-
land and gives promise of de-
veloping into an even better
player than Albright was.
Before the season started Coach
Schwartzwalder said that “If our
quarterback problem is ﬁlled we
may make a few people sit up and
take notice this season.” Saturday
afternoon about 50,000 people are
going to “sit up and take notice”
of Syracuse as they tackle the
team they must beat to be recog-
nized as the best team in the East.

Traveling Swamis
Keep Traveling;
Michelosen Lost

Those ingenious seers, other-
wise known as the Pitt -News
Yogis, became so stunned last
week when the Mountaineers
almost beat the Panthers that
they immediately leaped from
Mountaineer Field into, their
anchored ouija boards and set
sail for Pittsburgh.

At last report they were head-
ed for the swamp lands of
Arkansas where they are tak-
ing in the “Game of the Weak”
between the Ouachita Tigers
and the Ozark Mountaineers.

They had intentions of stop-

ping to view the Syracuse game
but suddenly decided to attend
the night game between Ouach-
ita and Ozark.
’ . When Coach Michelosen was
informed of the switch he leap-
ed from the speeding craft
around the Point bridge clutch-
ing the selections for this Sat-
urday’s games. The picks were
found washed ashore in Pa.-
ducah. Michelosen is yet to be
heard from.

Meanwhile, backﬁeld coach
Vic Fusia has taken over the
spot held by the disappearance
of Michelosen. The skipper’s last

 

words were, “If I ever needed
you I need you now.”

The SS Otus dispatched the
selections which show Miami
(Fla.), Michigan, Penn State,
Princeton, and Georgia Tech to
win in a romp.

Darrell Lewis, still in a trance
over the failure of the search-
ers to locate his coach, failed to
pick his team to win. In fact
Lewis was so nervous he was
last seen ﬂoating down the Ohio
River on a raft.

Ed (Man in Motion) Koltiska,
bewildered by his stupendous
selections of a week ago that
have so rudily put him in last
place in the twisted turban ses-
sions, has just purchased a Foot-
ball Selectrograph. Says Ed,
“I’m sure Ozark quarterback
Otus Swamps will slush his way
to a victory.”

Drawing to Close
WQED, Pittsburgh’s Education-

week of its 1956 campaign for"
operating funds on Monday. The
goal of the station’s fall drive
which started on Sept. 4 and will
(3nd Oct. 5, is $200,000.

Public support of this cam-
paign is being asked by WQED
in_ Allegheny County and the
surrounding nine-county area,
though the strength of Channel
13’s signal reaches beyond this
area.

WQED was the first educational
station in the country to go to
higher power, having increased
its strength over ﬁve times on
Aug. 29.

The non-commercial enterprise
receives funds. and foundation as-
sistance in and for special pro-
gramming and its related needs,
but WQED still depends greatly
on the members of the community
for its broad—based support.

General chairman for the 1956
fall campaign is Edward J. Magee.
