Whether records will be broken

diately determined, because both
men were freshmen last year and
had little chance to enter compe-
tition.

Coach Olson will have the ma-

jority of the squad entered, and
they should be favorites" to win
the meet if recent performances
are indicative of victory.

The ﬁfty men who competed in
the Junior meet were able to vest
the team title without much trou-
ble, and against the better of the
district squads.

After last week’s Knights of Co-
lumbus meet in Cleveland, Olson

revealed Pitt may have won eith-I

er the mile or the two mile relay
title. if he had concentrated eight
men into a solid front in both
events.

“We took seconds in both ‘re-

lays regardless of who’ ran. All_

that mattered was that eight men
got the experience needed."
