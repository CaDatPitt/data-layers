Pittsburgh Publisher —

The, publisher who has brought
out this book is a Pittsburgh pub-
lisher, Dr. Ralph Buchsbaum, pro-
fessor of zoology at‘Pitt. He has
recently started a press called‘ the
Boxwood Press, “strictly as a
hobby,” he said.

He expects to publish-only spe-

cial books which seem to him to be ,

of permanent value. Books which
Boxwood Press has published so
far include Lab Studies in the Bio-
logical Sciences, used in zoology 3,
and ‘written by Dr. Buchsbaum;
and now “Prometheus in Pitts-
burgh.” P" '

Mr. Lee hopes that Prometheus
will be stagedfor the-ﬁrst time in
Stephen Foster _Memorial. It is
possible, however, he said, that "the
University College, Dublin, Ire-

is done in Pittsburgh.

SC ls Plastered 

with $137331   . 

1%-CR Damage 

By DAVE GREEN _ I .

Student Congress» looked at its ﬁnancial account Monday, ’ 5'7

and wondered why it got socked with a $137 bill fo_rf“Com-  '

mons Room destruction.”

Treasurer Dan ‘Burger said thath

\

why the University Bursar_has ex-¢, . ,
Phi Eta Sigma could be considered .

tracted that amount from the Con-
gress account since no action by
Congress had been taken on it and

thorized the payment.

He said that he had been in-
formed that while Men’s Council
has been charged $55 for the same
reason, WSGA has not yet been
billed for any similar item.

Independent Funds

Dan Berger said that “our own
funds are one of the few things
over which; we have independ-
ence,” and advocated looking into
the reasons for the billing.

Oﬁicials could not be reached
for ‘comment.

Action was taken on the request
of Phi Eta Sigma, honorary scho-_
lastic fraternity for freshman men
to become a regularly represented
group in Student Congress. Con-.
gress‘ President Jack Burwinkel
said that the lettervwas considered
in executive committee and ex-
plained that under the present con-
stitution of SC, ‘no representatives
of activities are given voting priv-
ileges. He added that under the
proposed revision of the constitu-
tion, student groups would be
given representation. He said that

legislators moved that Phi Eta ‘ - it

Sigma be invited to send an of-
ﬁcial observer having no vote. In
the course of debate on the motion,
it was altered to read that all cam-

pus groups be asked to send ob- .

servers, and the motion _was
passed. ‘
>The legislators received a deﬁ-

/ nite “no” to their request to hold

an SC retreat on the twelfth ﬂoor.
The group had planned to prepare
its own meal in the twelfth ﬂoor
kitchen, but officials of the dean
of Women’s staff deemed the pro-
posal “not feasible.”
Typewriters Not Available

Adele Marriccini mentioned the
fact that the typewriters on the
twelfth ﬂoor are no longer .availa-
ble to men students. She explain-

_ Anywhere University activ-
ities are held, there you’ll ﬁnd,
in the midst of all the con-
fusion and gaiety, Mr. Joseph
Hedges and Mr. Harry Berry,
marshall and assistant mar-
shall of Pitt. ,

As marshalls, Mr; Berry and
Mr. Hedges are directly responsi-
ble to the dean of men’s oﬂice. It
is their job to establish and main-
tain standards of conduct that are
complimentary to college men and
women, and—when necessary-
they see that they are observed.

‘_ A popular misconception, Hedges
states, is that most students think
that the marshall goes around the
campus with a chip on his shoulder
enforcing. University regulations
like a‘ traﬂic cop.

Anxious to Help

"We_ are as anxious to help the
student body as they are to help
themselves,” he claims.

“We get; along with most of the .

they cooperate with us. But there
is always the joker who gets out

and the like—who make us clamp
“down,” he continued. ‘
The service touches nearly. every
phase of campus life. One of these
is the Christmas dance in the Com-
mons Roorn. ‘ "

dents working for us during the

.Tal1 6-3, 195-pound.Sutton Tait is typical
of the’ basketball players that Dr. H. C.
Carlson is using on his varsity this year.

The catch is, though, that Sutton is only
a freshman so Carlson will have to wait a year‘
before he can take him from Coach Dodo.Can-
terna’s frosh squad. .

The blond-haired eager answers any queries
‘about the difference between high school. and col-
lege play with “it’s one big jump, like the transi-
tion from a freshman to a senior.” S .

' A-1]-State Team

At,Punxsutawney,- his home town, Sutton was
a.varsity member of Coach Clarence Binney‘s

~ hoopsters for three years. - _

Last season he helped them amass a 20-1 record

5 and c1imb_'to the semi-ﬁnals of the state Class A

championships. before being eliminated by West-
inghouse High. _ '

\ Eventhough his team lost, Tait was named to,
V the All-State team and he cites this as his t0_p~
5 thrill to date.

College Tougher

The 18-year-old Tait who will major in physi-

cal education, would like t.o do graduate work
_before going into coaching.

At present, however, he’s concentrating on his
undergraduate studies and though he maintained a
“B” average in high school, he says, “college study-
ing is much harder.”

On the court, the rangy forward is often re-

-Hferred to by’ his-_tearn1mates as “The Hawk” be- _

cause of the many times he‘ broke his nose in hoop-

‘ action. ‘_ ‘-

A\ glance at last year’s score-

limited use of reserve players.

Of the ten victories the‘ previ-
ous season, only two wound up as
runaways——the rest were too close
to permit the use of anything but
the first team.

And only three or four of the
twelve losses were completely

Tight Games Force Doc ,
To Overlook Benched

_ By RUSS FRANKE

Although the 1952-53 Panthers have all the earmarks of
a good club, Doc Carlson may have to keep a lot of aspirin
handy in his medicine kit-—-for his own use. ‘

For a major headache may develop as a result of the -
lack of reserveson hand to spell off the regulars. n

One of the reasons for the downfall in the Waning mo-

ments of‘the Michigan game last Saturday was attributed"
to the apparent tiring of Panther¢

even against a couple of top teams. .

Oagers‘ NotHere I
For Health of It

 

. By BORIS VVEINSTEIN
Sports Editor Q

Almost a year ago the College President’s Committee

Council on Education made

several recommendations to the Council concerning a plan to

de—emphasize college sports.

The reasons for starting the Wholesale affair in- the ﬁrst
place, came as‘ a result of an overistressed athletic prégram.
And also, I suspect, because many scholarship athletess failed

to perform in the classroom as

creditably as they did on the ball‘

ﬁeld. .
Members of the top brass
didn’t visit the college cam-
puses during their search but
if _Pitt would have, been a.
stopover th e i r attentions
would have quickly turned
- elsewhere—maybe to draft-
ing Bonzos to play football

 

‘or something as ridiculous as that. _ _ /

Dr. H. C. Carlson would have informed the brass that “none of
our lads has a snap ‘course.” If this pleasant and startling announce-
ment failed to dent, Carlson would crate even further. '

He’ could,‘ for example, tell them that of his seven best‘ boys

' -three are pre—medicine, one is attending Dental School, "another is

anghonor studentin chemistry, and only two are phys ed majors.‘
“What? I don’t believe it,” one of the CPC’_s could argue,
“it doesn't -sound like these boys are athletes, but more like ,

scholars?’

“True, true,” Carlson could come back, and then win the darn}

debate for "his side by reciting a‘ long list" of names of.former Pitt
hoop stars who have been quite successful on the outside, as a result

of an athletic _scholarship——the same deal that the ACE has been _

trying to restrict.

Carlson hasn’t had ‘a winning season here since the 1945-46
campaign. but there is no, doubt that more? successful -_-professional
men have come_out of his lineup than from any other team.

He is moreuproud of the personnel on the undefeated 1928
team as men than players. Here’s the lineup: Dr. PaulCZehfuss,

eye specialist" in‘ Washington, D.

C.; Sykes Reed, dentist in‘Har- —

Brack; Stan Wrobleskie, personnel worker for Goodyear; Paul
Fisher, Pittsburgh engineer; Gym Wunderlich, councilman and
teacher ‘in Donora; Walter Sarraf, Aﬂrebrick company executive;

Jim Patton, Pittsburgh dentist;

Charley Hyatt, Western sales

representative for an athleticgoods company; Chester Sandberg,

a Pittsburgh dentist.

his criticism of the shift by Jor-

pathizers opposed. the ﬁve-yard
line angle, but he would not label
it as an unsportsmanlike move.
“We never waited until we got
deep into the oppositionfs territory
before we used it,” he .continued.

“The shift is part of our offense ‘

and we used it all over the ﬁeld.

There isnothing in the rule book

to prevent it”. p ‘
Que of Those Things

The redhead was asked how he

would react if his team would lose‘

a close game because of a shift as
Hill’s Southern Californians did.
“There’s really_litj(_le I could say,”

said Dawson. “I guess you’d have ~

to classify it as justonc of those
things. The linemen sholild be
warned against such occurrences:
and I don’t doubt that Southern

California’s linemen were warned.”

Merts Outlast
Indians, 4:0-37
,Mert Five, last year’s Indepen-
dent League champs, started the
season off on the right foot Mon-
day night, edging the Sewickley
Indians, 40-A37. '
Paul Blanda’,

player, showed he was equally
adept with the round ball. The

.Mert pivot man bagged 20 points,

most of them on lay ups, how-
ever.

Stu Evans ‘opened the scoring
for the Mert men with a field goal
from the foul circle. Blanda hit
for two by way of a bunny and

the Green-and-Gold rolled to a .

10--3 lead by the quarter.

The Indians came to life in the
second quarter with four of their
ﬁve men scoring. They held the
Mert club to ﬁve points and col-
lected twelve themselves to take-
a 15-14 lead at the half.

It was nip and tuck through the
whole second half with the In-
dians extending their lead, 29-26,
at the third quarter.

Mert’s boys got. hot at this point,
though, and ﬁnally overhauled the
Indians, 35-33, with two minutes
left.

The Indians made a last effort,
nﬁting four points, but a set shot
by Tex Yexr kept the lead for the
Merts. ‘

He must have told a joke about
the Communists because one night
he disappeared. We ﬁnally found

-out he had been put on a train to

Siberia. His ‘apartment and all his
belongings were ruined. I remem-
ber he had a wonderful stamp col-
lection. The Communists took
that.

“We found out our-.~-family was
next on the list. To escape, we
moved to an entirely different
place in northern Latvia.

Nazis Better Than Commies

“_In 1941, the Germans ecaxne by
surprise and the Redswere forced
out of Latvia. Then the Commun-
ists came back and"forced out the
Nazis. At that time, 1944, the Ger-
mans took my family along to
Germany to" work for them. At
ﬁrst, we felt glad to escape the
Communists. The Germans were‘

, bad, but nothing to compare with

the Reds. .

“II we had been "left in Latvia,
we would have been_ killed, be-
cause we did not belong to the
Communist Party.” .

The Fridenbergs ’were having a

little party one night. Emily re-~
collects, _“We had big, beautiful,

windowsin our] living room. Sud-
denly th'rou'gh,;the glass I could

Came Here in 1951
In "March of 1951, a Lutheran
Church organization sponsored th‘e
Fridenberg’s trip from Germany
to New York. . - -
The United States, Emily feels,
is much like her pre-war home in
Latvia. 3. '
“Sometimes I think about home,
but not as much as my father and
—mother do. After all, a child very
soon forgets. :Anyhow,- I am no
longer a Leatviaﬁn; I am trying to be
as good an American as I- can.”
Emily seems to have no’ trouble
with - the English language. 5 She

says" that English was taught in

the German high schools. \

“I got my ii-rst papers in June
of 1952. In four years, I will be a
citizen,” she says proudly. “I can’t
wait to vote.”

Emily Fridenberg has learned to
