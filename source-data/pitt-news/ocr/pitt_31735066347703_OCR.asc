News Analysis

Administrators Optimistic Pitt BudgetWi|| Increase  

By RICH HAJKRY

High ranking University admin-
istrators are optimistic Pitt will
receive state appropriations in
excess of the $61.9 million
recommended by Governor Milton
Shapp, but -student leaders are

1, evaluating measures for combatting

what may be the third tuition hike in
as many years.

9 In separate interviews recently,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar and Vice
Chancellors Jack Freeman and Joe
Dutton agreed Pitt presented “a
strong and sympathetic ” case for
increased state funding at the
House and Senate appropriation
committee hearings last month, but
if the legislators approve Shapp’s

J’ recommendation with little or no

modiﬁcation, the University will be
forced to pare a budget generally
considered “cut to the bone” and
increase what is already one of the
highest tuition rates of state-sup-
ported schools in the_country.

The University received in-
creased state funding the past ‘few
years, but Vice-Chancellor of
Budget and Planning Jack Freeman
said inﬂation has consumed those
appropriations, minimizing any
increase in constant dollars.

Black Student Study Planned By Federal Regulations

Chancellor Wesley Posvar »-an-
nounced last week the formation of
a University-wide, 33-member task
force to examine the situation of
black students at Pitt. V

Posvar said the task force, made
up of faculty, students and staff, is
charged with examining the con-
cerns of Pitt’s black students as they
relate to University processes,
identifying major problems with the
realization of social justice and
equality of opportunity and making
recommendations for resolution of
the identified problems.

“The University has been com-

Iﬁ mitted to a ﬁrm policy of social

justice and has established several
units and programs designed to

address this high priority,” Posvar .

said. .

Joel Reed, director of the
University-Community Education
Program (U-CEP), was selected to
be the task force chairperson. Joyce
Alexander, of Pitt’s (Counseling
Center and assistant professor of
educational psychology, is the
assistant chairperson.

Reed said the University is
committed to providing increased
access to black students, but that no
systematic examination of Pitt's
program has been undertaken
recently.

‘ ‘We believe that in our attempts
Q to identify concerns that affect black

students we may well identify

tﬁprobleme areas that affect all

If state legislators follow past
trends, Pitt will receive more than
Shapp’s recommendation, but to
avoid any budgetary cutbacks and
tuition increase the University
mandates its original request of
$69.5 million.

Although the degree of budget-
ary cutbacks hinges on the ﬁnal

_amount appropriated by the legis-

lature, administrative services,
including secretarial and custodial
employment, would be one area
standing the greatest chance of
being eliminated in part from the
budget, Freeman said, if cutbacks
follow in line with those in past
years. ’

“These cutbacks impose some
burdens, but despite the austeri-
ties, people will grow to accept they

are something we have to do

without,” Freeman said.

The University in the last two
years has internally reallocated $7
million towards , high priority pro-
grams, trimming a substantial
amount of the budget in the
process, Freeman said, and as a
result most programs were not cut
from the budget.

“We started to cut into faculty
vacancies by simply not ﬁlling
them, cutting $3.5 million the past

students and work out recommend-
ations that will beneﬁt all, ” he said.

The task force is divided into
seven subcommittees: admissions,
recruitment and ﬁnancial

counselling, placement and study
skills development, University en-
vironment, administrative policies,

two years,” Freeman said. “How
long this can continue is problem-
atical; major programs may even-
tually need to be examined.”

I Currently under review in
Freeman’s office are budget
evaluations from each of the
University’s 16 schools and Free-
man said ﬁnal recommendations
are forthcoming. The University

tion and retention,- and graduate

The task force membership will
call upon individuals from through-
out the University on a consulting

basis to serve as resource persons A

for the particular subcommittees.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar said in an interview he is optimistic the state

Iegnslature‘s appropriation to Pitt will increase over the Governor’s proposed
budget. Yet his staff is investigating all potential areas for cutbacks to limit a

tuition hike.

Credit Equality Insured  9]

By BETSY NORMAN

Almost every wallet in the United
States holds at least one credit
card—either a Master‘ Charge,
Diner’s Club or BankAmericard.
The U.S. economy is dependent on

credit,‘ according to Pittsburgh’s
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) Executive Director Ellen
Doyle.

‘ ‘The extension or denial of credit
usually influences a _person’s
financial stability; determining
whether they can buy a car, own a
house, obtain a loan or send a child
to college. Until 1975, married
women were denied financial
credit; only a woman’s husband
could obtain credit,” Doyle said.

In October 1975,. this was
changed when the Federal Equal
Opportunity Credit Act was insti-
tuted. This act prohibits any
discrimination on the basis of sex or
marital‘ status in any credit
transaction.

The act covers all forms of credit
including charge accounts, credit
cards, mortgages and other bank
loans, and farm and business
investment loans.

The Equal Opportunity Credit
Act prohibits creditors from making
statements discouraging a “reas-
onable” person from applying for
credit, refusing a person permission
to open a separate account on the
basis of marital status and asking

Freeman said the severity of
eventual cutbacks would vary,
within each school and would not
specify which school would be most
severely crippled byfurther bud-
getary cutbacks although he
pointed out the medical school is
“on the rocks and dare not make
any more severe cutbacks.”

He said the medical school
imposed a school-wide salary freeze
last year to minimize the effects of

. zero increase in state appropria- *

tions and it appears the University
may take a hard look at salary
increases within the University’s
overall economic picture. .
“We are very concerned about
giving out salary increments similar
to those elsewhere. to faculty and

clerical staff here,” Joseph Dutton, _

Vice Chancellor of Budget 9‘ and
Finance, said. “If we don’t, we’ll

WASHINGTON (AP).-Secre-

declined to rule out U.S. miscalcu-

rejection of American strategic
arms limitation proposals.

“No one can say that one never

told reporters yesterday after
giving President Carter his first
formal, face-to-face assessment of
the arms negotiations in Moscow.

Carter said the United States
remains determined “to succeed if

Both Dutton and Freeman said

budget would have A an adverse
affect on the educational quality
here. “For example,” Freeman
said, “if we need to eliminate a

The administrators stressed that

since 1972, would be a last resort in

“The administration always
considers raising tuition as a last

proposition but a matter of
degree, ” Posvar said, adding it was
too early to speculate on the amount
of a hike although “some degree of
increase is regrettably highly
likely.”

He suggested students person-

“constructive persuasion and argu-
ment” for voting in favor of
increased appropriations.

“Whatever campaign we under-
take, it must be on a one-to-one

basis with students talking to their

personally know in a sympathetic
manner seeking friendly support,”
Posvar said. i“A legislator is
extremely interested in what his

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

 

One Step Too Far  

Paul Nyden, Yusef Ali and the protests their followers stage
create as much trouble for the University as a flea does to a camel.-
Fleas are not fatal, but this camel called Pitt is going to far too
much trouble to get rid of one flea.

The temporary injunction to prevent occupation of buildings and
disruption of normal campus operations goes one step too far and
destroys the spirit of Nyden’s and Ali’s opposition. ~

Anything done on t_he behalf of Drs. Nyden and Ali can be
misconstrued as disruption of normal operation, whether this be
one person on a corner standing’ on the top of a soapbox or a
group on a Cathedral walkway passing out leaflets.

An injunction to prevent occupation of anoffice can be
understood, butnot condoned. But to make that a temporary
injunction and include a nebulous clause about the disruption of
normal operation makes Pitt look more like a corporate entity than

an institution of higher learning.

The current repair of the Cathedral steps, with jackhammers and
backhoe, noisily disrupts Pitt-’s daily operation. V Yet there is no
injunction, no objection, because this repair is a sort of plastic
surgery to improve the face that Pitt presents to the real world.

Perhaps the administration feels it accomplishes the same by
silencing Nyden, Ali and their followers.

Everyone who is a part of this institution of higher learning,
from ‘the Chancellor on down to the janitors, everyone who
contributes something to makePitt unique, is as integral a part of
Pitt as the block supporting the foundation of the Cathedral of

Learning.

For a group’ of people, with the aid of a court

injunction, to start marking off areas as places where others are

/_.

-forbiddento express themselves destroys this institutional spirit. a

Business entities speak through court injunctions. Institutions

of higher learning do not. »

And when abusiness entity wants to get something done, the
whole matter is rubber-stamped through variousjcommittees until
the objective is reached. The only consensus of opinion considered
is that of those leading, even in the most inconsequential matters.
The University of Pittsburgh has been in the education business‘ for
nearly 200 years. Nyden and Ali make up rather short chapters in

Pitt’s.history. v
Five years from now,

let’s hope we can look back on the

dismissal of Nyden and Ali and honestly say they were dismissed by
Pitt the institution and not Pitt the business.

E Letter

. Round-up for N yden Crew’ ’ (March

- 28, 1977), hopefully signals the last
round-up for his type of negative
journalism and misleadership
has held ‘sway for the past few
years. Such “journalists” and
“student leaders” are really
anti-student, always telling us how
stupid and apathetic students are.
He has become so ‘inured to
undemocratic policies that he
laughs at those who are angry and
upset. ,

But most disturbing of all, is Tom
Waseleski’s racist attitude. Over
the past month, he has written
disgusting remarks about Angela
Davis and about George Van Hook,
former BAS chairperson. He has
made vicious caricatures of black
students and black people in

. general. By criticizing all that is

good and decent, Tom Waseleski
only makes himself look disgrace-
ful.

Such old-style student leaders
seem hell bent on ‘preventing
students‘ from returning to the
1960s. True, that period died with
the killings at Kent and Jackson
State and with the end of the
Vietnam War. But another era is
also coming to a close——the

. relatively quiet period of the early

1970s. Although the Pitt News may
not have reported them, there have
been huge demonstrations on
campuses across the country—last

‘ year when 10,000 students rallied to

maintain open admissions at City
College in New York, last month
when 5,000 students protested the
ﬁring of Dr. Harry Edwards at
Berkeley and today huge anti-tui-
tion hike rallies on campuses across
Pennsylvania.

tion hikes and the new wave of racist
and political repression. But like
the 1960s, we demand more
democracy, more student voice in
how the University is run. In this,
nothing has changed.

Unfortunately, the Pitt News has
not printed our recent statement to
Chancellor Posvar, which reads in
part:

“There is much more at stake
here than two professors’ jobs. At
" issue is whether black and Marxist
professors have the freedom to
teach and whether students have
the freedomtoleam from them. At
issue is whether students and
a faculty will have a voice equal to the

» administration in questions of

faculty promotion. or whether the
present undemocratic process will
continue. At issue is the autonomy
and integrity of the black studies
department. . .

Minteer’s Tiger Burns Bright

~  

 

By MARYHALL

The Tiger ”
Pittsburgh Playhouse

‘ Directed by Maura Minteer

Maura Minteer made her.direct-

ting debut this weekend at the

Playhouse with her production of
“The Tiger,” by American play-
wright Murray Schisgal. e
The one-act play, which opened
in London with another Schisgal

‘ play, “The Typists,” in 1960, was

ﬁrst staged in this country in 1963.

 
   

Thomas D vi, sophomore at Point
park congge, plays Benjamin in
“The y.Tip§e_r’.’

The main character is a would-be
rapist whose daytime profession is
mailcarrier.

Benjamin, played by Thomas
Davie, is a bitter and socially-frus-
trated man who wanted to go to
college when he was younger but
couldn’t learn enough French toi
pass the entrance exam. His
unhappiness has made him desper-
ate and belligerent, and he refers to
himself as a Tiger (symbol of
strength and cunning).

He abducts a suburban-type
woman, Gloria, played by Maria
Barney, from a downtown street
and carries her back to his dingy
basement apartment. Once he gets
his prey to his pad, however, he
doesn’t quite know how to go

A quite salient distinction
between British “folk-rock” and its
»American counter part concerns
tradition. American “folk-rock”
draws from ” what are eclectic
sources——“hillbilly” music, blue-
grass, rural blues, early jazz and the
most derivative of genres, folk. :,_(It
‘would take at least two columns to
deﬁne the various inﬂuences in that
category. Suffice it to list Woody
Guthrie and the musical compila-
tions of the Lomax brothers as two
major currents of folk music.)

Musicians in the mid-sixties,
notably Bob Dylan and the Byrds,
integrated these backgrounds into
an electric sound that had rock and
roll as its base. They used the chord

and melody structures of folk, but
their arrangements were loud, fast
and now. \

Their music spoke to the people

who needed some sort of contemp-
orary “folk” response towhat the
Beatles were saying. (In turn, the
Beatles rejoined Dylan and his
ﬂock. In turn...)

America is a land of the eclectic

many currents, electric and other-
wise.

Britain, on the other hand, across
the ocean, is much less a pastiche of
cultures and musics. Irish, English
and Scottish folk music is not nearly
as disparate, at least to Americans,
as that of, say, Leon Redbone and
Joan Baez.

England’s culture existed years
before America’s. This history has
produced a homogeneity of thought
and an awareness of the past which
has led to a completely different
form of “folk-rock.” ‘

Listening to these groups is like
hearing the centuries-gone-by re-
invigorated, reborn; basically, re-

Richard Thompson wrote, sang
and played guitar for Fairport

pursued a solo career as well. Later,

A he married singer Linda Peters and

. They released an album in Britain

and achieved some success.

“Richard Thompson Live (More
or Less)” is a specially priced
double-record set containing that
ﬁrst album, some live cuts and
previously unreleased studio ma-
terial from Fairport Convention
days. It is an excellent collection,
heartily recommended to fans of
Fairport.

While there were similarities
between Fairport Convention and
Steeleye Span, F airport relied more
on traditional interpretations of
contemporary songs and original
writing. (Ian Matthews‘ was a
member of the group for a few
years.) They dealt with the present
in the same terms as the past and.-
vice versa.

An enjoyable amalgam was
created; a music of our time, yet out
of time. Thompson's record-
achieves this same effect. Most of
the songs are originals, but they
could have been written in the 16th
century and not have been much
different.

The only non-traditional, non-
original song to be found here is Bob
Dylan’s “Ballad of Easy Rider.” It
is beautifully sung by Sandy Denny.
The songs sung by Linda Thompson
are just as sweetly and resonantly

y =       1    L‘ I 

By PIXIE SOHN

After previously serving two seasonsas assistant
to the recently released Pat Wallace, Jean Balthaser/
will become the new head Pantherette basketball
coach, according to Assistant Athletic. Directorfor
Women’s Athletics Sandy ‘Bullman.

The decision was reached by Pitt’s Athletic
Committee upon the discussion and approval of
Bullman’s choice for the job. After deciding not to
renew PatWallace’s one-year contract, the coaching

a opening had been advertised for three weeks across

Pennsylvania. There were approximately eight

applications, three of which were written resumes. *

The choice of Jean Balthaser came from these
resumes. ’
Balthaser had not originally been released from her
job, but was dismissed as part of Wallace’s staff.
The official reasons given for the release. of Pat
Wallace as head coach were based on the opinion of

1 Bullman that the situation on the team was not
" satisfactory‘.

During the year there had been
numerous, complaints brought to the athletic
department’s attention that the players were unhappy
in Wallace’s handling of the team. There reportedly
was a personality conflict between players and the
coach throughout the season. .

“It was not an easy decision (to release Wallace), “
but it had to be made,” Bullman said. “I’m sorry it

i had to happen, -but Pat didn’t fit into the program.
The kids asked for my help and I couldn’t ‘ignore the
» situation.” ' t

Balthaser becomes the third consecutive assistant
to ascend.to the__position of head coach of the

Pantherettes. For that reason Balthaser wants to ’

enter her job‘ on the softest note possible.

“I will -be the third head coach for some of the
players,” Balthaser said. “A lot will depend upon
how the players and I approach the situation. I will be
looking at theyear as one for building a foundation

I based on mutual respect among the players and
between the ‘players and coaches, plus a level of
conﬁdence in the same groups.”

She also has extensive organizational work to face
before next fall. There is a question as to whether all
of this year’s squad will be returning. As yet, there

6 have been no definite decisions made bythose players
stilluncertain as totheir future in Pitt basketball.

' With this fact in mind, coach Balthaser will be
recruiting to ﬁll speciﬁc" positions on the team. At this
point, recruiting is late getting started and is still in
the looking-over stage with no prospects signed. In
addition, she is facing the hiring of an assistant coach
to her staff. “ , »

“I have a great deal of .self-conﬁdence,or I wouldn’t
step into the job,’ ’ Balthaser said. “I feel mostly that
there is a lot to be done and not enough time to do it.
It’s not going to be easy. I know exactly what I’m
getting into and I’m willing to take the risk.”

Upon being informed of the appointment of Jean
Balthaser to succeed her, Pat Wallace expressed little
surprise to the choice, but questioned what she
believes is the inconsistent manner‘ in which.the
athletic department deals with certain situations.

“After I took over last year we were doing well,”
explained Wallace. “Then we lost a couple of games
and fell to St. Joseph’s by about 10 points. At that

” Balthaser New Pantherette Coach   

time Sandy (Bullman) went to Jean (Balthaser)--not
me—and asked what the problem was and if she was
interested in thehead coaching job.

“Then that May, Sandy asked me to get rid of Jean
as she didn’t ﬁt into the program,” Wallace
continued. ‘,‘I said no because she had just been

1 having adjustment problems coming in the middle of

the year.

‘ ‘Pitt would like to think their program is the best, ’ ’
she added. “But they have to learn to criticize and
take criticism. Sandy has a lot to learn as an
administrator and her position with people. It is not a
question of liking‘ people.”

A majority of the players contacted expressed a
positive attitude in the selection of Balthaser.

“The move will be deﬁnitely good for the team,”
Robin Fry said. ‘ ‘Coach Balthaser talking and getting

to know each of us personally is what we have needed

for a long time.’ ’

MiMi Senkovttski, one player uncertain of her
return, was skeptical of the change. “I don’t know if
it’s going to help,” she said. “All coaches will have
problems ﬁlling criteria and there are always going to
be unhappy people in a competitive situation.” I

“Changing coaches is not good,” Kathy
Pz1<‘zkn\\‘ski reacted. “But if the change is forthe best,
then that’s what they’ re (athletic department) looking
for. You can’t keep someone not doing the job.”

Balthaser, who ‘will officially take her new position
on July 1, feels she has the support of the majority of
the people involved. ‘ ‘I need that or I wouldn’t accept
the job,” she, stated.

By BRUCE GERSON ..

Pitt’s tennis team traveled to the
campus of Carnegie-Mellon Uni-

their independent NCAA season
and presented coach George
Dieffenbach with an impressive 8-1

second-year coach claimed. ‘A‘It was

because it gives‘ our netters

The best efforts of the day were
turned in by Mike I-Iabbel ‘and

each struggled to defeat their
opponents in three sets. A

Dieffenbach added. ‘ ‘It takes _much

Morris College. Dieffenbach
anticipates a good match.

“They are stronger and have
more depth than C-MU,~”the young
coach said. “ We have never played
them before so we might get a
surprise. ’ ’ i /'

For his team’s sake, Dieffenbach
is hoping that, once again, the
weather is his only surprise.

pm: HOME sronrs

Pitt’s baseball team, fresh from a
_p'week-long California road trip,
opens its home season this
afternoon when the Panthers
entertain local rival Duquesne at
Trees Hall Field. This is the
Panthers’ last --home game until
April 17, and game time is 1 p.m.

SAN DIEGO PADRES

Optimism is running high in the
Padre camp as San Diego hopes to
ﬁnish the 1977 season with its best
recortl in the team's seven-year
history.

A third-place showing’ is plaus-
ible as the Padres went the trade
and free agent route this winter to
bolster a weak hitting attack and
obtained two of the American
League's top long-ball threats,
Gene Tenace and George Hen-
drick.

Hendrick will be in center while
Tenace is behind the plate. The
infield will have holdovers Doug
Rader at third and Mike Ivie at
first, while short and second have
been restructured with two rookies.
Bill Almon and Mike Champion.

Along with Hendrick in the
outfield will be speedsters Dave
Winfield and Jerry Turner. Win-
field led the team in homers with 13
but is making some fans impatient
with his yet~to-be-lived”-up-to po-
tential. ‘

Cy Young Award winner Randy
Jones tops manager John Mc-
Namara's starting rotation and
should be a repeater in the
20-game class if he maintains his
health. ‘

The bullpen is first class with
former_ Oakland A's ace Rollie
Fingers (13-11. 2.47) and co-rookie
of the year Butch Metzger (H-4,
2.92).

ATLANTA BRAVES

The Braves have been non-con-
tenders for more seasons than most
fans care to remember and 1976
was a low point as Atlanta finished
last, 32 lengths behind frontrunner
Cincinnati. Since then, controver-
sial owner Ted Turner has opened
his bulging wallet, securing free
agent Gary Matthews in the
re-entry draft.

Matthews, the former Giant, will
find playing conditions in the South
more palatable than those in San
Francisco, where hefty winds
prevented a number of his shots
from leaving Candlestick Park,
lending reason to believe the
outfielder will boost last year’s
totals of 20 homers and 84\RBIs.

Another outﬁelder to benefit
from a change in scenery will be
Jeff Burroughs, a former AL home
run champ, obtained from Texas,
where he encountered atmospheric
conditions not unlike those in
Frisco.

The inﬁeld remains the same
with flashy first baseman Willie
Montanez coming off a fine season
(.317. 11 HRS, 84 RBIs), along with
third baseman Jerry ARoyster,
shortstop Darrel Chaney and
second baseman Rod Gilbreath.
Biff Pocoroba and Vic Correll will
share_ time behind the plate.

Manager Dave Bristol’s pitching
rotation shapes up with Andy
Messersmith (11-11, 3.04), Phil
Niekro (17-11. 3.29) and Dick
Ruthven (14-17. 4.20).

predictions only to fall flat on their

Manager Bill Virdon’s club is
banking on an incredible number of
young arms to channel the Astros
into the winning mainstream.
Included on the staff are Don
Larsen (22 years ‘old), Mark
Lemongello (21), B0 McGlaughlin
(24) and Gene Pentz (24).

Kingpin of the staff is .I.R.
Richard, the 6-8 ﬁreballer who put»
down the opposition 20 times last
year while striking out 214.

A three—way battle for second
base looms in the infield ‘among
Larry Milbourne (.325 in the high

minors), Alex Taveras and Julio

Gonzalez.

No one’s about to unseat the
remaining three infielders. Bob
Watson is one of the best first
baseman in the game, hitting .313
and driving in 102 runs. Third
baseman Enos Cabell hit a
respectable .273, adding 35 stolen
bases, while Roger Metzger hit~a
poor .213 but was the best ﬁelding
shortstop in the league. ‘

Cesar Cedeno is a solid
centerfielder and this fnay be the
year he puts it all together and lives
up to the “next Clemente" tag
pinned on him. Jose Cruz, who
came into his own last year with a
.303 mark, will be in right and
another .300 swinger, recently
acquired Willie Crawford, will
patrol left.

will give new manager Joe
Antobelli plenty of headaches in his
premier season.

i In an effort to patch up a defense
that committed a league-high 186
errors, Antobelli will insert rookie
Johnnie Lemaster at shortstop and
allow Marty Perez, a platooned
player last year, to play full—time at
second. That leaves the corners to
muster some punch. Bill Madlock

_ will be at third after leading thif

league the past two years in hitting;

The pitching staff is young and

improving, but overbalanced with I

righthanders. John “The Count“
Montefusco won 16 a year ago and
with a little luck and defense could
enter the 20-game club. He’ll be
joined by Jim Barr (15 wins), Lynn
McGlothen and Ed Halicki.
