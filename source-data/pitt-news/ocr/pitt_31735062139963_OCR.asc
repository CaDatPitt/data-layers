Editor, The Pitt News:

Vi-"e have been reading about a cit-
izen of ancient Greece, Diogenes, his
name was, who still is considered by
some people as the world's greatest
crank. You will remember him. Mr.-
Editor. from your Greek history as
the gentleman who became so dis-
gusted witlt Greek civilization that he
took up his abode in an old tub, and
gave his life over to nieditation.
You may remember, too, that he went
about the streets of Greece carrying
_a lighted lantern in the day time.

\-Vell, the lighted lantern was sup-
iosg-.d to. mean that he was looking
for an honest man. "Sounds pretty
fanatical, doesn't it. but, Mr. Editor,
we have been thinking about it a
great deal and have come to the con-
clusion that Old Diogenes was no-
body’s fool. Vie believe this gentle-
man and the modern coed have a lot
of things in common. Now, we are
prepared to see you smile broadly at
that statement, but we do not mean
that lllle average Pitt coed has any
inclination to wander about. the cam-
pus with a lighted lantern in the day
time and to poke into dark corners
trying to uncover an honest man. Not
that, Mr. Editor, not at all.

W’ hat we really mean t.o imply is, in
some ways things have changed
since Diogenes’ day, and in some
other ways they are just the same.
Perhaps we have grown a. lot better
\Ve hope so, anyhow, and we do not
need to bother about. the honesty
idea at all. Our problem today, it

- seems, is to find. not an honest man.

but an intelligent. one.

Using the convenient metaphor of
Diogenes’ lantern, sometimes we
see the feeble rays ﬂicker across a
face that promises. If we inveigle

Friday Night At 10; With Prices
Cut, It’s Senior Ball, M’Lads

 

I-Ieloii Mjlliron, a senior in the Col-
lege, is a much photogra.phed miss.
The downtown papers, The Pitt News,
the 1932-33-34 and 35 Owls have been
replete with reproductions of the Mill-
iron physiognomy. On l?‘riday her
picture goes into The News again.

It didn't take too much reportorial
genius to unearth the t'a.ct that Miss
Milliron will be Senior Ball queen
Friday night at Hotel Schenley. Don
Campbell, C, cliairman, who was also
president of the four-dances-per-yea.r
College A.ssoc.ia.t.ion, announced {the
fact yesterday somewliat matter-of-
factly. ‘We pass it on for what it’s
worth as news.

The Ball this year. priced at $2.25
per couple, is the most inexpensive in
modern University history. Past
Senior Balls have run from .353 up to
$5.50. _

"W‘e’1'e trying to do two t.l‘.i11gs,”
said the chairman. “We want to lead
a trend toward less excessive Univer-
sity dance assessments and we also
want to give a Senior Balllpri1naril_v
for seniors. if we can have a goodly
percentage of seniors to attend feeling
it’s really their own. dance——not just
another Unive1'sit_v affair merely with
seniors on the committee—~we’ll be
satisﬁed.” .

Russ Lyon and his NBC broadcast-
ing band will play from 10 to 2 o’clock.
Tickets are available with meinbe-rs
oi‘ the coinmittec and in Room 801,
Cathedral,

As a. parting shot, C‘a.mp‘oell. denied
that the Ball had really been sched-
uled for the Y but, as reported at
Spring l*‘os1:ival time.

'l‘hree seniors—Jolm Terrence, Leon-

were honored. by Pi Sigma. Alpha, hon-
orary political. science fraternity, Mon-
day evening.

The group planned to honor the
outstanding student in political sci-
ence this year.
cide who was the one, the faculty com-
milztee, lieaded by Dr. Elmer Graper,
head of the department, found that
three contestants were equally worthy.

Accordingly, Dr. Rosalind Branning
gave the three men an equal sum of
money with which they are to buy
three books dealing with any ﬁeld of
political science.

The other members of the faculty
committee which determined the re-
cipieuts included ‘Dr, Benjamin Wil-
liams, associate professor of political
science, Dr. James -Charlesworth, as-
sistant professor of political science,
and Dr. Roger V, Shumate, instructor
in political science,

The fraternity also elected ofl?ice1's
for the coming year. A nominating

Good Idea,-.But-It W on’t. Work, Says
Math, Professor Of Chain Letters

 

By Herbert Rackoff

“There is nothing mathematically
wrong with the ‘chain-letter’ idea,”
says Dr. VV. 1. Miller, assistant pro-
fessor of mathematics, “but it just
won’t work.” ' ’ "

The plan of sending one dime and
five letters looks feasible enough on
paper, but Dr. Miller needed only
elementary algebra to prove that if
everyone receiving such a. letter would
obey its command, it would take about
two months to send one to every per-
son iu the United States, assuming
that every person receives one,,and
only one letter.

After that dup-lications would begin
to occur, and soon the point would be
reached where the number of letters
requiring dimes would far outnum-
ber those containing them.

“Therefore,” Dr. Miller pointed out,

,“‘the chain letter offers two alter-

natives: either one must’ break the
chain and receive no money at all, or
he must carry out its idea and lose
out in the end anyway. As soon as
someone breaks the chain, the returns

begin to diminish enormously, and the
chances of receiving dimes are ex-
tremely meager at best.”

The chances for fraud in a scheme
of this kind have led to its being de-
rclared illegal,’ stated Dr. Miller, I-Ie
poi-nted out that it would be extreme-
ly easy to mail ﬁve letters and forget
about the dime entirely. Also, the
element of coercion which many of
these letters contain makes them un-
desirable. And «ﬁnally, an unscrupu-
lous person could easily mail a thous-
and or so letters with his name on the
top of the list, and reap an amazing
amount from his rule violations.

"Just iniagiiie,” concluded Dr. Miller,
“what sort of thing would happen if
this fantastic idea were carried to ex-
tremes. In no time at all the supply
of dimes would run so low that even
the eftm-t.<.= or". our most ardent inﬂation-
ists could not. keep-__ enough of them
in circulation.‘ And‘ if ‘you substitute‘
dollars for dimes, the idea brings us
to the brink of another world-wide de-
pression. N0, the chain-letter idea is
merely a great pipe-dream.”

Fascisin and cmniniiiiisni are realities that we of
this generation must face. Not only do they exist
in the world and hence affect us iiulircctly, but
lulioy affect us d_irectl,v as ever-present tlireats. To
deny any 1)OSSll)llll_\’ of their ever takiiig; hold in
tliis country is eiimnr sheer bliiicliiess or wishful
lllllllilllg‘. Tlicy arc, and will be, vital issues in our
lives.

VVitli this in mind, the lice-pl for widespread
l<nowledgc of tlicsc s;vsl.cn1s of government is self-
cvident. If either of them is desirable, that fact
should be learned: if they are undesirable and
dangerous, we must know how to combat. them. In
no case can igiior-am-e enable us to face them. The
army that ﬁghts blind is lost. i

It is essential that courses be i11stit'utc(l at Yale
to deal speciﬁcally with these problems . . . Need-
less to say, the study of our own government and
of more nearly related systems must be in no way
sacriﬁced. Indeed, it can be made the more signi-
ﬁcant in the light of contrast . . . No man is equip-
ped for life in his civilization without a thorough
knowledge of those forces which are impinging on
it, and which threaten to destroy it.——-The Yale
Daily News.

 

WE‘ARE by no means advocating that Cornell
- undergraduates suddenly raise the red banner
and blow up the White. House. \\"e are suggesting
that*when:the"'lca(lrrl'g>political and‘ economic prob-
lem of our day is whether capitalism can and
«ought to come through the present crisis unchang-
ed, and when an authoritative writer in the cur-
rent issue of The American Scholar says that if the
conversion of the intellectuals to the radical cause
continues at the present rate there won ’t. be a lit-
erary defender of laissez-fajre capitalism left in
the United, States in another ten years—-Cornell
undergraduates should at least. be discussing the
problem. '

IT MATTERS little whctlier one turns oncis at-
tention to the youthful attitude toward patriot-
ism, democracy, tlieology, marriage, or fraternity.
Everywhere one ﬁnds a decided lack of enliliusiasm
and a lack of blind conﬁdence in past beliefs.
\Vhen someone suggests that unless the Demo-
cratic party is successful in maneuvering the coun-
try out of the depression, ‘there will be an inevit-
able rush toward l:‘ascisn1 or communism, only a
few youthful voices are raised to express 1'cgret.
that the democracy which has been so vital a part.
of our socictj should go by the boards. \Vhen ef-
foi-ts are made to attract young people to the
churches, the result is imsatisfactory because there
is solittle feeling involved that sleep seems more
inviting than the prospect of having someone at-
tempt to save souls. This sullen attitude can be
disco:-iied in other realms of thought.

"What is important. is that this astonishing skep-
ticism is a reality among young people, and that
unless some star is available for them to attach to
there will be a lackadaisical and unpleasant dip
toward anarchy and the dissolution of our society.
\/Vaving ﬂags is of no avail, and it is to be doubted
if Jonathan Edwards himself could kindle the re-
ligious ashes left from the spiritual ﬁres of years
gone by. .

It is not a cheerful picture. The need which
exists is for new ideas, new convictions, and some
tangible and constructive planks on which young
people can stride toward a more attractive and ex-
citing‘ Utopia’ than is pictured by the politicians
and moralists of the present day.——The Cornell

Money Grabbing Ideals Of Contemporary Society
Will Load World To Imminent Collapse-Maurcr

By Herrymon Maurer

T HAS been for some iirne the aim of this column to
pi'ese1it. a. series of articles. of which this is the last. to
Dféisent the cultural doc-a_v of our present civilization.
“Cultural decay" is. perhaps. a phrase wliich suggests
theoretical analysis. The job of coming to grips with-

out civilization. however, is not for the scholar alone.

The decay of our civilization. though never was it
wholly healthy, is not 3. process far removed from us.
It is touching us at every moment; it enters into our
lives. our thoughts, our relations with other persons.
It ma)’ cramp our feelings. turn us into ﬂimsy c:xric:1-
tures of human iiciiigs. inoiiey seekers. It may break us
with a life of moiiotony, or it may starve us and destroy
us.

It niay limit our interest. and (‘O‘;lSP(]'=.lRllt:_\‘ our emo-
tions, to the naz'ro'.v range of one class of people who
strive for nothing ‘out material si.1cces;<: it may deprive

it offers us no ineaning (lei:-per‘ than tliat to be found in
the pursuit of weal-‘gh. ’l"‘-here m-a_v be those who would
not shrink from the pilll1‘_\'l1eSS and stiﬁness of :1 purely
traditional existence. “'9 leave tliose persons to them-
selves. Most of us. in;-xvever, are too aware of long
breadliues. of monotonous day-in and day-out ercistence,
too conscious that despair caused by insecurit_v and the

all the time we I1-ave been students. The stench of 
decay has already ol1‘endcd our nostrils.

To those who are unwilling to move into the clutcliing
grasp of a. greedy civilization a genuine way of life is
possible. Not that it is an exciting life; not that such
a life demands visits to strange lands, tumults, and
hitclied battles. It is a life which looks about it and
draws sustenance from l.‘uings close home. It. involves
an interest in the problems S‘1l1‘.I'()1lll(ll1l_.‘.',‘ it; it cannot
thrive without an ui.1«lei‘s’ta:1(ling of those problems alid

broblems which our society has vrorlicrl out.

/i Kimono Sclifoqity,
Ur Wuclz. Poetry I
In The Dark

 

By Edwin Banks
Soliloquy in a Kimono

Here in my room, a little place,
Grouchy, with gloom grim upon my face,
Here in the yellow light,

With my bookshelf,

The scattered papers on my desk,

The clatter of the Corona,

The drowsy patter of the rain

Pouring night too soon again,

Splatter on the window pane,
Nothingness roaring in my brain,

Here I sit, a pretty mess,

In my kimono, ..
I, myself. ‘ ., A
From nothingness suddenly‘ has flared you, dear.
Do you hear? I called ybu dear. '

You were clear once, you know.

It really was just a short while ago, too.

lWhy the rain should splash you, I can’t imagine.
It used to be somewhat painful,

Having the radio sob you up

Out of a plaintive song.

But it really wasn't so long ago after all,

You must recall,

You and Star Dust,

And a tawdry, maudlin dance hall.

Well I remember, it was not in bleak December,

And your memory is not to me a dying ember.

It would be nice, I suppose,

If I could write words like. those,

Music, word music, -

A poet breathing ice and fire into melody.

Dear, I confess, _
Though it wouldn’t have made you feel so good, I guess,
That your beauty never was to’ me like anything
But—you.

Your voice was pleasant, low,

When you were kidding me.

I never fancied it a nightingaIe’s throbbing note,
But maybe I never heard a Keats bird anyhow.

I never wrote down your hair as anything

But crisp, clean stuff that smelled okay.

Your eyes—~the only time I like your eyes

Was in the half dark.

What color were they then?

They never mirrored any stars,

Not even Mars nor Venus, nor the moon.

They were merely moist and glistening,

And I remember that I hoped that you were happy.
I got over hoping soon, of course.

The truth is, clear,

I took you for all.

I never tore you apart into bits

And found you like alcharming thousand little trinkets
That clutter up a poet’s mind.

But who said I was a poet, in the first place?

Behind my words you read, “I,”

Don’t you?

Well, let me say this, and I am through:

I liked your warm. dry kiss.

You could be pretty.

You were neat in a blue dress.“

And you could be upsettingly sweet.

I guess, too, I liked those things you said a lot
After I should have forgotten them

As the hackneyed line

You reeled off to at least nine other fools,
Tools of your vain, thoughtless pleasure,
Though that is sour grapes.

And I treasure them still, I will admit,
Else why should I be writing this,

My unmelodious, unpoetic poem?

There were a white flash through the black leaves
Of the cherry tree at my window

And a grumble of thunder.

I wonder if it isn't about time

To go to bed

And let the rain"

VVe need ratlier to observe, to think out our
ideas for ourselves. Creation of a new society depends
upon the attitudes of vast numbers of persons. For this
reason its speciﬁc‘.-i.tions cannot be neatly drawn up.
No one can say, “We will have this or this or tins.”

but embody the iileas and the feelings of the people who,
living in the old and rat.-ognizing its decay, have come to

stitution as sacred in itself. It becomes iinpe1‘ative to

Lloyd Proposes SFA Azfopt

Luncheon-Dance Program

y Alan C. Lloyd

I-IE JUNIOR women started a. new idea on Friday.

one which could be developed and put to good ad-
vantage. “Since most everybody that stays for school
on Friday afternoon pays a quarter or more for lunch,”
they reasoned, “Why not make the price  cents and
have an orchestra. and dancing?”-

There being no reason why not, they proceeded with
plans and held the affair for the junior men. Tables
were set up about the dancing ﬂoor of Heinz House, giv-
ing that staid place the appearance of a cabaret. Un-
fortunately for the plans, the event had not been well
advertised, so that the attendance was less than ex-
pected. To remedy this. Bob Bowdler and Fran Mc-
Laughlin hopped down to the rotacee drill and marched
a. regiment or so back up. Then the party proceeded
merrily. Everyone agreed it was a ﬁne idea.

People are somewhat tired o‘fVtea iian'ces'.' The hours
are bad, people get hungI_‘y,. faces are drab and clothes
are soiled, you know. SFA might easily take over" the
Iuncheon dance idea and make a ﬁne thing of it once a.
month. A hundred people could easily clear expenses.

to turn to history for knowledge of causes and results,
and to apply that knowledge to our own experience.
\Ve need to keep our own horizons broad enough to on-
close different classes, different peoples, ditferent na-
tionalities.

Above all. it is important to feel and feel deeply about
the horrors of our own civilization. about its emptiness;
it is important to understand that ideas are not at stake.
It is human beings who are suffering, not abstractions;
it is real persons who are forced to undergo emptiness
and Ineaiiixiglessiiess and znonotony.

It is not the aim of this column to preach any pur-
iicular social philosophy, or to signify any particular
way of realizing a new society asthc only effective one.
It is rather to suggest ways of approach to it questioning
ct‘ our r.resent—day world. To that end I should like to
close this series with a comment on the Conceptions
which are embodied in the frescoes of the .=‘.lexi(-an
painter. .roz<-o. Orozco has never preached a true way
of salvation of our economic and social ills. He is it
silggestive ratliur than a didactic artist. lle prefers to
look at the present order, understand it. present it in
its lllSi.0l'l(‘ill position, aiul to paint with a deep symp-.ithy
the persons who live. in it.

Above all, he feels what he paints. V\'itl1 Orozco there
has been no neat accept:-.u1ce of cn_v doctrine. "He has
l'll()1‘.gll.‘L out for hiinscli’ liis own r€»:act.ions to the prob-
lems before him, and in 9.21011 line of his painted forms.
in each splash of color there stands the evidence of his
own €'I‘l10tlOI1i.ll struggle to understand and to criticize.
T110 treinendous conviction he has put into his ex-
pression reaches out and grasps the obse1‘ve1', forces him
to understand the ixziportance ol‘ the problem, and the
necessity for :1 reaction to it.

Look for a moment at his panel “Modern Nationalism"
at l)a.rtmouth college. Even a. photograpli, however
unable is a. black-and—wI1ite reproduction to represent
the brilliant effective color, suggests the power of the
painting. A soldier, stretched out on the ground, buried
under piles of oppressive wreaths, weighed down by a

Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel assistant to the dean of
the College, wrote his d'o'c't.or’s thesis in 1931 on “An at-
tempt to predict the success of University freshnien in
their adjustment to S('ll()l8.Sl.‘l(: work."

In it, he explains that, among other "things, there is
deﬁnitely a. correlation betwcell the grade you make on
your general entrance exams and your success in col-
lege. So brains do count.

Moreover, physique is no really effective excuse for
failure, for there is little difference in the average
achievement of persons scored in the three health rat-
ings at Pitt. Your A health rating doesn't make you any
more likely, then, to succeed, than somebody else's C.

Your high school rating is important, though, because
this study of Dr. He-ld’s points out that there is a. differ-
ence in achievement among the people of different ﬁfths
of their class."

for the 1935-1936 term will be install-
ed. This is the second annual Kitchen
Kabinet luncheon to be sD0I1$01'9d by
the class of 1937. _

Last year at the conclusion of the
luncheon, each member of the fresh-
man cabinet dressed in call ‘ﬁnd
kitchen apron recited a, rhyme telling
of the duties of her office and ending
by calling forward the woman who
was to be» her successor.

By doffing her apron to the new
cabinet member she invested the new
woman with a symbol of office.

This year the officers will be in-
stalled in a similar way although the
program chairmen, Nancy Metcall
and Fernande Mercier, refuse to say
just what the ceremony will be like.
The tables will be covered in kitchen
style red-checked cloths. The decorat-
ing is the work. of Dorothy Langguth
and May Emery. _

Elinor Scott, publicity and invita-
tions chairman, sent red panel‘ kitchen

Auleene M. Jamison, director of the
Student Health service for Wornen;
and Miss Pauline 'l‘hat<,-her, seci'et.a}')’-
nurse of the Student Health service
for women.

Tickets, priced at 2:3 cents, have
been on sale for a week. Frances Cal-
houn. is the director for ticket sales.
Favors have been chosen by Irene
Matveak. Mary Louise Dowling is
the chairman of the affair.

The outgoing cabinet is composed
of Elinor Scott, president; Barbara
Hargreave, vice president; Lulu
Sekey, secretary; Rita. ‘Cm-'t?3’, t1‘€iiS—
urer; and the following committee
chairmen: ﬁnance, Ruth Shapiro; ac-
tivities, Alberta Boyer; publicity,
liziary Frances Myers; social, Lois Fol-
lansbee; sports, Jeanne Mac Masters;
interclass sing, Ellenjane I)owney;
and program, Katliryn Hardy. ’l.‘l'1e
"WSG-A representative is Mary Louise

The members of the cabinet to be
installed today include: Katliryii
Hardy, president; Rita (‘.are_v, vice

Heinz House and will probably be in

classes of 1936 and 1938.

Maid Mails Missive

(Continued from Page One)
Perhaps we have outgrown the hon-
esty idea. since poor old Diogenes
was so disturbed over it, and perhaps
we have grown so‘ used to honesty
that it is no longer. attractive, or yet
again it may be that we have lived
with the sins of,’ man so long we
have ceased" to’ object to them. We
can’t decide about that.

What. we do know is that it does
not concern us so much whether our
men are honest as whether they have
two hiteresting ideas to rub together.

Cainpus  Issues Booklet

On Avocations For Graduates

After college what?

The campus YVVCA will attempt to
supply an answer to University coeds
in a booklet to be distriluited to
graduating senior women at the Coro-
nation breakfast June 4.

In answer 110 the cliarge, that col-
lege does not prepare students for
.community life, the YVV has planned
to present to each gr-adiiating woman
a booklet containing lists of civic or-
ganizations with which tbe new gradu-
ate niight care to ally herself.

The book will supply concrete in-
formation for the college woman who
is interested in political questions, in
community social problems. or in
problems of an international nature
It will list organizations open to the
young woinan who has a pa.i'ticulz.r
bent for uil;erna-ional peace, for
church and 1':-llgsous organizations, or
for the new Igeacher ;Irterested in pro-
gressive education.

The booklet will tell former Pitt.
Players satellites how inembersliip in
several community crgzanizations will
permit them to r-.on.‘..'nue tl1eir'inter-
est, and it will indicate the club
aﬁiliation for persons interested in
music, or in an organizatioii similar
to Inquiry forum.

Although not speciﬁcally stated as
such, the booklet should prove of
value to graduates who do not imme-
diately ﬁnd employxnent as a means
of directing their activities and mak-
ing helpful contacts.

Information to be included in the
booklet will be the purpose of the or-

granization and the important pliascs
of its program, membership require-
ments and dues. a. list of oﬁicers and
location of headc;ua.rters, and addi-
tional information about the founding
and history of the organization.

The publishing of the booklet has
been planned by the Campus Life
committee of the Y\\''. Intimate home
contacts between students and fac-
ulty have been made possible through-
out the year through the cfforts of
this conimit.t.ee_ Helen Bruun, Ed3.3,
is chairman of the project.

Organizations who have been asked

WAA Members
To Fete Seniors

 

Awards For Athletic .:Pa.rticipa.tion
To Be Made At Banquet

Senior members of VVAA will be
feted May 27 at the Y but when the
annual intramural banquet of VVAA is
held. This affair combines a farewell
to the seniors with the presenlzation
of awards for four years of athletic

Senior women are eligible for this
award after three hours of practice

for the award system. Blue and gold
keystones, upon which the letters
“WAA” are printed in the center
above three bars, are the prizes for
the four years devoted to WAA activi-
ties. «

The program of the evening will
consist of speeches by the new and re-
tiring presidents of WAA, the awards,
and possibly guest speakers.

Tickets for the banquet

cents. Senior women have been in-
vited by cards, which they have been
asked to answer as soon as possible.

Committee chairmen, under Leah
Stark, C36, general chairman, are:
Mary Lou Dowling, Ed37, favors; Vir-
ginia Boyd, Ed37, food; Dolores Hoff-
man, Ed38, invitations and tickets.
