° PPC trip

By Jim Tezak

The Pitt Program Council's

 Spring Break trip to Daytona

Beach went well this year, ac-
cording to the PPC’s assistant
director of Student Activities,
Tom Misuraca, despite com-
plaints about the accommo-
dations.

The complaints about the trip
centered mainly on the Claren-
don Plaza, the hotel where the
students stayed. Problems ranged
from normaid service to rude

_ qrlesk attendants to bad service in

general.

’’I think that they could work a
little harder on treating students
more as people not just as
Spring Break students, because
Pitt students don't cause
problems. We’ve had a five—year
good reputation, and they should

' treat us accordingly,” said Denise

Orwig, the chairwoman of the
PPC Recreation Committee.
Gil Borok, a Pitt student who

went on the trip, said that he bas-~ '

ically had a good time and that
the trip was well organized.
Borok, however, was dissatisfied
with the hotel.

”The major complaint I had,
and the one most other people
had, was just the attitude of the
hotel [employees] in general.
They weren't treating us as nor-
mal registered guests. The maid

Shuttle Discovery launchessatellite  

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— Discovery's astronauts, safely
in orbit Monday after a weather-
delayed launch, set free a $100
million satellite to complete a
globe-spanning network that will
let future spacefarers call Mission
Control at almost any time.

The 2‘/2-ton Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite, its double parasol-
like antennae folded, slipped
clear of Discovery's cargo bay at
4:10 p.m. EST and floated into
space.

”We had a good deploy, on
time,” said Discovery mission
specialist Robert C. Springer.

At a critical moment in the
deployment, an unexplained
electronic signal momentarily
jammed a computer used to
deploy the satellite, but then, just
as mysteriously, the machine
cleared up and appeared normal.

”We didn't get any [more] of
those spurious signals,” Springer
said.

Mission Control confirmed that
data on the ground showed that

the computer was functioning
normally.

An hour after the deployment,
TDRS’s powerful first-stage rock-
et fired and sent the craft toward
a new, higher orbit.

Kathy Sullivan, an astronaut

acting as Mission Control com-
municator with Discovery, told
the crew the rocket firing was so
accurate that a ”trim burn,” used
to correct errors, was not re-
quired.

Cut-rate pay offered
to Eastern strikers

MIAMI (AP) — Eastern Airlines
imposed a cut-rate pay package
on Machinists workers Monday
that gives them far less than the
wages that prompted a 9—day-old
strike, and makes the airline the
lowest paying of all major
carriers.

”I think it's obvious they don't
want anybody to come back to
work,” Wally Haber, a general

NEWS BRIEFS

chairman for the Machinists un-

ion, said of the new pay scale,

which applies to union workers‘
who cross picket lines as well as

new hires.

But Eastern continued to dis-
play its resolve to fly, renewing
more routes as part of a gradual
rebuilding that centers on Latin
American service and cheap
Northeast shuttle flights.

Some Wall Street analysts said
Eastern appears likely to expand
its off-price fare strategy, which _
was so successful last weekend
that hundreds of people were
stranded in airports when they
couldn't get aboard packed
Eastern shuttle flights.

tions began a four-day confer-
ence Monday with ISO items on
the agenda but attention fixed on
The Satanic Verses and Iran’s ord-
er that its author be killed.

The Saudi foreign minister op-
posed Iran’s insistence that dis-
cussion of the novel and author
Salman Rushdie head the agen-
da. Referring to Iranian response
to the book, he cautioned against
”this rabid invasion aimed at un-
dermining the Islamic faith and
personality.”

By Monday, no mention of
Rushd_ie had been made in con-
ference coverage by the
government-guided Saudi media.

Saudi Arabia and other Islamic
countries have criticized Rushdie
and banned his novel, which
Moslems say blasphemes Islam,
but have not supported Iranian
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
K'homeini’s instruction to his fol-
lowers to kill the writer. '

THEE PITT, NEWS, Tuesday, March 14, I989

-Spring Break '89

Student finds mirth, madness, morality in paradise

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Eight days and lo hours later, I
stepped off my bus back into Pitt ter-
ritory. I had survived spring break at

.. Daytona Beach.

But I didn't feel too well. Lack of
sleep and an I8-hour bus trip had
made my body hate me. By Friday,
I was craving alcohol at noon, and
I wondered about the possibilities of
detox.

I cannot deny that it was a dream
assignment. My trip was paid for,
and my food would be covered by
The Pitt News. All I had to do was
cover spring break as a participant,
something I did my best to do.

Now I couldn't help feeIing'Iike I

6. needed a vacation.

EIEID

I can't really complain about the
‘bus trip down to Florida. There is
really no way to make it fully enjoy-
able, but the Pitt Program Council
did its best. Our buses were all I 988
or '89 models, as opposed to the

.~ relics from the early I970s used on

-' other trips, and were equipped with
VCRS. They were also the widest
buses available.

However, there is no way to
avoid discomfort on a such a long
ride. Being able to drink on the bus
was a comforting factor, and was
the only way that I could fall asleep.
Some people didn't seem tovneed
sleep, though. Pika brother Jay Reid
was able to drink for the full I8

Otours, an accomplishment that even

outshined his victory in the surfing
contest.

We got to see Bruce Willis’ Die
Hard and A Nightmare on Elm
Street, thanks to the VCR, and the
radio was playing much of the trip.
Unfortunately, we were not able to
pick up a decent station until we
were past Jacksonville, Fla.

While at a rest stop in Georgia,
I had the pleasure of eating in a

.diner filled with more toothless red-

necks thanl had ever seen in my life.

The food was good, but I couldn't _

help wondering if all the people in
the place were related. I had never
seen De/iverance, but it seemed like
a logical choice for the next movie.
Ironically, the sun did not come
out until we were I5 minutes from
Daytona. I didn't realize that this
was a sign of things to come.
We arrived in Daytona around I
p.m., iust in time to catch some of
the contests on the back deck of the
hotel. Miraculously, my roommate

was able to check in before most of
the guests swarmed on the check-
in table, and I was able to reach
poolside just in time for the bikini
contest. As I drank my first beer in
Daytona, I couldn't help but wonder
about the things to come.

EIDD

Jud ing the state of Florida by the
FDaytona Beach is like judg-
ing the city of Pittsburgh by Schen-
Iey Park. Prior to my vacation,
visions of modern-day Sodom and
Gomorrah often come to my mind
when someone mentioned Florida.
I didn't know how wrong I was.
On Saturday night, I traveled
north to Jacksonville to visit my older
brother. While we were driving
through town, I commented about
a sign outside a church that said,
"Life with Jesus is an endless hope.
Life without Jesus is a hopeless
end." I wouldn't have said any-
thing, but it was about the hundredth
religious—oriented sign I had seen in

 

Jacksonville.

My brother, who has lived in Flori-
da for only two years, told me that
he was amazed by the influence
fundamentalist Christians had on the
City.

"That was one of the first things
I noticed when I moved here," he
told me, rolling his eyes. "The
church people are always on the
news, and they seem to be able to
affect the local and state
governments."

He told me that topless bars had
recently became illegal after the
Jacksonville government succumbed

to pressure from the church. I don't.

mean to generalize, but I had al-
ways heard that military men, sepa-
rated from their loved ones, would

go to those clubs. The fact that there‘

are three naval bases in the Jack-
sonville area shows the influence of
the church.

"It was worse when I lived in the
trailer park," my brother continued.
"They [the fundamentalists] came to
my door on a weekly basis. I've

never seen anything like it."

Yeah, but this is Jacksonville, I
thought to myself. Nothing like that
happens in Daytona Beach. Little
did I know.

It is difficult to attribute this to the
religious influence, but when I
returned to Daytona, I found a more
conservative attitude than I expect-
ed. The bars and liquor stores were
stricter about underage drinking, but
I had heard they were going to
crack down on the spring breakers.
My true surprise came when I saw
the "wet T-shirt" contest.

Everyone who has ever seen a
spring break movie knows that many
of the girls in the movies take off their
shirts during the competition. The
people who went to Daytona last
year told me that this actually hap-
pens, too. However, it doesn't hap-
pen anymore.

According to an employee of Pen-
rod's bar, a girl was arrested for
indecent exposure after she bared
her breasts during the contest. Now,
with the police standing nearby, the

Penrod's people tell the girls not to
take off their shirts.

My brother's words about the in-
fluence of fundamentalists came
back to me.

[.7 F3 I3

After three days of beautiful
weather, the gods must have feared
we were homesick, because we
were blessed with Pittsburgh
weather from Tuesday on. I couldn't

believe I was facing 40 degree

weather.

Before that, the beach had been
a blast. I didn't realize how out of
shape I was until my roommate
bought a football. The contests on
the back deck were entertaining,
and I was able to see Brett Hubinger
make Pitt proud by taking first in the
belly flop contest. _

The bad weather caused the can-
cellation of the afternoon contests,

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March I4, I98‘?

Continued from page 3

winner in sophomore Jennifer Leech,
who took first place in the wet T-shirt
contest at the Rock Palace on Tues-
day night.

"Our money was stolen," she
told me, seeming slightly embar-
rassed at talking to the press. ’’I did
it sober, out of pure necessity. I
wouldn't have done it if we hadn't
lost our money."

Leech's victory brought her SI 00.
The next night, her roommate San-
dy Plute tied for first in the contest,
and won half of the prize.

Considering the prices in Dayto-
no, the money probably lasted them
a day and a half.

BUD

On Tuesday night, I sadly accept-
ed my "underage" stamp as I en-
tered Penrod's. The stamp would
get me into any of the three bars
owned by our hotel, including Pen-
rod’s, Plantations and the Rock
Palace, but I wouldn't be able to
drink in the bars.

My luck had run out about a half
hour earlier, when a bouncer at the

70l , a club up the street, destroyed

I i my fake l.D. before my eyes. I was

surprised, since the same guy had
taken the l.D. two nights earlier.

I guess |shouIdn’t complain, since
I wasn't arrested, but I was hoping
to officially retire that I.D., my faith-
ful friend for two years, when I turn
2l at the end of May. The guy at
70l wouldn't let me in for the under-
age price, so we went to Penrod's,
where I accepted my scarlet letter.

Of course, critics will say that I
should be satisfied since I was still
able to get into the bars. However,
the thought of paying a SIO cover
charge, and not being able to drink,
made me sick. It cost people of le-
gal age, or those with better luck
han I had, $8 to enter, but at least
there were drink specials. That price
was merely expensive, as opposed
to outrageous.

The worst part, though, was be-
ing in the clubs sober, a torture no
one short of a Nazi war criminal
should be made to bear. With the
flashing lights and the dance music
pounding away (I used to like Tone
Luc's "Wild Thing" until I heard it
every two minutes in Daytona), I
needed a drink to enjoy myself.

From then on, I made sure I had
a few drinks before I entered the
clubs. Sure, you could have some-
one with the over—2l stamp buy you
a drink, but that was risky. There
were bar employees walking

around with flashlights checking

take a genius to figure out that she
was probably hit on a number of
times a night by drunken tourists
looking for a trophy.

l identified myself as a reporter,
and she agreed to answer my ques-
tions. Seeming relieved to talk to
someone interested in what she had
to say, she told me her name was
Dee Wright and that she was a stu-
dent at a local college. She also told
me that she hated her job.

''I only took this job because l
heard l would make great money in
tips," she said. "l've been working
here a week, and you don't make
that much money’working here."

She added that Daytona residents
rarely go to these bars. She recom-
mended a place called The Ocean
Deck as a place to hang out.

"There's a reggae band there ev-
ery night, and the drinks aren't ex-
pensive, like in this place. And
nobody wears anything like this,"
she said, snapping her spandex
pants.

The spring breakers weren't the
only large group of vacationers in
Daytona. lt was also "Biker
Week," and the streets were
swarming with bikers from all over
the country.

l was considerably nervous as l

enterea the Rat's l-lole, a store that
sells biker paraphernalia. I had just
ead Hunter Thompson's He//s An-
gels not three weeks before, which
the author wrote after following the
motorcycle outlaws for several
months. The last chapter details the
beating Thompson got from the An-
gels when he refused to give them
the profits from the book.

That three—page chapter ran

through my mind repeatedly as I
walked through the store. l found l
had nothing to worry about when l
met Karl "Big Daddy Rat" Smith,
owner of the the Rat's Hole.
"l'm glad you're talking to us,"
Smith said, laughing. "Everyone
thinks that we're the bad guys, but
the locals prefer the bikers over the
spring breakers."

Wearing a black satin iacket co-
vered with motorcycle patches,
Smith, with his thinning hair greased
back and a gray goatee, began to
explain the differences between the
bikers and the students.

"The bikers come down here with
$2,000," he said. "The students
come down with $200, and when
they run out, they have to call Dad-
dy for more. There's no doubt in the
restaurants who the better tippers
are."

Smith also told me that the bikers
"never jump off of balconies, like a
few spring breakers do every year."

jumped from a hotel balcony that
week. The balconies in my hotel
were locked for that very reason.

Smith said that a local newscaster
organized a group called Destina-
tion Daytona to show the city offi-
cials that the locals wanted the
bikers. Smith served on the board,
along with lawyers, local business-
men and American Red Cross
officials.

"There are always a few bad ap-
ples, but on the whole you'll find
we're very easy to get along with,"
Smith said. "The spring breakers
who meet the bikers usually like
them. l just got a beautiful letter from
a college girl who said we were the
nicest people she met in Daytono."

l later found out that many of the
girls l knew got rides from the bik-
ers. Only one girl said she had any
trouble with bikers, who could eas-
ily be some of Big Daddy Rat's
"bad apples."

Last year, the bikers raised
$57,000 for Easter Seals during Bik-
er \/Veek, and l had to admit that
Smith was right when he said that
the spring breakers didn't make that
kind of contribution. If there was any
part of my vacation where l learned
the most, it was my half hour in the
Rat's Hole.

All in all, it was a positive ex-
perience, though I could have used
more sun. As l got off. ‘me ass and
saw the snow on the Cathedral
lawn, I appreciated the few good
days we had in Davtona.

Sure, Daytono was a tourist trap.
lt was exhausting, expensive, and
l will go over the edge if l ever hear
Paula Abdul's "Straight Up" again.

Homeless revisited

Recent studies have shed some new light on the
homeless situation. Many of the myths, propagated
by both proponents and antagonists of the homeless
cause, have given way to something more closely ap-
proximating fact.

There are fewer homeless people than some promi-
nent politicians (Michael Dukakis, for one) have stat-
ed. Instead of numbering in the millions, an Urban
Institute study indicates that there were probably no
more than 600,000 people homeless in the United
States in 1987.

The theory that _the homeless are in their position
due to laziness is also inaccurate. The opposing view-
point, that they are just "regular" people, is no less
true.

The homeless are people with serious problems,

‘ like alcoholism, drug abuse and crime.

U.S. News and World Report reported in its most
recent issue that current studies conducted by the
Department of Housing and Urban Developrnent and
the Urban Institute (a bipartisan organization), indi-
cate that 33 percent to 38 percent of the homeless
are alcoholics. Habitual drug users make up 13 per-

cent to 25 percent of the homeless. Twenty—one per-

cent to 24 percent are people either convicted of a

felony or who have done time in a state or federal

prison. I

The number of mentally ill homeless people is
much lower than suggested by Ronald Reagan. The
studies showed that less than 5 percent of the home-
less are mentallyill.

The effects of charity programs designed to help 1

these people were seen to be negligible, since near-
ly 80,000 people work as volunteers in homeless
shelters alone. This is too simplistic an approach to
the problem.

These studies are a first step. They have provided v/
a closer look- at some of the causes of homelessness.

With this information we are armed to wage a war
against the problems that afflict these people. Drug
and alcohol abuse centers, designed not only to get
addicts off the streets but off drugs as well, parallel
programs designed to help ex-convicts integrate into
society and find jobs. These are the types of correc-
tive action that the homeless problem requires. Feed-
ing the people of the streets, however noble, is
treating a symptom. Now, the disease must be cured.

Church leadership

Last week saw theend of a meeting in the Vatican
between American bishops in the Catholic Church
and the pope. Pope John Paul II feels there is a need
to pull the bishops into a more uniform doctrinal line,
so that they will be fervently teaching the dogma of
Rome, rather than simply managing the church.

This is fine. There is a need for uniformity in teach-
ing ina unified church. But the dissent in America,
not to mention the Dutch and Brazilian churches"
(both summoned to Rome for a slap on the wrist, in
relation to the controversial liberation theology popu-
lar in both churches), indicates that perhaps the papal
authority is not reacting flexibly enough to the chang-
ing times. To unify a church under one leader, the
leader must be able to respond to all of the needs

of his or her flock. If there isdissent, then important

‘needs are not being met’ ; . .   .

Unless you've spent the past
six months trapped in a mine
shaft, you've probably noticed
that "Quayle-railing” has be-
come a favorite pastime for many
Americans. What is Quayle-
railing? It's a type of recreation
taken up by people who buy the
Sunday paper for the comic sec-
tion instead of the news. Its num-
bers are comprised of impudent
Americans who hastily hail Mik-
hail Gorbachev, but are hesitant
to give one of our own leaders
the benefit of the doubt.

Dan Quayle has become a
common topic of conversation.
Amidst a modern-day discussion
of governmental politics, one
might hear the phrase, "Quayle
scares me." However, if you real-
ly crave to insult the intelligence
of one of these self-proclaimed
political analysts, then pose this
stumping question in reply:
"Why?" The chances are good
that in reply you'll get a pre-
election wisecrack that has been
beaten to the ground repeatedly.
Indeed, he'll have no hard evi-

dence to support his statement. .

Many jokes have centered
around Quayle's "inexperience.”
However, more amusing than the
jokes is the fact that these quips
lack substance and validity.

President Bush was criticized
for his choice of Dan Quayle as
a vice president. The media per-
sistently (and quite successfully)
drove into the heads of the pub-
lic that this pick was geared to at-
tract the younger white-collar
types and the female crowd to the
Bush-Quayle ticket. This claim
was not only ill-thought, but
ridiculous. If President Bush was
aiming to draw more votes, then
he would've chosen the very
popular Robert Dole, or even
Jack Kemp.

It was also suggested that Bush
picked Quayle to toughen his
standing in_the Midwest. This is
quite possible. However, ifthis is
what Bush was aiming for, then
would it not have been more ad-
vantageous for him to pick Mr.
Dole? Remember, Dole blew
Bush away in the Iowa caucuses.

The truth is that Bush picked a
very eager and qualified running
mate.

So, why did he pick Quayle,
and what were Quayle's qualifi-
cations? To answer those ques-

tions, we must first examine \/.v‘h’at‘_j ,   ,

problems of the next few years.
Bush's platform recognized the
attention that must be given to
the budget deficit, defense, edu-
cation, the environment,
Medicaid and public health, and
Social Security, among others.
How could he find a running
mate who would cover all these
bases? Amazingly, he found one:
Indiana Senator Dan Quayle.
By the age of 41, Dan Quayle
had already served terms in both
the House of Representatives and
as an Indiana senator. Further-
more, by 1988 he had served on
three congressional committees
for the Senate. I -
One of these was the Senate

SDI and was a driving force in
many military procurement re-
forms during the Reagan years.
He also criticized former Secre-
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberg-
er for some of his proposed major
increases in defer se spending.

Quayle also statied the Labor
and Human Resources Commit-
tee, which was established in
1978 to review legisla‘ion con-
cerning labor, health, purlic wel-
fare, Social Security affa.'s and
education.

The vice president also served
on the Senate Budget Committee,
which was created to legislae
government programs and budg-
et proposals. Mr. Quayle had
previously unitedlwith other
Republicans in pressuring the
Reagan administration to focus
onthe deficit. The budget deficit
is a matter that has been placed

‘Indianapolis-bound  
Hoyas win, but Panthers make NCAA cut

to

 

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

NEVV YORK — ”/t was the kind
of game that you see on the corn-
er of 42nd and Broadway at 2
a.m." .

— James Caan (reprised) from
the movie Chapter Two.

Let's just say that Pitt was
mugged.

After defeating Villanova 71-66
Friday night, the Panthers had to
come back Saturday afternoon
and play No.1 seeded George-
town in this past weekend's Big
East Tournament.

The game was close for the first
eight minutes. The Panthers
made it tough for the Hoyas, and
the game was tied at 18 with a lit-
tle over 12 minutes left. Then
there was a TV timeout. As it
turned out, that was the end of
Pitt’s chances.

Georgetown proceeded to go
on an 18-point run and Pitt was
never in the game again, losing
85-62.

_ ”The pace of the game was a
little too tough for us to handle,”
Pitt Coach Paul Evans said. ”Play-
ing an emotional game Friday
night and having to play Geor-.
getown the very next day was a
little bit much. We couldn't play
at that pace for 40 minutes."

The loss didn't hurt the Pan-
thers all that much. By beating
the Wildcats in the first round,
they knew that they were virtual-
ly locked as an NCAA Tourna-
ment team. They found out
Sunday that they were the No.8
seed in the Midwest Region,
generally regarded as the tough-
est draw.

The loss gave the weary Pan— '

thers an extra day to get ready for
the NCAAs where they will face
the No.9 seed Ball State Cardinals
(28-2) Thursday night in Indi-
anapolis, Ind.

”Any team with a record like
that has to be a good team,” Pitt's
Darelle Porter said. ”We just
have to execute and get the job
done/’

Porter excelled in the Big East
tourney, scoring 19 points and
dishing out 16 assists. Against
Georgetown, Porter had just
about the most exciting play of
the game and possibly the whole
tournament.

With 17 minutes left in the
game, Pitt was down 48-34 and
the game was well in hand. Port-
er took a shot from the top of the

key. It banked off the back and a E

group of players were jumping
for the ball. Pitt's Brian Shorter
tipped it up, but the ball didn't go
in.

Georgetown center Alonzo
Mourning tried to get it, but it
slipped out of his hands. Porter
stood back, watching this hap-
pen. He made his way down the
side of the lane and jumped side-
ways, over two people, to slam
it home.

”Nobody was there to block
me out, so I just ran down and
put it in,” Porter said. ’’It came
out perfect.”

”It was just something where
he had his timing right and it just
happened,” said Shorter, the Big
East Rookie of the Year.

Now the Panthers have to con-
centrate on the Ca_rdinals - a
team from the same conference
(Metro-Atlantic) as last season's
NCAA first-round opponent

York state

NEW YORK — Out of the
19,591 seats in the supposed-
ly sold-out Madison Square
Garden, I was probably the

only fan dumb enough to buy
a ticket from a scalper for the
wrong section — the George-
town student section.

WILLIAM
YOUNG

Itlall started out innocently
enough. While signing in for
press credentials, I discovered,
somewhat to my chagrin, that
only our sports editor,_ Vince
Carey, was on the list. I was
told to buy my own tickets. I
called the Garden and was
told that tickets for all the
games were sold. ”Great,” I
thought, ”$2OO in expense
money, and |_’ve got to buy
scalped tickets.” The only
thing going through my mind
was, ”Do they give receipts?”

Four hours and 94 city
blocks later, I returned to the

One ’fan’s’ New

‘ school. Since Pitt had a one-

of mind

per. Just before the opening
tip-off, I managed to find a
kind-hearted fellow willing to
part with a ticket for $25. At
only a buck more than the list
price, I thought I was getting
a bargain.

With _17:35 left in the first
half, an usher directed me to
my seat, smack-dab in the
middle of a sea of gray.
Shocked was I as I proceeded
to take my seat at my first live
basketball game since high

point lead (and since they had
beaten the Hoyas once earlier
in the season), I figured that I
would be a proud, although
not necessarily loud, fan.

The first thing I noticed was
that the game seems to go a lot
faster when it's seen live, as
opposed to on the tube. The
plays are much more impres-
sive as well, as real-life slam-
dunks are more awe-inspiring
than the run-of-the-mill TV
dunks (at least to a 5-foot-11
shrimp like me).

NEW YORK — ‘This past

weekend's Big East Tournament ~

had its ups and downs.

The Georgetown Hoyas ran
ripshod through each of their
games. They defeated Boston
College 82-52, Pitt 85-62 and
Syracuse 88-79. '

The team so thoroughly domi-
nated the field that the Hoyas
never had a game in doubt.

”I think that this is probably the

_ best Georgetown team that I have

ever seen,” Pitt Coach Paul Evans
said. ”Balance-wise and
numbers-wise, I think this is the
best team they have ever put on
the floor.

”They have guys like Anthony
Allen, who was Mr. Texas Basket-
ball, and Milton Bell, who would
have been our best player com-
ing in as a freshman if we could‘
have signed him, sitting the
bench and playing 45 seconds a
game. That's what I call depth.”

took a 27-16 lead that seemed to
place them in a favorable posi-

Q»

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, March 14, 1989

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

0 Pitt. LSU. Memphis State.
DePaul. Providence. What do
these teams have in common?

Strength of schedule.

By virtue of the teams they
played and the upsets they
pulled, these and other teams
made the NCAA Tournament cut,
while other teams — teams with
better records — will watch the
games on television.

The NCAA made it clear this

, season that patsy schedules and

padded win—loss records would
not mean much come tourna-
ment time. And for nearly every
team, that has held true.

Take Clemson, for example.
The Tigers finished the season at
18-10, finishing sixth in the ACC
behind North Carolina, Duke,
N.C. State, Georgia Tech and Vir-
ginia, all of which made the tour-

nament.

Clemson has wins over three of

those teams, including victories
over G.T. and Duke in the final
week of the regular season.

THIS DEAD

Impressive victories, a strong
finish, a strong schedule and a
respected league put the Tigers
IIW.
’ The Pitt Panthers also went the
\x'.T\' of the tough schedule,
defeating Oklahoma, George-
t<)\\n, Seton Hall, Florida and
S\ racuse — all but Florida were
top 10 programs at the time.

If the bids were doled out strict-
ly on the basis of wins, Pitt's
17-12 record would by no means
be enough. Losses to Duquesne
and Boston College also tar-
nished Pitt’s chances. -

But on the basis of its perfor-
mance against some of the most
outstanding teams in the nation
— the Panthers played 10
tourney-invite teams, including
Arizona, Siena, Robert Morris,
Providence and West Virginia,
going 8-7 against them — Pitt
earned its third consecutive bid.

The NCAA also stepped away
from Convention by moving high-
seeded teams away from their
home courts.

Indiana, which is seeded se-
cond in the West after winning

the Big Ten regular season title,

will play at Tuscon instead of the
Customary Indianapolis
homestand.

North Carolina finds itself in At-
lanta rather than the DeanDome,
and Syracuse plays at Dallas in-
stead of the Carrier Dome.

0 Remember when Siena’s
Steve McCoy laid the ball in the
hoop after a steal from Pitt's
Darelle Porter to give Siena an

NCAA
ROUNDUP

80-79 upset victory over the Pan-

thers in November? McCoy did

it again.

In the ECAC North Atlantic
Conference title game, Siena
trailed by one point with seconds
remaining when a Siena player
threw up a prayer that ended up
being nothing more than an
airball.

But the 6-foot—7 McCoy
grabbed the loose ball, put it up
again and scored the game-
winner.

Of course, Siena’s fans couldn't
go wild as their team earned an
automatic bid to the tourney. An
outbreak of measles earlier in the
season left Siena playing in
quarantined gymnasiums.

The quarantine has been lifted
for the tournament, and besides
filling the stands, Siena filled
another void — the lack of a
nickname.

‘I3

Siena played all season without

one, but recently adopted the

Saints as their moniker.

0 Barring a major upset, North
Carolina and Michigan, the No.2
and 3 seeds in the Southeast,
respectively, will play each other
for the third consecutive year in
the tournament.

The Wolverines open against
Xavier and will then face the win-

thers handled IO8—9O in Lincoln,
Neb.

’’I really don’t know much
about Ball State,” Shorter said.
”We just have to play them like
any other team. We can't look
past them at all.” _

If the Panthers get by Ball State,
their next opponent would prob-
ably be lllinois, the No.1 seed in
the region.

’’I have always dreamed about
playing in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, so I’m looking forward to
it,” Shorter said. ”This is my big
chance, so I'm going to try to take
advantage of it.”

Porter feels that Pitt has a
chance to go as far as anybody
can.

”Every team can be beaten,”
Porter said. ”I think we are going
to do well. We are capable of
beating anybody.”

Shorter feels the same way.

”Everybody is pretty confi-
dent,” Shorter said. ”\/Ve feel that
since we have come this far, we
can go even more. Everybody’s
looking forward to it and feels
good about our chances.”

Continued from page 11

Perhaps one of the biggest
problems I had sitting in the
Georgetown section, besides not
knowing any Georgetown cheers
(”We’re the Hoyas” — no duh)
was not knowing who any of
their players were until after the
first 10 minutes had passed. The
girls sitting to my left were cons-
tantly asking me who the guy
with the goatee was; fortunately,
the announcer said his name ev-
ery other minute so I was able to
say ”Charles Smith” with con-
fidence.

One of the most depressing
things about Saturday, besides
watching the Panthers lose by 23_
points, was watching the Pitt fans
lose interest. Most of them held
on as Pitt went scoreless for
almost six minutes while the
Hoyas put up 18 straight points.

The Panthers looked like they
were going to turn things around

when Darelle Porter went for a *

slam early in the second half, but
it was pretty much downhill for
Pitt from there. While George
town was busy mounting a
29-point lead, Pitt fans were busy
mounting the stairs, except for the
few diehards chanting for Scott
Colombo. _

As they say in New York, ”Go
figure.”

Tourney favorites ask each other,
”Who are these other teams?

By Dave Goldberg

AP Sports Writer

Except for Lon Kruger and,

Clem Haskins, almost every
coach playing a mystery team in
a first-round game in the NCAA
basketball can sing the same
refrain: ”Who are these guys?”

It was stated most bluntly by
Coach Ralph Miller of 21-7 Ore-
gon State, for whom every game
could be his last. Miller, whose
Beavers are the sixth seed in the
West regional, turned 70 last

’ Thursday and is retiring after this

season.

”We absolutely know nothing
about Evansville,” he said after
finding out that his first-round op-
ponent in Tucson Friday will be
the 24-5 Purple Aces, champion
of the Midwestern Collegiate
Conference.

”But we'll know something
soon.”

"The top seeds face the same
problems, but should breeze
through their games. Since the
current 64—team format was es-
tablished in 1985, the highest
seeds to lose in the first round
were Indiana to Cleveland State
and Notre Dame to Arkansas-
Little Rock in 1986. Indiana and
Notre Dame were third seeds in
their regions, the victors were
14th.

 

This year's top four —— George-
town in the East, Illinois in the
Midwest, Oklahoma in the
Southeast and Arizona in the
West — begin play as prohibitive
favorites.

Georgetown, whose dominant
play in the Big East tournament
has made it the early favorite to
win the overall title, meets Ivy
League champion Princeton Fri-
day in Providence in a matchup
that might have been more intrig-
uing a year ago when Hoya
Coach John Thompson's son
played for the Tigers.

Illinois will play in Indianapo-
lis Thursday against McNeese
State, whose 16-13 record is the
worst of any team in the tourna-
ment; Oklahoma will play East
Tennessee State Friday in Nash-
ville; and No.1—ranked Arizona
will be in Boise, Idaho Thursday
against Robert Morris, whose
fans, ironically, displayed signs
proclaiming ”Bring On Arizona”
as their team won the Northeast

Conference tournament last
week.
Like most other first-round

games, those are all matchups of
strangers.

The one exception is the meet-
ing in Greensboro, N.C., Thurs-
day between Kruger’s Kansas
State team and Haskins’ Min-
nesota team.

 

They played in Minneapolis in
January with the Gophers win-
ning 72-67 in a game Kansas
State played without center Fred

McKoy, who had the flu. The»

19-10 Wildcats are seeded sixth
in the East; 17-11 Minnesota,
which got most of its big winslat
home, is seeded 11th.

Some of the more intriguing
first-round matchups pit big
names against no—names —
schools unheard of outside their
immediate area.

One involves 18th—ranked Ball
State, whose 28-2 record is the
best in the tournament, against
Pitt, whose 17-12 mark is second
worst, in Indianapolis on
Thursday.

Yet Pitt is seeded higher, eighth
in the Midwest to ninth for Ball
State, primarily on the basis of its
”good” wins — it has beaten two
top seeds, Georgetown and Ok-
lahoma, No.7 Syracuse and 11th-
ranked Seton Hall twice, but lost
to such teams as Duquesne, Sie-
na and Boston College.

Siena, champion of the ECAC
North Atlantic, is involved in a
similar game, against 13th-ranked
Stanford, the Pac-10 runnerup.’

In fact, if anyone is a mystery
team, it's the newly christened
Saints — like Stanford more than
a decade ago, they dropped the

of a measles outbreak at the
Loudonville, N.Y., school that left
its players quarantined.

Moreover, Siena is playing in
Greensboro, N.C., within the
eastern region, and they've seen
Stanford on television, something
the Cardinal, third—seeded in the
East, can't say about them.

”They’re not the kind of club
that's going to completely over-
whelm us with their athleticism,”

' says Siena Coach Mike Deane,

whose team finished 24-4. ”Stan-
ford, more than any Pac-10 team
in particular, mirrors our style a
little. We're both skill clubs.”
