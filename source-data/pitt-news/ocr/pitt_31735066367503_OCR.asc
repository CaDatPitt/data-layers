Saga Discloses
Food Service
Policy Changes

Lunch time meals at a ten per-
cent discount with no gratitudes
added are now available to stu-
dents in the Venetion Room, ac-
cording to Charles Douglass, di-
rector of Saga Food Service.

From 11:30 to 1:30 p.m. stu-
dents will be allotted the discount
upon showing their invoices at the
checkout desk. '

Tomorrow ‘night in the SU Ball-
room, Supper Room and Cafeteria,
a buffet dinner will be served to
students from 5 to 6:30 p.m. in-
stead‘ of the regular cafeteria
meal from 4:30 to 7 p.m.

Approximately 50 University
guests have been invited includ-
ing the chancellor and members
of the housing committee. This
is the second meal of its kind,
the first having taken place at

Christmas.

The hospitality of Saga will be
expanded also in the Hunt Room.
Students using these facilities will
have free punch and popcorn pro-
vided.

Although the Hunt Room has
made many additions to their
menu during the past few months,
none of these have reflected the
University spirit as much as the
new Cathedral Sundae, similar to
a banana split.

Cafeteria Stormed
In Defiance Of
Dress Regulations

By TOl\/I ‘BRYANT

Much to the amusement of
hundreds of dorm students,
35 co-eds “stormed” the cafe-
teria last Thursday evening
in deﬁance of the. so-called
“dressing code.” ’

The exodus to the cafeteria fol-
lowed a scheduled mass demon-
stration of women students, attir-
ed in slacks, in the Schenley
Quadrangle. However, because of

,. a lack of student support, a large-

scale demonstration failed to ma-
terialize.

The controversy centered on
the questionable “dressing code’,
published last week in The Pitt
News. Acording to the, article,
women would not be permitted to
Wear slacks or bermuda shorts in
the cafeteria except on Saturdays.

Denounce Code

Student-sponsored petitions, de-

nouncing the “code”, were cir-

culated throughout the dorms

Merwin

To Appear at Midday

By PAT CHERKIN
W. S. Merwin, young American poet, will appear at the
Midday series this Wednesday in the Student Union Ball-
room. Merwin is well known for his translations as well as

his poetry, which he is said to

“read beautifully.”

After receiving his A.B. in English from Princeton Uni-
versity, he did graduate work in Romance Languages. Mer-

win held a “Kenyon Review” fel-‘v

lowship in 1954, received a Rocke-

feller grant’ for playwriting in]

1956, and the Institute of Arts and
Letters Award, in 1957.

Merwin spent two years tutor-
ing in Spain, France and Portugal.

C During this time he tutored the

children of the Princess de Bra-
ganza in Portugal, and William
Graves, son of Robert Graves, in
Mallorca.

The poet's ‘publications in-

president of student’govern—

Hunter has dropped out of
the addition of
Sobota"s name as a presidential
candidate keeps the number at
“three” running for the top posi-
tion.

A pre-law student majoring in
political science, Sabota said, “It
is my opinion that, although our
Student Government has striven,
‘in the past, to imitate the system
of government by which our Na’-
tional Government operates, we
have literally ‘missed the boat’ by
failing to adopt one of the major
methods by which the U. S. gov-
ernment functions efﬁciently and

Pat Teeters To
Campaign For
Vice-President

Pat Teeters, Bus. Ad. jr., an-
nounced today that she will be
running for SG vice—president in
the upcoming election. Her name
will be entered independently.

Miss Teeters lists her activities.

as Secretary of SG, treasurer of
Delta Delta Delta sorority.

She feels, “My experience as
Secretary of the Senate during
the past year has made me aware
of the needs and weaknesses of
Student Government. Although I
choose to run independently, my
ideals coincide with the platforms
of both political parties.”

Chuck Isler, present president
of SG, supports her candidacy.
“From past experience I person-
ally feel that Pat Teeters is the
most qualiﬁed and motivated of
all “the candidates to date.”

Plans of SC Political Parties

Still Growing, Election Nears

Candidates Dissolve

ACP, IDEA Merger

lThe merger between the IDEA
and ACP—parties, which was an-
nounced last Wed., has been dis-
solved, according to leaders of the
two groups.

“Our principles are still in
agreement with those of the ACP,”
said Ray Reaves, head of the
IDEA Party. “However, due to
the inability of the two groups to
agree on the selection of candi-
dates, we have chosen to dissolve
the merger.”

Bob Hunter and Ray Reaves,
candidates from the former IDEA
Party, are not planning at pres-
ent to run for either the presi-
dential or vice-presidential ofﬁces.

Concerning the effects of the
move on his party, Rosenzweig
said, “The Ideals of ACP Party
are essentially the same asthey
were at its inception, and will re-
main unaltered.

“We have never been inter-
ested in personal opportunism,
but rather have been dedicated
to the assemblage of the best
possible personnel to carry out
a successful reconstruction of
the Student Government system.

“We feel that the students of the
University will judge the parties
and candidates in this election
strictly on merit, and will not con-
sider the oﬁices as popularity
prizes, but rather as positions to
be ﬁlled by capable, responsible
persons.

“We of the ACP have had
strength of conviction to this point
and will continue to, if elected, in
seeking to promote the best inter-
ests of the University, especially
of its st;ud,en,ts.”

Debates Provocate '
Fulton Challenge

Bob Fulton, SPA candidate for
the student government "presi-
dency, has challenged the other
presidential candidates to meet
with him in the elections debate
on Feb. 16 at noon in the SU
Ballroom. S

dential, candidate said he believes

vague in most areas to be taken
seriously.”

He pointed out that if the col--
legiates want a leadership lab
for freshmen and sophomores it

, must mean that they do not con-
sider these students capable of
assuming responsibilities until
their junior or senior years.
Voight challenged the ACP to
speciﬁcally mention which activi-
ties they mean to evaluate as well
as the purpose of such an evalu-
ation.
Bob Fulton endorsed Voight in
‘behalf of the entire SPA con-
stituency. He cited Voight’s ex-

man of the Major Events Com-
mittee in the present student gov-
ernment.

He also cited his activities in
Sweden where he was sent as
one of three delegates from the
entire United States to the In-
ternational Conference on Juvenile
Delinquency, as indicative of his
leadership abilities.

Fulton said that “with the re-
organization and energetic action

will put into effect in student
government, a dynamic organizer

, Serving for one year as a
senator. Sabota explained that
he would also strive for more
efficiency in the internal or-
ganization of the Senate.

“Certainly before the Senate
can coordinate the student body
and the administration,” he said,
“it must be’ able to function ef-
fectively. I feel that there is a
need for more effective means of
holding senators
their positions.

“This can be accomplished in
my opinion, through more specific
provisions for the removal of
those senators who fail to fulfill
the obligations which they assume
when selected.”

No Free Rides

A member of the 1961 Greek
Vveek publicity committee, the
Owl stall and the Delta Sigma
Phi social fraternity, Sabota in
conculsion said, “Being entirely

‘independent of any party, I am

not expecting to ride into ofﬁce

contributing a ‘free ride’ into of-

“I advise students to BE-

for it is here that the problems
of irresponsibility have their
roots. Students who ‘take the
easy Way out’ and vote strictly
of the party. are, ineffect, mak-
ing it ‘an easy way in’ for those
people whose only interest in
SG is to ‘add another item to
their list of activities.’

“If elected, I will attempt to
appoint to various executive com-
mittees only responsible people,
with no commitments to any
groups or individuals. I am not
running on a “You elect me and
I will appoint you’ type of propo-
sition. My desire is a SG which is
homogeneous in purpose, yet he-
terogeneous with respect to ideas
and interests.”

Story from Life

 

When does a man make the most important
decision of his business career? When G. M.
Oldham graduated from college in 1927 he
could not have foreseen that his joining a
Pennsylvania public utility would be that
"most important decision.” No crystal ball
could have told him that his decision then
would lead to his present position as super-
intendent of the world’s ﬁrst full-scale atomic
power station devoted exclusively to civilian
needs. But he did know that joining the
progressive electric industry in Pennsylvania
. could mean a bright and rewarding career.

  iflectian Suggestions

A most important committee concerned with student

‘elections is the one that often falls into the background.

This group, the election committee, is responsible for es-T

‘ tablishing rules, regulations and codes which the political
parties and individuals must abide by-

One rule that is missing from the format of this com-

"mittee concernsthe manner in which the president and

vice-president» are elected. Since the trend in politicsis to
lean toward forming’ parties, it is rather unusual that ‘when

I" one has-a. party system, the president and vice-president

a‘re=»not voted upon asa .unit. ‘

 By not having the vote cast as a unit, the platform of

. the party is deemphasized and the personality of the in-

dividual becomes the ‘vote catcher. V b
By setting up a party system with no means of assuring

I the two leading candidates in that particular party the op-

portunity to carry out their platform together, the perfect

battleﬁeld for back stabbing and petty politics is set up——=

the end result being a personality contest.
Regardless of howridiculous the situation seems to be

right now, a day of voting for student government leaders ~

willstill take place. We hope that students, in spite of all
the fog, will select the best students for these positions.

The election’s committee will play an important role
on February 22 when they supervise the voting procedures
at .the pen. 2 '

We would like to suggest that the polls be handled in
a manner similar to the mock presidential election con-
ducted by Dr. Edward Cooke, associate professor of political
science. I e A ' C

This would mean that at every polling place at least
one representative of each party‘ would be present. In ad-
dition, student leaders, who are not associated with the
political race, would help to supervise the voting.

Each student would have his invoice stamped when

.,voting in order to eliminate duplicate voting and also to
‘serve as identiﬁcation. v

Ilfvwhat we suggest sounds as if we are being overly
cautious, we feel that this is necessary since both the stakes
and the competition are high. '

By setting. up strict regulations and by placing the bal-

lot box in closer proximity to those supervising, ballot

stuffing, which seemed to have been the prevalent practice
for victory in recent years, will be reduced. ~ -

' government indirectly subsidises

From the “Pork -Barrel" . . . "
By Dam Johnson

’Help the economy; don’t let those poor Ameri-
cans starve; we must keepour labor force at work;
unemployment is rising; we need aid to areas of
cronic unemployment; all are reasons given for
depressediarea legislation. Can this kind of aid be
called anything but “pork barrel” aid?

The principle argument for this aid is it helps
regions that have a surplus labor-
force, i.e. unemployment, to hold 5
their populations by encourag-A

ing businesses and factories to 5
move -to these localities. The

any industry or business that
moves into one of the ‘govern-
ment “sponsored” regions, be-
cause the main use of the gov-
ernment-provided money is to
buy, build, or promote conditions 

most ’favorable to the employer.

Not only does this indirect subsidy allow the
companies to operate at a lower cost, but in addi-
tion gives the depressed areas a monetary advan-
tage over normal sections of the country.

What justiﬁcation can anyone offer for this
favoritism to particular, when the government has
a responsibility‘ to the nation as a whole. This type
of ‘help is against, our national senseof fair play
and equal opportunities for all.

Money Problems

What if the money is not forthcoming? Does
this not make any chance of ’a decrease in unem-
ployment and an increase in our total national
product utterly impossible? The answer is a cate-

r gorical no! _
If there is no depressed area aid, eventually

the surplus or unemployed working force will nat-
urally migrate. to other areas, a.reas where more

workers are needed, and where work is available. a

endeavor. Regions, like people, cannot be favored
‘if we are to maintain the dynamic ideas of our
heritage.

Law of Supply and Demand '

For the whole nation, best results can be obtain.
ed by following the law of supply and demand. For
a while certain sections and groups will suffer, but
the country will be allowed to develope without
undue interference from any domain. The govern-
ment will have been saved also the deﬁciency that
would have occurred because of this type of Con-
gressional legislature.

Progress sometimes outdates certain industries
or regions. For example, when the coal industry
was young, Pennsylvania’s Fayette County was a
thriving, teeming area of virtually no unemploy-
ment. Coal was king, and Fayette had coal. But
with the higher cost of mining and the better
methods of manufacturing coke, Fayette became a
“depressed area”. ‘V

What was done‘? Had the area made any attempt
to build a second industry? No, Fayette was only
a “one horse” area devoted exclusively to coal.
Even at this people were particularly unwilling to
movg to other more productive areasior to help.
themselves. _ -

Now Fayette County wants the federal govern-

ment and the whole nation to give them money. -

Money for what? What can they reasonably do to
bring enough industry into the area to support the
outlandish number of people there now.

‘Fayette County, along with ‘other areas, has
only one thing needed by industry—people. People
are more movable than industry. If something
must be done, why not move the people.

If the government must give money away, the
money should be used to pay the moving bill for
the unemployed- Let ,progress take its natural
course. Our nation’s future as a growingfree so-
ciety dependsupon it. A A A A

Clothing Regulations,

By Julie Thomas
‘Whether any person has the right to tell any

-oth'er~person how to dress or act on a,University

campus presents itself as one of the major prob-
lems now being discussed at this University. When
a group of, students, the so called student leaders

. (the president of A.W.S., the
president of Student Govern-

ment, the president of Student
Union‘ Board, the president of
the“ Junior Class Council, the
secretary of Student Govern- "
ment, and ‘representatives from
Student Senate) passed a series
of resolutions in the form of a
clothing code, it hit the campus
with a thud. A .

These students, who were
elected as representatives of

the student body and invested by that body with-

the power to take action in’ the interest of students
as a whole, are now accused of violating individual
liberties and freedoms by those very students they
represent, because they have made use of the
power given to them. .
Problem Discussed 4 T ~

What most students fail /to realize or to admit
is that, campus dress has been submitted to these
representatives as a deﬁnite problem deserving
correction——submitted not only by members of the
faculty and administration but by the students
themselves as well.

 

\

Almost every major group on campus has dis-
cussed this problem at some time or other over the
past year. And now when the so calledv“do-noth-
ing” student governing bodies do attempt to pre-
sent a solution to a problem, they are labelled ty-
rants and aggressive dictators. ’ _ ,

Cries of resident students resound through the
cathedral halls that the University is “my” home
and the Student Union “my” living room and _“my”
dining room. Therefore, “my” right to dress as I

‘ please should not and cannot be invaded.

Reality Reigns

In principle these students are right. But reality
is so much more to the point. Anyone will agree
thatthe University home differs, of' necessity, from

« the family home. It must follow that to dress “com-.
\ fortably” in each of these homes means two differ-

ent things. .

How can anyone feel justiﬁed and within, his
rights to offend a member of either family" by his
dress? Now itis obvious that what may be termed
offensive in one ‘home (family or university) is
not necessarily oﬁensive in another. But at any
rate, standards of some sort have been set in each
of these homes. = » '

The University’s problem is to coordinate the
standards of a multitude of homes and consolidate
them into ‘a workable homey atmosphere. A sys-
tem of give and take must be practiced by all
parties concerned. At last, and at least, something
‘has been done. ’

Student Questions
New Clothing Code

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Wednesday, Feb. 8 issue of
The Pitt News carried a front
page article on a new “clothing
code” adopted by several stu-
dent r -organizations. Naturally,
any manifestations of interest
«in the appearance of students is
a good "sign, but a movement
under the formidable name of
“a clothing code’! is hardly the
answer to a spruce—up job for
the Pitt student body.

A movement for the improve-

 

ment of dress among the stu-
dents must come as a ground-
swell among the students them-

selves, for what this code calls

for is a show of good taste, and
the fact is that good taste can-
not be enacted, legislated, or or-

dained. Good taste must be an ’

individual effort applied by the
individual to improve his own
appearance. v '

In the final analysis, this good
taste cannot be determined by
anyone but the individual. Wh/at
looks to be in good taste on one
person may be close to disgrace-
ful on the next, and the task
of discerning the fine line which

separates the two cannot be done
by a four or five paragraph
statement.

In addition, while this code
attempts to specify what will be
considered in “good taste” in
certain areas and at certain times
i.e_., “school clothes” —- collared
shirts tucked in, dress or khaki
pants for menpsweaters, blouses,
skirts, or dresses for women --
in the Student Union from 7 a.m.
to .7 p.m., one may question
whetherithe old tee-shirts will
be in better taste while adorn-
ing the Student,Union at 8 p.m.

in effect) than they would be at
5 pm, (when they are forbid-

den.) -
The point of allthis is that

\while suggestions from student

organizations on what might be
done to improve the appearance
of our student body are always
welcome as worthwhile, one
questions that a rigidly enforc-
ed “code of dress” will heighten
the students’ interest in’ th e
need, not for improved dress per
se, but for an increased aware-
ness of th e necessity of in-
dividual good taste as it applies
to our urban environment.
Would it not be better to ap-

.'proach the situation with the

idea of accepting these sugges-
tions with a show of good judg-
men t, leaving problems, of
breach of good taste to be dealt
with“ individually as they arise.

.This rather than decreeing what

shall be correct and incorrect,
when and .where, and perhaps
envoking a feeling of encroach-
ment upon personal expression,
valid or invalid as that feeling
may be.

Discretion in Dress

Asked, Not Rules

Editor, The Pitt News:

On Wednesday, February 8,

1961, you published an article
concerning a code of proper dress
in the classes and  the campus
of the University. When we came
to college we were given certain
responsibilities by both our1pa-
rents and this school, one of
these was using our own discre-
tion in clothing. .

By discretion we mean using a
mature attitude concerning our

dress while on our campus so I.

as to reflect the true conditions
of students here. ’
We feel that all students have
a right to chose their attire not
only because it is a personal
right insured in a democracy but
also because we feel that the
students attending this univer-
sity are mature enough to ful-
fill - to the satisfaction of all
- the responsibilities entrusted

- to them.

 

Are we here to put up a
“front” for all people who visit
here, or ‘are we paying for an
education.

It seems to us that the Asso-
ciated Women, Student Union
Board, Mcn‘s Council, and Stu-
dent Senate have busily search-
ed for an issue and found a

ridiculous one in order to prove
to the students and others asso-
ciated with the University that
they are trying to overcome the
stagnant period that they have
been in for the past semester
and a half.
Keep trying!

Co-ed Wonders If ,
‘Code’ Really Works

Editor, The Pitt News:

Once again several impotent
committees of the University have
banded together to formulate a
so-called “clothing code.” These
vague committees maintain that
the purpose of this “code” is to
favorably impress the public.

The University is supposedly
an educational institution of the
highest rank. It is a very poor
university that must rely upon
the dress of its students to im-
press the world favorably. Let
us hope that the University of
Pittsburgh has much more than
this to offer.

Obviously, the designed ‘ pur-
pose of this code is to restrict
the student to the fullest ex-
tent. After all, what is more
personal than the clothes a per-
son chooses to wear‘?

The main problem lies in the
fact that the University is grow-
ing, especially so far as the num-
ber of resident students is con-
cerned. With such expansion new
problems and ideas are bound to
arisen

The ruling aristocracy of the
University appears to be at a
loss as to how to handle most
situations which may arise.
Therefore, they rush aheadpand
devise rules, regulations and re-
strictions. Thus if the student
attempts to be an individual and
dares to do anything quite so
base as wearing Bermuda shorts
into the cafeteria, he immedi-

ately falls into a neat slot for

which the powers have form-L

ulated a rule and they are cap-
able of handling the situation.

However, before the commit-
tees issucd such a code, did they
at any time bother to ask the
student if he had any preference
as to the type of clothing he
would like to wear’?

We must realize that any in-
stitution has rules to which the
members must adhere. But there

examining the committees. The
sooner the University realizes
that the student is not a dumb
clod. the sooner Pitt will be one
step closer to being an “Alma
Mater, wise and glorious."

If these
concerned about preserving the
reputation of the University, why
don‘t they frisk the Oakland
hoodlums or guard the paintings
in the Student Union? 01‘ if this
does not meet the tastes of the

committees are so

Dr. Willard Hale Sigafoos, head of the department of anthro-
pology at Southern Reserve University, and int:-crnatvionally
known as an authority on primitive peoples, returned _vesterda._v
from a. four—yea.r scientiﬁc expedition to the lieadwaters of the
Amazon River. Among the many int-eicsting mementos of his

EASTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY
The annual meeting of the American Philological Institute,
held last week at Eastern Reserve University, was enlivened
by. the reading of two divergent monographs concerning the
origins of early Gothic “runes,” as letters of primitive alphabets
are called. *

Dr. Tristram Lathrop Spleen, famed far and wide as the dis-
coverer of the High German Consonant Shift, read a paper in
which he traced the origins of the Old Wendish rune “pt/5
(pronounced “krahtz”) to the middle Lettic rune “gr” (pro-
nounced “albert”). On the other hand, Dr. Richard Cummer-
bund Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows, translated
“The Pajama Game” into Middle High Bactrian, contended
in his paper that the Old Wcndish rune “pt” derives from the
Low Erse rune “mf” (pronounced “gr").

Well, sir the discussion grew so heated tlmt Dr. Twonkcy
ﬁnally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gym-
nasium and put onthe gloves. ‘Dr. Splccn accepted the chal-

SCHENLEY PARK LOOKED like a winter wonderland last VVed-i
‘nesday when six inches of snow covered everything in the Oak.
land area. Two students tread through the snow to a morning class,
not yet aware that their afternoon classes would be cancelled. Yet

no one could forget what had happened the Friday before when six .
inches of snow fell, and all the commuters spent several hours on
streetcars and buses that creeped in and out of the city. VVhen Uni-
 versity otﬁcials saw Oakland being buried again under the white
blanket, all classes were immediately dismissed.

  

 

  

N0 CLASSES! THE SNOW went to the heads of many students in
more way than one. Students engaged in battles with adversaries -
everywhere. The group of boys (left) stormed students coming from
the Student Union with one snowball after another~—-the war was
on. VVhile the boys chose the rougher sport, the girls (above) pre-
ferred to build snowmen, and a rather big one at that. Plain, not
fancy, seemed to be the style this year for snowmen. Scattered on
the white lawns around the cathedral and in front of the Student
Union, none of the white men had eyes, noses or mouths like the
ones that most of us made when we were young‘.

Although the Oakland area
looked picturesque last Wednes-
day, the snow created traveling
troubles for anyone who had to
commute to school. Some of the “
students living in the vicinity took
advantage of the extra studying
time While others spent leisure
moments having fun with the
whiteiwonder. The canceled class-
es were not as harmful to the
daytime students as to the night
school students, many of them
missing a week’s class work. With
four more weeks of winter re--
maining, the ehances that Oakland
will be visited again by snow is
probable, but all University memo
bers are hoping that it will not
be too soon. C’

Clothing Regulations

Found Disturbing
Editor. The Pitt News:

Having just read the article
in The Pitt News concerning the
new “clothing code,” I am deep-
ly disturbed. This entire police
action is unrealistic and a vio-
lation of the most elementary
rights of any individual.

What right have these student
representatives to impose upon
the students of this institution a
code which declares that Ber-
muda shorts may not be worn in
the cafeteria? What right? None!

This institution of higher
learning should be embarrassed

I that such a move was even made
by its student government re-
presentatives. It must be remem-'
bered that this is an institution
of higher learning and not a
grade school.

Coercive acts regarding cloth-
ing are only a slap at the type
of student found at the Univer-
sity. An atmosphere of dignity
must be maintained, and it will
be, if we could only get away
from the juvenile thinking which
-prevails here.

The statement issued regard-
ing this penal code. announced
that “this code is for those few
students who refuse to use good
taste in their dress.” I should
like to know what sort of police
state judgment is being used in
declaring Bermuda shorts an d
slacks bad taste in dress.

The issue is not only what is
bad taste and what is good taste
—and this cannot be denied as
an issue, but also what right do
these formerly stagnant legisla-
tive bodies have in arbitrarily
establishing a grossly unrealistic
standard and attempting to en-
force it‘?

Will the “procters” now look
at our ~d1'ess, as well as our
meal ticket numbers and trays
(for juice and salad)?

The word institution has real-
ly come to fit the nature of our
University, and institutional liv-
ing could not be more appropos

Card Playing
In Tuck Shop

The Senate has voted that card
playing will be allowed in the
Hunt Room and the Tuck Shop.
The motion grants that students
may play non-gambling card
games in these student restau-
rants except during the hours of
inconveniency between 11 a.m.

and 1 p.m.
In the senate discussion at last '

,Monday’s meeting it was brought
out that the present ruling is in-
congruous in that card playing is
permitted in the Hunt Room dur-
ing hours when the restaurant is
not busy.

Under this same ruling. card
playing of any kind is banned
from the Tuck Shop.

The Senate also passed a resolu-
tion to give recognition to two

new campus organizations, the

AIESEC, and the Amateur Radio
Association.

The AIESEC is a chapter of a
national group, which is working
on campus in conjunction with
the Cultural Exchange and the
Economics Department. The group
was given temporary recognition
until Sept. 1961.

The Radio Association, a group
of ham operators, was granted
permanent recognition.

GETTING DOWN TO CASES  .WITH AN ELECTRONIC COMPUTER

A young lawyer may spend many years searching through
the countless volumes in a law library before he ever
gets a chance to plead a case. His job is to research the
caseswhich may provide legal precedent. It's a very
necessary but tedious task.

Recently it was demonstrated that an IBM computer
could accomplish electronic retrieval of statutory law.
Nearly 2,000 statutes pertaining to a specific area of the
law were stored in the computer's memory. In response
to inquiries, the computer searched its memory at elec-
tronic speed and on instructions pointed out either
citations or the full text of relevant statutes. This was
accomplished in minutes. It might have taken a young
lawyer the entire day.

Putting computers to work in unusual ways is not new

at IBM. Computers are now doing remarkablejobs in
Interesting and important areas of business, industry,
science and government.

I-f you are interested in a company that offers you an
exciting career with virtually unlimited growth potential,
then you should investigate IBM. Positions are open in re-
search, development, programming and manufacturing.

The IBM representative will be glad to discuss any one

Panthers Blow
Chance for Bid
To Tournament

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

 

I’

IIIIIIIllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
'IIIIIIIIIIlillllllllllllllllllillj

Believe it or not the Panther basketball team had a slight chance
to pick up a berth in the National Invitational Tournament in New
York. Saturdays 73-59 loss to Penn State killed that chance.

At State the Panthers were booed and laughed at by the State
rooters, outplayed by the State basketball team and abused by the
“State" referees.

The Panthers were booed when John Fridley fouled State’s
Gene Harris. Harris had been dribbling through the Panther’s de-
fense and Fridley tried to, get the ball. He caught Harris with an
elbow on the temple.

They were laughing at the Panthers when Harris and Mark
DuMars began to bring the ball up court when the Cats when
pressing. Harris and DuMars dribbled behind their backs to the
delight of the State followers.

The abusement by the refs was just the failure to call many fouls

committed by the Lions mostly in the first half. Of course referees

have been accused of abusing teams ever since basketball began.

Coach Bob Timmons elected to go against State with a zone de-
fense. But the Lions built up a “good lead, and by the time the Pan-
thers switched to a man—to-man they had to foul in order to get back
in the ball game. State took advantage of the fouls and the Panthers
never did catch up. ‘

Coach Timmons apparently had more faith in his second
team than he did in his first. In the second half he inserted
them when the Panthers were down by ten. By the time he
started puting his regulars back in, the Lions had a 19 point
advantage.

In the ﬁrst half the Cats’ ﬁrst team was both hot and cold. Dur-
ing their cold spells, State would increase its lead, but the Panthers
always managed to get hot and keep the game close. In the second
half, Coach Timmons’ first team never had a chance to get hot.

If you are wondering how a team with" a 10-8 record could be
considered for a- post-season tournament, just remember that the
Panthers had won eight of their last 11 ball games, beating such
teams as Temple and Villanova. '

With St. Johns and St. Bonaventure going to the NCAA, the
NIT had to ﬁll quite a few vacancies. Pitt had a chance to step
into one of the spots. ..

But after Saturday’s ball game we can kiss that bid good bye.

He is selling the record, “The Impossible Pirates,” for a reduced price

While the wintry winds
were blowing through Uni-

ers were just a wee bit cooler
as they were blowing a '73-59
decision to Penn State Satur-
day night.

After a great come-from-behind
ﬁrst half which saw the Blue and
Gold trailing by ﬁve points, 33-28,
Coach Bob Timmons’ aggregation
proceeded to cool off. They missed

on almost all of their shots until ‘

the Nittany Lions built up an in-
surmountable 19 point lead.

In the early minutes of the sec-
ond half the Panther starters were
unable to hit from the ﬁeld or
from the foul line. After six min-
utes were gone the Lions had in-
creased their lead to ten points.

Pulled Out Regulars ‘

Coach Timmons began to pull
out his regulars and inserted his
whole second team, but they
failed to stem the attack as the

. Lions increased their lead to 52-

33 before Timmons put his regu-
lars back in the ball game.

By then the»game was about ‘

Gymnasts Lose

To Orangemen

Panthers May Face

Season Without Win
By LARRY HAGGERTY

Unless two previously postpon-
ed meets with Georgia Tech and
West Virginia can be rescheduled
in the next two weeks, it appears
as though Warren Neiger’s Pan-
thers gymnasts may suffer the
humiliation of going through the
1961 gym season without a single

victory.
Before the season started,
Coach Neiger ﬁgured that his

team lacked depth and would
have trouble competing with the
ﬁve other teams in the EIGL, but
he was confident that his Blue
and Gold gymnasts could handle
their two non—league opponents,
namely Georgia Tech and West
Virginia. with relative ease.

The Jungle Cats, however, saw
the chance to pick up these easy‘
wins go ﬂickering down the drain
due to the fact that snow storms
hit the Pittsburgh area just as
they were about to depart for At-
lanta and Morgantown respec-
ti\'ely. .

Up at Syracuse last Saturday
afternoon the Panther gymnasts
had high hopes of making the
Orange their ﬁrst victim of the

short 1-0 lead.

The Cats were down 11-4 arid
scored seven straight to tie it
up 11 all. State got hot and
jumped up to a 27-16 lead, but
ten straight by the Cats cut the
lead to one, 27-26, with 3:22
remaining in the half.

In that 3:22 the"Panthers scored
only one ﬁeld goal, a jump shot
by John Fridley, to State’s six
points. With a minute remaining
Howard Lockhart took a look at
the clock and thought time was
running out. He proceeded to cut
loose with an “Ozark Ike” shot
that nearly knocked the banking
board down.

at the Tartan’s Gymnasium. The
Panthers had four men in double
ﬁgures. . .

Cal Sheffield and Paul Martha

13 and Dave Sauer netted 12.
Steve Foels, who saw varsity ac-

losers with 11 points.

The Tech Jayvees, playing a
tight zone defense, were able to
keep within seven points of the
Cubs most of the ﬁrst half. Shef-
field connected with two jump
shots and two drives. Sauer tipped
in two buckets and Martha sank
two long jump shots. The half
ended with the Cubs on top 46-24.

Remains Undefeated

By BOB SlVIIZIK

Wrestling fans of Canons-
burg presented the Panthers
with a capacity crowd and
the Cats showed their ap-
preciation to the highly
partisan fans with a 17-13

win over the Maryland Terrapins.
A crowd of 1,150 people jammed
the Canon-McMillan High School
gym to root for the Panthers.

Despite the closeness of the
ﬁnal score, the Blue and Gold had
a fairly easy time with the in-
vaders. The Terps scored their
ﬁnal eight points after the Cats
had clinched the match.

Coach Rex Pcery summed up
the match in one sentence. "The
‘mighty mites’ were too tough."
Dick Martin, Larry’ Lauchle,
Daryl Kelvington and John Zoli-
koff provided the Panthers with
14 of their 17 points.

Extends Streak

Maryland had a 123 pounder,
Ron Maunder, who was supposed
to give Martin a tough match, but
such was not the case. The Pan-
ther junior completely dominated
the previously unbeaten Terp,
winning 6-0. Martin extended his
season record to 7-0 and has yet
to be beaten in a collective -dual
meet.

Lauchle lengthened the Pan-
ther’s lead by crushing Sam
Bossert, 10-0." The Olympian
just missed a chance to pin Bos-
sert in the closing seconds, but
the decision proved to be
enough.

After piling up  big lead, Kel-
vington pinned Wayne Smith with
a double chicken wing at the 7:34
mark. Zolikoff continued the
“Mighty Mites” reign by decision-
ing Pat Varre, 6-3. It was sweet
revenge for Zolikoff, who had lost
to Varre in last year’s Wilkes
'I‘ournarnent..

Lack of Sentiment

Two high school teammates got
together in the 157 pound class.
Augie Arrigone and Gern Kerin
wrestled together at Cecil High
School, which is now a part of
Canon-McMillan. Kerin showed a
lack of sentiment. by pinning the
Panther at 3:41.‘

Jim Harrison clinched the
match for the Blue and Gold.
‘Jungle’ Jim was triumphant
over Carl Offenbacher, 5-1.
With the match. now out of
reach, the. Terrapins made a
comeback.

Bill Rishell pinned Chuck
Shaffer at the 7:15 mark. Shaffer
had gone into the ﬁnal period
with a 1-0 lead, but  unable to
hold it.

Bob Guzik was pitted against
a mountainous 255 pounder, Roger
Shoals. The huge Terp_ proved to
be a ﬁne wrestler and handled
Guzik with ease. Shoals amassed
an 8-0 lead in the ﬁrst period
and then exchanged points with
Guzik for the remainder oi‘: the
match to win 12-4.

But it was too little, too late
tor the Terps.

   

Intramural
Curtailed by Snow
In Closing Weeks

Heavy snowfall, which closed
the University for a half day
last week, also curtailed the in-
tramural basketball program.

Key games involving leaders in
most of the loops were cancelled
because of the weather.

This left standings uncertain,
as the regular season draws to a
close, with two to three weeks -of
league play ‘ remaining before

Departing Coach
Honored at Lunch
By Many F nends
By TED coL'roN
Vic Fusia, departing Pan-
ther backﬁeld coach, was hon-
ored at a luncheon at Frankie
G u s t i n e ’ s last Thursday.
Fusia is heading for the
University of Massachusetts
where he will take on the head
coaching job.
_ Members of the press, radio,
television and University olﬁcials
attended. Chet Smith, Press Sports
Editor, was master of ceremonies
at the informal luncheon.
Frank Carver was the first to
speak,“ We are all sorry to see
Vic go, and we wish him the best
in his new job.”
Carver Comments
C a 1' v e r continued jokingly,
"with the addition. of Bimbo Cec-
coni and Bill Kaliden to the foot-
ball staff we will have the quiet-
est coaching staff in the country.”
John Michelosen added that
he would miss Fusia and re-
marked, “With Vic gone we
won’t have anybody to ﬁght the
installation of the single-wing.”
At this point oi‘ the luncheon
Mel Cratsley, Carnegie Tech’s
basketball coach and Athletic Di-
rector, made an appearance. Crat-
sley, an old friend of Fusia, re-
lated some of his favorite stories
of the Panther coach:
Early Bird
“We both took a job in a mill
and I was advised if I worked
hard and kept my nose clean and
my hands dirty I could get ahead.
So I came to work an hour early,
worked my lunch hour and stayed
an hour later than everybody else.
“Vic came to work an hour
late, took two hours for lunch
and went home an hour early.
As a result when one of the
bosses wanted something done
they would say to Vic, ‘What do
you think about this Mr.
Fusia?’ And they would say to
me, ‘Hey you get the hell down
here and pick that ‘hing up!’ ”i
Cratsley had rela'.:ed another
story: “When Vic was coaching
basketball and football up at In-
diana he contacted me and said,
‘Mel why don’t you come up here
and take over basketball. I’ll be

score of 52-43.

The only gymnasts to record
triumphs for the Blue and Gold
were Co-captain Joe Battaglia on
the ﬂying rings and Ed Zamecnik
on the high bar. The Orange
swept the side horse and also
scored ﬁrsts in tumbling, side

peted in his ﬁrst collegate dual

pion, as he captured This specialty

to Tech to pick up a few extra
credits I would need for teach-

left Indiana and I T1-ad to get a

After the laughing died down,

Aiiiiiaitic Cats Edge  C
With Twin Relay Wlins

Visitors Capture Seven. Dual Meet Events;
Haas, Sarsﬁeld, Keller Score Solo Victories

FLEIVIING

The Mermen have finally done it! For the ﬁrst time this
season, the Aquatic Cats have brought their record above
the .500 mark. Twin victories in the relays gave the Panthers
the edge in their 52-4.3 triumph over VMI.

Last week, Coach Grady said, “I know the competition
will be pretty even with the last relay deciding the winner.”
OGrady’s

prophecy proved true.
The Panther victory on the 400
yard freestyle relay stole the vic-
tory from the awaiting ﬁngertips
of the VMI squad.

Tony Sarsﬁeld, Carl Warnes,
Dick Rush and Bart Haas teamed
up in the last event to cop both
the relay victory and the meet
triumph.

In the course of the meet,
however. the Panther Mermen
captured only four solo ﬁrst
places. Bart Haas was a. double
winner; Tony Sarsﬁeld set a
record in the 200 yard butterﬂy,
and Kevin Keller won the div-
ing event.

Haas scored both of his vic-
tories in the short distance sprints.
Haas came through for the Pan-
thers in both the 50 and 100 yard
freestyle events. Kevin ,Keller’s
victory in the diving was his ﬁrst
this year, which shows he’s im-
proving.

Under some of the stiffest
competition all year, Sarsﬁeld
proved to be in rare form, cov-
ering the 200 yards with a but-
terﬂy stroke in 2:18.’! and shat-
tering the old record.

Panther Standout,
Moves To Varsity

Lou “Bimbo” and Bill Kal-
iden were named to fill the
vacancies on the Panther
football staff by head coach
John Michelosen last Thurs-
day. Cecconi, along with Carl
DePasqua will replace Vic Fusia
as backﬁeld coach.

Fusia will be taking on the head
coaching job at the University of
Massachusetts which is in the
Yankee Conference. Kaliden will
replace Cecconi as Panther fresh-
men coach.

Cecconi is a former Panther‘
gridiron great. He came to the
University in 1946 and proceeded
to delight Pitt followers with ‘his
clutch performances, although he
weighed less than 160 pounds and
was only ﬁve-nine.

Undefeated Team
‘ cAfter several years in the Army
and tw high school coaching jobs,
Cecconi came to Pitt in 1958. Tak- "
ing over the freshman coaching
chores, Cecconi led the Panther
Cubs to an undefeated season this
past year, their ﬁrst since 1955.
Cecconi said, “I View Vic's
departure with mixed emotions.

I hate to see him go and yet

I’m happy to get the chance at

this new job. I appreciate the

0DD0I‘l»‘llI1ity to assist Coach

Michelosen. I hope I can do as

good a job as Vic has done in

the last six years.”

Kaliden will be taking over his
ﬁrst official coaching job. During
the past football season he help-
ed Cecconi with the t'rcshmen
and was instrumental in guiding
the yearlings to the unbeaten sea-
son.

Kaliden Takes Over

On several occasions when Cec-
coni was on scouting assignments
Kaliden coached the frosh team
when they were playing-

Bill graduated from the Uni-
versity in 1959 after playing
quarterback for the Panthers
for three years. His most famous
feat came when he carried over
the winning touchdown in 1953’:

seconds remaining.

Kaliden commented, "I am
grateful. for the conﬁdence that
Coach Michelosen and Mr. Carver
have displayed in me and I will
do my best to live up to that con- 42- *
ﬁdence.” .

“protesting the unfair clothing
code}

Many of the co-eds carried
signs, in their meager attempt
to “fight city hall”. They in-
cluded such statements as
“Jackie Kennedy wears slacks;
why can’t we?” and “What kind
of an Ivy League is this?’

Most of the “pickets" felt justi-
fied in their actions, however con-
fused, shouting their reasons in
something less than unison.

The battered ear of this writer
absorbed such statements as
“since we aren’t allowed to vote
for the rules that govern us, why
should we obey them” and “girls
in other schools can wear slacks
to dinner, so we can too.”

Most Liberal School

The committee of students that
wrote the “code,” had submitted
the document for Dr. Swartz-
baugh for approval.

enforce what these students
have decided."

Enforcement of the “code” must
come from officers such as ﬂoor
councilors, and not from the Saga
Food Service. Saga reports that
it will co-operate, but will not
sit as judge because it serves as
a food service program.

Saga officials state that even
with the new code Pitt is “the
most liberal school" concerning
clothing policy, that the company
serves. In such schools as West-
ern Reserve, John Carroll, and
Oberlin, men are required to wear
coats and ties, women hose and
‘sensible shoes’ at dinner.
