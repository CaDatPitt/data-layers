Aldo “Ike” Icardi, former head
cheerleader and principle leader
of Pitt’s pre-war Independent As-
sociation, threw jabs at a lethargic
student body and a complacent ad-
ministration at a meeting of the
newly formed independent group
last; Friday.

Icardi warned the assembly that
“until students made themselves
heard through a competent, active
organization, administrative offi-

cials of the University would con-

tinue to ignore the extremely

for students to have a social life
at Pitt."

“The present student ‘govern-
ment (Student Congress) is de-
signed to be the tool of adminis-
tration, to be used whenever the
administration is bothered by some
problems thatare easier pushed
aside than solved,” stated the in-
dependent leader.

His proifered solution isa rep-
resentative form of government
made up of students elected from
the various undergraduate schools
according to registrar’s office ﬁg-
ures. He proposed one representa-
tive for every hundred students
enrolled.

Currently a p{—:11‘:lOl’1 is pending
before Student.Congress concern-
ing a change in representation

pressing problem of lack of spacer

 

and five women, rather than seven
women and seven men according
to- the present constitution.

Icardi denounced the petition as
“not ﬁlling the bill.” V,

Ike explained that an earlier
attempt on the part of the Inde-
pendent organization he headed,
failed to achieve its goals because
of the war’s interruption. He‘ add-
ed that it is now possible to at-
tain the aims his organization
sought.

After Icardi‘s speech, members
of the new Independent body dis-
cussed the proposed constitution
for the organization. Objections to
several-of its parts prevented con-
stitutional ratiﬁcation at the meet-
ing.

Ratiﬁcation is expected at the
next Independet meeting to be an-
nounced by the steering committee
of the group.

Girls Visualize
‘Pill of Future‘

Coeds representing their re-
spective classes indulge in a bit
of crystal-gazing on Thursday in
the YW—-YWHA, at 3:30 p .m.

In keeping with the Interclass

Sing theme, “Pitt of the Future,”

the women will try to visualize the
University as it might conceivably
look in years to come.

The winning team will claim for
its class the Interclass Sing cup,
which is now on display in the
twelfth. ﬂoor office of thedean of
women.

The cup is retained by the class
which places ﬁrst in three consec-
utive sings. Winners of each year’s
sing, however, have the name of
their class engraved on the fac
of the trophy. '

No class is in 5 position this year
to gain permanent possession of
the prize. Since last year’s win-
ners, the class of ’48, have but one
more opportunity to compete, Jean
Stickle, sing chairman, announces
that there is no immediate danger
that the cup will leave its present
niche in 1209.

judging committee thisyear. Other

Cl1ild’s Play
J Give a naughty little boy a piece of chalk

and sooner or later some four letter words will
make" their appearance on public places.

Give that same naughty little boy enough
education to lend a pseudo-intelligence to his
smug little prejudices and his “four—letter”
expressions will have the effect of a low. body

. blow.

Recently, a Pitt student with highly intol-
erant views on the Palestine partition question
has been chalking anti—Jewish phrases on black-
boards in the nationality room and classrooms
on the third ﬂoor. Evidence of his vindictive-
ness can still be seen in the word “Arab” on
the wall of the third ﬂoor corridor.

This sort of childish spite is shocking in
that it appears in an institution of higher
learning. One would expect, perhaps, divergent
views on controversial matters ——~ but never
scrawlings with chalk. With the beneﬁts of
advanced education, Pitt students should sure-
ly have more tolerant methods of expression.

It’s disgusting -—— especially disgusting at
Pitt, one of America’s largest cross—section col-
leges. , ‘

The 0111 Refrain

. Undoubtedly one problem confronting" stu-'

dents and faculty alike in the Cathedral, out-
side of classwork, is , boarding an elevator.
There are eight now in service. In normal times
these eight elevators were suﬂicient to carry
the University crowd. But these are not normal

times, and it is obvious that the handling of
trafﬁc is inadequate. Hallways are choked, and
students late for classes unnecessarily.

As things stand now, four small cars and one

large one handle the local traﬂic, while three ‘

large cars operate express. Since congestion oc-
curs at the transfer of classes, and since local
cars are the ones in greatest demand, one or
both of these suggestions may prove useful at
those hours:

1. The heavy local_ traffic should be carried
by the four larger elevators.

2. Express cars should pick up passengers
and discharge them on the first ﬂoor.

By having the expresses operate from the
ﬁrst floor, you eliminate the human bloc set up
in the ground ﬂoor lobby. Getting through it

-‘is as tough as trying to get an elevator.

Certainly if no arrangement, other than the
one now in use can be found, one can always
use'the steps.

Author Claims New Styles
Onslaught on U. S. Purse

Fashion changes which have brought the radically new

styles to the United States are merely. another onslaught by
foreign designers on the American pocketbook in the opinion of
Philip Wylie, noted author, and observer of the contemporary

American scene.

And just as long as American womensubmitt to these for-
eigndictators they can’t aﬁford to look down their noses at
Ubangi women for inserting a plate in their lip, he declares.

“For modern’fashion has become a big business, controlled

not by milady’s real desire for novelty, her good taste and proper

love of ornament, but by a mere commercial greed of the most
cynical and exploitattious variety,” Wylie says in an article in
the November issue of Cosmopolitan magazine.

“The world of fashion has one purpose; to make as much

moxﬁay as it can, as fast as pos—¢

sible, from Mrs. and Miss Am-
erica. Thus, the changing fashions

no longer follow cultural tend-
encies, but, if anything, precipi-
tate such tendencies.

“ ‘Designer" is a very good name
for those who promote‘ the fraud;
they have designs on one thing;
America’s pocketbook.”

Fashion designers who have de-
signs on the American pocket-
book have one tried and true
formula, according to Wylie, who
asserts;

“Each new style has been one
that has made ‘milady’s extant
wardrobe obsolete. Fashion’s aim
has become to shame American
women into constant buying with-
out any real need at all. The
technique of mass panic has been
mercilessly employed, through
advertising and h i g h-pressure

‘public relations, to keep the ladies

afraid that what they have in the
way of clothes is forever too long,

short, wide, narrow, plain or or-
nate.

“Today it is impossible for a
woman to be dressed ‘correctly’
for more than a few -months with-
out new clothes.” '

American women should be
bright enough, in Wylie’s opinion,
to apply the brakes on an ex-
ploitation of themselves which
periodically makes them look. ab-
surd, often injures their health,
and constantly sabotages their
bank accounts.

“A few new attitudes are need-
ed,” he asserts. “First would be
a general appreciation of the fact
that any dress or garment which
is beautiful to .wear is always
beautiful, faddish or not. Next
should come the simple admission
that anything which restricts nat-
ural functions is both criminal
and hideous. Finally the public
should perceive that women who
sedulously follow fashion today,
are, one and all, prize suckers on
history’s greatest sucker’s list.”

Men Prefer Daring Dresses

On »Otl1er  Men's Women

Conﬁdential tip to the girls——men like daring dresses only
on the other fellow’s girl——not theirs.

That was the essence of opinion expressed by a group of
collegians, including Eugene Rossides of Columbia football
fame, who served on Cosmopolitan j1nagazine’s mal-tested fash-
ion jury at New York ’s Stork Club.

’ “Believe it or not they" voted consistently for gowns with

some covering over ‘shoulder cue

upper arm' or with narrow
shoulder straps,” Kay Wister,
fashion editor of the magazine de-
clared. “The completely bare
shoulder decolletage was some-
thing delightful-—-to them-only
on the other fe11ow’s girl.”
Typical of college men through-
out the country, many of them
having returned from overseas
service,,they represented a cross-
section of male opinion as to how
e like their women to dress.

Cornell, Amherst, Columbia, Dart-
mouth, the University of Missouri
and the University of Nebraska.
“Generally the boys approved
of dresses that had a sophisticated
but not too exposed loo ,” Mrs.
Wister said. “In fact it’s a look
the boys pronounced ‘dreamy’.”
Rossides was particularly im-
pressed with the slit hemline of
one of the winning dresses which
embodies all the fashion points

   

Meefs a Necessity
With :1 Mistake.

Issue

“""""*—'by Bill Veenis

:1-’

The question of proportional representation for
Student Congress has appeared on the bull session
agenda many times since the launching of the

constitution some three and a half years ago.

Then, of course, the University was in that ex-
cuse of the century-—World War II. The constitu-
tion was passed by the student body exactly one
year? following the mass exodus of the male element
on campus. At that time, the ratio of three women
to every man existed. _ ‘

Certain advantages of the three to one ratio
were evident. But not in the political ﬁeld. The
Congress constitution went through with little or
no question from the Law School embryo attor-
neys. It was, and is, full of vast loopholes. It passed
unquestioned.

One of the big questions is how it went through
without any quibbling over the even representation
when the women were way out in.-front.

The fact, now, shows that the men hold the
same advantage as the women held then. Some-
where between then and now, the even proportion
between men and women students existed. Now,-
the men are complaining. «-

The amendment proposed by a group of campus
leaders calls for “proportional representation.” It
states that ten men and ﬁve _ women shall com-
pose the new Student Congress.

This does not seem like proportional repre-
sentation. Rather, it is an arbitrary determination
made, from the surface, as a matter of convenience.
The remarkable element of the amendment is that
the men who proposed it, generally speaking, are
well aware of "political consequences of hasty ac-
tions. Yet, the amendment will come up for a vote
before the student body in a few short weeks.

Already, the women’s groups have placed a
solid blonk against the move. And, last Friday,
“Ike” Icardi urged the Independents to consider
twice before voting for the amendment. He claimed
it was “inadequate.”

For my own part, I wonder if the amendment‘
wasn’t prematurely placed on the voters’, market.
The principle of proportional representation could
have been worked out fair1y—and’ more import-
ant--on a factual basis. If an amendment must be

Sees Fine Prospects

By Vivian Colonna

Forty men and a girl. To most ‘coeds that’s a nice ratio,
but to Veronica Vargo, who is treading on a ﬁeld ordinarily
reserved for men, that’s pretty stiif competition.’
, Blonde, doll-sized Veronica is the only girl in the Uni-
.Versity’s geophysics class. Prospecting for oil is her goal, and
she doesn’t mean the brand her classmates are tempted to gush
when she walks into the evening class taught by Dr. Sigmund

Hammer of the Gulf Research Lab-%

oratory.

“Somebody has to ﬁnd new oil
supplies, and there’s no reason
why a woman can’t do it,” she
says, her green eyes ﬂashing.

“Don’t misunderstand,” she
laughed. “I don’t intend to chase
all over the country sinking test
wells. My job will be backstage
in the research laboratories search-
ing for the geological conditions
that point to accumulations of oil.”

_ She has not accepted the longer
fashions, and her classmates eye
.With approval her skirts swishing

“Long skirts look silly on any

that,” she explains.

Ronnie never has to worry

ceived a grant of $60,000 from the
W. K. Kellogg Foundation, Battle
Creek, Michigan.

The grant will help support
three major projects: development
of industrial nursing, training of
additional supervisors in psychiat-
ric nursing, and establishment of

. a workshop in nursing education.

Dr. Kuehn explained the need
for nurses of mental patients.

“The Veterans administration is
recruiting 800 psychiatric nurses.
These are only to meet theimme—
diate needs of the veterans in the
hospitals. Above and beyond this
the State of Pennsylvania is seek-
ing trained women for its civilian
mental institutions, for which
there has always been a shortage
of nurses.”

The third part of the program
will service on-the-job nurses.
Nursing teachers and supervisors
will bring pfoblems to the Work-
shop for the advice and assistance
of specalists. The libraries and lab-
oratories of the School of Nursing
will be available to them.

Dr. Kuehn feels that the grant
is a ﬁne tribute to the School of
Nursing which, although only in
its seventh year, has received the
highest accrediting as a member
of three leading nursing associa-
tions.

Insurance Pay

Dividends scheduled to be paid

erans’ life insurance policies could
be wiped out if a U. S. court rul-
ing in Chicago last June is up-
held by the Supreme Court, ac-
cording to an Associated Press
report.

In its ruling, the U. S. Circuit
Court of Appeals at Chicago held
the beneﬁciary of a veteran’s Na-
tional Service Life Insurance pol-
icy must receive the full face value
of his policy, plus interest, every
ten years.

The $l,700,000,0(/0 which Feder-
al attorneys believe the new de-
cision will add in payments to
beneﬁciaries, would make it im-
possible to pay veterans dividends

Consistent with former policy,
Pitt has been invited to send four
delegates. They are to be chosen
from student applicants by a fac-
ulty committee appointed last
month by Dr. Stanton Crawford,
dean of the College._ Lastlyear, at

And won’t ﬁnd in books.

You are going to consider using aluminum
for some purpose where the engineering isn’t
all spelled out for you. You’ll want facts about

aluminum that you can apply

lem; and guidance in using them.

When that happens, remember to call on the
brains that have stored up more knowledge of
aluminum than you can ﬁnd anywhere _else.
For 59 years this brain has been gathering facts
and experience in making aluminum useful in

thousands of ways.

details with the local Chesterfield .

By Myron Kopelman
PiKA, Pitt’s intramural grid champs, and Theta Xi, Tech titlists,

Pitt-Tech football rivalry when

they clashed on Friday at Tech for the intramural title of Oakland.

19-7 but little friendship passed

‘between the two teams.

Both teams and their 300 fol-
lowers thought they were being
“robbed” by the ofﬁcials; conse-
quently the playing became some-
what rough. Although" this was
touch football, many a ball carrier
wondered if he hadn’t been slightly
more than touched.

Ken Cochran and Frank Dough-
erty, however, remained sufficient-
ly unperturbed to pass the PiKA’s
to victory. A

Cochran Throws TD Passes"

Cochran accounted for the two
PiKA touchdowns by throwing to
Daugherty and then to Francis
Manella, each time from the Theta
Xi three—yard line. Jack Berger
skirted end after the second TD
for the only successful conversion.

PiKA’s six remaining points re- ,
sulted from a unique method of
scoring which awards one point
for every ﬁrst down. The length -
of the sticks, however, is 15 yards.

Nelson Greene, a skinny, slip-
pery fellow who wore a basket-
ball ,eye guard, made upgthe whole

of the Tech team’s offense. Early _

in the second quarter Greene pass-
ed 30 yards to Elmer Kalin who
accepted on the PiKA ten and,
s-curried therernaining distance to
paydirt.

’ Contest Gets Rough

In the fourth quarter Greene
received .a punt and swept down“
the sideline 40 yards to the PiKA
12 where he was knocked out of
bounds so hard he sailed through
the sideline spectators and down
a nearby hillside.

It was fully ﬁve minutes before
his spare frame was restored to
the ﬁeld and the game continued.

The PiKA offense showed more
versatility and effectiveness than
that of the Tech team. The back-
ﬁeld of Berger, Cochran, and
Daugherty, by use of the lateral-
pass and the pass-lateral, put the
Tech team in a muddled state.

Four such plays netted a total
of 70 yards. 3

Berger, Amos Run Hard

Cochran handled the short pass-
es for PiKA, while Daugherty
threw the long ones. The ﬁeld
was muddy, often causing Daugh-
erty to slip and fall in the act of
passing. .

Berger and Bill Amos, a ﬂeet
little back, did little passing, but
made their presence felt by run-
ning the ball brilliantly, .

It was the second straight year
that PiKA captured the intramural
championship of Oakland. Last
year they defeated Tech’s' Tau Del-
ta Tau, 7-6.

Pitt has two men who rank on
the all—time-all great basketball
team. They are A1l—Americans
Charles Hyatt and Claire Cribbs.

6 Strictly rumor, the report, if

true, would put out of commis-
sion a student group that has been
represented on campus since April
8, 1946. -At that time they were
given probationary recognition by
the University Committee on
Recognition of Student Organiza-
tions. '

April 14, 1947 the PVA was
given full recognition by “the com-
mittee to join the circle of student
organizations on campus.

If truth results from what is
now rumor, an organization that
once boasted 1400 members, will
bow gracefully from social and
political functions.

The PVA ,headed a petition to ~

the city last year requesting
streetcar passes for veterans, but
was stymied by the Pittsburgh

Railways Co. when they ruled it A

would be “discriminating.”

Last spring they created a ‘Liv-
ing Memorial’ fund to provide “a
living memorial for the sons and
daughters of deceased alumni of
World War II.”

Although rumors have come
from generally reliable sources, no
statement has been made by the
Association Board of Directors.

Mighty News’ Cagers

1 Dare Panther to Play

There’s a bit of tradition which pops up every year on the

.eighth ﬂoor. Among the three publications (Owl, Panthers,

News), it’s known as “separating the men from the boys.”_
News Editor Bill Veenis perpetuated the tradition this
Inorning’by challenging the Panther and Owl staffs to a basket-

ball game.

Usually, the challenge is hurled only to the Panther. But

knowing the “laugh-a-letes” would’

be unable to ﬁnd ﬁve men, Veenis
sportingly included the Owl.

No Men on Owl
Eighth ﬂoor hanger-ons express-
ed doubt as to whether the year
book pansies would be able to
contribute a man.

Last year the mighty News cag-
ers played under wraps and still
_walloped the Panther, 31-10. This
year, however, Veenis is worried.

“You know," he said, “both Per-
kinson and Zeller returned to the
school spirit crowd this year. This
Zeller was quite a rah-rah boy
at Hamline U. (St. Paul, Minn.),
and he won’t take this laying
down. A ,

Perkinson Wants Revenge

“I don't have to remind you,”
he continued, “Perkinson has been
using sports’ jargon——‘our team is

red hot’—and he still remembers
that crushing softball defeat.”
Despite Veenis’ apprehension,
the odd-makers installed the News
quint as 5-1 favorites or if you
want even money, you can get the
Panther-Owl combo and 30 points.

bored during the off season—-quot-

The 1941 Pitt basketball team

ahead, the Panthers continue pol-
ishing the ﬁgure eight offense. The
Madison opener will probably see
Bill Cieply and Sam David at the
guards, Ed Latagliata and Dodo
Canterna at Fordwards, and Mort
Lerner in the center slot.
. Four. out of the ﬁrst ﬁve are
regular starters from last year’s
team. New comer Mort Lerner
never played college ball but has
had extensive service experience.
In addition, a lot of help will

be expected from Tom Ragan,
Bimbo Cecconi, and Ted Gerem-
sky. The latter two are footballers
who have reported late for prac-
tice. Ragan was a regular on the
'43-’44 team.

Locals Eliminated

After. Early Drive

Powerful PiKA staved oﬁ” a ﬁrst period scoring threat by
the Locals Thursday then roared back like real champions to
capture their second straight IM Crown, 7-2.

Almost 200 chilled partisans lined the Stadium gridiron to
watch the undefeated frat boys roll to their tenth victory. Two
days before, the two playoff participants had played to a 6-6

deadlock.

The smooth functioning Garnet and Gold six scored with
less than two minutes remaining in the ﬁrst half. Slim Frank
Daugherty uncorked a dandy heave which Joe Ingelido snagged
in the end zone for what proved to be the winning margin.

Ken Cochran’s pass to Bill Amos

acounted for the extra point.
Drive Carried 65 Yards

Ingelido’s TD culminated a drive
that carried 65 yards. Alternating
long and short passes, Cochran
and Frank Daugherty connected
repeatedly to Amos, Jack Berger,
and Tom Livingstone.

Livingstone’s great diving catch
on the Locals 15-yard line set up
the tally.

Prior to the PiKA score, the L0-
cals had marched to the Garnet
and Gold ﬁve-yard stripe on the
strength of Bob Brubakeris pass-
ing and some ﬁne receiving by Bob
Wicks, Bill Camp, and ‘Tom La-
boon.

Locals Fail to Score

Ingelido stopped the threat by
intercepting a Brubaker heave
and running it out to the PiKA
15. His interception followed a
near Locals score which misﬁred

when a TD pass was dropped in
the end zone.

However, the Locals registered
their two points late in the third
quarter when Dick Ruth trapped
Berger in the PiKA end zone.

The hard fought contest was a

tribute to the coaching ability of

the rival mentors. Joe Mueller, E
'49, guided PiKA, while Bob Kane,
C ’48, steered the Locals.

“Emerson’s New England,” a
group of twenty-ﬁve panel pic-
tures, will be on exhibition in the
fine arts library until Dec. 17.‘

The exhibition is sponsored by
Life Magazine and is based on t.he
photographic essay, “New England
Indian Summer.” Emerson‘s New
England deals with places and
place—names especially associated
with Emerson, Thoreau, Ha_w-
thorne, Alcott, and Longfellow.

The photographic essay begins
by showing Concord and the ex-
teriors and interiors of houses
there, such as Old Manse and Way-
side. The photograplis then move
to Walden, Brook Farm, Maver-
hill, Cambridge, Boston; then back
to close with open air of Concord
and Concord River.

Captions for the pictures are al-
most composed of excerpts taken
from the 19th century New Eng-
land writers themselves. There is
no “criticism” or descriptive ma-
terial, but simply quotationsfrom
~ Hawthorne, Alcott, and Emerson
