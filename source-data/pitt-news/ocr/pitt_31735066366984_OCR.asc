UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Increased Enrollment,
"b New Quarters Slated

For Librar School

x ~ . » . ..

rarily house the Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences.

“The Library School is on the
move,” Vice-Chancellor of the
Professions A. C. Van Dusen said.
On the spot investigation found
that this statement was meant
literally.

The Graduate School of Li-

$"brary and Information Sciences,
according to Dean Harold Lan-
cour, is increasing its enrollment
and moving to larger temporary
quarters on the fourth and ﬁfth
ﬂoors of the American Institute
for Research.

The new facilities, which in-
clude a library with three times
the seating capacity, more offices,

/ two classrooms, and the innova-

/ tion of a student lounge, were
planned by the Library School
and its active student organiza-
tion.

u

The enlarged space will allow
the school to increase at the rate
of 50 full-time students a year.
There were 57 students when the
School of Library and Informa-
tion Science was part of Carne-
gie Institute of Technology but
since its affiliation with the Uni-
versity in 1962 enrollment has
increased to 422 students.

The demand for graduates from
library schools is so great that
the 37 graduate schools in the
United States and Canada cannot
meet the need, remarked Dean
Lancour.

The permanent home of the
Graduate School of Library and
Information Sciences will be in
the Professional Quadrangle lo-

, cated where Forbes Field is pres-
 ently situated. The Hillman Li-
brary will be the ﬁrst building in

this quadrangle.

Public Affairs Speaker Says
US. Should Stay In Vietnam

By BERNI MCLEOD

Arnaud de Borchgrave,
Newsweek’s chief European
correspondent, has seen
many wars and co-nﬂicts. His
latest study, the crisis in
Vietnam, leaves him with
but one opinion: America cannot
afford to pull out.

At a noon lecture, held last
Wednesday in the Student Union
Supper Room, de Borchgrave em-
phasized the importance of the
current Asian crisis. “More is at
stake than South Vietnamese ter-
ritory,” he said. “The Commun-
ists are running an experiment
in warfare.”

With the advent of the Atomic
bomb, Communists could no long-
er acquire territory by force.
They could not risk United States
intervention and the possible dis-
aster of nuclear war. China and
Russia were in a dilemma. How
could they convert the world and
yet not be open aggressors?

According to de Borchgrave,
China is now experimenting with

  Graduates Win Grants

Richard Edward Grandy, a 1963
graduate of the University, and
Jon Michael Dunn, a graduate

student at the University and a »

Ph.D. candidate in philosophy,
both won Dissertation Fellow-
ships from the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship . Foundation.

Formerly a mathematics major,
Grandy changed his major ﬁeld
to philosophy, but has combined
his two interests bywriting his
thesis on The Hilbert Program
and the Foundations of Mathe-
matics, a study of the philosophy
of mathematics.

The Dissertation Fellowship, ef-
fective Sept. 1, will make it pos-
sible for Grandy to do some of
his research in Paris and to con-
tinue his researches at Princeton
University where he is a candi-
date for the Ph.D. degree.

Dunn is currently working full
time on his research and writing
for his thesis on The Algebra of
Intensional Logics. He won a
Woodrow Wilson Fellowship for
ﬁrst-year graduate study during
his senior year at Oberlin Col-
lege in 1963.

Woodrow Wilson Dissertation
Fellowships are awarded after a
jury of specialists in the candi-
date’s ﬁeld reviews all theses pro-
posals and candidates’ records.
Selection committees make awards
on the basis of the best proposals
presented by the most qualiﬁed
candidates in each group under
review, according to Dr. Larson
Crowe, director of the Founda-
tion’s dissertation program.

In the four years since the pro-
gram’s inception, 48 per cent of
all holders of Dissertation Fel-
lowships completed their Ph.D.’s
in the four and one quarter year
time limit set by the Foundation.
Another 12 per cent ﬁnished
shortly thereafter, Dr. Crowe
stated.

“We consider this a good rec-

ord.  late as 1960-61 Americans A

 

 

awarded Ph.D.’s in the human-
ities that year reported that 12
years elapsed between their ﬁrst
year of graduate school and the
award of the doctorate. We be-

_lieve that humanists and social

scientists engaged in sustained
and uninterrupted study can pro-
duce dissertations of high qual-
ity in just over four year’s time,”
Dr. Crowe -explained.

The Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation, operating
under grants from the Ford Foun-
nation, has as its aim the encour-
agement and support of potential
college teachers.

LA Extends
Time Period
For Drops

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

The‘ School of Liberal Arts
(LA) has extended "the time per-
iod during which students may
withdarw from courses, according
to Dr. Norman W, Mulgrave, as-
sistant to the dean of LA.

‘ The extension, a two-week per-
iod, allows a student to drop a
course during the ﬁrst six weeks
of the term. This action was
suggested by the Academic Stat-
us Committee and approved by
the Executive Council and the
Academic Assembly of the School
of LA.

“This period had been extend-
ed because students are frequent-
ly unable to determine how suc-
cessfully they are performing in
their total program within the
four-week period,” Mulgrave com-
mented. “It is presumed that stu-
dents will have more information
on which to base a decision after
ﬁve or six weeks. Therefore, the
last day for withdrawing from a
course this spring term is Fri-
day,’_’ he added.

Although a Viet Cong defeat is

Dr. Kehl Announces  
1965-1966 Dean’s Listed-cl

The Dean’s List for full-time
Liberal Arts (LA) students dur-
ing the Winter trimester has been
issued by the Dean of LA James
A. Kehl.

The list is composed of 597
students who have achieved a

minimum of a 3.25 (cum laude ‘

average) record for the term. Of
this total, 43 students earned 4.0
averages. -

Dean Kehl pointed out that in
the fall, 12 per cent of the full-
time ‘LA students achieved Dean’s
List status, while 16 per cent at-
tained this goal during the Winter
term.

In the fall trimester, 21 students
(4.5 per cent of the total Dean’s
List) recorded 4.0 averages,
whereas 43 students achieved
this distinction last term, repre-

School Spirit Needed

._— ‘ For ‘News’ Mistakes
‘ L ‘ Editor, The Pitt News

In reply to the May 18 letter

.:. fiby ‘Misses Redniss, Wascou, and
 V Weller it should be stated that
".The Pitt News cannot be held

culpable for an unfortunate sit-

I uation. Though it may be true

that The Pitt News may not be
what it once was, this is not the
papers’ fault. How can one in

 ‘good conscience blame a news-
‘ paper which has been pleading
 j for additional help, for what is
Q essentially a problem of under-

staffing? If the students would
reply to The Pitt News pleas for

I ‘help as enthusiastically as they

‘  reply to a sentence fragment, The

‘ "Editor, The Pitt News

The point of view reﬂected in

J‘ the May 11 Pitt News article

about Eric Lieberman and the

This article and others appear-

sport athletics are not worthy
supporting or engaging in unless

_the team is winning and unless

. _, the University is so determined
' to win that it will provide ath-

Apologies Offered

For Previous Letter
Editor, The Pitt News

My sincere apologies to Stu-
dents for Peace and to Mr. Mc-
Andrews of GSPIA (please ex-
cuse the acronym) for my letter
of May 11, which was in ques-

tionable taste. Mine was an at- .

tempt to inject a note of humor
into, and perhaps encourage de-
bate on a rather obscure subject,
the purpose of the Students for
Peace. Their selection of a Com-
munist, however prominent, for
a speaker does nothing to clarify
the subject, and only stimulates
doubt as to their pacifist nature.

It is therefore unfortunate that
the only criticism drawn by my
letter was Mr. Andrews’ (who

Another Day
Track Coach Carl Rees

Submits Final Decision

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

Carl Rees stepped into the teams bus which was parked

, along side Notre Dame’s track last Saturday. With a slight

quiver in his voice, he turned to his runners and hastily
announced his resignation from active coaching.

His decision didn’t come as a surprise. With the aid of
poor performance, internally, and caustic criticism, extern-
ally, a rumor concerning a change in the track situation had
been circulating since the beginning of the season.

Though others might have expected his resignation, the
 ,,  W realization for Rees must

" __ - have come with a great de-

..  gree of pain. From the emo-

tion in his voice, as described
by persons present on the

never been an easy one for
Rees to accept.

His ability as a coach isn’t
of concern now. As a person
he obviously loved his work.
His life has been devoted to
athletics. The conditioning
of the human body was his
goal.

His task had been ﬁlled
with obstacles at Pitt. He as-
sumed the head coaching
position in 1959, which
launched the era of this Uni-
versity’s experimentation
*with the trimester system.
The trimester, more than
any other single factor, has
killed the Spring sports
schedule here.

CARL REES But as Atheletic Director

Resigns Coaclzing Position Frank Carver Said, “Rees
took his punishment without ever complaining openly.”

Although he has withdrawn from coaching, Re-es will"

remain in the Athletic:DepartmentlTHis time will be de-
voted now completely to the teaching of physical education.

‘ and the seeking of a professorship.

For the track team the regulariseason has ended, but
Rees will remain as coach until June 4, which is the date of
the NCAA championships. Next weekend the IC4A’s will be
run. At least one Panther, Dick Crout, will be entering.

For Rees these last two weeks will be difficult ones
indeed. A

bus, the decision must have"

 
 

Many people avoid the number
13 with a passion. The baseball
team, however, looks for it with
an equal passion. The attainment
of this crafty number will de-
pend mainly on Dave Welty.

With a 7-5 record, the team
closes its season with six games
this week, beginning today against
Duquesne at Forbes Field at 3:30
p.m. Coach Bobby Lewis plans
to pitch Don Stock. Welty, an-
other pitcher whom Lewis can-
not do without, will be playing
left ﬁeld.

The lefthanded pitcher --out-
ﬁelder is quite an attention get-
ter. For one reason he is the
leading pitcher; for another he
is the leading hitter.

Winning his third game against
Allegheny last Friday, Welty
lowered his earned run average
from 0.77 to 0.51. With 14 strike-
outs, he ran his season total to
59 in 44 innings. Last week Wel-

Defeat Dukes, Bag “13”

ty collected five hits in nine at
bats to raise his average to .429.

His three hits against St. Vin-
cent coupled with shortstop Steve
Kienz1’s fourth home run en-
abled righthander Paul Helsel to
shutout the Saints, 5-0, on two
hits. For Helsel, it was his ﬁrst
appearance since pulling a rib
muscle a month ago.

Helsel’s performance relieved
Lewis’ mind somewhat. Before
this, Lewis faced six games with
only two starting pitchers, Welty
and Stock, available.
