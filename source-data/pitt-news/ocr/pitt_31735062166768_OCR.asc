Student Body
Questioned
On Opinions

In conjunction "with a Political
Science course at the Uni-versity,
a survey will be distributed sam-
pling the political opinions of
the student body. The su-rvey,
being dvistributed tomorrow is
being conducted by Donald E.
Lampert and Paul R. Horen-
stein, both junior political sci-
ence majors.

The survey will be available
in the Towers Lobby, the Stu-
dent Union and the Cathedral
basement. Lt will also be dis-
tributed in certain courses. Col-
lection boxes will be 'available
at the distribution points, or can
be sent by campus mail to Sur-
vey, c/0 D. E. Lampert, Political
Science Dept., 2317 CL.

The survey involves speciﬁc
background information which
will be correlated with political
part-‘icipa-t'ion, party raft‘-iliation,
and feelings toward -certain key
issues. The survey will also in-
clude a question on prospective
candidates for the 1968 Presi-
dential election.

According to Lampert, the
survey is not designed to test
any _major hypothesis about the
political leanings of University
students. Instead, it will attempt
to “discover the intensity and
consistency ‘of certain views
within the framework provided
by the background data.”

Opinions on issues such as
peaceful -co-existence, the effec-
tiveness of the United Nations,
the Vietnam conflict, and Black
Naltionalism will also be tested.

HOMECOMING FAVORS

Homecoming favors can be
picked up today from 11 am.
to 4 p.m. across from the SU
Desk. A ticket stub must be

Rabbi Discusses Tragedy

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ
Rabbi Arthur Lelyveld,
president of the American
Jewish Congress, spoke on
“The Negro Revolution and
the American Jew” at the

YM &.WHA last Thursday 9

afternoon.

He stated that -the tragedy of
the Negro revolution is that “ex-
cept for a few sponatic and dis-
organized outbursts, there has
been no genuine revolt on the
part of the Negro community”
and that “the Negro gives sup-
port to the establishment des-
pite violent talk.”

Rabbi Lelyveld said that the
Negro has shown “remarkable
patience” from the Emancipa-
tion Proclamation in 1854 to the
Brown decision in 1954, “the
first show against American
despot-ism.”

Rabbi Lelyveld compared the
non-violent techniques of the
1964 March on Washington with
today's black power techniques.
He -said the major difference
was that the 1964 Amarch was
tightly controlled, and that its
Purpose was to express a de-
sire for civil rights legislation.
He stated that with the realiz-
ation that the real problem lay
not in the South but in the
Northern ghetto came the realiz-
ation that the Negro could ex-
press himself politically.

The situation in the South,
predicted Rabbi Lelyveld, will
rapidly improve while the sit-
uation -in the North will become
worse. As evidence of this trend
he cited the facts that in the
last ten years the income gap
between whites and Negroes has
ri-sen from 43 per cent to 50 per
cent, and that while only 39 pe-r
cent of all white workers are
semiskilled or unskilled, 75 per
cent of all Negro wo-rkers tare,

Rabbi Lelyveld said that des-
pite efforts, the gap between
Negroes and whites is growing
larger and proposed better un-
derstanding between the Negro
and Jewish communities as a
solution to the problem. He
stated that the Negro is aware
of -the Jewish struggle for equal-
ity and what the Jew has ac-

 

Power.”

He drew an analogy between
the Jew of the Russian Pale at
the beginning of the 19th cen-
tury and the Negro of todays
Northern ghetto. He said that
both were stri.pped of their cul-

ture and were forced to look
for withheld acceptance. He re-
ferred to the central ethic in
Judaism as the “slaves in Egypt
Motif" and said that it ‘should
enable the Jew to emphasize
with and understand the Negro.

In Medical School

Grant Allows A-V Aids
Broad Use In Course

The Sarah Mellon Scaife Foundation has provided $100,000
grant to ‘help ﬁnance an experimental six-week audio-visual twtorial
course in obstetrics and gynecology at the University School of

Medicine.

Utilizing an array of teaching aids, seminars -and tutorial assis-
tance, the core program for third year medical students will intro-

duce -them to the fundamental aspects of human reproduction and

female genital disorders. Parti-
cular emphasis will be placed
on the doctor-"patient relation-
ship and its importance in help-
ing the patient to understand
human sexual =behav'ior, concep-
tion and its control through fam-
ily planning methods, and the
variety of and responsibilities of
family life.

Innovators of the course are
Dr. Ronald A. Chez, assistant
professor, and Dr. Donald Hutch-
inson, professor «and chairman
of obstetrics and gyneclogy at
the School of Medicine. They
said the experiment in clinical
specialty education is designed
to provide perspective and orien-
tation for the large amount of
factual knowledge now avail-
able, to develop effective ave-
nues for exchange of physician-
patient -infvormation, and to es-
ta‘bl.ish work and study habits
for the lifelong commitment a
physician makes toward self-ed
ucation.

To achieve these goals, the
formal material has been con-
densed into four hours of as-

signments per week. The stu-
dent is to studynthe materials
in carrels with each carrel equip-
ped with a tape recorder and ear-
phones, ﬁlm projector, graphs,
short programmed texts, ex-
cerpts from textbooks and medi-
cal journals, and tissue speci-
mens.

for Action,” Page 4)

State Democratic leaders
criticized the appropriations
policy‘as handled by the
Shafer administration in a

Pitt News interview Friday- ,

The University, along with
Penn State and Temple Univer-
sity, has been forced to borrow

several million dollars to meet _A

operating expenses because of
the legislative stalemate in Har-
risburg. .Ac_co.rdin~g to three

Democratic leaders, however, .

there is sufficient money in the
state treasury to  the
schools to meet their operating
expenses.

The interest -rate on the mon-
ey -borrowed by these universi-
ties is ﬁve «and a half per cent,
and the Democrats state that
this output wastes state funds.

House Minority fWhip K. Le-
roy Irvis (D.-Pgh.) revealed that

there is an excess of some 309

million dollars from the cigar-
ette tax available for the state-
related schools. He emphasized
that Governor Raymond Shafer
does not want to allocate the
money to the schools, however,
since it would relieve the pres-
sure the univensities are put-
ting on the legislature.

Irvis further expressed cer-
tainly that the ‘‘legislature- will
pick u.p the tab for the interest.
The University can’t be expect-
ed. 'I‘hat's a foregone conclu-
sion.”

Senate Minority Leader Er- '

nest Kline (D.-Beaver) strongly
stated that -the «gove‘rnme=n~t
could distribute approximately
$12 million to each state-related
institution. “There wouldn't have
to be any interest rates  the

Republicans weren't so stub-

born.”
House Minority Leader Her-

bert Fineman (D.-Phila.) be-

lieved that “it would be difficult
to pinpoin ” when the appropria-
tions problem would be solved.

,“We have yet to see any indica-

tion of action on the part of the
government.” He explained that
during the conference dealing‘
with the appropriations, “the
Democrats yielded all we could.
Now it’s up to the Republicans.”

When asked about a compro-
mise to pass the appropriations

bill, Kline stated that the only‘

way the Democrats will sup-
port the bill is if the Governor
cuts the budget. He commented
that the passing of the -cigarette
tax hasn’.-t retarded the move-
ment of «the bill, since the Dem-
ocrats are opposed to the tax on
the grounds that it is unconsti-
tutional.

Fineman pointed out that the

bill is being held back «because .

Governor Shafer claims insuffi-
cient funds, a claim that Demo-
crats are contesting. “Bills can't
move until there is enough mon-
ey to cover them.”

“N ame-calling” also slows the
movement of the bill, added

Fineman. “The governor is more ~

than nomially sensitive.”

Dr. A. Gonzales-Arauzo, acting chair-

As part of the University Theatre’s
program of plays, seminars, and ex-
hibits for its Renaissance season, Dr.

 Gonzalez’ seminar will anticipate the

opening of the two Lope de Vega pro-

 = ductions-——The Dog in the Manger" on

Thursday, Nov. 9, and Justice without
Revenge on Friday. The plays will run
in repertory until Dec. 2 in Stephen
Foster Memorial Auditorium.
Lope de Vega, one of the geniuses
“of the world theatre, was ‘born two
years before Shakespeare and survived
him by 19 years. During his long career
this “prodigy of nature” as Cervantes
called him, wrote by his own -somewhat
exaggerated account more than 1,500.

  plays of which about 470 have survived

Unfortunately his drama. is almost en-
tirely neglected by American producers

and imaginative range of this remark-
able playwright and poet. The Dog -in,
 Manager isua light-hearted

   
   

   
  

iews Plays

equates personal honor with public rep-
utation. The title character is a willful
Neapolitan Countess whose sense of
honor will not permit her to admit her
love for her secretary until she discov-
ers that he is in love with one of her
servants.

Her jealously awakens her desire for
him and he-r inner conﬂict between her
unwanted passion and her exaggerated
sense of honor form the basis for a
series of ingenious comic m.isunders-tand-
ings. The force behind many of the in-
trigues is the most celebrated of all the
comic servants in the Spanish drama,
the Wily Trisrtan, considered by so-me
critics to be the inspiration for Beau-
marchais’ Figaro.

The second offering, Justice without
Revenge, is again about love and honor,

but this" play treats the darker -side of A

the subject. This tragedy, based on an
Italian novella, tells the story of the
sadistic Duke of. Ferrara and the kind
of justice he administers to his -son and
his young wife when they have violated
his honor.

The story is given a curiously mod-
em "cast by Lope. Like the plays of Pir-
andella, it deals with the relationship
between gesture and reality. The Duke,
like Enrico IV, is accusrtomed to mani-
pulating the world according to his
fancy. Ironically, he ﬁnds himself a vic-
tim of his own manipulation when he

‘Doors’ Call to Hedonism ..

by PAUL -ANDERSON

A few months ago The Doors
were pleading with their molls to
set a few physical ﬁres and when
they complied, were forced to blind-
ly stagger from whiskey bar to
whiskey bar groping for an exting-
uishing concoction. Now, they seem to
realize that saloon doors can swing both
ways. They’re out in the street again
feellin-g strange and feverish.

The Doors newest album, Strange
Days (Elecktra 7401), is a sometimes
frenzied, sometimes calm call to hedon-
ism in response to an absurd life that
must “end” in a “big sleep." In when
The Music's Over vocalist Jim Morri-
son and his recalci-tranlt friends bemoan
the rape 0-f “our Sister," the earth by
wasteful modems. “Ravaged and plun-
dered,” the earth lies helpless before
these mechanical entrepreneurs. Out of
the dissonance of violation they can hear
but one “very gentle sound”; music. The
Doors tell us to “dance on ﬁre as it in-
tends” and they turn when The Music's
Over into an 11 minute fertility rock-rite.

Orgiastic musical explosions rock and
roll throughout the rest of the album.
Love Me, Two Times is an obvious dirty
ditty about a lad who is going away for
a spell and asks his lady friend to help
make parting sweeter sorrow.

The theme of People are Strange is
alienation and The Doors are strange

    

hard, to ’

en are wicked when you’re unwanted”
and ‘ﬁstreets are uneven when you’re
down.”

The Doors are up for now and their
appeal is not restricted to California
alone. Students in dormitory‘ rooms all
across the country are busy vibrating to
the erotic lyrics of their song feasts,

One of the best groups -to come out
of the West Coast sub-culture is Country
Joe and the Fish. Unike many of the pop-
ular groups their music concerned only
with expression and not commercializa-
tion. You Won’t ﬁnd Country Joe in the
top ten.

First impressions of their vangard
recording called simply Country Joe and
the Fish (VSD-79244) are often danger-
OUSI)’ misleading. Country Joe's voice is
not melodious but hauntingly, mysteri-
0U-Sly beautiful. This ﬁnny group seems
to care about what they sing.

Nothing escapes comment, not even
our good president, LBJ, who is praised
in Superbird (“send you back to Texas
make you work on your ranch”) or the
mind-expansions of pot in Bass Strings
(“Hey partner won’t you pass that reef-
er‘ ’I‘0und”). Their imagery is quite ef-
fective and future writers will ﬂnd it

Editorial: A Plea for Action

The legislative stalemate has forced the University, along with the
two other state related institutions, to borrow several million dollars in
order to meet its operating expenses. The interest rate on these loans is
five-and-a-half per cent, but this money will be eventually reimbursed to
the universities by the state, according to House Minority Whip K. Leroy
Irvis.

All of this borrowing is unnecessary, however, since the state has
sufficient fun-ds in its treasury to give each of the three state-related insti-
tutions approximately $12 million, which would meet their operating ex-
penses and erase the need for any loans. The state has this money, due to
the recently-passed cigarette tax, according to state Democratic leaders.
However, Rep. II‘VllS feels that Gov. Raymond Shafer is deliberately refus-
ing to allocate the money because he does not want to relieve the pressure
the state-related institutions are now placing on the state legislature.

Both Senate Minority Leader Ernest Kline and House Minority
Leader Herbert Fineman concur with Irvis’ statements. “There wouldn't
have to be any interest rates if the Republicans weren't so stubborn,”
Kline emphasized.

It is already November, and the legislative stalemate still exists.
Our own University has been forced to borrow money to meet its operat-
ing expenses since October 1. Another month has passed, and still no prog-

ress has been made. The name-calling continuies, but no legislation has 0

been approved. No state official even wants to venture a guess as to when
a compromise will be reached.

The failure of our state legislature to act is intolerable. Obviously,
our main concern is the funds promised the state-related institutions. If
there. is money in the state treasury to at least meet that obligation, we
cannot see why the Governor would let politics interfere with the function
of state programs.

The appropriations stalemlate -has become an endless nightmare that
seems without end. The same statements are made denouncing the same

‘ people, but there have been no concrete results, whatsoever. The Demo-

crats castigate the Governor and the reverse is true. Their outbursts could
be excused if the issue were just breaking, but the fight -has been dragging
on for months . . . and months . . . and months,

If Governor Shaferhas money in the state treasury to at least ful-
fill the state’s obligation to its state-related institutions, why doesn’t he
at least save the taxpayers the money for the interest rates that are
steadily increasing and give the three schools money to operate? As the
chief executive of our state, he should be the first one to raise above par-
tisanship and his own preferences to salvage something from the disaster
that is now occurring in our state government. We urge the Governor to
compromise his demands in the interest of the citizens of the state. We
cannot see how he can, in good conscience, allow our state government
to fall into the shambles cit is all too rapdily becoming.

 

 

 
  

Abolish ROTC

Militarism On Campus

AMERICAN COLLEGE
students and indeed many Of
their elders, have recently
begun to realize that protest
against the war in Vietnam
is in reality not just an ob-
jection to the foreign policy
of the United States, bu.t to
its internal policy as Well. It
-has become evident that the
term “-democracy” govern-
ment for and by the people.
is meaningless in contem-
porary American society.

. It is not government _for
the people when the officials

Officers Training Corps is
repugnant. Our University is
intended as an institution of
thought, not of blind obedi-
ence required in the ROTC
classes. And the departments
of our school should be en-
gaged -not in the study of
death, but in the examina-
tion of life and the ways in
which we can enrich life. To
give Military Science equal
status with the academic dis-
ciplines is to besmirch the
concept of intellectual curios-

ity.
The Students for Peace
demonstrations against

ROTC on this campus are
not intended to create an ex-
plosive situation on the Ca-
thedral lawn. Instead, they
are designed to show that
members of the University
community are no longer
content to have uniformed
and armed troops parading
on the grass of their school
two days each week. The
protests are intended to show
that while the military may
be the dominant voice in
America today, it will not be
permitted to exist at this
University without obvious,
and vocal, opposition.

Some of the protesters
feel that it is their moral
duty to disrupt the activities
of ROTC by sitting in, and
they do so knowing that
such activities may result in
suspension from the Univer-
sity. This choice is a person-
al one, and it is not for any
group, including Students
for Peace, to belittle these
peoples’ convictions.

THERE WILL be protests
on this campus as long as
ROTC is permitted to exist
here. We cannot hope to al-
ter the course of our govern-
ment and society on a na-
tional level without at the
same time working the local
area as well. If our nation is
to ever see the true fulﬁll-
ment of government for the
people, we must divorce the
military from society. The
abolition of the Reserve Of-
ﬁcers Training Corps is but
a first step.

 

 
 

Letters to

Sophs Plea For
Weekend Break

» Editor, The Pitt News:

During the fall term, the ma-
jor weekend offered to Pitt stu-
dents is Homecoming. In view
of the great number of students
that are involved in Homecom-
ing or would like to attend the
Homecoming activities, we would
like to know why professors
cannot refrain from scheduling
examinations on the Friday be-
fore or the Monday following
the weekend? Is it really asking
too mu-ch for a mid-term exam-
ination that counts for appro-
ximately 50 per cent of a course
to be postponed until the Wed-
nesday following Homecoming?
Would it really place such a_
hardship on a professor to de-
lay hi-s extarnination one class
period so that his students can
enjoy the “big” weekend and
still do well in -his mid-terms?

We realize that the purpose of
the University is not to promote
a student’-s social life, but we
don't think that making it a lit-
tle easier for a student to at-
tend Homecoming would ruin
the University's academic repu-
tation either. The dates of Home-
coming are announced ﬁar in
advance of the Fall Term. There
is no real good excuse for a
professor to give a mid-term
exam during this period.

We also ask if i-t is necessary
for a professor to give 'a choice
of the Friday ‘before or the Mon-
day after Homecoming for his
examination? 'Dha.t is like being
told you «are going to be exe-
cuted, and then asked if you
would prefer to be hanged or
electrocuted. It doesn’t really
matter, you're going -to die any.
way. It seems hardly necessary
that some professors or instruc-
tors of this University should
curtail a student's participation
in Homecoming or decrease his
chances of a fair mid-term grade
due to the professor's own lack
of insight or hi-s contemptible
inconsideration in scheduling ex.
aminations.

Student Adds
To NCNP Story

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is remarkable and outrage-
ous “One of America's Great
Student Newspapers” should, in
the reporting of a public politi-
cal discussion, fail to give an
account of the talk of one of the
principle speakers. I refer to the
article on the Liberal Forum’s
discussion of the National Con-
ference for New Politics (NCNP)
which appeared on page 11 of
-th-e October 27, 1967, issue.

While no one -can actually
speak for Mr. Harris save Mr.
Harris himself, it does seem ap-
propriate that ‘his remarks be
-avai-laibl-e to student readers,
even if there is «some aniisk of
distortion.

First, Mr. Harris maintained
that it is foolish for two -groups
as weak as militant Negro and
white liberals to try to form a
political coalition at this time.
Furthermore, neither group
seems to recognize the interests
of the other as legitimate, and
this is a necessary pre-condition
of coalition formation. For these
reasons, Mr. Harris seems to be-
lieve that the primary motiva-
ti-on-s of the delegates to the
N CN P were extra-political.

Second, Mr. Harris emphasized
what -he termed “in-.stitutional
racism” in the United States. He
claimed that American life is
permeated w'i.t'h deeply embed-
ded racial revsentmentls and
hatreds and that they infect
what rni-ght appear as ordinary
activities. He cited as examples
the facts that the good guys
wear white hats while bad guys
wear black hats and that black
cars stop -before white cars in
TV rendition of gasoline mile-
age tests.

Third, Mr. Harris recommend-
ed the organization of separate
bases of power along raciall lines.
He maintained , that Negroes
should not at this time be tight-
ing for seats in integrated
schools and -so forth, but rather
should be concentrating -on com-
munity organization in Negro
areas.

An exhibition of British
taste in fashion, fun, craft
and artistry is being pre-
sented at Gimbels in Pitts-
burgh this week. “Great
Great Britain” is sponsored
by Gimbels in cooperation
with Her Majesty’s British.
Board of Trade and the Bri-
tish Consulate-General’.

The exclu-sive import fair at-
temps to give Pittsburghers a
touch of Britain in total atmos-
phere. World renowned British

subjects have been invited to the

fair and the.city is presenting a
hearty welcome.

Mayor Barr opened “Great
Great Britain” at a ribbon cut-
ting ceremony last Monday. Fri-
day evening a gala Ambassa-
dor's Ball was sponsored by the
Twenty-ﬁve Club to honor the
visit to Pittsburgh of Great Bri-
tain’s ambassador to the United
States, Hi-s Excellency Sir Pat-
rick Dean, G.C.M.G., and Lady
Dean. The Ball was for the bene-
ﬁt of Infant Research at Magee
Womens Hospital.

Clive, the youngest member of
the Incorporated Society of Lon-
don Fashion Designers, present-
ed the new Clive Set Ready-to
Wear Collection at the Ball. The
34-year-old couturier from Lon-
don is well known for his de-
signs for such personalities as
Princess Lee Radziwell, Diane
Cilento, Cyd Charisse and Suzan-
nah York.

A special preview of the mo
vie, Camelot, will be held Wed-
nesday at the Squirrel Hill The-
ater to beneﬁt the Women's
American ORT, Pittsburgh Re-
gion. Commander Edward C.
Whitehead, president of Schwep-
pes (USA), Will make a guest
appearance. Commander White-
head took charge of the ﬁrst
Schweppes American franchise
operation in 1953.

By importing only the essence,
adding water treated to Schwep-
pes exacting specifications plus
the “Schweppervescence,” Com-
mander Whitehead reduced the
retail price of Schweppes tonic
from 60 cents to 16 cents a bolt-
tle. The Commander re1u.ct-antly
and unexpectedly appeared in
his company's opening adver-
tisement and has become a out-
standing advertising agent.

The Gimbels building on Sixth
and Smithﬁeld is draped with a.
multi-sized British ﬂag. Sitting
in front of the building or driv-
ing around the Golden Triangle

, is an imported, double-decked,

bright red British bus. Free bus
tickets can be obtained at Gim-
bels.

Gimbels has also invited a
colorful list of personalities and
demonstrators to the Downtown
store.

Alﬁe Howard, champion -town

FRANK GUSTINE SCRAMBLES to avoid Syracuse rushers as
Greg Ellis (71) looks on. Gustine, who according to Dave Hart had
a “hot hand” was forced to leave the game with a shoulder injury.

 
 

by MIKE BROURMAN

Ed Mantie spoiled a dream.
With seven minutes left in
Saturday’s game, the Syra-
cuse defensive back returned a
punt 53 yards for the Winning
TD and, in the process, broke
the hearts of a gallant band of
Panthers.

Up until that fateful moment,
it looked as if the underdog Jun-
gle Cats were about to spring a
major upset. But, Mantie’s re-
turn gave the Orange a 14-7 vie
tory as, for the second week in
a row, the Panthers saw their
hopes crumble in the last ﬂeet-
ing minutes of play.

For almost 53 minutes -the in-
spired Panthers looked like win-
ners. They had stopped Larry
Csonka. They had overcome
their own mistakes. They had
even managed to overcome a
poor kicking game, to hold a
hard-earned 7-6 lead.

Then Mantie broke down the
left sideline. ,

“I thought we had the cover-
age,” said a disappointed Dave
Hart. “We had two_peop{1e to
the outside, but they both got
knocked down and didn’t get
back up fast enoug .”

Hart was ‘visibly shaken by
the defeat. He was not .as stun-
ned as after the pounding by
Miami two weeks ago, o-r as
emotionally drained as after the
heartbreaker against Navy last
week. Still, defe-at’s -a hard thing
to take, especially after leading
so much of the way.

“Last week we played a good
game,” he said, “but I think this
one was better. I’m really proud
of the boys for playing two such
games together.” ,

Hart especially lauded his de-
fense, which held the vtasunted

Punt Reur Drops   Unluc

 Undaunted By All-American,

Yajko Helps Contain Csonka

by ROY JACOBS

Up until Saturday’s game
with Syracuse, Larry Cson-
ka was just -a name in a
press clipping to Gene Yajko.
Yajko was a sophomore, and he

- hadn't even seen the Orange All-

American candidate, much less
play against him. About all he
could -do was believe what he
read and heard.

After going heads-up against
Csonka, Yajko, the Panther mid-
dle linebacked, didn’t believe in
.'the clippings anymore.

“_I didn’t think too much of
‘him, compared to what we had
heard.” said Gene. “Maybe he's
too built up. Maybe he just had
a bad day. He didn’t impress me
——I don't think he impressed
any of us.”

Csonka, churning through the
line, has been described as “a
gorilla shoveling snow,” but Yaj-
ko, Dave Drake, Mike Mancuso
and the others virtually made a
monkey out of him.

“He didn’t have the holes to
reviewed Gene.
“Our defensive line Wasn't let-
ting his blockers block, letting
our linebackers get to him.” For

«the record Csonka did gain 72

yards on 24 carries, but far be-
low his average of 4.4 prior to
the game.

“I thought he would gain m-ore
yardage than he did,” Yajko re-
ﬂeoted. “He's supposed to be the
best «in the country. He was the
main threat, but once we stop-
ped him, we pretty much stop-
ped them.”
till, the Panthers ended up

lier, and Gene shouldered most
of the blame for that one. I

“(Rick) Cassata rolled out.
Csonka was blocking and I was
on him, but he moved out,” ex-
plained Yajko. “I thought Cas-
sata was over the line and was
going to run. I moved up and
he tossed it over me to Csonka
who scored.”

Later the Panthers» took the
lead; -buy, as against Navy

‘too.

  

they were destined to lose. And
Gene, not on the punt team,
was just watching.

“I couldn't believe that punt
return. If it wasn’t for that I
think we could've held them,”
Gene remorscd. “It was sort of
heartbreaking. I was standing
on the sideline and he (Ed Man-
tle) ran right by him. I want-
ed to tackle him.”

But he coul-dn’t. Heartbreaks

ED GALLIN CLOSES in on Larry Csonka and belts rthe A11-Amer.
ica fullback down after a short gain. Gallin and Gene Yajko, the
middle linebacker, were in on 28 tackles, most of them on Csonka.

Csonka to 72 yards in 24 car-
ries. “What we did was similar
to what Navy did against them,”
he noted. The Panthers scrapped
their 4-3 defense for a 5-3 to
combat Csonka. “We had our
linebackens stacked,” he added,
“so that it amounted to «an eight
man front.”

The «Panthers biggest defen-
sive stand occured when they
were pinned deep in their own
territory with less than two
minutes left in there scoreless
ﬁrst half. The Orange had the
ball fourth and inches at the
Cat four yard line when Csonka
was stopped cold by linebackers
Gene Jajko and Ed Gralllin. They
were «lined up -opposite Csonka
all day and made 28 tackles be-
tween them.

“I thought after we stopped
them down there, we had the
momentum,” Hart commented.
But Symcuse was back in busi-
ness moments later after a poor
punt by Bill Zurzolo, pressed into
duty because of an injury to
George Medich. 1

Working fnom the 32 yard
line with 59 seconds left, quar-
terback Rick Cassata hit end
Dennis Kleinback for 13, then
ﬁred la 19 yard scoring strike to
Csonka, who actnaily was a big-
ger threat as a receiver than a
runner, -grabbing .ﬁ_ve passes.

“They had us in a bind,” Hart
revealed. “With our eight-man
front, and with us shooting the
gaps, they really had the ﬂat
areas open.”

Still, the Panthers came back.
On the ﬁrst scrimmage play of
the second half they blasted

‘ Csonka, shaking him loose from

the ball. Bob Ellis recovered for
the Cats at the Orange 32. Five
plays later, Joe McCain swept
left end on a pitchout for the
score. McCain’s extra point gave
the Panthers a lead they held
until that late dash by Mantle.

Even with Mantie’s return,
Hart‘ had expressed conﬁdence.
“I though we’d score again. I
was so conﬁdent, I was talking
about our two-point play.” But
Frankie Gustine, who had dis-
played a hot hand art quarter-
back,‘ had hurt his -shoulder and
Jeff Barr couldn't get the of-
fense moving again.

Thus, for the second week in
a row the Panthers were frus-
trated. Some have said that it's
better to lose 58-O than to lose
heartbreakers. Dave Hart has
lost both ways, and he disagrees.
“After these ‘two games we can
hold our heads up again.

Hawks Crush Owls, 20-8;
Lies Romps for Three TD’s

by TEX MAWL

The worst feeling in the world is to have a cherished dream ‘

shattered. Knowing this, and not wanting to disappoint their fans,
the Pitt News Hawks stcamrolled to a 28-0 victory over the Owl

Owls yesterday.

In a last minute change of
strategy, Hlawk coach Jay “Flat-
bush” Roscnstein minimized his
playing time and concentraxted
on directing his team from the
bench. He later conﬁded he was
recovering from .a Sunday morn-
ing hangover.

The themes were many, and not
the least of these was George
Lies. “Moust'achio” scored -all
three touchdowns on sweeps of
eight and 41 yards and on a 75
yard kickoff return. The ﬁrst
touchdown was set up by an 63
yard kickoff return by Dan
“Hands” Lichrtenstein, who was
caught from behind at the eight
when he stopped momentarily

“I didn’t know what to do,”
said Dan. “You might say I was
buffalloed.”

Fortunately for the Hawks,
the defense took the game more
seriously than the olfense. Once
again the team’s aging name-
sake, Mike “Hawk” Brourman,
called on his rapidly failing mid-
dle linebacker’s legs to break
up every pass fired in his direc-
tion. I

“If I'd only learn to use my
hands,” said the Hawk, “I might
even come up with some inter-
ceptions.” Hawks was comfort-

A TALE OF TWO COACHES

An acute observer at the Varsity Lettermen’s banquet
Friday night could get at least three insights into the fu-
ture of athletics at Pitt.

1) Chancellor Wesley Posvar addressed the gathering.
The Pitt News will report and comment on what the Chan-
cellor said, in Wednesday’s issue.

2) Coach Dave Hart’s brash, yet sincere remarks,
showed why he ris a great recruiter and why he just might
do what some people feel he can’t accomplish, i.e. rebuild
Pitt football.

3) Athletic Director Frank Carver introduced new
wrestling coach Dave Adams and new swimming coach Bill
Grant. Track coach Jim Banner wasn’t introduced, but he
didn’t have to be. The acute observer egither knew, or had
been told -about the job Banner was doing with Pitt track.

BANNER’S VARSITY cross country team finished its
"dual meet season with a 5-3 record; a modest mark, but
when you consider the state of the other fall sports and

‘ take into account a five msan squad, Banner’s achievements

as a coach border on mythology. .

And because of his recruiting and coaching, the fresh-
man cross country team breezed through its schedule. Led
by Jerry Rlichey, who Banner says has never yet been
pushed, the frosh have a solid chance at the IC4A cham-
pionship. The IC4A’s are usually dominated by traditionally
powerful Villanova, but in Richey, Banner feels he has an-
other Jim Ryan, someone who will be under four minutes in
the mile by this summer.

BANNER IS A COACH who knows what it is to win.
Hart is a coach who has experienced the sweetness of vic-
tory, but not here.

In his remarks at the banquet, Hart chided himself

- and the alumni for being quick to find things Wrong with

Bitt’s football program. He asked everyone instead to praise
the  that make u'{p-the 1967 Panthers.

“Our kids are suffering where it hurts the most,” Hart
said. “Inside. I’d rather have the blood from a bruise than
suffe-r the heartache from a loss.”

BUT THESE KIDS come back Monday after Monday,
Tuesday after Tuesday,” and Hart was emotional by then,
“it’s certainly not easy for them.”

Lately they’ve been coming back Saturday after Satur-
day and no one gave them a bigger compliment than Syra-
cuse coach Ben Schwartzwalder. “If Notre Dame comes here
expecting a walkover,” he said after Saturday's game, “Pitt
could give them a lot of trouble.”

Schwartzwalder complimented the Panther defense for

its aggressiveness and its strategy. A physically drained

Larry Csonka put it simply. “They hit as hard as Penn
State,” he said. “We couldn’t do too much of anything good
against them.”

shut out by State, 15-45, they
closed the year with a 53 slate.
The freshmen remained unbeat-
en and closed with a perfect 7-0
record.

Coach Banner’s varsity team
was throu-gh-ly beaten by ' a
strong Nittany Lion sq-uad. State
captured the ﬁrst six spots, with
captain A1 Schaeifer covering
the ﬁve mile course in a Winning

‘ time of 25 minutes 48 -seconds.

The highest ﬁni-sh by the har-
niers was seventh place by Paul
Greig. ~

Speaking about the Lions, Ban-
ner said, “They are always one
of the better teams in the East,
and this squad is one of the best
that Penn State has had in re-
cent years.”

Of his own team, Banner was

Booters Lose To Akron, 2-0

by DAVE TIERNAN

Once again the failure to
score caused defeat for the
booters as they lost to_Ak-
ron U. Saturday, by a score
of 2-0.

The defense played another
strong game, holding the Akron
forwards, who had scored 34
goals in previous games, score-
less until the last ten minutes of
the game. Akron’s ﬁrst goal
cam-e on a header by James
Malcolm, a two-time Junior Col-
lege All American, and it was
his 13th goal of the season.

It was apparent to the team
that Malcolm was oﬁ:'=side be-
fore he scored. The entire game
was marred by the inconsistency
of the referees. They awarded
Akron a penalty kick moments
after Malcolm's -goal when goalie
Len Harmon was called for
charging. The kick was good
and the 2-0 score stood.

Harmon called the game, which

Sutherland, Palace
In Dorm Semifinals

Lambda Sig Edges
Theta Chi, 13-12

. Two teams grabbed spots in tomorrow's Dorm
Football League semi-ﬁnals last Thursday and
Friday. Sutherland I-I-ouse -swamped Mad House,
25-0, to move into the League “B” semiﬁnal. and
Pleasure Palace beat Randon, 21-12, tomove into
the “League “A” sem.iﬁnals.

Random opened ﬁre in the ﬁrsrt quarter when
Steve Cundra threw a touchdown pass to Marv
Bregman. Pleasure Palace retaliated when Mike
Tully took a 35-yard pass from Cliff Brown and
scored later in the s-ame pe-riod.

After taking an 8-6 lead on a safety in the
second period, Pleasure Palace s-cored in the
third quarter when Brown ran the ball over from,
the one-yard line. A 25-yard pass from Brown to
Dick Leggatt completed the Placemen’s assault.

With Sutherland ahead, 6-0, Sam Colossema
intercepted a pass by Mad House quarterback
Bill Hull and ran for a touchdown. He repeated.
this performance in the third period, with a
conversion pass to Herb Kosstrin making the
score 19-0. A 30-yard pass from Don Lombardo
to Ron Neccial in the same period closed the
scoring.

Pleasure Palace, which has three Wins and

one loss, will play unbeaten Stratford 

     

Rain lightened Thursday's fraternity touch
football play as a two-game schedule was sliced
in half. A game between Delta Sigma Phi and
Pi Lambda Phi was postponed. The League “A”
game will be played today.

A League “B” contest saw Theta Chi go down
to its second defeat, losing to Lambda Sigma
Rho, 13-12.

Lambda Sig opened the scoring with the only.
first half touchdown on a 10-yard pass from Jim
Piper to Stan Nippes. The extra point that even-
tually mean-t the -game was gained on a pass
from Piper -to Phil Laura, and Lambda Sig took
a 7-0 lead into the second half. 6

This margin was increased to 13-0 early in
the second half on a TD aerial from Piper to
Mike Lauro. "

Theta Chi didn’t give up easily. They fouglht
hard and just fell short. A TD pass of 15 yards
from Warren Nystrum to Dave Hauck lessened
the margin to 13-6, and a 10-yard toss from Ny-
strum to Mike Zemaitus -cut the lead to one point.
With an unsuccessful conversion attempt, Theta
Chi suffered the defeat that meant elimination
from the “B" chase.

upset by their performance and
all he could say wa-s, “It was
their last meet of the season,
and I'll just let it go at that.”

Wihereas the varsity perform-
ance was well below this sea-
son's standards, the freshman
team performed in their typical
impressive manner and defeat-
ed the Penn State frosh, 21-34,
although the Young Lions were
the first team to score upon the
freshmen this season in a dual
meet.

Led by a record-breaking per-
formance by undefeated Jerry
Richey, the frosh captured spots
one, two and ﬁve through sev-
en. Richey broke the three mile
State course record by nine sec-
onds and set a new one of 14
minutes and 56.4 seconds.

“Raichey ran a tremendous
race,” said Banner. “It was a
real over-all team effort that
gained the win. The kids really
pulled together.”

Greg Rodgers, who has been
consistently running right be-
hind Richey in the number two
spot, again ﬁnished second. His

was dominated by the booters
until the ﬁnal ten minutes, “the
poorest officiated game in which
he ever played.”

Although the booters control-
ed the ball in the ﬂ-rst three
quarters and had more shots on
goal than Akron, the shots
weren't good and the booters
suffered their sixth setback of
the season. Dave S-himpeno, Bob
Trexler and Pete Snyder all had
an opportunity to score, but two
of the shots «barely missed the
net, and Sh»imIpeno’s header spun
around the post and out of the
net.

Despite the loss, coach Leo
Bemxi-s credited the team with
an excellent effort. “We’1l win
the next two,” said Bemis, “the
players feel so, too.”

He noted that the sophomores
have gained valuable experience,
and that halfback Bob Quinlin
played his best game of the
year.

After a strong comeback ef-
fort, which resulted in goals by
Randy Drye and Dave Dimedio,
fell short, the freshman soccer
team lost, 3-2, in ;a preliminary
contest.

It was a good showing against
the Akron junior varsity, which
has won nine and lost none in
previous ‘games. Akron scored
two goals in the early minutes
of the game, and needed a goal
in the closing minutes to win

time was 15:34. Banner said that
Richey and Rodgers, the “R and
R boys,” ran most of this and
other meets together, which
benefits both of them in their

gperformaance. Of Rodgers him-

self, Banner said, “-Greg is one
of the most improved runners

on the team. .He is the key to I

our success.” ‘

Third and fourth place were
taken by Mike Schurko and‘
Tom Kissell of Penn State. Ac-
cording to Banner, Shurko was
supposed to be “one of the top.
boys in the East,” but Richey
and Rodgers beat him by 44 and
16 seconds, respectively.
