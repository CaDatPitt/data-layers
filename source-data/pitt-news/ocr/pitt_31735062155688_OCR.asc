Toastmaster of the dinner, Ross"

Reese, who was program co-or-
dinator for last year’s Religion-in-
Life week, introduced Paul
Schrading, this year’s chairman.
Schrading outlined the pur-
poses of Religion-in-Life- First-
mentioned goal was the height-
ening of awareness of spiritual
values, both personally and in
group life. Next, in connection
with the theme, “I Confront a
Changing World,” Schrading
said, “Changes in the world af-
fect our own lives. Spiritual
values will help us look at and
accept these changes in their
proper perspective.”

“Religion is vital,” said‘Schrad—

- ing. “It’s part of us.” During Re-

ligion-in—Life Week, students
should make any extra effort to
understand their own religious
heritages and those of others, he
stressed. The" February confer-
ence should also help to develop
and encourage individual church
loyalties.

A Finally, during the week ofcon-
ferences, lectures and discussions,
students will have a chance to
hear outstanding leaders in the re-
ligious ﬁeld. Convocation speaker,
Solomon B. Freehof, for
example, has just returned from
a tour of Israel. “He has seen
how the world changes,” said
Schrading.

General Purpose of the con-
ference expressed was that “we
believe, and devote the few days
of Religion-in—Life week to.,

still be accounted for. .

Wallace said that people from
the Slav countries have contrib-
uted considerably to the cultural
and economic life of this country.

“Census ﬁgures show that six
ane one-half per cent of the total
populationof the United‘ States is
made up of people who themselves
or whose-fathers or mothers have
come from the Slav countries! Al-
legheny County has an even higher

proportion with 17 out of every
100 residents coming from Slavonic
nationalities,” Wallace said.
Wallace, a native of Scotland, is
a graduate of the University of
Glasgow ‘and the School of Sla-
vonic and East European "Studies

opinions they would suffer “hardening of the mental ar-

listen, perhaps we,sha\l1 ﬁnd it diﬁicult discovering teachers
other than those provided by our school.

But at college we are each —other’s teachers. Nowhere

Doesn't Like Virginia

EDITOR,
PITT NEVV S:

« The weather was not the only
obnoxious part of the Virginia
trip. It took us twelve and a half
hours to drive down. What a
grind! The campus was, as you
say, beautiful. The old Southern
architecture was beautiful. But
there the.pleasant effects stop.
’Ask the football team about
“Southern Hospitality.” With‘ a
bigoted attitude typical of the
South, the Virginia team started

' picking on certain members of

the Pitt team. Because these
“Southern gentlemen”
they were members of a superior
race, they concentrated more on
slugging, twisting' arms, and
pushing faces in the mud, espe-
cially with respect to two mem-

bers of the Pitt backﬁeld, than,

in winning the game. The South-

erners (the Sou—uth will rise ,.

again, suh) were astonished that
the Pitt team got mad. Result:
injuries. A - '

Lest anyone think it was just
the UV football team that was
bigoted, let us look at the school
itself. Apologies, Mr. Editor, but
the University of Virginia is co-
educational. It has about’ 3,500
men and about 300 girls. It is a
state university, but it has pri-
vate entrance qualiﬁcations. The
state says it must admit girls, but
the boys vwon’t speak to 7them.
They (the boys) want the U of V
to be a schodl strictly for “South-
ern gentlemen.” (And there are
some of those in the North, too.)

Oxford Professor Stops at Pitt

T P     t St d ' E l d

By JIM DeVVEESE 6
and

ED FRANK

A sample of England in general and Oxford in particular

. stopped at Pitt for a brief chat last Wednesday in the person

of Dr. D. J. Wenden, professor of modern European history
and modern German history at Oxford University.

Purpose of Dr. Wenden’s visit was to promote study at

British Isles which oﬁer summer

courses. .

This summer, Oxford otters
studies in literature and politics
of the 20th century, while Edin-
boro affords a course of study in
modern Western civilization with
regard to the growth ofliterature
or the development of political
ideas.

London Ideal Location

The ﬁeld‘of' study at London in-

‘eludes literature, art, and music

during the 17th and 18th centur-
ies. London is ideally suited for
these courses since all the the-
aters, churches and historic build-

S ings of the city itself serve as

perhaps the largest laboratory in
the world for the stude-nts.

Birmingh-am, located at Strat—'
ford-on-Avon, willbffer courses
of study on Shakespeare. The
Shakespeare Institute will serve
as a backdrop for the stud.y of the
immortal bard.

Dr. Wendon e-ntered Oxforduini

1941 intending to receive a de-
gree. The war intervened, how-

-ever, and he spent ﬁve years in

the army. He received his degree
in 1947 and is now touring the
United States and visiting all ma-
jor colleges and universities.-

Dr. Wendon is acting represen-

tative oi’ the Institute of Interna- _

tional~Relations. The ‘Institute has
arranged "with the Cunard Lines
for student transportation to and
from England at special rates. '
Informal Contacts Among Students
The curriculum of study at
these institutions includes the pro-
motion of informal contacts among
students through dances,‘ recep-
tions, and ﬁeld trips. Saturday

7 and Sunday are free from study
and the student may avail himself _

of the trips arranged by the In-

stitution at which he is studying, Y

or use the time. in ways of his

‘ own choosing. Weekends are en-

tirely his own. .
A program of 65 lectures is

scheduled featuring scholars from _

all over the world, men who are
leaders in their fields. Twice each

"week," small groups will meet with

tutors to discuss that phase of the
lectures which is most important
to ‘them. ,

In addition to lectures and dis-
cussion groups, r_egular1y planned
expeditions will attend plays and
travel to various points of interest
to their respecive ﬁelds. Lecturers

' usually hold informal discussions-'

over a cup of colffee (or tea), In

students may question points

At Stadium

Underdog

Tomorrow

MAZER.

Returning home after four weeks on the road, Red
Dawson’s Panthers hope to feast on another Southern dish
tomorrow afternoon when North Carolina State visits Pitt
Stadium for the second straight year.

- Coached by Beaver Falls native:
Horace Hendrickson ,the Wolfpack
will be a four-touchdown under-
dog ‘to the_ homecoming Panthers
whocwhipped them, 48-6, last fall.

It will be the second consecu-
tive Dixie battle for Dawson’s per-
sonnel as last week they pushed
over, Virginia. Tomorrow's 1:30
starting time, though. will not ﬁnd
Dawson as sure as he was against
the Cavaliers.

Bigger Than Virginia

“They’re at least three touch-
downs better than Virginia” an-
swers the Redhead. The basis for
his opinion is that the Wolfpack
has been improving of late and
their team is much bigger than
the Virginians.

Against Army, State lost out in
the ﬁnal two quarters after a ﬁne
ﬁrst half and the week before they
bowed by just one point to Wil-
liam and Mary.

As usual, the Panthers will not
have their regular starting lineup
intact because of injuries. The bul-
wark right side of the —line, namely
end Dick Deitrick and tackle Eld-
red Kraemer, will be missing to-

morrow for the ﬁrst time this
season.

. Three New Starters

Kraemer is out for the year with
a dislocated shoulder and Deitrick,
who might_break into"the lineup
if the game is close, is still'recov-
ering from a slight concussion and
will probably be rested for next
week’s tough Penn State game.

Tackle Howie Linn from Steu-
benville and end John Paluck from

- Swoyersville, both sophs, will take

over for the two injured linemen
and second-year man Dick Manson
from'Franklin moves into the left
halfback post after his ground
gaining display at Charlottesville.

__Guard Paul Blanda,  his knee
holds up, will attempt to break the
points after touchdown record of
44 set by Nick Bolkovac in 1948-
50. The Youngwood junior has al-
ready tied the mark in only two
seasons. ‘

North Carolina State’s Split-T
offense is quarterbacked by Ed-
die West, a 6-3, 190-pounder who
is rated a good passer, but his suc-
cess hasn’t been too good since his
receivers have had a hard, time

Reflecting upon our visit to the University of Virginia
last weekend, I could not help but question the thinking
of students who condemn the city atmosphere here at Pitt
and pine for the romantic and rustic quietude of a more

isolated campus life.

Aside from the social life on the campus itself, which
,may be suﬁicient, for all I know, the adjoining town of
Charlottesvilleoffers little more in the way of off-hours
life than it did when Tom J eﬁerson first set up housekeeping

at nearby Monticello.

Life in Country

Dy RUSS F RANKE
Sports Editor

~ Those of us who are accustomed to selecting our
entertainment "from dozens of sources—movies, big time
baseball, -football and other sports, dances and shows with
name entertainers, or attractive grog emporiums--would
probably ﬁnd it diﬁicult getting accustomed to the se-
clusion of comparatively rural schools. More difficult, at
_least, than the idealists would have us believe.

I .don’t say that we should’ select our school purely for
the convenience of the fast life_—getting an education is
the prime, consideration. A sincere student will get along
in spite of the quality of-the football team or the appeal
