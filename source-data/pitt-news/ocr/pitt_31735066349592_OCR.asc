‘ii-faculty Votes To Oust Nyden PPU Will Face Runoff     I
  WithoutAAUP Support .

BY BILL MOORE

Senior sociology department
faculty voted, 14-1 with one
abstention Friday not to renew the
contract-'of assistant professor Paul
Nyden following a 90-minute
hearing in which the controversial
young professor received praise
from nationally respected scholars.

Nyden, 30, said yesterday he was
shocked at the number of his
iggsociates who had voted against

‘.~..__.§-‘.1’. “I don’t know what kind of

pressure has been put on them,”
he said.

The faculty vote, which followed
a six-hour, closed-door meeting,
supported an earlier recommenda-
tion by a six-member department
steering committee. Nyden, known
for his support of Marxist causes,
has asked that a report prepared in
conjunction with that recommenda-
tion be released, but sociology
department chairman Burkart
Holzner has stood ﬁrm in his
refusal to release the 15-page

, ment.

" "I am dismayed at the vote, but I
am also still convinced I will
ultimately win this,” Nyden said.
“There have been too many errors
of procedures, too many violations
of civil rights.” ‘

Nyden said he would take the
issue to court if he is unsuccessful
in overturning the recommendation
at the university level. “I hope to
win here, but I am perfectly willing
to go to court with it," he said.

He still believes the non-renewal
is due to his political beliefs rather
than academic performance, and
 yesterday the senior faculty

Assistant sociology professor Paul Nyden said he was shocked at the
number of his associates who voted against renewing his contract.

apparently had not _paid attention
at the open hearing.

Holzner had said’ earlier that
politics played no part in the
decision and that it was based on
Nyden’s development as a scholar.

Several sociology students and’
many of Nyden’s fellow instructors
delivered emotional statements at
Friday's open hearing.

Also speaking strongly in sup-
port of Nyden was Dr. Richard A.
Cloward, a Columbia University
sociologist who served as a
member of Nyden’s dissertation
committee at the New York school.

Cloward claimed Nyden’s disser-
tation on the growth of reform
movements in the United Mine
Workers Union was an excellent
scholarly work. ‘‘In my judgement,

General Studies Center
In North Hills Delayed

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

Objections from LaRoche College
have temporarily halted Pitt plans
for a General Studies center in the
North Hills. *

The LaRoche administration

ﬁars competition in the North Hills
 ould draw prospective students

from LaRoche, a small private
college, to Pitt, according to Pitt
School of General Studies Dean
Steele Gow.

Meetings have been scheduled
between LaRoche president Sister

Joan Coultas and Pitt Chancellor

Wesley Posvar in an attempt to iron
out the differences.

The North Hills School of

General Studies is scheduled to
open next fall. But, according to
Gow. neither a deﬁnite location nor
class offerings have been decided.
“If this is still locked up in
ggotiations between Pitt and

LaRoche in J.uly..though,” said
«.j1W.e.’-11.h,a.v.e. .t°.~°anc.¢1 .th9}f.a!l «.

opening. There’s no way we could
find a suitable location and set up
classes in that amount of time.”

A January 13 Pitt Board 'of
Trustees meeting passed a resolu-
tion recommending the go-ahead
on a North Hills operation for the
School of General Studies. But,
under Chapter 34 of a state
education law, Pitt must announce
the decision to neighboring institu-
tions affected by the expansion and
settle disagreements regarding the
site and purpose of the expansion.
Approval from LaRoche must be
obtained before the center can
open.

“Pitt, of course, has General
Studies centers in the South and
East Hills," said Gow. “But we
have nothing north of the Alle-
gheny and Ohio rivers. We think

— it’s important we have operations

on the north side for people unable
to benefit from our other_ cam-

I it was simply extraordinary,” he

said.

He told Holzner and the other
faculty mevrﬂnbers present that the
committee reviewing Nyden’s dis-
sertation had bypassed the normal
two-hour questioning of the author
and had instead advised Nyden on
how to have the work published.

Cloward_ carried letters from
prominent sociologist Herbert
Gans, also of Columbia, and
Brooklyn College political scientist
Frances Fox Piven. Both scholars
praised Nyden’s work at Columbia.

“Nyden’s dissertation was a
comprehensive combination of
sociological and sociological-histor-
ical analyses dealing with impor-
tant phenomena and issues that are

to rarely studied by sociologists,”
Gans' letter stated.

Gans further wrote that he had
heard on the “sociological grape-
vine”

on objections to his -political
attitudes, and activities. in the
community. “Needless to say, the
grapevine is not always correct,
‘and I hope that this is the case in
the present situation,” he wrote.

Monday, March 22, 1976 A-

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) de-
cided Friday to withhold official
support for the Pitt Profession
Union (PPU) in the faculty union
runoff elections slated for the end
of this month.

The vote, taken by the executive
and advisory bodies of the AAUP
said support for the PPU would be
“premature” at this time, and the

AAUP would wait until- after the <

election before taking action in
joining the PPU and the Pennsyl-
vania State Education Association
(PSEA) in a collective_bargaining
“troika.” ' —

“It was decided that joining any
coalition right now would be too
premature,” said AAUP president
Seth Spaulding, “Besides encour-
aging our members to vote, we will
take no officials stand n the
-upcoming elections.” » A p 1

“The AAUP membership is
divided on the question of
collective bargaining, so it was felt
we should wait and see what the
faculty decide at the polls on March
30 and 31.”

“Of course, we have no control

.of how our individual members will ,

vote in that election,” Spaulding
added. / e '

In reaction to the AAUP
statement, PPU president Van
Beck Hall_said his organization will
carry the campaign to the
individual members of the AAUP
and stated he was fairly pleased by
the AAUP stand.

“We would have to go to the
individual faculty. members any-
way, no matter what the AAUP’s
official stand had been,” Hall said.

“At any rate, the AAUP is so
divided over the issue of collective
bargaining that it would be difficult
to say if an official endorsement
would actually mean anything.
They were only able to carry about
68% of their membership in the
last election,” Hall added.

Rolls To Rise Until I980

BY BRUCE WALDHOLTZ

 Pitt’s overall enrollment will

‘5

‘increase until 1980, stabilize‘ for "

one or two years and then _,fall
drastically, according to Director of
Institutional Research, Marilyn

, Brown.

The rise in Pitt’s enrollment will
follow the national trend of
state-aided universities gaining
students while the more expensive
private universities decline in
enrollment.

According to Brown, 1976-77 will
be the last school year in which
increased enrollment from 1977 to
1980 will be due to students turning

./fwbm private to public institutions
"...{d from the growing trend in favor

of part-time education.
The projected fall in enrollment,
Brown said, is based on a

“declining birth rate and a growing
disenchantment with higher edu-
cation, because people graduate
-fr5m college and are unable to get
jobs or ﬁnd themselves in jobs not
requiring a degree."

The projections are based on
past and current trends and may be
inaccurate because enrollment is
affected by outside factors, she
said.

The 1975 fall enrollment for all
schools at Pitt showed a 5%
increase over that of 1974.

* Engineering showed an increase of

25% and the School of General
Studies had an increase of 9%.
CAS declined enrollment by 2%.
The increase in engineering
enrollment, according to Brown, is
due to a growth program under-

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

  Two Better Than (One

“It is the concensus of SGB that via SCATH we cannot fulﬁll our
goals and aims to prevent or  a tuition hike,” Student
Govemment Board President Barry Weisband said, thus ending the
tense relationship that had existed between the two organizations.

This is an unfortunate, and sad, turn of events.

Both SGB and

SCATH have the same goal: to ﬁght the increasing cost of tuition at
the University of Pittsburgh; and both groups admit the need for an
organized and uniﬁed student coalition to accomplish this goal.

I It would be pointless to comment on the wisdom of SGB’s decision to
withdraw support of SCATH; what’s done is done. We do, however,
hope that the forty or so Greeks who played a key role in Thursday’s

SCATH meeting will be there when the Board needs some helping
hands. Ifonly half of these forty Greeks stay involved in the dispute,
we have a ﬁghting chance at stopping, or keeping to a minimum, any
tuition hike.

. We also hope that although SGB and SCATH are no longer working

together, they will not devote their energies to ﬁghting each other

,. instead of rising tuition. It isobvious that in the future both groups will

have to ‘work harder to overcome the negative repercussions of the
split. .

In any case, the dispute between these groups has alienated
already apathetic student body—a student body that should have been
motivated to work against the tuition hikes.

The SCATH and SGB differences revolve around the direction of
-where to aimtheir anti-tuition attacks and what shape the battle should
take. Untilstudentsdeterminewhichmethodisbest, atwopronged
attack might not be such a bad idea; two chances, after all, are better
than one.

Ifboth groups go on, and if only one of them proves effective, both
groups will still beneﬁt. As long as in the end a tuition hike is avoided,
the whole student body will be the winners.

Letter

l The SGB Explains  

There are several purposes to
this letter. First, the Student
Government Board (SGB) wishes to
explain the reasoning behind our
decision to withdraw from the
Student Coalition against Tuition
Hikes (SCATH). Second, we wish
to present what we feel is a realistic
viewpoint on the question of the
impending tuition hike at Pitt.
Finally, we would like to outline our
attitudes on how to deal with the

I situation.

’ The concept of SCATH is a valid

‘ one: an effective way to ﬁght a

tuition hike is to organize a
broad-based coalition to organize

(the struggle. ‘ The question the

SGB had to deal with was: Is
SCATH, in reality, a broad-based
coalition? It is the opinion of the
Student Government that it is not.
Rather, SCATH has evolved into a
narrow group of activists who seem
to have lost sight of their original
goal. This is unfortunate, for any
‘group perceived in this way can
serve only to alienate the student
body. Additionally. the harass-
ment of both the administration
t and the Board of Trustees can, at
this point. serve only to place the
students in an adversary relation-
ship with those who must ultimate-
ly make the decision on tuition at
Pitt. Perhaps. as a ﬁnal measure,
this is the role that the student
(body shall be forced to assume. At
this juncture. however, it is both
premature and detrimental to the
attainment of our goal. It is the

. methods rather than the goals of

‘SCATH with which we find fault.

for the goal of all students stopping
‘or minimizing the tuition hike.

The ultimate goal of SGB is. of

‘course, to completely avoid, any

increase in tuition. The chances of
this are remote.
dramatic increase in the state’s
appropriations to Pitt are slim at
best. This is due to several factors.
First, the legislature in Harrisburg
has, over the past few years, come
tolook upon subsidies for higher
education less and less favorably.
Thus. it is doubtful we can expect
any great realignment of state
priorities. In other words, massive
program cuts on the state level to
channel more money into subsidies
for Pitt are unlikely. Therefore, the
way for the state to gain more

money for Pitt is through increased ‘

taxation. Disregarding for a
moment the social implications of
such measures, consider that 1976
is an election year, and no
politician votes for a tax increase in
an election year. Thus, while the
chances or additional subsidies
from Harrisburg are" good, it is very
unlikely that the increase will be
substantial. '

The majority of the belt-tighten-
ing. then. must be accomplished
here at the University level. While
the SGB is optimistic that. after
careful review of University budget
policy, there are many areas
where money can be saved and
redirected. it is unrealistic to
assume that these cuts will be of a
great enough magnitude to offset
both the lack of sufficient state
funds and the rise in costs over the
past year. This ‘is not to say that
there is no possibility that tuition
for next year will remain the same.
Rather. the SGB feels that.
realistically. there will be a tuition
hike next year and that the
emphasis of both the SGB and the

student body should be directed

A Kite Fly to Yesteryear

. BY JOHN METCALFE

I am inclined to think about nostalgia today, and
perhaps even to indulge in a little of it myself. Two of
my reasons come from a single bit of news. Frank
Sullivan died recently. The name might be familiar
only to people who learned to read and write a decade
or two or even four ago. Lately, I’ Sullivan was
best-known for his annualiChristmas poem in The
New Yorker, which wished all the best, in couplets.
to a few score of those who had attracted public
attention in the year past.

I will not attempt to paraphrase or exerpt these
rhymes, and the law does not permit me to steal one
whole; I will simply recommend them to browsers
among back issues of the magazine. .

For more than 50 yars, Sullivan poured out poems,
stories, essays, news, commentary and reﬂections on
the world in general. In general, it was a pretty bad
50 years, but he never forgot it was always funny,
too. ‘ i I V

severe colds. It has rained or snowed every day since
the kite came into our house. He has sniveled on each
of those days that he must ﬂy his kit. I‘ have daily
barked that he may not. I already was disillusioned
by'the thing itself. It was not a frail construction of
balsa wood and red tissue paper. It was frail, to be
sure, but it was frail plastic. On the plastic was the
eternal face of Mickey Mouse. 

A I began to grow angry at our kite. (This is a good If
way to prepare oneself for nostalgia.) The more .

~ closely I examined the thing. the less I was pleased. I

already was galled that it was no longer a dime for
the kite and a nickel for a ball of string. The propor-
tions of the investment were -unchanged, but the
prices had increased tenfold. Inﬂation has struck
harder in kites than anywhere else. And again. the
thing was made of plastic. It did not‘ in any way
suggest that a broken kite might be restored to ﬂight
with a sheet of tissue paper—or even newspaper-,-
and some glue.

Even the string was offensive. It was not the sturdy
cotton of my youth, but ‘a slippery synthetic cord,

For many years, I have cherished one sentence of
his, and I shall go on doing so. It is an observation on
the subject of nostalgia: “The present mood, to alter
a well-known deﬁnition of poetry, is one of
tranquillity recollected in emotion, the emotion being

‘ nostalgia.” The matter could not be better put. and
I think he would enjoy an extra irony added by-the
passage of _time—his deathless line was written in
1951, a year for which the midguided of today often
yearn. ‘

And so I come to my own nostalgia—nostalgia,
indeed, for a time not too long after 1951.

Jack is" now three years old. He has both of the
virtues and all of the vices of his age. (The virtues: 1)
He is no longer a baby. 2) He is not yet an adult.) One
of the vices is greed, coupled with a desire to have
exactly what other kids play with. We consider this to

be evidence of his independence,-as nobody has ~

forced the desire for regimentation on him; he has
invented it for himself. We are growing subtle.

He has seen a kid with a kite. .1 have bought him a
kite. Since that day, we both have been afﬂicted with

pearly to look at and impossible to knot. It was wound L‘ ' I
on its spool in the familiar endless spiral. but ther-Evils‘ —
was scarcely 200 feet of it. ‘I could throw a kite that

far. '

I have assembled this travesty and hung it from a
book in the living-room ceiling. The weather has
improved no more than our health. Jack is indifferent
to his kite when he is not whining about it. I try to

ignore the odd shadows it casts about the room. We
are both anxious for good ﬂying weather. I am sure
Jack will‘ be delighted at the launch and ﬂight
(however short) of his own aircraft. I expect to be
rather pleased myself. When it crashes, as all kites
do. he will be stunned at my indifference to his
tragedy.

Indeed, he will be full of the stuff that one day will
lead him to a vague nostalgia for the calm and safety
of the middle 1970s. But his nostalgia will rest

nothing but crumpled pastic; that. will be 

standard by_which he judges the declineof the world
into something even worse when he is an adult.
I think Mr. Sullivan would find all this funny.

SCATH’s Side of Walkout  

Last year a campaign was begun

 this campus against a tuition

,1,‘



hike. Did this campaign deal with
the causes of tuition hikes? No. By
failing to deal with the underlying
issue of how university priorities
are set by the administration, the

Board of Trustees, and the state b

legislature, START-UP Day could
not fully understand why tuition
was going up, who was respon-
sible, what their interests were,
and what the interests of those
affected were. It could adopt the
narrowest of tactics, directed at the
narrowest of problems.
-3 Was that narrow tactic an
effective tactic? —No. While letter-
writing has some small degree of
effect on legislators, $10,000 from a
corporate executive makes a bigger
impression than 10,000 letters from
students.

Did the campaign unite all those
whose interests lay in opposing a
raise in tuition? No. By limiting its
focus and narrowing its tactics, it
could only appeal to a small
percentage of undergraduates
while ignoring the needs of most
undergraduates, graduate stu-
dents, and university employees.
Last month a struggle was begun

this campus against tuition

l,¢_.{kes. Does this struggle deal with

‘s

Yes—and no.

the causes of tuition hikes?
Although there is
now a realization of the general
problem, a need for more facts
about the speciﬁcs of the problem
has prevented effective communi-
cation of the issues, which has
limited the success of the struggle.
Were the tactics used in this
struggle effective? Yes—and no.1
While mass action based on clear
and widespread understanding of
problems is the only method

concentrate on involving all people
affected by misplaced university

In the middle of a SCATH
meeting last Thursday night,
approximately forty people walked
in. Most of these people had never
been there before, and had come
only to vote on a proposal that SGB
take control of SCATH. When this
motion was defeated, they were
unwilling to stay and begin active
planning and’ participation in
SCATH’s activities. Student
Government in effect proposed to
unilaterally decide the future
activities of all the members of the
coalition, including black students

cally represented by the SGB. This
motion was undemocratic, in that it
attempted to impose domination of
the few over the many; racist, in
that it explicitly ignored and
opposed the needs of black
students as these students have
defined them; and elitist, in that it
exhibited the paternalistic belief
that a few people know what is best
for all.

Our opposition,
Vice-Chancellor Freeman,
that we should satisfy ourselves
with working out a compromise
with the Pitt administration on
tuition hikes and program cut-
backs. What this boils down to is a
willingness on the part of SCATH’s
critics to accept hikes and cutbacks.
In fact, SCATH’s critics have not
taken any action inopposing tuition
hikes, but only in opposing
SCATH. SCATH, on the_other
hand, wants to build a‘ movement of

By advocating only a letter-‘
writing campaign and talks be-
tween SGB and the administration,
the Board is essentially repeating
last year's mistakes. SCATH, on
the other hand, sees that our only
real power lies in our numbers and
our willingness to create the kind of
public outcry that cannot be
ignored. SCATH is investigating
who is affected by University
priorities, how they are affected,
and how they can join together to
most effectively deal with these
problems.

Student Government wants an
organization under its own aegis
that will be considered “legiti-
mate" by the Pitt administration.
SCATH .is an organization struc-
tured to allow” the greatest
democratic participation by all who
oppose tuition hikes and cutbacks._

Some Questions

7For Dorm System

Having noted recent statements
(i, the Pitt News by SGB that it
fgﬁnts to examine areas where
administrative spending could be
reduced and Dr. Posvar’s desire to
“spread the budgetary sacriﬁce,” I
would like to suggest an area to
both ‘SGB andthe Chancellor to
look at—Pitt’s dormitory System.
’ Many students may notknow it
but there is presently an entity at
Pitt known as the Office of Auxilary
Services. It oversees "all housing
and food service functions at the
branch campuses. Since it handles
the food service at the Oakland

campus, you’d think Pitt would-be'_ .
..;¥§‘gical and have it oversee ' all--"

 xf€=using functions too, right?

Wrong! Here they have two
offices to handle the dorms: the
Housing Office (under Auxilary
Servies and the Office of Business
and Finance) and the Office of
Residence Life (ORL) (under a
totally separate Vice Chancellor
i.e.: Student Affairs(. This makes
for inefficient administration which
in these tough times hurts
students. An example is in order.
While Housing was trying to
minimize costs by having alternate

ﬂurces of funds (vending and

I /,{:ball machines), ‘Residence. Life-

sought the removal of said pinball
machines which would’ve cut
$10,000 from Housing’s budget.
Although both offices were acting
in -what they thought was the
student interest, if ORL was
successful it would’ve cost students

and things cost enough as it is.
' It would be logical and probably

more efficient to place the

Residence Life functions under
Auxilary Service oversight. One
might say that the offices should be
kept separate because ORL's
educational activities are incompa-
table with Business and Finance,
but I learned in a conversation with
an assistant to the Director of
Residence Life that ORL doesn’t
conceive of its purpose as
educational now but rather that of
ruleadministration. Is a totally
separate ofﬁce needed for that?

Apparently Pitt didn’t think so.
Before 1972, only the Housing
Ofﬁce existed.

The next question is which Vice
Chancellor should the dorm system
be under? Housing and Food
Service deal with things such as
long-term debt management,
maintenance, and labor contract
negotiations. It would be illogical
and verycostly to place an ofﬁce in
an area where it can’t get the
appropriate support services.
Since running the dorms is to a
large extent ﬁnance-oriented, the
most logical place for its total
administration would be Business
and Finance. _

With my experience in the
National Association of College and
University Residence Halls, I’ve
seen that Pitt’s setup is unusual if
not unique. Either it should
contribute something special and
worth the cost, or should be
discontinued.

Obviously, the issue deserves
further study, preferrably by a
body external to Student Affairs
and'Business and Finance (perhaps
the University Senate Budget
Policies Committee). Towards that
end, Iintend to raise the matter for
discussion and_ possible further
action at the ‘April_j12 University
Senate "'Co1"1"ncili meeting‘. . ' ~ '

Food Service
Criticism Unfair

The food service provided in the
dormitories is often compared to
those at other colleges—Penn State
in particular. This comparison is
often made in an unjust manner so
as to ‘make it appear ‘as if the
students at Pitt are at a grave.
disadvantage. Having recently
surveyed the food service at Penn"

5' State, I think it is about time that

someone questions this comparison
and bring to light some facts that
often go unmentioned or unno-
ticed. Firstly, the mandatory 19
meal plan for freshmen is often
criticized. However, Penn State is
not compared in this category. This

is because all resident students,
whether freshmen or upper-class-
men, are required to purchase a
mandatory 21 meal plan. Per year
the students at Penn State pay $253
more than the students here. For
this amount of money the students
at Penn State are provided with a
food service which is inferior in
many ways. For instance, the
students at Penn State are provided
only two entrees per meal, instead
of four, as at Pitt. The students
there also lack some of the
“essentials of life” like a carbona-
ted beverage machine, steak and
carved roast beef special events,
permission to eat in the cafeteria of
their choice, bag lunches, training

‘BY MARY ANNE GORSKI

As you throw your alarm clock

‘ _ ing the wall but also allowing you to
" oversleep and miss your first class
‘for the seventh time this month.
i , you think: “There must be abetter

way.

' You’re right, there is. For a few

‘T measly dollars a month you can
,have a sweet-voiced maiden

awaken you gently with a cheery

"word and verbal smile.

How, you ask, can you partake of
"this life-saving service? Just call
your local answering service and
say “Help!” Then you will be
telephoned every morning at any
time you choose—several times if

 ; you wish—by an on-time angel of

mercy.

There are several area answering

’ services which offer to wake you

up. One, the Abel-1 answering
service, says this method is
primarily for people who can’t
wake up any other way. According
to Rosemary Dietrich of Abel-1, the
customers are mostly single young
men who say they don’t have wives
or mothers to get them out of bed
every morning.

“There are also people on
odd-houred shifts you use the
service to prevent them from being
late for work. One customer
needed the service to wake her in
time for her job as a secretary. She
overslept because she worked
nights as a go-go dancer,” Dietrich
said.

“The operators ringuntil the
party answers and thoroughly
irritate them with cheerful talk
until they are really awake,”
Dietrich continued. The operators
also call to “check in” on elderly
people as a service to concerned

relatives.

Walter Robbins ot the Robbins
Answering Service claims that this
is a little-proﬁt service for people
who “really need it." According to
Robbins, the idea of wake-up
services has been around since the
1920s. “It started as part of the
answering service for doctors who
had to see patients at odd hours.
We still perform this duty, but
most of our customers are single
men under thirty-ﬁve,” Robbins
said.

The operators will ring as long as
possible in order to make sure the
person is really awake. Being
greeted with a cheery “hello” and
“my isn’t it a nice day” can really
start the day off right—at least
that's what customers have told
Robbins. _ The operators get to
know the people they wake up
every morning and gear their
“good morning” to that specific
individual. ‘

Robbins suggested people who
can’t wake up should try a clock
radio or a friend before subscribing
to his service. The service is more
expensive. 1

Many of his customers are shift
workers and a few work for radio
and TV stations and have to work at
strange hours.

If you’re really in bad shape, you
can get run out of bed twice at any
time interval of your choice. It
seems there are some people who
need to be called twice and must be
told that this is the “last call”
before their brains starts to
function properly.

“Occasionally we. get a desper-
ate call from someone threatened
with being fired if they’re late one
more time—we can help them,”
Robbins said.

have occurred to you that this

his cheery good morning at any

Pitt Jazz: Style Mix

BY NORM MARTELLO

Jazz has come along way from
the tavern to the conservatory.
Expectation ﬁlled the audience as
they waited for that ﬁrst, sweet

note that would signal the start of

last Saturday night’s spring concert
by the University of Pittsburgh
Jazz Ensemble.

Dr. Nathan Davis conducted the
ensemble, enthusiastically keeping
time and shaping the dynamic
movement of the band’s sound.

Outstanding players included
tenor sax soloist Walter Beier (“It
was the best concert I’ve ever
played.”),. Pittsburgh guitarist Joe
Negri, and former trumpeter for
Blood, Sweat and Tears, Lew
Soloff.

“I talk to the people, I bring
them ‘my’ music,” says tenor and
alto saxophone jazz virtuoso, Eric -
Kloss. Kloss can be seen four
nights a week at Sonny Daye’s
Stage Door in Oakland, and
whether he is onstage performing,
or offstage chatting, Kloss talks
and lives the power of music.

“Music is the universal
language; it brings people closer
together. Old people can be
getting off on Lawrence Welk in
their living rooms, while a kid’s
upstairs blasting the Rolling
Stones. It doesn’t make any
difference what type it is: music is
ﬂexible,” Kloss said.

‘ ‘I’ve done clinics and things like
this all around the country,” Soloff
said, “but I’ve never heard a band
that swung more than Nathan
Davis’ band, here.”

The ﬁrst half swung with a
brash,’ bright big band sound on
tunes such as Belgian Francy
Boland’s “Griff’s Groove,” which

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Four months of Pantherette
basketball ended last week when
Cheyney State put Pitt out of the
running for the Eastern Regional
Championship, and the dreams of
winning a national championship
must be stored away until next
winter.

But did this year prove anything
about the Pantherettes? ___While
their 13-5 overall record"'is” an
improvement over last season’s
10-6, many people are skeptical
about the team’s progress.

Just prior to the season’s opener,
the intersquad blue-gold game,
came the controversial dismissal of
Coach Jean Condo. There was talk
the Pantherettes would boycott the
game in protest, and new head
coach Pat Wallace was thrust into
an uncomfortable position.

When the Pantherettes ﬁnished
second in the Pitt Invitational (the
past year they'd won their own
tournament's championship) criti-
cism began. And when Pitt
suffered a string of losses in
mid-February, the complaints grew
louder. ~ _’

. Much of the criticism came from

the acquisitions of forward Mimi_
Senkowski and guard Leslie Diehl. '

Wallace, who coached both athle-

tes at Lancaster Catholic High,

School, was accused of playing
favorites and shouts from the

J. stands became quite common as

particular, made enormous strides
in her defensive abilities. Diehl
became accomplished at stealing
the ball. Degrading the abilities of
either is unfounded.
guessing the coach is part of the
game, but I will not describe the
times I thought Cindy DiGiacomo

should have been in the line-up or.

Debbie Jones should have been
rested.

What I will say is that the team
had a different style under Wallace
and no one should have expected
her to carry on Condo’s game
plans: it was a new season, a new
coach, a new situation, and
whether or not Wallace will be
successful can not be fully
evaluated after just one season.
And Wallace should be commend-
ed for the candid honesty she,
displayed all season—something
few other coaches have.

Something no one could ﬁnd
fault with is the play of Jones: she

was phenomenal throughout the

season—from‘ averaging 14.7‘
\ points and 20.7 rebounds in the

Invitational (she snared a high of 30
rebounds agianst Glassboro, mid-
way through the competition) to
that ﬁnal game against Cheyney.

It’s too bad there are no statistics to

record the times Jones dove across

the ﬂoor for a loose ball or led an
impenetratable defensive screen,
but one fact remains—Jones is one
great basketball player» and the
assumption that follows is she can
only get better. I A

“We’ll be trying to win each

said. “If we play well‘ in each

take care of itself. We'd like

‘nothing better than to improve on

Sure, everyone hopes to set the
world on ﬁre before the season

overruled by two recent Federal

banned in the next two years and
all 600 major leaguers will become
free agents.
Saturday, the club owners
rejected a proposal that they should
‘not start the 1976 season without a
new labor agreement. The owners
gave the members of the Players
Relations Committee a unanimous
vote of conﬁdence and instructions
to push for a solution to the dispute
as soon as possible. No vote was
taken on the proposal, but there
was clearly insufficient support for
delaying the season. Presumably,
the six club ofﬁcials and two league
presidents will go on with the
negotiations. Continued support of

  Kentucky Wins NIT

Stops Ncc, 71-67

NEW YORK (AP)—-Mike Phil-
lips delivered ﬁve key points in the

last minute and Kentucky, helped’

by two North Carolina Charlotte
turnovers in the late going, won the
39th National Invitation Tourna-
ment Sunday with a 71-67 victory
over the 49ers.

The championship game wasn't
decided before the Kentucky
strongman took over with three
foul shots and a ﬁeld goal as the
Wildcats earned their second
championship in this college
basketball tournament, but their
first since 1946.

The teams were never more than

seven points apart in the wild.

second half before the game
changed in Kentucky’s favor with
1:06 remaining. Before the Wild-
cats took charge, Cedrick Maxwell
scored two of his game leading 24
points with 1:30 remaining, while
the crowd of 12,415, most of its
North Carolina Charlotte rooters,
cheered the 49ers on.

Reggie Warford, who had kept‘
Kentucky in the game in the second
half with 10 points, ﬁred in a bomb
with 1:07 left to provide the
Wildcats with the go ahead points
at 64-63. - 

Philli_ps, Kentucky’s 6 foot 10,
230 pound center, who was a first
half force with 10 points, then sank
two free throws at 1:06 to provide
the Wildcats 66-63 lead. Phillips
was fouled on the Warford shot.

The 49ers, a Cinderella team in
this tournament with two upset
victories in previous games, had a
chance’ to pull closer to Kentucky,
but Kevin King threw the ball away

while the 49ers were working for a

shot and the Wildcats took over
possession with 46 seconds remain-
ing.

Melvin Watkins stole the ball
from Kentucky but walked, giving-
the Wildcats another key turnover
in the last minute. -

But the game still had lots of
action left. On the Kentucky
inbounds pass, Maxwell deﬂected
the ball and batted it to Watkins,
who ﬁred in a jumper at the foul
line with 34 seconds left to trim
Kentucky’s lead to 66-65.

That was the closest the 49ers
came, however. Larry Johnson
connected on two foul shots with 22
seconds remaining to provide the
winners with a 68-65 lead, then
Phillips tipped in a missed foul shot
by Johnson with nine seconds let:

‘to provide the Wildcats’ with a

game clinching 70-67 lead and the
Wildcats’ 10th straight victory.

Phillips, who scored 16 points in
the -game, later added a foul shot
for the ﬁnal score.

With Lew Massey scoring six of
his 16 points, North Carolina
Charlotte took a 57-51 lead with

nine minutes left in the game. But .»'{"<.:” '

then Johnson scored four points in
a 9-2 Kentucky spurt to trigger the
Wildcats into a 60-59 lead with 3:32
left.

Johnson later gave the Wildcats
a 62-61 lead with 2:02 remaining to
set the stage for the wild ending.

Johnson matched Phillips with
16’ points. Wafford added 14 for
Kentucky, 20-10.

North Carolina Charlotte closed
out its season at 24-6_. A .

uality among males is in the
“macho groups," including cow-
boys. truck drivers and athletes.

Tripp, author of the book “The
Homosexual Matrix," said Wed-

All OPEN LETTER

March 19, ‘I976
Dear Friends, _ ’

My connection with the University has just been severed, and I would like to bring to your attention the specific circumstances
under which this has occurred, since it is my belief that they reflect an only too common pattern of administrative arbitrariness and disdain
for the most elementary principles of integrity.

A number of years ago I was instrumental in setting up the FAS Tenure and Promotion Review Board. I thought at the time that
the majority of the faculty in FAS desired to assume responsibility and control over the process of tenure in order to prevent what I then
perceived as administrative excesses and arbitrary acts which resulted in the firing of many of our most gifted younger faculty.'l observed
with dismay the process of erosion and limitation of the Board's powers and the Dean's disregard of many of its recommendations. It be-
came apparent to me that the situation could only be fedlressed by unionization on this campus, in the absence of any other legal guaran-
tees for due process and the increasing arbitrariness of an administration whose highest priorities do no include maintaing academic freedom
or improving the quality of education.

The process of unionization has been a lengthy one, and still remains to be completed. In the meantime, the FAS Tenure and
Promotion Review Board and the Senate Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure remain the only elected faculty bodies entrusted
with the responsibility of ensuring that due process be available to all members of the academic community. However, as you no doubt
know, these bodies have only advisory functions, their recommendation is made to the Dean (whose treatment of my case is outlined be-
low) and is not binding upon the administration at any level. This is why I have decided to turn to you and ask for your support.

I have not been fired for lack of academic achievement. My work over the last few years has received the highest evaluation by
the top specialists in my field. John Fennell of Oxford, Alexandre Bennigsen of the Sorbonne, Tibor Halasi-Kun of Columbia and lhor
Sevcenko of Harvard have praised it as a most significant and innovative contribution. My book, "The Sourge of God.; the Mongol domina-
tion of Russia," completed last year has been accepted for publication by Mouton, a highly reputable academic publisher, in the new;,series
"Monographs on Medieval Eurasia.” The quality of my academic achievements and teaching record was not, however, relevant in the absence
of due process. In point of fact, only the appearance of due process was maintained: an ad hoc committee was created and presented its rec-

ommendation, after which the Dean proceeded to dismiss me. His authority in the matter is absolute, under the rules imposed by our

administration.

My contention is that the Dean has acted in a self-serving manner in my case, with a disregard for the most basic rules of honesty
—without which any process is vitiated. A misrepresentation of evidence was perpetrated on an unsuspecting ad hoc committee. When the
facts were re—established and the committee's recommendation was not the one which had been sought, the committeewas disregarded.

The facts are as follows: »

1. In October of last year Dean Rosenberg received a lengthy recommendation for tenure signed by 19 tenured members of my department,
and took no administrative action. Four months elapsed, during which he attempted, without success, to disrupt the consensus which the
department had reached.

2. An ad hoc committee was finally created and convened at the beginningof February, 1976, and met in secret session, in the Dean's pres-
ence (as permitted by our questionable administrative practices). At that meeting, the committee did not see my complete file. The list of
19 signatures endorsing my departmental recommendation was purloined. The absence of this list, coupled with Dean Rosenberg’s com-
ments, totally transformed the letter of recommendation into a lengthy commentary of little consequences, bearing my chairman's signa-
ture alone. This signature appeared directly below the text’, while the signatures of the other tenured members had been placed on the
following page. The members of the committee, who had the impression that my file contained no letter from the department, inquired
as to the departmental recommendation on my behalf. They were left with the impression that such a recommendation was not a manda-
tory procedure in every case, i.e. that it did not exist in this particular one, the department having had difficulty in making up itsmind.
Let me note at this point that the latter part of this statement is true while the former is not. My department did discuss my candidacy at
great length and methodological differences were brought out in the course of the debate. However, this debate did result in the issuing
of a letter recommending tenure upon which 19 individuals, being of sound mind, placed their signatures.

The ad hoc committee, unaware of the existence of a letter recommending me fortenure signed by 19 tenured members
of my department, recommended to the Dean that I be dismissed, and thereupon was dissolved, having fulfilled its function. I

'3. Immediately after these events, a member of the committee asked the chairman of my department whether or not the departmental _rec-

ommendation had included a signature letter. The chairman stated that the recommendation was indeed such a letter. Confronted by my
chairman, the Dean immediately alleged that he does not ”usually” present the list ofsignatures of the tenured members of a candidate's
department to his ad hoc committee. This assertion was found to be false by checking with a number oflfaculty members who have served
on many ad hoc committees._ In any event, the deletion of the list of signatures in my case was a significant misrepresentation of a depart-
mental decision. Upon my chairman's insistence, thead hoc committee was reconvened. '

When the full file was finally made available, the faculty members of the ad hoc committee reversed their original decision by a
majority and supported the department's recommendation for tenure. At this.second meeting of the committee, the Dean brought in a mem-
ber of the administration responsible to his office, who had not participated in the committee's original meeting. This administrator's vote
was counted in the Dean's report to the Provost. '

Dean Rosenberg then proceeded to fire me.

The Senate Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure has begun to deal with this case. The Dean was requested on March 3
to convene a panel of the FAS Tenure and Promotion Review Board. As of this date he has not replied. Since my contract ends on April 30
of this year, his silence amounts to procrastination.

I can only speculate as to the reasons for this action taken against me. I have struggled for years in an attempt to enlarge the
scope of faculty responsibility within the framework of FAS, and to lessen administrative intrusion into the educational practices of this
institution. With the enactment of Public Law 195 I became one of the founders of the Pitt Professional Union and helped to bring about
the present election on this campus. I cannot help but think that -these activities are partly responsible for my present situation, since they
have not endeared me to the administration. A further cause might be divergent political views between Dean Rosenberg and myself on a
subject of high emotional content for both of us, namely the present situation in the Middle East, a subject that I have been dealing with in
one of my courses for a number of years. From this perspective, my dismissal was decided long ago, on grounds which can be termed politi-
cal in the fullest meaning of the word.

The case before you is not unique. It is my firm conviction that many junior faculty have been dealt with in the past in similar

fashion. Nor am I the only person on this campus who is being presently dismissed with the flimsiest of pretexts and the help of administra- .

tive manipulation. This only stresses again our need for responsible collective bargaining which would ensure a mutually agreed upon mech-
anism ensuring due process in cases of reappointment, promotion and tenure.

The political nature of my dismissal cannot, of course, be substantiated; it is sufficient to note that it constitutes the only pos-
sible background for the various machinations which have been described above. My case before you does not rest on a demonstration of
malicious intent, but on that of malfeasance, defined by Webster as "an act or instance of wrongdoing, especially by a public officer under
color of authority of his office." The logo of our University was, until two years ago, Veritas et Virtus. Since then it has been, significantly
I believe, modified. I beg you to apply to my case these criteria to which we all subscribe and express to the Chancellor and the Board of
Trustees your indignation concerning the Dean's improprieties and your support of my candidacy for tenure.

I wish to thank the PPU for its efforts on my behalf (including the present advertisement) and urge you to support the Union
at the coming election of March 30.

( The Roub/ey case is only one of dozens like it that have come to our attention since we
began the drive for unionization at Pitt. In an era of cut-backs in higher education, secret
budgets, and declining efficacy of the traditional forums of faculty authority, administra-
tions feel they can afford to play fast and loose with due process and ignore the delibera-
tions and recommendations of duly constituted review committees.

{Collective bargaining is the most effective means to increase the faculty's capacity for self-
government and to eliminate arbitrary and unilateral decisions by the administration. This is
what the PPU is striving to achieve.)
