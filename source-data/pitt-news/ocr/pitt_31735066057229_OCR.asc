Library and Information Science
from $4,930 to $5,150; Nursing and
Health and Rehabilitation Sciences
from $5,846 to $6,108; and
Pharmacy from $6,690 to $6,990.

Out—of—state students will pay 6

Medical Center tower to replace Library Annex

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

A three-story underground public park-
ing garage is scheduled to be built where
the Pitt Library Annex stands.

The library annex, which was recently
sold to the University of Pittsburgh Medical

Center for $900,000 by the university, will
be the first phase of a planned 10-story
office complex.

The complex will house 16,000 square
feet of retail space on the first floor, with
the remaining floors of the tower given
over to administrative and academic offices
for the medical school, according to med-

ical center spokesperson Lauren Ward.
Local architect T asso Katselas will design
the medical complex for UPMC, according
to \X/ard.Nadco Construction will be the
general contractor, according to a
spokesperson at Katselas’ office.

aws attention to organ donor bill

By Suzann Gries

Gov. Robert P. Casey contin-
ues to do well as he recovers
from last week’s heart—liver
transplant, University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center
spokesperson Jane Duffield

According to hospital staff,
the governor is in good spirits
and has started on a heart-
healthy diet.

Casey’s surgery has height-
ened the public’s awareness of
the lack of donor organs and
the agonies experienced by

‘“-*~»"tthose> waitin*g“f‘or ~lifesa“i‘r"3i‘ri‘g“"”*
transplants and their familéi§{s’,‘,,,»./

Pennsylvania state Sen. Mike
Dawida (D—Allegheny) said. 
When Casey underwentihis
double transplant one day after
going on the waiting list, specu-
lation arose that he received
preferential treatment.

However, ‘Dawida said this is
‘unfounded .and,~draws attention
away from the more important
issue -——the critical shortage of
organs. 

“Concerns that the governor
jumped ahead on the list are not
true and are,_ obscuring the fact
that more donors are needed in

‘order to save more lives,”

Dawida said.

The senator is sponsoring leg-
islation aimed at increasing», the
pool of available organs. 

Presently, individuals who
wish to donate their organs after
death carry donor cards or have

By Gigi Douban
For The Pitt News

What began as an ordinary night of
watching the evening news ended in
one woman’s newfound fascination with
politics.

When scenes from the Iranian
Revolution flashed before her on the
screen, Professor Sandra Halperin found
it among the most compelling things she
had seen on television.

"I was riveted by the sight of the peo-
ple in the streets making their own histo-
ry and by the fact that no one saw it
coming,” Halperin said,

With an undergraduate degree from
the Julliard School in New York,
Halperin went on to obtain her doctoral
degree in political science from the‘
University of California at Los Angeles,
focusing on international relations and
comparative politics with a minor in
middle-east studies.

Today, Professor Halperin teaches a

uate and graduate levels at Pitt, including
intemational-relations theory, world pol-
itics, government and politics in the
Middle East, and religion and politics in
the Middle East.

In addition to teaching, she is working
on a project to turn her dissertation into
a book about war and social change.
The book will compare 19th century
Europe to the Middle East since 1945.

“We need to reassess the standard
story we tell about European historical
development in light of what we are see-
ing today in the Middle East and other
so-called third—world regions. Often peo-
ple say you can’t compare development
patterns in Europe with those in the con-
temporary third world, and I’m challeng-
ing that,” I-ialperin said.

She also said that people tend to ideal-
ize European historical development as
something more peaceful and gradual
than it actually was.“It is interesting to
study more than one part of the world
because it allows us to draw compar-

variety of courses at both the undergrad-

Endowed chair created

Byjack Finn

Asst. News Editor

The Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business has estab-
lished an endowed chair in Management Control Systems, a ﬁeld
that deals primarily with strategic and long-range goal planning.

Professor Jacob Bimberg is the first Robert W. Murphy, Jr.
chairholder. Murphy, a former Pitt student, endowed $1 million
for the chair. When asked why he chose Pitt to receive his $1 mil-
lion endowment, Murphy said, “I like Pitt.”

Murphy is president of Quicksilver Golf Club in" Washington
County. He is the former president and CEO of Lender Services,
Inc., the country’s leading appraisal management, title-insurance
agency and closing—management fim1.“It’s nice to have someone
recognize your work, tell you nice things, that you’re doing a
good job,” Birnberg said.

The endowment will allow Bimberg to “attend a few more
meetings, bring in some lecturers for the staff, and in general,
provide some discretionary funds to go the extra mile,” he said.

“Endowments are important in attracting and maintaining top
faculty,” KGSB Dean H.J. Zoffer said. “Professor Bimberg is an
outstanding candidate in this area; we didn’t have to look any
further.” According to Zoffer, an endowment is a gift to the
school by an individual or corporation which is invested and the
interest pays for the chair.

Brain injuries focus of WPIC program

By Gigi Douban
For The Pitt News

A man falls down a ﬂight of
stairs. A woman undergoes a
stroke. A man is diagnosed
with having a brain tumor.

In all of these scenarios, the
person involved has suffered
injury to the brain. The Brain
Injury Program, which opened
March 29 at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic, focuses on
treating that portion of the pop-
ulation affected by brain injury-
related disorders.

Brain Injury Program Medical
Director Dr. Craig Taylor said,
“We are interested in treating
neurobehavioral disorders. The
neuropsychiatric and neurobe—
havioral population requires
special needs not provided by
the rest of the medical center.”

Most often brain injuries lead
to cognitive, emotional and
behavioral instability, accord-

ing to Taylor.

He said the neurosurgery
department treats only the
physical damage of brain
injuries while the Brain Injury
Program seeks to stabilize
abnormal behaviors deter-
mined to be a result of the
patient’s brain injury.

According to Taylor, brain
injuries can result in disorders
ranging from seizures to psy-
chopathic behavior. Because of
the wide range of brain-injury
cases, treatment methods are
vast.

Brain injuries may even result
in a person’s inability to func-
tion in a community, Taylor
said. For this reason he said he
has spoken at several rehabili-
tation centers, support groups
and hospitals.

“We hope that people can be
better informed and equipped
to deal with brain injury-related
behavioral disorders,” he said.

The program gains its finan-
cial support from revenues
generated from inpatient ser-
vices, according to Taylor.

The program is not driven by
research, he said, although
research is done in conjunction
with the program.

Educating the public about
brain injuries and the effects -
other than physical — they
may have on an individual is a
major goal of the program,
according to Taylor.

To be placed in the Brain
Injury Program, patients are
evaluated on the basis of
behavioral observation, neu-
ropsychiatric testing and an
extensive medical history, usu-
ally after referral from the neu-
rosurgery department, Taylor
said.

Neuropsychiatrists, occupa-
tional therapists, social workers
and nurses constitute the pro-
gram’s treatment staff.

For The pm News The search for the new faculty They are: Sujata Banerjee, a

The School of Library and
Information Sciences will be
welcoming five new faces with
international appeal to the fac-
ulty this fall.

“We’ve brought in outstand-
ing women as well as men,
especially minorities  we are
very proud of our faculty.” SLIS
Dean Toni Carbo Beannan said.
She has headed the school for
seven years.

SLIS is the largest library and
information school and has
been ranked very high interna-
tionally. The school has stu-
dents representing over 20 dif-
ferent countries, and 12 stu-
dents specifically from a coop-
erative agreement with Molde
College in Norway.

“Many students come in from‘

Norway for graduate work.
There are about 10 a term.
Other schools involved in the
exchange are [in] Morocco,
Wales, Brazil and Japan,” assis-
tant to the dean Susan Webreck

is done nationally and interna-
tionally.

An electronic bulletin board
advertises the chronicles of the
schools involved in the pro-
gram. The search commitee is
made up of between 15 and 120
people, depending on the num-
ber of new hires.

The committee is comprised
of faculty and staff from the
department that is hiring, stu-
dents from another department
in the school, and another staff
member from another part of
the campus.

When the candidates are
selected as finalists, they are
brought into the school for
interviews.

“[The new faculty] must be
interesting people who know
their stuff. They must be able to
grow with the faculty, con-
tribute to the field and stay
interesting,” Bearman said

The final few candidates are
recommended to the dean.
According to Bearman, SLIS was

native of India; Marek Jozef
Druzdzel from Holland; Dirk
Mahling of Germany; and
Louise Su and Arlene Taylor of
the United States.

Su is from Rutgers University
in New Jersey. She said she has
worked with many people who
have graduated from Pitt and
that all of the people were well
prepared and very good in their
field.

“What I believe is most
important is that there are small-
er classes, better opportunities
for research and a lot of ‘interac-
tion with the students. I feel that
it makes teaching much more
fun,” Su said. ‘

She also said she liked the
international diversity of the stu-
dents, especially the fact that
the students were very interest-
ed in her and that they were
very courteous.

Su said, “I felt very honored
to be chosen. Dean Bearman is
a very dynamic person. I am
very excited to join Pitt.”

The pioneer of Pitt’s unique dental-anesthesiology depart-
ment will be remembered during a two—day reunion which
will include the dedication of the Monheim Anesthesiology
Center at Salk Hall.

Leonard Monheim, the first chair of the department of
anesthesiology at Pitt’s Dental School, became the first U.S.
dentist to complete postdoctoral training in anesthesiology
and chair Pitt’s separate dental-anesthesiology department.

Monheim graduated from Pitt’s dental school in 1953. After
completing his postdoctoral training, Monheim became the
chair of the separate department of anesthesiology at Pitt’s
dental school in 1946. Previously it was part of the depart-
ment of oral surgery.

“The primary advantage [for having a separate dental-anes-
thesiology department] is that it is staffed by faculty specifi-
cally trained for anesthesiology; it is not a spin-off program.
Its main thrust is strictly anesthesiology, and people are
trained to be dental anesthesiologists as a separate residency.
This advances the cause of dental medicine,” said C. Richard
Bennett, Monheim’s successor and current chair of the
department of anesthesiology.

“Pitt has the longest continuously running dental-anesthesi-
ology program in the. world,” he said.

The Monheim Anesthesiology Center, a new facility exclu-
sively for outpatients, is especially suited for patients with
other medical problems, according to Bennett. _

“We have a clinical dental-anesthesiology program that
can’t be duplicated anywhere else. Pitt is the only dental
school in the country to have a separate anesthesiology
department,” he said.

“A lot of the patients have severe mental or physical handi-

caps which require advanced anesthesiology in  dental ~

care,” Bennett said.

Bennett studied under Monheim while earning a doctorate
in pharmacology and anesthesiology at Pitt. He worked with
Monheim as an assistant for seven years until Monheim died.

Both of Monheim’s textbooks have been translated into
five languages, and he ‘,started the first training program for ‘
nurses, physicians and dental anesthesiologists.  I ‘ -' w ‘-

Billed asthe’ “Monheim Memorial Weekend,” it

begins Friday,’Ju_ne'=25, with a cocktail party and perfomiance
by musician Haroldﬁetters at the -Pittsburgh Athletic‘
Association} ‘ ' "3 

“All funding for the center comes from private contribu-
tions, and we are looking for more,” Bennett said.

The center will be dedicated at 11 a.m. on June 26, Bennett
said, and a plaque honoring donors will be unveiled.

Budget

Continued from page 1
students, about 4 percent, from
2.654 to 2,550, according to
budget ﬁgures presented to the
committee by Assistant Vice
Chancellor of Business and
Finance Rhonda Cross.

"The decline in CO8 enroll-
ment was due in part to the
economy,“ Gross said. "At one
time, CGS had about 5,200
enrollment. Companies are cut-
ting back on paying for employ-
ee tuition.”

The overall budget for fiscal
year 1994 will increase from
$770.9 million to $802.4 million,
about 4.1 percent.

Highlights of the new budget
include:

-A transportation fee of 530
will be included for all students
for improvement of campus
transportation and security. This
is part of the $1.2 million

expenditure for campus securi-

ty and transportation. "Far and L

away, the preponderance of
monies will be spent on trans-
portation," said Senior Vice
Chancellor for Business and
Finance Ben Tuchi.

-The Commonwealth appro-
priation is expected to be
essentially the same as last
years although there is an addi-
tional $4.2 million available
through the Tuition Challenge
Grant program if Pitt holds in-
state tuition hikes to 4.5 per-
cent.

-The budget includes a $1.8
million increase in financial aid,
a 4.8 percent increase, of which
$400,000 will be used for
undergraduates and 81.4 mil-
lion for graduates.

Whereas the Student Loan
Fund is expected to remain at
the same level as 1993, the

financial-aid program will
receive a boost to offset the
higher tuition rates for 1994,
according to assistant director
for budget planning and analy-
sis Ken Fields.

“The Student Loan Fund
makes loans which require
repayment. Financial aid is in
the form of scholarships and
grants which generally do not
require repayment by the stu-
dent,” Fields said.

Financial aid is being
increased to attract the same
number of students who may
otherwise not be able to afford
to come to Pitt, according to
Fields.

Fields said he tmpliasized
that budgeted enrollment fig-
ures for 1994 are typically con-
servatively estimated, and may
vary with actual 1994 figures
when they are made available.

Board members expressed
concern with the rising cost of
attending Pitt, particularly in
comparison to other states‘ uni-
versities.

For example, residents of
Illinois face an increase of up to
20 percent in tuition but the fee
will still only be 32,983. The
University of California at Los
Angeles will increase 46.7 per-
cent to $4,260, and State
University of New York at
Buffalo will remain the same at
$2,650.

Pitt law professor Ed Symons,
one of two f21Cl' 3" representa-
tives on thr committee
expressed concern that the new
budgetary planning system was
being circumvented. “We are
stretching flexibility to the limit.
The pace of irreversibility is
picking up,” he said, regarding
Pitt's acquisition of new facili-

ties.

Symons said he is concerned
that Pitt continues to acquire
new properties without regard
to budgetary constraints.

"We have to spend tens of
millions of dollars on mainte-
nance for existing facilities. We
don‘t have a choice here. But
we seem to be adding build-
ings, like the Masonic Temple,
without regard to the process
set up to plan for long-range
budget planning," he said.
"New acquisitions are discre-
tionary and should be at the
end [of the budget processl but
maintaining existing facilities is
not ldiscretionaryl."

The proposed budget was
passed unanimously by the
budget committee and will be
presented to the full Boa1‘d of
Trustees for approval at its
meeting on June 24.

education will provide the information necessary to become

Organ donor shortage critical

On June 14, Pennsylvania Gov. ‘Robert P. Casey
received a heart-liver transplant. The governor was suf-
fering from amyloidosis, a progressive disease that
destroys body organs by generating surplus proteins that
other organs in the body cannot absorb. Transplantation
was his only hope for survival. '

Although Casey received his transplant within 24
hours, many people wait longer and continue to wait
every day. The desperate need for organ donors is not
new. Being a public official, Casey’s surgery made
instant headlines. Questions surfaced concerning
whether or not Casey was given higher priority on the
donor“ waiting list, but the real issue is the shortage of
donors. According to Pennsylvania state Sen. Mike
Dawida (D-Allegheny), “concerns that the governor
jumped ahead on the list are not true and are obscuring
the fact that more donors are needed in order to save
more lives.” Casey’s transplant'attracted the media, but
more importantly it publicizedthe need for’ more
donors. ' I

The lack of availability of organ donors stems from the
general public’s reluctance to think about their own
mortality. Pediatrician Dr. Mark M. Blatter said that peo-
ple refuse to think about death because of their own
fears. In the same manner that we avoid discussing our
wills and buying funeral plots, we hesitate to sign our
organ—donor cards, he said. ,

Although the thought of our own deaths is frighten-
ing, it is often worse to think about the deaths of those
we love. “Think of it as if it was your closest friend, or
your parents  if they need a transplant, they most like-

V ly won’t get one. You have to think about others,” said

Dawida’s attorney Martin Durkin. He also said that
Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel signed his organ-
donor card a few days after Casey’s transplant.
Becominga donor couldysave are life of. someone you
know — or it could’ just say; a life.  ;   .
The laclgof awareness of the organ-donation process
contributes to the sliortage of donors. Accdfdiﬁg to Dr.
Blatter-, many people first-"encounter the possibility of

organdonation in tl1e.l1ospital?afté§r’—'a loved one has

died. At such a time, careful and considerate decision-
making may not occur due to the great emotional tur-
moil surrounding a loved one’s death. Some people may
not even know if their relative wanted her or his organs

to be donated ——— or which organs. That is why it is cru-:
cial for people to decide in their lifetimes whether or not

to be an organ donor. It saves the survivors the task of
making a painful decision and could also save some-
one’s life. ‘

The general public must give careful thought to dona-"V

tion now, before more unnecessary deaths occur.

Operation Restore Hope a Hoax

We are going on with our program of making
peace and reconciliation with our people. I am
part of the people, and any action directed
against them I am sharing. America wants to put
our country in a trusteeship. This killing was

- done intentionally and the Somalis will never

forget.
— General Muhammad Farah Aidid
New York Times June 15, 1993

This is a society whose government does not

hesitate to inflict the most brutal forms of punish—_

ment and oppression on dark-
sleinned people all over the
world. ,

— El Hajj Malik El Shahhazz
(Malcolm X) 1965

Michael S. Barge

“Operation Restore Hope” was actually an
operation to restore a hoax. The motivation of the
United States to restore hope to Somalia must be
questioned because it was the United Stateswith
the help of its European friends which stripped
Somalians of their hope.

According to Saphronia Scott Gregory of Time
magazine, the reason for America’s initial interest
in Somalia was its strategic location for military
bases.

“Washington was eager for a strategic outpost
near Arabian oil fields and struck an agreement to
take over the old Soviet military
facilities.” ‘
Though America is guilty of
ﬂooding the country with mod-
ern weapons, the American press
hasacted as if Somalians, by

validates the assertion of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. thatthe United States has “committed more
war crimes almostvthan any nation in the world.”
The government of the United‘ States of

America’ often operates under the alias of the

United Nations. According to John Pilger in his
article‘ “The U.S. fraud in Af‘fii:a” which appeared
in the New Statesman 6} Society (January 8,
1993), the United Nations Security Council has
been “an instrument of U.S. power since the end

. of the Cold War.” Pilger continued by saying,
“ltlhe bloody coup ending democracy in Haiti in

1991 demonstrated this. In the Security Council,
the French argued that Haiti deserved ‘humanitar-
ian intervention’ by the UN They won consider-
able support, though not from the US.”

“The nature of the discussion,” wrote UN spe-
cialist Phyllis Bennis, “made clear the potential
targets were more likely to be those already
demonized by the west: Gaddaf1’s Libya, Saddam
Hussein’s Iraq, Kim Il Sung’s North Korea, Fidel
Castro’s Cuba, etc. The coup in Haiti was not on
the agenda.” In other words, the US would
decide. _

With the UN Security Council as puppets, the
United States can now throw stones at other
nations and hide its hands.

America entered the African nation of Somalia
on the widely advertised pretext that the
Somalians were starving. Also widely advertised
was the idea that the government of Somalia was
in a state of anarchy because of Somali “warlords”
— black men who were killing everybody in
sight with machine guns. At that point, George
Bush (whose love for black people is extremely
questionable) decided that it was his duty to
restore hope to the black people of Somalia.

deceivingthe majority of Americans into believ-
ing lies about the Somali people. '
John Pilger states that, “In Somalia, the [Marine

 Corps] and the media have an ideal enemy. Like

the British in pith helmets, they are facing amor-
phous ‘gangs’ of natives led by ‘warlords’. On the
[television] screen, Somalis are dehumanized.

ET here are no good Somalis, no wise Somalis, no

professional and organized Somalis. There are
those ‘warlords’ and their ‘gunmen’ and, of
course, their pathetic victims.” »V

One of the people used by the United States to
divide Somalians and destroy their hopes was a
traitor and political puppet named Siad Barre.
According to Human Rights Watch’s Holly
Burkhalter, the United States gave the Barre
regime “some [$50 million dollars] in ‘security-
related assistance.”

According to Randall Robinson of Trans Africa,
“when Siad Barre was overthrown, he was long a
client of the United States, with American
weapons to use against his own people. By then
[America could] have stepped in and seen to it
that the country was democratized and moved in
the right direction. But we did nothing then,
either. We simply ﬂew in a plane to evacuate
both Americans and Soviets in the region — any
whites — leaving Somalis to kill each other with
American and Soviet weapons.”

The blood of the Somali people is on America’s
hands. Operation Restore Hope is a hoax. When I
think of America’s criminal operation in Somalia I

‘think about how America has destroyed the

hopes of Africans in America —— 100 million mur-
dered and counting. I

The Hellacaust continues.

‘Sleepless’ a littl romance tat rings tru

By Aimee DeFoe
For The Pitt News

Sleepless In Seattle
Directed by Nora Ephron
Starring Meg Ryan and
Tom Hanks

People have long been getting ideas
about how life should be from the
movies. As ludicrous as we know it is,
its sometimes impossible to resist the
temptation to compare our lives to those
lovely pieces of light—manipulated cellu-
loid. This indulgent little societal habit
has found its way into the characters of
Nora F.phron’s Sleepless in Seattle.
Ephron somehow manages to make this
film a light investigation into our rela-
tionship with the happenings on the. big
screen as well as a wonderfully enter-
taining Hollywood piece.

The premise of -the film is all
Hollywood. Jonah, (Ross Malinger) the
son of a widowed architect in Seattle,
calls a national radio show’ to look for a
new wife for his bereaved father, Sam
(Tom Hanks). Clear across the country in
Baltimore, newspaper writer Annie Reed
(Meg Ryan) hears the broadcast and I I
becomes instantly obsessed with meet-
ing Sam, eventually does, and they do
the happily-ever-after thing. This plotline
understandably leaves those already

Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in Nora Ephron’s Sleepless In Seattle.

jaded towards Hollywood films even
more skeptical, or worse, wondering if
this is yet another cute-kid film.
However, Sleepless in Seattle actually
makes us believe this stuff can happen,
which is just how a good Hollywood
love story is supposed to work.

Ephron wants to call attention to the
distinction between love in real life and
love in the movies, and she does this by
having her characters as befuddled

about the whole thing as anyone. As we
sit there and watch Sam and Annie’s
romance evolve in front of us,
Hollywood is working on them at the
same time as they watch An Aﬂair to
Remember with Cary Grant on late night
television. This figures into their story
later when we end up watching charac-
ters in a movie experiencing real love
based on the idea of love they got from a
movie. This conundrum may cause us to

think Ephron is telling us we’ve all seen
way too many movies, but she’s simply
making us realize how the movies inﬂu-
ence us even when we are unaware of it.

The male characters in Sleepless in
Seattle make fun of An Affair to
Remember by calling it a “chick” movie,
which further blurs Ephron’s line
between the movies and reality, as
Sleepless itself has chick movie inclina-
tions. Ephron also uses this filmic gender

rivalry to bring in subtle reminders of the
perpetual lower status of women in the
movies and otherwise. At Annie’s office,
a mixed gender group argues statistics a
la Susan Faludi’s “Backlash.” In one
scene‘ where Jonah tries to convince his
father to ﬂy to New York to meet Annie,
he responds with “Have you seen Fatal
Attraction? The woman could be a crazy,
sick lunatic.” It’s a funny line, but

Local band Bone gi

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staﬂ Writer

The road to Mike Shanley’s house is hemmed with
warehouses and abandoned fenced-in lots interspersed
with homes.

You almost expect to see tumbleweed roll across the
street like some back lot of an old movie set. It seems
appropriate that Shanley’s neighborhood is just as
diverse and eclectic as his band, Bone of
Contention.

The band, which formed in 1986, just completed its
third release, "Stay Calm." The'Cl) plays host to so
many musical styles that it is virtually impossible to cat-
egorize the band’s sound.

This is probably due to the fact that each member of
the band contributes to the songwriting process. Band
members also switch instruments as frequently as it
rains for the Three Rivers Arts Festival, causing a fluctu-
ation in musical styles that sometimes gets you thinking
that you’re listening to a compilation album of three or
four different bands instead of just one.

Shanley, who plays bass, builds on the static, fuzzy,
monotone rantings reminiscent of post-punk bands of
the early 80s. Lila Shaara, the band’s rhythm guitarist,
contributes haunting, pretty vocals to the dark tales she
weaves.

Barb Madaus pounds the skins and gives a folksy nod
to all of her material while guitarist Bart Wise rounds
out the band and writes instrumentals.

Although BOC is a relatively equal creative effort,
Shanley and Shaara are responsible for most of the lyri-
cal material on “Stay Calm.”

The release has mainly two gears musically and it
seems to shift almost incessantly. The richest material
comes from Shaara. Her lyrical ability comes through in

__ V Y”! ». . 3" ' - ~» ..

 

Shaara, Barb Madaus and Bart Wise.

songs like the country-tinged Smoke and her collabora-
tion with Shanley, In tbe High Valley. The quasi-
bluesy Well Do Fine, which almost sounds like it could
be a Come song, is a fine example of relationships gone
awry in our culture with lyrics about dressing black and
thinking thin. She sings, “You bring the Prozac, I’ll
bring the wine.”

An anthropologist by day, Shaara’s used to analyzing

ves us something to chew on

culture. “Because it’s my job to look at culture, maybe I
think about it a little more. One thing I’ve gotten more
sensitive to is the depiction of females in the media -
especially in beer commercials.‘ I’ve always considered
myself a feminist in that I’m a rational human being. It
doesn’t make sense to be mean to people because
they’re black or female just like it doesn’t make sense to
beat up a two year old for being a two year old.’.’

That feminist sensibility shines through on Madaus’
Feeling Fade, a song which chronicles women in abu-
sive relationships and In the High Valley in which
Shaara sings bluntly about menstruation. Both list Patti
Smith as an enormous influence. Smith was also a big
influence on Shanley, although he also cites bands like
Scrawl, Salem 66 and The Minutemen. Guitarist liart
\Wise admits to more of a blues background and fondly
reflects on its early years when people just hung out on
the front porch and jammed. It was a simpler time
when the music business was more music and less
business and commodity.

Most of the songs on “Stay Calm” stem from everyday
occurences like Shanley’s Codger, a song sting from the
perspective of a grumpy old man. Shanley says, “The
chorus is pretty much taken from a conversation I
heard between two old men riding on the 54C lbusl.”
He sings, “This school don’t teach kids how to read, it
only trains them to be cons.”

Madaus says, “We’re not a band that sings about cars
and girls.” Because the band members have careers
divorced from the band, they bring their outside life
experience into their music.

She continues, “When you’re thirty years old and all
you’ve done is live in a van and hang out in bars, what
do you write songs about? Because of the-lives we lead,
our songs are much better because they deal with

In the quest for suckerpunch
pop, let us not forget that some
often overlook “all—girl" rock
revues, deeming them unwor-
thy of anything except cuteness,
schtick and dainty diatribes.
\V'hile I‘ll remain silent when
the moment pertains to the
philosophies of Riot Girls. it
seems that these revolutionary
girls produce excellent. instinct-
based pop. Harkening back to
the unobtrusive and unprickly
buzz of some Brit-pop outfits,
Sacramentos Tiger Trap cele-
_brate their pig—tailed awkward-
ness with jangly buzz and just
enough punk rock to sufficient-
ly coax and cage sensitive,
young and hormonal tigers.
This girly—girl revue resembles
girlfriends, Bratmobile and K
labelmates, Heavenly as they all
exude the same sort of semi-
believable innocence. As with
its couple of 7”s released on
Olympia’s K records, Tiger
Trap/‘s new full length Tiger
Trap LP will appeal to those
who appreciate hummable bub-
ble—gum rock. In “Supercrush,”
“My Broken Heart" and

The game was in sudden-
death overtime yesterday at
Fitzgerald Field House. Jeff
“Montross” had the ball out on
the wing. He bulled his way in
toward the goal, muscled past
two defenders and skillfully
tossed in the winning shot.

“Montross” pumped his fists
in a manner that expressed the
joy of sweet victory. His team-
mates screamed a chorus of
“yeahs” and gathered around to
exchange high fives with the
hero of the moment.

The entire game had been a
display of skill for "Montross”
who scored on a number of dri-
ving layups and rejected at least
two of his opponents shots.
Syracuse had managed a daring
four-point rally —— while
“Montross” rested on the bench
— and tied the score in the ﬁnal
three minutes of regulation
before the backbreaking shot in
OT.

The final score of this colossal
match was ~ Villanova-27,
Syracuse-25.

W/oeelin’ and deozlin marks boc/eey summer

By Jim Clark
Staff Writer

It’s that time of year again hockey fans:
the time of the year when the champi-
onships have been won and the players are
resting comfortably on the golf courses. All
is peaceful if you’re in the National Hockey
League during the summer.

Unless you’re a general manager.

With the expansion draft looming its ugly
head this week, followed by this weekend’s
entry draft, NHL general managers are in a
frenzy figuring out the base composition of
their respective clubs: who to protect, who
to draft, who to hire as coach, etc.

This past weekend saw a ﬂurry of deals
involving prominent goaltenders. Quebec
netminder Ron Hextall was dealt to the
Islanders in exchange for goalie Mark
Fitzpatrick. These two teams swapped first-
round draft choices to complete the deal.

The long-awaited trade of a goalie in the
Big Apple finally happened with former
Vezina Trophy winner John Vanbiesbrouck
heading north to Vancouver for future con-
siderations.

And two all-star goalies, who should have
never been in an all—star game, were traded

for each other as Ottawa sent Peter
Sidorkiewicz and future considerations to
New Jersey in exchange for Craig Billington
and left wing Troy Mallette.

-Don’t be surprised if Tom Barrasso is
not the goalie in Pittsburgh two years from
now.

The Penguins have a goalie in junior
hockey named Philippe DeRouville, who
scouts compare to Montreal great Patrick
Roy.

In fact, playing in the same league that

‘Roy played his junior hockey, DeRouville

has posted much better numbers than the
monstrous Habs’ keeper.

A deal involving Barrasso would follow
the trend of trading an experienced all—star
goalie while a younger goalie waits in the
wings. Toronto dealt Grant Fuhr and has
been much better off with all—rookie team
selection Felix Potvin in the nets.

And expect Ed Belfour to be elsewhere at
the start of next season, while Jimmy Waite
finally gets his chance to be a number-one
goahe.

-Eddie Johnston WILL be the Penguins
coach next season.

-Markus Naslund, the Pens’ first—round
choice from a few season ago, is suing the

NHL over its free—agent rules. Naslund has
until June 30 to sign with any team he
wants.

The Pens have a right to match any offer
he receives. If Naslund isn’t signed by June
30, he’s not allowed to play in the NHL next
season because he’s a European..

I wish Naslund luck in his suit because
this is a blatant case of discrimination that
allows North Americans to sign almost at
will while Europeans have to be signed dur-
ing a certain time frame.

°You read it here first: Markus Naslund
will be as good as 1993 NHL Rookie of the
Year Teemu Selanne.

°Jaromir Jagr will never be a 50—goal
scorer on any team in the NHL. Even

though it would upset teenage “Penguin '

groupies” everywhere, Jagr should be dealt.
His name alone will get the Penguins more
in return than he’s worth.

-With Scotty Bowman now in Detroit, I
give Paul Coffey until March before he is
dealt.

I don't think the hall of fame defenseman
is looking forward (literally) to playing any
more left wing (as you may remember,
Bowman played Coffey at left wing just
before the Penguins dealt him in 1992).

Williams
reaches

semi’s at
Mobil's

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

Last week, the nation’s
best track-and-field per-
formers came together to
compete in the U.S./Mobil
One National Track and
Field championships in
Eugene, Ore.

Allison Williams, a for-
mer Pitt All-American
who will go down in his-
tory as the most success-
ful female hurdler to don
a University of Pittsburgh
uniform, was one of of
those national bests —
placing among the top 18
competitors in the
nation’s 100-meter hur-
dles. _ _

Williams, whose track
resume includes numer-
ous athlete-of-the—meet
awards, faced her stiffest
competition ever and fin-
ished seventh in the semi-
finals of the event.

Contenders in the 100-
meter hurdles included
American record-holder
Gail Devers (12.48 sec-
onds) and meet record-
holder Lynda Tolbert
(12.75 seconds).

The main objective of
the meet was to qualify

-for world championships

in August.

For a while, it looked as
if Williams was on her
way to accomplishing this
feat.

Williams dashed to a
time of 13.46 in the pre-
liminaries, good enough
to move on to the semifi-
nals.

That’s when reality set
in.

Williams suffered the
agony of defeat in the
semifinals, placing sev-
enth in the heat despite a
respectable time of 13.49.
With that finish, her
dream of running in this
year’s world champi-
onships came to an
abrupt end.

For Williams, her efforts
over the weekend will
hopefully result in a roster
position on the United
States teams heading to
either the World
University Games or the
Pan American Games.

At press time, Williams
had yet to hear of her
qualifying status.

“I really don’t know
which team I qualified
for,” Williams said.“I will
find out at the end of this
week.”

THE PITF NEWS, Wedneggz, lune 23, 1993

13

Now that this whole Don
Cherry issue is over and done
with, let me aggravate every
Pittsburgher by dredging up
his name one more time. For
all his ridiculous, off-the-cuff
remarks concerning the way
hockey “should be” played, I
have to agree with him on his
views about expansion.

With the addition of Miami,
Dallas and the Anaheim
Quacks to the NHL’s already-
vast fraternity of cities, the
league now boasts a total of
26 teams — five of which
have been added by expan-
sion over the past two years.
And now, there has even
been talk of possibly adding

1 two more teams for the 1994-
95 season in order to even up
the divisions at seven teams
apiece.

Can you imagine the NHL
with 28 teams? Wasn’t it in
1967 that the league boldly
expanded from six to 12
teams, with Pens, Flyers,
Blues, Kings, North Stars and
now-defunct Oakland Seals
entering the league? Now, just
26 years and countless expan-
sions later, the same league is
targeting toward having as
many‘ teams as does Major
League Baseball. ‘A
‘ In y'é‘ars'”to' come, this rapid
expansion_ couldldo a lot
more harm than good. Why?
Because the nucleus of talent-

,.-enough, to make every team
competitive. .  
‘ Think about it. The NHL
this year was comprised of

,, \one ‘ unstoppable ipowerhouse
-(Pittsburgh), a fewvquality
teams, several, below-average
clubs and too many squads
that looked like a circus
sideshow. Now, the league
wants to add more fodder.

By the time the talent in the

Expansion, Trotts and Walkie

league disperses, the NHL will
be made up of three or four
good teams and a remainder
of bad teams with decent
records. Why? Because the
teams they are playing are just
as bad.

Before too long, NHL
games will be barely as enter-
taining as studio wrestling.

-After David Volek’s slap-
shotslammed into the net
behind Tom Barrasso in over-
time of game seven against
the Islanders, everybody in
Pittsburgh ran to find a possi-
ble scapegoat. Only problem
was, there was none. Not

Barrasso. Not Mario Lemieux.

For all its immense talent,
the Pens did lack one champi-

Walkie’s complete—game
victory over Doc Gooden and
the Mets was just desserts for
the one man in the major
leagues who gets absolutely
no respect for a job done
well.

Case in point: After the
game, Mets manager Dallas
Green refused to acknowl-
edge Walkie’s milestone by
saying that Bob Walk had no
business pitching a complete
game against his team. He
obviously has no idea how
much Walk has meant to the
club over the years.

Since Walk joined the Bucs
from their Hawaii Triple-A
club in 1985, he has continu-
ally been one of the Pirates’
most consistent performers.
Coming into this season, he
had a winning percentage of
.595, and a respectable life-
time ERA of 3.52 with the
Pirates. Still, seemingly the
only people that have ever
given him recognition are his
teammates and Leyland.

well. He nailed down a crucial
jumper from the top of the key
in Villanova’s next game, which
also went into a sudden-death
overtime, to post a 51-29 victory
and a 4-0 record for his team.

Simmons and Wang feel that
they have the strongest team in
their conference, but they’re
afraid that eventually the
Villanova squad will have to be
broken up because it is just too
dominating.

Another game, which — you
guessed it — extended into yet
another sudden-death drama,
demanded heroics of epic pro-
portions yesterday at the Field
House.

In a game reminiscent of the
Michigan-Seton Hall NCAA ﬁnal
in ‘89 where Rumeal Robinson
had to stick two foul shots in
OT to win, Brian Whitworth
(favorite player —— Jalen Rose)
stepped to the line with two
shots to determine the fate of
the Boston College squad.

With the score knotted at 35-
35, Whitworth’s first shot was
slightly long and missed its
mark. Whitworth, 12, made the
second attempt but it was dis-

knocked down the following
shot (his third attempt) and the
jubilation began.

The young men enjoy the
drills and competition of the
camp and think it will help
make them better players.

“lThe camp] keeps you on
your toes,” Whitworth said.
“You sweat a lot.”

Even though the camp is
worthwhile and fun, the boys
do have one gripe which is
something they probably have
in common with their idols:
“Some of the referees are bad.”

CAMP NOTES: Other camps
going on this week include
Lady Panther Basketball Camp
(Trees Hall) and Pitt Panther
Baseball Camp (Trees Field).

Overnight camp for Paul
Evans’ Pitt Panther Basketball
Camp .runs from June 27
through July 2 and again from
July 11 through July 15. Varsity
Team camp also runs from July
11 through July 15. There is
