Rush OK’s
Rec Hall;

Opens Soon

The Student Christian-Federa-
tion will officially open their head-
quarters in the Grace Reformed
Church at 3 o'clock Monday after-
noon.

The last obstacle toward the
use of the Grace Church facilities
was eliminated yesterday when
Helen Pool Rush, dean of women,
representing the University ap-
proved the list of supervisors re-
cruited by the Student Christian
Federation.

Reception Plarmed

A special reception from 3 p.m.
to 5 p.m. will usher in the SCF's
use of the church. The Federation
accprding to Dick Campbell, pre-
sident,.has sent invitations to 75
administrative.» officers of the Uni-
versity, faculty members, and other
interested persons. In addition all
members of the student body are
welcome at the opening.

Monday's opening will mark the
end of several months of planning,
cleaning, and conferring since the
trustees of the Grace church at
Bayard and Dithridge Streets of-
fered an unused wing of the buil-
ding to the Student Christian Fede-.
ration as a headquarters.

Along with the single room gran-
ted the Federation under the terms
of their agreement with the church
are included several other rooms
which the SCF can make avail-
able to other student groups within
the University

Share with Church

Among these other facilities are
a dining, room and kitchen, a game
room, and a reception hall which is
being used for Monday's opening.

The Federation plans to have a
part of these facilities open from
1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday and in the evenings upon

the special request of student
groups. According to the agree-
ment with the trustees of the

church, the SCF will have the use
of the extra facilities only when
they have not previously been pro-
mised to other church groups.

25 Pitt Men

Pitt's 25 man delegation to the
Intercollegiate Conference on Gov-,
ernment will tackle the complex
problem of amending the Pennsyl-

I vania constitution today at the

conference headquarters, The For-
um, in Harrisburg.

ICG is a statewide student organ-
ization which meets once a year in
the state capital and brings stu-
dent representatives from colleges
all over the state together to con-
sider and propose solutions for
problems of a political nature.

Study Constitution i

This year the delegates will study
Pennsylvania's constitution care-
fully then pass mock amendments
where they think they are needed.
Last year the ICG took the form of
a model state legislature where the
delegates passed state laws during
a three-day session.

i Under Chairman Fred Purdy,
Pitt’s delegation will attend thé
conference at the full strength limit
allowed for each school,_ 25 men.
The delegation is divided into 12'
committees, each of which will
cover one phase of the constitution.

Iihe ICG session started on April
13, and will run until April 16.,
Yesterday at preliminary meetings
the convention was organized into
a working body. Today delegates
will elect a chairman to‘ preside
over the conference.

Students Up For Posts

Fred Purdy, chairman of the con-
vention, and Ray Maher, delegate,
are possible Pitt candidates for
the post.

During these two days most of
the work will be done in committee
membership. On Saturday, April 15,‘
conference delegates, will meet
together in a plenary session at
The Forum.

There, the whole convention
will pass on the amendments which
each committee will propose on
the floor.

Louis H. Johnston of the political
science department is the faculty
sponsor of the Pitt ICG.

Independent Movement Evident
As Men’s Elections Approach

Pittis independent political move-

ment, dormant since last year's
elections, is being fanned into
flames again for men’s elections
next Wednesday.

Up until this late date Pitt poli-

tics have been conspicuous for the
absence of both IF and independent
campaigning. At the same time a
year ago, however, the independents

under the leadership of Stu Work-

master already had a well—defined
coalition
proval of Pitt voters.

Council '.‘.lasqueraded
IF Council countered by refusing

to name its slate in advance of the

election, then the day of polling
it sprang its list under the banners
of the “All-Student Party.” The
election turnout totaled over 100
per cent of what it had been the
the previous year and the inde-
pendents captured two senior seats.

This year campus independents
will definitely back their own slate
in
nounce it until late this afternoon.

The independents should have a

hard time ferreting out a Congress
slate from among the 25 eligible
nominees if they plan to .back only

slate ready for the ap-

the elections but will not an-

non-frat men. Only two of the men
are independents, Ben E. Thomas,
seeking a junior spot, and Sandy
Lupovitz, a senior hopeful.

Council Race Easier

In the ranks of the 39 Men's
Council candidates, however, the
independents will have an easier
time selecting a slate, especially
among those running for posts in
the schools of Engineering and’
Mines, Pharmacy, and, perhaps,
Business Administration. These
schools are traditional independent
strongholds.

The Congress race now sees 24
men running for eight vacant seats.
Previously named to run for vacant
senior seats by the Student Con-
gress nominating committee were
Bill Ferguson, Earl ]acob, Dale
Hooper, Phillip B. Zeeller, Jr-.,
Harry E. Lucas, Andy Schurman,
ClintonLowery,and Nat Landerman.

Junior candidates named by the
committee were William McKinley,
Worthington Fowler, Don Horowitz,
Phil Feinert, Richard Shallen-
berger, Dick Harper, Howard Bright,
and Don Carothers.

Eight petitioners have also been

accepted as candidates for the
elections. Senior office-hopefuls
are Richard S. Richards, Sandy

Lupovitz, C. Edward Turek, and
Herman Levy while junior petition-
ers were Ben E. Thomas, Alan
Goldberg, Cyril H. Wecht, and Will-

iam E. Green.

IF Plans Unkown

No indication has been received
yet as to what course of action IF
Council plans to take in lining up
its own slate. The Council meets
oin Sunday evening at which time
it will probably decide its slate.
Whether or not its selections will
be publicized-before election time
this year is not known.

All indications point, however,
to an easy IF victory in usual
fashion.

1n the Men’s Council race a field
of 71 petitioners has been narrowed"
down to 39 candidates whose names
will be placed on the ballot. Last
year; the IF slate swept through the
Council battle without losing a
single seat to the independents
who did not seriously contest the
MC battle.

Courts Only Hope

The only way open for Sigma Chi
to lease the building now is
through the civil courts or the
Pittsburgh city council. In order
for the frat to continue action in
this way, says Vermeire, it is es-
sential that -Mr. and Mrs. Valli re-
main willing in the face of their I
neighbors’ opposition to allow the
fraternity to move in.

At present the Vallis are plan-
ning to occupy the building them-
selves st some future date. There-
fore, they would be reluctant to in-
cur the unfriendliness of Dithridge

Check Your Facts, McKowen

"Sounding Off” is great exercise for the lungs so long as you

don't have “dirt on your own doormat” and it doesn't bounce back

in your fac’e.When, with dirt behind your own ears, you start fling-

ing careless, libelous charges at another writer without a little
wfact-checking, you're bound to get it blown back at you.

That's precisely what Panther Editor Bob McKowen left him-
self open to in his "All Fools Issue” editorial last week.

While keeping alive a senseless civil war between the Pan-
ther and News by "simply attempting to defend our honor and half
the University's as well,” McKowen, apparently smarting from

_News Copy Editor Al Gioia’s criticism of the previous Panther,

leveled a completely false yet serious charge accusing Gioia of
plagiarism in the aforementioned column of criticism.

***

=|I**

Refering to a satire on the movie, "Samson and Delilah,” a

V column written by a member of his own staff, Al Stein, McKowen

accused Gioia of stealing it, substituting the ,word "Panther”

it into the News.

a each place the words “Samson and Delilah” appeared, and getting

'It’s a matter of provable fact that Stein submitted the column

W ‘to us for publication, which we‘ decided against, and that a com-
 parison of Steir; and Gioia’s articles show that, besides a simil-

arity in style, McKowen’s charge is a total lie. We have both
columns available and we welcome their inspection.

McKowen, it seems, was particularly unwise in printing such

it an unfounded charge of plagiarism, when his own cupboard is so
, messy with that very thing. He claimed it wasn't in the same edit-

orial, pointing to the previous issue and saying,

“Mr._Gioia, or someone else, will be pleased to know that

W 1 excluding the Campus Candids in our last issue, the rest of the

pictures were taken by two of our very able photographers.”

**,=|| ‘

***

While it is no doubt true that most of the pictures were taken

' by their. own photographers in the “All Fools Issue,” the Panther

was again, as it has been most of the year guilty of its own little

C version of the art of plagiarism having their own staff members

and girl"! friends in many of the pictures they pass off /as repre-
senting the student body in some form or another.

Our own count shows that a dozen of the half-hu::dred pictures
in the April edition were of Panther staffers, another two of a girl
friend of one of the Panther men, not counting the ostrich and
monkey, both of which may or may not have been Panther staffers.
Then, of course, they "lift” without permission in most cases

the pictures, they twist around for the "Campus Candids” page.

As for throwing charges of plain plagiarism around, itis in-
teresting to note that the Panther was cut off the exchange list
ofthe campus magazine of Duke University. That magazine wrote

**=|I

“them, stating that the Panther had stolen one of its cartoons,
*  signed the name of one of the Panther artists to it, and run it.

**#I

The rest of the Panther’s "I do not wish to make a great noise
of this affair” attack on the News falls mostly under the category
of "local” jokes (the kind that relate only to a handful of people
and are not expected to be appreciated by many outsiders).

If the Panther staff thinks that material was funny, okay. If
the readers liked it and laughed at it, the Panther should print
more of it. Far be it from us to object to being made the butt of a

joke, so long as it is a joke. Nor do we deny

the Panther

the right to criticize. But they certainly ought to clean up their
own household before they blast others for dregs they themselves

live in.

We have noted, with considerable
interest, the recent election plans
for Student Congress and Men’s
Council. The question is -- are the
students of the University going to

submit to the same type of leader-

ship which we have had recently?

For instance, are we going to
have some more of the petty squab-
bles and personal feuds which have
filled the meetings of Student Con-
gress and Men’s Council during the

While the football team is in

start thinking about next year’s

nection is:

"Should Pitt have women cheer-

"You've got to admit they are
prettier than men.”

Fred Purdy, College 50: "It’s
fine in the aesthetic sense, but
not in the practical. Women’s__A in-
herent cattiness would rear its ugly
head. You’d hear, ‘There are lots
of girls in our sorority prettier than
that hag.”’

Serge Paris, Engr. 51: “There is
a definite need for mixed cheer-
leaders and new cheers. Girls are
usually more original and aggresive
in introducing new material.”

Peggy Davis, College 50: "This
is _a coeducational school. Girls
participate in other activities, why
should the line be drawn at cheer-
leading?”

Betty Lou Fennell, Ed. 51: "I
think women tend to be more neg-
ligent and would not appear at all
rallies and practices.”

Ed Murphy, College 52: “It
would help. Girls get more emo-
tional over little things and would
cheer more spontaneously.”

only way the students have to
learn of their so-called law-makers’
activities -- instead of arriving at
some constructive legislation?

It seems that what this school
needs is more of a two-party sys-
tem. Is the newly formed Pitt ‘In-
dependent Association going to let
this golden opportunity to fill a
much needed function pass by?
After all, a good two-party system
would surely bring about a better
selection of qandidates than we
have had in thelpast. -

At the same time, we find it hard
to believe that all of the fraterni-
ties are in accord with therantics
of their representatives. We do not
believe in the policy of "guilt by
association,” but it seems that
the fraternities have allowed them-
selves to be maneuvered into a
situationwhere a few leaders have
caused most students to wonder
if this past year’s leadership is
the best the fraternities have to
offer.

We feel that these evils can be
corrected and are ready to go out
and really work for some different
faces in Congress.

Vets Again

By‘DICK KOVAR

Pitt News Managing Editor

 

There are an awful lot of morons at Pitt.

This charge, hurled quite often in bull sessions by those who
maintain that anyone who goes to class regularly and turns in
papers and examinations with.little more than his name on it can
graduate with straight A's from the University, can now be estab-

lished as fact.

The basis for this statement,

,,which will undoubtedly bring Dr.

Bowman screaming from retirement
and cause ashake-up from the Board
of Trustees clear down to the Tuck
Shop busboy staff, is the reaction
of an astonishing number of so-
called scholars to an article printed
on this page the day before All
Fools Day.

Humor Too Broad

When submitted, the article was
criticized by several News staff
members as not being subtle enough.
Judging from the comments of some
outraged readers, anything written
in words of more than one syllable
is too subtle for their minds.

The April Fool article, lampoon-
ing an earlier column written by
the same author on the same sub-
ject, listed a string of ridiculous
reasons for a ridiculous statement
on the general subject of veteran
students.

The initial article, admittedly,
was hastily written and was further
confused by the mixing-up of several
paragraphs when the page was made
-up. What honest conclusions were
made were completely lost in the
paragraph switch, while some half-
baked notions were set down with-
out too much thought.

Humor Too Subtle

Its satiric successor, however,
was deliberately intended to be

senseless. As it turned. out, it
was taken even more seriously than
the first, in spite of the fact that
a bold-face article
above it pointed out that the entire
page had been devoted to material
in keeping with a certain tradition
associated with the firstday of
April. A

The author is not vindictive- or
sore about the lack of humor and
insight found among his critics;
he is merely alarmed at the mental-
ity of these examples of the modern
Pitt student.
‘ Therefore, for their benefit, the
following statement has been set
down, with careful attention to
clarity and simplicity.

Humor?

1 do not hate vets. Vets are just
as nice as non-vets. Most of my
friends are vets. Vets earned the
right to be helped through school
by giving up years of their life,
and often their lives, in the late
war. The story you read on March 31
was a joke. An April Fool joke,
that is. Please do not be frightened
by it.

Although there are five two-syll-
ablsr words and one hyphenation iri
the above, enough of it should be
clear to get it over to just about
everyone-.

Now maybe I can go back to my
Poli. Sci. class and try to make a
better grade than the vet who sits
next‘ [0 me.

Spirited EC Elections

Bring Record Turnout

  

By DAVE WINTER
The elections hullaballo is over at Ellsworth Center. A 12-man
political clique and two "outsiders" were chosen Wednesday,
April 5, for seats on the EC Student Council.

The hectic pre-election publicity
campaign brought a record tum-
out of 362 voters, approximately 80
per cent of the students attending
classes on election day.

Bob Gergins, who had more pos-
ters in more places than anyone
else, and Al Johnson, who was for-
tunate enough to draw first place
on the ballot, led the clique of 12
students elected to a man.

Three vets, Ed Rosiak, Danny
Gardner, and Bill John, were among
the successful candidates. John
squeezed by 15th place Bob Magill
with only a two-vote margin.

Individual vote totals: Robert
Gergins 273, Edward Rosiak 261,
Albert Johnson 246, Pat Airhart
225, Daniel Gardner 217, Jack
Burwinkel 193, James Adams 191,
Don Sharapan 183, Stanley Gross
181, James Black 180, Alan Lef-
kowitz 178, Eugene Rock 176,
Hayy Anderson 158, William John
154. _,

Handbills 8 F3¢t0|'

The strong support given to the
Gergins-Johnson crowd can prob-
ably be attributed to the handbills
listing their names which were
given to each voter on his way to
the polls. Students were seen mar-
king names familiar to them and
then consulting the handbill to fill
out their 14 choices.

Rosiak, a very tall vet who looks
like good basketball material,
booﬁted himself into second place
in the vote totals by button-holing
students on their way to lunch and
escorting them personally to the
polls.

Social Events Wanted

Jack Burwinkelts promises for
more and better social events and
his familiar name probably were
factors in his winning a seat. Jack
is a younger brother of Larry Bur-
winkel, Student Congress president
last year. ”

The 14 newly-elected represen-

tatives are scheduled to meet twice
during April with the out-going
Council for orientation. Their term
of office begins May 1, and at the

Prof Writes
Of Mexico

Erupting volcanoes, wedding
cake churches, and rock bottom

prices are a few of the interesting
things Robert D. Ayars, accounting
professor, is encountering in
Mexico.

Mr. Ayars has been on leaveof
absence from the University since

the summer of 1949, and has spent

most of it there.

On a side trip he visited Para-
cutin, the world's only active vol-
cano. He writes back of the ex-
treme desolation of the surrounding
countryside, and the boulder-
spewing mountain that lights the
the night sky with its red hot lava.

A cathedral near Tlaxcala he
describes as "a pink and white
wedding cake.” It is one of the
few churches in Mexico which was
not defaced during the Revolution.

Mexican prices, however, are
about the most interesting to Mr.
Ayars. According to his list, a
shoeshine is four cents, oranges
nine to twelve cents a dozen, and
streetcar fare two cents.

Other prices are; cigarettes, five
and a half cents a package, manit
cure, twenty five cents, and an
excellent dinner, eighty five cents
to one dollar and twenty five cents.

In between trips, Ayars is
working on an accounting text. He
expects to return to Pitt for the
fall semester.

SC Pre-»Vacati0n Meeting

Student Congress spent most of
the pre-vacation meeting talking
about something it could do nothing
about.

The main discussion centered on
allowing handbills to be distributed
to the line waiting to register to
vote on‘ April 19.

A University ruling prohibits the
distribution of handbills in the
Commons Room, the site of men's
elections. '

Ray Maher threatened to move
that the elections be held in some
other place "if we can’t hand out
handbills in the Commons Room.”
The threat was never carried out.

Maher called the condition a
"handicap.”

Clinton Lowery moved that cam-
paigning not be allowed in the
polling area and in the line waiting
to vote.

The deletion of the "line waiting

Discusses Campaign Rules

to vote” was moved by Don Ewart.

Lowery withdrew his motion. He
stated, however, that the election
committee would define polling
area to include the line waiting to
vote. Parliamentary law forbids
campaigning in the polling area so
the actual spirit of Lowery’s ori-
ginal motion will be accomplished.

pastime, of 20 year's duration, has resulted in the 50,000 tree evergreen

Dr. H. C. Carlson leaned forward
in his swivel chair, smiling as he
said, "They work all the time,never
talk back, and are always there.”
Could this be some phenomenal vari-
ety of basketball player? No, he
was merely discussing his favorite
pastime, growing evergreens.

Well-known as chief male medico
an'd demonstrative basketball coach
at the University, Doc Carlson has
been enthused with his hobby for the
last 20 years. Comparing himself to
an auto which can’t pass a gasoline
station, he claims that he "can’t
pass a nursery without stopping to
make a purchase.”

Heads For Hills

Week-ends and holidays the doc-
tor heads for the Ligonier hills and
his 30 acres of picturesque country-
side. Not the least of the surround-
ing beauty are his 50,000evergreens,
many of which were bought from the
state for the purpose of reforestation
and flood control.

Strolling along the terraces, look-
ing up from the fish pond or gazing
across the hillsides from the chil-
dren’s swimming pool, a visitor
could see his hemlocks, blue Spruce,
Juniper pfitzers, and holly trees.

“Did you know holly grew on
trees?” Carlson queried, as he proud-

ly pulled a colored negative out of.

his wallet and held it up to the light.
It was a picture of one of his prize
holly trees. “Those white stems
look like new kid gloves in a box,”
he commented.

There he was amazed by a holly tree

Grad Exam

Graduating seniors spent most of
this week with agonized and tired
faces, and after today will have a
chance to recuperate from the an-
nual guantlet of the Graduate Re-
cord exams.

Dr. George L. Fahey, associate
professor of psychology, is in
charge of the exam this year. The
department will send each student
a report of scores after about four
weeks. ,_

For this purpose, students were
advised to bring self-addressed,
stamped envelopes with them to
the banquet hall of Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial hall where the
exams were given.

According to the psychology de-
partment, the exams will have no
effect on the grades of the students
taking them, but are a requirement
for graduation.

Results of the tests are kept by
the psychology department and may
not be examined except with the
student concerned.

Team Travels to Thiel

The Panthers, partakers of bruising Southern hospitality during the

that beat the Panthers, 7-2. Leonard
Schiff, Whitney Dillon, and Guy Blair
all played in last season’s contest.
Schiff will probably meet Johnny
Lohstoeter, Panther No. 1 man, in
the feature contest of the match.

John Tough on State

Big ]ohn,starting his second year
on the racquet team, lost only one
match in his sophomore year. And at
Ohio State he won the lone Pitt point
in singles play and teamed up with
Stan Weil in the doubles to capture
the, other Panther marker.

Besides Lohstoeter, Dr. O’Lough-

lin will call on Harry Campney, ace
sophomore from Avalon, letterman

fer student from Carnegie Tech. The
other two positions are‘ still open
with Al Margus and Bob Ilisevich
probably having the best chance of
seeing action against the Buckeyes.

Fun Frolic

Women’s Athletic Association
will hold its monthly “Fun Frolic
Nite” Thursday. All women are
welcome to join in the activities
planned for sport-minded fems.

Those girls who wish to exer-
cise, play volleyball, badminton,
basketball, ping-pong, or just have
an all—around good time should
stop by Cathedral Gym at 7:30 p.m.

Meanwhile, after more than a
month of tournament ping-pong,

Genevieve Gates and Joan Cudde-.

back emerged as finalists in the
WAA sponsored tournament. Be-
causegof a broken finger suffered
by Miss Cuddeback, however, the
IX/AA has decided to give the title
of champ to both girls.

 

3}’ DON MURDOCK

Ralph Mitterling will probably
drool over a certain baseball player
coming to Pitt, but the coach will
have to take a hands-off attitude to-
ward him.

He will be passing up the best
baseball player ever to enroll at
the University, but he has no
choice. Unfortunately, Cliff
Chambers is a professional.

The 28-year-old baseball star,
who pitches for the Pittsburgh Pi-
rates, will enroll herein the fall
for the sole purpose of furthering
his education».

To Work on Masters

Cliff will receive his Bachelor
of Science degree in physical edu-
cation at Washington State Col-
lege in June and will work on his
masters degree in physical educa-
tion at Pitt.

The 6-1, 208 pound athlete at-
tended Washington Scare for four
years before the war but entered
military service before he could
complete his senior year. He fini-
shed his schooling at Washington
State this past winter.

"I am intending on living with
my family while attending school
(Pitt) and will make Pittsburgh my
year-around home for a few years,”
says Cliff.

Hears Good Things

“I had a talk last week with the
head of the department of physical
education at Washington State, and
he informed me that‘Pitt had a good
physical education department. The
reporters with the baseball club»
tell me Pitt is expanding its physi-
facilities.” ‘

cal
Aside from the above, Cliff
knows nothing about Pitt except

what he has seen walking from the
Webster Hall Hotel to the ball
park, but he intends to find out a
lot more in the very near future.

He w,ill_take only the fall semes-
ter at Pitt so there will be no con-
flict with school and spring
training.

On Lecture Program

B)’ JACK MARKOWITZ
Richard Llewellyn, who will speak here next week under the
auspices of the University Lecture Series, is best known as the
author of "How Green Was My Valley” and "None But the Lonely

Heart.”

The fact that the two novels are laid in completely different

surroundings, the Welsh coal-
mining district of the late nine-
teenth century and the London
slums of fifteen years ago, attests
to the author's wide experience.
Welsh Miners Described

“How Green Was My Valley” de-
scribes the growing up of Huw
Morgan, a son and brother of coal
miners, and, through his eyes, a
picture of the strong, humble men
and women who were the Welsh
miners and their wives.

.‘.Ir. Llewellyn gives an interes-
ting, admirable picture of these
little-known people. Their most
outstanding quality is strength of
character. In all their actions, in
family relations, in the way they
enforce law‘ without the aid of pol-
ice, sin their austerity during a
seven-months strike, they prove
their character. ,

A very different kind of people
is described in Mr. Llewellyn’s
second book. ’ ' '

In "None But the Lonely Heart
the author takes the reader to the
sordidness of the London slums,
where lives Mr. Ernest Verdun
Mott.

7’!

Pathetic Hero

Ernie is a pathetic fellow if ever
there was one. His biggest trouble
is that he has no sense of values.

At the beginning of the book, he
is trying to make himself believe
that he has talent in art, and he
allbwsvhis mother to support him
while he goes half-heartedly to an

art school for five years.

Shortly after being expelled, he
admits to himself that after all he
was wasting time. He starts to
help his mother out in her store,
and for a few days it looks as if he
is on the right track at last.

But Ernie chances to meet a
certain admired racketeer who im-
presses him with stories of the
great amount of money to be made
by breaking into stores. And so he
becomes a crook.

Not one thought does he give to
a question of right or wrong. All
that matters is the money and con-
sequently the power to be gained

Rut Ernie has some redeeming
characteristics, too. Actually he
is only dissatisfied and searching
for a way to live. "None But the
Lonely lleart” is a human, under-
standing tale and gives an indica-
tion of the kind of man Richard
Llewellyn must be to have written

Plight Poor

With the advent of the baseball
season, Pitt students who drive to
school will find the parking situa-
tion getting worse before it gets
better.

An agreement made three years
ago between University officials
and the Pittsburgh Police called
for lining off the Schenley parking
area. This was done to make as
much space as possible available
iwithout blocking any cars in the
or.

The days on which baseball
games are scheduled in Forbes
Field, however, were made excep-
tions. Vehicles were to be per-
mitted to park bumper-to-bumper on
those days. This was to alleviate
overload parking on the Oakland
streets.

Students, therefore, have two
alternatives. They can box them-
selves in and wait out the games
in marooned cars. The solution is
for daytime parkers to remove their
automobiles before the fans start
filling up parking lanes.

According ‘to Lt. John Neary, of
the Pittsburgh Police Department,
car owners have found it advisable
to move their cars by 12 noon.

Emotional

Factor Cited

As Causes ofHeadaehes

By RAY CRISTINA
A severe headache often results when a person "takes out
on himself” the suppressed anger or resentment he feels against

others.
Dr. James T. McLaughlin,

Staunton assistant professor of

psychiatry at Pitt, discussed the "large number of emotional fac-

tors involved in headaches before
a group of physicians at Western
Psychiatric, Institute last week.

Tension A Cause

"One way headaches are
caused,” he explained, “is by the
expansion and contraction of blood
vessels in the brain and its co-
vering and by muscular tension in
those muscles connected to the
skull.” Such tension states as
clenched jaws and taut neck mus-
cles can lead to headaches, he
said.

"Contrary to popular opinion,”
the Pitt psychiatrist stated, "it is

often not eyestrain but the emotio-
nal conflicts of poor eyesight
which produce headaches.” In the
same way, he added, the emotional
factors and not the physical mani-
festations of constipation are the
source of headaches.

Migraine, a severe and periodic
headache, is especially prevalent
in women--three to every man.
"An over-emphasis on intellectual
competition and achievement is
frequently seen in a person with
migraine,” Dr. McLaughlin said.

Responsibility Too Much
On the other hand, a heavy, un-
wanted responsibility may induce
forced release through migraine.

Clinical findings have shown that

usually forgotten afterward.”

nerve centers.

"The epilepsy pattern,” the
Doctor said, "seems to be in-
herent and has existed down
through the ages as a primitive
method of draining off tensions."
But only in those individuals who
have a faulty control of the nerve
impulses in the brain can the pat-
tern be seen in the form of epi-
lepsy. _
' Epilepsy Prevalent

Everyone experiences minor
forms of the epilepsy pattern, he
added. "The sleep start, accom-
panied with unpleasant emotional
impressions, represents a massive
discharge of tension related to
epilepsy.”

He gave as other examples of
this type a violentdisplay of tem-
per, or'simply momentary lapses
of attention.

In real epileptics, psychotherapy
can help a greatdeal by reducing
the number of attacks, Dr. Mc
Laughlin said.

The YM and YWCA will combine
for a mixer dance on Friday, April
14, from 2 p.m. to S p.m. in room

Besides dancing there will be

but everybody is welcome.

New Execs
'‘'Up’ Today

The University Publications
i3oard convenes this afternoon at
3:30 to fill the executive chairs
of the major campus publications
for next year.

Announcement of the board's six
selections will be made in Tues-
day's News.

Named Early

Following a procedure installed
last year, the naming of the editors
and business managers of the
News, Owl, and Panther is made
in April so that the new publica-
tions heads can begin to familia-
rize themselves with their jobs
prior to the end of the semester.

The 19-member panel will hear
reports of the executive committees
of each of the three publications,
then make its selections. The exe-
cutive committees interviewed the
applicants for the various posts
within the last two weeks.

Biddle Heads Iloard »

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, is chairman of the board
which includes four other Univer-
sity administrators, five faculty
members, the present editors and
business managers of the three
publications, and three student
delegates, one from each of the
three campus student governing
bodies. ‘
