\ “Fifth Hour To Be

Free‘Activity Hour

Ofﬁcials have announced that ,a
change in class scheduling will al-
low more time for activities in
which‘ all University students and
faculty. may participate.

Dr. Charles Peake, assistant
chancellor for student affairs,
and Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the faculties, have“ an-
nounced that beginning with the
fall semester of 1957, the ﬁfth
hour, from 12:30 to 1:30, p.m.
will be reserved for general stu-

~* dent and faculty use.

The period will be used for lec-
tures, assemblies, convocations,
luncheons, and other group meet-
ings. .

Construction of Engineering
Hall and of Clapp Hall, along
with the anticipated move of
many units from the Cathedral
to the Schenley area, will make
the classroom less severe than
it has been in recent years, and
will make the schedule change
possible.

Dr. Peake said that the provis-
ion of new dining, lounging, and
conference facilities in the Schen-
ley area, along with the develop-
ment of important student pro-
grams, assure proﬁtable use of the

. class free period.

The scheduling restores an
earlier practice which had to be
abandoned after World War II be-
cause of crowded conditions.

  

. CARNIVAL—Miss Metropolitan, the queen for
the 1957 Spring Festival will be selected by ,
the full-time undergraduate student body from
this group. The voting ‘will take place tomor-
row from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Pictured above

  

are:

 Archeologistsilllan
Florida Expedition  

 

   

This summer, Dr. William E. Edwards, assistant pro-
fessor of anthropology, will lead a ten-week expedition to
L train students in techniques of archaeological ﬁeld research.

The third Pitt program of its kind, the project will be
conducted in several areas of Florida relatively unknown,

archaelogically.

Offered to both men and women¢

students, the program requires no

~‘:“

previous study courses. The only
requirements are a genuine inter-
est in primitive cultures and in
archeology and an academic av-
erage of C plus or better in prev-
ious work.
Equipment Supplied
All special equipment and sup-

,-plies for the ﬁeld work will be
*supplied by the University, The

ﬁeld research will be offered from
July 1 to Sept. 7. Students may
stay the entire ten. weeks or for
periods as brief as two weks.
Sessions will be subdivided
into graduate and underrraduate
courses, Sociology 251 and So-
ciology 85, Field Research in
Anthropology. One credit per
.week will be earned.

iField work will emphasize

. study of the “Early Hunters,” the

ﬁrst Floridians, who lived primar-

ily by hunting big game they
helped to make extinct: mam-
moths, rnastodons, camels, giant
ground sloths, and saber-toothed
tigers. These‘ animals and the hu-

’mans who depended upon them

i x

l

disappeared about 4000 B.C.

Excavate Sites
‘ Although concentration will be
on Early Man, some time will be
spent excavating sites of later
shell-ﬁsh collecting Indians as
well as several sites concerning
the more recent farming Indians.

Located three years ago but not
yet excavated was one such site,
a shell mound ofeabout 500 B.C.
This site, which includes an Ind-
ian burial ground, will be partial-
ly excavated this summer.

The Florida research ‘trip is
designed to give students prac-
tical experience in locating
archaeological sites, mapping,
excavating, photographing, pre-
serving’ and cataloging of speci-
mens.

Equally important and of more
general applications, since most
of the students will not be plan-
ning careers in arthropology, will
be the opportunity for students to
participate in every phase of a
signiﬁcant scientiﬁc project.

Analyze Data

Those phases include learning
how to formulate a scientiﬁc pro-
blem, how to gather and analyze
relevant data, and how to write
up the results of ﬁeld research.

To give purpose and direction
to the investigation, supervised
ﬁeld work will be supplemented
by lectures on Indian cultures and
the theory underlying methods
employed in the ﬁeld research.

Those interested in other
ﬁelds such as botany, zoology,

opportunity to pursue such re-

Of the ten previous seasons of
archaeological ﬁeld work which
Dr. Edwards has conducted, ﬁve
have been concerned with study-
ing the earliest Floridians. He
concentrated on them because
those primitive people.- occupied
eastern North America for the
ﬁrst three—quarters of human his-
tory on this continent.
Abundance of Sites
Historical evidence for these
people outside Florida is known
from only a few camp sites. But in
Florida, there is_ a remarkable

abundance of such sites, repre-
senting many primitive civiliza-
tions‘.

On Pitt’s two previous sum-
mers’ expeditions, about 100 sites
were discovered“ Several of the?

 Free I-'iItI1

Only once before this coming fall since before World
War II has the administration approved a free ﬁfth hour for
the University. That was in the school year 1954-55. Accord-
ing to the Pitt News for October 8, 1954, “Student reaction
to this ruling (free ﬁfth hour) has been sharply critical since

. the immediate result has been congestion on the ground

ﬂoor, in the tuck shops, and at other points where students
gather.” ~

, The administration has guaranteed that such conges-
tion can be eliminated as a deterrent to the success of the
free ﬁfth hour in this coming year. The facilities of the Un-
ion and the modern, spacious cafeteria are to be available
to student and faculty use by September.,So the problem of
eating space is solved.

But a more serious problem_confronts the administra-'

tors who advocate a free ﬁfth hour. The purpose of the free
time is the -same this year as itwas in 1954; to provide time
for organizations to sponsor informal luncheon meetings and
other gatherings to discuss problems and hear outstanding
speakers in their ﬁeld. Previously, the ROTC departments
held drill during the free hour, professors held make—up ex-

‘ ams, fraternities made money on house lunches and many,

many other violations of this purpose were committed by
both students and faculty.

N 0, Dr. Peake and company, a lesson’ should be learned
about our student body from the very disappointing attend-
ance at the valuable (and expensive), Scholars’ Dav pro-
gram, and from the poor participation by students that will
be shown in the phenomenal (and very expensive) Chan-
cellor’s Inauguration. Perhaps the new imported student
body will appreciate such efforts on the part of the Univer-
sity, but not the present enrollment.

The problem ofthis waste of time cannot be bought off
with the outrageously luxurious lobby of the Union or all

9 its dazzlingfacilities. Someone has to work a remarkable

make psychological history.

1

Student Congress tlWoes . .- .

By Dave Bender

(Editor’s Note—This -is the second in a series
of columns by this year’s Student Congress Presi-
dent Dave Bender. His columns will concern the
problems of student government at Pitt.)

Trends in government, especially on the Ameri-
can scene, have tended to be toward centralization.
Undoubtedly, duplication, bureaucracy and ineffi-
ciency are the chief evils of decentralized system.
It is not surprising then, that student governments
have been particularly interested in this. attitude.
Student Congress, itself, has been studying the
problems of decentralization at
Pitt through a special commit-
tee on evalution of the total
structure of student government.
Their ﬁndings will soon be com-
pleted and presented to the new
Student Congress.

There are, however, some evi-
dent difﬁculties resulting from
the three headed system that
now prevails on «this Campus.
Men’s Council, concerned with men’s activities, and
WSGA, involved‘ with women’s affairs, are on an
equal footing-—as far as jurisdictional rights are
concerned-—with Student Congress.

On the surface the system looks workable. At
a closer glance it is less congruent. Unfortunately,
the jurisdiction of. the three organizations has never
been clearly deﬁned.-\ The placement of ‘new proj-
ects is constantly a problem for the three groups.
Does any project concern only men or only women,
or dd‘ they really concern to a large extent the total
student body?

Separate Government

A system involving only separate men’s and
women’s government has been proposed by some.
Committees of the two organizations would be joined
when discussing issues that involved both groups.
There is no reason to suspect that this arrangement

’ could work. Experience has shown us that it can re-

sult in only total incoherency.This“ year, a joint com-
mittee of Men’s Council and WSGA did little to
effectia uniform blazer, although the need for uni-
formity has been seen for some time. Dissatisfac-
tion arose from their joint publication of the
Polaris. Also, the community does not see the re-

sults produced by either government as a sepa-
rate men’s or women’s project. The publicity on
the senior women deserting Coronation in the

_Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reveals this; from the ar-

ticle it apears to have been a total student body
concern. '

It is becoming more and more apparent that
sex is no longer a valid device for classiﬁcation.
The areas of joint interest are too large for women
to segregate themselves on the twelfth ﬂoor with
separate activities. Neither is it a realistic,prepa-
ration for life. Such self-conscious, self—indulgent
concern is a narrowing experience. It is even an
embarrassing one for many of the Women.

Community Living .
Preparation for community living, marriage, an
a fulﬁlling life for women or men cannot be at-
tained without the necessary element of the op-
posite sex. Contrary toprevalent belief, the indul-
gence of intellectual participation by women with
men does not reduce the femininity of women.
Their claim, is enhanced as they learn to not only
be individuals but partners. ‘ V M
The most tragic ﬂaw of our government struc-

, ture is the inability of the three governments to

speak‘ effectively for the total student body. It is
all too easy for the administration to‘ disregard the
opinion of one group in favor‘ of a conflicting
opinion of another. Thus, the most important in-
strument for expression by the student body has
been stifled. The desires of the students have been
evaded, passed back and forth, and ﬁnally lost in
committees. The lack of conﬁdence that their de-
cisions will be heard and accepted as the oﬁ‘icial
mouthpiece adds to the ineffectiveness.

If blame is to be placed on anyone—and this 4

seems to be a major tradition——it can only be
placed on the complacency of former students. It
is inconceivable that intelligent individuals could
be so long hood—winked into accepting an archaic
and unworkable system with little or no effort to“
effect change. H

With 1» the year-long study that has gone on in ‘

Student Congress it appears that a constructive
change .will soon be made. The ﬁnal approval,

however, must be made by the student body. That '

job may be small but it is ‘all-important, that of
casting the ballots.

In 1941 these men broke the
Hollywood barrier with their
ﬁrst original screen story, “My

Panama were considerably suc-

were responsible for a number

goer in the country mood.
Singer Discovered

It is interesting to know how
Peter Palmer was chosen for the
part of Li’l Abner. He was dis-
covered by the producers sing-
ing on the Ed Sullivan TV Var-
iety. Show as the winner of the
All-Army singing championship
early in 1956. As soon as he was
discharged from Fort Sam Hous-
ton, where‘ he spent two years
as an entertainment specialist at
Brooke Army Hospital, he was
summoned to New York for the
ﬁnal nod of approval for the
coveted title role. Palmer, born

in Milwaukee, is_six feet, four

tend to make the audience at-
tentive throughout the entire
performance.

Absent from the New -York
Stage for the past three years is,
Edith Adams who vividly por-
trays the character of Daisy Mae.
The producers have selected a
ﬁne choice in giving her the
part. She is a delightful actress

' to watch.

Her sparkling eyes, attractive
ﬁgure and beautiful face aids in
making the show the hit that it
is. Miss Adams is a veteran of
Broadway, having played in
“The Wonderful Town”
years ago. Recently, she had set
a precedent by winning her sec-
ond consecutive D o n a l d s 0 11
Award; one for the Best Debut
Performance and the other for
the Best Supporting Actress.

Her schooling includes gradu-
ation from the J ulliard Sch.eo‘l of
Music and the Columbia Drama
School. She plays the part of a
typically naive gal who sets out
to get her fellow which she does.
In short shorts and low—cut
blouse she woos all male on-
lookers in her quest for Li’l Ab-
ner.

Musically this show sparkles
with such numbers as, “If I Had
My Druthers,” ,“Namely You,”
“The Country’s,in the Very Best
of Hands,” and “Oh Happy Day.”

VIDEOT’S DELIGHT

The academic world has made its ﬁrst tentative steps

" into television. A few lectures, a few seminars, but may

I respectfully suggest that the academic World has not
yet learned the full potential of television?

Why don’t the colleges use television’s yast capacity
to dramatize, to amuse, to unshackle the imagination?
Like, for example, this:

ANNOUNCER: Howdy, folks. Well, it’S time again for
that lovable, laughable pair, Emmett Twonkey Magruder,
Ph.D., and Felicia May Crimscott, M.A., in that rollick-
ing, roistering fun show, American History 101. . . . And
here they are, the team that took the “hiss” out of
“hiStory”—Emmett Twonkey Magruder and Felicia May
Crimscottl

DR. MAGRUDER: Howdy, folks. A funny thing hap-
pened to me on the way to my doctorate. A mendicant
approached me and said, “Excuse me, sir, will you give
me 25 cents for a sandwich?” I replied, “Perhaps I will,
my good man. Let me see the sandwich.”

MISS CRIMSCOTT: Oh, how droll, Dr. Magruder! How I

piquant! How je ne sais (moi! . . . But enough of badl-
nage. Let us get on with our rollicking, roistering fun
show, American History 101.

DR. MAGRUDER: Today We will dramatize the taut and
tinglingstory of John Smith and Pocahontas. I will play
Captain Smith and Miss Crimscott will play Pocahontas.

ANNOUNCER: But ﬁrst a message from our sponsor.

treated yourself to that good natural tobacco — zestful
yet mild, hearty yet gentle, rich yet dulcet? Hmmm?
Have you? . . . If not, light a Philip Morris soon. Light

maid stands by a moonlit brook. Suddenly she hears a
footstep behind her. She turns . . .

MISS CRIMSCOTT: Oh! John Smith! You-um startle-

Third of a Series

Panther Backs To Be
Big Question Marks

“One of, the greenest spots on the team” is the way Coach John
Michelosen sizes up his backﬁeld for 1957. At three of the back-
ﬁeld positions, the two halfs and fullback, Michelosen has three

~, lettermen, but this a misleading statistic.

Last year at this time, the Panther grid mentor had four lex-
perienced halfbacks for use—Dick Bowen, Bags Bagamery, Corky

Cost; and Nick Passodelis.

He also had the four boys who make up
the top two strings for the coming campaign——Jim Theodore, Dick

Haley, Joe Scisley, and John Flara. '

Bowen is still here, but unless he is needed for halfback duty
because of injuries, he will be the starting fullback.

Both gridders who are slated for extensive workat halfs,
Theodore and Haley, have current han/dicaps and are “big question

 

marks.”

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
    
  
  
 
 
 
 
    
    

for some time.

Scisley

Scisley weighs
.180 pounds and
is an even 6
feet.

F 1 a r a, who
recently acquir-
ed the title
“Dishes,” is probably the fastest
runner on the squad. Flara, from
Midland, showed up good at spots
in Spring practice and could be a
big help in the Fall. He will also
do some of the Panthers’ punt-
ing. ’

H Cox

Other halfback hopefuls are Andy Sepsi,
George Valesky, and Jim Cox, all sophomores.
Sepsi was a fullback in high school, a left half
on last year’s freshman team, and will now run
from right half. Michelosen says that Sepsi
displayed good potential in the Spring. Vales-

Theodore has a charley horse, and the
“Comet? has a bad back which has bothered him

Theodore is a senior from Wilmerding, and
weighs 180 pounds and stands 5 feet, 10 inches.
He is described as a strong runner who could

have his biggest year in 1957. Haley is slightly

bigger than his running mate,
going at 190 pounds. One of
the fastest men on the team,
Haley -comes from Midway,
Pa.

Backing up this pair are
Scisley and Flara. Scisley is strong
band a good
b l o c k e r , but
doesn’t h a v e
the break-away
speed that some
of the o t h e r
halfbacks have.

Sepsi

Theodore

ky, at —6 feet, 1 inch, is taller than most of
the backs, but will-need experience. i V
Cox, who comes from Collingdale, played a lot of ball on the
frosh team, but was out“ this Spring with knee trouble.

If Bowen is needed at one of the halfs, Michelosen will have

depth at fullback to replace him but not experience.

Bob Stark is

a hard blocker, but doesn’t have enough speed. However, he is strong
and could ,“get a few more yards” on plays.

Court Plowman is up from the Panther yearlings and has showed
sparks of good ability. Fred Riddle is another’ possibility,‘but he

Jim Dunlap then blasted out his

the lone tally of the game.

The Bisons managed to col-
lect just four hits off Panther
captain Moog, who now has won
four straight tussles without a

the losers had two men on the

at Mellon Field. The game,

starting at 3 p.m., is the second between the two teams this
season. The Panthers, who now have a 7-6 record, defeated
the Bearcats, 12-5, back on April 27.

The local nine is currently working with a two—game
win streak and can equal theirO~

with a grand slam blow in the
fourth frame, and Schoeppener
chipped in with a circuit drive
with one man aboard in the fol-
lowing inning.

The local scored in ﬁve dif-
ferent innings, and in four of
those winning pitcher Bill Ham-
ilton was the first man to get
on base. In the fourth, ﬁfth,
and sixth Hamilton, only a
sophomore, received free passes
and then in the eighth he sin-
glad. And every time he was
knocked across with runs.

Four of «the local nine had two

 hits each out of the total of 13.

Jaxel had a single and a double,
Schoeppener swatted a double be-

vi sides his four-bagger, and Dunlap

and cost had a pair of singles.

Hamilton gave up a run in the
ﬁrst, one in the seventh, and then
got into trouble in the ninth when
Clarion rallied for four runs. John
Mirabelli replaced ‘Hamilton and

retired the Teachers.

Geneva showed the Panthers
a bit of their own power last
Thursday as they clobbered
them, 19-8. In this one Mirabelli,
was tagged with the loss, his
second of the season. He has
yet. to win. He did, however,
show some offensive power with
a couple of BRI’s. P

This current slugging splurge
has enabled the Panther hitters to
boost their averages to a rather‘\
high point. Corky Cost, who this
year made the change from the
outfield to secondgbase, is out in
front of the Panthers with a.405
average.

Dunlap is right behind the foot-
baller at an even .400. Other cats
over .300 are Jaxel, .333; Joe Wal-
ton, .318; and Hoover, .300. The
remaining three starters are hit-
ting as follows: Herman J oy—.250,
DeLost——-.250, and Schoeppener—-
.212.

For Third Win, 68-62

Coach Carl Olson’s tracksters ran true to form on Satur-
day—-winning the dash events and losing the ﬁeld events-—
as they notched their third straight dual meet win of the
season, 68-62, over Army’s Cadets at West Point, N. Y.

 Jim Donahue paced the Panthers to the win by scoring
a double in the 100- and 220-yard dashes for the third con-

secutive time this year. Donahue,0~

a slender speedster from Central
Catholic, raced the century in
:()9:9 and the 220—yard dash in
:21.1.

The Panthers’ highly—touted
sophomore distance runner from
Erie Cathedral, Vince Timon, fell
short again in his bidvto capture

the 'two—mile run when the Cad-

et’s Jerry Lewis raced to a com-
paratively easy triumph.

Paul Thrash and Bob Russell
dominated the hurdles by taking

. four of the top six places in the

two hurdles events. Thrash, who

. won the 400-meter hurdles at

the Penn Relays last wek, glided
over the 220-yard ‘hurdles in
:24.8 with Russell a close second.
' Th e 120-yard high hurdles
found Russell winning in :15.0
with Thrash only a short distance

: behind.

The Blue and Gold continued
their superiority in the half-mile
and quart_er-mile-by notching a

_ﬁrst and third place in each. '

Charley Heflin, ex-Westing-

house product, copped the quar-

ter-mile dash in 148.7, a very fast
time, while Dick Doyle, former
Erie Strong star, was edged out of
second place by Pete Byrne. '

Jimmy Moore covered the half-

‘mile in 155.4 with the Jungle

Cats’ Sam Grisciotti
Ill., ﬁnishing third.
The Panthers received a wel-
come" break in the sprint events
when Army’s Bob Kyasky was
