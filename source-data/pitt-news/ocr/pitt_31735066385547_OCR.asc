By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer -

Pitt will not be roéked by the
wake of the Supreme Court
decision of Jan. 9 which will
force colleges and universities to
turn tenure— review materials over
to government agencies for
investigation of illegal promotion
practices, said Professor Phillip
Wion, president of United Faculty.

This landmark case arose when
Rosalie T ung, a former associate
management professor at the
University of Pennsylvania, said
that the university denied her
tenure because of her race and
sex. As a result of the Court’s
decision, the university must turn
over peer reviews of Tung to the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission so the allegation can
be investigated.

This decision will not affect
Pitt, because by the Fall of 1988
the University’s administration
had already put such a policy
into effect, according to a UF
report. That

investigation if he chooses, Wion
said.

No matter where the decision
comes from, many university
officials feel that the new policy

Group offers support

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

One can literally hear a pin
drop in the small room of the
William Pitt Union as the eight
women attending the weekly
meeting of Pitt's eating-concerns
group sit in silence.

“Things haven’t been too bad

i " lately, I guess,” said one of the
women; “Sometimes it gets really _

hard.-, Taking that first step is
important, but things do
eventually fall in place.”

As Rhonda Torninello listens to
the women talk, a look of definite
concern is visible on her face.
She is here tonight to offer her
help and support to them, but
more importantly, the eight young
women are at the meeting to help
themselves.

Although each one is dealing
with her own problem, they all
have one common reason for
attending the meeting. The eight
women have eating disorders.

The most common. disorders
include bulimia, which is a

whereby faculty members are
evaluated by their own peers for
the promotion.

"Faculty members will be more
reluctant to be candid in their

to students

constant craving for food, and
anorexia, which is an almost total
loss of appetite. All who attend
realize they have a problem and
are seeking help.

“An [eating disorder] does not
have to be severe for someone to
want to change it,” said T ominello,
facilitator of Pitt’s eating—concerns
group. _

The purpose of the group is
not therapy, but rather a source
of support. for those who ‘find
themselves unable to control their
eating habits. T orninello and guest

p e o p 1 e
responsible for
their recommendations is a good
thing. "Racial and sexual prejudice
should not be a factor in decisions,
and this helps ensure that it
won’t.”

Some academicians, such as

 

selection

Ernst Benjamin, general secretary
of the American Association of
University Professors, an
organization with which UF is
affiliated, feel that such a policy
will force the tenure system
underground, according to a
report in USA Today.

“There will be less in the files 
more phone calls, more use of
the grapevine; really illicit means”
will be used by faculty members
to make recommendations so that
they will not have to fall under
scrutiny, he said.

Wion does not feel this will
happen at Pitt: “I think most
faculty here have behaved

, responsibly in the past and are

not worried.

“If people have doubts about
whether to say something or not,
they probably have doubts as to
the propriety of their judgement.”

with eating disorders

speakers such as nurses refer the
group members to professional
help.

During the meetings,
participants discuss their fears,
anxieties, and other problems
related to their ﬂawed eating
habits.

According to Tominello, each
person has a different “breaking”
point. When people realize that
they have no control over what
they are taking in andletting out-
of their bodies, they usually look
for help. if ’ ’

“After enough friends, mates
and family members confront
them, it starts to sink in," said
Tominello. It is then that a person
says, “Maybe I do have a
problem.”

All attending agreed that there
were issues behind their eating
disorders, often involving more
than just wanting to lose weight,
They are dealing with a long
string of built-up emotions that

' theyhave lost control of.

Life of Oscar Wilde
dramatized in play

Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

The stage is set, the music starts, and the famous playwright and
poet, Oscar Wilde stands before us. ‘

“As I speak, my life can be brought back to you, if you want it
to. Simple expression is the reality of things,” said Kerry Ashton
as he portrayed Wilde in his one—man play.

The play, “The Wilde Spirit,” was directed and written, both
music and lyrics, by Ashton, who first performed the show in

Hollywood in 1977.

“The Wilde Spirit,” which comes from Living Literature in New
York, was sponsored last night by the Pitt Program Council.
Martha Moranz of the PPC coordinated the performance.

“It was attractive to many groups of people. I tried to focus on
the theater and English departments where I thought there would

be interest,” said Moranz.

Ashton sees playing the part of the fellow playwright as
inspiring. “When I first went to Hollywood and started my career,
I knew I could write, or well, I thoughtl could. In college I learned
a little bit about Oscar Wilde. He had a hard life, but he was a

brilliant writer,” said.

After some research he decided Wilde’s life would make a
good play, and also decided to make it a one—man performance.
In the play, Ashton becomes Wilde, telling his life story and
giving his thoughts to the audience. He scans the crowd and
announces, “The public always takes things too seriously. That is

the original sin of the public.”

of being afraid to tell others close
to them about their problem for
fear of hurting those they cared
about. There seemed to be a fear
of placing the blame on someone
other than themselves.

“When one cannot successfully
get around the underlying aspects
of their problem, he or she must ’
be treated,” said Tominello.

“IThose with problems] need

ongoing support and treatment
all the way through recovery,”
she added.

Many issues involved in eating
disorders include such things as
body image, self-esteem and
disfunctioning family lives.

“There are certain stresses that
are speciﬁc to school,” said
T ominello.

All those attending the meeting
were dealing with personal as

well as social pressure, using
either binging or purging of food
as a way out.

“What can you do after putting
down a whole pizza, a box of
Oreos, and a ha1f—ga11on of ice
cream in one sitting?” asked one
woman at the meeting.

In response to a question like
the former, T ominello may

She, along with the rest in
attendance will attempt to help
the individual come in touch
were her emotions.

A recovering bulinuc herself,
Tominello was first referred to
Pitt’s concern group in
December of 1986, during her
senior year at Pitt.

“Since it had personal
meaning, I decided [Pitt’s] group

would be very good for me,”e
" said T ominello. “I hope to train

people in how to start [eating
disorder groupsl,” she added.
Suggesting work with a
dietician, Tominello is still
receiving support after three
years of successful recovery.
Although all in attendance at
Pitt’s meeting were female,
Tominello stresses that eating
disorders are not only found in
women. (The ratio of women to
men with problems is 9:1.)
Those with eating disorders
are regarded as secretive and
compulsive people, often
striving to be perfectionists.
“Body image is a big factor,”

 

said T ominello. Many times, those
involved in any type of sport with
a weight—class requirement are
targets for eating disorders.

“We may be talking about
gymnasts, runners, swimmers and
even cheerleaders,” Tominello
added.

Frequently in males an eating

-disorder can occur as a result of

such things as the prolongeduse
of steroids.

She stresses that the key to
beating the disorders are coping

‘mechanisms. “We try to offer

healthier coping mechanisms. No
one should be ashamed of having
an eating disorder,” said T ominello.

“It is a very secretive, and guilt
producing thing,” she added. “A
bunch of emotions build up that
one can not deal with. Then they
get the feeling that they are too
fat.”

Tominello has looked back to
when she was 15 pounds lighter
then she is today, and found that
she was unhappy. She is happy
today, though. “Being very thin
did not help at all,” she said.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Panthers demolish hapless Boston Co

By Jim Tezak
Contributing Editor

Pitt basketball coach Paul Evans

7 celebrated his forty-ﬁfth birthday

at Fitzgerald Field House last
night, and the Panther players
couldn’t wait to get in line to give
him their gifts.

-Darren Morningstar got his
first jam as a Panther and ﬁnished
with eight points, more than
double his season average.

-Travis Ziegler and Derrick
Layton scored their first points of
the season.

oRod Brookin collected ﬁve
assists.

-Darelle Porter had 12 assists
to push himself past Sean Miller
and into third place on the all-
time Pitt assist chart. More
importantly, he committed just
one turnover the entire game.

-Bobby Martin converted ﬁve
three—point plays, something
former Panther Charles Smith was
often criticized for not being able
to do.

-Jason Matthews shot ﬁve for

' eight from three-point range,

including hitting three treys in
the first five minutes.

-Brian Shorter dominated
inside, scoring 28 points and
grabbing 11 rebounds.

-Every player on the Panther
roster scored, except Porter and

V Brian Brush, as Pitt demolished

the Boston College Eagles 110-80
in front of a national television

audience courtesy of ESPN and a.

capacity crowd of 6,798 in the
Field House.

“I didn’t even know it
was,[Evans’l birthday until they
said it on the speaker,” said
Shorter. .

“Was it his birthday today?”
asked Martin, looking over at
Shonen

Regardless of whether the
Panthers had Evans’ birthday on

their minds or not, they put on a
show last night against the hapless
Eagles, and they enjoyed it.

Matthews and Martin, who
combined for 49 points, scored
Pitt’s first 15 points as the Panthers
roared out to a 15-4 lead barely
six minutes into the game. B.C.
closed to within three, 18-15, but
an eight point run brought the
Pitt lead back to 11. The Eagles
never made a serious run after
that.

It was Boston College’s ninth
straight loss after a 6-4 start. They
are 0-9 in the Big East. Pitt jumped
to 8-10, 2-5 in the league, with its
second consecutive victory and
third in the past four games.

Despite the lopsided score, B.C.

coachjim O’Brien still thinks that

the Eagles have the potential to
be a good team if he can keep his
young players from becoming
discouraged. At one point during
the Pitt game, he said that
freshman center David Hinton
returned to the bench crying.

“We’ve got to keep it from
getting to the young kids. [The
month of January] hasn’t been
very easy for anybody,” O’Brien
said.

The frustration the Eagles have
felt so far this season was evident
early when freshman Lior Arditti
was called for the first of four
B.C. technical fouls. ‘

Shorter said, “They were kind
of frustrated. Mainly their players
were getting mad and trying to
get us mad."

The Panthers completely
dominated Boston College in
every phase of the game, but
Evans still saw room for
improvement.

“I wasn’t pleased with our
offense the first 14 or 15 minutes.
Most of our points were on
inbounds plays. Actually when
Pat [Cavanaughl came in the last

four min.utes, he controlled the
tempo and got the ball inside to
Brian [Shorterl,” Evans said.

S O’Brien said that the way Pitt

played last night, their starting
five,pl;us Brookin coming off the
bench, is as good as any in the
Big East.

“I think the way they played

tonight is the way people have

Porter tot/ees third on Pitt assist list

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

When the Pitt basketball game
ended, the Panthers had scored
110 points, knocked down 38 of
50 free throws, and their starting
point guard contributed to none
of the physical scoring.

It sounds as if Darelle Porter
had done little to aid the Panthers’
victory.

Wrong.

What Porter quietly did last
night was assist on twelve Pitt
baskets and slide past Sean Miller
and Peter Strickland into third
place on the all-time Panther assist
list with 367.

With a little over nine minutes
left in the game, Porter drove to
the hoop and lost the ball off his
knee. After diving to retrieve the
ball, he blindly flipped the it over
his head to teammate Jason
Matthews in the corner from

where Matthews promptly
deposited it for three points.

“We are starting to push the
ball again on the fast break and
it's making a big difference in our
point total the past couple games, "
said Matthews.

“We have to keep running our
fast break to win."

That is exactly what Porter did
last night, push the ball, almost
too much according to coach
Paul Evans. “I wasn’t pleased
with our offense in the first half.
We weren’t getting the ball inside.
We were rushing things,” Evans
said.

The strange thing about that
statistic is that Porter has only
played point guard for the
Panthers this season. With the
injury to Miller, the Panthers have

‘ looked to Porter to step into a

role he had never played before
on this level of competition.
In his first two years at Pitt,

Porter has been Mr. Versitility.
At 6-foot-4-inches, Porter had
played small forward and
contributed tremendously late his
freshman year by starting the last
eight games at shooting guard.
With the little time he has spent
at his new position, Porter could
eventually be able to move all the
way to the top of Pitt’s assist list.

He is averaging 8.0 assists per
game. At that pace, Porter would
have 224 this season, which
would be a Pitt all—time record
and 444 for his career. The players
in front of Porter are Dwayne
Wallace (1978-82) with 436 and
Curtis Aiken (1983-87) with 378.

“Darelle can do whatever
Darelle wants to do,” said center
Bobby Martin who enjoyed some
of Porter’s passes by scoring 25
points. “Darelle is from Pittsburgh
(Perry High School) and he has a
lot to prove to his hometown."

Penguins aren't all that bad  bu defense stinks

I've been reading a lot about
how the Penguins’ defense stinks
lately. How their goals-against-
average is rapidly approaching
the national debt. And how they
had better start keeping the puck
out of their net or else the city of
Pittsburgh will be looking at a
Patrick Division cellar dweller in
no time.

This is Certainly true and has
been quite clearly demonstrated
within the past few games. The
Pens have lost 9-3 to the Islanders,
experienced a 7-2 thrashing in
Buffalo and suffered their most
recent 6-3 loss to the worst team

in the division, the Flyers.

The Penguins redefine the word
“inconsistent.” But as soon as
people realize that the Pens may
not, and I stress the words may
not, be a Stanley Cup—caliber team,
then they will realize that the
Pens are going to play well in all
areas of their game occasionally.
But most of the time, an aspect of
their game is going to stink.

On that note, let’s move on to
what the Penguins are doing right
lately and use the Flyers game
(since it was televised) to illustrate.

The offense has played
extremely well as of late. Notice
I didn’t say they were scoring
well. But several individuals are

playing a key role in setting up
scoring chances with aggressive
skating and crisp passes.

Aside from Lemieux, whose
effort and play are not subject to
criticism, Tony Tanti has been
playing like a possessed man.
T anti brings to the Pens a player
whom they have needed for a
long time and certainly could
have used in last year's playoffs.
T anti’s ability to drive to the goal
and stay in the crease without
getting knocked off his skates
adds a new dimension to the
Pens’ attack.

Tanti crosses the opponent’s
blue line with a vengeance and

maintains his intensity until he
gets off a shot or stakes his claim
to the ice in the crease.

Tanti’s style of going to the net
is much akin to Philly’s

outstanding Tim Kerr. And Kerr
was a major factor in the Flyers’

playoff victory over the Pens last
season.

Paul Coffey is also on a tear,
especially on the power play. It
seems that if the Penguins are
successful offensively on certain

, nights, Coffey is the man who

provides the offensive spark and
veteran leadership that pump up
the entire team and keep the
momentum in Pittsburgh’s favor.

Against the Flyers, Coffey toyed
with the puck in setting up his
passes and shots at a mind-

boggling pace. He moved the
biscuit around so fast that the
KBL cameramen sometimes lost
the focus of the action.

An added plus to his game is
the way he can bring the puck
back out to the slot after a rebound
and proceed to turn and fire it
right back to the net. He fired
plenty of times against Flyers’
goaltender Ken Wregget, but
Wregget was a brick wall all night
long.

Mark Recchi has been serving
the role of “Scrapper” lately.
Recchi has 35 points (16 goals, 19
assists) in 45 games and boasts an
impressive + 12 plus/minus rating.

It is important to note that the
Pens have outshot their opponents
in the past three games, further
supporting the fact that the Pens
are certainly creating the
opportunities.

Wregget had an outstanding
game on Tuesday night. The
Penguins threw everything and
the kitchen sink at him, but
Wregget closed the door on most
of the 38 shots he faced.

The previous game in Buffalo,
Darren Puppa had a banner outin.,

Against the Islanders, well,
forget it. That was just plain
embarrassing. -

Anyway, the Pens have been
creating the opportunities, an area
of their game they have been
having trouble with in the past. At
least that aspect is on the upswing.

For now.

worldly, mature and cynical, with
a diligent skill for changing the

have convinced Andrey that
neither government will ever

sides are determined to hang on
to their ability to annihilate the

is summarized in the quote, “Our

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, February 1, 1990

 

 

By Richard Turgeon
Staff Writer

The atmosphere in the cold
social room of the Stephen Foster
Memorial Theatre was one of

‘félanticipation and excitement

yesterday at 11:30 a.m. Without
announcement, a man in a black
leather jacket, blue jeans and
sneakers quietly appeared with
Stephen Coleman, the director of
Pitt's theatre M.F.A. program, and
got himself some coffee before
his introduction.

Compared to the person one

‘may remember from AudreyRose,
Magic, The Bounty and The

ElepbantMan, Anthony Hopkins
seemed shorter, minimalistic,
tangible. For a veteran
Shakespearean actor whose ﬁlm
credits also include the soon-to-
be-released Silence of the Lambs,
directed by Jonathan Demme
(Stop Making Sense, Married to

"' -tbe Mob), and a remake of

Hitchcock's TbeDesperateHours,
with Mickey Rourke, Mr. Hopkins
seemed the perfect complement
to his usually intense theater and
film performances.

Underneath his responses
throughout the hour—and-a-half
question-and-answer session lay
a consistent, genuine modesty
and candid honesty. Soft-spoken
and unassuming, he illustrated
each answer with interest and
careful elaboration while neatly,
nervously rearranging his coffee
paraphernalia.

Mr. Hopkins is in town directing
the one~man play Dylan Thomas.-
Retum journey, which is being

‘performed by Welsh actor Bob

Kingdom. The show will make a
one-time-only appearance Feb.
16 at the Stephen Foster Memorial
Theatre at 8 p.m., and Hopkins
will be present to introduce the
play.

He is also currently shooting
Jonathan Demme’s psychological

thriller Silence of tbe Lambs here
in Pittsburgh, which co«starsjodie
Foster and Scott Glenn. Mr.
Hopkins plays a murdering
“advanced paranoid
schizophrenic” named Hannibal
Lecter, a character whom he
described as “a lot of fun" to play.

The topics of conversation
ranged from his Welsh accent to
the film directors he most (and
least) enjoys working with. He
calls Demme “the best director
I’ve ever worked with,” while
calling David Lynch (TbeElepbant
Man, Blue Velvet) “rather odd”
and “non—specific.”

While Mr. Hopkins didn’t enjoy
his experience with Lynch
because of his free-ﬂoating
directing style, he stresses his
personal preference for a director
“who knows what he wants.
When as director says, ‘This is
going to be a voyage of discovery,’
I pack my bags and go. I like
definition, and I don't like lack of
definition.”

Mr. Hopkins possesses, alluded
to and seemed to admire the
focus and purpose of an actor
playing a part, a I focus ‘that
included “discipline” in his or her
working habits and establishing
a set of prioritiesfor one’s life. He
logically sees himself as part of
the machine that consists of the
people he works with on the set
of a play or movie.

This “discipline” includes
“treating others with respect,”
“being friendly and talking to
people” and the idea of “simply
functioning” in your job with
commitment and consistency,
regardless of position or high
stature. If it is implied that Mr.
Hopkins has established these
philosophies with experience, it
is also obvious from listening to

him that they are practiced and

trusted.

Once again Athens, Ga.,
synonymous with the new music
scene, has squeezed out yet
another ground-breaking band:
the B—S2’s.

Although the B—52’s have not
released an album in the last
three years, their long—awaited
album, Cosmic Thing, is out with
a big bang. The album contains
ten cuts of pure fun and laughter
which the group is famous for,
along with a few underlying
messages.

With this new album, the band
wanted to affirm their Southern
roots as well as emphasize their
tight inner relationship.

“We’re a group first and
foremost,” asserts vocalist Fred
Schneider, “and on this album
we wanted to emphasize that.
We got away from some of the
more technological aspects of
music in favor of the basics, a feel
closer to what we sound like in
performance.” 0

UENDERHW

By Dmitri Ragano
Asst. Showcase Editor

Good, bad and ugly —
nobody makes noise like
Public Enemy. Finally, rap’s
greatest act brings the noise to
Pittsburgh by playing at the
Syria Mosque tonight.

For two years, Public Enemy
has produced a whirlwind of
protest and controversy, not
to mention some of the best
pop music of the past decade.
Their 1988 landmark album, It
Takes a Nation of Millions to
Hold Us Bacle, redefined the
sound and content of rap,
forcing folks to recognize a
no—respect genre.

Leader Chuck D.’s preached
black power, slamming racism
and South Africa, “ﬁghting the
power” and summoning King
and Malcolm X from the
schoolbooks into the streets.
Not since the heyday of the
Clash has a pop group made
political consciousness so hip.

While singing, “Don’t
Believe the Hype,” Public
Enemy never stopped feeding

 

the media’s multi-headed hype
monster. This summer, the strategy
blew up in their faces. Professor
Griff, the band’s “Minister of
Information” and disciple of Black
Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan, gave
an interview in which he claimed
Jews were responsible for “the
majority of wickedness that goes on
across the globe.” Griff was fired,
then later restored to the group,
while Chuck D. defended his band
against charges of anti—Semitism.

Public Enemy’s new single
“Welcome to the Terrordome” has
done nothing to calm the storms.
Their first song since last summer's
“Fight the Power,” “Terrordome” is
dense with grooves and imagery;
it's a great single.

But it also has some reckless,
potentially offensive remarks.
“Crucifixion ain't no ﬁction/ So-called
chosen frozen/ Apologies made to
whoever p1eases/ Still they got me
like Jesus,” says Chuck D., in a clear
allusion to Jews and the Griff
incident. And the anti-Semitic
accusations started all over again.

Granted, none of this is clearly
bigoted the way Guns N’ Roses’

Enemy

Continued from page 6
“One in a Million" is. And before
accusing anyone of racism, we
should remember that the pop
music industry has always been a
racist one. (Elvis and the Stones
became rich and famous because
they were white boys singing
black music.)

Still, the Griff and “Terrordome”
controversies are important. If
Public Enemy echoes Jesse
Jackson's emotionally charged
black nationalism, they've echoed
his shameful “Hymietown”
remark as well. Many people —
black and white — think black
anti-Sernitism is despicable. Some
think it understandable
(economic subjugation, Israel’s
pact with South Africa, etc  ).
Everyone sees the bitter division
it has caused on the Left.

Controversy aside, Public
Enemy sounds damn good.
Chuck D. and sidekick Flavor
Flav’s verbal antics are

unmatched. The music fuses hard
funk, space—age sonics and
Coltranish cacophony, replacing
rap’s old dead—end minimalism.
And unlike studio—dependent
rappers like De La Soul, Public
Enemy has a reputation as a
good live act. Opening acts
include Queen Latifha.

While 30 percent of Public
Enemy’s album sales are white, it
will be interesting to see how
integrated tonight’s crowd is.
Unfunky white boy that I am, I
can't help but wonder if the
violence of past Pittsburgh rap
concerts will repeat itself. This is
a sad, inevitable reminder of the
tension surrounding Public
Enemy, rap and race in this
country.

With tonight’s show and their
eagerly awaited Fear of a Black
Planet, Public Enemy continues
to_ prove one thing: the noise
may not get clearer, but it won’t
go away.

B—52s

Continued from page 5

gig at 21 Valentine’s Day party in
a Southern college town. Because
of their enthusiastic style and
highly visual stage movements,
the band quickly became the
favorite of Manhattan's new—wave
music scene.

From there they released an
independent single, “Rock
Lobster” backed with “52 Girls”
in the summer of 1978, and
signed on a major label.

In the next seven years, the B-
52’s put out several adventurous
and eccentric albums including
B-52’s, W/ildPlanet, 7bePartyMix
Album, Mesapotamia and
Whammy. These albums and their
free—wheeling style made them
“one of the ‘80’s most innovative

and inﬂuential groups.”

Bouncing Oﬂilbe Satellites was
the last album to include founding
member Ricky Wilson, who died
just prior to the LP’s 1986 release
date.

“After Ricky [died] we just
weren't sure it would ever be the
same,” conﬁdes his sister Cindy.
“But what we realized in the end
was that we were there for each
other. That we were our own
source of strength. After that our
decision was easy.” ,

With this strength in hand and
a new album under their belt, the
B—52’s have kicked off a summer

tour with their next stop here at '

the Syria Mosque with Love
Tractor on Feb. 2 at 7:50.
“Playing live is what it's all
about for us,” says Cindy. “We're
at our best when there’s people
out there reacting to our music.”
