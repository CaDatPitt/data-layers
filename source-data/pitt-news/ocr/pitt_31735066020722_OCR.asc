The Governmental Relations
Committee of the Student Govern-
ment Board met yesterday to discuss
the ongoing controversy over Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh investments in
South Africa. The Student Govern-

ment first called -for Pitt to divest-

itself of these properties and urged
support of all bills to that effect on
Oct. l2. ' ’
SGB plans to issue a position
paper on the South African issue,
and will work with state legislators
when the new legislative session be-
gins in Jan. 1985, in an attempt to
change univesity policy. To that end,
the SGB has enlisted the services of
Pitt’s Harrisburg lobbyist Dennis
McMannus. » ~ -

Comrnittee member Chuck Pas-

may affect other areas of Pitt ﬁnan-
ces, specifically _tuition.

sity budget for the next fiscal year.‘

their state aid frozen, should be\
taken at the start of the new legisla-
tive session. Legislative and univer-
sity policies may clash though,
resulting in decreased state “funding

' and increased tuition for Pitt stu-

dents, according to Pascal.

SGB plans to invite the Rev. Sulli-
van to Pitt sometime'in January to
participate in a debate or open
forum. Sullivan, a Philadelphia
minister and member of the board of

General Motors, developed six non- .

bindingdirectives known as the Sui-
livan Principles. The principles are-
intended to promote desegregation
and equal treatment in U.S.-owned
workplaces based in South Africa.
. Committee chairman member
Avery Abrams said, “lt’s important
for the board to understand what the
Sullivan Principles mean.”
Committee chairman John Leo-
pold said the event would “keep the
students aware of what is going on”
regarding South Africa. ‘
The board will also work with Pitt
social work professor Jim Cun-
ningham to organize its effort. “This
is precedent setting,” Abrams said.
“We formally appointed a second
.advisor. Under our bylaws, we are
allowed to do so, and this will
strengthen the committee,” he
added. . '

yesterday, the board was scheduled
to air their views at the Feb. 13, 1985
board of trustees meeting. Pascal
indicated that the board may present
other South African policy experts
at the meeting. \

In the samesession, the Govern- ~

mental Relations Committee
expressed concern over the attempt
to restructure the Graduate School

of Public and International Affairs.

GSPIA Chairman Leopold said, “A
lot of undergraduates at Pitt were
interested in going to GSPIA.
Furthermore, state legislators are
not at all pleased with the cutting of
that graduate program.” Leopold
added that the board will attempt to
identify the members of the GSPIA
student government and work with
them.

Both coaches watched a rare dis-

Child sexual abuse “out of closet” saysPitt prof  

 JoeI~Bloom
The Pitt. News

The sexual abuse of children is by
no means a new problem in society,
but, as Dr. Anthony Mannarino,
assistant professor of psychiatry and
psychology at Pitt, says, “We, as a
society, are being made more aware
by the media. Until a few years ago,
nobody talked about it, but recent
programs such asthe 60 Minutes
episode are making people more
aware." '

Mannarino’s comments came as
part of the latest in Western Psychi-
atric lnstitute’s “Insights” lecture
series, “Child Sexual Abuse: A
Guide To Parents.” His co-lecturer
was Dr. Judith Cohen, also a profes-
sor at Pitt.

Mannarino commented on why
there is increased awareness. “I don't
know if there is an increase in inci-
dence," he said. “But my guess is an
increase in reporting of incidence.
People, with the media bringing the

eaching constitutional issues topic

The judge has to decide whether
or not this young man should be
kept alive. The only means he has
with which to do this are the state-
ments of the United States
Constitution.

This illustration is one example of
how the Constitution affects our
lives. The Pennsylvania Humanities
Council presented a seminar on
teaching the Constitution yesterday
at noon in David Lawrence Audito-
rium. The Humanities Council and
the co-sponsoring‘~Pennsylvania
Department of Education have pre-
sented their workshop on teaching
the Constitution to over 100 distin-
guished educators.

Dr. Irwin Schulman, dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, began
the seminar by saying, “I first heard
of the U.S. Constitution when I was

subject out of the closet, aren’t as
afraid as they. were of getting
involved in an investigation. A sur-
vey was taken recently of college-age
people. Between 15 and 20 percent
of the females questioned admitted
to having been abused, while 10 per-
cent of the males admitted it.”

“Why is the problem now more
obvious?" one audience member
asked Dr. Cohen. “The women’s'
movement has made reporting more
acceptable. This goes for rape
reporting too," she said. “The psy-
chology of the victims is changing.
Pediatricians, teachers, and others
who come in contact with kids are
changing their attitudes. The prob-
lem is no longer being shoved under
the table." ' ,

_ Mannarino also commented that
children weren't always believed,
which he said also contributed to the
incidents not being reported.

T Mannarino addressed a number
of myths concerning sexual abuse of
children. Myth 1 —— Child abuse is
limited to incest. “Wrong,” accord-
ing to Mannarino. “Incest is but one

in elementary ‘school, and all I
remember saying was the first three
words, ‘we the people.’ Very few
individuals remember anything after
that

“The Constitution has shaped our -
' personal and political lives, but we

still don’t know what is in it. For the
Constitution to continue to survive,
we must learn what it is and apply it
in the living process,” added
Schulman.

Dr. Craig Eisendrath, executive
director of the Pennsylvania
Humanities Council, continued,
“The assumptions that students
make is that there is a single truth
and professors and teachers provide
these truths. In the case of the Con-
stitution and other historic events,
there are many interpretations that
can be made.”

‘etc., may also perpetrate,” he said.

Myth 2 — Sexual abuse is limited
to sexual intercourse. “False," Man-
narino said.
include intercourse, genital fond-
ling, which is the most common,
inappropriate hugging, and french
kissing. A child of three does have
the ability to distinguish between
appropriate and, inappropriate
affection.” ‘

Myth 3 — Violence is included.
“False. Violence is rarely involved,"
according to Mannarino. “The per-
petrator usually cares a great deal
about the victim. The child may be
coerced by bribes, etc. Or threats of
harm to others, such as the other
parent, may be used."

Dr. Cohen spoke about how sex-
ual abuse can get started. “Many of
today’s families are liberal regarding
nudity," she said. “Maybe some-_
times daddy will undress in front of
the children; the kids may see daddy
touching himself; perhaps daddy
may invite the child to touch him.”

Mannarino added that “Abuse

The council has developed a 13-
part audio-visual series entitled
“The Constitution: That Delicate
Balance.”

Taped in Philadelphia’s Congress
Hall, the series presents over 200
representatives of government, law,
Journalism, education and medicine
being questioned by moderators
_from leading law schools. The panel-
tsts are placed in agonizing situa-
tions where they are forced to think

,in moral and legal terms, such as the

the incident with the I8-year-old
who needs a blood transfusion.

According to Stewart Sucher—
man, executive producer. of the se-
ries, the demonstrations deal with
medical, moral and ethical issues as
well as rights and how they relate to

"period" of time. One instance is

How can sexual abuse be
detected? There are a number of
symptoms, according to Cohen.
“Some symptoms may be sadness,
depression, sleep disturbance, bed-
wetting, withdrawal anxiety, and
not wantingto be alone. Some oth-
ers in particularly young ,infants are
bloodstained undergarments.”

Mannarino commented that
advanced sexual habits and knowl-
edge must be taught. He contends
that a child experimenting sexually

. with a friend is quite normal, but for

a child to mimic sexual intercourse,
“that must be taught,” Mannarino
said. . - '
What can be done? “Pediatricians
should start to integrate abuse
awareness questions into their regu-
lar checkup routine,” Cohen stated.
She went on to say that kids should
.be taught that not all adults are
trustworthy. “Kids should learn to
trust their feelings,” she said. “If
your child doesn’t feel like giving

The series will be broadcast begin-
ning Nov. 20 on Tuesdays at 10 p.m.
and Saturdays at 5 p.m. Each pro-
gram presents a hypothetical case
study based on contemporary issues
that include:'

—— The conflict between freedom
of the press and national security

— Congressional limits on presi-
dential control of foreign policy

— The insanity defense and the
death penalty

— ' Individual privacy vs. state
intervention in life. and death
situations

“Through television, we can reach
audiences within the family home,”
said Sucherman, “and teach them
some meanings of the Constitution."-

Uncle Harry a kiss, accept that. The

'child’s personal space should be

respected.” .

Cohen also stressed that parents
should be receptive if the child is
telling them something bad. “Telling
the truth should be rewarded, re-
inforced," she said. K

Cohen said that children do not lie
about things such as sexual abuse.
Just as kids cannot mimic without
being shown, she says, neither can
they make up things without having
been first exposed to them. “Chil-
dren are more honest,” she said.
“They haven't yet been exposed to
social rules about what can and can-
not be discussed.”

How are the perpetrators pun-
ished? “In Allegheny County, the
perpetrators are rarely prosecuted,”
Mannarino said. “Family members
are often reluctant to press charges.
Also, the system is complicated. The
judicial system is an adversarial pro-
cess.” In fact, “Prosection of the per-
petrator may indeed be more
traumatic to the child than the

‘By Ann Cifra
The Pitt News

Pitt criminal law professor John
Burkoff said Sunday night in a dis-
cussion of government ‘sting opera-
tions that in undercover operations,
“the focal issue has tended to be on
predisposition.” Predisposition is
determined in part by who the
defendant’s acquaintances are, and
whether the defendant has commit-
ted the crime before. Burkoff
claimed the way the federal govern-
ment decides if a defendant has been
entrapped focuses too much on the
defendant’s record.

The federal government's system,
the subjective theory of entrapment,
focuses on the defendant alone and
on whether or not he had “subjective
intent” to commit the crime. There is

potential for class bias in this sys-
tem, Burkoff said, pointing out the
prestige factor in—the case of John
DeLorean, who was recently acquit-
ted of narcotics charges.

Burkoff mentioned another area
of sting operations that he is con-
cerned about. He said that searching
for criminal acts without cause
creates crime because “everyonehas
a price. If there are no checks when
you send off government officials,
there is the possibility, even the
probability, that you will create
crime."» To place checks on law
enforcement, Burkoff advocated
substantiation of the government’s
motives for a sting operation and
neutral determination of the legality
of the government's actions.

J. Allen Johnson, U.S. Attorney
for the western district of Pennsylva-
nia, did not agree with Burkoff.

Even though grand juries were
created in recent years to aid law
enforcement officials, Johnson said,
it became apparent that investiga-
tive grand juries could not be relied
upon to effectively penetrate into
what should be investigated. The
sting operations are particularly
effective in public corruption and
narcotics cases, Johnson said, where
wiretapping alone isn’t effective.
Johnson gave his definition of
entrapment as “only when criminal
conduct is the. creative intent of
government officers." Singling out
the DeLorean case, he commented,
“It was interesting to note that if it
was entrapment, the judge‘ would
have thrown the case out. Instead,

he sent it to the jury.” Johnson’

defended the use of sting operations.
“To lose the use of the undercover
technique, it will put us back a

decade and a _half in law
enforcement." . _

Pittsburgh criminal defense law-
yer Bill Manifesto did not concur
with that argument, however. “I do
not believe it is the function of law
enforcement officials to test the
virtues, to test the honesty of its citi-
zens.” What Manifesto thought was
wrong, he said, was to ensnare high
government officials by using
sophisticated schemes, ex-convicts
and considerable ﬁnancial resources
as was done in Abscam.

Abscam may have tested the

honesty of government officials by

contriving situations, but there was ’

no suspicion that the targets would
commit any crimes, Manifesto

argued. He cited the case of former I

senator of New Jersey Harrison Wil-
liams. It took a year, and seven or

Help for the c:autiousThanksgiving

(UPI) —— Turkey_ with dressing
and gravy is a traditional highlight
of _ many holiday feasts, yet most
often it is higher in salt and fat than
many diners would like to admit.

Goldie Silverman and Jacqueline
Williams, authors of a cookbook
called “Hold The Fat, Sugar and
Salt," take a fresh look at this slice of
Americana and come up with what
they consider a better way.

First, choose a turkey large
enough to feed your crowd with
some left over for sandwiches. Make
sure no salt or fat has been injected
and avoid the kind that is “self-
basting.”

Prepare the turkey by first trim-
ming away all visible fat and excess
skin around the body cavity. If you
wish, also remove most skin from
the bird's back (the part on the bot-
tom when it pics on a roastingpan).

Rinse the turkey cavity and dry it
with paper towels. Do not salt it or
rub it with butter or fat. Place a
whole orange or an onion, or both,
inside for extra flavor, then pierce

the skin all over with a fork to allow
the fat to drain off as the bird cooks.
Place the turkey on a rack in a

roasting pan to prevent cooking in _‘

its own fat. Roast according to

standard time and temperature ,

charts. When the bird is finished,
transfer it to a heated platter and
cover with foil to keep it warm. ’
The stuffing roasts alongside the
turkey rather than inside, so it is
virtually fat free. Make your own
bread cubes from good sourdough
or whole-wheat bread to avoid the
extra salt in commercial stuffing
mixes. Those on salt-free diets
should also use salt-free bread.
The other ingredients include:

— 8-l0 cups cubed stale bread
—- one medium onion, chopped
.one or two cloves garlic,

— one tablespoon sunflower oil

—— one-half teaspoon each: sage,
thyme, oregano and margarine

Finally, pour the drippings caught

Unchecked

The University of Pittsburgh appears to think of itself
as a miniature of the United States of America. It has a
University Senate, a Supreme Court-like Board of Trus-
tees, a President (complete with advisors, and sundry vice
presidents), and a body which mirrors the American
rabble —— students. Beyond these, there are disquieting
similarities which exist between President Posvar and
President Reagan. And, finally, there is the apparently
widening gulf between the governed and the governing

administration.

When the university announced, only two years aftera
gross expenditure of funds for the alleged beautification
of the Student Union, that it has considered cutting the
CAS budget by 25%, the governed did nothing. When the
administration appointed Mr. Detre to the post of Vice
President in charge of Health Sciences without even the
appearance of having conducted a search for other candi-
dates for the position, the governed did nothing. When
the administration raised tuition in the face of the fact
that enrollment has increased steadily, the governed did
nothing. One cannot reasonably‘ escape the feeling that
the governed feel powerless to in any way determine -the '
destiny of their own university.

Operatingon the assumption that the official univer-
sity thinks of itself as nothng less than a shrunken United
States, the student body can only effectively deal with it
on that basis. To do so, the student body might look to
the American Declaration of Independence. The Decla-
ration of Independence — that document on which the
development of the United States was based —— clearly

V states that if a government ceases to act in the full inter-
ests of its people, it is the right and duty of that people to
overthrow it. The document states that such action is
possible because power ﬂows up from the people,.not

down from the government.

So it is with the University of Pittsburgh and its stu-
dents. We, the students, pay for all that is done by the
university, whether in the form of tuition or taxes. It is the
administration which works for the students, not the
reverse. Given these necessary truths, we call for the end
of complacency and the beginning of what is right.

I Students

Count First .

Your editorial “A Call to Arms”
was succinctly put! The students,
faculty and staff are indeed the body
and heart of the institution and we
are all guilty of “unintentionally”
letting administration do with us as
they please.

We are all in a rat race — the

. students with trying to learn, the

faculty" with trying to teach, and the
staff with trying to make things run
smoothly for the faculty and the stu-
dents. Yet without.th_e students there
would be no need for the institution,
and it would cease to exist.

It's too bad that we permit the
administrators .- to put so much
emphasis on research and so little on
teaching, which should be the pri-
mary goal and which is what the
students pay for and which the

- faculty, staff and administrators get

paid from.

Seriously
Foolish

After reading Michael Flanigan's
letter entitled "Eat Crow," my first
impression was that he wasn't
seriously criticizing Walter Mon-

dale, Jimmy Carter, liberals and The -

Pitt News. Rather, he was merely
showing us, in a sarcastic manner,
just how ignorant one sounds when
he resorts to name calling because he
has nothing of any real importance
to say. Then, after reading the letter
for the third time, it occurred to me
that he wasn’t just joking — he was
- serious. » — ,

The fact that Flanigan voiced his
less than ﬂattering opinions of Mon-
dale, Carter, The Pitt News and lib-
erals in general was not so bad. As a
matter of fact it was good. We all
have our own_opinions and it is our
right to voice them. What was bad
was the way in which he went about
voicing those opinions.

To say that Flanigan came off as
having absolutely no class or intelli-
gence is to treat him kindly. Such

. wonderfully enlightened political
evaluations as “Carter is a female”
and “Mondale is a wimp" go to show
just how well versed he is in this area.
If anything, these comments remind
me of the childish cuts I used to hear

Needs Logic

‘After reading Michael Flanigan’s
letter of Nov.l9,I was moved -to
respond.‘critically to his views. A
brief examination of his letter, how-
ever, reveals it to be rash, immature,
and irresponsible, and therefore
undeserving of critical attention.

Instead, I have a sincere sugges-
tion to Mr. Flanigan: the next time
you are compelled to present a posi-
tion for which you stand, consider
using a logical, rational_basis to sup-

. port views in place of disorganized

slurs and name calling. A rational
approach, one which utilizes unbi-
ased observation, principles ‘of logic,
and subsequent application of those
principles is both preferred and

respected in our society. The use of
them to support a position is gener-
ally more effective than any other
approach, especially concerning
political issues.

“Few families join hands in giving

Another bothersome statement

I have to respond to the letter by
Michael T. Flanigan? in the
November 19 issue of The Pitt News.
Mr. F lanigan was really having a fun
time calling Mr. Mondale a wimp.
Perhaps Mr. Flanigan will have a
“chance to prove he is not a wimp
when that right-wing cretin Ronald
Reagan drafts Mr. Flanigan to fight
in Nicaragua or El Salvador. _

I hope you have fun, Mr. Flani-

gan, proving you're not a wimp by -

Statist
Economlcs

After reading and hearing about
the Catholic bishops" proposals on
the economy, I concluded that they
must be men of little or no intelli-
gence. The letter is a mass of con-
fused ideas, ~contradictions and
undefined terms. But I was wrong.
The problem is not that they are
unintelligent, the problem is that
they are immoral.

When they state “The economy
was made for all people,” I have to
agree. But what they really mean is:
“The economy is made for some
people at the expense of other peo-
ple." They do not seek voluntary aid
for the poor, they seek to have
government forcegpeople to give.
_Call this redistribution of wealth. or
whatever, it amounts to taxes, i.e.
confiscation of a man's property
without his consent through the
means of physical violence. Is this
what ‘they consider mora ? '

I also take issue to the statement

‘ that all economic decisions be made

.under the assumption that they must
be at the service of human beings.
Which human beings? When I work,

I do so only to further my life by ‘

providing services for people who
give me value for value, i.e. those
who pay me. I do not work for peo-

’,ple who don’t pay me. I refuse to live ,

by the assumption that I have any
obligation to provide services to
those who can't . pay me. The

- Catholic bishops "want the govern-

ment to force me’ to act on the above
assumption. Is this what_ they con-
sider moral? .

If through voluntary agreement
with the people I trade with, I amass
fortune,.it is mine by a right, every
pennyof it. There-is no higher prin-
ciple than this. The principle that is
is mine by “stewardship” andjthat I
must accept ‘a “social mortgage” is
the principle of a robber, the only
difference being’ a robber doesn't
demand that I agree it’s his right.

‘ The bishops claim that “the church's

teaching opposes collectivist and
statist approaches,” but this is
exactly a collectivist, statist
approach.

I suggest that every honest man
read the Catholic. bishops’ letter

again; it’s not often that one comes _

face to face with naked stinking evil.

Poor Coverage

I

While I realize that complaining
about the quality, of the writing in
The Pitt News‘ has become almost a
cliche, I feel forced to say that your
article, “Anti- and Pro-Choice

Speakers Debate” (Nov. l6), has to -
be the most inaccurate article that I ~

have seen this year.
First of all, who was‘ the “pro-
choice spea‘ker?"_And where was the

“debate”? I almost believed that _

your reporter could _ not. have
attended the same talk, “Abortion:
Two Views,” that I did. But this was
not the case. , ,

While your article did a fairly

accurate job of reporting Dr._

McGarvey’s medical oppositio_n to
abortion, it only got away with
labeling Ms. Beddingﬁeld as “pro-
choice” by omitting any coverage of
the content of .her talk at all. _
Ms. Beddingfield explained her
opposition to abortion not only on
the stand that unborn children are

fully human, but also on the stand .

that abortion exploits_women. r
She cited herself as an example,
reporting that the counseling session
before her own abortion “was a
joke’? that “lasted five minutes.”

_ tion -caused the miscarriages‘ of her_

ment in the nationwide Women
Exploited by Abortion helped her to
overcome her guilt, she said.

This is a “pro-choice speaker"?

The question, however, remains:
Why was Ms. Beddingfield’s talk not
covered by The Pitt News? Did the
reporter fall asleep? Or did the editor
cut out the second half of the article
without regard to its content?

On" a darker note, if The Pitt News _

does not correct its errors, some of
its readers may conclude that its
errors were deliberate, possibly out
of prejudice against Ms. Bedding-
field‘s views or against Ms. Bedding-
field herself, since she ‘ is both a
woman and black. ‘

Either of these possibilities would
seriously impeach the credibility of
The Pitt News.

Police Problem

Your article of Nov. 2 about the
Pitt campus police left me feeling
uncomfortable. I’m amazed that the
Pitt campus cops don’t have to
undergo the same type of psycholog-
ical screening that city police do.

I’m also amazed that only felonies
on an applicant’s record could keep
him from being hired for the campus
police’ and that campus police can
have 'a record of misdemeanors and
still be on the force. I wonder how
many campus police have been con-
victed of misdemeanors and served
time_in prison for those crimes.

I feel that ‘the administration
should make public the criminal
records of campus police and specif-

I ically what the offenses are, so that

the students will know what to

e expect from the campuspolice. The.

old question: “Who will guard us

from the guardians?” certainly

seems to apply to the Pitt campus
police.

Of the 70 students quizzed, more
than 40 were unable to identify half

the list were far from being obscure,
and the results of the quiz betray a

How can these students aspire toia

I am compelled to write this letter
because of the inappropriate behav-
ior that I observed last Friday (Nov.
9) during the screening of “Liquid
Sky” at the Pittsburgh Playhouse
Theater.

I strongly believe several of the
perpetrators of this behavior‘to be
Pitt undergraduatestudents, and I
direct my observations to them.

Isukerman’s vision is certainly
peculiar by anyone’s standards.
There are those who see the film and
find it artful; others, pretentious. I
happen to belong to the former cate-
gory, but my stance in no way influ-
ences my outrage at adults who are
compelled to make audible their
anxieties about lifestyles alien to
their own. Nor do I think rape is a
humorous subject, regardless of
context.

Those in attendance will under-
stand my dismay at this primal
approach to cinema. “

Most upsetting.was your reaction
to the'images of violence that the
director employed in his tale. I sup-

_ pose some of you have been desen-

sitized by years of television viewing.
Others, perhaps, equated the_ non-
conformity of the characters with
negative values. Regardless, your
behavior was not only inconsiderate
of those of us interested in the film
but-ignorant in every sense of that
word. '

Next Two Years Crucial    

The Reagan administration has
two years to confront the ‘many
problems before it, and only_ two
years. Expect an immediate ﬂurryof
activity aimed at reducing the deficit
and reaching a limited detente with
the Soviet- Union.

In 1986, a new round of con-
gressional elections will mean that
politicking will dominate over
policy-making as the main function
of government officials. These elec-
tions affect, and will be affected by,
the White House. If Reagan, has a
successful two years — that is, if his
public approval ratings are high -
tnen more Republicans will assume
congressional office. This will help
Reagan further his own agenda. But
consider:

If Reagan's term to l986 is viewed
as'* successful,’ then he will have
begun to reduce the deficit and will
have lessened tensions with the
Soviets. With such successes, his
incentive to progress beyond these
basic goals will be dramatically
reduced. Instead, he will likely
choose to “stay the course,”and,pre-
side over the land as Eisenhower did
in his ﬁnal years — in a benign
grandfather mode. ‘

Secondly, by I986 politicians
from both parties will begin cam-
paigns for the office of the presiden-
cy itself. Republicans will vie for
Reagan's blessing and try to close
the moderate/ radical schism which
presently divides the party. Demo-
crats, of course, will be ’_Democrats.

' Thirdly, Reagan will be a lame-'

duck president. There may be, by
I986, an East-West accommodation
of some sort. But further progress in
this area will be put on hold as the
Soviets await the results of the 1988
elections. This would suit the pres-
ent White House occupant just fine.
From Reagan's perspective, so long
as relations are under’ control, we
and the Soviets need not be bed-
fellows. Again, Eisenhoweritis.
What if, by I986, Reagan fails to
reduce both deficits and tensions?
Reagan may tell us things are better

anyway, hoping to inﬂuence the
1986 elections. Or, he may concede
that yes, things are bad, but deflect

A‘ blame to the Congress, whom he will

paint as obstructionist. He will call
for a Republican majority to carry
out his agenda. However, regardless

of the makeup of the post-1986 Con- ‘ I I I

gress, lame-duckitis will set in -and
not much will happen.

In either case, if Reagan’s next
two years are viewed by the elector-
ate as a failure, then the House will
go further Democratic, and the
Republican majority in the Senate
will dwindle or even turn over.
Executive-legislative bickering will
lead to policy paralysis and animos-
ity. The government and media will
focus on I988.

With no limited ‘East-West
detente, the Soviets will simply give
up on Ronald. Reagan and await
I988. Tensions may at thattime

escalate as the Soviets adopt an-.
increasingly militaristic tone. Rea-g
gan‘s Soviet policy will of necessity“ V

be geared toward calming his critics
at home and abroad. His foreign
policy, being judged so heavily on

East-West relations, will lose its-,
. credibility at home. The presidential '

contenders will all argue about how

much better things will be once they .

are in office. ’ _ '

In short, the last two years of the
Reagan presidency_ will see policy
paralysis born of lame-duckitis,
whetherhis next two years are seen
as a success or failure. Expect imme-
diate efforts to reduce the deficit and
tensions with the Soviets. To
address the former, we will see var-
ious “revenue-enhancers" — tax
increases. To handle the latter,
expect a flurry of arms control activ-
ity, that.being the yardstick by" which

U.S..-Soviet relations are (myopi-

cally) judged.
Reagan is a political realist who
recognizes that his new term is not

four years, but half that. His actions.

in the next few months become all

the more crucial. I986 is not that far,

international event

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

Pittsburgh is preparing for what
may be its most significant interna-
tional event this season, maybe even
this year, with the visit of the Japa-
nese All-Star Gymnastics Team.
The preparations for this Pitt event
stretch further than just Pitt’s
Athletic Association and the Asian

week, Mayor Richard Caliguiri
announced that November 30, the
day Pitt’s men’s and women's gym-
nasticteams meet with the Japanese
teams in Fitzgerald Field House,
will be “Pitt International Gymnas-
tics Classic Day" in Pittsburgh.

Rich Talarico, assistant to the
mayor, felt that the meet signifies a"

' major international affair for Pitts-

burgh. “It’s a great chance for Pitts-
burghers to witness an international
- gymnastics event,” said Talarico,
citing the special interest in gymnas-
tics in the United States after the
successful Summer Olympic Games
in Los Angeles this year. “We’re
behind the university in bringing a
top-rate event to the city.”

The Japanese team taking part in
next F riday’s meet is especially sur-
prising in its composition. With only
a few months passed since the end of
the Olympics, the Japanese team vis-

iting Pitt is _a true representation of
the country’s talent. The head of the
women's delegation, Masu Wata-
nabe, came to the United States in
1973 to promote and instruct gym-
nastics here at a time when the U.S.
was weak and’ the Japanese were
leaders in the event. The men’s team
includes I984 Olympic team
member Hiroyuki Kato.

The point of having an interna-
tional event, according to both
Donna Sanft and Carol Sprague of
Pitt’s athletic department, is notjust
for athletic purposes,_ but for cultur-
al ones also. Pitt’s gymnasts were all
supplied language and cultural
information concerning Japan and
its people, with the primary goal of,
successfully hosting a representative
group from a foreign nation. ;I'he
reading list submitted by the Asian
Studies Program at Pitt included

“Background Notes," published by’

the Department of Education, and
“Culturegrams" by professors at
Brigham Young University. Fran-
cine Dennis, assistant director of
Asian Studies at Pitt, and herself a

' national gymnast in 1954, stated the

importance of their role in the occa-
sion: “We’re— here to provide infor-
mation on protocol, cultural
background and translation, which
are vital at such an international
event.” '

Believe it or not, basketball
coach Roy Chipman is preparing .
to recruit this year’s high school
junior classes. That’s because
after signing two seniors yester-
day he has only one scholarship
left for next season.

Jerome Lane, a 6-6, 195-lb.
forward from St. Vincent-St.
Marie High School in Akron,
Ohio, has been ranked as the
12th best prepster by The Sport-
ing News and is generally consid-
ere._c_i one of the top 15 players in
the nation by most scouting ser-
vices. Lane averaged 21.5 points

Chipman

and 11.5 rebounds per game as a
junior and led his squad to a 23-4
record and a Class AA state
championship.

Steve Maslek, a6-8, 215-lb.
center from Freedom Area High
School, averaged 13.6 points,
11.4 rebounds and four blocked
shots per game last season for
coach Bob Gallagher.

Maslek continues to grow. In
the last two years he's added 7-
1/4 inches to his frame, five of

‘those in the past year. “I never

realized he had grown so much,” _

Chipman said yesterday.

Lane and Maslek join Mike
Good_son, a 6-3 guard from Eliz-
abeth, N.J., as players whom

- Chipman has signed in the early
signing period. _ —

Those; new recruits will have
the distinct pleasure of attending
such inviting Christmas tourna-
ments as the Sugar Bowl Classic,
the Rainbow Classic and the _Cit-
rus Bowl Tournament in 1985-
87. In the meantime, Pitt has
worked out a planwith Tulane,

Oklahoma State and Robert
Morris to hold the previous
Golden Triangle Tournament in
Fitzgerald. Field House Dec. 28-
29.

The Golden Triangle Associa-
tion recently admitted defaulting
on financial obligations to Bay-
lorand Illinois State, two teams
participating in last year's Civic
Arena tourney. It also cannot
guarantee financial commit-
ments next month. '

To avoid losing two scheduled
games, the four schools sched-
uled to play in this year’s Golden

Triangle Tournament agreed to ‘
participate in the Pittsburgh
Holiday Tournament. It will rely
mostly on corporate sponsorship
to keep it solvent.

Tulane will face Oklahoma
State at 7 p.m. with the Panthers
facing Robert Morris at 9 pm. 1.
on Dec. 28. Consolation and
championship rounds will be

Strang's record is even more

yet to throw for 200 yards in one
game and has completed only 38.7

the ball (Strang fourth behind Doz-

“Watching them over the year,”
Fazio said, “the thing [the quarter-

he has the speed and is tough to stop.

Followers of the Panthers have
tried — mostly in vain — to detect a
pulse in the football team all year
long. Their efforts often thwarted,
they pursue other interests. There's’
no hedging: either you're a fan or a
defector.

In Penn State, nothing's been
quite so clean-cut. At the base of Mt.
Nittany, distress comes from folks
uncertain about whether they

’ has been a peripatetic season at best.

make,” Paterno said. “I didn't care
what they did. I think there aresome
people who took a stand when
there's TV and when there’s not TV.
I’m glad to see our people doing it.”

Later, Paterno added, ‘‘I’m tired
of seeing people upset that there’s no
TV. They don’t go to the games in
the first place. Why should they be
upset? I don’t think we have an obli-
gation to [TV] for Pitt because of the
lack of support their fans have given
them. With the tradition of good
college football in Pittsburgh, the
team has one bad year and they pull
out. I can’t have any sympathy for
fans like that.”

TV or not, a game still has to be
played. Players from both" sides

 

\

Congemi’s no better, except that
he’s healthy now and perhaps cause
for the edge. But he started healthy
against Tulane and only shined dur-
ing the second half of the second
quarter. .

Both have been replaced, by Chris
Jelic and John Shaffer respectively.
Again, the similarities are unmistak-
able. Both need the experience to
lead their teams effectively. It's a

toss-up here and hope for no iiiter-_

ceptions, l4 of which the two share.

Wideouts: Some say Kenny Jack-
son's leaving as the Eagles’ No. 1
draft pick made Strang a poorer
passer now. Others say Bill Wallace
has failed to achieve last year's glory
— especially 173 yards against the
Lions — this year because Congem-
i's been so battered about.

This is certain: Jackson's gone
and Wallace has one game left. Pitt
will need to capitalize on the
Wallace-Congemi success against
Tulane. If not, Penn State's split end
Herb Bellamy, the surprising fresh-
man with 16 catches and a 19.1-yard
average, will take the Panthers to the
well.

_, Or Strang could go to Rocky

.Washington, the senior ﬂanker with

the extra year eligibility, who's
repaid Paterno forgthe coach's loy-

, two. Though the rushing and pass-

ing numbers for the two teams com-
pare equally, the experience factor
falls in Sapio’s and ,Doleman's laps.

Plus the two,.in addition to the
consistent pressure by middle men
Dennis Atiyeh and Walter Johnson,
aren't so likely to give up the sudden
offensive spurts opposing teams
have garnered against Penn State.
Give the edge to Doleman, Sapio,
Atiyeh and Johnson.

Linebackers: It's as if Troy Ben-
son and Caesar Aldisert never knew
there was an off-season. Both have
been playing that well. So, too, have
Penn State's big three: Shane Con-
lan, Rogers Alexander and Don

They’re still’ underclassmen, but

teams play against the run and pass

(pleasant ones, anyway) in the ’84
closet. For some, though, something
will stick in their minds about Satur-
day's version of the two sides’ oldest
rivalry. »
Here's how it'll lo_ok beforehand:

OFFENSE "

Backiield: ‘Tis the tale of ‘othe
underclassmen that fits. Were it not
for their uniforms, you'd think Pitt’s
Craig “lronhead” Heyward and
Penn State's D.J. Dozier were one in

the same. Both exude thundering

styles and generally excel better
around either side. But Dozier, ever
since the Rutgers game, has been
bothered by a groin .pull.

His only claim to fame this year
has been consecutive I00-yard
games against Syracuse, West Virgi-
nia and Boston College.

Heyward leads the Panthers with
501 yards and has the capable
backup in fellow freshman Charles
Gladman, just as Dozier does in
Tony Mumford.

Because Dozier was limited to 44

yards in 10 carries last week and con- '

stantly ails, the Pitt duo gets the slim
edge here.

At fullback no doubt Marlon
Mclntyre and Marc Bailey have
more experience than the sopho-
mores,_ Steve Smith and Tim
Manoa. Smith will start, but how
does one top Bailey's fourth-
standing 218 all-purpose yards or
McIntyre's, near-five yards per

carry? This, despite their alternat-_

ing, gives Mclntyre and Bailey the
edge. _
Quarterback: Refrain from the
urge to skip the two regulars here.
John Congemi and Doug Strang
have been that unimpressive this

year.
While their numbers look identi-
cal — identically sour — Strang

unaccountably has trouble hitting
Penn State receivers. True, bruised
ribs suffered at Iowa made for pun-
ishing tackles that also forced
Strang’s removal, particularly
against Texas and Alabama. ' His

there against Oklahoma.

Problem is, it's hard to find appeal
here, since Paterno inserted seven or
eight receivers constantly. The
uncertainty clears when tight end
focuses in. Junior Dean Dimidio has
caught only nine" passes for. 154

- yards, for his blocking often pre-

cludes his running pass routes. Right
behind is Brian Siverling, a monster
at 6-7, 242. With Clint Wilson red-

shirted, Pitt never saw its tight‘ ends .

develop as blockers or receivers.
Give the edge to Bellamy, Washing-
ton. Dimidio and Siverling.

Bill F ralic: Before getting on with
the line, it’s' already apparent its one
member, the tackle, is no ordinary
lineman. Obviously the edge goes to
F ralic, but it is informative to know
that sophomore Dan Mo_rgan (6-6,
263) bothers the All-America this
week. _ - 1

Plus, it's colorful to spotlight

what thehulk has to say before his ‘

last game during a 2-7-1 season. “I
don’t think losing builds character at
all," Fralic said. “A team should
have character going into the sea-
son. You should be able to handle
losing. I really don't know what los-
ing teaches you. I haven't really

» learned anything except who my real

friends are.”

Line: Guards Greg Christy and
Mike Dorundo are back as starters
after knee injuries earlier in the sea-
son, giving Pitt the strength it was
supposed to have all season. Center
Barry Pettyjohn is strong again after
a hyperextended elbow sidelined
him in October."

Penn‘, State linemen like Stan‘

Short (their Bill Fralic) and Jeff
Woofter, two mammothseniors,
have been afflicted, as have others

‘with various hamstring problems

earlier. t
, The line has since stabilized itself.-

. But none was supposed to compare‘

to Pitt’s in September. Now the
Lions get over 200 rushing yards per
game as opposed to Pitt’s 152. It can
be the difference. Give the edge to
Short & Co.

DEFENSE .

Line: There's something wrong
when your rush- or dropends aren't
even listed among the top ﬁve or six
tacklers. Penn State will probably
start Bob White and Dan Morgan
there —— fortunately for Pitt. White
doesn't tackle very much (32, good
enough for ninth) but leads with
seven sacks. Morgan has three sacks

The Pitt News

When Pitt and Penn State take

, the ﬁeld Saturday at State College,

the game will not be played for the
national championship. It will not
be played for the Lambert Trophy‘
either. It will be played for pride.
“We are definitely going to throw

1 the records out," said Nittany Lion

linebacker Carmen Masciantonio, a
defensive captain.,“This is a big col-
lege football rivalry.” -

Penn State will be looking to

increase its record to 7-4 in hopes of _

keeping the possibility of a post-
season bowl game alive. “It doesn't
look too promising right now,” said
Masciantonio, “but we'll be ready.”
Penn State _hopes to bounce back
from a 44-7 defeat at the hands of
Notre Dame. The Nittany Lions:
were dominated in practically every’
phase of the game against the Fight-
ing lrish, but Masciantonio is conﬁ-
dent that Penri State will return to
competition intact. ‘
“Against Notre Dame, we had
some things go wrong early, and we
never recovered. It was kind of a
snowball effect. The team was down
for a bit after Notre Dame; but the

excitement of the Pitt game has ,

brought us‘ back to reality._,We'll be

par record could be deceiving. “Pitt

will be ready. They have improved ’ .

these last few weeks. They beat

I Tulane, and they lost a couple games

in the last minute. They have good’

Masciantoniois having what he
called‘ a “down year," but he has per.-
formed well -enough to record 27
tackles, including 18 solos, and one
sack. He and his linebacker mates

. will have to play well to stop Pitt.

“Pitt is basically a running team, and

we don’t expect them to change,” he

said. _ '
Masciantonio cited fellow line-

‘backer Shane Conlan and right

tackle Todd Moules for their play so
far this season but cautioned that.

"this will not be easy for the Nittany _-

‘Lions. “Pitt has a real good offensive
line,” he said. “It's a matter of who

have a two-game lead in the AFC
Central with only four games to go.

I would have to rate the Steelers’
chances in the playoffs as slim to
none, but then again, the worst
record I can remember that ever won
a division was the Los Angeles
Rams’ in 1979 with a record of 9-7,
and they went on to give the Pitts-
burgh Steelers fits for three quarters
in the Super Bowl before becoming
the Steelers’ fourth victim.

So while their 6-6 record may not
glitter, there are 22 other teams that
would give their eyeteeth to be in
Pittsburgh's shoes. _ ‘

Not only did Penn State make an

' awful lot of people unhappy by re-

fusing to allow TV coverage of Sat-
urday‘s Pitt-Penn State battle
because they feared overexposure,
but they had to stand by and watch
while the Nittany Lions were
exposed and deposed by Notre
Dame. It looks like their TV black-

Blair. “His determination won't let
down,“ Krug said. “He has
‘improved tremendously since last
year, mainly in his rip entry tech-
nique. He is getting progressively
stronger. When his back is in full
strength, Chris Blair will be a diver
to be reckoned with. He's tough as
nails.” '

Blair’s interest in diving began at
the early age of eight. He was also
involved in swimming and gymnas-
tics up until eighth grade. Blair
explained, “It wasn't until my
sophomore year in high school that I
decided to stick to the diving and
joined Coach Krug’s Pitt Aquatic
Club for kids under 17.” - ~

Because Freeport High School
‘lacked pool facilities, Blair’s early
involvement with Coach Krug
proved an invaluableinfluence on
his decision to attend Pitt. His stats
in themselves are indicative of his
talent.
America, Chris was among the top
30 divers inthe country. He also
boasts a fourth- and ﬁfth-place fin-
ish in the 3-meter and l-meter diving
events in the Big East last year.-

As is the case with any dedicated
athlete, practice makes perfect. “We
practice four to ﬁve hours a day,"
Blair remarked. “It's fun, but hard

out came one game too late.

0 Be thankful that if you are abear

as hunting season ended yesterday.

0 Be thankful that the Panther
football season ends on Saturday.

This long and troubled football
season is best put behind us sothat
next season can be concentrated on,
and the mistakes of the past can be
forgotten.

0 Be thankful for the Pittsburgh
Penguins.

I know you may be thinking that I

am thankful that the Penguins are in
Pittsburgh. So far, this season has
brought different things to the Civic
Arena: new faces, for instance. With

work comes first. We puta lot of
effort into it." Krug feels that hard
‘ work caught up with Blair last sea-
son as the tough schedule and con-
stant training began to wear him

down andpossibly contributed to _

his back injury. ‘
Nonetheless, both see a successful

future for Blair. Said Krug, “Chris

could very well be a leader on most

other teams in the East if it weren’t,

for our strong team this year.”

Blair admitted, “I would love to
be an All-America.”

As with all successful divers, the
key to Blair’s productive ability is
good coaching. As a diver himself,
Coach Krug relates to his divers,
having been himself in similar situa-
tions. “Coach has been a huge inﬂu-
ence on the entire team. He's both a
coach and a friend. We’re lucky to
have him,” Blair said.

Although Blair is temporarily
sidelined, the men's diving team

promises a very successful season. V

Krug maintained that hard work

and unlimited potential are two key -

factors to the success of the team.
“At this point in the season, I feel

this team has been the best varsity'

team I have ever coached, with con-
ceivable potential for both men and
women All-Americas."

Collier. “She is very coachable
and a dedicated athlete."

National winners will be
announced before Nov. 21.

District 11 is comprised of
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Dela-
ware, Washington, D.C.,
Maryland and West Virginia. To
qualify, an athlete must have
above a 3.2 grade point average
and be a starter or valuable
reserve.

“Sally is a really important
factor on our team not only
because of her effort this year but
because of our loss in the Big
East championships last year,"
Collier continued. “After that,
she took responsibility and made
sure that we won this year. She’s
such a leader, and the whole
team plays better when she's in
the lineup.”

Gillespie’s study habits carry
over to the court, where Collier

plans and scouting reports more
than anyone else on the team.

“She’s made a 100 percent
commitment to the team and fits
in so well because she has the
type of personality which allows
her to get along with many differ-
ent types of people,” said Collier.

The Lady Panthers’ victory
over Penn State was an impor-
tant home win for the team in
October, and Gillespie played an
importantrole in that match.
She started the game and her
inﬂuence helped to lead the team
to a very exciting and meaningful

said. “Not many of them will "be

Sue reacted real well to the stress

Collier said that Hoover, despite
