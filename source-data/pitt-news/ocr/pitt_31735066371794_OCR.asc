Professor confronts racist folly

By Vicki Zeltner
The Pitt News

Dr. Barbara A. Sizemore, a pro-
fessor of black studies, inspired an
audience of approximately 50 peo-
ple with a powerful message on “The
Politics of Seeking Peace — the
Bomb, Apartheid and Institutional
Racism” last night in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom. Sponsored by
the University of Pittsburgh's Chap-
lain Association, Sizemore’s lecture
comprehensively covered racism as

by Dr. Mark Rose at Children’s
Hospital. I
0 Wright underwent her first trans-
plant on Feb. 15 and the second on
Feb. 22.

“We used a questionable donor,”
said Dr. Starzl. Apparently, the pro-
cured liver was twice the size needed
for Wright. “We could not close the
wound,” he said. “She is a sick little
baby.”

Wright is only one of the 135
patients at Children’s Hospital since
May 1, 1981 to undergo transplant
surgery.

“There is reasonable hope,” said

Organ transplants forge new dimension in medicine

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

There is a whole new dimension in
medicine due to the profound
changes in organ transplantation,
according to Dr. Thomas Starzl,
who lectured at the Learning
Research and Development Center
yesterday afternoon.

Starzl spoke about the current
state of organ transplantation at the
lecture sponsored by Phi Beta
Kappa.

Bethlehem Haven offers comfort to the

Highly respected among col-
leagues and students for her knowl-
edge, dynamic character and wit,
Sizemore responded, when chosen
as this year’s lecturer for “An Explo-
ration of Racism in the University”
that she “was threatened with the
fear that I would be unable to pro-
vide an informative and motivating
context by which the community
could more effectively address the
issue of human dignity and justice.”

“Whenever I see racism,” voiced
the petite professor in a challenging
spirit, “I confront it.” Struggle and

direct confrontation, urged Size-»

more. “are imperative if the quality

of life is to improve for all man-
kind.“ She referred to the theme of
author/ historian Barbara Tuchman
who, in “The March of Folly,”
pursued the point that decisions
contrary to the best interests of the
constituency or state are not rational
but folly. “Anytime people are
denied life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness," said Sizemore,
“attempts will be made to overthrow
these chains either by violence or

nonviolence. It is folly to believe

otherwise, and the whole of man-
kind’s history is a testimonial to such
efforts.”

Sizemore differentiated at least
two kinds of racism which people

tion is only a recent development. In
the future we -will be looking at
changes in the philosophy of medi-

- cine,” stated Starzl.

Starzl joined the faculty at Pitt in
1981 as a professor of surgery. For
the past 25 years, he has been an
expert in organ transplantation and
an authority on liver transplanta-
tions.

Starzl spoke about four issues of
current concern in organ transplan-
tation: rejection (the refusal of the
body to accept the organ), organ
prevention and procurement, typing
(matching recipient to donor) and
the ethical considerations of organ
transplantation.

In a study conducted in 1962 at

the University of Colorado, new
drugs made possible the survival of
kidney transplantation by reversing
the rejection.

“Patients in the 1962 study repre-
sented a fundamental change in the
adaptation of organ transplanta-
tion,” Starzl stated. “In fact, seven
out of 10 patients in the study are
alive today.

“A man," Starzl continued,
“whose body was initially not
accepting the new organ was so con-
vinced of his imminent doom that he
attempted to commit suicide. We
reversed the rejection process, and
today he is living happily, with a
couple of children.”

There is resistance to change

often confuse: individual and insti-

tutional. She explained that under,
the Reagan administration we have

seen a “return of a more subtle form

of Jim Crow, enforced by tradition

and custom rather than by law."

In addressing the efforts of under-
developed countries to establish
national autonomy and freedom
from internal and external oppres-
sion, Sizemore referred to an old
Haitian proverb: “When the ele-
phants fight, the grass is trampled.”
“Politics is conflict,” she said, and
expressed the warning of Frederick
Douglas that power concedes
nothing without demand.

“South Africans and oppressed
people in the majority such as in
Brazil," Sizemore maintained,
“must make it more costly to deprive
them of their human, civil, social
and political rights. They must
behave in a way that will demand a
huge occupational force, making
their oppression too costly to con-
tinue. Compliance and accomoda-
tion will not defeat racism and
terrorism. Only struggle can bring
victory.

“US. investment in South
Africa,” declared Sizemore, “sup-
ports the most oppressive, repre-
hensible government on earth.” The
professor charged that the compan-
ies with investment in South Africa,
such as Borg-Warner, Motorola and
International Harvester, “are more
afraid of offending their powerful
host government than of offending
powerless blacks.” Sizemore
believes that South Africa “con-
tinues to be the most serious threat
to peace in the world, next to the
Palestinian question.”

Solutions to the problem of
empowerment of African-
Americans exist, asserted Sizemore,
but are often controversial and may
challenge cherished values. The
“dream of integration” expressed by
Dr.’ Martin Luther King in 1963 is
still held high, though empower-
ment, she explained, “results from
consensus or a sticking together, a

I form of separation.” Sizemore rec-

ognized that bringing these two

notions together into an applicable

program is extremely difficult.
Sizemore applied this problem to

within the medical community,
according to Starzl. “For instance,”
he said, “when we tried the new drug
cyclosporin and (used it with a ster-
oid, this increased the survival of the
patient after organ transplantation. ”

He also said some physicians critic-

ized this new technique. _

However, despite the strides to
limit change, since the “era of under-
standing" (the years after 1958), new
techniques in controlling rejection
have occurred and will continue to
do so.

The ability to cool the organs and
preserve them has made it possible
to ship the organs from city to city,
making it possible to save the life of
the organ recipient.

the election of blacks to the city
council in Pittsburgh. “In order to
get two or more African-Americans
on the city council,” said Sizemore,
they “will have to decide to vote for
blacks only! In this way, an African-
American independent candidate
will pile up enough African-
American votes [at least 25,000] to
win four seats on the city council.”
She explained that this notion is “so
alien to the cherished dream of inte-
gration” that it is “not saleable” in
the black community. Moreover,
she said, “a politician who heeds the
black vote cannot openly court it
without risking a white backlash.”

On the university level, Sizemore
pointed out that out of the 1,026
faculty in the health sciences during
the fall term, only 25 were black. “In
the School of Medicine in 1982, 7.65
percent of the tenured faculty was
minority.” These facts, she asserted,
“reflect the entire University of
Pittsburgh system.” She claimed
that affirmative action has done bet-
ter for white females than any
others.

“Clearly,” Sizemore said, “Jim
Crow, U.S.A.-style, is more subtle
than the blatant overt South African
type, but it is the same fruit from the
same tree.

“Divide and conquer,” the profes-
sor stated, “is one of the oldest and
most effective techniques in his-
tory.” Consensus, Sizemore sug-
gested, is the key to empowerment.

“However,” Starzl continued, “we
need better preservation
techniques."

The Pittsburgh technique was
finally developed to perform multi-
ple organ removals. According to
Starzl, this technique was used just
last night when a heart and liver
were transplanted in the same
recipient.

Starzl concluded the lecture by
illustrating the effects of the current
transplantation: “Diseases of the
liver and kidney used to pick off the
ﬂowers of our society, the young
people. What would have happened
if Mozart were around today if at 33,
instead of dying, he could have had a
transplantation?”

leges and students.

Bethlehem Haven shelters Pi

By Paul Guggina
For The Pitt News

In the long line of homeless men
and women dressed in the thread-
bare remains of overcoats, there is
little talking. They are a private
bunch. The only fragments of con-
versation are uttered as they each file
-— ladies first — past the woman
handing out the sandwiches.

“When’s the baby due?” some ask
her, just as they’ve been asking every
day since she began to show. “You
shouldn’t be outside in this cold.”

They are Pittsburgh’s street peo-
ple. Every day at this time, they line
up alongside St. Mary of Mercy’s
red-brick rectory building down-
town, where Carol Wallace, the
pregnant woman, and her volunteer
assistants distribute lunch.

Mrs. Wallace is a para-social
worker at the church and coordina-
tor of St. Mary's Red Door pro-
gram, which has been providing two
meals a day for the needy since 1930.

In addition to her work for the
Red Door program, Wallace is a
board member of the Bethelehem
Haven committee. The Bethlehem

Governor

BOSTON —~ Gov. Dick Thorn-
burgh Friday told a conference of
northeastern educators that “rival-
ries between so-called sunbelts and
frostbelt should be set aside in favor
of a ‘brain belt’ to widen economic
growth and diversification all across
America."

He added that higher education is
the key to such an effort and that our
colleges and universities should be
“challenged, as well as supported in
the pursuit of academic excellence.

“We must insist on excellence
from grade school through graduate
school," Thornburgh said. “Only in
this way will any of our states he

Haven committe, she explained,
oversees several shelter units
designed to help “not only the home-
less but anyone who can’t get welfare
or other assistance  to get back on

his feet again.” _ _
When -a man with a wine bottle

shows up at a newly-opened shelter
seeking refuge from the sub-freezing
cold, Wallace asks him, “Do you
want to sleep here tonight, or do you
want that bottle?

“I don’t want the shelter to’

become just a flop house where
anyone can come in and sleep for the
night, then take off,” she said. “We
set it up so there would be rules and
regulations."

No alcohol allowed is one ofthose
rules. Those wishing to’ stay the
night, will also “be expected to do
some work around the shelter in
return for the chance to sleep there,"
Wallace stated. “This gives them a
little responsibility besides just a
place to sleep.”

For her uncompromising auster-
ity, Wallace has earned the respect
of those she tries to help. She
recalled the day when a rather ineb-
riated gentleman began to loudly
malign her after she had asked him
to leave the church area where he
had been disturbing some of the par-

ishioners — and the man's compan-
ion admonished him. ‘.‘Don’t talk to
her like that," he scolded. “Carol
does a lot of good for us. You should
know that."

When Wallace first took the posi-
tion as Red Door coordinator ﬁve
years ago, the majority of her duties
consisted of referring the clientele to
other organizations. But unfortu-
nately, there was no place to send the
homeless; they were being shuffled
from church to church with nothing
of substance being done for them.

With Wallace’s assistance, the five
downtown-area churches (First
Presbyterian, Trinity Cathedral,
Smithfield United, First Lutheran
and St. Mary of Mercy) combined
their efforts to form the shelters.

Beforejoining St. Maryof Mercy,
Wallace taught at Pittsburgh-area
Catholic schools for 18 years. It was
during her last eight years of teach-
ing when she taught inner-city stu-
dents at a Braddock junior high
school that Wallace first began to
understand the serious problems of
the needy.

“The students ended up staying
after school,” she recalled, “simply
because there was no family life or
there were problems at home. We
had to throw the kids out at night —

“I don’t want the shelter to become just a flop house
where anyone can come in and sleep for the night, then

we had to say, ‘Please, go home.

Wallace then knew that she
wanted to work more with the needy
within the church, she said. The
position at St. Mary of Mercy gave
her a chance to “work with the
downtown people, with the street-
relationships, the really down-and-
out.”

Initially, Wallace’s first thought
was: “I ’m going to make a change in
these people’s lives." Things didn’t
go quite as well as she'd planned,
though. Wallace said she “slowly
realized — after failing five or six
times — that it’s useless. There is no
way to help them. They have to real-
ize that they want help, and that
they're going to change their own
way of life. All I could be was a
listener.”

According to Wallace, most of the
street people are alcoholics. They
save their pocket change until they
can afford a new bottle and then go

“State government must maintain
a partnership role with higher edu-
cation,” the governor continued,
addressing the participants in the
National Institute of Education’s
Northeast Regional Conference on
Quality in American Higher
Education.

Appointment of a new subcom-
mittee dominated last night’s meet-
ing of the Freshman Council. The
actual job ofthe committee, tempor-
arily entitled “Secretarial Commit-
tee,” is public relations. Secretary
Laura Simpson was appointed to
oversee the group.

The council also discussed the dis-
tribution ofa library survey focusing
on student opinion of the current
hours of operation at Hillman
Library. “Right now, the results are
positive,” said President Jim Gar-
boden. “Students want more library
hours, especially when ﬁnals come
up.”

In other business, the council is
considering the idea of a newsletter.
“What we want to do is to form new
ideas and keep the council going,”
stated public relations chairman
Macy Kisilinsky. The council is hop-
ing the newsletter will spark the
interest of incoming freshmen.

A Barbaric System

To divest, or not to divest. That is the question before the

university board of trustees.

A resolution adopted by the Student Government Board
condemning the system of apartheid practiced by the Republic
of South Africa was put before the board at its last meeting.
The resolution called for total divestment of university funds in
companies operating in South Africa. .

Judge Ruggero Aldisert, in presenting the resolution, stated
that the Sullivan principles are “not as valid" as they once were.
The Sullivan Principles, adopted by the university in 1978,
advocate that companies operating in South Africa actively
hire and promote blacks. Aldisert said that since the principles
are invalid, the best way for the university to combat apartheid

is to divest.

SGB member Avery Abrams announced a “major victory"
following the meeting and predicted that the board would
decide to divest by the time of its next scheduled meeting in
May. Perhaps Mr. Abrams was_ a bit ove_rly_ optimistic.

Chairman of the Board of Trustees Robert Kirby com-
mended the SGB and condemned apartheid. But he warned
against destroying the livelihood of South African blacks.

President Posvar said there is a record that the Sullivan
Principles have been helpful and that he has “not seen evidence
that the principles are not of some value.”

President Posvar further pointed out that Nobel laureate
Desmond Tutu called for continued investment in South
Africa as a means of providing blacks with some measure of
relief from official government persecution.

These statements by such prominent board members would
seem to foreshadow a negative response from the board to the
SGB resolution. But Bishop Tutu went on to say: “I give notice
that if by [18 months to two years] apartheid is not being
actively dismantled, I will myself call for punitive economic

sanctions."

This pragmatic approach by the bishoﬁ is wise. We know

from experience with the Soviet Union ’

at economic sanc-

tions are of little value. Sanctions would serve no purpose
except to worsen conditions for the already harshly oppressed

black majority in South Africa.

The Sullivan Principles are indeed valid. Many South Afri-
can blacks have experienced their first draught of equality
because of the principles. Yet we are caught in a dilemma. How
do we eliminate this barbaric system of apartheid? History
shows that violent revolution most often is the end result of

injustice.

Let us work to find a solution. With much respect to Bishop
Tutu, I8 months to two years is not soon enough.

AIDS Update

I am writing to clarify several

, parts of Tess Warner’s article of Feb.

22 concerning my “Ethics for
Lunch” presentation on AIDS.

First, the Centers for Disease
Control, and not French scientists,
have recently determined that
approximately I0 percent of gay
men who tiavegantibodies to the
virus HTLV-III will develop overt
AIDS within two to ﬁve years after
infection. This virus was discovered
by the French in 1983 and termed
LAV. LAV and HTLV-III are the
same virus and are considered to be
the cause of AIDS.

About three times this number, or
another 30 percent of the seroposi-
tive subjects, are likely to develop
AIDS—related complex. There is
about a 47-percent mortality in
patients with AIDS. ARC appears
to be self-limiting and non-life-
threatening. The remaining 60 per-
cent of the seropositive men appear
to be healthy.

It must be emphasized that this
CDC study focused on a group of
San Francisco gay men that could
differ substantially from gay men in
Pittsburgh or other geographic
locales. A specific aim of the Pitt
Men’s Study is to delineate similari-
ties and differences in various char-
acteristics of gay men in Pittsburgh
vs. such areas in San Francisco.
These may account for different
incidences of AIDS in these cities.
have antibodies to HTLV-III may
be carriers of the virus. However, as
I stressed in the presentation, we
have insufficient data to confirm
this. It may be that as with most
infectious. diseases, the majority of
seropositive men are immune to the
virus and are not infectious for oth-
ers. One of the major goals of the
Pitt Men's Study is to determine the
various outcomes of HTLV-III
infection.

In the presentation, I stated
clearly from I980 U.S. census fig-
ures that there are “25 million single,
never married men in the United
States," not 25 million men with
AIDS. I then speculated that 5 mil-
lion of these men were gay or bisex-
ual. This is a conservative figure.
Based on another conservative esti-
mate, I0 percent of these men
(500,000) have been infected with
HTLV-III. If the CDC study is cor-
rect, I0 percent of these infected
men, or 50,000, will develop AIDS
during the next five years.

The athlete who may have con-
tracted AIDS by sharing needles
used for injecting anabolic steroids
was not a Pittsburgh case. This was
reported in December I984 from
Mineola, N.Y. I mentioned this case
to emphasize different routes of
transmission of HTLV-III.

Finally, I raised concerns about a
projected increase in AIDS in hete-
rosexuals. There are cases of AIDS

in female prostitutes, primarily
reported from the New York City
area. Many of these are intravenous
drug abusers. In some cases, it

appears that heterosexual male
partners of these prostitutes have
developed AIDS. These represent a
fraction of the total cases of AIDS.
Indeed, it may be that most hetero-
sexuals do not have certain co-
factors that are necessary for
HTLV-III to actually cause AIDS.

Additional research is needed to
determine the risk of acquiring
HTLV-III and developing AIDS in
heterosexual partners of people in
groups at high risk for AIDS. How-
ever, I agree with other investigators
from New York City and the CDC
that there “already is a clear case for
public health prevention and educa-
tion efforts targeted at [these] hete-
rosexual partners.” (Lancet, Dec.
8,1984).

An F In Journalism

It is disappointing to see a paper
that strives so hard to be a news-
paper and exhibits journalistic capa-
bility above the level of mediocrity
fail so many times. Unfortunately,
The Pitt News has received an F in
journalism once again. But this time
it also receives a very low grade in
integrity.

Alison Sterne, a Pitt News report-
er, reported in a recent edition that
all actions of the Affirmative Action
Committee of the Student Govern-
ment Board were suspended by the
SGB. In the article, Ms. Sterne
reports the reasons why the SGB
suspended the actions of the com-
mittee and also presumes to com-
ment about some of the committee's
recent actions. The article is written
as if it is a news story while the tone
of the article is editorial and
accusative.

First, Ms. Sterne discusses the
“problems" with the Affirmative
Action Committee with SGB presi-
dent Luke Kluchko and nowhere in
the article does she mention that she
talked with the committee chairman
Jackie Jackson. If her article was
meant to be an investigative piece,
Ms. Sterne’s investigating is akin to
that of The National Enquirer, and
if her article is not an investigative
piece, then it is a poorly written news
story.

To be sure, the article was sup-
posed to be a news report on the
SGB meeting, yet Ms. Sterne mis-
takenly conflates the job of a news
reporter with the job an investigative
reporter does and, further still,
makes the biggest mistake of report-
ing both of these in the same article.

But I am most troubled with why
Ms. Sterne has chosen to give the

impression that the Affirmative
Action Committee is most mistaken
in its operations. Ms. Sterne reports
that “Jackson supposedly confirmed
plans for the fair ...” The use of “sup-
posedly” entails that there is reason
to doubt Ms. Jackson’s actions as
having occurred.

Who does Ms. Sterne think she is,
accusing Ms. Jackson of lying with-
out real provocation for doing so?
Did she call Jackie Jackson and ask
her about the recruitment fair? No!
Did she call William Nunn and ask
him about the recruitment fair? No!
Did she even ask anyone on the com-
mittee if they had bylaws? No! Did
she ask the other three board
members why they voted against the
suspension? No!

I should say that Ms. Sterne has
acted in the most embarrassing
manner to The Pitt News.

As for the SGB, it is obvious that
they have grown tired of their two-
month-old Affirmative Action
Committee. The suspension was
without prior knowledge of the com-
mittee and without warrant by the
board. Luke Kluchko is well aware
that the committee has, and has had
for some time now, bylaws. ,He
should also be well aware‘ of the
committee’s purpose. After all, the
committee was just established two
months ago by the SGB and they
sure as hell had a purpose when they
established it.

Finally, on the problems that “the
board is having with the commit-
tee,” I suppose some would say it is a
matter of perspectives, but it sure
seems like it’s the committee which
has been having problems with the
board.

First of all, the board refused to
give the committee any funds to
recruit members. Perhaps they just
wanted an Affirmative Action Com-
mittee in name only. Secondly, the
board only wanted the committee to
“discuss” affirmative action issues
and do nothing more. Thirdly, the
board wanted the committee to
“prove” how it could benefit the

board. If it could not, then it was not
needed, argued Kluchko. Fourthly,
the board decided that the commit-
tee was no longer a standing com-
mittee of the SGB and therefore its
chairman should not receive a
salary. Fifthly, the board decided
that the committee should have
more than just “women and blacks"
on it. Sixthly, the board decided that
handicapped students should popu-
late the committee instead of black
students and female students. Sev-
enthly, the board felt that birth con-
trol was a problem among minority
students and that the committee
should see what they can do about
that.

I tell you no lie. These are just
some of the “problems" that the
committee has had with the board.
Unless The Pitt News wishes to be
perceived as a part of this mentality
that has overcome most of the SGB
members, I submit to them that they

IA

I should research before reporting the

“news.” The University of Pitts-
burgh should indeed have a student-
run newspaper that exhibits
journalistic standards above the
level of mediocrity.

And More Hi-Tech

This letter is in response to Wil-
liam Taylor’s letter to the editor
(“More Hi-Tech,” Feb. 22). As a
native Pittsburgher and Pitt student
myself, I am ashamed and angry that
Mr. Taylor would use Pittsburgh's
name in connection with such inane
and isolationist ideas. I think that
Mr. Taylor would do well to take a
class in each of the schools or
departments that he criticizes. Per-
haps this would give him the chance
to learn something, if not gain an
appreciation of the rest of the uni-
versity, instead of locking himself up
"with a computer.

A class in communications (pref-
erably intercultural) might open Mr.
Taylor’s eyes to the world around
him. Maybe he’d see that there is
never an all-encompassing answer to
one’s problems, although Mr. Tay-
lor sees “a computer center” every-
where he looks. ‘

A class in art, music appreciation
or theater might get Mr. Taylor
away from the terminal long enough
to use what he learns in the com-
munications class in first-hand expe-
rience in human contact.

Whether Mr. Taylor wants to use

a business maxim or not (“If it ain’t ,

producing, cut your losses and run”

 Pitt 1 N¢w.j”w.dne.aa§;tsett§.;;§i‘§§t;tt‘i§g3*'”*  i

—— poor grammar and blatant isola-
tionism in one tiny sentence, tsk,
tsk), it would seem that he needs the
help of the School of Education.

GSPIA's reputation is world
renowned. Students come from all
over the U.S. and the world to study
here. Why get rid of something that
brings Pittsburgh so much prestige?
Perhaps Mr. Taylor should take a
few classes in political science and
economics to get a better grip on
what is going on in the world. The
very countries that American pro-
ducers are hard-pressed to compete
with are some_ of the same ones that
receive(d) U.S. aid (both ﬁnancial
and technological). Some of these
countries have managed to produce,
at lower costs, products of equal or
better quality. Such are the risks of
being among the more advanced
nations. Perhaps this is an oversim-
plification, but no more so than
replacing pertinent departments
with computer centers.

I would like to see Mr. Taylor get
through one Pittsburgh winter with-
out the help of a pharmacist. Pitt’s
School of Pharmacy also enjoys a
good reputation and is one of too
few in Pennsylvania. It would seem
self-defeating to do away with it.

‘ I certainly hope that, if the rest of
his letter was not a joke, Mr. Tay-
lor’s call for a reservation policy in
the William Pitt Union cafeteria
was. Would he also like Perrier put
into the water fountains?

These are a few of my views con-
cerning the proposed Five-year Plan
and Mr. Taylor. I would prefer to
attend Pitt rather than a PIT (Pitts-
burgh Institute of Technology).
Let’s keep Pitt a learning institution
and not make it a strictly money-
making corporation filled with
nothing but computers.

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

She reminds you of that
attractive coed in the Miller High
Life ad.

“Hi, it’s my first semester here
and I don‘t know anybody and
your grandmother told my Aunt
Jean that you’re a nice guy and
that I should look you up ...”

And the rest is history.

The college life becomes an
experience made in heaven —
and hell. Mostly, somewhere in
between.

Seemingly, Lisa Birnbach
(BEERN-bahk) has faced, rather
prettily and innocently, enough
of this manic-depressive lifestyle
to coin a book. Everyone does,
so why not? Birnbach canvassed,
depending on ‘who’s to be
believed, 186-250 colleges to
author (appropriately enough)
Lisa Birnbach’s College Book,
published last year.

Probably because this is a uni-
versity and probably because
Birnbach’s 515-page volume is
“the ultimate guide to what's
happening on campus” and
probably because someone saw
fit to meet her $4,000 lecture fee,
she is engaged to speak here next
Tuesday night.

On what is immaterial. As to
who this 27-year-old is, “mate-
rialistic” fits her like those pearls
gracing her neck. She earlier
became the rage of a displaced
populace when The Official
Preppy Handbook suddenly

' informed us our dress code and

weekend habits had to be
reformed. '

It was a gold find for this dad-
dy’s girl who accurately labeled
and personalized the vacuous
among us. We could then per-
sonify those whose greatest ful-

fillments in life came from
steering BMWs. ,

Unfortunately, her first pub-
lished work gave her a license to
thrust another on the vulnerable
public. Now the College Book,
we're led to believe, must be pur-
chased along with the Barron's
telephone book when choosing
undergraduate schools.

Pegged as a reliable guide to
social environs on individual
campuses, we're informed:

0 of where to buy the finest-
tasting pizza.

0 of the more popular drugs.

0 of how ingrained the Greeks
are.

0 of those schools where pan- .

dered jocks rule.

I know; at last one sounds
iffy. Hones y, though, the whole
book yearns for credibility. This
is not a book review, but let's
consider the source.

Lisa Birnbach. Graduate of
Brown University. Former Vil-
Iage Voice columnist whose life is
an extension of her preppy col-
lege days. Subject of a “Dewar’s
Profile" magazine ad campaign,
occasioning her shunning the

‘ beer crowd. Excellent satirist
whose potential is yet unfulfilled.

That’s about it. If the bio-
graphy appears overly shallow, a
similar "wading-pool effect
strikes College Book. No doubt
Birnbach’s undertaking was
massive, crisscrossing every
state. .

State by state, school by
school, the first and only college
guide to tell it like it is 

I-Iuh-uh. Not when three peo-
ple at each school are inter-
viewed to get a feel for
clothes-conscious students,

introverted engineering people
or the ease with which girls can
be picked up.

Maybe unknowingly, Birn-
bach has parlayed her writing
abilities into a catchy social com-
mentary on today's cornerstones
and grindstones of higher educa-
tion. She also parlays her author-
ing of the book into some .
sheepskin doctorate that sud-
denly bestows upon her the cre-
dentials to evaluate campus
social conditions.

If ever I respected this nation,
the prevalence of capitalism was
one reason. The contempt here is
not for the money she can com-
mand on the famed lecture cir-
cuit. Instead, it is the misleading
of (again) the vulnerable people.

How level can a book be when
SAT means are mixed with “Col-
lege Etiquette Tips” (sex with the
professor, for instance)?

Now, were this book of the Art
Buchwald variety, its value
would exceed the $9.95 list price.

Still, success is the keyword to
Lisa Birnbach — something all
entrants to the college world
seemingly. hope to achieve,
whether inspirationally or
otherwise.

One final word to the coed-
turned-lady with the catchy
smile. .You know that pin that
sits atop the scaled-down version
of the continental U.S.A. on the
book’s cover? The one that yells,
“I Love Penn State”?

Why is it sitting atop the area
of the state usually reserved for
Pittsburgh?

system, or any system of higher edu-
cation, they must be prepared.

“The nation was jarred in 1983 by
the disturbing portrait of our public
schools painted by the National
Commission on Excellence in Edu-
cation,” Thornburgh said. “Since
then, without exception, we have all
taken important steps to improve
quality in our elementary and secon-
dary schools.”

The governor recounted Pennsyl-
vania’s accomplishments, outlined
in his administration’s comprehen-
sive education reform package,
“Turning the Tide: An Agenda for
Excellence in Pennsylvania’s Public
Schools.”

Among the accomplishments
cited by the governor were increased
requirements for high school gradu-
ation, a statewide reading and
mathematics competency testing
program that provides remedial help
for students who need it, toughened
requirements for certification of
teachers, the establishment of an
honors program for high school
seniors and the special summer pro-
grams for outstanding high school
students. .

“Our education agenda is clearly
designed to turn the tide toward
excellence in our schools. As the
recommendations in your ‘Involve-
ment in Learning’ study suggest, it
is, indeed, time to move forward

. with equal commitment to excel-

lence in our and
universities.”

He said that in his I985-86 budget
proposal, introduced two weeks
ago, he used the preliminary recom-
mendations of the blue-ribbon
Commission on Financing Higher
Education to ensure the continua-
tion of Pennsylvania’s system of
higher education.

The higher education initiatives
developed in concert with the com-
mission include an $8 million schol-
arship program for part-time
students who attend community col-
leges and universities, a $1 million
merit scholarship program to
encourage students of exceptional

ability to stay and study in Pennsyl- _

vania, a $1 million initiative to
establish “Chairs of Excellence” at
the state's universities and a $2.5
million deferred-maintenance
matching program for the state uni-
versity system.

Thornburgh noted that “as Penn-
sylvania strives to diversify its econ-
omy, higher education has become a
critical component in our economic
development efforts,” citing the Ben
Franklin Partnership as an example
of how higher education contributes
to economic development.

The Ben Franklin Partnership,
initiated by Thornburgh in I983, is
the largest state technology transfer
program in the country. From an
initial state investment of$l million
in “seed money,” more than $116

Special therapy program helps wife abusers

step  I would be divorced today.”

Ted is one ofthe two million men
involved in spouse abuse each year,
one of the hundreds who actually
seek help. In Allegheny County
alone in 1983, there were over a
thousand reported cases of wife
abuse; authorities say that actual
incidents are much higher.

The abuse often begins with ver-
bal attacks and minor quarrels but
escalates into striking and, finally,
beating. Unrecognized, this situa-
tron can become a fatal one for the
victim or the abuser. Yet only in the
last decade with the establishment of
shelters for battered women and
counseling programs for the abusers
has progress been made in stopping
the violence. '

Pittsburgh’s Second Step pro-
gram is working to stop domestic
violence. It is one of 40 organiza-
tions across the country that coun-
sels men who physically abuse their
wives. Originating in 1979 as the
Task Force for Men and Violence,
Second Step has developed as a pri-
vate, nonprofit organization that
offers individual and group therapy.

“We’re trying to strike a balance
between the self-help model for
groups and a professional format,”
said Jim Hanneken, administrative
director of Second Step. “Our main
purpose is to end the violence
through a combination of support
and correction; to support men who
are making the effort to change.”

Although wife abuse has long

been a problem, with increasing
media attention, public awareness is
growing. For instance, Second Step
usually receives two or three phone
calls a day. According to Hanneken,
within 24 hours after “The Burning
Bed” (a television movie portraying
wife abuse) was broadcast in
November, the organization
received 47 phone calls.

“Things have always been this
bad," said Hanneken, “but we never
knew it. Women are finally coming
out of the closet and forcing men to

get help.”
Although in some cases it is the
threat of imprisonment that

prompts a man into seeking help, for
most men the prompt is the fear of
losing their wives. According to

  7

Hanneken, the majority of Second
Step members enter the program
during a “crisis point,” — when sep-
aration or divorce seems imminent.

This was Ted's situation. He was
40 years old, had two kids, a good

job and was on his second marriage.

The first marriage ended because of
his abusive behavior. Despite mar-
riage counseling, the second was on
the verge of ending for the same rea-
son. Ted’s wife had already left him
twice, and she gave him one ﬁnal
alternative. “Either get help, or I'm
leaving again."

“It took me a long time before I
convinced myself that I couldn‘t
handle my problems alone,” said

“All they get on the streets
is abuse. If they can relieve
a little bit of the hostility
they ﬁnd everywhere else,
then maybe that's the role
I ‘m supposed to play.”

--Carol Wallace

 
come in and cry, saying, ‘I have to
find out how my mother is, l have to
call her.’ And I’d say to him, ‘Every
time you call your mother you yell at
each other. l’m not letting you call
her anymore.’ ”

Not all of the street people are
millionaires, nor do many even have
mothers, but they all have special
problems that are of utmost impor-
tance to them. Wallace said that one
of the high points of her job is the
emotional therapy she provides just
by hearing them out, by acting as a
“Catcher-in-the-Rye" for these peo-
ple she knows only by their faces.

“I know they can at least come to
me to get something off their

chests,” she said. “You become a
scapegoat. You know you’re helping
themjust by taking their abuse. But
that’s all you can do for them."
When she questions whether or not
it is time for her to leave St. Mary of
Mercy and the street people behind,
Wallace reminds herself of the
young man with a serious psycho-
logical problem who came to her
looking for help when she had just
begun working at the church.

The man wanted to commit him-
self to Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic and needed Wallace to go
with him to the initial screening.
They spent several long hours at the
interview, and thanks to Wallace’s
continual emotional support, the
young man was entered into a pro-
gram through which he received the
psychiatric help he needed. He even-

' tually left Western Psych and, with

Wallace’s help, landed a job. The
man is now leading a normal life.
The entire process took three years.

“He gave me the impetus to keep
going,” she said. “It was the first
success. If it happened once, it can
always happen again.”

Wallace commented that she isn’t
seeking sainthood. Right now, she
and her husband are looking for-
ward to parenthood -~ sometime
late next month. Of course, once the
baby is born, it’s back to work at St.
Mary of Mercy and the Red Door
and back to being a psychological
punching bag for the people Wallace
said she knows “just by face, not by
name.

“All they get on the streets is
abuse,” she said. “If they can relieve
a little bit of the hostility they find
everywhere else, then maybe that’s
the role l’m supposed to play.

“l am still helpin  l’m stillhelp-
ing. It's just not a very pleasant way
to help,” Wallace said, leaning for-
ward and laughing a little. “I can’t
list them as my achievements. ldon’t
consider myself a saviour by any
means.”

Police Beat

By Samuel Thompson
The Pitt News

Jeffrey Deckings, 22, of I100 North Wheeler St., faces five counts of simple assault and one count each of
resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, stemming from an incident at the Original Hot Dog Shop in Oakland
Saturday night. According to police, Deckings was asked to leave the hot dog shop by Officer Raymond P.
Kain, 28, of the No.4 police station, for behaving in a loud and disorderly fashion. Deckings left the premises
and began wrestling with an unwilling bystander. Kain separated the pair and informed Deckings that he was
upfder arrest. Deckings then allegedly punched Kain, bloodying his nose; he also fought with four assisting
o icers.

In a related incident, Robert Warner, 25, of Bethesda, Md., and Julia Durishan, also 25, of North Craig
Sht., were cited for public intoxication as they shouted, “police brutality" to a crowd that gathered to watch
t e arrest.

Samuel “Blinker" Lane, 40, of 304 Wood St., was arrested Saturday for the rape of a 38-year-old Oakland
waitress on Friday night. The victim identiﬁed Lane Saturday. The victim said that Lane had offered to walk
her home from Mitchell’s Tavern on Centre Avenue, and on the way had forced her to have intercourse in a
parking lot.

Three burglaries were reported yesterday in the South Oakland area with losses reported over $2,100. The
houses were located on Parkview Avenue, Ward Street and Dawson Street.

Samuel and Daniel Maldonado, aged 35 and 25 respectively, peacefully turned themselves into city police
station No. 4 today on charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, violation of the Uniform Firearms Act and
reckless endangerment.

The victim, who was dressed as a woman, was shot in the hand during the struggle which followed his
refusal to fellate the other two men unless he received the sum of $40.

As the victim ﬂed, he picked up Samuel Maldonado’s wallet from the ﬂoor of the assailants‘ vehicle. The
victim told police that Maldonado pulled a gun when asked for payment, then said, “I will pay,” and
demanded that the victim fellate him.

Anthony Scalise, 43, of 96 Courtland St., was arrested Friday for possession of narcotics. Police,
answering a call from Scalise‘s estranged wife, found a box of “brown vegetable matter and seeds, suspected
to be marijuana.”

Linda Scalise also produced a larger quantity of marijuana and a plastic bag containing a white substance,
syringes, Nositol, a substance used to “cut" cocaine, and a balance scale.

\ Ralph Pence, 41, of Blackhawk Road, was arrested Thursday when police responded to several com-
plaints of harrassment in the second ﬂoor men's room of the Cathedral of Learning.
The investigating officer sat in a stall next to the suspect and was soon greeted by his smiling face peering
under the partition. Claimed Pence, “I had every right to be there."

The Foodland market at 828 Hazelwood Ave. was robbed Saturday night of IS ﬂags from various nations
which had stood on the roof of the building.

Richard Tracey, the manager who reported the theft, said that the ﬂags had been previously stolen and the
store replaced them but he could not estimate the cost. He did not know whether the ﬂags would be replaced
again.

problem and my responsibility to
solve. I kept telling myself that men
were supposed to be strong enough
to handle their own problems and
not show their weaknesses.”

This inability to express emotions
is a common trait of batterers.
Although the problem of wife abuse
is not prominent in any particular
social, racial or economic group,
according to Second Step’s coordi-
nating director David Russel, there
are certain common personality
traits, including low self-esteem, a
“Jekyll-and-Hyde” personality and
a need to control relationships.

“Dealing with emotions was my
biggest problem,” said Ted. “I used
to keep everything inside, and I
didn't know how to release the ten-
sion. I still have that ‘Jekyll-and-
Hyde’ personality, but now I can
recognize the cause of my tension
and react sensibly.”

The causes of abusive behavior
have little to do with the faults of a
particular relationship. Studies
show that a majority of batterers
may have been abused or neglected
as children. ,According to Han-
neken, about 40 percent of Second
Step’s clients came from families
with abusive fathers.

“I was abused as a child,” said
Ted. “And my father also abused my
mother. I saw things that I swore I

Friday, March 1, was to have been
the night of a concert and dance to
benefit Eye and Ear Hospital. De-
spite extensive planning by the Pitt
_fraternity Lambda Chi Alpha, the
show will probably not go on.

According to Bill Boring, vice
president of the fraternity and chair-
man of the concert, the concert has

would never do and have done.”

Spouse abuse cannot be evaluated
without a sharp examination of sex
roles and social attitudes which
imply that men have the right to
dominate their wives. “Abuse is a
belief. It’s not a disease,” said Rus-
sell. “It's a historical process that
must be undone."

One of these social attitudes is
what researchers call “the play-
ground ethic,” which encourages
male children to hide their feelings
and fight for‘ what they want and
which also places an emphasis on the
“macho” male image.

“One of the things we are taught
as men is to be strong and in con-
trol,” said Hanneken. “The violence
is an extension of this control. In
many cases, violence is an accepted
way to solve problems.”

Although much progress with the
subject of spouse abuse has been
made in the last decade, society has
only begun to recognize and attempt
to ameliorate the problem. Han-
neken and Russell, like many who
counsel men involved in spouse
abuse, agree that the problem can-
not be eradicated without a sharp
examination of sex roles and social
attitudes that imply women are
inferior.

“Until men learn that women are
not second-class citizens,” said Rus-
sell, “and that abuse doesn’t solve

problems  there will be abused
women."
Ted has experience these

“machismo” social pressures. “Com-
ing to terms with my emotions was
my biggest problem,” said Ted. “My
inability to express my emotions led
to stress, and violence was an easy
way to react to stress. I knew that
what went on in the home was safe
unless my wife called the police, nine
chances out of 10 a neighbor won’t."

Another social factor contribut-
ing to wife abuse is an ideal of per-
fection that men are expected to
achieve. Last year, St. John’s Uni-
versity in New York conducted a
study on 34 men involved in spouse
abuse and determined they all
resorted to abusive behavior as a
reaction to a self—perceived failure to
attain perfection.

“I still have trouble putting too
much pressure on myself and striv-
ing for perfection too much,” said
Ted. “But it is getting a little easier
each week, and since I’ve been
involved in this program, I’ve
learned to come to terms with my
emotions much better.”

The Second Step program
involves a treatment for batterers
who use one-to-one and group ses-
sions to encourage the men to
assume responsibility for their
actions, to stop blaming their vic-
tims for» provoking the abuse and

eventually to come to grips with
their underlying feelings of insecur-
ity and inadequacy. The sessions
meet weekly, and each man attends
for a minimum of 16 weeks, a period
in which, according to Hanneken,
“we can only begin to scratch the
surface."

The process can take months or
years, but over half of Second Step’s
clients achieve nonviolent, produc-
tive lives. Ted has been involved in
the program for two years.

“Before Second Step, I didn't feel
that I could talk to a guy as a friend.
I didn't feel I could talk to a man
about anything but football,” said
Ted. “But now that all has changed.
I can talk to them about my prob-

wife abusers

lems, and I know they understand.
We’re all in the same boat. No one
condones it. We all know it’s wrong
and we want to make it right. The
group sessions are a way of con-
structively releasing anger and
tension.”

Ted also feels that battering is
accepted by society. “The fact that
people shove it under the carpet has
continued to allow men not to seek
help. It’s going to take a long time
for people to accept battering as a
problem and for the men to stop
trying to live up to that macho, emo-
tionless image. It took me a long
time to realize and admit my prob-
lem  but I did  and my life has
bettered because of it.”

been canceled because the Office of
Student Activities could not provide
them with the needed staff to oversee
the event.

Planning for the fundraiser began
back in December, Boring said. In
January, he said, the Office of Stu-
dent Activities approved the plans
and told Boring they did not foresee
any difficulties. But on Feb. 14, Bor-
ing said, he received a call telling him
the concert was off.

Boring said the security and the
electrician, hired for the occasion at

$150 each, are plenty of supervision.
He added that Rick Foget ofthe Pitt
Program Council would “stop in”
between the showing of a movie and
the concert. The activities office did
not think that was enough, though,
Boring said; they wanted someone
to be there the entire time.

Bridget Guernsey, an advisor
from the Office of Student Activi-
ties, said that security was not
enough to chaperone the concert.

she said, “someone from the staff

Preview Pitt hosts Big East splash

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

" The Lady Panther swimming and

‘ diving team move into the second

phase of their season this Thursday
as they host the Big East Swimming
and Diving Championship Meet at
Trees Pool.

The team accomplished the initial
step of their collective goals for the
season by going undefeated (9-0) for
the first time since 1976. The team
now hopes to successfully complete
the next step by claiming their third
consecutive Big East Championship

‘ title. '

‘ According to head coach David

‘ Belowich, the team is not expecting
much of a threat in the team compe-
tition, but there will be some tough
individual races.

Belowich feels that Pitt will be
battling it out with Boston College,
Villanova and Syracuse for the top
four spots.

“I’m expecting faster swimming
across the board this year, compared
to last year’s meet,” Belowich said.
“The number of entries will be about

4% the same, but the qualifying times
‘ ‘ will be faster. ’

’ “We’re confident that we will win.
We're not cocky, but I think that we
should be first or at worst second in
most events. We're ready to swim
fast,” Belowich said.

Besides winning the meet, Belo-
wich said that his goal is to have
everyone make their best times in
their events. “I'm not looking for

 any stars,” he said. “To me, it’s not a
matter of who swims fast. I'd like to
see everyone make their personal
best times. If that happens, all else
will follow."

Expected favorites for the Lady
Panthers are Sue Heon, a senior
from Clark Summit, Pa., who is
back with the team after taking a
year off to compete in the Summer
Olympics. She will be competing in
the 500- and 1,650-yard freestyle, the

North Hills produces Pitt wrestlers

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

A trend is being set: more and
more wrestlers from Pittsburgh’s
North Hills are going along with the
crowd and coming to Pitt.

“Pitt has a good name in the
North Hills,” said Panther coach
Rande Stottlemyer. “We’re well
respected. We want to keep the local
kids at home and Pitt is a good
school for athletics and academics.
It is good to have these athletes here
and I hope it continues.”

Among those setting the trend

from Shaler Area High School are
Gary Bolin, Scott Hartman, Kyle

Wrestlers finish regular season

Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

After losing to Clarion 34-12
Thursday evening, the Pitt wrestlers
came back to finish their dual meet
season brilliantly with two victories
on Saturday.

In the first of Saturday’s matches,
the Panthers defeated Franklin and
Marshall 27-15. Pitt then travelled
to Millersville where the Marauders
gave them a tough battle, taking the
match down to the final bout.

Panther Ken Hackman, who nor-
mally wrestles at 177 lbs. but who
has been out due to an injury,
returned to the lineup to ﬁll the hea-
vyweight gap that has forced the
Panthers to give up many points
through forfeits. Hackman per-
formed superbly as he took on Mil-
lersville’s heavyweight, who weighed
in at 250 lbs., and defeated him with
a technical fall by compiling a score

of 16-0. The Panthers won the match
by a score of 26-20.

Thursday evening's match against
Clarion might have been called a
“fan’s delight," with many action-
packed individual bouts. “Regard-
less of who you rooted for, you got
your fair share of excitement,”
explained head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “There were outstanding
matches at 126, 134 and 150 lbs., as
well as strong battles at 1 18, 142 and
167 lbs. So, as you can see, the entire
evening kept the fans on the edge of
their seats.

“As for the weekend, we’re
extremely pleased with the guys’ per-
formance,” added Stottlemyer.
“They did a real nice job. We had set
our goal to finish 9-6, and we
reached 8-7. They put forth their
best effort under the circumstances,
and for that we’re pleased.”

Double winners over the weekend
included John Hnath at 126 lbs.,
Kyle Nellis at 134 lbs., Gary Bolin at
150 lbs. and Doug Haines at 158 lbs.

The Panthers also recorded two vic-
tories at 142 lbs. Rich Esswein was
victorious against F&M, while
against Millersville, Greg Zimmer-
man took the win.

The Panthers have finished 8-7,
only the second time in six years that
the Pitt wrestlers finished with a
winning record. And now that their
dual meet season is over, the
wrestlers are preparing for the East-
ern Wrestling League Champion-
ships, where they hope to earn bids
to national championships.

Going into the weekend’s tourna-
ment, Hnath, Nellis and Bolin have
fine shots at taking individual titles.
Haines and Hackman also are capa-
ble of good things.

“The most important thing to
remember is that we don’t mail in the
results beforehand; that’s why we go
to the tournament,” stated Stottle-
myer. “Although the others have
lost a few, and they may not be
ranked high on paper, anything is
possible.” .

tion. He is well respected by his
teammates. He works hard, and I
rejoice in his success. He is also a
prankster and adds fun to the team. I
think he can be an NCAA qualifier
and do well."

Bolin, who has set his goal at mak-
ing it to nationals, has worked hard
to get where he is now. “I am defi-
nitely working harder,” Bolin said.
“My confidence is a lot better this
year and that has helped me individ-
ually. I want to get better.”

Kyle Nellis, another junior, is also
off to a great start. His record stands
at 17-3, but Nellis plans to do better.
‘‘I’m doing pretty well, but there is
always room for improvement,”
Nellis said. “I am happy with how
the season is going."

Nellis comes from a strong wres-

tling family, and that can put pres-

sure on him. “A lot is expected of
Kyle," Stottlemyer said. “Some-
times too much is expected. He has
done a really good job. He is a con-
tender to go to the NCAAs and to
win the conference.”

The two other wrestlers from
Shaler have been hampered by injur-
ies. Freshman Scott Hartman will
not compete at all this season
because of a shoulder injury that has
required surgery three times. Sopho-
more Greg Zimmerman, who has a
2-4 record, has been bothered with
knee problems.

“Injuries have been Greg’s stum-
bling block,” Stottlemyer said. “He
has not been able to complete a sea-
son yet. His best years are ahead of
him.” V .

North Allegheny also has a strong
wrestling program under Coach Gus
DeAugustino, and they have sent
some talented performers to Pitt.
Joe Bond, a junior, is a good exam-
ple of that. Bond has compiled an
8-6 record this season and plans to
continue his winning ways.

Bond said. “Step by step, I am trying
to achieve that. I am keeping a posi-
tive attitude about it. My wrestling
technique and style are much better
this year than my freshman and
sophomore years, and that helps.”

Bond, a co-captain, placed fourth
in the Eastern Wrestling League
Championships last year.

“Joe is doing a good job,” Stot-
tlem‘yer said. “A lot is expected of
him. The potential is there for him to
have an outstanding year.”

Greg Dille, a sophomore, has not
had a lot of opportunities to wrestle,
but when he does, he should have no
trouble improving on his 0-1 record.
“Greg does anything that is asked of
him,” Stottlemyer said. “He gives
200 percent all of the time. He is a
team player.”

North Hills High School has also
made contributions to the Pitt team.
Freshman Mike Tongel has been an
early contributor for the Panthers
and has a record of 8-9. “Mike is
young and needs more experience,”
Stottlemyer said. “He has the poten-
tial to be a really good one. More
experience on the mat will give him
more confidence. He is very coacha-
ble. He does what you tell him to
do." ,

Rich Esswein, a senior, has not
wrestled this season, but the walk-on
has been working hard.

“Rich is a real good kid,” Stot-
tlemyer said. “He has developed
since he has been here. He has had a
tough time this year because his class
schedule conflicts a lot with wres-
tling. This should have been his best
year. He still works hard, though,
and there is no lack of effort."

In addition to being good
wrestlers, all of these athletes excel
in the classroom. “We really stress
the student / athlete role,” Stottlemy-
er said. “The most important thing is
to get your education.”

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The following is an excerpt from
“High and Outside,” a novel by Lin-
nea A. Due. The scene is a high
school party, where Frank is talking _
to some friends, and Niki, the narra-
tor, is listening:

“Arizona State and Penn State
ojfered me full scholarships. And
the Giants‘ scouting crew came to
watch me pitch last game. They set
up an appointment with me and my
father last week. And the Cubs have
sent me a coupla feelers. I ’m waiting
to hear  "

I couldn't stand anymore. I went
to the cupboard, drained the last of
my beer and extracted another can
from the bag. I sat down at the kitch-
en table. It ticked me off that the
boys got all the action in high
5 ‘tool, in college, in the pros. A full
scholarship! That must be worth 10
thou easy. And from what I heard,
they got all kinds of bonuses, like a
50 here and therefrom loyal alums.
Frank didn’t even have to go to col-
lege. He could sign on for some fat
amount with a ball club andplay on
the farm team awhile. Where would
I be? A lousy coed at some lousy
college dreaming about my big high
school pitching career. Boy, was I
important then 

“Niki?"

“Hi, Frank.”

“ "‘Look, " he said, "I saw you walk
away, and I realized what a dumb
stunt I was pulling, saying all that
crap, when you ‘re as good a pitcher
as I am  ”

He was ﬂoundering badly, and I
finally took pity on him. “I know it's
not your fault. It makes me feel
lousy, though. It’s so unfair.”

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 27, 1985

Catching mass conformity on rebound

This novel’s primary focus is the
all-too-common social problem of
teen alcoholism, a disease to which
Niki is slowly but surely falling vic-
tim. But this passage also draws out
the existence of a social disease of a
different color, one not immediately
recognizable as harmful but one that

can still do some damage. Here are .

two people who like to do the same
thing —— something they do fairly
well. Presumably, neither wants to
stop doing it, but one of them will
upon graduation, or more accu-
rately, when the season ends.

Everyone knows that girls are not
as strong, as experienced or as inter-
ested in sports as boys, and that
there are simply relatively few pro-
fessional sports available to women
—— or to girls harboring dreams of
athletic stardom. Does the average
college student stop to consider why
this is so? .

Probably not. As Niki stated, “It’s
so unfair.” Few things in life are, and
it would be hopelessly idealistic to
imagine that someday everyone will
be happy doing what he pleases and
everything will be fair and equitable.
But while we’re on the subject, who
is really being given the raw deal, the
short end of the stick? Is it just Niki
who is victimized by the strict social-
ization process through which we
put our children?

Frank, who may or may not make

it through college let alone the pros
(everyone knows that about one in
500,000 little leaguers makes it in the
pros, right?), may not like what he’s
doing. In this story, he apparently
does. However, not every boy longs
for sports superstardom, for the pot
of gold at the end of the court, field
or pool. Not every boy likes to ﬂex
bulging muscles at giggling cheer-
leaders. And not every boy wants to
marry the girl next door and bring
home the bacon for a big (or small),
happy family. .

No, this is not a book review.

Nor do I have anything against
families. No one deserves more
respect and admiration than those
people who choose to take on the
responsibilities of raising a family,
which consumes much time and
physical and emotional energy, not
to mention the unmentionable,
money. My hat is off, except that I
don’t wear one  oh, well.

   

The key word here is choice. We
live in America the brave, the beauti-
ful, the land of the free to do as
everyone else does. Let’s get what
the Joneses have, only one step bet-
ter. Let’s get what Cheryl has, only
one thread better. Let’s do what we
want to do — as long as it is socially
acceptable.

Social acceptance. Everyone
wants it, craves it. It is a basic human
need, that desire to fit right in and be
embraced by one’s peers. The popu-
lar assumption is that one needs to
be a clone to be liked by peers. The
conformity precludes the
acceptance.

What, you may well ask, have
social pressures to do with sports?

I ask in response: What have
sports ‘to do with masculinity?

To be athletic is to be a man. So
often I have heard people say, “She
plays like a man.” This is a compli-

ment —— she is skillful, she is hard- '

nosed, she is strong. She is also
something out of the ordinary. ,

There is nothing perma'nent
except change, however. Attitudes
change with changing times; laws
are passed, and those who perceive
themselves as oppressed make
waves. People take it upon them-
selves, courageously, to follow their
hearts instead of their neighbor. The
change in athletics, wrought by the
hard-fought passage and enforce-

ment of Title IX of the Education’
Amendments of 1972, can be readily
seen in the 100 percent increase in
the number of college women varsity
athletes and in the 500 percent
increase in the number of high
school girls on athletic teams.
Females now represent one third of
all college and high school athletes
and one half of the intramural par-
ticipants. This could not have been
accomplished without money, how-
ever. The average percentage of the
total athletic budget allotted to
women’s sports was two percent in
1974 and rose to 16 to 24 percent
(depending on the size of the school)
by 1982.

Given the chance, people will do
what society deems improper. Cho-
ice, as I see it, should be relatively
free of social restrictions, those con-
straints people put on themselves. I
am proposing that individuals
reconsider the difference between
that which is fair and that which is
simply accepted as the way it is, the
way it has been and the way it was
meant to be.

Olympic-style workout
leads to swimmer’s success‘

By Tom Horew
For The Pitt News

Just as a hot knife slices through
butter, so does Sue Heon slice
through the waters of NCAA pools
across the country.

Heon, of Clarks Summit, Pa., is a
member of the 1984 Olympic swim
team, a three-time All-America and
a senior at the University of Pitts-
burgh. She is once again lengths
ahead of her competition.

Heon is a strong candidate to
repeat her All-America perfor-
mance. This would put her in such
elite company as other four-time
Pitt All-Americas Kathy Stetler and
Amy Jackson (swimming) and Tony
Dorsett and Hugh Green (football).

“This is the best team I’ve been on,
personnel-wise,” Heon said. “I enjoy
my teammates. They are a great
bunch of girls to be around. We all
want another Big East Champion-
ship.”

The vivacious Heon has had a
considerable impact on Lady

tﬂncegin or lifetime... I

tests fofevec

 

Panther Swimming. Her impact is
evident in the numerous school
records she holds: the 500-, 1,000-
and 1,650-yard freestyle, the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke, as a
member of the 400-yard medley
relay team, and in her specialty, the
400-yard individual medley. The
400-meter IM is the event in which
she has attained the No.4 ranking in
the United States and in the world.

That she has made such a splash
on the swimming world is no acci-
dent. It has been done through hard
work and dedication; she trains an
average of five hours a day. This
consists of required practice in the
morning and the afternoon with the
team and a practice session in the
evening of her own. Although this is
often monotonous, Heon would not
have it any other way.

“I am a very fitness— and health-
minded person," she said. “I train
because I want to.”

When things get tough, Heon

really gets going. Pitt coach Dave
Belowich is always providing her
with a challenge in the water. Her
teammates and her opponents
always supply a challenge by want-
ing to knock off the high-touted
swimmer.

“At times I may be a little sluggish
in the water,” she said. “That’s when
my pride takes over. I am a very.\
proud person and I don’t like to
lose.”

She comes from a supportive fam-
ily and is family-oriented. Her par-
ents, Arthur and Judy, are always
there for her.

“I remember when I was training
for the Olympics,” recalls Heon, “I
called home and said ‘I just can’t
take it anymore. I want to quit.’
They said, ‘It’s up to you, honey.
Whatever you do, we are behind you
I00 percent.’ That was important to
me. Whateverdecision I made, they '2‘
supported me.”

Heon has a brother who is a
sophomore at Penn State. Natu-
rally, a rivalry exists.“This year I am
two up on Garry,” she said. “We
won in football and in swimming
and I don’t let him forget it.”

Heon is not quite sure what her
future holds. A communications
major, she would like to get ajob in
sales marketing or public relations.
She has not ruled out swimming,
though. '

“I will still be in the water every
day, but I won’t compete,” she said.
“I don’t want to lose the feel for the
water, in case I do compete again.”

meet which took place last Saturday
night.

This Saturday night, they will be
at Ohio State University, which is
the only team in the region to con-
sistently score over I80 points this
season. While Pitt has not broken
I80 yet this season, they did so last
year in the NCAA Northeast
Regional Championships with a
school record score of 181.9. There
are only, three returning members
from last year’s squad, but the seven
freshmen added to those from last
year should have a legitimate chance
at making the nationals.

is the Big East record holder in the

tender to win it.

Other top contenders represent-
ing Pitt will be Judy Haughton in the
100 and 200 butterﬂy, freshman
Marian Cassidy in the 200-yard
freestyle and Tricia Ney in the one-
and three-meter diving competition.

The squad will have the home
pool advantage for the champion-
ship for the third year in a row. “Eve-
ryone knows how fast the pool is,”
Belowich said. “Other teams have
been here two times before. We are
able to have an edge where mental
preparation is concerned. Our
swimmers have a good image of the
place. We have a stronger and
clearer picture of success.”

“The level of intensity is really
something to watch,” said Linda
Bruno, the Big East director of
championships. “The coaches call
Trees one of the best pools, and par-
ticipants get a wonderful opportun-
ity to work out in one of the highest
quality facilities around."

According to Belowich, the team
began preparations for the meet four
weeks ago, when they started to
reduce the amount of yards they
swim during practice in the first

b phase of the team’s tapering process.

“The purpose of tapering,”
according to Belowich, “is to get the

swimmers in a state of chronic
fatigue. They are to continue to
work harder and harder while they
are tired in order for the muscles to
respond to the fatigue. After the
swimmer recovers from the chronic
fatigue _ by cutting down the
amount of yards swam in practice
and gradual reductions in both the
Nautilus and speed circuit workouts
and the elimination of morning
workouts, several weeks before you
want to peak — they should be ready
both psychologically and physiolog-
ically to have tremendous perfor-
mances.”

Another way the swimmers get
physiologically and psychologically
ready for their best performance is
to shave. According to Belowich, the
women refrain from shaving their
arms and legs during the season,
until they are ready to have their
peak performances.

“Shaving streamlines the body so
there is less drag,” said Belowich.
“Shaving also takes off a layer of
dead skin so that nerve endings are
closer to the skin surface. That
makes the swimmers more sensitive
when they enter the water. The sen-
sation creates a feeling that you can’t
feel your legs, so you can kick as
hard as you want and you don’t feel

tired.”

third Big East championship

Chaz Pal a/ The Pitt News

 By Teresa Varley
' For The Pitt News

It is not often that a coach finds
himself in a situation where he has
two members of the same family
doing an outstanding job for his
team. -

Fred Lewis, the coach of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh m‘en"s swim
team, has the Emore brothers, Geoff
and Jim, doing an outstanding job
for the Panthers.

The Emores, who are from
Churchville, Pa., will both be top
contenders when Pitt hosts the Big
East Swimming and Diving Cham-
pionships Feb. 28-March 2 at Trees
Pool.

Geoff, a fifth-year senior major-
ing in economics, has plenty of expe-
rience where the Big East is
concerned, and he knows what to
expect going into it.

ON THE
FRONT
LINE...

Dr. Margaret Hostetter
Pediatrician
University oi Minnesota

A March of Dimes research
grantee, Dr. Hostetter wants
to know how the human
body defends itself against
common bacteria

She will use this knowledge
to stimulate a baby's own
immune system to fight off
infection—a|l part of the
March of Dimes on-going
fight against birth defects.

“I am really looking forward to
it,” he said. “I am confident that the
team will come away with a victory.
Ijust hope I can swim fast. I have a
positive attitude, and I am confident
going into it.” The quieter of the
two, Geoff has come a long way
since he came to Pitt.

“Geoff has really developed
through the years," Lewis said. “He
has worked harder this year than in
the past. My major concern is that
he gets enough rest. He has to do less
in the water. He is a good team
leader and swimmer." V I

Geoff swam his best times this
year in a recent meet against a tough
West Virginia team. He recorded a
1:57 in the 200-yard individual med-
ley and a 1:58 in the 200-yard
backstroke.

“He did his best against our
toughest competition,” Lewis said.
“That is a good indication of what
kind of individual he is.”

not too sure of what to expect from
the Big East.

“We are expected to win,” he said.
“I'll find out when we get there. I
think I have a good chance of win-
ning, and if not that, come in
second."

A big part of Jim’s decision to
come to Pitt was having his older
brother around.

“I saw what the program did for
him,” Jim said. “He really enjoyed it.
Also, I knew Fred and some of the
guys on the team, so I was not start-
ing out strange. It has helped a lot
having him here.” ‘

“For someone who never com-
peted at a national level, he has
really developed a fighting attitude,”
Lewis said. “He gives 100 percent.
He is doing in individual meets what
I hoped he'd do at the end of the
year. He is a bright spot for the
team."

ratio is very good, has the attitude

needed for intense competition.
Although there‘s some competition
between the two brothers to see who
can do better, it's more of a help than
a hindrance.

“They both want to do well,"
Lewis said. “Both of them cheer for
each other. They have as much con--
cern for the other’s performance as
they do for their own."

' Since Geoff was redshirted last
year, this is the first year the two
have competed on the same team.

They will be going head-to-head in
the Big East meet in the 100 butterﬂy
and the I00 backstroke. It should be
quite a race.

“I think an Emore will definitely
win the 100 butterfly and back-
stroke,” Lewis said. -

But which Emore will come out
on top? The only way to find out is to
come and watch the two of them
fight it out at the Big East swim
meet. Tickets are available by calling
the Pitt ticket office at 624-4601.

Pitt strength coach

By Tom I-lorew
For The Pitt News

It calls a corner of Fitzgerald
Field House home: toward the back
and down a ﬂight of stairs, the door
on the left. What is contained in this
room, when used properly and
under the right guidance, can trans-
form an athlete's body into some-
thing special. The place is the ﬁeld

house weight room, and it’s under‘

the direction of Dr. Warren Sipp.
During the day, Sipp, a native of
Akron, Ohio, and now residing in
Forest Hills, is a mild-mannered
University of Pittsburgh professor.
After classes are through, he dons
his gray sweats and becomes
“strength coach Sipp.” conditioning
and fitness coach for the various Pitt
sports teams, save for football. His
duties vary from basketball to
cheerleading—l6 squads in all.
The weight room opens each day
at l p.m. and closes at 6:30 p.m.

During these hours, numerous ath-

letes pass through the doors. At any
one time you may find swimming,
gymnastics, tennis, volleyball and
baseball players in there. Each team
has its set time in the room, but
Coach Sipp is ﬂexible on that issue.
He sees no harm in track members
lifting with wrestlers or cheerleaders
pumping iron with baseball players.

“I try to establish rapport with the

athletes,” stated Sipp. “Training can
be monotonous, so I try to provide
diversity. You never know what to
expect from me next. I want to keep
the athletes motivated and on their
toes, so I may do some off-the-wall
things.”

He may act like a hard-nosed drill
sergeant at times, but that is just his
way of communicating. When it
comes to conditioning, he knows his
stuff. This is due to his classroom
knowledge, as well as his being an
athlete himself. When you combine
these two, the result is a superior
coach.

Sipp attended. the University of
Michigan on a full football scholar-
ship. He played for four years there,
at three different positions: offensive
tackle, tight end and fullback.
Although his football playing days
are long gone, Sipp still stays active
by playing recquetball, camping,
hiking and fishing. “I played'foot-
ball in ‘college, but baseball was my
favorite sport,” he said.

Sipp does not work a 9-to-5 job.
“You live this job,” said Sipp, who is
a member of the National Strength
and Conditioning Coaches Associa-
tion. “My day consists of a variety of
activities. I have teaching, classroom
work, attending athletic events and
the weight room to look after.”

This is a pretty hectic schedule;
however, Sipp is not alone. He has a
gradute assistant, Don Freedline,
who also spends a good bit of time in
the weight room. When Sipp is not

ZELDA’S  

MADNESS

  guides 16 varsityteams

there, Freedline is. Freedline is a
graduate of Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, and is now attending
Pitt.

Both men work, well together.
They are always there if you need
that spot for an extra repetition or
just advice. They keep the weight
room free of clutter, except for the
inspirational messages that are
posted all over the place. This is
especially true when an athlete
leaves a sweatshirt lying around.
Sipp makes a public display of such
a deviant act. He tells the offender
that he should know better and to
hang up his clothes properly. “I
remember when I took off my sweat-
shirt one time and laid it over a
bench, it was like I committed the
crime of the century,” stated Mark
Nemeth, a Panther baseball player.

The weight room is Sipp’s sanctu-
ary. “I take great pride in this weight
room and want it to be the best on
campus,” stated Sipp. “The success
of the weight room depends on the
athletes’ success. When they do well,
I get a real sense of enjoyment and
accomplishment. You could have all
the equipment in the world, but
unless you win, forget it.”

Acquiring the equipment in the
world may just be Sipp’s goal. “The
more equipment in here, the happier
I am,” he said. “I want this to be the
best weight room. The administra-
tion has shown they care about
athletics, and so do 1. We’re all on
the same team here at Pitt.”
