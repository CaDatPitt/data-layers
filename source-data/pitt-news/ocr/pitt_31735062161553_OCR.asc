Political Cauldron

By HERBERT RACKOFF

\Vhe11 we left off l\Ionda.y, We
had just posed an enigma to
the Independents. It read like
this:

Beyond all doubt, the Inde-
pendents cannot elect more than
three members to the SFA execu-
tive committee,  one of these
must be a woman.

Al Kairys insists that he be on
the committee. Bernie l\’icKenna
wants to be president, and must
be an exec committee member in
order to attain this dream. And
the Dents positively insist that
they be represented.

A knotty problem, indeed, but
not beyond solution. Bill Stark,
pleaded with me Monday to let:
him know the answer in advance,
and since he was so perturbed, I
let him in on the secret. Here it is:

Put a. woman Dent on the com-
mittee! And if you, Ernie, cannot
find a woman to ﬁt the description,
you’re less of a political organizer
than you’ve made it appear thus
far. Would you like to make a
bet, you Dents?

His Name Is Cerrety

Let’s correct a couple of mis-
statements, now, and get down to
the work at hand. First, Monday’s
column recounted how easy it was
for President Rose to push through
his Dent candidate for the chair-
man ‘of senior announcements.

I couldn’t remember the boy’s
name, but Len Levison, our sports
editor, assured me that he was a
pole—vau1ter, and that his name
was—let’s see, now—-Clifton.
George Clifton, that was it!

Anyway, Bob Gerrety was a
pole-vaulter last year and the year
before, and now, since he’s ﬁnished
all his gold points and extractions
and such, he’s in charge of selling i
senior announcements. That part’
about the “tidy commission” is
true, he assured me, but I was
wrong about the headache. “It’s
the easiest job I’ve ever had,”
Gerrety told me.

My other mistake, and it was a
glaring one, had to do with the
ZTA’s and their aﬁiliations. I had
them lined up with the Independ-
ents and running on the Dent
slate. lone Williams, ZTA prexy,

MAY PASS 2,000

The Tuberculin tests, method
for ascertaining need for an X-ray
ﬁlm to determine whether active
Tuberculosis is present, is a cam-
paign sponsored with the cooper-
ation of the student health serv-
ices and The Pitt News.

It has been the aim of this cam-
paign to surpass the 2,000 mark
made in the Wassermann examin-
ations taken last semester because
it is felt by medical men that the
Tuberculin tests are much more
important to a University student
body than the Wassermann’s be-

admitted Monday that she and her
cohorts were up something of a
tree. “We’ve run and succeeded
with the Independents for the last
two years,” she said, “and it would
be a shame if we had to break
away.”

Election Procedure

Now, that’s a tough one to ﬁgure
out. I couldn’t quite understand
why the ZTA’s should want to
break their long-standing connec-
tions.

Having corrected errors and in-
sinuated insinuations, we ought to
have a look at the new election
procedure and attempt to ﬁgure
out what the changes will mean._
Up until this year, the executive‘
committee has had the power to
elect the SFA president from its
members.

The executive committee in-
cludes three members of the ad-
ministration, and six students.
Student exec committee members
are elected from SFA by means of
the limited vote, each member be-
ing permitted to vote for three.

With this set—up, it takes a huge
majority, more than two to one, to
get better than a three-out—of-six
split on the committee.

If you can count, and you don’t
have to be a math major, you can
see that the “Faculty” part of the '
Student Faculty Assembly has the
balance of power. That is, it HAD
the balance of power.

Fraternities See Light

For three years, each party has
selected as its presidential candi-
date that man who was most like-
ly to pull the faculty vote. Per-
haps that’s a healthy situation,
giving the last word to the admin-
istration, since it prevents one po-
litical machine from riding rough-
shod over the other. But after last
year’s election, the fraternity boys
began to see its disadvantages.

So this year, an amendment says
that the president shall be elected
from members of the executive
committee by a majority vote of
the entire assembly.

This year, then, it is far more
important than ever before to ob-
tain a majority of the ‘assembly
seats. Last spring the Independ-
ents won with only 12 out of 30
members. The year before, the
fraternities Won with only 13 out
of 30. But this May the majority
has a better than even chance of
success. Which is something, any-
way.

I have no room for the league
standing today, and in substitute I
submit the following quotation
(unauthorized) from the mouth of
Phi Delt Bernie Cashdollar (they
say Caesar was ambitious).

“I guess these things aren't so
important after all.”

Cogito, Ergo Sum!

cause Tuberculosis is far more
prevalent among students than is
syphilis.

OPENED T0 FACULTY ‘

Wide campus support has been
accorded the Tuberculin tests. All
men's and women’s social frater-
nities, SFA, Scabbard and Blade,
ODK, passed resolutions to have
100 per cent member participation
in the project‘.

While the Tuberculin tests had
not at first been offered to faculty
members, due to their lack of in-
terest in the Vx-Iassermann cam-
paign, the test was opened to them
last Monday, because it was felt
that this test vas so important
that faculty members would sup-
port it to a greater extent than
they did the W asscrmann tests.

X-RA.Y OFFERED

Tuberculin tests had been given
free to all students. If a nega-
tive sign resulted, this was a cer-
tain sign that no Tuberculosis was,
or had been present. If the Tu-
berculin reaction was positive, it
mean’; that at one time or another
Tuberculosis had been present,
and that an X-ray photo was ad-
visable to determine whether le-

major event of the social year, is
scheduled for Monday, April 1], in
the Hotel Schenley. It will fea-

ﬁces of each of the fraternities in
cooperation with a well-known

By JERRY HAHN

Adopting an “anti-collective se-
curity” stand, the Intercollegiate
Peace Conference, which met at
Carnegie Institute of Technology
Saturday, adopted several resolu-
tions.

Composed of delegates from col-
leges in the tri—state area, the
Conference was divided into four
commissions: “Analysis of Propa-
ganda,” “April 22 Assembly,”
“Permanent Peace Action,” and
“Economic Causes of War.”

Under the chairmanship
Bernard McKenna, C39, the “Eco-
nomic Causes of War” commission
brought several important resolu-
tions to the ﬁoor of the Confer-
ence.

Their preamble, which was
adopted by the Conference, was
the following: “Whereas, collec-
tive security appears as nothing
more than a military alliance for
the maintenance of an undesirable
status quo dominated by imperial-
;ist. nations: be it resolved by this

] conference that cooperation among

nations be carried on by people of
those nations and not by their re-
spective capitalist governments.” _‘

The gist of the ﬁrst bill passed
included opposition to the May
bill, opposition to a big navy, and
withdrawal of American troops
from China.

Stating that one of the greatest
causes of war today is unequal dis-
tribution of raw materials and
markets among nations, the sec-
ond bill adopted by the confer-
ence, advocated the extension of
reciprocal trade agreements to
“have-not” nations, ‘thereby caus-
ing “peace—loving nations” to abol-
ish trade barriers, international
cartels, export and exchange
quotas against these “less fortun-
ate nations.”

Concluding the Conference at 65
o’clock, the following blanket res-
olution was adopted: “The at-
tempt to remedy economic causes
of present wars, which are effects
ofgmore serious evils, can be alle-
viated if the aforesaid bills are
adopted.”

On Phillippine Proigress

.Cata1ogue Department Head Thinks Islands
‘Are Not Yet-Prepared For Independence’
' ‘ ‘By Alice M. Benovitz S

\Vith Paul McNutt, former high commissioner of the Phil-
ippines, booming his presidential plans, and with the recent ex-
citement in Congress over Philippine independence, it ’s inter-
esting to hear the views of someone who saw and knew the
islands in the first? years of Anierican occupation. '

Miss Emma E. Kinne, head of the catalogue department of
the University, lived in the Philippine Islands from 1909 to
1914. During her residence there she belonged to what is known
as the government class, since her¢
brother was an engineer in charge
of three provinces and she herself
worked in the library of the Bu-
reau of Science.

LIKE A CHILD

According to Miss Kinne, “The
oﬁicial language is English, of
course; but the Spanish aristo-
crats speak Spanish. The natives
use dialects that are corruptions
of Spanish and their own lan-
guage.” She found that most of
the peasants are hungry for edu-
cation. in imitation of the white
residents, they tendto work for
“white collar” positions.

“In spite of their progress in ed- .
ucation, I feelthat they are not
yet ready for inclependence,” said
Miss Kinne. “They remind me of

seize her opportunity there.

But it is not the political situa-
tion that she remembers chieﬂy.
Miss Kinne recalls the nights the
entire white population of the lit-
tle province town went on picnic.
They would all get on a bamboo
raft pulled by a large water buffa-
lo. Where the river was shallow,
the buffalo pulled, and where it
was a little deeper it swam.

She recalls too, the impressive

the little fragile peasant huts
built of nipa, a type of thatch.

Use Of  Theory

By Dordtb Cleland

It was one of ‘the great music inasters Who said tliat rules
for writi.i1;.r music, are made only to be broken, and that, says
Russell W.ic'ln'na1n1, Uinversity organist and organist for the
Shaclysicle Presb_vtcrian church, is What is usu:ill.y done.

“All tl‘icory in. music,” he said, “is taught to form a l)ac.k-
ground: that is the theory any¢ -'
teacher works on. Then the
writer injects his own personality
and departs from those rules.”
Bach, he added, probably broke
more rules for-“writing music in
his time than any other composer,
yet today he is considered one of
the great masters.

Mr. Wichmann plays the early
morning organ music which is
heard in the Commons Room. In
addition to his work at the Shady-
side church and here at the Ca-

 

He added that Gershwin’s rhyth-
mic effects, although they may be
similar to the patterns used by
greater composers, do not have
the subtlety that the other com-
posers succeeded in getting.

Mr. Wichmann received, his
bachelor’s degree in music from
the Lawrence College Conserva-

sin, and took his master’s degree
at the School of Sacred Music in
the Union Theological seminary
in New York, where he studied or-
gen under Clarence Dickinson.

Furthermore, he is a composer.
Last year his anthem won the
Arts Society prize for that type
of composition. He has written
other numbers for voice and
piano. ,

Wichmann who has played both
on the pipe organ and on the elec-
tric organ does not believe that
the electric organ will ever entire-
ly replace the pipe organ. “It
may be more popular in one re-

It seems that Roosevelt
‘~.v.:.:.sn’t the only one who has
haul his troubles with a pedan-
ti«.- judicial bo(ly. A very recent.
:«>nvert to the school of thought
that wants to see a. liberaliz-
erl legal interpretation is Carl
Olson, l’itt"s usually easy-going
'é.=:ack coach, who finds hiinseli
considerably ruffled with the rul-
ings of a West Virginia shot-putt
jurist.

Being very much of a sports-
nzan, Olson has become cognizant
of the rather grave injustices that
can be meted
out when a tri-
bunal stick s,
unﬂinchingly,
to the letter of
the law and ig-
nores the spirit
of that law,
which he be-
l.ieves, and po-_
liticai scientists
agree with him,
on the point, is
far and“ away
the most im-
*-'-:an-‘. element in any kind of a:-

,_ _
iiitr‘.-rtion.

Olson, along '\'-.’ltl‘1 his side—l~:icl-;’
“orny Potts. became concerned
 the l‘ﬂ2‘:l?-El‘ during their re-
-:::-nt exc-ur:-sicn tolthe badlands of
West Virginia. Spending the
‘-:,n—3ek--end. in lvlorgantown, Ols':>n,
:.z::d Potts were at the r newal of
.‘.b:.e annual West Virginia Relays
21 bus-full of their ill—clad

Bazyk was getting ready to

"1 J55 the shot, and Olson, having
ftaiazen careful stock of the rest of
he ﬁeld, was getting ready to put
rive . oints down to the Pitt total.
Well, Johnny stepped up into the‘
‘_".3i.ll€l“ ill-constructed shot-putt
;:ircl»e. It was made up of a com-
position clay and it was bordered
13/ a circle drawn sketchily with
lime.
At this point a gentleman by
:‘;‘;ie name of Miller enters the
story. An old Mountaineer weight-
1‘_‘.‘&l’l, he wasther oﬂicial. He was
'3 perfectly normal gentleman, but
he had one phobia, and that was
Che shot—putt circle.

Consequently, a f t e r B a z y k

Z2/tiller went up to the circle and
noticed that somehow the lime
line had been broken. Being thor-
.)s,:g'nly-grounded in trackk tech-
nicalities, he said that something
must be wrong. And that some-
$:'ning, he declared was Bazyk’s
root which must have touched the
line. Accordingly, he disqualiﬁed
Bazyk. —

Pitt Boxers Compete
In National Tourney

By BILL McELWAIN

Pitt’s pnnchers are looking
for new boxing worlds to con-
quer. ,

The Eastern Intercollegiate
champions left yesterday after-
noon for Charlottesville, Vir-
ginia, where the National Col-
legiate Boxinrr Championships
will be run off tomorrow, Friday,
and Saturday.

The matches will be staged in
the gymnasium of the University
of Virginia. Boxing teams from the
entire country are entered. Eight
Paciﬁc Coast champions are en-
tered in the meet.

The semi-ﬁnals are due tomor—. ‘

row and Friday, with the finals
coming up Saturday.
G FIRST ENTRY
This is the first time the Panth-

ers have ever entered the tourna-

ment, but they
are looking
f 0 r w a rd to
adding the Na-
tional cham-
p i o n s hip to
their Eastern
championship.

Coach Jack
Schricker took
six men with
him, ﬁve of
whom picked
up points in
the Intercol-

Bombe legiate scraps.

Ralph .Dorand, who dropped his
115-pound toga at Morgantown,
will try a comeback in his divi-
sion. With Temple’s Glenn in the
tourney, Dorand will have plenty
of trouble.

The I25-pound Pitt representa-
tive is Johnny Wargo, who is hop-
ing he doesn’t meet Stefanau of
Bucknell. Johnny had clicked off
ﬁve wins this season before the
Bucknell battler stopped him at
Bucknell and in the Intercollegi-
afes."Wai“go also may meet“ Ben
Alperstein, University of Mary-
land, who won the 135—pound
crown last year, but returns this
year to 125-pound.

CURZI IN FORM

Captain Caruso will try to get
back into winning form in the
135—pound class. Ralph has been
beaten by the narrow margins in
his recent ﬁghts.

At 145 pounds, Schricker will
start Jed Curzi, Eastern Intercol-
legiate champion. Sophomore Jed
fought a nearly perfect ﬁght in
upsetting Temple’s Guida at West
Wrdin‘-a and the continuance of

such form should send him a long
way in the National champion-
ships.

Ray Bombe, another Eastern
champ, works in the 155—pound
notch, and has a good chance to
win the National ciown.

The Pitt l65—pounder is Paul
Ashman who took his semi-ﬁnal
match in the Eastern tourney,
only to lose in the ﬁnals.

Pitt will mix mitts withseveral
teams which they met during the
regular season. Temple, West
Virginia, Bucknell, and Penn State
are sending partial line-ups to
the matches. Donato, Tapman,
and Lessig are entered by Penn
State.

The only champion who will de-
fend his National crown, other
than Alperstein, is Ray Schmidt,
175-pounder from the University
~+‘ Virginia.

It was tea time in the Com-
mons Room Monday afternoon.
and who shouldcdrop in for a.
cup of tea, but Mr. John Mc-
Sorley of the Notre Dame Mc-
Sorleys and coach of Pitt ’s
hockey team-

He didn’t refuse VValt.er
Goods invitation to tea, and

said he would talk a little hockey,
if we were so inclined.

McSorley said, right away,
“Frankly, I’rn a little worried
about Western Reserve’s _tie of
John Carroll last night. Reserve
held them, 1-1, and I hear that
Berkeley, the Redcat goalie, had
more than a little to do with it.”

TOUGHER TIME

That sounded funny to us.
After all, John Carroll had the
great Arsenault and Western Re-
serve didn’t have much more than
Berkeley, a grand goalie if there
ever was one. We said as much.

“It might sound funny to you
but it doesn’t to me,” John said,
“I’m telling you right now that
if Reserve beats Carroll, we’ll
have a tougher time ‘with them
than with that Arsenault and his !
ga.ng.”t .

“Reserve.is on the way up,”
and they’ve got a well balanced
team—one that can run you to.
death with good reserves. All
they have needed all season was
to wake up. If they ever begin to
check like they should, look out.” ,

you tie him up, the rest is sim-

“On the other hand,” McSorley
continued, “Reserve has good ﬁrst
lines which are about on a par.
And their coach uses them with
abandon. It keeps the game at
top speed throughout and any-
thing can happen. And don’t for-
get, the last time we played them
the score was, 3-3, with Pitt lucky
to get out of it alive.’’

SKULL DRILL

The coach paused for a breath,
and looked around with disgust at
some of his boys balancing tea
cups. “Which reminds me,” he
turned to Joel Bennett, care-taker
and manager of the hockey mena-
gerie, “Where are all the boys?”

“I’m hgge for a black—board

uerto Ricans Decry
an-America League

Both Teams Take’

Negative View

In Novel ‘Debate’

By RUGY ALDISERT

An American League of Na-
tions is not practical, not need-
ed, and not Wanted, 111 the opin-
ion of four student speakers
representing Men’s Debating‘
Association and the Unive1's1t_\,'
of l’ue,rto Rico debating team,
who spoke at last Monday’s In-
quiry Forum.

Departing from standards of
formal debating, Oregon debating,
and symposium debating, Univer-
sity speakers and the Puerto R1-
cans granted the negative of the
question: “Should an American
League of Nations be established?”

Abe Wolovitz, C40, and William
Stark, C38, University students,
decried a continental league.
Puerto Rico was represented by
law students Rafael Martinez and
Luis Berrios who also objected to
such a league.

CONTINUE NEGATIVE

“United States history regard-
ing Pan-American affairs shows
the United States dominating
through the use of force,” declared
Wolovitz, opening the symposium.
“The use of force is inimical to the
success of such a league, which
must depend upon cooperation.”

Surprising the University de-
baters, Martinez continued the
case against a continental league,
citing examples in which South
American countries were against
such a proposal.

“The ABC powers, Argentina,
Brazil, and Chile, are indifferent
to the idea of a American league,
if not absolutely opposed to it,”
announced the Puerto Rican law
student. “Besides, there is no he-
cessity for it because the problems
which this organization would be
set up to solve are now being
solved through the mechanism of
peace.”

LEAGUE NOT PRACTICAL

Berrios then "brought forward
the information that 19 Latin-
American countries are protesting
because Italy, Germany, and Japan
are looking in this hemisphere for
colonies with raw materials.

“But my objection to a league,”
he continued, “is that. it would not
be practical. Imagine the United
States accepting equality with
San Domingo in representation!”

Concluding the discussion, Stark
pointed out that South Americans,
have traditions and customs pat-
terned after European models.
“America is tired of the dirty,
nasty, treachery of South Ameri-
can history. We must agree that
an American league would result
in United States domination. So
if it is economically unnecessary,
culturally incongruous, and poli-
tically inadvisable, why have it?”

ON ANNUAL TOUR

The Puerto Rican debaters are
on their annual tour of American
colleges and universities. Arriv-
ing Monday morning after a radio
panel discussion in Washington, D.
C., with George Washington, Cor-
nell, and Virginia universities,
they stopped in Pittsburgh for
Mondajfs forum and an appear-
ance on Dr. Clausen’s round table
discussion over KDKA last night.
From here they ﬂew to Middle-
bury college.

“Even if we are American citi-
zens, our debates always take on
an international complex,” ex-
plained Arturo Morales Carrion,
their coach, who is a member of
the department of social science
at the University of Puerto Rico.
“Our debate tours take on a two-
fold purpose. Besides offering our
students an opportunity to meet
other debaters, we also act as
friendly propagandists for the is-
land and people of Puerto Rico.”

Business Level
Remains Same

Pittsburgh’s business level for
the past week was almost un-
changed, with the production in-
dex advancing over last week,
and both the trade and shipment

indices decreasing, according
to the Bureau of Business Re-
sear 

  

Instrial operations of steel
and tin plate mills are higher;

teddy bear artist. They are the
nicest things in the show.

But the attempts to do literal
transcriptions of animals are not
so well done. One good-natured
wolf, for example, would never
eat anybody, and the same goes
for a powerfully constructed
mountain goat, who could not even
knock over a milk bottle. This is
different than the work of the
younger children, who emphasize
the qualities of the things they
draw, even though their grasp of
technique is naturally faulty.

Somewhat in the vein of the
donkey and teddy bear are two
bird pictures by Messrs. Baird and
Wolfson. One is a pelican, and
the other is some bird that eats
bananas and locks its spouse up
in a tree to lay eggs. I forget just
what they are called.

The idea of the children’s art
class was put into effect by Miss
Margaret Lee of the Pittsburgh
Public Schools.

That the number of positive re-

may be seen in the fact that ap-

X—ray photos. Appointments to
take the X—ray, are being made
by Miss Dobrick in the men’s

Though today will be the ﬁnal
