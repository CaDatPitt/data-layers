Pitt’s Student Government Board will
ofﬁcially decide when the paper cop-
ies of The New York Times and USA
Today will return to campus at Tues-
day night’s weekly public meeting.
The Board has already voted to
extend the Collegiate Readership
Program that provides students with
online and paper access to copies of
the newspapers. Since the suspension
of the program over winter break,

   

students have still had access to the
online replica editions, but now the
board will vote if the paper copies
will come back immediately or the
ﬁrst week after spring break.

The Board was supposed to hold
a vote on Friday to decide when the
papers will return to campus, but
over the weekend, SGB President
James Landreneau said he wanted
to conduct the vote oﬂicially at the
public meeting this Tuesday.

“Any formal vote, I prefer that it
is public,” Landreneau said.

If the papers return immediately,

they will be distributed as beforein

open newsstands around campus
until the arrival of the locked drop
boxes. _, ,

“If we start this program earlier,
there would be an added cost,” Lan-
dreneau said.

‘He explained that the Board
only pays for the newspapers that
are picked up. If the papers are left

unguarded in the newsstands like h

before, there is a higher probability
that more papers will be picked up,
and the University will be charged
more.

If colleges can’t keep their tuition
from going up each year, then the
amount of federal funding they re-
ceive will go down — if President
Barack Obama gets his way.

“If tuition is going up faster
than inﬂation, faster than even
health care is going up, no matter
how much we subsidize it, sooner
or later, we’re going to run out of
money,” Obama _said in a speech
to students at the University of
Michigan on Friday morning. “And
that means that others have to do
their part. Colleges and universi-
ties need to do their part to keep
costs down as well.”

In his State of the ‘Union ad-
dress last week, Obama laid out
a blueprint to make an economy
that’s built to last — and this
includes tackling rising tuition
costs. He is proposing new re-
forms tohelp students deal with

a high tuition and placing the re-
sponsibility on the government,
states, universities and adminis—
trations to lower the costs.

The proposals, which require
congressional approval, would

. seek to tie colleges’ eligibility to
receive federal campus-based aid
programs, including Perkins loans
and work—study jobs, to their abil-
ity to increase affordability and
keep value high for students.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
was unavailable for immediate
comment on how these proposals
would affect the University.

ocal theater copany staes murder mystery for Pitt students

The actors kept audience members laugh-
ing throughout the evening with jokes that

By Gwenn Barney
Senior Staﬂ” Writer

On Sunday night a murder took place at
Pitt, but this one didn’t make the police
blotter. ‘

About 60 Pitt students witnessed famed
gangster Vinnie Vermicelli stumble into the
room with a red substance seeping from an
icicle-stabbed wound on his back as they
enjoyed dinner in the O’Hara Student Center
ballroom.

For three hours, Pittsburgh-based Mys-
tery’s Most Wanted theatre troupe trans-
formed the ballroom into a 1920s speakeasy
for their dinner theater event, called “Mob-
sters, Molls and Marinara.” Pitt Program
Council brought in the interactive dinner
theater company for a night of entertain-
ment where students analyzed the motives

and testimony of four murder. suspects,

framing one at the end of the night.

The show put students in detective roles
as they tried to determine which character
murdered Vermicelli, played by Steven Wer-
ber, based on clues provided by the actors.
The actors traveled around the tables of
students chowing on an array of chicken,
beef and cheesecake, chatting with them and
subtly providing clues about the murder.

“The killer is among us,” psychic Natasha
Levushkin, played by actress Barbara Wil-
liams, warned the audience. V A

Suspects included Levushkin, private
detective Ray Ricotta (Randy Oliva), ﬂap-
per Shirley Laverne (Joanna Lowe) and
singer—comedian Wayne Starch (W. Laszlo
Holman). _

The shows’ characters took turns“ going
over the motives for each potential suspect.
All the suspects owed Vermicelli money, but
which one was so indebted to Vermicelli that

“Tower A, Tower
B, Tower C — they
were all afraid of us.”
— Vinnie Vermicelli

touched upon everything from the movie
Brokeback Mountain to former Speaker
of the House and Republican presidential
candidate Newt Gingrich.

The theater‘ group added Pitt touches to
their usual show. .

“Tower A, Tower B, Tower C — they were
all afraid of us,“ Vinnie said to the audience
early in the show. .

At another point Vinnie warns Detec-

- tive Ricotta, “You are a’ sissy. Unless you

order a large order of fries from the 0, then
you’re not.” ‘

Everyone in the audience dressed up for
the event in their best dinner party outﬁts,
ﬁtting in well with the actors, who wore
ﬂapper dresses, bow ties and fedoras.

Besides solving the mystery, the show
included other elements of audience partici-
pation. Some students took on roles reading
lines off pieces of paper in dialogue with
the actors.

Senior Blair ‘Suter put on a fedora and

took on the role of Johnny, Vermicelli’s,

If the Board votes to wait, students will have
to wait until the drop boxes arrive in March for
access to the paper copies.

USA Today and The New York Times will
provide the drop boxes, but Pitt will provide the
swipe system. Students will swipe their student
IDs through a card reader, much like at dorm
rooms and gyms, that will give them access to
open the box and grab a paper.

The boxes are included in the cost of the
program. They were not implemented last se-

mester because the program was still in the _

pilot stage, but now that the Board has extended
the program, the drop boxes will be added to
campus. The Student Activity Fund — which
comes from the $80 student activities fee that
each non—College of General Studies student
pays each semester —- pays for the program.

Board members also hope that students
will reap further beneﬁts of the program, such
as the potential to bring a speaker or lecturer
to campus and limited access to a full online
version of the texts. The ﬁrst 300 students each
day will have ﬁill access to the online edition of
the newspapers, and every student who logs
on after will have access to replica editions of
the texts.

“In order for [the program] to reach as many
students as possible, we really need to utilize the
online edition,” Board member Natalie Roth-
enberger said. “I am excited to work with the
Board to promote [the online component] .” I

listed Pitt’s $14,154 in-state tuition last
year as the second most expensive nation-
ally among public universities. After a 22
percent cut in state funding in June, Pitt
raised in-state tuition 8.5 percent.

Over the summer, Pitt ofﬁcials attributed
the ranking to a low level of state support
for higher education — the 46th lowest in
the country. ‘

On Friday afternoon, U.S. Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan and Director of the
Domestic Policy Council at the White House
Cecilia Muﬁoz outlined Obama’s plans in a
conference call.

“In a competitive economy, we can’t af-
ford for college to be a privilege,” Muﬁoz

. said.

He said that for the ﬁrst time, federal
student aid is being tied to tuition poli-
cies.

Duncan laid out Obama’s four proposals.
They include rewarding schools that keep
college affordable and net tuition down;
new incentives for colleges to hold down
costs, including a $1 billion ‘Race to the Top’
challenge for states; creating a scorecard to
make it easier for families and prospective
students to compare schools; and main-
taining the administration’s current com-
mitment to helping students and calling
on Congress to keep their commitment to
federal student aid.

The last proposal includes keeping the
interest rate on student loans at 3.4 percent,
instead of having it double to 6.8 percent in
July. It also includes making the American
Opportunity Tax Credit, a tuition tax credit,
permanent and doubling the number of
work—study jobs over the next ﬁve years;

The officials on the call said that in order
to judge colleges’ value and tuition, the
measure to which their federal aid will be
tied, the government will look at more than
just tuition. They will also measure the net
price, graduation rates, repayment rates
on student loans and support structures,
as well as -what the colleges are doing to
serve disadvantaged students.

Duncan said that more than 40 states
cut their higher education budgets last year.
These proposals are meant in part to pro-
mote shared responsibility on the states to
deal with tuition costs.

“States can’t keep cutting higher edu-
cation budgets and expect universities
to make up the difference in tuition,” he
said.

Obama said that tuition is going up
faster than inﬂation and faster than health
care costs, and the government will soon
run out of money if it keeps subsidizing
tuition costs. Others, including colleges
and universities, need to do their part to
keep costs down, he said.

“Higher education is not a luxury,”
Obama said on Friday. “It’s an economic
imperative that every family in America
should be able to afford.” I

“It was ﬁin. I think I probably could have
done more improv, but I wasn’t sure how
much they wanted me to do,” Suter said, who
ended up shooting the murderer earlier than
the actors told him to.

Suter attended the event with his girl-
friend, senior Lauren Agee, which made for
a humorous moment when ﬂapper character
Shirley Laverne sat on his lap during the
show.

“It was a little weird,” Agee said of the
ﬂapper’s advances, ﬁctional or not.

Oliva, the founder of Mystery’s Most
Wanted, said the company always has a great
time at Pitt — although they have not visited
campus since 2008.

“This was our fourth or ﬁfth show here.
Even though it takes place in the ’2os, we
really try to make it more current for the
college students,” he said.

PPC recreation Directorjim Dougherty
said these kinds of shows usually cost up-
wards of $25 to $30. But, through the student
activities fee, the organization was able to
bring the cost down to $5 per person.

At show’s end, the actors invited audience
members to write down their guess of who
committed the murder. Only a handful of

students chose the murderer correctly: the

psychic Natasha Levushkin.
“It went much better than I anticipated,”
Dougherty said. “It was a lot of fun.”I

History’s fun aspects ignored

  i£I'fi>.’5 a lJJl2Il[l),

By Mark Kozlowski
' Columnist

 

/
Historicalfigures are all so dead.

Worse than dead, in fact — bor-

ing and musty.

We should be forgiven for
this impression, given what
they teach us in grade school.
We usually learn all the serious
bits about historical figures’
lives, and, if they’re really im-
portant, like George Washington
or Thomas Jefferson or Abraham
Lincoln, they’re elevated to al-
most demigod status. Most gods
aren’t known for having fun or
for being any fun at ‘all.

But our conception of these
people isn’t entirely accurate.
Mozart wrote not one, but two
different “Kiss My Ass” canons,
K. 231 and K. 559, one of which
(Difﬁcile Lectu, K. 559) relied on
the fact that the lead singer at its
likely ﬁrst performance, a friend
of Mozart’s, had a heavy Bavar-
ian accent. ].S. Bach’s Coffee Can-
tata is quite lighthearted, and its
grumpy-old—man character might
be humorously self-referential.
Lincoln was an inveterate jokester
and storyteller -— there’s a fa-
mous cartoon that makes fun of
this tendency. Benjamin Franklin
was very interested in having fun.
Legend has it that he wasn’t given

the lead authorship on the Decla-
ration of Independence because
the Second Continental Congress
feared. he would slip in ajoke.
Furthermore, Franklin was not
at all averse to female company,
even at a ripe old age, and it is of-
ten impossible to tell in his writ-
ing when he’s kidding and when
he’s speaking in earnest. Ronald
Reagan’s sense of humor is re—
membered, but Gerald Ford, not
usually considered very exciting,
landed at least one good quip at
Reagan’s expense during the 1976
presidential primaries.

So why do grade school teach-
ers ignore the most fun aspects of
historyin favor of the dramatic?
Partly because we have a sort of
reverence for the past. Partly,
as well, because we revere the
dead, and partly because most
of the history we learn is serious
business, with serious battles,
serious and weighty discussions,
and a seriously large number of
dates we have to memorize for
the quiz next week. Furthermore,
the study of history is limited by
what people bothered to write
down. As nobody wanted to ap-
pear frivolous, what was most
frequently recorded concerned
the most weighty of matters. And
usually, we only have time to dis-
cuss the serious stuff.

Why is this absence of levity a

Pitt heads to Morgantown for Backyard Brawl

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
snapped an eight—game losing
streak with home victories against
Providence and No. 9 Georgetown
last week, but to continue the climb
from the Big East’s basement, the
Panthers will have to do something
they have struggled with this sea-
son: leave behind their home—court
advantage and win in a hostile envi-
ronment.

Pitt travels to Morgantown to

face the West Virginia Mountaineers
(15-7, 5-4 Big East) Monday at 7 p.m.
in the 183rd basketball edition of the
Backyard Brawl. .

The Panthers (13—9, 2-7 Big East)
are 2-4 in true road games this year,
dropping their last four. The Moun-
taineers are undefeated in confer-
ence play at the West Virginia Uni-
versity Coliseum.

West Virginia enters the game
coming off a controversial 63-61
loss on Saturday at No. 3 Syracuse.
With fewer than 10 seconds to play,
Orange center Baye Moussa Keita
appeared to interfere with Moun-
taineer forward Deniz Kilicli’s

game-tying layup on its way into
the basket. The officiating crew,
though, missed the goaltend, and
the Mountaineers received their
second consecutive loss. T

“Do I think it was [a goaltend]?
N o. I know it was,” West Virginia
head coach Bob Huggins said in a
press conference after the loss. “I
saw the replay.”

The Mountaineers will try to
move on from the controversy Mon-
day, something that they couldn’t do
when they maintained possession
after the no-call.

“It’s hard,” Huggins said. “You’ve

SHOT DOWN

Pitt rolled over No. 9-ranked

Georgetown, giving new life to a season
that was nearly lost

By Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ” Writer

The No. 9 ranked Georgetown
Hoyas should have seen it coming.
After all, the Panthers were 11-0
all—time against top—10 teams at
the Petersen Events Center.

With a 72-60 victory on Satur-
day, Pitt improved that number to
12-0, picking up the biggest victory
of its season and one that could
spark a season turnaround.

“We see the rankings just like
everyone else,” junior guard Tra-
Von Woodall said after the game.
“We always try to get up for these
games and go after teams like they
would go after us.”

After losing eight consecutive

1 games, the Panthers (13—9, 2-7 Big

East) followed Wednesday’s victory
over Providence with a dominating
performance against the Hoyas
(16—4, 6-3 Big East).

“We came into this game with
the mentality that we had to im-
prove, even from the Providence
win,” head coachjamie Dixon said
in the post game press conference.
“Looking at these last two games,
that is who we are as a team.”

The Panthers held the lead from
the opening possession as sopho-
more forward Lamar Patterson
drained a three-point basket as
the shot clock expired.

Patterson finished with 18
points and was joined by Ash-
ton Gibbs and Nasir Robinson in
double-digit scoring ﬁgures. Gibbs
posted 13 while Robinson led all
players with his 23.

Dixon said that Patterson has
played well lately, especially as
his understanding of his position
grows. 1

“Lamar is starting to realize
how many minutes he will be
playing and what his role will be
in those minutes,” Dixon said. “He
is the perfect indication of a player
stepping into a new role and doing

what he needs to do — passing,
getting the assists and rebounding
when needed.” ”

Throughout its losing streak,
Pitt struggled to ﬁnd the basket,
but the offense was potent against
Georgetown. The Panthers ﬁnished
shooting 52.1 percent on the night.

The shots were certainly falling for '1

Robinson, who was a perfect 9-9
from the ﬁeld -— his only missed
shot coming on a free-throw at-
tempt with 1:21 remaining in the
game.

“Nasir let things come to him,
and that is what he needs to do,”

- Dixon said of the forward’s perfor-

mance. “He hurt [Georgetown] in
zone and in man-to:m_an defense,
and you cannot say enough about
his toughness.”

Another key to the Panthers’of- 

fense was the continued contribu-
tion of Woodall, who was playing
in his third game back from an ab-
dominal and groin injury. Woodall
ﬁnished with only 4 points, but his
ten assists were instrumental in his
teammates’ success.

“Tray is a playmaker for us,”
Gibbs said of the point guard. “He
has experience in every situation,
and he creates open looks for us.
With Tray in the line—up, the best
is yet to come from us.”

The Panthers defense was just
as instrumental in the win, as it
held the Hoyas to an overall shoot-
ing percentage of 42.1 percent and

.‘I

kept them below their average of
72 points per game. “‘

For Patterson, the efforts
against Georgetown validated the
Panthers’ commitment to playing
strong defense.

“We wanted to come out and

be aggressive and hold our ground 

defensively,” Patterson said. “We
have not done that much this year,
and we wanted to show everyone
that we could get it done on de-
fense.” I
Georgetown was led offensively .

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Pitt falls to Providence

By Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team lost its
eighth straight conference game on the road
to the Providence Friars by a score of 66-50
on Saturday.

After losing by 76 points to Notre Dame
two weeks ago, Panthers head coach Agnus
Berenato declared the start of a “new sea-
son” for the women. But so far, that new
season has not been kind to Pitt (8-12, 0-8
Big East).as it has fallen to 0-2 and now rides
a seven—game losing streak.

Pitt out—rebounded the Friars (11—9, 4-4
Big East) 35-31, pulling in 10 of those on the
offensive end. The real difference seemed to
come from the team’s turnovers. Pitt had 18
turnovers while the Friars only had 10.’

More trouble came from a disappointing
performance by the starters. The young and
inexperienced starters scored only 25 of the
team’s total 50 points. The Friars’ starting
ﬁve performed much better, scoring 53 of
the 66 total team points.

Despite this, the Panthers see real «leader~
ship from 5-foot—6 freshman guard Brianna
Kiesel, who scored 17_points, shootingeight
of 16 from the ﬁeld. She also pulled in four
rebounds.

got 30 seconds, and you’re trying to get them
refocused, and they’re all thinking about other
things.”

Meanwhile, Pitt’s build up to the Backyard
Brawl comes with a little more serenity thanks
to the return of point guard Travon Woodall
from abdominal and groin injuries. Woodall
struggled against Louisville last Saturday in
his ﬁrst start back, but after tallying 19 assists
in his last two games, it seems he is back to
his old self. .

“With Tray out there, it just allows guys to
do more and be in a more comfortable role,”
Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said after Sat-
urday’s 72-60 win against Georgetown. Pitt
had 20 assists on 25 ﬁeld goals against the
Hoyas. - !

Woodall averages 7.4 assists per game, al-
though he does not lead the conference in that
category because he has not played enough
games to qualify. ‘ S 7

“He is deﬁnitely a playmaker for us, and
at the same time he’s a guy with experience,”

- senior guard Ashton Gibbs said after the Hoyas

- game. “In pressuresituations, we know what

we’re getting out of him. We have a lot of con-

~ ﬁdence in him and now that he’s back, I think i

the best is yet to comefor this team.”

Gibbs leads the Panthers this year with 16.5
points per game.

Pitt beat Georgetown withstrong play in
the paint from senior Nasir Robinson, who
ﬁnished Saturday’s game perfect from the ﬁeld
with 23 points and eight rebounds. ,

“He has a knackfor being in the right place
at the right time,” Dixon said. “He hurt them
in zone defense, and he hurt them in man
defense as well. He did a great job from the
free-throw line, and I thought he did great
defensively as well.”

But Robinson, Talib Zanna and Dante Tay-
lorwill have their hands full Monday with West
Virginia’s Kevinjones, a 6—foot-8 forward who
can hit shots from the perimeter. The senior
averages a double—double, registering 20.9
points and 11.4 rebounds per game. He leads
the Big East in both scoring and rebounding.

Jones is one reason why West Virginia could

be Pitt’s biggest challenge on the glass thus far. _

Only Pitt has a better rebounding margin in the
Big East than West Virginia, and the physicality
that comes with this rivalry should‘ make it a
true battle inside. a

Senior guard Darryl Bryant complements
Jones’ interior presence with 17.1 points per
game, the sixth—best average in the confer-
ence.Jones and Bryant each play more than 36
minutes per game, as Huggins has struggled to
ﬁnd ‘depth from his roster of four upperclass—
men and nine freshmen.

The inexperience has hurt the Mountain-
eers defensively. They rank in the bottom half
of the Big East, allowing an average of 66.3
points per game. Coming off one of its best
offensive performances yet, Pitt will look to be
the aggressors on the offensive side of the ball
and take advantage of West Virginia’s youth.

Tipoff is set for 7 p.m., and the game will V

be covered by ESPN. 3

who scored 14 points ‘off the bench. Senior
guard Jason Clark, who entered the con-
test averaging 17 points per game, was held
to 9 points while going 0-3 from 3-point
range.

Part of the Panthers’ defensive success
comes from an impressive rebounding per-

formance against Georgetown’s taller inside"

players. _

Despite being outsized underneath the
basket, the Panthers managed to secure
35 boards, 29 of them defensive, while the
Hoyas pulled down just 23 total rebounds.

 

Talib Zanna had a game-high 10 boards
while Robinson chipped in with eight.

Pitt was especially dominant in the ﬁrst
twenty minutes of play, when it built its larg-
est lead of 17 points with about four minutes
remaining in the half and entered the locker
room with a 33-22 lead.

As thesecond half opened, Georgetown
came out battling, and the Hoyas were able
to cut the Panther lead to six at the 4:09
mark, making the score 49-55.

But the very next play helped the Pan-
thers pull away for the ﬁnal time, illustrating
the unselﬁsh style of play that helped lead
to the victory.

When the Panthers regained possession
after a foul shot, they ran the ﬂoor, and Pat-

-   Alternative   '

Break

terson dealt one of his seven assists to Dante
Taylor, who ﬁnished the play with a dunk.

“When we have everyone out on the ﬂoor,
we are a good offensive team, passing well
and getting penetration,” Dixon said. “We
moved the ball better today than we have‘,
been, and I am proud of our team.”

The Panthers will have a quick turn— 5

around before their next Big East contest
on Monday as they travel to Morgantown,
WV, to take on the Mountaineers in the bas-
ketball version of the Backyard Brawl.
“Every game and every home court i§
tough in this conference,” Dixon said. “We
will prepare hard for this game, and I am cer-
tain we will continue to improve in the future
because that is what we can control.” i
