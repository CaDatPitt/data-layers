City Planning Bureau Passessi
University Plan to Cut Curbs 
For W7heelchair Students  

’  By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

Handles have been placed on the outside of ﬁredoors, following the recommend"
dation of the group considering handicapped students. The University has also -ob-‘
tained approval from the City’s Bureau of Traffic Planning to cut curbs for wheel?
chair students at three major campus locations. Temporary ramps will also be placed,
within the Cathedral to improve accessibility to ﬁrst ﬂoor classrooms. I

According to Captain Liles W. Creighton, assistant director of the

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, Assistant Chancellor of Student and Gen-

the group considering handicapped students that “the City was

Captain Creighton indicated that he was skeptical of the pro-

D13 Litchfield Reveals  
Faculty Housing Plans

Chancellor ‘Edward H. Litchﬁeld has revealed that
construction of new faculty homes should begin this fall.

This is the ﬁrst step in a new

four—point program to create

adequate housing on and near the Oakland campus.
' The initial phase will consist of construction of the
“casbah” project on the hill above Engineering Hall.
This project, which has. been modiﬁed to bring down costs to a

reasonable level, calls for 80 units

of two and three bedroom homes.

V Other Units Planned A
The second step will be construction of ‘another 12 to 15 units
on other University property‘ already zoned for residential housing.

The third step will be the 9

renewal and renovation of ex-
_ isting housing in Shadyside and
Oakland,

The ﬁnal step will be the addi-
tion of still more apartments.

For eligible faculty all kinds of
housing would be available on the
University mortgage plan, which
permits up to 95 per cent borrow-
ing on acceptable housing near the
campus.

Faculty To Set
Integrity Policy

The Student Affairs Committee
recommended at its meeting last
Tuesday that the faculty initiate
a restatement of policy on stu-
dent dishonesty which the Com-
mittee .lNlll edit and promote in a
school-wide endorsement.

Professor of Psychology Dr.
George Fahey asked to join the
Committee for this discussion last
week, stated that he would take
the matter back to the Educational
Policies Committee of the Univer-
sity Senate. The draft should
ready by fall. -

The Committee agreed that em-
phasis should be placed on atti-
tude rather than punishment,
Sincethe faculty is primarily re-
sponsible for establishing an at-,

 

mosphere which values academic .

costly than “a regular driveway.” i
“This will run into some money." We will get the plans
ready and present them soon,” Captain Creighton said. He also
explained that the curb cuts would require special fanning‘ ef-
fects to promote pedestrian safety. He also expressed his hope
V that the A“city. will continue to be very considerate and go along
with us.” A
CL Ramps Approved

The proposal to place ramps over the smaller stairs on the ﬁrst-

floor of the Cathedral was readily approved. Dr. Rankin noted. that
‘-‘one ramp just outside of my oﬂice would serve this whole half of
the Cathedral. If ramps were put on the stairs facing Fifth Avenue
and Forbes Street, the majority of the ﬁrst ﬂoor classrooms of the
Cathedral would be covered.”

Handicapped student Dave Weir noted that handicapped‘ stu-
dents “don’t L request curb modiﬁcations to go to non-University
places, such as The Pitt Tavern.” Dr. Thompson commented: “I
should think you would need one to get back from the "Pitt Tavern.”

Dr. Rankin closed the meeting by expressing his hope tha
“something might be accomplished by Fall." ' '

a Syrian National began an

International Relations Club debete on “U. S. Policy in the
Near East” which eventually turned into a one-sided audi-
ence question on the “so-called state of Israel," last Tues-
day in the Stephen Foster‘ social hall.

Moshe Amitay, an Israeli physics student studying at

logy opened the debate with a
speech highlighting the primary
factors operating on U.S. policy
as he saw from an Israelilpoint of
view. Amitay pointed out the
bonds existing between these two
nations. v
An ingrained sympathy -for a
struggling nation, commitment to
the Bible and an affinity of “the
U.S. and Israeli democratic re-
gimes helps communication” be-
tween the ‘two states. Respect for
Is_raeli's political, cultural, and
scientific achievements, and the
relation of American Jews to the
state of Israel are other important
factorswhich have contributed to
the shaping of U.S. policy in this
‘area ‘of’ the world." s

Amitay feels, however, that
U.S. sympathies toward Israel
are limited by economic inter-
ests, especially oil, in the Arab
middle east.

Soleiman Nassar, a Syrian
mathematics major studying at
the University, took a negative
view of United States support for
Israel. Before World War One,
Nassar said, thé_U.S. had no Mid-

people, but even at this time the
U.S. had no speciﬁc interests in
this area.

4 Arabs Oppose Zionism

The Arabs have always been
opposed to Zionism, a movement
by the Jewish people fora state
in the East. Nassar feels that the
relatively recent positive position

on the part of U.S. politicians to-

ward Zionism resulted from pres-
sure of Jewish constituents espe-
cially in the 1940’s, to support the
creation of the State of Israel.
Nassar said that the Arabs do
not like this U.S. policy which
he sees as the result of the ac-
tions of a minority pressure
The Arabs regard the
Israelis as invaders rather than
as refugees in the Middle East.
The state of Israel, Nassar ex-
plained, was carved out of Arab
land. ' «

U.S. support for the creation of
this Jewish state, Nassar equated

to a hypothetial resolution of the .

See You A2 t Intermission . . .

By Wayne Cioeren

The theater season now’drawing to a
close in New York has been an above av-
erage one for Broadway both in terms of
quality and success. Most of the season’s
hits will be playing throughout the sum-
mer and will be an attraction‘ to those
visiting or returning home to the" New
York area over a week-end or at the end
ofithe trimester.

One of thelbest plays now-ion Broadway is
“Dylan,” starring Alec Guinness. Though given
somewhat less publicity than the lavish musi-
cals and the much discussed “Hamlet,” “Dlyan’s”
box oﬂ"ice.has steadily grown since Sir Alec won
the Toni award for his portrayal of the Welsh

poet. 1
— \
The award was much deserved. Anyone de-

. ciding on which of several good shows to see in

.3

New York should consider seeing one of today’s'

ﬁnestactors in an excellent play.
Dylan’s Talents and Faults

Dylan Thomas, after writing “Under Milk
Wood” and a reasonably small amount of_ wide-
ly praised poetry, proceeded to drink himself to
death. “Dylan,” which deals mainly with the
poet’s two lecture tours in the United States,
presents neither an overly sympathetic view
nor a belligerent one. “Dylan” is aiman like all

men with talents and faults. His dreams are-

many, his accomplishments few but signiﬁcant,
his tragedy of his own making.'» -
The audience comes to know and like him
because of the depth in which they come to
«understand him. This‘ is. true: "because of the
excellent script by Sidney ,Michaels and be-
cause of a brilliant andrevealing perform-
ance by Sir Alec. , _
- Most plays, good or—great, take a while to
warm up. Not so this time. As -the curtain rises

.Dylan is found sitting alone on the beach. The

character study achieved by actor and director

. in this picture at once tells the entire story of

Dylan and creates a mystery about him which
everyone seeks to, understand.‘

Students Debate Mid-East Policy

The poet’s wife, Cait1in,_ appears on a high
stairway, and there follows one of the finest
opening scenes I have ever witnessed. The audi-
en‘ce is held captive from the first. . , J

Reid Matches Sir Alec’s Performance

Kate Reid, formerly in “Who’s Afraid of Vir-
ginia Woolf,” is perfect as Caitlin Thomas and
matches Sir Alec’s iperformarticyein 7 every re-

spect, bringing the play exact "harmony and_

balance.

U The "supporting cast is goodbut sometimes
not on the same level. with the two leads.
Barbara Berjer is sometimes shallow in her
difficult ‘roles as Dylan's American mistress,
and Jenny O’Hara, as another American .ad-
mirer, over plays a bit. The rest of the cast

A is quite solid.

The staging of the show is one of the out-
standing features. An interesting combination
of ﬁlm techniques, such as music bridges and

the fading‘ of one scene into‘ the next, and mod-

ern stage techniques, such as revolving skeleton
sets, add an intriging touch to the play with-
out distracting from the action.. .

Dialogue Brilliant

The dialogue, as mentioned, is. brilliant.«It
is ‘both hilarious and tragic, as the human sit-
uation often is. The. hero’s faults and his vir-
tues are so nearly the same that both poles of
the emotions are excited. We laugh at him, pity‘

him, are disgused with him, and admire him‘

all at once.

“Dylan” seeks neither to"preach nor to
apologize, but’ merely to show the man and
the poet as he was. Some might charge a lack
of ethics in the play due to the ﬂip treat-
ment given the hero’s vices which were many
and extreme. ‘But this treatment is in line
with revealing the character of the man Dy-
'lan Thomas. ' -

In the well written and superbly acted pro-
duction of “Dylan” every man can see some-
thing of himself -——. the man he wants, to be,
the man he doesn’t want to be, the man" he is.

See you at intermission.

Although" this year’s' base’-

bright for next:year’s team.
Five starters return next
year: two outﬁelders, two in-
ﬁelders and a catcher.

The two returning outﬁelders,
Fred Mazurek (center ﬁeld) and
Barry Wetzel (left ﬁeld) were the
two leading hitters this year. The
others are Steve Eiseman, Larry
Szykowny, and Doug Chambers.

Mazurek ﬁnished the season
with a .366 batting average. In ad-
dition to leading the team in bat-

In addition, Mazurek led the

slightly less impressive. He was’

6, total bases, 31, and batting
