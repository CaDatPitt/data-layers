University of Pittsburgh  

‘The Pitt News

Thursday, January 26, 1995

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt’s plans to build a 300 to
400-bed residence hall falls short
of the university’s housing needs
by 1,800 beds, but it’s a good
start.

That’s what some community
residents have said following
Pitt’s announcement that it may
use the Burger King site on Fifth
Avenue for a new residence hall,
said Robin Jones, chair of the
Community Interface with the
Master Space Plan Committee
(CIMP.)

“We’re urging Pitt to address
that shortage,” said the chair—of
the city’s Planning Commission,
Thomas Armstrong.

Community groups have not

yet seen the plans for the resi-
dence hall, Jones said. Residents
will be concerned about the size
of it as well as whether Pitt will
retain commercial space in the
building.

“There’s been a trend as the
university has expanded along
Forbes and Fifth to reduce the
commercial space and not replace
it with other commercial space,”
Jones said. , ’

‘Ben Tuchi, senior vice chancel-
lor for business and finance,
could not say whether retail space
would be maintained in the build-
ing as Oakland groups would
like. 3 ,

“We’ve got to recognize that
while many interests can be
expressed, we have a financial
responsibility we have to consid-

er. We just don’t know the answer
to a lot of the questions that might
occur.”

The project will be a joint ven-
ture between the university and
private developers, he said. The
residence hall will be built within
the next five years. I

Tuchi could not estimate the
cost because the characteristics of
the building have yet to be out-
lined. Tuchi proposed the project
to the Planning Commission
Tuesday.

Both the Planning Commission
and Oakland residents have
repeatedly urged the university to
address its housing shortage.
Residents have also complained
that Pitt hasn’t taken enough
responsibility for the students liv-
ing off—campus in slum condi-

tions and with absentee landlords.

Providing new housing would
improve traffic conditions and
relieve some of the pressures resi-
dents feel from having students
living in the neighborhoods,
Armstrong said. Noisy parties
and lack of upkeep of the proper-
ty are some of the problems that
have bothered residents.

But Pitt’s first priority was to
upgrade the present residence
halls, Tuchi said.

“What do you do with the old
housing?” he said. “You cannot
abandon it. We have to protect
the assets we have.”

Pitt’s announcement of plans
for the new residence hall proves
the university’s willingness to
cooperate with residents and the

New light shines an

’’evil eye”

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

The bizarre attack that took
place outside Caleco’s over a

week ago has taken another

step toward the twilight
zone.

Two individuals, one a Pitt
student, were arrested by
campus police after beating
another student for apparent-
ly giving the suspect the
“evil eye.”

According to Pitt Director
of Public Safety Rick Boyd,
two days after the arrests
were made, friends of the
suspect came forward and
said the suspect was also a
“victim.” There were reports
that the original victim of the
beating “had been terrorizing
her floor” throughout the
yean

It was originally reported
in The Pitt News that accord-
ing to the police report, one
of the suspects, followed by
a mob of 20 people, looked
for the victim in her Towers

beaﬁng

room.

_However,»Boyd said since
then witnesses in Towers
have said the mob was not 20
people, but around 10.

In addition there are con-
flicting reports of what
weapon was used, and by
whom, in the beating.

“The victim claimed that
Candice [Winn, the arrested
Pitt student] pulled a knife,
although no knife was ever
found,” Boyd said. — .

Officers did find a pair of
scissors, however. They were
found in the purse of Ella
Jones, Candice’s mother,
who was also arrested by
Public Safety.

Jones told The Pitt News
she took the scissors away
from her daughter and put
them in her purse before the
incident at Caleco’s. She also
said the entire incident was
provoked by the victim.

“Candy did not start this
thing,” Jones said. “She does
not have a record at Pitt or

SEAC recycles ”Recyc/e Week” for February

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

Along with aluminum cans and office
paper, Pitt’s Student Environmental
Action Coalition is recycling one of its
educational tactics. - .

This February 6-10, SEAC will hold
its second “Recycle Week” of the school
year. SEAC’s recycling committee is
organizing new events to accompany the
informative tables and large recycling
bins they traditionally put out at the
William Pitt Union during Recycle
Week.

“Our last Recycle Week was incredibly
effective, but I’d like to see-Pitt more

involved in this one,” said SEAC recy-
cling committee member Mike Kaizar.

Kaizar said he hopes to get a larger
number of students involved in Recycle
Weekiby working with other campus
groups like Circle K, Campus Women’s
Organization, Resident Student
Association and the Office of Residence
Life.

A new addition to Recycle Week is the
concept of door-to-door recycling pick-
up in the residence halls. During each
day of Recycle Week, SEAC members
will pick up student’s recyclables in one
of the residence halls.

Now is the time for students to start
saving glass, newspaper, aluminum cans,

office paper, corrugated cardboard and
plastics, Kaizar said.

Recycle week is one of SEAC’s efforts
to educate the campus. Making the stu-
dent body aware of the fact that Pitt does
have a recycling program and encourag-
ing the proper use of it are two of
SEAC’s main goals, according to Kaizar.

SEAC has been working with Pitt’s
housing department to improve the recy-

. cling facilities in the residence halls. As

a result, many of the campus’ recycling
bins are now more clearly marked and
the ones in Holland and Lothrop halls

have signs spray painted above them on

the wall.

KOBE, Japan — A ﬂu epi-

plaguing the refugees of the
Kobe earthquake.

More than 700 hospitals
and medical clinics in the
Kobe region were destroyed
by the Jan. 17 earthquake,
leaving the remaining facili-
ties short of staff and over-
crowded. ,

A senior Kobe city official
said, “The number of evac-

gone up sharply. We think an
epidemic has arrived.”

ANKARA, Turkey — A U.S
airman and his son who were
lost in the wilderness of
Turkey for nine days in sub-

well yesterday at a military

Lt. Col. Mike Couillard, 37,
and his son Matthew, 10,
were found alive on Tuesday

LOS ANGELES —— Judge
Lance Ito stopped live broad-
casts of the O.J. Simpson trial
Tuesday after a camera acci-
dentally showed the face of
an alternate juror for four-

" fifths of a second.

News media lawyers were
to plead with the judge to
reverse the order yesterday
morning. ,-

The judge pulled the plug
just as prosecutors presented
evidence that a trail of blood
led from the crime scene to
the defendant’s home.

Simpson’s attorneys
protested Tuesday’s interrup-
tion because they could not
immediately counter the pros-
ecution’s damning opening
presentation, and claimed that
the delay put Simpson’s right
to a fair trial in jeopardy. —

WASHINGTON —
According to the National
Association of Realtors, U.S.
home sales rose 1.8 percent
in December, a figure much

higher than previously
expected, giving the Federal
Reserve reason to raise inter-
est rates.

The December sales rate
appears to contradict recent
signs that the housing market
is weakening, but the NAR
said it still expects higher
mortgage rates to produce a
decrease in home purchases.

The NAR said 1994 was
the strongest year for home
sales since 1978. — Reuters

WASHINGTON —- Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said that if law-
makers fail to approve a $40
billion aid package for
Mexico, the global trend
toward democracy may be
threatened.

“A reversal of Mexico’s
economic reform and a
spread of Mexico’s financial
difficulties to other emerging
markets could halt or even
reverse the global trend
toward
reform and democratization,”
he said.

The administration has pro-
posed that the U.S. guarantee
up to $40 billion in loans to
Mexico to help restore that
country’s economy. —

“[Housing has] been work-
ing very well with us,”
Kaizar said. “We can meet
and get things done. We are
past the confrontation stage,
and are working together for
education.”

Both SEAC and the hous-
ing office emphasized the
importance of student partici-
pation in the recycling effort.

“We really need 100 per-
cent compliance with this,”
said Director of Housing
Services, Robert Hopkins.
Recyclables and trash must
be kept separate.

“It doesn’t matter if the
rate is 98 percent recyclables
to two percent trash,”
Hopkins said. “Once the load
is contaminated it goes in the
trash.”

SEAC and Housing have
also been working to make
sure that.the trash collectors
are doing their job.

“A lot of times everything
is dumped together (by the
trash collectors),” Kaizar
said. “We talked to trash peo-
ple and they didn’t even
know what to do with recy-
clables.”

Kaizar said he has also

in the Towers’ garage area
filled with trash and haz-
ardous waste like paint cans.

“If the trash collectors
dump everything together all
our effort is wasted,” Kaizar
said. He added that SEAC
may begin recording garbage
truck numbers and license
plate numbers and reporting
trucks that mishandle recy—
clables to the State.

“[Collectors] are telling Pitt
they’re recycling,” Kaizar
said. “If they’re not, they
could face several thousand
dollars in fines and Pitt could
cancel their contract.”

Housing has advised the
trash collectors to follow the
terms of the contract,
Hopkins said.

“There is a financial issue
involved too,” Hopkins said.
“There is a separate fee for
recycling materials. If they
are simply dumped in the
trash, the garbage company
may be making some extra
money,” Hopkins added.

SEAC is currently looking
into other recycling options
for Pitt. Agents of Change,
the non-profit company
Carnegie Mellon University
uses for their recycling, will
take all the recyclables from
Pitt’s residence halls for 30
dollars a month.

Kaizar urged students who
wish to make sure that their
aluminum cans and office
paper are being placed in the
correct bins after they are
taken from the dorm, to put
them in the Towers’ garage
recycling bin themselves.

“If students want recycling,
there will be recycling,”
-Kaizar said. “There is nothing
Pitt can do about it.”

Planning Commission,
Armstrong said.

“The announcement of the
development on the Burger King
site came as a surprise to many
people,” he said. “[It’s] a symbol

ofgood faith.”
Over the next four to six
weeks, the Planning

Commission will consider
whether they will approve this
housing project, as well as the
overall master space plan.

The commission will consider
any community criticism and
input that may arise when the
plans for the new residence hall
become more concrete,
Armstrong said.

“This is a dialogue between
the university, the community
and the city,” Armstrongsaid.
“Everybody gets to say some-
thing.”

In the master space plan, new
housing does not fall under its
plans for the next ﬁve years. But
it does include a promise that Pitt
would present its overall housing

strategy to the planning commis-
sion in six months. The new resi-
dence hall to be built within the
next ﬁve years is part of this over-
all housing strategy. 3
According to Jones, that provi-
sion says to the city: “We promise
that within six months, we’ll have
this plan fleshed out. We’ll be

» able to tell you what we’re going

to do.”

Opinions
Results not contracts

Tuesday night, in a speech which could possibly be of
record length, President Clinton set forth an agenda for the
future. While he was at times a little too conciliatory, never-

theless if he can make the Congress deliver, the next two ’

years of his presidency should outshine the first couple.
Calls for repairing the bonds of community in this country
are long overdue, but the substantive portions of his speech
are what we must watch to see the tangible results. As the
president said, the only time that the people in this country
come together is after a disaster. This apathetic notion is
detrimental_to the country as a whole.

The vow to protect the Americorps program must be kept.
This program allows many young Americans who may not
otherwise get the chance to further their education.
Education is the key to American competitiveness in the
21st century. Not only does the education of Americans
contribute to continued success for the United States, but
the service they provide in return for their education helps
to rebuild the country now. , .

Raising the minimum wage will finally allow all of those
who have taken the low-paying service jobs created by the

612 years of Republican rule at least to survive. This will

also be a boon to all those college students who take mini-
mum wage jobs to help pay their way through college.

Combating the scourge of teen pregnancy is also some-
thing that should not lead to bickering over morality but
concrete solutions to the problem. This issue is a factor in a
number of problems facing this country, including welfare
abuses and inner—city violence.

His call for some kind of health care reform for this year
is also laudable. While universal coverage would be thebest
way to go, President Clinton has to work with what he’s got.

Maintaining the Brady Bill and assault weapons ban are
also necessary. We cannot think to controlviolence when
the criminals are better armed than the police. President
Clinton made a very important point when he said that the
Congress has to be more responsive to the local law
enforcement agencies when they consider methods to con-
trol crime. "

Unlike the Republican response, President Clinton’s
speech focused on bringing America together and solving
the problems we as a nation face. The emphasis on citizen
involvement in government is something that must be car-
ried over into the lives of citizens. America faces a disaster
which will come silently; the country must pull together
now with a willingness to sacrifice and make hard decisions
to avert that disaster. The people of the United States do not
need a covenant or contract. What they need are statesmen

‘ who will serve their interests and provide them with

enlightened leadership when necessary.

Columnist predicts

he 1996 presidential

I campaign. Yes, I know

p it is only January of
1995, but the Republicans
started running for the presi-
dency a few months ago, so I
feel free to start discussing it._
The more I think about it, the
more I realize how wild of a
show it is going to be, and the
chance is there for a real dark-
horse to come through as our

- next president.

But first let’s have a quick
review of the last few years.
In the,1980s everyone either
loved or hated Ronald
Reagan. ‘Unfortunately,
enough people loved him to
see him elected to two terms
of office. Then along came
George Bush (“Saturday
Night Live”’s favorite presi-
dent). Running on the fact
that he was Reagan’s vice-
president, Bush won the 1988
election and at one point was
the most popular president in
history. Then it all came
crashing down and, running
one of the more anemic cam-
paigns in history, Bush was
defeated by Bill Clinton, who
ran a great race.

Unfortunately, Clinton has
not run the presidency as well
as he ran his political cam-
paign. Even though the econ-
omy has improved, unem-
ployment has plummeted and
deficit spending decreased,
the populace cannot identify
with Clinton and generally
doesn’t trust him. He has not
helped matters by acting at
times paranoid and spineless
in the presidency.

To backtrack for a moment,
it must be remembered that
Clinton was hardly swept into
office. He won little more
than 40 percent of the votes,
thanks to H. Ross Perot, who
spiced up the presidential
campaign, receiving about 20
percent of the vote and
paving the way for future
third-party challenges. We
also must remember that

a Congress has been even more

hated than either Clinton or

Bush, which resulted in one
of the most sweeping
Congressional turnarounds in
history this last November.
So now Clinton is hated and
the Republicans are in
Congress, and they will most
likely be hated soon as well.

So what does this mean for
1996? Well, Clinton will
probably be the Democratic
candidate. There have been
calls in the Democratic Party
for him to step aside, but I
find it unlikely that he actual-
ly would. For
Republicans, who knows?
But the primary fight will be
vicious as Republicans fight
for what they view to be the
lame duck presidency of
Clinton. But with all the
attention the Republicans
have received lately, the pri-
mary battle will likely be one
of big names.

The entire nation knows
who Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole, former Vice
President Dan Quayle and
Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich are, and other big
names such as Sen. Phil
Gramm and Colin Powell (if
he even is a Republican) are
well known as well. If these
big names are in the pri-
maries, it will be difficult for
a lesser known and more
moderate Republican to break
through, get his name known
and receive the nomination.
This means that the
Republican presidential can-
didate will very likely be a
member of the far right.

So consider the following
scenario: President Clinton is
still unpopular and Congress
remains unpopular, and there-
by the Republicans lose
favor. A‘ matchup between
Clinton and a far right wing
Republican from Congress is
hardly an appealing choice
for the American people.
When has the time been more
ripe for a third-party candi-
date?

Ross Perot broke the ice in
1992, so a third-party candi-

the.

interesting race

date in ‘1996 would probably
not be viewed with quite the
same skepticism as Perot
was. Also, if this third-party
candidate was moderate, he
could easily draw votes from
moderate Republicans and
moderate and conservative
Democrats. Sounds simple.
Of course the big problem is
who could do it? As far as
I’m concerned, Perot has no
hope for ‘96. I would be
shocked if people seriously
considered him after the 1992
campaign and his utter failure
attempting to rally the people
against NAFTA. But if anoth-
er rich and fairly well-known
person could jump out of the
woodwork, they might actual-

-ly have a chance of winning
in 1996. Perhaps even a mod-_

erate Republican who split
off from the far right could
win without the Republican
nomination.

Of course I don’t expect a
third-party candidate to actu-
ally win — it is merely a
viable possibility. But beyond
those considerations, any-
thing can still happen

between now and November .

o.f 1996. Don’t countout
Clinton. A moderate
Republican would probably
kill him, but if he faced a
member of- the radical right as
I think is likely, hemay still
have a chance at pulling off

the victory in 1996. Anyway,‘

by the time the Republicans
get done mauling each other
in the primaries, they may
have done more damage to
themselves than Clinton
could ever do.

All in all, 1996 promises to
be an exciting year and will
probably be the biggest and
longest campaign in the his-
tory of the American presi-
dency.

For Hurley,
i r '5 sweet
redemption

, against Piﬂ

t took two

years, but

much-
maligned
Danny
Hurley got
his revenge
on the Pitt
Panthers and
the
Fitzgerald
Field House
last night.

“I just kept thinking about
what happened two years ago
and knew I couldn’t let it
happen again,” Hurley said
last night, minutes after sink-
ing the shot which lifted the
Seton Hall squad to a 13-5
record, 4-4 in the Big East.

With less than 30 seconds
left, the situation was nearly
identical to the 1993 version‘
of Pitt-Seton Hall at
Fitzgerald in which Pitt upset
the Pirates, ranked sixth in
the country at the time. The
Pirates trailed the Panthers by
one, and Hurley’s missed free
throw‘ led to Garrick Thomas’
three—pointer which sent the
Field House into a frenzied
riot.

Hurley missed a free throw
in the same fashion last night,
but this time Seton Hall took
the ball right back after a Pitt
double-dribble and Hurley
could think of nothing but
redemption.

“That [‘93] game was one
of my worst,” Hurley said. “I
knew how sweet it would be
to win it here — so Ijust
sacked up and made it.”

Perhaps the most ironic
point about Hurley’s shot is
that nobody thought he would
take it. He had just missed a
crucial free throw after play-
ing, by his own admission, a
very poor game. And most
importantly, he snubbed a
clear path to pass to 23-point
scorer Adrian Giffin.

“When the set play broke
down, I wanted to take that
last shot no matter what. I
felt like I could beat my man
 whoever they put on me,”
Hurley said. “[The shot]
gives me a good feeling
about a game where I didn’t
perform well.”

A lackluster performance
indeed. But Seton Hall head
coach George Blaney didn’t
care.

“I love players who are
willing to take it both ways,”
Blaney said. “If he makes it
he’s the hero, if he misses,
it’s on his shoulders.”

High praise for a player
who barely looked interested
in the game until he had the

Seton Hall upends

By Brett Fondrk
Senior Staff Writer

It was a game that no one
wanted to win, or maybe no
one deserved to. The high-
lights included bumbled pass-
es, blatant lane violations,
poor decisions and a plethora
of fouls. And to no one’s sur-
prise, this comedy of errors
between Seton Hall and Pitt
was decided on a blown play.

Pirate point guard Danny
Hurley’s running jump shot
down the middle from 12 feet

out with 17
ticks left
on the
c l o c k
proved to
be the
game win-
ner, as the Panthers fell 72-70.

“We had a play set out of
bounds and didn’t work,”
Seton Hall coach George
Blaney said.

Blaney didn’t elaborate on
what was supposed to happen,
he had Hurley to answer for
him.

“When the set play broke
down, I wanted to take that
last shot no matter what,”
Hurley said. “I knew that I
could beat my man off the
dribble.” '

He did just that. The runner
under pressure was nothing
but net. It was surprising that
Hurley had the confidence
considering that he was 2 for
12 from the field preceding
that critical bucket.

“That’s what I love about
him,” Blaney said. “He’s not
afraid to take a big shot.”

But despite Hurley’s last-

Men's,women's swim teams trounce WVU

By Jim Wheeler  
For The Pitt News

When West Virginia
arrived at Trees Pool last
night they had no idea they
would be punished by the
Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team by 80 points.
The final score was 161.5-
81.5.

Coach Chuck Knoles’
modest
s m i l e
showed
t h e
pride of
_ _ t h e
WWMW47’ e n t i r e
e 1 team.

“We’re still not very
sharp because we won’t
start resting till next week,”
Knoles said.

“This is always a fun
meet with WVU. They’re
going to be in the Big East
next year. It is a positive
move for the Big East. Our
divers are looking very
good for this time of the
year”

 

Senior Matt Brady took
first in both the 200-
meter butterfly and 200-
meter freestyle with
times of 1:55.21 and
1:43.94.

“Today has been a good
meet for everyone to shine.
It has provided the team
with an opportunity to
allow all swimmers to com-
pete,” said Brady.

Pitt swimmers and divers
took first place 10 times
including sophomore John
Soulakis’ firsts in 3- and 1-
meter diving.

“I thought the team did
great overall. I was pleased
with my performance and
the diving team’s perfor-
mance. I thought we did a
good job,” said Soulakis.

Junior Sami Vartiainen
also had an impressive per-
formance, finishing first in
the l00—meter free with a
time of 47.75. Freshman
teammate Eric Stefanski
finished one-tenth of a sec-
ond behind him for second

The Pitt women’s swim
team won its fourth meet of
the season yesterday with a
168-75 victory over the
Mountaineers of West
Virginia at Trees Pool.

The Panthers have seven
losses on the season, but
this does not bother head
coach Marian Cassidy-
Kean.

“I’m very pleased with
our performance,” said
Kean. “The girls swam
really well. It was really
nice to see the team do so
well at home.

“Our schedule is very
difficult. We could
make our schedule a little
easier to help our win-loss
record look better, but that
would not help us at all.
Our goal is to get better
every meet. I feel that they
are.”

Freshman standout Erin
Bissell continued her win-
ning ways. She won the

200-meter breaststroke
with a time of 2:27.41. She
was also part of the 200
medley relay which came
in third with a time of
1:54.07. The winner of the
event was Pitt’s team of

Christy Knobloch, Jill
Fletcher, Isabel Dejo and
senior captain Vicki

Geubtner, with a time of
1:51.41.

Other first-place winning
performances were turned
in by freshman Kim Billen
in the 50—meter freestyle,
junior Jill Fletcher in
the 200 individual medley,
junior Jenny Doran in
the 200 butterfly and fresh-
man Isabel Dejo in the
100 free. The team of
junior Chrissy DeLeonardo
and freshman Megan
McNallen were also victo-
rious in the 200 freestyle
medley;

Freshman Leslie Becki
improved her performance.
She finished third in the

200 individual medle .

Richard Linklater is the go-
between uniting the slackers and
the non-slackers. in his new film
Before Sunrise, he entertains an

eccentric love between an
American traveler and a French
student in an especially non-
Linklater environment, Vienna.

Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke,
overcomes his ‘boy meets girl’ jit-
ters and creatively suggests to
Celine that she postpone her
return home and accompany him
for an 14-hour adventure through
the city. While drinking German
beer, they recycle their dreams
and hopes, tread on brittle events
and they throw off inhibitions with
the enthusiasm of a Madonna-
style truth or dare.

Slacker, Richard Linklater’s
debut film, traced the lives of
Texas’ twenty-nothings and estab-
lished a lo-fi genre of films.
Following the success of Slacker,
film companies petitioned
Linklater’s seemingly untrained tal-
ent. Dazed and Confused modeled
the slacker generation growing in
the ‘70s, where Kiss touched their
lips and pot touched their minds.
Linklater’s audience was enter-
tained by a mob of charismatic
characters, Pap Smear Pimp and
Slater, but in his lastest feature, he
explores a different idea: an
intense focus relationship, where
hearts can be broken.

Recent Reality Bites slacker-boy
and former CMU student Ethan
Hawke stars as Jesse. ‘‘I loved
Slacker and Dazed and Confused.
That’s why I’m doing Before

Sunrise,” stated Hawke. His moti- -

vation for working with Linklater
was mutual. “Ethan was less sure
of the part, asked lots of questions
and saw it as a huge almost
impossible challenge. it scared
him, just like it scared me,” the
director said.

The strangeness came from the
intense dialogue of the movie. The
actor stated, ‘‘When I saw how
much dialogue there was in Before
Sunrise I couldn’t believe it. It was
wonderful!” With a background in
the theater, Ethan’s world spon-
sors language more than lyrics

and New York’s Broadway would '

not have the burst of musical
showcases.

His acting career began at
Princeton’s distinguished McCarter
Theater and later continued in
England with British. Theater
Association and briefly at Carnegie
Mellon University.

Although not having such a for-
mal training in theater, Julie Delpy
has evidently been on a popularity
trip. She has starred in The Three
Musketeers, Krysztof Kieslowski’s
White, and Killing Zoe. Linklater’s
observation was a birth of the true,
“l wanted someone intense, deep
and mysterious, and Julie Delpy is
certainly all those things and
more.”

Delpy’s birthright is from
France, but she certainly caught
the eyes of American audience but
her extra exposure is not that per-
sonal for her. Her satisfaction
would come from introducing
unnamed directors that don't have
government green to break the
doors of Hollywood. Not a typical
response from an upcoming
actress, however she isn't settled
on acting yet. Graduating first from
New York University in directing,
she is working on her own film,
“Blah Blah Blah.”

But, what would happen if Before

  

 

Sunrise’s teen fluff characters
would go one-on-one in a fight-
to-the-death showdown. Las
Vegas wouId'go crazy.

Say Anything v.. Before Sunrise
(Odds: Say Anything)

Lloyd knows kickboxing! This
is a plus. Although Jesse never
demonstrated any moving
anger, he wears Chuck Taylor’s
sneakers and probably has a
heavy Fender guitar at home
ready to wield as a weapon.
Celine is French; they’re not
fighters, they’re lovers. Diane is
slightly stressed out because
her father is jail, another plus.

Say Anything would KO
Before Sunrise in the first
round, Lloyd and Diane have
too much angst to build on. A
definite ass-kicking.

Pretty In Pink vs. Before
Sunrise (Odds: Before Sunrise)

Blain is a Republican (i.e.
wimp), Jesse is liberal (i.e tutf
guy), this equals one-punch
and its over. Jesse can be
ecstatic. Andy is a girl from the
tuff neighborhood, swift and
deadly. This is a draw, maybe a
rematch can settle the dispute.

ambiance, perhaps a movie,
Before Sunrise, might be the
perfect flick. The movie talents
big star Ethan Hawke as Jesse,
an American visiting Europe,
and Julie Delpy as Celine, a
French student returning home.

They meet on the Eurorail,
where they have been staring
out the window contemplating
the thoughts of being closer to
home. Time passes better
when lips are gabbing and ears
are listening. They click. He
smiles and she smiles.

Jesse goes for lust or bust
when he proposes to her a time
of her life. But for Celine it's a
“what if?" situation. She accepts
his offer and they continue their
friendship in Vienna.

Perhaps one of the funniest
scenes in the movie exposes
an American’s lack of interna-
tional etiquette. Jesse and
Celine are wandering the city
where they have no plans, no
clue,and they come across a
pair of Germans who are mind-
ing their own business. Jesse
asks, “Do you speak English?”
One responds, “Do you speak
German?” Them stupid
Americans.

The scenery becomes a third
character due to its alien quali-
ty. The couple converse in
alleys, Coffeehouses, in front of
canals and take midnight strolls
in the park. Linklater points out,
‘‘I saw an attitude in Vienna I
tried to work into certain
scenes. The Austrian seemed
looser and with more of a sense
of humor than in certain other
European cities we were con-
sidering.”

A cute-as-cute-gets scene
takes place in a record store.
The two are in a listening booth.
A records plays, Jesse stares at
Celine, emotionally arguing for
a kiss. Celine, conscious of his
stare, refuses to look over. The
roles reverse, Celine stares and

3

Jesse looks away.

The movie’s dialogue format
presses the actors to become
their characters. With long
takes and long conversation,
Delpy said you really stop act-
ing and just do it. Also the audi-
ence can be more in tuned with
the film, she said.

Lately there has been a surge
of dumb movies, where both
audience and characters relax
their grey matter. Forrest Gump
has set a precedent for films -
be simple, win a Golden Globe
Globe.

The conversations of Jesse
and Celine bring the audience
closer. Hawke said, “|ntimacy is
something people struggle with
yet, it seems far easier with a
stranger sometimes.”

Before Sunrise is certainly a
‘90s version of a few John
Hughes’ films, they attract the
same audience. Whereas a
Hughes’ ending usually encom-
passes Pollyannic naivete,
Linklater leaves an unresolved
ending. What would Jesse and
Celine do?

Before Sunrise starts Friday
Jan. 27 at local cineplexes.

The Last Seduction
Written by Steve Barancik
Directed by John Dahl
Starring Linda Fiorentino,
Peter Berg and Bill ‘Pullman

 

Being the lone girl in the the-
ater watching John Dahl’s third
movie, Th‘e'Last- Seduction,
gave me some sort of power
boost. As I clenched my fists
and bit my lower lip, I watched
the men around me cross their
legs. As I jumped up and
screamed, “Go my fellow sister!
Knock this man down another
peg from his patriarchal high
horse," the men, well, they 
OK, they didn’t do anything.
Actually, nothing happened that
way. But watching Linda
Fiorentino’s character, Bridget
(who calls herself Wendy), dom-

tantly, she does not come off as
manly, and, if you can believe it,

screaming, “Whore! You shall

Disregarding the commonly
believed bitch facade of strong
women-, Bridget’s energy is
overwhelming. She moves from
situation to situation, from man
to man, appearing sincere, but
making it all part of her quest for
paradise. The schemer con-
vinces her husband (Bill
Pullman) to go through with
stage one of the plan, the very
profitable drug deal, which
would enable them (or should I
say her) to live pretty well for
awhile. After the hubby is used
for stage one, the cold-hearted

After leaving with the loot,
brawny Bridget ends up in the
small town of Beston, where
everyone is friendly, courteous
and boring —— to her and me.
Whether in impersonal New
York (where her crooked lawyer,
played by J.T. Walsh, resides to
answer legal questions) or in

of the few people from Beston
who actually ventured to and
lived in a bigger city: Buffalo.
With that big city experience
under his belt (and not a very
pleasurable one, at that) he
feels that he has that certain
something that makes him bet-
ter than Beston. Wendy is the
ultimate challenge for Mike, and
his desire to feel just as big as
this brash city babe becomes
his own quest. (The “you’ll
always be bigger than me,
Wendy” complex follows the
Beston, Home of the Bulldogs-
Boy throughout the entire
movie.)

For Bridget, Swale does have
a much bigger role than just a

vent for carnal pleasures, but he ~-

is too trusting and small town to
realize it. Our leading lady
knows this and plays on it. The
sensitive Mike needs more: he
needs love, a commitment. He
needs to be held. Yeah, right.
But,don’t start wiping your eyes
for the poor guy yet; ol’ Mikey
has some secrets of his own.

Bridget simply reminds every-

one, men and women alike, of
the obvious: do everything you
can to get what you want.
Nobody needs the bullshit
involved with rules and regula-
tions. lt’s all rooted in “desire,

When dance legend Arthur
Mitchell learned of the assasina-
tion of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
he made a persona|,commitment
to establish a dance community
where the dreams of Dr. King
could live on.

Mitchell chose to center his
new community in Harlem,
where he could offer economi-
cally disadvantaged children an
opportunity to excel in dance art.

Twenty-six years later, The
Dance Theatre of Harlem still
prides itself on showcasing its
cultural roots, and is considered
one of the world’s top ballet
companies. internationally
known for strong technique and
athleticism, the DTH has set
numerous box office and atten-
dance records.

With over 50 dancers and a
repertoire of more than 75
works, the company has been a
stand-out in its own right, win-
ning acclaim for both an individ-
ual dance style and unconven-
tional ballet methods.

The Dance Theatre of Harlem
will be in Pittsburgh this week-

end to perform three of their
most popular works: Alvin Ailey’s
The Fiiver, Tetley’s Dialogues
and Geoffrey Ho|der’s Dougla.

The latter dance is an exotic
look into the lives of the Dougla
people as they unite with an
Indian tribe by way of marriage.
The cultural and traditional
changes that follow highlight the
conclusion of this powerful
dance. ‘

The DTH has broken down
many of the pristine ballet
stereotypes and introduced a
new form of the classical style
that blurrs the distinction
between modern dance and bal-
let. The theatre has a wide
range of choreographic versatili-
ty which includes the ability to be
both graceful and strong at
once.

The Dance Theatre of Harlem
performs Friday and Saturday,
January 27 and 28, 8 p.m., at
the Benedum Center.

Tickets are avalib/e at the
Benedum Box Office or by call-
ing 456-6666.

So, we’ e back in the base-
ment of the Tower of Love to
witness Us —-— a genre of theatre
known as the Theatre of
Cruelty.

Theatre of Cruelty goes far
beyond invading your personal
space as audience members, it
invades your personal state of
consciousness. We are the
show, not the actors, which is
the point of this genre of theatre.

Peter Handke, rubberband
man to the Theatre of Cruelty,
wrote a play entitled “Offending
the Audience” which may give
you some idea of what I’m jab-
bering about:

“Because we speak to you,
you can become conscious of
yourself. Because we speak to
you, your self-awareness
increases. You are now aware
of your presence. You know that
it is your time that you are
spending here. You are the
topic. You tie the knot. You are
the center. You were a sight to

   

   

    

have seen, you ass—kissers.”

Us is a memory play which
means that almost the whole
thing is a character’s dreams. If
we survive all the violence and
ADULT situations there is a
message to the play:

“Looking at things inside our-
selves that we normally don't
like to look at and using them to
empower ourselves,” pitched
director Tim Golebiewski.

Eeewl They also have a blow-
up doll named, Bridgette, but
she only has a small role. I think
she gets beat up a couple of
times. Bridgette makes the cast
a happy seven. Why? Seriously,
it sounds like it’s going to be a
pretty loopy trip, big doggies.

US runs from 1/26 to 1/28 at
8 p.m. in B-70. Saturday has
two, two, two shows so call the

Women's
hoops takes
Hoyas on

the road,

73-60

Behind Melissa Thompson's
game-high 20 points, the Lady
Panthers stole one on the road
against Georgetown, winning
70-63 last night.

Sixteen of Thompson's points
came in the second half, helping
the Lady Panthers overcome a
four point deficit at the break,
31-27.

Pitt tied the game on
Thompson's jumper at the 10:54
mark in the second half and
never looked back.

After that, the Lady Panthers
went on a 9-2 run, capped off
by a Latia Howard free throw
split, which proved unsur-
mountable for the Lady Hoyas.

Four Pitt players tallied dou-
ble figures. Freshman center
Howard scored 15 points and
grabbed a game-high eight
rebounds.

Stephanie Petho added 12
points and co-captain Jenine
Joyce punched in 10, despite
shooting 2—for—l2 from the ﬁeld.
Pitt raised its record to 12-5 and
6-3 in the Big East.

“With this meet, we are
very excited about how
we did. A lot of us are
getting ready for the Big
East Championships,” said
Becki.

The diving team contin-
ued its dominance. The
team dove to victory in
both 1- and 3-meter com-
petitions. In the 1-meter
event, the Panthers fin-
ished one, two, three and
four. I

The divers were,
in order of finish -
Sunday Lewandowski,

Buffy Smith, Kara
Sixbury and Amy
Spinnenweber.

On the 3-meter board,
the results were similar.
Lewandowski, Sixbury
and Spinnenweber took
one, two and three respec-
tively.

“Our diving is really
strong,” said Kean. “They
have been the mainstay of
our team. They always do
well.”

The team travels to its
conference foe Villanova
this Saturday.

“Our main team goal is
to get ready for the Big

Kean. _

second heroics, Pitt still had a
chance to win in the final sec-
onds.

Pitt drove the ball down the
court and called a time out.
With two seconds left,
Orlando"Antigua was set to
inbound the ball under the
Seton Hall bucket, but as has
been the case all year, Pitt
failed to execute.

The inbounds pass went to
Garrick Thomas, who had the
ball stripped from his grasp.
As both teams scrambled for
the loose ball, time ran out on
the Panthers.

“Garrick was open and they
just knocked it away,” Antigua
said. “It’s very disappointing.”

But the blame can’t be
placed entirely on Thomas.
This loss was clearly a team
effort. Pitt turned the ball over
22 times, allowed 19 offensive
rebounds and generally played
one of its sloppiest games of
the season.

“I thought that our effort
and focus tonight were not
very good,” head coach Ralph
Willard said. “Obviously to
win close games you have to

chance to be a hero. He had
14 points but was beating
Pitt mostly at the free throw
line. He was lucky to have
made 3 of his 12 attempts
from the field and seemed to
be helping Pitt with his 5
turnovers and lackadaisical
effort through the majority
of the game. 2

But in the end Hurley was
not to be denied. After hit-
ting his shot, he knew Pitt
still had good opportunity to
win the game.

“And all I could think
about was getting to Garrick
Thomas, he killed us before
and I was scared to death it
would happen again.”

After a Pitt bobble, Hurley
eventually came away with
the ball and whipped it into
the air as time expired, mak-
ing sure to point at the crowd
and slap the Pitt Panther
mascot on the way out.

quickly turned somber, how-
ever, when asked about quit-
ting last season after playing
in two games.

“It’s really hard to travel to
all of these arenas and be
constantly harassed and
abused if you’re

anything but your best,”
Hurley said of the pressure
of being the little brother to
famed Duke star and current
NBA player Bobby Hurley.

“I take a lot of ammu-
nition and its not easy. You,
just have to step back

and ask yourself if its real-
ly worth it.”

And Fitzgerald
Field House was, accord-

ing to Hurley, one

of the most intimidating
places in which he’s
played.

“This was one of the
worst places to play,”
Hurley said. “I remember
them chanting ‘Hurley’s a
fag’ and whatever else the
whole time. Tonight [the
crowd] wasn’t into it at all, it
was weird.”

More confidently, Hurley
said he’s glad to have left “a
new mark on the Field
House” and looks forward to
coming back.

Be careful Danny, you still
have two more trips here and
next time we won’t let you
off so easily.

Matt Groff is a senior staﬂ
writer for The Pitt News.

make big plays at both ends of
the court.”

Pitt failed, at both ends.

Defensively, and rebounding
was a glaring statistic. The
Pirates repeatedly misfired
from beyond the three-point
line, but time and time again
got second and third chances
as they gathered in the miss.

“They’re shooting 3 for 19
from three and getting 19
offensive rebounds,” Willard
said. “They probably got half
of those from missed three’s.
That was one of the determin-
ing factors in the game.”

The Panthers faired no bet-
ter when they had the ball,
especially in the opening half
as they shot a frigid 38 percent
from the field. 0

“This was one of our poor-
est games offensively,”
Willard said. “The game is
about which team can exe-
cute.”

Pitt had trouble executing
the entire game, especially in
the first half when they only
managed to put 31 points on
the board. But despite the lack
of offensive punch, the
Panthers found themselves

only down three going into the
locker room. They were kept
close by the streaky shooting
of Thomas, who was four of
six for nine points.

Pitt roared out of the gates
in the second half and took the
lead on consecutive threes by
Anitgua and Jason Maile.

The Panthers had leads as
high as seven as the game see-
sawed back and forth as the
teams bumbled their way all
over the court.

The Pirates kept Pitt within
striking distance as they rode
the hot hand of forward
Adrian Griffin. The 6-foot-5
junior finished the game with
23 points, 15 of which came in
the second half.

“We made some big plays
down the stretch,” Blaney
said. “It’s a win on the road
which is hard to come by,
especially in this league.”

Wins have been hard to
come by for Pitt this year,
home or away. This was just
another tough loss in a season
of heartbreaks.

“We had the game won,”
Andre Alridge said. “But it
just slipped away, again.”
