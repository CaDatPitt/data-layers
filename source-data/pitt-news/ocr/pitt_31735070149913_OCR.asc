Pitt defines
gendered
facilities

policy  

By Em Maier and Andrew Shull
The Pitt News Staﬂ”

Contrary to- the wishes of a Uni-
versity advisory body, Pitt’s.trans—
gender students will haveto use

the bathroom facilities that cor-

Eespond to the one on their birth
certiﬁcates, rather than the one
they identify with.

A University representative de-
livered news of the new standard
concerning transgender students
to Pitt’s Anti-Discriminatory Poli-
cies Committee Tuesday.

Last month, the ADP com—
mittee, one of the standing com:
mittees of the University Senate,
unanimously passed a resolution
that would allow students to use
bathrooms allocated to the gender
they identify with, not their natal
sex. The ADP committee does not
make policy, but instead advises

the University Senate. The com— A

mittee includes|Pitt faculty, staff
and two Pitt students who do not
have voting power: Board mem-

ber Julie Hallinan and Rainbow _

Alliance President Tricia‘Dough—

erty.

But at Tuesday’s meeting, an I

unidentiﬁed University represen-

_tative said that students would be

forced to use gendered facilities

‘according to the sex listed on their

birth certiﬁcates.

The person said in the meeting
she represented both Pitt’s office
of the General Counsel and Oﬂice
of Human Resources.

In a statement signed by Jane
Feuer, ADP committee chair-
woman; Deborah Brake, a past
chairwoman; Bruce Venarde, an
elected member, and Mark Lynn
Anderson, committee secretary,
the committee members said that
Tuesday was the ﬁrst time they had
heard of the University’s stance on
“sex-separate facilities.”

“This came as a shock to us,

Bollegekepuhlieans host Senate candidate  

By Pat McAteer
Staﬂ’ Writer

High taxes and burdensome regula-
tions have stiﬂed small business in
the United States, a Pennsylvania
candidate for the U.S. Senate. told
a group of about 25 Pitt College Re—
publicans Tuesday night.

“ Steve Welch, a Republican en-
dorsed by the PittiCo1lege Repub-
licans for his party’s nomination to
run against incumbent Democratic
Sen. Bob Casey, talked to students
at David Lawrence Hall about his

background in business, his strict
adherence to ﬁscal conservatism
and the failure of education in the
country. . T 

Welch faces ﬁve other Republi-
can candidates —- David Christian,
a public servant, pharmacist John
Kensinger, former state Rep. Sam
Rohrer, Cumberland County lawyer
Marc Scaringi and businessman
Tom Smith. A '

Welch said the regulations
placed on businesses make it a
“daunting task” for businesses to
begin in the country and place large

corporations at an advantage.

’ “We’ve seen a massive expan-
sion of government thathurts
the people it’s meant to protect,”
Welch said in regard to small busi-

- I'l€SS€S.

Nationally, Welch said the Re-
publican party must take a more re—
alistic approach based on the eco-
nomic realities of the countrypand
stop focusing on social issues."\\

But Welch did quickly touch of? 

abortion during his speech.

“I’m probably pro—life,” he said.
“There’s a lot of things in my life
that reinforce that view.” v

Continuingpon the economic

theme, Welch'said Obama’s health
care plan eliminates the opportuni_—

. ty for competition between health

care companies for lower prices. He
said he believes the lack of competi-
tion drives prices up.

. ' Welch said once again that Re-
publicans ignore the health care ar-
gument and instead focus on issues
like defunding contraception.

“It really demonstrates that

Obamacare is a top-down approach _
"to the health care system where the

government has too much control,”
Welch said.

Collegiate Readership locked drop boxes planned for April

By Michael Ringling
Staﬁ'Wri ter

Pitt’s Student Government Board planned
to have The New York Times and USA
Today return to campus in locked drop
boxes.

But the 300 copies of each newspa-

:per came last week without the added

security. _

At Tuesday night’s SGB meeting,
Board member Julie Hallinan said that
the locked drop boxes will arrive in April.
The Board also explained to the 10 or so
people who attended the meeting why the
copies ofthe newspapers were available
without the locked drop boxes.

In December, the Board halted the
Collegiate Readership Program because
the copies of The New York Times and

,USA Today were unsecured, allowing
- those who do not pay the program-fund-

ing Student Activities Fee to easily pick
up copies on campus. The Board voted
to wait until after Spring Break to bring
back the newspapers because it wanted
to make sure the papers were secured
with locked card—swipe boxes that stu-
dents would be able to open with their
Pitt IDs. _ .

Associate Dean and Director "of Stu-
dent Life Kenyon Bonner said that the
swipe boxes hadn’t arrived by" the time
theppapers returned because the boxes
needed to be manufactured. Bonner said
the delays also stemmed from testing the
hardware to make sure it would read Pitt
IDs. The boxes were ordered around the
time of SG'B’s decision to reinstate the
program in January. .

Hallinan said the lack of locked drop
boxes was due to a failure to turn in pa-
perwork on time.

She added that she wanted to look
into sources to pay for the $33,600

out of the $80-per-semester fee each
undergraduate non-College of General
Studies student pays into the Student
Activities Fund. '

“I don’t want it to be a Board—to-Board
thing,” Hallinan said, referring to her de-
sire to ﬁnd a more stable way of funding
the program rather than forcing future
Boards to make the decision.”

Board President James Landreneau
said on Monday that the contract for the
program will last until December 2012.
He said he didn’t feel comfortable sign-
ing the contract for two years because
he did not know how the reception of
the papers would change once they were
secured. ' . ' .

He said that he wants to have a strong
transition with next.year’s Board and
make surethat the program has a strong
reception after the implementation of
the swipe boxes.’ '

“I don’t think the Board should be
set on this as a complete success,” Lan-
dreneau said. “I want to make sure that
we have some stability for this proj-
ect.” _ '

In other news, members of the,'Board

Welch also said environmental regula-
tions continue to drive up “input costs” for
energy companies, forcing U.S. reliance on
foreignicountries. He added that while the
companies might have an environmental
impact, the market will eventually solve such
problems.

Calling himself a strong supporter of edu-
cation, Welch said centralization of education
in the country has reduced its quality across
the board. He said the creativity ofindividual
states is reflected in its students and that the
ingenuity of Americans sets them apart from
other nations. .

“If you give me any problem in the world, I
can tell you it’s because of education,” Welch
said. “If anything good happens in the world,
I’ll tell you it’s because of education.”

In order to demonstrate what he meant

by stating that the market resolves environ— ,

mental impacts, Welch usedthe example of
the situation in which the Cuyahoga River
in Cleveland caught ﬁre in 1969. Welch said
companies didn’t stop producing plastic;
they simply made the process more envi-
ronmentally friendly.

“There will be an impact, but as long as
we have strong economic growth in society,

we’ll solve it,” Welch said.

Welch said his dedication to deregula-
tion comes from his background in business.
He said that he opened his ﬁrst engineering
ﬁrm, Mitos, at the age of 23 and soon there-
after opened a capital’ ﬁrm called Dreamlt
Ventures. -

. John Sutter, Welch’s Press secretary, said
in an email that Welch appreciated the en-
dorsement of the Pitt College Republicans
and that their support was crucial for the

' candidate.

“Since Steve has earned the endorsement
of the Pitt College Republicans, he is pleased
to speak at their meeting and introduce him-
self to their members and any other inter-
ested students,” Sutter said. “Their support is

critical in helping to get college—age students V P

to the polls and support Steve.”

Sutter also said Welch’s background in
business “strongly resonates with voters
across the Commonwealth.”

Casey Rankin, president of the Pitt*Col—
lege Republicans, said Welch’s dedication
to economic conservatism earned him the
endorsement of the College Republicans.

“We feel he is the best candidate by far to
beat Bob Casey,” Rankin said. ’

Rankin said the College Republicans plan
to make phone calls, knock on doors and
spread Welch’s message to other Pitt students
and the community. I

has been, at least for restroom use (not
showers or housing) to allow students to
use the restroom that matches their lived
gender identity, as long as there is some
documentation from a health provider
(conﬁrming that the student identiﬁes as

a person of that gender),” the statement

said.

Carol Mohamed, director of Pitt’s Oﬂice
of Aﬂirmative Action, Diversity and Inclu-
sion, declined to comment on the issue.

The Office of the University Counsel
did not respond to multiple requests for
comment.

Dougheity said the new policy surprised
her after the work the committee had done
on the proposed policy.

“The general reaction [at the meeting]
was horriﬁed. There is an obvious consensus
that this is ridiculous, that this wasn’t OK,
and people were really upset, and they were
working to change it,” Dougherty said.

Alice Haas, a junior transgender stu-
dent, also didn’t react positively to Pitt’s
gendered-facility policy. Haas identiﬁes
as a female.

“I ﬁnd it absolutely barbaric and ap-
palling that the University of Pittsburgh
requires forced castration in order for me
to be considered female, especially when
my driver’s license and passport both state
otherwise,” Haas said. “It is in no way just

v

or appropriate to force me to provide in-
formation on my genitals or my birth cer-
tiﬁcate.”

Anderson said in an email that he was
disappointed at the announcement.

“Our committee has been working on
transgender issues for over a year, almost
two  and the announcement this morning
of this ‘standard’ was simply devastating
to many members of our committee,” he
said. I

Dougherty said that this standard pres-
ents a number of issues for transgender
students.

---For one, to change one’s sex on a birth
certiﬁcate, Dougherty said, an individual

V must get sex reassignment surgery, which
‘ she said was generally “prohibitively ex-
pensive” for college students, as well as a

lengthy undertaking.

The website for Aetna Insurance stated
that the process to go through gender reas-
signment surgery takes at least 12 months.
It involves hormone therapies, multiple
screenings and ﬁnally surgery, according
to the website.

Dougherty said that, generally, the ﬁrst
step for transgender persons with their na-
tal sex listed on their birth certiﬁcates is to
seek out gender-neutral bathrooms.

But these are less common than gen-
dered bathrooms, and no directory exists
as to where these facilities are located on
campus. Currently, Pitt’s gender-neutral
bathrooms exist in a number of locations,
including on the top ﬂoor the Cathedral of

local elected officiaL .

Learning and in Market Central.

Doughe_rty said that transgender indi-
viduals entering a gendered facility for their
natal sex could also face harassment.

“A gender-neutral bathroom is much saf-
er,” she said. “I would fear being harassed. I
would say that I hope there really wouldn’t
be a threat, but I have to acknowledge tha
there would be a safety risk.” ‘

Dougherty said that, formerly, if a trans-
gender student was confronted in a bath-
room of the gender they identify with, the

student could send the person who con— .

fronted him or her to the afﬁrmative ac-
tion ofﬁce. g ' - '

But given the new standard clariﬁed
before the ADP committee today, that is
no longer the case. '

V, Richard White, chairman of the Student
Government Board’s Transportation and
Safety Committee, said that he spoke with
Dougherty after the meeting and plans to
have his committee address the clariﬁed
standard. i .

White said that forcing students to use
bathroom facilities of their natal gender
“could expose them to potential physical
or verbal abuse.” ,

However, White said that it was too early _
to discuss what action his committee will
take. .

The U-.S. Department ofJustice’s statis-
tics on hate crimes include those associ-
ated with sexual orientation but not gender °
identity. The Department ofjustice did not
return multiple requests for comment.

The issue came up three different times
during Tuesday night’s Student Government
Board meeting. 1

Board memberjulie Hallinan explained
the clariﬁed policy during her address to
the Board, explaining it as “kind of a big
thing.”

. Board member Zoe Samudzi also com-
mended Hallinan’s and Dougherty’s efforts
to reverse the policy during her address to
the Board. She further commented follow-
ing the meeting.

“It might be a generation divide,” she
said. “But the administration needs to

. understandthat your sex is not your gen-

der.” 4 .
' Dougherty addressed the policy as well
during the open-ﬂoor segment of the meet-

ing. She took the time to advertise an event '

the Rainbow Alliance will hold on Thursday.
The club plans to host a seminar detailing

how Pitt’s policies will apply to housing,

bathrooms and other facilities, The meeting
will explain what has changed concerning
Pitt’s transgender policy and what avenues
are available. _

I The _club also plans on creating petitions
and letters to send to the administration in
the hope of informing the University of its
community’s concerns. .

“There are a lot of students who are
walking around thinking they’re protected,
and they were [Monday], and now they’re
not. It’s important to educate [them] what
their rights are and what they aren’t,”
Dougherty said. I.

share. Therequest was postponed be-

cause no one from the club attended the

meeting.

A The NORML club requested $3,800

to bring aqspeaker to campus. The Board

approved the request in full.

Pitt Outdoors Club requested $1,063
for a trip to Seneca Rocks. The Alloca-
tioris Committee recommended the Board
approve $1,033 and deny $30 for fire-
wood. The Board approved the request in
full, after Louderback moved to include

_the $30.

The Pitt Men’s Ultimate‘ Frisbee Club -

requested $3,160.36 to participate in
a competition in North Carolina. The
Board approved $1,088.44 but denied
$2,071.92 in line with the Allocations
Committee recommendation "because
the amount would put the club over the

STICKING MY NECK OUT

By Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Unless you were a Boy Scout --
spoiler alert: I wasn’t ——-, “pre—
paredness” probably isn’t a value
you’ve really sought to cultivate in
yourself. '

Sure, every geek has a plan for
the zombie apocalypse, but those
plans tend to focus more on which
household objects would make the
best zombie-killing implements,
not the boring details such as “If
I couldn’t get to the grocery store
for fear of having my brains eaten,
would I starve?”

The string of recent emergency
alerts at Pitt has got me thinking
about this. The Pitt police are being
commended, rightfully, for their
quick response to the Western Psy-
chiatric Institute shooting, and it’s
been reported that this level of ef-
fectiveness was achieved through
years of active-shooter drills to pre-
pare the Pitt police force for just
such a situation.

If there’s any lesson to be taken
from that, it’s the value of being
prepared in an emergency. And
that’s something, I can’t help but
notice, that is woefully absent from
my own life.

Perhaps it’s a function of being a

 
 
 

 ee

p Preparedness an underrated value

liberal arts major — maybe students
who have to work with poisonous
or possibly reactive chemicals on
a regular basis have a better sense
of the importance of safety precau-
tions and detailed crisis response
plans. Or maybe I’m just a space
cadet. But whatever the reason, in
my three years at the.University I
haven’t taken the time to note the
location of almost any of the blue—
light boxes scattered around cam-
pus for my safety. I don’t note the
emergency exits when I walk into a
room. And in acrisis situation, that
sort of absent-mindedness — after
all, how long does it really take to
make a note of the blue-light boxes

° around you? — could cost a lot.

Another thing I’ve failed to do
is invest in a ﬁrst aid kit. It’s easy
enough to compile a basic ﬁrst aid
kit —‘— all you need is a shoebox, a

‘ few different sizes of bandages,

gauze, medical tape, a thermom-
eter and some antiseptics to clean
possible cuts and abrasions — but
right this second, if I dropped a glass
and cut myself on a shard, I’d have
to limp three blocks to CVS to buy
gauze.

Furthermore, it wasn’t until I
looked up the recommended con-
tents of a ﬁrst aid kit and noticed
that most medical organizations
instruct you to include a bottle of

syrup of ipecac (to induce vomit—
ing in the case that you swallow
something poisonous), that it ever
occurred to me thatl should really
have the Poison Control number
saved in my phone. 1—800-222-1222
is easy to remember, and it’s even
easier to program into your phone
when there’s no current emergency.
The one thing you DON’T want is
to be frantically Googling the Poi-
son Control number after you or
someone close to you has ingested
something toxic. '

There are a few numbers every-

one must have programmed into
their cell phones. Iﬁnd myselfdoing
pretty well on that front; the Pitt po-
lice are there, SafeRider is present
and accounted for, even less urgent
contacts like Student Health and the
Technology Help Desk all have their
places in my address book.

But frankly, that probably isn’t
good enough. Assuming that bad
things will only happen to you when
you have access to your cell phone
is naive at best. A

I was arrested during the G—20
my freshman year. Handcuffed
across the street from Litchﬁeld
Towers, I could feel my phone vi-
brating in my purse as my room-
mate, who had been my friend for
more than 10 years prior to matricu-

lating at Pitt, called once, twice, three times,
and I was helpless to reach my phone.

I was only able to contact her —- and pass
on the message that she should probably call
my parents — because when the legal ob-
server from the National Lawyers Guild asked
me if there was anyone he could get in touch

with for me, I was able to tell him my room-
mate’s number from memory. If I hadn’t had
Gina’s number burned into my head from
years of dialing it beforel had a cell phone, I
would have agonized all night over whether
she knew why I hadn’t come home, and my
parents would have gotten the news not from
an old family friend, but from a stranger from
the National Lawyers Guild.

Yet in the time since then, I’ve let several
important numbers simply fall out of my head,
or I’ve failed to learn them altogether.

Every person at Pitt, my ditzy self includ-
ed, should have the following phone numbers
committed to memory: their home numbers;
both of their parents’ cell phone numbers if
applicable; all of their siblings’, also if ap-
plicable; SafeRider’s; and those of every per-
son they live with. I would also recommend
memorizing at least one other in—Pittsburgh
emergency number: that of a close friend you
could count on to jump out of bed at 3 a.m.
for you or to walk to CVS and bring you gauze
if you cut your foot on a broken glass. Ifyou

have a signiﬁcant other and the thought of
not being able to get in touch with that person
scares you, you should memorize his or her

. phone number, too.

As these past few weeks have shown, there’s
no reliable way to stop the things,we’re not
expecting from happening. But with some at-
tention to detail and a few safety precautions,
most of the things we’re not expecting don’t

.have to be the things we’re not prepared for.

COLUMN

Look pastparty lines, cons

  

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
Columnist

If you are a conservative, the minute
you set foot on a college campus,
you have committed a mortal sin.
You have betrayed the liberal doc-
trine.

How often do you read a right-
leaning article in The Pitt News?
Exactly. You’re more likely to read -a
passionate plea for the government
to bail out student debt. Well, that
is about to change.

There is a long—standing tradi-
tion of liberal tilts on college cam-
puses. A 2007 Harvard University
working paper by sociologist Neil
Gross is the most recent study that

_tabulates what has been known for

decades. A majority of college pro-
fessors tend to be_ left-leaning, at a
proportion not representative of
the general public. Also, the highly
cited annual freshman survey ad-
ministered by the Cooperative Insti-
tutional Research Program at UCLA
indicates a majority of freshmen
have liberal positions. This certain-
ly sets a tone in the classroom.
Normally, I couldn’t care less
about liberal versus conservative.
Categorizing social and political
views by two general deﬁnitions
and two general political parties is
encumbering. Each party promotes

a groupthink of its own, and an un-
fortunate consequence is that peo-
ple stop thinking for themselves.
They come to standstills because of
one party issue or another.

The liberal spirit that pervades
college campuses causes such
groupthink. And in trying to stay in
line with the party philosophy, peo-
ple allow some important issues to
slide by — like ﬁscal policy. If I were
to cite my conservative views here
and now, I am sure they wouldn’t
go unnoticed. There would be argu-
ments and counterarguments, all in
hope of persuading me to ﬁt in.

With the GOP primaries still in
full swing and the bid for the presi-
dency developing, this has become
a timely issue. Alack of a theme
is evident among Republicans on
campus. Well, who can blame them?
There is no clear-cut front-runner
right now, and each candidate
seems to be out of touch or plain
zany. Except for one.

That would be Rep. Ron Paul.

_The media-blackout man. The

money-bomb man. If there is any
candidate in either party that can

’ actually resuscitate America, it is

this 76-year-old physician.

I do not believe I am alone when
I say I am normally apprehensive
about admitting my support for
Paul. The way the mainstream me-
dia paints the Republican presiden-
tial race makes it almost common
knowledge that this man will not

win. Moreover, on a typical liberal
college campus, it would seem to

. be even more unwise to state such

support. A '

Well, it’s time to come out of the
voting closet. If you truly support
Paul, feel free to express it. Feel.free
to admit it. Do not sacriﬁce ideology
for practicality. Not here. Even if
Paul doesn’t win enough delegates,
I would still support him as an in-
dependent. A

I have my reasons for believ-
ing in him. Foremost, I actually
have faith in this candidate. I trust
what he says is true and that what
he promises will be fulﬁlled if he
were to be elected. I make no com-
promise in supporting him.tHis two
most sensible stances are those on
ﬁscal policy and foreign policy,
and these alone make him the best
candidate. These are our nation’s
greatest concerns right now.

Funds for government spending
for bailouts and health care come
from somewhere. That somewhere
would be the American taxpayers. If
our government decides to bail out
another country through the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, you and I
and others pay. Our national debt
should tell you we have no business
trying to be everyone’s savior.

.I am concerned as much as the
next person for our nation’s securi-
ty. However, national defense is not
the same as militarism. Notice how
our government was in support of

Editorlalrolicleo

NATO’s intervention in Libya. One
might argue this was a humanitarian
effort. If that is the case, I can name

. many other countries that would

need such help, but perhaps they
do not possess what constitutes
“America’s interests.” Remember
the Rwandan Genocide? Let’s get
real. We need to stop policing the
world. For one, it’s not our job. As

well, it might create more negativity '

toward the U.S. than if we were to
choose not tointervene.

Being non-interventionist
doesn’t. make at country isolation-
ist. Is intervening in other peoples’
governments the only way we want
to interact with them?

As it stands, no other GOP can-
didate holds these views.7Instead, i
the Republican alternatives to Paul
promise more of the same. It seems
their underlying mantra is that Iran
is next. Also, no other GOP candi-
date has any plans equivalent to
Paul’s on reinventing our country’s
monetary system.

Political sense would say Paul is
running as a Republican because he
knows running outside of a party is
nearly ﬁitile. After all, you have to
sell a product under a brand name.
Unfortunately, then, people might
dismiss Paul because of assump-
tions about how conservative his
views are. And this is more often
the case on college campuses. '

What I urge-students to do is to
listen to the candidates: What are

ideriRep..Ron Paul    

theyactually saying? Do they have
a record to back up all the values
they purport to possess? Do a little
extra work. You cannot expect the
mainstream media to do it for you.
We have already witnessed their
bias. .

‘Again, the party system is a fail-
ure. The Founders tried to warn us.
George Washington himself said,
“The alternate domination of one
faction over another, sharpened by
the spirit of revenge — natural to
party dissension, which in different
ages and ‘countries has perpetrated
the most horrid enormities — is
itself a frightful despotism.”

It would be ideal if there were
no parties and candidates ran on
their own platforms. Then real
discussions could be had, and in-
tellectual development could be at-
tained. This country’s founders and
political philosophers were not of a
different species. We too can create
real solutions to our problems, as
long as we let go of left versus right
and think for ourselves.

I don’t ask that you support Paul.
But if you do, do not let yourself be '
browbeaten into doing otherwise.
Simply, be wary of what you hear
and what gets repeated so many
times. This “common knowledge”
is often not the whole picture. Seek
out the truth for yourself the old-
fashioned way. I ‘ ‘

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt travels to Butler for CBI semifinal game

By Eric Burrage
Staﬁ Writer

Last season, Butler brought the .

Pitt men’s basketball team’s sea-
son to a bitter end.

The No. 1 seeded Panthers
took on the No. 8 seeded Bulldogs
in a third—round NCAA Tourna-
ment matchup with a bizarre re-
sult that abruptly ended the Pan-
thers’ national title hopes. Now
Pitt will travel to Indianapolis
to face Butler in the postseason
again, this time in the College

Basketball Invitational at 8 to— '

night. .
Despite last season’s heart-

breaking loss, Pitt point guard

Travon Woodall said the Panthers
aren’t looking for revenge.

“We remember what hap-
pened last time we played them,”
Woodall said after Pitt’s CBI quar-
terﬁnal win over Princeton on
Monday. “We’re not looking for
redemption. We just want to go
out there and play against them
like we played against everybody
else. It’s not a rivalry or anything
like that. We just want to go out
there and win.” _

In the final seconds of last sea-

son’s contest, Butler appeared to _

win the game on a layup, but then
star guard Shelvin Mack fouled
Pitt’s Gilbert Brown, Brown made
one free throw to tie the game but
missed the second. Nasir Rob-
inson then fouled Matt Howard
90 feet from the basket, and the
Bulldog forward made the game-
winning ‘free throw. w

Several key players from
both teams have since moved
on, including Brad Wanamaker,
Brown and Gary McGhee for Pitt,
and Mack and Howard for But—
ler. That loss of experience and
production is one of the reasons
both teams are playing in the CBI
instead of the NCAA Tournament
this season.

“Obviously it’s not where we
want to be right now. We want to
be in the NCAA Tournament —-—
and 10 years of doing that, very

few teams have done that,” Pitt V

head coachjamie Dixon said after
the Panthers’ win over Princeton.
“Our season was not what we
wanted it to be, but these guys

  

want to keep playing.”

The Bulldogs are now led by
junior center Andrew Smith, the
only Butler player to average dou-
ble ﬁgures with 10.7 points per

game. He also grabs 5.6 rebounds

a game. Sophomore forward
Khyle Marshall and sophomore
guard Chrishawn Hopkins also
average more than nine points a
contest with 9.5 and 9.1 points,
respectively.

.. ..,.......«............m.... ........_. 4.... .. ._.......

Smith started in the Bulldogs’
NCAA Tournament win over Pitt
last season. ‘He played 21 min‘-
utes, scored seven points and

grabbed two rebounds. Marshall '

played 17 minutes off the bench,
ﬁnishing with six points and six
rebounds.

Pitt defeated Wofford and
Princeton at the Petersen Events
Center to reach the CBI semiﬁ-
nals, while Butler defeated Dela-

_....g. . 4.-. ... . -a -.

Pitt will play its first road game oftlle College Basket ball Invitational against Butler toniglit at 8.

 

ware and Penn in Indianapolis

Tournament
by the 
numbers '

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Can’t wait until the NCAA Tour-
nament resumes on Thursday?
Here’s a breakdown of the ﬁrst
three rounds of the tournament
by the numbers.

5 -—- The number of wins by
the 11 at-large mid—major pro-
grams in the tournament. The
mid-majority’s top four at-large
representatives — Wichita State,
UNLV, Temple and San Diego State
—~ all suffered upsets in the sec-
ond round. Overall, only two mid-
majors, Xavier and Ohio, remain
alive in the Sweet 16.

6 — The number of double-
digit victories by No. 1 seeds in the
opening weekend of the tourna-
ment. Only UNC-Asheville’s scare
of Syracuse and Saint Louis’ battle
with Michigan State threatened a
top seed. This year marks the ﬁrst
time since 2009 that all four No. 1
seeds advanced to the Sweet 16.

3 —— Ohio’s ﬁnish in the regu-
lar—season Mid—American Confer-
ence standings. The Bobcats went
11-5 in—conference but beat pesky
Buffalo (12-4) and favorite Akron
(13-3) to qualify in the conference

tournament for the NCAA Tourna- "

ment. They are the lowest-seeded
team left.

25 -— The percentage of re-
maining teams that hail from the

.«,_

state of Ohio. Besides the Bobcats, .

the Sweet 16 also features Ohio

State, Cincinnati and Xavier. An ’

Ohio team hasn’t won the NCAA
Tournament since 1962, when
Cincinnati won the second of
back—to—back titles.

0 — The number of teams alive
from the Pac-12, West Coast and
Mountain West conferences. The
three conferences combined for
nine bids, but‘2012 wasn’t kind

to the championship hopes of the *2

west.

0 — The number of No. 5 seeds alive in
the tournament. Wichita State and Temple

couldn’t escape tough second—round match- -

ups, while Vanderbilt and New Mexico fell

to No. 4 seeds Wisconsin and Louisville, A

respectively.

0 —— The number of players named Rob
Loe left in the tournament. The tourna-
ment’s announcers were acutely aware of

. the Saint Louis forward’s name and its simi-

larity to that of actor_ Rob Lowe, but they
held back on “rise and ‘St. Elmo’s Fire”’
puns. There was, though, a lot of “Contact”
on more than one occasion in_the paint
against the Spartans. ‘ V

7.1 million — The estimated economic
windfall, in dollars, of the Consol Energy
Center hosting second-round and third-
round games this weekend. Word is not

yet out, though, on whether the Syracuse . 

fans I saw on Atwood Street Friday prefer
Antoon’s or Sorrento’s.

60 — Florida’s combined margin of
victory in its ﬁrst two wins. The Gators
thumped Virginia 71-45 and then ended the
run of darling Norfolk State, 84-50.

4 — The number of games decided by
two points or fewer so far. Western Ken-

tucky’s 59-58 comeback win over Missis- v

sippi Valley State Tuesday and Creighton’s
58-57, win over Alabama Friday are the two
one-point games to date.

2 —~ The number of wins by No. 15 seeds
this year. Norfolk State defeated Missouri
and Lehigh trounced Duke. A 15th—seeded
program hadn’t won a tournament game

Panthers sweep Hartford in
three-game home opener

By Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

Fourteen games into the season, the Pitt
baseball team ﬁnally came home.
The Panthers swept Hartford over the

weeken in their home-opening three-game -

series at Charles L. Cost Field.

Led by senior pitcher Matt Iannazzo, Pitt .

won the series’ ﬁrst game 4-2. The Panthers
then won the second game 8-3 in a solid of—
fensive and defensive performance, while
the Panthers’ bats emerged in the ﬁnal game
of the series for a 10-6 victory.

“Getting the sweep was big for our team,”
sophomore Steve Shelinsky said. “Coming
off an exciting win against Michigan State
and winning these three against Hartford
gives the team a huge conﬁdence boost. Ev-
eryone is contributing a lot to this team, and
it was great to pick up the three wins.”

Senior ﬁrst baseman Rick Devereaux
said the Panthers enjoyed returning home
after spending about a month playing in
Florida and South Carolina.

“Playing at home is always nice, especial-

ly with our great new facility,” Devereaux
said. “The atmosphere just continues to
grow. It was enjoyable.” _ 3

Pitt 4, Hartford 2 .

Iannazzo pitched eight innings for the
Panthers in the opening game of the se-
ries. He recorded seven strikeouts while

walking just one batter and allowing two _

earned runs.

The senio_r’s solid outing earned him
the 100th win of his career. With the win,
Iannazzo moved to ﬁrst all—time on the Pan-
thers’ win list, ahead of Corey Baker, who
graduated last year.

“Matt Iannazzo did a fantastic job on the
mound and became the school’s all—time
leader in wins,” head coach Joe Jordano
said. “I couldn’t be happier for him. Not
only is he a great player, but he is a great
person.”

The offense got off to a quick start for
Iannazzo as the Panthers drew two early
walks after Hartford’s Sean Newcomb strug-
gled to locate the strike zone. Devereaux
knocked a RBI single through the left side
for the ﬁrst run.

After Iannazzo allowed a run in the ﬁfth,
Pitt countered with three big runs in the
bottom of the sixth inning. Derik Wilson
drove in Ronald Sucre on a single to left
ﬁeld, giving the Panthers a lead they would

hold for the rest of the game.

Evan Oswald took a ‘walk, allowing
Stephen Vranka to step to the plate for a
deep hit to right ﬁeld. After a ﬁelding er-

ror, Wilson and Oswald came home for two

more runs. .

Iannazzo came out in the ninth inning
looking for the complete game, but was
greeted with back-to-back doubles by the
Hartford offense. Freshman closer Tanner
Wilt came in to shut the game down and
earn his fourth save ofthe season.

Pitt 8, Hartford 3

Sophomore Ethan Mildren took the
mound for the Panthers in the second game
of the series and alsolgave the Panthers
solid innings. _ . _ I _

He threw seven andltwo —thirds innings,
giving up three earned runson eight hits.

’ The action got started in the third inning
when Mildren surrendered a home run to
HarI:ford’s Andy Drexel to give the Hawks
a 2-0 lead.

In the bottomof that inning, the Pan-
thers responded when junior, Sam Parente
scored on a passed ball. Anthony Defabio
followed with a single that scored Wil-
son. 1-.
vParente7pifcked‘up an RBI of his own
with a»¢singl7e'in the "next inning, scoring
Boo Vazquez.

The sixth inning saw sophomore Casey
Roche connect on his ﬁrst career home run.
With the two-RBI homer, Pitt extended th
lead to 5-2. p _ P

But the Panthers weren’t ﬁnished. After
Hartford’s'JamesvA‘lfonso hit a solo home
run in the top‘ of the eighth to narrow the

A Panthers’ lead to 5-3, Pitt responded with ' 7
three more runs..

Defabio and Devereaux came through
with two singles that ‘scored a total of three
runs and produced the ﬁnal 8-3 score.

funior Alex Caravella pitched one and
a third innings inrelief for Pitt to end the
game.

Pitt 10, Hartford 6

Devereaux led the Panthers in the ﬁnal
game, going 4-5 at the plate with ahome
run and four RBI.

“Rick is our three—hitter,”]ordano said.
“He’s the guy we want out there late in the
game with runners in scoring position. Rick

does a great job and was patient today. He‘ . .

let the ball come to him and in turn hit it
hard.”

Pitt’s pitcher, sophomore Matt Woth-
erspoon, struggled in the ﬁnal outing of
the weekend for the Panthers. He allowed
six earned runs on ﬁve hits in ﬁve innings
of work. The sophomore also walked two
batters and hit two batters.

...With Pitt trailing 3-0, Devereaux’s two-
run home run down the left-ﬁeld line high-
lighted a two—out rally for Pitt in the bottom

of the third. The ﬁve—run inning put the
Panthers on top.

After Hartford tied the game at six in the
ﬁfth inning, jordano made the call to his
bullpen for freshman pitcherjoe Harvey.

Harvey provided a spark for the Pan— ll”

thers in the last four innings. He pitched
shut—out baseball with six strikeouts and
no hits. ‘

“It was great to seejoe pitch the way he
did,”Jordano said. “Hevhelps solidify things

for us in the bullpen. I was very pleased with 2.

his performance todayi’ .

With Harvey on the mound, Pitt added
three runs in the sixth inning and one in
the seventh to extend the score to the ﬁnal
tally of 10-6. I;
