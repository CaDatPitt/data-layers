The Recognition List of Mortar
Board makes its annual appearance
on the campus today.

Following an old tradition in a
nerw_.way, the senior activities fra-
terni ‘ honors prominent women in
a pub ‘cation of its own. This pam-
phlet, listing 110 women, is being

ven to every University woman
£7 members of Mortar Board, who

have been wearing their black Mor-
'tar- boards all the past week.

In commenting on the list, which
is larger than ever before, Hermine
Ruoﬂ’, Col. ’31, president, stated.
“Mortar Board recognizes these
women and commends them for their
work, ﬁne spirit, ability and their

.contributions to Pitt last year.”

The group was selected from ap-
proximately 900 women attending
the University. This includes all in
professional schools, besides those
in the undergraduate schools. No
freshmen are included, since the list
is based on the work and grading
of last year.

The women were not selected ac-
cording to requirements for mem-
bership to Mortar Board, but in ac-
cordance with the policy of the fra-
ternity, which is to foster student
activities. .

y. The selection, in short, is based on
the individual’s scholastic record, a
C average, with no failures or in-
complete work for 1929-1930.

Activities are the second basis of
selection. The person must have been
active on campus, and recognized by
the leaders of the various activities.

-Date On Men’s

Set By__ Heads

Will Not Be Effective,
If Passed, U n t i 1
Next Semester

The Men's Commission", the organ-
ization which will make possible
segregated student government on
the Pitt campus if approved by all
men students, will not be put into
effect until next September. This
decision was made at a conference
Wednesday evening attended by
heads of the three, committees em-
powered with the task of writing
the final draft of the proposed con-
stitution.

Elimination of the Senior Court
which was originally advocated for
the purpose of making nominations
to the Union and hearing student
violations of University rulings, was
also made by the conference Troup.
Two standing committees to be
named by the Union were proposed.
A nomination committee and a ju-
dicial committee to be named by the
Commission were proposed as sub-
stitutes for the Court.

Committee

Those attending the conference,
which at a meeting of the general
committee before the Christmas
holidays was empowered with pre-
paring the constitution for the
Men’s‘ Commission in its ﬁnal ﬁoufin,

. ' liided... _ 
igi, general chairman; _Cha'rles Set-ll

tive committee; “Maurice, Naumoff,
Bus. Ad. '31, chairman of the ju-
dicia-1 committee, and Edward Crow-
der, Bus. Ad. ’31, chairman of the
legislative committee. I -

Although the new form of gov-
ernment will not go into effect un-
til ‘next fall,.the roposed constitu-

‘ tiionof the Commission will be sub-

mitted to a referendum early in the
next semester and if passed, mem-
bers to the Commission will be
chosen at the regular spring elec-
tions to be held in May.

Cite Reasons

Lack of time in which to put a
program into effect and an eifort
to prevent disruption of the present
set-up of University government or-
ganizations determined the decision
of the committee in selectin Sep-
tember as the earliest possib e date
to start the Commission function-
ing, according to Fishkin, general
chairman.

Reasons given for discarding the
proposed Senior Court included the
fact that such a set-up had not
proven successful wh tried in
other large Universiti and that a
nominating committee could per-
form the same functions.

Accozding to the plans of the con-
ference group, the nominating com-

3 mittee will ‘make all nominations to

membership in the Commission, al-
though aspirants not nominated by
this -committee may petition for a
place on the ballot.

If the Commission is passed at the
referendum, the nomination'cominit-
tee for the ﬁrst year will be named
by the resent Student Council,
which wil cease to exist at the end
of this school year. '

The committeevchairmen will meet
February 5 to consider further al-
terations in the original constitu-

tional draft for the new Commission.

Plan Memorial
F or Alderman

S c h 0 ol of Education Will
Honor Deceased Dean

Students in the school of educa-
tion assembled in the Banquet Room
of Memorial Hall last Friday and
decided that each of them should
subscribe ﬁfty cents for the pur-
chase of a memorial for Dr. Grover
H. Alderman, former dean of the
school of education. According to
J. ‘William Goody, ’31, c ‘ of
the committee appointed, to take
charge of the proceedings, a. sub-

stantial part of the money has al-,

ready been contributed:

‘Dr. H. C. McKown, professor in

secondary education, spoke at the
assembly and encouraged the idea
of an Alderman Memorial that is
entirely a student project. He dis-
cussed some of the ideals and ambi-
tions of Dean Alderman and urged
a memorial to them. He told how
Dean Alderman had worked to raise
the school of education to its posi-
tion of prestige. and importance.
. ’ “McKown had, ﬁnished
certain students interested in dedi-
cating a memorial to the memory
of Dean Alderman, presented the
proposition for student approval.
He opened the discussion and asked
for comments on the nature‘ and the
location of the memorial.

Consider Bronze Plaque‘

The committee that was later ap-
pointed _ is tentatively considering
the purchase of either a small

bronze plaque or a gold etching. A

few short sentences engraved upon

‘the plaque or added to the etching

will convey the esteem in which the
students held Dean Alderman. The
location of the memorial has not
been deﬁnitely decided. _

Representatives of the classes in
the school of education-Malrgai-_et
Hall, '31; Anne Kovach, ’32; Wil-
1iam~Beck, ’33, and Ralph Holt, ’34-—
made short speeches requesting the
su rt of the project.

Dorothy Mohr, ’34, as well as the

Bulletin

Pitt. . . . . 22
Fordham . . 14

In one of the poorest exhibi-
tions of basketball seen at the
stadium this year, Pitt main-
tained its perfect record in com-
petition with eastern schools by
defeating Fordham, 22-14.

The Panther oﬁense failed to
click, but the frequent fouling
of the New Yorkers and Tim
Lawry’s accuracy at the free
throw line enabled Pitt to win.

Fordham likewise was weak
in its offense, and its player
tried one long shot after an-
other.

Co-captain Eddie Baker and
the new $1,000 heating system
made their ﬁrst appearance of
the season.

The Pitt-frosh won the pre-’
liminary game over Uniontown
Junior college, 29-14.

To Frat Men

Clothier Speaks To Group At
Meeting‘ Last Night

 

More than forty representatives
to Interfraternity Council were en-
tertained by the Fraternity Commit-

tee of the University at dinner last
n1-ghtat the University Club. The
program devoted to talks on aspects
of the fraternity situation at Pitt.

Dean of Men Robert C. Clothier,
who_ served as toastmaster of the
evening, said that the Fraternity
Committee was glad of the chance
to get together with the members of
Interfraternity Council for the pur-
poses of the two organizations were
to promote a strong fraternity situ-
ation on the campus. He said that a
strong fraternity situation was one
in which individual fraternities are
strong in ﬁnancial standing, person-
al, scholarship and cultural inﬂu-
ence.

Dean Clothier also stressed the
point that it was the desire of the
Fraternity Committee to co-operate
as the Council wished and said that
the committee had never taken ac-
tion in which the undergraduate
members, who are also members of
Interfrate-rnity, Council, have not
concurred.

Ferd C. Arens, Kappa Sigma,
president ~ of Interfraternity Coun-
cil, said that in the recent under-
graduate interfraternity conference
held recently in New York, the Pitt
Council had served in many ways as
a criterion for other schools seek-
ing to strengthen their fraternity
situations. _ ‘

Other speakers on last night's
program included: C. L. Van Sickle,
who spoke on “Fraternity Faculty
Advisers”; Fred Lucas, Theta Delta
Psi, who spoke on “Linking Up the
Fraternity With the Parents”; Eu-
gene Pry, Phi Gamma Delta, who
described the signiﬁcant features of
the recent convention held by his
fraternity; and Prof. Robert Ayars,
who commented on the importance
of scholarship as a factor in a strong

‘ fraternity situation.

the grant of a charter to the
that the founders aimed to do
the University of Pennsylvania
of the state. The older name.

' -ﬁtern. University of Pennsylvania, suggests a responsibility
toxextend service beyond the Pittsburgh campus. The Univer-
gigy has been assuming this Obligation by establishing after-

11 and evening extension courses<°‘r

have been made, covering a period
of years, of a large number of jun-
ior college students who had trans-
ferred .to Stanford University, in
comparison with 'uniors and seniors
who had had al . of their college
work there.

It was found that in intelligence
ratings, grades in college, numbers
graduating with honors and mem-

ers continuing with post-graduate
work, the junior colle e group led
with a distinctly big or average
than the “native ’ students. The Ex-
tension Division of the University
of Pittsburgh has found that the
students at Johnstown have main-
tained for the junior year in 25 col-
leges an average equal to or better
than their two years’ work in the
Johnstown Junior College. This
study will be pursued further after
this year.

Purpose of Centers

Overlooking the subject of admin-
istration, organization and control,
there_ is something to be said re-
garding the motives and purposes
of the University of Pittsburgh and
its itunior colleges.‘

T e idea of an educational re-
sponsibility of the University of
Pittsburgh to the people of Western
Pennsylvania has already been men-
tioned. The University is attempt-
mg to_. provide facilities for higher
‘education for which there is a deﬁ-
nite demand and which, at present,
no other agency is prepared to fur-
nish. o g

The cost of a college education is
reduced for students who could not
go elsewhere. By living at home
and attending one of the junior col-
leges. a student can save the large
item of living expenses incident to
boarding. The University is bring-
ing a college education within the
reach of hundreds of youn people
well qualiﬁed to continue t eir edu-
cation. It is an attempt to equalize
educational opportunities among
worthy groups in thickly populated
districts.

The junior colleges have the ad-
Vantage of being) a part of the Uni-
versity of Pitts urgh. The credits
earned by junior college students
thave the status of all other cred-
its of the University of Pittsburgh
and are accepted by accredited in-
stitutions as such.

Rapid Growth

_The junior colleges of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh have grown rap-
idly. _In 1927 there were 141 stu-
dents in the Johnstown Junior Col-
lege. In 1930 there are 543 day
students enrolled as freshmen and
sophomores at Johnstown, Erie and
Un1ontown._ It has been found that
the proportion of hiﬁh school grad-
l13t_eS 80103’ on to co ege. has great-
y increased in the Johnstown, Erie
and Uniontown districts. where our
Junior colleges have been estab-
lished. .

The junior colleges, moreover,
l30St-pone the age of leavin home
for the immature boy or gir . They
meet the demands which science
now makes in industry for higher
trained intermediate workers in
business, engineering and the lab.
oratorysciences. They bring the
humanities to more communities
and establish new centers of culture
and of adult education on a higher
level. As educational units, our off-
campus centers have their own ex-
cuse for being.

Committee ‘ Conducts

Survey Of Able
Students

 

A lea for more selective entrance
requ rements, especially until stu-
dents are placed in groups accord-
ing to their scholastic standings
was made by Professor Roswell
Johnson, head of the department of
oil and gas production and chair-
man of the committee on Excep-
tionally Able Youth, at a luncheon
meeting of the University Person-
nel Council at the Faculty Club,
Tuesday noon.

Twenty-ﬁve suggestions for the
purpose of “attracting, stimulating
and retaining” exceptionally able
s.u-dents were made in the interest-
ing report of the committee headed
b Dr. Johnson. Prominent among
tllese recommendations, in addition
to that of more selective entrance
requirements, were:

(1) Renew scholarships only to
students who maintain at least a
quality point average of 1.75. This
is an increase of .75 over the aver-
agte required for renewal at pres-
en .

Revive Honor Roll

(2) Revive the registrar's honor
roll of students of high scholastic
standing, the list to be given pub-
licity in student publications.

(3) Continue activity toward
bringin Phi Beta Kappa to the
Univers ty.

(4) Continue present policy of
honors courses and project courses
by means of which upperclassmen
o promise may start research
work.

(6) Classify students into homo-
geneous groups according to their
"scholastic avera es. ~

A number 0 the recommenda-
tions will be discussed at a special
meeting of the Personnel Council to
be held probably within the next
three weeks, and such of the rec-
ommendations as receive endorse-
' ment will be sumbitted to the Uni-
versity Council or other administra-
tivelbodies for adoption or rejec-
tlon.

Although not indicating _what
changes should be made in entrance
requirements except that they
should be strengthened, Dr. Johnson
pointed out that in this way the
University could be made attractive
to more students with high academic
standing in the district high schools
and that stricter requirements would
also prevent excessive weakening oi‘
underclass work.

Classify Students

The committee stressed the im-

ortance of putting students

omogeneous groupings according
to their scholastic standings if stu-
dents are to be able to progress ac-
cording to their abilities. Under
such a classiﬁcation, it was held
the more capable students would
not be retarded by those less able.
nor would these latter ones be ad-
vanced to stages beyond their ca-
pacity. -

The honor roll, as formerly pub-
lished b the oiiice of the registrar,
was sai to be valuable in that stu-
dents seeking this approbation for
excellent work would be influenced
to apply themselves more vigorous-
ly to t eir studies.

The suggestions of the committee
on Exceptionally Able Youth were
made after an intensive survey of
the entire range of undergraduate
scholastic achievements as indicated
from the results of the semester
averages of all undergraduates and
the mental and placement tests ad-
ministered to freshmen. , .

More than twenty-ﬁve members
of the administration attended the
Tuesday meeting and participated
in the brief discussion following Dr.
Johnson’s report.

duced rates for the Raisa-Rimini

Freshmen entering Pitt will be
the first to register on February 2,

All other students will register
February 2, 3, and 4 with second se-
mester classes meeting for the first
time on Thursday, February 5. _

The second semester registration
period was advanced in the calendar
as there was no justification in
keeping over 5,000 students idle

observed between semesters, accord-

Then. something happened! Without warning, the
rear man-built, barrier crumbled. A vast flood reared
its bulk into a ferocious torrent-smashed every-
thing thet stood in its path. Another unwarranted ,
disaster, Lives lost! Property destroyed! Why?

An Engineering News-Record editor in San Francisco
jumped 22 fast train. Rapidly be surveyed the scene;
investigated and photogra bed the remaining traces
of structural fault; wired his paper.

Fast news? Yes, but what of his story? Nothing sen-

sational in ‘the story he wired-no wrath-stirring
adjectives calculated to arouse public sentiment. This
editor tersely related the reasons for the disaster-—
scientiﬁcally pieced together the causes of founda-
tion, failure--gave construction engineers the facts
which they could not get from newspaper stories.-

Many weeks later an official investigating commission
confirmed, almost to a word, that first telegraphic
flash of the McGx-aw-Hill editor. Meantimes, editors
of metropolitan dailies used the McGraw-Hill story

to reassure their readers that similar disasters were
‘ not likely to occur in other places.

Each McG,'raw-Hill Publication has built a splendid
reputation among leaders of industry and business
for truth, leadership, constructive foresight. From

Class Committees Organize
With Upper Class Heads

 

With the choice of each fresh-
man woman classiﬁed according to
the committee on which she wishes
to serve, deﬁnite organization of
the class of 1934 has commenced in
earnest.

At an executive committee meet-
iifiig last Friday in Heinz House an
o icer of the class was appointed
to take charge of the formation of
these groups. Ruth Bowser, Ed.,
secretary, is to aid in the organiza-
tion of the hostess committee; Dor-
is Custer, Col., treasurer, is in
charge of the publicity committee;
the vice president, Ruth Drum, Col.,
has charge of class sports, and Bet-
ty Maus, Col., W. S. G. A. repre-
sentative, is helping the social com-
mittee.

All women who have elected one
of these committees are to meet in
these various groups this week in
order to elect a chairman of the
committee and to start plans for ac-
tive work.

Upperclass Coeds Aid

There are a number of upper-
classwomen who have been chosen
by Miss Helen Rush, assistant to
the dean of women, and Naomi
Ericson, vice president of W. S. G.
A., and chairman of the organiza-
tion committee, to supervise the
women in their numerous projects.
Christine,Ruoif, ’32, is in
charge of the social committee;
Helen Glynn, Col. ’33, is helping
the publicity group, and Alice Wal-
ton, Ed. ’31, is supervising class
sports.

These groups are a part of the
plan of t e new form of organiza-
tion for freshman women decided
upon by W. S. G. A. Instead of
serving on a committee of any ma-
jor organization on campus, they
will work only in these freshman
groups, and thus become better ac-
quainted with all organizations
since these committees will in turn
aid the larger organizations in their
major projects.

Lanfear Giv
Business Talk

Addresses Alpha Kappa Psi
On “Commercial World”

Successfully inaugurating its se-
ries of weekly luncheons, Alpha
Kappa Psi, national professional
commerce fraternity, was host at
the first Tuesday meeting in the

Roosevelt Hotel to approximately
seventy-ﬁve active and alumni mem-

the city.

Dr. Vincent Lanfear, director of
the downtown division, spoke on
“Relationships Between the Major
Problems in the Business World.”
In his talk, Doctor Lanfear dis-
cussed small and large scale pro-
ductive industries and how ‘they af-
fected the country, especially in
times of depression. ‘_‘The reason
the present depression is so notice-
able,” said Doctor Lanfear, “is _due
to the rapid methods of communica-
tion as contrasted to those of 1907,
when the country went through. a
similar period. Today’s_ depression
is more before the public and this
tends to make the public think more
and react against it in terms of
psychology.” _

Topics to be discussed at future
meetings include Finance, Account-
ing, Distribution, Transportation
Problems and Commerce. These
subjects will be treated by leading
men on campus and in the business

Pitt Aviation Class
Visits Local Airport

.Members of the class in commer-
cial aviation, section C, were the

ests of the Pittsburgh Aviation
ndustries Corporation last Sunday
afternoon, when they were conduct-
ed on an inspection tour of the Pitts-
burgh-Butler airport, home field of
that company, located north of the
city on the Butler pike.

The students were taken through
the ground school_ and repair shops
where welding, wing structure re-
building and motor _1'ePa11'S are
made on planes operating from the
airport. The trip was _planned to
give the students some insight into
the many phases of airport man-
agement, one of the aspects _of confl-
rnercial aviation considered in their
course at the University. _

Before leaving the port. the via-
itors made a short sight-seeing
ﬂight over the airport vlclnlty 111
one of the several ships kept busy
at the ﬁeld every Sunday after-
noon.

Another section of ‘the course,
composed of students .11! the down-
town division, will visit the airport
next Sunday afternoon, weather
permitting.

I PROMISED to tell you some
more about the Werme School of
Music, 220 Stanwix street, which I
visited last week--and here it is. As
I said before, this music school will
lend you an instrument, give you
lessons in either classical music or
jazz, from the best teachers, and, in
case you choose jazz, give you the
opportunity of practicing with a jazz
orchestra. Orchestras from this
school are available at very reason-
able prices for all sorts of rushing
affairs and dances. Visitors at their
Sunday afternoon practices are very
welcome-—-01', if you can't drop in
some Sunday afternoon, listen in to
them when they broadcast over
WCAE at 7 o'clock next Saturday
night. ’ * *

THE COLUMN’S close proximity
to “These and Those” seems to be
affecting us--anyway if we may be
permitted to nominate a retaur-ant
for this week's limelight, we sug-
gest the Betsy Ross, Forbes and
Oakland avenues, that popular ren-
dezvous of the college students. And
no wonder it’s popular——for you get
well-cooked food, excellent service
and a friendly atmosphere—and,
best of all, the prices are suited to
the undergrad’s pocket.

NOTHING makes more of an im-

ANY TIME’S the time to--no, not
to fall in love, but to get your pho-
tograph taken. Frank Totino, 3710
Forbes street, will give you prompt

lute guarantee if you are not satis-
ﬁed with results. He is certainly
good, too, if I can judge by the
sample pictures of some of my
friends, which I saw in the studio.
Honestly, I didn't know there were
so many good-looking people at Pitt.
Which all goes to show that you
should patronize the photographer
who does you justice. '

By LIEUT.-COL. E. J. CULLEN.
U. 5. Army

By our Constitution, we, as citi-
zensof the United States, have nec-
essarily surrendered to --our law-
makers, our Congress, the full and
exclusive right to declare war, and
by the same token we have imposed
upon Congress the “corresponding
duty of providing for the common
defense; that is, the duty of provid-
ing the necessary military and naval
forces required for the defense of
the nation. ,

But these armed forces are mere-
ly the tools used by the government
in military operations against the
enemy. The power and authority to
make war is vested wholly and ex-
clusively in congress. The statesman
makes the war, the soldier merely
jeopardizes his own life and limb in
an “effort to bring the war toa suc-
cessful conclusion. Armies ‘do "not
make wars, they merely ﬁght them,

rticularly in a democracy such as
Is the United’ States of America.

‘The National Defense Act insures,
in the event of the outbreak of war,
that the armed forces of our nation
will possess sufficient strength of
numbers, adequate equipment, prop-
er organization, and most important
of all, suitable training. And all this,
is accomplished without violating
our traditional opposition to the
maintenance of any extensive mili-
tary forces in time of peace. _

The National Defense Act provides
for the army of the United States.
to consist of the regular Iarmy,Ithe
national guard I and the organized

reserves, the latter to consist prin- .

cipally of reserve olficers in time of
peace, with only a limite‘ number of
enlisted specialists. The organized
reserves are organized as units of
the various arms and services, and
the officers‘ aretrained in peacetime
in the duties of their respective
grades. . ‘ '
I ‘ Furnish Oﬂicers ,.

The ‘organized. reserves can be
placed on a war footinggpromptly at
the outbreak of war by the induction
into tithe military service of the
requisite number of so1d~iers~to fill
out the units necessaryto meet the
emergency. In a major war the or-
ganized reserves would have to fur-
nish \tW0 ‘hundred thousand officers
since there are but twenty-‘ﬁve
thousand officers in the regular
gymg and the national guard com-

Tomorrow evening the rumbling-
Mountaineers from West Virginia
will attempt to achieve one of the
toughest tasks any basketball team
can our face; they will be trying to
turn in their second ‘successive win
over a Pitt aggregation. The Mor-
gantown bunc ‘stopped Carlson’s
team on the West Vifginia ﬂoor last
year when Chipper Charley and his
mates were all set to give them a
merciless drubbing. Pitt's drubbing
wasn't merciless but it wasljust as
bad, and quite a few things are li-
able to happen around eight o'clock

tomorrow evening when the Pan-.

thers set out against their West Vir-
ginia playmates. And by the way,

gentle playmates.
us-on‘.

Just before the season started
(and for a very short time after-
wards -- meaning Western Reserve)
Pitt's chances for another great
team looked about as cheerful as 2!
scotch Santy Claus. Hyatt and Zeb-
fuss and Cohen would be too much
of a loss to overcome, so thought
prsctic 'ly (yeh practically) every-
one. in by now the Pitt team has
won some mighty important ball
games and other bchools are taking
1:
eyes.

. _'...o_.

.,Last week at N. Y. U. the team
went to town on an avalanche of
ﬁeld goals. Bus Albri ht, the big
boy from Uniontown w seems to
be making good, played one of the
the best games of his career. He is
no L0! Cohen, as yet, but he is put-
ting up i a mighty sweet defensive
game, and the scoring side may de-
velop later. Another big reason
why the Panthers are looking better
is the return of “Willie” Kowallis
to his old position. Now if Don
Smith regains his early season
' stride, everything will be all set so

far as winning, games is concerned.

have been a little off durin its vis-

like that should make Doc Carlson
feel quite O.K. Wh(n a team is
liable to beat a fo.e like Syracuse

year before; that is ﬁne. But con‘-

Ohio Team Plans To
Trim Panthers In
Opening Game

The University of Pittsburgh foot-
ball team will open its 1931'sesson
against the strong Miami University
0 Oxford, Ohio.

1 Miami has dominated athletics in
southern Ohio for the last twenty
years. The Ohio team has played a.
number of the “big ten” schools, but
next season will be the ﬂrst time that
it has played a Pitt squad in any
sport. 4 v ’

Last year, Miami had the worst
football year in its history. Foot-
ball prospects at Miami ar not
very bright due to the loss the
entire line and two backﬁeld men.
Wilbur Cartwright, their star, is
slated to return. Cartwright, 9. Mi-
amisburg boy, gained more yardage
than all Miami’s op onents last year.
He was considers the outstanding
back of the Buckeye Conference an
was chosen ‘on every All—State and
All-Buckeye Conference team.

Head Coach Plttser, a former Illi-
nois star, predicts that Miami. will
have a strong team and has pinned
his hopes on the 1930 freshman
squad. Since Pitt is Miami’s out-
standing opponent, the big “Red”
team will try its best against the

 

, Panthers.

The University of Pittsburgh's
football schedule is as follows:
Sept. 26--Miami at the Stadium.
Oct. 8--Iowa State, Iowa City.
Oct. 10--W. Virginia, Stadium.
Oct. 17--Western Reserve, Sta-

u .

Doc "Carlson

By ABE FEINBERG

Strolling through Alumni Hall a
week ago Thursday, one of the men
on the basketball team asked this
ambitious young journalist why he
didn't go over to basketball practice
and see the moving pictures Dr.
Carlson was showing. Putting on
that digniﬁed air that most report-
ers don’t have, I slowly assented, not
wishing to seem overanxious. At the
same time I was saying to myself:
“Imagine getting a ‘scoop’ on the

ing why they didn’t know anything
about Coach Carlson teaching the
boys another new-fangled way of
playing basketball. _
I arrived at the gym a little early,
only a few freshmen being _on the
court indulging in the pastime of
twent -one (basketball game _not
cards. I had always wondered if it
were true that the subs and the
freshmen came on the floor first. But
‘the first man on the ﬂoor was Wil-
lie Arturo, then Milt Cohen came
on, and Buss Alb:-1ght._ So I w-ll
never believe that varsity men take

Just then Dr. Carlson staggered
in don’t take that literally). Swag-
ge g over to the best coach in the
world, I asked’-him if it would be
0. K. for me to see the pictures. Dr.
Carlson said: “Surely,” but looked
at me queerly, and I thought there
must be something wro’ng. But
just put it down to a coach's natural
reluctancy to let reporters know
anything. -

Dr. Carlson then called the boys
over in the dressing room to _show
them the pictures. Not suspecting a
thing, I sat down to listen to the ple-
tures ‘(I meant see them; I forget
they weren’t “talk1es”). I thought
the Dr. was going to serve 168 cream
as usual, but he had a toothache and
couldn't stand to see anybody else

as well stay and see the pictures as I
also had been west the past summer.

Doc ﬂrsttook usto Denver and
Pikes Peak, and told the boys that
next year they would get to see it.
As.I found out, anyhow, thatthe

I also found out that Coach Carl-
son took’ quite 3. delight in “riding”
himself. Once when he was shown
trying ﬂoating on his back in the
Great Salt Lake in Utah, he said:
“There's the old man, boys!” V

One of the boys popped up and
said: “I thought you .c'O‘.ll(ll1Z_sW1l¥la

dumb as not to know you can’: go

Probably the dumbest question

“do they use irrigation for? The Dr.
smartly replied: “To wash their face

crack were Milt Cohen and
Milt’s dad has a furniture store in

niontown). -
Personally, I think that Coach
Carlson should give educational

talks once a week. The basketball
men found out about irrigation, the
height of Pikes Peak, and that you
cant drown in salt water. I also
learned always to ask what kind of
pictures. More and better pictures,

After Regular Season Has Ended

dium on the 27th of December, was
sponsored by the Shriners. And the
Shriners didn’t quibble when it came
to making the boys feel at home.
There was the trip through their
palatial hos ital and then there was
Christmas ay and wrist watches
for all the boys, watches inscribed
with something or other. It was a
real Christmas for Ed. He was re-
membered from somewhere. He was
surprised at the amounts of tele-
grams, cards, and gifts he received.
Visits Regis Toomey ,
And then Los Angeles and Holly-
wood. Believe this if you will, and
you must believe everything the
skipper says, it rained nine days out
of , twelve in Los Angeles. But Ed
got in some visits. Joe E. Brown
asks to be remembered to Jock
Sutherland and the squad and maybe
he included the school. Ed stayed
with Regis Toomey for several days.
Mary Brian is the sweetest girl in
Hollywood. Oh, well, you know that.

_ Ed me-t everybody who is really any-

body. Andhe liked them all and
they all liked him.

And then Ed took a little trip to
Agua Caliente. Saw the races.

Roamed around a bit.‘ But he didn’t

entirely forgot the school. If you are
half-way clever, you will guess that
there might own have been a school
book or two tucked away into Ed’s
suitcase. Oh, yes, the gir_ls in movie-
land are quite lovely.’

And home. Snow and ice and zero
weather. Coeds and dentistry school

. and basketball. Maybe Eddie is glad

to get back, maybe he isn’t. But, re-
gardless, he islback and I suppose
at ‘is ‘just about all that matters.

Assislanl Managers
Ballle For Posiiion

The manager of the 1931
football team has as yet been
undecided. This event, althou hp
seemingly unimportant to t e
. majority of the campus, holds a
great interest for three men and
the sports stall’. Assistant man-
agers _ Bernard “Bernie” Windt,
Robert “Bob” "logs, and Frank
,G<‘1)odfellow are ﬁghting for the
o , - .

"! ‘Untilreccntly the naming of
‘the.new:inanager came as an
added event ‘. the Football

"Banquet but during the last few
years it has been held over until
lziter in the year. As only five
‘men elect the 'man‘agcr, we are
wondering why those men could
not get together to decide upon

, a manager. To hold them over
until after sprin _trainlng not
only works 9. ha ship upon the _
boys but also lessens" the morale
of next ycar’s assistant man-
agers.

If a new manager was ap-
pointed to assume his position
at the Lginninﬁ of the: curly ’
«training,—he woul be able to get
his sssi. Eants in ‘control. and
then by the time the falltraln-1
‘ing camp opened, he could han-
dle the job more eﬁiciently and
beable to insure Dr. Sutherland
that so far as valet: are con-
cerned, the team was complete.

Although the manager plays
little or no ‘at’ inthe gridiron
battles, it is his work and the
work of his staff that keeps
the heroes contented. And like
a certain brand of milk, a foot- _
ball team is no good unless its
principals are contented.

even, West Virginia being one of
the two teams which defeated the
Panthers. In the first engagement,
the Carlson passers had a two-point
lead at the beginning of the sec-
ond half, and from then on they
held the ball in the back court, re-
fusing to attempt to penetrate the
stonewall defense of the visitors.
As a result, the Panthers won by
a 21-19 score when the Mountain-
eers made no scoring attempts un-

The Mountaineers employ the
their chances for a victory over the

All great men (including sport writers) make mistakes, and there is
no doubt in my mind that I committed the gravest error of my short
career as a sport writer last week when I chose to write on the subject
winch I did. I made quite a fewerrors in judgment, but my friendly an-
tagonist was also guilty of the same breaches}

It is useless, however, to carry on a controversy through journalism
if neither party concerned will admit an error in his judgment. I believe
that Bob Hughes and myself can best settle our little diﬁiculty by com-

ing together over a dining table.

I therefore take this opportunity to extend Bob an invitation
to dine with me at my fraternity house Tuesday afternoon,
January 20, at 1 o'clock. You will need no bodyguard, Bob. P
advise me of your acceptance or of your decline of my o er.
but please make an‘ effort to accept.

In the advent that you do accept, myefraternity is Sigma

We journeyed down to the Carnegie Tech gym Wednesday night to
see the Tartans play Western Reserve. Inasmuch as we_missed the Cleve-
land school's game with Pitt, we were very anxious to look Coach Clifford's

boys over.

We were disappointed, however. as Western Reserve ' was.sorrow-
fully “off” that night; and the Tartans were not extended. to win by 21

points.

After the game, we walked into the Reserve ‘dressing room and

discussed basketball with Coach Clifford of the losers.

...._..o..._.
‘Tliere is no doubt that Pitt has a better basketball team
than weliave,” commented the Reserve coach. “But we were
better prepared than Pitt was when we met its team earlier in
the season. We knew that our only chance to win the game lay in
our advantage of being, in better condition than the Pitt team.
“Pitt was just coming along then. .We were fortunate in
getting the jump on them, and everything which we tried worked

out perfectly.

“The Panthers, on the other hand, found themselves in the same
difficulty in which my team found itself tonight. Being in the rear, they
hurried their passing and their shooting; both were off-color. - '

."If we were to play Pitt again, .the.Panthers would probably beat us

by 10 points. Coach Carlson is one of the best basketba

l coaches in the‘

country, and his work, this year'_has. really been marvelous.”

Our discussion then wandered into other channels, and ﬁnally
we started to discuss the probable results of Pitt's next two

games with West Virginia and

Carnegie Tech.

“Pitt should have little trouble against West Virginia on
Saturday,” continued Clifford. “The Mountaineers do not have a

very good team this year.

 O ’ I
“If both Bitt and Tech play their usual game, Pitt should win by

ten- points. Of -course, there is a. chance that Pitt might be “oﬁ” that‘

night just as they were against us and Tech might be “on” just asthey
were against us. In that event, the Tartans would have a good chance of

winning. -

“Tech, however, has just played two great I games in a row; and

they are bound to slacken their pace. Yes, Pitt should beat Tech.” _
We asked Mr. Clifford about the rating of Miami University,

Pitt will probably play Western Reserve only once next
year on the basketball court. The Reserve team this year is com-
posed mainly of sophomores, and Coach Cliﬁorq “J that he
‘will be satisﬁed to break: even in the matter of victories this

. ..n.

In two» years, however, he expects his team to be able

to battle teams ‘of Pitt’: calibre (when the‘Panthers are “on’-’) on

Band Moves
To Cathedral

Orchestra, Glee Club Plan
For Spring Concerts

 

No longer will the strains of
Verdi and Sousa re-echo from the
walls of Engineer's Drawing Room
on Frick Acres, Manager Philip

Blank, Col. '31, of the University
band, announced last Tuesday night
at the regular practice. The old
frame shack, which was once used as
a stable, is to be torn down and
the band will no doubt practice on
the sixth floor of the Cathedral. The
band is now practicing for the an-
nual home concert, which will take
place Friday, April 29.-

Although no deﬁnite date has been
set for the concert of the symphony
orchestra, the group, after several
successful pre-holiday appearances,
is awaiting the first home concert
in history. It will be held on a
date soon to be ‘agreed on by Grad-
uate Manager Walter Rome and
Arthur George, Dent. "32, orchestra
manager. Real concert numbers are
included in the club's repertoire this
season.

Due to the enthusiastic approval
of the dean of Wilson College, where
the Men's Glee Club sang last year,
it now appears that the glee club
may travel to Fairfax Hall of
Waynesboro, Va., as part of this
year's concert work. The director
of the club, Dr. W. H. Wright, is
pleased with the attendance and
spirit of the men, who are working
on a complete concert program.

New York U. Falls ‘
Before Pitt Cagers

~ Pitt's varsity cagemen were cred-
ited with seven wins and three
losses after their fray with N. Y.
U. last Saturday night, in which
they emerged victorious by a score
of 40 to 22.

Both‘ teams used the same type
of ﬂoor work, but the Blue and
Golders were the much faster quin-
tet and demonstrated plenty of ac-
curate basket shooting. “Doc” Ko-
wallis led the scoring siege with a
total of 12 points and was followed
by “Willie" Arture and “Tim” Law-
ry, each of whom scored 10 points.
Sam Siegely, a forward for the
hosts, managed to score eight mark-
ers, making him high scorer for his
squad.

The New York critics said’ that
Pitt demonstrated the best brand of
collegiate basketball ever shown
there. They called Carlson the
"Rockne of Basketball.”

Fifty-two Ca.-hdi—dates Report
To Coach Shea

Twenty-nine varsity and twenty-
three freshman candidates answered
Coach Frank J. Shea’s ﬁrst call for
track candidates Monday afternoon.
Coach Shea was well pleased with
the turnout, and after looking over
the names of the freshman aspi-
rants, he stated that he expected to

have one of the best frosh track
teams to represent the Panthers in
the past few years.

Among the more prominent men
to report were Tom Milligan, city
scholastic dash champion for the
past two years; John Valenti. the
big frosh football player, who has
been working out daily with the
weights since the close of the foot-
ball season and who can put the 12-
pound shot over 55 feet at pres-
ent; O’Dell, a better than 12-foot
pole vaulter; Kirkpatrick, a great
high jumper, and Eisenbart and
May of the successful cross-country
team. _

Five Lettermen Return

The outlook for the varsity,
however, is not as bright as that
for thefreshmen. But ﬁve letter-
men from last year's mediocre team
are back in school.

The team is fairly strong in the
sprints, but the other departments
are either weak or uncertain. If
several of the football players can
ﬁnd time to combine the two sports,
the Panthers should have a better
team than that which represented
them last ear. _

Four in oor meets have been ar-
ranged for the Pitt spikers while a
dua1.meet with the Mountaineers is
pending. _

The Panthers will compete in the
West Virginia Indoor Invitation
Meet on February 14, in the I. C.

Pitt’: Dean Of Women Guest
Of Cento.-"s W. S. G. A.

 

Uniontown Center.—Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women, visited Union-
town Center, Wednesday, January
14, as a guest,of the Women's Self-
Governing Association..At a 1 o'clock
luncheon in the Gallatin Room of
the White Swan Hotel, she talked
to the girls of the Center on “Un-
derstanding Ourselves.” Mrs. Ruth
Graham, faculty adviser of the W.
S. G. A., introduced Miss Amos.
Mrs. Kendall S. Tesh was a guest
at the luncheon.

W. S. G. A. entertained the wives
of the members of the Center fac-
ulty at a tea Wednesday afternoon
given for Miss Amos. Mrs. Tesh
acted as guest hostess. Miss Amos
spoke to the guests at the tea on
“Happiness.”

In her talk on “Understanding Our-
selves,” Miss Amos‘ asked the girls
to consider why they are going to
college. Many a moron says that he
is going to college to get a de gee.‘
“A degree of what?” asks the ril-
liant person. “A degree of knowl-
edge, a degree of understanding of
ourselves,” is the right answer. The
true aim of a college education is
to educate the whole person. not
merely that fraction of a human be- —

ing which is known as the intellect.
