Democrat Milton J. Shapp be-
came the first Pennsylvania gov-
ernor in 99 years to succeed him-
self and Republican Senator Rich-

ard S. Schweiker survived a Dem-

ocratic onslaught in Tuesdays
election.

Shapp, a 62-year-old million-
aire electronics engineer, called

‘his 307,000-vote victory—carved

out of Democratic Philadelphia
and its normally Republican sub-
urbs—“a really great night for the
Democrats.” '

Shapp defeated Drew Lewis. a_

professional party politician.
making his first run for public of-
fice. but fell short of his 500.000-

’ vote landslide four years ago.

Schweiker won by 264000 over
Peter F. Flaherty. the Demo-
cratic mayor of Pittsburgh. sur-

passing his 222.000 majority of
1968.

Democrats parlayed Republican
scandals and gnawing inflation
into a landslide of off-year elec-
tion victories nationally, strength-
ening’their grip on Congress and
capturing the governorships of
New York, Massachusetts and
Connecticut.

President Ford conceded his
party had been trounced. "I have
accepted the verdict." the Presi-
dent said. “Those who lose often
come back to win another day."

The Democrats swept easily to
control of both Houses and Sen-
ate. and to increased margins in
both branches of the 94th Con-
gress.

.Drew Lewis, unknown to the
public when he started 16 months
ago, was consumed by the Water-
gate firestorm that wiped out a

score of state Republicans in the
state House and Senate.

He had centered his attack on
Shapp’s alleged tolerance of cor-
rupt p-ra_ctices. Shapp responded
with the accusation of “witch-
hunt.”

Shapp rolled to easy victory on
Democratic majorities in 13
key counties: Allegheny. Beaver.
Berks. Bucks. Cambria. Lacka-
wanna. Lehigh. Luzerne. North-
hampton. Philadelphia. Schuylkill.
Washington and Westmoreland.
He won by 395.000 in Philadel-
phia.

‘Lewis was admittedly disap-
pointed at his showing after pre-
dicting he’d win by 100,000.

"We still have a job ahead to
do." Lewis told a subdued group
of supporters. “We have a major

Panel Offers Tenure Changes CEEB Plans Revisions

mittee (EPC) offered suggestions
to correct “deﬁciencies of proced-
ure” in University tenure selection
at Monday's Senate Council meet-
ing.

The suggestions, presented in the
form of a five page critique,
out-lined proposed changes in the
Tenure Commission Report and its
policy proposals on tenure selec-
tion.

The EPC’s primary objections
were aimed against the Tenure
Commission’s proposed criteria for

‘ eration of both

appointment. The EPC noted the ‘

criteria implied a lesser concern for
excellence in the teaching mission
than for the scholarship or creative
arts mission in selection of tenure
candidates.

“Giving more weight to scholar-
ship instead of teaching in tenure-
selection is undesirable," said EPC
Chairman Sanford Golin. “The
de-emphasis of the teaching func-
tion in the Report could be a threat
to the quality of education."

The EPC further claimed consid-
teaching and
scholarship did not adequately take

Cross-examination Monday of
two high ranking Pitt officials at the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations

Board hearings concluded the
"administrative phase" of the
University's argument that all

faculty‘. university-side, should be
included in one collective bargain-
‘trig unit.

When the hearings resume next
Monday, the administration will
either present an academic argu-
ment -- why for the sake of Pitt’s
academic community -only one
bargaining unit should exist -- or

cross-examined in Monday’s
morning session, most notably by
counsels for the law and medical
schools.

into accound the diversity of the
University. '

‘‘It’s dubious whether the pro-
posed criteria can be realistically
applied to the branchpcampuses in
tenure decisions,” Golin said.

Chancellor Posvar praised both
the Tenure Commission and the
EPC for “presenting a very con-
structive step" in the improvement
of future tenure selections. He
urged a brief discussion of the
Report and the EPC's evaluation
among council members.

“Our goal is to correct current
selection practices by weighing the
opinion of everyone involved,"
“I would like input
from all faculty departments as
well as Senate committees.”

In response to the Chancellor’s
request for open discussion, coun-
cil member Allen Janis questioned
the feasibility of a large tenure
review board made up of students,
faculty members and administra-
tors, suggesting instead, that only
tenured faculty members be in-
cluded in the group. The review
board, proposed by the Tenure
Commission's report would make
the decision of accepting or re-
jecting tenure candidates.

Chairman of the Tenure and
Academic Freedom Committee,
William Brown defended the
Report’s proposal.

‘‘If only tenured faculty had input
on the Board, we’d have too much
of an inbreeding, or cloning
effect," Brown said. “As many
people as possible should have a.

The College Entrance Examina-
tion Board (CEEB) plans to revise
its standards to make it easier for
lower middle income students to
get financial aid, it was announced
at CEEB’s annual meeting in

Washington DC last week.

Dean of Admissions and Student
Aid Ken Wenger attended the
meeting and explained, “The
tables used by the College Scholar-
ship Service (CSS-part of CEEB)
have been drastically changed for
the ’75-’76 school year since pre-
vious years with a reduction in the

amount expected from parental
contributions. The tables used
before have not been fair to parents
in the expectancy of parental
contributions. The CSS will try to
be more realistic.

“It appears they will expect less
contributions from low and low
middle income fafnilies.
exact figures will not be known
until the tables are published.”

Wenger explained this revision
would require an additional $2
billion in aid money in the nation
with the amount varying from
college to college.

“It’s uncertain whether state or
federal government will come up

said.

of what they need. Other schools

plan to, give funds to the most
needy until the funds run out,

leaving nothing for the lesser

be analyzed to fit the needs of all
students.”

“We’re going to have to have
strong lobbying, no doubt about

Lung Problems Complicate

Pantherettes Charged with

‘Unprofessionial Sfanclarcls~’7*~

BY BILL MOORE

Marching Band members charged
the Pitt Pantherettes with “unpro-
fessional standards” during a con-
frontation with Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) members over
the’ band’s objections to allowing"
the Pantherettes to perform during
football game halftime programs.

SGB president Mike Furick and

llirepresentative Mary Heider stop-S
ped members of the band after ,

their Tuesday evening practice
session to ask them their specific
objections to the Pantherette or-
ganization.

“I would like to see some good
quality baton twirlers who would

Nixon's Post-Op Recovery

LONG BEACH, AP--Part of
Richard M. Nixon’s right lung has
collapsed and there was ﬂuid in his
left lung, his doctor said Tuesday.

Neither of the lung problems was
believed serious, and Dr. John C.
Lungren said he asked the former
president to cough and breathe
deeply to overcome them. Lungren
said he also had directed Nixon to

take more walks in his hospital
room. ,
Lungren said despite some im-
provements, _ the former president
remained in serious condition and
was “terribly physically weak.”
Medical reference books indicate
the lung problems are common,
usually not serious and apparently
are after-effects of the phlebitis
surgery Nixon underwent last
The books indicated that
coughing and breathing 'deeply
would help clear out fluids and
keep the lungs inﬂated and that"

march like a unit and look decent
it would be alright," band member
Bob_Wesling said. “You say we
should give them a chance but
they've been around for two years
and they haven't proven, them-
selves yet." '

An unidentified woman «band
member termed the Pantherettes
“rotten performers.” She said,
“the Pantherettes’ style does not
conform with the military style of
the band, and when they work their
routines around our music people

presume they are associated with

us.” I , ,

“We are the second best college
band in the nation and we don’t
need pretty legs to make us
better,” claimed one band member
who refused to give his name.

Furick questioned the band mem-
bers at the request of the Panther-
ette organization. “They are a
student organization funded by
student government and why do we
have the Pantherettes-if they aren’t
allowed to march? I think it is
about time we discussed this with
the band,” Furick said.

“I’m surprised with the number
of band members that were willing

to stop and talk about this after 5

practice. I think we have a
concensus of opinion that the
Pantherettes don’t meet the stan-
dard that the band wants them to
meet, but how can they when they
aren’t allowed to perform? Good
people won’t try out for the
Pantherettesif they aren’t allowed
to march on the field during
ames.”

Board member Heider said “the l

matter further at Wednesday’s
Board meeting.

page 4—frnE PITT NEWS?-Wednesday, November 6,1974

 Posvar’s Response

1  Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s response to the Black Action Society

 (BAS) in the form of a letter to the University community concerning
’" the appointment of a black studies department chairman failed to
answer the questions which have been raised by BAS and the Pitt ,

News, and neglected to state any explanation for the administration’s

_ non-decision on Curtiss Porter.

In his statement the Chancellor concluded FAS Dean Jerome
vRosenberg made the correct decision when he appointed CMU

 ’ Assistant Professor of History Roland Smith to the [Black Studies‘ post '
 ‘despite strong student sentiment for Porter.
. stated the selection of Smith over Porter was based upon the best
_ future interests of the black studies department.

Additionally, Posvar

The unequivocal implication, then, is. that the selection of Curtiss

- ‘Porter would not have been in the best future interests of the

department. And though the administration has continually afﬁrmed
this since the origin of the most recent controversy near the end of
— September, neither Rosenberg, Provost Rhoten Smith, or the
Chancellor will state why the selection of Porter would not be in the
best interests of the department, since he has been found eminently
qualiﬁed by the administration-appointed search committee.

Is it possible, then, hat the administration has determined Porter is
incompetent to ﬁll the post? ls Porter being rejected because he does
not presently have a PhD? ls Porter being rejected because he is not a

  good teacher or a good scholar? ls Porter being rejected because of his
‘  activist involvement in the black movement at Pitt? Or is Porter
I being rejected because of a personality conﬂict with Rosenberg? Has

Porter failed in some area that makes him unﬁt for the job?
The administration has contended a release of the reasons for their

 decision would unfairly affect the future of Curtiss Porter, and that it is
not appropriate to publicly attack Porter. The Black Action Society and

the Pitt News have not petitioned for a public rebuke of one Girtiss
Porter. Rather, we have asked to learn the reasons the

I administration--in its inﬁnite wisdom-.-found it impossible to appoint a

man overwhelmingly recommended for the post.

Porter, himself, has not been informed of the reasons for his rejection,
and not only is he entitled to an explanation, but he is willing to subject
himself to that which the administration claims would irreparably
damage his/career. ,

In a letter, which was originally to be directed to BAS, Posvar agreed

 » the incident has aroused serious tensions in the community and said
_ the incident has been exaggerated in the public media. Obviously,

however, the Chancellor, himself, has recognized the gravity of this
crisis by agreeing to meet with black students to discuss the issue and
also to review Rosenberg's decision. Additionally, if black students
felt compelled to initiate a protest in the Chancellor’s ofﬁce to
dramatize their concerns and get the attention of the administration,
then, the situation is indeed very serious, and requires the immediate
attention of the University community.

We, as one segment of the public media, are satisﬁed the controversy

I over the Black Studies chairmanship has been reported, analyzed, and
: commented on with distinction and fairness to all involved. In no way

has the Pitt News exaggerated this problem. Furthermore, we cannot

W " . help but add that had the administration been aware of the student
"  concern on thissubject, which we discussed in September, they could
. ‘T have avoided the entire situation by explaining then, the reasons for

- their administrative decision on Curtiss Porter.

 Coerce and Intimidate

The Chancellor’s letter adds the decision making processes on a black
studies department chairman will continue and that “any resort to
intimidation or coercion, should it occur, would be ﬁrmly opposed."
We don't know whether to laugh or cry at such an inappropriate
statement. Never have students concerned with this issue attempted

. I I . to either coerce or intimidate the administration. Rather, we have

asked to have input into the decision-making processes, which we are

I entitled to as members of the University community. And let's face the

facts--if anyone has been intimidated, it's been those students who

 have tried endlessly to participate in the selection process.

And if this is the Chancellor’s perception of the current crisis then he

has not been observing the same situation. Students have been trying

to participate in the system and receive an explanation for the

I administration’s appointment not through violence or coercion. In fact,

black students resorted to the confrontation a few weeks ago only when

Q  it became apparent Pitt administrators were not interested in their
' - grievances. How can the Chancellor, then, who is obviously unaware

of the problem, resolve it appropriately.
‘ The Black Action Society (BAS) responded to the Chancellor’s letter

I labeling it a non-response. Indeed it did fail to satisfactorily ease the

students’ concerns, but BAS has once again petitioned the Chancellor
to meet in an informal atmosphere in order to bridge the obvious
communication gap. - We trust the Chancellor will not fail to meet with

the students, so he can once again orient himself to the real world.
And what happens now? Curtiss Porter is the only candidate deemed
qualiﬁed by the adrninistration’s search committee who is still willing
to serve in the post. The Chancellor has said all qualiﬁed candidates
are still under consideration and the decision-making process will
continue. Thus, will Curtiss Porter be named chaimian of the black
studies department? Or will a new search committee be appointed to
begin the decision-making processes anew? If the administration
decides to appoint another search committee, it will be another
rejection of Curtiss Porter, a man the administration still claims is
being considered for the position. .
This would further damage a program which has already’ suffered
through a year without a chairman, plagued by a"/factionalism which
makes learning practically impossible. And quite clearly‘ if another
search committee is to be appointed, students will once again expect a
complete and candid explanation from the administration as to why
Porter could not be named chairman and why the search process for the
best qualiﬁed chairperson of the black studies department must be
renewed. ' '

An Invitation  

We are convinced the administration must explain its reasons for the
rejection of Curtiss Porter for this situation to ,be resolved. The Pitt
News is the best available medium for conveying this infomiation, and
as part of its responsibility to the University community, we would like
to formally invite either Chancellor Posvar, Provost Rhoten Smith, or
FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg, who are involved in the Black Studies

chairmanship issue, to publicly explain the !reasons for the
non-decision on Curtiss Porter.

On November 8, the Pitt News will alot one quarter of its editorial
page for this response or non-response.

Mills:

  Man ‘

BY RON clcnowlcz

There‘s a great deal of speculation
regarding the next Presidential
election. Everyone is looking for
the ideal candidate, the true repre-
sentative of the people. Some look
to the cool leadership of Ted
Kennedy. Some like the steady,
conservative guidance of Jerry
Ford. But ' most citizens are
disenchanted with all the front-
runners, since they ﬁnd it_hard to
identity with any of them.

But we now have such a man. His
name is Wilbur Mills.

Wilbur Mills wasn’t always the
champion of the common man. Oh
no. As a matter of fact, just a few
short weeks ago, Wilbur Mills was
one of the more untouchable Capi-
tol Hill gods. His sceptre of power
controlled the House Ways and
Means Committee, which made
him one of the more-dominant
dieties.

But all that has changed. A few
weeks ago, Mills literally staggered
off his throne, and into the arms of
He was.
followed by a water nymph, Anna-
bel Battistella, better known as

cracker. (She must have been a
water nymph, because as soon as
Mills’. car stopped, the Firecracker
extinguished herself in the Tidal
Basin.) Mills was reported to have
been smelling of'nectar, and his
royal countenance was scratched
and "bleeding. That’s right. bleed-
ing. Real blood.

it.

So, what all this means is that, 
the common man finally has a“w-.-~,=5

representative. He drinks, he rides
around with friendly women, and
he even gets arrested. He’s one of
us.

Unfortunately, that’s probably
why Mills will get re-elected. Mere
mortals never get elected;

‘ Pitt’s Student Code of Conduct

i_','pi'§otective of the rights of students,
‘according to Alden Bowen. Coor-
ldinator.
*?_'“‘VWhen you go through the judi-
’cial process,” Bowen said,

.. 1..., 

Coordinator of Campus Judicial
‘Systems Alden Bowen talks about
__ the new Student Code of Conduct.

" .“There’s a chance to tell your side
of the story.”

_ Tom Doman, Chairperson of the
_Legal Awareness Committee also
 favors the code. “It’s a good
£_ .-‘system. We were invited by Bowen
to revise the Student Code of
Conduct," Doman said. “We had
 our say as to what went down."

' “What went down" are enact-

.._'7'and Judicial procedures is very"

    

ments insuring students’ rights
against any arbitrary and unfair
handling of their cases. Bowen
pointed to four areas thegcode
covers:

1. It's a statement of rights setting
forth University regulations in a
non-academic area," Bowen said. '

2. According to Bowen, it’s a
University's responsibility to en-
force the student code to protect
against students’ harming other
students. The code tried to pre-
scribe “what the balance of re-
sponsibility is between the stu-
dents and the University."

3. "The whole process of the CJB
(Campus Judicial Board) is a
mini—eourt system." Bowen said.
“On the CJB I sit as -judge; the
Board hears the complaints of
students against other students;
the accused student may be repre-
sented by cousel." he said.

4. Bowen said there's an appellate
system, the University Review
Board (URB), which he compared
to the appellate court system. ie it
has the power to overturn cases
and alter sanctions imposed by the
CJB.

“Student representatives, faculty
members and administration peo-
ple all had a say in the writing of
the Student Code of conduct,"
Bowen said.

“Despite this input there are
weaknesses in the code according
to Legal Awareness Chairperson

A Student Code Explained

Doman.

“It used to be that the Board
decided if they had enough evi-
dence to go to trial. Now Bowen,
who is the coordinator. makes that
decision,“ Doman said.

[Doman was referring to section
10 under the heading “Hearing
Format” in the Student Code of
Conduct. It reads: “Depending
upon the determination of the
coordinator, the matter shall be
dismissed or the accused shall be
called upon to present his/ her case
and offer evidence in support
thereof.”]

Calling it a conflict of interests.
Doman said. “Bowen is in a
precarious position; the moderator
of the Board should not be in a
position to make that decision."

Bowen, however, sees no conflict
of interest. “A judge makes the
same kind of decisions," he said.
“There are questions which must
be answered at that time.
“Students are. not capable of
answering them. I took that [pow-
er] away from them,” Bowen said.

Doman suggested a proposal to
remove this power from Bowen.
Doman would like to «see a “third
university council (apart from CJB
and U'RB) to decide" whether there
is sufficient evidence for trial.

“I would like to se a disinterested
third party in there to__ make that
decision." Doman said.

' necessary one.

BY PETER CAPELL

“Big Brother" is a program
designed for fatherless boys
between eight and lo. ln a vain
attempt to say something pro-
found, all one can say is the
organization is necessary and
important. The reasons why are
self-evident.

The folks contacted at Big
Brothers of Allegheny ‘County
headquarters. across the Sixth
Street Bridge from downtown, are
eager for more student activity in
their program.

To get involved just lift the
receiver of any telephone and dial
231-7400. After this point. the
participant will be asked to visit the
center. fill out an application and
join in a short interview. No big
thing!_ At this point it‘s decided
whether the applicant can spare a
reasonable amount of time for the
little brother. The participant is
also made fully aware of the trip
upon which he is about to embark.

Two more interviews are arranged
before coming in contact with the
little brother. After it has been
agreed that the applicant is going
to be a “Big Brother," he will be
asked to meet with the staffers at
the center, for a more in depth
interview. This is the clincher. It
decides whether the applicant, on
the whole, is suitable for participa-
tion in the program.

This may seem like a personal
invasion from Big Brother, but a
Being a “Big
Brother" is a large responsibility,

Brothers for Fatherless Boys

for all of the parties involved.

We're dealing with the ultimate 

resource, a type of gem...people.
The last meeting is brief. as far as
the program is concerned however,
the Big Brother can meet with the
mother of the child-person, before
meeting directly.

Using words like restriction and
requirement is unfortunate, but
there are some. First the
requirements: anyone who wishes
to become involved thinks in terms
ofa year, or more. because it would
be cruel to either party to get into a
relationship for six months, then
force a separation. One visita
week is stressed, but there are no
fines, punishment or
administered by the center when
someone misses a week._ It is
polite, however, to call the little
brother to warn him of the absence.

The only restrictions are they
(HQ) cannot accept an application
from someone with a criminal
reco'rd less than a year old, and
depending on the crime. Age is the
only other factor. Twenty is the
age preferred. although 18 and 19
year olds may be considered.

The program tries to keep Big
Brothers and little brothers within
a 15-minute ride from each other.
If the Big Brother does not own a

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

Two junkies sit in Western Peni-
tentiary, one of them nodding from
the dope, the other aching for a ﬁx.

“Hey Billy! Man, whats happ’en.
Wow! that stuff Bob got is al-
rightttt-t!” says Mellow.

“O-yea! Man I need some stuff
bad man, real bad,” says Billy. He
starts to rise expectantly. “Mellow,
give me a pinch, take me with you
-- just ’til I get myself together,
OK?”

But the Western Penn guards
aren’t doing anything about it! It’s

txjust Speech 21, Introduction to

Theatre, part of Pitt’s program
inside the prison to enable inmates
to obtain a degree before they are
once again plunged into society.
Mellowand Billy are really Tom
and John, and they’re completely
straight. But, it’s,hard to tell by
watching. The expressions and
voices are intense, not theatrical.
The director, William, a tall black
inmate in regulation faded purplish
pants, a white tee shirt, brown wool
vest and khaki fisherman’s hat,
interrupts the action: '
“No, Mel1ow’s still standing, you

_ dig?”

The actors begin again. It’s
William’s play, and he insists on
perfection, stage directions and all.
This is only the second reading of
his play, but all ten of the class
members present are involved,
attentive. They run through the
script again.

The ﬁnal scene ends with Billy on
the floor, cradling the head of a

mrxyoung brother who has just died

from an injection of heroin, crying
and rocking, crying and rocking,

head hung low, “I told him, I told .

him, I told him.” They’re hamming
now, and the guys break into
laughter, all but William. He is
proud of his play and he takes it,
like the Black Studies major he is
working at, very seriously.

‘_‘You guys aren't putting any
feeling into it,” says Frank Serrao.

iTechnically, he's the teacher. A

  

Pitt Theatre Arts graduate current-
ly a fellowship candidate for an MA
in that department, he feels there
is an abundance of talent among
the inmates and it is a major part of
his responsibility to direct it, and to
provide anoutlet. His comment is
more a suggestion than a rebuke,’
and discussion bursts out immedi-
ately. There is no trace of under-
graduate shyness or apathy here.

The majority of the class is black,
as is the play’s author, and the talk
is jive. Serrao doesn’t understand
“...Billy took a big sting off...”

“No, man, people understand
that,” argues Fred, a thin 22 year
old with a large afro, who has been
in prison since he was 18. “Sting...
they even made a movie...burg-
lary, man, it’s what we’re all in
here for.”

They laugh wryly, wordlessly
acknowledging the gap which sep-
arates them so absolutely from Pitt
students taking Speech 21 at the
Oakland campus. The gap is peo-

‘p-led with ranks of stereotypically
hard-looking guards manning met-
al detectors, searching visitors,
clanging the rows of studded,
screened, or barred metal doors.
The gap is impossible for the
inmates to cross, and very nearly
impossible for those on the outside.

Endless red tape, approval from-

countless officials, and scores of
release forms faced Serrao’s initi-
ation of the course in the prison‘. He
began by teaching an acting work-
shop with Trudy Scott from the
Allegheny Community College last
term, under approval and guidance

' by CAS Dean Robert Marshall and

Theatre Arts Coordinator Attilio
Favorini. Encouraged by inmate
response to the program, he is
determined to continue his efforts.

“We really feel that we’re a facet
of the University, although a lot of
people there would rather just
ignore us,” said Igor, another 21

 

through theatre behind bars.

year old inmate, a former student
at the University of Detroit. “We
probably read the Pitt News here
more than most of the people on
campus. ‘
“Actually, we read more than

' most people. We don’t have the

distractions that people out on the
street have, like’ partying, other
things to do. Prison never rehabili-
tated any man, but in here you’ve
got to put your own program
together, find your own ‘direction.
A lot of people out there don’t have
any direction, they don’t know
where they’re going.”

Most of the class agreed the
college program ,in which they are
enrolled serves as a strong boost to
the hope for release and a new life
which keeps prisoners going. How-
ever, in the theatre arts courses,
evidence of success is tangible
now. »

BY ARNIE GREENWALD

. A mortuary school certainly has
alot of comic potential for one
.. inclined toward black humor; but.
‘as William J. Musmanno, Dean of
i“ the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortu-
-:~ary Science (PIMS) and a few
students pointed out, it is a serious
business.

..-The school is located at 3337
Forbes Avenue in Oakland. The
entrance area looks much like a
typical doctors office. Spotless tilé
floor, indirect flourescent lighting,
‘and, of course, muzak. Enrolled in
the program are about 100 male
and female students from all over
the country. According to Dean
Musmanno, a Pitt alumnus, there
are only 22 schools of this nature in
the United States.

I In order to embalm a body in
Pennsylvania. a person must have,
among other credentials, a 12
month course in a mortuary school
such as PIMS: To be accepted
PIMS requires a C average for 60
semester hours of general college
‘credits. After completing the PIMS

year internship and pass the State
Board Examination, before he can

 

age 8-‘—TIIE PITT NEWS—I‘-Wednesday, November 6, 1974 I

training, one has to serve "a one-

embalm a body in the state.

The program at PIMS takes one
year and consists of classroom work
as well as extensive laboratory
experience. The classroom instruc-
tion is divided into five separate
areas: Basic Sciences, Public
Health Sciences, Mortuary Admin-
istration, Mortuary Arts and
Sciences. and other general
courses required for graduation.
Classes are held from 8 am - 1:30
pm. After classes there is lab work .
when bodies are available. PIMS
embalms charity cases and bodies
that are not immediately claimed at
the Allegheny County Morgue.

Bodies embalmed at the school
are embalmed in the preparation
room. In the middle of the room are
two white tables which hold the
bodies while they are being
embalmed. Chemicals line the
shelves. In the corner is a
sterilizing machine.

Susie Brown, a student at PIMS
from Tidioute, PA, told of the
normal procedures followed when a
body is embalmed at the Allegheny
County Morgue. The bodies are
kept in a cooler wrapped either in a
sheet or plastic. The students roll

the bodies out on the cart on which
they are stored, place the body on a
table, and then perform the
embalming procedure.

Dave Yeropoli, another student at
PIMS. explained that the dead are
quite different in appearance from
sleeping people. “A caucasian‘s
color changes to an ashen gray."

The Basic and Public Health
Sciences taught at PIMS are
anatomy, chemistry, microbiology,
pathology, pharmacology, and tox-
icology. Students areprepared for
owning their own funeral parlor by
the Mortuary Administration part
of the curriculum. There is also
instruction in the psychology of
grief.

The Mortuary Arts and Sciences
Department teaches courses in
Embalming and Restorative Art.
In the lab corresponding with
Restorative_Art 13, “the student
applies the basic principles of
proportion, size, and shape of the
individual features of the face to
practical work with restorative wax,
learning to recreate all of the facial
features systematically until he can
reproduce the entire head."

On one of the walls of this lab _

room hang about 15 metal skulls
used by the students to practice
shaping facial features. Dave
Yeropoli explained that the mortic-
ian tries to recreate a memory
picture. one that restores the
deceased to lifelike quality without
making him look like Robert
Redford.

There is a lawyer on the faculty
who instructs the students on the
aspects of law dealing with the
dead.

Most of thestudents at PIMS have
had some prior experience in the
mortuary ﬁeld. Some are sons and
daughters of funeral directors.
Most of the others have friends or
relatives in the business.

Brown is an exception to this
generalization having had only
personal family experience with

death. Yeropoli worked two years
in a funeral parlor in his hometown
of Campbell, Ohio, before he came
to PIMS.

“I think working around death a
lot conditions you to it, but it never _
really hardens you,” Yeropoli said.
“Knowing that you’re helping_
people when they need it the most
inﬂuenced Yeropoli’s decision _to
enter the profession.

Dave advised people to find out
first hand about the funeral
business before making any judge-
ments.

. Pharoah’s Art: ()akland’s Mortuary School

Dean Musmanno stated that most
of the people who apply and meet
the requirements are accepted at
PIMS. The job market is good,
states Musmanno, and a student
passing the State Board Examina-
tion can expect to start at a salary
of about $700 a month.

Dean Musmanno, who is also the
Western Pennsylvania representa-
tive for the — Humanities Gift
Registry which ,handles bodies
donated to medicine, stressed that
in all fields of medicine, a strict
code of ethics is followed by
morticians.

tremes--as portrayed by probably
the best book on the controversial
comedian to date, Ladies and
Gentlemen--Lenny Brucell /

There are probably more than a
few peach-cheeked youths out
there who are wondering “just who
the heck is Lenny Bruce?” Was.
The man died August 3, 1966,
allegedly from an overdose of
narcotics, after years of court
battles that reduced him from one
of the brightest, most highly paid
comics to an embittered pauper
who more than occasionally bor-
dered on insanity.

His followers said he was being

persecuted for his hard-hitting“

satire on government, organized
religion and other sacred cows, up
to and including the , nation’s
reigning saint, Jacqueline ‘Ken-
nedy. To his critics, he was a
no-talent who got’ his laughs from
the sensational use of every dirty
word in the book, and was usually
too doped out to make any sense in‘
his long,’ rambling monlogues.

He was both savior and sinner,
and is the man directly responsible
for the “freeing” of the English
language on state, without whom
we could never have George Carlin,
Hair, Cheech and Chong, and the
range of X-rated ﬂicks freely
distributed and shown. His ob-
scenity trials made headlines, if not

.always precedence‘, and untied the

Puritan hold on the definition of

“obscene" that said love was dirty, .

and violence was clean.
Part of Lenny’s shtick was that he

,was pushing a “what is” world

instead pf a “what should be”

world. The latest book by Albert».

Goldman (from the journalism,

meaning research, of Lawrence
Schiller) points out Lenny -had his
fantasies just like everybody else.
For example, Lenny.was not the
tough slum kid he wanted to be.
Rather, he had a drab, unexciting
middle class upbringing in a com-
fortable, Long Island home.

But more to the heart of the
matter, was Lenny’s life-long refu-
sal to face his drug addiction. In his
autobiography How To Talk Dirty
and Inﬂuence People [a fine piece
of fiction], be repeatedly denies
that he is addicted to drugs. In
print and on the stage he avoided
the subject, but spent a great part
of his real life trying to score and
avoid narcs.

Ladies and Gentlemen... faces
the situation, all right, but not like
somany detracting films and books
in the past. This is Lenny’s biggest
lie, and Goldman & Co. have the
sense not to act like outraged
children who discover father is not
a superman. In fact, all of Bruce’s
many faults are dealt with maturely

and with understanding, and they
are not allowed to brush aside the
man's genius. ‘

‘The book has an interesting
structure, opening with a “day in
the life” reconstruction, a near-
verbatim monologue of Honey

Bruce’s half of a rare interview;_

and a chapter on Lenny’s maligned
father, creating a sound picture of
the title ﬁgure, before going into a
chronological biography colloloqui-
ally written and never dull.

That biography should surprise a

lot of Bruce fanatics who weren’t -

aware of the real early life of Bruce.
One major revelation is that Len-
ny’s unique “spritz” "style of
delivery was not original, but
derived from a crony, Joe Ancis,
who never made it on the stage nor
ever received due recognition from
his protege. A

The book deals with Bruce both as
comic genius -and messed-up hu-
man, who aimed his satire at just

Heinz Hall Performance Friday

A Fresh Wilcox En/ivens Opera

BY JESS M. BRALLIER
Arts Editor

“What are those dates againi’...
oh. January 25. 26 and 27. That's in
'70. right‘? OK, except I'm
scheduled for something in Denver
on the 25th." So typifies the
youthful, constant energy of Carol
Wilcox. Metropolitan soprano...
scheduled dates into 1970.

Carol comfortably seats herself,
no act. no show, rehearsal's over
and she's relaxed. Very attractive,
young and radiating. not at all
reminiscent of a Hollywood's aged,
boisterous and mammoth opera
soprano.

The Heinz Hall rehearsal room is
modern, bright with plastic chairs
and wall to wall carpet. As modern
as this room is, so is Carol. She’s a
new breed, a comfortable breed...
young and on the move. “It’s like a
quarterback, there’s always some-
body after my job. I can’t quit or
that somebody willjump right in, I
give and give, yeah, maybe I am
selling myself. Yeah, that may be
it...I’m unique. I’m the only one
who can interpret a role in the
Wilcox style. I’m the only one with
the Wilcox voice. I’m the only Carol
Wilcox and it’s unique and
worthwhile...it’s me.”

Wilcox is in Pittsburgh to
perform, in English, Donizetti’s
Daughter of the Regiment. It's a
special performance for students
only. But the rehearsal Carol just
completed lacked an odd attitude, a
“well, it's only students" attitude.
That‘s not the way of the new
breed, they give their best, and all

, the time.

“I’m right for opera today, it’s
different. Instead of 99% musical
and 1% theatre, opera’s now 65%
musical. I never sang or read opera
until late in college. Sure, I did all
the major musicals in high school
and college. But when I first heard
opera, I liked it, so I worked and

worked, learned my music, learned
my history and now I’m singing
it.” .

Carol grew up in Kansas,
grabbing the lead in all her high
school's musicals. Much the same
happened at the University of
Kansas, after which she began
graduate school at Manhattan in
New York. never planning to
finish...just to be in New York,
waiting for, then jumping at the
chance for a job with the Met. The
rest is history.

“Why opera? Well, because it’s
the ultimate. the combination of all
the performing arts...the dramatic

“Majors, who started for the Vols
as an All-American halfback in the
1950’s, was not “pleased that the
iifrnors were started and some
were_ taking them seriously.
‘I'll probably go back to
Tennessee for Christmas vacation

Majors laughed, “but that’s about

'-Tennessee fans are irate over
Battle"-’s 3-3-1 record so, far this

Majors said. “I'm not going

AP Sports Writer

Ohio State and Oklahoma contin-
ue to run 1-2 in The Associated
Press college footbal rankings this

week but Alabama pulled ahead of

Michigan into third place while
Texas A&M and Florida showed
signiﬁcant gains. 6

The Buckeyes of Ohio State
received 49 first-place votes and
1,212 of a possible 1,240 points
from a nationwide panel of sports
writers and broadcasters following
their eighth consecutive triumph, a
49-7 whipping of Illinois.

Meanwhile, 7-0 Oklahoma turned
back Iowa State 28-10 and received
10 ﬁrst-place ballots and .1,090
points. Ohio State's margin last
week, was 1,222-1,123.

Alabama put on an impressive
performance in trouncing Missis-

hard one for Ridl & Co.

Practices began two and a half
weeks ago and since then the 19
candidates have been subjected to
long hours of conditioning, instruc-
tion, and intrasquad playing
experience. One of the most
important things that the candi-
dates have had to do is learn how to
play team defense.

“Good team defense is‘thc most
unnatural thing for a basketball
player,” says Ridl. “We split the
players up for instruction and Fran
Webster teaches them how to play
the type of defense we like to run.”

The so-called amoeba defense,
an invention of Webster's, is
merely switching off the zone and
man-for-man coverage so that the
opposition does .not have time to
diagnose the defense and attack its
weakness. ‘ '

fourth to third, trading placed with
Michigan, which was hard-pressed
to beat Indiana 21-7. Alabama
received two first-place votes and
918 points while Michigan got the
other first-place vote and 850
points. ‘

Texas A&M, eights the‘ last three

weeks, climed to ﬁfth by defeating
Arkansas 20-10. Auburn, which
had been‘, ﬁfth » for three weks,
slipped to 10th following its first
defeat of the year, a 25-14 loss to
Florida which lifted the Gators
from 11th to sixth.

Southern California, which had
been sixth, skidded to 11th after
being held to a 15-15 deadlock by
California.

Penn State defeated Maryland,

. Pitt-Penn State Game Plan Finalized    
    Thanksgiviving Night
At 3 Rivers Stadium,

The game had originally been
scheduled for November 23 but was
switched after ABC deliberated
several weeks, waiting to check the
respective records of both teams in

accordance to to a prospective,

audience appeal. The contest will
be held at Three Rivers because
Pitt Stadium does not have ade-
quate lighting for nightftelevision
broadcast. '

' National television exposure will
bring $244,000 to each school. Pitt

. was last on national television back

in 1964, but was featured in a
regional broadcast in 41965.

“It was worth -' waiting for,”
athletic director Casmir Myslinski
said at the weekly press luncheon.
“We are very happy to be given the

’ exposure.”

The long awaited decision by ABC
might have been the highlight -of
the day, but coach Johnny Majors
had other things on his mind,
primarily the evaluation of his
squad’s efforts against Syracuse
last wekend and the arival of the
once beaten Temple Owls this
weekend.

“Enthusiasm is running very high
on our squad,” Majors said, “and
I’m certainly very happy to see us

get national exposure. But right

now I’m concerned only with

keeping our concentration right on

the bull’s eye and that is Temple.
“The next three weeks of the

season are very critical,” Majors

continued, “and I’m only con-
cerned with the improvement of
our football team and increasing

A our enthusiasm. I'm convinced we A
have a team that doesn’t want to

remain static.” _ I
The Panthers will take a four
game winning v streak into the
homecoming tilt with the Temple
Owls, plus a berth in the nation’s
top twenty teams of both wire
services. Pitt was ranked 14 by UPI
and tied for 19th in the AP poll.
Coming off a_ 21-13 win over a
sometimes belittled Syracuse
Orange squad, Majors expressed
satisfaction with the Cats perfor-
mance despite the score. .

six returning lettermen from last
year's team. Kirk Bruce, Jim Bolla,
Keith Starr. Tom Richards, Lew
Hill. and Willie Kelly all played for
the Panthers last year, but they will
have to work hard to retain their
positions.

“The six returning lettermen by
no means inherit their positions
automatically. They are being

challenged for their positions

strongly by the likes of Wayne

' Talbot, Melvin Bennet, and junior

college transfer Ralph McClel-
land.” -

Talbot, Bennet, and McClelland
have all shown remarkable re-

bounding and jumping ability,
something that Pitt is going to need
a lot of this season.

“We're not as strong shooting,
percentage-wise," says Ridl, “and
we're going to have to make up for
that by getting the ball more and
being able to follow up more on
missed shots. We might also have
to go more to those 20 and

25 foot long arching shots by

Richards."

Richards is just one of a slew of
guards on the Pitt team. Frank
Boyd and Scott Nedrow will be
after Richards’, Starr’s, and
Bruce’s jobs. Freshman Terry
Knight will also get a crack at the
position, although with such great
depth in one position, it is more
than likely that Knight will spend
his first year at Pitt on the junior
varsity squad.

Therepis also plenty of height at

“Syracuse doesn't have an out-
standing team,” Majors stated.
“They don't have any outstanding
all-american prospects or all East
prospects, but they were ready for
use. L

“We realized a lot was at stake
and we knew Syracuse was going to
have a good game,” Majors said.
“They showed as a few different
formations and came right at us,
but our enthusiasm was better than
any point of the season.”

Majors ran down his usual Tues-
day list of players who graded well

‘against the Orange and the names

he mentioned seemed to be as
recurrent as Majors’ cautiousness.
Gary Burley had 10 tackles from his
middle guard position and his
chances for an Outland Trophy,

awarded to the best lineman in the

nation, increase weekly.
Monster back Mike Bulino, who

has been sidelined since the South-
ern Cal game after breaking a bone
in his right ankle, should be ready

to see some action against Temple, .

but Majors will not make a final
decision until after the wek',s
practices.

The same goes for fullback Dave
Janasek, who has been out for four
weks after an infection ballooned
his foot overnight before the West

. Virginia game. Janasek, a senior,

will be practicing at full tilt for the
first time this week.

Bob Hutton, who replaced Jana-
sek on moments notice, ran well
against Syracuse and, along with
frosh tailback Elliot Walker, drew
Majors’ praise for their respective
performances under pressure.

“When your number's called, you
have to be ready," Majors said.
“I'm pretty pleased with the way
these two have played for being a
sophomore (Hutton) and a fresh-
man (Walker).

Offensive coordinator George
Haffner credits the running of
Hutton at the fullback spot has
revitalized the inside fake on the
option, making the outside sweep
all the more efficient. Haffner also
praised the efforst of the whole

‘ offensive unit.

“This year more than ever before
we have had to make the long
drive," Haffner said. “At Syra-
cuse, we had drives of 95, 68 and 62
yards. We were consistent, we
made the third down plays and
didn't miss many assignments."

Tony Dorsett sustained a sprained
ankle in that game and will not
practice this week. His status for
Saturday is still up in the air, but
Dorsett should be ready. Defensive
tackle Don Parrish, who like Dor-
sett was also sportingan ankle cast

‘early in the week, will lay off the

hitting during the week but is
expected to be ready for Temple.

since then has shared time with
Elliot Walker.

The offense has been fired up
since Hutton’s promotion, although
he modestly points out the
maturation of the offensive line has
more to do with it.

“The offense got off to a slow
start this year, but the (offensive)
line has really come around. We
moved the ball well against

I Syracuse and we’ve got to hope for

the same against Temple."

Ah, Temple. Suddenly everyone
in the East is wary of the Owls, and
not without reason. Wayne Hardin
has produced a winner, and had
hopes of bringing an undefeated
team to Pittsburgh. Those dreams
were shattered last Saturday on a
Cincinnati field goal in the last few
seconds. ,

Hutton says the team is already
psyched up for the Owls. The
feeling is reciprocated. “Their loss
to Cincinnati should fire them up
even more. They are a very tough,
very emotional team, but we'll be
ready for them.”

Should Janasek’s foot heal in time
for the fracas Saturday, Hutton
might find himself on the bench,
but there is absolutely no hint of
resentment. I

“Dave’s a really good fuIlback,”
he said, “and I can learn from
him.”

BOB HUTTON, 44, may do a lot of blocking for quarterback Bill

Daniels, 7, but last week he found himself running the ball and doing it

quite well against Syracuse.

In any case, John Majors has a
fullback ready to block for the more
publicized kid in the backfield. If
it's Bobby. Hutton, at least people
will know it now.

 Shutt Leads Habs’ Win

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

After Steve Shutt enjoyed a good
Stanley Cup playoff series against
the New York Rangers last spring,
the feeling was that the 22-year-old
left wing would be a superstar for
the Montreal Canadiens this year.

But Shutt reported to training
camp well over his playing weight
and Coach Scotty Bowman was not
pleased. In the’ early part of the
1974-75 National Hockey League
season, Shutt has found himself

.~<-.~ riding the bench.
'‘ Monday night, Shutt saw his first
' regular action of the year and
responded with two goals and an
assist in Montreal's 6-1 triumph
I over the.Minnesota North Stars.

“I needed a night like this to get
ime back on the track” said Shutt,
Montreal’s top amateur draft

. choice in 1971.

It was the only NHL game
scheduled Monday night. In the
only World Hockey Association
contest, the Quebec Nordiques
dropped the Toronto Toros 5-3.

Jacques Lemaire, Serge Savard,
Henri Richard and Guy Lapointe
scored the other Canadien goals,
while Minnesota’s Lou Nanne
ruined Ken Dryden’s shutout bid in
the third period.

It was the second big loss in "as
many nights for the North Stars,
who were crushed 10-1 by the
Boston Bruins Sunday and held to
just 18 shots by Montreal. Nanne
scored while he wasn’t even look-

._ ing at the puck; Fred Stanf1eld’s
 shot deflected off his stick while

Nanne’s back was turned.

Lions Vote To Accept Bid

STATE COLLEGE, PA - AP
Penn State’s football team has

vo_ted to accept an invitation to the.

New Year’s Day Cotton Bowl if an
invitation is extended.

Coach Joe Paterno and his squad
met Monday and decided to return
to dallas against the winner of the
Southwest Conference Champion-
ship — Texas A&M, Texas or
Baylor.

The Nittany Lions appeared in the
1972 Cotton Bowl and upset Texas
30-6. '

In bowl competition since A the
Lions’ first trip to the Rose Bowl in
1923, Penn State is 7-3-2.

Under Paterno, State has won
four, lost one and tied one in post
season play.

State’s first trip to a bowl under
Paterno was 1967, when the Lions

State had scored

tied Florida State in the Gator

In 1969, Paterno took his team for
the first of three Orange Bowl
games, defeating Kansas 15-14 in

seconds and got a second chance at
the sinning two-point conversion
when Kansas was detected with 12
men on the field on the first try.

The following year, State returned
to Miami and defeated Missouri
10-3 in the 1970 Orange Bowl.

Two years later, in 1972, State
went to the Sugar Bowl and lost to
powerful Oklahoma 14-0. Star run-
ning back John Cappelletti took
sick the afternoon of the game and
was unable to play. .

Book in Review

The Real Lenny Bruce

(Continued from Page 10)
about every target imaginable,
including many that rarely get into
print. Goldman also avoids the
surrealism often used when writing
about Bruce in the “migod-it’s-
really-happening-here” vein about
the repeated arrests--more than
once trumped up--and the unreal
pain of persecution. .« —

Goldman doesn’t set, out to knock
Bruce down to size, although he
does manage to bring him down to
"human proportions. He also has

"Interestingly, Goldman also has a
few choice words for the heralded
play Lenny (to be released next
month as a movie starring Dustin
Hoffman) which he terms a “musi-
cal comedy” copout. That play was
part of the “what should be" world
of Lenny Bruce. . V

help you understand the man and
his philosophies with a greater

  Art Just Might Be A
Dog's World...Oh Well  

Oh well, Elliott McDonaId’s 6 year
old Afghan hound won a top award
at the mid-Mississippi Art Compe-
tition. The art piece was an old
mitten he chewed up...oh well.
The work entered under the dog’s
name, Alexis Boyar, was described
as a “small ﬁber wall hanging in
off-white, with a range of interest-
ing textures.” /McDonald is sorry
that some people were upset and
insulted, but as she said, “that’s
art.” Oh well, room here for

thought. A bit scarey. McDonald
said she would return the $50 prize
to the donors. Oh weII...a mis-
behaved dog for the world’s frus-
trated artists.
