On'November 15, four false

alarms have been pulled in Pitt

was the responsibility of the

Weiss said in response that it
was the responsibility of the
candidates to determine where the
poll would be. He cited Article 1.
Section 3 of the Student Govern-
ment Election Committee By-Laws.

_~w_hich states: “It is the responsi-
“bility of the candidatesto ascertain

the locations (of the polling
place).”

Cohen said that he then asked
Weiss if he would now ﬁle charges
against the other candidates, whom
Cohen maintained had also been in
violation of the election code.

Weiss refused again, because he.

felt that ‘Cohen was able to ﬁle
charges himself.

On Nov. 12, the Election
Committee decided that the defen-
dants should make a public apology
for their violations. Gaskins and
Kloss’ apology appeared in the
Monday, Nov. 17 Pitt News.

  TRAININGAVAILABLE

Cohen. Stevens. Kloss. and
Bertocchi decided to appeal the
decision ofthe Election Committee.
They appealed to the Student
Government Judicial Board on the
grounds that :

-the candidates had not been
informed as to the speciﬁc location
of the ballot box in the Towers
Lobby. ‘

-that the Election Committee was
in violation of Article 6.‘Section 10
of the election code. which states
that “The SGEC must act on any
violation of the Sudent Government
Election Code,” _

--that Weiss and"Sc"hwartz

-were brieﬁng Rutter during the

hearing-as witnesses. they ‘were to
remain aloof from the hearing
procedure. and

-that the hearing itself was
biased.

Schwartz said, when questioned
about Cohen’s accusation that he
and Weiss coached Rutter during
the hearing, that “all I did was
point out parts of the election code.
since I am more familiar with it.”
Schwartz had no comment on the
appeal of the Election Committ€e’s
decision.

Weiss said, ‘‘I didn’t say
anything. Scott asked Larry minor

Southeast Asia

By BRIAN BALK

Regionalsim in Southeast Asia
and foreign policy trends were the
topics discussed by a noted expert
on the subject this Wednesday in an
Asian Studies program,-sponsored
lecture.

Among the specific items discuss-
ed were the change in the role of
Vietnam, the new regime in Cam-
bodia, and the stability of the entire
region of Southeast Asia.

In her lecture, Dr.
Graves, chief, Southeast Asian
Branch, Office of Political
Analysis, CIA, emphasized that
Southeast Asia was, and still is, in a
very unstable era. Governmental
shifts, invasions, and wars all

prevail in this area. According to.

Picardi mad the following sug-
gestions. which correspond to each
point of the appeal:

-the provision of the election
code that was violated should be
cited with the allegation;

-that sufficient supporting
documentation of the violation
should be supplied-the appeal must
notify the defending party of the
speciﬁc incidence of violation:

-that where and how Weiss and

Graves, it is important to realize the
significance this unstability has on
the rest of the world.

“The major threat to stability in

the future years -will most likely A

evolve from the individual states in
Southeast Asia,” Graves emphasiz-
ed. The economical and political
tensions in the individual states
alone will cause major. conflicts,
rather than the entire region as a
whole, she said.

According to Graves, these
numerous conflicts have arisen due
to the complexity of our world.
Growing inﬂation, high exporting
rates, and limited energy are just a
few of the existing problems.

The cast knew their:
-characters; the production
was in key. The acting,__ pp
fresh, the set, innovative; all

the elements were there. But
sometimes the sum of the

parts doesn't quite equal the
whole. '
Waiting For Godot is a
highly abstract, highly con-
ceptualized, and highly
oblique portrayal of personal
uncertainty and stagnation.
It is'a plotless story, a taleless
tale; and directorial inter-
pretation is its only-messiah.
But where was it? /

Sacrificed for complete ob-
jectivity, perhaps.

As dramatic literature, ob-
jectivity promotes personal
insight and thematic
variation. On stage, objec-
tivity promotes unending
tedium. Studio Theatre’-s
Godot is simply too cut and
dry for the "theater of the
tasteful."

Aside from this great, ob- ,
, trusive thematic canyon, the

specific action, especially in
the first act, is just too slow.

The Specials
Chysalis

Last year, The Specials led

the march of Britain's ska

revival—the resurrection of
the pre-reggae genre found in

1960's Iamaica that was

derived from American R&B

and soul. However, their
second vinyl venture finds
The Specials radically

. rethinking their ska roots

and shifting paddles in mid-
stream. More Specials is
probably one of the year's -
most courageous albums

.- simply because it dares not
to rehash the beer-crazed ska _

success of their fantastic first
record. The new title says it.
all—The Specials have taken

a sharp right turn down the
MOR.

More Specials begins with
standard Dr. Zhivago movie
scores and generic shopping-
mall muzak and then slaps
an infectious rock-steady
beat behind it all. The
results, for as big as the
gamble, are surprisingly
spectacular. Never, canl
recall a more rock'n’roll use
of a Hammond home organ
sound. Side two is the better
here because of the hilarious
"Stereotype" ("he drinks his

_age in pints") and the char-

ming '’I Just Can't Stand It."
More Specials is more fun.

Waiting for the next — \
Beatles? The wait may not

be as long as you think. Bad- «

finger and The Knack soun-
ded like them, Cheap Trick
wanted to be them, The
Rutles were a parody of_
them, and Klaatu even went
as far as claiming to be THE
Beatles themselves.

The play specializes in wit-
tiness, non sequiters, and a
sprightly disunity. When
done at a conventional or
slightly quickened pace,
these elements mesh together
in an amusing net of con-

fusion, perhaps one of

Beckett's intentions for the
produced work. But brought
nearly to a halt at numerous
times throught the produc-
tion, the dialogue failed in its
subtle, but potentially
hilarious ludicrousness.

However the production
did have its moments.
Relying heavilyion physical
comedy, the stagingfound
some noticable traces of life
in its abundant use of slap-
stick. What would have
seemed overdone in other

Both the womens’ and mens’
gymnastics teams are looking
forward to their finest seasonsever

under’ the instruction of Donna.
‘ DeMarino-Sanft

and Frank
D’Amico. The two teams recently
took top honors in the Keystone
State» Two-Plus-Two Invitational

Meet held on Nov. 1. The
tournament pitted two females and

4 two males from each of five squads

 

that competed in. an all-around
competition in which Pitt scored a
total of 160.9 points to edge out
second place ﬁnisher West Virginia
University with 150.15 points.
Coming in third place was Kent
State with 144.45 points.

The Panthers’ mens’ team also
took the top two positions in the
mens’ division of the competition

eseasonrx

as junior Bobby Besong finished
above all others with an individual
score of 49.7. He was followed by
teammate Chris Semiani with 45.9
points. In the womens’ division.
the Pantherettes once again took
ﬁrst place honors with Lisa Shirk
accumulating 34.35 points. I-Iolly
Martino finished in fourth place
with-*30.95.

“It was a good meet for both
squads,” said DeMarino-Sanft.

“We were able to get one under.

our belts. We had both competed in
intrasquad meets and "everyone
was able to get into routine shape.
Frank and I were both very
encouraged by these four perfor-
mances. November 1 is very early
in the season to compete in such a
meet and yet none became overly
nervous; they all did a fine job
mentally.”

- : -/v ﬁg.-.

D’Amico agreed that all four had
put in a ﬁne performance, despite
his opinion that the tournament’s
scoring left a lot to be desired.

“Our performance outclassed all
the other teams that were
competing with us," said D’Amico.
“Our gymnasts exempliﬁed them-
selves in every way - technique,
execution, and performance. There
was no way that we couldn’t have
placed as highly as we did.

“One __thing that I was disap-
pointed in, though, was the scoring

throughout the tournament.” said .

D’Amico. ‘‘I thought that it was
‘very poor, but’ when we saw what
they were giving the others. they
were terribly low too.”

“I thought that the scores were
inconsistent, but a lot of that in the
womens’ division was due to the’
fact ‘that the International Feder-

sports  

ation has rewritten the entire rule
book for women,” said DeMarino-
Sanft. “I don't think that the
judges were 100 percent comfort-
able with these new rules, and thus
the inconsistency. Now they have
to reevaluate each movement and
it’s harder for the competitor to be
perfect.”

“We have a well-balanced team
that has a lot of potential to finish
very strong in the nationals this
season,” said DeMarino-Sanft. "‘I
think that the team is stronger this
year than when we finished ninth in
the nation two years ago. But
nationals are in April and that’s a
long time away. So our strategy is

for the girls to do a lot more

difficult routines early in the
season so that they can get out any
inconsistencies during December
and January, and have the

peoted f... Gymnastics Teams

expectations of these paying off in
February and March.

D’Amico also agrees that his
team will be one of the finest that
he has coached since comingto
Pitt.

“This squad is the best that I
have V coached at Pitt.” said
D’Amico. “Our scores will deﬁ-
nitely be better than they were last
season. Our overall level of
competition is much improved and
if everyone stays healthy, I look for
a successful year.”

Both squads open regular season
competition in early December,
with the women hosting Alabama
and Maryland on Dec. 6 at Trees
Hall. The 'men will travel to
Farmingdale, New York for an

invitational that will display the

best competitors that the Panthers

- shall face this season.

“He shined,” Newell said.‘

“This weekend he turned in an

One problem for the Pitt tea
was penalties in the last period.
“That’s how Buffalo got their

“We had them shut out for the first

This weekend, Pitt will playiat

Newell is expecting a hard. hitting

as equal to the University of Ohio.

Newell. "Oaur sights are set on Penn

bowls? It seems not, as both Pitt and Penn State were
shut out of this year’s New Year's Day contests. Instead
of choosing the winner of the Pitt-Penn State shoot-
out, the major bowl committees went for the big names
of Notre Dame and Alabama to respectively fill the
Sugar and Cotton Bowls.

‘Notre Dame and Alabama played a game on national
television last week that could not have impressed many
people if they had "actually looked at how the teams
were playing’. The Irish won 7-0, but neither team
could_mount much of an offense and the only touch-
down was scored when Alabama fumbled on its own
two-yard line.

By virtue of that loss, the Tide slipped to eighth in the

   
   
  
   
   
  
   
   
   
  

earned a bid to the Cotton Bowl to play Southwest
Conference champion Baylor. Figure that one ‘out,
sports fans. So now the Cotton Bowl has a match-up
of number eight ranked Alabama with an 8-2 record
and llth-rated Baylor with a 9-1 record. Alabama
could end up 8-3, and no better than 9-2. Doesn’t
sound much like a major bowl to this reporter.

As for the Sugar Bowl, Georgia must play Georgia
Tech as its final regular season game. Despite a 1-8-1
record, that one tie by Tech was with Notre Dame. lt’s
not all that impossible that the Yellowjackets could lose
theirseason finale. Georgia's Sugar Bowl opponent,
Notre Dame, was not only unimpressive against
Alabama, but the Irish were tied by Tech. Notre
Dame’s season-ender is with Southern California at Los
Angeles. It wasn’t all that long ago that the Irish were
leading USC 24-0 late in the first-half of a game at the
same site and ended up losing 55-24.. Stranger things’

Out Of Bounds

By Jeff Durosko

 

The Orange’ Bowl, which earlier in the season went
on record as saying they didn't want a re-match game,
may have just that. If Nebraska does beat Oklahoma,
the Huskers will be out to get revenge on the Seminoles’
for their only defeat thus far this season. However, if
Oklahoma beat,Nebraska, it will be a match-up of the

ninth-ranked Sooners and the «third-ranked Seminoles

in the Orange Bowl. A A -

Does it sometimes seem that Pitt students (football
fans) are going to the wrong school? V

Why do the names of Notre Dame and Alabama
carry so much weight? Is it because, as the bumper
stickers say, “God made Notre Dame number one,”
and because Paul “Bear” Bryant is God, ‘according to
Alabama enthusiasts? -—

Though these solutions seems to be good reasons, it

is doubtful they are correct. The Cotton Bowl bid for‘

Alabama is-just another example of Bryant's power in
the world of collegefootball. He controls his own and
Alabama’s destiny purely because of‘his name. He’s
Bear Bryant.

As for the Irish, they are simply Notre Dame and by
virtue of that, a big football school with a good football

team. Despite the tie to Georgia Tech, the Irish remain v

ranked above Pitt and Penn State only because they are

Notre Dame. The Panthers’ only loss’ was to third- 

ranked Florida‘State and Penn State's lone setback was
to number four Nebraska. Georgia»Tech ranks only in
the nation’s bottom 20». , » _ '_ , ‘ ‘

because the two teams are in “minor” bowls, it won’t

- I-lere’s_ho’w it could happen:

Now, if all these “ifs” become reality, logically, Pitt
or Penn State would be ranked number one, providing

that team__won its'bowl, ‘because all the teams
ranked ahead of them would have lost.

But, who ever said logic ever came into the minds of ,

the voters in the polls? If all those ifs did come about,
the people who vote in the polls would most likely jump
Oklahoma, or even Baylor over the Panthers or _Lions
simply because that team'hadn’t playedin a “major”

bowl. Therefore, the mistake that the bowl committees ’

made, looking for money, and audiences, could have
been one of the most unfair things to happen to the Pitt
