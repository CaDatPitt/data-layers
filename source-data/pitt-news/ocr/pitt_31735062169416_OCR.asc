Academic Freedom Cited

As Main Issue in Frick Rift

  

DAVE) KURTZNIAN
Comments on Frick Feud

by DAN BOOKEB
(See Editorial-—“No Margin
‘of E'r'rorr”—Page Four)
Confusion ‘over the reasons
for the recent Frick-Pitt rift
has increased steadily since
the break was first revealed,
The preservation of academ-
ic freedom was the‘ initial
-reason given by University
officials. Then Dr. Charles

Peak, “ vice-chancellor for "the i

‘ academic disciplines, insisted
that the main reasontfor the
conflict revolved around who

would have ultimate control of
the Frick Fine Arts Building. This

was also the angle pursued by
David B. Buerger, Miss Helen
Clay Frick’s attorney, when he
was interviewed by city papers.
It wasn’t until yesterday that the
Pitt News could reach the man
at the University who should
have the ﬁnal answer—Chancel-
lor David H. Kurtzman.

Dr. Kurtzman, just returned
from receivingian honorary de-
gree at Temple University, stated
the basic issue ﬂatly as “Wheth-
er anyone outside the University
should have control over facul-
ty.” Miss Frick, said Dr. Kurtz-
man, demanded that both Dr.
William Lo-erke, head of the ﬁne
arts department, and Dr. Frank
W. Wadsworth, dean of the hu-
manities, be ﬁred. “If we gave in
to these demands,” stated Kurtz-
man, “we might just as well sell
professorships.”

If it hadn’t been for these fac-
ulty demands, noted Kurtzman,’.
we could have “lived with” other
annoyances concerning the build-
ing. But, he said, a university
must be a free agent in the re-
cruitment of faculty. He men-
tioned that the Mellons do not
choose the people who will ﬁll
the Mellon professorships, even
though they provide the money.

The question of a u.niversity’s
freedom to act as it seesiﬁt great-
ly overshadows ‘questions of who
should have control over the
building as far as Kurtzman is
concerned. In the light of this
question of academic freedom,
these other arguments are like

:Let Freedom Ring”

Messages Dispel Communism

by IVAN ABRAMS

“Lucky Strike cigarets are
manufactured by Commun-
ist traitors.” . . . “The Na-
tional Council of Churches is
a Communist Organization.”
J . . “The United Nations is

signed to destroy the United
States.” . . “LS-D will be

put into the world’s water sup-
plies to enable the Communists to
destroy peoples’ minds and take
over the world.”

These are some of the claims
made by “Let Freedom Ring,” a
nationally syndicated telephone
message sponsored in the Pitts-
burgh area by John Mihalic.

A member of the John Birch

I Society for two years, Mihalic
has? not alwa s been'*involved' in‘

ultra-conservative politics. In fact,
during his years as a student at
California State University( Pa.)
and as an art teacher in Verona.
he says he “had socialistic be-
liefs brought on by contact with
the academic community.”

However, in order to earn a
living to support his wife and
two young children, Milhalic was
forced to leave teaching and go
into business. Now, at the age of
30 he is district manager of Lus-
trecraft, a stainless steel cook-
war-e ﬁrm.

Mihalic’s conversion to the far
right occured, he feels, when he
entered business. “As I earned
money on my own I saw the in-
ﬁltration of government into ev-
ery aspect of life. Most people
don’t know what freedom is until
they've lost it,” he -said. Accord-
ing to Mihalic, then, the goals of
the John Birch Society are less
government and more individual
responsibility, thereby creating
a better world.

Mihalic would not comment on
“Let Freedom Ring,” which can
be reached by dialing 333-9300,
except to say, “the scripts come
from Sarasota, Fla., and I gen-
erally agree with them. However,
I don’t know enough about the
speciﬁc messages to speak about
them.” To sponsor “Let Freedom
Ring,” he pays'$24 yearly to Dr.
W. C. Douglas of Sarasota.

cent change in status of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh to a. state-
related school and commented
that the while he was not really
acquainted with the issues in-
volved, he felt that the lowest
form of government possible, in
this case the city, should control
such institutions. In that case,
however, tuition might not be
maintained at its present low
rate, he said.

Mihalic also discussed contem-
porary college students and their
involvement with society. On
Vietnam, he said that few stu-
dents know the ‘‘real truth”
about the conﬂict and that those
who picket and protest the war
and attempt to avoid induction
are being led by trained Com-.
munist agitators who seize upon
the students’ ignorance. But Mi-
halic himself stated that “I can’t
see how this war is going to help
our country. If we’re not going
to win we should pull out imme-
diately’.’ And, in his opinion, the
United States is not winning.

Another common student com-
mitment is in the ﬁeld of civil
rights. Here again Mihalic be-
lieves that “Communist agita-
tors” cause riots by convincing
‘Negroes that they are oppressed.
In Mihalic’s opinion, the Ameri-
can Negro today has 95 per cent
of the rights and privileges of
the American white and is well

‘off. compared to the situation in

“neighbors yelling at each other

Kurtzman.

Dr. Kurtzrnan stated that un- I

tenance of the building and sal-

to name the director and assis-
tant director of the building, as

 Chancellor Kurtzman Supports Dr. Peake;
Says Frick Attorny Brger Wrong

(Continued from Page 1)
owned by the University is ac-
tually held in trust for the peo-
ple of the community and thus,
as the Nationality Rooms, are
available to the city. The build-
ing was not built as a museum,
said Kurtzman, but that it would
be open for people to view any
art treasures that might be there.

The chancellor emphasized that
“we are as proud of the building
as anyone and will care for it as
well as we of any other build-
ing.” To prevent any sort of van-
dalism or defacement of the
bulding, Miss Frick had paid sal-
aries for around-the-clock secur-
ity guards. Probably, the Univer-
sity will not pay for such protec-
tion. And Miss Frick has noted
that she wﬂl “keep an eye” on
the building as a private taxpay-
er to make sure that the phrase
“academic freedom” is not used
to excuse vandalism.

In another aspect of the con-
troversy, the Pittsburgh Post-Ga-

zette quoted Buerger as saying,
“Chancellor Kurtzman was dis-
satisﬁed with the way Peake was
handling things (negotiations with
Miss Frick) and the chancellor
and I met privately so as to avoid
Peake.”

Dr. Kurtzman admitted that he
did meet privately with Buerger
to “seek out any possible way
we could possibly reconcile dif-
ferences.” These meetings were
held with Peake’s knowledge and
the chancellor stated bluntly that
“It was not correct,” that he was
dissatisﬁed with the action Peake
was taking. “I just felt that I
could do more personally,” con-
tinued Kurtzman.

Kurtzman remarked that he
had spoken several times to Miss
Frick personally, but that most of
the negotiations were handled
through Buerger. Since the nego-
tiations apparently weren’t going
to be personal, added Kurtzman,
he called in Charles Arensberg,
the University's attorney. Kurtz-

man likened this case to the Wil-
liam Manchester-Kennedy strug-
gle in which arbitration was han-
dled through lawyers and be-
tween the actual parties involved.
“This may be why no agreement
was reached (in the Frick dis-
pute),” commented Kurtzman.
Dr. Kurtzman noted that the
University would accept future
gifts from Miss Frick if they
were offered only if no restric-
tions Were placed upon their use.

Undoubtedly, much of the art
work adorning the ﬁne arts build-
ing will be removed. This in-
cludes the “oldest painting in
Pittsburgh,” a Chinese work dat-
ing from the seventh century,
and an unglazed bowl, dating
from 4000 BC, according to Prof.
Walter Reed Hovey, whose dis-
missal as director of the Frick
Building will be effective in
April. .

“Combined with Miss Frick’s
collection, we would have had
one of the most complete collec-
tions of Chinese ceramics found
anywhere,” c 0 mm c n t e d Hovey.
These things "probably will now
go to the Westmoreland County
Museum in Greensburg.

Among the objects that will

stay is the pipe organ donted by‘

Miss Frick that used to be play-
ed by her mother. Robert Suth-
erland Lord, University organist,
does not know, however, if his
recitals will continue.

“Farm Near Harrisburg,” by
Andrew Wyeth, will also remain
in the building.

guards were still present.

  Error

' P Secondly, a continuation of the present Frick—University relation

No one w'1l

local philan-

time, such an argument is hard-
1:; disputable. -

However, I submit there ar
other equally compelling reasons
to account for the shortcomings
of Pitt Student Government. Per-
haps one example will servc to
illustrate my point.

In Friday's Pitt News it was
noted that Ideas and Figures re-
quest for $320 was denied by the
Senate, but $500lwas alloted to
the ROTC Cadet Brigade to pay
for ceremonial sabres. Granted
the importance of having the
ROTC men look sharp, how can
one justify not lending the prop-
er ﬁnancial support to this
school’s- literary magazine? Can
it be that our venerable leaders
do not think it deserving enough?

Surely a University's academic
excellence is in part reflected by
the caliber of its publications.
That Pitt's publications leave
something to be desired is evi-
dent; but that there are people
who have power to help them
and do not is inexcusable.

A majority of Pitt students
look upon Student Government as
a joke. Why? Because they sim-
ply do not give a darn? Perhaps.
But might it not also be because
Student Government never seems

to do very much for them——given ‘

the amount of control they do
exercise? As a commuter who-
appreciates a good school liter-
ary magazine, I obviously speak
with a distinct bias. But I won-
der how many other students feel
a similar dissatisfaction (irrita-
tion?) with “their" government.

As the saying goes, the pen is
mightier than the sword. But it

_ seems clear‘ that at Pitt just the

opposite is true. And‘ it also
seems abundantly clear that a
Pitt Student Government will re-
main the atrophied organ it is

‘until those who would lead it

recognize and pursue the basic
purpose for which any student
government exists: namely, the
betterment of the students’ lot.

Student Attacks
CheatingProblem

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have been following the re-

to the cheating problem. I have
come to the conclusion that most

test, why do the readings or
even attend lectures?

Today -I took a Psych. 80 test.
I. had done all the readings and
attended all the lectures. Behind
me sat a girl. Before the period
started she dropped a “piece of
paper” under my friends seat.
The piece of paper was a crib
sheet. What chance did she have
of being caught with only three’
proctors to supervise the whole
lecture hall (L223),.which was
crowded to capacity? Obviously
she didn't have to worry about
the draft. By cheating she could
effectively cut down her time
studying for the test. She could
also skip some of the readings
and cut lectures, thus leaving
more time to enjoy social activ-
ities.

Cheating not. only hurts the in-
dividual's education, but is also
unfair to serious students. This

would ‘have been deeply disturbing to many members of the faculty. Natur-
ally the faculty would be most upset when they hear that a donor is ask-
ing for the removal of the Dean of the Humanities and Chairman of the
Fine. Arts Department. The effect such a situation could have on the morale
of the professors could have been inevitably more disasterous than the
loss of a collection of Chinese ceramics.

As Chancellor Kurtzman pointed out, Miss Frick’s demands concern— -
ing the faculty were indeed the major problems. It was her attempt to
dictate policy in this area that made the situation impossible to accept.
Nothing that has been said in recent days by either Mr. Buerger or Pro-
fessor Hovey that would make one think that the administration was in
error. We would hope‘ the faculty students and members of the community
join us in publicly declaring their support -of the University's stand in this
crucial issue of academic integrity. '

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

is why I hardly endorse Chancel-
lor Kurtzman’s suggestions for
the elimination of cheating as re-
ported in the Pitt News.

Brave Gir1NamedLinda

(The article below is reprinterl
from Pittsburgh Weekly Sports.
O’B~rien, the author, is publis-lzer
of that paper and is a former
sports editor of the Pit_t News.)

by JIIVI O’BRIEN

The crowds at Pitt basket-

ball» games this year have
been poorer than ever. Try-
ing to explain it, coach Bob
Timmons offered among oth-
other reasons that “no one
wants to come up that hill.” Of-
ten referred -to as “Cardiac Hill”
and “Heart Attack Hill,” it has
proved no obstacle for a brave
little girl named Linda.

Saturday has always been a_

special day for Linda DeCampli.
She remembers how it was es-
pecially nice when she was ﬁve-
years-old and‘ her family and
friends would all come to see her
that day when she was in Pitts-
burgh Municipal Hospital.

That was in 1952. Today the
building on the same site is call-
ed Salk Hall in honor of Dr. Jon-
as Salk, the man who discovered
polio vaccine at Pitt in 1953. It
was a year too late for Linda.

She remembers how it all start-
ed when she was in kindergarten
one day——only 12 days after she
had started school. She recalled
the incident, rather matter-of-
factly, sitting on a couch in the
lobby of Tower C at Pitt where
she’s a sophomore now.

“My legs felt like they were
going to sleep——you know, like
pins and needles,” she said. “It
worked up slowly. By the end of
the day they just weren’t operat-
ing.”

Her parents took her to Muni-
cipal Hospital, and there she stay-
ed for three months—-from Sep-
tember through November, which
just happens to be football sea-
son at Pitt.

Linda ' remembers how the.

nurse would draw the drapes and

open the window and how she
could look across the street, di-
rectly into Gate 3 of Pitt Stadi-
um. She’d watch the people go-
ing in to see the game and she'd
hear the crowd noises and the
excitement of the game.

That’s when she ﬁrst became a
football fan.

Today the football players at

Pitt call her the den mother of V

the school football team. She's
always peppering the big guys
with questions about their play,
and she can cite more statistics

‘about their performances than

they can. “Some kids around
here,” she says, “don’t even know
what’s going on.”

Linda did, because she went
to every varsity game at home,
and traveled by car with her par.
ents and boy friend to watch
Pitt Dlay Notre Dame at South
Bend. She even went to see all
the freshman games at Pitt Sta.
dium.

She did it the hard way. Sl1un-
ning the shuttle buses, she walk-
ed up the hill. And if you ever
recall yourself beefing about that
walk up DeSoto and Stadium Sts.,
imagine what it’s like when your

legs are in braces, and you have

to push off crutches and swing

both legs out with each step. Try
putting a ﬁve-pound lead weight
around each ankle, ‘and you’ll
get an idea of what it’s like.
Linda sees nothing special about
up the hill: “That’s the only way

to go,” she says. “You’ve got to
go up the hill. My folks ‘were
here for Parents’ Weekend and
my mother thought we should
take a bus up to the stadium, but
I got them to walk up.

“Sure, it’s a little harder to
walk up. I just start out a little
earlier, that's all. I'm a little
slower than other people. You
get tired, sure, but you know
what’s up there. It's worth going
up to.” 0

Others may dispute this ﬁnal
claim, because Pitt was 1-9 in
football. “Football is the sport,”
she said emphatically. It. doesn't
matter whether you win or lose.
There should be lots of people
up there —— students supporting
other students, if nothing else.
My friends have to go up. I use
more energy yelling and cheer-
ing than I do going up the hill.”

She admitted that soreness de-
veloped the ﬁrst few times she
went up the hill, and that the
ﬁrst time she entered the student
section, she fell going up the
stairway, but she’s not easily dis-
couraged. »

Linda came up to the Field
House for three basketball games
in December. There was some
snow still on the ground outside
the_ Field House the night the
Pitt varsity played their fresh-
man team in a pre-season work-
out, and it was a cold and damp
night. '

Someone offered her a ride
down to the dormitories after-
Wa1‘d- .“Thank you,” she said’,
smiling. “But I’m going to walk
down. I’m used to it.” A

1867. Students and Negroes who
disagree with this philosophy

are, according to Mihalic, the.

dupes of the Communists who in-
still a belief in class differences
in their followers and thus cause
racial strife.

Mihalic was also alarmed by
the use of drugs such as LSD and
marijuana on college campuses.
This phenomenon he also attri-
butes to Communist causes, say-
ing “while I don’t think that
every ‘pusher’ is a Communist
agent I do think that there’s a
good chance the Communists are
in this trying to corrupt the mor-

~ alsof the country.”

John Mihalic feels that college
students are affected by a sort of
moral decay. They are at a stage
in their lives when they are
searching for knowledge which,
Mihalic states, they are unable
to ﬁnd in. today’s university.
“This is because too much is left
up to the students. They’re.not in
a school to make up their own
minds, especially if they have no
truth to base it on,” he said.

“In this respect your new
chancellor is very naive if he
thinks he can have a Communist
speaker on campus and hear the
truth. Instead he should have
someone from the FBI talk who
knows the real truth about the
Reds,” he added, refering to Dr.
Wesley Posvar’s opinion that
free speech is a vital asset to any
campus.

Mihalic agrees with a state-
ment by I{obert,Welch, founder
of the John Birch Society, which
says that “very few Communists
teach in grade schools, more in
high schools, still more in col-
leges, an even larger percentage
in graduate school, and the high-
881- percentage are college presi-

   

— .—.Monday,

dents.” Mihalic sees this alleged
Communism in the university
hierarchies as ﬁltering down
through the ranks so that any
professor who has achieved ten-
ure can be thought to echo the
views of his administrators. Mr.
Mihalic could not, however, com-
ment on the situation at the Uni-
versity.

College students, in Mihalic’s
opinion, are not inherently evil
or corrupt, merely misguided.
“They have been left on their
own for too long and now need
more rigid instruction in the val-
ues of Americanism. But the col-
leges won’t provide this instruc-
tion so the younger generation is
going over to the other side
which does give them concrete
training,” said Mihalic.

Even contemporary dances are,

Cagers Top Titans;
Bollens Scores 30

by JAY ROSENSTEIN, Assistant Sports Editor
Rumor has it that Ken Bollens is giving Horse Czer-
necki a Valentine’s present. After all, Horse put up the bas-

_ kets in the Field House, and Bollens took advantage of the

friendly hoops by scoring 30 points and leading the Panthers

_ to an 83-72 win over Westminster Saturday afternoon;

Bollens averages only 10 points a game, yet this was
the third time that he had scored atleast 25. And both of
the other two occasions were at home.

The Panther forward teamed with Stan Falenski to cut down the
Titans. With the score 47-47 midway through the sec.nd half, Falenski
hit a jump shot from the corner to break the tie, and the rout was on.

Bollens scored on a._ layup after a pass from Falenski and 20
seconds later Falenski had an easy layup after a pass from Bollens.
The Panthers combined layups and tap-ins with a one-and-one foul

situation to run away to a 69-51 advantage.

“We could get inside and score on this team,’ said coach Bob
Timmons after the game. “Against bigger teams we can’t.”

“We almost broke the game open,” he added, but Westminster
came back. Our defense concentrated on their outside men, rather
than worry about anyone inside. Their strength lies with their shoot-

ers.”

Timmons credits Pete Smith with a greatjob on John Fontanella,
the Titans’ top scorer. Smith limited ‘him to 13 points without draw-

Gymnastics Receives
Go Ahead Signal

In recent years gymnastics has been the orphan of the

severely neglected and that neglect has been more than ob-

orphan_ s

Obviously embarrassed by this year’s 1-7 record, the
Athletic Department has gathered the floundering gym-

nasts under its wing and coach Warren Nei-
ger has been given the go ahead to start
pumping adrenalin into the system.
Around the East, the appeal of gymnas-
tics has been taking an upward spiral. Penn
 State draws 7,000 fans for a home meet.
 Springfield has been hosting several thou-
sand weekly. Where" popularity lies, tele-
vision follows and even Pitt is getting in on
— the act. At their next meet with Temple, a
S ’ local TV unit will broadcast the match over
the Philadelphia area.

The appeal of gymnastics is mainly an aesthetic one. It
involves form, skill and aeronautic risk. Provided -proper
promotion and Iatmosphere, it is easy to draw a captive audi-
ence and such a situation exists in University Park.

It was Neiger that coined the phrase “captive audience,”
but he realizes that Pitt could never draw like State. While
Pitt might never draw like State, with the proper handling
there’s no reason why the gymnasts can’t approach the Nit-
tany Lions’ level of competition.

“Steps have been taken to remedy the situation,” says
Neiger, “The results aren't going to show for several years,
but I’m optimistic about the future. In time I think we can
match every team on our schedule.”

Neiger’s main problem has been lack of -depth and its
roots rest with the freshman team. While State or Temple
have enough freshmen gymnasts to .field a team, Pitt hasn’t
been so blessed recently. -

“We had a freshman team in the past,” reflected Nei-
ger, “'but then we had to cut back. It shows in the varsity.
All season we’ve fielded seven performers versus our op-
ponents 14 or 15.”

The green light has been given for next year accord-

ing to Neiger and he’s accelerating his recruiting tentacles.
“With a bigger squad we can aff-ord eliminations and rank-
ings. Something we can’t do now.”

Neiger is confident that he can draw all the boys he
needs from the Western Pennsylvania area. The level of
competition has been rising steadily in the WPIAL,

“We’ve received good interest from Penn Hills, Butler,
West Mifflin, and others, It's getting better and better.
Two boys have already been admitted from Penn Hills and
we have a chance for two more.” '

Also bo_osting Neiger’s efforts has been the state-relat-
ed status and drop in tuition. Now, more gymnasts might
come here on their own without aid and still come out for
the team. ‘

Currently gymnastics is one of the low men on the ath-

letic totem pole but, at least, its orphaned days are_in the
past.’ There's only one way to go and that's up.

Cubs Second Half Rally

N i 193 Westminster J.V.’s

. by MIKE BROURMAN
Westminster had the last laugh, but the joke was on
them as the freshman cagers nipped the Little Titans, 54-53,

Saturday at the Field House. A

The comical situation came about with two seconds left
in the game, and the Cubs leading 54-51. As Bill Samuels

got set to throw the ball in for
Westminster, he was astonished
to see none of the Cubs playing
defense. With a three point
lead, coach Tim Grgurich didn’t
want to risk a foul, and a possi-
ble tying play.

While the frosh stood in their
secluded corner of the ﬂoor Sam-
uels started laughing. Then he
threw the ball in to Ted Shu-
macher, who put in the meaning-
less basket. “It was funny al-
right, but I felt sort of helpless
too,” said the still startled Sam-
uels afterwards.

It took the Cubs quite a while
to maneuver themselves into posi-
tion for that ﬁnal play. Once
again they were behind in the
early going, trailing by as much
as 11 points in the ﬁrst half. A
late rally narrowed it 11029-24 at
the half.

A pressing defense gave the
Cubs the chance to catchand
pass the Little Titans in the sec-
ond period. Westminster lo-st the
ball eight of the ﬁrst 10 times
they had it without a shot, dur-
ing which time the frosh pulled
to a 36-33 advantage.

Pi Lam Tops
League “A”

In a come from behind victory,
Pi Lambda Phi defeated Delta
Tau Delta, 39-35, and gained un-
disputed ﬁrst place in league
“A,” Thursday.

The scores of other action were:
Phi Epsilon Pi rolling over Delta
Sigma Phi, 55-36, and Sigma Chi
crushing Sigma Alpha Mu, 59-44.

Down by one point at the half
and ﬁve points at the third per-
iod mark, Pi Lam came back
strong in the fourth quarter to
gain their victory. Craig Saunder
with '16 points led the well-bal-
anced Pi Lam attack.

Sigma Chi, with a very strong
ﬁrst half, cruised to an easy vic-
tory over the Sammies. Sharing
the game’s scoring honors were
Ralph Manning and Doug Mos-
hier with 16 and 15 points, re-
speetively. 6

 

Paul Naponick, and two jump
shots by Bob Brickner increased
the advantage to 44-36 with 10:20
left. McFarland scored two more
baskets after Westminster had
narrowed the gap to 45-43, and
then he hit Mike Patcher for an
easy layup.

That made the score 52-45 with
just over a minute left, but as
it turned out, it took two clutch
free throws by Dick Hassinger to
insure the victory. Hassinger,
playing on a badly injureduankle,
was forced into action when Bob
Petrini was injured. “He deserves
all the credit for our win,” said
McFarland, who had his best
scoring day of the season with
20 points.

ing a foul.

Westminster made a futile at-
tempt at a comeback. With two
minutes left, the Titans had
closed the gap to 75-76 on the
jumpshooting of Russel Boston.
But Smith kept the Panthers out
of trouble by converting eight of
eight free throws during the"clos-
ing moments. _

The cagers made 31 of 38 from
the foul line as compared to
Westminster’s 12 of 22. Both
teams shot 50 per cent from the
field.

But board strength made the
real difference. Jim LaValley and
Bollens dominated both back-
boards, rarely giving‘ Westmins-
ter a second shot on offense, and
usually providing their team-
mates another opportunity to
score.

LaValley pulled down 15 re-
bounds and scored 19 points.
Smith contributed 12 points and
Falenski added 11.

Bollens, who made 11 of 16
shots and eight of eight free
throws had better make the Val-
lentine gift an expensive ones.

Gymnasts Lose Seventh

by ANDY SWARTZ

As Dave Shidemantel
sprinted down the 25-yard
approach, leaped off the
springboard, did a flawless
cartwheel on the longhorse,
landing perfectly, the loudest ap-

plause of the day echoed through
half-ﬁlled Trees Hall. ——

Unfortunately for the gymnasts,
there is only one Dave Shideman-
tle, therefore, there was only
one first place against Navy last
Saturday. It was the same old
story for the gymnasts who were
easily defeated by the Midship-
man, l71-l49, going down to their
seventh defeat of the season.

Following the first four events,
Navy opened up a commanding
20 point leading, takings ﬁrsts in
the floor exercises, side horse,
trampoline, and horizontal bar.
Shidemantle and Ig Perez man-
aged to tie for second in the
ﬂoor exercises; Jim Sacco took
a third on the sidehorse and
horizontal bar, and Shidemantle
took a third on the trampoline.

The long horse vault was the
only bright spot of the day for
the gymnasts with Shidemantle

pg taking his usual ﬁrst place and’

Sacco placed second on the
parallel bars and third on the
still rings to ﬁnish the meet but
it wasn’t nearly enough to even
make it a close meet. Sacco had
his best day of the season plac-
ing in four of the seven events
and winning in the Olympic All-
around division.

 Record Primed E

-/L

For John Lane’s 

by GEORGE LIES
John Lane, the swimmer
who once churned a pool like

a whipped cream mixer, now
resembles an Eastern Champion.

lAnd.if it wasn’t for the fact that

somebody might object, he’d prob-
ably convert one of the ﬂoors in
the Towers into a swimming
pool. '

For as soon as school opened,
he started to practice on his own,
sometimes going to Trees Hall
twice a day. “I have personal
goals, ‘and I have’ to get there,”
he said.

As a good swimmer should,
Lane has worked-out year "round
ever since a fellow by the name
of Jack Collins, owner of New
Rochelle, N. Y.’s Badgers Sports
club, changed his stroke.

“Collins knew swimming inside
and out,” Lane said. “Some great

_ swimmers have come to him for

help.

“I used to swim so wrong, I
couldn’t help but build myself
up,” Lane said. “For one thing I
am supposedly a distance swim-
mer, but I don’t have a good
kicking stroke and when I have
a sprint I have to keep myself
up.”

Against Syracuse in the team’s-
second meet, Lane kept himself
“up” enough to establish a new
school record in the 100-yard
freestyle. He clocked 4-9 seconds
ﬂat, bettering the old mark by
one second.

His other marks aren’t bad'ei-
ther. In the 200-yard freestyle,
Lane swam 1:50.6 and just miss-
ed .another record by two-tenths
of a second. In the 200—yard in-
dividual medley, Lane missed
again by one and eight-tenths
seconds, swimming it in 2;o9,s,

The best time for his favorite
event, the 500-yard freestyle, is
5:19.6 which is almost seven and
nine-tenths seconds over Rob Le-
vine’s 1964 record time.

Swimming in so many differ-
ent races could be confusing, but
Lane, like a general, thinks out
strategy just before he readies
himself for the kill. -

The Navy track team had a
short but productive practice on
Saturday. It‘ was more of a prac-
tice than a meet with the track-
sters because no real competition
was involved. In this case, the
ﬁnal score of 95-14 indicates ex-
actly the course of the -meet.

A few of the visitors did well,
although they failed to take a
ﬁrst place throughout the meet.
Greg Ellis was third in the shot
put. The sophomore putter seems
to have leveled off from his me-
teoric climb to a new varsity rec-
ord. But coach Jim Banner ex-
pects Ellis to improve within a
few weeks. _

The hurdles record was ﬁnally
tied at least.’ Dave Brinn and
Paul Lamberteach had a 7.5 sec-
ond‘ time. That ties the Fitzger-
ald Field House mark and is _a
tenth of a second off the varsity
record. But it was only good for
a second place against the Mid-
dies.

    

JOHN LANE
‘ Reaclys for Easterns

on the event,” Lane said. “In
the 100, I think about my starts;
the 200, it’s breathing pattern;
and in the 500, no one really
cares until after the ﬁrst ‘200
yards.” '

Last year, Lane competed in
the Eastern Collegiate Swimming
Championships as. a sophomore,
In the 1,650-yard freestyle he
placed eighth out of a ﬁeld of 37-; _

in the '500, he ﬁnished 14 out of
40, and in the 200, he placed
15th out of 68.

“You should, have very loose
muscles if you're a swimmer,”
Lane said. “But I don’t. Mostly
all of them can touch their hands
behind their backs, but I’m lucky
I can get mine a yard apart.”

Even if Lane can’t touch his
hands, he may be seated at the
