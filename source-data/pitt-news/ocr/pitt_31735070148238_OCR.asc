ACLU retractsstatement

about Pitt lawsuit‘ settlement

Mallory Grossman '

News Editor

The ACLU retracted late Tuesday
a claim it made earlier that day
that Pitt reached a settlement

with Elijah Matheny in a federal,

lawsuit over an incident with Pitt
police in 2009.

After issuing the press release
early Tuesday afternoon, the
American Civil Liberties Union
retracted its statement that Pitt
had agreed to pay a settlement
of $48,500 to Matheny, a Pitts-

by University police and charged
with wiretapping in 2009.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill
said that the “University was not

a party to the lawsuit mentioned ‘

by the ACLU in its news release,”
although the original lawsuit
listed a Pitt police officer as a
defendant in the case.

After the press release was

rescinded, Witold Walczak, the
ACLU of Pennsylvania -legal di-
rector, said that no settlement
has been made and that he has
no further comment regarding
a trial in the works or any future

He also declined to comment
on why the press release was sent
out by the ACLU._ ' .

The Pitt officer was dismissed
as a defendant by a federal judge
last year, but the ACLU appealed
the decision to the 3rd U.S. Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals.

Matheny was arrested on April
29, 2009 by Pittpolice after using
his cell phone to record the of-
ficers detaining and questioning
his friend. Police then arrested
Matheny on chargesof violat-
ing the Wiretap Act, which for-

 

BASEBALL

Two Pitt players  
drafted in  
seventh round

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Two Pitt baseball players were
scooped up by Major League
Baseball yesterday.

The teams selected the Pitt
athletes six picks apart in the sev-
enth round. The Chicago White
Sox chose Smith, asenior catcher,
with the 231st overall pick and
the San Francisco Giants draft-
ed redshirt sophomore Black, a
right—handed pitcher, with the
237th selection.

The seventh—highest draft pick
produced by Pitt, Smith, who
graduated in May, finished his
career as a Panther ﬁfth in career
batting average (.375), eighth in
career stolen bases (313) and 10th
in career RBI (123);

Pitt head coach Joe Jordano
said in a press release that Smith
could be one of the most talented
players available.

“For a senior to be drafted in":
the seventh round, it proves his
value and his skill set,” Jordano
said. “We all very much look for-
ward to watching his professional
career. He was an integral part of
our team, and I am very happy
he decided to play baseball a few
years ago. He has worked very
hard and I believe his best years
are ahead of him.”

Smith spent his freshman year
at Pitt vying for the quarterback
position on Pitt’s football team
before deciding to pursue base-
ball as a sophomore. Last year,
Smith tied for the Big East Con-
ference lead with a .396 batting

son. A

He also_topped the confer-
ence with 56 runs scored during
the regular season while driving
in eight home runs and 52 RBI.
Smith ranked 21st in the coun-
try with a slugging percentage of
.675 and 22nd in batting average"
(.397):

Smith, a graduate of Seneca
Valley High School in Cranberry
Township, was an all—Big East
first-team and a Big East all—tour—
nament team selection in 2010
and 2011. He majored in market-
ing in Pitt’s College of Business
Administration.

Unlike Smith, Black, the
eighth—highest draft pick to come
out of Pitt, still has eligibility
remaining as a Panther and can
return to play) college baseball if
he chooses.

“Today is a very exciting day
for me,” Black said in the release.
“I_am presented with a great op-
portunity..I could come back to
the University of Pittsburgh for
my junior year,‘or I can play at

_ the professional level. It’s a nice

choice to have to make.”

Capable of reaching the upper— C
905 with hisvfastball, Black ap-,

peared 18 times as a relief pitcher
last season. He finished with four

saves and a 1-1 record, striking

out 33 batters in 20 innings.

Black, who hails from Wilkes-
Barre, Pa., set the single season
record for strikeouts per nine in-
nings last season with 14.85. In
two seasons as a Panther, Black
has appeared 30 times and start-
ed twice. ‘ C

officially entered the contest for the

broadcast nationally.

Most national polls have Santorum
in single digits —' in some, less than
ﬁve percent of Republicans said they
would vote forhim. All the major polls
taken in the ﬁrst three primary states
of Iowa, New Hampshire and South
Carolina have the former senator in
single digits.

Santorum used the majority of
Monday’s speech to criticize the cur-

“They want to hook you, not ﬁee

Santorum said that over the past

has consistently given, he said at the
announcement, was,“No, I’rn_ not run-

Carpentersgprotest at Schenley  

Plaza construction site

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Men holding picketing signs
surrounded the green fence ‘in
Schenley Plaza on Monday and

Tuesday afternoon to protest,

what they called unfair wages
for the carpenters working on
the site. V V
The Greater Pennsylvania
Regional Council of Carpenters
organized the protest at the
Eat’n Park Hospitality Group’s
construction site. The protesters
— who varied in number from
10 to 20 over the course of the
two—day protest ‘— all held signs

. that read “We want the public to

know Bridges is undermining

wages and conditions.”-A
Mark Davis, the vice president
of Bridges General Contractors,

. the contractor working on the

site, said that the protesters have
free-speech rights andlmembers

of his company will exercise theirs

if they feel it is necessary.

His’ response to the protest
was, “There go the unions belly-
aching again.”

Mike Sepesy, an organizer
behind the protest, said that the
group’s complaint is that Eat’n
Park and Bridges General Con-
tractors are undercutting wages
and area standards, that have been
put in place for many years.

The area standards Sepesy re-
ferred to are ones that the con-

Supporters of LGB-TQ rights cheered at the Pride Rally outside of the City Council building Friday.

Brendan Owens
For The Pitt News

Students, politicians.and activists
holding rainbow ﬂags crowded City
Council’s steps Friday-evening to _

kick off Pittsburgh’s armual-Pride
Week. _
Pittsburgh Pride, launched the

celebration with rally attended by.

more than 100 people. The event
featured appearances by U.S. Rep.
Mike Doyle, D-Pa.,- legendary activ-
ist Harvey Milk’s nephew Stuart
Milk and Zack Wahls of YouTube
fame. . .

The Pittsburgh Pride Week cel-

ebration — which began in 1970_

— is a festival produced by the

"Delta Foundation of Pittsburgh. -

According to its website, Delta’s
mission is “to increase awareness
and understanding of and improve
the quality of life for the Lesbian,

Gay, Bisexual and Transgender_

(LGBT) community in Western
Pennsylvania.”

Pittsburgh Pride, which runs
fromjune 3-12, has events planned
throughout the week. These include
a pool party in Mt. Washington on

. Thursday, a pub crawl and youth
dance event on Friday, a street

party on Saturday and a parade‘

on Sunday. _

Even though school is out for
the summer. P_itt’s Rainbow Alli-
ance is ‘still taking part in many
of the events.Rainbow Alliance
President Tricia.Dougherty has
been participating in Ohio’s Pride

‘ Week since ‘she was 16, but this year
marks her ﬁrst time partaking in
the Steel City’s iteration.

“Pride is a good way of showing

the numbers of LGBTQ people and
their allies who would be ableto
mobilize on an issue. It is an event
that contains a great deal of po-
litical power, not just for marriage
equality but also for many issues,”
Dougherty said in an email. '
She said that Rainbow Alliance

. will have a table on Saturday at Pride

in the Streets, Pittsburgh’s largest
outdoor street party, featuring

acclaimed R&B singer—songwriter .

Patti LaBelle. The organization will
also be getting a group together to
walk in Sunday’s Pride Awareness
March on Liberty Avenue.

For Dougherty, the most im-
portant part of Pride Week is that
it gives her the opportunity to feel
connected to the Pittsburgh com-
munity. ~

' “My favorite thing about Pride
is being in a place where being
LGBTQ is the norm,’_’ Dougherty
said. V

Cody Dickerson, a junior Reli-
gious Studies and Chinese major

who attended the rally, said. that

Pride Week has a great effect on
him as a Pitt student.

“It adds something to being a
gay Pitt student. Pitt has pretty
clear policies and pretty good

policies, and Pittsburgh is one of»

the cities in.Pennsylvania' that has
sexual orientation protection, so
it’s not something I ever have to
be concerned about,” Dickerson
said. '

University of Missouri senior
Caleb Washbum, who attended the
rally with Dickerson, said the same
is not true of all universities.

"You have a lot of rural kids that
come into Missouri with very dif-
ferent opinions. There isn’t really

an out—atmosphere,” Washburn
said. - I

Pittsburgh was ranked the ﬁfth
gayest city in America in terms of
population, according to Advocate.
com, which markets itself as the
world’s leading source for LGBT
news, but Dougherty believes the
community still has room to im-
prove. ,
“Being LGBTQ at Pitt is a mixed
bag. At some points the environ-
ment is supportive, but at other
points it is clear that there is still
work to be done,” Dougherty said.

“For me, the issue is making sure

that students have a place where
they feel safe on campus.”

Doyle, who represents the
state’s 14th district, of which Pitts-
burgh is a part, announcedhis sup-
port of the LGBTQ community in
Pittsburgh at the rally.

“I have the privilege to rep-
resent Pittsburgh in the United
States Congress, and I am a strong
supporter of LGTB rights,” Doyle
said. “Let’s celebrate today, and
let’s redouble our efforts tomor-
row and the days and weeks and
months after that to keep pushing
for marriage equality, workplace

equality and equality in our Armed '

Forces.”

Max Garber, Rainbow Alliance
Community Outreach ofﬁcer, be-
lieves'that events like Pittsburgh
Pride will help the community un-
derstand what LGBTQ supporters
areﬁghting for. »

“When you gather and dem-
onstrate in a group, it lets people
know that there are a lot of us —
there are many of us, and we aren’t
necessarily what youthought of
us,” Garber said.‘ I

the world to know that.”

Kevin O’Conne1l, a spokesman for Eat’n
Park Hospitality Group, said that the proj-
ect was bid out fairly and that Bridges
matched the bid. He also said that the
carpenters union was included in the bid-
ding but did not bid on the project.

“From our perspective, the process was
very_fair and Bridges did a good job in
making sure the process was done fairly,”
O’Conne1l said.

O’Conne1l also said that he has talked
with thecarpenters union concerning fu-
ture potential projects, but for this project
Eat’n Park can only work with carpenters
who bid. ,

Shilling, on the other hand, said that
the union did in fact bid on the project.
He said that the bidding was by invita-
tion only, which he said was an attempt
to keep the union out of negotiations on
the project’s terms.

Only one out of the five bidders was a
representative from the union, Shilling

said. V

Sepesy said the carpenters union is pro-
testing Eat’n Park Hospitality’s choice of
Bridges as the site contractor, since the
company pays its workers less than area
standards recommend. .

Sepesy said that the project is impor-
tant because it is in the heart of the city
of Pittsburgh and Pitt.

“It tarnishes the image that Pittsburgh
and the'University stand for,” Sepesy
said.

He said it costs a lot of money to go to
Pitt and students’ parents work hard for
their money. The goal of the protest is to
make sure workers get fair pay for the
work they perform, Sepesy said.

“We just feel that people have a right
to know that Eat’n Park and the contrac-
tor are trying to get done as much as
possible for as least as possible,” Sepesy
said. “It-’s a tough economy, and now is
the time where people like this try to take
advantage of these types of situations”.

EDITORIAL

Outlaw texting,
not calling, while .

driving

When it comes to responsible
driving, most people will agree
that certain in—car activities —
eating, ﬁddling with an MP3 play-
er, texting — are to be avoided
at all costs.-

What some lawmakers fail to
grasp, however, is that not all
distractions are equally repre-
hensible. ‘

For a time, House Bill 8, which
was proposed by state Rep.‘Kath—
arine Watson, R—Bucks, seemed

, like a done deal. The legislation

would allow officers to stop and
fine drivers caught texting and
would add Pennsylvania to the
rapidly growing number of states
-- 32 total —— which-have out-
lawed the practice.

Then Rep. Josh Shapiro,
D-Montgomery, proposed an
amendment stipulating that
talking on hand—held cell phones
merited an equivalent punish-
ment.—Now, instead of undergo-
ing a ﬁnal ﬂoor vote, the bill has
been sent back to the notoriously
sluggish Appropriations Com-
mittee. '

We applaud Watson’s initial
bill —— there is no driving situa-
tion in which texting is preferable
to calling; the former is in fact
an entirely superﬂuous means of
communicating on the go. More
importantly, it’s also quite dan-
gerous. According to a statement
Watson made in May, studies have
demonstrated that even a “dex-
terous texter” will be looking at
something other than the road
for at least six seconds.

But Shapiro’s amendment is
both politically-inept and an af-
front to the purpose of driving
safety laws. ‘

Talking on the phone while

 

 

+3   .'¢ii9'5@Pl*?F9W$-.¢9“?.

driving — a practice outlawed

- in only eight states, accord-

ing to the Governors Highway
Safety Association — is one of
the few distractions that could
be justified. If a driver were lost

on ahighway with no place to

pull over, for example, a call to
an information center or friend
would seem reasonable.

Less drastically, if you’re
stalled in traffic for a half—hour
or more, a brief call to the office
could assuage co-Workers’ fears
that you’re snubbing an impor-
tant meeting.

This is not to say motorists
should make liberal use of their
cell phones. Nine times out of 10,
chatting on a phone while driv-
ing is indeed irresponsible. How-

ever, there are several scenarios
in which such an ability becomes
nothing less than vital.

If lawmakers actually wish to
eliminate driving distractions,
there are a million potential
threats they must contend with:
iPods, maps, even the radio.

Attempting to address many
of these concerns in a single bill
seems, in a word, overambitious.
Moreover, many of these “distrac—
tions” are, in certain situations,
quite necessary. To outlaw them

‘ without regard for their benefits

is foolhardy.

In any case, when it comes
to driving safety, Pitt students
need only exercise common
sense. Unless the matter is ur-

' gent, that call to your friend can

wait until you’re safely parked in
theisoldiers 8: Sailors Garage (if
you can get any reception). As for
texting, impersonal communica-
tion is overrated — whether it’s
on the road or off. ;;

COLUMN

Che’s mis   lced celebrit

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

When I walked down the street
recently, I saw an a1l—too-famil-
iar sight. I know you’ve seen it at
one time or another, and I hope
you summoned your best Bush-
choking—on-a—pretzel impression
when you did. Standing nearby,
casually smoking a cigarette and
handing out some kind of leaﬂet,
was a college—aged guy wearing a
Che Guevara shirt.

Maybe this shouldn’t have sur-
prised me. I’Ve heard that Cuba
has amazing beaches, and accord-
ing, to liberal ﬁlmmaker Michael
Moore, its health care system is
top—of—the-line. But in the end,
it’s safe to say Cuba isn’t at the
forefront of the world political
stage.

Nevertheless, for reasons I
struggle to understand, Che Gue-
vara remains a permanent ﬁxture
in Western culture. Yes, he loved
to read and was all about ending

_ imperialism, but all that makes

  xx 

him is a Gandhi wannabe. Oh,
and he ordered the execution of
prisoners in Cuban jails without
a fair trial.

Still, the trying—too—hard-to-
be-cool kids won’t stop wearing
his picture on their shirts.

I have three theories as to why
this occurs. First, people actu-
ally just like the shirt. You know,
it ﬁts the muscles well and the

red brings out the color of your

eyes or something. I have total
respect for these people. My fa-
vorite shirt in seventh grade was
an American Eagle shirt that said,
if I recall correctly, “Alaska!” I’ve
always wanted to see Russia from
America, but even Sarah Palin’s
binoculars won’t let me gaze upon
that frozen tundra. Regardless, I
wore the shirt. I loved the shirt. I
also wore a minor league baseball
team’s shirt all the time. I knew
nothing about the team, but the

shirt had a great color scheme. If .

you’re just about shapes and lines
and the-like, then more power to
you.

Unfortunately, I don’t think

_;  . , -xi:

this theory applies to the Che
shirts. After all, they’re not even
that cool. It’s not like Che was on
the cover of People magazine’s
100 Sexiest Men Alive. I guess the
Goodwill look is in right now, but
the shirt isn’t even plaid. So that
hypothesis is out.

The second theory is that the
people who wear these shirts are
actual communists. Now I’m no
_]oe McCarthy, but if “The Com-
munist Manifesto” is on your
nightstand, then you need to re-
evaluate your pleasure-reading
list. The Berlin Wall fell down,
and right now, China is about as
communist as Dick Cheney. My
mom always taught me to come
fashionably late to parties ——
you know, if I wanted to be prom
king and all —- but this party has
been over far longer than Sem-
pleFest.

Now this second theory of mine
also falls apart pretty quickly. Un-
less society banded together and
distributed Che shirts to every cit-
izen, that person probably bought

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Dear Mustache: Bateman counsels advice-seekers  

 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

As the greatest advice column in the
free world, the Moustache Column
of America has touched, caressed,
fondled and at times even groped the
lives of thousands. Until this week,
though, our readers have never been
given the opportunity to pose the
sort of hard-hitting, birds-and-bees
questions that Mom and Dad remain
forever afraid to answer. Now that
we’ve opened this Pandora’s mailbag,
it’s highly unlikely that any of you will
ever ﬁnd yourselves going hungry for
knowledge again. ~
Dear Mr., ' ,

l I am writingto see ifthe item you
are selling (one extra-good stair step-
per) is still available for sale per the
ad on Craigslist.

Thanks,

A.
A., this is one of the toughest mo-
ments in a young man’s life. Believe
us when we tell you that what’s hap-
pening with your body is not your
fault and that +— given sufficient time
— this too will pass. Until then, re-
member to keep aclean sheet under
your bed at all times.

Hi,
I have been having a real prob-
lem with my girlfriend. I don’t think

‘she loves me anymore. So in your

opinion, is “The Hangover” a bet-

ter movie than “The Hangover Part

II”?
Best,
B.

We’re glad you brought this to our

attention, B.. Despite the wealth of

ﬁlm criticism available on the Inter- _

net, it is almost impossible to deter-
mine if a movie is good or bad, let

alone if one is better than another. ,

In spite of this problem, known as
Ebert’s Paradox among cineastes,we
can assure you that “American Pie 2”
is almost universally regarded as the
best movie ever made. ' V ’

Dear, ' -

Hi, just wanted to know if you
thought Kevin Love is the best
baller.

‘Peace out,

C .

No, C., the bestbasketball player 

— and consult basketball-reference.
com if you don’t believe us — was
Isaiah “J.R.” Rider. In addition to his
monstrous slam dunks and hoop
jams, j.R. averaged an astonishing
16.7 points per game over the course

of a nine-year career. Even coach-
choker nonpareil Latrell “Spree”
Sprewell, sneaker company entre-
preneur Stephon “Starbury” Mar-
bury and man—mountain Glen “Big
Baby” Davis never ascended to such
rareﬁed heights. l

Hey Moustache,

Because of those $5 pies, I have
gained a few pounds over the last
coupleyears in college, and now my
khakis are getting tight around the
waist. I know you’re always writing
about getting jacked, so tell me what
to do.

Word,

D. P
D., you obviously haven’t been
paying attention to our previous col-
umns. If you had, you would know
that there’s avery simple solution to
your problem: Tell all of your friends
that you’ve entered the “hardgain-.
ing” phase of a bodybuilding career.
When they press you for more de-
tails, explain that you’re trying to add
as much mass as possible prior to a
“hydroxycutting/shr‘edding” phase
that will take place before you head to
the beach. This makes perfect sense
and will almost never be disputed.

Hey bro, »

Just another bro here wondering

what would be a good meal to eat the
morning after getting all crap -faced
and mega—frosty with a case or two
of Yuengling Black 8: Tan. V

Living it,

Your bro F.

Sweet question, bro! Indeed,
nothing can cramp one’s style quite
like the diarrhea, headache, lethargy
and extreme thirst that accompany
a terrible hangover (which, getting
back to another question in today’s

column, is yet another reason why -

the movie “The Hangover” — the
only side effect of which is 100 min-
utes of side-splitting hilarity — is
preferable to an actual hangover).

' During our wayward youth, we dealt

with more than our fair share of malt
liquor— and 151-induced hangovers.

In our humble opinion, nothing beats ‘

back those hangover blues quite like

our patent-pending “Belly Filler” ’

bread snack. _

Although we’ve kept this recipe
secret for many years, we’re going
to ‘share it with you, F., because you
seem like our kind of bro, especially
with all the getting crap—faced and
mega—frosty you seem to have been
doing. In order to make the “Belly
Filler,” you grab afew slices of bread
—— maybe ﬁve or six, and possibly

some spicy Cheetos if you’re feeling
adventurous -— and dunk them in
whatever kind of lukewarm ﬂuid is
at hand. Stale beer works ‘best, al-
though toiletbowl water can be used
in a pinch. (Note: If you’re going to
use water from the commode, re-
member to check that your bros have
ﬂushed!) After the bread gets all soft
and gooey, mold it into a huge ball
and shove it into your mouth. Chew-
ing — or, more accurately, gumming
— this enormous mass might prove
difficult at ﬁrst, but once you get the
ﬁrst few pieces down your throat,
the rest of it will seem’ like an ocean
breeze. Trust us: Once you’ve eaten
a delicious “Belly Filler,” that nasty

‘ old hangover:-will be the last thing

on-your mind. . I . r .

, Although we tried to1res’pond_-‘to
the most pressing questions in our
inbox, we realize that we might have
overlooked some real humdingers
(such as which celebrity has the “best
beach body of 2011,” to name just
one). If you’ve got a can’t-wait query
for the Moustache Club of America,
post it on our Twitter at http://twit-
ter.com/#!/MoustacheClubUS. For
a list of questions we’ve already an-
swered, check out moustacheclubo-

the shirt with his own money. Che
would have been pissed! It would

. be like speaking eloquently to

support George W. Bush or stay-
ing faithful to campaigns for Bill
Clinton — it just doesn’t suit the
man. Che probably wouldn’t want
people spending their capitalism-
earned wealth on possessions any
more than Michaeljordan wants
to be remembered for his baseball
career.

My third theory is thatpeople
want to seem like they go against
the mainstream and have some
better understanding of human
struggle, despite a lack of knowl-
edge about world issues. Unfor-
tunately, this isn’t conﬁned to
Che worship — people our age

have a general tendency to im- _

mediately latch onto the latest
political trend. How many college

students, for instance, champi-

oned Obama simply because
he was liberal and an eloquent

speaker? I’m not saying that we.

shouldn’t get involved and build
our own opinions of world is-
sues, but it’s important to have
well-informed reasons for joining
causes. By that, I mean that you
should probably know who Che
is before you wear a T—shirt with
his picture — a T—shirt which you,
as I mentioned, likely acquired

through a capitalist transaction.

Granted, it’s natural. and nor-
mal to try to distinguish ourselves
by cutting away from the main-
stream. The need to break from

V our expected norms is respon-

sible for more than just minding

- the bollocks with the Sex Pistols '

— it also spurred some of the
most successful social movements
ever, such as America’s civil rights
movement. As college students,

poor way to demonstrate independence

we’re at the time in our lives
where we begin to see the world
through our own lenses and make
up our own minds on social and
political issues. -
But it’s also important tha

we use this time to really edu-
cate ourselves. If you love Che
Guevara, that’s ﬁne — as long as
you know the story behind him.
just'don’t wear the T—shirt to be
cool. I

The Pittsburgh Biennial
Carnegie Museum of Art
- Heinz.Galleries
June 17 through September 18

, In Carnegie Museum’s Biennial

exhibition, the sound of a baby
crying‘ is part of the art this
time..

This year the Carnegie will join
four other locations, the Andy
Warhol Museum, the Miller Gal-
lery, Pittsburgh Filmmakers and
the. Pittsburgh Center for the Arts,
the event’s original developer, to
take part in the Pittsburgh Bien-
nial, which showcases local art-
ists. .

The nine artists whose work
will appear in the Carnegie will

featuredifferent mediums, but’
each created art focused on the I

concepts of work and labor, a
themedeveloped by Dan Byers,

the associate curator at the Oak- .
land museum and the exhibition’s

organizer. ‘ ’

B Conceptual artist Lenka-C1ay- V

ton, who Carnegie will feature,
was unsure whether she would be
- able to be a part of the Biennial

. Carnegie Museu

because she was pregnant with
her son Otto, who was-born in
April;during most of the exhibit’s
planning stages.

“There_is very little support
for freelance artists who have
children. It was a very big step
for me to imagine having a child,”
she said. - »

Originally from England, Clay-
ton would there have received a
monthly maternity-leave stipend

» from the British government be-

.

cause her career as a freelance
artist does not include certain
beneﬁts. '

Ellen James, a spokeswoman
for the Carnegie Museum of Art,

said that no such stipend exists in‘

the U.S.. So the Carnegie Museum
has agreed_to pay the equivalent

. of England’s maternity leave ben-
' _eﬁt for her artwork as an hono-

rarium. _ J _
“It’s a question about the value

of motherhood, the value of art— ‘

ists in society,” James said,
Because of her pregnancy,
Clayton found her own‘ way of

interpreting the Carnegie exhi—_

bition’s theme of work and labor.
The result is her piece “Maternity
Leave.” V . ‘ ‘
Instead of forgoing the oppor-
tunity to take part in the Biennial,

Clayton decided that her artwork
for the exhibition would evolve
from her absence. In her allot-
ted portion of the exhibit space,
there will be a white baby moni-
tor ‘sending a live feed from her
home, capturing Clayton and her
son’s private life. .

“I’m interested in putting to-
gether two very separate worlds,”
Clayton said referring to the pub-
lic and the private. "

Clayton compares the experi-

" ence of visiting her piece to “lis-

tening to a radio.” The audience
will understand that what they
hear is actually happening, al-
though they will not see it.
James hopes that the Biennial
gets people to notice local art-
ists like Clayton, who moved to
Lawrenceville in 2009, as well

_ as artists who have roots in or

connections to Pittsburgh.

_ “We hope the Pittsburgh Bien-
nial can help elevate the status of
local artists to a global setting,”
she said. _

The exhibition’s other eight
artists are Peggy Ahwesh, Steph-
anie Beroes, Brandon Boan, Ed
Eberle, Fabrizio G_erbino, Jamie
Gruzska, Zak Prekop and Frank
Santoro. The mediums the group
uses range from paint to video

to Clayton’s monitor.-James said
the exhibit’s theme relates to the

I actual way the artists work and

labor over their pieces, and she
feels this display demonstrates
the variety of mediums Pittsburgh
artists use.

While Clayton’s art is. about
hearing and not seeing, photogra-
pherjamie Gruzska’s contribution
is more visually oriented. The ad-

ministrator of the photography‘

program at Carnegie Mellon will
present 27 black—and-white pho-
tographs he produced in a dark
room. ' ’

The photographs — some of
which are from Gruzska’s ado-
lescence -— came from various
sets of negatives he’s taken over
the years. -In order to follow the
original process of the old photo-

. graphs, Gruzska chose to develop

them chemically rather than digi-
tally. . . _
“Because the negatives were

.made in a particular way, I feel

like I have a certain allegiance [to
them] ,” Gruzska said.-

The collection is a way for the
photographer to recreate his past
in images. He began working with
photography when he was 11, and
since he chose many of the pho-
tographs for the exhibition from

m hosts 9 artists for Biennial

his adolescence, the collection is.

helping him to reassess who he

was when they were taken.
Gruzska has interspersed cur-

rent photographs throughout the

exhibit as well, which he also de-
veloped chemically. Each photo-
graph will have a label referencing
the time Gruzska took and then
developed it, so that the audience
can differentiate between the two
time periods. _

“There’s sort of a spanning of
time. It’s exploring the idea oﬁi
memory,” he said.

The process of resurrecting
these photos and producing them
is how the photographer chose
to incorporate the exhibition’s
themes. (

“The process is trying to work
with that memory. The labor is
that — a way of making that
time alive again for me and for
the viewer. That’s what all the
work’s for,” Gruzska said.

Gruzska also said he is proud‘
to be a part of the Pittsburgh Bi-
ennial because of the sense of
community it evokes for both the
artist and the audience.

“Whether it’s conscious or not, .

I think there is a connection be-.-

In a Brooklyn living room one woman picks up
a bunch of tulips and throws them on them on
her hosts’ hardwood ﬂoor.

_ It’s part of the Pittsburgh Public Theater’s
latest show “God of Carnage” which begins

with what seems to be a calm meeting between.

two couples, Armette (Susan Angelo) and Alan
Raleigh (David Whalen) and Veronica (Deirdre
Madigan) and Michael Novak (Ted Koch).

’ The meeting inthe Novak’s living room’con—
cerns the pairs’ sons — the Raleigh boy hitthe
Novak boy with a stick at the park -— and the

parents soon begin ﬁghting. It’s during this.

that Annette angrily throws the blooms onto
‘the ﬂoor. , . ~ _

The 2009 Tony Award—winning show, writ-
ten by Yasmina Reza and directed by Ted Pap-
pas, plays untiljune 26.

The Raleighs are apowerful business couple
and the Novaks provide a contrast as rniddle—
class free spirits. As the story unfolds, original
loyalties begin to disintegrate, tulips ﬂy and the
adults lose all sense of composure.

There are few entrances and exits, and the
play occurs only in the Novak’s living room This
simplicity allows the actors to delve further into
their characters, as they constantly interact
with one another and their surroundings. .

The dynamic among the characters through-
out the play presents an honest look at reality

— with all of the issues bubbling under the
surface that sidetrack the characters. Loyalties
change depending on the moment, and the
couples alternate from being concerned only
with the well-being of their sons to forming
alliances based on other issues. ,

With each shift in topic come personal dis—- ’
' closures , sometimes turning the setting into

more of a confessional than a living room. .
Alan’s attachment to his cell phone and
Michael’s fake liberalism leave Annette and
Veronicabonding over rum, but that sympathy
falls to pieces when the two remember why
they’ve met in the ﬁrst place, and they’re thrust

' back into their initial dislike for each other.

Some, of the moments highlight the gen-
der roles‘present in the spouses’ relationships.

_ In these moments, the sexes sometimes side

with their own. Although the gender issue is
subtly woven into the plot and islcertainly not
its focal point, it affords the show an added
complexity. V V A

Despite the‘ complexities of the relation-
ships, each actor holds his or her own on the
stage and the storyline provides many comedic
moments for the audience. Whether it’s with an
obscene joke or awitty comment, the cast often
sends the audience into laughter.

The show is a fantastic reﬂection of that
fact that people frequently regress to primitive
states in environments meant to be tame ’—

‘even Brooklyn living rooms. The characters
become tame savages, ﬁghting over their dis-
agreements with no restraint.

But the play does not offer its characters
any sort of resolution. Both the Raleighs and
the Novaks continue to argue over the original
scenario until the end of the play, even though

.3

there are breaks from the original discussion _

for more personal arguments between the
couples. ,

“God of Carnage” ended with the audience
still laughing and nearly a complete standing
ovation. The multifaceted issues tainted with
a strong sense of humor lead to a very.well—
done play. . , .

MOVIE REVIEW

Fifth film explains Professor X and Magneto’s enmity

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ Writer

“X-Men: First Class” -
Starring:_]ames McAvoy, Michael Fassbender,
Jennifer Lawrence T

Director: Matthew Vaughn

Studio: Marvel Entertainment

Grade: B

The third “X-Men” ﬁlm was iffy and the fourth
ﬂopped — so when the trailers for “X—Men: First
Class,” a prequel to the former ﬂicks, ﬁrst ap-
peared, fans of the original movie groaned.

But those fans might have lamented too
quickly. “X—Men: First Class” breathes new life
into the series withanenergetic cast andanaction—
packed story. The plot shifts its focus from the
franchise’s main characters, instead telling the
tale of a newly varied group, including two of the
bigplayers ﬁ‘om previous installments, Professor
Xand Magneto. "

The “X-Men” series explores aworld inwhich
human mutations have created beings with spe-
cial powers. Themes of prejudice and acceptance
dominate throughout as mutants attempt to co-
existwithnormal humans, who ofcenfear orloathe
the powerful hybrids.

“First Class”focuses onthe leaders oftheﬁrture
mutant movement as young adults living during

the Cold War.

The movie departs a bit from the storyline
of the “X—Men” comics, which is understand-
able — as so many variations exist inthe comics
thattranslatingthe complex storiestothe screen
creates headaches for directors. It’s refreshing
to see ﬁlmmakers take inspiration from original
source material while putiing their own spin on
the story.

Theﬁlmfeatures the youngerversions of tele-
path Charles Xavier (james MCAVOY). later known

as Professorx, and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fass- '

bender), called “Magneto” because of his ability
to generate and control magnetism.

“First Class” begins withthe youngEriklosing
his mother in a concent:ratio’n camp during the
Holocaust. He spends the following years hunt-
ing down those responsible, seeking revenge.
Meanwhile, Charles lives with Raven (Jennifer
Lawrence), a shape shifter, as the pair of close
friends studyatoxford. I .

When a CIA agent comes to Charles for help,
fate brings him and Erik together during a brief
ﬁght against the ﬁlm’s villain, Sebastian Shaw
(Kevin Bacon) — a man from Erik’s past intent
on causing -nuclear war. The two then team up
to track down mutants around the world as they
search for potential help against the enemy. —

Throughout theﬁlrn, Charles believes thatthe
good he andhisfellowmutantscandonfor mankind
will outweigh the bad. Erik, doubtful, plows ahead

Forfans of the franchise, it’s blatantly obvious
during the ﬁlm what the ﬁnal outcome will be —
Professorx and Magneto as enemies. Despite this,

' Matthewvaughn spins atale interestingenoughto
‘keep all viewers entertained during thejourney.

The characters are rounded overall: Their
personalities develop over time, and they deliver
some humor along the way. They interact well as
comrades and also gradually exhibitthe fear and
betrayal that is inevitable in the story.

One of the best ‘—— and worst ——- parts of this
ﬁlm are the attempts to connect it with the other

‘parts of the franchise, such as showing the de-

sign for the ship  in previous movies. They
don’t always work and will sometimes leave fans
scratchingtheir heads. Buttl1eﬁlmis generallytied

This ﬁlm never quite succeeds in making the
setting feel like the 19605: The characters feel,

- dress and act too modem to pull the time period

oﬂ°. Butthisis aminorpitfall. Therearetimes when
the performances, too, lack believability because
of those too-modern touches, but that’s quickly
forgotten during the rivetingﬁnal battle. _

Overall, this is a slightly ﬂawed but fun addi-

tionto a popular series, and it certainly signals an '

upswingfrom the last two “X—Men” movies.I

GREGORIAN RANTS

NFL lockout should  
draw more concern 

Greg Trietley.

Senior Staff Writer

Am I the only person who realizes there’s
an NFL lockout?

An update about the labor strife sput-
ters out every few days, and the media
reports it as some major breakthrough.
But after the television correspondents
sign off from a courtroom in Minneapolis
or from a players-only workout at a high
school, the lockout — one with no end in
sight —— becomes a footnote.

Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports asked in a
column this week if a team will “take a ﬂyer
on” Plaxico Burress, who was released from
prison on Monday. The column compared
Burress to fellow jailbird Michael Vick,
mused about his personality and worried
about his age (33), but there was one thing it
didn’t mention —- the lockout that prevents
Burress from signing with any team.

That’s a glaring omission in an article
asking if someone will sign him.

It’s a signof the unspoken rule in sports

coverage over the past few weeks: If we

pretend it’s not there, the lockout, for now,
goes away. -

Yahoo! Sports opened the 2011 version
of its fantasy football game to registra-
tion last week. You can read expert de-
bate on whether or not Roddy White is a
better draft option than Calvin Johnson,
but they’re both looking ata zero-catch
September.

And although several major publica-
tions, ESPN and USA Today included,
quietly pushed back the release of their
fantasy preview magazines, plenty are still
available on newsstands.

My fantasy advice: If there’s a season
to draft Bubba Franks, who hasn’t stepped
on the gridiron in two years, make it this
one, ' 4

The biggest culprit of this lockout cha-
rade was the NFL Draft. It gave us the il-
lusion that everything would be ﬁne. The
commissioner shook hands with each
draftee, who sported his new team’s jer-

sey and cap. Same as always. Nothing had '

changed, right? .

_ Well, players can’t sign with the teams
that drafted them, and good luck to any
franchise that wants to trade one of them.
In the meantime, we have videos of play-
ers trying to open the locked glass doors
of team facilities. The look they give —
“What’s going on?” meets “I’m a sad puppy
looking for a home” — is more entertaining
than any football game.

The lockoutis currently a postscript
tacked on to every story, and nothing
more. _ ’ .

Tampa Bay will cut Aqi_b Talib  when

the lockout ends. The Bears and Buccaneers
will play in London this season  unless
the lockout extends past August 1. The NFL
will implement new rules to crack down on
ﬂagrant hits  eventually.

Coverage of the lockout itself has fo-
cused on court proceedings during which
the players association argues that the
labor conﬂict hurts its feelings, is uncon-
stitutional and assassinated Kennedy, or

something like that. If theplayerswinland. H‘

a judge ends the lockout, football returns,
right? , '
That’s naive thinking. The courtroom

arguments between the NFL andvthe NFL- ._ I -
PA are more divorce court than marriage‘ V
counseling. A judge can give the players «
. leverage, but a judge won’t write a new

collective bargaining agreement, which
the league, well, sort of needs.

But Miami Dolphins ticket packages are
on sale now!

It’s important to remember that unless
you’re a team employee laid off because of
this ordeal, the lockout hasn’t affected you
yet. No one cares about offseason workouts
or the rookie symposium. And really, pre-
season games won’t be missed either.

It will take the (scheduled) ﬁrstlweek
of the regular season before it sinks in.
Imagine the horror at 1:03 p.m. on Sept.
8. You sit down to watch the Steelers at

. the Ravens, but it’s»not there. In its place:
. motocross. Get it off! Get it off! Maybe the

game’s on a different network‘? Oh, now it’s
a cooking show.

Meanwhile, football players will fall ‘

from the limelight. We care about Terrell
Owens because he scores touchdowns, or

_ at least used to. Without football, he’s just

another guy trying to cram a 300—character
thought into a 140—character tweet.

As the lockout extends into winter and
the well of labor news runs dry, sports
television will devolve into talking heads
repeating the same trite expressions over
and over, and then the network looping
that segment over and over. Kind of like
the NBA Finals coverage. ‘

For fans, Sundays will become pro-
ductive. Compacted couch cushions will
ﬁnd time to heal. Arm rests will slowly
degrease. . ‘

Other sports will gain transient viewers,
Suddenly, Pitt football will have a bandwag-
on, forged from iron and painted black and
gold. Even the United Football League will
ﬁnd a fan. Movies, museums,‘ symphonies
and plays all will see increased attendance.
Seven billion dollars in annual NFL revenue
will go elsewhere, which gives both sides
an urgency to reach a deal.

Until then, it’s like thelockout isn’t even
here. I - ‘
